[09:26:52] <godSend23> hey all
[09:31:00] <larryv> hi
[09:31:14] <godSend23> hi larryv 
[09:34:00] <godSend23> do u know if libera has a grep bot?
[09:34:58] <larryv> you can /msg shbot, which has grep
[09:35:40] <godSend23> ooh
[09:36:00] <godSend23> for any channel in a given time frame even if i wasn't present?
[09:36:31] <larryv> what do you mean
[09:36:59] <godSend23> for searching content
[09:37:40] <larryv> you're asking about searching channel logs?
[09:37:58] <godSend23> yes
[09:38:18] <godSend23> i don't want to ask redundant ques that's been asked before
[09:38:23] <larryv> channels are not universally logged
[09:41:13] <godSend23> oh alright
[09:50:06] <godSend23> shouldn't they be?
[09:51:01] <larryv> why?
[09:55:35] <godSend23> like i mention earlier
[09:57:48] <larryv> it would be ridiculous to publicly log everything everyone on this network says just so you can avoid asking questions that have been answered already
[09:58:21] <larryv> anyway this is the policy https://libera.chat/policies/#public-logging
[09:58:28] <larryv> public logging is a per-channel thing

[19:48:32] <OnlineCop> I'm using a Docker container (GNU grep but no ripgrep, ack, etc.) and often need to count how many time a pattern occurs. Using `grep -c` lists files with 0 occurrences, `grep -lc` lists the files but excludes the count. Do I need to create a bash function to chain `PATTERN='regex'; grep -l "$PATTERN" | xargs grep -c "$PATTERN"` in order to only return files containing 1 or more matches?
