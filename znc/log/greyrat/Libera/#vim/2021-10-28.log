[00:02:07] <yolo_> 8.1.2269 that is
[00:02:21] <yolo_> yeah normally neovim Plug works in vim without issues
[00:02:29] <romainl> no
[00:02:32] <habamax> normally not
[00:03:24] <yolo_> then what a pity, all my servers have vim installed, none had the fancy neovim thing, vim is still universal, which is what sells, neovim is not

[00:11:30] <romainl> there is a check for 8.0 somewhere, another one for a specific Neovim version… it's just a mess.
