[01:49:14] <riv> that sounds different to what im used to: The group being the group of invertible fractional ideals
[01:49:21] <riv> im not sure how these would match up?
[01:49:38] <droid3> Does this imply we have n distinct factorization of a given number
[01:50:44] <droid3> What i am getting at riv is if you compute the class number for a the ring of integers in your number field.
[01:51:36] <droid3> Does this imply that the class number gives you the number of distinct ways the ring elements factor into primes.
[01:52:54] <droid3> Say for example Z[sqrt(-5)] this is a ring of integers in the number field Q(sqrt(-5)).
[01:53:14] <riv> not every number has n factorizations, that's the worst possible failure of unique factorization
[01:53:35] <droid3> Its class number is 2. So does this mean every ring element can be factored into to distinct factorizations ?
[01:54:42] <droid3> riv so if you got a class number = n that means that at most a ring element can factor into is n distinct factorization but some may have only one or less then n.

[01:55:13] <riv> it's cleaner to think about ideals though

[01:56:02] <droid3> Its hard to tell this because when your in a commutative ring that not even an integer domain primes elements arent necessarily irreducible elements
[01:56:44] <droid3> and so what does it even mean to factorize at this point?
[01:57:56] <riv> informally class number n means that there is 1 fractional ideal for every n principal ideals
[01:58:09] <droid3> But i imagine regardless the class number tells you the upper bound on how many ways one could possible break down a ring element even though it might not be breaking it down into primes or irreducible elements
[01:58:17] <riv> sorry other way around
[01:58:27] <riv> there are n fractional ideals for every principal ideal

[02:04:06] <droid3> Any case my example the traditional Z[sqrt(-5)] ring of elements has a class number = 2 so you can define them for more general noninteger domains aka commutative rings
[02:07:51] <droid3> riv for example i just thought there was a connection between class number = 2 and the fact that 6 = 2x3 = (1+sqrt(-5))(1-sqrt(-5)) aka 6 having two distinct factorization
[02:08:00] <riv> there is, absolutely
[02:08:15] <riv> im just saying that you can look at it another way

[02:51:41] <droid3> z-module trivially in any noninteger commutative ring  we have 0 factoring into an infinite never ending different factorizations because of zero divisor property not holding.
[02:52:20] <droid3> noninteger => nonintegral domain
[02:53:59] <droid3> But z-module from what you said are there some integer domains that have only a finite number of distinct factorization for element but arent dedekind domains because then class group would be missing analysis for those objects.
[02:55:02] <droid3> But sure in general your integer domain as well as noninteger domain rings may fail to have a finite amount of distinct ways to factorize an element.
[02:55:29] <droid3> And dedekind as of current seems to be the most general domain we can use
[02:55:41] *** Joins: seninha (~seninha@user/seninha)
[02:55:53] <droid3> at least to define class groups as me and riv where talking on.
[02:56:54] <droid3> And i was a bit curious on if there was any other tool for analysis of more general factorization properties for more general integral domains or even as general as commutative rings
[02:57:58] <droid3> And it seems not to be the case. Luckily number field are all dedekind domains so class group applies in alot of settings still.

[03:06:59] <droid3> like a factorization can be into just more reducible elements or a factorization might require it to be a product of irreducible elements.
[03:08:38] <droid3> So maybe if when your in a integer domains that isnt dedekind or even more generally a commutative ring with zero divisors. They if we restrict a factorization as only a factorization into irreducible elements
[03:08:53] <droid3> Maybe then we have enough structure to analysis
[03:09:28] <droid3> and just forget about the never ending different factorization into reducible elements.

[03:14:19] <droid3> since primes dont need to be irreducible  at this point in general rings. And irreducible that make up a ring element   need not be finite
[03:14:42] <droid3> With UFD we got nice stuff like primes = irreducible
[03:15:21] <droid3> In the case where where in even an integer domain we still have primes are irreducible but irreducible need not be prime.
[03:16:23] <droid3> So its hard to see how to generalize factorization we could go primes , or irreducible or both , or any reducible factors/any factors ..etc

[16:37:46] <tmyklebu_> given a direction x, computing the farthest vertex v(x) in direction x is easy.  the width of the largest triangle with apex v(x) of height h inscribed in your polygon whose base is perpendicular to x is a piecewise concave quadratic function in the region that matters.  maybe sweeping x across the unit circle, together with some complicated data structures, gets you where you want to go.

[17:17:50] <[itchyjunk]> so if z_1 = (x,y) and z_2 = (u,v) with f(z_1) = z_2 then f(x+iy) = u + iv.

[22:20:34] <cuppajoeman> Can someone help with my proof for the definition of abs val? https://i.imgur.com/gCKGjAZ.png
[22:21:19] <cuppajoeman> It seems like I need to show that (x^2)^(1/2) = -x
[22:21:38] <cuppajoeman> but I don't see where that's goign to come from algebraically
[22:21:49] <droid3> i think i am most impressed with the fact that for a dedekind domains and thus for all number field as a special case. That the class number is always finite implies that any ring of integers that is not a UFD. Factorize into at most the class number of different factorization for a given ring element.
[22:22:08] <TheHermann> Juliu, what do you mean? Juliu
[22:22:22] <droid3> That kind of a big deal as it basically say's when we dont have UFD it only off by a class number amount for a given element.
[22:22:34] <cuppajoeman> It makes sense for negative numbers though, clearly if x = -1 the above formula works
[22:22:36] <Juliu> cuppajoeman, sqrt( (-x)^2 ) = sqrt( x^2 ) = x
[22:23:03] <cuppajoeman> I need to show that sqrt( x^2 ) = -x
[22:23:09] <cuppajoeman> do you see the prf?
[22:23:20] <Z-module> cuppajoeman: it's only true for x <= 0
[22:23:25] <cuppajoeman> yes
[22:23:29] <cuppajoeman> I'm having trouble for it
[22:23:38] <cuppajoeman> I can do it with concrete examples
[22:23:41] <droid3> That makes it in some case a task for a computer to know that you broke down an element into all its possible distinct factorizations.
[22:23:42] <TheHermann> Juliu, ok maybe i understand
[22:23:49] <cuppajoeman> but I don't really understand how to get it algebrically with x
[22:24:57] <Z-module> the rule  (x^a)^b = x^(a^b)   doesn't hold in general. It does if x >= 0, though.
[22:25:33] <Juliu> cuppajoeman, for x <= 0: sqrt(x^2) = sqrt((-x)^2) = -x
[22:25:56] <Z-module> if x < 0, so |x| = -x,  then  x^2 = (-x)^2 = |x|^2,  and |x| > 0  so *now* you can use  (|x|^2)^(1/2) = |x|^(2 * 1/2) = |x| = -x
[22:27:06] <Z-module> sorry, I meant the rule  (x^a)^b = x^(ab)
[22:27:11] <Z-module> that only generally works if x >= 0

[22:31:42] <cuppajoeman> oops it might have formatted it wrong
[22:32:06] <cuppajoeman> Ok, it makes sense for me, and a counter example for it?

[22:32:46] <cuppajoeman> ok, so if I put a = -1 i might be able to find a counter example
[22:34:19] <Z-module> yes,  -1 = (-1)^((2)(1/2)) != ((-1)^2)^(1/2) = 1^(1/2) = 1

[22:35:03] <Z-module> the problem is that nth roots of nonnegative reals, like 1^(1/2), choose the unique nonnegative root by definition.
[22:35:55] <Juliu> I think there is no counter example for all integer exponents
[22:37:00] <cuppajoeman> So for intger exponents then a can be anything in R

[22:38:20] <Juliu> Yes, but so a can NOT be anything in R
[22:38:45] <cuppajoeman> Ok, so for real exponents, we have (x^a)^b = x^(ab) for when x >= 0
[22:38:49] <Juliu> Anything other than 0 should work for integer exponents
[22:39:25] <cuppajoeman> and a,b > 0
[22:39:30] <cuppajoeman> is that correct?

[23:16:18] <cuppajoeman> I'm still a little confused, when we write log_b(a) = y <=> x = b^y, does this define exponentiation and log simultaneously?
[23:16:27] <cuppajoeman> Or is b^y already defined
[23:16:31] <riv> in terms of construction
[23:16:35] <cuppajoeman> And if it is what is it's definition
[23:16:37] <riv> we define the exp : R -> R function

[23:17:11] <riv> then (^) : R x R -> R next, using those two functions
[23:17:45] <cuppajoeman> so exp doesn't have a definition in terms of how it would change an element?
[23:17:59] <riv> or is that actually, (^) : R_{>0} x R -> R
[23:18:31] <riv> exp can be defined as an infinite summation or as a solution to f' = f
[23:18:35] <riv> f(0) = 1
[23:19:01] <cuppajoeman> is exp e^x right
[23:19:12] <riv> exp(x) = e^x is true
[23:19:27] <riv> once you ahve defined e = exp(1) and the (^) function
[23:19:51] <riv> alternatively, you can define log as an integral of 1/x and exp as its inverse
[23:20:11] <cuppajoeman> So the definition of e^x is the infinite summation right?
[23:20:18] <riv> exp(x) not e^x
[23:20:24] <kakashiA1> if you want to calculate the derivative, you have to come from both side
[23:20:26] <cuppajoeman> I thought they were the same?

[23:23:48] <cuppajoeman> (quick question how can we define exp(x) = Sum[n=0, inf] x^n /n!, the thing on the right contains the exponent right??)
[23:23:58] <riv> that's a great point
[23:24:06] <riv> the reason this is ok is because n is a natural number here
