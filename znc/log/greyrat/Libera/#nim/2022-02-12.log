[07:39:03] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> https://github.com/beef331/nimterface/blob/master/test.nim ok
[07:39:21] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I could make a converter for every permutation a type implements
[07:39:27] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Which sounds like hell to do
[07:39:47] <FromDiscord> <sOkam!> In reply to @demotomohiro "`nimbase.h` should be in": is that the system binary?↵I installed with choosenim, dunno if that could change things
[07:39:49] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> But right now one needs to do `toImpl(BoundObject, DuckObject)` or w/e the concepts are named
[07:40:19] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I say permutation but i think that'd be combination
[07:40:32] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Hmm okay interesting
[07:40:52] <nrds> <06Prestige99> my brain wants "type Foo implements Bar" but that's not bad
[07:41:45] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Ehh it can do `MyObject.implements BoundObject, DuckObject` when i clean it up
[07:42:11] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> the `toImpl` is for conversion
[07:42:21] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Since this supports converting to an object with a vtable for dispatch
[07:43:32] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Ref is really kicking my ass though

[07:58:24] <FromDiscord> <Rika> strange then
[07:58:30] <FromDiscord> <Rika> nimbase.h is right there
[07:58:40] <FromDiscord> <Rika> and it has the proper `-I` switch
[08:00:45] <FromDiscord> <demotomohiro> If you have `nimbase.h` but gcc says no such file, I think that means path in `-I` is wrong.
[08:01:06] <FromDiscord> <Rika> In reply to @Rika "`ls ~/.choosenim/toolchains/nim-1.6.2/lib`": i wrote the path written in the `-I` option here.

[08:09:59] <FromDiscord> <sOkam!> not sure how to check thought, never used that app
[08:10:01] <FromDiscord> <noow> neither would confine gcc by default, unless your distro ships with a profile
[08:10:10] <FromDiscord> <Rika> it probably doesnt
[08:10:14] <FromDiscord> <Rika> its arch he says
[08:10:15] <FromDiscord> <sOkam!> i doubt arch ships with any profile
[08:10:19] <FromDiscord> <noow> if you really wanna check sudo aa-status should display all profiles being used
[08:10:32] <FromDiscord> <noow> also, to enable apparmor you'd need to add a kernel boot flag manually
[08:11:02] <FromDiscord> <sOkam!> module says loaded, filesystem not mounted
[08:11:27] <FromDiscord> <noow> then it's not interfering

[08:15:03] <FromDiscord> <noow> maybe try expanding the ~ manually

[08:15:19] <FromDiscord> <demotomohiro> `echo -I~` doesn't expand to home directory on my termux.
[08:15:59] <FromDiscord> <demotomohiro> `echo ~` works.

[08:18:59] <FromDiscord> <demotomohiro> So you need to pass full path to -I option.
[08:19:03] <FromDiscord> <sOkam!> dunno what the new error means though, that thing it complains about was pregenerated by the compiler
[08:19:19] <FromDiscord> <noow> does nimbase.h get copied to the cache

[08:20:14] <FromDiscord> <noow> maybe some header files are both in .choosenim/toolchains/nim-1.6.4/lib and .cache/nim/lib_d ?
[08:20:58] <FromDiscord> <noow> what happens if you exclude the latter
[08:22:03] <termer> Is there anything like JavaScript's setTimeout and clearTimeout in async Nim? There's asyncdispatch.addTimer, but there doesn't seem to be any way to cancel it. My use-case here is a authentication timeout on an asychronous server

[08:23:41] <FromDiscord> <noow> hmmm the lib.h is there, which the guide mentions as being essential

[08:24:34] <FromDiscord> <sOkam!> In reply to @noow "hmmm the lib.h is": the nim compilation outputs to the cache essentially
[08:26:40] <FromDiscord> <noow> yeah sorry
[08:26:47] <FromDiscord> <noow> i read the guide, and the lib.h is generated by it
[08:26:58] <FromDiscord> <noow> i am out of ideas sorry
[08:29:31] <FromDiscord> <haolian9 (高浩亮)> while reading about `std/asyncfile`, i found `openAsync` would block the whole thread; what if the file to be opened by `openAsync` lives in a power off (spin down?) disk? or is there an async wrapper on `open(2)` in nim?
[08:30:12] <FromDiscord> <demotomohiro> That error message says multiple .c file defines same global variable or function. Maybe excluding one of .c file fix it.
[08:31:09] <FromDiscord> <noow> maybe clear the cache and recompile

[08:58:08] <FromDiscord> <sOkam!> So now, having this `lib.h` file...↵What files do I need to store inside the engine so the bytecode compiler knows what to do with it?↵Is `nimbase.h` self contained, or does it link to more things internally that would need to be copied over too?
[09:00:30] <FromDiscord> <Rika> afaik self contained
[09:01:32] <FromDiscord> <sOkam!> Does compilation require the stuff that's output to the cache too? (other than the lib.h file that is)

[17:37:49] <FromDiscord> <sOkam!> _its probably a dummy question, but I'm kinda confused by the wording sry_ 😔
[17:51:44] <FromDiscord> <haolian9 (高浩亮)> @\_discord\_186489007247589376\:t2bot.io  IMO `switch` is for compiler, in your case `os.commandLineParams`, .paramCount, .paramStr should be used
[18:12:54] <FromDiscord> <sOkam!> is it possible to have named parameters by default, or do I have to code a string search in the paramter list/seq?
[18:13:06] <FromDiscord> <Schelz> Does anyone know why "DirectNimrod" test examples gives "Error: cannot open file: windows"

[18:14:58] <FromDiscord> <Rika> ah you mean named options?
[18:15:39] <FromDiscord> <Rika> you need to do the latter i believe
[18:33:21] <FromDiscord> <sOkam!> Hmmm, is this not how `os.commandLineParams` is meant to be used? 🤔 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/371759389889003532/942073396362117150/unknown.png

In theory it is, but i'm just really confused understanding it https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/371759389889003532/9421152824
[21:21:47] <FromDiscord> <sOkam!> The confusing part is: how does any give the current seq element to the procedure? 🤔
[21:21:57] <FromDiscord> <sOkam!> (edit) "any" => "any()"
[21:22:08] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It iterates over it calling `pred`
[21:22:23] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Personally i'd do `commandLineParams.anyit(it == arg)`
[21:22:44] <FromDiscord> <sOkam!> why anyIt and not any?
[21:22:46] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> well `commadnLineParams().`
[21:24:12] <FromDiscord> <sOkam!> ah wait, anyIt allows for redefining what you check, vs being forced to use the iterator?
[21:24:21] <FromDiscord> <sOkam!> (edit) "anyIt" => "any()"
[21:24:31] <FromDiscord> <sOkam!> (edit) "iterator?" => "iterator like anyIt()?"
[21:27:30] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> `anyIt` is not an iterator, it is a template that unfolds into `for` loop that does the checking
[21:27:50] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> and for `seq[T]` and `T` there is an `in

[21:28:25] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Oh right they're just checking if the container contains arg

[21:33:09] <FromDiscord> <sOkam!> how do I return that specific seq item that matches `arg` after that?↵is `filter( ... )` a good choice, or is there a better method?
[21:34:12] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> `commandLineParams().find(arg)`
[21:34:23] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> returns -1 if it's not in the collection
[21:39:33] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> `imports std/[macros, typetraits]`

[21:44:27] <FromDiscord> <sOkam!> i understand that right now its not looking for param, but for the whole string with a hardcoded thing, not a wildcard thing. that's what I'm trying to figure out
