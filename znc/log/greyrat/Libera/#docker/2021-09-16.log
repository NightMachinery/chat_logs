[02:19:36] <tabakhase> Gamara your dockerfile is never build

[02:20:44] <tabakhase> then on up compose will first check if the image exist, then attempt to pull if from the hub, and then try to build it
[02:21:14] <tabakhase> right now it bails as ok on step 2, you want it to hit 3
[02:22:39] <Gamara> I removed the image from  php-cli
[02:22:59] <Gamara> in docker-compose

[02:24:19] <Gamara> ok its working now sort of thank you so much tabakhase
[02:24:23] <tabakhase> (later on youll also have "docker-compose build" or even "docker-compose up --build" to force a build -- but if thats just php, you can likely use a bindmount in there (as ./client/public does) in there, and restart rather than rebuild the container "docker-compose up --force-recreate php-cli")

[04:02:12] <pipapipapipo> I have containerize my django application with docker-compose... I notice that I have to run django-compose -f <compose file> up -d --build in order to manually build and run my containers.
[04:03:13] <pipapipapipo> *docker-compose... I am looking to deploy on aws. Any pointers how I get the containers to run in that environment?
[04:04:22] <pipapipapipo> is this something that docker also solves or should I look at something like terraform?

[04:10:56] <tabakhase> pipapipapipo yes&no...
[04:11:30] <tabakhase> "kicking the deployment" in one way or another youll have anywhere with anything - usually part of ci-pipelines
[04:12:23] <tabakhase> from there compose is more a development-only thing these days i guess - but nothing particular "wrong" with just running that on a ec2 either
[04:15:14] <pipapipapipo> oh I see. Do you have recommendation where to implement ci-pipelines for deployment?
[04:15:35] <pipapipapipo> I might have to look into gitlab rather than github
[04:18:02] <tabakhase> im certainly a gitlab fan myself =)
[04:19:12] <tabakhase> but in the end, it rly doesnt matter all that much, docker itself is fine to handle remotes, and for anything else there is ssh :P (also docker-via-ssh)

[19:50:39] <goddard> i usually use linux but it has issues for me right now
[19:51:12] <wez>  What issue is that?  Fixing a Linux issue is easier than fixing a Windows issue
[19:51:45] <goddard> it just doesn't prioritize user actions over background processes well
[19:52:03] <goddard> i can't have something running in the background while using the computer
[19:52:12] <wez> goddard: yes it does
[19:52:34] <goddard> the CUDA task destroys linux

[20:09:02] <gordonjcp> even Office 365 - which is a web-based thing and ought to be OS-agnostic - doesn't work in Windows
[20:10:05] <goddard> hey man i actually like Linux but some things just are setup for Linux and it makes it harder to get going.  I say that as some one that has used Linux for over 10 years.
[20:10:13] <goddard> aren't
[20:10:39] <gordonjcp> hm, I can't say I've run into that
[20:10:55] <goddard> depends what you do
[20:11:04] <gordonjcp> the closest thing is video editing, where Resolve doesn't entirely like AAC-format audio in its Linux build
[20:11:11] <goddard> linux has a lot of rough edges
[20:11:19] <gordonjcp> so there's a slight manual step of converting everything to PCM with ffmpeg
[20:11:29] <gordonjcp> but I prefer cutting audio in PCM anyway
[20:11:47] <gordonjcp> OMG filesize PCM is uncompressed the files are 5% bigger OMGZOMG
[20:11:48] <gordonjcp> yeah
[20:11:55] <gordonjcp> here's a tenner, buy yourself a real hard disk
[20:12:19] <goddard> meanwhile flatpak and snap are over engineered solutions to elf/appimage just to save 35MBs of space on libreoffice
[20:12:44] <goddard> all the linux answers are terrible and their priorities are terrible because they have no leader
[20:12:50] <ada_> not a fan of either
[20:13:50] <goddard> its sad

[20:14:21] <gordonjcp> Office 365 won
[20:14:45] <goddard> simple things do not work well
[20:15:07] <goddard> the attitude around linux is that you will fix all your own problems
[20:15:23] <goddard> no intelligence to save the user
[20:15:35] <gordonjcp> yes, and?
[20:15:36] <goddard> i have 1 example
[20:16:03] <goddard> if you reboot your system 3 times and do an improper shutdown Windows intelligently suggests helping you
[20:16:09] <goddard> you know what Ubuntu does?
[20:16:11] <goddard> nothing
[20:16:21] <gordonjcp> which is the correct thing to do
[20:16:28] <goddard> in fact they made it difficult to even see the grub menu
[20:16:40] <goddard> now many distros are using systemd boot 
[20:16:58] <goddard> no it is a poor user experience
[20:17:07] <goddard> lack of intelligence and planning 
[20:17:52] <gordonjcp> why is it a poor user experince?
[20:17:55] <gordonjcp> *experience?
[20:17:58] <wez> goddard: incorrect
[20:18:04] <gordonjcp> Windows sounds like a poor user experience
[20:18:09] <wez> Windows works as Microsoft expects and dictates
[20:18:09] <goddard> because no everyone is a super 1337 hax0r like you
[20:18:15] <wez> if you want to go beyond that you are on your own

[20:18:29] <goddard> i agree

[20:25:03] <goddard> i have a 66 mustang 
[20:25:08] <gordonjcp> everyone should drive 7.5 tonne lorries

[20:25:35] <goddard> this is common amoung linux users

[23:08:13] <node1> How we can use docker in distributed computing?>
[23:09:47] <akik> node1: use docker swarm to create a cluster of hosts
[23:10:34] <node1> And then? Should we use it study large sets of data for machine learning related computing stuff?
[23:11:20] <akik> node1: i don't know who we is
[23:11:31] <node1> means?
[23:11:51] <akik> node1: i use zerotier to connect some docker swarm worker nodes over the internet
[23:13:20] <node1> I see.
[23:16:28] <node1> Container is great technology, to automate and accelrate the development workflow. I'm not sure how we can use in data science to study large sets of data.
[23:16:54] <artok> same kind of thing as you would do it without containers
[23:17:28] <artok> now only you can launch same runtime in any datacenter and any number of them more easily
[23:18:08] <artok> and easily grow horizontally your workers
[23:18:27] <node1> artok, But it's resource exhaustion intensive work.
[23:18:32] <artok> it's deployment tool
[23:18:58] <artok> so you start more nodes and connect them into same cluster, and keep starting those worker processes
[23:19:06] <node1> I'm not sure but everyone has different perspective of development.
[23:20:08] <node1> Aha your talking about deployment. How about continuos integration?
[23:20:46] *** Quits: physikoi (~physikoi@user/physikoi) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[23:20:56] <node1> The major life cycle work is being carried out on CI.
[23:21:02] <artok> would I'd be far off if I'd guess world is close to 95% of CI working on containers...
[23:21:49] <artok> because containers are fast to be created and destroyed, rolling updates done easily
[23:22:09] <node1> I have seen some legacy way where one used jail and chroot for the development.
[23:22:19] <artok> and you can also roll back in some seconds
[23:22:34] <artok> containers are way to do chroot jails
[23:22:38] <node1> Yes versioning and snapshot makes it powerfull 
[23:22:50] <artok> they add just networking into play
[23:23:04] <artok> "just" being here used quite freely
[23:23:50] <artok> every container get's it's own ip etc (unless forcing network into non-nat mode)
[23:24:51] <artok> CI into one cluster, then deployment into another
[23:25:20] <artok> having own image registry for images is great also
[23:25:46] <node1> yes.

[23:34:50] <physikoi> Hi #docker. Can someone point me to a guide on maintaining separate (php composer) vendor directories on both host and container volume? I know that I can use a named volume to persist data in container (EG: myvol:/var/www/html/vendor). However, i'm getting confused because vendor is at the root of my project and i'd like to a bind volume for development (EG: ./:/var/www/html). Halp? ty

[23:54:54] <physikoi> tabakhase: i think there would be no issue with vendor files, come to think of it. Potential problems arise when trying to maintain separate local and container volume node_modules files as some packages require compilation. One that is relevant to my case is node-sass; local environment is macos, while container image is linux based

[23:56:57] <tabakhase> physikoi ye as mentioned above, node_modules is a known issue (especially for downer-on-windows users, there it will literally 'explode') - but then the "overlaying with named vol" & having your entrypoint install is usually "fine"
[23:57:37] *** Quits: node1 (~node1@user/node1) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:57:50] <tabakhase> guess to point one more common issue with this -- on windows even the "docker build" explodes, so one has to use a ".dockerignore" file to make it skip the folder on zipping (works like gitignore)
[23:59:10] <tabakhase> but then its kinda also a "non-docker-issue" what todo with your local copy (installing windows-node and letting your IDE handle it or such isnt unseen)
[23:59:47] <physikoi> Glad i'm not using windows. "Overlaying" suggests to me that volume order in docker-compose matters, right? So, i might want ./:/var/www/html, node_modules:/var/www/html/node_modules ?
