[00:05:35] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> Nice!  I was also working on the runtime evaluation (dynamicAgain branch), which kinda works, but it cannot yet put values into the vm. And I'm unsure if both models can work the same, I don't know if I can (and should) feed all visible variables and procs into the vm.
[00:07:03] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> I think it would be better to allow explicitly listing "captured" variables, for basic interop support
[00:07:12] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> Yes
[00:07:14] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> But not necessarily all.
[00:07:31] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Although I don't know what would be the best approach for that either
[00:08:02] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Need more use cases& requirements and then expected behavior can be formulated
[00:08:21] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> Then maybe, I should look for alternatives to make the development workflow more pleasant,  maybe automatic shared object compilation/loading/binding
[00:09:28] <FromDiscord> <RattleyCooper> Anybody know what compile times are like on a raspberry pi 4?  My computer totally died Saturday night ðŸ˜¢   I can't afford to fix it atm so I might fallback to using the rpi 4 and am curious as to what I can expect
[00:09:43] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> At least the "I design my site, an play with values" usecase would be more pleasant
[00:14:20] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> But I'll play with different possibilities

[00:15:40] <FromDiscord> <sheerluck> May I `import fusion/matching` or is it forbidden for me? ðŸ˜¦  â†µ`Error: cannot open file: fusion/matching`
[00:18:38] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> do you have it installed?
[00:18:58] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> fusion has to be installed like a separate package, it is not bundle with nim
[00:25:58] <FromDiscord> <sheerluck> Thank you
[00:34:02] <FromDiscord> <unsafe> is this a bug or I'm doing something wrong? windows 10, fresh install, nim works fine but nimble doesn't https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/371759389889003532/879455960681287740/unknown.png
[00:36:04] <FromDiscord> <5271> helo
[00:36:22] <FromDiscord> <5271> i have one quite dumb questionâ†µhow do i update nim to a never version? <w>
[00:36:58] <FromDiscord> <unsafe> nimble update stable, i guess
[00:37:05] <FromDiscord> <unsafe> or no choosenim update stable
[00:39:42] <FromDiscord> <5271> uhhâ†µwhen i type nimble update stable it tells me `Error: Package list with the specified name not found.`
[00:40:55] <FromDiscord> <unsafe> choosenim should be right
[00:41:03] <FromDiscord> <unsafe> nimble was my mistake ;-D
[00:41:10] <FromDiscord> <5271> hmmâ†µokay
