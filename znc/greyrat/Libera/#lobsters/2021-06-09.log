[01:44:17] <wink> we have artisanal handcrafted slow search

[01:45:22] <greyrat> I think if you reach out to Algolia, they might give the site a free plan
[01:45:36] <greyrat> It works as free advertisement for them, too, after all
[01:51:36] <greyrat> wink: The default search is very weird, too. I tried =hyperbole emacs=, and the results don't include hyperbole at all. Same for ="hyperbole" emacs=.

[01:54:14] <manicennui> Clearly lobsters needs a robust solution including kafka, spark, and several other cool things.
[01:55:58] <indigo> Yeah, we need to make the entire architecture event-driven
[01:57:06] <pushcx> contentious threads are already event-driven
[01:57:32] <indigo> LOL, good one
[01:59:28] <indigo> Back at my last company, there were some folks very obsessed with event streams. Eg. write everything to an event log and then derive tables from it
[02:00:22] <ignaloidas> event logs are good if you don't need to go through all of them to gather the data you most often need
[02:00:43] <ignaloidas> e.g. with git you don't need to go through history to checkout a commit
[02:00:58] <ignaloidas> but so many event log systems fail to do this
[02:01:26] <indigo> This was for something similar to e-commerce

[07:38:12] <rtpg> dealing with moving over to terraform and I feel like I'm going insane
[07:39:11] <rtpg> like heroku 10 years ago had the "ok you push up a thing and now that thing can get a new version and be out there" and here it's like "well OK so first you do a bunch of variable template swapping and then you apply all infrastructure changes. Updating a version of a program is at the same layer of abstraction as changing your machine topology"
[07:40:09] <rtpg> excited about at least making it easier to spin up tiny processes etc but also feel like we could have smoother things that more align with like.... "normal" web apps (that don't require 50 microsevervices to run)
[07:41:26] <hoistbypetard> cleaning up my tabs... that awesome C list people were dunking on earlier has a web section and doesn't even include BCHS ( https://learnbchs.org/ ).
[07:41:27] <mockturtle> [ BCHS stack ] - learnbchs.org
[07:41:28] <hoistbypetard> That seems wrong
[07:41:50] <brennen> i haven't used terraform but i get the feeling that when i do it will pretty much be the same tissue of hilarious lies that everything else i'm supposed to be enthusiastic about is.
[07:44:09] <rtpg> I think a lot of these tools are interesting in expanding the scope of what you can configure up with "just" some code (vs futzing around with ops stuff that ends up being too hard to deploy cleanly), but I've always been a bit underwhelmed when it comes to supporting normal continuous deployment of a "boring" app
[07:44:52] <rtpg> not to mention that loads of this stuff is accretive, so you're at layers and layers of "stuff"

[14:10:39] <iDrougge> Rob Pike, wasn't he heavily involved in UTF-8?
[14:11:42] <quanticle> I think so, which is all the more irony.
[14:12:57] <iDrougge> Someone once asked K&R (I think) why they chose to use { } for blocks instead of the traditional begin/end. They said that they had just received new terminals with { } keys.
[14:14:04] <iDrougge> If they had employed the "code should be ASCII" line of thought back then, C would use stropping.
[14:15:25] <flareon> quanticle: Are you are making a factual claim? This is not a retort, I am genuinely interested in the community and the beliefs.
[14:15:27] <pja> stropping?
[14:15:32] <quanticle> Yeah, which is why C still supports ??< and ??> as alternatives to { and }
[14:16:11] <pja> Hasnâ€™t C dropped trigraphs in the latest version?
[14:16:20] <quanticle> flareon: No, I'm making a claim based upon my perception of the Go attitude towards other "complicated" things, most notably exceptions.
[14:16:38] <quanticle> pja: Has it? I know they were supported as of C99
[14:16:47] <quanticle> But maybe they're gone in newer versions.
[14:17:00] <pja> Maybe that was C++ ?
[14:17:22] <flareon> quanticle: I see. I agree. Have you looked at the site `https://cat-v.org/`?
[14:17:48] <quanticle> I am very familiar, yes.
[14:18:46] <iDrougge> Back to good old 1971.
[14:19:09] <iDrougge> pja: It still has digraphs like !=
[14:19:42] * pja checks
[14:19:49] <pja> Ah, C++ dropped them in C++17
[14:20:02] <pja> They still exist in C, plus bonus digraphs in C99!
[14:20:06] <iDrougge> I know IBM protested in the C++ committe against removing trigraphs since EBCDIC doesn't contain the entire C++ character set.
[14:20:34] <flareon> quanticle: Is there a real group of programmers who are followers of the *school* of Rob Pike and who are also vehemently right libertarian bordering on anarcho-capitalist and who also hate GNU as an abomination?
[14:20:41] <iDrougge> pja: Stropping can be things like .if. to separate the keyword if from the variable if.
[14:20:44] <ignaloidas> go has a lot of magic that it refuses to allow programmers to use
[14:20:49] <quanticle> I mean, I understand what Go is trying to do: it's trying to be a programming language that doesn't have any features that a particularly clever fresh-out-of-university 21 year old could use to write unmaintainable code. The reason it's like that is because Google is chock full of clever fresh-out-of-university 21 year-olds who like to write unmaintainable code. So yeah, if that's your problem,
[14:20:51] <quanticle> then great, definitely use Go. However, I submit that that is not a problem that many outside of FAANG actually have.
[14:20:53] <iDrougge> Or you can write .eq. instead of =
[14:21:35] <iDrougge> quanticle: I also wonder why they bother to select only smart candidates if they lock them into a padded room language.
[14:21:46] <pja> iDrougge: modern C++ has a bunch of digraphs for those exceptions IIRC.
[14:22:39] <flareon> quanticle: Note that that is not a rhetorical question.
[14:23:14] <iDrougge> pja: Perfect, then people can go on writing their C++ code in XEDIT.
[14:24:03] <ignaloidas> iDrougge, they only choose smart in algorythms candidates, and I can say from experience that competitive programming doesn't make you ready for making good software
[14:24:10] <quanticle> flareon: Uh... honestly, I don't know, but my prior is no. There aren't *that* many right-libertarian programmers to begin with, and once you add the "follower of the school of Rob Pike" and "hate GNU as an abomination" filters... I'd be surprised if you got anything more than an empty set.

[14:25:32] <ignaloidas> iDrougge, yes, because that's not what they learnt
[14:25:59] <quanticle> iDrougge: It really is a mystery, but here's my hypothesis, based upon absolutely nothing at all. *Most* companies solve this problem (i.e. too clever code) with tooling and IDEs. Google, however, having access to some bona-fide language designers, decided to solve it with a new programming language.
[14:26:06] <flareon> quanticle: I see. I am sure the creators of the site `https://cat-v.org/` would qualify. I have just described them. I was just curious if it is more deep than just some historical websites.
[14:27:32] <iDrougge> I think those hate GNU just because it's "bloat", not out of any political motivations.
[14:29:04] <kline> suckless is just performance art about software development principles
[14:29:09] <kline> not actual software to use day to day
[14:29:20] <iDrougge> ðŸ˜†

[14:29:46] <dkmueller> flareon: That makes you a performance artist
[14:30:04] <ignaloidas> ah, yes, urbit, the operating system based on a language harder to use than brainfuck
[14:30:17] <flareon> dkmueller: It's not a performance. I just find it convenient. I am not smarter to try to use it.
[14:30:26] <iDrougge> I use GNU software, not because I like Stallman or because I like the software. It's just necessary sometimes.
[14:30:33] <kline> you are probably worse off for it, though, flareon
[14:30:44] <flareon> kline: Care to elaborate?
[14:31:25] <kline> suckless tools usually lack useful features and expect you to get them as 3rd party patches, rather than rolling them in
[14:31:31] <quanticle> I mean, my main objection to GNU/Linux isn't really ideological, it's that with things like dbus and systemd, GNU/Linux is making a mockery of POSIX.
[14:31:46] <flareon> iDrougge: I am just interested in knowing is there a community which encompasses a nebula of views which starts from "GNU bad" to "Milton Freedman god" to paradoxically "Nazi style torch marches".
[14:31:52] <quanticle> We're rapidly approaching an era where there is no more "Unix" software; there's just "Linux" software.
[14:32:06] <flareon> kline: It's a personal taste.
[14:32:19] <kline> in practice i suspec that non-trivial amounts of any productivity earnings you make using suckless are lost dealing with recompilation for configuration changes, hunting down and adding useful patches, or eroded by not having features that arent available but ought to be at all
[14:32:37] <flareon> kline: I am running `dwm` and `st` with maybe two very simple patches.
[14:32:38] <iDrougge> flareon: Wasn't the torch march thing just a regular torch march?
[14:32:57] <ignaloidas> quanticle, the bad part about things like dbus and systemd is that they are not integrated in the kernel
[14:32:58] <flareon> iDrougge: I don't know. It might be.
[14:33:08] <ignaloidas> Unix is an outdated concept
[14:33:14] <quanticle> I don't know; one of my friends uses dwm. As a piece of software it seems fine. No worse than any of the other ultra-minimalist tiling window managers, like i3, for example.
[14:33:14] <iDrougge> Oh yes.
[14:33:23] <kline> yeah, i think slavish obsession with posix is probably unhelpful

[14:33:37] <kline> systemd isnt inherently bad, even if its badly developed
[14:33:59] <kline> once poettering gets bored and finds a new toy itll mostly stop being controversial
[14:34:00] <iDrougge> It's not as if the POSIX committe set out to design a useful operating system in any way.
[14:34:16] <flareon> I think if I was unable to do something I would use other software. Nobody uses suckless as a suite, though. I am currently using `irssi` to chat.
[14:34:27] <quanticle> It's not inherently bad; but it is *Linux* specific, and as more and more software ends up assuming that systemd is there and relying on it, it makes that software more and more difficult to port to BSD, for example.
[14:34:31] <ignaloidas> the X in POSIX is there just to be cool
[14:34:44] <ignaloidas> yes, very useful operating system
[14:34:56] <rbasak> POSIX has always been catching up, hasn't it? New features get implemented non-POSIX first, and then POSIX catches up.
[14:34:57] <dkmueller> suckless tools are fine usability wise imo, but I really dislike the latent elitism and gatekeeping. If you make it harder to actually understand computers it's the wrong direction. I am able to run 'make install' but I'll take a config.json over it any day.
[14:34:58] <iDrougge> There is no POSIX standard for solving dbus and systemd problems, so they must be solved individually, just like before POSIX.
[14:35:02] <kline> quanticle, id rather good software that was linux only that compromised software that i can run everywhere
[14:35:13] <kline> s/that/than
[14:35:19] <quanticle> Look, all I'm saying is that it's kind of ironic for Linux advocates to complain about "embrace, extend, extinguish" and then... uh... do just that.
[14:35:35] <rbasak> It's not like rigidly implementing only what's in POSIX has ever been the way to make progress.
[14:35:51] <flareon> dkmueller: There is elitism and it probably is the worst part of the community. But it should not be like that. I just have an unhealthy obsession with superficial design, that's why I use minimal tools.
[14:36:34] <iDrougge> But they're not designed, just like POSIX.
[14:36:38] <flareon> dkmueller: Most who use suckless tools are teenagers new to Unix, etc.
[14:36:54] <rbasak> So to me, that argument sounds like "I don't want Linux to move on because then my alternative will fall behind".
[14:37:00] <flareon> dkmueller: I am sure you have heard of `https://reddit.com/r/unixporn`.
[14:37:30] <quanticle> I guess what I'm trying to say is that it makes me sad that pretty soon we'll be down to a three OS monoculture. Windows, Linux and MacOS. Yes, we're de-facto there already, but that's not a reason to continue down the road.

[14:38:00] <iDrougge> A multiculture of POSIX implementations is also a monoculture.
[14:38:30] <ignaloidas> having three different kernels that do the same thing isn't interesting
[14:38:43] <dkmueller> flareon: That sub did cost me a lot of time. If I lurk there too much, I find myself in the middle of the next Arch install :D I agree on the other points, though. suckless isn't bad software, I just disagree with some principles
[14:39:00] <quanticle> I mean, in a sense, *all* kernels do the same thing: process launching, memory management and hardware access
[14:39:05] <iDrougge> flareon: Elitism is certainly a part in the suckless esprit de corps. Not a nice kind of elitism either.

[14:41:56] <iDrougge> quanticle: The kernel distinction is mainly interesting if you're a Unix hacker.
[14:42:00] <quanticle> Yeah, I guess the problem is that software assumes that Linux = Unix
[14:42:07] <quanticle> iDrougge: Which I am
[14:42:13] <quanticle> So what's your point?
[14:42:37] <iDrougge> The traditional Unix design puts a lot into the kernel that is somewhere else in other systems.
[14:43:00] <iDrougge> So they ascribe a certain weight to the "kernel".
[14:43:47] <quanticle> What other systems are you talking about?
[14:44:02] <quanticle> It's not as if Windows' kernel is especially "lightweight"
[14:44:55] <iDrougge> It absolutely doesn't matter what systems I'm talking about. Windows and Linux and BSD and OSX are less than 1 % of systems made.

[14:53:17] <rwb> we talk to an external service that does the 3D secure w.e. stuff

[21:04:47] <iDrougge> And this is why COBOL is still being used.

[21:05:41] <ngoldbaum> yeah there are plenty of fixed point library
[21:06:14] <ngoldbaum> iDrougge: sure thatâ€™s what CPUs have hardware support for, it would be incorrect to use fixed point numbers for lots of finance calculations
[21:06:33] <iDrougge> For some reason, they're always a library, and many libraries don't let you do simple arithmetics with numeric types that aren't part of the compiler itself.
[21:06:46] <edk> i think doing them in decimal is usually considered canonical
[21:07:21] <manicennui> There are uses of BigDecimal sprinkled through our code in cases where people realized that floats were wrong.
[21:07:22] <iDrougge> To my unmathematical brain, that sounds less error-prone than floating point.

[22:31:09] <pe> Accidentally clicked.
[22:31:10] <fro> really wish people would stop posting twitter links
[22:31:17] <fro> but then also that people would stop using twitter like that
[22:31:25] <fro> never gonna happen tho
[22:31:34] <fro> so here we are
[22:31:39] <technomancy> I haven't gotten around to it but on my todo is a irc-client-level filter for twitter links
[22:32:00] <fro> tbf not everywhere from twitter is bad
[22:32:01] <fro> i just
[22:32:09] <fro> i don't want to read a goddamn article on there
[22:32:15] <fro> in like 10 posts or whatever
[22:32:32] <technomancy> well like their client is pure horseshit
[22:32:33] <fro> everything*
[22:32:37] <fro> oh yeah
[22:32:45] <fro> i mean i don't even use twitter
[22:32:53] <technomancy> it takes like 30 seconds to load a page on my mobile device, and even then there's only like a 70% chance it will even succeed to load
[22:32:57] <fro> but i find myself reading stuff from there a lot
[22:33:06] <fro> because it doesn't require me to log in to read it
[22:33:09] <fro> mostly
[22:33:37] <fro> unlike when someone posts a fb link
[22:33:45] <technomancy> you can fix that part with nitter but then you're still like ... reading content on a site designed to make people angry
[22:33:46] <fro> which i can't read at all usually because it wants me to log in
[22:33:56] <fro> haha

[22:36:51] <fro> i was gonna look at it
[22:37:31] <kori> yeah sorry about the twitter link
[22:37:33] <kori> but still
[22:37:42] <kori> their capability to screw up is IMPRESSIVE.
[22:37:48] <kori> (I removed the story)
[22:38:01] <fro> i mean i don't care what they do

[22:38:28] <fro> oh hrm

[22:38:42] <kori> tl;dr services went down, the nicks are not RESV'd, someone /nick NickServ
[22:38:49] <kori> the security implications are obvious and Bad
[22:38:55] <technomancy> bahaha awesoem
[22:39:09] <kori> to fix it, an oper created a bot with the NickServ nick. great fix.

[22:49:22] <imode> what happened to freenode.
[22:49:52] <imode> oh my god lmao
[22:50:06] <riv> https://gist.github.com/hrefhref/a137f2b6dd63a6e2121a2c548591674c#2021---what-happened here is a quick rundown
[22:50:07] <mockturtle> [ fleenode-wip.md ] - gist.github.com
[22:50:14] <imode> that is awesome. so all those wonderful reconnecting clients just sent their shit to an unknown entity.
[22:50:28] <imode> because I guarantee you some traffic wasn't SASL.
[22:50:58] <imode> someone nick'd nickserv.. my sides.
[22:51:03] <fro> i mean it's not unknown if it's an oper
[22:51:06] <fro> still dumb tho
[22:51:24] <imode> the opers are malicious entities.
[22:55:43] <fro> well if you user their servers and services you get what you get
[22:56:32] <fro> i wouldn't trust the people here either or anywhere else for that matter
[22:57:59] <imode> I have a loose amount of trust in libera. everything they've said is.. correct.
[22:58:49] <ngoldbaum> they seem to at least be competent
[22:59:20] <fro> sure until they do something you don't like later
[23:00:11] <ngoldbaum> https://i.imgur.com/3Afv4Ur.png
[23:01:39] <riv> there are a few things abut libera that are annoying
[23:01:43] <riv> the # vs ## policy for one
[23:02:03] <fro> i didn't read it
[23:02:06] <fro> tl;dr?
[23:03:11] <kiedtl> how's that annoying though?
[23:03:21] <imode> fro: opinions can change over time you know.
[23:03:28] <fro> yep
[23:03:53] <imode> that's on the same level as "man if your buddy stabs you you probably won't like him". like yeah you're right. water is also wet. :P
[23:04:13] <fro> not exactly what i was saying but sure
[23:04:35] <fro> close enough

[23:12:27] <fro> i'm not a fan of services

[23:12:51] <fro> when you're in a place that has them
[23:12:56] <fro> that's what you gotta do

[23:13:08] <Teckla> EFNet has few services, and has turned into a cesspool if garbage
[23:13:16] <fro> i don't agree with that
[23:13:23] <Teckla> s/if garbage/of garbage/
[23:13:27] <pe> IRCnet has no services and it's... IRCnet.
[23:13:35] <fro> efnet is fine
[23:13:49] <Teckla> pe: I wonder, then, how IRCnet avoided EFNet's fate
[23:14:00] <pe> Actually there are some services on IRCnet, though not Atheme-like services.
[23:14:08] <fro> efnet only has chanfix
[23:14:14] <Teckla> I connected to EFNet a few days ago, the server chosen started by displaying an ASCII image of goatse.
[23:14:26] <fro> and?
[23:14:30] <Teckla> ...and that's just the first thing that happened.  EFNet is garbage.
[23:14:33] <fro> use another server then
[23:14:35] <pe> :D
[23:14:50] <Teckla> fro: No thanks, EFNet is all yours.
[23:14:57] <fro> cool i'll take it
[23:15:08] <Teckla> OK.
[23:15:15] <fro> i'm using that server rn
[23:15:53] <iDrougge> I miss mockturtle's s/x/y parsing.
[23:15:55] <pe> Don't stare at the goatse, for Chirst's sake.
[23:16:19] <fro> i have stared into it many times
[23:16:51] <fro> the real deal and the ascii alike
[23:17:07] <fro> honestly not even the worst thing i've seen from irc
[23:17:13] <Teckla> My experience on EFNet went downhill after that.
