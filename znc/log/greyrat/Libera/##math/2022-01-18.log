[06:08:14] <PlanckWalk> Instead of P(n) defined as "S_n < 2^n", it's easier with the strong form P(n) = "S_k < 2^k for all k <= n"
[06:08:23] <tusko> obviously I'm trying to use the IH that S_k = S_(k-1) + S_(k-2) + S_(k-3) < 2^k to prove S_(k+1) = S_(k) + S_(k-1) + S_(k-2) < 2*2^k I'm just struggling to see how to do that
[06:09:05] <tusko> ok, when you say stronger you mean it says more or are you implying strong induction?
[06:09:38] <PlanckWalk> "Strong induction" is just ordinary induction with a particular form of hypothesis
[06:09:56] <PlanckWalk> Not a different thing, just a particular example of thing.
[06:10:26] <PlanckWalk> In this case the inductive hypothesis is "stronger" in that it makes a stronger claim.
[06:11:07] <tusko> Is that right? "s_k < 2^k for all k<=n"? n seems ambiguous somehow
[06:11:11] <PlanckWalk> It claims that yes, S_n < 2^n but also that S_(n-1) < 2^(n-1) and so on.
[06:11:25] <PlanckWalk> n is the inductive variable.
[06:11:49] <PlanckWalk> P(n) = "S_k < 2^k for all k <= n"
[06:12:38] <PlanckWalk> A hypothesis of this form is sometimes called "strong induction", but it's really just induction.

[06:54:14] <PlanckWalk> Though they are somewhat related.
[06:55:12] <PlanckWalk> In fact it would work even if some of the terms did have differences greater than between successive values of 2^n
[06:57:37] <PlanckWalk> E.g. if the terms started with  1, -10000, 1 instead of 1,1,1.
[06:59:45] <tusko> I guess I just don't get it then
[07:00:49] <tusko> It does happen to be the case that each term S_k < 2^k for all k<=n by hypothesis. This is easy to show for P(1), P(2), P(3), and P(4).
[07:02:01] <tusko> So then P(k+1) says S_(k) + S_(k-1) + S_(k-2) < 2^(k+1)
[07:02:30] <tusko> or S_(k) + S_(k-1) + S_(k-2) < 2*2^(k)
[07:03:08] <tusko> ok, and then all three of those terms are less that 2^(k)
[07:03:37] <PlanckWalk> You have tighter bounds for the previosu terms
[07:03:38] <tusko> so maybe that means its obvious(tm) that their sum is less than 2*2^k
[07:03:51] <tusko> yes, of course
[07:04:02] <PlanckWalk> So why are you making them uselessly loose?
[07:04:10] <tusko> I'm not very smart
[07:04:30] <PlanckWalk> S_(k) + S_(k-1) + S_(k-2) < 2^k + 2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2)
[07:04:40] <tusko> ahhh

[07:05:06] <tusko> yes, that is a true statement

[07:06:45] <tusko> that's an interesting proof
[07:06:55] <tusko> thank you for helping me to see that
[07:07:03] <PlanckWalk> Glad I could help :)
[07:08:27] <drazak> for k > 2 anyway :)
[07:08:45] <tusko> Do you think I should do something to prove 2^k + 2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2) < 2^(k+1) or is that obvious?
[07:09:00] <PlanckWalk> It's fairly obvious, but you can make it more explicit
[07:09:37] <PlanckWalk> 2^k + 2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2) < 2^k + 2^(k-1) + 2^(k-1) = 2^k + 2 * 2^(k-1) = 2^k + 2^k = 2^(k+1)  for example

[07:31:34] <isekaijin> Hello. Today I don't really want to do mathematics, so let's talk about abstract algebra. Consider pairs (R, S), where R is a ring and S is a submonoid of its group of units. However, I don't really want to say âgroup of unitsâ, so I'm going to axiomatize it differently.
[07:32:44] <isekaijin> We have an injective monoid homomorphism from S to (R, *) and we have an operation r/s (with r \in R and s \in S) such that (rs)/s = (r/s)s = r.
[07:33:03] <isekaijin> Notice that S does NOT have to be the whole group of units of R.
[07:33:13] *** Quits: XCode (~XCode@d108-173-59-218.abhsia.telus.net) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[07:34:29] <isekaijin> The point to doing this is to avoid defining the group of units as a subset of R. Subsets of a type are problematic when you try to implement them on a computer.
[07:35:51] <isekaijin> Instead we require the user to specify the elements that they want to consider invertible.
[07:36:43] <isekaijin> Are there use cases for this kind of thing? Could anything good come out of potentially willfully ignoring that some invertible elements of a ring are, in fact, invertible?
[07:36:46] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[07:37:48] <isekaijin> My intuition for invertible elements is that they are the nowhere vanishing functions on Spec(R).
[07:38:34] *** Joins: XCode (~XCode@d108-173-59-218.abhsia.telus.net)
[07:40:56] <isekaijin> If instead we have to explicitly specify S as above, then we are basically saying that we can't deduce which functions are nowhere vanishing from R alone.
[07:43:17] <isekaijin> (This is less crazy than it might seem to a classical mathematician. The group of units of R might not be be a subset with decidable membership.)

[19:58:45] <Z-module> cadmio: Just show that:  (1) any ideal containing S has all of those elements; and (2) the set of all those elements *is* an ideal containing S.
[19:58:49] <isekaijin> Xardas: For example, x^2 + x + 1 is a real polynomial, but its roots are complex.
[19:58:59] <cadmio> the fact that you've the unity 1 allows you to write say if r_1 = 1 then you've 1*a_1 + r_2*a_2 _ ...
[19:59:28] <Xardas> x^2 +1Â  too !! :D
[19:59:32] <isekaijin> Yeah.
[19:59:32] <Xardas> hahaha
[19:59:32] <cadmio> how can I have the elements a_1, a_2, ... a_m
[19:59:34] <Z-module> cadmio, yes, if R lacks 1, then that set might not contain all of S or even any single thing in S
[19:59:48] <Xardas> that's funny
[20:00:29] <riv> let alpha be the roots of the poly, form Delta = (alpha_1 - alpha_2)(alpha_1 - alpha_3)...(alpha_2 - alpha_3)...(alpha_{n-1} - alpha_n), this is the discriminant

[20:02:14] <isekaijin> But I wanted to avoid mentioning the roots that aren't guaranteed to exist in the ground field.
[20:02:32] <isekaijin> Surely we can give an intrinsic definition that doesn't require âstepping outside of the ground fieldâ.
[20:03:09] <isekaijin> cadmio: By definition, ideals are closed under linear combinations. So the ideal generated by the a_i has to contain the linear combinations you mentioned.
[20:03:24] <riv> algebraic closure always exists so i don't mind using it
[20:03:26] <isekaijin> cadmio: The only thing that you need to prove is that the set of linear combinationed you mentioned is, in fact, an ideal.
[20:04:14] <cadmio> isekaijin: it has to contain the single elements a_i as well
[20:04:26] <isekaijin> cadmio: a_i = 1a_i + 0
[20:04:39] <isekaijin> cadmio: So your linear combinations are already included.
[20:04:58] <isekaijin> ERRR
[20:05:03] <isekaijin> So your original generators are already included.

[20:06:21] <Z-module> cadmio, it's quite similar to how if S is some subset of a group G, then the subgroup <S> generated by S is the set of all finite products t_1...t_n where for each t_i, either t_i or (t_i)^-1 is in S.  A subgroup containing S *must* have all of those, and also the set of all of those *is* a subgroup.
[20:06:29] <Z-module> That's what "generated by" means.
[20:07:28] <Z-module> Also, what isekaijin said. There are some slightly amusing things about rings without 1, but mostly no one ever uses such things.
[20:08:53] <isekaijin> I have run into exactly one ring without unit that is useful - Schwartz space.
[20:09:00] <Z-module> I guess the only slightly meritorious candidate for one is the rng (means ring without 1) of all continuous real functions f on [0,1] with f(0) = f(1) = 0.
[20:09:14] <isekaijin> Okay, I have run into two.
[20:09:31] <cadmio> the sum goes from 1 to m so if r_1 = 1 if you take the term a_m = r_m a_m now r_m is not 1 because r_1 = 1

[20:30:01] <cadmio> isekaijin: if the ring contains a unit you don't need the linear combination with natural numbers

[20:30:16] <laurus> Z-module: What I used to do is get a syllabus for a course that used the book, and then follow that, that's what I did for that Goldberg Analysis book and it worked really well, some of the problems were really necessary for later work
[20:30:21] <isekaijin> cadmio: The natural numbers serve as the indices.

[20:31:00] <isekaijin> cadmio: Linear combinations are sums of finite but arbitrary size, so the first thing you need to choose is the number of summands.

[20:34:52] <cadmio> if you set one to 0 like you said earlier one in the example "a_i = 1a_i + 0" so you're setting all r_i to 0

[22:01:32] <Guest1778> Can anyone help me understand this: https://i.imgur.com/zqXvXU4.png with an example? The set of real numbers R is an infinite field. Define a polynomial on the ring R[x1, x2, ..., xn]...so like f(x,y) = y - x^2. But I don't understand the rest of the proposition
[22:02:05] <Simplar> There are no ways to make our sequence to consist of even amounts of numbers because we'll always get odd number multiplied by x
[22:03:11] <Simplar> But we can make our sequence consist of odd amounts of number in the following way: x, 10x, 0.1*(10x), 10x, 0.1*(10x), ..., i.e. as 0.1*10 = 1, we get raw x on odd places.
[22:03:53] <D5n9sMatrix> #octave AÂ  =[10, 0, 10; 10, 2, 20; 10, 3, 30];Â  format bankÂ  solver A * 2 + pi
[22:04:17] <Simplar> Since we now know the sequence must consist of odd amount of numbers, we can use this to formalize the 'maximum' way.
[22:05:07] <Simplar> We must have even amount of 1x's and odd amount of 10x's in the sequence in order for it to work and give us an even number multiplied by x when summed up.
[22:05:22] <Simplar> i.e. 2y-1 tens and 2y ones
[22:05:41] <Simplar> thus, (2y-1)*10x+2y*x = 1860
[22:06:07] <Simplar> From there we can easily get to a Diophantine equation (11y-5)x = 930
[22:06:19] <Simplar> and it only has two solutions
[22:06:29] <Simplar> over positive integers, of course

[22:06:46] <Simplar> (155;1) and (1;85)
[22:07:16] <riv> Guest1778: we can look at the 1 variable version first
[22:07:17] <Simplar> We want the maximum amount of members inside the sequence, thus we take 85 for y
[22:07:52] <riv> it's saying if you have a polynomial f in R[X], then f = 0 iff f(x) is the zero function
[22:07:55] <Simplar> from there, we can get the total amount of maximum members of that sequence, evaluating 2y-1+2y = 4y-1 = 4*85-1 = 339
[22:08:05] <Guest1778> wtf

[22:09:14] <isekaijin> Let's start with the basics. A polynomial is a formal linear combination of monomials, right?
[22:09:24] <Guest1778> yeah
[22:09:40] <isekaijin> You can evaluate a polynomial as if it were a function, but a priori, there's no reason why a nonzero polynomial couldn't evaluate to the identically zero function.
[22:10:07] <isekaijin> For example, the polynomial x^p - x over the finite field Z/pZ evaluates to the identically zero function.
[22:10:28] <isekaijin> What the proposition is saying is that this doesn't happen when the ground field is infinite.
[22:11:00] <isekaijin> This is proved by induction on the number of variables, and ultimately, it boils down to the fact that polynomials have finitely many roots.
[22:11:08] <isekaijin> Errr, polynomials in one variable.
[22:11:16] <Guest1778> in 1d, I can write a polynomial like this: f(x) = x.
[22:11:36] <Guest1778> or like 2x
[22:11:40] <isekaijin> Yeah, but this polynomial doesn't evaluate to the identically zero function.
[22:12:01] <isekaijin> The only case in which 2x evaluates to the zero function is when 2 = 0 in the ground field anyway.
[22:12:07] <Guest1778> uhm
[22:13:00] <Guest1778> to my understanding, the proposition is telling me any polynomial in the ring, when we find solutions for it, must be the zero polynomial. And that doesn't make sense
[22:13:37] <Simplar> Is a polynomial x^6+x^3+1 irreducible over Q?
[22:13:53] <isekaijin> Guest1778: You're misunderstanding the proposition, then.
[22:14:04] <Guest1778> I know I am, THat's what i'm trying to fix
[22:14:11] <isekaijin> Guest1778: f = 0 doesn't just mean âthe polynomial has rootsâ.

[22:15:12] <isekaijin> Guest1778: âf = 0 in K[x1,...,xn]â means âf is the identically zero formal K-linear combination of monomialsâ.
[22:15:14] <Z-module> Simplar: yes
[22:15:38] <Simplar> Eisenstein's criterion, I guess?
[22:15:43] <Guest1778> that is very confusing
[22:16:00] <Z-module> yeah Simplar, use y = x + 1  for that
[22:16:05] <isekaijin> Mmm.
[22:16:14] <riv> Guest1778: what was confusing about what I said?
[22:16:32] <riv> you just said "wtf" and didn't elaborate
[22:16:41] <isekaijin> Guest1778: Then all that I can do is tell you that you review your basic algebra.
[22:16:41] <Z-module> sorry, y = x - 1
[22:17:07] <isekaijin> It's okay to find the proof of the proposition a little tricky or hard to come up with.
[22:17:10] <isekaijin> Guest1778: ^
[22:17:41] <isekaijin> But if you don't understand the proposition itself (not its proof), then you really need to review material from earlier algebra courses.
[22:18:41] <riv> sigh :)
[22:18:43] <Guest1778> "if you have a polynomial f in R[X], then f = 0 iff f(x) is the zero function" -- I'll write a polynomial: f(x) = 2x - 1. Then f(x) = 0 is supposed to mean that f is the zero polynomial?
[22:18:44] <Guest1778> But f(x) isn't the zero polynomial.
[22:18:51] <riv> oh i got a reply
[22:19:10] <riv> Guest1778: Are you familiar with the distinction between polynomials and functions?
[22:19:19] <riv> i.e. a polynomial is not a function, but it can be turned into one
