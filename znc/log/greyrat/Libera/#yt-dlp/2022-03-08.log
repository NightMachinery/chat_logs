[02:18:52] <malc> are MSN videos supposed to work? (for instance https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/family-remembers-shooting-victim/vp-AAUJdVz )

[03:28:49] <pabs3> malc: looks like there is MSN support but it doesn't work on that particular page, so you might need to file an issue and wait for a fix, or try to work on it yourself

[04:34:03] <BCMCCMMNX> Hello. I was wondering if anybody could tell me if yt-dlp can be swapped in for youtube-dl in Python projects. I have a program that imports youtube-dl as a library. I can't find any good information on the compatibility between youtube-dl and yt-dlp as python libraries.
[04:35:39] <pabs3> they use different import names to start with, probably there are other changes too
[04:36:38] <BCMCCMMNX> I see. I was assuming the import name would be different, which is fine. I was just wondering if I could replace the import and still use the same script without significant changes.
[04:38:00] <pabs3> I think the best way to find out is try it, maybe add a command-line switch to the script so you can use either of them
[04:38:16] <pabs3> I expect the answer is "probably" :)
[04:39:18] <BCMCCMMNX> I see. I guess I can give it a try. If I remember, the program only uses it for some ancillary functions (I am attempting to patch the program mps-youtube myself to use yt-dlp instead of ytdl due to the throttling issues of the latter).
[04:41:32] <pabs3> I see there is already a fork that does that https://github.com/mps-youtube/mps-youtube/issues/1191
[04:41:44] <BCMCCMMNX> Oh, awesome.
[04:41:45] <pabs3> https://github.com/iamtalhaasghar/yewtube/
[04:53:50] <BCMCCMMNX> All right, I'll look into this for a bit. Thanks for the help!

[12:20:58] <brianx> i've been running something like: yt-dlp -4 -s "https://www.youtube.com/c/techlinked/videos" to get a list of public videos on a channel.  what i want is just the video id like: MlmOYmcK3sc and have no problem extracting it from the above but the performance of the command is really really slow.  is there a good (fast) way to list the video ids?
[12:32:04] <brianx> for example, a channel with just 36 videos takes over a minute and a half and --write-pages uses 36MB of disk, so it's clearly pulling a whole lot more than just the list of videos for some reason.
