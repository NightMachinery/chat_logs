[00:04:27] <larsks> I mean...'docker export' does what it says: it exports your container filesystem as a tar archive. So if something was written to the filesystem, it will be included in the output of docker export.
[00:04:39] <daemon> cool ta
[00:04:41] <larsks> Volumes are seperate filesystems, so things written there will *not* be included.

[00:12:24] <PapaChub> I understand what `-i` and `-t` do, but is there a workaround to let me, e.g.  "fetch-json.sh | docker run --rm -it tui-json-viewer" (e.g., https://github.com/antonmedv/fx) ?
[00:17:43] <PapaChub> The best I've come up with is "fetch-json.sh > /tmp/fetch-json.out && docker run --rm -it -v /tmp/fetch-json.out:/tmp/fetch-json.out tui-json-viewer /tmp/fetch-json.out; rm -f /tmp/fetch-json.out" but that seems gross...  :-\
[00:18:10] <geirha> you could pass it via env if it's not too large
[00:19:32] <PapaChub> geirha, An interesting thought...  I was hoping to remap a file descriptor (>&4 or some such) and attach STDIN to /that/
[00:19:34] <geirha> or via arg for that matter
[00:20:53] <PapaChub> Things could get large...  And although I don't need it now, I'd like to keep open the option of streaming in new content (Think "tail -f" instead of "fetch-json.sh")

[00:23:03] <geirha> a tcp socket, but it'll be cumbersome to set up
[00:23:45] <PapaChub> geirha, Yah, I was considering a unix socket and/or named pipe (FIFO)
[00:24:06] <PapaChub> I was just hoping somebody had already invented that wheel!  ;-D
[00:24:42] <geirha> I think most would just grab the json from an api, possibly running in another container in the same network
[00:25:47] <PapaChub> The impetus for this was actually to inspect [see what I did there?] the output of "docker inspect myImage"
[00:28:02] <PapaChub> My container host doesn't have `fx` (and I can't install things there), so I figured I'd build an image with that as its entrypoint, and treat it like any other command-line utility
[00:32:21] <geirha> perhaps  docker run --name fx --rm -it tui-json-viewer sh -c 'mkfifo fifo && fx < fifo'  and in another:  docker inspect ... | docker exec -i fx sh -c 'cat > fifo'

[03:32:53] <rawtaz> well, the dockerfile just specifies what should be run and how the image should be built. but if the image then is built for a different arch than what you have, that is what it is

[04:04:23] <daniel-k> tang^, rawtaz: ah, makes sense then
[04:05:21] <daniel-k> So if I want to share the same docker env with someone whose on a different arch, they should just build their own image from the Dockerfile in the repo?
[04:05:50] <larsks> daniel-k: that's one way, or you can build a multi-arch image, so that people can just `docker pull` it.

[15:09:36] <velix> Sorry for this annoying question (I bet you're have it once a day). Inside a container, a user with uid=999 is created. The rootless container is running as user 1002. When uid=999 writes to the shared directory, it's belonging e.g. to user 20321 and use 1002 cannot read it. Can I remap the internal user to make it write as 1002 in the host?
[15:10:11] <velix> I'm aware of --userns-remap of course

[21:21:42] <svm_invictvs> Why do we discourage running SSH in a docker container?

[21:22:23] <dodo> svm_invictvs: why do you want to run ssh inside?
[21:22:56] <endigma> i don't think there's anything inherently wrong with ssh in a container
[21:23:22] <endigma> the issue would be that ideally a container should have the smallest exposed plane possible
[21:23:46] <endigma> if ssh is that plane then i don't see why it shouldn't be accessible, but usually docker exec will provide any shell access required
[21:23:59] <endigma> no point in slapping ssh in a webserver container
[21:24:02] <dodo> another issue is that the container becomes non-ephemeral if you touch it by hand
[21:24:22] <svm_invictvs> No, it's not for that.
[21:24:23] <dodo> and another issue is that you'd probably run more than one service inside
[21:24:35] <svm_invictvs> This container runs a shell-based admin panel.
[21:25:01] <endigma> if SSH is what you want it to use then use it
[21:25:06] <tang^> the whole point of running a container is to isolate your application from the rest of the OS
[21:25:22] <svm_invictvs> It's a container just to run this shell.
[21:25:22] <tang^> it's not a VM
[21:25:27] <endigma> tang^: i wouldn't call that the whole point
[21:25:39] <tang^> okay, fair
[21:25:49] <tang^> a main point of... 
[21:26:01] <endigma> a logically separated SSH container isn't a terrible use of docker
[21:26:07] <svm_invictvs> Yeah, exactly
[21:26:10] <svm_invictvs> It's jsut to do that.
[21:26:31] <svm_invictvs> And I"m configuring it to run a custom shell that is just for doing admin tasks with the app.
[21:26:36] <dodo> if you know what you're doing, just go for it
[21:26:39] <endigma> sometimes I use docker just to avoid having to install stuff on my os
[21:26:55] <svm_invictvs> endigma, That's a pretty valid use case too. Isolating configuration
[21:26:56] <tang^> but does that admin panel need to be running when you're not using it?
[21:27:17] <tang^> if the answer is no, then you run your image interactively
[21:27:54] <svm_invictvs> tang^, Well. One of the things it does is that it lets and admin in to forcibly reset the web-admin password fi somebody forgets it rather.
[21:28:26] <tang^> sure, but does the panel need to be running 24/7 in order for that to work?
[21:28:40] <svm_invictvs> Probably not
[21:28:56] <bonhoeffer> what is a good alternate port for ssh?
[21:29:06] <tang^> just running the image interactively might work in that use case, then
