[05:54:02] <kimjetwav> Mmmmm. I'd like to say yes and point you to it, but the reality is I just read the README and did it myself.
[05:55:03] <kimjetwav> Basically you bootstrap it by sticking a bit of code in your early-init which evaluates the git raws from the upstream repo, after that it effectively package-manager its own updates.
[05:56:03] <kimjetwav> M-x straight-use-package asks you what you'd like to install from elpa, melpa, and other places. You can also write simple recipe expressions that allow it to get from other places.

[08:35:28] <lk251> I'm trying to rescue a 3D model of a Strike Eagle from a 1992 simulator which inspired me to study aerospace engineering... the 3D model is in a "variable-length, NUL-terminated (ASCIIZ)" file. Any ideas how to go about this? Should I start by finding a way to open this on emacs?
[08:36:21] <mattf> what is this emacs
[08:36:43] <lk251> emacs is an operating system containing an editor
[08:36:45] <bpalmer> lk251: you could try just opening it up in emacs and seeing how it does
[08:36:56] <lk251> bpalmer: thanks! let's see...
[08:36:57] <mattf> what i mean is, what?? is this #emacs
[08:37:09] <lk251> yes mattf this is #emacs
[08:37:13] <bpalmer> lk251: I suspect that the only possible issue is the nul-terminator won't be preserved when/if you save it.
[08:37:22] <mattf> i didn't know emacs could open 3D stuff
[08:37:37] <mattf> is there something like blender for emacs but not openscad 
[08:37:46] <ajak> 3d stuff is just files, really
[08:37:48] <ajak> emacs opens files
[08:37:50] <lk251> mattf: My apologies, I wasn't clear - I'm trying to extract the 3D modeling data, which I will have to then convert to some godly format
[08:37:51] <mattf> i mean
[08:37:55] <mattf> ediditing
[08:37:58] <mattf> with easy
[08:38:03] <mattf> Oh
[08:38:11] <bpalmer> "{x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}" is an ascii representation of a 3d vector , maybe.
[08:38:24] <bpalmer> so the file might just contain something like a bunch of those.
[08:38:28] <lk251> I'm assuming I will have a list of vertices in 3 dimensional space, I'll put them in an ikea bag and run for my life into some friendlier data format
[08:39:06] <lk251> bpalmer: this is the file spec http://strikeeagleeye.sourceforge.net/doc/html/#f15FileMain3dxFileNames
[08:39:11] <mattf> why dont you write a small python script...
[08:39:33] <lk251> These are docs for the tools used to make the game, including file specification, byte per byte
[08:39:54] <lk251> ajak: exactly! and this is archaeology, and the 3d model is like 30 kb :D
[08:39:57] <bpalmer> good ol' low-level format specs.
[08:40:02] <lk251> yes i love this :D
[08:40:06] <lk251> its kind of fun

[14:43:25] <fsbot`> Highly likely!
[14:43:50] <vlatko> Ok, that's great.
[14:43:57] <wasamasa> uh, do not edit emacs sources
[14:44:04] <vlatko> Now I just need to figure out where did Emacs conjure that function from.
[14:44:12] <vlatko> wasamasa: why not?
[14:44:14] <wasamasa> it's a really bad idea
[14:44:23] <vlatko> I need to put a breakpoint in there for debugging.
[14:44:31] <wasamasa> besides, edebug will only work with manual instrumentation
[14:44:50] <wasamasa> so you'll either have to use (debug) or printf-debugging

[14:45:13] <wasamasa> correct, it will only have an effect after C-u C-M-x 
[14:45:35] <vlatko> wasamasa: can you now just help me figure out how did Emacs conjure that function after I've commented it out...
[14:45:50] <wasamasa> the reason why editing the files is a bad idea is because it doesn't work the way you'd expect it and 98% of the debugging needs are served just fine with doing interactive debugging
[14:46:03] <wasamasa> if you hit the remaining 2%, dunno, maybe you have to rebuild emacs from source :P
[14:46:53] <vlatko> wasamasa: how would you debug this case: when I have (save-desktop-mode 1) I get a 'The local variables list in blahblah contains values that may not be safe'.
[14:47:20] <vlatko> But without the (save-desktop-mode 1) I do not get it even after I open a c++ file from a a project that contains .dir-locals.el

[14:49:02] <fsbot`> It is certain!
[14:49:06] <wasamasa> yeah, looking at desktop.el it uses `after-init-hook'
[14:49:14] <wasamasa> so if you do things before that hook, you'll be fine

[17:05:10] <rnkn> kilobug: you have drunk the RMS koolaid on what freedom means

[17:05:40] <pjb> rnkn: there's a reason it's called copyleft.
[17:05:48] <kilobug> rnkn: that's basic philosophy and politics, freedom is not the right to do whatever you want, freedom is the right to do whatever you want _as long as it doesn't harm someone or deprive someone of a right/freedom_
[17:05:52] <rpav> selling your 1000 lines under a restrictive, non-source license

[17:07:13] <rpav> by advocating against some license merely on this fact, you are
[17:07:16] <rnkn> just pointing out how easy it is to take down the entire GPL argument
[17:07:34] <rpav> except your perception of "take down" is not nearly as watertight as you think
[17:07:47] <rnkn> as in, if it were a good argument, one sentence shouldn't blow it apart
[17:07:53] <kilobug> rnkn: only if you completely disregard all of philosophy and politics and just use the word "free" when it utterly doesn't apply
[17:07:54] <rpav> nor does it
[17:08:16] <pjb> rnkn: indeed.  One of the "easiest" way, is to benefit from the network effect to distribute competing privative software. Eg. Apple distributes iOS, and so many people use it, that GNU/Linux becomes irrelevant.
[17:08:46] <rnkn> sometimes I realy wanna pull out that I have a double degree in philosophy, but that's cool
[17:09:00] <rpav> MS's embrace-extend-extinguish is proof enough that "make some modifications and proprietary distribution" _definitely_ has an effect on "your 1000 lines"
[17:09:20] <rnkn> how?
[17:09:27] <rpav> you must be young heh
[17:09:37] <pjb> rnkn: another trivial way, is to make it so daunting or difficult to build from source.  Eg. Google distributes the sources of the Android system, but you need specialised programmers to get them, compile them and install them, even without counting the TEE and code signature problems.
[17:09:47] <pjb> ie. the end user is totally fucked. 
[17:09:51] <rnkn> uh huh
[17:09:59] <pjb> One thing for the GPL, is that at least it has some consideration for the end user.
[17:10:34] <pjb> The arguments for BSD/MIT usually consider the developers, not the end users.
[17:10:53] <rnkn> rpav: rather than ad hominem attacks, you'll do better to address the argument
[17:10:56] <rpav> rnkn: because pick any of the examples of such where the proprietary modification is better-supported than your single effort, and overwhelms it, and your small code is now useless next to the well-supported proprietary behemoth
[17:11:11] <kilobug> pjb: indeed, BSD-style licenses are mostly centered on the rights of _developers_ while GPL-style license are mostly centered on the rights of _end users_, they don't aim at protecting/defending the interests of the same people

[17:27:31] <rpav> but such a statement is neither a "take down" of the GPL, nor really relevant, and has some questionable underlying assumptions (i.e., the entitlement to the work of everyone else)
[17:27:34] <rudybot> grym: but the unsexy never reproduce, so i think we should focus on being desirable, and not worry so much about survival.
[17:27:39] <rnkn> I actually quoted that in a political science essay

[17:28:37] <kilobug> rpav: no, not "entitled to all of our code", the GPL doesn't impose you to give the source code of a modification you keep for yourself; it just states that you cannot deny others of the freedom you were given, that _if_ you give someone a modified version, it should come with all the freedoms, and therefore with the source code; but no obligation to distribute at all
[17:28:42] <rnkn> there's an unfortunately truncated version floating around; you've seen the full version with the line "in life there are no true atheists"?
[17:28:49] <rpav> kilobug: yes

[17:30:02] <rnkn> a friend also gave me the book version, of which I'm sure DFW would not approve
[17:30:33] <rpav> but there's clear misunderstanding about the underlying "i'm entitled to do, publicly, whatever i want with everyone else's code" .. making modifications is really a red herring 
[17:31:01] <grym> rnkn: probably not, no.  far too glurgey even for someone who had at least a recognition that sometimes there was something there
[17:31:10] <rpav> like making modifications doesn't change anything (hur hur)
[17:32:01] <rpav> e.g., you write a proprietary compiler for your proprietary platform and no one can use some BSD code on it without paying for your vanilla compiled version
[17:32:30] <rnkn> if you like DFW, a good friend wrote an extraordinary book that I think achieves similar kinds of brilliance: http://zerogrampress.com/2020/12/27/hang-him-when-he-is-not-there/

[17:44:59] <bremner> meh. vscode is too fragile to configure for me. plugins keep breaking, and they are the only reason to use it
[17:45:10] <bremner> I mean, when the JS debugger doesn't work...
[17:45:42] <rpav> i didn't really have that issue .. bigger issue is that its plugin system is a heavy enterprisey mess .. and that every frame is like an entirely separate _thing_
[17:45:44] <bremner> so for my weird use-case of wanting a stable config for a group of people, I think I'm going to drop vscode

[20:36:09] <dale> thomasb06: Note that I'm *betting* (global-set-key (kbd "<f5>") "`, `") can be different from binding a key to a command that runs (insert) if a particular buffer has ` or , bound to something other than just self-insert-command (i.e. "insert the thing I just typed").

[20:37:08] <dale> thomasb06: For example, if you were in a mode where ` was automatically paired (ex. sh-mode perhaps?) then I believe binding the key to "`, `" would actually simulate you typing those three characters, so you might end up with this in your buffer: ``, ``
[20:37:23] <dale> thomasb06: If you instead had a command running (insert) bound, you would still just insert literally `, `
[20:37:42] <dale> At least, if I understand how macros work.

[20:39:12] <dale> thomasb06: Wait, I think I'm wrong again, I just tested it in a sh-mode buffer and ` is not being paired.  That might be down to how electric-pair-mode works.
[20:39:30] <stm> dale: you are right. If one of the characters is not bound to self-insert, if fails...
[20:39:55] <thomasb06> the named function is the good practice then

[22:50:10] <Bayes> any idea how to get all src blocks in a document to have numbered lines by default? There's the -n switch but I was hoping to toggle them on in the whole document.

[22:51:54] <Bayes> just tried that and it didn't work
[22:53:12] <Bayes> man it shouldnt be that hard
[22:53:43] <Bayes> I think the thing is that header args is meant to set header arguments but not switches ? https://org-babel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/header-args/
