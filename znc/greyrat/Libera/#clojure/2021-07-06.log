[18:24:53] *** Quits: silasfox (~sbv@xdsl-78-35-72-41.nc.de) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[18:26:06] <v3ga> so you're going the lein route?
[18:27:20] <EdwardIII> v3ga: so i started off with cljsbuild, got that working. i was following the figwheel docs (so following along with the figwheel docs, and their notes on using a custom ring-handler). i could get it compiling the main.js file to the right place, but somehow using that with my custom ring handler, it's getting 404 all the time
[18:27:27] <EdwardIII> now i'm trying the lein-figwheel plugin route
[18:28:05] <EdwardIII> v3ga: do you have a preferred way? 
[18:29:34] <v3ga> cli tools now and a deps.edn 
[18:31:05] <EdwardIII> following the lein figwheel build i run into this: https://gist.github.com/EdwardIII/5c93d7d06efe05f9c9e107bc6a0df060#file-01-out but i find the error a bit confusing as this is the only place i have output-dir configured (i've moved myapp.cljs.edn to myapp.cljs.edn.old)
[18:31:29] <v3ga> so are you able to serve a base index.html file that calls your javascript?

[18:34:54] <EdwardIII> ah i think i've just cracked what's going on with the lein plugin
[18:35:10] <v3ga> oh the first mistake :cljsbuilds, see you did :builds [ :builds ... ] 
[18:35:31] <EdwardIII> yes :)
[18:36:07] <EdwardIII> that's what's causing the error: All ClojureScript build config :output-dir parameters should be unique 
[18:41:25] <EdwardIII> hehe arg same issue as before. for some reason something somehow is returning 404 for the js file, but i can definitely see it on disk in the right place i think. i set the ring handler here: https://github.com/EdwardIII/imjur/blob/main/project.clj#L53  it's definied here: https://github.com/EdwardIII/imjur/blob/main/src/imjur/core.clj#L71
[18:42:17] <EdwardIII> i see resources/public/js/example.js on disk and that's what i point to in my html: https://github.com/EdwardIII/imjur/blob/main/resources/index.html#L8
[19:07:50] <EdwardIII> right, i figured it out. i added :target-path "target/%s" and  :resource-paths ["target/"] to make figwheel happy initially (when it was jut outputting files to ./target/public). i'm thinking that :resource-paths actually removed the real ./resources dir from being used properly
[19:07:58] <EdwardIII> which silently just made the static assets unservable

[20:38:04] <Para> Out of curiosity, when you say figwheel, do you mean the older one or Figwheel Main?
[20:40:22] <EdwardIII> Para: i'm actually not 100% sure, i wasn't able to figure that out from the plugin repo yet: https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel - i'm thinking main because theres' a dir called "figwheel-main" that just contains a file saying it's been moved to it's own repo now

[23:40:42] <EdwardIII> chujev: how could you tell?
[23:43:21] <ridcully> the new one is named figwheel-main
[23:43:45] <chujev> the readme of lein-figwheel suggests using the new figwheel-main and links to the new repo
[23:44:02] <chujev> i've been using both, now fully migrated to figwheel-main
[23:44:48] <EdwardIII> ah i did read that but i thought it was more like "check this out, this is the new version" and that it was encorporated, not a replacement'
[23:44:53] <EdwardIII> i will immediately migrate then heh
[23:45:34] <ridcully> i think i only ever used main in one recent trial.  so if you have lein-figwheel running you will have the main benefit of it
[23:47:04] <jeaye> main doesn't support some of the more complex project setups, so a migration may not make sense if you have a bunch of different builds, each sharing common bases.
[23:47:40] <EdwardIII> well this is just a toy project, so it's more to learn about how all this stuff works
[23:54:17] <EdwardIII> i'm sure the universe will go on just fine without my amazing imgur reimagining
