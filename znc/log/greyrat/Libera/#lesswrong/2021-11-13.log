[00:20:42] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, over here in finland it would be legal for the government to decide to force vaccination of everyone or some people. but they seem hesitant to do so
[00:21:10] <kuudes> basicly, already before the pandemic it was in the laws, that with a statute government can order some or all people to be vaccinated
[00:21:37] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: hm... why do newsletter tags not popup inside popups? https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/xwd-16367502172886252.png they pop up on the actual newsletter page: https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/xwd-16367502582886538.png and continue to work as normal on regular pages: https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/xwd-16367502722886615.png
[00:22:53] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, and it is legal for lawmakers in other countries to force the same, perhaps all are hesitant for the same reasons
[00:23:26] <Gurkenglas> everyone is now talking about it and so it's costlier to take a stance than years ago when it was hypothetical

[00:24:01] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, no, not everywhere
[00:24:04] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: and hm, it seems that tags in general popup inside popups: https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/xwd-16367504012886851.png so... something about the 'newsletter' tag specifically? newsletter pages?
[00:24:05] <feepbot> Norway plans third vaccine dose for all adults, "corona passes"
[00:24:19] <kuudes> often there are constitutional and human rights considerations that would need to pass
[00:24:26] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, okay *some* other countries, more when you've got a supermajoity
[00:24:34] <kuudes> the weird thing is that in finland we already have done those deliberations in 2016
[00:24:46] <kuudes> and this does not need a parliament approval even anymore
[00:24:50] <kuudes> just executive decision
[00:24:56] <Gurkenglas> whose job is that decision?
[00:25:03] <kuudes> basicly same as if biden could just order the military to hunt and vax everyone in usa
[00:25:14] <kuudes> the government cabinet's
[00:25:21] <Gurkenglas> what basis are they supposed to decide upon?
[00:25:59] <Gurkenglas> does the government cabinet decide things by majority vote?
[00:26:18] <kuudes> it is open, sort of
[00:26:22] <kuudes> https://finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2016/en20161227.pdf
[00:26:58] <kuudes> "Section 47 Compulsory vaccination: (1) Provisions on organising compulsory vaccination can be issued by Government decree, if  comprehensive vaccination is necessary to prevent the spread of a generally hazardous communicable disease  capable of causing substantial harm to the life  and health of the population or a part thereof. A compulsory vaccination may also be limited  to a certain part of the population, a group or age class. (2) A municipality 
[00:26:58] <kuudes> must arrange the compulsory vaccination referred to in sub-section 1."
[00:28:18] <Gurkenglas> do they have some basic guidelines on how to act within their constraints? according to their conscience? the good of the country? what will get them reelected?
[00:30:34] <kuudes> they are responsible to the parliament, which can fire them with a majority decision
[00:30:52] <kuudes> hmm, it is that Government issues decrees with a majority decision
[00:31:17] <Gurkenglas> are there press conferences where each member lays out their reasoning?
[00:31:36] <kuudes> sure? if they so want?
[00:31:44] <rmmh> smh all the central authorities hate crypto https://fortune.com/2021/11/11/muslims-trade-crypto-indonesia-sharia-compliance-haram-ulema-council-bitcoin-shiba-inu/
[00:31:55] <feepbot> Muslims can't trade crypto, says the head of Sharia compliance in the world's largest Islamic country | Fortune (Cryptocurrencies don’t follow Sharia tennets and should not be used by Muslims, Indonesia’s National Religious Council said)
[00:32:31] <Gurkenglas> "elements of uncertainty, wagering, and harm" are loans haram?
[00:32:38] <gwern> oh yes
[00:32:53] <gwern> in fact, sharia finance is all about figuring out how to disguise loans as anything else
[00:33:31] <gwern> the really puzling thing here is how gold can be the gold standard of sharia finance, but cryptocurrency fail because 'has elements of uncertainty, wagering, and harm'
[00:33:33] <Gurkenglas> well then the article is just "cryptocurrency is haram. because banks are"
[00:33:50] <rmmh> turns out it's hard to operate modern banking without interest
[00:34:02] <gwern> (like, gold investment has no element of uncertainty? there's no element of wagering in holding gold? there's no harm to gold mining or processing or the industry?)
[00:34:27] <gwern> Gurkenglas: no, it doesn't sound like they are simply marking off DeFi bu cryptocurrency period total in every form and use
[00:34:32] <kuudes> gold mining could be haram while possessing gold would not be
[00:34:44] <gwern> holding gold still rewards gold mining
[00:34:57] <kuudes> yes, but it does not require gold mining
[00:35:14] <kuudes> ie gold holding would work even if no one ever again would not mine more of it
[00:35:58] <kuudes> a major thing I see a good thing in sharia financing is the undetachable bancruptcy of loans
[00:36:23] <kuudes> ie the whole "you must forgive the debt the debtor can't really really pay"
[00:37:05] <kuudes> coming from "no personal bancruptcy" jurisdiction that really speaks for me
[00:37:35] <Gurkenglas> because those in eternal debt tend to be tricked into it?
[00:38:46] <kuudes> that, or they had bad luck etc
[00:38:52] <Gurkenglas> can't they put "you must pay 1000$ or wash 5000 of our dishes" in the contract
[00:39:17] <kuudes> well collaterals etc still work
[00:39:52] <kuudes> the point is that in finland we had plenty of people whose housing loans were in foreign currency, so their collateral houses were not enough to pay their debts, so they just had no debt and no house in 90s
[00:40:00] <kuudes> *just had debt and no house
[00:40:19] <Gurkenglas> i suppose collateral-less debt is more harm for the indebted than good for the debtor
[00:40:22] <kuudes> and with interest rates >10% things are bad
[00:41:02] <kuudes> well, the us mortgage foreclosure system seems good in that you can just turn your house to your bank and be free of the debt
[00:42:31] <Gurkenglas> And finland could have had the contracts say that too, so it's all contract-complete
[00:44:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: I'll look in a bit
[00:45:51] <Gurkenglas> Are there politicians in any country that praise, like, the scientist that made a covid vaccine in two days, or israel for country-scale medical pioneering?
[00:47:11] <Gurkenglas> we could do with some countries competing to be the most praiseworthy by other countries
[00:47:21] *** Quits: two2thehead (~user@27.114.133.63) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:47:47] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, yes, anyone can lend anyone with any terms they agree on, to an extent, but rarely one wants to make such an exception for a random contract
[00:48:11] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, I have observed israel getting blame on third doses (hoarding)
[00:48:31] <kuudes> also on first doses early (cheating)
[00:48:52] <Gurkenglas> cheating by risking the health of their citizens and getting lucky?
[00:50:39] <kuudes> no, cheating as in the other people got their doses later
[00:51:00] <kuudes> and currently "third doses are stealing from poor africans their vaccines"
[00:51:58] <Gurkenglas> i mean, fair enough, mutating for new strains is the real issue and driven by the highest log-incidence
[00:55:22] <kuudes> personally I am in the prior that less than 3 doses on person does not reduce mutation count but linearly, and is therefore ineffective
[00:55:39] <kuudes> with 3+ doses it is possible to snuff local spread, which will cut mutation events superlinearly
[00:56:05] <kuudes> so we should concentrate the vaccines to such populations where we can hope with 3 doses per person to quickly snuff the local spread
[00:56:17] <kuudes> and that would be the best way to limit mutation count
[00:56:48] <kuudes> therefore: we should prioritize any smaller states or towns with high vaccine intake and give them 3rd doses asap
[00:56:49] <Gurkenglas> by snuff you mean "drive the virus locally extinct" or "keep r no larger than 1"
[00:56:55] <kuudes> make r<1
[00:57:14] <kuudes> so it will not spread now or later as long as the vaccine effect remains high enough
[00:57:19] <kuudes> likely at least 6 months
[00:57:27] * gwern saw his first Trump 2024 campaign sign today. ah well it was nice while it lasted
[00:57:48] <kuudes> they should use 14th amendment on him imo.
[00:58:15] <Gurkenglas> i think anywhere can get r<1 by locking down hard enough, so naive consequentalism says, bring the vaccines to the 20% of places that have the 80% of cases
[00:58:40] <kuudes> so, europe and usa?
[00:59:38] <kuudes> basicly vaccines are already going to developed countries. as the situation is that way, it seems to me that the most viable targets for 3 dosed local eradication are those same developed countries
[00:59:56] <kuudes> so in this way, indeed it would be also the benefit of africans to vaccinate europeans more...
[01:00:16] <Gurkenglas> what is the superlinear part
[01:00:46] <kuudes> if you snuff a spread of 5 million population, you get about 1/5M mutations or so
[01:01:07] <kuudes> if you just reduce the illness to half of its duration in the same population, you get about 1/2 mutations from baseline
[01:01:48] <kuudes> so with 2 dosing a 5M population you could get, say 2,5M mutation units, and with 3 dosing you would get maybe 0.001M mutation units or so
[01:02:09] <kuudes> with 0 doses you would in this thought experiment get 5M mutation units
[01:02:12] <Gurkenglas> surely the total number of viruses constructed in an unvaccinated person is way, way, way higher than in a vaccinated person
[01:02:23] <kuudes> maybe twice
[01:02:29] <kuudes> not thousand times more
[01:02:49] <kuudes> but if you stop local spread, you cut the amount of infected persons by factor of thousand or more
[01:03:13] <kuudes> so you should aim to keep partial herds completely virus free
[01:03:22] <kuudes> which happens if r<1 in that herd
[01:03:46] <Gurkenglas> how does that work, anyways? you'd think twice the duration means twice the time to exponentially replicate. shouldn't the war between viruses and immune system be less... undecided as you vary parameters?
[01:04:27] <kuudes> iirc 2 dose vaccinated are at least half as infective than unvaccinated
[01:04:57] <kuudes> their infective period is shorter than those of unvaccinated iirc, but indeed again not to 1/4, maybe 1/2
[01:05:17] <kuudes> you may get multiple of this sort of 1/2 factors, but you will not get to (1/2)^10 ~1/1000
[01:05:51] <kuudes> it is very different if you color the border of a circle or the area of the circle
[01:06:11] <kuudes> even if you use 50% ink for the area of sphere you will use more ink than if you color 100% the border of the circle
[01:06:17] <Gurkenglas> the area is relevant for mutations. (also the mutated virus has to then make it to another person)
[01:06:23] <kuudes> yes
[01:06:34] <kuudes> well, the amount of ink there is the amount of mutation events
[01:06:51] <kuudes> so the best strategy is to keep areas completely without ink
[01:07:13] <Gurkenglas> if 2 dosing is 1/4 mutations events then 2-dosing all regions is better than 3-dosing two thirds
[01:07:37] <kuudes> how so?
[01:07:54] <kuudes> hmm
[01:07:55] <Gurkenglas> because 1/3*1+2/3*0>1*1/4
[01:08:16] <kuudes> yeah, I guess
[01:08:26] <kuudes> but we are not able to 2 dose all
[01:08:44] <kuudes> we have about 8 bn doses this year, 48 bn doses 2022
[01:09:16] <kuudes> in 2022 we will be able to multidose way more people
[01:09:25] <kuudes> the question is on what we do this quarter
[01:09:49] <kuudes> and my point is that for instance in finland we have about 1/4 amount of population of doses sitting in storage
[01:09:57] <Gurkenglas> sequence every infection, stomp every new strain.
[01:10:00] <kuudes> while intake of 1st doses and 2nd doses is stopping
[01:10:09] <kuudes> they have halved testing here already
[01:10:29] <Gurkenglas> if you can't sequence every infection, lockdown until you can.
[01:10:36] <kuudes> we won't.
[01:10:52] <Gurkenglas> then you will be... less responsible than china for all this
[01:10:56] <kuudes> yes
[01:11:11] <Gurkenglas> where'd delta spawn, by the way?
[01:11:24] <kuudes> my main confusion is why we don't jab those 1/4 pop doses
[01:11:31] <kuudes> it was said india maybe
[01:11:49] <kuudes> or arounds
[01:11:57] <Gurkenglas> hmm so by population count us is up
[01:12:17] <kuudes> imo china does the responsible thing by keeping that tight border control
[01:12:40] <kuudes> they also have vaxxed a lot of people there, though their vaccine may be much less effective
[01:13:00] <kuudes> but in 2022 we indeed may get enough mrna vaccines to actually try to vaccinate everyone
[01:13:08] <kuudes> 2023 will have even more of them
[01:13:26] <kuudes> and that is a thing we should do more
[01:14:13] <Gurkenglas> What do you propose about anti-vaxxers? Fine until morale improves?
[01:14:32] <kuudes> personally I am for mandatory vaccination here
[01:14:41] <Gurkenglas> right and then they say no
[01:14:41] <kuudes> we already have the law, no more discussion is required.
[01:14:49] <kuudes> so what
[01:15:27] <kuudes> we already have patient record system, we can know who has not got vaccine
[01:15:35] <kuudes> so we can just send police to their home with nurse
[01:15:40] <kuudes> and jab them with 1 dosing vaccine
[01:16:03] <Gurkenglas> maybe you can get away with jailing them, but that sounds like it gets the Reichstag burned
[01:16:22] <kuudes> we have this plan for the case enemy Yellow A1 introduces smallpox into finland, this does not seem that different
[01:16:35] <kuudes> I am not talking about jailing, I am talking about forced vaccination.
[01:16:47] <kuudes> after the vax I don't care if they are fined or not
[01:16:49] <gwern> (being able to handle russian smallpox seems superimportant, yeah)
[01:16:58] <Gurkenglas> right, i am saying that jailing might work, but forced vaccination is gonna get ugly
[01:17:01] <gwern> (I mean, forget war use, they might just leak it)
[01:17:06] <kuudes> indeed
[01:17:49] <kuudes> finland had "forgot" smallpox vaccined doses for some 80% of population which was in breach of international treaties and I suppose they were destroyed when they were found in the late 00s
[01:18:12] <kuudes> maybe they were sunk into some lake in waterproof containers. I hear that is a good way to dispose of lot of things
[01:18:30] <saturn2> we need a pro-vax stalin
[01:19:37] <kuudes> "if  comprehensive vaccination is necessary to prevent the spread of a generally hazardous communicable disease  capable of causing substantial harm to the life  and health of the population or a part thereof." it seems to me it does not require very creative interpretation of law to find out current situation matches to this.
[01:20:13] <kuudes> and it is even better that this has not been decided by the current parliament but the last parliament
[01:20:52] <kuudes> so this is not making up new rules but just implement the rules we already have, and which have been duly weighted against different rights and duties of parties of society
[01:21:10] <kuudes> they are in accordance of constitution, of eu human rights and international human rights.
[01:21:15] <Gurkenglas> in the end even in the case where the pandemic just keeps going with endless strains... might still help train earth for biotech resilience. lot of good that'll do when someone accidentally the ocean.
[01:21:22] <kuudes> because it was indeed vetted heavily before the parliament accepted it

[01:46:37] <Jayson_Virissimo> Good thing to have on hand, but I don't have any.
[01:46:55] <Gurkenglas> not paying for tests seems fair enough. why not pay people to get vaccinated too? "because it'll cause past people to wait to get vaccinated" <- that's fine, because there used to be queues

[01:54:17] <kuudes> that is basically what the current vaccine certificate thing is about
[01:54:46] <kuudes> but if vaccine is voluntary, then you can't punish people from not doing a voluntary action

[01:55:21] <mst> kuudes: people had been wondering who the mission redshirt was
[01:55:33] <Gurkenglas> raising taxes and rewarding people for getting a vaccine is equivalent to punishing people for not getting it, right?
[01:56:18] <kuudes> yes, many say so

[01:58:45] <sh0> Ah. Because in Germany or the US, that might be official policy but it's not like they can enforce it. So it's more like "ban".
[01:58:48] <kuudes> people get turned out from vaccination if they have got their 2 doses and are not eligible for third and do not lie well enough
[01:59:36] <kuudes> I tried to get a dose for my 6 year old with a prescription, and got my friend who is doctor in a small town to agree on it, but he called me the morning of that day that he got cold feet and it would not go through
[01:59:39] <gwern> kuudes: however seriously, this is another example of how small airplanes are frigging death traps
[02:00:04] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, why not both allow excessive taxation and not technically leaving anyone no choice but to get a vaccine
[02:00:17] <Jayson_Virissimo> kuudes: what're you opinion on the cost-benefit for 6YOs?
[02:00:19] <kuudes> sh0, vaccines are not yet in pharmacies, they are only available throught the state who gives them to towns
[02:00:49] <kuudes> Jayson_Virissimo, in usa they voted 17-0 for it, and the paper seems ok and my kid didn't die when she was in that trial and austria is doing it
[02:01:10] <kuudes> and half of developed world has been vaccinated and we don't observe people dying out of ~1/50k range for it
[02:01:17] <Jayson_Virissimo> kuudes: which trial? Pfizer?
[02:01:21] <kuudes> pfizer
[02:01:42] <kuudes> basicly it seems to me that the vaccine is sort of comparable in safety to orange juice or something - people can drown in it as well
[02:02:01] <sh0> (Theoretically. It would be an impressive feat to get enough of it for that...)
[02:02:04] <Jayson_Virissimo> I just got my 8YO a antibody test. If it comes back negative, then I'll be seriously considering the Pfizer vaccine (which is readily available where I am).
[02:02:10] <kuudes> do it.
[02:02:19] <kuudes> I don't see any reason not to do it
[02:02:33] <sh0> Well, your 8YO might whine about it.

[02:04:10] <kuudes> my 8 year old was part of the trial population, that might biase me or something
[02:04:26] <kuudes> 2/3 chance she got vaccine, 1/3 placebo
[02:04:39] <kuudes> she got redness and mild fever, so either good nocebo or vaccine
[02:04:45] <nshepperd> mst: I'd expect Econ undergrads to be more likely than average to consider the net utility of raising the price of a good or service
[02:05:01] <nshepperd> at least the ones that don't fail out
[02:05:14] <sh0> Yeaaah. Honestly, "written by econ undergrad" sounds like a major step up for most laws...
[02:05:20] <mjr> kuudes, when's the unblind?
[02:05:24] <kuudes> december
[02:05:45] <kuudes> I would have accepted even a full dose for my 6 year old
[02:05:48] <mjr> anyway symptoms are indicative yeah
[02:06:13] <kuudes> kids doses are 10 units, adult pfizer is 30 units, adult moderna is 100 units, moderna for kids and moderna booster is 50 units
[02:06:26] <sh0> Make sure to raise the concern that their placebo may be flawed and so the study may be insufficiently blinded...
[02:06:32] <kuudes> <5 yo pfizer is 3 units, but it is not yet approved
[02:07:06] <kuudes> sh0, it appears from https://www.nejm.org/na101/home/literatum/publisher/mms/journals/content/nejm/0/nejm.ahead-of-print/nejmoa2116298/20211109/images/img_medium/nejmoa2116298_f2.jpeg that placebo caused some adverse effects more than the vaccine though
[02:07:10] <kuudes> so I guess I could be mistaken
[02:07:14] <mst> nshepperd: I was mostly facepalming at the ineffectiveness of the policy
[02:07:32] <mst> nshepperd: "people randomly complaining about economists" is kinda background noise on much of the internet ;)
[02:07:43] <Gurkenglas> when i was at a test center i just thought "why am i waiting next to 10 other people who have a reason to get tested" so maybe making people get tested less is fine
[02:07:44] <kuudes> placebo caused more headache and joint pain and as much chills
[02:07:56] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, yes.

[02:09:10] <kuudes> drive ins are outside, ventilation is good
[02:09:53] <kuudes> I still have the 4 bottles of ratvac from february in my fridge, but it feels maybe too risky to give to my kid
[02:10:11] <nshepperd> sh0: most laws seem to be written with roughly the economic sophistication of a child playing with dolls yeah
[02:10:15] <sh0> <evil_economist_voice> But consider! If we make testing dangerous, that adds even more incentive for people to get vaccinated! "You're going to get covid-19, would you like it to be dead first?" MUAHAHAHAHA

[02:17:42] <rmmh> where's the prediction market for when lockdowns end
[02:17:44] <saturn2> i figured
[02:20:04] <Dyo> wonder how many ppl got their 2nd dose way too early, resulting in low antibody counts. maybe relatively early (looking at other vaccinations, doesn't necessarily apply 1:1) 3rd dose is to partially correct botched 2nd doses
[02:22:00] <kuudes> Dyo, that is indeed mentioned. over here they moved second dose to be 12 weeks after first
[02:22:19] <kuudes> another thing is that it seems to me that maybe kids dose would be enough for booster doses
[02:22:46] <kuudes> ie maybe we could put 3x10 units in 3 consecutive months instead of 1 30 unit dose
[02:23:24] <kuudes> to me the obvious next course would be to just jab everyone willing once per 13 weeks

[03:30:55] <ggreer> ok so apparently wisconsin law about minors carrying guns is very complicated and nobody really knows what it's supposed to mean. the judge and the defense seem to agree that it says: if you're under 16, you need a hunting certificate to possess a long gun (handguns are just plain banned)
[03:31:14] <ggreer> if you're 16-18, you need a hunting license to possess a long gun *while hunting*
[03:31:23] <ggreer> and if you're under 18, you can't possess a short barreled rifle
[03:31:35] <ggreer> rittenhouse was 17 and not hunting, therefore... he might walk
[03:31:46] <ggreer> Prosecution: "If it is allowed that simply being 17 he is in compliance with that, it swallows the whole statute and the statute makes no sense."
[03:31:46] <ggreer> Judge: "Well if it makes no sense, you're out of luck."
[03:32:14] <ggreer> it looks like a mistake by the legislators could cause him to be acquitted on all charges
[03:33:12] <rmmh> a child walks free once again!!
[03:33:20] <ggreer> oh and the rifle he had was not an SBR (barrel length <16" or overall length <26" IIRC)
[03:34:54] <rmmh> have they entirely given up on any sort of murder charge, and now they're just trying for *some* sort of weapons violation?
[03:35:11] <ggreer> they threw the book at him. they're trying to get something to stick
[03:35:27] <galambo> do you guys think the world will continue to get exponentially crazier?
[03:35:29] <ggreer> including violating curfew, though the judge dismissed that one
[03:35:58] <saturn2> so if you're over 18, you can hunt without a hunting license? or if you're 16-18 you can hunt without a gun?
[03:36:17] <galambo> I think we should just scrap all gun laws
[03:36:39] <ggreer> saturn2: I guess there's bow hunting. like I said the laws are insanely complicated because we want to let kids hunt, but we also don't want kids carrying guns around all the time
[03:36:43] <rmmh> galambo: I think countries get monotonically more insane until they have a revolution and do a ground-up rewrite of their laws
[03:36:49] <ggreer> amusingly gaige isn't being charged with unlawfully carrying concealed or violating curfew or attempted murder or... anything
[03:37:15] <galambo> how about air rifles?
[03:38:04] <ggreer> depends on the state. some restrict them if kinetic energy is high enough. some just ban air rifles for hunting because the laws haven't caught up to the technical advances in air rifles
[03:38:05] <galambo> I used to have an air rifle. I thought it was pretty dangerous. but I managed to buy one as a kid in egypt. I didnt need a license even though gun laws in egypt are pretty strict
[03:38:18] <saturn2> i think revolutions are probably impossible in advanced economies thanks to mass surveillance and nukes
[03:38:22] <ggreer> you can't reliably take down a deer with an air rifle unless it's a fucking huge air rifle
[03:38:51] <ggreer> also most states have laws about minimum caliber or kinetic energy when hunting. you can't go hunting deer with a .22 because you're likely to injure the deer and cause it lots of suffering
[03:40:06] <galambo> .22 to handguns is bb to air rifles

[05:03:42] <feepbot> A Defense of Functional Decision Theory - LessWrong 2.0 viewer (This post is an attempt to refute an article offering critique on Functional Decision Theory (FDT). If you’re new to FDT, I recommend reading this introductory paper by Eliezer Yudkowsky & Nate Soares (Y&S). The critique I attempt to [snip])
[05:04:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now, I won't pretend to understand decision theories enough to have an opinion on the purely technical merits of this, but (and I recall thinking this when I read MacAskill's thing originally): exactly how relevant can these esoteric "flaws" or "problems" be if you have to construct such scenarios to illustrate them?
[05:05:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, the "Bomb" scenario is one where:
[05:05:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> 1. "You are the only person left in the universe. You have a happy life, but you know that you will never meet another agent again, nor face another situation where any of your actions will have been predicted by another agent."
[05:05:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2. "A long-dead predictor predicted whether you would choose Left or Right, by running a simulation of you and seeing what that simulation did. ... The predictor has a failure rate of only 1 in a trillion trillion."
[05:05:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> 3. Somehow, you face two open boxes, and you *must* choose one (because... why? reasons).
[05:06:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean... what the heck?
[05:07:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> What if FDT gives the "wrong" answer in this case? Is that bad? Is that a problem? Maybe that's actually ok, because *nothing like this will ever happen ever*??
[05:11:33] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[05:14:02] <pompolic> man i thought i had something insightful to say but ended up stating the obvious
[05:14:49] <pompolic> "it seems to me that FDT is made for dealing with agents that can predict you seemingly preternaturally well"
[05:17:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Perhaps true but also pretty much irrelevant in the given scenario
[05:17:40] <pompolic> yeah
[05:17:54] <pompolic> the real world analogue i was thinking of is dealing with adults as a kid
[05:17:58] <pompolic> and pulling one over them
[05:18:47] <pompolic> they could predict what i would do within my means (or had put systems in place to that end long ago)
[05:19:01] <pompolic> which also sounds like "long-dead predictor"
[05:22:35] <pompolic> i don't really have a conclusion to draw
[05:23:25] <pompolic> when i wear my security hat i must ask "have you considered this "unlikely" edge case (edge case is actually very likely because the adversary is intelligent)"
[05:23:39] <pompolic> when i wear my programmer hat i must ask "do you really think that would happen"
[05:24:14] <pompolic> maybe i will troll an infosec conference by making a presentation about FDT
[05:26:09] <pompolic> FDT as "how to deal with someone pentesting your decision theory"
[05:26:11] <saturn2> if your decision theory exhibits unexpected behavior in these weird scenarios, it's evidence that it has bugs which might cause problems in less weird scenarios
[05:27:44] <pompolic> i feel like i can draw an analogy to computer code wrt that
[05:29:10] <pompolic> c.f. finding a crash with a fuzzer, then finding an example that doesn't merely crash it
[05:29:40] <pompolic> i've read that software bugs have a tendency to cluster; i wonder if that also applies to decision theory bugs
[05:30:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Yeah it is *evidence*, but it's not *directly a problem*
[05:30:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, that can't by itself be a critique of FDT
[05:30:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or at least, not a critique of any substance
[05:30:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway I posted a comment
[05:30:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not about this though
[05:36:23] <saturn2> i would at least want some analysis showing that all possible problems with analogous structure are equally weird and unlikely

[05:41:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Yes... the thing is that every other decision theory also has big problems, and not even in any outlandishly unlikely scenarios
[05:42:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you want that kind of analysis, maybe you won't get it for FDT, but you *definitely* won't get it for CDT, EDT, etc.
[05:44:17] * RiversHaveWings licks an ice cream cone, nya~
[05:45:11] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: my god. you should be sent to a concentration camp
[05:45:32] <gwern> you're little better than an animal. specifically, a *cat*. (or possibly a dog, depending on where we are in the analogy)
[05:45:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow Leon Kass was right, it *is* a cat-like behavior!!
[05:46:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm what about self-licking ice cream cones, those would be extra-bad, right?
[05:46:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, for example, government-employed bioethics committees
[05:46:43] <pompolic> :D
[05:48:57] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: the bug reports are still important even if CDT and EDT are worse
[05:49:04] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: self-licking ice cream cones would be even worse than masturbation, one can only assum
[05:49:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway. Not too long ago I complained that my go-to brand of sour cream (a high-fat sour cream, with ~twice the fat content of other brands) had silently (without changing the package labeling, which still said "high fat"!) changed their formulation, reducing the fat content but adding thickeners to make it *seem* like it was still high-quality
[05:50:12] <Betawolf> but a self-licking ice cream cone would prevent humans from licking it, and thus move a little closer to a world where humans don't exist, which of course is the most bioethical world
[05:50:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, now I have figured out how to make my own sour cream. Another in the growing list of food products replaced by DIY
[05:51:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Yes true but my point is that "FDT has flaws in these obscure scenarios" isn't, relatively speaking, a criticism, because it's made against the backdrop of "CDT/EDT have flaws in much less obscure scenarios". It absolutely is a sign that we should investigate further, but again, compare that to CDT or EDT, where we don't have to investigate anything because we already know that it has very bad problems
[05:52:36] <saturn2> ok, sure
[05:53:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sort of like ... you have a choice to drive a car or ride a motorcycle to work. You read an article that suggests that sometimes in some very rare circumstances, your car's airbag might explode and kill you, maybe. Well, ok, that's worrying and bears further investigation, but if you ride a motorcycle you already know for sure that you have a high chance of horrible death
[05:54:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> That certainly can't be the basis of any sort of "cars are more dangerous than motorcycles" type critique
[05:55:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This hypothetical scenario brought to you by the 2013 Toyota exploding-airbag recall)
[05:57:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Not to be confused with the 2013 Toyota spider-related recall)
[05:59:32] <saturn2> yes, i agree we shouldn't go back to CDT or EDT
[05:59:48] <gwern> no one ever seems to laugh when I suggest GMT
[06:00:46] <Betawolf> Grand Master Theory is only known to a few.
[06:02:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: However, I wouldn't kill myself with a bomb even if FDT told me to...
[06:03:03] <pompolic> in code geass R2, lelouch predicts schneizel's responses and pre-records a conversation, in order to sneak up on him
[06:03:09] <pompolic> if only schneizel had known about FDT
[06:03:35] <saturn2> i guess i would kill myself with the bomb
[06:03:37] <ggreer> that anime was a guilty pleasure. so many ridiculous plots. still it was fun
[06:04:40] <gwern> I wonder if the sequel will remember that it was best when it was ridiculous
[06:05:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> I admit that I would not have kept watching that show if not for that dude who did the voice of the Emperor
[06:05:45] <saturn2> i think the confusion comes from not taking all aspects of the scenario equally seriously, particularly the one in ten trillion bit
[06:05:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Norio Wakamoto. That guy is amazing
[06:07:14] <saturn2> but there's another reason not to open the bomb box, which is that there are no other agents so therefore money has no value
[06:07:29] <gwern> (I was wondering how that sequel has been going and there's shockingly little about it online for something that supposedly has been in production since december last year... wonder if it got squeezed out by all the competing projects)
[06:08:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Yeah the scenario doesn't make internal sense, which makes it hard to evaluate...
[06:11:32] <pompolic> ggreer: it's not even guilty for me
[06:11:41] <pompolic> gwern: do you mean R3? I saw R3
[06:11:54] <gwern> pompolic: no, _z of the recapture_ or some bizarre title like that
[06:12:07] <ggreer> I also liked how lelouch reveled in killing his opponents. IIRC in the second episode of season 2 he collapses a skyscraper onto a shitload of opposing soldiers (including the commander) and just laughs as it happens
[06:12:11] <pompolic> oh, that sounds like a new one
[06:15:22] <pompolic> ggreer: i guess it's an interesting contrast with how he is at the start
[06:16:04] <ggreer> I watched the first two episodes of season 2 before anything else. it was confusing but also fun since I was effectively put in lelouch's shoes
[06:16:35] <pompolic> neat
[06:17:06] <pompolic> also i kind of like how, upon witnessing the whole skyscraper thing everyone is like "yep, that's the real guy"
[06:17:20] <pompolic> strong brand presence
[06:18:40] <gwern> naturally. 'Zero'? the mask? 'Knights of Zero'? dude clearly understood marketing
[06:19:07] <ggreer> it'd be like if two planes crashed into the petronas towers and osama showed up on the TV. "oh shit. we didn't get him"
[06:20:40] <gwern> into the what
[06:20:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> !wp petronas towers
[06:20:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh right

[07:13:45] <mst> adiabatic: oh, yeah, BigRat ftw
[07:13:48] <shawwwn> Oho, quick on the trigger tonight <3
[07:13:51] <mst> fucking floats
[07:14:14] <shawwwn> and I see float criticism is a popular topic
[07:14:28] <mst> floats are an awesome approximation for performance
[07:14:57] <adiabatic> shawwwn: this is what happens when you have Spotlight and have that particular file named ~/Dropbox/Photos/Memes/Invincible/look at what they need to mimic a fraction of our power/look at what they need to mimic a fraction.png
[07:14:59] <mst> when controllable precision matters, rationals or decimals are often better
[07:15:07] <mst> programming: trade-offs all the way down
[07:15:19] <adiabatic> Have meme? Need meme? Got meme.
[07:15:37] <shawwwn> adiabatic: a gentleman of fine breeding and good standing in society
[07:15:47] <mst> shawwwn: also, us.
[07:16:00] <shawwwn> mst too
[07:16:06] <adiabatic> This is what a man can do with unlimited-length path names and a proper searcher
[07:16:30] <adiabatic> aren't decimals just floats with base 10 instead of base 2?
[07:17:14] <gwern> (the problem with the (Int,Int) representation is that it's not particularly hardware accelerated and the Ints rapidly blow up and take you into BigInteger territory if you do more than trivial operations, right?)
[07:19:12] <adiabatic> 152 characters. Can't flex on the Windows users with a short-ass path name like that.
[07:20:12] <shawwwn> I think Python struck the right balance for regular ints. Why can’t it do the same for floats? *Common Lisp intensifies*
[07:21:05] <adiabatic> what does CL do for floats?
[07:21:07] <shawwwn> Also apparently a number is an object in Python, but they special case the numbers from 0 to 42 or something. So id(42) == id(42) but id(98373) is not necessarily equal to id(98373)
[07:22:03] <shawwwn> I wish I remembered. Possibly I’m misremembering. But I swore that cl does something where you can get exactly the amount of precision you want on demand
[07:22:18] <shawwwn> But as a language feature
[07:22:19] <adiabatic> saturn2: *cough*
[07:22:28] <shawwwn> Maybe that’s just for integers though
[07:23:02] <saturn2> CL has bignums and rationals
[07:24:29] <gwern> I remember CL's math hierarchy as being quite elaborate and well thought out, although the details are lost in the mists of time
[07:24:47] <gwern> (since lisp was used for so much symbolic math work, I assume that's part of why)
[07:25:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok so. Suppose I have a wiki, right, and let's assume that: (1) there exist one or more that any one, possibly including bad people, can edit; (2) among the things one can edit into a wikipage is some special markup that can specify entirely arbitrary HTTP headers to be sent when that page is loaded
[07:25:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> What bad things can be done in such a case?
[07:25:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> *there exist one or more pages
[07:28:39] <mst> adiabatic: decimals tend to be for scientific or financial things where 'decimal with X precision' is a specifically understood concept that people can't complain about, yes
[07:29:48] <saturn2> clisp has arbitrary-precision long floats, but that's an extra feature not required by the standard
[07:30:43] <mst> number towers are always 'interesting' tbh
[07:32:00] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: redirecting to https://steal-your-credit-card.cx/
[07:33:18] <pompolic> http headers sent by the server?
[07:33:48] <pompolic> the two relevant terms that come to mind is "open redirect", which is the above
[07:34:07] <adiabatic> There's also the Link header that might inject naughty from the above site: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Link
[07:34:08] <shawwwn> TIL treadmill racing is a thing https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM8VJGTAH/
[07:34:18] <feepbot> Link - HTTP | MDN
[07:34:35] <pompolic> the other is, if it can make the client send arbitrary headers, you might be able to do something like "request stuffing" which has niche uses like bypassing filters
[07:34:52] <pompolic> er, request smuggling
[07:34:59] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: they could set an invalid HSTS header and lock people out of visiting your site again?
[07:35:09] <saturn2> probably lots of other bad stuff too
[07:35:15] <saturn2> seems like a bad idea
[07:35:37] <gwern> shawwwn: login wall, but I doubt it's cooler than https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTAAsCNK7RA

[07:35:56] <shawwwn> Ugh tiktok why you login wall
[07:36:16] <adiabatic> how are they gonna figure out what we like if we don't have an account
[07:36:18] <shawwwn> And yes, you’re not missing out on … anything
[07:36:29] <pompolic> i think they can also maybe mess with cross origin policy headers?
[07:36:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Oh, tell me about the invalid HSTS header thing?
[07:37:04] <pompolic> which is some sort of stupid webshit magic about declaring to the browser what domains scripts etc. are allowed to be loaded from if i recall
[07:37:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> The redirect thing, I like that, obvious but a classic
[07:37:27] <pompolic> combiness well with phishing site
[07:37:33] <pompolic> combines*
[07:40:57] <pompolic> i don't know how you could set an invalid HSTS header, since it just specifies the expiration time, but they could set max-age to 0, which would disable HSTS
[07:41:00] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: oh sorry i was thinking of HPKP and i guess newer browsers have removed that feature
[07:41:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> k
[07:42:20] <pompolic> (which would open up e.g. stripping HTTPS via proxying the site, or just downgrading to http or whatever)
[07:43:14] <saturn2> here's something annoying https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Clear-Site-Data
[07:43:25] <feepbot> Clear-Site-Data - HTTP | MDN (The Clear-Site-Data header clears browsing data (cookies, storage, cache) associated with the requesting website. It allows web developers to have more control over the data stored by a client browser for their origins.)
[07:43:45] <pompolic> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin this is the cross origin policy one i mentioned; they'd need to combine it with having a <script> tag that actually loads the script from the origin this whitelists
[07:43:49] <pompolic> i think
[07:43:56] <feepbot> Access-Control-Allow-Origin - HTTP | MDN (The Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header indicates whether the response can be shared with requesting code from the given origin.)
[07:44:48] <shawwwn> imagine an integer

[07:44:58] <shawwwn> now pretend it's a fish
[07:45:07] <shawwwn> now display it on a monitor
[07:45:10] <saturn2> gwern: yes
[07:45:12] <shawwwn> what do you you get?
[07:45:18] <shawwwn> one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish
[07:45:25] <saturn2> gwern: it also has a feature that reloads every tab you have open on the same domain
[07:45:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Haha what
[07:46:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is terrible
[07:48:19] <nshepperd2> i love allowing web developers to have more control over my client browser
[07:48:47] <adiabatic> retvrn to gemini
[07:48:59] <gwern> a header which deletes everything is a pretty interesting one. would make debugging hard. and they could screw with you by doing a bunch of redirects first
[07:49:29] <gwern> hm. they could mass edit the site to stick the delete or redirect thereof into each page. that would be especially hard to debug
[07:49:50] <shawwwn> reloading every tab on the same domain was implicitly achieved by using local storage hacks before that, iirc
[07:50:03] <gwern> they could salt in a bunch of infinite loop redirects to confuse you
[07:50:15] <shawwwn> localstorage is the OG way to communicate across tabs

[13:54:12] <PlanckWalk> I think all those weird conditions in the Critque of FDT bomb secnario were pre-emptive removal of edge cases that ended up removal pretty much the whole thing.  It would work without almost all those conditions, but there would always be that one jerk who said "but what if ..."
[13:55:05] <PlanckWalk> ... and then the whole discussion would devolve around those edge cases instead of the core.

[16:00:30] <PlanckWalk> It might be slightly more interesting if the left box paid out $100 instead of just nothing.  Then you get to ask questions like "would you choose to play this game at all?"
[16:15:10] <PlanckWalk> Hmm, 1 in a trillion trillion is hellishly small.  I wonder how that compares with the likelihood of things like intending to grab the left box but momentarily confusing left from right, or mishearing the instructions, or stumbling on the way and accidentaly grabbing the other box to steady yourself?

[16:19:46] <PlanckWalk> So if accidents are vastly more likely than mispedictions, Omega needs to be able to predict the accidents as well.

[16:28:37] <PlanckWalk> I guess it doesn't matter much.  It's still reasonable to treat Omega as effectively infallible, and if you accidentally grab the left box through some slapstick accident then Omega still predicted that and you don't blow up.
[16:30:38] <PlanckWalk> I don't know how Omega can predict things with that accuracy given that there are potential influences that are in your past light cone but outside Omega's.

[16:37:58] <feepbot> kuudes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipism Flipism, sometimes written as "flippism", is a pseudophilosophy under which decisions are made by flipping a coin. It originally appeared in the Donald Duck Disney comic "Flip Decision" by Carl Barks, published in 1953.

[16:38:12] <PlanckWalk> Oh haha.
[16:38:23] <kuudes> it has uses, already recommended by sun tzu
[16:38:52] <PlanckWalk> If Omega can predict the coin, then it doesn't really make a difference I think.
[16:38:53] <kuudes> if your opponent can react after you issue an order, issue order randomly so that you don't know which way you ordered
[16:39:07] <kuudes> well, yes. but can they?
[16:39:11] <PlanckWalk> If they can't, then it's a Really Bad Idea.
[16:39:44] <kuudes> well it is stated omega does not want to kill the real you in any case, and only bullies you if it knows you yield
[16:40:04] <kuudes> so I would think a trule random choice would be enough to prevent bullying
[16:40:20] <kuudes> and still reduce your expected payout to 50

[16:40:56] <PlanckWalk> It's not consistent with the error rate though

[16:41:11] <PlanckWalk> (Even if only 1 in a trillion people flip a coin)
[16:41:32] <kuudes> no, all of you would flip a coin
[16:42:14] <PlanckWalk> Oh, are you supposing the error rate stated is only the false negative (people exploding) rate?

[16:45:41] <PlanckWalk> Actually I guess forget that, it still has lower average than always picking the bomb box.

[19:22:15] <feep> in corona news, holy shit
[19:22:36] <feep> our infection rate tracker has a new color marker
[19:22:48] <feep> for I think 1000+ incidence
[19:26:44] <feep> for ~some reason~ all focused on the border to czechia and austria I have no idea why such a thing should be the case it is a mystery.
[19:27:20] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: why is there a surge of infections in germany exactly
[19:30:14] <feep> No idea! No reason!
[19:30:27] <feep> well, I mean, there's lots of reasons if we start you know, stretching for reasons
[19:30:53] <PapuaHardyNet> strange
[19:30:58] <feep> like how our politicians have basically given up on restrictions because they're political suicide at this point
[19:31:26] <feep> and our vaccination progress is only 67%
[19:31:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Probably it is Putin's fault somehow
[19:32:02] <feep> otoh, it also should be noted that we border two countries that have higher incidence than we have, and ~somehow~ like half the really affected counties are on the border
[19:32:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> When in doubt, blame it on the KGB
[19:32:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Historically this is a sound strategy
[19:32:20] <feep> srsly, https://corona.rki.de/ look at it!
[19:32:30] <feepbot> Experience
[19:32:37] <feep> and nobody talks about this, probably cause close the borders got claimed by rightwingers early in and is now poison
[19:33:05] <feep> or because we'd have to talk about how much of the economy in those areas lives and dies with guest workers
[19:33:18] <PapuaHardyNet> what are 'guest workers"?
[19:33:23] <feep> er, foreigners
[19:33:29] <feep> that don't live here but do work here
[19:33:45] <PapuaHardyNet> interesting. that's legal I assume since they are EU citizens
[19:33:50] <feep> yes exactly
[19:33:58] <PapuaHardyNet> so they should have the same benefits that are extended to DE citizens
[19:33:58] <feep> the problem is anti-eu is still captured by like two parties
[19:34:04] <feep> the extreme left and the almost-literal nazis.
[19:34:28] <kuudes> feep, I have presumed they are doing the same in germany as they were maybe doing here
[19:34:41] <kuudes> ie after vaccinating people who wanted it, remove restrictions
[19:34:49] <feep> kuudes: well, it is what is happening
[19:34:50] <kuudes> but we are now learning it was not a good idea?
[19:34:56] <feep> I think it is a stretch to say that they are "doing" it.
[19:35:23] <kuudes> over here the officials have specifically ruled that school exposures won't be traced and quarantined
[19:35:34] <kuudes> and kids are recommended against being tested
[19:35:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> What is that excellent German word...
[19:35:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> "gastarbeiter"
[19:36:11] <feep> yes
[19:36:13] <kuudes> guest worked, literally
[19:36:16] <kuudes> *worker
[19:36:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Russian has borrowed it. One of the better linguistic imports)
[19:36:57] <kuudes> vierastyöläinen in finnish, vieras = guest, unknown; työläinen = worker, person with work, työ=work
[19:37:58] <kuudes> (työläs = tedious, thing that requires labor)
[19:38:53] <kuudes> feep, over here about everyone else but the healthcare minister wants to open the borders
[19:39:13] <kuudes> note that we already allow anyone fully vaccinated in without quarantine, and people from schengen with tests
[19:39:23] <kuudes> so basicly they would want unvaccinated britons and russians
[19:39:52] <kuudes> which is... you know, have they looked into the numbers in those places, and the selection for nonvaccination?
[19:40:32] <kuudes> feep, have you got a booster?
[19:41:32] <feep> kuudes: nope, five to six months minimum over here
[19:41:40] <feep> my parents will get eligible for one soonish
[19:41:47] <kuudes> I give you my permission to lie to get it.
[19:41:51] <feep> until then, I'm advising them to basically not leave the house
[19:42:06] <feep> kuudes: still not really worried about myself.
[19:42:11] <kuudes> you can go to another doctor and tell them it is your first dose
[19:42:29] <feep> actual dialog with my parents
[19:43:02] <feep> "yeah I considered going to the supermarket early in" (I said best to go soon after opening, cause the air will have had maximum time to circulate) "but there's a queue of old people in the morning"
[19:43:17] <feep> me: "good - if they had corona, they wouldn't be at the store, they'd be on a ventilator"
[19:43:53] <feep> I still think that's basically correct, though I don't know the relative risk factors
[19:44:13] <feep> like, would you rather go to a store two hours later filled with half the amount of people in their 40s
[19:44:22] <kuudes> ffp3
[19:44:26] <feep> obviously
[19:44:33] <feep> mostly protects others tho
[19:44:34] <kuudes> also home delivery if possible
[19:44:36] <kuudes> no
[19:44:43] <kuudes> ffp masks protect the wearer
[19:44:51] <feep> yes, but by ratio mostly others
[19:44:53] <kuudes> I have moved to having exhaling filter
[19:45:01] <kuudes> if other people don't want to wear a mask, their problem
[19:45:10] <feep> that's mostly your problem I think
[19:45:20] <feep> in any case, masks are still mandatory approximately everywhere here
[19:45:23] <kuudes> unless I am with people who may have orders, then I wear a surgical on top of the valve
[19:45:24] <feep> never stopped
[19:45:34] <kuudes> we never have had mask mandate
[19:45:37] <kuudes> only recommendations
[19:45:39] <feep> welp
[19:45:42] <kuudes> and they have dropped that also
[19:46:29] <kuudes> you guys at least have had ventilation recommendations
[19:46:58] <kuudes> over here the local authorities shun those, even though they are recommended hidden in the back pages of recommendations from state officials
[19:47:26] <kuudes> but if ffp3 feels inadequate, use p3?
[19:47:53] <kuudes> that is easy to wear and clearly protects the wearer
[19:48:56] <feep> again: not really worried about myself
[19:49:15] <feep> especially cause we're "only" at 400/100k even now
[19:51:02] <kuudes> we are at 160/100k-14d on country, 135/100k-14d in local region
[19:51:21] <kuudes> though testing has got halved and on local region test positivity rate is around 14%
[19:52:17] <feep> sidenote: watching the r value precisely oscillate around 1.0 is darkly funny.
[19:52:33] <feep> control system hard at work
[19:52:57] <kuudes> shouldn't they set the upper limit a little lower than at 1?
[19:53:10] <feep> the problem is nobody is targeting r.
[19:53:18] <feep> which is why it looks like that.
[19:53:25] <kuudes> oh?
[19:53:40] <kuudes> they are target cases or hospitalizations or deaths?
[19:53:47] <feep> cases, yeah.
[19:54:02] <kuudes> over here they moved to targeting hospitalizations, which caused this loosening
[19:54:16] <kuudes> but yes, r -> cases -> hospitalizations -> deaths
[19:54:20] <feep> I think they tried that here too, but idk if they got it in yet
[19:55:05] <kuudes> I hope things could change on monday now that the health ministery sent a new guidance to local authorities and the government voiced mild positive for battling the disease again

Mr. Trump later boasted that he was unbothered, but Mr. Christie said he spoke with Mr. Trump about it. “Just beside himself with fury,” Mr. Christie writes.' <-- increasingly, it seems...
[21:13:41] <gwern> ...like every account of 'why was trump even running' leads back to this

[21:17:33] <gwern> it's like that scene where the bully doesn't realize what he's doing
[21:18:06] <two2thehead> that's... surprisingly apt
[21:18:08] <kuudes> so... 7 of 9 caused Trump presidency?
[21:18:21] <two2thehead> now THAT is a good take :V
[21:18:54] <kuudes> in the future we will have stone tables that detail the creation of the world starting with 7 of 9 to Trump and farther...
[21:19:07] <two2thehead> every person should have their BIG5 and dark tetrad score in a database somewhere
[21:19:36] <two2thehead> and three letter agencies should use that to best humiliate narcissists from ever running for office. Change my mind
[21:19:44] <PapuaHardyNet> two2thehead: campbell's law
[21:20:14] <two2thehead> that's definitely a possibility
[21:20:57] <two2thehead> I suppose you could derive it surreptitiously?
[21:21:21] <two2thehead> remember, we're not talking about trump per se. We are talking about narcissists in general
[21:21:51] <two2thehead> similar to how median iq changes leads to changes in the far tails
[21:22:21] <gwern> obama is pretty narcissistic himself, and bad at managing people. he was probably completely surprised
[21:22:36] <two2thehead> yep
[21:22:43] <two2thehead> he's thin skinned
[21:22:57] <gwern> he's a passive narcissist, trump is the angry rage kind
