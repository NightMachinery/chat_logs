[14:35:07] <ychaouche> Hello #sed gurus, I'd like to replace either space /tab or commas with a new line, I tried this : sed  s/[,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?go=Go&search=:space:]/'\n'/g < /tmp/maintenance, it doesn't replace any.
[14:35:20] <ychaouche> hah
[14:36:13] <ychaouche> this : https://gist.github.com/ychaouche/6793f4d6a530e371354af025bface1e1
[14:36:36] <ychaouche> It seems like my client doesn't like some syntaxe
[14:38:16] <ychaouche> sed  s/[,[[:space:]]]/'\n'/g
[14:38:21] <ychaouche> that's better
[14:38:50] <ychaouche> I didn't know konversation had auto-replace features enabled.
[14:42:33] <tirnanog> one thing to note is that \n is a GNU-ism. also, you don't need quite that many square brackets to get the job done. sed 's/[,[:space:]]/\n/g' would do. for this, I'd just use tr(1) which will work anywhere: tr ',[:space:]' '\n'
[14:45:25] <Earnest> afaiui, \n is gnuism when used on the rightside or leftside?
[14:45:39] <tirnanog> hmm. I'm not actually sure.
[14:46:42] <ychaouche> I'm not sure I understand what you mean by \n is gnuism, then use it in your examples
[14:46:54] <ychaouche> what am I missing here ?
[14:47:10] <tirnanog> well, I might actually be wrong. but it definitely isn't in the case of tr.
[14:47:26] <ychaouche> also thanks, it works, I don't remember where I got this habit of using double brackets when using character class (grep, could be ?)
[14:48:18] <tirnanog> so, as far as BRE/ERE is concerned, if you write [,[:space:]], the outer brackets are already present. thus, it knows to treat '[:space:]' as a character class.
[14:48:36] <ychaouche> ah
[14:48:41] <tirnanog> tr is a bit different. one might reasonably think that doubling up the brackets is right but it would then actually match [ and ] too.
[14:55:20] <tirnanog> that being said, tr isn't line-oriented so it probably isn't what you want. I shouldn't make suggestions while still half-asleep.
[15:07:13] <Soliton> \n is POSIX on the regex side.
[15:10:09] <Soliton> weird quoting on  sed  s/[,[[:space:]]]/'\n'/g  btw. quote the whole thing or the shell will try pathname expansion.
[15:10:29] <ychaouche> tirnanog: absolutely not, please do. Thanks for suggesting tr, I like its squeeze option, very useful to clean successive newlines and keep only one.
[15:10:43] <Soliton> tr sounds like a good suggestion though. the task doesn't seem particularly line oriented.
[15:37:19] <Soliton> # sed 's/\(\(\(match[0-9]\{1,\}\).*\)*.\{0,1\}\)*/\3/' <<< 'foo match11 bar match22'
[15:37:20] <shbot> Soliton: match11
[15:37:37] <Soliton> didn't know you can actually do non-greedy matching with BRE.
[15:54:42] <Riviera> Soliton: if i have to cite this sometime,
[15:54:47] <Riviera> Soliton: you're the inventor? :)
[15:55:57] <Soliton> nope, got it from here https://stackoverflow.com/a/39752929 and improved it a bit.
[15:56:33] <Riviera> thank you
[15:56:47] <Soliton> their version requires a character after the match if there is just one match.
[15:57:37] <Riviera> i "often" have situations where i start a sed script with something like
[15:57:41] <Riviera> s/$/./
[15:57:49] <Riviera> to make sure there's a character for stuff like that,
[15:58:09] <Riviera> but right now i am sadly way too busy to understand what's going on, or to make an attempt at least :)
[15:58:24] <Soliton> was easy to just make the character optional here though.
[15:58:42] *** Joins: bomb-on (~bomb-on@user/bomb-on)
[16:00:30] <Soliton> the idea is that the . or now .\{0,1\} matches everything up until the actual match is found. once the actual match is found the .* after it consumes the rest.
[16:01:08] <Soliton> certainly not easy to read so not something to actually use unless you really have to.
[16:16:02] <ychaouche> doesn't \3 mean to print third match ? 
[16:17:04] <Soliton> third capture group
[16:17:14] <Soliton> there is just one match.
