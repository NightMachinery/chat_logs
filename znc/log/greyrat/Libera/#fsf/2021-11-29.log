[00:00:29] <Armand> But, I can already do that on a browser.
[00:00:42] <KE0VVT> Armand: The browser is a proprietary web program.

[00:16:17] <White_Flame> twitch seems pretty overkill for that case, given that basic webrtc demos do the same for basic inter-computer video chat
[00:17:03] <White_Flame> and you also get to enjoy the fun of having your home spycam footage uploaded to some corporate cloud

[00:21:55] <White_Flame> as Noisytoot points out, there are tons of simpler means to accomplish this than going 3rd party video site
[00:22:27] <Armand> I probably missed that.
[00:22:48] <Noisytoot> IceCast
[00:23:20] <White_Flame> or just have an ssh tunnel and poke into things directly :-P

[00:25:24] <Armand> So, I'd have to set up a laptop, buy some 1080p webcams, set up server software, etc, etc..
[00:25:38] <Armand> This doesn't seem "simpler" :P
[00:26:09] <White_Flame> uh, what hardware does your home currently have to upload to twitch?
[00:27:15] <Armand> Currently I'm using a Pixel 2 XL.
[00:27:25] <Armand> .. only webcams I have are crap.
[00:27:31] <White_Flame> so why would you need a webcam/laptop/etc?
[00:28:05] <Armand> Because I don't fancy putting a desktop PC on the dining room table. :P
[00:28:13] <White_Flame> wat
[00:28:15] <White_Flame> I don't get it
[00:28:46] <Armand> Short end: Laptop or desktop, pick one
[00:29:04] <White_Flame> why not use your phone?  it has al the hardware you need
[00:29:14] <White_Flame> what's the fascination with desktop/laptop?
[00:29:21] <Armand> I am using a phone.. 
[00:29:54] <la_mettrie> minicomputer <3
[00:30:01] <White_Flame> it sounds like you have this weird concrete association with phone+twitch as the only phone option
[00:30:11] <Armand> But, I'm not going to start messing around with the phone to get some esoteric, oddball set up working.
[00:30:16] <Armand> Wut?
[00:30:38] <White_Flame> what are you talking about?
[00:30:45] <White_Flame> the browser is fully capable of doing everything you want
[00:31:00] <White_Flame> without uploading to 3rd party police sites
[00:31:03] *** Quits: GNUmoon (~GNUmoon@gateway/tor-sasl/gnumoon) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[00:31:10] <Armand> I don't use police sites.
[00:31:14] <White_Flame> twitch?
[00:31:17] <Armand> I don't have access to those.
[00:31:22] <Armand> You said "Police".
[00:31:29] <Armand> I don't see the false assertion here.
[00:31:31] <White_Flame> I mean, I am being a bit hyperbolic with that, but still, it's appropriate for a channel as this
[00:31:33] <Armand> Ohh, nm
[00:32:05] <White_Flame> simple possibility:  kids turn on radio, twitch ends up banning your account
[00:32:14] <White_Flame> for copyright violation
[00:32:28] <GNUHacker> Emacs Conf 2021 in channel #emacsconf and live stream https://live0.emacsconf.org/main.webm
[00:32:39] <Armand> Oh, that's not possible. :D
[00:32:45] <Armand> 1. No radio.
[00:32:49] <Armand> 2. Audio is muted.
[00:32:56] <Armand> 3. The kids don't have thumbs. :P
[00:33:06] <White_Flame> ah, pets
[00:33:09] <Armand> :)
[00:33:16] <White_Flame> even so, I think it's a crazy overkill & privacy-negative setup
[00:33:51] <Armand> I'm reasonably sure that they aren't showing my home address on the stream. :P
[00:35:22] <Armand> Not even sure I can assess how that's even remotely privacy-related, but.. ehh.
[00:35:35] <Armand> I mean, it's an open stream for anyone to watch.. not just me.
[00:35:49] <White_Flame> a feed of your home to a corporate 3rd party intermediary?
[00:36:04] <White_Flame> and wow, even worse
[00:36:11] <White_Flame> well, ok, I guet it, you don't care about privacy
[00:36:24] <Armand> Again, other people can watch.
[00:36:27] <White_Flame> just kinda against most stances here
[00:36:30] * Armand shrugs.
[00:37:11] <Armand> Ohh! Sorry!! I get it now!
[00:37:17] <Armand> Tinfoil.
[00:37:24] <Armand> Ok, carry on, McDuff.
[00:37:53] <White_Flame> it's about principle, not conspiracy, so I don't appreciate the strawman insults now

[00:38:07] <White_Flame> this whole channel is about principle
[00:38:45] <Armand> Ok, I'm not understanding how, in "principle".. that a live stream of two rabbits relates to "privacy" in any way shape or form.
[00:39:19] <White_Flame> it's one of the reasons people questioned the use of twitch.tv when you brought it up
[00:39:43] <Armand> Sorry.. it's the "reason" part I'm really struggling with.
[00:39:48] <White_Flame> freedom fo the software involved, privacy of your data, control over the feed & deferring to others' terms of service, etc
[00:39:55] <Armand> What "data"?
[00:40:06] <Armand> Junk that's collated for advertising? 
[00:40:08] <Armand> Very meh.
[00:43:09] <Armand> Twitch doesn't have access to any actual sensitive data, so.. I couldn't be less concerned for that.

Some things won't work out of the box, and will require fixing youself - as you're trading convience for freedom.

[15:07:36] <DiffieHellman> For NAS with multiple SATA HDD's, ARM probably isn't too reliable. A core 2 AMD64 CPU on a motherboard with plenty of SATA ports is what I would go for - bonus points for libreboot ofc.
