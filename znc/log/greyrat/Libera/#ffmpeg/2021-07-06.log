[00:28:29] <JEEB> if it's something utilizing swscale, then elenril is working on proper that; there is a nb_slices (debug) option in vf_scale, which may or may not break things for you
[00:29:39] <cmdrmoozy> yeah it seems to be swscale, at least that's the stack gdb reports
[00:30:22] <cmdrmoozy> maybe it's a red herring though, the basic problem is if I encode like this: https://dpaste.org/cyCb I get speed=1.0 (roughly), but lots of dup'ed frames... with vsync = 0, it seems to significantly increase swscale cpu usage for some reason?
[00:31:01] <cmdrmoozy> if I understand correctly, dup'ed frames definitely mean *something* is falling behind :/
[00:31:11] <JEEB> if it's ffmpeg.c telling you that
[00:31:29] <JEEB> it just means that it duplicated frames by itself in its imaginary frame rate sync logic
[00:32:09] <JEEB> to keep some random frame rate it thinks you should be keeping to
[00:32:21] <JEEB> -vsync passthrough just disables that duplication/dropping logic
[00:33:34] *** Quits: Blacker47 (~Blacker47@user/blacker47) (Quit: Life is short. Get a V.90 modem fast!)
[00:33:47] <cmdrmoozy> right, I guess the two pieces I don't understand are, why duplicate anything if speed = 1.0?
[00:34:00] <cmdrmoozy> and, why does -vsync passthrough change the amount of work swscale does?
[00:34:17] <JEEB> speed just more or less tells you the transcoding speed
[00:34:21] <JEEB> not anything else
[00:34:51] <JEEB> so if you are running a live input that you cannot (after a while) process faster than it comes in, and thus you should get stuck at about 1.0
[00:35:09] <cmdrmoozy> right, the source is a webcam
[00:35:30] <cmdrmoozy> so I read 30fps from the webcam, transcode at 1.0x, I should get 30fps out - no need to duplicate anything if transcoding is happening at 1.0x?
[00:35:46] <JEEB> the duplication etc has nothing to do with real time
[00:36:20] *** Joins: thebombzen (~thebombze@71.73.92.220)
[00:36:26] <JEEB> it just looks at the frame timestamps, and looks at the frame rate you've set (if that even gets interpreted by that input module)
[00:36:43] <JEEB> and decides that to run with whatever frame rate it has interpreted you as wanting (which may or may not be what you expect)
[00:37:01] <JEEB> then it has decided based on the frame timestamps that it needs to either duplicate a frame, or to drop it
[00:37:16] <elenril> JEEB: nb_slices is not multithreading
[00:37:25] <JEEB> OK

[13:02:27] <dittid[m]> It looks to me that there's something wrong on the hardware encoding options because apparently it goes up too much in bitrate.
[13:03:34] <dittid[m]> Do the `-cq` and `crf` map the same values? I.e cq = 19 matches more or less crf = 19?

[14:48:59] <danergo> o/
[14:49:38] <danergo> recent msgs had gone away, I must ask my question again, sorry for that -.-
[14:50:42] <danergo> I have my customIO setup. I open a standard H264 stream over RTSP, and put into fragmented mp4 container. output is my custom IO, input is standard (not custom IO).
[14:50:42] <danergo> I have my "writeOutput(void *opaque, uint8_t *buffer, int buffer_size)" function, which prints a line into log.
[14:50:43] <danergo> it seems my "writeOutput" is called only (and really only) at IDR frames so if I set my encoder to create IDR at every second, writeOutput is called at every second
[14:50:43] <danergo> if IDRs are every 10 seconds, writeOutput is called at every 10s
[14:50:44] <danergo> I'm using "av_write_frame", and also tried "av_interleaved_write_frame", both produces the same result
[14:50:44] <danergo> oh, and I also put a log in front of "av_write_frame", and I can see it's called a lot of times (I guess for non-IDR frames)
[14:50:45] <danergo> I think I need to set some flags, to ask "av_write_frame" to really "write" the frame, don't care if it's not an IDR frame.
[14:50:45] <danergo> it seems, when an IDR comes, my "writeOutput" is called, and all the frames are written into it which happened before the current IDR and last IDR.
[14:51:25] <danergo> so:
[14:51:25] <danergo> Encoder: I0-nI1-nI2-nI3-I4-nI5-nI6-nl7-I8
[14:51:26] <danergo> av_write_frame(I0...I8) //all packets
[14:51:26] <danergo> and writeOutput is only called at I0, I4 and I8.
[14:51:27] <danergo> for I0: writes I0
[14:51:27] <danergo> for I4: writes nI1-nI2-nI3-I4
[14:51:28] <danergo> for I8: writes nI5-nI6-nI7-I8
[14:51:28] <danergo> I'd like my writeOutput to be called whatever frequent it can be called. How can I ask this from libav?
[14:51:51] <danergo> thanks a lot

[18:36:07] <DeHackEd> it should stand to reason that you should not be trying to decode all videos at once and feeding them all to the concat filter at the same time
[18:58:28] <blerd> I dont believe I do. I wish there was a concat example somewhere on the internet. I call av_read_frame until returns non-positive number then move to next file. The rest is pretty much the same as the transcode example code. Not sure if there is anything I have to do once the first file is done.  avcodec_receive_frame just returns EAGAIN after the first file. I feel like I might have to close or reset something. or offset the PTS/DTS values.. Although I
[18:58:28] <blerd> would think the concat filter would take care of that for me.
[19:01:35] <DeHackEd> but until the first file is done it doesn't pull frames from the second. and we are talking decompressed frames here. That's like 3 MB per 1080p frame typically. you don't want to be buffering all that in RAM

[21:55:35] <Terrence> Can I ask questions about using the FFmpeg API in this channel?
[21:56:19] <kepstin> Terrence: yep, this is the right place for that.
[21:57:34] <Terrence> Awesome! So say I have an audio file, do you happen to know how I can incorporate using "aselect" to keep certain segments of the file?
[21:57:57] <Terrence> http://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/filtering_audio_8c-example.html
[21:58:32] <Terrence> I've already tried using this as a reference and it worked for another filter that I applied on the video but it hasn't worked for aselect to achieve what I want
[21:58:46] <Terrence> kepstin
[22:00:18] <kepstin> if you're already using the api, it's probably more work to set up the whole filter chain and aselect than to just write code yourself that picks for each frame being copied/converted whether to keep it or discard it.
[22:02:09] *** Quits: Brocker (~NoBody@user/brocker) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:02:56] <Terrence> Okay here's the thing with that, I know exactly which frames that I want to keep using the filter I already have
[22:03:13] <Terrence> So how would I use each of those AVFrames to create a new wave file?
[22:03:22] <Terrence> kepstin
[22:03:51] <kepstin> well, you know in your code where you pass the frames to the encoder?
[22:03:58] *** Joins: lille_bitte_ven (~LilleVen@83-91-97-60-cable.dk.customer.tdc.net)
[22:03:59] <kepstin> if it's a frame you don't want to keep, then don't do that
[22:04:55] <Terrence> I haven't incorporated an encoder into my code
[22:05:31] <kepstin> well, if you want to write to a new wav file, then you'll need an encoder and muxer. there's examples for that, or reference the transcodeing example for something more complete.
[22:05:49] *** Joins: Brocker (~NoBody@user/brocker)
[22:06:47] <Terrence> Or wait a second, is there a way to just remove the frame from the AVFormatContext?
[22:07:06] <Terrence> kepstin
[22:07:28] <Terrence> And then I can reconvert the AVFormatContext back to a wav file
[22:07:33] <kepstin> not sure what you mean, that doesn't make any sense
[22:07:43] <Terrence> Okay
[22:07:47] <kepstin> the demuxer/decoder and encoder/muxer need separate contexts
[22:08:19] <kepstin> you demux a file, which gives you packets, you decode them which gives you frames. then you give the frames to an encoder, which gives you packets, which you give to the muxer which puts them into a file format
[22:08:36] <kepstin> in between the decode and encode steps, you can do whatever you want with the frames
[22:08:44] <kepstin> including just throwing some of them out

[22:17:36] <kepstin> i think that's pretty much where you'd do it, yeah. hard to say how that will interact with the rest of your code, since you also need to be decoding frames and passing them to the filter chain somewhere in your loop
[22:18:22] <kepstin> but yeah, after getting a frame out from the filter chain, you can use the state to decide whether to send the frame to the encoder or not.
[22:18:53] <Terrence> I'm just confused how to incorporate it then
[22:19:06] <Terrence> I know that you said look at the example but its not really clear to me what's happening
[22:20:04] *** Joins: dreamon (~dreamon@p57a4cca5.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[22:20:24] <Terrence> So before we get into technical side, just for me to understand from a theocratical stand point
[22:20:35] <Terrence> 1. Decide which frames I want (Done)
[22:20:41] <Terrence> 2. Pass to encoder
[22:20:46] <Terrence> 3. Decode the filter (?)
[22:21:04] <Terrence> 4. Mux into audio file (?)
[22:21:26] <Terrence> Can you confirm if that the process that needs to happen in order for this to work?
[22:21:46] <kepstin> in order, you need to read packet from input format, send to decoder, read from decoder, send to filter chain input, read from filter chain output, decide whether to keep or not, send to encoder, read from encoder, send to output format.
[22:22:24] <Terrence> Oh okay
[22:22:46] <Terrence> So I'm on the "decide whether to keep or not" state, correct?
[22:23:07] <kepstin> there's some complications in that - for example, you need to read from the decoder in a loop since it's possible for the decoder to output multiple frames for a single packet.
[22:23:11] <kepstin> but that's the basic flow
[22:24:13] <Terrence> I'm not sure if I'm over complicating things or not

[22:51:41] <Terrence> Wait question kepstin, so after I'm able to figure out how to get avcodec_send_frame() to work, will it output the new wave file?
[22:52:14] <kepstin> that gives the avframes to the encoder, you still need to get the encoded packets out of the encoder and pass them to the output format
[22:52:32] <kepstin> this is basically the same process you're already using for decoding, but in reverse
[22:54:29] <Terrence> Ah okay, appreciate you for the help. Just trying to get the planning phase done before I get to coding to save as much time as possible
[22:54:50] <Terrence> So as I'm reading through the encoding example there's one question I do have

[22:55:22] <Terrence>     }
[22:55:33] <Terrence> Is there a specific encoder I need for WAVE files?
[22:55:37] <Terrence> kepstin
[22:56:08] <JEEB> you can utilize the same from the input file's AVStream's codecpar
[22:56:53] <JEEB> anyways, if you're just dealing with WAV files if you are OK with being coarse, just read packets and write packets into a wave avformat context? (and skip those packets that you don't require in the output)
[22:57:25] <JEEB> of course if you have actual compressed audio and/or you want to be more precise, then going the decoding & re-encoding way is better
[22:57:45] <kepstin> JEEB: they're using filters to detect features of the decoded streams to decide what to keep or not
[22:57:51] <JEEB> ah
[22:57:55] <JEEB> then yes, needs decoding :P
[22:58:11] <Terrence> Yes
[22:58:13] <JEEB> since filters utilize AVFrames, and AVFrames go through decoding, even if that is minimal in case of raw audio
[22:58:17] <JEEB> (which WAV usually has)
[22:59:00] <Terrence> So wait JEEB you kinda just confused me, I'm not using an AVStream
[22:59:35] <Terrence> I'm using an IStream with audio data, I can to create a Custom IO Context for it
[22:59:58] <Terrence> However, it is a wave file I know for sure
[23:00:02] <JEEB> uhh, so your input is not WAV?
[23:00:20] <JEEB> the IO layer doesn't really matter, as long as you have an input avformat context, you have AVStreams
