[11:31:38] <checkbot> pj: I think the problem is on line 375. Expanding an array without an index only gives the first element. See 9 issues on https://shellcheck.net/?id=cb5298
[11:32:01] <pj> oh, bleh, I need to run that script through shellcheck again, lol
[11:32:47] <pj> anyways, note that even though it's a bash script I have to make the first check POSIX sh-compatible because I'm explicitly checking for someone running it stupidly in sh.
[11:33:33] <llua> can't stop stupid
[11:33:58] <pj> lol, nope, but you can point fingers at it and laugh.
[11:35:13] <pj> llua: I actually was getting a number of complaints about it until I put that check in, and believe it or not, even after putting that check in I had someone complain that it wouldn't run until they commented out those lines (the check) and then it had further problems!
[11:36:14] <llua> considering the intention of the script, when would a centos 8 system not have bash > 4.2
[11:37:18] <llua> el8*
[11:38:50] <llua> (i understand checking for bash, just the version number requirement was interesting)

[11:51:05] <pj> llua: it should always have 4.4, but then you never know what kind of stupid people will do, like trying an unsupported upgrade from CentOS 6 to CentOS 8 and then migrating to RockyLinux when it still has the older bash version, or trying to install an older bash from source for whatever stupid reason, etc.
[11:52:47] <pj> You'll note that I'm also checking for the existence of a bunch of external commands that the script should be using as well, but every single one of those commands will be on a minimal EL8 system (I made sure of it).
[11:53:05] <pj> ...except for the EFI ones but all of those will be in an EFI-boot system.

[14:29:16] <earnestly> (Attaching strace would make it very slow)
[14:29:23] <olspookishmagus> what do you mean by "poll"?
[14:29:49] <olspookishmagus> ok I guess the trick then is to be suspicious of what might be time consuming and be ready for it beforehand
[14:30:03] <olspookishmagus> capture it's output, monitor it's progress etc etc
[14:30:38] <geirha> Might be able to get the info by tracing it with strace, but that may be a lot of extra work

[14:47:01] <olspookishmagus> I will most probably write a script in the USB disk I mount that it will do those stuff but I was wondering if there's a way to have that happen if I forget about it of if it takes a lot longer that I anticipated

[19:31:05] <concrete-houses> see the -X is shell not http
[19:31:13] <concrete-houses> its a path to ignore
[19:31:14] <ede> For example, 上海+中國 in UTF-8 would be URL-encoded as %E4%B8%8A%E6%B5%B7%2B%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B.
[19:31:14] <ede> The string ? and the Mysterians would be URL-encoded as %3F+and+the+Mysterians or %3F%20and%20the%20Mysterians.
[19:31:38] <ede> so %xx%xx%xx etc. using the UTF-8 representation
[19:32:06] <concrete-houses> public/Books/rpg.rem.uz/Pathfinder/3rd Party/one/ ok how write that
[19:33:05] <ede> getting around fs limits is another rabbit hole. DOS (not sure about windows these days) ALWAYS wanted something in front of the '.', also files couldn't end in '.'
[19:34:01] <ede> in the end it depends on the file systems you may want to use the file, else you'd have to translate it again, possibly breaking consistency.
[19:34:36] <concrete-houses> hmm
[19:34:53] <concrete-houses> its about coxing wget to leave out that one directory 
[19:34:59] <ede> that's an encoded filename in /dev/disk → Linux\x20filesystem
[19:35:00] <concrete-houses> coaxing
[19:35:37] <concrete-houses> wget has some regex ignore but I am not strong in regex
[19:35:41] <concrete-houses> hmm
[19:35:59] <ede> sometimes it's just easier to use -O and then fixing things instead of checking the URL and the resulting filename, sometimes it's impossible

[19:37:28] <concrete-houses> this works I guess -X accepts *
[19:37:50] <ede> like when you have some/x/path/with/y/variable/parts/z.foo. with a small alphabet for z and y rotating fast and x changing sometimes you'd save yourself a lot of hassle maybe by constructing the URL in a script and not using the name delivered by the server

[19:38:17] <concrete-houses> what is the -O again?
[19:38:44] <ede> like packages from github are always something.zip, but the name is taken from the header (at least i told wget to do so iirc)
[19:38:56] <concrete-houses> ok
[19:38:58] <ede> uses whatever the server somehow says is the filename
[19:39:13] <concrete-houses> well I have the working solution now I am so relieved

[19:39:33] <ede> that's say index.html for options/index.html, but header may say it's options.html, which would be used then
[19:40:39] <ede> everything ending in "....one/ is.
[19:40:49] <concrete-houses> so take what webserver gives then split it up and rearange it

[23:26:21] <zeamp> Is there a way to make a text-based menu system within bash to execute certain commands (without escaping to the "full" shell)?
[23:26:53] <zeamp> Not a chroot so to speak. Just a display with a few menu commands, arrow up down, enter, etc. Maybe I'm thinking of nucrses?
[23:27:15] <zeamp> Or maybe I'm thinking of both a chroot + menu system....?
[23:27:48] <zeamp> After migrating my last FreeBSD server to Debian (FBSD 3.x-12.x), I decided to ditch zsh and return to bash. But I've forgotten nearly all my bash knowledge these past 21 years.
[23:28:17] <zeamp> Thank you for listening to my TED Talk.

[23:31:38] <ormaaj> I see tmux has a funny right clicky menu thing now. I wonder if that's abusable by other utilities.
