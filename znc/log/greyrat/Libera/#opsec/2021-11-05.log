[03:39:13] <Joanna> They probably like free code that they can modify. Like when the got ahold of decentralized skype code written in pascal and redid it.
[03:39:34] <Joanna> That wasn‚Äôt free though..

[05:31:46] <s1gyn> ms is nicer now
[05:32:06] <Joanna> It is ??
[05:32:14] <Joanna> :)
[05:32:57] <Joanna> Hi s1gyn what‚Äôs new?
[05:33:34] <s1gyn> Studying for the General level amateur radio licence exam.
[05:33:58] <Joanna> Like ham radio?
[05:34:08] <s1gyn> They are reintroducing the licence fees at somepoint next year, so I figured I should get off my butt and upgrade my licence before then
[05:34:09] <s1gyn> yeah
[05:34:49] <Joanna> I never knew those required a test
[05:36:01] <s1gyn> Yeah there are three levels each with a progessively more difficult test.
[05:36:30] <Joanna> What do you need to know for it?
[05:37:54] *** Joins: moose (~moose@user/moose)
[05:38:14] <s1gyn> Regulations, theory and practical stuff. So like right now I'm studying antenna theory.
[05:41:22] <Joanna> Do you make your own antenna ?
[05:41:50] <s1gyn> You can
[05:42:10] <s1gyn> Usually even if you make it yourself, you base it on a design someone smart came up with
[05:42:45] <s1gyn> That's what I did.
[05:44:00] <Joanna> Have you ever heard of antennas using fractals?
[05:46:25] <s1gyn> No I had not until you mentioned it just now.
[05:46:28] <s1gyn> Interesting
[05:46:39] <s1gyn> Pain in the ass to make though :D
[05:46:58] <s1gyn> It's not like my wire antenna wasn't when it really comes down to it
[05:47:38] <s1gyn> I drove an 8 foot copper ground rod into the ground, dug like 9 trenches out from it a couple inches deep and layed wire in them, connected back at the rod.
[05:47:42] <s1gyn> So that's my ground system
[05:47:46] <Joanna> The fractal ones can be much more compact I‚Äôve heard
[05:48:27] <Joanna> Why is it buried ?
[05:48:47] <Joanna> Lightning strikes ?
[05:50:09] <s1gyn> Then I attached a halyard to the sat dish mast on the corner of my two story house. My and my father in-law tossed rope over it while standing on the shed. Then I built a mast to hold up the other end of the antenna drove guy stakes and three tiers of guy ropes to hold up a big painter's pole anchored in a pipe buried in quickcrete. Then I suspended the wire antenna between the house and the mast.
[05:50:46] <s1gyn> Nah, it's because I need a good ground, especially since I live in the desert and the soil is not very conductive
[05:51:24] <s1gyn> So I built this: http://www.g7fek.co.uk/blogus/newsshow.php?page=G7FEK_Limited_space_anten_29507
[05:51:26] <SeaDough> ^ G7FEK Limited space antenna comes of age. | G7FEK Amateur Radio
[05:51:40] <s1gyn> only with a traditional radial ground system rather than a counterpoise
[05:56:15] <Joanna>  That‚Äôs interesting stuff. Reminds me of musical instruments with strings like harp.
[05:56:50] <Joanna> I saw part were you have to be careful about length of the wires
[06:01:51] <Joanna> In fact there was a project with antennas called HARP in Alaska..

[06:23:15] <Joanna> Hmm
[06:23:35] <Joanna> Your nick is interesting we could start wth that
[06:24:13] <B4ckBOne> Is John too general?

[06:24:32] <B4ckBOne> :D
[06:25:00] <Joanna> That might be American slang though
[06:25:50] <Joanna> So how long have you been interested in security and do you have any interesting insights?
[06:26:30] <B4ckBOne> I can not answer this question at this point in time. 
[06:26:37] <B4ckBOne> How am i doing?

[06:34:32] <B4ckBOne> Yes
[06:34:48] <B4ckBOne> My interests might not align with the norm.
[06:34:55] <Joanna> Why this network in particular?
[06:35:10] <B4ckBOne> Freenode was shut down.
[06:35:12] <Joanna> Are you paid influencer ?
[06:35:24] <Joanna> It definitely was
[06:35:33] <B4ckBOne> Yes, but not in the way you might think.
[06:35:58] <B4ckBOne> Anyone with a job might be an influencer
[06:36:28] <Joanna> Freenode was destroyed on purpose so far as I can tell
[06:37:20] <Joanna> Anyone can be an influencer if people value their opinions
[06:37:33] <B4ckBOne> Sentiment was changed. Not sure about the background and all.
[06:38:10] <B4ckBOne> However there are many networks to chat on. 
[06:38:21] <B4ckBOne> This one has lots of overlap with my interests.
[06:38:59] <Joanna> What are your interests?
[06:40:26] <B4ckBOne> Now if i would tell yout hat, then it would be easy to engineer information to puppet me.
[06:40:42] <B4ckBOne> Wouldnt that compromise my #opsec ?
[06:41:32] <B4ckBOne> However i should probably construct a character that is interestingly enough for you to engage with me. 
[06:41:34] <Joanna> Maybe..
[06:41:41] <B4ckBOne> So i can gain information about you.
[06:42:06] <Joanna> I‚Äôm not very interesting I‚Äôm afraid:)
