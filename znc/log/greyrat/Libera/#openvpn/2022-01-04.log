[01:15:26] <heffay> Very new to openvpn here, and wondering something. Was offsite and connected to my home server @ 10.0.0.10 via openvpn no problem. The next day I couldn't connect to my home server and discovered there was a machine that had joined the offsite network with the address 10.0.0.10 so I assume there was a conflict.

[01:17:12] <heffay> I was under the impression that while connected to my home network via openvpn I wouldn't see machines on my local, offsite network.
[01:29:55] <rob0> you have to be able to connect to a VPN with regular networking connections
[01:31:39] <rob0> and if you're using the same RFC 1918 networks for different places, you made a mistake
[01:32:08] <rob0> don't choose common 1918 netblocks

[10:44:11] <pagios> what does destination  0/1 means when i do a netstat -rn  ? is it default gateway? coz i have an open vpn open
[10:44:13] <pagios> on mac
[11:17:08] *** Quits: carbolymer (~carbolyme@dropacid.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[11:18:42] <ordex> pagios: that is half of the default route. I would guess you have openvpn configured with 'redirect-gateway def1'. the 'def1' part is what tells openvpn to install that 0.0.0.0/1 and the 127.0.0.0/1
[11:28:01] <pagios> ordex: what is meant by half default route?
[11:28:45] <pagios> how does it decide if it should go over that route or the default one when it is half
[11:30:13] *** Joins: Snegodick (~ne@user/Snegodick)
[11:30:48] <ordex> pagios: the explanation is in the second part of my sentence
[11:30:54] <ordex> there are two routes with /1 installed
[11:31:04] <ordex> the two of them together make the full default route
[11:31:17] <ordex> the manpage explains what happens with 'def1' - you could read that to better understand
[11:31:17] <pagios> yes but an application decides to go on a given route?
[11:31:22] <pagios> how does it technically happen
[11:31:33] <ordex> pagios: no, the application does not decide the route to take
[11:31:44] <ordex> pagios: do you know how routing normally works (without a VPN) ?
[11:32:32] <pagios> yes sure
[11:32:48] <pagios> 0/1                10.80.0.1           UGScg           utun3
[11:32:48] <pagios> default            10.57.128.1        UGScg             en0
[11:32:52] <pagios> i have those 
[11:33:02] <ordex> there is another /1 route in your table
[11:33:02] <pagios> i am not sure when the 0/1 is picked up 
[11:33:24] <ordex> pagios: when the destination address falls into 0.0.0.0/1 (0/1 is just a ugly visual shortcut)
[11:33:35] <pagios> i have a 128.0/1
[11:33:38] <ordex> yap
[11:33:45] <ordex> ugly visual shortcut for 128.0.0.0/1
[11:34:00] <pagios> and 0/1 is shortcute for what
[11:34:04] <ordex> 128.0.0.0/1 + 0.0.0.0/1 == 0.0.0.0/0 (default route basically)
[11:34:10] <ordex> read above
[11:34:17] <ordex> "0.0.0.0/1 (0/1 is just a ugly visual shortcut)"
[11:34:56] <pagios> default            10.30.128.1
[11:35:05] <ordex> that's your original default route, I presume
[11:35:08] <pagios> default is 0.0.0.0/0 too no ? 
[11:35:11] <ordex> yes
[11:35:33] <ordex> so 0.0.0.0/1 and 128.0.0.0/1 are *more* specific than 0.0.0.0/0
[11:35:43] <pagios> ok so how does routing happen here? how will the routing protocol decide to go over default or 0.0.0.0/1
[11:35:47] <pagios> ok
[11:35:47] <ordex> routing in the internet works by longest prefix matching
[11:35:57] <pagios> so 0.0.0.0/1 will get a priority
[11:35:58] <ordex> (this is unrelated to vpn/openvpn)
[11:36:00] <ordex> yes
[11:36:17] <ordex> 0.0.0.0/1 and 128.0.0.0/1 catch the whole IPv4 space
[11:36:24] <pagios> ok so as long as my vpn is up, the default will go to 0.0.0.0/1 => vpn 
[11:36:28] <ordex> and by being more specific than 0.0.0.0/0, they are preferred
[11:36:33] <pagios> yea
[11:36:39] <ordex> either 0.0.0.0/1 or 128.0.0.0/1
[11:36:45] <ordex> one of those will match
[11:36:57] <ordex> and the default/0.0.0.0 route will be ignored, as less specific
[11:36:57] <pagios> both are going to utun3 interface
[11:37:11] <ordex> right, to the vpn
[11:37:19] <pagios> ok i can then assume that as long as i have a vpn opened, all my traffic will go to the vpn
[11:37:43] <ordex> well, there can be other mechanisms on a system that make take traffic somewhere else
[11:37:46] <ordex> so I cannot guarantee
[11:37:49] <ordex> but most likely yes
[11:37:51] <pagios> when the vpn is disocnnected, the route 0.0.0./1 and 128 willbe removed
[11:37:55] <ordex> correct
[11:38:05] <ordex> this is the "rdirect-gateway def1" behaviour
[11:38:08] <ordex> you can check the manpage
[11:38:08] <pagios> nice :)
[11:38:13] <ordex> *redirect
[11:38:17] <pagios> thanks for this ordex
[11:38:21] <ordex> np
[11:38:22] <ordex> !
[11:38:53] <pagios> curious to know about those other machanism that makes traffic go somewhere else
[11:39:36] <ordex> i.e. policy routing
[11:39:40] <ordex> firewall marking
[11:39:42] <ordex> etc..
[11:40:01] <ordex> with policy routing you may instruct your traffic to use an entirely different routing table
[11:40:18] <ordex> where you may have another default route :)
[11:41:57] <pagios> policy routing mainly changes the desitnation ip i guess righT? so that it tricks the default route to go somewhere else
[11:42:08] <pagios> or changes the src ip  can work too
[11:42:44] <ordex> none of them
[11:42:51] <ordex> it's routing, so does not mangles packets
[11:47:29] <pagios> how would a policy routing look like? policy on what params
[12:02:41] <ordex> pagios: I'd suggest to use google at this point :D
[12:04:07] <pagios> deal :)
[12:06:10] <pagios> ordex: why is it a half route btw why not a full route of 0.0.0.0/1 
[12:06:19] <pagios> ah coz you need to give it a priority by making it longer
[12:06:36] <ordex> yap
[12:06:50] <ordex> the alternative is to remove the current default route and to install a new one
[12:07:00] <ordex> but this is problematic sometimes
[12:07:12] <ordex> (and this is actually the default behaviour when no def1 keyword is specified)
[12:07:32] <ordex> so keeping the original default route and installing these two routes is preferred

[23:20:43] <tharkun> Good $DAY I am setting up openvpn on a multiclient environment. All clients are able to connect without any problem, but when I attempt to do service openvpn start the server starts and on the next second it stops. I am unable to figure out why openvpn /etc/openvpn/server.conf does the trick while the service openvpn does not. Any ideas on how to debug it. I tried verb = 6 so I could have any usefull 
[23:20:49] <tharkun> information on /var/log/syslog to no avail.
[23:22:14] <colo> what distro are you on?
[23:22:23] <colo> does it not use systemd?
[23:24:21] <tharkun> colo: Debian
[23:24:43] <colo> Debian 11? or an older release? did you upgrade from an earlier version?
[23:24:59] <tharkun> debian 10 for I what just learned :D
[23:25:29] <tharkun> Anyway openvpn --daemon server.conf does not do the trick either.
[23:25:32] <colo> try looking at   sudo journalctl -u openvpn\* -n200
[23:29:13] <ordex> tharkun: that syntax is invalid. I think it should be openvpn --daemon --config server.conf
[23:29:26] <Pippin_> https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/tree/master/distro/systemd
[23:29:58] <colo> Pippin_, afair, Debian does not use these
[23:30:34] <colo> (Debian 10. they might be what Debian 11's service units are based on.)
[23:30:37] <tharkun> The one liner states that the daemon is running but there is no listener on udp port: 1194 running nor any tun device
[23:58:38] <ordex> tharkun: which one line? and pasting the log might be more useful
