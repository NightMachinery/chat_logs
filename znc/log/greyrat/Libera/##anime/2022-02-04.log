[00:37:27] <emmeka> unorgaacount Discord is proprietary software that offers no anonymity and spoonfeeds everything to a company that is probably selling all your datameats. Also, it's terrible bloatware.

[07:37:27] <ButterNoodle> its been probably 10 years since he died
[07:38:07] <ButterNoodle> he felt like a burden to his parents bc one day he was making 6 figures.. and all he could do was actually bag groceries..
[07:39:06] <ButterNoodle> dont remember all the details.. was sorting out my own life at the time.. but just goes to show u that life can fuck u in the ass.. be ready to jump or lube up
[07:40:02] <ButterNoodle> thanks Roey.. we werent close, but its one of those stories where the worst things happen.. makes me try to prepare for something like that
[07:40:46] <ButterNoodle> like my cousin.. just announced that his 2nd wife is divorcing him.. sounds like he found christ and is trying to be a good person, and she is jealous
[07:41:21] * ButterNoodle is ready to pop smoke and gtfo in 12hrs if shit goes down
[07:41:36] * MootPoot can pop smoke and leave in 1 hour
[07:41:45] * MootPoot realizes he has nowhere to go to
[07:41:46] <MootPoot> nvm
[07:41:53] <ButterNoodle> I have 3 safes and a datacenter in the basement to load up
[07:42:09] <ButterNoodle> maybe a dozen cats
[07:42:28] <MootPoot> these gyroball things seems kinda cool
[07:42:30] <MootPoot> tbh
[07:42:32] <Roey> ButterNoodle: aye
[07:42:41] <MootPoot> !g gyroball exerciser
[07:42:43] <ButterNoodle> cats man

[07:42:47] <ButterNoodle> they will never fuck u
[07:42:51] <ButterNoodle> they will never leave u
[07:42:52] <MootPoot> they will
[07:43:03] <MootPoot> my cat teabagged me once in my sleep
[07:43:09] <Roey> ButterNoodle: btw, my cousin killed himself last year -- I wasn't close with him but I was close with his mom
[07:43:13] <MootPoot> smacked his nuts down right on my face
[07:43:14] <ButterNoodle> no stupid.. they are just waiting for u to die so they can eat you
[07:43:33] <ButterNoodle> Roey: suicide fucking hits hard man
[07:43:37] <Sapphirus> All my cat does is bring his tennis ball to me.
[07:43:38] <Roey> and although I am not intending to compare his death to that of your cousin'
[07:43:40] <MootPoot> I can report cat balls feel like small caterpillars on your face
[07:43:51] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: why did u let him keep his nuts.. now u his bitch
[07:43:57] <Roey> I needed to vent about this because it made me feel shitty for not having contacted him
[07:43:59] <MootPoot> the furry caterpillars
[07:43:59] <Roey> before he did it.
[07:44:01] <Roey> he was only 20
[07:44:06] <Roey> ButterNoodle: yeah
[07:44:43] <ButterNoodle> Roey: family deaths whether they are suicide or not kinda hurt.. bc u think about missed conversations and such
[07:44:50] <Roey> yeah
[07:44:57] <Roey> and how so-and-so didn't see the rise of President Whoever
[07:44:58] <MootPoot> I want food but not sure what to get
[07:45:11] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: mexican cock biscuits
[07:45:15] <MootPoot> probably just get more salad and mayo
[07:45:21] <MootPoot> then pair that with chicken like always
[07:45:28] <ButterNoodle> Roey: I regret not spending more time w my dad before he died
[07:45:38] <ButterNoodle> at least in his good years
[07:45:50] <ButterNoodle> cancer killed him fast
[07:46:44] <Roey> :((((((((((((((
[07:47:00] <Roey> how long ago did he pass, ButterNoodle?

[07:48:47] <Roey> I'm 41
[07:48:52] <Roey> I'm at the age where I'm worrying about my parents
[07:48:55] <Roey> they're worrying about me
[07:48:56] <MootPoot> well, hasen't happened here yet but
[07:49:00] <Roey> everyone is worrying about everyone else.
[07:49:01] <ButterNoodle> call them often
[07:49:07] <MootPoot> afaik you do realize you're "really" alone 
[07:49:12] <MootPoot> once your mom and pops are gone
[07:49:13] <ButterNoodle> and say what u need to say..
[07:49:22] <ButterNoodle> and listen
[07:49:25] <Roey> ButterNoodle: I drink coffee with them every morning at their house.  I drive to their place every morning specifically to do that
[07:49:32] <Roey> ButterNoodle: yeah?
[07:49:36] <ButterNoodle> ur lucky..
[07:49:59] <ButterNoodle> I didnt have much to do with my parents for years bc my wife and mom didnt get along..
[07:50:05] <Roey> !!!!! :(((
[07:50:09] <ButterNoodle> so
[07:50:24] <ButterNoodle> I became pretty bitter
[07:50:40] <Roey> understandable
[07:50:41] <ButterNoodle> and a tad bit resentful
[07:50:44] <ButterNoodle> so
[07:50:51] <ButterNoodle> thats why I do what I want these days

[07:51:51] <Roey> also--the reason I don't move anywhere else is because I fucking *need* to be within 20 mins of my parents
[07:51:57] <Roey> otherwise, fuck, I'll move to Israel and that's that.
[07:52:01] <ButterNoodle> yea gonna suck to move to tx

[07:58:25] * ButterNoodle chuggs the can of CS and pukes in C
[07:58:26] <jessedesu_onaph> I'm going to a glaive concert this saturday
[07:58:27] <MootPoot> I'm not too good at them
[07:58:33] <Roey> MootPoot: where they show you problemsfrom real interviews
[07:58:39] <Roey> MootPoot: just do more nad more, yhou'll get your grooe
[07:58:41] <Roey> groove*
[07:58:52] <MootPoot> I've mostly done like ( building platforms/software ) rather then those code test things
[07:58:56] <Roey> MootPoot: my brother introduced me to it.  He said, do 200.
[07:58:59] <Roey> (serious)
[07:59:05] <Roey> do 200, then you'll be a master.
[07:59:10] <MootPoot> I can barely get past the first few lol
[07:59:11] <MootPoot> :3
[07:59:26] <Roey> :) well, they do have different levels of difficulty
[07:59:27] <MootPoot> but I can tell you how to architect a application, deploy and maintain it 
[07:59:30] <jessedesu_onaph> :3
[07:59:31] <Roey> :)
[07:59:38] <jessedesu_onaph> :[
[07:59:41] <Roey> MootPoot: are you a linux user? python user?
[07:59:51] <ButterNoodle> Roey: I gottem on the arch
[08:00:02] <MootPoot> the thing with me being "applied" CS - they entirely focued on building things rather then knowing the ins and outs of code
[08:00:05] * Roey hugs jessedesu_onaph :) hey man what's up? not feeling well?  WTF (why the face)?
[08:00:19] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: I cant arch that far
[08:00:48] <Roey> i'm sure you'll arch ur way to the top
[08:01:23] <MootPoot> only thing I want to do right now is just get a job - build some experience and help me pops pay off the house
[08:01:39] <MootPoot> then I'll consider setting out solo when I'm about to hit 30 or someth
[08:02:35] <Roey> :)
[08:02:43] <Roey> do it!!! you'll save so much money
[08:02:50] <Roey> although you need to live your life an d grow up, as well
[08:02:56] <MootPoot> I'm already living with them - plan to do that for a while
[08:03:00] <Roey> i moved out of my parents house at age 26, myself
[08:03:16] <MootPoot> imo this is growing up - bigger responsibilites then fucking off my by self and then wasting money on rent
[08:03:19] <Roey> 23 came home from college, lived there 3 years till I was about to go fucking nuts
[08:03:19] <MootPoot> imo
[08:03:29] <Roey> found an apartment closer to the city and moved there
[08:03:32] <MootPoot> my parents are pretty chill 
[08:03:48] <Roey> MootPoot: also at some point you'll start feeling like a you're a tick sucking their money
[08:03:54] <Roey> MootPoot: do you have sibligns?
[08:04:09] <MootPoot> oh, no, I KNOW I'm a tick sucking their money :3
[08:04:11] <MootPoot> I'm okay with it
[08:04:18] <Roey> MootPoot: also at some point you'll start feeling like a you and your siblings are ticks sucking their money
[08:04:19] <MootPoot> its what they signed up for when they had me
[08:04:20] <Roey> heh
[08:04:25] <Roey> MootPoot: <3 <3 <3
[08:04:39] <Roey> MootPoot: my mom, when I said that to her, that I feel that way and that I hate it,
[08:04:43] <MootPoot> although I do aim to help out in kind, but at the same time that's what they signed up for
[08:04:47] <Roey> MootPoot: she said "not in this house, you're not ticks"
[08:04:47] <MootPoot> so they can suck it

[08:20:17] <Roey> amigojapan: he got really popular, now has over a million subscribers, he's been on television talk shows, and he has a course for learning Chinese that he sells on his web site.  He's now married, and his son was recently born

[08:20:43] <amigojapan> Roey: I did not hear him speak Japanese, in Spanish he seems semi conventional but lacks vocab. Like he did not know "pasear
[08:22:05] <amigojapan> Roey: I can't judge Chinese
[08:23:29] <Roey> amigojapan: ahhh ok
[08:23:43] <Roey> amigojapan: I mean considering how he learned it in such a short time, heh
[08:24:48] <Roey> amigojapan: so, he prides himself on his Chinese ability.  He meets with Chinese language coaches, and they give him pointers on how to improve it further

[09:22:43] <ButterNoodle> I just realized that I havent updated mal in a long time
[09:22:45] <amigojapan> RetroNed: I don't tend to watch much modern stuff
[09:22:49] <ButterNoodle> because I dont like them
[09:22:55] <ButterNoodle> RetroNed: I watch a lot of stuff
[09:23:20] <RetroNed> I'll watch whatever I can get my hands on most of the time.
[09:23:32] <amigojapan> RetroNed: what is your favourite anime is all time?
[09:24:11] *** Joins: Mr_Misery (~weechat@110.44.125.182)
[09:24:38] <RetroNed> It's hard for me to tell for sure. My first taste of anime was To Love-Ru and Mahou Sensei Negima.
[09:24:52] <ButterNoodle> hakozume is fun
[09:25:07] <RetroNed> Digimon Adventure will always hold a soft spot in my heart too.
[09:25:31] <ButterNoodle> arifureta is good
[09:25:37] <amigojapan> RetroNed: my favourite anime is sailor moon
[09:25:39] <ButterNoodle> I'm too old to like digimon

[09:26:21] <RetroNed> I've been keeping up with more modern stuff too, and Arifureta is just not to my tastes.
[09:26:29] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I did watch a Digimon movie in the US, but I did not like it that much
[09:27:24] <RetroNed> I went back and binge-watched the whole series with my girlfriend a while back for the release of Last Evolution Kizuna. It was kinda fun to turn our brains off and enjoy it.
[09:28:13] <RetroNed> As much as I enjoy the convenience of streaming, nothing beats popping a new tape into my video cassette player.

[09:30:04] <RetroNed> Occasionally at Comic Con, they'll sell reproduction tapes of old series, or even the original box sets used.
[09:30:20] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[09:30:31] <RetroNed> Ah, good luck on that!
[09:31:07] <RetroNed> I only was able to get into Sailor Moon a while back, and forgot to finish it halfway through.
[09:31:37] <amigojapan> Yeah. I have been lucky going to "hard off" and finding sailor moon lasers discs
[09:31:52] <RetroNed> I'd love to get a full series of Dragon Ball VHS tapes.
[09:32:02] <amigojapan> RetroNed: the last arc is the best part
[09:32:14] <RetroNed> I'll hop back on it then!
[09:32:49] <amigojapan> :)
[09:33:30] <RetroNed> From the older stuff I've seen, I remember liking Chobits for a while as well.
[09:33:43] <amigojapan> RetroNed: skip the first 8 episodes of stars, then it really starts
[09:33:49] <RetroNed> Recently got into Lupin the Third on top of that.
[09:34:13] <RetroNed> Gotcha! Will do!
[09:34:23] <amigojapan> :)
[09:34:35] <RetroNed> I've got to grab myself a Sony Watchman.
[09:35:14] <amigojapan> Is that a TV watch?
[09:35:17] <RetroNed> At the moment when I go on trips, I bring a 3" B/W CRT with me, and I need to have something in color for a better experience.
[09:36:39] <RetroNed> It's nice, but not ideal.
[09:36:53] <RetroNed> A nice PVM is the goal though!
[09:37:45] <amigojapan> Ah ok I saw a picture
[09:37:56] <RetroNed> Yep!
[09:38:16] <RetroNed> The Sony Watchman is pretty great.
[09:38:42] <amigojapan> I know the Walkman but I did not know the Watchman
[09:39:13] <RetroNed> Back before digital, you could watch all the local channels on the go, but now it's best for portable retro gaming.
[09:39:36] <amigojapan> Right
[09:40:53] <RetroNed> At some point I'd like to see the return of digital portable TVs, but with streaming it's unlikely.
[09:40:55] <amigojapan> RetroNed: I have a Famicom
[09:41:14] <RetroNed> Ah, nice!
[09:42:36] <amigojapan> Someone gave it to me, they were going to throw it away
[09:44:01] <RetroNed> My collection so far is a Sega Genesis, Sega Saturn, Sega Dreamcast, PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, PS5, PS Classic, XBOX, Xbox 360, N64, 2 GameCube, 3 Wii, Wii U, 2 Switch, 2 Gameboy Color, GBA, 2 GBA SP, 2 DS Lite, DSi, DSi XL, 2DS, 2 New 3DSxl, and a $3k Gaming PC.
[09:44:19] <RetroNed> Sick! That's how I got my Gameboy Player for my Gamecube!
[09:44:51] <ketchupicecream2> Wow
[09:45:07] <ketchupicecream2> I had a PSP growing up
[09:45:33] <RetroNed> I'm looking into getting a Famicom and Super Famicom, but I've got a Retron 5 to hold me over until then.
[09:45:56] <RetroNed> I'm looking for a reasonably priced PSP and PS Vita as well too.
[09:46:50] <RetroNed> I've got tons of TVs setup in my room to keep every console connected at once, so that when guests come we can hop from one system to the next!
[09:47:35] <RetroNed> And when it comes to having so many retro consoles, Flash Carts are your best friend.
[09:47:52] <amigojapan> Nice collection RetroNed 
[09:48:03] <RetroNed> Thank you very much!
[09:48:07] <amigojapan> RetroNed: I have my PS2 and wii
[09:48:24] <RetroNed> Ah, are they modded as well?
[09:48:44] <RetroNed> If not, totally give CTGP a shot.
[09:49:14] <amigojapan> RetroNed: it's a Japanese ps2. Not moded
[09:49:18] <RetroNed> And the English release of Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 4 just came out for the PS2. 
[09:49:39] <RetroNed> Is it a phat, or slim model?
[09:49:54] <amigojapan> Phat
[09:50:08] <amigojapan> Blue
[09:51:03] <RetroNed> Those are slightly more complicated, so if you wanted to run modded games on it you'd need to buy a FreeMCBoot Memory Card for it.
[09:51:38] <amigojapan> I see
[09:52:03] <RetroNed> Meanwhile, even my Grandmother could mod a Wii. If you can microwave food, you can mod a Wii.
[09:52:34] <amigojapan> Hehehe yeah
[09:52:39] <RetroNed> str2hax is so easy to execute.
[09:53:31] <RetroNed> A far cry from my childhood setting up custom stages in Brawl making sure I had all the files right on a 2GB Memory Card.
[09:55:10] <RetroNed> Nowadays when I play with my girlfriend, she prefers I upscale the games to 1080p in Dolphin so we can play the games in HD.
[09:55:34] <amigojapan> RetroNed: I would like to buy a super Famicom
[09:55:49] <ketchupicecream2> upscaled graphics look weird
[09:56:09] <ketchupicecream2> kinds jagged
[09:56:13] <ketchupicecream2> kinda*
[09:56:33] <RetroNed> On the Wii, upscaling doesn't look bad as long as you stick to multiples of the native resolution.
[09:56:40] <yakzy> hola
[09:56:44] <yakzy> hi
[09:56:49] <RetroNed> AI Enhanced Textures are a must too.

[09:57:57] <yakzy> cool!
[09:58:07] <RetroNed> I'm probably a bit better off than most people emulating though with a ASUS Prime B550+, RTX 3070ti, Ryzen 7 5800X, and 32GB of RAM.

[10:01:05] <amigojapan> RetroNed: what was your first computer?
[10:02:10] <RetroNed> My first PC as a Dell Inspiron Mini Laptop running Windows XP with 1GB of RAM.
[10:02:55] <amigojapan> That's pretty modern
[10:03:07] <amigojapan> Guess you are much younger than me
[10:03:44] <amigojapan> My first computer was a 286 with 20mb HDD and 1mb of ram
[10:03:53] <RetroNed> The Inspiron Mini was in 08' and you'd likely be right! I'm only 19.
[10:03:59] <yakzy> i feel retrogamer, my first computer has 1gb of ram too back in 2004
[10:04:22] <yakzy> amigojuan lol that was on 98' or something? i think
[10:04:36] <RetroNed> I don't miss the Intel Atom processor.
[10:04:53] <amigojapan> Mine was in what? Maybe 1990 and I was already like 12 years old

[10:14:44] <Sapphirus> RetroNed, I wonder how anyone is able to get a graphics card. :\
[10:15:08] <RetroNed> You know it! It's the best way to experience older games. Especially without hiccups.
[10:15:33] <ketchupicecream2> Sapphirus: sell a kidney
[10:15:44] <Sapphirus> no thanks
[10:16:16] <RetroNed> Old GPUs and Hardware can be collected by the side of the road. I was able to afford mine by getting a customized pre-built from CyberPower.
[10:17:03] <Sapphirus> Unfortunately I built my own system, so I either shell out 2 grand or keep my GTX 980 lol
[10:17:14] <RetroNed> Mine's damn near top of the line, way more powerful than what I need (1080p@120hz) but it's good to have plenty of leg room.
[10:18:09] <RetroNed> Everyone I talked to online was just "Build it yourself!" The moment I got my PC, guess who all were begging for GPUs~
[10:18:27] <Sapphirus> since GPUs are nigh impossible to find near MSRP unless you bot it, I just went overkill with every other component of my system to make up for it.
[10:19:04] <RetroNed> I totally get that there. I got to the mentality of "What's another $200?"
[10:19:21] <RetroNed> Even got my name engraved on the system itself.
[10:20:26] *** Quits: amigojapan (uid86330@id-86330.helmsley.irccloud.com) ()
[10:21:34] <RetroNed> The only thing about 120hz displays are that older games tend to freak out on it because it's not at all synced with the CPU Clock speeds.
[10:21:44] <Sapphirus> Yeah, which is how I ended up with 7 industrial noctua fans in my PC case
[10:22:16] <RetroNed> Gotta love Sonic 3 playing at 500% Speed. Glad I moved to Steam.
[10:22:44] <MootPoot> back
[10:22:51] <MootPoot> that was a long ass grocery trip
[10:23:07] <MootPoot> well, it only took an hour but I spent like 2 hours cooking and setthing things and prepping things
[10:23:29] <RetroNed> I've only got about 5 fans in my PC, and everyone was just "Your PC is going to be throttled and overheat. Get more fans."
[10:23:30] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: how goes the prices in your igloo
[10:23:46] *** Parts: Ashl3y4 (~MAIN_USER@user/ashl3y4) ()
[10:23:55] <RetroNed> This thing is cool as can be. My Switch runs hotter than this PC.
[10:24:37] <RetroNed> I'm over in South Carolina, so individual GPU prices are a no-go. At that point just buy a new PC.
[10:24:57] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, what prices, grocery prices or?
[10:25:06] <MootPoot> ye
[10:25:07] <MootPoot> grocery
[10:25:26] <MootPoot> feels to me its like 10-14% up from this time last year
[10:25:29] <MootPoot> seems like it at least
[10:25:33] <Sapphirus> Expensive compared to before the pandemic.
[10:25:51] <Sapphirus> Although the prices of some things have remained more or less static.
[10:25:53] <Sapphirus> Like junk food.
[10:25:53] <RetroNed> I'm glad groceries remain cheap over here. I've got a damn near limitless supply of Bread working at Panera Bread.
[10:26:48] <Sapphirus> I've become numb to these price increases in some sense.
[10:28:04] <RetroNed> I'm currently 19, so these prices are more or less my standard.
[10:28:31] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, what stuns me still is how expensive meat has gotten. Some packaged lunch meat and bread can set you up to C$40-C$50.
[10:28:32] <RetroNed> Still not worse than tourist grocery stores.
[10:28:56] <Sapphirus> I have no idea how very impoverished people are able to live right now.
[10:29:05] <MootPoot> same
[10:29:07] <RetroNed> $7 a gallon of chocolate milk.
[10:30:03] <MootPoot> tbh the price rise mainly seems to be with things that have a harsh time constraint
[10:30:10] <MootPoot> fresh veggies and meat and dairy
[10:30:24] <MootPoot> canned stuff seems to have just kept up with inflation or stayed same
[10:30:26] <MootPoot> ymmv
[10:30:33] <RetroNed> Working in food service, I can tell you. People will gladly pay for a homeless person they've never met.
[10:30:47] <Sapphirus> Yeah, although I've noticed that the expiry dates of dairy have climbed further into the future than the past.
[10:31:20] <Sapphirus> Whether that's because of supply chain efficiency or the fact the price is causing dairy not to sell so well.. I'm not so sure what.

[11:03:44] <Sapphirus> You're lucky to be able to find a hard drive that's still working beyond a certain age.
[11:04:10] <Sapphirus> SSDs usually fail because of bad firmware or NAND wear
[11:04:16] <jessedesu_onaph> Are new tape devices better
[11:04:18] <Cryowolf> Sapphirus, I have a harddrive from 2000 still working
[11:04:19] <MootPoot> jessedesu_onaph: if your data is constantly updating - I'd go sign up with backblaze or something. If you want to keep it local but still on hard drives - get 2 seagate EXOS drives or SSDs depending on how big your file sizes are and write a copy to one , and have that one copy to another and leave the other in a different location.  ( 3-2-1 backup strategy ).  IF you want to just leave it forever then those archival DVDs are your best option

[13:28:07] <Bco1981> Verbatim M DISC‚Ñ¢ optical media is the new standard for digital archival storage. Unlike traditional optical media, which utilize dyes that can break down over time, data stored on an M DISC is engraved on a patented inorganic write layer ‚Äì it will not fade or deteriorate. This unique engraving process renders these archival grade discs practically impervious to environmental exposure, including light, 
[13:28:13] <Bco1981> temperature and humidity.
[13:28:23] <Bco1981> ISO/IEC 16963 standard longevity tests have proven the durability of M DISC technology, and it withstood rigorous testing by the US Department of Defense. Based on ISO/IEC 16963 testing, M DISC media has a projected lifetime of several hundred years.

[14:27:23] <Bco1981> acording to this it's not really burning... data stored on an M DISC is engraved on a patented inorganic write layer ‚Äì it will not fade or deteriorate. This unique engraving process renders these archival grade discs practically impervious to environmental exposure, including light, temperature and humidity.
[14:27:50] <darkwitch> that's good then, since burning plastic smells quite bad
[14:28:04] <Bco1981> well i guess it "engraves" with the heat of the laser

[18:44:40] <DunceCotus> Sadale: you only have to prove it to yourself
[18:44:46] <Sadale> like preprogrammed. So the other people may not be conscienous
[18:44:46] <ButterNoodle> and thats some dangerous thinking..
[18:44:57] <ButterNoodle> serial killers think like that
[18:44:59] <ButterNoodle>  :)
[18:45:20] <Sadale> oh yeah like I'm a serial killer. ButterNoodle you should be worried! :P
[18:45:22] <DunceCotus> yes there are empty husks
[18:45:26] <DunceCotus> all around us
[18:45:39] <Sadale> I'm more like a cerael licker :3

[18:45:51] <Bco1981> whaaaaat slackware still has xmms
[18:46:12] <Bco1981> slackware 15*
[18:46:19] <DunceCotus> every husk can become just as 'real' as you or I however
[18:46:27] <DunceCotus> its a matter of connection
[18:46:46] <DunceCotus> if you are not connected to the other people they will be like husks, absent in some sense
[18:46:58] <ButterNoodle> fill those husks with semen
[18:47:09] <DunceCotus> I think you mean hunks
[18:47:53] <DunceCotus> Sadale: I dunno about your experience but its weird when observing other people like neighbours
[18:48:26] <DunceCotus> in this alienated non-community its not hard to get disconnected from others
[18:48:28] <Sadale> ah. I simply don't care about my neighbors :P
[18:48:37] <Sadale> I mean neightbots.
[18:48:45] <Sadale> neighbots*
[18:48:47] <DunceCotus> and that's what produces the sterile NPC effect
[18:49:02] <MootPoot> Wtf is slackware is that software that has empty elements in its arrays for no reason? 
[18:49:03] <DunceCotus> Sadale: right
[18:49:07] <Sadale> Now - what if everyone in this channel's a bot?
[18:49:15] <MootPoot> I'm a bot
[18:49:17] <Sadale> myself included :3
[18:49:17] <DunceCotus> Sadale: and its hard to do so, and potentially costly
