[19:22:56] <ska> Is there anything easier than Kubernetes to manage cluster computing? K8s is a pain.
[19:24:10] <ska> I see discussions of having an entire "Team" of peole to manage K8s, and that seems unsustainable for small groups.

[19:26:00] <rawtaz> there's k3s you can use, and also minicube and rancher for example. there's also nomad from hashicorp.
[19:26:05] <rawtaz> plenty of options, all daunting :D

[21:32:00] <uio> rawtaz, nomad is cool and I personally really like it, but it's also no free lunch
[21:32:02] *** Joins: ormaaj (~ormaaj@user/ormaaj)
[21:53:22] <rawtaz> i havent used it, only researched it a bit. would you mind elaborating on wht you said? im curious
[22:02:13] <uio> basically if you want to use nomad, it's very likely that you are going to setup consul and vault too. And something like traefik possibly
[22:02:27] <uio> And you're going to have to setup your load balancer
[22:03:21] <uio> on top of that you'll have to think of TLS too.
[22:04:18] <uio> Letsencrypt will get you half of the way, you still have to write the automation around it and provision traefik with the certs
[22:06:11] <uio> traefik supports letsencrypt someone might say, and they wouldn't be wrong. But it's going to be a fun dance if you do the http challenge and you have multiple instances running
[22:07:27] <uio> someone else might say, "just do the dns challenge then". If you have an api key sure, but even then it's still not without caveats
[22:08:34] <uio> *disclaimer* I built a proof-of-concept paas with nomad 
[22:21:07] <rawtaz> wow, i'd love to know more about your experiences with this and the PoC you created. it's really interesting. thanks for sharing this overview :)
[22:21:27] <rawtaz> do you think that the issues you mentioned are not equally present in other stacks?
[22:21:54] <rawtaz> you should have called me when you were about to to the PoC so i could sit on your shoulder and watch :3
[22:22:02] <uio> heh :)
[22:22:11] <uio> well k8s have most of these things automated away
[22:22:36] <uio> and there are a bunch of companies offering these managed services
[22:22:57] <rawtaz> you mean k8s services i take it
[22:22:58] <uio> while absolutely no-one (to my knowledge) is offering nomad :(
[22:25:47] <uio> I can tell you more about the PoC, give me a minute I need to bounce I'll
[22:25:49] <uio> be back soon
[22:26:12] <rawtaz> no worries, and i dont really want to take too much of your time
[22:34:21] <rawtaz> i have to go out a bit to grab something to eat, sorry. bbiaw!
