[19:54:13] <tzcrawford> How can I rebind mode-leave to something other than shift+escape?
[19:54:59] <tzcrawford> It says it is bound to passthrough, I don't know what that means
[19:59:50] <The-Compiler> tzcrawford: It's bound to shift+escape in passthrough mode only, which is a mode you'd typically only use when you want to pass all keys (including escape) to a website with its own keybindings
[20:00:32] <The-Compiler> tzcrawford: what's your goal? I don't quite follow. But in general, you would unbind the existing binding and bind your own instead, see https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/doc/help/configuring.asciidoc

[20:41:41] <chadkouse> The-Compiler: Hi hope you're doing good and thanks for the continued great work.  I've been using this patch https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/2471#issuecomment-670834638 for a long time now -- wondering if there's a plan to ever merge this patch into the code base?  I've been just pulling / rebasing / building manually 
[20:42:36] <The-Compiler> chadkouse: IIRC last time I tried it, it had some issues, but I don't remember what those were
[20:43:13] <The-Compiler> chadkouse: no immediate plans unless toofar plans to pick it up and turn it into a PR. I might pick up the issue myself at some point, but I have a lot on my plate, so don't hold your breath.
[20:43:45] <chadkouse> well fwiw it still applies cleanly to 2.4.0.. I'd make a PR but yeah all I have is anecdotal evidence that it works right using it myself... 
[20:45:12] <The-Compiler> chadkouse: there are also some considerations around the behaviour changes mentioned there - some people might prefer the old behaviour, maybe it should be configurable for a start, maybe it needs some adjustments, etc. etc.
[20:45:28] <chadkouse> yeah I would be very happy to make it a setting that's off by default :D
[20:46:12] <chadkouse> toofar: have you done any more with this work?

[21:47:32] <Dieterbe> i checked out the qutebrowser codebase today. wondering how accessible it is to work on. to my surprise i see 120k lines of python code? :/ this seems crazy much
[22:07:46] <The-Compiler> Dieterbe: lines of code is a rather poor measure of accessibility or even complexity, but could be, I suppose
[22:09:21] <Dieterbe> The-Compiler: am i seeing this right though? or does that include dependencies or datafiles or something? 
[22:10:00] <The-Compiler> Dieterbe: well, there are many ways to count code - how are you measuring?
[22:10:54] <Dieterbe> i use 'tokei' and also find . -name '*.py' | xargs wc -l
[22:10:56] <The-Compiler> Dieterbe: tokei (modern cloc replacement) says for Python: 90k code, 11k comments, 19k blanks (rounded to 1k though)
[22:12:08] <Dieterbe> seems like a lot to handle. i work on a code base of 30k with a team of several people :o 
[22:12:59] <The-Compiler> Dieterbe: about 5.5k lines (as per wc) is indeed a data file, qutebrowser/resources.py - also that includes tests and everything, which might as well be more data than actual code
[22:15:39] <The-Compiler> Dieterbe: then again simply adding up the lines "wc -l" is reporting for qutebrowser/**/*.py results in 56k, so dunno how you (or tokei) gets to 150k
[22:16:37] <Dieterbe> there's a bunch of .py files in the root dir of the repo
[22:17:10] <The-Compiler> well yes, but not 100k worth of lines
[22:18:43] <Dieterbe> not sure where 150k came from. i saw 120k. which matches what you said. 90+11+19
[22:18:54] <The-Compiler> err, yes, my bad
[22:19:04] <Dieterbe> anyway, doesn't seem that useful to obsess over the numbers too much
[22:19:08] <The-Compiler> right
[22:19:54] <The-Compiler> either way, yes, qutebrowser is a rather complex beast, but also something people generally seem to enjoy contributing to even as a first project sometimes
[22:20:04] <Dieterbe> i was just trying to get an idea of 1. workload on you - is it still manageable for basically a single maintainer and 2. secondarily, how hard it is for newcomers to get a good understanding of the codebase and start digging in.
[22:21:08] <The-Compiler> 1. it depends, but thankfully there are some people helping too (but yes, a lot of stuff is on my plate - as it happens with many open source projects
[22:21:50] <The-Compiler> 2. usually yes, because it's reasonably structured (with a few exceptions, which I hope to find time soon-ish to refactor) - at least that's what I hear people say
[22:22:44] <The-Compiler> the biggest issue workload-wise isn't really the complexity of qutebrowser itself, but the amount of contributions vs. the amount of people helping with code review and such
[22:23:48] <Dieterbe> FYI I started the uzbl project, a long time ago - 2009 apparently. and kindof gave up on those ideals after it turned into too much work. i thought luakit was a really cool project too. but as you pointed out, webkit is basically a no-go nowadays. so i'm excited to run into this project
[22:24:15] <The-Compiler> ah yeah, now that I think of it, your nick rings a bell
[22:24:57] <Dieterbe> hmm ok so you need more reviewers and/or getting reviewers to develop enough expertise to make decisions
[22:26:25] <The-Compiler> I guess, also see https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/discussions/6704#discussioncomment-1379213 for some musings around this (the original post is... a mess, but I think the answer to it is still a good summary)
[22:27:09] <Dieterbe> i'm gonna play with qute a bit more. i hope it can switch to it, and if/when i do, i'm looking forward to start sponsoring too
[22:27:13] <The-Compiler> but yeah, there is a reason most of those minimal browser projects died at some point, it's not exactly a simple thing to do :)
[22:27:50] <The-Compiler> I used dwb for quite some time before starting qutebrowser, when it died due to the WebKit 1 -> 2 API break
[22:31:15] <The-Compiler> My solution to this when I figured out that this is just too much to shoulder as a hobby is doing it as a part-time job. Unfortunately that job needed more mental space than I'd have liked, so now I'm basically employed between July and February or so, and can focus on qutebrowser more or less full-time for the rest of the year. Time will tell how that works out, but judging from the full-time
[22:31:17] <The-Compiler> work I did during holydays when still studying, it will work out better than what I did for the last 2 years
[22:31:37] <The-Compiler> (and given how I've been mentioning this on and off now, I should probably write a blog post about it)
[22:33:30] <Dieterbe> you mean you had a job between july 2021 til next month? and after that, plan to go fulltime on qb?
[22:33:34] <The-Compiler> I also had some long-standing plans to move some code to a Python extension API (and still plan to do so), but that job situation plus the PR backlog made it difficult to do bigger refactorings
[22:35:11] <The-Compiler> I'm teaching Python to >100 students at a university between July and February (i.e. in the spring semester, plus some time for preparation/grading), and not doing anything for university for (most of) the first half of the year
[22:36:21] <The-Compiler> so the idea is that my time I work on open source is much less fragmented than it was before, when I worked 40% but over the entire year, with weekly deadlines more or less
[22:38:43] <Dieterbe> interesting. hmmm, perhaps some of the outstanding issues or pr reviews could be good homework assingments for the students ;-)
[22:38:49] <The-Compiler> hehe
[22:39:17] <The-Compiler> you wouldn't say that if you saw the project assignments some of those students handed in :D

[23:25:20] <Dieterbe> anyone have thoughts or techniques about "grouping" tags? e.g. i may have some tabs i always want open, a set of tags corresponding to project 1, another set of tags for project 2, etc.

[23:34:06] <nytpu> and i just have one window as my "main" session that i always have open
