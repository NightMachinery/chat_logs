[21:40:55] <EvanR> Someone I know just bought a monitor that has 144Hz
[21:41:34] <EvanR> my code has the magic number 60 in it right now, and it feels babylonian AF now
[21:42:19] <EvanR> hopefully it doesn't summon Gozer
[21:43:56] <sm> morning all
[21:44:35] <sm> https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/s4m5ow/ann_spade_a_simple_programming_language_with/ looks like a fun new game platform 
[21:45:09] <sm> for small/starter games perhaps
[21:46:47] <EvanR> it looks like dark basic
[21:47:03] <EvanR> but terminal only
[21:47:05] <EvanR> cool

[22:12:25] <f-a> the idea is not bad, is it
[22:16:22] <EvanR> I find IDEs hard to use, but old basic-style environments like this are from another time where you just had your code and the run / return to code key
[22:16:41] <EvanR> definite flow
