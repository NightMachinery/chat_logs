[01:39:03] <shawwwn> once you get over how neat it is, you'll be like "...and I can write code for this thing too?" lol
[01:39:17] <shawwwn> GAN + VR is definitely unexplored territory. felt that way for years.
[01:40:02] <shawwwn> hook it up to a [whatever the kids use these days, but nvidia] GPU, and gg you can generate 20fps
[01:40:08] <shawwwn> of gan inferences
[01:40:13] <gwern> people don't investigate distilling/sparsity enough so the latency requirements make it a pain, on top of the exotic lockeddown hardware etc... GANs are a tiny niche, and as soon as you add 'and X', you've filtered down to ~0 people worldwide
[01:40:16] <shawwwn> which is more than enough to "walk around" latent space
[01:41:10] <shawwwn> that may be. but now you can sell an NFT of specific latent vectors, which happen to map into a 3D walkable space
[01:41:36] <shawwwn> so if you walk around and discover a neat looking cave full of doughnut fairies, you can go sell it for an ez $500
[01:41:47] <gwern> yeah, NFTs may help by focusing attention very intently and giving a huge incentive to finish & publish
[01:42:06] <shawwwn> all that's required is to hook up a chrome browser to view the latents, the same way you can view art right now

[01:57:12] <saturn2> oh, GW labels the OP separately, without a letter
[01:57:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> The remaining discrepancy is an off by 1 error so my first instinct is that it's "is the OP counted", but that would seem to indicate an error in the wrong direction

Cumulatively, Americans are sitting on piles of cash; they have $2.3 trillion more in savings in the last 19 months than would have been expected in the prepandemic path.
[02:32:58] <feepbot> The median household’s checking account balance was 50 percent higher in July of this year than in 2019, according to the JPMorgan Chase Institute. Yet workers’ assessment of the economy is scathing. In a Gallup poll in October, 68 percent of respondents said they thought economic conditions were getting worse. The share who thought things were getting better was lower than in
[02:32:58] <feepbot> April 2009, when the global financial crisis was still underway. And it is not merely a partisan response to the Biden presidency. In the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey, Republicans rate current economic conditions worse than Democrats do — but both groups give ratings about as low as they did in the early 2010s, when unemployment was much higher and
[02:33:03] <feepbot> Americans’ finances were a wreck. The reasons seem to be tied to the psychology of inflation and the ways people assess their economic well-being — as well as the uneven effects that rising prices and shortages have on different families.

[02:58:41] <kuudes> "The median household’s checking account balance was 50 percent higher in July of this year than in 2019" surely inflation can't have been more than +50% since 2019 even in usa
[02:59:07] <gwern> kuudes: checking account balances are typically pretty small, so fiscal etc can produce a large checking account change
[03:02:05] <kuudes> how has median income behaved? has it risen more or less than inflation in usa?
[03:05:45] <ggreer> one of my coworkers got his booster. he was out for 2 days. his fever was over 101F
[03:06:04] <shawwwn> linear: the only person I know of who’s taking the metaverse seriously is avaer. In hindsight, I probably took it less seriously than him, and he was probably right at the time. That doesn’t necessarily make him a good bet, but it might be directionally correct.
[03:06:11] <ggreer> I'll get a few more anecdotes on monday
[03:06:30] <ggreer> so far it looks like 3rd doses are about as "fun" as 2nd doses, which means... eh I'm not a fan
[03:06:38] <kuudes> pfizer or moderna?
[03:06:39] *** Quits: src (~src@user/src) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:06:42] <ggreer> moderna
[03:06:50] <kuudes> moderna boosters have got halved over here
[03:06:53] <kuudes> 100 -> 50
[03:07:07] <kuudes> pfizer has 30 units
[03:07:10] <ggreer> I assume the FDA sucks at approving anything so my guess is the doses are the same
[03:07:32] <shawwwn> He was walking around with a backpack battery powering a magic leap, back in 2019. Magic leap may not be good, but avaer is one of the few hackers with real AR experience
[03:07:35] <ggreer> if I get a booster it'll be pfizer
[03:07:35] <kuudes> I guess you might aim for pfizer, as it has less of the stuff
[03:07:40] <kuudes> yeah
[03:07:57] <kuudes> personally, I am quite willing to pay the couple of days per quarter until this ends
[03:07:57] <ggreer> I got pfizer for my first two doses. first dose was fine. just some numbness and pain. second dose was brutal
[03:08:29] <kuudes> oh, btw, rs virus vaccine trial is ongoing
[03:08:40] <kuudes> I don't know how it is in usa, but it seemed like a good deal
[03:09:06] <kuudes> though so far only people 60+ years or under 9 mo or females of reproductive age, pregnant, and same but nonpregnant
[03:09:17] <kuudes> so I can't get one in any case
[03:09:23] <kuudes> but I presume some other people could

[03:09:55] <kuudes> for covid and influenza we have vaccines
[03:11:27] <ggreer> I'm a dumbbell centrist when it comes to a lot of disease stuff. eg: I was willing to pay thousands of dollars for the vaccine back in january/february. (hell if the vaccine just came out now and paying $$$ was the only option, I'd totally do that). back when masks were declared ineffective, I was wearing a P100 respirator in public and avoiding everyone
[03:11:51] <ggreer> but now that I'm vaccinated and it looks like the vaccine drastically reduces the chances of moderate/severe covid, I'm just living my life
[03:12:20] <ggreer> and I tend to frequent places that don't give a shit about masks (mostly on the washington side. portland is ridiculous)
[03:14:02] <ggreer> I think it's probably worthwhile for my parents to get boosters (they already did, btw) but me? eh I'm on the fence. I don't want another couple days of bone-aching fever followed by diminished physical and mental capacity
[03:14:52] <ggreer> but if a winter wave starts looking more likely, I'll probably do it

[03:19:55] <kuudes> it seems to me (I don't really know) that a jab per 6 months keeps the immunity about stable, and faster than that gets it better
[03:20:32] <kuudes> I guess I should check back how sweden or india is doing now
[03:23:48] <adiabatic> I'm weird and inconsistent about masks and it's kind of meta-bugging me. I wear a well-fitting N95 at the grocery store, but I do the chin-diaper thing in the (depopulated) cardio room at the gym and spend just as much time in the sauna as I ever did, totally unmasked. Oh, and I don't really worry about going out to eat with friends, if only because I barely do that ever.
[03:26:54] <kuudes> there was some doctor who said that covid might not survive in sauna temps (>70 C) and sauna moisture levels (~100%) but I don't know if it is true or not
[03:27:11] <ggreer> the proteins would probably denature at such high temps
[03:27:32] <ggreer> though if people did that long enough, it could be selected to survive in high temps
[03:27:41] <kuudes> it might take time if they are inside a droplet or something
[03:27:55] <kuudes> I don't know, and my prior is heavy on "I should not be sure"
[03:28:18] <adiabatic> I think the longest anyone there lasts is 15 minutes at a stretch at around 190° (87°C)
[03:28:28] <adiabatic> and I'm one of them
[03:28:31] <kuudes> :)
[03:28:39] <ggreer> the droplet gets to ambient temperature almost instantly
[03:28:48] <adiabatic> kuudes: what's "rookie numbers" in Finnish? ;)
[03:29:21] <kuudes> people vary in their preferences, 70 - 100 C is usually normal I think
[03:29:37] <kuudes> over 120 C is a bit heavy
[03:29:57] <kuudes> under 60 is meh
[03:30:14] <adiabatic> all the hypothermic-conditioning science I've seen tests at 80°C and 100°C. what takes, like, an hour at 80°C will only take 15 minutes at 100°C
[03:30:38] <kuudes> I got my new house's sauna corked today, it was nice :)
[03:30:53] <adiabatic> 60°C is a waste of time IMO. I tend to get cranky when it drops below 80°C
[03:31:01] <adiabatic> so, like, cork all along the walls?
[03:31:23] <kuudes> I have a wooden kiuas stove which has the nice construct that it is the fireplace of the fireplace room as well, so I don't have to insert the wood in the sauna side, and it stays clean
[03:31:36] <ggreer> I'd need a lot of square footage before I made one room a sauna
[03:31:42] <kuudes> eh, a finnish idiom, "opened" "taken into use" etc
[03:32:06] <adiabatic> Oh, like "cracked opened" or "christened"
[03:32:09] <kuudes> yes
[03:33:22] <kuudes> this house also has an option to later install a hot tub in the porch
[03:33:29] <ggreer> neat
[03:33:51] <kuudes> a positive surprise was that the air conditioning keeps co2 level at 450 indoors at half power
[03:34:13] <adiabatic> even better
[03:34:34] <kuudes> and it has comfort conditioning from geoheat under the house, basic heat comes from district heating
[03:34:35] <adiabatic> in the wintertime here it's a struggle to keep fresh air coming in when we've got almost all of the windows closed
[03:34:41] <kuudes> indeed
[03:35:00] <kuudes> here it will preheat it from ground heat at winters and precool at summers
[03:35:08] <kuudes> with 7 W
[03:35:23] <adiabatic> is this one of those newfangled heat pump things?
[03:35:26] <kuudes> yeah
[03:35:54] <kuudes> it circulates ethanol or methanol under the house and uses that to pump heat to or from there to the intake air
[03:36:18] <kuudes> I was not specifically optimizing for that but it is quite nice! :D
[03:36:45] <kuudes> each room has its finetuning for temperature through the floor heating
[03:36:50] <adiabatic> so, like, instead of water in a water-cooled CPU system, it uses ethanol or methanol?
[03:36:54] <kuudes> yeah
[03:37:09] <kuudes> I don't know which. I hope it is ethanol but it could be methanol
[03:37:23] <kuudes> in normal conditions it does not matter, but in case of leakage methanol would be problematic
[03:38:21] <kuudes> indoor carage as well, so if I want I could just keep to t-shirt during winter if I drive to downtown parking cave etc
[03:38:40] <kuudes> though with covid I suppose not much of that :-p
[03:38:54] <kuudes> also fiber internet
[03:39:55] <kuudes> best of all, this passed the inspection! which is rare, as my friend who is certified inspector, is... eh, strict, pedant, and remembers all the building code by heart

[04:29:10] <gwern> hm. they didn't train on russian images of their own. they used the obvious datasets, and just translated from english to russian -_- and now everyone is translating english to russian just to use it
[04:29:16] <gwern> which is... pointless?
[04:29:24] <gwern> or at least jointly train it!
[04:29:44] <catern> I just started reading it because it was done, and the author's conception of politics and economics is terrible
[04:30:03] <catern> i was tricked at first by the grimdark setting, but it seems that the author just made the setting dark without any analysis of why
[04:30:14] <gwern> catern: that's too bad. 'an original world high fantasy with a touch of the ancient Near East (think Sumer and Babylon) to it. The world is cursed with a recurring cycle of disasters, and nobody agrees on who should pay the price so humanity can survive.' sounds kinda neat

[04:32:21] <Robomot> Ben Savage - Wikipedia (Bennett Joseph Savage (born September 13, 1980[citation needed]) is an American actor. He played the lead role of Cory Matthews on the ABC sitcom Boy Meets World (1993–2000) and its Disney Channel sequel Girl Meets World (2014–2017). …)

[04:32:38] <catern> but, to spoil it, I gave up in frustration when it turned out that the protagonist's big quest to right wrongs, in this society where 80% of people are literal slaves, is to... make the people who are raised from birth to be human sacrifices, actual rulers rather than religious figureheads
[04:33:11] <catern> apparently it's... immoral for... the people who are human sacrifices and religious figureheads, to be distinct from the actual kings?

[04:33:32] <catern> i skipped to the end and that appears to be all he did in the entire story, so
[04:34:05] <gwern> sounds dubious. what if they get angry about the sacrifice part and make bad decisions? seems like the protagonist should be investing in opiate research, I think the ancient middle east had access to poppy
[04:34:16] <catern> gwern: that's literally what the evil antagonists say
[04:34:28] <catern> well not the opiates part, that would be a good idea
[04:37:29] <catern> instead they just raise the human sacrifices in pampered seclusion, educating/brainwashing them to be willing to sacrifice themselves, which is... apparently child abuse? this isn't an omelas situation because their life, even with the human sacrifice at 25 or so, is still better than 99% of the population (which also is embroiled in a forever war that kills 50% of the enlisted mostly-poor-people militia every year)
[04:39:33] <catern> (well one key part here is that the religious figureheads also have substantial magic powers - they can control everyone else's magic powers. but that's all the more reason to keep them as figureheads or better yet, drugged up all the time)

[04:40:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> He was a popular child actor, apparently transitioning successfully into adult roles, but then he decided to take a break from acting to go race cars
[04:41:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> And after years of doing this, and multiple concussions received as a result, he's so fucked up that he can't even remember most of his acting career due to the memory loss
[04:41:23] <catern> also, the god that gives them all magic powers is... misogynistic and aggressive? or at least, the magic powers make you not want to hit women and make you excessively violent. and yet there has been no reflection on how *maybe* this god doesn't really correlate with the best admistrator or indeed morality at all?
[04:42:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Needless to say his acting career is over, his racing career (such as it was) is also over, and now... he's just gonna live out the rest of what remains of his life with significant brain damage and no meaningful career prospects
[04:42:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> For... pretty much no good reason
[04:43:22] <catern> also I haven't even mentioned some of the ridiculous economics aspects. like how in this grindingly poor civilization in a forever war against daemons, there's a city with free public transit.
[04:43:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: I mean, isn't that also true in reality (except the magic powers)? Isn't that a common complaint about Christians, Muslims, etc.? SO that part seems realistic
[04:44:43] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: true, but I'm beginning to doubt whether the writer is at all self-aware about it
[04:45:50] <catern> oh also how in this bronze age society, there are banks where you can deposit your money and earn interest
[04:46:08] <gwern> that's not really odd
[04:46:24] <gwern> ancient mesopotamia had pretty sophisticated trade and commerce
[04:46:45] <gwern> temples and smiths in many areas would do lending
[04:47:14] <catern> did those temples and smiths accept deposits?
[04:47:40] <gwern> I'm not sure about ancient mesopotamia specifically, but plenty did. look at goldsmiths in england
[04:48:38] <catern> there's a lot of difference between goldsmiths in 17th century england and ancient mesopotamia
[04:48:40] <gwern> it's a very natural thing. they already possess lots of valuables on hand, know to assay, will be in possesion of yours to recoin or repair...
[04:48:51] <catern> if there were banks accepting deposits in Rome I would be persuaded

[04:51:05] <catern> to be clear I'm definitely not saying there weren't people loaning out capital and earning interest
[04:51:43] <gwern> and as far as rome goes: 'The Roman empire at some time formalized the administrative aspect of banking and instituted greater regulation of financial institutions and financial practices. Charging interest on loans and paying interest on deposits became more highly developed and competitive.'
[04:51:43] <catern> I'm purely skeptical of the "I deposit money and earn interest on it" part - not sure what to call that, "public deposit banking"
[04:52:01] <catern> interesting, okay fair enough then
[04:56:57] <catern> given the specific economy outlined in this story (which is a classic palace economy with most economic activity being agricultural and carried out by slaves) it still seems highly dubious that you'd have banks paying interest (who are they even loaning to?) but I grant that maybe it's possible
[04:57:14] <catern> or at least, it's not totally absurd
[04:57:37] <gwern> hm, encoclopedia brittanica apparently claims they paid interest on deposits, but the WP article on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Egibi seems to specifically deny that

[05:07:30] <gwern> arguably cogview and wudao etc beat rudall-e to it

[05:08:47] <gwern> cogview2 seems like it might've fixed the blurring
[05:08:54] <shawwwn> I assume if cogview and wudao were like that, then someone would have noticed

[07:19:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> AGH! And this thread is just like ... "We pushed a change on the servers that should resolve this." and the issue opener is just like "thx, fixed"
[07:19:46] <PapuaHardyNet> catern: you should have an RSS feed
[07:19:56] <PapuaHardyNet> for your website that is
[07:19:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> But how does that help??? Surely the solution to this bug isn't "get everyone in the world whose website causes this to fix their shit (in an unspecified way)"
[07:20:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> It makes no sense for this to be fixed server-side in the first place!

[07:23:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Detect HTTP/2 headers and refuse to load the request??
[07:23:47] <saturn2> turn off trailers i assume?
[07:23:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't even ... know what that is :(
[07:24:18] <saturn2> like headers but they come after the body
[07:24:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Isn't that something that would be done server-side?
[07:24:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Turning them off?
[07:25:23] <saturn2> oh sorry i misread
[07:26:26] <saturn2> but yeah fixing it server side does seem like a valid resolution for dropbox

[07:33:56] <CoJaBo> Obormot\Arcturus: For things that aren't browsers, nobody supports HTTP/2
[07:34:00] <saturn2> no, a lot of sites use it
[07:34:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> CoJaBo: What does that mean exactly
[07:34:24] <CoJaBo> Bots, API clients, etc
[07:34:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Hm yeah I see. Wikipedia, even...
[07:34:51] <CoJaBo> Nearly all browsers and most major websites support it
[07:35:22] <CoJaBo> So most human traffic is going to be HTTP/2. But support for other web tools appears to be nonexistent
[07:36:08] <saturn2> curl supports it
[07:36:21] <CoJaBo> A reason we haven't tried to move our stuff to HTTP/2, is because HTTP/3 is nigh, and we can never support HTTP/3
[07:36:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm
[07:36:44] <quanticle> In which version of HTTP are they going to fix the spelling of "referer"?
[07:36:48] <quanticle> That's the version I'm interested in.
[07:36:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guess Apple fixed this bug in later OS versions
[07:37:00] <CoJaBo> lol
[07:37:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh well
[07:37:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Never
[07:37:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Personally I support changing the dictionary instead
[07:37:37] <quanticle> I mean, at this point, changing the dictionary is probably more realistic
[07:37:49] <quanticle> We need to get a critical mass of people spelling it as "referer"
[07:37:49] <CoJaBo> quanticle: I think HTTP/3 compresses them to tokens, so arguably there, but not quite because that remains the human-readable name

[07:52:21] <PapuaHardyNet> with Named Entity Recognition you can rule out sentences with too many named entities that may be confusing the language model

[07:57:57] <CoJaBo> quanticle: They make industrial ones for scanning electronics/parts, apparently. I didn't know that was a thing either lol 
[07:58:33] <CoJaBo> They're a LOT smaller, since they can spin the sample instead of the machine. However, I was given an inaccurate impression of "LOT" when I googled this
[07:59:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... can I specify HTTP/1.1 in request headers? Is that possible?
[07:59:22] <CoJaBo> The scale of it looked like this would be just a heavy microwave. Thing's about the size of a mid-size freezer, and weight of an adult Elephant (probably)
[07:59:47] <CoJaBo> Obormot\Arcturus: If your request lib supports selecting the HTTP version, but most don't seem to
[08:00:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> CoJaBo: Eh? I'm asking about http headers specifically
[08:00:31] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: http/2 won't be enabled unless an upgrade header is included in the request
[08:00:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> I can set arbitrary headers. It's just a dictionary
[08:00:33] <CoJaBo> The version isn't a header, it's a whole different protocol
[08:00:41] <quanticle> CoJaBo: If you can read the Model/Serial number off it, maybe you can look up how much it weighs and decide whether you need a furniture dolly and a few friends or a crane and professional movers.

[08:01:22] <CoJaBo> I assume half of it is lead or something >_>

For example, it can be used by a client to upgrade a connection from HTTP 1.1 to HTTP 2.0, or an HTTP or HTTPS connection into a WebSocket.)
[08:01:39] <CoJaBo> It's in a really fricking stupid spot too
[08:01:51] <CoJaBo> Can't get a forklift into that room to move it
[08:01:52] <quanticle> spxtr: And two very coordinated forklift drivers?
[08:02:09] <quanticle> Well, how did they get it into the room then?
[08:02:12] <CoJaBo> Can't get to the sides of it either, it's sitting on a countertop
[08:02:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: errr, what is the meaning of that warning? HTTP/2 disallows this headers...?
[08:02:38] <CoJaBo> quanticle: Honestly, my only assumption is they must've built the lab around it
[08:02:50] <PapuaHardyNet> hahahah
[08:02:58] <CoJaBo> As I really don't know how one would move such a thing
[08:03:18] <CoJaBo> Our one office building's generator, they literally actually did do that
[08:04:09] <quanticle> I mean, it's not entirely implausible. If CT scanner was around when the lab was constructed, it's very possible that the they moved it in before they added things like door or walls.
[08:04:15] <CoJaBo> We've been trying to sell it on craigslist, and I'm not even exaggerating
[08:04:22] <quanticle> i.e. when they put it it, they very well might have been able to get a forklift in there
[08:04:26] <quanticle> *put it in
[08:04:44] <CoJaBo> Yeh, I cannot see this in any way fitting thru the door and down the hallway
[08:04:47] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: http/2 has a separate protocol negotiation thing
[08:05:17] <CoJaBo> The only even theoretical way would be to flip it on its side, and I don't know if you can do that xD
[08:05:38] <quanticle> Do you know what specific brand/model it is?
[08:06:11] <CoJaBo> There's a company name on the front that doesn't exist, but it's not clear if that was manufacturer or the name of the lab or whoever installed/maintained it
[08:06:56] <quanticle> And of course you can't get around to the back where the little metal plate is that would tell you the actual manufacturer name and serial number because you can't move it.
[08:07:23] <CoJaBo> I just assumed it was the manufactutrer, so I didn't dig deeper until someone pointed out that it might just have been slapped on by someone else lol
[08:07:40] <quanticle> Well, what is the name on the front, anyway?
[08:07:44] <CoJaBo> And yeh; the back is basically unreachable, and I didn't think to look inside it for any markings

[08:14:17] <CoJaBo> Whys that?
[08:14:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> To fix this HTTP/2 thing
[08:14:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'll just have to not load HTTP/2-supporting websites
[08:14:44] <CoJaBo> wat‘n’ternation
[08:15:03] <CoJaBo> What is it using to request pages?
[08:15:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> NSURLSession
[08:16:59] <CoJaBo> Can't just use a different lib or something?
[08:18:04] <CoJaBo> Also.. why aren't they just able to fix that bug? or at least, doesn't it allow you to catch the exception, or is it like PHP where an error terminates the whole app rofl
[08:18:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Using a different lib would be like multiple orders of magnitude more work and would be worse in many ways
[08:18:46] <quanticle> And, from what I understand, fixing the lib would require an OS upgrade?
[08:18:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right.

[18:06:33] <PapuaHardyNet> CSV exports from sources like activecampaign always give me problems because they don't properly quote entries that contain commas inside them

[18:08:35] <Robomot> Anti-vaxxers bribe doctors for "vaccination" with water, end up with the real vaccine (Mass fake vaccinations have been taking place in dozens of vaccination centers throughout Greece, me)

[18:08:59] <kuudes> "Mass fake vaccinations have been taking place in dozens of vaccination centers throughout Greece, media reported on Sunday. The bribe fee for doctors and nurses is apparently 400 euros. the fee is paid is by those who do not want to receive the vaccines against Covid-19 but want to gain access to several activities or simply avoid the twice per week Rapid tests for professional and other reasons.
[18:08:59] <kuudes> But then a hilarious thing happened: Doctors pocketed the bribe but administered real vaccine and not “water” in order to avoid getting into trouble should the fake vaccination come out, according to a report by Mega TV."
[18:09:28] <PapuaHardyNet> good one
[18:09:45] <gwern> the rarely seen 'conman with a heart of gold'
[18:09:57] <feep> while that is funny, can we nonetheless agree that giving people medicine without their consent or even knowledge is morally wrong
[18:10:13] <PapuaHardyNet> hah, you just see the bright side. The antivaxxers see proof that they are being non-consensually vaxxed no matter what
[18:10:23] <gwern> they did consent, wink wink nudge nudge. it's right there on the paperwork they signed
[18:10:23] <feep> I mean, they're right.
[18:10:40] <gwern>  antivaxxer: "please inject me with *vaccines*" doctor: "ok"
[18:10:46] <PapuaHardyNet> imagine how violated they feel though
[18:10:47] <two2thehead> PapuaHardyNet, hm. interesting
[18:11:08] <PapuaHardyNet> forced vaccination is rape. You heard it from me first!
[18:11:23] <catern> they're literally having fluids injected inside of them
[18:11:30] <catern> without their consent
[18:11:47] <gwern> I mean, they've consented to getting fluids injected inside them either way
[18:11:53] <PapuaHardyNet> inject me with your fluids doctor uwu
[18:11:54] <catern> hmm
[18:12:25] <catern> gwern: they consented to have *water* injected inside them
[18:12:33] <catern> not these other kinds of fluid!
[18:12:33] <gwern> and there's plenty of water inside a vaccine
[18:12:45] <feep> I'm with catern on this
[18:12:51] <feep> this is funny, but also wrong.
[18:12:59] <PapuaHardyNet> but seriously, it's quite traumatic to realize you've been nonconsensually vaccinated
[18:13:16] <feep> yes.
[18:13:31] <catern> imagine if I promised to only ejaculate water but then I ejaculated semen instead
[18:13:33] <kuudes> personally I am just for mandatory vaccinations these days
[18:13:33] <catern> that would be rape.
[18:13:51] <gwern> it also raises some amusing legal questions. like, can they sue the doctors? probably not, it's standard that you can't enforce contracts or crimes for doing crimes, and that's what you were trying to do by getting fraudulent vaccinations
[18:13:54] <kuudes> depends on the jurisdiction, catern
[18:14:16] <gwern> 'you didn't deliver the fake vaccination & fraudulent papers I paid you for' would not be an allowable action
[18:14:24] <feep> morally it would be rape.
[18:15:21] <catern> ugggh okay feep yes it's wrong and we shouldn't joke about things that are morally wrong
[18:15:51] <catern> because of the well known phenomenon of "moral hazard" where if doing immoral things is funny, you'll do more of them
[18:15:51] <feep> no I don't mind the joking
[18:16:05] <PapuaHardyNet> solution: the antivaxx should take revenge on the doctor personally
[18:16:08] <feep> I just want the moral wrongness to not be forgotten
[18:16:26] <PapuaHardyNet> "are you advocating violence against doctors, papua?" yes
[18:16:43] <catern> the antivaxx should be allowed to inject the doctor with whatever they like
[18:16:51] <catern> it's only fair
[18:16:55] <kuudes> what
[18:17:34] <gwern> no, they should be allowed to inject the doctor with a booster shot. that's truly just, in both senses
[18:17:48] <feep> they should be allowed to inject the doctor with a booster shot
[18:17:54] <feep> only instead of a booster shot it's whatever they feel like
[18:17:56] <PapuaHardyNet> that... that actually is a more ethical solution than violence
[18:17:59] <gwern> by 'an eye for an eye'/a vax for a vax, and it appropriately punishes or rewards the doctor
[18:18:23] <gwern> is it a punishment, or a reward? we don't know, but the beauty is that it is self-calibrating
[18:18:34] <gwern> sorta like romans marching over the bridge
[18:20:08] <kuudes> I don't see bodily autonomy that holy. we allow use of mace etc per law
[18:20:41] <kuudes> and mandatory vaccinations are acceptable in some situations
[18:22:10] <feep> but this isn't about mandatory vaccinations
[18:22:33] <feep> it's about nonconsensual vaccination without any legal support
[18:22:37] <kuudes> yes it is because there is the requirement to get vaccinated to enjoy some benefits
[18:22:54] <feep> that's 100% unrelated to the moral problem
[18:23:04] <kuudes> how so?
[18:23:41] <feep> the state has a monopoly on force
[18:23:49] <feep> in this case, the doctors were not acting as agents of the state
[18:24:01] <PapuaHardyNet> kuudes was louis 16 in his past life
[18:24:14] <feep> they just injected their patients with chemicals that they did not consent to, or know of, with no legal justification
[18:24:27] <feep> this is wrong.
[18:24:38] <feep> it's really wrong. it's a fundamental failure at being a doctor.

[18:33:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: Maybe that Onion writer read Unsong and plagiarized
[18:33:46] <PapuaHardyNet> the title is hilarious
[18:34:34] <kuudes> I am not against forceful uploading of myself in all circumstances
[18:34:59] <kuudes> if I would be against all unconsensual actions, I should be against prisons and police as well
[18:35:17] <kuudes> clearly there are situations where it is justified to cause unconsentual things to happen
[18:35:53] <kuudes> we should aim to minimize them of course, but we can't just throw the organized society under bus of anarchy
[18:36:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Personally I am against that AI thing and also against those nonconsensual vaccinations, but for different reasons
[18:36:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't think it's analogous
[18:36:41] <feep> well, I think it's analogous from the perspective of the antivaxxer
[18:36:53] <feep> why do you think it's not?
[18:37:36] <gwern> catern: unsong stole it from jesus in the first place
[18:37:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, the harrowing of hell or w/e
[18:38:02] <feep> is that ... is that canon
[18:38:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrowing_of_Hell
[18:38:15] <Robomot> Harrowing of Hell - Wikipedia (In Christian theology, the Harrowing of Hell (Latin: Descensus Christi ad Inferos, "the descent of Christ into Hell") is the descent of Jesus into Hell (or Hades), a period of time between the Crucifixion of Jesus and his resurrection. During this period, Jesus granted salvation to the righteous who had previously died.[1] …)
[18:38:24] <kuudes> feep, are you against all killing of people, including active perpetrators who are clearly about to take lives of others?
[18:38:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Jesus was a badass
[18:38:27] <feep> I mean, that this was the point of the crucifixion
[18:38:33] <feep> kuudes: no.
[18:38:50] <kuudes> but killing people is nonconsentual affection of body
[18:38:55] <feep> cause I always thought, like, it was about jesus being a sacrifice to atone for humanity's sins
[18:39:00] <catern> gwern: hm true
[18:39:09] <feep> kuudes: I'm against almost all killing, sure
[18:39:16] <kuudes> indeed, so am I
[18:39:45] <feep> note how in my comparison above I repeatedly set out that this was a violation of the state's monopoly on force
[18:39:51] <feep> as, uh, self-defense killings are not.
[18:40:42] <kuudes> not self defence, police killings
[18:40:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Ok, so the problem with the vax situation is that it's without consent *because* it's without *knowledge*, and also against (or, at least, outside) the law (which two things are directly related, of course)
[18:40:49] <kuudes> police shoots a per about to murder a person
[18:40:51] <feep> those even less!
[18:40:56] <feep> also that's self-defense
[18:41:12] <kuudes> what
[18:41:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: This circumvents the normal methods by which people can circumscribe the things that may be done to them without their consent (by force, or threat of force, i.e. by the state)
[18:41:27] <kuudes> the police is not at threat themselves, the perp is aiming to kill someone else
[18:41:50] <feep> kuudes: self-defense of others, or self-defense by proxy, is usually classed in with self-defense.
[18:42:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: The AI case is not analogous at all, because there it's essentially just an enemy aggressor doing harm to you... am I against that? Yes... am I against a foreign army invading my home and killing me? Also yes, for the same reason, which really has no relation to the "someone does nonconsensual stuff to me secretly in the course of my interactions with other members of my society"
[18:43:42] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: okay, so your argument is that the difference is that the AI is not a citizen performing a lawful interaction?
[18:43:58] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: my argument against this would be that in this situation, the AI is de facto the state that you live in.
[18:44:06] <pompolic> hmm
[18:44:06] *** Joins: gproto23 (~gproto23@user/gproto23)
[18:46:04] <feep> hm
[18:46:05] <pompolic> i'm thinking the notion of informed consent is relevant to the vax situation
[18:46:17] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: would you say your argument is that the doctors abused the temporary trust of a doctor-patient interaction?
[18:46:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: I mean, yes, they did that too!
[18:46:36] <feep> and the AI neither has nor requires your trust, so it's a separate kind of force relation?
[18:46:42] <pompolic> what the people consented to *wasn't* what was done to them
[18:47:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: As for your counterargument, it misses the point ... yes, you *could* think of the AI as "de facto the state", but why would you? Structurally and substantively the situation just doesn't map onto that
[18:47:16] * pompolic reads back
[18:47:25] <pompolic> i see Obormot beat me to it
[18:48:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: The fact is that interactions with other individuals within the context of a lawful society, and interactions with enemies who aren't bound to you by such a society, are fundamentally very different things, and the AI thing is squarely in the latter camp, no question whatsoever
[18:48:49] <feep> right, that makes sense.
[18:49:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Consider that "being against" something is an attitude / cognitive motion that only makes sense at all in the former kind of scenario!
[18:49:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's absolutely no point in "being against" an enemy stabbing you with a sword
[18:49:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's meaningless and irrelevant
[18:49:39] <feep> I mean
[18:49:51] <feep> being an enemy attacking you already encapsulates all meanings of against.
[18:49:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol
[18:49:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok sure
[18:50:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> But you see what I mean, yes?
[18:50:14] <feep> I think so.
[18:50:19] <feep> the negotiative frame has already broken down.
[18:51:38] <feep> well but that's also why I think the AI is a good example
[18:51:43] <kuudes> feep, police is not limited to self defence. police is allowed to escalate use of force
[18:51:57] <kuudes> self defence is limited to the level of force threatened with
[18:51:59] <feep> irrelevant to the fact that in this case, that privilege is not required.
[18:52:08] <kuudes> so police indeed can shoot people who are not about to shoot other people
[18:52:19] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: the presumption here is that we get to define like, the moral laws of the AI
[18:52:19] <kuudes> or mace people who are not about to mace other people
[18:52:46] <feep> so in a sense it's in an ultimate -- self-defense has no limitation of proportionality -- social interaction with us
[18:53:03] <kuudes> no, self defence is limited to proportional
[18:53:07] <feep> not in germany
[18:53:32] <kuudes> over here a civilian is not allowed to kill to protect property etc
[18:54:02] <kuudes> a civilian is allowed to kill to protect someone to be immediately killed
[18:54:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Thankfully that's not true here
[18:54:08] <feep> same
[18:54:27] <feep> there is a limit of proportionality, but it's not based on class but rather, like, gross disproportion
[18:54:33] <feep> you can't shoot kids that steal your apples etc
[18:54:43] <kuudes> you are required to try to flee here.
[18:54:46] <feep> not here.
[18:55:07] <feep> in fact, you can in concept kill to protect property. there's no greater or lesser class of self-defense per se.
[18:55:22] <feep> you can do whatever you need to conclusively end the threat.
[18:55:28] <pompolic> legally quokka
[18:55:32] <kuudes> thats scary
[18:55:33] <PapuaHardyNet> wow, that's quite a privilege. You can kill to protect property in germany?
[18:55:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> You're actually required to try to flee in Finland? Wow, that's a really evil law
[18:55:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: The U.S. too, at least some parts
[18:55:50] <PapuaHardyNet> and you don't need to even try to flee? that's pretty good
[18:56:01] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: yeah, there's no duty to flee. that's a core law principle. "Right must not make way to violation."
[18:56:09] <feep> need not*
[18:56:19] <PapuaHardyNet> obormot: US is pretty good in terms of self-defence, they at least allow guns. unfortunately that proportionality thing is not very fun
[18:56:24] <kuudes> well sure, you are not required to flee, but not fleeing does not justify you projecting force on the assailant
[18:56:29] <kuudes> ie you are just stupid
[18:56:37] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[18:56:40] <kuudes> they do a crime, sure
[18:56:42] <feep> it does if the assailant poses an imminent threat to a protected good.
[18:56:49] <feep> that only force may avert.
[18:57:08] <PapuaHardyNet> (inb4 feep shoots someone who tries to steal his GPU)
[18:57:20] <feep> in fact, in one famous case a biker was declared not guilty for shooting and killing a police officer
[18:57:30] <feep> because the police team had failed to properly announce themselves
[18:57:43] <feep> leading to a reasonable presumption of self-defense
[18:57:46] <PapuaHardyNet> man I'm liking germany more and more 
[18:57:48] <catern> germany... is based???
[18:57:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now that's even better than American law
[18:57:55] <feep> tbf it only happened that one time
[18:57:59] <feep> nine times out of ten the police win that one
[18:58:14] <PapuaHardyNet> 10% winning chance is still huge
[18:58:24] <kuudes> sure, but protected good does not include property here
[18:58:56] <catern> what's next? not allowed to protect your body because you can always get your soul chip resleeved?
[18:59:00] <feep> it does here.
[18:59:03] <kuudes> this is why there is a specific law that nuclear plant guards are allowed to kill. they are the third class of people who have power to kill, the military, the police, and nuclear plant guards (because of international treaties require killing for nuclear plants)
[18:59:14] <feep> catern: is this the path to 3wc rapeworld
[18:59:52] <catern> "if they didn't want to be assaulted and raped they should have just discorporated"
[19:00:24] <pompolic> legally mandated quokkaism
[19:00:39] <catern> on the other hand this can go the other way
[19:00:50] <catern> if someone shoves you on the sidewalk you can legally destroy them
[19:01:00] <catern> they can just get a new body
[19:01:06] <kuudes> thats not destruction
[19:01:22] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[19:01:35] <feep> wiki says the protected goods relevant to self-defense are (mostly) life, health, freedom and property.
[19:01:49] <catern> much less if someone is invading your home - unleash all the guns, black ice, nukes, etc you want
[19:01:55] <kuudes> so if a shop guard detains you, you are allowed to punch them?
[19:02:06] <feep> yes iff they have a legal right to do so
[19:02:09] <feep> don't*
[19:02:27] <PapuaHardyNet> interesting
[19:02:29] <kuudes> over here everyone guilty gets punished
[19:02:30] <PapuaHardyNet> I really like germany now
[19:02:33] <feep> in that case however the shop guard will presumably be handling from self defense of others' property first
[19:02:39] <feep> acting*
[19:02:41] <kuudes> usually in traffic crimes, everyone is at fault and gets fined.
[19:03:14] <PapuaHardyNet> I wonder what the population adjusted crime rate is in germany and finland
[19:03:17] <kuudes> self defence for others sounds really odd concept
[19:03:28] <PapuaHardyNet> I assume it would be lesser in finland in comparison to germany
[19:04:11] <kuudes> over here specifically you can't get a licence for weapon to use it against humans unless you are in one of the mentioned three classes and in there it is limited to your official capacity
[19:04:41] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: surely germany doesn't allow citizens to own and use firearms
[19:04:45] <feep> kuudes: the idea is that there is no class of self-defense per se, there's only protecting a protected good from an imminent threat
[19:04:49] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: yesno.
[19:04:54] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: it's definitely harder than in the us.
[19:05:01] <kuudes> also the licence requires you to know how to use it, ie police has a requirement for certain yearly test scores on shooting marks etc
[19:05:10] <feep> kuudes: so whether the good is yours or another person is almost irrelevant.
[19:05:12] <PapuaHardyNet> oh, that's good, I was worried that germany is better than US in every way
[19:05:18] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: hahaha no.
[19:05:49] <pompolic> europe is suffering
[19:06:01] <pompolic> {living in, being} europe*
[19:06:22] <PapuaHardyNet> finland crime rate per 100k pop: 1.63, germany crime rate: 0.95
[19:06:27] <PapuaHardyNet> according to https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/FIN/finland/crime-rate-statistics

[19:06:31] <PapuaHardyNet> well that's surprising
[19:07:38] <PapuaHardyNet> pompolic: how is {living in | being in} europe is suffering?
[19:09:26] <feep> kuudes: amusing note
[19:09:36] <feep> if you have a gun you do have to be like "fuck off, I have a gun!"
[19:10:10] <feep> then you can like, drop a warning shot, then shoot to disable, then shoot to kill. but I don't know if that holds up if your assailant also has a weapon.
[19:10:14] <feep> or is too close.
[19:10:24] <feep> I think the presumption of that one is that like
[19:10:29] <feep> anyone holding a gun will be trained in its use.

Unless they are willing to remain single, these men will have to form unions with women who earn less than they do. Women, by contrast, will have to ‘settle’ less often for a lower-income partner. These differences in men’s and women’s marriage market opportunities are likely to not only create a right
[20:05:50] <feepbot> skew in the distribution of women’s contribution to household income, but also a discontinuity close to the 50/50 point. This occurs even if people are not more aversive of a situation in which the wife out-earns her husband than of a situation in which he out-earns her.' https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10680-019-09547-8

[23:11:06] <shawwwn> Ah, finally. Lovely sleep
[23:11:24] <shawwwn> Oh wow, it’s 2:40
[23:11:29] <shawwwn> Wait, it’s 1:40
[23:11:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> So. Stranger Things. Should I watch it? Is it good? Will I literally explode from D&D-gamer rage at the treatment of the source material?
[23:14:03] <gproto23> gwern how do you being interested in so many things? it seems so mysterious to me
[23:16:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_egg
[23:16:57] <Robomot> Scotch egg - Wikipedia (A Scotch egg is a boiled egg wrapped in sausage meat, coated in breadcrumbs and baked or deep-fried. …)
[23:17:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> "According to YouGov, Scotch eggs were found to be among Britain's least liked foodstuffs in 2019, ranking alongside bubble and squeak, Beef Wellington, Lancashire hotpot, pork pies and steak and kidney pies in the "Low tier" of British foods (50–59% in favour). Steak and kidney pudding, black pudding, kippers, liver and onions, haggis, faggots, laver bread and jellied eels ranked worse (<50%).[13] However in 2020, following
[23:17:01] <Obormot\Arcturus>  controversy as to whether Scotch eggs were considered a "substantial meal" (necessary for pubs, cafés and restaurants to stay open during the COVID-19 pandemic), more people began to buy the product.[14]"

[23:19:03] <Robomot> Faggot (food) - Wikipedia (Faggots are meatballs made from minced off-cuts and offal, especially pork (traditionally pig's heart, liver, and fatty belly meat or bacon) together with herbs for flavouring and sometimes added bread crumbs.[1] It is a traditional dish in the United Kingdom,[2][3] especially South and Mid Wales and the English Midlands.[1][4][5] …)
[23:19:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Man, no offense to the Brits here, but so much of y'all's food is just ... unappetizing
[23:19:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The "nose-to-tail eating" trend[clarification needed] has resulted in greater demand for faggots in the 21st century" ... what a sentence though

[23:20:05] <mst> admittedly of the 'ranked worse' list the only one I personally enjoy is black pudding and I can understand people who have a squick reaction to it once they know how it's made
[23:20:07] <shawwwn> gproto23: he has focused interests
[23:20:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In 2004, a radio commercial for the UK supermarket chain Somerfield, in which a man rejects his wife's suggested dinner saying "I've got nothing against faggots, I just don't fancy them" was found to have breached the Advertising and Sponsorship Code and was banned by the industry regulator Ofcom.[11][12] In November 2013, it was reported that British Facebook users had been blocked temporarily for using the word, in its
[23:20:25] <Obormot\Arcturus>  culinary sense, on the website. Facebook inaccurately said that the word had been "misinterpreted"."
[23:20:31] <mst> but I'm very confused by people disliking pork pies and scotch eggs
[23:21:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Scotch eggs seem like they might be quite dry
[23:21:30] <mst> in general those are both things that visitors from other countries (both .us and .sg that I can remember) have complained about missing as snack foods after they left
[23:21:43] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: that's hilarious tho
[23:22:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_and_squeak ... this seems like it could be delicious, actually
[23:22:07] <Robomot> Bubble and squeak - Wikipedia (Bubble and squeak is a British dish made from cooked potatoes and cabbage, mixed together and fried. The food writer Howard Hillman classes it as one of the "great peasant dishes of the world".[ …)
[23:23:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: I mean, the idea of "a whole egg wrapped in meat and breadcrumbs" on the one hand seems like obviously an excellent idea and on the other hand, on reflection, seems like it'd be fairly hard to make it so that it doesn't end up dry and flavorless
[23:23:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Does the egg usually end up being hardboiled? I feel like a softboiled egg would be a better result, but how to accomplish that?
[23:24:39] <gproto23> shawwwn but how he focus on many things? 
[23:24:48] <mst> hardboiled, usually, because it's fundamentally working class carryable food
[23:24:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... wait, you *start* with a hardboiled egg... which, yeah, makes sense in retrospect, but wow, that's gonna be dry as fuck
[23:25:02] <mst> though I've had a restaurant 'gourmet scotch egg' where the yolk was still runny
[23:25:09] <shawwwn> He doesn’t. He’s just lived a long life
[23:25:19] <shawwwn> Alternate answer: one day at a time
[23:26:14] <mst> also flavour-wise the meat plus the yolk mean that if it's done right it's pretty tasty
[23:26:30] <mst> and done less right it's still a highly effective portable protein delivery system
[23:26:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Fair enough
[23:27:26] <mst> mini scotch eggs (where it's basically diced boiled egg with a tiny amount of mayo for binding) are something I'll buy a pack of while walking to a pub as an effective bar snack
[23:27:44] <mst> there are a number of local bar staff who'
[23:27:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now that sounds good
[23:27:57] <mst> there are a number of local bar staff who're still vaguely surprised when they see me pairing my pint with anything else ;)
[23:28:13] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[23:28:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Upgrade that to an Olivier salad, wrap *that* in the ground meat and what have you, deep-fry it
[23:28:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> (sans the potatoes, I think)
[23:28:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> (that'd be extraneous)
[23:29:00] <mst> especially with your caveat, yeah that sounds like I'd love it
[23:29:43] <mst> but basically "if dryness is an issue then you forgot the pint" is pretty much my reaction to that (reasonable) observation ;)
[23:29:57] <gproto23> shawwwn have you ever met him personally?
[23:30:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Yep that makes sense
[23:30:54] <shawwwn> Yeah :) we had a short but intense love affair. He’s really quite a wonderful person, and he paid for every dinner
[23:31:09] <shawwwn> It’s a shame it didn’t work out, but totally understandable

[23:34:24] <gproto23> hmm.. so interesting
[23:35:05] <kuudes> (he's pulling your leg)
[23:38:01] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: stranger things doesn't really have much to do with d&d, there's just one or two scenes where they play it
[23:40:05] <gproto23> kuudes did you meet gwern too?
[23:40:11] <kuudes> no
[23:40:17] <saturn2> i'd say overall it's not worth watching though
[23:41:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Really? But, like, the villains or antagonists or w/e are famous D&D things!
[23:41:30] <superz_> have any of you guys eliminated cellphones from your lives?
[23:42:21] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: idk they're just random monsters
[23:42:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm
[23:42:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> superz_: I don't own a smartphone, AMA
[23:42:51] <feep> superz_: I am still excited at having gotten to *introduce* cellphones into my life
[23:43:01] <feep> like 12 years ago
[23:43:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Still got a cell phone in large part because my grandmother's old and she's gotta be able to reach me in case there's an emergency)
[23:43:11] <feep> 15*
[23:43:29] <feep> superz_: afaict having a cellphone has been an unalloyed good for me and has saved my sanity many times over
[23:43:47] <saturn2> unless you strongly object to them re-using the names, i don't see how it would matter how closely they resemble the d&d monsters
[23:43:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Also sometimes I gotta coordinate meeting with someone)
[23:44:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: I just ... ok I'll google it, thx
[23:44:56] <superz_> Obormot\Arcturus: the powers that be are removing 3G. So I'll be having to maybe upgrade my dumbphone. Do you have any recommendations?
[23:45:14] <superz_> ^ anyone else is free to respond to my Q.
[23:45:40] * mst basically never makes phone calls so moved his SIM into a 7" android tablet and just uses that
[23:45:45] <feep> imvho if you spend more than ~150€ you
[23:45:48] <feep> 're overspending
[23:46:07] <shawwwn> For what
[23:46:14] <feep> smartphone
[23:46:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> superz_: Um, sorry, I'm not up on the whole "G" thing. So you're saying you need a dumbphone that supports... whatever is after 3G?
[23:46:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> (4G...?)
[23:46:40] <feep> I just get a moto g? from one or two generations back
[23:46:47] <shawwwn> Yeah
[23:46:48] <feep> 4G.
[23:47:01] * Obormot\Arcturus looks up what his phone has
[23:47:15] <feep> every time I make a phone call with one I drop it down to edge
[23:47:20] <feep> because edge has better quality :v
[23:47:25] <feep> I dread the day they turn off 3G over here

[23:47:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> superz_: There you go
[23:48:32] <feep> oh, didn't see "dumbphone" sorry
[23:48:58] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: what was more maddening to me was that they all had walkie-talkies that worked almost like cell phones
[23:50:39] <saturn2> yes there were toy walkie-talkies back then but they had a range of like a block at best and lasted maybe an hour per set of batteries
[23:50:40] <superz_> most of the new dumbphones are basically smartphone lite
[23:51:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Oh when does it take place
