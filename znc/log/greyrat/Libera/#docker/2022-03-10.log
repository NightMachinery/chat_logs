[00:22:54] <cwchristerw> Its because . + .. = 8

[00:23:30] <cwchristerw> . has 2 files and .. has 6
[00:23:35] <cwchristerw> total 8
[00:23:46] <rawtaz> uh wait. im misunderstanding that. let me make myself less dumb, moment.
[00:23:56] <dobbicorp> if want my nginx+php container and  mysql container "talk" to each other what type of docker network should i create between them? bridge ?
[00:24:30] <dobbicorp> or ever... if php is separate container
[00:24:33] <dobbicorp> even*
[00:24:51] <dobbicorp> so. if i need to connect 3 containers, which network should i use?
[00:25:00] <ikke> dobbicorp: if you'd use something like docker-compose (which is recommended), you do not need to manually create anything)
[00:25:34] <ikke> But yes, a bridge network should suffice
[00:25:41] <dobbicorp> ikke: thank you
[00:26:08] <rawtaz> wow. it's "`total BLOCKS', where BLOCKS is the total disk allocation for all files in that directory"
[00:26:13] <rawtaz> never thought about that :O
[00:26:17] <rawtaz> cwchristerw: ^
[00:26:42] <ikke> And the min block size is 4
[00:26:45] <ikke> so 8 for 2 entries
[00:26:47] <ikke> I guess
[00:27:42] <rawtaz> cwchristerw: so; is it the apps/ directory that you feel is becoming empty after that docker command?
[00:27:57] <cwchristerw> Yes

[00:28:18] <rawtaz> why couldnt you just say that, when i asked you *so* many times already?

[00:29:38] <rawtaz> what about that data/ directory? it seems to be there both before and after. what are you missing about it?
[00:29:53] <cwchristerw> Yeah I didn't do line 45 and 53 to other folders
[00:30:02] <dobbicorp> ikke: ahh, looks like all the containers created without network params go to the default bridge network, neat :)

[00:36:06] <rawtaz> its not about being fast, it's about answering simple questions
[00:36:14] <cwchristerw> I also tested when creating container without bind mount it will not remove files as expected.
[00:36:27] <rawtaz> can you reproduce this problem if you remove lines 96-101  and re-run things?
[00:36:58] <rawtaz> when you say bind mount, which lines in the configuration are you referring to?
[00:37:13] <cwchristerw> Line 96-101
[00:37:18] <rawtaz> what does {{ infrastructure.docker.folder.config }} resolve to?
[00:37:34] <rawtaz> yeah ok. so lines 96-101 is what triggers the problem, correct?
[00:37:39] <cwchristerw> Its folder I have in my host
[00:37:58] <cwchristerw> Ansible is taking variables from inventories but those I cannot copy
[00:38:11] <cwchristerw> rawtaz, yes

[00:48:37] <dobbicorp> so, by default mysql docker image exposes 33060 port, what is the way to .. not expose it?
[00:48:43] <rawtaz> at first glance i dont really see why lines 96-101 should trigger the problem
[00:49:12] <ikke> dobbicorp: exposing is not equal to publishing it. Exposed ports are part of the image metadata
[00:49:30] <dobbicorp> i tried -p 127.0.0.1:3306:3306,127.0.0.1:33060:33060 and it failed to start the image ...
[00:49:44] <cwchristerw> rawtaz, I know it shouldn't but for reason it does

[14:12:06] <tabakhase> Tach a lot of it is down to understanding tbh :D -- as manifests and layers/actual data are kinda there own things and afaik there is no straight up way to see "who uses this layer" 
[14:13:27] <Tach> tabakhase it seems so indeed, so actually we are screwed by using it already ?
[14:14:46] <Tach> tabakhase I see people saying that a repo is a tag... which isn't
[14:21:31] <tabakhase> screwed already kinda depends on why/what/how you use it ;-) -- for a standalone registry everyone just pushes to, yea you kinda are :D ((thats where mentioned 3rd party stuff to find deleteable-tags comes in then (gitlab has that ambedded for example)) - for some other usecases i just blast in a s3 and rotate the entire storage every few months :D
[14:22:53] <Tach> tabakhase yap, everyone is pushing to it...

[14:26:21] <tabakhase> rotate as in literally "delete the storage, make a new one thats empty" and throw _everything_ away (its a buffer/cache/wip registry only and "current" is mirrored elsewhere)
[14:26:52] <Tach> tabakhase ok but what do you when you need images at that specific moment ?
[14:28:20] <tabakhase> well, you shouldnt :D  - everything thats in there should be rebuildable, and a handfull starters are mirrored elsewhere as mentioned

[14:34:02] <tabakhase> just not sure how useable that actually is in the end... gitlab can use the power of "knowing" about mergerequests and such to keep things open -- the docker hub even has information on "last pulled" -- but standalone-3rd-party got literally nothing...

[22:46:03] <programmerq> don't use 'docker commit'. use a dockerfile to build an image. in general, most docker commands can take a container name or id, including docker cp.
[22:46:21] <programmerq> docker cp copies data to/from a container, not an image
[22:46:30] <programmerq> docker commit creates an image (but again, you should use a Dockerfile to do this)
[22:46:53] <programmerq> to get files into an image with a Dockerfile, there's a COPY directive.

[22:49:40] <DoofusCanadensis> you use docker commit, but as programmerq states, that's not the recommended path

[22:49:54] <steerpike> oh, an imae

[22:50:12] <DoofusCanadensis> dockerfile guarantees reproducible images
[22:50:45] <programmerq> rty: I also pointed out that a container and image are different and that docker cp interacts with a container, not an image. presumably since you have been using docker commit, you know how to make an image from a container that you've made changes to.
[22:50:48] <steerpike> yeah, after you do a docker cp into a running container, you would do docker commit
[22:51:01] <programmerq> and yes, I did answer the question-- the answer is... don't use docker commit.
[22:51:21] <steerpike> why?

[22:51:30] <programmerq> the correct way to get files into an image is to use a Dockerfile and use the COPY directive.
[22:51:40] <DoofusCanadensis> repeatable builds
[22:52:16] <steerpike> does docker use unikernels out of the box?
[22:52:26] <DoofusCanadensis> containers are designed to be throwaway objects
[22:52:38] <ikke> steerpike: containers are not vms
[22:52:52] <ikke> they are processes that run on the host
[22:52:54] <steerpike> I'm aware
[22:53:04] <ikke> then the comment of unikernels does not really make sense
[22:53:21] <ikke> The host kernel is used
[22:53:25] <programmerq> steerpike: there was some talk about unikernels a few years back. as far as I know the current runtimes that docker supports don't do anything special for unikernels. They pretty much just run a binary that the host kernel is capable of running. if that binary happens to fit the description of a 'unikernel' then sure.
[22:53:47] <programmerq> unikernels can mean a few things and there are different projects that target different system types.

[22:54:46] <rty> I know. I don't need this functionality right now. I just need it to act as some state saved, as I said, I am using it as a living development environment, not as a reproducible number of (yet unknown to me, as it's a living environment) steps to get to the current state from some starting point. I am not here to argue about that. docker supports the mode that is suitable for me right now just
[22:54:48] <rty> fine. I just ask how to copy data into the system. I can git clone it from inside the container, sure, but surely there is a better way. that is all I am asking about. hmm, perhaps I need to run the image first to make it a container with hash
[22:55:25] <tabakhase> steerpike also moe on the "why" - there is a maximum number of layers, so you WILL have to restart soooner or later -- and "docker doesnt delete stuff" so this image will keep growing and growing --- commit rly IS the devil
[22:55:33] <tabakhase> what you may want, are simple bindmounts....
[22:55:34] <programmerq> a typical containerized development environment makes use of a Dockerfile
[22:55:49] <programmerq> in theory a unikernel-specific runtime could be implemented, but I'm not aware whether there's any OSS project that fits that description.
[22:56:07] <tabakhase> so, if your lanuage doesnt need compile or such, "docker run -v $PWD:/var/www/html php:apache" or such is a perfectly fine thing todo and a "dev env"
[22:56:21] <programmerq> back when I worked for docker, I recall some acquisition of a company that specialized in unikernel stuff but we never shipped anything specific to unikernels as far as I recall.
[22:56:40] <programmerq> yup, a bind mount is also quite common in containerized dev environments.

[23:07:10] <pizza> DoofusCan: just curious if i should install via their script, or use my distros package
[23:07:15] <rty> but you also mentioned differences between images and containers, so I guess it retrospect the answer was there
[23:07:22] <rty> I just do not know the terminology
[23:07:43] <pizza> i recall for docker that it isn't recommended to use your distro's package because it can be severely outdated, wondering if that's the same case
[23:08:02] <tabakhase> you literally said you are using "container_name" in your openiong post :P
[23:08:03] <ikke> pizza: it all depends on your usecase and what distro / base image you use
[23:08:18] <DoofusCan> pizza: oh good question... I use homebrew to install it on macOS so distro packaging should be okay unless you need something that hasn't been packaged yet
[23:08:25] <tabakhase> (and that for the record, totally works, so no need for hashes or anything https://i.imgur.com/HEQxdiA.png )
[23:09:18] <rty> yes, my bad. it was image_name
[23:09:29] <ikke> pizza: using pre-build packages can make your life a lot easier
[23:11:54] <programmerq> rty: don't complain about not being told stuff that you were told and ignored.
[23:12:19] <tabakhase> rty and the "use a dockerfile." isnt rly that much of a wrong suggestion... most cases where people try to copy somethign into a image it should be part of the build process, or bindmounted at runtime (say the php&apache example) -- cause cokmmit WILL fail, garanteed, there is a max number of layers you can stack before it just dies -- also "docker doesnt delete things" so the image will keep 
[23:12:20] <tabakhase> growing and growing and growing (so, you can not ever run say `apt-get upgrade´ in there, you MUST restart from the top - so having the dockerfile rly rly helps that along xD
[23:14:00] <rty> ok, perhaps when I figure out most dependencies I'll write a file
[23:16:28] <tabakhase> sure that, should be "almost as easy" as taking the bash_history from your construction-container and just putting a RUN infront of it when copypasting it into the dockerfile once youre done ((cause yea sure, for the "first build" having a more reactive shell to try things and investigate why a step failed and such can help a lot =)
