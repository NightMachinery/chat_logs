[02:01:36] <red_> I'm just curious as to what purpose it serves as opposed to tossing this on a single partition.
[02:01:42] <mpan> red_: probably intentionally and that sounds reasonable. Why would you need a larger root fs? Most things to to home for a typical user.

[02:02:59] <mpan> red_: your home fs may be shared across multiple distros, as an example. Also it may be encrypted without unnecessarily encrypting the rest of the system.
[02:03:43] <mpan> It’s also easier to make backups that way.
[02:03:55] <thurstylark> separated /home is pretty standard
[02:03:59] <red_> mpan: It's just strange because on endeavour (arch based), and on two other ubuntu based distros I don't remember seeing the partitions even listed

[02:04:18] <Namarrgon> didn't it ask you whether you wanted to split out /home?
[02:04:21] <red_> so I thought maybe I screwed something up in the installer (even though it's basically automatic)
[02:04:32] <thurstylark> and since that's where most user data ends up, it makes sense to give /home more space than /
[02:04:34] <red_> I don't believe so, no. it just asked if I wanted to add a user beyond root, which I did

[03:14:52] <mpan> Arch-based is not Arch.
[03:15:00] <Khorne> It's an entirely different repo and signing infrastructure than Arch's
[03:15:04] <BrainDamage> try asking debian for ubuntu support, see how well you'll be received
[03:15:14] <Scimmia> it's a different distro, period. The issue you are having isn't even related to Arch
[03:15:29] <AltReality> whatever. I'll look elsewhere. I love arch....but this is really disappointing.
[03:15:29] <thrice> this is actually a good example of WHY, it's something totally broken in your distro, but not arch

[05:33:14] <DrNefario> is there anything else a kernel update without reboot can cause issues with?
[05:34:12] <Edu4rdSHL> It's all about kernel modules that were not loaded before, mostly.
[05:34:40] <Edu4rdSHL> You can use the kernel-modules-hook package in the repos to avoid that
[05:34:49] <DrNefario> oh right, so updating the kernel basically just locks in all the modules until you reboot?

[06:14:17] <Myth> im mostly not used to other systems
[06:14:21] <TheDcoder> Though I wouldn't use it for a production critical server
[06:14:25] <Myth> arch is fundementally different in multiple ways
[06:14:40] <TheDcoder> Myth: why do you think so?
[06:14:55] <TheDcoder> Aside from the package manager, it's all the same stuff
[06:15:07] <Myth> theres no AUR, other package managers do things they shouldnt and dont do things they shouldn't do
[06:15:11] <TheDcoder> The best thing about arch is the package manager... followed by the wiki :P
[06:15:15] <jmariondev> yeah, in practice arch is actually pretty stable. but in the server space i would reach for Fedora (ideally CoreOS, but normal fedora too)
[06:15:18] <Myth> config files are stored in different places
[06:15:38] <Myth> jmariondev: i just need something that can run searx
[06:15:48] <Myth> arch seems the most compelling
[06:16:09] <jmariondev> run searx in a container, then run something boring as the server OS
[06:16:10] <TheDcoder> Myth: look up searx's documentation, they'll list their recommended distro
[06:16:28] <Myth> its ubuntu, centos 7 (ugh) and arch
[06:16:47] <TheDcoder> go for it
[06:16:58] <jmariondev> but if you're okay with the (very) occasional debug session, and you want to learn about how this all works, then arch would definitely be my choice
[06:17:32] <Myth> ive used arch for about two years now, its hard to switch back
[06:17:53] <jmariondev> i prefer containers for any workload nowadays though, the tech is plenty mature and it's better in almost every way

[06:27:14] <jmariondev> boiled way down, it's essentially a key-value store that you can put stuff in to describe what you want running, and it will spawn containers (in "pods) to make that happen
[06:27:32] <TheDcoder> Oh...
[06:27:32] <Scimmia> it's not even always about needing the old lib. It's about counting on dozens of different upstreams to update things like openssl instead of just updaing the system version and being done with it

[06:31:41] <TheDcoder> lol... the mistake one shouldn't do with static linking is to split it into multiple packages
[06:31:53] <TheDcoder> static should always be a single self-contained package
[06:32:16] <Scimmia> and containers don't even give you some of the major benefits of static linking, the speed and memory benefits if only one thing is using that lib

[06:35:20] <jmariondev> i have done the reading, it's my job to do so. containers absolutely have isolation benefits
[06:35:34] <TheDcoder> jmariondev: containers can give an illusion of security, but they still use the same kernel and can exploit the same bugs
[06:35:38] <jmariondev> not as strong as a full VM, but still much better than running every app in a single set of namespaces
[06:35:53] <sw0g4n> damn right jmariondev 
[06:36:04] <Scimmia> I said they provide some extra isolation. That's FAR from a hard wall

[06:37:45] <demonicmaniac1> that's anything but trivial
[06:37:53] <jmariondev> however the tools available to you can get very close to VM-level security. if your concern is the kernel attack surface, might I suggest limiting the way syscalls are made (especially if you can limit it to only the calls that the application requires)
[06:38:06] <TheDcoder> I know, but it's okay for internal components which don't rely on other external components
[06:38:36] <demonicmaniac1> i'd also like to cite libstdc++ issues in terms of static linking that

[06:40:10] <TheDcoder> jmariondev: none of us are claiming that namespaces are useless, but they aren't hard walls either

[06:41:03] <jmariondev> it sounds like we're otherwise in agreement though

[06:41:37] <TheDcoder> jmariondev: yes, we are basically in agreement

[07:51:56] <mpan> noobaroo: a practical note: Thunar will recognize archives that engrampa (and possibly file-roller, of which engrampa is the Xfce fork) can’t properly process if the file extension is wrong. Changing the file extension fixes that.

[07:54:59] <mpan> It’s Mate-specific counterpart to GNOME’s file-roller (sry, was wrong earlier saying it’s Xfce’s).
[07:55:31] <mpan> Just warning, as that behaviour is quite unexexpected for things that normally do not care about exensions and may be a bit confusing.

[11:31:17] <Strykar> it's literally for systems not using cron
[11:31:29] <mpan> Basically: both are valid solutions. The difference *on Arch* is that systemd is already mandated on Arch (cron is not) and Arch stuff in general is already very systemdish.
[11:31:47] <mpan> Strykar: because they document such a possibility.
[11:32:05] <Strykar> in the example that does not use cron? so weird
[11:32:23] <mpan> Strykar: oh, you mean the --cron switch? Probably that’s how the script knows it’s running in a timer fashion.

[11:57:01] <norbert> Strykar: cron has still it's valid use-cases. I think generating a service file and a timer for each cron job I want, I honestly prefer adding a single line in my crontab. That is not to say that system timers are bad, but not really the solution for everything. And the are much more burdensome then crontab lines.

[11:59:45] <mkoskar> Strykar: one reason to use cron (cronie/fcron) might be that it handles mailing by default, if you want the same with system timers you would need a bit extra effort, there are different approaches to it, e.g., extra onshot service that mails status on failure, but just writing a simple wrapper to might do better

[17:36:53] <Foxboron> MacGyver: if you use a bootloader as your UEFI binary, then that binary needs to validate and do stuff. But then it's not in the hands of UEFI anymore
[17:36:57] <thrice> nevermind, you seem like you're just trolling
[17:37:21] <MacGyver> Foxboron: Right, so that validation chain beyond secureboot is technically not secureboot anymore?

[17:37:52] <Foxboron> MacGyver: people usually talk about the "secure boot context" in this case
[17:38:09] <Foxboron> but when UEFI exits then the bootloader needs to followup, this is why you have seen 20-30 CVEs in grub around secureboot

[17:38:56] <Foxboron> MacGyver: sd-boot does everything correctly
[17:39:01] <Foxboron> and is a very simple bootloader, frankly
[17:39:37] <MacGyver> Yeah what I mean is, I'd like to read somewhere what "doing everything correctly" means as a writeup, rather than sd-boot's git commit log.
