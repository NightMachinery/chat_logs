[10:29:40] <cgenie[m]> hello, I got interested in exwm. Thing is, I sometimes do heavy stuff that keeps emacs working for a while, I don't want my WM to hang as well. What I usually do is spawn couple of emacs processes so that when I work on something, it doesn't block others. From what I see, in exwm the whole thing is just 1 big emacs session. I'm kind of worried that I'll block my wm with heavy emacs usage. What are your suggestions?
[10:30:04] <cgenie[m]> by heavy stuff I mean: large org files, org-roam and such, sometimes emacs just hangs
[10:30:11] <humasect> its great =) 
[10:30:26] <humasect> run emacs within exwm, i've had the same concern
[10:31:20] <cgenie[m]> yes but won't the keybindings mix up?
[10:31:22] <humasect> the shortcuts works well for arbitrary window depth (emacs within emacs within exwm for eg.) someone in here shown me how.
[10:31:52] <ecraven> cgenie[m]: I only run one emacs, some things can be improved with the various async libraries, in some cases, I just live with it
[10:32:06] <ecraven> if you run your "inside" emacs in char-mode in exwm, then most keybindings should work fine
[10:32:16] <cgenie[m]> I also get a question "replace existing window manager?" when running emacs
[10:32:30] <humasect> i've exwm for a couple years, happy

[12:18:18] <parsnip> ,marmalade
[12:18:18] <fsbot> marmalade is [0] spreadable elisp at https://marmalade-repo.org
[12:18:19] <fsbot> [1] the  elisp based project https://github.com/nicferrier/elmarmalade
[12:18:19] <fsbot> [2] add to your emacs with (add-to-list 'package-archives '("marmalade" . "https://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))
[12:18:45] <jbe> they are two different repositories with two different mission statements
[12:19:42] <akiosakuro> Okay. But I can install from both PPAs using 'use-package'?
[12:19:58] <jbe> but yeah, in a way, gnu elpa is "more official", and has packages that I guess would be considered "core" to emacs, but may need to have more frequent releases than emacs itself
[12:19:59] <wasamasa> ,marmalade is also dead (certificate expired, timing out, maintainer no longer interested in keeping it going)

[12:20:45] <wasamasa> use-package just obscures that they're both package archives
[12:21:11] <wasamasa> which package archive you can install from depends on what you've set `package-archives' to

[22:57:12] <parsnip> i wish my oven was insulated
[22:57:16] <parsnip> more
[22:57:35] <rpav> i think you can but worth investing in like an air roaster or something .. a few hundred $$ but then you can buy coffee at $4-5/lb
[22:57:39] <technomancy> my wife got me this for my birthday https://www.sweetmarias.com/fresh-roast-sr540.html
[22:57:59] <technomancy> it's really fun
[22:58:07] <rpav> yeah we had one of those and i used it for years til it broke and i got the sr800
[22:58:18] <technomancy> you can do it in a stovetop pan but it's really hard to avoid burning it
[22:58:36] <rpav> yeah probably pretty hard to get an even roast, or even do very much at a time
[22:58:37] <bpalmer> roto: at another level, just have one trusted person set up a shared google form that writes into a spreadsheet

[23:08:45] <bpalmer> mawk: it's dependent on the scheme, but not necessarily.
[23:09:04] <mawk> I mean not too many in number, I mean too many different kinds
[23:09:34] <bpalmer> mawk: one of the usual worries with homomorphic schemes is the bootstrap issue: if you can track the average of a salary, and you track it from when there's one row and then the second row, at each i'th row you can know every value beforehand
[23:10:03] <mawk> like how you can recover personal info from census data so they have to make it fuzzy
[23:10:14] <mawk> ah I see
[23:11:44] <bpalmer> ah, I think the census thing is similar, where if you allow many fine grained queries , the underlying values can be picked out. 
[23:12:00] <mawk> or like if you can add and multiply the data in enough different ways, you can get a polynomial that passes through the data points
[23:12:05] <mawk> yes that

[23:14:43] <bremner> just do an apendectomy. everybody wants one
[23:14:55] <rpav> mawk: no more like, your "set of instructions" is a series of "perform this byte mapping"
[23:14:56] <mawk> I don't

[23:15:34] *** Quits: eqw (~eqw@31.134.178.99) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[23:15:58] <rpav> like you have a series of bytes whose values mean something to the 3rd party, and a series of operations which are like OpX: { 0xNN => 0xMM } and a series of instructions that are like "OpX on this byte, OpY on that byte, move based on OpZ" etc
[23:16:07] <mawk> on a set of 3 data points, if you can get the arithmetic average, the geometric average, and the harmonic average, three perfectly natural operations to do on data, then you can recover the original points
[23:16:20] *** Joins: eqw (~eqw@31.134.178.99)
[23:16:37] <rpav> mawk: well my specific goal is to perform computations for a third party without having any knowledge of the underlying data or computation etc, _just_ that you're doing compute for them
[23:16:51] <mawk> yes I see
[23:17:08] <mawk> but then you would have sensitive info on the data yourself

[23:17:45] <mawk> if you can do any kind of operation
[23:17:55] <bpalmer> mawk: most known homomorphic schemes that I know of are robust against particular sets of operations. Not arbitrary math.
[23:17:58] <hodapp> and on a set of 3 data points, if you tell me the index of the median, the index of the minimum, and the index of the maximum, then you can recover... uh... absolutely nothing because it's order statistics
[23:18:32] <hendursaga> When compiling Emacs, do I have to explicitly configure with SVG support, by passing --with-rsvg?
[23:19:08] <hendursaga> Or does it automagically configure with it, unless, perhaps, librsvg-dev or whatnot isn't installed at the time of compilation?
[23:19:10] <mawk> doesn't the output of configure tell you what is enabled?
[23:19:25] <rpav> mawk: would you? i mean probably but i'm curious if such is ever possible, or if compute is basically inherently leaky
[23:19:26] <hendursaga> Yeah but I compiled this months ago
[23:19:28] <bpalmer> hodapp: that's not fully true; suppose the index of hte maximum is the same as the index of the minimum

[23:21:50] <hendursaga> (image-type-available-p 'svg) returns t, but I don't have any svg-* functions, which is confusing
[23:22:02] <rpav> mawk: i think i can sortof at least hand-wavily see .. but what if you don't know how to average, or what any of the data is, or what computations you are actually given to perform?
[23:22:25] <rpav> mawk: doesn't that example require you know you're working with rows of data, and that you know what a certain operation is doing?
[23:22:28] *** Joins: Guest67 (~Guest67@168.235.181.114)
[23:22:32] <mawk> if you know that you are doing averages, and you know the result, then you can recover the three initial values
[23:22:50] <bpalmer> hendursaga: (require 'svg)
[23:22:59] <hendursaga> bpalmer: I literally just did that, haha
[23:23:10] <mawk> if you don't know in which order the averages are then you get 6 possible choices for the initial values, you'd choose the most plausible one
[23:23:21] <bpalmer> hendursaga: there's a difference between whether something like insert-image supports SVG, and being able to do svg-specific things (like dynamically generating SVG)
[23:23:21] *** Quits: jje (~jje@user/jje) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:23:35] <rpav> yeah so what i'm saying is what if you _don't_ know what operations you can perform, only that you have a series of "operations" that are value mappings that have some result that's meaningful to the keyholder
[23:23:43] *** Joins: jje (~jje@user/jje)

[23:25:09] <rpav> well of course, but the keyholder is the "trusted" party, and my only goal is to have an untrusted 3rd party do some series of opaque operations on opaque data, but not be able to learn anything from it
[23:26:19] <mawk> yes then it's totally fine
