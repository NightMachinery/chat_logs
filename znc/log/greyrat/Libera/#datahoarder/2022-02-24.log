[01:17:20] <skye0> upgrading from an RX 570 8 GB to GTX 1070 8GB to get a better frame rate on Halo Infinite as well as CUDA capabilities on a max budget of 300 or 400 GBP, is it worth it?
[01:17:47] <evilgohan2> A GTX 1070 is 400 quid in 2022?
[01:17:49] <evilgohan2> this fucking market man...
[01:22:47] <skye0> i found one for 250 gbp but that's not impossible sadly
[01:23:30] <skye0> two more days or so until payday but i'm kind of at a loss on what to buy
[01:25:25] <evilgohan2> completed bids show recent sales in the 260 gbp range for GTX 1080s

[01:25:53] <evilgohan2> alternatively, you could look in the RTX 2000 range
[01:26:33] <evilgohan2> This listing is still active for an RTX 2070 Super (would recommend) and is below your 400 mark

[01:55:40] <ThePendulum> I don't know what it can offer that AW and Second Life didn't as early as the 90s
[01:55:52] <joepie91> more capitalism and creepy surveillance
[01:55:56] <ThePendulum> sure we didn't have goggles back then, but is that really going to make the difference?
[01:56:17] <joepie91> hm
[01:56:21] <joepie91> is there a VR client for Second Life yet?
[01:57:33] <ThePendulum> apparently there's a mod for Firestorm but that goes via SteamVR
[01:57:49] <ThePendulum> I haven't really dabbled in goggle VR so I don't really know what that implies
[01:57:55] <joepie91> iirc the SL client was open-source or something, I don't recall the specifics
[01:58:36] <ThePendulum> yeah it's been a while, I think Firestorm is the one I used for my own server but I don't know why I preferred t hat over SL Viewer
[01:59:12] <ThePendulum> I still haven't recovered from 3DEE going offline lol

[05:20:59] <evilgohan2> I tried it, but it just didn't work out for me.
[05:21:25] <ThePendulum> only thing I don't like is that I can't just add a raw video folder, but I remember plex being pretty bad at that as well
[05:21:35] <ThePendulum> so put it in my library, but don't try to parse it as movies or series
[05:21:57] <sarnold> I'm surprised amsterdam cops had a car to drive into the guy. I expected bikes.
[05:22:13] <evilgohan2> Yea, I haven't seen anything that can handle raw media folders very well since SageTV

[05:32:51] <evilgohan2> I'm at the point where I just want stuff to work
[05:33:03] <evilgohan2> I drop media in a directory, I wanna sit in front of my TV, open the app, and press play.
[05:33:11] <evilgohan2> If it's more complicated than that, I'm gonna be annoyed.
[05:34:03] <ThePendulum> yeah, any easier than that I'll be annoyed to. if it's exactly right I'm still annoyed
[05:34:06] <ThePendulum> but I'd appreciate if they tried
[05:35:36] <evilgohan2> I just think of how much stuff I've tried over the years
[05:35:53] <evilgohan2> Windows Media Center stretching from Windows XP MCE to Windows 7 Ultimate just to get Media Center working (with TV Tuners)
[05:35:57] <evilgohan2> XBMC
[05:36:14] <evilgohan2> SageTV - which actually worked for years for me until they decided to kill support
[05:36:31] <evilgohan2> Hell, Catalyst Media Center was in there at one point.
[05:36:33] <evilgohan2> (and it sucked)
[05:36:54] <evilgohan2> Then flip-flopping between Emby and Plex until I settled on Plex due to DVR / TV Tuner support, and it handling music far better than Emby was for me.

[05:37:53] <evilgohan2> If they could do something about their constant API issues screwing with logins, that'd be nice.

[08:40:17] <superkuh> Sounds good. Install some linux, install nginx from repos, off you go.
[08:40:23] <rawktucc> no need for nginx
[08:40:35] <rawktucc> just install linux, setup ssh, and use sshfs or filezilla with sftp
[08:40:39] <rawktucc> or whatever windows has these days
[08:40:40] <rawktucc> easy
[08:41:22] <rawktucc> sorry superkuh . nginx can definitely be used, i failed to consider the ease of autoindex for serving files from a LAN server host
[08:41:23] <superkuh> I can't imagine something that small being used as a bulk data storage device. I assumed a server serving things to the internet. Could be either I guess.

[21:41:02] <ThePendulum> I ordered a waffle iron from them two months ago
[21:41:09] <joepie91> I'm surprised they still have customers tbh
[21:41:12] <ThePendulum> it wasn't in stock so I canceled it a month ago
[21:41:20] <joepie91> lol
[21:43:20] <joepie91> ThePendulum: we need a tweakers pricewatch for Everything
[21:43:28] <joepie91> beslist/kieskeurig are a trashfire

[23:18:09] <sarnold> https://globe.adsbexchange.com/ no queue, and pretty quiet over ukraine and belarus
[23:20:54] <ThePendulum> nice 
[23:20:57] <ThePendulum> what's that domain 
[23:22:06] <joepie91> lol
[23:22:22] <joepie91> that domain will never stop looking like an ad server to me
[23:22:34] <joepie91> ThePendulum: also I've definitely seen a Dutch military helicopter show up on FR24 before
[23:24:03] <ThePendulum> oh ADS-B, right lol
[23:25:39] <ThePendulum> hm yeah but probably during a military mission
[23:25:47] <ThePendulum> I guess technically they're all missions 
[23:30:12] <sarnold> adsbexchange doesn't do any filtering to remove flights, like fr24 does -- as a consequence, they can't get the flight plans, just the data from receivers
[23:30:27] <skye0> who knows what could be derived from the lack of information?
[23:31:06] <skye0> militaries wanting to cover up their advances? flights directed away from the airspaces of those countries because of the situation? or something else?
[23:32:02] <sarnold> ukraine closed their airspace sometime yesterday
[23:32:31] <sarnold> and everyone had been avoiding belarus for months, after they forced down a flight to arrest someone
[23:32:54] <sarnold> (there were still direct flights in and out of belarus, but no more overflights by anyone except aeroflot, I think)
[23:33:51] <skye0> ah, explains those
