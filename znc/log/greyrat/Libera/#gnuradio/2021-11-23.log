[05:07:18] <miek> why `depth * i`? shouldn't that just be `depth`?
[05:08:53] <drmpeg> I guess so. I took the code from somewhere else.
[05:09:33] <drmpeg> But it was for a much smaller queue.

[17:03:09] <funkylab[m]> > I guess you need to introduce it somehow through the module headers in include/
[17:03:09] <funkylab[m]> yes.
[17:03:37] <funkylab[m]> mcan06[m]: you built against a different version of UHD than is found when loading GNU Radio. 
[17:04:34] <funkylab[m]> reason in 99.5% of cases (rough estimate, but definitely not kidding) is that you have two competing installations of UHD. Find both, uninstall the one you don't want, clean your build folder, build and install a fresh GNU Radio.
[17:04:37] <jemius> funkylab[m], yeah, but if I define `int foo;` there then it will not be identical with the one in the class... the stuff even compiles when there is no "foo" in class
[17:04:54] <funkylab[m]> jemius: then it's a different class.
[17:05:12] <jemius> No, it is not
[17:05:23] <funkylab[m]> funkylab[m]: **HOWEVER** this seems to be a GNU Radio that depends on Python2, so I'm not sure why you want to build that from source :)
[17:05:41] <funkylab[m]> jemius: well, the problem you're having says the compiler thinks it's a different class.
[17:06:27] <jemius> funkylab[m], but it does find the methods, and uses them correctly
[17:06:48] <funkylab[m]> I'm a bit confused with what you mean with "not identical with the one in the class", because, defining a member `int foo;` in the class is the one place where you can define members, so it, by definition, is what the class is
[17:07:39] <jemius> funkylab[m], say: there is `int foo` in lib/myblock.h, and there is `int foo` in include/mymod/myblock.h – these two are not identical
[17:07:48] <jemius> And it compiles when the later is missing... so.
[17:07:56] <funkylab[m]> what
[17:08:37] <funkylab[m]> but any given `#include "myblock.h"` or `#include "mymod/myblock.h"` will only include either of the files
[17:08:45] <funkylab[m]> so what you write into the other doesn't matter. 
[17:09:04] <funkylab[m]> I will say having two headers of identical name in two places in your OOT is a recipe for confusion!
[17:09:22] <jemius> That's what gr_modtool generates. Not me
[17:09:29] <funkylab[m]> hm, no
[17:09:52] <funkylab[m]> gr_modtool generates `lib/myblock_impl.h` and `include/mymod/myblock.h`
[17:10:20] <funkylab[m]> or wait
[17:10:30] <funkylab[m]> *how* recent is your `gr_modtool`?
