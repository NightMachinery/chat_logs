[04:33:01] <krismatrix> what do you guys do, when you want to return an array, but also may return undef (for null) and on the other end you want to do a join ?
[04:33:23] <krismatrix> I mean..there are a few solutions, i can think of but none of them are single line ones.
[04:33:42] <mst> why would you return undef rather than an empty array?
[04:33:57] <kiwiroy> krismatrix: is there a difference for you?
[04:34:00] <krismatrix> hmm..i guess i could return an empty array.
[04:34:04] <kiwiroy> mst types faster.
[04:34:07] <krismatrix> just return ()
[04:34:09] <krismatrix> ?
[04:34:35] <mst> unless you need to distinguish between 'an empty array' and 'no return array at all'
[04:35:06] <mst> but if you're just join()ing the results normally, meh
[04:35:06] <krismatrix> no..i got what i wanted. thank you.

[04:43:43] <Grinnz> not to keep harping on it but it could quickly become relevant: you're not returning an array there but a list, and when you return undef that's just a list containing a single undef, which is a problem if that's something you'd normally return in the list
[04:44:27] <Grinnz> if you want to distinguish empty array from null, you should instead return an arrayref and call it in scalar context, then you can determine whether the result is defined before dereferencing it
[04:44:40] <Grinnz> but if you don't need to, then empty list is fine

[15:28:47] <simcop2387> LeoNerd: yea i imagine the infix stuff will be very experimental for a release or two before it's generally useful, but it enables so much so i'm hopeful it'll land and not be a smartmatch
[15:29:21] <simcop2387> combined with a normal keyword, it could let things like a small DSL for LINQ like stuff to be done
[15:36:00] <LeoNerd> simcop2387: I've been using them already myself
[15:36:47] <simcop2387> cool
[15:38:39] <LeoNerd> equ especially since it plays with SKM even on "normal" perls
[15:38:58] <LeoNerd> It's nice to be able to  case(undef)  and have it be different to the empty string
[15:40:25] <simcop2387> that's interesting.  so it's embeddable inside a module essentially?

[16:39:37] <Altreus> god I hate TO_JSON

[16:41:13] <LeoNerd> sub as_hashref_without_sensitive_fields { ... }  *TO_JSON = \&as_hashref_without_sensitive_fields;
[16:41:19] <Altreus> yes
[16:41:25] <Altreus> but this allows people to write sub TO_JSON
[16:41:36] <Altreus> if it were an attribute you would be FORCED to write an actual method
[16:41:58] <LeoNerd> Are you saying we need a proper coërcion mechanism? ;)
[16:42:08] <Altreus> Object::Tagged?
[16:42:24] <LeoNerd> Sounds like quite a reëngineering effort
[16:42:37] <LeoNerd> But with enough coöperation between authors we should be able to manage it
[16:42:40] <Altreus> my $invoice = $customer->invoices->first but not Jsonable
[16:42:52] <Altreus> :P
[16:42:58] <Altreus> does such coöperation exist?
[16:43:01] <LeoNerd> "but not" would be an interesting annotation
[16:43:26] <Altreus> I will always maintain that it is the *view* code that knows how to turn a thing into JSON, not the thing itself
[16:43:28] <LeoNerd> 1 but not True
[16:43:36] <Altreus> different views need different representations of the same model
[16:43:51] <Altreus> TO_JSON is just a refactor waiting to happen
[16:44:16] <Altreus> also you have to remember about it when you wonder how the hell this object turns into that API response :)
[16:44:40] <choroba> well... if you need strings versus numbers in JSON, view is too late

[16:45:04] <Altreus> choroba: nono, not the thing rendering the JSON, the thing creating the data to be rendered

[19:41:04] <The_Blode> Hey guys, Blode here again.
[19:41:10] <mst> .o/
[19:41:16] <The_Blode> Hello :)
[19:41:54] <The_Blode> My colleague asks me "is Perl a synchronous language" I told her it generally is but it does have some async capability. Not at it's core though.
[19:42:00] <The_Blode> Was I wrong or completely wrong?
[19:42:18] <mst> that's about right, yes
[19:42:19] <The_Blode> I think someone here told me about Async modules once.
[19:42:39] <mst> though it's also sort of a strange question
[19:42:52] <The_Blode> Yeah I answered the best I could
[19:42:54] <mst> because most parts of most languages are synchronous
[19:43:07] <The_Blode> True
[19:43:23] <The_Blode> How was your day mst
[19:43:23] <mst> perl is generally single threaded, but you -can- write perl that's just as async as node.js code
[19:43:32] <Grinnz> javascript would be an example of a language that's more asynchronous at its core, but there's still plenty of sync code written there
[19:43:50] <mst> the difference is node.js people tend to write things async by default
[19:43:57] <daemon> hey all would these be equivalent: https://dpaste.org/bbAP
[19:43:57] <huf> apart from having a default event loop always there, isnt it the same as perl?
[19:43:58] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ dpaste/bbAP (Python) ]
[19:44:01] <mst> whereas in perl people tend to only write things async if they think it's actually useful
[19:44:19] <Grinnz> you can write things async in core perl with a select or poll loop, it's just annoying to do
[19:44:41] <daemon> been a while since I did a real select loop, normally see them more in crappy http worms infected php servers
[19:44:45] <daemon> well that was the last one I seen at least
[19:44:47] <mst> daemon: is 'unencode' in the curl line a typo?
[19:44:51] <The_Blode> Did Larry write Perl with async operations in mind?
[19:44:54] <daemon> mst, yep
[19:45:01] <Grinnz> The_Blode: unlikely
[19:45:03] <daemon> The_Blode, no
[19:45:10] <The_Blode> Got it
[19:45:14] <mst> The_Blode: however he did write perl to be very flexible
[19:45:17] <Grinnz> raku definitely has it in mind, though - moreso threading than general async
[19:45:22] <huf> not particularly relevant, the language has expanded over the years
[19:45:30] <mst> The_Blode: we can add things on cpan other languages have to have in their core binary or not at all
[19:45:34] <The_Blode> What's the difference between threading and async ops?
[19:45:35] <huf> and long long ago it became entirely general purpose
[19:45:52] <daemon> yikes curl's man page is enourmous
[19:46:05] <huf> this is in part because curl is slightly ridiculous
[19:46:12] <huf> i mean, telnet support? :D
[19:46:26] <daemon> :P true
[19:46:27] <The_Blode> cURL is highly extensible (I think that's the word)
[19:46:32] <thrig> daemon: another way would be to point both at a test webserver and log the requests
[19:46:43] <daemon> thrig, oh yeah I can just ncat -lv it
[19:46:44] <mst> or use whatever curl's debug option is
[19:46:47] <daemon> thrig++ # ta
[19:46:54] <The_Blode> cURL has high overheads

[20:08:39] <thrig> otherwise this ain't Java
[20:09:04] <Altreus> if big macs were standardised and neat that would be an improvement
[20:09:43] <The_Blode> Thanks rindolf 
[20:09:53] <The_Blode> Straight away, I see something interesting; Code without indentation is harder to read and so should be avoided. The Wikipedia article lists several styles - pick one and follow it
[20:10:04] <The_Blode> My senior colleague swears by having no identation.
[20:10:08] <huf> what
[20:10:11] <huf> is this a bit?
[20:10:12] <The_Blode> Which is the right approach here?
[20:10:48] <The_Blode> Who me or Alt?
[20:11:08] <mst> The_Blode: perltidy indents for you, whether you like it or not
[20:11:09] <The_Blode> I was just referring to the fact I produce code in an assembly line format.
[20:11:12] <Altreus> is it a bit or is it a lot?
[20:11:13] <mst> The_Blode: this is one of the advantages
[20:11:17] <rindolf> The_Blode: you're welcome . i suggest using perltidy
[20:11:26] <The_Blode> Thanks let me check it out
[20:11:40] <The_Blode> Much to the chagrin of my colleagues
[20:11:42] <huf> just cant imagine preferring unindented code, that's the sign of a sick mind
[20:12:06] <The_Blode> It's difficult to code review for sure
[20:12:19] <huf> cant tell the difference between potatoes and up sick, not kills puppies for fun sick
[20:12:21] <The_Blode> These seem like great resources thank you all
[20:12:43] <thrig> there's not much to indent in asm
[20:12:55] <huf> i'd make a bloody good try 
[20:13:17] <mst> thrig: I tend to find in asm I comment every line and indent the comments
[20:13:19] <The_Blode> Also, while I am here, I tend to be very verbose with my comments. I comment every single line and describe what it does. I do it for myself (my own sanity), and to make the code readable by anyone despite their skill. What are your thoughts on verbose comments and not used sparingly
[20:13:44] <mst> The_Blode: I tend to comment -why- things are done the way they are
[20:13:49] <mst> but it's all a matter of taste
[20:13:54] <huf> that's the only really important kind of comment
[20:13:58] <huf> and you almost never get it :D
[20:14:09] <thrig> oh actually I do indent: https://github.com/thrig/scripts/tree/master/asm/Darwin/amd64/echo.s
[20:14:10] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ scripts/echo.s at master · thrig/scripts · GitHub <https://github.com/thrig/scripts/blob/master/asm/Darwin/amd64/echo.s> ]
[20:14:11] <mst> my one big problem with 'lots of comments' is that it's annoyingly easy for somebody to modify the code later and forget to update the comments
[20:14:16] <choroba> I don't like it. I only expect comments at lines that do something complex or unexpected
[20:14:19] <The_Blode> Ah ok I see
[20:14:39] <Grinnz> overuse of comments, as with anything, can lead to them being ignored
[20:15:05] <Grinnz> if the comment is just restating what the code says then it's unnecessary - if it's explaining why or how it does it, then it's useful
[20:15:15] <mst> The_Blode: there's nothing quite so sad as ending up writing a script whose sole purpose is to delete all of the comments from a codebase because so many of them were wrong they were causing more problems than they solved - that's an extreme version of the problem, of course, but it was not one of my favourite days at work and it left an impression on me
[20:15:30] <The_Blode> When I use comments on each line, I describe the line in plain English / psuedo code logic
[20:15:37] <ehuelsmann[m]> The_Blode: the only comments i add are those where context is not apparent from the directly surrounding code.
[20:16:02] <Grinnz> at a certain point you have to rely on yourself and the person reading the code having learned the language a little bit :)
[20:16:03] <mst> yeah. the problem is when somebody changes the line, doesn't change the comment, and it gets missed at code review because the new code is correct and all the tests pass
[20:16:05] <The_Blode> Got it thank you guys
[20:16:25] <mst> note: this is not me saying comments are bad, only that comments *can* turn out to be technical debt themselves
[20:16:42] <mst> that's why I prefer to explain the 'why' in comments, and prove the 'what' by writing tests
[20:16:45] <Grinnz> also, if you feel you need to explain certain simple statements it may be an indication that you could rewrite it in a more intuitive (to you) way
[20:16:50] <mst> tests break if I forget to update them (hopefully)
[20:16:59] <huf> mst: well about that... :D
[20:17:02] <choroba> To paraphrase Torvalds, using comments is a code smell ;-)
[20:17:08] <mst> huf: *hopefully*
[20:17:15] <The_Blode> Could I paste you some sample Perl code so you can judge it?
[20:17:19] <mst> sure
[20:17:22] <The_Blode> To let me know what you think of my commenting style
[20:17:31] <The_Blode> Ok give me a moment.
[20:17:32] <huf> mst: recently had a test break after we did some schema changes but fixed to code so it'd return the same datastructure
[20:17:36] <thrig> meanwhile the Go codebase is kind of light on comments and heavy on one-and-two letter variable names
[20:17:37] <huf> tests still broke :D
[20:17:46] <huf> because they hadnt been updated in like 5 years 
[20:17:46] <The_Blode> I kinda hate that Linux Mint doesn't have WinSCP
[20:17:59] <thrig> ... three pages later, what the heck is "ct" ??
[20:18:19] <mst> yeah, I really dislike the old-school-C style of really short variable names like that
[20:18:51] <Altreus> choroba: to paraphrase me, Torvalds can go fuck himself
[20:18:58] <thrig> if they fit on the screen, sure, but if it's a few hundred lines later...
[20:19:34] <huf> the same two letter variable spanning hundreds of lines?
[20:19:36] <huf> oh good.
[20:19:49] <ehuelsmann[m]> True, although functions generally should not be hundreds of lines

[20:25:24] <thrig> 20% is practically nobody
[20:25:33] <huf> and the comment about incrementing the counter... there's literally a joke like that floating around the net
[20:25:35] <The_Blode> Yeah :-) in my defense, this was written a few years back so I have grown in my knowledge and strict is mandatory for my scripts nowadays.
[20:25:42] <mst> The_Blode: however, per-section comments like that aren't that bad an idea
[20:26:31] <The_Blode> Thank you mst
[20:26:37] <mst> heere's some deliberately scripty code I wrote recently: http://paste.scsys.co.uk/596048
[20:26:37] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ magnet_web paste from Someone at 217.168.150.38... ]
[20:26:51] <The_Blode> Let's have a gander
[20:27:41] <Altreus> The_Blode: you'll start to use comments like that less and less as you start to hear those words in your head when you read the code anyway
[20:28:07] <The_Blode> Yeah I think I do it now just out of habit rather than any utility.
[20:28:11] <The_Blode> I should probably stop.
[20:28:26] <Altreus> letting the reader not bother reading the code, though, is what mst's does
[20:28:39] <mst> notice that I'm describing the -purpose- of each section, rather than exactly -what- it does
[20:28:45] <thrig> our $blood; # out, out damned spot
[20:28:46] <The_Blode> mst I've noticed something quirky let's say in your code. It has a single line space inbetween each line almost. Was that a stylistic choice?
[20:29:19] <mst> The_Blode: it's whitespace -between sections- that I'm doing there
[20:29:23] <Altreus> The_Blode: specifically, if I read through all your comments, nothing tells me *what* it does, only *how* it does it
[20:29:45] <The_Blode> Yeah that's true. The comments don't give much value for sure.
[20:30:17] <Altreus> If I read through the code it tells me that it searches (with regex on HTML) for various strings and outputs them in a sort of table-like format
[20:30:17] <The_Blode> In later scripts, I would be more helpful "Define a variable to help us store the URLs for processing!"
[20:30:20] <The_Blode> Or something similar
[20:30:26] <mst> notice that when there's a number of lines that are one logical 'thing'
[20:30:32] <mst> I don't have spaces between them
[20:30:43] <Altreus> Yeah, if you're commenting a variable you should give people an idea of why they might change it, for instance
[20:31:02] <Altreus> # Various regexes that might find a horoscope
[20:31:11] <The_Blode> Yeah this script isn't a terribly good example of the benefit of verbose comments
[20:31:23] <The_Blode> That comment is just awful
[20:31:28] <Altreus> right, but that's how we learn :)
[20:31:29] <thrig> # do not call this when mercury is in retrograde
[20:31:33] <The_Blode> Looking back at that, here's how I would write it.
[20:31:46] <Altreus> url => regex? :D
[20:32:19] <Altreus> for my ($url, $regex) (@url_regex_pairs) {  # :D
[20:32:24] <The_Blode> # This line will search the webpage for Horoscope patterns
[20:32:29] <The_Blode> Or something like that
[20:32:32] <mst> The_Blode: it's also notable that most of the rest of the same file doesn't bother with comments, because each subroutine is about half a dozen lines where it's (hopefully) obvious what it's doing
[20:32:47] <The_Blode> True
[20:33:05] <Altreus> Although I do find that comments like mst's often find their way into the POD anyway, since it describes the behaviour of the method
[20:33:06] <mst> example: http://paste.scsys.co.uk/596049
[20:33:07] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ magnet_web paste from Someone at 217.168.150.38... ]
[20:33:34] <Altreus> needs idiot line
[20:33:35] <The_Blode> Did Paperbot leak my IP? lol
[20:34:22] <Altreus> It's not a leak if you're using a sieve
[20:36:12] <Grinnz> the paste site stores the IP of the paster, except that i believe it isnt actually your ip anymore
[20:37:14] <mst> The_Blode: that's the IP of the reverse proxy
[20:37:43] <Grinnz> but visiting literally any website will "leak" your ip to that server, that's how internet works
[20:38:32] <mst> yeah, "trying to hide your IP" is basically a thing children do because they think it matters, there's not actually any realistic way to do it on the wider internet without a -lot- of work
[20:38:37] <mst> and even then it usually doesnt work
[20:39:46] <Grinnz> hooray, i did some random shit and WSL works again
[20:39:49] <Grinnz> windows is great
[20:39:53] <The_Blode> That's true. Well, when I first arrived here 6 months ago, they guys told me I should wear a cloak to protect my IP. I wasn't fussed really. The guys on IRC are the good guys right
[20:40:24] <mst> whichever guys told you that were dumb
[20:40:39] <mst> the people who run the network will always tell you cloaks don't do that
[20:40:47] <thrig> last I used Windows the Firewall would popup a warning (to a non-Admin user) that Outlook was maybe a naughty program, sometimes
[20:40:49] <Grinnz> its just something irc servers do because lots of people think it matters, and at a small level it does lower the attack surface of random ip scrapers
[20:41:21] <The_Blode> Also, somebody sniffed my open ports too
[20:41:24] <Grinnz> but doing something malicious with your ip depends on you fucking up otherwise first
[20:41:31] <The_Blode> I mean, I haven't had this kind of treatment on other social networks lol
[20:41:55] <Grinnz> thrig: at least it's honest
[20:41:58] <mst> The_Blode: the irc network checks open ports as you connect to it, it even tells you it's doing it
[20:41:59] <The_Blode> We debated whether IP has any true connection to a person and whether it alone can be useful to malicious folk
[20:42:24] <mst> The_Blode: this is because it's one of the ways used to identify bots and spammers and refuse to let them on in the first place
[20:42:35] <Altreus> The_Blode: ew, I hope you showered
[20:42:38] <The_Blode> mst yeah on Freenode, I was informed by a robot "I'm scanning your ports...if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear"
[20:42:43] <The_Blode> I kinda agree with that bot
[20:42:50] <mst> right, and libera will do the same thing
[20:42:51] <The_Blode> lol Alt
[20:42:56] <mst> since this basically *is* freenode

[20:43:44] <The_Blode> Well, I've only been using IRC for about 6 months and I love it.
[20:46:06] <Grinnz> it certainly has unique aspects other mediums have not replicated
[20:46:15] <Grinnz> some of them good, some of them not so much :P
[20:46:20] <simcop2387> i'm half curious about how they're doing but i don't want to go back again.  all the drama/popcorn worthy stuff died down a while ago
[20:46:43] <thrig> the last news summary I read about freenode was on 4chan
[20:46:45] <simcop2387> Grinnz: 02,04yea like colors

[20:47:09] <Grinnz> simcop2387: no news articles since the one declaring they're moving their services authentication to blockchain
[20:47:13] <The_Blode> How did you do colors?
[20:47:30] <The_Blode> Some kind of clientside scripting?
[20:47:42] <Altreus> simcop2387: ow
[20:47:46] <Grinnz> The_Blode: certain control characters are commonly interpreted as color codes by irc clients
[20:47:48] <Grinnz> https://modern.ircdocs.horse/formatting.html
[20:47:48] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ IRC Formatting ]
[20:47:51] <simcop2387> The_Blode: depends on the client, but a lot of them have it bound to ctrl+c and then you put in some numbers.  that was ^C02,04
[20:47:58] <mst> The_Blode: there is a documented way to send coloured text over the protocol but it's mostly stripped out by channel configurations anyway
[20:48:14] <thrig> or my client config
[20:48:17] <simcop2387> we used to have it enabled on freenode but nobody bothered to do it here
[20:48:18] <mst> The_Blode: because no, fuck off, don't do that, this is IRC :D
[20:48:46] <Altreus> I can make colours but I can't paste an image? dreadful
[20:48:57] <Altreus> `markdown doesn't even work` !!
[20:48:59] <simcop2387> there's also bold and underline but i don't remember the code for that one
