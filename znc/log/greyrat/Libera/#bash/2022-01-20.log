[01:00:31] <rsjw> sh --version says gnu bash, but the inodes of bash and sh don't match up, so I'm not sure what to make of that
[01:00:41] <Earnestly> rsjw: > The  echo  utility  has not been made obsolescent because of its extremely widespread use in historical applications. Conforming applications that wish to do prompting without <newline> characters or that could possibly be expecting to echo a -n, should use the printf utility derived from the Ninth Edition system.
[01:00:49] <tirnanog> rsjw: that's because apple uses a weird wrapper.
[01:01:06] <emanuele6> no, in zsh, escapes are expanded
[01:01:13] <emanuele6> echo '\n'  prints two newlines
[01:01:18] <emanuele6> (as in pdksh)
[01:01:38] <Earnestly> > It is not possible to use echo portably across all POSIX systems unless both -n (as the first argument) and escape sequences are omitted.
[01:01:57] <greycat> Just use printf.
[01:02:26] <rsjw> I'm aware of the portability arguments for echo, but that's beside the point. I want to understand what is happening
[01:02:42] <emanuele6> rsjw: you are not using bash.
[01:02:49] <emanuele6> you are probably using zsh
[01:02:51] <emanuele6> !zsh
[01:02:51] <greybot> zsh is NOT an enhanced version of bash. It's a different shell, with different features and there's a different channel for your questions: #zsh For zsh-like menu completion, bind '\C-i':menu-complete # there is nothing similar to menu selection

[01:03:06] <tirnanog> I wouldn't jump to that conclusion.
[01:03:11] <Earnestly> The issue is that there is no logic to understand, fundamentally echo will behave in an implementation defined manner
[01:03:34] <rsjw> emanuele6: the inode of the zsh binary doesn't match that of the sh binary, and sh --version reports gnu bash as I said before

[05:46:47] <laureee> hello can someone tell me what the "--" option for kill does?
[05:46:53] <phy1729> !--
[05:46:53] <greybot> The special option -- means "end of options" to every POSIX command except echo and test, and to many other commands. E.g. «mv -- *.png /somedir» (in case one of the filenames begins with "-"). See <http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap12.html#tag_12_02> and <http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/dict/terms/end_of_options>
[05:46:53] <laureee> e.g. "kill -- 345535"
[05:47:03] <laureee> thank you!

[05:48:05] <phy1729> It's a good idea to use it whenever you have a variable or glob that might start with - (or just always so you don't have to think if it's safe or not)

[05:52:16] <laureee> I did read one of the articles, so the effect for the example with kill I gave, would that "the default" signal would be used?
[05:52:42] <e36freak> well, no other was specified there
[05:52:54] <laureee> great
[05:53:02] <e36freak> the concern is that a process name you're passing to kill starts with a '-'
[05:53:12] <e36freak> if that's the case, without --, kill could interpret it as an option and not a name
[05:53:18] *** Quits: digup (~digup@149.167.138.23) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[05:53:21] <e36freak> -bash would be a good example
[05:53:28] <laureee> yes thank you for explaining
[05:54:13] <phy1729> You can also kill via pgid with -pgid so need -- so that's not interpreted as a signal number
[05:56:33] <laureee> it seems "kill -- -1234" and "kill -15 -1234" behave differently. I am not sure why, thought SIGTERM(15) would be default
[06:00:10] *** Joins: }8] (~}8]@107.173.83.81)
[06:02:14] <wiscii> laureee: because kill does not understand the option -1234
[06:06:02] <laureee> wiscii: my current idea is that -1234 is understood because of the "--"
[06:07:17] <laureee> hm do you mean for the -15 one?
[06:07:55] <laureee> so should it be "kill -15 -- -1234" to match behavior of "kill -- -1234"?

[06:11:00] <laureee> I assumed that after -15 the kill command would automatically expect no more options, but bash probably interprets that and therefore doesn't care about the command
[06:11:49] <e36freak> absolutely not, there are a bunch of options you can supply to kill after the signal
[06:11:59] <laureee> fair enough
[06:12:08] <e36freak> kill  [-signal|-s signal|-p]  [-q value] [-a] [--timeout milliseconds signal] [--] pid|name...

[06:21:57] <}8]> thanks phy1729
[06:22:20] <e36freak> }8]: that one won't print default for an empty variable that's set, if you want it to print if it's empty then add a :
[06:22:26] <e36freak> "${foo:-default}"
[06:23:00] <}8]> wouldnt that set foo to "default"?
[06:23:03] <e36freak> no
[06:23:11] <e36freak> = instead of - is the one that does the setting
[06:23:21] <e36freak> !pe
[06:23:21] <greybot> Parameter Expansion expands parameters: "$foo", "$1". You can use it to perform string or array operations: "${file%.mp3}", "${0##*/}", "${files[@]: -4}". They should *always* be quoted. See: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/073 and "Parameter Expansion" in man bash. Also see http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/pe.
[06:23:29] <}8]> ahh that makes sense. thanks!
[06:23:58] <wiscii> plus you need to assign not print

[06:37:07] <Blondie101010> how could you know the pgid?
[06:37:13] <tirnanog> shbot is predictable.

[06:37:52] <tirnanog> we can easily repeat the experiment. let's try the pid this time.

[06:37:57] <shbot> tirnanog: gone
[06:38:17] <tirnanog> so it does, indeed, appear to accept a non-negative pgid as the first non-option operand.
[06:38:30] <tirnanog> er, negative operand, I mean. tired.

[06:38:58] <tirnanog> I mean, better to use -- but things aren't always what they seem.
[06:39:24] <Blondie101010> the problems are probably more common when you don't specify a signal
[06:39:55] <tirnanog> yes, indeed. that would definitely be asking for trouble.
[06:40:16] <tirnanog> at any rate, I can't reproduce the discrepancy reported by laureee for the bash builtin, specifically.

[06:48:24] <laureee> do they require to be "accurately passed" because it's not possible differently?
[06:48:35] <tirnanog> as Blondie101010 pointed out, one would most definitely need it if forgoing the signal specification. for example, kill -1234 would result in an attempt to process -1234 as a signal.
[06:49:08] <tirnanog> anyway, you might not even be using bash.
[06:49:33] <tirnanog> your child process could be /bin/kill for all we know (though it likely behaves similarly).

[13:53:10] <uuidNuni1> my solution is from Soliton :P
[13:53:17] <Soliton> well, how many attempts did you set?
[13:53:20] <quas[m]> if you want to run a check like that and integrate it into a script, you're going to have processes like that hanging around
[13:53:22] <uuidNuni1> the sleep kill wait trick

[13:53:36] <Soliton> so you have to wait for 3 timeouts.

[13:53:48] <quas[m]> (I'm talking about hsv_'s solution)

[13:54:32] <Soliton> you already got a timeout how do you expect it not to work?
[13:54:36] <uuidNuni1> the default bash timeout is too damn long ... i never tested what is the real timeout but it is too long, i can't wait
[13:54:56] <hsv_> It's not a 'bash' timeout.
[13:54:58] <Soliton> yes, that is the issue default tcp timeout is usually fairly long.
[13:55:10] <quas[m]> You're not trying it properly. It's silly to leave the process hanging there. If even it eventually stops after an hour or whatever. it doesn't make any sense whatsoever. You want to check i the connection works, if it doesn't, you stop everything. This is bad practice otherwise.
[13:55:13] <hsv_> It is the OS network stack.
[13:55:34] <quas[m]> just like you'd do with curl or ping.
[13:55:46] <hsv_> Whether it makes sense or not depends on the use case of the original question.
[13:55:51] <quas[m]> It doesn't matter. You need to be smarted than that and adapt.
[13:55:52] <uuidNuni1> ping and curl both have timeout option
[13:55:55] <quas[m]> That's why a kill switch is more commonsensical.
[13:56:09] <Soliton> well, the example ssh command had a 1 hour timeout...
[13:56:10] <hsv_> Maybe, maybe not.
[13:56:53] <quas[m]> well, 1 hour is not reasonable for such a banal check. Really.
[13:57:33] <Soliton> it is what the person that started this discussion used.

[13:57:44] <uuidNuni1> for general case, just install netcat.
[13:59:01] <uuidNuni1> for me, i use the bash tcp trick, because i run my script in bash anyways and i don't want to depend on another tool
[13:59:17] <hsv_> Which ip address is taking 1 hour to time out? and which OS do you use?
[13:59:23] <quas[m]> 1 hour timeout to check a ssh connection is insane. Unless you have a very special purpose - such as discovering if the port is open and connect to it right away - if you have time-based window access. For a simple check where you want to get over the initial common internet issues, hiccups, whatever, it's not really clever.
[13:59:46] <hsv_> quas[m]: Which ip address is taking 1 hour to time out? and which OS do you use?
[14:00:08] <quas[m]> ANY ip you cannot connect to over ssh.
[14:00:32] <hsv_> fix your OS then.
[14:00:41] <uuidNuni1> ssh has  -o ConnectTimeout
[14:00:57] <quas[m]> @hsv_ but i've actually never mentioned an hour, btw
[14:01:01] <quas[m]> someone else did.
[14:01:19] <quas[m]> @hsv_ that's a really clever comeback, by the way :D
[14:01:19] <hsv_> "1 hour timeout to check a ssh connection is insane"
[14:01:27] <Soliton> the 1 hour is from the mentioned ssh-keyscan -T 3600 command.
[14:01:32] <p-i-_> I got it working with nc in the end: `while system(f'nc -vzw 2 {ip} 22 > /dev/null 2>&1') != 0: sleep(1)`
[14:01:38] <quas[m]> yes, because someone (I think Soliton) mentioned it before, that's why I said it.
[14:01:54] <uuidNuni1> net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 60
[14:02:08] <Soliton> p-i-_: why use a shell at all?
[14:02:28] <Soliton> using python to call a shell to call a program...
[14:02:42] <hsv_> That is the way theses days.
[14:02:45] <quas[m]> but 'fix your os' really proves your rhetorical and technical skills, in any case. There's much more to you than meets the eye. Quite clever!
[14:03:21] <hsv_> Python is 'easier' so I'll write my shell scripts in Python and call out to the shell.

[14:04:50] <Soliton> probably no way to connect to a tcp port in python natively.
[14:05:06] <hsv_> That would surprise me greatly.
[14:06:08] <quas[m]> I think you should try rust. You can run python from rust (don't know if you knew that) directly and in the python script you can run the shell commands. And if you can, run this all in wsl2.
[14:06:51] <Soliton> sounds like a good idea. the more layers the more fun it gets.
[14:06:54] <quas[m]> all this in a windows vm inside kvm - that also helps a little bit.
[14:07:06] <uuidNuni1> wow. python does not have native tcp connect module?
[14:07:18] <uuidNuni1> that is ... insane
[14:07:26] <hsv_> But i see it all the time in dev scripts... python calling out to a shell script, calling a makefile, calling python, ...
[14:07:26] <Soliton> clearly. otherwise you wouldn't have to call nc.

[14:25:49] <Soliton> it's the default timeout so yes those implenting the tcp stack or configured the os did it that way because they think it is best for any kind of connection.
[14:27:43] <uuidNuni1> so, let the OS decide? oh no. i decide.
[14:28:14] <Soliton> sure, for your context you might not like the default so you can implement your own.
[14:28:32] <hsv_> so you specify an explicit timeout whenever you ssh ?
[14:28:46] <Soliton> it just seems odd to make it sound like the default is the most ridiculous thing possible. if you think so maybe switch os.
[14:28:54] <hsv_> because if not thenit's just using the os default.
[14:29:30] <uuidNuni1> probe ssh port is not the same as do an ssh connect. the logic is : probe first, if it is open , then connect
[14:30:27] <furrymcgee> how is this different?
[14:31:06] <quas[m]> I completely agree with uuidNuni1 . You need to be smarter than than that. I don't mean to ridicule os defaults, there's obviously a lot of experience put into that. But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't adjust and adapt yourself. Let alone (as already mentioned) the generally known bugs of the OS for which you need to implement tricks and so on. It's an inherent part.

It's bloated among other things. debian/ubuntu-based python images are slimmer, actually. So then it you think it probably doesn't really make sense to install alpine.
[15:05:43] <quas[m]> actually no container linux distribution image has python by default anyway - at least not the important ones.
[15:06:43] <quas[m]> debian, ubuntu, (centos/rhel/alma), alpine - that covers the majority.

[18:04:12] <gnoo> then scroll down(with arrow keys) till you see '-g' and '-n'
[18:04:18] <cousteau> Thanks!  Will have a look :)

[18:08:23] <gnoo> yeah, just use info --vi-keys if you don't know emacs keys
[18:08:39] <Earnestly> I do, info is still crap.  Only emacs is decent-ish

[18:09:54] <gnoo> i actually like the narrow text, makes reading much more easier with two tiled windows

[18:11:14] <Earnestly> Sure you can
[18:11:36] <Earnestly> I'm not suggesting emacs is bad for this, or that you liking info is bad.  I'm saying I don't like it and why
[18:11:43] <Earnestly> Can understand why people like info
[18:12:15] <gnoo> i don't really want to manually search 'A long String With Mixed Case' because i'd need to type that manually and with my shit typing will get it wrong 3 times
[18:12:22] <Earnestly> For me, ugly, verbose, bloated, meandering.  Not as bad as latex documentation though
[18:12:36] <cousteau> I'm gonna test those options as well because info is getting on my nerves
[18:12:50] <Dan39> you can search case insensitive you know...
[18:12:57] <Earnestly> latex documentation is just as verbose but author also takes opportunity to show off their latex skills

[18:14:17] <gnoo> Dan39: in some manpages you need to search for titles but that's a common phrase so it's a bunch of 'n'
[18:14:58] <Dan39> i mean, i've gotten good at knowing to just search for ^title then
[18:15:16] <Dan39> or some other trick, like putting a bunch of spaces before it

[18:16:23] <fuzzybear3965> Does anyone know a tee incantation that I might use?
[18:16:46] <Dan39> fuzzybear3965: tee to grep?
[18:16:51] <cousteau> OK so -g and -n are strictly for numeric sorts, and the lines have to START with a number.  They don't support letters with numbers in them.

[18:16:54] <Earnestly> fuzzybear3965: cmd | tee file

[18:17:07] <emanuele6> you don't need to do crazy tee redirection to pipe
[18:17:18] <Earnestly> cousteau: -g understands e notation

[22:36:37] <Soliton> !basename
[22:36:37] <greybot> basename(1) can strip the directory and extension from a path (dir/subdir/file.ext -> file.ext or file). A parameter expansion can do it cleaner and *much* faster: "${path##*/}", "${path%.*}", at the cost of missing edge cases like path=/ or path=/path/to/dir/
[22:36:48] <Soliton> using sed for this is silly.
