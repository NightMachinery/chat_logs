[03:19:56] <d_bot_> <raedr7n> Hey, sorry if this has been asked to death, but I can't find much online that's recent. I'm llooking at selecting a new alternative stdlib for my next few ocaml projects, and I'm stuck between containers and betteries included. Could someone give me the lowdown on the basic differences? I know they both take a similar approach, by extending the standard library, but I'm trying to avoid reading their entire source codes if I can

[04:43:12] <d_bot_> <mbacarella> I assume you're aware of jane's base/core libraries? Also intended to be stdlib replacements.
[04:43:39] <d_bot_> <raedr7n> Yes, I'm aware of those as well.
[04:45:26] <d_bot_> <nsmmrs> Have you seen OCamlverse? https://ocamlverse.github.io/content/standard_libraries.html
[04:45:56] <d_bot_> <nsmmrs> It has a lot of nice breakdowns of "popular libraries for x".
[04:47:48] <d_bot_> <nsmmrs> In my personal experience, I've always been aware of Batteries, but I only see people actively discuss Containers and Base/Core. The Containers developer is also very active in this discord, which is cool.
[04:47:51] <d_bot_> <raedr7n> Yes; I've read that. I'm not sure what "modern" means in this context though. I guess I'm looking for something a bit more specific. For instance, the batteries decription states "that Containers was created to follow a different design than Batteries". How so?
[04:48:13] <d_bot_> <raedr7n> That is cool!
[04:48:29] <d_bot_> <nsmmrs> You can ask in the #containers-lib channel. ðŸ™‚
[04:48:43] <d_bot_> <raedr7n> ah okay, thanks
[04:49:17] <d_bot_> <nsmmrs> (I mean you can ask anywhere, but that's probably the best place) XD
[04:49:27] <d_bot_> <mbacarella> Ah. How come the Jane ones didn't make your shortlist?
[05:39:45] <d_bot_> <raedr7n> I'm lead to believe that they're significantly incompatible with Stdlib, and I already have a somewhat substantial codebase using Stdlib that I'd like to migrate in the future. That, and that I understand the Janestreet style of and approach to writing OCaml to be somewhat specialized.

[17:40:35] <d_bot_> <VPhantom> Here's an odd one: I sometimes end up with constructs like: `if cond then (...things...; true) else false` and it feels "dirty" like I'm missing something cleaner. There's no `Bool.bind` but it's almost a case for it.  That `else false` is bugging me with how redundant it looks. ðŸ˜› Am I in fact missing something or is this typical?
[17:44:42] <vsiles> if cond then (....); cond ?
[17:45:43] <d_bot_> <VPhantom> The condition is non-trivial.
[17:46:12] <d_bot_> <VPhantom> I suppose I could do `let c = cond in if c then (...); c` ðŸ¤”
[17:46:50] <d_bot_> <VPhantom> It's one less allocation but not particularly cleaner to the eye I think. Hm.

[17:48:51] <d_bot_> <VPhantom> Yeah I considered that, or making a let binding which would essentially be a `Bool.bind`, but it didn't really turn out to be that "clean" in the end. ðŸ˜•

[17:51:06] <d_bot_> <VPhantom> (i.e. I haven't experimented with whether `a || b || c` behaved like how I used it for shortcuts in Perl.)
[17:52:00] <d_bot_> <octachron> `&&` is short-circuiting (more precisely the compiler primitive used by `&&` is)
[17:52:01] <d_bot_> <VPhantom> On the plus side, the PPX or let binding doesn't allocate the result, it just passes it along. Minus side, it adds a function call.
[17:52:22] <d_bot_> <VPhantom> I might start using `&&` on occasion then, looks like a good fit. ðŸ¤”
[17:53:37] <d_bot_> <VPhantom> Alright then. Glad I wasn't missing something obvious. I rarely reach that kind of situation but it happened a few times this week so I thought I should investigate.

[22:01:53] <d_bot_> <VPhantom> (What I'm _actually_ doing in there probably looks like rookie code though. ðŸ˜¬ )
[22:08:26] <d_bot_> <NULL> `e1 && e2` expands to `if e1 then e2 else false` in pretty much all programming languages
[22:09:22] <d_bot_> <NULL> Imperative ones use it extensively to have `in_bounds i && condition a.(i)`
[22:09:55] <d_bot_> <NULL> This way you don't have an out of bounds exception (or segfault) if i is not good

[22:11:22] <d_bot_> <VPhantom> On a single line, I like it. Reminds me of ternary operators in other languages. This one looks awkward. I'm updating my paste to show both.
[22:11:53] <d_bot_> <VPhantom> I'll grant you that with my `ocamlformat` settings it's 9 lines instead of 11.
[22:13:27] <d_bot_> <VPhantom> I do like how it avoids indentation. I might end up with `&&` on second thoughtâ€¦ Thanks the nudge!
[22:19:03] <d_bot_> <glennsl> It's good practice to give names to complex conditions anyway, I think, even when only used once.
[22:20:35] <d_bot_> <VPhantom> Hm. Fair counterpoint.
[22:21:28] <d_bot_> <undu> It's Aldo helpful to name t'hem if they're expensive to calculate
[22:22:01] <d_bot_> <undu> Ugh, the autocorrect
[22:22:03] <d_bot_> <VPhantom> Yeah I tend to do that, especially if there's a chance it might be needed more than once in the future.
