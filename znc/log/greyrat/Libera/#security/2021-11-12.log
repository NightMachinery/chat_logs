[02:40:12] <gartt> It's awesome that someone can fit an entire library on one tiny hard drive - something that would otherwise require many large rooms and huge amounts of time and maintenance
[02:41:09] <Joanna> Digital books seem good at first from a storage and portability perspective but several major flaws have been discovered such as requiring I working device and reliable power grid and you can’t share them with all your friends like a real book without violating some copyrights and they can be remotely removed from your device or altered without your consent.

[03:44:28] <Joanna> I recently went to wilderness and there were toilets that were open underneath with a large drop and the poop washes down the hill. Or maybe gets eaten by wild pigs. That’s a sustainable design in my opinion but wouldn’t be too good for cities
[03:44:51] <mats1> mmm wild pig

[03:45:40] <gartt> Yeah, but outhouses are sustainable. Population density in cities is the problem
[03:46:20] <Joanna> The best use for poop is agriculture. Outhouses are horrible and full of flies in my experience and god help you if you drop something down there
[03:46:35] <gartt> Don't drop anything down there :)
[03:46:50] <Joanna> Accidents happen
[03:47:24] <Joanna> Outhouses have to keep digging new holes.

[03:47:44] <Joanna> Of course it is.
[03:48:00] <CitraBenzoet> compost toilets work fairly well, you just have to manage them. and based on gen. publics ability to properly and effectivly use a modern bathroom... they would never work
[03:48:06] <mats1> i mean, you can, and many people do, but its not desirable
[03:48:07] <gartt> Joanna: Yes outhouses have to be rotated, but it's not a big deal unless you're providing services for a very high population density, but that's the problem with population density, not outhouses

[03:48:17] <CitraBenzoet> im a big fan of a drop toilet or compost toilet when camping

[04:24:58] <`St0ner> butter lard and suet have next to zero nutrition, and tons of calories per any unit of measurement/dosing. you'd have to be an olympic-level athlete to healthily use that many calories
[04:25:03] <ajak> humans are communal animals, much to the chagrin of you individualists
[04:25:12] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[04:25:29] <gartt> mats1: I'd say village to town level is the perfect population density for useful land vs number of people, and exchange of goods and functioning as a group
[04:25:42] <Joanna> `St0ner: you should read the book by Weston price . Nutrition and physical degeneration
[04:25:52] <gartt> You have the best of boths worlds concerning city and rural that way
[04:26:39] <Joanna> gartt: the only problem with rural is you might be attacked by desperate people from cities
[04:26:40] <`St0ner> i dont read books like that, as most have their own financial self-interests in writing and promoting the books. i read peer-reviewed academic papers and studies on this topic
[04:27:02] <gartt> My wife's family lives in a village with a perfect population density. There's plenty of land for farming so that the place is large self-sufficient, yet you have enough people within a walking distance of 15 minutes from the center, so you can function as a group
[04:27:32] <gartt> Joanna: That's why village-level communities are best-off
[04:27:34] <Joanna> gartt: that sounds like an ideal situation
[04:27:48] <mats1> rural areas tend to be heavily economically subsidised
[04:28:01] <Joanna> It sure is hard to find places like that anymore though
[04:28:03] <gartt> Joanna: Where my wife's family lives, if there was civil war or some major catastrophe, people would still have food
[04:28:24] <`St0ner> also when someone tells you a single book changed their worldview or significantly gave them some sort of knowledge.. this is a major red flag
[04:28:36] <Joanna> I think an isolated rural village far from a large city
[04:28:49] <ajak> single books can be full of valuable stuff
[04:28:54] <ajak> the kama sutra, for example
[04:28:56] <mats1> towns don't have the human capital to keep infrastructure going without cities

[04:29:47] <gartt> mats1: But they can build microgrids
[04:29:51] <ajak> gartt: so not "on their own"
[04:29:59] <mats1> they can hardly staff a nat gas plant
[04:30:09] <gartt> ajak: Depends on what you mean by infrastructure
[04:30:12] <mats1> the rural brain drain has been incredible for twenty years
[04:31:10] <`St0ner> mats1: engineering is a different area. obviously you need to read engineering textbooks to get to the level of building a power plant. i can also speak on this, as a licensed professional engineer
[04:31:13] <gartt> mats1: There's merit to that, but also lots of very smart people with very high-paying engineering jobs who are family-oriented and live in towns

[04:31:57] <`St0ner> on food/nutrition, tons of misinformation out there. on power plants, the books have pretty solid information
[04:32:18] <mats1> in an apocalypse scenario, i think more fall of ussr than mad max
[04:32:48] <Joanna> Small towns can have wind and water wheels in fact water wheels used to power entire factories for making textiles and such
[04:32:48] <mats1> so people in towns are sort of in that middle ground where they have dudes with guns but not tanks or missiles
[04:34:35] <gartt> mats1: Nobody knows how that would work out. I have a national guard base about 30 seconds away from me

[04:35:44] <mats1> its a nice thought exercise
[04:36:09] <mats1> stuff like covid reminds you that supply chains are fragile and could be more fragile if a bigger wind blew it over
[04:36:46] <Joanna> If you have a small town you still need to have a contingency plan in case people show up to steal all your food etc
[04:37:41] <mats1> it only takes two days of disrupted food logistics for things to get hairy
[04:38:09] <Joanna> mats1: it’s very easy to have food supply interrupted. I’ve had my supply of uncooked milk stopped for months before.
[04:38:21] <mats1> uncooked?
[04:38:23] <gartt> Basically at the town level, that'd be large percentages of firearms ownership and training which would make stealing resources too expensive
[04:38:30] <Joanna> Unpasteurized.
[04:38:49] <ajak> lol, why am i not surprised
[04:38:54] <gartt> mats1: Yes. After just a few missed meals, desperation kicks in fast
[04:39:04] <mats1> i've heard interesting things about raw milk but not tried
[04:39:07] <Joanna> gartt: firearms or other means of defense
[04:39:19] <Joanna> mats1: the flavor is so much better
[04:39:28] <Joanna> And the vitamins aren’t destroyed

[04:39:45] <mats1> i'm neutral on the subject of dairy
[04:40:01] <gartt> I've had raw milk from the cow abroad. Horse milk too, which was horrible
[04:40:41] <gartt> Chickens are a huge one. Eggs are full of all sorts of nutrients, and chickens are easy to maintain

[04:42:18] <ajak> the fact that you're using online gaming as evidence of how humanity will behave in apocalypse is comically telling

[04:44:06] <Joanna> I can tell you what will happen. People will be uncoordinated and cowardly or reckless
[04:44:21] <Joanna> Majority are cowardly
[04:44:24] <gartt> On one hand, the element of surprise is a big advantage to attackers. However, it takes many more resources to attack a fortified area than it does to defend. So who knows

[04:46:40] <Joanna> One thing I’ve often found about people in groups in combat situations they are rather self centered and only care about themselves.
[04:47:01] <`St0ner> how often are you in combat situations?
[04:47:49] <Joanna> Without proper training no chance of winning unless they have superior numbers and even then it’s not guaranteed
[04:48:38] <`St0ner> a good framework to understanding cultural differences with respect to individualism vs collectivism, is hofstede's cultural dimensions. i strong suspect more individualistic societies exhibit the behaviour you describe in group combat

If the site is HTTPS only, the only way a session ID can be stolen is if the client computer is hacked, in which case the username and password most likely will be stolen, or if the server is hacked, in which case a much bigger problem exists. The idea that someone is trying to guess a session ID doesn't seem a valid reason to limit the time on the ID. Am

[22:52:40] <viktech> lol, it's called IRC etiquette.  Back when you were a little boy, it was well-established to do
[22:52:48] <elkclone> yeah let's remember we're homies. there are great concepts at play. and I like both sides. with some judicial use of the kings powers. :D

[22:53:09] <viktech> You can either talk to others in a channel publicly or /msg them privately. However the latter is considered rude. Don't occupy a single person for your purpose. Others may as well be interested in a solution to your problem, too.

[22:53:47] <viktech> you seem to be deeply, personally offended by this

[22:54:35] <elkclone> ty, both of you for illuminating the dual nature of pm' ing . :D
[22:55:03] <Hash> IRC provides solutions like /ignore and on libera.chat usermodes +R (registred users only) or +g (caller id feature)
[22:55:05] <elkclone> it's like a double edged sword.
[22:55:15] <elkclone> indeed.
[22:55:38] <viktech> yes, and you know how many pm's ive received unsolicited on libera?
[22:55:44] <viktech> one, yours
[22:55:49] <Hash> Of course, anyone is free to say, hey, I require that people respect my wishes and only ask me in public before they can PM me.
[22:55:50] <viktech> so i see no need to set modes
[22:55:52] <Hash> Which is 100% ok.
[22:56:08] <Hash> And other people can make the decision that hey, it's violates privacy, so I don't want to message that guy.
[22:56:19] <Hash> It's just, you don't have to choose the abusive path :)
[22:56:38] <viktech> let me put some context into perspective
[22:56:49] <elkclone> yeah if I am a regular and get to know a few ppl I ussually make it known I prefer to be asked in open chat so that there is meta data that we collaborated in some way.
[22:56:49] <viktech> context is important, such as the network
[22:57:00] <Hydragyrum> well considering you've been registered on libera for just over a week, not surprising
