[05:52:00] <laurus> isekaijin: Well actually I'm interested in doing problems from the various textbooks, it seems like a lot of them require some kind of clever manipulation that you're somehow supposed to know beforehand
[05:52:32] <laurus> So when I was self-studying undergrad analysis, I used a book that basically taught you all those techniques, so I could solve most of the problems without asking for help on any of them
[05:52:54] <isekaijin> Mmm... I do not think there are many books for a graduate student audience focusing specifically on such manipulations and tricks.
[05:53:01] <laurus> But I've started to think that book was a total anomaly because when I look at graduate analysis books it seems like you're supposed to know techniques that were never explicitly shown in the textbook

[05:57:32] <laurus> Guest59: I also disagree with you overall. For example I was trying to find out how to do something related to metric spaces and found this book from India that was also a completely self-contained resource on that topic, it was amazing.
[05:57:40] <isekaijin> laurus: Graduate books are less self-contained, because they assume that you know undergraduate material, even if that material was not easy when you were an undergraduate.
[05:58:11] <laurus> isekaijin: OK so maybe I'm missing some of what was supposed to be "undergrad material" then. I should look for some other undergrad analysis books maybe that are harder
[05:58:17] <laurus> Or that cover more techniques or something.

[06:50:30] <W> well my mind is blown; you need to know n different points of a polynomial of degree n - 1 or lower to uniquely identify the polynomial, but it doesn't matter /which/ n points (or whether they're specified as real or complex numbers), so whatever points you have you can convert to the points of the n'th roots of unity
[06:50:33] <W> or, if you increase n (which is fine since the polynomial is just then overspecified) to the nearest power of two, you can have 2^k'th roots of unity, and can do an inverse discrete fast Fourier transform on the values to get the coefficients (in nlogn time) or vice versa
[06:51:15] <W> *nearest higher
[06:51:21] <qergle> other way around. no?
[06:52:49] <W> well I said "or vice versa" so I'm wrong either way; but you get from coefficient form to point form with a discrete Fourier transform and from point form to coefficient form with an inverse discrete Fourier transform

[07:36:46] <Z-module> well yeah, not needed much, I guess.
[07:37:57] <rex_victor> ah ok
[07:40:02] <isekaijin> For example, let F = K(x^p) and E = K(x), where K has characteristic p, and x is transcendental over K. Then any automorphism of E/F is determined by the image of x. But clearly x is the only p-th root of x^p, so Aut(E/F) is trivial, even though E/F is normal and not trivial.
[07:40:46] <isekaijin> Characteristic p can be annoying like that.

[08:08:05] <droid3> What happens if instead of ODE and PDE we have equation that are not equality but <= >= or < , >
[08:08:47] <droid3> usually we just teach students on = when talking PDE and ODE but even i myself are a bit confused when it comes to  < , > , <= , >=  cases
[08:09:24] <droid3> for example solve y' <= 3x say
[08:10:06] <droid3> if we use a slack variable we can write it as y' + s = 3x
[08:10:35] <droid3> but i am confused as it still doesnt make to much sense to ask about inequality based ODE and PDE
[08:10:55] <Samian> well, greater than or less than would be representing volumes instead of exact points
[08:10:55] <droid3> Samian you still there and interested in talking about this
[08:11:17] <droid3> right regions or sections of a function
[08:11:27] <Samian> droid3  think about it. Consider y = 3 versus y > 3.  Y greater than 3 is a region. Y = 3 is a line.
[08:11:30] <droid3> but i am confused on how to go about solving an equation like that
[08:11:53] <Samian> what are you trying to solve?
[08:12:11] <Samian> all possible values that satisfy the equation?
[08:12:40] <droid3> for example y' = 3   means y = 3x + c is the general solution but with <=  and the arbitrary c its throwing me off/confusing me.
[08:13:18] <droid3> is it even true that we can integrate both sides and still have <=  hold???
[08:13:56] <droid3> Or would you first have to convert it thru some kind of slack variable that probably depends on x as well to an equality and then solve the ODE as normal.
[08:13:58] <droid3> ????
[08:15:31] <droid3> What i am thinking Samian is that y' <= 3 means use a slack function s(x)
[08:15:58] <droid3> and rewrite y' + s(x) = 3
[08:16:28] <droid3> that way it becomes an ODE to solve again
[08:17:05] <droid3> would i be wrong in think this way???
[08:17:36] <droid3> Because its similar how you turn <= >=  when your working with linear programming with slack variables and such.
[08:18:05] <droid3> I figured the same could be applied to solve inequality based differential equations if that such a thing.

[08:30:44] <droid3> Samian you want like the limit definition of the derivative or something else ....??? we all know what derivatives and integrals/antiderivatives are

[08:31:34] <dfads> or higher level algebra
[08:31:48] <dfads> you have abstractions like limits but otherwise is just algebra
[08:32:39] <droid3> well ok but limits when applied to inequality is the issue then
[08:32:49] <PlanckWalk> Suppsoe y = 100, and f(x) = 0 for all x.
[08:33:12] <droid3> because other then that like you said the ODE can be rewritten into just pure algebraic/function equations
[08:33:40] <PlanckWalk> Oh, strictly less than.
[08:33:52] <PlanckWalk> Then let f(x) = x/1000
[08:34:06] <PlanckWalk> Err f(x) = 1/1000 for all x
[08:34:18] <droid3> how about the orginal example i was talking on
[08:34:19] <PlanckWalk> Then y' = 0 < f(x) for all x
[08:34:26] <droid3> y' < 3
[08:34:32] <Samian> What things are able to be differentiated? If you think about it, only *borders* can be differentiated. In 2d space, the line acts as the border between two regions.  in 3d space, a surface acts as a border separating spaces.  Because the surface is really a border, we can differentiate it to find the plane that is normal to a particular point of the surface..  What is *not* differentiatiable is free space. It's linguistic trickery and misuse of language to say,
[08:34:32] <Samian>  for example, "find the directive of the interior of a square." I find your confusion is from not detecting legitimate uses of language and words from the misuses that don't make sense.
[08:35:13] <PlanckWalk> Functions, not borders
[08:35:14] <droid3> i can write that as y(x)-y(x0) < 3 (x-x0) as x -> x0
[08:36:31] <Samian> PlanckWalk  functions are borders.  functions are basically hyperplanes.
[08:36:32] <dfads> symbolic logic ( < , <=, >, >=, epsilon, delta, or, and, =>, etc) + algebra = calculus
[08:36:43] <PlanckWalk> Samian: No, they really aren't.

[08:38:32] <Samian> dfads  in order words, derivates can less information than the function it was a derivative of.
[08:38:40] * PlanckWalk decides to come back when there's less nonsense in channel.

[08:39:00] <droid3> because there slopes in certain regions would be less then < 3 for example
[08:39:23] <Samian> PlanckWalk  sorry, am I the one who is stating what you consider nonsense?
[08:39:33] <Samian> I'll be quiet and let you talk :)
[08:39:36] <droid3> so its a bit confusing maybe the problem is not well posed and would need an initial condition or boundary condition to make it more practical or useful ... not sure
[08:39:51] <Samian> PlanckWalk  please continue. I'm interested in your thoughts
[08:40:21] <droid3> but was thinking on inequality based equations for ODE and PDE. Books and what i have study thru the years never talk to much about inequality based differential/integral equations.
[08:40:38] <dfads> Samian: yes. in reality theres many possible 'derivative' functions you could define as long as they map f -> f' in well defined way, where you could 'restore' f from f' +/- a constant. if you *allowed* more flexibility, you could define more abstract "derivatives" or "shadow functions" and invent a new "calculus"
[08:40:48] <dfads> an information calculus

[08:41:41] <droid3> So the last missing piece for me was equations and systems of equation for ODE and PDE that involved inequalities
[08:42:13] <droid3> so i figured i ask but i am really confused on how to approach solving a general solution to even the most basic ones like y' < 3
[08:42:22] <dfads> most basic example is in geometry. a Platonic solid + light source produces an actual shadow which is one such derivative function. in that sense the light source is just a functor.
[08:42:30] <dfads> light is a functor

[08:46:15] <droid3> heck take x^2+1 that function derivative is 2x and 2x < 3 if x < 3/2
[08:46:45] <droid3> so on that interval even x^2+1 would be a possible canidate solution to y' < 3

[08:46:59] <droid3> so maybe using slack functions like s(x)
[08:47:27] <droid3> and the most general solution is just  int s(x) + 3x

[08:48:15] <Samian> When thinking about problems I try alternating between thinking about them in language and without language. When doing that sometimes I see there isn't really a problem and it's language and wording things a certain way that is creating an illusion of a real problem

[12:48:29] <savask> You combine things together in a cup, so kinda logical
[12:48:55] <savask> I never had trouble remembering what is what, but we had this explanation at school and for some reason it stuck
[12:48:55] <ski> well, if you pour coffee and milk/cream in a cup, the liquids meet, no ?
[12:48:56] <int-e> yeah, cup and cap make actual sense

[12:49:26] <int-e> Meet and join are too close in meaning for me, though I usually guess their roles correctly.
[12:49:30] <ski> "cup" and "cap" makes visual sense, yes

[16:09:28] <riv> savask: what's an algebraic group?
[16:09:52] <isekaijin> “Algebraic group” is to “varieties” as “Lie group” is to “smooth manifolds”.
[16:09:58] <riv> HisShadow: so what is interesting about that? to put it bluntly
[16:10:01] <savask> riv: Eh, the general definition is kinda hard, but think matrix groups
[16:10:13] <HisShadow> riv: or specifically checking if some insane system of equations in some field even has any solutions
[16:10:14] <riv> i have actually not studied lie groups
[16:10:20] <isekaijin> Oh, dang.
[16:10:39] <savask> riv: Most finite simple groups come from algebraic groups in some way, so you can kinda study finite objects using tools from algebraic geometry
[16:10:43] <riv> HisShadow: so fermats last theorem
[16:10:51] <isekaijin> Then an algebraic group is a variety and a group, such that the group operations are actually morphisms of varieties.
[16:10:56] <riv> this is the main "application" of alg geom I know, but it's very anti-motivating
[16:10:59] <HisShadow> riv: Z is not a field
[16:11:33] <isekaijin> For me the main motivation for algebraic geometry is that you can do combinatorial / enumerative stuff with it.

[22:53:56] <Z-module> Decker, if a nonzero complex number z has length r and angle theta, then in cartesian coordiantes  z = (r cos(theta)) + i (r sin(theta)).  So do that for both A and B, add those normally, and now convert back to polar, but here you will need the atan2() function.  The widely-taught formula  arctan(Im(z)/Re(z))  is wholly inadequate. I wish they'd stop teaching it.
[22:53:57] <Decker> well I guess there's some other constraints on that, which define the word smooth better... there should be a scalar +Bt(Br,Bth) ... but reall the A point is moving, so the direction ends up changin...
[22:54:32] <Decker> okay - but doing that I lose the original theta - it goes out of bounds from the r-theta space
