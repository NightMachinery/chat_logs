[01:24:43] <LeonardSmith[m]> This might be a stupid/vague question, but I upgraded my vim to neovim, using all the latest and greatest to make it a superior TypeScript replacement for vscode. Something is happening now to duplicate my entire buffer and it's driving me mad. I don't even notice usually, because I'm at the same spot in my code, only there's an entire new copy of the buffer above it. Any clue on how I can track this down without just disabling plugins

[11:39:41] <daniel_ntk[m]> hi so far I'm using nvim-qt to connect to a headless neovim instance in docker containers using --server mode. This works well so far. Due to the talks just now about other gui frontends I wanted to try the same in Goneovim but I think an error in startup that needs to be "confirmed" by pressing enter stops it from launching. When I first attach nvim-qt to the headless instance (which works fine) and then connect the Goneovim client, I am
[11:39:41] <daniel_ntk[m]> seeing "Error detected while processing UIEnter Autocommands for "*": E475: Invalid Argument: Channel doesn't exist". Can anyone help me what that might refer to? I guess this might be some code that Goneovim runs on startup?

[11:40:18] <daniel_ntk[m]> once I confirm this in nvim-qt, Goneovim connects

[13:19:01] <daniel_ntk[m]> Also, now I tried it by launching nvim in the powershell instead of WSL, same behavior. I just opened an issue on the Goneovim repository, maybe they have an idea. It seems as if Goneovim also executes some vim stuff and adds some commands so maybe there is a problem with some of it there. Anyways, thank you for your help!

[13:23:12] <kylo252[m]> neovide doesn't seem to work with that same command, at least nothing is happening, my final suggestion is that maybe try to run neovim directly inside the container, or maybe check if this can work for your use-case: https://github.com/chipsenkbeil/distant.nvim 
[13:30:15] <daniel_ntk[m]> I'll try neovide as it seems to also have a remote-connection functionality. My workflow is actually that I have built something similar to the vscode dev containers where I have a custom launcher I made in python independent from nvim that builds a generalized dev image where I configured all tools that I need for the various projects as well as a nvim instance (and other stuff) that I'm working on as well as project configurations with
[13:30:16] <daniel_ntk[m]> (possibly) docker-compose overrides to customize the containers if necessary (additional services etc.). Launching a project will mount the project folder inside the container and launch a headless instance connected to a random free port outside. The launcher then starts nvim-qt and connects to this instance. So neovim usually is inside the container. This works so far without problems I just wanted to try out other frontends as ligatures
[13:30:16] <daniel_ntk[m]> aren't working yet and I like eye candy 🙂

[13:45:16] <kylo252[m]> sounds nice, as long as you're exposing your docker-daemon over tcp as well. As for ligatures, I'm not sure which ones exactly you're looking for, but having a gui or not never affected that ability for me using dev-icons or powerline symbols in my terminal
[13:45:18] <kylo252[m]> as long as you're not*

[16:09:16] <ii14[m]> that's the downside of vim's highlighting, if you want something more accurate then there is treesitter
[16:09:21] *** Joins: LordRishav (~LordRisha@user/lordrishav)
[16:09:34] <arch-angel> i've seen treesitter, but I am scared that it might mess up my YCM config
[16:09:54] <ii14[m]> it shouldn't
[16:10:05] <ii14[m]> I don't know how good is the c++ parser though
[16:10:34] <clason[m]> I feel compelled to add that nvim-treesitter is still experimental
[16:10:47] <clason[m]> so I'd not recommend it if you don't want to follow up on breaking changes and some rough edges
[16:11:29] <clason[m]> the cpp parser is much better than the very bare-bones builtin syntax file (which some people prefer though)
[16:11:58] <ii14[m]> there is one more option, and that is using clangd and a plugin that does syntax highlighting using language server
[16:11:59] <clason[m]> more relevant, there's also a `glsl` parser
[16:12:31] <arch-angel> nah, I'm just looking for something that can highlight my custom defined classes
[16:12:49] <arch-angel> like ones i declared in my own headers or ones like from Vulkan and OpenGL
[16:13:47] <ii14[m]> https://github.com/robert-oleynik/clangd-nvim works with clangd and https://github.com/jackguo380/vim-lsp-cxx-highlight with ccls
[16:14:39] <ii14[m]> but if you want to do that, you'd probably want to switch from ycm to nvim-lsp
[16:14:48] <arch-angel> ohhhh nope
[16:15:18] <puremouron> my fork of YCM has support for semantic highlighting fwiw
[16:15:31] <ii14[m]> oh cool
[16:16:00] <arch-angel> but I'm using tabnine's fork of YCM
[16:16:09] <puremouron> though, i don't recommend using my fork directly as i force push it all the time
[16:16:16] <puremouron> oh tabnine, then i'm out
[16:16:29] <puremouron> that thing is in no way associated with YCM
[16:17:16] <ii14[m]> gabmus: for a standalone tool you could use libclang
[16:17:22] <ii14[m]> there are for example python bindings
[16:17:34] <ii14[m]> I don't know if something like that already exists
[16:18:34] <bfredl> when reading "generating implementation" I nowadays always assume some GPT-3 shenanigans :P
[16:18:41] <puremouron> gabmus:  you mean like generate method implementation stubs?
[16:19:16] <puremouron> i'm not aware of a tool for that
[16:19:23] <puremouron> though i suppose it might exists
[16:19:24] <puremouron> s/exists/exist/
[16:19:36] <puremouron> i usually just use ycm to auto complete the declarations
[16:19:37] <ii14[m]> it's 100% doable even inside just nvim, I'm just not aware of anything that does it right now
[16:20:17] <bfredl> It's doable, someone just needs to do the work :)
[16:20:21] <ii14[m]> yup
[16:21:31] <ii14[m]> though clangd recently got a code action where you can move the function definition between header and source, maybe that can somewhat do what you want
[16:21:43] <ii14[m]> I don't know if it generates the new file for you

[16:26:09] <bfredl> it might not generate a nice well-organized .cxx file, but at least taking one method prototype and generating one implementation stub sounds like a low-hanging fruit for a code action
[16:27:39] <sunjonSenghanBri> I thought I'd seen it somewhere; either a treesitter thing or an LSP code-action. Pretty sure it was the latter now you mentioned it
[16:29:35] <arch-angel> so if I install treesitter to somehow make my syntax look nicer, will it conflict with my YCM?
[16:30:07] <puremouron> i don't think so
[16:30:15] <puremouron> i have no reason to believe it would have any effect on YCM
[16:30:32] <puremouron> it does interfere with vimspector though due to to it always setting the filetype or something (rather than the syntax)
[16:30:36] <clason[m]> unless it uses syntax regions for conditional completion
[16:30:52] <puremouron> ycm does not use syntax regions for conditioanl completion
[16:31:05] <arch-angel> right i don't think i have vimspector
[16:31:06] <clason[m]> puremouron: yeah, we're trying to get rid of that. filetype detection is Neovim's job
[16:31:09] <puremouron> it does (can) parse the syntax keywords to generate completion keywords, but that can be disabled
[16:31:37] <clason[m]> that (optional) feature wouldn't work, then
[16:32:13] <puremouron> they still exist though no? (the syn keyword stuff ?)
[16:32:31] <clason[m]> no, I don't think so
[16:32:43] <puremouron> so vim doesn't even parse the "usual" syntax file if treesitter is used?

[16:33:30] <clason[m]> (which is not the whole point of tree-sitter, of course)
[16:34:07] <arch-angel> I'm tempted by the treesitter-folding
[16:34:23] <arch-angel> as the folding provided by neovim somehow breaks auto-session
[16:34:52] <clason[m]> it's still the same Neovim folding, though

[17:42:54] <sunjonSenghanBri> I have a better idea, but not the time to do it
[17:43:08] <clason[m]> arch-angel: just try it?
[17:43:14] *** Joins: fjmorazan (~quassel@user/fjmorazan)
[17:43:21] <arch-angel> try what?
[17:43:44] <bfredl> the nvim-treesitter?
[17:43:59] <arch-angel> ok
[17:44:03] <arch-angel> i am trying it now
[17:44:18] <sunjonSenghanBri> keep us updated.
[17:44:26] <arch-angel> alright
[17:45:12] <arch-angel> huh, it's stuck at post-update hook for nvim-treesitter...
[17:45:44] <arch-angel> that's interesting
[17:45:45] <sunjonSenghanBri> is that the error message? "stuck at post-update" ?
[17:46:09] <sunjonSenghanBri> the thing?
[17:46:11] <ii14[m]> it can take some time i think
[17:46:15] <arch-angel> no, it just hanged at "Post-update hook for nvim-treesitter"
[17:46:24] <arch-angel> no response
[17:46:25] <arch-angel> nothing
[17:46:31] <ii14[m]> because it's compiling parsers
[17:46:32] <arch-angel> i'll give it 10 minutes
[17:46:44] <clason[m]> especially if you insist on installing everything
[17:46:52] <clason[m]> (I would strongly suggest only installing the parsers you need, manually -- in this case only `cpp`)
[17:47:08] <arch-angel> I only added this line -> Plug 'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter', {'do': ':TSUpdate'}
[17:47:14] <arch-angel> and did :PlugInstall
[17:47:16] <arch-angel> nothing else
[17:47:31] <arch-angel> i don't know what parsers it's compiling
[17:48:01] <clason[m]> That should not install anything (besides the plugin)
[17:48:11] <clason[m]> you can probably safely cancel and restart neovim
[17:48:18] <arch-angel> right, it actually has installed finished and I'm wondering why it hasn't finished
[17:48:23] <arch-angel> how smart
[17:48:40] <clason[m]> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[17:48:52] <arch-angel> alright just ran :TSInstall cpp
[17:49:06] <arch-angel> yey it's a success
[17:49:09] <arch-angel> what next
[17:50:16] <sunjonSenghanBri> next, the world!
[17:50:44] <sunjonSenghanBri> does the highlighting now match your expectations?
[17:50:52] <ii14[m]> I'd personally recommend reading the README as the next step
[17:51:42] <arch-angel> yes
[17:51:43] <arch-angel> YES
[17:51:45] <arch-angel> IT DOES
[17:51:46] <arch-angel> WOW
[17:51:50] <arch-angel> HOHOHO
[17:52:03] <arch-angel> THIS IS CERTAINLY BEAUTIFUL
[17:52:18] <arch-angel> alright, time to configure clang-format
[17:52:21] <arch-angel> wish me luck

[17:52:41] <arch-angel> I'm thinking of using colemak
[17:52:51] <arch-angel> colemak with nvim
[17:52:56] <arch-angel> very bad idea, I love it
[17:53:16] <skebangaskebang4> Does anyone know if it's possible to "prime" `telescope.live_grep` with a search term?
[17:53:34] <bfredl> well it is a good idea if colemak in general is a good idea for you.
[17:53:51] <arch-angel> i've been practicing colemak on and off a few months now
[17:53:55] <sunjonSenghanBri> set `default_text='my query' in your picker config
[17:53:57] <skebangaskebang4> as in, run`live_grep` with a search term, and have telescope return the results, but then, as per usual `live_grep`, if I edit the prompt text, the grep job is rerun
[17:54:06] <arch-angel> pretty much know where every key is
[17:54:14] <sunjonSenghanBri> s/picker/theme, whatever the term is
[17:54:25] <bfredl> at some point you need to go all-in "on" for a while
[17:55:04] <skebangaskebang4> @sunjon AWESOME! thank you! :)
[17:59:32] <arch-angel> hmmmm I'm now thinking of being a little adventurous

[21:10:28] <sunjonSenghanBri> then that doesn't have any underline defined

[21:11:09] <sunjonSenghanBri> er.. italic
[21:11:40] <krackout> hmm... Let me check the output of `:verb hi Comment` on neovim 0.4.4

[21:17:32] <mizlan[m]> haha
[21:17:44] <mizlan[m]> Well I don't see any problems with it for now
[21:18:12] <sunjonSenghanBri> krackout:libera.chat: have you changed the loading order of your scripts?
[21:18:42] <sunjonSenghanBri> try setting `let g:gruvbox_italic=1` as early as possible in your init script
[21:18:58] <krackout> sunjonSenghanBri: no, it's the same. I actually use the same init.vim and plugins for both 0.6 & 0.4.4
[21:19:07] <sunjonSenghanBri> if it's set after the theme has done it's thing, it'll still report as #1, but do nothing
[21:19:34] <sunjonSenghanBri> there's been changes to the way that scripts load. lots of them
[21:19:49] <clason[m]> there were some changes around startup sequencing and syntax for 0.6 (to do with Lua config files)
[21:20:03] <clason[m]> I don't see how they should have that effect, but it's not impossible
[21:20:16] <ii14[m]> `setl nomodifiable` disables at least a good portion I guess
[21:20:16] <sunjonSenghanBri> rather than work out which might be the case, let's try establish wether the order is a factor
[21:20:22] <clason[m]> `:scriptnames` will tell you the order in which the files are sourced
[21:20:53] <clason[m]> the big question is: how do you set the gruvbox color scheme
[21:21:25] <ii14[m]> you could also set up autocommands and just revert what user did
[21:21:33] <ii14[m]> but that's even more hacky

[21:22:16] <mizlan[m]> well thats annoying... nvim_get_keymap() and nvim_buf_get_keymap() only return user defined keymaps
[21:22:38] <ii14[m]> well yeah, that's also true for normal `:map` and friends
[21:23:01] <ii14[m]> but basically every key does something
[21:23:04] <ii14[m]> check `:h index`
[21:23:37] <ii14[m]> I believe you also can create like a fake pty for terminal emulator somehow?
[21:23:42] <krackout> sunjonSenghanBri: It worked! I actually let gruvbox-italic before colorscheme gruvbox! But how does this work, shouldn't gruvbox be called first and then set its options?
[21:24:02] <ii14[m]> but that'd restrict keyboard input for insert mode only
[21:24:02] <sunjonSenghanBri> toldya
[21:24:32] <mizlan[m]> We can loop through all combinations of modifiers and type-able letters and set all of them to <Nop>
[21:25:04] <clason[m]> krackout: nope
[21:25:21] <clason[m]> you're controlling how gruvbox defines its colors, so you can't do that after the fact
[21:25:46] <ii14[m]> yeah I can't think of any other solution
[21:26:01] <ii14[m]> and that's the cleanest way to do it anyways

[22:28:16] <ii14[m]> so I can't for example run some process, and use rpcrequest on that?
[22:28:54] <bfredl> you can, but that process does have access to API of the nvim

[22:34:17] <bfredl> ii14[m]: libuv itself doesn't really manage communication between threads. luv implements some very rudimentary serialization of simple lua values
[22:34:46] <ii14[m]> couldn't you just copy values or is this a limitation of the lua interpreter?
[22:34:46] <bfredl> so when you use `async:send()` you can send over a string, or perhaps even a table of strings if you are lucky
