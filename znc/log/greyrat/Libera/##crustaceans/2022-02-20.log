[01:56:57] <epilys> is a PR titled "Fix broken main branch" too passive aggressive? (context: someone else merged broken stuff to `main`)
[01:59:28] <wrl> epilys: i'd go a little more descriptive and less passive aggressive in the summary, but then in the extended description definitely let loose
[01:59:35] <wrl> "commit ####### broke this"
[02:00:07] <epilys> To my defense the breaking commits themselves are basically titled "broken code"
[02:00:31] <edk> if your team's workflow depends on not breaking main i almost think you should hold a retro when main gets broken

[05:41:57] <imode> this is the dumbest fucking thing I have ever read.
[05:43:50] <manicennui> Why didn't this person just copy the design of resque/sidekiq from Ruby?
[05:44:05] <companion_cube> omg but what
[05:44:22] <companion_cube> > Speed: on a multi-core machine, execution times are 4x to 6x faster than a sequential execution.
[05:44:34] <companion_cube> yeah I doubt that it's as fast as using a thread pool properly
[05:46:47] <imode> jfc.
[05:47:36] <imode> "I don't know how to do concurrent execution so I'll embed an entire web server in my application just to run jobs"
[05:47:50] <imode> I'm terrified to see your other code.
[05:47:58] <imode> you need your programming license revoked.
[05:49:26] <manicennui> I mean, I think people should avoid thread code too.
[05:49:31] <manicennui> But there are better ways to do it.
[05:49:49] <companion_cube> I mean, I'm looking at the docs right now
[05:49:57] <imode> java has structured concurrency!!!!
[05:50:04] <companion_cube> literally you just have to build an executor, adn call `executor.submit(() -> …)` ??
[05:50:11] <companion_cube> can't get easier
[05:50:16] <imode> forget that, if you have operations on a collection, use fucking streams!
[05:50:24] <imode> you can just use .parallelStream()!!!
[05:50:27] <imode> fjisadjfudsahfoiuqwehjo
[05:50:37] <companion_cube> :D
[05:50:46] <companion_cube> this person doesn't deserve the jvm
[05:50:55] <imode> I'm sorry to whoever hired this idiot.
[05:50:59] <imode> you got fucked.
[05:51:07] <companion_cube> I mean in OCaml we're excited to be getting this exact same interface for multicore
[05:51:09] <manicennui> People are bad at writing thread safe code.
[05:51:13] <companion_cube> with a thread pool and futures
[05:51:15] <companion_cube> so, lol
[05:51:27] <imode> yeah but you can build structured stuff on top of that.
[05:51:47] <imode> manicennui: there's no excuse anymore in Java world. use concurrent collections and things that do the concurrency for you.
[05:52:01] <companion_cube> even futures are fine if you don't mutate outside the closure
[05:52:10] <companion_cube> if you don't mutate anything shared I mean
[05:52:30] <imode> Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4).parallel().reduce((first, second) -> first + second)
[05:52:45] <imode> ffs.
[05:52:52] <manicennui> companion_cube: What do you have against mutants, bigot?
[05:52:56] <companion_cube> b-b-b-ut you could have a microservice!!!
[05:53:06] <imode> you can literally build complex data pipelines in your application if you aren't an idiot about using streams.
[05:53:15] <companion_cube> manicennui: don't mutate shared stuff you communist mutant
[05:53:19] <imode> for as much shit as I give Java that's something I really enjoy.
[05:53:23] <manicennui> OUR state
[05:53:34] <companion_cube> *eagle soars*
[05:54:23] * manicennui notes that Perl even has an our keyword.
[05:54:51] <imode> it does?!
[05:54:58] <companion_cube> https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html really not bad
[05:54:58] <buttsbot> ExecutorService (Java Platform SE 7 )
[05:55:08] <manicennui> Yeah, it is how you declare global variables.
[05:55:18] * manicennui notes that Perl even has an our keyword.
[05:55:25] <manicennui> FUCK YOU IRCCLOUD
[05:55:40] <companion_cube> heh, fun stuff
[05:55:47] <companion_cube> opposed to `my` I imagine
[05:55:59] <manicennui> Yup.
[05:56:25] <imode> even without futures you can just phrase your task as something runnable/callable and do a parallel foreach over every task.
[05:56:49] <imode> there's so many ways to do it right..
[05:56:57] <companion_cube> so, so far postscript seems fun
[05:57:12] <companion_cube> `bind` is a bit weird I guess, but otherwise it's very simple, and should be easy to implement
[06:02:39] <manicennui> We should all use BEAM.
[06:03:51] <companion_cube> it's only recently becoming possible for folks like me :p
[06:04:32] <manicennui> Folks like you?
[06:04:39] <manicennui> French people weren't allowed to use BEAM?
[06:06:47] <companion_cube> folks who think in types
[06:07:27] <manicennui> What happened recently?
[06:07:39] <companion_cube> well, gleam is happening
[06:07:54] <companion_cube> not sure if it made the right choices, tbh — could have used more structural types — but it's there
[06:07:58] <manicennui> Hmm.
[06:08:49] <manicennui> I am seriously considering learning Elixir.
[06:09:01] <manicennui> Since I don't have your affliction. =P
[06:09:16] <manicennui> It seems to solve a lot of problems for those of us not working on Google scale problems.
[06:09:20] <companion_cube> if you're used to RoR it sounds like a good move yeah
[06:09:26] <manicennui> And perhaps even then.
[06:11:02] <manicennui> I wonder how complicated it is to run a BEAM app in production, especially across multiple machines.
[06:11:04] <companion_cube> it's probably the easiest way for non-google-scale companies to achieve google scale solution s:p
[06:11:11] <companion_cube> I mean, look at whatsapp
[06:11:19] <companion_cube> they had less than 50 engineers I think
[06:11:28] <klardotsh> I'm slowwwwwllllyyyyy getting the bootstrap compiler of https://github.com/klardotsh/gluumy/tree/tinker going now that the design feels semi-stable as something I might like to work with. had gleam had more structural types I'm not sure if I'd have gone down this rabbit hole :P
[06:11:28] <buttsbot> GitHub - klardotsh/gluumy at tinker
[06:11:47] <manicennui> I'm wondering if the ability of BEAM to run a distributed system across machines is simpler than running kubernetes, etc.
[06:11:59] <manicennui> It even has its own built in messaging.
[06:12:01] <companion_cube> manicennui: "probably"? :D
[06:12:24] <companion_cube> it's much better designed than containers, for sure, and you have baked in RPC
[06:13:11] <imode> companion_cube: I'm surprised you're enjoying PS.
[06:13:30] <companion_cube> I would never consider it for general purpose programming, imode
[06:13:42] <companion_cube> I'm considering it as a very-low-effort, special purpose language that is still flexible :)
[06:13:47] <imode> heh.

[06:45:41] <manicennui> The final season of The Walking Dead is split into three parts.
[06:45:46] <manicennui> I just want it to be over.
[06:46:05] <imode> how _long_ has that been running..
[06:46:33] <manicennui> Almost 12 years.
[06:46:48] <manicennui> It hasn't been good for a long time, but I've seen so much of it that I want to finish it.
[06:47:10] <manicennui> Part one of this season is just the same nonsense again.
[06:47:16] <manicennui> New group of "bad guys".
[06:47:23] <manicennui> Actually two new groups.
[06:47:28] <manicennui> One might be good.
[06:47:53] <manicennui> That is probably the group that the main cast will somehow fuck up.
[06:47:58] <manicennui> While fighting the second group.
[06:51:37] <companion_cube> I think I'm stalled at season 7 or 8 (the saviors)
[06:51:45] <companion_cube> been particularly gruesome
[07:03:27] <manicennui> Season 10 is terrible.
[07:03:43] <manicennui> Season 11 is slightly less bad, but it's just more of the same.
[07:04:23] <manicennui> I think season 10 was filmed during the height of the pandemic, so they had to do a lot of scenes with just one or two characters. I think they thought they were doing something interesting, but it was just really boring.
[07:04:34] <companion_cube> oooof ok
[07:05:31] <manicennui> But yeah, I think the saviors is the last mildly interesting thing they did.
[07:05:46] <companion_cube> I've stopped, for now, at the beginning of season 7
[07:06:05] <companion_cube> it's kind of crazy that it goes on for so long afterwards, I'm barely over half?? :s
[07:07:40] <companion_cube> at least i hope they plan for a decent ending?
[07:11:10] <manicennui> Is there really a good way to end it?
[07:11:27] <manicennui> I think that's the problem with a show that is basically a soap opera that goes on as long as ratings are good.
[07:11:53] <manicennui> Without some overall plan, it is never going to end well.
[07:12:02] <companion_cube> ah well
[07:12:18] <manicennui> I don't know how the comic ended, but it has diverged a lot from the comic.
[07:12:28] <companion_cube> I thought they had a plan, especially if they had decided there was a final season
[07:12:37] <manicennui> There are also a couple of spinoffs that are basically the same show.
[07:12:47] <manicennui> I think ratings aren't as good.
[07:13:01] <manicennui> And several main actors have left.
[07:13:06] <companion_cube> like "fear the walking dead"?
[07:13:11] <companion_cube> ah? oops
[07:13:31] <manicennui> Yeah.
[07:13:50] <companion_cube> in the main one, or spinoffs?
[07:14:03] <manicennui> In the main series.
[07:14:26] <companion_cube> ah damn. so that's why they're ending it.

[08:41:52] <bkero> Why do you hate freedom?
[08:42:14] <gwozniak> He said that they only wanted to meet with the gov't and were instead met with violence
[08:42:28] <gwozniak> Then he started to say "I've studied the science..."
[08:42:34] <imode> is the pandemic fucking over?
[08:43:08] <companion_cube> I just want a separate counter for vaccinated and unvaccinated deaths
[08:43:08] <gwozniak> The broadcast cut away when he started in on that, but I caught a little bit of him saying that "the virus is only 2 microns, so masks..."
[08:43:16] <companion_cube> so I can worry only about the former
[08:43:19] <imode> companion_cube: fucking same.
[08:43:34] <imode> gwozniak: lol.
[08:43:40] <companion_cube> the latter is interesting but at this point it shouldn't drive public policy
[08:43:47] <gwozniak> So yeah, they only wanted to talk to the government
[08:44:12] <imode> yeah that'd be valid.. if the virus could just float 100% independently of any media.
[08:44:49] <imode> 72.7% of washington is fully vax'd?!
[08:44:54] <imode> fuuuuuuck yeeeeeeah.
[08:45:08] <gwozniak> The reporters for CBC talked to a lot of protestors. The reporters were like, "where do they get this info, because it's totally wrong"

[08:53:40] <companion_cube> hopefully it's rare
[08:54:03] <gwozniak> That restriction goes away soon, and I won't be doing a repeat performance until I can sit outside
[08:54:58] <defect> i saw fake cards at my local bar :(
[08:55:19] <companion_cube> oh damn
[08:55:24] <companion_cube> how did you know?
[08:55:29] <defect> they fucking told me
[08:55:39] <defect> older boomer couple came in sat down next to me
[08:55:42] <defect> started chatting a bit
[08:55:45] <companion_cube> oh ffs
[08:55:46] <gwozniak> We have QR codes that are scanned by an app provided by the province
[08:56:10] <gwozniak> Can be faked, but probably a little harder
[08:56:12] <companion_cube> that's how you get people going to the ER, and then having to admit their cards are fakes
[08:56:23] <defect> suddenly the wife starts talkling about how vaccines are BS and tells me they didn't get it
[08:56:32] <bkero> Washington puts those vaccine entries in a certificate chain.
[08:56:33] <defect> when i ask how they got in she just said fake cards
[08:56:42] <companion_cube> ahah I can imagine the backing away reflex
[08:56:47] <gwozniak> defect: classy
[08:56:50] <defect> yeah, i was outta there pretty quickky
[08:56:52] <defect> quickly
[08:56:56] <bkero> Did you tell the bartender on your way out?
[08:57:02] <gwozniak> Did you tell them to fuck off, too?
[08:57:08] <defect> i did, they don't really care anymore :(
[08:57:08] <bkero> I imagine they'd like to throw their asses out too
[08:57:17] <bkero> That's unfortunate.
[08:57:53] <defect> i didn't see it though, so don't know the quality of the fake
[08:58:12] <companion_cube> in the US it's probably super easy, the cards are just cardboard
[08:58:12] <defect> i guess its easier to close your eyes and cover your ears than try to get the police to come do something about it

[19:12:10] <gerikson> ``if you already have adjunctions hanging around, you get a monad (and a comonad) from each of them in a very natural way. If you’re familiar with order theory by any chance, this is a direct generalisation of how you get a closure operator from a Galois connection between partially ordered sets.''
[19:13:17] <gwozniak> Sometimes Category Theory feels like the String Theory of computer science
[19:14:26] <riv> string theory uses a ton of category theory
[19:15:57] <gwozniak> I am referring to its mostly abstract, near uselessness for most things
[19:16:10] <riv> oh yeah im saying you're spot on
[19:19:07] <riv> so from Cales comment, i gather than in the math world - monads were used to generically describe stuff like groups, rings etc.
[19:19:29] <riv> and then at some point Wadler(was he the first?) start using them in programming languages
[19:19:37] <Geekingfrog> I've worked at a place doing pretty much 100% haskell, and there was definitely a divide between very academic people, who would dive into category theory at the first opportunity. And ppl more focused on engineering, and interested in api design or compile time.
