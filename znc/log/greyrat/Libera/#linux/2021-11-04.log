[00:05:09] <TJ-> rendar: that example show that if your present working directory is the mountpoint and you mount over it, your /current/ shell is still in the underlying directory and so reports your user ownership. But as soon as you leave that directory and enter the mountpoint you see root owns it, since that is the 'root' of the mounted file-system
[00:06:20] <rendar> TJ-, my problem is that when i mount my filesystem, i always see root.root, and i CANNOT create files as a user!
[00:06:24] <rendar> i cannot use the filesystem...

[07:19:36] <[[R]]> what do you mean priority

[07:20:41] <[[R]]> on boot, it is loaded from RTC

[07:21:34] <blinux> Hmm. Well, my RTC time is wrong.

[07:23:23] <[[R]]> well UTC is suppeod to not be your local time
[07:23:24] <[[R]]> tahts kinda the point
[07:23:27] <blinux> And my local time is correct
[07:23:43] <blinux> Ok, well it looks like UTC is being coppied to the RTC or something.
[07:23:47] <[[R]]> yes

[07:23:55] <blinux> Oh, ok
[07:23:58] <blinux> Right
[07:24:20] <[[R]]> "local time" is just taking what it thinks the timzone is, and adjusting the UTC time with it

[10:00:24] <Voxel> The main issue is that 95% of script requires root, but 5% doesn't and here's an issue - these 5% include `tshark` which doesn't like root, and it's okay since it supports insecure plugins. So, i set to launch `tshark` with "nobody", but the issue is that it doesn't have access to the files (to the absolute path - includes a mounted directory with
[10:00:25] <Voxel> 750 root:root) which were previously created with root with the same script. So, it's either a /tmp folder usage or a normal user, I guess (I don't want to set the mounted directory to 755).

[10:07:31] <Voxel> p` as mentioned above, it's already used with "nobody", but here's the permission issue where the mount directory is 750 root:root
[10:07:51] <Voxel> Like /mnt/750/1/2/3/4/scriptDir/

[11:26:57] <jim> pikapika, example... one good thing to do, is have /home on a separate partition (many reasons, later :) and so, if it's in fstab, it gets mounted somewhat early in the boot process, so a user who logs in probably can't tell

[11:28:38] <tirnanog> velix: I'd suggest re-invoking pv for the given file descriptor as geirha indieated. there are other ways, but that way will likely lead to fewer surprises.
[11:28:42] <tirnanog> indicated
[11:28:42] <geirha> extern: it will if there are lines that start with 8 or more spaces
[11:29:05] <jim> pikapika, borg backup can double as a good backup program, and an assistant in copying over the existing /home to the new partition
[11:29:09] <extern> geirha: ok i rather want to delete all spaces and replace them with single tab
[11:29:26] <pikapika> jim, thanks
[11:29:48] <jim> a little complex to learn, you'll grow to love it (well, most likely anyway)
[11:29:56] <pikapika> But I think the difference in layout between old and new system is a bit much this time and I'd rather dd, mv etc manually rn

[11:36:20] <tirnanog> velix: that said, you could use a process substitution to keep one instance of pv running in the background. I'm just not sure that it would confer any obvious advantage for the example given.

[11:38:13] <jim> to use borg, that involves having some storage space in the middle, which borg uses as a repository... to do this kind of copy of a whole dir tree, you would: backup the dir tree you want, format and mount the new partition, somewhere like /mnt,

[11:39:01] <pikapika> jim, does this temporary space have to be on a separate disk
[11:39:10] <pikapika> or can it use free space within the "src" machine too
[11:39:44] <jim> nope, doesnb't have to be (altho there are advantages to doing so
[11:40:01] <jim> ) keep forgetting the close paren
[11:40:24] <jim> you could make a repo there, yes
[11:41:26] <jim> maybe not a separate disk, but a separate partition might be good enough
[11:41:37] *** Joins: rpthms (~rpthms@user/rpthms)
[11:42:08] <pikapika> jim, I mean if I have to ferry around the archive to the new system anyways I think it'd be best to directly build the repo on the external disk I am using for that purpose
[11:42:46] *** Quits: cmbengue (~Thunderbi@207.191.249.160) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[11:42:50] <jim> you could do that too, and then either use something like borg or not
[11:44:04] <jim> the advantage to using borg (esp. if you're going to keep the repo), is you've made a backup of (for example) /home
[11:44:44] <jim> borg has this weird thing, if you've made a backup on borg, you could mount that backup

[18:05:59] <ThothCastel> it possible to run office 2019 with wine?
[18:06:17] <XJ8> I don't think it works, you're better off using office 365 in the browser.
[18:06:34] <ThothCastel> ah yes good point
[18:06:36] <ThothCastel> thanks
[18:06:40] <XJ8> No problem.
[18:06:56] <ThothCastel> XJ8:  what about Edge browser?
[18:07:15] <ThothCastel> got an app that only supports Edge or IE
[18:07:38] <XJ8> Edge is coming to linux, isn't stable release yet, no idea if non windows versions will have internet explorer mode in it.
[18:07:59] <NiLon> isn't it already?
[18:08:04] <paulcarroty> try to change user agent
[18:08:06] <XJ8> I was wrong
[18:08:16] <XJ8> ThothCastel you can install edge browser on linux right now
[18:08:58] <XJ8> As in, stable release is available. Native linux.
[18:09:49] <NiLon> office 2019 has silver rating in wine, meaning it works but not without some asterisk
[18:10:32] <ThothCastel> nice one thanks
[18:10:52] <NiLon> tho I would not consider that as a good option

[19:24:21] <luva> permissions are same right
[19:24:34] <kfrench> luva: Again, that's your call.  it'll depend on what else that host is used for and who else has access.
[19:25:17] <kfrench> luva: It's security in depth.  If only you have access, then it's "safe".  If only you have access to that network, then it's "safer".  If the machine is encased in concrete and sunk to the bottom of the ocean, then it's "safest".
[19:25:36] <luva> I know its my call kfrench. I just want to clarify one thing. Lets say I save the path within ~/.ssh/SSH_AUTH_SOCK with permissions 500 and read it from a script that is executable by the same user, then its the same as just saving it into the file itself
[19:25:52] <luva> its the same risk in both, is what I want to clarify
[19:25:53] *** Joins: jcvfen (~jcvfen@user/jcvfen)
[19:26:17] <kfrench> Yes, but the socket itself will change each time ssh-agent is started.  You generally would want to store that in its own file, as you'd need to change it often.
[19:26:43] <luva> alright thats good to know
[19:26:43] <kfrench> You wouldn't want to modify your backup script all of the time, as its more complicated and you risk breaking it just for a path change.
[19:26:49] <luva> I didnt know it changes all the time
[19:27:01] <kfrench> So, I'd store that path in its own file and then load that file from the backup script.

[21:49:33] <Psi-Jack> I like Fedora. It's solid. They've broken individual parts that were not entirely show-stopping situations, sure, but they've never made the system so unusable that it'd take hours to fix. And they usually fixed the issue within a week or less. The one exception was when they broke ghostscript, breaking printing for a few months.

[23:51:32] <Psi-Jack> Yeah, there is no flatpak daemon running like there is for snapd.
[23:51:57] <blackgatonegro> By what I have seen it has not got any better, flatpak gets as many complains as pulseaudio does and is way less fixable on the user end.
[23:52:10] <jcbjoe2021> I wanna see when a file was last modified is ls -l the best way or ls-lt ?
[23:52:16] <evilop> jcbjoe2021: stat
[23:52:21] <bparker> ayecee: the idea of making a single package that runs across all/most distros is supposed to be the issue that flatpak/appimage/snap/etc. solves... but because of differing glibc versions, this is still not solved

[23:53:44] <stanrifkin> bparker: so linux doen't look in the local directory first for glibc?
[23:53:52] <blackgatonegro> As least pulseaudio doesn't have most problems waiting until a new release or an update on the app you are using on flatpak.  You can go and fix things yourself, use workarounds.

[23:55:14] <evilop> (doesn't have to deal with alsa after all....)
[23:55:25] <blackgatonegro> evilop not in my experience then again when ubuntu started to show it down the throat it was still quite new
[23:55:31] <bparker> if you compile a flatpak on ubuntu 18, it will not run on ubuntu 16
[23:55:45] <bparker> because the newer app uses glibc features that only exist in the newer glibc
[23:55:54] <stanrifkin> bparker: as i remember the program is linked with ld-linux which searches for other dynamic libs
[23:55:57] <ayecee> bparker: will it run on ubuntu 20?
[23:56:01] <evilop> blackgatonegro: "it" being pulse or flatpak? in case of the later then you are quite confused

[23:56:44] <evilop> since ubuntu does it hardest to pretend that flatpak doesn't exist and that snap rules the world
[23:57:48] <blackgatonegro> evilop I can usually solve pulseaudio problems blacklisting something or running a terminal app. If something doesn't run right on flatpak I usually try to find the not flatpak version.
[23:58:20] <jcbjoe2021> How do I use regex in find command say the file is ‘file fix.txt is it ‘file*/.txt’ or what do I do?
[23:58:24] <blackgatonegro>  evilop the only snap I know is the app.
[23:59:44] <bparker> jcbjoe2021: that's not a regex, that's wildcard/glob syntax
[23:59:45] <Kingsy> can someone recommend a good torrent client? deluge is really annoying me. whenever I download a torrent my internet connections crawls to a halt.
[23:59:45] <blackgatonegro> Then again maybe it was snap instead, is been years and Haven't boot up ubuntu since version 20... just boot it up, it was so ugly I keep using mint.
