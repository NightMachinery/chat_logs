[23:06:19] <shoshin> how is everyone doing this October? it both feels like long ago and just yesterday we were together at emacs conf 2020
[23:06:43] <zaeph> Doing fine here. :)
[23:07:32] <shoshin> :D good to hear zaeph - i've pointed a few folks in the direction of org-roam this past year, though yet to take the plunge myself
[23:08:04] <zaeph> I thank thee for thine offering.
[23:20:43] <bandali> doing okay shoshin :) yourself?
[23:20:47] <bandali> indeed, kinda hard to believe it's nearly been a year..
[23:22:18] <shoshin> doing okay as well. been trying to keep life stable while things keep shifting. figuring out the places i want to spend the small bits of time i get for personal projects. good to "see" you again :)
[23:30:29] <bandali> gotcha gotcha, makes sense
[23:30:35] <bandali> good to 'see' ya as well :)
[23:34:03] <shoshin> i'm currently trying to bootstrap some kind of local "tech co-op" to leverage, promote, and provide for members via Free Software, but its in very beginning stages
[23:34:15] <shoshin> mostly an excuse for me to mess around with a guix server
[23:35:24] <bandali> oh cool, sounds great!
[23:42:56] *** Quits: ullbeking_ (sid5364@id-5364.ilkley.irccloud.com) ()
[23:43:09] <shoshin> well i just emailed my proposal. i apologize for being late, September was an odd month. if it doesn't work out this time I totally understand! I know you all will put on a wonderful conference once again this year. If there's anything I can do to help point me in the right direction!
[23:43:12] *** Joins: ullbeking_ (sid5364@id-5364.ilkley.irccloud.com)
[23:43:34] <shoshin> i'll start hanging around in here again, i need to get some irc bumper up so i'm not constantly getting disconnected :\
[23:45:16] <bandali> awesome, i'll check later tonight
[23:45:36] <zaeph> FYI, it's called a 'bouncer', not a 'bumper'; just to save you some headache with your next web-search. :o)
[23:45:48] <bandali> as for helping out, i can't think of anything on the spot but i'm your it'll come to me later. perhaps sachac and/or zaeph could chime in :)
[23:46:02] <bandali> one thing we could definitely use help with would be transcribing/captioning talks
[23:46:32] <shoshin> cool. bouncer good to know. it didn't sound quite right ;)
[23:47:41] <pkal> shoshin: If you have a VPS, the "soju" bouncer is easy to set up
[23:59:50] <shoshin> pkal: thanks for the tip :) i was hoping to set it up as a guix service
