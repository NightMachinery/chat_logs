[18:44:17] <pal[m]> Oh I'm thinking of getting some crypto
[18:44:34] <relejek[m]> trust wallet supports most kind. 
[18:44:55] <relejek[m]> there is also metamask.
[18:45:14] <pal[m]> Yeah I've heard of metamask
[18:45:25] <pal[m]> There are so many
[18:45:26] <pal[m]> So I thought I'd ask around and see what people are recommending
[18:45:38] <relejek[m]> i am not sure metamask has phone app
[18:45:39] <relejek[m]> it matters which currency you want to buy.
[18:46:20] <pal[m]> Does it matter which wallet I end choosing?
[18:46:21] <relejek[m]> trust wallet supports the large number of blockchains. also the most popular ones.
[18:47:04] <pal[m]> Im just trying to get my feet wet
[18:47:05] <relejek[m]> no it does not actually. most good wallets are actually portable using the secret key.

[18:48:18] <relejek[m]> pal:  which currency you want to buy though? 
[18:48:19] <pal[m]> relejek[m]: Oh alright thanks man
[18:48:19] <relejek[m]> just go with trust wallet for now. if you don't like it then you can switch. it supports the most number of currency that i know of.
[18:48:20] <pal[m]> relejek[m]: Uh ethereum rn
[18:48:51] <relejek[m]> sure go with it.
[18:48:52] <pal[m]> alright man
[18:49:23] <pal[m]> Thanks!
[18:49:23] <relejek[m]> also..... if you wish to buy monero then it is different thing.
[18:50:16] <Tor[m]> Store it in cold wallets
[18:50:24] <Tor[m]> And hold it
[18:50:24] <pal[m]> relejek[m]: How come?
[18:50:25] <Tor[m]> Think of it as gold

[18:50:56] <pal[m]> Tor[m]: What's a cold wallet?
[18:50:57] <Tor[m]> Cause gov cannot monitor/tax it

[18:51:40] <Tor[m]> pal[m]: Ha they cannot monitor it so ban kaise kar sakte hai

[18:53:01] <pal[m]> Oh my
[18:53:23] <relejek[m]> Tor: they can monitor exhanges. they are like any other registered company that comes under govt. regulation. RBI and SEBI has power on them
[18:54:04] <relejek[m]> pal[m]: don't buy any currency coz a public figure tells you to. please don't. 
[18:54:05] <pal[m]> Pls forgive my ignorance, but if I want to pay you say a thousand rupees in btc.. do I have to go through an exchange?
[18:54:19] <Tor[m]> relejek[m]: Ha but wo log apne ko tax nahi kar sakte na 
[18:54:39] <pal[m]> relejek[m]: Yeah definitely that wasn't my only reason lol
[18:54:41] <testuser[m]> vro just trade notes

[18:54:53] <Tor[m]> testuser[m]: Notes ka value girta hai na
[18:55:24] <Tor[m]> Abhi it is lighter to carry gold than cash
[18:55:25] <Tor[m]> Of same value
[18:55:25] <relejek[m]> pal:  nope. that is a private transaction . you can give and receive almost any crypto currency without exchange and govt knowing about it.
[18:58:14] <relejek[m]> Tor[m]: who know if govt. accepts crypto-c then they may ask you to declare that in your tax reports.
[18:58:14] <Tor[m]> <pal[m]> "What if smth happens to my..." <- Bhai wo alag se wallet aata hai 
[18:58:15] <pal[m]> relejek[m]: Ah thanks
[18:58:17] <relejek[m]> just like declaring your cash income. they don't need to change anything.
[18:58:29] <Tor[m]> > <@relejek:matrix.org> > <@t0r:denshi.org> Ha but wo log apne ko tax nahi kar sakte na

[18:58:29] <Tor[m]> > who know if govt. accepts crypto-c then they may ask you to declare that in your tax reports.
[18:58:29] <Tor[m]> Ha but tujhe decide karna hai na ki declare karna hai ki nahi
[18:58:29] <pal[m]> I see
[19:03:45] <relejek[m]> yeah. but if you don't and get caught then it would be treated as black money and then the consequences applies.
[19:03:46] <relejek[m]> and in case of BTC and ETH all IRS have to do is prove that you control a certain wallet on the network. 
[19:03:59] <relejek[m]> or they can just ask everyone to connect their PAN to their wallet then they would know everything about your crypto-c transactions.
[19:04:23] <Tor[m]> relejek[m]: Ha no anonymity
[19:05:04] <Tor[m]> Bitcoin bhi accha hai but kyc ke baad toh rupiye se bhi kharab hai
[19:05:05] <Tor[m]> Government ka wet dream
[19:07:03] <Tor[m]> Tbh i only know about btc xmr wownero and chia i don't know how ETH work
[19:09:31] <relejek[m]> btc is over-hyped cos it the first, original, "pure on its principles", mysterious. 
[19:10:15] <relejek[m]> eth has more utility as most dapps are built on it that provides building block for new era of fintechs
