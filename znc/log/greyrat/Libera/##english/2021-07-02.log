[00:01:04] <TechTest> "proper"?
[00:01:24] <raccoon_dog> I think both work, but "respect" may be the more idiomatic option.
[00:01:48] <darsie> thanks
[00:02:06] <armin> the safe-word in BDSM is actually just something you both agree about.
[00:02:14] <darsie> TechTest: As in how it should be.
[00:02:56] <TechTest> like how should it be?
[00:03:02] <raccoon_dog> armin: Well, I think the question here is, "What is the word used to describe that all parties involved will use the safe word when it's supposed to be used."
[00:03:07] <TechTest> I mean.. never mind
[00:03:19] <raccoon_dog> So, it's possible that you have a bad partner who doesn't listen to you when you use the safe word.
[00:03:23] <armin> raccoon_dog: hmmm, "agreement" i guess?
[00:03:24] <darsie> If A bonds B and has sex with B even though B says the safe word, it's not BDSM but rape.
[00:03:27] <raccoon_dog> That would not "respecting" the safe word.
[00:03:42] <TechTest> what's the safe word?
[00:03:44] <raccoon_dog> Yeah, exactly, it crosses over into nonconsensual territory.
[00:03:49] <darsie> Whatever you agree on.
[00:03:54] <armin> darsie: exactly that.
[00:04:12] <raccoon_dog> TechTest: So, in these sorts of scenarios, a word or a phrase is previously agreed upon so that when that word or phrase is used, all activity ceases.
[00:04:16] <darsie> Some word you would not normally use during BDSM.
[00:04:33] <darsie> like "Yagi antenna".
[00:04:45] <TechTest> raccoon_dog: ahh, didn't know that
[00:05:30] <raccoon_dog> Yeah, because these sorts of activities can involve roughhousing and testing a partner's limits, so you need a safe word so that nobody ends up hurt.

[00:14:36] <darsie> For some leaving the light on is kinky.

[00:16:25] <armin> yeah but still, let's try to be respectful and friendly at least.
[00:17:18] <raccoon_dog> I guess swearing is one thing; discussing sexual acts in detail doesn't personally make me comfortable, though.

[05:52:15] <kexec> I noticed that when referencing to specific eu regulation, there is not used the definite article ("the") - for example: "rules laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/953"; why is that?
[06:01:52] <LjL> kexec, not sure i know how to answer that, but it's not limited to EU regulation, you would also generally say "refer to Article 1 of the Law on...", not "the Article 1"
[06:02:14] <LjL> in a way, the number of the thing is already making it definite
[06:02:29] <LjL> but that doesn't fully answer since you'd still say "I've watched the movie '2001'"

[09:15:31] <mdogg> ^ Correct.  There is no 'dot' after the "th"
[09:16:44] <r3> augh*  Please help me correct this?  "I don't approve of Steve's and your choice of colors..."
[09:17:49] <r3> '...your and Steve's...' ?
[09:18:05] <mdogg> "I don't approve of the choice of colors that you and Stevie chose." 
[09:18:54] <mdogg> Or, your could replace "chose" with "picked".
[09:19:18] <mdogg> "I don't approve of the choice of colors that you and Stevie picked."
[09:19:18] <r3> I can rearrange that ok, fine, but what about "What I can't understand is Steve's and your treatment of the walls" ?
[09:20:20] <r3> 'the treatment of the walls by you and Steve' seems - to me - backward?
[09:20:50] <OMGOMG> r3: what needs to be corrected?
[09:21:10] <r3> hmm, might be beter the 2nd way following mdogg's lead
[09:21:16] <mdogg> To me it sounds (and reads better) to say, "What I can't understand is why you and Stevie did that to the walls."  I would always put "you" before "Stevie".
[09:21:36] <r3> ah there it is, thank you mdogg, that flows much better

[10:03:45] <TechTest> is "approve" really the correct word?
[10:04:12] <raccoon_dog> It's a valid possibility, sure.
[10:04:28] <TechTest> how can you 'approve' a color?
[10:05:11] <raccoon_dog> No -- read what kurahaupo said. "Approve OF"
[10:05:14] <raccoon_dog> https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english-thesaurus/approve-of-something-or-someone
[10:05:29] <raccoon_dog> That's a phrasal verb with a specific meaning.
[10:05:57] <TechTest> ah
[10:06:19] <TechTest> it sounds a bit odd, but yeah it makes sense 
[10:07:01] <kurahaupo> I just thought the "choices you chose" seemed a bit repetitive
[10:07:26] <raccoon_dog> Yeah, using cognates so close to each other is a bit cacophonous.
[10:07:32] <TechTest> "I don't like the colors you chose"
[10:09:24] <kurahaupo> approval can imply some reason or purpose, whereas liking can be just instinctive
[10:09:53] <TechTest> exactly
[10:10:15] <TechTest> that's why I feel it's odd to use "approval" for a color 
[10:10:28] <TechTest> because color is just a liking

[13:54:13] <darsie> I just read the abstract.
[13:54:26] <TechTest> I also believe that they mean "salt" instead of "sodium"
[13:55:22] <darsie> Yeah, that's why I read it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt#Sodium_consumption_and_health quoted their 4-5 g figure and I checked if they actually meant sodium. Very odd.
[13:56:12] <TechTest> I'd say it's not a proper study analysis paper
[13:56:39] <TechTest> 7g sodium/day is insanely high
[13:57:05] <TechTest> I would be surprised if that study can be confirmed by other sources 
[13:59:04] <TechTest> just checked 7g of sodium are equal to 17,774 g of salt
[13:59:19] <TechTest> I doubt it's even possible to consume that much salt
[13:59:28] <darsie> It certainly is.

[14:34:18] <kurahaupo> So it is normal to quote the mass of sodium (molar mass 23) rather than salt (molar mass 35.5+23=58.5), sk4-5 grams of sodium corresponds to about 10-13 grams of salt.

[14:39:15] <kurahaupo> TechTest: In most of the English speaking world we would write 17.774g

Is the ability to exchange data is what make a group of computers a network or is the existence of a physical link between 2 or more computers even if they are not able to exchange data enough to call it a network?

[22:57:36] <raccoon_dog> Bayes: I'd say neither. "You aren't tired." "I'm not?" Usually the "Am I (not)" or "Aren't I?" constructions are used to end a sentence. "I'm pretty, aren't I?"
[22:58:05] <raccoon_dog> Also, "Am I (not)?" is the more formal version. Most people would use "Aren't I?"
[22:58:46] <Bayes> and the positive? Am I? Are I?
[22:59:26] <raccoon_dog> Well, the usual rule of thumb is affirmative + negative or negative + affirmative. So, for example, "I'm not silly, am I?"
[23:00:25] <Bayes> so, the second part (after the comma) is one of these two: am I? or aren't I?
[23:00:53] <raccoon_dog> When referring to yourself, yes. (The "I" pronoun.)
[23:01:09] <Bayes> okay gotcha
[23:01:38] <Bayes> I wanted to know whether I should use "are" in the negative only
[23:02:07] <raccoon_dog> Right -- you'd say "Aren't I?" but never "Are I?"
[23:02:22] <Bayes> got it chief, thanks raccoon_dog
[23:02:31] <raccoon_dog> No problem.
[23:12:53] <toretto> darsie: But that isn't my question though. My question is regarding the usage of "interpretation"
[23:14:17] * kurahaupo sidesteps aren't I vs amn't I, and opts instead for "I wouldn't be serious, would I?"
[23:17:04] <darsie> toretto: Water is commonly written as H2O in chemistry.
[23:18:05] <darsie> It's not an interpretation, because water and H2O are the same thing.
[23:18:19] <toretto> darsie: How about the 2nd sentence? I *specifically* wanted to use the word "interpretation". That's the whole purpose. 
[23:19:04] <darsie> Red light is often interpreted as 'Halt'.
[23:19:25] <raccoon_dog> toretto: What is the question?
[23:19:26] <toretto> darsie: My 2nd sentence was "Interpretation of half-cut apple to Apple Inc is relly common among software engineers."
[23:19:28] <raccoon_dog> (I joined late.)
[23:19:52] <toretto> raccoon_dog: I was asking, is this a valid sentence: "Interpretation of half-cut apple to Apple Inc is relly common among software engineers."
[23:20:29] <toretto> s/relly/really/
[23:20:30] <tinsoldier> t​oretto meant: raccoon_dog: I was asking, is this a valid sentence: "Interpretation of half-cut apple to Apple Inc is really common among software engineers."
[23:20:37] <darsie> Half cut apple is interpreted as Beatles lable. Bitten apple is interpreted as Computer company.
[23:21:04] <darsie> A half cut apple is interpreted as Beatles lable. A bitten apple is interpreted as Computer company.
[23:21:12] <toretto> Yeah, whatever :) bitten apple is what I really mean. 
[23:21:19] <raccoon_dog> Maybe something like "Associating a bitten (not half-cut) apple to Apple is really common among software engineers."
[23:21:55] <raccoon_dog> You probably don't have to use "Apple Inc." People will know you mean the company if you capitalize it and mention bitten apples.
[23:22:13] <toretto> Is it possiable to have the word "interpretation" at the beginning of the sentence?
[23:22:40] <raccoon_dog> Well, "interpretation" means something a bit different imho. Rather, people *associate* the bitten apple with the company's logo.
[23:22:58] <raccoon_dog> Or, more accurately, with the company, since a bitten apple is their logo.
[23:23:28] <toretto> I see, so "associate" is better word. 
[23:23:39] <raccoon_dog> I believe so.

[23:32:53] <kurahaupo> darsie: I would hope that water would be written H₂O rather than H2O. However H₂O isn't just water, it's also steam & ice. And water isn't always H₂O; sometimes it dissociates into H₃O⁺ and H₃O₂⁻, which is the mechanism for water's remarkable surface tension.

[23:33:28] <raccoon_dog> Autoprotolysis or self-ionization, indeed. 
[23:34:29] <huf> ice and steam are water the way radio waves are light
[23:34:30] <kurahaupo> It's been shown that surface tension increases enormously when an electric current is flowing through the water
[23:34:31] <huf> it's fine :)
[23:34:32] <darsie> I don't know how to write subscript here easily.
[23:35:14] <kurahaupo> huf: They're all just extremely soft γ rays
[23:35:16] <raccoon_dog> huf: "light" is admittedly ambiguous. Some people do use it to mean that part of the electromagnetic spectrum that humans can see.

[23:35:24] <raccoon_dog> Even though all of that is EM waves.

[23:36:40] <kurahaupo> mmm, yum, bread
[23:39:23] <kurahaupo> We get taught at school that water has 3 phases (like most things) but the reality is much much more complicated. At least three liquid and ten solid phases have been documented
[23:39:38] <raccoon_dog> Yeah, ice in particular is pretty interesting.
[23:40:00] <raccoon_dog> Depending on how it crystalized, there are a bunch of kinds of ice.
[23:40:39] <kurahaupo> Admittedly some of those ice phases only exist in "centre of planet" pressure levels
[23:41:08] <raccoon_dog> Yeah, true.

[23:45:20] <kurahaupo> The observation that water expands as the temperature goes from 4°C to 0°C is because it changes to a semi lattice form, H₂ₙOₙ. And its surface does the self ionizing trick, which is how a water droplet can momentarily sit on top of a flat water surface; or form clouds where all the micro droplets stay separate and don't always immediately fall
[23:46:41] <kurahaupo> And cellular biology relies on these weird and wonderful behaviours.
