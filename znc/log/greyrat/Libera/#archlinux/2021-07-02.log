[00:08:37] <BrainDamage> that's kind of odd, arch goes through minimal patching as policy, so in principle it should be similar to gentoo

[01:28:36] <Aardwolf> Hi, on a laptop with touchpad, I use edge scrolling. If I press a mouse button, edge scrolling stops until moving the mouse cursor. I don't want that, I want edge scrolling to work after pressing a button. Cinnamon has no setting. Is there a config file with more setting somewhere?

[01:35:57] <matthewcroughan> I've tested this in a VM, and am actively rebuilding it and trying to figure out why now.
[01:36:33] <matthewcroughan> The error is that Nix cannot access /usr/bin, so therefore all things fail with /usr/bin/sh not found whenever builds start.

[04:00:31] <matthewcroughan> but yes, enabling the service and starting creates the /nix/store.
[04:01:19] <matthewcroughan> at that point, if the user tries to run `nix-shell -p hello`, they'll be told basically to add a channel.
[04:01:29] <thrice> arch's policy is to not start systmed services upon installation

[04:01:44] <matthewcroughan> grawlinson: telling people to add a user channel is bad advice, in my opinion, this is not the style of Nix.
[04:02:01] <matthewcroughan> The root and user channels are separate, so by telling someone to add a user channel and a root channel it is easy to confuse the two.
[04:02:20] <grawlinson> https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#ch-basic-package-mgmt
[04:02:20] <matthewcroughan> whereas, if you set only a root channel, the user will automatically use that, and can from that point onwards choose to have a user channel later if they want to modify things without root.

[04:03:58] <grawlinson> the unstable docs say to add a channel too

[04:04:51] <matthewcroughan> These are things that are not understood until later, as you begin to understand and use Nix.

[04:05:49] <matthewcroughan> you now have the busybox version of `man` not the gnu one. So `man ls` tries to do things wrong. Because you've got that in your environment overriding everything else permanently now, it is hard to trace that back.
[04:05:52] *** Joins: bhava (~Thunderbi@89.36.78.201)
[04:06:13] <matthewcroughan> So, the practice is to tell people not to use nix-env. There's a meme about it here.https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gytis-ivaskevicius/high-quality-nix-content/master/memes/nixenv-vs-nixshell.png
[04:06:24] <matthewcroughan> whoops, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gytis-ivaskevicius/high-quality-nix-content/master/memes/nixenv-vs-nixshell.png
[04:06:52] <grawlinson> isn't that what nix-shell is for?
[04:06:53] <matthewcroughan> Similarly, having a root and user channel is confusing, for the same reason "pip" and "sudo pip" is confusing.
[04:06:55] <matthewcroughan> Does that make sense?
[04:07:00] <thrice> you've somehow made my opinion of nix worse
[04:07:10] <matthewcroughan> grawlinson: yes it is :P
[04:07:32] <matthewcroughan> Dnd so the practice of telling people to use nix-env is bad. It doesn't mean the manual is incorrect, and it's also what people coming from a mutable/imperative distribution expect.

[04:08:50] <matthewcroughan> The Arch wiki doesn't tell you best practices all the time either.
[04:08:53] <Foxboron> was the package incorrect?

[04:15:48] <matthewcroughan> grawlinson: okay so the change is quite minor. The user needs to be informed that they need to start the service when package installation completes, and the sandbox needs to be disabled by default.
[04:16:28] <matthewcroughan> given these two things, it is fine. But if the user has already installed the `nix` package and has decided to do `sudo nix-shell -p hello` for example, they have muddied their system with state that can't be undone by pacman.

[13:15:40] <iGNUrante> Hi all, can anyone help me on explaining me why should I configure DHCP IP subnets if is a DHCP server who decide that? I mean, I am on a laptop and I am trying to connect to a wifi network which I don't know what subnet the DHCP server will share to me. So.. I was expecting to configure wpa_supplicant and dhcp would work, as it works is all other distros without this kind of configuration where someone
[13:15:42] <iGNUrante> need to know what doesn't need to know ( because is the DHCP server "who" decides that.

[21:55:24] <Postaron> I have uninstalled pulseaudio and put pipewire instead and its pipewire-pulse interface. I also have a sennheiser momentum wireless 3 headset, I tried to connect it via bluetooth to my PC, it connects. The problem is that it ONLY has HSF/HSD profiles, no A2DP profile for HD audio quality. I've looked at the arch wikis and pipewire config, nothing works. Someone suggested the solution of
[21:55:26] <Postaron> disabling the mic except that there is no indication or anything that allows me to disable it under pipewire/pipewire-pulse... There you go, problem exposed. Sniff.
