[00:08:07] <AbleBacon> C# / WPF / XAML: you know how when you click on a "TextBox" element it goes into "edit" mode, gives you a cursor, and lets you type into it? how do i enter that mode via a *button* instead?
[00:08:36] <AbleBacon> my "TextBox" is not hit-testable, so it can't be clicked directly
[00:09:03] <bomb> focus
[00:09:49] *** Joins: Mechanismus (~LabMonkey@206.255.106.67)
[00:10:03] <bomb> ugh, make an invisible "back buffer" TextBox, then bind its value to the unclickable TextBox
[00:10:48] <AbleBacon> oooooof that seems like a pretty nasty hack, doesn't it?
[00:11:30] <AbleBacon> i can make the TextBox hit-testable temporarily if needed... it just can't be hit-testable when any drag-and-drop is occuring because it will crash my program
[00:11:57] <AbleBacon> but so when it has "focus" it's in the "edit mode" i was referring to?
[00:12:02] <bomb> oh wait your TextBox isn't disabled, it just doesn't respond to the click event?
[00:12:34] <bomb> yeah, myTextBox.Focus(); would do

[00:16:50] <AbleBacon> is there an event for focus being lost? i want to make it hit-testable while it's focused so that the user can click to move the cursor within the text for editing
[00:17:03] <AbleBacon> so i need to be able to turn hit testing back off once it's done being in focus
[00:18:00] <AbleBacon> OH nvm found it

[00:18:10] <AbleBacon> was looking in the wrong place so i wasn't seeing it

[00:43:59] <entropygain> going to implement a separate auth service in the middle of the one we use like for example okta .. is this a horrible idea?
[00:45:06] <entropygain> as in okta will be the idp but ill take the claims they send over create our own user data that will be upserted with every sso sign in from okta .. then issue new tokens etc from auth service .. this way all our other services need to just learn to code against the auth service and if we decide to change okta down the line i only have to change 1 auth service which basically evolves on it's own ..
[00:45:23] <entropygain> is this bad idea bad practice don't do it!?

[09:15:56] <moose> I have been bashing DNS lately and found so many libraries that are bad for C#
[09:16:17] <sysRPL> you can run any control / window with its own different theme
[09:16:21] <moose> DnsClient.Net is just trash, non-conforming and bad. Returns strings with full qualified indicator at the end instead of the actual wire data.
[09:17:10] <moose> So you can trick it by responding with a DNS answer that has a dot at the end and it will return it as fully qualified. You can trick its authority checking this way and redirect DNS for any client using it. :p

[12:46:00] <MizMahem> now I stuck pondering what is the best way/how do I want to implement this. With the static abstract structs I can force implementers to implement the method. But since my interface already demands an implementation of IComparable, I could just use static methods in my interface that reference that implementation, which should always be correct.
[12:47:11] <MizMahem> But now, since I'm stupid I'm also kind of worried about like "wait, this is the correct implementation, but a child could override this I think and do something stupid? I probably don't want that." But OTOH, I mean, there really isn't any way for me to prevent a child from doing something stupid if they want to, so that's a fools game to try and win.

[13:37:05] <Kukies> Heya, I'm trying to do a out-of-process COM server in .NET core which apparently is possible but not directly supported... and found a official sample on how to do it from MS, but I really can't understand the whole code and exactly what is required, could someone provide some assistance perhaps? The official article is here:
[13:37:05] <Kukies> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/dotnet/samples/out-of-process-com-server/
[13:38:29] <Kukies> In my case I am not defining a new COM interface rather just creating an implementation for the existing interface, so I'm not sure if the IDL file is still needed or not for example.

[17:17:54] <ike43> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALM4UIqBu-Y
[17:18:15] <ike43> where the mods or whoever encourages other users to conduct psycological abuse

[17:19:13] <ike43> encouraging others to be like "yeah, i think they should be banned too! just because i want to be part of the pile-on"
[17:19:48] <ike43> i hope this impacts the abhorent IRC culture of doxing and targeted and systematic harrasment of certain users
[17:20:11] <MatthiasVance> ike43: When you talking about "the new bill" it's unclear what country your context is
[17:20:21] <ike43> the video linked explains all
[17:20:40] <MatthiasVance> I hate watching slow videos :P
[17:20:44] <ike43> but it applies to the UK - its unclear how they would police trolls from the US though
[17:20:47] <MatthiasVance> ah
[17:21:05] <ike43> all the mods suddenly vpn to calafornia
[17:21:34] <ike43> i cant see how these abuses of moderator privileges have become so commonplace
[17:22:11] <ike43> there was even a mod the other day on one of the IRC channels boasting about how they would instaban anyone that was disgruntled at this kind of injust treatment
[17:22:21] <ike43> they called it a "sour grapes attitude"
[17:22:53] <ike43> and they also claimed to ban anyone immidiately that demonstrated "any sense of entitlement" though it was completely unclear what they meant by this
[17:23:19] <ike43> any efforts taken to enquire were retaliated against with severity, absolutely awful behaviour to see from a mod
[17:24:25] <ike43> complaints sent to the admin board to get the mod in check resulted in them banning from the complaints channel!
[17:24:41] <ike43> complete abuse of power
[17:25:50] <ike43> and the channel is for a comunity that is quite new and fragile, to see toxic internet culture running amok is really concerning, since it threatens the safety of the entire IRC channel, basically making it a horrible place to chat, and stifling the comunity
[17:26:46] <ike43> they were also systematically gauding users into falling foul of their absurd and seemingly improvised code of conduct
[17:27:02] <ike43> proviking them into complaining which was considered a banable offence
[17:27:30] <ike43> its like some kind of facist state! only on IRC could such abuses continue unchecked
[17:27:35] <interop_madness> i think pile-ons should be criminalized, especially those on twitter and I advocate for prison without parole for those who are part of these pile-ons
[17:28:06] <interop_madness> it should be in everybody's ability to check whether several people have already unloaded on a person before posting
[17:28:17] <ike43> they literally have been, though i must push back at the idea of prison without parole...
[17:28:56] <interop_madness> these pile-ons, especially on twitter, cost personal health and livelihoods and putting people into prison for that and let them do ACTUAL hard time is not too much to ask for effectively committing social and societal murder
[17:28:59] <ike43> interop_madness: usually that just encourages more people to follow suit and join in though
[17:29:37] <ike43> sure, your right, the psycological harms facilitated by online coms *do* constitute violent crime
[17:29:42] <interop_madness> i'm also for prison without parole on murder and i reject ANY notion that puts social media pile ons against individuals in any category considerably better than murder
[17:30:18] <ike43> its as if violent criminals last place of uninhibited activity is on these literally unpoliced online environments
[17:30:19] <interop_madness> arguably, it can be worse than murder for those who want to die after having experienced a harassment campaign but are inhibited to kill them selves due to survival instinct
[17:30:32] <interop_madness> so yeah, same as torture or murder. let the punishment fit the crime
[17:31:03] <interop_madness> also, on a more petty note, i want the twitterati mob harassers to be just locked into a cell with actual murderers
[17:31:07] <ike43> lol, tell that to these psycotic mods on #haskell - they are making the community unsafe
[17:31:41] <interop_madness> some politician steps up and campaigns on brutally prosecuting those people - he or she has my vote, and yes, that's single issue voting.
[17:31:49] <ike43> interop_madness: that seems quite violent, i cannot condone this
[17:32:00] <ike43> i just want them not to be mods!
[17:32:35] <interop_madness> i have seen enough people be ruined, put out of a job, and, in some cases, harassed into suicide to conclude that long, hard time is the only way to go with these abusers
[17:33:30] <ike43> i would hope the criminalization of the conduct they routinely conduct would at least make them reasess if they should mod like that, im sure they know its wrong, and do it just because they can, maybe the idea that they might not have free reign just bec ause they have moderator privilages could give them some kind of reality check or wake up call
[17:33:34] <interop_madness> this is merely a case of "fuck around and find out" to me. and my stance is society should provide the "find out" part to those people
[17:33:58] <interop_madness> also, the punishment should be proportional to the number of followers you expose a person to
[17:34:00] <ike43> right, but your condoning a violent policing
[17:34:27] <ike43> we should be able to effect change without resorting to threats of harm
[17:35:20] <interop_madness> every imprisonment is an act of violence, yes
[17:35:26] <ike43> its a shame these same persons are not able to see this thread, and that it cant be taken to their thread by me, since they banned me for complaining about their injust actions
[17:35:51] <ike43> interop_madness: i mean, the injustice conducted by the legal justice system is far beyond that conducted on IRC
[17:36:26] <interop_madness> I wasn't talking about IRC specifically
[17:36:30] <ike43> the worst thing i think they do is deliberately misconstrue people when there is the chance of an ambiguous interpretion
[17:36:48] <ike43> interop_madness: yeah, i guess twitter might be more of a serious issue, your right
[17:36:58] <interop_madness> I was talking about righteous outrage mobs who drag people for not behaving in a way compliant to their world view
[17:37:02] <ike43> especially if blacklisting or jobloss occurs
[17:37:09] <ike43> which is a real risk
[17:37:25] <interop_madness> yes, and I am advocating for "excessive" punishment in that case
[17:37:46] <ike43> interop_madness: the real danger is that they are promoted algorithmically and protected by a corrupted justice system at every level
[17:37:47] <interop_madness> it is a duty for everybody to check if a lot of people were already calling out an individual for posting
[17:38:26] <interop_madness> the (AFAIK) latest one is the "let's go brandon" pilot
[17:38:36] <ike43> well, when i was banned yeasterday, people only started saying abusive things after the mod had kind of made it seem like they would be supported in doing so
[17:38:57] <ike43> im not aware of that, do you have a link?
[17:39:09] <interop_madness> some idiot wanted the whole cabin crew fired because they should have dragged the pilot out of cockpit because he was not "fit to fly" (apparently you have to be insane to say "fuck joe biden")
[17:39:24] <ike43> i dont think its ever really a good idea to escalate with more and more extreeme threats!
[17:39:33] <interop_madness> https://www.npr.org/2021/11/01/1051074812/lets-go-brandon-southwest-pilot
[17:39:40] <ike43> but at least, remove them from the positions of power they use to wage their abuse
[17:40:13] <ike43> just dismiss the corrupt cops, judges, mods etc, and ensure the culture is aware that anti-corrpution is a progresive absolute priority
[17:40:20] <interop_madness> I think the pilot should have been talked to by corporate, maybe even get written up (actually, that's even a bit too far for me), but firing him? no.
[17:40:34] <bomb> ike43 does that thing apply to online "lynch culture"? like, this Twitter user is blabla, let's bully him/her to death?
[17:41:27] <ike43> idk, im not an expert, just a "troll" that was banned after having been slandered as a troll, to wake up the next day and find this form of smearing had just that day been made actually illigal!
[17:41:44] <ike43> but i guess it seems to opperate in the same way as a lynch mob, sure
[17:42:21] <ike43> interop_madness: sure, just to ensure the abusive conduct did not persist, would be sufficent
[17:42:47] <ike43> the problem is the justice system reaches for high impact by making an example of people, which is itself a form of injustice we should seek to curtail
[17:43:11] <interop_madness> yeah, he might be a valuable pilot. just tell him to cut the shit, next time it's a write up, and move on. there was LITERALLY no harm done here
[17:43:28] <ike43> its especially difficult to see if someone had been tricked by other users into using phrases with these kind of violent connotations or double meanings
[17:43:47] <interop_madness> and "fuck joe biden" is not even "divisive" as NPR claims, that's probably a majority opinion shared across political aisles
[17:44:07] <ike43> in which case they might be *literally* unaware they were tauting the violent speech of the far right or whatever
[17:44:35] <interop_madness> it's not violent to reject the incubent president with expletives
[17:44:38] <interop_madness> it's free speech
[17:44:41] <bomb> cancel culture is fascism no matter what political view they think they have
[17:44:59] <ike43> i wouldnt feel comfortable to put my life in the hands of a piolot that even shouted "yee haa" as they took off, never mind "fuck joe biden" or words to that effect. very disconcerting
[17:44:59] <interop_madness> i think the worst bottom feeding scum are those who claim "cancel culture doesn't exist"
[17:45:15] <interop_madness> like literally, not even granting the victims the victimhood
[17:45:37] <ike43> yeah, this mod implied that was "an attitude of entitlement"

[17:48:49] <ike43> i think the fact the conduct has been made actually illigal might at least help dissuade these traditions though
[17:49:07] <ike43> i just wish for something better for a language i love

[17:49:33] <bomb> I don't know what happened, but your best bet would be brining that up to haskell mailing list

[17:49:56] <bomb> all those "official" IRC mods actually have bosses
[17:50:07] <interop_madness> I agree that banning someone should only be done in extreme circumstances
[17:50:38] <interop_madness> I also think that for platforms with sufficient reach, it should be outright illegal. in general.
[17:50:56] <ike43> they have systematically banned me, basically using the fact that they do so to justify doing so
[17:51:03] <ike43> "well you get banned so much" ... ban

[17:52:08] <ike43> i even started the chat by saying i was in recovery
[17:52:27] <ike43> since the day previously there had been a similar pile on
[17:52:31] <interop_madness> being deprived of valued social interaction for unjust reasons is hurtful

[17:52:39] <ike43> this, obviously, did not work
[17:52:47] <ike43> and i suspect could even have had the opposite effect
[17:52:56] <khanred> You can't regulate people into being your friends

[17:55:33] <ike43> and then when you explain again, they say "they keep spamming the same thing over and over"
[17:55:45] <ike43> its like some entrapment scheme, its foul
[17:55:58] <ike43> "we have had this problem with you in the past"
[17:56:24] <ike43> you mean you gauded me into exasperation before...
[17:56:43] <ike43> thats a constant on the part of the antagonist, to be antagonistic
[17:56:55] <ike43> not a constant of the "troll" to be too easily provoked
[17:57:15] <ike43> i literally have medically recognised ptsd, i cant put up with these manipulative forms of violence
[17:57:28] <ike43> so i ask them to stop being abusive, and they ban me
[17:57:41] <ike43> as if the accusation could have reprecussions for them, so must be silenced
[17:58:34] <interop_madness> khanred, limited to "one guy on IRC scope", I agree. but given the fact that people have lost their livelihoods over twitter mobs, for no egregious wrongdoing either, yeah, there should be an additional law. and that law should impose actual prison.
[17:58:43] <ike43> i only feel slightly reasured that the issue has made it into UK law
[17:59:03] <ike43> id just like to be able to use IRC without risking people using it as an avenue to harm me
[17:59:22] <khanred> interop_madness, This law is what the political correctness twitter mob wants though
[17:59:28] <interop_madness> publicly shaming a person for millions to see and guilt tripping their employer into firing them should mean, oh, north of 10 years without parole as mandatory minimum.
[17:59:46] <ike43> yeah, its life destroying stuff for sure
[17:59:57] <interop_madness> khanred, no, this law is what ends them, because they thrive on guilt tripping and shaming
[17:59:57] <ike43> stealth harms or something
[18:00:25] <ike43> they have to use loopholes to conduct these targeted harassment campains - its good to see the justice system responding
[18:00:26] <interop_madness> and I'm actually being serious about the 10 yrs mandatory minimum part
[18:00:36] <interop_madness> I would IMMEDIATELY vote for a guy who campaigns on this
[18:00:49] <khanred> They'll ban IRC soon enough
[18:00:57] <interop_madness> probably
[18:01:04] <interop_madness> too unfettered speech for comfort
[18:01:20] <ike43> khanred: they get bolstered by the mob they promote - they think its ok. it being illigal should really help convince them otherwise
[18:01:25] <khanred> interop_madness, and you're in favor of this?
[18:01:38] <bomb> it can't be enforced on IRC, though. we need a cultural change
[18:01:50] <interop_madness> no, I'm for free speech, with the "yelling fire in a theater" exceptions
[18:02:01] <ike43> he seems to be being a bit overzealous to the point where id suspect its playing devils advocate
[18:02:03] <interop_madness> and my point is, orchestrating online mobs is such an exception as well
[18:02:29] <ike43> im a total passifist so i cant condone the actual enforcement, only the message the law sends
[18:02:55] <ike43> i think they act because they beleive they are doing the thing that is most supported by tradition
[18:03:10] <interop_madness> it is my view that the typical twitter harasser only understands strength and being hit where it hurts
[18:03:14] <ike43> i dont think they would need to fear enforcement, simply to understand the traditions are discouraged
[18:03:42] <ike43> they think everyones doing this
[18:03:50] <interop_madness> also, as far as it's "a lot of people against one individual", there can't even be overzealous punishment, in my view
[18:03:54] <bomb> some programming languages are loosely tied to academia, where mobbing is still a norm
[18:04:01] <ike43> that everyone, at least notionally, supports this. they dont. the reform is in process

[18:04:59] <ike43> its more or less *how* they teach
[18:05:10] <ike43> they *provoke* you towards engagement
[18:05:13] <ike43> its awful

[18:08:10] <bomb> ike43 yeah I've spent 13 years in academia. it's terrible
[18:08:16] <ike43> the way they teach is to provide tautological explanations, and see if the student can figure it out anyway
[18:08:30] <bomb> maybe even more so than military, I'm curious
[18:08:59] <ike43> i was asking what "monads as effects" meant, and they were like, "oh, its about nondetermanism" and tried to rope me into some wild goose chace trying to understand that concept aswell
[18:09:26] <ike43> by the end of it, i understood exactly what the nondetermanism thing was about, but was no close to answering my original question
[18:09:40] <ike43> the whole of maths is set up like that
[18:09:53] <ike43> just a huge tautological model construction
[18:09:59] <ike43> which people ascribe meaning too
[18:10:37] <ike43> whats a "such and such", oh its just a "thingamagig", oh whats that? well its most easily understood by appealing to the yoneda lemma (another common tautology)
[18:10:52] <ike43> and the people that get this have a great time basically wasting peoples lives away

[18:18:15] <Shariff> One can always choose to use another platform, it's not like there is no other option.
[18:18:22] <interop_madness> wrong.
[18:18:33] <Shariff> Quite eloquent :)
[18:18:38] <khanred> literally the truth lol
[18:18:47] <khanred> there are plenty of alternatives
[18:18:49] <bomb> interop_madness pretty much anathema
[18:18:53] <interop_madness> if a platform has a quasi monopoly on social interaction, there is not "an alternative to it"
[18:19:02] <interop_madness> all friends are there and nowhere else
[18:19:09] <Shariff> It's the quasi that does it :)
[18:19:22] <interop_madness> because actual monopoly means cornering the market

[18:19:53] <interop_madness> sure but that's unusual in these days and you should not be forced to have to resort to that
[18:20:10] <interop_madness> also it does not tend to have the same networking characteristic
[18:20:17] <Shariff> So a private company should no longer have a say in who uses their platform?
[18:20:43] <interop_madness> once they have a sufficiently high market share, no. they should not have a say. correct.

[18:26:31] <ike43> if it results in jobloss for example
[18:26:57] <ike43> got banned from twitter, worked at a newspaper, lost job
[18:27:10] <ike43> got doxed by mods, mobbed at place of residence

[18:27:31] <interop_madness> yeah, people only think it's hurtful when the victims literally kill themselves, not before
[18:27:53] <interop_madness> it is fucking hard to admit defeat, to admit publicly that the mob has rattled you and you are in therapy

[18:28:41] <ike43> "your seeling out to the corporation" - "theyr trying to kill me, im trying to kick up some chaff"
[18:28:51] <ike43> still gets offed
[18:28:52] <Shariff> interop_madness: why would that be hard? The idea that the brain is the only organ that never 'breaks' is crazy :P
[18:29:18] <ike43> its like people havent seen westworld!
[18:29:22] <interop_madness> because people misconstrue that as playing the victim
[18:29:35] <ike43> social media is *enforced*
[18:29:46] <ike43> we are siloed
[18:29:55] <ike43> it *is* a lifeline
[18:29:58] <ike43> literally
[18:30:16] <Shariff> See.. skewed sense of reality :D
[18:30:22] <ike43> so you grew up without a smartphone - that doesnt mean it isnt real for other people
[18:30:30] <interop_madness> this.
[18:30:40] <ike43> Shariff: diminishing the reality of the problem isnt helping mate
[18:30:44] <Shariff> ike43: It is real for me too.. I'm looking at it.. I tossed it.. it's real :)
[18:30:47] <interop_madness> younger people literally grew up with this as a PRIMARY means of social interaction
[18:31:05] <interop_madness> deplatforming them means 100% long term therapy necessary
[18:31:05] <Shariff> ike43: how am I diminishing the problem?
[18:31:23] <ike43> your saying my *real* world view is somehow *unreal*
[18:31:31] <ike43> "skewed" apparently.
[18:31:32] <Shariff> smartphone != social media :D
[18:31:54] <ike43> see, your making side arguments to diminish
[18:31:58] <Shariff> ike43: If you see people discussing mental health as playing the victim, then yes :)
[18:32:20] <Shariff> O_O
[18:32:31] <ike43> your now implying holding a view opposite to that held
[18:32:39] <ike43> dont mistonstrue my stance. please
[18:32:50] <ike43> i certainly dont see the world the way you imply
[18:33:05] <ike43> perhaps that wasnt your intended implication. please take care
[18:33:06] <Shariff> ok.. somehow what I'm saing is coming over differently then what I mean to see, I think
[18:33:17] <ike43> ok, lets start over
[18:33:25] <ike43> i appologise
[18:33:27] <ike43> anyway...
[18:33:42] <_genuser_> guys I think my internets are not working.
[18:33:49] <_genuser_> I'm seeing someone apologize online in a chat....
[18:33:58] <ike43> fuck you asshole, this is the future!
[18:33:59] <Shariff> Let me rephrase: I meant to say that people who think that talking about (their) mental health is playing the victim is a skewed sense of reality :)
[18:34:07] <Shariff> I never meant to imply that is your position :)
[18:34:11] <_genuser_> ike43 lol that went out of control fast!
[18:34:26] <ike43> 0 tolerance policy for the sake of irony
[18:34:44] <ike43> systematic unambiguous explanation for the sake of TRUE
[18:34:55] <_genuser_> well, I thought it was a big of you to apologize. and I wanted to point it out.
[18:35:00] <_genuser_> not to insult you. but oh well. smh.
[18:35:04] <Shariff> I am happy you did say something, ike43.. otherwise I didn't know what I was saying didn't come over as I intended
[18:35:14] <ike43> Sharriff: i agree entierly, that was what i was saying to begin with
[18:35:27] <ike43> okok, enough already
[18:35:46] <Shariff> I also appologize if I said it wrong. I am autistic and sometimes I say things in a way that people cannot 'translate' my meaning :)
[18:35:53] <Shariff> ok :)
[18:36:04] <interop_madness> Shariff, it's not often a skewed sense of reality, it's often malicious: 1. online mobs unleashes on person 2. person goes incommunicado and later opens up on how they had to see a therapist due to the abuse 3. abusers say "see, now she is playing the victim"
[18:36:19] <_genuser_> so Shariff is also apologizing. now it just really looks wrong. people apologizing in a chat
[18:37:43] <Shariff> Thinking that acting maliciously is ok is in my book still a skewed sense of reality. THinking that one is anonymous, because one uses an alias merely says they don't understand the tech, imho
[18:38:12] <Shariff> And in that case, It is still not playing the victim. But it must be difficult for people to be confronted by the consequences of their actions
[18:38:15] <interop_madness> ok, in that broadened sense I agree
[18:38:34] <interop_madness> well "consequences of actions" is such a buzz phrase
[18:38:47] <interop_madness> are the consequences proportionate to the actions?
[18:38:56] <Shariff> Seeing the result of what they did? is that better
[18:39:14] <interop_madness> "consequences to action" can also be a tyranny cracking down on dissidents, otherwise
[18:39:26] <Shariff> Is that what we are discussing?
[18:39:57] <interop_madness> "consequences of actions" is just a kind of taxonomic escape into vague territory
[18:40:04] <Shariff> Not for me
[18:40:29] <Shariff> If someone bullies someone into attempted suicide.. that is a consequence of the actions of the bully (not just)
[18:40:42] <bomb> you can immediately get banned from #arch by using the magic word "installer"
[18:40:57] <Shariff> If someone is bullied and that leads to self image problems, and one is confronted with the fact that one needed help to deal with that.. must be so touch on the bully :P
[18:40:57] <interop_madness> yes, but "actions have consequences" is what online mobs use to justify and sugar coat their abuse
[18:41:00] <bomb> or try "systemd" in #gentoo
[18:41:06] <interop_madness> "it's not cancel culture. it's consequence culture"
[18:41:22] <Shariff> That is not my position
[18:42:05] <Shariff> Are you stuck on those words I chose? Or the message?
[18:42:56] <interop_madness> maybe I misunderstood
[18:43:06] <interop_madness> you seem to have meant the other way around
[18:43:33] <bomb> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/why-latest-campus-cancellation-different/620352/
[18:43:49] <interop_madness> consequences = the damage bullies incur, actions = the bullying. I at first understood: someone talking bs = action, mob ruining their life = consequence
[18:44:17] <interop_madness> I jumped to that conclusion, because, as stated above, that's how the mobs often (verbatim) sugarcoat their abuse
[18:44:27] <Shariff> Yes that is my position.. :)
[18:44:39] <Shariff> consequence is the damage incurred

[18:49:06] <brianonymous_> is it really a matter of action vs consequence.. or a matter of a mismatch of scale of the consequence against the action. or is a balance irrelevant?
[18:49:11] <interop_madness> people who claim cancel culture doesn't exist are outright liars
[18:49:47] <interop_madness> yeah, I can think of very few things a person can to to be permanently deleted from society
[18:49:55] <interop_madness> to justify to...
[18:50:19] <interop_madness> even murderers can go on parole, that's one of the goals of prison anyway
[18:51:10] <bomb> interop_madness I disabled Twitter on my computer. what does that Tweet say?
[18:51:28] <MizMahem> I don't really see a difference between "Goverment imposed consequences for violating the 'norms of society'" and "Mob imposed consequences for violating the 'norms of society.'" Except, you know, that the Goverment has like rules and policies and procedures it follows to make sure consequences are applied according to some standard of fairness and justice, rather than just the arbitrary rules of the crowd.

[18:52:57] <interop_madness> I would go as far as saying ochlocracy is arguably the most savage, barbaric form of tyranny, because it's decentralized
[18:53:16] <interop_madness> and it needs a lot of people willing to do it
[18:53:19] <MizMahem> I think you also can't just abdicate your feelings about society should be structured by throwing it away to the will of the mob and "actions have consequences." If this is what you think, if you think "If you believe certain things, you should not be allowed to speak on penalty of losing your job and right to speak on public platforms" is the way society should be structured, well then, have the balls to put that beliefs into practtice.
[18:53:39] <MizMahem> Like, write your congress(person) and get the laws changed so what you want is the rules.
[18:53:47] <bomb> interop_madness wowza

[18:55:02] <MizMahem> If you think the "consequences" of having a "bad belief" is getting fired, well, I mean, we can make that a law. That is usually how we apply consequences in society. We make laws and have the government enforce them.

[19:14:16] * bomb leaves the room silently.
[19:14:22] <dan01> About INotifyPropertyChanged, you guys rightly pointed out before, it has nothing to do, per see, with MVVM, it's part of the standard library
[19:14:40] <dan01> However, where do you implement it, on the model or on the view-model?
[19:14:40] <bomb> yeah, it's about binding
[19:14:57] *** Joins: liefer (~liefer@user/liefer)
[19:15:08] <bomb> if it's about data (hint: it is), it belongs to the model
[19:15:14] <dan01> My guess it the model
[19:15:23] <bomb> correct
[19:15:33] <dan01> bomb: right, cause you want it to notify the viewmodel that then triggers the view, right
[19:15:35] <dan01> ?
[19:15:37] <dan01> ok
[19:15:40] <dan01> Nice!
[19:15:54] <dan01> Then 2 years of working in a company have been a lie, lol
[19:16:03] <dan01> We did it in the ViewModel at work
[19:16:19] <dan01> But then I started looking at MVVM, didn't looked right :))
[19:16:57] <dan01> Well, will do it better next time, lol

[19:26:07] <MizMahem> dan01: you implement INPC on the *ViewModel* not the Model, usually.
[19:26:35] <interop_madness> ^
[19:26:50] <interop_madness> the view reacts to change notifications from the ViewModel
[19:27:26] <interop_madness> this is what makes the databindings work to begin with
[19:27:26] <MizMahem> also, important note, you only need to implement INPC when your ViewModel has an object that changes underneath the View. That is, something happened in the ViewModel or Model that requires the View's state to be updated.
[19:27:43] <Shariff> When you're making a database project with POCO classes.. does it make sense to use class hierarchies? LIke Film is a generalization for TvShowEpisode and Movie?
[19:27:47] <MizMahem> You do *not* have to implement it to have the View notify the model that something has changed. A simply binding does that.
[19:27:57] *** Joins: Haxxa (~Haxxa@122.199.46.64)
[19:28:02] <MatthiasVance> okay
[19:29:03] <MizMahem> Normally in MVVM the Model does not change outside of the VM's notice. But if it was to for some reason, then yeah, you might implement INPC on it.
[19:29:18] <MizMahem> and have the VM itself subscribe to those events.
[19:29:58] <MizMahem> and then bubble up the the view as appropriate.

[19:44:20] <MatthiasVance> (kind of)
[19:44:21] <ike43> like, government cannot contend with them, or regulate them, or rule against them, or anything
[19:44:28] <ike43> just like they couldnt regulate banking
[19:44:33] <ike43> because its how they implement control
[19:44:36] <redoc> ike43, lobbyists.
[19:44:37] <ike43> !!
[19:44:38] <MatthiasVance> So I pump it a few times, it fills up the red thingy, air valve is closed of course, and then once that red thingy is drained it stops
[19:44:38] <brianonymous_> MatthiasVance: oh, one of those.. is the valve shut?
[19:44:42] <MatthiasVance> Yes!
[19:44:46] <brianonymous_> lol, sorry
[19:44:47] <MatthiasVance> But maybe it's faulty?
[19:44:53] <brianonymous_> prime it with water first and try it
[19:44:59] <ike43> i mean, now we have direct control to intervene with individuals based on targeting algos
[19:45:10] <ike43> dont need stock market interventions to implement societal control
[19:45:23] <ike43> because the state department was in bed with wall street
[19:45:27] <edcba> oh i have the same model of pump but never used it
[19:45:31] <ike43> american companies implementing globalism
[19:45:37] <brianonymous_> we use those over here for kerosene transfer
[19:45:43] <edcba> yeah same
[19:45:44] <ike43> but now just have smartphones beeping us this way and that
[19:46:02] <ike43> so the role of capitalism and its protected status as a control weapon
[19:46:02] <MatthiasVance> brianonymous_: Which part? That's what 4-5 times pumping does, right
[19:46:09] <brianonymous_> MatthiasVance: i would think
[19:46:11] <ike43> so finally we can regulat banking and automated trading
[19:46:15] <ike43> makes sense?
[19:46:32] <ike43> smartphone controls > market based controls
[19:46:41] <ike43> social media companies > wall st
[19:46:43] <MatthiasVance> brianonymous_: Yeah so I'm back to manual pumping then :(
[19:46:53] <ike43> so now its facebook that is too big to fail, not banking
[19:47:05] <edcba> well because now every banking institution requires you to have a smartphone
[19:47:29] <ike43> like, because the pentagon implements control via direct controls on individuals instead of at the consumer level
[19:47:40] <MatthiasVance> brianonymous_: AHHH
[19:47:49] <brianonymous_> MatthiasVance: ?
[19:47:50] <MatthiasVance> brianonymous_: I tightened everything REALLY tight
[19:47:53] <MatthiasVance> So it was an air issue somewhere
[19:47:55] <MatthiasVance> :)
[19:47:55] <brianonymous_> oh nice
[19:47:56] <ike43> ie, the pentagon wont defend wall street as its frontline weapon
[19:47:56] <MatthiasVance> working now!
[19:47:59] <brianonymous_> \o/
[19:48:31] <edcba> next time use a simple tube and your mouth :p Less failure modes
[19:48:46] <brianonymous_> thats actually what i though he had at first
[19:48:52] <edcba> well there is one small disadvantage though...
[19:49:00] <ike43> can anyone understand this argument?
[19:50:47] <brianonymous_> any system is corruptible given enough time for people to locate the loopholes. the only dif is the currency of the corruption (money/power) and its enforcements
[19:50:56] <brianonymous_> the fail point is always the people
[19:51:03] <MatthiasVance> edcba: Putting the tube in the tank is a bit fidgety
[19:51:09] <MatthiasVance> So I wouldn't have enough time :P
[19:51:16] <MatthiasVance> Or I could hold my finger on it I guess
[19:51:55] <MatthiasVance> I just couldn't imagine the thing being faulty at first xD Questioning science instead of the siphon

[19:59:27] <ike43> they were doing globalism via liberal trade and deregulated finance

[20:35:55] <redoc> trying to do a small test app to get on the google play store. what a PITA
[20:37:25] <Nasp> So we had a long long long talk at work about access control and VPN
[20:37:35] <Nasp> Right now we require VPN for more and more stuff, even for our customer service
[20:37:52] <Nasp> And i argued that isn't it better to use login in front of services instead of always requiring VPN
[20:37:59] <Nasp> Since the more people that are on VPN the less secure it is
[20:38:20] <AbleBacon> ugh. so i added drag-and-drop to reorder things in a list... but now it's causing a huge memory leak that's (i guess) remembering old instances of objects from before they were moved

[20:58:46] <AbleBacon> but i have to store that prepared connection data somewhere and tell C which instance of data to use

[21:01:23] <ike43> thats why *social media* is a new form of power
[21:01:47] <ike43> because it exists in a way that uses personal data to personalize interventions algorithmically

[21:02:30] <ike43> so the *cant* regulate *their controls*
[21:02:48] <ike43> the social media companies, like the wall street, is aligned with the state department
[21:03:00] <ike43> as the actuators of intervention to control society
[21:03:09] <ike43> they are above regulation as they serve miltary ends
[21:03:31] <ike43> it would be like trying to regulate the army because they kill people
[21:03:54] <ike43> the harms caused by wall street aree forgiven because of the utility they have in projecting power
[21:04:04] <ike43> similarly, social media firms are above regulation
[21:04:18] <ike43> but now, with the more direct controls, maybe they can reign in roughe finance for the first time
[21:05:15] <ike43> thats the point im trying to make, does that make sense?
[21:06:21] <ike43> traditional/legacy media wasnt personalized. it was a blunt force tool
[21:06:35] <ike43> algorithmic control could *only* be implemented via markets before

[22:59:17] <JakeSays> LOL
[23:00:36] <bomb> MatthiasVance pfff they not talking about Celsius, all those numbers are in Kelvin
[23:00:55] <MatthiasVance> Kelvin also likes 40 max
[23:01:26] <bomb> 64 Kelvin is fairly cool, I'd say.
[23:01:58] <brianonymous_> as a bonus side effect, you could start selling liquid oxygen
[23:03:21] <bomb> with alcohol ice cubes
[23:03:44] <bomb> tasty
[23:03:52] <brianonymous_> should be pretty safe around fire

[23:11:10] <JakeSays> yup

[23:19:41] <bomb> NL was the closes when weed was legal only in NL
[23:20:57] <bomb> moreover, the govt. would provide free needles, so junkies don't get HIV or something by sharing a single needle XD
[23:22:33] <ike43> why not give them pipes instead!?
[23:22:44] <ike43> instead of encouraging IV drug use
[23:22:55] <bomb> it's not encouraging
[23:23:22] <ike43> instead of facilitating*
[23:23:32] <bomb> they will inject heroin into their bloodstream either way. better use a clean needle
[23:23:34] <ike43> i mean, i would *encourage* pipe use over iv use
[23:23:42] <ike43> nobody should be injecting, its really bad news
[23:24:07] <bomb> as if it would be an alternative to dope
[23:24:31] <ike43> its easy enough smoked, and way less chance of overdose, infection etc.
[23:24:47] <ike43> its just because needles are cheep they can issue handfulls of them in charity vans
[23:24:51] <JakeSays> usually people who inject are beyond smoking
[23:24:54] <ike43> but they should do that with pipes instead
[23:25:01] <ike43> JakeSays: BS
[23:25:07] <ike43> thats just giving up on people
[23:25:12] <ike43> as if they had no chance to get better
[23:25:21] <ike43> getting off needles is the first step to recovery

[23:25:29] <ike43> what!?
[23:25:32] <JakeSays> go away
[23:25:34] <bomb> why don't you just give them chocolate bars, then

[23:26:18] <JakeSays> ike43: it's more drivel from earlier.
[23:26:30] <ike43> you just want to perpetuate some myth of drug users as needle fiends with HIV
[23:26:40] <ike43> its grotesque pedling of prejudice
[23:26:41] <JakeSays> i dont want to do anything
[23:26:49] <ike43> someone says something proactive and you start lamenting
[23:26:51] <JakeSays> including listening to you
[23:27:01] <ike43> JakeSays: keep it to yourself
[23:27:06] <ike43> your discouraging

[23:27:24] <JakeSays> ike43: sorry dude but your pages long rant from earlier has tainted anything you might say.
[23:27:32] <ike43> why bring that up?
[23:27:34] <JakeSays> you canceled yourself
[23:27:39] <ike43> no, you are now

[23:36:54] <JakeSays> LOL now he's threatening violence.
[23:37:03] <ike43> how is discussing current affairs and discouraging its cancelation "too much effort"
[23:37:12] <ike43> its basically the job of any progressive journalist
[23:37:16] <bomb> you know what's funny. MatthiasVance was angry at me when I tried to stop this guy's trolling a year ago XD
[23:37:18] <ike43> and as that happens to be my job...
[23:37:49] <ike43> JakeSays: wow, such glee, now you have the amo you need
[23:37:50] <bomb> s/at/with/
[23:37:50] <MizMahem> a good troll should aim for like one to two lines to generate many more responses. You've kinda done like the extreme opposite.
[23:37:53] <JakeSays> ike43: hmm. this is a channel for c# DEVELOPER discussions, not progressive journalism discussions.
[23:38:15] <ike43> alright, where do i go to discuss the intersection of feminism and surveylance capitalism
[23:38:24] <gufi_> reddit?
[23:38:27] <MizMahem> twitter?
[23:38:33] <JakeSays> ike43: in other words, know your audience like a real journalist
[23:38:38] <ike43> MizMayhem: doesnt that convince you im *not* a troll!?
[23:38:45] <MizMahem> no
[23:38:46] <gufi_> no
[23:38:49] <JakeSays> no
[23:38:51] <ike43> i dont give a fuck about these dumbasses
[23:38:52] <bomb> ike43 talk about that I'm curious
[23:38:59] <gufi_> god damn it
[23:38:59] <MichaelLong> to be clear, I couldn't follow the earlier ramblings. But I'm probably not up to the topic(s)
[23:39:03] <MizMahem> take lessons from the master here.
[23:39:10] <gufi_> i wonder which troll will explode first...
[23:39:15] <JakeSays> LOL
[23:39:27] <ike43> well im not going to let you gaud me into saying things other than things like this
[23:39:45] <bomb> what does feminism have to do with "surveillance capitalism" whatever the fuck that means
[23:39:49] <JakeSays> ike43: i'm trying to gaud you in to saying nothing.
[23:39:50] <ike43> if you honestly wanted to engage in that discussion you should have chipped in earlier when jake was shitting all over it
[23:40:19] <ike43> simply side with the person being canceled, tell jake to fuck off, and have a conversation without it being stifled by knobends
[23:40:55] <gufi_> damn it suchi...
[23:41:00] <bomb> who is jake?
[23:41:07] <gufi_> you are most of the time
[23:41:08] <JakeSays> ugh. see, the problem with you progressives is, as soon as someone just doesn't want to listen, you scream "i'm canceled".
[23:41:08] <MichaelLong> ok but what when I'm annoyed about the person that is being canceled?
[23:41:13] <ike43> bomb: not until i feel safe to do so without the risk of being derailed - i cant tell if your genuine
[23:41:30] <JakeSays> MichaelLong: doesnt matter.
[23:41:36] <ike43> if you are convinced into joining the mob of cancelers
[23:41:46] <ike43> wtf can i do!?
[23:41:53] <JakeSays> you can shut up
[23:41:54] <bomb> ike43 i can assure you you're safe. it took us days to ban DrIranion for saying racist shit
[23:41:58] <gufi_> imagine finding any one that agreed with you in a irc room based on a way outdated protocol in a C# developer chat rofl
[23:42:02] <ike43> the conversation will only ever be - stop fucking canceling me, until you do
[23:42:08] <bomb> just don't be drama queen
[23:42:11] <JakeSays> gufi_: indeed
[23:42:14] <ike43> im happy to go to the correct channel and bomb can join me there
[23:42:23] <gufi_> you two should probably just dm

[23:43:35] <bomb> gufi stop begging mods to ban a person. you can put him on ignore
[23:43:51] <ike43> so anyway, where is a good place to discuss feminism, if all it does here is encourage people to join a pile on?

[23:48:36] <bomb> but then the chat screen looked a lot like 2007-circa Facebook profile with all kinds of pictures and shit

[23:48:42] <gufi_> being able to post pictures/code without needing links is fucking niiiice
[23:48:52] <bomb> I prefer textual communication
[23:49:02] <gufi_> discord mostly is that...
[23:49:11] <gufi_> ther are voice channels butlike... almost no one uses them
[23:49:20] <MichaelLong> that's ok for my because I don't know any metabook profile stuff of any time.
