[00:12:49] <lok91> Are the floor and ceiling functions even or odd? Or neither?
[00:13:12] <qergle> what the definitions of "even" and "odd" that you have?
[00:13:32] <Z-module> neither
[00:14:16] <Z-module> floor(-1/2) is neither + nor - floor(1/2),   same for ceil()
[00:15:01] <lok91> I wasn't sure if there were some functions which couldn't be classified as even or odd, but according to the definitions, it didn't really seem to fit :P
[00:16:57] <Z-module> every function f:R -> R  (whatsoever, regardless of discontinuties) is a sum of an even function and an odd function in a unique way. When both those summands are not the identically 0 function, then f is neither even nor odd.

[00:24:42] <lok91> Z-module By the way, I never took a course on abstract algebra, but in a calculus textbook, I read something about "algebraic properties of real numbers". They say that you can add them, subtract them, multiply them and divide them - and then, in a bracket, they write "recall that R is a field". Is that the reason you can perform these operations
[00:24:43] <lok91> on them?
[00:25:11] <lok91> I have no idea what it means that "R is a field" (I didn't really understand the Wiki page, when I googled "field")
[00:25:43] <riv> lok91, it just means you have + - * / operations, with certain rules
[00:25:45] <Z-module> You can fiend the axioms for a field online easily
[00:25:52] <Z-module> it's just the basic facts about + and *
[00:25:59] <Z-module> that you're familiar with in R
[00:26:11] <lok91> But not subtraction and division? Only + and *?
[00:26:40] <Z-module> well, a - b is just shorthand for a + (-b)  where -b is the group inverse of b for the operation of addition
[00:27:06] <lok91> Oh, yeah :P
[00:27:28] <Z-module> and a/b is  a * b^-1   where b^-1 is the group inverse of nonzero b for the operation of multiplication
[00:27:51] <Z-module> it's not particularly fruitful to think of subtraction and division as separate operations
[00:27:52] <lok91> So essentially, the fact that R is a field means that you can perform those operations?
[00:27:57] <Z-module> (from addition and multiplication)
[00:32:34] <lok91> But thanks, Z-module!
[00:33:39] <Z-module> I hate that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics) does deal with four separate operations. Icky.
[00:34:49] <lok91> Z-module But luckily, you can edit Wikipedia :D  I'm sure that you can write a very neat page :P

[02:03:45] <xaltsc> Hey, I tend to think of sums (=coproduct) as "smaller" than product because of how they behave in, say, vector spaces over a field. However, whereas we have Tychonov for the product of compact spaces, this trivially does not hold for an (infinite) sum of compact spaces. Is there a categorical reason that makes Top behave differently than algebraic categories ?

[11:01:31] <joel135> Not really helpful (actually, not at all), but: It seems like you can generalize this situation in a certain direction. Let a be a subspace of A, and similarly b of B. In the case of f and g, (a, A) = (b, B) = (pt, circle). The functions f and g are drawn across this circle, in a diagrammatic/'semiotic' sense. Let (c, C) be the *pushout product* of (a, A) and (b, B). The functions f and g can be drawn across c, and commutativity
[11:01:31] <joel135> amounts to the ability to extend this drawing to all of C.

[11:15:04] <joel135> 2^x
[11:15:34] <joel135> x^2 is quadratic growth, x^c is polynomial growth
[11:16:45] <no_gravity> Aha!
[11:17:02] <no_gravity> That is why "exponential growth" is such a popular termn.
[11:17:09] <no_gravity> Say we have a specie that does not die and every individual produces one child every day.
[11:17:15] <no_gravity> It would grow by 2^x where x is nr days.
[11:17:22] <joel135> Yes
[11:17:24] <no_gravity> When is "x^2" a useful tool when thinking about the world?
[11:18:26] <joel135> x^2 is distance fallen when you drop a rock

[11:20:36] <joel135> Right
[11:20:42] <qergle> maybe cubically?
[11:21:52] <no_gravity> joel135: What if speed is linearely correlated to distance?

[13:55:20] <Guest76> At the beginning of Tao's book, Analysis I, he states Peano's axioms, and then says that the axiom of mathematical induction (MI) shouldn't hold for number systems (with N in mind) which contain "unnecessary" elements such as 0.5. He gives a "'proof'" of this by saying: Apply MI to P(n) = n "is not a half-integer" (i.e. an integer plus 0.5), then
[13:55:20] <Guest76> P(0) is true, and if P(n) is true, then P(n++) is true; thus MI asserts that P(n) is true for all n in N. He then says this "proof" isn't genuine since "integer", "half-integer" and "0.5" haven't been defined. Aside from these remarks, does this constitute a valid proof at all? Like, I don't see how they proved that from P(n) follows P(n++) (I can
[13:55:21] <Guest76> see why 0 isn't a half-integer, though.) Or would the unstated inductive step be something like starting from n (isn't a half-integer), and getting its successor, for which we know we're only increasing the "main part" of the number (i.e. there's nothing after the decimal point), so we know this can't be a half-integer, and since this is n++,
[13:55:21] <Guest76> P(n++) is true as well, so this constitutes a proof of some sort?
[13:56:16] <riv> why dont you write n+1 rahter than n++
[13:56:28] <riv> n++ is a bit confusing because of programming
[13:57:13] <Guest76> It just stands for the successor thing. n+1 would mean addition, and that hasn't been introduced yet.
[13:57:19] <riv> oh okay
[13:57:34] <cherim> I'd say the whole quote is confusing, and it's Tao to blame
[13:57:37] <riv> im more used to S(n) for the primitive successor operation that comes before addition
[13:57:46] <riv> yeah tao is notoriously terrible at exposition
[13:57:53] <Guest76> Me too, but I'm following the book.
[13:58:13] <Guest76> He says this proof is just to show why MI was introduced so as to exclude these "unnecessary" numbers.
[13:58:14] <riv> Guest76, but yes the induction sketch is valid
[13:58:26] <riv> sort of
[13:58:35] <riv> it shows that no natural number is a half integer
[13:58:53] <qergle> Guest71: looks ok, other than your RHS error
[13:59:07] <riv> but the question of whether there are extra elements in the set of naturals is actually much deeper and more subtle than "you can just prove there aren't using induction" leads you to believe
[13:59:27] <Guest71> qergle gotcha thanks
[13:59:40] <Guest76> Well, that's true, but he's here proving that 0.5, 1.5, etc. aren't in N.
[14:00:04] <riv> the thing is we alread know this without proving it
[14:00:14] *** Joins: Mattiaslndstrm (~Mattiasln@c188-148-207-108.bredband.tele2.se)
[14:00:23] <riv> because 0.5 is not in N, so it.. cant be in N
[14:00:26] <Guest76> How would we know that? It satisfies the first 4 axioms (the equality ones are presupposed).
[14:00:27] <cherim> You are doing logic/foundations without exact definitions, this has very questionable status

[14:00:34] <cherim> What the hell is 0.5
[14:00:53] <riv> so yeah I would recommend just ignoring this part
[14:00:55] <Guest76> Yeah, that's why he says this is a "proof", in quotes, because those things haven't been defined.
[14:00:57] <riv> it's just a bit silly
[14:01:02] <Guest76> Okay, alright, I'll ignore it.
[14:03:07] <Guest76> I've realized that if numbers like 0.5, 1.5, etc. existed in N, they'd form an isolated loop using the first 4 axioms. And perhaps this would hold for all other "unnecessary" numbers in N, right?
[14:03:29] <Guest76> And by loop I don't mean with a wrap-around, which is prohibited by one of the axioms.
[14:03:30] <cherim> How do you define N?
[14:04:31] <riv> so the 'standard' natural numbers look like this {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ..} but you could relabel them to be like {a, aa, aaa, aaaa, ...} or even {0.5, 1.5, 2.5, ...} these are all valid 'inductive sets'

[17:29:49] <cafkafk> I think it's a bit dismissive to chalk it up to luck
[17:30:21] <riv> niston, center in what sense? the average?
[17:30:34] *** Quits: Bayes8 (~Bayes@user/bayes) (Quit: Connection closed)
[17:30:43] <mornfall> yeah, just take the mean x and y coordinate
[17:31:12] <niston> center in the sense that, if the objects are rotated around the axis going through that center point, they will stay in the same positions relative to each other.
[17:31:15] <theskillwithin> cafkafk im here cuz i find math interesting, even tho i suck at it.  and well i have found u guys are open to existential questions and i like that as well
[17:31:30] <mornfall> niston: that's true of rotation using any axis
[17:31:41] <cafkafk> If you wanna find the "common z axis" it makes my SVD sense tingle, but I can't really remember the specifics
[17:31:56] <niston> normally, the objects rotate around their own Z axis
[17:31:59] <niston> individually
[17:32:10] <mornfall> niston: wait, what objects… you said points
[17:32:15] <mornfall> oh
[17:32:23] <niston> the points describe the object positions in a 2d plane
[17:32:44] <mornfall> well, in any case, rotation around any axis, as long as all objects are rotated using the same axis and same angle, will not change relative positions of the objects
[17:32:55] <mornfall> rotations are rigid
[17:33:05] <niston> hmm dunno how to explain :)
[17:33:08] <cafkafk> theskillwithin: I basically also started programming very early and got a job in web (backend node), but decided to study before I went full career
[17:33:26] <mornfall> you might be looking for center of gravity
[17:33:26] <niston> I can only rotate each object around it's individual Z axis. I can also position them X/Y.
[17:33:53] <niston> so I would like to find an algorithm that lets me rotate them around their common Z axis
[17:34:08] <mornfall> there isn't a ‘common
[17:34:11] <mornfall> Z axis’
[17:34:11] <niston> I already have code to rotate an object around an other point

[17:34:36] <niston> which should be in the middle of all the points? or not? idk
[17:34:44] <niston> which should be in the middle of all the objects? or not? idk
[17:35:01] <mornfall> if you want the motion to be ‘natural’ probably use center of gravity
[17:35:07] <niston> that sounds good
[17:35:11] <niston> how is this computed?
[17:35:39] <mornfall> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass#A_system_of_particles
[17:35:44] <cafkafk> By using the singular value decomposition on the transformation matrix you can find the "principal components", then take the least principle axis (the axis that has the least amount of transformation) and that would be a good way to do a "common axis" to a first approximation
[17:36:12] <cafkafk> In my head at least, dunno if that would be satisfactory in practice
[17:36:47] <mornfall> it's really just weighted average (quite literally weighted :p)

[18:08:37] <[itchyjunk]> you learn set theory, pick up Coq and realize sets is the wrong way to think

[18:08:54] <greenbagels> [itchyjunk]: do you recall this fact from precalculus: if a polynomial with real coefficients has a complex root, it necessarily also has the conjugate root?
[18:09:24] <[itchyjunk]> i do not
[18:09:26] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[18:10:00] <cafkafk> Set theory is still worthwhile for algorithms for instance
[18:10:03] <[itchyjunk]> but he'll cover this topic today so i'll be reminded of all of this soon enough
[18:10:22] <[itchyjunk]> you can implement some algos in terms of set theory
[18:10:29] <[itchyjunk]> but from what i hear, type theory makes more sense?
[18:10:32] <[itchyjunk]> idk how true that is
[18:10:42] <[itchyjunk]> hard to find lot of type theory experts to ask a lot of questions
[18:12:00] <theskillwithin> set theory can get existential right? like in godel escher bach
[18:12:06] <greenbagels> [itchyjunk]: alternatively, think about how factoring a polynomial over C differs than that over R
[18:12:08] <Guest71> https://i.imgur.com/R1dM496.png The first step for me is to find dy/dx. That means: -sin^(-2)(x) - sin^(-2)(y(x)) * dy/dx = 0 and then we solve for "dy/dx" ?
[18:12:42] <greenbagels> as in, z^4-4 is easily factorable into (z^2+2)(z^2-2) over R; why can't z^4+4 be done this way?
[18:12:46] <[itchyjunk]> greenbagels, not too fimiliar with factoring in C. but in R, iirc, i could long division

[18:27:14] <greenbagels> im sure you can do either
[18:27:23] <[itchyjunk]> never seen it that way before
[18:27:40] <greenbagels> i imagine it only matters if you're doing grammar stuff
[18:27:49] <[itchyjunk]> true
[18:27:51] <tolarz> the ZF set builder has notation {x ∈ A | phi(x)}
[18:28:01] <FriendlyPigeon> Is there any way I can verify what I'm typing in my own?
[18:28:04] <tolarz> I've never seen {x < 1 : x ∈ R}
[18:28:08] <tolarz> and I would call it ill-formed
[18:28:10] <CuriousErnestBro> "x in R such that x smaller than 1" reads more naturally
[18:28:18] <[itchyjunk]> FriendlyPigeon, by having experience in it
[18:28:19] <FriendlyPigeon> Like is there a way to plug {x^2 | x ∈ Z} into wolfram alpha or such to see what it looks like
[18:28:26] <[itchyjunk]> or refrencing some stuff like books and google
[18:28:33] <[itchyjunk]> yes
[18:28:36] <tolarz> There is this notation {e(x) | x ∈ A} which maps all elements x ∈ A to e(x)
[18:28:38] <FriendlyPigeon> Or any other tool to play with stuff to see what it looks like
[18:28:48] <tolarz> But note that e(x) is an expression, not a proposition
[18:28:49] <FriendlyPigeon> I tried plugging in a few different ways to wolfram alpha and it would not take it
[18:28:58] <[itchyjunk]> there are tooks
[18:29:00] <[itchyjunk]> tools*
[18:29:07] <[itchyjunk]> that return venn diagram given a set
[18:29:16] <[itchyjunk]> i dont remember, probably google knows
[18:29:19] <tolarz> so in a sense, I would say {x < 1 : x ∈ R} = {true, false}
[18:29:34] <quantum> tolarz: That's similar to the list comprehensions or set comprehensions from programming languages I feel
[18:29:37] <[itchyjunk]> greenbagels, it went over my head :(
[18:29:51] <greenbagels> [itchyjunk]: what's (x+ai)(x-ai)
[18:29:58] <tolarz> quantum: yes, {e(x) | x ∈ A} is list comprehension; {x ∈ A | phi(x)} is filter

[18:34:38] <[itchyjunk]> fields, rings etc dont exist
[18:34:51] <cherim> My example was "do the same as in Markov chain, except when you are at A and just came from a hotel. Then return to the same hotel"
[18:35:40] <CuriousErnestBro> cherim the taxi driver picks up 2 people with probability pi and 1 person with probability 1-pi, then he wrote down the 4 possible routes the taxi driver can take, and he solved it for first-order probabilities to get pi, and showed that it violates the markov property.
[18:36:12] <greenbagels> [itchyjunk]: ok well the takeaway is like, back in Reals Land you could take something like x^4-4 and say "well let's just treat x^2 as our unknown, maybe call it y; then we have y^2-4 which is (y+2)(y-2) = (x^2+2)(x^2-2)"

[19:07:19] <Z-module> (atlas*)
[19:07:42] <FriendlyPigeon> is unit circle literally just the point (0, 0)
[19:08:24] <FriendlyPigeon> oh wait no it says CENTERED at (0, 0)
[19:08:42] <quantum> FriendlyPigeon: The unit circle is the set of points in the plane which are at a distance 1 from `(0,0)`
[19:09:06] <FriendlyPigeon> ohhhhhh ok
[19:09:07] <Z-module> right, the points of the unit circle are all (x,y) with x^2 + y^2 = 1, so (0,0) is not one of those points.

[19:40:22] <greenbagels> the 5 is only labeling the distance below the box, i should amend
[19:40:31] <greenbagels> the total length is 7.5
[19:41:09] <greenbagels> so 2.5/7.5 = AQ/4
[19:41:25] <greenbagels> so AQ is a third of the prism's base length, which gives you AQ = 0.5 QD

[22:32:19] <Simplar> I'd assume CPQ1 is a right triangle
[22:32:33] <buster> Simplar, here we have Q+a(M-Q)=D₁+b(A₁-D) for some real numbers a and b. You can rearrange this to M-Q = c(D-Q) + d(A₁-D) where c=1/a and d=b/a. Then the question is to find c and d. This can be seen as a transition from one basis to another.

[23:39:33] <greenbagels> oh wait lol im silly
[23:39:42] <Simplar> now I need to divide a by |a|, and b by |b|?
[23:39:55] <greenbagels> yeah it does; you can determine the needed N by 1/2^N right
[23:40:13] <greenbagels> you just need 1/2^N < eps which guarantees the rest of the interval is less than eps
[23:40:26] <Simplar> That parametrizes the N lol

[23:40:46] <Simplar> ah, k!
[23:41:09] <greenbagels> yes you divide the two vectors by the norms you calculated, and then you should obtain vectors of length 1

[23:48:17] <greenbagels> f_n is arbitrarily close to 1 on [0,1) for any n, whoops
[23:48:33] <greenbagels> my intuition for uniform convergence clearly needs some work
[23:48:46] <cherim> Alternatively, if it were uniformly convergent on [0,1), it were uniformly convergent on [0,1] since at 1 there is no discrepancy with the limit
[23:49:52] <cherim> And you can't have a discontinuity in the uniform limit of continuous functions
[23:50:21] <greenbagels> fair point

[23:56:23] <rain3> to me it also looked that it uniformly converges to f:[0;0.5]->[0;0.5] . but the other person is not so sure, the debate is still going
[23:57:14] <greenbagels> why not just suggest the desired N(epsilon) ?
[23:57:21] <greenbagels> they can verify themselves that it works
[23:57:33] <greenbagels> or are you waiting for them to realize it
[23:57:49] <rain3> I suggested N=ceiling(log epsilon / log x)
[23:58:24] <rain3> I said "as this must happen for all values of x , we choose the biggest x for  N=ceiling (log epsilon/log x)
[23:58:24] <rain3> because the bigger the x, the slower x^n gets shrinken"
[23:58:35] <rain3> the other person said "This is pointwise convergence"
[23:59:11] <greenbagels> yes, that is true; but you can come up with an N that doesn't depend on x
