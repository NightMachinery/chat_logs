[00:02:29] <Brekkjern> Because you keep forgetting how incessantly shit everything was before.
[00:03:15] <Brekkjern> I too harken back to the days when the computer crashed completely every time a driver encountered something slightly odd.
[00:04:24] <manicennui> Brekkjern: That was much more a DOS/Windows thing.
[00:05:06] <manicennui> Windows was unstable as fuck until maybe 2005 or so.
[00:06:27] <manicennui> But I also don't think software was necessarily better. It was just simpler in many cases.
[00:06:35] <manicennui> We have needlessly complicated a lot of shit.
[00:07:10] <manicennui> We exchanged all of the extra power we got from newer hardware for more abstractions.
[00:15:37] <Church> Xe: Looking over the code for mkvm and paring it down to the essentials I think I've ended re-implemented this in shitty bash lol
[00:16:00] <Xe> Church: yeah, i only really did it in go because it got beyond my bash-fu
[00:16:08] <Church> Nod nod
[00:16:17] <Church> I'll drop my module here once I test it some more

[02:35:25] <gwozniak> Oof. After my 3rd dose the tiredness hit me like a truck and I just slept the entire afternoon
[02:35:38] <gwozniak> I haven't felt that run down in a while...
[02:35:58] <Brekkjern> Yeah. I had that for like 3 days :S
[02:38:15] <gwozniak> Happy to say I feel better now
[02:39:04] <gwozniak> Usually when I have a long nap during the day I have a helluva time falling asleep again.  I don't think that will be the case today
[02:44:13] <gwozniak> manicennui: to the earlier comment about "Blockchains can trim a lot of the fat...", I have this wild thought that it's like religion: the belief that what is behind everything is simple and we are astray when we embrace complexity
[02:45:17] <gwozniak> Those who turn to deities to explain that which they don't understand, from my experience, do so because they are not comfortable with the idea of something being meaningless or messy
[02:45:19] <manicennui> I generally get the sentiment behind libertarianism and wanting everything to be simple and humans to be perfectly rational, but you can't go very long without nothing but contrary evidence.
[02:45:43] <gwozniak> Yeah, that's the part that is weird.  Because it's so obvious it doesn't work
[02:45:50] <manicennui> That wasn't worded well, but hopefully it makes sense.
[02:46:19] <gwozniak> Libertarians like to bitch about big government, but... have you ever worked in a big company?  It's the same confusion and mess
[02:46:39] <gwozniak> Except generally with worse incentives
[02:48:08] <gwozniak> People generally don't like it when they want something to change and it takes a long time to do that.  So, like the idea of big software rewrites, they think the problem is fundamental and feel they can redo the system to make it faster
[02:48:23] <gwozniak> Instead of, say, studying what is there and understanding how it came to be
[02:49:04] <gwozniak> Or even worse, discarding the whole idea of such a question in the first place
[02:50:13] <gwozniak> Blockchain/NFTs/crypto/web3/DWeb all have this toxic naivete behind them
[02:52:24] <riv> yeah if the free market worked, printers/printer ink wouldn't be like that
[02:56:26] <manicennui> gwozniak: All of this made worse by the crazy shit we leave to the states in the US.
[02:57:34] <manicennui> Most of what the federal government should do outside of foreign policy is things like protecting human rights and workers right and standardizing things where it is insane to have 50 sets of laws.
[02:59:57] <manicennui> It's hard to think of many things where it makes sense to have different laws in different states.
[03:00:05] <manicennui> It's typically just used to abuse people.
[03:00:50] <manicennui> But I agree that large companies are just as dysfunctional, and the problem is just large organizations.
[03:01:29] <manicennui> You might be able to deal with this to some extent by setting regulations and then having more localized enforcement and implementation.
[03:02:13] <manicennui> With the ability of the federal government to step in if you fuck it up.
[03:02:48] <manicennui> Obviously the problems are complex and there are no simple solutions.
[03:05:37] <manicennui> I wonder how much money we wasted on duplicated departments in every state.
[03:13:21] <manicennui> Someone deleted the anti-vaxx conversation on our Slack.
[03:13:25] <manicennui> Wonder what is going on.
[03:14:37] <manicennui> "Upon further review, we have removed the previous Slack thread. One of the documents made a reference to rape that we deem offensive and inappropriate."
[03:16:23] * manicennui waits for some idiot to take exception to the removal.

[04:18:52] <ngoldbaum> got within 50 yards of a bald eagle today :)
[04:19:00] <gwozniak> Cool!
[04:19:00] <ngoldbaum> really nice day
[04:19:17] <gwozniak> I think one flew past our apartment once
[04:19:23] <gwozniak> It was huge
[04:20:05] <ngoldbaum> he was surveying a big field up in a cottonwood
[04:21:53] <gwozniak> Was it perched and did you see it take off?
[04:23:23] <gwozniak> ``I think the model for Web 2.0 was much the same as the model for society before the internet existed. If you go back 500 years, people basically just stuck to their little villages and townships.''
[04:23:26] <gwozniak> I mean...
[04:23:43] <gwozniak> Is this utter ignorance and/or cynicism?
[04:24:00] <gwozniak> Because a cursory study of history will tell you that's not even close to true
[04:24:25] <gwozniak> This is from Gavin Wood, btw
[04:24:59] <ngoldbaum> didn’t see him take off, he was perched up there the whole time
[04:25:00] <gwozniak> And David Graeber made a great case in his book "Debt" that this isn't even how commerce evolved anyway
[04:25:10] <ngoldbaum> glancing around
[04:25:15] <manicennui> gwozniak: I don't even know how that is similar to web 2.0.
[04:25:22] <ngoldbaum> got some nice profile views through binocs
[04:25:27] <gwozniak> ngoldbaum: nice.  I still haven't seen an eagle perched anywhere
[04:26:12] <manicennui> A hawk ate some animal in a tree outside my window a few weeks ago, and I saw it again in the same spot recently.
[04:26:17] <ngoldbaum> lots around here
[04:26:25] <ngoldbaum> barr lake state park regularly has dozens
[04:26:32] <ngoldbaum> it’s a rookery
[04:27:19] <gwozniak> There's a hawk that has territory around my apartment.  I see it gliding all the time
[04:27:29] <gwozniak> The crows divebomb it sometimes
[04:29:02] <ngoldbaum> crows are assholes like that
[04:31:59] <gwozniak> The hawk doesn't seem to care all that much.  Probably annoyed, tho
[04:32:39] <gwozniak> manicennui: these shitbags are literally making up narratives at this point
[04:35:02] <manicennui> Hawks?
[04:35:13] <manicennui> =P
[04:35:29] <manicennui> The thing he pasted was quite long.
[04:35:36] <manicennui> I only shared a few small bits of it.
[04:35:56] <manicennui> It had three or four common arguments that they use.
[04:36:04] <manicennui> Just so bizarre to see someone do it at work.
[04:36:19] <gwozniak> Yeah, those damn hawks!
[04:37:08] <manicennui> Tests being like rape is a new one for me though.
[04:37:55] <gwozniak> ngoldbaum: I only learned a few years ago that eagles nest on the Niagara Escarpment (which I basically live on) so I always hope to see one closer some day

[06:02:21] <manicennui> Settle down there cool guy!
[06:49:03] <imode> I've been weirdly into the Disney Renaissance recently. mostly about how creative talent can change within a company who's business is entertainment over a long enough timeline.
[06:49:17] <imode> and because my sister and wife grew up with a majority of the films from that era.
[06:50:28] <imode> I wonder why these films were so good and what made production conditions different than the modern day. producing hand-animated feature films was and is difficult, but you have content pipelines that are miles long these days.
[06:50:34] <manicennui> I was about 11 at the state of the Disney Renaissance and never really go into those movies.
[06:51:13] <manicennui> s/state/start/
[06:51:30] <imode> I wasn't a heavy fan but by cinema standards they certainly were spectacles. I can appreciate the art and as a kid I liked 'em a lot.
[06:51:54] <manicennui> The Land Before Time on the other hand...
[06:51:56] <imode> it feels like they have more imagination and feeling put into them than most if not all similarly-themed features today, which is a shame.
[06:52:16] <imode> maybe it's because you actually have to hire people that knew how to animate, storyboard and write.
[06:52:34] <imode> instead of shoving it all through massive content pipelines with thousands of possible sources of material.
[06:53:17] <manicennui> I think the celebrities doing voices took me out of them.
[06:53:28] <manicennui> And the bad pop music that was clearly designed to sell soundtracks to the masses.
[06:54:12] <imode> heh.
[06:54:19] <imode> musical numbers were pretty common.
[06:54:25] <imode> but I wouldn't call it pop music.
[06:56:22] <manicennui> I like musical numbers, but the music in those movies were pretty lame.

[06:57:42] <imode> meh. it's not the same.
[06:57:43] <manicennui> For animation Japan is way better though.
[06:58:17] <imode> there's very little charm in anything.
[06:58:49] <imode> and stuff that should ideally be for adults is uh, in way too many places it shouldn't be.

[19:31:50] <manicennui> companion_cube: Looks like it peaked and came back down.
[19:32:30] <companion_cube> but the share price is way higher :)
[19:34:50] <manicennui> That's not how it works.
[19:35:53] <companion_cube> no, it's just impressive for a basically new company
[19:36:10] <manicennui> It really doesn't mean much of anything.
[19:36:16] <manicennui> You'd have to know what the price was at IPO.
[19:36:30] <manicennui> Stock prices are only meaningful when compared against the same stock's price at other points in time.
[19:36:35] <manicennui> They don't have inherent meaning.
[19:38:02] <manicennui> Their IPO was $23 per share at the end of 2018, so it has about 10xed.
[19:38:18] <manicennui> It is really good, but I'm not sure how it compares to anything else that IPOed recently.
[19:38:30] <manicennui> The stock market is pretty divorced from reality generally.
[19:39:16] <companion_cube> even with stuff like covid? :D

[19:39:38] <manicennui> Especially with covid.
[19:39:56] <manicennui> I'm not saying Moderna's price is off, but a lot of stocks go up in value for no reason.

[22:54:41] <buttsbot> Lawsuit aiming to break up Facebook group Meta can go ahead, US court rules | Meta | The Guardian
[22:55:59] <manicennui> "Meta’s platforms are used by 2.8 billion people around the world on a daily basis."
[22:56:14] <manicennui> How much of the Earth's population is too much for one's company's userbase?
[22:57:07] <manicennui> "In his ruling denying dismissal, the judge, however, said that the FTC could not press allegations that Facebook blocked competing apps from accessing its platform as a way to maintain its dominance, saying the policies had been abandoned in 2018."
[22:57:10] <manicennui> Really?
[23:05:53] <edk> that's pretty dumb
[23:06:37] <Brekkjern> Huh. There are a LOT of pixels in a 4k video...
[23:06:47] <Brekkjern> I mean, of course there are, but you never really think about it you know?
[23:07:27] <Brekkjern> I have a clip that is 24 FPS at 3840x2160 pixels. That's nearly 200 million pixels a second.
[23:08:07] <Brekkjern> It's mindboggling that I can even have a steady 24 frames being beamed into my eyes with that number of pixels
[23:27:23] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern: the newest iphones can do 4k 60 fps but apple only turns it on if you have 512 gb or more of storage
[23:27:31] <ngoldbaum> otherwise it’d fill up the phone too fast
[23:27:42] <Brekkjern> Yeah, that's the camera though
[23:27:48] * ngoldbaum wishes flash was cheaper
[23:27:54] <Brekkjern> I'm just thinking about this from the practical point of showing it
[23:27:58] <Brekkjern> The numbers are just wild

[23:48:19] <manicennui> "Lincoln Logs are an American children's toy consisting of square-notched miniature logs used to build small forts and buildings. They were invented around 1916 by John Lloyd Wright, second son of the well-known architect Frank Lloyd Wright."
[23:48:22] <manicennui> I didn't know that.
[23:51:57] * manicennui learns that Heidegger was into cottagecore.
