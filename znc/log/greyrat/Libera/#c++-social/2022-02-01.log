[01:32:37] <sbrothy> not that bad

[01:33:02] <sbrothy> sweden has it's charms
[01:33:12] <sbrothy> buying alcohol isnt one of them :)
[01:33:43] <sbrothy> its like entering a pharmacy

[15:34:57] <jotham> iirc when the year is the same as the zodiac it offends some chinese spirit so you face more adversity
[15:35:08] <Carbonflux> https://www.amazon.com/Dungeon-Bunny-Book-Heroic-Saga-ebook/dp/B093NW364G
[15:35:17] <Carbonflux> great book
[15:35:27] <Renderwww> is it hurting the feelings of the chinese people? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurting_the_feelings_of_the_Chinese_people
[15:36:41] <Carbonflux> the water tiger is a happy tiger, a good tiger.
[15:37:10] <Carbonflux> tigers are good swimmers.
[15:38:50] <Carbonflux> wanting the world to end in darkness and terror is fairly popular right now, but i will always submit the true horror is that the world goes on, naturals systems are mature nanotechnology, we will never out smart them. life will always go on.

[15:39:46] <Carbonflux> no matter how much we want the world to end, life just lives. Its way smarter than we are.
