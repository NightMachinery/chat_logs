[07:49:28] <moose> So what's really the point of publishing your release signing key alongside the ISO and instructing users to verify the signature?
[07:49:43] <moose> They're both hosted in the same physical system heh
[07:50:16] <moose> The website is restricted to TLS only. I imagine if someone was going to MITM your download, they would be kind enough to give you their own release signing key and signature file.
[07:50:19] <danieldg> moose: it was more useful back in the day when the iso would be on mirrors
[07:50:40] <moose> Yeah, I kinda figured that. Like for a torrent, it's fine. But they have a separate release key for the torrent file itself even.
[07:50:53] <moose> Referring to QubesOS, of all things, too.
[07:51:09] <danieldg> if the key is in the web of trust, that can bootstrap things
[07:51:44] <Peng> There's also some value in TOFU systems. If the server gets compromised after you downloaded the key, you can detect malicious binaries later.
[07:51:57] <Peng> (Unless someone compromises the signing key when they compromise teh rest of the build infrastructure!)
[07:52:16] <danieldg> a good release signing key isn't on the build server
[07:52:29] <Peng> I usually loathe TOFU as a useless half-measure, but sometimes it helps
[07:53:50] <Peng> It's also still pretty common for Linux package repositories to encourage using plain HTTP for actual downloads. HTTPS is growing but not universal.
[07:54:52] <Peng> Download the key and instructions from https://www.example.com/packages/ or whatever and configure "deb http://packages.example.com/..."

[16:49:20] <sshine> rk4, the only thing I like about DRM is that it's essentially futile.
[16:50:14] <sshine> int-e, the tax of not knowing how to operate your "own" equipment comes one way or the other.
[16:51:40] <sshine> int-e, I've recently seen some cases of Google smart-home equipment rolling out new firmware that removes basic functionality like web browsing. it is, of course, upsetting to buy a thing and then down the line, that thing is reduced in quality not because the hardware deteriorates, but because of corporate decisions.
[16:52:59] <MacGyver> > smart-home equipment > basic functionality like web browsing.
[16:53:05] <MacGyver> I mean, come on.
[16:53:09] <sshine> int-e, or e.g. when it was assessed that some Google sound systems infringed on Sonos wrt. volume control, and they basically just removed the ability to control the volume across devices, rather than cough up the royalties.
[16:53:09] <MacGyver> Sounds like a plus to me.
[16:53:12] <labrador> sshine, I'd explain a lil bit more on that tax. Whenever you give up control on your systems for convenience and let some company handle it for 'free'. You'll get fucked someday
[16:53:16] <labrador> Its just gonna happen
[16:54:02] <sshine> MacGyver, the particulars don't matter. you buy a product because you know it can do X, and months later, MegaCorp does so that it can't because of legal reasons, not practical reasons. it is possible to design technology where you don't suddenly get retroactively ripped off.
[16:54:24] <sshine> labrador, we're all in that boat. I certainly don't understand my entire daily tech stack. :)
[16:54:42] <labrador> sshine, hey atleast its lesser...
[16:55:21] <sshine> labrador, I believe I just huddle up in another corner than most when I hope my tech won't break faster than I can replace it.
[16:55:37] <labrador> lmao
[16:55:39] <sshine> labrador, but you're right :) I can afford cheaper, better choices by investing my time.

[21:16:38] <sol> opinions are subjective, but for me, yes
[21:18:53] <piou> Everything: one thing to consider is that the modern position on cryptography is that being able to use a system correctly isn't enough. It should be hard to use it incorrectly. RSA doesn't pass that test at all.

[21:35:32] <Everything> OK. So basically, RSA is just slow and hard to implement correctly.

[21:57:00] <iz> right, but if there's a risk of eavesdroppers on the network, there's a risk of those eavesdroppers being bad actors to the p2p network

[23:44:55] <TimMc> moose: "Americans will use anything but the metric system" :-P
[23:45:24] <moose> Alipha: very good then
[23:45:37] <moose> TimMc: I use the metric system thank you very much
[23:45:48] <TimMc> same :-)
[23:46:08] <TimMc> (OK, what it actually says is that 1 Joule is approximately « The energy required to lift a medium-sized tomato up 1 metre (3 ft 3 in), assuming the tomato has a mass of 101.97 grams (3.597 oz). »)
[23:46:25] <moose> excellent
[23:46:32] <TimMc> Love the five significant figures on the mass of the medium sized tomato.
[23:47:33] *** Quits: gproto23 (~gproto23@user/gproto23) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:48:15] <moose> TimMc: I'm going to weigh a medium tomato tomorrow I think.
[23:48:44] <yawkat> it's just 1kg/(9.81m/s^2)
[23:49:28] <moose> I need more uses for my analytical balance after all
[23:50:04] <sarnold> are you comparing the inertial mass of the tomato against the gravitational acceleration experienced by the tomato?
[23:50:33] <yawkat> they just didnt want to write "tomato weighing 1N"
[23:51:07] <TimMc> ...I suddenly want 3.6 ounces of figs
[23:51:22] <moose> Why not 3.597oz of figs?
[23:51:56] <TimMc> Covering for possible mass loss due to dehydration, I suppose. :-)
[23:52:17] <TimMc> Heck, make it 4 oz and I can snack a bit.
[23:52:23] <TimMc> and still have a fig Newton left over
[23:53:07] <TimMc> moose: Analytical balance, is that something with a large ratio between capacity and precision?
[23:54:27] <moose> it's a really accurate scale for taking precise mass measurements
[23:54:41] <moose> generally has draft compensation and is externally as well as internally calibrated
[23:56:10] <TimMc> Oh, it would have like... draft shielding. I've seen that.
[23:56:14] <moose> yeah
[23:57:11] <TimMc> I bought a milligram scale a couple years back (1 mg precision, 50 g capacity) and it has been great for getting repeatable quantities of spices in my recipes.
[23:57:48] <TimMc> but I noticed that sometimes if I put my hand over it, the display drops by like 10 mg :-P
[23:58:01] <sarnold> massive hand? :)
[23:58:11] <moose> from the movement of air?
[23:58:13] <moose> or what
[23:58:24] <sonOfRa> TimMc: heh, when I ordered mine, amazon recommended I also buy a bunch of tiny plastic bags. Wonder what that was about :D
[23:58:25] <TimMc> Never did figure out if that was a draft effect, electrostatic, thermal pressure (?!), or what.
[23:58:34] <TimMc> sonOfRa: Oh yeah, the reviews were great.
[23:58:38] <moose> if the cup is quite large, it could be a draft
[23:58:44] <TimMc> "This is great for weighing my drugs".
[23:58:47] <moose> but if it's smaller, it'll usually be 1-4g off or something
[23:58:59] <moose> but it will settle, unless there's a continuous draft
[23:59:12] <moose> so like, a ventilation hood over your prep/stove area may cause it
[23:59:25] <sarnold> sonOfRa: so you can preportion your spices for very fast meal prep! they probably had some nice knives and wee tiny little spoons and maybe some papers in the related products section...
[23:59:46] <sonOfRa> heh
