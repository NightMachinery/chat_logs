[08:42:50] <twb> So like is the person you mean a rajput with some rajput culture and rajput language, or are they ONLY "an indian" with only hindi and only pan-hindu culture and religion
[08:42:54] <codingquark> .in has many factory workers, drivers, engineers etc etc etc
[08:43:20] <codingquark> twb: some are actually trying to pull that off, have been trying for long
[08:43:35] <codingquark> Check what Maharashtra did to people from Uttar Pradesh
[08:43:51] <twb> That's why people in USA are like "I am african-american" because all their heritage and ethnicity has been deliberately destroyed by US society, before they were even born

[11:52:35] <euouae> wasamasa, hey are you available? I have some progress to share: The GnuTLS discussion on Emacs mailing list got me to the point where it was agreed that I could share a bug fix providing the required functions.
[11:52:45] <euouae> Also independently I read a book on PKI and now I have a clue on x509
[11:53:09] <euouae> so my only thing to ask you is, after gnutls-boot-parameters is called in circe, which just sets up a data structure with data in it, where does it end up?
[11:53:36] <euouae> Do you just call gnutls-cli to init a connection with circe?
[11:56:32] *** Joins: CrazyEddy (crazyed@2603:300a:1d10:c000:de4a:3eff:fe88:cc5f)
[12:03:20] <euouae> OK yeah that seems to be it. 
[12:03:41] <wasamasa> uhh
[12:03:48] <twb> euouae: emacs uses libgnutls
[12:03:50] <wasamasa> gnutls-cli is not called unless emacs doesn't support gnutls
[12:03:58] <twb> euouae: you don't call the CLI at all unless you're using emacs 25
[12:04:01] <wasamasa> it uses the gnutls library when possible
[12:04:30] <euouae> wasamasa ah ok, I can't trace where exactly the gnutls-boot-parameters are passed?
[12:04:38] <euouae> make-network-process is the function then?
[12:04:59] <wasamasa> see irc.el
[12:05:14] <euouae> twb ah yeah indeed, I'm trying to add a few functions to the lisp wrapper over gnutls 
[12:06:31] <euouae> Ah so make-network-process is an Emacs core function
[12:08:00] <wasamasa> now, if someone can figure out how to use gnutls support without gnutls-boot-parameters to work on even lower emacs versions than currently, that would be great
[12:09:28] <euouae> You want to increase the version support of circE?

[12:12:31] <wasamasa> yes, it's declarative style
[12:12:49] <wasamasa> whereas the old API expects you to establish a network process, then do gnutls negotiations and shit
[12:13:25] <euouae> isn't the *-parameters function passed to the make-nw-proc function?
[12:13:38] <euouae> OK I'm just not familiar at all with the APIs you speak of 
[12:13:49] <wasamasa> this is a recurring pattern
[12:14:20] <euouae> but I did discover that not only gnutls has support for the encrypted x509 stuff we spoke of, but also hardware keys! so ... I might be able to get 2 with 1

[15:54:07] <Alice42> Hi, I am using Eglot + clangd for C++. My C++ project is managed by a Makefile and I generate a compile_commands.json when I compile. The compiler is not clang++ but a specific g++ which is specified in the Makefile and appears in the compile_commands.json. It looks like the compiler specified in the compile_commands.json is ignored and as a
[15:54:08] <Alice42> consequence I get lots of errors from clang.
[15:54:45] <Alice42> Is there a way to force Eglot to use the compiler specified in compile_commands.json?
[15:55:33] *** Joins: Guest-liao (~Guest-lia@101.86.100.106)
[15:57:06] <Alice42> When I compile using the Makefile I get no errors.
[16:00:01] <rpav> Alice42: clangd is what's giving errors; it can't "use" another compiler
[16:00:21] <rpav> assuming whatever Eglot is, is not compiling with clang for some reason, rather than your makefile
[16:01:04] <rpav> oh, that other lsp client thing
[16:02:15] <rpav> Alice42: if you're compiling something weird, with a weird gcc .. e.g. cross-compiling gcc or somesuch .. you may/probably need to specify additional locations to find its system headers
[16:03:57] <Alice42> But using emacs-lsp I can set arguments with clangd, for example --query-driver=/my/path/to/my/compiler and it works as expected. The thing is I have other problems with emacs-lsp so I am trying Eglot.
[16:04:15] <rpav> 🤔
[16:04:28] <Alice42> The system headers are specified in my compile_commands.json
[16:04:47] <Alice42> Let my find the variable I am talking about for emacs-lsp
[16:05:09] <rpav> ah, --query-driver appears to "extract system includes" from gcc-compatible compilers

[16:05:36] <rpav> if "lsp-mode is really slow" is your primary problem with lsp-mode, disable lsp-ui and possibly turn down/off file watches
[16:06:12] * rpav definitely didn't switch to emacs to have perceptible lag when moving the cursor
[16:08:42] <Alice42> @rpav the variable for emacs-lsp is (setq lsp-clients-clangd-args ("--query-driver=/usr/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc")
[16:09:28] <Alice42> emacs-lsp reconnect quite often and is problematic with finding the root of the project for reasons I ignore

[18:07:24] <Bayes> Since the beginning of the industrial age, the concentration of CO2 has increased from about 280 parts per million to over 390 parts per million to date. Furthermore, a global network of ground-based measurement sites has observed an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration by almost 20% over the past 50 years - the most dramatic change that we
[18:07:24] <Bayes> have ever seen in human history.
[18:07:39] <umaxtu> yup, we are so screwed

[18:10:24] <corwin> rudybot: today's fast-paced computing and technology development environments require us to move beyond standards based development toward bespoke ecosystems
[18:10:26] <umaxtu> iirc, the linux kernel just made a move that could enable the use of C11 features
[18:10:44] <rudybot> corwin: Ah. I thought it was a super-set. I was thinking more mainstream: Python, Ruby, Perl, Java. Or, thinking more in terms of ecosystems, there's Mono, GnuStep, ...? It seems to me we need a NanoScheme, the Scheme-you-can-write-an-interpreter-for-in-a-few-days, and then TheScheme, the huge pile of mud (with gem-like crystals!) for Getting Shit Done.

[21:11:37] <technomancy> edrx: require is normally how you load modules, or if a module is already loaded then ,reload module-name

[21:16:50] <akater[m]> hendursaga: First, why is this a  macro?
[21:18:10] <technomancy> edrx: well, fennel is going to try to convince you to not use globals
[21:18:27] <technomancy> but if you really need to do it that way: (global fennel (require :fennel)) then (fennel.dofile "whatever.fnl")

[21:27:10] <seabass> OK, let me rephrase - how can I find *exactly which function* is run when I click something?
[21:27:32] <seabass> when I hover over the element, it says that 'mouse-1 blah blah blah'
[21:27:45] <seabass> but C-k mouse-1 is not correct

[21:42:19] <technomancy> fun fact: the art actually came from a failed Dune 2 clone (which was a starcraft precursor)

[23:30:49] <johnjay> i feel like that reading linux man pages sometimes

[23:31:06] <seabass> until they can solve a little bit
[23:31:07] <hendursaga> so, I'm running Doom and it's been stuck at natively compiling 1 file for over 5 minutes, what gives? a super large file?
[23:31:12] <johnjay> long encyclopedic entry listing various little used features begins
[23:31:24] <seabass> whereas analysts might try to solve it all at once, bit by bit, eating away at the problem?

[23:33:21] <seabass> johnjay: yeah! I like man pages with examples
[23:33:39] <johnjay> yeah. there's nothing really more demoralizing than having one of those but not the other

[23:34:39] <johnjay> when people ask questions i often reply with the exact function they need
[23:34:49] <johnjay> like they'll say how do i move the cursor forward
[23:35:00] <johnjay> so i do M-x apropos forward then look for something that does that
[23:35:07] <johnjay> then say, maybe you need M-x forward-char?
[23:35:10] <johnjay> (dumb example)
[23:35:12] <seabass> johnjay: there's this thing... I don't know if you've heard of it... called a mouse?
[23:35:26] <seabass> :P
[23:35:37] <seabass> easiest way to move the cursor lol
[23:35:41] <johnjay> typically i assume there's a reason why they aren't using a mouse if they ask that
[23:35:49] <seabass> yeah true
[23:35:51] <johnjay> but my policy is to at least answer the stupid question first
[23:35:56] <johnjay> then followup with the, well did you really mean that?

[23:39:43] <johnjay> ah you're right
[23:39:47] <acdw> i should be paying attention here, there are a bunch of mouse-2 commands i'd like to rebind to mouse-1 or mouse-3
[23:39:48] <johnjay> they are both defined as that
[23:40:16] <johnjay> it literally says mouse-2 translated from mouse-1

[23:43:31] <johnjay> i dunno if that's a literal translation map or not
[23:44:23] <johnjay> at any rate dired.el directly defines dired-mode-map as inheriting from special-mode-map and mouse-2 as find file other window
[23:44:27] <johnjay> so i suppose it's intentional
