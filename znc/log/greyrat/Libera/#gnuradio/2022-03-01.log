[13:46:18] <LordKalma> I was reading the webpage
[13:46:19] <LordKalma> "Like UHD, RFNoC is also Free and Open Source Software (LGPL), and the full source code can be found in our public code repositories. "
[13:46:27] <LordKalma> what exactly needs to be licensed?
[13:47:06] <Yamakaja[m]> Vivado
[13:47:28] <LordKalma> ah that stuff yeah
[13:47:43] <LordKalma> free edition not enough?
[13:48:19] <drmpeg> Depends on the device.
[13:48:22] <Peanut> No, this is for a X310, its FPGA is too big for the free license.
[13:48:31] <LordKalma> bah
[13:48:38] <Yamakaja[m]> Node locked licenses are 3k, and with the free license you can't work with all FPGAs
[13:49:09] <LordKalma> such a shame
[13:49:09] <Yamakaja[m]> You said you were working with RFNoC before - did you have access to a license back then?
[13:49:12] <Peanut> *nods* I'm trying to put together a grant proposal that will include money for the license.
[13:49:48] <Peanut> Yes - my employer had a license back then, but has not been renewing it, so it won't work for Vivado 2019.1.
[13:50:17] <Peanut> My previous work was on 2017.4.
[13:50:31] <LordKalma> there's a big lack of free HDL synthesizers  :(
[13:50:37] <LordKalma> ghld when? :D
[13:50:45] <LordKalma> *ghdl
[13:51:25] <Peanut> LordKalma: I know - I'm using Yosys with my ECP5 boards, and that's so much nicer than the 35GB monstrosity that's Vivado.
[13:51:58] <tnt> 35G ? What version did you stop on ...
[13:52:15] <LordKalma> I had a digital design course in university, I don't recall the tolling we used
[13:52:17] <tnt> 2021.2 is 72G compressed.
[13:52:18] * LordKalma goes back to check
[13:52:59] <LordKalma> QuestaSim 10.4
[13:52:59] <LordKalma> Xilinx ISE 14.6
[13:52:59] <LordKalma> apparently
[13:58:51] <Yamakaja[m]> tnt: With filesystem compression and deduplication you can get some savings when installing multiple versions. I have 2019.1, 2020.1, 2020.2 and 2021.1 on my laptop (Which would ordinarily amount to 329GB), but thanks to btrfs i managed to squeeze that down to 97 GB :D
[13:59:30] <Peanut> Makes me wonder if Project X-Ray is at the level where it could be used to build firmware for a X310.
[14:00:04] <tnt> Peanut: it's not
[14:00:47] <tnt> Yamakaja[m]: interesting. It's actually installed on btrfs here, but not sure I have those turned on. I wonder if I can turn them on only for a given subvolume.
[14:10:18] <funkylab[m]> tnt: it's basically refcounting on extents. so, you can just run `duperemo -rd` (`-r` recurses, `-d` actually deduplicates) on a parent directory of your vivado installs
[14:10:24] <funkylab[m]> I pretty much do the same on XFS
[14:10:51] <tnt> funkylab[m]: Oh nice, I'll give that a shot.
[14:11:45] <funkylab[m]> good thing, nothing you'll have to enable – that reflink functionality is what makes snapshots tick, so it's integral to btrfs

[14:30:09] <funkylab[m]> Yamakaja[m]: No, can't do compression; dedupe is on Linux currently limited to XFS, btrfs, and a few networked FSes
[14:30:26] <funkylab[m]> "on a file level": if you mean hardlinks, that's different
[14:30:49] <LordKalma> I think I crashed it
[14:30:56] <funkylab[m]> if I change the content of a hardlink, it changes everywhere. If I change the content of a reflink'ed file, only "my" copy changes

[14:34:01] <funkylab[m]> btw, tnt, I guess this isn't really a problem **you** are likely to encounter, but do use modern coreutils. `cp` has better native reflink capabilities in recent versions (in fact, fedora has a pretty confusing backport of exactly that in f34's cp).

[16:43:18] <noc0lour_> was the contest about the most antennas to fit on a trailer? ;)
[16:46:22] <drmpeg> That was an awesome site. Drake Peak in eastern Oregon. https://www.w6rz.net/drake.jpg
[16:47:06] <drmpeg> We used to call the look out cabin the "Taj Mahal" of ham radio.
[16:50:45] <mhilts[m]> Kind of out there question, but does anyone know if there is a documented way to take an entire GNU Radio flowgraph and turn it into one block?
[16:50:59] <Yamakaja[m]> Hierarchical blocks maybe?
[16:51:18] <Yamakaja[m]> https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=Hier_Blocks_and_Parameters
[16:51:21] <Peanut> You could put it into a hiera - oh, Yamakaja was quicker in figuring out how to spell that word. :-)
[16:51:41] <mhilts[m]> Perfect thanks!
[16:52:38] <funkylab[m]> Peanut: kudos to Yamakaja, I typically just spell "hier block", and pronounce "hear block"

[19:42:39] <muaddib[m]> I think I’ve asked something similar to this before, but are there any examples of TDD-type applications in GNURadio? Like sending queued data to a USRP but only transmitting on an interval? 
[19:42:39] <muaddib[m]> Assuming a fixed frame length, transmit 1 frame, wait, send another? I understand that the radio will need to see samples the whole time to prevent underruns, so it seems like I’d need to switch between the data queue and a stream of zeros?
[19:42:39] <muaddib[m]> Anyone have experience with this or suggestions?

[20:02:42] <muaddib[m]> Jacob: would timing or pdu utils be the right answer here?
[20:02:46] <Jacob[m]12> this module was built to support that https://github.com/sandialabs/gr-pdu_utils
[20:02:46] <muaddib[m]> oops, just saw you typing
[20:03:14] <Jacob[m]12> there are slides from the 2019 presentation on it that are worth a read. just one approach
[20:03:30] <Jacob[m]12> no actual TX example code though, sorry
[20:03:51] <Jacob[m]12> well... there is a loopback example for latency evaluation
[20:05:21] <muaddib[m]> looking at the pdu to burst test. i think i see what you're saying
[20:06:38] <muaddib[m]> so the behavior here is to do what i was wanting? It just appends zeros when there's nothing coming in from the message port?

[20:06:51] <muaddib[m]> s/to do//
[20:07:26] <Jacob[m]12> it will use tx_sob/tx_eob tags to tell the usrp not to complain when it gets no data
[20:08:18] <muaddib[m]> ok, this is ringing a bell. i think this was the part where we decided I need to finally dig into stream tags.
[20:09:03] <muaddib[m]> ok, i see the PDU to Bursts does that automatically
[20:11:00] <Jacob[m]12> the early behavior just defines what should be done if the block is still in the process of emitting a burst of data and it receives another message
[20:12:58] <muaddib[m]> oh ok. so if  tx_sob/tx_eob are defined, the USRP doesn't need a steady stream?

[20:14:17] <muaddib[m]> j/k
[20:15:51] <Jacob[m]12> "need" is sort of a vague term... providing burst tags keeps it happy.
[20:16:11] <muaddib[m]> right, underruns won't necessarily kill it
[20:16:11] <Jacob[m]12> you can do this without them though
[20:25:56] <muaddib[m]> I'm trying this now, i assume that will produce Underruns?

[20:33:29] <Yamakaja[m]> "Finally preliminary results demonstrate that a processor embedded in an FPGA can compile, place, and route arithmetic and logic expressions inside the FPGA within a few milliseconds."
[20:36:00] <funkylab[m]> partial reconfig + softcpu + loading images at runtime is not that new an idea!
[20:36:16] <funkylab[m]> actually, was always kind of the promise with partial reconfiguration
[20:36:18] <Yamakaja[m]> Of course, this paper is from 2011
[20:36:38] <Yamakaja[m]> Still, that usually doesn't include generation of the bitstream on device
[20:39:15] <funkylab[m]> jep, but that's mostly because few people have the drive to install qemu on the linux they'd be running on their softcpu to run x86 ISE or vivado
[20:39:50] <Yamakaja[m]> Sounds like you'd have to wait roughly a year for vivado to build something on that
[20:42:23] <funkylab[m]> ah I mean we're not talking generation of Tbit/s of PRNG on the FPGA or something similiarly outlandishly unfeasible. Might just be something like an ethernet packet filter that looks at very simple patterns
[20:42:24] <funkylab[m]> as a use case
[20:43:26] <Yamakaja[m]> Even then, getting the vivado suite to run on such a processor sounds like hell. The reverse engineering approach appears much more reasonable to me in that regard (Insofar reverse engineering can be called reasonable outside of academic context)
[20:43:35] <funkylab[m]> yeah don't think about that
[20:44:25] <funkylab[m]> I could, however, very well see the experimental synthesizers of the time, some of which were designed by unis together with the FPGA companies in portable languages, could maybe do some of this
[20:44:46] <funkylab[m]> it's not like vivado is strictly the only thing targetting a Xilinx chip
[20:45:17] <funkylab[m]> as you know, there's also some synthesizers who might even get modern verilog array slicing right
[20:45:38] <Yamakaja[m]> Yeah ... 🤦‍♂️
[20:48:43] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> you're making me want to refresh my HDL
[20:49:04] <Yamakaja[m]> Great idea! :D
[20:49:23] <Yamakaja[m]> FPGAs are fun ... at least if you've got the patience
[20:49:35] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> last thing I did was a sonar in 2018, using verilog
[20:49:48] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> one of those demo boards with an audio codec integrated, a mic and a speaker...
[20:50:00] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> if it sounds like a uni course final project, it was
[20:52:01] <Yamakaja[m]> Neat! I'm currently doing FPGA work for my bachelors thesis (And waiting for vivado to run through)
[20:52:56] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> my master thesis was imaging techniques trough diffuse media haha
[20:53:23] <Yamakaja[m]> Interesting, so you were trying to undo the effect of the medium?
[20:53:34] <Yamakaja[m]> How well does that work?
[20:54:05] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> I reproduced 3 different techniques in the literature, there are couple approaches
[20:54:29] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> the most common one is "cheating" and involves calibrating the medium, basically, finding out its transfer function
[20:54:53] <Yamakaja[m]> I suppose if you've got access to the medium that's not an issue?
[20:55:23] <Yamakaja[m]> But how well can you perform deconvolution with that "measured" /"learned" transfer function?
[20:55:23] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> well, you still have to figure out how to calibrate it, which ain't that easy 
[20:55:32] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> not that bad, actually
[20:56:13] <Yamakaja[m]> And what's the application of those techniques? Hiding cameras?

[20:56:40] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> the ultimate goal is ultra-thin endoscopy

[20:57:14] *** Joins: Thorn (~Thorn@user/thorn)
[20:57:40] <Yamakaja[m]> I see, sounds reasonable. Obviously you can't really do calibration in that case, how well do the other techniques work?
[20:58:04] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> yes, that's the challenge atm, techniques without access to the distal end
[20:58:16] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> I no longer work on that, dunno what the current trends are
[20:59:01] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> but, as a demonstration

[20:59:10] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> what the camera sees vs what you can get back
[20:59:43] <Yamakaja[m]> With a calibrated medium?
[20:59:49] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> (tthe target was a grid of squares)
[21:00:51] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> that was not with calibrating, that exploits some properties of partial-coherence of laser light after it went trough the medium
[21:00:52] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> fun stuff
[21:01:23] <Yamakaja[m]> Wow :D
[21:02:18] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> that also requires some fun phase-retrieval algorithms, from the famous article by Fienup, 1993
[21:02:58] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> basically computing the phase components of a FT from only the amplitude components
[21:03:02] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> fun stuff
[21:04:35] <Yamakaja[m]> Phase retrieval from an amplitude spectrum? I'd love to have that in the RF/Signal domain :D
[21:05:28] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> well, a corollary of the correlation theorem is that a function and it's autocorrelation have the same amplitude components
[21:06:01] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> and in this technique you can get to the autocorrelation of the image, then you have to get the image from its autocorrelation
[21:06:12] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> and you can do that with the algos presented in that 
[21:06:16] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> * in that article*
[21:06:53] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> you need to make some assumptions about the original signal to have something to walk towards to, but it works
[21:07:41] <LK-CT7ALW[m]> for example, in this case, it's a fair assumption to say that a image field is a field of real numbers, so the phase components, when you do the IFT should result in a real signal
