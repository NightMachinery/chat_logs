[00:36:26] <ayecee> well i mean aside from installing a package manager separate from your distro's package manager

[04:11:08] <hi^-^> you get how it works?
[04:11:22] <Dagmar> Passwords are stored on remote sites both hashed because hash functions are generally not-reversible, but also *salted* because this makes it impossible to just _look up precomputed hashes_
[04:11:44] <schuelermine> hi^-^: Your proposed solution for password generation is vulnerable because it can be performed by an attacker to get your passwords.
[04:11:45] <Dagmar> A large pile of precomputed hashes is a thing called a "rainbow table"
[04:11:46] <schuelermine> This is true unless you use a salt to mix it up, at which point it‚Äôs basically what password managers do, just slightly more insecure

[04:15:49] <Dagmar> Behold the magic
[04:15:53] <schuelermine> Dagmar: it does mean your message trying to expose them as daft was daft
[04:15:57] <Psi-Jack> For simple hashing, SHA2-256 is actually pretty good, because between SHA2-512 and SHA2-256, SHA2-256 was actually designed to be computationally more slow than that of 512. So I've read in many technical articles. So hashing passwords comes with a cost of more cycles to repeatedly hash a password in that to try to make a brute force match.
[04:16:02] <schuelermine> regardless of if they‚Äôre daft
[04:16:15] <Dagmar> schuelermine: No it just means you're probably not qualified to make these determinations

[04:20:41] <Dagmar> Without salting, finding the plaintext of any of those hash mechanisms just becomes a matter of disk space and seek time
[04:20:54] <schuelermine> Psi-Jack: oh, bollocks, this library I‚Äôm using defaults to 10

[05:07:35] <hi^-^> Dagmar: also, if the website keeps your plain-text password, maybe in case it is compromised or you are being phished, they can't use it to guess what kinds of passwords you choose, or try them on other accounts of yours on other places.
[05:08:10] <hi^-^> _without_ the need of memorising many passwords, or using one password on more than one place
[05:08:23] <hi^-^> also people do remotely brute-force stuff.
[05:08:43] <sheep> just use a password manager. It memorises the passwords for you and prevents reuse
[05:08:59] <hi^-^> sheep: yes, i sent a message about that as well
[05:09:04] <onelegend> make sure you're using an open source password manager
[05:09:26] <felco> if you hash you password before sending feeding it to the site... then your password is the hash, right?
[05:09:29] <sheep> make backups and use an offline password manager
[05:09:32] <onelegend> felco: yup
[05:09:32] <hi^-^> sheep:  the point is that if you lost your storage, the password manager will be no good. if you stored the encrypted passwords in online storage, if the online storage goes out of service it will paralyze your life, your device can be stolen, you can get phished, and all that depending on how your password manager works.

[05:09:56] <sheep> hi^-^: if you can't memorize things or you get retrograde amnesia you'll lose the passwords too
[05:09:56] <hi^-^> sheep: the point of what i say is: you can keep everything in your brain, and it is in some ways better than the usual passwords you keep in your brain. not optimal security, but helps.

[05:56:43] <Skaface> im going to have a look at that now
[05:56:45] <Dagmar> You can be slightly more gnomic (confusing) by using grep's ability to return 1 or 0 based on whether or not it matched anything
[05:56:52] <Dagmar> ...but oit'
[05:56:57] <jim> some dists will look at certain shell scripts, to see if they have something like [[... and if so, they will complain if they don't also have #!/usr/bin/bash
[05:57:02] <Dagmar> ...but it's slightly faster than a string comparison
[05:57:03] <rascul> some editors are capable of having shellcheck as a plugin or something so your code is checked automatically
[05:57:12] <jim> (or wherever it is on yoiur system)
[05:57:15] <Dagmar> Won't really matter until you're in a loop doing it a hundred thousand times in a row

[12:31:19] <rudi_s> lockywolf: ping will only print packets it sent (details are a little more complex).
[12:31:28] <rudi_s> Use tcpdump icmp if you want to see if another host receives those packets.

[13:22:36] <DPA> But I used to have a similar issue one once. I had a VM with an interface in my dmz and in my lan, for my network share & DLNA server. DMZ->LAN access was blocked, LAN->DMZ access was possible, but DLNA/mDNS stuff needed multicast, which doesn't route.
[13:22:36] <DPA> DMZ needed access to files too. Then when I accessed the NFS on it over the DMZ interface, it went LAN PC <-> firewall <-> DMZ if server, but the server also saw the packages on the lan if,
[13:22:36] <DPA> and eventually got the destination over arp, so it decided to send them back over the lan if. The LAN PC then dropped the packages, because the source mac was wrong (server lan if, instead of firewall lan if mac). So I just blocked DMZ if access from lan to that server.

[14:56:55] <MrElendig> it allows you to have a "repo" of random distroes
[14:56:57] <hexnewbie> It's quote possible that "$file" is a result of *.filepart expansion, and you're emulating nullglob by checking if it remained a pattern (i.e. wasn't expanded)

[17:27:36] <itt788> the middle one doesn't not need to grow or shrink, but i want to add the free space to the third lv
[17:27:52] <ananke> itt788: so add it with lvresize -L+whatever

[17:34:12] <peetaur> if it's badly fragmented, it can affect speed a bit. And if it's at the start vs end of disk, it can also (start is the outer tracks which are larger so have more space so more size/rotation).

This doesn't occur if I delete something from  /home/superkuh/rob/video, if I do that it goes to /home/superkuh/rob/.Trash-1000/ as expected.

[18:18:27] <hexnewbie> superkuh: bind mounts in your home directory are weird (though if I'm reading this correctly they ought to be more or less indistinguishable from userspace), and bind mounts can affect checks for mountpoints (in fact, without statx() sometimes they can prevent them entirely)

[22:12:11] <Dagmar> The performance on var .= othervar always kinda sucks because there's no such thing as "simply appending" to a sequence of bytes in memory unless you are also managing memory directly
[22:12:13] <xx> Dagmar: I solved the mystery from the JPG having larger filesize than the PDF it was in. Somehow the pdf was created with /Filter[/FlateDecode/DCTDecode] so the JPG was not just embedded in it, but also additionally compressed with zlib.
[22:12:29] <MrElendig> onelegend: and then netgate decided to ship it anyway
[22:12:55] <xx> all is well now that only a single /Filter is in use
[22:12:58] <Dagmar> Simply appending a new item to an array just adds a pointer to a list that's already generally expected to thrash around quite a bit so it's _already_ had the space for several new pointers ready to go
