[01:39:21] <ubottu> Systems with certain graphics chipsets may not boot properly out of the box. "Temporarily Add a Kernel Boot Parameter for Testing" as discussed at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/KernelBootParameters to add the "nomodeset" parameter there.

[01:40:37] <toddc> Guest yes it will just work with minimal grafics then after install you add the nivdia driver done
[01:41:05] <tomreyn> "nomodeset" is to temporarily disable "kernel mode setting", a mechanism used by the proprietary nvidia graphics driver for interfacing with the kernel.
[01:41:51] <tomreyn> it would enable you to install all the pending updates, which *may* make the proprietary graphics driver work properly on the next reboot

[04:15:56] <IRCMonkey> Oh you meant the allocations ?
[04:16:00] <Bashing-om> IRCMonkey: Ubless you have a real need - I suggest the only seperate partition now-a-days is /home.
[04:16:24] <cbreak> zfs ftw
[04:16:54] <IRCMonkey> Ohhh gotcha
[04:17:07] <IRCMonkey> Not even "/" Root ?
[04:17:14] <tomreyn> IRCMonkey: unless you have broken hardware, ubuntu should boot faster with these specifications.
[04:17:19] <IRCMonkey> So I just allocate Swap & Root "."
[04:17:26] <IRCMonkey> - "/"
[04:17:41] <jushur> IRCMonkey: you can install ANY desktop enviroment and it should still be faster then windows.
[04:17:43] <tomreyn> IRCMonkey: 500 GB HDD sounds like it must be stone age and possibly falling apart, though
[04:17:57] <Bashing-om> xfs for servers with lots of data storage - can not be bettered - desktop still hard to beat ext4 - IMHO :D
[04:18:24] <jushur> IRCMonkey: if you can buy a cheap ssd and put in instead of that hdd it will be blazingly fast compared to now.
[04:18:44] <IRCMonkey> Ohhh
[04:19:12] <IRCMonkey> It takes 20 minutes for Windows 10 to boot to the desktop.
[04:19:25] <Bashing-om> IRCMonkey: No - a default install will make up a 'swap file' which is much more effecient these days.

[04:23:22] <Bashing-om> IRCMonkey: A new ubuntu user ? Take the easy route untill you know better and do that "erase disk and install". However there is a lot to be said for good in a seperate /home partition.
[04:24:07] <IRCMonkey> Yeah I have a 500 GB Hard disk, I want around 400 GB for my personal files —got lots to save !
[04:24:50] <Guest39> Bashing-om agreed
[04:25:01] <IRCMonkey> I've used Ubuntu once before for a short period (Jaunty Jackelope) was having trouble installing via Software Packager, was crashing.

[04:44:41] <Guest39> Thanks everyone for your help.
[04:45:22] <jacke> B4 you install any linux...run a live version to see if everything works...then install...
[04:45:40] <Guest39> The live install works perfectly fine
[04:45:52] <leftyfb> jacke: that doesn't always give you a good idea of how well it's going to run
[04:45:53] <Guest39> this is a video card issue
[04:46:00] <Bashing-om> IRCMonkey: Spaces: not what I implied - just that a space in a fike name takes extra care to cope with. Op Systems straight up will be seen as 2 files: "Op" and "Systems" also linux is case sensitive - op and Op are seen as 2 different files.
[04:46:01] <jacke> then you can make the install work just as well
[04:46:03] <Guest39> I think..
[04:46:05] <tomreyn> Guest39: :-/ sorry we couldn't help. one more thing that may be the diffference between live and install may be microcode updates.
[04:46:21] <IRCMonkey> Ohhh O.K.
[04:46:33] <IRCMonkey> No I don't plan on naming my drives or anything.
[04:46:43] <leftyfb> tomreyn: and hwe kernel and no running from squashfs and video drivers, etc
[04:46:45] <IRCMonkey> But filenames can contain spaces amirite ?
[04:47:17] <Guest39> jacke Probably yeah but I've been trying for the last ~6 hours with the help of people here and nothing worked so far so I'm done for the day :)
[04:47:17] <tomreyn> leftyfb: 21.04 has no hwe kernel by default
[04:47:37] <leftyfb> tomreyn: "<Guest39> I installed Ubuntu 20.4 hoping for a miracle and no"
[04:47:44] <tomreyn> Guest39: similar to "nomodeset" you can use "dis_ucode_ldr" to override the microcode loading
[04:47:58] <tomreyn> leftyfb: yes, but it was all about 21.04 before this.
[04:48:05] <leftyfb> ok, yeah, just joining now
[04:48:30] <Bashing-om> IRCMonkey: Yes file names "can" contain spaces but in use these spaces will have to be escaped so the system sees them as one file. A pain sometimes to keep track of.
[04:48:30] <Guest39> tomreyn No worries, really appreciate your inputs. Alright last test and I'm done for today ^^
[04:49:23] <tomreyn> Guest39: you're welcome
[04:50:29] <IRCMonkey> Oh O.K.
[04:50:58] <tomreyn> Guest39: yet another suggestion: this computer is old enough that it was probably shipped (and primarily tested) with classic bios booting by default. you could try switching to that (but need to reinstall then).

[04:53:15] <Guest39> The first install was with the BIOS option enable in BIOS. But I guess I also need to change the way I create my booting drive right?
[04:54:23] <tomreyn> if you make the bios boot in 'legacy' bios mode (rather than UEFI), then do a standard installation, you'll be set
[04:54:34] <tomreyn> but i'm not sure i got the question right
[04:56:33] <Guest39> Right now I'm using ventoy for my bootable drive using GPT partition. Do I need to create a more "old school" installation drive in addition to enabling Legacy BIOS?
[04:58:22] <oerheks> ventoy ... never heard of that before
[04:58:37] <tomreyn> i don't know for sure whether ventoy will be bale to boot in both uefi and bios mode, and whether it will be able to boot the ubuntu installer in either mode.
[04:58:54] <tomreyn> bale -> able
[04:59:10] <Guest39> I've got tons of usb drive I can just create another one the old school way
[04:59:39] <oerheks> Secure Boot was supported from Ventoy 1.0.07, but the solution is not perfect enough. So from ventoy 1.0.09, an option for secure boot is added in Ventoy2Disk.exe/Ventoy2Disk.sh and default is disabled. So by default, you need to disabled secure boot in BIOS before boot Ventoy in UEFI mode.
[04:59:48] <oerheks> hmmm, questionable tool it is..
[04:59:53] <oerheks> https://www.ventoy.net/en/doc_secure.html
[05:00:06] <Bashing-om> Guest39: Tje mode that you boot the installer in is the mode that will be used to install; Bios or UEFI.

[06:06:26] <guiverc> I'd assume bad write to media then.. I find about 5-8% of writes are bad (usb-flash-media is made to cost and not quality), so I'd try booting it on other box; if it doesn't complete media validation there - likely a bad write.

[06:10:18] <Guest39> guiverc Thanks for your input but this not my issue at all. I'm created 2 different install drive with 2 different method, the issue is the same. Live image is all good. Installed ubuntu "works" I just have display issue probably because of the Nvidia card.
[06:11:00] <Guest39> In any case I said I would stop troubleshooting for tonight, Just wanted to confirm that my way to create bootable drive had no issue..
[06:11:56] <guiverc> I didn't see your prior posts, your message I did see mentioned "used the ubuntu recommended way to create a install stick using Startup Disk Creator on Ubuntu... same issue" so my comment was based on that.

[09:20:51] <krytarik> lotuspsychje: Isn't that on-topic for here though?
[09:21:19] <Mekaneck> it is on topic imo
[09:21:33] <Mekaneck> it's a question about Ubuntu
[09:22:04] <lotuspsychje> i never said its offtopic, im suggesting he can discuss it further
[09:22:30] <Mekaneck> not needed in discuss :)
[09:23:05] <Mekaneck> IRCMonkey: long term support versus 9 month support, choose wisely

[14:41:34] <TJ-> shibboleth: I do a lot of hacking on GRUB so may be able to narrow this down
[14:41:44] <shibboleth> the boxes are identical. call the alice and bob. bob always fails to boot with grub > grub2 2.02-2ubuntu8.2. i can take the drive from alice, also fails in bob. drive from bob works fine in alice
[14:42:12] <shibboleth> TJ-, please xplain the adv submenu stuff?
[14:44:10] <shibboleth> i was hit by this issue in after an apt-get upgrade eraly/mid May. only thing that worked was to replace the .efi binaries in /boot/efi/... with the ones from  grub2 2.02-2ubuntu8.2. issue persist on all of the... four grub2 updates released since
[14:44:35] <TJ-> shibboleth: if you can access the GRUB menu (tapping Esc key as GRUB starts) or set the config to show it by default (/etc/default/grub "GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE="menu"  "
[14:45:00] <TJ-> shibboleth: then the Advanced sub-menu lists Recovery boot options, and they report what stage the file loading has got to.
[14:45:07] <shibboleth> yeah, one sec
[14:45:57] <TJ-> Therefore, if using one of those you don't see "Loading Linux..." we know it is happening before or during that stage. By adding your own "echo 'Reached stage X' " in front of each line in a menuentry block, you can identify exactly where GRUB is getting to
[14:46:09] <shibboleth> ok, in advanced. do in just select the recovery option or do i add any flags?
[14:46:47] <TJ-> shibboleth: initially I'd add a line just before the 'linux ...' line saying "echo 'About to load Linux...' " then Ctrl+X to boot with that, and see what you get
[14:47:56] <shibboleth> there already is an echo "Loading $linuxkernelversion"
[14:48:15] <shibboleth> and a sep one for init

[14:48:18] <TJ-> shibboleth: oh yeah, of course!
[14:48:56] <TJ-> shibboleth: ok, so just boot with that entry (I was thinking of the opposite of what I do when there are initrd.img problems and I add a line /after/ the intrd ... line to ensure it was loaded into memory
[14:49:12] <shibboleth> ok, loading linux $version, loading initial ramdisk -> freeze
[14:50:09] <TJ-> shibboleth: great... so now try again with my initrd process - add a line after "initrd ..." with "echo 'Loaded initrd, handing over to kernel now...' "

[20:09:14] <Guest67> thanks for the tip ioria. sadly while this does remove the "total" lines it still leaves empty lines between each group of files within any given sub-directory, and tit breaks the sorting.

[20:11:29] <Guest67> so yeah, using ls (or double l ;) alone for this is probably not the best idea. i was originally hoping to find an option within ls that says something like "do not list directories", instead i found that the tree command has the "-d" option to "list directories only". not exactly what i wanted.
[20:11:34] <RougeR> i know its a known but, but its just weird that i cant find anyone else with the same issue as me. I wonder if its something to do with 16:10 2560x1600 monitors...having 2 of them is not common

[23:54:33] <Surkow|laptop> Good evening. My power supply recently died from my dell xps m1330 laptop. After getting a new power supply the cpu was stuck at 800mhz for a while because the bios didn't detect a security pin in the new power supply. A new power supply with the security pin resolved this. The last few days I noticed the ondemand cpu governor kept getting stuck at 800mhz, while the processor can get to 2.5ghz.
[23:54:33] <Surkow|laptop> Repeatedly setting the governor to performance and then back to ondemand sometimes appears to help getting it "unstuck" from 800mhz. Changing "/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/ondemand/up_threshold
[23:54:33] <Surkow|laptop> " from 95 to 75 also appeared to work...for a while. It makes the system a bit faster to respond. The problem right now is that it hangs with normal usage in even the browser with a low clock rate. cpupower frequency-info gives me:  hardware limits: 800 MHz - 2.50 GHz, current policy: frequency should be within 800 MHz and 800 MHz. Shouldn't that say "within 800 MHz and 2.50 Ghz" or is this simply how the ondemand governor work
[23:54:38] <Surkow|laptop> s?
