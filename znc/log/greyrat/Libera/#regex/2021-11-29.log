[01:21:33] <cea> Hi, I need help, is possible make 1 group of this? https://regex101.com/r/uz3utw/1
[01:23:08] <yitz> cea: you can use () to make it a group. You can make other ()'s non-grouping with (?:exp)
[01:24:32] <cea> yitz I tried but make 3 groups
[01:24:55] <cea> https://regex101.com/r/a7vm3s/1
[01:25:00] <yitz> Are all the ()'s non-capturing except the outer one?
[01:27:00] <cea> Actually my problem is that I am doing a split in java with that regex, but for a string type "2.3 + 2 + 4", it returns ["", ".", "+", "+"] Instead of [ "+", "+"], so I think maybe it's a problem with my regex
[01:27:31] *** Joins: zaden (~maddx@c-73-92-207-228.hsd1.ca.comcast.net)
[01:28:00] <yitz> "split" usually drops the matching bits and gives you the bits in between
[01:28:47] <cea> Do you know any way to solve it? My solution is to simply remove it after doing the split
[01:29:12] <yitz> Don't call split if you want all the data. Match and access the matching groups.
[01:31:18] <cea> Extracting if it matches "x" group, right?
[01:33:37] <yitz> Sure? If you need different behavior based on different patterns, just test multiple regexes

[12:04:37] <Me-me> Don't be rude, digitok.
[12:04:48] <digitok> sorry
[12:06:00] <tester12> sorry another question
[12:06:29] <Me-me> Go ahead.
[12:06:30] <tester12> to accept empty string what add to regex?
[12:06:57] <Me-me> At that point you may as well have [0-9]{0,2}
[12:07:01] <Me-me> Well
[12:07:11] <Me-me> 1?[0-9]{0,2}
[12:07:17] <Me-me> Wait
[12:07:22] <Me-me> I'm distracted v_v
[12:07:36] <Me-me> [0-9]{0,2}|100
[12:07:52] <tester12>  ^[1]{0,1}[0-9]{0,2}$ ?
[12:07:52] <Me-me> To accept any zero to two digit string, or 100.
[12:08:06] <Me-me> No, that would accept 199
[12:08:19] <tester12> without decimal numbers?
[12:08:20] <Me-me> And also you don't need the [] if you're not including multiple characters inside the character class.
[12:08:26] <Me-me> ?
[12:10:51] <digitok> ^(?:100|[1-9]\d|\d)?$
[12:11:05] <digitok> assuming you do not want to allow leading zeros
[12:11:41] <digitok> ^(?:100|[1-9]?\d?)$
[12:11:43] <digitok> better
[12:12:03] <tester12> zero is in the accepted limitation
[12:12:10] <tester12> 0 - 100
[12:12:18] <digitok> i meant 03
[12:12:21] <digitok> etc
[12:13:20] <Me-me> 3 03 003 0003 00003 all mean the same number, but only the first one matches the pattern digitok gave.
