[22:01:57] <anton-latukha[m]> Either `lens 5.0.1` doesn't build, forcing newer `lens` - the `aeson 1.5.6` doesn't build.
[22:03:41] <anton-latukha[m]> * doesn't build, or forcing newer, * doesn't build. And I wanted to work on `head.hackage` listing and `aeson` is the most recent update there overall.
