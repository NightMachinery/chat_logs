[00:26:16] <shapr> JordiGH: I'm happy to explain more if you want
[00:26:54] <shapr> in general, an FP program is compiled to a graph, and that graph is reduced
[00:26:56] <JordiGH> What happened to that Haskell book where one author accused the other of stealing and then they were no longer friends?
[00:27:04] <shapr> that's an entirely different thing from imperative programming

[00:27:22] <shapr> that is, the first principles book
[00:27:29] <JordiGH> Yeah, but I want my computer to do things. What does my computer do with a graph?
[00:27:40] <shapr> lots of things
[00:27:56] <shapr> It's just another way to write a program
[00:28:02] <shapr> but the evaluation approach is different
[00:28:32] <shapr> one way of looking at a thunk is "a piece of the graph that might be needed for the final result"
[00:28:47] <JordiGH> Hm, Charles Scalfani, that doesn't sound like lets-get-legal Haskell book I was thinking of.
[00:29:11] <shapr> nah, I was talking about the book epilys mentioned
[00:29:27] <gwozniak> Reducing to a graph doesn't sound so different than what happens with C
[00:29:33] <shapr> gwozniak: yeah!
[00:29:44] <shapr> compiler produces SSA
[00:30:07] <JordiGH> I have a somewhat vague idea of what kind of opcodes C will produce.
[00:30:08] <shapr> though I'm not sure that the C runtime is like that
[00:30:11] <JordiGH> I have no idea what Haskell will do.
[00:30:28] <shapr> do you want a short intro?
[00:30:34] <gwozniak> GCC uses SSA internally before reducing to RTL, which is basically the opcodes
[00:31:24] <shapr> what about SSA at runtime?
[00:32:53] <gwozniak> There is no compilation at runtime for C, in the usual case.  If you are going to use it, you're using something custom
[00:34:01] <shapr> JordiGH: you know call by value and call by reference, right? there are more things along that line, Haskell is call by need https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Non-strict_evaluation
