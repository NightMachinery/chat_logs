[02:28:41] <TurkeyGibby> reading before and after the ferment 
[02:28:44] <fritzwastaken> MrsFritz and I just had a nice trip into a local main street town. Got some sweet ass retro gaming gear and some wendies burgers
[02:28:51] <fritzwastaken> Saturdays are awesome
[02:29:19] <TurkeyGibby> yuken: https://learn.kegerator.com/using-a-hydrometer/
[02:29:28] <TurkeyGibby> nice fritz :) 
[02:29:42] <fritzwastaken> I needed a gamecube save card
[02:29:54] <fritzwastaken> rather get it from a local shop over amazon
[02:29:59] <fritzwastaken> cause fuck bezos
[02:32:33] <TurkeyGibby> I should also note, yuken, larger batches are MUCH more forgiving than 1gal batches

[02:33:35] <TurkeyGibby> you've gotta be pretty precise on the small batches to remain consistent between brews and flavors
[02:34:36] <fritzwastaken> the burger I just from from wendies could be on the menu
[02:34:42] <fritzwastaken> it was fucking perfect
[02:35:02] <TurkeyGibby> What'd ya get?
[02:35:15] <fritzwastaken> Daves double with everything
[02:35:18] <TurkeyGibby> I'm considering my options for dinner tonight
[02:35:52] <fritzwastaken> the cheese was at a perfect 45 degree angle from one another, a single big slice of onion and tomato
[02:36:06] <fritzwastaken> perfect square patties
[02:36:23] <fritzwastaken> the lettuce game was on point
[02:36:47] <fritzwastaken> MrsFritz got a JrBaconator no bun and it looked amazing
[02:37:20] <fritzwastaken> I dont normally leave reviews at fast food joints, but they deserve this onew

[04:14:24] <Haise0> modders have done better job at remastering game smh
[04:14:33] <Cl0udNinja> its not 'all'
[04:14:38] <Haise0> models and textures looked much better
[04:14:52] <Cl0udNinja> check the source link and the comments
[04:15:28] <Haise0> hmmm
[04:16:42] <Cl0udNinja> modders keep a lot of games alive and then the game companies go shit all over them
[04:17:25] <Haise0> well majority are but there usually are exceptions
[04:17:34] <Haise0> and on top of that
[04:17:51] <Haise0> modders have done better justice to remastering those games
[04:17:56] <Cl0udNinja> Keen Software (Space Engineers / Medieval Engineers) shit all over both their client bases constantly by either stealing modders mods and putting them into the base game, or charging for new features in the form of dlc every update
[04:18:13] <Cl0udNinja> or doing both
[04:18:16] <Cl0udNinja> stealing a mod and making it dlc
[04:18:17] <Haise0> oh wow that is shitty 
[04:18:31] <Haise0> at least pay a fucking modder
[04:18:39] <Cl0udNinja> afaik they dont
[04:19:09] <Haise0> I know Valve is super friendly with modders iirc 
[04:19:20] <Cl0udNinja> also modders have a hard time in general as it is. mod theft is a big problem
[04:19:41] <Haise0> yep that is a huge problem as well D:
[04:19:54] <Cl0udNinja> someone gets your mod, changes one thing, uploads it claiming it as their own instead of asking the original owner to make changes or uploading it privately
[04:21:02] <Cl0udNinja> shit like nexusmods and the like make it worse too
[04:21:21] <Haise0> I can't remember what was last time I visited Nexusmods
[04:21:29] <Haise0> it was probably early 2021 for Resident Evil 2/3 mods
[04:21:38] <Cl0udNinja> I have recently, for mechwarrior 5, and fallout4
[04:21:55] <Haise0> I get my stuff through workshop or game's own solution
[04:22:24] <Haise0> I know Factorio and AoE 2 DE have own solutions
[04:22:29] <Cl0udNinja> yeah I usually do too, but those mods have fuck all on steam, or are reuploads from nexus
[04:22:38] <Haise0> yeah
[04:22:58] <Haise0> I haven't been modding much lately cause I've been too sucked in MMORPG
[04:23:04] <Haise0> more precisely FFXIV
[04:23:13] <Haise0> game's story pulled me in and I am having a blast
[04:23:15] <Cl0udNinja> I stopped modding because people wouldnt stop complaining about the mod I built the way I wanted it to be
[04:23:35] <Cl0udNinja> and spending more time modding than gaming is pretty sad too
[04:23:53] <Haise0> depends, if its your own way to express your vision that won't cut it as official game content
[04:23:55] <Haise0> then its great
[04:24:19] <Haise0> there are many reasons to mod
[04:24:28] <Cl0udNinja> in particular it was a hazard mechanics mod for space engineers. added heat/cold to systems
[04:24:42] <Haise0> ah so you added extra challenge to gameplay ?
[04:24:43] <Haise0> nice !
[04:24:44] <Cl0udNinja> yea
[04:25:10] <Haise0> if you like being challenged and did that mod for yourself then fucking yolo
[04:25:16] <Cl0udNinja> also added explodey things, like if you damaged your reactor too far or it ran out of control rods it would go boom, or if your hydrogen/oxygen tanks got hit while full
[04:25:16] <Haise0> sounds like something I would throw on
[04:25:52] <Cl0udNinja> was fun messing around and getting critical hits and watching the whole ship just disintegrate
[04:26:09] <Haise0> I messed with Factorio and Resident Evil 3 modding mostly
[04:26:34] <Haise0> I gotta give it to RE3 1999 modders, they used AI to upscale cutscenes and textures and breathe a new life into such a old game
[04:27:01] <Haise0> had a blast playing that on Dolphin Emulator 
[04:27:52] <Cl0udNinja> I could never get into the RE games, I'm not a fan of 3rd person like that
[04:28:03] <Haise0> fixed camera angle ?
[04:28:07] <Haise0> Yeah it can be janky
[04:28:23] <Haise0> I got used to it cause I was interested in story and soundtrack

[08:21:09] <Hunterkll> lol

[08:21:35] <Hunterkll> i don't recall it ever doing that
[08:21:46] <Hunterkll> but it will present you login difficulty if the disk space free is 0 
[08:22:00] <a1> Hunterkll: didn't your desktop BSOD multiple times due to your graphics card?
[08:22:04] <Hunterkll> .... no?
[08:22:23] <Hunterkll> got the same two 1080 Ti's in it as it did when i built it in dec 2017 
[08:22:28] <CoJaBo> Yeh, that's what'd usually happen; they'd always leave like 0 space, Window sUpdate would run, then they couldn't log in anymore til space was freed up
[08:22:40] <CoJaBo> Fun times..
[08:22:43] <Hunterkll> yea but linux will choke on logon too on a truly full disk
[08:22:50] <Hunterkll> so can't exactly say that's just a windows problem
[08:22:58] <CoJaBo> Linux at least has a built-in way to fix it :P
[08:23:01] <Hunterkll> though easier to run out of inodes on linux filesystems....
[08:23:04] <Hunterkll> so does windows 
[08:23:04] <Hunterkll> :P
[08:23:17] <CoJaBo> Unless you're running VirtualBox, then all your data is toast
[08:23:24] <Hunterkll> wut
[08:23:53] <CoJaBo> If you run out of space while VBox is running, it destroys all running VMs
[08:23:58] *** Joins: roro (roro@user/roro)
[08:24:10] <CoJaBo> Guess how I found this out
[08:24:43] <Hunterkll> that..... sounds like something that'd result in inability to write and well, crashed VMs that'd fire up just fine next time.... well, minus you know, fsck and all that 
[08:25:00] <CoJaBo> You can't tho, because all the configs and all disk metadata is gone
[08:25:04] <Hunterkll> i actually need to exapnd my desktop's VM volume because it's full :D
[08:25:35] <a1> some back woods motherfucker is hauling a car down the road with a chain at midnight
[08:25:40] <a1> probably becuase neither fucking car is illegal
[08:25:47] <a1> and it just stalled out on the hill beside my house
[08:26:02] <Cl0udNinja> man this is one fucked up movie
[08:26:10] <CoJaBo> Like Firefox, it doesn't write to them in a crash-safe manner. So when it goes to update the disk, it ruins it. Then it tries to shut down the VM, and erases the VM config file and disk metadata files in the same way.
[08:26:20] <CoJaBo> Then it repeats that for every running VM :/
[08:26:30] <Hunterkll> how's it... gone? Like.... i'm using vhd files and it works just fine...? 
[08:26:47] <Hunterkll> that.... sounds weird
[08:26:59] <Hunterkll> mine just forced them powered off
[08:27:08] <a1> mofo just knocked on my door asking for gas
[08:27:19] <CoJaBo> Hunterkll: AFAICT, it basically deletes the file and tries to create a new one, which fails because there's now not enough space, so everything just gets erased
[08:27:56] <Hunterkll> also, disk metadata.... sounds like something that's not separate 
[08:28:21] <CoJaBo> There was some disk-related stuff that was in a config file; that goes away too
[08:28:35] <Hunterkll> don't need any extra files to take a .vhd or .vdi to another system and attach it to a VM and use it
[08:28:41] <CoJaBo> Might've been for snapshots or something
[08:29:11] <Hunterkll> eh if you have snapshots then the base .vdi/vhd/whatever would just be what was before the snapshot, anything future would be chained differencing disk files 
[08:29:15] <Hunterkll> should be, anyway
[08:29:58] <CoJaBo> Maybe I'm misremembering, but I could swear there is a config file that tells VBox which of those differencing files to use. That got blown away; there were no disks left to recover from, just raw files
[08:30:09] <Hunterkll> well, you'd still have the base disk
[08:30:18] <Hunterkll> and then i suppose you'd have to manually chain the differencing disks 
[08:30:27] <Hunterkll> i've had to do that for ESX and Hyper-V before

[08:31:44] <CoJaBo> I've had clients lose data in some of the wildest ways, but I can't remember ever seeing that before =D
[08:32:00] <Hunterkll> they were moving the VM to a new host or something on shared storage
[08:32:05] <Hunterkll> and it was like a 3TB base vhdx 
[08:32:11] <Hunterkll> for a file server
[08:32:20] <Hunterkll> so they didn't have the space to make a copy, so just mounted it in a new VM on the new host 
[08:32:31] <Hunterkll> and were like "huh wtf data is gone"
[08:32:45] <Hunterkll> i was like "okay just run this powershell etc..... you still have the original untouched vhdx right?" 
[08:32:47] <Hunterkll> *crickets*
[08:32:57] <Hunterkll> ahhhh yea you lost data sorry buds
[08:33:48] <CoJaBo> "So we can send this to a lab, it's gonna cost you your first and second born and we probably won't get everything and might not get much of anything at all; or we can just call this a lesson in backups as you start over from scratch"
[08:33:54] <Hunterkll> nope
[08:33:57] <Hunterkll> not even worth it
[08:34:02] <Hunterkll> differencing disks are block level changes
[08:34:17] <Hunterkll> CoJaBo: heh part of the move was to fix backups
[08:34:17] <Hunterkll> :D
[08:34:57] <CoJaBo> A good lab can reconstruct those and likely get some data. It's just a matter of how much money you want to pour into the pit.
[08:35:14] <Hunterkll> eh not quite
[08:35:59] <Hunterkll> if you have blocks A B C D with A C in differencing file, and you change C on the underlying, the differencing is now totally invalid
[08:36:13] <Hunterkll> because data has shifted around/defrag occured/etc 
[08:36:23] <Hunterkll> and they were kicking that VM around for a *while*
[08:36:35] <Hunterkll> so a file that may have had a bit on sector C could be entirely on sector Z now 
[08:36:45] <Hunterkll> so what's inthe differencing disk might as well be pure cryptographic nonsense
[08:36:54] <CoJaBo> Yeh, if your file is split across base and diff, that's gone. What (should be) recoverable is wholly new files.
[08:37:14] <Hunterkll> *potentially* however when you're talking 50+ AVHDX's .....
[08:37:30] <Hunterkll> and lots of large files  that are constantly modified, not much in the way of new creation....

[08:45:47] <CoJaBo> I forget the exact configuration, but they basically had 2 disks, each partitioned into halves. First partition on each disk was striped with the other, second partition was mirrored with the other, and then the resulting RAID-0 and RAID-1 volumes were striped together into a RAID-R

[13:34:06] <Hunterkll> i regret selling my OG xbox
[13:34:16] <Hunterkll> when that thing was relevant i dumped like $700 worth of mods into it 
[13:34:58] <sd> 05<N​ick1296> I own two because my neighbor was selling them cheap. One has never been worked on, but the other needed a DVD drive. He's dead now, so I like to think he knows they ended up in the right place.

[13:39:28] <sd> 05<N​ick1296> I'd like the pirate favorite Samsung drive, but those are hard to get.
[13:39:32] <Hunterkll> had the clear case, frosted front panel with builtin USB ports, XIR, bank select switches, XLCD, 150GB HDD (or was it 300?), X3 modchip, etc
[13:40:13] <sd> 05<N​ick1296> Yeah I didn't get the Samsung piracy drive, but the Xboxes ended up in a good home it seen a repair.
[13:40:30] <Hunterkll> i have no idea what drive was in mine
[13:40:33] <Hunterkll> and rightly didn't care
[13:40:43] <Hunterkll> i was either FTPing over games or just ripping them from legit discs
[13:40:59] <sd> 05<N​ick1296> The Phillips drive is less then ideal for "backups" of "legal copies".
[13:41:14] <Hunterkll> well, whatever it was, it worked a treat

[13:42:09] <sd> 05<N​ick1296> I had to lie to my dad about what Limewire is for

[14:35:51] <Kiernian> Lots of threats of physical violence were issued that probably wouldn't fly with HR now 15 years later and the intern spent a few days uninstalling cracked software and installing the licensed stuff.

[16:29:29] <Roughy> Sir, do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior no-poo?
[16:30:04] <A-KO> yeah nah
[16:30:08] <Roughy> When you strip all the oils from your head/hair everyday, the body compensats by overproducing more oil, resulting in nasty, oily hair. 
[16:30:14] <A-KO> I need to shampoo daily or else my head gets disgusting
[16:30:19] <A-KO> yeah uh
[16:30:20] <Haise0> A-KO: what the fuck, that is actually disgusting (I'm European myself lol)
[16:30:23] <Roughy> Stop using shampoo, or stick to using it once a week or so
[16:30:30] <A-KO> that doesn't work for me Roughy lol

[16:30:52] <Haise0> oh wow lol
[16:30:54] <Haise0> I shampoo my hair on daily basis
[16:30:56] <csws> your hair will be a little less oily when shampoo'd but it's not that much difference
[16:30:56] <Roughy> it does take a month or two for the oil production to calm down, so going no-poo is a a bit of a challenge
[16:30:57] <A-KO> "few weeks"--of utter hell from dandruff, etc.
[16:30:59] <csws> shampoo is kind of a scam

[16:31:27] <A-KO> so f that noise
[16:31:29] <A-KO> shampoo all the way lol

[16:31:36] <csws> I get tonnes of beard dandruff :(
[16:31:41] <Haise0> I hate when it starts itching grrr
[16:31:56] <csws> yeah well nowadays I use shampoo so my hair doesn't look weird lol
[16:31:59] <A-KO> I have yet to figure out how to deal with my beard dandruff other than keeping up with washing and conditioning. And even then it's not perfect.
[16:32:04] <Roughy> you, sir, need a medicated ketoconazolum shampoo
[16:32:16] <Haise0> A-KO: I also shave every 3-4 days lol
[16:32:21] <csws> Roughy, what about coal tar?
[16:32:24] <Roughy> constant dandruff and itching skalp is not normal.
[16:32:25] <Haise0> I don't like having beard
[16:32:35] <csws> I swapped to coal tar after head & shoulders started fucking my scalp up
[16:32:38] <csws> been good
[16:32:40] <A-KO> I used to shave, but then I grew a beard and women began complimenting me so I kept it
[16:32:51] <Haise0> oh wow lol
[16:33:00] <csws> lol if I shave properly I end up looking like a child :(

[18:30:33] <nobyk> weird creatures
[18:30:35] <Hunterkll> each game except for XV basically stands on its own
[18:30:36] <nobyk> just random stuff
[18:30:44] <Hunterkll> but they have references to each other, common themes of types of stuff
[18:30:50] <Hunterkll> but really they're all standalone games with some interrelated stuff
[18:30:57] <Hunterkll> XV is a huge fanservice circlejerk though 
[18:31:08] <Hunterkll> which was pretty fun, but you'd have to have played one or two of the other ones at a minimum to really get it
[18:31:18] <Hunterkll> unlike all the others, even the MMOs, which you can pick up without having touched any other one
[18:32:17] <Hunterkll> like you know, there will be common themes shared amongst them, like a guy named Cid always being some kind of inventor/mechanic/etc, or black mages always having dopey pointed hats 
[18:33:20] <Hunterkll> but in the end, each game is its own standalone story/universe
[18:33:40] <Hunterkll> and then sometimes you get drunk and spend $1k on a doll
[18:33:51] <nobyk> lol
[18:34:10] <nobyk> You did.. didn't you
[18:34:14] <Hunterkll> of course
[18:34:21] <Hunterkll> because i know how much those things fucking skyrocket in price 
[18:34:24] <Hunterkll> especially from this specific company 
[18:34:27] <nobyk> yeah yeah

[18:34:47] <nobyk> hahahaha
[18:34:56] <Hunterkll> i'd have to be REALLY drunk to do that
[18:35:04] <Hunterkll> though, oddly enough, that doesn't really impact values as much as you 'd think
[18:35:15] <Hunterkll> some of the used ones that were $500 initially are like $16k now for ones that were released only like 3-4 years ago
[18:35:55] <Hunterkll> it's one of those "all hand made, limited order window" type deals
[18:36:08] <Hunterkll> this one's actually kind of unique in how widespread possible distribution is 
[18:36:14] <nobyk> Man.. half way through the act with a doll, something has to hit you right? And make you reflect on what you're doing

[20:12:36] <Hunterkll> oh
[20:12:46] <Hunterkll> Haise0: well, pulling directly from MS means that the machines hit the WAN directly
[20:12:54] <Hunterkll> you need a deployment package to distribute from your SCCM instance itself

[22:00:07] <Hunterkll> etc
[22:00:29] <Hunterkll> basically you install using the "cd.latest" from the failed SCCM server and remount the database

[22:01:18] <Hunterkll> is backs up the cd.latest, the database, and a few other things you might need
[22:01:26] <Hunterkll> and you basically stand up all new shit and reinstall/remount database

[22:09:25] <Hunterkll> also
[22:09:32] <Hunterkll> I want to know what the FUCK led to this
[22:09:33] <Hunterkll> Running Exchange on a clustered node that's also an Active Directory domain controller isn't supported.

[23:05:34] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Thats right, house flies can see behind them and it’s all to do with their amazing eyes! Unlike human beings, house flies have compound eyes. These intricate eyes provided them with nearly a 360-degree field of view, which allows them to see behind themselves. Unlike ours, the eyes of a house fly dont move. Being able to see in all directions allows them to navigate while also being on the lookout for danger.

[23:25:30] <Hunterkll> both
[23:25:32] <Activ8> It took a week for our 5 site setup it was done extremely slowing including a 365 page documentation on it's setup
[23:25:37] <Hunterkll> you say something dumb someone might take it as gospel 
[23:25:42] <Activ8> that included 1 app server on each site

[23:25:57] <Hunterkll> :D
[23:26:07] <Activ8> that's pretty good
[23:26:15] <Hunterkll> this is SCOM, not SCCM
[23:26:20] <Hunterkll> so a tad more convoluted

[23:30:28] <Haise0> Hunterkll: oh, got it
[23:30:46] <Haise0> well most I'm gonna do with System Center is SCVMM, SCOM and SCCM lol
[23:31:09] <Hunterkll> SCSM is helpdesk ticketing software, CMDB, etc
[23:31:55] <Activ8> we moved over from support desk to scsm
