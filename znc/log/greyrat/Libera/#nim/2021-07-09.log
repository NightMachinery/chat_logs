[05:02:40] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> Afterall the way this presently works is nimscript calls nim to convert the data into a string
[05:08:58] <FromDiscord> <Bung> so this will not get quick fixed ?
[05:09:26] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> Well the serializer needs to handle case objects
[05:09:53] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> I'm first going to rewrite the macros since they're more concerning to me, then go to the serializer since i want try to put more thought into it
[05:10:16] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> A big issue is that the VM cannot use frosty/flatty directly due to using low level operations
[05:15:30] <FromDiscord> <Bung> ok, maybe I need find another solution, after dll and nimscripter.
[05:15:47] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> What was the issue with the dll, GC'd memory?
[05:17:31] <FromDiscord> <Bung> depends how program compiled , some case returns nil when dll proc returns ref T, some case get nil access in dll proc's loop
[05:18:21] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> Well you're using refs across program barriers that's bound to cause issues if you dont care for it
[05:20:55] <FromDiscord> <Bung> so the easy solution maybe still use dll gen way, using a pragma transform return type to object T
[05:21:40] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> Probably

[11:05:18] <FromDiscord> <Varriount> @dom96 Is there a way to download an archive of all #nim's IRC logs? Other than manually crawling the website?
[11:21:47] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> In reply to @Yardanico "updated sqlite db of": @Varriount yardanico has a sqlite db with all messages, but it is not frequently updated
[11:23:19] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> In reply to @ajusa "I asked something similar": You can write a macro that would do all the lifting for your - you would only need to write a mapping
[11:25:23] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> I think you don't even need to have a DSL, just accept `static[openarray[tuple[inPair: (BoxKind, BoxKind), outRes: BoxKind]]` and write `liftImpl({(kindInt, kindInt): kindInt})`
[11:26:04] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> At least I think you can do static openarray, otherwise `@{ ... }` will give you static tuple
[11:26:53] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> I'd you don't want to hardcode all kind -> field mappings in the implementation you can also accept `static[array[BoxKind, string]]` mapping
[11:28:00] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> So for variant types it is mostly correct approach, but it does add some boilerplate, so having lift macro would be important
[11:28:56] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Actually you can lift any n-ary procedure if you use `seq[BoxKind]` and unpack fields
[11:29:12] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Not just operators
[11:30:29] <FromDiscord> <Stuffe> Is there a way to define global scope constants that can be used to compile different versions, like: when defined(release)

[22:06:41] <FromDiscord> <vindaar> @System64 ~ Flandre Scarlet\: what do you actually need?
[22:07:24] <FromDiscord> <System64 ~ Flandre Scarlet> I need to output audio
[22:07:50] <FromDiscord> <System64 ~ Flandre Scarlet> but ``discard gmePlay(cast[ptr MusicEmu](userdata), 1024.cint,cast[ptr cshort](outputBuffer)) `` fills a buffer
[22:19:02] <FromDiscord> <System64 ~ Flandre Scarlet> What should I do?
[22:23:16] <FromDiscord> <vindaar> I'm not an audio person. There's probably easy ways to play audio that are available on windows. But I'm no help here \:/
[22:27:40] <FromDiscord> <System64 ~ Flandre Scarlet> In reply to @vindaar "maybe use this one?": And the weird thing is it seems it doesn't interact with a dll
[22:28:28] <FromDiscord> <System64 ~ Flandre Scarlet> but maybe I got wrong
[22:52:52] <FromDiscord> <System64 ~ Flandre Scarlet> Where does it search the lib? https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/371759389889003532/863123048584183838/unknown.png

[23:51:31] <FromDiscord> <@bracketmaster-5a708063d73408ce4> and then perhaps echo that address?
