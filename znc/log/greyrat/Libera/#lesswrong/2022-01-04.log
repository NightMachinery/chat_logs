[00:00:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> That Bastiat quote seems a bit too glib for me
[00:01:54] <Obormot\Gaia> And I say this as someone who for sure opposes state-imposed equality, state-imposed education, state-imposed religion...
[00:03:24] <Obormot\Gaia> But Bastiat is unfair to his socialists, I think. There's a "missing" inferential step there, it's true: namely, the assumption that in the case religion, equality, and education - and NOT, crucially, in the case of the raising of grain! - if the state does not do the thing, then it will not be done

[00:04:04] <Obormot\Gaia> But what is wrong with that? You can disagree with the claim, surely, but then you actually have to disagree with it, not just dismiss as invalid the logic that rests on it...
[00:05:41] <Obormot\Gaia> To Bastiat's socialists, presumably, the assumption seemed natural. Their mistake, we could say, was not in their policy conclusions but rather in their modeling of their opponents: "you surely agree with my facts (because they are obvious), therefore to disagree with my policy proposals, you must hold values contrary to mine" - which misses the possibility of disagreeing on facts
[00:06:46] <Obormot\Gaia> This is an error, sure, but it's hard to blame someone for if they truly see the facts as obvious...
[00:08:13] <Obormot\Gaia> And, quite relevantly to that point, can we really say that the accusation is false even in all the given cases? Ok, with religion - absurd, of course there can be non-state religion. Education - arguable but one hardly has to be an idiot or a madman to disagree. But equality?
[00:09:23] <Obormot\Gaia> "If you don't want state-enforced equality, then you must not want equality" - well... yes? Is this a false charge? The people on Bastiat's side would say "equality [of outcomes] is somewhere between 'impossible' and 'possible but only by turning society into a dystopia', so we shouldn't try for it" - right?
[00:09:40] <Obormot\Gaia> How can you have equality of outcomes without the state enforcing it?
[00:11:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or, from the other quote:
[00:12:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> "When we oppose subsidies, we are charged with opposing the very thing that it was proposed to subsidize and of being the enemies of all kinds of activity, because we want these activities to be voluntary and to seek their proper reward in themselves. ... If we think that the state should not subsidize artists, we are barbarians who judge the arts useless." ... but how unjust an accusation is this, really? Are there not in
[00:12:23] <Obormot\Arcturus>  fact all kinds of things that woudln't exist if they weren't subsidized?
[00:13:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Bastiat, for his point to go through, has to either deny that such a category exists, or, perhaps, claim that its members are only things that no one wants
[00:15:58] *** Quits: two2thehead (~user@27.114.133.163) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:16:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> The *empirically* defensible stance is something like: "We should not subsidize X. Without subsidies, X will exist only to the extent that individuals voluntarily choose to support it - and that is the appropriate amount of X. If it turns out that individuals will not, and cannot be persuaded to, voluntarily support X, and X thus vanishes, then this is good, and there should be no X."
[00:17:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is unassailable in its internal logic, but is Bastiat actually prepared to defend that stance? Is anyone else? Ok, some economists will go for it, but - who will be convinced by it?
[00:22:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> (It's akin to the maximally-simple “revealed preferences" view, where we can ask something like "are people's preferences being adequately satisfied by [our society / modernity / capitalism / whatever]" and get back the answer "by definition they are, because there are no 'preferences' but revealed preferences, and since 'revealed preferences' just means 'what people in fact do', it follows that everyone's preferences are
[00:22:07] <Obormot\Arcturus>  maximally satisfied at all times" - somehow one can't help feeling cheated by a reply like this)

[00:25:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... top 10%? Is that an intentional troll?
[00:25:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Doesn't that include, like, all of America?
[00:25:22] <pompolic> what's the jok-- oh
[00:25:22] <spxtr> if it were something like top 0.1% I would say yes for sure
[00:25:25] <spxtr> 10% is way too high
[00:25:35] <pompolic> innumeracy strikes again
[00:25:39] <ggreer> top 0.1% is people making over $100k
[00:25:50] <spxtr> jeez even that is less income than I expected
[00:25:56] <spxtr> the world is poor, evidently
[00:26:00] <pompolic> i will commit this factoid to memory
[00:26:05] <dTal> that's a stupid idea
[00:26:07] <pompolic> so that i can say "you first"
[00:26:21] <dTal> so if you're in the 11th percentile, suddenly you're the new 1%
[00:26:25] <dTal> genius, problem solved
[00:26:38] <dTal> it's like firing everyone who performs below average
[00:26:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: So my brain glosses over the numbers at a first very quick skim, and before I looked at said numbers I intuitively assumed that this was about, indeed, something like "top 0.1%", in which case my reply would be something like "I would be tempted by this EXCEPT for the 'according to need' part, that torpedoes it entirely"
[00:27:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: (Of course this turned out to be moot because the actual number, 10%, makes the proposition radically absurd for unrelated reasons)
[00:27:24] <spxtr> yeah "according to need" I'm going to need waaaay more details on how that works
[00:27:24] * pompolic self-modifies into a utility monster

[00:28:17] <kuudes> if we want to reduce inequality internationally, we should move money from people who earn about 1000$/mo to people who earn about 100$/mo
[00:28:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Inequality of what, though
[00:28:58] <kuudes> income or consumption
[00:29:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> "how many dollars of assets you have, calculated in a very naive way"?
[00:29:14] <kuudes> oh, and wealth matters very little
[00:29:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because that's the only thing that's gonna be eqaulized by moving money around like that
[00:29:21] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: he's guilty of the exact same logical error he accuses socialists of. if the people wanted libertarianism they would already be libertarian without bastiat or the state ever getting involved
[00:29:22] <kuudes> income matters, wealth not so much
[00:29:38] <spxtr> Obormot\Arcturus: that's probably true. I'd prefer something more like "distributed equally" or "distributed according to X organization's research" a la givewell sort of thing
[00:29:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: True!
[00:30:04] <kuudes> personally I am for having everyone getting at least 60% of median of those who get more than themself
[00:30:14] <kuudes> that removes absolute and relative poverty
[00:30:14] <spxtr> also instead of a hard cutoff at 10% or whatever you'd need to do a tax bracket sort of thing, otherwise people cheat to fall at exactly 9.9%
[00:30:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Well, maybe true. It could be a coordination problem, surely; everyone wants libertarianism, but we can't coordinate to impose it on everyone
[00:30:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: (Possibly because we're all too libertarian to stomach that - what a twist!)
[00:30:40] <rsaarelm> So what's the annual income cutoff for top 10 % globally?
[00:30:55] <kuudes> thats top 800M persons
[00:31:07] <kuudes> so USA+EU are 330M+450 = 780M persons
[00:31:28] <kuudes> something like top 80% of EU maybe if we include japan and other asian developed locales
[00:31:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: Yeah, I mean, this is the point where the conversation becomes too many levels of mootness for me, honestly; distributivism is a nonstarter for so many reasons that discussing how precisely to do it is... I don't even know, "a waste of breath" seems too charitable
[00:31:58] <kuudes> I would guess some thousands per month maybe? could be less
[00:32:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: (Of course that logic itself undermines libertarianism...)
[00:32:48] <spxtr> Obormot\Arcturus: well without redistributing the money you are simply removing it from rich people and giving nothing back to the world in return
[00:32:58] <spxtr> I'm a fan of smiting the rich, but that seems a bit harsh even to me

[00:38:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> "If 90th percentile is like $60,000 then this seems not true? Like $6,000 / year makes you very poor but you don't literally starve to death"
[00:38:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ah yes, 6,000, which is 1% of 60,000, ... wait a minute
[00:38:57] <pompolic> Obormot\Arcturus: I'm curious what your strongest argument in favor of wealth destruction is
[00:39:44] <kuudes> ... wait, why should wealth be destroyed?
[00:39:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: Uh, hard to answer that because by "wealth destruction" I don't mean some unitary and broad policy, I mean it as a specific approach/option in specific cases
[00:39:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> I will give an example
[00:39:59] <pompolic> oh, i think i can kind of see what you mean then
[00:40:10] <pompolic> examples appreciated though
[00:42:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Suppose that someone in our quiet residential neighborhood is disturbing the peace by blasting his massively amplified car stereo all the time while exceeding the speed limit by 30mph. He is duly arrested (and, one hopes, caned in public, like in Singapore, or some such thing). His car, meanwhile, is confiscated as part of his punishment.
[00:42:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> What should be done with said vehicle?
[00:42:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> The current policy of every government I know of is "appropriate it, then sell it or otherwise turn into funds"
[00:42:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is a bad policy.
[00:43:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> It creates terrible incentives! (No elaboration needed, I think, but if necessary I'll just say "asset forfeiture" and that should suffice)
[00:43:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> The correct policy is to destroy it.
[00:43:43] <pompolic> yep
[00:44:06] <spxtr> don't the bad incentives only show up if the police are profiting from it? if they were to donate it then would there be an issue?
[00:44:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: Of course there would be an issue; if you can't think of ways for that to happen, then you either lack imagination or are hopelessly naive - I doubt both
[00:44:59] <pompolic> spxtr: i think that would give incentive to recipients of donations to frame people
[00:45:04] <saturn2> massively amplified car stereos should not be sold because they should not exist
[00:45:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Of course I agree with you but that's hardly the point
[00:45:38] <spxtr> amplifiers can be removed
[00:45:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also true and also irrelevant
[00:46:09] <spxtr> you can argue that any donation service would lead to manipulation and abuse and so on
[00:46:19] <pompolic> i will now spin up a startup to create anti-speakers that project silence
[00:47:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: Another, and more general example, of the principle, is fines of any sort
[00:47:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Fines for littering, for jaywalking, etc.
[00:47:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> What should be done with the money?
[00:48:11] <saturn2> they could also auction it off and burn the money, that would be preferable since money is imaginary but cars are real

[00:48:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> If the municipal government gets to keep it, then they'll obviously impose nuisance fines (passing new laws, or stepping up enforcement of old ones) to raise revenue... we see this all the time
[00:48:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Instead the fines should be collected and then the money destroyed
[00:49:21] <spxtr> I agree that as long as the money is not destroyed then there will be an incentive for abuse. I guess I'm not quite cynical enough to assert that there will always be abuse.
[00:49:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: I disagree that it would be preferable, because they just incentivizes them to funnel the cars or whatever else to whoever needs to receive some kickback or bonus etc.

[00:51:33] <saturn2> impose*
[00:52:38] <ggreer> I wonder if cops are less likely to enforce nuisance laws after may of 2020, because every contact with some asshole is a chance they'll resist, somehow die, and then your city is ruined by riots

[01:39:46] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: my question is why there's this separate realm of incentives where everyone behaves amorally versus rules where everyone behaves morally. isn't it more like moral people are moral all the time and immoral people are immoral whenever moral people let them get away with it?
[01:40:56] <saturn2> if there's a rule that says you have to behave amorally whenever there's an "incentive" involved, can we just get rid of that rule?
[01:44:45] <Obormot\Gaia> saturn2: I don't know what you mean by this... people behave according to their incentives, and also follow "moral rules" to whatever extent (can they also be modeled as incentives? who knows, maybe, maybe not) - what separate realm is there?
[01:46:18] <Obormot\Gaia> Your question before seems akin to "if we can't stop people from driving too slow, how can we stop people from driving too fast" - to which the answer is "we certainly do the latter imperfectly, but we do it, and the reason we can do the former and not the latter is that the latter is illegal while the former is legal"...
[01:47:13] <Obormot\Gaia> Could we make a law to prevent driving too slowly? Perhaps we could, but none curently exists [if it does where you live then pretend you're in one of the places where this isn't the case]
[01:47:54] <Obormot\Gaia> Similarly, "why can't we stop municipal governments from imposing nuisance fines" - we'd have to pass a law to prevent it, somehow. Could we? Maybe, maybe not. In fact have we? No, obviously
[01:47:55] <saturn2> if there's some force that stops people from murdering everyone and stealing everything all the time, why can't it also stop people from imposing ever more bullshit fines or giving kickbacks to their friends
[01:48:48] <Obormot\Gaia> Murdering is illegal and stealin is also illegal
[01:48:56] <Obormot\Gaia> Imposing bullshit fines is not illegal
[01:48:57] <janus__> Citation please?
[01:49:15] <janus__> I just murdered. Am I going to get in trouble for that?
[01:49:32] <Obormot\Gaia> You could of course ask more subtle questions than that, but if you don't acknowledge that basic fact then I don't know what you're asking
[01:49:36] <saturn2> and laws are just pieces of paper...
[01:49:36] <PlanckWalk> Regarding "last and only time I had sex after my vasectomy reversal was one month before her miscarriage. The fetus she miscarried was six weeks old":  fetal age is measured from ast period, not from conception.
[01:49:42] <PlanckWalk> last* period
[01:49:57] <PlanckWalk> Often date of conception is impossible to determine
[01:50:35] <PlanckWalk> (If date of last period is also unknown, it's guessed)
[01:50:56] <Obormot\Gaia> saturn2: That's relevant if you ask "how can people sometimes do illegal things anyway" but it's not relevant to the question "why are people doing this legal thing"
[01:51:32] <Obormot\Gaia> "Why do people sometimes eat ice cream, even though laws are just pieces of paper" is clearly a non sequitur - what do laws have to do with it?
[01:51:39] <Obormot\Gaia> Ditto for "imposing bullshit fines"
[01:52:53] <Obormot\Gaia> PlanckWalk: That is irrelevant if the conception predates the sex...
[01:53:25] <Obormot\Gaia> PlanckWalk: No amount of variation in how long conception or implantation etc. takes can cause sperm to travel back in time
[01:55:28] <Obormot\Gaia> PlanckWalk: Hm, never mind, I see what you're saying
[01:55:35] <Obormot\Gaia> But is it true?
[01:56:05] <janus__> Citation please? I was conceived by my son when he traveled back in time and had sex with my mother. (ok, sorry, no more).

[01:57:02] <janus__> Are there health implications of large differences between conception and 'fetal age' defined from the last period?
[01:57:04] <catern> why would you ask all us zombies for citations anyway
[01:57:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: The internet tells us that there are various more accurate ways of determining fetal age, e.g. ultrasound
[01:57:50] <saturn2> eating ice cream is not analogous because ice cream eating doesn't cause a problem for anyone
[01:58:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: What if I'm Leon Kass
[01:58:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> But more seriously, I don't see how that does anything to the analogy
[01:59:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> On the other hand, if you insist, we could give other examples! What if I call random people assholes while walking down the street
[01:59:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> What if I park in such a way as to take up more space along the curb
[02:00:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> What if I run my vacuum cleaner for hours a day in my apartment
[02:00:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> None of these things are illegal, all of them cause problems for people

[02:02:01] <nshepperd2> that seems weird
[02:02:03] <PlanckWalk> Well, I suppose it's possible that might be different in some other places. It's the standard practice here in Australia.
[02:02:14] <nshepperd2> why would they randomly redefine fetal age to make it less pecise
[02:02:20] <saturn2> in the former two cases, you probably get away with it because of your anonymity. with the vacuum cleaner i would also wonder why your neighbors were unable to come up with a way to get you to stop
[02:02:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: That doesn't seem to be the case, according to my searching
[02:02:31] <PlanckWalk> It was always defined in terms of time since last period, for hundreds of years
[02:02:45] <PlanckWalk> It didn't get redefined in the last few decades, is all.
[02:02:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> The interwebs disagree with you :\
[02:03:15] <PlanckWalk> My two midwife parents disagree with the interwebs.
[02:03:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: I guess I'm not sure what the puzzle here is. Some things are illegal. If people generally do not do those things, that is to be expected and is not puzzling. Other things are legal. If people do those things and don't avoid doing them, that is also not puzzling.
[02:04:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: I'll take the internet over midwives :p
[02:04:51] <PlanckWalk> Sure.  Just letting you know that this is a standard practice.
[02:05:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh I just noticed you said Australia
[02:05:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> That might be why
[02:05:28] <PlanckWalk> And so a two-week difference between "date of sex" and "reported age of miscarried fetus" is not automatically proof of nonpaternity.
[02:06:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Americans tend to favor "medical procedures", broadly speaking, more so than people in most other places
[02:08:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: To put it another way: are you going to claim that there exist zero behaviors or actions that are (a) problematic for other people, and (b) not illegal? Gonna guess the answer's "no"... and are there things that are illegal, but that people would like to do if they weren't illegal, but that people in fact mostly don't do, because they're illegal? I think we can say "yes" to that one...
[02:08:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> I dunno, I just don't see anything to explain here

[02:10:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Bottom line, yes we could in theory make a law against nuisance fines, and we could also make a law that says confiscated money has to be burned, and those would both be "solutions" to "the problem", kind of, but one of them is much easier to pass and enforce than the other
[02:12:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> The latter is not meaningfully different from the kind of regulation on police procedure that currently exists and is ubiquitous, while the former is ... difficult even to imagine formulating in concrete terms, much less to imagine actually putting into place
[02:15:05] <PlanckWalk> Err, it seems to me that the former is more common
[02:15:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> (By the way, as far as the vacuum cleaner example, well, *empirically* it is the case that people sometimes, even often, do things like this, and are not in fact stopped, so whatever your theory or model of human behavior says, it must be able to explain this undeniable fact - if you find it surprising then your model has gaps, clearly!)
[02:16:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: Uh... laws against municipal governments imposing nuisance fines are more common than police regulations about how confiscated property should be handled?
[02:16:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gonna have to press the doubt button on that one
[02:19:24] <saturn2> i don't really think laws have much influence on peoples behavior
[02:21:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Either you mean that in a very circumscribed fashion or it's clearly false
[02:21:23] <saturn2> there are some laws that people break all the time because they don't consider it wrong, and other laws that people generally follow even in the remote wilderness or at sea with no plausible way for law enforcement to find out about it

[02:22:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Both of those things are true and yet that does not in any way rule out the existence of laws which people follow only when they're in fact in place and enforced
[02:22:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of which there are many
[02:22:20] <nshepperd2> i think a law that police have to destroy collected fines would probably result in that happening
[02:22:35] <saturn2> i agree
[02:24:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway bbl
[02:29:29] <saturn2> is it possible to imagine two police officers, both of whom follow every law to the letter, yet one is a bad police officer who accosts random people and makes them pay fines, and the other is a good police officer who stops insane murderers?
[02:30:12] <Betawolf> I can't imagine a person who follows every law to the letter being as functional as either of those two.
[02:36:15] <PlanckWalk> Obormot\Arcturus: Not neceaarily *laws* as in acts of parliament preventing issuance of nuisance fines, but regulations that prevent their misuse (with the authority for the regulations deriving from laws)
[02:37:16] <PlanckWalk> Laws that say that money collected should be burned are common?  Not in my experience
[02:38:01] <Gurkenglas> better PR if instead of burned you say "goes into national tax pool"
[02:38:20] <Gurkenglas> or are there also corruptible incentived people there
[02:38:22] <PlanckWalk> Yes, going into general revenue is very common
[02:38:49] <PlanckWalk> Sometimes specifically to particular department revenues (like highway funds)
[02:40:40] <PlanckWalk> The incentives can be very different yes
[02:41:05] <saturn2> whoever receives the revenue gets an incentive to increase it
[02:41:14] <Betawolf> Seized funds going into local budgets is a great way to get corrupt officials.
[02:41:43] <PlanckWalk> E.g. even going into national general revenue, it depends upon how it's accounted internally.  E.g. does it internally offset budget expenses for police?
[02:46:03] <PlanckWalk> saturn2: That's fine if those who receive it don't have much *power* to increase it.
[02:48:03] <saturn2> ok, so the money should be given to whoever has the least amount of power
[02:49:10] <PlanckWalk> Sounds ... not terrible, but not exactly what I was talking about
[02:49:32] <PlanckWalk> Power in general doesn't matter, just power to increase collection rates.
[02:50:08] <saturn2> i'd tend to assume those are very highly correlated
[02:50:53] <PlanckWalk> Individual police officers have very little "power in general", especially when compared to say Elon Musk
[02:51:05] <PlanckWalk> But they have a great amount of power to increase collection rates.
[02:51:41] <Betawolf> maybe all seized assets should go to Elon Musk, as he is the one person who least cares about it
[02:52:26] <PlanckWalk> Or for that matter the Tax Office has quite a bit of power, but much less in particular for increasing such collection rates.
[02:55:22] <Gurkenglas> you don't want to incentivize people to win the powerlessness contest
[02:55:31] <PlanckWalk> If Officer Plod directly receives the proceeds of all the fines, even if Officer Plod has no other power whatsoever, that's much worse than giving it to nearly anyone else.
[03:00:51] <PlanckWalk> Giving it to Plod's superior is probably next worst.  They have the power to get Plod to collect more.
[03:01:33] <PlanckWalk> Passing it through the tax office to general revenue is pretty far removed from the power to get officers to collect more.
[03:02:18] <PlanckWalk> Sure, "the government as a whole" has some power in that respect, and internal incentives can concentrate that back down to Plod.
[03:02:25] <saturn2> in pakistan, the police will just show up and accuse you of a random crime in expectation of receiving a bribe. if you don't pay up, you go to jail. in the united states, this is extremely rare. yet both countries have similar laws against police bribery, so it can't be laws that explain the difference

Ahn's father stated that the decision was due to lack of support from the South Korean skating association.[28] Prior to moving to Russia, Ahn did not know the Russian language and had no familial ties to Russia. He had considered competing for the United States, but found that the process for gaining Russian citizenship
[05:02:21] <Obormot\Arcturus>  was much easier. He chose "Viktor" as his Russian name as it derived from Victory,[29] and to pay tribute to Viktor Tsoi, a Soviet rock star of ethnic Korean descent.[30]"

[05:21:01] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: is there an intuition for this trick? it looks kinda arbitrary

[05:21:32] <gwern> diffusion
[05:22:12] <RiversHaveWings> diffusion specifically or classifier-free guidance?
[05:23:40] <gwern> latter
[05:24:18] * gwern has made his peace with diffusion models by interpreting them as 'edits'
[05:24:29] <RiversHaveWings> it's the same thing as the classifier scale from https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05233.pdf

[05:24:56] <RiversHaveWings> section 4.3
[05:25:48] <gwern> (you can link sections, you know)
[05:25:59] <RiversHaveWings> like if you have a model for p(class|image)
[05:26:18] <RiversHaveWings> you can guide an unconditional diffusion process with it.
[05:26:33] <gwern> well, it's not the same thing, they're pretty adamant. they're all about avoiding needing to use the gradient to hack the classification probability
[05:27:04] <gwern> 'In initial experiments with unconditional ImageNet models, we found it necessary to scale the classifier gradients by a constant factor larger than 1. When using a scale of 1, we observed that the classifier assigned reasonable probabilities (around 50%) to the desired classes for the final samples, but these samples did not match the intended classes upon visual inspection' <-- I assume...
[05:27:07] <RiversHaveWings> and so the rescaled distribution for classifier scales != 1 is p(class|image)^s, with the appropriate normalizing constant
[05:27:10] <gwern> ...that's why they talk about the adversarialness
[05:27:31] <RiversHaveWings> (You do not actually need to compute the normalizing constant)
[05:30:21] <RiversHaveWings> gwern: if you have the gradient of log p(image) and the gradient of log p(image|class), you can separate out the gradient of log p(class|image) with Bayes' theorem.

[05:31:18] <phill> "The high-density lipoprotein/ low-density lipoprotein ratio dropped" should be the ldl/hdl I'm pretty sure
[05:32:37] <RiversHaveWings> Now if you have a conditional diffusion model trained w/ the condition randomly dropped out, then the model output w/ the null condition is the grad log p(image) and the model output w/ the specified condition is grad log p(image|class).

[06:37:41] <feepbot> <gwern> 'One concrete example: I know a general contractor who was working on several houses in Argentina in 1989, a year when the peso saw 5,000% inflation. That year, he made the unpleasant discovery that his clients paid late much more often than usual. They always had excuses: "Ah sorry, I forgot to pay before I went on vacation. I'll pay you when I'm back!" When you're seeing
[06:37:41] <feepbot> 40% inflation per month, delaying payment by a week is effectively a 10% discount. Awfully convenient to be out of town the week you're supposed to pay! Ever since learning this lesson the hard way, the contractor has always denominated his prices in USD.'
[06:40:18] <Obormot\Gaia> Hmm... how does that work exactly?
[06:40:59] <Obormot\Gaia> I have $1000 and I owe someone $100. Then a week passes and there has been 10% inflation.
[06:41:13] <Obormot\Gaia> Now... I still have $1000 and still owe that guy $100.
[06:41:18] <Obormot\Gaia> What have I gained exactly?
[06:41:46] <Obormot\Gaia> He has lost - that's clear enough. But the benefit to me is what?

[06:43:40] <gwern> so now the sucker contractor has worked hard at the old rates for what you did 10% less work to obtain to pay him
[06:45:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why would I earn $1000 instead of earning $900 just like I did last week
[06:45:22] <gwern> because you adjusted your rates at the time of sale of your labor, instead of fixing it to old rates

[06:47:25] <gwern> and whatever it is, you can assume these people setting up the contractor and carefully leaving at the right time are perfectly capable of exploiting it

[14:03:07] <Gurkenglas> nice! i wonder what made that difficult.
[14:18:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Their JS editor framework, afaik
[14:19:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> They've had Markdown editor support for this for some time
[14:20:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, and adding the hover-popups for the footnotes isn't entirely trivial either, but I suspect the other thing was the more challenging part

[14:25:31] <Gurkenglas> I would like to see that patch. iirc they tried opensourcing but people didnt contribute, and I could imagine copilot to help with that problem a lot
[14:26:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Their code's still on github afaik
[14:26:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... ugh, do I have to do the whole "try different nitters" thing :(
[14:27:32] <Gurkenglas> they don't automatically forward you to each other in case of problems so the whole thing doesnt come down at once?

[14:31:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[14:31:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> And, no, nitters aren't connected with each other
[14:33:06] <Gurkenglas> i also notice having to switch between nitters a bunch, is that enemy action? are they not connected for obscurity? ...that shouldnt work against the twitter devs, maybe the obscurity is to provoke twitter less by being slightly inconvenient
[14:48:58] *** Joins: tarquinius (uid533142@user/tarquinius)
[14:52:42] <PapuaHardyNet> what?
[14:53:08] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, you believe that multiple nitter instances are being blocked simultaneously
[14:53:16] <PapuaHardyNet> why don't you host your own nitter
[14:53:22] <PapuaHardyNet> you have the skills and the desire to do so
[14:56:54] <Gurkenglas> not the desire, and i doubt about the skill too. wouldnt i need to tell people about that server, and keep a computer running? and i would need to figure out how to get into my router settings - since a few years ago when i try to log in it always triples the password length then says wrong password, router reset didnt help
[14:57:20] <PapuaHardyNet> what?
[14:57:39] <PapuaHardyNet> nitter is like gogs or searx, you are hosting a self-hosted front end for twitter
[14:57:52] <PapuaHardyNet> You don't even need to give other people access
[14:57:56] <PapuaHardyNet> you can be the sole user of it
[14:58:18] <PapuaHardyNet> which means you can run an instance on your computer and access it through localhost
[14:58:41] <Gurkenglas> makes sense. i used nitter when twitter required me to log in in order to read, which it currently doesnt afaic
[14:58:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: If you can't get into your own router to configure it, this seems like a problem you should solve ASAP, regardless of anything else whatsoever
[14:59:04] <Gurkenglas> because it indicates that something might have taken it over?
[14:59:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because of a broad range of things
[14:59:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's just a really bad idea to leave it like that
[14:59:34] <PapuaHardyNet> imagine someone hosting a tor end node from your router
[15:00:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> You can imagine all sorts of things but the point is that this is a very obvious and straightforward application of "security mindset"
[15:00:04] <PapuaHardyNet> (not *in* your router, but through your router)
[15:00:18] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm simply helping Gurkenglas by providing an easy to imagine example
[15:00:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I can't access my own internet gateway to configure it" should be huge red flags and ringing alarm bells instantly - fix that shit ASAP
[15:00:41] <Gurkenglas> the tech that was here about it maybe 2 years ago didnt notice anything that'd explain it when we got in that one time, i dont even remember how, i think it involved hardware manipulation?
[15:00:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> You may want to just replace the thing!
[15:01:21] <PapuaHardyNet> I recommend one of those openwrt routers
[15:01:30] *** Quits: ojarvini (~ojarvini@evo.paivola.fi) (Quit: WeeChat 2.1)
[15:01:38] <PapuaHardyNet> or something that supports openbsd if you have a month of free time to configure
[15:01:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> God no
[15:01:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Don't do that
[15:02:05] <Gurkenglas> iirc replacing it'd be a bad idea for ISP-contract-grandfathering reasons
[15:02:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uh, how's that
[15:02:14] *** Joins: ojarvini (ojarvini@evo.paivola.fi)
[15:03:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> (to be clear, "God no, don't do that" was about the OpenBSD thing specifically; getting a model with openwrt support is actually a good idea, even if you don't actually bother to install an open source firmware immediately or even ever)
[15:03:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> (e.g. my routers have the stock firmware and it's fine, but it's good to have the option)
[15:04:01] <Gurkenglas> like, this apartment has a contract that's better than a new one would be, and switching out the router might end it or something? are routers technically swappable without the ISP's knowledge/cooperation?
[15:04:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: They are indeed
[15:04:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Exceptions are possible, given sufficiently intrusive/paranoid ISPs, but rare)
[15:05:09] <Gurkenglas> perhaps just the 192.168.2.1 frontend is bugged - is there third-party software for doing router settings?
[15:05:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: (In addition to *swapping* per se, another potentially applicable option may be "place the provided modem/router combo in bridge mode and attach your own router" - this often applies to cable ISP connections)
[15:06:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> There is no third-party software that I'm aware of
[15:06:16] <Gurkenglas> i imagine trying to find it will get me lots of adware for people that google "what is forward ports halp"
[15:06:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> The web frontend is usually the only access
[15:06:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> What kind of connection do you have? DSL? Cable? Other?
[15:07:12] <Gurkenglas> i think it's called DSL? it's about 50 MBit/s.
[15:07:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> You are perplexingly incurious about how your lifeline to the internet works :\
[15:07:57] <Gurkenglas> I am curious about why you find that perplexing, though :D
[15:09:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is it not obvious? This is 2021 (and, especially, you do information/knowledge work)... if you have no internet connection, you are fucked
[15:11:22] <Gurkenglas> if i have no internet connection i use my mobile data. if that goes out i walk 5 minutes to public wifi. if my phone goes kaput i go to the library
[15:11:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> My suggestion to you is that you find out a lot more about how your internet service works... this is the kind of thing that has the potential to turn into a gigantic headache and huge amounts of stress with no warning at all
[15:11:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well ok
[15:12:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> ANYhow, back to the previous topic: you can run servers on other people's computers, you know
[15:12:42] <Gurkenglas> (my internet connection does go out every few months for some hours to days. germany ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
[15:13:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> e.g. if I were inclined to run a public nitter instance, I certainly wouldn't do it from one of my home boxes
[15:15:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm
[15:16:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> What if instead of using nitter, I look at the nitter source code and use Twitter's unofficial API directly
[15:16:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Will they block me?
[15:17:35] <Gurkenglas> how is that different from running a local nitter node
[15:20:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uh, well, in the one case I have to set up some sort of server, configure it, run it, while in the other case... I write like a half-dozen lines of code in my existing program?
[15:26:53] <Gurkenglas> ooh im getting further in inspecting the login frontend than last time i tried, a year or a few ago. submitValue() thinks the password is input#pwd.input-error. Now what was the password... i remember changing it when we got in once, then beating myself up over not making it "aaa" in case i can type in "a" and get it tripled to the correct password
[15:29:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Bah, 10 out of the 17 nitters on this nitter instances list I found are now down
[15:29:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sorry, 11 out of 17

[15:31:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Switched to a working nitter for now while I investigate a more general solution
[15:32:49] <Gurkenglas> hmmm the tripling is because xencode maps 'dsa' to '%91%cd%85'
[15:34:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> wtf is xencode
[15:35:40] <synthmeat> "Wikipedia can suck my dick." ~ Corey Feldman
[15:38:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> What is that apropos of

[15:40:05] <synthmeat> *errors about him
[15:41:20] <Gurkenglas> xencode is defined by them, apparently. somehow i imagined they'd use libraries :D
[15:44:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://twiiit.com/ ... hmmm
[15:44:26] <Gurkenglas> replacing '%91%cd%85' with something nontripled manually in the debugger... sends me to the login page again, but without a "wrong password" error. hmm. so it's not that the router is using some older software that doesn't expect a string that looks like '%91%cd%85' or it wouldn't behave differently than for 'asd'
[15:44:26] <Robomot> Twiiit redirecting proxy for Nitter. (A redirecting proxy for the Nitter, an alternative Twitter frontend.)
[15:45:57] <Gurkenglas> my breakpoint is skipped about half the time? ......
[15:49:08] <Gurkenglas> and now it's every time. skipped if i set it in that xencode function too, though the password still triples...
[15:51:27] <Gurkenglas> that problem went away for now when i closed the login page and debugger tool and opened all again :I
[15:55:05] <Gurkenglas> hmmmmmmmm trying to login no longer shows me a wrong-password error at all :( i dont think i changed anything
[15:56:15] <Gurkenglas> maybe i broke something in the router by sending an unencoded password?

[20:45:04] <pompolic> to be fair that's me_IRL probably
[20:45:16] <pompolic> yeah it's crazy
[20:45:28] <pompolic> in the mid 00s, shaders were invented
[20:45:35] <pompolic> before that you had fixed function pipelines
[20:45:50] <pompolic> unsure about the PS2 but the PS1 definitely had a fixed function graphics chip
[20:46:03] <two2thehead> https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ElderlyEnchantedAlpinegoat-mobile.mp4
[20:46:03] <Robomot> video/mp4 (4 MB)
[20:46:24] <pompolic> and turns out often this is hard to emulate exactly (i think partly because, "general" as they may be, the shader pipeline is also kind of opinionated)
[20:46:41] <two2thehead> TIL "Fixed-function is a term canonically used to contrast 3D graphics APIs and earlier GPUs designed prior to the advent of shader-based 3D graphics APIs and GPU architectures."
[20:46:56] <two2thehead> so a generational/category differentiator
[20:47:00] <pompolic> it's a bit like opengl immediate mode

[20:48:45] <pompolic> the claim i was about to make -- "shaders are like this because of architectural considerations that aren't even in GPUs anymore" is from his blog
[20:49:08] <gwern> pompolic: I wouldn't say so. no one would seriously argue that GPU shaders are not turing-complete. I mean, you can very obviously implement a cellular automation or a rewrite system or wang tiles or something
[20:49:50] <pompolic> yep, but with this "ubershader" you have another "platform" implemented in shaders
[20:50:05] <pompolic> so it's not "are shaders turing complete" but "are ubershaders turing complete"
