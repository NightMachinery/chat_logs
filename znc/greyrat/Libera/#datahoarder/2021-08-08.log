[22:41:03] <rawktucc> question for linux people in here
[22:41:10] <rawktucc> 8TB Barracuda Computer in a seagate enclosure
[22:41:22] <rawktucc> writing to this drive is painfully slow, almost as if there's something wrong with it
[22:41:26] <rawktucc> yet smart stats are all cleared
[22:41:33] <rawktucc> it took 15 minutes to write ext4 superblock info
[22:41:42] <rawktucc> to the bare drive over a SATA 6gbit connection.
[22:41:43] <unfinity> ・゜゜・。 ​ 。・゜゜\_O<​ qua​ck!
[22:41:44] <rawktucc> anyone have any ideas?
[22:41:45] <rawktucc> ,bef
[22:41:45] <unfinity> rawktucc you befriended a duck in 2.505 seconds! You have made friends with 1 duck in #datahoarder.
[22:41:49] <joepie91> ,bef
[22:41:49] <unfinity> You tried befriending a non-existent duck. That's freaking creepy.
[22:41:52] <joepie91> bleh :p
[22:42:14] <rawktucc> i want to bin this as a bad drive but the smart stats aren't freaking out... plus once it was formatted ext4 it could write urandom info without issue
[22:42:16] <joepie91> rawktucc: first suspicion is a fucked controller or a loose connection
[22:42:26] <joepie91> always try the diver internally first
[22:42:31] <rawktucc> yup did that
[22:42:35] <joepie91> s/diver/drive/
[22:42:37] <rawktucc> extremely slow to format as ext4
[22:42:45] <joepie91> even internally?
[22:42:48] <rawktucc> yes
[22:42:51] <rawktucc> 15 ish minutes
[22:42:55] <rawktucc> normally takes 30 seconds
[22:43:02] <joepie91> then I would expect the drive controller itself to be fucked
[22:43:11] <rawktucc> blarg
[22:43:13] <rawktucc> what do I do now
[22:43:26] <rawktucc> well out of warranty and it's been shucked to remove it lol
[22:43:31] <rawktucc> sell as a "as is"?
[22:43:31] <joepie91> controller replacements are not unheard of but quite possibly not worth it economically
[22:43:35] <joepie91> shucking is irrelevant
[22:43:43] <joepie91> out of warranty does matter though :p
[22:44:04] <joepie91> rawktucc: as a last hail mary you could try reflashing the controller FW
[22:44:17] <rawktucc> would i need a fancy flashing card for that
[22:44:18] <x10> ^^^very last hail mary
[22:44:19] <joepie91> and inspecting for any bad joints of eg. the SATA connector
[22:44:35] <joepie91> solder joints that is
[22:44:47] <rawktucc> the USB to SATA adapter has some PCB scratches from me trying to pry it open but the issue still persists on the main board outside of the enclosure so I think that's irrelevant
[22:44:48] <joepie91> you can usually flash over SATA afaik
[22:44:56] <rawktucc> ntfs format is instant
[22:44:56] <rawktucc> wtf
[22:45:10] <joepie91> 🤷
[22:45:26] <joepie91> good moment for a disk benchmark I'd say
[22:45:26] <rawktucc> god why do distros not come with exfat fuse as a default
[22:45:28] <joepie91> crystaldiskmark or w/e
[22:45:37] <joepie91> because patents
[22:45:42] <rawktucc> but debian has it
[22:45:44] <rawktucc> oh
[22:45:50] <rawktucc> buster/main
[22:45:59] <joepie91> different distros have different risk tolerances for patents :p
[22:46:17] <joepie91> historically this was a big deal with x264 also
[22:46:24] <joepie91> and a couple other things
[22:46:48] <rawktucc> i can hear the disk churning
[22:46:58] <joepie91> as in, strange physical noise?
[22:47:08] <rawktucc> normal noises
[22:47:12] <rawktucc> but nothing should bwriting to it
[22:47:12] <joepie91> ah ok :p
[22:47:29] <joepie91> is it intermittent writing noises or continuous noise?
[22:47:34] <rawktucc> it was continuous
[22:47:35] <rawktucc> exfat and ntfs are super fast to reformat
[22:47:39] <rawktucc> ext4 writing superblocks is taking it's time
[22:47:41] <joepie91> continuous is suspect
[22:47:44] <rawktucc> i added time before the command
[22:47:46] <rawktucc> i hear it now
[22:47:57] <rawktucc> thunk thunk thunk thunk every half second. not a click, a thunk like it's writing
[22:48:02] <rawktucc> i think I shouldn't bother using this drive for data
[22:48:05] <joepie91> often a sign of mechanical failure
[22:48:06] <joepie91> yeah
[22:48:08] <joepie91> I'd bin this as dead
[22:48:10] <x10> iirc theres some sort of lazy init for ext3/4 too
[22:48:19] <rawktucc> x10 yeah lazy init is by default
[22:48:27] <rawktucc> unless you do this
[22:48:27] <x10> ah didn't know that
[22:48:28] <rawktucc> sudo mkfs.ext4 -E lazy_itable_init=0,lazy_journal_init=0 -m 0
[22:48:44] <rawktucc> i always format with that anyway but if I do an unlazy init it takes forever writing inode tables for this drive
[22:48:50] <rawktucc> for working drives it's all good though, couple extra minutes
[22:48:54] <rawktucc> saves you time later
[22:49:18] <joepie91> combination of bad perf + continuous noise means there's probably something fucked or misaligned mechanically and it has to retry every operation a million times
[22:49:35] <joepie91> which is a problem you ain't gonna fix without a cleanroom and possibly not even with
[22:49:59] <rawktucc> im gonna hail mary reflash
[22:50:03] <rawktucc> im glad seagate has instructions for linux use
[22:50:07] <rawktucc> and not fucking DOS
[22:50:12] <joepie91> lmao
[22:51:38] <rawktucc> pcb and traces are all intact on the unit itself
[22:52:14] <joepie91> cold connector joint is the most likely cause of failure electrically
[22:52:20] <joepie91> since that's a stress point
[22:52:29] <rawktucc>  No Newer Firmware Available
[22:53:26] <rawktucc> no old firmware either
[22:53:28] <rawktucc> shucks!
[22:55:18] <rawktucc> anyone here using storage.lima-labs.com by chance?

[23:34:47] <rawktucc> Seems likely mech failure
[23:35:00] <rawktucc> i put a note and some tape over the ports so I can use it in an emergency but I doubt I will
[23:35:10] <rawktucc> i've pulled some other drives and am moving data around them right now lol
[23:35:19] <moo> you can try shucking it and see if it works better?
[23:35:34] <rawktucc> did that, same results
