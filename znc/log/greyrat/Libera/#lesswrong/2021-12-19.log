[00:32:15] <Obormot\Arcturus>  including the event organizers, thought to provide said things)
[00:33:08] <gwern> it sounds like a cute welcoming thing until you realize that if they didn't say it, there might not be any balls or discs

[00:33:25] <spxtr> Obormot\Arcturus: I read that as more indicating that they don't know how many people will show up, so they'll have some balls and discs but possibly not enough.
[00:33:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: It's worse than that, because there still might not be any balls or disks even after they said it

[00:41:59] <bmk> see but bringing a ball or a disk costs each person epsilon amount, whereas as long as some proportion of people bring disks and balls, there will be no marginal benefit to an additional disk or ball, so everyone reasons that everyone else will bring a disk/ball, thus they shouldnt bring one
[00:43:35] <bmk> all of the rats that like decision theory and conclude that they should bring a disk/ball anyways end up spending the rest of the afternoon working out the decision theoretical implications of this setup and forget to ever go to the event

[00:58:54] <bmk> when i visited the bay a few months ago i talked to some people who were pretty ratty and they seemed like nice people
[00:59:08] <bmk> though this might be because of the subcommunity i interacted with

[00:59:58] <bmk> is the set of alignment \ MIRI people a very different distribution of people from the stereotypical bay rat distribution?
[00:59:59] <quanticle> gwern: What I don't understand is how there's a shortage of distilled water. Last two times I've gone, both Target and Walmart have been out.
[01:00:23] <gwern> quanticle: my guess is just trucking shortages and distilled water being a bulky heavy useless low-price thing
[01:00:37] <quanticle> Yeah, fair enough
[01:00:57] <gwern> "we can either ship the flatscreen TVs and iPhones, or 1000 gallons of water pretty much like what you get out of the tap" "I think we should go with the former"

[01:00:59] <spxtr> seems like it could be efficient to distill it on site rather than ship it?

[01:06:11] <quanticle> Meditation is fine as long as you don't go overboard with it.
[01:06:29] <gwern> the good thing about the ai alignment circles is that they seem to be less prone to the woo and select for people still functional. and to the extent that they aren't, well, there's so much money showering down on AI that you can make up for deficits there
[01:06:30] <bmk> saturn2: wha'ts circling? never heard of it. also, not moving in with anyone sounds like a big ask considering the rents
[01:06:44] <quanticle> Or maybe meditation is one of those things that's fine for non-rationalists to do, but is not fine for rationalists.

[02:16:23] <shawwwn> Welcome to the LessWrong Christmas protest. For background info: https://i.imgur.com/APn1oxm.png
[02:17:21] <shawwwn> one of the purposes of it being a protest is to draw awareness. And most citizens tend to agree that protests can be a valuable tool, even if they're largely ineffective. That's why this one will be here, and not #lw-meta, unless you intend to disband the protest by force.
[02:17:44] <shawwwn> The central issue is community.

[02:18:28] <shawwwn> We've all had the opportunity to get to know each other for many years now. Personally, I was delighted to associate with Obormot, and to learn his many baking recipes
[02:18:41] <spxtr> any good resources for learning about this web3.0 nonsense? one of my ex-seattle rat friends was trying to get me excited about that stuff
[02:18:59] <shawwwn> I've also learned a thing or two from gwern, quanticle, kuudes, dbohdan (RIP), and so many others.
[02:19:30] <Betawolf> I was trying to figure out what web3 actually refers to earlier but I couldn't bring myself to actually read anything about it.
[02:19:31] <shawwwn> you're all near and dear to my heart. And I hope those feelings are at least partially reciprocated.
[02:19:48] <kuudes> dbohdan is still alive
[02:20:17] <shawwwn> he is. But he's not present. And he hasn't been for months -- just like Logos01. For us, in this #lesswrong experience, he is effectively dead
[02:20:38] <gwern> 'What is surprising, however, is that GPT-3 generations are competitive with the e-SNLI corpus, even though that corpus is generally regarded as high quality. While GPT3 doesn’t always win, the gold-standard free-text explanations from the corpus serve as a reasonable upper bound for what a supervised explanation generation model trained on them could be expected to produce. Some examples...
[02:20:44] <gwern> ...of GPT-3-preferred explanations, along with human preference annotations, are given in Table 1.' https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08674 hehe

[02:20:46] <shawwwn> dbohdan left because he didn't have a choice. He had to focus in his health.
[02:20:59] <shawwwn> Logos01, though, was removed by force.
[02:22:10] <shawwwn> Suppose you were in a bar, hanging out with your friend group. Suddenly the security guard walks over and bounces your friend out for no apparent reason, and bars them from entry. As far as you can tell, the behavior of your friend was substantially identical to your own behavior
[02:22:39] <spxtr> heh, remember when madplatypus, obormot, and (iirc?) kuudes were banned? place was dead af until they were unbanned
[02:22:43] <shawwwn> When you ask the guard "Why?" they refuse to answer, or to even acknowledge that this happened at all.
[02:23:10] <shawwwn> see, little tidbits of history like that are fascinating to me. I had no idea obormot was once banned.f
[02:23:20] <shawwwn> As you can see, he's become a fine, upstanding, reformed member of the community
[02:23:22] <saturn2> i've repeatedly acknowledged it and explained why
[02:24:16] <shawwwn> I anticipated a tactic like this. This is the "rewriting history" card.
[02:24:58] <saturn2> yes... you are rewriting history
[02:25:11] <shawwwn> Then let's rewrite some history together.
[02:25:23] <saturn2> nah
[02:25:39] <shawwwn> For the benefit of people out of the loop, would you care to say why Logos was banned?
[02:25:48] <shawwwn> I don't think we've ever heard it phrased in your own words.

[02:27:00] <shawwwn> Yes and no. Emily and I are still apparently together, though it almost ended last week. Which is an excellent intro for why I'm doing this for Logos.
[02:27:37] <shawwwn> When I say that Logos is my friend, I didn't simply make that up. He and I had several long discussions about his personal life, his goals, what it's like to live with autism, and his relationship problems
[02:27:59] <shawwwn> These were in DMs (as many of the interesting conversations are).
[02:28:47] <shawwwn> But as someone with a disability -- narcolepsy, which has contributed to me getting fired four times now -- I empathize strongly with his struggle.
[02:29:26] <shawwwn> Now, just because someone has a disability, it doesn't mean you *have* to accommodate them. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. 
[02:29:42] <shawwwn> It would be absurd to remove all staircases just because some people can't use staircases.
[02:30:05] <shawwwn> Nonetheless, accommodations are typically seen as a good thing.
[02:30:47] <shawwwn> I submit that the accommodation of occasionally talking about air conditioners was in no way harmful to the community
[02:32:05] <shawwwn> I own an air conditioner, and personally I've found it to be a wonderful investment. Discussing how it works -- and being wrong about how they work -- is a necessary step for most technically-inclined adult weebs. I bet lots of you have talked about air conditioners.
[02:32:55] <shawwwn> Now, you'll notice that when given the opportunity to explain, roughly, "Why did you ban someone for talking about air conditioners?", then no explanation is forthcoming.
[02:33:42] <shawwwn> Because, for example, talking about air conditioners seems no more harmful than Obormot talking about baking, or quanticle posting his wonderful kitten photos.
[02:33:53] <dv2> come to think of it, it is a fascinating subject, and I wish I knew more about it
[02:34:01] <shawwwn> I agree!
[02:34:19] <shawwwn> That's why it's felt so troubling to realize that we're not allowed to discuss air conditioners here.
[02:34:39] <dv2> Does it just turn your room into refrigerator, or does it work by some other method?

[02:34:58] <spxtr> that's how it works
[02:35:12] <dv2> I'm sure there are many nuances, spxtr
[02:35:25] <spxtr> same refrigeration cycle
[02:36:14] <dv2> but a much bigger volume, and fans
[02:36:16] <shawwwn> Now, that being said -- and after having given saturn2 an opportunity to explain his side of the story, which he declined -- I've prepared a straw poll for the community. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Kbk0tQ-ULUl4kbHRXTKe69ImhYuBPNr4eyQK9f807Mg/edit It simply asks whether you agree or disagree with the decision to ban Logos01.
[02:36:32] <shawwwn> Obviously, the poll doesn't mean much. People can vote as many times as they want.
[02:37:16] <shawwwn> But it's also at least a temperature check for community feeling on this, since many of us find it much easier to express an opinion via clicking on a button than talking to people. (I'd personally prefer to be clicking on buttons now, but alas.)
[02:37:25] <dv2> I have voted, but will our leaders take note?
[02:37:39] <shawwwn> A good question.
[02:38:14] <saturn2> reasons logos01 is banned: showing no apparent interest in lesswrong-related topics, repeatedly insisting on incorrect theories he came up with (not just air conditioners, but also units of measurement... magnets... whatever happens to pop into his head)
[02:39:48] <dv2> I don't know his theory of air conditioning or magnets, but I'm sure he was interested in lw-related topics
[02:39:58] <dv2> and showed it
[02:40:06] <shawwwn> yep.
[02:40:09] <Gurkenglas> oh right, that protest thing. my vote for unban
[02:40:31] <dv2> it strikes me as a very uncharitable characterization
[02:40:36] <saturn2> says the person who does nothing but copy and paste random articles from ##news
[02:40:44] <shawwwn> and, again, remember that his tendencies in this regard are due to a medical condition.
[02:41:10] <shawwwn> that's not a hall pass for him to say whatever he wants.
[02:41:30] <shawwwn> but I don't think that occasionally being wrong about air conditioners was too harmful. And many others seem to agree.
[02:41:36] <shawwwn> That's, in fact, what the /ignore feature is for.
[02:42:00] <dv2> Exactly
[02:42:28] <dv2> or maybe if you find yourself consistently annoyed at the state of the channel where everyone else is fine, maybe a /quit is in order
[02:42:47] *** Joins: [itchyjunk] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470)
[02:44:02] <shawwwn> that too. And the reason I haven't escalated things to this point for many months is because saturn2 is, by all accounts, an excellent community steward, and has done well for us for years. It would be a shame if he quit just because the community felt that one of his decisions was out of line.
[02:44:58] <dv2> A shame indeed - why can't we all just get along. Why do some unelected members get to impose their arbitrary will on the rest of us?
[02:45:08] <shawwwn> There is an alternate way forward: the problem is that the mod team is too small. When I tried to discuss this in various back alleys around #lesswrong, the repeated answer was "talk to saturn2" from the only other active moderator. When I told them "I've tried, for months," they said "then give up."
[02:45:59] <shawwwn> The benefits of an additional moderator would include: saturn2 would be able to /ignore Logos01. Right now he can't really do that, since he's essentially the only security guard on payroll. He has to know when someone is getting rowdy.
[02:46:22] <shawwwn> with an additional security guard, then perhaps saturn2 could make an exception in this one case.
[02:46:29] <dv2> That sounds like a great idea
[02:46:49] <dv2> Truly a compromise worthy of the ancients
[02:46:50] <saturn2> gwern is the founder of the channel, he decides who the mods are
[02:47:25] <shawwwn> yup. I discussed it privately with feep, and he's interested in the role. I think he's shown to have excellent judgement, and all of us trust him more or less implicitly. He's maintained feepbot for many years

[02:51:07] <shawwwn> The poll is currently in a dead heat, 50/50 split: https://i.imgur.com/7RlI3uh.png (I've voted once, and shan't be voting again.) So, as Gurkenglas asks, I'd like to submit a couple more pieces of evidence in regards to the rewriting-history claim.
[02:51:54] <ggreer> Why? I’d probably never moderate
[02:52:04] <saturn2> /ignore is not a solution, if people interested in discussing lw-related topics join and see a channel filled with nonsense about factorio and anti-mormonism and incorrect theories about how machines work, they will leave

[02:52:14] <dv2> That's perfect
[02:52:41] <Guest32123> shawwwn, you're kind of immature yourself, why are you so judgemental of others?
[02:53:00] <shawwwn> Oh, I'm terribly flawed. I'm no angel.
[02:53:11] <shawwwn> But that's the point of #lesswrong -- we all care about improving ourselves. That's why we're here
[02:53:43] <shawwwn> After my ban, I took a hard look at my behavior and decided that it was time to change. Ever since then, I've tried to be a model citizen.
[02:54:09] <shawwwn> Apparently Obormot, kuudes, and a few others have also been banned, and then eventually unbanned. So we've seen firsthand that it's possible to reform.
[02:54:35] <Guest32123> Huh. Out of curiosity, over what was kuudes banned?
[02:54:36] <shawwwn> Frankly, my issue is that I feel very bad that Logos01 won't be allowed to participate in the Christmas festivities.
[02:55:02] <dv2> I was once klined from freenode by mst for asking where to get free Windows 10
[02:55:04] <shawwwn> he's been a member for something like 5x longer than I've been. And I've been here for years now.
[02:56:18] <shawwwn> imagine spending Christmas with the same friend group, ten times in a row, and then suddenly one of those friends decides to shun you on behalf of all your other friends -- even though, as the poll shows, at least half of them don't mind.
[02:56:42] <spxtr> Guest32123: This was something like 7 or 8 years ago? idr exactly. I don't remember why he was banned, but I do remember that obormot and madplatypus were banned for dominating the conversations in here.
[02:56:43] <quanticle> When was Obormot banned?
[02:56:47] <quanticle> Oh
[02:56:49] <quanticle> That banning
[02:57:01] <shawwwn> I know how much it sucks. During 2019 I was banned from HN, and the holidays felt miserable. Everyone was wishing each other a marry christmas, and all I could do was look on from afar.
[02:57:02] <spxtr> one of the mods just didn't like them, is the actual reason
[02:57:04] <saturn2> there are no christmas festivites in #lesswrong, we treat it the same as any other day
[02:57:35] <shawwwn> I don't. Christmas 2019 was special to me. It was when gwern and I made our breakthroughs in GPT
[02:58:04] <shawwwn> It was special to the Cloud TPU support staff too. They gave us our TPU resources mostly as a christmas gift, in response to me wishing them a merry christmas.
[02:58:12] <shawwwn> (I can dig up the emails if necessary.)
[02:58:53] <saturn2> i don't see what that has to do with logos01
[02:58:56] <shawwwn> The fact is, you don't speak for the community saturn2. Your role as moderator is to serve the community's interests. As far as I can tell, 99% of the time, you've done a stellar job at that.
[02:59:21] <Gurkenglas> shawwwn, that does look like he didn't acknowledge/explain. Maybe the mutual rewriting-history accusation is due to the misunderstanding that he acknowledged it only in #lesswrong?
[02:59:21] <shawwwn> Unfortunately, that 1% happened to include banning logos for "no apparent reason whatsoever."
[02:59:54] <dv2> We all make mistake sometimes. The important part is that we learn from them
[03:00:06] <dv2> mistakes*
[03:00:06] <shawwwn> ^
[03:00:10] <Gurkenglas> who are you quoting :D
[03:00:29] <shawwwn> the community. :)
[03:01:00] <saturn2> Gurkenglas: i spent hours discussing it with him in PM, he only screenshotted the part after i had gotten sick of going around in circles and stopped responding
[03:01:19] <shawwwn> Ah. In that case, would you mind if I share the rest of the backlog?
[03:01:26] <shawwwn> That way people can see and decide for themselves.
[03:02:46] <shawwwn> I don't like posting logs publicly without permission. The "no logs" rule serves an excellent function. We all feel a lot safer expressing an occasional opinion, and DMs are no different
[03:03:27] <shawwwn> so without explicit permission from saturn2, I'd rather not share screenshots of his DMs with me. (that screenshot only shows my words to him, and my words are my own decision.)
[03:04:17] <Gurkenglas> Damn, it's currently looking watertight that one of you two is actually being revisionist.

[03:04:34] <shawwwn> But, speaking as a scientist and as someone who strives to be somewhat logical some of the time: he did not discuss it with me for hours. In fact, the only thing resembling an explanation was "I need less speculation from Logos01"

[03:05:52] <saturn2> actually i misremembered, the hours-long discussion was about shawwwn's own ban, where he pretended not to understand why it was bad to be obnoxious. then there were two shorter exchanges about logos
[03:06:26] <shawwwn> mm. We all occasionally misremember things.
[03:06:39] <saturn2> go ahead and post it if you want

[03:12:28] <saturn2> you gave me no reason to think unbanning logos01 would make #lesswrong a better place, and i still see no such reason
[03:13:30] <Gurkenglas> i dont think mods are supposed to be consequentalist
[03:13:37] <shawwwn> indeed. Remember, it's reverse chronological. That screenshot isn't persuasive, because it was *after* me doing that. I've saved the best for last.
[03:13:42] <shawwwn> exhibit D: https://i.imgur.com/M6E1Evi.png
[03:14:29] <kiboneu> man shawwwn reminds me why i don't want to be op
[03:15:01] <shawwwn> yes. it sucks.
[03:15:10] <shawwwn> and that's why I respect how much bs saturn2 has had to wade through over the years
[03:15:22] <shawwwn> but it comes with the job.
[03:15:50] <spxtr> something that has frustrated me to no end in recent years is that there are shockingly few resources for learning Benagli/Bangla as an English speaker. It's surprising because it's the 7th most spoken language in the world.
[03:16:11] <shawwwn> Mods are necessary in order to foster the community. Not the other way around.
[03:16:21] <Betawolf> There can't be that few speakers of both languages, surely?
[03:16:35] <two2thehead> Betawolf, it's relatively rare online
[03:16:53] <spxtr> Betawolf: it's one language, Bangla is what they call it and Bengali is what the brits called it.
[03:17:04] <Betawolf> Hmm, any idea why? I don't know what Bengali script looks like offhand.
[03:17:17] <Betawolf> spxtr: yeah I meant Bengali/English speakers.
[03:17:18] <dv2> This doesn't seem to be a lw-related topic. Should we ban spxtr, Betawolf and two2thehead?
[03:17:27] <two2thehead> to give an example, I've seen Bahasa Malay and Bahasa Indonesian offered online more than Bangla
[03:17:32] <spxtr> It has >250 million speakers. My guess for why is that Bangladesh/West Bengal are not super hot economically.
[03:17:42] <Gurkenglas> "But if you don't give him another chance (...) I won't be returning either" <- :o
[03:17:56] <spxtr> Not many people learn the language unless they're in my situation: significant other is a native speaker
[03:18:15] <shawwwn> Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I propose the following compromise. 1. feep is promoted to moderator on a permanent basis. 2. logos is unbanned, with specific guidelines from saturn2 that he needs to follow. 3. if the mod team -- emphasis on more than one person -- decides that logos needs to be banned, I will submit my #lesswrong resignation. (i.e. I vouch for logos, in the mafia sense.)
[03:19:01] <quanticle> spxtr: There are a lot of languages that are like that. Bahasa Indonesia is also pretty resource poort
[03:19:04] <Betawolf> I suppose it's not a common language for a lot of people. Languages like French, Russian, Spanish are useful because you can use them in several different countries.

[03:19:52] <dv2> shawwwn, that sounds like a great idea.
[03:20:00] <spxtr> quanticle: I would say that Bangla is probably the most spoken language with that property? I certainly believe there are more.
[03:20:21] <quanticle> Probably.
[03:20:34] <dv2> shawwwn, though since moderation seems to be such a burden, maybe this duty could be cycled between different channel members
[03:20:34] <quanticle> I forgot how many people Bangladesh has
[03:20:39] <shawwwn> the community seems to be agreeing: https://i.imgur.com/SbpB6Xg.png -- (As a reminder, if you haven't voted yet, the poll is at https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Kbk0tQ-ULUl4kbHRXTKe69ImhYuBPNr4eyQK9f807Mg/edit#responses )
[03:20:53] <spxtr> 165 million
[03:20:53] <quanticle> Since when is #lesswrong a democracy?
[03:20:59] <shawwwn> it's not.
[03:21:06] <quanticle> Yeah, definitely more than Indonesia
[03:21:08] <kiboneu> ot
[03:21:12] <dv2> shawwwn, this would not only unburden saturn2 (and whatever other permanent moderatosr), but would also give moderation experience to others, which would be useful in case saturn2 leaves
[03:21:14] <kiboneu> it's more like a pub
[03:21:55] <saturn2> i actually agree that there should be more mods, and i would likely have added a couple myself if i had not lost that ability in the move to libera
[03:22:29] <Betawolf> I would be happy with feep as a mod.
[03:22:31] <nshepperd> i disagree with adding more mods just so shawwwn can manipulate them into overriding each other
[03:23:03] <two2thehead> I don't know the exact conversation that led to logos01 being banned, and every time I ask literally everyone demurs and doesn't want to give me a text output of said conversation. So statistically speaking, I probably will never know. Having said that, I like Logos01 and he's always been easily in the top 10% in terms of IQ and knowledge of the people here. And that is saying *quite* a lot.
[03:23:11] <shawwwn> it's a mod team, nshepperd. "team" implies that most members act on their own -- like a soccer team -- but that occasionally members work together in tricky situations.
[03:24:00] <shawwwn> nshepperd: would you like to give me permission to share screenshots of my "manipulation" chatlogs with you? That way, everyone can see for themselves.
[03:24:19] <nshepperd> no
[03:24:23] <shawwwn> okay.
[03:25:44] <shawwwn> suffice to say, yes, when I realized that this decision was a mistake, I tried to appeal to the only other active moderator (nshepperd) so that we could find a mutual solution to the current dilemma of "someone who's been here for 10 years is being excluded permanently"
[03:25:52] <dv2> It seems rude and suspicious to accuse someone of manipulation and then deny them the opportunity to present evidence to the contrary
[03:26:54] <Betawolf> He didn't accuse him of manipulation, he pointed out that it would be possible for shawwn to do that.
[03:27:10] <shawwwn> well, I'm half jewish, so it's a reasonable suspicion
[03:27:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> I am with nshepperd on this one
[03:27:39] <dv2> He implied that it would happen
[03:27:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Add more mods only if they will moderate in exactly the same way that the current mods do
[03:28:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> i.e. if we can have a saturn3, saturn4, etc., then yeah, I'm for more mods
[03:28:33] <two2thehead> I do agree with the statement that it is a mod *team*. feep would be an excellent mod
[03:28:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or nshepperd222 or w/e
[03:28:45] <saturn2> (i meant i was considering adding more before this whole kerfuffle started, but then realized i had lost that capability)
[03:28:46] <shawwwn> Closing statements: none of us enjoy this situation. But ultimately, anime-style justice is an important consideration. As evidenced by the poll, more than half of today's participants feel that the decision was unwarranted. https://i.imgur.com/SbpB6Xg.png There is currently no recourse.
[03:29:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Definitely the moderation policies of this channel shouldn't change, except maybe to ban obnoxious people more readily
[03:29:26] <dv2> I say: defund the #lesswrong operators
[03:29:44] <shawwwn> lesswrong isn't a democracy, but adding feep as a mod would resolve the current situation. everyone seems to feel that it would be a beneficial move for the community
[03:29:52] <shawwwn> which brings us to the topic of gwern.
[03:30:02] <kiboneu> i just want to go back to talking about snail breeding
[03:30:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> For example, this whole convo should be in #lw-meta, and my preferred mod policy would be to +q anyone who keeps talking about it after being warned
[03:30:08] <shawwwn> (as do I.)
[03:30:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway yeah, snails for sure
[03:30:21] <Gurkenglas> what if only 2 out of 3 have to agree to ban someone? then the power is checked and not impotent.
[03:30:35] <Betawolf> like, breeding snails for food?
[03:30:39] <nshepperd> mod power should not be checked
[03:30:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Betawolf: Eating snails is a plot point in one of the "Wizard of the Emerald City" books
[03:31:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, they might've been slugs
[03:31:15] <Betawolf> guess it depends if you like the crunch
[03:31:21] <two2thehead> so five out of 9 think logos01 should be allowed to come back. Hypothesis, conditional on you asking relatively long term (>2years, regular posters) chatters, you'll easily get 60% pro logos
[03:31:23] <kiboneu> Betawolf: w.r.t. an earlier conversation about breeding snails to solve salt mazes

[03:32:27] <shawwwn> I'll have you know: shame on you saturn2 and nshepperd for forcing me to involve gwern in this. I tried so hard, for almost three months. But your unwillingness to compromise leaves no alternative.
[03:32:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Note: If you use POSIX networking code, you should be aware that the POSIX networking API is not protocol-agnostic (you must handle some of the differences between IPv4 and IPv6 yourself). It is a connect-by-IP API rather than a connect-by-name API, which means that you must do a lot of extra work if you want to achieve the same initial-connection performance and robustness that higher-level APIs give you for free." ... hm,
[03:32:46] <Obormot\Arcturus>  this is a good point
[03:33:10] <shawwwn> gwern's op status is honorary. He's done more for this community than anyone else, through his words and his actions. he hasn't *needed* to moderate anything -- he's that good at fostering community.
[03:33:13] <dv2> shawwwn, you're an good friend. I hope these unpleasant people give you what you want
[03:33:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> What if someone wants to run an IRC server with an IPV6 IP...? IRCClient wouldn't support that in its current state... even though libircclient does... because it's a whole separate call

[03:34:38] <dv2> Obormot\Arcturus, I'm pretty sure there are ipv6 irc servers? and tor irc servers, etc
[03:35:22] <shawwwn> based on the evidence presented today, I call upon gwern, in His wisdom, to promote feep to moderator on a full time basis.

[04:01:04] <shawwwn> the thing is... one of my existential dreads in life is that by the time our kids are teenagers, I'll already be ancient and out of touch. So they'll dislike me either way. (Like father, like son; perhaps their children will dislike them too, as is family tradition.)
[04:01:38] <kuudes> ... is it possible to just get dna from potential embryos at disk, and then use third party to select and inform the fertilizer?
[04:01:48] <shawwwn> we would've already had a 10yo if we hadn't decided on a different life path 10 years ago. It was the right move at the time. But as I get older, it feels hollow
[04:01:59] <kuudes> :-(
[04:02:05] <shawwwn> someone needs to make a baby incubator where the kid pops out as a 10yo
[04:02:14] <Betawolf> of course you'll be out of touch, the horrifying thing would be being as hip as your kids
[04:02:15] <shawwwn> and you can decide which memories to implant, etc
[04:02:33] <shawwwn> that way their early upbringing can be in a simulated reality
[04:02:44] <shawwwn> and we can get experimental evidence as to which realities are best

[04:33:19] <feepbot> Some improvements · Issue #1 · zielmicha/emacspy · GitHub (Your project is awesome! I spent some time making a bunch of additions, which you can find here: master...shawwn:master Basically I improved the interop between python and emacs. EmacsValues now im...)
[04:33:25] <catern> the dynamic modules support is relatively recent, it's just a way to link against C libraries from Emacs
[04:33:37] <catern> and this is basically just linking against libpython
[04:33:39] <dv2> star #2 :)
[04:34:13] <catern> this is bad though, elisp is good, certainly better than Python
[04:34:36] <dv2> No, elisp syntax is unbearable
[04:35:22] <quanticle> At least elisp has block delimiters
[04:35:35] <quanticle> So your editor doesn't have to guess when to unindent
[04:36:02] <catern> as is well known, syntax is the most important attribute of programming languages
[04:36:21] <dv2> pressing tab once in a while really isn't that much of a bother
[04:36:53] <catern> when Algol was discovered it was a major advance in programming languages because people could finally stop using all those parentheses in lisp

[04:39:34] <quanticle> catern: One interpreted singlethreaded vm is just as good as another as far as I'm concerned
[04:39:35] <catern> same with lisp too, it's just more of the same
[04:39:58] <catern> exactly, that's why I write everything in bash
[04:40:02] <quanticle> Haha
[04:40:20] <quanticle> But that gets back to my original (half-joking) assertion: bash's syntax sucks!
[04:40:29] <quanticle> Otherwise I'd write everything in bash too!
[04:40:43] <catern> definitely, bad syntax is what's wrong with bash

[04:41:21] <Robomot> image/jpeg (750x377; 20 KB)
[04:41:23] <catern> why do these stupid programming language developers keep making new syntaxes instead of just using the obviously correct C syntax (invented by C)
[04:41:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: Objective C is better though
[04:41:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Syntax-wise
[04:42:13] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: (sorry if you weren't following the conversation you might not realize I'm being sarcastic)
[04:42:27] <quanticle> Yeah, but Objective-C is also not an interpreted single-threaded VM, and is therefore outside the narcissism of small differences
[04:42:41] <quanticle> catern is being sarcastic, and I'm pulling a feep
[04:42:52] <catern> there are quite a few differences between Python, Ruby, Perl and Javascriptt
[04:42:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: No but I agree with you if you substitute Objective C for C
[04:43:19] <catern> and the point of new programming languages is not to experiment with new syntax, that's blub programmer nonsense
[04:43:59] <feep> fully disagree :D
[04:44:00] <quanticle> catern: All those differences are, to a very large extent, just syntax. 
[04:44:03] <catern> and claiming to dislike lisp because of its syntax just indicates you have never programmed in lisp
[04:44:10] <quanticle> Syntax and libraries
[04:44:14] <feep> I dislike lisp because of its syntax
[04:44:27] <spxtr> I like lisp, in part because of its syntax
[04:44:37] <catern> well, exclusively because of its syntax
[04:44:43] <catern> having an opinion on the syntax is fine
[04:45:09] <quanticle> I think Lisp's syntax is all right. I don't really pay attention to it. It's fine.
[04:45:13] <quanticle> C's syntax is also fine.
[04:45:31] <quanticle> C has many problems, but curly braces isn't one of them.
[04:45:41] <feep> I also dislike lisp because of other things, but its syntax is in the top five
[04:45:48] <feep> C's syntax is incredibly dumb
[04:46:01] <feep> and that's not at all due to curly braces
[04:47:11] <quanticle> You don't like putting the type of a variable in front of the declaration? 
[04:47:25] <quanticle> You'd prefer foo: int rather than int foo?
[04:47:27] <spxtr> golang has it the other way around, and honestly I don't care either way
[04:47:34] <spxtr> you get used to it and move on
[04:47:48] <nshepperd2> C's syntax for arrays and pointers is dumb
[04:48:07] <quanticle> I'm not sure that's because of syntax or whether that's because in C an array *is* a pointer
[04:48:17] <nshepperd2> like declaring array types
[04:48:19] <shawwwn> I like (type)value casting though
[04:48:22] <quanticle> Oh
[04:48:23] <shawwwn> e.g. (char*)foo
[04:48:34] <shawwwn> casting operations need to be as effortless as that
[04:48:37] <quanticle> Oh, like char[] foo?
[04:48:39] <shawwwn> and pretty much every other language gets it wrong
[04:48:58] <feep> quanticle: no not at all
[04:49:11] <feep> I don't like wrapping the type of a variable lovingly *around* the namel.
[04:49:12] <quanticle> shawwwn: That's because if you're force casting, you're usually doing something that will bite you down the road
[04:49:14] <feep> name*
[04:49:32] <feep> I also don't like having dedicated namespaces for every single type of type
[04:49:34] <quanticle> And C lets you get away with it because "give the programmer enough rope to hang himself" is the general theme
[04:49:35] <dv2> in nim you write cast[int](varname), which is the best I think
[04:49:53] <feep> also don't like the preprocessor
[04:50:00] <feep> that's 40% of C in the trash right there
[04:50:02] <gwern> brb setting my pixel values to "chucknorris"
[04:50:16] <quanticle> Yeah, but C's preprocessor isn't part of the syntax
[04:50:20] <feep> it totally is
[04:50:44] <quanticle> You don't like the preprocessor or you don't like the preprocessor language?
[04:51:15] <feep> I mean, it actually literally is. part of the standard.
[04:51:28] <quanticle> Yes, but the standard covers more than just syntax
[04:51:28] <feep> I don't like the preprocessor semantics *and* the syntax.
[04:51:35] <quanticle> Okay
[04:51:42] <quanticle> That's totally fair
[04:51:49] <quanticle> I don't like the C preprocessor either
[04:52:38] <feep> so where we're at is, I don't like var decls, preproc syntax, type decls.. and I think you will find if you remove those, the remaining syntax is basically 20% of D
[04:52:40] <feep> which I love.
[04:53:01] <feep> in other words, I like C-likes, I just think C is one of the worse C-likes.
[04:53:05] <quanticle> Variable declarations? What's wrong with C's variable declarations?
[04:53:24] <feep> yeah what's (*wrong[])(with *them)?
[04:53:25] <quanticle> int foo = 3; seems to be fine
[04:53:27] <quanticle> Lol
[04:53:42] <quanticle> Okay, touché
[04:53:44] <feep> [02:20] <feep> I don't like wrapping the type of a variable lovingly *around* the name.
[04:53:55] <feep> this is C, not Python.
[04:54:24] <quanticle> Ironically Python's type annotations are far cleaner and don't wrap around the variable like that.
[04:54:31] <feep> yeah I just mean cause like
[04:54:36] <feep> python, wrapping
[04:54:40] <quanticle> No, I get it
[04:54:44] <feep> ^^
[04:56:01] <quanticle> Anyway, going back to Lisp, Lisp's syntax is fine, but I think its biggest mistake is that it only uses () for *everything*. Clojure uses (), [], and {}, and it's much nicer to look at IMO
[04:56:11] <feep> fair fair.
[04:56:51] <catern> feep: you mean you like Algol-likes
[04:56:58] <quanticle> ^
[04:57:01] <feep> catern: I think nobody has used algol
[04:57:07] <feep> to a first approximation
[04:57:15] <feep> so this would be a weird way to name them

[06:17:46] <kuudes> because even without mutations, omicron reinfects in about 6-10 months persons who have got infected in past

[06:18:09] <kuudes> maybe spread a bit larger period of time
[06:18:49] <kuudes> that is about 1/2 extra mortality per year compared to before covid at least here in finland

[06:20:35] <kuudes> either zerocovid or +1/2 mortality, and former may not be an actual option

[09:24:54] <quanticle> Okay, I have a question for you type theory nerds. I know you're awake. If I want to define a type that's the reverse of an array, what would that look like? Like, if I have Array<T> and I want a type that's the reverse of that... would that be a dependent type
[09:27:55] <quanticle> I can of course write (in Typescript, for example): const reverse = (input: Array<T>): Array<T> => { ... }, but I can make the function body { return input; } and it'd pass the typecheck
[09:31:50] <adiabatty> I'm only a pocket-protector sniffer when it comes to this stuff, but…
[09:33:05] <adiabatty> You might be able to solve a simpler problem with, say, 2-tuples and 3-tuples and 4-tuples, but if your tuple's type is [number, number], well, you're not gonna be able to get a type checker to save you
[09:33:39] <adiabatty> ditto for [number, string, number]

[09:45:12] <quanticle> So that paper I linked describes how you can use dependent types to enforce array invariants, and uses sorting functions as an example.

[09:45:34] <quanticle> I *think* you could use a similar approach to define a dependent type for an array reverse function?
[09:46:02] <quanticle> Yeah, dependent types are something that, afaik, are only in academic languages like Agda or Idris

[10:00:34] <quanticle> ""Rather than requiring users to annotate types with refinements, our approach attempts to learn quantified array invariants. Although significant advances havebeen made in recent years to allow useful array invariants to be inferred automatically, prior approaches either (a) require a predefined fixed or parameterized partition of array indices [10,14], (b) entail sophisticated reasoning over
[10:00:36] <quanticle> quantified abstract domains, or (c) rely on powerful theorem provers to provide predicates (as interpolants) that may hold on the program in general.

[23:14:45] <catern> okay I stand corrected, apparently there are open source reimplementations of the minecraft client, interesting
[23:16:11] <gwern> 'One group that shared members with Nerds Inc. was supplied with the locations of numerous bases which they raided, looting 200 million in-game items. They kept the exploit secret, creating fake stories behind the destruction of bases and gaslighting. They named the exploit "Nocom", short for "no comment". In 2021, another group called Infinity Incursion independently created a more primitive...

[23:21:34] <catern> the exploit is very pleasing
[23:21:38] <catern> quite simple and easy
[23:21:57] <gwern> (so how *do* new players escape the spawn area if it's completely walled off and trap-filled?)
[23:22:26] <catern> i'm guessing "assistance from already-established players"
[23:22:49] <catern> you can change your respawn point so as long as you get out once...
[23:25:41] <two2thehead> how would they fix this? Amateur suggestion, rate limit the number of requests to the server?
[23:25:48] <two2thehead> Detect it, rather
[23:26:42] <gwern> I think the most obvious thing would simply be better anomaly detection. "what are these people spamming 100 packets a second for seveal years getting out of it?"
[23:26:53] <two2thehead> hm.
[23:27:06] <two2thehead> okay, that's a better suggestion gwern +1
[23:27:19] <gwern> the packets *were* rate-limited, and the rate-limited reduced over time, so the ops knew about the attack. they just didn't know why
[23:27:35] <two2thehead> plus you can compare between the mean, median, mode requests per user and detect outliers
[23:27:43] <two2thehead> aah. yeah that makes more sense
[23:28:03] <gwern> so you have a Challenger scenario: your o-rings are not performing according to your predictions; the fact that nothing has *yet* gone wrong (like a space shuttle exploding) does not mean that everything is hunky-dory
[23:28:14] <two2thehead> then compare the members/accounts to each other.
[23:29:23] <Gurkenglas> Ooh, combat scene in mad investor chaos and the woman of Asmodeus. Luckily for Cheliax, someone who can cast Dominate Monster is on the scene.
[23:29:57] <catern> wait, the fix is obvious
[23:30:06] <catern> just don't allow block-punching out of render distance
[23:30:16] <gwern> it looks like pretty much any manual examination of the packets would have immediately led to an answer: "hm, let's look at a few thousand... they're all the same, checking a block, well, that's normal... but wait, they're all over the goddamn map, and they're all coming from 1 user, they can't possibly be in that many places at once, what's going on here? and their contents, they're...
[23:30:22] <gwern> ...returning valid information for each block? wtf?! wait, is this leaking information about any block? can I query any block on the map with my own user? ...well fuck. fuck fuck fuck fuck"
[23:31:04] <gwern> catern: like most cryptographic and anonymity problems, the biggest problem is realizing you have a problem
[23:31:39] <gwern> if you run a darknet market and your apache default settings let anyone query /server-status, your DNM will run perfectly, right up until the police image the server as the SWAT team kicks down your door
[23:31:40] <catern> agreed, just responding to two2thehead's question directly: the fix, once you know you have a problem, is not allowing punches out of render distance
[23:32:14] <two2thehead> huh
[23:32:17] <two2thehead> catern, +1
[23:32:27] <catern> better anomaly detection is one meta-fix 
[23:32:34] <two2thehead> sorry I was afk
[23:32:50] <gwern> and since they pride themselves on the permanent map, they can't even fix the leak retroactively by resetting the map
[23:33:01] <catern> taking privileg/capability-safety more seriously is another meta-fix
[23:33:13] <gwern> even abandoning all the bases, it's still a major resource as to what your enemies used to do and be
[23:33:15] <two2thehead> gwern, that was my next question 'What's the background setting on this server?'
[23:33:27] <catern> the "query a block" operation shouldn't be allowed without presenting a proof that you're in range of that block
[23:33:37] <two2thehead> catern, yep
[23:33:49] <gwern> (that's why they aren't releasing the db or high-resolution images, they still want to exploit it)
[23:34:15] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[23:34:31] <catern> it sounds like the map is pretty chaotic anyway
[23:34:43] <catern> and bases only live for a year or so
[23:34:49] <catern> so it seems it should quickly decay in useful
[23:34:50] <catern> ness
[23:35:27] <gwern> the further away from the origin, the longer lived bases would've been. and that's the bases that the tracking reveals
[23:35:48] <catern> yeah, I mean even the ones that are far from the origin
[23:35:58] <two2thehead> gwern, you can also do base-building-patterns per user
[23:36:08] <catern> I was just reading about some of the bases, even far away from origin they sound short-lived
[23:36:17] <catern> e.g. https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Avalonia
[23:36:17] <Robomot> Avalonia - 2b2t Wiki
[23:36:24] <two2thehead> get a sample set of bases, split them into training set vs test set
[23:36:30] <gwern> sounds like they've raided a lot of them already and used up the backlog, but it must've cut short enormously the lifespan of what would've been the longest lived bases
[23:36:41] <catern> true
[23:37:20] <catern> hm so you should really have to present a proof of how you reached a block in terms of the path you took
[23:37:57] <catern> the server should be able to validate that fairly cheaply, although you have to take block changes into account...

[23:38:38] <catern> but still, that's like, one obvious approach if you care about security at all; this is the result of not caring about security

[23:44:14] <adiabatic> yeah, think of how slowly Apple is adding secure replacements for everything to iOS and backporting them to macOS
[23:45:34] <Ralith> the server should already be authoritative about player position, so elaborate client-supplied proofs are unnecessary
[23:45:36] <catern> (it's not notch's fault anyway, it's the fault of the last 40 years of the entire field of CS)
[23:46:21] <gwern> information leaks are hard
[23:46:21] <catern> Ralith: maybe, it sounds like they had that in some sense but it had bad UX in the presence of lag
[23:46:45] <Gurkenglas> What I'm confused about is why Security didn't just teleport Keltham to a stronghold with the teleport scroll they're supposed to have for the pretend-escape plan instead of telling Keltham to go back into the teleportation-doesn't-work zone.
[23:46:50] <Ralith> if your server's not authoritative about basic gameplay like that you have way bigger problems

[23:49:20] <gwern> Ralith: I think the idea here is that if it was a capability system, then when they wrote the wrong desync fix, the capability would be explicit or it'd break: so it would require the client to either be explicitly given the God Object of omniscience, provide just the right scoped capability and not be vulnerable, or it would fail when a client provided no capability
[23:50:08] <gwern> as opposed to having ambient global root authority locked down by MACs checking "is this block in sight?" "is that block in sight?" "is this other block in sight?" and as soon as you miss a check...
[23:50:53] <catern> ya what gwern said. if you're capability-oriented as a matter of habit you avoid this security issue "for free"
