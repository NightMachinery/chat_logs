[22:07:40] <vxla> Is there a way to append a domain name to emails sent from systems that only send user@host? For instance, on openbsd the /etc/daily sends mail at the end of its work. It looks like this: 
[22:07:44] <vxla> [ -s $MAINOUT ] && mail -s "`hostname` daily insecurity output" root < $MAINOUT
[22:08:16] <vxla> Can we append example.org onto that so mail arrives as root@host.example.org instead of root@host ?
[22:36:51] <vortexx> vxla: add an alias for root in /etc/mail/hosts and run newaliases
[22:39:05] <vxla> vortexx: that's already done but it still will deliver as root@edge in the To: field, which triggers some spam filters.
