[00:39:27] <stenno> there is also no reason to not implement a feature just because another language has implemented it
[00:41:37] <Blondie101010> stenno:  there used to be a time where a language used variable declarations and another didn't
[00:41:59] <Blondie101010> and that was actually one main distinction between them
[00:42:32] <Blondie101010> I'm not saying it's a bad thing in the universal scope...  I'm saying you prefer another language you have in mind, so go use that language
[00:44:23] <stenno> i understand what you are saying, but changing your language just because you cannot do that specific type of declaration is a bit rash
[00:47:02] <Blondie101010> don't worry, I wouldn't ban your from using the language, though it'd be very tempting to ban people from voting on changing a proper language into something else
[00:47:25] <biberu> stenno: are you using any other languages?
[00:47:31] <stenno> yes
[00:47:55] <Blondie101010> every of these "options" the language gets to support will break it apart considerably
[00:48:19] <stenno> js, which doesn't have type declarations
[00:48:25] <biberu> stenno: right, was just curious about the wording there, "changing _your_ language"
[00:48:32] <Blondie101010> it won't be *one* language in the end but a language family
[00:48:40] <stenno> changing the language you choose to use for this project
[00:49:04] <stenno> if thats possible
[00:49:34] <Blondie101010> I hope that won't happen as I like PHP,  but it seems to be the direction it's going with the amount of *accomodations* it's doing

[00:50:19] <stenno> they are still optional
[00:51:41] <biberu> stenno: why not just use a statically typed language that already can express what you need though?
[00:54:05] <Blondie101010> exactly my point

[00:55:04] <Blondie101010> isn't it obvious?
[00:55:16] <Blondie101010> variable typing is a MAJOR language redefinition
[00:55:39] <Blondie101010> it would change everything
[00:55:57] <biberu> oh, is that a suggestion? you mean for local variables?
[00:56:06] <Blondie101010> and I'm not against strict typing, but I am against breaking a good language
[00:59:19] <biberu> Blondie101010: if that was it, how would it break it?
[01:01:40] <Blondie101010> it would change the language completely
[01:02:02] <Blondie101010> everything is designed to support type juggling and avoid strict declarations
[01:02:38] <Blondie101010> I'm not saying it can't be done, but it would become 2 distinct PHP languages

[01:07:17] <biberu> just so I'm understanding correctly, it's about something like $foo: string = ""?
[01:16:32] <Blondie101010> yes
[01:16:43] <Blondie101010> that's a variable type declaration
[01:17:12] <Blondie101010> it changes the whole language's usage
[01:17:57] <biberu> do you generally mix types in your locals? or what's the issue?
[01:18:09] <stenno> are you also someone who uses == instead of === ?
[01:22:41] <Blondie101010> it depends if it matters or not...  but that wouldn't be a question if you made the language typed
[01:23:03] <Blondie101010> it would fail at the compilation phase
[01:24:04] <stenno> thats why i was asking
[01:24:11] <__adrian> "stenno> there is also no reason to not implement ..."  actually there is; risk of introducing instability/complexity for no reason.
[01:25:21] <biberu> Blondie101010: some might see that as a pro, but if that's a feature you want there are options too ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[01:25:24] <Byteflux> Blondie101010: I do actually use other languages, too but I have had a chance to play with Python 3's typing stuff and thoroughly enjoyed it. IMO, if PHP wants to do type declarations, it should go all the way and not half ass it :)
[01:26:05] <Byteflux> But it's a personal preference and I won't be totally destroyed if such an RFC gets rejected
[01:26:21] <Blondie101010> Byteflux:  which implies a major change
[01:26:33] <Blondie101010> make your own new language based off PHP instead
[01:27:18] <Byteflux> I won't pretend to understand the full scope of the change but it's not as though the language hasn't had major changes in the past, although it has kept a good track record with backwards compatibility.
[01:27:43] <biberu> is there a link to an rfc or something?
[01:28:14] <Byteflux> It's not something that "if PHP doesn't implement it, I'm upset and won't use PHP" so I can't help but feel maybe you're overreacting to my opinion. I'm not going to invent my own language for a feature I'd hopefully would be one day added to PHP (I could just use another language if I really wanted)
[01:29:16] <Byteflux> biberu: Not sure if there is one that encompasses the scope of generics I'm talking about.
[01:29:49] <biberu> Byteflux: there are plenty of alternatives with powerful type systems available though
[01:30:10] <Byteflux> Definitely. I already have well versed in Java and Python, which is where my preference for typing comes from
[01:30:20] <Byteflux> s/have/am/
[01:32:12] <biberu> Byteflux: so why php?
[01:33:16] <Byteflux> biberu: Market dominance, mainly.
[01:35:39] <biberu> ah
[01:41:14] <stenno> it is my job for me
[01:41:22] <stenno> in private projects i would not use php
[01:42:55] <stenno> i like all the recent changes, it makes writing in it much more easy
[01:43:57] <stenno> in general, you could also argue that even though language features use the same or similar syntax, they will behave totally different
[01:48:50] <Byteflux> Yeah I feel that. I appreciate that as long as I know PHP, I'll never have trouble getting work :P
[01:49:31] <Byteflux> But definitely not my goto for hobby projects.
[01:49:35] <Reinhilde> word
[01:53:53] <stenno> i like to think (without have _any_ knowledge about compilers and the like) that being able to assert types will also make things faster under the hood
[01:54:26] <Blondie101010> that would involve a new engine
[01:54:33] <Blondie101010> that's not how it works
[01:54:57] <Byteflux> Has there been any languages that transpile to PHP?
[01:55:00] <Blondie101010> any type error in PHP happens at run time, not compilation time
[01:55:10] <Byteflux> Specifically designed for that, I mean. Kind of like TypeScript is to JavaScript
[01:55:45] <Byteflux> True, but the usefulness of typing extends to static analysis, possibly even the most important aspect of it tbh

[01:57:34] <Blondie101010> I don't mind either, but how would you handle ensuring that two packages are compatible?  by defining phpA and phpB to describe and validate?
[01:57:59] <Blondie101010> it would become a different language
[01:58:44] <Blondie101010> frankly, to me that sounds like the major problems with C 30 years ago
[01:59:18] <Blondie101010> you could not get your code to compile on a different C compiler without planning ahead some gimmicks or customizing it
[01:59:34] <__adrian> i'm a little late, but reading back through that i get the impression people don't realize how big a change type declarations would be
[01:59:43] * Blondie101010 nods
[02:00:37] <__adrian> e.g., "should go all the way and not half ass it" // existing tools like type hints and typed properties have nothing to do with making variables themselves typed - it's just guards
[02:00:56] <__adrian> the "type" of a typehint belongs to the function, for example
[02:01:16] <__adrian> it all applies on access, and that's it.
[02:01:57] <__adrian> and that's not speaking at all to the issue of how fundamentally it would change the language
[02:02:15] <__adrian> honestly, dynamic typing is not a flaw
[02:02:37] <Blondie101010> correct, that was a choice
[02:02:38] <__adrian> everyone comes at it from the perspective of it being a problem that no one's been able to solve in 20 years
[02:03:18] <Reinhilde> mmm
[02:03:26] <__adrian> it's an advantage in certain domains (e.g., http). and it's nothing more or less than a choice in others
[02:04:04] <Byteflux> Yeah I don't want to trivialize the effort that would be required or even make any assumption that the language will be better off for it. I won't say dynamic typing is downright flawed but I do see a trend that is we see languages starting to slowly move away from it or at least start to support stronger typing.
[02:04:09] <__adrian> i write "types" code basically all the time. the fact that the vars are not _literally_ typed doesn't make any difference
[02:04:20] <Blondie101010> I might actually be interested in the new typed language, but it would not be PHP anymore
[02:04:27] <stenno> i don't see it as a problem, but i like to have tools which make things stricter
[02:04:49] <stenno> after all its only relevant for the programmer
[02:05:07] <__adrian> * "typed"
[02:05:11] <stenno> type declaration, that is
[02:05:17] <__adrian> right
[02:05:36] <Blondie101010> feel free to use Java :P
[02:06:04] <stenno> i find this 'just use another language' argument a bit weak ngl
[02:06:14] <Byteflux> With how popular PHP is, I'm kind of surprised nobody's done a language like this which just transpiles to PHP haha
[02:06:33] <__adrian> well, the counter to that is "why not just make one language"
[02:06:52] <__adrian> ugh  :p  transpileing
[02:07:40] <Byteflux> Kind of like how TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. It accepts valid Java syntax but introduces a powerful typing system
[02:07:45] <Byteflux> JavaScipt*
[02:07:52] <Byteflux> Ugh, can't spell today :)
[02:08:45] <stenno> __adrian: but the way those features are handled is totally different for each langauge
[02:09:16] <Blondie101010> it would be the case for your new PHP-based typed language
[02:10:08] <Blondie101010> it would arguably be more efficient, probably a good 1-3% by today's standards :)
[02:12:32] <biberu> Byteflux: doesn't e.g. haxe compile to php? don't know how good it is, but either way it would be hard to use in existing projects, and hard to market yourself with to a php audience too
[02:12:37] <stenno> i think i am beginning to understand what you mean with 'changing the language'
[02:13:08] <Blondie101010> it would become incompatible with itself
[02:13:37] <Blondie101010> not a simple BC problem..  it would affect everything using it
[02:13:50] <biberu> __adrian: i don't see the issue with typed properties tbh, what makes it that different from any other hinted expression?
[02:14:00] <stenno> so introducing such a language feature would require a lot of adjustments to all different parts of the php compiler specs which makes it difficult to implement without breaking save compat?
[02:14:17] <Blondie101010> biberu:  he already mentioned this....  type hints are not type declarations
[02:14:35] <Blondie101010> that makes a big difference
[02:14:53] <Byteflux> biberu: Never heard of it but looks interesting. I think the major goal with such a language would be that you can still hook into the same ecosystem. It's pointless to make a language that transpiles to PHP if you can't use PHP libraries within it.
[02:15:19] <Blondie101010> function foo(int $num = 3) { $num ='three'; } // is valid PHP
[02:15:53] <biberu> Byteflux: that's tricky even with ts/js interop
[02:15:58] <Blondie101010> that's the way dynamic languages operate
[02:17:17] <biberu> Blondie101010: well aware, but why would you want that?
[02:17:19] <Blondie101010> if it were in C, the compilation step would be MUCH longer and it would fail then and there, not at run time like it currently does for type hints
[02:17:36] <Blondie101010> the point is not the why, it's the how
[02:17:50] <Blondie101010> those two languages would operate completely differently
[02:18:01] <biberu> even if you accept the hint vs. declaration that looks like a bug waiting to happen
[02:18:36] <Blondie101010> it was not meant to be a good programming example, but an example of the major difference
[02:18:45] <__adrian> biberu: i'm distinguishing between runtime checks (what php has now) vs. an actual in-engine restriction on the var's type (which is what i think most people are imagining)
[02:18:55] <Byteflux> it's valid at compile time but still runs into runtime error with strict types, right?
[02:19:12] <Blondie101010> Byteflux:  PHP won't care if what you assign
[02:19:15] <__adrian> what is?
[02:19:23] <Byteflux> The function above, Blondie101010's example
[02:19:28] <BadAdviceCat>  
[02:19:29] <Blondie101010> it's valid
[02:19:32] <__adrian> no
[02:19:35] <__adrian> it's _always_ valid
[02:19:53] <biberu> __adrian: i was imagining runtime checks just like for e.g. arguments, the latter would clearly be a major change
[02:20:01] <__adrian> (int $num)  is a runtime check. it's performed on _ccess_ (when the arg is passed into the function).
[02:20:04] <Blondie101010> and all type juggling that any script has ever used would be broken
[02:20:10] <__adrian> ^^
[02:20:18] <__adrian> i gotta run, but yes. that and everything else
[02:20:22] <__adrian> later  :)
[02:22:28] <Byteflux> oh yeah i see now, for some reason I was thinking $num = 'str' would trigger a runtime error with strict types enabled but I realize now >_>
[02:26:33] <Blondie101010> that would only be the tip of the iceberg
[02:27:06] <Blondie101010> I wasn't exaggerating when I said it would imply a whole new engine
[02:29:24] <Byteflux> In many ways though, PHP today does feel like a new language compared to when I started PHP, I think around 4.1 or thereabout
[02:30:35] <Blondie101010> yet surprisingly it had few breaking changes
[02:31:40] <Byteflux> It does have backwards incompatible features that you can opt into, but yeah probably nothing to the extent that requires a major engine rewrite.
[02:31:52] <Byteflux> Though I don't know how extensive the ZE changes were going from ZE2 to 3

[13:18:08] <The_Blode> Good morning.
[13:18:20] <The_Blode> I'm having an issue with my PHP page on my Pi.
[13:18:37] <The_Blode> I believe it is a permissions issue. Can I ask here or do I need to go the Pi channel?
[13:18:58] <Rockwood> what is Pi?
[13:19:54] <The_Blode> Raspberry Pi
[13:22:13] <Rockwood> whats the error?
[13:28:00] <The_Blode> I have a page with PHP code in it and it's not displaying on the page.
[13:28:12] <The_Blode> It's just showing "; echo " as plain text
[13:34:30] <AllenJB> The_Blode: Does the URL bar in the browser show an http:// or https:// URL, or a file:// URL?
[13:34:57] <The_Blode> http://
[13:35:31] <AllenJB> If you view source in the browser, can you see the php code (<?php tags and whatever's inside them)?
[13:36:14] <The_Blode> No
[13:36:54] <The_Blode> I can see what's inside the php tags...well partially.
[13:37:00] <The_Blode> Can't see the PHP tags
[13:37:11] <AllenJB> It sounds to me like you have a typo (perhaps mismatched quotes) that is causing some of your PHP code to be inside a string.
[13:37:47] <The_Blode> Thanks AllenJB let me have a look
[13:38:03] <AllenJB> If you can't spot it, pastebin your code, paste the link here and we'll take a look
[13:41:34] <The_Blode> I think the code is sound. I fixed this once before. It had something to do with setting permissions on the /var/html/www directory.
[13:41:59] <The_Blode> But I've seen so many posts about it doing it a variety of different ways...and me not fully understanding what is happening has just confused me.
[13:42:04] <Rockwood> The_Blode, assume things just see the facts
[13:42:20] <Rockwood> The_Blode, don't assume the things just see the facts
[13:42:42] <The_Blode> Well, the page works just fine under Xampp so I've been developing the page there.

[13:42:52] <Rockwood> lol
[13:43:08] <Rockwood> Xampp means mishappeing
[13:43:10] <The_Blode> But I want to develop it on my Pi
[13:45:37] <Rockwood> what happens if you do <?php echo 'Current PHP version: ' . phpversion(); ?>
[13:47:47] <AllenJB> Are you using '<?' tags in your code (not '<?=' or '<?php')? If so, you may need to enable short_open_tags (or change your code to use full tags)
[13:48:59] <Rockwood> short tags isn't good idea
[13:50:29] <The_Blode> Let me see
[13:50:36] <The_Blode> I always use full PHP tags
