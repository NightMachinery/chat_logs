[13:29:57] <DPA> M6piz7wk[m]: If you are the sole copyright holder of a project (you wrote every line of code and so on), you can change any license at any time. But I think it's not retroactive, so anyone who got it with the old one, still has it with the old one.
[13:31:26] <M6piz7wk[m]> Rather needed a stub license that wouldn't block contribution and allowed me to change the license later 
[13:32:11] <M6piz7wk[m]> bcs the relevant code governs all of my projects and i want the license to be flexible based on what elected officials vote on where contributors influence the constitution
[13:32:21] <M6piz7wk[m]> but needs more research in that 🤔
[13:33:35] * M6piz7wk[m] wants to avoid scenario with a huge project that has a licensing issue that can't be fixed bcs the contributors can't be reached or are deceased

[19:53:52] <Anton> hiya: most people here would probably prefer 100% free software distros, but Ubuntu isn't bad. Trisquel is based on it, for example

[19:59:26] <hiya> M6piz7wk[m]: Xen? You mean VM?
[19:59:40] <M6piz7wk[m]> Xen is not just VM
[19:59:54] <M6piz7wk[m]> it's supervisor 
[20:01:14] <hiya> Yes, dedicated resources that cannot be oversold unlike LXD/LXC/KVM

[20:24:21] <Kaiod> M6piz7wk[m]: A word of advice, if you pass any category of risk or any threat, from major to minor, it is important that you don't make it as clear as you are making it now. You don't have to be one to talk about it, you can ask about it quietly here, just avoid undue self-exposure.
[20:25:35] <M6piz7wk[m]> i rather like the opportunity to poke people to see what happens in case i need to adjust my threat model :p

[20:28:16] <M6piz7wk[m]> and i am not really a high treat target just politically active so worst case scenario from that is political opponents making out things about me like being pedophile and alike to try to ruin my life 
[20:28:42] <M6piz7wk[m]> but that only applies to entities that are stupid enough to believe it like ~~codeberg~~
[20:29:41] <Kaiod> M6piz7wk[m]: In fact, this is a very bad tactic, even if this is a methodology based on more robust social engineering, precisely because the secretive attack is more incisive in the activity, than the poking of a stick.
[20:29:58] <M6piz7wk[m]> or trying to make up things to get me swatted based on things that allegedly leaked from my devices which was an issue in the past

[20:32:40] <Kaiod> M6piz7wk[m]: Well, in the politically active sphere, being succinct and transparent in the information about yourself is of great importance for any segment in politics. I say precisely, because I am politically active around here, the difference, is that it is an approach from a technologically different category.
[20:32:56] <M6piz7wk[m]> Kaiod: Rather i don't have a political agenda that would give anyone reasoning to perform such actions as they are resource demanding and would be waste without achieving anything

[20:33:53] <M6piz7wk[m]> since politically i pose as an advisor and provide researched topic with expert opinion on the subject.. i don't have political power to push any agenda 
[20:36:03] <Kaiod> M6piz7wk[m]: It may be that it does, but it also may not. By not knowing the intentions of your invader, or the rash interactions of your political opponent, you could get into trouble if you become influential in the future. 
[20:37:35] <Kaiod> M6piz7wk[m]: I'm sure that those you advise would like to know that they are safe in your remote or in-person presence, so it's important to assure them of this by all means.

[20:39:10] <M6piz7wk[m]> true but nothing that can be done about it and my politics are based around optimizing politics so that everyone is happy so i am not giving anyone reasons to do such things
[20:42:34] <Kaiod> M6piz7wk[m]: The point is that it doesn't always require a very well-planned intention for such an act, based on the fact that people have hasty judgments about others, which often do not reflect the conduct or work of the other. People may do such acts for fun, or just to look for something to motivate them to continue this; the possibilities are many and the list of possible motives infinite.
[20:43:25] <kompowiec> I do not know how yall are but in Poland many companies have resigned from google maps to OSM due to google maps license fees
[20:44:06] <kompowiec> and even in city buses you can see your position on the map with the help of OSM render.
[20:46:53] <Kaiod> kompowiec: This is quite common, especially when looking at the impact of the pandemic on the global economy. In fact, sometimes it can be for double advantage, citing the economic issue and the interest of society. However, many times, it is just to keep the cost-cutting bias, as an example, the Government of Brazil, which basically treats open source and free software as one, always citing the cost-benefit issue, and a line about the social impact.
[20:48:04] <kompowiec> EU it is also interested in libre software for be independent of the US and China.
[20:48:05] <M6piz7wk[m]> Kaiod: True, but better to be aware of those and be prepared for it then keeping it secret
[20:50:55] <Kaiod> M6piz7wk[m]: True, but secrecy is not necessary, nor is exposure. Thinking shrewdly in times of distrust, and analyzing the applicable context are great differentiators.

[20:57:14] <Kaiod> M6piz7wk[m]: Irrationality can be comforting, but it can throw you off a cliff into the abyss of doom and disillusionment. We must not be totally rational or irrational, we must be oscillatingly balanced, so that our thoughts do not become our worst enemy.
[20:58:28] <kompowiec> in other words, everyone has to be their own gatekeeper.
[20:59:47] <Kaiod> kompowiec: Precisely, no one will know how to deal with the situation you are going through better than yourself!
[21:00:02] <kompowiec> exactly
[21:00:35] <kompowiec> worse when even the people I ask have no idea either.
[21:01:04] <kompowiec> but this is just my personal digression.
[21:01:17] <Kaiod> We can try to advise, and indeed try to understand the situation and the context that applies, but we will never know exactly everything about what you go through, and we will deal with what is passed on to us.

[21:39:20] <White_Flame> that doesn't require "cloud"
[21:40:05] <White_Flame> (eg, renting from somebody's specific service, which still is a wrong use of "cloud" which implies that the service is unknown but compatible)
[21:41:53] <kompowiec> > for everything these days, backup off-site is much needed for anything important
[21:41:55] <kompowiec>  i remind that you can talk here often with ascetics who use sites that work exclusively with LibreJS
