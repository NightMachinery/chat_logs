[00:04:37] <robert_> so I'm using a Debian Bullseye server for an SMTP server, but it isn't accepting port 25 or 465 publicly (it's a linode)
[00:05:29] *** Quits: Kvothe (~weechat@user/elodin) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[00:05:37] <Blondie101010> is it because of your system or a Linode block?
[00:05:52] <sney> verify with 'ss -ltnp' as root that your MTA is listening on those ports, check if linode included some firewall configuration in their image (debian doesn't, but linode is known to change things) 
[00:05:54] <Blondie101010> 465 is blocked in *many* places and so is 25
[00:06:03] <sney> and check linode's documentation about whether you are allowed to host email
[00:06:30] <Blondie101010> hosting something on port 465 is really looking for trouble
[00:06:36] <Blondie101010> if you don't realize that, just don't
[00:07:02] <robert_> I'm using linode's firewall service to negate that

[00:07:18] <Blondie101010> you can't allow what is blocked at another layer
[00:07:33] <sney> it's not that unusual to host mail in the cloud, I know digitalocean and ovh allow it, but it is something that you have to do deliberately because malware will also try to do it 
[00:07:46] <robert_> yes
[00:07:51] <sney> if linode's policy is that you can't host email, then that's that 
[00:08:05] <robert_> I have 465 open on another linode

[00:29:06] <Blondie101010> robert_:  now you got me confused....  didn't you say it was blocked?  how would you establish that if you don't know how to test it?
[00:29:39] <Blondie101010> use https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/
[00:30:08] <robert_> because I can connect to it from the server itself ($publicip, localhost), port 25.
[00:30:24] <Blondie101010> not what I asked
[00:30:33] <Blondie101010> how do you know it doesn't work from the outside/
[00:30:54] <Blondie101010> test it on my link and lets see what it shows
[00:31:16] <robert_> because I get HELO from the server itself, but not from my IP address (it's allowed through linode's firewall service)
[00:31:51] <Blondie101010> please just test it on my link

When I send a PDF however, it says processing and then just flips to completed without printing anything. I've tried watching the logs, but there's no error of any substance there that I can see, unless I'm missing something...https://pastebin.com/TN39f49M

[07:17:31] <sgon> fling: thanks a lot for the reply. torbrowser doesn't really work here. The speed is too slow. Open a plain webpage (without image/video) will take more than two minutes in my place.

[07:21:59] <sgon> yeah, i tried that. but it doesn't really work. It's tough to select a VPN service in my place. Most of the solutions won't work. I need to buy expensive service to get online.

[09:25:12] <Nightmarcus> Can somebody remind me of something?  I don't have any issues, but I don't remember how (or whether) I configured something ages ago.  System emails for alerts and stuff that get sent to "root" actually arrive in the mailbox for my regular user account.  For example, the email messages show up as being sent to "root@server" but I can see the messages in the mailbox of my regular old "user@server" without having to become root.

[17:50:32] <at0m> yea, jack's only needed when routing between applications really. other than that, it's just an extra layer on top of alsa. plus, jack adds a buffer of latency, depending on the setup
[17:51:16] <at0m> unlike some might think, jack doesn't automagically lower latency or so. at best, it doesn't add any.
[17:51:26] <n4dir> to me audio is at minimum very hard to understand. I know that jack for me is exaggerated, but it is at least easy.

[19:54:59] <jelly> sputnik, apparently it takes time for the LVM VG (volume group) to become available, and the initramfs code loops/waits until it finds it
[19:55:24] <sputnik> jelly: is that because of my crappy LSI 2008 controller?
[19:55:45] <kittonian> hi all. I couldn't find a channel directly related to my question so I thought perhaps someone here might know. When I was transferring files via FTP they came in exactly as they were from my app server without any modification, however with the new version of my app server, FTP is no longer a thing and I have to use WebDAV instead. What's happening is it is rendering the pages, so what is transferred is equivalent to me viewing
[19:55:45] <kittonian>  the page source in a web browser, instead of it retaining the code exactly as I have written it (which is what I need).

[19:56:29] <jelly> sputnik, it's a combination of controller, driver, number of disks and paths to disks if you have multipath in play, and how kernel finds them.  You can ignore the issue if systems boot reliably.
[19:57:35] <jelly> a VM will have a much cleaner disk situation and virtualized disks appear and become ready much faster
[19:58:16] <sputnik> jelly: yeah, it boots alrite. there's no multipath and there's just one mirror array. i guess mpt2sas_cm0 / LSI SAS2008 controller combination is the culprit
[19:58:38] <jelly> hw mirror or md raid?
[19:58:47] <sputnik> hw
[19:59:22] <sputnik> but a also tried to install it on just a single, unmirrored disk, and the same thing happens
[19:59:23] <jelly> then it's weird, because BIOS will prepare that logical disk in advance
[19:59:56] <sputnik> it is weird. but it also happens if i use the disks as a passthrough on the controller
[20:00:30] <jelly> there are different variants of firmware for those controllers, right?  One that's better for raid mode, and one that's better if you use raw disks, hba mode.

[20:01:00] <jelly> if you use passthrough you probably want to go with md raid and ignore hw raid completely
[20:01:02] <sputnik> jelly: yup, i tried both, IT and IR. no difference..
[20:01:12] <jelly> no idea then
[20:01:40] <sputnik> well, i guess it's just an ancient controller

[22:38:48] <f-a> I would like to stream, say, a coding session, but I do not have a twitch or youtube account.

[22:40:14] <kek_> apparently I also need clang 1 but I'm stuck with clang 7. In those extra repos I only found clang 11 installed as clang-11 instead of clang. I added alises for clang and clang++ and also exported compiler flags for cmake but for some reason cmake keeps uses 7. Am I forgetting something? Is there a way to just update clang to the newest version without any special versionized names?
[22:41:16] <greycat> I think there's some way to override the compiler that cmake wants to use, but cmake is a nightmare wrapped in a horror movie wrapped in a prisoner of war camp, so good luck trying to figure it out.

[22:44:27] <kek_> greycat, yeah I thought those are that env variables I set... sadly the codebase is rather huge and has install scripts and not just simply "cmake .. make " kind of workflow. it's weird. thanks, gonna read more about setting compiler then.

[23:00:54] <f-a> vampirefrog: after searching a bit, I found that peertube actually allows lives (rather: some instances are) and am messing with OBS
[23:01:11] <f-a> I suppose it will be faster than my own virtual server
[23:01:48] <vampirefrog> f-a: yeah you can make your own streaming site but you might want to consider streaming on existing platorms so people can discover you, I've been streaming on dlive for a couple of years and people actually find my streams and follow
[23:01:59] <vampirefrog> you can also multistream for free to 4 platforms with restream.io
