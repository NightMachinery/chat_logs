[00:12:09] <Stanley> I have user generated input I'm storing, which is fine, but when I need to output it I'm running into some troubles
[00:12:42] <Stanley> Main issue being if you put a newline in a textarea it stores it as an actual newline \r but if you output that text you need to nl2br() it
[00:13:10] <Stanley> but if you nl2br you need to output the results unescaped otherwise the <br /> displays as text not html
[00:13:42] <Stanley> in which case their <script>alert('hi');</script> and other various tags can run
[00:16:58] <Stanley> should I be running strip_tags(), then nl2br, then storing it, and then outputting it since it's been sanitized?

[01:06:43] <__adrian> in your case, you need to know whether you're storing text or html.
[01:07:42] <__adrian> if you're storing text, you store it as-is and use htmlspecialchars() as blondie noted. if, AFTER that, you want to convert newlines to <br>, you can use nl2br (or, some other string replacement process).
[01:08:27] <__adrian> if you're storing html, then you need to parse and filter your input so you know it's all stuff you want to accept. you need a tool like htmltidy for this.
[01:09:05] <__adrian> in either case, if the input contains something you don't want/allow, you REJECT it outright. you should NEVER "sanitize" or "fix" input.
[01:10:30] <__adrian> also note in both cases, you don't do encoding for output untill you actually output (e.g., you do NOT store htmlspecialchars($input), but $input).

[02:46:30] <Nekomander> dag, you should have a separate feedRepo, which saves the feeds.
[02:48:10] <dag> yes. and who should be responsible for persisting to the many-to-many table?
[02:50:54] <Blondie101010> dag:  by the way I just looked at your code, and it looks nice, but it has typical problems I would have expected by such a tool
[02:50:54] <Nekomander> That is one kind of implementation, ANOTHER kind of implementation involves Repositories having no save() or add() methods. Which is better imo, because if all you want to do is save/add records, you will not need to have a bunch of different repositories to save many different kinds of Entities/objects.
[02:51:26] <Blondie101010> definitely, that is why destructors exist
[02:51:52] <Blondie101010> if your dependencies are well ordered, it's the cleanest design
[02:54:33] <deltab> dag: I suggest you separate the insert/update SQL generation from the entity-to-row conversion
[02:55:08] <Nekomander> dag, The "other kind of object" is called the EntityManager, or the UnitOfWOrk. You can look it up here https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/unitOfWork.html - Doctrine already does this via their EntityManager.
[02:56:04] <Nekomander> So 2 different repositories. The kind WITH save/add() method, another kind WITHOUT the save/add() method (the saving is done via UnitOfWork)
[02:56:32] <Nekomander> Actually, there are more kinds of repositories.
[02:59:57] <Nekomander> So basically More than 1 entities if you wish to pull out objects/records.  Unit of work to save several different kinds of objects without the involvement of repositories.
[03:03:37] <dag> i like what im hearing. so repos can be lazer focused on a single model and not be cluttered with persistence logic for relationships

[05:43:25] <__adrian> but yeah, not what i'd expect.
[05:43:46] <__adrian> BUT execute() is returning true - that means sqlite told it the query ran fine
[05:44:04] <dag> return value from execute is true for me too
[05:44:22] <Blondie101010> think you may have a real bug
[05:44:24] <__adrian> that means sqlite is not returning an error
[05:44:48] <__adrian> or possibly that the sqlite driver is quashing it
[05:45:14] <__adrian> well - nvm that. driver == db, so yeah, it's the driver
[05:45:32] <Blondie101010> wanted to be sure that it reports other errors, and it does :/
[05:46:19] <Blondie101010> butttt, is this really a bug, or could it be expected?
[05:46:57] <Blondie101010> did it succeed in deleting nothing?  I think so
[05:48:47] <dag> it deleted nothing
[05:49:00] <Blondie101010> I know :)

[05:53:10] <dag> ok got it. a check foregone for performance gain im guessing then
[05:56:55] <Blondie101010> it is not really an error

[07:05:32] <__adrian> what do you mean, exactly?

[08:17:39] <__adrian> i also like `use` as an indication of names code in a particular file depends on. but i don't disagree with the warning.
[08:18:16] <Nekomander> I know for hell sure all error reporting and etc is set to -1, ready to break at a drop of a hat.
[08:18:58] <Nekomander> Well, TIL. :)
[08:21:03] <Nekomander> dag, anyway, you can use namespace like so: https://3v4l.org/mT5I5 - IMO, that should be the name of the software.   namespace Dag\AwesomeWare;
[08:22:27] <dag> it's just a code sample. or dod you mean adding a namespace solves the problem?
[08:23:24] <Nekomander> dag, it's NOT to solve the problem.
[08:24:10] <Blondie101010> dag:  no
[08:24:23] <Blondie101010> not sure what causes it...  it works without parameters
[08:25:00] <dag> it's a sql problem which im not good at hehe. the where statement doesnt work
[08:25:24] <Blondie101010> yes it does
[08:25:31] <Blondie101010> if I remove the parameters, it works
[08:25:34] <Nekomander> Adding namespace IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE is to serve these purposes: 1. Allow for using `use PDO;` for purely coding style/contention purposes. 2. Reason for why? So that any person who reads that script can know that particular script depends on `PDO` because `use PDO;` is written at the top of the file.
[08:26:09] <Nekomander> code convention*
[08:26:23] <dag> https://3v4l.org/GYTAZ
[08:26:57] <Nekomander> Knowing what the script depends on, without having to read a bunch of lines of code, checking for instances of PDO being used anywhere in that file, or doing a `CTRL+F`
[08:27:20] <Blondie101010> dag: https://3v4l.org/ls0M1 is what I'm talking about
[08:27:24] <Blondie101010> your SQL is fine
[08:27:53] <dag> yeah i tried that too Blondie101010 which is very weird. it doesnt work with prepared statement
[08:28:10] <Blondie101010> it does in that link
[08:28:29] <Blondie101010> I agree something is wrong
[08:28:36] <Blondie101010> just saying it's not the SQL
[08:28:36] <__adrian> it's the parameters, not the prepare
[08:28:51] <__adrian> is odd. no idea.
[08:30:18] <Blondie101010> I even tried naming them and it also failed
[08:31:36] <Nekomander> dag, can't run a bunch of SQL commands all in 1 go, you may only do 1 a time, unless you change a PDO option, but on the condition you do, you will lose genuine prepared statement capability.
[08:31:52] <Blondie101010> Nekomander: that's not the problem
[08:32:00] <Blondie101010> the data does get loaded properly
[08:32:13] <Blondie101010> it's the darn parameters
[08:32:18] <Blondie101010> can't get any to work
[08:32:39] <Blondie101010> I wonder if it's something on 3v4l
[08:33:32] <Blondie101010> nope
[08:34:50] <dag> the feed_id isnt defined with a datatype so sqlite defaults to text or something. if i add feed_id integer it worked.
[08:35:02] <dag> jesus
[08:35:34] <Blondie101010> oh
[08:35:50] <Blondie101010> that is so frigging weird
[08:38:21] <jaggz> can't find the default in the docs [yet].. one page says 'we can assume it's blob', another says numeric.
[08:39:27] <Blondie101010> anyways, it was caused by that missing type which lead to this awkward behaviour
[08:39:42] <Blondie101010> not something that can be reproduced in SQL directly
[08:40:01] <Blondie101010> but it obviously affects the prepare process
[08:40:04] <Nekomander> dag, should make it a habit to fully type out the table creation command. :D
[08:41:43] <dag> yeah. sqlite column types are mostly text i read so the datatypes are just hints. ive been in textmode here
[08:42:10] <__adrian> "...so the datatypes are just hints"  it's not quite that simple
[08:42:47] <dag> alright. more info here https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html
[08:43:17] <__adrian> note that also has your answer; without a type declaration the affinity is NUMERIC
[08:43:49] <TinoDidriksen> No
[08:43:57] <TinoDidriksen> If the declared type for a column contains the string "BLOB" or if no type is specified then the column has affinity BLOB.
[08:44:02] <Blondie101010> if that was the case, it should have worked
[08:44:04] <__adrian> not sure specifically why that results in the failure though. trying to find how affinity of parameters is found
[08:44:26] <__adrian> TinoDidriksen's right
[08:44:30] <__adrian> i misread
[08:45:04] <Blondie101010> that explains it
[08:45:07] <TinoDidriksen> It is easy to misread, because usually there isn't a rule for "no match" and the last rule is indeed Numeric ... but this table has a rule for nothing.
[08:45:11] <dag> so the `in (?,?)` wont work with blobs
[08:45:20] <__adrian> so if parameters have no affinity (makes sense) then the comparison would have failed
[08:45:35] <Blondie101010> dag:  if the field was really a blob, sure
[08:46:41] <dag> im weak on sql and this timewaster crushed my sql confidence even further
[08:46:53] <Blondie101010> your query was fine

[08:50:51] <__adrian> > exactly as it was input
[08:51:14] <Blondie101010> so it could contain anything
[08:51:17] <__adrian> but the parameter, i think, is interpreted as an int
[08:51:38] <Blondie101010> well passing them unquoted in the SQL worked
[08:53:10] <__adrian> with the literals, i think prepare was able to identify the values as ints, and therefore juggled the column to int also
[08:53:38] <__adrian> but when they were parameters, that couldn't be planned for. so when the query was executed there was not type conversion.
[08:53:43] <__adrian> and therefore no match.
[08:53:59] <Blondie101010> sounds pretty good
[08:54:20] <__adrian> best i can figure. depends on a lot of stuff that doesn't seem to be in the docs  :)

[09:47:02] <biberu> your db probably has its own backup tools
[09:49:59] <TinoDidriksen> Use the DB backup tools. You can usually export a database with sorted rows, which makes for very easy to read diffs.

[09:55:21] <TinoDidriksen> The_Blode, don't even try. Use arrays or objects for such dynamic naming.
[09:55:31] <The_Blode> For example, foreach loop (days of the week) $monday_var (first iteration) $tuesday_var (second iteration)

[09:56:04] <The_Blode> I just came back to the piece today and noticing DRY issues

[09:56:41] <The_Blode> I can store the values in an array that makes sense
[09:58:07] <Blondie101010> $vars[$dayOfTheWeek]
[09:58:38] <The_Blode> So I need start and end time in my example...so possibly multidimensional for that usecase

I'm trying to find a perfect php-fpm pm.max_children setting for my site. My server; 64GB Ram and 8 Core processor. Would you recommend static, dynamic or ondemand? Thanks.
[15:11:02] <ss23> Since you already have it up and running, if I was you, I'd try different settings and see which works best :)

[15:15:32] <biberu> deksar: in addition to what ss23 said, profile it under different loads, use some tool to simulate real traffic on your test environment and try out different things there
[15:17:42] <biberu> deksar: iirc you've been asking about performance before? the best thing you can do is probably to prevent letting requests hit wordpress (or php) at all unless required, are you using any caching?
[15:18:43] <deksar> biberu: I'm using nginx-fastcgi-cache, and it performs pretty well I can say.
[15:19:01] <deksar> So at the webserver side, I'm ok - it seems, I just wanted to be "ok" on php settings as well.
[15:19:07] <deksar> dynamic, static, ondemand stuff..
[15:19:38] <biberu> deksar: are you familiar with reverse proxies?
[15:20:12] <deksar> Not really much, also I got low resources, just a single dedicated server.
[15:20:25] <biberu> if your content is mostly static / shared between many users you might be able to reuse a lot of responses and avoid invoking php at all
[15:20:47] <biberu> that would save resources if it fits your use case

[18:52:36] <Blondie101010> it sounds like an implementation bug...  did you try some example they provided or your own code?
[18:53:38] <zodd> I tried to login on the admin panel. All is not my code. I would never write code with errormsg=""
[18:54:49] <da_wunder> the point is just to see what is causing that error - and from that log I would start with searching that errorcode 102
[18:55:48] <TML> zodd: Honestly, I don't even see the reason to use open_basedir anymore. Just put your site inside a docker container.
[18:57:10] <Blondie101010> hmmmm, using docker does not make open_basedir more useless
[18:58:45] <TML> it solves the problem from another angle - there's nothing sensitive inside the docker container's filesystem that you would have to concern yourself with
[18:59:09] <TML> so for people who _think_ there's a reason for open_basedir, they can have that wubbie
[18:59:33] <Blondie101010> that's correct, but it doesn't prevent code from generating scripts to be included
[18:59:45] <Blondie101010> thinking of stuff like paule does

[19:05:08] <zodd> ok. Interesting. the admin password is hardcoded in an INI file. If you change it you get a -102 auth error. Even after a restart of nginx, fpm-php and a browser cache refresh. So it works as long as you use the default password which rightfully so ill advised against in the docs
[19:05:43] <zodd> so I wonder if I want the quality piece on my server
[19:06:59] <Blondie101010> how is it in an ini file?
[19:07:07] <Blondie101010> something sounds off
[19:07:26] <zodd> To be complete : (limited) details: https://github.com/RainLoop/rainloop-webmail/issues/2067
[19:09:11] <Blondie101010> that doesn't even show the config line in question
[19:09:24] <Blondie101010> where do you see a password in an ini file?
[19:09:48] <Blondie101010> I kind of suspect you may be changing a local service client password
[19:13:59] <zodd> Nope. It turns out the .deb file is a huge rework of the rainloop app as presented on github. The structure is quite different which does not make me happy.

[19:14:14] <zodd> an INI file seems to be handled in https://github.com/RainLoop/rainloop-webmail/blob/c519184f3e84b38f18b901dfae0af834695e6a3e/rainloop/v/0.0.0/app/libraries/RainLoop/Config/Application.php
[19:14:44] <zodd> in that code also hardcoded '12345'
[19:17:35] <Blondie101010> that's only a special case, not a hardcoded password
[19:18:16] <Blondie101010> and that case does fail if you change the default password
[19:18:58] <Blondie101010> the function shows it supports a different password, so I think you just didn't change your password the right way which is likely done in the UI
[19:19:53] <Blondie101010> nah
[19:20:14] <Blondie101010> zodd: show at least the line where that password is defined in the .ini please

[19:25:42] <Blondie101010> zodd: I think I understand what you did
[19:26:41] <Blondie101010> and the code you showed makes an exception with the 12345 password which is unencrypted
[19:27:12] <Blondie101010> zodd: correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you changed it for another unencrypted password, and the code does not allow that
[19:28:04] <da_wunder> so it looks like you need to set that password hash to your ini file, if I'm reading that code correctly
[19:28:07] <zodd> true. This is probably the cause.
[19:28:30] <zodd> thanks!
[19:28:47] <Blondie101010> https://www.rainloop.net/docs/configuration/ says the settings can be changed manually in the application.ini or in the control panel

[19:29:10] <Blondie101010> so I'd look around http://product_installation_URL/?admin
[19:30:15] <zodd> bit of an chicken-egg-problem: change the password before enabling access from the net. But then you run into the trap encrypted/unencrypted
[19:30:16] <da_wunder> that is clearly documentation issue, docs doesn't mention that at all
[19:31:05] <zodd> the docs can be improved in quality/quantity
[19:32:14] <Blondie101010> zodd:  there are various ways you could generate a proper password hash
[19:32:21] <zodd> imho the code should not check for 12345 but for the code as defined in the INI as the default and force you to change it and next store that crypted
[19:32:44] <Blondie101010> hashed, not crypted, btw
