[00:01:52] <prussian> yes
[00:01:55] <mouseghost> oh
[00:02:03] <gerikson> <<_<<
[00:02:23] <prussian> I suck at naming things. I see blue, I type prussian as user name.
[00:02:25] <mouseghost> gerikson, what are you looking at
[00:02:27] <prussian> that's all there is to the name.
[00:02:32] <gerikson> ok
[00:02:35] <mouseghost> where did you see blue?
[00:02:35] <dimadima> prussian's got the blues
[00:02:35] <prussian> lol
[00:02:39] <prussian> so true.
[00:02:54] <prussian> that's what the Cymbalta is for duh.
[00:02:55] <mouseghost> gerikson, whats up
[00:02:56] <gerikson> becasue you know... there was a kinda-sorta white power girl duo with that name
[00:03:39] <dimadima> tell your doctor if your condition persists or worsens.
[00:03:52] <mouseghost> oh
[00:04:07] <mouseghost> idk, just a chemical name
[00:04:28] <dimadima> prussian blue is a dye as far as i know
[00:04:31] <mouseghost> ye
[00:04:32] <gerikson> ok good
[00:04:38] <gerikson> sorry I brought it up
[00:05:01] <prussian> gerikson: I'm sure someone sees the name and thinks of some olde timey pre Germanic supremacy thing.
[00:05:08] <prussian> I had considered changing it, but meh.
[00:05:16] <prussian> most people ask if i'm "russian" for some weird reason.
[00:05:41] <mouseghost> oh, and re germany, i thought about it being found in gas chambers...
[00:06:03] <prussian> Hydrogen cyanide?
[00:06:06] <gerikson> yeah
[00:06:17] <mouseghost> yeah its why it is there, afaik
[00:06:44] <prussian> I swear I should just change it.
[00:06:59] <gerikson> not on our account
[00:07:21] <mouseghost> you also make cyanotypes with cyani-something iron compound, and prussian blue is what you get after you expose it to uv, iirc
[00:08:09] <dimadima> prussian sounds cool
[00:08:13] <mouseghost> (cyanotypes are the blueprints i think?)

[02:25:54] <riv> or a ball to sit on
[02:25:59] <riv> or some kind of nonstandard thing?
[02:26:44] <dimadima> skyl4rk: that's a good idea
[02:27:11] <mouseghost> btw ive arrived to a conclusion that the discrepancy in my online and real life situations, and especially the ability to talk with others and find "friends", might actually be due to some kind of unability to process some of these non-verbal information and/or give them, which would seem to fit into ASD?
[02:28:16] <riv> yes
[02:40:43] <skyl4rk> so, previously a good software toolkit was a good way to sell hardware, for money, some of which went into making sure that the software toolkit stayed on top of the needs of the hardware buyers. The only reason this burden was shouldered was because of monetary incentive, and or previously written support contracts. I don't understand how this is supposed to translate into some sort of moral
[02:40:46] <skyl4rk> imperative for open source communities.
[02:48:16] <manicennui> riv: The solution to your problems is my company's new innovative work environment: the sitting desk.
[02:49:07] <manicennui> mouseghost: Do you hang out with people who are this focused on one area of life in person?
[02:49:19] <manicennui> mouseghost: Perhaps you just need to find the right group of people.
[02:50:56] <manicennui> gerikson: I don't know what I think of that article, but I think I'd like to see it discussed.
[02:52:20] <skyl4rk> riv: I have a standing desk (electrical), can recommend
[02:52:52] <manicennui> Hasn't recent research concluded that standing desks aren't really much better than sitting?
[02:53:18] <skyl4rk> no idea
[02:54:07] <skyl4rk> some days I sit all day, some days I stand almost all day, some days I shift back and forth
[02:54:11] <mouseghost> manicennui, i dont quite follow anymore
[02:54:14] <mouseghost> everyone says that...
[02:54:23] <mouseghost> >this focused; wdym?
[02:54:30] <skyl4rk> well, did, now I've been working from home away from home where I don't have a standing desk
[02:55:26] <manicennui> mouseghost: This channel is like 75% computing and 25% geek culture. Where in real life do you spend time with such a group?
[02:55:47] <manicennui> Most of the friends I make these days are at work, where people have similar interests.
[02:57:32] <manicennui> "California lawmakers have passed a first-of-its-kind legislation that would give Amazon and other warehouse workers new power to fight speed quotas, which critics say have forced workers to skip bathroom breaks and skirt safety measures."
[02:57:39] <manicennui> Why not just enforce laws about breaks and such?
[02:58:00] <manicennui> Quotas shouldn't be illegal, but they are generally a bad way to run things.
[02:58:09] <manicennui> Just focus on treatment of employees.
[02:58:20] <manicennui> Breaks, access to bathrooms, paid for all hours worked, etc.
[02:58:26] <goodger> it's all so obvious now!
[02:59:05] <mouseghost> manicennui, nowhere tbh... i am just at school...
[02:59:07] <manicennui> Ding employers for bullshit like forcing employees to spend a bunch of their time walking across the warehouse for breaks, etc.
[03:00:36] <manicennui> mouseghost: My point is that you might find that real life isn't so different, but it is harder to find groups of people similar to the one here all in one place outside of software teams.
[03:02:05] <prussian> If it is obvious though.
[03:02:43] <prussian> Consider Amazon has to have people where they expect, I imagine, to actually ship.
[03:02:51] <prussian> I just don't buy from amazon
[03:03:16] <mouseghost> eh i dont know... its easier for me to find people who will talk with me about nothing in particular on the internet than it is irl..
[03:03:42] <manicennui> prussian: I have bad news for you: warehouse jobs suck almost universally.
[03:04:17] <manicennui> And the conditions under which most of the products are made are even worse.
[03:05:11] <prussian> Well no shit.
[03:05:27] <prussian> But I get why they run them the way they do.
[03:05:48] <prussian> Right, wrong or otherwise
[03:06:20] <manicennui> Sure, but my point is that if bathroom breaks are the problem, regulate bathroom breaks.
[03:06:48] <skyl4rk> well, one can lurk in internet communities, more difficult to do in an acceptable way in meatspace
[03:07:29] <manicennui> skyl4rk: Up your creep game.
[03:08:12] * skyl4rk plants more spore colonies
[03:09:20] <prussian> Idk man
[03:09:29] <prussian> I just don't worry about these things. Lol
[03:09:39] <prussian> But yes, people should be able to pee
[03:12:35] <manicennui> Does Amazon mind if they pee on the floor?
[03:14:47] <manicennui> I worked a warehouse job in the late 90s for a pet supply distributor. We had quotas. Some people couldn't meet them.
[03:15:20] <manicennui> It might not seem obvious, but physical ability is not the key to being faster.
[03:16:11] <manicennui> I ended up memorizing a large number of the items, so I could just walk by and grab many of the items without stopping.
[03:16:43] <manicennui> And it's not as though I had to put effort into memorizing them. After you pick an item for the 50th time you kind of remember it.
[03:18:12] <manicennui> This bill seems like it would be easy to work around.
[03:23:49] <skyl4rk> I could imagine new items pushing out the current ones before they're commited to long term memory, especially if you're already stressed about your quota
[03:24:23] <manicennui> It's not as though you have to memorize every last item.
[03:24:40] <manicennui> But certain items are going to make up a huge percentage of orders.
[03:25:44] <manicennui> The other problem that some people had is mispicking items, which means they'd have to waste time correcting the order.
[03:26:06] <manicennui> A few of us were so accurate that they stopped checking our orders and could pack them faster.
[03:27:02] <manicennui> The problem for me was that all of my performance led to a pathetic raise.
[03:27:15] <manicennui> And the warehouse had no AC.
[03:27:25] <manicennui> And various other small problems.
[03:27:30] <manicennui> So I just found another job.

[17:05:37] <gerikson> they have their own server!
[17:05:45] <gerikson> dunno why i started hanging out there
[17:06:06] <gerikson> gonna stop briging it up
[17:06:11] <gerikson> too much crazy
[17:09:00] <ngoldbaum> i think gerikson is well on his way to becoming an IRC sovcit
[17:09:07] <gerikson> god no
[17:11:07] <ngoldbaum> if you make your nick have a gold-fringed outline then rasengan can’t take away your techrights
[17:11:37] <ngoldbaum> man andrew lee needs to publish more stupid blog posts on freenode.net already
[17:12:20] <prussian> not enough outrage today?
[17:21:01] <bontaq> gotta declare some more things autonomous zones
[17:21:52] <gerikson> well it's a safe space of bargain-basement Protocols of the Elders of Zion pastiches right now
[17:33:44] <prussian> bontaq: I'm sure it's happening now. Some "Free State of something" in Texas somewhere.
[17:34:15] <prussian> I see enough people being all butt-flustered about this mandate on facebook, but I doubt anyone is really going to quit over it.
[17:37:36] <Brekkjern> There is one place where you could create your own country, but you will have to battle it out with the other sovcits over there

[17:38:30] <gerikson> SovCit Battle Royale
[17:39:21] <bontaq> oo sounds like an opportunity to form a mandate-free island prussian
[17:40:33] <bontaq> I've been starved on "people try to escape society by building a new society" since reddit island updates slowed to a crawl
[17:54:51] <goodger> I miss liberland
[17:56:50] <prussian> Brekkjern: weird...
[17:57:02] <prussian> bontaq: this.
[17:57:05] <dimadima> whats a sivcut
[17:57:08] <dimadima> sovcit
[17:57:22] <prussian> also, we need to start a truckin' convoy, 'cross the USA.
[17:57:23] <dimadima> oh google
[17:57:36] <prussian> to really show those city slickers what's what.
[17:58:48] <prussian> but ya. I miss the Sovereign citizen yt videos.
[17:58:51] <prussian> some real gems.
[17:59:07] <gerikson> have they been removed?
[17:59:23] <dimadima> they get removed? i only learned about the sovereign citizen movement last week. was just on their wikipedia page
[17:59:51] <dimadima> "The sovereign-citizen movement is a loose grouping of primarily American litigants, commentators, tax protesters, and financial-scheme promoters, who see themselves as answerable only to their particular interpretations of the common law" lol wtf
[18:00:41] <prussian> gerikson: as in new.
[18:00:44] <prussian> but idk
[18:01:04] <prussian> dimadima: yes. they are real american heroes.
[18:01:16] <prussian> don't forget a pocket constitution.
[18:01:52] <cb> hey now i enjoy the techrights inanity
[18:02:35] <dimadima> not entirely sure what techrights entails but i also think i would enjoy it
[18:03:29] <gerikson> dimadima: it's basically FSF fanatics
[18:03:42] <gerikson> but ofc FSF is not good enough most times
[18:03:52] <gerikson> f/ex/ they want RMS to denounce systemd
[18:04:12] <dimadima> lol
[18:04:16] <dimadima> he hasn't yet?
[18:04:22] <riv> why would he?
[18:04:35] <riv> he has explicitly stated that its free software
[18:04:36] <dimadima> cause it's not init scripts
[18:04:50] <riv> he doesn't care about trivialites like that
[18:04:57] <dimadima> well i was jk
[18:05:37] <dimadima> tapping into the, what i consider, irrational hatred ppl have for systemd
[18:05:50] <gerikson> it is irrational
[18:05:51] <dimadima> irrational/passionate
[18:06:05] <dimadima> and projecting it onto the quirkiness etc of RMS
[18:06:14] <gerikson> he can do no wrong
[18:06:23] <dimadima> that's surprising
[18:06:28] <gerikson> but of you have been critical of him you are stainedwith evil
[18:06:32] <gerikson> cannot be redeemed
[18:06:46] <dimadima> puritanical movements (and most movements, really) will eventually destroy any idol
[18:07:15] <dimadima> weird RMS is so pure he is still without fault
[18:09:03] <dimadima> so wait, uh where is this tech freedom chat
[18:09:14] <gerikson> irc.techrights.org
[18:09:17] <prussian> ya, stallman wouldn't denounce free software.
[18:09:31] <prussian> and he doesn't care about linux, he basically has his weird cohort manage all that for him.
[18:09:44] <dimadima> prussian: manage what?
[18:09:46] <riv> i wish i used openbsd
[18:09:48] <dimadima> thanks gerikson
[18:09:56] <riv> it seems so much better
[18:09:57] <dimadima> i wished i used anything but macos :(
[18:10:05] <dimadima> except windows obviously
[18:12:17] <dimadima> they've got something on irc.techrights.org that is about boycotting novell
[18:12:34] <gwozniak> I switched to Windows and it's been more tolerable than Linux.  That could change with Win11
[18:12:55] <dimadima> what's better?
[18:14:14] <gwozniak> I prefer using Windows, to be honest
[18:14:38] <cb> gwozniak: i bought a macbook because "lol arm" and i enjoy it more than my linux desktop now
[18:14:49] <cb> i love how the linux has had two decades and done nothihng but squandered it
[18:14:50] <dimadima> cb you mean m1?
[18:14:53] <cb> yeah
[18:14:57] <cb> it's real fuckin good
[18:15:06] <gwozniak> The M1 machine I'm using at work for a build machine is pretty stunning
[18:15:09] <cb> it's fun having a fanless laptop that can curbstomp your gaming desktop
[18:15:35] <dimadima> i suspect it's really good... macbooks are so well built imo. you go on HN and ppl complain about their thermals, etc, but all my macs have been excellent and that's all i can say at the end of the day
[18:16:13] <dimadima> i would love to use linux but i can't go back to a non-high density display
[18:16:16] <cb> i have to say using a macbook after years of thinkpads felt like a veil has been lifted
[18:16:25] <gwozniak> This M1 is competing with our 20-core Xeon Linux build machine
[18:16:37] <cb> all the shitty fucking memes i was told to believe were bullshit
[18:17:08] <dimadima> shitty memes about thinkpads or macs?
[18:17:29] <dimadima> (unfamiliar with either)
[18:17:41] <gwozniak> I'm not going to hold the Windows desktop experience on a pedestal, but I find I encounter a lot less friction than I did when I was using FreeBSD or Linux
[18:17:46] <dimadima> yeah i suspect the ppl who say thinkpad > mac haven't actually used a mac or just hate apple, which is fair imp
[18:17:49] <cb> dimadima: both
[18:18:06] <cb> https://sporks.space/2021/03/31/why-thinkpads-are-overrated-and-misunderstood/ i wrote this but the cert expired, ope
[18:18:10] <dimadima> gwozniak: windows can be solid, i'm just kind of allergic to it
[18:18:12] * cb pokes alyx
[18:18:27] <cb> just click through the warning for now. that sucks
[18:18:38] <dimadima> i resent windows for what i consider to be something like keepeing me in ignorance about computing for much longer than i should have been
[18:18:59] <dimadima> when i got my first macbook my learning skyrocketed cause of unix
[18:19:09] <gwozniak> I hated Windows for a long time because I had to work with Win95 for so long
[18:19:12] <cb> honestly i far prefer the windows dev elopment environment over unix
[18:19:26] <Brekkjern> I learned so much about computers from fucking around on our Win95
[18:19:30] <cb> having to use autoconf after using visual studio feels like getting kicked out of the garden eden
[18:19:39] <dimadima> cb: i will accept the risk and continue :)
[18:19:40] <gwozniak> Oh, I learned a lot on Win95
[18:19:53] <gwozniak> I learned a lot on Linux, too
[18:20:01] <gwozniak> Lots of it is irrelevant now
[18:20:02] <dimadima> i don't feel like i learned anything on win95-windows vista
[18:20:13] <cb> i feel like on windows i made useful shit and on posix world i have to reinvent the same shitty wheel
[18:20:14] <dimadima> it was a lot of learning how to click click click through menus
[18:20:23] <cb> i've been so so so tempted to write a modern unix haters handbook
[18:20:56] <gwozniak> cb: once this weekend is over I'm firing up the writing material again
[18:21:10] <cb> excellent
[18:21:10] <gwozniak> It's been a bit of a couple of months around here...
[18:21:19] <cb> love your writing
[18:21:28] <gwozniak> When friends and relatives die, things happen
[18:22:02] <dimadima> what are you writing about
[18:22:22] <gwozniak> The latest Sussman book, which I think is... not very good
[18:22:55] <dimadima> cb: "In reality, most people got dim, low-resolution TN panels. They aren’t even good TN panels, like the kinds you saw on older MacBook Airs." <-- this :/
[18:23:04] <gwozniak> And I've been sketching out something about a video I saw a while back called "C was always sharp" and how wrong-headed it is
[18:23:09] <cb> yessssss
[18:23:12] <cb> sussman... sus man... amogus
[18:23:44] <dimadima> the SICP sussman?
[18:23:53] <Brekkjern> SICP is so damn verbose :(
[18:24:04] <gwozniak> I've have a draft of the Sussman/Hanson book review for months, but there's something missing so I didn't publish it
[18:24:07] <Brekkjern> Takes fucking forever to get to the point
[18:24:11] <gwozniak> Yes
[18:24:14] <gwozniak> Very much so
[18:24:36] <dimadima> i'm searching what his newest book is and apprently there's something called " Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
[18:24:39] <dimadima> JavaScript Edition "
[18:24:40] <gwozniak> I think 80% of his latest book could be cut out
[18:24:53] <dimadima> is that what you're talking about gwozniak ?
[18:25:02] <gwozniak> And I'm not being facetious.  It really is useless.
[18:25:40] <gwozniak> dimadima: it's this one: https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/software-design-flexibility
[18:25:40] <buttsbot> Software Design for Flexibility | The MIT Press
[18:25:55] <dimadima> ah the one before
[18:26:10] <gwozniak> It's a very recent book.  Published earlier this year.
[18:26:33] <dimadima> yeah the javscript version of SICP is coming out 2022. i guess he wants to retire finally
[18:30:30] <prussian> I'd think an academic fp class would use like, an fp language like F#, haskell or scala or something.
[18:30:49] <prussian> apparently they made the UConn weenies do SICP and Scheme as well. well that's what the interns tell me.
[18:32:53] <Brekkjern> We do that as well...
[18:33:25] <Brekkjern> If we learned one of the languages you note, we would at least be able to use it for something afterwards..
[18:35:30] <prussian> translate your l33t schemer schemes to guix.
[18:35:32] <prussian> simple.
[18:36:01] <prussian> or maybe fix HackerNews so I don't see Dang talk about pagination or whatever coming soon.

[19:39:31] <manicennui> I think I'm one of the few people who likes Memento, Insomnia, and Interstellar more than his Batman movies and Inception.
[19:40:45] <manicennui> I remember The Prestige being interesting, but I can't remember whether I liked it.
[19:40:45] <manicennui> And Dunkirk was certainly well made, but I didn't need more WW2 propaganda.
[19:40:45] <manicennui> That being said I do want to see a movie about the creation of the bomb.
[19:42:50] <ngoldbaum> tenet was fine although the plot makes no sense if you stop and think for 30 seconds
[19:42:56] <ngoldbaum> but i guess that’s a nolan movie
[19:43:55] <manicennui> I felt the same way about Inception.
[19:44:08] <manicennui> But I should probably watch it again.
[19:47:01] <manicennui> I appreciate Nolan because he doesn't make the standard Hollywood schlock.

[20:29:37] <manicennui> "He has backed so-called conversion therapy for gay people and carried out exorcisms."
[20:29:40] <manicennui> Okay, that fucking blows.
[20:30:56] <gerikson> I think she fucking blows ;)
[20:31:52] <gerikson> also she is a divorcee!!!
[20:32:00] <gerikson> scandalous!

[20:32:42] <manicennui> Sorry, different topic.

[20:33:10] <manicennui> Not only weird, but idiotic; they give counsel couples.
[20:33:16] <manicennui> s/give//
[20:33:32] <gerikson> there's no biblical justification for it
[20:33:51] <manicennui> I worked with a guy whose wife wanted to get married in a specific church back home, so they lied to the priest about living together, having sex, etc.
[20:33:52] <gerikson> I really think it does more harm than good but I was raised Lutheran

[20:57:06] <gwozniak> Must be because of that nasty word, "public"
[20:57:36] <goodger> public implies it might extend to blacks and queers
[20:58:43] <prussian> ya, I thought it was funny. THE FINAL COVID VARIANT: COMMUNISM. It's like those extreme bumper sticker'd F-250s with the dixie battle flags and all
[20:58:45] <prussian> kind of thing.
[20:58:51] <gerikson> in the beginning of hte pandemic these assholes were hoarding masks and hand sanitizer
[20:58:58] <gwozniak> Of course
[20:59:02] <prussian> I suppose that's the "chad" meme in a nut shell
[20:59:11] <prussian> stupidity taken to the nth level of comedy
[20:59:49] <prussian> don't forget toilet paper
[21:00:16] <dimadima> that techrights channel is all just news links if ppl wanted to talk they would have to compete with the links
[21:00:35] <gwozniak> And I'm sure if there was a vaccine, but it wasn't demonstrated to be effective, they would be yelling for it
[21:02:21] <prussian> I know people who said they would take Sputnik V, because, I guess it is Russian.
[21:02:28] <manicennui> I wonder whether TP companies had a good 2020.
[21:02:28] <prussian> I don't see how that changes anything.
[21:02:47] <prussian> I imagine they saw a good quarter and then it sort of normalized.

[21:07:27] <prussian> I think the big headlines today was the Apple/Epic Games Ruling, no?
[21:07:49] <manicennui> I don't really follow the news unless it ends up on the front page of reddit.
[21:08:27] <manicennui> I'm sure Apple will appeal.
[21:08:38] <manicennui> I have mixed feelings about it.
[21:08:58] <manicennui> I agree generally, but I also think that fraud will increase significantly.
[21:09:17] <manicennui> I know preventing fraud is only a small part of why Apple requires apps to use their payment service.
[21:10:08] <manicennui> I think the thing geeks completely miss with discussions about Apple's policies is that the average person actually benefits from them.
[21:10:41] <manicennui> Even if they are mostly designed to benefit Apple.
[21:10:44] <prussian> such is life
[21:11:40] <manicennui> Managing Windows machines during the late 90s and early 2000s was a fucking nightmare.
[21:11:46] <manicennui> Users will click anything.
[21:12:22] <manicennui> I had family members who expected me to take care of all of their malware/virus problems when I came over.
[21:12:28] <manicennui> Which often meant a reinstall.
[21:13:42] <manicennui> You'd think people would be more careful in a corporate setting, but nope.
[21:13:54] <prussian> nah
[21:13:54] <manicennui> I've even seen software engineers click shit.
[21:13:57] <prussian> not my computer

[21:14:50] <prussian> and I go, uh, ok cool
[21:14:58] <prussian> it's a 2 way problem.
[21:15:19] <prussian> my favorite is how the phish training emails all have some easy to filter header too, so all of them go straight to spam.
[21:16:36] <skyl4rk> hm, had one of those, went to the domain on a private computer to check, and it was the company front page for phish resistance and evaluation traing etc
[21:17:12] <prussian> ya

[22:19:28] <mouseghost> manicennui, i wonder how viable itd be to provide such thing for public buses
[22:21:30] <mouseghost> https://rj.metropoliaztm.pl/media/uploads/2021/tychytrolejbusy-trasy-4-05-2021-most-gora-roweckiego_internet-rgb.png
[22:21:30] <mouseghost> nvm
[22:21:34] <mouseghost> it doesnt look that nice
[22:22:14] <gwozniak> manicennui: yeah, I have a feeling we're about to see an uptick in fraud on the app store as well
[22:22:55] <mouseghost> https://rj.metropoliaztm.pl/media/uploads/2021/tramwaje_01.09.2021popr.png
[22:22:55] <mouseghost> hm
[22:23:30] <cb> manicennui: agreed tbh
[22:23:59] <cb> i think gruber is a bit of a tool but he's on the money with https://daringfireball.net/2021/08/implications_of_third-party_payment_processing_for_iap
[22:23:59] <buttsbot> Daring Fireball: Let’s Consider Some of the Implications of Third-Party Payment Processing for In-App Purchasing on iOS and Android
[22:24:15] <cb> if apple could guarantee the same things for third party IAPs, it's all fine

[22:25:28] <mouseghost> i love those colors aaaah
[22:33:18] <manicennui> mouseghost: We have bus maps too, but they are per route.
[22:33:30] <manicennui> There are too many buses to have them all on one map.
[22:33:33] <mouseghost> doesnt that kinda beat the point, though...
[22:33:34] <mouseghost> .w.
[22:34:59] <manicennui> Actually it looks like you can get them all on one map: https://www.transitchicago.com/assets/1/6/ctamap_SystemMap.pdf
[22:35:05] <manicennui> mouseghost: No, because almost no one looks them up that way.
[22:35:16] <manicennui> Google Maps and other services know all about our public transportation.
[22:35:34] <manicennui> I don't know why in the world you'd use a CTA map at this point.
[22:36:01] <mouseghost> well, its not like that everywhere
[22:36:30] <manicennui> But Chicago has a very solid grid, and the bus you want usually follows one street for the most part, so it isn't hard to figure out which route you are interested in.
[22:36:45] <manicennui> mouseghost: Sure, but I'm referring to here.
[22:36:53] <mouseghost> cool, cool
[22:36:58] <manicennui> And it is the case for all large American cities with decent public transportation.
[22:37:03] <manicennui> Which is like 5 cities.
[22:37:27] <mouseghost> lol
[22:38:23] <manicennui> You really need a car in most other cities.
[22:39:33] <manicennui> Might be able to use public transportation for very specific trips in those cities, but you can't generally get everywhere you need to go, and public transportation in general has a stigma outside of the top cities.
[22:40:15] <mouseghost> i see
[22:40:20] <mouseghost> here its normal to use buses etc
[22:40:21] <mouseghost> and trains
[22:40:30] <mouseghost> though i still would prefer to have a car
[22:41:17] <manicennui> Here it is normal, but a lot of people drive unnecessarily, especially suburbanites who come to the city.
[22:41:48] <mouseghost> sometimes public transport is pain in the ass, so..
[22:42:43] <manicennui> Sure. I use cabs or ride sharing from time to time, and there are certain trips where I wouldn't mind having a car, but having a car here is a pain in the ass, traffic is terrible, and there is nowhere near enough space to park/store a car for everyone.
[22:43:14] <mouseghost> ahm .w.
[22:43:17] <mouseghost> cabs r expensive
[22:43:29] <manicennui> High population density and heavy car usage don't work.
[22:43:57] <manicennui> Eh, cabs aren't that bad here.
[22:44:11] <manicennui> And the thing to realize is that most of us aren't traveling like 20 miles in a cab.
[22:44:26] <manicennui> People tend to do things in their neighborhoods and slightly outside of their neighborhood.
[22:45:10] <manicennui> Before the pandemic I could Uber from downtown where I worked to where I live for under $20.
[22:45:25] <manicennui> Which is not how I would commute every day, but there were days when I would do it.
[22:46:01] <manicennui> Usually when it is super cold outside.
[22:46:32] <manicennui> But I can walk to most things I need to do.
[22:54:27] <manicennui> https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2021/sep/10/denmark-lifts-all-covid-restrictions-as-vaccinations-top-80-per-cent
[22:54:27] <buttsbot> Denmark lifts all Covid restrictions as vaccinations top 80% | Denmark | The Guardian
[22:54:33] <manicennui> Scandinavian country declares it no longer considers coronavirus a ‘socially critical’ disease
[22:54:44] <manicennui> So how long until there is a huge spike in Denmark?
[23:05:33] <Brekkjern> If they have it like us, then the infection numbers are kinda irrelevant.
[23:05:40] <manicennui> My coworkers are obsessed with running everything in Docker, which I get to some extent, but they have constant problems keeping it working.
[23:05:49] <manicennui> Meanwhile I don't have any issues and don't use their docker crap.
[23:06:04] <manicennui> Brekkjern: How are they irrelevant?
[23:06:16] <Brekkjern> The lockdowns were to flatten the curve here so the hospitals could cope. Now that people are vaccinated, very few end up hospitalized.
[23:06:29] <manicennui> Ah.
[23:06:58] <Brekkjern> We might at some point have to tighten down again of course
[23:07:09] <Brekkjern> But not with the current strains and vaccination status
[23:07:26] <manicennui> I'm wondering whether the deaths here will have an impact on elections in the future.
[23:07:40] <manicennui> In areas where the elections were close, it's possible that more Republicans have died.
[23:07:59] <manicennui> And old people in general.
[23:08:20] <Brekkjern> I doubt it would have created a very significant impact, but it would have been interesting to see how much
[23:08:32] <manicennui> Yeah.
[23:13:29] <indigo> manicennui: tbf, docker makes it very easy for me to self-host shit
[23:14:03] <indigo> I don't need to figure out how to install and configure whatever node flavor-of-the-week runtime is needed, I can just "docker run"
[23:14:51] *** Joins: sudoforge (~sudoforge@wireguard/tunneler/sudoforge)
[23:15:01] <manicennui> Sure, I get that, but we also have prebuild VM images for our big legacy app, and none of the docker files people have created for the other apps are reliable.
[23:15:34] <indigo> Ah, well.. if I had prebuilt VM images I'd use that instead :) don't swim against the stream, ya know
[23:15:37] <manicennui> I understand why it is a better way to do things.
[23:15:53] <indigo> It's only better if it works
[23:15:57] <manicennui> Although I don't think it has any real advantages of VM images.
[23:16:02] <manicennui> s/of/over/
[23:16:18] <Brekkjern> Docker makes it much easier to actually deploy shit than deploying from a VM image though
[23:16:22] <manicennui> Amusingly, most of the problems are with our frontends.
[23:16:24] <manicennui> Which I avoid.
[23:16:40] <manicennui> Brekkjern: We use neither (although technically things are running on vmware).
[23:16:41] <Brekkjern> Mostly because running VM images requires a full on hypervisor that isn't quite as polished
[23:16:51] <manicennui> We have terraform and chef scripts that build production nodes.
[23:17:12] <Brekkjern> I really meant at home tbh
[23:17:19] <manicennui> Brekkjern: You are almost certainly running your docker images in a VM in production.
[23:17:36] <Brekkjern> When you have a vmware cluster, then spinning up an OVF or whatever it's called is trivial
[23:17:45] <Brekkjern> It's not trivial to do the same in a tiny homelab
[23:17:51] <manicennui> I don't have a homelab anymore.
[23:18:02] <manicennui> And at work I use an EC2 instance for development.
[23:18:10] <manicennui> And run one or two apps locally bare metal.
[23:21:34] <indigo> Yeah, a cloud environment seems to be the way to go these days
[23:21:52] <indigo> At my last job we had a local environment running through docker-compose on macOS
[23:22:10] <indigo> Turned my macbook into a glob of molten metal
[23:22:14] <Brekkjern> That's pretty much the point I'm making too. If you have the opportunity to outsource the running of the hypervisor, then it's trivial to set up a VM
[23:22:28] <Brekkjern> If you don't have that luxury, running docker on a random linux machine is easier
[23:22:31] <manicennui> We also have too many things at this point which rely on AWS services.
[23:22:45] <manicennui> People have tried to get them working with localstack, but it is a pain in the ass, and rarely works well.
[23:23:26] <manicennui> Brekkjern: We all use Macs, so you aren't getting around the VM overhead.
[23:24:03] <manicennui> My preferred setup at this point is working on a Mac, but sshing to Linux machines for actual work.
[23:25:02] <manicennui> Only 5.5k subscribes to /r/weeb. Surprising.
[23:25:27] <indigo> manicennui: Yeah, localstack was a major PITA
[23:25:39] <manicennui> /r/weebootales has 293k subscribers.
[23:33:12] <indigo> Also it's not proper microservices if you need all the services running to use your dev environment
[23:33:36] <manicennui> No True Microservice
[23:33:45] <manicennui> We don't do microservices really.
[23:34:16] <manicennui> Although we have this thing which you could say is a microservice orchestrator, and is needed by some parts of our system, and does run in AWS.
[23:34:57] <manicennui> The thing is, everyone pushes the "we only need contract testing" thing, but most people can't write loosely coupled, highly coherent services.
[23:35:13] <manicennui> So shit never works right until we do end-to-end testing.
[23:36:35] <manicennui> Where do all of the weebs hang out these days?
[23:40:26] <bontaq> tiktok
[23:40:53] <manicennui> I meant more like discussions.
[23:41:05] <manicennui> I'm guessing discord.
[23:42:52] <bontaq> yeah action button discord has a decently active anime room, tends a little older so it's more discussion-oriented
