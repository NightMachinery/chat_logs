[23:28:44] <sm> it sure does.. there's something about the environment and snake that seems right, and distinctive
[23:29:39] <sm> though I would find the constant eating of people a little disturbing :)
[23:30:14] <sm> building haskell things on android, good for mobile games ?
[23:30:14] <sm> https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/rqn71v/recipe_to_compile_haskell_on_termux_for_aarch64
[23:31:37] <sm> also nice today: https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/rqmwyp/the_source_code_of_defect_process/
[23:32:46] <f-a> super analysis
[23:33:47] <sm> lol "snek cam"
[23:34:18] <sm> also 3d snaking, it can go over/under itself. The update snake has been needing all these years!
[23:36:02] <f-a> sm: have you made a caverunner annoucnement post on reddit/etc.?
[23:36:17] <f-a> it would be a great way to pull people here!
[23:36:31] <sm> not yet f-a, I need to finish off 1.0 and do that
[23:36:46] <f-a> good
[23:37:10] <f-a> I am writing xmas letters
[23:37:11] <ManofLetters[m]> good
[23:37:51] <sm> "just finish it off" sm
[23:37:52] <sm> f-a++
[23:38:21] <ManofLetters[m]> sm: no pressure, no pressure at all
[23:38:28] <f-a> using a dip pen is not easy…
[23:38:47] <sm> you asked if you could write me here, of course but I think I still need to reply to the first one you sent!
[23:39:09] <f-a> do not feel forced replying!
[23:39:12] * sm tries to clear some space for game dev
[23:39:29] <f-a> I enjoy writing as much if not more receiving
[23:39:31] <f-a> *but*
[23:39:36] <f-a> I think I have your old address
[23:43:51] <f-a> (if someone wants to receive a postcard from Milan, feel free to ask)
[23:44:25] <f-a> tho covid + xmas time means it will be slower than a snail
[23:44:46] <sm> we've had some mail from Ireland that seemed to move pretty quickly
[23:45:01] <sm> easier to move letters than people, for sure
[23:45:12] <f-a> hehe
[23:45:38] <sm> in other news I am crafting a new emacs config for 2022. I am expecting massive productivity gains.
[23:47:36] <f-a> ah, good! do you dabble in elisp then?
[23:48:04] <f-a> there are some choices (dynamic scope) that baffles me but 10⁷ emacs usercs cannot be wrong
[23:48:08] <sm> as little as possible, but I have to debug it fairly often
[23:49:11] <f-a> “as little as possible” doesn’t sound like a positive review xd
[23:49:19] <sm> yes, usually the wealth of contributors helps. Just redoing emacs config though (not even making software), I have been reminded of how we haskellers take declarative code and disciplined state management for granted. It has been a shock!
[23:50:08] <f-a> yeah
[23:50:14] <f-a> it is really painful out there
[23:50:28] <sm> move this package load before or after that seemingly unrelated line ? makes things work or break!
[23:53:28] <f-a> oooooooooooooooooouch
[23:53:37] <sm> I'm not disrespecting elisp/emacs at all, it is a fantastic achievement for its time and even today, but it is a shock
[23:54:50] <f-a> child of his time
