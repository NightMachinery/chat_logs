[12:25:12] <belcher> both of those

[12:31:59] <belcher> new bitcoin addresses use bech32, and storing private keys is now universally done with seed phrases
[12:32:13] <cvmn> anyways, 58.  fine.  58 * 51 = 2958 bits.  this unfair to compare to the seed phrase which you pasted earlier which has only about 132 bits.
[12:32:32] <belcher> not all those bits contribute to the entropy, many are checksum bits or version bits
[12:32:42] <belcher> iirc that privkey format i linked has 256bits
[12:32:52] <cvmn> how much entropy is in 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF?
[12:33:13] <belcher> i think it has 128 bits of entropy (half of 258 bits of its size)
[12:33:41] <belcher> do note that its possible to use seed phrases made of 24 words instead of 12, which has ~256 bits
[12:33:50] <Keele> base58 is not 58 bits of entropy per character
[12:33:51] <cvmn> yeah.
[12:33:59] <cvmn> Keele: yeah that's my mistake.
[12:34:59] <cvmn> log2(58) * 51 = 298.7570307515062
[12:38:14] <cvmn> belcher: 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76Mz gives about 132 entropy bits.
[12:40:49] <cvmn> but has much less redundancy.  i.e. if a letter is erased, it is forgotten forever and we need to bruteforce it
[12:41:07] <belcher> yep

[20:16:51] <Kinars> hey people, i was having a discussion with a friend and basically talking about who controls the bitcoin network and his point was that the miners control the network and my point was that they dont and that everyone who uses bitcoin has to come to a consensus
[20:17:56] <earnestly> Sure
[20:18:05] <Kinars> So who is right>?
[20:18:11] <DeanGuss> "devs propose, miners activate, users override"
[20:18:14] <earnestly> You of course
[20:18:32] <earnestly> It's somewhat ridiculous to still believe the former
[20:20:37] <earnestly> I assume they got their opinion secondhand from someone else back in 2012 and just never did the research, investigation, etc.
[20:20:41] *** Quits: polve (~polve@user/polve) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[20:20:51] <DeanGuss> specifically it's the economic users who have final say, the people taking coin for products/services like vendors and exchanges
[20:20:56] <earnestly> That's usually the case with this sorts of talking points
[20:21:04] <Kinars> i sent them this FAQ https://bitcoin.org/en/faq#who-controls-the-bitcoin-network and got this reply "ur answer is right there in what u just sent me
[20:21:04] <Kinars> [14:59]
[20:21:04] <Kinars> While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users."
[20:22:19] <earnestly> Kinars: Have you considered that there is no possibility that they would change their mind, especially not with evidence?
[20:22:32] <earnestly> And that trying to change their mind isn't worth it
[20:24:08] *** grettke-away is now known as grettke
[20:24:44] <Kinars> yeah he is invested in bitcoin and is good with tech topics so mabye admitting he is wrong was too much
[20:25:40] <Kinars> while googling this subject the bitcoin faq was the only really good source i found
[20:26:12] *** Joins: polve (~polve@user/polve)
[20:27:42] <earnestly> He is wrong, and basic research would find counter examples, but because this is the case it should be an indication that they've simply got strong opinions that aren't going to change
[20:28:07] <earnestly> Not everyone has to be convinced, or corrected.  They can remain wrong
[20:28:26] <earnestly> (They're certainly not the people one wants to encourge or associate with)
[20:28:54] <earnestly> Kinars: But if you're their friend, avoid discussions like this and stick to what matters more
[20:29:23] <ghost43> miners and users are both very important. both are needed. if there was a huge disagreement about forking some rules, and all miners started mining a user-invalid chain, so there would be "two" chains, one with all users and one with all miners, then neither chain would have ~any value. so it is clearly false that miners alone decide. user and miners are both important. now the weights are a more interesting question. clearly if *some* miners
[20:29:24] <ghost43> or users reneged to the other side of the splits, those chains would start to have some value.
[20:29:36] <Kinars> He is convinced that bitcoin will fail because miners will never let bitcoin become a proof of stake coin
[20:29:38] <earnestly> (Or find humour in it, make jokes)
[20:29:43] <earnestly> That's okay
[20:30:20] <ghost43> lol
[20:30:26] <earnestly> Kinars: (Fwiw, a simple analogy.  PoW = gold, PoS = fiat)
[20:30:50] <earnestly> So if you want all the problems that come with fiat, use PoS
[20:33:26] <ghost43> Kinars: just link them to https://endthefud.org/
[20:33:51] <bugs_> nice :-)
[20:34:33] <Kinars> yeah earnestly i will take your advice and avoid crypto chats with said friend, thanks for the comprehensive answers and advice i learned a bit today haha, i will remember that earnestly from my basic understanding i never researched pos as much as i have for pow coins, staking seems to create value out of nothing where pow is more related to the cost of "producing" each block
