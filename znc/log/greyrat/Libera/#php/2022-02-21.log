[00:00:54] <__adrian> if you're building with stuff oyu have already, then just go bench it yourself
[00:01:08] <__adrian> you're not answering the one question i actually asked  ;)
[00:01:09] <void09> that was 3970x * threadripper
[00:01:45] <void09> well I saw that phpbench chart where the new intel gen rules, but then I realised.. phpbench must be doing single thread stuff, and it's known intel took the lead again with 12th gen
[00:02:07] <void09> Yeah it's no big deal to buy another motherboard/cpu if gains are significant
[00:02:18] <__adrian> and apologies, but to clarify: i was posing questions you might ask of yourself (that might help you decide), but hardware is still off-topic here so didn't mean to provoke a conversation.
[00:02:49] <void09> what would be a suitable place for such a topic ? homelab/selfhosting reddit?
[00:04:50] <__adrian> probably. if you want hear more from me, i have #php-enspired. and less of the software aspect, but there are smart folks on #hardware

[11:50:17] <mishehu> I'm working with php 7.4.27 and pdo pgsql.  when I do a SELECT query and one of hte columns is of type character(16), I get back a string that is always 16 characters long, though the entry is actually only 5 chars long.  Is this typical behavior?  (I don't recall it being so.)

[11:52:58] <Naktibalda> that's the typical behaviout of CHAR type
[11:53:05] <Naktibalda> behaviour
[11:54:13] <mishehu> odd, it did not used to do that in an earlier 7.4 version.  though i did go from pgsql version 11.1 to 14.1.
[11:55:36] <Naktibalda> I think that PDO doesn't do any trimming, it happens in postgres.
[11:56:58] <Naktibalda> Values of type character are physically padded with spaces to the specified width n, and are stored and displayed that way.
[11:57:38] <mishehu> yeah stored in teh db as always n chars for each row.  I did used to get the trimmed results.  I'll have to manually trim now.
[11:58:47] <Naktibalda> are you sure that it wasn't a varchar before?
[11:59:24] <Naktibalda> haven't you migrated to postgres yesterday?
[12:00:25] <mishehu> Naktibalda: negative, it was not even of character varying type even 1 1/2 years ago, just checked a dump.
[12:00:51] <mishehu> Naktibalda: the discussion yesterday was about a different database that is still in mysql at the current time.
[12:01:13] <Naktibalda> what's the reason to make it fixed length if you are storing shorter values and don't care about padding?
[12:03:23] <Naktibalda> according to documentation fixed length character type has not advantages in postgres.
[12:04:22] <mishehu> Naktibalda: your guess is as good as mine.  this database predates my employment at the company, and it's not that big of a deal.  and advantages are in the eye of the beholder.  there may be a reason, or it may be that the person intended it to be character varying(16).  *shrug*
[12:04:50] <mishehu> what is weird is the two separate behaviors I am getting from the php side.  but at least this is readily fixed with little effort.

[12:52:36] <TinoDidriksen> How do you even manage to get a deadlock? That almost never happens with InnoDB and transactions.
[12:52:44] *** Joins: mIk3_08 (~Thunderbi@user/mik3-08/x-2852566)
[12:53:00] <TinoDidriksen> But ask #mysql for such strategies.
[12:53:02] <Naktibalda> deadlocks only happen using Innodb and transactions :)
[12:54:49] <Naktibalda> Make sure that your transaction are short lived and avoid updating many different tables in the same transaction. Easier said than done.
[12:54:56] <AllenJB> Other than improving query performance or minimizing the work done in transactions, to minimize lock time, there's not a lot you can do other than retry the query later. You may want to look at implementing a message queue based system to facilitate that

[13:18:16] <Naktibalda> freeman_h: it doesn't require multiple applications, deadlock is caused by different processes locking rows in different order.

[13:48:22] <TinoDidriksen> I don't think that's what 7bit means. If you just wanted to check for 7 bit clean, that's what ASCII is for.
[13:49:14] <hans> so.. "7bit" does not mean "only use the first 7 bits" ?
[13:49:51] <Naktibalda> 7bit should mean 7bit bytes, doesn't it?
[13:51:22] <hans> hmm, found an interesting definition on https://galprop.stanford.edu/bugs/docs/en/html/api/Bugzilla/Util.html
[13:51:30] <hans> >Returns true is the string contains only 7-bit characters (ASCII 32 through 126, ASCII 10 (LineFeed) and ASCII 13 (Carrage Return).
[13:51:55] <hans> even if that definition is correct, php's current mb_check_encoding is bugged by validating chr(255)
[13:53:47] <hans> but it also means my is_7bit_clean function should be changed to ($o >= 32 && $o <=126) || $o === 10 || $o === 13
[13:54:29] <TinoDidriksen> Nevermind me, PHP's 7bit does indeed just check 7 bits: https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/ext/mbstring/libmbfl/filters/mbfilter_7bit.c#L78
[13:56:15] <hans> im not convinced but maybe
[13:57:13] <TinoDidriksen> You are right that telling it to use the 8bit check functions is incorrect.
[13:59:04] <TinoDidriksen> But it looks like 7bit is practically worthless. It can't detect encoding either.

[16:53:54] <__adrian> ^
[16:54:02] <freeman_h> Naktibalda, api 1 has a job which runs to so some post or get request to api 2
[16:54:43] <Naktibalda> make it a job on api 2 too
[16:54:51] <freeman_h> the background task timeouts on api 1 end. in the apache error log getting alot of this "(70007)The timeout specified has expired"
[16:55:48] <__adrian> if {anything} takes that long, you tell the user that "the data will  be ready later" and then fetch it out-of-band, e.g., in a job queue. they can look at a "results" page to see it once it's ready.

[16:56:29] <AllenJB> You can use polling of a job status endpoint or a callback URL to know when the task is done
[16:56:50] <AllenJB> If the timeout is in the Apache logs, it's probably Apache settings affecting it, not PHP settings.
[16:56:56] <__adrian> client requests data → your Api says "202 Accepted; ok i'll do that" → client request is done.
[16:57:16] <AllenJB> Also consider what happens if Apache is restarted (config changes, SSL cert updates) or the server is rebooted.
[16:57:37] <__adrian> in your job queue, get the data from the remote Api. store the result when it's done.
[16:58:03] <__adrian> client requests results. if the job is done, show results; if not, reply "not yet, check again later."

[19:25:51] <Naktibalda> does php-fpm reset it to php-fpm user?
[19:27:19] <lxwulf> also the problem is not solved yet... now i got => https://paste.ofcode.org/QUMyZ57rLPNaHV4VWpgxDA
[19:27:51] <lxwulf> no it resets to root:root and when i changed it to www-data:www-data this error goes away
[19:28:03] <lxwulf> but as said the new one came up
[19:28:29] <da_wunder> so has that nginx user permissions to read those php files?
[19:33:03] <lxwulf> the root folder is /var/www/cloudwulf which belongs to www-data (recursive) modus is 751 and inside folder everything has modus 660
