[16:24:03] <TRS> Morning......Hope everyone is well today. Hello from Canada
[16:26:04] <TRS> I'm trying to output the results of my command into a file  but I woudl like the results to be prepented with the current date [yy-mm-dd] - [result_value] on each line of the file
[16:26:08] <TRS> this is the command
[16:26:10] <TRS> awk 'NF > 1 && $(NF-1) ~ /^\(hitcnt=[0-9]+\)$/{ split($(NF-1), a, /=/); sum += a[2] } END { print sum }' *.${now}.txt >> ~/blhits_reporting_results.txt
[16:26:36] <TRS> maybe the ts command?
[16:26:53] <TRS> just not sure of how to properly to place the ts command into the syntax
[16:27:49] <TRS> awk 'NF > 1 && $(NF-1) ~ /^\(hitcnt=[0-9]+\)$/{ split($(NF-1), a, /=/); sum += a[2] } END { print sum }' *.${now}.txt >> ~/blhits_reporting_results.txt << echo ts "/n"

[18:19:28] <TRS> Hey guys, just a random question. Does anyonehave a link you can share that shows an example of a simple error capture?  I'd like to learn how to script and capture errors and output my own error message. For example oif I try to cat a file and the files doesn't exists I want to say echo out my own custom message. 
[18:21:26] <e36freak> ... in awk? how are you "catting" the file? system()? a pipe?
[18:21:29] <nmz> that depends entirely on the command
[18:21:48] <TRS> no awk, it''s just a bash question
[18:21:53] <emanuele6> #bash
[18:21:56] <TRS> cat file.txt
[18:22:00] <TRS> for example
[18:22:09] <e36freak> ^
[18:22:10] <e36freak> #bash
[18:22:12] <TRS> ok
[18:22:17] <TRS> I'll go there
[18:22:20] <nmz> beware of the dicks there
[18:22:20] <TRS> sorry
[18:24:34] <e36freak> i mean all you may know is if cat was successful or not, the error status isn't fine grained enough to give you a different exit code for every possible error
[18:24:52] <e36freak> then you're stuck trying to capture stderr and parse it to figure it out, and the message is gonna change based on locale
[18:24:58] <e36freak> seems like kinda a silly thing to do tbh, why?
