[00:07:51] <Cl0udNinja> the idea of everyone being on a single sleep schedule is absolutely stupid. from an evolutionary standpoint it makes sense for people to be awake at night while others sleep, and opposite. watchers/guards/protectors at night ensured that the community had no problems, and had protection during the day from those awake. the only reason everyone is forced on the same sleep schedule is for work

[16:11:02] <xe0n> yeah that isn't a good habbit...you'll end up pissing people off (and could break something). its probably the way you're bringing it up that gets you shut down initially.

[18:57:59] <Kiernian> wtf, this 8 port ubiquiti switch is smoking crack
[18:58:31] <Kiernian> keeps getting itself shut off due to STP, which is absolutely, utterly impossible. THere's one tower with no wireless anything plugged into it, and a wireless AP, and that's IT
[18:58:43] <signofzeta> Kiernian: is the firmware up to date?
[18:59:04] <catbeard> replace stone temple pilots with rage against the machine
[18:59:14] <Kiernian> it's not prompting for an update, so I assume so
[18:59:39] <Kiernian> automatic upgrades are enabled
[19:00:01] <signofzeta> That is weird.  Do you have a good cable?  What's plugged into the other side?
[19:00:01] <sd> 14<K​illnine> argh, i hate that M.2 drives dont come with the screw to install them (Samsung 970 evo)
[19:00:28] <signofzeta> My only gripe with my UniFi switches are that a few of my ports are permanently stuck in 10/100 mode.  But, knowing me, there's probably just dust in there or something.  I use those ports for my printers.
[19:00:43] <Kiernian> hrm. cable might be a little long, but it goes right into the ubiquiti 48 port that's one floor down
[19:01:21] <Kiernian> interference from, like, a power cord couldn't trip spanning tree, could it?
[19:01:43] <signofzeta> doubtful
[19:01:47] <signofzeta> Anything logged on the other side?
[19:01:59] <signofzeta> Did you set STP priorities in the Network App, or leave everything at the default 32768?
[19:02:05] <Kiernian> default
[19:02:33] <Kiernian> and I'll have to dig through the logs later. It's nearly bed time for me, but I can easily fish them up when I'm rested.
[19:02:56] <signofzeta> try making the switch closest to the router a higher priority.  with my setup, my first switch is 4096, my other switches are 8192, etc.
[19:03:09] <signofzeta> I'm no STP expert, but that might help.  worst case, it'll do nothing.
[19:03:10] <Kiernian> hrm okay. good idea.
[19:03:26] <catbeard> maybe switch to PVST/MST
[19:03:41] <Oliber> @K​illnine that's because different boards have different screw styles, it's stupid
[19:03:43] <catbeard> guard yer BPDUs and root ports
[19:05:20] <Kiernian> lol. the unifi UI is so screwy on some things. Hitting "clients" on this switch shows 14 LAN connected devices, which is impossible as only 3 ports are in use.
[19:05:44] <signofzeta> Ubiquiti UniFi lets you pick STP, RSTP, or nothing.  I don't think PVST/MST are options.
[19:06:02] <catbeard> sux
[19:06:08] <Kiernian> yeah, it's stp or rstp...or off, which is what it is right now since I know it's not a spanning tree problem

[22:36:03] <signofzeta> the vaccine never prevented you from catching COVID.  the flu vaccine doesn't stop you from getting the flu.  it just gives your immune system a headstart on ass-kicking.

[23:23:12] <shakygator> how do you guys use terraform in a team env? do you have a common utility box the team uses? How do you share states?
[23:23:47] <Cl0udNinja> shakygator, theres multiple ways to share states, and you only need the tf and state files, nothing else needed so no util box needed
[23:24:03] <shakygator> so are you committing them to source control?
[23:24:13] <Cl0udNinja> we store ours on an nfs share
[23:24:23] <shakygator> so still common storage
[23:24:32] <Cl0udNinja> committing them isnt a good idea iirc, but theres plenty of ways to share them
[23:33:21] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> We have a storage account as part of the env buildup that holds the state file.

[23:34:35] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Commiting it to a repo generally not considered best practice because it's harder to control permissions. The state file is pretty sensitive.
