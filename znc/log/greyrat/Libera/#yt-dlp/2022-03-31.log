[23:35:24] <jensen>  can I prevent it from not downloading the video at least?
[23:35:47] <jensen> whoops, ignore above ^
[23:35:49] <jensen> if i want to --embed-metadata to all my existing files downloaded, will yt-dlp will attempt to download the video again, fail, and embed metadata, right? I have old videos that were downloaded with an old output template, i suppose yt-dlp will simply download the same video with current output template? can I prevent it from not downloading the video at least?
[23:35:53] <jensen> even if the same output template was used, Youtube re-encodes using their videos over time and this could potentially change the extension so the video would be re-downloaded
