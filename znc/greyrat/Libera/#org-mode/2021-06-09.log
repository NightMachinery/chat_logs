[17:08:36] <zebrag> So, for years I've been losing and duplicating every bits of notes that I was taking, consequently ending up asking google again and again for everything.
[17:10:10] <zebrag> It really seems Zettelkasten method is minimal in the concern of taking notes.
[17:11:16] <zebrag> But I don't think a workflow can work if the community is not large enough, or if there are other reasons why the workflow is resilient.
[17:12:19] <zebrag> Like being made of real wood and real cardboard.
[17:13:50] <zebrag> Org-mode works for writing init.el/org file, and for an enhanced agenda.
[17:14:29] <zebrag> I think that if you want to use it for anything else, you'll end up in endless procrastination.
[17:14:59] <zebrag> So I might be better off losing every bits of notes I'm taking.
[17:15:25] <zebrag> And giving up on org-mode.
[17:17:09] <zebrag> Altogether.
[17:36:40] <Demosthenex> zebrag: i don't get it
[17:36:52] <Demosthenex> zettlekasten w/ org is MORE files, not less.
[17:36:58] <Demosthenex> inherently more complex.
[17:37:20] <Demosthenex> i can't explain why you're losing notes. that's odd.
[17:37:36] <Demosthenex> i'd suggest make one file, and stick to that, until you're comfortable with how you're organized.
[17:37:41] <Demosthenex> this doesn't sound like a tooling issue

[19:00:14] <zebrag> Yes, yes, yes, even though what you say may seem "lame", it really is useful.
[19:01:31] <zebrag> The reason why I lose and duplicate notes, is because I'm taking notes inside the project I'm working on at the moment I'm writing the notes.
[19:01:52] <zebrag> For the present, until now,
[19:02:31] <zebrag> I use the readme.txt/org/md system
[19:02:48] <zebrag> So my notes are scattered everywhere.
[19:03:31] <zebrag> And what they contain, well let be clear, I can't find it again after.
[19:03:56] <zebrag> Web links are duplicated
[19:04:43] <rdrg109> Set org-refile-targets to every Org Mode file which holds your notes, then use C-u org-refile, and you will be shown a completion list with the name of all headlines present in any of those files and when you select one, the cursor will be moved to the position of that headline.
[19:04:46] <zebrag> When I wrote something about a given point, I have a hard time finding where I put that note.
[19:04:59] <rdrg109> Thus, you won't lose your notes anymore
[19:05:53] <rdrg109> Here's an article that mentions that: https://sachachua.com/blog/2015/02/learn-take-notes-efficiently-org-mode/
[19:06:14] <rdrg109> Well, I understood the concept of org-refile thanks to that article
[19:06:16] <zebrag> rdrg109: point taken, I'll look into it asap. (for the refile thing)
[19:07:34] <zebrag> About sachachua, sachachua is always awesome, though to be honest, her not taking system relies a lot on drawings, which is awesome, but, different
[19:10:08] <zebrag> Beside that: Demosthenex "i'd suggest make one file, and stick to that, until you're comfortable with how you're organized." Seems a very good suggestion.
[19:10:56] <zebrag> Beside that, everybody use org-mode for TODO, and nobody use it for `note-taking` and knowledge-base
[19:11:11] <zebrag> I mean statistically
[19:11:28] <grym> the OG use case
[19:11:44] <zebrag> Hence howto in that matter are scarce
[19:11:47] <zebrag> OG?
[19:11:51] <grym> first
[19:11:56] <grym> org was born as a todo list

[19:20:49] <zebrag> "The OG use case." I think I managed the grammar, and the rest of it. Well, not bad. (From the brainpan POV.)
[19:21:03] <zebrag> I've got to read what sachachua has to say

[19:53:48] <zebrag> I've set `(setq org-id-link-to-org-use-id t)`, and made a capture using "t", from https://orgmode.org/manual/Capture-templates.html#Capture-templates, and no property drawer was created with ":ID:" in it
[19:54:14] <zebrag> But strangely the second time I made a capture, the drawer was created
[19:54:54] <zebrag> Has there been some initialization process taking place during the first call to org-capture?
