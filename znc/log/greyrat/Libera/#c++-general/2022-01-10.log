[03:20:34] <RandomReader> in C++20, you use the u8 prefixes on literals where appropriate, and store data in std::u8string
[03:21:25] <RandomReader> unfortunately that's about all you can do, since none of the I/O supports that .. e.g. using iostreams isn't going to work, most popular libraries aren't going to either, etc
[03:22:00] <RandomReader> so the practical answer? use std::string, and manually verify every single place you use it expects / is set to work with UTF-8
[03:22:13] <RandomReader> which isn't going to be any kind of portable, always platform-specific

[14:13:17] <jokoon> whats the good news about modules? still not part of c++21?
[14:13:50] <jokoon> I still wonder how much work it will require for library developers
[14:15:24] <leduyquang753> There is no such thing as C++21.
[14:15:58] <leduyquang753> Modules are standardized in C++2020. MSVC has official support while GCC has experimental support.
[14:16:22] <sprout_> you only live once.  I am in the process of converting a smallish interpreter to c++20 modules and I am bewildered
[14:17:29] <sprout_> where does my 'assert' macro go?  how do I import iostream? where are the libicu modules?
[14:18:03] <sprout_> what about my own macros? where do compile time constants go?
[14:18:12] <comrad> heh, i once tried to verge into Java Modules, same thing. Nothing works anymore - sort of.
[14:18:14] <sprout_> no idea
[14:20:25] <sprout_> the problem is that with modules all the trilliions of lines of legacy code would preferably be rewritten.   in a clear consistent manner
[14:21:29] <sprout_> not to mention cmake
[14:22:14] <sprout_> the build process changes too.  then do I give modules .ixx,  .cppm,  or .cpp extensions?
[14:23:04] <sprout_> I want to do it but no clear answers anywhere.
[14:23:29] <johnny> sprout_, the thing coming maybe with c++23 is that basically everything in std is available by import std;
[14:23:41] <johnny> there's a paper for that somewhere
[14:24:04] <johnny> atm, it's pretty much on the programmer side or build system side to decide how to expose modules and by what name
[14:24:07] <sprout_> like,  for Zeus' sake.  I don't care about .ixx,  .cppm,  or .cpp.  can't somebody in industry not just toss a coin and tell everyone what it'll be
[14:24:17] <johnny> c++ committee won't do that
[14:24:37] <sprout_> I don't care who does it,  at long as someone does
[14:24:53] <sprout_> *as
[14:26:08] <sprout_> then make a different committee.  the C++ industrial guideline consortium,  no problem
[14:26:12] <johnny> .cpp isn't even standardized
[14:26:49] <johnny> lots of folks use .cc for example. and then there's header files.. so many folks still use .h or .hpp or something else
[14:27:04] <johnny> so as you can see, the cpp committee does not care about such things
[14:27:31] <sprout_> what I said,  then push a different committee
[14:27:32] <johnny> i think it's silly .. but that's just how they are
[14:27:34] <johnny> who?
[14:27:38] <JohnMS_WORK> We use .cpp for C++ definition files, .h for declarations, and .hpp for mixed declaration & definitions.
[14:27:51] <johnny> the committee is made up of stakeholders who contribute to making c++
[14:27:59] <johnny> so.. a new committee would have no teeth and thus no point

[19:46:06] <CarloWood> As you see, by ADL both N::f and M::f are found because N::A is derived from M::B.

[20:04:37] <jkaye> Not the individual detail that you are working on
[20:04:50] <jkaye> Please state your end goal. "Find the namespace" is not it
[20:04:58] <rpav> like, if you have a simple explanation for why you're doing this, please do tell; if you can't, consider that _you_ may be the one who doesn't understand what you're doing
[20:05:04] <CarloWood> I already explained that in great length yesterday - but I'll explain it again.
[20:05:20] <rpav> it _appears_ you only want to implement operator<< for things with print_on in a specific namespace, but it's still unclear why you'd make this restriction
[20:06:56] <rpav> notably this is one really great example of why keeping most peripheral things separate from class members is good .. e.g., you should not implement C::print_on, but print_on(ostream&, const C&) (or really, print_adl<T>::print_on(ostream&, const T&))
[20:07:41] <CarloWood> What I want is being able to do: std::cout << foo;   or any ostream for that matter, in *any* namespace where foo is a class type defined in *any* (possibly different or the same) namespace for which no operator<< is defined but that has the member function `void print_on(std::ostream&) const`. And then have foo.print_on(std::cout) being called.
[20:07:53] <rpav> but if you must because you're dealing with a bunch of random crap that implements print_on or to_string or somesuch, then the question is more why are you making the arbitrary restriction and do you have a real case for doing so
[20:08:10] <CarloWood> Is that an acceptable starting point? Or do you still see that as a possible xy problem?
[20:08:12] <rpav> CarloWood: ah, yeah, that's where you want the laundering struct
[20:09:09] <rpav> e.g. i have a <T> toStream(ostream&, const T&), but that calls by default a <T> struct stream_adl { static void toStream(...); };
[20:10:23] <rpav> pretty sure you'd want similar with an operator<< just so you can trivially not get screwed over by adl when you call it in random places
[20:11:19] <CarloWood> Now I can't follow you. And you didn't answer my question it seems. You think that my starting point is wrong?
[20:11:22] <rpav> though tbh i'm not sure how ADL impacts a decltype lookup in this case for a global-namespaced operator<<
[20:13:08] <CarloWood> I use << a lot for debug output. So I have everywhere (in every namespaces) code where I << some_type, where some_type is declared in any namespace. I want that to work.
[20:13:22] <rpav> right
[20:13:36] <CarloWood> You have to start with telling me if that is an accepting starting point or not, or the rest would be a waste of time.

[20:15:35] <rpav> yes
[20:15:50] <CarloWood> And also that the type that I am writing can be in any namespace?
[20:15:52] <rpav> this however does not require looking up something's namespace
[20:16:06] <Alipha> You can declare a operator<< which would sfinae whether or not the class has a print_on
[20:16:13] <rpav> or really caring about namespace at all, except that ADL is a pain in the ass sometimes
[20:16:16] <CarloWood> I already have that Alipha
[20:16:19] <rpav> Alipha: exactly
[20:16:34] <CarloWood> Didn't get a yes or no on my last question.
[20:16:43] <Alipha> CarloWood: and you're getting ambiguous calls?
[20:17:16] <CarloWood> Alipha: yup, that is the problem. But rpav refuses to address the real issue because he thinks I have an xy problem.
[20:17:27] <CarloWood> See https://wandbox.org/permlink/MmJLyHhaxy1G9ooh
[20:17:29] <rpav> and you're being an ass and i don't really have time to deal with it
[20:17:36] <CarloWood> That exactly shows the problem that I have now.
[20:17:55] <rpav> ambiguous call resolution does not require looking up namespaces
[20:19:05] <CarloWood> rpav: this is why I didn't like to even begin this time wasting discussion. We spent some time talking about it and then you'd bail. You didn't even WANT to say 'yes' to trivial questions to get a common ground; which clearly shows you are in a defensive position and not really interested in tackling the PROBLEM, rather to just prove I am wrong and you are right.
[20:19:30] <rpav> i've already pointed out how solving this is accomplished, actually
[20:19:32] <rpav> multiple times
[20:20:03] <CarloWood> I didn't see a single line of code from you just a few meaningless keyword that you probably defined in your own code.
[20:20:50] *** Joins: varioust (~varioust@gateway/tor-sasl/varioust)
[20:21:06] <rpav> the ADL struct thing ought to have a commonly-known name in C++ by now tbh; i've seen it used in a lot of places, i've used it in a number of places, and it seems like a thing that ought to be a well-known C++ pattern
[20:21:07] <Alipha> CarloWood: why do you have two different operator<< and not just one?
[20:21:14] *** Joins: magla (~gelignite@55d483f5.access.ecotel.net)
[20:21:20] <CarloWood> If you get yourself to say that you are OK with using   << foo  in any namespace, where foo is a type from any namespace, and where foo only has a print_on method. Then I can finally start to explain why that requires the problem that I asked about half an hour ago. Because it does.
[20:21:32] <rpav> but i'm actually not even sure why it'd be necessary here so i'm trying to reproduce your goal and find an actual problem
[20:21:32] <CarloWood> Alipha: while lines?
[20:23:27] <CarloWood> Alipha: ok line 20 and 54.  Because one is in namespace N and the other in namespace M.
[20:24:30] <CarloWood> That is required... if I only have one in namespace N, then I can't print types M::Foo from global namespace or from M.
[20:25:47] <CarloWood> And if I'd have only one in global namespace then I can't find that when there is even a single other operator<< defined in (say) namespace N when printing from namespace N, because it will find the one in N before it finds the one in global namespace (ie, never find that one)
[20:26:22] <CarloWood> You need to define the operator<<'s in the namespace of the types that you want to print them with, or it can never work.
[20:26:30] <CarloWood> So, I need one in every namespace.
[20:26:40] <CarloWood> And THAT leads to ambiguity.
[20:27:05] <CarloWood> If you try to print M::Foo from namespace N, it find the operator<<'s in N and in M.
[20:27:15] *** Joins: williampiv (~williampi@ip24-254-86-223.sb.sd.cox.net)
[20:27:56] <CarloWood> So - I tried to solve that by detecting if the type that you try to print (M::Foo) is actually from the namespace that the operator<<'s that you try to find is defined in (using SFINAE).
[20:28:21] <CarloWood> And that works well, unless you try to print a type that is defined in namespace N, but derived from a type in namespace M.
[20:29:02] <Haohmaru> wouldn't the "::blah" syntax help?
[20:29:15] <CarloWood> rpav: see all of the above; that is the full explanation.
[20:30:57] <Haohmaru> { cout << ::vector; } using namespace std; string vector = "asdf";
[20:30:58] <geordi> asdf
[20:33:05] *** Joins: AbleBacon (~AbleBacon@user/AbleBacon)
[20:33:40] <CarloWood> So, if I put this in EVERY namespace (that has such print_on types):
[20:34:02] <CarloWood> template<typename T>
[20:34:02] <CarloWood> std::enable_if_t<utils::has_print_on<T const> && in_namespace_M<T>, std::ostream&>
[20:34:02] <CarloWood> operator<<(std::ostream& os, T const& obj) { obj.print_on(os); return os; }
[20:34:35] <CarloWood> Then that will work perfectly - *iff* in_namespace_M<T> would work :/  (this one being defined in namespace M).
[20:35:53] <CarloWood> So, back to my original question :/ ...
[20:36:44] <CarloWood> How can I get that in_namespace_M<T> work when T is a type defined in namespace N, but derived from a class defined in namespace M?
[20:37:27] <Haohmaru> x_x
[20:37:32] <PJBoy> you can't detect if something's in a namespace AFAIK
[20:38:17] <CarloWood> PJBoy: boy it seems so. Although I saw a non-portable version once that used std::type_info::name.
[20:38:21] <CarloWood> s/boy//
[20:38:40] <CarloWood> (I typed a space there:  PJ boy: ... )
[20:38:53] <Haohmaru> in mIRC script you can probe whether some "function" is or isn't defined, and if it is - in which script file it is and on which line it begins ;P~
[20:40:05] *** Joins: AmR (~AmREiSa@41.238.31.212)
[20:41:10] <CarloWood> I have hunderds of classes and I just hate to have to define a std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream&, Foo const&) for all of them. The only reasonable way to go would be to use a macro that declares the print_on AND the friend operator<< in one go... And that seems silly/annoying, to have to resort to macros :/
[20:41:21] <CarloWood> hundreds*
[20:41:39] <Alipha> CarloWood: https://wandbox.org/permlink/qKZt5cJc3wTGfmKh
[20:43:30] <PJBoy> you could probably just write an operator<<(ostream&, auto) in your namespace
[20:43:35] <CarloWood>  Alipha: wow
[20:43:43] <PJBoy> that should get ADL'd I think
[20:43:53] <CarloWood> You are often so brilliant. I feel humbled.
[20:44:45] <CarloWood> Absolutely brilliant - this way it doesn't complain about the ambiguity because they are really the same operator<< !
[20:47:34] <Alipha> PJBoy: the problem is there's two namespaces, M and N, so he wants his operator<< available to both (so his solution was to write separate M::operator<< and N::operator<< functions). But M::C inherits from N::B, so both namespaces get included in ADL
[20:49:15] <PJBoy> doesn't ADL end up preferring M::operator<< in that case?
[20:49:43] <CarloWood> The next hour I am going to sort out the mess in 'git diff' that I made, to end up with this solution :) :)
[20:50:56] <PJBoy> guess not :/
[20:51:17] <CarloWood> PJBoy: no, it looks in the current namespace (and parents if it finds nothing) and in the namespace of each argument (and parents of those if it finds nothing) and the namespace of base classes thereof (etc), all with the same priority.
[20:51:18] <Alipha> PJBoy: you would think so :-/

[22:30:53] <Alipha> because an operator<< was found in namespace M, even though it doesn't match, the compiler won't look for operator<< in outer scopes
[22:31:32] <rpav> i thought you weren't supposed to overload operator<< in a local namespace for that anyway actually
[22:32:09] <rpav> but `using ::operator<<;` is also sufficient
[22:32:29] <rpav> before the local definition of course :p
[22:32:59] <Alipha> indeed, `using ::operator<<:` works in your case. though if you're going to go ahead and have that using, i'd just throw operator<< into a different namespace and do `using PrintOn::operator<<;` imo
[22:34:16] <rpav> i could have sworn there was some guidance about "don't define operator<< in a namespace"
[22:34:34] <rpav> but really if i was going to go to _that_ trouble... well i'd do what i said i did ;)

[23:47:47] <CarloWood> rpav: because: <CarloWood> And if I'd have only one in global namespace then I can't find that when there is even a single other operator<< defined in (say) namespace N when printing from namespace N, because it will find the one in N before it finds the one in global namespace (ie, never find that one)
[23:48:16] <CarloWood> for example... https://godbolt.org/z/366Kd3Phe
[23:48:17] <rpav> CarloWood: again, don't define operator<< in a namespace :p
[23:48:38] <rpav> though also, probably just avoid the whole mess
[23:48:59] <rpav> and/or `using ::operator<<;`
[23:49:23] <cbreak> LordKalma: yes... I guess that's why there's only one web browser left nowadays. And chrome. :(
[23:49:37] <CarloWood> I am pretty sure operator<<'s should be found by ADL, and not put them ALL in global namespace, hoping that really nobody ever will declare a single one in a namespace.
[23:49:39] <LordKalma> ahaha chrome and a half-dying one
[23:49:47] <rpav> what, people use firefox?
[23:49:53] <LordKalma> I do
[23:49:56] <LordKalma> dunno why still
[23:49:59] <cbreak> Yes. You can chose: web browser, or spyware? :)
[23:50:10] <rpav> you think firefox isn't
[23:50:13] <cbreak> well, I guess you can get both at once with chrome
[23:50:33] <rpav> most of the important "spy" stuff is browser-independent in any case
[23:50:55] <cbreak> depends on who's spying

[23:51:21] <rpav> not really; google knows all whether you use their browser or not
[23:51:30] <cbreak> depends.
[23:51:39] <cbreak> firefox containers make this a bit harder with newer versions
[23:52:15] <rpav> 🤷 google is sortof the least of my concerns

[23:59:21] <LordKalma> qt 6.3 will likely ship the general preview of the qml->c++ compiler
