[15:30:54] <ede> [citation needed]
[15:32:07] <susi> firefox 1.7 used to be good
[15:32:25] <susi> constant downhill since then
[15:36:49] <ede> my system is under heave load as usual after opening a few pages and navigating a bit, but....
[15:37:36] <ede> the fact that i REGULARLY move tabs into a new window and just like now need MINUTES to get them back is something mozilla is to be blamed for.
[15:38:28] <ede> i can't type anything not directly available on my keyboard (hint: Compose), it loses events (keypresses, button releases(mostly)) all the time
[15:39:58] <susi> I have very low-end computer with 4G RAM (of which only 3.7G is addressable for use), and no problems with Firefox
[15:40:11] <susi> I usually have about 500 tabs open
[15:40:25] <ede> just like maybe 5 minutes before. i moved the cursor to a tab header, pressed the button for a very short fraction of a second (i played doom and descent in the 90s already, so yeah), moved away the mouse, nothing happened. half a minute later or so i had the tab in a new window in front of the old one
[15:40:50] <ede> susi: 2GB here, and the swap is on a really old HDD
[15:40:57] <susi> lol
[15:41:11] <susi> then no wonder you have problems, and would have with any browser
[15:41:25] <ede> and yes, i use the same sites i used a decade ago, even on this PCs successor and it wasn't half that bad.
[15:41:48] <ede> lagging is one thing, but ignoring or creating random events is a code issue
[15:41:54] <susi> pretty sure those websites have updated since then, and now use all the modern libraries and stuff
[15:42:00] <susi> as does Firefox and all other browsers
[15:42:28] <ede> been on twitter at that moment, tried to drag back that tab into the tab bar, all it did was to move up the whole window
[15:42:50] <susi> anyway, you could do something about that with uBO, uMatrix, Decentraleyes and arkenfox's user.js (https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js)
[15:42:56] <labrador> > i can't type anything not directly available on my keyboard
[15:42:57] <susi> they reduce memory footprint
[15:42:58] <labrador> ibus?
[15:43:35] <ede> then when it finally happened after half a dozen tries, another tab was active and something from twitter's left sidebar had been selected which i definitely didn't press.
[15:43:45] <labrador> ctrl+shit+u and then four hexadecimal digits and an enter should work ede 
[15:44:07] <labrador> like this 슠
[15:44:10] <ede> seems that the LMB down on the tab header in the foreground window was sent to the background window also
[15:44:17] <ede> which is something i never had before
[15:44:45] <ede> labrador, went through all of this before, nothing works.
[15:45:15] <susi> switch your kernels to something more appropriate, even the zen kernel could do
[15:45:20] <susi> it helped me with such lagging issues
[15:45:26] <labrador> huh thats weird ede 
[15:46:09] <ede> and yes, i had ibus running for a while, changed the layout a bit but else not much difference. now i stop it right after login, not because of ressources or something, but it opens the option window (note, not the normal settings) at a minimal size like 8x2 pixels or something. can't even click it, but it is there.
[15:46:20] <susi> can I send you a working SSD ede or why don't you have one

[15:46:52] <susi> even a USB flash would be better swap than slow mechanical disk
[15:47:16] <ede> some days ago it opened in the corner, so i could place the cursor on top of it, rightclick didn't open the desktop context menu anymore, so i leftclicked and tried to alt+space for the window menu. no reaction. killed it from htop, so yes, it was that process.
[15:47:34] <ede> btw, Compose in hexchat: ☭
[15:47:54] <susi> start irssing to reduce memory footprint
[15:47:59] <ede> all i have to do is to select Simple as Input Method, then it works.
[15:48:27] <ede> lol, i'm at about 300+MB before i start firefox. let me close it for a moment.
[15:50:22] <ede> 2 windows with 17 tabs and 1 with 1 tab
[15:50:35] <susi> why do yo even have multiple windows
[15:50:45] <susi> I always use just one becase having two uses extra
[15:53:53] <ede> turning of swap, just to have a clearer number, takes a bit ;)

[15:56:37] <ede> now let me swapon and restart firefox
[15:57:04] <Iamthehuman1> Came to my mind just like 30 seconds ago.... If I right click on a link, there is no "open in another window" (which would have the windows as subitems to select), there is just "open in new window" and the rest
[15:57:47] <susi> 71M :D more than Xorg
[15:58:12] <ede> 96 for the profile manager only!
[15:58:15] <Iamthehuman1> it'd be awesome to avoid "open in new tab" -> "drag tab to another window" -> "refocus to the right tab in the window where the tab was dragged from (it goes to first unpinned tab)
[15:59:12] <ede> Iamthehuman1: press shift, some sites manipulate the context menu, with shift the keypress seems to be ignored by their scripts.
[15:59:14] <Iamthehuman1> .. if we could just select "Open tab to another window" and choose which window (that needs UI)
[15:59:21] <susi> my ircing takes 12000K and even that's a horrible amount
[16:00:12] <ede> susi: yeah, i heavily increased the backbuffer and i have 5 networks open, the sidebar is 3/4 full :)
[16:00:32] <ede> and i don't use Gnome style monster buttons.
[16:01:13] <susi> but please install uBO, uMatrix and Decentraleyes, and arkenfox's user.js. that will help a bit with your memory management issues
[16:01:36] <ede> <susi> why do yo even have multiple windows <-- the one with single tab is for a streaming site i consume sometimes. tv, not music, so not just for minutes.

[16:02:19] <susi> why it can't be in the same window as other stuff?
[16:02:20] <ede> i resized it to fit nicely into the corner, would really be nice if i actually could remove all of the chrome and framing and everything
[16:02:32] <ede> just like with mpv
[16:02:55] <susi> I have just 809 custom rules in uMatrix to make the sites I frequently use usable
[16:03:11] <ede> i know, there's this PiP thing or what it's called, but i think it's not resizeable meh
[16:03:59] <ede> ah, addons, yeah. still that temporary profile, maybe i'll be able to get back to the regular one and include this one's history and stuff over the weekend.
[16:04:35] <ede> i always had a lot of entries in the hosts file, also proactive noscript.
[16:05:28] <ede> <ede> 96 for the profile manager only!
[16:05:36] <ede> 99.6M now and i just ignored it since.
[16:06:21] <susi> it's not a big deal to include history and stuff in another profile
[16:06:43] <susi> maybe you don't even need the history, but let it stay in the old profile, so did I
[16:06:56] <susi> then build a new history on the new profile
[16:08:23] <katsuragi> Is there an unmozilla-firefox browser like ungoogled-chromium?
[16:09:10] <Iamthehuman1> ede shift + right click gives same menu as right click without shift
