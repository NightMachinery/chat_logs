[00:19:22] <pagios>  ok so i am planning to migrate once and for all to something minimalistic, scalable , stable and have a good EOL, i thought of the stack postfix,dovecot, and some webmail interface, what do you guys recommend?
[00:19:23] <pagios> 22:47 pagios: zimbra allows me to login to user accounts webmail using my admin password, can i use imapsync to copu.a usermail box using my admin pass ?
[00:19:23] <pagios> 22:47 pagios: i dont know the user's passwords and dont want to reset
[00:20:14] <lunaphyte> if it were me, i'd set up an openldap cluster, and transition the zimbra directory services cluster over to it
[00:21:22] <lunaphyte> you could either add the new cluster into the zimbra mmr cluster, or do it separately, and migrate the directory contents
[00:21:27] <lunaphyte> i'd probably do the latter
[00:22:23] <pagios> wow thats beyond my skills
[00:23:09] <pagios> lunaphyte: ok so zimbra stores all the mails and indexes and uuids in ldap
[00:23:35] <pagios> you would setup an openldap server and migrate the ldap part from zimbra to openldap if i understand correctly?
[00:26:04] <pagios> lunaphyte:  why not use imapsync

[00:56:26] <pagios> expensive for multiple user
[00:56:35] <Khepra> is it
[00:57:18] <Khepra> even when you include teh cost of you learning, making mistakes, setting up everything, having a low bus factor, losing email, getting angry phone calls, etc... ?
[01:08:51] <lunaphyte> pagios: use imapsync for what?

[04:05:46] <lunaphyte> pagios: yes that's correct
[04:06:07] <lunaphyte> how does copying mail relate to "i dont know the user's passwords and dont want to reset"?
[04:44:46] <jaybe> lunaphyte: do you really wish to subject yourself to the answer?
[04:45:05] <jaybe> i suppose it is the responsible thing to do - to follow through ;)

[05:27:39] <pj> many IMAP servers have a master account or password option that when set can be used to login and transfer the mail for any account without needing the individual password for that account.  I don't know specifically if Zimbra has such an option but it may be worth looking into.

[08:42:18] <jaybe> ah i recall reading that long, long ago; kindled
[09:13:48] <pagios> when copuing with imapsync do i preserve the email flags and meta stuff that comes with it ?
[09:14:07] <pagios> if user switches to new server from his phone configuration will it be seamless
[09:14:20] <jaybe> you'll want to test that
[09:14:22] <lunaphyte> are you asking what will happen?
[09:14:45] <lunaphyte> if so, that's not a great idea.  what if we're wrong?
