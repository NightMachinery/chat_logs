Doing the same to a "daily driver" can lead to a lot more angst.  In short: for systems that require software that may bork your system every couple of weeks, it's easier to
[01:07:59] <apotheon> isolate them from real work so you can nuke and pave in a couple hours and be back to full function.

[01:12:52] <apotheon> phogg: As such, I try to give the before-I-tried variant the benefit of the doubt.
[01:13:28] <phogg> apotheon: I have never used Arch, but I have seen the effects of it in ##linux since it was created. Lots of confused users with broken systems.
[01:13:54] <bjs> node1: a lattice is a generalization of the <= relation.  Lots of things "look like" <=. There is a lot of mathematics that takes things you know, and asks what their generalization is and what those generalizations get you.
[01:14:11] <apotheon> nomagno: The VM is still somewhat limited.  You probably won't get what you expect, given your questions, there.  Perhaps FreeBSD is what you want for that.  I hear great things about bhyve.
[01:14:12] <phogg> apotheon: There's nothing wrong without it *except* that it is marketed as a distribution normal people should use. It's not for normies, it's for weird people who like it when their system breaks and they have to fix it.
[01:14:52] <apotheon> Oh, well, the "for normies" thing has always seemed like a bad thing to preach about Arch.  I was talking about its utility for *me*.

[01:15:12] <node1> ok
[01:15:14] <bjs> node1: if you prove something about lattices in general, or sets, or groups, or relations then when you come across something and go "oh, this forms a lattice" or "oh this is a relation" then the studies of those objects give you lots of insight

[03:17:18] <flakland> usually there are line numbers in there, and a pattern to match
[03:17:42] <JyZyXy> right, but the line numbers don't need to match? it supposed to find the offset automatically?

[03:19:06] <tomathy> 4 years it took me to read a chapter of a book and finish all the exercises
[03:20:12] <beaky> yes the files and failing hunk details like line number and offset is the most information it will give it (and you have to manually figure out the problem) sadly wont get more specific than that (like how rust compiler error messages suggest a fix)
[03:20:55] *** Quits: tomathy (~jenova@user/quetzl) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:22:22] <beaky> even if the reason for the failing hunk is because of a whitespace problem like if you have tabs on the original file but the hunk in the patch has spaces as indentation but in this specific case there are tweaks like fuzz factor and ignore whitespace to help it process the hunk anyway (but it wont clearly tell you it failed because of whitespace unless you can see the whitespace difference
[03:22:24] <beaky> by manually inspecting the file and patch)
[03:23:27] <Sqaure> github doesnt seem to offer free free openid? But its quite often you see GitHub as an option?!
[03:23:39] <JyZyXy> only reason i can think of is that the hunk line numbers are outside bounds of the linecount
[03:25:45] <JyZyXy> nope that was not it, unless they need to be bang on

[10:28:28] <chives> in powershlel
[10:29:05] <chives> i have an array and a directory i want to make sure its not the same
[10:33:30] <chives> sounds too complicated huh was wanting to just basically walk the alphabet single char then double char etc for each file
[10:34:36] <pyzozord> in some sense pointers are the opposite of arrays
[10:35:03] <chives> im trying to basically rename a whole bunch of folders recursively
[10:35:15] <chives> trying to keep them unique throughout though
[10:35:25] *** Telvana2 is now known as Telvana
[10:35:46] <chives> because i may move them to a non-nested folder

[10:36:35] <chives> lengths*
[10:36:36] <pyzozord> something like this I guess
[10:36:51] <pyzozord> hmm maybe not

[10:58:22] <blahboybaz> Has anyone heard of quirks mode on the web? I came across a wierd website where all you see is a blank white page when the page loads but there is actually lots of code there
[10:59:32] <blahboybaz> view page source loads an-other blank white page. Developer tools shows a network connection is beign made and that there is a lot of code there if you dig for it. Whois shows the url is registered

[11:00:20] <pyzozord> I think this one sorts directories by nested first find . -type d |sort -t'/' -k2.2r -k2.1
[11:00:33] <user51> is it possible to replace every text entry box in firefox with my favorite text editor?
[11:00:52] <pyzozord> so for f in $(find . -type d |sort -t'/' -k2.2r -k2.1); do echo mv $f $f-new; done should rename all directories recurisvely
[11:01:14] <vdamewood> blahboybaz: Uh, okay. Almost none of that has to do with Quirks mode.
[11:01:17] *** Quits: spinningCat (~spinningC@about/web/muscles) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[11:01:39] <vdamewood> Quirks mode is just something web browsers do when they parse non-standard HTML.
[11:01:41] *** Joins: AquaL1te (~AquaL1te@user/aqual1te)
[11:01:57] <blahboybaz> vdamewood: Well ff says the site is in quirks mode (in developer tools)
[11:02:08] <pyzozord> quirks mode was a thing in 10s I didn't hear it since last ten years
[11:02:29] <vdamewood> Quirks mode was a thing int he 90s too.
[11:02:40] <pyzozord> probably even more so
[11:02:51] <vdamewood> <blink>
[11:03:05] <blahboybaz> Is there a way to get the page to display?
[11:03:17] <blahboybaz> The ff doc about quirks mode doesn't address that
[11:03:52] <vdamewood> Well, if it doesn't display, it probably has nothing to do with quirks mode, except maybe that the bad HTML code is unrenderable.
[11:04:22] <blahboybaz> hmm
[11:04:45] <blahboybaz> Well I find it intriguing to know what is there (to display the page)
[11:05:12] <blahboybaz> Maybe if I visit it with Netscape Navigator?
[11:06:33] <deniska> Site should mention which browser it's best viewed on
[11:07:09] <pyzozord> these old stickers "works best on ie6"

[11:08:34] <deniska> pyzozord: supporting IE was easy, the hard part was supporting everything else in a way which wouldn't break IE
[11:08:52] <deniska> but other browsers didn't really exist so nobody cared :P

[11:09:34] <blahboybaz> hmm
[11:09:42] <deniska> some web developers never test their sites in anything besides chrome and maybe iOS safari
[11:09:44] <blahboybaz> well, ok, I guess
[11:09:46] <blahboybaz> :)
[11:10:00] <user51> there's a 1600x1200 12.3 but it's slightly too big, and i don't think it has enough LVDS for that

[17:22:03] <maxzor_> vdamewood, right, right, whatever
[17:22:15] <merijn> transpiling is a stupid word that only exists because some JS people somehow decided "compiling" must always refer to "to a lower language", implying some weird non-sensical notion of the existence of a total ordering on "lower" and "higher" languages as if that makes any sense
[17:22:25] <maxzor_> thank you, will stick to compiling
[17:22:59] <maxzor_> is such source-to-source compiling the future? Is it MLIR?
[17:23:09] <maxzor_> (that was for ROCm wikipedia article)
[17:23:29] <deniska> it's an interesting technique for sure, and it has its uses
[17:23:49] <merijn> maxzor_: I think it's a useful tool for many problems
[17:23:57] <deniska> sometimes you may even compile from an arguable lower level language to a higher level one: https://github.com/turbolent/w2c2

[17:36:24] <maxzor_> what-is human readable?
[17:36:27] <deniska> maxzor_: transpiling is a subset of compiling. Which subset? "You know it when you see it" kind of subset :)
[17:36:46] <FloridaMan> yeah that "you know it when you see it" is the issue I think
[17:36:55] <FloridaMan> because some people...well, don't know
[17:36:56] <FloridaMan> heh
[17:37:03] <merijn> I never see it, easy :p
[17:38:01] <merijn> transpiling mostly was invented because people were too embarassed to call what they were doing compilation. Because the hardest thing about writing a compiler is "admitting to yourself you're writing a compiler"
[17:38:23] <maxzor_> and not writing 1000 regexes one after the other

[17:38:47] <merijn> The 1000 regexes is usually a result of "refusing to admit your writing a compiler", yes ;)
[17:39:06] <deniska> the only problem with regexes is that they're not recursive :D
[17:39:12] <FloridaMan> maybe the line between compilation and transpilation can be use of an AST tree or something
[17:39:20] <FloridaMan> -tree

[17:40:05] <FloridaMan> I think it should be "compiler" then
[17:40:07] <vdamewood> maxzor_: "does notinvolve machine code" would mean that gcc is a transpiler, since gcc itself only translates to assembly.
[17:40:29] <maxzor_> but it's crazy how the "1000 regexes" approach has succedeed, more than Chomsky-correct developments: javascript, PHP, Wikimedia markup...
[17:41:23] <FloridaMan> "1000 regexes" would be genuine transpilation imo

[18:26:01] <jsmooth> This may be a dumb question, but I'll ask anyway. I have a smaller company for an email provider and premium is required for desktop email client support.

[18:29:48] <nomagno> I do not consider a free plan that locks you to their web interface acceptable
[18:30:07] <merijn> also, email hosting is cheap and relying on free email hosting makes it extremely questionable how they are earning money off of hosting your email...
[18:30:07] <xeno> well, it's free, you get what you pay for 
[18:30:09] <nomagno> Like, that's just being annoying. Make it paid or do not make it paid
[18:31:31] <nomagno> There are plenty services with IMAP/SMTP/POP3 integration that have free plans
[18:31:54] <nomagno> I think it's just a dirty place to put a paywall
[18:32:14] <nomagno> Like, that's literally email provider lock-in
[18:32:24] <nomagno> You give out your email to a few people, then realize you need to use the web interface
[18:32:30] <nomagno> Good luck switching now!

[18:32:49] <deniska> I think the best option is owning your domain
[18:32:53] <merijn> nomagno: So you can switch
[18:32:57] <deniska> than changing email providers is relatively painless
[18:33:08] <deniska> then*
[18:33:31] <merijn> If you're not paying for email and using your own domain (ideally registered in a location that is judicially convenient for you), you're kinda asking to get fucked

[22:14:13] <sonny> but more and more I just don't see any reason for dynamic languages
[22:15:10] <pyzozord> one thing that I think dynamic languages are at is the dynamic part :P
[22:15:12] <pyzozord> let me explain
[22:15:27] <sonny> can you imagine if C decided not to have types? lol
[22:15:39] <sonny> sure, explain
[22:15:39] <GeDaMo> That would be BCPL
[22:15:49] <pyzozord> I mean for interpreted languages, there is no compilation step, code can be freely loaded, unloaded and modified in runtime
[22:16:13] <Thedarkb-Desktop> I think B is just C without a type system.
[22:16:19] <pyzozord> you can say that can be done with static languages too, but that's with much more effort
[22:16:22] <GeDaMo> "The language is unusual in having only one data type: a word,  a fixed number of bits, usually chosen to align with the architecture's  machine word and of adequate capacity to represent any valid storage  address." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCPL
[22:16:22] <bayaz> Title: BCPL - Wikipedia 
[22:16:22] <Thedarkb-Desktop> Along with a few other changes.
[22:16:30] <Thedarkb-Desktop> BCPL is like B but more verbose.
[22:17:05] <sonny> ha, nice
[22:17:20] <sonny> I mean a word is the ultimate data type, it can represent anything
[22:17:38] <Amadiro> pyzozord, it's actually pretty much just as easy in C to load another piece of C code dynamically and execute a function from it -- that is, in principle easy
[22:17:46] <Amadiro> but in practice very hard to do anything useful with it
[22:17:53] <pyzozord> Amadiro: yes, but you must compile it first statically
[22:18:01] <Amadiro> only erlang really makes it easy in a useful way I think
[22:18:23] <pyzozord> also all the linkers and loaders, that somewhat more complex than just an interpreted language
[22:18:27] <sonny> doesn't visual c++ have this feature for debugging purposes?
[22:18:36] <Amadiro> that's true (but then, that's actually true of all modern languages -- truly interpreted languages don't actually really exist anymore)
[22:18:38] <sonny> pyzozord: yes it is more complex
[22:18:48] <nomagno> A virtual machine is the only real way to run C source dynamically from C
[22:19:03] <nomagno> Or a C interpreter... But good luck with that
[22:19:14] <Amadiro> there's one based on clang/llvm, called cling I think
[22:19:26] <sonny> HolyC
[22:19:26] <Amadiro> gdb is also kinda a C interpreter

[22:21:12] <Amadiro> so you can for instance connect your gdb frontend to a gdb server running on an embedded device via usb
[22:21:15] <sonny> yeah, quite complex
[22:21:21] <pyzozord> I looked at cpython's source not at gdb's source. But a fact that gdb /uses/ python as a scripting language, puts it firmly as a superset in terms of complexity

[22:33:41] <wedr> So... I'm stuck with App Passwords for the time being
[22:33:58] <wedr> But now that the DevOps is pushing me for SSH. What do I do? Oh ho ho no no no
