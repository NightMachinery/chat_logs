[00:09:33] <azazel> hoppity: have a look at https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Multi.html#content
[00:09:55] <hoppity> azazel: thank you
[00:11:25] <rawtaz> hoppity: what are you building?
[00:11:32] <rawtaz> it must be something super fancy
[00:12:06] <hoppity> rawtaz: I am building an internal hiring app for my company
[00:12:21] <rawtaz> oh, so just for internal HR needs? must be a pretty large company then?
[00:12:55] <hoppity> rawtaz: its small, but there is a lot of personnel coming in an out due to a lot of work being done in "contractor" mode
[00:13:01] <rawtaz> aha
[00:13:14] <rawtaz> hm have you checked if there are some existing open source software for that? i'd be surprised if there isnt
[00:13:25] <rawtaz> i know lever.co has something for it as well, but thats a paid service of course
[00:14:06] <hoppity> I have checked several different service providers but always find something missing
[00:14:28] <hoppity> In the past I've built internal apps for the company using Django and they have made a dramatic change in our operations, crappy as they may be haha
[00:16:13] <rawtaz> custom built stuff rocks when it comes to usability and productivity <3
[00:16:38] <rawtaz> pity those who are unable to create their own software when needed :<
[00:17:01] <hoppity> true that
[00:17:37] <hoppity> Another thing to consider is that if you ever sell your company, having your own secret sauce software can increase your value at the time of sell
[00:17:53] <hoppity> Since you can make an arguemtn that "you are awesome because of your custom software"
[00:18:11] <hoppity> I haven't done this myself, but know a couple of people who have

[14:52:57] <mhmd> what if I start the session and put it in an agent and supervise it?
[14:57:25] <mhmd> in code I see that it has its own supervisor, so the application supervisor will call start_link function in wallaby, which itself will call init, right?

[20:42:17] <josevalim> we want to stop people from having one component per module
[20:42:23] <josevalim> it is very wasteful
[20:42:29] <josevalim> it is functional programming, not module programming :)
[20:43:12] <Zarathu> ah, ok
[20:43:25] <Zarathu> well, at least this was on purpose :>
[20:45:38] <josevalim> next time you name a function component `render`, think of me wearing a disappointed face
[20:45:40] <josevalim> :D
[20:47:08] <Zarathu> i pasted you saying that into our dev guide as a warning to others

[20:48:13] <Zarathu> though, maybe the docs here could express that a bit:     viewbox = assigns[:viewbox]
[20:48:16] <Zarathu> oops
[20:48:20] <Zarathu> https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.Helpers.html#sigil_H/2
[20:49:11] <Zarathu> <MyApp.Weather.render city="Kraków">
[20:50:57] <josevalim> me sharing a disappointed face with the docs
[20:51:12] <josevalim> Zarathu: do you want to PR? or should I ?
[20:51:26] <josevalim> I think in some places we do this: <MyApp.Weather.city name="Kraków">

[20:52:40] <Zarathu> i'll submit a PR
[20:55:29] <Zarathu> i don't see a MyApp.Weather.city anywhere, but i can rename all the `MyApp.Weather.render`s i see

[21:04:13] <Zarathu> come here to complain and jose puts you to work 🙄

[23:02:32] <josevalim> Zarathu: you have been josé'd
[23:02:40] <josevalim> thanks for the PR :) running tests and then merging it
[23:10:00] <hoppity> can a user, somehow mess with the Phoenix assigns from the client side?
[23:13:05] <benwilson512> hoppity: no
[23:13:19] <hoppity> benwilson512: thank you
[23:13:35] <benwilson512> the assigns exist in the memory of the server, not the client
[23:21:21] <hoppity> benwilson512: thank you for that, I was worried that they could somehow change the assigns by messing with them once sent to the client for rendering
[23:21:51] <hoppity> but I guess they really *aren't* sent. Just the particular value that you ask for is.
[23:23:49] <benwilson512> yeah what the client gets is HTML
