[20:06:39] <greyrat> lispmacs: That  would need you to either run unsafe elisp on all your files, or allow the elisp each time you open that file (perhaps there is a way to cache the permissions though?)
[20:06:59] <lispmacs> 27.2 allows you to cache the permission for an individual file

[23:40:43] <technomancy> I'm finding this thread about UTF-16 in LSP just ... uproariously funny https://github.com/microsoft/language-server-protocol/issues/376
[23:41:31] <technomancy> the fact that they used UTF-16 in LSP on its own is hilarious, but then the fact that they're getting into arguments and that some people are actually defending the decision is just ... too much

[23:42:47] <dustfinger> When I run magit-status I am seeing the following error in the mode-line: with with-editor with-editor.elc failed to provide feature 'with-editor'. This started to happen after a recent update. Is there a fix or workaround?
[23:43:51] <rpav> karthik: not sure but it keeps getting confused about focus .. its ffm seems to behave poorly and some popups seem to leave random emacs windows focused
[23:44:24] <natter> github was a mistake
[23:44:35] <rpav> i find buffers with random lost letters typed, it's pretty annoying, not to mention something occasionally just causes what's focused to change entirely

[23:46:44] <technomancy> the funniest part is that they actually use UTF-8 for the transmission, because json
[23:47:02] <technomancy> but they somehow still managed to fuck it up by specifying the *character offsets* inside the UTF-8 doc, in UTF-16
[23:47:09] <rpav> wait what part is utf-16 then that's actually exposed
[23:47:18] <rpav> D:
[23:47:29] <rpav> like, byte offsets?
[23:47:34] <wasamasa> yup
[23:47:37] <technomancy> byte offsets would make too much sense my dude
[23:47:38] <rpav> sheesh
[23:48:10] <wasamasa> if you ever work with windows APIs, you'll see that there's UTF-16 and ASCII variants
[23:48:15] <rpav> well there shouldn't be much of a difference in _character_ offset between utf-8/utf-16?
[23:48:19] <natter> let's just round-trip it through UTF-8/UTF-16/UTF-8 to be on the safe side of things
[23:48:25] <wasamasa> there's also some API calls to pretend UTF-8 text is UTF-16
[23:48:30] <wasamasa> so that may be why they chose that design
[23:49:06] <quotemstr> GC got a pretty good reception
[23:49:15] <quotemstr> technomancy: Wat
[23:49:26] <technomancy> I love that I'm just never going to use LSP so I can just munch my popcorn and laugh my ass off at this
[23:49:37] <quotemstr> My position is that UTF-8 won, shut up, stop whining, and kill character encoding bugs forever
[23:49:46] <dustfinger> natter: I removed the with-editor.elc file and now it works. Thanks natter. Does removing that file cause other issues?
