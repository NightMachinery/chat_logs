[01:07:40] <pablomobile> Hi, probably this is a silly question, curl -n --create-dirs -T file ftp://some.server/dir1/dir2/ only shows a timer, didn't make any progress uploading the file, so I was thinking in use --quote to create the dir before, how can I do that? Or there's any trick to upload files when --create-dirs didn't work?

[16:51:45] <karel3d> hello
[16:52:40] <karel3d> I am debugging a weird thing. My tcp/IP stack is probably somehow f**d up... but I don't know how. When I do `curl --interface <interface> google.com`, it works. But when I do `curl --interface <IP address> google.com`, it does not.
[16:53:07] <karel3d> That IP address is what shows up in `ip addr show dev <interface>`
[16:53:28] <karel3d> It shows `inet <that IP address>/24`
[16:54:10] <karel3d> when I do `tcpdump` on that interface, I do see the requests with `curl --interface <interface>`, but now with the IP address.
[16:54:34] <karel3d> What can be wrong?
[16:54:38] <karel3d> And how to debug this/
[16:54:38] <karel3d> ?
[16:54:45] <StyXman> karel3d: IPs are not valid interface names
[16:54:49] <StyXman> maybe?
[16:54:52] <karel3d> They are
[16:54:54] <karel3d> :(
[16:55:14] <StyXman> well, how each program handles those parameters is independent
[16:55:32] <StyXman> the fact that tcpdump accepts it does not mean curl should too or viceversa
[16:56:08] <karel3d> ??? it says so in the manpage
[16:56:18] <karel3d> > Perform an operation using a specified interface. You can enter interface name, IP address or host name.
[16:56:21] <karel3d> https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html
[16:56:51] <StyXman> ah, hmmm
[16:57:08] <karel3d> so there is something wrong with my IP setup I _guess_
[16:57:12] <karel3d> no idea how to debug that though

[17:23:12] <bagder> that's unexpected, yes

[18:11:19] <karel3d> this seems like what I want
[18:11:33] <karel3d> anyway yeah it's a routing issue, not related to curl
[18:11:56] <karel3d> the thing is curl can use SO_BINDTODEVICE which somehow ... can route it through the interface anyway?
[18:12:04] <karel3d> not sure

[18:18:56] <karel3d> YEP I needed to add more than 1 routing table
[18:19:02] <karel3d> as described here
[18:19:03] <karel3d> https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/22770/two-interfaces-two-addresses-two-gateways/22794#22794
[18:19:08] <karel3d> annnd that made it work
[18:21:56] <karel3d> so it was a routing issue. thanks for help :D especially that strace thing
[18:21:58] <karel3d> I never used it before
[18:22:06] <karel3d> it is... useful!

[18:43:45] <jfuller> bagder: just so happens this is the week I meet real humans at redhat (after working there for a year) - just another way
[18:44:02] <jfuller> of saying getting to the curl docker release (albeit slowly) ... 
[18:44:16] <bagder> humans!
[18:44:18] <bagder> wow
[18:44:20] <bagder> =)
[18:44:41] <jfuller> I think this meeting people in the same spot might catch on

[18:47:05] <gevaerts> Meeting humans does have its advantages. It means you have to protect yourself against viruses, which means you have to have this high-alcohol hand gel around, which means that after I messed up this print thing and ended up with toner on my hands, the ideal way to clean that off again was readily available :)
[18:47:40] <bagder> \o/
[18:47:50] <Piru> office opened up around here. which means that office sauna was open as well. yay!
[18:47:58] <bagder> haha
[18:48:25] <bagder> I have an office sauna too, home office sauna! =)
[18:49:30] <Piru> I'm likely the other finn who doesn't have sauna at home. not even a shared one.
[18:50:03] <moparisthebest> I meet people in the same spot every day, it's called IRC
