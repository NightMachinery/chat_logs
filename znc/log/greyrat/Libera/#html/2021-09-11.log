[00:18:34] <apteryx> Hello!  I'm trying to prepend some text to an HTML blob (email text/html mime part);  Is it OK to prepend a full <html>...</html> block?
[00:19:33] <apteryx> The Python library I'm using seems to get confused after doing so, when using the email.EmailMessage.get_body('html') procedure (it returns None instead of the modified text/html part).
[00:20:29] <Pilum> Understandably.
[00:21:05] <apteryx> Could you mind to elaborate? 
[00:21:11] <apteryx> Could you please*
[00:22:24] <apteryx> it's not valid HTML to have multiple HTML blocks in serial?  So I should parse it and insert my text in the body tag for example?
[00:22:58] <Pilum> Yes.
[00:23:08] <apteryx> OK, thanks.
[00:23:50] <Pilum> Granted, HTML mails is a steaming pile of mess, but having multiple html elements in the same document would be a bit too much.
[00:24:08] <apteryx> hehe, funnily most email clients seemed to cope with it
[00:24:16] <apteryx> well, I tried two myself.
[00:25:18] <Pilum> A large component of HTML engines is attempting to handle invalid HTML because so many people just don't care.
[00:27:42] <lilmonkey``> (And also because in the past the standards didn't specify parsing rules very well (or at all, really :))
[00:28:07] <Pilum> True.
[01:22:15] <nbjoerg> apteryx: parse it using beautifulsoup
[01:22:22] <nbjoerg> apteryx: and do proper dom manipulation

[05:41:49] <apteryx> that's what I realize I should have done earlier.  Every time I'm tricked into using parser.html.HTMLParser (Python's builtin solution), I realize later that it doesn't cut it.
[05:42:48] <apteryx> with HTMLParser I was able to get the position of the start of the tag, which is nice but what I want is the 1+ the position of the closing bracket of that tag.
[05:43:12] <apteryx> I could perhaps scan the source string for the next '>' but I'm not sure if that'd be robust?

[05:56:59] <apteryx> seems to work 
[05:57:30] <apteryx> would it be legal to encounter a '>' among the attributes of a body tag?
[06:40:45] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[07:22:37] <apteryx> actually html email doesn't seem to care about a leading extra <html> .... </html> block.  Strange.
[07:23:14] <apteryx> I'm not sure if the valid HTML is worth the added complexity in my case
[07:30:15] <apteryx> and it has the benefit of 'winning' over broken HTML that already use multiple body tags (my parser chooses the last one, which inserts my fragment *after* the first text of such broken HTML).

[22:19:13] <DPA> Shouldn't the multipart format already handle composing parts of varying formats to be displayed sequentially? Mime multipart/mixed vs. multipart/alternative. There are some other ones too. And they should be nestable to some extent too, I think.
