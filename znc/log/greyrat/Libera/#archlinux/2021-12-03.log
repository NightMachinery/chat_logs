[00:57:47] <currybullen> J_Darnley: i asked a similar question over at #systemd recently. the journal is designed to be tamper-proof so it's not possible to just remove a subset of lines like that
[00:58:21] <thurstylark> there's not much out there on *editing* the journal, and imo it's because anyone who really cares about keeping old journal contents wouldn't want to or wouldn't be allowed to edit them
[00:58:36] <currybullen> J_Darnley: you will probably need to vacuum all journal entries from the beginning up until and including those lines

[02:58:23] <moonshine> i would just say, sudo covers a lot of function that most people don't need and will never use. it's probably more a question of doas being a more sane default, not doas replacing sudo for everything.

[04:51:09] <noahmg123> I found a bug in Google Chrome that only happens when running on Wayland (using the OzonePlatform option) on GNOME. It runs into an issue with the Mutter window manager. Where should I report the bug?
[04:51:20] <Dan39> def not here
[04:51:52] <Dan39> noahmg123: did you try to reproduce it with any other programs?
[04:51:52] <Namarrgon> check the AUR comments, then chrome's bugtracker
[04:52:26] <noahmg123> Dan39: yeah, chromium, and was able to reproduce there
[04:52:40] <Dan39> LOL
[04:52:45] <Dan39> thanks. that solves it then
[04:52:48] <Dan39> -_-
[04:54:08] <noahmg123> yeah, wasn't sure if I should report it to GNOME and/or Mutter, but Chrome bug tracker does seem like the best choice
[04:54:41] <topcat001> noahmg123: It's good to try with a new user, in order to be sure.
[04:55:02] <topcat001> Ideally even a fresh install (in a VM).
[04:55:05] <jmariondev> chrome bug tracker would at least be the one to tell you it's a GNOME problem instead
[04:55:37] <noahmg123> topcat001: well I tried it with and without the flags that make chome run natively on wayland and those appear to be the deciding factor

[05:10:50] <Dan39> 20:32 <noahmg123> essentially, when using a keyboard shortcut to try to open a DevTools window that's already open, if the browser is running natively on Wayland, that will run up against Mutter's focus-stealing blocker
[05:11:00] <kevr> noahmg123: and what the hell is Mutter's focus-stealing blocker?
[05:11:04] <kevr> what does that do
[05:11:19] * kevr shall try it on sway momentarily
[05:11:20] <Dan39> sorry
[05:11:29] <Dan39> want me to try it on X11?
[05:11:40] <jmariondev> does not allow a window to force itself into focus
[05:11:55] <kevr> like
[05:12:03] <kevr> after you press the hotkey, from then on it wont let you get focus on other windows?
[05:12:04] <jmariondev> i just tested and i too can replicate with firefox on GNOME 41 (under wayland ofc)

[05:12:08] <topcat001> well if Sway does not block focus stealing then it will probably not have the bug :) QED

[05:12:21] <noahmg123> kevr: yw
[05:12:38] <Dan39> sounds like a feature
[05:12:46] <Dan39> like, prevent programs from creating pop-up spam
[05:13:09] <noahmg123> "Usually it means that an app tried to raise a window, but was denied by mutter's focus-stealing prevention heuristics. The most common reason is that the app either passes an event time of 0, or one that is older than the most recent user interaction."
[05:13:23] <Dan39> would be nice to have some rules you can set, like "allow google-chrome to pop-up dev tools"? :P
[05:13:27] <topcat001> can the heuristics be configured?
[05:13:34] <Dan39> heaurisitics! yes!!
[05:13:34] <kevr> uhhh
[05:13:52] * topcat001 scared of that word
[05:14:02] <Dan39> it's like AI
[05:14:08] <Dan39> its just a big chain of if-elses
[05:14:13] <noahmg123> Dan39: firefox seems to have the same issue
[05:14:15] <kevr> ah i see
[05:14:18] <kevr> okay
[05:14:23] <kevr> i can test this with softu2f i guess
[05:14:24] <Dan39> that was joke, i have no idea
[05:14:31] <kevr> yes, it works on sway fine

[07:42:45] <icar> I have some journals with 200.000+ lines, some opcode errors on shutdown spammed. Wanna debug that? Lol
[07:43:33] <kevr> destroy your journals, reboot, reproduce it, then share the smaller journal after it has been reproduced
[07:43:47] <kevr> you can also just use uh
[07:43:51] <kevr> -b 0 i think, for the current boot
[07:44:01] <keir> just -b
[07:44:08] <kevr> right on ^

[07:45:41] <icar> Had it saved in Telegram
[07:46:05] <kevr> that's for the most recent boot
[07:46:20] <kevr> im thinking your log is gigantic because you didn't reboot for quite a while and a lot happened, then you did and encountered the issue
[07:46:36] <icar> Nah, I reboot at least once a day
[07:46:39] <kevr> so, perhaps just get it to happen on a fresh boot, take the journal immediately
[07:47:09] <kevr> well, that's a pretty big file

[07:50:22] <kevr> maybe tomorrow or whatevr, just ping me
[07:50:30] <kevr> though i gotta say off the bat: it's most likely a firmware issue
[07:50:45] <kevr> (since you mentioned opcode failures)
[07:51:58] <icar> I've had this laptop since 2019 and just recently it started behaving like this. If you say it's fw related, maybe some ucode update
[07:52:04] <kevr> if you don't have amd-ucode or intel-ucode installed for your particular processor, you might want to grab that

[07:54:08] <kevr> ah, okay.
[07:54:41] <kevr> well, frankly, i'm not sure this is really a fair thing to ask for help in here about; there are way too many moving parts, and most of us don't use testing on our daily drivers.

Also, I am confident most, if not all, of the Arch devs and OPs here also run testing.  AFAICT support for testing is not an issue :D
[08:10:41] <kevr> h4rd3n3D: actually, it is, because we've had to be following the testing package, and those change as issues are found. it's not the same as official packages at all.

[14:47:52] <elichai2> Hi, I have a package X that I compiled and installed manually on my system, but I want to install from pacman a package Y that depends on X, is it possible to install it without pacman also installing X? in other words, can I tell pacman that some package is already installed on my system? 
[14:48:22] <kayou> After an update I was unable to connect to arch, boot stopped I was able to switch to tty but no login worked (root or user), so I've sarted in single user mode and used passwd to change the passwords but it didn't change anything.As it seemed to be a problem with I've downgraded the package pam, but it was a bad idea after that my arch system
[14:48:22] <kayou> fails to start because of a kernel panic. So now I'm using arch-chroot to try to restore the system when I use pacmam -Suy, it fails because of existing files  https://x0.at/Ljlt.txt , I've also try --overwrite but it also fails
[14:48:22] <grawity> no (as in "Technically Yes But You Really Should Not")
[14:48:23] <Repentinus> grawity, could be some sort of an interference issue? Take a few steps back. XD
[14:48:32] *** Quits: LordRishav (~LordRisha@user/lordrishav) (Quit: Ight Imma Head out)
[14:48:41] <grawity> ideally you should make a PKGBUILD that compiles the package X
[14:49:21] <grawity> but if you really don't want to do that, then it depends on whether X is a customized version of a repo package, or whether it's something entirely custom
[14:49:23] <Repentinus> elichai2, why aren't you installing X from the repos in the first place? If Y depends on X, there's a good chance X is in the repos.
[14:49:47] *** Joins: Szadek (~Szadek@193.32.249.137)

Are the repositories secure or am I safe with the core, extra and community repositories?

[17:41:43] <MacGyver> Because even though there might be some regressions from time to time, you do need a new kernel for hardware support in the first place.
[17:41:45] <xecuter> MrElendig: as like as : GLib-GObject: g_object_unref: assertion 'G_IS_OBJECT (object)' failed

[18:44:52] <Varg> it was like a exchange for compile time and performance speed, you compile to exchange performance speed later, but at the end you lose time

[18:46:12] <ishitatsuyuki> that point is such a troll ;(
[18:46:15] <MacGyver> ishitatsuyuki: CPU extensions were much more fragmented in x86-land.
[18:46:22] <Varg> optimazion during compile with flags? 
[18:46:33] <Varg> and you can activate every cpu extension
[18:46:33] <GuiToris> Varg, did you also use genkernel?
[18:46:37] <MacGyver> ishitatsuyuki: The idea was that it was possible to use all the available optimizations (both from the compiler and the CPU).
[18:46:37] <Varg> no
[18:46:42] <Varg> i used the distro kernel
[18:46:43] <SysGhost> ishitatsuyuki: as one could tailor the compile flags very specifically for the CPU one had. That in turn gave some benefits in the end.
[18:46:45] <MacGyver> ishitatsuyuki: And to be fair to that idea, it *did* matter.
[18:47:01] <MacGyver> The thing is, that tradeoff isn't worth it if you then spend 2 days compiling gnome every update.
[18:47:25] <GuiToris> I quite agree
[18:47:25] <Varg> yes, but now it makes a different if a app has cpu extensions compiled or not
[18:47:27] <ishitatsuyuki> yeah, it should be obvious in the first place that compile time > time saved 
[18:47:37] <demonicmaniac1> look at the difference between i386 i486 i586 i686, that was considerable
[18:47:50] <Varg> you can also compile beside you work on the system
[18:47:55] <demonicmaniac1> also a bigger factor most often forgotten is that useflags meant you saved space - lots of space

[18:51:46] <MacGyver> SysGhost: Right, so my point is that back when disk space and CPU time were expensive commodities and there was so much difference between CPUs, all this tailoring to the system made sense.

[19:26:40] <thurstylark> my google-fu is failing me... looking for a regex that matches a specific string if a specific character is in any position or missing. if the string is "foobar", that string should match, as well as "foo.bar" and "fo.obar" and "f.o.o.b.a.r"
[19:26:53] <thurstylark> pretty sure I'm just phrasing my search in a stupid way :P

[22:35:26] <SysGhost> Once that has been confirmed working, it's likely to be something in the air that disrupts the wifi signal.
[22:37:09] <SysGhost> ...and avoid using the 2.4 Ghz band. settle isntead for 5 GHz if possible.
[22:37:22] <snek> ironically the ethernet adapter i have is also broken
[22:37:27] <snek> or unfortunately i guess
[22:37:34] <snek> the wifi is 5ghz though

[22:39:45] <snek> when it goes down, no
[22:39:47] <mpan> The description is not clear, if “host unreachable” comes from the router or your own machine.
[22:40:13] <snek> its like the routes drop except the kernel still has the routes
[22:40:18] <snek> and nmcli says there's a connection
[22:40:23] <snek> very confusing
[22:40:52] <mpan> Can you confirm with something like Wireshark, what’s happening on the interface while sending a single ping?

[22:41:34] <mpan> Also, like SysGhost said, try 5GHz. Less likely to see interference.
[22:41:51] <snek> it is 5ghz
[22:41:54] <snek> wireshark is an interesting idea
