[00:00:18] <LordKalma> PJBoy, the .net VM is half JIT half interpreter... Some (quite good) heuristics make native code whenever it's "worth it"
[00:00:56] <LordKalma> python's @property decorators are only good to make my_foo.thing magically work with functions
[00:01:18] <LordKalma> for example a computed value accessed as variables
[00:01:34] <PJBoy> yeah I've seen it
[00:02:44] <LordKalma> I keep talking about a language that I used for 2 hours that I haven't decided if I like or hate
[00:03:01] * imMute love-hates C#.
[00:03:24] <PJBoy> I need more time with C#
[00:03:43] <LordKalma> meh, in one hand, I really would like to write my next project in C++. On the other hand... the .net ecosystem is looking sexy, even for speedy stuff
[00:03:44] <LordKalma> so idk
[00:03:48] <LordKalma> yeah, I have to use more too
[00:03:52] <PJBoy> but I'm completely depressed in a C# oriented way
[00:03:59] <LordKalma> !grab PJBoy
[00:03:59] <nolyc> LordKalma: The operation succeeded.
[00:04:22] <Alipha> if i want to be productive and it doesn't matter what language, i'd pick C#.
[00:04:40] <LordKalma> it's a daunting barrier to entry
[00:04:46] <LordKalma> the stdlibrary and stuff
[00:05:04] <PJBoy> C# has a shitload of language features to learn
[00:05:11] <LordKalma> yap
[00:05:16] <PJBoy> I dare say more than any other language ever made
[00:05:24] <LordKalma> laughs in JS?
[00:05:32] <PJBoy> JS has like 2 features
[00:05:46] <Alipha> c++ is a more complex language to learn than c#
[00:05:50] <PJBoy> associative arrays
[00:05:52] <PJBoy> and semicolon insertion
[00:06:12] <imMute> and lack of integers.
[00:06:15] <LordKalma> `this` shenanigans
[00:06:26] <LordKalma> and ... expansion (ES6 iirc)
[00:06:28] <imMute> oh fuck that too.
[00:06:32] <PJBoy> the this video I saw made them seem fine
[00:06:43] <imMute> "this" shenanigans are a bitch when you find out about them unexpectedly
[00:07:00] <kalven> js had async/await way before c++ (and in a usable form)
[00:07:11] <Alipha> my toy scripting language i started has closures...
[00:07:19] <LordKalma> I'm using Vue.js 3 and Vue actually injects this so that it always does the right thing
[00:07:29] <LordKalma> which is a godsend
[00:07:44] <PJBoy> jesus christ does that sound like a hack
[00:08:22] <PJBoy> I haven't seen any JS async/await code yet
[00:08:26] <imMute> JS is a hack.
[00:08:32] <LordKalma> for example https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-setup.html#usage-of-this
[00:08:43] <LordKalma> PJBoy, whaaat??! all JS devs write is .then()
[00:08:49] <PJBoy> I usually see those chained "(...).then()" stuff
[00:08:55] <PJBoy> yeah exactly
[00:09:02] <PJBoy> but that's synchronous stuff
[00:09:09] <LordKalma> JS devs love callback hells
[00:09:34] <PJBoy> callbacks make sense
[00:09:42] <PJBoy> I'm completely fine with callbacks
[00:10:24] <LordKalma> I was trying a vue-based framework, but ended up going back to the basics, and now I'm trying to learn tailwind instead of bootstrap
[00:10:36] <PJBoy> python is the language that's exposed me to async/await stuff the most
[00:10:50] <PJBoy> and I've dabbled with it in C#
[00:10:51] <LordKalma> and that came in 3.6 iirc
[00:11:04] <LordKalma> or was async def in 3.6?
[00:11:30] <PJBoy> idk that's ancient history
[00:11:39] <LordKalma> I learned python in 3.3 hahah
[00:11:50] <kalven> async/await is the way out of callback hell
[00:11:50] <LordKalma> and the ecosystem was still all on 2.7
[00:11:53] <LordKalma> namely numpy
[00:11:58] <PJBoy> I learned python back in 2010
[00:12:16] <rpav> commit first, _then_ refactor
[00:12:26] <LordKalma> ^that
[00:12:36] <LordKalma> PJBoy, 2012 for me
[00:12:45] <PJBoy> which was 3.1
[00:13:16] <PJBoy> I never did get a grasp on how the async stuff worked though
[00:13:32] <PJBoy> something complains that I don't use await and I added it in
[00:13:46] <PJBoy> seemed pretty redundant

[00:49:21] <aegon> but if both are wrong together, and they only talk with eachother, are they wrong?
[00:50:14] <LordKalma> if a function has total public test coverage and all units test pass, but there is a bug, is there one really? :p

[00:51:08] <LordKalma> with the exception of leak-type of bugs, asan and etc, I'm a fan of black box testing
[00:51:46] <Alipha> i wouldn't call UUID generation "rolling your own crypto"
[00:51:49] <rpav> is it really total public coverage if it doesn't cause all code paths to be exercised, and yet they're reachable?
[00:52:08] <LordKalma> you can have mutually canceling bugs
[00:53:01] <rpav> i guess it would only have a hypothetical future impact
[00:54:18] <LordKalma> as long as you don't #define private public
[00:55:01] <rpav> well, i mean if you add or modify something later, you'll potentially run into the individual non-canceling buggy behavior
[00:55:16] <LordKalma> then future tests ought to catch is
[00:55:27] <LordKalma> the bug only happens then
[00:55:40] <rpav> right, it's more a matter of "how soon do you catch this and is it important to catch sooner than later"

[00:55:58] <rpav> it may be better to know about sooner, at least, but
[00:56:12] <LordKalma> arguably, if you have small enough code blocks that's not even a question?
[00:56:54] <rpav> not necessarily, i mean, imagine you've implemented something you think is a general solution, but the general solution is actually _hard_, but it does work for your specific case

[01:40:30] <sord937> to me it seems wrong and better to build the shared library per distro
[01:41:08] <ashafq> Alipha: And the `const float **` is a nice way of saying "We don't touch this buffer" in C/ASM land
[01:41:10] <rpav> sord937: usually not, though _maybe_ if you use appimage or something
[01:41:37] <rpav>  i'm not sure how appimage gets around licensing issues though
[01:44:17] <rpav> (actually the runtime exception _may_ be sufficient for those, but i'm not sure)
[01:45:00] <sord937> rpav: yes I think the licensing is covered, it is just the "single package including system libs for all distros" that I am uneasy about
[01:45:25] <rpav> https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gcc-exception-3.1-faq.en.html see "I use a proprietary compiler..." 2nd para
[01:46:06] <sord937> the problem with it is that users will link against this library and use unexpected "system" libraries like libstdc++.so/libgcc_s.so/etc from some other source
[01:46:07] <rpav> sord937: it's not necessarily bad, and if you're doing binary dist might be a really good choice, because binary library compatibility can be pretty finnicky especially across versions
[01:46:26] <rpav> and assuming everything has the same version available across distros is .. probably not a good assumption ;)
[01:46:53] <rpav> https://appimage.org/ <- if you haven't considered that, perhaps check it out

[01:47:21] <sord937> rpav: thank you
[01:47:27] <rpav> (of course if it would make more sense to get your thing included in distros as distro packages, that's different)
[01:48:17] <sord937> it is not mine actually, someone provided it and to my surprise my app linked against it and ended up using their libstdc++.so which I quite dislike :-)
[01:48:58] <rpav> yeah if it doesn't it's not like C where it's probably fine; you can run into all sorts of ODR violations and binary incompatibility
[01:49:26] <rpav> well, hypothetically .. gnu stuff tends to have all the versioned symbols so that may all work fine nowadays
[01:49:35] <Alipha> aegon: literal integers, unless you specify otherwise, are of type `int`.
[01:49:39] <sord937> yeah - I think I will try to explain that to them - they want to have a single package (tar file) for a number of distros
[01:50:03] <rpav> ULL
[01:50:09] <sord937> rpav: you are right - it works because of that

[01:59:23] <johnny> aha
[01:59:59] <johnny> well my problem is actually in a C# application (unity) that interfaces with windows dlls, so this didn't seem to be the place for it
[02:00:13] <johnny> I'm not making a game tho :)
[02:01:01] <Alipha> johnny: ah, so one of the above channels, or possibly there's a #unity and #c# or #csharp channel?
[02:01:31] <johnny> i did ask on unity, but the question is about hte usage of the win32 api itself which seems too specific for most of the people there to be able to answer
[02:02:18] <johnny> and C# doesn't seem to be the right place either, since i'm asking about the proper usage of the win32 apis themselves, not the C# incantations to achieve them
[02:02:56] <johnny> winapi doesn't seem to be the right place either based on the topic sadly
[02:03:09] <aegon> except for #unity is not the engine
[02:03:27] <johnny> it's #unity3d , but i just imagine Alipha didn't know the specific channel
[02:03:27] <aegon> not sure what it is but i end up there every once in a while and am super confused about whats going on

[02:06:59] <johnny> the apis currently in use have existed since freakin windows 2000 even via user32

[06:20:40] <sprout_> is there a manner to portably create flexible objects of a class?  (classes which end with a `type[] m`member)?
[06:21:45] <sprout_> or,  conversely is there a manner that _I_ can pass a pointer with the memory location where an object should be created to `new`?

[06:24:01] <kalven> c++ doesn't have flexible array members. as for the second question, it sounds like you're asking for placement new
[06:26:25] <sprout_> let me state this differently.  I have a prototype interpreter for a language coded in 'ordinary' c++.  the runtime model is an object hierarchy of atoms or arrays of atoms.  I run into performance problems with the array of atoms.
[06:27:16] <sprout_> what I now have is a smart pointer to an array object which wraps a vector which probably allocates an array in turn... pretty hefty

[16:46:25] <mort> "Everything about the actual allocation details of bit fields within the class object" is implementation-defined
[16:46:41] <mort> I would expect it to be a legal implementation to use one int per bit

[16:51:10] <RandomReader> which leaves multi-bit fields, and since even the basic arithmetic is implementation-defined, usually the reason for using them involves layout desires

[17:29:04] <udet> hi all, I've got a question to type polymorphism and runtime type informations. lets assume I have a void* and a type_info describing type referred by that void*. the type referred is defined like C: A, B. could I get a void* to the B part? (dynamic_cast needs to do this somehow, but I can't find out how)
[17:29:15] <aegon_w> yeah its in additional library dependencies as libzmq.lib
[17:29:44] <aegon_w> but it must be finding it, because if i change the name it gives an error about not finding the file
[17:30:12] <PJBoy> it is a big long template there
[17:30:26] <PJBoy> maybe you're instantiating a template with a type that the library hasn't accounted for
[17:30:27] <udet> so basically, how to use type_information system to get offset to a certain inheritaned type
[17:30:53] <aegon_w> this stuff compiles and runs on gcc / clang
[17:31:02] <aegon_w> is it possible its something specific to msvc?
[17:31:32] <PJBoy> it's *possible* yeah
[17:31:37] <aegon_w> i compiled on the other two targeting c++17
[17:32:02] <aegon_w> i only did latest on msvc because it said it needed it for using feild identifiers in initializers
[17:32:24] <aegon_w> and removing those everywhere makes the code way harder to read and they are literally like, everywhere
[17:32:55] <aegon_w> its so wierd that it compiled once. is there any sanity check i can do of the generated libzmq.lib file?

[17:36:52] <aegon_w> not sure if that will preclude me from getting it
[17:36:56] <PJBoy> doubt it

[17:37:57] <RandomReader> you can convert after that, but you can't do blind conversions from it alone, since it carries no information on what type it is originally (so there's no source for a conversion)
[17:38:21] <PJBoy> that's what the typo_info is supposedly for

[17:45:37] <PJBoy> etc for all possible types
[17:45:40] <RandomReader> the sender needs to supply a type the receiver already knows
[17:46:32] <rpav> udet: you probably have a bigger problem in that typeinfo isn't very useful; can you change what you store (instead of typeinfo)?
[17:46:36] <PJBoy> aegon_w, what library was this again?
[17:46:39] <RandomReader> type_info is only useful for selecting among a set of types you already know
[17:46:46] <rpav> i.e. typeinfo isn't reliable across TUs and it doesn't do much else
[17:46:54] <RandomReader> or simply storing it for the sender to look at itself
[17:47:27] <aegon_w> https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq
[17:47:30] <rpav> yeah if you can store actual other metadata about your class, you can do what you want, but you have to build a bit of infrastructure
[17:48:55] <udet> rpav, yes I can
[17:49:50] <PJBoy> aegon_w, is that the same as any of these? https://zeromq.org/get-started/?language=cpp#
[17:50:00] <udet> rpav, I have mor or less full controll. what I would like to avoid, but would do if really neccessary, would be to access compiler specific typeinfo stuff. however, at the moment my code supports only gcc
[17:50:01] <rpav> ok so i think you can't actually _query_ inherited types til like 20 or 23, but you can define your _own_ thing with like, my_type_info<C, Inherited...>
[17:50:21] <PJBoy> or are you using the C interface?
[17:51:10] <aegon_w> i'm using cppzmq to interface with it which is a header only wrapper around the libzmq  c library
[17:51:17] <PJBoy> alrighty
[17:51:33] <PJBoy> well cppzmq *is* available on vcpkg
[17:51:40] <aegon_w> its the same ones as on that site
[17:51:51] <udet> rpav, I thought of that, but I still do not see how to get the offset
[17:51:52] <rpav> udet: but then if you define such, you can make it do whatever you want, including query and/or cast to base classes
[17:51:54] <PJBoy> which could potentially make linking a shit tonne easier
[17:52:05] <aegon_w> i've never used that, maybe its the way to go, i've got the rest of this stuff configured through cmake
[17:52:28] <PJBoy> it does work best through CMake integration
[17:52:32] <PJBoy> so that's a plus
[17:52:36] <mort> ew
[17:53:18] <PJBoy> fact of that matter is not all vcpkg packages are MSBuild compatible
[17:53:40] <rpav> udet: C++ gets the offset; given a void* and a `mytypeinfo<C,...>`, make `mytypeinfo<C,...>::cast<B*>(void* ptr) { static_cast<B*>(reinterpret_cast<C*>(ptr)); }` or whatever
[17:54:18] <rpav> cast is a template of course and that ought to error if you _can't_ cast it
[17:54:52] <udet> mytypeinfo<C,...> still implies, that I have the type available. I could only pass a mytypeinfo.
[17:56:17] <rpav> right the way you do typeinfo is to have a `mytypeinfo` base, and a templated subclass
[17:56:18] <RandomReader> udet - if you have full control, why are you using void* at all?
[17:56:26] <udet> thats pretty much the catch, I have a void pointer where I "know"(if type is not it it shall nullptr) there is a certain type in, and I have everything I could transport as runtimeinformation.
[17:56:30] <rpav> ^ also what RandomReader said
[17:56:33] <RandomReader> just pass a useful type to begin with
[17:57:14] <rpav> even if you have some kind of `any` you shouldn't have a void*
[17:57:17] <aegon_w> should i be extra careful to build the lib and the main project with the same c++ standard target?
[17:58:44] <PJBoy> from what I understand, the main project C++ standard should be >= the lib's
[17:58:49] <udet> rpav, RandomReader give me a sec, I try something with any and godbolt. probably then I can better show my problem
[17:58:58] <rpav> e.g. i wrote an any_ptr that will "type-safely" store a pointer to any type, but it uses custom type info in this way .. you have a base class with virtuals and templated subclass, so when you _store_ it, you store a pointer to the templated subclass as the typeinfo base class
[17:59:01] <PJBoy> c++latest is questionable
[17:59:17] <rpav> if you want special casting stuff from the base, you need some type-as-value handling probably but it should be doable
[17:59:18] <PJBoy> but I think it should work personally
[17:59:28] <PJBoy> but c++20 really should work

[18:20:22] <rpav> what seems to be going on
[18:20:59] <udet> RandomReader, I don't see how shared_ptr's aliasing ctor shall do this trick
[18:21:23] <rpav> you're likely looking for a solution to your solution, rather than a solution to your problem
[18:21:24] <LordKalma> rpav, ignorance, mostly?

[18:22:09] <RandomReader> shared_ptr can store a pointer that is independent of the what it is owning
[18:22:24] <RandomReader> but I'm still not clear on why you think you can't use B* here

[18:24:26] <LordKalma> shared_ptr<Base> s(new Sub()); // ?
[18:24:32] <rpav> n-eww
[18:27:00] <RandomReader> the question was to completely erase, which is what I meant with the aliasing constructor, since you can pick any pointer value to store and still maintain ownership of the original
[18:27:35] <rpav> yeah that's what i thought you meant, the "store a pointer .. independent of what it is owning" struck me as different
[18:28:03] <udet> LordKalma, I already have a pointer and do not know thats of type Sub. just having a type_info or whatever I trasport at runtime from the place where I know it is of type Sub
[18:28:05] <RandomReader> but that value still needs meaning of course, and I haven't yet gotten any answer to why B* isn't the appropriate meaning

[18:28:28] <LordKalma> udet, that doesn't sound like particularly good code

[18:28:44] <RandomReader> what *problem* is this solving?
[18:29:26] <RandomReader> I mean we can go in circles talking about how the approach you're fixated on won't work, but it'd be more interesting to solve the real problem instead :P
[18:29:52] *** Quits: callq (~callq@157.41.67.21) (Quit: callq)
[18:31:18] <udet> LordKalma, Not a good code by common pattern, I agree. But I try to define a new kind of pattern which would create circular dependencies at compiletime if I do not manage to transport typeinformation at runtime. what for sure then does not work out at all. however, without supporting polymorphism this pattern works out well by using reinterpret_cast, type hashes and having the very same destination type as the source type was
[18:31:31] <udet> now I want to support polymorphism for obvious reasons
[18:31:44] <RandomReader> what circular dependency does this avoid?
[18:32:05] <RandomReader> both sides still need the type information
[18:32:42] <udet> yes, thats right. but the code inbetween does not
[18:33:15] <udet> source knows type - transport does not know - destination knows
[18:33:35] <RandomReader> sure, that's fine for void*, but it doesn't explain why you're using type_info at all, or what the point of the polymorphism is
[18:33:36] <udet> if transport code would know the type while code using transportcode defines the type...
[18:33:45] <RandomReader> or why you can't use a common type like B*
[18:34:04] <udet> RandomReader, know I'm not using type_info. That was an attempt to support polymorphism
[18:34:10] <udet> -k
[18:34:32] <RandomReader> you just said "without supporting polymorphism this pattern works out well by using reinterpret_cast, type hashes"
[18:34:43] <RandomReader> why type hashes?
[18:34:59] <udet> If I want to support polymorphism for this, I need to somehow get hand on the offset so I shift void* before I reinterpret_cast it
[18:35:10] <RandomReader> you shouldn't be reinterpret_casting anything at all
[18:35:19] <udet> type hashes to ensure, that I do not reinterpret_ast into problems
[18:35:32] <RandomReader> why would you since you have to use the same type on both sides?
[18:35:40] <RandomReader> again, what is the real problem being solved here?
[18:35:40] <udet> SrcT hash == DstT hash -> reinterpret_cast is ok
[18:35:50] <RandomReader> no, static_cast is ok
[18:35:55] <RandomReader> reinterpret_cast is inappropriate
[18:36:39] <udet> well... thats another discussion, but yes static_cast would work out here too, if there were not the thing with memory compatible containers....
[18:37:00] <RandomReader> there's no "if there were not" here
[18:37:07] <RandomReader> to use void* correctly, you static_cast to and from the same time
[18:37:13] <udet> which then need reinterpret_cast. does not matter, the problem at hand is, how to support polymorphism in this scenario
[18:37:13] <RandomReader> that's it, there is nothing else
[18:37:24] <RandomReader> same type*
[18:37:47] <RandomReader> you're still not describing the scenario
[18:37:49] <rpav> "if everything wants a B*, why are you not dealing in B*"
[18:37:58] <RandomReader> and I'm tired of asking, so I'm not participating in this conversation anymore
[18:38:00] <udet> you assume, that I tell all what is around, but thats not true. I try to break down the problem so a meaningful communication is possible in this chat
[18:38:42] <udet> so when I speak of void* in truth thats a pointer inside a templated container which is reinterpret_casted to its different flavours
[18:38:57] <rpav> the problem is you aren't describing your _problem_, you're describing your conceived _solution_, which does not appear to be particularly good
[18:39:01] <udet> and for transport it is casted to container<void>
[18:39:46] <udet> ok, so lets ask then the direct question. I transport a pointer from A to B while code transporting cannot know its type
[18:40:02] <rpav> be more specific about "A" to "B"

[18:41:55] <aegon_w> like can i look at the .lib to make sure that symbol is there :?
[18:42:44] <udet> I'm transporting it, because it has to go from a to be. it's kind of a lazy function call. It is called on A, but executed on B. the mechanism which stores the information of which function and its arguments is the transport code. it's a bit like std::function but has more powerful captures which are actually doing something (locking memory)
[18:43:19] <udet> not std::function, lambdas
[18:43:24] <rpav> continued nondescription of the problem and i'm just ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[18:43:27] <udet> and the capturing mechanism

[18:48:57] <aegon_w> maybe i should have started development on windows and moved to unix based systems later?
[18:49:08] <aegon_w> like this is all coded against the stdlib
[18:56:14] <aegon_w> huh, dumpbin /exports is empty
[18:56:33] <aegon_w> er it has, i don't know how to read it, not function names though
[19:00:37] <RandomReader> LangerJan - using the union is standard-UB (although many compilers support it as an extension), and the anonymous struct is also nonstandard .. but as an example in the different of layout when trying to treat the bitfield struct as a single value: https://godbolt.org/z/5ahcP91G1
[19:00:55] <RandomReader> this is essentially big endian vs little endian on powerpc64
[19:01:39] <RandomReader> I don't know if that's what you were going for .. using *either* the bitfields or the flags value, no union, would be fine
[19:03:06] *** Joins: mitch0 (~mitch@188-143-71-34.pool.digikabel.hu)
[19:05:10] <RandomReader> udet - that was the first thing I answered: not possible
[19:10:05] <udet> RandomReader, not possible is not true. at least using compiler internals it is possible. search for __do_upcast in gcc's libsupc++, it is doing exactly that
[19:10:21] <aegon_w> it cant even find the symbols using the one from vcpkg
[19:10:22] <udet> I just would like to have a generic way
[19:11:51] <RandomReader> udet - are you doing this on purpose?
[19:12:08] <udet> how said, dynamic_cast is doing that what I want to do. traversing class hierarch and getting the offsets
[19:12:15] <RandomReader> you asked whether it was possible without accessing compiler specific runtime internals, so I said no, and your response is "but you can, using compiler specific runtime internals!"
[19:12:42] <RandomReader> this is either one hell of a language barrier, or you're trolling
[19:13:02] <udet> purpose? no for sure not. but ok. you meant something else as I understood
[19:14:03] <ashafq> Is there a way to add symbols from a static library to another static library?
[19:14:03] <PJBoy> aegon_w, did you make sure to get the x64 library (if you're building 64-bit code)?
[19:14:23] <PJBoy> vcpkg requires a triplet argument for that
[19:14:23] <ashafq> I am using cmake so I was wondering if there was a portable way of doing this....
[19:15:29] <RandomReader> dynamic_cast is not a library feature, it's a core language feature that is implemented in some compiler-specific way .. it is unrelated to type_info
[19:16:04] <RandomReader> it is not possible to duplicate what it does within the scope of the standard language, since everything about it is compiler specific
[19:17:03] <RandomReader> type_info does not provide or represent any information about polymorphic relationships
[19:19:44] <rpav> trivially, to cast from some given C to a base B, you need to _compile and ship code_ that performs the `cast<C,B>(ptr)`, for all given C and B
[19:19:51] <RandomReader> the typeid operator is what finds the dynamic type (most derived) of a polymorphic object
