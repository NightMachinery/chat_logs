[15:34:26] <rqsd> What is "the cloud" in your case?
[15:35:55] <rqsd> Are they just a bunch of servers that you yourself control or is it some big cloud provider's managed service(s)?
[15:38:50] <thomas25> bunch of servers that i control myself
[15:39:27] <thomas25> what happens if my CA issuers is compromised. is CA revoked? how is this let known to clients?

[17:34:49] <MacGyver> thomas25: You don't.
[17:35:21] <MacGyver> thomas25: At some point you must root your trust somewhere. Even signed firmware upgrades have an issue still.
[17:35:58] <MacGyver> thomas25: I.e. if the signing key is compromised, you *must* push an update that pushes the *new* signing key into the device; but the attacker can do the same thing at that point.
[17:36:10] <MacGyver> thomas25: Because they can sign their malicious firmware as well.
[17:36:34] <MacGyver> thomas25: At that point, it becomes a matter of people verifying through multiple channels that what they get is a legitimate update.
[17:37:20] <MacGyver> thomas25: So you use TLS to get it from their website, hoping that their particular TLS root CA isn't compromised at the same time as their signing key.
[17:38:08] <MacGyver> thomas25: Afaik nothing exists that claims to 100% solve this issue; and I wouldn't be surprised if it is provably unsolvable.

[18:06:27] <thomas25> ok these points just confirmed what i was thinking. so thanks. 
[18:24:29] <TimMc> thomas25: My inclination would be to have a rotation mechanism for the root cert, requiring a signature by a key that is initially generated offline and then split between N parties for safekeeping.
[18:25:41] <TimMc> But also require physical access for that rotation, if you can.
[18:27:04] <TimMc> (This advice may or may not be coherent relative to your actual needs. But those are some ideas.)
[18:56:29] <ms7821> alternatively, pick two or three large incumbent CAs and install only their root certs
[18:56:40] <ms7821> because as previously mentioned, running a CA is *hard*
[18:56:51] <ms7821> despite what milesrout reckons

[23:10:36] <MacGyver> TimMc: How would such a rotation mechanism be different from signed firmware updates set up the same way?
[23:11:56] <TimMc> I guess it wouldn't. :-)

[23:12:21] <MacGyver> Ah, okay. Was wondering whether you had a particular setup in mind.
[23:12:54] <MacGyver> So then I'd say, if you're building that anyway, make it work for the firmware in its entirety, not just the root cert.
[23:13:17] <TimMc> I don't work with embedded, so I wasn't thinking about updates would normally happen.
