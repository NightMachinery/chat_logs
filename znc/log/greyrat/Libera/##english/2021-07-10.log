[05:18:05] <MuchoLoco> In a letter, when beginning with a greeting, it is standard to use "Dear Sirs and Madams". How would a gender neutral introduction look? "Dear Sirs, Madams and otherwise non-specifcied Human beings?" (that was just exaggerated for fun).

[05:31:38] <LuisP14> Dear nonAlien
[05:35:24] <CuriosTiger> That doesn't quite work.
[05:35:33] <CuriosTiger> I was classified as an alien by the US government for several decades.
[05:35:37] <ksft> "Hello" is good
[05:35:50] <LuisP14> hehe
[05:36:48] <LjL> but fun aside, i think if you're going to do away with antiquated notions of binary gender in letter greetings, you may as well do away with the antiquated, stylized greetings themselves, and just say "Hello" or whatever sounds nice
[05:37:09] <LjL> whether that meets you with appreciation, i do not know
[05:37:15] <CuriosTiger> I agree with LjL.
[05:37:27] <CuriosTiger> If you want something more formal, you might simply try "Greetings".
[05:37:33] <LuisP14> Dear Terrestrial :>
[05:39:51] <LjL> i don't send many actually *letters*, but when i send emails or similar, i personally have a bit of an (obsessive?) aversion with re-using the same wording, for fear of sounding mechanical, so sometimes i stare a lot at the screen thinking of what i could write that sounds new and different
[05:40:11] <LjL> but that's just an observation, i don't actually recommend obsessing on this
[05:41:28] <CuriosTiger> In emails, I usually forgo greetings altogether.
[05:41:38] <CuriosTiger> I also have a habit of signing my emails -Stian
[05:41:55] <CuriosTiger> that hyphen was a convention I picked up in the BBS days, although I have no logical reason to include it.
[05:42:06] <CuriosTiger> other than perhaps to subtly communicate that I've been using email since the 1980s?
[05:44:00] <LjL> skipping the greeting does also seem like a viable option. i'm sure one can sound nice and forthcoming in whatever they're writing even without a headline signalling their intention to be like that

[09:26:38] <pussipupu> I'm not a big fan of Disney
[09:28:31] <rindolf> it means "no worries" literally, but "no problem" idiomatically

[09:30:16] <rindolf> or some dialects at least
[09:32:35] <pussipupu> Interesting gender system in Swahili, and I would guess in Bantu languages in general
[09:32:52] <pussipupu> And not tied to “natural gender” so not problematic like many
[09:33:05] <pussipupu> Well, not problematic in that way
[09:34:00] <rindolf> pussipupu: i'm a fan of a lot of Disney films/tv shows/etc. not all, naturally

[09:40:03] <pussipupu> OK, to me the tie to “natural gender” and obligatory gendering of persons is the big problem
[09:40:43] <pussipupu> I'm not really bothered by linguistic gender simply as noun-classes(though it's not something I'd likely build into a language)
[09:44:01] <pussipupu> So to me German is no worse in that respect than say Latin or Hebrew or Spanish

[20:47:44] <AskerX> gnstaxo the story is that she lied to all the top ops and the ops unknowingly lied to the users and when the truth came to light, as it always does :)  , the ops and the users became angry that a single guy was claiming decades of hard work of many talented people, so they all resigned and established Libera
[20:48:36] <AskerX> gnstaxo you can read about it on Wikipedia page for Freenode and Libera.chat thats all I know, first I was suspicious but after I saw some famous ops resignation statements then I was like its gotta be the truth

[20:52:48] <AskerX> gnstaxo I doubt that she was successful though, but it seems that after that individual (he) got it from her (the op) yes it was about to be monetized, a network that is the result of the work of a community, that is what I have understood so far
[20:53:40] <xenial-user5> Okay, but I liked the biblical message. I went to two shops and was not anointed as king.
[20:53:47] <AskerX> but I doubt they could actually profit, from the network directly, perhaps the user inputs and unlawful IRC logging and so on nad htne monetize that information

[20:56:19] <gnstaxo> AskerX: the original op was a woman and sold freenode to somebody that is a man?
[20:57:16] <AskerX> gnstaxo yeap I didn't include their names but yes that is what I have gathered, and the details of the deal was kept hidden
[20:57:52] <AskerX> gnstaxo Also all I know is from the resignation letters and statements and the wiki article
[20:58:10] <AskerX> you might be safer to read them and arrive at your own conclusion with criticial thinking
[20:58:28] <gnstaxo> I never got familiar with Freenode's staff as I'm more of a new user (started using IRC in 2020 lol)
[20:59:13] <gnstaxo> AskerX: alright man, thanks for explaining me, I'll read about it
