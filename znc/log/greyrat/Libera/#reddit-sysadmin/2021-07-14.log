[12:45:56] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> think of it this way
[12:46:05] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> the board has to power up *first*
[12:46:08] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> in order to boot the bios
[12:46:29] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> and booting the BIOS means the CPU is powered up
[12:46:33] <sd> 05<b​radley> thats what i was thinking logically - like how could it know what to look for on the power cide
[12:46:36] <sd> 05<b​radley> without power...
[12:46:39] <sd> 05<b​radley> but idk
[12:46:40] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> the USB chip
[12:46:43] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> it's called USB-PD
[12:46:52] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> well, the power stuff in general
[12:47:13] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> the device/chip negotiate with the USB wall wart to say "hey, give me this voltage" or "how much power can you give me"
[12:47:42] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> so the usb chip receives power, then does that, then sends power to the rest of the board
[12:47:47] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> and the rest of the board starts going up
[12:47:51] <sd> 05<b​radley> the reason i think this might be related is: this bios reflash is all about a PERMANENT change to the logic of the board which says: when i get usb-c power - power on

[20:00:00] <DrZak> who knew she would take it seriously
[20:00:13] <mistiry> those things matter to people sometimes, but...why are you doing a complete reimage to update outlook? lol
[20:00:19] <DrZak> her notebook was reimaged lke 9 mths before, with the old image with office 2016
[20:00:31] <oxipital> yeah bitches love outlook themes
[20:00:36] <DrZak> coz the users are too dumb, they can reinstall stuff themselves, so any error or any upgrade == reimage
[20:00:46] <sd> 12<S​obia> Oh my... I'm so sorry
[20:00:46] <oxipital> why not deploy office

[20:00:57] <csws> it kills me
[20:01:08] <mistiry> maybe expecting the end users to upgrade office is part of the problem
[20:01:12] <mistiry> IT should be managing that
[20:01:29] <DrZak> tbh. this reimaging stuff is working fairly well actually
[20:01:34] <mistiry> updrading outlook should never require a reimage lol
[20:01:42] <DrZak> it cut the costs massively

[20:01:44] <oxipital> reimaging is awesome
[20:01:59] <csws> like login and do shit lol
[20:02:01] <oxipital> and admittedly deploying office is a job description in and of itself
[20:02:32] <DrZak> well, it's not just the outlook, its entire office, and with office dozens and dozens of apps (many times a stupid excel file with a macro) that have to be compatible and tested with that particular office version
[20:02:36] <sd> 08<c​ritamine> lmao
[20:02:43] <DrZak> soo, in the end they decided to simply forgo that shit
[20:02:46] <csws> lol
[20:02:54] <DrZak> and reimage the whole box if theres an upgrade
[20:02:57] <oxipital> that's some mission critical stuff then
[20:03:03] <DrZak> leave update to continue
[20:03:16] <csws> what happens if Dumb Bimbo stays on an old version hypothetically and eventually it's just not even supported?
[20:03:19] <oxipital> has the macro model changed enough to break stuff like that?
[20:03:22] <DrZak> so big versions dont change, but regular update works
[20:03:27] <csws> like do you recall all the machines to reimage in that case?
[20:03:40] <DrZak> csws: oh nothingm, there's refresh running continuously
[20:03:42] <DrZak> yea
[20:03:49] <DrZak> complete recall, reimage and done

[20:08:24] <DrZak> or replacement of hw faults
[20:08:29] <mistiry> you said it earlier, user had to drive 2 hours in to drop off a laptop for reimage to update her office
[20:08:30] <DrZak> thus, the time would be spent anyway

[20:10:47] <DrZak> well, one complaint, if you manage to fuck up your outlooks profile, you can really delete it, since onedrive will always get it back :DD
[20:11:00] <mistiry> there was zero expectation that we'd try to save data off a failed system. you should have saved it to onedrive if it was important.
[20:11:09] <DrZak> yea, this onedrive stuff is great, entire profile and home stuff in there
[20:11:16] <DrZak> no reason to worry anymore

[20:14:28] <DrZak> i would imagine it is the reason for this build approach, you get a fixed set of shit, similar to mac os x, very few deviations
[20:14:35] <DrZak> so the dumb users can screw it up
[20:14:54] <mistiry> DrZak: for 11k users, you guys should be looking into InTune and AutoPilot
[20:15:29] <mistiry> tie in Azure AD and Company Portal to provide a place for users to get software (VPN clients, PDF readers, whatever)
[20:15:41] <AnonymooseReddtr> ^^
[20:15:43] <AnonymooseReddtr> we did it for 100 users
[20:15:45] <AnonymooseReddtr> and its awesome
[20:15:45] <oxipital> i should probably start fucking with autopilot
[20:15:47] *** Joins: XV8 (~XV8@2601:5cb:c001:50:7147:4cd:941a:eeab)
[20:15:51] <oxipital> i guess mdt is on the way out
[20:15:57] <AnonymooseReddtr> oxipital took me about 1/2 day to setup 
[20:16:01] <mistiry> autopilot is good shit
[20:16:03] <AnonymooseReddtr> for a very simple setup
[20:16:07] <oxipital> well my issue is paying for it
[20:16:09] <mistiry> especially if your VAR pre-registers them for you
[20:16:14] <oxipital> i'm kind of neutered here
[20:16:20] <mistiry> literally drop ship new systems to users, never has to be touched by IT at all
[20:16:28] <oxipital> corporate is apparently using tanium and big fix
[20:16:30] <mistiry> and OOBE is great
[20:16:35] <oxipital> no idea what they're using for imaging
[20:16:35] <AnonymooseReddtr> mistiry yea
[20:16:47] <oxipital> wait
[20:16:47] <AnonymooseReddtr> i love the fact that the OOBE actually will enforce MFA
[20:16:51] <AnonymooseReddtr> or allow you to onboard passwordless
[20:17:02] <mistiry> just went thru it for my new job a few weeks back
[20:17:11] <AnonymooseReddtr> Assign device to user ship it to them "Hello Moose welcome to <Corporation>" 
[20:17:14] <oxipital> they have a prebuilt iso which you're supposed to throw on a usb mdt share
[20:17:24] <AnonymooseReddtr> mistiry yea
[20:17:29] <AnonymooseReddtr> i am super excited to get to use more of it
[20:17:45] <AnonymooseReddtr> my new role will be 100% focused on modern workplace stuff
[20:17:49] <mistiry> if its done right its quite nice
[20:17:52] <mistiry> for the end user too
[20:17:57] <mistiry> so its not just a benefit for IT
[20:18:02] <oxipital> if i stick around here i really want to turn this into a zero touch admin setup
[20:18:08] <oxipital> i never have to see the user
[20:18:18] <mistiry> its possible
[20:18:20] <oxipital> have my assitant lug hw failures
[20:18:22] <AnonymooseReddtr> mistiry yea
[20:18:28] <oxipital> you need authority to do it
[20:18:30] <AnonymooseReddtr> We sent out about a dozen new laptops 
[20:18:33] <oxipital> that's my weak point
[20:18:35] <AnonymooseReddtr> all with autopilot configured
[20:19:15] <mistiry> AnonymooseReddtr: see if your VAR can register them to autopilot for you, and then you dont even have to be involved in the process 
[20:19:23] <AnonymooseReddtr> mistiry oh they did
[20:19:27] <mistiry> very nice
[20:19:32] <oxipital> yeah like dell does
[20:19:33] <oxipital> or did
[20:19:41] <AnonymooseReddtr> because they are leases we needed to ship them to our office and then distribute
[20:19:46] <oxipital> i tried to get my boss back in the day to send a custom image to dell
[20:19:48] <AnonymooseReddtr> OOBE did everything 
[20:19:55] <oxipital> "noi i prefer to do it by hand"
[20:19:57] <AnonymooseReddtr> we're replacing a guy with autopilot
[20:20:11] <mistiry> AnonymooseReddtr: nice
[20:20:14] <AnonymooseReddtr> ya
[20:20:16] <AnonymooseReddtr> friday is my last day
[20:20:21] <DrZak> mistiry: yea autopilot is in progress now
[20:20:21] <oxipital> it seems like autopilot and intune would replace your entire sccm team
[20:20:32] <mistiry> ehh, not usually
[20:20:39] <mistiry> SCCM is still kind for servers
[20:20:42] <mistiry> king*
[20:20:42] <AnonymooseReddtr> ^
[20:20:43] <DrZak> intune + sccm hybird
[20:20:46] <AnonymooseReddtr> you can do sccm hybrid
[20:20:55] <AnonymooseReddtr> but again depends on how many devices etc.
[20:21:01] <AnonymooseReddtr> for my current org? we're cloud only
[20:21:01] <AnonymooseReddtr> so
[20:21:03] <DrZak> but im luckily just an exchange support kid
[20:21:05] <AnonymooseReddtr> no servers to manage
[20:21:05] <DrZak> so, meh
[20:21:17] <DrZak> you dont have any kind of local ad?
[20:21:17] <mistiry> AnonymooseReddtr: thats how my new place is
[20:21:45] <mistiry> if we do, they dont fall under my purview. im out of "classic" IT now
[20:21:53] <DrZak> no local file servers, sap crap, stupid third party apps coded in 2005, etc?
[20:22:21] <mistiry> well, shitty  apps sure, but they run on servers in TEH CLOUD
[20:22:37] <oxipital> why keep sccm around for servers?
[20:22:38] <DrZak> with answers from vendors like 'oh well, our app runs on win 2008 server, soo, i bet it will run on 2019 too'
[20:22:41] <mistiry> at least thus far, nothing i touch is physical except my workstation.
[20:23:14] <mistiry> oxipital: i dont, if that was @ me. thats not something i deal with in this role.
[20:23:43] <mistiry> im SRE now, needed to get away from "traditional" IT and so far, it was the right choice
[20:23:48] <mistiry> no more managing NOC teams
[20:24:01] * oxipital reads some dumb blog about it
[20:24:19] <oxipital> see i'd love to manage a help desk or noc
[20:24:26] <oxipital> just come in get the place humming

[20:26:58] <oxipital> i think thats what i want most, a change of pace
[20:27:14] <oxipital> either pay me less to sit at home and deal with lusers
[20:27:26] <oxipital> or pay me more, make me come in and not deal with lusers
[20:27:40] <mistiry> or pay more and sit at home tow ork
[20:27:49] <oxipital> well one can dream
[20:28:11] <oxipital> but i don't live in fancy places like y'all uppity folks
[20:28:39] <mistiry> it took me a bit to find it. it was a couple of months of resume sending before something opened up at a place a friend worked at and i got the chance to interview
[20:28:44] <mistiry> i dont live in a fancy place lol

[23:43:10] <mistiry> yep, i *could* just use the laptop but i have better stuff personally. so i just RDP to the laptop and work that way. 
[23:43:17] <sd> 15<s​mearley11> But I've only ever used VDI in addition to corporate resources, and actually have never deployed it as the sole computer for a person before. Everyone's been under the requirement to remote in from their corporate PC
[23:43:20] <mistiry> one monitor is work monitor, other monitor is personal PC
[23:44:01] <mistiry> and even that way, half the time I'm just in a PuTTY window in that RDP session. 
[23:44:14] <AnonymooseReddtr> mistiry i'd love that setup
[23:44:34] <AnonymooseReddtr> i'm kinda 50/50 between work laptop and personal desktop as it sits anyway
[23:44:40] <sd> 15<s​mearley11> It's great. And it's easy to leave work, since you can just close the window and be done
[23:44:59] <mistiry> AnonymooseReddtr: i used my personal PC a lot for last job. i refuse to do it for this one lol
[23:45:17] <mistiry> most i will do is login to the HR stuff to like view benefits or payroll, no actual work though
[23:45:18] <AnonymooseReddtr> mistiry yeah
[23:45:24] <AnonymooseReddtr> i'm not sure my new employer will allow it anyway
[23:45:25] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol
[23:45:35] <AnonymooseReddtr> I'll still use my personal homelab and stuff for labbing stuff
[23:45:42] <AnonymooseReddtr> but as far as actual work stuff likely not
[23:45:53] <AnonymooseReddtr> Friday can't come soon enough
[23:45:57] <AnonymooseReddtr> i have my exit interview tomorrow
[23:46:11] <mistiry> i have my windows laptop and it runs a fedora VM. thats all i need :)
[23:46:20] <mistiry> oh nice, just went thru that experience myself a few weeks ago
[23:46:31] <mistiry> have something else lined up?
[23:46:44] <AnonymooseReddtr> yessir
[23:46:49] <mistiry> thats the way to do it
[23:46:58] <mistiry> hopefully for more money and less stress
[23:47:03] <AnonymooseReddtr> hopefully!!
[23:47:05] <AnonymooseReddtr> more money yes
[23:47:07] <AnonymooseReddtr> less stress
[23:47:08] <AnonymooseReddtr> i dunno
[23:47:13] <AnonymooseReddtr> bigger shoes to fill for sure
[23:47:19] <AnonymooseReddtr> narrower scope role though
[23:47:26] <mistiry> i actually went "down" in regards to title
[23:47:36] <mistiry> i was manager of infra. engineering before, now just lowly SRE
[23:47:47] <mistiry> but yes, much narrower scope for me as well
[23:49:17] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Seems like everyone is trying to find a new job
[23:49:35] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Just got done with an interview and have another with a different company tomorrow.
[23:49:44] <mistiry> it is an employee's market right now
[23:49:49] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> But I'm not sure I want to get into healthcare IT
[23:49:52] <AnonymooseReddtr> ya
[23:49:55] <AnonymooseReddtr> i got a 35% raise
[23:49:57] <mistiry> even if you're mostly happy, cant hurt to look
[23:50:05] <mistiry> AnonymooseReddtr: yeah mine was a bit more than that even
[23:50:11] <mistiry> its a great time to find new work
[23:50:19] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Yea I got a "raise" with a promotion the ended up being like 7%
[23:50:25] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> hence my ass is gone
[23:50:38] <mistiry> i got ~40k/year more
[23:51:00] <mistiry> and 100% remote
[23:51:05] <sd> 15<s​mearley11> Healthcare IT is such a crapshoot. It depends entirely on how BIG the healthcare is
[23:51:19] <mistiry> my manager isnt even in this country (though company and HQ is)
[23:51:46] <AnonymooseReddtr> mistiry yeah 
[23:51:51] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> 26 hospitals and 75k employees, but it's devops
[23:52:04] <AnonymooseReddtr> mine worked out to be about 30k more straight up comp, then a car allowance, and other bennies
[23:52:19] <AnonymooseReddtr> car allowance because role is expected to visit customer sites, but no travel with covid
[23:52:50] <AnonymooseReddtr> retirement matching etc.
[23:52:50] <AnonymooseReddtr> so
[23:52:53] <AnonymooseReddtr> i'm happy
