[21:10:04] <isflavior> Hi guys! btw.. happy 2022
[21:10:27] <kwilczynski> Hi! Likewise!
[21:26:38] <isflavior> I'm trying to find a solution to simplify on-premise installations for a SaaS product
[21:27:07] <shad> isflavior: ansible _all the way_
[21:27:31] <shad> whenever in doubt: ansible
[21:28:14] <isflavior> Does that work well with Docker?
[21:28:28] <shad> yes, well, kinda
[21:28:40] <Joel> docker docker docker for on premise.
[21:28:53] <shad> that's how i use it. I have ansible roles that install Docker, then other roles that template docker-compose files
[21:28:58] <isflavior> Currently we have some Spring microservices running with Docker
[21:29:00] <Joel> with ansible you'll have to deal with all the distro edge cases
[21:29:17] <shad> But if I had to do it again, whenever talking Docker, i'd go kubernetes 
[21:29:38] <Joel> Provide your customers a docker image, and a well thought out readme
[21:30:57] <shad> isflavior: if kubernetes is an option, then make some Helm Charts / Kustomize package, these work wonders whenever you're talking containers
[21:31:22] <shad> If it ain't, well i like my solutions with Ansible and templated docker-compose files. Beats ssh and editing files by hand
[21:31:59] <isflavior> I thought about using K8s but found it "too complicated" for my customers
[21:32:15] <Joel> isflavior don't dictate how they run the container
[21:32:18] <Joel> simply provide them with one
[21:32:19] *** LiENUX is now known as LiENUS
[21:33:02] <Joel> your readme should have a brief description, a list of env vars, their default, if they are required to be set, and a description. it should also have a section discussing data storage, and logging.
[21:33:28] <Joel> include an example or two on running the container as well
[21:33:41] <isflavior> Jeol are you suggesting to merge my microservices into one "backend" container?
[21:34:05] <Joel> isflavior no.
[21:34:16] <shad> i mean, if you sell a SaaS that people want to self host themselves, let them do it themselves
[21:34:46] <Joel> this is pretty far out of the realm of being a #devops thing, though, imho.
[21:34:52] <Joel> It's all down to business requirements.
[21:35:25] <shad> if your solution is X containers that have to speak with each other, how they are started and configured ain't your problem once the docker images are delivered. Or, get paid to do it
[21:35:54] <shad> And if you get paid to do it, either do as asked by the client, or build something yourself, with a well made solution for container orchestration like k8s :D
[21:36:27] <Joel> isflavior I've had zero problems handing off docker containers for local pieces of a saas at several companies now
[21:36:38] <Joel> you're hard pressed to find anything more popular than docker for a lot of newer software
[21:38:12] <isflavior> My problem is our business requirements... i need to find a solution as simple as out "old product"
[21:38:50] <shad> do you get paid for installation on-prem and is k8s really out of the question ?
[21:39:29] <Joel> isflavior as I said, it's not really a #devops problem, it's all down to business req's :) which means, no one here can help you
[21:39:37] <shad> if not paid for installation on-prem then push images on a container registry and end of the story
[21:40:09] <shad> if paid && kubernetes_ok => kubernetes ; if paid && !kubernetes_ok => ansible
[21:40:15] <shad> that's how i'd see it
[21:41:53] <isflavior> Our partners are only used to run an .exe file. we are currently moving from a desktop solution to a cloud one
[21:42:37] <shad> do you know their ops guy ? 
[21:42:54] <Joel> isflavior and what do your business people say?
[21:44:23] <isflavior> this is absolutely a business problem, I was just trying to "validate" my solution with someone
[21:45:05] <shad> also, i don't get the "moving from a desktop solution to a cloud one" if you do, why do they want to deploy themselves ? sell a saas as a saas
[21:45:17] <shad> eg: manage deployment yourself and let your user consume your services
[21:47:16] <isflavior> I think it comes down to some of the big customers
[21:47:34] <Joel> business should ask big customers what they need.
[21:47:50] <Joel> or is 'X' acceptable
[21:48:24] <Dus10> yeah, I have a customer that wants us to help them setup a VM manually for them to test out their application that they currently host on-premises but now in Azure
[21:48:42] <Dus10> Uh, why not look for a way to automate the deployment then?
[21:48:49] <Dus10> they run it as a SaaS for their customers, though
[21:50:27] <Dus10> I started learning Go last week... it is a pretty nice language, so far
[21:50:34] <Dus10> like a simplified C
[21:51:03] <Dus10> I can understand why it is so popular
[21:51:35] <slaughter> Dus10 someone else posted this last week or something https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/bggYMbnL/signal-2021-12-29-134721.png
[21:51:52] <slaughter> I keep looking at it and laughing
[21:52:10] <Dus10> ha
[21:52:19] <Dus10> yeah, there are still some odd quirks about it
[21:52:27] <Dus10> I started picking it up from Nana's video
[21:52:49] <Dus10> however, I learned that while she is great at throwing together videos, she probably doesn't have much programming experience
[21:53:10] <Dus10> she recommended floating point as a type for currency
[21:53:17] <Dus10> which, that is a tell tale sign
[21:53:55] <Dus10> I nicely pointed out that using another type would probably be better and then linked to why...
[21:54:04] <Dus10> she deleted it
[21:54:08] <shad> slaughter: you get used to if err != nil {}, but yeah i would have liked it if go could throw exceptions like every sane programming lang
[21:54:11] <Dus10> so, she is a bit fragile, it appears
[21:54:48] <shad> but eh, we got generics last year, maybe this year we'll get exceptions
[21:54:51] <Dus10> it will probably get something like that before long...
[21:55:06] <Dus10> then it will be like every other programming language :)
[21:55:11] <Dus10> well, aside from javaScript
[21:57:43] <Dus10> I am going to write my own tool to do this visualization stuff for Terraform
[21:57:56] <Dus10> the other tools out there are kind of dumb in one way or another
[21:58:14] <Dus10> despite yielding a nice output
[21:58:28] <slaughter> Hey what's wrong with JS, the best language ever
[21:58:48] * Dus10 waiting for an indication of sarcasm
[22:00:37] <slaughter> Eh I legit love JS
[22:00:48] <slaughter> It deserves a lot of criticism but I really do love it
[22:00:50] <Deknos> Dus10, go is simplified C? wut? since when did have C complex slices and coroutines? the ONLY thing which is complex and complicated (and unmanageable tbh) of C are Pointers. Golang is a really cool language, but.. simplified?
[22:01:32] <Dus10> it is easier to get started with Go
[22:01:42] <Dus10> there is less ceremony
[22:02:52] <Dus10> slaughter: I have been doing JS since it was new... it was actually the first programming I learned back in 94/95
[22:03:15] <Dus10> it has some more practical stuff today than it did then... but it is a pretty bad language
[22:03:34] <Dus10> you can tell it was written by "self taught" for "self taught"
[22:03:36] <shad> Dus10: too bad it's the only language for web development :<
[22:03:45] <Dus10> there is a lot of value in formal CS
[22:03:54] <Dus10> there is WebAssembly now, shad
[22:04:08] <Dus10> so you could theoretically use any language that can compile to WebAssembly
[22:04:21] <Dus10> like C#, even, with Blazor
[22:04:31] <shad> Dus10: can it output html though ?
[22:04:41] <Dus10> yeah
[22:04:42] <Dus10> that is what WebAssembly is
[22:04:59] <Dus10> an engine that can interface with the DOM and is compiled, as well
[22:04:59] <shad> i'll have to dig a bit more in that, someday
[22:05:09] <Dus10> it is relatively new
[22:05:18] <Dus10> a couple of years now...
[22:05:27] <shad> ah
[22:05:38] <Dus10> seems like it is starting to gain traction
[22:05:46] <shad> is webassembly wide use happening at the same time IPv6 will ?
[22:05:49] <shad> :D
[22:05:49] <Dus10> all of the major browsers support it
[22:06:10] <slaughter> JS was written by self taught for self taught - in 7 days
[22:06:12] <slaughter> Or 10 days
[22:06:33] <slaughter> Whatever it was, it was bananas quick. And now it powers the whole web. Crazy
[22:06:45] <Dus10> I am self taught, as well, but I have spent a ton of time on the fundamentals that get covered in CS
[22:07:09] <slaughter> shad you can use basically anything you want and compile it down to JS. Or Webassembly. If you can't love JS for what it is, anyway
[22:07:13] <Deknos> uf, selftaught? the developer of js copied heavily from languages like lisp as far as i am aware, and languages like lisp come from a formal CS background more often
[22:07:18] <Deknos> do you have a citation for that?
[22:07:46] <kwilczynski> La la la.
[22:07:46] <Deknos> brendan eich is his name
[22:07:47] <Dus10> Deknos: why would I have a citation... it is literally an opinion
[22:07:53] <kwilczynski> Anyone in Germany? Berlin?
[22:08:46] <Deknos> this guy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich invented javascript. he has an degree in mathematics and computer science. that is not "self-taught".
[22:08:55] <kwilczynski> Deknos: C also has a bonus - aside of pointers and such... - it's called "undefined behaviour" :)
[22:08:59] <Deknos> and that's a fact, not an opinion. o_O
[22:09:12] <Dus10> Deknos: I don't care, bottom line
[22:09:23] <Dus10> and I am not literally saying it was written by self taught
[22:09:26] <kwilczynski> Oops. Are you folks upset with one another?
[22:09:33] <Dus10> I am saying that it seems that way from how crappy it is
[22:09:35] * kwilczynski hands everyone a lollipop
[22:09:40] <Dus10> seems like it
[22:09:47] <slaughter> I was thinking "self taught" as in "buhhhhhhhh there's no basis for what I'm doing better figure it out quick"
[22:10:12] <slaughter> Oh lol he's the CEO of Brave now? How'd I not know that
[22:10:16] <Dus10> Deknos seems to think that after I crapped on JavaScript, I crapped in his pantry or something? I dunno
[22:10:23] <Dus10> kind of silly to take that personally
[22:10:35] <Dus10> people are allowed to have opinions about things
[22:10:35] <Deknos> well, your opinons "seem" like armchair-philosophy o_O.. i do not like javascript,but back then was a VERY different time...
[22:10:53] <Dus10> what do you think an opinion is?
[22:10:58] <Deknos> i just think it is very easy to shit on someones other work like that
[22:11:10] <Dus10> it isn't like I am writing some paper on how "JavaScript is like a self taught toddler's language"
[22:13:01] <Deknos> well it seems also pretty popular to shit on javascript the last years. i just think i heard enough about people shitting on other people's work. i just read tptacek "opinion" on gpg/pgp and in this moment i just have enough on opionions. sorry. i just have my 5 crazy minutes.
[22:13:12] <Dus10> and my beef with JS is more recent than back in the day
[22:13:27] <Dus10> basically, it is mostly the JS community that I think is bad and less so the language
[22:13:50] <Dus10> this notion that you must use frameworks
[22:14:17] <Dus10> it really isn't very hard to do most all of the things that people seem to think can only happen in frameworks in plain JS
[22:15:02] <Dus10> they also get to be pretty toxic when you talk about avoiding frameworks
[22:15:47] <slaughter> They're just dealing with jQuery PTSD Dus10 
[22:16:08] * kwilczynski has physics degree ...
[22:16:10] <slaughter> If someone shook the idea of using jQuery regularly at me, I'd latch on to a framework defending viewpoint and never let go
[22:16:13] <Dus10> perhaps
[22:16:14] <kwilczynski> That makes me self-taught?
[22:16:37] <Dus10> kwilczynski: technically, everyone is self taught
[22:16:48] <Dus10> nobody can do the learning for you
[22:17:01] <kwilczynski> I need to correct that statement. I didn't completed the 5 years to get MSc.
[22:17:08] <Dus10> not until we get to be like "The Matrix" and jack in and learn kung fu
[22:17:13] <kwilczynski> Went to work and then did few years of CS and maths and then also quit. :)
[22:17:20] <kwilczynski> (actually, run out of money to pay for it :P)
[22:17:43] <Dus10> yeah, I have always had this sense of regret about not doing a CS degree
[22:17:59] <Dus10> but I have backfilled the stuff pretty well, over time
[22:18:09] <kwilczynski> The only thing my broken background helps me... is reading Wikipedia about some CS topics where it happens to have a proof in it :P
[22:18:35] <kwilczynski> Other than that.
[22:18:43] <kwilczynski> I won't be able to pass a Google interview :)
[22:18:45] <Dus10> there is a big failing in a lot of CS programs, it seems
[22:18:52] <kwilczynski> Since I don't know how to flip a tree or something.
[22:18:54] <Dus10> even if I look at Opencourseware and stuff
[22:19:06] <kwilczynski> (if I need to know, then I go to read about it on Wikipedia :P)
[22:19:12] <Dus10> they just jump into types like everyone knows about them already
[22:19:43] <Dus10> and intuitively, floating point seems like a good choice for currency...
[22:19:53] <kwilczynski> ;)
[22:19:57] <Dus10> but then what you learn it actually does... you find out otherwise
[22:20:55] <Dus10> and really, that type thing... it has a ton of ramifications to "ceremony" like I was referring to earlier
[22:20:56] <kwilczynski> Like... for example, someone would casually read IEEE 754 at their leisure? :)
[22:21:03] <kwilczynski> Is that what you mean? :)
[22:21:10] <Dus10> like... wtf... what is public static voice... blah
[22:21:14] <Dus10> kwilczynski: exactly
[22:21:19] <Dus10> er
[22:21:22] <Dus10> public static void...
[22:21:23] <kwilczynski> Hehe.

[22:22:11] <Dus10> if you truly learn the fundamentals of types, then all of this stuff that you are just told to do starts to make more sense
[22:22:24] <kwilczynski> I think before the IEEE paper, most folks need to look at 1's complement. :)
[22:22:28] <Dus10> but that comes back to understanding the fundamentals of hardware, too
[22:22:40] <Dus10> yeah, 1s complement is vital
[22:22:45] <kwilczynski> But I did too much embedded development... so I am biased.
[22:22:53] <Dus10> I remember reading about that the first time and trying to explain it to someone
[22:23:02] <Dus10> I didn't do a good job
[22:23:11] <Dus10> I had to read it a couple more times
[22:23:19] <kwilczynski> I would did a poor job too, probably :

[22:23:54] <Dus10> "Oh, so like they add a negative number to subtract?"
[22:24:02] <Dus10> "No... but it is something else..."
[22:24:20] <Dus10> "You like invert the bits and I think add 1 to the beginning?"
[22:24:21] <Dus10> I dunno
[22:24:33] <kwilczynski> This is why I recommend people play https://store.steampowered.com/app/375820/Human_Resource_Machine/
[22:24:34] <kwilczynski> :)
[22:24:50] <Dus10> oh cool, another work simulator game
[22:24:54] <Dus10> I might try it
[22:25:07] <Dus10> I haven't played Euro Truck Simulator in a while
[22:25:42] <kwilczynski> Dus10: When you "graduate" from Human Resource Machine.
[22:25:44] <kwilczynski> Then https://store.steampowered.com/app/792100/7_Billion_Humans/
[22:25:45] <kwilczynski> :)
[22:25:56] <kwilczynski> Great for teaching distributed systems, hehe.
[22:26:08] <Dus10> nice
[22:26:51] <kwilczynski> I have soft spot for this game studio. :)
[22:27:15] <kwilczynski> Back when they were called 2D Boys, I helped with Linux port (testing and such) of World of Goo.
[22:27:20] <Dus10> are you going to Berlin soon, or something?
[22:27:40] <kwilczynski> No.
[22:27:51] <kwilczynski> A company I know is hiring.
[22:28:23] <Dus10> have you found something that you like yet?

[22:29:18] <rawtaz> i really wish that the trailers on steam actually showed more of what youre going to do in the gameplay, than in e.g. https://store.steampowered.com/app/792100/7_Billion_Humans/
[22:29:35] <rawtaz> theres no way to know if that game is something that you'd have fun with by watching that trailer
[22:29:52] <kwilczynski> Oh you won't.
[22:30:13] <kwilczynski> It's painful and not for faint of heart.
[22:30:31] <kwilczynski> It's gruelling to get best score in every challenge.
[22:30:32] <kwilczynski> Hehe.
[22:30:42] <kwilczynski> I love it.
[22:30:43] <kwilczynski> :>

[22:31:18] <rawtaz> i might have bought it if i could just figure out what i would actually do in the game
[22:31:25] <rawtaz> but i guess theyre not interested in that
[22:31:41] <kwilczynski> Harsh. :/
[22:31:57] <Dus10> I am glad we don't have much productive to do at work for the next couple of weeks
[22:31:58] <Dus10> it is going to be hard to get back into the swing of things
[22:32:33] <rawtaz> looks programmy
[22:32:40] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: It is.
[22:32:52] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: its not though - that trailer hardly tells you anything about what youll actually do :P
[22:33:29] <kwilczynski> Resistance is futile. Buy the game. :P
[22:33:36] <rawtaz> hehe
[22:33:39] <kwilczynski> :>
[22:33:56] <rawtaz> shouldnt one have played the ones before it first?
[22:34:01] <rawtaz> this seems to be a follow-up
[22:34:15] <kwilczynski> Somewhat. The first one is definitely good introduction to the mechanics.

[22:36:04] <kwilczynski> There is also a fun AI ish ML ish game on Steam in the similar sort of theme.
[22:38:42] <rawtaz> this shows gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQvitsGiytw
[22:45:55] <rawtaz> looks fun. i wonder how much patience one has to actually play it beyond when you get what to do and how it works heh
