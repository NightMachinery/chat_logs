[00:06:47] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Carbfix was launched as a research project in 2007 after prodding by the then-president of Iceland, Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, who had been told by a local scientist that Iceland’s highly porous basalt could mineralize CO2 without creating any seismic problems. Dr. Grimsson consolidated his role as Orca’s “fairy godfather” shortly after ending his 20 years as
[00:06:47] <feepbot> president in 2016, when he was walking through the bar of a luxury hotel at that year’s COP meeting in Marrakesh. “I happened to overhear this American investor sitting at a table loudly boosting this new Swiss company that he said had the technology to pull carbon straight out of the air,” he recalled. “So I stopped and said ‘Hey, in Iceland we know how to turn that
[00:06:47] <feepbot> stuff into rock!’” He put Dr. Gebald together with Carbfix “and bingo, that was the missing link.”' https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/31/climate/is-carbon-capture-here.html

[00:39:10] <SDr> haha, since hungary is in SSC, some commentary on it:
[00:39:24] <SDr> | Unfortunately, someone leaked Viktor Orban the text of a private speech he'd given to a party conference, including such colorful turns of phrase like:
[00:39:24] <SDr> Obviously we have been lying our heads off for the last one-and-a-half, two years. It was quite clear that what we were saying wasn’t true...and, in the meantime, we have, by the way, been doing nothing for the past four years. Nothing. You can’t name me one single important government measure we can be proud of, apart from pulling the
[00:39:25] <SDr> government out of the shit again in the end.
[00:39:25] <SDr> We fucked up. Not just a little bit but totally. No other country in Europe has committed such stupidities as we have.
[00:39:53] <gwern> 'Jewish American journalistsJewish American social scientistsJewish American writers' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Brothers nooooo
[00:39:54] <Robomot> Joyce Brothers - Wikipedia (Joyce Diane Brothers (October 20, 1927 – May 13, 2013) was an American psychologist, television personality, advice columnist, and writer. She first became famous in 1955 for winning the top prize on the American game show The $64,000 Question. …)
[00:40:04] <SDr> ^^ so this, the "oszodi speech",   was the giant batsignal, which initiated the great exodus of 2007-2008, and _a_ prime reason why I've moved to London
[00:40:47] <SDr> |  Sometimes this contempt turned violent; Hungary has been conquered and occupied by Ottomans, Austrians, and Russians. The worst insult was the 1920 Treaty of Trianon, when the victorious Allied Powers stripped away 2/3s of Hungarian territory in retaliation for its WWI loss, the ceded land going primarily to Slovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia.
[00:40:48] <SDr> Hungarians have never forgotten this humiliation, but through the long Soviet occupation there wasn't much to do but let it fester.
[00:40:56] <pompolic> i was too young to be able to move out but i think i experienced it as a similar turning point
[00:41:58] <pompolic> i think it also galvanized the righty radicals but they quickly devolved into infighting
[00:42:02] <SDr> ^^ this sorta underplays on the fact that hungary have participated in ~5 wars in the past 150 years, and _lost every single one of them_. Like, a historically accurate recount of hungary's last ~100 years is that it has been raped, and pilaged by: the austrians, the russians, the germans, the russians again, and currently the EU
[00:42:33] <pompolic> sometimes i wonder if a culture can get PTSD
[00:42:41] <pompolic> that would explain some things
[00:42:48] <SDr> with every iteration taking every single precious out of the country; and EU's presently taking the only regenerating resource -human capital- on a systematic basis
[00:43:01] <SDr> pompolic, yes, cultural PTSD is a useful way of thinking about it
[00:43:06] <pompolic> \o/
[00:45:30] <SDr> | At one point, Orban replaced the Constitution entirely with a new version, which according to rumor one of his college chums wrote on an iPad during a train ride (for some reason, this is the part that gets to me - at least use parchment!) It got so bad that the EU Justice Commissioner complained that “the constitution is not a toy”.
[00:45:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Eh, it's not terrible, though yeah, not clear with they bother
[00:46:10] <gwern> since the linchpin is killing flash, maybe it's just supposed to evoke 'old internet'?
[00:46:11] <SDr> ^^ yeah, it literally starts with embracing st mary, and the general "christian values" in the first few paragraphs of the constitution. it's bad. it's really, historically, bad.
[00:46:44] <pompolic> spicy constitution
[00:47:11] <pompolic> i'm...fairly sure that some of it is literally virtue signalling
[00:47:29] <pompolic> s/literally/primarily
[00:47:42] <feep> > I don’t see any of that with Orban. Yeah, after learning that right-wing nationalism did well in focus groups, he became a right-wing nationalism; after learning that refugees did poorly in focus groups, he turned anti-refugee. But you can tell that if focus groups ever started saying nice things about Trotskyist international socialism he’d pivot in an instant.
[00:47:52] <feep> what I am hearing here is that orban is right-wing merkel
[00:48:07] <feep> more insecure, too
[00:48:42] <Dyo> yeah this sounds familiar. the we-did-nothing-for-x-years-lol part too.
[00:50:00] <Dyo> does hungary still have independent media?
[00:50:14] <Dyo> as in, mainstream
[00:51:01] <SDr> Dyo  telex is the focal point of what little remained of that

[00:52:11] <SDr> Dyo, if you scroll back a few months ago, I threw some analysis here: essentially, the independent news was index.hu ,which got bought out by political parties, putting pressure on the editing team; one day, _the entire editing team coordinatedly stood up, and quit_, and they've reincorporated as telex.hu   based on donations
[00:52:27] <SDr> so eg EU leaks against orban mostly gets leaked into hungarian press that way

[00:58:52] <pompolic> article about hir tv: https://rsf.org/en/news/one-hungarys-last-critical-media-outlets-taken-over-orban-allies
[00:58:53] <Robomot> One of Hungary’s last critical media outlets taken over by Orbán allies | RSF (Lajos Simicska, a former Orbán friend and now outspoken opponent, finally relinquished control of Hir TV on 1 August to Zsolt Nyerges, a businessman and Orbán ally who had acquired the media group that includes Hir TV on 5 July. It also includes a news website, a political weekly, a daily newspaper and radio station. …)
[00:58:56] <mst> feep: sounds like this one's from the right so presumably better insulted as 'soyclub' :D
[01:00:11] <gwern> but where do you put soy on a pizza
[01:00:16] <gwern> oh, tofu topping
[01:00:20] <SDr> | Part of Orban’s solution is the general conservative milieu - traditional gender roles, Catholic values, and the like (he is known for his belief that women should not be in Parliament because “[they] cannot endure the style of Hungarian politics…it’s built on continual character assassination”). But alongside that he’s instituted a
[01:00:20] <SDr> grab bag of other policies: did you know Hungarian women with more than three children don’t have to pay taxes? That if you have enough kids, the government repays your student loans? Plus Viktor Orban leads by example: he has five children (one of whom is, in true Orban family tradition, a professional footballer).
[01:01:27] <mst> I wonder if that'll have any long term effect on birth rates
[01:01:37] <mst> so many such interventions look like they might but then don't
[01:01:38] <SDr> ^^  so, it's a _very large_ bag. To give an example, in a country where a countryside house costs $~30K, my sis got $10K (iirc) from the gov by signing in that she'll take on at least 2 children
[01:01:53] <gwern> mst: heck, it doesn't particularly look like it's had *short term* effects
[01:02:25] <gwern> SDr: how long does she have to bear fruit in that agreement?
[01:02:29] <mst> gwern: my default hypothesis is this will be good for people who wanted that many kids anyway (which, fine by me, child support good) but fuck all otherwise
[01:02:46] <gwern> mst: yeah, that's the problem at the margin
[01:03:00] <gwern> just because people take your subsidy doesn't mean your subsidy had any causal effect
[01:03:02] <SDr> gwern, idk, I _think_ it's structured as a normal mortgage, with forgiveness kicking in as a function of childbirth
[01:03:21] <mst> .oO "ringing the cash register, Mama Maureen style"
[01:03:25] <gwern> reasonable. every monthly payment functions a little 'so how's the wombing going'
[01:03:45] <mst> wombing sounds like it should be the present participle of 'to wombat'
[01:03:50] <SDr> mst, that is _precisely_ how it's marketed "fuck for your wallet, get pregnant for your wallet"
[01:04:37] <SDr> probably the worst anti-emmigration policy of the entire country (haven't seen in the article), is that peeps now taking student loans (~90%+?  of all students to cover housing / food costs) can not leave the country until they've paid back their student loans (well into their 30s). 
[01:05:01] <gwern> what? wow
[01:05:06] <SDr> given this, and brexit, I genuinely do not know how I would bootstrap my exit process if I'd been back there now.
[01:05:10] <pompolic> watching my tax dollars go to this
[01:05:28] <pompolic> well, not dollars, but you get the idea
[01:05:51] <gwern> damn. that must be one hell of a discouragement to STEM students with prospects. "guess I can't go get hired by MANGA because I'm literally imprisoned by student loans"
[01:06:00] <gwern> and americans think their student loans are burdensome
[01:06:12] <mst> "I wanted to put a bullet between the eyes of every hungarian who wouldn't fuck to save their nationality"
[01:06:18] <SDr> like, ok, I can say just fuck 'em, get the loan, leave, then not pay, but like: go where, exactly?   germany? they fuck me in with languages. france? HAHAHA no. 
[01:06:22] <pompolic> SDr: fwiw, i got a tech job, worked for ~3 years for a financial runway, then started a business doing the same, and now i am slowly trickling myself out of the country
[01:06:43] <rmmh> SDr: wait what
[01:06:57] <SDr> pompolic, yeah, and how's your social gravity going?  remember it's not about getting to a place once, it's sticking there that's profitable
[01:07:01] <rmmh> SDr: british citizens can't emigrate if they have student loans?
[01:07:14] <rmmh> or hungarian
[01:07:16] <SDr> rmmh, hungarians
[01:07:27] <pompolic> that sounds like good advice, but what's "social gravity"?
[01:07:33] <SDr> rmmh, separately to that, brexit, meaning getting into the UK from hungary is.. problematic
[01:07:36] <adiabatic> mst: heh
[01:07:47] <pompolic> oh, finding a network at the destination i assume
[01:08:07] <pompolic> that part of bootstrapping started 10 years ago :D
[01:08:32] <SDr> pompolic, it's the pub you go down every weekend, it's the vibing you do with friends, and the girlfriend you have on the side.  all that stuff gets basically reset() to null  if you emmigrate.  which is prime reason why in my peer group of 6, only I am in California.
[01:08:45] <pompolic> ohh ok yeah
[01:09:16] <pompolic> covid put a bit of a damper on it, but i made friends over internet, which i could nucleate into a social network
[01:09:37] <SDr> pompolic, that's the evil part about not being able to not jump for an extended period of time. your social obligations compound naturally until the gravity of staging overwhelms your disgust with the system.

[01:11:16] <pompolic> it remains to be seen, to be honest, to what extent this plan will succeed, but it seems to have been decent for me
[01:12:01] <pompolic> however, i think this story supports your point -- they definitely have had an explicit policy of making it harder to attain escape velocity since the days of the student loan policy
[01:12:29] <pompolic> there are some extras like, if you work next to college, those times aren't grandfathered in to your loan agreement, so the clock only starts when you graduate
[01:12:43] <pompolic> although i recently heard that maybe they walked back on the loan agreement thing -- i'll need to check
[01:14:05] <pompolic> oh wait, i think I'm confusing it with the policy that was about subsidized courses, where each semester subsidized translated to having to work in hungary for n*2 semesters initially, or something like that

[02:38:31] <kiboneu> i can hear the cries of the ghosts of abandoned ideas at night
[02:38:56] <kiboneu> gwern: return oriented programming is a neat example of weird machine / emergent execution behavior

[02:39:46] <pompolic> i was imagining ROP but for image scaling operations
[02:40:10] <kiboneu> but he avoided them too. how can you be afraid of something and refuse to understand it?
[02:40:30] <pompolic> something that might also be relevant, is the chapter in SICP that dealt with drawing in lisp by composing functions etc.
[02:40:39] <pompolic> i think it was SICP anyway
[02:40:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> SICP is just one letter away from SCP
[02:40:54] <kiboneu> and my other dad got too pissed whenever he'd try to program anything back in the day. can't blame him, programming being in the state it was back in the day
[02:41:06] <pompolic> with this image scaling, i think there's a fixed pipeline of operations, right?
[02:41:29] <pompolic> like, it's gonna do roughly the same operation. or is it dependent on the images being processed?
[02:42:07] <pompolic> thinking this way, maybe you could derive a grammar for the image scaling pipeline
[02:42:17] <kiboneu> huh
[02:42:31] <pompolic> i'm shooting the shit primarily
[02:42:42] <kiboneu> "It is clear that scaling algorithms do not merely reduce the
[02:42:44] <kiboneu> frequencies in an image. These algorithms carefully interpolate the pixels of the source image before downscaling it in
[02:42:46] <kiboneu> order to mitigate the aliasing effect. This computation can be
[02:42:48] <kiboneu> described as a convolution between the source signal and a
[02:42:50] <kiboneu> kernel function [19]. For each position in the scaled image,
[02:42:52] <kiboneu> the kernel combines a set of pixels (samples) from the source
[02:42:54] <pompolic> also: channeling my other side side project
[02:42:54] <kiboneu> using a specific weighting. All scaling algorithms given in
[02:42:56] <kiboneu> Table 1 can be expressed using this concept.

[02:59:36] <kiboneu> take wolfram's writing on multiway graphs (for instance this https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/the-updating-process-for-string-substitution-systems/the-relationship-between-graphs-and-the-multiway-causal-graph/). it's pretty intuitive and you probably do this in your head, but it's a neat abstraction to concretize and model with. see how it applies to your reverse engineering

[02:59:38] <kiboneu> efforts and think about how you can automate identification of system components and external state using multiway graphs on trace recordings
[03:00:08] <ggreer> if only browsers had support for any sort of content-addressable protocol. sad
[03:00:49] <ggreer> that would solve the issue of 404s overnight. sadly nobody will allow it because then it's much easier to get around censorship
[03:01:40] <pompolic> these graphs as a collection of traces through program state space right
[03:02:15] <kiboneu> yeah; but there are memory states that are reachible via multiple executions on different input
[03:03:22] <kiboneu> and the shape of memory that gets shared between these states can inform a dynamic analyzer about the code operating on that state (as well as identify whether that state is modified externally, say via DMA / peripheral IMMRs)
[03:04:07] <kiboneu> this is useful for firmware REing; in userspace we have syscalls and a known ABI at least, even if a userspace program is stripped of symbols
[03:04:25] <kiboneu> and ida is excellent at statically taking apart a program
[03:04:53] <kiboneu> but i think we lack tools for doing this sort of dynamic analysis where the inputs and resulting executions are known
[03:06:15] <pompolic> yeah
[03:06:21] <kiboneu> basically we're really good at taking a picture of a program and inferring what it's about to do with a little known information about the environment. but not the other way aroujnd, where we take a recording of a program like a video and use that recording to inform us about said environment
[03:06:29] <pompolic> you'd want to dummy out a given peripheral with such a graph?
[03:06:41] <kiboneu> i think that'd be possible, yes
[03:06:49] <pompolic> that would probably be a godsend
[03:07:08] <kiboneu> sort of a prototyping tool for porting firmware targets into an emulator
[03:07:15] <pompolic> i was thinking about whether i could dummy out peripherals whose behavior i roughly knew, in qemu, so that i can actually run the firmware
[03:07:15] <gwern> ggreer: what I keep hearing about content-addressable and cache stuff being killed in browsers over is not censorship but anonymity/privacy
[03:08:48] <kiboneu> yeah, that's basically what i do, or use qemu-user and stub out peripheral state into file IO (with files representing some chunk of memory I can read / modify with a script)
[03:09:35] <pompolic> it is a testament to my idiocy that i haven't discovered that yet
[03:10:03] <kiboneu> nah i just collect tricks man that's all i do
[03:10:13] <pompolic> same
[03:10:26] <ggreer> I don't know. brave is starting to get ipfs support and they're one of the most privacy-focused browsers
[03:10:32] <pompolic> not to get off topic but like, i see the path i could have taken to disocovering it, but i didn't
[03:11:05] <pompolic> backing up: you want something that would see how peripheral memory evolves over time, and matches it to code running on the CPU? is that right?
[03:11:48] <kiboneu> that's one of the things a multi-trace recording can reveal, provided that each trace starts with the same input
[03:11:56] <pompolic> the path i mentioned: "wow it would be nice if i could map files into qemu memory to allow the binary i just ran not to crash" *reads documentation*
[03:11:59] <pompolic> i didn't read the docs :D
[03:12:05] <pompolic> right
[03:12:34] <kiboneu> so IMMRs that change due to, say the ethernet PHY being ready to tx or have messages waiting in them, should reveal themselves quickly
[03:12:56] <kiboneu> in other words, it depends on the inputs you're controlling for and the peripherals you think you don't control

[03:13:42] <kiboneu> in the case of separating out RTOS machinery from tasks, parsing machiner within tasks, and so on... changes in the input should map to changes in control flow that you're likely to care about
[03:14:22] <kiboneu> so if I'm interested in an http parser, I should change some http message and see what points in the CFG will change
[03:14:36] <kiboneu> and additionally denoise my trace by taking several of each input

[22:16:39] <two2thehead> "Findings suggest that middle-aged women have more time for work as they have passed the age of child-bearing and have older children who can share in the household activities. In contrast, younger women have less time to participate in labor force due to child-bearing responsibilities, illness of young children and lack of available substitution help. The data in Table 1 further shows that the majority of the borrowers are currently married and 
[22:16:39] <two2thehead> living with their husbands (78%), and a significant portion of borrowers (60%) are illiterate. The average combined monthly household income for borrowers is PKR 20,594. After combining average household income (PKR 20,594) and average number of household people (7.2), it was found that the average per day income for each household member is approximately PKR 95. After conversion to US Dollars it was ascertained that despite loan utilization, 
[22:16:39] <two2thehead> borrowers are still living below international poverty lines of USD 1.25."
