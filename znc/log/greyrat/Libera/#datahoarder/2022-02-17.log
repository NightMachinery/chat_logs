[23:05:15] <skye0> I don't use Signal but it's a shame to hear that, since I was looking to switch to Signal some day.
[23:05:54] <blaub> huh
[23:05:58] <skye0> Most of the games I'm into right now are by big publishers - minus the large online player count and graphics, all but The Sims 4 could be easily replicated
[23:06:29] <skye0> There's even a clone of Battlefield 2042 called Clownfield 2042, basically a low poly version of it with humorous lore.
[23:06:50] <rawktucc> skye0, there
[23:06:57] <rawktucc> there's not really anything wrong with it from the client perspective
[23:07:01] <rawktucc> it really depends on your risk level
[23:07:21] <rawktucc> signal messaging is pretty secure
[23:07:25] <rawktucc> the way messages are encoded 
[23:07:35] <skye0> apparently some Google involvement put people off of Signal
[23:07:41] <rawktucc> yes
[23:07:45] <rawktucc> they use google firepush or something
[23:07:48] <rawktucc> cloud push services
[23:07:49] <unfinity> ・゜゜・。 ​ 。・゜゜\_​ö< FLAP ​FLAP!
[23:07:53] <rawktucc> it helps with messages coming in
[23:08:00] <rawktucc> but i use signal with no google services at all, works fine
[23:08:03] <rawktucc> just uses more battery
[23:08:53] <skye0> nice to know it's usable without google stuff
[23:09:05] <rawktucc> theyre not really keen on you doing that
[23:09:16] <skye0> but the intel sgx thing might, although i expect that to maintain compatibility, AMD processors will need to enable it
[23:09:17] <rawktucc> normal warnings about it being "sfaer" from google play
[23:09:21] <rawktucc> maybe
[23:09:28] <skye0> this is even though Signal mostly runs on ARM-based devices
[23:09:57] <rawktucc> i thought they run on servers
[23:10:08] <skye0> want to upgrade my CPU and GPU just so it can run the games i want it to even better than it does but i will have to be care what I choose
[23:10:19] <skye0> maybe the client side is mostly an ARM-based affair
[23:11:01] <skye0> fuck i got this bad phlegm, snored last night quite badly
