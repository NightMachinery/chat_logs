[01:48:57] <lungaro_> If I want to import a file as a module, How would I do that?
[01:49:09] <lungaro_> using gopher-lua, I want to add this https://github.com/rxi/json.lua/blob/master/json.lua
[01:50:13] <technomancy> you mean require?
[01:50:28] <lungaro_> Yeah
[01:50:40] <technomancy> are you asking how to call the require function?
[01:50:45] <technomancy> it takes the module name as a string
[01:51:21] <lungaro_> I'm embedding lua into my project, and I want L.DoString() to load the json as if I did require("json")
[01:51:47] <lungaro_> (I turned json.lua into a string in go)
[01:52:06] <lungaro_> what i'm missing is, I see 'return json' in json.lua, so if I run DoString on it, do I need to pop the stack to get the json?
[01:52:16] <RhodiumToad> ah, easiest way to do that in a way that place nice with the module system is to make it a preloaded module
[01:52:26] <technomancy> oh so you like ... ran the code from the file, and got teh json table back, but it's not really a module yet?
[01:52:55] <technomancy> you can do something like `package.loaded.json = json` where json is the table you got back from your dostring thingy
[01:53:02] <RhodiumToad> don't do that
[01:53:08] <RhodiumToad> messing with package.loaded is bad
[01:53:15] <technomancy> how so?
[01:53:36] <technomancy> I mean, it's more correct to write your own package.searchers entry but like ... either way would get the job done afaik
[01:53:39] <RhodiumToad> doesn't necessarily play well with what require does
[01:53:54] <lungaro_> let me look if I can find something on preloaded modules
[01:54:12] <RhodiumToad> what I'd do is put a function in package.preload.json that runs load on the string and returns that
[01:54:14] <technomancy> RhodiumToad: I've never run into any issues doing that; can you go into detail?
[01:54:56] <lungaro_> Ah, I see. I think this is the ticket https://github.com/yuin/gopher-lua#creating-a-module-by-go
[01:56:14] <technomancy> my assumption is that require just returns teh value if it's found in package.loaded
[01:56:29] <RhodiumToad> looks like they added a PreloadModule method (which is not in standard lua) that just assigns to package.preload[name]
[01:56:52] <RhodiumToad> which is the same method I suggested above
[01:57:31] <technomancy> afaik the only difference is that preload will delay the loading until it's actually needed instead of doing it ahead of time?
[01:58:16] <RhodiumToad> right, if package.preload.foo is set to some function, then require('foo') will call that function and use its result as the module
[01:59:00] <technomancy> so the bad thing about setting package.loaded directly is that it could bypass a preload?
[02:04:48] <lungaro_> So if I DoString and Pop it should work with like L.PreloadModule("json", JsonLoader)
[02:05:34] <RhodiumToad> you shouldn't be popping anything
[02:05:50] <RhodiumToad> why not do it like that example?
[02:07:39] <lungaro_> because I need to use DoString
[02:09:06] <RhodiumToad> ok, you're hardcoding the string in the go program?
[02:10:20] <RhodiumToad> all you should need to do is write a function like that Loader() one in the example, but in the body, instead of SetFuncs etc. just do your DoString
[02:10:35] <RhodiumToad> and then return 1
[02:10:45] <lungaro_> got it
[02:11:24] <RhodiumToad> oh, hold on
[02:11:43] <RhodiumToad> that DoString is doing a protected call, yes? so you need to check if it returns an error
[02:11:53] <RhodiumToad> if so, reraise it rather than returning
[02:11:57] <lungaro_> i just wrote this and it works. But is it redundant?
[02:12:10] * RhodiumToad doesn't use go
[02:12:20] <RhodiumToad> redundant?

[02:13:16] <lungaro_> https://dpaste.org/Ymsv
[02:14:21] <RhodiumToad> I'd throw rather than returning 0, I think
[02:14:31] <RhodiumToad> the popping and pushing is not right

[02:15:18] <lungaro_> it seems redundant if I understand it correctly
[02:15:23] <RhodiumToad> I have no idea how it works
[02:16:55] <lungaro_> k, i'll come back to that specific part. I got a lot to iron out
[02:17:06] <RhodiumToad> I don't know how this API differs from the PUC one, I don't think the code you have there is possible in stock lua
[02:18:18] <RhodiumToad> (in stock lua, lua values can't exist except on the stack/upvalues)

[02:26:34] <lungaro_> can someone help me with this lua? https://dpaste.org/Ox1G -- I'm wondering why I need this tolist function at all. I can't seem to get the values out of the list w/o iterating
[02:28:03] <Tricycle> maybe grep doesn't return a list but a custom thing? try to print(type(x))
[02:28:25] <lungaro_> Yeah, it does.
[02:28:49] <Tricycle> I mean, the line 'for i, v in x' suspiciously lack a pair or ipairs
[02:29:27] <RhodiumToad> that looks like grep returns an iterator, i.e. it's expecting you to do   for v in grep(...)
[02:29:45] <Tricycle> <lungaro_> Yeah, it does. <- don't lie to me please
[02:29:59] <lungaro_> It's a custom thing, what do you mean?
[02:30:13] <Tricycle> Ah I thought you meant it return a list
[02:30:16] <lungaro_> its a "LUserData" from gopher-lua -- a go type
[02:30:24] <lungaro_> i was agreeing with you!
[02:30:25] <RhodiumToad> you should never assume that the result of an iterator function like that is a single value
[02:30:37] <Tricycle> Well, then you can't get the value out of the list because it's not a list, easy!
[02:30:45] <RhodiumToad> especially in 5.4+, it may be all 4 values even if the work is being done in a closure
[02:31:26] <RhodiumToad> so i think that code should be   local ret = {}  for v in grep(...) do ret[1+#ret] = v end
[02:31:58] <RhodiumToad> (table.insert is usually slower for inserting at the end, esp. in 5.4)
[02:32:05] <lungaro_> gotcha, ok. well i'm 5.1
[02:32:13] <lungaro_> i'll just keep this helper function around then
[02:32:21] <RhodiumToad> no
[02:32:39] <RhodiumToad> that tolist function is actively wrong in that it's assuming that x is one value, when it might be three
[02:33:24] <RhodiumToad> you could make it variadic instead

[02:34:19] <RhodiumToad> a function intended to be called as   for blah in func(...)   will return three results in 5.1-5.3, and possibly four in 5.4

[20:31:36] <lungaro_> i'm trying to simulate a continue statement. I'm sure its an FAQ at this point
[20:31:45] <lungaro_> In lua 5.1, is there a way to emulate this?

[21:25:58] <lungaro_> can I do or somehow in matches with string.match ?
[21:26:55] <Elw3> ?
[21:27:53] <bomb> lungaro_ please excuse our guy Elw3. you'd want string.gsub
[21:28:40] <lungaro_> Sorry, that question got really broken being condensed down. 
[21:28:51] <Elw3> this doesnt make any sense...
[21:29:03] <lungaro_> I dont want to replace, I just want to see if a string has some words in it, like  grep -- 'vendor:\|serial:\|configuration:'
[21:29:58] <Elw3> Dependin on the what you look for it is smarter to just look for all words and then see if the result is on your search list.
[21:30:24] <Elw3> That at least allows a giant search list without hazzle.
[21:34:02] <furq> you can't do alternation in matches
[21:34:43] <bomb> lungaro_ string.gfind, then
[21:34:55] <furq> there is no such function
[21:35:30] <bomb> do you any proof that it does not exist? otherwise, string.gstfu
[21:36:07] <bomb> just kidding, please excuse me :)
[21:38:31] <Elw3> please do not excuse bomb.
[21:48:53] <bomb> let me save you guys some time:    https://r-roms.github.io/
[21:49:15] <bomb> it's the closest thing to a time machine right now.
