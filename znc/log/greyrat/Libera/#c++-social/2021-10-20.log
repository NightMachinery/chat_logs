[16:59:59] <jotham> do you cunts work with australians much
[17:00:04] <jotham> they are like little pretend americans
[17:00:09] <jotham> it's a massive wind up
[17:00:30] <jotham> this job i am on has two australian managers
[17:00:38] <jotham> i want to poke my eyes, or their eyes out
[17:08:49] <jotham> i guess the upside is
[17:08:55] <jotham> they are having a fight with china
[17:09:01] <jotham> so the rest of us don't have to
[17:09:14] <jotham> and they wont take any shit
[17:09:26] <MaNI> they're the one nationality I've managed to avoid working with
[17:10:17] <MaNI> I quoted an australian company once and sat in a few skype meetings with them, no further than that though
[17:10:19] <jotham> nz is *really* unprofessional
[17:10:22] <jotham> like a badge of pride
[17:10:26] <jotham> we'd rather get the job done
[17:10:31] <jotham> than do the job right
[17:10:36] <jotham> so they lambast us for that
[17:10:49] <jotham> most of our government rules come from australia
[17:11:33] <jotham> living in europe was weird
[17:11:36] <jotham> all the jobs i did
[17:11:43] <jotham> everyone was preoccupied with covering their asses
[17:11:51] <jotham> like every decision needed a higher up boss
[17:11:53] <jotham> all the time
[17:11:59] <jotham> no one would just do something
[17:12:08] <jotham> aussie isn't that bad
[17:12:14] <jotham> it's performatively like that though
[17:12:30] <jotham> i was surpised western europe could do anything ever
[17:13:07] <jotham> i figure there is still some colonial energy in nz
[17:14:13] <jotham> MaNI: south africa is a weird place to rationalise/fantasize about colonial energy
[17:14:23] <jotham> you guys have been abandoned so many times
[17:14:34] <jotham> do you consider south africa colonial
[17:15:15] <MaNI> not really, but the extremists who want to burnt he place down sure do
[17:15:18] <jotham> once bankruptcy is over i want to come visit, work maybe if i can get it
[17:16:08] <jotham> i'm a free man in march, gonna be amazing
[17:16:25] <jotham> 3 years of government financial control is a bit rough
[17:16:33] <jotham> i mean, better than jail, right
[17:16:37] <jotham> but still it's been harsh
[17:17:08] <jotham> south africa must have similar prospects to australia in terms of solar and wind
[17:17:28] <jotham> but foreign money is corrupting it
[17:17:53] <jotham> from pictures i've seen it looks very similar to au/nz climate
[17:18:52] <Renderwww> never had to deal with australians
[17:19:12] <jotham> it really surpises me you and MaNI never had to deal with them
[17:19:18] <Renderwww> the only time I met aussies in real life was in japan
[17:19:20] <jotham> when i travelled i found them fucking everywhere
[17:19:34] <MaNI> don't think they like za much
[17:19:42] <jotham> the cape must be a wind farm wet dream https://earth.nullschool.net/#current/wind/surface/level/orthographic=-331.33,-32.19,2030
[17:19:51] <MaNI> because we beat them at cricket and rugby sometimes or something, and have people with dark skin
[17:19:52] <jotham> and pirates can hardly fuck about down there
[17:20:03] <Oxyd> One would think that you Wrong-Hemispherians would band together.
[17:20:12] <jotham> haha
[17:20:26] <jotham> nz has lots of plants from peru and brazil
[17:20:35] <jotham> that's about as close as we've got
[17:20:57] <MaNI> za is perfect for solar, but our government policy on solar is pants on head, so that stunts it
[17:21:00] <Renderwww> for how long will you stay a free man? you travel somewher to work and they fuck you over again for stealing tax moonies!
[17:21:01] <jotham> made tea out of this bad boy yesterday
[17:21:41] <MaNI> cape and wind farms, yes and no, we do have a few
[17:21:48] <Renderwww> jotham confirmed to be a canibal brewing kids
[17:21:49] <MaNI> a lot of areas here are too windy (or so I'm told) and especially too gusty
[17:22:01] <jotham> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropaeolum
[17:22:03] <MaNI> apparently wind farms like steady medium winds and gusty winds are bad
[17:22:06] <jotham> it's weird if you just eat it
[17:22:09] <jotham> it's very peppery
[17:22:16] <jotham> but in a tea it just tastes ... green
[17:22:22] <jotham> like grass or whatever
[17:22:26] <jotham> it's not very exciting
[17:22:33] <jotham> i am always looking for new plants to make tea from
[17:22:36] <yano> https://capslockday.org/
[17:22:37] <jotham> anyway it's south american
[17:22:40] <jotham> grows well here
[17:22:49] <jotham> lots of good plants are from south america
[17:23:15] <Renderwww> that url is lying, it should be capslockdayS.org
[17:23:41] <Renderwww> because using one fucking day for that silly thing wasn't enough
[17:23:45] <jotham> MaNI: bbc was saying part of why they are fucked is because they have the lowest wind speeds in 40 years
[17:23:50] <jotham> consistently
[17:23:55] <jotham> like nature is like
[17:23:57] <jotham> fuck climate change
[17:24:05] <jotham> made me laugh how bad that is
[17:24:24] <jotham> plus a fire in their french power interchange
[17:24:32] <jotham> so no mainland power
[17:24:34] <MaNI> I've always thought that relying a lot on wind is a dumbass strategy
[17:24:42] <jotham> yeah i dunno
[17:24:55] <jotham> this german company is trialing an experiment at 50mw in poland
[17:25:08] <MaNI> plus EU is busy committing self sabotage by turning off perfectly good nuke plants and whatnot
[17:25:11] <jotham> where they have graphite structures that have aluminium in them
[17:25:16] <jotham> and the aluminium phase changes
[17:25:22] <MaNI> so they kind of deserve some outages so that they can feel like tits about it
[17:25:28] <jotham> and they can provide 700C water reliably for up to 3 days after power
[17:25:36] <jotham> which is the same temp coal plants produce steam at
[17:25:42] <Renderwww> isn't it only germany that is switching of nukes?
[17:25:47] <jotham> so they can replace coal boilers and turn coal plants into batteries
[17:25:50] <jotham> which is pretty cool
[17:26:02] <jotham> 1-4 day batteries
[17:26:04] <MaNI> weren't the french planning on it as well?
[17:26:07] <jotham> but same coal turbine plant
[17:26:11] <MaNI> I don't know I don't follow too closely 
[17:26:16] <jotham> well these guys have a working one in poland
[17:26:21] <jotham> and are gonna spam the UK with it
[17:26:38] <Renderwww> I always had the impression the french are way to dependent on npps to considering switching them off
[17:27:13] <MaNI> https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53233385
[17:27:14] <jotham> do you think french nuclear is the french preoccupation with being 'the best' at engineering
[17:27:51] <jotham> the french are in charge of that chinese new plant that had to shut down
[17:27:53] <MaNI> "France has pledged to reduce its reliance on nuclear power by shutting down 12 nuclear reactors by 2035."
[17:27:57] <jotham> but that new plant is the future of nuclear
[17:28:05] <jotham> finland is building the same plant
[17:28:23] <Renderwww> yeah, good luck with that france!
[17:28:26] <MaNI> but I don't follow that closely, other than knowing about germany of course
[17:28:34] <jotham> taishan 
[17:28:50] <jotham> did you guys see how they sculpted it out of bedrock
[17:28:53] <jotham> it's pretty cool
[17:28:57] <Renderwww> it works in germany because we can just buy electricity from all the countries around us when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing
[17:29:09] <MaNI> yeah, so when france do it as well you're screwed
[17:30:28] <jotham> our wind plants don't really dip
[17:30:42] <jotham> turns out being at the arse end of the world means the weather is a son of a bitch
[17:31:14] <jotham> no goldilocks zone
[17:31:32] <MaNI> wind here feels like its actively trying to kill me for about 80% of the year
[17:31:38] <MaNI> the other 20% of the year is quite nice
[17:32:17] <jotham> my city is famous for brutal wind, i think it's because of the two islands being next to each other
[17:32:26] <jotham> the tasman sea and pacific ocean meet in the middle
[17:32:31] <jotham> and the wind is fucking outrageous
[17:32:49] <jotham> it's killed thousands of people
[17:33:00] <jotham> even these days ships regularly get in trouble
[17:33:14] <MaNI> sounds like humans shouldn't be there
[17:33:21] <jotham> what's funny is you can be walking along
[17:33:29] <jotham> and where there is a gap between the buildings, in the city
[17:33:34] <jotham> the wind can be like 80kmph
[17:33:38] <jotham> and you just get smoked
[17:33:46] <jotham> fall over, bang along the ground
[17:33:52] <jotham> seen heaps of people get sniped by the wind
[17:33:56] <jotham> it's very stupid
[17:34:22] <MaNI> yeah the way buildings and stuff enhance it can be quite crazy
[17:34:53] <jotham> i think you'd be hard pressed to say humans shouldn't live here
[17:35:03] <jotham> root crops grow well, it's mostly mild climate
[17:35:09] <jotham> sheep fucking love it
[17:35:31] <jotham> we have no dangerous predators, unlike australia
[17:35:34] <jotham> no spiders or snakes
[17:36:17] <jotham> from what i've read the theory is birds dominated NZ so hard that insects and reptiles couldn't get a foothold
[17:37:07] <jotham> think i'm trying to convince MaNI to move his jort empire to NZ
[17:37:14] <jotham> but he'd have to work online
[17:37:22] <jotham> assume he does already
[17:37:28] <jotham> only 80ms ping to america west coast

[17:39:47] <MaNI> I should be living on some tropical island somewhere
[17:39:51] <lumberluch0> I wouldn't worry for birds (as a whole) just yet. Birds are survivors.

[17:43:27] <jotham> when the kiwi is stressed
[17:43:30] <jotham> it stands still
[17:43:35] <jotham> because the major predator was a hawk
[17:43:46] <jotham> but a golden labrador just goes and picks it up
[17:43:49] <jotham> cause it wont move
