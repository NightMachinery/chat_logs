[00:14:17] <ormaaj> The point was to make it easier to modify programmatically. As an alternate use another array and have PROMPT_COMMAND eval the elements.
[00:14:47] <justsomeguy> Wait, ''test -v assoc_arr'' doesn't work? ...how do you determine if an associative array is defined or not, then?
[00:15:38] <greycat> You define it, and then you know that it's defined, because you defined it.
[00:15:45] <ormaaj> justsomeguy: apparently [[ ${arr@a} ]]
[00:15:47] <uplime> you can usually do [[ -v associative_array[@] ]] to see, but it has to have at least one leemnt

[02:02:42] <emanuele6> yes, ok, but that is not what he meant

[02:15:37] <emanuele6> this eval trick
[02:15:44] <uplime> ah
[02:15:49] <emanuele6> that temporarly sets IFS
[02:15:52] <emanuele6> or any variable
[02:16:23] <uplime> well the temporary assignment is still a thing for external commands. eval just obviously can't be one
[02:16:39] <edk> it seems to be only not a thing for special builtins

[02:16:50] <emanuele6> uplime: no, it's not temporary in posix

[14:45:58] <pj> earnestly: I'd imagine that there's a better way still, but <<<"$z" is going to be better than echo $z |
[14:47:33] <earnestly> pj: Yes, the "anti-pattern" of either is usually indicative of the same problem.  Sometimes unavoidable but it's often sad to see it.  I.e. var=$(cmd) var2=$(cmd2 <<< "$var") var3=$(cmd3 <<< "$var"), etc.
[14:48:07] <earnestly> Often these sorts of things can be done through process subsitition or just a simple pipeline if more thought is given to the flow

[14:48:28] <pj> yeah, I'd have to see more code that the single line to be able to suggest something, though.
[14:48:35] <earnestly> pj: At least recent bash doesn't use tmp files for <<< anymore?

[14:50:47] <earnestly> Yeah, for all I know it makes no difference

[14:51:11] <earnestly> The goal here is really just to not let the password appear in ps output
[14:51:38] <ormaaj> Doesn't matter. Bash unlinks it immediately. Anyone with permission to mess with the file could do the same with the pipe
[14:51:46] <earnestly> This is a fair point
[14:52:00] <pj> ormaaj: ahhhh, right.

[14:53:08] <pj> well, yes and no, with a pipe if you read from it the data's gone, but with a tmp file someone could snoop on it without breaking the parent program?  That said it would be an extremely lucky race to win either way.
[14:54:06] <ormaaj> pipes have their own quirks. You can play with the buffer via `ungetc` and the like.
[14:54:31] <pj> oh true
[14:54:32] <ormaaj> (with limitations)
[14:54:52] <pj> yeah, that wouldn't exactly be easy to pull off if you're in a race either.
[14:55:55] <pj> you might get the char before the other program does, but then to be able to turn around and ungetc it right away?  consistently?

[14:57:47] <pj> earnestly: exactly, and I would still question if they can pull that off.
[14:58:10] <ormaaj> well I haven't experimented. ungetc probably only messes with the library side buffer. There would need to be a syscall to do the same to the kernel buffer
[14:58:26] <earnestly> bpftrace can effectively hook files, even running a VM can be made to step individual instructions, so anything non-atomic can be manipulated
[14:58:29] <pj> at any rate, I never worried about the tmp file that bash creates all that much.  To me it's an implementation detail that I would rather not have to be thinking about when coding.

That recent ebpf exploit is not actually an ebpf exploit. it's an arbitrary location kernel memory write (though with a fixed string, as I understand it). Going by their writeup, using that to bypass ebpf restrictions does not require root access since ebpf programs can 
[15:45:51] <TomyWork> be run as an unprivileged user

[17:14:44] <pgnd> I want to wrap a desktop app launch in a bash script -- with the goal of exec'ing Pre-launch and Post-quit tasks.
[17:14:44] <pgnd> If I script
[17:14:44] <pgnd>   #!/bin/bash; exec pre-launch task; launch app as "/path/to/app "@$" &; exec post-quit task
[17:14:44] <pgnd> does that "... &" keep this script active until AFTER normal quit/exit from the app, so that the post-quit task execs?
[17:14:44] <pgnd> Not sure I can/should do this this way :-/
[17:15:12] <Soliton> !&
[17:15:13] <greybot> If you put the control operator & at the end of a command, e.g. ''command args &'', the shell executes the command in the background in a subshell. The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0. Pid of the last backgrounded command is available via the special variable $!
[17:15:28] <Soliton> no clue why you would run it in the background.
[17:15:59] <Soliton> i expect you just want: /path/to/app "$@"
[17:16:44] <terabyte> ah, i got basedir and dirname the wrong way round, it works :)
[17:16:49] <terabyte> thanks for the help
[17:16:50] <Soliton> also don't use exec except for the post-quit task in case you meant that literally.
[17:17:05] <pgnd> Soliton: and the 'just' "$@" doesn't return in the script until after 'app' quits normally?
[17:17:17] <pgnd> heh, no -- not literal exec here.  forgot abt that ...
[17:18:36] <Soliton> commands run until termination and then the next command is executed.
[17:20:53] <Soliton> terabyte: if "$(basename $pathmyfolder)" is literally your code then you're missing quotes around the variable expansion.

[20:57:31] <lopid> !pe
[20:57:31] <greybot> Parameter Expansion expands parameters: "$foo", "$1". You can use it to perform string or array operations: "${file%.mp3}", "${0##*/}", "${files[@]: -4}". They should *always* be quoted. See: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/073 and "Parameter Expansion" in man bash. Also see http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/pe.
[20:58:13] <eggbean> Thanks
[21:00:03] <twkm> some prefer (-1) instead of space-1, i.e., ${var:(-1)}, or even ((-1)) which some feel even more strongly shows that an arithmetic value is meant, i.e., ${var:((-1))}.
[21:01:41] <eggbean> oh yeh, means last token
