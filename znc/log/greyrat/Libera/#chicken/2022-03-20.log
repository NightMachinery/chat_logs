[11:53:12] <wasamasa> I've looked some more at the possible warnings/errors reported during compilation and it seems that they could be a lot easier to parse
[12:14:47] <wasamasa> either it's several consecutive lines all starting with "Warning:" at the left column or several consecutive lines where the first starts with "Warning:" and every follow-up line is indented

[14:12:28] <Bunny351> wasamasa: that's true. I once had the idea of showing all warnings/compilations as valid S-expressions, never followed that through, though...
[14:12:56] <Bunny351> on the other hand: grep is mighty, or awk...
[14:13:35] <wasamasa> I wrote some terrible elisp code that uses heuristics
[14:13:54] <Bunny351> heuristics tend to be ... ugly
[14:13:58] <wasamasa> I'd need a comprehensive list of all possible compile-time errors/warnings though to test it
[14:14:11] <wasamasa> I found some .expected files in the tests directory
[14:15:09] <wasamasa> it searches for ^Warning:, then forwards one line to see if it's a block of consecutive ^Warning: lines or just one followed by indented text until the next ^(Warning|Error): line

[17:26:27] <wasamasa> alright, I made flymake-chicken.el

[17:27:33] <nulluint> wasamasa: thank you!
[17:27:42] <nulluint> that is so nice of you, I cannot believe you did that. Thank you!
[17:27:44] <wasamasa> 77 SLOC

[17:50:53] <wasamasa> oh wait
[17:51:01] <wasamasa> I think I'm supposed to add it to github
[17:51:09] <wasamasa> sigh
[17:52:35] <wasamasa> https://github.com/chicken-contrib/flymake-chicken
[17:53:11] <nulluint> wasamasa: thank you so much!
[18:03:21] <s-liao> What is the reason for us to have a new version of flymake-chicken.el.
[18:05:11] <wasamasa> because there is a new version of flymake
[18:05:25] <wasamasa> if flymake changes, all users of flymake need to adapt
[18:20:02] <s-liao> is this one https://github.com/flymake/emacs-flymake?
[18:20:55] <wasamasa> that's an unrelated fork
[18:21:05] <wasamasa> flymake comes bundled with emacs
[18:28:16] <s-liao> Okay.
[18:29:00] <s-liao> Which source file are they?
[18:30:59] <s-liao> I searched in the folder emacs-27.1-src/, But can not find out the related source files.
[18:34:37] <wasamasa> M-x find-library RET flymake RET
