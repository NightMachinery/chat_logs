[00:36:24] <mario-goulart> Regarding the warning, I'm not sure the replacement for current-milliseconds is available in earlier CHICKEN 5 versions.  I'm assuming it would be dumb to remove current-milliseconds before CHICKEN 6, so I just leave it.
[00:37:55] <mario-goulart> In case the replacement for current-milliseconds is not available in earlier CHICKEN versions, I think that deprecation warning should just be dropped from CHICKEN (assuming current-milliseconds will stay until CHICKEN 6).
[00:44:28] <mario-goulart> Yeah, current-process-milliseconds is not even available in 5.2.  I just ignore that warning.  IMO having that deprecation warning is a mistake.  Removing current-milliseconds before C6 would be an even bigger mistake.

[02:08:41] <elflng> siiky: the problem is that its not an automatable process, imho.
[02:09:23] <elflng> programming is not automatable. having something that can find and correct bugs is, in a particular sense, something that requires reading the mind of the programmer.
[02:10:25] <elflng> in my first job, i remember going through the parsers that my boss - one of the best, if not the best, programmers that i have ever had the pleasure of knowing - had written for the data feeds
[02:10:42] <elflng> and being surprised because they seemed like total nonsense and the worst possible way of doing this.
[02:11:07] <elflng> and after digging into it, and having him explain what was going it, it became clear that the exact opposite was the case - it was provably the most efficient possible way of doing so.
[02:11:44] <elflng> did you ever read 'a story of a real programmer' that was in the early hackers dictionary/jargon file?
[02:12:26] <vandusen> [eggs] Error fetching CHICKEN 5 .release-info file for the following eggs: edn, awful-sse
[02:12:29] <elflng> https://outpost9.com/reference/jargon/jargon_49.html
[02:13:52] <elflng> now, almost every non-trivial programme has aspects similar to this - perhaps not as dramatic or as brilliant, but similarly counterintuitive...
[02:14:20] <elflng> and moreover - ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to handle in an automated way without an actual intelligence powering it.
[02:14:45] <elflng> at which point we're talking about an AI complete problem, which means it can safely be ignored.
[02:15:18] <elflng> to debug a programme, one has to understand the programme. a computer does not understand.
[02:16:03] <elflng> which goes back to the point 'but it can help with the trivial cases' ... except a) the trivial cases should be handled by the programmer him/herself, and b) the trivial cases may actually break whats going on if debugged without understanding.
[02:18:36] <elflng> the reason why spam filtering is pretty much a lost cause is by exploiting this very principle - computers are not a substitute for something that can understand, and trying to use them as such is a fail.
[02:18:41] <elflng> </rant>
[02:20:07] <Zipheir> "ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to handle in an automated way..." [citation needed]
[02:20:42] <elflng> i gave a citation above :
[02:21:35] <elflng> a more chicken-oriented issue : type assignment in the general case.
[02:22:21] <Zipheir> Ok, proof needed that this is incomputible in principal.
[02:22:37] <elflng> it reduces to the halting paradox.
[02:22:47] <elflng> exercise intentionally left for the reader :)
[02:23:03] <elflng> but that should have been enough of a hint.
[02:23:29] <Zipheir> So.... "every non-trivial programme" can't be computed?
[02:24:11] <elflng> no, it is impossible to compute if any non-trivial programme is correct or not.
[02:24:54] <Zipheir> Well, that's something different.  But for certain ideas of "correct" people do this with provers frequently.
[02:25:18] <elflng> and if you have a better concept of general-case debugging than 'determining correctness'...
[02:25:38] <elflng> sure, for certain trivial/restricted domains, its possible.
[02:25:48] <elflng> but its not possible for the set of all strings containing programmes.
[02:25:50] <Zipheir> But more centrally, appealing to "actual intelligence" is moving the goalposts.
[02:26:02] <elflng> no, its the same goalposts a i stated originally.
[02:26:05] <elflng> as, even
[02:26:29] <elflng> that automated debuggers are no substitute for human intelligence, and are in fact a step backwards.
[02:26:58] <elflng> to clarify why theyre a step backwards, before you ask...
[02:27:17] <Zipheir> No doubt they are.  I'm arguing that debugging the way humans do is not in principal something only human brains can do.
[02:27:29] <elflng> and i strongly disagree, for the reasons stated above.
[02:28:00] <elflng> debugging as humans do it - or at least the way i do it - requires understanding and expectation
[02:28:18] <elflng> expectation may be augmentable, but understanding is not.
[02:28:35] <elflng> i dont know how other people debug, so i cant answer if there is a general way that humans debug.
[02:29:15] <Zipheir> Well, human brains are material lumps of stuff that perform these tasks, so I'd argue the Church/Turing Thesis says there's nothing magical about human debugging.
[02:29:23] <elflng> hrm?
[02:29:40] <Zipheir> In principal, computable by other lumps of material stuff.
[02:29:51] <elflng> except humans can recognise if something is uncomputable.
[02:30:04] <elflng> without breaking themselves
[02:30:20] <elflng> and without doing so probabalistically or statistically.
[02:30:41] <Zipheir> Sorry, that's silly.  That's like saying that if you tell an AI Russell's Paradox they'll emit smoke and say DOES NOT COMPUTE.
[02:30:55] <elflng> also, youre assuming that the human brain is a turing machine, which it isnt. :
[02:30:56] <elflng> :)
[02:31:25] <elflng> no, im saying that the methods for detecting paradox are not by detecting paradox...
[02:31:37] <Zipheir> I don't assume that it *is*, but that it's equivalent to one, per Church/Turing.
[02:31:59] <elflng> i dont think that thats necessarily true. youre assuming that thoughts are computable.
[02:32:18] <elflng> which, again, if you can give a representation for thought, perhaps you may be right, but to date, no such thing exists.
[02:32:18] <Zipheir> Without defining thoughts, I can't say anything about that.
[02:32:35] <elflng> right, so we dont know if the human brain is just a computer. i would argue against it
[02:32:43] <Zipheir> Because maybe thinking is an illusion (cf. Hofstader)
[02:32:51] <elflng> but i cant prove that. bleh to hofstader :) 
[02:33:20] <Zipheir> Sure, I am very much not arguing that a brain is just a squishy digital computer.
[02:33:38] <elflng> (i wish i knew who stole my copy of metamagical themas
[02:33:40] <elflng> )
[02:34:04] <Zipheir> Just that it is fundamentally a (100% material, no magical tissues!) computing thing, and, as such, basic results about computability apply to it.
[02:34:09] <elflng> so if its not just a squishy computer, then why are we assuming that everything that goes on in it is modelable by computer?
[02:34:20] <elflng> that is, that it is merely some form of computer?
[02:34:39] <elflng> i dont know if its fundamentally a computing thing.
[02:34:49] <Zipheir> Yes.  Not a squishy von Neumann-architecture register machine, of course.
[02:35:04] <elflng> 60 years of research seem to indicate that there is a lot more going on than something merely doing computation
[02:35:09] <Zipheir> Metamagical Themas is very good.
[02:36:01] <Zipheir> Well, the question is then, if a brain isn't just computing, what else is it doing?  Obviously it does a lot of computing (input processing, organ function monitoring, etc.)
[02:36:24] <elflng> one of my friends from uni was working on using goldfish brains to act as pattern recognisers for missile defence, or something suchlike.
[02:36:37] <Zipheir> By which I mean, those are things that our artifacts do, so we *know* computing is a good way to talk about them.
[02:36:47] <elflng> if i could answer that, i'd have written a proper AI by now :)
[02:37:18] <elflng> if we knew what else was going on, we could do something about it, but so far, all we can say is that something else is going on that doesnt seem to fit into a computable model, or at least not any model we've tried so far.
[02:37:39] <elflng> its a reasonable question but one i cant answer.
[02:38:03] <elflng> perhaps another related question is 'is creativity a computable process?'
[02:38:21] <Zipheir> Sure.  Hofstader talks about that one a lot.
[02:38:29] <elflng> yes, but he doesnt get anywhere with it.
[02:38:31] <elflng> :)
[02:38:59] <Zipheir> I like Dennett's mantra for dealing with these questions: "No wonder tissue!"
[02:39:07] * elflng shrugs.
[02:39:23] <elflng> im religious, so i have my own thoughts regarding this, but theyre not relevant to the discussion. :)
[02:39:55] <elflng> (part of what pushed me towards religion was working in AI for 2 decades. im a little slower than perlis. :) )
[02:39:59] <Zipheir> I mean, they are relevant, because certain beliefs about the universe might make wonder tissue make perfect sense to you.
[02:40:13] <elflng> eh, i dont think the tissue has much to do with it.
[02:40:51] <elflng> which is why it goes into irrelevance in the sense of this conversation, which i will have to leave in a few mins to continue getting ready for Shabbos, but i may be back later tonight.
[02:41:07] <Zipheir> Ok, maybe something more like Descartes's pineal gland which connects your physical and mental components.
[02:41:17] <Zipheir> OK, have a good evening. :)
[02:41:38] <elflng> oke, bezras Hashem ill be back later tonight, if not, ill be back sat night. have a good night :)

[19:54:52] <johnjaye> is that a euphemism for clang?
[20:08:37] <wasamasa> no
[20:09:01] <wasamasa> it's a runner using C5 on freebsd, but compiled with gcc (and using gcc for eggs)
[20:09:15] <johnjaye> i see
[20:09:32] <johnjaye> i just assumed clang was the only option since it displays it repeatedly on bootup on my bsd laptop
[20:09:44] <wasamasa> you can install gcc from ports just fine
[20:10:08] <johnjaye> ah. that opens up many questions for me
[20:10:17] <johnjaye> for starters, how do you tell it to use gnu make not the default make
[20:11:19] <wasamasa> there's this convention to install it as gmake
[20:11:28] <wasamasa> so it can be automatically detected and used
[20:11:56] <johnjaye> automatically sounds scary. like would you have to change 'make' to 'gmake' in every Makefile?
[20:12:16] <wasamasa> some projects do that for you
[20:12:28] <wasamasa> they don't assume that the make command is accessible under that name
[20:16:00] <johnjaye> hmm. i searched chicken sources for 'freebsd' and only got 3 hits
[20:16:36] <johnjaye> are the build instructions for it specific to that egg you mentioned?
[20:18:37] <wasamasa> build instructions for what?
[20:18:40] <wasamasa> C5 on freebsd?
[20:18:53] <wasamasa> taglib on freebsd?
[20:19:45] <johnjaye> i guess the former. i havent' build chicken on freebsd actually
[20:19:50] <johnjaye> just installed the binary iirc
[20:19:54] <johnjaye> is it a port?
[20:20:01] <wasamasa> yes
[20:20:09] <wasamasa> you can build from source, too
[20:20:43] <wasamasa> install gmake, invoke vmake

[20:21:34] <johnjaye> ok. i'm trying to figure out where the actual work is being done.
[20:21:48] <johnjaye> it sounds like when the individual port maintainer makes a port they use gmake or whatever is specific
[20:23:20] <wasamasa> https://cgit.freebsd.org/ports/tree/lang/chicken5/Makefile
[20:24:28] <johnjaye> USES = cpe gmake
[20:24:37] <johnjaye> well i guess that answers my question. thanks
