[00:57:38] <Patsie> awk exit doesn't lead to a broken pipe, it just EOF's it's output
[00:58:02] <Patsie> like there is no more data
[01:03:12] <earnestly> I assume it was the processing sending data to awk which would get sigpipe
[01:03:15] <earnestly> process*
[01:04:00] <Patsie> ah, true
[01:04:52] <Patsie> if the remaining sending data is bigger than the pipe size (usually 4k) then indeed it might

[05:04:03] <yitz> Usually it's a non-issue. If the pipe is small or the data large, then you see issues
[05:04:11] <yitz> If you run with set -o pipefail, then you get errors
[05:05:09] <yitz> Most times, most cases, it's a non-issue. But sometimes it can be an issue. Just something to be aware of.

[21:24:09] <dfdx> Hi #awk
[21:25:06] <dfdx> I am trying to parse a file that has dates in this format: m/d/yy (so, for example, 5/3/21 would be May 3rd, 2021). I want to convert these dates to mm/dd/yyyy format (so, 05/03/2021). I can do that with the "date" command like this: date -d "$mydate" +%m/%d/%Y
[21:25:17] <dfdx> but i'm struggling to actually put that into an awk script. 
[21:25:40] <dfdx> I know I can run commands by quoting them, something like "date" | getline mydate, etc. but i'm not sure how to slip in the variable that contains the date I'm trying to modify
[21:26:02] <dfdx> I'm trying to leverage the date command on my machine because I don't want to manually parse that date in awk itself, but if I have to I will.
[21:27:34] *** Joins: TanoMarcelo (~TanoMarce@179.63.242.126)
[21:36:59] <dfdx> nvm... I think I figured it out, with system().
[21:37:41] <dfdx> ugh, no, nvm. that prints the new date format to the terminal, but doesn't save it to a variable lol.

[21:45:54] <nmz> you're almost there
[21:45:57] <nmz> :)
[21:48:30] <dfdx> nmz: thanks for the encouragement! I think I got it.
[21:48:35] <dfdx> "date +%m/%d/%Y -d '" date "'" | getline mydate; close(date);
[21:48:52] <dfdx> sorry, using 'date' twice here in different ways. the second 'date' is a variable with the string.
[21:49:26] <dfdx> the first is the program date
[21:49:35] <dfdx> and mydate is the new variable with the new string. phew!
[21:50:56] <nmz> use match() and substr()
[21:51:31] <nmz> however, strftime in gawk
[21:51:36] <nmz> as well
[21:51:49] <nmz> because if its a lot of dates, the commands | getline will take too long
[21:51:56] <nmz> avoid forks
[21:59:42] <dfdx> I tried using stfrtime but I kept getting 12/31/1969 (epoch?) as a result.
[21:59:59] <dfdx> e.g., printf stfrtime("%m/%d/%Y", mydate);  # where mydate = "5/6/21"

[22:38:22] <geirha> it expects the date in seconds since epoch, not a string
[22:40:17] <geirha> there's no strptime, so to convert a date from an arbitrary format to seconds since epoch, you need to use string manipulation to convert it into the format mktime() expects
