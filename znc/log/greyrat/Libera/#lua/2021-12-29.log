[04:20:51] <texasmynsted> why would luarocks appear to work and install a module, locally using --local but then not find it from the lua command 'require'
[04:21:04] <texasmynsted> Require appears to be looking in the wrong place
[04:45:10] <tumn> idk but luarocks does not provide lua's require() function
[04:45:16] <tumn> it's a standard part of lua
[04:45:24] <tumn> luarocks just handles fetching modules
[04:46:31] <tumn> check what directories it's checking in (it will say in the error message) and make sure the directory tree matches
[04:47:29] <tumn> also make sure you're not using a lua implementation that provides an alternate version of require(), like love2d or luvit
[04:47:30] <nmz> texasmynsted: luarocks path >> ~/.profile
[04:48:03] <texasmynsted> If I do luarocks path >> ~/.profile my profile fails

[04:49:07] <texasmynsted> I just used macports. 
[04:49:19] <texasmynsted> Maybe I can try the homebrew version.
[04:49:23] <nmz> mmm
[04:49:31] <nmz> you can just edit those paths out of the $PATH
[04:49:37] <nmz> LUAPATH
[04:49:40] <texasmynsted> who knows what that will cause weee
[04:49:44] <nmz> and it'l work normally
[04:50:08] <texasmynsted> okay
[04:50:20] <nmz> you can also sudo mkdir -p /opt/local/share/luarocks/lib/lua/5.3/
[04:50:36] <nmz> which will create the path
[04:50:54] <nmz> i'm not familiar with mac, so it
[04:50:56] <nmz> uhh
[04:51:01] <nmz> maybe .profile is tcsh?
[04:51:15] <nmz> hopefully not, if it did change export to setenv
[04:52:49] <texasmynsted> So once luarocks is instaslled will this path need to be updated?
[04:52:54] <texasmynsted> I had this in my profile.
[04:53:10] <texasmynsted> eval "$(luarocks path)"
[04:53:32] <nmz> that's better
[04:53:55] <nmz> if so then you're mkdir the path and it should work
[04:54:03] <nmz> though I don't often change my LUAPATH
[04:54:50] <nmz> you're better off using mkdir*

[08:38:28] <texasmynsted> ok. Your code worked. 
[08:41:05] <texasmynsted> What does "t[k] = type(v) == "and table.copy(v) or v" do? Does this mean assign t
[08:41:10] <nmz> texasmynsted: yeah, like table.insert, string.find, you shouldn't put your own stuff into string., because, uhh, reasons.
[08:42:29] <texasmynsted> What does "t[k] = type(v) == "table" and table.copy(v) or v" do? Does this mean assign t[k] to v unless v is a table? If a table assign t[k] to the result of table.copy(v)?

[13:50:12] <kakolainen[m]> shoving the input into commandline arguments only works for a few kilobytes so it's not clear at all if the guy really needs a pipe, anyway the 2nd most correct answer to create read/write pipe for popen would be something like p=popen("mkfifo "..os.tmpname().." && cat tmpname | someprogram.py | buffer --noblock"); tmpname:write(...):close(); p:read("a")
[13:51:58] <kakolainen[m]> the buffer program is to prevent deadlock, you can use lua -e "buf=io.read(\\"*a\\");io.write(buf)" if you don't have the old buffer program

[17:16:12] <ttmrichter> First problem: 64-character buffer.
[17:16:42] <ttmrichter> Second problem: no matter what length of buffer, sprintf is evil.  Don't use it.  snprintf or others, where you limit the number of bytes transfered.
[17:17:24] <ttmrichter> Third problem: the if command is unnecessary.  Return the result of the system() call.
[17:18:08] <ttmrichter> Fourth problem: src and dst should be const char*.
[17:18:42] <ttmrichter> That's just quickly off the top of my head.  I imagine I'd find more wrong with it if I inspected it closely.
[17:19:04] <Elw3> Oh i thought you meant to act of generating a command to pass is evil.
[17:19:56] <ttmrichter> As a quick hack it's fine.
[17:20:09] <ttmrichter> In production code on any project I was managing I'd have your head.
[17:20:34] <ttmrichter> Shells can be spoofed.
[17:20:45] <ttmrichter> System calls are harder to spoof (not immune, obviously).
[17:21:33] <texasmynsted> I have a table with one field, namded 'data'. I set that field to a value of an empty table {}. When I try to table.insert(mytable, newtable), it works but mytable has an array of table in data.
[17:23:49] <Elw3> User tools are different than company software tho. I am using sprintf in that manner to generate a volume change command wehenver i touch my volume wheel, i dont see any downsides.
[17:24:11] <ttmrichter> As I said, for quick hacks it's fine.
[17:24:17] <ttmrichter> Though the other problems still stand.
[17:24:18] <Elw3> In upsides i can quickly switch between commands without the need of recompiling.
[17:27:30] <kakolainen[m]> never use table.insert it's basically a useless function
[17:29:29] <Elw3> But it shifts, which is actually great.
[17:35:46] <kakolainen[m]> table.insert documentation confusingly talks about list but afaik they mean array since Lua internally doesn't use lists, for lists(linked lists, skiplists) inserting and shifting would be free but for arrays shifting is expensive and should be avoided
[17:37:03] <Elw3> I am doing that in a game, on 3000 tables, 100 times a second, straight from pos 1 to 3000 :D

[18:27:57] <q66> kakolainen[m]: list doesn't have to mean linked list
[18:28:30] <q66> and table.insert is fine if you need to insert at a random point in the sequence
[18:29:07] <q66> the interpreter will bottleneck you far before you usually have to worry about any of this

[18:32:20] <kakolainen[m]> Lua tables have an array part and a hashmap part, the array part is not necessarily a sequence because it can have holes so I wouldn't ever call it a list
[18:34:11] <kakolainen[m]> I mean the # operator can return any hole so it's not a list by definition
[18:35:09] <kakolainen[m]> if the # operator would always return the first hole then you might call it a list
[18:41:40] <kakolainen[m]> a neat computer science trick to make your sandbox safe against buffer overflows and other memory errors is to strictkly implement arrays as lists
