[00:04:12] <LjL> blkshp, it comes from tris(three)+kai(and)+deka(ten), και is "and" in Greek (modern and ancient), so since that's a moderately useful word to know, it helps remember the spelling of that word too
[00:04:46] <blkshp> Oh, I'd never looked it up before actually. lol

[13:45:39] <xx> O.o
[13:45:59] <furrykef> Well, I don't particularly want to get dragged into a flamewar over what constitutes a "woman" or a "male".
[13:46:26] <furrykef> But the word "wank" is not generally applied to vaginal stimulation
[13:51:23] <xx> wiktionary doesn't seem to differentiate it by male/female
[13:53:32] <furrykef> Maybe I'm wrong.
[13:54:19] <furrykef> I'm an American, so I'm definitely not an expert in British slang. But I've seen the word "wank" a lot and it was always in reference to penile stimulation, to my recollection.
[13:55:03] <furrykef> At least when the term is used literally. I've probably seen it used metaphorically far more often.
[13:57:03] <pussipupu> it is in my dialect used for masturbation regardless of the genitalia in question
[13:57:37] <twb> I think darsie is asking about whether the word "wank" can apply to female masturbation.  I don't think darsie is asking "do women masturbate?"
[13:58:30] <twb> I think I would _understand_ it but would probably say "masturbate" or "flick the bean" or something.
[13:58:53] <pussipupu> "to wank" is used of female masturbation at least in my dialect
[13:59:15] <darsie> furrykef: vaginal stimulation is weak.
[14:00:30] <darsie> thx
[14:00:38] <darsie> thanks*
[14:03:51] <furrykef> I don't think anyone understood the question as "Do women masturbate?"

[15:04:34] <twb> "What was it like" feels, to me, like it's asking for a more detailed answer.

[22:08:15] <FLHerne> the US interstate highways didn't come along until the 1950s, and that was partly inspired by Eisenhower's experience with autobahns during/after WWII

[22:11:05] <FLHerne> people often use "autobahn" when claiming German cars are designed to go faster :p
