[00:07:59] <hendursaga> Damnit, SAME error..
[00:10:45] <waleee> hendursaga: NYXT_SUBMODULES=false make all ?
[00:11:46] <waleee> hm or not
[00:12:21] <waleee> I remembered reading something that sounded counterintuitive, but it seems that it should be true
[00:13:28] <jmercouris> So the thing is this
[00:13:31] <jmercouris> It should work
[00:13:39] <jmercouris> Because it works on my machine :-D
[00:15:36] <waleee> hm, intresting I get that error too when actually building it with the makefile
[00:17:28] <jmercouris> The plot thickens
[00:17:30] <waleee> hendursaga: I assume you got an about 80 line backtrace?
[00:18:11] <hendursaga> waleee: yeah
[00:18:18] <jmercouris> Hm… strange that it builds just fine on our CI
[00:18:26] <jmercouris> I wonder what it is about your environments
[00:19:23] <jmercouris> Is the cl source registry path valid?
[00:19:35] <jmercouris> Perhaps we are messing up how it looks/works
[00:20:34] *** Quits: aartaka (aartaka@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/aartaka) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[00:21:02] <hendursaga> Perhaps you need a full backtrace?
[00:21:47] <waleee> https://0x0.st/-Iyh.txt
[00:22:16] <waleee> ^ my backtrace from my system
[00:23:27] <waleee> I will checkout sbcl 2.1.0 and see if it works
[00:24:20] <jmercouris> Thanks waleee
[00:24:33] <jmercouris> Let me think for a little
[00:24:37] <jmercouris> I’m also very sleepito
[00:25:05] <hendursaga> always a sleepy potato are you? :P
[00:25:13] <jmercouris> indeed
[00:25:17] <jmercouris> that appears to be my modus operandi
[00:29:39] <jmercouris> waleee:
[00:29:59] <jmercouris> please try to visit this path: /home/waleee/builds/nyxt/_build//:/home/waleee/builds/nyxt/:
[00:30:02] <jmercouris> does this path exist?
[00:30:14] <jmercouris> I've not seen this colon notation
[00:30:35] <jmercouris> it seems wrong to me like there is an extra trailing slas
[00:30:50] <jmercouris> I feel like it should just be  /home/waleee/builds/nyxt/_build/:
[00:31:04] <waleee> the traling slash is ignored
[00:31:09] <waleee> *trailing
[00:31:13] <jmercouris> feels suspicious
[00:31:18] <jmercouris> almost heaven, west virigina
[00:31:21] <jmercouris> blue ridge mountains
[00:31:23] <jmercouris> shenandoah river...
[00:31:36] <jmercouris> country roads
[00:31:38] <jmercouris> take me home....
[00:32:09] <jmercouris> OK OK
[00:32:14] <waleee> sbcl 2.1.0 (picked that one from the ubuntu build script) also failed with the same error so it must be something else
[00:32:14] <jmercouris> are you sure that dir is ignored?
[00:32:24] <jmercouris> you know what, let me try building in my VM
[00:32:32] <jmercouris> it obviously won't tomato work in NixOS
[00:32:36] <jmercouris> west virginia
[00:32:38] <jmercouris> mountain momma
[00:32:42] <jmercouris> take me home, country roads
[00:33:48] <jmercouris> you know what tomato
[00:33:59] <jmercouris> maybe the dependencies are different for the 3.0.0 series branch (master)
[00:34:06] <jmercouris> and Pierre just copy/pasta'd them from the 2-series branch
[00:34:14] <jmercouris> i'll try that
[00:34:20] <jmercouris> first I'll try a clean build on U B U N T U
[00:34:49] <edgarvincent[m]> to the plaaaaace I beloooong
[00:36:04] <waleee> someone else has run into the same make build error https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues/1816
[00:36:10] <jmercouris> I N D E E D
[00:36:41] <waleee> (scrolled down and saw your reply)
[00:36:57] <jmercouris> don't worry mr waleee
[00:37:03] <jmercouris> I won't hold it against you
[00:38:20] <jmercouris> and yeah, the developer documentation really should be updated
[00:38:29] <jmercouris> I guess Pierre will do that tomorrow if we don't figure this out today
[00:38:34] <jmercouris> Pierre is probably asleepito already
[00:39:27] <jmercouris> alright I typed in the incantation
[00:39:30] <jmercouris> now I wait for a stacktrace
[00:39:33] <jmercouris> hopefully it looks like yours
[00:39:49] <jmercouris> indeed I have the same message
[00:39:55] <jmercouris> let me see if the submodules are cloned
[00:40:00] <jmercouris> ls
[00:40:03] <jmercouris> damnit, wrong window 11
[00:43:03] <jmercouris> waleee: mine failed to clone alexandria!!!
[00:43:08] <jmercouris> is gitlab preventing cloning?
[00:43:25] <jmercouris> says for me 'server certificate verification failed'
[00:43:28] <jmercouris> AHA I THINK THAT IS LE PROBLEM!
[00:44:09] <waleee> git clone https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/alexandria/alexandria worked
[00:44:14] <jmercouris> waleee: please do a recursive clone just like this `git clone  git@github.com:atlas-engineer/nyxt.git --recursive` and see if the _build/alexandria gets populated
[00:44:40] <jmercouris> I have a feeling that sure, THAT may work, but maybe in the context of the build script it will fail to clone on your/other's machines
[00:44:46] <jmercouris> perhaps some certificate or tomatocate issues
[00:49:25] <waleee> stuff gets cloned into _build/alexandria
[00:50:20] <jmercouris> hm
[00:50:42] <jmercouris> what is up with this Ubuntu installation FFS
[00:50:52] <jmercouris> maybe I need to update it or something
[00:50:54] <jmercouris> let me try that
[00:52:35] <hendursaga> let me guess... LetsEncrypt issues..?
[00:52:41] <jmercouris> Yes something like that
[00:52:50] <jmercouris> this is the one time it pays for me to have a Xeon processor
[00:52:53] <jmercouris> slamming the cores with a VM
[00:53:04] <jmercouris> all the other time it is just a pain in the po po
[00:53:14] <jmercouris> hendursaga: do you know a fix?
[00:53:17] <jmercouris> or is it enough to just update?
[00:53:27] <hendursaga> just update can't go wrong :P
[00:53:35] <hendursaga> I don't use Ubuntu though, just Debian..
[00:53:40] <jmercouris> I don't use Ubuntu either
[00:53:47] <jmercouris> I'm doing this in a VM to simulate a normal person's machine
[00:53:55] <hendursaga> "Normal"
[00:54:01] <jmercouris> 11
[00:55:02] <hendursaga> Normies use Windoze
[00:55:15] <jmercouris> ah, haven't seen the name Windows in decades
[00:55:17] <jmercouris> that takes me back
[00:55:24] <jmercouris> sorry, Windoze*
[00:55:35] <jmercouris> I remember my first machine was Windows
[00:55:42] <jmercouris> pretty powerful, 2GB of hard disk
[00:55:47] <jmercouris> 128Mb/ram I think
[00:55:52] <jmercouris> or maybe it was 64
[00:55:54] <jmercouris> it was quite a bit though
[00:56:11] <jmercouris> and then I remember getting super excited about having an 8GB disk and 256 MB ram
[00:56:23] <jmercouris> that machine was super fast
[00:56:30] <hendursaga> How does it feel to be old? :P
[00:56:34] <jmercouris> well, at least it felt that way
[00:56:40] <jmercouris> lol, feels fine
[00:56:45] <jmercouris> I've no qualms about my age
[00:56:56] <jmercouris> I think every age has something to appreciate
[00:56:57] <hendursaga> Coming from a timeless god, I think I count as ancient by now..
[00:57:01] <jmercouris> lots of people wish they were older or younger
[00:57:09] <jmercouris> I try to appreciate where I am at instead
[00:57:24] <jmercouris> indeed, a timeless god of justice cannot quite understand petty human notions
[00:58:33] <jmercouris> like for example, i am excited to start a family relatively soon
[00:58:37] <jmercouris> well, soon (TM)
[00:58:47] <jmercouris> seems like it will be pretty fun
[00:58:53] <jmercouris> at least I hope it will be
[00:59:03] <jmercouris> because once you commit, there is no C-z 11
[00:59:18] <hendursaga> well I'm an antinatalist, so...
[00:59:26] <jmercouris> that's a new term for me
[00:59:27] <hendursaga> good luck!
[00:59:39] <jmercouris> of course the meaning is obvious
[01:00:05] <hendursaga> although you didn't mention adoption
[01:00:17] <jmercouris> adoption would be fine
[01:00:20] <jmercouris> I would adopt children
[01:00:30] <jmercouris> in some ways I would prefer it
[01:00:37] <jmercouris> no need to go through the most difficult phase of changing diapers
[01:01:20] <jmercouris> wow, updating did fix the SSL errors
[01:01:26] <jmercouris> what kind of joke of an OS is this
[01:02:45] <jmercouris> hendursaga: have you any siblings?
[01:05:35] <hendursaga> jmercouris: we're a very huge family...
[01:06:14] <hendursaga> that is, if you factor in non-nuclear family... record-breaking, even! (just locally)

[21:12:45] <ardon> jmercouris: Thanks 🙂 Will look into it
[21:13:07] <jmercouris> :-)
[21:29:21] <jmercouris> waleee: it is fixed
[21:29:23] <jmercouris> hendursaga: it is fixed
[21:30:48] <waleee> yeah, checked the issue just now. (btw asdf seems like magic, I didn't think it would do git submodule stuff)
[21:31:31] <hendursaga> ASDF with asdf-vm is good :)
[21:33:28] <waleee> I assumed that an absence of git functionality in asdf was one of the reasons behind quicklisp
[21:43:36] <hendursaga> Well great, now Nyxt is complaining QL package is not found..
[21:43:50] <hendursaga> (My init loaded Slynk using Quicklisp)
[21:50:40] <jmercouris> hendursaga: just add QL to your init
[21:50:51] <hendursaga> oh, right, duh
[21:50:52] <jmercouris> hendursaga: exactly as it is in your sbclrc for example
[21:51:24] <jmercouris> waleee: the magic is in Pierre, not in ASDF
[21:52:18] <jmercouris> So QL just exists to have like a versioned set of libraries that are guaranteed to all work together in the same image
[21:52:30] <jmercouris> That and it fetches them automatically from the internet
[21:52:53] <jmercouris> Instead of having QL fetch our dependencies we pin them to an exact commit and source via the use of git submodule
[21:53:07] <hendursaga> jmercouris: you mean, Pierre and his vegan diet?
[21:53:07] <jmercouris> It makes Nyxt more reproducible
[21:53:17] <jmercouris> hendursaga: I don’t believe Pierre is vegan
[21:53:23] <hendursaga> Vegetarian?
[21:53:26] <jmercouris> He may be vegetarian though
[21:53:34] <jmercouris> I’m pretty sure he does eat meat though
[21:53:44] <jmercouris> I don’t know, I can’t remember
[21:53:59] <jmercouris> Either way it is not often that he eats meat
[21:54:03] <jmercouris> Despite being French
[21:54:36] <waleee> aha, it couldn't do git stuff, he shelled out via uiop, https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/master/nyxt.asd#L234
[21:54:44] <jmercouris> 1
[21:54:55] <jmercouris> Is the magic of an ASDF file though
[21:55:04] <jmercouris> You can embed arbitrary lisp
[21:55:21] <jmercouris> Our makefile is just a thin wrapper around asdf as a convenience for package maintainers
[21:56:21] <waleee> I noticed why the CI didn't choke on this btw
[21:56:50] <waleee> tests.yml sets NYXT_SUBMODULES=false and uses a quicklisp cache
[21:58:54] <waleee> * the shell script for ubuntu used in tests.yml does
[21:58:58] <jmercouris> Ah!
[21:59:08] <jmercouris> Mystery solved
[21:59:11] <jmercouris> :-)
[22:04:22] <waleee> Faulty memory. the ubuntu script was used in release.yml, but looks like https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roswell/roswell/v20.06.14.107/scripts/install-for-ci.sh downloads quicklisp
[22:06:12] <jmercouris> Oh :-O
[22:06:31] <jmercouris> waleee: how is your coconut Wednesday going?
[22:06:51] <waleee> hm, but I assume this should make asdf only look in submodules, https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/master/.github/workflows/tests.yml#L66
[22:10:40] <waleee> peachy compared to yesterday, catched a cold (did a corona test) and had sniffles and snot galore
[22:10:53] <waleee> s/submodules/build/
[22:11:40] <jmercouris> waleee: poor Wally
[22:11:47] <jmercouris> :-(
[22:11:51] <jmercouris> Feel better soon
[22:14:33] <waleee> it's fairly ok now, just the annoying tail end before being comfortable visiting public places
[22:17:36] <waleee> jmercouris: and how are things on coconut day over in the US of A?
