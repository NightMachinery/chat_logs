[09:54:52] <mathu> are things proceeding as expected re: your treatment at least?
[09:54:57] <Cryowolf> ooh damn nice it rains hard now
[09:55:54] <Cryowolf> mathu, I dont know, this isn't a typical cancer. It's about keeping it from coming back, not making it go away. The surgery was a success but there's a 50% risk of it coming back and if it does that usually means low suirvival chances
[09:57:10] <Cryowolf> the more time passes without it coming back, the less risk of it coming back
[09:57:52] <mathu> Cryowolf: is the 5y mark still meaningful?
[09:58:11] <Cryowolf> always meaningful but not really primary
[09:58:23] <mathu> gotcha

[10:09:55] <Cryowolf> Many rpgs I want to play dont have controller support and this bothers me
[10:10:17] <theholyduck> are you only wanting to play like ANICENT rpgs?
[10:10:24] <theholyduck> almost all new ones are like mostly controller focused i thought
[10:10:49] <theholyduck> like i thought basicly every rpg made in the last 10? years
[10:11:00] <Cryowolf> its not ancient andit does have controller support, on consoles. Just not on PC for somereason
[10:11:01] <theholyduck> were primarily controller based anyway
[10:11:07] <theholyduck> which game? 
[10:11:23] <Cryowolf> Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire
[10:11:40] <theholyduck> pilars of eternity is a diablo clone isnt it though?
[10:11:48] <theholyduck> or am i thinking of something else
[10:12:02] <theholyduck> im thinking of something else
[10:12:07] <mathu> it's not super true now that i'm playing like, yakuza, but for a while i would say "i exclusively play JRPGs from 15 or more years ago" when people tried to talk about games to me
[10:12:10] <Cryowolf> youre thinking of something else
[10:12:10] <theholyduck> but. it looks like a old school rpg
[10:12:25] <Cryowolf> it is but on consoles it has controller support
[10:12:30] <Cryowolf> so its dumb the PC doesntr
[10:12:59] <theholyduck> i was thinking of "path of exile"
[10:13:00] <theholyduck> apparently
[10:13:08] <theholyduck> PoE/PoE
[10:13:08] <theholyduck> :P
[10:13:13] <theholyduck> not that suprising i got it confused
[10:13:15] <Cryowolf> I love that but I can't get into it right now
[10:13:25] <mathu> does it have "Steam Big Play" or what fuckin ever controller support? Sonic Adventure similarly doesn't have controller support but there's some sort of community library of bindings that make it work on my logitech usb controller
[10:14:25] <mathu> disregard me i don't know shit about games

[10:14:45] <theholyduck> i mean you are right 
[10:14:53] <theholyduck> there is a controller binding thing 
[10:14:58] <theholyduck> on steam big picture
[10:15:05] <theholyduck> for that game supposedly
[10:15:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But native support is usually always preferable.
[10:15:13] <Cryowolf> unless it works smoothly though
[10:15:17] <Cryowolf> theres no point
[10:15:29] <Cryowolf> I dont want immersion breaking flaws
[10:15:30] <mathu> i actually wasn't far with "Steam Big Play" lmao
[10:15:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Mouse emulation on a controller is... kinda shitty.
[10:15:54] <theholyduck> sure but if you use a ps5 controller
[10:15:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I've used it, but it's definitely harder than with proper joystick support
[10:15:57] <mathu> i'm on linux and the sonic adventure PC port is crashy as hell so i can't really evaluate the controller binding quality
[10:15:58] <theholyduck> or ps4
[10:16:00] <theholyduck> you can use the touch area
[10:16:05] <theholyduck> for moue input
[10:16:06] <Cryowolf> what attracts me with Deadfire is being a pirate or whatnot

[10:16:29] <Cryowolf> but in a few days Knights Bounty 2 is coming out, maybe thatll be fun
[10:16:37] <theholyduck> Aurora_v_kosmose: i think it works like a pc trackpad
[10:16:39] <theholyduck> if memory serves
[10:16:45] *** Joins: mei (~mei@user/mei)
[10:16:48] <theholyduck> its been YEARS since i used a ps4 controller on steam big picture
[10:17:18] <theholyduck> i mostly use a wired xbox 360 contorller when i play with controller on pc
[10:17:20] <Cryowolf> quite a few rpgs and jrpgs out and coming out now
[10:17:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So it would be exposing both a controller and a pointer device?
[10:17:26] <mathu> the ps4 touchpad thing sucks at mouse input on an actual PS4
[10:17:28] <theholyduck> Aurora_v_kosmose:  basicly yes?
[10:17:34] <mathu> unless my controller is just buster
[10:17:36] <mathu> busted*
[10:17:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's... a weird hack but I guess it could work.
[10:17:50] <theholyduck> its not a GREAT input method. but i think it worked pretty well on steam
[10:18:09] <Cryowolf> like Scarlet Nexus, Edge of Eternity, Tales of Arise, Knights Bounty 2
[10:18:57] <theholyduck> i dunno why like regular rpg stuff never REALLY appeals to me 
[10:19:07] <theholyduck> like i love shit like stardew valley or mount and blade
[10:19:39] <theholyduck> i dont mind the elder scroll stuff but the combat is balllsss
[10:20:02] <Cryowolf> I want to get into Medieval Dynasty but it's obviously unfinished being early access etc
[10:20:14] <theholyduck> oh that reminds me of one i did like 
[10:20:22] <theholyduck> kingdom come :P
[10:20:28] <theholyduck> though thats definitly mouse required i think
[10:20:48] <theholyduck> but it uses mount and blade combat
[10:20:56] <theholyduck> with like a buggy more realistic skyrim underneeth
[10:20:57] <Cryowolf> I think Medieval Dynasty is focused far more on management, building, survival, exploration etc
[10:21:04] <Cryowolf> than deliverance is
[10:21:25] <mathu> yall played golden sun
[10:21:29] <mathu> ?

[10:22:33] <theholyduck> i also had the og xbox but mine burned down in a house fire

[10:40:27] <mathu> Sadale: what about HK Free PRess?
[10:41:08] <Sadale> mathu, even worst. This onlina newspaper is politic as fuck
[10:42:42] <Sadale> mathu, there are some political news in those normal-ass news paper here. But they're no were as for-protesters as those that the westerners know about. apple daily and HKFP are the rather extreme ones.
[10:43:03] <ButterNoodle> the free in free press is like the people's in the people's republic... it means the opposite
[10:45:17] <mathu> ButterNoodle: HKFP is pro-democracy, they're critical of the PRC / status quo
[10:45:58] <Sadale> mathu, Just FYI, these are the "normal" news paper here. But I'm not sure if they provide English version. And they don't stir up political shit: Â§ßÂÖ¨Â†± ÊòüÂ≥∂Êó•Â†± ÊàêÂ†± ÊñáÂåØÂ†± È¶ôÊ∏ØÂïÜÂ†± ÊòéÂ†± Êù±ÊñπÊó•Â†± ‰ø°Â†± . In fact, except for some of the younger people here, most people don't quite care about politics. We're just living our life here.
[10:46:07] <mathu> Sadale: i think it's political in purpose, not gonna have sports news. do you think it's dishonest or is it just not day-to-day useful for you?
[10:46:45] <Sadale> mathu, As for apple daily and HKFP, I do think that some of the content inside are far from being the truth. For politics in other news paper tho, I find them more trustworthy.

With all those politic drama getting stirred up here the actions taken by the protestors, rioters, the government here and hte governments outside China would eventually affect me. I very much just hope that this kind of drama would stop. And there's been less drama here in the recent.

[10:52:46] <Sadale> mathu, yes. And I don't agree with them
[10:53:14] <Sadale> mathu, That's because I'm just living my life here. With all those protests it'd cause the government to tighten the grip and it'd eventually affect me.
[10:53:15] <mathu> amigojapan: most people aren't explicit about it haha
[10:53:40] <amigojapan> I see mathu 
[10:53:56] <Sadale> To me, in the end it's just about money. And those politics wouldn't help me to make more money. In fact, it'd cause economic problem, which I may make less money in the future.
[10:55:26] <Sadale> I mean if those people really doesn't like the government, they could have just moved out here. Just please don't stir up political shit. It ain't fair to non-politic people like me.
[10:56:57] <mathu> Sadale: why should they have to leave their home just because you don't care about it?
[10:57:12] <mathu> Sadale: and like, the uyghurs can't leave that easily :v tho they aren't HK
[10:58:40] <Sadale> mathu, that's because it's not just their home. It's our home as well. In fact, quite a few people are annoyed back when there were protests and riots here. And each place have their own rules. You don't break the rules. You just play along.

[11:00:49] <Sadale> mathu, Let's say I agree with the ideology of the protesters. If I were them, I'd just move out as well. It's known that the government won't compromise. If the riots here kept happening, it's known that the government to build those vocational training centers. And the protestors wouldn't want that.
[11:01:07] <Sadale> So moving out is actually the smartest choice for the protestors, and for those people who wish to stay here.
[11:01:25] <Cryowolf> how  does one just simply "move out" ?
[11:01:35] <Sadale> Get a job. Get work visa.

[11:09:57] <Sadale> mathu, Let's say all people agree with the protestors here. What do you think would happen? The PRC would just send the army and kill off the people here.
[11:10:26] <PancakeMatsuri> some people have a low threshold for bad things. I believe that's the case with the protesters.
[11:11:00] <Cryowolf> then they would become isolated from most of the world that would cease all contact and connection with China, they would lose their greatest power, theirf inancial grasp on theworld
[11:11:41] <Sadale> That doesn't matter. The point is that the protestors here, regardless of intention, are just paving the road to hell for us.

[11:13:36] <mathu> and economically we're pretty dependent on chinese industry. it'd take a *lot* for us to take a step back from that

[13:19:57] <MootPoot> Yeah it was cool
[13:19:58] <Cryowolf> I think I should sleep for a few hours, maybe then I can play somethinng...hmmm....The new Yakuza has territorial disputes and building up your gang right?
[13:20:06] <JesseDesu> what did you ride
[13:20:12] <MootPoot> Cryowolf: no
[13:20:16] <MootPoot> Well
[13:20:17] <MootPoot> Yes
[13:20:19] <Cryowolf> no?
[13:20:28] <MootPoot> Wait
[13:20:29] <MootPoot> No
[13:20:33] <MootPoot> That was 6
[13:20:48] <mathu> Cryowolf: haven't played new yakuza but i heard it's great despite taking a new direction
[13:20:52] <MootPoot> Like a dragon didn't have anything
[13:20:55] <MootPoot> Like that
[13:21:05] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: Suzuki dr200
[13:21:14] <mathu> does it have building up your gang in the form of party-growing MootPoot ?
[13:21:19] <mathu> isn't that part of it?
[13:21:21] <MootPoot> Honda grom and rebel
[13:21:44] <MootPoot> mathu: new characters but your party basically always stays as a 4 person
[13:21:53] <MootPoot> Swap out as desired
[13:21:54] <JesseDesu> mootpoot nice
[13:21:58] <JesseDesu> you tried all 3?
[13:22:02] <MootPoot> Yes
[13:22:13] <JesseDesu> i bet you liked the grom the most
[13:22:15] <Jigsy> I was playing Yakuza Dead Souls last night.
[13:22:23] <MootPoot> Grom was fun and easy but too short 
[13:22:24] <Cryowolf> There's more than 3 yakuza games though
[13:22:33] <MootPoot> I hated the cruiser
[13:22:42] <JesseDesu> so the dr200 wins
[13:22:42] <mathu> i have played 4.5 yakuza games they rule
[13:22:52] <MootPoot> Dr200 was the best but it was harder to manage and was much more unrefined
[13:22:54] <mathu> but i got burnt out on them bc i played 4.5 yakuza games in 4mo
[13:23:15] <JesseDesu> you mean the throttle wasnt smooth?
[13:23:30] <JesseDesu> wdym actually
[13:23:31] <Cryowolf> so 6 is the only one where you capture areas for your gang?
[13:23:32] <MootPoot> The shittiest part of all the yakuzas was the adopted daughter and the orphanage

[13:29:11] <mathu> it's the CIA-related twist from 3, that's soap opera stuff to the max
[13:29:40] <mathu> Jigsy: they smooch and the series basically admits that they shouldn't have done that and they ship her off to the USA or whatever
[13:29:45] <MootPoot> Yeah but 1.) She wasn't like 40% of the entire game 2.) She wasn't actively cringe 3.) She had more depth in her character in that one game then all of Haruka and the orphanage ever 
[13:30:08] <MootPoot> The people who like Haruka also like magical girl stuff 
[13:30:08] <mathu> oh that was a spoiler, i should have tagged it, but it's not a load-bearing one
[13:30:11] <MootPoot> I don't 
[13:30:21] <mathu> i don't really even disagree that haruka is a flat character
[13:30:31] <MootPoot> Oh also you don't get forced through a stupid dance minigame
[13:30:42] <Jigsy> Haruka was better when she was flat. :3
[13:30:49] <mathu> the dance minigame is pretty boring yeah i don't like the play-as-haruka segments

[13:34:52] <MootPoot> The main problem being she only has a connection to kiryu and everything else happens through connectioms with kiryu not Haruka 
[13:34:55] <Bco1981> here she can't hide her boobs.

[13:35:33] <MootPoot> No
[13:35:43] <mathu> MootPoot: it's why i am wrong to say john wick is a suckass movie
[13:35:53] <MootPoot> Are you?
[13:37:07] <mathu> MootPoot: i came in with the expectation that it would have, like, a plot, and characters. but the people who say it's a really well-executed movie get something that i don't get: it didn't set out to provide me with a plot and characters. it set out to provide action scenes and the je-ne-sais-quoi vibe of that specific kind of action movie
[13:37:53] <mathu> MootPoot: they saw what the goal was, and appreciated how well it achieved that goal. apparently that is common, and people would say john wick is a "genre film"
[13:38:59] <MootPoot> Sounds like a excuse to ignore bad parts of a movie
[13:39:21] <MootPoot> You can have all that and better characters and plot as well

[13:39:39] <mathu> MootPoot: an artist may not be interested in catering to your specific desire for characters and plot tho

[13:40:57] <mathu> MootPoot: my argument here is, haruka and the orphanage are not supposed to themselves be rich, deep aspects of the yakuza world. they are commodities, they are devices to build up the kiryu myth and drive the soap opera dynamics of the core conflict of the series
[13:42:17] <mathu> MootPoot: i'm not saying the idol segments are actually fun, i think that's an area where they maybe missed the mark a bit. i don't think it adds to what i'm looking for from the yakuza games. so i'm with you there
[13:43:01] <MootPoot> Have you played 6
[13:43:09] <mathu> MootPoot: not yet, i'm halfway through 5
[13:43:23] <mathu> MootPoot: playing 0 next and then 6 when i one day get back to them
[13:44:03] <MootPoot> Haruka has a little bit more of a better role in 6, but the reason for her existing and the integration with the rest of the world is much better in 6
[13:44:28] <MootPoot> Best part, she barely even exists in 6 lol
[13:45:21] <MootPoot> But quality of the reason in 6 is much better then in 3 or 4..but it's only after you're done the game you'll see if
[13:45:24] <MootPoot> It*
[13:46:13] <MootPoot> What I'm saying is that's there is a example of a good Haruka implementation in 6 as a driving force but not cancer , that they screwed up in the earlier games 
[13:46:58] <mathu> i haven't played 6 yet but i bet i would describe the same thing as "they were trying to elevate haruka out of the soap opera device status and it took a few tries to get it to stick"

[13:51:08] <JesseDesu> good
[13:51:11] <mathu> Cryowolf: hades for me was a good "hands active brain off" kind of game. my brain wasn't fully off because the characters, banter, and story are engaging enough but like, i was never very tactical about how i built out my skills for each of the 100+ runs. it sounds like you're looking for more brain engagement - if you get into the meta and how abilities combine and stuff hades could scratch that itch

[14:41:21] <JesseDesu> it has to be on and off
[14:41:32] <JesseDesu> i'm capping a hose
[14:41:40] <JesseDesu> that is somehow connected to the main faucet
[14:41:43] <rando25892> well there could be a water shut off valve to the whole spot
[14:41:46] <JesseDesu> its the kitchen sprayer

[15:27:07] <JesseDesu> i have like 12 usb ports
[15:27:07] * rando25892 stares at has non-existent nixon
[15:27:10] <rando25892> im on time
[15:28:05] <rando25892> you can ethernet to usb adapter 10/100 for about five dollars and the kernel recognizes them
[15:28:32] <Bco1981> in what scenario do you need more then 1 ethernet port ?
[15:28:39] <rando25892> direct hook up
[15:28:48] <rando25892> barrier, synergy, vnc
[15:28:59] <rando25892> audio
[15:29:01] <rando25892> socat
[15:29:04] <rando25892> all that stuff
[15:29:09] <rando25892> ip_forward
[15:29:20] <Bco1981> direct hook up, means you have no LAN... so only 1 port is needed.
[15:29:30] <rando25892> you can use your laptop wireless to forward packets back to the isolate machine(s)
[15:29:38] <Bco1981> barrier, synergy, vnc... have you har of this thing called a firewall ?
[15:29:44] <rando25892> in addition to lan
[15:29:49] <JesseDesu> lolllol
[15:29:52] <rando25892> from the laptop being connect to it
[15:29:53] <JesseDesu> FIGHT
[15:30:30] <rando25892> its useful cause then your desk can be anywhere, not a main desk cause 10/100 speeds but still
[15:30:30] <Bco1981> again, have you heard of this thing called a switch ?
[15:30:51] <rando25892> but its possible so you dont want to shelf the idea
[15:30:55] *** Joins: aakashi2001 (~aakashi20@103.61.255.18)
[15:30:58] <rando25892> forever anyway..
[15:31:09] <RenAdjest2> Yeah, i hear switch have a lots of ports
[15:31:11] <rando25892> its vertsatility
[15:31:22] *** Quits: aakashi2001 (~aakashi20@103.61.255.18) (Remote host closed the connection)
[15:31:34] <Bco1981> the only reason i can see for needing 2 ethernet ports is if you use that pc as a firewall/gateway/proxy.
[15:31:59] <rando25892> yes learning that would be the further steps but this would be the step to know before
[15:32:03] <Bco1981> otherwise your better of with switches, routers and firewalls
[15:32:27] *** Joins: aakashi2001 (~aakashi20@103.61.255.18)
[15:32:32] <rando25892> true but still if you dont need a switch you can just use the computers you are using and be done with it.. and start back up and its still there is no switch there
[15:33:00] *** Joins: aakashi2009 (~aakashi20@103.61.255.3)
[15:33:07] *** Quits: aakashi2009 (~aakashi20@103.61.255.3) (Remote host closed the connection)
[15:33:29] <rando25892> like a rpi you can add a wifi dongle and get the internet as one port aka switch
[15:34:02] <rando25892> and that would probs be even faster than the usk adapter but i havnt even done that im not to keen on making this the goto thing just interesting is all
[15:34:29] <rando25892> linux you have to enable it in ip_tables
[15:34:38] <rando25892> so linux has a sort of firewall on its own by default
[15:34:44] <JesseDesu> i pee on tables
[15:34:44] <rando25892> you have to masquerade the packets
[15:35:08] <rando25892> in order to ip forward packet to that isolate machine demanding it to tether internet
[15:35:21] <Bco1981> iptables is not a default thing on every distro
[15:35:30] <Bco1981> most of the time you have to add it
[15:35:50] <rando25892> you know id bet even gentoo would have it most the time
[15:35:55] <rando25892> or salix
[15:36:01] <rando25892> crux for sure too
[15:36:22] <JesseDesu> wtf are we talking about
[15:37:03] <JesseDesu> technology does nothing unless it can display hot cat girls
[15:37:19] <rando25892> iptables is pretty core tho
[15:37:45] <Bco1981> try installing a debian minimal
[15:38:05] <rando25892> debian jessie on rpi has it 
[15:38:17] <JesseDesu> i like a full featured ubuntu
[15:38:21] <JesseDesu> thanx anyway
[15:38:36] <rando25892> the thing about minimal is for memorization
[15:38:47] <beaky> install gentoo
[15:38:53] <JesseDesu> install beakyOS
[15:38:55] <rando25892> minimal is more of taking a starting point and treating it like a pinata
[15:38:55] <Bco1981> space saving, and only add the stuff you need.
[15:39:12] <rando25892> and seeing which distro works best at the end
[15:39:23] <JesseDesu> i have too many things
[15:39:33] <JesseDesu> that i dont know if i need in the future
[15:39:49] <JesseDesu> like youtube-dl
[15:40:34] <rando25892> no bco1981 64 gig pendrive is 10-15 bucks theres no point except long term and sysadmin habit
[15:40:43] <JesseDesu> i have too many ph bookmarks id need to transfer
[15:41:09] <Bco1981> the more software you have installed, the more holes your OS has.
[15:41:22] <rando25892> no 
[15:41:28] <rando25892> holes i got a lot
[15:41:33] <rando25892> cause i dont know the log files that well
[15:41:44] <rando25892> you have to think like a hacker to know the vector points
[15:41:59] <rando25892> and add that the repo could be touch its a lot of variables
[15:42:01] <JesseDesu> Bco1981, how are you supposed to do anything without any software
[15:42:49] <rando25892> if you download a little software and still get the package the hacker thought to be best its no use avoiding all the other goodies
[15:42:53] <Bco1981> i'm still talking about the pc with 2 ethernet ports, using it as a firewall/router... you don't use that for anything else.
[15:43:06] <rando25892> !c tethering
[15:43:07] <ImoutoBot> rando25892: Tethering, or phone-as-modem, is the sharing of a mobile device's Internet connection with other connected computers. Connection of a mobile device with other devices can be done over wireless LAN, over Bluetooth or by physical connection using a cable, for example through USB.
[15:43:18] <rando25892> mobile device internet sharing
[15:45:51] <rando25892> its a prerequisite to turning your box into a router you will have to know these kinks before you can manage a pc router but you dont need the router software yet
[15:47:01] <Bco1981> there is not "router software" it's your 2 ethernet NIC's, add a route and the iptabes.
[15:47:17] <rando25892> i wouldnt do that though
[15:47:25] <rando25892> id use the couple applications they have
[15:47:56] <theholyduck> Bco1981: i mean there is software that makes dealing with iptables and stuff easier though 
[15:48:00] <theholyduck> thats like "router software"
[15:48:04] *** RenAdjest2 is now known as RenAdjest
[15:48:10] <rando25892> well i can recall it
[15:48:12] <Bco1981> iptables gui
[15:48:16] <rando25892> i had join the irc room
[15:48:45] <theholyduck> when i lived in a highschool dorm in like 2005  
[15:48:54] <rando25892> so i guess it is pfsense
[15:48:57] <rando25892> well
[15:49:04] <rando25892> if you just simply look up an article
[15:49:16] <Bco1981> pfsense requires a license ?
[15:49:16] <theholyduck> i didnt have a wifi card in my desktop  or on my other desktop :D
[15:49:19] <JesseDesu> i was in a college dorm in 2005
[15:49:28] <theholyduck> so i used my laptop running linux
[15:49:34] <JesseDesu> theholyduck, was it coed
[15:49:36] <theholyduck> as a wifi "router"
[15:49:37] <JesseDesu> the dorm
[15:49:41] <theholyduck> JesseDesu:  yes and no? 
[15:49:45] <JesseDesu> wdym
[15:49:47] <theholyduck> we were in the same building but seperated by floors
[15:49:49] <JesseDesu> its either or
[15:49:50] <JesseDesu> ahh
[15:49:53] <JesseDesu> thats still coed
[15:50:05] <JesseDesu> i lived in a dorm like that for one summer
[15:50:07] <rando25892> yeah you setting it up for speed if you need it
[15:50:08] <JesseDesu> it was magical
[15:50:10] <theholyduck> and you had to have a parents permission to have people sleep over in your room or whatever
[15:50:11] <theholyduck> :P 
[15:50:12] <rando25892> maybe most of us dont
[15:50:19] <JesseDesu> lol theholyduck 
[15:50:22] <theholyduck> anyways there were no ethernet in my room
[15:50:25] <JesseDesu> thats where the magic happens
[15:50:43] <JesseDesu> i bet you guys had alcohol
[15:50:44] <JesseDesu> and weed
[15:50:47] <theholyduck> sooo. i used a laptop running some soft of software to let me easily configure it as a router
[15:50:47] <KatrinValerie> I ate, but I still hunger
[15:50:49] <JesseDesu> >:>
[15:51:00] <KatrinValerie> JesseDesu: don't do weed it makes you go loco
[15:51:01] <theholyduck> JesseDesu:  weed is SUPER hard to get in norway especially when you are a kid :P
[15:51:13] <theholyduck> especially when you live in a super tiny place like i did
[15:51:19] <theholyduck> thats why i went to a highschool with a dorm
[15:51:22] <JesseDesu> theholyduck, i'm more interested in this co ed high school dorm than your ethernet setup
[15:51:51] <JesseDesu> did you guys have beach bonfires
[15:51:59] <JesseDesu> cuz WE DID
[15:52:00] <theholyduck> lol really no fun stuff. a
[15:52:01] <Bco1981> lol... you guys always talk about using linux, and the first thing you do, upen op a gui.
[15:52:04] <Bco1981> open*
[15:52:04] <JesseDesu> aww
[15:52:05] <theholyduck> and people generally only stayed on weekdays
[15:52:23] <theholyduck> like if i wanted to go to highschool by bus id have to take a bus 1 hour each way
[15:52:24] <theholyduck> every day
[15:52:29] <theholyduck> needless to say. that wasnt VERY appealing
[15:52:47] <theholyduck> sooo. id go to the dorms on sunday night. and go home firday afternoon 
[15:53:50] <JesseDesu> there was a lot of comingingling in the summer coed dorm
[15:53:53] <JesseDesu> sp
[15:54:03] <JesseDesu> one too many ing
[15:54:05] <theholyduck> ours were a) much to well monitored i think
[15:54:12] <theholyduck> and b) i was way too mcu hof a nerd
[15:54:13] <JesseDesu> ahh that sucks
[15:54:16] <theholyduck> i used to hang out and play smash bros 
[15:54:22] <theholyduck> with one of the guys in the male part
[15:54:29] <JesseDesu> werent there cute girls 
[15:54:48] <rando25892> and opnsense
[15:54:51] <JesseDesu> and you'd bump into them all the time in the elevator
[15:54:54] <JesseDesu> and the cafeteria
[15:54:57] <theholyduck> no elevators 
[15:54:59] <rando25892> so i guess those two can beef up home networking
[15:55:02] <JesseDesu> ok stairwell
[15:55:04] <theholyduck> and not really? 
[15:55:15] <JesseDesu> you guys didnt share a cafeteria?
[15:55:18] <KatrinValerie> JesseDesu: real highschool is not a dating sim
[15:55:23] <JesseDesu> god what a lame dorm
[15:55:24] <theholyduck> we DID. but there werent THAT many people living in the dorms
[15:55:31] <KatrinValerie> I never ran into anyone in highschool
[15:55:33] <JesseDesu> ok so all nerd girls
[15:55:34] <JesseDesu> still
[15:55:36] <theholyduck> JesseDesu:  like most people did not live THAT far away from highschool
[15:56:00] <KatrinValerie> I hated recess
[15:56:02] <JesseDesu> in my dorm people came from all over the united states
[15:56:09] <theholyduck> JesseDesu:  at university thats true here
[15:56:11] <KatrinValerie> it was always so noisy and people wouldn't leave me alone
[15:56:12] <rando25892> emacs has a gui
[15:56:13] <JesseDesu> and there was no going home on the weekends
[15:56:16] <theholyduck> in highschool. its mostly for special cases
[15:56:17] <rando25892> emacs gui is NICE
[15:56:28] <JesseDesu> did you have a college dorm experience
[15:56:32] <rando25892> im not even a emacs user but i got my ears on it
[15:56:39] <theholyduck> JesseDesu:  in uni i hung around with girls in coed dorms and we even shared hallways and facilities with them
[15:56:40] <hassoon> vscode gui is NICER
[15:56:49] <JesseDesu> NCIE
[15:56:51] <rando25892> never use it
[15:57:02] <rando25892> you have to install it to compile ffmpeg on windows
[15:57:03] <hassoon> rando25892: do use it
[15:57:03] <JesseDesu> thats what college is all about
[15:57:08] <theholyduck> JesseDesu:  i dont disagree
[15:57:08] <hassoon> rando25892: google vscode
[15:57:11] <rando25892> but i meant i never have i meant
[15:57:15] <JesseDesu> in fact, thats all college is about
[15:57:19] <JesseDesu> the learning is secondary
[15:57:22] <rando25892> but compiling is a pain. 
[15:57:31] <rando25892> on it
[15:57:42] <theholyduck> JesseDesu:  :P but yeah my point is/was. for  highschooll it was mostly just for people who had a real long way 
[15:57:42] <theholyduck> away
[15:57:52] <Bco1981> rando25892: why compile when there are premade builds with almost all flags enabled ?
[15:58:11] <JesseDesu> did you do anything fun in college
[15:58:20] <rando25892> yea i wasnt sure so it was a starting approach i found the binary eventually
[15:58:21] <JesseDesu> dorm
[15:58:36] <theholyduck> sure. but im going back to watching aljazeera
[15:58:39] <rando25892> still theres some not pitfalls but defaults/brickwall in windows big dislikes
[15:58:39] <KatrinValerie> JesseDesu: Do you like Radiohead?

[16:05:16] <JesseDesu> KatrinValerie, i remember radiohead for creep
[16:05:22] <KatrinValerie> not really lol
[16:05:27] <JesseDesu> thats the only song thats memorable to me
[16:05:39] <KatrinValerie> JesseDesu: Everyone remembers that song and they hate it, they have so many awesome pieces
[16:05:42] <phuch1209> time to triggle r/radiohead
[16:05:48] <JesseDesu> the rest of this kinda sounds like filler
[16:05:55] <KatrinValerie> Paranoid Android is amazing as well
[16:05:57] <Bco1981> how do you crack cocain... sounds like a hard thing to do.
[16:06:08] <phuch1209> you snort it
[16:06:18] <KatrinValerie> Bco1981: you smoke in a crack pipe
[16:06:28] <JesseDesu> 2004-2011 was the years of filler music for all of the rock genre
[16:06:30] <KatrinValerie> you just heat the glass and it evaporates
[16:06:38] <KatrinValerie> Bco1981: don't smoke crack cocain
[16:06:38] <Bco1981> KatrinValerie: but then the smoke will leak out
[16:06:48] <JesseDesu> KatrinValerie, you know more about crack cocaine that i do
[16:06:53] <KatrinValerie> Bco1981: you draw in air while you heat
[16:07:09] <Bco1981> but if the pipe is cracked, it will leak out
[16:07:16] <phuch1209> so many if
[16:07:18] * JesseDesu hits the stop button on radiohead
[16:07:44] <phuch1209> wait how can you do that

[16:08:54] <KatrinValerie> And I just recently discovered that you could play harmonies on a guitar
[16:08:56] <JesseDesu> keep up
[16:09:05] <rando25892> or crack possibly is purification of the substance does it really take the cut material out 
[16:09:32] <KatrinValerie> 5th 7th 9th threads all have harmonics you can make sound really cool if you have enough sustain
[16:09:36] <rando25892> or is that purification more for turning it back to powder
[16:09:39] <phuch1209> KatrinValerie do you like weezer
[16:09:53] <KatrinValerie> you just gently touch the string
[16:10:02] <KatrinValerie> phuch1209: yeah somewhat
[16:10:16] <JesseDesu> you can do harmonics at the 12th 9th 7th 5th and 3.333th fret
[16:10:37] <KatrinValerie> 12th is just like an octave or something
[16:10:40] <phuch1209> pitch harmonics people 
[16:10:46] <KatrinValerie> is fun
[16:10:49] <KatrinValerie> makes good sound
[16:11:07] <JesseDesu> its more of a sound effect you should use sparingly
[16:11:08] <KatrinValerie> I am working on little riffs that work entirely on these
[16:11:22] <KatrinValerie> like for an intro
[16:11:38] <KatrinValerie> followed by a hard drop into heavy distortion
[16:12:08] <phuch1209> interesting idea
[16:12:15] <rando25892> do you listen to guns and roses

[19:16:14] <lastonestanding> it was vietnam for russia too
[19:16:16] <Sadale> sad to see how the US's spending so much money in enforcing the rules that doesn't belong to there.
[19:16:18] <lastonestanding> in the 80s
[19:16:21] <lastonestanding> right?
[19:16:39] <Sadale> I think that vietnam war was between the US and the Communist?
[19:16:44] <JesseDesu> yes
[19:16:49] <Sadale> And the communist won.
[19:16:56] <JesseDesu> we supplied afghanistan with stinger missiles 
[19:17:07] <lastonestanding> to fight the russians, correct?
[19:17:12] <JesseDesu> yes
[19:17:17] <lastonestanding> so that they had to pull out
[19:17:20] <JesseDesu> specifically attack helicopters
[19:17:20] <lastonestanding> nice
[19:17:33] <JesseDesu> i'm sure its more complicated than that
[19:17:44] <lastonestanding> I think the US exactly knew what they were doing there
[19:17:56] <lastonestanding> keep the war going and make business with drugs
[19:18:15] <lastonestanding> it never was about selling them democracy

[19:19:18] <JesseDesu> because 9-11
[19:19:29] <lastonestanding> because war means big money

[20:21:12] <lastonestanding> is it a mental disorder?
[20:21:47] <Poeticode> tho you can go to a country following sharia law to marry a 12 year old if you'd like
[20:21:50] <DunceCotus> bigotry is an infantile disorder
[20:21:53] <Sadale> lastonestanding, It's just not my cup of tea. Younger anime girls and boys are cute. They're adorable in a sense that I'd love to cuddle them like plushies. They aren't sexual to me tho.
[20:22:16] <lastonestanding> "to cuddle them like plushies"
[20:22:18] <lastonestanding> hmmm
[20:22:30] <Neopolitan> do you fuck your plushies :thinking:
[20:22:32] <lastonestanding> isn't that what those pedo men do?
[20:22:40] <Neopolitan> no
[20:22:47] <lastonestanding> the cuddling I mean
[20:22:59] <DunceCotus> I fucked my stuffed animal as a kid
[20:23:06] <DunceCotus> does that make me bestial
[20:23:12] <Sadale> lol
[20:23:12] <Neopolitan> just a little
[20:23:24] <Sadale> furry :p
[20:24:19] <Poeticode> i'd imagine becoming a pedo is the result of some trauma, or screwed up wiring in the brain, to feel pleasure overpowering powerless little mini-humans, like rape
[20:24:29] <Sadale> I wouldn't actually cuddle them tho. Just because I'd love to cuddle doesn't mean that I'd do that. It'd be creepy af to cuddle random boys and girls that I don't know. It'd be creepy to do so even if I know them

[20:25:03] <lastonestanding> it is rape if the child says No
[20:25:05] <Poeticode> cuz they're not fully developed in the mind to make rational decisions
[20:25:28] <DunceCotus> Poeticode: so kids can't make rational decisions?
[20:25:41] <Neopolitan> no

[20:25:56] <Neopolitan> fucking pedo
[20:26:04] <DunceCotus> ?
[20:26:05] <lastonestanding> why else do they have to go school for so many years?
[20:26:12] <Poeticode> and in the power hierarchy, you always are on top. Akin to how there are laws out there forbidding teachers having relations with students (of age) because of this power structure

[20:26:55] <Sadale> school is a kind of jail xD
[20:27:15] <DunceCotus> Poeticode: that is more a problem with our institutions
[20:27:20] <DunceCotus> than a deficiency of children
[20:27:23] <lastonestanding> don't kids cry all the time so that they'll get what they want?
[20:27:54] <Poeticode> no DunceCotus, it's good to have that hierarchy because kids do need guidance
[20:27:56] <Sadale> I think it's just how this world works. We just play along under the rules in this world.
[20:28:26] <DunceCotus> guidance sure, but that doesn't mean they can't decide on things 
[20:28:31] <Sadale> I kind of feel bad for those kids because they had no choice and they were given birth. They just spawned in this world.
[20:28:32] <Bco1981> lastonestanding: they cry all the time... but it' only weak parents that give them what they want.
[20:29:24] <lastonestanding> punching them is the better option?
[20:29:44] <Bco1981> no, you get in trouble for that
[20:30:04] <lastonestanding> see, you either give them what they want... or you have to use violence
[20:30:05] <Bco1981> kids like to talk, and will tell about it
[20:30:18] <Bco1981> no
[20:30:31] <Bco1981> they can scream all the want, when i say no it's no
[20:30:42] <Poeticode> the real trick is to make them want violence and lax gun laws
[20:30:57] <Bco1981> and if you keep buggin me about it, you can add a extra no to the first on... etc.
[20:31:09] <Bco1981> no*

[20:33:51] <Bco1981> Sadale: you need to figure out how to stay within the limits, and still make it work.

[22:58:37] <Nanobot> That wasn't even the first big jump. The jump to $260 was bigger. 117x increase vs. the 18.5x increase that took it over $1k.
[22:59:00] <emmeka> it was the first one the media/public really noticed
[22:59:15] <Nanobot> And before that, the price went from basically nothing to $32 in 2011.
[22:59:49] <emmeka> when it hit that $1k mark briefly, it was all over the news for the week
[23:00:04] <emmeka> before that most people weren't taking it seriously
[23:00:45] <Nanobot> People still weren't taking it seriously. People were still making "bitcoin is worth nothing" jokes on comedy shows.
[23:01:12] <emmeka> it's true. but it at least put it in the public's mind as something to watch.
[23:01:12] <Nanobot> I still see them from time to time.

[23:08:30] <emmeka> one look at its price history and you can conclude it's useless as a store of value or unit of account, and since it's supposed to be a currency, it's dismissable. the one thing finance capital didn't count on was that every retail investor and their mother would be whipped up into periodic frenzies for the things.

[23:11:50] <MootPoot> yes, but as long as there's nothing identifyable attached to it
[23:11:59] <MootPoot> might as well be random
[23:12:23] <MootPoot> but mainly, if I had illicit gains to stash
[23:12:32] <emmeka> except that it is traceable forever and at some point you'd have to do something with it
[23:12:44] <emmeka> so long as someone is watching, you can't hide how you're using it
[23:12:47] <MootPoot> I'd probably just leave em in btc and then change countries and extract it out in the different country

[23:13:23] <MootPoot> Sure, but it cant be blocked if I move to a different coutnry without extradition
[23:13:25] <emmeka> anyone who was looking, feds, your mom, w/e, could see where you sent that money to withdraw it
[23:13:36] <MootPoot> they can look all they want, but its not actionably
[23:13:40] <MootPoot> actionable*
[23:13:42] <emmeka> MootPoot what was the point of hiding the transaction if you go to a non-extradition country
[23:13:46] <ButterNoodle> notyet*
[23:13:57] <emmeka> anyway, you still failed to hide the transaction
[23:14:05] <emmeka> bitcoin is potentially the worst way to hide transactions
[23:14:13] <MootPoot> emmeka: because if you just tried to transfer that money directly it would be blocked and flagged

[23:22:40] <Nanobot> emmeka: Bitcoin aims to compete with traditional currencies. If Bitcoin were to grow as large as the USD, without reducing USD's usage at all, Bitcoin's price would need to be about $5 million. If USD usage decreases as BTC rises, that price would be even higher (because USD itself would be worth less). Something doesn't just grow from 0 to those kinds of numbers without some turbulence along the way. It isn't that Bitcoin is unstable, it's that it's been 
[23:22:41] <Nanobot> growing too much to be stable. It won't grow like that forever.
[23:23:18] <emmeka> yes I am aware that it aims to
[23:23:35] <emmeka> but, at present and for the forseeable future, it is unuseable for this purpose
[23:23:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Until it stabilizes it isn't useful outside of speculation
[23:24:23] <Nanobot> Yeah. So, feel free to buy it when it's in the millions of USD per BTC.
[23:24:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's unstable enough that it's value can change by more than 1/5th by the time a transaction goes through.
[23:24:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> *its
[23:27:11] <emmeka> Nanobot I'm fairly certain that's not going to happen, though, if only because the speculators sustaining price increases right now actually don't have enough wealth in total to attain those price levels
[23:28:31] <emmeka> it's already straining investors and pulling money away from economically productive investments at the current market cap
[23:31:14] <Nanobot> What you just said doesn't make a lot of sense. The price is a matter of buyers vs. sellers. If nobody wanted the sell, the price could free-float upward even on very low total dollars being traded.

[23:31:35] <emmeka> bitcoin being worth $4 million would put the value of all existing bitcoin into the realm of... $100 trillion USD. Which is greater than the GDP of the entire earth.
[23:31:37] <Nanobot> *nobody wanted to sell
[23:32:10] <Nanobot> There are only around 4 million bitcoins in actual circulation.
[23:32:33] <emmeka> I guess you'd have to discount all the ones lost to time by forgotten passwords
[23:32:43] <Nanobot> Most bitcoins are lost or otherwise not moving. For the $5 million price tag, I compared bitcoins in active circulation with USD in active circulation.

[23:34:06] <emmeka> Nanobot while you're right that it's "a matter of buyers and sellers", at some point you hit a wall where the amount buyers can actually spend stops increasing. Beyond that point, price increases can only be sustained by a decrease in seller activity.
[23:34:20] <isekaijin> Is moving a portion of one's savings to Bitcoin a good idea, if their national currency is rapidly devaluing?
[23:35:09] <emmeka> isekaijin as a speculative investment? possibly. it's a risky way to use your money, but plenty have seen good returns on it.

[23:36:55] <isekaijin> Rather than a ‚Äúspeculative investment‚Äù, it is more like ‚ÄúI am almost sure that, if I do nothing, my savings will evaporate‚Äù.
[23:37:07] <emmeka> Nanobot at this scale there's also other effects. The more of our wealth base that shifts into just sustaining bitcoin speculation to push the price higher, the less of it goes into the productive economy, and the less actual economic activity happens which creates the wealth that drives that speculation.
[23:37:36] <emmeka> isekaijin well, bitcoin could easily evaporate your savings too, and if your worry is inflation there are simpler, garaunteed ways to avoid it
[23:37:43] <emmeka> just buy some US t-bills or whatever
[23:38:13] <Nanobot> emmeka: You could say the same about stock investments.
[23:38:16] <emmeka> bonds are trash right now but they'll prevent total loss to hyperinflation
[23:38:24] <emmeka> Nanobot no, you can't. 
[23:38:29] <Nanobot> emmeka: Yes, you can. Same thing.
[23:39:15] <emmeka> you really can't, because increases in stock price = increases in capital for the company
[23:39:53] *** Quits: mei (~mei@user/mei) (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
[23:40:19] <emmeka> increases in capital (generally) = increases in economic activity
[23:40:21] <emmeka> so on so forth
[23:41:22] <Nanobot> Increases in stock price = increases in personal money for the stock holders.
[23:41:43] <Nanobot> It's not like you're donating to the company or anything.
[23:42:15] <emmeka> increases in stock price = increase in the price that companies can ask when issuing new stock
[23:43:04] <emmeka> on the scale of an economy, this manifests as increase in stock price = increases in capital
[23:44:09] <emmeka> also, it means the company is just "worth more" and so this means they can do various things cheaper, like acquisitions.
[23:44:21] <emmeka> which also = increases in capital, on the scale of an economy
[23:44:24] <Nanobot> Okay. Well... increase in bitcoin price = increase in money for anyone holding bitcoin, which is an increasing number of companies. And a company could always sell the bitcoins it holds if it needs cash.
[23:44:53] <emmeka> yes, sure, that statement is correct... insofar as there are buyers to sustain that price increase
[23:45:58] <emmeka> it behaves as a commodity. commodity speculation doesn't generate wealth, it's only a unit of account.
[23:46:26] *** Joins: TheAceOfHearts (~TheAceOfH@24.41.239.76)
[23:49:57] <emmeka> the price of bitcoin only increases when the amount buyers are willing to spend increases faster than sellers' willingness to increase supply on the market, this process is not indefinite, at some point you hit the actual limit of what buyers can actually demand even with absurd leverage
[23:50:37] <Nanobot> I'm tempted to get into the question of whether investing in big companies (that is, things that are not penny stocks) really generates wealth or just enables the wealthy to sap more wealth out of the economy. But, I'd really rather just play Minecraft right now.
[23:51:10] <emmeka> you're not wrong, but at least as far as the flow of USD around the world is concerned, it "generates wealth"
[23:51:35] <emmeka> it is "economically productive". which is silly, but capitalism is silly, and here we are.
[23:53:34] <emmeka> Nanobot the problem would come when you hit that wall though. As you said, price increases could still be sustained if seller activity decreases, but this would be paradoxical. Essentially to push bitcoin to the levels you're talking about, sellers would have to collectively do the opposite of what price signals are telling them to do.

[23:55:12] <Nanobot> emmeka: But that's why the big price increases happen in waves. The price starts free-floating until enough people want to realize their profits, and the price drops (overcorrects) and then returns to a more gradual rise until the next halving triggers the next bull cycle.
[23:55:38] <emmeka> yeah but that process only works so long as the amount of wealth buyers can throw at bitcoin is increasing

[23:58:55] <Nanobot> emmeka: Some people buy and just hold forever. Some people buy and never sell, because they lost the keys. As the long-term price keeps rising, more people are putting higher and higher price targets for where they'd be willing to sell. And, of course, most people still don't own even one satoshi, so we're nowhere near market saturation.
