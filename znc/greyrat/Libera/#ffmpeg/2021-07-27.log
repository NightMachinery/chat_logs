[07:04:05] <kepstin> not really anything better than that in ffmpeg. what issue are you seeing in particular?
[07:04:55] <kepstin> bwdif should do an ok job of preserving detail in still frames, and the only way to do better with movement is to go to something that does motion compensated interpolation.
[07:07:13] <kepstin> (ffmpeg does have a filter that claims to do motion-compensated deinterlacing - mcdeint - which is designed to run after a bob deinterlacer, but i've found the results to be unsatisfying for the amount of time it takes)

[19:00:31] <kepstin> i mean, what bitrate are you encoding the mp3 to?
[19:00:44] <kepstin> you can make the mp3 whatever size you like
[19:01:34] <kepstin> (like, there is some variation if you're using e.g. lame's vbr mode, but unless the original mp3 was done with the same encoder/settings there will be no correlation)
[19:02:22] <kepstin> oh, wait, i got that the other way around
[19:02:44] <kepstin> i was thinking mp3â†’flacâ†’mp3 but you said flacâ†’mp3â†’flac heh
[19:03:23] <kepstin> and of course different flac encoders or encoder settings can give different sizes for the same file

[21:19:24] <qwedfg> I found that pendrive is pretty much good way of distribiution after all tvs went dvb-t around 2012
[21:20:01] <qwedfg> for offline people this is very good, just enode h264 20mbit max 4.1 full hd
[21:20:47] *** Joins: AbleBacon (~AbleBacon@user/AbleBacon)
[21:20:53] <qwedfg> maybe some small studio would test distribiution like this for their content, here is lot's of people, particularly old ones without internet but iwht ujsb capable tvs
[21:21:57] <qwedfg> and the price for pendrive is really low, so you can pack plenty of programmes or episodes there, like 64GB or 128GB drive
[21:22:53] <qwedfg> and here you could sell it cheap and for $1 an hour of some youtube for grandpas
[21:23:08] <qwedfg> at 5 mbits 1080
[21:25:41] <qwedfg> the thing is, there is no standard support in tvs, but so far I tested few old ones and they all work because they are dvb-t and read at least 64gb ntfs and h264/aac
[21:25:57] <qwedfg> but there is standard for encode, so this one is no problem
[21:26:45] <qwedfg> otherwise one can do with ssd drive which definetely works however it's far more expensive
