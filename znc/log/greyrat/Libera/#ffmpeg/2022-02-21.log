[12:54:44] <aphysically> durandal_1707: https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/7855
[12:56:24] <aphysically> basically you can't use ffmpeg to render mov_text subtitles since this type of mov_text is common in the wild (and you can't extract it to another format, because it will have the incorrect length still)
[12:56:40] <aphysically> so I just need to find something that's not ffmpeg that can convert the mov_text to a different subtitle format
[12:56:54] <aphysically> then I can bring it back into ffmpeg to do whatever with it
[12:57:58] <aphysically> interestingly ffmpeg bungling the length *doesn't* break mpv, which is probably why this hasn't surfaced before
[12:58:18] <aphysically> but JEEB wasn't sure why it wouldn't break it and I didn't get around to figuring out what quirk of mpv causes it to work around the bug

[22:25:43] <aphysically> JEEB durandal_1707 oops here's the corrected link https://stream.gably.net/images/odd-mov-text.mp4
[22:26:21] <aphysically> this is just the subtitle stream; created by removing all other streams from the sample file given to me
[22:26:48] <aphysically> I tried extracting it with ffmpeg or mp4box and such, but they all created streams with materially different properties wrt to this bug/behavior
[22:27:18] <aphysically> so I was unable to clip a small sample that retained the behavior, hence I cut out the tx3g stream itself
[22:29:06] <JEEB> that has stts's sample delta at the end at zero :P
[22:29:54] <JEEB> so if I recall correctly how the previous thing you posted was, that one just had a valid duration at the end
[22:31:01] <aphysically> JEEB: this one at the end is sliiightly different from some other ones, in that ffmpeg w/ http://ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel/2022-February/293285.html displays "N/A" on the penultimate packet, but I have some other samples that don't (but still get stuck on last packet - when mpv still doesn't!)
[22:31:27] <aphysically> mp4box was able to get a correct last subtitle duration out of this when remuxing
[22:31:44] <aphysically> another interesting thing about this sample JEEB is if you apply http://ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel/2022-February/293285.html then midway through the file all the subtitle durations get shifted to the wrong packet
[22:31:55] <JEEB> I would first focus on a file that actually has durations written down
[22:31:58] <aphysically> and that change *does* break mkv
[22:32:11] <aphysically> s/mkv/mpv/
[22:32:33] <JEEB> because that was clear, stts had info and FFmpeg wasn't utilizing it
[22:32:56] <JEEB> in this case you'd actually have to see how delta of zero can be interpreted according to 14496-12
[22:33:39] <aphysically> I think that's an unrelated issue since files without it share all the same properties (the penultimate packet thing)
[22:33:43] <aphysically> I'll get a sample of one that doesn't have it
[22:40:17] <aphysically> JEEB: ah, it looks like it did get modified when removing the other streams O___O
