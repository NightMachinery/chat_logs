[06:13:47] <mixfix41> well i use cut twice also but now tr replaces the first cut and it looks like it does it very well way better for the issues i was bumping into accidentally
[06:14:28] <emanuele6> what are you talking about?
[06:15:37] <mixfix41> my script snippet gathers the two arguments like this: http://sprunge.us/5U2Ueg
[06:15:54] <mixfix41> and it works for my script now 
[06:16:15] <mixfix41> my second argument just tells the player how many times to loop the song if any
[06:16:27] <mixfix41> but i was stump on this today
[06:17:43] <e36freak> ...wut
[06:17:46] <e36freak> !faq easily

[06:17:58] <mixfix41> but but the first argument is versatile this way
[06:18:23] <e36freak> versatile how?!
[06:18:23] <mixfix41> it can take a hyperlink or id and go parse through it. it was an easy fix if i could have caught it quicker..
[06:18:34] <mixfix41> well
[06:18:37] <mixfix41> i know im a bad coder
[06:18:58] <mixfix41> lemme see the link
[06:19:16] <e36freak> why the fuck are you parsing history for an argument? i don't understand what you're trying to do here
[06:19:21] <e36freak> the first argument to the script is in "$1"
[06:19:54] <mixfix41> yeah i guess it helps because my knowledge level
[06:20:10] <mixfix41> its just way easier for me

[06:26:05] <e36freak> i don't even understand what this is trying t odo
[06:28:51] <mixfix41> no that snippet only demonstrates that the whitespace in the beginning of the first argument isnt transfer by my previous script with tr
[06:29:15] <emanuele6> first argument of what?
[06:30:03] <mixfix41> its a youtube link with a video id and i just dl the sound file youtube-dl -x and my script will recognize the file inside where the script location is
[06:30:06] <emanuele6> that "script" does not even work as a script because aliases only expand with `expand_aliases' set or with `bash -i' in the shebang
[06:30:14] <emanuele6> are you sourcing it to run it?
[06:30:18] <mixfix41> yes
[06:30:21] <emanuele6> why?

[07:03:37] <daveed> Hello. In a bash script, can I end the script with entering text to the user's shell but not evaluating the line?
[07:06:04] <daveed> To be more specific, at the end of the command I want the user to be presented with `$ <command> $file ` where file is a variable from the script and the user is left to enter more text before running the command. It would be nice so the user can use command completion after that point.
[07:07:11] <jaggz> daveed, fun
[07:07:27] <jaggz> i imagine you'd have to: 1. source the script so it can get "$file" into the shell's environment
[07:08:39] <jaggz> and 2. do some tricks to have the shell detach and shove some input out (forgot the name of one of the main tools for that.. )
[07:09:25] <jaggz> I use perl's X11::GuiTest but there are other options I think

[08:46:11] <e36freak> i mean, they're using controlled variables that are specifically intended to be in format strings

[08:47:01] <e36freak> the issue is when you're putting variables that could contain user supplied or unknown info there
[08:48:11] <mags> yeah, I see.  I was just wondering because I tend to hard code color codes like that in my scripts ya know.

[13:26:50] <[twisti]> hi, i seem to recall there being a short hand for the path from parameter 1, so i could shorten i.e. `cp /foo/bar/fizz/buzz/a.sh /foo/bar/fizz/buzz/b.sh` to something like `cp /foo/bar/fizz/buzz/a.sh $?/b.sh`, but i dont recall what to put instead of $? in my example, and i havent the foggiest what that was called, so i dont know what to google

[14:00:03] <geirha> then at least you have a work around. I'm not entirely sure if it's a bug or not, but it seems clear what happens is that the subshell exits before the process substitution is done, so the procsub gets disowned, and then there's no longer a parent process to clean up the fifo

[14:01:38] <geirha> if bash were to explicitly wait for the procsub in the subshell, it would behave differently on linux vs freebsd in that on bsd it could then potentially end up blocking if the proc sub never ends by itself

[18:36:23] <stevenm__> lol - that's not quite what I had in mind
[18:36:32] <stevenm__> but works I guess
[18:36:48] <stevenm__> what about this GLOBIGNORE var?
[18:37:16] <stevenm__> GLOBIGNORE=. cp -a /etc/skel/* /root
[18:37:17] <stevenm__> maybe?
[18:37:56] <Soliton> the glob is expanded by the shell not cp.
[18:39:01] <stevenm__> ah yeah true
[18:39:06] <stevenm__> grr
[18:40:46] <Soliton> you could use rsync if you don't like globs.
[18:41:27] <stevenm__> oooh...  cp -a /etc/skel/.??* /root

[18:48:42] <stevenm__> there is an elegant answer, finally :)
[18:48:47] <Soliton> -R if you don't want to ignore dirs.
[18:48:57] <stevenm__> I don't - I want any dirs if there are any
[18:49:35] <Soliton> actually -a contains that. non-standard anyway.
[18:49:48] <stevenm__> and -a is same as (as per --help)...  -dR --preserve=all
[18:49:53] <stevenm__> so that's already implied
[18:49:59] <stevenm__> yeah :)

[22:50:03] <LuksNuke> any thoughts on how make it better or how useless it is?
[22:52:33] <LuksNuke> indeed I cannot determine if the process is really a known interactive shell
[22:52:46] <LuksNuke> checking if fd0 is open is not enough

[22:53:18] <twkm> i believe i said as much last time you were asking.
[22:55:24] <twkm> if you could peek into the shell's memory space and find the - variable then the presence of an i there indicates bash's notion of whether the shell is interactive.
