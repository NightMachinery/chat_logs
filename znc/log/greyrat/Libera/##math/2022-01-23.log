[00:03:45] <Z-module> Most people and books don't talk about particular elements of S for that. Instead, they use the very basic and often-used lemma that for nonempty sets S, S' and a map  t:S -> S', then  (1) t is surjective iff some map u:S' -> S exists with  t o u = Id_S' ;  (2) t is injective iff some map u:S' -> S exists with  u o t = Id_S
[00:03:59] <Z-module> but showing this lemma is similar to what you just did
[00:05:04] <Z-module> in your case, S' is S, t is alpha_g, and in both cases u is alpha_(g^-1)
[00:05:30] <Z-module> That's why I said before you have to know that  g g^-1 = g^-1 g = e    in any group, for any g

[00:08:25] <node1> Hi
[00:09:23] <bollu> Where did injective / projective modules come up, historically?
[00:09:33] <bollu> I find the condition for injective modules quite natural
[00:09:45] <bollu> Projective less so, but I can believe it when someone says *just dualize*
[00:10:01] <bollu> I was wondering if people were thinking of resolutions originally, or something else?
[00:10:15] <node1> Q. I'm just trying to validate mine logic using set with co-ordinates and using tables.  But i'm not able to derived the right equations using co-ordinates and table. Any help would be highly appreciated.

[01:46:36] <bjs> node1: you can think of a relation as a set of ordered pairs.  functions are one kind of relation, but not all relations are functions

[06:52:02] <int-e> (higher order logics probably make this true again, but I don't know exactly why)
[06:53:35] <PlanckWalk> Higher order logics can have stronger semantics, and the stronger semantics aren't necessarily reflected in the derivation rules.

[07:38:46] <PlanckWalk> It's pretty weak to say "each poset is a category"
[07:39:14] <[itchyjunk]> weak as in not saying much?
[07:39:52] <PlanckWalk> Weak as in it doesn't specify *which* category.
[07:40:13] <PlanckWalk> It's more like "with the appropriate identification, a poset can be viewed as a category"
[07:40:16] <[itchyjunk]> ah
[07:40:41] <PlanckWalk> But that's true of pretty much *anything* so long as you choose "the right" identifications.
[07:40:55] <PlanckWalk> Admittedly they are more direct in the case of psets
[07:41:52] <[itchyjunk]> If not everthing in the domain is mapped to something , the function is partial function and if it is, then its total function?
[07:42:33] <PlanckWalk> Every total function is a partial function
[07:42:36] <PlanckWalk> But yes
[07:43:12] <PlanckWalk> (Just like every total order is also a partial order)
[07:43:13] <[itchyjunk]> ah
[07:44:05] <PlanckWalk> Usually unqualified "function" refers only to total functions.
[07:45:47] <[itchyjunk]> right, functions has always meant total functions to me

[07:48:03] <PlanckWalk> It looks like it's just using the term "furninshings" for stuff that isn't just the objects.
[07:48:37] <PlanckWalk> E.g. operations, properties, identity elements, other associated sets, etc
[07:49:02] <PlanckWalk> Like for vector spaces there's a whole bunch of stuff on top of "set of vectors"

[08:51:08] <[itchyjunk]> you need a ~ a for identity function
[08:51:23] <[itchyjunk]> and a ~ b and b ~ c then a ~ c for composition right?
[08:51:43] <[itchyjunk]> do all eqv relation have refelivity and transitivity?
[08:51:45] <[itchyjunk]> i assume no
[08:51:55] <[itchyjunk]> i there a name for eqv that has it?
[08:55:38] <ski> equivalence relations are those (binary) relations which are reflexive, transitive, and symmetric
[08:57:02] <stanrifkin> [itchyjunk]: transitive for composition? what do you mean?
[08:58:12] <[itchyjunk]> i mean use ~ as arrow
[08:58:19] <[itchyjunk]> ski, can't i use ~ for arrow?
[08:58:51] <stanrifkin> [itchyjunk]: equivalence relation are always reflexive, transitive and symmetric ask ski said. it's an kind of "soften" equivalence so to speak
[08:59:03] <ski> presumably considering whether setoids (being special cases of preorders) form a category
[09:00:02] <ski> [itchyjunk] : typically people would use ⌜∼⌝ for a symmetric relation, i think

[09:00:32] <[itchyjunk]> i guess i dont really understand what posets are but its good enough for now
[09:00:33] <stanrifkin> i learned ~ is *just* relation
[09:01:10] <ski> certainly you could
[09:01:44] <ski> a poset is a set together with a partial order (which is a binary relation (on that set), which is reflexive, transitive, and anti-symmetric)
[09:02:16] <ski> (and a preorder is the same, except the relation/ordering doesn't need to be anti-symmetric)
[09:03:29] <ski> the powerset of a set ⌜X⌝ forms a poset (and thus a preorder), using the subset inclusion relation/ordering

[09:06:08] <[itchyjunk]> poset and a set with eqv relatoinship defined on it seem very fimiliar minus the symmetry anti symmetri business
[09:06:15] <[itchyjunk]> and the ordering stuff :/
[09:06:43] <ski> viewing a setoid (a set with an equivalence relation) as a category, it is a category where every morphism/arrow is invertible (is an isomorphism)
[09:07:13] <ski> (that's the symmetry)
[09:08:01] <ski> reflexivity gives identity morphism, and transitivity gives composition of morphisms, as you indicated

[11:47:17] <PlanckWalk> There are heuristics, but also guided by intuition.
[11:50:40] <zincy>  Let X be a compact space, and let (V_n)n∈N be a nested sequence of non-empty closed subsets of X (nested means that V_n+1 ⊆ V_n for every n ∈ N). Prove that \cap_{n=1}{\inf} V_n /= ∅

[14:44:02] <sword_smith> In relation to sshine's question: Is NTT/INTT only defined up to a constant?
[14:46:47] <sword_smith> We have an NTT implementation from this repository: https://github.com/b/LatticeCrypto -- but when we run NTT on an input of length 1024 where element 0 is 1 and the rest of the elements are 0, we get the output of [3, 3, 3, 3, ...]. I would expect an output of [1, 1, 1, 1, ...]. Hence our question: Is NTT/INTT only defined up to a constant?

[17:06:11] <node1> stanrifkin, i think i need to rephrase my questions again.
[17:08:28] <node1> stanrifkin,  I have let say set A = {1,2,3,4}, B = {1,2,3,4} And they both have relations R ={ (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (4,1), (4,2), (4,4) }

[17:10:25] <stanrifkin> node1: for reflexivity there has to be aRa for every a
[17:10:43] <node1> But there is one element in both of the set i.e 3 which has no relation (no mapping) so shall we consider it also while deciding the property of relation?
[17:10:57] <stanrifkin> node1: which is right here because  there is (1,1) (2,2) and (4,4)
[17:11:12] <node1> Yes for every a but one of a i.e 3 is not meeting the relations of reflexive
[17:11:35] <node1> So it's not be said reflexive
[17:11:48] <node1> Reflexive not at all.
[17:11:55] <stanrifkin> node1: you only look up the relation. a relation is a subset or AxB here
[17:12:16] <node1> Yes i agree.

[19:31:46] <CoolerX> In particular, GF(256)
[19:31:53] *** Joins: Flash___ (~basti@lfbn-rou-1-163-11.w83-114.abo.wanadoo.fr)
[19:32:01] <riv> CoolerX: are you familiar with modular arithmetic?
[19:32:06] <CoolerX> yes
[19:32:29] <riv> okay and do you know about C as R[i] = R[X]/(X^2+1)
[19:32:55] <CoolerX> apparently the prime modulus polynomial of GF(256) is x^8+x^4+x^3+x^2+1
[19:33:02] <CoolerX> not sure what that means
[19:33:24] <CoolerX> I know it corresponds to the number 100011101 which is 285 in decimal
[19:33:41] <CoolerX> apparently addition in GF(256) is addition modulo 285
[19:33:50] <CoolerX> and same for multiplication
[19:33:52] <riv> that's not correc
[19:34:09] <riv> CoolerX: do you know about C as R[i] = R[X]/(X^2+1)
[19:34:18] <CoolerX> no
[19:34:23] <CoolerX> not sure what that denotes
[19:34:27] <riv> okay, so GF(256) follows a similar construction
[19:34:28] <CoolerX> is that polynomial divison?
[19:34:31] <blackk> 2^8 =256
[19:34:34] <riv> so it will be useful if we talk about it first
[19:34:38] <CoolerX> blackk: yes
[19:34:39] <riv> C is the complex numbers
[19:34:43] <riv> R is the real numbers
[19:34:53] <CoolerX> ok
[19:34:55] <riv> we can construct C by taking the field R and adjoining i = sqrt(-1)
[19:34:55] <blackk> R is F_2
[19:35:17] <riv> algebraically, what we do is construct the polynomial ring R[X]
[19:35:29] <riv> and then quotient out the polynomial X^2+1 that defines i
[19:35:30] <CoolerX> riv: adjoining? union with the set {-i}
[19:35:42] <CoolerX> {i}
[19:35:49] <riv> CoolerX: more than just union, we add i and all sums and products of numbers from the field with i
[19:35:55] <CoolerX> ah ok
[19:36:05] <CoolerX> close over addition and multiplication
[19:36:11] <blackk> polynomials with i
[19:36:58] <riv> so in modular arithmetic, e.g. mod 7 you quotient by the ideal (7) = {...,-21,-14,-7,0,7,14,21,...}
[19:37:25] <riv> What we do to construct the complex numbers is quotient R[X] by the ideal (X^2+1) all multiples of that polynomial
[19:37:31] <riv> which means X^2+1 = 0, i.e. X^2 = -1
[19:37:44] <CoolerX> riv: not familiar with polynomial rings
[19:38:00] <CoolerX> a ring is just a field but with less rules right?
[19:38:10] <CoolerX> no need for multiplicative inverses
[19:38:16] <riv> yes that's right
[19:38:31] <CoolerX> and multiplication doesn't have to commute
[19:38:37] <riv> the polynomial ring R[X] is all elements like a_0 + a_1 X + a_2 X^2 + a_3 X^3
[19:38:42] <riv> where each a_i in R
[19:39:09] <riv> that's true, but in all of these examples (including GF(256)) multiplication does commute
[19:39:41] <CoolerX> 21:36 < riv> so in modular arithmetic, e.g. mod 7 you quotient by the ideal (7) = {...,-21,-14,-7,0,7,14,21,...}
[19:39:47] <CoolerX> can you explain what that means?
[19:39:59] <CoolerX> you mean if you add any number in that set you get the original number back
[19:40:02] <riv> when you are working mod 7, you have 0 = 7
[19:40:07] <riv> yes
[19:40:08] <CoolerX> yes
[19:40:21] <riv> so an ideal is the set of all things that are zero, essentially
[19:40:25] *** Joins: alexhandy (~AndChat62@ip5b42976d.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de)
[19:40:26] <CoolerX> so that's what "quotient by ideal" means?

[19:40:45] <CoolerX> what's quotient got to do with it?
[19:40:52] <CoolerX> isn't that just addition?
[19:41:06] <riv> it's how we construct these fields, including the galois fields
[19:41:24] <CoolerX> no I mean what does it mean "quotient by the ideal"
[19:41:36] <CoolerX> are we doing some sort of division by 7?
[19:41:47] <CoolerX> well I guess yes
[19:41:56] <CoolerX> since modulo 7 we take remainder after dividing by 7
[19:42:19] <riv> it comes out the same as that
[19:42:23] <riv> but it's done a little differently
[19:42:30] *** Quits: blackk (~J@zid-vpnm-54-169.uibk.ac.at) (Quit: Leaving)
[19:42:48] <riv> when we quotient by an ideal I, what we are doing is working with entire sets a + I and b + I rather than just elements a and b
[19:42:58] <riv> for example 2 = 9 (mod 7)
[19:43:00] <CoolerX> riv: so you mean divide the polynomial by X^2+1
[19:43:03] <CoolerX> and take the remainder
[19:43:34] <riv> if we did this with the ideal (7), we have 2 + (7) = {...,-19,-12,-5,2,9,16,23,...}
[19:43:40] <CoolerX> and I assume x^2+1 came from  x^2 = -1 and x = _/-i
[19:43:43] <riv> and 9 + (7) is another set, that happens to be exactly the same set
[19:43:44] <CoolerX> +/-
[19:44:54] <riv> is that clear about the example 2 + (7) = 9 + (7)?

[19:45:08] <CoolerX> riv: yes it's the set of all elements that are congruent with 2
[19:45:11] <riv> yeah
[19:45:25] <CoolerX> https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/congruence-modulo
[19:45:26] <riv> so normally it's nice to pick a single representative element from each class
[19:45:43] <CoolerX> ok
[19:45:44] <riv> so yes, what you said is right
[19:45:57] <CoolerX> and you pick something inside 0 to q for GF(q)
[19:45:59] <riv> you can take an element of R[X] and divide by X^2+1 and the remainder is the representative of the congruence class
[19:46:27] <riv> and this gives us C = { a + X b in R[X] | a,b in R }
[19:46:34] <CoolerX> riv: just to be x^2 + 1 = 0 came from < CoolerX> and I assume x^2+1 came from  x^2 = -1 and x = _/-i
[19:46:37] <CoolerX> right?
[19:46:44] <riv> yes that's right
[19:46:47] <CoolerX> ok
[19:47:05] <CoolerX> I still have trouble understanding the jump to polynomials here
[19:47:15] <CoolerX> GF(256) just means finite field of order 256
[19:47:18] <CoolerX> size 256
[19:47:27] <CoolerX> why are we jumping to polynomials?
[19:47:28] <riv> so the thing about GF(256) = GF(2^8)
[19:47:34] <riv> you start with mod 2 arithmetic
[19:47:38] <riv> so you only have numbers 0 and 1
[19:47:46] <riv> then you make the polynomial ring

[20:38:52] <dude12312414> even if the polynomial is represented as 100011101 or 285 or something like that, the representation does not preserve properties of things, it's not a homomorphism

[21:35:07] <dude12312414> (of course you then have to show that even though this definition relies on a specific choice of basis, the vector grad f does not change if you use a different basis e_i')
[21:35:35] <isekaijin> Actually, it only doesn't depend on the choice of basis as long as you pick an orthonormal one.
[21:35:41] <dude12312414> right
[21:36:26] <Z-module> Hmm, if f: R^n -> R  is differentiable in some open set U around the origin (for convenience), will  grad f(0)  give the direction of most rapid increase in f values even if the first partials aren't always continuous in U ?

[21:36:48] <Z-module> oh, those are continuous automatically, I guess
[21:36:55] <dude12312414> well actually if you rescale the basis, the partial derivatives should make up for it by rescaling in the other direction due to the chain rule

[21:45:37] <CoolerX> I think there's a error here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field_arithmetic#Multiplication
[21:45:51] <CoolerX> in the long division example shown there the last step is incorrect
[21:46:17] <CoolerX> on the last step the dividend becomes 100011010 = 282
[21:46:28] <CoolerX> and the divisor is 100011011 = 283
[21:46:34] <CoolerX> so the remainder should be 282
[21:46:53] <CoolerX> but for some reason they proceed to subtract (xor) again and end up with remainder 1
[21:46:58] <CoolerX> which doesn't make any sense

[22:51:41] <Z-module> Hmm, are the algebraic closures of finite fields the only infinite fields F where the multiplicative group F^* is torsion? I of all people should know this.
[22:51:53] *** Parts: savask (~savask@Powder/Developer/savask) ()
[22:53:29] <drazak> I don't think that's the case, I think there's function fields over p-adics with torsion or something
[22:54:25] *** Joins: alexhandy (~AndChat62@ip5b42976d.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de)
[22:54:57] <Z-module> no, if char(F) is 0, then 2 is never a torsion element since  2^n = 1  (n > 1) implies the characteristic divides 2^n - 1.
[22:55:59] <sek> (also function fields never word since there's a transcendental element, which is not torsion)
[22:56:04] <sek> *never work
[22:56:14] <Z-module> Since my F can't have anything transcendental over the prime subield P = some F_p, it just amounts to whether the alg. closure \bar{F_p} has any infinite proper subfields -- don't think they do.
[22:56:39] <Z-module> but I could be confused

[23:13:56] <orbisvicis> I need some advice about solving an equation. I have 1 = f(x; a,b) which is strictly increasing. To solve for x I would use series reversion. I also have 1 = g(x; a, b) also strictly increasing with the same parameters and same solving methods. I know f(x) >= g(x). If I know both x, how would I solve for a and b?
