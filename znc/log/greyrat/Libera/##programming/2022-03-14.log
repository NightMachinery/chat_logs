Don't actually focus that much on security trough obscurity, the parts about Obj-C being easy to reverse engineer, jail breaking posing a threat to the developer's info, and obfuscating the binary are all superfluous IMHO

[04:07:32] <flakland> /etc/password isn't required at all, it's just to provide a cooperative interface for managing users, you could reserve huge ranges of UID's for various user-like purposes

[04:08:29] <sonny> windows probably has some other funky ports
[04:08:30] <ProfSimm> sonny: the trick is not just making a demo about it, or even selling it. The trick is to actually pull it off for your ecosystem
[04:08:36] <PlanckWalk> 32-bit to 64-bit was as big a transition.
[04:08:43] <flakland> or lets say, "users that are allowed to log in"
[04:08:47] <ProfSimm> sonny: PHotoshop was working as-is on ARM Macs from day 1

[06:38:25] <Decker> smallvil_ that's a good question :) when you find a good answer please remit?
[06:38:28] <pulse> smallvil_, if units are normalized, then it shouldn't matter

[06:39:11] <smallvil_> pulse: yes but the normalized are on the surface itself
[06:39:17] <Decker> like gestures on Black and White you could draw pretty much any size
[06:39:46] <pulse> the only problem i see is with screen sizes. an enormous tablet might require a different physical gesture than a small phone screen

[06:40:05] <Decker> so if it's 0.2 to 0.83 just subtract the min and divide by the difference... to scale it back out to 1
[06:40:16] <smallvil_> eg on a small trackpad you can quickly go from 0.0 to 1.0 with simply your finger alone,     and on a large tablet you cannot quickly go from 0.0 to 1.0 with simply your finger alone

[06:42:11] <smallvil_> )*
[06:42:37] <Decker> scroll is slide along the furthest edges of the pad
[06:42:41] <pulse> smallvil_, pretty sure that's vendor dependent and actually implemented with drivers
[06:42:53] <pulse> trackpads simulate mouse movement, you can't treat them the same way as a touchscreen
[06:43:05] <pulse> i would recommend separate implementations
[06:43:13] <smallvil_> eg place two fingers on the trackpad and move up and down to perform a scroll gesture, place two fingers on the trackpad and rotate one finger around the other to perform a rotation gesture
[06:43:35] <Decker> smallvil_ that's actually super simple - and you get scaling too
[06:43:47] <Decker> *thinks* here did I do that
[06:44:23] <smallvil_> this rotation gesture CANNOT be done using a mice (tho an alternative could be used, such as right-clicking and dragging the mouse to perform a rotation gesture)
[06:44:47] <Decker> smallvil_ I thought you meant like real gestures

[06:45:15] <pulse> smallvil_, pretty sure drivers run that behavior, not algorithms in userland

[06:45:32] <Decker> smallvil_ like black and white - draw a spiral... draw a triangle
[06:45:44] <Decker> figure 8 (sideways )
[06:45:49] <smallvil_> pulse: it would depend
[06:46:37] <smallvil_> eg the OS/compositor itself may simply wrap the gesture in the underlying api's provided by the driver
[06:47:31] <smallvil_> eg a "built-in" scroll gesture may simply be mapped to driver api touch events, touch id's and normalized coordinates
[06:47:37] <pulse> apple has a trackpad API
[06:47:40] <pulse> not sure about other vendors
[06:47:51] <pulse> if i had to guess it's probably poorly standardized

[06:50:45] <perro> somebody climbs first and puts them up
[06:50:46] <smallvil_> basically, how would a gesture be scaled such that it can always be performed by your fingers without needing to move your hand, regardless of the surface size?

[06:55:06] *** Quits: hololeap (~hololeap@user/hololeap) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[06:55:27] <smallvil_> if we have a gesture that activates when the user flings their finger in a certain direction on the trackpad, we calculate the gesture by using delta from normalized coordinates (along with time and velocity)
[06:55:41] <smallvil_> on a small trackpad this works perfectly fine
[06:55:51] <pulse> if i give you 3 tablets of varying sizes, normalized units will make it so that a gesture of a circle is proportionally equivalent between them
[06:55:51] <smallvil_> but what about on a large tablet?
[06:56:00] *** Joins: trevors (~trevors@user/trevors)
[06:56:14] <pulse> unless you want the same sized circle gesture on all screen sizes, in which case you wouldn't use normalized units
[06:56:35] *** Quits: chiselfuse (~chiselfus@user/chiselfuse) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)

[06:57:39] <pulse> but that's why you normalize the units. the physical gesture will vary of course
[06:57:39] <smallvil_> for example, if the surface is 2x bigger, it would mean the user needs to fling their finger 2 times faster

[06:58:49] <pulse> or somehow adjust it based on screen size
[06:58:57] <pulse> naturally a big circle takes more time to make than a small one
[06:59:13] <smallvil_> eg the same fling on a small touchpad may be registered as a fling, but may also be registered as just a normal scroll on a larger touch screen
[06:59:41] <smallvil_> due to the difference in expected delta, and velocity

[09:14:03] <nitrix> Unfortunately, it also incurs new costs from having to continually do unnecessary work. Hence generational gcs, but eventually the rubber meets the road.
[09:15:21] <nitrix> Region-based is great, though has to be done early in the design of the language as it as a direct impact on other areas like calling conventions, ownerships, lifetimes, etc.

[09:17:02] <nitrix> In the end, you "reason about deallocation" with the tools and semantics that the language provides to you. Most of the time that's rather mediocre.
[09:18:49] <KillerWasp> I love malloc/free , Many so-called programmers always use it as an excuse to whimper and search for other languages, but the truth is that it is the essential basis of any program, and allows you to have better control over memory management. That is why all programs made in C are always the best.
[09:20:03] <nitrix> (Perhaps primarily because people are too hell bent on "fixing" the memory management problems caused by aliasing/sharing instead of addressing it at the source with linear types or similar).

[18:14:56] <Bou> if you do `rand() % range` some numbers will appear more often than others though, say range is 30000 and RAND_MAX is 32767 then there are 2 ways to get 500 (500 and 30500) but only one way to get 30001
[18:15:11] <euouae> Bou that's not true
[18:15:57] <euouae> Ooh, under the modulo. That is true!

[18:16:30] <Bou> eh, I messed that up, ofc there is no way to get 30001
[18:17:31] <Bou> correct example: 1 happens for a rand() of 1 and 30001, but 3000 only happens with rand() of 3000 (because 33000 > RAND_MAX)

[18:35:48] <piou> pyzozord: I find laying all cases down helps understanding the modulo issue here. Let's imagine rand() generates a random number between 0 and 9, but we need a number between 0 and 3. If we take modulo 4 then it looks like it would work, but if we write down all cases https://lega.li/4DUtLSI7/unkYwFFPxZ (top row is possible random numbers, bottom row is applying modulo 4) then we see that 0 and 1
[18:35:50] <bayaz> Type: image/png;name="modulus_issue.png" Size: 38.0 kB 
[18:35:54] <piou> come up in more cases than 2 and 3, so we'll see 30% of 0s, 30% of 1s, 20% of 2s and 20% of 3s, which is really bad.

[18:40:27] <piou> euouae: I don't think that would be as good an example because 1) making it too short makes it harder to identify the pattern and more importantly 2) most code dealing with random numbers that avoids that modulo issue do so by finding the biggest multiple of the modulo and discarding the cases after that. With your example it seems that the logic `while (i>=moduli) { i = rand() } ; return
[18:40:32] <apotheon> dodo: We lost deya.
[18:40:33] <piou> i%moduli;` works just as well, missing the good optimization which is finding the biggest possible multiple and only discarding a few cases

[19:09:15] <GeDaMo> Yeah
[19:09:20] <apotheon> Sqaure: If you use a Ruby web application framework, I can suggest a very simple-to-use Markdown library.  Otherwise, you're just going to have to do the research yourself.  Maybe some documentation application already exists that would suit your needs -- probably, in fact.
[19:09:34] <euouae> or are you not even satisfied with what the page of pcg talks about? i.e. I don't know how good this is -- please scrutinize it

[19:09:50] <piou> euouae: you asked me earlier what the issue was if the claim was true. I'm not saying they're wrong in saying that it's harder to break than other PRNG. I'm saying that even if it's harder it's still pointless, and because of that either the claim is well understood and of no value, or it's misunderstood as PCG being secure and then puts users in danger

[21:53:27] <pulse> that always freaked me out tbh
[21:53:36] <apotheon> pulse: Sometimes people call things "he", too -- such as the missus, who thinks of four-wheeled vehicles as masculine rather than feminine.
[21:53:47] <apotheon> Guys typically think of cars as "she", though.
[21:54:21] <GeDaMo> quartz: do you understand it?
[21:54:24] <apotheon> 11:23 < pulse> apotheon, no, i've heard english speakers refer to their pet as it too
[21:54:27] <apotheon> I said "mostly".
[21:54:31] <apotheon> There are exceptions.
[21:54:41] <apotheon> so "no" doesn't really apply there

[21:55:29] <apotheon> Yes, I understood you hadn't heard that when you said it the first time.
[21:55:50] <quartz> GeDaMo: Yes, now that I see the correct solution. The order of the keywords does not matter. I had it stuck in my mind that the DFA was reading the entire string of letters in the same order that was printed in the problem.
[21:55:57] <pyzozord> for example "he is broken" can be about a tv set
[21:56:17] <GeDaMo> quartz: no, the input in this case is one of the keywords
[21:56:22] <pulse> pyzozord, really? i never heard that one
[21:56:30] <quartz> GeDaMo: Yes, that's what I meant.
[21:56:37] <Decker> flakland but along the lines - if they didn't change the spelling too... here's some others - platinum, scrotum
[21:56:39] <pyzozord> "hij is kapot" or "hij is gebroken" I think, I'm not sure
[21:56:48] <GeDaMo> When the keyword ends, the state should be an accepting one
[21:56:50] <pulse> oh, in non-english languages
[21:56:51] <pyzozord> pulse: yeah it's pretty common
[21:56:56] <pyzozord> in nl
[21:56:59] <flakland> HERES another thing,  'k' is bloat. we can deprecate it from the alphabet
[21:57:12] <pulse> in slavic languages everything is either masculine, feminine, or neutral
[21:57:16] <apotheon> flakland: I disagree.
[21:57:16] <quartz> GeDaMo: Yes, exactly, it makes sense now
[21:57:23] <pulse> most germanic too, if i'm not mistaken
[21:57:34] <Decker> flakland then certainly we wouldn't need any hard k sound?

[23:38:41] <KillerWasp> pyzozord: yes, and social skills
[23:39:10] <pyzozord> yes a lot in my case
[23:39:29] <KillerWasp> with 20 points of social skill you can brainwash and make people work for you.
[23:40:08] <pyzozord> well ok the best of the best would be if I could just make games and sell them on steam
[23:40:11] <pyzozord> and live from that
[23:40:23] <KillerWasp> all steam is a lie.
[23:40:30] <pyzozord> but i don't think that's possible
[23:40:34] <KillerWasp> you can't win anything.
[23:41:25] <pyzozord> any b2c business right now requires an internet presence and building a target audience
[23:41:36] <pyzozord> so social skills again
[23:41:56] <pyzozord> youtube is great for that, if you can build say 100,000 subscribers, you are cooking with gas
[23:42:30] <pyzozord> some will buy your stuff, most will market your stuff the best way, organic way
[23:43:36] <pyzozord> but I don't think my english is good enough for youtube, let alone my looks or character
[23:43:57] *** Joins: Masterphi (~Masterphi@user/masterphi)
[23:44:13] <pyzozord> few lucky people have accents that somehow get accepted, but most accents just get ignored, especially strong accents
[23:44:37] <pyzozord> and then you have to be entertaining and consistant
[23:45:12] <hans> by that metric. Morgan Freeman and Tom Scott are pretty damn lucky 
[23:45:45] <pyzozord> those are hollwood stars, not youtube celebrities

[23:46:47] <user51> pyzozord: social skills are easy, you just need to learn how to express yourself. i express myself with my full capability, and now i live in a correctional facility!
[23:47:00] <pyzozord> Arnold Schwarzenegger somehow powered through the glass ceiling of accent, but he is a man of sheer-fucking-will :P
[23:47:08] <hans> (Tom Scott has 5 million youtube subscribers)
[23:47:40] <pyzozord> hans: dosn't matter, they build their audiences outside of youtube
[23:47:51] <KillerWasp> user51: lol
[23:48:05] <pyzozord> user51: hehe
[23:48:51] <KillerWasp> I guess I have at least like 10 points of social skill, as proof of that I'm not in a madhouse. :P
[23:49:59] <KillerWasp> But all of this is pretty depressing, as you get totally sidelined because you can't conform to the stupid stereotypes of characters or tribes.

[23:51:03] <pyzozord> generally life seems to be structured in such a way that it pulls you in the direction you are on. Life wants rich to get richer, poors to get poorer, smart to get smarter, dumb to get dumber, fat to get fatter etc.
[23:51:10] <InPhase> KillerWasp: Freelance work does not mean no boss.  It means many bosses.
[23:51:39] <pyzozord> It's incredibly hard to resist that pull and power through it. But each step you take makes it easier
[23:51:44] <mawk> kill the wasp!! quick!!!
[23:51:45] <KillerWasp> That's why I don't even go on patreon, steam or gog, they are all scams. I can apply a better business model if I just build a website and add a payment box like paypal.
