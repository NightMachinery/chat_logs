[01:08:18] <manicennui> After 4 Killings, ‚ÄòOfficer of the Year‚Äô Is Still on the Job
[01:08:29] <manicennui> (not 4 in one year)
[01:15:42] <manicennui> "Trooper Splain went on to fatally shoot three more people in separate incidents, an extraordinary tally for an officer responsible for patrolling largely rural areas with low rates of violent crime. All four who died were troubled, struggling with drugs, mental illness or both. In two cases, including that of the man with the Uzi, family members had called the police for help because their relatives had threatened to kill
[01:15:42] <manicennui> themselves."
[01:16:23] <manicennui> Called the cops to help them die I guess
[01:16:41] <bkero> That's one way to legalize suicide
[01:18:53] <imode> who else do you call for help. :\
[01:21:00] <jjuran> copslaining
[01:21:25] <jjuran> oops, I meant copsplaining, but the slip is more apropos
[01:25:14] <manicennui> imode: This is America. You gotta be tough and self reliant!
[01:27:08] <manicennui> Apparently the guy with the uzi had it taped to himself pointing at his head.
[01:27:30] <manicennui> Officer Killshot went in and killed him.
[01:27:36] <manicennui> Then claimed that he had pointed the uzi at him.
[01:29:08] <bkero> In Portland we're rolling out the Street Response for non-emergencies.
[01:29:12] <bkero> Cops should not do welfare checks
[01:29:17] <bkero> or mediate domestic disputes
[01:29:27] <bkero> It's based on the CAHOOTS program from Eugene
[01:31:06] <kline> body and gun cams for every cop
[01:31:19] <kline> snap decisions under pressure mitigating factors but never exoneration
[01:32:24] <kline> cops are hired to make the right decisions, making the wrong decision because its stressful or fast moving is a professional failure, and can be used to mitigate how severe the penalities are but not clear someone from that professional failure
[01:32:33] <kline> broadly though, dont arm cops
[01:32:37] <jjuran> Printing "YOU'RE FUCKED" on your weapon counts as premeditation
[01:32:55] <kline> jjuran, that was a hell of an incident
[01:33:22] <kline> a bizarre combination of Twister, Simon Says, and summary execution
[01:33:26] <jjuran> Poor cop got PTSD from murdering someone in cold blood
[01:34:14] <jjuran> well put
[01:34:36] <manicennui> bkero: The question is, what should cops actually do?
[01:35:00] <manicennui> In Chicago people know that there are very few situations where the cops will do anything useful.
[01:35:12] <manicennui> They just exist and get paid more
[01:35:27] <kline> manicennui, be more like british cops, id suggest, which is a far cry from perfect but a hell of a lot better than america
[01:39:12] <bkero> manicennui: what are they supposed to do?
[01:40:09] <manicennui> The public is told that they somehow reduce crime, which is of course not true, even if they do their jobs.
[01:40:19] <manicennui> Cops in Chicago mostly sit in their cars somewhere racking up OT.
[01:40:28] <manicennui> We have a very low homicide solve rate.
[01:40:46] <manicennui> And if they do actually show up for a robbery, at most they will file a report.
[01:40:50] <manicennui> They aren't going to solve anything.
[01:41:11] <manicennui> And if anyone criticizes cops in Chicago, they do a slowdown.
[01:41:21] <manicennui> Which means they are somehow even less useful.
[01:41:36] <manicennui> About the only thing they seem to be good at is unnecessary force.
[01:41:46] <manicennui> Like shooting someone who jumps the turnstile at a CTA station.
[01:43:47] <kline> how cops see this: when we do our job, people call us murderers, when we choose not to do our job, people call us wastes
[01:44:08] <kline> in practice policing in the states sounds like it needs overhauled, but neither side really wants to talk about how that happens
[01:44:10] <manicennui> I think we are also first for police officers per capita.
[01:44:32] <manicennui> kline: Their job isn't showing up, being afraid of everything, and shooting a bunch of people.
[01:44:39] <manicennui> They don't "do their jobs".
[01:45:00] <imode> manicennui: I had a loaded glock pointed at me during the summer by a mentally unstable individual that was heavily intoxicated. I'm thankful the police responded when they did.
[01:45:32] <manicennui> imode: The police almost never prevent that sort of thing here.
[01:45:44] <manicennui> They show up after the fact to write a report.
[01:45:53] <manicennui> Assuming someone was actually killed.
[01:46:02] <manicennui> If not, it is 50/50 whether they will show up.

[01:46:55] <buttsbot> He‚Äôs Got a Gun - Key & Peele - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NzEPICsEug
[01:50:56] <Brekkjern> The police in the US really needs to be made into an organized structure. There's no point in discussing "how to reform the police" when nobody even knows what part of the police one wants to reform
[01:51:09] <Brekkjern> I get that it's "all of it", but that doesn't really help
[01:55:16] <manicennui> Those who don't want things to change like it this way.
[01:55:23] <manicennui> You have to have the same fight hundreds of times.
[02:49:05] <dminkovsky> imode: woah
[02:52:15] <dminkovsky> in new york i've seen cops doing typically bad stuff but also really good stuff
[02:52:37] <dminkovsky> i saw some cops helping a person who was seriously disturbed in a way that goes very much against what people say cops do
[02:52:44] <dminkovsky> it looked like they were really well trained for the situation
[02:52:47] <dminkovsky> they weren't being aggressive at all
[02:52:59] <dminkovsky> trying to de-escalate and get the person to chill out; being really friendly actually
[02:55:06] <imode> case by case basis, I guess.
[02:56:37] <kline> country cops: super friendly, scumbag cops
[02:56:52] <kline> city cops: scumbag personalities, better policing
[02:57:13] <imode> I would rather someone be an asshole and have quality service.

[04:59:58] <Xe> being able to interact with people without having to do it in text or video calls is so nice
[05:00:37] <Brekkjern> I still had to go in to work, so that kept me going, but if I hadn't had to do that I would probably have offed myself by now :P
[05:01:28] <imode> I tried to off myself in January and in December of last year, so this year I'm happy that I got to see someone other than myself and my wife.
[05:01:51] <Brekkjern> Oof
[05:02:19] <imode> brain put up a fight.
[05:02:33] <Brekkjern> I can imagine
[05:03:19] <drakonis> i decided to do a webshit thing in common lisp and wow this is so much better than fucking around with python
[05:03:21] <Brekkjern> I had trouble sleeping and anxiety. Probably stress levels from working full time, studying on the side and having the covid shitstorm on top of it...
[05:04:35] <imode> that seems to be a pretty common symptom, we've got that.
[05:04:44] <imode> we're experimenting with a weighted blanket.
[05:04:49] <imode> or rather, weighted blanket(s).
[05:05:01] <imode> seems to work for her, seems to work for me.
[05:05:33] <Brekkjern> Problem I have is that I don't feel "exhausted" when I'm going to bed.
[05:05:52] <imode> yeah, same.
[05:05:55] <Brekkjern> Neither my body or mind is tired of the day, and I'm just going to sleep because it's late...
[05:06:07] <Xe> VR rhythm games
[05:06:19] <Xe> they get you dancing, makes you work up a sweat and gets you tired
[05:06:23] <Brekkjern> So my mind just keeps whirring about thinking about everything and nothing just to "do" something
[05:06:40] <imode> there's a couple of ways we deal with that. either we stay up late, take melatonin+CBD, or.. well, exhaust ourselves.
[05:07:28] <Church> Man I'm lucky to have been 100% psychologically fine during this pandemic.
[05:07:31] <Church> Apparently
[05:08:03] <Brekkjern> I bet there are a lot of people who have just been on the brink of going into a bad spin
[05:08:27] <Brekkjern> Like, they probably still managed, but if anything else had gone badly it would have been real bad
[05:08:54] <imode> that's an understatement.
[05:08:57] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[05:10:14] <Brekkjern> I can still deal with this, but right now it I get an irrational feeling of anger when the family wants to do things. Like I want to be alone, but at the same time I don't...
[05:10:56] <imode> you have the want to socialize/be near to others but it exhausts you?
[05:11:01] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[05:11:07] <imode> mood.
[05:11:11] <Brekkjern> Mhm
[05:11:27] <skyl4rk> similar
[05:11:28] <imode> wife had a panic attack during thanksgiving. we were all pretty understanding. a year+'s worth of isolation is not healthy.
[05:12:08] <Brekkjern> These feelings were probably also why Arcane was so good for me. It kinda let me feel strong emotions again...
[05:13:31] <Brekkjern> Plus, I recognize some of the emotions some of the characters went through from my own upbringing, even though it wasn't as bad as theirs :P
[05:15:27] <skyl4rk> having to meet relatives (breaking isolation protocol, failing my duty to them and society at large), brushing them off (they miss me and fare worse psychologically as not everyone is a loner like me) - no matter what choice I make, I feel like I fail and have to carry guilt
[05:15:56] <Brekkjern> Yeah, that too
[05:16:26] <skyl4rk> and making me choose /what kind of guilt I prefer to shoulder/ is somehow making it much worse
[05:16:57] <manicennui> I don't feel guilt about other people's wanting to impose shit on me.
[05:17:23] <manicennui> I'm not responsible for their mental health.
[05:17:34] <manicennui> And they lower mine.
[05:17:54] <Brekkjern> That worked for me up to a point
[05:25:48] <skyl4rk> I am not able to condense down relatives needing to see me every once in a while to feel well, as imposing shit on me, but I guess it is to a large amount affected by the nature of those relationships
[05:26:21] <manicennui> I am because they are annoying as fuck.
[05:26:33] <manicennui> It would be different if they were great people.
[05:27:07] <manicennui> Several of them have nothing in their lives but the family, but they are the most boring, annoying people imaginable.
[05:28:58] <manicennui> All they talk about is boring shit other people in the family are doing, or family drama.
[05:29:25] <skyl4rk> I guess then now you have a good excuse to have them at longer than arm's reach then, although if that card is played too strongly it might bite you once "now that covid's over"
[05:29:35] <manicennui> I avoid certain people in the family because of the drama. I don't need to hear about it.
[05:29:47] <imode> I'm thankful I like my family.
[05:30:06] <manicennui> skyl4rk: Nothing to do with covid. I had been estranged from them for years before.

[05:36:36] <buttsbot> I started making this video in May for 4th of July. It's a bit late. : funny
[05:38:19] <manicennui> Brekkjern: In true American fashion, we nearly killed off bald eagles in the 20th century.
[05:38:31] <Brekkjern> Naturally
[05:39:14] <imode> y'know.
[05:39:14] <manicennui> "In 1930 a New York City ornithologist wrote that in the state of Alaska in the previous 12 years approximately 70,000 bald eagles had been shot."
[05:39:18] <manicennui> 'Merica! Fuck yeah!
[05:39:24] <imode> can we hold off on the pessimism for maybe.
[05:39:26] <imode> 24 hours.
[05:39:42] <imode> radical request but I'm ready to commit to it.
[05:39:49] <Brekkjern> lol
[05:39:55] <manicennui> Until we see which new horrors 2022 brings?
[05:40:08] <imode> yeah, I need a breather from seeing the world as a cynic.
[05:40:48] <manicennui> There is nothing about humanity to be optimistic about. We are terrible.
[05:41:17] <Brekkjern> True, but we don't always have to wallow in it
[05:41:44] <imode> I mean, kill yourself then.
[05:41:55] <imode> if nothing is to be expected, what's the use in running down the clock.
[05:41:59] <imode> apart from self-loathing.
[05:41:59] <manicennui> We've had this discussion before.
[05:42:01] <Brekkjern> Let's not go there, imode...
[05:42:08] <manicennui> I'm kind of disappointed that you don't understand why that is a dumb argument.
[05:42:19] * imode shrugs.
[05:42:32] <manicennui> I don't loathe myself.
[05:42:54] <imode> you are a human, humans are terrible, transitivity applies.
[05:43:13] <imode> unless you're a dog and I don't know it.
[05:43:34] <imode> in which case.. there are several government research grants waiting for you.
[05:43:45] <manicennui> I don't try to boil life down to a syllogism.
[05:44:07] <imode> you pretty easily dish 'em out, though.
[05:44:17] <imode> it seems that life is honestly terrible for you.
[05:44:25] <manicennui> Nah.
[05:44:39] <imode> angry all the time, never happy with anyone or anything.
[05:44:47] <imode> any good things happen to you?
[05:44:57] <manicennui> My mental health has been pretty good the last several years since I stopped caring what other people think.
[05:45:25] <Brekkjern> In the interest of keeping this channel civil in the future, may I suggest you choose a different topic entirely or take a breather?
[05:45:39] <imode> that would be advisable.
[05:47:51] <imode> on another positive note, this candle smells so damn good.
[05:48:29] <Brekkjern> imode: Congratulations, you don't have covid: https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/12/01/covid-scented-candle-reviews/
[05:48:30] <Brekkjern> :P
[05:48:37] <imode> hahahahahahahaha.
[05:48:52] <imode> the label describes it as an "in home covid test".
[05:48:57] <imode> it smells like blueberry cheesecake.
[05:48:58] <Brekkjern> Hahahaha
[05:49:04] <imode> good shit.
[05:49:08] <Brekkjern> It's hilarious that this is an actual correlation
[05:49:32] <imode> apparently there's a silver lining to that correlation: smell therapy and olfactory research boomed.
[05:49:45] <Brekkjern> Or, actually... It's probably causative? Covid causing bad scented candle reviews that is.
[05:49:59] <imode> yeah, there's a direct causation.
[05:54:14] <Brekkjern> Holy shit... Dubbing is just horrible on non-animated media...
[05:54:20] <Brekkjern> Norwegian dubbing especially...
[05:57:46] <companion_cube> imode: also, mrna vaccines!!!! awesome
[05:58:00] <companion_cube> in other news, can't wait to test positive for covid in a few days

[05:58:53] <Brekkjern> :/
[06:06:53] <skyl4rk> I got an unexpected christmas card, kickstarted me into a bout of frenzied darkroom work
[06:08:39] <skyl4rk> I don't have a tradition of sending cards, but I guess I can start
[06:14:12] <Brekkjern> I've never really gotten the point of christmas cards myself...
[06:14:17] <Brekkjern> But if it brings you joy, eh?
[06:14:58] <manicennui> Brekkjern: I think they make sense if they are actually meaningful.
[06:15:07] <manicennui> But they are mostly generic shit that people buy at the store.

[06:20:40] <skyl4rk> yes, it's not the card as such (although it had a pun, and I like wordplay/puns), but the meaning in sending it
[06:24:18] <skyl4rk> if the card is sent and received mechanically, just going through the motions, then it's meaningless
[06:27:42] <Brekkjern> True
[06:28:46] <manicennui> The worst are Christmas cards from companies.

[09:28:18] <manicennui> Looks like another bad ass revenge movie.
[09:34:10] <gwozniak> If you like revenge movies, check out the episode "The Ethics of Revenge" of Voir
[09:34:27] <gwozniak> It's a series of short films about film and they are great
[09:34:35] <gwozniak> Ignore the IMDB ratings
[09:34:59] <indigo> Oldboy is an interesting revenge film
[09:37:15] <gwozniak> The movie profiled in that episode, "Lady Vengence" is something I should find.  It sounds fascinatingly disturbing
[09:37:35] <manicennui> I've seen Oldboy.
[09:37:51] <gwozniak> I've seen the original and the remake
[09:37:55] <manicennui> Denzel has done like 3 or 4 movies with a similar plot.
[09:38:04] <manicennui> Two Equalizer films.
[09:38:19] <gwozniak> Yeah
[09:38:28] <gwozniak> And I'll always watch them
[09:38:32] <manicennui> man on Fire
[09:38:35] <manicennui> Man
[09:38:56] <manicennui> The recent Nobody was not bad.
[09:39:06] <gwozniak> I really liked that one
[09:39:23] <manicennui> Such a satisfying premise for an action film.

[09:43:02] <buttsbot> Most Badass Movie Moments Pt.4 - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kV4l0Ovcg8
[09:43:12] <manicennui> There is a scene from a movie called Legend with Tom Hardy that is brutal.
[09:43:38] <manicennui> He plays twins, and they use brass knuckles and hammers to beat up some guys.
[09:58:17] <gwozniak> I always liked that one scene in The Book of Eli
[09:58:44] <gwozniak> And pretty much everything in John Wick is great
[10:03:20] <manicennui> Oh wow.
[10:03:34] <manicennui> Part 1 of that series has the Vader scene from Rogue One.
[10:03:37] <manicennui> So damn good.
[10:03:52] <gwozniak> The only part of Rogue One I liked
[10:04:48] <manicennui> And a scene from a Jason Statham movie I haven't seen called Wild Card.
[10:07:10] <manicennui> There are some Vader comics where he just annihilates people.
[10:07:17] <manicennui> They should turn that into an animated show.

[20:32:51] <manicennui> CVS has to make up for all of the places that now ask whether you want a receipt before printing it.
[20:41:44] <Brekkjern> I'm so glad that this trend hasn't migrated to Norway yet...
[20:41:56] <manicennui> Which trend?
[20:42:05] <manicennui> CVS printing 6 feet of receipts?
[20:43:31] <manicennui> I meant that a lot of places now ask whether you want a receipt and don't print one if you don't, so they print far fewer receipts.
[20:43:32] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[20:43:48] <manicennui> Is CVS in Norway?
[20:43:52] <Brekkjern> Nope

[20:53:31] <manicennui> How ridiculous.
[20:53:51] <manicennui> They act as if making short receipts is some kind of advanced technology that we haven't discovered yet.
[20:54:09] <manicennui> And their solution is to let them invade your privacy more by signing up for some digital bullshit.
[20:55:14] <Brekkjern>  Naturally
[20:59:08] <indigo> Now we just need to put the receipts on the blockchain
[20:59:34] <manicennui> Brilliant!
[21:05:41] <Brekkjern> Please don't make such suggestions...
[21:06:42] <indigo> I wonder how much someone would pay for an NFT of a CVS receipt
[21:06:52] <Brekkjern> Ask the greeks about it?
[21:07:49] <indigo> The greeks? I don‚Äôt get it :(
[21:08:17] <Brekkjern> There was a thing in Greece where you could get tax deductions based on filing some receipts or something

[21:08:46] <indigo> Hahaha I see
[21:08:46] <Brekkjern> Ended up becoming a large tax avoidance scheeme where people would trade receipts and such
[21:10:00] <manicennui> You can deduct some expenses from your taxable income in the US. If you were to be audited, they'd want to see receipts.
[21:10:12] <manicennui> It's generally not enough to be worth gaming much.
[21:10:26] <Brekkjern> Sure. The laws about this was just ridiculous in Greece IIRC.

[22:49:34] <manicennui> It's hard to understand what the justification is for someone making profit on prescription drugs.
[22:49:51] <Brekkjern> Efficiency of distribution
[22:50:01] <Brekkjern> But that's it, and if it's not efficient, then they are not doing their job.
[22:50:39] <manicennui> I don't understand the argument that private companies are the only ones who can do things efficiently.
[22:50:50] <manicennui> Large companies are incredibly inefficient in many ways typically.
[22:50:55] <manicennui> The problem is large organizations.
[22:51:18] <Brekkjern> No, you see, government services never have positive books, so by definition they cannot be efficient.
[22:51:35] <Brekkjern> Never mind that that is the definition of a service rather than a business....
[22:53:24] <manicennui> You could even arrange it as a government organization that gives contracts to companies to run, but with a fixed fee for their services, and a set of criteria that they must continue to meet.
[22:54:00] <manicennui> There should be no additional margin for things that people need to survive/not be sick.
[22:54:49] <manicennui> We actually do this for things like license plate stickers here.
