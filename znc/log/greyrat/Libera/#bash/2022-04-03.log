[00:01:31] <Earnestly> johnjaye: Consider updating a repo mirror for some distribution.  If you just copied one directory to another a mirror might pick up a partial state.  How do you make this atomic?  Have a current symlink pointing to a directory; only after the new tree has been copied in, symlink the current to the new directory - now it's atomic
[00:01:44] <Earnestly> Or hardlink, whatever.  Then you can remove the old directory
[00:02:05] <Earnestly> Or even mv, since I think a directory on the same filesystem just devolves into rename(2)
[00:02:28] <johnjaye> Earnestly: right. i mean power can fail at the exact instance a command runs though right
[00:02:36] <johnjaye> so atomicity in this sense is always relative
[00:02:39] <Earnestly> The point is to reduce multiple operations into one, 'atomic', as in the from ancient greek

[03:22:34] <lembron> XY-ish, a little -- "on its base" the issue is a mysql-import (and technically that has threadding on its own yes) BUT only "when provided with multiple files" and while i DO already have "multiple files", those are not complete (my header&footer are separate .sql-files as I produce that whole thing from unpacking a 3rd-party dump that i then cut up with csplitting :D)
[03:24:25] <userT> I'm reading this https://mywiki.wooledge.org/ParsingLs for correctly parsing ls output. In short there seem to be 2 ways: for loop, and array/vector. Very well, good for local ls. But how can I do if dealing with sftp's ls?

[08:04:47] <lechner> but look how this is used     https://salsa.debian.org/haskell-team/haskell-devscripts/-/blob/master/dh_haskell_provides#L78
[08:06:29] <larryv> $pkg should be quoted there
[08:06:44] <larryv> other than that, that line is okay in isolation
[08:06:57] <larryv> cfiles=`find_config_for_ghc "$pkg"`
[08:07:08] <lechner> and later     https://salsa.debian.org/haskell-team/haskell-devscripts/-/blob/master/dh_haskell_provides#L91
[08:07:26] <larryv> these are bash scripts, so there is actually no reason to use `...`
[08:07:45] <lechner> yeah i know
[08:08:01] <larryv> again, the args should be quoted
[08:08:16] <larryv> unless the scripts are written to depend on wordsplitting
[08:08:21] <larryv> in which case you get what you pay for
[08:08:40] <lechner> but what happens in L91 when $cfiles is used please?
[08:08:55] <lechner> the last link
[08:09:43] <larryv> $hc and $cfiles are substituted, the results undergo wordsplitting and filename generation, provides_for_ghc is called with the results as its args, anything it prints to stdout is stored in provides
[08:10:13] <larryv> look, LFs in expansions within `...` are not systematically turned into spaces
[08:10:15] <larryv> end of story
[08:10:26] <larryv> if they are, it's because of poor quoting
[08:10:54] <larryv> which these scripts sadly seem to have no shortage of
[08:12:08] <lechner> so the $cfiles argument to another routine will generally retain the newlines?
[08:12:15] <larryv> no
[08:12:18] <larryv> because it's not quoted
[08:12:26] <lechner> i see
[08:12:31] <larryv> IF you quote it correctly, it will
[08:13:07] <wiscii> !qefs
[08:13:07] <greybot> "$Quote" "$Every" "${F:-ing}" "$Substitution"
[08:13:15] <larryv> # foo=$'abc\ndef'; printf '<%s>' "$foo"

[08:13:18] <larryv> # foo=$'abc\ndef'; printf '<%s>' $foo
[08:13:19] <shbot> larryv: <abc><def>
[08:13:59] <lechner> and the printf is superior to echo because the argument could contain -n?
[08:14:08] <larryv> or backslahes
[08:14:34] <larryv> echo is not portable, its behavior varies considerably
[08:15:12] <lechner> wow, you have been very helpful. thank you so much!

[08:15:18] <greybot> OK, wiscii

[08:17:28] <lechner> larryv: i had rewrite them in Perl to integrate more tightly with Debhelper and just wanted to make sure my new behavior is compatible. because of the poor quoting, i believe it is

[08:19:29] <larryv> lechner: i will say that `...` does inherently do a lot of weird annoying crap, but changing LFs into spaces isn't one of them
[08:20:04] <lechner> but it does happen in the unquoted expansion, right?
[08:20:52] <larryv> yes, if IFS contains LF (which it does by default), the shell wordsplits on it
[08:21:09] <larryv> (same for tabs)
[08:21:14] <wiscii> unquoted expansion at your own risk!
[08:21:42] <lechner> yeah, that's it. i was just inaccurate in my question because i don't know bash
[08:22:08] <lechner> thanks so much for being here and helping!
[08:22:09] <larryv> it's ok. there's a lot of layers, sometimes it's hard to see which one is the problem
[08:22:24] <larryv> np
[08:22:46] <wiscii> lol ;-)
[08:24:04] <larryv> lechner: also note that the result of `...` itself might undergo wordsplitting and filename gen
[08:24:35] <lechner> what is filename generation, please?
[08:24:39] <larryv> globbing
[08:24:46] <lechner> i see
[08:25:11] <lechner> when does that happen, and how does it fail?
[08:25:23] <wiscii> `...` is replaced by $(...)
[08:25:36] <larryv> but what i said applies to $(...) also
[08:25:55] <lechner> what if the file does not exist?
[08:26:20] <lechner> or there is no match, rather
[08:26:33] <larryv> lechner: it happens if the expansion contains a globbing metacharacter and is not quoted. if the glob doesn't match anything it is left as-is, but that depends entirely on the contents of the filesystem
[08:26:45] <lechner> wow
[08:27:01] <lechner> better quote, then
[08:27:43] <larryv> # foo='.*'; printf '<%s>' "$foo"
[08:27:43] <shbot> larryv: <.*>
[08:27:45] <larryv> # foo='.*'; printf '<%s>' $foo
[08:27:46] <shbot> larryv: <.><..><.bashrc><.mkshrc>
[08:28:26] <larryv> there are a couple of contexts where this doesn't happen, but they are few
[08:29:22] <larryv> this is fine, as long as it's a simple assignment: var=`cmd`
[08:29:29] <larryv> so is this: case `cmd` in ...
[08:30:00] <larryv> otherwise you should generally be wrapping command substitution in double quotes: "`cmd`"
[08:30:44] <lechner> really a classy group here, btw. you should all be proud. look how they helped me convert those scripts to Perl          http://paste.debian.net/1236609/

[16:52:24] <tirnanog> C.UTF-8 is an officially supported locale in glibc, as of v2.35, in case anyone cares.

[16:57:47] <ormaaj> It's kind of pointless isn't it? Encoding should be entirely determined by LC_CTYPE so setting any UTF-8 locale there should do the business. And if you need to tweak other localization things you can just use the C locale in any other LC_* variable
[16:59:35] <jelly> oh.  Sanity preserved by distro.  Debian 7 and RHEL 8 have it.
[17:00:06] <jelly> I'm too used to Debian-specific niceties apparently
[17:00:21] <tirnanog> yes, it does the business. but then how do you know which "any UTF-8 locale" to pick? some platforms don't support en_US.UTF-8 and it's certainly possible to have even a GNU system that doesn't necesarily have that locale installed. I can see the value in having a C.UTF-8 locale that (one day) we can just count on being there.
[17:00:46] <tirnanog> also, musl libc has supported - and defaulted to - a C.UTF-8 locale for as long as I can remember. there may be others.
[17:00:59] <xmb> i have the inofficial policy that i support my code on debian , not on random other or unix bsd or hp ux or so
[17:01:19] <xmb> also in my case C +utf worked nice, where i can see slowness and bugs with en_US happening
[17:01:26] <xmb> so i dont like the en_US at all
[17:01:37] <ormaaj> Oh so it's supposed to be a generic "give me utf-8" in other words... Not a thing that you would set in LC_ALL
[17:01:44] <xmb> also i like the order of C instead of en_US and deb has / had C.UTF-8 so i thought** it does the job

[17:07:40] <tirnanog> I mean, it's true that en_US.UTF-8 is present on most gnu systems and, right now, it probably remains the better bet. yet, there's no actual compulsion for systems to generate that particular locale. it's always possible for locale.gen to be tailored however and for the generated locale archive to follow.
[17:08:01] <tirnanog> so, having a C.UTF-8 no matter how locale.gen was configured probably isn't bad thing.
[17:08:19] <tirnanog> I think debian have been doing this for a while. gentoo was another, albeit much later.

[17:18:46] <jelly> one of the dumbest things about Debian is they're still "saving" about 100MB of disk space by not including precompiled locales by default, but force you to select one at installation time, and only later can you pick a larger set and compile them.  Lots of 3rd party scripts break if you install the precompiled set, because they assume they'll have to jump thruough the hoops.

[23:32:25] <ormaaj> Dr-007: Example to generate your list. Adapt to your script:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/7f2e7950a138f649d49788acab4d94203868e266)
[23:35:12] <larryv> dob1: what do you mean by "the path dir name"? do you want to ignore the last component?
[23:37:36] <pj> if that's the case then modify the above to: [[ "/$path" == *"/$string/"* ]]
[23:37:45] <dob1> larryv, for example string is foobar   /1/foobar/2/3/  OK   /1/2/3  no OK   /1/2/3/foobar/ OK ,  if there is a dir named foobar in as part of the path of the input path
[23:37:47] <kurahaupo> dob1: There are other kinds of pattern matching besides regex. Often they're faster too.
[23:38:18] <larryv> dob1: what about "/1/2/3/foobar"
[23:38:35] <kurahaupo> dob1: What about 1/2/3foobar/4
[23:39:08] <dob1>   /1/2/3/foobar ok, 1/2/3foobar/4  no ok, it's not foobar but 3foobar
[23:39:13] <kurahaupo> What about if input string has / in it, like foo/bar or /foobar/
[23:39:36] *** Joins: vlm (~vlm@user/vlm)
[23:39:46] <dob1> kurahaupo, it's defined in the script
[23:40:03] <kurahaupo> So it won't?
[23:40:05] <dob1> I got your point, but not the case
[23:40:06] <larryv> dob1: so you actually just mean "any path component"
[23:40:12] <dob1> it won't
[23:40:18] <dob1> larryv, yes

[23:41:48] <pj> # path=1/2/foobar/3 string=foobar; if [[ "/$path/" == *"/$string/"* ]]; then printf "Match\n"; else printf "No Match\n"; fi

[23:42:36] <pj> ...and so on
[23:44:32] <pj> lembron: there are various different ways, one easy way would be to grep for the line then grep -v for it.
[23:45:04] *** Quits: ExeciN (~ExeciN@user/nicexe) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:45:56] <pj> ...or you can use readarray to split the lines into an array, find the matching element, then use slices to display the bits you want in the order you want.

[23:59:19] <lembron> (the "leading space" is obvs only for illustration purposes too^^)
[23:59:43] <pj> yeah, but it was in the lines, so when I anchored the grep it needed to be in the regex
[23:59:53] <lembron> and "habit of using printf" is kinda meh.. having to "\n" everything is 11 characters vs 5 :P
