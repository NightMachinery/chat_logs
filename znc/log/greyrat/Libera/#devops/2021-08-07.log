[17:51:20] <CuriousErnestBro> what does github actions do? run code on github's servers?
[17:51:28] <CuriousErnestBro> how do I make it run code on my servers?
[17:53:18] <rawtaz> i guess you can make the actions perform some outbound cal to your systems if you want to?
[17:53:23] <rawtaz> unless they blocked that somehow
[18:16:40] <CuriousErnestBro> I found it: use rsync package
[18:17:34] <CuriousErnestBro> so will something like this start 3 different vm instances? https://github.com/actions-rs/example/blob/master/.github/workflows/quickstart.yml
[18:17:44] <CuriousErnestBro> I can't seem to put it all into one block 
[18:17:52] <rawtaz> running rsync isnt really the same as "run code on my servers"
[18:18:39] <CuriousErnestBro> rawtaz yeah, the first step is copying, then I'll ssh in and tell systemd to restart the service (which will compile and run the program)
[18:20:13] <rawtaz> sorry but why on earth are you trying to do this in the first place?
[18:20:36] <rawtaz> whats the problem youre trying to solve by not running the actions/tests/builds on the github servers in their actions?
[18:21:37] <CuriousErnestBro> oh I am running the tests+builds+linter on GH's servers
[18:21:53] <CuriousErnestBro> after that I need to deploy to my (arm) ubuntu instance
[18:22:25] <CuriousErnestBro> so I'm checking on GH's servers if it's "compilable" and tests work, then I copy files over to my server, compile again, and restart the service 
[18:23:45] <CuriousErnestBro> I'm not sure if this makes sense (or is even a good idea, can you just move over binaries and it'll work?), it's my first day doing CI stuff rawtaz :D
[18:30:25] <rawtaz> what do you mean "can you just move over binaries and it'll work?"?
[18:31:40] <CuriousErnestBro> rawtaz when I compile the (rust) program, I'll have a binary, can I just rsync that over to my server and run it?
[18:31:54] <CuriousErnestBro> or do I have to compile it on the server itself (instead of GH's servers)
[18:32:24] <kubblai> CuriousErnestBro: provided its compiled for the arch that should be ok
[18:32:59] <CuriousErnestBro> isn't it more "better" and optimized to compile it on the server itself
[18:33:07] <CuriousErnestBro> idk how computers work sorry
[18:33:08] <rawtaz> CuriousErnestBro: *obviously* that depends on whether or not that binary is built such that it will run on your server's architecture and OS.
[18:33:48] <rawtaz> not necessarily no. e.g. Go is pretty known for cross-compiling really well. you can build windows binaries on your linux, etc. last time i checked Rust didnt cross-compile out of the box so i dunno the state of that
[18:33:54] <rawtaz> simply look into rust cross-compiling
[18:34:10] <rawtaz> but if you build for linux and e.g. amd64 and run it on that, it should work fine i believe, i dont see why not
[18:34:24] <rawtaz> if yuo dont know how computers work, why are you trying to set up a dev flow? :P
[18:34:47] <CuriousErnestBro> okay, I didn't know x86_64 could compile for arm64 
[18:35:04] <rawtaz> it cant. it's an architecture
[18:35:15] <CuriousErnestBro> rawtaz I don't have to know photosynthesis to plant a tree :D
[18:35:29] <CuriousErnestBro> what does cross-compilation entail then?
[18:36:11] <rawtaz> look into cross-compiling and what rust can do in that area. if you even need it. you could start by just seeing if the binary runs
[18:36:39] <CuriousErnestBro> okay, thank you :D
[18:36:59] <rawtaz> yw
[18:37:21] <rawtaz> cross-compilation is one of the best things with Go IMO
[18:37:25] <rawtaz> it's awesome!
[18:37:59] <kubblai> rawtaz: stop it. im meant to be learning go today but find my self on irc instead :(
[18:38:00] <lantech19446> CuriousErnestBro: if you don't understand photosynthesis at least a little bit you don't know whether the tree will grow where you're planting it 
[18:38:09] <rawtaz> kubblai: haha :D

[18:47:28] <rawtaz> yeah its pretty cool and helpful :)
[18:58:13] <CuriousErnestBro> is the dash - optional in GH actions yml files?
[19:01:53] <rawtaz> if it's YML it has to follow YML syntax

[19:58:21] <CuriousErnestBro> if my app is listening on localhost port 443, do I just need to unblock it with iptables to make it work?
[20:00:07] <rawtaz> try it?
[20:00:26] <rawtaz> if you even need to "unblock" it
[20:16:06] <zigsphere> If your app isn't listening period, then the app isn't running. That's not a firewall issue. 
[20:16:36] <zigsphere> sudo netstat -tunlp | grep 443
[20:16:45] <zigsphere> Does that return anything
[20:24:55] <rawtaz> you realize they havent even said there's a problem to debug?

[21:46:44] <CuriousErnestBro> it was a firewall issue
[21:46:48] <CuriousErnestBro> from my hosting provider 
[21:46:58] <CuriousErnestBro> fixed it by enabling all traffic 
[21:47:34] <zigsphere> Glad you got it figured out
[21:48:17] <CuriousErnestBro> nginx is still not working
[21:48:24] <CuriousErnestBro> I tried removing my /etc/nginx folder
[21:48:37] <CuriousErnestBro> and reinstalling it, didn't re-create it
[21:49:20] <CuriousErnestBro> at this point I'm nuking the vps and trying again
[21:52:20] <CuriousErnestBro> what's the difference between iptables and ufw?
[21:52:46] <DerpGusta> Ufw is a convenience layer
[21:52:56] *** Joins: hendursaga (~weechat@user/hendursaga)
[21:53:37] <CuriousErnestBro> does it configure the same stuff as ufw?
[21:53:42] <CuriousErnestBro> as iptables I mean
[21:55:39] <zigsphere> You would either have one or the other. They are both firewall solutions. 
[21:56:11] <zigsphere> They have the same functionality for the most part. Chinese down to what you are comfortable/familiar with
[21:56:25] <zigsphere> Comes*
