[01:01:03] <waltman> I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but does anyone know why mutt is only 2.0.5 in 21.10? Version 2.1.0 came out in June. I thought for sure it would be in impish.
[01:01:57] <gneeriiloeepdeer> do you know 0AD? (ubuntu game). I started playing it and after 3 minutes the screen alternating between being pitch black and showing the screen for milliseconds. I had to suspend the computer to get a working desktop once again. What explain this behavior?

[11:54:51] <tomreyn> these choices are provided by (debian=.deb) packages. this openmpi-bin seems to be buggy in that it provides the same choice twice (if i'm interpreting this correctly).
[11:54:59] <repz> yes i get that but i am not familiar with mpicc/openmpi and i'm not sure how to get rid of this issue (any apt operation is locked for now)
[11:55:08] <repz> hmm ok
[11:56:11] <tomreyn> can you show    update-alternatives --list mpi | nc termbin.com 9999
[11:57:33] <tomreyn> looks like debian has a matching bug report (through it's old, might be something similar) slave link same as main link

[12:13:36] <tomreyn> it's either a packaging bug, or you messed up your package system by installing software from incompatible sources
[12:13:45] <repz> never messed with mpi
[12:13:47] <tomreyn> try this: apt list --installed | grep ',local\]$' | nc termbin.com 9999
[12:14:10] <tomreyn> and show   apt policy
[12:14:30] <repz> this local grep does not catch anything
[12:14:56] <tomreyn> ok, the first would have shown packages without upgrade path

[12:16:13] <repz> https://termbin.com/drv1
[12:16:50] <tomreyn> okay, that's clean as can be, only official sources. so i guess it's really a packaging bug in the openmpi-bin package

[12:58:21] <tomreyn> oh, i guess i'm wrong there, this must be specific to my localized keyboard
[12:59:08] <tomreyn> eggroll: you can safely test sysrq by switching to a tty...
[12:59:10] <tomreyn> !tty
[12:59:10] <ubottu> To get to the TTY terminals 3-6, use the keystroke Ctrl + Alt + F3-F6 respectively. Ctrl-Alt-F2 or Ctrl-Alt-F1 will get you back to your graphical login (Ctrl-Alt-F7 on 16.04). To change TTY resolution, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ChangeTTYResolution
[12:59:28] <Donald_> It was freezing when I was using Google Chrome.
[12:59:33] <tomreyn> ... and then pressing Alt-Sysrq-h which will print help to screen

[13:05:18] <TJ-> worth noting Ubuntu defaults to disabling many of the magic sysrq functions
[13:05:46] <tomreyn> Donald_: you're running SAR there, maybe it can hint on what happened.
[13:07:12] <tomreyn> Donald_: other than that, if this system willfreeze repeatedly, you should probably run a memtest overnight and maybe prepare for some kernel debugging
[13:08:04] <tomreyn> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSystemCrash
[13:09:40] <tomreyn> i think current ubuntu releases only allow for U (emergency unmount) and B (reboot) of the 'reisub' sequence

Additionally, lm-sensors can be useful to monitor temperatures and fan speeds - See also !benchmark
[13:15:55] <tomreyn> memtest86+ is an installable package. for newer systems, if you prefer uefi booting, you need to prepare a usb stick with the free version from memtest86.com instead

[21:03:29] <ldsh> Hi, I did update to 21.10 and Conky doesn't seem to start on startup any-more. It's still on the list of "Startup Application Preferences", and I tried adding some delay, but no conky showing up. If I start manually, it works fine. Do you know where I can look for the log of what is happening at startup?
