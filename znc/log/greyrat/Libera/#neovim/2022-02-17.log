[03:18:09] <BennyPowers[m]> Adapting the regexp parser from atom coffeescript (ugh) to nvim treesitter I think will be the hardest part
[03:19:46] <moldorcoder7> hi could somebody provide me his lua config that woeks on 0.6 to auto organize imports in go on save. looks like there has been various way with some stabilization aroundthis :https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/issues/115
[03:19:48] <dre> BennyPowers[m], I'd approach from a different angle; bind it to a keybind first, juso so you can easily test the functions; then at the very end, add it to the treesiter / query 
[03:20:08] <dre> I also need to learn how to write plugins that look at the TS tree and etc
[03:21:50] <BennyPowers[m]> Well I have the regexp node from treesitter already
[03:21:59] <BennyPowers[m]> Bound
[03:22:04] <BennyPowers[m]> One sec I'll show you

Might take some elbow grease (or might not if content is always passed directly to the LSP server) compared to running all of it remotely

[17:37:36] <moldorcoder7> when usong lsp on go, after a  few minutes to hours im getting this error displayed in the middle of a line : treesitter/highlighter: Error executing lua: /usr/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/treesitter/query.lua:403: invalid start
[17:37:42] <moldorcoder7> looks like a treesitter bug
[17:37:59] <moldorcoder7> anybody got an idea , should i just open an issue on treesitter
[17:39:50] <clason[m]> first try to reproduce it with a minimal setup (no plugins, and certainly no lsp)
[17:40:42] <moldorcoder7> it is random, pretty hard to find  pattern
[17:41:07] <moldorcoder7> but isee it has been appearing for others here : https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/issues/651
[17:41:23] <clason[m]> without any pattern and context, it's pretty hard to fix
[17:42:44] <clason[m]> moldorcoder7: not so sure. that issue has been closed (and is about a different error), so this might be something else
[17:42:45] <moldorcoder7> ok TSBufDisable highlight at least removes them :)
[17:43:01] <clason[m]> (or not, but it's impossible to tell without further information)
[17:43:24] <moldorcoder7> clason[m], ho may be i misread , i saw it is just not appearing that often , will open an issue and see then
[17:43:51] <clason[m]> No, please don't, at least not without concrete reproduction steps
[17:43:57] <moldorcoder7> what are ts highlight exactly ?
[17:43:58] <clason[m]> otherwise this is not really going to be helpful
[17:44:01] <moldorcoder7> where are they used
[17:44:09] <moldorcoder7> ok
[17:44:16] <clason[m]> hard to tell without knowing your config
[17:44:19] <clason[m]> but it's syntax highlighting

[17:47:20] <jubalh> Hello guys! I have a configure.ac script that I would like to format. So since it's just bash + macros I thought I could use vim for this with the `=` key. However if I for example have a if block the fi is not on the same like like the `if`. So two questions 1) Anyone has a idea how to automatically format a configure.ac file? 2) How can I find out according to which rules `=` operates?
[17:48:19] <moldorcoder7> clason[m], i tought it was needed by nvim-cmp actually
[17:48:26] <moldorcoder7> now i got it , dont need it actually
[17:48:41] <clason[m]> yeah, I'd be surprised if it did ;)
[17:48:50] <moldorcoder7> telescope neither ?
[17:48:53] <clason[m]> jubalh: !h =
[17:49:16] <moldorcoder7> i actually was using coc until recently then made the lsp jump,
[17:49:20] <clason[m]> (spoiler: `=` does not format, just indents)
[17:49:34] <moldorcoder7> got it now i just disabled highlight :)
[17:50:04] <jubalh> clason[m]: I see, thanks for that. But even it indents in a strange way! Don't see why the `fi` is at thie position
[17:50:06] <clason[m]> just uninstall nvim-treesitter then, that's easiest
[17:50:27] <clason[m]> well, that depends on your indent settings

[18:15:04] <clason[m]> right
[18:16:11] <clason[m]> could be a fallout from a previous change in Neovim -- `bufnr=nil` used to be taken implicitly as "current buffer", which was undocumented (and unintended) behavior.

[22:46:43] <nmattia[m]> @clason let me read up on `packpath`. Does that also require the `plugin/`/`colors/`... structure or will it simply load whatever is in there?

[22:57:42] <gpanders> vonheikemen: have you seen https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim?
[22:57:50] <gpanders> it sounds like what you are suggesting
[22:58:41] <nmattia[m]> <clason[m]> "but, yeah, set `packpath` to..." <- ok, I think I might have misunderstood something. I "think" I tried that, but it gives me:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/221c005601b545d8968e5d883299d2acbda4dc55)
[22:58:59] <clason[m]> forgot a `pack`
[22:59:11] <mjlbach[m]> gpanders: I think the idea is to basically abstract out the combination of plugins into a meta plugin like the short lived baby.nvim
[22:59:13] <nmattia[m]> clason[m]: oh I thought that was just the name you gave to the dir
[22:59:23] <clason[m]> should be `pack/nix-is-cool/start/nvim-tree/`
[22:59:23] <mjlbach[m]> I'm actually totally fine/encourage people to do this
[22:59:32] <clason[m]> no, there's a `pack` _and_ another dir
[22:59:34] <mjlbach[m]> It was one of the motivations for `packspec` :P 
[23:02:02] <nmattia[m]> wow ok this worked:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/bc6eb92b49148c78c8073760cb1b9941b669bece)
[23:02:27] <nmattia[m]> `:help packspec` doesn't say anything
[23:02:30] <nvim-bot[m]> No help found for:
[23:02:30] <nvim-bot[m]> * `packspec`
[23:02:37] <mjlbach[m]> Oh
[23:02:42] <mjlbach[m]> It's not a thing yet

[23:03:13] <mjlbach[m]> Adding package dependencies (nvim-cmp, lspconfig, nvim-lsp-installer), etc could be done via a packspec file

[23:06:40] <vonheikemen[m]> like the user would just need to write something like this.... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/d480f9aa46e5d7c05e08c4a3bfb3b49df0187135)
[23:07:03] <mjlbach[m]> I think tbh it should be even simpler for that
[23:08:21] <mjlbach[m]> I would simplify it to use a filetype autocommand that asks the users "would you like to install x language server" on the first time a user starts up a new filetype, and then the plugin would have some statefile where it would record the user response, if yes install the language server and then on each start read these "imperatively" declared installed servers
[23:09:24] <mjlbach[m]> Until it is literally press yes/no to LSP people will still think it is too hard (based on my experience writing documentation and trying/failing to teach the subset of users this is likely targeting)

[23:17:53] <mjlbach[m]> I would avoid using nvim-lsp-installer's setup call

[23:27:18] <vonheikemen[m]> oh ok.
[23:27:18] <vonheikemen[m]> is there anything in neovim 0.7 that could affect a plugin like this?
[23:27:18] <vonheikemen[m]> like using `nvim-lspconfig` would still be ok after you merge some of its features to neovim?

[23:35:39] <mjlbach[m]> You'll need to update things probably
[23:37:24] <dundargoc> mizlan[m]: ```
[23:37:24] <dundargoc> nvim -es +"verbose echo stdpath('data')"
[23:37:24] <dundargoc> ```
[23:37:24] <dundargoc> should work I think
[23:38:14] <dundargoc> That or just `$XDG_DATA_HOME`, pretty sure stdpath just uses that.

[23:54:36] <Betal> is the anti996 license a foss license?
[23:55:43] <Betal> noticed coc-nvim changed from mit to anti996
[23:56:18] <ii14[m]> isnt that the japan or china thing
[23:56:22] <ii14[m]> protest or something
[23:57:32] <zennmystic[m]> Looking through some of the lua files in neovim  I see calls like this...node:named_child() or node:type()... what dies it actually do? call a method/fuction on an object...? I tried to google but not sure what I'm looking for
[23:58:01] <ii14[m]> depends how do you define foss, if you mean GPL then no it's not foss
[23:58:06] <ii14[m]> if MIT then yes it's foss
[23:58:29] <ii14[m]> or not really even
[23:58:47] <ii14[m]> it's more of this ethical source licenses or whatever they're called
[23:59:54] <ii14[m]> so it's basically MIT + some restrictions that you can't use it for some things
