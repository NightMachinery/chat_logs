[14:28:48] <lizmat> frost: there's a number of issues at work here
[14:31:36] <lizmat> 1. is-prime internally keeps a list of the first N primes, where N is I believe at least 100_000
[14:32:12] <lizmat> so for the cases you're hypering over, the actual amount of work is minimal (as you can see in the time of the unhypered version)
[14:32:46] <lizmat> 2. hypering introduces overhead: threads need to be started, results must be cached until they can be produced in the right order, etc. etc.
[14:33:17] <lizmat> if the workload is very small, the overhead will drown the actual work being done
[14:33:20] <frost> lizmat Thanks, I'm just a little strange about the explanation in the document for introducing hyper.
[14:33:47] <frost> Yes, it does.
[14:34:49] <lizmat> 3. batch size is also important for getting a good balance between the overhead and amount of work
[14:35:52] <lizmat> compare:
[14:35:55] <lizmat> m: my @a = ^5_000_000 .map(*.is-prime); say now -INIT now;
[14:35:57] <camelia> rakudo-moar 16917ac4d: OUTPUT: «1.673786247␤»

[14:36:44] <camelia> rakudo-moar 16917ac4d: OUTPUT: «1.408956095␤»
[14:36:52] <frost> m: my @a = hyper for ^100_000_0 { $_**2  }; say now -INIT now;
[14:36:54] <camelia> rakudo-moar 16917ac4d: OUTPUT: «1.698961276␤»

[14:37:06] <camelia> rakudo-moar 16917ac4d: OUTPUT: «0.715294501␤»
[14:37:24] <lizmat> $_ ** 2 is still not a lot of work :-)
[14:37:52] <frost> But it is more fast !
[14:37:57] <frost> faster
[14:38:26] <frost> Oh, on my machine
[14:38:34] <frost> hyper is more faster
[14:39:17] <frost> Maybe I have less cores :)
[14:39:40] <lizmat> yeah, it's hardware dependent as well, depending on number of physical cores
[14:40:00] <lizmat> virtual cores don't help much if they're doing the same kind of operations at machine level

[16:45:47] <El_Che> :)
[16:46:03] <tbrowder> going back to drawing board with tail between legs...
[16:46:14] <El_Che> from this day forward he will be known as "The Master of Git"
[16:46:25] <El_Che> (of if a new repo "The Main of Git") 
[16:46:39] <tbrowder> all hail Altreus
[16:47:27] <El_Che> a git subcmd: git whatwouldAltreusDo
[16:47:52] <MasterDuke58> lizmat: is-prime doesn't really keep any list at all. it's so fast to check that it doesn't make sense
[16:49:33] <lizmat> MasterDuke58: I thought the new implementation we use, had a bitmap or somesuch for the first N numbers being prime?
[16:49:45] <lizmat> guess I'm mistaken then  :-)
[16:50:13] <MasterDuke58> well, there is an if statement for the first 4 primes
[16:51:26] <MasterDuke58> there is a table kept https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/src/math/bigintops.c#L1520-L1533 but it's for doing the calculation, not of the primes themselves
[16:51:55] * MasterDuke58 doesn't really understand the math, just copy-pasted the code and it worked and called it a day
[16:52:23] <lizmat> MasterDuke58++
[16:53:44] <Altreus> Sadly I have had to accept this role in every company I've worked at
[16:53:55] <Altreus> I didn't even set out to learn it. I just remembered how I solved problems :D

[17:04:15] <Altreus> yes, my role is to watch everyone else screw up git :D

[17:33:19] <tbrowder> ok, got the "correct" master again WITH the rakuast branch, whew, thanks again Altreus.
[17:34:16] <Altreus> yay :)
[17:34:20] <Altreus> distribution is a blessing and a curse

[17:38:55] <tbrowder> i remember same problem before, "git  help branch" does not show the "--remote". i think Altreus helped before and i filed a git bug. am i blind? does anyone see "--remote" in "git help branch"?
[17:41:48] <Altreus> looks like it is actually 'remotes'
[17:41:50] <Altreus> -r --remotes
[17:42:09] <Altreus> I'm guessing it either does unique starting strings, or has an undocumented alias
[17:45:09] <tbrowder> ok, now i see it, way down the page. the online git manual page shows it at the top in the summary, that's what keeps fooling me.
[17:45:49] <Altreus> tells you what it does when you know it's there, but doesn't tell you that it's there when you want something that does that
[17:47:07] <tbrowder> yepper
[17:47:40] <tbrowder> so, how about sphinx for raku docs?
[17:50:34] <tbrowder> .ask jmerelo how about sphinx-doc.org for raku docs?
[17:50:35] <tellable6> tbrowder, I'll pass your message to jmerelo

[19:15:08] <raydiak> speaking of pod, is someone willing to merge https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/4433 ?
[19:15:32] <raydiak> idk what that one ci failure is about, but it's clearly nothing to do with my changes
[19:18:49] <raydiak> heh it's so old now you can't even see the log. it was something early on in the build tooling, nothing to do with pod2text
[19:38:55] <vrurg> raydiak: I tried to initiate re-run for the failed check, but it resist me. Unfortunately, I'd rather not merge it because I barely familiar with Pod internals. 
[19:40:14] <vrurg> raydiak: I think the checks are too old for re-runs. You can do a minor commit to initiate new ones.
[19:41:11] <MasterDuke58> just force push a no-change commit
[19:43:33] <MasterDuke58> e.g., something like `git commit --reset-author && git push --force`
[19:48:53] <Altreus> rebase it :P
[19:51:28] <MasterDuke58> or yeah, just rebase up to master and then force push
[19:52:33] <[Coke]> (moving, fiber). I remember when this house got *cable* (not just internet over cable). any moves to a new house, we need fiber or a really good reason why not. :)
[19:52:55] <Altreus> If you're turning the branch head into a new commit anyway you might as well make the most of it :)
[19:53:27] <Altreus> on the plus side there's a house on the market with better internet than ... somewhere else ...

[20:21:31] <raydiak> thanks for the tips, I rebased it, ci is running. I won't be around for several hours. I'll ping lizmat on it if nobody merges by the time I'm back, I just avoid hassling her specifically since she already does so much...
[20:24:21] <Altreus> It's possible you just pinged her anyway ;)
[20:24:35] <raydiak> oh...right :)
[20:27:09] <raydiak> anyway, I'm off...y'all have a good * o/
