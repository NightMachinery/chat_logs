[10:14:54] <alMalsamo> So someone random on the interwebs is claiming that EULAs are legitimate contracts because people click "Agree" voluntarily binding them to the agreement/contract, whereas simply putting a LICENSE file in a repo has no agreement so it should not be valid
[10:15:31] <alMalsamo> I am not a lawyer and I haven't read contract law or anything similar, so what exactly makes LICENSE text files legally binding when there are no click-through agreements?
[10:16:09] <alMalsamo> is the only legal precendent court cases where the GPL was upheld, or is there some specific legislation that can be referenced that makes LICENSE text files legally binding?
[10:17:46] <alMalsamo> They claim LICENSE files are not legitimate because it seeks to hold someone accountable to a contract that they did not voluntarily bind themselves to.
[10:17:53] <alMalsamo> "You can't give someone information, then retrospectively try to condition its use on consent to a contract. The second you give out that information, you have no more right to decide how someone acts on it."
[10:20:35] <klys> meh, i'd put a license file in a git repo and use agpl3.  or i'd share my paste and then petition "the author respectfully and politely request your compliance with the gpl."
[10:20:51] <klys> s/request/requests/
[10:22:00] <DiffieHellman> alMalsamo: The LICENSE file isn't binding on its own, but it applies as soon as someone distributes the software.
[10:23:02] <alMalsamo> DiffieHellman: Do you know specific legislation that makes LICENSE files legally binding upon distribution?
[10:23:11] <DiffieHellman> Copyright does not permit distribution by default, the license is the thing that permits you to distribute under certain terms, so by distributing, you accept the license. If you don't accept the license, you can do nothing and not distribte it.
[10:23:12] <klys> perhaps, perhaps not, just I think you're being weird if you want me to manipulate your behavior
[10:23:54] <DiffieHellman> alMalsamo: Specific legistation is the part of copyright law that applies to software.

[10:26:40] <DiffieHellman> 3>You can't give someone information, then retrospectively try to condition its use on consent to a contract The software can be used by the person in any way that they like without agreeing to the contract, but the only way that can distribute legally is by agreeing to the contract pretty much.

[10:46:41] <GoatAvenger> I'm pretty sure, the license text file and the notices in the source files, constitutes, 'notice.'
[10:47:01] <GoatAvenger> as in, you have been informed of the rules set forth that govern what you have acquired
[10:47:17] <GoatAvenger> like a sign on a gas station that says, 'no shirt no service.'
[10:47:22] <GoatAvenger> you have been given notice
[10:47:35] <GoatAvenger> but, i dunno, just my guess

[10:49:15] <DiffieHellman> In th's case, not seeing the sign means that you don't have any permission to distribute under copyright.
[10:49:20] <DiffieHellman> *this
[10:50:35] <GoatAvenger> EULA's are a bit different, in that, they tend to dictate specific limitations designed to artificially create scarcity and may hold you to specific, 'agreements,' that have nothing to do with the software itself
[10:50:37] <GoatAvenger> i think
[10:51:19] <DiffieHellman> That's pretty much what an EULA does.
[10:51:56] <DiffieHellman> EULA's have dubious legality, as it's worse for you to read an EULA then not to read it.

[11:05:46] <GoatAvenger> People may be dismayed that they can't make as much money; and that may be true.  However, in reality, if all software was free, I think it's quite possible nothing would be different pay wise.
[11:06:11] <GoatAvenger> Programming is a skill that only a few people can really muster to do well, and we'd have to pay them what their skill is worth.
[11:06:38] <GoatAvenger> it's the EULA's, artificial scarcity, and all that, that only make it a tough scene for those going against the common trends.

[11:07:12] <GoatAvenger> It's only difficult to plant trees, if you are trying to do it where there is a logging site.
[11:07:18] <DiffieHellman> Most software is custom, so most written software is arguably free software if the customer is smart enough to write in the contract that they'll recieve the copyright, so currently people who write software already make plenty of mony of free software.

[11:10:19] <GoatAvenger> by enforcing, through law, artificial scarcity and exploitative tactics..
[11:10:48] <GoatAvenger> The publishing industry does this as well with scientific literature, the movie industry, the record industry, etc.. etc..
[11:11:24] <GoatAvenger> but they have a lot of mass and a lot of momentum, and it's hard for one person or a small group of people to affect the trajectory of that mass

[23:13:24] <zleap> i am using debian
[23:13:42] <isf> but debian isnt a free distro, see this article: https://www.gnu.org/distros/
[23:15:25] <zleap> well other than rocksndiamonds,  it seems I am running pretty much free software
[23:15:51] <isf> your next step is move to a free distro!
[23:16:02] <isf> i believe you can do it! 
[23:16:07] <zleap> i use what works
[23:16:20] <zleap> I have meetings from time to time that use zoom,  
[23:16:29] <zleap> but that is installed in a snap package

[23:20:14] <isf> that is your next step and run a free distro!
[23:20:25] <zleap> i am sticking with what works,  
[23:20:34] <zleap> i can't afford to have thigs mess up,  i have stuff to do

[23:33:09] <zleap> i am not ramming that down peoples throats it annoys them and is detrimental to the cause
[23:33:50] <zleap> now if you opened up a company in say Torquay and advertised jobs where one needed to apply with say a odf format resume, or only used free software, so demanded people can use Libreoffice
[23:35:06] <yang> zleap: there are USB Wi-Fi dongles which can be used with FS only
[23:35:13] <madage> zleap: there usb dongles that provide wifi without the need for non-free firmwares, with that you can solve this particular issue without buying a new laptop
[23:35:43] <zleap> i saw one for £50
[23:35:46] <zleap> which is a total rip off
[23:36:25] <isf>  £50 is a good price becouse is a good device
[23:36:53] <isf> you can connect a Ethernet cable to your connection too 
[23:36:56] <zleap> it is a rip off for a small uSB device
[23:36:59] <yang> check on h-node for compatibility and if you can find any cheaper dongle
[23:37:07] <isf> thats true too.
[23:37:17] <yang> you can probably buy it on EBAY
[23:37:19] <zleap> I can't connect my netbook to the local library internet via network cable
[23:37:44] <zleap> i tried it on saturday,  network there is too locked down
[23:37:57] <madage> I can relate with the feeling of being overwhelmed sometimes with trying a purist approach to freedom, you sure don't need to force people straight from windows to a fully free distro, but it is good to be conscious of the remaining steps
[23:37:59] <isf> that depend of the library, but if you buy a cheaper dongle what have compatibility witha free driver, that can solve your freedom problem
[23:38:00] <zleap> that £50 can be better put towards important things, i dunno getting to / from work
[23:38:34] <madage> and it's very important to not straight away believe you "can't" do something, because then you will never try and never find out if you can/can't

[23:48:14] <zleap> you need to open up conversations
[23:48:23] <isf> see this video maybe you like it:
[23:48:29] <zleap> like drop the fact that you use jitsi or bbb in to a conversation
[23:48:52] <isf> https://video.hardlimit.com/w/qQQ65bQnaRHZDVoQuomQCg
[23:48:53] <zleap> find kids who are interested,  and help them,  
[23:50:37] <zleap> or more first, find out what people use their computer for,  then suggest something it could be that their game won't work on Linux
[23:50:42] <isf> in my experience, as im against the nonfree software when people want contact me, or use something with me i say "ok but without the nonfree software" try this:
[23:51:11] <isf> becouse always the philosophical ideals of free software movement are present in my arguments
[23:52:22] <isf> when i recommend install gnu with linux in dont try to hide the gnu operating system becouse is like hide the ideals of freedom
[23:52:35] <isf> i dont know nothing who run linux what respect the users freedom
[23:52:57] <isf> only the gnu operating system with the linux-libre who are part of the gnu project so is called the gnu-linux-libre
[23:54:08] <zleap> i stopped using Windows 15 years ago

[23:57:57] <zleap> As with learndevon people are not offered a choice
[23:58:19] <zleap> so unless that changes, which choice is also linked to Demand,  demand is usually set by employers
[23:58:44] <zleap> what would be really nice is helping people get involved with free software, contribution
[23:59:07] <zleap> but then linking the skills developed to something employers want
