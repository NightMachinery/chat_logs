[17:02:24] <clason[m]> yes
[17:03:03] <clason[m]> (but note that the API policy has changed in the post-0.5 world -- before, the C API was pretty much the only game in town; now we're much more bullish on Lua)
[17:03:09] <numToStr[m]> hmmm, so I suppose I'll be desirable to expose `nvim_buf_{set,get}_line` via RPC too.
[17:03:16] <clason[m]> no

[17:03:59] <clason[m]> not necessarily
[17:04:26] <bfredl> at least, it is an anti-goal to add more C API functions just for lua convenience. API functions are added to expose functionality that before was impossible/cumbersome to access from any script/RPC.
[17:04:35] <clason[m]> Lua can have "convenience functions", while the RPC API is much more restricted 
[17:04:50] <bfredl> then wrappers can be written in each target language, lua is no different :]
[17:04:53] <clason[m]> remote plugins are more opaque and can deal with adding their own boilerplate
[17:06:42] <bfredl> especially with buffer indexing, many languages would add wrapper to make buffers look like "native" array indexing. this is what python does for instance, with `buf[line]` and `buf[start:end]`. 
[17:06:54] <bfredl> lua doesn't have a standard for range indexing tho..
[17:08:24] <numToStr[m]> Understood. Thanks to both of you. I learned something new today :)
[17:08:52] <clason[m]> That's what this (or, rather, the dev) channel is for :)

So basically I need to match from my `static_part` until I hit either of: closing bracket (`)`), comma, or end of line. I have a problem with matching if there is  comma in brackets - I want it to be part of match until closing `)` in that case. Came up with something like this (not in vim
[23:00:06] <gegoune[m]> though) that almost works: `/static_part (?:([^)]+))[^,]+/g` , but doesn't match closing `)`s. I don't think it's valid in vim anyway.

[23:48:17] <ChrisKipp[m]>  Hey, I had this conversation a bit over in the telescope channel since that's where I hit on it, but I'm curious about cases where `vim.ui.select` is used and how the default implementation in core is blocking, but then in other plugins that may override it, like https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-ui-select.nvim, is not, which can break assumptions about something working
[23:49:12] <ChrisKipp[m]> for example as a plugin author you can have something like this... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/24141d5dd7ef772977237d0cf2199540f2b9b5fa)
[23:50:01] <ChrisKipp[m]> the situation I hit on it is when the client is answering an LSP request that requires input, so it needs to block since a return value is needed
[23:50:49] <ChrisKipp[m]> I can imagine even if core if something like `showMessageRequest` got rewrote to use this (which I can imagine is reasonable) https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/be768be6b7ee896277971593e9287a86bc41efb2/runtime/lua/vim/lsp/handlers.lua#L80-L98, then with certail plugins this may break if it's not blocking
[23:51:21] <ChrisKipp[m]> I'm just curious if others have hit on this, or if people have already started to come up with solutions for this to ensure that it works?
[23:51:42] <ChrisKipp[m]> I see in some convos that plenary async is mentioned, but wasn't really able to get it to work with that either

[23:55:49] <ChrisKipp[m]> I'm just woried to have an implementation that works in the core `vim.ui.select` behavior, but then breaks with a user decides to use `<your favorite ui plugin>`
