[03:57:24] *** Quits: _inky (inky_@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/inky) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[04:11:37] <Roey> Joanna: well now Trudeau's going full-tyrant
[04:11:46] <Roey> Joanna: I hope the truckers prevail.
[04:12:44] <Roey> do you realize Canada is no longer a democracy, when the government has the power to encourage banks to (without a warrant) freeze and suspend your bank account on mere suspicion that you've donated to the truckers?
[04:12:51] <Roey> this is a tyranny.
[04:13:03] <Roey> Trudeau's "Emergencies Act".
[04:13:46] *** Joins: _inky (inky_@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/inky)
[04:21:49] <Joanna> Roey: it seems like a set up from the getgo by someone like soros
[04:26:10] <Roey> the setup from the get go was the power grab that was the mandate and vax mandate
[04:26:24] <Roey> people are sick and tired of this
[04:26:33] <Roey> just like in the united states
[04:26:37] <Roey> it's become a power thing
[04:27:20] <Roey> if Montgomery County decided a couple of weeks ago to let the mask mandates expire on the 21st, then what the f*** is the difference between then and now such that they couldn't do it effective immediately
[04:27:36] <Roey> it's a power thing, and they want to save face
[04:27:38] <Roey> that's why.
[04:31:31] <Joanna> The law Trudeau has enacted apparently is some domestic terrorist law that has been lurking for a number of years
[04:32:00] <Roey> yeah, he found a way to sneak it in.
[04:32:05] <Roey> i.e. to enact it
[04:32:32] <Joanna> So they have just declared the truckers domestic terrorists and their supporters terrorist supporters
[04:35:32] <Roey> right.
[04:35:57] <Joanna> This thing also reminds me of that thing last year when trump said election was stolen and lured a lot of foolish people to Washington DC and then they got busted for going into capital. At least the non fed portion of the crowd that is :)
[04:36:03] <Roey> I mean Trudeau is a slimy fuck.  He also accused a conservative member of parliament with "siding with Swastikas"
[04:36:06] <Roey> a Jewish MP
[04:36:30] <Roey> Joanna: oh, when the police opened the doors of the Capitol and ushered folks in?
[04:36:37] <Roey> this is not the same as that
[04:37:13] <Joanna> Politicians are just puppets in a puppet show. Don’t waste your time getting mad at them...
[04:37:36] <Roey> like Biden?  He's a Weekend at Bernie's sock puppet.
[04:37:40] <Roey> sure
[04:37:59] <Joanna> It’s not same exactly but it still involves a large crowd of people being lured somewhere then busted
[04:38:10] <Roey> aye
[04:38:13] <Roey> well
[04:38:20] <Roey> ]these peopel are not being lured from what I can see
[04:38:36] <Joanna> I’ve heard Biden has written some interesting laws for Congress
[04:38:49] <Roey> oh his handlers have all sorts of plans
[04:38:55] <Roey> like crippling American energy independence, for one
[04:38:58] <Roey> which was done from Day 1
[04:39:03] <Joanna> They were lured to Ontario right?
[04:39:09] <Roey> no
[04:39:27] <Roey> not that i can see, in the sense of the word "lured".
[04:40:01] <Joanna> It’s pretty standard to prey on disgruntled people and use them as tools
[04:40:26] <Roey> sure
[04:41:11] <Joanna> What they should have done is quietly stop serving places with policies they don’t like
[04:42:09] <Roey> ha
[04:42:30] <Roey> thisi s coming to DC too btw
[04:42:37] <Roey> from California to DC there is a convoy on its way
[04:42:41] <Joanna> In any case they will most likely be rounded up and busted and possibly have their kids confiscated by the government
[04:43:34] <Joanna> Once they crush the Canadian truckers those other protests will probably fizzle out.
[04:44:12] <Roey> we shall see.
[04:44:28] <Roey> if they "round up" and "bust" them, that could lead to somehting bigger.
[04:44:39] <Joanna> I feel sorry for the people duped into being sacrificed
[04:44:54] <Roey> oh you side against the protest?
[04:44:55] <Roey> I see
[04:45:04] <Roey> I don't think their sacrifice is in vain though.
[04:45:35] <Roey> in AMerica there would be antifa and BLM joining in to fuck things up
[04:45:43] <Joanna> The government gets away with bad things all the time and people look the other way or rationalize it.
[04:46:10] <Roey> this protest stands against that
[04:46:13] <Joanna> Antifa and blm are also funded by soros
[04:46:21] <Roey> also did you hear what happened in san francisco yesterday
[04:46:33] <Joanna> It’s just a different flavor of people power revolution
[04:46:40] <Joanna> No what ?
[04:47:03] <Roey> furious parents voted out three lefty members of the school council
[04:47:09] <Roey> by like.. 78% to 28% on average
[04:47:19] *** Quits: Zwolf12 (mosh@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/zwolf12) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[04:47:21] <Roey> these are people who set educational policy
[04:47:32] <Roey> it's amazing that this happened in San Fran
[04:48:19] <Joanna> People should not send their kids to public school to begin with if they don’t want then brainwashed. You can vote all you like they will just put in new puppets no problem:)
[04:49:06] <Roey> and that is why mnore and more parents are home-schooling thier children
[04:51:34] <Joanna> That’s a good thing
[04:52:54] <Roey> assuredly so
[04:53:27] <Joanna> Public school is for the benefit of people who want cannon fodder. It was invented by the Prussians after their soldiers refused to fight French and decided to retreat I believe.
[04:55:33] <Roey> I believe in public school--just not as administered currently by fascists
[04:55:41] <Roey> like in California
[04:55:54] <Roey> who devote more time to renaming schools than getting shit done
[04:55:56] <Joanna> They were furious about people thinking independently about not getting themselves killed :)
[04:56:06] <Roey> ah
[04:56:45] <Joanna> They get stuff done they mess up a lot of kids and turn them into stupid adults...
[04:57:14] <Roey> yeah.
[04:57:26] <Roey> it's out of control in some places.
[04:57:29] * jan6 agrees more with Roey than Joanna, of course ;P
[04:57:34] <Roey> !!!! why??
[04:57:48] <Roey> I wasn't aware that Joanna and I were disagreeing all that much?
[04:57:58] <jan6> 03:25 <Roey> I believe in public school--just not as administered currently by fascists
[04:58:02] <Joanna> What’s out of control?
[04:58:20] <Joanna> I didn’t know we were disagreeing?
[04:58:34] <Roey> Joanna: teachers, teachers' unions and school boards.
[04:58:44] <jan6> not disagreeing, just a bit different approaches, imho
[04:58:59] <Roey> the whole notion that teachers don't have to answer to parents, regarding what they are teaching their kids
[04:59:19] <Roey> jan6: ahh ok
[04:59:22] <jan6> Joanna thinks schools shouldn't exist at all, and people should get taught by parents, and learn themselves, and Roey thinks current school system isn't that great, but schools themselves are fine, at least from what I've gathered, dunno if I'm wrong
[04:59:28] <Roey> ahhhh
[04:59:44] <Roey> I mean, I am pointing to three separate faults in the schooling system
[04:59:52] <Roey> teachers, teachers' unions, school boards.
[05:00:08] <Roey> I have cousins and friends who were home schooled
[05:00:18] <Roey> since before it was cool, even.
[05:01:18] <jan6> imho, one of the major faults is pushing more and more data, and increasingly complicated stuff, AND relying on memorization, instead of focusing on actually learning things for a reason
[05:01:22] <Joanna> Of course not. School is not for the benefit of children it’s for the benefit of the people who own the country. Schools were once voluntary places that children of different ages would gather to learn reading writing and arithmetic. Children would help teach younger children. It was called the one room schoolhouse.
[05:01:27] <jan6> but having a common base knowledge, is great
[05:02:02] <jan6> school IS for the benefit of the children, in that you won't have MASSIVE knowledge inequality
[05:02:27] <Roey> aye
[05:02:30] <Joanna> I know someone home schooled who is addicted to studying
[05:02:35] <jan6> sure
[05:02:55] <jan6> but that's like "one thief stopped stealing once they got a proper job, therefore all thieves are wrongfully punished"
[05:02:59] <Joanna> Public school makes people hate/fear learning
[05:03:12] <jan6> kinda agree, somewhat
[05:03:37] <jan6> without schools, things would be even worse, tho
[05:08:17] <jan6> solution is to figure out a better way to get knowledge across, instead of removing schools entirely
[05:08:41] <jan6> and of course, you are not the only people who recognize how stressful and inefficient the education system is
[05:10:24] <Roey> I mena look
[05:10:27] <Roey> schools in the 50s
[05:10:39] <Roey> they were good at turning out responsible citizens
[05:10:47] <Roey> (racism aside)
[05:10:50] <jan6> problem is, it's HARD to both figure out an actually better system, AND have it not cost much more money (because capitalism over all, so can't have something like <=10 person classes, instead of the 20+ ones)
[05:11:35] <jan6> modern schools were designed as mini-factories for kids, who then grew up to become responsible factory-workers, for the most part
[05:11:58] <jan6> they had only school's information, for the most part, plus whatever came from radio and TV
[05:12:01] <jan6> and news
[05:12:18] <jan6> nowdays, kids get a smartphone at f*in toddler age, quite often
[05:12:51] <jan6> and as such, things aren't just about what is taught officially, but also what is not NOT taught
[05:14:54] <jan6> e.g. you might get a great new idea on how to make fun of that weirdo kid, by watching a youtube video, or a film, sure sure, bullying is bad, yada yada, but you never learn actually WHY it's bad, because "hey, it's fun! like what, I didn't injure him, he's fiiiiinee!"
[05:15:41] <jan6> or you might learn about flat earth, and then not get why you're taught it's a globe, because the flat earth arguments are much more convincing
[05:15:43] <jan6> etc
[05:16:03] <jan6> the problem is that there's a lot of conflicting info
[05:16:08] <Joanna> The culture of 1950s was different.
[05:16:11] <jan6> and you gotta learn yourself, how to filter them out
[05:16:20] <jan6> culture was also more black and white, sure
[05:16:25] <jan6> both literally, and figuratively
[05:16:47] <Joanna> They still turned out dumb people but at least they wanted to be married and have families
[05:17:20] <jan6> "wanting to be married" is not a positive or a negative
[05:17:27] <jan6> it should be a CHOICE, not a chore
[05:17:34] <jan6> it just has to balance out ON AVERAGE
[05:17:48] <jan6> marriage is pretty dumb anyway, nowdays
[05:17:51] <Joanna> After the 1950s they decided that families are not necessarily because government is better
[05:18:14] <Roey> that's communists
[05:18:15] <jan6> because main point of marriage throughout time was attempting to control sexual diseases, pretty much
[05:18:26] <Roey> communists decided they know better than the parents 
[05:18:44] <jan6> also communism was horrible, erasing all cultures not their own
[05:18:50] <Roey> yes
[05:18:50] <jan6> some more than others
[05:19:49] <Joanna> Black people used to get married and be supported by the father just like everyone else. One man could support his family and live well in 1950s then they decided to create women’s lib...
[05:19:56] <Roey> yeah
[05:20:06] <Roey> well I don't know so much about ":women's lib"
[05:20:17] <Roey> women's suffrage is a good thing in my book
[05:21:31] <Joanna>  Suffrage is irrelevant because all candidates are picked beforehand. The uncontrolled candidates are ignored by news media and have no chance of being elected
[05:22:33] <Joanna> In the 1960s the birth control pill was invented and women were “liberated “
[05:23:53] <Joanna> They also had incentives to be single mothers
[05:25:38] <Roey> ahh
[05:28:34] <jan6> all of which is great
[05:29:02] <jan6> because your role in life, shouldn't be defined by who you were born as
[05:35:21] <Roey> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[05:35:27] <Roey> this
[05:40:43] <Joanna> Also men were encouraged to be irresponsible kidalts
[05:41:10] <Roey> very much so, yes.
[05:41:30] <Joanna> It’s just like the Seinfeld shoe
[05:41:42] <Roey> whazat

[05:42:10] <Joanna> Sorry typo

[05:53:58] <Roey> not the shoe

[05:54:22] <Roey> ok then

[06:31:25] <Joanna> Also marriage is for the purpose making and bringing up children in most cases. And fidelity certainly reduces diseases as a side effect.
