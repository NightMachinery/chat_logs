[02:22:25] <Decker> linearbit given the proposed direction; I'd probably just generate sqlite table(I dunno at that point, if I had the data, it wouldn't need to be a table sql's not really going to offer much for features) but you can define user functions in sqlite; but you'd have to pass all the values as parameters... I guess there's table valued functions or virtual tables but then, you're back to SQL doesn't really do math that well; and you'd already have to have it

[02:34:40] <PlanckWalk> linearbit: Another approach is to store components with their index
[02:35:20] <PlanckWalk> One advantage is that you can use simple joins to get dot products.
[02:36:07] <PlanckWalk> (Just join on equal indices and sum the product)
[02:36:43] <PlanckWalk> It won't be especially efficient, though.

[02:40:01] <linearbit> For an accurate solution I do need a linear scan

[04:50:58] <jtgd> In the Pentium, RDTSC—Read Time-Stamp Counter reads a 64 bit value which counts clock cycles. I guess the upper 32 bits is approximately seconds, but my question is, as the CPU adjusts it's own clock to meet the load, does that change the rate that this is incremented?

[06:49:28] <PlanckWalk> Well, at an industry average of <100 LOC/day, the answer should be about 3 lines long.
[06:49:34] <norias> heh
[06:49:53] <pulse> 5-10 minute problem under pressure reveals just about nothing about dev's skill
[06:50:02] <norias> PlanckWalk: what language, though...
[06:50:25] <norias> PlanckWalk: me and another student each did a socket programming assignment where we had choice of language
[06:50:27] <PlanckWalk> Brainfuck, since it doesn't even have line breaks
[06:50:40] <norias> my C++ version was significantly longer than his python
[06:50:41] <PlanckWalk> So any solution is automatically 1 line long
[06:51:38] <Irishmanluke> ok implement a brainfuck interpreter 
[06:51:41] <Irishmanluke> perfect
[06:52:26] <Irishmanluke> except we'll call it mindmash
[06:52:28] <norias> eh. good luck with that
[06:53:12] <PlanckWalk> I was pretty serious about the 3 lines long though.
[06:53:38] <norias> maybe better to just whiteboard something 
[06:53:45] <norias> without too much actual code
[06:53:54] <norias> pseudo code
[06:54:06] <pulse> i find these interview questions really stupid
[06:54:11] <norias> isn't solving the problem what you really care about?
[06:54:33] <pulse> the most you can hope for to gain from them is weeding out the completely incompetent people
[06:54:37] <Irishmanluke> well there's what I care about and there's what my boss cares about
[06:55:07] <Irishmanluke> If I could weed out the really incompetent people that would be good
[06:55:21] <pulse> i can implement some pretty damn advanced crap if you give me a few days. ask me something under pressure and i'll forget how to calculate remainders
[06:55:25] <pulse> :p
[06:56:01] <PlanckWalk> I'll probably spend more than 10 minutes clarifying problem requirements
[06:56:06] <norias> Irishmanluke: fill me in, man, because this hiring process stuff for programming seems like a mystery
[06:56:19] <pulse> if i ever start hiring for my studio i'll give everyone a task to implement tetris in 2 days, and that gives you a lot more information about the person
[06:56:20] <norias> i'm about ready to say to hell with it, haha
[06:56:27] <PlanckWalk> Unless you spend *a lot more* time on devising the problem than asking for suggestions on IRC the day before the interview :-p
[06:57:01] <ski> (i guess people tend to measure what's easy to measure, rather than necessarily what's relevant to measure)
[06:57:24] <PlanckWalk> Fibonacci you say?  Should the function handle negative integers?  Arbitrary precision?  What about non-integers via analytic continuation? etc.

[06:59:14] <pulse> actually the best question i can think of for an interview is `do you have any cool projects`
[06:59:35] <pulse> if someone has projects and the code is available you can go through it and get a good picture of their skill within about 10 mintues
[06:59:52] <pulse> and if they don't have projects they're not good anyway
[07:00:17] <PlanckWalk> And if they do have projects and code isn't available then they don't Open Source enough so off they go
[07:00:27] <pulse> but that whole "implement fizzbuzz on this whiteboard", i'd honestly just walk away. tells me the employer is a damn fool
[07:00:43] <PlanckWalk> pulse: What if it's an electronic whiteboard.
[07:00:57] <pulse> i may stay to play with it :p
[07:01:00] <PlanckWalk> It would be so cool to open it up and fiddle with the electronics to implement fizzbuzz
[07:01:23] <edgar-rft> what if I have lots of projects but none of them has anything to do with code?
[07:01:50] <pulse> then they're not relevant for showcasing your coding skills :p

[07:22:04] <norias> i'd have to count
[07:22:32] <norias> i'm on a pace of applying for 2-3 every day
[07:22:38] <Irishmanluke> you're not even getting any calls?
[07:22:44] <hololeap> probably the same as anything else. make friends, get (really) good, offer something novel that has value... then eventually maybe somebody will give you money for it

[07:40:27] <norias> i'll figure it out
[07:40:36] <mven> colleges and local/state government usually have entry-level programming jobs that aren't as challenging to get into like competitive startups. Not as glamorous, but you'll get your foot in the door for other opportunities by gaining solid work experience.

[08:50:24] <spine-o-saurus> no, but the total number of objects does influence the gravity
[08:50:36] <spine-o-saurus> thats why I was trying to find out how to do that
[08:50:55] <flakland> is a simulator? ifyes: everything is in potential orbit
[08:52:29] <spine-o-saurus> kind of, it should be able to track how many objects are in play to determine gravity force
[08:53:43] <spine-o-saurus> the only thing i could think of was to assign uuid to each object and then somehow run a logic to tell if it is still in orbit?
[08:54:54] <flakland> universal gravity force?
[08:55:16] <spine-o-saurus> no some are different
[08:56:02] <flakland> spheres or cubes, that is the question
[08:56:38] <spine-o-saurus> i think they are cubes
[08:56:39] <epony> C creatures
[08:56:54] <Decker> what sort of things are orbiting the other thing?  If they are small like asteroids their gravity effect is neglegable
[08:57:12] <epony> unless they are a lot
[08:57:32] <epony> like in the planet formation range of a lot
[08:57:35] <Decker> even then - the net force will be if if there's 'a lot' because of Newtons shell theorum
[08:57:38] <spine-o-saurus> the mass is always the same so that is not in the equation
[08:57:56] <Decker> will be zero
[08:58:02] <spine-o-saurus> all objects are equal in otherwords

[11:45:51] <vysn> inside of a virtual world, when someone owns a unique one of kind item, that item usually becomes very valuable. However, if everyone can own an item that is also unique and one of a kind in that virtual world, will that make unique and one of a kind items hold less value? any thoughts?

[11:46:39] <Decker> sure
[11:47:00] <Decker> that's the idea of NFT - but to show it locally you have to have it in memory ; so there's not a lot to stop you from cloning it
[11:47:17] <Decker> because programmers suck, and will just write a custom tool that does the same thing but differently
[11:47:20] <Decker> :)
[11:47:57] <arahael> Also, the actual NFT's themselves have pitifully few protections applied to them.
[11:48:05] <arahael> It's almost like it's mocking "non-fungible" as a concept.
[11:48:23] <Decker> https://www.osgrid.org/
[11:48:42] <arahael> Not only do they fail to try and demonstrate that you actually own the item before you do the NFT thing itself - but the  NFT thing is usually only proving the reference - could be just a URL or something.
[11:48:53] <Decker> second life similary - they have an inventory server that tracks permissions on objects
[11:48:55] <arahael> So the actual *monkey image*, as an example, isn't neccessarily part of the NFT thing.
[11:49:28] *** Joins: MatSharrow (~matthew@117.20.9.51.dyn.plus.net)
[11:49:37] <Decker> it makes it hard using their client to clone items... and you can't really ust have a different client and upload 'hey you forgot I had this' so you can't duplicate within their world except where allowed - but you could take those to a server like OSGrid and import them
[11:49:43] <Decker> especially in your own hypergrid node
[11:49:57] <Decker> and then when others visit your node they can get those, and bring them back to their own grids
[11:50:09] <Decker> and you have what you have with you when you transport to another node

[11:52:26] <Decker> in the hypergrid - there is a difference between logging in to say OSGrid main portal, andhaving that account identifier, vs logging into your node, and transporting to another node; even if you end up forcing the same UUID(?)

[11:57:00] <paulo> how do I become a happy programmer?
[11:57:09] <PlanckWalk> First, become a programmer.

[11:58:17] <PlanckWalk> Like rocket science
[11:58:28] <Decker> like programming, having somethnig to program is 90% of the problem; grinning is 90% of the way to happy :)

[15:14:11] <bjs> It would just look strange compared to how we build hardware today
[15:15:09] <bjs> In the end you'll always be able to dig down far enough where the hardware will stop looking "functional" though,  but that's okay because one of the reasons we design high-level languages is to abstract over the low level hardware

[15:24:06] <pikapika> That is a meaningless formulation, any procedural stateful program could be stated in that format, in fact that is how a turing machine is formulated
[15:24:51] <pikapika> Which is why I maintain, in the real life programming pertains to the applied aspects like time/memory bounds, how efficiently the cpu is being operated etc
[15:25:15] <pikapika> The lambda/turing formulations are not useful in a direct manner
[15:26:05] <pyzozord> wait are cpus purely functional?
[15:26:09] <bjs> lambda calculus and turing machines are mathematical machines, not physical ones.
[15:26:13] <pyzozord> they have registers
[15:26:19] <novns> pikapika, but with pure mathematical functional language you can optimize your program formally so there will be nothing to run
[15:26:42] <GeDaMo> The registers are part of the state

[15:26:56] <bjs> pyzozord: well what exactly a CPU "is" is not easy to say,  there are certainly some parts that are pure. Really the CPU is just a big mess of asynchronosuly communicating units. Some of them have state (like the register banks) but others are pure functions (like arithmetic units)
[15:27:02] <pikapika> Shifting more and more calculation to the compile time
[15:27:13] <bjs> pyzozord: I'm dubious about claims either way about assigning one paradigm to something as big and complicated as a modern CPU
[15:27:23] <novns> pikapika, no you don't
[15:27:32] <pyzozord> yeah, maybe things don't fit in neat boxes
[15:27:39] <novns> C++ templates are ugly as hell, impossible to debug
[15:27:39] <pikapika> Any problem that could have been reduced to a nop in that manner would anyways have been done so using traditional mathematical study of the problem anyways, there is no need for any particular programming language
[15:28:03] <pikapika> Programming languages are irrelevant to the type of reduction you are taling about
[15:28:16] <pyzozord> if things don't fit in neat boxes, my intiona response of "pfft" to "functional is granite and imperative is limescale" is an appropriate response

[23:31:26] <nomagno> Just returning a struct, same syntax kinda
[23:31:34] <ProfSimm> sonny: depends on the language. Swift marries the convenience of null with the type-safety of Optional<>

[23:36:25] <koollman> exceptions are somewhat nice, but they require some discipline too
[23:36:40] <deniska> exceptions are not great, not terrible, certainly beats checking error codes, especially in-band

[23:36:52] <sonny> user51: I define a type as a set of values
[23:36:57] <ProfSimm> Like in the middle of an algebraic expression

[23:37:43] <user51> sonny: so something like say 0-255?
[23:37:43] <koollman> ProfSimm: you can provide ways to restart the execution after handling the exception
[23:38:01] <sonny> ProfSimm: you don't have to return Result|Error, you could just send a message
[23:38:05] <koollman> ProfSimm: so, you can have "well, we failed because the file isn't there, so, create it, then go on as if it was there initially"
[23:38:06] <ProfSimm> koollman: let's say it's an out of memory error, what would I restart.

[23:41:15] <ProfSimm> koolazer: maybe we can split exceptions into two concepts 1) error 2) help
[23:41:29] <koollman> ProfSimm: the file example isn't hypothetical. I've used it. another practical example is to switch the exception handling entirely, with predefined sets of behaviors. (like "fail and exit", or "ignore, go to next item", or "ask user")

[23:44:33] <sonny> messing with the stack seems the least desireable thing to do
