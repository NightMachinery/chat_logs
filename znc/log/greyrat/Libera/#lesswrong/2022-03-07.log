[00:13:33] <two2thehead> hm. TIL
[00:16:40] <otoburb> My comment was in jest, since ext4 should have been in widespread use by 2010. But this is Bloomberg Media, and who knows what happened there. It wouldn't surprise me that they only just recently managed to complete their filesystem/volume migration to something more modern.

[01:02:06] <ggreer> huh. france has almost 300 nukes and a few ballistic missile submarines. they should ask the rest of the EU for money to keep developing their nuclear capabilities

[02:11:51] <kuudes> galambo__, you don't need a world war for that
[02:11:58] <kuudes> if russia nukes ukraine, there won't be world war
[02:12:03] <kuudes> but there still will be a lot of death
[02:12:42] <kuudes> which is why I have been thinking on what sort of terrorism could ukraine threaten russia with to at least bite putin in the balls while dying
[02:13:14] <kuudes> is sarin easy to make?
[02:17:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... why would you want anything like that to happen
[02:17:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is a truly terrible idea
[02:18:04] <kuudes> it is not more terrible than nukes
[02:18:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> True!
[02:18:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> And what of it?
[02:18:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> The options aren't "nukes, OR, bio-terrorism or something"
[02:19:10] <kuudes> I hold 1-10% chance currently that putin will nuke ukraine before 2024
[02:19:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean that's certainly a range
[02:19:39] <kuudes> today's happening https://twitter.com/IAPonomarenko/status/1500595466580508672 could be false of course
[02:19:41] <Robomot> Illia Ponomarenko üá∫üá¶ (@IAPonomarenko): "My fellow townsmen fleeing Volnovakha tell me lots of dead bodies are scattered in the streets. / Russia simply swept the town of 25,000 off."
[02:20:38] <kuudes> so that is... 3 millihitlers if all of them got murdered?
[02:20:50] <kuudes> wasn't 1 hitler 8 million lives?
[02:21:41] <kuudes> but I have indeed been pondering on what putin personally would not want to lose
[02:21:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> More than that, I should think?
[02:22:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway that tweet sounds pretty false
[02:22:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well no
[02:22:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's obviously false, lol
[02:22:56] <saturn2> idk it seems like the kind of thing that often happens in wars
[02:23:10] <kuudes> https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/dlu96/new_si_unit_one_hitler/ 6 million it seems
[02:23:12] <Robomot> New SI Unit: One Hitler : reddit.com (One hitler shall henceforth be a unit of measurement equal to 6.0*10^6 human deaths. Standard SI prefixes apply. Thus Harold Shipman's...)
[02:23:20] <saturn2> i don't see how it implies anything about nukes though
[02:23:25] <kuudes> so 4 millihitlers
[02:23:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: I think that the entire population of a town all being killed, and then some of those killed people fleeing to tell people about how they've all been killed, happens never, because it's physically impossible...
[02:24:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Also the town in question has a population of ~21.4k, not "25,000", but let's not quibble I guess)
[02:24:16] <kuudes> yes. likely less, maybe half, maybe 1/4.
[02:24:20] <kuudes> indeed
[02:24:31] <kuudes> and could be false as well
[02:25:10] <kuudes> but if you are facing extermination, I don't see it evil if you try to do as much damage as you can to your exterminator
[02:25:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's only so much damage you can do to one guy
[02:25:49] <kuudes> nuke revenge targets innocent people in large cities; that is not good, but still accepted
[02:25:51] <kuudes> indeed
[02:26:01] <kuudes> and I am not sure putin cares of people of moscow even
[02:26:17] <kuudes> which is why I have been thinking on what does he not want to lose
[02:26:39] <kuudes> could there be his children, lovers, pets? his home, palace, church?
[02:26:48] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: all it says is the whole population fled, and also there were some bodies in the streets
[02:27:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: It also says "Russia simply swept the town of off 25,000 off."
[02:27:10] <kuudes> saturn2, yes, and it is unconfirmed
[02:27:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Now either that's blatant lies, or it's ... not a factual statement but instead some sort of hyperbole or something? Either way - not true
[02:27:41] <kuudes> ukrainian side claims russia started shelling at civilians during the agreed evacuation time
[02:27:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> And if we remove that part
[02:27:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then all we have is
[02:27:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> "some people were killed"
[02:28:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which, yes, I believe. Some people have almost certainly been killed.
[02:28:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> How many? Probably at least one or two
[02:28:21] <saturn2> sounds similar to my lai or something
[02:28:49] <kuudes> I don't say this specific case justifies killing all muscovites in itself
[02:29:00] <saturn2> which also didn't indicate that the usa was about to nuke vietnam
[02:29:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, what amuses (but not surprise) me is how people in the West continually vaccilate between "FUCK the Russians, those fucking assholes, nuke them or something" and "the brave Russian people should rise up and depose evil Putin and kill him!!"
[02:29:20] <kuudes> and ukraine clearly currently should not do terrorism, because they have so much international support currently
[02:29:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't know how stupid Westerners think Russians are, but
[02:29:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> They're not stupid enough not to notice this
[02:29:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which means that Putin doesn't even need propaganda to get people on his side
[02:30:06] <kuudes> a lot of people are on his side
[02:30:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> He can just be like "*points to all Western media*"
[02:30:28] <kuudes> he can't because he will censor them though
[02:30:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Kinda missing the point there man
[02:32:27] <kuudes> but yes, it would be nice to learn what putin would miss if it was destroyed
[02:32:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Power
[02:35:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Here's more info about that town: https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/804376.html
[02:35:11] <Robomot> Head of Donetsk Regional State Administration: Volnovakha almost destroyed (Head of Donetsk Regional State Administration Pavlo Kyrylenko has said that Volnovakha is almost destroyed.)
[02:35:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> (That's from a Ukrainian news source, btw)
[02:35:23] <kuudes> thanks
[02:35:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Here's another: https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3414918-russian-invasion-update-volnovakha-town-on-verge-of-humanitarian-catastrophe.html
[02:35:45] <Robomot> Russian invasion update: Volnovakha town on verge of humanitarian catastrophe (The situation regarding the Russian invasion ‚Äî Ukrinform.)
[02:36:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> More recent, Western source: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/nowhere-to-go-back-to-ukraine-volnovakha
[02:36:29] <Robomot> ‚ÄòNowhere to go and nowhere to go back to‚Äô: Life under fire in Ukraine | Ukraine | The Guardian (Marina, an economist and mother of three in Volnovakha, describes her family‚Äôs ordeal and their terrifying escape)
[02:36:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> So... that's from the most pro-UA sources available, and yet: does any of this sound remotely like "thousands of people killed"? No
[02:36:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not even a little
[02:37:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> So please don't suddenly forget that Twitter is full of blatant lies
[02:37:44] <kuudes> as I said, it was an example
[02:37:53] <kuudes> it is not a necessary requirement for terrorism
[02:38:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> An example of what, though? War? Combat? Civilian casualties (in numbers considerably smaller than the average U.S. "intervention" and/or "liberation" etc.)?
[02:39:35] <kuudes> you seem to be pleading in that by accepting terrorism in this one accepts terrorism against usa/nyc, and that would be bad?
[02:40:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> That ship has sailed, but let's examine that analogy, sure:
[02:40:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Say some enterprising Ukrainians follow a similar chain of reasoning and go "dude let's blow up uhhh maybe Moscow State University or something"
[02:40:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then they do, hundreds or thousands of people die
[02:41:02] <kuudes> that sounds ineffective
[02:41:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> (obviously)
[02:41:10] <kuudes> sarin attack to moscow metro would kill more
[02:41:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Missing the point again...
[02:41:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, then Russia retaliates and the resulting operation kills let's say some tens or hundreds of thousands of people
[02:42:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> The world is shocked, shocked!
[02:42:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> But Putin, quite reasonably, says
[02:42:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> "What's wrong, guys? You don't like when we do this? Well where's your outrage at the United States? We're just following their example"
[02:42:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Address their similar prior actions first, then we'll talk about us"
[02:42:47] <kuudes> two wrongs don't make one right
[02:43:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Irrelevant yet again
[02:43:45] <kuudes> you are not getting to your point, it seems to me
[02:43:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> You're being obtuse
[02:44:03] <kuudes> no you
[02:44:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> But here I'll make it explicit
[02:44:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> My point is just that the precedent has been set: the reasonable response to terrorism is to go into a region and kill huge numbers of people at best tangentially related to said terrorism
[02:44:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is a thing that civilized superpowers do and it's fine
[02:44:50] <kuudes> I am already expecting putin will kill 20m ukrainians if they don't manage to flee to poland
[02:44:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> So maybe *don't* advocate for Ukrainians doing terrorism to Russia
[02:45:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Unless you want large numbers of them to die
[02:45:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Personally I don't!
[02:45:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> But ymmv I guess
[02:45:22] <kuudes> no, my point is that I already count them as dead
[02:45:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's... very dumb
[02:45:44] <kuudes> no, that is just the same calculus as with nukes
[02:45:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> What does that even mean? That doesn't mean anything
[02:46:07] <kuudes> you don't mean anything yourself
[02:46:07] <saturn2> this idea that everyone is on a one-dimensional scale from zero to hitler doesn't make any sense
[02:46:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also a fair point
[02:47:29] <kuudes> indeed, stalin exceeded hitler, wasn't it?
[02:47:50] * Obormot\Arcturus facepalm
[02:48:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't know if you're doing it deliberately but it's like your brain has turned off when you talk about this Russia-Ukraine stuff
[02:48:23] <kuudes> sure
[02:49:28] <kuudes> I am just moving the overton window, desensitizing us to mass deaths
[02:49:34] <kuudes> because they might be a good thing
[02:50:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why not step back and consider whether the thing you're saying sounds like something that a psychotic Marvel supervillain would say
[02:50:21] <kuudes> no
[02:50:36] <kuudes> you can stop engaging me, I am not engaging you but responding
[02:50:45] <kuudes> and I have nothing personal against you
[02:50:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure, yeah, why indeed would you want to be sane and not crazy
[02:50:53] <kuudes> indeed
[02:51:18] <kuudes> but instrumental rationality is nice
[02:51:29] <kuudes> so. how does one kill most amount of what putin likes?
[02:51:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, of course mass deaths are not a good thing, only a crazy person or an idiot would think that
[02:51:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> As far as actual discussion of potential terrorist acts, imo that is not appropriate for this channel
[02:51:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> And should not be permitted
[02:52:08] <kuudes> nothing illegal in them
[02:52:16] <kuudes> because ukraine is fighting legal war
[02:53:56] <kuudes> bombing apartment buildings seems suboptimal, though putin seems to engage in such
[02:54:44] <kuudes> but I have to read https://www.gwern.net/Terrorism-is-not-about-Terror again
[02:54:45] <Robomot> Terrorism Is Not About Terror ¬∑ Gwern.net (Terrorists act irrationally from a rational activism perspective, and groups act in ways most consistent with terrorism being about social status and belonging)
[02:55:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Can we perhaps discourage discussions that would get this place investigated by even more TLAs than it probably already is
[02:55:40] <kuudes> https://www.gwern.net/Terrorism-is-not-Effective is better
[02:55:41] <Robomot> Terrorism Is Not Effective ¬∑ Gwern.net (More effective ways to kill = terrorists are stupid, or killing not most important thing to them)
[02:57:59] <saturn2> i think kuudes is on the TLA's side in this, but it does belong in #lw-politics
[02:59:43] <kuudes> point taken. thanks

[06:32:21] <PapuaHardyNet> does your watch correct for base metabolic rate
[06:37:08] <PapuaHardyNet> so EAI is already building a dataset of alignment research
[06:37:59] <PapuaHardyNet> I *assume* a part of the desire to do so is the curiousity of seeing what happens if we finetune a huge language model on the dataset.
[06:40:31] <adiabatic> I think so. There's a number for total calories burned and exercise calories burned
[06:40:37] <adiabatic> er, two separate numbers
[06:43:26] <PapuaHardyNet> if you've walked for 5-7 hours straight, then it makes sense to say that you've burned ~1500 calories, based on the metrics given here: https://www.exercise.com/learn/burning-calories/#calories-burned-per-hour-(based-on-weight)

[07:17:22] <PapuaHardyNet> s/we/he/
[07:18:08] <PapuaHardyNet> shawwn assumed that if evolutionary algorithms developed humans, and humans are surprisingly bad at wireheading, then perhaps that is the breakthrough we need to prevent AGI that will immediately wirehead
[07:18:57] <PapuaHardyNet> I may be wrong, shawwn. If I am, just give me a heads up.
[07:21:15] <PapuaHardyNet> I do think that this doesn't actually seem like a real solution. Humans aren't very good at wireheading because we don't have a clear "reward function", due to multiple overlapping and conflicting desires, especially due to hyperbolic discounting
[07:21:49] <PapuaHardyNet> optimizing for noise is harder than it sounds
[07:22:25] <quanticle> It's also why trying to reduce people to "utility functions" is hard
[07:22:42] <PapuaHardyNet> evening quant
[07:22:46] <quanticle> Evening
[07:25:12] <PapuaHardyNet> but yes, humans *right now* aren't very good at optimizing for their reward function, but given enough intelligence and technology (which we might already have: see VR) humans can come very close to wireheading
[07:25:15] <quanticle> adiabatic: I'm with Obormot\Arcturus on that potato slicer. It's way too specialized to justify the space
[07:25:48] <quanticle> Heck, my mom exiled her air fryer to the basement because she wanted countertop space
[07:25:59] <PapuaHardyNet> we have already bypassed the fact that sex as a reward was aa proxy for making humans reproduce, given enough time we'll have effectively wireheaded
[07:26:12] <PapuaHardyNet> s/as a reward/was rewarding/
[07:26:26] <quanticle> Yeah, that's true. We'll figure it out eventually
[07:27:12] <nshepperd2> it seemed like a bad argument to me
[07:27:42] <nshepperd2> maybe he just wanted something to be contrarian about
[07:27:46] <PapuaHardyNet> the evolutionary one? I don't even recall the argument really, it didn't make sense to me either
[07:28:18] <PapuaHardyNet> I guess I'm steelmanning his argument, which is still acceptable since even the steelman isn't correct
[07:28:40] <PapuaHardyNet> the conclusion is this: we need a new framework for what superintelligent agents maximize
[07:29:11] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't *think* we can continue to try to create more and more intricate and complicated reward functions to keep up with the intelligence of AGI
[07:29:22] <nshepperd2> as i recall his argument was that evolution has invented general intelligence, and people haven't yet, therefore extrapolate from n=1 with certainty
[07:29:58] <PapuaHardyNet> that doesn't make sense, yeah

[09:39:54] <PlanckWalk> I can embed a model of hostile superintelligence
[09:40:13] <PlanckWalk> It's a shitty model, but that's true of modelling anything smarter than oneself.
[09:43:44] <PapuaHardyNet> brutalist is my favorite GW theme
[09:46:09] <quanticle> I think the idea is that a friendly but corrigible AI could be turned into an unfriendly AI if it models a hostile AI, or something
[09:52:13] <PapuaHardyNet> I mean, surely the idea of hostile superintelligences isn't a memetic hazard
[09:52:30] <PapuaHardyNet> s/memetic/cognitive/
[09:52:48] <PapuaHardyNet> s/cognitive/cognitive\/info/
[09:55:32] <PapuaHardyNet> one model of how the idea of hostile superintelligences could be a hazard is if the AI decides to model an adverserial entity that promises it... something, in exchange for, say, destroying humanity
[09:56:12] <PapuaHardyNet> thing is that this is a general subset of the "complexity of value" and the "reward maximizer" problem, so it is not something we should be worrying about
[09:58:50] <nshepperd2> maybe it would break out of the simulation by hacking the AI's mind
[10:01:24] <PapuaHardyNet> if you try to use this to achieve immortality, either your simulation needs to be smarter than the AI to be able to do so, or you should have been smarter than the AI to have orchestrated the environment such that a compressed hacker version of you was loaded into the AI mind
[10:02:03] <PapuaHardyNet> (and if you were already smarter than the AI beforehand, not only does it make no sense for you to try this, but you also are vulnerable to this exact "hack" if it was plausible)
[10:04:11] <nshepperd2> i mean if you're not very strategic about what you think about
[10:04:54] <nshepperd2> and you start thinking "what would a hostile superintelligence do? oh, it would try to find a memetic hazard tailored to my brain? like what?" and then actually find one
[10:05:01] <nshepperd2> that's bad
[10:06:19] <nshepperd2> quanticle: wow it's the computer that the hacker guy in every action movie carries around everywhere
[10:06:39] <PapuaHardyNet> heheh
[10:07:04] <saturn2> i think the idea is that the AI's thoughts would be detailed enough to themselves be people that feel pain
[10:07:52] <nshepperd2> or that yeah
[10:10:47] <PapuaHardyNet> oh god, it's a bit more complicated than both what we were talking about and what saturn3 is referencing
[10:10:50] <PapuaHardyNet> "Thus, a local AI that models a distant superintelligence that uses a logical decision theory may model that distant superintelligence as behaving as though it could control the AI‚Äôs model of its choices via its choices.
[10:10:58] <PapuaHardyNet> Thus, the local AI would model the distant superintelligence as probably creating lots of AIs that it can‚Äôt distinguish from itself, and update accordingly on the most probable cause of its sense events." https://arbital.greaterwrong.com/p/probable_environment_hacking?l=5j
[10:11:00] <Robomot> Distant superintelligences can coerce the most probable environment of your AI - Arbital viewer (Distant superintelligences may be able to hack your local AI, if your AI's preference framework depends on its most probable environment.)
[10:13:33] <PapuaHardyNet> what I'm getting here is, let's say you assume an AI exists that is modelling copies of you that you cannot distinguish from yourself. therefore it is plausible to assume that you may be in a simulation and your observations are being manipulated by this AI.
[10:14:21] <PapuaHardyNet> but I don't get how we go from this, to "Then the superintelligence can change arbitrary features of the most likely facts about the environment." yeah okay you are in a simulation. So what? That doesn't necessarily change your best strategy for your next action

[15:38:09] <cyberjunkie> Yep
[15:39:15] <PapuaHardyNet> hey gurkenglas. What do you mean by "the determinant definition sure is justified by its properties"? I mean, yeah it is but are you implying something specific?
[15:41:22] <gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet: You were talking a day or two back about whether one should use code or math to think about one is doing with one's neural networks
[15:41:59] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, I do recall the context, and I did plan on answering your message but the confusion regarding your comment about determinant threw me off
[15:42:50] <gurkenglas> It was trying to guess at the distinction you're pointing at - would you say that math is to code as a differential equation like f'=f is to its solution, here exp?
[15:43:57] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm? not really. I think of them as sets of symbols that represent the same computable functions
[15:44:02] <feep[work]> that sounds so sarcastic XD
[15:44:20] <feep[work]> yeah the determinant definition sure is justified by its properties :rolls eyes:
[15:44:22] <gurkenglas> feep, which of the two of us?
[15:44:38] <gurkenglas> Ah, I see
[15:45:43] <PapuaHardyNet> what I was getting at - and what I believed you would be interested in - is the question about the relative advantage of doing research - of thinking of possible problems and solutions - in math and in code (and pseudocode, which is like a moderate route)
[15:46:42] <PapuaHardyNet> I believed, and claimed, that while writing code, especially minimal PoC code, helps, the increase in number of symbols means that your ability to keep the problem in your head, and explore its implications, is lessened
[15:47:02] <gurkenglas> I usually do the math side, but trying to actually implement something led me to some computational tricks that feel too convenient to be coincidence
[15:47:13] <PapuaHardyNet> I also implicitly believed that both formalisms, code and math, would have the same - or similar - level of rigor, at least for ML research and AI alignment research
[15:47:46] <PlanckWalk> It's not even just the number of symbols. It's also the fact that those symbols are describing how to do the thing, not what the thing is or does or what makes it useful.
[15:48:21] <PlanckWalk> House design by examining a list of instructions to a builder.
[15:48:28] <gurkenglas> Diffeq vs. its solution seemed relevant because I'd expect a lot of cases where you write ten lines of code that can be described as the solution to one line of math
[15:48:30] <PlanckWalk> "Nail here, here, and here"
[15:49:41] <PlanckWalk> Well, I guess there are languages that are less imperative. Even then it's a lot more imperative than math.
[15:49:58] <gurkenglas> Not because code libraries are more verbose than math libraries, but for the same reason that proofs can be (ludicrously) longer than what they prove
[15:50:49] <PapuaHardyNet> hold on, how does the length of proof come into this picture
[15:50:53] <gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet: Sometimes you can tell what a function does just from looking at the type signature. Does that capture what you're saying?
[15:52:05] <PapuaHardyNet> gurkenglas: not exactly? I meant to say that f(x) = x + 3, and (defun f (x) (+ x 3)) represent the same computation
[15:53:14] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm. I guess the crux is this: what computations are harder to represent via code, that are easier to represent with math?
[15:53:26] <gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet: If it's literally just about which syntax you use to say the same things in the same way, this sounds like bikeshedding
[15:53:32] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't think there's a real distinction, yeah
[15:54:23] <PapuaHardyNet> well, another question I had is what provides you more advantage in your work. Working in math notation versus working with minimal code
[15:54:49] <PapuaHardyNet> you use math more often, and I assume that is because it is just faster to iterate through possibilities using math. is that correct?
[15:55:14] <gurkenglas> (I brought in length of proof because every type signature corresponds to the statement "this type has an implementation" and then an implementation is a proof, and it turns out this lets you do everything you can do in logic)
[15:55:17] <PapuaHardyNet> And once you feel like you have hit upon something that you believe has potential, you then try verifying it by making a minimal code implementation?
[15:56:36] <PapuaHardyNet> additionally, do you ever find yourself working with "pseudocode" instead of actual math notation or actual minimal code implementations? I think using pseudocode may be the worst of both worlds, but I may be wrong
[15:57:16] <gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet: Sometimes I have math that doesn't correspond to any code, like "entropy is the only functor such that _". Sometimes I have code that doesn't correspond to any math, like "pop from the heap until i find a node that still has all neighbors"

[15:59:32] <PapuaHardyNet> do you mean that they are significantly more difficult to describe in the native notation, compared to what they are good at? That makes sense. I guess you just create fluency both ways and use what notation is most convenient to you at whatever stage you are at
[16:00:05] <gurkenglas> "they" referring to which? "native" meaning what?
[16:00:41] <PapuaHardyNet> writing an operation that involves higher order functions is easier to write in math but harder to write in code
[16:00:52] <gurkenglas> it is? give an example
[16:01:11] <PapuaHardyNet> writing a heap operation is easier to write in code because the notation implicitly assumes heaps exist, compared to using math
[16:02:07] <PapuaHardyNet> I was asking you if that is what you meant, not claiming that was true. I do think that if you use something like Java it is clearly true, but if you use Lisp or Haskell, the overhead is almost non-existent
[16:03:46] <PapuaHardyNet> I guess one way to deal with this may be to literally create notations for things that don't already have notations in the language.
[16:04:31] <PapuaHardyNet> for math, you don't have to worry about compilation, but for code, you'll probably need to ensure that the symbols you use correspond to whatever operations or variables or whatever you intend them to do
[16:04:57] <PapuaHardyNet> I am curious - why have you gone a month without touching any code?
[16:05:43] <gurkenglas> Because I was looking at what category theory has to say about what definitions behave like entropy
[16:07:05] <gurkenglas> (havent finished that, but it's time to produce some results so LTFF isnt left with nothing)
[16:09:11] <PapuaHardyNet> huh. I didn't realize you had to show results to LTFF. well, good luck with that

[20:26:08] <adiabatic> if you expect to be working, you want the quiet
