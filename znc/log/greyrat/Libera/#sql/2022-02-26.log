[22:50:11] <Xgc> non_AI: You just did.  It just wasn't an interesting question.
[22:51:05] <non_AI> I have a table with three columns:  Key number (primary key) | Access group | Doors
[22:52:11] <non_AI> What would be a proper way to normalize this data, considering each key has one to many relationship with access group and one to many with doors
[22:52:17] <Xgc> non_AI: Back up and explain the purpose and requirement of the table.  Define doors.  Define an access group.
[22:53:10] <Xgc> non_AI: Show the supporting tables.  You probably have an access group table and maybe a doors table.
[22:53:21] <non_AI> just a sec
[22:53:59] <Xgc> It's tough to normalize without complete definitions and a clear goal.
[22:55:58] <non_AI> https://pasteboard.co/TDhAWgHEmy4s.png
[22:56:07] <non_AI> first table is how i got data
[22:56:13] <non_AI> but i stuck at second table
[22:56:45] <Xgc> non_AI: That's more helpful, but still lacks context and definitions of terms.
[22:57:25] <non_AI> I think I should create two more tables
[22:58:06] <Xgc> non_AI: I can't help without your goal.  Only you know what you're trying to model.
[22:58:10] <non_AI> table one: Key | Access group and second one: Acccess group | Doors
[22:59:04] <non_AI> This way I would like to avoid redundancy
[22:59:20] <Xgc> Right. That was my guess.  You have a concept of doors and access groups.  Each probably needs a table.  I can't tell if your concept of a door is just a link to some other object or not.
[22:59:45] <Xgc> I don't know what your door represents.
[22:59:56] <Xgc> Nor an access group.
[23:00:12] <non_AI> Isn't this clear from tables?
[23:00:24] <non_AI> Doors are in access groups
[23:00:44] <non_AI> And each key has one access group
[23:00:50] *** Joins: maret (~maret@nat-88-212-37-89.antik.sk)
[23:01:23] <non_AI> But key nr.1 or nr. 3 can both have same access group
[23:01:35] <Xgc> non_AI: No.  It was not clear this was about accessing doors.  That would have been easy to state as part of the problem / goal.
[23:01:54] <non_AI> I am sorry for miss understanding
[23:02:52] <non_AI> But the big problem I am facing is how to design this database if doors would change in access group, meaning if for one access group, we would delete the doors out or add new
[23:03:12] <Xgc> non_AI: You should have a table of distinct access groups and a table of distinct doors.  Now the above table is just a many to many relationship linking the two sets of objects.
[23:03:51] <non_AI> So, bassically I would have to have three tables?
[23:03:58] <Xgc> non_AI: Table: access_door (access_group_id, door_id), for each separate pair.
[23:04:23] <Xgc> non_AI: That eliminates that comma separated list you had, which was a problem.
[23:05:42] <Xgc> Just insert a row to add one door to one access_group.  To remove a door from that access_group, just delete that row.
[23:06:31] <non_AI> So I would need table: Keys(Key|Access group), Access(id,access group), Doors(id, doors) and junction table between Access and Doors?
[23:07:43] <Xgc> non_AI: You're adding a concept of a key.  Yes.  You could have a key per access_group... or you could allow keys to be configurable.
[23:08:19] <non_AI> But key is very important
[23:08:26] <Xgc> non_AI: No need to hold 15 keys on your chain if you can just add associations to any key dynamically.
[23:09:59] *** Joins: voices- (~voices_@84.238.197.28)
[23:11:11] <Xgc> Think of each person as holding one personal access key.  That key can be configured to allow/remove access to any groups dynamically.
[23:11:49] <Xgc> A person leave an company, you can just delete (or disable) that personal key in the system without touching any other access lists.
[23:12:43] <non_AI> https://pasteboard.co/ehsWXD6o7dnY.png
[23:12:55] <non_AI> Is this what you were thinking?
[23:12:58] <Xgc> That avoids the need to distribute common keys, which opens up lots of problems.
[23:14:29] <Xgc> non_AI: That's the first level of the design, just to define some groups, doors and initial associations.
[23:15:31] <Xgc> The personal access groups can be added with a hierarchical structure in your groups table.
[23:16:41] <non_AI> O.K. i will read about this
[23:16:49] <non_AI> thank you very much
[23:16:54] <Xgc> No problem.
[23:17:10] <Xgc> Lots of ways to do it, as with most problems.
