[07:47:59] <pj> oh, I see you were answering a question from someone else.
[07:49:32] <pj> what's interesting is this...
[07:49:36] <pj> # var=something; read -t .1 var; declare -p var
[07:49:37] <shbot> pj: declare -- var=""
[07:49:42] <pj> # var=something; read -t 0 var; declare -p var
[07:49:43] <shbot> pj: declare -- var="something"
[07:49:56] <pj> it bahaves differently with .1 vs 0
[07:50:51] <pj> at the end of the day, if read returns failure then I would not rely on the contents of the variables one way or another.
[07:51:09] <roo-> -t 0 is a special case, so maybe that's acceptable
[07:51:34] <pj> # var=something; read -t .1 var; echo $?: declare -p var
[07:51:37] <shbot> pj: 142: declare -p var
[07:51:42] <pj> # var=something; read -t 0 var; echo $?: declare -p var
[07:51:43] <shbot> pj: 1: declare -p var
[07:51:51] <pj> different failure codes as well
[07:52:29] <pj> 142 is a SIGALRM

[07:52:58] <pj> so from what I can gather the implementation of 0 is different from .1 entirely, hence the reason why it fails differently.

[07:58:18] <roo-> pj: The problem is, that if you consider all 'failures' to be the same, that essentially you're saying that you don't trust read -t 1 to perform partial reads

[07:58:49] <pj> I would appear that internally if you set a timeout > 0 then read clears the variable and waits on input, setting an alarm for the timeout seconds, hence why it's clear with .1, but if the timeout is 0 read simply checks to see if there's input already and if there is not then it immediately exits with a value of 1.
[07:59:25] <pj> hrmmmmm, true, it will return the partial content.  So what of read -t 0 with a partial read, then?

[14:47:33] <greybot> OK, geirha
[14:47:35] <cousteau> (the ... is a shell command, so it's not c) 
[14:51:32] <cousteau> I was thinking csh, bash or maybe one of those fancy things you can do in zsh.  csh definitely doesn't support it in any form, but replacing ( ) with (( )) it works in zsh and (unofficially) in bash.

[18:46:03] <lmat> earnestly: The relevance of atomic is that these several processes are running in the background. They will   successes+=("$output");  "asynchronously" and I want to make sure they don't corrupt the array or ...whatever else might go wrong.
[18:46:05] <cousteau> geirha: sorry, was afk.  In fact, the parentheses were single on both sides, like ``for (i=0; i<n; i++) ...``
[18:46:27] <earnestly> lmat: It's tied to the index, so there is no resource contention over which index goes where
[18:47:06] <geirha> cousteau: ah, well then it's definitely not valid bash syntax at least
[18:47:13] <earnestly> lmat: It doesn't matter if each command is done in the background, cmd at index 4 will assign its output in the arrays success or failure at index 4, nothing else will
[18:47:24] <cousteau> When you say this for syntax is bad practice, did you mean specifically the use of { }, or the use of for (( )) in general? 
[18:48:59] <earnestly> lmat: And so there is no reason for atomic (locking) operations because there is no contention.  The slots are predetermined according to the cmd array indicies
[18:49:46] <earnestly> (At least there is no contention over the index, how bash grows and manages arrays its its own affair)
[18:50:07] <lmat> earnestly: Okay. I'm considering not doing what you suggested (success[i]="$out"), but instead choosing dense arrays (success+=("$out") ). Is there contention at that point?

[19:04:34] <cousteau> geirha: I was actually thinking what the scope of that `local` would be, and if it would still exist within the if body 
[19:04:38] <geirha> local is more interested in whether the assignment of the variable went ok. E..g if o was marked readonly in an outer scope, it will return non-zero

[20:34:09] <greybot> basename(1) can strip the directory and extension from a path (dir/subdir/file.ext -> file.ext or file). A parameter expansion can do it cleaner and *much* faster: "${path##*/}", "${path%.*}", at the cost of missing edge cases like path=/ or path=/path/to/dir/

[22:42:36] <FreeBDSM> hi. I have a variable with a string in it. I'd like to reduce it to last 4 chars.
[22:43:03] <thebombzen> noclobber only affects `>` redirects and the like
[22:43:13] <FreeBDSM> woah, a space!

[22:43:58] <shbot> FreeBDSM: test
[22:44:27] <thebombzen> omegatron: if you're calling another program it might have a no-clobber setting. if not you have to check for the file you're setting. bash doesn't sandbox anything it calls, so options like noclobber only affects bash's behavior, not the behavior of things it calls
[22:44:48] <omegatron> don't explain it to me
[22:44:53] <thebombzen> to actually do that kind of thing requires a heavyweight sandbox, which is both very difficult and can be easy to break intentionally
[22:45:11] <thebombzen> if you're trying to implement a sandbox then bash is the wrong tool
[22:45:41] <omegatron> don't explain it to me - wrong recipient !
[22:45:50] <thebombzen> ah, I see what you meant
[22:46:03] <thebombzen> Helmholtz1: see my message above
[22:46:21] <thebombzen> if you know the names or the locations of specific files you want to protect then you can use `chmod` or other similar permission manipulation
[22:46:42] <thebombzen> but otherwise, you can't
[22:46:48] <omegatron> that's why I ended my suggestion with ", but ..."   - it's not a good approach
[22:47:38] <themachine> it seems to me like it's just lazy code and he's looking for something to just catch all overwriting
[22:47:45] <themachine> which apparently doesn't exist so he just needs to write proper tests
[22:48:12] <Helmholtz1> omegatron, It's my script but I want protection against a random user's misuse 
[22:48:21] <thebombzen> then don't let random users execute the script
[22:48:28] <thebombzen> make it so the script only has +x for you
[22:48:32] <thebombzen> or can't read it
[22:48:42] <thebombzen> etc.
[22:48:52] <thebombzen> why is a random user reading a script on your system anyway
[22:49:14] <themachine> why does your script allow random users to modify files they apparently shouldn't be allowed to modify?
[22:49:33] <thebombzen> if the user doesn't have write permission to the file anyway your script should not change that
[22:49:56] <omegatron> I guess he is talking about "a random user's input" , which might wreak havoc - in this case, proper input data checks are to be done
[22:50:22] <omegatron> but without further detailed information ..
[22:50:44] <thebombzen> well, for example, if /bin/ and /bin/bash are owned by root and you have no write access then you have no way of removing /bin/bash
[22:50:46] <Helmholtz1> thebombzen, thanks iddn't know
[22:50:47] <thebombzen> or editing it
[22:51:33] <thebombzen> if you want to protect against maliciously supplied data then you're much better off sanitizing the input than you are trying to handle the problem of unsanitized input
[22:52:04] <thebombzen> for example, remove any occurenced of `/` or nonprintable characters or something of that form
[22:52:45] <thebombzen> it's much simpler, much easier, ans much safer to make it so by the time the data gets to your utility it is safe than it is to try to protect your utility from wrecking havoc

[23:02:50] <greycat> First of all, this should not be a bash script.  It should be written in some other language that's more appropriate.  Second, it should not take a COMMAND name as partial input.  Only the pattern.
[23:03:17] <dfg> Helmholtz1: i built something similar a while ago https://asciinema.org/a/3LK2IMG74GaoECkk30Otq5UiW
[23:03:25] <earnestly> And regardless, what is there to even preview with most of them?
[23:03:34] <earnestly> chmod?  chown?  ln?
[23:03:41] <Helmholtz1> earnestly, nothing I just wanted protection
[23:03:49] <djph> from what?
[23:04:03] <Helmholtz1> from any disk write acess
[23:04:07] <themachine> djph:  from a user providing rm as input for his script and accidentally nuking their $HOME
[23:04:16] <earnestly> Helmholtz1: What if a legitimate preview needs that?
[23:04:24] <themachine> Helmholtz1: Where in this script does the users input come into play
[23:04:29] <dfg> Helmholtz1: fzf isnt going to help you with security
[23:04:32] <omegatron> why not running the whole thing in a throw-away virtual machine?
[23:04:34] <themachine> I'm not clear on what is user input based on the one-liner you provided
[23:04:35] <Helmholtz1> themachine, that fzf part
[23:04:39] <Helmholtz1> sorry that jq part
[23:04:40] <djph> oh, that's easy --> chalk the script up as bad, and re-evaluate what you're trying to do.

[23:05:34] <themachine> Helmholtz1: so "jq {q} file.json" is the entirety of what a user is potentially inputting?
[23:05:42] <themachine> or are they just inputting file.json?
[23:05:44] <greycat> My guess is what they WANT is a Tk application with a text entry field and bindings that trigger an action on every keyrelease event in the entry field.  Every time ia keyrelease occurs, take the contents of the field (work in progress) and use that as a pattern to match shit.
[23:05:54] <greycat> As I said, different language.
[23:06:17] <Helmholtz1> themachine, no....echo '' | fzf --print-query --preview "$user_input_command {q} file"
[23:06:30] <greycat> that makes no sense.

[23:07:20] <djph> greycat: ew, I hate it when an input tries predicting what I want ... like whatever citrix does
[23:07:23] <Helmholtz1> https://github.com/akavel/up
[23:07:29] <djph> god that is so annoying
[23:07:29] <Helmholtz1> there is a go app doing this
[23:07:35] <Helmholtz1> and also suffers from this rm issue
[23:07:37] <greycat> djph: well, that sounded like what they wanted.
[23:07:53] <djph> greycat: oh, it certainly does.  It's also annoying as hell
[23:08:07] <djph> ... don't do a 15 second search on every. fucking. keypress.
[23:08:58] <themachine> Helmholtz1: well it doesn't look like that go program runs EVERY SECOND
[23:09:14] <themachine> looks like it runs when the user manually submits their input
[23:09:22] <Helmholtz1> dfg, so its you, hello :D I have bookmarked your script previusly https://github.com/DanielFGray/fzf-scripts/blob/master/fzrepl

[23:10:06] <dfg> ah ok cool
[23:10:24] <dfg> Helmholtz1: so what are you after that isnt covered by either fzrepl or up
[23:10:43] <themachine> Helmholtz1: well I'm just looking at the GIF on the README
[23:10:46] <themachine> I didn't look at the code
[23:10:50] <earnestly> heh, less can do what up does (although with more difficulty) and obviously without generating scripts
[23:11:06] <themachine> If it is executing again after every keypress then it is validating user input first
[23:11:15] <Helmholtz1> dfg, does your script prevent the issue I'm talking about?
[23:11:19] <themachine> which is what your script should be doing if you want to prevent users from running certain things
[23:11:30] <dfg> Helmholtz1: im not sure i understand your issue?
[23:11:44] <earnestly> dfg: escaping and executing shell commands
