[08:14:44] <ofm> from dockers website, not apt install, you say?
[08:15:06] <Disconsented> Their docs use apt
[08:15:14] <Disconsented> You use their version rather than your distro's

The atopacct service had crashed some time back. When I tried to restart the service, it failed, but the pacct_source file was rotated/truncated to 0. However, the space continues to be full in df output, and I continue to get journal errors. What can I do here?

[15:54:36] <Khepra> lembron: is the shell different? also, pasting multiple lines isn't really adviseable, QED. script it, curl/wget the script and exec it in one line if you REALLY have to.  curl | sh  ;   ONLY if you trust the source and the network it comes over.

[16:03:29] <eyeoh> oh hi arahael
[16:03:33] <eyeoh> I do have steam working on debian, yes
[16:03:50] <eyeoh> I even have it working in i3wm
[16:04:11] <eyeoh> specificially, I run debian stable with the nvidia binaries that are in the non-free repo
[16:04:31] <arahael> eyeoh: Oh, that's good to know.
[16:04:46] <arahael> I'm considering rebuilding my system, from nixos back to debian.
[16:05:11] <eyeoh> I like not having to chase a biannual upgrade schedule, so that's why I use debian stable
[16:05:31] <arahael> Yeah, or at the very least debian testing.  That eventually becomes stable.
[16:06:02] <eyeoh> yeah although if stable works, I like the "if it ain't broke" idea

[16:07:26] <arahael> *trivial.
[16:07:38] <eyeoh> even a microSD card in a USB microSD reader might work
[16:07:49] <eyeoh> (microSD = faster/cheaper than most USB 3 sticks)
[16:08:08] <eyeoh> I like the readers that look like USB sticks themselves
[16:08:11] <arahael> Yeah, well, I could get a 1TB SSD.
[16:08:26] <arahael> Cheaper than christmas. :(
[16:08:56] <eyeoh> steam is quite well supported now https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=steam
[16:09:11] <eyeoh> the main question is video drivers I guess
[16:09:18] <arahael> And the specific game.
[16:09:32] <arahael> I've currently only got the on-CPU graphics.
[16:09:49] <arahael> Those tend to work very well in linux, at least - GPU prices today are insane.
[16:09:50] <eyeoh> yeah that'll be a case of just trying it
[16:09:57] <eyeoh> and comparing to see if ubuntu etc does any better
[16:10:23] <arahael> Yeah, that was the other option, but I prefer the stability of Debian.
[16:10:26] <eyeoh> at least that'd be my approach
[16:10:49] <arahael> All the cool kids seem to be using Ubuntu, though. :(
[16:11:55] <eyeoh> it's probably easier to deal with in some ways, but only some :)
[16:12:20] <eyeoh> I think Debian Stable is close enough for most practical purposes
[16:12:36] <arahael> I think I might go with that. :D

[17:33:10] <sharperguy> I was imagining something like, in my project workspace I have a file similar to a Makefile or Docker file that specifies several process that run in the background and you would start/stop/restart them all simultaneously with a single command and then have the option to view their output in a screen-like session.

[17:36:06] <Khepra> packages won't overwrite /etc/ configs without asking for user confirmation, and even that won't happen unless there's a change in config file format which if it happens, happens on major release upgrades, maybe but very rarely on point releases
[17:36:21] <Khepra> if a package does, it has a grave bug, and I'm not aware such a bug exists for auditd

[20:18:15] <maxzor> I am on debian testing and a find_package(LLD REQUIRED CONFIG) fails, although I have installed liblld-13 liblld-13-dev lld-13. Setting manually LLD_DIR to the place where LLDConfig.cmake is (LLD_DIR=/usr/lib/llvm-13/lib/cmake/lld/) does not help... any clue?
