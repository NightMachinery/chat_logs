[00:10:42] <hassoon> don't use many elements, one sole element with the right animation and linear gradient coloration is enough
[00:11:50] <teut> https://jsfiddle.net/5drpg6au/6/
[00:11:59] <teut> can you just inline these?
[00:12:08] <hassoon> teut: nope, i just gave you another approach
[00:12:13] <teut> wow
[00:12:14] <hassoon> teut: here https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/418
[00:12:17] <teut> thats amazing
[00:12:27] <teut> and its smooth
[00:12:45] <hassoon> yep
[00:13:37] <teut> didnt know about repeating linear gradient
[00:14:17] <hassoon> good, now that you know about it, read about its nice capabilities and features
[00:14:19] <teut> does that creates a zebra  stripe?
[00:14:27] <hassoon> sure, it creates whatever you want
[00:14:31] <hassoon> !mdn gradient
[00:14:35] <hassoon> meh whatever
[00:14:42] <teut> ya, I d=looked the docs
[00:14:43] <hassoon> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/repeating-linear-gradient()
[00:14:53] <teut> yes I already read it
[00:16:24] <teut> I dont understand the logic yet
[00:16:46] <teut> you made that stripe with linear gradient which now contains 3 black boxes
[00:19:42] <teut> whats the 30 , 40 magic numbers?
[00:20:12] <teut> is there some math/calculations involved?
[00:23:59] <teut> whatever it may be I will think about it, thanks for the help again
