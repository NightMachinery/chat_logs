[00:07:53] <synolect> How can I get lounge to wait to /ns id before trying to join a +r channel?
[00:08:10] <synolect> Do I have to set /join as a command after registering, since I assume those will be run in order?
[00:09:09] <bookworm> synolect: on this network?
[00:09:53] <bookworm> because if you are talking about libera (or any other sane network) you should be using sasl instead to avoid all the races, rather than sleeping
[00:10:07] <synolect> It is a libera channel. #musicbrainz
[00:10:27] <synolect> and I figured I was going about this the wrong way, but I wasn't sure of the right way
[00:10:37] <synolect> (right now I just manually /rejoin)
[00:10:45] <xnaas> Then you should be authenticating using SASL so you're logged in before other things happen, like joining channels.
[00:11:38] <xnaas> right-click and edit your libera connection and look at the Authentication section // use SASL PLAIN, the password is your NickServ password

[00:21:26] <synolect> Another question: I put lounge behind traefik with basic auth, and later intend to put it behind forward auth. Lounge isn't playing super nice with basic authentication; the PWA complains whenever my session expires and doesn't handle the 401s well. Is this likely to be the case for forward auth? I'd prefer to not have my lounge instance be
[00:21:26] <synolect> publicly accessible, but I'll do it if it plays nicer with the mobile and desktop web apps.

[01:39:19] <c014> Seems to work
[01:39:30] <c014> Since it reloads text on restart
[01:40:09] <Activ8> if you can search then it's searching the sqlite3 database I think
[01:40:33] <Activ8> do a /search activ8 do I appear in your search results?
[01:40:52] <c014> Yes you do :)
[01:41:23] <Activ8> then search works and that's a sqlite function
[01:42:03] <synolect> With the forward auth stuff, it's basically what xnaas was saying, similar to Authelia. Alternately you can have it just kick you to a google/github/openidwhatever signin page, but I'm not sure if that would make the webapp angry like the basic authentication does
[01:42:37] <c014> Then I can say, great success to bookworm

[02:06:22] <johncs> I'll make a patch today. I'll also take a look why that hasn't been causing problems.
[02:06:45] <johncs> Maybe there's a window.event that's bound to the currently dispatched event or something
[02:07:14] <johncs> ahaha yes exactly that in fact: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/event
[02:07:55] <bookworm> globals, ruining sane code since forever
[02:07:57] <johncs> gotta love old languages with forever-back-compat
[02:08:21] <bookworm> you forgot insane scoping rules :P
[02:09:13] <johncs> haha for sure. hoisting is real weird.
[02:10:01] <johncs> would be nice to hook up eslint to the codebase... static analysis could catch this sort of bug, so might as well let it
[02:10:48] <bookworm> we have it actually
[02:11:24] <bookworm> throws a deprecation warning as well ;)
[02:11:35] <johncs> hm... why'd that get past it then i wonder
[02:12:08] <bookworm> well it's a warning, not an error
[02:12:22] <bookworm> "hint" actually
[02:12:24] <johncs> oh aslant gives a warning, i see
[02:12:31] <johncs> *eslint 
[02:13:08] <johncs> i generally don't allow any warnings from a linter to pass
[02:13:14] <johncs> (as in: test suite fails)
[02:13:26] <johncs> i wonder if that would be practical to enable
[02:13:27] <bookworm> good luck, "this can be converted to a ES6 module"
[02:13:42] <bookworm> at the very least we'd need to inhibit that one
[02:13:49] <johncs> it's not too bad generally... you just disable the rules you don't like and add inline disables for rules you want to ignore specifically
[02:14:02] <bookworm> Oh don't get me wrong I like linters
[02:14:14] <bookworm> in fact, I like *compilers* that check types
[02:14:30] <johncs> could use typescript, pretty easy initial transition generally
[02:17:45] <johncs> might end up being a bit of a barrier to contribution though... less people know typescript than know JS

[12:49:13] <c014> Is there plans on making the logs easily browsable, same with file uploads (so I can delete old uploads).. and user management through the gui?
[12:50:45] <fnutt> There are 0 plans.
[12:51:00] <c014> :(
[12:51:04] <fnutt> It's all based on what people contribute to the project.
[12:51:12] <fnutt> code-wise
[12:51:19] <fnutt> and people do this on their part time.
[12:51:33] <fnutt> Ergo, 0 plans.
[12:51:38] <c014> Sometimes there can be a roadmap
[12:51:48] <fnutt> There's not in this project.
[12:52:02] <c014> Alright
[12:52:39] <fnutt> https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/issues/1423 is somewhat related to your question.
[12:52:56] <fnutt> But it's only about logs.
[12:53:12] <fnutt> Anyway, if you want something implemented, please feel free to make a PR. :D
[12:54:40] <c014> I thought the download of logs was a good idea
[12:54:53] <c014> Yeah.. I might

[13:12:50] <fnutt> For me it could be as simple as serving the .txt file for the channel as a whole.
[13:13:04] <fnutt> Then I could just browse/search through that .txt file.
[13:13:45] <c014> I prefer logs for each day
[13:14:01] <fnutt> Far more complicated to implement though.
[13:15:32] <c014> mm.. a log browser in the gui would be best.. but I understand that needs some amount of work

[13:39:05] <bookworm> as for "log browsing" I guess ux wise we'd integrate that in the search, adding context and such. As simply "browsing" already works today by scrolling upwards :P
[13:44:16] <fnutt> It's not simple and user friendly.

[13:46:42] <c014> Would be if you could right click on the channel, press show logs, and a search window came up listing all the log files for each day, and if you click on one it just shows the log, still with the search function at the bottom
[13:50:24] <c014> But then it would need to save log files for everyday, like #thelounge > 2021-12-20.log

[14:28:44] <fnutt> I'm a little bit against that approach.
[14:29:18] <fnutt> If you want to store logs in sqlitedb for a fair amount of time, it will generate a large file size and over time slow down the client.

[14:37:34] <bookworm> pretty sure we can optimize the one or other bottleneck
[14:38:27] <bookworm> and using a proper db means you can actually query things based on time, context, user, etc
[14:39:31] <c014> Sounds good to me

[17:30:29] <shadoozo> I've thought of implementing the upload viewer/delete old uploads. But there's currently no way of knowing who uploaded the file, so you *could* make something that lists (and allows removal of) *all* uploads, but that seems pretty undesirable on an instance with multiple users.
