[04:44:35] <rdrg109> TIL: Executing widen (C-x n w) in the root of an Info manual will display the entire info manual. This implies that we can use occur, helm-occur, swiper for searching in a whole info manual. If we don't execute widen, then occur, helm-occur and swiper search in the current info node, isearch-forward is able to jump between nodes but some people don't use that function.

[06:17:26] <noyb> When installing emacs-nox on freebsd, it wanted to remove the elm pkg.  What would cause them to be mutually exclusive?  That seems strange to me.
[06:17:38] <dale> grym: I think you are not contradicting my reading of the paper, but rather pointing out that 11.3x fewer antibodies is not a big deal because the vaccine produces so many to begin with?
[06:17:48] <grym> dale: yep
[06:18:15] <grym> dale: i'll absolutely believe that reduction in antibody titer, but i think it doesn't have anything close to a linear effect on efficacy
[06:18:20] <dale> noyb: First guess is that the Emacs package comes with some kind of mail-related script/program to help Emacs read mail, and Elm also comes with it, and they conflict.

[06:26:00] <dale> If I'm reading that second paper right, then the effective level for "50% protective neutralization" against COVID-19 was 20% of the level of the mean convalescent level.  If I'm reading figure 1a right there, I think it's saying that Pfizer (BNT162b2) produced ~2x the neutralization level compared to convalescent individuals.
[06:27:14] <noyb> I was thinking of trying emacs after 30 years.  The last time I used it every day was in 1990 when I had to compile it on SunOS.  When I installed emacs-nox, it removed the 'elm' pkg (with my permission...) because I didn't think emacs would stay long.  ;-)
[06:27:15] <dale> So if convalescent individuals had 5x the antibodies for 50% protection, and Pfizer produces 2x the antibodies compared to just catching the virus and recovering from it, then the Pfizer vaccine will produce 10x the antibodies necessary for 50% protection?  In that light, it seems like 11.3x fewer antibodies from the Delta variant is at least potentially close to meaningful.
[06:27:39] <dale> noyb: You will note that I, too, knew what /usr/bin/elm was, so you're in good company. ;)
[06:28:17] <grym> dale: so far, looks like it knocks about 10% off protection from symptomatic disease and about 2% off rate of severe disease: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/05/24/2021.05.22.21257658.full.pdf

[06:30:03] <dale> I just wonder if we're close to the point where a variant that produces a slightly lower response than Delta will end up being a tipping point where vaccines won't be terribly effective.

[06:30:29] <grym> right now delta is very effectively outcompeting everything else, though

[09:59:23] <Viking667> I've since found that if I add a space at the beginning of the line, the syntax highlighting doesn't wig out.

[12:49:49] <bpalmer> xrogaan: safe-local-variable-values lets you specify exact values that are safe. The put form you were showing says that the exact value doesn't matter; any value that satisfies the function stringp is ok.

[12:51:26] <bpalmer> the latter is easy to express in a function, but you do have to write some code; the former is easy to handle via customize where you just list things that are ok.
[12:51:38] <xrogaan> I don't really understand, don't really care either. I just want the values in dir locals to not be ignored. So I'll write the put thing somewhere it'll be evaluated.

[12:52:47] <bpalmer> OK. Just be sure that you want to blindly accept all possible strings for that variable.
[12:53:36] <bpalmer> Let me give an actual example: when you run M-x shell RET , it will probably end up running what ever command is present in the variable shell-file-name. 
[12:53:57] <xrogaan> Yes. I need to be able to configure some behavior per project. For instance, here, to enable lsp's yapf and disable other stuff.
[12:54:34] <bpalmer> It's almost certianly ok to let shell-file-name be changed in a dir local to be /bin/bash , /bin/ksh/ , /bin/zsh and a few other "standard" values
[12:55:02] <bpalmer> but if you did let any random string be used, some prankster could wipe your system.
[12:55:32] <bpalmer> Of course, they'd still have to get it into your project directory, so it depends on how much you trust your (e.g., git collaborators)
[12:56:14] <dale> bpalmer: Well, they just have to get you to open it in Emacs, not just in your project directory, if you're modifying the idea of safe values for the variable globally, right?

[12:57:54] <dale> bpalmer: I thought it did but last time I looked I only saw it referring you to dir-locals.
[12:58:07] <dale> And I think I just looked last week.  If you know where in the docs those live, I'm interested to leran.
[12:58:14] <dale> Or learn, either way.

[15:44:11] <cumol> Ah, its context dependent
[15:44:34] <bpalmer> lisp123: \sX  represents a character in syntax category X; in particular, \s- (or \s followed by whitespace) stands for space.

[15:45:46] <bpalmer> lisp123: you're also not using enough backslashes in a string; "\s" is the same as "s"; to get the backslash to the regular expression engine, you need to write "\\s". (To verify: (length "\s") => 1)

[18:51:54] <lisp123> how to know if (beginning-of-line -X) has reached the first line of a buffer?
[18:53:23] <jcj> ,,df bobp
[18:53:23] <fsbot> bobp is a built-in function in ‘C source code’.
[18:53:24] <fsbot> (bobp)
[18:53:24] <fsbot> Return t if point is at the beginning of the buffer.
[18:53:24] <fsbot> If the buffer is narrowed, this means the beginning of the narrowed part.
[18:53:40] <lisp123> jcj: thanks!

[18:55:35] <jcj> if you need to know if it's anywhere in the first line, and not just at (point-min), you'll need to test whether `point-min <= point <= line-end-position with point at point-min'
[18:56:58] <jcj> but beginning-of-line moves point to point-min properly iirc, so bobp probably works

[20:41:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm willing to deal with having to open a secondary Emacs instance for the first use, if that allows me to avoid needing literal seconds to open individual emails.
[20:42:37] <wgreenhouse> yes; builds up header line overview and sticks it in RAM. even subsequent runs can be slow to start, as it checks the whole maildir collection for changes made by other programs
