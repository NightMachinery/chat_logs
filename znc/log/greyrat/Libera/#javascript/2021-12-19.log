[04:16:23] <OnkelTem> Could you recommend some alternatives to FFmpeg in wasm to merge MP3s in browser js?
[04:17:10] <OnkelTem> Think of a browser extension which gets a list of MP3 urls and merges them into one.
[04:17:32] <OnkelTem> Or, do you know a way how can an extension download multiple files? I think it's not possible

[05:09:15] <buu> "Pascal is actually one of the few languages that is quite readable, even for novices to programming. That's no coincidence, it was designed that way.
[05:09:29] <buu> I know this is just forum talk, but this level of thinking really makes no sense
[05:10:12] <ljharb> i have no idea what you’re talking about
[05:10:24] <buu> "Call the method foo on the object bar" "bar.foo()" "bar->foo" "foo bar", etc, are all differently "readable" but none of that matters because you don't know what foo or bar is!
[05:10:37] <ljharb> they were machine instructions in the beginning, making it seem like English is an inevitable improvement
[05:10:43] <buu> ljharb: I'm just ranting about trying to apply intuitive or readable to programming
[05:10:50] <ljharb> but you can.
[05:10:59] <sheetjs> there is a perverse disincentive
[05:11:00] <ljharb> and your Pascal quote is doing precisely that
[05:11:05] <buu> ljharb: Not in a meaningful way
[05:11:07] <sheetjs> if it's too readable, anyone can do it
[05:11:29] <ljharb> buu: many find it readable, including me. If you don’t, that says something about you and not readability, since meaning is solely subjective
[05:11:43] <buu> ljharb: Is there a difference between readable and understandable?
[05:12:19] <ljharb> there can be, because the words have slightly different connotations.
[05:12:37] <buu> ljharb: Would you say "foo.bar()" is readable?
[05:12:53] <ljharb> out of context, no, because most anything is unreadable out of context
[05:12:58] <buu> Yeah
[05:12:59] <sheetjs> foo.bar() as stated is readable but not understandable
[05:13:09] <buu> sheetjs: That's basically my point
[05:13:10] <ljharb> fair distinction
[05:13:24] <ljharb> but so? Readability matters in context
[05:13:41] <buu> So people talk about "Readability" as if using $ for variables or arrows for method or whatever mattered in the slightest
[05:13:47] <ljharb> it can.

[05:14:03] <ljharb> because “foo.bar()” isn’t a general principle for a given context
[05:14:03] <buu> I'm unconvinced
[05:14:11] <ljharb> but “use arrows for X” is
[05:14:17] <sheetjs> in foo.bar() what is foo or bar?
[05:14:19] <buu> ljharb: Yeah, that gets into "nothing is intuitive except the nipple" territory
[05:14:39] <ljharb> buu: that territory is the entireTy of where “readability/understandability” lives
[05:14:43] <buu> Is english more readable than russian? Who knows
[05:14:55] <ljharb> and yet, there are many studies measuring that sort of thing
[05:14:59] <buu> really?
[05:15:04] <sheetjs> with human language i think we look at the complexity of the grammar and the ambiguities
[05:15:08] <buu> I've literally never seen one!
[05:15:27] <ljharb> i doubt they’re reliable since it’s pretty hard to remove human bias with a human-designed experiment about humanity
[05:15:43] <ljharb> but I’m quite confident they exist. I’ll try to google one up later for you
[05:15:58] <buu> ". The obvious extremes would be perl or APL. In those, if you don't already know the symbol it's pretty much impossible to figure out. In smalltalk, it tends to read like english so you can usually understand what it's doing even if you're not entirely familiar with the syntax."
[05:16:20] <ljharb> there’s definitely linguistic comparisons of languages, measurements of ease of learning, expressibliity, etc
[05:16:21] <buu> (Because $foo = 42 is extremely complicated)
[05:16:29] <ljharb> and yes, Perl is supremely unreadable :-)
[05:16:52] <ljharb> obv it can be perfectly understandable once you learn it, but that’s not the same thing
[05:17:01] <buu> yeah but nothing is understandable if you haven't learned it
[05:17:33] <buu> ljharb: Something that people completely miss, frankly out of stupidity or sheer bias, either way, is the "understandability" of languages based on their standard library
[05:18:11] <buu> Perl actually scores very highly because of how many programs use syntax "built in" rather than defining their own

[05:18:25] <ljharb> i can understand some python code despite not knowing it. readability leads to understanding.
[05:18:30] <buu> C is basically the complete opposite because any mildly complicated C program has to define this massive internal specific syntax
[05:19:05] <buu> It's one of the major disadvantages of object based standard libraries
[05:19:14] <buu> javascript is one of the biggest examples of this
[05:19:59] <buu> This is essentially the idea of writing a DSL for every context =]

[07:45:00] <Maxdamantus> You could argue that C is one of the easiest to understand, because it's so restricted in what it's able to express.
[07:45:42] <Maxdamantus> It's much easier to understand what a CPU is going to do when reading a C program than when reading a Python or JavaScript program.
[07:46:20] <Maxdamantus> but such immediate understanding of a programming language isn't necessarily that useful.
[07:46:44] <theskillwithin> also Python and Javascript sounds cooler
[07:47:21] <Maxdamantus> what's more useful is being able to create inherently more complex programs while still being able to understand how they work, and that's usually largely based on being able to come up with appropriate abstractions, which C isn't very good at.

[13:12:27] <paulcarroty> I was a huge Matrix fan in my young&dumb stage 😎
[13:19:42] <stenno> the first matrix movie was awesome and groundbreaking
[13:19:58] <stenno> anything after that, not so much
[13:24:19] <Maxdamantus> The best film is obvously the second one.
[13:24:22] <Maxdamantus> (The Animatrix)
[13:25:30] <Maxdamantus> I'd say that's overall my favourite sci-fi film, though I'm generally not that much into sci-fi.
[13:26:12] <LordofLife_> Right on
[13:28:20] <stenno> oh wow animatrix is actually also by the wachowskis, i wasn't aware of that
[13:28:27] <stenno> i thought it was more of a tribute anthology
[13:28:56] <Maxdamantus> I don't think it's said to have been directed by them, just written.
[13:29:11] <stenno> written and produced
[13:29:13] <Maxdamantus> Each segment is directed by a different director.

[13:31:46] <Maxdamantus> Definitely not.
[13:32:24] <stenno> also if you like animatrix, you should check out the first season of 'love death + robots'
[13:32:30] <Maxdamantus> It gives more of an explanation of the matrix universe than any of the films.
[13:32:50] <Maxdamantus> of the other films*

[17:35:42] <austincheney> https://www.neuralegion.com/blog/websocket-security-top-vulnerabilities/#sniffing-attacks
[17:35:57] <austincheney> some of those attacks are actually preferences in a decentralized model
[17:36:36] <austincheney> and some others are solved using a security model that benefits a decentralized model at cost to the traditional client/server model
[17:39:02] <AlbertLast> i didn't look to deep into this, for me http 2 > websocket when needed feature matches
[17:42:05] <austincheney> regardless of speed the primary benefit of http is that it is sessionless where sockets require session establishment
[17:42:05] <AlbertLast> websocket is from 2011 and http 2 from 2015
[17:42:33] <austincheney> websockets don't have headers or roundtrip
[17:44:02] <AlbertLast> i know
[17:46:15] <austincheney> by changing from http to websockets my test automation in my personal application when from 45 seconds to 7 seconds.  Parallelization wasn't a factor as all assets were in place before testing started and all tests were serialized
[17:46:53] <AlbertLast> how long would take http 2?
[17:47:01] <austincheney> i don't know

[17:47:20] <austincheney> probably the same as http 1.1 because parallelization wasnt a factor
[17:48:48] <AlbertLast> i mean you could do also try http 3 maybne
[17:51:54] <austincheney> http 3 would be different.  I couldnt guess how it would perform in this scenario
[17:52:27] <austincheney> but this all assumes communication to the browser, most of my communications are to peers across the network
[17:53:19] <austincheney> i have not tried grpc yet, but I envison massive improvement from not having to stringify my instructions on each transmission

[22:40:23] <OnkelTem> I use OpenAPI to generate some typescript code for a project. And it generates code for browser, using types like 'FormData' or 'URLSearchParams'
[22:40:42] <OnkelTem> from lib.dom.iterable.d.ts probably
[22:40:54] <OnkelTem> I wonder can I get them (those types) in a node js app?

[22:58:28] <stenno> sure but thats not really what i want

[23:01:35] <obimod> you might be able to place a new eslintrc file in the web worker directory (for a more localized set of rules perhaps?) and then place 'self' in the "globals" conf?
[23:02:04] <obimod> not sure if eslint does that, allow for localized dir-based rc files
[23:02:17] <obimod> but i'd think it would be a useful feature
