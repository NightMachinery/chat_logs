[17:28:14] <michaelpj[m]> jneira: thinking of doing a hackage release of lsp libs, would like to check some things with you
[17:28:36] <michaelpj[m]> 1. will try and construct some changelogs
[17:29:01] <michaelpj[m]> 2. looks like we're not keeping them in exact version sync? Nonetheless, the others need bounds changes, so I guess do minor version bumps of `lsp` and `lsp-test`?
[17:32:08] <michaelpj[m]> 3. looks like we're missing a lsp-types-1.3.0.1 tag, I can try and guess the commit and make one, though
[17:38:19] <jneira[m]> nice, the project needs that kind of polishing
[17:38:42] <jneira[m]> for the changelog we could copy the GenChangelog.hs script from hls 
[17:38:59] <jneira[m]> i copied it recently to the vscode extension
[17:40:02] <jneira[m]> it only needs change the repo name inthe script
[17:40:52] <jneira[m]> <michaelpj[m]> "2. looks like we're not keeping..." <- not sure if we should keep lsp-test with the same version
[17:41:47] <jneira[m]> but lsp and lsp-types should be imo, as lsp reexports lot of tsp-types defs, a major bump of types will likely need amajor bump of the other
[17:56:23] <michaelpj[m]> Thanks, that's helpful
[17:56:44] <michaelpj[m]> I'll start a CONTRIBUTING.md while I'm at it

[22:38:54] <sooch> There should be a new fix, although that shouldnâ€™t have happened since merge...
[23:16:36] <fendor[m]> didn't update since merge
[23:17:28] <fendor[m]> huh, maybe not even the alternate literal plugin is responsible for that behaviour
[23:18:45] <fendor[m]> I have built HLS from source for some commit of the PR
[23:18:55] <fendor[m]> probably when debugging the tests
[23:21:43] <sooch> Yeah I only saw duplicates on a local branch, hopefully itâ€™s not in the merge ðŸ˜„
[23:30:56] <mpickering> I glanced at the code for that plugin today and it seems like the traversal could be more efficient by blacklisting some types to not traverse into, ie SrcSpan
