[04:00:25] <aaii> Hi guys, I have a question about LSTM and RNN, I have a data and the X input is an array of arrays and it Y is a number. How I can implement it? (The main problem for me is that how I can build a model, that the X is array of arrays of numbers like([[1,2,3], [123, 23 ,3] , ...]) and Y only is a number) thanks

[13:44:20] <stefan-_> aaii_, are you using pytorch?
[13:45:14] <aaii_> stefan-_, I'm using tensorflow and keras
[13:45:33] <aaii_> Hi guys, I have a question about LSTM and RNN, I have a data and the X input is an array of arrays and it Y is a number. How I can implement it? (The main problem for me is that how I can build a model, that the X is array of arrays of numbers like([[1,2,3], [123, 23 ,3] , ...]) and Y only is a number) thanks

[13:45:48] <SigmoidFroid> ⇒  debian Pastezone
[13:45:55] <aaii_> stefan-_, This is my question
[13:46:06] <aaii_> and the code
[13:47:08] <stefan-_> keras initializes the weights of the lstm to some sensible defaults
[13:48:38] <stefan-_> you could use multiple lstms, one for the inner arrays, and then one which works on an aggregates (e.g. last hidden state)
[13:52:24] <aaii_> stefan-_, Is it ok? https://paste.debian.net/1232624/
[13:52:26] <SigmoidFroid> ⇒  debian Pastezone
[13:52:46] <aaii_> but still the result is awful :( accuracy is 0 : |
[13:59:15] <stefan-_> it seems you are applying the first lstm on the flattened input sequences
[13:59:26] <aaii_> yes
[13:59:37] <stefan-_> my suggestion was to apply it multiple times on each inner sequence
[13:59:54] <stefan-_> collect an aggregate, and then apply a second lstm
[14:00:01] <stefan-_> not sure what the performance will be though
[14:00:16] <stefan-_> also I think this wont work with Sequential()
[14:00:39] <aaii_> you mean, I shouldn't flatten them?
[14:01:09] <stefan-_> yes
[14:10:23] <aaii_> stefan-_, So what's your suggestion for the data? becuase you said it's not ok with Sequential. But this data is timeseries data.
[14:27:10] <stefan-_> keeping the data as it is, flattening another, could be interesting to compare both approaches
[14:27:23] <stefan-_> +is one
