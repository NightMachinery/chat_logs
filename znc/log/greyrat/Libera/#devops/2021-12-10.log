[18:55:55] <bn_work> Is anyone aware of a container DSL that fully supports bash?  I'm finding DockerFile/Podman build process commands very limiting, ex:  want to be able to use parameter expansion- suffix pattern matching.  Are containerd, LXC, rkt, runC, etc. any better?  or are they all just as limited?

[22:04:57] <theseb> ??
[22:05:23] <lantech19446> read the pheonix project and the unicorn project so you understand it from both sides
[22:05:35] <Joel> theseb devops is supposed to be a mindset where by developers and operations establish tooling and processes to pull down walls
[22:06:49] <lantech19446> in an ideal world devops is built on top of the lean manufacturing concepts including but not limited too constant improvement and building around contingencies
[22:08:22] <Joel> rawtaz it's ##aws
[22:14:26] <kwilczynski> bn_work: If you want to run whatever you want during the Docker container build, and also don't want to deal with accumulating layers, then look at Packer's container builder.
[22:14:37] <kwilczynski> bn_work: It just works and allows you to do whatever you want.
[22:14:50] <kwilczynski> bn_work: There are also alternative projects from likes of Red Hat, etc.
[22:20:11] <rawtaz> Joel: ah ok

[22:20:34] <rawtaz> the # and ## is just bullshit IMO.

[23:17:46] <Latrina> hi rawtaz 
[23:17:50] <Latrina> good evening 
[23:19:18] <rawtaz> lo
[23:20:32] <Latrina> how's the weather there?
[23:21:19] <rawtaz> its probably shit, i havent looked out through the window today because thers no way anything can become any better spending the energy to do that.
[23:22:56] <slaughter> lmfao that's quite the philosophy
[23:23:08] <Latrina> I mean doesn't it snow over there during this time of the year?
[23:23:08] <rawtaz> D
[23:23:09] <rawtaz> :D
[23:23:24] <Latrina> I would love to see snow every day
[23:24:01] <rawtaz> its actually been snowing quite a lot here today, there's been a warm front (whatever that is called in english) coming in from the east, this makes the air move vertically and thereby creating precipitation.
[23:24:35] <Latrina> sweet
[23:25:07] <rawtaz> yeah :3
[23:25:14] <Latrina> it was gorgeous here today. Cold but really sunny. A quite rare threat 
[23:25:16] <rawtaz> unfortunately i havent had time to go outside at all while its light :(
[23:26:07] <Latrina> I will go to Norway in February, hopefully 
[23:26:28] <rawtaz> really? why, whats going on?
[23:26:52] <rawtaz> is there a shitshow over there that you're attending? :-)
[23:27:13] <rawtaz> must be deep in the trenshes of oslo
[23:27:19] <rawtaz> trench* perhaps
[23:30:42] <Latrina> what the heck does this mean ?

[23:32:21] <rawtaz> hehe cheers
[23:32:27] <Latrina> and yes, I know Latrina is Latrine in english
[23:32:39] <Latrina> thats exactly what my nicknmame means
[23:32:59] <rawtaz> but seriously, would you mind talking about your norway visit? im just curious :)
[23:35:11] <bn_work> kwilczynski: ok, thanks for the suggestions, I'll check those out.  I was reading about BuildKit's buildx.  Any thoughts about how it compares to that?
[23:35:14] <rawtaz> indeed thats a fishy warning message
[23:41:33] <bn_work> slaughter: that's not a bad idea, if it's not too complex I may do that as an interim solution
