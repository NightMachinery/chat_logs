[00:14:52] <[itchyjunk]> i wanna add 1 to the magnitude of y

[00:22:47] <nomagno> [itchyjunk]: Basically the _process() function runs as fast as it can on a separate thread, and the game is rendered at a steady 60FPS or whatever the framerate is, on a different thraed
[00:22:48] <[itchyjunk]> that seems a bit insane to me
[00:23:07] <[itchyjunk]> nomagno, so far so good
[00:23:19] <nomagno> So, when you run the _process() function, you're basically doing an atomic (+3, -3)
[00:23:43] <nomagno> because it is so fast and physics happen more often than frames, and it behaves as atomically as possible
[00:24:16] <GeDaMo> Pressing the jump key should trigger a jump 'action' which will progress each frame, changing position and frame of the character animation
[00:24:17] <nomagno> If you had alternating calls have different outcomes (every call does -3 OR +3, perhaps randomly), you could very seldom see something move

[01:19:21] <[itchyjunk]> yes so its based on subroutines
[01:19:24] <nomagno> A procedure or subroutine is a list of steps that has a single entry and exit point, effectively
[01:19:24] <pyzozord> because it is very much based on call stack

[01:44:03] <Athas> I read SICP in high school.  It totally changed my perspective on programming and programming languages, more than any other book I've read.
[01:44:33] <Athas> It started a year-long obsession with bootstrapping and defining concepts in term of fundamental primitives.  Great fun.
[01:44:38] <pyzozord> that's annoying :P
[01:44:45] <pyzozord> I'm 30 and I still heavn't read it
[01:45:36] <pyzozord> but I suspect I might have learned some of the concepts SICP has other ways over the years
[01:46:00] <EdFletcher> i'm certain that's true 
[01:46:27] <nomagno> It's using GTK, which is a widget toolkit. GTK abstracts over various rendering backends, and these rendering backends possibly hook to a GPU driver to accelerate their computations. The backends like Cocoa, Win32, Wayland, X11, connect to the OS mostly trough the standard library (statically linked/embedded, or dynamically linked/hooked), a facility it provides to code without needing to know assembly for each machine, AND to abstract over
[01:46:27] <nomagno> certain universal needs.
[01:46:36] <Athas> Probably.  SICP is written for people with no programming experience, after all.
[01:46:44] <pyzozord> I'm still convinced I can learn a lot from that book. It's high on my todo list, maybe be the first book I read after I finish with Basic Mathematics
[01:47:08] <Athas> But I think even an experienced programmer can be inspired by how far SICP gets with fairly simple code (it ends up defining a virtual machine and a compiler targeting that machine).
[01:47:15] <EdFletcher> i wasn't trying to say it's not a useful book - it really is - but like any book of that type, many of the concepts are self-discoverable with experience

[01:54:04] <pyzozord> CLRS and TAOCP are really dense and mathematical. The Algorithm Design Manual, is great for people who want to do algorithms but not necessairly prove them correct

[01:54:40] <pyzozord> nomagno: and just do leetcode
[01:54:44] <[itchyjunk]> + 3 produces a partial function
[01:54:48] <[itchyjunk]> but does it take a function ?
[01:55:09] <nitrix-mas> [itchyjunk], All Haskell functions are first-order.
[01:55:18] <[itchyjunk]> :O what!?
[01:55:32] <[itchyjunk]> what about map?
[01:57:12] <nitrix-mas> I think what you have in mind might be "first class" or "higher order". You almost never hear "first order" and it's fairly nuanced.

[01:57:53] <nitrix-mas> All functions are first class, not all of them are higher order.
[01:58:12] <nitrix-mas> Map is higher-order because it accepts another function as argument.
[01:58:14] <[itchyjunk]> when googling "higher order functions", the top google results seem to all call it higher order vs first order
[01:59:02] <Athas> nitrix-mas: is your argument that higher-order functions are a subset of the first-order functions?
[01:59:12] <nitrix-mas> In the case of (+), it's a partially applied function, in this case, an operator section.
[02:00:00] <[itchyjunk]> + is first order then?
[02:00:11] <[itchyjunk]> its not hiher order because it can't take function as argument?
[02:00:38] <[itchyjunk]> but since it does return a partial function..

[02:02:10] <Athas> [itchyjunk]: yes, (+) is a first order function (well it's an overloaded class method in Haskell, so you could actually define it to operate on functions I guess).
[02:02:31] <nitrix-mas> Higher-order is the specific property of a function whose type signature has an argument describes another function.
[02:02:40] <pyzozord> in lambda calculus everything is a function so I think everything is really a higher order function
[02:02:51] <pyzozord> because a 4 is a function that returns a 4 or something

[02:04:08] <Athas> [itchyjunk]: no.  A function is higher-order if it has "nested arrows" in its type.  This can be defined syntactically, but intuitively a function is only higher order if its *arguments* can be functions.  Returning a function is not enough (because any partially applied function does that).
[02:04:52] <[itchyjunk]> Athas, but the wiki definition says at least one condition must be met
[02:04:59] <[itchyjunk]> and returning a function is one of the condition
[02:05:42] <Athas> [itchyjunk]: alright, it depends on the language in question then.  Definitions are not universal.  In Haskell, few people would say that (+) is a higher-order function.

[02:06:06] <pyzozord> oh look I was right haha "In the untyped lambda calculus, all functions are higher-order"
[02:06:27] <[itchyjunk]> boo, i like strongly adhered to definitions
[02:07:16] <pyzozord> haskell is a typed lambda caculus so this applies
[02:07:19] <[itchyjunk]> need to understand (?) a bit more before i fully graps higher order functions
[02:07:19] <pyzozord> "in a typed lambda calculus, from which most functional programming languages are derived, higher-order functions that take one function as argument are values with types of the form (t1 -> t2) -> t3."
[02:07:40] <[itchyjunk]> haskell implements a typed lambda calculus?
[02:07:46] <[itchyjunk]> or it is typed lambda calculus?
[02:08:05] <Athas> Haskell is fundamentally modeled on the simply typed lambda calculus, but with (many) extensions.
[02:08:18] <nitrix-mas> pyzozord, Well, they aren't all higher-order, they're semantically treated as being higher-order, since there isn't a reliable method to differentiate them (like having type signatures).
[02:08:23] <[itchyjunk]> hmm in that example, it's taking a function as input (t1->t2)
[02:08:31] <[itchyjunk]> but it's not returning a function, though, right?
[02:08:32] <[itchyjunk]> t3
[02:08:38] <Athas> It might.  t3 can be anything.

[02:11:14] <pyzozord> so in untyped lambda calculus everything is a function and all you pass around are functions, so by necessity everything is a higher order function
[02:11:32] <nitrix-mas> Athas, Of course the types might mismatch and you may not be able to apply it. I'm trying to give an intuition.
[02:11:35] <pyzozord> but in typed lambda calculus everything still is a function, but we no longer call some things functions, we call them Int for example :P

[02:11:41] <Athas> Yes, true.  Although because everything is a higher order function, nobody uses that term when discussing the untyped lambda calculus.  It's no longer an interesting property.
[02:11:42] <macaw> "from which most functional programming languages are derived" => I have an issue with that, unless they are talking about functional-only/-centric languages. (like Haskell).
[02:12:18] <macaw> (Minor peeve though.)
[02:12:28] <Athas> macaw: which languages that brand themselves primarily as "functional" (not "multi-paradigm") are not based on the lambda calculus?
[02:12:30] <pyzozord> I bet this goes into type theory
[02:12:35] <Athas> I can think of... a few, which are borderline cases.
[02:12:40] <pyzozord> Or category theory. Or both

[02:13:56] <macaw> Athas: That's my argument - if they are talking about languages "that brand themselves primarily as \"functional\"", I agree with their assessment.
[02:14:17] <nomagno> Can you have a programming language that is both untyped and has no default memory word size?
[02:14:27] <macaw> But for ex. Scheme is very functional-capable and just doesn't "call" itself that.
[02:14:37] <nomagno> If you have to specify the word size instead of the type, is it untyped or differently typed?
[02:14:46] <Athas> nomagno: can you define "untyped"?
[02:14:51] <Athas> Like, fully untyped, not even dynamically typed?
[02:15:07] <nomagno> Athas: Well, untyped as in only has one type: memory
[02:15:14] <nomagno> or alternatively, everything is data and nothing has a type
[02:15:17] <nomagno> untyped, no type
[02:15:29] <pyzozord> at some point it boils down to hardware size of registers or data bus or something
[02:16:07] <pyzozord> can be untyped as in "all is size of that cpu likes the most"
[02:16:17] <Athas> Maybe something like Verilog, but I think this is at a boundary where our usual nomenclature becomes imprecise.

[02:17:12] <[itchyjunk]> <nitrix-mas> Yeah exactly. If you receive a function and you're able to invoke it / apply it, you become higher order.

[02:18:14] <nomagno> FPGAs*
[02:18:16] <pyzozord> I think I like the language that has only sizes that are 8, 16, 32 and 64 bit (assuming 64 bit cpu)
[02:18:34] <Athas> It can also be viewed as a programming language (although an uncomfortable one), and it lets you work very directly with bits.
[02:18:47] <pyzozord> but that's not enough, because certain assembly instructions treat bits as signed integeres, other as as unsigned, yet another ones as floating point...
[02:19:20] <pyzozord> so at the very least you have 8, 16, 32, 64 @ signed / unsigned @ int / float

[03:12:31] <jkk> In general, SSL/TLS does offer MITM protection. It encrypts data before it leaves your computer that only the endpoint can decrypt and vice versa. A MITM attack is ineffective against encrypted TLS connections because even if you intercept the public keys that the endpoints exchange, it still does not know their private keys.

[03:59:57] <Intelo> pyzozord correct. good point. so how to fully automate the first interview? I do want some.. coding in that. any other suggestions?  [itchyjunk] you are correct too. For the second interview, I would still say to have automates in place. e.g questions like? a) why did you chose this algo soltuion? b) what was time/space complexity and why? c) give
[03:59:58] <Intelo> at least 1 solution that was inferior to this? d) was there a better solution to this but you were unable to code it? <--- send voice note about all these?
[03:59:58] <Intelo> Even if I have to listen/see recordings, it will be kind of non-blocking async communication. I can also 2x speed while listening. It will save me a lot of time

[04:00:34] <[itchyjunk]> no clue.
[04:00:57] <[itchyjunk]> but if you want to automate your pipeline, you should write out your pipeline in detail first
[04:01:12] <[itchyjunk]> then figure out what the goal of those parts that you repeat are

[04:01:26] <Intelo> [itchyjunk] ok. I was thinking to make a simple web page or use google forms. Simple ask interviewee to record his screen and send recording to me. (voice, screen etc )

[04:01:36] <[itchyjunk]> if there are parts that you repeat and goals are something you can get it without putting in time yourself, automate that
[04:01:55] <[itchyjunk]> their own recording can be faked
[04:01:58] <flakland> it doesn't bother me if someone is "not nice", it bothers me if they  feign ignorance
[04:02:03] <[itchyjunk]> they can have someone else do it etc etc
[04:02:43] <Intelo>  I see
[04:02:48] * Intelo thinks
[04:02:57] <Intelo> How about record their video as well?

[04:04:42] <[itchyjunk]> Not sure, this is your pipeline.
[04:04:48] <[itchyjunk]> You do whatever makes your life easier.
[04:06:00] <Intelo> [itchyjunk] oh an important point I missed: The test will be sent via web page. They will have timer for each question to be displayed. Once the time for each question or overall test passes (since start time), the test cannot be retaken. So in that "one take" if the candidate had recorded the video. He can send. not otherwise. So I guess I will be
[04:06:00] <Intelo> getting this answer often "oh I screwed up my video, can I retake the test"?
[04:06:35] <[itchyjunk]> that sounds arbitrary
[04:06:58] <[itchyjunk]> when you find arbitrary solutions to a non well defined problems, you get people who can game the system and those who can't.
[04:07:03] <[itchyjunk]> this is common in video games.
[04:07:15] <[itchyjunk]> games will have some arbitrary restrictions that's in place without proepr thought
[04:07:24] <[itchyjunk]> and it inconvinences some player and lets others exploit it
[04:07:38] <[itchyjunk]> if you think video + times questions is a solution to your problem, that's fine
[04:07:59] <[itchyjunk]> but if you're randomly comming up with solutions without defining what problem you're trying to solve, idk what to say
[04:08:37] <Intelo> [itchyjunk] well just trying to do the simplest thing to achieve unattended interviews

[04:08:56] <[itchyjunk]> well, what the goal for unattained interview?
[04:09:04] <[itchyjunk]> what is the metric you're trying to measure?
[04:09:13] <[itchyjunk]> what will the scores of the test tell you?
[04:09:20] <[itchyjunk]> can you detect cheats?
[04:09:31] <[itchyjunk]> can you substitute the test for something else?
[04:09:34] <[itchyjunk]> is the test necessary?
[04:09:49] <Intelo> zoom won't do it as each person will see screen of other persons. I can't have multiple people come to same room at same time or make multiple rooms so they should do recording with obs studio on their own and upload to youtube or something
[04:10:08] <Intelo> score: each question will have marks and assesment done by humans

[06:00:46] <nomagno> SQLite isn't designed to scale all that much
[06:01:02] <CoJaBo> These get away with it because they're servers; only the main server process is directly hitting the DB
[06:01:26] <CoJaBo> In this usecase, there aren't really any notable *speed* bottlenecks
[06:01:47] <CoJaBo> Data integrity and probably storage efficiency is out the window tho.
[06:02:45] <CoJaBo> Honestly most of these are just 2 string cols and a JSON blob anyway, so PercolaMySQL wouldn't suck any less anyways

[06:24:44] <EdFletcher> Intelo, you've been around IRC long enough to know that cross-posting is poor etiquette, come on man. 
[06:24:57] <KillerWasp> amigojapan: i learn like wa in something side.
[06:25:17] <amigojapan> KillerWasp: you are just wrong
[06:25:21] <vdamewood> wa isn't a politeness marker, it's a topic marker.
[06:25:54] <KillerWasp> topic marker?
[06:25:57] <Intelo> EdFletcher I humbly disagree with that 'opinion'
[06:26:12] <amigojapan> KillerWasp: tho ha is read like wa
[06:26:39] <EdFletcher> Intelo: it is not an "opinion" 
[06:27:02] <Intelo> EdFletcher if its a rule in liberra, let me know citation
[06:27:13] <KillerWasp> 。。。
[06:27:16] <EdFletcher> lol fine, be a dick 
[06:27:28] <Intelo> :)
[06:27:50] <vdamewood> KillerWasp: In some languages, a distinction is made between topics and focuses. Topics are parts of a sentance that are old information or not the main part. focuses are the main part.
[06:28:03] <arahael> EdFletcher: Be a bit nicer, please.  Also it depends on /how/ you do that cross-posting
[06:28:23] <[itchyjunk]> Intelo, there are too many to list
[06:28:31] <EdFletcher> arahael: so spamming the exact same question to multiple topically distinct channels is OK? 
[06:28:31] <[itchyjunk]> youcanbookme is one of them
[06:28:34] <vdamewood> KillerWasp: So for example, I might say namae wa vdamewood desu. namae is marked wa, so it's a topic. It's not the important part of the sentance, vdamewood is. I'm inidcating that vdamewood is my name.
[06:29:04] <EdFletcher> (at nearly the exact same time as well, i should point out) 
[06:29:31] <amigojapan> KillerWasp: in Roman letters you can write wa for the topic maker but not in hiragana
[06:29:37] <Intelo> [itchyjunk] great
[06:29:42] <arahael> EdFletcher: If you're prepared to maintain the conversation in all of them, I'd say yes, but again, it depends on how you do it.  Spamming, then quitting after 5 minutes, on the other hand, is poor.

[06:30:20] <KillerWasp> well, i learn very bad then. Even for osaka?...

[12:55:10] <novns> django is ugly

[12:59:44] <simpleton> Yeah but I know how to use it well, and I can do great things with it and learning a new preprocessing system that I can't integrate complex libs and capabilities of python and things like ML or complex algorithms... I mean I am amazing at python and ML in python, and lots of tasks in python... Flask would be me starting over and would take time to learn how to use properly and to get to where I am with 
[12:59:44] <simpleton> django plus everything else python offers is either impossible or would take a very long time for a very basic purpose specific CMS and a design that doesn't look like someone made it with a WYSIWIG editor and can't do anything other than use WYSIWIG editors and they use all these ridiculously overpowered stuff to acoomplish tasks HTML/CSS/JS can accomplish, django will be for the CMS interface and the 
[12:59:45] <simpleton> content once I take it out of my static page and put it in a db that can be edited... using MySQL right now in planned implementation but can use any db Django can work with I think only SQL based... but those are all easy things to do for me compared to learning a huge frame work to make a basic site for a small organization that doesn't have any fancy stuff

[13:05:42] <novns> simpleton, you can use some easy CMS, like grav
[13:05:50] <novns> you just install and tune it
[13:06:10] <novns> and let people edit pages, it's easy there
[13:06:16] <simpleton> Yeah, but I think... that would be overkill and if a vuln gets published we will be attacked, we are already attacked every two or three days
[13:06:38] <simpleton> and they are running everything in Windows servers on Azure cloud which they used to make the page and it is constantly under attack

[13:10:16] <simpleton> I mean, I have a plan, and I will maybe adapt it as I go, but telling me how to do things does not generally change my mind unless you feel like writing a 20 page paper on why

[13:11:44] <simpleton> I don't know LISP, but I could do it
[13:12:31] <simpleton> I believe it is indeed, but it's also very secure, and I have cherrypy and mako with it to build non django components, and I got a C based chat server with a JS client already made...
[13:13:26] <simpleton> I am... not normal and don't care about the latest and greatest unless it adds something I can't do with what I already know. I mean if I was constantly changing with the times rapid development and deployment would be impossible for projects that start with new unleanred skills

[15:59:08] <mercenary> That is a time versus storage trade-off. You can define a grid of 'fixed points' at say 2*distance of interest, link each user to the nearest of the fixed points, and only consider users linked to the same point.

[23:47:22] <InPhase> Well they work at different layers of abstraction, so it's not really the same type of protocol.
[23:47:36] <pyzozord> Yep
[23:47:37] <InPhase> Like the physical layer has to do with how the voltages on the wires change and how that should be interpreted.
