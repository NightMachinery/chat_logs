[15:15:05] <dcpurton> Is this the sort of thing you have in mind? I take it there is nothing pre-existing like this for attachment menu?
[15:15:29] <flatcap> hi dcpurton 
[15:15:48] <flatcap> yes, that's the sort of thing
[15:16:03] <dcpurton> is it possible to colour the attahment list at all at present?
[15:16:09] <flatcap> no
[15:17:06] <dcpurton> üëç
[15:17:20] <flatcap> lovely, thanks :-)
[15:17:55] <flatcap> it's late down there.  are you read for some heavy news?
[15:18:13] *** Joins: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter)
[15:18:23] <flatcap> ready*
[15:18:30] <dcpurton> ...
[15:19:19] <flatcap> I've been digging into the AttachCtx/AttachPtr/Body mess
[15:19:44] <flatcap> trying to understand what's needed where
[15:20:24] <flatcap> I started by looking at Body->tagged, seeing if I could move it to AttachPtr->tagged
[15:20:43] <flatcap> the answer was 'nearly', but not quite
[15:21:20] <flatcap> when decoding, neomutt creates temp files and the FILE *fp is stored in the AttachPtr
[15:21:51] <flatcap> unfortunately, attachment_{save,print,pipe} need access to _that_
[15:22:08] <dcpurton> ah
[15:22:10] <flatcap> so their functions are polluted with AttachCtx/AttachPtr structs
[15:22:55] <flatcap> I created a complicated email example with two separately encrypted packages
[15:23:06] <flatcap> the diagrams are brain-melting :-)
[15:23:11] <flatcap> https://flatcap.org/mutt/multi-pgp/
[15:24:02] <flatcap> actx.svg and email.svg
[15:25:02] <flatcap> that shows the "normal" Bodys linked up
[15:25:41] <flatcap> the AttachCtx/Ptrs holding lots of FILE*
[15:25:57] <flatcap> and the AttachCtx holding the "spare" Bodys (the decrypted parts)
[15:26:24] <flatcap> (I'll try to write up all of this, later)
[15:26:31] <flatcap> anyway...
[15:27:39] <flatcap> for each "set" of Bodys that have one temp file, I think that the parent should own the FILE*
[15:27:54] <flatcap> (meaning we need Body->fp and Body->parent)
[15:29:16] <flatcap> Body->fp would mean we could eliminate Body->tagged and simplify attachment_{save,print,pipe}()
[15:29:59] <flatcap> don't worry, it's a lot to take in :-)
[15:30:20] <dcpurton> I fear you over estimate my knowledge of Neomutt src ;)
[15:31:01] <flatcap> everyone's perhaps, including my own :-)
[15:31:07] <dcpurton> I confess I didn't really worry *why* things where done like they were
[15:31:40] <dcpurton> All I knew was that I had to get the body links right and the attachment order and level in the list right
[15:31:45] <flatcap> the answer's: twenty years of poor design...
[15:32:07] <dcpurton> If I did those two things it displayed right and didn't crash
[15:32:14] <flatcap> hehe
[15:32:23] <dcpurton> If I got the linking wrong it crashed (or lost attachments)
[15:32:44] <dcpurton> If I got the attachment list wrong, they didn't display right
[15:32:56] <flatcap> :-)
[15:34:08] <flatcap> the code's been very resistant to refactoring
[15:36:20] <dcpurton> Is your goal to reduce Body/AttachCtx/AttachPtr to just one structure?
[15:36:26] <flatcap> that's it for now :-)
[15:36:51] <dcpurton> With Body as the primary one?
[15:37:30] <dcpurton> and just have the display constructed directly from that?
[15:38:15] <flatcap> no, I'd like to separate Data from View...
[15:39:01] <flatcap> Body should contain a little as possible (just Body data and pointers to link thinks up)
[15:39:34] <flatcap> (plus FILE*fp, I guess, for a temp file)
[15:40:14] <flatcap> I'd like to rename AttachPtr to BodyView (make it obvious what it is and what it does)
[15:40:38] <flatcap> that'd hold tagged, tree characters, index number, etc
[15:41:20] <flatcap> my original plan was to put *all* the links into AttachPtr/BodyView (next/prev,parent)
[15:41:38] <flatcap> but I'm not sure if that'll work
[15:42:46] <flatcap> A small Body means fewer deps.  That's the ultimate goal
[15:43:24] <dcpurton> What do you mean by fewer deps?
[15:43:54] <dcpurton> (what weird things is Body dependent on at the moment?)
[15:44:05] *** Quits: bremner (~bremner@notmuch/developer/bremner) (Remote host closed the connection)
[15:44:10] <flatcap> currently, `struct Body` includes `struct AttachPtr`
[15:44:19] <dcpurton> ah - like that
[15:44:53] *** Joins: Pali (~pali@user/pali)
[15:44:56] <flatcap> that header doesn't actually have any real dependencies, yet
[15:45:18] *** Joins: bremner (~bremner@notmuch/developer/bremner)
[15:45:27] <flatcap> but if the AttachPtr stored the colours, then suddenly Body would depend on the GUI libs too
[15:45:34] <dcpurton> But at some point you have to link the view with the data
[15:45:42] <flatcap> yes
[15:45:53] <dcpurton> ah - I see
[15:46:03] <flatcap> LOTS of code uses Body, but only the Dialogs use the AttachPtr
[15:46:12] <dcpurton> this doesn't happen at the moment because there isn't much special in the view of attachments
[15:46:19] <flatcap> exactly
[15:46:27] <flatcap> but it's still poor design
[15:46:36] <flatcap> it's been a common theme in Mutt's code
[15:46:57] <flatcap> redesigning would have been a nightmare, so let's just add another global variable ;-)
[15:48:24] <dcpurton> So in your dialogs your BodyView would link to Body?
[15:48:34] <dcpurton> And you'd do all you manipulation with BodyView
[15:48:38] <flatcap> yes
[15:48:53] <dcpurton> Then when you're done it's easy to write out the Body in the right order
[15:49:07] <flatcap> oh...
[15:49:26] <dcpurton> or I miss at the last step?
[15:49:38] <flatcap> I _think_ we'd have to keep the Bodys in the correct order *as* we manipulate the BodyViews
[15:49:44] <dcpurton> yes
[15:49:56] <dcpurton> But
[15:50:06] <dcpurton> You wouldn't have to worry about parents and next
[15:50:24] <flatcap> yes, I think so
[15:50:46] <dcpurton> then once the email is setup, you can link the bodies together
[15:51:16] <flatcap> hmm...
[15:51:22] <dcpurton> that way you only have to worry about order and level in BodyView
[15:51:31] <dcpurton> hmmm
[15:51:41] <dcpurton> you do need parents in bodyview though
[15:51:42] <flatcap> I hadn't imagined separate Bodys that are assembled
[15:52:06] <dcpurton> oh
[15:52:07] <flatcap> yes, BodyView will have pointers in every direction
[15:52:33] <dcpurton> but if you don't assemble at the end
[15:52:43] <dcpurton> don't you still ahve to keep two things in sync?
[15:52:50] <dcpurton> or you amigine an API does this?
[15:53:09] <dcpurton> s/amigine/imagine/
[15:53:25] <flatcap> yes, it sounds sensible -- I just hadn't considered it
[15:55:38] * flatcap thinks ...
[15:56:07] <dcpurton> remember I'm not the CS guy you are looking for‚Ä¶
[15:56:15] <flatcap> hehe
[15:56:36] <dcpurton> my software design involves seeing how I ought to have done it at the end
[15:57:03] <dcpurton> by which time my software already is a mess
[15:57:06] <flatcap> any functions that we call from compose, we're just going to pass *a* Body, or an ARRAY(Body)...
[15:57:25] <flatcap> the functions won't need them to be joined up
[15:57:28] <flatcap> :-)
[15:58:49] <dcpurton> I think that sounds right
[15:59:07] <dcpurton> You are right you'd need a file pointer though
[15:59:20] <dcpurton> but that could be kind of useful
[15:59:36] <dcpurton> ooo
[16:00:11] <dcpurton> not sure of implications but one thing that you can't do at the moment
[16:00:31] <dcpurton> is manipulate a group as a whole file while composing
[16:00:40] <dcpurton> but you can do this when you receive
[16:01:46] <flatcap> what manipulations are those?
[16:02:26] <dcpurton> you can pipe a multipart group and you get it as it appears in the email
[16:02:37] <dcpurton> with the boundaries of its parts
[16:02:43] <flatcap> ah, I see
[16:03:05] <dcpurton> but you can't do that at compose time
[16:03:12] <dcpurton> and it's probably a bad idea to code that
[16:03:28] <dcpurton> it would be a lot of effort for a not very useful feature
[16:03:57] <flatcap> ok
[16:04:42] <flatcap> oh, one requirement for creating Body->fp would be that I'd need a *root* Body in compose

[21:20:04] <mrus> hm, I seem to be unable to fork a command to background within neomutt's `startup-hook`. The ampersand doesn't seem to do the trick there, neomutt doesn't launch until I kill the command that was started.

[21:22:04] <mrus> oh, apparently its output needs to be redirected to /dev/null for that to work?
[21:41:28] <flatcap> mrus: hmm... I would have expected & to work
[21:41:46] <flatcap> escaping it seems to work though
[21:41:54] <flatcap> startup-hook 'echo `sleep 5m \&`'
[21:42:20] <flatcap> neomutt starts quickly and sleep seems to be running in the background
