[04:30:09] <FunkyBob> hmw[at]: only when combined with "decoding base64" :P
[04:30:24] <hmw[at]> Ah, right. Of course :)
[04:32:10] <FunkyBob> what makes it all the more terrible
[04:32:21] <FunkyBob> the reporter followed best ethical bug reporting processes...
[04:32:45] <FunkyBob> notified the company, coordinated releases for after the fix, etc etc
[04:33:34] <FunkyBob> who on earth is advising this politician that he thinks he has a hope in hell of not coming out of this looking a moron?
[04:34:59] <hmw[at]> Were the leaked data even bas64?
[04:36:02] <hmw[at]> Sometimes people conisder this a form of encryption. If this was the case here, I'd give that politician some cudos for even knowing *something* about what went on
[04:37:28] <FunkyBob> I'm sure somewhere I saw the SSNs were base64 encoded..
[04:38:26] <hmw[at]> Looks like they had their 16yo nephew create the web site and also explain the "hack"
[04:38:48] <FunkyBob> IMHO "You published the data on the  web, publicly... it's public data"
[04:38:58] <FunkyBob> saying he "viewed the source code" is ... highly misleading
[04:39:08] <hmw[at]> obviously
[04:39:58] <hmw[at]> But even having actual experts advising politicians doesn't help at all. Politicians in Europe constantly talk to the Chaos Computer Club and keep trying to create insane laws
[04:40:18] <FunkyBob> imagine what they'd be trying if they _didn't_ talk to them
[04:40:35] <hmw[at]> Not sure, if there is room left to go even lower :)
[04:40:44] <FunkyBob> there is... there always is
[04:40:54] <hmw[at]> Don't scare me
[04:41:11] <hmw[at]> Perhaps we should ban the Internet as a whole
[04:41:32] <FunkyBob> we should rebuilt it on well engineered protocols, at least...
[04:41:34] <hmw[at]> It's just a "passing fad" anyways
[04:41:36] <FunkyBob> rebuild, even
[04:41:43] <FunkyBob> series of toobs!
[04:42:24] <hmw[at]> The EU seems to no longer want backdoors in the actual end to end encryption, but instead they are now calling for mandatory trojans on the devices to sniff before it is encrypted and sent
[04:42:44] <hmw[at]> Like the stuff Apple has put on their phones recently
[04:47:33] <FunkyBob> AU passed some laws about being able to compel IT employees to embed monitoring into their apps
[04:47:49] <FunkyBob> there's some weakly worded caveats... but, eah
[04:48:12] <FunkyBob> very strongly worded rules to prevent letting anyone know... even canary sites

[04:50:19] <FunkyBob> as in, if I were given one of these orders, I couldn't even tell my boss I was doing it...
[04:50:26] <FunkyBob> great way to get me fired, etc?
[04:50:31] <FunkyBob> s/etc/eh/
[04:51:50] <hmw[at]> wow
[04:54:50] <hmw[at]> They certainly wouldn't be paying me enough to do something like that. I'd rather quit my job and become a carpenter
[04:55:31] <FunkyBob> well, there's this handy caveat that... you can refuse if implementing it would significantly impact the security/privacy of other users
[04:55:37] <FunkyBob> [it must be for a named target]
[04:55:50] <FunkyBob> so.. yeah... always design your systems so it's security and privacy for all
[04:57:48] <pavonia> hmw[at]: So you could bug the furniture you make? :3

[05:13:00] <Gamara> hey I was wondering why there is white space between the boarder and the image, the image is perfectly square 876x876 shrunk to 20rem/20rem, my rem is converted to 10px https://i.imgur.com/Ghzg7ZL.png the .menu__selector__image is the only property on the image, I dont see padding or anything in the box anyone have any ideas how to fix this?
[05:18:30] *** Joins: jazzy (~jaziz@user/jaziz)
[05:18:54] <hmw[at]> Gamara: Might be a rounding issue. Test it with actual px values to verify that
[05:19:41] <hmw[at]> Gamara: If you want more than just a guess, provide a live example we can use the inspector tools on
[05:19:44] <hmw[at]> `paste
[05:19:45] <Selvvir> hmw[at], These live pastebins allow us to see what you're seeing http://jsfiddle.net/ • http://codepen.io/ • http://paste.asmcbain.net/ • Screenshots can't be inspected with website debugging tools
[05:21:05] <Gamara> Alright I will do a live example :)
[05:23:29] <Gamara> thanks so much I really appreciate the help btw

[05:38:44] <Gamara> weird https://jsfiddle.net/fxmqo752/
[05:38:53] <Gamara> It seems like its fine on jsfiddle
[05:40:03] <hmw[at]> hmm
[05:40:17] <hmw[at]> That would indicate a difference between the test case and your actual page
[05:40:49] <Gamara> yeah I am using a components library
[05:41:41] <hmw[at]> Can you upload the page in question, so I get to see the error? Also, jsfiddle allows inclusion of frameworks etc, somewhere on the left side
[05:42:38] <hmw[at]> Alternatively, you can try removing things from your local page until that border disappears
[05:42:43] <hmw[at]> and work from there
[05:44:01] <Gamara> hmmm that might work thanks so much :) its for a hackathon so I havent uploaded it to github yet
[05:45:07] <hmw[at]> If you don't mind a cheap and dirty hack, you can probably get rid of that border with a negative margin on the img
[05:47:04] <FunkyBob> what are we trying to fix?
[05:47:14] <FunkyBob> i see the fiddle... what's the fault?
[05:47:32] <hmw[at]> the fiddle doesn't show the fault; The original has a white border to the left and bottom of the imgs
[05:48:00] <hmw[at]> https://i.imgur.com/Ghzg7ZL.png <-- screenshot of the original question
[05:48:15] <FunkyBob> and they want that?
[05:48:19] <hmw[at]> no
[05:48:36] <hmw[at]> Looks like some gadget library is causing that
[05:49:01] <Gamara> Seems not specifying padding width fixes the issue but then im just stuck with a think boarder not the end of the world
[05:49:41] <Gamara> I am using material ui (not the weird one that doesnt let you use css)
[05:49:51] <hmw[at]> Gamara: Try padding with a unit. padding:0; is invalid
[05:50:54] <Gamara> Yeah didnt work, also tried changing width/height units to px also didnt work
[05:51:42] <hmw[at]> hm. padding:0; seems to work though
[05:54:37] <Gamara> I appreciate the help greatly you guys are awesome but I think I am just not going to set a padding width, I think it looks ok with default boarder size since its not giving me the bug lol https://i.imgur.com/hAdT58K.png

[12:07:47] <FunkyBob> heh
[12:07:59] <thykka> undefined_bob, try grabbing a random person from the street and see if they can google themselves out of a programming problem.
[12:08:05] <doc> undefined_bob: that's what I said ;)
[12:08:07] <hassoon> doc: ya bosses not knowing what you should do or what your field of speciality is is a red flag of a company to avoid
[12:08:10] *** Quits: pyra (~pyra@user/pyra) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:08:16] <thykka> a developer should succeed, because they have prior knowledge of WHAT to even search for
[12:08:19] <hassoon> doc: gossip, noise and bs as well
[12:08:31] <thykka> and that's the expertise a dev gets paid for
[12:08:40] *** Joins: pyra (~pyra@user/pyra)
[12:08:42] <doc> hassoon: not at all. They need to know what they need to do, they need to know they can figure out what they need to do. They don't need to know what I need to do, they just need to know that I can do it, or figure out how.
[12:09:10] <hmw[at]> Know the story of the ocean liner that had a broken engine, and they had an engineer come in via helicopter? The thing about one hit with a hammer for $10000
[12:09:11] <doc> if we all knew the same things they wouldn't need me and I wouldn't need them. Division of labour
[12:09:18] <undefined_bob> we currently have a critical incident at our online shop. Customers are seeing prices of other customers and the devs dont know why or how nor how to fix it yet
[12:09:33] <hmw[at]> ($1 for the hit, $9999 for knowing where to)
[12:09:34] <thykka> sounds like a CDN issue
[12:09:41] <doc> undefined_bob: oof
[12:09:45] <undefined_bob> company is loosing money every minute and boss is mad
[12:10:19] <thykka> undefined_bob, do the pages get cached? if so, i'm betting someone is caching user-specific pages, which commonly leads to that kind of problwem
[12:10:20] <doc> you should probably get off IRC and get to fixing that :)
[12:10:20] <undefined_bob> its like the database is picking random prices and ignoring the customers ID
[12:10:39] <stenno> doc: my thoughts exactly :D
[12:10:40] <oksushi> undefined_bob: ouch. Is this some kind of custom system?
[12:10:47] <undefined_bob> doc: nah, I gave it to the devs, there is nothing I can do
[12:10:50] <hmw[at]> undefined_bob: Like if you look at flight prices from an Apple device, you get to pay more?
[12:11:01] <doc> hassoon: see? boss thinking right there in undefined_bob
[12:11:12] <hmw[at]> heheh
[12:11:13] <undefined_bob> oksushi: kinda, its a modified shop software/system
[12:11:25] *** Quits: DrJ (~asdf@user/drj) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:11:29] <hmw[at]> Sounds pretty horrible
[12:11:31] <thykka> tell your devs to check their caching strategy. the issue lies there with 99% probability
[12:11:57] <undefined_bob> it is just weird that it happened 'out of nowhere'
[12:12:06] <oksushi> ecommerce is hard
[12:12:10] <hmw[at]> Well. It won't tell you 2 weeks ahead
[12:12:19] <stenno> ecommerce is a disgusting beast
[12:12:20] <doc> so inconsiderate
[12:12:24] <oksushi> easy on the surface, all manner of gotchas swimming around underneath
[12:12:31] <undefined_bob> but that would be kind, hmw[at]
[12:13:01] <hmw[at]> I wouldn't touch payment systems. Maybe incorportate a known one, but never trying to write my own or modify, or in any way, shape or form be responsible
[12:13:15] <doc> that's a team job
[12:13:49] <hmw[at]> Software is impossible. I am still amazed, that the internet still works.
[12:13:51] <thykka> I love it when people ask for a quote for their simple website, with just simple stuff, like a product catalog, shopping cart and ordering pipeline x)
[12:13:58] <undefined_bob> and maybe it only happen to customers who got an ID from the system and not one of the internal CMS
[12:14:01] <doc> hmw[at]: "works", like the leaning tower of pisa
[12:14:47] <undefined_bob> lol thykka yes. 'its so simple - everyone got it. 50 bucks?'
[12:14:52] <hmw[at]> Well. I would have expected severe disruptions in 2010 at the latest. We are still here and can chat. How??
[12:15:02] <undefined_bob> magic
[12:15:18] <thykka> i mean sure, you can get a storefront for 50 bucks, but you're gonna have to get it from Shopify and set it up yourself
[12:15:23] <hmw[at]> Hm. Guess so.
[12:15:29] <doc> IRC barely counts as the internet. Shoving text down a wire, netsplits every 42 seconds.
[12:15:42] <hmw[at]> I just say DNS
[12:16:00] <hmw[at]> Unless there are some highly secret protection systems, nobody knows about...
[12:16:23] <doc> distributed systems are great
[12:16:32] <hmw[at]> But I am prepared. I have a stash of nice little micro controllers and retro computers. I am not going to be bored because Steam suddenly stops.
[12:16:38] <undefined_bob> maybe its also just only luck or coincidence
[12:16:47] *** Joins: chao (~stenno@user/stenno)
[12:16:51] <hmw[at]> My fear is that it's just luck
[12:16:56] <hassoon> doc: what i meant by that is that a boss who fails to know what you exactly should do regarding your speciality and career path, will give you tasks that are not supposed to be given to you at all
[12:17:26] <hassoon> doc: add to that the general disorder of the work process
[12:17:31] <undefined_bob> yeah, I always get Adobe Photoshop and even Illustrator tasks. I have no clue of that
[12:17:43] <doc> hassoon: if shit was easy, every idiot would do it
[12:17:44] <hmw[at]> lol
[12:18:10] <doc> instead it's just our level of idiots :)
[12:18:20] <hmw[at]> Still a majority of web devs are pretty clueless
[12:18:21] <hassoon> what ?
[12:18:41] <undefined_bob> I mean they think just because I do 'something with computers' I must also be a professional graphics designer
[12:18:43] <hassoon> ya you tell a frontend developer to do a UX designer work ? that's an epic joke
[12:18:44] <doc> hmw[at]: the majority of people doing the majority of things are clueless.
[12:18:49] <doc> all just winging it
[12:18:51] <hassoon> happened to me alot lately
[12:18:55] <hmw[at]> doc: Well. Guess I have to agree :)
[12:19:15] *** Quits: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[12:19:22] <doc> exceptions (to majority) would be experienced doctors and engineers, etc. and even they make mistakes.
[12:19:34] <doc> politicians, journalists? pfft
[12:20:24] <doc> Uncle Bob makes a great point, developer numbers are growing exponentially. At any point in time about 50% of developers have less than 5 years of experience (or something along those lines)
[12:20:42] <hmw[at]> 5 years is nothing
[12:20:45] <doc> I can't remember the exact number
[12:20:49] <doc> exactly, clueless :)
[12:21:11] <doc> Shit, I've been doing this for a multiple of that and I still feel clueless sometimes
[12:21:42] <hmw[at]> You'll always feel like that heheh
[12:22:04] *** Joins: DrJ (~asdf@user/drj)
[12:22:06] <doc> yup, and if I don't every once in a while, I've probably given up or gotten burnt out, again
[12:23:09] <hassoon> hmw[at]: 5 years of experience is recognized in job markets
[12:23:22] <hmw[at]> Well. There lies the problem.
[12:23:49] <hmw[at]> I wouldn't trust a programmer with less than 10 years experience. Ideally 30.
[12:23:51] <hassoon> hmw[at]: you'll likely reach the interview phase at least imo
[12:24:00] <doc> hassoon: recognised, but not necessarily super experienced.
[12:24:14] <hassoon> hmw[at]: lel, don't become an employer
[12:24:35] <hmw[at]> Sadly, I was serious
[12:24:45] * doc goes zZzZz 
[12:24:46] <doc> night
[12:24:54] <hassoon> doc: many job markets consider 5 years of experience as senior level
[12:25:03] <hassoon> doc: but ya, tough markets won't consider that alot
[12:25:13] <hassoon> saw that toughness in far eastern job markets
[12:25:14] <doc> hassoon: and I reiterate, that doesn't make them super experienced
[12:25:20] <hassoon> e.g singapore job offers, etc
[12:25:37] <hmw[at]> It will be fine, friends
[12:25:46] <doc> hassoon: you can put a "made in singapore" label on a battery, but if it's coming from amazon it's really made in China.
[12:26:03] <hmw[at]> We just have to add a few more frameworks, potentially AI based ones on top of everything and it will work itself out
[12:26:16] <hassoon> doc: meh you'll consider making the interview with them at least, then know if they are good or not, unless you are strictly seeking for super experienced workers like those with 10+ years of experience in the field
[12:27:06] <hassoon> 10+ years of experience? d'oh
[12:27:19] <hassoon> just made it to 5 this month
[12:27:34] <hmw[at]> You should change your view on job intervies. It is not them testing if YOU are good enough. It is the other way around :)
[12:28:29] <hmw[at]> Someone once tried to hire me to make web pages that intentionally don't work in any browser but IE. I seriously would have had to put extra effort into working so badly
[12:28:58] <hmw[at]> He also wanted to pay me 100€ per web site I make
[12:29:01] <hmw[at]> lol

[12:38:07] <undefined_bob> yeah, I'm going to share it, if I can. If not I'll tell you guys that
[12:39:03] <undefined_bob> I think it has something to do with the system generated customer IDs. Because we normally dont use them but recently we had
[12:39:36] <undefined_bob> normally all new customers get an ID from our CMS and not from the shop system
[12:40:24] <undefined_bob> so that we can connect the customer and his special prices. But if they dont have special prices, we dont need that connection, so we use the shop system ID for them
[12:40:45] <undefined_bob> but I have to wait for the devs
[12:41:17] <hmw[at]> Is looking at the source of my own web site also considered illegal hacking? :)
