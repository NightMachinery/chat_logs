[07:42:17] <PaulWay[w]> Hi all
[07:43:23] <PaulWay[w]> I'd like to learn ways of implementing a site with Django that uses HTML pages that load Javascript that then do API calls to get data.
[07:43:59] <PaulWay[w]> Is that a stupid idea?  Should I just use views that display HTML templates that fetch the data, with Javascript to do extra API calls when needed?

[08:19:08] <shangxiao> PaulWay[w]: So multiple, separate pages? Sounds like what a lot of sites do: a hybrid SPA/MPA approach.
[08:20:27] <shangxiao> azlev: you could use that app and then just write your own rest api that interfaces with it

[17:51:49] <Wooble> ^^ fairly good argument for using 1-item lists instead of 1-item tuples where possible. :)

[19:23:12] <theseb> I did that and ran into issues...I posted details here if anyone minds helping... https://groups.google.com/g/django-users/c/IYAr438-uPk
[19:23:24] <theseb> basically a list comprehension doesn't work in the django shell
[19:23:28] <theseb> dunno why not
[19:23:33] <Wooble> theseb: they write a management command.
[19:23:35] <shangxiao> weren't you just asking this on #python? 🤔
[19:23:51] <Wooble> theseb: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/howto/custom-management-commands/
[19:23:57] <VaniaPy> shangxiao i mean i put and didn't give me any result :P
[19:24:57] <theseb> shangxiao: yes! and Yhg1s the genius said this 'django shell' behaves differently than a normal python shell...that got me intrigued to figure out the details
[19:25:17] <Wooble> tbh piping code to the regular python repl is also probably a bad idea.
[19:25:56] <shangxiao> VaniaPy: how do you mean? what happens when you inspect self.renderer_classes?  it has a value of type "type"
[19:26:27] <shangxiao> VaniaPy: looking at the value of it will show you what setting is mucked up
[19:27:19] <shangxiao> theseb: interesting idea I've never met anyone who's tried to pipe python code into a repl before xD
[19:27:23] <VaniaPy> shangxiao the statement "renderer_classes" appears in the error's traceback only
[19:27:37] <theseb> Wooble: thanks....that link shows you how to create new command you can reuse.....What do you when you want to quickly tweak the value of an object in a one-off way? I doubt you write a one-off admin command?
[19:27:53] <shangxiao> VaniaPy: let's be honest you didn't put a breakpoint on that exception line did you ;)
[19:27:53] <Wooble> theseb: you can always delete it after running it.
[19:28:06] <theseb> Wooble: tbh i've never used the django admin interface...i wonder if that would help here
[19:28:18] <theseb> Wooble: ok..so you DO use that for everything
[19:28:20] <theseb> that's fine
[19:28:21] <Wooble> theseb: you can also write a plain script that does some setup to get the django bits, but it's not recommended.
[19:28:26] <theseb> that's what i was trying to figure out
[19:28:27] <theseb> thanks
[19:29:31] <Wooble> I'm not sure the django docs even tell you how to do this. I found it on stackoverflow and did it, and regretted it. :)
[19:29:55] <shangxiao> write a plain script? yep they do
[19:30:14] <shangxiao> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/settings/#calling-django-setup-is-required-for-standalone-django-usage
[19:30:47] <Wooble> ah, I searched for setup() and missed that.
[19:30:56] <theseb> Wooble: lol
[19:31:23] <shangxiao> well, the django docs can be hard to search ;)
[19:31:44] <VaniaPy> shangxiao how can this be done? you mean to put a breakpoint on the terminal?
[19:32:10] <theseb> Wooble, shangxiao: there is something weird going on here....everyone needs to tweak model objects now and then....but the best practices for this are somehow hidden/taboo/unknown/secret/hard to find
[19:32:19] <shangxiao> VaniaPy: how do you work with your code? PyCharm/some other IDE or a regular text edotir?
[19:32:32] <shangxiao> editor*
[19:32:34] <VaniaPy> shangxiao currently on PyCharm
[19:32:46] <theseb> So everyone does their work in secret and is ashamed of what they're doing
[19:33:06] <Wooble> theseb: ideally you don't need to mess with your data from outside the app becase you designed well. :)
[19:33:36] <Wooble> (or you write a data migration)
[19:33:36] <shangxiao> VaniaPy: assuming the project is setup correctly, you can open that file "rest_framework/views.py" and place a breakpoint on line 158
[19:35:24] <shangxiao> theseb: is this a 1-time thing or do you want to do it again?
[19:36:26] <theseb> shangxiao: different tasks some up often..some are 1-off...some patterns repeat
[19:36:37] <shangxiao> VaniaPy: iirc you can find that file under "site-packages" or something similar, it's been a while since I've used PyCharm but it has the ability to import all the libs under the site-packages directory.
[19:37:29] <shangxiao> theseb: then write a management command for the repat ones, use shell (better shell_plus) for the 1 time things
[19:38:24] <shangxiao> theseb: I can't remember if the core shell command supports ipython but shell_plus does
[19:38:24] <theseb> Wooble: but wait...suppose you had an ecommerce Django with a postgres DB....as the webapp evolves won't you find yourself wanting to delete columns...rename columns...etc?
[19:38:37] <shangxiao> migrations
[19:39:19] <theseb> shangxiao: what..what is shell plus?
[19:39:27] <theseb> shangxiao: ./manage shellplus?
[19:39:38] <theseb> ./manage.py shell plus?
[19:39:42] <shangxiao> theseb: do yourself a favour and install "django-extensions" ;)
[19:39:49] <shangxiao> it has all sorts of goodies
[19:41:43] <shangxiao> shell_plus, show_ulrs are the 2 main ones but it even has a command to generate a command for you!!
[19:41:52] <shangxiao> boilerplate that is
[19:41:58] <theseb> i see
[19:42:25] <shangxiao> anyway my point is shell_plus supports ipython which has a superior repl to help you edit code

[22:36:20] <avivace> It worked at some point, but now I may have touched something and starting from the freshly-cloned repository doesn't create the tables anymore (makemigrations -> migrate)
[22:37:52] <avivace> Oh, I found that I needed to run `manage.py makemigrations <name-of-the-app>`. Is this normal?
[22:37:56] <GinFuyou> avivace, it creates migrations for all installed models if app has migrations module
[22:38:16] <GinFuyou> If you have removed migrations module I think it is
[22:53:53] <dang`r`us> avivace, django stores migrations state in a dedicated table
