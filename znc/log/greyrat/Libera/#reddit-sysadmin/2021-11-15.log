[04:47:25] <JollyRoger> JollyRgrs: that never occurred to me before, I'm going to try that out sometime!
[04:48:18] <JollyRoger> I haven't got an instant pot of my own yet, but a friend of mine does. We found it works great for making stocks and soups, just throw all of the bones into the instant pot and fill it with water, add some salt and delicious bone broth comes back out.
[04:49:08] <JollyRgrs> also any time we put chicken in there (many times just garlic powder and salt), you get an awesome chicken stock
[04:49:47] <cryptic1> I still prefer oven baked chicken over instapot chicken
[04:50:48] <yuken> hahahahahahahahahahahaha https://mansfield.craigslist.org/clt/d/ashland-copy-transfer-duplicating/7407873282.html
[04:50:51] <yuken> HAHAHAHAHAHA
[04:50:57] <JollyRgrs> when we instant pot our chicken, it is usually for easy to make pulled chicken
[04:51:08] <JollyRgrs> otherwise, i prefer to grill it
[04:51:09] <yuken> who in their right mind would pay $1500 for this thing.

[05:20:11] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Flies don’t have teeth. Instead, they have a long tongue called a proboscis, which sucks up food like a straw. Some flies drink nectar or blood. House flies like the food we eat. When a fly lands on your lunch, it vomits on the food. Acids in the vomit dissolve the food so the fly can suck it up. Disgusting!

[13:53:14] <lancehead> I'm currently reinstalling someone's windows because fuck me I guess 
[13:53:46] <Activ8> tying loose ends is a good way of saying it
[13:54:10] <lancehead> Machine had a reallllyyyy old image on it and was starting to slow down super bad on startup/login, and for some reason windows update was turned off and wouldn't turn on 
[13:54:21] <Activ8> I'm done with 1 of my tickets for setting up email addresses and assigning licences 
[13:54:22] <lancehead> So now I gotta reinstall :^) because our IT support people can't do it remotely 
[13:54:48] <lancehead> Exciting work! @ Activ8
[13:54:49] <SirSceptalot> you could always try an in-place upgrade

[13:55:26] <lancehead> SirSceptalot, that tends to keep issues like this unfortunately 
[13:55:40] <lancehead> It's incredibly slow to boot and log into our AD

[17:45:45] <Activ8> The amount of Apple devices that are useless because people either A) forget their password, B) can’t access their phone or email and C) can’t prove they purchased the device.  That’s why when you sell a device you need to remove the lock before selling.  Otherwise it’s locked to the person you purchased it from
[17:46:56] <SirSceptalot> As much as I don't like apple, I do assume it's a pretty descent theft deterrent though.
[17:47:01] <Activ8> Apple won’t unlock a purchased device from someone else unless they get in touch with Apple with proof of purchase themselves
[17:47:21] <SirSceptalot> or at the very least a "buying stolen apple shit" deterrent
[17:47:38] <Activ8> That’s the point of security to render the device useless so people can’t either reuse the device or get your data lol

[23:28:51] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> My old boss was into bow hunting but was terrible at it. I think he brought home 1 deer in like 5 years that he was my boss.
[23:29:54] <Jaelae> i hate talking to a vendor about one product and they try to upsell me on a suite
[23:30:41] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> How else do you think Chad McSalesman is gonna afford his 2nd yacht
[23:30:58] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> And 2nd family. That bro has like 6 mouths to feed
[23:31:08] <Jaelae> we have a use case for this storage - ok what you need is our stack of network+compute 
[23:31:14] <Jaelae> but i dont want that
[23:31:33] <mistiry> !flyfact
[23:31:33] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Flies don’t have teeth. Instead, they have a long tongue called a proboscis, which sucks up food like a straw. Some flies drink nectar or blood. House flies like the food we eat. When a fly lands on your lunch, it vomits on the food. Acids in the vomit dissolve the food so the fly can suck it up. Disgusting!
[23:32:25] <sd> 11<S​eth> Thanks, now I __definitely__ won't eat me food after a fly touches it.
[23:34:05] <Riviera> did you not read, it's not the touching, it is the vomitting and the predigesting that happens!
[23:34:41] <sd> 11<S​eth> I was implying that, if the fly touches it, it's most likely to start vomiting and predigesting right after.
[23:34:56] <sd> 11<S​eth> Or I thought it was implied :P
[23:37:23] <Riviera> hehe
[23:38:27] <sd> 06<s​tig124> That's something I like Linux for, it's that printing doesn't suck *that much*, CUPS is really good
[23:39:17] <sd> 06<s​tig124> Except if you run Canon, of course

[23:50:19] <TurkeyGibby> !flyfact
[23:50:19] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Like butterflies, flies can taste food using their feet! This is all down to taste receptors (chemonsensilla) being located on their lower legs and feet. When a fly lands on a tasty meal, which can be anything from animal feces to your lunch, they will often wander around to give their next meal a good taste before consuming it.
