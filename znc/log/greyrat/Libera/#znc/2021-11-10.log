[11:55:01] <chep> Hi
[11:56:05] <bookworm> welcome
[11:56:23] <chep> I still have timeout issues with liberachat and started znc with -D. I don't really know how to read the log but the ping seems to stop working
[11:56:36] <chep> http://ix.io/3EyU
[11:57:14] <chep> during the same time a ping command to the server IP was executed in a terminal and I got 0% packet loss
[11:57:48] <chep> "[:erbium.libera.chat PONG erbium.libera.chat :1636531936]" seems to be replaced by "[:localhost PONG localhost :1636531955]" what does it mean?
[11:58:36] <chep> no sorry that was bitlbee
[12:02:09] <chep> there is no pong from liberachat :-/
[12:04:34] <chep> but ping in terminal works...
[12:04:49] <bookworm> (just for the record, ZNC on Arch has absolutely no problems with libera in the general case. It's not a distro problem)
[12:06:13] <bookworm> ping on the host uses a completely different protocol though (ICMP)
[12:06:38] <chep> irc ping is a sapecific protocol?
[12:06:45] <bookworm> rather than the TCP connection you probably have with the ircd
[12:08:01] <bookworm> if you want to test that it's a znc problem, fire up a irc bot that literally just responds to pings
[12:09:58] <chep> bookworm: I don't understand what you are talking about
[12:11:10] <bookworm> you are essentially saying that it's a znc problem because look the letter I sent with the postman arrived at the destination, why didn't the package I sent to the same address with FedEx arrive?
[12:11:44] *** Quits: redgloboli (~redglobol@user/redgloboli) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[12:11:45] <bookworm> now, your local post probably doesn't have much to do with fedex, besides traveling on the same roads
[12:11:45] <chep> :-D
[12:12:30] <chep> I understand what you are saying about the protocols, it's the part with the irc bot that i don't understand
[12:12:53] <bookworm> well, use something else that actually talks the same protocol, aka IRC
[12:13:14] <chep> you mean outside znc?
[12:13:18] <bookworm> yes
[12:13:24] <chep> ok
[12:13:59] <bookworm> and now you can either telnet there and hit pong every few seconds or you use a bot, your choice ;P
[12:14:29] <chep> thanks

[19:39:55] <Release_> greetz, i was curious how to set the timezones and include DST settings ?
[19:40:12] <Release_> as currently it doesnt seem to take effect yet
[19:40:35] <Release_> when setting timezone
[19:41:17] *** Quits: i64 (i64@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/i64) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[19:45:04] <Khaytsus> Release_: for buffer playback?
[19:45:15] <Release_> yes
[19:45:21] <Khaytsus> https://wiki.znc.in/Configuration   see here, Timezone
[19:45:29] <Khaytsus> Perhaps your client supports server time?
[19:46:26] <Release_> yea
[19:46:37] <Release_> i guess it takes from system time right ?
[19:47:01] <Release_> altho not sure how it works
[19:47:05] <Khaytsus> I assume the irc server in this case tells the client its timezone and the client does things with it.  Not sure offhand.
[19:47:14] <Khaytsus> But those settings aren't used if server-time is.
[19:47:37] <Release_> not sure i understand
[19:47:54] <Khaytsus> What client do you use
[19:48:28] <Release_> does it depend on client used ?
[19:48:45] <Release_> i thought znc sends the timestamps for buffer playback ?
[19:48:51] <Release_> and not the client used
[19:48:54] <Khaytsus> https://ircv3.net/software/clients
[19:49:02] <Khaytsus> Look at server-time
[19:49:20] <Khaytsus> Server time is an ircv3 cap
[19:49:44] <Release_> znc takes time from the ircd ?
[19:50:08] <Khaytsus> So it should show in local time for you in clients that support server-time regardless of what tz the znc or client are in.
[19:50:13] <Khaytsus> Without any config
[19:50:27] <Khaytsus> What's the actual issue, perhaps I should have started there.
[19:50:33] <Release_> im speaking of the buffer playback time tho
[19:50:41] <Release_> not the time used by local client
[19:50:52] <Khaytsus> Yes, which is waht I already said....... buffer playback
[19:51:10] <Khaytsus> Was my very first question
[19:51:16] <Release_> thats why i was confused u mentioned clients
[19:51:50] <Release_> as currrent time used by local client is never the same as time used in buffer playback
[19:52:11] <Release_> i wanted to focus on the time used by buffer playback
[19:52:19] <Khaytsus> .........
[19:52:23] <Release_> especially DST
[19:52:25] <Khaytsus> Buffer playback is what is affected by this.
[19:52:29] <Khaytsus> What is the actual issue
[19:52:45] <Release_> it displays the time one hour behind
[19:52:50] <Release_> so DST wasnt applied
[19:52:57] <Khaytsus> And what client are you using
[19:53:00] <Release_> mirc
[19:53:24] <Release_> does znc get time from mirc ?
[19:53:47] <Khaytsus> Again, look at the link I sent before.
[19:53:52] <Khaytsus> Mirc supports server-time
[19:53:57] <Release_> im confused what to search for
[19:54:04] <Khaytsus> therefore mirc is telling znc what to show it
[19:54:24] <Release_> and if i dont wanne use that but use default ?
[19:54:35] <Release_> as it seems complex and i wanne keep things simple
[19:54:46] <Khaytsus> It's not complicated, it's utterly simple.  It's automatic.
[19:54:57] <Khaytsus> Your local system is the problem.
[19:55:07] <Release_> i checked system time
[19:55:12] <Release_> and it seems ok
[19:55:16] <Release_> with dst aplied
[19:55:20] <Release_> let me check again
[19:55:53] <Khaytsus> Maybe relaunch mirc.  NO idea.
[19:55:54] <Release_> yep
[19:56:11] <Release_> it was fine before the DST has started
[19:56:22] <Release_> and system DST is set fine
[19:57:22] <Release_> yep ur right
[19:57:31] <Release_> sorry for misunderstanding
[19:57:37] <Release_> ircd time is off
[19:58:17] <Release_> let me see if i can reset that

[20:02:16] <Khaytsus> Ah, the ircd itself was wrong?  Interesting, I guess everything is told the timezone down the chain, if the ircd is wrong, everything is wrong ;)
[20:02:52] <Release_> yep seems that way
