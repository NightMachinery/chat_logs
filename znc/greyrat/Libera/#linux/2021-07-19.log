[01:00:35] <msiism> pyzozord: KDE and Gnome being integrated desktop application suites, there is quite a lot of stuff the respective programs share, and you will probably pull that in (huge libraries) at some point. This is not the same as installing the whole DE, though.

[10:47:03] <kirk781> loganlee, after transfership to Andrew Lee, the new formation decided to start from scratch and wiped everything for no reason
[10:47:08] <evilscreww> what does got into ownership of freenode but not the network mean
[10:47:37] <evilscreww> i thought freenode was a network
[10:47:56] <evilscreww> was this guy butt-hurt about some ban he received so he decided to buy the whole thing out and take over and enforce his own views
[10:48:04] <evilscreww> or was he just a rando commando from the street
[10:48:17] <astronaut> evilscreww, why do you think so. I am quite literally the opposite. I believe that though capitalism has it's flaws, no other economic system pulls it's people out of poverty faster than capitalism. it may not be the best system, but it is the best we have.

[17:06:44] <TomyWork> we have a 1 GB file that our CI builds regularly. that file is a .zip file containing a bunch of .jar files (which are basically .zip files). between builds, barely anything changes, but due to compression, regular binary diff isn't as efficient as it could be. Is there some advanced, recursively zip-aware binary diff or something like that? :)

[23:53:46] <Guest84> I'm wondering how to do snapshots on other distros
[23:53:58] <c705> dd is an awful way to back up data. not to mention shnapshots have nothing to do with rolling release or not

[23:54:37] <c705> yes, btrfs lvm..both work on any other distro

[23:55:14] <greatcoof> can i use it no copy over my system to other hardware?
[23:55:20] <greatcoof> *to
[23:55:32] <c705> its awful because if you're doing incramental backups (which you should unless you're in a very specific circumstance) then you're backing up the same data multiple times

[23:55:34] <themachine> dd is a great way to make a certain type of backup
[23:55:42] <themachine> but image backups are generally far from ideal
[23:55:46] <c705> ^
[23:55:48] <Guest84> How do use dd to backup data?
[23:55:51] <[jamez]> dd is a horrible snapshot because it's slow and it's copying unused data, and it isn't a snapshot at all since it's always a full copy.
