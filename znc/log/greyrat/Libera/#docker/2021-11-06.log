[00:47:33] <rawtaz> thanks, will read
[00:47:55] <rawtaz> devslash: what reverse proxy are you using and have you mounted the docker socket into its container?
[00:48:03] <devslash> Traefik
[00:48:10] <devslash> i'll explain why im concerned
[00:48:47] <devslash> I set up Authelia yesterday so when I visit one of my web apps if I'm not logged in, it redirects me to login.mydomain.com
[00:49:24] <devslash> I just checked the logs for authelia and see 3 login attempts from so called usernames and ip addresses that I am not familiar with

[00:50:17] <marrold> Hello, is there example for using buildx + Docker Hub to automatically build for multiple architectures?
[00:51:06] <devslash> when I set up Authelia yesterday, it was at the address authelia.mydomain.com. I changed it this morning to login.mydomain.com and just in the short while after I did that, I got 3 login attempts
[00:51:08] <BtbN> If you expose anythong to the internet, it will get bots trying passwords
[00:51:13] <BtbN> that's just a way of nature now

[01:12:39] <rawtaz> the topmost warning section with its references and solutions
[01:16:49] <devslash> right
[01:16:59] <devslash> well the traefik dashboard is protected by Authelia
[01:18:02] *** Joins: nickdiazswag209 (~bjpenn_@55.sub-174-194-206.myvzw.com)
[01:18:14] <devslash> In my Traefik compose, I'm binding to docker.sock. That's what the article refers to rigght ?
[01:20:13] <rawtaz> yeah that splendid summary in the link i gave you sums up the issue with security around that docker socket you hand into the traefik container.
[01:20:31] <devslash> ok so I also have these 2 commands in my compose: 
[01:20:32] <devslash>  - --providers.docker
[01:20:32] <devslash>             - --providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false
[01:20:33] <rawtaz> and FWIW just because traefik forwards to authelia doesnt mean traefik isnt vulnerable
[01:20:55] <devslash> nothing is 100% untouchable
[01:21:12] <devslash> but if its running over https only that should make it more secure
[01:21:16] <rawtaz> yeah that second one means you have to specify which containers should be made accessible by traefik
[01:21:34] <rawtaz> uh yes but we're talking about the socket security 
[01:21:51] <devslash> what do you mean made accessible by Traefik
[01:22:06] <rawtaz> what do you think that - --providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false does ?
[01:22:19] <devslash> does that have to do with the fact that i specify the Traefik labels for each service
[01:22:38] <devslash> I think that it means that it does not expose the API by default
[01:23:43] <rawtaz> this is what it means: https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/docker/#exposedbydefault
[01:23:53] <devslash> right
[01:23:57] <devslash> thats what I just said...
[01:24:15] <rawtaz> well you said expose the API, im not sure hwo that relates to exposing containers or not :)
[01:24:18] <rawtaz> anyway
[01:24:29] <devslash> I add labels to each compose and one of the traefik labels is enabled=true
[01:24:44] <rawtaz> i just wanted to point you to the docker socket thing in the link i gave you earlier. its very important to understand that when you run a reverse proxy or any container that gets the socket injected
[01:24:57] <devslash> so my socker is protected this way no ?
[01:24:58] <rawtaz> a compromise of the software can lead to a full compromise of the entire host
[01:25:07] <rawtaz> yeah i do that too.
[01:25:08] <rawtaz> no. 
[01:25:16] <rawtaz> what you are talking about now has NOTHING to do with what im talking about
[01:25:22] <rawtaz> we're talking about two different htings
[01:25:29] <devslash> oh ok
[01:26:11] <devslash> the API is protected because its not automatically exposed
[01:26:25] <rawtaz> which API are you referring to?
[01:26:27] <devslash> but since I'm still binding to docker.sock, its still vulnerable 
[01:26:59] <devslash> provider
[01:27:50] <rawtaz> i dont know what youre talking about. the exposeByDefault setting has nothing to do with an API. it controls whether or not traefik automatically exposes/processes containers.
[01:27:59] <rawtaz> if you have it set to false, which you do, thats indeed good.
[01:27:59] <devslash> ok
[01:28:20] <rawtaz> but that has nothing to do with securing the docker.sock file you give to traefik
[01:28:46] <devslash> the article makes it sound like binding to docker.sock is not a secure practice
[01:28:48] <rawtaz> the artcle i linked you to is a great summary and it contains superb references to other short articles that explain what that is about
[01:28:56] <rawtaz> yes basically thats the case
[01:29:06] <DoofusCanadensis> it's not
[01:29:16] <DoofusCanadensis> it's not a secure practice
[01:29:22] <rawtaz> in short, if there's a compromise of your traefik or its container, the attacker can compromise your entire host, unless you take extra measures against it
[01:29:27] <devslash> https://medium.com/@containeroo/traefik-2-0-paranoid-about-mounting-var-run-docker-sock-22da9cb3e78c
[01:30:07] <rawtaz> normally you dont inject the docker socket into your containres so its not that common to have to think about it. but with traefik you do because you want it to be able to read the labels of other containres, which is does using the docker socket/API
[01:30:17] <rawtaz> thats a nice article i think
[01:30:40] <devslash> im going to try that out
[01:31:04] *** Joins: shalok (~shalok@user/shalok)

[01:31:35] <rawtaz> and then im thinking of writing a simple Go application that does the same thing, but that is more lightweight than what haproxy is
[01:32:03] <devslash> why do you use haproxy if you use traefik 
[01:32:04] <rawtaz> for this very specific use case it would seem sensible to have an absolutely minimal software to control the socket access
[01:32:16] <rawtaz> so maybe when i get around to it in like ten years ill write that :D
[01:32:43] <rawtaz> devslash: i dont. but as you can read in that article you linked to, the little docker-socket-proxy thing is simply an instance of haproxy with a small config file (pretty genius :D)
[01:32:51] <devslash> oh nice

[01:42:58] <devslash> because in my Traefik, I disabled the volume mount that mounts docker.sock and replaced it with a command that looks like this: "- --providers.docker.endpoint=tcp://socket-proxy:2375"

[01:43:53] <rawtaz> you should be ablet o do the same and control which API calls or similar are allowed  using the proxy

[01:54:30] <rawtaz> assuming a "remote" on portainer is a docker server that portainer is supposed to interact with, i *think* this might be what we were looking for to tell it to use a tcp socket instead of the filesystem one: https://docs.portainer.io/v/ce-2.9/admin/environments/add/api#remote-endpoint

[02:33:59] <nickdiazswag209> hey, im basing my image on https://github.com/SumoLogic/fluentd-kubernetes-sumologic/blob/v2.4.2/Dockerfile, but there are vulns since its no longer supported, so i'm trying to patch this. However it seems i can't build it due to line 30 on there, (mkdir -p /mnt/pos, no permissions to perform the command), but obviously this was able to be built. I just can't figure out how they ever got it to 
[02:34:05] <nickdiazswag209> work. Anyone have any ideas?
[02:38:05] <BtbN> Are you running rootless docker or something? You should always have permission for that.
[02:38:21] <BtbN> Or did you change to another user in the Dockerfile before that?
[02:38:35] <nickdiazswag209> that image bases on another image which runs as the fluentd user
[02:38:47] <BtbN> Yeah, you need to be root to run that
[02:38:56] <nickdiazswag209> i wonder how they ever got it built before
[02:39:04] <BtbN> Probably were root
[02:40:01] *** Quits: Piraty (~irc@user/piraty) (Quit: -)
[02:40:15] <nickdiazswag209> yeah thats what im thinking, i just cant figure out how that could have happened. It bases on an image that runs as fluentd user, so maybe that image was changed from running as root, to use fluentd? I kind of doubt that, since i would expect a change like that would have triggered another build under a new tag

[02:41:56] <nickdiazswag209> BtbN: thanks for confirming :)
[02:42:05] <nickdiazswag209> it's gotta be root, ill try and figure out what changed, since something must have changed
[03:03:14] <nickdiazswag209> is it possible to get the exact Dockerfile that was used to generate an image thats hosted in dockerhub? Right now i'm just going to the github repo, but it seems the repo's Dockerfile changed, and im not sure if the image hosted in dockerhub is from this repo's revision of the Dockerfile
