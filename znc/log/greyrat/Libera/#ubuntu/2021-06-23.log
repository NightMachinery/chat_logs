[07:49:09] <alzgh> good vibes
[07:53:40] <alzgh> so as I understand Ubuntu LTS has a rolling kernel update policy like security updates in contrast to the stable/discrete model for applications
[07:54:43] *** Quits: klerk (~omg@user/klerk) (Remote host closed the connection)
[07:55:20] <Bashing-om> alzgh: In a sense yeah - LTS releases have that ability to install the next release's kernel - supporting newer hardware.

[07:58:45] <alzgh> Linux chad kernel update without even logging off, windows needs restart after every crap app install/uninstall
[07:59:10] <Bashing-om> alzgh: Me I run on old hardware - hense I have no desire for the HWE kernel - me likes tested and stable !

[08:01:23] <alzgh> Maybe it would be for the best to remove it or replace with a dummy or bump it up to 14 at least.
[08:01:26] <Bashing-om> alzgh: ' ls -al /var/run/reboot-required ' to *KNOW* if your system as set up needs rebooting.
[08:01:58] <Bashing-om> !latest | alzgh
[08:01:58] <ubottu> alzgh: Packages in Ubuntu may not be the latest. Ubuntu aims for stability, so "latest" may not be a good idea. Post-release updates are only considered if they are fixes for security vulnerabilities, high impact bug fixes, or unintrusive bug fixes with substantial benefit. See also !backports, !sru, and !ppa.
[08:02:08] <alzgh> wouldn't apt remind me if it needed? Bashing-om

[08:03:08] <Bashing-om> alzgh: I run so stripped down - I do not recall if apt has a reminder for reboot.
[08:04:56] <alzgh> ubottu I agree. These things should be handled through third party repositories. Are `!backports, !sru, and !ppa` branches on repository or how do I access them? Sorry for my ignorance.
[08:06:31] <Bashing-om> alzgh: Not to know is not a sin - we were all new at one time - in your client run ' /msg ubootu !backports ' to get a start on these learning curves.
[08:08:35] <alzgh> Bashing-om what do I see for output of `ls -al /var/run/reboot-required ` when it needs rebooting? This is my output right now `-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 32 Jun 23 05:27 /var/run/reboot-required`
[08:11:03] <Bashing-om> alzgh: As the file exist - then yeah need to reboot the system. else there would be no return. ( now there is a procedure to avoid the needed reboot, but I rather just reboot and see what happens personally).

[14:23:33] <akik> can i mount the target filesystems before starting the installer?
[14:24:51] <mgedmin> this is a good question; I know that a long time ago the desktop installer supported this use case: mount an existing partition, wipe everything except /home, install new OS there
[14:25:20] <mgedmin> you had to do manual partitioning and uncheck the 'format' checkbox, iirc
[14:25:23] <mgedmin> I've never tried it myself
[14:25:43] <akik> i remember that for luks i did something similar but can't remember it

[14:51:22] <clarkk> Ubuntu 20.04, Gnome 3.36.8.  For about a month, possibly after installing some updates, although there were no user config changes as far as I know, the USB external mouse drag and drop of my laptop has become very unreliable, although the trackpad works as expected. It seems to deactivate the left mouse click randomly, which means that the wrong things get highlighted.  This system, and the mouse, worked fine running
[14:51:22] <clarkk> 18.04 for years before I installed 20.04, and then worked fine for many months on 20.04.  Does anyone have any ideas about how I could fix it? I tried closing all software and apps that are running, but it still happens. I need the external mouse for some software I use (the issue occurs regardless of whether that software is running), and this issue is generally making the whole system unusable.

[16:46:22] <FreeBDSM> hi. Unfortunately, I'm using sublime text as a snap. Recently snapd pulled a new version of that package and decided to switch to it. I don't like the new version and would like to remain on older version. I did `sudo snap revert sublime-text --revision 97` to switch to the older version, but now I am worried that as soon as snapd will pull an even newer version - it will again automatically switch me to that version AND will delete the
[16:46:22] <FreeBDSM> older version due to system.refresh.retain=2. How to tell snapd to 'freeze' on this specific version forever and stop even checking for updates for it?
[16:48:06] <ogra> you cant ...

[16:48:38] <ogra> you can delay it for max 60 days but eventually snapd will enforce the upgrade so you dont stay on a potentially insecure version

[17:19:33] <rbasak> With git-ubuntu keeping a snapd repo up-to-date, I think it might be possible to use a Launchpad build recipe to do that automatically in a PPA for you now.
[17:19:37] <ogra> initial install with --dangerous (or the more dangerous !! --devmode) alsways disables refreshes
[17:19:41] <rbasak> I've not got round to looking into that.
[17:19:45] <akik> oh right so it's the --dangerous option that does it

[18:59:41] *** Joins: jw_ (~njw@58.182.164.99)
[19:04:08] <rbasak> I think, for /etc/openvpn/foo.conf, you can do "sudo systemctl enable openvpn@foo" and that's the simplest and most straightforward way of doing it. I've not tested this though (I run mine on demand, manually, rather than at startup).

[19:05:19] <rbasak> I'm guessing that's a change upstream made after the packaging in Debian was originally written, but I'm not sure.
