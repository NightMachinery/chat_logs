[13:44:41] <ciphrCat> DebXWoody: My gpg version is 2.2.27, and yes it works from the commandline.  That is, I’ve configured many keys to one email address using the «group» parameter, and when I run gpg with “-r email@address” I'm asked for each key if I want to include that key.  So GPG does the correct thing even in my pre-2.3 version.
[13:44:55] <ciphrCat> btw, sorry for the late reply.. i don't get on here often
[13:46:23] <ciphrCat> in any case, neomutt is the problem.. even though GPG has the capability neomutt does not leverage it. In principle Neomutt should not be asking the user which key to encrypt to if gpg knows the answer.
[13:47:19] *** Quits: rossyrg_ (~rossyrg@cordelia.uberspace.de) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[13:47:59] <ciphrCat> but i also suspect it would be hard to code that smartly.  Neomutt would have to do a mock encryption with GPG in the background and possibly come back to the user for input and then possibly re-do the crypto.. and the back and forth would be complicated to code.
[13:49:58] <ciphrCat> But even failing that, Neomutt could still be smarter.  Instead of asking the user “which key?”, Neomutt could ask the user “which keyS?” (plural) and not necessarily expect a one-to-one mapping between addressees and keys.

[14:29:52] *** Joins: feliix42 (~felix@gibbs.uberspace.de)
[14:35:35] <ciphrCat> the developer is wrong. I tested it.  gpg 2.2.27 already does the right thing and applies the /group/ parameter correctly. It's purely down to neomutt to either query/test an address with gpg, or at least give the user a way to bypass the prompt for which key to choose and defer to gpg
[14:36:26] <ciphrCat> i don't mean to rush anyone, but just making it clear that there's nothing to wait for on the part of gpg
[14:50:35] <DebXWoody> ciphrCat: You checked with the command line? right? Yes, this is working. I do not know the neomutt codebase, but when I remember well, neomutt will use gpgme. My question to werner was, is it possible to use the groups with gpgme. Is may not the case of < 2.3.

[17:08:18] <ciphrCat> flatcap: AFAIK, mutt has never had the ability to apply more keys than addresses. It’s perhaps a rare need. It’s for the case when many individuals at a company each have a PGP key, but you only want to address a general/shared inbox like “sales@xyzcorp”

[17:09:35] <ciphrCat> I did not try multiple crypt-hooks for the same pattern.. but I suspect mutt would just use either the first matching hook or the last matching hook, but not all.
[17:12:28] <ciphrCat> Possible hack: use a BCC header like: “bogus@address1, bogus@address2, bogus@address..” Mutt would likely prompt for a PGP key for each bogus BCC address and thus give an opportunity to encrypt to many keys.  The “To:” address would be the only successful delivery, but it would be encrypted to all keys.
