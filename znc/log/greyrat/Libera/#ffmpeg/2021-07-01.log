[01:39:55] <MarioMey> Hello, there. Why I can't create a h264_vaapi in a MKV container?
[01:40:06] <MarioMey> MP4 works.
[01:40:29] <sfan5> surely ffmpeg prints an error or something
[01:43:02] *** Quits: Hello71 (~Hello71@wireguard/contributor/hello71) (Quit: Hello71)
[01:43:47] <MarioMey> [h264_vaapi @ 0x55aa1d2a2480] Driver does not support some wanted packed headers (wanted 0xd, found 0).
[01:43:52] <MarioMey> [h264_vaapi @ 0x55aa1d2a2480] Driver does not support packed sequence headers, but a global header is requested.
[01:43:57] <MarioMey> [h264_vaapi @ 0x55aa1d2a2480] No global header will be written: this may result in a stream which is not usable for some purposes (e.g. not muxable to some containers).

[01:44:09] <MarioMey> Error initializing output stream 0:0 --
[01:44:24] <MarioMey> Sorry the multiline. This is the error.
[01:44:42] <JEEB> means that your libva driver's encoder doesn't support putting the decoder initialization data in the mp4/mkv way
[01:44:43] <MarioMey> I thought that VAAPI couldn't be encoded into a MKV... but OBS does it.
[01:45:10] <JEEB> I think there's a bit stream filter which might convert in-band to out of band

[01:46:03] <JEEB> yup, I think the extract_extradata bsf might help

[01:46:40] <MarioMey> JEEB: this is for me?
[01:46:49] <JEEB> also if I recall correctly the drivers that don't support packed headers were AMD, I wonder if I guessed correctly :P

[01:50:38] <JEEB> also for the record, if you are not doing any filtering to the video, if you just set -hwaccel_output_format vaapi it will hwdecode and keep it on the GPU
[01:50:57] <JEEB> oh wait, you're not doing -hwaccel
[01:51:07] <JEEB> I just got confuzzled by the -vaapi_device :)

[01:57:56] <JEEB> and I guessed right, it was AMD :)
[01:58:12] <MarioMey> VAAPI isn't only for AMD?
[01:58:15] <JEEB> nope
[01:58:20] <JEEB> intel is the one that came up with it
[01:58:21] <MarioMey> Oh.
[01:58:25] <JEEB> it's like vdpau
[01:58:41] <JEEB> you have the library, and then it loads a driver
[01:58:47] <JEEB> the driver is the one that talks with hardware
[01:59:00] <JEEB> here you can see the radeonsi driver getting loaded in the log
[02:00:22] <blerd> I'm still not sure how to use the fps filter with avfilter_graph_parse2. I only get -11 and then 1 frame at the very end.

[16:12:09] <ripdog> hi all. is there a way for ffmpeg to split an ogg/opus internet radio stream based on the embedded tags? When I'm playing it, my music player can display notifications on song change, so the data is definitely there.
[16:12:35] <pedalo> that would be pretty cool, lemme look at the doc
[16:12:59] <JEEB> I don't think there's a function for that in the ffmpeg.c API client, but definitely doable if you can actually receive the tags within libavformat
[16:13:06] *** Joins: bencc1 (~bencc1@5.29.61.245)
[16:14:30] <JEEB> (depends on which level you want to do it, if you don't want to get the ogg stream demultiplexed at all then you'd basically have to implement the minimal parsing yourself - since libavformat parses the included packets itself and thus you don't get just a simple binary cut at that point :P )
[16:15:55] <ripdog> hmm. I guess if timestamps were discovered with a simple libavformat-based program, a seperate opus splitter could do the splitting after the fact? there's no need to do this in realtime
[16:16:26] <ripdog> that said, if I'm gonna have to break into C to do this it's probably beyond my level of caring :)
[16:20:18] <JEEB> it really depends on whether you want to just cut (and not overwrite the original ogg mux), or you're OK with lavf reading the packets out and then writing out the segments with its own muxer :)
[16:20:58] <JEEB> I mean, if I recall correctly it might just be concatenated ogg files with the updated metadata :P
[16:21:18] <JEEB> so in that sense if that is the case, you should be able to find the start point
[16:21:22] <JEEB> (of an ogg document)

[18:43:40] <SpeakerToMeat> Question, I have a source with 1 video stream, and 2 audio streams. say, if I want to choose a single audio stream, if I do something like "-i something.mkv -map 0:a:0" then no video stream will pass unless I specify it, right?

[19:41:26] <SpeakerToMeat> If I'm outputing 4 resolutions at once via multiple -f and with multiple -vf and want to burn subtitles, do I need to add the subtitles to each resolution's -vf or can I establish a global -vf for it before it all?
[19:42:10] <c_14> you can create a -filter_complex which uses the subtitle filter and then split filters to create 4 outputs, then map those for each output file
[19:43:13] <SpeakerToMeat> Now I wonder if there's more degradation if I burn first and resize later, rather than resize and burn later
[19:43:25] <SpeakerToMeat> on the subtitle image/quality
[19:44:17] <c_14> image quality shouldn't be affected, quality on the text might though
[19:45:13] <SpeakerToMeat> Yes I mean legibility
[19:45:23] <SpeakerToMeat> I think sacrifice of time aside it's better to resize then burn
[19:45:28] <SpeakerToMeat> but I'll do a couple tests to see

[23:32:40] <JEEB> on windows I think compat/w32pthreads.h's wrapper is being generally utilized (implements a pthreads API around windows threads)
[23:32:51] <JEEB> so depending on what your clang has, it might be skipping that. dunno
[23:33:15] <byte4byte> thats where the problem was
[23:33:22] *** Joins: admal (~admal@gateway/tor-sasl/admal)
[23:33:34] <byte4byte> looks like its just emulating pthreads so i guess it should be fine
[23:33:37] <byte4byte> with the definition
[23:33:38] <JEEB> yes. but...
[23:33:42] <JEEB> it should come out of windows :D
[23:34:42] <JEEB> esp. if you see that in FFmpeg `git grep -i timespec` does not find you a definition
[23:34:48] <JEEB> and since MSVC can build it :D
[23:35:58] <byte4byte> the only place i see it using it is struct timespec tv = { .tv_sec  =  t / 1000000,
[23:35:58] <byte4byte>                                        .tv_nsec = (t % 1000000) * 1000 };
[23:35:58] <byte4byte>                 int err = pthread_cond_timedwait(&s->cond, &s->mutex, &tv);
[23:36:06] <JEEB> yea I can see the definition in my Windows SDK
[23:36:08] <byte4byte> it looks like it fills out the informations itself
[23:36:57] <JEEB> I have the current windows 10 SDK and the latest "server" SDK (because it finally contains certain AV1 structures in a stable way)
[23:37:25] <JEEB> yup
[23:37:30] <JEEB> timespec only gets hidden if
[23:37:46] <JEEB> _CRT_NO_TIME_T is not defined
[23:38:32] <JEEB> yea both 10.0.19041.0 and 10.0.20348.0 have it there in time.h
[23:39:43] <JEEB> I mean, it gets defined if _CRT_NO_TIME_T is not defined :P
[23:39:53] <JEEB> but I feel like you're utilizing some other time.h ?
[23:40:35] <byte4byte> ok maybe thats begin defined somewhere
[23:40:44] <byte4byte> I am using ninja
[23:41:24] <JEEB> dunno, I just know that FFmpeg's own build system works JustFine with MSVC, and the MSVC clang should be utilizing the same SDK :P
[23:42:08] <BtbN> I don't think clang supports mingw
[23:42:12] <BtbN> or the other way around
[23:42:47] <JEEB> wbs has made it work with mingw
[23:42:53] <JEEB> https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw
[23:43:08] <JEEB> and MSVC now has its own packaged clang
[23:43:28] <JEEB> '
[23:43:30] <JEEB> > Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Tools\Llvm\x64\bin
[23:43:40] <JEEB> and that should be utilizing the MS SDK
[23:43:48] <JEEB> where time.h should have the definition of timespec

[23:44:43] <JEEB> so either our configure/build system doesn't support MSVC clang, or the user is not utilizing the configure/build system in the correct manner
