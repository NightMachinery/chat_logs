[11:16:19] <colo> one of my domains ended up in the rspamd.com URI BL (no deliverability problems so far, but preemptive checking via valli.org alerted me). does anyone to you happen to know what's that BL's deal, and what might be a reason to end up there?
[11:16:45] <colo> the domain is very low volume for email and 100% innocent in terms of any HTTP(S)-available content...
[11:43:53] <tuxick> i didn't know rspamd runs a bl

[17:00:53] <dminuoso> How long before you remove an old, non-compromised, no longer used DKIM key from DNS?
[17:03:18] <tuxick> any reason to?
[17:08:43] <colo> Khepra, tuxick - removal worked :)
[17:08:52] <Khepra>  \o/
[17:09:57] <dminuoso> tuxick: The same reason you do key rotation in the first place?
[17:10:23] <dminuoso> It's just good hygiene in case keys do get compromised for quirky reasons.
[17:12:23] <tuxick> sure, but i can't think of any key that might have an even lower priority in my agenda
[17:14:13] <dminuoso> Anyway. The DKIM RFC only says the old key "be retained for a reasonable validation interval"
[17:14:17] <dminuoso> But what is reasonable?
[17:14:34] <dminuoso> A week minimum, as that's usually the maximum queue life time 
[17:14:40] <dminuoso> Of most MTAs anyway
[17:15:01] <dminuoso> Maybe a month? That way the occasinoal hold or poorly configured MTA wont hinder receptivity of my mail
[17:41:57] <tuxick> week sounds enough to me
