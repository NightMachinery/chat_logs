[10:39:13] <kwilczynski> egy: Interesting question!
[10:40:51] <kwilczynski> egy: I am not sure how the runtime you have does it, as it might be implementation specific, but generally, namespaces are inherited from the top process, so in other words, everything inside that fork()/vfork() will inherit it's parents namespaces.
[10:44:25] <kwilczynski> egy: If you think about this, this makes a whole lot of sense form security and resource sharing point of view.
[10:45:03] <kwilczynski> egy: There is also a whole concept o sharing a namespace (multiple containers in a Pod anyone?) and which namespace it is - PID is somewhat special, so is mount, etc.
[10:45:49] <kwilczynski> egy: Kubernetes is an interesting thing specimen here, as it does some cheeky things to ensure that namespaces work and are shared.

[22:04:18] <slaughter> Yeah he's been trying but his current company did some restructuring or something and closed off those opportunities
[22:04:33] <Joel> land a jr dev gig, and they should make it well known they want to learn/help with all things ci/cd to start
[22:04:54] <slaughter> He's just trying to get out of support engineer roles, been applying for a ton of entry/jr dev and devops jobs
[22:05:01] <slaughter> The market is weird for juniors right now I guess
[22:05:33] <Joel> Got a previous co he has good standing with he can go back to for an entry level role?
[22:07:23] <slaughter> Not really, a lot of his recent work was through contractors (IE for Google) so his paths there didn't exist in the first place
[22:07:31] <slaughter> He's tried for sure but no dice
[22:07:45] <Joel> :(
[22:07:47] <slaughter> Any time he gets any bites they just want him back in support roles
[22:07:56] <Joel> support is the worst :D

[22:34:41] <slaughter> I've seen it before yeah, pretty good resource
[22:36:02] <lantech19446> ok, I know a lot of people in dev careers recommend it. There is an overwhelming amount of stuff to learn if I want to get into devops and honestly I don't trust my experience in networking to be enough because none of it is at the enterprise level but I wonder how much of that I need to know for a jr role
[22:36:37] *** Joins: Colt (~Colt@user/colt)
[22:39:39] <slaughter> I wouldn't sweat that
[22:41:51] <slaughter> Not that it's not important, but the basics of DNS and SSL are probably enough up front. Any networking stuff you do is likely to be in some specific system (IE AWS) anyway, so basics is generally sufficient
[22:44:28] <lantech19446> I just feel like I have no real direction I tried to learn coding so many times but my brain wasn't functional and now that it is I have goals and I'm learning again but I don't know what to learn I don't know whether I should go for webdev devops or programming everyone has different opinions and different views on what's needed. All I know is webdev seems like it's going to be exceedingly hard to
[22:44:30] <lantech19446> get into and won't pay very well for a few years. I'm thinking devops may be the better course of action right now I'm learning javascript and I plan on going to node afterwards but I guess I should learn some other language too
[22:45:30] <rawtaz> honestly, the key thing to actually becoming a devops experienced person is to get a job somewhere there's devops and work it up from there. even if you kknow the theory, you have nothing much to show if you havent got real world experience
[22:46:56] <slaughter> Agreed ^
[22:47:36] <lantech19446> hey rawtaz I recognize you from some other channels too, do you think I can get a devops position without knowing a language?
[22:47:38] <slaughter> Though sounds like your sysadmin experience isn't exactly minor so you're already probably pretty well versed in the ops side of things. 
[22:48:49] <lantech19446> yes and no this is a very small network so small that i've never touched a router or an enterprise firewall or ran multiple switches or done active directory on an enterprise level etc that's part of why i'm so overwhelmed
[22:49:09] <rawtaz> lantech19446: i think so yeah, just got to find the right spot :)
[22:49:20] <slaughter> I've never done any of that either, and hope to god I never will
[22:49:38] <lantech19446> are you on the dev side?
[22:51:47] <slaughter> Nope, I haven't written anything more than scripts in this role
[22:52:09] <slaughter> I'm also not working in an enterprise level org, though. 
[22:52:44] <lantech19446> interesting, I didn't know devops existed outside of the enterprise sphere, maybe there's hope for me yet
[22:53:11] <slaughter> But AFAIK in an enterprise sized org most of that stuff is going to have a dedicated networking team anyway. If you have on-prem at that size you need dedicated support for that stuff
[22:53:32] <slaughter> Oh yeah devops is everywhere. And if it isn't, all the better because you can make it happen :)
[22:55:23] <slaughter> That's pretty much how I got into it - worked at a company that didn't have any devops but was growing the scope of projects and entering into the cloud at quite a clip. Slowly started making myself the "devops person" and eventually got to choose my title
[22:56:23] <lantech19446> nice
[22:59:35] <lantech19446> well that makes me feel better about my prospects
[23:00:42] <rawtaz> honestly i think every seasoned technicial or sysadmin should know how to program, but i understand if not everyone has had the time or opportunity to get into it
[23:01:19] <rawtaz> i'd feel terribly limited if i didnt know how to write code. but then again if i had like a plain server managing role that didnt even require scripting it might work find

[23:01:57] <lantech19446> I literally couldn't learn I've had untreated depression and bipolar for 30yrs and I'm finally on meds that work but it's like a light switch in the brain because untreated major depression causes brain damage while you're experiencing it
[23:03:05] <rawtaz> lantech19446: i see, then you have a good reason for not having dabbled with it, and theres no need to feel stressed out by it. there's plenty of work that doesnt require programming, and foremost theres a lot of people who dont know it and still do operations related stuff :)
[23:04:51] <lantech19446> well the kind of funny thing is every time I was manic I decided I was going to try to learn to code so somewhere inside I knew I wanted to do something with code it just never lasted longer than a few hours to a few days but now I'm learning, right now i'm doing javascript because my original idea was webdev but I can always learn node after my js course and translate that into server side
[23:04:53] <lantech19446> language
[23:05:21] <rawtaz> i see yeah
[23:05:42] <rawtaz> the problem is that theres sooooooo many things out there in every field, that it can be hard to know what to go for and learn about
[23:06:35] <lantech19446> yep and that's where I keep winding up with all these options
[23:07:21] <rawtaz> what do you want to work with/do?
[23:08:50] <lantech19446> I think I'd enjoy learning cloud, I'm not sure which one I want to learn though
[23:11:32] <rawtaz> i guess all of the current ones will stay for a looong time, so it's mostly a matter if being a linux/aws person, a windows/azure person *shivers* or a google person
[23:12:22] <rawtaz> personally im not a fan of microsoft stuff and the little ive used azure ive mostly been frustrated over its lack of UX and that its buggy and stuff, and im not keen on google so for me i'd go AWS
[23:12:33] <rawtaz> all of them have their pros and cons, like everything else in this world
[23:13:13] <lantech19446> my biggest issue with aws has been that I have no comprehension of how their billing works or what the different services are etc
[23:13:38] <rawtaz> noone else does either
[23:13:52] <kubblai> a colleague suggested to me something good. login to the aws console every lunchtime and read for 10 mins about one of the services
[23:14:16] <rawtaz> their difference services are huge, i think they have like 180+ services, but you'd just focus on the common ones, read and understand what they are about in general, and then fiddle around with the ones that seem relevant to what youre pursuing
[23:14:23] <lantech19446> rawtaz: well I'm glad i'm not the only one I know a couple people who seem to get it but i guess they're the outliers
[23:14:26] <rawtaz> kubblai: nice idea!!
[23:14:44] <lantech19446> yea that does sound good
[23:14:50] <rawtaz> lantech19446: theres consultants whos only business is helping people get their services billing right
[23:16:04] <lantech19446> well damn
[23:16:32] <lantech19446> so I guess the question now is can I learn two things at once
[23:19:10] <slaughter> Corey Quinn's podcasts (Screaming in the Cloud and AWS Morning Brief) are a good way to get some info. The morning brief episodes are never more than like 10 or 15 minutes 
[23:19:45] <lantech19446> ok I'll look for them in a minute
[23:21:57] <lantech19446> ok gottem both
[23:26:03] <rawtaz> lantech19446: hey, dont stress it :) take your time and learn what you feel you are interested in learning at the moment
[23:26:37] <rawtaz> there will *always* be many more things you could start learning, but trying to do more than you have energy or time or anything else for at the moment is anything but constructive.
[23:28:07] <lantech19446> like I said learning is a whole new thing for me so I literally don't know what my brain is capable of until I try. My goal is to have a new job within a year though so my wife can stop working two jobs. Right now I have awesome health benefits they keep us both sane and alive but my pay sucks so my next job needs to be a significantly higher pay rate enough that we can live and buy that level of
[23:28:09] <lantech19446> health insurance
[23:42:40] <rawtaz> i see. i guess you're in the states?
[23:43:20] <rawtaz> under those circumstances i would target something that is as close to what i already know, perhaps with some new element where i can learn as little as possible to increase my skills as much as possible.
[23:43:29] <rawtaz> in other words, keep it simple.
[23:47:22] <lantech19446> yep in the states and yea that was my original thought but most of those jobs pay what i'm already making
[23:50:06] <rawtaz> what are you doing now then?
[23:50:20] <lantech19446> I'm a sys admin for a small public library
[23:50:31] <Joel> lantech19446 re aws billing, entire companies sell products to help people comprehend them
