[13:44:48] <iamak[m]> AryaK[m]: How did the laptop survive? xD
[13:44:59] <AryaK[m]>  its always really hot
[13:45:06] <AryaK[m]> probably due to bad power management
[13:45:08] <AryaK[m]> on nouveasu
[13:45:13] <iamak[m]> AryaK[m]: BSD only?
[13:45:18] <AryaK[m]> no i use void
[13:45:26] <iamak[m]> Ah
[13:45:27] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> Intel i5-8250U
[13:45:30] <AryaK[m]> i will try freebsd soon tho
[13:45:32] <iamak[m]> Arch for me hasn't failed yet
[13:45:49] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> freebsd was a pain to get xorg working ngl
[13:45:57] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> openbsd more straight forward lmao
[13:46:11] <iamak[m]> I can even emulate BOTW, play Apex (30 fps tho) and CSGO on this Intel HD 620 Graphics
[13:46:12] <iamak[m]> xD
[13:46:27] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> Lol nice
[13:46:32] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> le optimized kernel heckerino
[13:46:53] <AryaK[m]> i played CSGO on i3 6006U
[13:47:01] <iamak[m]> I think it's just no trash overhead like Windows
[13:47:03] <iamak[m]> AryaK[m]: FPS?
[13:47:13] <iamak[m]> I get stable ~50
[13:47:16] <AryaK[m]> idk
[13:47:17] <AryaK[m]> i dont use the pc anymopre
[13:47:21] <iamak[m]> Lol
[13:47:24] <AryaK[m]> its now a server
[13:47:42] <iamak[m]> iamak[m]: On Windows same laptop I used to get 20 barely
[13:47:51] <AryaK[m]> oof
[13:48:13] <iamak[m]> Arch spoiled me tho. I started hating other OS-es due to how non minimal and locked they are
[13:48:14] <iamak[m]> xD
[13:48:23] <AryaK[m]> lol
[13:48:26] <AryaK[m]> try void
[13:48:38] <iamak[m]> Void is arch based no?
[13:48:52] <AryaK[m]> no
[13:48:54] <AryaK[m]> its independent
[13:49:01] <iamak[m]> Achha
[13:49:18] <iamak[m]> I thought it was Arch based coz one time they used inverted Arch logo as April fool joke
[13:49:26] <iamak[m]> AryaK[m]: It's also minimal?
[13:49:45] <iamak[m]> Recommend me a VM I will try void now
[13:50:07] <AryaK[m]> very minimal
[13:50:20] <AryaK[m]> iamak[m]: recommend VM?
[13:50:28] <AryaK[m]> i use quickemu and virt-manager usually
[13:50:32] <iamak[m]> Idk any VM software for Linux ;_;
[13:50:41] <iamak[m]> AryaK[m]: Ah ok. Easy to use?
[13:50:45] <AryaK[m]> yeah
[13:51:06] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> iamak[m]: just kvm lol
[13:51:11] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> virt-manager is just a gateway to libvirt
[13:51:20] <iamak[m]> Hmm
[13:51:25] <AryaK[m]> yeah
[13:51:30] <AryaK[m]> but its more user friendly
[13:51:33] <AryaK[m]> cockpit is another option 
[13:51:35] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> yeah
[13:51:38] <iamak[m]> So if I use QuickEMU I will need virt manager?
[13:51:39] <AryaK[m]> its web based libvirt frontent
[13:51:43] <iamak[m]> Or it's independent?
[13:51:47] <AryaK[m]> iamak[m]: quickemu is nice cli
[13:51:53] <iamak[m]> s/manager/manage/livert/
[13:51:55] <AryaK[m]> which uses libvirt + qemu
[13:52:01] <iamak[m]> Ah
[13:52:06] <AryaK[m]> virt-manager and cockpit are both develioped by redhate
[13:52:06] <iamak[m]> So it has it built in?
[13:52:12] <AryaK[m]> and use libvirt +qemu
[13:52:19] <iamak[m]> > redhate
[13:52:19] <iamak[m]> lol
[13:52:29] <AryaK[m]> tho the former is gtk and latter is web based
[13:52:32] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> lol
[13:52:35] <iamak[m]> Hmm
[13:52:49] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> imma gonna install arch on this laptop probably
[13:52:58] <iamak[m]> I will try quickemu coz I am halfway there
[13:53:18] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> u can play half life 1 on openbsd cuz of xash3d port

[18:24:38] <NeoVoid[m]> any idea what i am doing wrong
[18:24:51] <NeoVoid[m]> aryak i think you must have some ideas about it
[18:25:08] <NeoVoid[m]> as you play with hosting and servers all the time
[18:25:13] <labrador> NeoVoid[m], you need a webserver too...
[18:25:44] <labrador> How does /var/www/html get to port 80(not 8080) without a server serving it
[18:25:46] <NeoVoid[m]> labrador: i had installed apache
[18:26:38] <gtlsgamr> is apache service enabled?
[18:26:54] <gtlsgamr> sudo systemctl status apache*** something service
[18:26:54] <labrador> Is it running and configured to serve /var/www/html/random.html at say localhost:80/random
[18:27:17] <labrador> It can't know what you want it to do on its own NeoVoid[m] 
[18:27:21] <NeoVoid[m]> labrador: ok i doubt first that the guy was telling me this had some kind of httpd server already enabled inside his redhat system but i struggled in my arch/artix to do that a while
[18:27:53] <labrador> oof artix...maybe do arch cuz most peeps don't know how to operate openrc
[18:28:01] <labrador> It'll be easier to get help
[18:31:01] <NeoVoid[m]> i am not sure about apache but when i installed and started its service its shows in btop as httpd
[18:31:27] <iamak[m]> I have verifed my element session atleast 4 times but it still shows unverified. Any idea how to fix this?
[18:31:36] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> bro wtf
[18:31:39] <iamak[m]> NeoVoid[m]: httpd is the apache service afaik
[18:31:40] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> how did they ban eric raymond

[18:31:47] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> so retarded
[18:32:08] <NeoVoid[m]> iamak[m]: yeah thats what i am guessing
[18:32:23] <NeoVoid[m]> actually yep you are right
[18:32:34] <NeoVoid[m]> i installed apache to get httpd running i forget

[18:34:38] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> he made the movement
[18:34:43] <NeoVoid[m]> ohh
[18:34:55] <labrador> Raymond has claimed that "Gays experimented with unfettered promiscuity in the 1970s and got AIDS as a consequence", and that "Police who react to a random black male behaving suspiciously who might be in the critical age range as though he is an near-imminent lethal threat, are being rational, not racist."
[18:35:02] <labrador> I think he isn't that cool NeoVoid[m] 
[18:35:22] <labrador> I have read cathedral and the bazaar tho,seemed cool but ig not
[18:35:34] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i mean the gay stuff does give aids and hiv tho
[18:35:47] <NeoVoid[m]> labrador: raymond or rms?
[18:35:56] <labrador> ElJohnSepiol[m], not really. Heterosexual sex can give you hiv too...depends on who you fuck tbh
[18:36:11] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> but there is a lot more higher chance with the gay sex
[18:36:23] <NeoVoid[m]> ElJohnSepiol[m]: dude this video is two years ago Mar 3, 2020
[18:36:25] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> and iirc most of the gays have hiv and aids but back on topic

[18:40:28] <iamak[m]> RMS had some sexual harrassment scandal na?
[18:40:38] <iamak[m]> That's why people are anti-rms
[18:40:59] <iamak[m]> I don't think Linus Torvalds was in any scandals or stuff like that
[18:41:01] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> the free as in freespeech and freedom should be TRUE
[18:41:01] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> not a fork a of freespeech and freedom :skull:
[18:41:17] <labrador> torvalds is more of a normal guy
[18:41:17] <iamak[m]> iamak[m]: So he can't be removed
[18:41:22] <labrador> kinda like us
[18:41:24] <iamak[m]> Tbh I like Torvalds more than RMS
[18:41:30] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> torvalds is the average boomer with a family
[18:41:40] <iamak[m]> RMS always seemed like that old guy who was too set in his ways
[18:41:42] <labrador> rms is more of an autistic genius savan
[18:41:44] <labrador> t
[18:41:56] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> sed
[18:41:57] <iamak[m]> Idk what savant means lol
[18:42:02] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> he did make pedo remarks so its ok for him to be out
[18:42:27] <AryanPandey[m]> I still cant understand rms philosophy
[18:42:34] <labrador> iamak[m], autistic savants are people extremely good at one thing
[18:42:46] <iamak[m]> But I never liked that RMS always cancelled HURD developement and started from scratch (or something like that) because he wanted it to be perfect
[18:42:50] <labrador> and dysfunctional everywhere else

[18:43:44] <Tor[m]> iamak[m]: Ak is kidding
[18:44:05] <iamak[m]> I am not denying the GNU coreutils are a majot part of Linux but I dislike his philosophy or sth (idk how to explain)

[18:45:00] <iamak[m]> I am not denying the FSF work
[18:45:08] <iamak[m]> Tor[m]: Haan lol
[18:45:46] <iamak[m]> What I meant was that if the creator of the OS wants to call it that, he is free to. RMS can't force him to call it something else just because he used free software published by RMS's organization

[18:47:48] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> lol no he got removed
[18:48:20] <iamak[m]> I can understand that. FSF should not get caught in any scandal because RMS made disgusting pedo remarks, was caught in sexual harrassment scandal etc
[18:48:23] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> also why does that one guy think bsd is not based and everyone should use gnu approved distro Hmmmm

[19:30:16] <NeoVoid[m]> iamak[m]: we understand better in mother tounge than other tounge lol
[19:30:28] <NeoVoid[m]> its a instict.
[19:30:42] <iamak[m]> Yes
[19:31:19] <iamak[m]> I think this is an unpopular opinion but not being to study in mother tongue in schools is a very bad thing
[19:34:02] <iamak[m]> Can someone tldr what dbus is?
[19:36:25] <NeoVoid[m]> <iamak[m]> "I think this is an unpopular..." <- yes you are right. childrens these days like britishers but dont know what the word is spoken in his mother toung or hindi
[19:37:12] <NeoVoid[m]> iamak[m]: i think its like framework to help different programs communicate with each other kinda thing
[19:37:30] <iamak[m]> So like IPC kind of thing
[19:37:32] <iamak[m]> * of thing?
[19:37:34] <NeoVoid[m]> NeoVoid[m]: thanks to new education policy they changed this
[19:47:18] <labrador> iamak[m], dbus is a format for IPC except it makes it easy to get a lot of programs to co-ordinate at once without your own special ipc format
[19:47:21] <labrador> Its quite cool

[19:47:46] <labrador> also >tounge
[19:47:52] * labrador facepalms
[19:48:52] <labrador> eh iamak[m] it actually helps because guess what...college won't let you study in your own special language.
[19:49:07] <labrador> It will be in english and the better you're at it,the easier it will be to study.
[19:51:01] <iamak[m]> Not really. My parents both studied in mother tongue. In college they had an English class that's it. Neither faced any issues
[19:51:23] <labrador> iamak[m], they won't be as fluent in english as one who studied in a convent school
[19:51:34] <labrador> There really is no replacement to 10 years of practice
[19:51:53] <iamak[m]> Who cares about fluency? You only need to understand and convey what you want to speak🙂
[19:52:13] <labrador> iamak[m], you need fluency to not look uncouth
[19:52:26] <iamak[m]> Uncouth?
[19:52:31] <labrador> Also you start speaking stuff like "tounge" without fluency
[19:52:33] <labrador> lol
[19:52:54] <iamak[m]> Achha lol
[19:53:09] <iamak[m]> labrador: Idc
[19:53:15] <iamak[m]> My boss speaks worse English than me
[19:53:16] <iamak[m]> :p
[19:53:34] <iamak[m]> And I work in a US MNC
[19:54:06] <iamak[m]> Atleast at my workplace no one cares about English quality
[19:54:24] <labrador> iamak[m], well the MNC is really there for the cheap labour. I don't think they particularly care about how good the workers are
[19:54:29] <labrador> I've heard a lot of stories
[19:55:26] <labrador> About the american depts of these MNCs needing to clean up what gets done in india over a far greater amount of time than if they just did it themselves
[20:05:56] <labrador> Like look at me,my english isn't perfect but its not bad either. Certainly not as bad as most of our youth.
[20:06:14] <labrador> This is the result of a convent school iamak[m]

[21:05:05] <gtlsgamr> labrador: iamak[m]: My boss has 19 years of experience in my field. His salary is nearly 5 times mine. And his english is utter shit.
[21:05:09] <gtlsgamr> Just barely understandable
[21:05:25] <gtlsgamr> So english is bare minimum
[21:05:32] <gtlsgamr> fluency doesnt matter
[21:10:51] <iamak[m]> Exactly my point :)
[21:11:06] <iamak[m]> <Aaron[m]1> "When I pipe curl command to..." <- What is pup😅
[21:17:06] <mxbl> Aaron[m]1: curl -s probably
[21:17:13] <mxbl> iamak[m]: a json processor
[21:18:47] <iamak[m]> Ah ok
