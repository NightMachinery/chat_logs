[02:45:14] <kronk> Church: #lobsters
[02:45:25] <kronk> might wanna keep an eye on jordi.
[02:51:20] <kronk> is jordi like, 15 or something.
[02:51:29] <edk> kronk: you're mistaken. jordi knows what offtopic and ontopic means, and we're all just wrong
[02:51:34] <kronk> clearly.
[02:51:45] <kronk> then we should all start complaining about the ukraine war in #lobsters.
[02:51:57] <edk> moose: fwiw by techbros i mean the sorts of people who comment on this stuff on hn, not the people who are in that channel
[02:52:15] <kronk> ffs, it's worthy of discussion. hell, I left a comment. but it's not _on-topic_.
[02:52:17] <kronk> we aren't HN!
[02:52:27] <kronk> how thick does jordi have to be.
[02:52:36] <edk> no, but there are people who comment on Highly Engaging posts on the site that would turn us into HN
[02:53:07] <edk> there is a reason lobste.rs doesn't decide on a weekly basis that the answer to all political problems is eugenics
[02:53:09] <moose> edk: <3
[02:53:11] <moose> thanks for clarification
[02:53:15] <edk> and lovely as it would be that reason is not that we're better people
[02:53:25] <kronk> LMAO.
[02:54:44] <kronk> I wonder if technomancy regrets inviting him.
[02:55:36] <edk> well you don't need to be invited to the channel
[02:55:47] <Brekkjern> IIRC, pushcx said that with the removal of -boil, that the channel should be open for more somewhat off-topic stuff, as long as it's not political (lol)
[02:56:00] <kronk> he ain't exactly a breath of fresh air on the site either.
[02:56:10] <kronk> Brekkjern: -boil?
[02:56:14] <edk> it's much easier to ignore tedious people on the site
[02:56:35] <Brekkjern> kronk: The off-topic channel for #lobsters back on freenode when we were there
[02:56:37] <edk> the discussion threads thing is kinda parallel, you can just follow the discussions you find useful
[02:56:41] <kronk> aha.
[02:56:47] <kronk> edk: fair.
[02:57:01] <edk> on IRC the conversation is just in a place and if that's not a place you want to be at you don't join in
[02:57:36] <kronk> it's less of "not a place you want to be at" and more of "conversing with a person you don't want to"
[02:58:24] <edk> well, yeah, but i mean just /ignoring that person tends not to work if that person's opinion is the focal point of a give ndiscussion
[02:59:31] <kronk> yeh.
[03:16:40] <Church> kronk: Ugh was eating dinner. Lemme drop a comment in a few
[03:16:53] <kronk> np, I think it's largely defused.
[03:18:48] <Church> Yarp, I'll think whether dropping a comment will incite it further before doing so...

[07:07:44] <kronk> lmfao.
[07:07:51] <kronk> I see they're using my tech strategy.
[07:10:30] <companion_cube> what a coincidence, a russian soldier died on my doorstep with a KGB laptop
[07:10:54] <kronk> was it running gentoo.
[07:11:45] <wrl> can ukraine please retaliate like tomorrow with exactly the same stunt
[07:11:50] <wrl> but maybe an even shittier laptop
