[01:51:24] <manicennui> Terraform.
[01:51:28] <gerikson> oki
[01:51:47] <gerikson> today I made my second-to-last customer update using our tool
[01:52:04] <gerikson> part of it is writing the version + date to the DB
[01:52:59] <gerikson> some *idiot* decided to, instead of emitting SQL to set to time = SYSDATETIME()
[01:53:25] <gerikson> they crafted an SQL update with a date string generated from the user's locale
[01:53:57] <gerikson> said locale was FInnish, yyyy-mm-dd HH.MM.SS
[01:54:15] <gerikson> and the updated failed with a char to date conversion error
[01:54:28] <gerikson> setting the locale to use yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:DD resolved it
[01:54:30] <gerikson> ffs
[02:04:42] <Church> Good old terraform
[02:04:47] <Church> Not the best but it gets the job done.
[02:06:07] <manicennui> What is the best?
[02:07:18] <manicennui> gerikson: Ideally the column would hold timezone info, and you'd convert all dates to ISO 8601 before inserting.
[02:08:17] <manicennui> I prefer not to rely on database functions for setting time, because that means you must change the time on the database server if your test requires a different time to be inserted in some scenario, and it doesn't allow you to explicitly set a different time in cases where it makes sense.

[02:48:08] <prussian> Simple as that.
[02:48:29] <prussian> I should just start using TAI time and disregard all human values associated with time.
[02:50:54] <manicennui> Isn't time essentially a human value?
[02:51:29] <manicennui> Have we shown that any animals understand time?
[02:51:47] <gerikson> depends
[02:52:03] <gerikson> don't some dogs "know" when their owners are due to arrive home?
[02:53:51] <manicennui> Seems that way.
[02:54:28] <manicennui> https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2018-10-23/study-animals-can-tell-time
[02:54:37] <prussian> I mean, hibernating animals know, at some level
[02:54:41] <manicennui> "Your dog or cat may be able to tell if you're home late from work or if dinner is delayed."
[02:54:49] <prussian> And ya. Animals know when the meal ticket is coming.
[02:54:50] <manicennui> "dinner is delayed" is the key I think. =P
[02:55:01] <prussian> It's humorous after DST kicks in
[02:55:03] <manicennui> Although I question whether cats actually understand it.
[02:55:14] <manicennui> To cats, it is always dinner time.
[02:55:52] <prussian> Dog up.

[02:56:37] <manicennui> Don't some bears come out of hibernation early if the weather changes uncharacteristically?
[02:56:38] <prussian> True ...
[02:56:46] <prussian> Not sure honestly.

[19:58:45] <drakonis> Not a technical term as such, but a term you'll hear in wargaming. It refers to experienced (and, these days, often middle aged) wargamers. The term was originally used as a nickname for members of Napoleons Old Guard. The term is French and means, literally, "grumbler." It reflects the attitude of the veteran troops who knew what was really going on but couldn't do much about it. So they
