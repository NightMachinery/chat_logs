[03:18:10] <afontain[m]> un petit rire https://wiki.gnugen.ch/reunions/pvs/20170928
[11:49:18] <sunyibo> me: hello support, I can't login to my ebanking.
[11:49:35] <sunyibo> (two hours of repetitive inputting of credentials)
[11:49:53] <sunyibo> support: the problem is that you are using linux.
[11:49:57] <sunyibo> the end.
[11:52:20] <afontain[m]> haha :'(
[11:53:06] <afontain[m]> did you try another browser ?
[11:53:12] <jonas[m]> proof of incompetence
[12:23:25] <Orbstheorem> I would just 'not mention' I'm running Linux.
[12:24:39] <Orbstheorem> Web browsers are designed to be platform-independent. Any platform-dependent behaviour is a design-flaw.
[12:32:04] <sunyibo> yep
[14:29:01] *** Quits: chiselfuse (~chiselfus@user/chiselfuse) (Remote host closed the connection)
[14:29:17] *** Joins: chiselfuse (~chiselfus@user/chiselfuse)
[17:09:02] <Orbstheorem> So, my monitoring just went haywire about a netsplit and I though Orion (Lausanne) had some sort of corruption error.
[17:09:29] <Orbstheorem> But in fact, my load balancer had a connectivity issue only visible from Orion, but not from Zurich x)
[17:09:38] <Orbstheorem> <funny>
[18:37:12] <sunyibo> (turns out my password was too compley. 25 characters. Darn pass.)
[18:37:31] <Orbstheorem> Oh, right, I remember that!
[18:37:38] <Orbstheorem> I had the same problem with my bank!
[18:40:12] <typedef[m]> sunyibo: Ah yes, definitely related to your platform
[18:40:57] <sunyibo> It's funny, because in their "8 rules for a safe password" they mention password of at least 10 (max 50) characters.
[18:41:43] <sunyibo> And it's not like the site answered: your password is too long or too complex. Just 'error 400', try again or call support.
[18:42:05] <sunyibo> 5 supporters later: oh, maybe I should try a shorter password.
[18:42:27] <Orbstheorem> I've been spoiled by this: https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html#evaluation-code-snippets-in-comments
[18:42:34] <Orbstheorem> Now, I want it on every language!
[18:51:02] <Orbstheorem> smarter: Is there expression evaluation in source comments on metals?
[18:51:12] <Orbstheorem> (Not in a worksheet)
[18:53:52] <smarter> pas que je sache
