[02:30:07] <hajonnes> phogg, well thanks anyways. I think I have to dig deaper on the winehq forum. I think the wine environment is a special case to make it work.
[02:30:23] <Gustavo6046> akoana: look for xhci_pci

[02:30:45] <phogg> hajonnes: it shouldn't be that special. Once wine creates an X window it is subject to all of the usual X commands. It may be necessary to give it some time to react, though.

Block size is a filesystem-specific and/or operation-specific feature, with 4-5 meanings, so it wouldn't be the same (for some meaning of it, even on the *same* filesystem/partition)

[11:26:19] <SteveR> in the producer consumer problem.
[11:26:19] <SteveR> the consumer cant consume when the producer has not produced anything.
[11:26:20] <SteveR> in this case the thread is made to sleep and then when the producer has produced something,
[11:26:20] <SteveR> monitor can wake up the thread and consume something
[11:26:27] <SteveR> is this how monitor works?
[11:26:44] <SteveR> and what if the thread is given a lock rather than putting it to sleep?
[11:27:07] <ThinkT510> yay, sufficient context
[11:27:22] <ayecee> is it?
[11:27:33] <pankaj> hexnewbie: Going through the documentation on 'mkfs' the block size can be modified but I don't know whether it is possible to modify sector size. I ran "sudo fdisk -l | grep 'Sector size'" as 512 bytes but it does not seem to have any relation with any of my partitions. can sector size be changed at all? Is it device specific like HDD, SSD or any other media? In case yes then how?
[11:28:00] <Aryan> GuoDong, ok, I'll generate a new key for my work from my home pc. how is that?
[11:28:03] <hexnewbie> [XX:52:00] <hexnewbie> pankaj: Sector size of a block device cannot be modified

[15:38:30] <joo> kfrench, ah ok, i dont really do a lot of processing, just cats and greps and stuff like that :-)
[15:38:46] <xx> kfrench: I know that, but I mean for the output of `file myfile.jpg`
[15:39:04] <joo> but if i have a cronjob to always duplicate the folder to ram disk, will it be considerable faster then ?
[15:39:15] <hexnewbie> xx: Resolution is dots (pixels) per inch. Aspect ratio is width in centimetres per height in centimetres.
[15:39:19] <kfrench> xx:  Yeah, it says "resolution (DPI)", which sounds odd.
[15:39:27] <xx> my point exactly
[15:40:08] <kfrench> joo: If you only count the cats and greps, then probably.  If you count the copy+cats, then probably not.
[15:40:57] <xx> e.g. if you use the sample file https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Felis_silvestris_silvestris.jpg then it will show "...  JFIF standard 1.02, resolution (DPI), density 200x200, ..." in output of `file Felis_silvestris_silvestris.jpg`

[15:41:26] <hexnewbie> xx: file only says the file type (and potentially what it contains in terms of metadata), not what that metadata *is*, identify may be more useful. If you already know the pixels, you *can* compute the aspect ratio from the square resolution
[15:41:31] <kfrench> joo: If you wanted that cron job to finish faster so that followup tasks could start sooner, and you had nothing to do before the cron job started, you could do that copy to ramfs, or maybe just cat those files to /dev/null.  That would prime-the-pump so to speak.

[15:44:01] <nomagno> Is there any channel that's appropiate for discussion of 3D model formats?
[15:44:28] <xx> hexnewbie: because `identify myfile.jpg` produces *identical results*
[15:44:32] <kfrench> joo:  I used to have a nightly backup job that backed stuff up to disk.  The job would automatically free up space as it went about its business.  Later, I added another job that freed up space before backups run.  It let the backups complete faster.  I.e. I split the task up a bit and did some of the unimportant work before the actual job was scheduled to start.

[16:20:04] <esselfe> is the record hosted by a provider or your own service? When it happens to me I have to wait for TTL to expire

[16:45:37] <rasta> because it fails if you use different interfaces with different DNS servers
[16:45:50] <rasta> like VPN connections
[16:46:08] <rasta> also, it may cache and fail
[16:46:13] <Psi-Jack> Well, you're doing it wrong. YOu can have it direct queries to different servers FOR the BENEFIT of VPN connections.

[16:49:24] <Psi-Jack> Depends. OpenVPN works OOTB with systemd-resolved quite well on its own. You connect, if dns is pushed and you use systemd-resolved, it automatically adds the "Stubs" to systemd-resolved on connect, and removes them on disconnect. Best thing since sliced bread!
[16:49:58] <Psi-Jack> You can setup similar things with other VPNS, and it works right with NetworkManager managed VPN connections too, practically seamlessly.

[18:26:53] <pushqrdx> Psi-Jack so i figured out what prevented rollbacks from applying, it was rootflags=subvol=${rootsubvol} in grub, the resulting grub.cfg always pointed to @rootfs because of that so it was ignoring fstab and snapper setting up the default subvolume, so all i had to do is update /etc/grub.d/XX_linux and remove that part from it then run update-grub
[18:27:37] <Psi-Jack> pushqrdx: Yeah. I was wondering about that. And I wonder what's the real genuine fix for that issue, because that doesn't sound like a "reasonable" fix to me.

[20:26:11] <twainwek> this is worse: it upgraded the kernel by itself
[20:26:20] <TheGuestMovie> by default ubuntu (and debian) run apt upgrade (not distro upgrade) every night. Since it's the same kernel version with a patch bump it's still the same ABI as before.

[20:45:49] <rascul> maybe some other package selection would have pulled it in, but that also doesn't mean it's enabled

[22:03:23] <koollman> Eryn83FL_Matrix[: containers are not going away. Docker has some huge impact, so most knowledge about it is useful even if it's mostly to remember what's different in whichever will be used instead :)
[22:03:34] <HiccupJul> i guess it would be a WM-specific thing rather than a DE-specific thing.
[22:04:41] <phogg> HiccupJul: the program which acts as the WM has to maintain its metadata about windows somewhere. To some extent the X server does that, but it probably doesn't track everything the WM knows
[22:05:08] <phogg> HiccupJul: in any case the WM is typically the program keeping X from exiting, so you have to be careful not to actually terminate it

[22:05:34] <HiccupJul> i've been using ctrl-alt-backspace which kicks me back to the login screen but at least unfreezes cinnamon
[22:05:42] <phogg> HiccupJul: once again e16 is a winner: in the default install you right click the wallpaper and there's a "Restart" in the menu, or failing that you can use eesh -e 'exit restart'
[22:05:46] <HiccupJul> cinnamon likes to freeze when dragging-and-dropping sometimes, its annoying...
[22:06:08] <HiccupJul> found an interesting suggestion when googling: `setsid cinnamon --replace &`
[22:06:13] <Eryn83FL_Matrix[> hmmm
[22:06:33] <HiccupJul> e.g. run that in another terminal and you should get another cinnamon session
[22:06:53] <phogg> HiccupJul: C-a-backspace should be avoided! That's X11 auto-zap, which is not only a big kind of hammer, but it can leave your video card in an unstable state and require a reload of the kernel driver (or a reboot) to fix.
[22:07:21] <HiccupJul> i guess i will disable ctrl-alt-backspace then...
[22:07:29] <phogg> HiccupJul: your first move should be to kill the WM process (send it SIGTERM), or possibly to just try to SIGHUP it and see if it wakes back up

[22:08:15] <phogg> chances of it *actually* doing anything bad are pretty low
[22:08:26] <HiccupJul> i mean, the freeze is triggered by clicking on an icon in the "quick launch" style bar in the taskbar, but accidentally dragging it

[22:11:19] <johnjay> you want DOS on the bare metal playing games? sounds hardcore

[22:11:24] <phogg> if it works it works
[22:11:25] <micrex22> phogg: not nonsense. People have had MS-DOS databases corrupt from running DOSBox
[22:11:29] <hexnewbie> nomagno: DOSEMU and DOSBox offer various degrees of compatibility. DOSBox is tailored towards games, so they would refuse patches regarding e.g. printing support (so little luck with running Word 5.5 which is now free), but there's a fork of DOSemu that uses QEMU, *and* forks with DOSBox with non-gaming features

[22:41:14] <SnoopJ> hexnewbie, my approach in Python was to exclude the entire map(s) that I scraped from /proc/ which are already page-aligned AIUI. But yes, I'm just trying to save size here.
[22:41:31] <hexnewbie> SnoopJ: Your address is not aligned. So you have half a page. You need to decide do you want to give the same madvise() for the whole page you have a part of, or skip it. Sending one for the whole page may even be problematic.

[23:05:36] <TheGuestMovie> johnjay: it's nice, but it prevents running newer software because the dependencies that devs rely on, are too old on Debian systems. On Windows it's simple, they just ship a newer DLL and use that. On Linux this is harder leading to dependency hell.

[23:07:41] <phogg> TheGuestMovie: app bundles are a bad idea. Docker as an app bundle alternative is a popular trope, and it's in some ways less bad than other attempts.
[23:07:56] <johnjay> TheGuestMovie: maybe there is validity to what you're saying. idk. definitely jst building software alone is incredibly more complex than i thought it would be
[23:08:21] <Blondie101010> stahl:  please provide clearer context, as I can't find '\G' on that page
[23:08:25] <johnjay> but using an entire OS just for one app is stupid. the whole point of an OS is to multitask applications
[23:08:27] <phogg> johnjay: you are perhaps gaining some appreciation for the thankless task distro packagers have been performing for you
[23:08:31] <blackgatonegro> Just use containers; that way if something goes wrong you can't change the app at all and have to wait for an update.
[23:08:44] <TheGuestMovie> phogg: why is it a bad idea in an age where we all have at a minimum 500GB storage? Why should I care if the apps I use end up using 1GB more in total ?

[23:10:27] <blackgatonegro> Yeah as in using a complete different app.
[23:10:28] <phogg> TheGuestMovie: doing shared library management in a way which is "theoretically correct" from my POV *and* doesn't make life a nightmare for app developers is a fiendishly difficult thing. IMO the NixOS approach is a good one.
