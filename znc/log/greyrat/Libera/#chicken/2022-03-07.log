[19:52:03] <siiky> Bunny351 & wasamasa: any of you know how to mitm myself with socat? I have a server running on port 9000, and a client connecting to port 3000; I tried using  `socat TCP4-LISTEN:3000 TCP4:localhost:9000`  to "redirect" traffic from the port 3000 to the server, but socat exits after the client tries to connect (I think)... And the client says ECONNREFUSED
[19:56:31] <siiky> if you know of any better way I'm all ears (:  I need to "simulate" network failure between the client and the server, with both running on the same computer
[20:14:39] <wasamasa> that's an example from the manual, no
[20:14:45] <wasamasa> it says it won't accept a second connection
[20:16:19] <wasamasa> there's an example after that forks new processes
[20:19:26] <siiky> it's fine to accept only a single connection because there's only one client
[20:19:32] <wasamasa> yeah, your example works fine here
[20:19:46] <wasamasa> python -m http.server # localhost, port 8000
[20:20:00] <wasamasa> socat TCP4-LISTEN:9000 TCP4:localhost:8000 # port forwarding from 9000 to 8000
[20:20:10] <wasamasa> curl localhost:9000 # initiate pipeline
[20:20:24] <siiky> hmmm
[20:21:02] <wasamasa> if I add ,fork to the left side of the socat command, it stays open
[20:23:03] <siiky> that's working here too
[20:23:06] <siiky> hmmm
[20:26:13] <siiky> and it looks like it worked with the real client/server too... so fork was really needed? I must have misunderstood the point of fork
[20:26:17] <siiky> thanks wasamasa !
[20:28:51] <wasamasa> if you think about it, forking is what you do in the UNIX world instead of using threads
[20:29:14] <wasamasa> you have a child process doing something very similar to the parent process
[20:35:01] <siiky> right, but I thought the connection would stay open while the client is trying to talk with the server

[23:26:35] <wasamasa> wow
[23:26:44] <wasamasa> there's a touhou rendition of CHICKEN
[23:26:47] <wasamasa> I think

[23:30:20] <siiky> wow have to share this with some weeb friends
[23:30:53] <siiky> erlang looks too annoyed to be realistic; should be completely calm
[23:31:11] <wasamasa> I dunno
[23:32:12] <wasamasa> I just recognized that's supposed to be lilypond above the scheme one
[23:32:55] <wasamasa> dunno about the m one in the middle with the upside down CRT
[23:33:04] <wasamasa> is that supposed to be mathematica?
[23:33:15] <siiky> the red bomb-looking thing?
[23:33:21] <wasamasa> yes
[23:33:32] <siiky> idk that either
[23:34:05] <siiky> don't think mathematica has a logo(?)
[23:34:26] <wasamasa> it has actually, but a different one
[23:34:33] <wasamasa> F is fortran apparently
[23:35:17] <siiky> I always find that C++ (and C) logo weird... never in my life before Zeal had I seen those logos lol
[23:35:35] <wasamasa> yup
[23:38:41] <wasamasa> oh, it's malbolge
[23:38:54] <wasamasa> https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/5172883
[23:40:42] <siiky> > Malbolge was very difficult to understand when it arrived. It took two years for the first Malbolge program to appear. The author himself has never written a Malbolge program. The first program was not written by a human being; it was generated by a beam search algorithm designed by Andrew Cooke and implemented in Lisp.
