[00:00:05] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: the argument was without reading, against basically the concept of any white person being able to write a non-white person (and NOT the only time I've seen this argument)
[00:00:09] <Poeticode> can we still write about orcs and gnomes

[00:00:27] <emmeka> like "some non-white guy snapped at me once and told me I shouldn't be allowed to do shitty things" is not equivalent to having power to make it so
[00:00:34] <TsundereNoises> Poeticode: no, orcs are coded black, gnomes are scandinavian

[00:00:51] <paine> that's absurd
[00:00:58] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: in this case it actually really was pretty silencing
[00:01:00] <paine> those creatures exist within the fantasy realm
[00:01:17] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I kind of attribute that interaction to the group falling apart actually

[00:01:51] <Fenderbassist> superior dark vision
[00:01:51] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: but again, it wasn't at the level of "I have read your work and this is bad caricature" it was at the conceptual level of unwritten work
[00:02:14] <emmeka> TsundereNoises I would suggest that any writer who wants to write a character that, in this society, is a part of a group that faces active discrimination from the group the author is a part of, should tread very very carefully.
[00:02:36] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: sure, but to me that also seems to be something vitally worth doing
[00:03:00] <emmeka> if only it were so vitally worth doing that it were generally done well, but it is what it is
[00:03:19] <emmeka> all of this doesn't matter because you, me and the random guy in your writer's circle can't stop anyone from doing this
[00:03:48] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I mean, that's kind of my problem with the whole argument actually, it DOES stop people, but only the people who care about trying to do it well
[00:03:58] <emmeka> I disagree.
[00:04:07] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: it doesn't stop the guys who want to write about Nanook the seal clubber and the cherokee princess
[00:04:29] <TsundereNoises> I wanted to come up with a different example but I couldn't think of a better one that's stupid enough
[00:05:31] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I agree that it's important to be careful, and actually I think the practice of having someone who shares an identity with the character in question read the story and comment on things they think are wrong is a really great idea
[00:05:54] <emmeka> to me it's indicative that there's a certain kind of twitter mob that white people have to interact with and they go "omg, this is terrible, I had to deal with a person telling me I'm doing something wrong with 0 consequences for an entire 11 seconds" and then give no thought to the irony of it
[00:06:15] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: but that's shockingly tough to do, and in recent years it seems theres more and more people who want to push back against that as a concept
[00:06:46] <emmeka> I mean I get that too, though.
[00:06:47] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I think you're seriously misunderstanding/misrepresenting the creative process here
[00:07:12] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: british people/americans exchanging writing to check dialect stuff is pretty common and works well
[00:07:28] <MootPoot> wtf
[00:07:36] <TsundereNoises> prevents stuff like american kids being in the "girl guides" which you'd never be able to google for that being a problem
[00:07:36] <MootPoot> calibre reader is crashing my display drivers
[00:07:55] <TsundereNoises> any cross-cultural writing has tons of pitfalls you basically can't easily search for
[00:08:08] <emmeka> there's no girl guides in the US?!
[00:08:15] <emmeka> how do you get the cookies?!
[00:08:15] <TsundereNoises> it's girl scouts!
[00:08:25] <emmeka> oh.
[00:08:32] <TsundereNoises> and they do have cookies
[00:08:33] <emmeka> that doesn't work here, because girls can be scouts.
[00:08:43] <TsundereNoises> yes, you are a more civilized people
[00:08:46] <emmeka> as in, "boy" scouts admits both boys and girls
[00:08:54] <emmeka> we had a girl in my scout troop as a kid
[00:09:02] * TsundereNoises gasps in horror
[00:09:10] <emmeka> she could beat most of us up :(
[00:09:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Why not just call them the scouts?
[00:09:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> emmeka: nice
[00:09:14] <emmeka> we do
[00:09:26] <TsundereNoises> if you allow boys and girls to interact, next thing you know teenagers will be having sex outside of marriage
[00:09:34] <emmeka> they used to be called the boy scouts in ye olde days and are in the US, I guess
[00:09:37] <paine> why are teenagers getting married
[00:09:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> TsundereNoises: Oh the humanity.
[00:10:13] <TsundereNoises> yeah, we have boyscouts and girl scouts, not sure if it's still true but the boy scouts used to be kind of a regressive trashfire and the girl scouts were pretty cool
[00:10:26] <TsundereNoises> like they aren't administered together or anything, totally separate organizations
[00:10:29] <emmeka> I should've been a girl guide instead. then I would've got cookies.
[00:10:36] <TsundereNoises> exactly
[00:10:51] <emmeka> though I don't know if back then they let boys be girl guides
[00:10:57] <MootPoot> I did exactly none of this guide stuff
[00:11:01] <MootPoot> and stayed indoors 
[00:11:05] <MootPoot> and played ps2
[00:11:48] <paine> i didn't need a guide, i grew up in the wilderness
[00:11:57] <paine> if you grew up playing ps2 you're definitely a youngin'
[00:12:05] <TsundereNoises> yeah, we just were told to go out in the woods to play, but I wasn't a scout
[00:12:10] <TsundereNoises> could have been, but it seemed lame to me
[00:12:14] <emmeka> apparently we've had co-ed scouting since 1972 for some levels, and 1992 for all of them. that's pretty early.

[00:12:24] <emmeka> TsundereNoises the lameness is part of its goodness
[00:12:32] <emmeka> you have to wear dorky uniforms and do dorky things
[00:12:39] <emmeka> but you are not alone in your dorkiness
[00:12:58] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I filled up my childhood dorkness quotient in other ways
[00:13:10] <paine> i was a band nerd later in childhood
[00:13:20] <paine> i tell myself that was enough
[00:13:39] <TsundereNoises> I was in band until halfway through high school, the band teacher was a shit and I quit at that point
[00:13:46] <TsundereNoises> otherwise I just read lots of books
[00:13:54] <paine> it turned out my band leader was a paedophile and he killed himself in 2014 i think xd
[00:13:55] <TsundereNoises> and played D&D and board games
[00:14:08] <paine> some years after i had finished high school
[00:14:18] <TsundereNoises> I never actually learned to summon satan, either from D&D OR magic cards, it was really disappointing
[00:14:21] <emmeka> I was in scouts the whole way up to uhhhh Venturer level, I think. From the age of 5 to 14
[00:14:27] <paine> mtg :3

[00:14:53] <TsundereNoises> paine: we legitimately had parents in our school not wanting to let kids play magic because of the satanism
[00:15:17] <paine> yeah it was banned in my school as well... they also didn't like pokemon cards that much when they first came out
[00:15:22] <emmeka> MootPoot the girl in our scout troop wasn't super sex-able
[00:15:37] <paine> you were so young, you weren't even thinking about sex, stop
[00:15:43] <paine> or wait, maybe you were
[00:15:48] <emmeka> paine I just said I was there til I was 14
[00:15:49] <Jigsy> Urm, I was playing Doctor when I was around 7.
[00:15:50] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: last comment on the other thing: a reason this bugs me so much is I think it's emblematic of a common liberal trend where we demonize the fuck out of people trying to do the right thing, so only people who don't care about doing the right thing are left trying
[00:15:53] <Jigsy> So, shows what you know.
[00:16:25] <Roey> why are some folks so messed up like that.
[00:16:25] <paine> jigsy that's really not okay, you need therapy
[00:16:26] <emmeka> !findquote emmeka cousin doctor
[00:16:26] <ImoutoBot> emmeka: (164 / 181) <e​mmeka> we caught my little brother playing doctor with his cousin when he was like 6 <e​mmeka> saving that one for a wedding speech
[00:16:32] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: and it's not, in cases like this, 30 seconds, it's something much longer term in terms of how much time people (even those not invoved, it wasn't my story) end up thinking about it
[00:16:42] <Jigsy> Therapy... for?
[00:17:02] <paine> well, was the other person playing at least age appropriate?
[00:17:02] <Jigsy> ...having fun?
[00:17:07] <Jigsy> Same age.
[00:17:11] <paine> alright, that's fine
[00:17:38] <TsundereNoises> you should worry if the kids say they're playing "Uncle"
[00:17:42] <emmeka> TsundereNoises I still think you should think a bit harder about the fact that you care so much about this and not about any of the reasons a person might react that way, or might hold that position
[00:18:13] <paine> oh no
[00:18:49] <emmeka> MootPoot I do think people should put all their kids, boys and girls, in scouts though. Or guides or whatever.
[00:18:58] <emmeka> teach them the virtues or being a dork in the forest
[00:19:02] <Jigsy> Pretty sure boys aren't allowed in the guides.
[00:19:03] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I still think you should stop implying this means I don't care about any of the actual racism that abounds
[00:19:18] <emmeka> Jigsy they are here, afaik
[00:19:28] <paine> the problem with scouts/guide is that it's actually a prohibitively expensive program
[00:19:34] <paine> if it were actually available for everybody to access
[00:20:16] <emmeka> TsundereNoises you're taking this wrong, but there's no way to get around it. It's inevitable that you'd react by thinking I'm just slandering you as a racist even when I phrase it in a way that asks you to reflect.
[00:20:38] <emmeka> this is part of the problem at hand, really
[00:21:18] <emmeka> that you're not thinking about the implications instead of just reacting to the idea that someone suggested [thing you might do] could be problematic because [reasons you don't like]
[00:21:18] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: it's hard not to read it as original sin type logic here

[00:21:51] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: and it wasn't a suggestion that something was potentially problematic, the guy in question was WELL aware of that, it's the whole reason it was brought up in the first place
[00:22:55] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: also I'm additionally salty about a) the fact that that writing group fell apart, because it was really damn helpful for a brief period and b) what I am having a lot of trouble not taking as you making either really uncharitable assumptions about me or a fallacious argument strategy
[00:23:20] <emmeka> you're still doing it though
[00:24:06] <TsundereNoises> see I'm unclear on what those last two messages are even doing in that vein, as I thought they were kind of around the point
[00:24:11] <TsundereNoises> tangential, that's the word
[00:24:44] <TsundereNoises> as in, I don't see those 2 messages as even being about my own reflection or thoughts or whatnot re: the issue at hand
[00:24:45] <emmeka> I'm not very good at this conversation, no matter how many times I end up in it
[00:25:04] <MootPoot> emmeka: so practice does not make perfect?
[00:25:10] <TsundereNoises> not in this case apparently
[00:25:39] <TsundereNoises> it does really suck to have friends imply you are something you really despise, and it's happened 2 times lately with emmeka on different topics
[00:25:50] <TsundereNoises> I don't mean to use that as a weapon either
[00:25:59] <TsundereNoises> but I think that contributes to my adverse reaction
[00:26:50] <TsundereNoises> but like the "you're still doing it" in response to something that to me seems tangential, makes it hard to feel like there's a message I could type that isn't "I'm sorry, you're right" that doesn't get that response
[00:26:56] <emmeka> but the point here is that when presented with a scenario where ~liberalism has run amok~ and your reaction to it is to go "absurd! me! a racist! the very idea! the nerve!" you should stop and breathe and realize that this is not an attempt to slander you or tattoo a swastika on your forehead or whatever, but instead think about what could be going on to have resulted in this
[00:27:42] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I agree that "liberalism run amok" BS is very often used as cover for bad shit, but I also have spent like 20+ hours thinking about this/related things and stand by it here
[00:27:52] <emmeka> and be less worried about your own personal fault in any events, which is both a poor way to frame it and irrelevant, and more worried about the potential discourse which could be important
[00:28:31] <TsundereNoises> I mean, the thing in question is just an anecdote, it's personally annoying to me more than anything
[00:28:42] <TsundereNoises> but it's… representative?
[00:28:53] <emmeka> ...of liberalism running amok?
[00:28:57] <TsundereNoises> yup
[00:29:00] <TsundereNoises> heil hitler
[00:29:09] <emmeka> and of thing that make you want to say "absurd! me! a racist! the very idea! the nerve!"
[00:29:21] <emmeka> follow the rest of the sentence from there
[00:29:47] <TsundereNoises> of something that's I think getting more common in non-internet circles from the internet, and actively counterproductive
[00:31:09] <emmeka> it's the liberals' faults, really, for putting this stupid notion into the head of every palefaced shmuck that racism is a thing that happens when You Are A Bad Person, and not like, a social construct or element of society independent of the individual.
[00:31:34] <emmeka> but I can't do any better than this today, so, moving on
[00:31:53] <emmeka> Jigsy I looked it up, boys can't be girlscouts. but transgirls can, apparently. so there's that.

[02:19:12] <isekaijin> I need to take screenshots of very precise and small portions of the screen (not of Discord itself), so I need to drag the mouse for a few seconds.
[02:19:51] <thiccdaddy> i'm making cookies
[02:19:52] <isekaijin> If Discord isn't open, then this works mostly fine. (Except when for some reason my mouse slips, but that's my fault, not Discord's.)
[02:20:26] <isekaijin> However, when Discord is open, occasionally I see (parts of) the selection rectangle in the screenshot itself.

[02:20:53] <isekaijin> thiccdaddy: Nice.
[02:21:40] <Terminus> isekaijin: i've never had that problem. i do use the trackpoint on my laptop for more precise selection though. trackpad sucks for precision.
[02:22:04] <isekaijin> Trackpad? I'm using a desktop computer and a real mouse.
[02:22:14] <Terminus> if you've got an old PC, that might be the problem. discord is a hog since it's just electron.
[02:22:40] <isekaijin> The problem is that stupid people make PDFs with little to no line separation.
[02:22:55] <Terminus> bottom line, i've never had trouble with taking screenshots while discord is open, whether on windows or linux.
[02:23:18] <Terminus> and the majority of the screenshots i take are snips of a portion of the screen.
[02:24:42] <isekaijin> Ah, I see.

[04:25:52] <isekaijin> I have seen those things. I just didn't know the English word for them.
[04:26:07] <Fenderbassist> :)
[04:28:26] <isekaijin> Seriously, scammers are getting sneakier. I get a phone call from an ordinary-looking phone number (i.e., normal line owned by an individual), but the caller claims to be my phone operator and claims that I owe them money.
[04:29:12] <isekaijin> But I know that I have instructed my bank to pay my phone bills automatically, because who wants to be arsed paying them manually?
[04:30:30] <isekaijin> Plus the voice is clearly a woman trying to sound as robotic as the automated callers (“press 1 to <do this>, press 2 to <do that>, ...”), but not quite succeeding at it.
[04:31:12] <isekaijin> Can't we just burn those people? Why are there restrictions on burning people who are clearly worthless or even have negative value to society?
[04:32:45] <Fenderbassist> societies need to outlaw these things, imho, through complaints/votes/contacting representatives
[04:32:56] <Fenderbassist> to me it's all harassing scams, a double whammy
[04:33:03] <isekaijin> Yeah.
[04:33:04] <Fenderbassist> you are harassed and you have to avoid scams
[04:34:28] <isekaijin> Fortunately, I know that I shouldn't get calls from my phone operator on this topic. I just get an email notification that <X amount> has been charged to my account. But there are people who might fall for these things.
[04:34:42] <Fenderbassist> especially older people
[04:34:45] <isekaijin> Yeah.

[08:57:39] <DandereNoises> what's wrong MootPoot
[08:57:59] <MootPoot> cant sleep
[08:58:10] <mexen> Anything on your mind?
[08:58:15] <gh0s1> Turn off the computer

[08:58:48] <MootPoot> just not tired
[08:58:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> gh0s1: Staring at the ceiling for hours isn't conducive to sleep.
[08:59:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It is conducive to annoyance, however.
[08:59:11] <gh0s1> Better than staring into a bright computer screen
[08:59:13] <mexen> Satin and I were talking about not being able to sleep and how reading a book might help. Just a few pages
[08:59:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> gh0s1: That assumes MootPoot isn't adjusting contrast & tones.
[08:59:36] <gh0s1> Doesn't matter
[08:59:48] <jbwncster> Night mode
[08:59:50] <mexen> Yeah, I will take ceiling staring in a dark room to browsing /v/ on a device
[08:59:54] <gh0s1> I talked to multiple sleep therapists
[09:00:09] <gh0s1> While it helps, it's still a bright light
[09:00:13] <mexen> If you're going to use a screen, at least it should be e-ink display technology
[09:00:19] <gh0s1> ^
[09:00:34] * MootPoot is installing chinese spyware on his computer
[09:00:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> gh0s1: So you're suggesting learning braille & display affordability are the main answer then?
[09:00:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Because an e-ink display won't be usable without eye-strain in low-light conditions.
[09:00:57] <gh0s1> No, I suggest turning off the computer
[09:01:05] <gh0s1> And go to bed
[09:01:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> gh0s1: You're suggesting that as if it won't end up in simply hours of frustrated boredom before either, thankfully, passing out for an hour or two before you have two work again, or literally having to get up to work without having slept at all.

[09:03:43] <MootPoot> non of them are carnoically lesbian so you're out of luck there

[09:06:26] <DandereNoises> I complained about this being a trend among fansubs a few years back, some of their sizes just blowing up for no good reason
[09:06:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's weird. FLAC & ALAC both sound as good as WAV anyway...
[09:07:06] <DandereNoises> not using WAV, I bet you don't play all your music on an authentic 1950s record player either

[10:24:45] <ButterNoodle> if its a gram off its fine
[10:24:54] <MootPoot> I just select the 2 cups setting on my electric burr grinder
[10:25:00] <MootPoot> and then dump that in the filter
[10:25:10] <ButterNoodle> u dont rinse the filter first?
[10:25:17] <MootPoot> no
[10:25:20] <ButterNoodle> nasty
[10:25:25] <MootPoot> ?

[10:26:14] <MootPoot> oh
[10:26:20] <ButterNoodle> just rinse the filter

[10:26:33] <ButterNoodle> any amount
[10:26:33] <MootPoot> then put coffee in and pour with cup at the bottom
[10:26:41] <MootPoot> ok
[10:26:44] <MootPoot> I'll try that
[10:26:48] <ButterNoodle> yes like normal.. u wet the coffee first?

[10:26:55] <ButterNoodle> yep #metoo

[10:27:30] <MootPoot> not sure how fine to make the grounds though
[10:27:34] <ButterNoodle> put in about 50gr of water and wait for it to gas out
[10:27:50] <ButterNoodle> then take it up to 350 gr of water
[10:27:59] <MootPoot> coarse on this grinder is like the nescafe instant coarse kind of size
[10:28:04] <ButterNoodle> then pour the rest down the sides

[10:28:25] <MootPoot> ye that's what I do except I dont really measure out exactly how much I'm pouring down
[10:28:29] <ButterNoodle> then I ran out of chapters
[10:28:39] <MootPoot> during the wetting stage vs the actual pour

[10:59:43] <MootPoot> personal goal is to know a popular language and know it WELL
[10:59:51] <MootPoot> like within the top 10% kind of well

[11:00:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> @ top 10%
[11:01:19] <MootPoot> I imagine the top 3% of people are into compiler dev
[11:01:32] <MootPoot> and 80% are just people who use the langauge and dont care
[11:01:56] <MootPoot> somewhere between that 80 and 97 are the non compiler devs but otherwise specialists
[11:02:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I would imagine the only people who know even half of the problems with C's fuzziness are all compiler devs or people who've read the spec.
[11:02:15] <MootPoot> C#*
[11:02:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And C is a relatively small language.

[11:05:22] <MootPoot> its probably arrogant of me to say this but I think I outrank most jr devs

[11:05:35] <MootPoot> not a hard thing to do really

[12:13:37] <Satin> jessedesu_onaph: who said I'm humble
[12:14:25] <jessedesu_onaph> I just did
[12:14:41] <Satin> I'm deeply flawed like anyone else, I just also happen to be deeply self aware about my own shortcomings, and sometimes strengths that's 'bout it.
[12:14:47] <Satin> Smh
[12:15:04] <Satin> Also i slept for 8 hours
[12:15:08] <Satin> from 4 to 12 am
[12:15:20] <Satin> and i need to go back to sleep... ill use melatonin?
[12:15:39] <jessedesu_onaph> How long were u awake before then
[12:16:09] <Satin> I've been getting very little sleep no matter how much I tried for 2-3 nights before.
[12:16:18] <Satin> only 3hr the night before
[12:16:23] <Satin> 2h the night before that
[12:16:41] <Satin> struggling with sleep schedule stuff. the semester also began today so

[12:20:28] <ImoutoBot> Satin: (21 / 97) <B​co1981> watamote... is she pure ??... naah she is a fujoshi
[12:20:41] <PancakeMatsuri> I'm doing a lot of shit to improve quality of ife
[12:20:45] <PancakeMatsuri> *life
[12:20:54] <PancakeMatsuri> this week
[12:21:05] <Satin> I've been doing shit to gradually improve my routine and do what I've always wanted to get done.
[12:21:31] <PancakeMatsuri> What do you want to get done?
[12:22:48] <Satin> A lot. A lot of this has to do with inner-mind shit that will sound weird when I try to articulate it.
[12:23:20] <Satin> I'm fairly neurotic. For me I've been wary of myself struggling to have routines, have healthy mindsets about things, stuff like
[12:23:27] <Satin> talking about doing something, and then not actually doing it? etc
[12:24:05] <Satin> But I'm actually doing stuff now. And it's not just doing stuff, it's doing stuff with a far more healthy/mature mindset than I could have ever imagined. If I miss a day it's not suddenly the end of the world, and I'm not panicking over a fear of failure etc.
[12:24:53] <Satin> It just feels like a lot of things led to this point, getting shot means I got entirely torn down and had to rebuild. Also my recent weight loss journey and doing fitness has helped a lot in other areas!
[12:25:23] <Satin> Now I'm actually for example, doing my skincare routine whether I tell someone or not I did it. Or learning to cook slowly, or maintain my own surroundings like it's second habit. Still working on it :3
[12:26:31] <Satin> The biggest challenge of course is *actually* doing school and pushing for As this semester. I got them before in community college, but that was relatively easier. Getting them now is going to require *actual* doubling down. So that's the biggest challenge right now, and getting my sleep schedule fixed is important :p
[12:26:32] <PancakeMatsuri> Satin, great to hear. I've been slowly improving my life too )
[12:26:36] <Satin> yay
[12:27:16] <PancakeMatsuri> I'm getting ventilation in this room, it has none
[12:27:38] <PancakeMatsuri> Lack of oxygen made me feel bad, and I didn't know
[12:27:41] <Satin> I've noticed a lot that has been holding me back w/ schoolwork is always the "extra" shit. Lacking self-confidence, comparing myself to others even if not consciously, and so on. I have a far more healthier mindset now, and it's about giving it my best shot.
[12:27:48] <Satin> PancakeMatsuri: that's interesting
[12:27:53] <Satin> and yeah, oxygen importanttt
[12:28:09] <Satin> PancakeMatsuri: So is taking walks and such, if it isn't freezing outside like with MootPoot XD
[12:28:34] <PancakeMatsuri> Satin, I bought a CO2 sensor. Yesterday, it was like up to 750 from 400, and I noticed I feel like shit. Adding a usb fan to the window helped.
[12:28:43] <mexen> Yo Satin, did you manage to sleep?
[12:28:47] <Satin> I was afraid I wouldn't use my $200 Garmin smartwatch after buying it, but it actually is a critical piece for me.
[12:28:56] <Satin> mexen: I did, but not in the way I wanted to HAHA.
[12:29:10] <Satin> mexen: I crashed very hard after my physics class and watching anime with friends. I fell asleep at 4 pm
[12:29:12] <Satin> woke up at 12 am
[12:29:28] <Satin> So I'm considering taking melatonin now and going back to sleep and waking up at  7 am hopefully to start my day.
[12:29:41] * Satin hasn't found any google results that suggest taking melatonin after a lot of sleep is bad
[12:30:03] * Satin maybe oversleeping has bad consequences in the long term though, but that doesn't apply to this situation
[12:30:26] <Satin> Folks, preserve your sane sleep schedules. It's too hard to switch. Seriously.

[12:37:57] <PancakeMatsuri> I dunno, I've been using Mac
[12:38:54] <PancakeMatsuri> I feel they're pretty much interchangeable
[12:39:11] <PancakeMatsuri> calendars
[12:40:21] <Satin> That's true, I guess for me it's about what's compatible with hooking up to other stuff, like intergrations and what not
[12:40:31] <Satin> and what has more additional features if any but hmm,
[12:41:19] <PancakeMatsuri> I know there's Zoho and Nextcloud, but Zoho isn't free, and you have to host Nextcloud
[12:41:46] <PancakeMatsuri> I don't use any integrations, never heard about it
[12:41:51] <PancakeMatsuri> until now
[12:45:29] <Satin> hmm i see
[12:45:47] <Satin> yeah it's just like randomly, you'll find intergrations included in other apps/services with a calendar service like google calendar and what not
[12:45:59] <Satin> Tbh I want to use a FOSS/Free software solution but
[12:46:18] <Satin> accessibility/ease of use is far more important
[12:46:23] <Satin> for this kind of thing for me
[12:46:31] <Satin> I'll make sure my budgeting app will be FOSS though in the future
[12:46:58] <PancakeMatsuri> well, Google Calendar isn't bad

[13:46:28] <emmeka> about idk 10 years ago now, I decided to shut down all the old big corp emails I had at the time, and centralize everything into two different accounts. One is through riseup, for political or otherwise potentially problematic things. The other is through a French service with a privacy policy of refusing foreign warrants.
[13:46:39] <emmeka> that one I use for more professional and person stuff
[13:49:44] <emmeka> they're kind of neat though because they make a point of hosting all servers in France so they're subject to French law about privacy and data protection, which is much stronger than here.

[14:21:58] <emmeka> because naturally this was a disaster at the beginning of winter that left thousands homeless. The city of Toronto was at the time replacing its streetcar fleet, and someone got the strange idea that they could send old streetcars up here by rail to be used as houses
[14:22:28] <emmeka> so they did, as a humanitarian effort. they're kind of a local feature. if you look around you can still see some of them built into things

[15:28:08] <darkwitch> scams can be profitable
[15:28:13] <amigojapan> darkwitch: just got someone from another channel to take a trial lesson with my cram school
[15:28:24] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: the one they offered is on 11th floor, we have to pay the total amount now and it will take three years for them to complete the project
[15:28:29] <amigojapan> Damn. Is not a scam
[15:29:06] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: yes, lease it out, the rental to investment ratio is good
[15:29:18] <darkwitch> amigojapan, what sort of crazy lesson will you do with them?
[15:29:36] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, nice! :3
[15:29:54] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, three years tho. That's an opportunity cost
[15:29:58] <HubertFarnsworth> nyanpasu o/ amigojapan. How was your day?
[15:30:09] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, if you wouldn't mind me to ask, how much's the space?
[15:30:14] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I may be present in the first trial lesson. But the idea is that one of the native speakers ends up teaching them Japanese
[15:30:17] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: but afterwards good rental income
[15:30:40] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: had to travel a bit far to go to my clinic
[15:30:42] <Sadale> How could you ensure that the building would be completed tho? And how do you ensure that the rent wouldn't drop and someone would actually rent it?
[15:30:46] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: Rs 8000 per Sq. Feet
[15:31:03] <Sadale> ok. That's $110
[15:31:23] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: expecting lease at around Rs60-70 per Sq. Feet
[15:31:28] <Sadale> Assuming 1000sq-ft, that'd be $110k. That'd quite a bit
[15:32:09] <Sadale> So it'd take 123 months to reach ROI assuming Rs65 per sqft
[15:32:17] <darkwitch> amigojapan, I thought the school only had japanese people taking lessons. now it sounds less and less like a school every time you describe it :D
[15:32:20] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: I'm thinking of buying about 500 sq. feet but father doesn't want that much invested
[15:32:26] <Sadale> That's 10 years to reach ROI. That's a lot.
[15:32:39] <Sadale> hmm. like $50k
[15:32:54] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah
[15:33:02] <HubertFarnsworth> what say? good or bad?
[15:33:19] <Sadale> Dunno. If the rent's guaranteed, and the landprice won't drop that's nice.
[15:33:21] <Sadale> ttyl dinner
[15:33:24] <amigojapan> darkwitch: a user from this channelis also taking Japanese lessons there. And is doing well
[15:33:33] <Sadale> HubertFarnsworth, now that I'm, just a little bit, tempted to invest into this shit xD
[15:33:35] <HubertFarnsworth> that price for commercial is really good and cheap though
[15:33:39] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: ^^
[15:34:14] <Sadale> Not sure if it'd be safe for me to do so that as I'm not even in India. And it sounds very risky to me. But I do have the fund for that. xD
[15:34:17] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I told you it is really a よろずや
[15:34:21] <Sadale> ttyl dinner will get back at you later
[15:35:03] <darkwitch> amigojapan, yet you keep calling it a school, lol

[15:35:44] <HubertFarnsworth> woah, I never said you could invest Sadale. It's all hush hush business only in for people who know
[15:35:52] <HubertFarnsworth> because of low cost
[15:36:08] <HubertFarnsworth> I got this through my cousin.
[15:36:12] <amigojapan> darkwitch: yeah. It's easy to convey the basic idea that way

[15:52:17] <amigojapan> darkwitch: we looked up "swimming with dolphins"and there is a place that has it for 130usd for 90 minutes. But they require you to use a dry suit they provide. And it's doubtful they will have my size
[15:52:49] <Zedronar> The view from the room looks pretty good but otherwise seems ridiculously overpriced.
[15:53:09] <lastonestanding> amigojapan: do you know the youtube channel "Abroad in Japan"?

[17:49:58] <Sapphirus> without c-states
[17:50:10] <Bco1981> Sapphirus: i had mine at 4.3ghz and i think it was 1.4v
[17:50:20] <ButterNoodle> we are already 1/2 dead based on stats

[17:51:03] <emmeka> sure, unification of the channels helped, but we're doing alright
[17:51:12] <ButterNoodle> all it takes is a few morons to be left to irritate the regulars before that has consequences
[17:51:16] <Bco1981> lowered the overclock then it became stabil but after a few months i couldn't even get it to boot a OS locked at base clock

[17:55:34] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, electricity savings would be hard to quantify, no?

[17:57:03] <Bco1981> emmeka: custom water cooling is a lot more expensive, but you can make it cool very well
[17:57:16] <emmeka> Bco1981 is all this water cooling stuff just for CPUs anyway or do you rig it up to GPUs somehow

[17:57:52] <Sapphirus> You also need to maintain it.
[17:58:06] <Bco1981> emmeka: the AIO ones are just for cpu's. the custom water cooling you can add a gpu cooling too. and that will really cool the gpu down.

[18:58:44] <MootPoot> I was blown away I could download anime at the same speed I watched it 
[18:58:48] <MootPoot> It was great 
[18:58:57] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: you in canaderp? 
[18:59:03] <Sapphirus> yes
[18:59:06] <emmeka> many robots were tortured for me to connect to the internet in ye olde days
[18:59:17] <MootPoot> Sadale: I mean dosent hk have fiber everywhere 
[18:59:27] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: shaw
[18:59:30] <Sadale> MootPoot, almost everywhere. Not in my building tho.
[18:59:46] <emmeka> and then you'd be 95% done downloading something after hoooooours of waiting, and someone would need to use the phone ;~;
[18:59:55] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, shaw is whipping robbers, these days.
[19:00:03] <Sadale> MootPoot, I actually find it funny how the buildings like a block away have fiber service. Mine just don't have it. :P
[19:00:11] <MootPoot> Sadale: lol same 
[19:00:21] <Sapphirus> 10/1 ratio isn't bad
[19:00:31] <MootPoot> I'm still on copper but the buildings a block away are fiber 
[19:00:31] <Sapphirus> it's actually quite reasonable for wireline home internet
[19:00:56] <emmeka> one time my ISP called me to say "did you know that you're consistently maxing out upload speed? this might mean that your PC is comprimised"
[19:00:57] <Sadale> MootPoot, anyway I'm mostly happy with my ISP. 100mbps is fast enough to me. And it's real inexpensive. The main problem is the latency tho. Real time gaming just won't work in the recent months. Previously it worked well. :/
[19:01:09] <emmeka> and I was like uhhhhhhhhhhhh I have a uhhhhhhh file server? yes that
[19:01:15] <emmeka> and they were like oh ok have a nice day
[19:01:17] <Sadale> MootPoot, I probably need to get a technician from the internet company to fix that.
[19:01:29] <emmeka> "a file server" otherwise known as "seeding anime"
[19:01:51] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, at least robbers has no data caps
[19:02:28] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: robbers?

[19:04:35] <Sapphirus> TekSavvy and TPIAs we have to thank for that

[19:05:10] <emmeka> I care less about speed and more about the fact that the ISP I have is just a small company that's easy to deal with
[19:05:12] <MootPoot> 25/mo for 25gb of data with unliminted call and text
[19:05:39] <Sapphirus> what the
[19:05:46] <Sapphirus> which carrier
[19:05:54] <Sapphirus> It can't be robellus
[19:05:59] <emmeka> if you call their tech support, the same guy picks up the phone as if you call billing. He's also the guy at the front desk at their offices. His name's Paul.
[19:06:00] <MootPoot> emmeka: in my experience any company that has a online live chat is pretty easy to deal with
[19:06:25] <MootPoot> I hate calling, like every other zoomer out there
[19:06:34] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: nah its just shaw again
[19:06:42] <Sadale> emmeka, I wonder if it's profitable to Paul
[19:06:49] <Sapphirus> oh, yes, so that's why. You can't get anything that cheap here with robellus.
[19:06:52] <MootPoot> I wonder if paul is a capitalist
[19:06:52] <Sadale> emmeka, assuming that he's the boss of the company.
[19:06:54] <emmeka> I'm out there living my dumbphone life, terrorizing the zoomers by making phonecalls
[19:06:59] <Sadale> clearly he is! :P
[19:07:00] <emmeka> Sadale I don't think he is
[19:07:03] <emmeka> he's like my age
[19:07:18] <emmeka> if he is, he's a very successful man
[19:07:22] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: its only within my province though - cant use that 25gb outside and also only if I keep this 1gbit internet plan with them
[19:07:34] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, yeah, phone calls are bleh. I still haven't gotten around to fixing the call functionality on my phone.
[19:07:51] <Sadale> emmeka, I mean, how much money the company would make from 8000 users?
[19:07:55] <Sapphirus> Mainly because I'm a cheapskate and went with VoIP
[19:08:01] <Sapphirus> and the app broke and I didn't bother fixing it
[19:08:14] <emmeka> Sadale like half a million?
[19:08:21] <MootPoot> I can't stop shitting 
[19:08:28] <Sadale> emmeka, per year?
[19:08:31] <emmeka> yeah.
[19:08:38] <Sapphirus> I pay like $15/month with a tablet sim + VoIP service I barely use.
[19:09:02] <Sapphirus> pay-per-use data is far more economical 
[19:09:09] <Sadale> emmeka, 500k CAD per year. That's 400k USD per year 33k per month. freaking 33k only!
[19:09:30] <emmeka> sounds reasonable enough for a small business with few employees
[19:09:34] <Sadale> true
[19:09:34] <Sapphirus> ^^
[19:09:41] <Sadale> Depends on how many employees they've got
[19:10:04] <MootPoot> Jfc
[19:10:14] <MootPoot> Today is a diareeha day 
[19:10:16] <MootPoot> I guess 
[19:10:21] <Sadale> Assuming 33k per year per employee, that fund would only allow them to hire 12 employees.
[19:10:21] <MootPoot> .... 
[19:10:27] <emmeka> sometimes I wonder if I could get the township here to give everyone fibre. it's not impossible. I know for a fact that fibreoptic lines were laid along the railway tracks a decade ago.
[19:10:30] * MootPoot shits on Sadale 
[19:10:32] <Sadale> More than that and they'll be losing money
[19:10:53] <Sapphirus> emmeka, I wish Bell or someone would just run fibre 
[19:11:06] <Sapphirus> They could easily do it here and I wish they would.
[19:11:07] <Sadale> MootPoot, ew
[19:11:10] <MootPoot> emmeka: idk if we have any examples of municipal fiber here outside of bc 
[19:11:14] <emmeka> like the cost of wiring up all the houses within the township wouldn't be absurd, but it'd be beyond the capabilities of any few individuals here
[19:11:29] <Sadale> MootPoot, I got diarrhea like a couple of days ago.
[19:11:36] <MootPoot> Sadale: what did you eat 
[19:11:55] <Sadale> MootPoot, Chongking spicy and sour noodles
[19:12:22] <emmeka> MootPoot well municipal fibre would be nice, but more likely it'd be just getting the township to pay for a fibre hookup to every house in town as a wholesale deal
[19:12:31] <Sadale> MootPoot, Keywords for googling: 重庆酸辣粉
[19:12:41] <emmeka> it nominally runs through the municipality, but without local connections
[19:13:50] <Poeticode> Chattanooga did it best with municipal fiber :D
[19:14:06] <MootPoot> Ffs Shaw only gives static ip to business plans

[19:15:37] <MootPoot> at least 1-2 days at work I'm drowsy and cant pay attention a week
[19:15:51] <Poeticode> wish I could set an alarm that would literally shut my brain off no matter what I'm doing
[19:15:53] <Sadale> Apparently human's biological clock is a bit longer than 24h
[19:16:20] <MootPoot> I think I slept like maybe 5h today
[19:16:23] <Sapphirus> I have a weird sleep phase delay
[19:16:49] <Poeticode> also, blessed are those who can easily nap during the day
[19:16:59] <MootPoot> I cant nap
[19:17:01] <MootPoot> like at all
[19:17:03] <Sapphirus> if I nap during the day, I'll be awake all night and my biological clock is fucked

[19:17:36] <emmeka> MootPoot otoh, smol ISP I deal with has a fixed wireless tower right at the top of the hill. maybe they could be convinced to do fibre through the town to connect to their existing tower?
[19:17:55] <emmeka> if I really cared I could talk to the mayor or show up at council.
[19:18:07] <Sapphirus> It's why I prefer 24-hour time, because my sleep schedule can vary heavily. 
[19:18:12] <MootPoot> maybe, it really depends on what interconnects are being used
[19:18:20] <Sapphirus> Well and that the pedantic part of me hates am/pm
[19:18:26] <MootPoot> there would still probably need some step down equipment
[19:18:46] <MootPoot> and I'm not sure if all of you are up for buying/renting 200 dollar router/modem boxes

[20:22:23] <MootPoot> real kicker for me is the lack of modern codec thingy
[20:22:41] <Bco1981> it's only pcie 4.0 x4
[20:22:59] <MootPoot> sure, but not being able to decode AV1?
[20:22:59] <MootPoot> really
[20:23:33] <Bco1981> hardware unboxed did a pcie bandwidth test and the 4gb ram and the 4x cripples it
[20:23:33] <MootPoot> they made a card so bad maybe not even the miners would want it
[20:23:45] <Bco1981> lol yeah
[20:23:49] <MootPoot> afaik its not the 4x that is the issue
[20:23:56] <MootPoot> its the 64bit bus
[20:24:08] <MootPoot> pcie 4.0x4 is still a LOT for a card like this
[20:24:28] <MootPoot> I remember gtx 1080 ti comparisons at pcie 2 vs 3 and there was like 3% of a difference
[20:24:46] <Bco1981> true, but when you exceed the amount is has it starts to use the system memory, and that's where it hurst
[20:24:49] <Bco1981> hurts*
[20:25:32] <Bco1981> if it had 8gb, it wouldn't have been such a big problem.
[20:26:26] <MootPoot> given everything its a shit card but
[20:26:42] <MootPoot> I still would get it if I was building a 1080p system today

[22:58:48] <K0K1> im glad it doesnt exist
[22:58:49] <Nanobot> This is why I never sign up for premium memberships on any of these shopping cart websites. Instacart's premium service promises to eliminate delivery fees for all orders, for just $99/year. I don't have this membership. My current order: Delivery fee = $3.99. Service fee = $10.01. Extra fee = $1.20. Does premium membership eliminate the service fee or extra fee? No, it does not. And the service fees have been steadily climbing over time.
[22:59:14] * K0K1 dies trying to use their brain to read what Nanobot said
[22:59:25] <thiccdaddy> instacart sucks anyways
[22:59:34] <K0K1> so do catgirls
[22:59:40] <thiccdaddy> catboys are better

[23:00:21] <Bco1981> Extra fee... they can just add anything to that...
[23:00:26] <K0K1> skin as a adjective or a verb? choose your fighter
[23:00:39] <Nanobot> Basically, if I buy premium membership in Instacart and order deliveries of this size every 2 weeks throughout the year (which I don't; I order less than that), I wouldn't get my money's worth out of the membership.
[23:00:43] <thiccdaddy> Nanobot: instacart also hugely fucks over their "contractors" if they get a below 5 star rating
[23:01:01] <thiccdaddy> if they get a below 5 star rating, they can't work big shopping carts anymore, and it's not a livable wage anymore
[23:01:13] <Nanobot> Instacart sucks. Their website is GoDaddy levels of fucking annoying and spammy with "great deals" you don't want.
[23:01:19] <thiccdaddy> yeah

[23:06:20] <K0K1> idk what to do w/ my life
[23:06:32] <Nanobot> "Free" always needs to be in quotes. Somebody is paying for it. For example, my mom once complained to me that some pizza place never had coupons. I told her that introducing coupons would just increase the prices. She couldn't wrap her head around the concept. The business needs to continue making the money they need to continue making. If coupons exist, the business needs to increase prices to offset the loss of profit, plus the additional overhead 
[23:06:32] <Nanobot> involved in creating, distributing, and processing the coupons.
[23:06:35] <thiccdaddy> just pick something you find remotely interesting and give it your best shot and see if it sticks
[23:06:43] <thiccdaddy> that's the secret man, just go out there and do something

[23:10:48] <thiccdaddy> i'd call an A/C tech then

[23:11:02] <Nanobot> The A/C isn't running right now. It's not that.

[23:12:39] <Nanobot> Besides, the last A/C guy I called told me that he'd rather retire than service my HVAC, because it's ancient as hell and has lots of stuff wrong with it, and the job of replacing it is apparently a nightmare because of how my house is. I dunno.

[23:41:57] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: isn't this just going to lead to devaluation of virus particles?
[23:42:12] <HeTo> also, apparently there have been more covid cases within conscripts this year than last year
[23:42:26] <Nanobot> TsundereNoises: I hope so
[23:43:22] <Nanobot> My CEO actually said in a meeting just last week that COVID is "winding down", so we should be thinking of trying to come to the office more. I sent everyone a link to this page and said that I will remain in isolation.
[23:43:33] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: the principal of our school has an interesting take on "test to stay," a kid tested positive but said they didn't feel bad, so they were allowed to stay
[23:43:48] <Nanobot> Ugh
[23:44:14] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: we're the only school in the area that hasn't closed down, despite like 1/3 of the kids being sick, that means we're winning
[23:44:28] <Nanobot> I wonder if it's okay for me to stab someone with a knife as long as I don't feel murderous.
[23:44:32] <TsundereNoises> the most important think is not going remote
[23:44:52] <TsundereNoises> I think it's still assault, but not attempted murder
[23:44:55] <TsundereNoises> so it's less bad
[23:45:09] <TsundereNoises> I don't know how you managed the not feeling murderous thing though

[23:47:03] <Nanobot> Also... WTF kind of messed up child chooses to go to school even though they tested positive with COVID? I would always try to stay home if I so much as missed an hour of sleep.
[23:47:23] * thiccdaddy thinks of all the times he faked being sick
[23:47:40] <thiccdaddy> you've got a golden opportunity to not go to school, and a kid would go to school?
[23:47:41] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: middle school, parents told them to
[23:47:46] <thiccdaddy> oof
[23:47:53] <charlietheloser>  // who the fuck wants to stay at home
[23:47:57] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: very very few of the kids around here are vaccinated, most of the parents aren't either
[23:48:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> charlietheloser: Me.
[23:48:25] <TsundereNoises> but yeah, as a kid I'd have tried my best to stay home just for the sake of not being in school around that age
