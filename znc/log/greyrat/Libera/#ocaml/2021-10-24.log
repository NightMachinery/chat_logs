[16:43:59] <d_bot> <Alistair> I have a background in logic. Are you trying to determine whether a clause contains a pure literal?
[16:46:56] <d_bot> <yanoux> yeah exactly
[16:53:15] <d_bot> <Alistair> What data structure are you using to model clauses? Lists? or Sets?
[16:53:17] *** Quits: mbuf (~Shakthi@223.178.97.156) (Quit: Leaving)
[16:54:06] <d_bot> <yanoux> I‚Äôm using lists

[16:55:20] <d_bot> <yanoux> let exemple_7_8 = [[1;-2;3];[1;-3];[2;3];[1;-2]]
[16:55:45] <d_bot> <yanoux> Here the function pur should return 1
[16:58:29] <d_bot> <Alistair> A naive approach would be to flatten the list of lists, and then iterate through the flattened list, checking the existences of a negative literal for the current literal
[17:02:31] <d_bot> <yanoux> That‚Äôs what i did

[19:46:55] <d_bot> <Et7f3> When you read this documentation:

[19:54:09] <dmbaturin> Last I tried, matrix was unusable.
[19:54:29] <dmbaturin> Earlier this year.
[19:55:14] <reynir> rgrinberg: I'm using it daily since about half a year ago. It works okay for me
[19:55:38] <reynir> I think it could be improved
[19:56:33] <reynir> the bridge with libera.chat works quite well I think
[19:57:13] <rgrinberg> yeah no kidding it can be improved. I think they kind of given up improving it
[19:57:24] <rgrinberg> it's still buggy and horribly slow for me
[19:57:44] <reynir> heh
[19:57:57] <rgrinberg> I'm talking about the electron based client. Perhaps you're using another client

[19:58:11] <rgrinberg> elements
[19:58:33] <reynir> Ah yea, I'm using it in the browser and element on my android phone
[19:58:36] <d_bot> <Et7f3> Why I am asking is because in command https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/cce52acc7c7903e92078e9fe40745e11a1b944f0/parsing/ast_mapper.mli#L18 we see a 'program' so I don't expect arguments https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/cce52acc7c7903e92078e9fe40745e11a1b944f0/driver/pparse.ml#L72 but here Sys.command is called.
