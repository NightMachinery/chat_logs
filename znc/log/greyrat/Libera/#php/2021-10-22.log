[05:45:04] <jargon> For my 1997 QBasic game: "Roe"
[05:46:06] <jargon> The first thing I intend to do is declare virutally all main scope vars as global, and refit all jumps as modules.
[05:46:40] <jargon> This is a tool, not a transpiler.
[05:46:52] <Blondie101010> a tool to transpile is a transpiler
[05:46:56] <Blondie101010> no need to BS
[05:47:14] <jargon> ok
[05:47:14] <Blondie101010> that's what you're doing
[05:47:36] <jargon> Well then, if that is what it is, I must be doing it successfully.
[05:47:57] <Blondie101010> so far it seems like you might be able to get it operational, but it already seems hard to maintain and it's not yet complete
[05:49:38] <jargon> Look at this demo reel: http://puzzlum.net/showcase/vault/Roe2/vods/2021-10-19_15-26-07%20exec11%202%20092%20034%20ok.mp4
[05:50:36] <Blondie101010> it looks like some games I played 30 years ago
[05:51:12] <jargon> it's like a cross between Chess and Gauntlet.
[05:51:32] <Blondie101010> anyways
[05:52:16] <Blondie101010> I can't see why you're still maintaining this, nor why you'd make a transpiler to make it work on a different unpopular platform, all that from PHP

[06:05:27] <jargon> ( per copy )
[06:07:08] <jargon> Roe2 compiles in FreeeBASIC curerntly, but does so without working graphics.
[06:07:22] <jargon> (Due to memory addressing issues)
[06:08:00] <jargon> For some reason it thinks screen 7 is screen 12.
[06:09:30] <Blondie101010> even at 50$ per copy, you can only multiply that by the number of vic 20 owners that are willing to spend money on it, so very little commercial potential

[12:08:12] <Naktibalda> so you want the browser to download rar file and extract it
[12:09:05] <aolko> more like read into it
[12:09:18] <Naktibalda> not a PHP question
[12:09:24] <aolko> once again, like phar can
[12:09:43] <aolko> i'm currently trying phar,zip and rar
[12:10:37] <Blondie101010> aolko:  how do you plan to send it to the front end (client)?
[12:10:39] <aolko> with phar i'm kinda stuck on configuring the stub via box, doesn't want to cooperate with Phar::webPhar
[12:10:48] <Naktibalda> phar file is executable, it can be programed to parse URL and serve static resources
[12:11:27] <Naktibalda> didn't know about webPhar
[12:12:24] <Naktibalda> you can't program rar or zip to handle HTTP requests
[12:12:34] <aolko> Blondie101010, the idea is - drop the assets archive, either replacing the old one or just as new file and then read from it, in case if it can't for some reason - extract it, but extracted dir will be lost during an update
[12:13:33] <aolko> as for Naktibalda - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39679986/php-referencing-static-files-that-is-inside-a-phar-archive-from-html i can't fully relay that config to box
[12:13:56] <Blondie101010> aolko:  you plan to have that running on every request?
[12:15:12] <aolko> well, i guess, ideally there should be an extracted cache with the necessary assets (like styles/js/images/configs), the rest will remain in the archive
[12:17:51] <Blondie101010> would every request need to read the archive?
[12:19:09] *** Joins: de-facto_ (~de-facto@user/de-facto)
[12:19:16] <aolko> only ones that request from the archive, since when we are requesting assets we are reading assets from the archive
[12:19:39] <Blondie101010> that's unclear
[12:19:40] <aolko> think important appdata that users shouldn't be touching
[12:19:56] <aolko> like configs, styles, js scripts
[12:19:57] *** Quits: de-facto (~de-facto@user/de-facto) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[12:20:02] <Blondie101010> isn't this a web site/app?
[12:20:12] <aolko> it's a self-hosted app
[12:20:32] <Blondie101010> does "self-hosted" involve magic?
[12:20:48] <Blondie101010> what's the web server?
[12:21:23] <aolko> so the point is we have compressed assets that users shouldn't touch and assets placed openly that they can touch
[12:21:31] <aolko> apache+nginx proxy
[12:22:03] *** de-facto_ is now known as de-facto
[12:22:26] <aolko> apache 2.4 + php8.0 + nginx 1.21 to be specific
[12:22:29] <Blondie101010> I know little of your project, but so far you seem to be making things very complicated and slow for nothing
[12:22:52] <Blondie101010> assets should not go through php
[12:23:26] <aolko> that's why i'm only exploring compressed assets, usually they would out in the open located in their respective folders
[12:23:39] <aolko> and anyone can edit those
[12:23:44] <Blondie101010> why don't you let the web server do its job?
[12:24:01] <Blondie101010> what?  people can edit files on your web server?
[12:24:16] <aolko> because since it's self-hosted nobody prevents users from going to the domain dir and editing the assets
[12:24:33] <Blondie101010> omg, get a sysadmin
[12:25:02] <Blondie101010> for immediate assistance go to your webserver support and tell them that
[12:25:12] <aolko> for an embedded self-hosted app? yeah...right
[12:25:20] <Blondie101010> what do you mean?
[12:25:25] <Blondie101010> you said nginx and apache
[12:25:34] <aolko> embedded in a sense that it comes with configured LANMP stack
[12:25:48] <Blondie101010> you need to act now if this is online!
[12:25:52] <Blondie101010> take it offine
[12:25:57] <aolko> think something like xaamp or wamp or ospanel or caddy
[12:26:08] <Blondie101010> is it online?
[12:26:39] <Blondie101010> if people can edit stuff on it, you have a MAJOR problem
[12:26:51] <aolko> it's configured to be open only to the local network, so unless user configures the ip and ports it can be considered offline
[12:27:00] <Blondie101010> ok good for that
[12:27:06] <Blondie101010> but your setup is bad
[12:27:14] <aolko> and when i said people can edit stuff i meant people __who own the server and spin it__
[12:27:24] <aolko> on their machine
[12:27:24] <Blondie101010> hmm that is normal
[12:27:42] <Blondie101010> there's no protection against stupidity
[12:27:55] <aolko> true, but i still would prefer assets to be zipped or encrypted to prevent tinkering
[12:28:15] <aolko> and obfuscating those individually is a pain esp between updates
[12:28:53] <Blondie101010> there's absolutely no way I would justify spending 5-10 times more time and making the app much harder to support, and much slower, for those reasons
[12:28:57] <Blondie101010> it makes no sens

[12:30:22] <aolko> sure, but how else i'm going to "lock" the assets

[12:30:51] <Blondie101010> not if they're on the client's machine
[12:31:11] <aolko> or at least make them easier to update for distrib sake
[12:31:28] <Blondie101010> you make an installer or updater
[12:31:59] <aolko> surprisingly, that's not a very widely covered, documented topic
[12:32:33] <Blondie101010> just do it like most...  you make a really simple web page with a few buttons to do the update
[12:32:38] <Eugen80> I'm reviewing code, I see this: public function someMethod(): ResponseInterface {} .. and in code I see simple "return;" Is it a problem?
[12:32:49] <aolko> (and some if not most of the installer/updater tutorials are horribly dated)
[12:33:09] <aolko> sure, i can pull that off
[12:33:11] <Blondie101010> Eugen80:  we can't know just like that :)
[12:33:18] <Blondie101010> Eugen80:  but that returns null

[21:07:27] <Blondie101010> or count
[21:07:50] <hansol> it does
[21:08:05] <Blondie101010> 20 char limit
[21:08:08] <Blondie101010> that's what it does
[21:08:10] <hansol> the character number
[21:08:17] <hansol> i have test it it works
[21:08:37] <Blondie101010> all you do is blindly copy code and expect it to be close to what you want
[21:08:42] <Blondie101010> that is NOT what you asked for
[21:09:18] <hansol> i have max 34 characters added in settings, and i cant se more than 34 in title
[21:10:08] <Blondie101010> how you do it is up to you, but I strongly suggest you stop copy pasting things you can't write on your own, meaning you *should* understand why it does what it does precisely
[21:10:26] <hansol> that is correct

[21:27:08] <biberu> hansol: note that the advice in that post may end up corrupting multi byte characters
[21:27:43] <hansol> you mean ... ? at the end??
[21:28:26] <Rockwood> biberu, o/
[21:29:00] <biberu> hansol: how is your text encoded? UTF-8?
[21:30:25] <biberu> hansol: if it's unicode you can't just cut like that, you've got to take care not to corrupt or alter the appearance/meaning of the text
[21:31:16] <hansol> its unicode
[21:31:30] <biberu> hansol: some characters are encoded as multiple bytes, and some codepoints combine
[21:31:45] <hansol> so  what is better to put at the end
[21:31:55] <biberu> substr is fundamentally broken for that use case
[21:32:09] <Blondie101010> biberu:  please don't give a complete solution
[21:32:19] <hansol> i was thinkink about »
[21:32:58] <biberu> hansol: can you solve it with css?
