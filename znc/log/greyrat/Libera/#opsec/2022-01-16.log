[02:14:49] <Joanna> inky_: It seems that people who like to explore either physically or mentally are a small minority of population
[02:16:32] <jan6> obviously
[02:17:07] <jan6> if they weren't a minority, we wouldn't have big cities, but rather a big network of smaller towns and stuff
[02:25:27] <Joanna> jan6: I saw video about videos on YouTube aimed at unattended children clicking on videos
[02:25:46] <jan6> of course
[02:26:02] <jan6> kids are dumb, and trolls are everywhere
[02:26:15] <jan6> some more nefarious than others
[02:26:46] <Joanna> They are trying to traumatize kids for a reason
[02:27:13] <jan6> there is no reason
[02:27:14] <Joanna> Parents should not use computers as a babysitter
[02:27:30] <jan6> that, too, of course
[02:27:39] <Joanna> There is always a reason
[02:27:58] <jan6> there is rarely a reason
[02:28:02] <jan6> for ANYTHING
[02:28:18] <jan6> and there is never a reason if you go deep enough
[02:28:56] <Joanna> There is a reason for existence itself just because you don’t know the reason doesn’t mean there is no reason
[02:29:00] <jan6> e.g. "why is sky blue?" "oxygen" "but why does oxygen scatter light specifically in a way we percieve as blue, and not any other?"
[02:30:09] <Joanna> The perception of reality is formed in our minds
[02:31:25] <jan6> but what even IS reality?
[02:32:38] <Joanna> I don’t like it when people just dismiss things without investigating them . Like crime for instance. The investigation ends very quickly with blaming someone and that’s that.

[03:08:09] <jan6> of cours
[03:08:30] <Joanna> And it’s not the people actually committing the crimes in the news
[03:08:43] <jan6> depends what news and what crimes
[03:08:59] <jan6> and who got hit with the crime
[03:09:38] <jan6> news prioritize their content a LOT, based on what they think will get people to watch/read/buy them more
[03:10:01] <Joanna> There is a large industry of billions of dollars that has an interest in crime as we know it not going away
[03:10:35] <jan6> depends what crime
[03:10:54] <Joanna> News media is definitely profiting from crime
[03:11:02] <jan6> not really
[03:11:05] <jan6> it's selective
[03:11:17] <jan6> there's no point in putting in "this random person got stabbed to death" every week, it just gets boring
[03:11:47] <Joanna> Are you kidding? Every horrific event gets them more viewers
[03:12:08] <jan6> it's put in news if there's a point, e.g. "how tragic, he was only 14", or "the nephew of this celebrity killed a man, can you believe that!"
[03:12:40] <jan6> or "hundreds of people died, on to next news"

[03:13:02] <Joanna> The random person being stabbed to death garners support for entire justice system
[03:13:35] <jan6> nobody cares to make news of "approximately X people died yesterday, in united states"
[03:13:41] <jan6> beause it's not catchy enough
[03:14:05] <jan6> it's all a game of getting attention and mind-share
[03:14:43] <Joanna> Yes they do people are scared and want police and courts to stop criminals
[03:15:22] <jan6> nobody cares to put into news that "an unknown killer killed a random person who worked at mcdonalds, while they were walking home, we have no more info"
[03:15:57] <jan6> there needs to be an interesting bit, for it to be worth it
[03:16:14] <Joanna> That’s because the public is scared enough to not want to get rid of justice system
[03:16:27] <jan6> justice system is *JUSTICE* system
[03:17:39] <jan6> without it, the alternative would be "require fanning up a hate mob for any punishment"
[03:21:27] <Joanna> I know it’s hard to believe but people have lived just fine with the justice system in many places. Do you think Eskimos has police and prisons?
[03:22:10] <jan6> no, because they were small enough population, in extreme enough places, where if you dicked around, you just DIED
[03:22:51] <jan6> also eskimo is the derogatory term, anyway
[03:22:51] <Joanna> Children were not presented with the idea of being a criminal
[03:23:01] <Joanna> Inuits
[03:23:20] <jan6> they weren't, because it made no sense, as I said
[03:23:50] <jan6> if you did something bad, you'd just be thrown out of the community, and good luck surviving alone, though the extreme weather and scarce resources
[03:24:51] <Joanna> Exactly and modern people don’t have control of their communities and it’s no accident
[03:24:54] <jan6> also there was no money, or precious things, in their culture
[03:25:37] <jan6> you sure they don't?
[03:26:17] <jan6> because most people do, for the most part... of course, still has to follow the laws of the place it's located at, too

[03:27:03] <Joanna> American Indians on reservations can’t control their own people
[03:27:33] <jan6> controlling people, is one thing, being free to do anything, is another
[03:27:56] <Joanna> Crime is advertised and glorified non stop in media
[03:27:58] <jan6> also control is two-sided, you can't control someone who doesn't want to be controlled
[03:28:04] <jan6> in your media, yes
[03:28:23] <jan6> it all depends what sort of media you consume, and where
[03:29:15] <jan6> over here, there is no such thing as violence in media, generally, partly because there's not much crime, either, and mostly because people don't care about it
[03:29:22] <Joanna> It’s not hard to throw people out of a town for bad behavior but people are not allowed to they will get in trouble with justice system
[03:29:47] <jan6> depends on specifics, and as I said, laws still apply
[03:30:06] <Joanna> And everyone in the justice system wants to keep their jobs
[03:30:12] <jan6> there are *SOME* exemptions for the native americans, but they still have to follow other laws
[03:31:08] <jan6> if you don't want justice systems, just go out to international waters, create your own community, and start a new nation ;P
[03:31:18] <Joanna> Exactly therefore they have a lot of crime
[03:31:46] <jan6> or try to support Sealand, or something
[03:32:25] <Joanna> Justice systems don’t prevent crime they feed on crime
[03:32:47] <jan6> which is a micronation that's KINDA there, but not officially recognized, basically just an oil platform, iirc, which was colonized by some pirates, who then set up camp, and even fought off an invasion
[03:33:09] <jan6> justice systems don't prevent crime, because they cannot, they only punish
[03:34:05] <jan6> and it's all up to a human's decision (for now), with all their internal biases, even if they want to be as fair as they can
[03:34:59] <jan6> there's always bad people around, especially higher up in power structures, but that doesn't mean the entire system is bad
[03:35:09] <jan6> because your ideal world is impossible
[03:35:40] <jan6> if you want it to be real, you could try to start off with a virtual world, as a proof of concept
[03:36:35] <jan6> a world without moderators, or admin-intervention, where you can show how "just normal people" can handle everything
[03:37:11] <jan6> because that's just not possible with big communities
[03:38:00] <jan6> only small communities are able to self-govern, without needing enforcement people
[03:39:13] <jan6> in a small group, everyone is a little bit of everything, but the larger it gets, the more specialized organs start to form, "people who get resources" "people who use resources" "people who decide what should be done with the resources" and whatnot

[03:57:16] <Joanna> Nobody cares about preventing crime? Where are all the criminals coming from ? Nobody cares
[04:02:04] <inky> according to steven pinker, crime levels, violence levels are constantly going down. since the emerging of leviathan, the state.
[04:02:34] <inky> described in a very interesting way in his book 'better angels of our nature'
[04:02:55] <inky> he also has good interviews, let's nay one with joe rogan.
[04:03:14] <inky> but i guess rogan removed most of old videos on youtube.

[04:35:31] <jan6> did you not read the sentence? or do you not parse english well? "emerging of leviathan, the state" refers to the state, as the leviathan
[04:37:32] <Joanna> That depends upon how you define crime I guess the state can rob and murder the entire population if it wants to and it won’t be a crime

[05:13:12] <jan6> average doesn't care if there's a few highs among the lows
[05:14:24] <jan6> if you took the average amount of people killed intentionally, per person, for the whole world, then that'd probably be a fraction of a person, but that doesn't mean there aren't people who've killed hundreds
[05:15:46] <jan6> also I know I had to specify "intentionally" because otherwise you'd argue that many would kill indirectly by supporing the people who do the killing by proxy
