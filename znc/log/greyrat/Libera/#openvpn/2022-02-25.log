[01:10:12] <clarkk> rob0, the service provider said this, "In the ovpn config, please lower the mssfix value to 25 and try connecting again"
[01:10:21] <clarkk> That's 58 times lower than the default setting!
[01:15:11] <rob0> 25
[01:16:35] <rob0> that sounds nuts to me.  See "--mssfix" in the man page.
[01:19:23] <clarkk> I guess that's the initial value that will work in all situations, but is not optimum.  They haven't yet told me how to find the optimum value
[01:20:25] <clarkk> But I'm curious that I found a possible solution online involving mssfix, but you all said my issue wasn't anything to do with it, but then this is the first thing that the provider suggested
[01:40:13] <clarkk> setting it to 25 didn't solve it.  tbh, the provider is clueless.
[01:41:20] <clarkk> I'm sure some of their tech staff would know, but I can't get past first line support
[01:41:58] <rob0> I wouldn't be so sure.
