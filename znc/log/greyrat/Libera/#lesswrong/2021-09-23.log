[00:11:57] <shawwwn> So I wake up preparing to face my ruined new window
[00:12:34] <shawwwn> I go into the bedroom, old window still there. I was like “did they leave?”

[00:25:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> (That's the entirety of the answer)
[00:26:22] <kuudes> I agree that answer sounds like an old school babble generator
[00:27:02] <saturn2> kuudes: i'd guess in most cases it's because the owners minds are occupied with other things
[00:27:28] <kuudes> ... but if you have brownouts and blackouts for months per year, surely that is a top priority for you to solve?
[00:27:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> It turns out that it is not
[00:28:59] <kuudes> I mean, I am considering on if I should buy a powerwall just to work as ups even though we don't generally ever have blackouts here and it seems unlikely it would save its cost from electricity price trading

David Humbird,

In an extensive series of interviews with The Counter, he said it was “hard to find an angle that wasn’t a ludicrous dead end.” Humbird likened the process of researching the
[02:01:50] <feepbot> report to encountering an impenetrable “Wall of No”—his term for the barriers in thermodynamics, cell metabolism, bioreactor design, ingredient costs, facility construction, and other factors that will need to be overcome before cultivated protein can be produced cheaply enough to displace traditional meat. “And it’s a fractal no,” he told me. “You see the big no, but

[04:00:28] <ivan> 46.7% are in the top 25% of intelligence
[04:00:28] <feepbot> What an absolute bang up job latitude : AIDungeon (44 votes and 13 comments so far on Reddit)
[04:01:27] <ivan> 19.5% - going to public school is a greater violation of consent 
[04:02:10] <ivan> 89.1% - yes can hold opposite views and be kind
[04:02:31] <gwern> (I waffled on that. I think going to public school is a vastly greater usurpation of your autonomy, but I also think that a lot of the PTSD and trauma of rape is because of how our culture now treats rape as the ultimate sin and destroyer of lives which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy so the sex actually would be more harmful)
[04:03:24] <ivan> 7% yes, unsexy / 7% no, / 3.4% never seen this
[04:03:39] <catern> gwern: yeah but the question is about violation of consent, not which is more harmful
[04:04:04] <catern> i'm sad i voted wrong on 80% yellow question
[04:04:35] <ivan> 60.1% press the button to never be hungry
[04:04:41] <ivan> seems optimal
[04:04:56] <catern> well if you're never hungry you miss out on the best seasoning
[04:05:16] <gwern> catern: because we put sexual autonomy on *such* a pedestal, it actually does become much more serious than losing the best years of your life - because you will be taught and culturally brainwashed to agonize over the sexual violation for all the rest of the years of your life
[04:05:18] <ivan> the question doesn't indicate that you'd be unable to eat at all
[04:05:44] <catern> ivan: I mean as in "hunger is the best seasoning"
[04:05:51] <ivan> 70.7% prefer to undo feminism instead of capitalism
[04:05:57] <catern> if you were always in a satiated state I think you'd enjoy food less
[04:06:06] <catern> so it's not completely free
[04:06:36] <catern> gwern: uh, yeah... but the question is about violation of consent (which IMO doesn't have anything to do with the consequences), not which is more harmful
[04:06:56] <gwern> where else are you getting the importance of consent and the magnitude of what is consented to from?
[04:07:08] <gwern> do you have some consentometer you can wave at these acts divorced of the consequences?
[04:07:21] <catern> natural rights?
[04:07:51] <gwern> as natural rights are madeup and nonsense on stilts, I can make up an imaginary natural right about sex which is bigger than one about schooling just as easily as you can do the reverse
[04:08:43] <catern> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ this is just my reading of the question, that it's strictly about the concept of consent
[04:09:20] <saturn2> what does a greater violation of consent even mean?
[04:09:54] <catern> saturn2: briefly touching someone is less of a violation than tackling them?
[04:10:12] <catern> look I'm just going off my intuition here
[04:11:00] <saturn2> also it doesn't say rape, it says sex
[04:12:33] <gwern> ah, but such young girls by definition can't consent thus it is always rape :)
[04:12:56] <catern> also never said girl, you pedo
[04:14:02] <gwern> you mean, cishet scum
[04:16:56] <ivan> only 9.4% would 'Yes, definitely' vote for Jeff Bezos
[04:17:23] <ivan> 21.7% yes maybe / 27.3% no I don't think so / 41.6% absolutely not

[06:47:10] <gwern> quanticle: sakura is a pretty subtle taste. maybe they're using too little
[06:47:29] <rmmh> the long tail is pretty pathetic
[06:47:47] <rmmh> someone that had 25 views on wikipedia in 2020 that died of covid? yeah, certainly has to be in the list
[06:47:51] <gwern> I notice that most of them are old as dirt
[06:48:03] <rmmh> kind of how covid works, isn't it? :)
[06:48:26] <rmmh> there's some wikidata api to get ages, right?
[06:48:38] <gwern> yes, but it's striking how there's still no super-famous young outlier at the top of the list
[06:48:52] <gwern> this isn't a random sample, after all
[06:49:03] <gwern> you'd expect some beloved youtuber
[06:49:13] <rmmh> I'm holding out for some pregnant influencer dying
[06:49:26] <rmmh> best (worst) odds for a young person to die
[06:49:26] <catern> rmmh should scrape age and put that on the list
[06:50:02] <catern> but, fame (or at least wikipedia page views) are pretty correlated with age anyway
[06:50:11] <rmmh> I don't think that's true
[06:50:41] <gwern> one conclusion I am drawing from this is that covid mortality isn't going to affect future culture all that much. it's basically killing only really old people whose careers are long over or were obscure. this is a striking contrast to spanish influenza, eg, which killed young people and so we'll never know who we lost

[06:53:52] <gwern> indeed. although people tend to think only about WWI and forget that spanish influenza took out just as many young men
[06:55:44] <rmmh> catern: find me a good api to get age from a wikipedia article and I will
[06:56:08] <rmmh> grabbing the full page text is lame and expensive
[06:57:22] <catern> is there a mapping between wikipedia articles and wikidata? surely wikidata has age
[06:57:45] <gwern> wikidata surely has birth/death which you can compute age from
[06:58:04] <rmmh> it does, I just don't know the api given a wikipedia page title

[07:35:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Aubrey Vogel, a journalism major at Texas A&M, has had similar experiences to Drossman. She’s encountered directory structure before; she shared a computer with her grandfather, who showed her how to save items in folders, as a child. But as she’s grown up, she’s moved away from that system — she now keeps one massive directory for schoolwork and one for her job. Documents she’s not sure about go in a third folder

[07:41:53] <adiabatic> I'm starting to think that the spatial finder might be a mental crippler because minor nerds access files through non-finder means (Shortcuts, the Terminal)

[07:45:00] <Obormot\Arcturus>  because Instagram is poorly designed, like all social media webshit

[07:47:05] <adiabatic> much better mental stance to have
[07:48:21] <adiabatic> Oddly enough, I use folders as search names. When I want to go to this particular project's folder, I just type in "test images" to get to the relevant test-images directory with a bunch of pictures of chickens and then I back up one level

[08:25:38] <quanticle> Yeah, I graduated college debt free. No housing costs. Minimal food costs. I had an efficient car, so I didn't have to pay very much for gas. Literally, as long as I could hold down my programming internship, I could make enough (barely) to cover tuition and books.
[08:25:48] <rmmh> I like reading contradictory dating sites for drama-- unfortunately reddit banned MGTOW, but it was fun to read those back-to-back with FDS
[08:26:17] <rmmh> I graduated college with ~$70k of debt, but wasn't very worried because CS
[08:26:27] <quanticle> But in retrospect, having 19 credits in a semester and a job was possibly not the best idea
[08:26:41] <quanticle> But whatever, I survived
[08:27:02] <adiabatic> you survived, so you didn't tank your grades too much, and you got into a FAANG
[08:27:06] <rmmh> powerful https://twitter.com/bravemule/status/1440809004532260877
[08:27:07] <|dbotdan> Kevin Snow (@bravemule, 2021-09-22 22:43): ‘one time tarn adams told me that he uses twitter by opening it, scrolling really fast until he sees a picture of an animal, favs it, then closes the app. I think he solved a mystery no one else has.’
[08:27:20] <quanticle> adiabatic: No, I tanked the grades pretty hard
[08:27:28] <quanticle> I didn't get into a FAANG immediately after college
[08:27:40] <adiabatic> oh, and I forgot there's no M in FAANG
[08:27:52] <quanticle> No, I was at Amazon, too, remember?
[08:28:00] <adiabatic> no, I forgot that too
[08:28:10] <quanticle> I just meant that it took me like 4 years bumming around various local web dev things
[08:28:20] <quanticle> And then I passed the Amazon interview
[08:28:37] <quanticle> My undergrad GPA is 2.89
[08:29:15] <quanticle> The grades were tanked *pretty hard*
[08:29:41] <quanticle> Which is lol because *even to this day* my mom's like, "You know, you could still go back to grad school"
[08:30:29] <quanticle> And I'm like, lmao, I have a 2.89 GPA, no professors remember me (because of the job and the fact that I was a commuter student), I have no research, and... okay what?
[08:30:30] <rmmh> my GPA tanked when I moved out of the dorm and had a depression studio apartment and didn't see anyone
[08:34:28] <Ralith> why would you go to grad school regardless of GPA
[08:35:57] <quanticle> Because, and this is a literal quote from my mom, "All the girls I've found for you have masters' degrees. Are you seriously going to be less educated than your wife?"
[08:36:04] <PapuaHardyNet> so your parents can brag about it
[08:36:45] <adiabatic> we need a brown yeschad.jpg
[08:36:53] <quanticle> PapuaHardyNet: That's an oversimplification, see my comment above
[08:36:56] <PapuaHardyNet> wow quanticle, you are from a rather conservative family
[08:37:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol
[08:37:05] <rmmh> PapuaHardyNet: his mom keeps trying to arrange a marriage lol
[08:37:07] <PapuaHardyNet> not saying it is bad, just surprising
[08:37:14] <quanticle> The weird thing is, my family is fairly liberal as far as Indian families go
[08:37:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: This is called "immigrant intelligentsia"
[08:37:24] <rmmh> it's ok, we're all rationalists here, we can call it bad
[08:37:35] <adiabatic> I don't think it's bad
[08:37:44] <PapuaHardyNet> naw, I lean conservative culturally in many ways
[08:38:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> American conservatives are like, baby conservatives
[08:38:09] <adiabatic> I probably wouldn't get married if I didn't have family trying to arrange one for me…and I sure as hell don't, and for some reason Miss Right isn't falling from the sky
[08:39:01] <quanticle> Let's put it this way: your odds of finding Miss Right don't escalate appreciably *with* family trying to arrange one for you... unless you're basically all aboard the normie train
[08:39:16] <quanticle> And if you were all aboard the normie train, you wouldn't need the help in the first place
[08:39:47] <adiabatic> I probably can't be all aboard the normie train but I wish I were
[08:40:33] <rmmh> it's ok you can learn emotional intelligence by osmosis as your wife teachers your toddler how to navigate feelings
[08:40:44] <quanticle> I guess that's the difference between you and me. You're standing at the station, looking wistfully at the normie train as it leaves. I'm the anarachist accelerationist planting a bomb under the first bridge the train'll cross
[08:41:22] <saturn2> i thought the whole benefit of arranged marriages was that you didn't have to like each other
[08:41:22] <PapuaHardyNet> wut. you can't destroy normiedom. it is like a cockroach
[08:41:41] <quanticle> PapuaHardyNet: Are you kidding? Normiedom is already mostly destroyed
[08:41:59] <PapuaHardyNet> what is your definition of normiedom?
[08:42:21] <quanticle> Between Fox News, the New York Times and Facebook, we have taken the war to the normies and are prosecuting it with *great* success
[08:43:11] <quanticle> Inshallah we will drive them from our hallowed Internet or convert them to being weird
[08:43:33] <PapuaHardyNet> if it is normie it isn't weird
[08:44:52] <adiabatic> nah, we've flipped. remember how google was worried about what happens when over 50% of the videos on youtube are spam?
[08:45:23] <adiabatic> we're like that, but for weirdoes/normies in the US, at least for the people who seem to control the domestic institutions
[08:45:34] <quanticle> Look, all I'm saying is that we have white suburban moms, who, probably only a few years ago were leading perfectly ordinary lives, like taking their kids to school or whatever, going off at school board meetings about critical race theory because they got infected by a mind virus off Facebook. If that isn't a victory against normies, I don't know what is
[08:47:13] <saturn2> if you go to school board meetings you're still 100% normie, i don't care what you read on facebook
[08:47:29] <quanticle> Hard disagree
[08:47:35] <quanticle> Have you been to a school board meeting?
[08:47:42] <saturn2> no
[08:47:48] <PapuaHardyNet> you haven't won. you have simply watched as the sanity waterline has been reduced.
[08:48:07] <saturn2> normie doesn't imply sane
[08:48:52] <adiabatic> nancy grace bleating about a missing white woman or duke lacrosse players gone wild? normie, not sane
[08:49:10] <quanticle> Yeah, normie implies doing whatever the normal is in society. Like, lets put it this way: I'm the sort of person who reads https://www.gwern.net/The-Melancholy-of-Subculture-Society and says, "Yes, more of that please"
[08:49:10] <Robomot> The Melancholy of Subculture Society · Gwern.net (Internet links small groups, helping dissolve big groups; good, bad? But a bit sad.)
[08:49:40] <quanticle> And, so far, society has delivered
[08:50:27] <PapuaHardyNet> you want society to fragment as much as possible?
[08:50:47] <PapuaHardyNet> what's your endgame?

[09:05:44] <PapuaHardyNet> normies are the world eaters
[09:07:19] <feep[work]> invasion of the 50f normie
[09:07:23] <quanticle> saturn2: So what you're saying is that when all those extremely online channers brought Pepe to Trump rallies, there were being eaten rather the ones doing the eating?
[09:08:45] <feep[work]> of course
[09:09:00] <saturn2> yes
[09:10:13] <quanticle> Hmmm
[09:10:19] <quanticle> I'm not sure I agree
[09:10:33] <PapuaHardyNet> 4channers are normies
[09:10:46] <quanticle> Yeah, no
[09:11:00] <feep[work]> They Live Among Us
[09:11:13] <quanticle> If your definition of "normie" includes 4Chan, then it's so expansive as to be useless
[09:11:29] <PapuaHardyNet> depends on chan. /lgbt/, /soc/, and /fit/ are normies for sure
[09:11:40] <quanticle> Still disagree
[09:11:51] <feep[work]> "The billboard said 'OBEY' and 'CONSUME', a fact which Frank found very sus."
[09:11:56] <quanticle> A "normie" in my mind thinks "Four Chan" is the name of a Chinese person
[09:12:15] <PapuaHardyNet> ugh, your definition of a normie is a better one, I agree.
[09:12:29] <PapuaHardyNet> but it shouldn't apply to people under the age of 25
[09:12:40] <nshepperd2> most people under 25 are normies
[09:12:44] <quanticle> feep[work]: Did he think it was "sussy baka uwu"
[09:12:56] <PapuaHardyNet> exactly, which is why you need to take into account discord and 4chan users
[09:12:58] <saturn2> a normie is just someone who is not alienated from mainstream society
[09:13:25] <adiabatic> uh…/lgbt/? normie?
[09:13:47] <feep[work]> quanticle: I feel you are not comprehending how clever the joke is
[09:14:06] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, I haven't really viewed /lgbt/ all that well. It seemed normie a few years ago when I browsed it once
[09:14:15] <quanticle> feep[work]: I'm too normie to get the joke
[09:14:23] <rmmh> is discord normie 
[09:14:24] <quanticle> I don't actually play amogus
[09:14:27] <adiabatic> also /out/ seems way more normie than /fit/. I've never bothered browsing /lgbt/ because why
[09:14:29] <PapuaHardyNet> discord has to be normie
[09:14:38] <adiabatic> discord is pretty normie now
[09:14:45] <quanticle> I think it depends on the server, no?
[09:15:01] <PapuaHardyNet> that's obvious
[09:15:02] <adiabatic> Discord, Inc. is normie
[09:15:08] <adiabatic> they got rid of their pisscorp logo
[09:15:08] <feep[work]> quanticle: they live among us = they live (OBEY, CONSUME) + among us (sus)

[09:15:38] <feep[work]> okay, maybe it was not as clever as I thought
[09:15:39] <adiabatic> rmmh: not me, wikipedia pages don't have dark mode
[09:15:43] <quanticle> But regardless of the normieness of Discord, I think we can all agree that IRC is *not* Normie
[09:15:53] <adiabatic> agreed
[09:16:05] <rmmh> There used to be kids on irc 
[09:16:12] <feep[work]> for any definition of normie, everyone can agree that they at least are not in it
[09:16:16] <feep[work]> it follows that normies do not exist
[09:16:26] <rmmh> I haven't seen a teen join any of the channels I'm in in years now 
[09:16:47] <adiabatic> I was a teenager on IRC once
[09:16:51] <feep[work]> same
[09:16:57] <rmmh> I learned to type on irc 
[09:17:02] <feep[work]> rmmh: places grow up with the people in them
[09:17:13] <nshepperd2> the torah is unclear on whether irc is normie
[09:17:18] <rmmh> feep[work]: yes, but there was a steady influx of users for a long time

[09:17:33] <feep[work]> we need to pay eliezer to write more fanfic
[09:17:55] <feep[work]> shit, is anime fandom aging
[09:17:57] <feep[work]> that'd be terrible
[09:18:03] <rmmh> a 13yo that wants to chat about video games isn't going to connect to quakenet 
[09:18:20] <feep[work]> eh, don't underestimate the pull of nerddom
[09:18:22] <rmmh> given anime demographics I doubt it's really aging 
[09:18:42] <feep[work]> I'm in this community because I read the tales of the hackers who came before me and decided I wanted to be part of them
[09:18:44] <rmmh> target demographics at least 
[09:19:10] <feep[work]> in a very direct way, I'm a nerd because of esr and the hacker's dictionary.
[09:19:35] <feep[work]> so like ... all I'm saying is, to a certain people, nerd-dom is cool and enticing.
[09:19:36] <saturn2> western anime fandom is probably aging
[09:19:48] <quanticle> rmmh: Yeah, one of my old co-workers had an anecdote about that. He volunteered at anime conventions, because, according to him, after a certain age, being a volunteer or a presenter is the only way you can go to anime conventions and not look like a total creeper
[09:19:58] <feep[work]> quanticle: what
[09:20:01] <feep[work]> that seems like a him problem
[09:20:33] <feep[work]> alternate take: "yeah because before that age you have no 'I am a creeper' sense"
[09:20:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Why not just f.lux darkroom mode
[09:21:16] * saturn2 concludes that feep is a creeper
[09:21:21] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: too lazy to hold down the home button and say "hey Siri, turn on smart invert" or whatever the fuck it is
[09:21:27] <feep[work]> saturn2: no, I'm a loser
[09:21:29] <feep[work]> get it straight
[09:21:49] <PapuaHardyNet> luser
[09:21:51] <feep[work]> creepers are losers with hope
[09:22:36] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: also darkroom mode didn't work on macOS last I checked, I haven't run f.lux in years, and darkroom mode with lots of dark windows is not a fun time
[09:22:51] <quanticle> Yes, feep makes dumb noises to let you know he's about to attack you as opposed to silently sneaking up on you and DESTROYING YOUR HOPES AND DREA... okay this isn't Minecraft
[09:23:05] <feep[work]> I definitely emit barks

[09:30:23] <feep[work]> quanticle: yes, that's sort of my point.
[09:31:21] <quanticle> No, but don't you see: if Technoviking is a creeper, what hope is there for you?
[09:31:40] <feep[work]> quanticle: that's my point!

[09:31:55] <quanticle> I see
[09:32:33] <feep[work]> :3
[09:32:54] <quanticle> Also: "yeah, hope that they can not look like a total pedo at an anime con HEYO"
[09:33:47] <feep[work]> I do not understand why people would care about this.
[09:34:30] <quanticle> Some people are really into that scene and it sucks for them when they age out of it
[09:34:46] <quanticle> Relatedly some people liked being in high school
[09:34:54] <feep[work]> but that's a weird thing, isn't it? like, I can't imagine "aging out" of programming
[09:34:57] <feep[work]> like, hiring, sure
[09:35:08] <rmmh> I aged out of anime, AMA
[09:35:12] <feep[work]> but ... like, if I'm in a programmer channel where half the people are teens

[09:36:53] <rmmh> realizing that my harem fantasies were even more unrealistic than I thought when I got in a relationship and saw how much effort it was certainly didn't help

[09:38:21] <Obormot\Gaia> Hm, _How Much For Just The Planet?_ is not as good as _The Final Reflection_
[09:38:43] <feep[work]> that's why you organize your harem to be a poly graph rather than a star network
[09:38:54] <feep[work]> so that the star character can actually do other things than harem maintenance sometime some day
[09:39:05] <Obormot\Gaia> Organize your harem as a token ring network

[09:43:36] <rmmh> I think the last thing I read was Jin, which is about a time traveling surgeon
[09:43:41] <feep[work]> ngnl is basically .... I'm gonna say something mildly heretical
[09:43:45] <nshepperd2> i thought it was a fight to the death or something
[09:44:03] <feep[work]> it's the weeaboo version of worth the candle

[09:45:12] <feep[work]> it's honestly amazing, I have never felt so understood, season 2 when (I know it's never, lemme dream)

[09:46:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because it is bad.

[09:46:39] <feep[work]> well, if you like reading rationalfic, yes
[09:46:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Several of his fics are worth reading

[09:48:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wales's best stuff was:
[09:48:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> 1. "A Bluer Shade of White"

[09:48:33] <feep[work]> er
[09:48:33] <feep[work]> yes
[09:48:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2. "The Metropolitan Man"
[09:48:49] <quanticle> Okay, I've read Metropolitan Man
[09:49:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Instruments of Destruction" was good for a sensible chuckle or two
[09:49:04] <quanticle> That was cool, and also not not tediously long
[09:49:26] <feep[work]> oyeah that was great
[09:49:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The Last Christmas" was ... well, it didn't go anywhere too interesting, except the usual "do not create unaligned intelligences, you morons"
[09:49:55] <feep[work]> also he wrote that hpmor epilogue where harry has a harem of everyone
[09:50:05] <quanticle> A Deeper Shade of Blue... that was the Frozen fanfic, right?
[09:50:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Bluer
[09:50:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> shade of white
[09:50:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> And yes

[10:09:00] <feep[work]> ngnl is degenerate trash that 1. is fully aware it is degenerate trash 2. dares you to do something about it
[10:09:10] <nshepperd2> Obormot\Arcturus: no, i think 1A & 2B is inconsistent even if you just assume that the utility of a bet is monotonically increasing in the utility of the outcomes
[10:09:21] <feep[work]> it has thorough and uncompromising dedication to the theme, and that gives it glory.
[10:09:30] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: there won't be a second season btw
[10:09:34] <feep[work]> I know.
[10:11:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: I don't think even that assumption is justified
[10:11:43] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: I mean hey, maybe it can be the first illegal anime
[10:11:45] <nshepperd2> really?
[10:11:59] <nshepperd2> i mean, monotonically increasing when the probabilities are constant
[10:12:33] <nshepperd2> seems pretty obvious to me that a chance of a better outcome is better than a chance of a worse outcome
[10:12:34] <PapuaHardyNet> wireheading via AI will be possible in the next 15 years
[10:13:00] <PapuaHardyNet> you'll be able to generate porn, anime, stories, all catered to your specific desires faster than you can consume them
[10:13:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: Oh, when the probabilities are constant, sure, then it's a fine assumption, but in this case the probabilities are all different so... that assumption gets you nowhere
[10:13:21] <feep[work]> man that'll be great
[10:13:45] <nshepperd2> Obormot\Arcturus: ah, but that's where the fact that 2A/B are just 34% chances of getting to play 1A/B comes in
[10:14:26] <saturn2> "Surely, the certainty of having $24,000 should count for something. You can feel the difference, right? The solid reassurance?" yes... the certainty means if the experimenter doesn't pay up, you can confidently accuse him of scamming you, otherwise you just look like a sore loser
[10:14:33] <nshepperd2> Obormot\Arcturus: like you could literally formulate 2A/B as "you roll a d100, and on ≤34, then you play 1A/B"
[10:16:33] <nshepperd2> monotonically increasing utility then requires that since the outcome of getting to play 1A is better than 1B (according to your utility), then a 34% chance of 1A is better than a 34% chance of 1B
[10:17:02] <saturn2> kind of suspicious that this supposed bias turns out to be exactly what you'd do if you didn't automatically trust random people offering bets
[10:17:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: You're still making assumptions about the ... hm, how to put this... expectations carrying through, so to speak
[10:17:39] <nshepperd2> nah
[10:20:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: i.e., Suppose I choose 1A > 1B, then choose 2B > 2A, and then, if the d100 rolled <= 34, wish that I could change my choice... that would be irrational, yes?
[10:20:37] <nshepperd2> saturn2 is right that this bet would never happen in real life though, because real life is adversarial
[10:21:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Becuase I'd have no preference for d100 roll > 34, and if on <= 34 I prefer A to B, then I should prefer 2A to 2B wholesale)
[10:21:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> BUT it's not actually structured that way, the bet as given is a single roll and I never get any guarantees
[10:21:51] <nshepperd2> don't see how that matters
[10:22:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> It matters for the reason saturn2 said
[10:22:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Certainty is an obvious advantage
[10:22:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Counterfactuals aren't real, but promises are
[10:23:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I totally would've paid you if that die had come up differently than it in fact just did" is worthless, but "I will definitely pay you" is potentially actionable
[10:24:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> So if bet #2 was in fact "I roll a d100 and if it's <= 34, I offer you bet #1" then I choose A (and expect to see a result > 34, with 99+% certainty)
[10:25:04] <nshepperd2> hm
[10:25:19] <nshepperd2> well that's true and it does explain peoples' actual behaviour
[10:26:54] <nshepperd2> because in real life the bet isn't the 4 things described on that page
[10:27:31] <nshepperd2> it's "someone claims the bet is 1A/1B/2A/2B"
[10:28:31] <nshepperd2> in that adversarial situation it is advantageous to choose the option claimed to be 1A for the usual reasons of spite
[10:29:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes... relatedly, we might note that Maurice Allais did not actually offer the stated bet to subjects and did not actually hand out ludicrous sums of money to subjects to prove a psychological point
[10:29:58] <saturn2> if your rationality training encourages people to think "X" instead of "someone claims X" you're actually harming them
[10:30:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indeed
[10:30:53] <nshepperd2> i would like to know if peoples' answers change if the thought experiment is described in a way that makes the situation unambiguously non-adversarial
[10:31:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, that's the thing: how would you actually construct this scenario? I mean, how would you construct a test of the Allais paradox, such that participants had good reason to believe that the probabilities are exactly what they're claimed to be?
[10:32:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> And note, that's both "how do you construct the thought experiment such that..." (that's the easy question, relatively speaking!) and also "how do you *actually* set it up to actually test it?" (which is way harder than even the former)
[10:32:55] <nshepperd2> dunno
[10:33:02] <nshepperd2> might be impossible
[10:33:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> It might indeed!
[10:33:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> But if so, what's even the point of any supposed "rules of decision-making" that tell you to do the "rational" thing in "this scenario"?
[10:34:49] <nshepperd2> i'm sure scenarios like these happen sometimes. often even

[10:45:03] <kuudes> you could add a roll to 1a
[10:45:28] <kuudes> then 1a and 1b would have equal amount of rolls and their adversiality would be similar

[12:49:25] <Filipepe> hi RiversHaveWings
[12:49:28] <RiversHaveWings> hi!
[12:50:12] <nshepperd2> silly me, installing the proprietary version of cuda, instead of... uhh
[12:51:04] <feep[work]> nuveauda
[12:51:11] <feep[work]> nudaveau?
[12:51:56] <feep[work]> well you could https://github.com/hughperkins/coriander

[12:52:16] <nshepperd2> i bet it doesn't work
[12:52:22] <feep[work]> almost definitely
[12:52:50] <feep[work]> I think the big thing is that ... there are people who care about open source, and there are people who care about deep learning, and those people have approximately no overlap
[12:53:06] * feep[work] thinks to rephrase
[12:53:12] <feep[work]> like, open source ecosystems*
[12:53:36] <feep[work]> but to be fair this is mostly because nvidia gives no fucks and nvidia is basically deep learning rn
[12:54:07] <feep[work]> which also to be fair is because amd made one good deep learning gpu and then stopped
[12:54:43] <feep[work]> I genuinely cannot tell whether amd don't *want* to compete in dl or if they're just really really bad at it
[12:55:39] <feep[work]> if google started selling tpus tomorrow they'd probably beat amd for dl accelerators in like half a year
[12:56:08] <feep[work]> I cannot even tell if amd's tpus are any good, I've never seen one or known anyone who has
[12:56:32] <feep[work]> they once sold a graphics card that was basically a relabelled tpu, and I happily bought it, and they have given this ~ zero follow-up
[12:56:38] <feep[work]> on the other hand, all *its* drivers are open source at least.
[12:56:58] <feep[work]> so you know, if you want an open source dl stack, there you go, have fun fishing for radeon viis on ebay
[12:57:17] <feep[work]> or wait for intel's next nth gpu attempt I guess
[12:58:30] <feep[work]> "intel gpus: this time for sure"
[12:58:54] <PapuaHardyNet> radeion vii is a relabelled tpu?
[12:58:57] <feep[work]> yeah
[12:59:36] <PapuaHardyNet> okay so you mean it doesn't do any graphics computation and is optimized for floating point computation with huge matrices?
[12:59:55] <feep[work]> no it has graphics
[13:00:05] <feep[work]> but it's tpu hardware with "be a gpu" support patched on
[13:00:26] <PapuaHardyNet> what does "tpu hardware" mean, according to you
[13:00:43] <feep[work]> well, at least that's what I always thought
[13:00:59] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: amd have a series of dl accelerators, instinct
[13:01:11] <feep[work]> ie. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radeon_Instinct

Compared to the Radeon brand of mainstream consumer/gamer products, the Radeon Instinct branded products are intended to accelerate deep learning, artificial neural network, and high-performance computing/GPGPU applications. …)
[13:01:51] <PapuaHardyNet> hey, I found a retailer selling radion vii at around 1000$
[13:01:55] <feep[work]> and to my understanding vii is basically a relabeled mi6 with some texture hardware bolted on
[13:02:10] <PapuaHardyNet> in my country , at 1000$ usd equivalent to local currency I mean
[13:02:14] <feep[work]> misomething anyway
[13:03:14] <feep[work]> mi50*
[13:03:26] <PapuaHardyNet> should I get it at that price feep
[13:03:28] <feep[work]> like, look at the comparison https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-radeon-vii-double-precision-disabled,38437.html

[13:03:53] <feep[work]> driver support is its own brand of special, and only ~ half of dl demos work
[13:04:19] <feep[work]> and amd give approximately no fucks about it anymore
[13:04:29] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, that doesn't sound good
[13:04:33] <feep[work]> like, if you *really really* want an open source dl stack, it's the only game in town

[16:10:51] <PlanckWalk> Yes, certainty is very much more valuable than even 97% likelihood.
[16:11:38] <RiversHaveWings> I have a thing which is supposed to produce samples out of 10 different categories w/ equal probability and I want to know whether it is and, if it isn't, how far off it is.
[16:12:18] <RiversHaveWings> I can compute KL divergence but there is going to be variance in this estimate and I don't know how to quantify how much.
[16:12:34] <RiversHaveWings> Since I have to actually draw like 1000 samples and if I don't draw as many my estimate isn't as good.
[16:12:56] <RiversHaveWings> So KL isn't the best measure.
[16:13:59] <RiversHaveWings> These are the actual proportions from a batch of 1000 samples: [0.1100, 0.0980, 0.1000, 0.0950, 0.1150, 0.1150, 0.0990, 0.0820, 0.0950, 0.0910]
[16:14:08] <RiversHaveWings> Looks pretty close to uniform but is it really?
[16:15:05] <RiversHaveWings> (For all intents and purposes my assignment of samples to categories is perfect.)
[16:15:31] <PlanckWalk> At first glance, it looks indistinguishable for that sample size since the stdev for any one bucket shoudl be around sqrt(0.9*0.1/1000) ~= 0.0100.
[16:15:54] <nshepperd> draw samples from the posterior Dirichlet distribution of the proportions and compute divergence for each of the samples
[16:16:03] <PlanckWalk> But yeah, you can do a Chi-squared statistic or something
[16:16:11] <nshepperd> then you can calculate mean and variance of the kl divergence
[16:16:52] <PlanckWalk> There's lots of ways to measure difference from a reference distribution, each corresponding to different relevant properties.
[16:19:55] <PlanckWalk> It also matters whether you want to investigate other properties such as independence, not just expected value of number of samples of each type.

[16:32:45] <RiversHaveWings> they're from a diffusion model

[16:33:26] <RiversHaveWings> I trained the model on the same ten real samples over and over.
[16:33:38] <RiversHaveWings> As a simple mode coverage test.
[16:34:06] <RiversHaveWings> I just find the nearest real data point to each generated sample and that's how I do the categorization.
[16:35:28] <RiversHaveWings> This sounds super easy but GANs can't do it ^^;;
[16:37:02] <RiversHaveWings> Except maybe WGAN-GP?
[16:37:15] <RiversHaveWings> But even that failed when training on a single real data point.
[16:37:25] <RiversHaveWings> Whereas diffusion works fine even in that limit.

In the direct path (the cognitive route) job characteristics function as inputs in conscious judgments related to work, in particular to job satisfaction. The existence of such a path between work features and 
[18:02:49] <two2thehead> job satisfaction is well established also in research on job design (e. g., see 13, 14, 15). The indirect path postulated in AET is linked to the direct experience of emotions at work and was vastly ignored before the formulation of AET. This path works via the affective route. Job characteristics (e.g., job autonomy) determine the occurrence of affective events at work (e.g., an argument with an unfriendly client). These events elicit emotions 
[18:02:50] <two2thehead> (e.g., anger), which is moderated and directly influenced by personality dispositions. In turn, these affective reactions influence both job attitudes and affective based work behaviour (see Figure 1)(16-18)."

[18:51:45] <two2thehead> "Purpose: Affective Events Theory (AET) highlights the importance of work events as antecedents of distinct emotions, attitudes, and work behavior. However, few attempts have been made to systematically classify positive and negative work events. The aim of this study was to develop a comprehensive taxonomy of affective work events to provide a common frame of reference for future research and to improve communication among researchers regarding 
[18:51:46] <two2thehead> research on affective work events. Design and Methodological Approach: Positive and negative affective work events were sampled from employees using a diary study design. We used concept mapping methodology as an exploratory approach to analyze the data on affective work events. Findings: Two hundred eighteen employees reported 559 positive and 383 negative affective work events. We identified four positive and seven negative event clusters. Each 
[18:51:47] <two2thehead> event cluster showed a unique relationship with distinct affective states, even when controlling for the occurrence of events without clustering and trait affect. The results support the validity of our taxonomy. Implications: This study contributes to previous literature by providing a comprehensive yet parsimonious classification of both positive and negative affective work events. The affective work event clusters found reflect personal values of 
[18:51:54] <two2thehead> agency and communion. This classification of affective events as reflecting agentic and communal values provides a starting point for the integration of findings from previous studies. Originality and Value: The taxonomy developed in this study provides an integrative approach and a basis for future research to more differentially investigate relationships proposed by AET."

[20:36:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Can someone explain the green lines to me
[20:37:14] <adiabatic> the person leaning in is more into the other person than the reverse
[20:37:15] <adiabatic> IIRC
[20:37:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> I see
[20:42:59] <saturn2> the person leaning in is taking the female role in the relationship
[20:43:14] <saturn2> if it's the man, it's bad news
[20:43:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I edited Wikipedia precisely once. There was an article about a war hero, which at the end included a section about appearances in popular media or fiction. I realized this person had been the subject of a Sabaton song unmentioned in the article, so I edited the page to include a line about it in the list of media/fictional appearances. It took about 30 minutes for some asshole to revert the edit as "not relevant" or
[20:43:46] <Obormot\Arcturus>  something. You're just sitting there waiting for somebody to edit _your_ page so you can crap on their contrubtion? Screw you buddy."
[20:45:55] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: it's some sort of PUA-derived meme about them trying to make objective estimates of alphaness by using pose-estimation machine learning models. the green lines are the default model depiction of the posed skeleton it estimates
[20:46:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> I... see
[20:48:35] <gwern> so to make fun of their pseudoscience, people use it in a virgin vs chad sort of way
[20:48:55] <gwern> you depict the bad guy with a leaning green line and the good guy with a straight perpendicular green line
[20:49:45] <gwern> (I don't expect this particular meme to last)

[20:56:44] <kuudes> two2thehead, yes, but there is also a world of difference between "vaccinated don't emit at all" and "vaccinated emit less than unvaccinated"
[21:01:08] <two2thehead> kuudes, true but that's not what the antivaxx complainers are claiming
[21:02:12] <two2thehead> ie these are the same people that argue in bad faith that unvaxxed and vaxxed spread a) the same and b) spread an equal severity of covid
[21:04:09] <kuudes> I don't care about the antivaxxers
[21:04:29] <kuudes> I care about people who say "now we have got everyone vaxxed, we should stop taking precautions because that is bad for business"
[21:04:44] <kuudes> "third vaccines are not needed"
[21:05:40] <two2thehead> kuudes, I am reminded of the Leon Trotsky quote. "You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you". You may not be interested in antivaxxers, but antivaxxers are interested in you. :p
[21:05:40] <kuudes> "it is a basic right to have concert festivals"
[21:05:57] <kuudes> we have more of the openers than antivaxxers
[21:06:32] <kuudes> ie tourism industry and vantaa city are now moaning that we still continue border health controls for unvaccinated people
[21:06:49] <kuudes> and claim we should cease because "we are opening up the society"
[21:06:56] <two2thehead> Fine, let's go with a binary choice then. What would you rather have, no antivaxxers && lots of openers vs lots of antivaxxers && no openers?
[21:07:05] <two2thehead> I'm trying to figure out your perspective here
[21:07:20] <kuudes> neither?
[21:07:25] <two2thehead> well yes
[21:07:45] <two2thehead> But I'm asking because the antivaxxers have a more negative impact on my utility vs openers
[21:07:59] <kuudes> here that "vaccinated do not spread covid" is used to make near-work mandatory again and removing mask requirements and removing closures
[21:08:19] <kuudes> we have mayb <2% of people antivaxxers here, I don't care
[21:08:34] <two2thehead> alright
[21:09:01] <kuudes> but I really would like to see some country actually opened up without a higher daily death rate to covid than finland
[21:09:02] * two2thehead updates even further towards High Trust societies have different median levels of policy preference

[21:10:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Loaves just slide out of it with no effort at all
[21:10:24] <kuudes> if we open up, is that the victory condition?
[21:10:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Much more easily than the aluminized-steel nonstick
[21:10:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And no flaking of the coating, of course)
[21:10:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> It does produce a much smoother crust (which I am not sure I like)
[21:10:59] <kuudes> israel at least seems sane with their plans to move to quarteryearly vaccinations
[21:11:40] <kuudes> but over here on the other side we have complaints that third vaccinations are excessive and we should donate our doses to poor countries
[21:11:58] <kuudes> and we have already donated half of our doses, all of johnson and az since spring
[21:12:16] <kuudes> but the health minister opposes donating pfizer and moderna doses
[21:12:45] <kuudes> as my friend says, it seems to me that many people seem to feel we are playing on too easy level I suppose :-p
[21:12:57] <mjr> Well yeah we donate the stuff we don't really want to use :P
[21:13:09] <kuudes> yes, and that is sanish
[21:13:27] <mjr> All good though as long as they go to use.
[21:13:32] <kuudes> indeed
[21:14:33] <kuudes> but I am pissed on that everyone wants to be as dynamic all the time
[21:14:40] <kuudes> couldn't we try to calm things down
[21:14:48] <mjr> quarterly vaccinations seems a bit overkill though
[21:15:03] <kuudes> show me the first country where covid does not spread anymore?
[21:15:27] <kuudes> after some country solves covid, lets do as they did
[21:15:42] <kuudes> but it seems to me uk and israel have not evidently solved it
[21:15:45] <kuudes> nor usa
[21:15:57] <kuudes> has denmark or norway?
[21:16:19] <kuudes> or portugal, with its more than 100% first dose coverage of some cohorts? :-p

[21:19:10] <mjr> last I found was they're waiting five months after second shot for booster
[21:19:21] <mjr> and that's the one
[21:20:00] <mjr> anyway yes that seems to be largely true. I think you're blowing the severity of the situation with widespread two dose regimen out of proportion.

[21:22:05] <mjr> Yeah that article only mentiones "it seems every few months — it could be once a year or five or six months — we’ll need another shot"
[21:22:27] <mjr> It doesn't even speculate with dosing people every three months.
[21:22:37] <kuudes> sure
[21:23:01] <kuudes> but 13 weeks seems quite easy schedule
[21:23:20] <mjr> Which was your original mention of their "plans to move to quarteryearly vaccinations"
[21:23:51] <kuudes> third dose at this point is 3 doses in 3/4 quarters of year
[21:24:09] <kuudes> and if they are preparing 4th now, that fits rather well to 4 doses per year
[21:24:21] <mjr> you're being disingenuous
[21:24:26] <kuudes> oh?

[21:27:12] <kuudes> mitä meinaat, en ymmärrä?
[21:27:32] <mjr> you're speculating about their fourth dose schedule which the article pretty much says is open, and you're conflating the initial regimen given weeks apart into something you're calling "quarteryearly" on speculated averages based on the initial regimen.
[21:28:38] <mjr> it's just, well, it sounds like they're gonna start giving vaccines every three months routinely, and that's just not the case
[21:29:36] <kuudes> their data shows that pfizer loses about half of its effectiveness in 100 days
[21:30:26] <kuudes> from about 0.2 factor to about 0.45 factor
[21:31:02] <mjr> that has really no relevance to you misrepresenting their plans
[21:32:55] <kuudes> hmm. I think I agree with you they have not said out loud they will have 4 doses in 2022, 2023 and 2024, is that what you are having a problem with?
[21:32:58] <mjr> Also can't really extrapolate from that data further.
[21:33:17] <kuudes> why?
[21:33:23] <mjr> (Vaccine schedules are _often_ front-heavy.)
[21:33:37] <kuudes> yes, but this disease can be expected to get worse
[21:34:06] <kuudes> which seems to me the likeliest thing nohynek bets with if she plans to get natural immunity into finnish population
[21:34:14] <mjr> They haven't said out loud even having four doses year one, you've just jumped the gun into assuming that.
[21:34:18] <kuudes> ie "better to get infected now than later"
[21:36:33] <kuudes> yes, I agree, they have not published a timetable "fourth dose will be delivered between X and Y dates"?
[21:36:38] <mjr> I'm not sure what they're planning, but yeah it seems likely that the vaccine immunity will end up being naturally boosted.
[21:36:56] <kuudes> yes, and I don't want to get infected
[21:37:18] <kuudes> it indeed would be nice if they would start to lay down vaccination schedules up to 2024
[21:37:31] <mjr> it would be silly
[21:37:57] <mjr> there's just not enough information to do anything of the sort in a meaningful way
[21:38:06] <kuudes> sure
[21:38:09] <kuudes> then we should wait
[21:38:38] <kuudes> I understand we can't uphold restrictions for longer than absolutely necessary
[21:39:28] <kuudes> but it feels a bit stressfull to have to put one's child to school and daycare as enforced by the duty of education law
[21:40:33] <kuudes> I am glad my older child likely has got vaccinated
[21:40:48] <kuudes> and am glad I'll get my third dose next week
[21:42:10] <mjr> Guess I can understand that; our kid was just boosted on Monday
[21:42:27] <kuudes> oh? congrats and condolences :-/
[21:42:48] <mjr> The first day possible.
[21:42:54] <kuudes> indeed
[21:43:51] <kuudes> personally I hold it about 50:50 I will get fourth dose on the week before christmas
[21:44:01] <kuudes> then it would be dose-12 weeks-dose regime
[21:45:36] <kuudes> but after vaccination becomes "complete", surely they should open the vaccine to normal prescription process, as the reason why it is limited is because of the pandemic supply control measures
[21:45:51] <rmmh> delta boosters when
[21:46:13] <kuudes> iirc by end of year from pfizer and moderna, but I'm unsure
[21:46:30] <kuudes> mu seems to be the next thing, it bypasses vaccination to some extent

[21:46:57] <kuudes> but basicly I don't see any reason against quarterly vaccination unless there are very serious harms from the vaccines
[21:47:10] <ggreer> covid just isn't a big deal for younger folks. an unvaccinated 18 year old has less to worry about than a fully vaccinated 30 year old
[21:47:35] <kuudes> yes, because a 18 year old has sexual selection mortality which much exceeds their biological mortality
[21:47:46] <ggreer> https://www.yahoo.com/now/more-kids-shot-chicago-died-205156094.html I mean I wasn't going to chicago any time soon but... yeah there are other priorities
[21:47:47] <Robomot> More kids shot in Chicago than have died of COVID-19 across US this year (More minors have been shot in Chicago than have died of COVID-19 over the course of 2021 so far, according to data from police and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).)
[21:48:01] <kuudes> for 7 years olds it again becomes more of a concern, but so do adverse effects of vaccines as well
[21:48:03] <ggreer> though that article plays fast and loose with the term "kids"
[21:48:06] <kuudes> yes
[21:48:38] <kuudes> over here kids do not get shot
[21:48:46] <kuudes> but so don't other people either generally
[21:48:50] <ggreer> that's true here too, but chiraq is a different story

[21:49:40] <two2thehead> kuudes, at what point does a vaccination-at-home service become plausible?
[21:49:51] <ggreer> rmmh: usually innocent bystanders or relatives of the intended targets
[21:50:28] <two2thehead> ie you download an app and an RN comes and injects you
[21:51:19] <kuudes> two2thehead, huh?
[21:52:00] <gwern> two2thehead: that sounds like a grotesque waste of valuable skilled labor
[21:52:04] <kuudes> I mean, for astrazeneca etc there is no reason why you couldn't just get it from a pharmacy, take it home and inject it there by yourself or by someone certified
[21:52:18] <two2thehead> like uber for vaccines. Instead of you going to a public infrastructure place, the vaccine comes to you
[21:52:29] <two2thehead> gwern, still worth considering before dismissing imo
[21:52:46] <gwern> uber only works because the drivers are otherwise pretty much useless, in great supply, and the system can be hyperoptimized to death
[21:53:15] <kuudes> two2thehead, if convenience was that much saught after, an injection pen would be better
[21:53:18] <gwern> anytime you have home appointments, utilization falls through the floor. travel time, gaps, distance, people not being home...
[21:53:43] <kuudes> those work without expertise. you press it against the injection spot, it autofires and injects you
[21:53:55] <gwern> no, the nurse can sit there in a CVS in the middle of town and wait for a queue to form and everyone drop by while doing their chores
[21:54:00] <kuudes> .wp injection pen
[21:54:03] <feepbot> kuudes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injector_pen An injector pen (also called a medication pen) is a device used for injecting medication under the skin. First introduced in the 1980s, injector pens are designed to make injectable medication easier and more convenient to use, thus increasing patient adherence.
[21:54:31] <kuudes> those are used for frequent injection meds such as insulin etc
[21:54:42] <two2thehead> kuudes, gwern, hmm
[21:54:45] <two2thehead> all good points
[21:54:49] <rmmh> Obormot\Arcturus: I wish we could allow language that's 99% correct
[21:55:07] <two2thehead> alright, good enough responses for me. kuudes gwern +1
[21:55:20] <kuudes> there just has not been that much of mrna vaccine production that we would have had time to make such out of it
[21:55:28] <kuudes> and mrna vaccines require superfreezing
[21:55:46] <kuudes> I don't see any reason why astrazeneca etc would not be put into such
[21:55:59] <kuudes> they stay at fridge temps, so it is pretty normal
[21:56:45] <kuudes> I already get my injectors every three weeks from pharmacy, these days on the pharmacy yard where there are no others, like a drug deal... :-p
[21:57:03] <two2thehead> :V
[21:57:35] <kuudes> they just bill me with e-bill, this has been really nice
[21:57:52] <mjr> the vaccines want to go into a muscle though and not just subdermal
[21:57:58] <kuudes> I presume we will keep like this after the pandemic with pharmacy and groceries
[21:58:13] <kuudes> mjr, hmm, indeed
[21:58:21] <kuudes> do we have injector pens for that?
[21:58:24] <ggreer> I'd be a little more wary of the adenovirus-based vaccines. they put DNA into your cells and your cells don't stop producing the modified spike protein until they're killed off by your immune system. most of the cells are muscle cells so it's not a big deal, but the vaccine does travel through your lymphatic system into other tissues. IIRC some gets in your brain, so you're gonna get some neurons killed off
[21:58:25] <ggreer> the question is if it's enough to matter long term
[21:58:35] <kuudes> iirc injector pen to your arm usually has to be used by another person
[21:58:54] <rmmh> ggreer: they also get less effective with each additional shot
[21:59:02] <kuudes> yes
[21:59:04] <rmmh> because your immune system kills the adenovirus before it infects
[21:59:04] <ggreer> with the mRNA vaccines, your cells stop producing the spike protein after <24 hours. it's not clear if your immune system has time to spin up and kill off the cells in that time
[21:59:18] <ggreer> yeah also that. that's why sputnik V uses a different adenovirus for the second shot
[21:59:24] <rmmh> with mrna vaccines do your cells rupture from excess spike protein?
[21:59:49] <kuudes> but do we have much reasons to presume *new* adverse effects on later doses?

[22:00:16] <kuudes> I mean, I presume pfizer and moderna will give 1/50000 receivers heart muscle inflammation
[22:00:26] <ggreer> maybe the ones that got a shitload of mRNA could burst, but that would be muscle cells in your arm. by the time it got to your other tissues, the dose would be very diluted
[22:00:28] <mjr> I mean I know it injects viral DNA, I was just not aware the cells wouldn't toss it out at some point
[22:01:09] <kuudes> I don't really have it salient what should be expected to be the showstopper adverse effect from repeated vaccinations
[22:01:13] <mjr> or, I mean, wear it out in the transcription or whatnot
[22:01:21] <kuudes> shitty feelings and day off from work does not count for me
[22:01:33] <kuudes> it would have to be something comparable to long covid as threat
[22:01:47] <kuudes> ie semipermanent disability because of the Nth dose?
[22:01:51] <kuudes> or death, I suppose
[22:01:59] <kuudes> but those do not seem likely
[22:02:02] <rmmh> ggreer: adenoviruses don't intecrate into the nucleus, though
[22:02:21] <kuudes> as I expect autoimmune threats come mostly visible already in the first dosing of the world
[22:02:23] <rmmh> I think? they don't have reverse transcriptase / integrase
[22:02:48] <mjr> rmmh, they do not, this much I've actually read
[22:03:29] <ggreer> reverse transcriptase is RNA->DNA. that's how HIV gets in your genome

[22:04:21] <ggreer> but if you just have some DNA chillin' in a cell, I think normal transcriptase will keep making RNA from it, and ribosomes will make proteins from the RNA
[22:04:26] <mjr> Apropos immunity against the adenovector, Sputnik has different adenoviruses for the shots. Too bad they neglected to disable the second shot's replication... And other questions about the supply chain abound.
[22:04:46] <kuudes> yes
[22:05:12] <kuudes> and also countries said they received different phase of matter for the vaccines as specified, and different forms compared to each other
[22:05:30] <kuudes> but self-replicating infectious covid vaccine would be quite cyberpunk solution
[22:05:41] <mjr> ANYWAY I'm quite happy with having gotten the newfangled mRNA.
[22:05:49] <kuudes> I agree
[22:06:03] <ggreer> if adenovirus vaccines were the only ones available, I'd totally have gotten one
[22:06:19] <kuudes> but do we have something actually known threat from 3+ doses rather than just precautionary principle?
[22:06:28] <mjr> ("Oh my god but we don't know what the newfangled mRNA does to your body long term" shut the fuck up you idiot what did you think a sars-cov-2 infection was going to do in your cells?)
[22:06:36] <ggreer> I'm just glad there's a safer option
[22:06:52] <rmmh> ggreer: hm good point, I guess even if it's not in the genome just hanging out in the nucleus is enough

[22:09:48] <ggreer> it is using up some of your immune system's "fluid" capability and replacing it with "crystallized" capability. one reason our immune systems suck in old age is that we have too many memory b cells and not enough regular b cells
[22:09:56] <kuudes> I prefer not to use basic otc painkillers for vaccines unless it gets really bad

[22:42:47] <rmmh> The Florentine Codex outlines much of the advice the tlamatlquiticitl [Aztec midwives] gave to expecting mothers. The mother was advised to engage in sex with her husband during the first few months of the pregnancy so as to help the child develop, but around the seventh or eighth month she was to abstain. If she did not it was believed that the semen may act like glue and the baby would not
[22:42:49] <rmmh> come out, or if it did it would be feeble with misshaped fingers and toes and covered in what looks like atole so that everyone would see how the couple could not abstain, and they would be shamed.
