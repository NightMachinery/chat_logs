[00:02:05] <debnet> Abeit custom one, maybe Django have a list of built-in types somewhere?

[07:18:23] <bandit_za> is it possible to 1) serve a page from django before migrations have been run and 2) run migrations and create a super user as a result of a web request? I would like to run a django app that is meant to be run locally by a nontechnical enduser
[07:19:02] <bandit_za> if anyone has any tips or can point me to some literature, that would be useful

[07:23:48] <GinFuyou> bandit_za, I'd think it would be problematic

[07:25:19] *** Joins: vdamewood (~vdamewood@fedora/vdamewood)
[07:25:39] <GinFuyou> On other hand if project is for local (non mass public) use, you could bundle a ready sqlite database with it
[07:25:46] <bandit_za> GinFuyou:
[07:25:55] <bandit_za> please if you have nothing constructive to say rather not reply
[07:26:09] <bandit_za> I have observed you here for a while and I find 99% of your comments unhelpful
[07:26:27] <bandit_za> you are talking about things I didn't ask about
[07:27:27] <GinFuyou> Please, if you don't have a constructive question to ask, don't do it
[07:28:23] <bandit_za> I'm not going to get into an argument here, I believe you have good intentions, but sometimes it is better not to just talk for the sake of talking
[07:30:48] <GinFuyou> I'm talking for a god damn sake of understanding of problem and context of it to see if I know a fitting solution of it or not (even if I don't someone else may)
[07:31:20] <bandit_za> questions were specific. there were two of them and context was provided
[07:31:56] <bandit_za> if you must know I will bundle django into an installer and use a local sqlite
[07:32:11] <bandit_za> double clicking my icon will launch a waitress webserver
[07:33:11] <GinFuyou> Ok, so you can bundle a sqlite database with so you 1. don't have to run migrations at all. 2. can include an existing superuser with it
[07:46:21] <GinFuyou> Normally you can't show a page without migrations without taking out core things I believe. But since there is a starting page built-in you might be able to hook with it. Or make some fail-over middleware, that catches migration-related errors and returns a default page
[07:46:45] <GinFuyou> So, if possible I'd try to avoid it. e.g. as I said with a bundled database
[07:47:31] <GinFuyou> Or make a hook to create database before whole server is started with the app
[07:48:36] <GinFuyou> 2 part is pretty trivial, you can use calling management command from the view. Problem is the starting page

[10:56:36] <GinFuyou> hzm74_, anyway printing what is object_list and object_ids may help
[10:57:10] <hzm74_> GinFuyou, thnx, gonna try it out.
[10:57:49] <GinFuyou> Also your table is only for deleting? Would be better to use forms here (it's always a good choice)
[10:58:52] <GinFuyou> for delete it's not strictly required, overall your code looks like it should work

[11:01:22] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[11:02:06] <GinFuyou> sounds like a formset, depends on how you want it to work
[11:02:07] <hzm74_> How can i print the object_list? I know how to use the django-shell. But the object-list is filled with selected rows in the webbrowser. So how do i simulate that in a shell?
[11:03:08] *** Joins: dre (~dre@2001:8003:c932:c301:8916:3a5f:8275:217d)
[11:03:08] <GinFuyou> well, you could just print(object_list) it will show in runserver's log
[11:03:33] <GinFuyou> since you say nothing seem to be deleted, I expect it to be empty
[11:05:03] *** Joins: luigibu1 (~luigibu@80.30.201.209)
[11:05:38] <GinFuyou> so ids would be also interesting to figure out why filter makes it empty. Might be because ids are textual when filter matches integers
[11:11:58] <hzm74_> Is this the way to print / log the object_list: https://dpaste.org/D4VH
[11:12:56] *** Quits: luigibu1 (~luigibu@80.30.201.209) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[11:13:06] <GinFuyou> no. either use logger or print
[11:13:14] <GinFuyou> not both
[11:14:02] <GinFuyou> logger is generally better, but for quick debugging print() is fine
[11:21:45] <hzm74_> hmm? My django runserver-shell is only printing this when i push the delete-button. No object-list is printed anywhere? https://dpaste.org/q2p6
[11:23:58] <GinFuyou> well, maybe your logging is not set correctly? That's why I suggested print() since it should just go into console output. Or you've used it?
[11:24:13] <GinFuyou> wait

[11:29:38] <hzm74_> That did the job. Pff don´t know where that came from. Sorry for abusing youre time.

[11:31:16] <GinFuyou> No problem, I should have looked more carefully on html from the beginning. Though it's always good to print out something, I've number of times hit a case when I just wasn't running the code I expected to work
[11:31:46] <hzm74_> Still don´t know how to get in console and printing the object_list. I have this in my view, but i don´t get into a shell?

[12:46:53] <GinFuyou> django.conf.settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL
[12:47:09] <GinFuyou> (import settings)
[12:51:21] <cm315> yes, i have done this and in my table "historic" which is where i want to reference the id of auth_user i put :   user = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING), it is ok?
[12:52:05] <cm315> GinFuyou, because when i see the relationship entity model it doesn't show any relationship between the auth_user table and my historic table
[12:54:35] <GinFuyou> yes, it's correct, what you mean by "relationship entity model"?
[13:00:00] <cm315> GinFuyou, i mean this https://pasteboard.co/eQT7oY0D2ENh.png, i don't see any relation with my historic table with the auth_user table
[13:00:55] <GinFuyou> it's user_id
