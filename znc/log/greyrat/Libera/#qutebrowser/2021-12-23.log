[14:18:45] <The-Compiler> jtgd: that's weird, I don't see why that shouldn't work in passthrough mode. Are you sure that's a Facebook thing and not coming from some extension you have installed or something?

[16:14:54] <arza> no

[16:28:03] <VuiMuich> :thanks unfortunatelly you are right, the sessions in that place are not the lost one. I guess I need to restore the tabs manually by the history, thankfully I had a reboot this morning, so it should be relatively easy to judge by the time. And I guess I should make it a habbit, to regulary safe to some different session then just the default...
