[02:53:50] <parsnip> you are interpreting one wrong consequence, which is convenient

[05:55:12] <bilb_ono> background is too light. I could do with a light grey
[05:55:46] <bilb_ono> maybe it is the best one though
[06:01:03] <parsnip> yeah i'm not a fan of the bright orange used in so many popular themes
[06:01:51] <bpalmer> do you want text to be driven over by careless people who aren't even paying attention to their keyboard? Bright orange attracts attention!
[06:04:50] <parsnip> bright orange prevents being driven over?
[06:05:21] <parsnip> why don't police wear bright orange?
[06:05:46] <bpalmer> haven't you seen crossing guards?
[06:05:56] <parsnip> i'm not a crossing guard
[06:06:06] <grym> ours wear 'hi-viz' yellow

[06:51:51] <LordRishav> I am trying to use authinfo for authentication in Emacs, but Emacs can't decrypt the gpg encrypted file. GPG is giving some extraneous information like "gpg: Signature made Thursday 31..." and "gpg: Good signature from..." when it tries to decrypt it so it can't just read it. I searched it up online and they said one can do it in a shell by redirecting stderr to /dev/null. It does work, in a shell, but Emacs doesn't seem to do it.

[12:17:52] <bpalmer> e.g., it can call a function if delete-other-windows window parameter is a function, or the bit at the end where it may raise errors instead or "Do not delete any window whose ‘no-delete-other-windows’ parameter is non-nil."

[15:45:59] <Demosthenex> so, i had emacs crash (x11 bug) the otehr day, and i lost the history in my sly repl. any way to make it save history more frequently?
[15:47:25] <bpalmer> Guest_135: one way to iterate over a list that I'd suggest in your case is:  (let ((list '(X Y Z)) head) (while list (setq head (car list) list (cdr list)) ...))  and inside that while loop, head is whatever had been the first element of the list
[15:47:35] <bpalmer> Guest_135: thus, in turn, X, Y, and then Z
[15:47:42] <thuna`> Guest_135: does it have to be characters? Would strings work?
[15:48:08] <thuna`> I was thinking of regexp matching
[15:48:42] <bpalmer> Guest_135: notice, also, that I used let to establish local variables; setq *modifies* the binding previously established by let, punching all the way up to a global variable if there is no previous let in scope.
[15:50:12] <bpalmer> I'd agree with thuna`; your problem is easier if you're translating from string to string ("a" to "z" , "b" to "y" , and so on), as you'll have less need for type conversions.

[15:56:58] <Demosthenex> bpalmer: yeah, i noticed that, it's got to restart the search
[15:57:03] <bpalmer> Demosthenex: (setq l (cdr l)) shortens the list l by one, right? (assuming a proper list)
[15:57:05] <Demosthenex> good catch
[15:57:22] <thuna`> You could also just (interactive "r") it
[15:57:23] <Demosthenex> why not just map over the list? doesn't change the original
[15:57:29] <bpalmer> so (while l (setq l (cdr l)) ...)  runs as many times as there are items in the list.
[15:58:14] <bpalmer> (because when l is empty, l is nil, so while stops).
[15:58:26] <thuna`> But this can replace already replaced characters
[15:58:41] <thuna`> (("a" . "b") ("b" . "c")) would fail
[15:58:54] <bpalmer> yeah, that gets into an ambiguity in the problem.

[20:49:07] <hodapp> well, Turing did also coin the term AI
[20:49:56] <TRS-80> So I read 'The Roots of Lisp' recently, where Graham says: "If you understand McCarthy's ~eval~, you understand more than just a stage in the history of languages.  These ideas are still the semantic core of Lisp today.  So studying McCarthy's original paper shows us, in a sense, what Lisp really is.  It's not something that McCarthy designed so much as something he discovered.  It's not
[20:49:59] <TRS-80> intrinsically a language for AI or for rapid prototyping, or any other task at that level.  /It's what you get (or one thing you get) when you try to axiomatize computation/. (emphasis mine)"

[21:03:52] <TRS-80> corwin: I think maybe?
[21:05:04] <TRS-80> Graham also asserts "Over time, the median language, meaning the language used by the median programmer, has grown consistently closer to Lisp.  So by understanding ~eval~ you're understanding what will probably be the main model of computation well into the future."  Which I had a nice chuckle about.  :)

[23:24:07] <TikityTik> how can I use package-install helm? on `emacs -Q`?
[23:24:17] <TikityTik> it's saying there's no match for helm, i want to leave a bug report
[23:24:24] <TikityTik> also emacs-helm.sh doesn't work for me

[23:27:51] <parsnip> TikityTik: maybe try putting a minimal .emacs in /tmp/testing then `HOME=/tmp/testing emacs`
[23:28:32] <parsnip> TikityTik: for example, http://ix.io/3TX7/elisp
[23:30:48] <parsnip> i have a vague recollection that -Q messes with package.el working
[23:31:01] <parsnip> i forget the mechanism of breakage
[23:32:18] <TikityTik> yeah i was following these instructions about emacs -Q https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/wiki/Bugs
[23:32:52] *** Parts: nosolls (~user@user/nosolls) (ERC (IRC client for Emacs 27.2))
[23:34:46] <parsnip> maybe they meant -Q plus installing helm from source. but my recipe seems nice enough.

[23:35:03] <TikityTik> thank you
[23:35:25] <parsnip> > Note: always restart Emacs after reinstalling Helm (or other packages) for updates to take effect.
[23:35:29] <TikityTik> Doesn't seem like they have `helm-project-smart-do-search` as a function
[23:36:53] <parsnip> i guess not
[23:37:14] <parsnip> is that a spacemacs function?

[23:46:00] <TikityTik> i am using it in spacemacs and filed a bug report already but i was told to file the bug upstream https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/15437
[23:46:58] <aidalgol> An emacs package that requires you to restart after installation?  HERESY!
[23:48:09] <parsnip> TikityTik: i noticed your stack trace seems to leave spacemacs at helm-do-ag. can you reproduce the issue without spacemacs?
[23:48:18] <parsnip> i don't use helm
[23:48:43] <parsnip> hmm, that is in emacsorphanage
[23:48:57] <parsnip> so probably on melpa
[23:52:06] <parsnip> i guess you'll want to determine first if you can reproduce the issue with with helm-ag, without spacemacs
[23:52:26] <parsnip> then you'll want to see if you can reproduce issue with just helm, without helm-ag
[23:52:38] <parsnip> s/with with/with/
[23:54:17] <parsnip> i recommend you provide videos with asciinema in the future, and make sure your emacs frame is not too big, so people can see what's going on
