[09:38:48] <p-i-> I'm experiencing different behaviour between Python's `regex` module (not `re` which is in stdlib) and https://regex101.com/r/EDKA1p/1
[09:39:58] <purplex> its not python, its pcre2
[09:40:41] <p-i-> https://bpa.st/WKFQ
[09:40:44] <p-i-> This is the Python code
[09:41:17] <p-i-> In Python, 'symbol' is capturing the first line, so I'm getting '#Foo\n1000SHIB/USDT'
[09:41:36] <p-i-> In regex101 I'm correctly getting 1000SHIB/USDT
[09:41:59] <p-i-> Yes, Python's `regex` lib doesn't make any claim to be PCRE2 compliant
[09:42:03] <p-i-> It's a nuisance
[09:43:47] <p-i-> ah my bad. I was using .DOTALL flag in Python
[09:44:16] <p-i-> I needed [^\n]*? instead of .*?

[09:46:37] <purplex> sometimes mind works best under pressure
[09:48:02] <p-i-> I've had examples of incompatibilities before, so when something goes wrong I have to catch myself from jumping to the "easy solution" that my regex engine is b0rked.
[09:49:21] <purplex> don't we almost always move from easy solution to refined solution?
[09:50:12] <purplex> after getting slapped :p
[09:50:54] <p-i-> I lose so much time debugging because I have made some prior assumption.
[09:53:29] <purplex> yes that can be a problem i have also faced when you strongly believe how things _should_ work vs. how things actually work
[09:53:52] <p-i-> I wish regex had separate syntaxes for a . that goes up to the \n and a . that includes \n
[09:54:28] <p-i-> Maybe it's cleanest if I avoid the . syntax entirely
[09:55:04] <p-i-> and just use [\s\S]*? and [^\n]*? to clearly separate them out.
[09:55:17] <p-i-> Sometimes I want both functionalities within the same regex
[09:56:20] <purplex> i'd also avoid . as much possible
[09:56:54] <purplex> its blindly capturing, less purpose in it
[09:58:13] <purplex> i only use it for backtracking (mostly)

[13:51:15] <purplex> we can say it like this /\bhello (?!world\b)/ it won't match 'hello' if it is followed by world
[13:52:08] <purplex> but in your language it is marked as (NOT SUPPORTED)
[13:54:39] <digitok> i.e. "no" :>

[14:05:19] <purplex> i recall digitok did some trick with OR operators to replace it, but in this case i think it won't work
[14:06:09] <no_gravity> Hmm.. some funky trick might work.
[14:06:27] <purplex> there's a whole lot of useful things marked as not supported
[14:06:51] <no_gravity> Like this: hello ([^w]|w[^o]|wo[^r]...)
[14:07:55] <purplex> yes something like that, but it doesn't do what an 'assertion' like negative lookahead does
[14:08:15] <no_gravity> Why not?
[14:09:13] <purplex> it will return a match of at least one character, but an assertion doesn't consume
[14:10:30] <no_gravity> Ah yes. But consumption if fine with me.
[14:10:49] <purplex> maybe you can do hello (world) and check if group 1 exists?
[14:10:51] <no_gravity> I want to match "hello moon", "hello saturn" etc but not "hello world".
[14:11:10] <purplex> if it exists, then ignore 'hello'
[14:11:45] <no_gravity> In the interface, I can just enter a regex. I would not know how to test for a group.
[14:11:47] <purplex> but your actual problem could be complex, that's just simple example
[14:13:13] <purplex> there's a conditional branch thing which can check if group exists but your language doesn't support that either
[14:13:23] <no_gravity> Yeah
[14:13:39] <no_gravity> It is not that much of a problem.
[14:14:01] <no_gravity> I will just construct something with "hello ([^w]|w[^o]..)
[14:14:48] <purplex> do you want to simply just test 'hello world' like string? if so then probably you can use that
[14:15:39] <no_gravity> It is to find urls. I want all urls that match some/... but not some/thing.

[23:46:54] <re101-walrus-89> https://regex101.com/r/zT7NXD/1 hello - I'm trying to replace all "-" characters with a space " " within two strings. I'm able to match all the characters, but not "-". PCRE.
[23:48:18] <re101-walrus-89> attempt to match "-" characters matches nothing: (<LINK_TEXT text=\\")([-]*)(\\">)
[23:49:47] <mysticspiral[m]> why dont you use a second regex fed with the result of the first?

[23:52:30] <re101-walrus-89> Thanks, mysticspiral... I don't know how to do that... I'm a novice with regex
[23:53:33] <mysticspiral[m]> its not a regex feature
[23:54:05] <mysticspiral[m]> do you using a programming language to apply the regex?
[23:55:15] <re101-walrus-89> No, it's just a flat text file with 300+ cells from a MySQL table. I'm applying regex in a text editor, BBEdit.
[23:56:42] <re101-walrus-89> ... then I'll push the cells back into MySQL after the regex work.
[23:56:45] <mysticspiral[m]> working on something https://regex101.com/r/zT7NXD/2
[23:57:49] <re101-walrus-89> Oh wow, that's great.
[23:58:44] <re101-walrus-89> Thank you so much, mysticspiral
[23:59:42] <mysticspiral[m]> im not sure if its good like that
