[00:01:58] <lantech19446> I know I don't have the experience for this listing but fuck I wish I did, this would change my life in immeasurable ways https://www.ziprecruiter.com/jobs/jobot-9cb907eb/azure-devops-engineer-f519c28f?lvk=vWu2gvxU6OSKmwyNB0khKw.--MFzLzTXyJ
[00:03:12] <rawtaz> bah it just puts me on their search page, not a specific job
[00:05:31] <lantech19446> odd
[00:06:09] <lantech19446> https://www.ziprecruiter.com/job/f519c28f
[00:06:14] <lantech19446> ok that should be the right link
[00:07:06] <rawtaz> "We're sorry, this job does not exist"
[00:07:16] <rawtaz> might be a location issue, im in sweden
[00:07:27] <lantech19446> wtf i literally just copied the link from the share this job function lol
[00:07:47] <lantech19446> it's an azure devops engineer position paying 160000-200000 a year
[00:08:29] <lantech19446> they aren't asking for crazy experience for that pay either they're much more reasonable than some of the sys admin listings i've seen in the wild
[00:20:27] <lantech19446> ok rawtaz I think I'm gonna go read a little and take a nap, thanks for the conversation as always you're a wealth of knowledge.
[00:21:18] <rawtaz> thats nice :)
[00:21:33] <rawtaz> oh dont take my word for being the truth etc, im just speculating :D
[00:21:39] <rawtaz> cheers cya
[00:21:51] <lantech19446> well you know more than I do and I appreciate any help I can get improving my life
[00:22:39] <rawtaz> thats fine :)
[00:23:38] <rawtaz> (truth is it's just a matter of having made more mistakes than you :P)
[02:21:53] <lantech19446> rawtaz: unless the book I'm reading is complete bullshit, devops culture seems to be much more accepting of making those mistakes than the traditional network culture of the past has been
[02:22:19] <rawtaz> ok :>
[02:26:36] <lantech19446> lol i mean i don't know anything about anything when it actually comes to working in devops but that's the way the unicorn project makes it seem
[02:29:02] <rawtaz> unicorn project :O
[02:30:04] <lantech19446> have you heard of it? it's the sequel to the pheonix project from the perspective of devs
[02:30:29] <rawtaz> no. can you link me to it?
[02:33:17] <lantech19446> yea give me a sec
[02:34:36] <lantech19446> https://www.amazon.com/The-Unicorn-Project-Gene-Kim-audiobook/dp/B0812C82T9/ref=sr_1_1?crid=UY5IODKHSS8K&keywords=the+unicorn+project&qid=1637967813&sprefix=the+unicorn%2Caps%2C184&sr=8-1
[02:37:18] <rawtaz> i see
[02:37:34] <rawtaz> i thought you meant elixir phoenix project :P
[02:38:33] <lantech19446> what is elixir pheonix project?
[02:40:12] <rawtaz> web framewpro
[02:40:14] <rawtaz> work*
[02:43:36] <lantech19446> o ok, no these are novels lol both of them are really good though
[02:47:58] <rawtaz> right
[02:49:09] <lantech19446> I think the guy who wrote them must have been in manufacturing or devops because he seems to have a thorough understanding of lean manufacturing and six sigma practices
[02:54:06] <rawtaz> mhm
[02:54:11] <rawtaz> the first book seems intereting
[02:54:15] <rawtaz> the second one not so much
[02:57:16] <lantech19446> i think it depends which practice you gravitate towards, the second book is the same story as the first book but from the dev side the first book is the ops story. I have to say I've really enjoyed them both equally but i'm much more drawn into the second one even though i've been working networking for so long

[16:38:25] <paws_> Hello. Trying to understand the exact benefit of getting an SSL certificate for my site. It's a web app that communicates with a 3d party backend already using https. This means that the only purpose of my certificate would be to authenticate my identity right?
[16:40:04] <paws_> i.e. that when users navigate to my site, they know that it's the real owner of the domain
[16:41:24] <paws_> ("my identity" is not correct really)
[16:46:10] <kwilczynski> Hi paws_.
[16:46:30] <kwilczynski> paws_: You mean, you want to get a TLS certificate for a web site/service you are hosting?
[16:46:55] <paws_> yes, a website
[16:47:08] <paws_> the frontend talks to a third party server (https)
[16:50:36] <kwilczynski> That's fine. And even better, as I'd imagine you want to keep your exchange with the other server somewhat private.
[16:52:20] <kwilczynski> As to whether it's OK or not to get a TLS for your own web site.
[16:52:25] <kwilczynski> You have to see the value yourself.
[16:52:26] <kwilczynski> https://www.hitechwhizz.com/2020/08/5-advantages-and-disadvantages-drawbacks-benefits-of-tls.html
[16:52:46] <kwilczynski> I would say - do it. Especially since it's free these days with Let's Encrypt and such.
[16:53:06] <paws_> that's the main question, isn't the exchange with the third party server already encrypted by calling it via https?
[16:53:15] <paws_> hmm
[16:53:18] <paws_> doesn't make sense does it
[16:53:31] <paws_> I need the certificate to encrypt what I send to the https server
[16:53:35] <kwilczynski> https://www.httpvshttps.com/
[16:53:48] <kwilczynski> Hosting H/2 is also nice thing to do.
[16:54:17] <kwilczynski> paws_: Between you and them, yes.
[16:54:32] <kwilczynski> paws_: Between me and your web site, it wouldn't be.
[16:54:44] <kwilczynski> paws_: There is no reason in almost 2022 not to use TLS. :)
[16:55:41] <kwilczynski> Some browsers will also raise an alarm about page not being encrypted, especially if you send some data from the client (web browser) to the server (sending a form making a POST, for example).
[16:55:51] <paws_> I "know" just trying to understand in detail (out of curiosity) what the certificate does in my specific case
[16:56:31] <kwilczynski> Your case - are you talking about your web site or the other third-party?
[16:56:39] <paws_> the third party is https
[16:56:47] <paws_> my site not yet
[16:56:47] <kwilczynski> Right.
[16:57:02] <paws_> so when my non https frontend talks to this https backend - is it encrypted?
[16:57:12] <kwilczynski> TLS offers encryption and authentication to put it in simple terms - you do know that?
[16:57:19] <paws_> yes
[16:57:39] <kwilczynski> paws_: If your client is capable of using TLS, and the end-point at the other company is using TLS, then yes.
[16:58:03] <paws_> doesn't it need to send the backend a public key? how does it do this without a certificate?
[16:59:15] <kwilczynski> If they are using a CA which signed their certificate that you might have available already on your system, then it does not need anything.
[16:59:27] <kwilczynski> How do you think you can connect to Google on https? :)
[16:59:42] <kwilczynski> You don't need to install their CA/chain and such.
[16:59:58] <kwilczynski> paws_: I recommend you read a bit more about how TLS works.
[17:00:05] <kwilczynski> Might help you understand the benefits better.
[17:00:51] <kwilczynski> https://www.internetsociety.org/deploy360/tls/basics/
[17:00:59] <kwilczynski> https://freecontent.manning.com/how-does-tls-work/
[17:01:07] <paws_> ah right - having the public key of the other party is enough. I encrypt the messages I send, and decrypt the messages I receive with their public key
[17:01:12] <kwilczynski> https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake/
[17:01:34] <kwilczynski> paws_: Only for the initial connetion.
[17:01:42] <kwilczynski> paws_: Then a dedicated session key will be established.
[17:01:54] <paws_> right..
[17:02:05] <kwilczynski> Cloudflare article has details.
[17:02:28] *** Joins: uvolmer (~uvolmer@2001-4dd0-212c-82-e069-f5f7-ab7b-8443.ipv6dyn.netcologne.de)
[17:02:28] <paws_> okay, so coming back to the initial question, my frontend needs the certificate only for the authentication part then - to prove that my host owns the domain 
[17:02:56] <paws_> I'll read the articles, thanks
[17:03:11] <kwilczynski> ... and validation, and encryption, and proof of origin, etc.
[17:03:22] <kwilczynski> paws_: Seriously Sir.
[17:03:43] <kwilczynski> paws_: Go to Let's Encrypt. Then set up everything for your domain, set up refresh as needed.
[17:03:56] <kwilczynski> paws_: Configure your HTTP server to securely use TLS.
[17:04:28] <kwilczynski> paws_: Run https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ over it and update setting until you get A+ or at least A.
[17:04:40] <paws_> but it doesn't need the certificate for encryption :) didn't we conclude that above
[17:04:58] <kwilczynski> paws_: Then congratulate yourself on a job well done, eat the cake.
[17:07:09] <paws_> ok yeah I was planning on creating the certificate anyway, as I said just wanted to understand
[17:07:11] <paws_> thanks
[17:07:28] <kwilczynski> paws_: These web sites I liked yo.
[17:07:30] <kwilczynski> to*
[17:07:37] <kwilczynski> Read at your leisure..
[17:07:51] <kwilczynski> It has a lot of insight.
[17:08:03] <kwilczynski> And there is no point of me just typing/telling you the same things.
[17:08:10] <kwilczynski> paws_: +1 for getting TLS certificate1
[17:08:31] <paws_> haha thanks ;)
