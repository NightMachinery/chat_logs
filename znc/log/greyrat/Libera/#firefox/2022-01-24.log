[05:49:47] <ulfvonbelow> is there a way to open a window on a different X screen (e.g. :0.1 instead of :0.0)? Whenever I try it with --new-window or --new-instance it just complains about an instance already running. I would like to have a window open on each X screen for convenience, since I can't move them between them.

[09:04:20] <causative_> suddenly my bookmarks sidebar is very slow, it hangs for multiple seconds after I click a link before it actually starts to load the link

[09:09:27] <causative_> the toolbar isn't slow when clicking on a bookmark, but it is slow when right clicking a folder for a context menu
[09:09:46] <causative_> whereas the sidebar is slow for everything, including clicking a bookmark
[09:09:56] <causative_> even scrolling it is slow
[09:11:20] <causative_> the rest of the browser is not slow
[09:11:41] <labrador> How many bookmarks do you have?
[09:12:26] <causative_> idk, maybe one or two hundred
[09:12:40] <labrador> uh yeah that might explain it
[09:12:56] <causative_> never been a problem before
[09:13:32] *** Joins: vlm (~vlm@user/vlm)
[09:13:41] <causative_> and I don't see why one or two hundred links with icons should cause a problem. that doesn't seem particularly large
[09:14:12] <labrador> It is pretty large,but idk why it suddenly became slow
[09:14:21] <labrador> Maybe try pruning some dead links
[09:18:01] <causative_> well now I've restarted firefox for the fourth or fifth time and suddenly it is not slow
[09:18:11] *** Quits: vlm (~vlm@user/vlm) (Client Quit)
[09:18:21] <causative_> oop, that didn't last, slow again
[09:18:26] <labrador> I don't think 96.0is the latest version too,maybe try updating
[09:19:34] <causative_> it's the newest on apt
[09:19:42] <causative_> 96.0+build2-0ubuntu0.20.04.1
[09:20:34] <labrador> Huh the newest one is 96.0.1
[09:20:49] <causative_> not on apt
[09:21:16] <labrador> ok
[09:22:50] <causative_> another restart of ff and it's again not slow, it's lasting longer this time
[09:23:12] <labrador> causative_, its maybe a bug with firefox
[09:23:40] <causative_> that's what I'd assume
[09:24:08] <labrador> but
[09:24:13] <causative_> can't think of anything else that would cause only one particular part of a program to be unreasonably slow, other than a bug in the program
[09:24:18] <labrador> Firs you should check on mozilla's latest flatpak
[09:24:31] <labrador> Maybe it works there,and ubuntu is the problem
[09:25:06] <causative_> but what could ubuntu have possibly done to package ff that would only affect the bookmarks?
[09:25:08] <labrador> Isn't firefox on ubuntu snaps anyway?
[09:25:12] <labrador> Thats a big change
[09:25:19] <labrador> They like chromium are now snaps
[09:25:26] <labrador> Snaps are slow
[09:25:47] <causative_> no it's not a snap
[09:26:58] <labrador> Maybe,but its a good idea to check on different sources
[09:27:27] <causative_> I mean the problem has stopped happening at least for now
[09:27:57] <labrador> hmm
[09:27:57] <causative_> so if I try another way of installing firefox and it works, that's not going to prove anything
[09:28:10] <labrador> It will prove that its not a bug in firefox
[09:28:22] <labrador> But with whatever ubuntu's doing with it
[09:28:30] <causative_> no, because if it's a bug in firefox it's an intermittent bug, if it works one time that shows nothing
[09:28:31] <labrador> but if it works for now its fine
[09:28:49] <labrador> you only need to reproduce it once
[09:29:14] <causative_> I don't know what are the conditions that would reproduce it
[09:29:40] <labrador> just try using the flatpak I guess,but only if it starts to slow down again

[21:49:38] <jdmark> does anyone have a better extension to darken web pages than "Dark Reader"
[21:49:54] <jdmark> I've used it for years but now it is mis-shading the input boxes

[22:08:49] <`St0ner> i'm interested in that too, dark reader slows my browsers to a crawl
