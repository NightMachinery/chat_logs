[00:29:50] <austincheney> onosendi, serverless is a broad term that can mean many different things
[00:32:32] <GreenJello> I think the immediate future is a mix of serverless and container orchestration, where the latter handles the stuff serverless doesn't, but in a more declarative way than traditional infrastructure, and with more flexibility
[00:34:22] <austincheney> I think current social media is driving a desire away from HTTP content responders, such as traditional websites.  One alternative is webRTC, but the distribution model proposed (TURN) is very expensive

[00:38:15] <theskillwithin> well usually a database is involved somewhere
[00:38:18] <lmat> I'm using react. My component has a `const [myVal, setMyVal] = useState(0); useEffect(()=> {setSomeState(myVal);... }, [props.whatever]);`. I need to render my component with certain props, interact with the component (to get it to set myVal to something) then RE-render my component with different props so that I can see test whether it does the useEffect properly. Does that make sense?
[00:39:04] <hassoon> lmat: #reactjs
[00:39:10] <austincheney> Alexendoo, to be more clear I mean to say social media is driving people and businesses away from the traditional web model.  People are getting tired of walled gardens and slower services despite rapid increases in bandwidth

[00:40:18] <rustyshackleford> theskillwithin: so lets say I've got a database and some other resources which are rest endpoints
[00:41:04] <rustyshackleford> lets make it simpler. two rest endpoints
[00:41:30] <rustyshackleford> you could use graphql to abstract those rest endpoints, and then its just one round trip for the client
[00:41:51] <rustyshackleford> is that any better than just calling those rest endpoints directly from client?

[00:49:24] <wroathe> Stanley: The basic idea behind event delegation is that you bind your event listener to a common ancestor to the elements whose events you want to handle
[00:50:09] <wroathe> Stanley: And then you make use of the event target, the .closest method to find the specific element the user is interacting with
[00:50:31] <Stanley> i'll check it out thanks :)

[00:51:02] <rustyshackleford> with the worst formatting and indentation you've ever seen

[03:44:11] <ljharb> austincheney: authoring in ESM is fine, shipping native ESM is not
[03:45:01] <austincheney> what kinds of problems are you guys encountering with shipping esm?
[03:45:34] <ljharb> it's a waterfall-based design. the browser can't know about dep 2 until it finishes parsing dep 1
[03:45:36] <ljharb> and so on
[03:45:49] <ljharb> also, it's new syntax, and new syntax is always slow til it gets optimized
[03:47:08] <austincheney> I am not seeing that slowness in my own application, but then its only sending about 16 js files to the browser
[03:48:50] <onosendi> ljharb: ah, figured out transpiling for node, that's what I wanted. Thanks.
[03:49:48] <ljharb> onosendi: make sure you're using babel, TS is a crappy transpiler :-)
[03:50:04] <ljharb> austincheney: the slowness will magnify significantly for someone with slow internet
[03:50:08] <ljharb> and/or a slow computer
[03:51:45] <cis> austincheney: you can test that in chrome devtools using throttling under the network tab

[03:54:49] <cis> ljharb: yeah, it's not perfect - you can simulate a slow CPU on the performance tab though
[03:55:36] <ljharb> TIL. not bad, haven't looked into it lately

[04:10:13] <Stanley> Yeah I replace with let
[04:10:24] <Stanley> querySelector() works like CSS selectors? any downfall?
[04:10:43] <systemfault> It's slower but you shouldn't select anything in a tight loop...

[10:01:21] <Puyo> i'm trying to use a Proxy to save to json whenever `data` gets modified, but it doesn't get ran? https://hastebin.com/wupebekowa.ts

[10:08:23] <Cork> Puyo: proxy is for the object you give it, not nested objects
[10:09:05] <Cork> if you change guildData.rolMenu.message to data.guilds = it works
[10:12:11] <Puyo> data.guilds is an array of objects, i need to .find()
[10:12:21] <Cork> Puyo: your missing the point
[10:12:25] <Puyo> oh wait
[10:12:26] <Puyo> i'm dumb
[10:12:27] <Puyo> nevermind
[10:12:32] <Cork> the proxy hangs on the object not all its children
[10:12:33] <Puyo> i think i get it
[10:12:55] <Cork> so you need a getter and it needs to wrap returned objects/arrays with a new proxy

[21:01:05] <jellobot> FlorianBad, "substr" is nonstandard/deprecated. "substring" can't handle negative indices, and weirdly sorts its arguments. "slice" works exactly as you'd expect, and identically to Array#slice. Always use slice on strings.
[21:01:54] <FlorianBad> jellobot: ah nice, thanks. So slice treats the string as an array of characters and doesn't reconstruct the whole thing?

[21:09:38] <FlorianBad> Basically what I'm doing is to parse a lot of string data that was encoded in a very custom way. So I have to go almost character by character. Should I try to store the position I'm at in a var rather than trying to reduce the string at every step?

[22:57:47] <FlorianBad> silly_: https://jsfiddle.net/m74L0ago/  so this is perfectly safe to declare `obj` like that and both `out` and `pointer` refer to the same thing?

[23:00:32] <FlorianBad> ok cool. So if I wanted to truly copy the data I would need to wrap it with {} ?  (and [] ) for copying an array?

[23:04:06] <FlorianBad> well, in my example the data is in memory only once, out and pointer actually point to the same memory space. If I wanted to separate them so that it's a true deep copy of the data I'd wrap things in {} or [] ?
[23:06:39] <GreenJello> there isn't a general way to deep clone things, and I don't see how wrapping would clone anything
[23:07:05] <GreenJello> you can do shallow clones with spread syntax
[23:07:16] <GreenJello> which is probably what you want here
[23:07:47] <silly_> he said deep copy
[23:08:24] <GreenJello> means the same thing as deep clone in JS
[23:08:33] <silly_> yes
[23:08:49] <silly_> it's like the opposite of shallow
[23:09:12] <GreenJello> you very rarely want to deep clone something
[23:09:23] <silly_> he said that
[23:09:52] <GreenJello> and I disagree that it's relevant here
[23:10:09] <GreenJello> there's nothing to deep clone
[23:10:23] <silly_> hugeObject.foo[2].bar[1]
[23:10:31] <FlorianBad> ok, that's a good thing becuase I only wanted to know how because I don
[23:10:35] <FlorianBad> 't actually want to ;)

[23:53:06] <GreenJello> only got 2 messages from you before that
[23:53:34] <GreenJello> seemed like you were maybe going to say more
[23:54:06] <linguist> Ohhh, yeah, but in my third message I just finished asking if anyone knows a way to test it on jest
[23:54:38] <linguist> Just so I understand, if I opt to mock it myself, I would write a replacement for window.requestAnimationFrame?
[23:54:47] <GreenJello> yes
[23:55:08] <linguist> And, can I replace objects like window?
[23:56:59] <ljharb> that's the global, so no
[23:57:23] <ljharb> in node you can provide it with jsdom, but if window is present a ton of stuff will assume it's a browser so you don't want to be making your own mock
