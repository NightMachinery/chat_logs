[01:20:19] <FromDiscord> <KatrinaKitten> The only way I can get it to work is if I separate it into an `eofImpl` and document the `let eof = eofImpl` instead, which is okay I guess, but a little annoying.

[01:58:05] <NimEventer> New thread by Sixte: F-bound polymorphism in C++ and(?) Nim , see https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/8728
[02:38:28] <FromDiscord> <KatrinaKitten> Is there a way to mark a `{.deprecated.}` a symbol, but only outside of the module it's defined in? For example, for something used internally which is exposed "just in case", but shouldn't be used if it can be avoided.
[02:38:37] <FromDiscord> <KatrinaKitten> (edit) "`{.deprecated.}` a symbol," => " symbol `{.deprecated.}`,"
[02:40:19] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> You could make it a template that has a macro that emits a warning used from outside the module
[02:41:48] <FromDiscord> <KatrinaKitten> It's already a macro, so that's one thing down; how would I check whether it's in the same module?

[02:47:43] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Probably want another parameter for `warningMessage`
[02:48:17] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> But that's the basic idea, what `someTemplate` does is what your macro needs to emit, and since your macro is emitting the code you might even be able to get the symbol and pass that node as a parameter to `warning`
[02:48:25] <FromDiscord> <KatrinaKitten> You know what I think I might do, I may just separate it into an internal and external version, only export the latter, and put the warning in there.
[02:48:41] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> "Fuck you beef" 😛

[04:28:23] <FromDiscord> <ynfle (ynfle)> The parameter `after` or `;`?
[04:29:15] <nixfreaknim[m]> after 
[04:29:44] <FromDiscord> <ynfle (ynfle)> AFAIK it's not a keyword and doesn't have special meaning. Where does that proc come from
[04:30:31] <nixfreaknim[m]> https://github.com/dariolah/nim-iup-examples/blob/master/niup/text.nim
[04:33:07] <FromDiscord> <ynfle (ynfle)> I don't think it has any special meaning
[04:33:12] <FromDiscord> <ynfle (ynfle)> It's just a parameter
[04:33:35] <FromDiscord> <Rosen> As far as I can figure out, that seems to be the signature of a callback function that you can attach to a text box. It needs to exist to be the valid signature of the callback, but in this particular case it doesn't do anything
[04:33:59] <FromDiscord> <Rosen> Looks like you'd have to go looking in the IUP docs to find out what the "action" callback on a text object does
[04:35:07] <FromDiscord> <ynfle (ynfle)> What he said ☝
[04:35:11] <FromDiscord> <ynfle (ynfle)> \they
[04:38:26] <nixfreaknim[m]> Ok thanks
[04:41:33] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It's not even a callback, it's just a cstring passed to the invoked proc
[04:44:06] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> So in this case `after` is just the text in the text box
[04:44:21] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> `after` is called `new_val` in the docs
[05:03:23] <nixfreaknim[m]> so after represents the text in the box? 
[05:03:37] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I think so
[05:03:43] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I could be wrong
[05:03:55] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> I'm not an infallible vat of knowledge sadly
[05:04:45] <nixfreaknim[m]> yeah I'm so disappointed lol 
[05:05:19] <nixfreaknim[m]> so after must be a keyword word then , cause it doesn't come up anywhere else in the program

[05:51:49] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> config.nims is how you do it

[16:08:16] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> we still need something that is good with tabular like data, with columns and whatnot

[16:09:27] <pippin> in that vein, my first experiment with nim is a wrapper for modern vector graphics the terminal way https://ctx.graphics/file/demos/nim/ctx2d.nim.html

[16:14:57] <FromDiscord> <hmmm> honesty anything with bindings is boring to write and read. Ideally we should have something nim native that is easy to write but complete and not toylike. It's indeed a massive undertaking

[16:17:31] <FromDiscord> <Rika> In reply to @hmmm "honesty anything with bindings": If the wrapper is done right then it would be transparent from a regular pure Nim library

[21:17:20] <FromDiscord> <auxym> In reply to @tbrekalo "Also; is something like": See here: https://nim-lang.org/docs/iterators.html#fieldPairs.i%2CT types in Nim only exist at compile-time, at run time everything is just data, so if you're operating on types, you have to use `when` or other compile-time mechanics (template, macros, etc)
[21:17:57] <FromDiscord> <tbrekalo> thanks
[21:20:54] <FromDiscord> <auxym> About move, sink, etc: in all cases they are never required I believe, just an optimization for the GC you can optionally use. https://nim-lang.org/docs/destructors.html#move-semantics says `This property is computed by a static control flow analysis but can also be enforced by using system.move explicitly`. Whether you should enforce it here, not sure, I haven't used these much myself, just leave everything on auto.
[21:23:23] <FromDiscord> <auxym> In reply to @tbrekalo "thanks": Also, you can use `1'i32'`/`i'u32` or `int32(1)`/`uint32(1)` or `1.int32`/`1.uint32` for creating literal (u)int32s. Casts are unsafe so best avoided unless you really need them and know what you are doing (reinterpreting raw binary data).
[21:26:24] <FromDiscord> <tbrekalo> In reply to @auxym "Also, you can use": I am kinda annoyed by the fact that there's not parseUInt32 in std
[21:28:56] <FromDiscord> <auxym> agreed, though unless you are running this on an 8bit or 16bit micro, `parseUint(s).uint32` should be equivalent. Since your system `uint` will be either 32 or 64.
[21:30:39] <FromDiscord> <tbrekalo> @auxym , can you help me a bit with nim's move semantics?↵Should move be used when assigning the `sink` param to part of the result variable as in the example I posted above?
[21:31:16] <FromDiscord> <auxym> Yeah, really not familiar with that stuff, sorry.
