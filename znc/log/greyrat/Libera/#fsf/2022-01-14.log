[04:13:38] <jacobk> I think, if you are going to send cash to someone in the US to have them buy a membership for you, I think it would be better to send it directly to the FSF. Even if it's not listed as an option, they might accept it if you ask them (not 100% sure how you would ask though).
[04:14:17] <jacobk> There are lots of other options on Bisq, but it's confusing to try to figure out which ones are even possible to use without proprietary software.

[07:48:39] <DiffieHellman> jacobk: No, but you can quickly find out by disabling JavaScript
[07:49:05] <DiffieHellman> All decent websites work without JavaScript, so if any website stops working, it's time to stop visiting :D
[07:49:44] *** Joins: realz (~realz@user/realz)
[07:50:41] <jacobk> Yes I know, but it would be good to have a better way to find new sites that work without JavaScript, since most sites don't advertize themselves as LibreJS-compatible.
[07:51:37] <jacobk> If it was FSD-style, then it could also document ways to interact with the site with 3rd party software, or whether the site allows Tor users to connect.
[07:52:13] <DiffieHellman> My browser of choice is Tor Browser with no JS, so ehh
[07:56:28] <jacobk> How do you find new sites, if you're looking for something specific?
[07:57:18] <jacobk> e.g. social media site with no js, online shopping with no js, etc. (maybe those aren't the best examples lol)
[07:57:45] <jacobk> most search engines don't have a filter for nojs as far as I know

[08:01:02] <DiffieHellman> Sometimes the text is in the page, but hidden. I guess search engines are now running JS

[08:31:02] <jacobk> DiffieHellman: Do you install extensions or log in to web services when using Tor? I've considered using Tor Browser as my primary browser (with LibreJS instead of no js), but I've heard that it's a bad idea to install extensions and sign into accounts when using Tor Browser, so I haven't switched.
[08:31:39] <DiffieHellman> I don't really need any extensions, but I've been tempted to install a dark theme setting one.
[08:32:30] <DiffieHellman> You can log in just fine really, you just have to be careful to not log into separate accounts in the same session, or even near the same time if that site doesn't get many visitors
[08:33:57] <jacobk> I have 19 extensions :D
[08:35:01] <jacobk> Most of them are unimportant, and the ones that aren't are mostly based on fixing problems that JavaScript creates.
[08:35:14] <DiffieHellman> Now that's some good fingerprinting
[08:36:20] <jacobk> But, it seems odd to me that websites should be able to get the list of extensions I have without using JavaScript.
[08:37:42] <jacobk> EFF's "Cover Your Tracks" tools says I have "strong protection", but I know it could be missing something.

[09:05:30] *** Joins: ElectronApps (~ElectronA@user/electronapps)
[09:06:54] <jacobk> I just tried it again, this time with NoScript allowing the scripts through but LibreJS blocking them, and I ended up in a redirect loop.
[09:06:54] <jacobk> So, maybe you have to have either JavaScript enabled or allow all their scripts.
[09:07:33] <jacobk> Actually, I had whitelisted the inline script, and forgetting it fixes the problem, so that's probably not the problem you're having/
[09:08:32] <jacobk> AndrewYu: Where does it break? Does it show the website but not let you test, or are you completely blocked from loading the site?
[09:08:55] <jacobk> https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/ is the URL I'm using.

[09:46:57] <AndrewYu> Yes, the same URL for me
[09:47:29] <jacobk> looping after you click the test button, right?
[09:48:08] <jacobk> Since I ran into that issue with a specific configuration of LibreJS, I would guess that an extension is causing the problem.
[09:48:08] <AndrewYu> Yup
[09:48:14] <AndrewYu> I also think so
[09:48:37] <AndrewYu> I'm not going to disable LibreJS though, maybe I'll run it in a container and test it later
[09:49:16] <jacobk> Yeah, you shouldn't have to disable LibreJS. But, maybe try (temporarily) disabling JavaScript entirely and see if that fixes it.

[09:53:00] <AndrewYu> JShelter, Ublock origin, noscript (temp off)
[09:56:39] <jacobk> I have JShelter installed at level 2, but I've never used Ublock origin (that could be configured to block pretty much anything, right? Is there a way to check if Ublock is blocking anything at the eff domains?).
[09:57:00] <AndrewYu> I see it's not blocking anything there
[09:57:26] <AndrewYu> (I'm in advanced mode and can see when yellow strips occur (blocked stuff).  I manually whitelisted JS in ublock for eff.
[09:57:32] <AndrewYu> Odd, i'll come back later
[10:02:16] <jacobk> Something odd I noticed: I have accessibility.blockautorefresh enabled, so I get a prompt on redirects, and when I open CYT with LibreJS, it seems that if I don't redirect *fast* enough, then I get stuck in a loop (no loop possible when NoScript is blocking all scripts).
[10:03:08] <AndrewYu> Yup, that's how i ended up with
[10:03:50] <AndrewYu> I see random scripts popping up in librejs, one time i got to read it before it refreshes, it's okay so I decided to whitelist it, but got no luck pressing the whitelist button (refreshed too fast)

[19:23:23] <labrador> Its speed is in the middle too. Its memory safety and speed makes it a good option for servers

[23:13:23] <mcss> the javascript code
[23:13:40] <mcss> if it's free one can view it, roght?
[23:13:43] <mcss> right
[23:14:26] <craigt> mcss: Javascript can be minified and licensed as nonfree.
[23:15:13] <craigt> mcss: Just because one can view it, doesn't necessarily make it free.
[23:15:16] <[[> craigt, mcss: GitLab.com uses reCAPTCHA, which is nonfree
[23:15:37] <jacobk> Hm when I go to https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in I see "Please turn JavaScript on and reload the page.", and I get a different script on each refresh.
[23:15:59] <odoood> mcss: yes, but that's also true for non-free JS -- the way to "see" it is via your browser development tools
[23:16:04] <mcss> jacobk: how can you check that?
[23:17:20] <jacobk> LibreJS can show the blocked scripts, so I copy/pasted the script into the text editor, and then refreshed and copy/pasted into a different file, then compared the files.

[23:18:49] <jacobk> (that's not the whole script, but that's one part that's different).
[23:19:24] <jacobk> It's just a difference of data and not code I think, but it makes whitelisting the script in LibreJS impossible.

[23:21:44] <jacobk> Actually, the script with just different data is meant to call a much larger script that's also different each time: https://gitlab.com/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/h/b/orchestrate/jsch/v1?ray=6cd95d142a842f0d vs https://gitlab.com/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/h/b/orchestrate/jsch/v1?ray=6cd95c292e252f0d in this case.
[23:22:09] <mcss> ok, interesting
[23:22:38] <mcss> so what does gnu mean when they say that the JS code is free?
[23:23:29] <jacobk> I think it's outdated information
[23:24:18] <odoood> it's def outdated the score is from 2015
[23:24:33] <mcss> ok, but we can at least agree that gitlab is better than github, right?
[23:24:46] <mcss> in terms of freedom
[23:25:01] <jacobk> Actually, the same ray= does not mean you get the same large script; try going to either of the links in my message and refreshing.
[23:25:11] <odoood> mcss: lol well if your criteria is based on whether it uses nonfree JS then maybe not
[23:26:04] <jacobk> mcss: No, GitHub allows for lots of functionality without JS at all. Even browsing GitLab issues requires JS.
[23:26:39] <kompowiec> not to mention to required account to search gitlab :/
[23:26:56] <jacobk> I think creating an account on either one requires nonfree JS, but anonymous access on GitHub works almost entirely without JS I think.
[23:27:41] <kompowiec> IMO gitea is better
[23:27:57] <jacobk> Yes, definitely
[23:28:30] <mcss> isn't that self hosted?
[23:28:32] <craigt> This is also happening https://libreplanet.org/wiki/FSF_forge_evaluation
[23:29:27] <kompowiec> mcss, does exists instance https://gitea.com/

[23:29:37] <odoood> craigt: awesome
[23:29:37] <craigt> Alright everybody. Thanks again for another fine meeting. fsdbot is about to chime in.
[23:29:53] <tfisgnag> Thank you
[23:30:07] <craigt> tfisgnag: Oh hi! 
[23:30:10] <fsdbot> The Free Software Directory meeting stops now. If it is your first time joining us, please check out the participation guide: https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Participate
[23:30:36] <tfisgnag> craigt: Hi:]
[23:30:45] <[[> GitLab.com also uses cloudflare and reCAPTCHA
[23:30:49] <jacobk> "GNU ethical repo criteria: gitlab.com listed as C, but has been operating at an F and will be reclassified soon"
[23:31:01] *** Joins: Noisytoot (~noisytoot@sourcehut/user/noisytoot)
[23:31:08] <odoood> sounds about right
[23:32:39] <jacobk> That seems like a pretty critical issue tbh, to say "All JavaScript code served to the client is free" when that is not the case; it may lead some users to whitelist the gitlab.com domain in LibreJS.
[23:32:52] <mcss> so let's say I want to use GPL code for my project. I open an account on a git hosting website, put my code on there with the GPL license. Do I have to do anything else?
[23:33:31] <kompowiec> technically nothing
[23:34:05] <mcss> I don't have to add a notice for the project I took the code from?
[23:34:11] <mcss> like BSD
[23:35:08] <odoood> you gotta look at what the license requires
[23:35:34] <mcss> I'm talking about the GPL license
[23:35:42] <kompowiec> I assume the libraries you use will be in the program.
[23:36:08] <kompowiec> if you're sharing under the same license, you should be fine.

[23:37:59] *** zaher_ is now known as zaher
[23:38:44] <mcss> if the original code has GPLv2 license, can I license my fork as GPLv3 or AGPL?
[23:39:39] <jacobk> (only if it's GPLv2-or-later, I think)
[23:40:15] <kompowiec> indeed
