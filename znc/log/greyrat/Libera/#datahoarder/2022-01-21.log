[00:03:33] <skye0> joepie91 i'd love to have food delivered to me but i think it'll be far cheaper if i bought it or grew it myself
[00:03:42] <joepie91> oh, this is definitely not cheap
[00:03:50] <joepie91> I'm trying to buy off my executive dysfunction issues :)
[00:04:44] <skye0> üëçÔ∏è
[00:05:56] <skye0> another reason that the "screw all men" attitude to tumblr appeals to me is kind of my mother's very occasional bootlicking of men. doesn't manifest too much, but she said that a boy was badly behaved because "he didn't have a father". personally i consider my parents killjoys and my mother's gender policing will drive me up the wall someday. so far, only the pandemic reactions by anti-vaxers and anti-maskers are really infuriating me
[00:06:15] <skye0> i'd also probably be more angry and irritated in general if not for the meds i started around monday or so
[00:06:50] <skye0> trying to find a job where i can be a bit more myself perhaps, idk
[00:06:59] <joepie91> sarnold: there, just talked to support and suggested they print an at-a-glance timeline on the recipe cards
[00:07:02] <joepie91> let's see what happens
[00:07:38] <sarnold> joepie91: good idea :)
[00:07:50] <joepie91> like, seriously, that'd probably pretty much fix it
[00:08:16] <sarnold> and definitely agreed, blue apron, hello fresh, etc are *not* cheap compared to 'usual home cooking'
[00:08:46] <sarnold> it's not bad compared against restaurant prices, but then you don't usually prepare or clean up afterwards when you go to a restaurant :)
[00:09:15] <sarnold> but it does reduce how often I go to the grocery store, and *that* reduces how often I have junk food in the house
[00:09:40] <sarnold> so in addition to offering a wider variety of much healither foods, it also reduces the amount of unhealthy foods I have
[00:10:24] <joepie91> sarnold: for me the reason is more that it reduces cooking from a three-step process to a one-step process; instead of "pick recipes that are sufficiently compatible so I can make them for 1 person without throwing away ingredients" and then "go out and buy them" and "use them in cooking before they go bad", I now only have the last step left
[00:10:35] <joepie91> time-managing those three steps has historically been a shitshow for me
[00:10:40] <joepie91> and there's deadlines on each of them
[00:10:52] <joepie91> that all interconnect and aaaaaaa
[00:11:40] <joepie91> with this approach, hopefully the only thing I have to worry about will be "remembering to start cooking *before* it's almost bedtime"
[00:12:03] <sarnold> joepie91: that shitshow is exactly how I wound up eating crackers and cheese, or crackers and peanut butter and jam, or eggs with toast, etc, for a few years ...
[00:12:09] <joepie91> yeuuuup
[00:12:11] <sarnold> joepie91: *YES*
[00:12:22] <sarnold> joepie91: so long as I start cooking dinner by 8pm, I'm golden!
[00:12:29] <joepie91> heh :)
[00:12:34] <sarnold> joepie91: which, incidentally, also helps me stop work at a more reasonable hour
[00:12:35] <joepie91> ADHD is wild yo
[00:15:39] <evilgohan2> oof
[00:17:11] <joepie91> it's especially bizarre for me because I am notoriously good at connecting disparate bits of information into a complex web of information and relationships and causal chains all in my head without taking notes
[00:17:23] <joepie91> but the moment I need to schedule interdependent chores, oh boy
[00:17:28] <ThePendulum> would've been looking forward to friday if we didn't have to go to my sister's boyfriend birthday to eat 4 day old cake
[00:17:42] <joepie91> it's like a switch flips
[00:18:12] <evilgohan2> it's a gift and a curse
[00:18:16] <evilgohan2> because when I focus in on something
[00:18:19] <evilgohan2> boy do I focus in on it
[00:18:34] <evilgohan2> but that knife definitely cuts both ways.
[00:18:45] <joepie91> yeah...
[00:18:59] <ThePendulum> joepie91: what stove type do you use
[00:19:18] <joepie91> gas thingem
[00:20:36] <ThePendulum> ah, at least more controllable than electric
[00:20:41] <ThePendulum> raw for an hour and suddenly it's on fire lol
[00:20:57] <ThePendulum> and then the breaker pops
[00:21:03] <joepie91> if you mean induction, not necessarily
[00:21:08] <joepie91> just requires a different approach
[00:21:11] <ThePendulum> not induction, like a resistive coil
[00:21:12] <joepie91> and ehhhhhh
[00:21:15] <joepie91> ah right
[00:21:25] <ThePendulum> induction is alright if you have the right pans
[00:21:31] <joepie91> was gonna say, if induction makes a breaker pop, you PROBABLY want to hire an electrician like, yesterday, lol
[00:21:42] <joepie91> not that it's much better with resistive
[00:21:48] <joepie91> but also resistive stoves fucking suck just generally
[00:21:50] <sarnold> I've got the resistive coil cooktop and it works okay
[00:22:03] <sarnold> I'd lvoe to replace it with inductive to make cleanup way less pain
[00:22:17] <ThePendulum> we've had induction for over a decade, only thing I'm worried about now is cracking it
[00:22:33] <sarnold> ooh nice
[00:22:34] <ThePendulum> heavy steel pans near a glass plate....
[00:22:38] <sarnold> yeah
[00:22:48] <sarnold> but glass is also really impressive at times
[00:22:55] <ThePendulum> before the kitchen got renovated we had a plate with a chip and a crack for years lol
[00:23:33] <joepie91> I mean, induction stoves are specifically designed - or should be, anyway - to not have that issue
[00:23:42] <joepie91> ThePendulum: also, if you want induction, try the portable IKEA one
[00:23:50] <joepie91> it's quite good
[00:24:04] <joepie91> https://www.ikea.com/nl/nl/p/tillreda-draagbare-inductiekookplaat-2-zones-wit-30497094/
[00:24:05] <joepie91> that one I believe
[00:24:17] <ThePendulum> that's cheaper than I expected
[00:24:18] <joepie91> just goes in the power socket
[00:24:25] <ThePendulum> I guess they look fancier than they really are
[00:24:33] <joepie91> yeah :)
[00:24:42] <joepie91> there's also a 1 pit one: https://www.ikea.com/nl/nl/p/tillreda-draagbare-inductiekookplaat-1-zone-wit-10486794/
[00:24:46] <joepie91> at about half the price
[00:24:52] <joepie91> so two of the single one may be easier
[00:25:29] <sarnold> well that looks sharp
[00:25:30] <joepie91> we use these at revspace
[00:25:43] <joepie91> for communal cooking
[00:25:43] <ThePendulum> hm needing two sockets and all the cables probably make the two in one unit more useful
[00:25:53] <joepie91> depends on how big your pans are :)
[00:26:33] <ThePendulum> you'd put two pans on one pit?
[00:26:57] <joepie91> no, but if your pans are big, they can crowd each other out on a small stove
[00:27:03] <joepie91> I have that problem with my current stove
[00:27:18] <joepie91> it doesn't 'offset' the big burners, both are on one side
[00:27:23] <joepie91> super impractical when cooking with eg. two frying pans
[00:27:58] <joepie91> there's a very good reason why a lot of stoves have the big burners diagonally across from each other, basically :)
[00:28:08] <ThePendulum> oh like that
[00:28:29] <skye0> i'm still fucking hungry but i'm having to put up with what my parents feed me
[00:28:37] <sarnold> joepie91: it bothers my sense of symmetry ..
[00:28:49] <skye0> i could cook, too lazy and i never feel like i have much time too. ready meals are expensive
[00:29:02] <ThePendulum> we have one with the built in smoke extractor now
[00:29:23] <skye0> had rice and fish in tomato sauce and an omelette (separately), and then coffee. i'll maybe make more coffee, idk
[00:29:39] <joepie91> sarnold: it's just diagonal symmetry :p
[00:30:59] <sarnold> joepie91: so.. if i stand in my kitchen at a diagonal...
[00:31:17] <joepie91> :)
