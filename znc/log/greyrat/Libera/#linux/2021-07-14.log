[00:03:06] <FlorianBad> I had a crazy idea but I wonder if that's even possible, and if so, how?  I want to code a system that simulates a usb 3.1 usb drive (USB mass storage) so I can plug that into any computer and it shows as a drive, but behind the scene what it really is is the FUSE library and I then do my things over the network to have these files be in reality
[00:03:06] <FlorianBad> remote. So question is, how to simulate USB 3.1? Could a Raspberry Pi do it?
[00:03:24] <akik> but i'm still lnot sure if that just mounts that partition so it's visible

[00:13:27] <Meisterbrau> cant remember

[00:13:46] <simbaclaws> usually there is the first linux option, which is boot your linux as is, with the current kernel. And then there is a second linux option to go into advanced linux booting options and there you should be able to select a older kernel

[12:07:32] <curdlesnoot> TomyWork: not necessarily, no. see ~/.cache/fontconfig, for example. the only implication of running fc-cache for the user-managed font directories is that the applicable caches are created up-front.
[12:07:40] <curdlesnoot> rather than on-demand.

[12:09:14] <curdlesnoot> in other words, if you want to start from a clean slate, empty the cache directory and just carry on as normal.
[12:09:40] <TomyWork> according to one debian bug i read (I'm on ubuntu, but it's probably the same here), fc-cache create caches for 64-bit applications, while 32-bit applications have a 1-time startup delay

[12:11:01] <TomyWork> I now cleaned both the system-wide and user-specific cache and did a "sudo fc-cache -r"
[12:11:19] <curdlesnoot> that sounds plausible, as the caches are architecture-specific.

[12:12:17] <curdlesnoot> perhaps the caches are not named in a way that distinguishes one architecture from another. that would be a curious oversight, I would say.
[12:12:29] <Kyv> TomyWork: the -r option will clean up those files for you.
[12:12:43] <TomyWork> Kyv, nope, it doesn't

[12:12:48] <TomyWork> it also recreates them
[12:13:01] <Kyv> yeah

[12:13:24] <TomyWork> ok, now "/usr/lib/libreoffice/share/fonts/truetype" just popped up in my user cache

[12:15:44] <curdlesnoot> you may only have a 64-bit built of fc-cache but the 32-bit fontconfig library should just compose the caches as it goes along.
[12:17:22] <TomyWork> yes the file names are distinct
[12:17:38] <TomyWork> which issue are you saying you dont think exists?
[12:17:56] <curdlesnoot> "perhaps the caches are not named in a way that distinguishes one architecture from another", following on from your initial comments.

[12:25:52] <Guest53> I'm trying to install grub onto an unencrypted fat32 partition and I keep getting the error "attempt to install to encrypted disk without cryptodisk enabled. Set 'GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=y' in file '/etc/default/grub'". I am using luks+lvm on the rest of the linux partitions but from what I understand, that flag is for when the boot partition is

[12:50:31] <Guest53> The system I'm installing Linux onto has a single hard drive and an existing Windows install so I was trying to repurpose Window's EFI partition for grub but that only has 100mb of space. If it needs to be 512mb, I guess I'll have to go back to shifting partitions around. I may make /boot unencrypted as you say though. That could be easier
[12:51:44] <curdlesnoot> 100 MiB is definitely pushing it for dual-booting. you might just get away with it if you're using a distribution that tends towards only have one kernel/initramfs pair installed at a time.
[12:52:14] <curdlesnoot> it's frustrating that Windows makes it that small. as I recall, it's fairly greedy with it too.

[12:53:05] <curdlesnoot> I should add that 512 MiB is just a lower bound that I've found to be comfortable in practice. it doesn't need to be that but, obviously, it needs to be enough to acommodate anything that's going to be written into it in the future.
[12:53:24] <EdwardIII> 512 for a boot partition curdlesnoot?

[13:56:50] <Guest53> TomyWork: I don't care about encrypting /boot, but I only had a 100 mb EFI partition which isn't enough space for all of /boot. I didn't want to move partitions in order to free enough space to resize the partition or create a new EFI partition and waste that 100 mb of space. I thought grub only needed access to ESP files on startup anyway so I
[13:56:50] <Guest53> decided to just mount the 100 mb EFI partition to /boot/efi and make the grub install target there but apparently grub needs access to the files stored in /boot as well, meaning that if I want to keep the bootloader unencrypted, I need to either resize the 100 mb EFI partition or create another unencrypted partition for /boot. I don't like the idea
[13:56:51] <Guest53> of that much complexity so my plan right now is to figure out how to shift partitions over so that I am able to resize the 100 mb EFI partition to 512 mb and mount it unencrypted as /boot.

[19:19:46] <schuelermine> you mean you want a downloading utility?
[19:19:47] <jason1234> (no ssl)
[19:19:54] <jim> is that like wget?
[19:20:11] <jason1234> yeahp a httpcget.c or something , to download

[19:20:49] <jason1234> in C so that I can compile it with GCC, and httpget ...
[19:20:54] <schuelermine> or are you unable to download anything due to the lack of wget?
[19:21:04] <schuelermine> jason1234: so a library?

[19:21:32] <Kyv> I just use alsa and it is fine for desktop use. The only pulse-related package that needs kept is libpulse for certain applications' pulseaudio dependency.
[19:21:51] <djph> jason1234: what do you expect this "httpget.c" file to do for you?
[19:22:01] <jim> schuelermine, anyway, it looks like you have something like 5-7 different choices of -what- to set up so you can record whatever, and people are saying you can do it at the level of the alsa driver

[19:24:37] <Dagmar> jason1234: Also, I strongly recommend against trying to add your own C function for downloading a file from some rando URL.  You can easily call curl/wget externally, and then dealing with any potential changes to the ssl functions becomes _their_ maintenance problem, not yours.

[20:01:50] <Psi-Jack> It is a Linux distribution technically. Just Android/Linux, rather than GNU/Linux.
[20:01:54] <Dagmar> because they're not trying to build a Linux workstation or a Linux server or even a Linux appliance
[20:01:54] <The_Blode> Hey Tux
[20:01:56] <Dagmar> They use the kernel.
[20:02:05] <archlinu1> The_Blode hey
[20:02:09] <gspbirel56> NetBSD uses BSD packages but there is GNU as well. I'm just curious on your perspective because I would consider Android more of a Linux distro than a BSD
[20:02:27] <Dagmar> Pretty much everything past that that is similar to what's in a Linux distribution is only similar out of luck and convenience
[20:02:28] <gspbirel56> Not that it matters really

I see Linux Mint in my F drive, not sure exactly where that is, but im seeing it here from microsoft side. Also have old USB from old computer and have ISO burned on that little USB, also have USB harddrive for this computer and have Linux Mint burned on that but thats in another location.

[20:03:34] <Dagmar> ...and this is not a matter of it quietly running `java somejar.jar` in the background
[20:03:40] <Psi-Jack> Android is a distribution of Android/Linux, Khaytsus , That is literal undeniable fact.

[20:04:15] <Meisterbrau> also wondering if this is firmware issue or outdated bios issue?

[21:39:54] <The_Blode> If possible...maybe youtube-dl?
[21:40:08] <Dagmar> lowin: Honestly the easier and safer way is just to point your resolver at some server on the far side of the VPN that already knows about .internal
[21:40:16] <schillingklaus> the problem is avoided by using a systemd-free distro
[21:40:16] <lowin> Dagmar, I tried to do this but I couldn't make it work. the tutorials on the internet I found are all for *.domain.tld zone which assumes domain.tld is mastered by the current bind9 server. but forgwarding a whole zone doesn't work
[21:40:31] <The_Blode> Oh 144p
[21:40:41] <The_Blode> What about youtube-dl?
[21:40:42] <lowin> Dagmar, unfortunately the other server doesn't have access to internet to resolve the rest of the domain names
[21:40:58] <The_Blode> Maybe YouTube is throttled by the hotel.
[21:41:00] <Dagmar> lowin: When you do this, you basically _are_ telling the nameserver that it's authoritative for your bogus tld

[22:20:40] <lowin> Dagmar, I've read the thread but couldn't find what I'm doing wrong. I think the problem should be elsewhere because I can't get either of forward or stub zone to work at all.

[23:24:21] <Dagmar> Seiryuu: The last _serious_ deviation for that was back like, 20 years ago when Dell would ship and entire line of monitors with the same EEPROM in them, so basically the 15", 17" and 19" monitors all told the computer they were 15"
[23:24:46] <Guest71> sorry i wont im used to other chats ill try not to
