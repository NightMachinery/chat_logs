[02:43:35] <curdlesnoot> I realise that you're not intending to do so, but you are. it is categorially impossible for the problem to be precisely the same as it was before, if you have altered the spelling of the command name. you omitted the nature of the problem the first time by not reporting the error message. at 'best', the new command would not be resolved, with a similar - but different error message.
[02:43:38] <pasiz> strace would get you on tracks
[02:43:46] <curdlesnoot> at worst, you will have encountered a new problem, which - by definition - is not the same as the initial problem.

[03:56:17] <Shariff> Is there a way to delay during boot the startup of certain services? Right now, docker is starting way to fast, so fast that the system hasn't initialized the mounts from fstab  yet
[03:56:27] <bilb_ono> if a process pushes to stdout multiple times (like in a for loop) and you use >> new_file, and you tail -f new_file, you won’t see anything if that origianl process errors out half way through right?
[03:57:08] <kfrench> bilb_ono: Google says to put in the systemd file for your service
[03:57:11] <kfrench> er, ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 30
[03:58:06] <bilb_ono> I think thats t Shariff ?
[03:58:18] <kfrench> bilb_ono: oops, sorry.
[03:58:59] <Shariff> Thanks!
[03:59:33] <kfrench> bilb_ono: That'll depend on if your app caches its output to stdout.  If it doesn't, or has a flush(), then the tail -f will see everything up until it errors out
[04:00:25] <curdlesnoot> bilb_ono: you will. a program can't emit output then take it 'back'. the only way it could happen at that point is if the reader closed the pipe or otherwise elected to discard what it had read.

[04:00:52] <bilb_ono> hmm

[04:02:36] <Shariff> That sounds good.. right now the docker is starting and the containers are starting too, but they have issues with certain bind mounts, because the mounts in fstab didn't mount yet..
[04:02:36] <azizLIGHT> how do these permissions and ownership worked? root made backup of user's home dir, including .ssh/ (user:user and chmod 777), the tar.gz is owned by root:root and 644. when www-data extracted it, the resulting files owned by www-data:www-data and the user's .ssh dir is also www-data:www-data and chmod 700, granting access to user's id_rsa file. how to avoid this
[04:02:56] <Shariff> kfrench: what would be the moutingservicethingy.. for mount -a? just that?
[04:03:03] <curdlesnoot> bilb_ono: actually, there is one case in which it could happen. if the writer elected to close file descriptor 1 before exiting. that would be most unusual, to say the least.

[04:50:23] <Psi-Jack> Hmmm.. There's one thing that currently elludes me in a current Linux related issue, that I actually haven't found a solution to as of yet. heh. I've got a Lenovo Yoga tabtop. It's plugged into a USB-C j5 Create dock primarily for Wired Ethernet Networking, and I'd like to use it for audio output as well, but for some reason the audio output isn't working at all. Only if I plug the audio jack directly into the laptop's port.

Appeal to nature is generally not good (see: social Darwinism, which tl;dr is bad), but in the case of language it's hard to stay elegant and not borrow a little – or, fiine, a lot – from existing natural language :)
[10:13:28] <Gustavo6046> It's a bit of a tangential example, but it's a good example nonetheless

[10:14:37] <Gustavo6046> Computers evolve, and so do their computation architectures and their logic paths; and yet lots of people still use languages from the 70s and 80s. Modern languages are often seen as inelegant because, in the reasonable strife of being succint, they end up in unfamiliar territory to the majority of programmers.
[10:15:14] <Gustavo6046> Usually in situations like those two, the best way to proceed is a middle ground, like dipping your feet in the waters to see if they're not gonna eat you alive. But what is the middle ground between a PDP-11 and a modern RISC-V?

[11:06:24] <nvz> fdan: 2 and 1 are file descriptors for stderr and stdout respectively
[11:06:24] <pnbeast> fdan, I'd also recommend that you ask your real question, instead of asking an "XY question".  You usually get better answers that way.
[11:06:36] <hexnewbie> fdan: 1 and 2 are file descriptors (i.e. the numbers of open files)
[11:07:02] <hexnewbie> the numbers referring to specific open files (not necessarily named ones)
[11:07:20] <fdan> nvz suppose if the command > /dev/null 2>&1; lets say the "command" had errored out, where can i get to know what the logs it errored out
[11:07:54] <nvz> if you want to keep but not see the output, then you don't want /dev/null
[11:08:00] <hexnewbie> fdan: To get the output, you wouldn't redirect (discard) the errors to /dev/null
[11:08:22] <nvz> you just use a regular file
[11:08:32] <fdan> ok command > 2&1 should suffice?
[11:08:39] <nvz> no
[11:08:47] <fdan> here if it errors out, i can see the error in 2

[11:19:15] <fdan> curdlesnoot i see this https://dpaste.org/Ovnt
[11:19:39] <hexnewbie> fdan: Nope, the standard output is redirected to a file named "log.file" (its file descriptor, 1, is replaced with a newly opened file "log.file"), and the standard error is redirected to the (newly opened) standard output (its file descriptor, 2, is replaced with the already open file from file descriptor 1)
[11:20:14] <curdlesnoot> fdan: so, you have the standard file descriptors 0 through 2. fd 0 (stdin) has your terminal open for reading, and both 1 (stdout) and 2 (stderr) have your terminal open for writing.
[11:20:59] <fdan> hexnewbie hmm.. i miss the concept from the file descriptor 1

[11:21:30] <curdlesnoot> fdan: it's useful to have two distinct output streams. that's why stdout and stderr exist distinctly.
[11:21:51] <curdlesnoot> fdan: anyway, try running: ls -l /proc/self/fd > log.file; cat log.file
[11:22:01] <nvz> thats also why you can talk shit out of both ends :P
[11:22:36] <hexnewbie> fdan: When a UNIX program opens a file, the result is a number (e.g. 7), which is used to refer to this file until is it is closed (i.e. the 7th opened file, more or less)
[11:22:52] <hexnewbie> fdan: 0,1,2 are special, they are the standard input, output and error for the program
[11:23:30] <fdan> curdlesnoot https://dpaste.org/tAdV
[11:23:53] <fdan> hexnewbie sure
[11:24:34] <curdlesnoot> fdan: so, let's consider what happened. firstly, the > symbol instructed the shell to open log.file for writing n file descriptor 1. afterwards, the shell ran ls as a sub-process (which inherited the file descriptor state).

[11:24:46] *** Joins: penguino (~mrpenguin@user/mrpenguin)
[11:26:00] <curdlesnoot> fdan: ls printed the directory entries to stdout - thus to log.file at this point. after ls terminated, fd 1 was restored to is original state, referring back to /dev/pts/1 again. finally, cat log.file was run, printing the file to fd 1 - your terminal at this point.
[11:26:00] <fdan> curdlesnoot yes and?
[11:26:19] <curdlesnoot> you can see in the contents how fd 1 was referring to something else at the time ls ran.

[11:31:07] <fdan> curdlesnoot ok i think i got about the fd 1, what about fd2, they are also the same thing
[11:32:26] *** Quits: Pseudocrat (~sudo@user/pseudocrat) (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
[11:32:27] <curdlesnoot> fdan: they're different, obviously. it's just that, by default, in a terminal emulator, both streams are being written to the same place. run "ls ~", and it's printing to fd 1. run "ls /nonexistent" and it's going to print an error message to fd 2. you see both in your terminal regardless because both are pointing to /dev/pts/*.
[11:32:55] <curdlesnoot> you are free to independently direct either of those streams to distinct files though.

[11:35:53] <fdan> pts abbreviates to pseudo terminal?
[11:36:07] <fdan> is tty and pts are the same things?
[11:36:10] <curdlesnoot> fdan: yes. here's something fun to try. open two windows/tabs in your terminal emulator. run "tty" in one to see which is the associated pts device.

[11:41:30] <dconklin> That's awesome, TIL
[11:41:35] <curdlesnoot> the existence of this device is exactly what allows you to use your shell. when you type keystrokes, bash is reading from this device.

[11:41:55] <curdlesnoot> well, from fd 0 - it doesn't care that they are coming from a tty particularly but they are.
[11:42:18] <curdlesnoot> and when programs you run in the shell print things, it's because they are writing to this device, which the terminal emulator ultimately responds to.
[11:42:26] <hexnewbie> dconklin: That's what programs to do write in their terminal for them, anyway. (Except it's usually already open, though some open /dev/tty for good measure)
[11:43:16] <curdlesnoot> the terminal emulator takes responsibility for ensuring that the three standard fd's are associated with itself initially, and before your shell loads.

[12:49:48] <DLange> drivux: it is always "running" as it is built into the kernel. Whether it has something to do, depends on whether you have the hardware it services.

[16:33:32] <Psi-Jack> Yep. Gentoo's actually larger than most distros, because of the portage tree being required.

[16:35:28] <Psi-Jack> When I was doing Gentoo, though, I was using the binary packager in it because I /always/ have multiple systems using Linux. I literally had a build cluster of servers.
[16:35:36] <UNIXCHAD_> why dont you just use LFS at this point?
[16:35:39] <akik> okamis: no
[16:35:45] <Psi-Jack> UNIXCHAD_: Because LFS is a book.

[16:36:37] <rascul> lfs is no substitute for gentoo

[16:41:31] <Psi-Jack> I'd call it more niche than value.
[16:42:00] <felco> I think it is, you gotta know lots of packages, how dependencies works, you gotta go into the kernel and select what you want to use

[20:13:23] <Dagmar> Guest5465: Then you should probably check that the environment this process is inheriting actually has the ulimit set to what you think it does.  Several distributions set it to 0 in their init scripts because core files can leak sensitive information
[20:13:27] <Guest5465> It's weird that core dumps work in other programs but not in the program I am interested in.
[20:13:32] <Dagmar> THis isn't something that just randomly doesn't happen
[20:13:53] <Dagmar> If it's not happening, it's because you have not checked the things mentioned in that post and ensured they are set correctly in your environment.

[23:55:34] <hodapp> desktop as file manager isn't really a "special case"; it is purposely a spatial metaphor that took hold pretty early on precisely because it's something people pick up very quickly

[23:55:37] <michaelrose> If you watch actual users use their  computers you will see they absolutely do this someone with 5 windows gets to the desktop by clicking 5 minimize or close buttons
[23:55:37] <Dagmar> Most of _my_ users actually just logout when they're done, or they close the thing when they're done with it, or they alt-tab frequently.  I *watch* them
[23:55:38] <FIlystyn> don't you get tired from those discussions?
[23:55:40] <hodapp> read the case studies on Win95's UI design if you wish
[23:55:46] <msiism> FIlystyn: "But … is just a window manager."
[23:55:52] <FIlystyn> no
[23:55:54] <FIlystyn> but...
[23:56:03] <FIlystyn> kde gnome
[23:56:07] <FIlystyn> it's the worst

[23:56:11] <Dagmar> Only seldom do they explicitly minimize things.
[23:56:19] <FIlystyn> those people want windows
[23:56:23] <quippy> FIlystyn, idk the popcorn is pretty good, it's definitely more entertaining than the tests I should be writing
[23:56:25] <Dagmar> Usually they've got 2-3 apps on their desktop running all day long
[23:56:28] <msiism> FIlystyn: What elase is FVWM than a window manager?
[23:56:34] <msiism> s/elase/else
[23:56:43] <Dagmar> ...but that doesn't excuse increasing the friction required to launch those things, for any reason.
[23:56:45] <michaelrose> Clicking on the little file manager icon pinned to your workspace bar which is always visible unless you have an app in full screen is always one step
[23:57:08] <FIlystyn> fvwm won't sabotage you - fine enough
[23:57:13] <Dagmar> michalrose: "one step".  Are they now magically _getting things done_?
[23:57:30] <michaelrose> if you don't know the show desktop shortcut which most users do not getting to the desktop is order of n precise mouse clicks to clear n windows from the field
[23:57:34] <FIlystyn> \gnome and kde are made to be antiuser friendly
[23:57:35] <Dagmar> Is their job to open a file manager and admire some icons for their aesthetic value?
[23:57:45] <quippy> I just don't understand why it matters. Some people like to have crap on their desktop as a last-used-cache for files they haven't organized yet. Why does that bend you out of shape michaelrose ? Let people do their thing
[23:57:46] <Psi-Jack> FIlystyn: That is simply antitruth!@

[23:58:16] <OneLegend> user friendliness is up to the user
[23:58:21] <FIlystyn> every nw user will get trolled immediatly by those de

[23:58:29] <Dagmar> quippy: "messy desk" people.  Being a person who keeps a clean desk it never fails to surprise me that they get stuff done. Heh
[23:58:36] <Psi-Jack> FIlystyn: You seem to be trolling #linux more than anything.
[23:58:38] <craigevil> kde is very user friendly
[23:58:39] <quippy> I'm a messy desk person lol
[23:58:56] <michaelrose> quippy: the existence of stupid workflows doesn't itself serve as justification for using stupid workflows
[23:58:58] <FIlystyn> I was here ages ago - I simply stated my opinion on de discussion
[23:58:58] <quippy> I just don't organize files (because search exists) so I don't want to look at them in a GUI ever
[23:59:10] <FIlystyn> I can't udnerstand why gnome and kde are the top.
[23:59:11] <Dagmar> My stuff is at least grouped into folders by related work, or I'd just have a sprawling mess
[23:59:12] <Psi-Jack> FIlystyn: Your opinion is elitist, and inaccurate.
[23:59:15] <quippy> like, michaelrose, you're clearly a power user, why are you using a GUI at all?
[23:59:16] <OneLegend> I find GNOME and KDE to be user friendly, and maybe someone else doesn't
[23:59:19] <FIlystyn> I man xface is light years after them
[23:59:21] <OneLegend> it's a matter of opinion
[23:59:23] <FIlystyn> and it's not even good
[23:59:28] <quippy> obviously you should be arguing that only morons use a GUI michaelrose . The CLI is way more efficient and powerful
[23:59:35] <quippy> like seriously, you open Nautilus??
[23:59:39] <Psi-Jack> FIlystyn: Kindly stop.
