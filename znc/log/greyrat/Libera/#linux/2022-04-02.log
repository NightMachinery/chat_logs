[07:05:25] <stevecam> thad_the_man, so you open an application, libreoffice, chrome, kde, etc.... those are clients, the server is like the display

[07:05:40] <thad_the_man> stevecam, phogg: What's the service offered in the process?
[07:05:57] <phogg> People often have trouble with X client/server because it seems like the server should be remote and the clients local, but often the server is local and sometimes the clients are remote.
[07:06:04] <phogg> thad_the_man: in which process?
[07:06:09] <stevecam> thad_the_man, the service is the display

[07:06:57] <stevecam> thad_the_man, its not unusual to find the concept...... unusual
[07:07:06] <phogg> thad_the_man: the X server provides the display as a service; it therefore runs on the hardware that has a screen physically attached. X clients are applications that connect to the server and request that it display them on the screen.
[07:07:47] <rbox> phogg: are you a service
[07:07:47] <stevecam> thad_the_man, but what are you trying to achieve exactly, it might help having some example given to you
[07:07:59] <thad_the_man> phogg: That's what I just said. The old terminals which connected to a Unix machine and displayed the graphics and had the kkeybords, mivce are the clients.
[07:08:31] <phogg> thad_the_man: I don't know "mivce", but I am also not clear on what you are saying. The old Unix terminals did not involve X.

[07:11:39] <thad_the_man> phogg: yeah they did. Not the preX terminals ( eg vt100), but once you had X you could walk in to a terminal room sit down at a terminal. You would get a graphical login screen then login and get whatever window manger. Those were the clients.

[07:13:47] <thad_the_man> Bpmedley: No windows manager.
[07:13:51] <phogg> thad_the_man: Such devices may have existed in some form, but I cannot comment on how they worked. In order to have graphics displayed on a screen you need an X server running *locally*. EIther those "terminals" were physically wired to a local host Unix system or they had some novel architecture.

[07:14:40] <stevecam> thad_the_man, what would occur is you would login to another computer (over ssh for example), you might use a command like "ssh -X username@192.168.1.2" and what ssh would do is ensure the server could connect to your X server

[07:57:28] <Kadigan> I have a PC in my network, and it has multiple additional networks attached. It serves as my service/local bench sort of thing, where I can hook PCs up and they get their own IPs, can access the internet and so on.
[07:57:55] <Kadigan> I already have one instance of dnsmasq running on my router, and it provides name resolution for both external addresses, and internal "lan" domain.
[07:58:13] <Kadigan> Problem is, it doesn't know crap about hostnames assigned by this other PC.
[07:58:50] <Kadigan> So what I'm trying to do is to assign a new domain there ("ark"), so that it'll assign hosts with names like something.ark
[07:59:00] <Kadigan> (stop me if you see something truly idiotic, please)
[07:59:41] <Kadigan> As to how I'd like to then resolve them from the LAN - I told my primary dnsmasq (on the router) "server=/ark/10.0.1.22" so that it'll query names with .ark to that server.
[07:59:53] <Kadigan> So far so... good? This bit should be working.

[09:00:41] <Cold_Cat> it kind of is
[09:00:48] <blackop> almost dead :p
[09:01:09] <blackop> discord is the new IRC
[09:01:50] <Cold_Cat> and besides, with lots of people loosing trust in social media platforms I may need an xmpp server to chat with some of the people I know
[09:02:23] <TeaBoi> matrix is where the cool kids are now
[09:02:35] <Cold_Cat> matrix is bloat
[09:02:56] <TeaBoi> so that's why you're using IRC

[09:12:14] <wyclif> Part of the reason why there are things like Discord and Slack and they're now more popular than IRC is because nobody wants to build on an open protocol they can't own and monetize
[09:12:28] <wyclif> Depressing to think about, but true
[09:12:34] <Cold_Cat> I mean, I tried social media once and found it completely trash compared to this
[09:12:34] <Cold_Cat> yeah
[09:12:52] <Cold_Cat> but it's the open protocals that last the longest
[09:14:15] <wyclif> It's the same reason why Twitter is the way it is today instead of 2006. At one point early on, they could have chosen to be a protocol instead of an app. But where would the money be in that? Mastodon is closer to the right idea, but still far from perfect

One was that while the source was in 10.0.0 pool, the request was being shown as originating from the VPN location instead (which is on a different iface, not listed on interfaces=). On another machine, I never added the IP of the source to iptables, so it was being silently ignored. And so on...

[11:10:06] <Kadigan> jb1277976: if the partition is NTFS, the driver to *write* NTFS may not be present in the image you're using (if it hasn't changed, Linux can't write to NTFS natively?)

[11:10:53] <Kadigan> As for the check - it's possible that the OS set the "dirty" bit when it touched the partition - it's the flag that tells Windows "Uhh, we need to check this disk" if it's the system disk.
[11:10:56] <noobaroo> It didn't used to be. I'm not sure what point they started adding it, I think it was around 2016

[11:43:56] <wyclif> It's just the design is very, very 1998
[11:44:00] <lockywolf> purpux, you can replace `docker start` with an arbitrary command that is not designed to be "systemd-compliant"
[11:44:01] <gnoo> which is a problem but worry not since you can build systemd with curl and then read remote logs. isn't it great?!
[11:44:07] <wyclif> Not a problem IMO
[11:44:09] <noobaroo> The reason I dislike openrc is because its philosophy was designed as being a wrapper around sysvinit and sysv compatible
[11:44:21] <Kadigan> gnoo: are there any things that it logs that *aren't* available in plain files somewhere? It was my understanding that it just collates the contents according to some rules, but I don't really know. I'm curious now.
[11:44:35] <purpux> gnoo: I'm pretty sure you can use additional loggers to read from the journal in systemd as well

[11:47:30] <lockywolf> Kadigan, Windows is extremely hard
[11:47:42] <pnbeast> Kadigan, no.
[11:48:02] <lockywolf> Windows has excellent hardware support, but that is where its benefits end.
[11:48:04] <purpux> lockywolf: Just looked it up, and you enable the docker service with `systemctl enable docker` and you start it with `systemctl start docker`. Is that the complexity you were talking about ??

[11:48:48] <lockywolf> utoneq, where?
[11:48:54] <Kadigan> I don't know, man. Perhaps I have too many misconceptions, but I've always seen Linux as something that is difficult to use and master, but well worth the time spent (with Windows being easy to deploy and use, but difficult to lock down). Maybe times have changed.

[11:50:41] <lockywolf> What _is_ a "unit type"?
[11:50:52] <utoneq> so openrc is more lightweight
[11:51:03] <pnbeast> Kadigan, I think that's usually a simple matter of "familiarity", more completely "I grew up using Windows and everything in Linux is different so it's hard".  I believe that mainly because I was learning UNIX moreso than Windows, and Linux still seems easier.

[11:51:35] <utoneq> lockywolf: was it not unit type. i mean.. socket, timer, device, service, ketchup, mayonaise, etc etc
[11:51:36] <gnoo> of course it is binary: https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/journal-files/
[11:51:44] <Sauvin> Dunno about that. Linux took a bit more configuring, but even when I knew very little, it was a LOT easier getting stuff done in Linux.
[11:51:50] <lockywolf> binary is not that bad
[11:51:57] <lockywolf> after all, everything  is binary
[11:52:20] <gnoo> sure -- but that's not the unix^TM way
[11:52:40] <lockywolf> grep 'entry' ./stuff is not much better than foo_reader | grep 'entry'
[11:52:45] <Kadigan> pnbeast: that may very well be it, in the end. I'm predominantly a Windows guy. I use Linux for different tasks and to learn different approaches, so I'm not even remotely as well-versed in it.
[11:52:45] <purpux> lockywolf: You create a service file for the docker container... ok ? I fail to see the complexity. I think you would need to write your own init script in openrc as well
[11:52:50] <lockywolf> it's unixwayish enough
[11:53:11] <pnbeast> Exactly.  From my point of view, everything in Windows is a mystery, and the developer's own docs are frequently missing or even inaccurate.  With Linux, documentation is (believe it or not...) more complete and more accurate.
[11:53:16] <lockywolf> purpux, in whatever bash-based init I can type exactly the same command as in the console, and it just works

[11:53:52] <lockywolf> in systemd I have to two days trying to find out why systemd is killing the service after ~15 seconds of running
[11:54:04] <Kadigan> pnbeast: I think the universal constant is that documentation is complete and accurate, unless it pertains to whatever you're trying to coax into working *right now*.
[11:54:08] <lockywolf> gnoo, just use ssh to pipe
[11:54:19] <lockywolf> to pipe journalctl output to that machine
[11:54:54] <purpux> lockywolf: Is that the only argument you have for systemd's complexity ?? A file you have to write once and then copy ?
[11:55:01] <utoneq> so openrc. u like?
[11:55:01] <utoneq> i think unix and linux both suffer most from sabotage

I have a chat server running there for me and my friends, and it was taken down for "a high influx of NTP traffic". That's all support said. Do you guys know what they mean by that and how to stop it? Obviously the server runs linux (nixos).
[21:13:55] <rascul> you'll have to contact your isp but they probably just null routed it until the ddos stops

[21:17:20] <tomreyn> your provider will want you to wait it out, or, better, state "i've moved the targeted service to a different provider and updated all the hostnames pointing to this service, too". but don't state this unless you actually did, or you'll get in real trouble.

[21:24:32] <tomreyn> usually ntp traffic amplification attacks will abuse one or more insecurely configured ntp servers *elsewhere* and have them send reponse traffic to your server, thus overlaoding your bandwith. at least that's the 'classic' ntp aplification attack, while there are variants.
