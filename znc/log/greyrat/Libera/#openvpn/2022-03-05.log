[17:11:58] <_cslcm_> hey - with duplicate-cn, is there a way to limit the number of simultaneous connections from the same cn?
[17:12:21] <_cslcm_> i want to allow people to use multiple devices but i want to prevent runaway usage
[17:13:32] <BtbN> not that I'm aware
[17:14:04] <BtbN> You could script such functionality yourself I guess
[17:14:30] <BtbN> i.e. write a client-connect script that keeps track
[17:14:37] <_cslcm_> ok.
[17:15:01] <_cslcm_> Also i'm curious about the topic.. "TAP/bridging is almost always a bad idea" why?
[17:15:21] <BtbN> Wastes performance, is very insecure, has practically no benefits.
[17:16:43] <BtbN> !tuntap
[17:16:45] <BtbN> !tunottap
[17:16:47] <BtbN> !tunortap
[17:16:54] <BtbN> Did the bot never make it out of Freenode?
[17:16:54] <_cslcm_> "very insecure" - but not externally, right? it's only insecure if you don't trust the clients?
[17:17:16] <BtbN> A layer2 client can run ARP attacks on the whole network.
[17:17:20] <BtbN> Pointless risk
[17:19:17] <_cslcm_> and it wastes performance because it routes at a lower layer so includes extra overhead?
[17:20:45] <BtbN> It also disabled OpenVPN from doing a lot of its typical optimizations, which rely on the IP layer
[17:20:59] <_cslcm_> gotcha
[17:21:01] <_cslcm_> thanks for the info <3
[17:23:48] <_cslcm_> Another question - i'm having to use TCP mode because my mobile broadband changes IP address frequently (like, multiple times a minute) and this seems to confuse openvpn with udp (with tcp the IP address remains static while the connection remains open), is this expected or is there some configuration option to deal with this?
[17:34:29] <rob0> no
[17:34:41] <rob0> that is not a reason to "have to use TCP"
[17:35:54] <rob0> we're not seeing what you are seeing.  I do suspect you misinterpreted something.
[17:36:36] <BtbN> UDP is generally a lot more resilient to what you describe as "have to use TCP"
[17:36:45] <BtbN> TCP will just break if the local IP changes
[17:36:50] <rob0> so in your logs you see connections cut off and changing multiple times a minute?

[17:37:35] <rob0> BtbN: the bot lives, I think, but the factoid database was broken in an upgrade.
[17:38:16] <rob0> and I said I would fix it, but asked for the old db from ecrist_ ... never got it
[17:42:11] <rob0> _cslcm_: sounds like time to consider a new cell proovider.  That sounds awful.
