[10:53:07] <obby> how is everyone
[10:53:29] <obby> ive been setting up arch linux on my asus vivobook and i am running into some errors with gpg it just absolutely refuses to import keys

[10:54:23] <phrik> What do you mean it doesn't work? If there's an error, *tell us*. If it's more than two lines, see !paste.
[10:54:29] <obby> to be more specific when i install certain packages with yay it will sometimes need to import / recv keys

[12:11:42] <grawity> yeah because gpg needs to look up SRV records, not just basic hostnames
[12:12:25] <grawity> that functionality isn't part of nsswitch-based lookups (it's DNS-specific anyway) so using resolv.conf is fairly typical

[12:52:21] <Ennea> hey there. i've been running debian on my servers for ages now, and i'm always dreading any upgrades. so i just randomly had the thought of switching to a rolling release distro. and arch being the only one i know (which some friends of mine also use on desktop), i thought i'd hop in here and ask: what are your thoughts on running arch on a server? is there perhaps even some overview of things i should consider? coming from debian, i guess i should make sure 
[12:52:21] <Ennea> to familiarize myself with pacman

[12:55:51] <grawity> e.g. if you have Samba running and it gets upgraded, with the old version still running – it'll mysteriously break a few connections later
[12:56:08] <mitch0> so, depending on the type of server, arch is probably not the best option
[12:56:08] <grawity> if you have Apache running and it gets upgraded without restart – it'll mysteriously crash whenever certbot tries to reload config

[12:56:18] <NetSysFire> also be prepared that updates potentially break stuff since you dont get "stable" versions
[12:56:35] <NetSysFire> but yeah, it might not be the best option
[12:56:41] <mitch0> (unless you have proper HA setup where a rolling restart doesn't cause outage)
[12:56:41] <grawity> if you have cron running and PAM gets upgraded – cron jobs will start failing (this specifically *did* get a pacman hook to auto-restart crond)
[12:57:17] <grawity> it's not really a big difference, it's just that Debian does all the restarts automatically during package upgrade (sometimes with a long gap between stop and start)
[12:57:33] <Ennea> can i automate this on arch somehow?
[12:57:51] <Ennea> as for frequent updates, would weekly be frequent enough?

[14:53:33] <lostchild> well, I am trying to configure Routing Tables and mark traffic. And the 'ip' command requires me to enter a 'uidrange' that will force specific users to use specific RTs
[14:53:39] <Namarrgon> "man 5 passwd"

[14:53:41] *** Quits: gehidore (~username@user/man) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[14:54:09] <another|> that's the gid, not a range
[14:54:18] <lostchild> grawity: I am in complete uncertainty, cannot answer this question :)
[14:54:21] <grawity> lostchild: per passwd(5) the 4th field is the primary _group_ ID that the user belongs to – which starts off at 1000 like UIDs, but if you've ever manually created new groups (e.g. ever did a `groupadd friends`), then the next free GID will no longer be the same as the next free UID
[14:54:29] <grawity> in short, not a range
[14:54:33] <another|> as for ip: `uidrange 1002-1002`
[14:56:03] <lostchild> another|: 1002-1002 will force a specific uid(user) to use a specific RT?

[16:23:38] <misterturnip> hey, I am unable to boot after typing in my password to decrypt the hard drive.  I'm trying to debug this, but the core issue is that I don't know where it is failing.  Is there a way to turn on the boot progress messages by pressing a hotkey or something?
[16:24:34] <Fr0stBit> Ok just added amdgpu to mkinitcpio.conf modules, and early kms seems to solve the above problem

I did everything as described in this guide(https://osric.com/chris/accidental-developer/2019/03/linux-policy-based-routing/) to configure a few interfaces that I have. Furthermore I added this rule 'ip rule add uidrange 1002-1002 lookup 1002', so that the user(1002) looks up for 1002 Rtable. But anyway all traffic for user(1002) goes for some reason not to 2nd interface, but through the 1st, which is 
[16:28:18] <lostchild> set up for user(1001). What is the thing that is missing here? Can't get around that...

[16:38:05] <grawity> pankaj: on Linux, if you are root, then you can use the TIOCSTI ioctl to fake input to a tty – using the 'writevt' tool https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grawity/code/master/thirdparty/writevt.c

[16:38:43] <grawity> pankaj: in many cases, you're better off using a tool that *creates* a tty and directly controls its "master" end, where the input is normally provided
[16:38:46] <Fr0stBit> another|: Ryzen 7 5800H with integrated AMD Vega 8 Graphics 
[16:38:55] <grawity> pankaj: e.g. you could start a tmux, and use `tmux send-key` to ask it to send input to any of its windows
[16:39:15] <grawity> pankaj: Screen and some other terminal emulators may also have "send key to tty" commands
[16:39:22] <ville> if anyone has nothing better to do then report a bug against the "freecad" pacakge. freecad's internal macro manager uses "python-gitpython" for some of its functionality, but "python-gitpython" is not a required or optional dependency

[22:20:15] <SysGhost> the problem is that when the mime check on the file is done, it sees video/<format-type> and trhus any video/allformats and variants are ignored.
