[10:06:38] <dafna2[m]> hi, I see that after I save a message by pressing 's' it is then flagged with 'D' and also when navigating the index it jumps above this message. Can someone explain why is that and how to change it.

[12:45:08] <Demosthenex> ok, so huge maildir of years of mail. mutt and mairix are a great success. heard that the fdm dev exports old mail to mbox files for archival. anyone have an opinion on using compressed mbox for arhival storage? maildir is clearly superior for recent items in progress.

[21:09:23] <kevin8t8> dafna2[m]: in Mutt, 's' (<save-message>) is essentially "move to mailbox".  It copies to the mailbox and marks as deleted in the current mailbox.
[21:10:06] <kevin8t8> dafna2[m]: use capital 'C' (<copy-mesage>) to copy without marking as deleted
[21:11:32] <kevin8t8> dafna2[m]: for navigation you can use capital 'J' and 'K' to move up/down without skipping over deleted messages.
[21:12:01] <dafna2[m]> oh, ok, thank you!
[21:13:00] <kevin8t8> dafna2[m]: see <http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/#menus> and scan through section 3, 4, and 5 for more details about some of these things.
[21:14:35] <kevin8t8> dafna2[m]: well, actually those "intro" sections don't really talk about the problem you were asking about, do they.  :-/
[21:16:20] <kevin8t8> dafna2[m]: <http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/#index-map> gives the details about the various keybindings, but I admit it's buried deep in the manual.
