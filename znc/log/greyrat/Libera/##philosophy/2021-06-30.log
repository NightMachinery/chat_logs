[00:00:02] <arryana> i've more or less finished this week's reading, though noticing that siddhartha and demian were a buck, those will have to go on the list too
[00:00:12] <lalia> I get a lot out of skepticism because I've never found a place to hang my philosophical hat, so to speak, and that's what the tradition is meant to deal with, at least for folks like me. :)

[00:01:38] <lalia> For people like me, skepticism represents a means for avoiding confusion and anxiety in the context of philosophical inquiry.
[00:02:05] <lalia> It's great to read people covering the history of the tradition more.
[00:02:42] * arryana nods
[00:02:58] <arryana> skepticism seems to me to be the safest place to stand
[00:03:03] <lalia> The area of skepticism payed most attention to in philosophy is the type contended with by folks like Descartes. The problem is it corresponds to no real life person. That is, nobody acts like the skeptic he outlines.
[00:03:08] <arryana> least of a back-to-the wall view of things
[00:03:10] <lalia> Not sincerely anyways.
[00:03:17] <arryana> since there's nothing to defend
[00:03:40] <lalia> Right, that's especially the idea for Pyrrhonists as well as the Indian traditions of skepticism.
[00:03:51] * arryana nods
[00:04:14] <lalia> Mills characterizes it as a skepticism about philosophy for people like me. :)
[00:04:17] <lalia> He'd be right.
[00:05:57] <lalia> He also refers to it as a form of therapy for folks like me... so it's meant to provide a means for relief. Also consistent with my experience.

[01:45:48] <spruit11> mwa,  I think plankers had a valid question but ah well
[01:46:12] <plankers> well thanks
[01:47:02] *** laguneucl is now known as chomwitt
[01:47:44] <raincomplex> yeah it's interesting
[01:47:52] <raincomplex> i think the core of it is a language problem
[01:48:22] <raincomplex> namely, that language makes it easy to think something is a paradox that actually isn't
[01:49:00] <raincomplex> "am i the same or different?" seems to imply that it must be one or the other
[01:49:11] * Beyondo wonders if there are any paradoxes that aren't the result of language
[01:49:21] <raincomplex> but there are senses in which you are the same, and senses in which you are different
[01:50:02] <raincomplex> Beyondo, i think perhaps there aren't any paradoxes which aren't the result of /thought/ :D
[01:50:30] <Beyondo> i agree, all paradoxes are the result of incorrect thinking
[01:51:30] <raincomplex> in the sense that thought is ultimately a reduction of the complexity of reality, and with such reduction comes loss of information (in the form of implicit perspective/context)
[01:54:21] <raincomplex> and the same applies to a temporary "i don't like doing X". there is implicit in the statement (and the context presented) the idea that preferences don't change, which is demonstrably false
[01:54:49] <raincomplex> in fact it's assumed in the example, that the person like doing X in the past
[01:54:53] <raincomplex> liked*
[01:56:31] <plankers> i was interested in the ontological question of whether our changes in desires and motivations are the result of literally being a different person
[01:56:52] *** Quits: lalia (lalia@user/lalia) (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[01:57:00] <plankers> like in a DID way but more subtle
[01:57:43] <raincomplex> i don't know if it makes sense to say 'result' but i think they're definitely related
[01:57:54] <raincomplex> desires and motivations and personality are all tied up together
[01:58:05] <plankers> sure
[01:58:34] <plankers> it was just a random thought
[01:59:43] <raincomplex> it's a good thought
[02:00:13] <plankers> :)
[02:00:47] <raincomplex> people have been trying to understand language and identity paradoxes since probably shortly after language showed up
[02:02:41] *** Quits: chomwitt (~Pitsikoko@2a02:587:dc0b:0:d8f7:cdfe:4658:bec4) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[02:02:47] <raincomplex> i think ideas come in different sizes. some take a lot more experience and work to understand
[02:03:03] <raincomplex> it seems like every idea should be expressible in a dictionary definition but that's definitely not the case
[02:03:25] <raincomplex> another trick of language
[02:04:00] <plankers> sure and plenty of languages have words for things others dont
[02:04:53] <raincomplex> yeah, the interaction of culture and language is big
[02:06:20] <econo> Maybe this is stating the obvious, but consistency is going to depend a lot on how you model the self. To give two extremes, we could say that the object born to your parents and referred to by your name is a self that persists until brain death. We could also say that the self is indexed by time and so at every moment you have a new self. Clearly these result in very different answers

[02:06:42] <raincomplex> even something that you might assume would translate simply, like "bread", to people from different cultures, in their experience means different types of bread, methods of baking, meals the bread goes with. these are the subtleties that don't end up in the dictionary

[02:09:12] <raincomplex> then there are other ones like the mystical perspective, where all humans become one 'self'

[02:19:53] <evolv> I wish I had spent more of my free time reading on semiotics
[02:20:09] <Parf> what about the senses i'm both different and the same simultaneously while still being "self"
[02:20:43] <evolv> a self has to be constant, defining
[02:20:51] <evolv> something that cannot change
[02:21:19] <evolv> "essence"
[02:21:47] <evolv> so we can think of something as having a conventional self, but those are momentary entangled processes

[07:36:48] <amigojapan> Hi evolv
[07:36:57] <evolv> hi, amigojapan!
[07:37:01] <evolv> how goes it
[07:37:10] <amigojapan> evolv: it's pretty ok
[07:37:38] <evolv> not entirely ok?
[07:37:39] <amigojapan> evolv: you know what hemoglobin A1C is?
[07:37:43] *** Quits: bosspotato (~bosspotat@user/bosspotato) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[07:37:58] <amigojapan> No. I mean it is going quite alright
[07:38:34] <evolv> I had to check, but I recalled that blood sugar tests are used
[07:39:32] <evolv> might be diabetic?
[07:39:35] <amigojapan> evolv: it is a long term test of blood sugar, more reliable than just blood sugar
[07:40:27] <evolv> my friend lost a lot of weight after he found out he's diabetic
[07:40:37] <amigojapan> evolv: tomako took such a test recently and the doctor took her off insulin all together, after 4 months of keto diet
[07:40:46] <evolv> yep, he did keto, too
[07:41:31] <amigojapan> It seems keto is very effective against diabetes
[07:41:47] <evolv> it's not manageable long-term
[07:41:57] <evolv> but you're shunting a pathway into ketosis
[07:42:44] <evolv> and that's really easy to measure while you're on the keto diet
[07:42:54] <amigojapan> evolv: I just think carbs and sugars are mainly what causes diabetes

[07:43:21] <evolv> yeah, type II is mostly diet-dependent
[07:43:59] <amigojapan> Right, tomako is type II
[07:45:15] <evolv> staying within ideal to a bit over overweight threshold tends to prevent a lot of health issues - especially with age
[07:45:50] <evolv> while still horrible, if you're within healthy body weight, you could eat almost primary sugar
[07:46:22] <amigojapan> evolv: I think when people say "diet dependent"they should should also mention that mostly carbs and sugars are the problem. But that everything else is ok
[07:46:44] <evolv> carbs has been the big bad for awhile
[07:46:52] <evolv> especially since Atkins got really big
[07:47:39] <amigojapan> Both tomako and I have been doing the diet together and I lost 12kg
[07:47:53] <evolv> nice, and good on you for being supportive by doing it with her
[07:48:12] <amigojapan> I needed to lose weight too
[07:48:48] <evolv> very good
[07:49:13] <evolv> there other little things here and there that can help lose weight in their sum contributions and boost cardiovascular
[07:49:18] <evolv> like 10 minute ice cold showers
[07:49:37] <amigojapan> Ah
[07:49:42] <evolv> walking around while talking on the phone
[07:49:48] <evolv> using standing desks (blah)
[07:50:01] <evolv> even fidgeting
[07:50:45] <amigojapan> evolv: Linus torvalds uses a desk which he adapted a treadmill to
[07:51:04] <evolv> that's just hard to do
[07:51:30] <amigojapan> He is always walking
[07:51:37] <evolv> but he's linus torvalds
[07:51:47] <amigojapan> Lol true
[07:51:53] <evolv> walking does help with thinking, but c'mon
[07:52:03] <evolv> while on the computer? no way I can do that
[07:52:14] <amigojapan> I see
[07:52:58] <evolv> sugary drinks are some of the worst offenders with weight
[07:53:13] <evolv> liquids are less filling than solids, so more sugar consumed
[07:53:15] <amigojapan> evolv: most of the walking I do involves going to the supermarket. It is like 15 minutes away
[07:53:58] <amigojapan> evolv: the only sugar we have nowadays is in fruit
[07:54:38] <evolv> Japan is so rice heavy, isn't it?
[07:57:02] <amigojapan> Yes evolv
[07:57:36] <evolv> that makes things tough

[08:09:29] <pussipupu> There's talk of 4-day-work weeks a lot of places currently, it's an interesting idea as long as it doesn't leave people underresourced
[08:11:21] <evolv> amigojapan, that depends on what type of diabetes. It's not carbs alone, but mainly weight
[08:12:26] <evolv> if you're in the healthy weight range, carbs don't matter
[08:13:21] <evolv> you're just not eating enough carbs to even cause the weight gain to begin with, even if you're eating more than the average person
[08:13:28] <amigojapan> I see evolv
[08:13:38] <evolv> offsetting the carbs are likely more activity (which is hard)
[08:13:44] <evolv> but think athletes
[08:14:44] <evolv> a can of Pepsi requires something like 2.5 miles of walking (roughly) for net zero Calories gained

[09:36:20] <Panther> I almost never gambled when I was there, but one time when I did I won $2000.
[09:36:44] <evolv> amigojapan, you go with the intent of losing X cash in your wallet
[09:36:59] <amigojapan> I see evolv
[09:37:00] <evolv> my friend paid my entire way, so I had about 100ish in my wallet or something at the time, I don't remember
[09:37:08] <Panther> Or think of it as spending on entertainment.
[09:37:15] <evolv> I played the machines out of boredom because he was playing the machines. I lost it all
[09:37:23] <evolv> but it was a net gain
[09:37:26] <Panther> Assuming you find being in the casino entertaining.
[09:37:49] <evolv> which it isn't
[09:37:50] <Panther> They drive me nuts after a while.
[09:37:57] <evolv> they're nothing like the movies
[09:38:08] <evolv> less glamorous, much smaller
[09:38:12] <Panther> Tho, free drinks are nice.
[09:38:37] <evolv> I never got a free drink, but I never sat around playing long enough for some liquid encouragement to be offered
[09:38:49] <Panther> You can walk through the casino, pick up a drink or two, and go into the lounge for a show.
[09:39:02] <evolv> they just give you free drinks by asking?
[09:39:06] <Panther> Sue
[09:39:08] <Panther> Sure
[09:39:17] <evolv> I thought servers just come around and give you drinks
[09:39:20] <Panther> It is customary to tip the waitress, tho.
[09:39:25] <evolv> only if you looked like you were gambling
[09:39:46] * Panther shrugs
[09:40:06] <Panther> You can put a few coins into a machine and put it down to the cost of the drinks, and maybe you might win.
[09:40:22] <evolv> my friend got drunk, which he has done only a couple times in his life, which was supposed to be fun
[09:40:34] <evolv> but he decided to play hide and seek in vegas without my knowledge
[09:40:53] <Panther> I don't like how they let ppl walk out of the casinos with the drinks in plastic cups, cuz they throw them all over the place.
[09:41:03] <evolv> that's the vegas experience
[09:41:13] <evolv> hell in a heaven wrapper
[09:41:46] <Panther> I had a nice time, tho.
[09:41:53] <evolv> vegas was so disappointing, I forgot I went there until just now
[09:41:59] <Panther> This was a while ago, tho.. 1995.

[09:42:39] <evolv> how'd it go?
[09:42:54] <Panther> I had a decent time, but I didn't want to stay there.
[09:43:17] <evolv> it's like you wanted what happened in vegas to stay in
[09:43:25] <Panther> Her dad was COO of a company that owned the 4 Queens casino.
[09:43:46] <evolv> did it get beat out by the 4 Aces?
[09:43:55] <evolv> badom ss
[09:43:57] <Panther> She was very pretty, and nice, but she was also crazy.
[09:44:39] <evolv> that describes me
[09:45:06] <evolv> well, ok, I could be nicer
[09:45:23] <Panther> In that there was a serious disjunction between the map of reality she has in her head, and the maps that most of us carry.
[09:45:52] <evolv> hmm, I have the map most people carry, but mine has a lot more dead ends
[09:45:58] <evolv> and toll roads
[09:46:32] <Panther> It was ok, and even fun up to a point, but it truly obfuscated luculent parlance. :)
[09:47:07] <evolv> I do not know the word luculent
[09:47:10] <Panther> Do you have to have exact change for the toll?
[09:47:27] <evolv> yes, no easy pass type of deal, neither
[09:47:35] <evolv> no carpool lanes
[09:47:41] <evolv> mostly dirt roads, too

[14:32:41] <pussipupu> and yes lions are scarce, don't use lions as currency

[14:34:37] <arryana> in fact, i think it's mandatory
[14:41:05] <DPA> Lions can self-reproduce and are renewable. If people used them as currency, they would probably start trying to produce more of them immediately.
[14:42:14] <Crassus> pussipupu: We should abolish currency I think. It's bad.
[14:42:57] <pussipupu> OK, you're welcome to think that
[14:43:14] <Crassus> pussipupu: Well, we could just use entries in bank databases as currency.
[14:43:16] <pussipupu> I don't agree, at least in the absence of alternative systems of organisation
[14:43:38] <pussipupu> I don't know what you think "currency" means
[14:43:56] <Crassus> pussipupu: Well, usually physical notes and coins.
[14:44:16] <pussipupu> ok, that's not what the word generally means
[14:44:26] <pussipupu> you might be thinking of "cash"
[14:46:34] <Crassus> pussipupu: Umm... yeah, currencies often refer to the US dollar, Canadian dollar etc. I suppose. In economics, it usually refer to "cash" (M0). There's also M1, M2 and M3.
[14:47:46] <DPA> A sustainable decentralized trust / knowledge based currency system was demonstrated ages ago: rai stones
[14:48:26] <DPA> People just need to know which stones are whoms.

[14:49:51] <DPA> I hadn't thought about that...
[14:51:27] <pussipupu> I just meant in general use, "currency" and "cash" aren't synonyms
[14:51:38] <arryana> ^
[14:52:08] <arryana> going cashless seems like an enormous and unfounded trust in a system.

[14:59:24] <DPA> In a system where everything is money, can people without access to it exist in the eyes of the system?
[14:59:26] <arryana> i know!  everyone can be tattooed with an id which is linked to their jobs and bank accounts.  there's no -way- that can go wrong!
[15:02:09] <DPA> (Looks like they can, so that's what debts are for?)
[15:02:38] <Crassus> pussipupu: Lets give them access to the ICT first then, eh?
[15:03:27] <Crassus> pussipupu: Because it helps tax evasion, creates risks to employees because stealing it is simple, takes up business time on activities like cash handling, banking and money counting and is easy to steal.
[15:06:36] <arryana> hahaha.  right.  because the amounts of cash stolen are so much larger than the digital thefts.
[15:07:01] <pussipupu> Giving everyone access to the means of computing and communication I'm certainly in favour of
[15:07:37] <pussipupu> I'm sceptical of just getting rid of cash even then though, short of a general provision of the necessities of life to all
[15:08:00] <arryana> ^
[15:16:44] <DPA> There is a problem with economies. Once the means exist to create enough for everyone without everyone needing to do something, there are people which can't get a job and earn money, so they can't buy the stuff,
[15:16:44] <DPA> and the ones who have work still usually wont gain enough money to get everything they want, they'll usually at most be able to get what they need.
[15:16:44] <DPA> This is the point where the system, instead of optimizing for everyone to get more and better stuff, starts to optimize for maximizing everyone worktime, so everyone can keep buying the stuff they produce, and just about that much.
[15:20:27] <pussipupu> Maximising working hours isn't even good for productivity

[15:22:40] <pussipupu> I'd be open to pretty radical changes to economies personally, but we need the data and the rhetoric
[15:23:17] <DPA> Yes, it the be bad for business if too much is produced, people couldn't buy everything, prices would fall, and businesses would earn less.
[15:26:37] <DPA> And then there is that counter-intuitive debt thing. If the amount of money in a system is fixed, and people can't overspend, then some people will save money, which then will no longer be in circulation.
[15:26:37] <DPA> So prices would increase as people buy less, and people would try to save more. The system would stagnate. Debt solves this. By companies and people spending money they don't have, money will always flow, and stuff keeps selling.

[15:48:23] <DPA> The system currently also doesn't work quiet as intended. In capitalism, maximizing making money is a proxy for well being, intended to work by maximizing the amount and/or quality of goods so people can have more and/or better stuff.
[15:48:23] <DPA> But like with any genetic algorithm, if easier means to maximise the reward function are found, they are used. That's what anititrust laws are for, prevent monopolies and such. But those laws haven't been sufficiently
[15:48:23] <DPA> updated to deal with todays technology. Planned obsolescence, unrepairable devices, DRM, virtual restrictions of what one can do with his own stuff, mean more gain for worse products, and almost nobody catches on.
[15:55:22] <pussipupu> I'm sceptical of the base claim
[15:55:30] <pussipupu> "intended" by whom?
[16:05:09] <DPA> I'm not sure, but I thought that was wat it was for. The goal of any system should be to improve everyone life. There must be a means to do that. I thought for capitalism, that is the concept of supply and demand.
[16:05:09] <DPA> And I though the idea with supply and demand is so everyone can have the best and/or most of anything needed?

[16:14:39] <kmh> DPA, yes but reward function is already faulty
[16:14:52] <kmh> meaning you often optimize for shit
[16:15:19] <kmh> you get a garbage in and garbage out for the maximizing process
[16:16:08] <kmh> since money is often a rather shitty (short term) proxy for externalisation effects alone
[16:16:54] <kmh> pussipupu,  i'd separate capitalism from free markets somewhat
[16:17:12] <DPA> pussipupu: Of course those who benefit the most from a system wouldn't want to change it. But I think it's important to nonetheless ascribe a purpose to it beyond that, or there won't be a reason to ever change it.
[16:17:30] <pussipupu> We don't even bother to deexternalise for things like the known costs of pollution and similar
[16:17:52] <kmh> pussipupu,  yes
[16:17:55] <pussipupu> I would want a definition of both of those terms "capitalism" and "free markets"
[16:18:11] <pussipupu> They don't have uncontested meanings
