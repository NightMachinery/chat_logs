[01:35:26] <rwb> hi there, i'm having a little bit of trouble. i'm using doom emacs and lsp-ui. i have my font set to Fira Code with 100 spacing. however for some reason lsp-ui's code actions are rendered with 110 spacing, causing the code actions to flow off the side of emacs. i looked through lsp-ui's code and the code that renders the code actions seems to be here:
[01:35:28] <rwb> https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-ui/blob/master/lsp-ui-sideline.el#L520 can anyone spot anything obvious that i'm missing here? i though that maybe concat is stripping text properties or something like that, but idk too much elisp so i'm kinda stuck.

[02:44:47] <rwb> i *think* i might have discovered an emacs bug. when i add the "height" display property to a text, it ignores the original spacing rules i had and displays the string with incorrect spacing. here's how it looks (strings placed on the top left in an overlay): https://i.imgur.com/1Ho3TOe.png the second "Hello world" has the wrong spacing.
[02:45:21] <rwb> (lsp-ui-sideline--compute-height) returns '(height 1)
[02:47:22] <TRS-80> I would guess probably not, but take it to the mailing list (or emacs-report-bug I think is the command)

[07:21:10] <twb> dale: yes
[07:21:11] <dale> If so, I admit I'm having a bit of trouble imagining why it cares, other than that SQLAlchemy is not really geared up to handle weakly-typed DBs.
[07:21:23] <twb> dale: it's not weakly typed
[07:21:26] <twb> it's dynamically yped
[07:22:05] <twb> admittedly the type system is a bit crap, e.g. there is no datatype for ISO 8601 period.  But this is no worse than MySQL

[12:25:54] <bkhl> Yeah, I found an fdw thing that wraps DB2, but it's a Github page without a license and looks not terribly mature.
[12:26:08] <bkhl> I suspect I'll be better off writing a program that just connects to both databases.

[12:33:40] <bkhl> I mean there's probably nothing wrong with ODBC as such. It's just the DB2 driver for it is horrible.

[16:38:52] <mekeor> hi afidegnum :)
[16:39:21] <afidegnum> how do i add multiple packages inside use-package ?
[16:39:23] <susam> A quick update on the "Mastering Emacs" reading session. We did a book club reading session together about a week ago. But since I was sharing the book on desktop, I thought I should get Mickey's permission before sharing the book on desktop for viewers.

[16:42:52] <susam> Mikey Petersen has granted the permission, so I will resume with the "Mastering Emacs" book club meetings.
[16:43:21] <afidegnum> ok, thanks, 
[16:44:12] <susam> I have not worked out the mode of meetings but will stick to Twitch for the next few ones because it worked last time. So 14:00 UTC at https://twitch.tv/spcafe for those interested. Let us try it out. Channel #sp to discuss more on this topic if we want to avoid spamming this channel.

[20:45:19] <arch> Unicode's whole goal of being a universal text system that any language (Or lack of language) can use to communicate with each other is just really hecking cool imo

[20:45:40] <corwin> grym: doesn't that view make the concept of text as apart from language a bit less useful
[20:45:45] <susam> Everything can be called a text if we were entertain that thought. Even videos can be encoded as text. But we draw the line between text and more-than-text somewhere.
[20:45:59] <grym> susam: and for bleep-bloop machines, that's ~unicode

[20:48:22] <cvanduse`> The closest Merriam-Webster gets to text referring to representation is "the main body of printed or written matter on a page".
[20:48:22] <arch> technomancy: wrong paste, but good thread though
[20:48:41] <cvanduse`> So, "text" is probably the wrong word to be (re-)defining. 
[20:48:45] <grym> technomancy: tangentially but very cool/derp: it took me until well into my 20s to consider that perhaps there were other writing systems in ancient egypt that, say, a scribe could write at speed

[20:48:57] <susam> I don't have an airtight argument for my displeasure for emojis and I don't need an airtight argument. It's a feeling. Too many emoji faces in a README bothers me but too many Greek letters in a README does not if done for an appropriate reason.

[20:54:23] * technomancy realizes he forgot to uninstall emoji fonts on his new machine
[20:54:23] <arch> That's why having everything standardize is a good idea, since most people will likely only care about their local language
[20:54:38] <grym> technomancy: this might be up your alley: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYYraMgiBA&feature=emb_title 
[20:54:55] <arch> And if that isn't all one standard, we get encoding hell all over again when dealing with non-english
[20:55:13] <susam> Okay, I think I have an acceptable definition that works for me. If I can write it by hand with pen and paper, it is text. Can one write a snowman emoji with pen and paper? I think, not. One has to *draw* snowman with pen and paper, so snowman isn't text.
[20:55:15] <grym> technomancy: (he at one point amusingly derides ancient egyptians as johnny-come-latelys )
[20:55:33] <arch> Unicode has pretty much categorically eliminated one of the most terrifying data corruption problems, and I think that's amazing
[20:55:35] <grym> susam: kanji are out too, huh
[20:55:42] <arch> At least, for those things that use it
[20:55:44] <grym> you certainly draw those
[20:55:54] *** Quits: ferdy (~ferdy@80.210.102.194) (Quit: Leaving.)
[20:56:02] <technomancy> anyway I think "emoji are unicode therefore they're text" doesn't work as an argument because the unicode standard also includes control characters
[20:56:25] <arch> I think control characters are text too, just...ones with special meaning to machines rather than humans
[20:56:30] <susam> I knew it would now require us to take a close look at "write" vs. "draw". :-) I think Kanji is both drawing and writing, so still falls within text.

[20:58:34] <technomancy> according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_(Unicode) emoji is considered "not a script"
[20:58:39] <bpalmer> qorg: if you evaluate (getenv "SSH_AUTH_SOCK"), do you get the same value as you do in an xterm (or whatever terminal you use) ?
[20:59:18] <qorg> No, i get nil
