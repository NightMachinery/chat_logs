[05:35:11] <viva> DegCor totally unrelated but reading your comment makes me think about a very irksome issue i run into with software versioning... in your example is v5.16 > v5.4 ?
[05:35:25] <DegCor> Yes, as it's always been.
[05:35:51] <viva> so it went 5.5,5.6,5.7, etc.? all the way to 5.14

[05:40:34] <DegCor> By the way, the first part is often called the major number, incremented when major changes (up to the producer's definition) have been conducted, zero is then almost always used to indicate pre-release (or pre-release-quality) works, whereas the second number is called minor, for ordinary revisions.

So in looking this up, tiered storage is required, and Optane does that well.....

[13:07:00] <kevdersmrdi> Hi, so my use case is as following: data analysis of marketing campaigns in Tableau and SEO for a larger ecommerce company. I really liked linux back in the day (the openSUSE 13 series) and KDE. I was thinking of trying Linux for work again.
[13:07:00] <kevdersmrdi> BAsically, data viz software is the only real breaking point - does anyone here do data/business analysis on Grafana? Is it good?
[13:07:01] <kevdersmrdi> And in 2022, which distro is now
[13:07:01] <kevdersmrdi> - good for professionals
[13:07:02] <kevdersmrdi> - big an active troubleshooting community
[13:07:02] <kevdersmrdi> - overall 'does not break' stable?

[14:51:25] <labrador> quantum_, apt is trusted
[14:51:25] <MrElendig> number of files have no impact on security
[14:51:33] <labrador> If you are installing from the debian repos that is
[14:51:48] <MrElendig> there is no difference between installing 2000 files, and having the exact same data in one single file
[14:51:57] <MrElendig> from a security standpoint

[16:18:54] <alioui> hi all, i have a process that generate a lot of disk io to the point that i can't even run commands
[16:18:54] <alioui> is there a way to find which process and file responsible of this high io ?
[16:18:59] <jacekowski> so you can slowly extract limited amount of information by affecting plaintext and checking where

[16:19:19] <DLange> alioui: sudo iotop
[16:19:22] <jacekowski> if it is smaller then whatever you've added matches something that is already in there

[23:56:43] <DLange> that is different if you are a hoster to run 100,000 client Wordpress VMs
[23:56:47] <orangebot> DavidSaylor41040: Debian or Ubuntu is typically a nice one if you're new

[23:58:56] <kfrench> orangebot: Nothing shared.  I would create a base image and push it out to all of the hosts.  It was possible to pxe boot the image as well.
