[00:53:48] <Activ8> cos they make enough from their consoles

[00:55:42] <Rpifan> So now no real PC games 
[00:55:53] <Activ8> there will be loads just not with ms
[00:56:04] <Activ8> you seen the new hand held console by steam
[00:56:24] <Activ8> https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck
[00:57:17] <Rpifan> Yea 
[00:57:31] <Rpifan> I mean I don't mean graphics but game play will be affected for sure 
[00:57:32] <mistiry> i mean, flight sim is pretty new, and was a significant investment and effort for MS
[00:57:44] <Rpifan> You can't just make one single game that runs on everything equally well
[00:58:26] <mistiry> but they've always been more of the "system to play the game on" rather than publishing their own games
[00:58:47] <Rpifan> Is flight sim PC only? 
[00:59:06] <mistiry> it was at first
[00:59:09] <mistiry> its console now
[00:59:33] <mistiry> but i mean, "exclusives" in general are becoming less common, though certainly still a thing
[00:59:43] <Rpifan> Do you play with a gigantic whell
[01:00:02] <Activ8> the 512gb one is a big cost for a hand held
[01:00:26] <Activ8> that should be more than enough power to run top games and I assume steam will be testing a lot of the game line up
[01:00:47] <Rpifan> Maybe someone can redo empire earth 
[01:00:50] <voice06[m]> Activ8: the cost is offset in that you can attach a usb-c dock to it and use it as a standalone computer
[01:00:59] <Rpifan> But even if they did get the code it must be some crazy spaghetti shit
[01:01:20] <mistiry> yeah its a full-blown PC

[01:13:21] <Activ8> battery and panels
[01:13:31] <shibboleth> they're... inanimate objects?
[01:13:33] <PublicWiFi> what kind of maintenance did you have to do?
[01:13:47] <a1> shibboleth: so is a house, but it still needs maintenance =p

[01:15:02] <signofzeta> I haven't calculated it, but I haven't had to pay the power bill in five months.
[01:15:10] <Activ8> I got a cheque every month for unused electric
[01:15:16] <signofzeta> Yes, I do sell unused power to the grid.  It's a two-way meter, but the rates are good.
[01:15:17] <shibboleth> me? dunno. i'm not off grid, only meant for... "end of days" or whatever
[01:15:20] <Activ8> I was getting about 150/200 a month back 
[01:15:30] <Activ8> plus lower elec bills
[01:15:35] <signofzeta> Most months, I use less than I make.  The air conditioning is the only real draw.
[01:15:46] <shibboleth> last power outage in my areas was... 2003?
[01:15:47] <Activ8> my house was south facing, so it got full light 
[01:15:53] <shibboleth> and when they switched to smart meters
[01:16:27] <Activ8> I had smart meters installed as well, I could see what was been used
[01:16:41] <shibboleth> yeah, so would a ups
[01:17:03] <shibboleth> only you end up paying for the smart meter so that they can charge you more for power when you need it
[01:17:26] <shibboleth> "oh, you shower in the morning and cook in the afternoon? everyone knows that's cheaper at night..."
[01:17:36] <signofzeta> My state (Connecticut) doesn't do peak demand or surge pricing.  It's high, but a flat fee.  Still, it's working well for me.
[01:18:40] <shibboleth> "oh, you charge your EV when you're at home? everyone knows that cheaper while you're at work"

[06:57:12] <enix> catbeard: wyd
[06:57:13] <catbeard> actually it is as far as i've been shown the RP config
[06:57:29] <catbeard> but in order to work with our integration, the RP has to pass SNI
[06:57:32] <catbeard> it's not
[06:57:38] <enix> really

[06:58:04] <catbeard> on our end it's nginx lb and container nginx
[06:58:07] *** Joins: seth (sid18070@user/washclof)
[06:58:22] <catbeard> but to get past CF lb, it needs SNI
[06:58:36] <catbeard> so we know it's not our lb or container nginx
[06:58:57] <enix> cf -> ec2 (nginx rev prox) -> ec2 (app)?
[06:59:03] <catbeard> and eng says cloudflare is good
[06:59:21] <enix> yeah they also told me my ELB would pass PCI DSS
[06:59:24] <enix> but here we are
[06:59:35] <catbeard> regular dns -> external RP -> CF IP by DNS -> our LB -> their container
[07:00:26] <enix> why path like that :\
[07:00:31] <enix> so extra
[07:00:37] <catbeard> ddos and ssl management
[07:00:40] <catbeard> they have no choice
[07:00:50] <enix> ssl handoff on their container?
[07:00:50] <catbeard> if they host with us
[07:00:52] <enix> surely not
[07:00:56] <catbeard> on CF LB
[07:01:26] <catbeard> so CF LB terminate ssl and RP's http:// from the internal LB and then to their nginx
[07:01:55] <catbeard> well technically their external RP terminates SSL
[07:02:05] <catbeard> but it backends to a CloudFlare IP
[07:02:14] <catbeard> so it needs SNI to be passed again
[07:02:42] <enix> oh cloudlfare
[07:02:44] <enix> im thinking front
[07:02:48] <enix> wow
[07:03:12] <catbeard> it's pretty ridiculous
[07:03:25] <catbeard> but it works for 99.99999% of our other clients
[07:03:32] <catbeard> even cisco
[07:04:12] <catbeard> when it gets going GOOD GOD it's lightning fast
[07:04:42] <catbeard> some folks are just extra and want that control
[07:05:04] <catbeard> there's also CloudFlare -> CloudFlare integration
[07:05:20] <catbeard> using CNAME flattening
[07:07:40] <catbeard> the only problem comes when you're NOT using cloudflare nameservers, and you have to point to our CloudFlare IP (dedicated to us) using A records, then if you have a zone in a cloudflare account, it interferes because it re-resolves itself through the cloudflare network, even though you don't have their NS set

[11:32:00] <sd> 02<r​yalln> 😄
[11:32:05] <enix> But not all of them are heartless soul suckers. I've worked with heaps of people who are people first
[11:32:24] <Activ8> nah that's all a con lol
[11:32:35] <enix> And I've worked on teams where everyone was genuinely passionate about their job, and the CEO made it a point to make sure everyone had the time they needed to live instead of just work
[11:33:03] <Activ8> managers suck ryalin I hope you got a hard hat with you and an umbrella for that plausible deniability moment. lol
[11:33:17] <enix> The entire team was managed from the point of view of KPIs. Maintain consistent KPIs that help the business, and you can do whatever you want. Take your kids to the park at 3pm? Go for it. Want to wake up at 11am and work till 2am? Go fo rit.
[11:33:32] <xe0n> ah no.. lol
[11:33:38] <sd> 02<r​yalln> well, my thoguht process is. its for a client i left 6 months for. new roll managing my ex employer. The fact its new gives me a chance to build it how I want
[11:33:40] <xe0n> you still need to be working the business hours...
[11:33:44] <Activ8> that's cool - as long as you do your work though and dedicated 100% to the business

[22:51:22] <shibboleth> yeah, it was a fad for consumer/home users. those few years between analog modems and dsl

[22:55:07] <CptLuxx> not the net
[22:55:12] <CptLuxx> you need at least a pbx with a isdn port
[22:55:13] <shibboleth> digital vs analog?
[22:55:14] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> the pbx?

[22:56:22] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> so what?
[22:56:22] <shibboleth> also, wasn't it an rj11 plug but with four leads?
