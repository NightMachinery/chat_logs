[00:22:10] <Kaiod> Well, about the story I was going to tell, I remember when I was in 6th grade, we had to divide the computers and do quick tests that nobody understood, because the system used was proprietary and had limited free licenses. And it charged an exorbitant amount that the school, in this case, could not afford. 
[00:22:10] <Kaiod> Moreover, the state did not invest in learning for the teachers (mainly about alternatives to the proprietary one), the big fact was that they really wanted them not to know, to have difficulty and not to look for alternatives beyond the exorbitantly expensive contracts made between the government and the corporations.
[00:22:19] <Kaiod> During the pandemic, I even reported here a few times about what the state did with the student's and teacher's right to freedom of use.
[00:22:20] <Kaiod> A contract with big Google was made, handing over the data of students and teachers without the consent of parents and the respective owners of this data. We became a Google and government analysis lab, forced to agree to Google's terms and entire policy (either you click "agree" or you don't study, don't get a grade, and grade bomb).
[00:22:46] <ggoes> wow
[00:23:01] <Kaiod> In history, in high school, we hear a lot about democracy, about a free society, and even about the abolition of slavery. But the fact is that this does not reflect reality at all.
[00:23:01] <Kaiod> The big question that does not appear in the history books is that society lives a "digital slavery", where the entire population becomes submissive to large corporations with their proprietary software. From this, democracy is simply an illusion about your security and privacy, which is put at risk every time your information is under the power of the corporations that enslave you.
[00:23:13] <devinu> oh wow
[00:24:45] <zleap> I know some schools here has google classroom but schools are also bound under the gdpr 
[00:24:46] <kompowiec> i send my free software story, great trip to the land of nostalgia
[00:24:52] <V-T60> >either you click "agree" or you don't study, don't get a grade
[00:24:55] <V-T60> that's true
[00:24:57] <ggoes> nice kompowiec, looking forward to it
[00:25:54] <zleap> i am not sure however by using google if schools even comply, unless you run your own server and host it within the gdpr juristiction
[00:26:05] <elshid_> Someday in the future, if humanity does not kill itself, our children or grandchildren or grandgrandchildren our children might learn how we overcame proprietary software.

[00:39:57] <Kaiod> tpefreedom: Hey =)
[00:40:07] <zleap> perhaps people also miss the point of free software,  people have said LibreOffice is not as good as MS office, 
[00:40:13] <kompowiec> Kaiod, indeed, but even in the moments when they are not limited by the network effect, they do not see the motivation to change it, because if proprietary software works for them, it works and they do not want to change.
[00:40:32] <zleap> thing is, is meant to mirror every MS office feature? isn't the point itis free as in freedom
[00:40:37] <kompowiec> or I'm just doing something wrong and can't convince.
[00:40:39] <tpefreedom> Is this for the freedom ladder?
[00:40:50] <zleap> the user empowermeant makes it better in that sense
[00:41:05] <zleap> kompowiec, you wont' convince everyone
[00:41:13] <zleap> which specific book was deleted ?
[00:41:31] <Kaiod> kompowiec: Yes, however, there is a structure that holds this. Several factors give this impression of comfort that make them use the speech "What works well, stays there".
[00:41:34] <kompowiec> 1984, mentioned by stallman in his TED lecture
[00:41:55] <zleap> kompowiec, so maybe collate that together and cite the ted lecture
[00:42:04] <zleap> or cite RMS in the Ted lecture
[00:42:27] <kompowiec> i did it, but currently youtube has disabled adding subtitles in other languages so i can't translate to polish
[00:42:40] <zleap> what about when streaming company X falls out with content owner Y and refuses to stream Ys content despite people  paying for the streaming service
[00:42:52] <zleap> kompowiec, what about peertube
[00:43:14] <kompowiec> yeah i should try it, preferably on the midov.pl server
[00:43:14] <tpefreedom> Is it just me, or is deleting 1984 specifically a very cocky/arrogant/hubris-filled move?
[00:43:31] <zleap> maybe we need other examples
[00:43:39] <ggoes> it's certainly convenient when making points about the general phenomenon
[00:43:50] <ggoes> convenient that they chose that book to exert their unjust power
[00:44:06] <zleap> what about books like Tom Sawyer, the originals would have had language that is now seen as racist, books get updated original versions vanish from book shelves

[00:46:13] <ewwegweg> GNUHacker here
[00:46:20] <Kaiod> zleap: It depends on the point of view. Because proprietary software makes up many governments today, it even controls many governments today.
[00:46:46] <zleap> they are tied in to it
[00:46:49] <zleap> from early on
[00:47:17] <zleap> most colleges offer courses in say MS office, because the employer apparently demands that
[00:47:29] <kompowiec> I think that what hurts users the most is the moment when they have to pay for something out of their own pocket and there they are more motivated to change. But corporate tracking is not as motivating for them anymore.

[00:49:09] <kompowiec> zleap, just as morbidly controlling others eg. in work
[00:49:19] <zleap> nothing much has changed, unless we as a community say we need people with skills in LibreOffice
[00:49:50] <Kaiod> I think that when it hurts the pocket, people are more prone to modification and piracy than to free software. Because the convenience of software is greater than a viable free alternative.
[00:49:53] <zleap> what about if we could get more of the LibreOffice manuals in to peoples hands
[00:50:39] <zleap> if you are not aware an alternative exists, you are going to try and get a pirated copy of cpropriatary software
[00:51:01] <kompowiec> Kaiod, it depends of case. If someone use illegal mod to game and this mod was banned, he'll probably get bored of reinstalling it over and over again.
[00:51:03] <Kaiod> zleap: The point is to change it little by little. The deconstruction is constant and must be done conscientiously, explaining and teaching, until it is finally migrated to free software.
[00:51:30] <zleap> if people see you use LibreOffice daily they are curious as it looks different
[00:51:39] <zleap> it removes the idea no one uses it
[00:51:54] <zleap> also if they need help,  are people able / willing to step up and help
[00:52:06] <kompowiec> there must probably be some pain threshold that users can endure.

[01:07:00] <zleap> i think the idea is to also demonstrate the software can be used

[01:08:59] <zleap> we may not like them, BUT we are trying to convince end users, who are not in to LaTeX, emacs etc to use an alternative to MS office
[01:09:28] <kompowiec> I still have a problem when I have to fill a document in the office and I have to agree to a compromise that I send in .doc and .odt format
[01:09:37] <kompowiec> goverment office*
[01:09:48] <zleap> odt is a recognised standard here

[01:17:34] <zleap> turn 90
[01:17:36] <kompowiec> and writing a normal program is more fun. At least that's how I felt it at school.

[09:20:38] <labrador> epony, I was asking about gpg....
[09:21:45] <epony> Boycott Apple is the only way to have better outcome than that, and then apply same tooling (boycott and ostracise avoid completely) all products and services that damage society, humanity and freedoms and dignities of people.
[09:22:44] <labrador> epony, why do you keep ranting at the same thing for soo long
[09:22:47] <epony> Same tooling can be APPLE-ied to other companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Oracle, Facebook, etc.
[09:22:52] <labrador> Even when no one else actually cares
[09:24:13] <epony> There was someone with the nickname of Apple which is annoying to people who know the real damage that Apple causes on freedoms and liberties of hardware and software and industry wide problems.
[09:25:20] <GoatAvenger> eponymous..
[09:25:25] <epony> There are far too many Apple advocates and Apple produce covert and overt marketing underdealers on most functional programming and deviant minority groups online.
[09:26:10] <labrador> ok man
[09:26:12] <labrador> Its fine
[09:26:15] <labrador> calm down now
[09:26:59] <SchmoSeph> what avout the users that simply prefer apple because of its familiarity
[09:27:20] <SchmoSeph> or maybe because they learned on one and stuc
[09:27:53] <GoatAvenger> SchmoSeph, they must find liberation..
[09:27:57] <epony> repeating the same set of mistakes for 40 years is not an incident
[09:28:17] <labrador> SchmoSeph, nothing can be done except telling them using a free OS is a good idea
[09:28:41] <labrador> But somebody who is 'stuck' on apple is probably too low skilled to even install another OS
[09:28:56] <labrador> let alone figure out how to use it
[09:29:26] <epony> it is not the users failure that a company abuses them knowingly or not-knowingly, it is the fault of the company that mistreats their customers' naive gullible nature
[09:29:51] <labrador> epony, at some point you cannot regulate capitalism
[09:29:59] <labrador> The users must take care of themselves
[09:31:22] <epony> you can do everything, one person at a time or all persons at once
[09:34:00] <epony> have a nice day and happy hacking!

[14:44:03] <Kaiod> <labrador> "My college just sent me a google..." <- Your college sent you a form for what exactly?
[14:45:15] <labrador> For stuff Kaiod,the point is that I do need to fill it.
[14:45:32] <kompowiec> ask for PDF
[14:45:55] <labrador> you know what,good idea. That should be acceptable
[14:45:58] <kompowiec> or even unfortunate .doc/.odt
[14:46:04] <labrador> I'll try
[14:46:10] <kompowiec> :)
[14:46:24] <Kaiod> labrador: Well, then you can ask them to send you the answers by e-mail anyway, they will see
[14:47:04] <labrador> yeah
[14:47:46] <Kaiod> You try to clarify your point, but if they don't understand and force you to fill it out, ask them if there is any regulation, official letter, or circular from the responsible department of education about sending this information by form.
[14:48:27] <Kaiod> Another point, would be that you could claim that it is defective and won't work for you (depending on the system you use, it won't work at all).
[14:49:23] <Kaiod> And ask the institution about the protection and use of this data, if possible, the education organization's regulations on data use, protection and management.
[14:50:19] <kompowiec> meh, rossman in poland save each data to 10 years, even if you just sent CV
[14:50:27] <kompowiec> absolutely disgusting
[14:51:12] <labrador> Kaiod, yeah its kindof weird that they are asking me to fill a google form with such sensitive details. Probably could be some student privacy protection or something

[16:16:57] <irelativism> Hey there! I intend to relaunch the coversation of the trademark restrictions of RUSTlang within the newly created foundation and would be great for those here who show interest or if wanted support to see if the movement gets the ball rolling again regarding this important matter, especially given the addition of more and more RUST modules on the linux kernel. Thanks for understanding Cheers Irelativism.

[20:51:31] <jacobk> I found some software that I think might be free, but it's not in the Free Software Directory, and I'm not sure how best to tell. I've done some searches on the Participate page and it seems every .java file but 1 is licensed, though there's also a license in the root directory.

[20:54:12] <tfisgnag> craigt: I can't get off of my mind something you said while we were reviewing Mailvelope. I think you said we were done with it but that things could be made better if we went through all the items the FSD's forms have for Mailvelope. Do I recall correctly?
[20:54:19] <jacobk> Though, that's a modified version of a different piece of software that's also not in the FSD
[20:54:56] <craigt> jacobk: Eep! Google drive is no good to us because it requires running non-free javascript. Is there another place?
[20:55:24] <jacobk> The link I posted does not require any JavaScript
[20:55:30] <craigt> tfisgnag: Yes, there is a great deal of detail you can add to an entry.

[21:42:04] <jacobk> not sure what "(and most commercial purposes)" means but it sounds bad
[21:42:10] <craigt> jacobk: those are both non-free files and would be problematic for entry in the FSD.
[21:42:25] <craigt> jacobk: Yea, that's a restriction on freedom 0.
[21:42:38] <jacobk> craigt: The song's not a problem right? Since it's an artistic work and not code.
[21:44:20] <jacobk> The "long version" of the code license includes "Does the work compete with O'Reilly? For example, if you are a book publisher, you can't use anything from our books without our permission.", so that source file is definitely nonfree.
[21:44:26] <craigt> jacobk: Hmm... maybe. We would have to take a closer look, but MARSPlus still has an issue with not providing all the source code.
[21:45:04] <jacobk> Yeah, and since MARSPlus is based on MARS, it probably also includes the nonfree code.

[21:46:34] <craigt> jacobk: Yes, I saw the song in both.
[21:47:49] <craigt> jacobk: Yes, both are trying to be free software by overall being licensed under the Expat license https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:Expat
[21:48:17] *** Quits: garjola (~garjola@user/garjola) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[21:48:36] <craigt> jacobk: And reaching out to the developers is the next step, but how active are these projects? MARS definitely looks idle.
[21:49:57] <craigt> jacobk: typically with an available repository, one would file a bug report.
[21:50:14] <jacobk> craigt: Both seem inactive, but MARS for 8 years and MARSPlus for 4 years. But, both projects have email addresses.
[21:50:19] <zleap> it would be good to identify projects that are no longer maintained and see if we can find  a way to revive the useful projects 
[21:50:28] <craigt> zleap: +1
[21:51:03] <craigt> With the Expat license, forking is also an option.
[21:51:25] <zleap> yea,  as long as people know the fork exists
[21:51:47] <craigt> an option that would allow the fork to be under the AGPLv3-or-later if one wished.
[21:51:56] <zleap> +1
[21:52:06] <zleap> there are lots of orphaned projects it seems
[21:52:16] <jacobk> If neither project wants to put in the effort to remove the nonfree parts, then we would list only the fork in the FSD
[21:52:23] *** Joins: garjola (~garjola@user/garjola)
[21:52:30] <craigt> jacobk: BTW, we found those files by using the scancode-toolkit.
[21:52:48] <zleap> what is removing the nonfree parts is not as easy as first thought
[21:53:53] <jacobk> craigt: I'll install scancode-toolkit, and maybe it should be mentioned on the Participate page? In addition to licensecheck and fossology, I mean.
[21:53:54] <craigt> creating a fork is beyond the scope of this Directory meeting.
[21:54:31] <craigt> jacobk: Agreed. We've have been working on improving the participate page.
[21:54:47] <jacobk> I'll email both projects I guess: MARS to ask them to add information to the statement that the software is open-source, and MARSPlus to ask for the complete source code.
[21:55:27] <craigt> jacobk: Go for it!
[21:56:50] <craigt> jacobk: That is how the process goes.
[21:59:23] * craigt is back looking at https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/AdaVenture
[21:59:53] <jacobk> craigt: Also, something that I think would be useful, would be a "rejected software" list, similar to libregamewiki's "Rejected games list" (https://libregamewiki.org/Libregamewiki:Rejected_games_list). That way, if someone else sees MARS and thinks that it is free, they could search the rejected page and easily see that we have already determined the software to be nonfree.
[22:00:48] <craigt> jacobk: Have you been secretly looking at our job notes?! 
[22:00:54] <zleap> lol
[22:00:58] <craigt> jacobk: We've been working on this as well!
[22:01:03] <jacobk> haha
[22:01:12] <craigt> jacobk: Even considered a separate wiki.
[22:01:26] <jacobk> the Proprietary Software Directory?
[22:01:43] <jacobk> hehe
[22:01:59] <craigt> We don't need to list programs that we know will never be free (i.e. photoshop, etc.)
[22:02:25] <craigt> But programs trying to be free... It seems useful, and reduces redundancies.
[22:03:52] <craigt> and gives a path for a program to become free software.
[22:03:57] *** Quits: myzhang1029 (~Thunderbi@64.251.74.34) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[22:03:58] <jacobk> Though, it probably wouldn't hurt to list Photoshop if people do sometimes ask if it is free. And it could be a place to list alrternatives, why it's nonfree, etc.
[22:04:33] <craigt> jacobk: True. And it is an opportunity to steer them toward GIMP.
[22:04:53] <zleap> craigt, I am filling out the LP registration form, if I am a volunteer do I tick Participant ?
[22:04:58] <jacobk> craigt: I was just about to say, there could be a section on what would need to be done in order to make something free software, and for Photoshop it would say to use GIMP or something lol

[22:05:42] *** Joins: aHick (~memes@143.60.229.4)
[22:05:45] <jacobk> But for MARS, it might say, remove this one piece of code and try to make the software compile without it

[22:29:27] <tfisgnag> While I was reading it and taking some notes I remembered I have had other questions that were not related with 8.Etc but were related to the FSD.
[22:29:42] <tfisgnag> Do you mind if we leave the 8.Etc questions and eventually some of the FSD questions for the next week's meeting?
[22:29:51] <craigt> tfisgnag: No surprise. There is a lot going on in there.
[22:30:37] <fsdbot> We're are entering the third hour of the Free Software Directory meeting. If it is your first time joining us, please check out the participation guide: https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Free_Software_Directory:Participate
[22:30:38] <craigt> tfisgnag: you can always email me questions as well craigt@fsf.org, although I probably won't be able to get to them until the next FSD meeting.
[22:32:31] <tfisgnag> craigt: Thank you for that offer. I will have a busy week ahead, so unless something unexpected happens I'll leave my questions for the next meeting. OK?

[22:55:53] <irelativism> Hey there! I intend to relaunch the coversation of the trademark restrictions of RUSTlang within the newly created foundation and would be great for those here who show interest or if wanted support to see if the movement gets the ball rolling again regarding this important matter, especially given the addition of more and more RUST modules on the linux kernel. Thanks for understanding Cheers Irelativism.

[23:07:50] <GNUHacker> hwpplayer1: 3,3nice
[23:08:05] <jacobk> craigt: Do you think this is a good change to suggest to MARS?: 
[23:08:05] <jacobk> replace "MARS is open-source software." with "MARS is mostly open-source software. It includes some non-open-source source code under the O'Reilly policy described at http://www.oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/ask_tim/2001/codepolicy.html".
[23:08:49] <GNUHacker> jacobk: https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
[23:09:18] <hwpplayer1> I see a green color maybe a flag 10,99GNUHacke99,99r
[23:09:46] <jacobk> GNUHacker: I know, but the MARS website already said "open-source"; they never claimed MARS was free software (well not in the sense we use it anyway (not referring to price either lol)).
[23:10:12] <craigt> GNUHacker: Hello!
[23:10:21] <GNUHacker> craigt: hi
[23:10:29] <jacobk> Not important, but here's a message from the main page: "MARS 4.3 is 100% FREE, which means it does not contain any form of malware, including spyware, viruses, trojans and backdoors."
[23:10:56] <hwpplayer1>  
[23:11:15] <GNUHacker> hwpplayer1: just black
[23:11:20] <craigt> jacobk: Well I would personally say MARS is mostly free software... :) https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.en.html
[23:11:26] <craigt> GNUHacker beat me too it.
[23:11:31] <craigt> *to
[23:12:33] <craigt> jacobk: I would ask if they would be willing to remove the nonfree files.
[23:13:51] <hwpplayer1> Do they have an irc channel 
[23:13:57] <zleap> is there a cheaper way to get stickers sent from your website 
[23:14:54] <craigt> hwpplayer1: Probably not. It is a fairly old project.
[23:15:32] <craigt> jacobk: You can make your suggestion at the same time. It is not accurate that it says "100% Free".
[23:16:35] <jacobk> craigt: I think, they are using "FREE" in a sense different from ours; I think it has something to do with Softpedia or something?
[23:16:43] <jacobk> http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/Softpedia_Free.gif
[23:17:16] <jacobk> "MARS has been tested in the Softpedia labs using several industry-leading security solutions and found to be completely clean of adware/spyware components"
[23:17:17] *** Quits: hwpplayer1 (~hwpplayer@user/hwpplayer1) (Quit: Quit)
[23:17:49] <jacobk> They don't mention anything about source code or licensing there, so I think Softpedia's "FREE" just means not malware basically
[23:18:04] *** Joins: hwpplayer1 (~hwpplayer@user/hwpplayer1)
[23:18:40] <craigt> jacobk: What does MARS even do?
[23:18:57] <jacobk> craigt: It's an assembler for the MIPS architecture
[23:19:02] <zleap> ah
[23:19:27] *** Joins: KUrare__ (~KUrare@user/kurare)
[23:20:09] <craigt> Hah! This whole time I thought it had something to do with the actual planet. Pffft!
[23:20:52] <zleap> craigt, yeah it does seem to be a confusing name
[23:21:46] <jacobk> I didn't take Softpedia seriously at first, but looking at their website they list things like Pixelorama and JShelter towards the top, so maybe I'm wrong about them. And Microsoft Edge is marked as "100% CLEAN" instead of "100% FREE", so maybe they are actually using "FREE" in a similar sense to ours.
[23:22:05] <craigt> zleap: And they have picture of Mars on the university home page!
[23:22:16] <hwpplayer1> Did you think that it is all about Mars planet and our Earth

[23:23:11] <hwpplayer1> 0
[23:23:12] <zleap> craigt, me too,  at least at first, 
[23:23:40] <craigt> Is MIPS still a thing? (I have no idea)
[23:24:06] <hwpplayer1> Sorry i can not hold the phone truly
[23:24:09] <zleap> debian still runs in mips
[23:24:14] <zleap> on mips
[23:24:22] <zleap> iirc Millons of instructions per second
[23:25:06] <White_Flame> "Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages"
[23:25:07] <jacobk> Yep, I was wrong about Softpedia: https://www.softpedia.com/user/licensing_free.php (somewhat misleading suggesting that free=GPL, but MARS is not GPL so I think the certification actually does mean free in our sense)
[23:25:46] <zleap> White_Flame, oh sorry
[23:25:48] <zleap> https://www.debian.org/releases/bookworm/releasenotes.en.html
[23:26:27] <jacobk> So, maybe I should email Softpedia also, to tell them they made a mistake ;)
[23:26:27] *** Joins: adduc (~adduc@24.15.97.76)
[23:26:37] <zleap> i think doing that search proves a point,  that was top of tjhe list,  for deb 12,  below that was alink to release notes for Debian 3 !!! no wonder people can't find info on things
[23:27:38] <craigt> jacobk: It won't hurt to try.
[23:28:11] <White_Flame> huh, according to wikipedia "In March 2021, MIPS announced that the development of the MIPS architecture had ended as the company is making the transition to RISC-V."
[23:29:03] <White_Flame> of course there are still MIPS licensees
[23:29:13] <craigt> White_Flame: I was also reading the wikipedia page.
[23:29:32] <hwpplayer1> Could you please tell me the Mars web site link ?
[23:30:03] <jacobk> Actually, the page from Softpedia also says "freeware" can be called "100% Free" if it is free for personal and commercial use, so maybe MARS fits the certification because it's restrictions are on copying? I'll see if I can get a clarification though.
