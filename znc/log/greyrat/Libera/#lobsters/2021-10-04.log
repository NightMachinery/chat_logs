[00:06:02] <martian67|> probly uses some magic related to that
[00:06:57] <ignaloidas> if you cut between I frames then everything should be fine without re-encoding

[00:07:33] <ignaloidas> and I think youtube has I frames every second or so, should check that
[00:07:49] <martian67|> youtube uses DASH
[00:07:57] <martian67|> so the concept of I frames really isn't relevant
[00:08:13] <martian67|> unless you use older youtube formats when you playback
[00:08:20] <martian67|> not sure how big the DASH chunks are

[00:08:26] <mockturtle> [ Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP - Wikipedia ] - en.wikipedia.org
[00:08:27] <ignaloidas> it is, it's in the compression algorithm anyways
[00:08:47] <ignaloidas> I frames are the image frames, as opposed to motion frames
[00:09:09] <ignaloidas> that is, they encode the full information of a particular frame
[00:09:16] <martian67|> dash chunks are usually so small there is one  I frame per dash chunk
[00:09:47] <ignaloidas> or less, depends
[00:09:54] <martian67|> there cant be less
[00:09:58] <martian67|> that would break DASH

[00:30:12] <imode> what is the ideal word size for a virtual machine?
[00:30:39] <imode> been rattling this around my circles. assume that you can't do byte addressing.
[00:31:03] <imode> (unless your word size is a byte, that is.)
[00:32:45] <moony> probably the platform's native word size
[00:33:03] <imode> assume you didn't know it.
[00:33:09] <imode> you're deciding that word size.
[00:33:23] <moony> i usually make a word 16-bit just out of sheer habit
[00:33:40] <moony> for the nice clean char=8, short=16, int=32, long=64
[00:34:09] <imode> bear in mind you'll also have to do loads/stores and arithmetic in that word.
[00:34:13] <imode> that word size, rather.
[00:34:30] <moony> oh, then 64-bit, simply because that's the ideal address size for a modern system
[00:34:44] <imode> that'll exclude you from some MCUs.
[00:34:50] <imode> ...and WASM...
[00:35:17] <moony> <imode> assume you didn't know it.
[00:35:46] <ignaloidas> and limit you to 64KB of ram if you put it at 16 :)
[00:36:13] <imode> right, you don't know what the actual word size is, but that doesn't mean you don't know the word sizes of common platforms at the low and high end of the spec.
[00:36:23] <imode> ignaloidas: unless you do freaky addressing.
[00:36:30] <ignaloidas> (assuming you don't go and do adressing with several words)
[00:36:30] <moony> you're giving too little info to give a good idea for a word sizwe
[00:36:44] *** Quits: califax (~califax@user/califx) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:36:57] <imode> that's kind of the point, moony. I've been looking at uxn and other VMs and I was like "why".
[00:37:41] <imode> their stuff is all 8-bit with 16-bit addressing.
[00:38:12] <imode> which is neat! but clearly there's some intent to choosing word size for newer VMs that isn't just "match whatever the word size is for the most popular consumer platform".
[00:38:31] <ignaloidas> I think it's because of the idea
[00:38:40] *** Joins: califax (~califax@user/califx)
[00:38:44] <ignaloidas> the idea is "something simple that can run on whatever"
[00:38:57] <imode> yeah but that "whatever" set needs to be defined.
[00:38:59] <ignaloidas> and running on whatever leaves you 8 bits
[00:39:08] <ignaloidas> well, their whatever is a gameboy
[00:39:39] <imode> wasn't there someone who built a turing machine simulator and hooked it up to a screen.
[00:39:48] * drobilla votes 32
[00:39:51] <ignaloidas> there's not much that doesn't do 8 bits
[00:40:19] <imode> kinda surprised that bit vector machines aren't more of a thing.
[00:40:35] <imode> or bit-serial stuff.
[00:40:37] <ignaloidas> also, note that uxn is built very similarly to gemini, from it's page, "It was designed with an implementation-first mindset"
[00:40:47] <imode> I like that mindset.
[00:41:48] <drobilla> TBH whenever I see bit-based vanity architectures I immediately think "ah, so you have no idea how actual computers work at all"
[00:42:03] <imode> elaborate?
[00:42:11] <drobilla> I know that's not fair or whatever, but it's what happens :)
[00:42:51] <ignaloidas> I think that mindset leaves a platform with no real uses
[00:43:25] <ignaloidas> e.g. see how gemini is mostly used (for blogging about gemini itself)
[00:43:30] <drobilla> imode: Not sure if I can.  I may have just spent too much time teaching people who are noobs the low-level universe
[00:44:04] <imode> I don't think Gemini and Uxn are in the same vein, Gemini's restrictions don't really permit a lot of creativity.
[00:44:22] <drobilla> noobs in*
[00:44:38] <imode> drobilla: what do you mean by bit-based vanity architectures?
[00:45:20] <drobilla> imode: I don't even know, really.  Kind of anything that pretends bit-addressable is feasible, I guess
[00:46:45] <ignaloidas> imode, I guess, but it's very similar in that it was designed as an implementation first, usecase second, and while gemini is more restrictive, their both usecases are quite limiting
[00:47:13] <technomancy> uxn is pretty specifically recreational tho, right?
[00:47:21] <ignaloidas> e.g. you won't be doing circuit design in uxn, even though you can in WASM
[00:47:23] <imode> ignaloidas: I think there's an interesting line to be drawn between restrictive computing platforms and restrictive protocols. the former can be "built up" to do really interesting things. the latter... can't. there's a ceiling.
[00:47:29] <ignaloidas> technomancy, yeah, pretty sure
[00:47:33] <imode> I dunno, Chuck Moore does all of his stuff in what, 17 bits?
[00:47:47] <imode> EDA design tools and all.
[00:47:49] <drobilla> Gemini is a weird one for me because I too am prone to heavily prioritizing simplicity of implementation, and think that's very important, but.... too far, I guess
[00:48:00] <ignaloidas> imode, I mean, yeah, if you're turing complete anything can be built up, but will it?
[00:48:15] <imode> that's a function of popularity.
[00:48:19] <ignaloidas> see: brainfuck et al
[00:48:27] <imode> I mean there's been a bunch of cool stuff in BF.
[00:49:51] <imode> is DCPU-16 still "popular"?
[00:49:56] <imode> there was a hell of a buzz around that.
[00:50:48] <drobilla> I often find myself wishing that this sort of retro renaissance would produce something with a similar, uh, vibe, but without the 8 or 16 bit parts
[00:51:10] <drobilla> Like, I'd like to have a machine that turns on instantly and gives you / the program absolute control over everything
[00:51:20] <drobilla> But I very do not want to deal with banked addressing and shit in 2021

[01:27:52] <meff[m]> imode: you should read some of the papers that described why various real life architectures in the past went with the word size they did
[01:27:55] <meff[m]> there's like thousands of reasons why
[01:28:31] <imode> meff[m]: oh granted, granted. things like tags and such.
[01:28:42] <meff[m]> haha yeah
[01:28:56] <meff[m]> some have "aged" poorly in that it might have been easier to source two 8 bit registers than one 16 bit register
[01:29:06] <meff[m]> so they invented some addressing mode that uses two registers for lookup
[01:29:34] <imode> yyyup, intimiately familiar with that.. X and Y on the 650X.
[01:29:44] <imode> *intimately
[01:30:20] <meff[m]> 🙂
[01:30:44] <meff[m]> as for why uxn went with 16 bit operands but 8 bit addressing... I have no friggin idea
[01:31:11] <meff[m]> like Chuck Moore's weird instruction sets are often a consequence of the hardware he's making and the Forth he wants to run atop those instructions
[01:31:43] <imode> oh it's the other way around.
[01:31:48] <imode> 8 bit registers, 16 bit addressing.
[01:31:55] <meff[m]> er oops brain fart, 8 bit registers, 16 bit addressing
[01:32:06] <meff[m]> I would have probably unified the word sizes for registers and addresses simply because it's easier to hold in your head that way IMHO
[01:32:35] <meff[m]> I wonder if they did this specifically because a 32/64 bit architecture can wastefully represent 8 bit registers but an 8 bit machine can't feasibly represent a 16 bit register
[01:33:03] <imode> not unless you delegate it to some faaaaast RAM.
[01:33:19] <ignaloidas> or merge registers, but have fun with that

[04:19:56] <imode> because the true drive of popularity is use in the workplace.
[04:20:07] <imode> that's the golden curse.

[04:23:42] <ignaloidas> the best minimal language for the workplace is a DSL you build in a workplace, and those are both rarely built, and rarely shared
[04:23:55] <imode> tell me about it..
[04:24:09] <imode> amazon has an entire lisp dialect. I spend most of my time writing in it.
[04:24:42] <imode> lotta mini languages.
[04:33:27] <companion_cube> You work at Amazon imode? I forgot
[04:33:40] <imode> yep.
[04:34:54] <companion_cube> What's the custom lisp for?
[04:35:32] <imode> dealing with amazon's other custom data format, Ion.
[04:35:37] <imode> https://amzn.github.io/ion-docs/
[04:35:38] <mockturtle> [ Amazon Ion ] - amzn.github.io
[04:35:47] <imode> which our services speak.
[04:37:40] <companion_cube> You mean the ion tooling is written in this custom lisp?
[04:38:14] <imode> eeeeh, more that the lisp was written to ease the burden off of the tooling.
[04:38:44] <companion_cube> Lisp is pretty ok for custom languages anyway
[04:38:46] <imode> we're primarily Java.
[04:38:48] <companion_cube> Cheap to implement
[04:39:33] <imode> since Ion can store s-expressions, we can store and pass code around.
[04:39:42] <imode> which is more chaotic than you'd think.

[14:24:30] <dsc_> epilys: i've seen your code, if I compare that to some people I know that *do* have a job, it is "funny"
[14:24:33] <kline> epilys, are they being forced, though
[14:24:43] <epilys> got through everything with flying colors only to get a video call interview with the CEO who hastily ended the interview and then I got an email from HR that the CEO was looking for more senior people

[14:27:15] <kline> epilys, then just move on. if they ask you to do something you cant/wont do, because of time, or even just dignity, ditch them

[14:47:52] <epilys> dsc_, yeah right? Some employers here in Greece pay you every 14 days but why stop there? you could pay each day when it's clocked easily.
[14:48:00] <rhn> finding a good candidate also costs them money, so you might not be so out of luck
[14:48:33] <epilys> rhn, I didn't quite understand what you're saying

[14:51:31] <kline> every transaction has an overhead though, so the more often you are paid the less salary gets to your pocket
[14:51:42] <rhn> this^ especially when crossing the border
[14:52:14] <rhn> it may end up being a pain when you have to file all the tax returns and match payments to invoices
[14:52:20] <epilys> you're paid in your employer's bank i.e. you have to have an account at their bank so the transaction is free
[14:52:51] <rhn> this is weird
[14:52:59] <epilys> that's just the system here
[14:53:27] <kline> epilys, that removes some of the cost but not still the cost of daily processing of payroll, audits, adminstration of transactions, etc
[14:53:31] <rhn> so when you sign a work contract, you also have to sign a bank contract?
[14:54:10] <epilys> rhn, yes but it's an deposit account contract
[14:54:45] <rhn> crazy, but not the craziest I've seen

[15:07:53] <ignaloidas> here almost any business with reccuring payments can issue bills straight to your bank via some agreement, and you can either handle them manually or set the bank to automatically pay for them on issue, on the last day, or 3 days before the last day
[15:08:55] <wink> never heard of such a thing, we only have direct debit

[19:36:05] <rhn> the web server has no human user interface, but I'm not sure I'd call it a lib either
[19:36:22] <futurepasta> maybe because the washing machine's interface is mainly used for interacting with the physical machine itself. Then again, you could say the same about an app which lets you lock/unlock your car.
[19:36:49] <rhn> I think "app" and "lib" aren't very good lines along which to split things

[19:39:12] <futurepasta> if by app you simply mean something that can be executed, then maybe. Kind of like how Rust let's you define a crate as a binary or a library (or both)

[21:05:32] <af> mweberxyz: it is, but I'm wondering how many engineers will remember it in a situation like this with a company wide outage
[21:05:37] <wink> manicennui: interestingly I logged in yesterday. my last post before that was from 2018
[21:05:50] <wink> manicennui: call that "use" if you want. I don't
[21:05:52] <maskd> Cloudflare is having to deal with this now https://twitter.com/jgrahamc/status/1445066136547217413
[21:05:53] <meff[m]> Probably a lot. At large scales, thundering herds are pretty frequent
[21:05:54] <ignaloidas> varjag, hey, at least they know that IRC will work no matter what :)
[21:05:59] <imode> let it buuuuurn~
[21:06:22] <meff[m]> Whenever we have issues and roll those issues back, we get thundering herd effects from retries
[21:06:31] <technomancy> burn it all the way down and salt the ashes
[21:06:57] <manicennui> After the apocalypse, everyone will receive monthly Facebook updates on CD-ROMs.
[21:07:02] <af> meff[m]: I don't know about that. We're not talking about a regional outage. And fb's apps specifically buffer a lot of data.
[21:07:16] <imode> manicennui: I would not mind that, tbh.
[21:07:32] <meff[m]> af: Sure but they probably have all sorts of ways to shed load
[21:07:33] <varjag> well that's easy, they should just resolve facebook.com to 127.0.0.
[21:07:34] <varjag> 1
[21:07:44] <meff[m]> Like already built into their systems
[21:07:56] <imode> unfortunately, I'm sure they'll be back up in a few hours.
[21:07:56] <af> meff[m]: yea I guess they do
[21:08:00] <imode> unless this is an attack.
[21:08:03] <imode> in which case... go whoever's attacking.
[21:08:15] <imode> do twitter next.
[21:08:16] <manicennui> Zuck decided that Facebook is too good for all of you.
[21:08:20] <af> meff[m]: I'd still be curious to see how much the initial spike is in this case
[21:08:28] <meff[m]> Yeah that would be fun heh
[21:08:29] <manicennui> He'll restore access when you all improve.
[21:08:33] <technomancy> I'd be super impressed if this wasn't self-inflicted
[21:08:34] <ignaloidas> average DC usage should be engineered to use around 30% on average, so thundering herd might not be that heavy
[21:08:46] * Teckla has never signed up for, or used, Facebook.
[21:08:52] <Teckla> Sometimes, you have to take a stand against evil.
[21:08:59] <af> like if google goes down (not gmail), there is no data specifically buffered by google's own client software waiting to just thrash the servers
[21:09:00] <imode> Teckla: and yet you probably have a shadow account there.
[21:09:03] <imode> :\
[21:09:04] <manicennui> I thought you all used "the cloud" to deal with usage spikes.
[21:09:08] <Teckla> imode: That seems likely.  :(
[21:09:19] <af> idk if gmail's clients buffer the outbox, but presumably plenty of email clients do
[21:09:24] <imode> we need PBS, but for social media.
[21:09:29] <imode> something tightly regulated.
[21:09:36] <Teckla> Time to bring back POTS and modems
[21:10:05] <af> but facebook uniquely makes applications which all run on user generated data, buffer them on failure, and that is their number 1 source of traffic presumably
[21:10:28] <varjag> manicennui: facebook is some php forum right… they should just spin up a few instances on heroku or something
[21:10:42] <imode> god I wish I lived in a timeline where you were right, varjag.
[21:10:49] <Teckla> Go back to POTS, modems, BASIC, and assembly language.  Start over, and get it right this time.  :D
[21:10:50] <manicennui> varjag: Have they looked into dreamhost?
[21:11:19] <manicennui> Teckla: I can get behind POTS and modems, but let's go back to lisp.
[21:11:22] <mweberxyz> facebook also has to engineer for extraordinary peak load events (new years @ midnight comes to mind) if they come back online at 3pm on a Monday will the load really surpass those events?
[21:11:25] <goodger> except that we're then stuck with all of those awful technologies

[22:13:28] <mouseghost> yeah telegrams having issues since some time ago
[22:13:28] <defect> telegram has been working for me

[22:15:38] <meff[m]> oh lol
[22:15:52] <varjag> we must be witnessing an internet chain reaction
[22:15:56] <ignaloidas> mouseghost, I saw people claiming on downdetector that facebook was hosted by AWS, so that means that AWS is down
[22:16:07] <ngoldbaum> i could see this being some engineer with top-level access internally at facebook going out with a blaze of glory because of the wsj leaks

[22:38:47] <drakonis> its all discord's fault

[22:38:52] <jazz> file uploading, caching
[22:38:54] <imode> they're building to compete with discord.
[22:39:04] <drakonis> clearly
[22:39:20] <imode> which is great for them. but I don't need a discord competitor. and what I mean by that is, I don't need my host instance to be able to scale up automagically to the level of 500+ users.
[22:39:35] <imode> everybody focuses on the large instead of the small these days.
[22:39:36] <drakonis> that repo is a WIP anyways
[22:39:48] <drakonis> discord servers can have 30k+ users at a given time
[22:39:49] <drakonis> lol
[22:39:55] <drakonis> thanks elixir
[22:39:57] <imode> yeah, and I don't need that.
[22:40:07] <imode> most people don't.
[22:40:33] <imode> we wonder why things are so hard for people to host, why there's no self-hosted revolution, when we engineer the things we use to be bigger and handle more loads than they realistically need.
[22:40:36] <jazz> that doesn't mean they need to arbitrarily make their software -worse-
[22:40:48] <jazz> hosting redis in a docker container uses very little resources
[22:40:50] <drakonis> https://github.com/insertish/awesome-revolt feature-wise its already better than discord
[22:40:51] <mockturtle> [ GitHub - insertish/awesome-revolt: Collection of Revolt libraries, bots, clients and other cool stuff. ] - github.com

[22:41:03] <companion_cube> imode: self hosting is inherently hard
[22:41:11] <imode> companion_cube: self-hosting is hard because we fuckin' make it hard.
[22:41:13] <companion_cube> that's why there's no self hosting revolution
[22:41:13] <jazz> because in certain situations caching thru redis is a lot faster than db lookups
[22:41:24] <ignaloidas> redis is fine as a dependency imo
[22:41:25] <bkero> Why isn't it optional?
[22:41:26] <companion_cube> it's always harder than already hosted, ignaloidas
[22:41:26] <imode> jazz: why do I need to be faster when I'm hosting 30 people.
[22:41:33] <jazz> then don't use it
[22:41:41] <imode> what's the alternative.
[22:41:48] <imode> my point is, make small fuckin' software.
[22:41:50] <ignaloidas> companion_cube, I'm assuming that you meant imode
[22:41:55] <companion_cube> ga
[22:41:58] <companion_cube> yes
[22:41:59] <drakonis> bkero: because of discord's design?

[22:42:16] <bkero> drakonis: For small instances, caching isn't going to matter much
[22:42:16] <rb> drakonis: max limit on discord is 250k users
[22:42:17] <imode> redis is a service that you need to run that has its own level of insecurities that you need to manage.
[22:42:17] <jazz> having a db and cachign layer is not complicated
[22:42:18] <drakonis> y'all keep forgetting how it works
[22:42:36] <imode> why the hell is mongodb there.
[22:42:40] <drakonis> because
[22:42:41] <drakonis> again
[22:42:46] <imode> stupid bloated tech shit.
[22:42:46] <drakonis> discord features like file uploading
[22:42:52] <imode> thelounge has file uploading.
[22:43:00] <jazz> having an external db is not "stupid bloated tech shit"
[22:43:00] <drakonis> provided by?
[22:43:04] <drobilla> I mean.... you need to store stuff somewhere
[22:43:07] <imode> ...the file system.
[22:43:11] <ignaloidas> you certainly don't need mongo for file uploads
[22:43:25] <ignaloidas> filesystem, of if you're desperate, something S3 compatable
[22:43:27] <bkero> Back when programs wrote sqlalchemy they could target mysql/postgres/sqlite for small installations.
[22:43:29] <drakonis> you can upload a lot of shit in there
[22:43:37] <drakonis> like
[22:43:38] <jazz> they should have an option to choose different DB adapters, but it's more work to maintain for different DBs
[22:43:43] <ignaloidas> mongo is a great way to make your file uploads slow
[22:43:43] <bkero> sqlite is about as simple as it gets and is just fine for small number of users
[22:43:44] <drakonis> crazy amount of these
[22:43:53] <imode> bkero: amen.
[22:44:15] <imode> every one of these projects feels like "I want to show something off on my resume".
[22:44:22] <drakonis> doesnt look like file uploading is on revolt yet lol
[22:44:37] <imode> instead of "Here are the problems, let us address them in a minimal fashion, and then open the rest up to the communities that use our solutions."
[22:44:40] <drobilla> imode: Fair enough, but nice and simple as it may be, using the filesystem for such things certainly isn't without its issues...
[22:44:49] <drakonis> revolt is not decentralized and federated like matrix btw
[22:44:53] <imode> of course. but it's certainly less of a dependency.
[22:44:56] <drakonis> another thing i should point out
[22:44:56] <drobilla> (that said mongodb and redis does seem a bit much.  Trendy shit)
[22:45:00] <drakonis> rocket chat is also pretty neat?
[22:45:15] <drakonis> also needs mongodb i think?
[22:45:25] <imode> I... haven't given that a solid look-over, but they pivoted to "it's FOSS!" to a pricing-first enterprisey shit model iirc.
[22:45:41] <jazz> mongo came out in 2009. calling it "trendy" is a bit hilarious
[22:45:43] <imode> I know I considered it.
[22:45:57] <ignaloidas> redis is fine as a dependency because it's small enough, and usually doesn't create pains unless you misuse it
[22:45:59] <imode> jazz: rails came out in 2004, it was trendy for a while.
