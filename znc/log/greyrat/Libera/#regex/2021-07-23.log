[01:26:33] <re101-ainu-62> I have a regex with two capture groups that work, but I want to replace all dashes (-) in my second capture group with spaces. I've tried creating a new group within group2 which can match multiple times, but to no avail. Should be close now, anyone got an idea?https://regex101.com/r/8wsY8t/2/

[16:42:48] <re101-gibbon-10> lol
[16:42:52] <Me-me> That one's harder. Do you want to extract them all individually, or is together okay?
[16:43:31] <re101-gibbon-10> Individual KEY and VALUE.  You can ignore the fact that the same capture group name is repeated.
[16:43:48] <Me-me> Aye. Is there a consistency in how many of those groups there are?
[16:43:56] <Me-me> Those key value pairs?
[16:44:13] <re101-gibbon-10> No, just they KEYS and VALUEs are in the {  }
[16:44:25] <Me-me> Right, so there could be any number of them?
[16:44:28] <re101-gibbon-10> yep

[17:48:47] <digitok> yw
[17:51:30] <Release_> is https://regex101.com/ broken ?
[17:51:44] <Release_> i tried testing there as well yet i get a broken web page

[17:52:57] <Release_> certain not all from what i understood of it
[17:53:46] <digitok> the site's working, but the ssl cert's expired

[17:59:28] *** Joins: newtoliberachat (~xyz@49.206.29.212)
[18:08:09] <Release_> hm tried it few times cant seem to get it working  in ircd
[18:08:24] <Release_>         <clientmatch pattern="(?i)mirc.*\b(?:v7\.(?:6[0-5]|[0-5]\d)|[0-6]\.\d{2})\b"
[18:08:44] <digitok> i thought you might be checking mirc versions
[18:08:50] <Release_> it should detect client version (to detect old mirc versions) 
[18:08:56] <Release_> yes indeed digitok
[18:09:49] <Release_> for now it just sends notice to upgrade
[18:10:00] <Release_> but i cant get the regex to work
[18:10:10] <digitok> what's the string look like
[18:10:28] <Release_> for example there are others like this
[18:10:40] <Release_> <clientmatch pattern="^irssi v(?:0\.|1\.0\.)"
[18:10:45] <Release_> for irssi
[18:11:06] <Release_> but that came with the  configuration of the module
[18:11:21] <Release_> i wanted to create one  for mirc as well
[18:11:26] <digitok> is the string for mirc just "mirc v0.00" ?
[18:12:24] <Release_> mIRC v* Khaled Mardam-Bey
[18:12:33] <Release_> for old versions
[18:12:54] <Release_> thats why  i just used the mirc and version number
[18:13:00] <digitok> yea
[18:13:01] <Release_> to be sure i get them all old and new
[18:13:43] <Release_> as output for new version is different
[18:13:47] <digitok> it'd always be mIRC wouldn't it
[18:13:53] <digitok> ie no need for (?i)
[18:14:08] <Release_> i just wanted to be sure
[18:14:19] <Me-me> MiRc
[18:14:20] <Release_> not  to deal with case issues
[18:14:38] <digitok> it looks like it should work besides a couple of minor things
[18:14:38] *** Quits: ray (~re@user/re) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[18:14:46] <digitok> which version were you testing with
[18:14:56] <Release_> old and new 
[18:15:13] <Me-me> Like, specifically.
[18:15:21] <Release_> 6.21 6.35 and 7.66
[18:15:34] <digitok> right, well none of those would work
[18:15:37] <digitok> "^mIRC v(?:7\.(?:6[0-5]|[0-5]\d)|[0-6]\.\d{2})"
[18:15:38] <digitok> use that
[18:15:41] <Release_> but i dont wanrt to restrict it to these 3
[18:15:51] <Release_> ok will try that
[18:15:59] <digitok> you had "v" directly before "7", so v6 wouldn't match
[18:16:06] <digitok> and it doesn't match 7.66 anyway
[18:16:10] <digitok> so that part's correct
[18:17:11] <Release_> that seemed to work
[18:17:21] <Release_> will test it some more thanks so far digitok
[18:17:32] <digitok> yw so far :)
[18:17:36] <Release_> heh
[18:18:00] <digitok> might aswell update to 7.66 i suppose
[18:18:07] <digitok> apparently 7.65 is old :p
[18:21:02] <Release_> not sure when versions got fixed to work with certain ircds
[18:21:06] <Release_> as that gave some issues
[18:22:44] <digitok> interesting
[18:22:59] <Release_> i used adiirc recently and was impressed
[18:23:35] <Release_> i use that one for testing certs and such
[18:24:09] <Release_> it has a nice stats for certs

[18:25:42] <digitok> it's good, but i still prefer mirc

[18:27:07] <Me-me> I personally just couldn't get around the nagware thing. Sometimes I need it to just open up and work.
[18:27:28] <Release_> same here Me-me
[18:27:34] <Release_> i like light and fast
[18:27:42] <Release_> and accurate most of all ofcourse
[18:27:50] <Me-me> Exactly. And since it makes all my mIRC scripts work anyway - no downside.
