[15:26:41] <serafeim> what's your thinking of elixir usage ? is it increasing or decreasing  ?
[15:26:58] <serafeim> here in Greece i think I'm the only person using elixir :)
[15:27:23] <rawtaz> i'd say its increasing
[15:27:54] <rawtaz> i do not think it has reach mainstream to any relevant extent in terms of job/consulting gigs though, at least not in any of the sources i keep an eye on for that type of work/thing
[15:27:55] <serafeim> really ? interesting
[15:28:12] <serafeim> definitely not it's really niche
[15:28:22] <serafeim> most people don't even know what elixir is
[15:32:16] <rawtaz> yeah :)
[15:32:41] <rawtaz> i mean, it's pretty recently that Go work has been showing a lot more than before, and thats been around for a long time. so it just slow adoption for most companies i guess
[15:36:21] <serafeim> go doesn't really have a good web framework
[15:37:09] <josevalim> serafeim: i think the decrease here is more related to decrease in irc than anything else
[15:37:35] <josevalim> i know a lot of people who gave up on irc for good once the whole freenode thing happened
[15:37:45] <serafeim> josevalim: yes i know. the freenode fiasco was very bad for the community
[15:39:44] <serafeim> at least we got the #elixir chan here (instead of the #elixir-lang on freenode)

[15:46:11] <serafeim> you just need to be a little patient. if you join, ask if anynbody's here and leave after 1 minute then you probably won't get an answer

[15:48:53] <Nicd> Well I'm on Discord more :P
[15:49:29] <rawtaz> sorry you're breaking up, i didnt hear what you said. but never mind :-)
[15:50:39] <rawtaz> if you are using discord you are in fact cheating on us all with rust >_<
[15:50:45] <rawtaz> effectively*
[15:51:14] <whk> well, in south africa it is certainly increasing... i am also hiring .net and ruby devs and converting them ;) but all of them laugh at me when I try to convert them to use irc... its only slack and discord with them. 
[15:51:21] <rawtaz> haha nice!
[15:51:32] <rawtaz> bah, that means they are too young and lame
[15:51:52] <rawtaz> would consider them "sloppy app youth" or something like that. they can never become genuine programmers :P
[15:52:29] <serafeim> whk: i think that only people old enough to have used irc in its glory days (i.e before 2000) would be convinved to use IRC again now
[15:52:43] <rawtaz> that is so sad :/
[15:52:57] <serafeim> or people that are really into the Open Source stuff
[15:53:30] <serafeim> of course people that are way into the Open Source stuff wouldn't ever user IRC because the can't go online 
[15:53:53] <rawtaz> bcause what?
[15:54:04] <serafeim> https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html
[15:54:26] <whk> not sure. it baffles me that irc and xmpp is not more popular. all shine, but less features... its friday, so i might even go on a vscode rant :p 
[15:55:04] <rawtaz> do it. theres a channel for that though (where noone cares) :D
[15:55:41] <whk> there is no one here, so might as well.
[15:55:49] <rawtaz> im all for it :)
[15:56:53] <whk> josevalim uses textmate right? 
[15:57:44] <serafeim> i'm using the vscode. works great. 
[15:58:21] <serafeim> one problem of vscode is that when you search elixir in the plugins it displays an obsolete pklugin first. and some new users may be tricked into installing it 
[15:58:48] <serafeim> it would be great if there was a way to delist that or give it less priority
[15:59:30] <serafeim> i'm refering to this one https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mjmcloug.vscode-elixir
[15:59:56] <whk> i need to install vscode and figure out how to help new .net devs get into elixir. it is actaully causing some frustration amongst the devs here... trying to free up more time to help with tooling, or at least understand the problem
[16:00:26] <serafeim> tell them to make sure to *not* install the plugin i mentioned :)
[16:01:12] <whk> the one with 229119 installs and a 4 star rating? 
[16:01:13] <benwilson512> the one with the most downloads at least is the right one

[16:02:03] <serafeim> benwilson512: yes but for some reason the VScode displays the wrong one first
[16:02:27] <serafeim> also they have a small different in the downloads
[16:03:38] <benwilson512> serafeim: it depends on what you search for. If you search for elixirls it's more obvious. vscode-elixir isn't _wrong_ per se it just doesn't have language server support
[16:03:47] <josevalim> whk: sublime
[16:04:01] <josevalim> i rarely change editors because i barely use them. only when i am forced out

[16:05:15] <serafeim> josevalim: if you don't use editors how you write code? using iex ? 
[16:05:46] <josevalim> sorry, i barely use their features
[16:05:51] <josevalim> i use an editor all the time tho :P
[16:09:12] <Nicd> serafeim: I only started using IRC in 2004
[16:09:22] <Nicd> usercount wise IRC's glory days were in 2005
[16:10:05] <serafeim> well i guess it's different for each person :) for me the irc glory days were when i was able to use the microsoft chat to chat with other comic chat users on the msn network
[16:10:17] <Nicd> hah comic chat
[16:11:43] <whk> biggest problem with emacs is that it takes 3 years to feel okay to use it. i think irc takes some initial learning as well comapred to slack, but in the end offers a bit more. we get used to not having to invest so much time into our tooling.

[17:08:41] <whk> i am not 100% sure. i get complaints about the tooling not working for elixir, but need to investigate. 
[17:10:57] <whk> only issue I have seen myself in screen sharing is the lsp not working, so it might be that they are using the wrong plugin. 
[17:12:45] <whk> also, i moved the tech from nodejs to elixir for most services, so 1) i am sensitive to issues, 2) there is some resistance to change... which can easily be thrown to tooling not working. 
[17:15:17] <rawtaz> whk: honestly, if you are talking about .net devs, thers little hope.. its highly likely that all they know is their lovely microsoft visual studio which pretty much does everything for them, and even that they cant even properly use git. so its not surprising that they complain when its not all automated for them :/
[17:18:30] <whk> might be. our dev community is > 80% .net here. recruiting has a 60% chance of landing yourself with a .net developer, so for growing the community here it does matter.
[17:19:10] <rawtaz> yeah, theres a ton of them. doesnt really help that a lot of schools use .net for their projects as well >_<
[17:21:12] <whk> yeah, it really upsets me. luckily our local university moved to mainly python a couple of years ago. 
[17:21:19] <rawtaz> :)
[17:21:22] <rawtaz> thats better indeed

[21:58:49] <sam_sepi0l> hi
[21:59:05] <sam_sepi0l> how can i get ascci value of a char in elixir?
[21:59:21] <sam_sepi0l> for example in python: ord("a")
[21:59:29] <benwilson512> ?a
[21:59:43] <benwilson512> iex(1)> ?a
[21:59:43] <benwilson512> 97
[21:59:53] <benwilson512> that works for a literal, if you want it dynamic, you have to do something slightly different
[22:00:06] <sam_sepi0l> thank you :) i love elixir
