[14:51:44] <Me-me> No, that pattern (with /g modifier) will work for all of them.
[14:52:37] <re101-mau-74> it does not contain any /g modifier in the expression, can you throw some light?
[14:53:26] <Me-me> The /g modifier indicates that the pattern should match all - this is implemented in different ways depending on what it's being implemented in.

[16:50:48] <digitok> 07rapha, the closest you could do is to create optional groups

[16:51:17] <rapha> digitok: ah, no, that won't work. the number of files is entirely random.
[16:51:50] <digitok> yea, simply splitting the result by , is a cleaner solution if you're able to use code
[16:52:39] <digitok> fyi changing the first .* in your regex to .*? will make it a bit more efficient, and the . at the beginning would ideally be escaped \.

[17:11:32] <Gurkenglas> Why is it called s/replace/with/? if s stands for substitute then you would expect the first argument to be the substitute :(
[17:12:11] <Me-me> Substitute [this] with [that].
[17:12:15] <Me-me> The grammar checks out.
[17:15:18] <Gurkenglas> Hmm. substitute with has ~4 times less google results than substitute for, but I suppose that less horrible than 10^6 times
[17:15:32] <Me-me> Google results do not determine grammar.
[17:15:49] <Me-me> Especially number thereof. That's not how language is determined, whatever XKCD might say.
[17:16:03] <Gurkenglas> usage determines grammar, results measure usage
[17:16:27] <digitok> a hot dog is a sandwich
[17:19:38] <Me-me> Results do not measure usage.
[17:19:48] <Me-me> And usage only sort-of determines grammar.
[17:24:25] <Gurkenglas> you should use a word if people will understand what you mean, aka if they use it the same way. if it were 50/50 then whether it's s/from/to/ or s/to/from/ should of course not me determined by combat between forers and withers, but instead s should be replaced with something that wouldn't confuse half the population ^^
[17:25:12] <Gurkenglas> Why do you believe that google results don't measure usage?
[17:25:34] <Me-me> I am reminded of a man and woman, a horrible father and mother, who kept their son in the house and never told anyone about his existence. They never let him out, never let him talk to anyone or communicate at all outside of the family.
[17:26:03] <Me-me> They never taught him language. As a result, the child learned a series of grunts that his father swore they used to communicate. The father could understand the son and the son could understand the father.
[17:26:32] <Me-me> Now, in this case, putting aside the horrible neglect in other aspects of the boy's life - do you consider that an adequate education in language?
[17:26:51] <Gurkenglas> no, since he cant talk to anyone else
[17:27:28] <Me-me> Then you have contradicted himself. The boy could grunt and his father would understand him. His father could grunt and the boy would understand him. Communication achieved. Therefore, according to you, they "should" use those grunts.
[17:28:03] <Me-me> As for google results, let me check
[17:28:42] <Me-me> Wow, "has anyone ever been so far as to go want to do look more like" sure gets a lot of hits!
[17:29:15] <Me-me> I bet if I said it, people would know what I was referring to, as well. That fits both your criteria for judging language. Must be correct English to use it.
[17:29:32] <Gurkenglas> yeah thats how idioms happen
[17:29:48] <Me-me> That's not an idiom. It's a meme. And importantly, it's a meme about bad language.
[17:30:04] <Me-me> All your base are belong to us probably gets more google hits than "All your bases now belong to us."
[17:30:10] <Me-me> But one is correct and the other is not.
[17:31:21] <digitok> that search gets one result if you do it correctly
[17:31:45] <Me-me> Okay, not counting quotes for either side.
[17:31:48] <digitok> the "has anyone ever..." one, that is
[17:32:06] <Me-me> Well the original, having done the search, is "Has Anyone Really Been Far Even as Decided to Use Even Go Want to do Look More Like?"
[17:32:35] <digitok> now we have 101k results
[17:32:37] <Me-me> The other was from memory.
[17:32:49] <Me-me> Regardless, my point stands.
[17:33:06] <Gurkenglas> Therefore, according to you, they "should" use those grunts. <- If the father is the only one that the son would ever need to talk to, I agree.
[17:33:18] <Me-me> Gross. Well, on that point we disagree.
[17:34:18] <digitok> the way i see it is that a search and replace operation is a substitution, and a substitution is a search and replace operation
[17:34:26] <digitok> and i've never heard of a replace and search tool
[17:34:57] <digitok> hence s/search/replace/ makes perfect sense to me
[17:35:49] <Gurkenglas> yes though i was confused the first few times i saw that syntax, when someone in IRC used it to correct what he said such that which is which wasn't O(1) trivial

[17:37:28] <Gurkenglas> I suppose there's a difference between the number of times that a sentence has been said and the portion of the population that will understand you, and that the latter is what you should use to pick names
[17:37:38] <Me-me> Hey look replace and search gets 642m and search and replace gets 724. I guess they're about equal in usage, digitok.
[17:37:51] <Gurkenglas> And results measure the former, and you understood usage as the latter (right?)
[17:38:10] <Me-me> I still disagree. I'm not wittgenstein.
[17:38:25] <Gurkenglas> you gotta put it in quotes, then one has 1M and the other 7M
[17:38:50] <Me-me> Gosh I wonder how they figured out what words were in use before google.
[17:39:01] <Gurkenglas> Me-me, do you disagree that results measure the number of times that a sentence has been said, or that you understood usage ads the portion of the population that will understand you?
[17:39:26] <Gurkenglas> Presumably they did surveys. T'was a lot of work.

[17:39:42] <Me-me> Do you know the plural of "beef"?
[17:39:59] <Me-me> The word is often used as a material, as in, no plural, no matter how much you have.
[17:40:07] <Gurkenglas> for the meat, i think that works like the plural of water
[17:40:16] <Me-me> But if you find yourself needing to use the plural, say if you have multiple kinds, the word is "beeves".
[17:40:16] <Gurkenglas> yeah, sounds like the usual usage
[17:40:27] <Me-me> This is due to an application of the rules of the word root for beef.
[17:40:34] <Me-me> It is not given in the common usage.
[17:40:54] <Me-me> You sure won't find bloody quantitative google results as a corroborating factor.
[17:41:17] <Gurkenglas> for beef ~= quarrel, i would have guessed beefs, and most would understand me
[17:41:32] <Me-me> And if they had, you would have both been wrong.
[17:41:34] <Me-me> That's my point.
[17:41:47] <Me-me> I could say "sheeps" and be understood. But it would still be wrong.
[17:42:16] <Gurkenglas> My point is that it's not about right or wrong, but about communication. The places to be careful is when you need to prevent boolean blindness
[17:42:39] <Me-me> Communication is served on the macro level when we maintain the principles of a language at the micro level.
[17:43:08] <Me-me> Once we start diverging there's mutation, and that leads to miscommunication, which should be kept to a minimum - again, for the sake of communication.
[17:43:16] <Gurkenglas> like, flammable vs inflammable, that's devastating enough simpsons did the joke
[17:43:41] <Me-me> Not saying it's not unavoidable, but it's like inflation. Sure you accept that there'll be some, you work with it, but also against it, keeping it to a minimum for the sake of the whole.

[17:47:08] <Gurkenglas> i agree that turning words like literally into their opposite is really bad but you can admit the one drift without the other
[17:47:43] <Me-me> That's an entirely separate thing to negative-meaning.

[17:49:51] <Gurkenglas> you mean, people start doing lots of drift for gain that only applies within their bubble, with negative externalities?

[17:52:28] <Gurkenglas> and you're also pointing that though one can communicate across small amounts of drift that only works so long
[17:53:09] <Me-me> That's why I'll fight for "literal" to my dying breath. Because we need it. No matter how many people in the world try to change it - regardless of what to or why. There are no other words like it.
[17:53:41] <Me-me> If I say to someone "You're literally on fire" I don't want them to think I'm complimenting their lucky streak, I want them to start looking around for flames to extinguish.
[17:57:30] <Gurkenglas> oh, that feels like an overreaction fueled by personal instinctive preference for routine. not saying you're wrong, just that this argument wouldn't convert random people to your position, compared to other arguments and positions.
[17:59:29] <Me-me> How fortunate, then, that it was merely a digression from the main point, which is that "replace [object] with [object]" is correct grammar. I don't even know how you would phrase it the other way around.
[17:59:49] <Me-me> "Replace [object] from [object]"?
[18:00:13] <Me-me> Substitute [object] with [object] - good. Substitute [object] from [object] - bad.
[18:00:21] <Gurkenglas> yeah, r/asd/dsa/ makes sense - that one never sees the other direction. substitute is the slightly ambiguous one
[18:00:37] <Me-me> Neither sees the other direction.
[18:01:02] <Me-me> Both replace and substitute are the same kind of verb.
[18:01:09] <Me-me> If it worked with substitute it would work with replace.
[18:03:09] <Gurkenglas> substitute a for b sees usage - i suspect i learned the word in the context of logic, where it may be useful to have it implied that the first argument is the substitute
[18:03:46] <Me-me> Formal logic (roughly a century old) uses different grammar than English. I suspect it might be based in Latin? I don't remember. Point is, they're distinct.
[18:04:34] <Gurkenglas> "the coach substituted the rookie for the star quarter back to give him some experience on the field" havent you heard something like this?
[18:04:38] <Me-me> Similarly, Japanese, Thai, German - they can all have different grammar systems too. If their equivalent to substitute does it differently, that's also fine. But s// was designed by an English speaker.

[18:06:03] <Me-me> ... Hrm. I might have. I still believe replace with is correct.
[18:06:14] <Me-me> Substitute with, I mean.
[18:06:47] <Gurkenglas> just like we should prevent far-enough language drift to get misunderstandings, langauges ought to merge - except that i guess the communication difficulties would go from expected to surprising in the process

[19:13:47] *** Joins: fedorafan (~fedorafan@user/fedorafan)
[19:16:22] <digitok> pretty much. generally, quote strings interpret their own escape sequences, such as \n be evaluated as a newline, or \" being a double quote
