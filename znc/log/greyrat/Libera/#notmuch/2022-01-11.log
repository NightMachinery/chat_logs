[14:03:14] <bremner> colemickens: I'd suggest sending a mail to the list, that (in response to your comment on github) is how bugs are reported.
[14:04:26] <bremner> I don't have convenient access to gnupg 2.3.3, but I guess the arch linux people will hit this as well
[14:21:35] <gour> it seems that author of vdir.el uses notmuch. anyone using vdir.el for contacts?
[14:40:27] <bremner> no, but it looks interesting
[14:43:34] * gour wants to solve calendars/contacts syncing without the need to use either evolution or thunderbird just for that purpose...maybe, only vdirsyncer/khal/khard and then vdir.el with notmuch
[16:52:40] <bremner> oh, maybe arch is also still shipping gnupg 2.2.x

[22:47:37] <lelit> hi, is there any shortcut to perform a search like "notmuch search from:myself", where "myself" means any of user.primary_email+user.other_email ?
[22:48:22] <lelit> the goal would be tagging those messages with "sent"...
[22:48:23] <bremner> lelit: not built in, but you can define a query
[22:49:48] <lelit> ok, it seemed a reasonable feature :)

[23:18:53] <SebTM> yeah gpg (GnuPG) 2.3.3
[23:18:59] <SebTM> trying to build it on nixos
[23:19:31] <bremner> right. So it's known (as of yesterday). There's a quick fix patch on the mailing list, but I want to do a bit better
[23:19:54] <bremner> SebTM: someone from nixos was here yesterday.

[23:20:24] <bremner> whatever "from nixos" means, of course
[23:21:42] <SebTM> Ah thx someone reported that between I was sleeping :D I'm on the unstable channel which means if the binary cache does not have a build of the version from our repoisitories my client will build it with the local versions :)
[23:46:39] <SebTM> thx fixed and changes are already in master so should be in the other channels soon :)
