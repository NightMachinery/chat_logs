[00:04:45] <MetaNova> literally or figuratively?
[00:10:15] <CuriosTiger> In the singular, it's usually figurative. It means a tough, hardworking person. Someone who isn't afraid to get their hands dirty and doesn't let obstacles or setbacks stop them.
[00:13:15] <tinwhiskers> I think that definition nicely covers off the nuances of having grit.

[01:01:25] <StayHungry> babyface: If you have grit, you'll keep trying to climb a rock wall no matter how many times you slip and fall. Charles Portis's 1968 novel "True Grit" tells the story of a young girl in the 1800s who embodies this quality, persevering through extreme difficulty and struggle.

[16:59:44] <StayHungry> Spain, at the time of its arrogant attitude towards the world, wiped out South American culture. But at least those Spaniards had achievements that made them more worthy in their own eyes. Today's rabid youth encroaches on their own culture, but they hardly held something heavier than a smartphone or a mug of beer in their hands. Living in a unique time of protracted prosperity without huge upheavals, they take culture for granted, 
[16:59:44] <StayHungry> and not as a fragile layer on top of chaos.
[17:00:49] <StayHungry> You ask, who is the king and who are the members of the language academy, and I will ask, and who are you? Those people at least dedicated their lives, talents and zeal to study and preservation, and what did the rebels do, daring to talk about the structure of society through their lips? Seems they have only read the charter on the right of everyone to speak freely but irresponsibly.

[19:37:00] <lall-> there's this food thing that scientists use to make animals fat, it's basically combination of high fat high carb combined foods, and low protein.
[19:37:20] <twb> lall-: why would scientists do that
[19:37:30] <lall-> which is what most of modern american diet is .
[19:37:42] <lall-> to research nutrition
[19:37:54] <lall-> i can't remember the exact name of these things
[19:38:08] <lall-> but it's basically all fat and carbs
[19:38:26] <lall-> because, the carbs stop the body from using fats as energy, and you end up storing fat 
[19:38:39] <lall-> so if you combine the two, you get ...well.. donuts.
[19:39:36] <lall-> that's why keto is so effective at making people lose weight, because you get your body to burn fat instead of carbs for energy.
[19:41:00] <blkshp> Exactly. If i have a donut, I make sure i eat some ham too :D
[19:42:17] <lall-> Good. Eating just energy rich foods does not satisfy humans, so we eat until we stuff ourselves with it and we can't eat anymore. Eating protein raises satiety levels, so you end up eating less energy because you feel full earlier.
[19:42:29] <lall-> though... "ham" ... that's questionable :)
[19:43:16] <blkshp> When I say ham I mean proper ham.
[19:43:27] * blkshp never feels full.
[19:43:29] <huf> or you can just eat less

[19:45:55] <lall-> though protein gets converted to sugars also in your liver, if you overeat.
[19:53:17] <lall-> And interesting factoid, (at least to me) that the only food that's rich in both carbs and fats in nature is peanuts. Other foods, either carbs or fats, but not both. So, the fast food industry is using this against people to sell their products because it short circuits the brain into overeating

[19:55:00] <lall-> guess it's boiled
[19:55:13] <twb> Can't you just buy some peanuts and boil them?
[19:55:40] <lall-> there's also steam peanuts
[19:55:43] <blkshp> I don't know, i have seen them many times on the telly-box but never really looked into it.

[19:59:39] <tinsoldier> Slate is a fine-grained, foliated, homogeneous metamorphic rock derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade regional metamorphism. It is the finest grained foliated metamorphic rock.

It is caused by strong compression causing fine grained clay flakes to regrow in planes perpendicular to the compression.

[20:37:42] <bin> they've been around since the 30s

[20:37:52] <bin> I wish I was making that up
[20:38:00] <blkshp> oh
[20:38:01] <lall-> I thought they were called soap operas because of the ads in between to sell soap

[20:38:13] <LuisP14> hahaha
[20:38:16] <bin> lall-: yep because they were done by proctor & gamble
[20:38:21] <lall-> yeah.
[20:38:27] <bin> they started on the radio and then moved to television
[20:38:52] <bin> i read something about this a while ago
[20:39:00] <bin> such a random fact to maintain inside my head
[20:39:10] <bin> here it is https://medium.com/knowledge-stew/why-are-daytime-dramas-called-soap-operas-ee052d9edf17
[20:40:00] <lall-> i watched bunch of them in late 90s. But there's the one that everybody watched, called Santa Barbara, that one was from early 80s and had like 2000 episodes 
[20:40:04] <bin> nice
[20:40:17] <bin> i never really watched them. days of our lives is still going
[20:40:23] <bin> i think
[20:40:23] * LuisP14 gambles his way around the proctor
[20:40:40] <huf> we have one like that here

[20:40:57] <huf> so that wasnt fun, growing up
[20:41:00] <bin> there was this afternoon show I loved as a kid called "Rescue 911"
[20:41:04] <bin> Did you ever watch that lall-?
[20:41:27] <lall-> i missed out on buying soap though.
[20:41:28] <bin> blkshp: interesting that people still listen to it
[20:41:40] <huf> probably the same people
[20:41:47] <bin> if they're still alive, I guess
[20:41:52] <huf> only been 70 years :D
[20:42:25] <blkshp> lol
[20:42:36] <bin> I mean if they were 50 in 1950 they're prob not here today :P
[20:42:37] <lall-> rescue 911 i watched, because it was on TV, but that was not a soap opera as far as i remember. that was reality TV
[20:42:46] <bin> lall-: yeah
[20:42:49] <bin> it was not a soap opera
[20:43:00] <bin> but it was one of those re-enactment drama reality shows
[20:43:07] <bin> oh and unsolved mysteries too
[20:43:18] <lall-> yeah, i'm 37, so i watched all of these 90s shows...and late 80s. 
[20:43:31] <lall-> There was one with Dan Akroyd that I liked,some mystery stuff
[20:43:43] <blkshp> ooh... bin, you like British crime stuff... ever watched "Waking the dead"?
[20:45:36] <lall-> British crime...look no further than Poirot :) Well, the British Sherlock holmes too, the one from the 80s. Brits do crime so good.
[20:46:16] <bin> I've wathced all of Poirot and also Frost

[20:47:06] <blkshp> Watch the pilot and then episode 1, the pilot could be better but the series itself is excellent. 
[20:47:25] <huf> poirot is great
[20:47:30] <huf> they had that on our tv when I was a kid

[20:50:04] <bin> midsommer murders is my favorite
[20:50:06] <lall-> Watched it StayHungry. But not because I liked it, just because it was on TV.

[20:55:12] <blkshp> We have to be good at something ;)
[20:55:54] <StayHungry> blkshp: why is there no gasoline at the gas stations?
[20:56:01] <lall-> I heard a story that after WW2 there was a thing started... to kickstart cultural stuff. Schools, and such. Eric Claptopn, and many musicians attended these places
[20:56:08] <blkshp> Because we don't have gasoline or gas stations.
[20:56:11] <lall-> but I can't remember the details, or if it's true.
[20:56:23] <StayHungry> blkshp: err… what :D
[20:56:23] <lall-> basically, kickstaring all aspects of art
[20:56:50] <blkshp> We have fuel (petrol or diesel) at petrol or fuel stations. The term "gas" doesn't exist
[20:57:13] * StayHungry looks up the dictionaries
[20:57:15] <lall-> Term gas is fckn dumb anyway.
[20:57:33] <blkshp> But, someone in the media reported a shortage and people went mad and panic bought like with toilet roll.
[20:57:33] <lall-> since petrol is not gaseous
[20:57:58] <blkshp> Gasoline is the term we don't have so therefore we don't have it's contraction. "gas" refers to natural gas here.
[20:58:23] <lall-> "Gas" refers to natural gas everywhere, it's just that some countries hijacked the term
[20:58:40] <mdogg> Technically, the term "gas" refers to something in it's 3rd state of matter, as opposed to being a solid or a liquid.  
[20:58:42] <blkshp> Yes, but primarily
[20:58:45] <lall-> well, it refers to gaseous matter
[20:59:13] *** Quits: SkunkyLaptop (~skunky@user/skunky) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:59:48] <lall-> Petrol is liquid though, not gas. So how people started calling petrol, gas... no idea
[21:00:01] <LuisP14> surely turns to gas if left out :3
[21:00:02] <blkshp> Because it's short for gasoline
[21:00:16] <blkshp> gas and gas are different words.
[21:00:20] <mdogg> Yeah.  But that's just an American term.  It might be north American but I'm not sure.
[21:00:39] <lall-> Gas and Gas are different?

[21:01:14] <lall-> yeah but that's arbitrary
[21:01:41] <lall-> because somebody chose to call it "gas", not because there's historical context behind calling gas petroleum fuel

[21:04:25] <mdogg> It's not really that confusing.  People just have a different words for some things is all.
[21:04:55] <lall-> That link StayHungry pasted is confusing.
[21:04:55] <blkshp> quite.
[21:05:11] <mdogg> For example, in the U.K. and Ireland, they call the "trunk" of the car the "boot", and they call the "hood" the "bonnet".  
[21:05:13] <lall-> I refuse to understand it.
[21:05:29] <blkshp> Precisely. Makes more sense that way anyway ;)
[21:06:14] <lall-> trunk > a person's or animal's body apart from the limbs and head.
[21:06:22] * LuisP14 puts on a boot and boots(2 senses) his car by the boot
[21:06:30] <lall-> trunk > the main woody stem of a tree as distinct from its branches and roots.
[21:07:04] <lall-> Maybe they kept boots in there historically so it's called boot.
[21:07:06] <LuisP14> trunk > the buttocks ... junk in da trunk

[21:07:42] <twb> I was gonna say "just call it naphtha"
[21:07:47] <twb> Which in fact they do in .ar
[21:08:13] <lall-> nafta?
[21:08:19] <twb> lall-: greek fire
[21:08:34] <lall-> Nafta in Serbian is Diesel.
[21:08:47] <blkshp> but you didder nafta.
[21:08:58] <lall-> ph == f
[21:09:04] <twb> lall-: is petrol/gas called "benzene" ?
[21:09:14] <lall-> yep. Benzin.
[21:09:18] <twb> cool
[21:10:53] <lall-> Most poeple put red diesel in their cars. Red diesel is basically diesel for farm vehicles without tax.
[21:11:06] <lall-> So golf mark 2, red diesel... and off you go.
[21:12:39] <pussipupu> The red is dye to show that you used untaxed fuel

[21:13:05] <pussipupu> Leasure boat diesel was red diesel in the UK until a couple of years back too
[21:13:10] <lall-> yeah.
[21:13:30] <pussipupu> (Untaxed diesels are also died a variety of other colours, at least blue and green but same basic idea)
[21:13:49] <pussipupu> Diesel is also a name for snakebite and black, because it's a similar red
[21:13:55] <pussipupu> yummy
[21:14:01] <lall-> Yeah, but people used to put that in their cars. It was illegal, but who's gonan check
[21:14:43] <pussipupu> That and home made biodiesel from chip fat

[21:14:58] <pussipupu> Though at least one person got caught doing that because there was a fishy smell..
[21:16:06] <lall-> I got done one time for having "dirty plates", the cops couldn't find anything wrong with me or my car,and they wrote a fine for dirty plates instead. If they want to find something, they will... but generally no copper sniffs the gas tank for fishy smells.
[21:16:42] <pussipupu> IIRC it was stinking up the town
[21:16:48] <pussipupu> So probably someone complained

[22:05:12] <blkshp> Hello awmv
[22:05:29] <awmv> Ah hi
[22:05:38] <blkshp> New to IRC are you ;)
[22:05:44] <blkshp> s/you/you?
[22:05:44] <chat> blkshp meant to say: New to IRC are you? ;)
[22:05:51] <awmv> Yeah, in some ways :)
[22:06:03] <blkshp> wilkommen.
[22:07:26] <awmv> Mind giving me feedback on a sentence I feel uncomfortable about?
[22:07:33] <awmv> It's this one: Is there gonna be a similar position with fewer requirements in terms of seniority available for the Climate Risk Center Tech team?
[22:07:51] <blkshp> "gonna"
[22:08:05] <awmv> going to?
[22:08:17] <blkshp> better.
[22:08:36] <blkshp> though might i suggest "Will there be any similart positions..."
[22:08:41] <blkshp> s/art/ar
[22:08:41] <chat> blkshp meant to say: though might i suggest "Will there be any similar positions..."
[22:10:02] <awmv> So like that? Will there be any similar position with fewer requirements in terms of seniority for the Climate Risk Center Tech team available?
[22:10:47] <awmv> I feel like I'm missing commas 
[22:10:53] <blkshp> positions*
[22:11:02] <awmv> Good catch
[22:11:24] <blkshp> It's a little long but I don't think a comma is needed.
[22:11:38] <blkshp> you could omit "available"
[22:11:45] <mdogg> I would say "...in the future." reather than "...available"
[22:12:01] <mdogg> Or as blkshp suggested, just omit the word completely.
[22:12:32] <lall-> Would there be any positions available in the future with fewer requirements in terms of seniority within the Climate Risk Center Tech team?
[22:12:51] <lall-> but something bothers me about this sentence though.
[22:13:21] <lall-> anyway, if I used "available" i would word it like this.
[22:14:48] <awmv> Thank you for the feedback :)

[22:32:28] <StayHungry> lall-: what about documentaries for a change? :) perhaps by Adam Curtis?
[22:33:57] <StayHungry> or something by David Attenborough, e.g. recent 'a perfect planet'
[22:34:00] <lall-> Sir. I only watch Atttenborough documentaries.
[22:34:10] <lall-> Or... Jeremy Clarkson ones.

[22:35:14] <nasal_spray> hello, i'm being a bit OCD over a birthday note for a colleague, can someone proofread?
[22:35:20] <lall-> it's called "Century of self", and it's on youtube. The subject was how early psychology was used for marketing and consumerism

[22:35:47] <StayHungry> lall-: yes, seen that

[22:38:24] <StayHungry> nasal_spray: it's gonna be ok :)
[22:38:26] <lall-> you mean, you considered saying weekends, dash, start?
[22:38:32] <lall-> stick with weekend's start.
[22:39:20] <lall-> otherwise, people might say you're JP.
[22:39:24] <nasal_spray> ok, i'll stick with the latter
[22:39:28] <nasal_spray> what's jp?
[22:39:39] <StayHungry> yeah, define JP :)
