[00:09:32] <Kingsy> so I have a .mkv file and a .pgs subtitle file. hwo can I embed the subs in the mkv? I usually so it with -vf "subtitles=subs.srt" but that doesnt work in this case.
[00:09:59] <furq> if you want to hardsub then use the overlay filter
[00:10:16] <JEEB> and image based subtitles can just be handled as another option
[00:10:19] <JEEB> input I mean
[00:10:36] <JEEB> since only text based subs do not have sub2video :)
[00:11:10] <Kingsy> hrm can I see an example?
[00:12:53] <JEEB> http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#Examples-103 something like this?
[00:13:51] <Kingsy> hm I still don't understand. it doesnt take a file

[00:54:23] <Kingsy> well I thought lossy compression was the act of just attempting to reduce filesize and a byproduct for that reduction is a loss in quality.
[00:55:12] <BtbN> The only way to keep it the same is to use a lossless encode/codec
[00:55:20] <BtbN> Any kind of lossy compression will degrade quality

[01:07:58] <Kingsy> agreed. but I thought the lack of encoding options meant that ffmpeg would just leave the video stream unmodified? therefore the filesize etc would be the same.

[01:09:48] <kepstin> no, by default ffmpeg will re-encode video. you need to use the "-c copy" option to make it copy video without re-encoding.
[01:11:13] <another|> note: you can't stream copy with filters

[06:35:55] <klaxa> Lebela_: the best idea i can come up with is using something like clahe (https://towardsdatascience.com/clahe-and-thresholding-in-python-3bf690303e40) to adjust brightness for every frame, but i don't know if it would look bad, also it would need a lot of storage because i think there is no filter for that in ffmpeg (yet) and you'd write all the frames to disk and then write a new file from those frames

[06:50:25] <Lebela_> klaxa, I have one more idea, but it's half-baked
[06:50:55] <Lebela_> klaxa, the video has 30 fps.  The problems aren't happening exactly at full seconds, but in between.
[06:51:08] <Lebela_> e.g.  frame 127 - 132
[06:51:31] <Lebela_> before frame 127, the brightness is the same (dark)
[06:51:39] <Lebela_> and after frame 132 the brightness is the same (bright)
[06:51:56] <Lebela_> so, I could easily adjust frame 132+ to be darker  or  everything under 127 to be brighter
[06:52:07] <Lebela_> the problem are the frames 127 - 132 which show a gradual change
[06:52:16] <Lebela_> can I somehow drop these frames?
[06:52:28] <Lebela_> and make ffmpeg "fill them up" with other frames?
[06:52:39] <klaxa> you could maybe try using some non-linear video editor to adjust those frames
[06:53:01] <klaxa> hmmm there is also a frame select filter i think? you could skip those frames and ffmpeg should duplicated previous frames
[06:53:07] <Lebela_> what is a non-linear video editor?
[06:53:33] <klaxa> stuff like windows movie maker or sony vegas
[06:53:39] <Lebela_> I am on Linux

[09:26:49] <twb> Can ffmpeg read directly from rtp://239.255.1.2:1234/ ?  It seems like it should be able to, but this code is doing multicat raw.ts and then ffmpeg -i raw.ts compressed.td
[09:26:52] <twb> * .ts
[09:30:34] <twb> Oh, I see.  They're running multicat so they can pass a "stop recording after x seconds"
[09:31:00] <twb> That seems like something ffmpeg could also do.  Maybe they were also concerned about the ability to downsample in real time.

[09:56:53] <twb> essentially for a few years Debian called ffmpeg "avconv" because of license bullshit

[18:23:02] <Kadigan> Hey. Is there a way to tell ffmpeg to use "same settings as source" for the video codec?
[18:23:40] <BtbN> no
[18:23:51] <durandal_1707> no, as that makes no sense when transcoding
[18:24:21] <Eternam> But what if I just want to rewrap?
[18:24:39] <BtbN> don't re-encode then
[18:24:42] <Kadigan> durandal_1707: not sure what you mean it makes no sense.
[18:24:52] <Kadigan> I need to apply an overlay, but don't want to change the format at all otherwise.
[18:25:02] *** Quits: epony (epony@user/epony) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[18:25:05] <BtbN> If you re-encode, you're bound to do so. No way around it.
[18:25:15] <Kadigan> No, I'm not.
[18:25:34] <BtbN> Even if you encode something with x264, decode it, and encode it again with x264, exact same settings, the result will be different, worse in quality
[18:25:39] <Kadigan> I can go from Prores 422 to Prores 422, mov to mov. All I need is to add an overlay.
[18:25:40] <BtbN> so "use same settings" is meaningless
[18:25:58] *** Quits: someuser (~user@197.54.121.144) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[18:26:16] <Kadigan> For those codecs, it's not.
[18:27:00] <BtbN> "those codecs"?
[18:27:03] <durandal_1707> for prores >8bit depth it may be fine if you know how to do it
[18:28:37] <Kadigan> durandal_1707: but still, not having an option to do it still means I can't just tell it "oh, just reuse the codec and settings", I have to be explicit... Ah, well.
[18:29:00] <BtbN> "reuse codec settings" really is meaningless
[18:29:01] <durandal_1707> what encoder?
[18:29:12] <BtbN> Besides, where should it magically pull those settings from?
[18:29:12] <Kadigan> I mean, I know what codec I'm working with, I just wanted to have something for the various flavours. I guess I can make a few separate scripts, is all.
[18:29:41] <durandal_1707> if you created file with some intermediate encoder, just use same setting again
[18:30:38] <Kadigan> BtbN: from the existing source file? Prores only really takes one parameter - the level (unless you're doing alpha, but even then the settings are simple enough).
[18:31:23] <BtbN> That'd assuming they're somehow persisted into the bitstream or container. Which is not the case generally
[18:31:33] <Kadigan> durandal_1707: yeah, which is what I'll do (obviously). Except if I used LT, I don't want to repackage them to HQ (which will waste 60% of the bitrate).
[18:31:55] <BtbN> some encoders do dump a settings-info bit, like x264 for example, but it's not in a useful format, and using the exact same options again will not yield the same results anyway, so it's meaningless, again
[18:31:59] <durandal_1707> Kadigan: if you are not using ffmpeg prores encoders than I'm sorry
[18:32:10] <Kadigan> BtbN: with Prores, it technically should be... unless the "vendor" flag is ignored (apcn, apch... etc.)
[18:32:30] <Kadigan> durandal_1707: not sure what you're in reference to, there
[18:32:58] <durandal_1707> encoders have different settings/options, not just single one
[18:33:14] <Kadigan> Prores really has just the one. :D
[18:33:37] <durandal_1707> not here
[18:34:25] <Kadigan> ... holy crap, you're right
[18:35:43] <durandal_1707> if your final output/export is 8bit it may be okish
[18:36:19] <Kadigan> No, no, it's fine - I had *no clue* that there were so many Prores settings in ffmpeg.
[18:37:06] <Kadigan> I'm confused now, to be honest... If I recall right, Apple was kinda very specific about how the codec should work, so all of these options sound like something I could very easily break my files with. But eh, outside the scope.
[18:37:19] <Kadigan> Thanks!

[19:32:38] <mindfreeze>  I am thinking how accurate can the segment filter can be over ffms2/lsmash when trying to segment a raw video file(y4m file), on my limited testing it was giving frame-accurate results, but not entirely sure if there can be corner cases,  can anyone please clarify regarding this.
[19:33:38] <durandal_1707> y4m should works for radnom frame number seek always
