[00:24:48] <DNH> I am not implementing hash maps but I am rather getting data from a data provider and I need to assign a unique identifier to each element so I know that I processed that element already when I recall the api endpoint

[11:01:50] <serafeim> pl o
[11:02:00] <serafeim> ok i've got this string datetime: `"2022-03-02T18:36:59.422538"`. i know this is in UTC
[11:02:06] <serafeim> i now want to convert it to elxiir datetime
[11:02:19] <serafeim> trying this `DateTime.from_iso8601("2022-03-02T18:36:59.422538")` gets me `{:error, :missing_offset}`
[11:02:57] <serafeim> Can I add a "Z" in the end and be done with it ? i.e do a `DateTime.from_iso8601("2022-03-02T18:36:59.422538Z")` (this returns `{:ok, ~U[2022-03-02 18:36:59.422538Z], 0}`). am i missing something ?
[11:04:09] <penguinbrian> Going from memory, I think you need to use NaiveDateTime not DateTime because you don't have the timezone. You can then convert it to a DateTime value if you have an appropriate timezone.
[11:04:23] <serafeim> the next step for me is to insert that datetime to a database in a utc_datetime_usec
[11:04:48] <serafeim> penguinbrian: but i know that it's in UTC so won't it be fine if I add the "Z" myself ? 
[11:04:48] <Nicd> yep NaiveDateTime.from_iso8601 and then DateTime.from_naive
[11:05:03] <Nicd> you can do that too
[11:05:04] <serafeim> why make my life more difficult ? 
[11:05:08] <serafeim> cool thanks
[11:05:15] <Nicd> I wouldn't say two function calls is difficult
[11:06:29] <serafeim> it's the same; `NaiveDateTime.from_iso8601("2022-03-02T18:36:59.422538") |> elem(1) |> DateTime.from_naive("Etc/UTC") |> elem(1) ==  DateTime.from_iso8601("2022-03-02T18:36:59.422538Z")|> elem(1)` returns true
[11:06:53] <Nicd> as it should
[11:06:57] <serafeim> yea
[11:07:00] <serafeim> thanks
[11:10:03] <serafeim> how can i change my integer to big int in an ecto schema and ectyo migration ?
[11:11:10] <Nicd> schemas don't have bigints
[11:11:57] <Nicd> in a migration you need to alter the table and modify the field to have type `:bigint` or `:bigserial` or whatever you want
[11:12:08] <serafeim> thanks i'll fix my migration

[13:31:39] <josevalim> thing in things is a valid guard, that would be ambiguous
[13:33:58] <serafeim> thanks i understand
[13:34:12] <serafeim> thanks i understand

[13:35:12] <Nicd> nah a separate compiler or something
[13:35:34] <serafeim> lol
[13:35:58] <serafeim> uh oh i'm getting this error: `[error] Postgrex.Protocol (#PID<0.531.0>) disconnected: ** (DBConnection.ConnectionError) client #PID<0.93.0> timed out because it queued and checked out the connection for longer than 15000ms`
[13:36:13] <serafeim> this probably is related to running a long operation (multiple inserts) inside a transaction
[13:36:18] <serafeim> anyway i can increase the timeout ?
[13:36:33] <josevalim> yes, there is a timeout option on the transaction and repo operations
[13:36:42] <josevalim> you can also increase it in the configuration
[13:37:00] <serafeim> ah yes thank you https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Repo.html#module-shared-options
[13:37:08] <serafeim> no i think this is needed only for this operation

[14:27:54] <m1dnight> Does anyone have some pointers to manually writing an erlang history file?
[14:28:29] <m1dnight> I'm debugging with distributed erlang, and I would like to spawn nodes with a given nane, and prepolulate the file history with a single command
[14:28:36] <m1dnight> that way I can do arrow up enter  and go from there
[14:28:47] <m1dnight> the file is not plain text, so it seems
[14:30:43] <Nicd> where is the history file?
[14:31:08] <m1dnight> You can set it with an environment variable:
[14:31:29] <m1dnight> export ELIXIR_ERL_OPTIONS="-kernel shell_history_path '/tmp/history_${1}'" ; iex --sname ${1} --cookie "secret" -S mix
[14:32:33] <Nicd> I know, I'm wondering where the default is
[14:32:54] <m1dnight> oh, that's in the root directory 
[14:33:08] <m1dnight> I guess the directory where you spawn the shell, that is.
[14:33:40] <Nicd> doesn't seem to be there

[14:43:36] <Nicd> try `:disk_log.info(:"$#group_history")`
[14:43:47] <Nicd> maybe you can use `:disk_log` functions to write to that log
[14:50:13] <Nicd> oh yes, when I use `:disk_log.log(:"$#group_history", 'I just input something here')` then it writes that into the history, except the last character is lost for some reason :)
[14:50:27] <Nicd> (note the charlist, when I used a string it blew up my IEx when loading that from history)
[14:50:55] <Nicd> also I had to use `System.stop()` instead of C-c C-c to make it stick for some reason

[18:12:03] <wink> I am looking at the (generated) version of a phoenix runtime.exs and I notice the (I guess common) practice of using the 'url' via DATABASE_URL - is there anything that speaks against changing this to single env vars, because I am using jamdb_oracle and it looks like a certain 'hammer-nail' problem. I have extra params, port etc.pp and would have to trial-error my way to the correct url anyway
[18:12:54] <wink> TLDR version: runtime.exs looks understandable enough. you can inject any amount of info via ENV, right? no "dont do this it will eat your dog"
