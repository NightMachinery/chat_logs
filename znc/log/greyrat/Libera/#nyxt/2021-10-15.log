[13:31:24] <Kabouik> Speaking of logging in, one thing that drives me mad in Nyxt (together with the issue with history-backwards) is how often if forgets about login status. I think it's a Webkit "smart" feature as we discussed here some months ago and perhaps it's influenced by changing IPs, but it's literally several times a day for me

[19:01:22] <hendursaga> What's the FotD?
[19:34:31] <jmercouris> amk: that’s a problem with GitHub
[19:34:53] <jmercouris> amk: the good news is that the makefile forces download of the submodules
[19:40:24] <amk> Ah for some reason im getting `alexandria not found` error when i make all, i wonder if its because .git isnt included in the tarball
[20:20:20] <jmercouris> amk: perhaps, the best bet is to just clone things
[20:20:56] <hendursaga> jmercouris: changelog says "- Remove =object-string= and =object=display=, now superseded by =attributes-default= and =object-attributes=." but object-string is still defined and used.. is it just deprecated?

[20:25:31] <hendursaga> also for object-attributes I'm seeing a lot of (str:shorten 80 ...) - what happens when you don't do that and it's over 80 chars? does it still get trimmed or what?
[20:29:51] <jmercouris> hendursaga: it still gets trimmed by the renderer
[20:30:09] <hendursaga> so why do it explicitly then? faster performance?
[20:36:13] <hendursaga> or more consistent truncating?
[20:36:41] <jmercouris> For faster performance
[20:36:45] <jmercouris> That’s the reason
[20:37:03] <jmercouris> Now does it make sense to shorten strings to 80? I don’t know
[20:42:01] <hendursaga> It's tradition!
[20:45:30] <jmercouris> Lol
[20:45:34] <jmercouris> I did test it
[20:45:43] <jmercouris> It isn’t JUST tradition
[20:47:15] <dije> Hi all
[20:47:29] <dije> Lots of questions and issues I've been saving for the weekend
[20:47:46] <dije> Where to start, where to start
[20:48:32] <dije> OK, protocol handlers. All I can find is an issue which provides one very old snippet that (I've just been told) is for 1.x only
[20:49:18] <dije> So, how do I set up handlers for mailto:/file:/magnet: etc?
[20:52:04] <hendursaga> dije: we don't do piracy here :P
[20:55:34] <dije> No protocol handlers then. Funny, they were supported in 1.x. OK, next: is there a Nyxt wiki yet?
[20:56:07] *** Joins: waleee (~waleee@2001:9b0:216:8200:d457:9189:7843:1dbd)
[20:57:30] <dije> @waleee Maybe you know: I was just asking about how to implement protocol handlers in Nyxt.
[21:00:51] <hendursaga> dije: I was just teasing you, although I would like to know the answer
[21:00:56] <hendursaga> We do have a forum, but no wiki, as of yet
[21:02:06] <waleee> dije: org protocols? No idea
[21:02:58] <hendursaga> waleee: no, he meant like mailto: etc
[21:03:04] <hendursaga> URL protocols
[21:03:22] <waleee> ah. The cluelessness expands then
[21:04:54] <dije> but... but... @waleee: my fount of knowledge!
[21:06:26] <dije> In Conkeror, it's a single line of JS in your rc: set_protocol_handler("mailto:", "/path/to/my_handler_script");
[21:08:41] <waleee> I'm somewhat confident something exists for/in webkit, but that you need some plumbing for it
[21:08:50] <waleee> *for it
[21:10:32] <hendursaga> oh, toggle-attributes-display is new (to me)
[21:12:00] <waleee> I think ambrevar and aartaka has some notmuch stuff in their configs but that's about it re mails
[21:12:37] <waleee> strike aartaka, just ambrevar/pierre
[21:14:22] <aartaka> waleee: Yeah :)
[21:14:31] <waleee> hm not in his either. Where did I see that
[21:17:04] <aartaka> waleee: cl-webkit has `webkit-web-context-register-uri-scheme-callback` based on `webkit_web_context_register_uri_scheme`, so yeah, there is a way. It's just that we haven't made a good abstraction for it yet.
[21:19:38] <aartaka> dije: what Ambrevar meant on GitHub was that you should replace the `%slot-default` in your email snippet with `%slot-default%` (note the percent at the end). The code should work perfectly fine in the current version otherwise.
[21:20:47] <waleee> aartaka: whilst your at the irc screen, the test suite for cl-webkit should work from a sbcl repl right?
[21:20:49] <aartaka> dije: If it doesn't (I'll be really surprised), you can ask for help there or on GitHub :)
[21:20:58] <waleee> * work = pass
[21:22:08] <aartaka> waleeee: I'm not sure, as there are lots of wariables and the last time I checked, the best results I got was that the tests passed and it silently waited. I needed to manually interrupt it. Haven't figured it until now :/
[21:22:27] <aartaka> s/figured it/figured it out
[21:22:40] <aartaka> *variables
[21:23:10] <hendursaga> I just use Emacs for my notmuch client, it's the best :)
[21:23:29] <aartaka> The waiting issue is most probably due to GTK main loop waiting.
[21:24:04] <waleee> aartaka: but it shouldn't eg crash when initalizing WebKitWebsiteDatamanager at least?
[21:24:17] <aartaka> waleee: 0_o
[21:24:20] <waleee> * class name might be wrong
[21:24:32] <aartaka> waleee: No, it shouldn't!
[21:24:49] <waleee> I will re run it and pastebin the error
[21:25:19] <aartaka> Yay, tests flagging regressions!
[21:26:27] <waleee> I decided to check if they passed when investigating & reproducing crashes in nyxt on set-url
[21:28:00] <aartaka> waleee: If you reproduce, post it on Github so that it's not flushed away by IRC flows. Pierre might be interested in the error too. I'm having a tough studying week, so not much help from me (:
[21:28:48] <waleee> intresting. I wonder if the package update I just did on my system has rectified something, now the test suite doesn't seem to crash
[21:29:16] <waleee> just taking forever on the 1st test that actually uses webkit
[21:30:35] <aartaka> waleee: WebKit people are delegating more and more stuff to DataManager and changing things around it. That could be the reason.

[23:04:07] <hendursaga> definitely paste it somewhere
[23:04:20] <hendursaga> idk, is there some CL pastebin somewhere? :D
[23:04:58] <jmercouris> hendursaga: yes

[23:05:15] <jmercouris> there used to be a one part of cliki, but it got shutdown some time ago

[23:07:36] <pjb> hendursaga: I like http://termbin.com since we can paste with nc, and there's http://ideone.com that can also evaluate the CL code (if it doesn't have dependencies).
[23:07:37] <dije> That's probably more than most users will need
[23:07:49] <dije> Couple of helper funs needed

[23:21:27] <dije> jmercouris: Very welcome, glad to be able to contribute back
[23:22:17] <aartaka> dije: That's cool! Small code-review: you actually don't need to prefix everythibg with `ph/`. Common Lisp (in contrast to Emacs Lisp) has packages protecting names from collisions. :nyxt-user (the default package of config) is alright to alter to your needs -- it's made specifically for it, actually :)

[23:28:30] <dije> aartaka: Updated accordingly
[23:29:28] <mariari> nyxt still crashes but since the package changes, I think it's just nromal nyxt crashes and not the additional library mismatches ontop
[23:29:38] <mariari> still crashes 3-4 times a day when under use, but not too bad
[23:33:15] <jmercouris> lol 3-4 times a day isn't /too/ bad I guess
[23:33:17] <jmercouris> :-D
[23:33:19] <aartaka> dije: cool! Another thing: are `ph/buffer-url` etc. defined in your config? While those are mostly trivial to understand, not having them can confuse the copy-pasters :) It would be perfect if you expand those or list them alongside the snippet!
[23:33:47] <aartaka> jmercouris: still bad though :/

[23:38:50] <jmercouris> R O S E T T A
[23:39:11] <jmercouris> mariari: C R A S H
[23:39:32] <dije> aartaka: well that's great to know, I suspected there might be a pre-baked library fun somewhere
[23:39:32] <jmercouris> well, we are getting better
[23:39:45] <jmercouris> when we get to the point where mariari experiences 0 crashes in a day, we'll know we have succeded
[23:40:04] <jmercouris> I plan on doing quite a few changes but I am afraid of branch drift with the work aartaka is doing
[23:40:06] <aartaka> jmercouris: definitely :D
[23:40:12] <mariari> yeah that will be nice
[23:40:17] <jmercouris> which is why though it IS incomplete, I want to merge it
[23:40:18] <mariari> nyxt crashes a lot, I think these crashes are due to webkit
[23:40:27] <mariari> the new stuff  helped a lot
[23:40:30] <jmercouris> mariari: yes, but we should be able to tame its crashiness
[23:40:37] <jmercouris> in some tomato of a way
[23:40:40] <mariari> btw it's sbcl corruption
[23:40:45] <mariari> so no debugger to tell me what's up typically :(
[23:40:52] <jmercouris> hm, I blame the kit of the web
[23:40:58] <mariari> yeah
[23:41:05] <mariari> when qute used webkit it was heavily crash heavy
[23:41:14] <aartaka> jmercouris: web-exts and nyxt-urls are mostly ready in terms of features, what's left is review/bugfixes.
[23:41:27] <aartaka> *web-extensions
[23:42:11] *** Quits: waleee (~waleee@2001:9b0:216:8200:d457:9189:7843:1dbd) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[23:44:23] <dije> aartaka: Where can I find doco on package quri, please?
[23:45:06] <aartaka> dije: The short answer is nowhere :)
[23:45:12] <dije> Also, for the moment, does quri:url-encode have the same signature as my (Rosetta's) url-encode?
[23:45:20] <mariari> ahh nyxt heard me saying it crashes and decided to crash
[23:45:37] <jmercouris> lol
[23:45:45] <aartaka> dije: quri is notoriously undocumented. Luckily, most functions are obvious.
[23:46:01] <mariari> at least proton mail doesn't automatically you log out these days
[23:46:09] <mariari> jmercouris: btw I found a new bug, some websites copy doesn't work in nyxt
[23:46:15] <dije> OK, so quri:url-encode is one string in, one string out
[23:46:15] <mariari> and C-z should probably be rebound for application mode
[23:46:16] <jmercouris> mariari: very odd
[23:46:19] <jmercouris> probably they are blocking it
[23:46:20] <mariari> as editors use it for undo
[23:48:26] <aartaka> jmercouris: How about refactoring copying to be rather selection fetching (JS) + clipboard setting (CL)? Will it solve the problem?
[23:49:29] <dije> aartaka: Updated my discourse post again, this time to use quri:encode-url
[23:49:51] <mariari> jmercouris: btw was it ever found why pasting gets forgotten often?
[23:50:07] <jmercouris> mariari: no, I don't know
[23:50:18] <jmercouris> aartaka: it will solve the problem, yes
[23:50:27] <jmercouris> UNLESS selecting is automatically reset by some JS timer on the page
[23:50:29] <aartaka> dije: Good to know!
[23:50:51] <aartaka> jmercouris: Web being Web, I wouldn't be surprised xD
[23:51:24] <aartaka> Though it's much less probable than keyboard shortcut collision.
[23:52:35] <dije> mariari: "pasting gets forgotten" sounds like something I've just run into for the first time right now, in the last 20 minutes, where neither C-y (Emacs bindings) nor C-v (CUA) pastes, but middle-click still works (probably thanks to `copyq`, which I have running in the background)
[23:52:53] <dije> Is that what you mean?
[23:53:21] <mariari> ahh not quite, but yeah keys can get dropped when in certain modes, C-v could paste depending if you are in application mode or not (?)
[23:53:30] <mariari> but more of after you paste in some text and press enter it won't registered that you pasted
[23:53:37] <mariari> so you have to <space> <backspace> to force it
[23:53:47] <mariari> happens a lot in forms and the minibuffer in nyxt
[23:53:59] <dije> Ah, I noticed I accidentally toggled application mode a few minutes back. No idea what that means
[23:54:11] <mariari> so application mode lets your keys fall through to the webpage
[23:54:18] <mariari> so it triggers the webpage keys and not nyxt keys
[23:54:21] <mariari> C-z by default
[23:54:32] <dije> Ah-ha! Familiar with the concept from Conkeror.
[23:54:44] <dije> Didn't have that name there, AFAICR
[23:57:06] <mariari> yeah some people call it pastthrough mode?
[23:57:19] <dije> That sounds more familiar
[23:57:29] <jmercouris> yes, this is not the first time people are confused about the name
[23:57:34] <jmercouris> perhaps we should rename...
[23:57:39] <dije> +1
[23:58:28] <mariari> passthrough mode may be a better name
[23:58:43] <mariari> also changing the key would be good due to C-z being undo in applications often
[23:58:51] <mariari> I found I can't undo in nyxt at all
[23:58:57] <jmercouris> Hm
[23:59:01] <jmercouris> what key would you suggest?
[23:59:10] <jmercouris> it has to be obvious... which is a problem
[23:59:13] <jmercouris> because others will try to bind it
[23:59:49] <mariari> not entirely sure C-p maybe but idk.... I've found trying to rebind minibuffer and text buffers keys didn't work last time I checked
