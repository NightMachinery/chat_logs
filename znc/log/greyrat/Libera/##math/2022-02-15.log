[00:04:49] <isekaijin> In the sense that xy e^{-x^2 y^2} is constant along each hyperbola.
[00:04:56] <isekaijin> Right?

[00:05:31] <isekaijin> Namely, along the hyperbola xy = c, we have xy e^{-x^2 y^2} = c e^{-c^2}.

[00:09:11] <isekaijin> Well, it's possible that two distinct hyperbolas belong to the same level set.

[00:09:40] <isekaijin> But if you fix a hyperbola H and a level set S, then either H is fully contained in S, or H doesn't intersect S at all.

[00:13:31] <EdwardHaas> Would anyone be willing to discuss this problem with me? I've asked a couple times now, but I keep getting ignored...
[00:13:31] <EdwardHaas> https://gist.github.com/EFHIII/4b352a2fad00ae229a1f91273a706435
[00:14:22] <riv> EdwardHaas: I would suggest posting this on mathoverflow maybe?
[00:14:43] <riv> it looks too difficult for me to say anything useful about
[00:15:15] <riv> pretty cool stuff so far
[00:15:41] <EdwardHaas> As I mentioned in that document someone else asked it here https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4320878/how-many-ways-can-n-identical-rings-be-interconnected-in-3-dimensions a few months ago, but there's no useful response.

[00:15:57] <riv> its very tricky to take the actualy physical geometry fo a solid circle into account
[00:16:00] <riv> i assume you use 0 width tubes
[00:16:24] <riv> usually we allow stretching bending..
[00:16:29] <riv> to take that out the picture
[00:17:11] <EdwardHaas> "each ring (torus) is assumed to have the same major radius and an arbitrarily small minor radius." refers to 0 width tubes.
[00:17:12] <EdwardHaas> I know you usually allow stretching and bending; that's part of what has made finding information to help me so hard.
[00:17:19] <riv> question: is every 4-connected links.. a 3-connected links with one added?
[00:17:30] <EdwardHaas> Yes
[00:17:32] <riv> or is there something where any ring removed makes the whole thing fall appart?
[00:18:14] <EdwardHaas> Brunnian links are not possible when you restrict it to circles
[00:18:16] <riv> ah you already have an upper bound, that is very good
[00:18:19] <riv> I see

[06:45:19] <PlanckWalk> You can reason lots of ways to give the same conclusion
[06:47:05] <greenbagels> remii: limits in 2D exist only if limits from every possible direction exist, loosely speaking
[06:47:11] <PlanckWalk> It would be enough just to use two lines out to infinity, e.g. along the x axis and y axis.

[09:00:39] <remii> isekaijin I don't know why I have such a hard time with this, it might be the fact that I deep inside know I haven't studied hyperbolic geometry yet so I get off..

[09:01:05] <greenbagels> the idea is that a limit cannot exist if you get two different values following two different curves to the same limit point
[09:01:18] <greenbagels> (or in this case, the improper "point at infinity")
[09:01:19] <remii> Yea I'm with  you on that.
[09:01:37] <greenbagels> so we know for sure the limits following the curves y=0 or x=0 are both 0
[09:01:49] <greenbagels> so now we want to see if we can come up with a curve whose infinity limit is nonzero
[09:01:55] <greenbagels> as our distance from the origin grows

[09:02:51] <isekaijin> First we consider the case of limits when x -> p, where p is a point in R^n.
[09:03:06] <greenbagels> remii: so in our case the function has a nice property that xy*e^(-x^2y^2) is the same thing as xy*e^(-(xy)^2)
[09:03:20] <isekaijin> Let A be a subset of R^n, and let p be an accumulation point of A not contained in A.
[09:03:22] <greenbagels> so this suggest that maybe if we substitute in something for xy, we can play with it

[09:04:41] <isekaijin> Now let B be a subset of A such that p is still an accumulation point of B.
[09:05:08] <greenbagels> remii: this, i imagine, was the motivation some eople saw for picking a = xy

[09:13:42] <remii> What I was actually doing was to try and get a geometric interpretation of the problem. This might be a stupid question but I can approach the limit with any curve in the same direction? Direction would be to infinity say.
[09:13:49] <remii> Not sure how to properly formulate that.
[09:14:20] <isekaijin> The proper way to formulate that is using accumulation points.
[09:14:36] <Galois> you said <remii> Yea I'm with  you on that.
[09:14:51] <Galois> if you can't properly formulate what you just said, then you shouldn't be "with you"
[09:15:38] <Galois> you have to translate that interpretation into a specific statement involving the precise definition of limit that you were given
[09:16:25] <Galois> (when the math gets harder than this, you might not always be able to work everything back to the original definitions, but here in this case, you can and should do that)
[09:16:38] <isekaijin> remii: Let's work with a different problem for the time being. Let f(x,y) = xy / (x^2 + y^2), considered as a function on R^2 minus the origin. How do you show that lim_{(x,y) -> origin} f(x,y) doesn't exist?
[09:17:12] <remii> The definition of accumulation points I'm familiar with is from Courant "There is at least one point x such that in every interval, no matter how small, about the x there lie infinitely many of the given numbers".
[09:17:18] <remii> Took that part out of the book.
[09:17:31] <isekaijin> That definition works in R.
[09:17:41] <isekaijin> You have to replace intervals with balls to make it work in R^n.
[09:17:53] <remii> isekaijin I would use polar coordinates.
[09:18:06] <Galois> that definition is not precise enough for my students. Coordinates have nothing to do with it.

[09:19:28] <remii> isekaijin Exactly, and I understand the fact that for the limit to exists, then every possible path must converge to the same limit.
[09:19:56] <isekaijin> Okay, in the case for limits when x^2 + y^2 -> inf, the situation is very similar.
[09:20:22] <remii> I'm just not sure what *every path* means here. Like I don't see how we can use the hyperbola xy=a in the problem above.
[09:20:33] <isekaijin> remii: You take the plane R^2 and add a “point at infinity”. You get a sphere.
[09:21:20] <remii> What does that mean?
[09:22:26] <Galois> lim_{z -> infinity} f(z) = L means: for every epsilon, there exists M > 0 such that for all z such that |z| > M, |f(z) - L| < epsilon

[09:23:46] <remii> Yes so far so good.
[09:24:01] <Galois> from this definition alone, you should be able to see why xy = a can be used

[10:41:17] <Galois> by myopically focusing exclusively on the provability issue, you deny about 90% of math
[10:41:18] <blackk> so could we get back to my free presentations of modules :D

[10:49:34] <PlanckWalk> And that's pure clickbait.
[10:49:35] <Galois> and you, and the 500k upvoters, are far from math experts. You're just spouting word salad.
[10:49:50] <blackk> over a noetherian ring (which is usually the ring of polynomials in computer algebra)
[10:50:31] <Galois> even a simple fix such as "potentially fatal" would be at least something that I could admit
[10:50:36] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[10:51:30] <PlanckWalk> Even that's a stretch, but at least a plausibly justifiable one.
[10:51:42] <greenbagels> honestly flaw is a stretch to me heh
[10:51:52] <greenbagels> but i can see why someone would argue its a flaw
[10:51:58] <greenbagels> for reasons you mentioned
[10:52:01] <blackk> in computer algebra we often deal with noetherian rings.. but there sometimes also non-noetherian rings
[10:52:12] <brownorange> @Galois what would you call a computer program that locksup in an infinite loop with no answer?
[10:52:25] <Galois> certainly not a fatal flaw to all computers
[10:52:30] <blackk> my favourite example is the ring of integer valued polynomials
[10:52:48] <W> mathematics does not always live up to the pedestal people (including some mathematicians) put it on
[10:52:56] <greenbagels> blackk: integer valued, or integer coefficients?
[10:53:02] <W> this does not change what mathematics is, or can do, it was the pedestal that was the problem
[10:53:04] <blackk> integer valued
[10:53:08] <brownorange> it's not fatal to the total functioning of math sure, but if math is all encompassing e.g. with infinities, to some this is a huge deal.
[10:53:21] <blackk> it is a subring of the (univariate) polynomials over the rational numbers
[10:53:29] <greenbagels> i see
[10:53:34] <W> some people put a great deal into the success of corporate brands too
[10:53:35] <greenbagels> that makes sense
[10:53:36] <blackk> ring of polynomial over Q in one variable is noetherian
[10:53:41] <Galois> to any actual mathematician this is not a huge deal, in fact it's a complete nothingburger
[10:53:59] <Galois> we already understand this "flaw" and how to live with it
[10:54:20] <Galois> just like we can make computers useful despite not solving the halting problem
[10:54:22] <blackk> so the are polynomials f in Q[t] such that f(z) is an integer for any integer z
[10:54:29] <Galois> If you think otherwise then I invite you to stop using your computer.
[10:54:33] <brownorange> but if you completely knew how to live with it, you could remake math to be complete by cutting out wffs that are undecidable

[10:55:00] <Galois> that is where you are wrong. But I've explained enough for anyone not deliberately obtusely argumentative to understand my point.
[10:55:17] <blackk> division is non-trivial in this ring and the quotients are far from unique
[10:55:25] <greenbagels> the fact that someone would call it a flaw, i feel, presupposes that someone has an expectation that math ought to handle all potential truths or falsehoods
[10:55:35] <Galois> exactly that.
[10:55:49] <Galois> you're starting from a false presupposition.
[10:56:08] <brownorange> how can you be sure math doesn't start from that presupposition give it can self-reference
[10:56:27] <greenbagels> because i choose what i expect from math
[10:56:45] <Galois> I've already explained. We don't need to be sure. Preponderance of the evidence, in this case, is enough.
[10:57:09] <greenbagels> did i have this assumption when i first started learning math, as a layman? no
[10:57:32] <Galois> even if you did have that presupposition, upon seeing it proved false, you would have to revise your position.
[10:57:39] <blackk> did you really cared when you started?
[10:57:47] <Galois> The only way you get into your ridiculously stupid box is by failing to do that.
[10:57:58] <greenbagels> did i develop this assumption at some point during college before learning about modern logic results? probably, but by that point, my awareness of what math could do grew much compared to before, so i dont think there's much reason to believe that was an accurate picture at that time either
[10:58:24] <W> in general, when one of the assumptions or conjectures people make about mathematics as a whole is proven false or shown incoherent, it is because we have a new tool that allowed us to do so, more mathematics. This is only ever beneficial
[10:58:50] <greenbagels> so i dont think at any given time i went "man, really? there are unprovable/falsifiable statements? what a flaw"

[11:53:30] <brownorange> @PlanckWalk self-reference implies recursion, but recursion need not be self-reference. The mechanism of repeated use of successor function need not be self-referential. In fact it isn't. I'm not sure successor function is even recursion frankly. Self-reference is possible by an addressing scheme with numbers and encoding(s)

[12:32:11] <brownorange> if we begin every proposition with IPT, meaning "it is provable that", then every wff must be asserting a true/false statement. because something must be provable or not provable. there's no inbetween.

[13:09:59] <riv> yes

[13:10:29] <riv> for example 14 / 3
[13:10:41] <riv> 14 = 3 * 4 + 2
[13:10:46] <z4kpi> ok
[13:10:53] <riv> 14 / 3 is 4 remainder 2
[13:11:03] <z4kpi> | is not /
[13:11:09] <z4kpi> ok
[13:11:19] <riv> 14 / 3 = 4 + 2/3
[13:11:44] <riv> just different ways to write the same thing
[13:11:49] <riv> now the method to calculate this
[13:11:52] <riv> start with 14
[13:11:55] <riv> subtract 3 repeatedly
[13:12:05] <riv> 14, 11, 8, 5, 2
[13:12:17] <riv> we had to subtract 4 times, to get 2 remaining
[13:13:06] <z4kpi> I see
[13:13:23] <riv> want to try one? 17 / 5 ?
[13:14:01] <z4kpi> 17 - 5 repeatedly
[13:14:04] <riv> yes
[13:14:09] <z4kpi> 12, 7, 2
[13:14:11] <z4kpi> 3 times
[13:14:14] <z4kpi> 2 remainder
[13:14:16] <riv> perfect
[13:14:20] <riv> 17 = 5 * 3 + 2
[13:14:31] <riv> so that is really it, the division algorithm
[13:14:32] <z4kpi> the last one that's right before 0 would be the remainder
[13:14:41] <z4kpi> and the number of times is q
[13:14:42] <riv> yes
[13:14:57] <z4kpi> ok, thanks!
[13:15:16] <riv> given N,D, D <= N we can find q,r with 0 <= r < q satisfying N = D q + r
[13:16:01] <z4kpi> would this be O(q)?
[13:16:20] <riv> yes it takes q steps
[13:16:27] <riv> but q is part of the output

[13:32:34] <gandaro> z4kpi: From what I can tell, there are several ways a calculus course can be structured, and one of the choices is whether the real numbers are introduced constructively (starting out with the natural numbers, then the integers, then the rationals, then the reals) or axiomatically: "here they are and that's how they work". I would have liked to
[13:32:35] <gandaro> have gone the constructive route too, but in my course we also just had the axioms. But now I don't feel like I am held back by that in my understanding of calculus so far

[14:01:38] <gandaro> It probably makes sense to try to do a lot of proofs for you, as a way to gauge how much you would enjoy math at university level. On the other hand, even if writing proofs might be hard for you right now, it might be different at university, because you'd have tutors and other students who would be there to help you, also you would be exposed to a
[14:01:39] <gandaro> lot more proofs in the lectures all the time.
[14:04:34] <gandaro> Coming back to the textbooks. If you don't like Spivak's book, and it might just be too slow for you, there should be nothing wrong with trying to work through Tao's Analysis I instead. But you should also prepare for there to be parts of the course that don't seem interesting or useful at first, but in the end it hopefully becomes clearer. So you
[14:04:34] <gandaro> should try not to get demotivated by that
[14:04:35] <z4kpi> at this point I think I'm more interested in tinkering than I am way abstract stuff (such as category theory).

[18:20:41] <trace987> okay, if nothing can be said what actually is wrong, its not possible to continue
[18:20:59] <isekaijin> I don't think it's easy to say “algebra is about X”, where “X” is a single thing that subsumes everything an algebraist might care about. But, roughly speaking, we most often care about structures defined by finitary operations and equational laws. (However, there are exceptions!)
[18:21:25] <trace987> yes, it is not easy!!!
[18:21:57] <isekaijin> Oh, and we care about how these structures are related to one another, using homomorphisms, universal properties, etc.

[22:23:53] <tempate> i.e. my book doesn't mention compatible charts
[22:23:54] <Franciman> do you understand this part?
[22:24:08] <tempate> Yeah
[22:24:15] <Franciman> ok, two Atlases A_1, A_2 are compatible
[22:24:16] <Franciman> when
[22:24:21] <Franciman> each chart in A_1 is compatible with each chart in A_2
[22:24:34] <Franciman> in other words
[22:24:36] <Franciman> if
[22:24:40] <Franciman> A_1 u A_2 is again an atlas
[22:24:44] <greenbagels> johnk36: this would be true, if you were starting at t_0 = 0
[22:24:59] <greenbagels> imagine if a projectile flew for only 1 second, but t_0 is 100 seconds
[22:25:05] <tempate> That makes a lot of sense
[22:25:07] <greenbagels> then t = 101, but surely the projectile was not flying for 101 seconds
[22:25:09] <tempate> Thank you very much

[22:29:46] <Franciman> or smooth surfaces?
[22:29:51] <tempate> topological surfaces
[22:29:55] <Franciman> ohhh
[22:29:59] <Franciman> then everything is damn easier
[22:30:08] <greenbagels> johnk36: right; so in this case, your equations calculate t, which is the "landing time", not the flight time

[22:30:32] <greenbagels> you can intuitively think about it this way:
[22:30:48] <greenbagels> v0 * sin a is the starting y velocity
[22:30:49] <tempate> Franciman: https://imgur.com/a/LgH3uZK
[22:30:53] <Franciman> a n-chart of X is a pair (U, f) with U open set of X and f : U -> R^n an homeomorphism
[22:30:55] <Franciman> right?
[22:30:56] <tempate> That's my textbook's definition
[22:30:59] <Franciman> i think you have given something along that line
[22:31:04] <Franciman> now the definition of atlas
[22:31:10] <Franciman> is what yo usaid
[22:31:14] <Franciman> there is no need of compatibility
[22:31:17] <greenbagels> at the "inversion point", this y velocity should be zero; it will take v0 * sin(a) / g seconds for this to happen
[22:31:21] <Franciman> now tempate
[22:31:25] <Franciman> two atlases are always compatible
[22:31:33] <greenbagels> but because the projectile motion is symmetric about the inversion point, like you said earlier
[22:31:43] <greenbagels> two times *this* quantity will give the total flight time
[22:31:46] *** Joins: sobkas (~sobkas@95.175.17.217)

[22:32:03] <greenbagels> the left half is just t0 --- the "starting offset"
[22:32:08] <greenbagels> or starting time
[22:32:16] <Franciman> tempate: you are speaking about holomorphic atlases

[22:32:34] <Franciman> there is an analytical structure here
[22:32:41] <tempate> All the transition functions are holomorphic
[22:32:58] <Franciman> ok
[22:33:03] <Franciman> then my definition as before works
[22:33:07] <Franciman> an atlas is not what you said

[22:33:45] <Franciman> i.e.

[22:34:09] <tempate> Sweet, I like that definition
[22:34:20] <Franciman> by compatible i mean that the transition functions are holomorphic
[22:34:36] <Franciman> can you see why saying A_1 u A_2 is an holomorphic atlas

[22:44:10] <Franciman> i think it is better to use them
[22:44:12] <Franciman> because yes
[22:44:15] <Franciman> it makes things clear
[22:44:18] <Franciman> it's basically this
[22:44:21] <tempate> But I was trying to make sense of it all with the things my book is talking about
[22:44:26] <tempate> ok, I'm happy to use them
[22:44:26] <Franciman> two charts are compatibile when their transition function is holomorphic
[22:44:48] <Franciman> (in other context you may require the transition to be C^inf, or just continuous)
[22:44:52] <tempate> In that case, yes, I understand why it's a sufficient and necessary condition

[22:45:40] <Franciman> tempate: do you know what it means when it says that 1 : S -> S is holomorphic?
[22:47:48] <tempate> Franciman: I think I do. In layman terms, it means that at every x in S we can take a point from C, send it to S with the inverse of a chart (any chart), send it through 1, and then send it back to C with a chart (again, with any chart)
[22:48:19] <tempate> Franciman: so it basically means that that function I just described is holomorphic
[22:48:27] <Franciman> ok tempate great
[22:48:29] <Franciman> now follow me
[22:48:41] <Franciman> take a chart (U, f) from A_1
[22:49:13] <johnk36> greenbagels ok, I understand what you said, for t0 not equal  to zero the formula that I posted represents the landing time and not the time of flight
[22:49:13] <Franciman> take a point x_0 \in U
[22:49:20] <Franciman> then i : S -> S is holomorphic in x_0
[22:49:29] <Franciman> so there is a chart (V, f) in A_2
[22:49:31] <Franciman> ups
[22:49:35] <Franciman> a chart (V, g) in A_2
[22:49:36] <Franciman> such that
[22:49:49] <Franciman> U \subseteq V
[22:50:06] <Franciman> and g . i . f^{-1} is holomorphic

[22:50:28] <Franciman> so the transition function from (U, f) to (V, g) is holomorphic!
[22:50:59] <tempate> nice
[22:51:31] <Franciman> so each chart from A_1 is compatible with a chart in A_2
[22:51:59] <Franciman> this is enough
[22:52:16] <tempate> Yeah, I can see that
[22:52:26] <Franciman> what is the name of this book, tempate ?
[22:52:28] <Franciman> i don't quite like it
[22:52:30] <Franciman> lol
[22:52:39] <tempate> Kirwan's Complex Algebraic Curves
[22:52:48] <Franciman> i don't know it, ok
[22:52:51] <Franciman> tempate: i hope this is clear
[22:52:56] <Franciman> tell me if there is any obscure part
[22:53:17] <tempate> Yes, the definition of compatible charts you gave me has made everything much clearer
[22:53:49] <tempate> but I must confess that the whole transition function part is kind of obscure. how do they help us?
[22:54:08] <Franciman> transition functions help in the definition of holomorphic functions
[22:54:26] <tempate> Yeah, that's what I thought
[22:54:28] <tempate> That's it?
[22:54:29] <Franciman> because they basically mean that the analytical properties of the function don't depend on the chart
[22:54:33] <Franciman> you choose
[22:54:36] <Franciman> because if you change chart
[22:54:39] <johnk36> greenbagels so, also the (1) equation (t star) for t0 different from zero represent landing time
[22:54:47] <Franciman> the transition is an holomorphic bijective function
[22:54:56] <Franciman> err biholomorphic
[22:55:36] <Franciman> so the properties of the function don't depend on the chart you choose
[22:56:21] <tempate> fair enough
[22:56:48] <Franciman> tempate: you can also view this in this way
[22:57:18] <Franciman> the local representation of the function varies with the choice of charts
[22:57:35] <Franciman> but the way it varies is nice
[22:57:41] <Franciman> if charts are compatible

[22:58:31] <Franciman> you can change coordinates but the important properties stay the same
[22:58:39] <Franciman> only difference is that here coordinates are local
[22:58:48] <tempate> I see
[22:58:49] <Franciman> and the change of coordinates is nonlinear
[22:59:02] <Franciman> well can be non linear
[22:59:14] *** Joins: seninha (~seninha@user/seninha)
[22:59:20] <tempate> so the important thing is that the images of intersecting charts are homeomorphic
[22:59:43] <Franciman> no
[23:00:02] <Franciman> not homeomorphic but isomorphic
[23:00:21] <Franciman> also it's important
[23:00:33] <Franciman> that you specify what functions you speak about
[23:01:33] <Franciman> tempate: what i mean is that
[23:01:42] <Franciman> (U, f) and (V, g) are compatible when
[23:02:15] <Franciman> f . g^{-1} : g(U n V) \subseteq C -> f(U n V) \subseteq C
[23:02:22] <Franciman> so you are right
[23:02:28] <Franciman> but you must take into account
[23:02:35] <Franciman> that the isomorphism must be given by f . g^{-1}
[23:03:03] <tempate> Hmmm
[23:03:04] <tempate> Alright

[23:56:41] <brownorange> buster, you're referring to Decid-para?
[23:57:09] <brownorange> or you dislike the axioms themselves?

[23:58:34] <carrot98[m]> :(
[23:59:01] <pyzozord> so math history book recomendations?
[23:59:18] <brownorange> @buster i'm not sure the axioms guarantee soundness. and it's not my problem that a provability paradox is a contradiction
[23:59:42] <brownorange> the whole point is to construct a system to make the paradoxes look silly
