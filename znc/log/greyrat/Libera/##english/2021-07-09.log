[00:00:19] <pussipupu> sandals are bad in sand
[00:00:49] <lall-> i thought they are good.
[00:00:55] <TimMc> eqw: Those would be sandals in American English.
[00:01:05] <blkshp> Sandals in UK too.
[00:01:21] <pussipupu> I find they acquire sand too much
[00:01:29] <TimMc> I usually think of sandals as having a heel strap as well, but "sandal" is more correct here than "flip-flop".
[00:01:45] <TimMc> They're definitely not slippers.
[00:01:53] <blkshp> you could possibly refer to them as slides?
[00:02:00] <TimMc> I couldn't.
[00:02:06] <lall-> dude that thing he pasted here is not sandals
[00:02:16] <blkshp> I have heard people calling things like them with nike logos on as slides but as i wouldn't be seen dead in them, im not sure
[00:02:17] <pussipupu> flip flops to me are specifically the ones with a strap between the big and second toes
[00:02:23] <pussipupu> yes they are sandals
[00:02:27] <lall-> sandals have like a strap on the heel
[00:02:32] <blkshp> pussipupu: thongs!
[00:02:46] <lall-> https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81kFKcc6GsL._SL1500_.jpg
[00:02:48] <lall-> like so
[00:02:51] <blkshp> ok, only to aussies!
[00:03:01] <pussipupu> Australians call flip-flops thongs for that reason, yes
[00:03:11] <lall-> just ask chech people
[00:03:19] <TimMc> I have these, or something like them, and they're called sandals: https://images.the-house.com/birkenstock-arizona-wmns-sandals-mocha-birkibuc-17.jpg
[00:03:28] <TimMc> They hold relatively tight to the foot.
[00:03:29] <blkshp> Open toe shoes amazon call the,
[00:03:30] <lall-> oh no
[00:03:31] <blkshp> them*
[00:03:42] <pussipupu> Shoes are terrible
[00:03:45] <lall-> don't have that.
[00:03:52] <pussipupu> They never fit
[00:03:54] <TimMc> Well yes, I mostly go barefoot.
[00:03:55] <lall-> i shoudl shut up. i wear crocs.
[00:04:01] <TimMc> hah
[00:04:03] <blkshp> yes, you should.
[00:04:07] <pussipupu> Amazon are also terrible and don't get a vote
[00:04:15] <blkshp> And hang your head in shame and burn them
[00:04:18] <blkshp> :D
[00:04:20] <pussipupu> I wear fake Crocs sometimes
[00:04:30] <blkshp> pussipupu: i just reverse looked up the image and it's the only one in English
[00:04:58] <lall-> but they are so airy.
[00:05:05] <lall-> airy? is that a word 
[00:05:26] <lall-> it's an aquired taste, like coffee.
[00:05:39] <TimMc> It's a word, but not the right one.
[00:05:45] <TimMc> They have good air circulation?
[00:05:51] <pussipupu> anyway, night
[00:05:54] <blkshp> don't you fucking compare Crocs to coffee you evil bastard
[00:05:56] <lall-> yeah. that's the only thing they got going

[00:12:02] <lall-> gotta say blkshp you got peculiar sense of humour you do. catherine tate?
[00:12:03] <Voxel> How would you say: "Also, `some title`, but it hasn't been released, yet." or "Also, `some title`, but it hadn't released, yet."
[00:12:24] <blkshp> I grew up with this
[00:12:31] <lall-> also, catherine tate show is brilliant, but it hasn't been released yet.
[00:12:55] <Voxel> I see, but why?
[00:13:02] <lall-> why what buddy
[00:13:29] <blkshp> lall-: hasn't been released yet? it's from 2000
[00:13:32] <Voxel> I mean, there are different options it seems. Of course, it depends on context, but... https://i.imgur.com/6O0Tg07.png
[00:13:39] <blkshp> I suppose i didn't grow up with it then
[00:13:53] <Voxel> blkshp I assume, it was an answer to my question
[00:13:56] <lall-> I grew up wit OFAH. Super irrelevant fact. OFAH was popular in the UK, and the second place it was popular in was the Balkans. I grew up with it.
[00:14:15] <lall-> and there are still, to this day, reruns of it. every year.
[00:14:18] <blkshp> Voxel: no, prior conversation.
[00:14:35] <blkshp> So if i say "GARRRYYYY" you know what I mean?

[01:33:14] <netcom> Hi! Any chance anybody could provide more info on "patterns" in poems? I like the concept but there's very little information online.
[01:34:22] <lall-> know what pattern means?
[01:35:37] <netcom> lall-: Not really, do you?
[01:36:03] <lall-> i do
[01:36:29] <lall-> does that help you?
[01:37:13] <netcom> lall-: Are you trying to troll me or something?
[01:37:35] <lall-> no
[01:37:43] <lall-> i thought you want to troll me lol.
[01:39:51] <netcom> lall-: So what does a pattern mean to you?
[01:40:01] <netcom> I don't see how you find this funny.
[01:40:59] <lall-> your question was patterns in poems, eh
[01:41:56] <netcom> Yup.
[01:42:37] <lall-> i would have to say that the very nature of poems is patterns.
[01:43:11] <netcom> In what way?
[01:43:14] <netcom> Any examples?
[01:43:49] <lall-> repetition, rhythm, rhyme.
[01:44:07] <lall-> i'm not in the poems, but i do play guitar.. and most things in what i do is repetition (aka patterns)
[01:44:26] <lall-> eg, play blues... pentatonic scales, and phrasing withing I IV V 12 bar
[01:44:34] <lall-> which is a pttern. 
[01:44:44] <lall-> poenms are the same, but different, no?
[01:46:05] <netcom> Your guitar hobby and the scales you choose is probably better off in ##music
[01:46:22] <netcom> I'm asking how patterns are used in poems, and examples of such
[01:46:52] <lall-> and is thisa a ##poem channel?
[01:47:31] <netcom> Lyrics in the English language, I'd say pretty much yes
[01:48:20] <netcom> It's on the forefront of how it's written and spoken in the world today
[01:48:26] <netcom> From North America to the Commonwealth
[01:50:26] <lall-> what, poems?
[01:50:44] <netcom> lall-: Like how you can take one sentence, dissect it into parts, and make the entire thing rhyme and rhythmically fit in with another sentence
[01:52:53] <lall-> rhyme is an aspect of culture. how can you do that? because people that appreiate it can get it. Try to just `talk` to a chinese guy, and see how much he understands, never mind poems, rgymes and all

[02:23:34] <netcom> Notice how the Shakespearian parts sounds way better than the modern English one:
[02:23:46] <netcom> Girl, I like your big (what you say?) / Your big ol' heart, what? / Girl, you're crazy, she drive me crazy (crazy) / I love my lady, she nice and shapely (shapely) / She nice and spacey / Take so much space up / Like a big ol' spaceship, yeah so gracious
[02:23:48] <mdogg> https://youtu.be/llBi71jziUk
[02:23:56] <netcom> Versus:
[02:24:00] <netcom> Wench, I liketh thy big (what thee sayeth?) / Thy big ol' heart, what? / Wench, thy're crazy, the lady driveth me crazy (crazy) / I loveth mine own mistress, the lady nice and shapely (shapely) / The lady nice and spacey / Taketh so much space up / Liketh a big ol' spaceship, yeah so gracious
[02:24:37] <mdogg> I've always loved that song - the BBC World News intro.  And I think it's pretty cool how it's in time with "time" by the second. 
[02:25:05] <blkshp> Very cool!

[02:27:37] <mdogg> netcom: Something is the matter with you.
[02:28:52] <blkshp> mdogg: One of the first and only things I remember from primary school when i was about 5 is that we did a little news broadcast and we used the Channel 4 News theme on it. I have loved that tune ever since.
[02:28:54] <netcom> mdogg: I'm quarter black. Could we stay on the topic though?
[02:29:25] <blkshp> No more comments like that, understand?

[02:32:23] <netcom> I just got bullied by 8 teen blonde girls on Bybanen. All of them perfect 10s.
[02:32:23] <netcom> Calling me an ugly loser and all kinds of names.
[02:32:23] <netcom> It was brutal.
[02:32:23] <netcom> I wonder how many lives they've destroyed like that.
[02:32:23] <netcom> Eventually I had enough, stood up like a silverback and started rapping where I'm from: The meanest street and greatest hiphop-label in all of Norway.
[02:32:26] <netcom> Y'all should have seen the fear in their eyes. The guys they were with all ran over to the other wagon. I went over to the alpha-female, looked her deep in her eyes and said "Say something smart." She was paralyzed.
[02:32:28] <mdogg> I've never heard that song before blkshp.  It's pretty cool - a combination of a complete orchestra and a keyboard. 
[02:32:30] <netcom> Then I felt sorry for her, and retreated while saying "You've not said anything smart all fucking day." as I bitch-slapped her three times gently on her feet. I could tell it turned her on. From then on nobody said a word.
[02:32:34] <netcom> After a while her friends left, but she stayed hoping I'd take her home and fuck her. I was like "You ain't even got ass bitch, fuck you." She ran out to her friends almost crying.
[02:32:38] <netcom> It was sorta a lie though. Because she DID have ass.

[19:06:09] <Guest74> Hi all
[19:06:28] <Guest74> I have an English question and I'd be so glad if someone could hep me
[19:07:38] <gildarts> Generally it is best to just ask, rather than asking to ask. :)
[19:07:46] <Guest74> Hi thank you ok
[19:08:00] <Guest74> There is question as the following format :
[19:08:05] <Guest74> W
[19:08:45] <Guest74> "We had a busy morning, Steve --------- the phone calls and I --------- e-mails 
[19:08:54] <Guest74> there are 4 choices for this question
[19:09:14] <kurahaupo> took, answered
[19:09:55] <Guest74> 1) answered- going to deal with 2) was answering - dealing with 3 ) answered - dealt with 4 ) was answering - was dealt with
[19:10:02] <Guest74> no I know the right answer is 3
[19:10:05] <Guest74> now*
[19:10:31] <Guest74> I just don't know why aren't the choice 1 or 2 aren't correct?
[19:10:37] <Guest74> Why is choice 3 correct?
[19:10:47] <Guest74> Hi Kurahaupo
[19:11:04] <kurahaupo> Guest74: 2 lacks an auxiliary verb (was)
[19:11:38] <kurahaupo> 1 refers to different times, which although possible isn't sensible
[19:11:56] *** Joins: Malvolio (~Malvolio@user/malvolio)
[19:12:09] <kurahaupo> 4 is half passive voice
[19:12:12] <Guest74> 1 ) answered - was going to deal with , sorry bad typeed
[19:12:40] <kurahaupo> same conclusion
[19:13:17] <Guest74> why can't we use different times in 1) ?
[19:14:01] <kurahaupo> not because it's grammatically wrong, but because it's not a likely narrative
[19:15:01] <SkunkyLaptop> verb tense problems, there.
[19:15:31] <kurahaupo>  "was going to deal with" leaves open the question of whether you actual did eventually deal with
[19:15:39] *** Quits: fweht (uid404746@id-404746.tooting.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[19:15:44] <Guest74> ohhhh, that's right! thank you sooo much!
[19:16:14] <SkunkyLaptop> 1 and 2 both missing a "was", and 4 mixes verb tenses, answering should be with dealing.
[19:16:17] <kurahaupo> I would expect "but"
[19:17:15] <Guest74> thank you so much
[19:17:32] <kurahaupo> Most verbs can be used for both phone calls and emails: answer; deal with; handle; …
[19:18:10] <kurahaupo> "respond to" would only be email; "take" would only be phone calls
[19:18:48] <kurahaupo> Guest74: are you Lionheart?
[19:18:55] <Guest74> Yes
[19:19:18] <SkunkyLaptop> if you're lionheart, why are you Guest74 ?
[19:19:24] <Guest74> I understand, you are right, thank you so much
[19:19:38] <Guest74> Lol I just wanted to pop in 
[19:19:58] <Guest74> Is there anyway so that I can be connected to Libera using IRC softwares like HexChat?
[19:21:26] <MetaNova> of course
[19:22:49] <MetaNova> ctrl+s -> Add -> name it libera (or whatever you want) -> Edit -> Edit the default server to be irc.libera.chat/+6697 -> Close
