[03:42:51] <Fenderbassist> CB radios were your "Discord" lol
[03:44:17] <MootPoot> I got a baofeng radio and tried to retro my way with the local boomers
[03:44:18] <MootPoot> nobody online
[03:44:29] <Fenderbassist> oh you got a "ham" radio
[03:44:43] <Fenderbassist> you should look up your local repeaters
[03:44:43] <MootPoot> so tell me - how did you describe tits and ass through CB radio
[03:44:49] <MootPoot> Fenderbassist: tried, failed
[03:44:50] <Fenderbassist> assuming you have a license
[03:44:58] <MootPoot> only thing I got wasm the NOAAA weather radio
[03:45:02] <MootPoot> nothing else
[03:45:21] <Fenderbassist> if you're not licensed, don't use a ham radio except in disaster emergencies
[03:45:32] <Fenderbassist> as far as CB, you didn't talk like that, you were speaking to actual girls
[03:45:38] <MootPoot> woah
[03:45:40] <MootPoot> amazing

[03:48:32] <Fenderbassist> you probably have to use repeaters to hear the kind of traffic you want

[03:49:42] <Fenderbassist> lol
[03:49:49] <Fenderbassist> a much greater range than 2 meters
[03:49:56] <Fenderbassist> cb radios had a very limited range
[03:50:06] <Fenderbassist> 1-5 miles roughly, depending

[05:05:26] <isekaijin> Is there some way to access the APKs of installed apps on an Android phone without rooting it?
[05:06:08] <isekaijin> Apparently, APKs are stored in the /data/app directory, but this directory seems to be locked.
[05:06:33] <isekaijin> Like, what the hell? Not even Windows does this. A normal user can access C:\Program Files just fine.
[05:08:36] <ButterNoodle> ever wonder why people hate on windows?
[05:09:22] <ButterNoodle> just enable dev mode and untrusted sources.. then u can install all the root/spyware u want from apk.. just put it in the downlods folder and tap it

[05:57:30] <Satin> I just walked for uh
[05:57:42] <Fenderbassist> 30 minutes?
[05:57:53] <Fenderbassist> last time was 15, I think
[05:58:30] <Satin> well today I didn't get a chance to go to the park/field like I normally do, and it was already 6 by then
[05:58:42] <Fenderbassist> I understand
[05:58:45] <Satin> so I didn't do that, I did some dumbbells beginner excercise for a few minutes
[05:58:49] <Fenderbassist> that works
[05:58:57] <Satin> but then I decided to go outside and get a walk when my watch said i hadn't met my steps goal
[05:59:02] <Satin> but i saw it was entirely dark
[05:59:03] <Fenderbassist> I assume you stretch out to warm up the muscles
[05:59:08] <Satin> so i got my credit card and went to a nearby dollar general
[05:59:20] <Satin> which wasnn't the greatest decision, it was along the sidewalk
[05:59:38] <Satin> but i *hate* american car-centric infran. wide open spaces and all of that, feels unfriendly to us pedestrians
[05:59:49] <Satin> i rarely walk i guess, i drive to such places, but it's like 0.4 miles away
[06:00:09] <Satin> but first a dog was barking across the road and i was afraid, since i'm always afraid of aggressive dogs, but i passed by without anything happening
[06:00:27] <Satin> then across the road again, near the dollar general, there was a guy in front of a laundromat in the dark waving at me or something
[06:00:35] <Satin> and i just immediatly turned the other way
[06:00:36] <Fenderbassist> some dogs are just overly territorial and bark lots
[06:00:54] <Fenderbassist> alerting their pack
[06:01:05] <Satin> and that def made me nervous but he walked the other way more after seeing i wasn't responding i guess
[06:01:30] <Satin> then i got a few things, and then walked back, but this time i went to the field, in more or less complete darkness since it was more familiar and it avoided the apartment complex that had the dog
[06:01:33] <Satin> and felt safer
[06:01:35] <Satin> and then got back
[06:01:52] <Satin> can't even feel safe in my own neighbourhood to take a walk, typical america
[06:02:16] <Satin> IMO if they had less car centric infran and maybe a bit more clumped together it'd be a bit safer maybe in general, i dunno
[06:02:30] <Fenderbassist> do you own a quality flashlight?
[06:02:32] <Satin> In any case that was my walk :P
[06:02:33] <Satin> I don't
[06:02:46] <Fenderbassist> a good flashlight, a cell phone and other things make for good tools for walks
[06:03:00] <Fenderbassist> if you're going to walk at night
[06:03:09] <Fenderbassist> animals will freeze generally with light in their eyes
[06:03:16] <Satin> good point
[06:03:47] <Fenderbassist> if you have a lot of dogs in your area, get some pigs ears
[06:04:02] <Fenderbassist> see a dog that makes you nervous, toss them a pig's ear, a chew toy for hours
[06:04:07] <Fenderbassist> safer for them than the bones
[06:04:16] <Fenderbassist> they will learn to love you lol
[06:04:54] <Fenderbassist> bag from PetSmart doesn't cost much
[06:05:29] <Fenderbassist> also they will recognize your scent and not feel you are encroaching upon the "pack territory"
[06:05:41] <mixfix41> i remember those pig ears never knew why they had so much by the register
[06:05:51] <Fenderbassist> safer for the doggies
[06:05:58] <Fenderbassist> good exercise for their teeth
[06:08:03] <Satin> pigs ears?
[06:08:09] <Satin> like literally pig ears?
[06:08:12] <Satin> oh a chew toy.
[06:08:41] <Satin> interesting.
[06:08:51] * Satin didn't grow up having pets so didn't know this
[06:09:08] <Fenderbassist> I didn't either but was told this but those that do
[06:09:29] <Fenderbassist> so instead of getting those "beef" bones that aren't the best for their digestive track, I get those instead
[06:09:41] <Fenderbassist> unless I have actual rib bones
[06:09:47] <Fenderbassist> chicken bones are super dangerous for them
[06:09:51] <Fenderbassist> but rib bones are good

[06:14:21] <Satin> yeah chicken bones do sound dangerous
[06:14:33] <Fenderbassist> they get caught in a dog's throat
[06:14:36] <Fenderbassist> can choke them
[06:14:43] <Fenderbassist> happened to a friend's dog many years ago
[06:14:55] <Fenderbassist> somehow it got a hold of chicken bones and died
[06:15:08] <Satin> :x damm.
[06:15:16] <Fenderbassist> such is life, sadly
[06:19:23] <Fenderbassist> anyway I recommend a walking kit for night walks 
[06:19:41] <Fenderbassist> flashlight, cell phone of course, anything else you think is prudent
[06:22:54] <Satin> Yeah.
[06:23:23] <Satin> I think in the first place I try to walk during the day generally, this is the first time I thought "eh, why not go for a quick trip to get some zero gateorade and a snack"
[06:23:37] <Satin> Also btw I made these chicken thighs yesterday:
[06:23:38] <Fenderbassist> I understand
[06:24:04] <Fenderbassist> I hope you cooked them thoroughly

[06:24:31] <Satin> I did because I used the meat thermometer that MootPoot  recced from amazon
[06:24:44] <Satin> it said 170, and since 165 F is what's apparently required for chicken to be cooked, yes
[06:25:03] <MootPoot> Ew
[06:25:31] <MootPoot> You use the Feet mode instead of the Cool mode
[06:25:40] * MootPoot is disgusted at Satin 
[06:26:02] <Satin> BASED F MODE
[06:26:05] <Satin> FREEDOM UNITS
[06:26:07] <Fenderbassist> yes that looks well cooked, nicely done
[06:26:13] <Satin> Fenderbassist: thank you :D
[06:26:16] <Fenderbassist> is that mayo in the middle?
[06:26:20] <Satin> yeah HAHA
[06:26:21] <Fenderbassist> good
[06:26:24] <Satin> ever since I realized it was 0 carbs
[06:26:29] <Fenderbassist> for keto, if you eat chicken you definitely need mayo
[06:26:30] <Satin> put a bunch in, it's tastier
[06:26:38] <Fenderbassist> chicken doesn't have enough fat
[06:26:47] <Satin> interersting
[06:26:55] <Fenderbassist> too much protein = sugar, not that you are anywhere close to that amount in that image
[06:27:06] <MootPoot> Imagine needing 170 feet to equal only 71 Cats
[06:27:09] <MootPoot> Smh
[06:27:44] <Fenderbassist> if you made 4x the amount of chicken in that image, I would have said save half for another meal
[06:28:15] <Fenderbassist> cause twice the amount probably would equal 30 grams of chicken, which is the most you can absorb (from what I've read) in a single meal
[06:28:36] <Fenderbassist> and with keto you can have all the fat you want
[06:28:43] <Fenderbassist> anyway, well done
[06:28:47] <Fenderbassist> (no pun intended0
[06:28:49] <Fenderbassist> )
[06:29:15] <Fenderbassist> 30 grams of protein, not chicken lol
[06:29:17] <Satin> I bought some chicken thighs from walmart, the first time I mentioned cooking them a few days ago, if you'll recall
[06:29:29] <Fenderbassist> this is what I get for chatting while being in a D&D game, with my lack of multitasking
[06:29:30] <Satin> I ate 3 that day, saved the seasoned chicken under a wrap in a plate in the fridge
[06:29:38] <Satin> then used the rest of the other 3 yesterday
[06:29:41] <Fenderbassist> cool
[06:29:49] <Fenderbassist> I have chicken all the time, very good protein source
[06:29:52] <Satin> after cooking the
[06:29:56] <Satin> s/the/them/
[06:29:58] <Fenderbassist> rich with BCAA amino acids
[06:30:01] <Satin> mhm yes
[06:30:06] <Satin> I think I prefer the taste over bacon as well
[06:30:24] <Fenderbassist> bacon is an ultimate fat food :)
[06:30:54] <Satin> bacon seems a bit more difficult than I thought to get a good satisfying taste out of when frying it or whatever
[06:30:54] <Satin> unless i pair it with omlettes or something
[06:30:55] <Satin> what else can I grill on a stovetop skillet that tastes nice like grilled chicken hmmmm
[06:31:20] <Fenderbassist> turkey, beef, salmon
[06:31:34] <Fenderbassist> all the bacon you're into doing
[06:31:36] <Satin> I can't really take in seafood much, makes me nauseous for reasons unknown
[06:31:40] <Fenderbassist> gotcha
[06:31:42] <Satin> beef... i'm interested
[06:31:52] <Satin> what sort of beef we talking about here? patties or?
[06:31:52] <Fenderbassist> ground round, ground chuck
[06:31:56] <Fenderbassist> steak
[06:32:00] <Satin> ooh
[06:32:15] <Fenderbassist> pork, though don't eat a lot of it
[06:32:23] <Satin> what's the differences between relying on beef or chicken?
[06:32:25] <Fenderbassist> it has too many Omega 6s and not enough Omega 3s
[06:32:31] <Satin> i guess a good diet would include both?
[06:32:38] <Fenderbassist> beef has a lot more fat, which is good for your keto diet
[06:32:44] <Satin> ooh
[06:33:20] <Fenderbassist> you can buy the less expensive 80 percent lean
[06:33:29] <Fenderbassist> it will work better for keto
[06:33:35] <Fenderbassist> and easier to cook
[06:33:47] <Fenderbassist> add mayo or cheese on top
[06:35:04] <Fenderbassist> beef also rich in the BCAA's (Branched Chain Amino Acids)
[06:35:16] <Fenderbassist> 30 grams of protein per meal is the intake limit
[06:35:22] <Fenderbassist> all the fat you want
[06:35:26] <Fenderbassist> and of course the carb limit
[06:36:20] <Satin> interesting
[06:36:29] <Satin> lean = less fat when butchered?
[06:37:20] <Fenderbassist> the higher the lean rating, the less fat in the packaged meat
[06:37:32] <Fenderbassist> 95 percent lean has way less fat than 75 percent lean
[06:37:37] <Satin> makes sense
[06:37:45] <Fenderbassist> fast food restaurants generally use 50 percent lean
[06:37:49] <Satin> so less calories i assume
[06:37:50] <Fenderbassist> fat = flavor
[06:37:53] <Satin> as a result
[06:37:57] <Fenderbassist> less fat is less calories yes
[06:38:03] <Satin> interesting
[06:38:14] <Fenderbassist> fat is a much higher calorie density than protein or carbs
[06:38:24] <Satin> fascinating
[06:38:30] <Fenderbassist> but if you are on keto, you burn fat as fuel, not carbs
[06:38:33] <Fenderbassist> protein is for repair
[06:38:51] <Satin> I haven't been having much fat at all
[06:38:53] <Satin> then
[06:39:02] <Satin> Mostly protein
[06:39:31] <Fenderbassist> keto requires fat for fuel
[06:39:39] <Fenderbassist> so if you're doing keto, you need more fat
[06:40:16] <Fenderbassist> but good that you have decent protein to repair the body
[06:40:36] <Fenderbassist> sounds like you're doing well
[06:40:39] <Fenderbassist> keep it up

[07:07:43] <Fenderbassist> just walking is great for you
[07:07:45] <Fenderbassist> hi senti 
[07:07:55] <MootPoot> I worked out for a month to try and get the steam off, then about a month in I realized "Why do I have to excercise ot let off the steam when I can just make the problem go away?"
[07:08:03] <MootPoot> So I fucking beat him with a classroom desk
[07:08:09] <MootPoot> and he never did it again
[07:08:17] <Fenderbassist> that's how it usually works
[07:08:18] <MootPoot> fun times
[07:08:25] <Fenderbassist> though exercise is for your long term health
[07:08:30] <Fenderbassist> especially your heart and circulation
[07:08:34] <Fenderbassist> it's for you :)
[07:08:40] <senti> uh, that... is not what I'd describe as fun times, but to each their own, Moot.
[07:09:46] <MootPoot>  btw protip - if you do a lot of bicep curls and pectoral exercise
[07:10:11] <Fenderbassist> I balance them out with the rest
[07:10:12] <MootPoot> you can get *very* adept at flinging a desk at a target within a second with no warning
[07:10:18] <Fenderbassist> yes I bet

[07:10:22] <MootPoot> especially those lighter weight shitty ones
[07:10:29] <MootPoot> tube steel and plywood
[07:10:34] <Fenderbassist> you also want to eat enough protein to support repair of the tissues
[07:10:47] <Fenderbassist> 30 grams per meal, a number of times per day
[07:11:07] <senti> why is it that you guys are so knowledgeable about all this stuff. I'm just lucky I can find my way to the gas station.
[07:11:14] <Fenderbassist> I'm old
[07:11:21] <Fenderbassist> I've been around and learned from a lot of people

[07:30:33] <MootPoot> so murphy's law will make it better for me
[07:33:33] <`Zephyr> Murphy's Law is basically the notion that things will fail you when you need them to not, or if things can go wrong, they will.
[07:33:50] <`Zephyr> For example, a quintessential example of Murphy's Law is that your inkjet printer will fail you when you actually need it.

[07:59:23] <Satin> I guess I'm far more weak than I expected
[07:59:38] <Fenderbassist> I think it just means you're getting used to it
[07:59:40] <Satin> like i can't really keep these 10 lbs each dumbbells up in the air
[07:59:42] <Satin> atm
[07:59:44] <Satin> for too long
[07:59:47] <Satin> lots of shaking
[07:59:52] <Fenderbassist> right, that is normal at the beginning
[07:59:56] <Satin> i guess i have no muscle strength and i've never tried before
[07:59:57] <Satin> i see
[08:00:03] <Fenderbassist> that is normal for most people
[08:00:13] <Fenderbassist> it's not like you do that motion in your every day life
[08:00:23] <Fenderbassist> so yes give your body a chance to get used to it, go gently

[08:06:23] <MootPoot> thats it?
[08:06:30] <Satin> yes
[08:06:32] <amigojapan> I hope it snows all day long
[08:06:33] <MootPoot> how much is that
[08:06:36] <Satin> idk
[08:06:38] <MootPoot> !c 10lb to kg
[08:06:39] <ImoutoBot> MootPoot: 10 Pound = 4.53592 Kilogram
[08:06:42] <MootPoot> .....
[08:06:53] <Satin> MootPoot: 'bout to call me weak? smh
[08:06:53] <MootPoot> what
[08:07:09] <MootPoot> for reference the only dumbell I own and use is a 25kg one
[08:07:17] <Satin> two or one
[08:07:27] <MootPoot> just one at a time - I didnt wanna get 2
[08:07:28] <MootPoot> expensive
[08:07:31] <Satin> bruh
[08:07:39] <Satin> it's not as much about weight but forms
[08:07:40] <MootPoot> although these days I use those rubber bands 
[08:07:49] <Satin> but arguably i'd grow out of 10 lbs quickly but idk really
[08:07:54] <MootPoot> yeah those bands are a lot better for form
[08:07:55] <Satin> i'm having enough effort with 10 for the time being
[08:08:12] <MootPoot> I wonder where that dumbell went
[08:08:26] <Fenderbassist> it's smarter to use less weight for better control when doing forms
[08:08:32] <amigojapan> MootPoot: a little of Canada came to Japan
[08:08:38] <Fenderbassist> over time, you will naturally graduate to higher weights
[08:08:41] <MootPoot> for stuff like that I just use bands
[08:08:41] <amigojapan> Hey Fenderbassist 
[08:08:46] <MootPoot> bands are awesome
[08:08:46] <Fenderbassist> and because your form is good, you will avoid injury
[08:08:51] <Fenderbassist> hey amigojapan how are you doing?
[08:08:52] <MootPoot> cheap, easy to store 
[08:08:56] <MootPoot> amigojapan: give it back!
[08:09:17] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: I am happy cause snow is falling
[08:09:23] <Fenderbassist> so I see
[08:09:32] <Fenderbassist> so you've gone from cherry blossoms to snow
[08:09:33] <MootPoot> Fenderbassist: when I used to gym regularly I think I capped out at like 50-55kg 
[08:09:36] <MootPoot> but then I stopped going
[08:09:41] <MootPoot> 55kg together for both arms
[08:09:54] <Fenderbassist> the good thing is, that since you did it in the past, it will be easier when you resume
[08:10:06] <Fenderbassist> you already have a good background in resistance training
[08:10:24] <amigojapan> Yup Fenderbassist .I hope it snows like 10 years ago when it looked like Hokkaido for a few days
[08:10:27] <Fenderbassist> Satin: and you're doing it smart
[08:10:42] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: sounds cozy
[08:10:47] <Satin> thank you
[08:10:55] <Fenderbassist> I kinda miss the snow of NJ but I don't miss the shoveling :)
[08:11:01] <Satin> I'm trying to look at youtube videos for examples for sure
[08:11:06] <MootPoot> Satin: time to get sweaty

[08:11:25] <Satin> true

[08:11:30] <Fenderbassist> enough protein to aid in recovery
[08:11:37] <Satin> MootPoot: wrong
[08:11:42] <Satin> and i did it for the first time today as well
[08:11:49] <MootPoot> but anyway - if you have the extra money gettins one large resistance band is really nize
[08:11:49] <Satin> didn't get sweaty, just more tired
[08:11:51] <MootPoot> nice
[08:11:52] <MootPoot> super cheap
[08:11:55] <Satin> i c
[08:12:05] <MootPoot> a lot more flexible then dumbells imo
[08:12:11] <Satin> i think the most "uh what" moment i had
[08:12:11] <MootPoot> also wont stub your toe
[08:12:18] <Satin> was when doing a "sumo squat" one

[08:13:04] <Satin> i even heard a slight crackle ig
[08:13:07] <MootPoot> did ur knees pop
[08:13:22] <Satin> yeah but i wasn't sure if to keep going or not, it was clearly stressing them when they're not used to it
[08:13:32] <MootPoot> just dont pull anything
[08:13:37] <Fenderbassist> just make sure you stretch before and after, and drink plenty of water
[08:13:42] <Satin> i see
[08:13:52] <MootPoot> I've found to get back "into it" its easier to do multiple 5 min attempts a day
[08:13:57] <MootPoot> rather then a 30min session

[11:23:24] <senti> Summer, it's f'n raw!
[11:23:45] <SummerSkies> you cont put rawr onions in a carmelized onion soup you FOKEEN DONKAY
[11:24:22] <senti> SummerSkies, there's actually an episode of Hot Ones with Gordon on it.
[11:24:34] <SummerSkies> yeah he basically performs surgery on his mouth
[11:24:48] <senti> Can't remember how far he got. I just remember him dropping 'fuck' a lot.
[11:25:36] <senti> Gordon is actually a good guy. His TV persona, you'd think he's really harsh. But he's a good guy.
[11:25:54] <SummerSkies> I look up to Gordon Ramsay
[11:25:59] <SummerSkies> yes he is an incredible, inspiring man
[11:26:26] <senti> Indeed!
[11:26:32] <SummerSkies> Hell's Kitchen is just comedic, Kitchen Nightmares is genuine frustration with restaurants carelessly feed innocent people harmfully bad food

[11:27:08] <SummerSkies> with the way he acts
[11:27:15] <SummerSkies> I've suspected for quite some time that he's on the spectrum in some type o fway 
[11:27:28] <senti> you have to be
[11:27:30] <SummerSkies> and I believe I have confirmation after finding out his daughter is an officially diagnosed high fucntioning autistic
[11:27:49] <senti> if you want to make it on TV, you have to at least be > 50% crazy
[11:28:01] <SummerSkies> he may be crazy too
[11:28:03] <senti> I could be on TV if that's all it took.
[11:28:06] <SummerSkies> but I've never linked that with being on the spectrum
[11:28:44] <SummerSkies> I've been curious lately what they'd say if I went in for an adult diagnosis
[11:28:54] <SummerSkies> I was considered asperger syndrome I think when I was 4
[11:28:55] <senti> I shouldn't have said crazy, but I think you get what I was saying.
[11:29:29] <SummerSkies> senti: there's such a range of different types of famous people
[11:29:33] <senti> SummerSkies, I struggle with looking people in the eyes. I tend to look away during conversations.
[11:29:38] <SummerSkies> Gordon is the type who got to where he is purely on ability 
[11:29:48] <SummerSkies> yep i got them traits big time
[11:30:12] <SummerSkies> i tell people "if you want me to actually hear what you say, i cant look you in the eyes."
[11:30:12] <senti> rather, I don't really look at the person I'm talking to. I'm always looking away.
[11:30:20] <SummerSkies> they think i'm not listening but it's the only way I can listen 
[11:30:26] <SummerSkies> yeah same exact thing with me
[11:30:45] <senti> mate! You are like me!
[11:30:50] <senti> I'm like you!
[11:31:09] <SummerSkies> senti: do you go through phases of extreme interests in certain things
[11:31:14] <senti> I'd make eye contact with you if I met you, you're a good mate.
[11:31:15] <SummerSkies> sometimes returning to past ones
[11:31:59] <senti> I have one extreme interest, but it's really a matter of me being super interested in it, or me being super lazy and doing nothing.
[11:32:04] <senti> that's pretty much my life.
[11:32:33] <senti> I kinda just ebb and flow I guess?
[11:33:03] <senti> If you took this interest away from me? I'd fight to the death to get it back.
[11:33:20] <SummerSkies> i got phases for days

[12:50:44] <ewong> guess the less we talk about fn the better.
[12:50:53] <emmeka> as far as I know he re-registered the channel on freenode and also still insists to Libera staffers that he is the rightful owner of #anime (which redirects here rn). Be he's also in this channel, too.
[12:51:09] <sentionics> I heard freenode is still around, so I assume he's still there. That's an ASSUMPTION. I don't know. I just imagine he's stilling handling things there.
[12:51:18] <emmeka> freenode technically isn't still around
[12:51:48] <emmeka> the freenode network that we knew was shut down, and a new network put up in its place bearing the same name. all old registrations are gone.

[13:10:52] <emmeka> sentionics if it's any consolation, I'm not built to survive the south
[13:10:54] <sentionics> I'd book it back home
[13:11:00] <emmeka> I die in southern summers
[13:11:29] <sentionics> emmeka, guess we just live in different extremes, ha ha ha
[13:11:46] <emmeka> like walking into a solid wall of steam when you step outside, any physical activity impossible, sweet tea infusion requires for life support
[13:11:55] <sentionics> thanks for saying that mate. I think we are brothers from very different extreme worlds.
[13:12:08] <emmeka> I also always get sick everytime I go to the south
[13:12:23] <emmeka> stupid subtropical diseases, I wasn't made for you!
[13:12:38] <sentionics> emmeka: I can see that. After hurricane Ida, I very much not want to be here.
[13:12:41] <sentionics> but I can't leave
[13:12:47] <sentionics> this is where my family is.
[13:13:11] <sentionics> no electricity, unbearable humid heat. It wasn't good.
[13:13:22] <emmeka> in the words of a famous Canadian, New Orleans is sinkin' man, and I don't wanna swim.
[13:13:25] <sentionics> 2 weeks no electricity after that monster
[13:14:08] <sentionics> emmeka: in the words of more than a few New Orleans folks, "What is damp, will never dry"
[13:15:01] <sentionics> well, Louisiana people are pretty much crazy as hell by default. Some might call me sane... but I'm from Louisiana.
[13:15:54] <sentionics> I mean, I think I'm pretty alright. But I leave the house, and I see my fellow Louisianians...

[14:39:47] <senti> amigojapan, I personally vary between 20 and 25 chars me. 30 is actually beyond what some sites will allow.

[14:49:25] <senti> In all seriousness though. 2 way encryption means... I'd have to type a password to access my passwords.
[14:49:36] <senti> seems like a pain in the ass.
[14:50:12] <senti> (I mean, if it's my own program running the show)
[14:50:46] <`Zephyr> I am no expert at any of this, but this sounds like a stateless password manager, like LessPass. 
[14:50:47] <senti> in the end, that program will have to accept my password to know it's me.
[14:51:11] <`Zephyr> I was under the impression this approach was not recommended. Or is it good enough for most use cases that the pros outweigh the cons?
[14:51:15] <amigojapan> `Zephyr: I trust more something I made
[14:51:17] <senti> my issue with letpass and others, is that they are other entities.

[17:02:14] <Sadale> Is that even a genre?
[17:02:18] <BillyZane> it's starting to become one
[17:02:28] <BillyZane> specifically opening up a pharmacy
[17:02:39] <BillyZane> anime is fuckin weird
[17:02:55] <Sadale> interesting. I didn't know that it's becomong a genre
[17:03:16] <BillyZane> having one anime where you open up a pharmacy is nothing
[17:03:19] <BillyZane> but having two in a row

[18:00:22] <MootPoot> nah, it'll end up costing the same anyway really
[18:00:33] <MootPoot> might as well re-order from aliexpress

[18:06:12] <Sadale> I think the shipping cost from my home to yours would be sub-$10.
[18:06:36] <Sadale> And the shipping cost from the seller to my home would be like $2

[18:42:29] <Bco1981> some times it does not take effect, then go to automatic, and back to disabled again.

[18:45:32] <MootPoot> I use a pretty small space

[19:20:05] <MootPoot> for some reason the top case dosen't work
[19:20:09] <MootPoot> but the bottom if does
[19:22:43] <Sadale> MootPoot, just done watching your vid. I can relate to that.
[19:23:00] <Sadale> MootPoot, That's exactly why I don't intend to make any profit off my FOSS projects
[19:24:07] <Sadale> MootPoot, The syntax could be wrong.
[19:24:15] <Sadale> MootPoot, The select-case syntax. Check it carefully.
[19:24:19] <Poeticode> faker.js on npm still works and there's already a community fork that will be actively maintained and replace that package
[19:24:21] <MootPoot> I did 
[19:24:45] <MootPoot> syntax checks out - its the same both online and on the compiler
[19:24:45] <Sadale> MootPoot, instead of saying "Case Input_NumberPerPage = 5", try saying "Case 5
[19:24:54] <MootPoot> hmm
[19:24:56] <MootPoot> that might be it
[19:25:11] <Jigsy> Mambo = 5
[19:25:15] <MootPoot> Sadale: but also the case works - kinda - it always just goes to 500
[19:25:43] <Sadale> MootPoot, What I suspect is that "Input_NumberPerPage = 5" get evaluated to something that you don't expect
[19:25:49] <Poeticode> think kit was dumb of the guy to delete the repo but I'm glad it's giving more exposure to swartz and the issues of OSS funding (though those two topics are unrelated; swartz was pretty rich from his startups)
[19:26:48] <Sadale> MootPoot, Anyway let's try what I've said and see if it'd work. BTW, you may wish to avoid posting company's code to a public internet channel. It could get you into trouble. xD

[19:29:00] <MootPoot> I'm spoiled with intellisense
[19:29:05] <MootPoot> it would have caught this

[19:29:32] <MootPoot> which is weird, since the variable is locked to a number only

[19:29:39] <MootPoot> VB is shit
[19:29:46] * MootPoot cries out for C#
[19:29:54] <Sadale> I've no idea on how VB works. So you really need to learn the languae to understand what exactly was going on.
[19:30:47] <MootPoot> well
[19:30:55] <MootPoot> fortunately I dont need to deal with it anymore
[19:31:05] <MootPoot> after this month
[19:31:13] <Poeticode> I'm sorry you have to use VB :(
[19:31:14] <Sadale> For example, in C you could write if(foo = 10){ /* content */ } and the program will compile. Except that the content would always get executed because "foo = 10" evaluates to 10, which's a non-zero value (i.e. a true value).
[19:31:28] <Sadale> MootPoot, oh. What you'd do after this month?
[19:31:37] <Sadale> MootPoot, another job? or another project in the same job?
[19:32:24] <MootPoot> I'm on a internship contract so 
[19:32:42] <MootPoot> after this month I need another job - either another job at the same company or another one

[19:35:01] <Sadale> MootPoot, damn. That's even higher than my first job.
[19:35:13] <Sadale> I was severely underpaid for my first job. That company paid shit :/
[19:35:24] <MootPoot> my first job was even less
[19:35:37] <MootPoot> my first job was like 20k but it wasen't a programming one
[19:35:50] <Sadale> Oh. I didn't have a non-programming job. My first job was a programming job
[19:35:53] <Poeticode> I was an unpaid intern for a year ;-;
[19:36:08] <Sadale> That company was so dumb tho. Honestly, that's really a shithole. :/
[19:36:12] <MootPoot> but now I guess I'll have a proper job
[19:36:30] <MootPoot> Poeticode: how big was the difficulty jump from intern-> full job
[19:36:35] <MootPoot> or was it the same

[19:37:02] <Sadale> MootPoot, If you found someone who's looking for a embedded programmer over there and if they pay well that I could achieve my retirement goal earlier, do let me know. :P
[19:37:12] <Poeticode> they first had me contracted out for a year after that, then finally got on salary MootPoot
[19:37:30] <MootPoot> I'm nowhere close to a company that does embedded stuff
[19:37:34] <Poeticode> so I had it easy in that sense
[19:37:50] <Poeticode> dang I wanna do some embedded elixir stuff
[19:38:00] <Sadale> I suspect that intern -> full job wouldn't be that a difficult jump.
[19:38:07] <Sadale> pffft
[19:38:12] <Sadale> No thanks. Embedded yes. elixir please no
[19:38:28] <MootPoot> nut ur elixr on your developement boards

[19:45:01] <MootPoot> 99% of my time is just dragging blocks around

[19:48:35] <Sadale> unless this Blue Prism thingie's popular over there
[19:49:04] <MootPoot> not really - some large companies use it a LOT but aside from that not really

[19:59:27] <Sadale> Poeticode, I'm not sure if my English's good enough for that.
[19:59:45] <Sadale> In fact I can't even communicate that well in my local language. :P
[19:59:45] <MootPoot> to be fair, being rich enough to not work IS the goal of capitalism

[19:59:58] <Poeticode> hm at least in irc you communicate really well
[20:00:07] <Sadale> MootPoot, not true. Those billionaires are still working AFAIK.
[20:00:15] <MootPoot> "working" 
[20:00:20] <Poeticode> i understand that that doesn't translate to understanding native speakers when they talk fast / weird though

[20:00:27] <Sadale> MootPoot, And those billionaires are taking their money like a score board
[20:00:41] <Sadale> MootPoot, actually, delegating work *is* a kind of work

[20:01:15] <Poeticode> hookers and blow take work too :(
[20:01:16] * MootPoot is hungry
[20:01:26] <Poeticode> life is pain tbh
[20:01:49] <Sadale> As for those billionaires, maybe they could delegate pretty much everything so they could just not work. But for normal company's managemenet people, they have to delegate work on their own and they have to take responsibility in case thing goes shit.
[20:02:15] <Sadale> It does require some skill to do that. It's just a different kind of skill from technical skill.

[22:28:38] * MootPoot inhales
[22:28:59] <SummerSkies> emmeka: is that considered a pirate site?
[22:29:11] <emmeka> yes.
[22:29:12] <SummerSkies> i did not know
[22:29:27] <MootPoot> I'm convinced that there is a sekrit book mafia keeping up the price of hardcover books for no reason and charging us like 3x the price of softcover when it basically should cost them like 2 bucks more or something 
[22:29:32] <MootPoot> something something ripoff my money
[22:29:35] <SummerSkies> i thought anime sites that didn't allow downloads were fair game, Emil
[22:29:37] <SummerSkies> emmeka
[22:29:37] * MootPoot exhales
[22:29:52] <emmeka> SummerSkies no.
[22:29:59] <SummerSkies> emmeka: are there any that are allowed 
[22:30:05] <SummerSkies> or are they all pirate sites
[22:30:24] <emmeka> I don't understand the question. Are you asking what pirated content you're allowed to link here? The answer is none.
[22:30:26] <MootPoot> even the fucking used places "hurr durr this is hardcover give us nearly new book money"
[22:30:54] <SummerSkies> I was asking if there is a site that hosts anime shows that is allowed to be linked here
[22:30:56] <emmeka> MootPoot pretty much. Hardcovers are a money grab for no particularly good reason.
[22:31:06] <emmeka> SummerSkies well, official services, if you wanted.
[22:31:28] <MootPoot> dune softcover = 11 bucks. Hardcover = 33
[22:31:36] <SummerSkies> right, like funimation streaming or something
[22:31:37] <MootPoot> it gets worse with academic books
[22:31:38] <emmeka> you're overpaying
[22:31:47] <emmeka> go into any used book store, you will find a copy of Dune
[22:31:49] <emmeka> for like $3
[22:32:04] <MootPoot> academic books are like 50$ more for softcover
[22:32:07] <MootPoot> hardcover*
[22:32:57] <emmeka> SummerSkies to clarify you're allowed to *talk* about pirated content here or whatever, just don't like, post links and direct people to how to access it

[22:33:02] <emmeka> k? k.
[22:33:05] <SummerSkies> emmeka: it makes sense
[22:33:21] <SummerSkies> as a result of not thinking very hard about it, I just didn't know it was a site of pirated content, that's all
[22:33:24] <MootPoot> emmeka: why does nobody care - even from the book people
[22:33:32] <MootPoot> it is because they're suckered into it
[22:33:35] <SummerSkies> but after giving it even the smallest amount of thought yeah that's exactly what it is
[22:33:37] <SummerSkies> i wont do it 
[22:33:46] <SummerSkies> emmeka: the one curiosity I have, are youtube videos fine
[22:33:50] * Aurora_v_kosmose owo
[22:33:54] <SummerSkies> as long as they aren't whole episodes
[22:34:27] <SummerSkies> bceause one i do much more regularly than link to sites is link to youtube videos of my favorite fights and scenes
[22:34:31] <emmeka> MootPoot you seem to be under the impression that the price of goods is determined by the cost of their production. foolish boy. the market doesn't believe in such sensible things.
[22:34:44] <MootPoot> but- but 
[22:34:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Direct information sharing that could put ##anime or Libera at risk must be taken elsewhere. Commenting on information from such sharing is perfectly fine though.
[22:34:55] <MootPoot> its not even like making hardcover is a monoply or something
[22:34:57] <MootPoot> or unique
[22:35:02] <MootPoot> its just a commodity
[22:35:21] <emmeka> SummerSkies yeah, that's fine. Unless it's like one of those really terrible whole episode rips or whatever. There are actually some legitimate whole length releases on youtube, though
[22:35:22] <MootPoot> like, I get if only one or a few companies made hardcover
[22:35:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Hardcovers used to be less drastically differently priced from softcovers.
[22:35:44] <emmeka> iirc Nozomi Entertainment puts a bunch of the classics they license up on Youtube. You can watch all of Revolutionary Girl Utena on their channel.
[22:35:55] <SummerSkies> alright the rules are more clear now
[22:36:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And I can tell that it does make a difference when you commute a lot with books. I remember the difference between carrying a softcover and a hardcover in a backpack for the dark beforedays prior to the internet
[22:36:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> One got a lot more torn-up unless you took a lot of annoying precautions.
[22:36:37] * MootPoot has PTSD of carrying 8 hardcovers to class every day
[22:36:40] <MootPoot> fuck that
[22:36:44] <MootPoot> boomer shit
[22:36:55] <MootPoot> was in the age of tablets too mind - and we only used like 10% of the whole book
[22:37:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Yeah, that is also something I found completely egregious even when it was normal. Why doesn't the school stock enough (+ extra in case of trouble) books locally?
[22:37:23] <emmeka> MootPoot I'm still mad that this one US publisher licensed Hourou Musuko, an absolutely fantastic manga, and then tried to release is exclusively as a premium hardcover that they charged like $40 a volume for.
[22:37:27] <emmeka> so it didn't sell enough
[22:37:29] <emmeka> so they dropped it
[22:37:37] <emmeka> and now it languishes in licensing hell
[22:37:41] <MootPoot> trying to milk that uber otaku money
[22:37:59] <MootPoot> its like those japanese radios
[22:37:59] <ButterNoodle> *otaku milk
[22:38:01] <MootPoot> Futaba 
[22:38:06] <MootPoot> fucking 800 bucks or someth
[22:38:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> In the age of cheap-ish netbooks, mandating hardcovers or for-profit books for schooling purposes is inexcusable.

[22:39:07] <emmeka> Aurora_v_kosmose unfortunately where paperless textbooks do get implemented, schools rarely seem to have the foresight to like, ensure students actually have devices to access them
[22:39:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> emmeka: That's also incomprehensible.
[22:39:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It just seems like a nauseating parade of incompetence.
[22:40:07] <MootPoot> my last HS was okay, although we werent allowed to use our own computers
[22:40:12] <MootPoot> and instead those shitty chromebooks
[22:40:18] <MootPoot> which worked, I guess
[22:40:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bleh.
[22:40:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Proprietary software.
[22:40:42] <MootPoot> they need somebody to blame if it breaks
[22:40:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There are companies that do FOSS support.
[22:41:01] <MootPoot> that being said, most schools here do use moodle
[22:41:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's literally Red Hat's entire business model.
[22:41:03] <MootPoot> which is FOSS
[22:41:36] <Bco1981> what's the foss?
[22:41:43] <emmeka> I propose a revolutionary new school curriculum. starting from middle school, all children are given a free PC, but with no software license and told to figure out how to install linux on it
[22:41:57] <emmeka> give it until 7th grade before half the class is like "btw I use Arch"
[22:42:05] <MootPoot> LOL
[22:42:07] <S_T_A_N> SummerSkies, 86 is 🔥
[22:42:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> emmeka: No, at least provide explanation documentation.
[22:42:14] <MootPoot> emmeka: you highly overestimate them
[22:42:27] <MootPoot> 90% of the kids AND the teachers will just not do anything
[22:42:30] <MootPoot> and use their phones instead
[22:42:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Those magazines/journals for computing enthusiasts included both install CDs & documentation.
[22:42:40] <emmeka> also, ban smartphones.
[22:42:57] <MootPoot> if you do have that one kid, he'll either kepe the knowledge for pussy or go around touting it like he's daddy arch

[22:44:30] <MootPoot> emmeka: that's still too much
[22:44:46] <MootPoot> the best you can probably do is use lubuntu or something preinstalled
[22:44:49] <emmeka> MootPoot then you take away their smartphones
[22:44:49] <MootPoot> get them started there
[22:44:53] <emmeka> then they will sink or swim
[22:45:02] <MootPoot> emmeka: they'll start just throwing shit and talking to each other
[22:45:14] <emmeka> and maybe 5% will succeed. but then those 5% teach another 10%, who teach 90%, and then you kick back

[22:45:19] <MootPoot> emmeka: will?
[22:45:22] <MootPoot> nah
[22:45:45] <MootPoot> out of those 5%, 4% will hide their knowledge, keeping it to themselves for better marks
[22:46:00] <MootPoot> 1% might share , but only to get social cred and to the girls 
[22:46:06] <emmeka> kids are pretty good at figuring things out when it is absolutely necessary for playing videogames

[22:47:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> eww, don't.
[22:47:06] <MootPoot> kids these days dont even remember what CS is tbh
[22:47:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> DOS is generally terrible as an OS>
[22:47:31] <emmeka> Bco1981 hey, it worked for me. I learned how to do DOS shit on Windows ME when I was given an old DOS copy of the original Jazz Jackrabbit
[22:47:40] <emmeka> because ME was still DOS-based, you could boot it into DOS mode
[22:47:51] <Bco1981> yeah it was.
[22:48:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Networking & other multi-tasking emulation were horrible hacks at best.
[22:48:21] <Bco1981> i extracted the dos from that and made a dos 7.10 install cd
[22:48:32] <Bco1981> multitasking...
[22:48:37] <Bco1981> you don't do that in dos
[22:48:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bco1981: Yes, there were ways to emulate it.

[22:49:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I said emulation for a reason.
[22:49:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And even then it's a horrible hack.
[22:49:34] <MootPoot> even though  the topic has changed, I still am offended by the price of hardcovers
[22:49:56] <Bco1981> hardcovers ? is that something new for daki's ?
[22:49:56] <emmeka> Bco1981 wouldn't it be better to give them a linux install with no desktop environment installed
[22:50:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bco1981: When they crust up
[22:50:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (lol)
[22:50:14] <emmeka> take away the computer whenever they install gnome, scrub all their videogame save files, hand it back
[22:50:15] <Bco1981> emmeka: then they wouldn'y be able to game at all
[22:50:17] <emmeka> tell them to try again
[22:50:31] <Bco1981> Aurora_v_kosmose: lol ... ew...
[22:50:40] <MootPoot> emmeka, Aurora_v_kosmose do you get more linux cred if you have a softcover or hardcover book of nothing but printed manpages
[22:51:01] <Bco1981> emmeka: linux... my kids don't have that kind of patience

[22:52:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Eh, I'd say it matters much less on that level than if you have interesting reference manuals 
[22:52:06] <MootPoot> they just go do something else
[22:52:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> "The Linux Programming Interface" is one.
[22:52:51] <MootPoot> theyd even go to the point of just talking to each other instead of doing the computer crap
[22:53:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Ah yes, TSR, that's what the DOS stuff was called.
[22:53:10] <SummerSkies> i will forever be proud of nintendo for making linux
[22:53:10] <emmeka> MootPoot that sounds good too
[22:53:11] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: very few books deserve to be printed, and even less in hardcover
[22:53:15] <MootPoot> imo
[22:53:16] *** Joins: Itaru (~Itaru@ro2.flokinet.is)
[22:53:21] <emmeka> are you suggesting kids would voluntarily opt for less screen time?
[22:53:27] <emmeka> have you interacted with children
[22:53:30] <MootPoot> yes
[22:53:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: These days with computers being literally cheaper than some hardcover books , true.
[22:53:45] <MootPoot> the reason why they do screen time is because its addictive and designed that way
[22:53:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (Fucking uni manuals...)
[22:53:57] <MootPoot> staring at a black screen with a blinking cursor is not addictive
[22:54:01] <MootPoot> its boring
[22:54:15] <emmeka> and yet, there was pong
[22:54:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I can get a functional SBC-based system with keyboard & mini monitor for cheaper than one of my maths textbooks.
[22:54:30] <emmeka> look a whole generation of people survived trying to boot games on a Commodore 64 which was cryptic and often unuseable, and had boot times that could last 20 minutes or more.
[22:54:35] <MootPoot> emmeka: and how many people played pong rather then doing other stuff
[22:54:38] <emmeka> the kids will be fine. teach them the hard shit.
[22:54:58] <MootPoot> whole generation ? you mean the small subgroups of shut-ins
[22:55:04] <MootPoot> and the rest are still on the "how do I computer" phase
[22:55:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Among books that should be printed are those that contain useful reference for when your computer isn't functional.
[22:55:21] <MootPoot> the only books that should be printed are those that ^
[22:55:23] <MootPoot> OR
[22:55:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Such as "how the fuck does grub command line work" (not an actual title)
[22:55:29] <MootPoot> have value every time you look at them
[22:56:00] <MootPoot> or you think "that was a good book" every time 
[22:56:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Of course, the issue of accessibility is one that matters though.
[22:56:20] <MootPoot> although the solution to that is just get another computer really
[22:56:30] <MootPoot> the solution to all of arch's problem is to use another computer
[22:56:31] <MootPoot> lol
[22:56:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: That requires you to be able to afford one.
[22:56:50] <emmeka> I like my books on dead trees, still
[22:57:00] <MootPoot> with the prices these days, that isen't a high ask
[22:57:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I like that dead-tree books can be had for cheap when 2nd-hand.
[22:57:12] <emmeka> I read a lot digitally too. but when I really care about something, I get it on dead tree.
[22:57:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Digital books, if they can't be found on the high seas, tend to be ridiculously overpriced.
[22:57:19] * MootPoot points at a surplus office dell PC with a quad core i5 and 8gb of ram for 50 bucks 
[22:57:28] <emmeka> why? because it is owned. it can be resold. it is free.
[22:57:37] <emmeka> digital releases are with very few exceptions, not.
[22:57:39] <MootPoot> NFT books
[22:57:43] * MootPoot vomits
[22:57:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: How much do you want to bet they'll charge more than thrice the computer's value in shipping cost if I try to order it?
[22:58:09] <MootPoot> thrice? idk what its like for you there, but shipping for that box where I live is like 20 bucks on top
[22:58:17] <MootPoot> 70 bucks all in for a working secondary PC
[22:58:28] <emmeka> Aurora_v_kosmose did I ever tell you that Viz decided to experiment with zero-DRM digital releases for some of their manga imprints? For some reason their first choice for this was their BL label.
[22:58:30] <MootPoot> that's like 3 printed books
[22:58:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm suggesting that such sales are very temporary and that you must actively be on the lookout for them in my country.
[22:58:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And that buying one from USA to my country requires international shipping
[22:58:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Which is always expensive.
[22:58:50] <emmeka> but when you buy manga from their BL label, they just like, give you a .cbz
[22:58:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Even for something as light as a letter.
[22:59:02] <emmeka> no DRM, no strings attached, buy and get file
[22:59:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> emmeka: huh, neat
[22:59:08] <MootPoot> emmeka: even with NAFTA I wonder why the shipping companies from the US fuck us in the ass every time we want something
[22:59:24] <emmeka> there is no NAFTA now
[22:59:33] <emmeka> we got screwed into an even worse agreement by Trump, remember
[22:59:39] <MootPoot> isen't that also called nafta?
[22:59:42] <emmeka> not that NAFTA benefitted us either
[22:59:46] <emmeka> no, USMCA
[23:00:01] <emmeka> which should show you where the priorities go. US, Mexico, and then Canada.
[23:01:10] <MootPoot> my keyboard is stuck in HK
[23:01:12] <MootPoot> or china
[23:01:38] <MootPoot> because DHL thinks my name matches one of the potential ones on the untrusted parties list by the UN
[23:01:40] <MootPoot> apparently
[23:01:53] <MootPoot> :|
[23:02:54] <emmeka> Aurora_v_kosmose I checked, they give you both a .pdf and an .epub, they call it "DRM-free download-to-own". The label is SuBLime.
[23:02:59] <emmeka> things I wish would spread
[23:03:04] <MootPoot> subby :3
[23:03:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Indeed.
[23:03:24] <MootPoot> I have my interview in 3 hours
[23:03:34] <MootPoot> should I print out a C# cheat sheet and keep it behind 
[23:03:39] <MootPoot> so I can look at it
[23:03:40] <MootPoot> :3
[23:03:42] <MootPoot> lol
[23:04:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: That's silly @ untrusted. If you've already paid & they've got their money, trust doesn't matter.
[23:04:16] <MootPoot> paid?
[23:04:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> For the keyboard.
[23:04:26] <MootPoot> oh
[23:04:37] <MootPoot> yeah idk - they made me send in ID
[23:04:42] <emmeka> MootPoot damn, who'd have thunk that DHL of all companies is gonna go "this name is... too brown!!!"
[23:04:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Sounds more like a PII gathering op.
[23:05:22] <MootPoot> DHL did make me do it once before, same ID - although that was to pay customs for my oscillosocpe
[23:05:25] * emmeka whisks MootPoot's package off to the cavity search line at the airport
[23:05:40] <MootPoot> they already have my ID...even though they promised to delete it afterwards
[23:05:40] <MootPoot> so
[23:05:42] <MootPoot> idk
[23:05:49] <MootPoot> I live in a 5 eyes country anyways
[23:05:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> emmeka: They do it remotely now via chaturbate
[23:06:00] <MootPoot> if they wanted to spy on me, well
[23:06:22] <MootPoot> I already consider every single digital device I own compromised
[23:06:27] <MootPoot> including my arch system
[23:06:29] <MootPoot> all of it
[23:07:07] <MootPoot> NSA probably has 500 zero-days for linux they can use at a moments notice
[23:08:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That doesn't really matter, because Linux is a monolithic kernel and therefore should be considered a lost cause.
[23:08:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Security should be based on isolating secure hypervisors/OSes like seL4.
[23:08:32] <emmeka> I just have to live with the reality of it all, I was a card carrying member of a socialist organization and I've been detained by Homeland Security at the US border before, so I'm just on watchlists forever and that's how it goes
[23:08:33] * MootPoot will be pissed if they investigate my package and its damaged
[23:08:53] <emmeka> everything is comprimised and that's probably ok
[23:08:54] <MootPoot> emmeka: oh, I also get flagged every time I go over the states
[23:09:03] <omero> since when linux became monolithic?
[23:09:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm never setting foot in the US.
[23:09:08] <MootPoot> "Sir, we're gonna need you to step out of the line"
[23:09:19] * emmeka holds up a gradient from vanilla to cocoa at the border, squints
[23:09:21] <MootPoot> "sir, wait another hour for your security check to go through"
[23:09:28] <emmeka> yep, extra screening for that one sir
[23:09:40] <MootPoot> emmeka: funnily enough nobody else cares
[23:09:54] <MootPoot> germany, UK, saudi, malaysia, taiwan, whatever
[23:09:58] <MootPoot> only the US is like
[23:10:01] <MootPoot> no, this guy right here
[23:10:11] <MootPoot> lets take  him to our 'special room'
[23:10:16] <emmeka> same
[23:10:24] <emmeka> the annoying part is, I have residency rights in the US
[23:10:29] <Cryowolf> wait what's going on?
[23:10:35] <MootPoot> Cryowolf: sexual abuse
[23:10:37] <Cryowolf> what'd I miss?
[23:10:40] *** Joins: pcyo (~pcyo@user/pcyo)
[23:10:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> emmeka: No citizenship means you're still fucked though, no?
[23:10:44] <emmeka> I have a treaty right to cross the US border and they can't do jack shit about it, but yet still I am fucked every time
[23:12:02] <Cryowolf> Being a believer in socialism is fine, unless you're a RevCom or something then you're just nuts
[23:12:19] <emmeka> Cryowolf tell that to Homeland Security
[23:12:22] <emmeka> they disagree.
[23:13:23] <Cryowolf> I wholeheartedly disagree with socialism, but I think there are valid things within socialism to be used in a mixed system. I generally like Swedens system and we do use some systems born from socialism and then modified
[23:13:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Being a believer in failed capitalistic experiments is fine though. 
[23:13:56] <Cryowolf> if you can say "that's not real socialism" you can say "that's not real capitalism"
[23:14:27] <MootPoot> Cryowolf: how can you wholeheartedly disagree with it and then call some parts valid :3
[23:14:29] <Cryowolf> but that's not what I was asking here anyway and completely irrelevant, I think
[23:14:29] * MootPoot nitpicks
[23:14:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Which is not very useful because you can then make the claim the US isn't truly capitalistic either.
[23:15:11] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, because as a system I don't like it
[23:15:20] <emmeka> Aurora_v_kosmose as a part of the treaty in which diplomatic relations between Britain/Canada and the United States were established, free transit across the border and right of residence anywhere in North America is granted to anyone half-blood native or more. This remains in effect.
[23:15:34] <Cryowolf> but every system can have pieces you can take away from it and then modify to make them work
[23:15:37] <emmeka> they're called Jay Treaty rights
[23:15:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Thing is, capitalism isn't a stable system. It will inevitably collapse into monopolism & some form of central control the moment someone gains overwhelming influence.

[23:16:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> emmeka: Oh I see
[23:17:09] <emmeka> so, I have treaty rights to cross the US border and live there and work there, but Homeland Security doesn't care. They still always wanna have a nice chat.

[23:19:01] <MootPoot> I've found that being suggestive works

[23:20:02] <Cryowolf> I still don't get what's going on, can someone please explain? Why all this talk about socialism, capitalism and immigration chat rampage is going on?
[23:20:11] <emmeka> uhhhhhhh
[23:20:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: I mean, technically it's unsafe to eat.
[23:20:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But otherwise they're idiots.
[23:20:32] <MootPoot> Cryowolf: TLDR the USA dosen't like me
[23:20:36] <MootPoot> it all started from there
[23:20:43] <emmeka> Cryowolf MootPoot's package is being held because his name matched a terror watchlist or something, and somehow we devolved from there
[23:21:00] <Cryowolf> Oh I see
[23:21:08] <MootPoot> maybe they're scared of the loli LN's I was going to write with that keyboard
[23:21:09] <MootPoot> :3
[23:21:15] <Cryowolf> That's extremely odd
[23:21:21] <MootPoot> the keyboard is stronger then the pen
[23:22:35] <MootPoot> Keyboard>drawing tablet>pen>word>controller>pen+paper>pointy stick>pitchfork>gun
[23:22:38] <MootPoot> is that how it works?
[23:22:45] <Cryowolf> I mean in Sweden we do have a terror watchlist and we likely scan packages, have dogs sniff them or whatever for dangerous components before letting them in. But that's not if a name matches, that's if name, address, social security, date of birth etc matches
[23:23:03] <Cryowolf> like...a specific individual
[23:23:04] <emmeka> yeah well yankees gonna yank
[23:23:18] * MootPoot wonders if somebody has ever lead a politcal revolution with a drawing tablet 
[23:23:22] <emmeka> stupid US and its stupid border
[23:23:43] <MootPoot> maybe stone tablets...no
[23:23:45] <MootPoot> nvm
[23:23:45] <emmeka> we should build a wall! and make the Americans pay for it!
[23:23:56] <MootPoot> all we have is keyboard, pen and word
[23:23:56] <emmeka> a wall across Lake Superior
[23:24:04] <Cryowolf> everyone has a border and truthfully I wish Swedens was better. Not closed or shut or whatever, just better at keeping scum out and letting good people in
[23:24:32] <MootPoot> problem is that its a 50 shades of grey problem really
[23:24:39] <MootPoot> everyone is a potential mass murderer
[23:24:58] <MootPoot> with enough latex and leather, we can solve terrorism!

[23:30:00] <emmeka> Watergate is a hotel.
[23:30:37] <Cryowolf> Naming everything gate is incredibly unimaginative
[23:30:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I honestly have no idea why that's a thing.
[23:30:53] <emmeka> or, was it a hotel? or did the break in just get orchestrated from a hotel...
[23:31:09] <emmeka> anyway, it's a building. The watergate scandal is so named after the building where it took place
[23:31:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Fuck, the vast majority of those events & scandals don't involve any gates.
[23:31:20] <emmeka> neither did watergate, I guess

[23:37:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Like, I don't game on this keyboard, why in the world would I need those keys or the numpad?
[23:37:32] <Bco1981> wow
[23:37:36] <Vohveli> ASDW are on the left so clearly most keyboards are designed for left-handed people
[23:38:01] <Bco1981> reverse qwerty... oh fuck
[23:38:08] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, I think there are completely custimizable keyboards, where you can put any key anywhere as long as you can tetris them together
[23:38:27] <MootPoot> the problem for me is that I only use low profile boards
[23:38:32] <MootPoot> which greatly reduces my choice
[23:38:43] <MootPoot> if all I wanted was a left numpad I would have gotten a everest max
[23:39:01] <Cryowolf> or a minimal and bought a keypad
[23:39:14] <MootPoot> those dinky keypads dont stay in place
[23:39:18] <MootPoot> you can tape them to your desk but
[23:39:27] <MootPoot> then you cant move it
[23:39:58] <Cryowolf> Are you a smashtyper then? :P
[23:40:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ...thinking about it, why are there those keys on the right anyway since most people use the mouse on the right to aim?
[23:40:19] <MootPoot> legacy
[23:40:34] <MootPoot>  but I guess if you cared that much for gaming
[23:40:40] <MootPoot> you could jsut use those keypad things
[23:40:46] <Cryowolf> would be better with them on the left tbh, cause then they could be used like macros
[23:40:56] <Cryowolf> well instead of macros
[23:41:04] <Cryowolf> more keys
[23:41:15] <MootPoot> there are some mech ones but , they all lack SOME feature I want
[23:41:24] <MootPoot> either not low profile, not hot swappable, or not left handed
[23:41:38] <MootPoot> I sucked it up and chose a TKL and now I'll just be sad
[23:41:58] <Cryowolf> maybe you need to search in the ultra premium sector, they might have something for a fortune and a half
[23:42:20] <MootPoot> if I'm already in that market I might as well make my own
[23:42:24] <MootPoot> for like 500 or something
[23:43:43] <Cryowolf> unless you know how to program microchips, solder stuff and you order small components (which is almost impossible to get at a reasonable price during covid) to put together while you either buy or 3d print a case
[23:44:09] <MootPoot> I can do all of that
[23:44:24] <MootPoot> I just dont give THAT many fucks
[23:44:43] <MootPoot> oh wait
[23:44:55] <MootPoot> there is a mechanical low profile brown switch numpad...
[23:44:56] <MootPoot> actually
[23:44:58] <Cryowolf> If you're willing to pay 500 you do
[23:45:02] <MootPoot> HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
[23:45:23] <Cryowolf> you just don't have the energy or effort to put into it
[23:45:32] <Cryowolf> which I wouldn't eiher
[23:45:34] <Cryowolf> either*
[23:46:10] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: won't be long and you can get a rtx 3050
[23:46:29] <MootPoot> Peripad 303
[23:46:30] <MootPoot> not bad
[23:46:35] <MootPoot> a little expensive but
[23:46:40] <MootPoot> I wonder if I'll notice
[23:46:42] <Cryowolf> rtx 3050 isn't worth it for me
[23:47:03] <Bco1981> don't worry, it's already out of stock
[23:47:08] <Cryowolf> 3060ti or better
[23:47:48] <Cryowolf> I didn't know it was in stock yet
[23:47:57] <Bco1981> it's not
[23:48:15] <Bco1981> but it will be out of stock at launch day.

[23:49:23] <Cryowolf> yeah but considering I wouldn't buy 3060 cause it's not enough of an upgrade, 3060ti is though. But then 3050 certainly won't be
[23:49:35] <Cryowolf> unless of course it's ridiculously cheap, which we all know it won't be
