[22:26:44] <slaughter> I think the ideals and culture of devops - as opposed to the infra and SRE work - is damn near a bygone concept. Bummer.
[22:27:17] <Dus10> I think there has probably been too much emphasis on culture...
[22:27:21] <Dus10> not that it isn't a great idea
[22:27:42] <Dus10> I just think it has become overplayed
[22:27:46] <Dus10> and people are turned off by the discussion
[22:27:54] <Dus10> as if it is unauthentic
[22:28:02] <Dus10> not that it is... just the perception
[22:28:06] <slaughter> Hmm fair point yeah I'll give you that
[22:28:43] <slaughter> Just half the devops roles I'm talking to people about right now are just infra/SRE. I've been told "you wouldn't really work with the developers much if at all". What the fuck is the "dev" in the title for, then?
[22:29:08] <Dus10> ha, yep
[22:29:16] <slaughter> "We need someone with 5 years of AWS and IaC experience." followed by "Basic python scripting" in a "nice to have" section
[22:29:17] <Dus10> I have a customer... super interesting that we're even facing this...
[22:29:35] <Dus10> they created a holding company and bought a mortgage company
[22:29:47] <Dus10> they decided that they want an IT Services company
[22:30:02] <Dus10> so, they made a subsidiary and move the mortgage company's IT department there
[22:30:20] <Dus10> they hired us to ask how they can become an IT services company and compete with us
[22:30:23] <Dus10> essentially
[22:30:33] <Dus10> so, we started asking consultative questions....
[22:30:41] <Dus10> do you have any real developers?
[22:30:44] <Dus10> nope, they don't
[22:31:08] <Dus10> well, why do you think you're special then... if you find a challenge, don't you want a tool to help you with that challange?
[22:31:11] <Dus10> you need toolmakers
[22:31:19] <Dus10> deaf ears
[22:34:28] <slaughter> Jesus
[22:34:37] <slaughter> Start to finish that's a gross story
[22:35:21] <slaughter> 1. creating holding company 2. buying mortgage company 3. subsidiary of the holding company's mortgage company? 4. everything else
[22:35:28] <slaughter> 1 through 3 though, that's your sign
[22:43:23] <rawtaz> sloth. that's all i'm saying.
[22:45:52] <slaughter> Sloth is my main motivation. Technology exists to support and supplant human work. I exist to make that easier. Maybe one day in the utopia where no one works I'll regret vying for laziness, but in the meantime I'm gonna work real hard at it
[22:47:14] <rawtaz> i love that
[22:50:59] <Dus10> rawtaz: btw... I gave up on that tool I was going to try to use
[22:51:17] <Dus10> I got it working and didn't enjoy the results of the tool
[22:51:27] <Dus10> it looks visually compelling, but it wasn't accurate
[22:51:37] <Dus10> so... I am making my own tool

[23:14:53] <Dus10> graphing Terraform plan changes
[23:15:08] <Dus10> like "Terraform Rover"
[23:15:17] <Dus10> https://github.com/im2nguyen/rover
[23:15:19] <cluelessperson> how should I approach using ldap, especially in a self hosted context?
[23:15:41] <cluelessperson> and how can I tie it into x509 client certificates?
[23:18:36] <slaughter> Set it on fire and run screaming is how I'd do it
[23:19:14] <rawtaz> oh yeah that :)
[23:19:22] <rawtaz> Dus10: pleeeease tell me youre writing it in Go? :D
[23:19:40] <Dus10> I am :)
[23:19:47] <rawtaz> <3
[23:19:51] <Dus10> I started learning Go just to write this
[23:19:56] <rawtaz> cool
[23:20:01] <rawtaz> you know about cobra i guess?
[23:20:14] <rawtaz> and viper if oyu need config file support tied in with flags and cobra commands and args
[23:20:56] <Dus10> nope, I haven't gotten there yet
[23:21:03] <rawtaz> can be useful
[23:21:17] <rawtaz> that way you dont have to mess around with handling the cli and config much
