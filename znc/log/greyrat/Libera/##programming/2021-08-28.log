[00:25:48] <vdamewood> More printfs.
[00:26:05] <pyzozord> Hmm, what would I printf?
[00:26:06] <webNET4> best technique is to eliminate leak potential
[00:26:19] <jinsun> yes that means use rust
[00:26:44] <Izem> rewrite st in rust? :P
[00:26:52] <webNET4> no just remove dynamic allocations
[00:26:57] <causative> well if there's something you *suspect* might be leaking, you could put something in the constructor and destructor to count the number of objects
[00:27:01] <pyzozord> I noticed that memory usage grows only when charters change, so I suspect somewhere in run() or drawline() functions is the problem
[00:27:07] <causative> and make sure the count matches up to what you want

[03:21:36] <[itchyjunk]> also, why not use System.in directly if it's involved anyways
[03:22:06] <[itchyjunk]> I am guessing Scanner constructors are overloaded right?
[03:22:17] <[itchyjunk]> if i pass System.in, it triggers one constructor
[03:22:23] <beaky> yes Scanner can take in other Readable objects 
[03:22:26] <[itchyjunk]> and if i pass a file object, it triggers another one?
[03:22:38] <[itchyjunk]> ah that part makes sense
[03:22:52] <[itchyjunk]> i guess i had never thought about what i am passing
[03:22:57] <[itchyjunk]> and i generally pass variables
[03:23:04] <[itchyjunk]> so passing objects made me think..
[03:23:57] <[itchyjunk]> if some `public class Test { public Test(Obj) { }}` then hmm
[03:24:01] <beaky> System.in is one of those pervasive singleton objects (along with System.out another example)
[03:24:01] <jinsun> System.in and File objects probably have the same base class, so it doesn't even need to be overloaded

[03:31:53] <beaky> yes scanner is not very efficient in general (and also in the context of that geeksforgeeks website which is a really a resource for 'competitive programming') because it is a very general interface that mixes in io and parsing when you can instead separate or specialize both (like for example using BufferedReader alone or a specialized parser for your input format directly) and go more

[03:32:51] <[itchyjunk]> oh the mixing is what makes it slower?

[03:33:51] <quartz> I'm struggling with this leetcode question on reversing a linked list in Java. I'm trying to solve it iteratively.

I'm just not sure how to create the new linked list while iterating through the arraylist backwards.
[03:33:53] <beaky> not just the mixing but the fact it is a very general approach to io and parsing (c++ iostreams is similar and also slow)

[03:44:47] <jinsun> but if you do `test = new Test()` instead of `Test test = new Test()` then the old instance will be replaced with a new instance of Test, and the old one will be garbage collected later
[03:44:48] <beaky> for reversing a linked list the ArrayList is unnecessary you can reverse the linked list by starting from the empty list (i.e. null) and iteratively adding the head of the list-to-be-reversed to the head of the reversed list 
[03:45:11] <[itchyjunk]> ah yes
[03:45:16] <[itchyjunk]> dublicate use of variable
[03:45:16] <beaky> until the list to be reversed is empty (i.e. null)
[03:45:32] <[itchyjunk]> ohhhh
[03:46:38] <[itchyjunk]> i can't redefine int x to be String x within the same scope
[03:46:47] <[itchyjunk]> but i can have int x = 2; and x = 3
[03:46:49] <beaky> yes singleton is where object identity matters (all singleton objects must have the same identity, as opposed to only being a new instance with the same value but different identity)
[03:46:51] <[itchyjunk]> is the idea the same?

[16:08:02] <mrig> Stefan26: I think that the requirements of the kernel of an OS are such that they would use all the C part of the C++ language and have little need of anything else, all those parts that people recommend that you do not use in C++.
[16:09:07] <alycidyne> mrig: one unspoken requirement of an OS is that its runtime be as elementary as possible, which rules out languages like C++

[16:14:29] <alycidyne> mrig: no, they are, but they behave differently: C++ unions cannot be used for type punning, and reading from a member different from the one last written to is UB

[16:21:12] <alycidyne> Now that I think, why aren't OSes just collections of schedulers for devices which all offer a common interface?
[16:21:26] <arahael> alycidyne: I don't think there's a common interface.
[16:21:27] <phogg> alycidyne: probably because you could never get agreement on the interface
[16:21:47] <phogg> if you are a single vendor making all of your own hardware and an OS for it then it might be possible
[16:21:52] <arahael> Hell, even with serial devices alone, there's so much variation.
[16:21:59] <mrig> I think a higher order logic that is logic could assist there.
[16:22:30] <mrig> not a higher order logic because some one wants it that way, but because it is an emergent grammar.
[16:23:28] <phogg> the obvious solution is to add a layer of indirection
[16:23:40] <phogg> wrap each device in some firmware which provides a common interface!
[16:23:46] <alycidyne> arahael: the idea implicitly being that all activity in the system - even I/O - is represented via lightweight processes
[16:23:53] <arahael> phogg: That's essentially the idea behind l4linux, I think.
[16:24:01] <phogg> now you've just pushed your kernel problem out one layer and made it the business of device manufacturers, who will implement things as badly as ever

[17:46:42] <[itchyjunk]> bjs, i was hoping you wouldn't say that :(
[17:46:55] <[itchyjunk]> and there was some type of OOP dictionary that people mostly agree on
[17:47:02] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: at the end of the day lots of languages use the same term for mostly similar ideas
[17:47:06] <bjs> but not exactly the same thing
[17:47:56] <[itchyjunk]> then, would there be a dictionary type place for how java uses the words ? i am looking at the docs and it's nice but it's not in the dictionary format i can flip and look at
[17:47:58] <[itchyjunk]> if that makes sense
[17:48:29] <mrig> [itchyjunk]: just choose a standard to bear, and then march into battle with it.

[17:49:20] <arahael> [itchyjunk]: Actually the way you've got it is good, bad things happen when you pick up a language, and you assume that keywords such as "object", "variable", "class", or "interface" mean what is conventionally expected for them to mean.

[18:44:55] <[itchyjunk]> what about doubles and longs
[18:45:02] <[itchyjunk]> going between them
[18:45:21] <leduyquang753> long has the same number of bits as a double.
[18:45:43] <leduyquang753> double spends some bits for the exponent, so there will be some longs that can't be represented in double.
[18:46:03] <PlanckWalk> You can implicitly assign longs to double variables without error (eww), but not vice versa.
[18:46:27] <kobalt> but doubles are represented in special formats. long will also get promoted to double, I guess.
[18:47:57] <PlanckWalk> So basically you can implicitly convert byte->short->int->long->double, and int->float->double.
[18:48:18] <[itchyjunk]> i am adding a long fload and a double and i get a weird result

[19:59:58] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: On the other hand:  (2**65*1.0 + 2**12 + 1) - 2**65*1.0 == 0.0, because it converts to the double, then tries to add the same values as before.  This is an example of what is called accumulated floating point error, and can be a problem in some cases with trying to calculate an average of a large number of values that stretch across a long range.  You can introduce downward bias if you

[20:02:13] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: So basically, floating points give you a gigantic dynamic range of values going very very large and very very small, but trade off how many binary (or decimal) digits can be represented.  Therefore the integers are more precise under a very narrow range of integer-only values from 2**53+1 through 2**64-1
[20:03:54] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: "Narrow" in a dynamic scale sense.  In reality that's 18437736874454810623 values for which an unsigned long does better.  Just one is only sometimes working with values in that particular range.

[20:10:01] <vdamewood> Is this something that a lot of companies do for one reason or another?
[20:11:16] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: I will add that most programmers go through a phase of thinking floats/doubles have a design flaw.  They don't.  The rounding issues you see are actually a fundamental problem of mathematics with any finite representation of all possible values.  You must set limits on what can be represented, and all you can do is shift around where those limits manifest.  The standardized integer and 
[20:11:22] <InPhase> floating point approaches we use are actually very close to the best possible representations for most real world problems.  The only missing important representation without cpu support is a rationals type that stores fractions, but even these really quickly hit storage limits, it's just much harder to deal with and reason about.  But the rationals have some merit for certain limited cases.

[20:44:14] <InPhase> juliaEnv: 3D models are actually very hard to get certain types of information out of.  Our vision is mostly 2D, so you get snapshots at a time, and must navigate.

Every room will have a different width and length depending on how many objects it has to contain.When a room has enough objects, you should be allowed to put some "furniture" into the room to further separate objects by some ontology (i.e. house-like furniture that might be drawers, cabinets, etc.) and there you should find the objects. So, if a new person comes to the 3d model it'd be a house and with floors and

[23:40:34] <webNET4> it might be temporary, might not
[23:40:41] <blahboybaz> Regarding the first thing I asked about..  In C/C++ they have libraries which are part of the language. If you don't include the library you can't access it's functions (but it is a part of the language itself). In other lnaguages (like javascript) it may be called something else. 
[23:40:53] <newpy> webNET4, depends how I set up the container?

[23:47:06] <blahboybaz> I'm sorry, what I want to try to do (in js) seemed everwhelmingly complicated to figure out how to ask. I thought I could add to existing functions (those that are part of the js language).

[23:48:22] <[itchyjunk]> wouldn't the proper way be to inherit the class and add it to that class?

[23:49:03] <[itchyjunk]> is .prototype something like inheritence or anything else i know?
