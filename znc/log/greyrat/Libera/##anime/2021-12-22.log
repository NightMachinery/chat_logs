[03:59:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And as well all know, cuteness > gender
[03:59:34] <rolontloss> Aurora_v_kosmose, isnt that just ageism with extra steps
[03:59:45] <rolontloss> sorry people dont stay young?
[03:59:54] <Satin> :weird:
[04:00:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> rolontloss: Sort of, but ageism is really just discomfort with a chronic illness that isn't getting treated nor considered as an illness.
[04:00:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Senescence is an endemic chronic illness.
[04:00:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Not all animals are subject to it, but afaik all mammals are. That means something went wrong at some point.
[04:01:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> rolontloss: I also meant that hormonal expression will usually end-up catching up with femboys.
[04:01:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Unless they specifically take steps to prevent that.
[04:01:57] <rolontloss> Yeah but the idea that you secual desire to a person is dependant on age is very close to pedwhoShallnotbenamed
[04:02:18] <rolontloss> Are you also assuming that all femboys are between a cetain age?
[04:02:23] <rolontloss> *certain
[04:02:23] <isekaijin> rolontloss: I have no idea, you are the one who mentioned “futa” and “pizza” in one sentence.
[04:02:35] <isekaijin> rolontloss: So I assumed you were the expert on futa pizzas.

[04:02:45] <rolontloss> futa this pizza
[04:03:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> rolontloss: Not really. But usually women & men age differently, and the differences they might've lucked out on a having minimal expressions of might become more noticeable.
[04:03:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Past 20s for instance.
[04:03:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> i.e. 30+

[04:05:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Each decade past 20s tend to increase decline faster than the previous.
[04:05:16] <S_T_A_N> Bite my yellow pink cockbagel 
[04:05:20] <rolontloss> Aurora_v_kosmose, so what happens when you hit that age do you still only go for barely legal boys? I am tyring to make it mke sense I havent been on IRC in decades so if there is pedo shit going on here I can just nope elsewhere
[04:05:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> * accelerate
[04:06:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> rolontloss: I wouldn't say 20-30s is barely legal. But even then, as you age you simply resign yourself to the fact reality is horrible and you just have to deal with the decline of your own looks & others'.
[04:06:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Nevermind the health troubles that also start popping up.
[04:08:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Mind, makeup tends to do a decent job of covering the effects of decades of stress.

[04:10:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Aging gracefully only lasts for so long unless you won the genetic lottery.
[04:10:43] <rolontloss> nah I want to be 40 a a big bear
[04:11:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I most definitely didn't win.

[04:33:54] <rolontloss> KatrinValerie, my mom was fine the school was shitty
[04:34:02] <KatrinValerie> same
[04:34:07] <rolontloss> no matter the "problem" we were all shoved in the class
[04:34:07] <KatrinValerie> school was the worst
[04:34:23] <ButterNoodle> like a hay baler that could crush u into bits and spit out ur pieces in a square
[04:34:46] <ButterNoodle> ur a mower that could turn u into pink spray if u get sucked under it
[04:34:50] <KatrinValerie> I was forced to wear boy clothes and get a boy hair cut because of school
[04:34:54] <KatrinValerie> hated it
[04:35:16] <ButterNoodle> or any number of PTO drive shafts that were always looking to snag a piece of clothing and rip off an appendage
[04:35:28] <ButterNoodle> *made it out of that with all 10 fingers and 12 toes
[04:35:48] <rolontloss> KatrinValerie being middle school gay and you are the "weird" kid
[04:35:51] <rolontloss> its crazy
[04:36:01] <rolontloss> I was a walking target
[04:36:37] <ButterNoodle> yea imagine ur sisters friends putting u in girls dresses and putting makeup on u...
[04:37:35] <ButterNoodle> the things I had to endure to be around cute girls in their underwear
[04:37:44] <rolontloss> hol up
[04:38:05] <rolontloss> when did we change from mental trauma to queer mental trauma
[04:38:16] <ButterNoodle> about 5 lines up
[04:38:40] <rolontloss> cause I will never forget the time that my bother had a sleep over and we all took off our shirts but my dad was only concerned when I took off my shirt
[04:38:40] <ButterNoodle> I was still talking about farm work
[04:39:08] <rolontloss> like pulled me aside and told me it was gross for boys to do that
[04:39:08] <ButterNoodle> do you have cute nipples?
[04:39:13] <ButterNoodle> woah
[04:39:30] <ButterNoodle> strange
[04:39:37] <rolontloss> Yeah my dad knew I was gay
[04:39:42] <ButterNoodle> I use to walk around naked in my back yard
[04:39:47] <ButterNoodle> peeing on trees and shit

[04:42:52] <rolontloss> is that a new way of asking for a new bra?
[04:43:33] <ButterNoodle> I enjoy sniffing fresh panties tbh.. no other article of clothing contains a more diverse bouquet
[04:44:23] <rolontloss> am I a masc gay?
[04:44:36] <rolontloss> cause like that idea of panties is so off putting
[04:45:02] <KatrinValerie> rolontloss: my mom thought I was gay
[04:45:21] <KatrinValerie> turns out I was trans and well still pretty gay but the other way
[04:45:53] <rolontloss> Afab or amab?
[04:46:16] <KatrinValerie> I am amab
[04:46:17] <rolontloss> it doesnt matter jc
[04:46:38] <rolontloss> You are still a woman <3
[04:46:40] <KatrinValerie> It's probably a different experience
[04:47:14] <KatrinValerie> with shared difficulties
[04:47:32] <rolontloss> I am NB Masc presenting
[04:47:43] <rolontloss> I hate it when people call me big man
[04:48:05] <rolontloss> I am a ~theydy~ and will be treated as such
[04:48:07] <KatrinValerie> Am binary fem presenting as low effort fem
[04:49:14] <rolontloss> ( ͡°👅 ͡°)
[04:50:09] <KatrinValerie> though transition itself was far from being low effort, why do they have to make it so damned hard?
[04:50:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I can't get what I'd want so I don't even bother.
[04:50:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Why waste thousands on what I know will fail from the very start?
[04:51:12] <KatrinValerie> Aurora_v_kosmose: now I am interested, what is it that you desire but cannot get?
[04:51:17] <rolontloss> Aurora_v_kosmose, the adventure 
[04:51:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> KatrinValerie: A different frame.
[04:51:54] <rolontloss> Like body frame?
[04:52:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yes. Skeletal frame is wrong.
[04:52:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They don't fix that with current tech.
[04:52:29] <rolontloss> wait to be a cyborg
[04:52:33] <rolontloss> that is what I am holding out for
[04:52:34] <KatrinValerie> I was about to suggest
[04:52:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> rolontloss: That or give up, pretty much yes.
[04:52:58] <KatrinValerie> Though, there are possiblities
[04:53:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Functionally equivalent until it becomes feasible anyway.
[04:53:21] <rolontloss> y so dark?
[04:53:34] * rolontloss looks for the sun to come back out
[04:53:55] <KatrinValerie> Aurora_v_kosmose: and sometimes it's more the framing than the actual frame that matters
[04:53:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Nothing but snow, clouds and decaying khrushovki here.
[04:54:14] <rolontloss> ( ⚆ _ ⚆ )
[04:54:57] <rolontloss> well I can actually feel that
[04:55:06] <rolontloss> before I go asking all scared and stuff
[04:55:39] <rolontloss> my jaw is at a slant so I look like I got punched in the face my right side and made my left side longer
[04:56:10] <rolontloss> a cresant moon if you will 
[04:56:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's funny. I'm a few people'
[04:56:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> s goal. 
[04:56:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'd swap if I could y'know.
[04:57:51] <rolontloss> the grass isnt always greener on the other side
[04:58:12] <rolontloss> the trade off was I look good from only 1 angle and its myspace up
[04:58:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm basically a hikki anyway. I'd at least like to be able to like what I see in the mirror.
[04:58:49] <KatrinValerie> how do you see your frame without a frame of reference?
[04:59:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> KatrinValerie: The internet helps.

[07:01:19] <amigojapan> !c kythera
[07:01:20] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: Kythira is an island in Greece lying opposite the south-eastern tip of the Peloponnese peninsula. It is traditionally listed as one of the seven main Ionian Islands, although it is distant from the main group.
[07:01:50] <amigojapan> I don't get it roey

[07:59:48] <ImoutoBot> [title] Scientists unlock mysteries of world's oldest 'computer' - BBC News
[08:00:24] <Roey> And an hour-long documentary on it (REALLY good): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T1n7RjCMfQ
[08:00:31] <ImoutoBot> [youtube] Antikythera Mechanism. The 2'000 Year Old Computer. BBC, 2012 | Duration: 58 minutes, 42 seconds
[08:00:42] <Roey> this is a cool gadget that Greek sponge divers found in 1901
[08:00:59] <Roey> in what turned out to be an ancient Roman shipwreck, right off the coast of the island of Antikythera.
[08:01:08] <Roey> when they retrieved it (among statues, wooden planks, and a human femur),
[08:01:23] <Roey> they noticed there's a gear sticking out of it.
[08:01:35] <Nanobot> There's an old saying where I come from: A burden the hand is worth to end the bush. It means pulling weeds is important, even if you hand gets tired.
[08:01:35] <Roey> they X-rayed it in 1959 and found more gears
[08:01:53] <Roey> they started wondering, what could this thing have been used for?  Who made it? etc/
[08:02:01] <Roey> researchers and engineers started going through the logic of the whole thing.  It's fucking ingenious.
[08:02:11] <Roey> they did another X-ray scan on it, this time much more sophisticated and three-dimensional,
[08:02:22] <Roey> and found 37 gears in something that may have been the size of a shoe box.
[08:02:38] <Roey> From a Roman shipwreck carrying Greek stuff
[08:02:46] <Roey> from 2000 years ago.
[08:02:55] <Roey> anyway I'll skip to the end, it's a calendar-keeping device--world's first analogue computer--showing the postions of the classically-known planets (Mercury, Venus, the Moon, Earth, Mars and Jupiter), the dates/times of eclipses, the dates/times of Greek games (Olympics and others).
[08:03:02] <Roey> absolutely amazing stuff that completely up-ended our understanding of Greek technology
[08:03:34] <Roey> BBC made a documentary on it back in 2005 which is put together really well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q124C7W0WYA  <- what I posted above

[16:57:57] <bbear86> hi im back LUL
[16:58:00] <Sadale> darkbot081, yes. It's the kind of food that you have almost in every meal. It's the main part of the meal. For example, if you're having beef noodles, then the noodles is the staple food because it takes up the most space.
[16:58:03] <bbear86> might be lurking

[17:02:46] <darkwitch> amigojapan, yes. "The misnomer stems from a geographical error during World War I, when American soldiers stationed in Belgium believed they were situated in France (due to the fact that part of Belgium speaks French). When introduced to the delicacy, the soldiers nicknamed these fried potatoes ‘French fries’."

[18:10:15] <MootPoot> for me I usually use aliexpress
[18:10:18] <Sadale> MootPoot, Just so you know tho that LED is huge and it's meant to be used for public display. It isn't meant to be used for wearables.
[18:10:24] <MootPoot> but even at 25$ that's a bit much

[20:20:48] <omero> that would be cucchiaio

[20:28:42] <zoidberg> there's different interpretation to that, depends on which translation omero 
[20:28:50] <omero> we have a distinction here.
[20:29:04] <zoidberg> omero: some say, "in the middle of the journey of our life"

[20:32:48] <omero> even in italian schools, dante needs to be 'translated'
[20:33:10] <zoidberg> omero: do you think Dante is referring to his own midlife crisis in that?

[20:33:33] <omero> yes... he was an outcast at that time zoidberg
