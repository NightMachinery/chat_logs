[13:38:29] <Joanna> It would be easy to solve the problem of plastic trash. Just make the companies who make it responsible for recycling or disposing of it instead of externalizing the costs.
[13:39:55] <Joanna> If a piece of trash is found outside the nearest business that sells something involving that type of plastic can Pay for cleanup.
[13:41:14] <Joanna> The number of placeâ€™s with items in disposable plastic containers would go way down I bet.
[13:47:19] <Joanna> Plastic also does degrade over time.different types of plastic have different properties. Plastic is a rather generic term that refers to polymers. Kevlar is a very strong type of polymer. As plastics sit around they often start to degrade. Iâ€™ve seen oily residue seeping out of plastics. Iâ€™ve also seen plastic shopping bags crumble after a few years. Plastic left out in the sun will get brittle if it wasnâ€™t designed for sun
[13:55:14] <Joanna> ,121212b0b0b0Some plastics like polyvinylchloride have horrible smells because they are off gassing. Even plastics used for food like Polyethylene terephthalate can get awful smells as they decompose.
[13:56:19] <Joanna> ,121212In general plastics should be used sparingly they are brittle and unreliable.
[14:21:48] <CalimeroTeknik> Joanna, the most efficient way to give off heat, surprisingly enough, is to make the smoke go down then up; and you can make the upper part larger to reduce flow and give off maximum heat
[14:22:08] <CalimeroTeknik> coiling will not prevent the hottest gases to escape
[14:22:15] <CalimeroTeknik> from escaping*
[14:25:49] <CalimeroTeknik> you have to consider the fluid dynamics inside the pipe, and they're far from pretty parallel arrows as in a schoolbook schema :)

[15:54:30] <JimBuntu> Joanna, in the USA (in some places) fast food companies can be found responsible for trash from their business if it is found as litter. It doesn't do a ton of good, but it helped force some places to install more trash cans and to make sure they were emptied more regularly.
[15:59:18] <JimBuntu> As far as the convection air heater on the chimney I mentioned... it's a really old concept... you wrap most of the chimney with a larger duct... that duct has an opening near the floor (where the cold air is) and another opening near head/chest level or possibly higher... as the air inside the duct heats up, it moves up, drawing in fresh/colder air from the floor that then gets heated and escapes from the top
[15:59:20] <JimBuntu> of the duct.  It's just a way to add a little efficiency to the over-all set up.

[21:03:45] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: getting rid of farming using artificial irrigation certainly is more sustainable and also prevents soil salinization but the bigger problem is Americans love to turn the best farmland in valleys into suburbia and roads because itâ€™s flat.

[21:06:53] <Joanna> Convection heater wouldnâ€™t be such a good thing when itâ€™s summer though unless it can be closed off sometimes
[21:09:40] <JimBuntu> Yes, it can be closed off as easy as turning a wheel or dropping a flap.  If not using active cooling, then you would probably not want to run your heating stove in the summer... and would probably do like many do and have done in warm regions... cook outside.
[21:11:29] <JimBuntu> Many homes even had outdoor fireplaces attached to the same chimney... but outside so it didn't add heat to the home.  If you ever want to see a chimney mess, look at 18-19th century England, specifically London and other high population density areas... chimenys running in all kinds of directions.
[21:12:35] <JimBuntu> Note:  The mess is one of the reasons they employed young children as sweeps... it wasn't just an issue of fitting DOWN a chimney, it was being able to climb at various angles, as they often ran at angles to connect mant inputs to a single stack.
[21:12:48] <JimBuntu> s/mant/many
[21:15:53] <Joanna> The whole idea of needing sweeps means that the chimneys were badly designed and not burning things thoroughly...
[21:16:58] <Joanna> In the summer you can use solar stove
[21:18:37] <Joanna> I saw an exterior chimney at Monticello in the smokehouse . They didnâ€™t want slaves to steal the meat.
