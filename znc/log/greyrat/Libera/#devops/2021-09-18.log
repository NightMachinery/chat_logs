[16:42:25] <Dus10> I wouldn't quite state that Ansible is inherently idempotent
[16:42:31] <Dus10> it is intended to be
[16:43:07] <Dus10> in usage, there are many practices that are not really in the spirit of idempotency
[16:43:44] <Dus10> one could state these practices don't technically negate idempotency, but it isn't good
[16:43:56] <Dus10> Ansible usage tends to "tattoo" settings
[16:44:08] <Dus10> so if you simply remove a section of code, it isn't undone
[16:47:20] <Dus10> I think that while one could make a technical argument against my statement, it is more critical in a "configuration management" tool because it is making post-deployment changes that could persist for very long if there is no practice of immutability in the infrastructure (clearly, since it is post-deployment, it isn't strictly immutable anyhow, but certain system mandate some minimal post deployment changes).

[18:30:53] <rawtaz> the way to deal with that is to throw away and recreate resources when you edited your playbooks etc
[18:31:01] <rawtaz> or use Nix :)

[19:54:40] <Dus10> nah, the way I work with the roles that I have written is I create a defaults that captures the default values of the settings.  That way if you "unset" or remove the setting entirely, it reverts to default
[19:54:55] <Dus10> if you change it to some other setting, then it changes to the other setting
[19:55:09] <Dus10> it doesn't matter if it is Nix, this happens there, too
[19:55:39] <Dus10> my Ansible role where I did this is for Postfix
[19:56:04] <Dus10> there is a ton of using the `lineinfile` to modify configurations...
[19:56:05] <Dus10> so bad
[19:56:43] <Dus10> just make a template file and defaults
[19:56:50] <Dus10> that way it can be idempotent
