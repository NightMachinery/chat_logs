[04:34:01] <Me-me> I got one.
[04:34:34] <Me-me> Suppose one wishes to place typographical emphasis on a sentence, starting from the start and finishing at the end.
[04:35:03] <acdw> tomatoes do have a scent, a delicious scent
[04:35:04] <Me-me> Does one, then, italicise or bold the period at the end, or leave it blank? What of quotation marks around the sentence?
[04:35:47] <acdw> Me-me: Quotations aren't for emphasis. Had an argument with a highschool teacher about that one.
[04:35:59] <Me-me> And the period?
[04:36:01] <acdw> I would not italicize or bold the period, but I would include it in the quote.
[04:36:16] <acdw> However, other Englishes might not do the same.
[04:36:29] <furrykef> Any time a complete sentence is in bold or italics, you should do the same for the ending punctuation
[04:36:31] <acdw> IMO it'd be more "regular" to not include the period, but it does look better imo
[04:36:37] <Me-me> Aha! Conflict!
[04:36:55] <Me-me> I've gone back and forth on it, honestly.
[04:36:58] <acdw> furrykef hmmm I could see a complete sentence, perhaps.  Like the same rules as a parenthetical.
[04:37:10] <furrykef> Yes.
[04:37:22] <acdw> I like that :)
[04:37:45] <Me-me> I recognise that logic, certainly.
[04:37:51] <furrykef> If you have a bold phrase in a sentence followed by a comma, though, you shouldn't bold the comma if nothing after it is in bold. Same for italics
[04:37:59] <acdw> The real issue with quotes is they look bad "like this", withthe punctuation outside the quotes, because of the height of the quotes.
[04:38:06] <dTal> what does an italicized period look like?
[04:38:09] <acdw> Guillemets are better for that reason.
[04:38:16] <acdw> dTal: Pretty much like a regular period.
[04:38:30] <acdw> Of course, I'm not going to use guillemets in English prose, which is too bad.
[04:39:32] <furrykef> There are conflicting opinions about italicizing a ! or ? after a word in italics, even if the punctuation mark is not part of the italicized word or phrase, simply because it looks bad typographically otherwise
[04:39:50] <furrykef> "I would never do that!" vs. "I would never do that!"
[04:39:55] <dTal> I never include the punctuation in the quotes, unless it belongs there. I try and keep my prose context-free.
[04:40:22] <furrykef> How bad it looks depends on the font... in the font I'm using here on IRC (FixedSys), it doesn't look bad. But I've seen fonts where the result is not so good.
[04:41:11] <furrykef> (Your IRC client is probably using a different font. FixedSys isn't a popular choice these days.)
[04:41:20] <acdw> furrykef : It looks bad on my IRC with uh, DejaVu Sans Mono (I think)
[04:45:30] <Me-me> Based on that example, I definitely prefer italicising the exclamation point.
[04:45:41] <Me-me> So jarring otherwise.

[04:46:00] <furrykef> OTOH if it were bold then I definitely wouldn't bold the exclamation point

[04:48:05] <acdw> Obviously punctuation was a mistake
[04:52:41] <TimMc> Is it proper to bold the space after a bolded word? :-)

[04:57:14] <inhahe_> i wonder if they're wider
[04:57:23] <acdw> maybe ...
[04:57:27] <inhahe_> in a fixed width font, bold letters are wider

[06:00:07] <twb> TimMc: what, water?  I think that's just because it's cold it makes it harder to taste/smell

[08:54:46] <inhahe_> it's not clear i agree, but i'd guess the first thing

[08:56:57] <jensen> The speaker meant the former after he had added additional context, so yea, the guess is right.

[14:55:19] <panella32> the same magic that makes Ruby work when you don’t expect it to [work] can also make it very hard to track down bugs
[14:55:37] <twb> panella32: I hate that
[14:55:38] <panella32> Can you pls tell me why [work] has to be omitted?
[14:55:47] <twb> (The property, not the sentence)
[14:56:05] <panella32> twb Sorry I didn't get your mean.
[14:56:11] <panella32> What's the issue?
[14:56:12] <twb> panella32: don't worry, I was just kvetching about ruby
[14:56:28] <panella32> twb You don't like Ruby?!
[14:56:31] <twb> panella32: the word there is omitted because it's implied context from the previous clause
[14:56:48] <twb> It's more useful/obvious when the topic is longer
[14:57:53] <panella32> Can you pls refer me to a grammar topics which discusses this? This kind of omitting should be put under a grammatical subject.
[14:58:04] <twb> Sorry I'm trying to think of it but I'm right at the end of my wake cycle
[14:58:11] <twb> "elision" is wrong
[14:58:15] <panella32> no problem
[14:59:11] <twb> it's definitely not this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_context
[14:59:37] <twb> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_%28linguistics%29  possibly something in here
