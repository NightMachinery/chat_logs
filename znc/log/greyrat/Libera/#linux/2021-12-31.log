[01:11:33] <tirnanog> phogg: it isn't. for a start it would break on pathnames that contain $'\n' - intentionally or not intentionally - so it's less save. secondly, xargs does all kinds of weird shit unless the non-portable -0 option is specified. see the wooledge article on BadUtils for more information.
[01:11:51] <msiism> phogg: I see.
[01:12:08] <Thaurwylth> I've now subverted the problem, and I've installed a new system locally.

[01:12:10] <phogg> tirnanog: it doesn't have to, you just need two more switches (one for grep and one for xargs). I generally don't worry about that one.
[01:12:18] <tirnanog> phogg: then don't say it does the same thing.
[01:12:21] <Thaurwylth> Some of that Realtek driver stuff seems to be a real pain in the ass.
[01:12:43] <phogg> tirnanog: I'm just saying that find for recursion is pretty optional when grep can recurse itself.
[01:12:44] <derek-shnosh> akik: thanks, so in conjunction with.
[01:13:05] <tirnanog> phogg: correctness is more important then efficiency.
[01:13:11] <msiism> Well, I'd have use something like `find <sourcedir> -type f -name <nameglob> -exec <mv command>+`

[03:12:50] <tirnanog> Blondie101010: 'foo'\''bar' works because it's effectively three quoted things which constitute a single quote by virtue of being adjacent to one another. you have a quoted foo, a quoted \ and a quoted bar.

[03:38:52] <yolo> you can install packages without sudo, which is, interesting.
[03:39:17] <rascul> you can install stuff without sudo already
[03:39:27] <rascul> sometimes even with the distro's package manager
[03:39:30] <lastshell> pretty much you can do the same in any linux distro if you read the Makefile
[03:39:33] <yolo> python/node/golang/ruby/php can all install new packages as non-root, but I don't know how to do that with apt/rpm/snap

[12:41:03] <janko> :wigums I do read, but for example at the moment I am reading "How Linux works"
[12:41:14] <pnbeast> janko, that's more for you to say.  How much do you really want to learn about Linux?  Take a class - that's probably fastest and maybe even best, but it costs real money and real time.  The "free" way is to just install it and start using it.
[12:41:21] <labrador> tlcl?
[12:41:28] <labrador> thats free
[12:41:57] <pnbeast> janko, if you install it in a VM, are you actually going to use it, or will you switch back to your usual OS every time you run into a question or problem?  Again, that's for you to decide.
[12:42:07] <janko> :pnbeast I installed Ubuntu a year ago and now I feel comfortable with the terminal and even writing some simple bash scripts
[12:42:19] <janko> but I do not know how to head for the next level
[12:42:32] <Gaboradon> Hey guys, I'm looking for an offline web bookmarks manager solution, possibly something thrown up with utilities scripts, or maybe use a server database manager to simulate it ?
[12:43:01] <janko> :wigums any reccomendations?
[12:43:11] <Gaboradon> Thought about that for a long time, also, I would make the script to check periodically if the links are still ok and working.
[12:43:29] <pnbeast> janko, it depends on what the next level is for you.  Set up a service and actually use it - maybe a website, or even a dynamic one, with a database server.  Run a file server, figure out how to access it from another VM.  Don't run a mailserver.
[12:44:14] <pnbeast> Start learning C, if you can write shell scripts.  There are some very good free resources for it and ultimately you'd end up with something like Kerrisk's TLPI book.

[12:44:33] <janko> :pnbeast I dont know a thing about servers, where should I get started?
[12:44:42] <labrador> janko, start using arch. but dont blindly run through the install,read the arch wiki over hours for each command you type. you will learn that your os is not just a black box this way,but a pile of services
[12:45:01] <janko> regarding scripts, my problem is more that I know what project to tackle
[12:45:31] <janko> I wrote a timer for my status bar, but I do not know what to write next
[12:45:50] <labrador> cron autoupdater?
[12:45:52] <wigums> janko ill pm you a link
[12:45:52] <janko> :labrador I think I might just do that
[12:45:52] <pnbeast> janko, an educational (but maybe perilous) way to start would be to download the source for your choice of server, figure out how to compile it "from scratch" (if you can, these days...), and configure it from its defaults.  The safer way is to install the package for your distro and run it.

[17:06:00] <Nobrem> hexnewbie, let me ask you, just to be sure:   Is this mathematical proof that you just delivered,  that 38 min = 4x speed and 1 hour and 35 min = 10x speed?
[17:06:03] <hexnewbie> So if you all the time you meant one video of 38 minutes, and one video of 1 hour and 35 minutes (so far you've given all four possible combinations of 35/38), then 10x and 4x matches *exactly*

[18:53:15] <Sabinno> I'll also note that I have a relatively nonstandard configuration
[18:53:17] <MrElendig> if this is a non-f version of the cpu, try the onboard hdmi/dp out
[18:53:19] <Psi-Jack> UEFI updates fixed those issues.

[22:22:06] <ayecee> labrador: i guess you could calculate dpi for each screen, given its dimensions and resolution. however, fractional scaling is slow and the quality isn't great.
[22:22:24] <labrador> I guess yea we did not. But its just that I was able to solve that even though I used gnu/linux for the first time
[22:22:28] <labrador> But others might not

[23:25:22] <whatshisface> i'm not a huge fan of network manager if i'm being honest here... ie LACP bonds, it will bring one interface up at a time, and won't proceed until each interface is fully up. if you're using vPC on a Cisco Nexus with the default behavior of LACP suspend individual, the bond will never come up and will be suspended 100% of the time from network managers default behavior. at least, this was true the last time i touched it a year or so 
[23:26:15] <rascul> i determined years ago that networkmanager isn't worth the trouble
