[03:58:37] <I_Am_M00t> i think most people who call themselves "atheists" are technically agnostics
[03:59:54] <bittersweetsymph> I call myself agnostic
[04:00:07] <bittersweetsymph> What about you I_Am_M00t
[04:00:12] <I_Am_M00t> atheist
[04:00:27] <I_Am_M00t> mostly because i find it hipsterish to say "agnostic"
[04:00:35] <bittersweetsymph> I think there is some wisdom to be found in most religions though
[04:00:40] <I_Am_M00t> it's same same
[04:01:16] <bittersweetsymph> In a way some religious people were sort of philosophers teying to answer life's ethical questions
[04:01:28] <bittersweetsymph> Trying *
[04:01:37] <I_Am_M00t> yes, but then the started making political decisions based on outdated ideas
[04:01:44] <I_Am_M00t> they started*
[04:01:51] <bittersweetsymph> Yes there is a bit of that too
[04:02:15] <I_Am_M00t> so i wouldn't romanticize religion too much, it's by and large a way for large groups to organize around a common framework, and doesn't have much to do with ethics
[04:02:26] <I_Am_M00t> or metaphysics, etc
[04:02:56] <critr> atheism is just another faith. agnostics are the real skeptics.
[04:03:08] <assan> funny

[04:03:17] <assan> what you mean by that statement
[04:03:34] <I_Am_M00t> well, good for those rabbis/priests
[04:03:45] <assan> atheism is another faith?
[04:03:55] <bittersweetsymph> I see wisdom in their answers and analogies at times
[04:04:01] <assan> you clearly should google faith
[04:04:25] <assan> and then google atheism before you make such silly statements
[04:05:21] <critr> to say that "there is a god" or "there is no god" are both unprovable statements and can only be taken on faith. agnosticism is more pure pyrrhic skepticism, ie suspension of judgement.
[04:06:11] <assan> atheism is not just saying there's no god
[04:06:33] *** Joins: Adiemus (~Maranatha@p5b29381f.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[04:06:36] <critr> then atheism is the same as agnosticism?
[04:06:47] <assan> atheism is saying to save the praise and worship for yourself

[07:36:39] <critr> just pure conjecture on my part, amigojapan . ibut it would be great to find a physical test and metric for consciousness. then i could be studied rigorously as a normal part of nature.

[07:38:26] <amigojapan> critr: the closest thing we have is the touring test, but I bet many things that can't pass the touring test are conscious, like insects
[07:38:32] <amigojapan> And animals
[07:39:00] <amigojapan> So there is not yet a way to know
[07:39:26] <critr> the turing test isn't really rigorous. i mean a physical experiment.

[07:39:55] <evolv> amigojapan, not all religions particularly focus on deities

[07:40:29] <amigojapan> Hinduism had deities

[07:40:44] <evolv> not really
[07:40:49] <evolv> it depends on tradition
[07:40:55] <critr> the problem is to define consciousness. there are so many wackadoodle ideas about it that make it difficult to talk about.
[07:40:59] <amigojapan> gods
[07:41:01] <evolv> there was a major atheist Hindu tradition for awhile
[07:41:16] <evolv> and the Advaita school is nondualistic
[07:41:43] <evolv> so if all is God, then what?
[07:41:48] <amigojapan> I see evolv
[07:42:10] <amigojapan> evolv: that's pantheism no?
[07:42:45] <evolv> Monism
[07:43:28] <amigojapan> I don't think that monism is compatible with the abrahamic traditions
[07:45:12] <evolv> gnosticism, maybe
[07:45:24] <evolv> at least qualified nondualism
[07:45:48] <evolv> Christianity was already different enough from Judaism, gnosticism wouldn't really have changed that

[07:48:54] <evolv> amigojapan, good news! https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/MN/MN49.html
[07:48:55] <ro-bot-o> [url] MN 49 Brahma-nimantanika Sutta | The Brahmā Invitation | www.dhammatalks.org
[07:50:18] <evolv> there is a possibility that, because of the influence of Buddhism, the Japanese "baka" may have been influenced by this
[07:50:41] <evolv> although it could very well be a coincidence
[07:53:33] <amigojapan> Let me see evolv
[07:54:19] <evolv> this is the sutta where we learn this is no creator god. Baka Brahma (Brahma meaning God), was deluded into thinking he was the creator
[07:54:44] <amigojapan> evolv: baka is written as deer cow in Kanji
[07:55:24] <amigojapan> Sorry
[07:55:35] <amigojapan> Horse deer
[07:56:23] <amigojapan> It is common in many languages to call people animal names as an investor
[07:56:28] <evolv> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baka_(Japanese_word)
[07:56:28] <ro-bot-o> [url] Baka (Japanese word) - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[07:56:35] <amigojapan> Insult*
[07:56:51] <evolv> Second, the most linguistically sound etymology is that baka derives from a Sanskrit word meaning "fool".[2][4] According to the Japanese linguist and lexicographer Shinmura Izuru,[6] the Edo-period scholar Amano Sadakage (天野信景; 1663–1733) originally suggested that Japanese Buddhist priests coined the word baka from Sanskrit.[6] Modern reference works give two possible Sanskrit sources for the word, moha (transcribed 慕何) "foolish" and mahallak
[07:56:51] <evolv> a (摩訶羅) "stupid".[2][6][9] Sanskrit moha (मोह) means "bewilderment, loss of consciousness, delusion, folly" and comes from the root muh meaning "bewildered, perplexed, confused". Sanskrit mahallaka means "senile, feeble minded, stupid, decrepit" and comes from mūrkha (मूर्ख), meaning "dull, stupid, foolish, inexperienced; fool".[10]
[07:58:07] <amigojapan> Ateji. Perhaps
[08:00:27] <evolv> so a pretty strong possibility baka was derived from Buddhism
[08:01:44] <amigojapan> Possibly evolv
[08:02:02] <evolv> the first time I read this sutta, I laughed
[08:08:05] <amigojapan> evolv: even if it is ateji it is still possible that it has both meanings, and that the Kanji for animals was chosen to name that Buddhist thing
[08:10:34] <evolv> I wonder if the Chinese has the same pronunciation
[08:11:18] <evolv> because the Chinese means the animals, but may not be "baka"
[08:11:47] <evolv> hmm
[08:11:56] <evolv> the Chinese, the characters mean "red deer"

[08:21:30] <evolv> the word in Chinese may sound like other Sanskrit words for "foolish"

[08:28:29] <amigojapan> Ok
[08:28:39] <audrey> evolv: I´m unfortunately quite ignorant of non-Indo-European languages and etymologies.
[08:28:54] <amigojapan> What about Wiktionary? evolv
[08:30:54] <audrey> As a general rule, though, I am very suspicious of claims that Sanskrit was somehow a major influence on geographically and taxonomically different languages. (You hear this a lot from overzealous Indian scholars - who seem to want to believe Sanskrit was the first language ever to exist...)
[08:32:23] <audrey> How this applies to a specific term, I don´t know. Cantonese/Mandarin tend not to import words directly phonetically from Indo-European lexicon but rather use a process of agglutination.
[08:33:02] <evolv> amigojapan, what do you mean about Wiktionary?
[08:33:02] <audrey> Wiktionary is a good starting place for etymology research but I wouldn´t trust it. I´ve seen some howlers on Wiktionary before (and then, when I´ve tried to go in to correct them, had the changes *reverted* by clueless individuals).
[08:33:26] <audrey> evolv: Sorry, that´s the closest I can come to a contribution on this subject.

[08:37:48] <evolv> audrey, Sanskrit would make a lot of sense here
[08:39:31] <evolv> audrey, Mahayana uses the Sanskrit, Mahayana was derived first in China as Chan Buddhism
[08:40:14] <evolv> the Agamas were initially transcribed in Sanskrit, if I recall
[08:40:21] <evolv> and there were Chinese translations of that
[08:41:14] <evolv> the Agamas are the early Buddhist texts of an early Buddhist school. Theravada, the only living early Buddhist school left, retained Pali
[08:41:34] <evolv> now that is where things get interesting with Indian scholars and Sanskrit pride
[08:41:59] <evolv> Where Pali, or Prakrit derived languages, reside wrt Sanskrit is not certain
[08:42:31] <evolv> and there is so much linguistic incest
[08:42:41] <evolv> excuse me "admixture"
[08:43:31] <amigojapan> evolv: I could ask my Buddhist monk next time I see him
[08:43:40] <evolv> amigojapan, he wouldn't know :P
[08:43:52] <amigojapan> HMmm ok
[08:44:03] <evolv> well, he might, but not because he's a Buddhist monk
[08:44:16] <amigojapan> Alright
[08:44:44] <evolv> what tradition is he?
[08:44:54] <amigojapan> Shingon
[08:45:28] <evolv> oh, interesting
[08:45:37] <evolv> it's a Vajrayana tradition
[08:46:21] <amigojapan> Yeah
[08:48:09] <evolv> ohhhh, this must be one of those traditions I keep hearing about where the sacred texts were kept secret
[08:48:25] <evolv> a standard criticism by Theravada monks
[08:49:10] <evolv> sacred teachings*
[08:49:18] <evolv> since the texts weren't even written
[08:51:36] <evolv> hmm, apparently Vajrayana gave rise to two relatively recent Buddhist traditions that are known for being corrupt
[08:51:43] <plankster> youre all figments of my imagination
[08:51:48] <evolv> the New Kadampa Buddhism
[08:51:48] <evolv>  and Shambhala Buddhism

[08:53:10] <amigojapan> plankster: go hungry for a month. If it is all your imagination it does not matter
[08:53:20] <plankster> the food is real
[08:53:29] <plankster> its you all who are fake
[08:53:45] <plankster> im actually staring at a blank screen all day
[08:54:07] <evolv> you look like a food, plankster
[08:54:10] <audrey> plankster: Welcome to ##philosophy! Haven´t seen you around before.
[08:54:14] <evolv> maybe that's why you only think food is real

[09:00:10] <amigojapan> plankton: solipsism seems lonely
[09:01:16] <plankton> but talking about solipsism with imaginary strangers on the internet is fun
[09:01:41] <evolv> solipsism is what happens when you either love yourself too much, or hate yourself too much
[09:01:54] <amigojapan> Ok if you are not really a solipsist
[09:02:33] <evolv> which the latter makes sense
[09:02:35] <audrey> Nah, the guy is talking to us, definitely not a real solipsist.
[09:02:53] <evolv> monists are like, "man, not only are we God, but God really fucking hates himself"
[09:03:47] <evolv> if monism is true, does that mean whenever we have sex, we're just masturbating?
[09:03:54] <plankton> yes
[09:03:57] <plankton> and its hot
[09:04:11] <amigojapan> evolv: I think it seems either God or nature seems indifferent to human suffering
[09:04:25] <plankton> either that or it really gets off on it
[09:04:29] <evolv> amigojapan, well, we would be God
[09:04:38] <evolv> one and the same
[09:04:49] <evolv> at least in the Advaitin sense of monism
[09:05:49] <evolv> instead of everyone else being imaginary, it goes a step further in that you are also imaginary
[09:05:50] <amigojapan> I am not talking about monism evolv, I am talking about my point of view
[09:05:54] <evolv> oh
[09:06:17] <evolv> this is why Buddhism clicked with me

[09:11:07] <amigojapan> evolv: I don't think karma makes sense in with what we observe. Or at least it is not fair. If karma were fair, it should be immediate. So as if I punch you in the stomach then my stomach hurts. Then it would be fair and apparent
[09:11:20] <evolv> that's not how it works in Buddhism
[09:11:52] <evolv> I'll use the Pali since I don't practice Mahayana nor Vajrayana
[09:11:55] <amigojapan> How does it work?
[09:12:03] <evolv> Kamma (karma) are intentional actions
[09:12:13] <plankton> in buddhism its all about deferring to the afterlife anyway
[09:13:22] <evolv> whether something is good kamma or bad kamma is related to paticca samuppada
[09:13:36] <plankton> stop making up words
[09:13:48] <evolv> pattica samuppada (dependent co-arising, dependent origination, dependent arising)
[09:14:11] <evolv> pattica samuppada is the cause and effect that kamma relates to
[09:14:17] <evolv> there are 12 links
[09:14:26] <evolv> the first link starts with avijja (ignorance)
[09:15:49] <evolv> our kamma depends on our relationship in understanding anatta (not self), anicca (inconstance, impermanence), and dukkha (unsatisfactoriness, stress, suffering)
[09:16:15] <evolv> there isn't some cosmic tallying system
[09:17:09] <amigojapan> evolv: I don't think there is any cause and effect law besides those described by phisical laws
[09:17:29] <evolv> if you want to maintain a belief that you are a great person, that is bad kamma, that is a self-view and is subject to change. When you do something a great person wouldn't do, you'd feel awful (dukkha)
[09:18:50] <amigojapan> evolv: and even if there were, it is not apparent
[09:18:54] <evolv> when you hurt someone else, that is bad kamma, it is bad kamma because it's likely due to some self-view, greed, ill-will, etc. and you could be retaliated against, or later you'd realize that was wrong and feel intense guilt and shame
[09:19:31] <amigojapan> Yeah I don't believe in that evolv
[09:19:58] <evolv> why not?
[09:20:07] <evolv> it's bad kamma to have self-views
[09:20:15] <evolv> that, alone, is enough to cause suffering
[09:21:06] <amigojapan> evolv: cause I don't see a mechanism to enforce it
[09:21:31] <amigojapan> evolv: and life does not seem that fair
[09:21:57] <amigojapan> evolv: and it is not apparent
[09:22:04] <evolv> mechanisms to enforce what?
[09:22:16] <amigojapan> Karma
[09:22:34] <evolv> I think there is still misunderstanding
[09:22:40] <evolv> also, Buddhism isn't about life being fair
[09:23:06] <evolv> it's that there is suffering in life, but because suffering has a cause, there can be an end, and that there is a way to end it
[09:23:22] <evolv> this involves skillful actions
[09:23:52] <evolv> if someone hurts you, nothing can be done about what that other person did to you, it's done, that person said something mean or punched you
[09:23:59] <amigojapan> evolv: but you have not described a mechanism for karma to take place
[09:24:03] <evolv> however, your relationship with that moment is yours
[09:24:45] <evolv> if someone says horrible things to you, how you feel depends on the reasons why you let them affect you
[09:25:00] <evolv> this is all kamma
[09:25:56] <evolv> it's not a justice system
[09:26:47] <evolv> if you punched someone, why?
[09:26:58] <evolv> anger, probably. Do you feel good when you're angry?
[09:27:08] <evolv> Why were you angry?
[09:27:40] <amigojapan> evolv: how I feel when someone says horrible things to me has many different variables that affect it . Mainly how close that person is to me
[09:27:57] <evolv> why would that matter, though?
[09:28:18] <evolv> why does the level of closeness you have with someone matter?
[09:28:48] <amigojapan> evolv: cause I have a different closeness to people that are close to me than people a barely know. This is normal
[09:29:23] <evolv> ok, but why do their words hurt you?
[09:31:11] <amigojapan> evolv: hmm. They intend to hurt. I could do the same to someone else. Words so hurt
[09:31:29] <evolv> they intend to hurt, but why do you let them hurt you?
[09:31:39] <evolv> they're just words
[09:32:03] <amigojapan> evolv: you mean I should ignore them?
[09:32:25] <amigojapan> evolv: some words also make me feel good
[09:32:50] <amigojapan> I don't see why to go against my instinct
[09:32:57] <evolv> maybe, it depends on context. But if hurtful things were said to you, and they were because you made an unintentional, trivial mistake, then what value do they serve?
[09:33:16] <amigojapan> evolv: yelling can literally hurt the ears
[09:34:04] <evolv> Buddha taught techniques to deal with physical pain
[09:34:06] <amigojapan> Be painful I mean
[09:34:25] <evolv> physical pain, what is it really? It's something in the mind
[09:35:24] <evolv> Sometimes when you're really engrossed in something engaging, people yell at you for your attention and you literally can't hear them
[09:35:42] <evolv> sometimes people touch you and you literally can't feel them
[09:36:41] <evolv> so something about your attention determines how something is perceived, if perceived at all
[09:38:11] <amigojapan> evolv: but pain is there to let us know when we are in danger
[09:38:41] <evolv> in danger of what?
[09:39:02] <evolv> if you feel you are in danger, you've imposed a self-view
[09:39:14] *** Joins: SGautam (uid286066@ilkley.irccloud.com)
[09:39:15] <evolv> that self-view causes stress, suffering, because you fear for your life
[09:39:50] <evolv> and, consequently, you justify the experience of suffering, in the form of pain, as a result
[09:40:01] <amigojapan> evolv: well the normal example is if you accidentally touch something hot, your body will let you know by pain to avoid being damaged
[09:40:56] <evolv> so you think pain is that important to avoid burning your finger?
[09:41:16] <amigojapan> That is the main purpose I think
[09:41:42] <evolv> what if you did it anyway, you pull your finger off, and shrugged it off?
[09:42:10] <critr> that's one reason why lepers lose body parts... they keep banging them into things because they can't feel them.
[09:42:44] <amigojapan> evolv: you may die from bleeding
[09:43:08] <evolv> amigojapan, the question to ask yourself is how much life do you actually lose to some form of suffering because you're too afraid to let go?
[09:43:19] <amigojapan> evolv: and you would have one less appendage that helps you live
[09:44:02] <evolv> a life of avoiding pain, but getting into situations where you are getting pain, doesn't seem like living
[09:44:10] <evolv> it seems like waiting for life to get better
[09:44:12] <amigojapan> Don't know, if I know I may not be afraid evolv
[09:44:18] <critr> is it necesssary to keep living? if so, why?
[09:44:26] <evolv> but then you grow old, your body withers, then you die
[09:45:03] <evolv> it seems like there isn't a good justification to keep wanting pain if it isn't benefiting you
[09:45:19] <evolv> if you're getting yelled at all of the time, maybe it's time to just learn how to tune that out

[09:46:08] <evolv> or you walked into the house with your shoes on
[09:46:14] <evolv> big deal
[09:47:06] <amigojapan> evolv: pain probably also works as a social warning in relationships. But I agree that pain can be overwhelming and then it stops being useful
[09:47:46] <evolv> maybe a relationship isn't worthwhile if all you have to look forward to is the next time you're yelled at
[09:47:49] <amigojapan> evolv: we can use medicine to lower some kinds of pain
[09:48:52] <evolv> especially if you're being yelled at and you're not letting it get to you, and you're in more trouble for not feeling bad and get more punitive measures thrown at you
[09:49:47] <evolv> and if you're getting yelled at by your partner because you keep calling your partner, "stupid," all the time. Ok, maybe you'd stop getting yelled at if you didn't say mean things

[09:51:28] <evolv> you could, that's called compassion, and then that compassion allows you not to take those words personally
[09:51:31] <evolv> so you don't feel hurt
[09:51:47] <evolv> that's kamma

[09:56:05] <amigojapan> evolv: hunger is another kind of pain that helps you not starve
[09:57:36] <evolv> hunger is deceptive. Hunger could mean you need nourishment, but given our lifestyles, hunger is due to a habit of regularly eating too much, then missing an unnecessary meal
[09:57:43] <evolv> it doesn't take much food to sustain the body
[09:59:12] <amigojapan> evolv: I don't think I believe in "eating too much" I believe in eating the wrong thing
[09:59:35] <evolv> eating the wrong thing is eating too much of that thing

And we could still eat till we are not hungry. And those foods have become staples, which people don't want to give up
[10:07:14] <amigojapan> We would not have*

[10:09:10] <evolv> but, yes, people don't want to give up things
[10:09:16] <evolv> that's their kamma
[10:10:00] <evolv> it's not easy to give up things that we derive pleasure from, even though those things hurt us, even though we know those things hurt us
[10:10:14] <evolv> that isn't the same as saying it's impossible
[10:10:47] <amigojapan> evolv: my dad was a health freak and he would say "do you eat to live or do you live to eat?" I don't see much problem with eating more than we need to barely survive
[10:10:53] <evolv> it just depends on how tired you are of feeling stressed out, feeling unsatisfied, suffering
[10:11:43] <evolv> think of your desires like debts
[10:12:34] <evolv> you have to repay them at some point. Every TV show you enjoy will have a last episode
[10:13:21] <evolv> sure, you can rewatch the show, but you know you'll get bored. Then what? Find another show. How many times have you been frustrated when you can't find anything else entertaining that day?

[10:15:17] <amigojapan> Ungwelian: carbs turn into sugar
[10:15:21] <evolv> amigojapan, wasting time here means stressed out by frustration and boredom
[10:15:26] <evolv> by not getting what you desired
[10:15:52] <amigojapan> Ah ok evolv that happens often
[10:15:54] <evolv> however, ok, all the electronics are out, you're in a dark house, you can't really do anything
[10:16:14] <evolv> there is this thing you can do where you can sit down, close your eyes, be very still, and feel very satisfied
[10:16:17] <amigojapan> Yeah that's boring evolv
[10:16:22] <Ungwelian> amigojapan, sugar is also empty calories, while many carbs contain other nutrients and don't raise the blood sugar quite as rapidly.
[10:17:12] <evolv> there is a point when sufficient skill has been developed meditating where you enter first jhana, amigojapan. It's incredible
[10:17:18] <evolv> like getting high
[10:17:57] <amigojapan> Ungwelian: after my wife did the keto diet she was able to quit injecting insulin which she did for a long time
[10:18:07] <Ungwelian> amigojapan, keto is great :)
[10:18:52] <amigojapan> evolv: hmm. There are better things than being high
[10:18:55] <evolv> while progressing through jhanas, the high wears off, you get a refined joy, subtle. Eventually just feeling equanimity, then not really much at all, neither pleasure nor pain really

[10:23:13] <evolv> none of that is ridiculous somehow. What seems ridiculous to people is sitting down, doing nothing, and being content
[10:23:28] <evolv> that's how bizarre and fucked up our perspectives are
[10:24:15] <evolv> at minimum, it means we don't know how to enjoy ourselves without a cost
[10:27:13] <amigojapan> evolv: that seems hard
[10:27:24] <amigojapan> evolv: maybe during sleep
[10:27:41] <amigojapan> evolv: our mind seems simulation
[10:27:48] <amigojapan> Seeks
[10:28:13] <evolv> a lot of things are hard that we do anyway because we know it'll be fun once we get the skill
[10:28:35] <evolv> hand over a controller to someone who is 60 and has never played a video game before and see what happens
[10:29:05] <evolv> people run marathons for fun
[10:29:31] <evolv> that's hard, I wouldn't even want to train to do a 5K
[10:29:58] <evolv> you know how to code
[10:30:09] <amigojapan> 5 thousand metres?
[10:30:15] <amigojapan> I do
[10:30:17] <evolv> yeah
[10:30:39] <evolv> a lot of people find coding so hard they quit
[10:31:12] <amigojapan> I see. I do it on my free time
[10:31:24] <Ungwelian> evolv, have you noticed you're proselytizing?
[10:31:36] <evolv> yeah, but you already know how to sit, and you already know how to close your eyes
[10:32:09] <evolv> Ungwelian, yes, but I can get away with bugging amigojapan because we're buds
[10:32:17] <evolv> and married Asian women
[10:32:26] <evolv> who yell at us a lot
[10:32:29] <amigojapan> :)
[10:32:32] <evolv> :D
[10:33:23] <amigojapan> evolv: I forget, which country is your wife from?
[10:33:26] <evolv> India
[10:33:33] <amigojapan> Ah cool
[10:35:16] <evolv> except her sister and brother-in-law
[10:35:20] <evolv> who are totally not cool
[10:35:39] <evolv> but I went off about that in anime
[10:35:41] <amigojapan> Ouch
[10:36:02] <evolv> there has been a peace treaty made on Friday
[10:36:13] <amigojapan> Nice
[10:36:16] <evolv> eh
[10:37:00] <evolv> let's just say being around them puts my beliefs to the test
[10:37:52] <evolv> next time I refuse to do unreasonable free labor, there will be hell to pay, I'm sure
[10:38:42] <amigojapan> Gotcha. Also international marriages have many difficulties usually. But not impossible
[10:39:15] <evolv> it's really just her sister and brother-in-law
[10:39:24] <evolv> she and I get along fine. Her parents are great
[10:39:47] <evolv> I haven't met her family in India, but they seem pretty cool and look forward to seeing me when we can make the trip
[10:40:53] <evolv> the major issue we have is I cannot deal with the "there is only success or failure, and there can only be success no matter the costs" attitude
[10:40:57] <evolv> go go go go go
[10:41:27] <amigojapan> evolv: the relationship with my wife's family is almost non existent, we sometimes go to visit her father but she hates him, but she goes anyway
[10:42:12] <evolv> my relationship with her parents are limited because they still live in India and English, while they speak it, is not a language they're comfortable in
[10:42:17] <evolv> and Tamil is hard
[10:43:00] <evolv> but I got a good book on it and will work through it. Then I have to learn the actual dialect of Tamil they speak, which is considerably different
[10:43:09] <amigojapan> evolv: my mother in law moved far away after I called the police when she threatened me with asking her husband to beat me up. We have not talked to her in a decade
[10:43:26] <evolv> that's rough
[10:43:32] <amigojapan> Yup
[10:43:50] <evolv> I got pretty lucky
[10:43:58] <evolv> my situation is atypical
[10:43:59] <amigojapan> Good
[10:44:29] <evolv> my friend's mother (they're both from India) stopped speaking to her for years after marrying a white man
[10:45:13] <evolv> and our type of marriage is designated as a "love marriage"

[10:46:26] <amigojapan> evolv: my wife hates her parents anyway so it was positive in her mind
[10:47:30] <evolv> at least shitty parents is a cultural universal
[10:49:27] <amigojapan> evolv: not really. My wife take loved my parents. Unfortunately they both passed away :(

[15:16:21] <chatguy> 57C? wow that's hot
[15:17:01] <arryana> 57c has never been recorded on earth, so... no.
[15:17:19] <chatguy> no?
[15:20:12] <pussipupu> My sauna is on earth and it was 80°C there yesterday :p
[15:20:27] <chatguy> pls don't contradict arryana. she doesn't like it.
[15:20:50] <chatguy> pussipupu r u a filocypher?
[15:21:04] <chatguy> r u a fellow cypher?
[15:21:36] <arryana> don't speak for me.

[23:09:09] <Rashad> In other words, consciousness operates by the definition of life from above as much as any other.
[23:09:46] <brigand> .wt sacrifice
[23:09:47] <ro-bot-o> [wiktionary] sacrifice — noun: 1. The offering of anything to a god; a consecratory rite, 2. The destruction or surrender of anything for the sake of something else; the devotion of something desirable to something higher, or to a calling deemed more pressing — verb: 1. (trans., intransitive) To offer (something) as a gift to a deity, 2. (trans.) To give away (something valuable) to get at least a possibility of gaining something else of […]
[23:10:08] <Rashad> (For example, scratching your nose kills a certain amount of skin cells, and removing your appendix or even replacing your heart will dispense of cells)
[23:10:30] <Rashad> But consciousness will (generally) not dispense of itself.
[23:10:41] <Rashad> So in this regard it is very much like Neurons.
[23:10:56] <brigand> "sacrificing yourself" and "sacrificing parts of yourself you don't really need to survive for some more moments" are different i guess
[23:11:10] <Rashad> Yes absolutely.
[23:11:55] <Rashad> "Individual rights" are basically the codification of anti-self-sacrifice (here meaning individual consciousnesses).
[23:12:18] <Rashad> As for whether sacrificing yourself for your kids is anti-individual-rights or not, I think it depends.
[23:12:34] <Rashad> If there was no concept of responsibility then yes it will be a sacrifice.
[23:12:43] <Rashad> (and anti-individual-rights)
[23:13:18] <Rashad> But if you factor in (whether this is true or not) that if you choose to have kids then you also choose to be responsible for them, then it is not an infringement on individual rights.
[23:14:01] <Rashad> (In the same way that if you choose to be a policeman you also choose the risks involved).
[23:14:29] <Rashad> Of course the kids have to be under 18.
[23:14:56] <Rashad> Another problem is sacrificing yourself for your partner, which would definitely be against individual rights.
[23:15:27] <Rashad> In any case, the idea here is why consciousness exists.
[23:16:15] <Rashad> For the "biological revolution" of having life for the first time becoming sacrificial instead of self-interested, (i.e., by the evolution of animals), there needed to be a new unit of survival.
[23:16:43] <Rashad> If animals weren't self-interested they would not have been selected biologically, so there must be some part that is self-interested.
[23:17:07] <Rashad> We established Neurons and consciousness as two parts of an animal that fit the criteria of self-interested.
[23:17:44] <Rashad> We can also find that consciousness can dismiss of neurons, through say brain surgery.
[23:18:34] <Rashad> So consciousness might be one rank above Neurons on that matter.
[23:19:16] <Rashad> Therefor we can assume consciousness to be the candidate for the "unit of survival" -- i.e., the part that cannot be sacrificed and all other parts will have to sacrifice for.
[23:19:34] *** Quits: critr (~critr@user/critr) (Quit: .)
[23:20:31] <Rashad> Some animals have a fixed amount of cells across all the instances of the species, like Water Bears.
[23:20:51] <Rashad> All Water Bears have the same exact cell count, at least when they are fully grown.
[23:21:07] <Rashad> I don't know if these cells get replaced or not, what I remember is that the count doesn't change.
[23:21:39] <Rashad> If these types of animals do not replace their cells over time, they would not need to form a consciousness (according to this somewhat whacky theory of mine)
[23:22:33] <Rashad> But for those animals that shed cells all the time, there needed to be consciousness to perform the role that natural selection asks of the life form.

[23:23:29] <Rashad> But even then, consciousness could have been replaced by just the neurons.
[23:24:30] <Rashad> So perhaps one can make an argument that the unit of consciousness is the Neuron, or something else related to a Neuron (like a group of 4 neurons or a certain function that a Neuron performs).
[23:25:24] <Rashad> So while this doesn't say many new things about the relationship between Neurons and consciousness,

[23:29:07] <Rashad> If Neurons still exist when you are asleep or in a coma, then I guess you can't say they are units of consciousness, so it has to be a function they perform.

[23:30:34] <Rashad> First I define a concept. A concept is a mental integration of two or more objects (Ayn Rand).

[23:31:09] <Rashad> Meaning, a star in the night's sky and the sun get integrated or combined to form the concept "Star".
[23:31:50] <Rashad> In Object Oriented Programming, "distant_star" and "sun" would be instances or objects of "Star". (Star sun = new Star(...);)
[23:32:22] <Rashad> The method of concept formation (also from Ayn Rand) is: Find the properties common to all stars, then omit their values.
[23:32:53] <Rashad> In other words, all stars will have properties like distance from earth, mass, age, brightness, etc.
[23:33:53] <Rashad> The concept or class or type Star will list these properties, but omit any of their values. (it also has to list the unit of measurement, like meters or seconds, etc).
[23:34:06] <Rashad> Now, conceptual models.
[23:34:52] <Rashad> Physics has been a long story of figuring out the properties of objects to form a concept around them, then writing down laws that govern how these properties affect each other.
[23:35:26] <Rashad> For example, the brightness of a star decreases with the distance. (assumption made by me, not necessarily a physical reality).

[23:36:28] <Rashad> The study of properties as they change with time is called "dynamics".
[23:36:36] <Rashad> We have classical dynamics, and quantum dynamics.
[23:36:47] <Rashad> Now I talk about the nature of time.
[23:37:09] <Rashad> Is time a real property like mass or charge? My answer is no, it is not an absolute property but a relative one.
[23:37:12] <Rashad> Why?
[23:37:47] <Rashad> Imagine a universe consisting of only one electron. You will not be able to tell how old it is. (also applies to motion).
[23:38:32] <Rashad> Now consider a universe with two electrons. The two electrons will move away from each other, by virtue of the electric force.
[23:39:39] <Rashad> If you observe the distance between those two electrons to be `d`, and you knew how fast they are moving from each other, then you can calculate how much time it has passed since they were "at the same point".
[23:39:48] <Rashad> This is the big bang of the universe of the two electrons.

[23:44:20] <Rashad> I said earlier that a concept is a mental integration of two or more objects, but that is not exactly accurate.
[23:44:41] *** Joins: ___nick___ (~quassel@cpc68286-cdif17-2-0-cust533.5-1.cable.virginm.net)
[23:44:44] <Rashad> Again, according to Ayn Rand, it is more accurately the integration of two or more /percepts/.
[23:45:09] <Rashad> A percept is a perception of an object.
[23:45:31] <I_Am_M00t> > Ayn Rand
[23:45:34] <Rashad> I.e, what you experience when you look at the object.
[23:45:53] <Rashad> What your eye actually sees is individual photons, but you experience it as one object.
[23:46:46] <Rashad> The perceptual faculty is automatic -- you do not and cannot exert effort to see the photons as one object or not, you just see a tree, a bicycle, a human being, etc.
[23:47:29] <Rashad> So perceptions are integrations of sensations (or inputs for sense organs).
[23:48:02] <Rashad> If you rotate an ice cube, the ice cube will give different sensations, but the perception of it will not change.
[23:48:14] <Rashad> (you will not see it as another distinct object).
[23:48:29] <Rashad> However, perceptually, a cloud and an ice cube are very different.
[23:49:07] <Rashad> The conceptual faculty integrated different /percepts/, i.e., combine an ice cube and a cloud to form the concept H2O
[23:49:42] <Rashad> The difference being in the property of temperature. If temperature is within a certain range, you get the perception of ice. If it is at another, you get the perception of steam.
[23:50:09] <Rashad> So the question now is, is there a way to combine different /concepts/ to form an even higher level of integration?
[23:50:27] <Rashad> In Ayn Rand's theory, integration of concepts results in more and more concepts.
