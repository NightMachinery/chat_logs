[02:46:42] <irc_user> use*
[02:47:19] <irc_user> but j and k aren't great anyways, if you're writing enough stuff to wrap a line I'd just use search to jump between text, among other things.
[02:51:22] <irc_user> dre: I'm sure it's possible but I think it's hard because quotation marks don't have opening and closing characters like parenthesis do. Why do you want to jump between quotes?

[22:29:08] <ezzieyguywuf> if I use a command (in this case :ALEGoToDefinition) to jump to a new file, and then ctrl-t to jump back, is there a way to quickly go _back_ to the definition? I though ctrl-] would move "forward" in the stack but this looks for ctags
[22:29:32] <habamax> Ctrl-I
[22:29:45] <ezzieyguywuf> habamax: thanks!
[22:30:04] <ezzieyguywuf> hm, doesn't seem to work for me
[22:30:13] <habamax> Ctrl-O then
[22:30:31] <habamax> those to are to go through jumplist
[22:30:37] <habamax> s/to/two
[22:31:41] <ezzieyguywuf> habamax: ah hah, yes "jumplist" seems to be the search term I needed

[23:32:04] <ezzieyguywuf> is there a way to highlight words that fit a regex and _persist_ the highlight? i.e., something like :HighlightThings("myregex"), then when /someSearchTerm, I can see all the highlighted "someSearchTerm" _and_ the "myregex"
