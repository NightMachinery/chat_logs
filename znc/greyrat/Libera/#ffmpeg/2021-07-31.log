[01:34:09] <blerd> One thing that is interesting is the audio stream is slightly longer than the video stream
[01:34:20] <blerd> so I wonder if I need to pad it

[01:35:23] <blerd> but what about shorter video streams =/
[01:36:39] <mfwitten> blerd: The shorter video stream should simply have its last frame extended, I believe; but, in your case, the first video clip gets extended all the way through the audio of the next clip, right?

[01:41:40] <mfwitten> blerd: Well, for the last clip, it might be a stream that goes on forever

[03:36:59] <SnakesAndStuff> But what could cause ffmpeg to start lagging significantly behind (as in minutes) on segmenting a live stream?
[03:37:28] <SnakesAndStuff> I did not set it up to log the output, I need to do that for future use. But the streams recorded a few hours and died... I'm guessing that I had 2 streams recording to a USB drive and the write times finally caught up and ffmpeg gave up.
[03:38:04] <SnakesAndStuff> When I go back I plan on adding output logging as well as possibly checking the PID of the process and restarting as needed.
[03:56:23] <mfwitten> SnakesAndStuff: Memory leak and then swap thrashing and then the kernel kills it?

[04:28:18] <DeHackEd> 1 Hz? wtf?
[04:28:31] <furq> sembiance: it works ok here
[04:29:11] <sembiance> DeHackEd: It's converted from an amiga 8svx file

[04:31:28] <sembiance> furq: my goal is to convert into MP3. But `ffmpeg -i grind.wav out.mp3` and it just spins and spins, I stopped it after it was about 30MB of output
[04:31:45] <furq> well the file is supposedly 32 hours long
[04:31:52] <furq> it's going to take a while
[04:31:58] <sembiance> when played with mplayer it lasts about 32 seconds and stops
[04:32:14] <furq> fun
[04:33:09] <sembiance> original 8svx: https://telparia.com/sample01.ek___D.8svx
[04:35:00] <furq> yeah that doesn't work
[04:37:18] <sembiance> well, ffmpeg is outputting "Estimating duration from bitrate, this may be inaccurate" which is quite the understatement :)
[04:37:30] <furq> yeah it's detecting it as 1hz
[04:37:40] <furq> so that's probably why it ends up being 32 hours long
[04:37:52] <furq> i don't know enough about amiga formats to speculate why
[04:38:14] <sembiance> since mplayer plays it just fine, at the proper 32 seconds in duration, I'm tempted to figure out a way to just output the generated audio from mplayer into a 'good' wav file. sadly mencoder is no help here as that requires a video source rofl
[04:38:36] <furq> at a guess mplayer is just providing some default sample rate because it assumes 1hz must be wrong
[04:39:06] <sembiance> looks like it might be playing at 8000.00x
[04:41:12] <furq> what's this supposed to sound like
[04:42:39] <furq> i get a usable output with `ffmpeg -i sample01.ek___D.8svx -af asetrate=16574 -c:a pcm_u8 out.wav` but it just sounds like a sine wave
[04:43:39] <sembiance> if you change asetrate to 8000 you get the correct sound

[04:46:47] <furq> oh never mind i was playing the wrong file
[04:47:41] <sembiance> heh, yah. appears to be a fault in the original 8svx not having a rate set. my 8svx converter on my amiga converts to 1Hz WAV, but mplayer plays it back at 8000Hz. Just a lucky a guess I guess on mplayer's part.
[04:48:33] <sembiance> guess this is just a problem with these files that my converter will just have to come up with a sane way to deal with going forward. maybe checking the duration of the output WAV and if it's like >1 hour it probably converted wrong heh
[04:49:17] <sembiance> thanks for the help, especially that ffmpeg line you sent with the asetrate option. That'll be useful! thanks :)

[13:18:59] <Wulf> Hello. I recorded a video which I'm unable to playback. "ffmpeg -i VID_20210730_202611.mp4 -c copy foo.mkv" reports "[mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2 @ 0x55f7e30a5a00] moov atom not found". How can I fix this video?
[13:19:39] <JEEB> most likely your file got cut off when writing and an integral part of it which contains various required information never got written
[13:21:23] <Wulf> JEEB: file size is divisible by 2 but not by 4. "cut off when writing" should mean a multiple of a larger block size, right?
[13:21:30] <JEEB> #if you have a working video from the same camera or whatever with the exact same configuration etc, it might be save'able by something like https://github.com/anthwlock/untrunc/ (original @ https://github.com/ponchio/untrunc )
[13:21:40] <JEEB> Wulf: no, just cut off before the required structures were written
[13:21:56] <JEEB> like power being cut off, battery ending etc
[13:22:30] <Wulf> JEEB: that wasn't the case. I'll try untrunc!
[13:23:51] <JEEB> well, as far as I know FFmpeg supports reading valid MP4 files with both movie fragments (moof) as well as movie boxes (moov), and if it found neither the file is not normally open'able
[13:24:18] <Wulf> I recorded another short video; playback works on this one
[13:24:30] <JEEB> which means the writer got to properly finish up most likely
[13:25:39] <JEEB> you can only write a moof or moov after you have written everything it would refer to, which is why it generally is at the end of files
[13:26:05] <JEEB> you can then take that and rewrite the file in a second pass so that it is in the front, but there is no real way of writing it A->B
[13:26:17] <JEEB> (so that it is in the beginning)

[13:37:43] <Wulf> JEEB: "Mdat not found!" - "Failed recovering the file"
[13:37:58] <JEEB> mdat is the box that contains the actual media data
[13:39:41] <JEEB> there are tools to check what boxes if any you actually contain in the document, such as l-smash's boxdumper or so. but it does sound like your MP4 file lacks quite a lot of stuff :)
[13:40:14] <Wulf> okay, sounds like this will get too complicated
[13:40:29] <Wulf> It's not a super important video anyway
[13:40:50] <JEEB> well at the point where the media data box is missing too, then you're kind of screwed :)
[13:41:53] <Wulf> JEEB: is the important info missing at the start or end of my file?
[13:42:16] <JEEB> moov is generally at the end since it contains various offsets to earlier parts of the file

[20:14:29] <sembiance> furq: turns out the 8SVX file in question actually did specify 1Hz for the rate. My hunch is the '1' was actually used by some program to a lookup table which held 8000 which is what is sounds correct at.
[20:15:16] <sembiance> furq: also found some 8SVX files that had 0 specified for the rate. In both case (0 and 1) using 8000 instead causes them to convert correctly and sound proper. Ahh the joys of converting ancient file formats :)
