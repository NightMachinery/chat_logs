[15:37:41] <inwit> bremner, thank you for looking into the undo thing!! Great!!
[15:59:31] <inwit> I'm trying to filter out some tags from the notmuch-hello tag list using regex (do not show tags containing "_"). I've seen that I can use notmuch-hello-generate-tag-alist to get all the tags. But I can't seem to find a way to use a regex to filter out elements from an alist. Anyone knows?
[16:07:27] <inwit> I've tried `(assoc "*_*" (notmuch-hello-generate-tag-alist) 'string-match-p)` and `(assoc "_" (notmuch-hello-generate-tag-alist) 'cl-search)`, to no avail.
[16:12:19] <bremner> you need something like seq-filter I think
[16:15:37] <bremner> and then a (lambda) function that does the regex match you want to act as a predicate
[16:16:45] <inwit> I'm getting closer. I got to get one tag with `(assoc "^[^_]+$" (notmuch-hello-generate-tag-alist) (lambda (x regexp) (string-match-p regexp x)))`. Apparently there's a bug related: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/68172/how-to-match-the-car-of-alist-elements-with-a-regexp/68173#68173
[16:23:40] <bremner> try (seq-filter (lambda (x)   (not (seq-contains (car x)  "_"))) (notmuch-hello-generate-tag-alist))
[16:23:52] <bremner> you might need to "(require 'seq)"
[16:26:58] <bremner> you _could_ use regex here, but it seems like overkill
[16:29:07] <inwit> Thanks, bremner! But it doesn't really help: it returns all the elements, with and without "_".
[16:31:52] <inwit> I see, I need a third argument for seq-contains. I'm on it.
[16:39:05] <bremner> sorry, should be ?_ not "_"
[16:40:11] <bremner> (seq-filter (lambda (x) (not (seq-contains-p (car x)  ?: ))) (notmuch-hello-generate-tag-alist))
[16:40:28] <bremner> err, but not ?: that was for testing. replace with ?_
[16:42:08] <inwit> Cool. Now I have all the tags that I don't want to be shown! I'll try plugging that into hide-tags! Thanks!! :)

[20:09:40] <inwit> Now my problem is that I can't seem to feed that dynamic list into the notmuch-hello-insert-tags-section's hide-tags parameter... Of course, my list of excluded tags can't be populated after notmuch is running. :-?
[20:09:54] <inwit> I'm learning a lot, on the other hand... :D
[20:11:29] <bremner> I think you want to customize notmuch-hello-sections. I haven't thought about doing that dynamically though.
[20:13:07] <bremner> maybe write your own function, and put that in the variable
[20:13:19] <bremner> it's a list of functions, so it is pretty flexible
[20:17:03] *** Joins: nlhowell (~nlhowell@172.58.87.14)
[20:17:22] <inwit> I'll try that, yes. Or, finally, grab the list and hard-code it in my config file.
[20:17:46] <bremner> that also works.

[21:39:55] <inwit> bremner: I got it. I wrote my own version of notmuch-hello-insert-tags-section.
[21:41:02] <bremner> yeah. There might be a better way, but I guess this way gives you a sense of accomplishment :)
[21:42:41] <inwit> It does!! And it's not hardcoded, at least... :D
[21:43:23] <inwit> I don't know why the original function does not work if I pass it the list of tags... Must be something to do with the options mechanism, that I haven't studied yet.
[21:44:03] <bremner> although "edebug" is yet-another-thing, tracing through functions can help understand what is going on
[21:45:06] <inwit> Thanks for the hint. I'll check it out.
