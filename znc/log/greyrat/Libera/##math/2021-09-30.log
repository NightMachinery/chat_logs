[03:52:26] <Guest45> AimHere what was the issue in the example you wrote? You took the integral of x^2 + 5 and then differentiated that to again obtain the same function x^2 + 5
[03:52:51] <biberao> Guest45: he meant the Constant is never recovered i guess
[03:53:02] <biberao> you had a 5 you were stuck with a C
[03:53:40] <AimHere> Guest45, you asked for an example, that's an example.
[03:54:29] <AimHere> The issue is if you want to take the derivative of x^2 + 5, you get 2x and you integrate it again, you get x^2 + C, and you don't know what C is, so you haven't got your function back.

[04:05:12] <tusko> Well, when you take an anti-derivative -- (I mean seriously just pause and think about that word) -- you get back a whole family of functions as your solution.

[05:14:39] <Guest45> okay, so for Riemann integral...can we do the countable partition as cherim described?
[05:15:08] <cherim> Generally not, at least without carefully asserting stuff
[05:15:35] <Guest45> can you provide an example where if we do not carefully assert stuff, something breaks?
[05:16:02] <cherim> Say, there may be cases where integrals over [a_k, b_k] exist, the series is absolutely convergent, but int_a^b does not exist in Riemann sense
[05:17:00] <cherim> Maybe you can just define f(t) to be sqrt{n} on [1/(n+1), 1/n] and 0 at x=1/n for all positive integers n

[07:18:08] *** Quits: Mare (~Mare@71.196.251.141) (Quit: Connection closed)
[07:18:48] <somiaj> so you have (log(t), log(s)) = (x,y) some point on the graph and the average is increasing linearly
[07:20:38] <somiaj> I guess we can be more detailed, (log(t), log(s)) = (x, mx + b), and the goal is to write s in terms of t.
[07:21:34] <somiaj> oh they even give the slope, but that is beyond the point now. So x = e^t (though maybe 10^t, lets not worry about base)
[07:22:11] *** Quits: LiftLeft (~LiftLeft@172.98.92.26) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[07:22:41] <somiaj> Thus log(s) = me^t + b, or s = e^(me^t + b) = e^b * (e^(me^t)), thus s grows like a nested exponential with repsect to t
[07:23:23] <blueberrycrop> what's that type of math called?
[07:23:50] <somiaj> blueberrycrop: not sure if it has a name, but all I'm doing is algebra
[07:23:55] <horan> Hello thank you for the help, I am a little confused about "though maybe 10^t, lets not worry about base)"
[07:24:38] <blueberrycrop> somiaj ok algebra must be more vast than I thought
[07:24:40] <somiaj> blueberrycrop: but this appears in stats a lot, you often pick log scales for the axes, because then your data is in a straight line, and you can use linear regression to get an approximation of that line, and then work backwards to the original function.
[07:25:10] <blueberrycrop> wow, that's really smart.
[07:25:31] <somiaj> horan: I'm just stating that really in terms of the 'shape' you get, it doesn't matter what base of log we are using, to me log is base e, but I think log base 10 is common in graphs. Either way it isn't important in terms of the shape, just the actual values which we dont' have

[10:45:09] <kmh> Simplar, ABC is assumed to be a triangle though
[10:45:17] <Simplar> Yes
[10:45:33] <Simplar> There is a triangle ABC, and, according to the result of that task, if two angles of a triangle relate as 1:2, then if the opposite sides to these angles are a and b respectively, we can find the radius of a circumcircle of that triangle by the same formula that is used for the isosceles triangle

[12:46:06] <quarterback> is it true that mathematical methods which work for most physical systems ( like electric circuits) will fail for some physical systems which dont conform to mathmetical rules? I am referring to linear algebra.
[12:47:19] <W> "don't conform to mathematical rules" is nonsense, but certainly different aspects of physics require different mathematics
[12:48:06] <quarterback> Yes that what I meant. So the same mathematical approach wont work for different physical systems of the same type.
[12:48:06] <W> it's not that the mathematics "don't work" but that the data is best described by different kinds of mathematical equations
[12:48:47] <W> (which can have very different methods for analyzing them)
[12:49:43] <quarterback> Yes, the method has to be different for dealing with the electrical system if one mathematical method is invalid.
[12:55:18] <Vornicus> to be clear here - the mathematics is designed to model the physics; if it does not do so perfectly, the physics can do things that the mathematics says it cannot
[12:57:01] <Vornicus> more and more sophisticated models need to be deployed in order for the physics to be correctly handled in these situations.  Sometimes, the mathematical models become intractible because of this.
[12:57:29] <Vornicus> Sometimes it doesn't take terribly much for that to happen: the three body problem in orbital mechanics is one such thing.

[13:52:31] <mawk> I guess if you consider normalized polynomial the ambiguity goes away, the gcd is 1 if they're coprime

[14:04:23] <dila> this is the first step of the gcd. the next step divides  x  by  a  which is zero. the gcd is the first non-zero remainder, so the gcd is  a
[14:04:32] <dila> mawk: do you agree with this?
[14:04:39] <PlanckWalk> IF the constant is zero, then they might not be coprime :)
[14:05:00] <dila> a is non-zero
[14:08:28] <dila> on the other hand, if i divide through by the constant term and compute the gcd of the pair (x, 1 + (a^-1)x^2), then i get gcd=1

[16:55:42] <int-e> [itchyjunk]: you probably start with a successor function, which would be S(0) = 2*0 + 1, S(2*n + 1) = 2*n + 2, S(2*n + 2) = 2*S(n) + 1... at which point you realize that you probable need better notation for the 2n+1 and 2n+2 constructors.

Though you still have some work cut out for you when you define addition and multiplication for that... because ZFC requires you to jump through hoops with the axiom of replacement for inductive definitions.

[19:41:15] <dila> turns out not to be particuarly difficult. this is not the same as the fundemental theorem of algebra i think
[19:41:36] <dila> which is: a polynomial equation of degreen n has exactly n roots (in the complex numbers)
[19:42:35] <cherim> The question was about the proof of 1.2 by the imgur link above
[19:43:05] <cherim> But there is no more way to do a clean experiment, only bosspotato could participate in one
[19:43:11] <int-e> Yeah I think it relies on Theorem 1.1 then and it could be more explicit about where and how that theorem is used.
[19:43:15] <dila> if a polynomial of degree n has a root at a, then it is divisible by x-a. the result of the division reduces the degree by 1. by induction we eventually reach degree zero, so there can be no more (than n roots)
[19:44:31] <cherim> Yes, Theorem 1.1 doesn't even have any proof supplied (and doesn't need any). Again, there were no questions about 1.1. It was only mentioned to answer int-e's question on prior lemmas
[19:44:57] <dila> that might not strictly be induction by the way. i think induction means you go to infinity. this is just iterating the process and showing the iteration is finite
[19:45:25] <int-e> dila: So where exactly does that show that there aren't more than n roots?
[19:45:57] <dila> int-e: because removing each x-a factor drops the degree by 1

[19:48:27] <int-e> dila: So the missing step is... how does what you're doing relate to roots?
[19:49:21] <dila> i think this is the proof from my book, so it must be a case of restricting it to the domain that i am familiar with
[19:50:05] <dila> int-e: i noticed you picked 6, which makes Z/6Z a ring but not a field
[19:50:11] *** Quits: eck (~root@user/eck) (Client Quit)
[19:50:15] <dila> maybe it is a field restriction that is missing?
[19:50:17] <int-e> What happens when you solve (x-1)(x+1) = 0 in Z/6Z that doesn't happen in fields?
[19:50:29] *** Joins: eck (~root@user/eck)
[19:50:34] <cherim> What are the 4 roots or x^2-1 in Z/(6)?
[19:50:59] <dila> zero divisors, i suppose?
[19:51:17] <int-e> Ah, I messed up, should've used Z/15Z
[19:51:24] <int-e> 2, the odd prime.
[19:51:51] <int-e> Or I should've stuck with the example that I actually tested, which was x(x-1) = 0.
[19:52:09] <dila> i should go back and read about UFD and PID but i seem to have been able to continue without recapping

[19:52:42] <int-e> dila: anyway, yes, zero divisors
[19:52:57] <int-e> dila: so you can't conclude from p(x)(x-a) = 0 that x = a or p(x) = 0.
[19:53:23] <int-e> And that's the property that connects roots and factoring.
[19:53:34] <int-e> cherim: thanks btw
[19:53:50] <cherim> What happens with Z/(15)? :)
[19:54:15] <int-e> cherim: then you get all combinations of x = +/-1 (mod 3) and x = +/-1 (mod 5).
[19:54:23] <int-e> CRT at work
[19:54:44] <int-e> But I overlooked that x = +/-1 (mod 2) is only one case.

[22:48:59] <Z-module> FTA is entirely different
[22:49:24] <Z-module> In the thing I quoted, the poly might easly have *no* roots in S.
[22:49:33] <Z-module> The theorem is only about a max possible number of them.
[22:51:19] <Z-module> Also that fails dramatically sometimes when S is non-commutative even if S lacks zero-divisors. For example, over H (the real quaternions), x^2 + 1 has uncountably many roots.
