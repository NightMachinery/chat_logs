[02:03:20] <AMM> I'm aware, I asked about which options I should look at for improved quality for low bitrate opus
[02:03:46] <kepstin> In general you don't need to do anything, although if you're tuning for voice specifically, setting the "-application voip" option is good.
[02:04:57] <AMM> No, just arbitrary audio archival, just to have "something" after I remove the original files
[02:05:10] <kepstin> frame sizes about 20ms do improve encoding efficiency a bit but honestly not that much, and i think that only affects celt mode not silk/hybrid mode.
[02:07:31] <kepstin> the main thing you should do is just make sure you've got the latest version of libopus, since most of the low bitrate improvements come from encoder improvements they've made :)
[02:07:43] <kepstin> that said, there hasn't been any changes in a couple years, so you're probably good there
[02:07:56] <AMM> Good point to keep in mind
[02:08:24] <AMM> I got effed somewhat by an older ffmpeg version truncated ASS lines, so would've done that anyway
[02:08:28] <AMM> but it's worth repeating
[02:09:30] <kepstin> all the quality comparisons i know of about frame duration are comparing 20ms to shorter durations for really low latency audio, i don't actually know of anyone who's done comparisons for quality of longer duration frames.
[02:10:22] <kepstin> but if you're doing general audio, and offline encoding where latency isn't an issue, i don't see how setting longer frame duration (within the limits supported by the standard opus decoder) could hurt.
[02:10:27] <kepstin> i wouldn't touch any other options.
[02:11:18] <kepstin> you could also try asking in #opus (also libera.chat) to see if any of the devs have feedback
[02:12:31] <kepstin> ah, they have a note about it here: https://wiki.xiph.org/OpusFAQ#What_frame_size_should_I_use.3F that suggests avoiding longer frame sizes for file encoding :/
[02:14:52] <AMM> Yeah I guess I'll just trust on libopus being magic, and storage isn't so low I couldn't just 64k
[02:21:54] <kepstin> could always trial a subset of files with multiple encoding options so you can compare them before deciding on a final format.
[02:23:49] <furq> kepstin: 20ms is the default frame size anyway
[02:24:30] <furq> there's also -compression_level but i think that defaults to the maximum
[02:24:42] <AMM> It does
[02:25:03] <kepstin> yeah, all the defaults are for max quality of general audio at arbitrary bitrates with 20ms frames.
[02:25:12] <AMM> And I can't hear the difference between 20ms and 60ms, though there is one when inverting the tracks
[02:25:34] <AMM> I don't have golden ears, so safe bet is to just trust in 32k or go 64k because why not
[02:25:57] <kepstin> you could ABX the frame size change to see if there's any statistically noticable difference, but yeah
[02:26:27] <AMM> That's beyond me and my level of care here
[02:26:29] <furq> Unless operating at very low bitrates over RTP, there is no reason to use frame sizes above 20 ms, as those will have slightly lower quality for music encoding.
[02:26:32] <furq> according to xiph
[02:27:16] <kepstin> with very low bitrates with silk mode i think the longer frame sizes just reduce overhead through packing multiple silk frames into a single audio frame :/

[09:32:24] <mr_ab> basically, ... i'm doing something like ffmpeg -show_streams -show_format -print_format json $FILE already, .. i'd love, while it's already processing, to go ahead and scan the entire video input and let me use -show_frames with select=gt(scene, 0.4) ... but the only examples I can find are using lavfi like -f lavfi "movie=$FILE,select=gt(scene,0.4)"
[09:33:19] <mr_ab> it just yells at me if i try to combine these... not sure the secret sauce - or is it just not possible/lavfi is a bit of a hack and I need to invoke ffprobe twice?
[09:45:49] <kepstin> when you use ffprobe with -f lavfi, it sees the filter chain wrapper instead of the real input format of the file, so it can't access the underlying real input format to pull that information.
[09:46:47] <kepstin> (indeed, with -f lavfi there might be no underlying input format at all, if the filter chain generates synthetic video for example)
[09:47:16] <furq> unless you need -count_frames then ffprobe only reads the first 5M of the file anyway
[09:47:20] <furq> so it's not that big of a deal to call it twice

[21:40:48] <Terrence> Not sure if anyone was able to see my issue from earlier, but I've been having trouble setting up a filter using the ffmpeg api. I've been trying to use the aselect filter to only keep certain segments from an audio file. I think I'm having troubling passing in the right arguments but I'm not sure if there's anyway to tell if its in the right
[21:40:49] <Terrence> format or not.
[21:40:59] <Terrence> for example
[21:41:16] <Terrence> Suppose I wanted to use the ffmpeg executable, this is what I would pass
[21:41:18] <Terrence> ffmpeg -i input.wav -af "aselect='between(t,50,112)', asetpts=N/SR/TB" output.wav
[21:41:35] <Terrence> But as I'm trying to set up the filter graph, I've been using this as the argument
[21:41:50] <Terrence> const char* args = "aselect='between(t,50,112)', asetpts=N/SR/TB";
[21:41:58] <Terrence> Does anyone know if there's anything I need to fix?

[22:22:37] <DeHackEd> it should be fine. but you must also construct the input and output buffer/sink that goes with the filter pipeline
[22:23:11] <DeHackEd> in some ways the filter pipeline doesn't actually have an input and output. there are "filters" which expose a put/get function to move stuff in and out
[22:24:16] <Terrence> Okay
[22:24:43] <DeHackEd> did you check out the filter example program?
[22:25:09] <Terrence> And this is something I've also been struggling with DeHackEd, so with aselect being a filter that produces a new audio file, I have it encoding every frame that's passed through to the filter and it just produces the same file
[22:25:24] <Terrence> yes DeHackEd

[22:28:50] <Terrence> DeHackEd
[22:29:03] <Terrence> This is the function that creates the filter using the source and sink
[22:30:05] <Terrence> But my thing is, with aselect, what does it essentially do? Like I know some filters will edit a frame's metadata but I'm not exactly sure what the filtergraph is supposed to be doing
[22:30:45] <Terrence> I just want to produce a new audio file from an input with certain frames
[22:32:03] <DeHackEd> Terrence: first thing I noticed is you misspelled aselect on line 12
[22:36:02] <DeHackEd> I'm using avfilter_graph_parse_ptr. it takes a more -vf/-af style syntax

[22:41:22] <Terrence> But as I'm filtering every frame, do you happen to know what the filtergraph is supposed to be doing? Because the way I have it now is that it filters every frame outputted from the sink
[22:41:47] <Terrence> And I'm assuming the filter will essentially remove the ones that are not in the interval I selected
[22:42:18] <anonymousww> Hey everyone! I have a problem piping webp to output. After some seemingly random resolution the image becomes corrupted. Chrome is displaying small opaque rectangle. Filesize seem to be correct
[22:42:39] <anonymousww> So for example "ffmpeg -i pipe:0 -filter:v scale=w=1170:h=718 -f webp pipe:1" is working just fine
[22:42:52] <anonymousww> But "ffmpeg -i pipe:0 -filter:v scale=w=1170:h=720 -f webp pipe:1" results in corruputed output
[22:43:26] <anonymousww> That resolution seem to be depended on the input file because different images that i tried require different resolution to break
[22:43:56] <anonymousww> If i use mjpeg format everything works fine. As well as saving webp to file.

[23:49:09] <DennisF> Good evening
[23:52:14] <DennisF> I'm trying to learn how encode P010. I've gotten ffmpeg to do what I want (v410 to p010) but it's a bit too slow and the threading somehow doesn't work for me so I decided to try to DIY and learn about how this all works. Going from the ffmpeg code I can clearly see how the components for P010 are laid out in pixdesc.c, but I have not yet found how
[23:52:15] <DennisF> ffmpeg figures out that the 4-byte format for U and V are actually 16-bit numbers (the 6 bift left shit is clear)
[23:52:20] <DennisF> any tips appreciated :)
