[01:13:28] <shka> selwyn: hudson drops harsh truths
[01:13:37] <selwyn> i agree
[01:14:51] <shka> tough most of neon is not from russia
[01:14:54] <shka> it is from the ukraine
[01:15:05] <shka> which, i repeat, is not russia
[01:16:15] <shka> but hudson also pisses me 
[01:16:41] <shka> being eastern European is annoying
[01:17:43] <shka> because westerners either would want to put you under Russian heel or accuse you being white and therefore imperialistic racist
[01:18:09] <shka> it is not like we lack our own agency, you know :/
[01:20:32] <shka> and how the fuck is USA guilty of this war, huh?
[01:37:37] <shka> selwyn: the other side of equation is that Putin was talking about the great russia for 20 years and nobody in the west paid attention
[01:38:03] <shka> 2008 invasion of Georgia
[01:38:16] <shka> 2009 Obama's Russian reset
[01:38:57] <shka> 2014 invasion of Crimea and slap in a wrist as a response
[01:39:35] <shka> and sure, maybe no Industrialized country can conquer other industrialized country but Russia apparently didn't get that memo
[01:40:04] <selwyn> i thought that was a weaker point
[01:40:41] <shka> i swear to god, some people would rather see 200+ millions eastern Europeans be reduced to Russian human resources just not to feel bad about imperialism
[01:46:32] <waleee> Mariupol apparently had a large retro-computer muesum, https://twitter.com/Lord_Arse/status/1506695194825175048

[01:48:01] <selwyn> hudson tends to view history and current events in a very big picture way
[01:48:27] <selwyn> for example, he tends not to talk about the middle east that much, probably because it is of relatively marginal economic importance
[01:49:47] <selwyn> his reading of recent history and current events as 'the usa vs. everyone else' is made convincingly i think, including in this article
[01:50:04] <selwyn> it is not about throwing eastern europe under the bus, though i can see how it comes off that way
[01:50:10] <shka> GreaseMonkey: USA, what can is ay

[01:51:21] <shka> those are very weird people 
[01:51:38] <waleee> selwyn: also very relatable to current events (Putin trying to rewind time)
[01:51:44] <selwyn> pl: this is maybe a long shot but do you know where laser crystals come from
[01:52:34] <GreaseMonkey> when you view yourself as white and rich and have connections, clearly the source of all the problems is that you're white, because the implications of your position of privilege having anything to do with your wealth puts your wealth at risk and that's just not OK
[01:52:42] <pl> selwyn: wdym by laser crystals? Ruby lasers, well you can get ruby rods by paying few students at well-stocked university
[01:53:11] <GreaseMonkey> and of course, racism isn't hip anymore, so a lot of racists have to go down the self-loathing route
[01:53:38] <GreaseMonkey> and that should explain that part of the US
[01:54:11] <Lycurgus> then there's be racism against racists
[01:54:17] <Lycurgus> *there'll
[01:54:18] <selwyn> i was told (by a lithuanian) that some of their crystals are made in a collab with moscow state (possibly ti sapphire?)
[01:54:32] <selwyn> it made me wonder how screwed lasers will be by sanctions
[01:55:04] <pl> as for neon - Ukraine provided somehere between 50% to 70% worldide supply, which is going to screw up lasers used for UV photolithography
[01:55:16] <waleee> ti might be inreased in price, but otherwise it sounds more like a knowhow issue that can be rectified
[01:55:44] <pl> selwyn: generally, crystals like diamonds, sapphires, etc. are easy
[01:55:47] <shka> pl: photolithography will be fine
[01:56:07] <shka> they don't use that much neon in the grand scale of things
[01:56:11] <pl> selwyn: it's more a matter of having supply chain, and crystal lasers don't wear out their lasing mediums
[01:56:23] <Lycurgus> of lasers or ruby elements? sounds wrong for whole laser 
[01:57:07] <pl> shka: EUV photolithography uses up enough that it's unclear if they won't run out of emergency stocks before more neon is available
[01:57:56] <pl> TSMC is cagey about answering, but it's been implied they are going to dig out their reserves
[01:59:00] <selwyn> according to reuters ukrainian neon is a byproduct of russian steel manufacturing
[01:59:02] <selwyn> what
[01:59:19] <shka> pl: well, they can afford it, other neon applications may get squeezed out 
[01:59:37] <waleee> selwyn: the breakaway republics possibly? 
[02:00:43] <waleee> hm or not, Poroshenko was being investigated for buying coal from Donetsk
[02:01:28] <pl> selwyn: Probably not *Russian*, but related to USSR buildup of industry
[02:03:18] <selwyn> waleee: well, you need to manufacture the ti sapphire to the highest standard
[02:03:23] <selwyn> not going to be easy for newcomers
[02:03:47] <pl> waleee: Poroshenko is interesting in all of this. I believe the accusations that he was facing could lead to death sentence? or at least a life sentence, yet he returned to Ukraine apparently during the war? (Kinda lost track of all the crazy shit after Russia started the war in 2014)
[02:03:48] <waleee> "produced from cryogenic air-separation plants". Ukraine imported the emmissions from Russian steel manufacturers?
[02:04:01] <pl> still wouldn't get you neon
[02:04:51] <pl> but yes, air separation plants are considerably important systems in worldwide supply chains, despite how they could be theoretically placed anywhere
[02:05:10] <selwyn> sounds like rare earths
[02:06:58] <pl> rare earths have more localisation constraint due to impact of mining them
[02:07:18] <waleee> I still cant merge the wiki page's info about the air-separation plants & steel manufacturing
[02:08:49] <waleee> the steel plants themselves might do some air-separation for their oxygen needs, but why would they not do the whole process for eg. neon too at site then
[02:10:20] <pl> waleee: metalurgy needing pure oxygen and occassionally noble gases is major factor in setting up air filtration plants, yes, and for example South Korean only plant capable of providing Neon is extension of work done by steel making company
[02:10:35] <waleee> But I guess the Russian plants might have imported the oxygen from Ukraine
[02:11:00] <pl> waleee: Mariupol (where one of the major neon producers was) had large steelorks

[06:41:39] <hayley> moon-child: Earlier you stated that peephole optimisations for a simple compiler were fair game. Just to check, would you say that they are usually worth the additional code?
[06:42:08] <moon-child> worth it?  To whom, in what context?
[06:42:56] <hayley> Right. To whoever is writing the compiler, if they have concerns about keeping the compiler small.
[06:44:22] <moon-child> I just mean, 'small compiler' is not really enough information.  I can imagine contexts in which it would be, and in which it wouldn't.  Probably more of the former, but
[06:44:49] <hayley> It probably depends on how small, and how much one cares about performance. But this hypothetical compiler writer is supposed to care about performance as well.
[06:44:54] * hayley nods
[06:46:34] <hayley> McKeeman claims "The optimizing code emitting routine consists of about 400 of the 2000 instructions required for the compiler". 2000 instructions for an Algol compiler? Sheesh.
[06:47:18] <moon-child>  o.o
[06:48:12] <hayley> Well. Would you want to maintain a peephole optimiser if you were writing a simple compiler?
[06:49:44] <moon-child> probably.  But still: why am I making the compiler?  What am I compiling?  Why should it be small?
[06:50:22] *** Joins: notzmv (~zmv@user/notzmv)
[06:51:53] <hayley> The compiler is for a virtual machine designed to be portable. The machine uses a data stack and a whole pile of fixed size integers. I can only say that it should be small(ish) because you or I cannot maintain a larger optimising compiler by ourselves.
[06:54:34] <moon-child> couldn't we?  I think something fancier than peepholes is rather plausible
[06:54:46] <moon-child> didn't you write a register allocator and global value numberer recently?
[06:56:00] <hayley> Hm, I think "you or I" is an unrepresentative sample now, come to think of it. But I guess.
[06:57:11] <moon-child> :D
[06:58:12] <hayley> And I got paid to write (some part of) the SICL register allocator, too.

[08:09:11] <hayley> moon-child: would you be up for proof-reading a draft of this article? I have to check with my favourite coauthor if they'd be alright with it, so not right now though.
[08:12:36] <kakuhen> does anyone know how to make vs code format code as you type
[08:12:58] <kakuhen> everything i find online says "just push C-k C-f every time, bro"
[08:13:20] <kakuhen> no way the most popular editor out there is unable to do what i took for granted in literally every editor ever (except notepad.exe i guess)
[08:15:23] <hayley> idk. People argue for tabs over spaces because tabbing requires less keystrokes. Having Emacs manage your indentation takes 0 keystrokes still.
[08:18:17] <White_Flame> I argue for "fewer" over "less" :-P
[08:19:21] <dave0> tabs are easier to de-dent with backspace
[08:19:38] <kakuhen> one of my more controversial opinions about common lisp is that
[08:19:40] <hayley> White_Flame: ok beach
[08:19:46] <White_Flame> heh
[08:20:07] <kakuhen> while i personally love emacs, it's absurd to think anyone will like it, and terrible support on windows makes it nearly impossible to get many people started with learning common lisp
[08:20:14] <kakuhen> s/anyone/everyone

[08:21:49] <hayley> I wonder who that's controversial for.
[08:21:54] <moon-child> White_Flame: how about 'less key stroking'?

[08:23:19] <kakuhen> the person who is working on the vs code formatter for lisp, i commend, because it seems to be a single effort, and it's actually decent
[08:23:39] <kakuhen> it's just that vs code seems unable to automatically format as you type
[08:24:05] <kakuhen> so editing lisp becomes clunky since you have improper formatting everywhere until you invoke "re-indent lines" or hook saving file to your formatter
[08:24:10] <moon-child> White_Flame: as they say, the penis mightier than the keyboard

[08:42:14] <kakuhen> btw is the (values) idiom used in the MOP text still in-use today
[08:43:02] <kakuhen> I'm considering using it in some before/after methods to signal to the reader/programmer that such methods are used for side effects only, not for anything else
[08:43:27] <hayley> I don't see why not.
[08:43:49] <hayley> Well, maybe (values) isn't common, but returning something like NIL might be. idk
[08:44:30] <gilberth> Well, people have different opinions on that. I personally like the use of (VALUES) to say "No, sorry, there really isn't a value for you." But some don't like it.
[08:44:33] <moon-child> I've seen both, idk how common they are, was actually thinking of asking the same question recently: (values) vs nil
[08:45:10] <kakuhen> i assume people will not go out of their way to run before/after methods in isolation, but assuming they do, i suppose the repl returning "No values" is much more meaningful than "NIL"

[08:58:48] <moon-child> in other news: I think I figured out how to fuse nested applications of rank

[08:59:08] <hayley> Anyone do that?
[08:59:39] <moon-child> rank fusion?  idk, maybe co-dfns or apltail
[09:00:11] <moon-child> apltail doesn't have rank

[09:09:57] <kakuhen> in order to stream audio to my speakers i am finally designing a tiny daemon that can receieve pcm data as a stream of bytes and play back. then from lisp somehow send a mach message with an array of bytes
[09:10:08] <kakuhen> mach seems the simplest way to go but i also dont think its very accessible from a lisp
[09:15:50] * hayley observes a three-star C++ programmer in the wild
[09:15:56] <moon-child> hmm it occurs to me there's more to it though
[09:16:13] <moon-child> I can generate dumb nested loops probably without much trouble, but maybe want a blocked traversal format, like matrix multipliers?
[09:17:26] <moon-child> kakuhen: why not something like sdl ffi?

[10:33:45] <hayley> They replace the value with None, but keep the key and node intact. Which works, but having dealt with "tombstones" in linear probing hash tables, is undesirable.
[10:35:21] <qhong> call-next-method doesn't let you change the arguments -- should this restriction be removed?

[11:57:49] <hayley> But I came up with the closed form mn - m(m-1)/2 would I remove m times from a list with n elements. So, I'd expect iterations to go faster as I remove more. But as m is small, mn dominates. So I see linear runtime.

[15:02:52] <kakuhen> in the before method of foo for X, if I decide to dynamically mixin Y, does that let me alter the dispatch of CLOS

[15:05:53] <shka> kakuhen: you are wondering about the method precedence?
[15:06:08] <kakuhen> can i do something funny with around methods maybe
[15:06:25] <kakuhen> in short, bad design is leading me to do bad things with CLOS
[15:06:31] <shka> well, you can ALWAYS do something funny with around 
[15:06:37] <kakuhen> ok cool
[15:07:18] <kakuhen> ok i think i got what i wnat
[15:07:47] <shka> using multimethods is sometimes alternative to mixins 
[15:08:44] <kakuhen> https://plaster.tymoon.eu/view/3001#3001
[15:08:55] <kakuhen> ok this is what i am attempting to do but im not sure if its possible
[15:09:03] <shka> it is also somewhat useful, because, well, you don't need to have every class combination galore 
[15:09:33] <shka> kakuhen: possible, but a rather stupid idea 
[15:09:43] <kakuhen> sounds like a kakuhen idea
[15:10:23] <kakuhen> i'll note the mixin wont happen all the time
[15:10:35] <shka> rule of thumb is that mxins should not SUBSTITUTE logic 
[15:10:36] <kakuhen> i guess i should've emphasized that in the before method
[15:10:45] <shka> they should supplement 
[15:11:30] <shka> technically this is feasible but it simply is not sound architecture 
[15:12:59] <kakuhen> i guess i will attempt learning multi-method, or do something a bit more clever
[15:13:27] <shka> i think that this kind of design seems to indicate that your protocol needs reconsidering
[15:14:12] <shka> for instance, perhaps you need additional predicate defgeneric somewhere?
[15:14:36] <shka> and then have defun foo and defgeneric foo* combination
[15:14:50] <shka> when foo would call the predicate and either go into foo* or not
[15:16:50] <kakuhen> ah i see my problem
[15:17:08] <kakuhen> so the protocol i am using plays nicely when objects "embed" into each other, but not when they inherit
[15:17:35] <kakuhen> i.e. rather than having common-class be a superclass of subclass-1
[15:17:42] <kakuhen> subclass-1 contains a slot with common-class instance

[15:18:28] <kakuhen> to play nicely with inheritance i'd have to do the foo* stuff you are suggesting
[15:20:12] <shka> yeah, something like that 
[15:20:33] <shka> in general, this requires careful design of the initial protocl
[15:21:27] <kakuhen> yeah, i often find myself making a seemingly decent design
[15:21:57] <kakuhen> and once i am using it more increasingly more stuff (in my case, processing entire codecs), i begin to realize every single flaw i somehow got away with
[15:22:12] <kakuhen> though in retrospect i can see where my deisgn was showing telltale signs of problems
[15:22:31] <kakuhen> will fix later ™️
[15:25:22] <shka> i personally think that abundance of mixins, especially non-trivial ones, in a design is a problem indicator
[15:28:30] <kakuhen> thankfully this would've been the first mixin
[15:28:50] <kakuhen> i don't know how to say ぎりぎりセーフ in english unfortunately

[15:29:20] <kakuhen> in any case, thank you for telling me the dispatch hijack idea was stupid
