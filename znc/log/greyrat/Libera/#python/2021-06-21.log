[00:03:54] *** Joins: tecdroid (~tecdroid@2a04:d480:0:1::3)
[00:03:57] <dagb> douglaswinship: you need to install tcl/tk, and then you may consider 'pip install --user tkinter'
[00:03:58] <tecdroid> hi
[00:04:59] <douglaswinship> raek: it was already installed as part of debian when I got the laptop.

[00:05:53] <tecdroid> can someone tell me what python does different to just fp.read in c? i got some gpio driver for an industrial pc and can write to it using python but reading is always b''. c example i've been given works..
[00:06:15] <raek> douglaswinship: then the python3 package is split up into multiple parts. instal python3-tk to get the tkinter parts
[00:06:25] <douglaswinship> (I actually tried uninstalling it once, and broke my entire GUI, the laptop would only run as a basic terminal until I got someone to help me fix it. So it seems to be fundametnally built in to my operating system.)
[00:06:59] <douglaswinship> raek: that's the trouble. According to apt, "python-tk" is already installed.
[00:07:13] <raek> (or python-tk if you happen to use python 2 instead of python 3)
[00:07:22] <douglaswinship> Although maybe it needs updating.
[00:07:22] <dagb> douglaswinship: which debian version is this?
[00:08:29] <douglaswinship> dagb: Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)
[00:08:55] <douglaswinship> raek: python3-tk and python-tk are both installed. That's what's confusing me.

[00:12:38] <Akuli> douglaswinship, so what happens if you run:    python3 -c "import tkinter"
[00:12:53] <douglaswinship> dukwon: apt search doesn't seem to think any package exists with that name.
[00:13:24] <Akuli> dukwon, dagb: the debian package is named "python3-tk" and tkinter is not something you can install with pip

[00:14:40] <dagb> Akuli: you are right, of course
[00:14:48] <Akuli> douglaswinship, so what happens if [00:17:25] <raek> douglaswinship: ok, so the python 3.9 version you have first in your PATH is not the one that apt installs packages for...
[00:17:43] <Akuli> douglaswinship, next time you install your own python, please use "make altinstall" instead of "make install" (and also consider ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local so that you don't need sudo)
[00:18:09] <Akuli> but to get this to work:    /usr/bin/python3 -m thonny
[00:18:10] <douglaswinship> Oh, huh. I forgot about that. Yes, i think i did install python3.9, because the system one coudln't be upgraded to 3.9. I forget how, sorry.

[00:19:58] <Akuli> tecdroid, not necessarily true

[00:20:24] <Akuli> raek, this is obviously really opinioned but i use "make altinstall" along with --prefix=$HOME/.local
[00:20:32] <Akuli> it's kind of boring and plain but it really works well
[00:20:40] <douglaswinship> okay, I will try to remember where and how i installed python3.9, remove it and then reinstall it with tk support. And I'll check the comments here and make sure i follow the advice. But all of that is for the future. Right now, I've got thonny opening, and that's the most important thing. :) Thanks for all the help!
[00:20:50] <Akuli> raek, python3 points to system python, python3.10 points to what i installed a few weeks ago
[00:20:57] <Akuli> from ~/.local/bin/
[00:20:58] <raek> ok, so altinstall install only python3.x and not python or python3? and you build it yourself?
[00:21:03] <Akuli> yes
[00:21:13] <Akuli> and with --prefix, you can do it all inside ~/.local
[00:21:16] <Akuli> so you don't need sudo
[00:21:24] <raek> right.
[00:21:32] <Akuli> douglaswinship, please don't try to remove it!
[00:21:39] <Akuli> you might accidentally remove the python that the system came with
[00:21:41] <Akuli> and that's bad :D
[00:22:01] <Akuli> or ... if you know what you're doing then nevermind :D if you make sure you only delete stuff under /usr/local/ then i guess it's ok

[00:23:00] <Akuli> greatgatsby, yeah, that's another popular option
[00:23:07] <Akuli> as i said, my way to do it is boring and not at all sexy or popular
[00:23:16] <raek> I'm a big fan of "dpkg -L <package>" (which files does this package own?) and "dpkg -S <file>" (which package owns this file?) and bening able to remove packages I don't use anymore
[00:23:28] <Akuli> didn't know about -L, but thanks :D
[00:23:36] <Akuli> i use -S occationally
[00:23:59] <raek> I guess with the .local approach I could simply remove all direactories with python3.x in its name..
[00:24:11] <Akuli> but yeah i dislike how python build will succeed even if ssl libs aren't installed, and then anything that uses https or hashlib won't work

[00:27:06] <dibas> heya guys! this might not exactly be on topic, if that's the case i'd be happy about any other channel suggestions. i have to deal with an sqlite database that's been for use with some proprietary software (no access to binaries to reverse engineer right now). for some reason most of the important text fields are saved as binary blobs with no
[00:27:06] <dibas> common encoding used. it seems to have a high entropy so i'm guessing it's either compressed or encrypted (which wouldn't make a lot of sense), i do have access to the cleartext though, i just need to find out how it has been encoded/compressed. judging by the cleartext it should be using around 2 bytes per char. sorry for the wall of text. is

[00:30:21] <Akuli> sometimes "web vs mobile" feels like "which inner platform effect do you want"
[00:30:36] <dibas> Akuli, there are no magic bytes included unfortunately, so file tells me it's just data. i tried zlib headers with various compression options to no avail, i wasn't sure if it makes sense to include random gzip/bzip2/lzma headers, too, but it's worth trying i guess. will report back in a sec
[00:31:00] <Akuli> ah, so you have tried everything i could think of, nevermind then :D
[00:32:15] <dibas> i really don't think it's gzip with all the header stuff that's quite important (flags, crc and whatnot)

[04:45:34] <samian> that would make it easy to know which function is called before which
