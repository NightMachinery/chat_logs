[02:09:19] <Payam> jinsun, what about the question about bits. How does it calculate if the result is true or false?
[02:10:25] <jinsun> True is 1, False is 0, so your result will also be either 0 or 1
[02:10:31] <The-Compiler> if you need to check for None only, you could do   sum(1 for e in [a, b] if e is not None) == 1   but it's certainly a bit more complex

[02:12:21] <The-Compiler> Payam: similarly to 'and' and 'or' (which only care about True/False), there are bitwise operators, & and |. For xor, there's only the bitwise one, because that's not typically used for booleans.
[02:12:53] <The-Compiler> Payam: like the name says, those operators take two binary numbers, and the operation always combines two bits in it, to get a bit in the result

[02:14:36] <jinsun> Payam: if you convert the inputs to bool, then the xor operator will only get 0 or 1 as the input, so you cannot get that big number as output, output will be either 0 or 1
[02:14:52] <Payam> yes u are right
[02:15:18] <The-Compiler> Payam: so for example, 0b1001 | 0b1100 == 0b1101 (every bit in the result combines the same bit from the LHS and RHS, so it's essentially: 1 | 1 = 1, 0 | 1 = 1, 0 | 0 = 1, 1 | 0 = 1)

The token is not for the app itself but for the app to contact an external API and return data to the user (Prometheus exporter being scraped by Prometheus). Multiple servers will be scraping
[02:23:02] <segfaultz> the app and consequently triggering requests to the other API, so a thread/session safe means of storage/retrieval is ideal. I am not sure that I should be re-authenticating with every request and getting a new token.

[02:23:44] <The-Compiler> xlirate: can't say I'd recommend it, though
[02:24:08] <jinsun> The-Compiler: the bitwise xor can be overloaded unlike `and` and `or`, so bool does the int -> bool convertion in its `__or__` method I guess
[02:24:11] <xlirate> segfaultz, what scope do you want that storage to be? You said "between requests" so globally? or tied to something else?
[02:25:23] <segfaultz> Global. Essentially whenever one of the multiple Prometheus servers hits the /metrics endpoint, I'd like the access_token to be reused; or, if it's discovered to be expired, for a new one to be generated and stored to be used by future sessions (scrapes). Rinse and repeat.
[02:25:37] <xlirate> The-Compiler, Thank you for this. I do not like it, but it is better than having Java call into Jython using similar reflection. I didn't design the API, it is older than me
[02:25:38] <The-Compiler> xlirate: consider passing in the function instead, i.e. pr.start(func) or whatever
[02:25:48] <segfaultz> If this is too complicated and it's safe for me to just get new tokens every time, that's fine
[02:26:16] <The-Compiler> xlirate: also FWIW no idea if this will work with Jython (or anything other than CPython really)
[02:26:19] <xlirate> If it were one or two, I would do that, but I need some combination of 14 or so, because defining functions with well known names is how you register events
[02:26:40] <xlirate> I am trying to move it from Jython2 to Cython3
[02:26:43] <The-Compiler> xlirate: What about pr.start(globals()) at least then?
[02:27:51] <xlirate> That would also work, but if I can hide my magic from the students it is worth the extra bull. I plan to hunt for all the functions that I need once and store them so this magic is contained

I saw some articles that indicates that mocks are code-smell (or similar, don't use mocks), but in the other hand from my understanding unit-test should be isolated and test only the relevant unit, without any additional classes, which is conflicts with the first section I wrote about

[11:23:56] <theprophet> @rep
[11:24:00] *** Joins: hams (~hams@user/hams)
[11:24:30] <theprophet> Repiphany in other words you can change the method in child class method without touching the parent methods right?
[11:24:58] <theprophet> and that method will have the same meaning but might have other course is that correct?
[11:25:07] <Repiphany> That question seems irrelevant to the word "implementation"
[11:25:33] <theprophet> does implementation mean providing?
[11:25:39] <theprophet> what is the meaning of the word?
[11:26:08] <Repiphany> An implementation is a specific instance of code
[11:26:17] <theprophet> as i said, in my native language word imlementation has many meanings with different esscence
[11:26:29] <hams> whats ur natv lang?
[11:26:33] <theprophet> yes but what does method implementing mean?
[11:26:37] <theprophet> hams georgian.
[11:26:52] <Repiphany> "method implementing" doesn't mean anything specific to me
[11:27:10] <Repiphany> I take it just to mean implementing (i.e. writing) a method
[11:27:39] <theprophet> ok, what if i ovverride method in parent class and add something new to the overriden method is that implementation also?
[11:28:01] <Repiphany> Sure, you're implementing a new method
[11:28:42] <theprophet> so implementing means that i am writing something that has its own deffinition?
[11:28:45] <Repiphany> The main ways people use "implement" in programming are for example, implementing an algorithm in X language (e.g. a sorting algorithm or whatever)
[11:29:19] <Repiphany> The logic of the sorting algorithm is language-agnostic, but the programmer has to translate that into a programming language and ensure that it actually does what it's supposed to do
[11:30:16] <theprophet> ok i kind of got it , so if i have an idea and i want to put in the code does this mean i am implementing ?
[11:30:31] <Repiphany> and sometimes, there are "implementation details", things that depend on how exactly the code was written that could influence things outside of what the algorithm specified
[11:31:07] <Repiphany> Sure
[11:32:27] <Repiphany> Say you're implementing a function to compute the factors of some number. An implementation detail might be the order that you end up returning factors smallest to largest, or in factor pairs or whatever else
[11:33:18] <Repiphany> Other code that you write may or may not depend on the factors being in any specific order
[11:34:07] <theprophet> please give me a sec i need to analyze this :D
[11:34:54] <theprophet> can you explain this in farm animals? :D

[16:26:30] <rendar> yes..
[16:26:41] <bjs> does patch_stdout only patch sys.stdout? or stderr as well? What if instead of printing you write to another file?

[16:27:12] <bjs> (e.g. `while True: await asyncio.sleep(0.1); print(time.time())`  <- let this run in the background and see if there's any "gaps" where the loop was blocked.

I don't whats wrong exactly but here is the snippet of code doing that -> https://pastebin.com/fTd9jyNA

[18:59:26] <ChrisWarrick> janemba: is there any reason why you’re doing it all manually?
[19:00:09] <janemba> ChrisWarrick: well yes this is just examples for a real program I will do it using pycurl or httpx
[19:00:12] *** Joins: jerobado (~jerobado@185.225.234.193)
[19:00:18] <ChrisWarrick> janemba: I’d recommend using httpx then
[19:00:44] <ChrisWarrick> janemba: it’s much easier to debug problems if you have a known-good http library
[19:01:09] <janemba> ChrisWarrick: but well I really want to know for what reason its not working with socket
[19:01:27] <bonestormii_> janemba, is there any other program that already exists which is capable of sending these http requests, such as a web page or api front end like swagger or something?
[19:01:41] <bonestormii_> I'd guess that the GET request is malformed in some minor way.
[19:02:13] <bonestormii_> If there is some kind of web front end you know of that can generate this request, I would try analyzing that and comparing it to your request.
[19:02:30] *** Quits: edocod (~edocod@user/edocod) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[19:03:07] <bonestormii_> Like, does the GET request get a response using your code without a proxy, going directly to the API endpoint?
[19:03:11] <janemba> bonestormii_: I did that using pycurl. So with pycurl it works fine so copy/paste the same request (I used pycurl in verbose mode) I can paste the whole pycurl log
[19:03:11] <eson123> also another question please, by creating a virtualenv and having some libraries installed in it but not in the global environment, can someone else simply just use my virtualenv without manually installing every lib that i installed it in on another machine ?

[19:04:14] <bonestormii_> janemba: Yeah that's what I would do. If it fails even without the proxy, then the issue isn't with the proxy, but with the HTTP GET request.
[19:04:20] <eson123> is there anything similar to it that i can try and make it across-machine ?

[19:05:16] <bonestormii_> janemba: It may be slightly annoying to set up, but an HTTP debugger proxy like this may help in analyzing the raw HTTP request: https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler
[19:05:27] <eson123> i am sending my project to my friend but my project requires lot of libs, some are from .whl files and some are from pip with specific version, asking him to do all over again can take time and we usually switch across machine very often

[19:06:00] <shlomif> hi all! How do i get "pip3 install --user --upgrade pydistman" to install "attrs" using requirements.txt?
[19:06:05] <bonestormii_> Basically, capture your traffic with fiddler using pycurl, look at the request that is issued. Then try your code, capture it, and compare it to the request that was issued by pycurl. Make them match identically and I bet you get a response.
[19:06:11] <ChrisWarrick> eson123: it’s best to have all your dependencies on pypi, making installs much easier
[19:06:26] <ChrisWarrick> eson123: you might want something like pyinstaller
[19:06:57] <ChrisWarrick> shlomif: you don’t do that with requirements.txt, you put it in install_requires in setup.py or in the appropriate place for your packaging thing of choice
[19:07:05] <janemba> bonestormii_: so it works fine without the proxy, I got the answer. I'm pasting the pycurl log
[19:07:06] <eson123> yea pyinstaller is cool, but it sure take memory and its startup time is kinda slow
[19:07:11] <eson123> but if that is the last option then ok
[19:07:28] <shlomif> ChrisWarrick: ah
[19:07:28] <eson123> also on my machine and some other windows 10 machine, i can't use pypy dependecies on library like pyaudio, i had to manually go through .whl
[19:07:30] <bonestormii_> If you are wanting some nice abstraction for issuing http requests over a socket though, you are basically going to be coding your own http request library, which is fine if that is your objective for learning.  However, you can probably figure out how to pass your socket object to an existing HTTP library and let it handle the formulation of the request for you.
[19:07:59] <ChrisWarrick> shlomif: (I don’t see any setup.py/setup.cfg/pyproject.toml in the github repo?)
[19:08:01] <bonestormii_> janemba: interesting it worked, so I guess the request is fine

[20:33:37] <compufreak> janemba: so seems like if you have an https proxy and an https site you need to get an ssl socket inside an ssl socket, apparently which isn't very straight forward...

[20:58:20] <jabberwock> I mean.. the reality is that needs to be extremely random or intentional
[20:58:22] <Donitz> yes you can fake collisions
[20:58:42] <Donitz> but I'm not using this for file verification
[20:58:46] <Donitz> for downloads
[20:58:57] <jabberwock> I wouldn't use it for security or privacy, but maybe for storing false positives from some code analysis tool
[20:59:09] <nedbat> Donitz: as I said, the scanner was dumb and shallow. It also caused me some headaches.
[20:59:13] <Donitz> to be really fair, the while idea of using checksums to make sure a file is safe was a bit silly from the start
[20:59:23] <Donitz> anything that has access to a web server and can change the file, can also change the checksum
[20:59:41] <Donitz> to verify that a file is not corrupt however
[20:59:41] <jabberwock> yep. and that has happened
[21:00:04] <jabberwock> we talked about this yesterday and got into using CBC blockchains for tracing a file change's origin
[21:00:38] <rendar> i have a python prompt that will run commands creating new tasks with create_task() and without awaiting them. now it seems that if i want to ask another prompt, e.g. say a password prompt, i MUST await the task, otherwise the password prompt will not rendered correctly... any ideas?
[21:01:02] <jabberwock> Donitz, but the more GPUs advance, the easier it gets. I think to be future proof it's best not to use it for anything that "matters"
[21:01:30] <jabberwock> rendar, keep the password prompt in its own thread that uses a shared variable?
[21:01:42] <Donitz> oh well, it hardly hurts at this scale
[21:01:51] <Donitz> but at large scale, you really need to consider whether you need to use a slow algo
[21:01:58] <Donitz> I mean, purposefully slow

[22:01:33] <sysRPL> i figure if i build a 3d printed box to house the sensor and take samples laying swatches on top, i can find a curve to match the sensor value with the actual color to create a curve which could be used to adjust the sensor results to more match other non swatch examples i sample

[23:23:39] <desophos> i'm using subprocess.run([sys.executable, "-m", "mymodule", ...], env=os.environ.copy()) to run a cli programmatically inside a virtualenv. however, when i use pyinstaller to bundle my app into an exe, this command fails because sys.executable is no longer python. is there a way to make this work with pyinstaller? thanks!
