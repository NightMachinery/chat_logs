[00:01:25] <zenof> tomreyn: yes, occurs with any other user as well, after lgging in using gdm it takes way too long, and then, firing up apps result in the same delay.
[00:02:37] <zenof> well, but installing the font and the related dmesg output about fontconfig is the only thing I have.. :/
[00:03:05] <tomreyn> note that we haven't yet seen any logs, error messages in context,
[00:03:41] <oerheks> way to long - how long should that be?
[00:03:49] <zenof> right, atm I can't copy& paste as I'm writing from another  machine
[00:03:59] <oerheks> and what services/mounts are running?
[00:04:27] <tomreyn> that's what ssh is for ;)
[00:04:33] <zenof> well, it used to be within seconds (maybe 7 or 10) over the last year(s) . now it's more like a minute.

[01:02:44] <wizard1> is there anyone
[01:02:46] <de-facto> no zoom, just some youtube videos, the audio wildly stutters and now always moves balance to right side
[01:02:54] <de-facto> its annoying beyond words
[01:03:01] <tomreyn> !ask | hi wizard1
[01:03:01] <ubottu> hi wizard1: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[01:03:12] <sarnold> de-facto: oh :( ew
[01:04:41] <de-facto> sometimes killing pulseaudio MANY times in a row (in  a while loop) seems to help (starting pulseaudio manually), but the only thing that really helps is a full reboot
[01:05:18] <de-facto> problem is that this state is reached everytime after some bug becomes active, e.g. its only a matter of time since a boot till audio becomes broken
[01:05:27] <wizard1> i have quetion
[01:05:38] <tomreyn> de-facto: is this a standard ubuntu installation, which version, which kernel, which desktop environment? do oyu have third party software installed?

[04:28:22] <sarnold> hmm I would have guessed it to have been unecessary even then
[04:28:25] <sarnold> heh
[04:28:36] <marc_> I installed ubuntu today
[04:29:09] <sarnold> so, you can generate something for your system with xorg -configure  -- that'll do the autodiscovery of eveyrthing and write out a config that matches what it found. *but* that's vast overkill, you can supply just the fragments you want to override
[04:29:10] <akk> I think xorg.conf started being phased out sometime around 2006-2008

[06:38:17] <webchat99> Ok, thank you very much
[06:38:48] <webchat99> I don't think so, how can I check?
[06:38:58] <Belamos> apt install kubuntu-desktop
[06:39:09] <Belamos> that is going to install a LOT of stuff... but alongside, also "kdm"
[06:39:17] <Belamos> and then you switch from "gdm" to "kdm" and that should solve it
[06:39:28] <Belamos> your login screen will look different - but it should solve the problem
[06:39:39] <Belamos> bugfixing why gdm is broken would probably take longer - much longer
[06:39:59] <Belamos> and again, you can boot from kdm into gnome as you're used to
[06:40:52] <webchat99> Thanks, it's installing now, how can I change to kdm once it's finished? (And also change back in case things go wrong immediatly haha)
[06:40:57] <Belamos> and yes,  "sudo dpkg-reconfigure kdm"  or  "sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm"  respectively should do the trick
[06:41:11] <Belamos> there you can change what software should greet you after booting up
[06:41:26] <webchat99> Ok
[06:41:28] <Belamos> webchat99, how long will the installation take?
[06:41:32] <Belamos> I can stay here until then
[06:41:41] <Belamos> but only if you have a decent internet connection ;)
[06:41:58] <webchat99> 2m remaining
[06:42:20] <Belamos> god damn,  your internet connection is brilliant then
[06:42:42] <Belamos> you have downloaded the entire kubuntu-desktop in a matter of minutes?
[06:42:46] <webchat99> Really variable tho --'

[08:07:36] <msim_> and there's 165 broken packages
[08:07:49] <Bashing-om> !jammy
[08:07:50] <ubottu> Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish) will be the 36th release of Ubuntu, scheduled for release April 2022 (https://ubottu.com/y/jj). Join #ubuntu-next for support and questions.
[08:08:15] <msim_> oh i see so it's trying to upgrade to a prerelease
[08:08:30] <msim_> ehm in that case i'm not sure if i should ask here or there, how can i ugprade to the latest, stable, release?
[08:09:07] <Bashing-om> msim_: -next is best :D
[08:09:16] <msim_> sure, thanks :D
[08:13:33] <msim_> actually since i'm here, on another note - the whole reason i'm trying to upgrade is because i'm trying to create a .deb package for a piece of software. the thing is, we rely on qtbase5-dev >5.15, but focal (afaik, the latest LTS release) only has 5.12, whereas the newer versions have >5.15. after thinking about it for a bit, i think the better way to solve this is either link a static version of the qt libs, or ship the qt dynamic libs on the side.
[08:13:33] <msim_>  am i missing something here or are these my only options?
[08:14:10] <msim_> (again sorry, i'm not sure if this is the best place to ask)

[19:20:23] <Peanut> Howdy - I've just rebooted a Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS machine, and it seems to have lost its ability to use unqualified hostnames after the reboot. The network interface is configured in Network Manager, and has the right search-domain set (verified  in nm-connection-editor). If I do 'resolvectl query hostname' it works, but ping returns 'temporary failure in name resolution'.

[19:25:14] <Peanut> The problem I have is that short (unqualified) hostnames suddenly give an error. So these are DNS entries in our local authoritative DNS server.
[19:25:44] <leftyfb> alkisg: the fact that systemd-resolved --status returned means we are fine

[22:40:05] <BinarySavior> hi i changed my VPS hostname using sudo hostname but then after rebooting it changed back
[22:40:13] <BinarySavior> is there something i need to do to make it permanent
[22:41:02] <oerheks> yes
[22:41:04] <oerheks> !hostname
[22:41:05] <ubottu> Use hostname <somehostname> to set the hostname, or to do it permanently: edit /etc/hosts to include BOTH the old and new hostname and then change /etc/hostname to the new one. WARNING! Make sure that your current hostname and /etc/hosts match, otherwise sudo may not work properly.
[22:41:09] <oerheks> 2 places..

[22:43:03] *** Joins: RangerBobVA (~bmaddox@user/rangerbobva)
[22:43:06] <tomreyn> hmm i guess hostnamectl doesn't update /etc/hosts, though, so it's still two places
[22:43:42] <oerheks> indeed .. i was surprised it does not stick
[22:44:47] <oerheks> tomreyn, so this factoid is not really complete? hostname <somehostname>   <> hostnamectl set-hostname <newhostname>

[22:47:36] <tomreyn> oerheks: i believe that "hostname <somehostname>" sets it temporarily, until reboot, "hostnamectl set-hostname <newhostname>" sets it now until reboot, and also after reboot - but neither update /etc/hosts. so probably not complete.
[22:48:13] <oerheks> oke, both are valid, but do not stick

[23:17:58] <mybalzitch> so I have no idea
[23:18:05] <mybalzitch> works in chrome though
