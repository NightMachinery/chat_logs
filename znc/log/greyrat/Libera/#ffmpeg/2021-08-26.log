[08:26:08] <sgon> Hi do anyone know which `-vcodec` and `-acodec` I can use for the most common mp4? When I use the default ffmpeg config to convert a video, it always has some problems when I use some mobile apps (audio and video mis-match). I don't know what the cause is. I think it's better use the most common codec.

[09:12:15] <Wallboy> Hi, I'm having an issue with audio drifting out of sync. The original video is 29.97 fps. I'm extracting the frames into PNGs and then post-processing them in another program that interpolates the sequence of images to 60fps. Then I'm using ffmpeg to recombine the images with a framerate of 60fps and using the audio input from the original video. However overtime the audio drifts out of sync
[09:12:16] <Wallboy> by 2 seconds by the end of the video. What's the way to tackle this issue? I've tried various async and vsync parameters with no luck
[09:12:31] <sgon> msmith12[m]: thanks a lot. But I tried that, I still get video/audio mismatch when I send the video in the app. The app will auto compress the video somehow. I don't know why other people's videos are OK, but ffmpeg processed video will have mismatch problem.
[09:12:58] <msmith12[m]> what app is this
[09:13:37] <sgon> PS: the video compressed by the app will have mismatch problem when playing in the app. But it won't have any problems when playing in vlc. Something with the app, but I have to use it. So wondering if I can do anything.
[09:14:05] <sgon> msmith12[m]: the app is wechat. Not really an English app.
[09:14:19] <msmith12[m]> oh i know that app. Strange its not working
[09:15:04] <msmith12[m]>  I would try using http://alfg.dev/ffmpeg-commander and playing around with the settings

[09:17:48] <msmith12[m]> then use output to reencode
[09:19:27] <sgon> msmith12[m] yeah, that is what I did. I tried many things. But the video will always have the problem after sending via that app. I tried to save the converted file from the app. One thing I notice: the ffmpeg converted file (or the original file) has a constant framerate. But the app converted version has a variable framerate. I am not sure if
[09:19:28] <sgon> this is the cause.

[09:20:45] <msmith12[m]> Whatever the case might be, I'm sure JEEB will know the solution however. In the meantime while waiting for him you can try seeing if gst-launch works?

[09:21:37] <msmith12[m]> but good luck
[09:22:08] <sgon> msmith12[m] thanks a lot. Do this channel has a log service? In case, I got disconnected, I can check the log. My network is not stable, because I am using some kinda VPN to bypass my country's firewall.
[09:22:18] <msmith12[m]> Use element.io

[09:22:55] <sgon> sorry. it should s/Do/Does/ ... my bad.
[09:26:29] <sgon> msmith12[m]: I checked element.io. I am running Linux. My official repo doesn't have that app. I am afraid to install any app from PPA. I think I will keep using web.libera.chat for now. Hopefully, my network is OK today. Thank you very much.

[09:40:07] <sgon> FYI: I tried Handbrake app. The Preset Devices > Android 576p25 will make the video/audio matching when seding via wechat app. But the weird part is the video ratio is wrong and stretched after compressing by the wechat app. A new problem instead of the old one. Wechat app is really bad and picky on the video format.

[14:26:38] <TheDJVG> Hi all. I've got ffmpeg compiled with nvenc enabled (Driver Version: 470.63.01    CUDA Version: 11.4) but whatever I try ffmpeg just hangs when I try to encode using nvenc. I try with the most simple command: "./ffmpeg -i ./test.mp4  -c:v h264_nvenc out.mp4 -loglevel debug"
[14:26:55] <TheDJVG> But it just hangs after the message "h264_nvenc @ 0x4135980] Loaded sym: cuWaitExternalSemaphoresAsync" and chews up 100% CPU

[14:48:20] <TheDJVG> I'll build it without striping and see what happens then. I wonder if the fact that I create a static build might be the problem.

[15:10:09] <JEEB> you can compare against BtbN's build or so

[15:14:17] <TheDJVG> Yes, and I made sure driver/cuda versions match
[15:14:33] <TheDJVG> Let me check BtbN's builds
[15:16:31] <sfan5> attempting a static build when ffmpeg has to load libcuda dynamically sounds like a source of problems to me
[15:22:47] <TheDJVG> As far as I can see it still loads cuda "openat(AT_FDCWD, "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcuda.so.1", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 5

I managed to get a list of yuvj420p `VideoFrame`s, but I can't figure out how to encode them into jpeg.

[16:10:20] <bertieb> (assuming libavcodec questions are on topic here) Newbie question: is it permitted for a codec to return a different pixel format than one requested in the AVCodecContext ? I am using an app which sets 'BGRX' in the context for the h264 decoder, but the received AVFrame has a pixel format of GBRP9LE (which is causing issues). I read the "send/receive encoding and decoding API overview" in avodec.h
[16:10:22] <bertieb> but I couldn't find documentation on the expected behaviour from the codec

[16:42:10] <JEEB> in any case, I prefer to wait until I get an AVFrame
[16:42:15] <JEEB> since that AVFrame is then the point of truth
[16:42:33] <JEEB> (technically the pix_fmt can change during decoding due to changes in the stream etc)
[16:42:48] <JEEB> also wow, someone actually utilized 9bit H.264?
[16:42:56] <JEEB> I only remember the old el dorado sample
[16:43:00] <JEEB> which was 9bit
[16:43:40] <bertieb> JEEB: lol, I am not terribly familiar with pixel formats but I thought that was an odd one!
[16:43:43] <bertieb> thanks for the xplanation
[16:44:04] <bertieb> the wrinkle here is the application is talking to itself in a client-server arrangement
[16:45:35] <bertieb> the application uses BGRX on the server-side, sends that as a data packet to the client, which decodes it (expecting BGRX) and for some reason gets GBRP9LE
[16:45:51] <bertieb> which to me seems odd
[16:47:52] <mingalsuo> Hi! I'm slowing down material from 25 to 23.976fps with complex_filter. I tried adding '[0:s:0]setpts=25/\(24000/1001\)*PTS[s]' to the filter which gets a hold of a dvd_subtitle -stream but which is passed on to libx264 instead of dvdsub -encoding. Any ideas how I could get the subtitle also slowed down and added in one fell swoop?
[16:47:53] <bertieb> and didn't happen pre 4.4
[16:49:12] *** Joins: drathir_tor (~drathir@wireguard/tunneler/drathir)
[16:50:20] <bertieb> so if I understand the bit you quoted, we basically say "We think it's in BGRX", libavcodec overrides that and says "actually it's in GBRP9LE" and so output frames in that format
[16:50:47] <JEEB> yes
[16:51:11] <bertieb> cool, thanks for confirming :)
[16:51:37] <bertieb> now just need to figure out where along the line that format is getting introduced
[16:52:27] <bertieb> because -- I'm told, haven't read that part fo the code yet -- the client and server do content negotiation as to what encoders and formats are acceptable
[16:54:14] <bertieb> (I guess the other approach is just have the client accept GBRP9LE, and csc it to another format; but that feels like it might be slower performance-wise)
[16:55:04] <bertieb> cheers!
[16:56:52] <JEEB> bertieb: you can do `git grep "BGRX"` in FFmpeg :)
[16:57:29] <JEEB> so not only are there no references to that pix_fmt in the H.264 decoder, there are very few references at all ;)

[17:02:16] <bertieb> Ah, nice tip!
[17:03:09] <bertieb> Yeah, there are very few; there are more for BGR0 which it seems this application 'wants' to ultimately decode to (?? at a guess based on its error output: "unknown output pixel format: GBRP9LE, expected BGR0 for 'BGRX'"); I wonder why it uses BGRX

[17:07:43] <bertieb> I suspect it's something to do with acquisition format; it seems (if a comment is to be believed!) that the representation there is BGRA
[17:08:15] <JEEB> not surprising
[17:08:20] <JEEB> normal RGB cases are usually packed
[17:08:26] <JEEB> but H.264 is decoded planar
[17:08:27] <JEEB> :P
[17:09:11] <bertieb> ahh
[17:09:22] <bertieb> yeah this is starting to make sense (to me anyway)
[17:09:56] <bertieb> BGRA/X acquired → sent for encoding → transmitted → decoded as GBRP9LE
[17:10:33] <bertieb> it used to be decoded as GBRP8 but a change means it's being decoded as GBRP9LE
[17:10:47] <bertieb> (presumably precision related?)
[17:12:05] <bertieb> sinec on the client side (where there's more likely to be video hardware) shaders can do conversions from GBRP8

[19:21:29] <sgon> msmith12[m]: Thank you very much for your time and help.
[19:22:52] <msmith12[m]> feel free to come back here, or dm me anytime. You can also try emailing ffmpeg-user mailing list since others (like Hoyos) hang out there.
[19:23:41] <sgon> Got it.Thanks a lot. =D (y)
[19:23:55] <msmith12[m]> ffmpeg and gstreamer are great tools, they can do almost everything. Again, http://alfg.dev/ffmpeg-commander is a great site if you need help with making your FFcommands

[21:31:26] <Wieku> Hi, I have a hard time understanding how `-pix_fmt` works for output. I'm using ffmpeg cli n4.4-80. I dump rgb24 frames through named pipe and encode them with h264_nvenc and noticed a strange(?) behavior. When I put `-pix_fmt=yuv444p`,  encoding speed is ~2.8x and resulting video weights 52MB. When I put `-pix_fmt=yuv420p`, encoding speed is
[21:31:26] <Wieku> ~2.75x and resulting video weights 37.5MB (as expected, 75% size reduction per frame). But when I remove -pix_fmt argument, encoding speed reaches 4.2-5x and resulting video weights 37.6MB (so it seems it's also in yuv420p, mediainfo confirms it). Is that a bug or something on my end? Thanks.

[21:32:17] <JEEB> Wieku: I think the nvidia encoder takes in RGB but encodes it as 4:2:0 (does the conversion automagically within the nvidia driver)
[21:32:26] <JEEB> which is why the h264_nvenc wrapper supports RGB
[21:33:02] <JEEB> of course it makes it now hard to actually implement 4:4:4 RGB encoding through those wrappers :P

[21:42:12] <eschie> bump:  is there any way to segment VOD demuxed HLS audio and video using the HLS demuxer?  currently my VIDEO streams are segmented EXACTLY but my audio streams vary above and below my EXT-T-TARGET-DURATION.  what am i missing?
[21:44:08] <eschie> also: can the HLS demuxer output audio streams in .aac format?  i'm trying to mimmic the output of this stream using ffmpeg:
[21:44:52] <JEEB> if you just want to dump an HLS stream it might make sense to just not utilize FFmpeg for it?
[21:45:44] <JEEB> since all you need are HTTP requests and parsing of HLS manifests (and writing read segments' bits out in manifest(s))
[21:46:27] <eschie> JEEB wdym by "dump"?  my source is mp4, 1 audio 1 video.  i have multiple other audio sources.  then i re-encode h264 and output HLS segments.
[21:46:43] <JEEB> oh
[21:46:56] <JEEB> demuxing means reading a muxed thing into packets :D
[21:47:10] <JEEB> that is why I parsed your thing as being on the reading side rather than on the writing side
[21:48:46] <eschie> JEEB sorry! i just mean HLS stream where audio and video are in separate streams and not in same .ts transport segments.

[22:04:32] <Wieku> JEEB so what you are saying is that if you put for example nv12 frame to nvenc it outputs nv12 encoded frame but when you put rgb24 frame it first converts to yuv420p and then encodes it? Do I understood it correctly?
[22:04:55] <Wieku> Did I understand*
[22:05:29] <JEEB> Wieku: the conversion is internal to the nvidia driver, it's what it does if you just pass an RGB frame to it
[22:05:38] <JEEB> but yes, it does 4:2:0 conversion internally

[22:28:36] <realies> kepstin, I'm trying with a custom ffmpeg binary today, and I think it may be related
