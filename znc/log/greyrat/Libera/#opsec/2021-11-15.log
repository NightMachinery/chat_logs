[00:56:58] <gartt> Never saw the point of encrypted flash drives. I'd rather trust a tool like GPG with AES to encrypt contents than the software on the thumbdrive
[00:57:36] <gartt> It's damn fast just using GPG, too. Maybe I'm missing something
[00:58:28] *** Quits: grobi (~grobi@user/grobi) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[01:18:27] <Fault> Speed is inconsequential when talking about security. Those hardware-encrypted drives have significantly smaller attack surfaces than software encryption methods. If an attacker cannot even see view the encrypted data you‚Äôre miles ahead already (and most hardware solutions have tamper mechanisms that‚Äôll wipe it on tamper too, your software
[01:18:27] <Fault> solution surely doesn‚Äôt have that)
[01:19:32] <gartt> Fault: It's a good point, but I remember articles of device-enforced encryption being compromised, but files simply encrypted with AES 256 using GPG have never been to my knowledge

[01:21:16] <Hydragyrum> luks is also nice
[01:21:57] <Fault> gartt: yeah I‚Äôm not saying they _have_, just that it‚Äôs significantly easier to _try to_. Again if an attacker doesn‚Äôt even have my encrypted blobs, they can‚Äôt even try to brute force them.
[01:22:08] <Hydragyrum> add in pam_duress or cryptsetup nuke passwords, detached luks headers, etc.
[01:22:55] <Joanna>  /msg _mobot last 50
[01:23:09] <gartt> Fault: I suppose so. But I'd rather trust something tried and true, and have the only worry being the password I use, which is fully in my control and responsibility :)

[01:24:01] *** Joins: grobi (~grobi@user/grobi)
[01:26:53] <Fault> Ok sure, but in the case of the device given as an example, what‚Äôs the difference? It uses only a password which is fully in your control and responsibility, and uses FIPS-140 certified hardware. Very much ‚Äútried and true‚Äù there‚Ä¶
[01:29:26] <gartt> As long as a few months from now they're not exposing a vulnerability for it at a conference due to hardware
[01:31:23] <Fault> Ok fair I read carefully enough and this particular device is using 140-3 which was only approved a couple years ago üòÅ But the FIPS-140 suite has been in place over two decades at this point, definitely not a spring chicken
[01:31:43] <Fault> *I _didn‚Äôt_ read carefully enough
[01:32:52] <gartt> It'll probably happen, but I'm just saying it's extremely unlikely that they'll find a serious vulnerability in AES using GPG while I've seen numerous hardware encryption devices exposed at conferences (*I* haven't seen, but seen the articles from this)
[01:33:39] <gartt> But like you said, it sound unlikely there will be any faults found with it, as the tech is well-tested
[01:35:47] <Fault> Yup and note that these devices do use AES for the actual data encryption too, meaning they benefit from the same strength-of-algorithm that GPG does. Just a smaller attack surface. But as you noted right off the bat, at the expensive of speed: if anything, getting the stupid password typed correctly on that keypad is annoying as hell üòù
[01:49:06] <Joanna> I‚Äôm surprised that people have to be told to backup data.. then again I‚Äôm not an optimist.
[01:51:29] <Hydragyrum> doomer view: who cares if I back up my data, it doesn't really matter anyway
[01:55:18] <Joanna> I‚Äôve had hard drive fail before and used cvs I think it was to restore
[01:56:53] <Joanna> I think a lot of people trust computers way too much..

[02:36:28] <DoseMeBoofy> I figured out how to shorten the kill chain by one link as an attacker, thereby decreasing the likelihood of getting caught in the cyber-killchain's "Act on Objective" step, which is often the step that leaves forensics.
[02:36:39] <DoseMeBoofy> You just never act on any objective

[22:26:57] <jan6> @your usb debate, the correct answer is to use BOTH hardware and software encryption ;P
[22:31:26] <jan6> unless the hardware and firmware are entirely open source, you can't actually be sure how secure the hardware really is (if they got certifications, then you at least know the general level, otherwise not even that), how do you know there's no potential overflow or backdoor or slight mishandling of data or whatever? maybe if you press a certain sequence of buttons it resets the password or unlocks
[22:31:26] <jan6> it without wiping data? maybe a certain input from computer will turn it into "debug mode" where it will accept commands signed with the manifacturer's key? etc
[22:31:38] <jan6> *ANYTHING* can be broken
[22:32:33] <jan6> maybe all it takes is opening the case without setting off the tamper alarms, to be able to use an UART terminal to get direct access?
[22:32:48] <jan6> you won't know it ahead of time
[22:33:21] <jan6> etc
[22:34:33] <jan6> while standards and protocols may be mathematically safe, real implementation often have bugs or problems, sometimes merely because the creator never anticipated X scenario even being a possibility
