[02:51:54] <pyzozord> myfunction is the real code you are testing

[02:58:45] <sgt_chuckles> i need advice. I'm trying to create a CLI application that generates a scaffold for a pre-made project template. But not sure whether to have the code generate the directories/files or clone the repo in a specified project name...

[02:59:08] <soulisson> Apologies for this question, my english is not very good. Is hooking a function to another function is "linking" my function to the original function somehow?
[02:59:12] <blahboybaz> cool. Now I feel a bit better about investing the time to read / learn about the stuff
[02:59:19] <blahboybaz> Thatns for the links
[02:59:45] <pyzozord> soulisson: only in the most colloquial and casual sense, but it is "creating a dependency"
[02:59:59] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: good luck

[03:01:06] <soulisson> pyzozord, ok, thanks a lot.
[03:01:25] <pyzozord> soulisson: no problem
[03:02:58] <soulisson> pyzozord, I saw basically whith some basically some analysis program who injects a dll, and basically attach his own functions to the original function
[03:03:19] <soulisson> sorry I can't type today, lol :)
[03:03:45] <pyzozord> soulisson: in that context it might actually be linking as in linking done by a linker. DLL stands for dynamically linked libraries

[03:05:43] <soulisson> pyzozord, hmm, no, it basically injects some code and patches the original function to jump to the hook which will log the arguments, before return returning to the original function
[03:05:48] <sgt_chuckles> creates the directory with project_name
[03:06:14] <pyzozord> sgt_chuckles: oh I see what you mean, simple copy, more smarter generation with variables and options
[03:06:23] <pyzozord> sgt_chuckles: well depends on your needs
[03:06:50] <sgt_chuckles> it will generate a dockerfile with directory specific to that project
[03:07:10] <sgt_chuckles> a docker-compose...a circleci yaml config file
[03:07:19] <pyzozord> soulisson: this acutally could be linking, I'd suggest you wait for someone more experience with compilers, or ask in #c++ or #c

Ie, plug it in (and you'd know what port it is because you'd have read the printed documentation, back in those days you had printed documentation), and then you'd load up your program and tell the program to use the specified port and

[06:12:31] <arahael> soulisson: Generally in the case of sql injection, the fix is not to allow sql injection and to treat all inputs as untrusted.  If a person's name is '; drop tables bobby;', then insert that as-is as the actual name field, as a string. Because that's what it is.
[06:12:51] <phogg> s/tables/table/ but yes

[06:14:51] <phogg> a good DB interface would also save you from that kind of injection
[06:14:55] <soulisson> arahael, I understand that. My question was more related to classification algorithms in machine learning.
[06:15:03] <phogg> but so will bind parameters. SQL injection is a solved problem
[06:16:05] <soulisson> phogg, it's a solved problem if the dev knows about it, in 2021 there are still sql injections vulnerabilities that lead to data breach, etc

[06:17:41] <soulisson> phogg, there are less than before that's for sure but most schools in my country don't teach about security practices. So a lot of applications are insecure generally speaking.
[06:17:43] <arahael> soulisson: The better solution, imho, is to audit the libraries to ensure that they don't do sql injection.
[06:18:03] <arahael> soulisson: And likewise, the apps too.
[06:18:16] <soulisson> phogg, you've also second order sql injections which are harder to detect.
[06:18:30] <phogg> soulisson: it's still a solved problem in that the problem is known, the solutions are known, and all it takes is simply application of standard practices. This makes SQL injection very different from many kinds of programming error (and very different from most security vulnerabilities)

[06:37:49] <arahael> soulisson: Unfortunately, it comes down to this: Does the application or its libraries have sql injection vulns? If yes, then *all input* can be regarded as potential sql injection.  Your algorithm should then be: func couldExploitSqlInjection(inputString) -> Bool { return true }
[06:38:47] <arahael> soulisson: Trying to patch things up is what makes for a clusterfuck, you have to actually fix the problem in the first place.
[06:39:39] <arahael> soulisson: As a case in point, some well known stateful http proxy suddenly decided to block anything that looks like a credit card number.  Suddenly, we got reports that our application, which does not process credit cards, would randomly fail.

[13:49:54] <arahael> Lyn: I'd say microservices can process multiple methods, etc, but you will want to group them by role/responsibility.  It makes sense to have "account management" be separated from "general user data".
[13:50:12] *** Quits: absc (~absc@access03.colt-engine.it) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[13:50:17] <pyzozord> Lyn: usually in microservice architecture there is a single microservice responsible for "accounts" you can split that further if you are netflix or amazon, but even medium size businesses probably don't need to
[13:50:28] <pavonia> ZenixOwler: I would use form + submit to increase accessibility, because that will also work without JS
[13:50:41] <elf_fortrez> i guess microservice is a bad name

[14:39:31] <leduyquang753> I imagine the server keeps a record of valid client data, when you request a logout it simply marks them as invalidated.
[14:39:41] <W> ZenixOwler, it probably does both, instructs the browser to reset the cookie content, and mark the token as expired
[14:40:08] <leduyquang753> That should explain how you can request a "log out of all devices" too.
[14:40:15] <ZenixOwler> yea ok then
[14:40:24] <pulse> hmm, which app has log out of all devices
[14:40:34] <W> note that some websites only does the *former*, it's not given that any database update happens on logout
[14:40:41] <ZenixOwler> but yea, i tried to pop up a data from my session in flask but the cookie when i try to view in the developer toolset on Chrome, doesn't have anything such as "Expired : CHECKED" or so on

[14:43:56] <W> Note also that there's a variety of "sessions" possible, what's actually given is just cookies and other http content, many many things can be implemented on top of that.

[14:52:45] <piou> sure, I won't bother you with that, but it's important so I just wanted to be sure that it was somewhere at the back of your mind :)
[14:53:15] <ZenixOwler> yea but this cookies and sessions concept is still a bit vague at some point tho, because flask already abstracts them all too much
[14:53:37] <ZenixOwler> should have began with PHP first since it doesn't highly abstract this process according to what i was told
[14:53:57] <piou> Flask is nice but the moment you add users there's a whole lot of possible issues that can arise and at that point I'd rather go with something more integrated like django
[14:54:23] <piou> Which admitedly abstracts even more, but being too hands on is detrimental to web security in general
[14:54:27] <ZenixOwler> yea but django is very huge btw, i began with flask first
[14:54:56] <ZenixOwler> but also, flash is already huge enough so :P

[16:13:03] <pikapika> so I think it should be 1?

[16:18:27] <xerxes> pikapika: this is not a bug, sure. i just assumed that when the manual said that `isalpha(int c)` returns true if the argument is a character, it actually returns 1. it doesn't have to.
[16:19:19] <pikapika> Obviously any non-zero value is true for C
[16:19:29] <pikapika> Why it returns 1024 therefore must imply some optimization most probably
[16:20:29] <xerxes> pikapika: it is. GNU libc implementations are never quite straightforward, unlike musl libc. but it's heavily optimised.
[16:20:47] <pikapika> Optimized code is usually longer than unoptimized
[16:21:07] <pikapika> But also code simply written with a view to be simple and short is often faster than heavily bloated unoptimized code
[16:21:38] <pikapika> Good optimized code faster then simply short and simple code faster than bloated unoptimized code
[16:22:22] <pikapika> Does alpine use musl
[16:23:13] <xerxes> pikapika: musl libc has simplicity as a goal in mind. GNU libc was written at a time where any remote similarity with UNIX (TM) codebases could invite costly litigation. so they evolved to be different. if the UNIX implementation optimised space, the GNU implementation optimised time.
[16:23:21] <xerxes> pikapika: yes, Alpine uses musl libc.
[16:23:32] <pyzozord> isn't -1 just all bits flipped on?

[17:06:50] <pikapika> I can completely understand why some people are drawn to murder and rape, likewise why some are drawn to fascism

[17:10:33] <pikapika> src, I really can't understand the attraction to a system where the only chance of having a decent life is being lucky enough to one of the 0.001% who are the ruling class. Its a simple statistical fact that most of these footsoldiers will be one of the commoners rather than one of the rulers.

[17:14:20] <pikapika> pulse, its far from long term thinking
[17:15:06] <TheLinuxNerd> fascism is a short-term "solution", its only arguments derive from hatrid, its "gospel" is spread through indoctrination
[17:15:08] <pikapika> My view is that we should round up supporters of fascism, and give them what they want...good and hard
[17:15:18] <edgar-rft> pikapika: you're only envious because you're a low-class person :-)
[17:15:20] <pulse> pikapika, that makes you a fascist ;)
[17:15:26] <pulse> you gotta rise above the problem to solve it
[17:15:41] <pikapika> edgar-rft, everyone is aside from the fuhrer and a few of his inner circle
[17:15:46] <TheLinuxNerd> pikapika rounding people up is a fascist "solution"
[17:15:58] <pikapika> TheLinuxNerd, pulse we are just giving them what they want
[17:16:12] <pikapika> If they love fascism so much, they should be very happy at us for providing their dream life to them
[17:16:26] <pulse> what they want is what everyone wants. to be secure, loved, and to have a sense of belonging
[17:16:51] <pikapika> Bullshit, they want authoritarian rule so we should give them authoritarian rule good and hard
[17:16:59] <pulse> i'm not defending fascism but it's fairly obvious why it exists
[17:18:12] <src> pikapika: your platitudes coupled with your assuredness really are frustrating, but luckily I can't afford being drawn into a discussion right now

[17:19:16] <TheLinuxNerd> pikapika woah woah woah, calm down pal, no need to get emotional about it
[17:19:25] <arahael> Can I suggest that we stop with the ageist retorts.
[17:19:47] <pikapika> TheLinuxNerd, there is no emotion involved. I am in fact just suggesting giving fascists exactly what they want.

[17:23:43] <pulse> it's fine for small scripts i suppose :p
[17:24:01] <pyzozord> I just wrote scripts that runs each integration test and then another specific test to see if it's broken.
[17:24:08] <pikapika> But this is the same as saying we shouldn't arrest criminals, just let them be and they will get good
[17:24:09] <pulse> i still have PTSD from my OS professor requiring us to write a fully functional ~300 line bash script that did something a C program could do in 5 lines of code
[17:24:15] <pyzozord> some of these damn tests when run breaks later another test for all consecutive runs
[17:24:25] <pyzozord> so i wrote a brute force bash script to find it
[17:24:30] <pulse> pikapika, let's not have this discussion here, it's useless and is bound to result in anger

[17:24:53] <pulse> TheLinuxNerd, yes. whenever i see a bash if i cry internally
[17:25:06] <arahael> pulse: But did you have to write a 'pipeline'?  I hear that one unix pipeline is equivalent to a 1000 lines of C.
[17:25:28] <pyzozord> pulse: bash is annoyingly different than anything normal, but it is quite powerful to have a "scripting language for your os"
[17:25:28] <pulse> no it was some text processing but the catch was we weren't supposed to use standard programs that would make it easy
[17:25:38] <edgar-rft> Let's terrorize people with brute force bash scripts...

[19:42:23] <Pickchea> Whenever I install something from source (usually C/C++), I see a billion warnings rolling over my screen. Why is it so common to include all kinds of compiler warnings and regard none of them?
[19:42:41] <pikapika> gcc warnings are a subtle matter
[19:44:16] <Pickchea> I understand that some warnings can safely be disregarded but what is the point in not suppressing so many warnings that an actual important warning is impossible to catch?
[19:44:18] <woggle> Pickchea: It's likely that the software was developed with a compiler/standard library (e.g. older version) that gave fewer or different warnings. But also some developers don't look at the warnings as much as they should.
[19:44:48] <edgar-rft> C/C++ is soooo full of errors that people have given up to write correct code :-)

[19:57:50] <Thedarkb-Desktop> Everything sucks in its own way.
[19:58:02] <CodePoint> pikapika, I knew a dev -- a senior engineer -- who devoutly believed that Java was better because "... you didn't have to manage memory!".  2 weeks later he was strapped for time trying to find a memory leak... in the company's java software.
[19:58:18] <CodePoint> it was great.
[19:58:21] <pikapika> Exactly. Memory management is actually far harder in gc languages.
[19:58:29] <edgar-rft> pikapika: I agree that only some have an irrational, but the majority has a rational hate of C and C++ :-)
[19:58:35] <pikapika> Because its a complex black box now
[19:59:42] <CodePoint> My experience has taught me that the automatic design pattern is far simpler, and generally results in less errors.  When errors are produced it is usually more easy to pinpoint them.  It's still hard, but not as hard as when it's hidden behind a GC and a bunch of abstraction.
[20:00:40] <CodePoint> pikapika, ironically the memory leak actually came directly within the JavaFX library: code produced by Oracle!
[20:01:41] <pikapika> CodePoint, exactly
[20:01:48] <pikapika> In C you know where the mallocs and frees are

[20:06:37] <pikapika> InPhase, exactly what I meant. Its very explicit there.
[20:07:00] <InPhase> pikapika: But with the consequence that a huge fraction of C code bugs are from people needing to know where all the mallocs and frees are, but actually not.
[20:07:30] <InPhase> I greatly prefer the C++ middle ground, where this is accessible and abstractable away.
[20:07:31] <pikapika> Thats also true. But as I was hinting, when there's actually a memory bug, its far harder to find out and fix in a gc lang.
[20:07:45] <pikapika> And might even need "blessed" edits from the maintainers of the language itself

[21:49:41] <InPhase> blahboybaz: It additionally requires a lot of language support for locking things down heavily.  The idea is that anything that can go wrong should either trigger a compile error (plan A), or show up very rapidly with a detailed error report of what went wrong and where upon usage testing.
[21:50:07] <mrig> pyzozord: you've borders with Germany too, that's pretty close for you, did you experience the storms?
[21:50:29] <pyzozord> mrig: nope, nothing on my side beyond a couple of days rain
[21:50:36] <InPhase> blahboybaz: Of course this requires unit testing of the pieces providing the guarantees on which such behavior is built, so you can't go completely without testing if you want reliability.  But you can shift where it's efficient to test, and how, by architectural decisions.

[21:53:29] <InPhase> blahboybaz: What you have to mostly think of instead is every allowed input/result for every piece of the code, and lock all possible inputs down to a well-defined result (even if that result is a useful error state with guaranteed consequences).  Then you keep building up layers of this.
[21:54:22] <blahboybaz> InPhase: makes sense

[21:55:10] <blahboybaz> uh, not 'functionality' but useage
[21:55:17] <InPhase> blahboybaz: It can fall apart whenever you have a piece grabbing access to some large amount of complicated input, like settings or some intricate object with a lot of parameters.  So you really want to minimize places where that happens, because they become harder to validate in this approach.

[22:40:47] <meleoron> i'm trying to learn C. is returning a local array from inside a function "undefined behaviour" in C? i have a function `int * f() { int a[10]; return a; }` and if i call it as `int *p = f();` would the values of expressions `a` and `p` guaranteed to be the same?
[22:41:17] <meleoron> i know the array `a` is destroyed.
[22:41:27] <meleoron> i'm trying to be clear on what is returned.
[22:41:43] *** Joins: penguino (~mrpenguin@user/mrpenguin)
[22:41:47] <meleoron> i know that `*p` would probably lead to a segfault.
[22:42:11] <quippy> my C is rusty but I believe you get a dangling pointer and yeah, if you tried to dereference it you'll segfault
[22:42:15] <GeDaMo> A will be allocated on the stack, that will be overwritten, it's not safe to return
[22:42:21] *** Joins: silverwhitefish (~hidden@47.202.102.10)
[22:42:39] <quippy> right, you have to call malloc() to put it on the heap
[22:43:15] <meleoron> as i said, i know that. but it says in the specs that a `return x;` shall copy the value of `x`. in this case, would the value of `p` and `a` be the same?
[22:43:22] <GeDaMo> *p likely wouldn't cause a segfault
[22:43:37] <jeaye> It's UB, not a segfault.

[22:44:23] <xeno> it would likely work as long as you didn't make a new function call
[22:44:44] <GeDaMo> Depends how you define 'work' :P
[22:44:52] <meleoron> because if i run `printf("%p\n", a)` from inside the function, it spits an address value. but if i run `printf("%p\n", f());` it spits out (nil) consistently.
[22:45:09] <meleoron> as i see it, the former is `a` and the latter is `p`.
[22:45:43] <GeDaMo> Depends on what optimizations the compiler applies
[22:45:58] <pyzozord> yeah sounds like UB
[22:46:00] <xeno> Guest9: it would contain the same data, be possible to update and all, but be overwritten with the return address and possibly parameters of the next function call

[22:47:29] <meleoron> if it's UB, then there's no point questioning the logic because the compile can do whatever it wants, right. it doesn't have to copy a local pointer in return if it knows it's a pointer to local automatic variable like a local array or int. i mean GCC even gave me a warning. right?

[23:31:46] <pikapika> jeaye, some people are philosophers
[23:31:53] <pikapika> Its a valid field of study
[23:32:14] <pikapika> But I contend mathematics and programming are not fields that require it
[23:32:43] <jeaye> Why are you pinging me about this?
[23:32:53] <pikapika> Are you a philosopher?

[23:35:49] <pikapika> mathAndRhetorics, my immediate view as of now is I am not a philosopher
[23:36:17] <pikapika> And I think it is more useful to take a stance of practicality than one of philosophy/theology in mathematics

[23:37:15] <mathAndRhetorics> on Windows 10, I've coded client/server socket apps in Java. The server accepts a connection and reads. The client connects to the server and sends bytes using BufferedOutputStream. Any ideas why a benchmark shows that 100_000 messages takes 3s, and another day, same code, same computer, shows that it's for example 10 seconds?
[23:37:55] <pikapika> What else is running? You don't have to answer, even if nothing else was, Windows 10 has a thing where it randomly shoots up disk and sometimes cpu usage.
[23:38:03] <pikapika> Due to some internal services
