[00:01:43] <Karel> I have a bit of an issue with my .gitignore file not working, see this screenshot of my terminal: https://i.imgur.com/VW7lqap.png. I'm ignoring /rust/target, which was an untracked folder, but git still suggests to add it! What would be going on here?

[00:58:53] <osse> Other than that I don't know how it could have happened.
[00:58:57] <Karel> Ah and it even extra malicious since it adds a byte order mark so the file can't even be "mistaken" as utf-8.
[00:59:00] <Karel> Yeah that's what I did

[01:08:11] <osse> looks like git just reads it "raw" and as such the encoding of the file should match the encoding of the filenames
[01:09:15] <osse> NTFS stores them as UTF-16 but I guess there is some mingw madness involved
[01:09:58] <osse> or windows madness
[01:10:50] <Karel> Isn't file encoding always handled by the program? You always just read bytes, right?
[01:11:03] <osse> yes

[01:11:44] <osse> I'm not 100 % sure they do
[01:12:20] <osse> but the contents of the .gitignore are filenames

[02:45:14] <christall> I have a coworker attempting a fairly gnarly rebase that isn't behaving the way we expected it to. We managed to get things functional by manually patching the instructions but I'm intrigued to know how to get things right "the first time".

[02:49:12] <christall> Scenario is as follows (roughly): We use a daggy fix process to fix bugs. This bug was fixed as a child of it's origin commit (~5 years back), there are then multiple points in the history where changes were made that interact with the bug. These commits were merged in to the bug-branch in sequence and then further bug fix commits made to correct things. This entire sequence was then PRed against main. Upon review corrections were needed in t
[02:49:12] <christall> he original fix commit. We attempted to rebase these changes using `git rebase -r -i --onto <sha1-of-origin-bug> main` This *mostly* worked but the final merge instruction was wrong.

[02:50:36] <thiago> merge or rebase, never both
[02:50:43] <christall> The final merge command was rendered as `merge -C <sha1-of-current-merge onto # ...` where `onto` was a label created at the start of the rebase (and hence pointed to the original bug commit).
[02:52:03] <christall> by replacing that label with the SHA1 of the original merged commit the rebase works perfectly. What command am I missing to reconstruct that operation sequence correctly in the first place.

[02:56:30] <thiago> you said a fix was required. Ok.
[02:56:32] <christall> so I have *lots* of release lines
[02:56:38] <thiago> then you said a change to the fix was required. Ok.
[02:56:43] <thiago> where does the rebase show up?
[02:57:22] <thiago> when I have to maintain N old lines, I see one of two strategies:

[02:57:58] <thiago> 1) make the fix to the oldest release still in maintenance, then apply the fix there (that's where the PR targets), then merge that release to the next, and so forth until the newest
[02:58:06] *** Joins: frobnic (fb@b2b-130-180-11-14.unitymedia.biz)
[02:58:22] <thiago> 2) make the fix against the newest release and apply the fix there (that's where the PR targets), then cherry-pick the approved fix to all past releases, one by one
[02:58:34] <thiago> your case is closest to #1
[02:58:41] <thiago> there's no merge or rebase involved, though

[03:00:40] <thiago> yeah, like I said, I would not follow this procedure in the first place
[03:01:28] <thiago> but if you are doing the fix closest to the point where it was introduced, you must first accept the fix in the oldest branch that it is applicable for, not the newest (I assume "main" is newest)

[03:03:13] <thiago> let's say you're maintaining releases 1 through 9 and the bug was introduced between releases 2 and 3
[03:03:59] <thiago> option 1 is to fix the bug at release 3's current state, then merge 3 into 4, 4 into 5, and so forth until 9 merges into main
[03:04:30] <thiago> option 2 is to fix it in main's state, then cherry-pick that fix into 9, then cherry-pick 9's fix into 8, and so forth until a cherry-pick is made into 3
[03:04:32] <christall> that merge also merges everything else in 3 in to 4 etc...
[03:04:37] <thiago> yes
[03:04:51] <thiago> I assume all bugfixes in 3 are applicable to 4
[03:05:26] *** Joins: The_Blode (~Blode@user/the-blode/x-7164444)
[03:05:31] <christall> okay - I can see why most of 3 might be applicable in 4
[03:06:02] <thiago> if you follow this on an on-going basis, any bug fix that isn't applicable is simply an empty merge

[03:07:29] <thiago> since 4 started as 3 (it's a branch), this should work
[03:07:51] <christall> so you can never remove a feature from a release without having to make sure that every dev knows to watch out for each bug-fix reintroducing it?
[03:07:55] <thiago> usually, you don't add features to maintenance releases
[03:08:19] <thiago> if you have to remove a feature from an old release but you don't want that to propagate to the next one, then you make an empty merge that does not remove it
[03:09:54] <thiago> that's the same as applying a bugfix to an older release that isn't applicable to newer ones. Once you reach the release that isn't affected by the bug, the merge becomes empty since there's nothing to do.
[03:11:46] <christall> I mean I can see how this works I dislike the side-effects and it feels slightly abusive, so conceptually I prefer the way we currently do it... my only real problem I have is I can't get the git rebase command to generate the correct operation sequence for my scenario.
[03:11:59] <thiago> it's how git was designed
[03:12:06] <thiago> it was designed to work the way I've just described

[03:12:20] <thiago> I still don't see where a rebase is necessary
[03:12:45] <thiago> even in your scenario, you'd make the PR first against the oldest branch that the fix applies to. That's where the review would find that changes are necessary.
[03:12:53] <thiago> The developer then updates the PR.
[03:12:56] <thiago> no rebases necessary
[03:13:16] <thiago> only after that PR is accepted should the next branch be merged, with a new PR and a new review

[03:15:13] <christall> okay - let me be more concrete. There is a bug in the contract of an interface type Foo introduced in commit 'A'. You fix that bug in it's only concrete impl by creating a child commit of 'A'. At some time later in the history a new concrete type of Foo is introduced that exhibits the same bug - you merge this new commit in to the bug branch and fix as a child. Repeat as necessary. PR the result in to main.

[03:17:01] *** Joins: seand (~seand@69.54.136.33)

[03:17:23] <thiago> second, don't create the fix as a child of its first commit. Create it as the state of that branch that the fix applies to.
[03:18:07] <christall> Sorry, I don't want to discuss the merits of our bug fix workflow. I want to discuss how to rebase a sequence of commits that looks like I just described.
[03:18:09] <thiago> this way, if the PR requests changes, there are no merges to be reapplied
[03:18:26] <thiago> I understand. But I am saying the best way to avoid a rebase-merge issue is to not have them in the first place.
[03:18:31] <thiago> I've never had much luck with them
[03:18:48] <thiago> there is no solution to give you because it's not something git is good at or designed for
[03:18:58] <thiago> if you choose to keep this workflow, you choose to keep having these problems
[03:19:11] <christall> Okay... so then why does git rebase have a --rebase-merges option?
[03:19:15] <thiago> my advice from 16 years of git use is to avoid the problem in the first place
[03:19:29] <thiago> because people want to do that. It doesn't mean it's a good idea or well-supported.

[03:24:58] <christall> I mean the reality is that daggy fixes work very well for us and have distinct advantages when maintaining very large numbers of codelines and tracking which bugs exist where and which have been fixed where. For us, all of that upside is not worth sacrificing to make the occassional complicated merge easier to fix. Most of the time we integrate these daggy fixes using integration branches but the complex nature here made this approach easier
[03:24:58] <christall> to track.

[11:51:56] <gitinfo> Rewriting public history is not recommended. Everyone who has pulled the old history will have to do work (and you'll have to tell them to), so it's infinitely better to just move on. If you must, you can use `git push --force-with-lease <remote> <branch>` to force (and the remote may reject that, anyway). See http://goo.gl/waqum

[12:46:24] <Tuor> Hi, I did a couple of commits in a seperate branch called docs2 (I didn't push them) and I would like to squash them all together into one commit and write a new commit message. There is a second branch (pushed) which doesn't have all my changes, it's called upstream. docs2 was based on upstream and I could fast forward upstream to docs2, but I don't want to have all the commit messages. I tried to `rebase -i upstream` (from docs2) and I selected every commit but
[12:46:24] <Tuor> the oldest as fixup and selected reword for the oldest. I could then write a new commit message, but after that I had to resolve conflicts. I don't want to resolve conflicts, I just want one commit that has the same state as the branch currently has. I never had to resolve conflicts to make my changes. Why should I now suddenly have to resolve conflicts? I can also push that branch onto github if it helps.

[12:51:25] <osse> Tuor: you could git reset --soft HEAD~n && git commit
[12:51:55] <osse> if you get conflicts the way you describe it sounds a bit like there are merge commits in docs2

[13:02:32] <Tuor> that's a nice shorthand! :)
[13:08:07] <Tuor> That's like keep the files in the tree but move the current branch to upstream. Then I can just commit the state I have in the tree and it's all one commit. :)

[22:56:50] <gitinfo> [!eekaconflict] Merge conflicts are a natural part of collaboration. When facing one, *don't panic*. Read "How to resolve conflicts" in man git-merge and http://git-scm.com/book/ch3-2.html#Basic-Merge-Conflicts then carefully go through the conflicts. Picking one side verbatim is not always the right choice! A nice video explaining merge conflicts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz7NuSCH6II
