[00:42:00] <Brekkjern> Man. New speakers and moving the old ones into rear speakers makes the home cinema so much more fun
[00:45:59] <gwozniak> Just got something sent to me by my manager that was encrypted.  We use Outlook at work.  It was a PDF.  I couldn't view it in the Outlook app on macOS.
[00:47:11] <gwozniak> I had to log in to the web app.  And downloading it to view it outside of the email app did not work.  It is "Azure protected" so I had to view it in the web app (or some other special app on a phone or Windows)
[00:47:42] <gwozniak> "Save to PDF" when printing solved it, but man, really obnoxious

[17:43:08] <gwozniak> g'morning
[18:13:04] <Church> Yo
[18:20:40] <gwozniak> I have to explain why commenting out code and not removing it is the preferred course of action in this code review
[18:20:52] <gwozniak> Ag... backwards
[18:21:04] <gwozniak> Why commenting out is bad and removing is better
[18:24:50] <Church> Fun...
[18:24:55] <Church> I would hope that's a no brainer
[18:25:17] <gwozniak> Also, this person wants the ticket number in a comment by the change, which seems odd to me
[18:25:41] <gwozniak> We put the ticket number in each commit message...
[18:28:56] <edk> i am confused
[18:29:58] <edk> you're on the removing is better side?
[18:30:47] <gwozniak> Yes, I think removing the code is better than commenting it out
[18:30:55] <edk> oh good
[18:31:07] <gwozniak> I wrote it backwards in the original message
[18:31:13] <letoram> as a general principle or in this specific case?
[18:31:22] <gwozniak> In general
[18:33:12] <edk> yeah, commented out code should be the exception
[18:33:28] <edk> i mean it has to be the exception, otherwise any code file that gets changed will end up being mostly comment
[18:33:56] <gwozniak> The thing is, the files this person has touched over the years is littered with #if 0 stuff, and it's confusing as hell when you're trying to read things
[18:34:12] <edk> yeah
[18:35:00] <gwozniak> Putting ticket numbers in the comments... ehn
[18:35:12] <gwozniak> Maybe
[18:38:40] <letoram> think it is an 'early-stage vs late-stage' thing, code that managed to survive in its position for a while tend to have very interesting reasons as to why it suddenly needed to radically change or go away, some anchor as to the history / motivation can then be justified over trying to scrape it from git log.
[18:40:28] <gwozniak> Yeah, I can see that.  I don't object to commenting out sometimes.  Most of the time, though, it's not good to keep the old stuff around.

[22:52:42] <gwozniak> Maybe asking for the end of the world is not something we should consider wholesome or moral
[23:02:47] <companion_cube> that's because you're not going to heaven, gwozniak
[23:31:06] <defect> i have my doubts that a mega-church pastor would either, based on that whole camel through eye of a needle thing
[23:33:26] <gwozniak> One of my friends has gone "full Catholic" so I watched a couple sermons from the church he goes to.  It was striking to me how much they glorified the idea of being dead and then in heaven.  It really seemed to devalue life to me
[23:34:25] <gwozniak> And the Catholics aren't as all-in on the end of the world stuff as other versions of Christianity, as I understand it
