[00:00:12] <jfcaron> omg "tempatures"
[00:00:48] <Hawker> yeah
[00:00:50] <Hawker> it's... hot
[00:01:03] <Hawker> it burns my pi to a crisp but it can deal with it
[00:01:14] <jfcaron> Good for Canadian winters.
[00:01:29] <Hawker> lol yeah
[00:01:39] <Hawker> Basically I tell it to download everything from today
[00:01:46] <jfcaron> ah ok
[00:02:01] <Hawker> So it basically takes the date, formats it into a yt-dlp command, then runs it
[00:02:06] *** Quits: rouge (~rouge@gateway/tor-sasl/rouge) (Quit: leaving)
[00:02:18] <jfcaron> right, and since it's just today it's not checking the whole channel's video list
[00:02:20] <Hawker> If it sees it try to download something not from today, it'll break prematurely
[00:02:23] <Hawker> Yep
[00:02:36] <jfcaron> Mine used to check every single video for date and archive status, some channels have thousands of vids so it took hours to run.
[00:02:42] <Hawker> bc it actually will check all youtube videos otherwise
[00:02:49] <Hawker> yeah that's the issue
[00:02:57] <Hawker> so I threw in the break condition
[00:03:29] <Hawker> currently I want to set my pi up as a NAS... with USB 2.0 ports lol
[00:03:57] <jfcaron> Oh so your break on line 40 in downloadCheck.h could be instead by using the yt-dlp option --break-on-reject
[00:04:52] <jfcaron> but w/e works
[00:04:56] <Hawker> that's what you get when you code without reading the docks! XD
[00:05:05] <jfcaron> Where are you in Canadia?  I'm in Vancouver.
[00:05:40] <Hawker> I'm in the Atlantic provinces
[00:05:41] <Hawker> XD
[00:05:52] <Hawker> you should join #canada lol
[00:06:27] <jfcaron> I tried looking for regional channels back on FreeNode but I think they didn't allow them
[00:06:31] <jfcaron> I guess Libera is OK with them?
[00:07:45] <Hawker> ig
[00:07:58] <Hawker> personally if I use a channel I'm fine
[00:08:05] <Hawker> bc as long as I'm not the op
[00:15:33] <superkuh> They were allowed on freenode.

[11:45:32] <lunario> hi, so i want to find out the channel_id (the one always beginning with "UC") of any given video, but i dont want to download the video itself. I tried youtube-dl -s --output "%(channel_id)s" which is supposed to simulate downloading and just output the channel ID, but it says it is unable to extract it. if I do the same without -s (--simulate), it works, but then I download the video, which I
[11:45:34] <lunario> dont want. any suggestions?
[11:49:01] <lunario> ahh nvm, when i add --get-filename it works :)
