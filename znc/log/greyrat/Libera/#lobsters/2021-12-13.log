[22:13:49] <gwozniak> Yet more customer support stuff where the customer says "Your generated code sucks!" but is running at -O0
[22:14:13] <gwozniak> You have to wonder if anyone reads up on their tools sometimes
[22:15:12] <technomancy> I believe in that case you are well within your rights to reply with https://memegenerator.net/img/images/14817352.jpg
[22:17:23] <companion_cube> gwozniak: to be clear, you work on a gcc-based tool, right? that's a bit hilarious
[22:17:43] <gwozniak> Yes
[22:17:58] <gwozniak> This happens A LOT
[22:18:19] <companion_cube> yes, gcc is known for generating slow code ðŸ™„
[22:18:44] <gwozniak> In some cases, we're told that the customer refuses to use the optimizer, but insists on amazing code to be generated at -O0
[22:18:59] <pe> The customer's always right!
[22:19:08] <pe> Ship them a compiler that silently does -O3.
[22:19:18] <technomancy> tell them that it can only do that when the computer is turned off
[22:19:23] <gwozniak> They want -Os, not -O3
[22:19:36] <technomancy> once you turn on your computer, it's impossible to generate fast code at -O0, so you have to do it while it's turned off
[22:19:51] <companion_cube> gwozniak: â€¦
[22:19:53] <gwozniak> We will modify the compiler to consult them on every decision in the optimization stage
[22:20:00] <companion_cube> "just write amazing code then"
[22:20:23] <companion_cube> I wonder if the difference between -O1 and -O0, is bigger than -O1 to -O2
[22:20:47] <gwozniak> -O0 is pretty simple (and dumb) code, but it works
[22:21:19] <companion_cube> maybe you could ship tcc to these customers
[22:21:22] <companion_cube> much simpler!
[22:21:45] <gwozniak> I can check that, but my guess is that -O0 to -O1 is better than -O1 to -O2
[22:23:20] <gwozniak> -O0 has so many redundant loads and stores...
