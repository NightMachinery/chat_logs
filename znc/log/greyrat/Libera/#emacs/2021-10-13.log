[00:30:58] <Bayes> eh, LaTeX/P WK Anzu FlyC company Fill o_O
[00:31:14] <Bayes> so I guess it isn't?
[00:31:24] <pjb> If it's a major mode you can: M-: major-mode RET
[00:31:24] <TRS-80> Bayes: Look at source code for Auctex mode and search for "lighter"
[00:31:56] <TRS-80> there are bunch of *tex modes, I am not sure how or if they show up differently (I don'r use them)
[00:32:17] <TRS-80> Bayes: But generally you would need to define some file name regex to open certain mode automatically based on file name
[00:32:30] <Bayes> ah I'm in latex-mode according to M-: major mode
[00:32:43] <Bayes> yeah with use-package it's a bit more tricky than that

[00:33:48] <bpalmer> Bayes: look at the :mode argument
[00:33:54] <TRS-80> Anyway, the "normal" way would be to say something like `(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.beancount\\'" . beancount-mode))` which is for beancount (file like 'something.beancount') but you get the point

[02:40:03] <ruediger> Compu-Celebi: it doesn't really require configuration. C-c C-c will eval the buffer. There are more options, probably best to check out the Python menu in python-mode
[02:41:02] <Compu-Celebi> I already read the menu.
[02:42:11] <Compu-Celebi> Is "eval" intended to mean "execute"?
[02:42:26] <bremner> more or less
[02:42:53] <bremner> Compu-Celebi: have you tried it? did you get stuck somehow?
[02:42:55] <lampilelo> C-c C-c sends the whole buffer to the repl
[02:43:26] <Compu-Celebi> That is a strange choice of words but is possibly based on the fact that all instructions in Lisp are in the form of lists, which are evaluated to execute the instructions.

[02:44:55] <Compu-Celebi> It then instructed me to initiate the interpreter, with another item from that menu or its shortcut.
[02:45:07] <Compu-Celebi> I did so and then again instructed it to evaluate the buffer.

[02:46:20] <Compu-Celebi> However, strangely, it complained of a syntax error in a perfectly valid instruction.  IDLE does not complain about it.
[02:46:55] <Compu-Celebi> It is `path = f"{dir_name}/{filename}"`.
[02:47:34] <Compu-Celebi> Oh, the interpreter that was executed is for Python 2.7.17, instead of Python 3.6.9.
[02:47:37] <bremner> yep

[02:47:49] <technomancy> (it doesn't work in elisp)
[02:49:34] <Compu-Celebi> Why did it not prompt for which interpreter to execute?
[02:50:04] <ruediger> Compu-Celebi: it does for me when it starts the interpreter.
[02:50:14] <bremner> only the first time, I think
[02:50:22] <bremner> oh, maybe I customized it
[02:50:36] <bremner> M-x customize-group <return> python <return>
[02:51:19] <Compu-Celebi> Define "group" in context.
[02:51:24] <bremner> or M-x customize-variable <return> python-shell-interpreter <return>
[02:51:39] <bremner> I didn't know there was going to be an exam...
[02:51:56] <e1f> think of group as category
[02:51:58] <bremner> I'm giving you commands to try, if that's not obvious
[02:52:11] <Compu-Celebi> An item in the list that is accessed by executing the first sequence of instructions is Python Shell Interpreter.
[02:52:32] <e1f> it would be a mistake to try to make sense of emacs nomenclature in the context of today's meanings
[02:52:43] <Compu-Celebi> It seems that it is associated with the second name in the second sequence of instructions.

[05:00:57] <TRS-80> Well I gues sthat's how it works with a let also?  I mean not that I am some authority, but I just read in Let Over Lambdas that the way a let actually works is to save the original value, write new value in same place, and when let is over, write original value back in same place.
[05:01:35] <acdw> wait, I thought "Ensure" And "insure" meant two separate things
[05:01:40] <TRS-80> OMG
[05:01:50] <bpalmer> TRS-80: yes, it's precisely how let works, in traditional elisp. With lexical-binding: t , let on a new variable name produces a lexically local binding
[05:02:48] <TRS-80> bpalmer: So you are saying lexical binding works somehow differently?
[05:02:50] <bpalmer> This is why , in traditional elisp, (let ((a 1)) (lambda () (+ a 1)))  does not create a closure; the lambda it returns expects a dynamic value for a
[05:03:04] <TRS-80> ok go on
[05:03:16] <bpalmer> the let binding on a , however, goes away when you exit the let.

[05:05:28] <bpalmer> in lexical binding, (let ((a 1)) (lambda () (+ a 1)))  returns a lambda ; inside that let, a refers to a specific binding. The lexical scope mechanism sees the lambda refers to it, so keeps that binding around (inside a "closure")
[05:06:32] <TRS-80> yes I follow
[05:07:18] <TRS-80> I think it's a bit of a pedantic difference though, no?  I mean what other value for a could the lambda possibly get while inside a let?
[05:07:53] <TRS-80> maybe if you did like (setq a something) in between the let and the lambda?
[05:08:26] <TRS-80> I guess would be the only way to change "a"?
[05:08:47] <TRS-80> and only would work in case of traditional elisp / no lexical binding?
[05:09:53] <TRS-80> maybe I still don't understand, actually
[05:10:28] *** Quits: chep (chep@gateway/vpn/airvpn/chep) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[05:10:41] <TRS-80> OK I usually use lambdas inside something like mapcar where they actually get run, instead of just returned as a lambda
[05:10:48] <TRS-80> so maybe I just need to think in that more
[05:11:27] <TRS-80> so now with that in mind, maybe I start to understand
[05:12:16] <bpalmer> Yes. In traditional (dynamically scoped elisp), if you don't have a global a,  (funcall (let ((a 1)) (lambda () (+ a 1)))) is an error ("void variable a")
[05:13:05] <bpalmer> This is where it usually shows up: when a lambda or function is defined which references a non-global variable, and then used elsewhere.
[05:13:52] <bpalmer> In lexical binding, the local ("lexical") binding is captured and used; in dynamic binding, it just looks up the most recent, not yet exited binding for that variable.
[05:14:36] <bpalmer> Another way of looking as it is a separation between "spatial" local variables and "temporal" local variables. With lexical binding, variables are always looked up around where the function is defined. 
[05:14:40] <bpalmer> It's right by it in space.
[05:15:04] *** Joins: chep (chep@gateway/vpn/airvpn/chep)
[05:15:05] <bpalmer> With dynamic binding, variables are always looked up when the function is evaluated; the variable was set close by in time.
[05:16:17] <TRS-80> Oh so in your last example, "a" is not available to the lambda because it was not passed as an arg, is that right (eg. (lambda (a) ...)?
[05:16:52] <bpalmer> correct.
[05:16:52] <TRS-80> right, just like any other function?
[05:17:02] <TRS-80> it's just an anonymous function

[12:45:42] <pkal> It binds to indent-region
[12:45:48] <roxlu> oh ha! didn't know that
[12:45:57] <pkal> You can use that to highlight a function (C-M-h) then indent it.
[12:46:19] <roxlu> I've always used tab for that: select region, then TAB 
[12:46:25] <pkal> Though I have this function that I bind to M-q instead https://0x0.st/-0tQ.el

[14:59:01] <foo357> Hello. I'm thinking of trying out some new completion framework (helm, ivy, selectrum ... et.c.). I currently use IDO and I'm pretty happy with it, there are only two things I'm discontent with: M-x is unchanged, and I think the paradigm "space-separated components" would be neat to have.

[15:01:02] <_srji> <- use ivy
[15:01:58] <foo357> One thing I like about IDO is the discreetness, that it "lives" inside the minibuffer, as opposed to opening up a new window (when I read about the alternatives I get the impression that they normally generate a list that takes up a lot of screen space)
[15:02:58] <_srji> ivy uses the minibuffer too

[15:05:40] <_srji> i cant say, when i started to work using emacs i just did a random pick for a completion framework.

[16:43:30] <_73> Macbeth seeks out the witches who say that he will be safe until a local wood, Birnam Wood, marches into battle against him. He also need not fear anyone born of woman (that sounds secure, no loop-holes here). They also prophesy that the Scottish succession will still come from Banquo's son. Macbeth embarks on a reign of terror, slaughtering many, including Macduff's family. Macduff had gone to seek Malcolm (one of Duncan's sons who
[16:43:31] <_73> fled) at the court of the English king. Malcolm is young and unsure of himself, but Macduff, pained with grief, persuades him to lead an army against Macbeth.

[21:42:14] <sg2002> I know. You know how lisp programmers often times get the macro itch? You see a problem, go "oh, I can write a macro for this". But after some years you go "yeah, but like, why would I?"

[23:34:32] <krux02> I use a layout that uses caps lock for another layout of symbols
[23:34:43] <krux02> the layour with the programming symbols {}()][<> etc

[23:36:13] <rpav> krux02: probably not ;)
[23:36:15] <krux02> yeti, that one looks too much like a prop
[23:36:51] <artefact> why is there a spacebar?
[23:37:04] <ggoes> good question
[23:37:19] <yeti> that's what I don't understand too...  just 0 and 1 would be enough
[23:37:23] <krux02> it is a prop, it doesn't have the hammers either to type the 0 or 1
[23:37:40] <Catie> Space? I think you mean 00100000
[23:37:43] <artefact> ^
[23:38:06] <yeti> 0 1 cr lf spc ... just bloat
[23:38:23] <krux02> it also doesn't look like it could actually reach those spots on the paper for typing
[23:38:34] <krux02> there is just not enough space for it
[23:38:58] <yeti> that's like the space pics from nasa...   artists' renderings
[23:39:22] <krux02> yeti, the space pics from nasa are cool

[23:40:03] <yeti> nah
[23:40:18] <yeti> the real shots from mars... ok
[23:40:19] <krux02> A guy who did technical drawings for Nasa actually made the game "Abe Odyssee"
[23:41:15] <krux02> I've seen drawing for imagination on how live on different planet could look like, from before they found out that our solar system is pretty much dead except from earth
[23:41:32] <artefact> i remember the game. it traumatized me as a kid
[23:42:12] <yeti> nasa's main ission now is not to find life
[23:42:22] <yeti> imagine what would happen if that fails
[23:42:55] <dieggsy> wat

[23:43:23] <yeti> if they find life, it is amoral to exploit mars
[23:43:47] <yeti> so the wanted outcome is to find nothing or only fossils
[23:44:40] <dieggsy> besides the fact that I'm not sure I agree with the reasoning there, I think you strongly overestimate their sense of morality

[23:46:40] <yeti> but the PR would be easier if mars can be proven being a dead rock
[23:47:06] <artefact> nasa: merge master/for-nasa from mars
[23:47:07] <dieggsy> yeti if money always wins, then finding life wouldn't stop anyone. But i also seriously doubt there's a substantial number of scientists going "i seriously hope we don't find life" lol
