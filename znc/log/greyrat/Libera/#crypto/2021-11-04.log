[00:03:45] <yawkat> p2p skype was a mess
[00:03:57] <yawkat> only thing it achieved was leak ips to people

[00:05:17] <System_Error> web lost this ... and somehow skype started losing its momentum, as it no longer any better than competitors.
[00:06:25] <System_Error> cvmn> guess best banking could look a bit like bitcoin :). So nobody can freeze account or decide how can I spend my money, yay.
[00:06:56] <cvmn> yes, but not bitcoin.  imo bitcoin is destined to get doomed since it's deflationary.
[00:07:08] <cvmn> some crypto-currency, yes.  but not bitcoin or the other deflationary ones.
[00:07:52] <yawkat> The problem is that monetary policy requires information about the markets that cannot be purely on-chain. 
[00:08:00] <System_Error> well, it also been 1st of kind and e.g. pow choice proven to be not exactly best, asics caused some undesirable centralizaton effects
[00:09:05] <System_Error> as for deflation vs inflation... on its own inflation is kind of fraud to steal some money from their owners :)
[00:09:17] <System_Error> without owners doing anything, lol
[00:10:02] <cvmn> ideal money should promote circulating money to buy/sell stuff that makes the civilisation stronger, which implies demoting the opposite: long-term money storing.  bitcoin is just the opposite of ideal money.
[00:11:03] <System_Error> cvmn> its up to me what to do with my money... otherwise they're not really mine and someone trying to use them as tool to sockpuppet me.
[00:11:56] <cvmn> nothing is up to you, and you don't own anything.  you only lease resources temporarily.  you better do good when you lease resources.
[00:12:14] <yawkat> Inflation and deflation aren't as relevant as stability in either of them. This is what requires good monetary policy
[00:13:02] <yawkat> Nominal interest rates will adjust either way, but not if prices aren't predictable

[00:21:03] <cvmn> circular definition.
[00:21:03] <System_Error> Inflation system ensures it would be case.
[00:21:28] <cvmn> natural selection says slight inflation > deflation.

[00:24:07] <sarnold> System_Error: yes, telling your bank before you travel is the usual process
[00:24:57] <System_Error> sarnold> guess I'm much better off without these "usual processes". So ofc I moved most money away except something for immediate spendings.
[00:26:42] <cvmn> System_Error: logic is very clear that deflation is suicidal.  because deflation promotes not spending money to some degree.  in the long run, a civilisation that's using deflationary money will be less likely to engage in trade.  problem with this is that less trade means less work done, which means less advancement.
[00:26:43] <cvmn> tnen less advancement simply means:  getting conquered by a more advanced civilisation (aka your'e history
[00:28:03] <cvmn> this is why we're guaranteed that governments will systematically always oppose any deflationary currency as a matter of self defence to ensure their survival.  only exception is some outliers that commit the mistake of adopting the likes bitcoin

[00:28:44] <MacGyver> You'll never see the actual outcome because bitcoin technically isn't deflationary yet.
[00:28:54] <MacGyver> And it won't be for another 150 or so years.
[00:29:19] <yanmaani> there's a famous article somewhere talking about why GPG is totally broken and you shouldn't use it, ever, for like 500 reasons
[00:29:23] <yanmaani> anyone have the link?
[00:29:23] <yawkat> MacGyver: how so? 
[00:29:30] <yanmaani> searched "gpg is broken" and couldn't find it
[00:29:31] <MacGyver> But it currently behaves more like a security anyway, so, *shrug*.
[00:29:34] <System_Error> MacGyver> guess its good enough for me :)
[00:29:40] <MacGyver> yawkat: What's the miners reward if not literally printing money?
[00:30:00] <yawkat> MacGyver: deflation is defined by prices, not by a decreasing money supply
[00:30:15] <MacGyver> yawkat: There's two definitions of deflation.
[00:30:20] <MacGyver> Satoshi meant the one I'm using.
[00:30:31] <yawkat> Satoshi was an idiot
[00:30:34] <MacGyver> But either way, it behaves like a security right now.
[00:30:35] *** Quits: foxbox (cammy@user/cammy) (Quit: UwU)
[00:30:42] <System_Error> and prices are defined as what ppl willing to give for something. They're not set in stone either.
[00:30:47] <MacGyver> And, somebody finally asked a cryptography question, so I can now say this:
[00:31:00] <cvmn> MacGyver: how is it not deflationary given that the mining supply of bitcoins is reducing every few years?
[00:31:01] <MacGyver> I'd like to ask people to be mindful that the whole (de)centralized internet discussion was still relevant to cryptography but the off-topic line on monetary policy was crossed a while ago. So when someone does want to discuss cryptography, take it elsewhere, which is now.
[00:31:38] <yanmaani> "bitcoin as a monetary policy" is overdone by this point
[00:31:38] <yanmaani> you can observe that literally every country in the world that used to use gold no longer does
[00:31:59] <MacGyver> yanmaani: There's a few different articles that cover this, can you narrow it down at least a bit?

[00:34:42] <MacGyver> There's a few that come to mind, https://blog.gtank.cc/modern-alternatives-to-pgp/ and https://blog.filippo.io/giving-up-on-long-term-pgp/ and a third one that I have to find in my logs.
[00:35:09] <yanmaani> Thanks!
[00:35:33] <MacGyver> https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html
[00:36:08] <MacGyver> But all of those are mostly not "why do we want to move away" but more "what do you move away to, based on your usecase".
[00:36:22] <MacGyver> Though the last one is possibly the one you were looking for.
[00:36:58] <cvmn> i think we should drop tls, and instead let the server throw its public key.  client can cache the public key and compare it against reputation lists to confirm if server is legit.
[00:37:36] <System_Error> cvmn> TLS is kinda overengineered and scary stuff with plenty of room for abuse. It very hard to get it right.
[00:37:40] <yanmaani> I think Filippo's is the one I was thinking of, but it doesn't match 100% 
[00:37:48] <MacGyver> So you don't want to do away with TLS, you want to do away with the PKI?
[00:38:13] <cvmn> System_Error: yes.  also pki is a dishonest approach to offer security imo.
[00:38:25] <System_Error> it is!
[00:39:07] <System_Error> CA can forge identity of someone else at will. Some actually do.
[00:39:30] <cvmn> any ca.  like 300+ points of failure.  if anyone lies, the whole thing is broken.
[00:39:42] <MacGyver> Yeah, that's a known issue.
[00:39:53] <MacGyver> Look into DANE.
[00:40:15] <MacGyver> It basically allows the server operator to communicate through DNS which CAs are trusted for their domain.
[00:40:40] <cvmn> ew.
[00:40:59] <MacGyver> So now you need to break both DNSSEC and a TLS (sub-)CA to be successful.
[00:41:22] <cvmn> dnssec is a bad idea imo.
[00:41:38] <System_Error> or just seize control of domain... success :D
[00:42:05] <cvmn> why not just let server throw its public key to the client?  then let the client whitelist it, like ssh?
[00:43:14] <System_Error> selfsigned certs are a bit like that. But on first exchange we dont really know if its proper server or not
[00:43:38] <cvmn> we also don't know that with pki's 1st exchange of 300+ cas.
[00:44:23] <yanmaani> Theoretically, you could solve this problem with a blockchain, but you'd need to move the entire DNS system over.
[00:44:48] <MacGyver> You don't need a blockchain. Certificate Transparency already exists, domain operators can check.
[00:45:02] <System_Error> cvmn> do you by chance seen thing like namecoin? In principle publishing keys like this should work as well I guess
[00:45:50] <yanmaani> Yeah, if you're okay with a trusted authority, you're also good.
[00:47:35] <MacGyver> Well, not exactly -- all you need to trust is that the CA is set up s.t. they cannot issue a certificate that's left out of CT; which is a rather hard requirement from the browser/CA forum nowadays afaik.
[00:47:56] <MacGyver> But I could be mistaken and that we're not there yet.
[00:47:59] <cvmn> System_Error: interesting.  namecoin is news to me.
[00:48:02] *** Quits: igemnace (~ian@user/igemnace) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[00:48:23] <yanmaani> MacGyver: in theory, you could also have the browser keep the CT root
[00:48:27] <yanmaani> and then have the site send in Merkle proofs etc
[00:48:42] <cvmn> System_Error: is namecoin the simplest solution though?
[00:48:47] <yanmaani> but now you have the problem of "ensure there's not two conflicting CT roots"
[00:48:55] <yanmaani> which is probably easier, though.
[00:49:07] <yanmaani> cvmn: for whom?

[00:49:44] <cvmn> yanmaani: non-governmets.
[00:49:59] <System_Error> cvmn> blockchain can get away without central authorities. At quite heavy price tho.
[00:50:02] <yanmaani> Namecoin already exists today and can be used for TLS with excellent security properties. So in that regard it has a leg up on Certificate Transparency/DNSSEC-based solutions, which will only be fully implemented at some point in the future.
[00:51:32] <cvmn> System_Error: imo using a reputation list is cheaper.
[00:53:40] <System_Error> who's going to maintain reputation list and why they're supposed to be flawless?
[00:54:06] <cvmn> seen that firefox addon where it used to check certificates uploaded by people?
[00:54:12] <cvmn> nothing is flawless.  imo its just simpler this way.
[00:55:07] <cvmn> companies with multiple servers, each server will have its own public ip that keeps changing, but, the company should have 1 public key that signs those server public keys. 
[00:55:35] <System_Error> stuff like namecoin basically can claim "server named XXXX is key YYYY" and 1st to do this claim wins.
[00:56:04] <cvmn> but what's the cost?
[00:56:10] <System_Error> attempt to fake it means one should beat whole thing in computing PoW

[01:59:40] <caveman> i agree.
[01:59:46] <yanmaani> for PoS to work, you need to know which block signed by a certain key was first
[01:59:58] <yanmaani> and so, whatever solution you use for this, could just have been used for the transaction
[02:00:11] <Alipha> caveman: I've always thought that CAs should be restricted on what TLDs they can issue certs for. eg, a Canadian CA can't issue certs for .us domains
[02:01:08] <yanmaani> more specifically: I have $1 gazillion, I stake it and lock it up properly, I get my $whatever block reward, I cash everything out into real money. I now have "nothing at stake". I then go and use my keys, from back when they "represented" $1 gazillion, to sign whatever crap
[02:01:35] <yanmaani> now the problem a new entrant is faced with: which one of these blocks were made when my key really represented what money, and which were made post-compromise?
[02:04:13] <Peng> Alipha: The thing about that is .com is more important than any ccTLD
[02:04:38] <caveman> yanmaani: couldn't understand.  i guess 1st question is:  how does PoS work?
[02:05:05] <yanmaani> caveman: People "stake" money (cryptocurrency), then sign blocks.
[02:05:14] <yanmaani> If they sign incorrect blocks, they lose their money.
[02:05:52] <Peng> Alipha: Government-operated CAs have been constrained to their own ccTLDs once or twice, which is really not particularly good for anyone with a domain in that ccTLD anyway...
[02:06:04] <caveman> yanmaani: can you use your staked money for trade?  or is it frozen?
[02:06:36] <Alipha> yanmaani: all cryptocurrency has the issue of, if you own more than 50% of the compute power or more than 50% of the stake or more than 50% of whatever the cryptocurrency is based upon, you're able to subvert the blockchain

[16:52:51] <Alipha> yanmaani: if I'm understanding how PoS works correctly, the attack you proposed can't happen. If you throw blocks onto an old block in order to create a new chain to rewrite history, the other miners are going to ignore your chain because the miners only pay attention to the longest chain. So then you have to create a chain that's longest than the current longest chain. However, if you have, say, 60% of the
[16:52:53] <Alipha> stake, you can only create 60% of the blocks on the chain, which you will end up exceeding if you do this attack, which means again, the other miners will ignore your chain since your chain is invalid

[17:26:21] <yanmaani> Alipha: In theory, yes. But that only applies for the miners, i.e. everyone who is on the longest chain.
[17:26:46] <yanmaani> But if I'm just getting connected, I'm not synchronized yet.
[17:27:14] <yanmaani> In that case, what will happen is I might get bamboozled into their fake chain. And then I will not accept any corrections to this, because that was the one I saw first.
[17:28:05] <yanmaani> (And now you might say "but nobody ever turns off their computer and everyone was there from day 1," but in that case, you've changed the security model so drastically you don't even need the blockchain anymore.)

[17:48:16] <Alipha> So, either you're someone who's downloading the whole blockchain, or you're someone who doesn't want to validate the whole blockchain and you're simply interfacing with someone who already has. With the latter, you could easily be fed bad data and you'd never know. With the former, the attack is that the person you're getting the "complete" blockchain from is not actually the complete blockchain. But in that
[17:48:18] <Alipha> scenario, if someone is trying to trick you in believing their "fake" chain is indeed the longest chain, then that'll be obvious it's not the case because the attacker would have to have signed more blocks than their allowed percentage or have invalid signatures. Or that chain would never grow over time. All indications that something is wrong
[17:54:27] <yanmaani> Alipha: No?
[17:54:44] <yanmaani> The attacker in this case can just totally create a fake chain

[20:45:43] <tusko> Suppose we have two large, distinct primes p and q and we multiply them.
[20:46:01] <Haohmaru> integer_overflow
[20:46:23] <tusko> like consider the multiplicative group F_pq^*
[20:46:57] <tusko> If we want Euler's totient function for that group modulo pq, that is
[20:48:12] <tusko> we have to count up all the factors of p: p, 2p, 3p, 4p, ..., (q-1)p, pq; and all the factors of q: q, 2q, 3q, 4q, ..., (p-1)q, pq
[20:48:57] <tusko> pq is repeated, so the order of the group is like (q-1)p(p-1)q?
[20:51:08] <tusko> Well, ofc, I know that if n=pq then phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1) but I am having trouble proving it to myself.

[21:18:08] <dude12312414> one way would be to use the CRT: there is an isomorphism between Z/(pq) and Z/(p) x Z/(q). Elements in Z/(pq) coprime to pq map to elements (a, 0) and (0, b), which are p + q in total. But (0, 0) is counted twice
[21:18:35] <dude12312414> so you get pq - (p + q - 1) = (p - 1)(q - 1)
[21:19:06] <dude12312414> sorry i mean elements of Z coprime to pq

[21:19:59] <tusko> Yes, this is what I was trying to do I think
[21:20:13] <dude12312414> but yeah the fact that phi is multiplicative should follow from the CRT
[21:20:39] <tusko> but I don't really know what an isomorphism is
[21:20:47] <tusko> that means one-to-one?
[21:21:33] <dude12312414> bijection that preserves the operation
[21:23:07] <dude12312414> you should be able to count them directly anyway i think... what you did looks right
[21:23:55] <dude12312414> 0, p, 2p, 3p, ..., (q-1)p and 0, q, 2q, 3q, ..., (p-1)q
[21:24:21] <dude12312414> that is q + p, but 0 is counted twice so you have p + q - 1 elements that are not coprime to pq
[21:27:30] <dude12312414> (so phi would be pq minus that)
