[04:32:53] <patchvonbraun[m]> Next week on "Discovery:  The Pulsar People of the Amazon"
[04:34:45] <patchvonbraun[m]> Just trying to elucidate that "filterbank" or "channelbank" has a slightly different, but related, meaning, compared to what other types of DSP folks might be used to.  A pulsar filter/channelbank nearly always includes  the complex-to-mag and low-pass/decimation.
[04:36:06] <patchvonbraun[m]> Your channels typically only need to run at a few kHz for the downstream incoherent de-dispersion and pulsar-folding algorithms to work...
[04:36:42] <patchvonbraun[m]> In FRBs, you're doing MOST of that, but without the folding, and you're basically "hunting" for pulses after doing many trial de-dispersions...
[04:41:59] *** Joins: metal_egg (~metal0egg@pool-72-94-145-43.phlapa.fios.verizon.net)
[04:44:15] <muaddib[m]> I think I understand. So the operations are the same, but the logical order is different?
[04:45:06] <patchvonbraun[m]> The only difference, really, between FRB hunting and pulsar hunting is that you don't do a synchronous "folding" operation.  You're not looking for repeating pulses, but *bright* singleton pulses.
[04:45:32] <patchvonbraun[m]> Of course for pulsar *monitoring*, you already know what the dispersion parameters are, so there's no "hunting for the right dispersion parameter".
[04:46:07] <patchvonbraun[m]> and you know the folding period as well

[04:47:47] *** Joins: ephemer0l (~ephemer0l@organizedmagnetism.com)
[04:50:11] <patchvonbraun[m]> The SNR of single pulsar pulses is usually painfully small, so you use synchronous folding at the pulsar period to "stack" the pulses, and cause the noise to decrease proportional to sqrt(NFOLDS).  If you get the pulsar period wrong in this operation, of course, you tend to cause it to smear and have a much worse SNR.  Because of things like spin-down and doppler, the pulse rate actually changes ever-so-slightly during an observation.
[04:50:11] <patchvonbraun[m]> Sometimes you need to account for that, sometimes you don't.
[04:51:07] <patchvonbraun[m]> The timing on pulsar receiver chains is usually tied to an Rb or better clock, so that the pulse overlays don't slip due to your local clock slipping.  Which means that things like over-runs are kinda fatal...
[04:52:39] <patchvonbraun[m]> ...there'll be a test at the end of the week :) :)
[05:12:50] <muaddib[m]> Well then I need to take a little more of your Office hour time. 
[05:12:50] <muaddib[m]> .
[05:12:51] <muaddib[m]> So does a ‚Äúbright ‚Äúsingle FRB pulse mean that it has better SNR than a Single pulsar, but since it isn‚Äôt periodic you can‚Äôt constructively increase the SNR?
[05:14:39] <patchvonbraun[m]> Indeed.  FRBs are single events.    Usually very dispersed being very far away.   Which is where the trial de-dispersion comes in.  Usually only one or two of the trial de-dispersions will produce a pulse event if there's one on the data.
[05:17:19] <muaddib[m]> Wow. Looks like I‚Äôm headed for at least a C. 
[05:17:19] <muaddib[m]> So with de-dispersion, where do you get your trial dispersions from? Is that computed from theoretical assumptions or is it based on historical information?
[05:19:37] <patchvonbraun[m]> Dispersion is proportional to distance, since the mechanism involves the EM waves travelling through the incredibly-thin inter-stellar medium, which is a very-close-to-vacuum plasma.   But if you're an EM wave travelling through a column of ISM that's 10s of thousands of lightyears deep, the high frequency components will arrive a little before the low-frequency components.  Soooo, you split the bandwidth into "chunks" and apply  a
[05:19:37] <patchvonbraun[m]> delay slope across those chunks.
[05:20:10] <patchvonbraun[m]> All the FRBs detected so far have been fairly far away--MOST of the extragalactic (at least, based on the dispersion).
[05:21:19] <patchvonbraun[m]> When you look at the energy implied by the pulse brightness, and the implied distances, the energies are stupendously huge.  Like the entire output of the Sun for a million years compressed into a millisecond...

[07:05:29] <patchvonbraun[m]> I just saw that we have LDPC stuff in the "Digital TV" part of GRC blocks :)
[07:07:41] <drmpeg> Yup. Much longer codes though. 16200 and 64800 bits.
[07:09:40] <patchvonbraun[m]> I haven't paid any attention to that stuff since around 1993.  Working for a company that did taxi-dispatch in-car terminals, operating over VHF voice channels.  
[07:10:59] <patchvonbraun[m]> I looked into implementing very lightweight FEC to reduce the amount of re-send traffic on the channel.  But it went way over their teensy little heads, and when I got an opportunity to leave that company and go back to Bell-Northern Resesarch, I did so :)
[07:12:25] <patchvonbraun[m]> The on-air protocol was based on BAUDOT, on the brain-dead theory that using BAUDOT would save bandwidth.  Except, you know, all that SI/SO traffic.  I did some actual measurements, and concluded that they'd save overall bandwidth by using 7-bit ASCII instead.  But, again, teensy little heads....
[07:15:40] <drmpeg> The LDPC story is cool. Invented in 1963 and forgotten because too much processing for computers of the time. Rediscovered in 1996.
[07:18:10] <patchvonbraun[m]> Hankins and Rickett invented the coherent de-dispersion algorithm in 1974.  It hasn't seen much use until relatively recently because it was computer-heavy...
