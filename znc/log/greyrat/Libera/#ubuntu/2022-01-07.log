I decided to try to upgrade the system (see if it needed it) and that's what led me here with what I'm describing when I came to the channel

[00:59:30] <sarnold> blahboybaz: that 'sudo apt autoremove

[00:59:48] <blahboybaz> I'll see
[01:01:13] <blahboybaz> Just that the problem occured where the upgrade happend all in one lump - ie: 2 packages out of a larger upgrade where the upgrade included both the problem packages and the ones that came in without any issue (in one upgrade)

[01:02:31] <sarnold> yeah :( and depending upon what broke, when, backing out of this problem can be a real pain if you don't know what to do
[01:02:48] <sarnold> I'm hoping the sudo apt autoremove just works, and then you can continue :)
[01:02:55] <blahboybaz> sarnold: It seems as if that worked.. I'll see how things play out as I used the computer here
[01:03:11] <sarnold> blahboybaz: good good ;) try sudo apt install -f   now
[01:03:16] <blahboybaz> it did some funny stuff (to me anyway) then it seemed to resolve everything
[01:03:17] <blahboybaz> thanks
[01:04:04] <blahboybaz> sarnold: Is there a way to check if anything is held or broken install before issuing a -f flag in a command?
[01:04:35] <blahboybaz> I'm no expert but it appears as if everything is fine (just want to be sure tho)
[01:05:00] <sarnold> blahboybaz: in this case, the -f flag means --fix-broken  -- it's far safer and happier to run than eg rm -f  :)
[01:05:10] <blahboybaz> oh
[01:05:14] <blahboybaz> right on
[01:05:48] <sarnold> I'm not actually sure if dpkg or apt knows what's broken at that moment or not .. I *think* dpkg -l   | grep -v ^rc | grep -v ^ii   would probably show you what's funny

[02:46:54] <Nobrem> matsaman, thank you - typing now!
[02:47:23] <Nobrem> So, I am producing some "time lapse" videos.  The term time lapse means, that the videos are being sped up massively.
[02:47:35] <Nobrem> I would like to show the time not as timestamp, but as relative time.
[02:47:37] <Nobrem> 1 minute
[02:47:40] <Nobrem> 2 minutes
[02:47:41] <Nobrem> and so on
[02:47:49] <Nobrem> after 59 minutes,  it should go to hourly
[02:47:50] <Nobrem> 1 hour
[02:47:52] <Nobrem> 2 hours
[02:48:03] <Nobrem> without displaying the minutes any longer
[02:48:13] *** Joins: EriC^ (~eric@178.135.1.181)
[02:48:26] <Nobrem> Currently, I am doing this all in "ffmpeg"  (which I love)
[02:48:50] <Nobrem> the benefit with "ffmpeg" is, that I can speed up the video whereever I want afterwards,  because the timestamp is in the video itself
[02:49:00] <neildugan> Nobrem, sounds like you need a script parsing 'uptime'
[02:49:38] <Nobrem> neildugan, thank you for your answer.  Is this something Davince Resolve can do?
[02:49:45] <matsaman> oh, I thought you were saying you use ffmpeg to add the timestamps themselves, which is probably what I would do
[02:49:50] <Nobrem> I am also open to using an open source alternative,  e.g.  shotcut or kdenlive
[02:50:07] <Nobrem> matsaman, yep, my bash script works for that in "ffmpeg"
[02:50:14] <Nobrem> but the videos are in 4K and 200 GB large
[02:50:21] <Nobrem> so, it takes a really long, long, long time doing so
[02:50:35] <matsaman> how are people consuming these videos?
[02:50:41] *** Quits: jje (~jje@user/jje) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:50:42] <Nobrem> the exported videos will only be very short..

[02:51:15] <Nobrem> matsaman, I take it you don't like such videos? ;)
[02:51:33] <matsaman> I like videos alright
[02:51:37] <Nobrem> My idea is,  if I only applied the times to the parts of the video which get really exported, it would save time
[02:51:52] <Nobrem> editing a 10-15 min video is less than adding time stamps to 2 hours video material
[02:52:59] <Nobrem> neildugan?
[02:53:27] <Nobrem> neildugan, you answered me before,  thank you for that,  but please clarify:  Is this something Davince Resolve can do?  (the script)
[02:53:59] <Nobrem> at the moment, my work flow seems to be so lengthy... taking a 200 GB video and producing an other 200 GB video just with timestamps in it
[02:54:26] <Nobrem> I should better import the 200 GB video into DaVinci Resolve (or shotcut or kdenlive) and only add the timestamps to the SHORT exported video

[03:01:07] <oerheks> that is a long standing issue, making a correct coder

[03:02:32] <oerheks> nope, i was just curious howfar they are

[03:03:11] *** Joins: sdfgsdfg (~sdfgsdfg@user/sdfgsdfg)
[03:03:24] <Nobrem> could I use "ffmpeg" to change the codec of said exported videos from Davinci Resolve, or would that lead to a loss of quality?
[03:03:29] *** Joins: marc_ (~marc@82.8.161.206)
[03:03:45] <Nobrem> because ffmpeg can definitely change codecs,  the question is only,  if that would be a bad idea to do so
[03:04:05] <marc_> Anyone know how to display the linkspeeds on graphics card and nvme drives
[03:04:46] <oerheks> any change is basicly loss of quality, it is not original anymore. question is do you notice it.
[03:05:55] <oerheks> marc_, on what ubuntu version?

[17:38:18] <ogra> mncheck, ubuntu imports from debian for a certain part of the release cycle ... eventually syncs stop and packages get stabilized and eventually released ... once released they do not get synced anymore (there are stable release updates for single backported bugfixes and such though)
