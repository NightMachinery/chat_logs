[00:01:30] <tomathy> what does that mean
[00:01:51] <biys> i have a couple computers in my basement that do stuff
[00:02:06] <_candle_> Well i think a one off like tomathy said when he was annoyed is different to ongoing sexual slurs and tomathy stopped after that one insult
[00:03:01] <biys> i see no problems with any level of text unless it makes the channel un-usable.
[00:03:09] <biys> like large amounts of scrolling
[00:03:28] <biys> there are certain network "rules" that are attempted to be applied
[00:03:52] <biys> i think those are silly as well
[00:04:05] <biys> but it's not my network so there's some levels i will go to remain here
[00:05:06] <biys> i grew up with things like the anarchist cookbook and TMB and yourward news though
[00:05:20] <biys> i'm not easily triggered by "hateful" content
[00:05:21] <_candle_> What is tmb
[00:05:28] <biys> the misanthropic bitch
[00:05:31] <apotheon> "tmb"?
[00:05:37] <apotheon> hmm
[00:05:48] <_candle_> I tend to agree with the network rules i guess
[00:06:04] <_candle_> What is it about biys
[00:06:12] <apotheon> biys: I'm curious about your upbringing and current sociopolitical views.
[00:06:14] <biys> lemme see if i can find her ont he wayback machine

[00:06:51] <biys> that is a decent summary
[00:07:06] <biys> if you want to see the content i can only suggest finding it y ourself
[00:07:16] <biys> as...  it would likely be considered problematic to post it here or on this network
[00:08:35] <biys> actually in my case, the more you tell me NOT to read something
[00:08:38] <biys> the more likely i am to read it
[00:08:42] <biys> specially if you tel me it's "bad"
[00:09:52] <_candle_> Somewhat contraversial
[00:10:01] <biys> whatever that means
[00:10:08] <biys> i also read Paul Treanor
[00:10:12] <apotheon> I've encountered TMB before, but hadn't really read her stuff.
[00:10:28] <evolv> I saw Sam Harris was brought up
[00:10:29] <apotheon> I just hadn't heard a word about her in twenty years.
[00:10:49] <biys> apotheon: now that you mention it i will likely spend the night finding all her content and mirroring it
[00:10:56] <apotheon> har
[00:10:57] <apotheon> good plan
[00:10:58] <biys> just cause it's literature that should never die
[00:11:02] <evolv> I fondly recall the Cuck Philosophy complete slam on his book
[00:11:06] <apotheon> probably true
[00:11:10] <evolv> I never liked Sam Harris
[00:11:30] <biys> i have no real problems with Sam Harris.  he's doing his thing and making money
[00:11:30] <apotheon> I've only read one book by Sam Harris: The End of Faith.
[00:11:33] <biys> i'm fine with it
[00:11:47] <apotheon> He made some interesting points.
[00:12:14] <_candle_> I don't agree with everything Sam Harris says but I thinl he seems a genuinely nice person trying to help people
[00:12:17] <evolv> he doesn't provide anything novel, insightful, and he comes across as smug
[00:12:32] <biys> woop!  here it is
[00:12:34] <biys> i'll post it

[00:13:08] <apotheon> Yeah, that's where I'd go first to find it.
[00:13:19] <biys> evolv: well him and JPB did a debate on essentially...  biological determinism vs. free will
[00:13:26] <biys> and it was a good 3 part debate if you're into that kind of stuff
[00:13:41] <apotheon> Was Sam Harris the "biological determinism" proponent?
[00:13:50] <biys> he was the free will part
[00:14:01] <apotheon> oh, interesting
[00:14:02] <biys> JBP thinks in regards to biological determinism a lot
[00:14:07] <biys> he references Jaque Panksepp
[00:14:07] <apotheon> weird
[00:14:10] <biys> "the rat tickler"
[00:14:15] <apotheon> given his pro-religion positions
[00:14:29] <_candle_> Seems like a troll/joke website
[00:14:45] <biys> _candle_: i could see some people thinking that
[00:15:06] <tomathy> that website seems controversial
[00:15:36] <evolv> biys, I'm interested in neither person
[00:15:36] <apotheon> That's the point.
[00:15:37] <biys> i should also mirror hack canada
[00:15:51] <biys> hack canada had so many ezines from my youth
[00:16:01] <biys> i need to keep all that stuff and read it to my kids
[00:16:08] <evolv> Peterson and Harris are biological determinists
[00:16:09] <apotheon> cool idea
[00:16:19] <evolv> so they debate was against an invisible adversary
[00:16:34] <evolv> Peterson doesn't have a coherent ideology
[00:16:45] <biys> well he dabbles with certain groups

[00:17:28] <apotheon> Politicians?
[00:17:32] <evolv> other than Peterson demonstrating white nationalist sentiments

[00:39:17] <biys> i always ask the question of what extent they were slaves in egypt
[00:39:25] <biys> are they slaves like i'm a slave to this system?
[00:39:44] <biys> perhaps some form of willing participant?  or was it a slave in the sense of whips and chains and shackels and such

[00:42:01] <ro-bot-o> [url] Trichinosis - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[00:42:53] <_candle_> I knew one Jewish man and  a seven day adventist family who kept Kosher and I have to hand it to them they looked like the most beautiful healthy people I ever saw.
[00:43:43] <_candle_> Could have been coincidental but well, I don't know
[00:43:56] <biys> is the idea glamorous to you or the people?
[00:44:04] <_candle_> Diet makea a big difference
[00:44:36] <_candle_> Just factually their skin was perfect and in perfect shape/health
[00:45:05] <apotheon> _candle_: Having to watch your diet like a hawk tends to result in better health.
[00:45:12] <apotheon> (all else being equal)
[00:45:13] <_candle_> Yes true

[00:45:57] <apotheon> As a result, paleo, veganism, carnivore diet, low-carb diet, and a bunch of other things can all result in better overall health, as long as you don't end up depriving yourself of something important.
[00:45:59] <tomathy> _candle_: i fasted once and my skin was the healthiest ive ever seen
[00:46:09] <tomathy> so it's probably fasting
[00:46:22] <biys> i didn't showr for a week
[00:46:24] <biys> once
[00:46:31] <biys> felt fine
[00:46:45] <tomathy> i didnt for a month and nearly combusted
[00:46:57] <apotheon> Fasting can also have a positive effect, depending on how you do it, but it doesn't have a continuous effect the way a particular diet does, unless you're doing some intermittent fasting.
[00:47:21] <tomathy> it only helps you if you dont mind dying doing it and really want to do it
[00:47:35] <tomathy> if you let the fear sneak in you will suffer and fail
[00:47:57] <tomathy> i hate intermittent
[00:48:01] <apotheon> I actually use daily intermittent fasting -- no calories for a sixteen hour period in a twenty-four hour day.
[00:48:09] <_candle_> I did a lot of fasting in the past and I looked very skinny and healthy
[00:48:27] <_candle_> And running an hour a day might have helped
[00:48:33] <apotheon> We cheat once in a while, but mostly stick to it like glue.
[00:48:53] <apotheon> Yeah, thirty minutes of cardio is *awesome* for your health.
[00:48:58] <audrey> I eat two small meals a day, works for me
[00:49:07] <audrey> I can't even eat much anymore without feeling massive bloat.
[00:49:11] <audrey> Mind feels a lot clearer.
[00:49:25] <audrey> Wonder sometimes whether overeating is unnatural.
[00:49:27] <_candle_> Hmm i should start running again or moubtain climbing. I used to climb this mountain every day for a few years.
[00:49:27] <apotheon> You probably watch *what* you eat more than most people as a result, too.
[00:49:46] <apotheon> I need more cardio in my life.
[00:49:48] <biys> if it fits in my mouth i'll eat it
[00:49:48] <Ungwelian> apotheon, doesn't that just take you into starvation mode?
[00:50:01] <apotheon> Ungwelian: "starvation mode" is a terrible term for it
[00:50:07] <apotheon> I take it you mean ketosis.
[00:50:22] <audrey> Got my BMI down to about 18. Looking lean and can fit into size 6 pretty easy.
[00:50:33] <Ungwelian> No, I mean starvation mode, after which your body looks to store energy.
[00:50:34] <audrey> Though I should probably be doing more cardio and weight training.
[00:50:35] <_candle_> How did you do it audrey
[00:50:42] <Ungwelian> Ketosis is great though.
[00:50:45] <audrey> Don't want to build too much muscle.
[00:51:05] <audrey> _candle_, combination of naturally low appetite and fast metabolism, mostly
[00:52:14] <biys> girl baby used to attack the books on the shelf,  they were just barely in her reach.  as an experiment i put all the books on the lowest shelf and gave her full access.  for the first day she was very interested in them.  so i'd sit with her and we'd read them all as she pulled them off the shelf.  now she's less interested and only brings me a few books a day
[00:52:15] <apotheon> I just realized that getting up late threw off my whole schedule today.
[00:52:19] <biys> at least they aren't all ont he floor anymore!
[00:52:48] <apotheon> It's time for me to get some writing done.

[00:53:33] <tomathy> i know a great back to running routine if anyone needs it
[00:53:42] <tomathy> you have to be fat though
[00:53:43] <audrey> Another advantage to lower weight: you can do pull-ups more easily
[00:53:50] <_candle_> What is it tomathy
[00:54:08] <audrey> Now, if only I could figure out how to stop my cheekbones from poking out like a skeleton, and get rid of these dark circles under my eyes.

[00:55:02] <_candle_> I do sometimes
[00:55:06] <audrey> My mom is convinced I have some kind of vitamin deficiency due to my being a vegetarian since age ~16
[00:55:21] <audrey> She's also the woman who lived on nothing but potatoes and carrots for the first twenty winters of her life, so
[00:55:32] <audrey> kind of confused why she of all people would worry about vitamins

[00:55:54] <_candle_> How does she look eating only carrots and potatos
[00:56:05] <audrey> _candle_, well this was decades ago
[00:56:09] <_candle_> I must start juicing carrots again
[00:56:37] <audrey> In rural USSR where you didn't have anything else to eat, except maybe an occasional kielbasa
[00:56:47] <audrey> Things were better in the summer but the winters were always austere
[00:57:51] <_candle_> When i was running every day I was down to like 47kg, maybe I was heading for anorexia then but actually i think i was extremely healthy. I have to find the time again
[00:58:12] <audrey> I don't actually know if vitamin supplements are effective or not.
[00:58:19] <audrey> Main thing I have to worry about is osteoporosis.
[00:58:24] <_candle_> I think they are helpful
[00:58:27] <tomathy> dont let the fatties tell you you're too skinny
[00:58:47] <_candle_> Take calcuim and vitamin d to try to prevent osteo
[00:58:53] <_candle_> And maybe K too i think
[00:58:58] <audrey> Lol. My friend accused me of being an anorexic once or twice. I don't see it.
[00:59:54] <_candle_> Tomorrow morning I might go climb that mountain again
[01:00:43] <_candle_> I put on weight since covid
[01:03:57] <apotheon> For avoiding osteoporosis, there's rarely an actual deficiency in calcium intake; it's usually just not being managed well.
[01:04:00] <Ungwelian> BMI 18 is at the lowest boundary of normal.

[01:04:50] <audrey> "Listen, fat..."
[01:04:54] <apotheon> Vegans sometimes have a harder time getting calcium, though.
[01:05:49] <apotheon> audrey: Dark circles under your eyes and bones showing through are probably the reason someone thinks you're anorexic.
[01:05:50] <_candle_> I got out my juicer and put it in the dishwasher...today i get lota of carrots. So good for your skin
[01:06:07] <_candle_> And low cost
[01:07:26] <_candle_> I worked at a juice bar and a lady got a large carrot juice every day, she pretty much turned orange.
[01:07:48] <apotheon> . . . and I'm off again, this time for a walk

[03:34:07] <biys> _candle_: my position is that i don't want my chats moderated by anyone other than myself.
[03:34:13] <biys> i don't want books burned on my behalf
[03:34:27] <biys> i don't want to see a time and place where peopel aren't allowed to address me however they see fit
[03:38:34] <_candle_> I agree really
[03:39:03] <biys> essentially what it is is telling someone how they SHOULD speak
[03:39:46] <biys> which for a whole slew of reasons seems problematic to me
[03:40:00] <_candle_> As as it is a 2 way street
[03:40:32] <biys> well no, lets say that a particular group of people is marginalized to some extent
[03:40:38] <biys> and they don't uphold the social mores you do
[03:40:48] <biys> does that mean they shouldn't be allowed to partake of the conversation?
[03:40:56] <biys> because they don't "speak how you think they should speak" ?
[03:42:14] <biys> it's essentially like saying: "i'm sorry, but you don't have the ability to carry on this conversation"
[03:45:25] <biys> i commaned you!
[03:45:28] <biys> think like i think
[03:45:30] <biys> talk like i talk
[03:45:30] <apotheon> On the other hand, there's something to be said for people being able to associate with people with whom they want to associate without being shouted down.
[03:45:32] <_candle_> I agree with you
[03:45:37] <apotheon> If you want different norms, make a different community.
[03:45:51] *** Joins: ua_ (~ua@public-gprs230015.centertel.pl)
[03:46:15] <apotheon> As long as the opportunity to make a different community is reasonably available, "problem solved".
[03:46:34] <biys> interesting
[03:46:41] <biys> would you allow a group of racists to espouse racists ideas then?
[03:47:35] <apotheon> How is it within my power to stop them if they're in a different community?
[03:47:41] <_candle_> No i think as tomathy did he said a sexual slur obviously arryana didnt like it so he then stopped i think that is good enough
[03:47:45] *** Quits: lakitu (~lakitu@192-198-3-9.dhcp.radiolinkinternet.com) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[03:48:59] <_candle_> Maybe he  ould
[03:49:05] <_candle_> Could appologise
[03:49:30] <apotheon> I might kick someone out of a community venue I control, and say "Hey, this one's mine.  You go be racist somewhere that's yours."
[03:50:10] <_candle_> Hopefully we can erradicate racism where evet it lives
[03:50:21] <apotheon> That'd be nice.
[03:50:23] <_candle_> Ever*
[03:50:31] <apotheon> It can't be eradicated by making rules against it, though.
[03:50:41] <apotheon> People need to change their thinking.
[03:50:55] *** Joins: lakitu (~lakitu@192-198-3-9.dhcp.radiolinkinternet.com)
[03:50:56] <apotheon> Making a rule doesn't change thoughts.
[03:51:01] <biys> well idk.  i don't necessarily see a problem with an in group preference.  there's other laws to combat things like violence and harassment
[03:51:22] <apotheon> Yeah, harassment is a separate matter.
[03:53:25] <_candle_> Yes if tomathy kept saying it about arryana when she didn't like it then it would be harrassment
[03:53:32] <audrey> Well, the view ex cathedra here is: if you don't like the moderation in ##philosophy you are welcome to move elsewhere
[03:53:47] <_candle_> I like the moderation here
[03:54:37] <biys> it isn't so much about the moderation of the channel that the discussion is about
[03:54:45] <biys> imo anyways
[03:55:13] <audrey> Sure, just making a point about "free association"
[03:55:16] <audrey> Which I am also a fan of.
[03:57:38] <_candle_> In the rules of Libera it says no defamation I agree with that.
[04:00:08] <apotheon> audrey: Yeah, that was the basic point I made a little bit ago.
[04:01:12] <apotheon> _candle_: My level of agreement with that depends on your definition of "defamation", I suppose.
[04:03:35] <_candle_> https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/defamation
[04:03:35] <ro-bot-o> [url] Defamation | Definition of Defamation by Merriam-Webster | www.merriam-webster.com
[04:04:22] <_candle_> Anyway gtg do something
[04:16:06] <_candle_> What if someone was defaming you on a public website biys ...or what if arryana was told she should just put up with it..pk free speech?
[04:19:01] <_candle_> I think there are lines and i agree with the rules against that sort of thing
[04:40:02] <_candle_> I agree with free association also but yes id that group is getting to together to be racist to someone not associating with them then that is not good
[04:43:14] <_candle_> Publishing false statements about them etc

[05:15:19] <_candle_> or sexist or whatever reason
[05:16:26] <biys> i think the thing about it is, first off it's a matter of perception.  we're expecting all peopel to have the same perceptions and the same understandings of the world
[05:16:44] <biys> secondly
[05:17:12] <biys> it seems weird that there's almost some kind of compelled mandate that we accept diversity of thought and idea and concept
[05:17:15] <biys> YET
[05:17:28] <biys> we don't want to mandate the acceptable of all thought/idea/concept
[05:17:45] <biys> :s/acceptable/acceptance/
[05:18:30] <biys> and which ideas/thoughts/concepts we find acceptable or not don't seem to be determined as a result of any kind of plebiscite
[05:19:07] <biys> democracy is inherently problematic for minority groups
[05:19:41] <biys> so it, imo, comes down to the idea of the origin of these beliefs of what is the most admirable way to live within the world
[05:19:54] <biys> and the question is if they'll transcend space and time
[05:20:46] <biys> the question is also if they'er organic in nature
[05:24:16] <biys> apotheon: do you th ink that an in-group preference is a matter of nature or nurture?
[05:24:46] <biys> could there be some kind of biological function associated with the determination of who we can trust or can't?
[05:24:56] <biys> i hear people talk about their "gut" feeling all the time
[05:24:58] <biys> whatever that means
[05:25:16] <audrey> It's probably all gas
[05:25:20] <biys> HAH
[05:25:31] <biys> i wouldn't doubt it tbh
[05:26:39] <biys> i tend to have more in common with people who've had the same experiences i have
[05:28:33] <audrey> Nobody's had the same experiences I've had; does this explain why I'm growing old alone and bitter? LOL!
[05:28:56] <biys> i bet we'd have more in common than you'd think, but it is unlikely i'd be willing to talk about any significant matter of my personal life on irc
[05:28:59] <biys> much less in general
[05:29:32] <audrey> Smart. I'm pretty tight-lipped about most of my personal life. At least the stuff that really matters.
[05:29:53] <biys> you heard the song by juice wrld "wishing well"
[05:30:02] <audrey> No, but I can look it up.

[05:30:39] <biys> btw
[05:31:55] <biys> this all kind of falls into what wolfgang streek says about the collapse of capitalism though
[05:32:03] <biys> in the superficiality/materialistic aspect
[05:32:10] <biys> associated with the sustainable development ideas
[05:32:19] <audrey> I'm waiting for the collapse of agriculture.
[05:32:35] <audrey> Time to hoard the drum tanks full of water, the guns, the shelves of vitamins, the ammo and the tactical nuclear weapons.
[05:32:43] <biys> you really think?
[05:32:53] <audrey> It turns out there are few problems a 10,000 ton artillery shell won't solve.
[05:33:08] <biys> SWIM works for one of the largest food distributors, if not the largest
[05:33:12] <biys> i've heard nothing about anything like that
[05:33:33] <biys> even though there's supply chain issues ATM
[05:33:35] <audrey> I'm being facetious here, but not completely
[05:33:43] <biys> there's not any major signifiacnt shortages that i'm aware of
[05:34:18] <audrey> Actually, we might be talking past each other here.
[05:34:50] <audrey> I thought for a moment you were alluding to financial/economic collapse?
[05:35:00] <audrey> Or is this more of a "moral collapse" of the kind that conservative intellectuals have been warning about
[05:35:13] <audrey> (and which, if true, might have already occurred)
[05:38:24] <audrey> Actually, never mind. I may have been reading too much into this conversation.
[05:39:07] <biys> there's probably a lot of context that's missing from this on my part
[05:39:39] <biys> and the collapse is the idea of moving from a post-consumerism driven world to whatever is coming next
[05:44:15] <arcturus> or even a zombie apocalypse

[15:41:34] <pussipupu> Pleasant visit thus far?
[15:41:38] <arryana> they got perfect weather
[15:41:39] <arryana> oh hell yeah
[15:41:54] <arryana> they arrived as the roast chicken came out f the oven
[15:42:10] <arryana> so it was beer and roast chicken plus all things.

[15:43:21] <arryana> can't ask for more peaceful and happy than that
[15:43:38] <arryana> this morning we all had breakfast out there, and i showed them to the train station.
[15:44:18] <arryana> this evening will be a screening of 28 days later in the zen room.
[15:44:48] <pussipupu> I can beat you on one front, we had two real fires last night :p

[15:44:59] <pussipupu> Good film, and so is the sequel
[15:45:09] <arryana> yeah, we'll do that the night after.
[15:45:28] <arryana> when the summerhouse goes in, that'll have a real fire.
[15:46:04] <arryana> it's bonfire night soon
[15:46:33] <arryana> we've got a little metal fire pit dealie for that sort of thing
