[00:10:54] <Shortstop> other than that, set it up with nice art programs, browser, etc, it was great
[00:10:54] <Catie> I'm planning on switching my workplace over to Manjaro gradually as I can get them to switch from Windows
[00:11:10] <krux02> Shortstop, don't mention the Thinkpad x230, I had a Thinkpad x220-Tablet until two weeks ago, where the tea incident happened.
[00:11:24] <TRS-80> krux02: Computer for most people nowdays is what, 90% (more?) just browser anyway?  Which can totally be done on Linux.  My experience is similar to yours in installing GNU/Linux for friends/family.
[00:11:30] <Shortstop> Not a fan of Arch fanboys, but Manjaro's good for a just works setup honestly. I'm using Fedora these days but definitely have my eyes for switching to like 5 different things, we'll flip a coin lol
[00:11:54] <Shortstop> krux02 best damn computer I've bought in a while
[00:12:01] <Shortstop> I personally have the regular version, but yeah, more than impressed
[00:12:17] <krux02> I have manjaro as well, here right now on this computer. I could not endure a fresh Arch install again.
[00:12:23] <Catie> I was using Fedora at work up until pretty recently, it just started getting on my nerves
[00:12:31] * neeasade hugs his NixOS install
[00:12:33] <krux02> but generally I prefer Arch over Majaro after the installation
[00:12:36] <TRS-80> Catie: Good luck with that, bur I think you will be in for uphill battle!
[00:12:45] <krux02> well NixOS is not for the end user
[00:12:56] <Catie> They're all uphill battles! But I'm tenacious and a little mean, so I think it'll work eventually
[00:13:03] <krux02> it is a system from developers for developers who want to have reprducable everything
[00:13:12] <Shortstop> Yeah I hated Fedora for the default partitioning scheme it uses
[00:13:23] <Shortstop> 'lvm'
[00:13:55] <Shortstop> so annoying to have to literally re-add space every time. I know you can partition it yourself, but still annoying since you only have the option to do terminal partitioning
[00:14:24] <Shortstop> I was using Gentoo up until this computer, and honestly I got sick of kernel config changes, etc.
[00:14:38] <krux02> Shortstop, yes I agree on XFCE for "mom". It is boring, doesn't change, isn't creative
[00:14:41] <Shortstop> I'm one of those people who like minimal desktops though (Openbox + Tint2, etc). I'm using 'exwm' on this laptop right now
[00:14:53] <Shortstop> looked frigging tight, and comparable to Windows to me

[00:17:37] <neeasade> I was there when wal was announced
[00:17:39] <krux02> neeasade, exwm has an option to replace the current window manager, so it is easy to try it out. But I won't recommend that thing for everyday usage, it tends to be a bit more wonky when started that way.

[00:40:37] <TRS-80> umaxtu: I think accountants make it overly complex, I find the text based accounting simplification (to + and -) to be easier to comprehend than complex system of debits and credits
[00:41:28] <artefact> dr and cr are easy once you think of them just as accounting terms. not real life debit and credit in the usual sense
[00:42:02] <acdw> oh is that what arbitrage is?!
[00:42:06] <TRS-80> well that's because debit and credit are from the bank perspective, but have entered common usage and thus muddied the waters
[00:42:29] <artefact> on bank statements yes. if you do personal accounting, no

[00:54:54] <rpav> i should use org-zen; i'll keep an empty org-mode buffer, and occasionally switch to it and check off any listed items i've completed

[00:55:38] <neeasade> I also have panel stuff/in my face what I want to do from there
[00:55:39] <TRS-80> acdw: I tried that way (importing) at first, but did not like how everything was ALL IN CAPS, and descriptions were not always accurate, so I just decided to do it manually, but with some ELisp based helpers like completing-read vendor list for instance, to smooth the process.  It works well for me.  Next I think I add a hook for smart categorization.
[00:55:57] <neeasade> additionally making sure that I'm always clocked into a headline -- so I can see where my time went eventually

[04:15:23] <johnjay> now that i think about it. is there even a function in package.el to search for function names in melpa packages?
[04:15:25] <s-liao> It is not built-in
[04:15:31] <johnjay> sort of an analogue to apt-file?
[04:16:10] <treed> With ement+embark I can just "C-. h" on a function name in chat to get the info about a function, heh
[04:16:15] <twb> johnjay: that would require melpa to not suck
[04:16:23] <johnjay> i see
[04:16:54] <treed> Knowing what functions a package actually provides requires running it
[04:16:58] <treed> Due to the nature of elisp
[04:17:25] <treed> You could just take defuns I guess, but there are so many possibilities for indirection it wouldn't be that reliable.
[04:19:08] <johnjay> how does common lisp or scheme do it
[04:19:11] <johnjay> same problem?

[04:19:56] *** Quits: keyehzh (~keyehzh@user/keyehzh) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:20:15] <johnjay> ah ok. so only way would be to have some kind of external standard
[04:20:22] <johnjay> like defcustom or something in elisp
[04:20:27] <treed> There are a lot of ways to define functions. defun, cl-defun, cl-defstruct all come to mind immediately
[04:20:27] <johnjay> to mark what the package does or doesn't provide
[04:20:30] <treed> Yeah

[04:20:43] <treed> Any language with extensive macros is gonna have this problem

[04:21:01] <mfiano> err what?
[04:21:11] <johnjay> when i was fiddling with quicklisp
[04:21:15] <treed> Apparently there's a ts-defstruct which is a warpper around cl-defstruct
[04:21:20] <johnjay> i didn't know the name of the function to run the thing
[04:21:25] <johnjay> like (somepackage:somefunc)
[04:21:27] <mfiano> Quicklisp is for systems, not packages.
[04:21:31] <johnjay> there was a command to look it up
[04:21:35] <treed> Only way I could think of to do this automatically would be to execute the code and then dump the symbol table
[04:22:05] <treed> And even there you might have like conditionally defined functions or whatever

In this ivy, counsel, swiper setup tutorial https://writequit.org/denver-emacs/presentations/2017-04-11-ivy.html they say first to install counsel and that it will bring in ivy and swiper as dependencies. but I also use use-package and indeed the tutorial provide an use-package example loading ivy.. already here I wonder.. aha.. should I load them both? do I need to load swipe also? The tutorial dont 
[05:25:15] <jirido> menion it. Also different ...
[05:25:18] <jirido> ... configurartions are sugested but not put in to the structure user-package provide. It is all a bit confusing. Does anyone here use them all together and could share the settings or explain?

[05:28:05] <johnjay> i checked by trying to turn on ivy-mode first
[05:34:14] <jirido> okej. So no need to install it I supose then, but use-package also provide a convenient structure for related settings and loading of modes etc. That is why I wory if I anyway should put the ivy package in its own load entryand how to set its configurations(provided in the tutorial out of that contect) in it, but as you don't use use-package you would not know.

[06:44:57] <lockywolf> Is it possible to placate semantic's parsers with a stronger cpu?
[06:45:38] <lockywolf> For example, for Emacs Lisp it takes ages for semantic to parse all the file tree.

[09:27:51] <wgreenhouse> that's dumb and it shouldn't, threads or no.
[09:28:08] <wgreenhouse> that's just a bad design
[09:28:21] <lockywolf> emacs-batch is not bad
[09:28:21] <pingpongball> Hello my sweet blueberries
[09:29:02] <wgreenhouse> lockywolf: no, indeed, relying on emacs --batch for network fetches would be sane.
[09:29:15] <wgreenhouse> what's it blocking on if not that?
[09:29:22] <lockywolf> ahh..
[09:29:25] <lockywolf> on parsing rss
[09:29:45] <lockywolf> it does not actually block on network, I think
[09:29:57] <lockywolf> it's just curl run in async processes
[09:30:17] <lockywolf> but after it has fetched the feeds, it needs to parse them and update the UI
[09:30:49] <lockywolf> I think that Semantic could be offloaded to a separate Emacs process too.

[09:35:52] <wgreenhouse> semantic seems harder because it's tightly coupled to editing (i.e. deciding what TAB or M-. does in a particular spot), so the critical phase is always going to be right in your way. but yeah, that should probably be on some kind of client-server model the way the various lsp modes are.

[12:50:43] <divlamir[m]> well, if you use doom just clone the repo back in ~/.emacs.d
[12:50:59] <Hash> what do you mean?
[12:51:13] <Hash> i installed doom emacs over it

[12:53:53] <Hash> I don't know what else I might have to config, but doing a backup asap.
[12:55:46] <divlamir[m]> `.emacs.d` follows the git repo so you don't really need a backup of it, just your custom config in `doom.d`

[13:37:16] <terzievk> sry
[13:39:27] <thblt> Idk about English, but French printer slang is surprisingly precise in describing typographic errors.  You don't use the same word for using a character instead of another (coquille), forgetting one or more characters (bourdon) or misplacing a character or a series of characters (mastic). 
[13:40:09] <thblt> Although it's probably from the lead-type era where those called for different solutions, the only word still in wide use afaik is coquille, which carries the three meanings.

[13:42:06] <taeaad> Spelling, omission, translocation. I would think.
[13:42:08] <s-liao> taeaad, the variable eww-download-directory is dynamically bound, what you need is lexical-binding variable.
[13:42:25] <thblt> empwilli: Indeed! In French we use widows and orphans, like English.
[13:42:43] <taeaad> s-liao: Eh. Lexical as in a shortcut?

[13:48:43] <thblt> empwilli: emacs variables can be global, or local to a bunch of things, including buffers, files, directories…

[13:50:09] <thblt> empwilli: yes, roughly.  
[13:50:35] <empwilli> setq will set the variable globally, right? or does it only set the currently valid instance?
[13:51:17] <thblt> It depends.  If the variable is marked as buffer-local, setq will set it on the current buffer.
[13:51:48] <empwilli> ok; any way to make a variable buffer-local from elisp, or to set the global variable then?

[18:00:54] <EdwardIII> lockywolf: i think they're taken straight from the IRC protocol, but i couldn't find a nice table. you can search for them in the ERC source to get a clue though
[18:01:00] <lockywolf> every sequence ending with C-g is undefined
[18:01:14] <nicode> Oh, I see, good trick lockywolf :)
[18:01:23] <lockywolf> it's more than a trick :)
[18:01:57] <nicode> What, do you mena that you can't end a sequence in C-g (ever)?
[18:02:01] <nicode> mean*
[18:02:10] <lockywolf> C-g is a little special, in the sense that not just is every sequence ending with C-g undefined, but there are some hooks in C code that let you interrupt some C functions
[18:02:21] <nicode> I see
[18:02:36] <nicode> So it's not an emacs thing, it's a C thing, right?

[18:03:04] <lockywolf> there are two Emacsen under the hood

[18:03:31] <lockywolf> but the C-emacs and the Lisp-emacs are the two that you are the most likely to ever encounter
[18:03:44] <krux02> lockywolf, doom emacs automatically sets next-error-function to flycheck-next-error-function
[18:04:02] <lockywolf> I don't use doom, but I have the same issue.

[18:04:55] <krux02> lockywolf, setting it to nil (default value) restores old behavior

[18:06:42] <lockywolf> oh, you mean, C-c ! n ?

[18:07:02] <krux02> it is a horrible key binding
[18:07:14] <krux02> but it still exists
[18:07:28] <lockywolf> yeah...
[18:07:44] <krux02> you can also define you own function that looks if flycheck has anything to offer and if not falls back to the old behavior (somehow that should be possible)

[18:27:57] <Nistar> Hello there. Somewhat new to Emacs - trying to figure out using it for C dev. I'd like the ability to introspect external refernces like typedefs, functions, variables, etc. I've come across GGTAGS, but that just seems to (by default at least?) work on a local project -- it doesn't look like it's able to drill down into the standard system library, without creating GGTAGS indexing files there?
[18:27:59] <Nistar> (Seems completely unnecessary to have GGTAGS metadata in my standard system library path)
[18:28:06] <lockywolf> also user lists are not nice at ll
[18:28:33] <johnjay> Nistar: the only ways i know of are tags and lsp
[18:28:39] <johnjay> lsp is the more modern way. try package-install lsp-mode
[18:28:42] <lockywolf> Nistar, ggtags is the "old way".
[18:29:18] <lockywolf> In the old times you would have ggtags in the local project, and idutils to squeeze IDs systemwide
[18:29:35] <Nistar> Ok, thank you. GGTAGS, along with Helm?
[18:29:38] <johnjay> does ggtags not integrate with ivy?
[18:29:45] <lockywolf> but nowadays you most probably want either irony, or cmake-ide

[18:38:44] <krux02> libfud, I think emacs is mostly valuable, because it is a lisp machine, a working environment. Not a text editor. And by default it is overloaded with feauters that nobody needs and are basically unusable because of archaic keyboard shortcuts. But yea, it can be used as a text editor.
[18:38:49] <xheimlich> we live in a rental apartment in the thick of what passes for big city. it's the lifestyle we'd chosen before kids.

[18:39:55] <johnjay> ok that's a new one
[18:40:08] <krux02> but I really dislike latex for many reasons. It makes good papers, but in the end we all end up reading on our screens

[18:40:16] <libfud> I use it all the time, it's super handy to be able to execute arbitrary code while I'm writing stuff
[18:40:43] <xheimlich> but I mean.

[18:41:35] <Nistar> Pandoc greatly simplifies dealing with LaTeX. You can write your thing in org-mode or whatever dialect, and it will be rendered into LaTeX. There are also ways to embed LaTeX within org-mode.
[18:41:38] <xheimlich> we know the kid´ s going to need his own room one day. maybe when he's 12, but some day.
[18:41:39] <krux02> libfud, true and it does a good job at it.

[18:42:20] <lockywolf> libfud, how exactly?
[18:42:20] <libfud> but frankly that's a minor quibble
[18:42:23] <xheimlich> these few days he's been annoying to get to nap during the day. but he's having one of them spurts. starting to miss one of us when I or her leave the house.
[18:42:32] <lockywolf> I actually published a paper written in org
[18:42:36] <libfud> lockywolf: I mean, it's better than the html that's generated by something like dreamweaver
[18:42:37] <krux02> lockywolf, I only print anything if somebody explicitly asks me do hand something in as a paper document.
[18:42:47] <Nistar> I very rarely deal with LaTeX directly outside of pandoc. The occasional formula, table, etc, but otherwise I just write away.
[18:42:59] <krux02> Not that I don't like reading on Paper. I actually enjoy it. But I just don't do it anymore.
[18:43:09] <xheimlich> and damn if having more space of his own (his crib is on our bedroom, but he still sleeps in the horizontal-position stroller during the day) wouldn't help a little.
[18:43:21] <lockywolf> I found that I do not understand stuff written on screen
[18:43:29] <libfud> I didn't have a printer for a long time
[18:43:46] <xheimlich> kid goes euphoric on the crib if he's not sound asleep before. He´ s really great, sleeps in the office with us, yadda yadda. But I keep wondering about the future.
[18:43:55] <lockywolf> So I am usually reading a paper document, while having a pdf open at the same time at a laptop nearby, for search.
[18:44:04] <libfud> but now that I'm building furniture for myself, I like to have printouts of my plans so I can reference the paper without having to use my phone or laptop in my garage while it's full of sawdust and I'm wearing gloves
[18:44:05] <Nistar> E-Ink ebook readers are nice when you have to read a lot of text and don't feel like printing it :-) You can root them and throw something like KOReader on there.

[18:44:34] <krux02> Nistar, I wrote master and bachelor thesis in Latex. These documents are usually filled with drawings, graphs, results, formulats. You just have to use raw latex here.
[18:44:35] <Nistar> KOReader is the reason I got my current e-ink reader ! :-)
[18:44:46] <krux02> I tried org-mode, but it limits yourself
[18:44:49] <lockywolf> do everything easily, and you can still dig into gory latex when required
[18:45:14] <libfud> krux02: I wonder if you could take a mixed approach
[18:45:15] <lockywolf> krux02, it does, but I found that I can do 95% of what I need with it
[18:45:18] <krux02> how is the build process with that?
[18:45:26] <lockywolf> and you can insert #+latex: lines
[18:45:26] <xheimlich> I wrote bachelor thesis in 2006 in latex somehow. maybe some mac app.

[18:46:42] <krux02> also no scientific paper is complete without related work.

[18:47:45] <Nistar> So, lots of texts, quotes, references, the occasional embedded picture, but yeah, I haven't done anything seriously science yet. Not opposed to it, just not there yet in my journey.
[18:47:56] <lockywolf> nope, you have to prove that you are not repeating other people
[18:48:00] <xheimlich> tex macros are so very useful.

[18:49:16] <Nistar> johnjay: Yes.
[18:49:24] <krux02> Especially because I like to referece work from the real world. Software that actually accomplishes a task. But that isn't scientific and therefore isn't considered as a scientific reference.
[18:49:31] <lockywolf> that is a nice side-effect
[18:49:36] <johnjay> it's kind of implicit in the science method i would argue
[18:49:51] <johnjay> because people need to be able to understand from the beginning how your conclusion is built up
[18:50:06] <xheimlich> krux02: there are books like "Scientific computing in Matlab/Maple/etc". I cited one of those.
[18:50:21] <xheimlich> like "Matlab [DWA 2015] exists."

[18:55:39] <Nistar> I think it's also the case that when we learn about science (especially as children), the narrative focuses on very exceptional scientists and very exceptional stories that may or may not be true about them; but the reality is that most researchers at most periods of time aren't trying to completely revolutionize science.

[19:00:58] <krux02> If you actually try to achieve something, science isn't the place to do it.
[19:00:59] <Nistar> krux02: Yeah. It's interesting too how much political power the revolutionizers have, and how much influence they actually have on science history. Newton for example was _really_ throwing his weight around in the Royal Society, one of the most prestiguous scientific institutions in Europe at the time, pretty much demanding by force everyone recognize him as a genius/exceptional/this/that/other.
[19:01:00] <Nistar> This is also at a time when there was already a _general_ trend of scientists discovering gravitation, calculus (Leibniz and others), etc. Raises questions indeed about the Kuhnian model of scientific revolutions.

[22:13:50] <thblt> cmburn: what's the use case?
[22:13:55] <TRS-80> when you invoke the mode, it should set it, no?
[22:14:50] <cmburn> it generally works if I just set the temp buffer to the mode, but for example with C-mode i have a bunch of hooks for LSP and cmake and stuff which get real unhappy, so i'm trying to just adopt the major mode comment-style without invoking the mode itself

[22:16:03] <thblt> More generally, borrowing comment-start and comment-end, as bpalmer suggested, could be enough.
[22:16:14] <thblt> If it isnt't, you'd better start the mode anyway.

[23:05:00] <acdw> johnjay what? no i'm just bad at typing sometimes
[23:05:03] <thblt> edgimar: ha, because cl-flet is a hack.  A let should work.
[23:05:37] <TRS-80> I was going to say "sorry I'm not familar with cl-flet" but now I feel a little better, thanks thblt :)
[23:05:39] <thblt> So you could just let a lambda, it should work.
[23:05:59] <thblt> Try pp-macroexpand this (cl-flet ((hello (s) (message "Hello, %s!" s))) (hello "world")) to understand what it does.
[23:06:07] <Catie> Good to know that it doesn't work the way I would expect it to in Common Lisp

[23:07:09] <thblt> If you cl-flet f as a function, it expands to a let and look in its body for lists whose car is f and replaces them with (funcall f)

[23:52:23] <thblt> kiraslaugh: anyhing else in *Messages* maybe?
[23:53:01] <edgimar> thblt: I think that's not true -- calling yas-insert-by-name should (and did on previous versions of emacs) provide a selection list.  Unless the behavior of yas-insert-snippet has changed, I thought that it used to insert by *key*, whereas this function should allow inserting by *name*.
[23:53:43] <kiraslaugh> Oh yes, it says require package `xelb-0.18 is unavailable

[23:57:57] <edgimar> thblt: hmmm.. maybe it is working after fixing the function list.  I think I was trying an invalid snippet name.. heh.

[23:59:54] <thblt> It behaves exactly like yas-insert-snippet, though, with worse completion.
