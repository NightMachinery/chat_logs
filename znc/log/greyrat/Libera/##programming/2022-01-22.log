[00:07:55] <user51> it's really nice if you know what change you need to do, but it's also easy to get lost
[00:08:06] <flakland> vim does some weird stuff on occasion
[00:08:15] <user51> i tried using sam as well, but didn't like it
[00:08:41] <GeDaMo> I learned 10 or so vi commands back in the 80s and haven't bothered to learn any more since :P
[00:08:52] <flakland> with recovery files
[00:09:31] <mawk> learning emacs shortcut is more useful
[00:09:35] <mawk> because you can use them in anything that uses readlone

[00:10:12] <vysn> I use vim and Emacs with evil mode (vim bindings)
[00:11:09] <user51> weird in the sense that what you need to do it doesn't quite map to what you'd guess
[00:11:21] <pyzozord> pulse: because vim has gazilion features
[00:11:24] <vysn> a distribution called Doom Emacs, its not bad, kind of best of both worlds

[00:12:02] <user51> my vimrc is mostly filled with key maps for common stuff, and abbrs for common strings
[00:12:31] <pulse> pyzozord, you can always just focus on a subset, though
[00:12:48] <epony> here is a cool idea: marcros in your configuration language ;-)
[00:13:08] <pyzozord> I don't like focusing on subsets of things, I don't feel in control

[00:14:35] <epony> the useful grammar and syntax spec is at the end of the textbook.. and in the language specification
[00:14:44] <vysn> I even use vim in the browser, a browser extension called vimium, its handy

[01:14:35] <InPhase> oldlaptop: This has held true for a long time.
[01:16:08] <oldlaptop> That's fine in and of itself; what's not good is that it's become basically impractical to have "minor" ones at all. Once upon a time the KDE people (as one example) could just go build a web engine and not only have it *work*, but do better at standards compliance than the "major" vendors.
[01:16:31] <oldlaptop> That's a laughable idea now.
[01:16:59] <InPhase> Technically Safari is another alternate, and is technically cross-platform, but gets close to zero usage outside of the mac ecosystem.
[01:17:30] <InPhase> Oh, I guess it's not cross-platform anymore.  That could explain it.  :)
[01:17:59] <oldlaptop> Webkit iself is cross-platform - and is slowly slipping.
[01:18:28] <sonny> apple has to maintain it 
[01:18:40] <oldlaptop> (One reason I say "two and a half" is that chrome/blink is technically a webkit derivative - the other half is that it's becoming questionable whether webkit is really a modern-browser engine)
[01:18:45] <sonny> maybe they will see that innovation is less burden ;)
[01:19:01] <InPhase> Right.  Well Google forked Webkit into Blink, so the Webkit branch seems to be Apple-only now.
[01:19:05] <flakland> how can they stockpile trillions of dollars if they pay devs to maintain cross-platform function ?

[01:24:10] <InPhase> Writing a modern C++ compiler by yourself is a massive project.

[01:40:01] <oldlaptop> There appear to be two organizations on Earth that can even *maintain* a reasonably compliant "modern browser", and another one that's still not failing *that* badly, yet. It's not clear either of them could build a new one.
[01:40:43] <flakland> of course they can't, the "standard" evolved that way for a reason
[01:41:23] <sonny> it's just going to be a loud sound when it crashes ;)
[01:42:41] <ProfSimm> Decker: what about a language that is exclusively composed of loops. They loop until you break out of them. Rather than explicitly entering a loop
[01:42:55] <beaky> nice i like linux

[02:08:38] <ProfSimm> ski: what bothers me more is that it's a storage slot conceptually to the user. A named one. Or for function arguments, an ordered one.

[02:12:32] <ProfSimm> ski: instead of directly connecting functions

[02:13:16] <ProfSimm> ski: but it's two concepts because we're limited by the nature of the AST
[02:13:26] <ProfSimm> We can't "nested" everything the way we want without variables

[02:28:05] <[itchyjunk]> why do you ask?
[02:28:13] <[itchyjunk]> i am still confused probably
[02:28:24] <ski> [itchyjunk] : well, consider a graph that consists of three nodes, and three edges connecting them, in a triangle. now, if we have another graph, which contains such a triangle, that means we can *map* the three nodes in the triangle graph to the particular nodes of the triangle inside the other graph. and the edges are mapped similarly
[02:29:02] <[itchyjunk]> yes, we can create such a map
[02:29:10] <ski> a graph homomorphism must map an edge in the first graph to an edge in the second graph, that goes between the two nodes that the original edge's source and destination nodes were mapped to

[02:30:53] <ski> hm, by "furnished/structured set", they just mean a tuple (`struct'/record, if you prefer) containing the set, and also some other stuff (typically operations involving the set)
[02:31:20] <[itchyjunk]> is P(X) plus \subseteq considered structured set?
[02:31:25] <[itchyjunk]> or furnished ?
[02:31:51] <[itchyjunk]> we saw that P(X) plus sebseteq produces a category that you said was thin category

[02:37:31] <pyzozord> isn't everything tuples of things in computer science?
[02:37:41] <ski> pyzozord : yea, the morphisms makes an "image" of one graph, inside the other (which can contain more cruft that we don't care about)
[02:37:46] <pyzozord> tuples of functions are utterly unimpressive for programmers
[02:38:04] <pyzozord> might be quite shocking for mathematicians I suppose
[02:38:24] <[itchyjunk]> this isn't just a tuple of function.
[02:38:34] <ski> also, the image/morphism can be singular / non-injective, in that we could map the triangle graph to a single node (which then must have a loop-edge on itself, since we must also map the three edges of the triangle)
[02:38:41] <[itchyjunk]> but the idea that homomorphism itself being a tuple of function.
[02:38:47] <ski> so, the image need not be "accurate", we may lose "resolution/detail"

[02:42:38] <pyzozord> that sounds actually kind of fun
[02:42:50] <pyzozord> I feel there is some part of math that I'd really like
[02:42:52] <[itchyjunk]> sure high level abstraction after understanding what the invariance is make sense
[02:43:15] <ski> a (multi-)graph is a "multi-sorted" algebraic structure. it has both (a set of) nodes, and (a set of) edges. most other common algebraic structures that crop up have just one "sort"/"carrier"/"underlying set"

[02:45:05] <ski> for a group, we have just a single carrier, say `G', and then three operations `n : 1 >---> G' (neutral element, identity/unit), `m : G * G >---> G' (multiplication/combination), `i : G >---> G' (inverse). these operations must also satisfy five laws (neutral element laws, associativity, inverse laws)

The avialable channels for communication seem a bit over the top to me (I'm no expert with tor and it's been a pain in my ass the few times I've tried to use it in any way other than the default). I did see something about an irc channel tho so I guess I'll check into that.

[05:27:40] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> the next symmetry down in the hierarchy are 'abelian groups' reducing the combinatorial explosion to a mere equation. too bad all 'real' types are pure monoids. no inverses, no commutativity, no structure in the operation

[07:12:55] *** duuude is now known as apple
[07:13:04] * apple sues duuude
[07:13:06] <epony> the model line up is insanity
[07:13:18] <InPhase> MsFoxyEmilySmith: Honestly, when I see a cert of any form, my first thought is that someone was trying to cover a deficiency.  That's not an entirely fair thing to think, because it's not always true, but many certs do not correspond to the same background as one would get by actually doing a thing, and they certainly aren't the same as a thorough education in an area.  It is typically a compressed 
[07:13:18] * apple sues apple for copyright infringement
[07:13:24] <InPhase> overview of some theoretical knowledge without practical application.
[07:13:30] *** apple is now known as duuude
[07:13:40] <InPhase> MsFoxyEmilySmith: So one must wonder why someone went the path of a cert.
[07:13:57] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> that's true
[07:14:14] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> its why I dont get certs unless I have to
[07:14:30] * duuude puts a TLS cert on his resume
[07:14:32] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> although I was thinking of doing one for fun because im bored lately
[07:14:44] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> not sure which 1
[07:15:01] <InPhase> There are a few cases where it makes sense.  People can be straight up about covering a deficiency.  Like you went to college for one major, started working in another area, got a cert for some background knowledge, then started working on proects in the new area a bit, well then that cert is just part of the story as a pathway.
[07:15:32] <InPhase> But if someone drops in with a resume with no education or experience and a cert, you typically can't credit the cert for very much.

[07:16:36] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> if someone has taken a very difficult university level certificate program from MITx for example
[07:16:38] <InPhase> When I see the project I will know you can do things.  When I see the cert, I won't.
[07:16:46] <apotheon> all else being equal, practical project work
[07:16:54] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> would you view them the same as someone that graduated from MIT
[07:17:00] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> or covering a deficiency
[07:17:09] <apotheon> no fucking way would that be equivalent to being a graduate
[07:17:17] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> apotheon: same course work
[07:17:30] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> but they did it on their own, how wouldn't that be the same?
[07:17:32] <InPhase> MsFoxyEmilySmith: But are the assessments done the same way?
[07:17:48] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> in fact I think it'd be better since they were self motivated and weren't scammed into tuition
[07:18:00] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> InPhase let's assume so to simplify things
[07:18:21] <apotheon> I don't think MIT offers online certification of the entire degree major program.  I'd expect quite a few classes to be missing.
[07:18:38] <InPhase> MsFoxyEmilySmith: I taught college.  I had people register for my classes and learn pretty close to nothing.  They didn't pass, because I used assessments, but they registered and could say they "took" the course.  It would not show passing it on their transcript.

[07:19:46] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> InPhase: assessments like assignments? I think most of edX requires regular assignments that are graded
[07:19:50] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> if you do the verified pathway
[07:20:00] <apotheon> If you literally and pretty conclusively showed you had completed all the same work, I would personally grant the same practical educational value for the coursework, but HR and corporations generally would show you the door if they really treated a degree requirement as a hard prerequisite.
[07:20:09] <InPhase> This is one thing one needs to be wary of with self-study.  It hasn't been evaluated unless there is some demonstrated after-product.
[07:20:24] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> they're not as perfect as a moderated exam but pretty good
[07:21:04] <apotheon> I'm the sort who'd want to know what you understand and can do more than where you sat around and listened to someone drone on for hours, though.

[07:25:26] <epony> there are many wannabe jobs and applicants online, working at some company does not equate formal education either
[07:26:26] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> epony: so you think someone with 20 years experience as a Software Engineer is worth less than someone with a 4 year degree in Software Engineering from an accredited institution?
[07:26:46] <epony> I think a cert is not worth the expense and the paper it is printed on.
[07:27:08] <InPhase> apotheon: If they use some sort of proctored exams which are designed with suitable performance verification for an online course, and a comparable level of assessments, with comparable structure, then it's comparable to a course at the institution.  At that point what you call it is "an online course".  But you'll find that will also cost something close to the same.
[07:27:10] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> a university degree is to mp4 format as a certificate is jpeg format

[07:30:34] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> we need educational engineering
[07:30:44] <epony> you need education ;-)
[07:30:47] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> where courses are standardized
[07:30:55] <epony> what kind.. is your choice
[07:31:17] <InPhase> apotheon: Well there are approaches attempted for proctored exams online as well.  Obviously there are limits to what can be done to insure integrity this way, but people have worked hard at trying to do so.  I think you can make it work with certain exam designs such that cheating is not very feasible.
[07:32:03] <apotheon> Sure, but it's like infosec: doing it right isn't easy, fun, or popular.
[07:33:22] <InPhase> In person is substantially easier to verify.  But some fraction of people still try very hard to cheat.  One year I had to write up 20% of my students for cheating, each one for a separate incident.  It wasn't great.
[07:33:56] <InPhase> I was getting good at filling out the forms quickly.
[07:34:34] <apotheon> Corporations like Experian and Sony only care about security-related liabilities in courts, both legal and public opinion, y'know.

[07:35:17] <apotheon> le sad

[07:43:33] <InPhase> MsFoxyEmilySmith: Self-learning was always possible even before MITx.  MITx is a great resource for making structured knowledge more accessible.  But before there was MITx we had these things called textbooks, which are often freely available in libraries and very close to free in older editions.  If someone with dedication, honesty, and thoroughness learned all the material in the textbooks for 
[07:43:39] <InPhase> college courses, and did exercises and projects comparable to what would be done in courses, validating and checking their knowledge as they went along in this manner, that person would know what a college graduate knows in the same subject and should by all sensible rights be treated the same for hiring or other purposes.  Just, realistically, that's rare.  People don't often pull it off on their

[08:48:01] <Rounin> It can be great to combine the two, too... Even if you're working on a compelx application, you can try out a line or small function in your browser or on an online service or wherever you can run small pieces of code
[08:48:12] <Rounin> And then paste it into your large complex application as soon as you know it works
[08:48:20] <Rounin> Though of course, unit tests can help you do the same thing locally
[08:48:58] <tomathy> yes i am always stuck between unit testing and manual debugging

[08:51:00] <Rounin> Yeah... Unit testing is simplest for methods that are mostly stateless
[08:51:20] <arahael> It's said that unit tests let you debug once, but manual debugging is basically figuring things out again, and again, and agian, and again.
[08:51:26] <Rounin> Testing and threading are two areas where functional programming really shines, I think
[08:51:53] <Rounin> Yeah, hehe... Might as well put your debugging flow into a test if you can
[08:52:02] <arahael> Right.
[08:52:24] <arahael> And then it becomes a regression test for later.
[08:52:55] <tomathy> yes when the source code is big enough you need unit tests
[08:53:12] <tomathy> it would be good if someone made a way to transition between debugging and unit testing
[08:54:18] <arahael> There's a bit of work there with mocks.  You can have "record and play" mocks, basically.
[08:54:36] <arahael> Ie, record your unit test using real code, once the interactions have been recorded, you can just play the interactions.
[08:54:44] <arahael> But that approach seems unpopular these days.

[13:17:11] <pyzozord> It makes [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

[16:17:10] <berkhan> bememory: I guess you are mentioning about Vagrant. Yes, it's essentially a virtual machine provisioner that uses simple configuration file called `Vagrantfile` (think like `Dockerfile`). `vagrant-libvirt` is a plugin to use libvirt tooling to run KVM virtual machines on Linux hosts
[16:17:34] <vdamewood> Trashlord: FWIW, this, multiple times: Auto-created primary key used when not defining a primary key type, by default 'django.db.models.AutoField'
[16:18:23] <vdamewood> I reverted to an old version of Django. I'm going to update things incrementally, and eventually I'll cover the new Django stuff.
[16:18:50] <berkhan> bememory: I was having problem with `forwarded_port` feature which `vagrant-libvirt` creates a SSH tunnel. Tunnel is created which I can see; however, I only get previously mentioned error
[16:19:10] <berkhan> bememory: and nobody in #vagrant :-(
[16:19:51] <vdamewood> I decided vagrant wasn't worth it when Hashi ignored my help ticked even though I had a paid version of vagrant.
[16:20:37] <vdamewood> Well, I guess it was really a paid plugin for vagrant.
[16:21:14] <vdamewood> Yay. When I run with an old version of Django, my site works like normal. Now I get to update everything.
[16:23:09] <arahael> berkhan: I vaguely recall that there's two versions of ssh that can be used - one implemented in python, and the other using openssh.  See if you can configure it to use openssh instead.

[20:43:55] <bayaz> Title: C11 and C17 Standard Support Arriving in MSVC - C++ Team Blog 
[20:44:10] <apotheon> Python's package management has tended to have difficulty issues with making sure it works.
[20:44:35] <nomagno> <<Astute readers will note that VLAs are also not supported. Variable length arrays are generally less efficient than comparable fixed sized arrays, and generally inefficient compared to equivalent malloc(), when safely and securely implemented. VLAs provide attack vectors comparable to those of the infamous gets() — deprecated and destined to removal — for opportunities of “shifting the stack” and other exploits.>>
[20:44:45] <oldlaptop> duuude: as for the reason .NET exists in the first place, as opposed to a collection of concepts like VB-on-JVM... I would expect it's solely because Microsoft twenty years ago (dammit, it is just about that long now) was very, very interested in vendor lock-in.
[20:45:38] <nomagno> This has never been an excuse not to implement a feature, specially when you can do stack mashing without VLAs, there's no proof malloc is more efficient on your compiler if you don't implement the alternative, and you changed an international document to suit your implementation
[20:45:51] <oldlaptop> But that's basically historical baggage now, they *have* their own VM, and whatever else is worth bothering with in their VM-language universe happens to be on top of it
[20:46:05] <nomagno> Also, if there was a stack overflow vulnerability on Windows, they'd know it wouldn't they?
[20:46:16] <nomagno> Or apparently now they don't maintain Windows too?
[20:46:30] <nomagno> It is the lowest point of MSVC
[20:46:33] <oldlaptop> nomagno: That's pretty sleazy. The reason gets() is gone (and it is *gone* as of C11) is that *it was literally impossible to use correctly*
[20:46:35] <ProfSimm> apotheon: LINQ looks like SQL but is a small subset of SQL
[20:47:15] <oldlaptop> unless your program controls its own input(?!) gets() *cannot be used correctly*
[20:47:21] <duuude> oldlaptop: That is the thing I believe too, but I am always puzzled on whether there is any sensible reason someone would choose it as a base for their new software.

[20:54:35] <oldlaptop> Mileage presumably varies - I think that's probably the most ergonomic database API anyone's figured out
[20:54:43] <Decker> rows are alread joined with constraints... so when you have 'pets' table any row from it might have .getParent( "owners" ) which gets the rows related to the pets
[20:55:03] <oldlaptop> (Part of it is that Tcl is uniquely suited to embedding random fragments of some other language.)
[20:55:09] <apotheon> ProfSimm: even just linguistic homogeneity, but yeah, homoiconicity is even better
[20:55:50] <oldlaptop> nomagno: The key one is SQL itself. (Or imagine some relational query language filling a similar role as SQL, but that sucks less.)
[20:56:20] <oldlaptop> You get a declarative language, the implementation of which does a lot of the tedious parts of actually using your data structure for you.

[21:25:34] <pulse> just enjoy the wave while it lasts
[21:25:37] <pikapika> Anyways my point is. Windows 98 had low resource usage and yet the ability to distinguish depth and colors within that.
[21:25:57] <nomagno> You don't have to switch styles if you don't want though
[21:26:10] <nomagno> That's the whole point of DEs existing
[21:26:46] <pulse> i predict the next big fad in ui is going to be flat but in pseudo-3d

[21:40:38] <oldlaptop> I don't see how the usual linux installers are objectionable from that perspective then.
[21:41:01] <pikapika> pulse, I would say the most important law of UX is to reduce the number of clicks
[21:41:02] <vdamewood> Yay missing packages.
[21:41:24] <oldlaptop> They don't generally do an intermediate reboot, but that's because they can run the installed system without "rebooting into it"
[21:41:26] <pikapika> For example, in firefox restore closed tab used to be directly accessed from the main menu so two clicks
[21:41:38] <pikapika> Now its buried two levels inside the menu
[21:41:47] <duuude> oldlaptop: Don't they get updates before finishing the installation?

[21:43:10] *** Joins: shiva__ (LordShiva@user/one39dev)
[21:43:11] <oldlaptop> Taking Debian as an example, the process is: (1) partition the disks (2) debootstrap, which copies the "base system" onto the target (it may or may not need to download the stuff it's copying, depending on the installation medium; usually it doesn't) (3) optionally, chroot into the target and install some extra stuff with fundamentally the same mechanism that you would use after rebooting into the new system
[21:43:43] <oldlaptop> No step of this process necessarily involves downloading anything, although nowadays (3) almost always does
[21:43:57] <duuude> oldlaptop: But aside from that, since just copying and getting it to boot is the stressful part and all the rest could be done later, all the rest should be moved to the time after it is installed. 
[21:44:17] <oldlaptop> (3) is, in a meaningful sense, "the time after it is installed"

[21:45:54] <nomagno> I don't think Debian offers you non-free stuff during setup

[21:46:22] <duuude> nomagno: I am talking about the way things should be imo
[21:46:39] <oldlaptop> It's merely a technical detail that you don't have to perform a power cycle to be "running the installed system"
[21:46:42] <nomagno> Well nonfree drivers have no business in setup
[21:46:51] <nomagno> Debian has a strict free/nonfree separation for a reason
[21:47:02] <duuude> I think distros must install with all nonfree stuff included, then you provide an option to disable them

[21:48:48] <pikapika> I think ubuntu overrides that decision anyways
[21:48:52] <duuude> if anyone cares about libre they could disable it later, the graphics driver is not going to hack you in the meantime
[21:49:04] <pikapika> I saw it doing an apt upgrade while installing even when I asked it not to do it
[21:49:16] <oldlaptop> Further, the fact that you're running the installer at all proves that the kernel itself boots, and that you have "a" working bootloader, on the installation medium. The only real tricky bit that remains is the installed system's bootloader.
[21:50:03] <pikapika> oldlaptop, not really. For example
[21:50:20] <pikapika> On one system, sound and wifi weren't working during the install (I used a usb wifi stick)
[21:50:27] <duuude> oldlaptop: Yeah, but I just want to see that happen, then do whatever is neccessary later
[21:50:31] <nomagno> duuude: I argue if so many users need to be babysitted this much and give up this easily, they don't really want to benefit from having any control over the software they run
[21:50:41] <vdamewood> duuude: There are some, many of them FSF supporters who feel it's ethically wrong for them to even install non-free software, even temporarily.
[21:50:44] <pikapika> But at some point in the install, the appropriate upgrade for those drivers was installed
[21:50:47] <pikapika> and it started working
[21:51:07] <pikapika> nomagno, you are blaming the wrong person
[21:51:08] <nomagno> Should Debian offer enabling nonfree repos more easily? Perhaps
[21:51:14] <oldlaptop> What's the real benefit of that? There's, at worst, a very slight risk that some bandwidth will have been "wasted" because it's somehow completely impossible for the bootloader to work.

[22:14:44] <nomagno> I agree
[22:14:48] <pulse> you can effectively sell it if you offer support and your competitor doesn't
[22:14:59] <pikapika> duuude, naturally. If I am working in a company I'd want to use BSD ie maximize others effort without paying back. And likewise if I am releasing something for myself, I'd prefer GPL.

[22:18:13] <pikapika> duuude, yes it does. Its explicitly part of my deal that I dont want to make money off it, and I don't want anyone else to pivot off my work.

[22:18:34] <nomagno> I don't have any issues with contributing to GPL software, but I think the GPL on my works is pointless
[22:18:35] <duuude> pikapika: You have the rights to publish your software in any way, but that is not reasonable and just making it harder for someone else, also losing on potential money you can make.
[22:18:45] <pulse> nomagno, why should someone else profit off my creative work?
[22:18:46] <nomagno> If I transmit an idea or a piece of work, how can I pretend to control what you do with it?
[22:18:50] <nomagno> That's unnatural and dumb
[22:19:04] <pikapika> They are free to use a software with a license that permits it if thats what they want
[22:19:06] <duuude> pikapika: It is just a loss on their side and a potential loss on your side.
[22:19:17] <pikapika> I may be inclined to accept a paid fork in some cases if I get a cut though
[22:19:20] <oldlaptop> That would appear to me to be the GPL-ite position: oppose restrictions on creative works on principle, but purport to use such restrictions to fight them

[22:19:41] <pikapika> oldlaptop, freedoms require protectors of freedom
[22:19:49] <nomagno> It's logistically dumb to try to hamfist restriction into law
[22:19:54] <pikapika> A country requires agents of law
[22:20:00] <duuude> pikapika: And that it is unreasonable to use GPL for "freedom" because it doesn't help that.
[22:20:22] <oldlaptop> (naturally not everyone who has ever released a GPL work holds that position - namely, a lot of people who release GPL works probably do not oppose restrictions in principle)
[22:20:23] <nomagno> I think the GPL helps with keeping the playground free
[22:20:38] <nomagno> But in the end I don't recognize the moral stance you make works for yourself
[22:20:43] <pulse> i see gpl as a failed idea
[22:20:48] <nomagno> You should make them for society, and the rest comes naturally from that

[22:22:10] <pikapika> duuude, how hard is it to accept the simple and fair guideline that you give back the same way you were given it
[22:22:35] <oldlaptop> nomagno: The idea was presumably hard to make, and so it's not unreasonable that you should be compensated for it.

[22:42:27] <pikapika> Good for them. I persnally don't want to rely on just "luck" and "scraps".
[22:43:38] <oldlaptop> nomagno: "public domain" means you explicitly disclaim copyright, which is fundamentally incompatible with offering a copyright license (meaning you claim copyright)
[22:43:57] <oldlaptop> hence "public domain dedications" that are in effect actually copyright licenses
[22:44:10] <duuude> pikapika: If they are going to fork your GPL they are simply going to give you the same scraps, otherwise they wouldn't fork your stuff.

[22:44:58] <nomagno> oldlaptop: The traditional system before someone thought the Berne convention was reasonable, was the the 'Public Domain' wasn't actually a state but just a natural language thing, and copyright was an active temporary state and an economical compromise
[22:45:15] <nomagno> I much agree with this
[22:45:19] <nomagno> And many civil codes still hint or clearly state this
[22:45:31] <oldlaptop> ("sqlite licenses" are actually a sort of warranty that the sqlite authors have the authority to either disclaim copyright or promise not to sue)
[22:45:43] <pikapika> In that case as I said I don't see the point anyways. I have also stated I might be in some cases inclined to allow a paid fork if I get part of the cut. And the good thing about GPL is that it allows me to enforce that.
[22:45:44] <nomagno> It's just copyright is the default now. The public domain is still a natural language thing that is reluctantly codified into law in many places
[22:45:47] <apotheon> Linux effectively won the marketshare wars from a combination of nervousness following the AT&T/BSD lawsuit and the fact the Jolitzes were keeping their cards close to their chests.
[22:46:31] <oldlaptop> IIRC the language also makes them responsible for defending against claims that sqlite is not free for the "licensee" to use, which is definitely worth something
[22:46:42] <apotheon> In the Linux early days, I don't think people involved much realized there were meaningful differences between the different open licenses at the time.

[22:49:27] <apotheon> pulse: If you hold the copyright, yes, you can.
[22:49:40] <apotheon> Corporations are able to weaponize the GPL because of that.
[22:50:01] <apotheon> Anyone is, really, but corporations make a habit of it rather often.
[22:50:17] <apotheon> I mean "weaponize further", considering the GPL is a weapon in the first place.
[22:50:56] <nomagno> apotheon: This is why I don't really like when a corporation releases something under a copyleft license AND doesn't accept contributions

[22:52:46] <nomagno> apotheon: However, if a GPL project has the few properties required for a license change not to be possible, I think it works pretty well
[22:52:48] <apotheon> Does Amazon apply the GPL to things?  I hadn't noticed.
