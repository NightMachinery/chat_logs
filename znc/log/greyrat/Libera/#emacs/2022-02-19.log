[02:14:23] <deviantfero> I use exclusively web-mode
[02:14:38] <deviantfero> for all javascript/typescript/html/erb/php
[02:14:47] <deviantfero> vue and svelte
[02:15:03] <deviantfero> it works better than js2, js2 used to crap out on me often
[02:15:17] <deviantfero> and it didn't really support typescript when I used it
[02:15:23] <deviantfero> we're talking about 4 years ago tho
[02:15:36] <deviantfero> I'm still using web-mode everyday, and it gets the job done
[02:15:51] <Devon> Until you type M-;
[02:16:32] <deviantfero> what does that do? comment?
[02:17:20] <deviantfero> it works fine on my end... just tested it, unless it does something different in your setup?
[02:17:29] <bpalmer> if it's using /* */ rather than <!-- -->, that suggests it is using javascript style comments. Which seems reasonable enough (not many people use <!-- --> comments heavily)
[02:18:02] <bpalmer> or you want it to switch among the comment styles based on whether javascript or html is active?
[02:18:07] <deviantfero> for me it switches appropiately

[04:50:15] <earthToAdam> http://ix.io/3PZZ/javascript
[04:50:46] <johnjaye> suggestions? it's 272 lines and a lot of that is setting up the infrastructure for minor mode
[04:51:08] <johnjaye> earthToAdam: i use applescript to launch emacs on macos but i forgot the reason. i think it had to do with environment variables
[04:51:23] <earthToAdam> Why does this work from my browser's console but only returns undefined when called from my AS/elisp wrapper?

[04:54:14] <earthToAdam> johnjaye no worries. I'm just whining because there's nobody in the JS channel.
[04:54:23] <bpalmer> you're talking ot the same browser? Add some logging/output, and a last 'else ' fo r the class that neither getSelectnion nor selection is around

[04:56:39] <bpalmer> metroidvania games lead you down strange pathways.
[04:56:52] <earthToAdam> Haha I'm using the JS to scrape content from the browser to pipe into a clippings.org file. Applescript glues it all to gether.
[04:57:55] <earthToAdam> This is the applescript that goes with it http://ix.io/3Q01
[04:58:39] <aidalgol> Why AppleScript?
[04:59:01] <aidalgol> holy shit, this is still as bad as it was in the '90s... O_o
[04:59:40] <earthToAdam> AppleScript needs to tell Safari to execute the JS.
[05:00:57] <earthToAdam> The use case is: I navigate to a page, highlight some text I want, hit a keyboard shortcut and the clipped html gets piped to pandoc and converted into org syntax and saved to my clippings.org file.
[05:00:58] *** Joins: namsdrawkcab (~user@user/namsdrawkcab)
[05:03:04] <earthToAdam> So far, I have this working with plain text... but I like this script because it pulls out the html, which I can then send to pandoc for auto-formatting to org-mode...
[05:04:07] <earthToAdam> I feel like I need some async/await logic or something in the AS to make it wait for the content to return...

[09:16:40] <johnjaye> or you meant how to get json to begin with?
[09:18:05] <johnjaye> json.el might not be the place to look. that file seems to assume you already have the json extracted
[09:19:19] <Ox151> from what i saw, it says it parse and return json object at point, and mainly was wondering if a buffer returend from url-retrieve-sync could be passed in or if i have to do something else to the url-buffer
[09:20:33] <johnjaye> well. is the contents of hte url json?
[09:21:14] <johnjaye> if it is, your options would be use the string manipulation functions i saw in json.el. or create an empty buffer, copy the json into it, then do whatever

[10:16:18] <dale> LogicAside: What would you auto-complete in a YAML file, absent something like a schema?  Internal references?
[10:16:47] <LogicAside> That would be good. I do have a schema though, I'm currently on the investigating how to use it track
[10:16:53] <dale> LogicAside: Or are you looking for something like dabbrev, which IIRC is bound to M-/ by default?  That just tries to complete based on other strings in the buffer.
[10:17:23] <dale> LogicAside: Lately I've been using lsp-mode + https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server for that.  IIRC lsp-mode will auto-install that server.
[10:22:23] <blacked> what command should i put to install `use-package` , rather doing it automatically using package-install, i want to do it manully install just like use-package

[10:24:28] <blacked> i want to install packages , like for eg `all-the-icons` on emacs

[10:24:53] <blacked> oh sorry , i do not want `package-install`
[10:25:06] <Andrew> Question (from someone new to emacs that isn't me but gets relayed by me): Is there a way to make emacs behave like a "normal" (i.e. gedit-like) text editor?

[10:28:22] <blacked> but i dont want to do that , because, like if i want to copy my config, on another machine, i have to manually  use package-install and install `use-package` and then only other packages available in private init.el

[10:32:09] <nnnnn> You could bootstrap use-package via package.el. That needn't be "manual", it can be done programmatically in your init file.
[10:32:30] <nnnnn> Basically (unless its-installed  (install-it-with-package))
[10:32:53] <blacked> oh  :)
[10:33:08] <nnnnn> Then you can use use-packages :ensure keyword or set the variable use-package-always-ensure to imply that keyword on every declaration.
[10:33:50] <johnjaye> doom uses use-package iirc
[10:33:54] <johnjaye> it's a declarative config right?
[10:34:05] <johnjaye> so you say xyz package and it downloads them if you dont' have it?
[10:34:23] <LogicAside> dale, lsp-yaml-select-buffer-schema and the like solved my problem :)
[10:34:26] <nnnnn> Doom uses use-package to configure packages and straight.el to install them.
[10:34:59] <johnjaye> that explains that message about using straight when it installs
[10:35:17] <nnnnn> straight.el integrates with use-package by adding the :straight keyword and a variable which implies that globally (straight-always-use-package)
[10:35:27] <blacked> i wanted to be minimal builtin , installing straight.el makes heavy
[10:35:52] <johnjaye> right now i have a minimal init.el that doesn't install packages and tries to be cross-platform

[15:45:38] <jimeh> Lisp has lists, functions, and values… and I believe that’s it… lol
[15:45:53] <yabobay> but why
[15:46:01] <Andrew> why do you need more?
[15:46:11] <gnoo> that's a design decision. makes it simple
[15:46:27] <Andrew> Also, yabobay you should look at Lisp macros
[15:46:35] <Andrew> It's the simple syntax that allows for so much in macros
[15:46:45] <bremner> yabobay: you're asking us to justify design decisions that literally date to the 1950s
[15:46:59] <bremner> good or bad, they are pretty established now...
[15:47:03] <Andrew> You need car and cdr plus a few extras to invent your own syntaxi n lisp
[15:47:16] <yabobay> i wasnt rly asking you to justify it, i just thought since it's your preference then you probably have a reason for liking it better and i wanted to know
[15:47:31] <Andrew> I like it because clarity
[15:48:06] <jimeh> The way I think about lisp is that it’s essentially all just data, like a math expression: (5 + (2 * 10))
[15:48:07] <Andrew> Even when writing Haskell, I use ((+) 1 2) insted of (1 + 2)
[15:48:26] <Andrew> * (+ 5 (* 2 10))
[15:48:37] <jimeh> Except you can make the computer do stuff with your data expressions…
[15:49:22] <yabobay> well i guess code doesn't have to look like traditional math syntax
[15:49:35] <Andrew> yabobay: Do you think that (defun f (x) (* 2 x)) is a function?
[15:49:48] <yabobay> what's defun?
[15:49:58] <Andrew> think of it as define-function
[15:50:04] <yabobay> uhhhhhh
[15:50:07] <yabobay> i'm gonna say yes
[15:50:17] <yabobay> it makes the function f, which takes the argument x?
[15:50:27] <Andrew> That last part is true
[15:50:31] <Andrew> But it isn't a function itself
[15:50:39] <Andrew> It defines a function called f
[15:50:46] <yabobay> but you write it the same way you'd write a function
[15:50:49] <Andrew> (lambda (x) (* 2 x)) is a function
[15:50:57] <lampilelo> yabobay: here, if you want to understand lisp a bit more: https://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/lisp.html
[15:51:21] <yabobay> spooky long text
[15:51:22] <Andrew> Lisps are usually not typed, and I don't know elisp's types...
[15:51:32] <Andrew> But I'd use fake type names here:
[15:51:36] <lampilelo> yabobay: may be long, but it's not painful to read
[15:51:53] <yabobay> i reckon it probably would be painful for a not programmer
[15:51:53] <lampilelo> and i think it's valuable
[15:51:55] <Andrew> (defun f (x) (* 2 x)) gives a symbol

[15:52:06] <lampilelo> ah, maybe
[15:52:08] <jimeh> Basic syntax is pretty much just: ( …)
[15:52:15] <yabobay> ohhhh defun isn't a function cause it doesn't return anything!!
[15:52:16] <yabobay> but lambda does
[15:52:21] <Andrew> While the lambda gives something like (Num x) => x -> x if you know haskell syntax
[15:52:32] <Andrew> It evaluates to the name of the function you just defined
[15:52:51] <Andrew> i.e. (defun f (x) (* 2 x)) evaluates to 'f
[15:52:58] *** Quits: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[15:53:01] <Andrew> But it does have a side effect, i.e. defining f
[15:53:10] <yabobay> would setting a variable to the result of a lambda in lisp be an acceptable thing to do?
[15:53:26] <Andrew> Sure
[15:53:30] <gnoo> it's pretty common
[15:53:37] <Andrew> And that's how I write scheme
[15:53:41] <yabobay> and that defines a usable function?
[15:53:44] <yabobay> what's scheme
[15:53:44] <Andrew> Well, I use (let)
[15:53:47] <gnoo> yes
[15:53:51] <Andrew> Scheme is a simple dialect of Lisp
[15:54:00] <yabobay> oh yeah that's another thing with lisp
[15:54:05] <yabobay> why are there so many of 'em
[15:54:16] <yabobay> as opposed to like every other language out there
[15:54:19] <gnoo> you can do (funcall var-which-has-function args)
[15:54:20] <Andrew> if you say "x", it looks for a variable "x"
[15:54:22] <jimeh> Cause lisp has been around since the 50s… lol
[15:54:23] <yabobay> it's a result of people not wanting to accept their fate lol
[15:54:44] <Andrew> If you say "'x", it means the symbol "x"
[15:54:45] <jimeh> Even C has a few variants with C++ and C#…
[15:54:59] <Andrew> You can think of symbols as strings, but they're not

[15:55:21] <Andrew> What do you guys use for playing with elisp?
[15:55:35] <Andrew> yabobay: It depends
[15:55:54] <Andrew> I'd say most C programs are valid C++ programs
[15:56:05] <Andrew> But a lot of Scheme propgrams aren't valid common-lisp programs
[15:56:07] <jimeh> Some lisps are very similar, others less so, depending on the goals for the specific flavor of lisp…
[15:56:15] <yabobay> then why does c++ code look so alien
[15:56:24] <Andrew> That's personal opinion
[15:56:26] <gnoo> yabobay: it's best to see (info "(eintr) Top") to understand a little bit of elisp.

[16:07:50] <bae> it used to be that on the rare occasions I would want to view the contents of a .docx file, I could open it in Emacs, and SOME mode would display it. Now, all it does is open it in Zip-Archive Narrow mode (That's what it says on the mode bar/line/thingy). Did I possibly remove some package that gave me that functionality?
[16:08:30] <Andrew> artefact: I just get used to it and I like using purely functional languages for everything
[16:08:44] <Andrew> bae: Probably?
[16:08:46] <jimeh> Personally I think main thing that annoys me with lisp is probably that it’s harder to skim-read a bunch of lisp compared to say Python, Go, Ruby etc, partly cause there’s more common visual structures than in lisp due to the nature of the syntax… and especially with Go if it’s formatted correctly with gofmt…
[16:08:52] <artefact> probably my fault. my brain is too rotten from a decade of perl

[17:17:45] <wasamasa> what you choose for minibuffer completion isn't necessarily related to that
[17:18:07] <wasamasa> the problem is that you're not completely explaining the UX you're looking for
[17:18:17] <wasamasa> for example, I use helm
[17:18:29] *** Quits: sabas3dgh (~textual@85.9.98.2) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[17:18:39] <wasamasa> helm does this thing in its file completion where it waits for you to type out enough letters of a directory component, then automatically jumps into that directory
[17:18:51] <wasamasa> but you still need to type out enough letters of that directory for it to do that
[17:19:02] <wasamasa> you cannot jump into the right directory by only knowing the letters of the file
[17:19:18] <wasamasa> for that you'd need to have completion provide the list of full paths, then offer you completion on that
[17:19:28] <wasamasa> which is unrelated to the completion framework you use

[17:27:15] <blacked> ohhhh to go to that file
[17:27:41] <GuessWhatBBQ> Sorry. I explained it a bit before but here's the details. This is a plugin for neovim that adds smooth scrolling for half-page/full-page motions.
[17:27:41] <GuessWhatBBQ> https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41967813/121818668-7b36c800-cc80-11eb-8c3a-45a4767b8f05.mp4
[17:27:56] <wasamasa> smooth scrolling is not precise enough
[17:28:09] <wasamasa> it doesn't help emacs gained pixel-level scrolling through a terrible hack
[17:28:41] <GuessWhatBBQ> So when I use C-u or C-d. I want the motion to sort of ease in and out
[17:29:04] <GuessWhatBBQ> The plugin I mentioned is actually scrolling by lines

[17:41:26] <wasamasa> I've briefly looked at these commands and part of the problem is that emacs allows too much freedom
[17:41:42] <wasamasa> anyone can write a movement command that may scroll the window
[17:42:01] <wasamasa> so most of these solutions add a wrapper around a set of built-in movement commands that make them "smooth"

[19:36:02] <johnjaye> that's why my init.el starts out defining 10 or so variables like scrolling and column width or whatever
[19:36:12] <wasamasa> everyone new to emacs wants line numbers and hate how slow they are

[19:36:23] <wasamasa> it took how many years for someone to step up and make it happen?
[19:36:32] <johnjaye> meaning line numbers in the mode line or line numbers in the side bar?

[21:19:44] <catern> (M-x global-set-key works interactively, but doesn't persist the binding)
[21:20:31] <catern> maybe there's a way to insert the sexp I just executed into a buffer?
[21:20:42] <catern> er, insert the command I just executed interactively, as a sexp
