[00:04:53] <znf> BtbN, in the current form (from a licensing point of view), could Debian distribute ffmpeg binaries with nvenc enabled?
[00:05:01] <znf> or JEEB!
[00:07:07] <BtbN> of course they could
[00:07:21] <JEEB> IANAL, but in FFmpeg itself it only requires the nvidia codec headers which are generally described as pretty liberally licensed. so I'd say checking the nv-codec-headers and if they're kosher for debian then I don't see any problem
[00:07:33] <JEEB> and I think debian/ubuntu already package the nv-codec-headers?

[15:55:04] <znf> durandal_1707, why wouldn't it?
[15:55:15] <znf> Kingsy, what do you get when you run that?
[15:56:25] <Kingsy> znf: it comes out just fine, but there are no subs.
[15:56:37] <Kingsy> running it again now just to make sure I didnt have a typo
[15:58:03] <JEEB> what is the size of the canvas that sub2video picks? and what is your video resolution?
[15:58:10] <JEEB> -v verbose should log this tuff
[15:58:12] <JEEB> *stuff
[15:58:12] <znf> durandal_1707, just fyi - you can perfectly overlay subtitles on video
[15:58:14] <znf> I've done that for ages
[15:58:25] <znf> (although with DVB subtitles not PGS)
[15:58:26] <durandal_1707> znf: graphical ones
[15:58:47] <JEEB> also I recommend scale2ref before overlay to make sure the subtitle canvas and video res match
[15:59:11] <JEEB> otherwise you might have stuff not visible since the video surface I think starts from top left (0,0) co-ordinates
[16:00:02] <znf> dvb subtitles are graphical ones :)
[16:00:08] <znf> and afaik so is PGS

[18:08:34] <znf> what's the issue tough?
[18:08:41] <znf> becasue it says it's working
[18:08:56] <JEEB> yea so it's trying to render 1920x1080 subpictures onto 720x576
[18:09:16] <Kingsy> there was no subs.
[18:09:18] <JEEB> > Stream #1:0: Subtitle: hdmv_pgs_subtitle, 1920x1080
[18:09:39] <Kingsy> JEEB: oh so I need to tweak the command somewhere?
[18:10:53] <znf> https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#scale2ref
[18:11:24] <JEEB> the problem is that sub2video (part of ffmpeg.c) is picking the default resolution fallback for some reason
[18:11:31] <JEEB> not sure what it utilizes as hints there
[18:11:55] <JEEB> I think it loops through video streams from the same input (which there are none)
[18:12:04] <JEEB> but I wonder why it doesn't actually check the resolution of its own stream

[21:11:04] <durandal_1707> give short samples and commands you use

[21:12:48] <furq> scale2ref,overlay
[21:13:05] <furq> you can't use 0 or 1 as output labels
[21:13:23] <furq> or maybe you can but i would guess it makes a volcano erupt somewhere

[21:14:05] *** Joins: Kei_N (~Kei_N@user/kei-n/x-2886111)
[21:14:11] <furq> , passes the outputs from scale2ref into overlay

[21:15:09] <furq> or scale2ref[a][b];[b][a]overlay if scale2ref returns the outputs in the wrong order
[21:15:10] *** Quits: blaze (~blaze@user/blaze) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)

[21:15:23] <Kingsy> Cannot find a matching stream for unlabeled input pad 1 on filter Parsed_scale2ref_0
[21:15:23] <furq> you still need the [v] at the end if you're using -map

[21:18:24] <furq> maybe [1:s][0:v]scale2ref
[21:18:38] <furq> i guess it's not autodetecting the subtitle stream

[21:19:24] <furq> you still need [a][b] after scale2ref
[21:19:27] <durandal_1707> Kingsy: what ffmpeg -i that_pgs.pgs file says?
[21:19:53] <Kingsy> oh wow ok so thats running
[21:20:18] <furq> run it with -t 60 and make sure it's doing the right thing
[21:20:25] <furq> also you probably want to set some encoder options or it'll look bad
[21:20:43] <JEEB> if you don't get subtitles you're still running into the canvas size bug since nothing is setting ifilter->{width|height} from the subtitle codecpar, and it falls back to 720x576 canvas
