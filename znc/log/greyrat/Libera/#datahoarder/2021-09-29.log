[03:09:25] <skye0_mobile> you may think different but this is how someone believes AA/12 steps is a cult or cult-like
[03:10:48] <skye0_mobile> and of course this is one person's story, but after briefly going to a 12 steps program where everyone had to say "I am an X addict", it did feel vaguely cult-like to me
[03:15:05] <NiLon> it is a cult, literally
[03:15:53] <NiLon> most of the steps are about god
[03:16:17] <NiLon> and you need to fully submit and worship said god to reach that goal
[03:17:17] <NiLon> so a cult, in all context and purpose
[03:18:47] <skye0_mobile> yeah i hate that for a lot of places even in developed countries, the only solution to breaking free from alcohol is AA/12 steps. I'm trying to avoid alcohol so medical professionals won't signpost me there and so i can get good at this game which requires me to be alert and sober
[03:18:57] <skye0_mobile> and alcohol abstinence reeks to me of christian fundamentalism
[03:20:10] <skye0_mobile> i think prohibition and sweden and norway's alcohol monopolies all existed because of the temperance movement or something like that. even straight edge reeks to me of christian fundamentalism. good idea to avoid drugs and sex but it feels a bit on the nose to try and make a big show and dance of its supposed superiority
[03:20:13] <NiLon> you could seek out secular AA groups
[03:20:48] <skye0_mobile> ,get https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperance_movement#Origins_(pre-1820)
[03:20:49] <unfinity> Temperance movement: 
[03:20:51] <NiLon> not that many in contrast but they are out there
[03:20:56] <skye0_mobile> i'm avoiding anything to do with 12 steps, period
[03:21:04] <skye0_mobile> even if they were secular

[03:21:22] <skye0_mobile> <3
[03:21:31] <sarnold> pff see if I try to give pizza to a duck again...
[03:21:45] <NiLon> secular AA's only steps are forward
[03:22:16] <sarnold> twelve of em... kinda seems like a lot. is there anything that involves a couch or recliner?
[03:22:42] <NiLon> no, there are no 12 steps in secular AA
[03:22:57] <NiLon> 12 steps are about god, secular AA doesn't have god nor religion
[03:23:13] <NiLon> no prayer, no god, no pretending of some higher power
[03:23:30] <skye0_mobile> not sure if i would like to do that, i'd rather find and use my own path to alcohol abstinence or moderation
[03:24:37] <NiLon> groups in general are not for everyone, but they help many people
[03:24:40] <skye0_mobile> i can see how avoiding alcohol is a good idea and my father in the past even abused alcohol quite a bit but the whole notion of alcohol abstinence reeks to me of christian fundamentalism; granted, i know some LGBT atheists who have never had alcohol
[03:24:54] <NiLon> just the fact that you are not alone with the problem is often a big step forwards
[03:25:23] <skye0_mobile> i just want to get good at this game and games and alcohol don't often mix (especially fast paced ones that require good coordination and attention)
[03:26:01] <skye0_mobile> sleep too. i should be asleep but i don't like this time zone and i don't want to use drugs to keep me asleep. i guess i'm not in a good mood, that may be what's keeping me up. i'm just not feeling happy or whatever

[03:30:08] <NiLon> there are two forms of alcohol abstinence, one that is by choice and another is by meh, not interested
[03:30:44] <sarnold> heh
[03:30:48] <sarnold> so true
[03:37:04] <skye0_mobile> The latter I tend to be more sympathetic to. I still hate how throughout history alcohol abstinence movements have been strongly tied to Christianity. There's other faiths that have pretty much always forbidden alcohol but Christianity was one of the ones that permitted it, like those who don't prefer to associate with Christianity or any of the other faiths that forbid alcohol.

[03:46:58] <NiLon> there was this old sobriety club that had quite strict rules, first one was that you may only take 3 shots during dinner and if you have fish then one extra. Second one was that you make take one shot at morning, then at 11am and last one at 18pm. Fourth one was that beer and wine is not limited

[17:57:36] <joepie91> evilgohan2: it's already done actually :p
[17:57:55] <joepie91> And it works!
[17:58:54] <evilgohan2> :)
[18:00:59] <joepie91> Friend ended up using bodge wire for wiring the connector, and then soldering that to some old salvaged led wires from an old 90s PC, and commoning those together and abusing an SMD 8 pin IC breakout board as a VCC/GND distribution board and ultimately wiring the whole shebang to a pin header
[18:01:06] *** Joins: MrZeus__ (~MrZeus@185.248.85.56)
[18:01:47] <joepie91> Oh, the voltage setting resistors were also on the distribution board, folded down with an insulating pad in-between
[18:02:19] <joepie91> End result is a spec compliant USBC retrofit :p
[18:05:28] <joepie91> the connector itself is mechanically lodged in a two-part custom-3D-printed shell
[18:05:28] <joepie91> which is friction-fit inside of the microphone casing
[18:05:28] <joepie91> so it all stays in place no matter how much force you put on the connector, despite the connector not actually being soldered to the PCB

[19:09:43] <Myself> I've never understood the complaint. Like don't you want your property value to go up? Isn't that a good thing? seems to me that the problem isn't rising property values, it's low percentages of home ownership. Renters don't benefit from rising property values.

[19:15:24] *** Joins: jake- (~quassel@45.146.7.22)
[19:15:29] <evilgohan2> Due to an extreme lack of terminology
[19:15:44] <evilgohan2> That's a priviledged viewpoint devoid of nuance and understanding of the macro socioeconomic and political effects of it.
[19:16:19] <evilgohan2> On the surface, sure. Gentrification looks fine. Property values go up. New businesses (ideally) come in. 
[19:16:26] <evilgohan2> Rising tide lifts all boats and all that.
[19:16:29] <evilgohan2> Yeah...
[19:16:32] <evilgohan2> That's not how it works.
[19:16:34] <evilgohan2> Let's talk reality.
[19:18:18] <evilgohan2> In reality, what actually happens is that places - for all their faults - typically have a defined culture. Gentrification usually kills that. Viciously.
[19:19:12] <Myself> Okay, but how? I honestly don't understand this and i'm super curious to, because a lot of people I respect seem to think it's a very big deal, and I've just never been able to get my head around it.
[19:19:13] <evilgohan2> Ironically, crime increases. Not actually increases, but it does on paper. This is the result of quality of life complaints. People gathered playing live music (as in they're playing on instruments) at 6PM? Call cops to make a noise complaint.
[19:19:21] <evilgohan2> That's not an exaggeration. that literally happened in New York.
[19:19:23] <evilgohan2> And D.C.
[19:19:30] <unfinity> ・゜゜・ ​ 。。・゜゜\​_o< FLA​P FLAP!
[19:19:34] <evilgohan2> ,bef
[19:19:34] <unfinity> evilgohan2 you befriended a duck in 4.761 seconds! You have made friends with 185 ducks in #datahoarder.
[19:19:54] <Myself> Yeah, that happened about 2 miles from me, the new condos that advertised "being in the heart of it all", were now phoning in complaints about the drum-circle that'd been meeting in the park behind the library for 15 years.
[19:20:15] <evilgohan2> Such gives the existing population the impression that those gentifying are less new residents and more "invaders" (or, for lack of better terminology, colonizers)
[19:20:24] <evilgohan2> Property values increase, but so does cost of living.
[19:20:48] <evilgohan2> 99 times out of 100, the place being gentrified is occupied by persons who are low income, and are likely either Black or Latino
[19:20:55] <joepie91> Myself: "property value goes up" sounds really good if you're a homeowner and it feels like free money; but when you're renting it means that your rents go up to a point where you can no longer afford them, thereby driving you out forcibly, cutting you off from your existing social network
[19:21:03] <joepie91> not to mention auxiliary costs of living
[19:21:08] <evilgohan2> Many of whom are likely older and have fixed income.
[19:21:17] <evilgohan2> When property values go up, so do property taxes.
[19:21:37] <Myself> joepie91: Yes, exactly as I said, the problem is low home ownership. Convert renters into owners and the problem goes away, no? 
[19:21:43] <evilgohan2> If your property goes from being assessed at $150,000 one year to $500,000 the next (once again, not an exaggeration), you're fucked.
[19:21:53] <joepie91> the idea that gentrification produces 'mixed neighbourhoods' is basically propaganda, it never actually does because that is not how the economics work. the only way that could possibly work is if you have effective rent control, which no such place does
[19:22:00] <evilgohan2> And you can't just sell. Because everywhere else has gone up too.
[19:22:10] <Myself> There are caps on how much property values and taxes can rise, especially without a change of ownership, specifically for this reason. Do those not work?
[19:22:13] <evilgohan2> The only places that haven't are going to be poor quality neighborhoods.
[19:22:15] <evilgohan2> No there aren't.
[19:22:16] <joepie91> Myself: I think you underestimate just how difficult it is to buy a home
[19:22:44] <Myself> No, I know it's difficult to buy a home, I just think instead of railing against gentrification we should rail against barriers to home ownership
[19:22:59] <evilgohan2> So what inevitably happens 9999 times out of 10000 is that the people who lived their previously, once again disproportionately Black and Latino, get pushed out by gentrification due to
[19:23:01] <evilgohan2> rising home prices
[19:23:04] <evilgohan2> rising property taxes
[19:23:06] <evilgohan2> rising costs of living
[19:23:10] <Myself> because telling people not to move to somewhere attractive and affordable is stupid, you cannot fight simple logic and math
[19:23:15] <evilgohan2> quality of life complaints
[19:23:17] <joepie91> "converting renters into owners" sounds great on paper but it completely ignores just how *expensive* it is to buy a home, how there are a ton of people who do not have access to mortgages or who could not responsibly obtain one, it doesn't account for social housing *at all* (which intentionally operates at a loss)
[19:23:18] <evilgohan2> etc.
[19:23:28] <evilgohan2> Also, you can't just convert renters into home owners
[19:23:39] <joepie91> Myself: gentrification isn't the result of people moving, it's the result of housing policy
[19:23:44] <joepie91> it doesn't "just happen"
[19:23:46] <joepie91> it's deliberate
[19:23:47] <Myself> how so?
[19:23:53] <evilgohan2> and also, what precisely do you think those barriers to home ownership are? Because, ironically enough, the very gentrification you're promoting is one such barrier.
[19:24:05] <evilgohan2> Also, it is indeed deliberate. See: blockbusting.
[19:24:08] <evilgohan2> Red lining.
[19:24:10] <evilgohan2> etc.
[19:24:11] <Myself> I'm not promoting it, I'm saying I don't understand it. 
[19:24:29] <Myself> but I do appreciate the perspective in between putting words in my mouth.
[19:24:33] <joepie91> here in NL, cheap social housing gets torn down and "upgraded", by which they mean building less and more expensive apartment blocks in their place, most of which is privately owned
[19:24:46] <joepie91> that is policy, not a law of physics
[19:25:05] <joepie91> it is 100% preventable
[19:25:12] <joepie91> other places that are experiencing gentrification have similar policy issues driving it
[19:25:18] <joepie91> though the details vary by locale
[19:25:20] <evilgohan2> Pretty much the same here - mostly resulting from the viewpoint that people hate welfare -- or, more aptly, people hate who they perceive to benefit from welfare.
[19:25:59] <Myself> if the point of social housing is to operate at a loss, but they sell the social housing and build posh lofts instead, it sounds like the blame rests with those who sold the social housing in contravention of its purpose
[19:26:14] <evilgohan2> Additionally, keep in mind that a lot of those neighborhoods that are being gentrified were previously neighborhoods that were sequestered as "Black only" by way of housing policy. See: Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, New York, etc.
[19:26:38] <evilgohan2> see, the problem with assigning "blame" is that it is too narrow
[19:26:55] <skye0_mobile> basically i pretty much have a legitimate reason to stay put at this expensive place besides just not wanting to leave this town - if i go somewhere poorer i price those poor people out
[19:26:55] <evilgohan2> The scope is broad and covers multiple facets going back literally 150 years.
[19:27:09] <skye0_mobile> especially if i somehow manage to attract more richer people to live with me or something
[19:27:18] <joepie91> Myself: that is not how social housing systems work.
[19:27:21] <joepie91> they are not privately operated.
[19:27:37] <joepie91> their destruction and/or replacement are a result of deliberate government policy
[19:27:39] <evilgohan2> skye0_mobile: Ironically enough, yes. That is potentially the end result. It doesn't have to be, but that is the way things typically go.
[19:27:42] <joepie91> err
[19:27:45] <joepie91> destruction and/or sale *
[19:27:53] <evilgohan2> I'm going to use New York and Washington D.C. as an example
[19:28:07] <Myself> I thought you just said "building less and more expensive apartment blocks in their place, most of which is privately owned"
[19:28:11] <evilgohan2> New York housing prices have historically been some of the highest in the USA. It got that way pretty bad in the early 2000s.
[19:28:12] <skye0_mobile> also, sorry i've been out, i'm thinking of possibly holding a solo demonstration at my town as i'm getting sick of theses covid denialist fucks
[19:28:25] <skye0_mobile> it won't be loud and proud, just silent with writing on cardboard
[19:28:26] <joepie91> Myself: yes. the *newly built* things are largely privately owned, replacing social housing that wasn't - that's the problem.
[19:28:41] <evilgohan2> But even among people in New York who couldn't afford homes, their net incomes and worth was largely relatively high compared elsewhere.
[19:28:44] <Myself> how can they replace it? two things cannot occupy the same physical space at the same time, matter doesn't work that way
[19:28:46] <evilgohan2> So they went South to D.C.
[19:29:00] <evilgohan2> and, in the mid-2000's, gentrified it FAST and hard.
[19:29:16] <skye0_mobile> also people want to use their privately owned homes as a free source of income so it almost always prices out new buyers
[19:29:20] <joepie91> Myself: come on, this isn't that difficult to understand. previously an area contained social housing blocks. then those housing blocks are demolished, and new blocks are built in their place, which are less dense, more expensive, and largely privately owned.
[19:29:21] <evilgohan2> The existing population disappeared within 2-5 years because they were priced out.
[19:29:27] <evilgohan2> They could no longer afford the cost of living.
[19:29:36] <evilgohan2> Ironically enough, many of those homes were then converted to rental units.
[19:29:50] <Myself> joepie91: who sold the social housing to allow the demolition? what happened to the program that ran the housing with a purpose?
[19:30:00] <evilgohan2> and their costs went from $200,000 for a typical row home to literally $1.5 million for an empty lot.
[19:30:25] <skye0_mobile> business is a cult that holds on to 19th century sensibilities in some ways
[19:30:33] <joepie91> Myself: the social housing organizations that used to operate them, because government policy essentially requires them to do so to stay afloat financially (they are quasi-government organizations)
[19:30:46] <joepie91> Myself: what happened to the program is that it got wrecked by neoliberal policy.
[19:30:54] <joepie91> like so many things in NL
[19:30:59] <Myself> wait, requires them to hold onto it, or requires them to sell it? 
[19:31:06] <joepie91> the privatize-everything crap
[19:31:23] <joepie91> Myself: requires them to sell it
[19:31:30] <joepie91> they can't stay afloat otherwise
[19:31:54] <joepie91> https://vng.nl/nieuws/helft-minder-sociale-huurwoningen-door-verhuurdersheffing
[19:32:12] <joepie91> that is the main thing that is deliberately wrecking their finances
[19:32:19] <joepie91> a tax specifically for large social housing corporations
[19:32:35] <skye0_mobile> i'm getting worried as my local housing co-op hasn't contacted me. i'm looking into alternatives like council housing but i still have barely any luck
[19:32:54] <joepie91> so they now no longer have enough money to build new social housing, or even continue operating, requiring them to sell off social housing in lucrative (ie. gentrifying) areas
[19:32:59] <joepie91> to make up the difference

[21:06:28] <rmmh> ,bang
[21:06:28] <unfinity> rmmh you shot a duck in 2.684 seconds! You have killed 116 ducks in #datahoarder.
[21:06:40] <rmmh> once you have enough housing stock you can start talking about rent control and shit
[21:06:56] <rmmh> but the cities with the worst housing conditions (SF) have waaay more demand than supply
[21:09:27] <imMute> rmmh: is that counting unoccupied but not for sale houses as part of the supply or no?
[21:09:55] <rmmh> yes
[21:10:13] <rmmh> there's no way to allocate extant housing in sf to everyone that lives there in a way that doesn't suck
[21:11:51] <joepie91> rmmh: building more housing (or, in many places, converting office/retail space to housing) is indeed part of the problem - but no, it doesn't replace conversations about eg. rent control
[21:12:17] <joepie91> because if you don't very intentionally design policies based on "housing as a basic human right that the government is obligated to provide for", the *wrong* things will be built
[21:12:29] <joepie91> high-profit-margin, low-density, upper-class housing
[21:12:41] <joepie91> this is even more applicable in the united states of suburbia
[21:13:01] <joepie91> so "building more" needs to be part of the discussion, but only *part*
[21:13:43] <joepie91> (the whole "the wrong things get built" is in fact *precisely* what has been happening in NL for the past decade or so)
[21:13:45] <rmmh> if by some miracle developers were allowed to build a 30 story condo in SF they would do it instantly
[21:13:59] <joepie91> 30 story buildings are also the wrong thing
[21:14:00] <rmmh> and then you'd have a few hundred more houses in a spot that would have a dozen
[21:14:04] <joepie91> just wrong in a different way
[21:14:04] <rmmh> are they, though?
[21:14:06] <joepie91> yes
[21:14:14] <joepie91> too far from the ground floor, breaks social cohesion
[21:14:15] <joepie91> mid-rise is optimal
[21:14:29] <rmmh> tokyo hasn't had rental prices increase in the last 20 years
[21:14:31] <joepie91> that allows for local communities to flourish while also providing density
[21:14:33] <joepie91> it's also much cheaper
[21:14:38] <rmmh> because they allow basically unconstrained building
[21:15:02] <joepie91> honestly the culture in Japan is so wildly different from that in the US and Europe that you can't copy-paste any kind of policies
[21:15:18] <joepie91> it's the same reason I use NL as a benchmark for trains and not Japan
[21:15:35] <joepie91> (even though Japan's train system is in many ways better)
[21:25:33] <sarnold> tokyo also has declining population, so there's much less reason for rents to increase there
[21:25:41] <sarnold> s/tokyo/japan/ sorry
[22:00:00] <skye0_mobile> people who complain about the shit state of communist housing should be glad they have a roof over their head, but if the houses actually cause health problems, it should be a cause for concern too
