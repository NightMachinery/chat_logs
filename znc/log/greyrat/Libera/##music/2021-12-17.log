[00:14:14] <buZz> DOMF: come on , we can restart :P
[00:14:24] <DOMF> <buZz> hence, downloading however many TBs of jpegs doesnt make you owner of that carrier <-- Neither does having an NFT! 
[00:14:26] <buZz> which camp do you wanna be
[00:14:34] <DOMF> You can make a NFT of someone's work without their permission
[00:14:41] <DOMF> that doesn't give you the copyright over it
[00:14:47] <buZz> right, you can buy reproductions of reproductions
[00:14:53] <buZz> neither gives you copyright
[00:15:07] <DOMF> so what good is an nft
[00:15:24] <buZz> what good is a artists ability to get paid for digital art?
[00:15:27] <buZz> hm well
[00:15:32] <buZz> i agree most artists are shit
[00:15:42] <buZz> so its kinda keeping shit alive :)
[00:15:44] <DOMF> artists can get paid for digital art with existing monetary infra
[00:15:50] <DOMF> there's nothing that nfts add to it
[00:15:52] <buZz> sure, they can
[00:16:09] <buZz> why should we decide what they agree on with their buyers though?
[00:16:24] <buZz> often i've done gigs for just a hotelroom and some crates of beer during
[00:16:39] <DOMF> I don't get your point 
[00:16:40] <buZz> should you get to decide on that aswell?
[00:17:20] <DOMF> I was asking what benefit using an NFT brings to the table and you reply with a question about if we should decide on what artists agree on
[00:17:25] <DOMF> which does nothing to answer my question
[00:17:43] <buZz> oh, well resellability while pointing to validity from the artist, for instance
[00:17:58] <buZz> and some of those NFTs even do a kickback to original issuer on every resale
[00:18:07] <DOMF> but it still requires the existing copyright infrastructure to verify that
[00:18:17] <buZz> sure, its just a fancy receipt
[00:18:18] <DOMF> Because, like I said, I could take anyone's art and make an nft of it
[00:18:26] <buZz> like a certificate with a MtG card or something
[00:18:41] <buZz> you cant be sure the certificate is valid without external evidence 
[00:18:52] <DOMF> so it's bringing nothing new to the table
[00:18:54] <buZz> on NFT there some cryptographic proof though , so could be easier
[00:19:05] <DOMF> only adding complexity (and power usage)
[00:19:06] <buZz> well, kickback on resale is kinda new
[00:19:15] <buZz> no,  whole of cryptocurrency is literally nothing new
[00:19:26] <buZz> all the tech preexisted in one shape or the other
[00:19:34] <buZz> incl nfts, blockchain, mining, etc
[00:19:51] <DOMF> And I don't believe that there's any good use for any of that yet either
[00:20:03] <buZz> you dont believe in currency? oh well, i guess
[00:20:09] <buZz> i like a free society better too
[00:20:34] <DOMF> woohoo lets burn a small nation's worth of coal to generate electricity to solve sudokus we can trade for heroin!
[00:20:37] <buZz> the good thing about currencies is that there's so many of them , you can just use a different one
[00:21:05] <buZz> yeah banks do use a lot of power, but they're important to keep the heroine trade capable

[03:28:23] <artao> i've not yet watched that video. i'm watching that chords video
[03:28:28] <artao> good stuff thx louipc :)
[03:28:30] <piercedwater-> i could never remember how to do the tricks lol
[03:28:38] <artao> lol
[03:29:06] <artao> i never really did much bike tricks. i skated
[03:29:14] <artao> and you don't really do "tricks" on mtn bikes
[03:29:46] <piercedwater-> the closest thing i do to tricks on a bike is go downhill really fast
[03:29:48] <artao> bikes are kinda scary to do tricks on cuz when (not if, when) you fall it's too easy to get all tangled up with the frame
[03:29:58] <artao> a skateboard you can usually just kick or throw away from you
[03:30:07] <artao> and rollerblades/rollerskates?
[03:30:19] <artao> i'll pass on having the wheels actually strapped to my feet thx 
[03:30:25] <piercedwater-> same
[03:30:25] <artao> tho i DO enjoy quads now and then

[03:30:41] <piercedwater-> what's quads
[03:30:54] <artao> old school roller-skates. 4 wheels
[03:31:02] <piercedwater-> ah yeah i remember those
[03:31:10] <artao> since both quads and blades are technically roller skates
[03:31:11] <louipc> trick1 jump. touch nose
[03:31:19] <louipc> trick2 jump. touch ear
[03:31:27] <piercedwater-> my kinda tricks :D
[03:31:36] <louipc> trick3 jump touch left foot
[03:31:42] <louipc> trick4 jump touch right foot
[03:32:06] <louipc> infinite tricks
[03:32:40] <artao> does jumping count as "tricks?" cuz i have done a fair bit of that
[03:32:50] <artao> but just straight jumping. no tabletops or spins or anything
[03:32:55] <artao> so i'd say no. not "tricks"

[03:33:23] <artao> bent the handlebars even

[05:20:55] <artao> Der Film ,,Metropolis" wurde bald nach der Urauffuhrung stark gekurzt und verandert.
[05:21:17] <artao> i wanna pick a scene from Metropolis and write a soundtrack for it
[05:21:28] <artao> i think it'd be a fun exercise
[05:21:37] <artao> maybe even do the whole movie and put it up on my channels
[05:22:05] <artao> Metropolis is, after all, 100% free to use for anything. WELL beyond copyright
[05:22:55] <artao> pretty sure all silent movies are (well, from the silent movie era. there's modern movies that are silent for stylistic reasons. such as Call of Cthulhu by The H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society. awesome movie
[05:23:15] <artao> as is their Whisperer In Darkness. not a silent movie, but still early style
[05:23:25] <artao> imo it's better than the former

[05:55:41] <murthy> I am off to bed now, see you all later
[05:55:47] <artao> i'll hafta watch Metropolis A LOT to start "hearing" music for/to it
[05:55:50] <artao> sleep well murthy
[05:55:58] <murthy> you too
[05:55:59] <artao> and get subtitles
[05:56:04] <murthy> sweet dreams
[05:56:08] <artao> my german isn't up to the task
[05:56:58] <Panther> hmm
[05:57:48] <artao> no way
[05:57:53] <artao> hmm?
[05:58:02] <Panther> I think first, the major population centers, and other non-military critical infrastructure, so that way, there could be retaliatory strikes that would continue to cause damage.
[05:58:23] <artao> i .... see
[05:59:09] <Panther> The submarine forces would be the last to deploy their weapons.
[06:00:03] <Panther> .. if you didn't actually want to win a nuclear war, but just wanted to do as much damage as possible, what the primary targets should be to make sure the secondary responses, etc... were still capable of causing more damage.
[06:04:01] <Panther> Especially with enough warheads, you could take out dams, mines, reserve supplies of water, food, fuel, transportation hubs, NAPs, all sorts of manufacturing and telecom centers....
[06:05:06] <artao> OH! that
[06:05:08] <artao> yeah
[06:05:18] <artao> there's this awesome game called DEFCON
[06:05:24] <artao> sadly, it no longer runs for me
[06:05:48] <artao> nuclear war. nice calm relaxing soundtrack. pretty much no sound effects. a War Games like interface
[06:05:56] <Panther> :)
[06:06:05] <artao> there's another, ICBM, but i don't yet have that one
[06:06:11] <artao> i'm pissed that DEFCON no longer runs
[06:06:19] <artao> nice relaxing global thermonuclear war
[06:06:42] <artao> the subs can also be used as first strike to take out radars and launch sites
[06:07:05] <artao> i have now shaved my right lower leg
[06:07:08] <artao> why?
[06:07:32] <artao> to electrocute the calf muscle. i've not been keeping up on my PT and they've quite atrophied

[18:17:48] <nativetexan> easy games...P~~~

[18:18:13] <SummerSkies> i didn't do that fuckin shit till 7th grade dude, 13 years old

[18:18:37] <SummerSkies> i dontt hink i knew you could do that for a while but still
[18:18:53] <SummerSkies> i just thought the star drops were for some meaningless bonus or something
[18:19:16] <SummerSkies> but at the end of the false credits it shows an enemy that you never face in the game that looks really powerful, and it shows a question mark next to the end
[18:19:31] <SummerSkies> and my brother and I pieced it together that has to mean something and what if we get all those things that we never cared about before
[18:19:51] <nativetexan> yeah, i gotchya SummerSkies

[20:52:29] <Panther> I was trying to set an akick that would give a reason, but this dopey bot has every damned operation set to a separate flag.

[20:54:36] <nativetexan> yeah
[20:54:38] <Panther> With this one, they have to be set separately or in grops.. which oddly.. having ops is a lot more power than setting an akick. *shrug*

[20:57:07] <Panther> Really.. 1000 only lets me poke into its data structures and also shut it down gracefully.

[20:58:30] <Panther> Killing off the pseudoclients won't stop the process, and I have a respawn command that will regenerate them. :)
[20:59:25] <Panther> Even if you SQUIT the 'server', it won't stop, and it will reconnect.
[21:00:06] <nativetexan> kick them, then re-invite them knida thing?
[21:00:15] <Panther> Well
[21:00:30] <Panther> squit causes a whole server to leave the network.
[21:00:40] <nativetexan> ah, ok
[21:01:28] <Panther> So, if the server is a 'service' like the chanserv/nickserv, etc... many times those die when the socket closes, but this won't do that. It will reinitiate a connection.
[21:01:39] <Panther> You'd have to do a lot of work to get rid of it.
[21:02:46] <Panther> Lots of times, especially in the past, Ircops had to squit and connect servers because of routing issues when the Internet ha such limited bandwidth.
[21:03:02] <Panther> These days, the routing that gets set up is mostly stable.
