[01:30:41] <etimmons> How? I doubt anyone here would really consider you a guest any more
[01:30:43] <theothornhill> I'm working on a compiler where I have an AST, and a hash-table with keys as type names pointing to ast nodes.  I want to access both of these regularly from other functions.  What is best practice here?  I was thinking of creating a macro such as `with-ensured-ast` that either returns a memoized ast and hash-table or initializes one.  Or I could suck it up and ensure that all functions that need them get them as parameters.
[01:31:05] <theothornhill> Is dynamically binding it the way to go?
[01:32:27] <theothornhill> Now i just remember to (let ((*schema* (build-schema "..."))) ...) everytime I do things
[01:32:55] <semz> I'd probably go for a dynamic variable, especially if that table is essentially global during the compilation.
[01:34:02] <theothornhill> Yeah, it is. So you just decide the entry point, bind it and hope for the best?
[01:35:02] <White_Flame> +1 for defvar.  It's side-band contextual information for your accessing calls
[01:35:19] *** Joins: jpl01 (~user@2001:16b8:4958:4c00:e970:62e1:adda:dadb)
[01:35:42] <theothornhill> Ok thanks, I'll get back to it then :)
[01:36:38] <semz> Yes. If you want a little less hoping during development, it might help to set the variable's default value to something that cannot possibly do anything but blow up instantly.
[01:36:44] <White_Flame> btw, I'd also make a with-ensured-ast which creates the dynamic bindings for you
[01:37:48] <semz> e.g. NIL if it's a hashtable, or :invalid if it's a list. Not always possible though, depending on the intended type.
[01:38:15] <White_Flame> DEFVAR can actually leave the value unbound, too
[01:38:22] <theothornhill> Yeah, I was just putting that off until I made a decision
[01:38:25] <White_Flame> well, bound with no value, or whatever it's properly worded as
[01:39:14] <theothornhill> Well the ast is just an instance of an object and the table a table, so nil will break things nicely
[01:41:05] <semz> Neat, that avoids the edge case where there is no good value.

[02:44:04] <phantomics> quick question: is there a standard way in CL to make a rational number other than (/ x y)? In SBCL, there's a sb-kernel function called (build-rational) that does this, but I can't find anything that's implementation-independent

[02:44:21] <Guest74> rationalize

[02:48:18] <semz> if you're building them from integers, / seems like the obvious way

[05:22:00] <phantomics> hobo: for curses, you should check out the croatoan library
[05:24:02] <phantomics> The concept of curses is pretty simple: you can get the dimensions of the screen, move the cursor to a given point and enter characters. What you want to do is keep track of where the user's cursor is, and then when a new message comes in, you rewrite all the text in the chat area above the entry area, then when finished, move it back to where the user had the cursor before the message came in
[05:24:17] <phantomics> That way the text entry process feels seamless for the user
[05:29:26] <hobo> to be clear, would i need to write a separate curses client, or can I just send the telnet client the screen buffer?
[05:30:33] <hobo> i wonder how i'd get the client's screen size.
[05:33:07] <phantomics> curses has a method to get the screen size, croatoan exposes it, see: https://github.com/McParen/croatoan/blob/master/test/evolution.lisp
[05:33:16] <phantomics> As for buffers, not sure

[07:47:20] <hayley> I guess LispWorks uses another float parsing algorithm?
[07:47:43] <phantomics> I guess, I've found a few inconsistencies in its float handling
[07:48:11] <phantomics> It also has a tendency to lock up a lot during intensive April computations, maybe it's a problem with the multithreading

[07:48:58] <hayley> Ouch.
[07:52:12] <phantomics> ECL sometimes locks up once or twice when doing the intensive demo test suite, but LW locks up a dozen times or so needing manual restarts. SBCL, CCL, and ABCL get through it fine.
[07:53:24] <beach> I think you should report it to LispWorks.  I am sure they will appreciate the feedback.
[07:54:32] <phantomics> I figured they'd send me a bill for requesting tech support

[18:40:45] <AndrewYu> Hey there- I'm here to ask: How feasible would it be to create a Lisp dialect that's as powerful as common lisp, but slightly more elegant (like towards Scheme). An example would be cleaning up the eq equal = eql mess. I'm pretty new, so I'm not sure how many of those pragmatic/syntax comprimises there are. I'd appreciate somehow a list of those weird comprimises. Thanks!

[18:43:36] <jackdaniel> AndrewYu: equality is a hard problem :) regarding question of how to make something as powerful as common lisp but more elegant (i.e more tailored for your taste), create a separate package that doesn't USE the package CL and define your own abstractions

The fact that you recognize that you are new, should also perhaps indicate that what you consider "weird compromises" may in fact exit for good reasons.

[19:32:41] <Guest74> :)
[19:32:56] <Guest74> I guess you can't.
[19:34:26] <Guest74> it seems any time I try and ask questions related to developing a stable api I get no feedback.  I guess I might be weird in trying to develop a comfortable stable api first instead of not changing an api so that it remains stable.
[19:35:01] <jcowan> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_puzzles doesn't explain this particular puzzles, but the rest on that page are all of the same type.
[19:35:32] <beach> Guest74: Is this the IOCTL API still?
[19:35:37] <jackdaniel> I'm not sure how many questions and where you have asked but I agree that starting with an API and only after then implementing is not a good idea unless you have specification
[19:35:38] <jcowan> You don't know if it's comfortable until you've actually used it.
[19:36:07] <Guest74> I'm a big fan of not writing a specification until you have something that works nicely.
[19:36:29] <jackdaniel> sounds cool (another "fan" pun)
[19:36:40] <Guest74> beach: ioctl, drawing,  x11 utils, etc...
[19:37:24] <beach> Guest74: I don't recall seeing a suggested API.
[19:37:40] *** Joins: lisp123 (~lisp123@5.30.23.247)
[19:37:41] <jcowan> I think almost the opposite: write a spec followed by tests and code, and be prepared to change any of them as you go.  At the end they should all agree (modulo inevitable bugs).
[19:39:04] <jcowan> I always tell someone implementing one of my specs to complain if something is too hard or Just Wrong, because the fault is most likely in the spec.
[19:40:46] <Guest74> i would think the first part of writing a spec would be getting feedback from people in the field, as was done with the common lisp spec.
[19:41:29] <beach> Guest74: Did you give links to the suggestions you want feedback on?

[19:43:31] <jcowan> Sure.  Or proxies in the form of existing implementations.
[19:43:49] <_death> you start with something instable and use it in diverse contexts, each time changing it to fit while keeping other desiderata.. with such use, it may become more stable.. writing documentation or tests help because these are very different contexts of "use"
[19:44:33] <Guest74> that's what I currently do.  Trying to clean everything up now.

[19:46:48] <Guest74> beach: what I was talking about yesterday was representation of linux key symbols.
[19:48:11] <jackdaniel> that wasn't a very comprehensible proposal now, was it?
[19:48:14] <beach> Guest74: I think you need to write down a fairly complete suggestion and then provide a link to it.
[19:48:52] <Guest74> it's a representation of a keysym, how much detail do you need???
[19:49:26] <beach> Never mind.
[19:49:41] <jackdaniel> a good start would be i.e some context :)
[19:50:05] <beach> I was going to say that, but decided to drop it.
[19:50:07] <Guest74> I guess nobody uses keysyms in linux.
[19:50:25] <beach> Context and issues, pros and cons, stuff like that.
[19:52:36] <Guest74> keysyms map key codes, what you get from a keyboard, to a printable or non printable symbol, such as TAB or Keypad-1.

[20:07:38] <etimmons> <https://github.com/cl-plus-ssl/cl-plus-ssl/issues/138> and the later comments on <https://github.com/cl-plus-ssl/cl-plus-ssl/issues/114>

[20:09:57] <etimmons> Apple decided that loading the unversioned libcrypto or libssl should abort the process. Then, Monterey introduced a change (seeems to be a bug, but who knows with Apple) such that calling dlopen on a non-existent absolute path will result in the OS "helpfully" searching some standard locations to try and find the lib
[20:11:23] <frgo> Ah! Hm. - I have my own way of dealing with things like this: Do not assume any "load paths" within a CFFI library definition. This *has* to be decided by the OS. So I always set my DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH accordingly and have no issues like that.
[20:11:51] <etimmons> cl-plus-ssl tries to load the library from a bunch of places to deal with macports/homebrew/fink/pick your poison. If the first one it tries doesn't exist, your process is aborted

[20:13:03] <etimmons> Yeah, it seems like the solution is going to be similar to what you want. cl-plus-ssl will likely try only the system provided libs. If you want anyother version you have to set it up some other way.
[20:13:31] <frgo> Using my approach just solves this kind of issue - putting the burden on the application user or a clever script around the application.

[20:28:44] <Guest74> _death: greek-\i\o\t\a doesn't seem like a good compromise.
[20:28:59] <_death> Guest74: so use strings
[20:29:32] <_death> Guest74: if you want symbol like properties, you can define an "atom" abstraction
[20:30:16] <Guest74> strings could work, you lose eq though.
[20:30:44] <beach> AndrewYu: As _death pointed out, these are very old conventions.  Are you trying to make Lisp more attractive to newbies who don't know these conventions?  I am afraid what you are suggesting then won't work.  EQ is not one of the reasons Common Lisp is not more widely used.
[20:30:58] <jackdaniel> then use :|greek-iota| if you don't like backslashes
[20:31:19] <Guest74> which is what my question was about.
[20:31:30] <_death> Guest74: you could also use try readtable-case, modern mode, writing your own reader, etc. I'm not sure what will satisfy you
[20:32:25] <Guest74> which is what my whole question was about, having inconsistency in some symbols having pipes and others not, or going to long form
[20:33:01] <_death> you should also know that :C-|iota| is the same as :|C-iota| given the default readtable case
[20:34:08] <_death> || is just escaping syntax
[20:34:22] <AndrewYu> I'll be back in around, ugh, 18 hours... sorry though
[20:35:23] <jackdaniel> Guest74: just as _death said, || is not part of the symbol name, so it does not introduce an inconsistency
[20:36:02] <jackdaniel> depending on the readtable-case you may be forced to write |EQ| if you want to use this /terrible terrible/ symbol name :)

[20:39:51] <beach> AndrewYu: That's fine, but then you are in the wrong channel.
[20:39:56] <Guest74> it is inconsistent as in you have to type it. If you want to use autocomplete to see all greek symbols you can't.
[20:40:55] <Guest74> but then again, doesn't seem anybody has a problem with that.
[20:41:48] <_death> Guest74: that's a bug in autocomplete

[20:43:45] <phantomics> In terms of improvements to CL, I might like to see some functions that do similar things condensed into a single function that takes options to work in different ways

[22:16:07] <lisp123> (like :test). Also equal DOES mean a lot of different things - is it the same object? is it an 'equivalent' object, is something based on a particular criteria for equality

[22:27:22] <lisp123> I tried contacting him one to no luck. You probably have a better chance of forking the repo and adjusting it to your needs
[22:27:25] <hobo> just now*
[22:28:28] <hobo> and it turns out I was mistaken. It actually enters a CRLF, writes message, and then rewrites the prompt.
[22:28:35] <Guest74> I'm not concerned about my needs, i'm concerned how my stuff works on everybody elses machine.
[22:29:27] <lisp123> Then you should definitely fork it, amend it to your requirements and include that as part of your delivery mechanism
[22:29:42] <Guest74> at least I've determined constants over keywords.
[22:30:03] <Guest74> I do not think bundling emacs stuff with a common lisp library is a good thing.
[22:30:23] <lisp123> that's why you should learn (Mc)CLIM
[22:30:53] <Guest74> no thank you.
[22:31:08] <Guest74> which uses the same broken model as clx.
[22:31:12] <lisp123> *shrugs* good luck

[22:47:21] <engblom> Is it somehow possible to use strings as keys in property lists?
[22:48:27] <engblom> If I have something like ("a" (:A 1 :B 2) "b" (:A 3 :B 4)) I get nothing with (getf my-plist "a")
[22:48:29] <rain3> engblom why not use :|keyWoRDS| ?
[22:49:14] <White_Flame> alists are more flexible
[22:49:19] <White_Flame> at least in terms of support functions
[22:49:21] <engblom> rain3: The key will actually be a string that I will have to use. Keywords are converted to upper case.
[22:49:43] <rain3> engblom: use | |
[22:50:20] <rain3> (let ((my-plist '(:|a| "a's value" :|A| "A's value")))
[22:50:20] <rain3> 		(list (getf my-plist :|a|) (getf my-plist :|A|)))
[22:50:29] <White_Flame> there is reader conversion, but (intern "FooBar" (find-package "KEYWORD")) => :|FooBar|
[22:50:52] <rain3> ;=> ("a's value" "A's value")
[22:50:56] <White_Flame> however, that means that you'll also need to search the plist with an interned symbol, too

[22:54:26] <engblom> White_Flame: And how would I convert the other way, from keyword to string?
[22:56:27] <White_Flame> symbol-name
[22:56:37] <White_Flame> which is just a field accessor of the symbol
[22:56:44] <rain3> 3(string :|keyWORD|)
[22:56:56] <White_Flame> but, if it makes more sense to keep things strings, then use alists instead of plists
[23:01:13] <engblom> This is the beginning of one of the plists I have: https://pastebin.com/JsN5Wqmv

[23:04:11] <engblom> It was for plists like this I needed to write the recursive forms of getf/setf.

[23:04:35] <White_Flame> alists allow you to use :key, :test, etc
[23:05:18] <White_Flame> and it's easier to use plain list operators on alists than plists, because on alists there's a 1:1 correspondence between list entries and alist mappings.  With plists it's 2:1 and can get funky
[23:06:04] <White_Flame> depending onthe size of your tables, you might want to consider hashtables as well
[23:06:13] <engblom> White_Flame: Is it possible to nest alists, like I have done in the pasted example? Or would you keep the inner list as a plist?
[23:06:24] <White_Flame> plists are legacy
[23:06:40] <White_Flame> but key=>value is just data.  the outer container doesn't care what's inside the value slots
[23:07:28] <White_Flame> however, I think the one advantage that plists have is that you can (setf (getf ...) ..), which I don't think you can do as simply with alists
[23:07:49] <White_Flame> but can do as easily with hashtables
[23:08:10] <engblom> White_Flame: The lists will be around 100 pairs long, so hastables are probably overkill. Besides, the lists are actually are actually handwritten in a configuration file and then read in by read-from-file
[23:08:57] <White_Flame> that handwritten form doesn't need to be the canonical format at runtime, though.  You can read it in as an easy-to-hand-edit list, and then store it in another format, too
[23:09:24] <White_Flame> optimize the former for editing, and the latter for runtime access
[23:14:13] <engblom> doplist from alexandria seems to be able to loop over a plist with string keys, so it should be easy to convert it to a hash table by inserting each key and value.
[23:14:32] <engblom> Or would there be a better way to convert this plist to a hash table?
[23:17:29] <engblom> Clojure has this nice syntax for hash maps: {:key1 1, :key2 2}. Is there something similar I could directly read in from a file with common lisp?
[23:18:16] <yitzi> engblom there are hash-table to plist conversion functions in Alexandria.
[23:19:49] <yitzi> There are also various packages which define a reader macro character for hash tables. Or you could just define your own.
