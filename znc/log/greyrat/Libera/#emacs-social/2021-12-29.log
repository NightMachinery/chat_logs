[22:49:31] <manu1> hi
[22:49:37] <manu1> only few people here
[22:49:51] <manu1> why not call it "antisocial"? :P
[22:49:53] <corwin> true
[22:50:00] <corwin> we might have to change it :P
[22:50:08] <manu1> looking for german ebookz
[22:50:17] <manu1> so hard to be german :/
[22:50:31] <manu1> tried to read english books but it is even harder
[22:51:17] <corwin> You are on the wrong IRC network if you are hoping to score copyright protected works to download.
[22:52:24] <manu1> never said so
[22:52:50] <manu1> also, who are you? the irc police officer inspector corwin :D
[22:53:11] <manu1> xD
[22:53:25] <manu1> wish i could run emacs on my fire tablet
[22:53:53] <corwin> lol, more like an emacs user hoping to keep the channel(s) in the good graces of the staff on libera.chat
[22:55:42] <manu1> ah shh..... ok let's pretend to be serious acting now
[22:55:57] <manu1> so uhm, do you sir, uhm... like the all new modus themes from prot?
[23:06:27] <corwin> I do.  I use them a fair bit, though not as my standard.  I'm a "fruit salid" colors person.
[23:08:36] <manu1> :D
