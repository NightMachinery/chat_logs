[00:00:39] <sney> maybe sync?
[00:00:44] <PMT> I think the partition table on that is fictional, since md devices aren't usually partitioned directly IME (cf. the "partition table: loop")
[00:01:47] <PMT> Likewise for LVM LVs.

[00:03:12] <PMT> Evidently loop is what it reports when it can't find a partition table signature it recognizes but it does recognize a filesystem, but it will write partition tables to those.

[00:06:05] <PMT> I'm not saying you can't do what you're doing (though I genuinely don't know if Linux will show e.g. md0p1, p2, ...), but I usually expect it to be used for individual filesystems, not whole disks.
[00:06:17] <PMT> (Unless the whole disk is only going to contain a single filesystem anyway...)
[00:07:01] <PMT> Anyway, IME parted is a buggy piece of shit, assuming md0 is not actively in use and does not have any data you care about, I'd use wipefs on it to clear any signatures for anything and then try to partition it.

[00:08:56] <tjcarter> does it? huh. That ought to be an easy fix at least.
[00:09:03] <PMT> The bug has been reported for years at this point, AFAICT nobody cares.
[00:09:17] <tjcarter> That's starting to be a theme. 😞
[00:09:55] <PMT> Actually, that might not be true. There was one parted bug that was open for years and isn't even fixed in bullseye but was fixed in sid's version when I looked. Perhaps this was also.

[00:11:06] <tjcarter> I don't think any of that applies to parted though
[00:11:15] <PMT> That tracks with some of my experiences.
[00:11:22] <tjcarter> an off-by-one is an obvious and fixable bug.
[00:11:51] <PMT> Though usually I phrase it as "corporate governed projects often don't fix bugs that don't affect the big-paying consumers of the software in a timely fashion"
[00:12:42] <tjcarter> PMT: I _do_ have a pretty significant bias when it comes to Gnome because I went to file a bug in 2013 only to find it was filed years earlier. An accessibility bug. It's still there.
[00:13:00] <PMT> tjcarter: I have a number of biases about such things.
[00:13:16] <tjcarter> Cinnamon fixed it, XFCE doesn't have it, Gnome … doesn't care.
[00:13:27] <PMT> Fun fact: the bug I mentioned above was something like "if you put in an invalid command, parted will then crash on the second invalid command you put in"
[00:13:37] <tjcarter> And always with Gnome the response to people asking about these things is "You don't need that."
[00:14:19] <PMT> Gnome seems to have decided they want to invent a phone WM on desktops.
[00:14:20] <tjcarter> In other words, Gnome devs are pompous asshats who tell people what their disabilities are and are not, and how they need to use their computers. "You're holding it wrong".
[00:14:51] <PMT> tjcarter: without disagreeing with your statement, I would remark that this is no different than their stance on non-accessibility features.

[00:20:08] <PMT> Given that, IIRC, IBM were the ones who are so cautious about covering their own ass that asked for written permission to do evil with the "do anything not evil" licensed software, I would not be surprised if they jumped pretty hard if this were pointed out to them.

[00:36:13] <kveroneau> tjcarter, oh that's awesome!  I used to always just copy out the kernel/initrd and squashfs image into my /boot and boot it directly via grub.  This ISO method will make it so much easier.

This is easy with the create 644 user group line, but I can't use actual names that exist on the local host. Instead I need to be able to use specific user IDs that do not exist on the localhost.
[02:58:35] <kittonian> Because I am remapping IDs into docker containers, I have to do things like chown 500000.500000 which would equate to userid 0 which is root

[09:03:34] <sney> not with apt, but you can change hibernation behavior in your desktop env's settings, or I think sometimes /etc/logind.conf depending on your setup
[09:03:51] <sney> (if your system supports secure boot, turning it on will also disable hibernate)

[09:12:55] <PMT> If software can physically harm your hardware, that sounds like a claim of defect against the hardware vendor.
[09:14:11] <sney> maybe SSD damage FUD, from some irresponsible combination of writes and rewrites

[09:14:39] <jason1234> well, a reset - holding 0/1 for a while is known to potentially cause a possibility of disk damage. never heard? - so how to remove hibernation with a command line?
[09:15:24] <sney> depends on your system. describe your system, maybe more specific information.
[09:15:39] <jason1234> I use LEGACY only, due to foss conviction, i..e libre software strategy. no uefi to promote windows.
[09:16:33] <jason1234> acer notebook, iwth a lid. systemd will detect the lid change and hibernation starts. All freezes of course. KDE desktop here.

[09:20:29] <sney> ok, so in system settings->power management, what does it say to do when you close the lid
[09:21:24] <jason1234> sney: shell or bash command please
[09:21:47] <sney> answer the question first, because if you're using a kde desktop, the kde desktop is deciding these behaviors
[09:22:11] <sney> if you want a magic answer then go sprinkle a circle of salt on the floor and light some candles
[09:22:12] <jason1234> yeah, but still, shell or bash command please would be greatly welcome.

[09:28:50] <sney> you seem like you have some beef with systemd, which is not unusual here, but most likely irrelevant;
[09:29:42] <sney> in the meantime you have ignored my attempts to find more details, and you're using a desktop environment that generally doesn't allow configuration via command line as far as I'm aware;
[09:29:52] <sney> so, pfft, google it.

[12:58:49] <Khepra> systemd does what it's told to do. it's told to mount the LV. it can't. it assumes that't not what the admin wanted, halts to prevent data loss and damage
[12:59:11] <Khepra> so either make sure the critical FS is always there, or mark it nofail but then ensure depending services don't start without it present
[12:59:45] <dob1> and I just use a live cd and add nofail to that mount, it's enough? or I still need chroot?

[13:17:33] <Khepra> now to address the elephant in the room:  xfce with i3 for wm? how does that work.
[13:18:31] <Haohmaru> what's the problem?
[13:18:45] <mihaiadrian> Khepra: well, xfce settings -> session & startup -> remove xfwm4 and the xfce desktop deamon
[13:19:01] <mihaiadrian> & add i3 to startup
[13:19:11] <Haohmaru> both xfce and lxde are kinda "modular" and you can change the "modules"
[13:19:27] <mihaiadrian> and that's it. i get to keep the xfce4 bar, and xfce's settings
[13:19:30] <mihaiadrian> gtk themes, everything

[14:06:18] <shad> Hi, i wanted to install StarUML to make some diagrams, but get the error ; "Package libappindicator3-1 is not installed.". This package has been removed for debian Bullseye, and is only available in buster's APT repo. Can i install that lib manually by downloading its .deb or will i run into issues ?
