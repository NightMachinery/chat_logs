[04:58:52] <igemnace> stdout
[05:00:13] <Umeaboy> You mean /dev/stdout ?
[05:01:12] <bookworm> they mean the terminal window when you do git push
[05:01:26] <bookworm> quite literally the feedback you get
[05:01:49] <Umeaboy> Right. Sorry. My bad.

[05:03:55] <Umeaboy> I THINK I have the right password since I added my SSH key to my account.
[05:04:04] <Umeaboy> I could be wrong though.
[05:04:24] <igemnace> np. the remote URL you're pushing to doesn't seem to have the username for HTTP basic auth
[05:04:36] <igemnace> if you have an SSH key, better to replace your remote URL with the SSH one
[05:07:13] <Umeaboy> That worked. Thank you so much.

[12:05:43] <lpapp> hi, unfortunately, my colleagues preferred merge into the long-lived feature branch that we work on rather than rebase from main to catch up.
[12:06:39] <lpapp> This really messed up the history though, I can no longer check only the commits made by us in this branch by git log -X. I even tried git log main..feature, git log main...feature, and git log main feature... none of this gave me the commits we made in this branch. The commits from main got intermingled with out commits. Is there a command to get our commits only in this branch for review?

[12:12:11] <j416> lpapp: maybe, git log --first-parent yourbranch ^branchpoint  # where branchpoint is the commit you first based the branch on
[12:12:22] <bookworm> you merged feature into main or main into feature?
[12:13:35] <j416> lpapp: or simply, git log --first-parent branchpoint..yourbranch
[12:13:50] <j416> (thought maybe the first syntax was clearer here)
[12:14:09] <lpapp> bookworm: my colleague caught up with main in our feature branch by a merge from main to the feature branch
[12:14:26] <lpapp> If he had rebased it, this would be a no issue, but he did not want to do that because it is a "shared" branch.
[12:14:40] <lpapp> j416: unfortunately, I have no idea about the branchpoint.
[12:15:35] <igemnace> in general, though, git log --first-parent feature *should* give you a clearer idea about the commits originally committed directly on the feature branch
[12:15:47] <igemnace> the merge from master should appear as a single merge commit
[12:16:16] <j416> igemnace: git log --first-parent your branch  # perhaps you can find the branch point here?
[12:16:21] <lpapp> all I know is if I run the above commands, I see commits from our branch, commits from main, commits from our branch, etc.
[12:16:28] <lpapp> it is a mess now to review what has been done in our branch
[12:16:34] <furrymcgee> git log --merges
[12:17:21] <igemnace> lpapp: even git log --first-parent feature? there ought to be just one merge commit as the first parent there
[12:17:41] <lpapp> looks like git log --first-parent feature works
[12:17:47] <bookworm> you should simply be able to exclude commits on master them, after all master doesn't contain feature in that case
[12:17:52] <lpapp> igemnace: yes, just wrote the same, that one worked.

[12:19:50] <j416> (git log --no-merges master..feature)

[12:21:57] <lpapp> ready to move on
[12:21:59] <lpapp> thanks!
[12:23:31] <lpapp> git merge is a mess by the way :)
[12:24:31] <igemnace> in a workflow that makes heavy use of rebase, yes it could be
[12:24:47] <lpapp> Some people are overzealous about not rebasing in a shared branch
[12:24:59] <lpapp> even if it is just 2-3 developers
[12:25:05] <lpapp> each could easily run git pull --rebase
[12:25:17] <lpapp> "But rebase in a shared branch is evil!" :)
[12:25:34] <furrymcgee> sharing branches is evil
[12:25:35] <igemnace> "___ is evil" statements are evil
[12:25:55] <lpapp> sure, we should all work alone
[12:25:57] <lpapp> on our projects
[12:26:00] <lpapp> no collaboration!
[12:26:42] <furrymcgee> yes at least for merging
[12:26:43] <lpapp> no more main, only non-shared branches... obviously not, shared branches are fine, but being paranoid about rebases even in case a simple share can cause issues like I have just faced.
[12:26:59] <lpapp> furrymcgee: that is not practical
[12:27:09] <lpapp> imagine a big feature into a project on which multiple devs work
[12:27:16] <lpapp> they do need a long-lived branch in that case.
[12:27:34] <lpapp> (this is the situation I am in)
[12:27:50] <igemnace> really, the mistake here was using something that the team did not agree on. merge, rebase, etc all have their uses and can all play a part in whatever workflow people choose, as long as they agree on it
[12:28:01] <lpapp> but I agree, if it is something tiny, sure, just merge your work to main directly.
[12:28:09] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[12:28:28] <lpapp> we agreed on merge, but I did not know it would mess up the history this critically.
[12:28:35] <lpapp> I am not sure I agree to it next time.
[12:28:51] <lpapp> but maybe, I will get used to --first-parent
[12:28:53] <bookworm> It didn't mess up the history
[12:29:03] <lpapp> oh, yes it did
[12:29:04] <bookworm> it simply introduced a merge commit
[12:29:07] <lpapp> I had to come here for help.
[12:29:09] <igemnace> it" messes" up "git log" if you expect it to be linear, which is typical in rebase-heavy workflows
[12:29:11] <bookworm> so?
[12:29:14] <lpapp> to get the sane branch history back.
[12:29:36] <bookworm> only because you didn't understand it doesn't make it broken
[12:29:39] <igemnace> from a certain point of view, rebase is the one the "messes up" history, while merge retains the graph structure
[12:29:42] <lpapp> is there a way to configure --first-parent in git config?
[12:29:51] <lpapp> so that I do not have to remember it every time
[12:29:55] <bookworm> use an alias
[12:29:57] <igemnace> you *can* make an alias

[12:30:21] <lpapp> you can make an alias, but really, that is not what you do for git pull --rebase
[12:30:31] <furrymcgee> merge into branches rebase onto master
[12:30:33] <lpapp> you can just configure it in the git config, so still interested in that existing approach.

[12:31:19] <bookworm> aliases *are* configured in the git config ;P
[12:31:27] <lpapp> no, you do not get it
[12:31:34] <lpapp> let me find you the existing approach for this:
[12:31:40] <igemnace> that doesn't always apply for every commandline flag. just the ones that were explicitly made to be configurable. perhaps it's in git help config somewhere
[12:32:11] <bookworm> rebase is a flag to be set as a default strategy, I get what you are saying
[12:32:30] <bookworm> however log does many things and I don't think it has toggles like that
[12:32:49] <lpapp> right, so I would personally want the log strategy to be "first parent"
[12:32:50] <bookworm> same it also doesn't have toggles to make it pretty by default afaik
[12:33:01] <lpapp> shame, but thanks!
[12:33:10] <bookworm> so the way most people do it is alias their preferred log thing
[12:33:33] <bookworm> mine is git h / git hf... fully decorated, graph, oneline
[12:33:34] <lpapp> Just a few useful examples: git config [--global] pull.rebase true | git config [--global] rebase.autoStash true | git config [--global] merge.ff false
[12:33:46] <bookworm> sure
[12:35:29] <osse> I'd check if you have pairs of commits with identical commit messages
[12:35:46] <osse> it sort of sounds that way based on which commands worked and which didn't
[12:36:05] <lpapp> I could not spot anything like that.
[12:36:33] <osse> that's good
[12:36:34] <lpapp> but thanks for the hint!
[12:36:50] <lpapp> will keep it mind and get back to you if I spot anything like that down the line.
[12:37:11] <lpapp> osse: by the way, in this non-linear branch history now, does --keep-base still make a difference?

[14:55:25] <lpapp> when gitlab merges a change, it deletes the source branch for us. However, it stays around locally. Do you use some git command to automatically garbage collect local branches that were merged into the destination remotely as opposed to always manually deleting them one-by-one?
[14:55:36] <lpapp> I guess the logic would be something like whatever is there locally, but not remotely, delete?
[14:55:59] <lpapp> although, local work could be lost with this approach, but not sure if there is a safer garbage collection approach.

[15:33:23] <lpapp> if that is the case, would it help if I was rebasing locally and then force push to the MR rather than rebasing via the gitlab ui?

[16:50:06] <bn_work> hi, git 2.24.3, our project recently reorganized our branches, ex: develop -> develop/123/foo , normally I am in develop.  Is it sufficient to just do a `git pull` followed by a `git remote prune origin` to get these updated?  (I ask as the new branches which showed up during the `git pull` don't show up when I do `git branch`)  What gives?

[16:52:15] <Ram-Z> osse: Mainly I was surprised to see the current behaviour. When I read the docs that it would create $(basename <path>) I expected that to work like `git checkout <branch>` and it would use the corresponding remote if it exists.
[16:52:41] <Ram-Z> Now it just creates a local branch with the same name that's totally unrelated to the remote branch.
[16:52:48] <bn_work> do I need to manually setup a new remote tracking branch?

[17:37:52] <osse> because of files and folders and such
[17:38:01] <osse> yep, the branch named develop needs to go

[17:38:45] <bn_work> I thought prune did that yesterday?

[17:39:08] <bn_work> yes
[17:39:17] <osse> prune won't remove that
[17:40:57] <bn_work> so prune only removes the local "read-only" orgin/* branches?

[17:41:25] <bn_work> the message I got yesterday after git pull was:  `error: some local refs could not be updated; try running 'git remote prune origin' to remove any old, conflicting branches`

[17:43:13] <bn_work> for my case
[17:44:14] <osse> the fact that you have a a branch named develop wouldn't have caused a problem for git pull.

[22:53:34] <Helmholtz> I forked a repo. Did some commits and pushed and submitted PRs. Those were accepeted but in the meantime there were other commits to master so my fork got behind. I did add the original repo as `upstream` and `git fetch upstream` then `git pull upstream master`
[22:53:48] <Helmholtz> This caused conflicts. I merged upstream version of things.
[22:54:18] <Helmholtz> Now I have one more commit like `Merge branch master of git`. Is this normal?
[22:54:43] <Helmholtz> I mean my fork is now "ahead" of upstream and also has a bogus commit like that

[22:56:00] <imMute> which 'git pull' would have made if the local branch and upstream/master had diverged
[22:56:33] <Helmholtz> imMute, is this normal?
[22:56:55] <Helmholtz> `This branch is 6 commits ahead of adksakd:master.`
[22:57:10] <imMute> yes - that's what happens when you commit before you push
[22:57:14] <Helmholtz> I thought forks should always be completely mirroed
[22:57:18] <imMute> it just means you have commits that you havn't pushed yet
[22:57:40] <Helmholtz> I think I should force pull now
[22:57:42] <imMute> remember there are three repos involved here - the original on github, your fork on github, and your local clone (of your fork)
[22:58:14] <imMute> and I don't know about github, but I wouldn't be surprised if forks are left as they wwere when created unless you do something to keep them in sync with the source repo

The remote is an upstream source I'm trying to package, so I want it on a specific branch up to a certain tag. Can I get the branch to a working state at that commit? When I just checkout the tag on that branch I'm in a detached HEAD
[23:28:51] <ikke> Guest378: I'm missing an actual question
[23:29:33] <ikke> noarb-: is there a reason why that is an issue?
[23:29:45] <ikke> A branch points to a single commit
[23:30:15] <ikke> From git points of view, checking out a branch to a tag does not really make sense
[23:30:51] <ikke> (you can reset the branch to a tag, but that would discard everything following that tag from that branch)

[23:32:26] <Guest378> i want to work on a project (containing just one file, a shell script) on the fly via a live boot OS, and then save the repository, without having to log in on github.com to reupload the file
[23:33:06] <ikke> well, you need to authenticate somehow to github
[23:33:16] <ikke> either through an ssh key, or through an application token
[23:34:12] <Guest378> how about just enter credentials when asked in the terminal

[23:34:37] <ikke> afaik, github does not allow that anymore

[23:36:38] <Guest378> i tryed on a live boot today, it says everything is up to date, but the file is still just the old one.
[23:36:44] <Guest378> when i clone it again after
[23:37:38] <ikke> did you commit the change?
[23:39:02] <Guest378> i nano'ed the file, made changes, and saved it
[23:39:17] <Guest378> and then tried to push
[23:39:25] <ikke> Then you forget to commit the file
[23:39:28] <ikke> git status
[23:39:42] <ikke> (git is not a file sync program)
[23:40:46] <Guest378> git commit -a is add a file, right?
[23:40:54] <dodo> Guest378: no
[23:41:27] <Guest378> why can i then say "git add or git commit -a"
[23:42:01] <Guest378> git status last line was
[23:42:02] <dodo> -a is for --all
[23:42:02] <Guest378> no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
[23:42:10] <dodo> it's not only for one file
[23:42:37] <Guest378> so i can't use the command git commit to update the one file?
[23:42:42] <dtminus> Guest378: Try git add -p

[23:49:16] <Guest378> so now i can push?
[23:50:21] <ikke> what does git status say?
[23:52:18] <Guest378> it lists: changes to be committed

[23:54:08] <dtminus> Guest378: then you still need to commit, add only stages the changes
[23:54:11] *** Quits: TP1 (~TP1@87.101.193.195) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:56:20] <Guest378> and i commit with the command git command, which tells me "tell me who you are", cant i just enter credentials?
[23:57:25] <imMute> Guest378: that one is configuring the user.name and user.email config options, which are just recorded in the commit.  it's not the authentication credentials for github.
[23:57:39] <dtminus> Try generating a ssh key and adding that to github
[23:59:10] <Guest378> but idd have to log in to github.com and get the ssh and make the live system trusted?
[23:59:22] <Guest378> to upload via cli?
