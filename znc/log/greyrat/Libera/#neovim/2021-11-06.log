[00:02:54] <meatballs> My 2012 MBA is still going strong. It may quite possibly outlast me. 
[00:04:27] <meatballs> I pretty much only use a terminal and a browser on it, so it copes just fine. (thanks, neovim)! 
[00:05:32] <mh72[m]> I kind of miss the customization I had on my laptop with Fedora on it the past years, particularly window management, but with the new M1 provides quadruple battery life and such stability that I haven't rebooted for a week now 
[00:05:42] <mh72[m]> and no more Dell technicians coming by to fix the touchpad
[00:06:46] <meatballs> Even on my desktop Ubuntu machine, I have an apple track pad. That's one thing they definitely got right.

[00:08:23] <meatballs> (says the old fart for whom ten mins mouse usage leads to serious groans of wrist and shoulder based pain) 
[00:10:12] <meatballs> But then, I did start using computers when a terminal was an actual thing rather than a software emulation. Who needs this 'mouse' contraption anyway?!

[00:13:08] <mh72[m]> I also got some bad pain, went all in with exwm (emacs as window manager) to reduce mouse usage as much as possible, that helped quite a bit 
[00:13:21] <mh72[m]> It's the one thing that I really miss on my M1
[00:13:48] <mh72[m]> trying to replicate a lot with Hammerspoon now but it's not the same unfortunately

[00:34:37] <jcbjoe2021> YorickPeterse[m]: something like that let’s say I have a sentence like Now I want to go eat my cursor is on Now and i have to press w to go through each word. How do I jump to say to how would I do that?
[00:35:16] <xaltsc> Hey, are there GUIs for neovim already written for a better prose (with LaTeX and/or markdown with math) UI ?
[00:36:02] <YorickPeterse[m]> jcbjoe2021: Two options come to mind: You can use `/` / `?` then search for the word, or use a plugin like https://github.com/phaazon/hop.nvim
[00:36:57] <YorickPeterse[m]> I do have to admit that I only use hop rarely. Instead I generally do something like `5j, $, b`
[00:37:32] <jcbjoe2021> YorickPeterse[m]: Ok will look into it
[00:37:38] <YorickPeterse[m]> hop is something I tend to use if whatever I want to jump to is in the middle of something, and there isn't a clear symbol I can jump to first (e.g. using `f`)

[00:41:47] <dirkson> Hey all. I'm working with languages that are picky about tabs/spaces. I've got nvim adding spaces instead of tabs when I press 'tab' to indent. But I'd like my left/right movement keys to move over the extra leading spaces as though they were tabs. Is there a way to do that?

[00:48:02] <Bowuigi[m]> Set shiftwidth and tabstop to the same number, also expandtab to get spaces
[00:48:13] <Bowuigi[m]> There was probably another setting that did this lemme check
[00:51:31] <dirkson> Bowuigi[m]: ":set tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 softtabstop=4 expandtab" results in the tab key, delete, and backspace keys behaving how you might expect. Shifting left/right still moves the cursor by 1/4th of an indent though, which annoys me.

[01:35:54] <jaawerth[m]> <neovim[m]1> "wait what’s the issue you’re..." <- Not a huge deal, but I've got an HDMI hub/monitor and if I leave the work macbook plugged into either it will randomly decide to go into a sleep-wake cycle loop and "bloop" at me until I do something about it, lol
[01:36:20] <sunjonSenghanBri> I want to either run that as an external script, or, through chansend to write the OSC query bytes
[01:36:36] <jaawerth[m]> It's probably fixable but a cursory search came back empty and I haven't felt like delving in when I can just remember to unplug instead. Plus, everyone always says macos has the best UX, should I really have to for something fundamental like that? lol
[01:36:46] <sunjonSenghanBri> neither work as it's some weirdness about connecting to a different TTY/PTY
[01:37:40] <jaawerth[m]> from nvim you mean?
[01:37:50] <jaawerth[m]> I played with that a bit and had to execute an external script in order to get the tty handle

[04:13:02] <tk> How do I control when neovim queries the lsp for new diagnostic messages?
[04:13:42] <tk> in c, with clangd, it seems to do it when I exit insert mode
[04:13:52] <tk> in nim, with nimlsp, it seems to do it only when I write the file
[04:15:40] <ii14[m]> there is an option for sending changes in insert mode, but I don't remember what it's called
[04:15:43] <ii14[m]> is that what you want?
[04:16:03] <tk> I don't really mind it only updating after I exit insert mode

[04:25:31] <ii14[m]> yes, all the basics should be the same for both editors
[04:27:27] <jcbjoe2021> i changed the color in .vimrc to delek and i open up vim and it looks ok i guess.. when i type regular text its still white. is this normal? or does only code show diffrent colors?
[04:27:57] <ii14[m]> what do you mean by "regular text"?
[04:28:08] <ii14[m]> like a new plain text file?
[04:28:30] <jcbjoe2021> ii14[m]: yea a plain txt file. .vimrc looks good and has color but regular txt file has no colors
[04:28:49] <ii14[m]> plain text file has no syntax highlighting
[04:28:52] <ii14[m]> since there is no syntax
[04:29:09] <jcbjoe2021> ii14[m]: i turned syntax on in .vimrc dosen't matter right?
[04:30:09] <ii14[m]> turned on how, `:syntax on`?
[04:30:44] <tk> so what would prevent neovim from running diagnostics between :w?
[04:30:46] <jcbjoe2021> ii14[m]: yea :syntax on
[04:30:51] <tk> and why would it only do it on :w
[04:31:33] <ii14[m]> right, plain text files just don't have any highlighting
[04:31:51] <ii14[m]> even with syntax highlighting enabled
[04:32:29] <jcbjoe2021> dam, all i wilil be using vim for is plain text i don't know how to code. oh well vim is till cool. thanks ii14[m] 
[04:33:35] <jcbjoe2021> is knowing how to switch between buffers important or should i just split windows and edit files that way?

[04:37:23] <mjlbach[m]> You can defer displaying the diagnostics with the update_in_insert configuration to vim.diagnostic
[04:37:29] <aphysically> last time I looked in coq it seems not posible but maybe with nvim-cmp
[04:37:43] <mjlbach[m]> aphysically: I think I showed that in kickstart.nvim for nvim-cmp at least

[04:42:02] <mjlbach[m]> Oh
[04:42:03] <mjlbach[m]> sorry
[04:42:07] <mjlbach[m]> I see what you saying
[04:42:15] <mjlbach[m]> no it shouldn't because that's shared across all servers attached to the current buffer
[04:42:35] <blossom[m]> hi ppl
[04:42:40] <mjlbach[m]> I would need to add pruning logic when no more servers are attached
[04:43:03] <ii14[m]> yeah, that's my point. it's probably good for now though
[04:43:15] <mjlbach[m]> I noted this in the comments :) 
[04:43:18] <ii14[m]> however an on_detach callback would be useful
[04:43:40] <mjlbach[m]> There is an on_detach callback
[04:43:44] <mjlbach[m]> it's just internal :) 
[04:44:31] <ii14[m]> I mean on_detach exposed for the user, like on_exit
[04:44:41] <ii14[m]> on_exit works on the entire lsp client
[04:44:44] <mjlbach[m]> what would you use it for?
[04:44:56] <ii14[m]> I set signcolumn always on in on_attach
[04:45:04] <mjlbach[m]> oh interesting
[04:45:10] <ii14[m]> and I'd like to turn it off on detach
[04:45:29] <ii14[m]> you know, so it won't move the code left and right with the diagnostics
[04:46:08] <ii14[m]> also it's a nice indication that the server is attached
[04:46:11] <mjlbach[m]> I think that might be more annoying than you would expect for multiple language servers
[04:46:42] <mjlbach[m]> I'll think about it :) 
[04:47:01] <ii14[m]> I never used multiple servers for one buffer, but I could always check if there are any left

[05:54:05] <dirkson> Hey, just to check before I start writing code that already exists - I want a way to force the cursor to stay outside the leading whitespace/tabs of a line. Press left when there are no non-whitespace characters to the left, the cursor doesn't move. Press down when the cursor would hit leading whitespace and do ^ after the move to jump to the start of the line. Etc. Is anyone aware of something
[05:54:07] <dirkson> similar to this having been already done?

[06:02:43] <dirkson> ii14[m]: Great. That's amazing. I know with absolute certainty it would have taken me at least an hour to start coming up with something like that.
[06:02:59] <ii14[m]> `j` and `k` will be more complicated because of bounds checking
[06:03:13] <ii14[m]> you could do it with CursorMoved event, but that might be a bad idea
[06:03:51] <ii14[m]> some plugins might want to move around unrestricted, so it's best to just redefine mappings

[06:30:28] <ii14[m]> okay, fixed it
[06:31:21] <ii14[m]> what I was talking about was when you go down or up, vim restores your old column when you go over shorter lines
[06:31:58] <dirkson> ii14[m]: Ohhhh, gotcha.
[06:32:20] <dirkson> ii14[m]: Wow, yup. That works flawlessly on my little sample.
[06:32:45] <ii14[m]> <count>h is not working properly, are you using that often?
[06:32:53] <ii14[m]> `2h` etc
[06:33:24] <dirkson> ii14[m]: Personally, I never use count in conjunction with movement. If I'm moving that far I'll just break out /
[06:33:50] <ii14[m]> okay, then that should be good enough
[06:34:42] <dirkson> For my purposes, it's lovely. I've mostly been trying to make space indents behave similarly enough to tab indents to not have to think about it. This improves *both* my tabbed and spaced indent workflow.

[08:07:40] <ii14[m]> if you're programming then yeah, it's useful. for just plaintext ctrl-n/ctrl-p is enough
[08:08:41] <ii14[m]> you just need autocompletion from the buffer or a dictionary, and vim already has that
[08:09:10] <jcbjoe2021> ii14[m]: this plugin is amazing nice just like i saw on youtube. now to map these keys
[08:09:25] <ii14[m]> jcbjoe2021: which plugin?
[08:09:32] <jcbjoe2021> fzf
[08:10:04] <ii14[m]> in your init.vim `nnoremap <leader>f :Files<CR>`
[08:10:25] <jcbjoe2021> ii14[m]: what does that do?
[08:10:31] <ii14[m]> wait, forgot that you have to set your leader key first
[08:10:45] <ii14[m]> this line before everything else: `let g:mapleader = ' '`
[08:10:56] <ii14[m]> this will set the leader key (`<leader>`) to space
[08:11:12] <ii14[m]> nnoremap is defining a normal mode mapping
[08:11:25] <ii14[m]> `<leader>f` mean the sequence of space-F
[08:11:41] <ii14[m]> and `:Files<CR>` what should this sequence be remapped to
[08:11:47] <ii14[m]> `<CR>` is enter
[08:12:33] <ii14[m]> then restart neovim and press space and F
[08:12:37] <jcbjoe2021> ok
[08:14:41] <jcbjoe2021> ii14[m]: so let g:mapleader = ' ' in init.vim before everything. then put nnoremap <leader>f under neath that. restart nvim and run  :Files<CR>  in nvim ?
[08:18:44] <ii14[m]> right
[08:19:11] <ii14[m]> oh wait a second
[08:19:29] <ii14[m]> did you put the fzf inside `call plug#begin()` and `call plug#end()`?
[08:19:42] <ii14[m]> you'll have to run `:PlugUpdate` first to install the plugins
[08:19:45] <jcbjoe2021> ii14[m]: yea im looking at fzf and space f worked

[08:30:26] <ii14[m]> if you want to search over your entire filesystem then `:Files /`
[08:30:30] <jcbjoe2021> ok
[08:30:42] <ii14[m]> you can give it a path to directory
[08:30:51] <ii14[m]> :Files /path/to/directory
[08:31:26] <jcbjoe2021> i like how it previews :D
[08:32:56] <jcbjoe2021> i think vim and nvim are really good if I was a programmer. this plugin is good to find files I need to edit and save

[10:09:09] <old1101> is there any config to `delay` lsp, when opening vim and changing buffers (went from instantaneous to 200-300ms, annoying meh)
[10:12:18] <mjlbach[m]> hmmm?
[10:12:21] <mjlbach[m]> what is 200-300 ms?
[10:15:05] <old1101> with rust (rust-analyzer) and not-the-fastest-machine, running `:buffer #`
[10:16:30] <mjlbach[m]> ah
[10:16:33] <mjlbach[m]> rust is a special case
[10:16:38] <mjlbach[m]> we have to query cargo to get the project root
[10:17:15] <mjlbach[m]> but no lspconfig can currently not be made "async"
[10:17:49] <mjlbach[m]> you can disable autostart and call LspStart to start rust analyzer manually if you want
[10:18:41] <ii14[m]> well, at least it memory safe
[10:19:19] <mjlbach[m]> the issue is more we have to await a semi-blocking call to cargo --metdata, then parse the json to get the root of the project
[10:19:20] <ii14[m]> * least it's memory
[10:19:36] <mjlbach[m]> it's the "real" way of finding project roots, because rust has multicrate projects quite frequently
[10:20:26] <mjlbach[m]> and the way lspconfig works is esentially setup{} maps a filetype autocommand that calls a root directory detection function (which calls cargo, which blocks) -> create a "new config" using the cached settings you passed into setup, and the calls start_client
[10:20:40] <mjlbach[m]> the latter two are basically instant, it's the former that is the issue
[10:22:33] <ii14[m]> can't it be triggered with a slight delay, so at least switching buffers is responsive?
[10:24:00] <ii14[m]> or is it hard to do with the current abstraction
[10:24:12] <mjlbach[m]> triggering it with a slight delay will block at that slight delay
[10:24:27] <mjlbach[m]> also we're talking 200 ms lol

[10:25:07] <ii14[m]> why is it blocking? what is it doing?
[10:25:56] <mjlbach[m]> calling job_start/wait on `cargo metadata --no-deps --format version 1`
[10:26:11] <old1101> mjlbach[m] thanks for the extended explanation, things are making more sense now
[10:26:27] <mjlbach[m]> I will make it async eventually
[10:26:30] <ii14[m]> it's another process, can't it be done asynchronously?
[10:26:38] <ii14[m]> oh okay
[10:26:46] <mjlbach[m]> hypothetically but that would basically involve rewriting the lspconfig start process
[10:26:57] <mjlbach[m]> which is fine, it's not that much code
[10:27:24] <old1101> yeah, I *think* i can live with 200ms, it just feels weird now
[10:27:52] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah, depends on the project/system
[10:27:59] <mjlbach[m]> for me it's more like ~20 with RA

[17:07:16] <kylo252[m]> > Before you can build a C or C++ program on the command line, you must verify that the tools are installed, and that you can access them from the command line. Visual C++ has complex requirements for the command-line environment to find the tools, headers, and libraries it uses. You can't use Visual C++ in a plain command prompt window without some preparation. You need a developer command prompt window, which is a regular command prompt
[17:07:16] <kylo252[m]> window that has all the required environment variables set. **Fortunately**, Visual C++ installs shortcuts for you to launch developer command prompts that have the environment set up for command line builds. **Unfortunately**, the names of the developer command prompt shortcuts and where they're located are different in almost every version of Visual C++ and on different versions of Windows. Your first walkthrough task is to find the right
[17:07:16] <kylo252[m]> shortcut to use.

[19:52:10] <tk> now the only issue is making that work with vcm
[19:53:31] <ii14[m]> might have messed up what option does what, I never understood all the tab options and I just set them all to the same value
[19:53:56] <ii14[m]> what's vcm?
[19:53:59] <tk> vimcompletesme
[19:54:01] <tk> tab completion
[19:54:22] <tk> triggers omnicompletion (or something else) when you press tab in a place where it doesn't make sense to indent
[19:56:59] <ii14[m]> looking at the source code, it's a really simple plugin so you can just copy it over to your config and modify it
[19:57:11] <tk> right, but it didn't work in vim either :P
[19:57:12] <tk> with vcm
[19:57:27] <tk> I don't even know if it worked without vcm
[19:57:29] <tk> it was a hack
[19:57:42] <tk> incidentally, your binding also seems to not work
[19:58:03] <ii14[m]> you need to `set noet`
[19:58:28] <tk> it's already set
[19:58:31] <ii14[m]> to actually enable hard tabs
[19:58:38] <tk> yes, I use hardtabs in all C codebases
[19:58:43] <tk> it's set in the ftplugin
[19:59:42] <ii14[m]> works for me in both nvim and vim
[20:00:24] <tk> if <tab> is already bound to something in insert mode, does that do anything at all?
[20:00:50] <tk> also, will that also fix running auto-indent on a region or file ( = )?
[20:01:24] <ii14[m]> oh right, the plugin probably overrides this mapping
[20:01:42] <tk> the plugin is loaded before this mapping, but I think it might enable the maps later
[20:01:49] <tk> let me move this to ftplugin
[20:02:28] <ii14[m]> you can just paste it to command line
[20:02:31] <ii14[m]> `<c-r>+`
[20:03:14] <tk> ii14[m]: it seems to do something, but only after there's already text on the line
[20:04:05] <ii14[m]> isn't that what you want? hard tabs on the beginning, soft tabs after text?
[20:04:13] <tk> basically, take this hypothetical code ( \ == newline, > == tab ) >puts(\>    "foo");
[20:04:23] <tk> no, I want soft-tabs after tabs which put the indent-level correctly
[20:04:32] <tk> and I want it to work when auto-indenting
[20:05:18] <tk> and I want that without interfering with vcm tab complete
[20:05:27] <ii14[m]> I think you can figure out the correct indentation level with indentexpr
[20:05:52] <tk> indentexpr takes into account cindent options iirc and will give the wrong indent level
[20:06:04] <tk> it will give the adjusted indent level according to the rules
[20:06:21] <tk> i.e. >puts(\
[20:06:39] <tk> at this point it will say to indent 1 tab + 5 spaces
[20:06:48] <tk> because that's how things are configured
[20:07:02] <tk> but if I had a function with a name_longer_than_a_tabstop
[20:07:21] <tk> it would say 4 tabs and 3 spaces
[20:07:31] <tk> and I want 1 tab and 8 * 3 + 3 spaces
[20:09:21] <tk> as an aside, is there some documentation on how to translate vimscript to lua?
[20:09:39] <tk> do I just type :help for every vim command?
[20:09:42] <clason[m]> !guide
[20:09:47] <nvim-bot[m]> https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide
[20:09:52] <ii14[m]> okay I'm not sure if I understand everything correctly, but either way it sounds like the solution would be more complicated than what I'd be able to come up with on the spot
[20:09:55] <clason[m]> not every vim command has a Lua equivalent

[20:10:44] <tk> ii14[m]: yes, I don't think it's a simple answer
[20:11:22] <tk> for now for the rare cases when it occurs I will do the alignment manually
[20:11:22] <clason[m]> (every Neovim API function has, though)
[20:11:44] <ii14[m]> use a formatter maybe
[20:11:48] <tk> no thanks
[20:12:00] <tk> I would like to maintain control over special cases
[20:12:18] <ii14[m]> I don't like them either tbh
[20:13:24] <tk> I think it would be worth me investigating if gnu indent or whatever the other one is called can do what I ask (for the cases when I've just pasted someone else's code into vim for reading purposes)
[20:13:47] <tk> but I think using an autoformatter to fix hitting enter after a function's ( would make me even less happy :P

[20:37:12] <clason[m]> (I'm not being facetious)
[20:37:17] <jcbjoe2021> ii14[m]: learning as i go. i know the basics. the vimtutor was nice. plus youtube
[20:38:09] <ii14[m]> I'm looking through my plugins and most of it is for programming

[20:39:01] <jcbjoe2021> ok thanks clason[m]

[21:44:14] <gpanders> I just use a non-standard git dir to avoid confusing other tools
[21:44:16] <ii14[m]> and then you can do something like `git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --work-tree=$HOME`
[21:44:23] <gpanders> So instead of .git I call it .dotfiles
[21:44:26] <ndav1d[m]> but I mean it works fine with me https://github.com/ndav1d/dotfiles
[21:44:31] <ndav1d[m]> ohh
[21:44:31] <gpanders> ii14[m]: Yep this is what I do exactly
[21:44:38] <jamessan[m]> I have lots of git repos, all rooted in ~
[21:44:40] <ndav1d[m]> yeah maybe I should do that
[21:44:49] <jamessan[m]> Yay vcsh
[21:45:02] <ii14[m]> I actually use `alias dot='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/.git --work-tree=$HOME'`

[21:45:16] <ndav1d[m]> I didn't even know I could do that
[21:45:16] <ii14[m]> I just have a copy of dotfiles repo in .dotfiles
[21:45:17] <ii14[m]> without bare repo

[21:45:51] <ndav1d[m]> maybe I'll change the .git to .dotfiles
[21:45:59] <ndav1d[m]> or .files hah! ;)
[21:46:30] <gpanders> ii14[m]: I’m even crazier https://github.com/gpanders/dotfiles/blob/master/.local/bin/git
[21:46:58] <gpanders> I’m too lazy to remember to use `dot` in my home dir and `git` everywhere else
[21:47:29] <maverun[m]> dot... i just name my config lol
[21:47:32] <maverun[m]> dot is better i guess
[21:47:57] <tk> :q
[21:48:14] <ii14[m]> gpanders: I'm using this trick of getting rid of yourself from PATH for non xdg compliant programs
[21:48:32] <ii14[m]> or if something doesn't even have a config file
[21:49:28] <ii14[m]> https://github.com/ii14/dotfiles/tree/master/.local/bin/aliases
[21:50:26] <tk> you could totally make a function called git which works out what the current .git file is and if it's the one you manage your dotfiles with then make it switch to whatever "dot" does
[21:50:27] <jamessan[m]> gpanders: Missing `exec` at the end
[21:50:52] <tk> in my case I just need to pass -f to git add when managing dotfiles so it's not the end of the world
[21:51:06] <gpanders> jamessan[m]: You’re right, ty

[21:53:48] <ii14[m]> finds the git binary and checks cwd
[21:54:09] <ii14[m]> changes git-dir based on that
[21:54:11] <gpanders> If I’m in my home dir, use `.dotfiles` as the git dir, otherwise just use `.git` as usual
[21:54:29] <gpanders> Basically it just makes the `git` command work differently if I’m in my home directory
[21:54:41] <dundargoc[m]> 🧠
[21:54:58] <maverun[m]> .dotfiles? 🤔
[21:55:38] <dundargoc[m]> gpanders: I will let you off the hook because I respect you too much, but you're on thin ice buddy.
[21:55:40] <maverun[m]> similar as ii14 way but with use of git only i assume?

[21:56:41] <maverun[m]> oh oh i see i understand.. (more i look at script)
[21:57:15] <maverun[m]> maybe i should try this
[21:59:38] <ii14[m]> forgot to explain why I *don't* use a bare repo. I pull changes to .dotfiles first with just `git pull` and then with `dot` command I "merge" files from .dotfiles to my actual home directory. not all machines are the same, so I sometimes skip changes to certain files
[21:59:56] <ii14[m]> I don't think git has a way of doing that just as a single repo
[21:59:58] <maverun[m]> i just do bare repo cuz its simple and does what i damn want to lol
[22:00:04] <ii14[m]> if you merge, you merge everything afaik
[22:00:06] <maverun[m]> well i mean it just work.

[22:07:53] <kevr> Hey guys. So, I know this isn't particularly a neovim question, but I can't really figure out where the lsp community is for asyncomplete. I'm using asyncomplete[-lsp].vim with pylsp (python language server), and i've got a bit of a quirk with my function docstring popups: https://p.haavard.me/5r.png

[22:27:33] <tk> does anyone know what I may have seen?
[22:28:07] <tk> because when I search "neovim org mode" all I get is entries for an org-mode syntax highlighter or stuff like that, but I remember this was similar but different from org mode
