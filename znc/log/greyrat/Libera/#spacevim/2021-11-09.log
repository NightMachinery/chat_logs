[17:09:21] <SpaceVimBot> <happyhessian> nm upgraded to the latest appimage release and it works
[17:23:56] <SpaceVimBot> <onlyphantom> In [this part of the documentation] (https://spacevim.org/layers/lang/markdown/), it says: 
[17:23:58] <SpaceVimBot> <onlyphantom> 
[17:23:59] <SpaceVimBot> <onlyphantom> > To use Prettier, you need to change the layer option: `enabled_formater`.
[17:24:00] <SpaceVimBot> <onlyphantom> 
[17:24:01] <SpaceVimBot> <onlyphantom> Would you consider `formater` to be a typo, of the actual word `formatter` or was it intended?
[17:25:23] <SpaceVimBot> <onlyphantom> Thank you Shidong, and all SpaceVim developers / contributors for this great tool + ecosystem
[18:45:06] <SpaceVimBot> <anpok> yeah it is awesome!
