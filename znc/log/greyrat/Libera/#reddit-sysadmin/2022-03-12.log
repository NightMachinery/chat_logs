[00:00:19] <bomb> DrGibby I don't think low carb is diet healthy that much. I read an article recently about it https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/news/20180828/low-carb-diet-may-up-odds-for-an-early-death

[00:03:16] <CableNinja> PublicWifi, iirc the super old OWA page was like that, it had a long char limit, but would hack off some chars as the password when you set it, but wouldnt when you tried to login
[00:04:42] <nx032> bomb, thank goodness im on a low carb diet
[00:05:21] <PublicWifi> CableNinja: just awful
[00:05:59] <bomb> nx032 yeah man I try to keep half of my calories coming from carbs, just like that article states. heart shit is no joke
[00:06:10] <nx032> CableNinja, we have a program here like that, wont let you set a password longer than 8 chars but if you paste it in it works just fine

[00:06:26] <CableNinja> lol thats ridiculous

[00:07:07] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> lol
[00:07:19] <bomb> cooleb09 well, goal is calorie deficit. I've been trying intermittent fasting thingie lately :)

[00:07:39] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> intermitten fasting or OMAD works well
[00:07:54] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> I found that if i elt myself have a anskac or anything i'd jsut not stop eating : (
[00:08:03] <nx032> i modified the keto diet to fit my need, i just cut out sugar and most carbs, i eat carb low or free bread/wraps and stick to minimal fruit but higher veggie intake
[00:08:04] <bomb> yeah. switched to 48-hour thing after about a month of OMAD
[00:08:19] <vinrock> s/O/U
[00:08:19] <layer8> bomb meant: "yeah. switched to 48-hour thing after about a month of UMAD"

[00:08:50] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> I amnaged to get myself down to 51 Kg and was looking pretty good, but then jsut ran out of energy/effort/mindspace/care for anything and just kinda flel over and got fat again : (
[00:08:53] <nx032> i replaced rice for buckwheat/quinoa mix
[00:09:24] <nx032> for me low calorie diets were horrible, you never have enough energy or youre always hungry and the food you do eat doesnt satisfy
[00:09:48] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> @bomb cooking 1/4 a cup of couscous and mixing in some raisins or fresh (iw as growing it at the time) parsely is a erally nice and light dinner
[00:10:06] <bomb> nx032 man, I hear ya. I've tried this over years many times, this time I managed to go a month. my trick is: olive and sesame oil
[00:10:21] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> also if you shop aorund, some of the tin soups can be really 'hearty' and wamr but are only like 200 cals for a meal
[00:10:43] <nx032> yeah good oils add nice heartness to food that makes it more palatable 
[00:10:48] <nx032> heartyness*
[00:10:59] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> yeah, but oil/fats are jsut straigh excess cals
[00:11:10] <bomb> finishing my eating period with like 50-100g of sesame oil 'prepares' the body for fat burning
[00:11:10] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> we tryin to get T H I N here or what?
[00:11:32] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> lol what do you mena 'prepares for fat burning '
[00:11:43] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> it jsut does that
[00:11:56] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> you burn like 2000 cals just by existing
[00:11:59] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> each day
[00:12:05] <bomb> nah. body finishes glucose and carbs first, then switches to fat
[00:12:26] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> well, yeah, uses sugar/blood sugars before metabolising fat
[00:12:36] <nx032> i live near the disney/universal theme parks as well so ill walk 8-15 miles in a day on the weekends plus regular walking with my dogs. Wish i could go back to kayaking and bike riding but my gf aint bout that life
[00:12:40] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> but if you eat 1K carloies a day you will burn both regardless
[00:12:53] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> with no other exercise
[00:13:06] <bomb> yeah, oiling the fuel tank makes that transition less painful to me
[00:13:12] <nx032> unfortunately lately my fat ass has been going home and having no time to do anything so my weight has been going up
[00:13:41] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> exercise has minimal impact on cals burned for most people/unless you re suuper into it
[00:13:47] <bomb> that's for sure. calorie deficit works. but you can't really eat 1k calories of corn syrup, and then expect a steady transition to fat burning.

[01:11:26] <monr0e> Back in the glory days of Windows XP, I had an update that changed how storage access queues were organised. I had a shitty no-name brand PC at the time, and the change caused a physical short, which nuked the HDD *and* the controller. I found one singular forum post from a buy in Brazil with the same motherboard as myself, documenting exactly how the update fucked me. Only I found it after buying three new drives, which at the time 
[01:11:27] <monr0e> were *not* cheap, especially on a 14 year old's pocket money. I was disgruntled to say the least.

[01:21:06] <monr0e> if you want to learn about stuff that you'll use, create yourself a little domain and add your network devices to it. Now you can practise using policies and administrative templates.
[01:21:13] <sd> 06<Pâ€‹hasey> DrGibby yeah idk what i was talking about

[01:23:43] <sd> 04<Fâ€‹eralTerminator> One of these day's I'm going to switch full time
[01:23:52] <monr0e> Well, creating a domain and implementing active directory on your network is where you'lllearn that. Although bear in mind, it might be useful to have a throwaway laptop or a temporary VM to add to your domain rahte rthan your daily PC
[01:24:20] <sd> 04<Fâ€‹eralTerminator> I'd switch this office pc over but it's having issues with having a second monitor hooked up to this AIO

[01:25:46] <monr0e> As for linux, the easiest way to earn is, surprisingly, to jump in at the deep end. Go look at the arch installation wallkthrough, and install arch. Install a display manager, and then a desktop environment. Then format it and move to a better daily distro, like Fedora. That should give you a brief understanding of how bash works, how permissions work, the structure of the kernel, etc etc
[01:25:59] * monr0e prepares for the barrage of "I disagree!"
[01:26:09] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> I 100% agree

[01:26:28] <monr0e> But don't use arch as a daily
[01:26:33] <monr0e> I made that mistake once. Once.
[01:26:45] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> the ionly downside is that delaing with the dbeian/apt world or anyuone who thinkgs DM = distro will frustrate you for all etnerity
[01:26:55] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> I sued arch as a daily all through Uni

[01:27:56] <monr0e> Its good, but if you're nto familiar with it, the slightest issue can seem like an irrepairable problem. There are lots more distros out there that are ore forgiving

[04:39:59] <DoTheNeedful> Quote #634 (U:2/D:-1): <rpifan> with azure you need an up detector lol  [submitted by DrGibby on 2022-03-08 13:33:24 CST]
[04:42:22] <DrGibby> !flyfact
[04:42:22] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Ever wondered why itâ€™s so difficult to swat a fly? Well, itâ€™s pretty much down to their quick reaction times and their agility. House flies are able to process what they see and react accordingly at amazing speeds. To put things into perspective, our brains process around 60 images a second, whereas a fly can process around 250 in a single second.
[04:45:48] <mistiry> Super interesting!
[04:45:50] <mistiry> !flyfact
[04:45:50] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: House flies defecateâ€¦ a lot! And they arenâ€™t too worried about where they do it either! As you know, house flies like to live off a liquid diet. Because of this, their digestive system can move quite quickly, which means they defecate often. It is speculated that house flies defecate every time they land, even if itâ€™s on their next meal!

[11:06:13] <JollyRgrs> skype... that's a platform i only ever used as Skype for Business... I've used Skype (personal)... twice? (i was forced to use it by the other party)

[11:19:53] <sd> 03<sâ€‹poo> i'm pretty sure discord has a rate limit for webhooks, and these multiline ascii art isn't giving it a nice time
[11:19:55] <sd> 03<sâ€‹poo> yeah
[11:20:23] <PattyCakes> here's my question though, was that a retarded discord mod or a DrGibby giving me the overnight special
[11:20:37] <PattyCakes> but I do have a love for trolling discord mods
[11:20:50] <sd> 03<sâ€‹poo> huh, did something happen?

[13:13:38] <kerat58> done right, and done when it is needed

[13:14:19] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> thats a good decision
[13:14:22] <PattyCakes> the cost savings, the time savings, and the workflow improvements are amazing
[13:14:28] <sd> 08<câ€‹ray.io> i feel like theres a "when all you have is an X then everything looks like a Y" joke here but i dont know k8s or k3s

[13:14:47] <PattyCakes> and the ROI is measured in decades, not years
[13:14:57] <PattyCakes> well maybe not decades, but multiple years
[13:15:01] <kerat58> i got away with using AWS Fargate to bypass neeidng K8s for a particular computation heavy workload one time
[13:15:31] <kerat58> but it was a lucky workload where requests could be distributed amongst a homogenous pool of Docker workers

[13:16:34] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> you got it round the right way
[13:16:48] <kerat58> so what i did was use Ansible playbooks to semi-automatically manage Docker processes
[13:16:59] <PattyCakes> so much hate kerat58 
[13:17:14] <PattyCakes> I can't explain the hate
[13:17:17] <PattyCakes> but it's a large amount of hate
[13:17:32] <kerat58> e.g., deploy home web server in a Docker container.....OK, generate a config template using templating; bind the template to a volume; and fire up a docker contianer.  Attach container to network.  There's ansible plays for all this
[13:17:39] <PattyCakes> just let AWS manage all the things.
[13:17:42] <PattyCakes> it's easy
[13:17:44] <PattyCakes> you cut them a check
[13:17:46] <PattyCakes> they do things
[13:17:55] <kerat58> PattyCakes exactly 
[13:17:58] * PattyCakes closes ticket, and bills 40 hours
[13:18:00] <kerat58> we do use k8s for specific workloads though
[13:18:13] <kerat58> but they are apps that were bulit with that in mind since day 1
[13:18:15] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> @kerat whats the min on prem stuff to get ansible doing some config management/updates/deployments?

[13:18:30] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> I dipped my toes into salt once
[13:18:34] <PattyCakes> ansible is push, all you need is SSH and Git
[13:19:02] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> ok, but I need some kind of central server to do the pushing and the managem,ent
[13:19:07] <kerat58> cooleb09:  I have a low-spec Linux desktop rig to run the actual Ansible playbooks.  ALl Ansible does is connect via SSH to the 'targets' and runs commands
[13:19:14] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> yeah
[13:19:15] <kerat58> it is basically like running bash scripts

[13:19:23] <PattyCakes> you can expand from there, and use things like Tower or other "pull" mechnisms but at its default core, it's a push system and you just need SSH

[13:20:05] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> push is fine
[13:20:27] <kerat58> yeah, so, unless you set up a cron job to re-run the "playbook" or something, the ansible stuff isn't happening unless someone sits at the PC and says to run those playbooks

[13:28:05] <PattyCakes> cause you get paid to deal with this
[13:28:07] <PattyCakes> deal with it
[13:28:07] <kerat58> yes, well, deploying to a known state -- or stateful architecture in a general -- is a big thing
[13:28:08] <PattyCakes> :P
[13:28:15] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> yeah
[13:28:20] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> IaC is a thing
[13:28:27] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> CI/CD and config managemtn is a thing
[13:28:40] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> but it feels like I'd need 3 times as much infras to do that
[13:28:43] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> for these 3 boxes
[13:28:43] <kerat58> Something based around a thick VM that was setup by hand, isn't stateful in a realistic/modern view, eveni f you have backups where you culd "roll back the VM to some other state"
[13:28:49] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> as i do to supprot the company operationaly
[13:28:53] <kerat58> because you can't deploy 10 of those automatically for example

[13:29:00] <PattyCakes> AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes
[13:29:02] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> so i want tog et to that point
[13:29:10] <kerat58> cooleb09:  here's another thing to consider
[13:29:14] <PattyCakes> name 3 other thigns that'll make you 200k/year
[13:29:18] <PattyCakes> oh cassandra and kafka
[13:29:22] <PattyCakes> that'll do it too
[13:29:32] <kerat58> the number of VMs is a topic you've touched on a lot
[13:29:37] <CombatVet> "Your free trial includes $300 in credit to spend over the next 90 days." (GCP)
[13:29:40] <CombatVet> well...
[13:29:50] <kerat58> you might want to look into the cost for 'that number of nodes' on the cloud, and just ask your superiors what they think
[13:29:50] <CombatVet> how useless is this $300 credit
[13:30:14] <kerat58> because what you and I think is an outrageous number of VMs, cost-wise might be nothing to the company who just wants things to work
[13:30:16] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> @kerat I genuinly don't see how a cloud solution helps wiht an on prem mail relay or reverse proxy server
[13:30:26] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> I knwo what you're saying
[13:30:32] <kerat58> yes, well, on-prem servres then :)

[13:30:57] <kerat58> if you need hardware to support 10 VMs, that cost might not really be as "outrageous" as we think
[13:31:11] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> I've cut 100k on IT POs in the last 2 months
[13:31:25] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> I ahve the funding and harwae to run shitlaods of VMs
[13:31:33] <CombatVet> PattyCakes, i'm willing to pay, wasn't expecting this free shit, what happens when it expires? delete your shit? lul
[13:31:48] <PattyCakes> well they won't do it for you
[13:31:52] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> but more, it jsut gets a bit silly
[13:31:56] <PattyCakes> but yes, if you don't wanna pay, you gotta delete your shit :P
[13:32:21] <PattyCakes> but if you don't care abotu charges, or it's work or whatever, that credit is what it says
[13:32:35] <CombatVet> right
[13:32:37] <PattyCakes> you can spend up to $300 on GCP resources and not be charged a dime 
[13:32:55] <koollman> cooleb09: to get ansible working, the minimum is basically 'the vm you want to manage'. 
[13:33:01] <PattyCakes> if you build a top tier VM with a quadro in it that costs $12/minute
[13:33:04] <koollman> you can add more stuff later but don't have to
[13:33:14] <PattyCakes> well that $300 goes away fast
[13:33:17] <CombatVet> lol
[13:33:22] <PattyCakes> if you build a tiny data bucket that costs .00000001c/month

[13:33:26] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> I realised at one point that nearly half of what I run doesn't help the business it just all helping to run the other IT overhead

[13:33:43] <kerat58> cooleb09:  Don't think that way, man.
[13:34:05] <kerat58> The plumbing (e.g., the IT that just supports other IT) is still needed in order to support the rest of the business
[13:34:16] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> true
[13:34:39] <kerat58> Electricity might not "help the business" either
[13:34:46] <kerat58> but turn that shit off and let's see how much work gets done tomorrow
[13:35:19] <PattyCakes> Your goal should be to support the business in anyway you have the skills for - so they can keep making money and keep paying you
[13:35:35] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> yes
[13:35:47] <kerat58> a lot of business-educated people will try to diminish the importance of IT people by making 'observations' like that (about how the infrastrucutre is only internal etc)
[13:35:50] <PattyCakes> is fixing the coffee maker in my job description? no.... Can I plug it in because stupid people are stupid?
[13:35:51] <PattyCakes> yes
[13:35:57] <koollman> cooleb09: helping IT overhead helps the business. Although it is sometimes hard to decide what is worth it
[13:36:14] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> agreed koolman
[13:36:35] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> esp since now the business and I have... come to a different udnertsnding and there's more funding available
[13:36:38] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> I answer to 2 directors
[13:36:49] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> the one who normally apporved my budget was very... cost advserse
[13:37:06] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> the other one is much more number and risk/reward/capability/cost etc
[13:37:07] <koollman> but, in general, most things that save human time or help other be more productive, can be reasonably cost effective even if the direct cost seems high
[13:37:13] <PattyCakes> was a raise factored into your budgetÂ¿
[13:37:35] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> I got one in december
[13:37:45] <PattyCakes> alrighty, carry on :)
[13:37:53] <PattyCakes> raises are top lines in my budget
[13:38:00] <kerat58> hahaha
[13:38:03] <kerat58> nic
[13:38:03] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> but now the other director is 'making it rain' capex, its ... more intersting tyrin to find the limt of what the business actualy wants/expects
[13:38:03] <kerat58> nice
[13:38:04] <koollman> (also things that help get more customers, or help keep those customers. including anything that is required or highly suggested by policies/laws)
[13:38:06] <PattyCakes> if those don't get approved, nothign else does
[13:38:24] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> thats the thing, most of this stuff doesn't help that
[13:38:33] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> we can get away with limping on near nothing pretty well
[13:38:40] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> direact A made sure of that
[13:38:52] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> but jsut because it was limping, doesn't mean it was working/fit for purpose
[13:39:14] <PattyCakes> if you and you're team are getting paid to a level that makes ya'll "happy" and the business doesn't want to put more money into your group for things you tell them you need
[13:39:15] <PattyCakes> well at the end of the day, you're not the bnoss, and it's not your money
[13:39:24] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> agreed
[13:39:25] <PattyCakes> kinda just gotta go with it, make it work, or make a move
[13:39:33] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> and thats where i was
[13:39:39] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> now directoir B is making it rain capex
[13:39:47] <PattyCakes> at the end of the day, all that matters is YOUR paycheck
[13:39:51] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> and jsut... redadjussting internally
[13:39:52] <koollman> câ€‹ooleb09: yeah, but for example, being able to quickly restore after a problem, or to diagnose thing quickly and fix a problem, helps a lot. But that means managing complexity and avoiding too much stuff managed by humans (worse, known by only one human :) )
[13:40:12] <PattyCakes> if you get what you need personally, then I'd say ride the money wave until it comes crashing down
[13:40:18] <PattyCakes> and always keep that ressuma updated
[13:40:22] <PattyCakes> and a CYA letter on hand
[13:40:30] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> @koolman exacttly
[13:40:38] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> also ive been beggin for a 2nd human for months
[13:40:47] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> but... tis hard
[13:41:11] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> IT loading here is maybe 0.6-0.75 of an FTE

[13:41:41] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> but at the same time asking for a budget to do my job quicker, when I already am seen as 'having time' is ... difficult
[13:41:58] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> i.e why should we buy intune/autopilot, just setup evrything yourself
[13:42:03] <koollman> one of my metric when doing this kind of stuff is "assume I'm barely awake after a night of booze and stuff is broken. How long would I need to make stuff work again". That's the interruption time that may cost the company a lot, so  ... reducing that helps :)
[13:42:07] <PattyCakes> That's kinda on you. That's kinda your job
[13:42:09] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> why buy AADP1 for passwrod reset, ahve them call your eprsonal number
[13:42:13] <PattyCakes> you need to provide and articulate a business case
[13:42:17] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> yes
[13:42:51] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> the problem wiht that patty is that 'being a hack is free' (whast technical debt?!)
[13:42:53] <kerat58> this unfortunately is the type of bullshit that happens with "small businessS"
[13:43:00] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> yes
[13:43:02] <kerat58> "we're all family" so everyone has your personal cell
[13:43:04] <PattyCakes> I've put many hours into business research to support my case - only to have it tossed in the trash without even being looked at
[13:43:14] <PattyCakes> but again, that's just how it goes sometimes
[13:43:38] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> yup
[13:43:39] <PattyCakes> sometimes it's just time to jump ship
[13:43:45] <kerat58> exactly...
[13:43:47] <PattyCakes> or if the money is stupid good, keep riding
[13:43:51] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> nah, I'm alligne dwiht this palce for other reasons
[13:43:51] <kerat58> as PattyCakes says, keep that resume updated
[13:44:12] <koollman> once, I had to present my case directly using the bus factor. "So, if I get hit by a bus tomorrow, this is the estimate of how much it's going to cost you to keep things running, and this is how much it would cost to get a team to work on any downtime"
[13:44:21] <kerat58> but if you're aligned for other reasons then there's one thing I can give you from about 10 years ago 
[13:44:24] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> and esp now im getting real capex approved, why jump now XD
[13:44:25] <koollman> "oh ... well, sure, you can have another backup server and we will hire someone" :)
[13:44:32] <kerat58> which is my brief foray with "bullshit small businesses"
[13:44:40] <kerat58> the hit by a bus factor is a good one
[13:44:42] <PattyCakes> I work with and have to train fresh blood and breaking that "We have to do it this way because this is how it should be done" attitude can be rough
[13:45:08] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> @koolman exacttly "why shopuld we buy support, we have you?"
[13:45:14] <PattyCakes> it's a real wake up call when someone finally understands, you ain't the boss - sometimes you present a good argument and the boss disagrees
[13:45:15] <kerat58> but sometimes, bullshit small business is a very much psychological / human situation instead of a technical one
[13:45:20] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> yeah, im poushing hard onf the hit by a bus factor side
[13:45:28] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> agree 100% kerat
[13:45:35] <PattyCakes> that's totally fair kerat58 looooool
[13:45:38] <kerat58> so, you can take this or leave it, but here's what I did 
[13:45:39] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> its all 'human'/meat brain thigns
[13:45:58] <kerat58> that password reset situation is almost identcal to the one that was causing me to ruin my cigar smoking time at 7pm on a friday
[13:45:59] <PattyCakes> that under 50 employee family run bullshit construction business that needs someone to fix their computers?
[13:46:03] <PattyCakes> yea FUCK that company
[13:46:12] <PattyCakes> my health can't take that kind of stress
[13:46:14] <kerat58> here's what i did
[13:46:24] <kerat58> i sent an email saying we need XYZ solution
[13:46:50] <kerat58> two weeks later I sent another with bullet points outlining cases in the past 2 weeks where XYZ could've helped
[13:47:01] <kerat58> two weeks after that, when employees were calling my cell, I had turned my cell off.
[13:47:03] <kerat58> For the whole day.
[13:47:06] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> oooh
[13:47:07] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> thats good
[13:47:11] <kerat58> I was smoking my cigars and watching the sunset
[13:47:14] <PattyCakes> best feeling int he world kerat58, doing all that, not getting any response - and escalating that 3am password reset to a VP or C level.
[13:47:26] <kerat58> The next day I opened my email
[13:47:56] <kerat58> and said "Unfortunately I was out of cell coverage on personal leave, but XYZ could've helped as I said 4 weeks ago orignally and 2 weeks ago with <these real world cases mentioned>"
[13:48:05] <kerat58> It appears our problem is an organizational one, not a technical one.
[13:48:10] <kerat58> I can only propose solutions.
[13:48:15] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> yup
[13:48:17] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> so much that
[13:48:17] <koollman> technical problems are 'easy' in comparison :)
[13:48:22] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> ^^^^
[13:48:49] <kerat58> In the "under 50 employee family run bullshit construction business" scenario as PattyCakes notes...somoene will be pissed that THEIR specific concern wasn't dealt on the spot
[13:48:52] <PattyCakes> We can solve most technical, logistical, and logical problems. We however can not solve stupid, humans, or stupid humans
[13:49:02] <kerat58> but that is where you will see whether the company is going to be good long term or not
[13:49:12] <kerat58> because if the owner says "Enough is enough let's do XYZ" then you just won 
[13:49:26] <kerat58> if not, then you know the place isn't ever going to change, and your cell phone will be rinigng at 7pm on a friday every time you try to light up a cigar
[13:49:34] <kerat58> so either way you figure out quite a lot 
[13:49:36] <kerat58> in only 4 weeks
[13:49:41] <kerat58> but it does take that planning and "documenting" :)
[13:49:53] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> my problem is I trust/like the team here too much and no jsut how damaing thigns could be/feel too much profesional repsosibility to let things just 'fall'
[13:49:59] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> but yeah, maybe doing that on a 'softer' level
[13:50:08] <PattyCakes> I've been apart of radical changes because someone was woken up who normally expects to not be woken up kerat58 
[13:50:09] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> or hell, maybe I should jsut use my leave XD
[13:50:20] <kerat58> PattyCakes - i can tell man
[13:50:30] <PattyCakes> it's my favorite power move
[13:50:31] <kerat58> just on your commentary LO
[13:50:32] <kerat58> LOL
[13:50:48] <kerat58> and that is an awesome move
[13:50:52] <PattyCakes> because either I'm fucking right, or I'm fucking fired
[13:50:57] <kerat58> because the other person would do the same shit to you
[13:51:30] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> I'm in an odd spot
[13:51:31] <PattyCakes> I've never ruined a honeymoon, but I've ruined vacations :P
[13:51:40] <kerat58> exactly
[13:51:45] <kerat58> and I've had vacations ruined 
[13:51:49] <kerat58> my vacations
[13:51:56] <kerat58> so that's why I say, none of this is shit that someone won't do to you
[13:52:02] <PattyCakes> I'll give ya 2 passes, well 3 cause covid is a thing
[13:52:07] <PattyCakes> Child Birth, Honeymoon, Covid
[13:52:14] <PattyCakes> other than that, you're fair game in my book
[13:52:28] <PattyCakes> I'll allow a funeral or two maybe
[13:53:35] <PattyCakes> but if you got director or VP in your title? You are 24x7 (and they _really_ don't like you reminding them of that)
[13:53:52] <kerat58> yeah they only expect the 24x7 thing to apply to others.
[13:53:59] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> nah

[13:58:05] <kerat58> it just depends on how that circle is drawn

[13:59:44] <PattyCakes> ok, well that's a start.
[13:59:54] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> ive been tired, ive been fucked aorund, ive been stressed, but never not wanted the job as such
[13:59:55] <PattyCakes> are you having fun?
[14:00:30] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> outside of trying to juggle the 'intricacies' of running the IT side this is baicaly dream job material
[14:00:45] <PattyCakes> if ya don't hate it, and you're having fun - I'd already consider you pretty lucky
[14:00:50] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> yeah
[14:01:35] <PattyCakes> I don't love my job, there's 1000 other things I'd rather be doing. That siad, those 1000 things don't pay, and I also don't hate it as well as having fun
[14:01:38] <PattyCakes> so it's all a trade off
[14:01:43] <PattyCakes> work to live, don't live to work
[14:01:48] <PattyCakes> I should put away my soap box now
[14:02:22] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> the one thign i struggle wiht is
[14:02:22] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> 
[14:02:22] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> I put in a lot of time and effort to maintain the aplce to the best of my capability - above and beyodn thigns like work hours etc
[14:02:22] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> I do this because i feel responsible for the palce on a more eprsonal level because its a small business team and we get along etc

[14:02:23] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> but at the same time, the inability to 'manage my risk' and resposibility due to some fo the pushback i get at times is... hard to take

[14:02:44] <PattyCakes> yea, get over that

[14:03:11] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> thats harder to externalise
[14:04:21] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> yeah, I know
[14:05:14] <PattyCakes> you gotta live with yourself, you gotta be able to sleep at night, if you mentally feel as if these people are family and you feel you need to do what you do  - the only thing to be said is at least make sure you get paid.
[14:05:48] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> I get paid well
[14:06:03] <sd> 12<câ€‹ooleb09> 'eroneously well' at times depending on whic director approves pay run
[14:06:04] <PattyCakes> I've been burned 12 too many times by the family bullshit, and I'm jaded beyond normal probably. Everyone including your own blood family will screw you over in my experience...

[21:16:22] <doubletwist> If you were given a 'devops' type challenge to provision a basic 'two-tier sample application' - would 'haproxy' + 'someapp' qualify? Or would you expect 'someapp' + 'somedb'? Or am I over-thinking it.

[21:38:17] <monr0e> doubletwist: 1: Presentation layer 2: Application layer 3: Data layer. In a two-tier application, the client system handles presentation and application layers. The third tier is a separate application, and the two entities communicate. In short, you need to write something that executes at the client, but stores data with the server.
