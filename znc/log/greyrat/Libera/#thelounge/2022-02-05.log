[03:36:36] <bookworm> johncs: I guess you want the pre commit hook to actually do the formatting rather than erroring out? If so, don't you find it annoying? Do you ever stage only parts of a file? How does your editor handle the newly written file that you probably still have open?
[03:37:23] <johncs> Just checking the formatting would be better than nothing
[03:37:33] <johncs> But yes, I do like it to actually do the formatting

[03:38:05] <johncs> It's not annoying. I actually had the same thought and the first time I set up a pre-commit hook around formatting I had it only check it and error out if the formatter would've made any changes.

[03:38:39] <johncs> But after awhile I found it was much more convenient to just have it do the formatting for me. It doesn't end up causing any practical problems, even in the case of partial commits I haven't had issues.
[03:39:12] *** Joins: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c)
[03:39:17] <bookworm> well, pretty-quick currently aborts the commit if you do that
[03:39:25] <bookworm> and that's what TL uses
[03:39:37] <johncs> It aborts the commit if there are partially added files?
[03:39:41] <bookworm> yes
[03:39:49] <bookworm> at least the docs say so
[03:40:43] <johncs> That seems a bit silly, it should fall back to just checking the formatting at least. But that won't actually cause any problems for me either.
[03:40:47] <bookworm> for me, formatting belongs at the editor level personally
[03:41:07] <johncs> I have a great "stash all unstaged and untracked changes" script
[03:41:32] <johncs> I feel it. I prefer my editor to be quite dumb honestly. Though I've been enjoying typescript integration.
[03:42:02] <johncs> I've never had my editor do anything automatic like that
[03:42:16] <johncs> I'd prefer it in the hooks üòÖ. Not sure why, but it feels more right
[03:42:30] <bookworm> and then magic in a hook so that what you see in a diff isn't actually what you commit oO ?
[03:42:45] <bookworm> I can't follow that reasoning
[03:43:29] <bookworm> does your editor transparently reload changed files from disc?
[03:43:34] <johncs> Haha it depends how much you trust your formatter. Again, I started out that way, only allowing the formatter to check it, but it's real nice to just have it do it itself.
[03:43:40] <bookworm> without complain that it had to do that?
[03:44:00] <bookworm> sure, I have it as a pre-save operation
[03:44:04] <johncs> It uses some heuristic. Oftentimes it asks.
[03:44:23] <bookworm> but then my editor immediately displays the changes and I can undo it and such things
[03:44:29] <johncs> I think your setup is very reasonable
[03:44:35] <johncs> But this is definitely in the realm of taste
[03:44:57] <bookworm> ah, no offense intended. I just need to know what you want to have
[03:45:12] <bookworm> might just bring back pretty-quick and call it a day
[03:45:22] *** Joins: locke789 (~locke789@103.159.43.201)
[03:45:37] <johncs> no offense taken. dev setups are always quite interesting :)
[03:45:54] <johncs> I have some bash scripts we can use if you'd like. but yeah I'm happy with just using pretty-quick.
[03:46:15] <bookworm> I'm in the bash script camp personally
[03:46:31] <bookworm> but it gets hairy really fast if you want to have it robust
[03:47:08] <johncs> definitely. there's quite a bit of development I've done just on my supporting scripts. And I have linting setup for the scripts themselves (always love making a script lint itself)
[03:47:10] <bookworm> using stash can in some cases nuke work so I don't want to use that
[03:47:26] <johncs> For sure... i've been working on a wrapper around stash that gives a better interface
[03:47:34] <johncs> fairly nascent at the moment, but i'm excited about it :)
[03:47:50] <johncs> my "pop previously unstated changes" script is delightfully hacky
[03:47:52] <bookworm> push it upstream and we'll talk
[03:48:01] <johncs> ahaha definitely not
[03:48:09] <bookworm> then I can ignore it for a decade same as git switch and we're good
[03:48:18] <johncs> üòÜ same
[03:48:28] <bookworm> you can take checkout out of my cold dead hands
[03:48:51] <johncs> i used restore the other day though, it was quite convenient to bring a file to a state of a previous commit
[03:48:54] <johncs> it's growing on me

[03:51:30] <bookworm> cat-file if you just wanna look at it
[03:51:40] <johncs> omg I didn't know that form. I've always piped the output of `git show commit:file` into the file to do it
[03:52:21] <bookworm> many ways to get to Rome
[03:52:23] <johncs> though tbh I do like using git show like that... it's usually convenient because I can build the command slowly and fairly interactively
[03:52:43] <johncs> for sure, especially with git
[03:53:30] <bookworm> can you shoot me your bash based pre-commit hooks? Or are they proprietary?
[03:54:09] <johncs> haha they are closed source but they're still mine, I'm happy to share. No trade secrets in my bash hackery üòÜ
[03:54:41] <johncs> lemme get something together that'll be useful
[03:55:15] <bookworm> thanks :)
[03:55:48] <bookworm> also no rush, whenever you find time
[04:01:01] <johncs> https://gist.github.com/itsjohncs/a237ef00da77bcb1911c777e1cdbc365
[04:01:53] <johncs> I wasn't sure what'd be useful so I just grabbed the pre-commit hook itself. There's a bunch of other stuff that might be useful but this at least has the "which files have changed" as well as how I handle prettifying only when there's no partially added files.
[04:02:45] <johncs> I'll note that the linter checks the file formatting. So in the event of a partially added file, the files are still checked to see if they're formatted correctly.
