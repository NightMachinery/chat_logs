[01:32:46] <the4oo4> I have the option of gnome, gnome classic, and system x11 default, but they all use x11 instead of wayland
[01:33:16] <somiaj> the4oo4: check demsg -i | grep firmware (are you having trouble loading any firmware for i915), also can you think of any change you have had on your system since it worked
[01:33:20] <somiaj> and what version of debian are you running?

[01:38:11] <somiaj> I don't use waylend so I'm mostly guessing, but the other thing is maybe make sure all the required packages are installed, how did you install gnome orignally (from the installer?)

'gnome-core' (like 3, minus end-user applications) 5. 'gnome-session gdm3 network-manager-gnome' (minimalist, not recommended).  You will need Xorg installed as well, ask me about <install x>.  https://wiki.debian.org/Gnome

[03:38:43] <somiaj> yea, exim4 depends on exim4-daemon-light | exim4-daemon-heavy, so even installing the metapackage ill pull in the light pcakage (about 1.5M) unless you need to
[03:39:15] <somiaj> also postfix too has a lot of additional packages you can install to increase its functionality, seems exim just bundels it in exim4-daemon-heavy to include all features if needed

[03:48:07] <Marz> i am not hosting mail.
[03:48:27] <somiaj> But that is the hard balance, the more you lock things up, the more interconnected parts need to behave nicely

[03:48:52] <sney> a lot of hardening guides forget an important part of security, which is step 1: define a threat model

[03:49:21] <sney> without knowing where you need to put your walls, so to speak, you can easily end up hardening the system against yourself by accident. or missing stuff and being insecure. or both

[04:00:46] <craigevil> Marz, why not use whatever mail client the DE you have installed uses? or there is claws or thunerbird
[04:01:29] <Marz> this is just for root emails. exim light or exim same install size. it is no big deal
[04:02:32] <Blondie101010> edufmass:  that can vastly vary depending on what you do
[04:03:09] <Blondie101010> it might be a good idea to completely separate your data on a separate partition/drive
[04:03:39] <Blondie101010> that way, you do a small root and adjust data as needed
[04:04:14] <Blondie101010> you can do that on / but separating data simplifies a lot of things

[04:07:19] <somiaj> kevinnn: You have two seperate issues here, so attack each.
[04:07:32] <greycat> !autologin
[04:07:32] <dpkg> If you want an insecure box that boots into a session with your user.  Xdm cannot do autologin but gdm and kdm can if you really want them to.  (But do you?) The <nodm> package is a good way of automating this.
[04:07:52] <greycat> hmm, I expected a slightly more informative factoid
[04:08:12] <greycat> nevertheless, various Display Managers have an autologin feature.  look up how to do it in yours.
[04:08:23] <somiaj> kevinnn: For auto login, I belive xfce uses lightdm, and there are ways to make lightdm automatically login for you (you'll have to look that up), and (b) You need to disable screen locking, this should be under the xfce settings somewhere.
[04:08:52] <kevinnn> somiaj: so I have it logging in automatically for me already...
[04:08:53] <somiaj> kevinnn: https://askubuntu.com/questions/530072/how-to-auto-login-in-xubuntu-or-ubuntu-server-with-xfce -- seems to have some info
[04:09:07] <somiaj> kevinnn: okay, step two is just go disable screen locking
[04:09:33] <kevinnn> somiaj: yup, the challenge is that I need to do it through cli only
[04:09:35] <somiaj> kevinnn: that site has extra info, something liek rigth click system tray power icon, and under preferences.
[04:09:43] <somiaj> why cli only?
[04:09:55] <kevinnn> This thing is set up as a kiosk
[04:10:02] <kevinnn> soooo no task bar or anything
[04:10:26] <Blondie101010> edufmass:  for that use case, NSF is probably better but both a good options

[12:24:32] <shad> Hi, I have this weird issue on Debian 11, the laptop won't connect to wifi automatically, instead it complains that the network needs a password to be accessed. However, when I go to "WiFi Settings" and click the network i'm interested in i get instantly connected. It probably has to do with the fact that i've purged KDE and installed Gnome instead. Anyone ever had something similar ?

[17:41:40] <ecraven> policykit-1 has been 0.105 since at least stretch
[17:42:10] <ecraven> will experimental be the next release?
[17:42:24] <jelly> 0.105 with lots of distro-specific fixes
[17:42:31] <jelly> 31 of them
[17:43:16] <jelly> no, what's in "sid" may be part of next release.  Experimental is for stuff that is known to be unfit for a release
[17:43:22] <jelly> !experimental
[17:43:23] <dpkg> experimental is the bleeding edge of Debian Development.  Packages here have been deemed unfit/DANGEROUS/untrustworthy/etc for release by the maintainer responsible for them.  DO NOT INSTALL PACKAGES FROM EXPERIMENTAL WITHOUT KNOWING EXACTLY WHY AND WHAT YOU ARE DOING.  #debian does _not_ support experimental.  For an actual description, see section 4.6.4.3 of the Developer's Reference.  http://packages.debian.org/experimental/
[17:43:33] <PerfDave> https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/policykit-1 shows its history. I'm sure you could email the team if you want to offer to help, but it won't get upgraded in a stable release until Debian 12 comes out.
[17:44:17] <jelly> if you're stumbling onto a particular bug, that might be addressed for stable if it's really common and affects many/most setups
[17:44:24] <ecraven> thanks a lot for the help!
[17:45:07] <jelly> but you won't see 0.119 in debian 11, and it _has_ to appear in sid branch first to be eligible for debian 12

[17:46:12] <jelly> ecraven, do you have an actual bug that needs fixing?
[17:46:30] <ecraven> from my (very limited) understanding, the maintainer about 10 years ago objected to the switch from static configuration files to javascript config files, so it was never updated
[17:47:29] <PerfDave> https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=policykit-1&suite=experimental looks to me that it's failing to build on a couple of Debian's architectures.
[17:47:29] <ecraven> jelly: yes, the static file format is not powerful enough to express a restriction I want to add. I want to restrict dbus so that a given user can send a specific message (restart service foo) to systemd. right now (with the static format), I can just restrict which user can manage units, but cannot restrict *what* he can do nor *which* units he can do it to
[17:47:35] <ecraven> that's my understanding ;)

[18:09:40] <pert> like a realtime kernel? Debian does have those, but I don't know enough about real-time systems and whether that's actually what you are looking for

[18:14:54] <pert> don't worry about it. if you find out you need a realtime kernel later (you most probably won't), they're packaged so it's easy to install one
[18:15:30] <Haohmaru> webby then i don't think you have to worry, unless there happens to be an actual problem

[20:00:16] <ghormoon> maybe i can do it and hope that i get a resolution soon for 5.10 :D

[20:00:23] <jelly> ghormoon, until 4.19.0-18-amd64 happens
[20:00:43] <jelly> sure screen with ^a H (hardcopy) would work as well but...

[20:01:24] <PerfDave> jelly: Also ^A H for screenlogging

[20:01:47] <jelly> PerfDave, that's what I said!
[20:01:59] <ghormoon> but then i somehow need to force it not to pull  linux-image-amd64 from bullseye as it will be newer
[20:02:08] <jelly> that's what pinning is for
[20:02:09] <anchovy> jelly: that also gets me the prettification of the output.
[20:02:34] <jelly> anchovy, script saves all tty output, including control characters, yes
[20:02:36] <PerfDave> jelly: I misread slightly; hardcopy is "^A h" which is a single screencap; log is "^A H" which is a continous log

[20:04:06] <dpkg> There is no "bullseye/updates" repository for security updates. To reduce confusion with <bullseye-updates> (which is for other bug fixes), security updates are distributed via the <bullseye-security> repository "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main". Note that you may also need to adjust your Default-Release and pinning settings for apt.

[23:36:18] <XileX> Yes, I have used unstable repo and installed things using aptitude
[23:36:21] <neilthereildeil> can someone please help?

[23:36:51] <PMT> XileX: i mean, i'd just have set it up to pin the experimental packages and put the rest of experimental at -1 or w/e
[23:36:57] <neilthereildeil> thats what happens when i try to install a package
[23:37:14] <PMT> neilthereildeil: usually that means you need to run an apt update

[23:47:14] <PMT> buster changed to oldstable with the release of bullseye, but that implies you hadn't run apt{,-get} update in a while.

[23:48:53] <PMT> Curious. Unfortunately, the evidence of the prior state is now clobbered.
[23:49:37] <XileX> PMT: Thank you. It seems that one other solution for me was 'aptitude search "?narrow(?installed,?archive(experimental))"'
[23:50:56] <PMT> neilthereildeil: perhaps using apt used different HTTP headers so the proxy didn't cache it? Just a thought.
