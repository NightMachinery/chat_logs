[19:45:31] <confuzeus> assuming you have data in R with things aligned into 6X4 cells  as , say df. t(df) will give you a different perspective of the data and you can work your way around it ... or you could try reshaping it directly without transposing first

[20:10:18] <velix> It's a huge Excel file.
[20:10:23] <velix> But no trouble. I just did it in php ;)
[20:10:24] <velix> Thanks a lot.
[20:10:36] <velix> R is too complicated for this :(
[20:11:34] <velix> The original file was 50 x 2075 rows. Crazy people, who're creating those :D
[20:12:38] <confuzeus>  r can read billions before you finish cup of coffee or beer...
[20:14:03] <velix> php took 17 lines (with comments) and 0.72 seconds to read/write.
[20:14:15] <velix> Sorry, I'm into php since 2003.
[20:14:22] <velix> I love R, but I'm not keen in it.
[20:15:00] <confuzeus> r will take 1/2 lines to read and write.
[20:15:40] <Bayes> no need to be sorry, use whatever it works for you velix
[20:16:05] <velix> confuzeus: read/write ... the transform is missing here ;)
[20:16:08] <Bayes> I was happy to help but you just saved me half a hour by using php, so I'm glad you did :D
[20:16:34] <velix> I've send the professor the dataset now, he needed it to keep on working.
[20:16:41] <velix> So I've time now to figure it out in R
[20:17:05] <velix> let me look up dpit and df. and t(df)
[20:17:07] <confuzeus> great. use whatever tool get the job done on time
[20:17:25] <velix> oh great, teams is down. he didn't see that I finished the data ;)

[20:18:09] <velix> maybe a fax is even better, he's old
[20:18:25] <confuzeus> lol.
[20:18:28] <velix> I love to send fax, because it makes strange noises at the receiver.
[20:18:51] <velix> So the change is high that the message gets read.
[20:20:01] <confuzeus> ok. so your prof just done not care about reproducibility? what confidence will they have that the reshaping has went well? eyeballing?

[21:24:48] <velix> Bayes: https://bpa.st/RDUQ
[21:26:53] <velix> aaah, this might help: https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_longer.html
[21:33:28] <velix> No, doesn't seem to work
[21:37:38] <confuzeus> i think you will be faster translating your php into R code than start using some specialised R library as entry point.
[21:38:16] <confuzeus> of course you code may be inefficient at first but it is likely to work fine
[21:38:27] <velix> yeah, the problem is the duplicate colum name.
[21:38:30] <velix> R can't handle this :(
[21:38:48] <velix> The php code is damn easy. Simple loops
[21:38:50] <confuzeus> it works with duplicate columns fine!
[21:39:07] <confuzeus> you can use loops in no problem
[21:39:11] <velix> confuzeus: no. it renames the columns to "street 2..3" and "street 2..4" here :D
[21:39:44] <confuzeus> you can choose read those columns as data.
[21:39:55] <confuzeus> column names i mean.
[21:40:51] <Bayes> anyone using ratpak, conda, env, R pacman, or something like that to make sure that dependencies are in place?
[21:40:54] <confuzeus> also, you can refer to columns by position rather than by name
[21:40:57] <Bayes> rickyrick ^
[21:42:06] <confuzeus> since having duplicate reference is not likely to work reliably in useful languages
[21:42:29] <Bayes> rickyrick also https://ca.ovh.com/asia/order/vps/?v=3#/vps/build?selection=~(range~'Starter) and https://irssi.org/
[21:48:33] <velix> confuzeus: sorry, library(readr) cannot do this.
[21:48:39] <velix> confuzeus: It always renames the columns
[21:49:18] <velix> confuzeus: base also renames them.
[21:49:56] <confuzeus> no, you just have not taken time to understand R. that is not true for both readr and base R
[21:52:00] <confuzeus> there are flags like header=,skip, ... and also you can specify your own column names directly.
[21:53:30] <velix> confuzeus: readr always issues name_repair for duplicate col_names. And you can set this to minimal only.
[21:53:56] <velix> (also to others, but those will make them unique, what I don't want)
[21:54:48] <confuzeus> how does php handle this? 
[21:54:59] <velix> ahh, minimal did it.
[21:55:11] <velix> confuzeus: Hm? Not at all ;) I'm reading it into an array and process it.
[21:55:31] <velix> `name_repair = minimal` did it.
[21:55:49] <velix> okay 1 of 99 problems fixed \o/
[21:56:22] <confuzeus> you can do the same in R. with readLines() though you would have to save the excel file as a csv.
[21:56:55] <velix> confuzeus: sure. But I want to try it the tidyverse way :) it looks more flexible.
[21:58:05] <confuzeus> get it but if all you knew was php, i think try the way similar to php will save you time. there is some learning curve with tidyverse.
[21:58:39] <velix> confuzeus: challenge accepted.
[22:05:17] <velix> ha! 2 of 99 problems solved.
[22:05:24] <velix> 96 to go
[22:05:42] <velix> you'll never be able  to solve all the issues...
[22:08:52] <confuzeus> you have to approach like you are learning a new language but you can boostrap all your other languages knowledge. loops, arrays, math,...
[22:10:28] <confuzeus> like if you know excel some of the functions are in r too.
[22:11:06] <velix> confuzeus: I like the trial and error principe.
[22:11:16] <velix> brute-forcing until I get it working.
[22:11:53] <confuzeus> it works but sometimes the error messages in r are not very informative
[22:12:36] <velix> confuzeus: I'm not getting errors, but bad results ;)
[22:12:40] <velix> wrong results*
[22:13:09] <velix> I'm currently trying, how to multiplex the values from the 2nd row. gimme 2-3 hours and I'll fix it
[22:14:07] <confuzeus> but brute force will not help with that. reading how to access values in a vector or list may help
[22:42:55] <velix> yeah, I'm stuck indeed :D

[22:56:26] <confuzeus> velix: weren't you using for at least two years? so you have been googling along? i am wondering why it is taking you long to manipulate data in R if you have been using it for a while
[22:56:37] <confuzeus> using R
[22:58:53] <velix> confuzeus: I'm doing other stuff in R than data manipulation ;)
[22:59:00] <velix> Normally I'm doing this stuff in php
[22:59:32] <confuzeus> ok.
[23:15:04] <since_> awk is fun
[23:18:16] <confuzeus> just not with csv files!
[23:25:02] <confuzeus> my gripe with awk is that it never fails except for syntax errors so needs someone extremely meticulous. not most of us who start digging for gold without studying the geology of the area
