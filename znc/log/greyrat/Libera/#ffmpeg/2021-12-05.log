[12:47:20] <cryptic> I'm trying to preserve the most recent 60 minutes of a live camera feed accessible over https via an .m3u8 'playlist' file that references another .m3u8 'chunklist' file that points to the three most recent .ts files. I was thinking about using ffmpeg's hls demuxer on the input (with the default options) and the hls muxer on the output with hls_start_number_source=generic, hls_time=10, hls_list_size=360, hls_delete_threshold=30 and
[12:47:20] <cryptic> hls_flags=delete_segments+program_date_time+second_level_segment_index+omit_endlist+discont_start, which works just fine. However, this might not be practical, because I really don't need the output m3u8 file to exist until an external event is reported to trigger persistent storage of the exact data downloaded from the server. Due to reliability issues with the input source, I'm thinking it might just be better to use python to parse
[12:47:21] <cryptic> the input m3u8 files, download new .ts files, handle the myriad HTTP errors that will arise, and (when signaled via the occurrence of a specific event) use ffmpeg to concatenate the ephemerally-stored .ts input files into a persisently-stored mp4 output file. Does that sound reasonable?

[15:02:50] <durandal_1707> MG2021: whats wrong on using epic BINK2 decoder?
[15:03:04] <durandal_1707> it can transcode losslessly just fine last time i checked
[15:03:19] <durandal_1707> just use lossless encoder and store in avi
[15:03:59] <MG2021> on the site i send in this room theres nothing that i can find that mention to pay for things you want!

[15:06:44] <MG2021> lossless is not lossless:  still remove information because you don't support the same pixel format (yuv vs. rgb, 16 bit vs. 8 bit etc.)
[15:07:32] <durandal_1707> MG2021: you mean bink2 tools internally converts from yuv to rgb?
[15:07:59] <durandal_1707> that could be true, but does that really matter?

[16:07:27] <emcodem> i can get it to actually seek but i am under the impression that the changed pts always leads to problems, e.g. when i use movie and then ovleray, after seeking, no more frames are pulled from movie at all
[16:08:04] <durandal_1707> yea, need to reset pts to match with other input of overlay

[16:10:44] <durandal_1707> setpts filter would need also some form of reset command to reset STARTPTS
[16:11:22] <durandal_1707> that all looks hacky to me
[16:11:33] <emcodem> but how is it supposed to work actually?
[16:11:48] <emcodem> i mean the way it is now i cannot imagine in what way it could be utilized successfully
[16:12:38] <durandal_1707> use setpts filter to change output pts from movie filter to be always continuous

[16:13:46] <emcodem> time(0) ?
[16:14:11] <durandal_1707> dunno, if video is CFR just set some formula

[16:45:21] <durandal11707> so overlay is not problem here but  movie filter?
[16:45:25] <emcodem> yes
[16:45:27] <emcodem> definitely
[16:45:37] <durandal11707> report bug on trac
[16:45:49] <emcodem> you think there is a bug really?
[16:46:00] <durandal11707> make sure that seek point is actually there
[16:46:02] <emcodem> im not 100% sure if i use it correctly
[16:46:14] <durandal11707> so that duration is correct
[16:46:35] <durandal11707> and seek happens to the correct spot
[16:46:43] *** Quits: xkuru (~xkuru@user/xkuru) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[16:46:52] <emcodem> should be able to do that
[16:47:39] <durandal11707> timestamps are set in AV_TIME_BASE unit
[16:47:54] <emcodem> i debugged what -ss does set and used that value
[16:48:07] <emcodem> seemed to work, i saw it encoding the correct frames once
[16:48:16] <durandal11707> 1 second is 1000000
[16:48:42] <emcodem> thats what i do all -1 seek 0|1000000|1
[16:49:15] <durandal11707> but note that timestamps of video starts from 0
[16:49:44] <emcodem> it should be always able to seek to 0
[16:49:56] <emcodem> like "all -1 seek 0|0|1"
[16:51:29] <emcodem> my god, it IS able to seek to zero, everything works as expected
[16:51:55] <emcodem> WHY is it always like you first play for hours and as soon as you seek help it works? :D

[22:19:46] <emcodem> yeah ok
[22:19:59] <DHE> concat filter says it assumes the number of audio channels is 0 by default, so I say yes
[22:20:02] <DHE> https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#concat
[22:21:11] <DHE> also, just as a style thing, why not remove the [rsclbf0] labels and just use another comma instead?
[22:22:10] <DHE> and I've never seen [rscl0:v] syntax before...
[22:22:47] <jokoon> What do you mean use another comma? Could you give an example?
[22:23:03] <jokoon> maybe [rscl0:v] is wrong
[22:23:31] <DHE> well right now the syntax you're using is:  [0:v] scale,pad,setsar[rsclbf0]; [rsclbf0]fps[rscl0]
[22:23:50] <DHE> why not just use: [0:v] scale,pad,setsar,fps[rscl0]

[22:44:34] <JEEB> so he at that point can just start learning how to code to finish this feature
[22:44:51] <MG202180> kepstin only devs like you
[22:45:37] <MG202180> please listen devs, you have no idea how popular ffmpeg is and how powerful is in multimedia world
[22:45:41] <emcodem> @MG202180
[22:45:53] <kepstin> the only major contributions i've made to ffmpeg have actually been for issues that I hit at my dayjob, who paid me to get them fixed.
[22:46:08] <emcodem> are you the user "PCUser" in the ticket?
[22:46:18] <MG202180> no
[22:46:35] <MG202180> i dont have any account on github
[22:46:37] <MG202180> why
[22:47:55] <emcodem> because the user was asking like "Why don't you add Bink 2 to FFmpeg after 6 years!?"
[22:47:56] <MG202180> i work with streamers
[22:48:07] <emcodem> it's kind of forcing something that cannot be forced...
[22:48:20] <jokoon> what about my problem :D
[22:48:27] <emcodem> the answer is "because nobody was interested to do it so far"
[22:49:08] <emcodem> @jokoon i thought you were just posting a statement hehe.. maybe it is good to post your current command and the problem you have with it
[22:49:28] <MG202180> i I just quoted that cove and I'm surprised that after 6 years this important format is still not supported
[22:49:35] <JEEB> because this is open source
[22:49:48] <JEEB> and because this is rolling on people's free time
[22:50:02] <JEEB> someone did the great job of making the patch that has been linked to you
[22:50:32] <MG202180> almost everyone is using ffmpeg codes
[22:50:33] <JEEB> it is not finished (deblocking or whatever else was missing so you get artifacts) and it has no FATE test which is why it didn't go in :P
[22:50:36] <JEEB> yes we know
[22:50:36] <kepstin> because it wasn't "important" enough for any company who employs ffmpeg devs to do it, and because none of the volunteer devs have had sufficient interest or ability to finish it. that's really the entire reason why it's not supported.

[22:55:36] <BtbN> FFmpeg has no obligation whatsoever to support specific formats. Every single thing it supports was added because someone wanted it so much they added it themselves, or paid someone to do it.
[22:55:45] <kepstin> well, insulting people in the ffmpeg channel is definitely not the way to try to convince volunteers to do something for you of their own goodwill.
[22:55:46] <emcodem> @jokoon i suggest you reduce to 1 or 2 inputs only and post the full command
[22:56:23] <MG202180> kepstin he started to insulting me!
[22:57:27] *** Joins: CounterPillow (~Pillow@overviewer/CounterPillow)
[22:58:09] <emcodem> anyway @MG you should now have a good understanding about what your options are... what you currently do is not helpful to get to your goal
[23:00:39] <MG202180> emcodem no one care about requests, but $
[23:01:47] <MG202180> cares*
[23:02:15] <emcodem> nah, i don't think the paid time invested to ffmpeg is more than the free time...
[23:03:09] <emcodem> you just need to find someone who is interested in both, getting your codec into ffmpeg AND ffmpeg development
[23:04:57] <emcodem> also, you need to understand that it is not only about getting the stuff done but also maintaining it. The person who submits an accepted patch for a new decoder is also responsible for it in future
[23:05:55] <MG202180> which means only official ffmpeg's devs can do it
[23:06:02] <JEEB> nope
[23:06:14] <JEEB> anyone can do it
[23:06:30] <kepstin> (this is part of the reason why writing tests are important - it's very likely that security issues will be found in any new decoder, and you want to make sure any fixes, especially by people unrelated to the code, don't break it)
[23:06:48] <JEEB> MG202180: the only reason money got into there is because you cannot gift people more time. clearly a request was noted as interesting by the person who started the development, but people have life, priorities, other things they need to get done etc.
[23:07:10] <JEEB> thus just complaining here why it is not finished yet is really not in any way or form productive
[23:07:27] <MG202180> no one No one accepts responsibility
[23:07:29] <emcodem> uh @kepstin thanks, you remind me that one fate test i submitted was not pulled actually...
[23:08:12] <kepstin> MG202180: that's the fun thing about open source, if you want something done, *you* have to accept responsibility for it.
[23:09:06] <MG202180> they dont do it for free
[23:09:13] <jokoon> emcodem, https://bpa.st/I6HA this seems to work but I don't know why the longer version doesn't
[23:09:26] <BtbN> A lot of people do that for free.
[23:09:30] <JEEB> I do a lot of stuff for free
[23:09:30] <jokoon> oh some files don't have audio
[23:09:31] <emcodem> @MG we're here in the chat for free ;-)
[23:09:43] <JEEB> most of the time I spend on FFmpeg etc is my own free time
[23:09:50] <jokoon> wait because it works with some files missing audio...
[23:09:53] <MG202180> so why dont you do it for free then
[23:10:02] <JEEB> because I have my own priorities etc
[23:10:06] <JEEB> as I said, priorities etc
[23:10:06] <BtbN> Because we don't care about bink video enough
[23:10:30] <JEEB> I like being able to play my bink2 video clips from games, sure. but I have a *lot* of stuff higher than it on my prio list
[23:10:59] <emcodem> i second @JEEB here, the thing is that there is so much i want to do with ffmpeg and your stuff just didnt catch my interest, so no way you can get me on your side
[23:11:10] <kepstin> in my case, because the only thing i have time to do off the clock at my company is help folks on irc a bit.
[23:11:14] <MG202180> bink is very important: for example i need to install extra rad game tool for playing it, but with ffmpeg support, i can play it with mpc-hc
[23:11:24] <kepstin> it's important to you
[23:11:32] <kepstin> that doesn't mean it's important to other people
[23:12:55] <MG202180> its very important for youtubers who uses adobe products like: premiere pro media encoder after effects and audition
[23:13:02] <JEEB> like, that's the difference with paid software. with paid software if you were a big enough customer you'd maybe have a say on priorities. with open source unless you can offer something to someone to change their priorities etc so something gets changed, it's not gonna change.
[23:13:10] <kepstin> if it's important enough to you, then you need to take responsiblity for getting it done, whether that means doing it yourself or finding/paying someone else to do it.
[23:13:19] <emcodem> @jokoon i guess you are on the right track now?
[23:13:27] <JEEB> yes, and unlike paid software you actually have the capability to finish it yourself
[23:13:34] <JEEB> (since most paid software is not OSS)
[23:13:51] <jokoon> emcodem, apparently it doesn't work when the command is too long?
[23:14:06] <MG202180> theres a plugin called autokroma influx that import ffmpeg formats to adobe products
[23:14:28] <MG202180> imports*
[23:14:53] <emcodem> @jokoon i don't think there is a "too long" restriction besides the commandline buffer... which is very small on windows actually... thats why i'd like you to post the full cmd

[23:17:59] <emcodem> full cmd please :D
[23:18:31] <emcodem> just kidding,
[23:18:50] <emcodem> so your problem is that it doesnt show you which stream actually is affected
[23:19:06] <kepstin> that's a pretty long command, heh. (have you considered using -filter_complex_script ?)
[23:19:23] <emcodem> hehe the cmd buffer is not his problem
[23:20:08] <emcodem> ah, moment, couldn't he always use the ? syntax if he is not clear if the stream exists?
[23:21:12] <emcodem> "0:a?"
[23:22:43] <emcodem> but this is not possible in filters
[23:23:26] <emcodem>  @jokoon  are you building your command by script?
[23:23:40] <kepstin> when i'm building big filter chains like this, i usually end up ffprobing all the input files to find what streams are present, and designing the commands accordingly, yeah
[23:23:52] <jokoon> emcodem, yes, one minute
[23:24:05] <kepstin> (e.g. inserting a filter to generate a silent audio track for a file with no audio)
[23:24:36] <jokoon> how would you generate a silent audio track?
[23:24:50] <emcodem> exactly what @kepstin says ... additionally, the cmd buffer will be a problem if you have more sources than you currently have
[23:25:59] <kepstin> jokoon: looks like my current solution is an aevalsrc https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/blob/develop/record-and-playback/core/lib/recordandplayback/edl/audio.rb#L23
[23:26:22] <jokoon> kepstin, emcodem here is the full command: https://bpa.st/M7TQ
[23:26:28] <kepstin> that code's kind of a mess, heh, but it works :)
[23:26:38] <emcodem> question is if you want to generate silence or just "not map" non existing streams
[23:27:13] <kepstin> if you're doing concat, every segment needs matching number of a+v tracks
[23:27:24] <jokoon> well I just want to avoid desync when concatenate, so the simplest solution is best
[23:27:26] <kepstin> (of matching lengths, as close as possible)
[23:28:05] <emcodem> the simplest solution is simple:
[23:28:31] <emcodem> first normalize all the input files to share the exact same audio and video config, then concat
[23:29:27] <jokoon> Need to search for video and audio duration in the ffprobe json first
[23:30:14] <kepstin> the ffprobe json output is very convenient indeed, i make heavy use of that :)
[23:31:51] <emcodem> @kepstin how is the duration of concat input files of interest?
[23:32:35] <kepstin> if you need to generate an audio track to match a video file with no audio, you'll need to know the length to trim it to
[23:32:59] <jokoon> emcodem, because I also have an Xstack script that goes out of sync and I want to each if all my inputs have a matching duration for audio and video
[23:33:01] <kepstin> (in the case of the bigbluebutton code i've linked, it's mostly to work around some issues with the original audio file recording tools)
[23:34:31] <emcodem> ok, so again, after many years of experience, in such cases it is best to first normalize each and every input format to share the same A/V properties
[23:35:04] <emcodem> and only after that, concat them... doing it in a single step would be better done using API
[23:35:29] <jokoon> I don't have a big disk...
[23:38:18] <jokoon> already picking several files with 1s differences... christ...
[23:38:47] <emcodem> it depends on your goal... but it sounds like you want a generic solution
[23:38:57] <jokoon> yes
[23:39:21] <jokoon> I would like to fix my other concat issue first
[23:40:07] *** Quits: dreamon (~dreamon@pd9503edd.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:40:23] <emcodem> believe me, a generic solution will take some time... it will be much more stable to follow what i said
[23:41:30] <jokoon> Can I just pick manually the guilty files and reencode them with avidemux? avidemux works pretty well
[23:42:08] <emcodem> if you just find the guilty files, you can reencode them with whatever you like :D
[23:42:57] <emcodem> in your script, just build up the cmd with all files... if it don't work, reduce the file list by one, do again...
[23:43:15] <emcodem> do this until you found one guilty file and replace it by avidemux version. then do again
[23:46:37] <jokoon> No I just will replace files with unmatching audio or video duration
[23:47:43] <jokoon> But first, my other concat issue, that it not working...
[23:48:39] <emcodem> but didnt you say your concat cmd is working for 2 files?
[23:48:47] <jokoon> it works for 10
[23:49:05] <jokoon> I guess by chance the files without audio were not in those 10
[23:49:08] <jokoon> might be the problem
[23:49:11] <emcodem> so wouldn't it work for all files unless they have unmatching A/V streams?
[23:49:40] <jokoon> any manual easy way to add a blank audio track ?
[23:50:01] <emcodem> it's not really like easy for your usecase...
[23:50:16] <emcodem> what you want to add, 1 track, 2 channels?
[23:50:36] <jokoon> doesn't matter, just a blank AAC track
[23:51:38] <emcodem> thats not how it works, you'd need to add a separate input source that generates silent audio and use this extra source in your mappings later on
[23:51:49] <emcodem> moment
[23:52:47] <emcodem> -f lavfi -i "aevalsrc=0"
[23:53:19] <emcodem> add this to your -i list and you have one source that produces silent audio... you then need to consider this in your filter chain

[23:54:18] <emcodem> you'll need to add -shortest to your command

[23:55:06] <jokoon> What other thing can I do separately?
[23:55:14] <emcodem> ?
[23:55:45] <jokoon> I mean without including this in my big command
[23:56:04] <jokoon> I mean just a thing to add a blank track, just to one file
[23:56:31] <emcodem> nothing really, you need an input source that generates the stuff you need, be it video or audio
[23:57:07] <emcodem> and in your filter chain you need to smartly map the blank sources, adding them to the sources that do not have the stuff
