[01:46:33] <bollu> rotateq where is the data of an instruction stored? I presume the instruction needs to store the two operands somewhere. Where does it do that?

[10:20:13] <bollu> Morning! I'm looking for feedback on my common lisp code: https://gist.github.com/bollu/651e643565c9d099c6a5b6d5a7fc16d5
[10:20:38] <beach> bollu: Did you see my answers to your SICL question?
[10:21:20] <beach> bollu: To begin with, you have the wrong number of semicolons for top-level comments, and your indentation is wrong.

[10:22:51] <beach> bollu: It looks like you are using lists where it would be better to use standard objects or structure objects.
[10:23:21] <beach> bollu: LET has an implicit PROGN so no need for an explicit one.
[10:24:16] <beach> bollu: Your naming convention with -> is not conventional.

[10:28:02] <beach> bollu: The code in your CASE should not be necessary.
[10:28:56] <beach> bollu: And names like BB and TY don't help the person reading your code.
[10:29:33] <beach> bollu: And comments like ";; then" and ";; else" just add noise.
[10:30:29] <beach> bollu: The number of blank lines between top-level forms seems completely arbitrary.  Use exactly one blank like, or none in exceptional cases.
[10:32:10] <beach> bollu: And you are misleading the person reading your code by having a function named ASSERT-EQ that then uses an equality predicate other than EQ.

[11:10:12] <ns12> remexre: What is SCL? Scieneer Common Lisp?
[11:10:46] <remexre> ns12: yeah...
[11:11:14] <ns12> Is it widely used?
[11:11:21] <phoe> not anymore
[11:12:23] <phoe> it's effectively dead - scieneer.com disappeared from the 'net
[11:13:51] <ns12> beach: "Your naming convention with -> is not conventional" - What is the convention for naming conversion functions?
[11:16:19] <beach> Well, these are not really conversion functions.  They are accessors.  And the best name for an accessor is the thing it returns like NAME for the name of an object, ADDRESS for an address of an object, etc.
[11:17:41] <jackdaniel> clx uses a->b, cffi uses a-to-b, the standard just specifies coerce and accessor like (STRING SOME-SYMBOL)
[11:17:55] <jackdaniel> s/coerce/COERCE/
[11:18:06] <jackdaniel> for conversion of course, as beach pointed out this is not really a conversion but a predicate
[11:18:36] <jackdaniel> the predicate name should be i.e EXPRESSION-CONSTANT-P (or in a form of an accessor)
[11:18:50] <ns12> Okay. Is it generally okay to use -> for conversion functions? For example, OBJ-A->OBJ-B.
[11:20:29] <jackdaniel> it is not unusual to see such function names; in LiSP author argues, that such functions should be named (OBJ-B<-OBJ-A ...) so the returned type is on the left (if I remember correctly)
[11:21:37] <semz> No CL standard function uses it to my knowledge, but you see them quite a bit, probably because Scheme uses them.
[11:22:02] <jackdaniel> well, standard doesn't have explicit conversion operators, except from the function COERCE
[11:22:28] <ns12> jackdaniel: Nowadays, does anyone follow the OBJ-B<-OBJ-A convention?

[11:22:39] <semz> parse-integer, kind of. Yes, I'm reaching.
[11:23:26] <jackdaniel> I wouldn't call it a convention, rather a recommendation. I'm sure someone does, but I don't know about such codebase myself
[11:23:30] *** Joins: amb007 (~a_bakic@162.39.22.93.rev.sfr.net)
[11:25:38] <ns12> What about the use of ! in the names of functions that mutate objects? Do Common Lisp programmers use ! like Scheme programmers do?
[11:26:35] <moon-child> conventionally they do not
[11:26:56] <jackdaniel> I saw it in a few libaries, but it is not common. a destructive version of FOO is NFOO (that's not the same as mutating, because you call them for the return value)
[11:27:02] <ns12> So how is mutation indicated? In the docstring?
[11:27:12] <jackdaniel> often it is indicated by a last letter f
[11:27:16] <jackdaniel> like (rotatef a b c)
[11:27:41] <moon-child> ns12: same way any other behaviour of the function is indicated
[11:27:44] <jackdaniel> or (maxf a 1 2 3) mind that the first argument is also taken into account for its value, not only as a storage place
[11:28:00] <moon-child> jackdaniel: I associate the letter f with a macro that mutates a place, not with a function
[11:28:08] *** Joins: lisp123 (~lisp123@5.30.23.247)
[11:28:55] <jackdaniel> sure, it is. I've assumed that we talk about operators
[11:29:17] <ns12> What is the meaning of "F"? Does it stand for anything?
[11:29:21] <jackdaniel> 'names of functions' may suggest otherwise, but organic  macros in scheme are underutilized so that's probably the cause that function comes to mind first
[11:29:29] <jackdaniel> MODIFY
[11:30:04] <jackdaniel> at leasts that's how I interpret it, I don't know how I came with this association
[11:30:36] <moon-child> apparently it's 'function'
[11:30:56] <jackdaniel> and, as for functions a usual name would be (setf foo)
[11:31:11] <jackdaniel> i.e (setf (name <object>) 'silly!)

[17:52:24] <theothornhill> Hey people! Does this look like a reasonable dsl for making a graphql server? I'd love some input, but here is a complete working graphql server (modulo networking) https://github.com/theothornhill/gql/blob/master/t/starwars/starwars-data.lisp

[17:57:02] <jackdaniel> where is the dsl?
[17:57:43] <theothornhill> well, it is the macros resembling defclasses.  Dsl might be the wrong term
[17:58:12] <jackdaniel> you mean defenum, definterface, defobject and defschema?
[17:59:12] <jackdaniel> is there a reason for defenum args not be a &body argument (instead of a list)
[17:59:41] <jackdaniel> re definterface and defobject, why are they not "normal" defclass arguments?
[17:59:48] <jackdaniel> s/arguments/forms/
[18:00:07] <jackdaniel> with possibly a different metaclass and slot metaclasses to accept other argument types
[18:00:29] <theothornhill> because they need to resolve into parsed objects, so that we both can use the js-like language and define our own
[18:00:53] <theothornhill> that's my thinking, at least
[18:00:55] *** Parts: thomaslewis (6e04fe5c02@mail.nobodyhasthe.biz) ()
[18:01:27] <jackdaniel> well, these are clearly lisp forms, you may serialize it and deserialize with anything, you don't work on characters but on objects right?
[18:02:10] <theothornhill> yeah, I construct an ast, and these macros create ast objects manually
[18:02:20] <theothornhill> not quite sure I understand what you mean
[18:03:23] <jackdaniel> you've said that you have some specific syntax so objects can resolve into parsed objects, did I get that worng?
[18:03:28] <jackdaniel> s/worng/wrong/?
[18:03:42] <theothornhill> no, that's correct
[18:04:15] <jackdaniel> so, what I'm saying is that it doesn't matter what syntax you use, because serializer and deserializer work on data that is already read

[18:12:09] <theothornhill> <3
[18:12:35] <theothornhill> yes, I don't really like that, but it might be better than changing the reader for casing?
[18:14:02] <rotateq> yes sure, for the ones that aren't all uppercase
[18:14:25] <theothornhill> true
[18:14:53] <jackdaniel> if this is about to expand to defclass then these would be slot names
[18:15:02] <jackdaniel> so perhaps (id :name "id" :type …)
[18:16:31] <jackdaniel> (home-planet :name "homePlanet" …) etc
[18:16:52] <theothornhill> They expand into other ast classes, for the time being at least
[18:19:44] <random-nick> you can avoid upcasing with ||

[20:53:49] <jackdaniel> (not not necessarily a keyword)
[20:54:14] <bollu> Hmm, then I don't understand what a symbol is. I thought a :symbol was some kind of flyweight object that's efficiently allocated, while 'symbol is .. something else (I'm not sure what)
[20:54:53] <jackdaniel> :foo is a symbol in the package keyword, these symbols are kind of special, because they evaluate to themselves

[20:56:12] <bollu> mm
[20:56:56] <bollu> I feel there is some inconsistency still. In the declaration of foo, I use [foo-field :initarg foo-initarg] while for bar, I use [bar-field :initarg :bar-initarg]. The [foo-initarg] is not a symbol. Why is this accepted?

[21:09:17] <bollu> okay, neat, thanks! I go back to fixing my shoddy lisp as per beach's feedback
[21:11:53] <beach> bollu: Also, really, I am serious by being careful with what you mean by "is".
[21:12:11] <beach> bollu: When the reader sees the sequence of characters 'hello, it does not return a symbol.
[21:12:39] <beach> bollu: It returns a list of two symbols: (QUOTE HELLO)
[21:13:32] <beach> bollu: So a more accurate statement than "is", would be "in a context of evaluation, the form 'hello evaluates to the symbol named HELLO".
[21:14:48] <bollu> beach the rephrasing is very helpful.
[21:14:51] <beach> bollu: The rest depends on the evaluation rules and some other things.  Like when the reader sees :hello, it returns the symbol named HELLO in the keyword package.  But as it turns out, when the evaluator sees a symbol in the keyword package, it returns the same symbol as a value.  That is not the case with other symbols.
[21:15:48] <phoe> ;; ...with *most* other symbols - some of them are defined to evaluate to themselves, most notably the constants T and NIL
[21:15:58] <beach> Right.
[21:16:41] <jackdaniel> (defvar phoe 'phoe)
[21:16:41] <phoe> ;; but keywords are the group of symbols for which this behavior is required - all it takes is interning a symbol in the KEYWORD package for that symbol to gain the magical properties of a keyword
[21:16:55] <phoe> also what jackdaniel just said

[21:17:18] <beach> bollu: So this is why, again in the context of evaluation, a symbol such as HELLO by itself evaluates to the value of HELLO as a variable, whereas a symbol such as :HELLO evaluates to itself.
[21:17:41] <jackdaniel> btw lately I find myself more often writing (function foo) in macro definitions (as contrated to function bodies) than #'foo
[21:17:54] <jackdaniel> it makes all that quoting and unquoting much less cryptic
[21:18:01] <jackdaniel> and (quote foo)

[21:55:55] <bollu> how do I compare classes for structural equality?
[21:56:07] <Xach> bollu: there is nothing built-in to do that.
[21:56:57] <bollu> Xach what are my options?
[21:57:08] <etimmons> Any Sly users know if there's a way to get an _inferior-lisp_ buffer like SLIME's? Sometimes I have messages printed before the mREPL starts that I want to see
[21:57:19] <bollu> Xach I'm trying to write an algorithm that needs persistence, so being able to write immutable style code and check structural equality would be very very useful
[21:59:37] <Xach> etimmons: https://github.com/xach/planetfeed
[21:59:37] <drakonis> etimmons: i skimmed your post about roswell and it reminds me a bit of how guix and nix operates
[22:00:03] <Xach> bollu: i'd look at joe marshall's posts about changesafe
[22:00:12] <etimmons> nvm, I found the inferior lisp buffer. For some reason wasn't showing up in my buffer list with C-x b 🤔
[22:00:14] <Xach> bollu: and kent pitman's "equal rights" article (i think that's the one)
[22:00:50] <bollu> Xach this? http://www.nhplace.com/kent/PS/EQUAL.html
[22:00:57] <bollu> and this? https://www.xach.com/lisp/changesafe.html
[22:01:26] <Xach> bollu: that's part of it. he blogged more details sometime in the past 10 years
[22:01:38] <bollu> Xach does it offer a solution? or perspective? ;)
[22:02:05] <Xach> bollu: perspective
[22:02:20] <bollu> Xach I am unsure that is what I need, if I need to implement algorithms that *need* persistence
[22:02:27] <bollu> but I shall read them nonetheless
[22:02:29] <bollu> thanks!

[22:04:59] <etimmons> Xach: and is http://planet.lisp.org/github.atom produced by https://github.com/xach/ghprojects ?
[22:06:04] <Xach> etimmons: oh, that's probably a better starting project
[22:06:13] <Xach> let me see if there are uncommitted bits
[22:07:27] <etimmons> drakonis: I should try guix and nix someday.
[22:09:00] <drakonis> they're pretty decent, but both have their share of oddities
[22:09:07] <bollu> I think I will move to defstruct over defclass
[22:09:09] <bollu> for my use-case
[22:09:22] <lisp123> bollu: stick with defclass
[22:09:25] <bollu> lisp123 :(
[22:09:30] <drakonis> i should try to reimplement either in cl as soon as i'm capable of
[22:09:32] <lisp123> :)
[22:09:33] <bollu> lisp123 I'll need to write equality compares by hand
[22:09:50] <lisp123> hmm
[22:09:52] <drakonis> guix is very good though
[22:10:23] <lisp123> i'll send you something
[22:10:58] <lisp123> https://plaster.tymoon.eu/view/2824#2824
[22:11:06] <lisp123> there should be a class equal function in there
[22:11:24] <drakonis> it improves on nix in a myriad of ways but retains some design decisions due to reusing the nix daemon
[22:11:25] <lisp123> Note this requires you load the CLOSER-MOP package from quicklisp
[22:11:56] <lisp123> Take the relevant bits from the file (e.g. the last line will not work)

[22:12:34] <Xach> etimmons: there *are* some uncommitted changes to ghprojects
[22:13:02] <jstoddard> drakonis: If you implement guix in CL, I'll gladly try it out.  I have been interested in trying out guix, but haven't gotten around to it.
[22:13:08] <Xach> etimmons: I'll see about pushing them later today
[22:13:35] <etimmons> drakonis: I bet I'd actually like it. IIUC, once you enter a guix environment it's basically like a fresh OS where everything is available with the standard names and so on. And I realized by biggest complaint about Roswell was it didn't do that
[22:14:08] <drakonis> i would like to reimplement shepherd in cl as well
[22:14:32] <etimmons> Xach: No rush, I don't have any time budgeted for it soon. Just going to idly look and think for a while
[22:14:36] <Xach> etimmons: have you seen djb's remarks about packagers?
[22:14:46] <etimmons> I don't think so
[22:15:17] <drakonis> then actually get rid of the dependency on the nix daemon so i can use the daemon for deployment, build scheduling and monitoring

[22:21:59] <drakonis> cl-tar is highly appreciated.
[22:23:21] <drakonis> i certainly wonder something now, if i have a sufficient amount of external libraries, how prone am i to breakage?
[22:23:39] <drakonis> especially libraries that aren't 1.0?
[22:25:21] <etimmons> drakonis: Somewhat. I think most CL projects do a good job about not breaking things, but breakage does happen occasionally.

[22:25:35] <drakonis> jstoddard: it is worthwhile to try it out, if i actually finished the prototype, it'll look a lot like guix
[22:25:57] <etimmons> Frequent CI runs help (not just when you push, but also periodic to get updates from your deps)
[22:26:13] <drakonis> before actually engaging into a total makeover
[22:26:50] <etimmons> And if you add your project to QL, Xach will let you know if your project fails to build due to a dep change. But I don't think he runs tests, just compiles
[22:27:19] <drakonis> tbf, guix and nix have CIs for their package ecosystem
[22:27:36] <drakonis> so that gets avoided
[22:28:06] <drakonis> lots of package pinning is done to avoid breakage due to upstream updating
[22:28:13] <drakonis> it is fascinating
[22:28:24] <etimmons> And there are other approaches as well, like CLPM and Qlot that let you create pinned environments.
[22:28:58] <etimmons> But if you go that route, you definitely want to have your CI occasionally bump your deps so you don't get too far behind
[22:30:29] <drakonis> yeah.
[22:30:41] <drakonis> that's the same approach
[22:31:35] <etimmons> (shameless-self plug): I do have Gitlab CI scripts for CLPM that will automatically bump your deps and open an MR. That then triggers your regular CI tests so you can see if there was breakage
[22:31:45] <drakonis> i do want an escape hatch for ignoring pinning
[22:32:16] <drakonis> since guix does not provide it the easy way
[22:32:32] <drakonis> nix has it hidden under layers of indirection and code
[22:32:38] <drakonis> brb
[22:33:14] <etimmons> drakonis: That's pretty easy to do. pining is typically done with a separate file and requires no modification to an .asd file. So just ignore the extra file and load the system however you want to
[22:33:45] <etimmons> * pinning
[22:35:22] *** Quits: igemnace (~ian@user/igemnace) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[22:39:49] <etimmons> As a concrete example, I use CLPM to manage my dev and testing env for cl-tar. But it'll still work via QL (once the next dist hits) or just dropping it onto your ASDF source registry.
[22:41:32] <drakonis> not going to make it cl specific tho, as it would defeat the point of the rewrite

[22:46:40] <lisp123> Quick one, is there a version of loop that collects for a vector not a list?
[22:47:15] <etimmons> (and trying to convince myself I'm not one of those integrators that introduces incompatibilities to lock users in :P)
[22:47:27] <aeth> lisp123: no, but depending on what you're doing, you can use MAP or MAP-INTO instead
[22:47:36] <aeth> (i.e. if you can write the iteration as a lambda)

[22:48:12] <lisp123> "MAPV"
[22:48:49] <aeth> that's basically what MAP is when the second argument isn't NIL or 'list afaik
[22:49:10] <aeth> it's just that there are a lot of different kinds of vectors
[22:49:27] <aeth> maybe MAPSV if you're going for a 'simple-vector
[22:51:12] <lisp123> good point re different kinds of vectors
[22:51:41] <lisp123> I guess that's why MAP requires the sequence type to be specified
[22:51:48] <lisp123> ehh maybe I just use lists again lol
