[01:20:10] <PerfDave> And cause so many others :)
[01:20:13] <somiaj> Not really, but this is a way that one can backport the buildchain for firefox-esr to stable and oldstable without breaking all the other things that build with rust
[01:20:22] *** Quits: remote (~self@user/hackers) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[01:20:51] <somiaj> really, I wish firefox-esr would actually make a more stable release that doesn't require the newest buildchain to build. But upstream cares not about older distros.
[01:21:04] <xx> PerfDave: would it? It would completely elimiate the issue where one package upgrade breaks a different package that shared the dependencies.
[01:21:57] <somiaj> Though in genral stable should not be updating packages like that. firefox-esr is an exception because browsers suck
[01:22:43] <cosimone> i have a question: why is it not possible to install both emacs-gtk and emacs-lucid on the same system? shouldn't something like update-alternatives be able to let them coexist?
[01:22:49] <xx> browsers suck indeed, but firefox at least makes and esr version, and the timeline was known well before debian bullseye release, so the maintainer should have made it work

[01:23:38] <xx> isn't the mozilla team in debian paid by canonical?
[01:24:30] <somiaj> canonical just avoides this whole issue by using snaps and pushing the responnability back upstream, which update themselves whenever they feel like it
[01:24:59] <PerfDave> xx: There are plenty of distributions and operating systems which adopt the approach you're suggesting here, and they have their own problems as well as their own advantages :)
[01:24:59] <xx> anyway, I didn't want to start a whole discussion on this, I just needed some bug numbers to bookmark
[01:25:01] <somiaj> cosimone: Could be various reasons, one being the work to rename all the binaries so they can install side by side. You may be able to check via the bug reports if this has been atempted.
[01:25:18] <xx> PerfDave: but they are not debian :(
[01:25:34] <PerfDave> xx: And if Debian went down that path, it wouldn't be Debian any more either.
[01:25:48] <somiaj> cosimone: I don't have an answer, my guess is a combation of work vs gain, and this would also require extra work each and every emacs update, for a gain that not many would use.
[01:25:54] <xx> PerfDave: imo debian is the dfsg, and this would not affect that

[01:27:16] <PerfDave> No, it's like the people who say that Fedora Blue isn't Fedora any more because it's not an operating system distribution, it's a platform to run Flatpaks on.
[01:28:03] <xx> flatpaks are nice, pity it doesn't really support cli apps
[01:28:13] <xx> I'd love to have a flatpak of newer bash
[01:28:56] <xx> (I kinda do already, but it is extra jumps)
[01:28:58] <Khepra> why doesn't flatpak support cli?
[01:29:00] <PerfDave> Literally the point of a distro is that it is a distribution of software which attempts to work consistently together. If you want instead something which is a bunch of applications, each bundled with its own dependencies, that may have advantages and disadvantages but it's not really a distribution IMHO.
[01:29:17] <xx> Khepra: by their decision, flatpak is for GUI stuff
[01:29:26] <Khepra> huh. advantage snaps, then.
[01:29:27] <xx> there's no technical limitation
[01:29:52] <Khepra> PerfDave: theory is usually far from reality
[01:30:05] <xx> also, I kinda use flatpak and flathub interchangeably
[01:30:49] <Khepra> xx: just scrolled up, what solution for firefox-esr?
[01:31:05] <Khepra> did the maintainers make a decision for the future of the package?
[01:31:06] <xx> Khepra: create a new package of rustc with different name
[01:31:11] <Khepra> oh
[01:31:19] <xx> so effectively there will be two separate rustc packages on the system
[01:31:29] <Khepra> spaghetti. what could possibly go wrong :)
[01:31:44] <xx> a few other packages seem to be getting this treatment too
[01:31:44] <Khepra> so instead of one poorly maintained rust, there will now be two :)
[01:31:52] <PerfDave> Khepra: The difference between theory and practice is that in theory there is no difference ;)
[01:31:53] <greycat> Compiling your own bash and dropping it in /usr/local/bin/ is not hard at all.
[01:31:54] <somiaj> Khepra: the issue was they needed to find a way to backport rustc and llvm to stable and oldstable, but since other things depend on rustc and llvm, they opted to create a new set of packaes to backport the build change with, rustc-mozilla, llvm-mozilla
[01:32:18] <somiaj> basically they were afraid of breaking one of the 500+ packages that use rustc to build in stable
[01:32:29] <Khepra> right. rings a bell too, methinks this is not the first time something like this has been done
[01:32:29] <xx> greycat: but that's effort that's best done by someone other than me, so that I can just automatically consume the end result on `apt upgrade` or similar
[01:33:00] <xx> like, I *can* do it, but I'd much rather someone who knows more than me does it
[01:33:03] <PerfDave> xx: Ask for bash to be added to debian backports?
[01:33:03] <greycat> How many bash features from the development tree are you actually using, which are not in the bash 5.1 release?  Which is also the newest upstream release.
[01:33:31] <Khepra> PerfDave: nice pun is nice :)
[01:34:05] <greycat> And yeah, baskports is perfect for that, if it ever becomes an issue (e.g. if bash 5.2 is released before bookworm).

[12:25:25] <somiaj> Wonder if using/adapting fasttrack could help improve this

[12:25:51] <xx> chromium for sure is another candidate
[12:25:56] <somiaj> xx: more just about debian policy in general and how it hinders things, and maybe Debian should examine it a bit
[12:26:40] <xx> it indeed is a bit odd, since it is *trivial* to create a sid chroot on debian stable and compile stuff in there

[12:26:41] <somiaj> chromium isn't really in the same boat as firefox-esr, chromium has 1-2 maintainers and they aren't currently active
[12:27:27] <somiaj> I suspect chromium to be dropped from debian altogether just due to lack of a team of maintainers.
[12:27:28] <xx> well, I could maintain it, if it just meant "build chromium from source and upload it somewhere" and I wouldn't have to deal with bugreports (I'd just say "report it upstream")
[12:28:10] <xx> the only annoying thing is that it takes me over a day to build it

[12:29:29] <somiaj> I think it is a little more complicated than just building the binary in a sid chroot, as that binary may not run in bullseye, but one doesn't need to backport the full build chain first, but create a build enviorment which uses bullseye libaries with a newer rustc build chain
[12:29:49] <somiaj> There is also the additional complication of ensuring it builds on multiple arches.
[12:29:54] <xx> chromium is pretty self-contained, a version built in sid will work in stable
[12:30:32] <somiaj> the list of shared libararies it uses seems to suggest otherwise.
[12:30:45] <xx> doesn't crash though
[12:31:22] <jelly> you need a reproducible build env.  You could say snapshot.d.o of sid from date YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS for build tools, and non-vendored deps from bullseye

Since a few days it refuses to connect to eg. https://github.com : insecure connection: NET::ERR_CERT_INVALID ; Certificate is invalid but I do not see why. Chromium on my office systems is able to show that page. Both Debian 9 latest updates. How-to debug this?   curl and openssl connect are fine with the certificates.

[15:42:13] <dpkg> The Debian Live project provides pre-built Debian live system images and allows creation of your own. These can be used to install a Debian system (although the installer is better to use). Live images are available from http://www.debian.org/CD/live/ . https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-live/ #debian-live on irc.debian.org. See also <live firmware>. <UEFI> mode is supported by Debian Live images.

[22:32:28] <maxzor> and the object of the RFP is to not depend on the amdgpu-pro installer anymore
[22:36:37] <XileX> AMD installer failed installing dkms stuff and I tried to find any guides for installing rocm properly, but did not find anything
[22:37:34] <sney> maxzor: maybe you should cc the debian opencl team, since this is likely to be relevant to them - pkg-opencl-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org
[22:37:36] <maxzor> I had trouble with dkms on linux not having linux-headers

[22:38:20] <sney> having an actual debian package would certainly streamline the process.
[22:38:30] <maxzor> sney, right, in amdgpu-pro there are amdgpu-opencl packages

[22:43:11] <sudorm> hi, where is the official documentation for systemd?
[22:43:26] <sudorm> i.e. the full doc for .service files and every possible option?
[22:43:45] <maxzor> opencl is mostly supported by mesa and amdgpu. There are bits I have been told that require the amd-made packages
[22:43:46] <sudorm> also how to find which service depends on what else?
[22:44:31] <sudorm> all i found is blog posts on freedesktop.org such as https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/

[22:47:07] <sudorm> XileX, thanks. For example, how to find the doc to know what "paths.target" is?
[22:47:17] <maxzor> There is this guy with a ITP package? https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=961006

[22:47:21] <sudorm> also where is a list of all options possible in a .service config file?

[22:53:47] <sudorm> is there a command-line tool to test if a service is waiting for another target? and to see dependencies more precisely?
[22:54:04] <sudorm> something like systemd-analyze blame, systemd-analyze plot, but more precise

[22:59:41] <jmcnaught> sudorm: it's a systemd.slice(5) unit that contains system services.  See also systemd.special(7).
[23:00:15] <jmcnaught> sudorm: default dependencies are discussed in systemd.unit(5) and the man page for each type of unit like systemd.service(5)
[23:00:42] <sudorm> thanks! I read https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.slice.html => systemd.slice(5)  but this is rather vague
[23:01:09] <sudorm> "A unit configuration file whose name ends in ".slice" encodes information about a slice unit. A slice unit is a concept for hierarchically managing resources of a group of processes.". What is covered by the specific slice "system.slice"?

[23:44:44] <jmcnaught> sudorm: do not go removing or changing units in /lib/systemd/system though, as package updates will overwrite any changes there
