[14:53:05] <ychaouche> Hey ##email gurus
[14:53:22] <ychaouche> How do I lookup my adresse in zen.spamhaus.org, can I do that via dig ? 
[14:53:33] <ychaouche> it seems that domain doesn't exit or something
[14:54:30] <ychaouche> it's confusing. host on zen.spamhaus.org doesn't return anything, instead of NXDOMAIN.
[14:55:11] <bremner> maybe using a program like "rblcheck" would be simplest
[14:56:20] <ychaouche> thanks for the nice tip
[14:59:02] <ychaouche> ah, I need to reverse the IP and query it as a subdomain of zen.spamhaus.org
[14:59:17] <ychaouche> dig reverse.ip.zen.spamhaus.org
[15:01:10] <bremner> good to know. I knew the reverse part (from the rblcheck manpage) but not the domain
[15:13:36] <ychaouche> an example usage is given here : https://genius.it/25090201/www.spamhaus.org/faq/section/DNSBL%20Usage

[17:50:28] * rob0 doesn't want anyone to know how bald he is
[17:53:32] <ychaouche> no worries, it only has 8 views
[17:53:36] * ychaouche posts it on reddit
[18:00:55] <ychaouche> I wouldn't have thought that e-mail server associated work is scarce, especially in the US

[18:01:16] <ychaouche> I guess now it's worse with all the kubernetes stuff
