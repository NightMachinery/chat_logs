[00:00:11] <one-star-chef> The Deepl has been mentioned here. I didn't know the Deepl until now. Funny, right? Can Deepl translate the whole webpage (e. g. the Wikipedia article) like Google translate can? I am trying to do this but no luck yet, hence my question. I'd like to know if it is simply not possible or if I am doing something wrong.
[00:01:35] <brigand> one-star-chef: I don't think Deepl does that. Maybe with a paid account.
[00:01:54] <TimMc> The etymology of "syndrome" is something like "runs together", so a medical syndrome is a collection of symptoms that are observed to sometimes cluster in a certain way. So now "syndrome" basically means "ailment".

[02:26:21] <mdogg> The more you listen to the way people speak the easier it becomes, though.

[07:27:48] <mdogg> The Choir of King's College in Cambridge was founded in 1441 by King Henry VI to provide daily singing in his Chapel, which remains the main task of this choir to this day.  Becoming a member of this choir is extremely difficult - only those with the most exceptional voices are admitted.  This is one of my favorite Christmas hymns -- https://www.mdogg.com/mdogg/temp/Christmas/Kings-College-Choir_O-Holy-Night_HD.mp4
[07:31:08] * Panther is hoping to be a FM DJ next year.
[07:32:30] <Panther> Henry VI likely didn't set anything up for that like for the chior.
[07:38:32] <mdogg> That choir predates FM and I reckon will outlast it.  
[07:41:53] <mdogg> Actually, let me rephrase that -- Frequency Modulation has always been around but it has only been relevant for a few decades.  The King's College Choir has been relevant for centuries and I am positive that it will continue to be relevant long after the concept of FM is dead.

[20:55:08] <twb> "Do you want [me] to fix your Japanese sentence[s] when you [use it] wrong?"  where "it" means "the Japanese language" rather than "your Japanese sentences"
