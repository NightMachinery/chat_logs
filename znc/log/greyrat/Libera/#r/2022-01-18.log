[00:14:42] <Bayes> fair enough
[00:14:59] <Bayes> I'm checking the lower level plotting functions, plot.new plot.window etc

[02:29:28] <Bayes> if you run the bottom lines one by one, you'll get the gist of it
[02:29:47] <Bayes> but basically it starts from mar = rep(.1, 4) and starts adding margins as needed
[02:30:46] <Bayes> and it gets wrapped around plot so you just change from plot(blabla) to plot_wrapper(blabla) and that's it
[02:30:58] <Bayes> it doesn't always get it right but it's a prototype I guess

[10:20:16] <__that__> Morning
[10:21:02] <__that__> why the heck is R coercing the values of my dataframe columns into string when they are of integer datatype? I am just doing my_dataframe$my_column
[10:21:38] <__that__> when I print the dataframe I don't see quotes around the numbers
[10:22:57] <__that__> I just want to extract the data stored in that column as a vector. There must be a way of doing this
[10:50:15] <__that__> hold on a minute. Does R's global variables defined in the console while testing make them available into the script you are running above? it happens that in one of my functions I was calling the outer definition rather than the local one to the function
[10:50:20] <__that__> R didn't complain

[11:11:45] <__that__> The problem is that column of integers are return as a vector os integers but real numbers are coerced back to strings
[11:11:55] <__that__> does anyone know why this happens please?
[11:13:21] <__that__> I see... str reveals that those columns are indeed strings. 
[11:13:50] <__that__> I was printing the dataframe only
[11:18:02] <__that__> real numbers somehow get read as strings By R
[11:22:27] <Guest78> what?
[11:23:36] <__that__> nahhhh. I understand why. There is a subheading in each column that has got an string in it. Because R stores each column data as a vector, it has to convert the entire column to strings. The person who wrote the code didn't care... obviously
[11:23:56] <__that__> so I will read numbers only and then add the column names later
[11:24:50] <Guest78> like if you data has column heading there is often "head=TRUE" option with read.table,...
[11:25:36] <__that__> Guest78, there is heading, subheanding, value1, .... valueN. I just want the heading and values, not the subheadings with the values as numeric, obviously
[11:27:01] <Guest78> ok. you can read them seperately and combine the two later. real data is terrible with fancy headers
[11:27:39] <__that__> yeah, I was imagining
[11:29:51] <Guest78> or read like you did and drop rows of subheadings before casting "wrongly" typed columns
[11:30:48] <__that__> but then I would need to explicitly cast some column names and I'd like to avoid that

[11:34:52] <Guest78> ok. you will still need to cast some strings to factors anyway?
[11:36:01] <Guest78> but you might be dealing with thousand columns so it will be impractical
[11:43:10] <__that__> the other thing is how can I avoid Rstudio to continuously install my packages every time I run a script that has got an install.packages on it? is there any sort if exist doesn't install or similar
[11:43:16] <__that__> or what's the best practise?
[11:45:08] *** Joins: debianero (~debianero@60.132.134.77.rev.sfr.net)
[11:45:29] <Guest78> you can check if the packages are not already first then install. so, some condition on install.packages(). otherwise, don't use install.packages() if you have to share your work. it could fail on someone's system...

[11:46:56] <Guest78> like tidyverse packages have extreme dependencies that often includes system libraries, so they always fail the first time

[11:55:51] <__that__> Right, coming from other languages R is such a mess to be honest
[11:56:18] <__that__> I guess that once you get to its tedious grammar you can realise its power but what a messy language it is

[20:24:18] <Bayes> here's a good example on how to put all your code in one single file https://github.com/cran/mvbutils/blob/master/R/mvbutils.R
[20:25:11] <rickyrick> lol/10
[20:25:30] <Bayes> rickyrick that doesn't work really cause I want to show that two different models (rows) produce similar patterns across two different data sets (columns)
[20:25:42] <rickyrick> ya idk then
[20:25:46] <Bayes> and they're easier to compare if they're one below the other I guess
[20:25:47] <rickyrick> Switch to ggplot2 :^)
[20:25:54] <Bayes> that's ggplot2
[20:26:00] <rickyrick> Use cowplot then

[20:35:48] <Bayes> but since I tend to prefer many small files instead, I'm not a huge user of folding and code focusing

[20:40:47] <Bayes> rickyrick with R not having macros and favoring functions, I guessed that was the most R-y approach ?
