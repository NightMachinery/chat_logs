[10:46:55] <jmercouris> interesting I see mariari
[10:46:58] <jmercouris> I know what is wrong
[10:47:04] <jmercouris> you are unable to compile the extensions
[10:47:11] <jmercouris> support that was just added in
[10:47:35] <jmercouris> I don't know if this is because you are missing libraries, running a different cc etc
[10:48:09] <jmercouris> you can compile without using the makefile, and it should be fine
[10:48:20] <jmercouris> just do a (asdf:make :nyxt/gi-gtk) in a SBCL REPL
[10:48:24] <jmercouris> there's no need to use the makefile

[13:33:03] <aartaka> edgarvincent[m]: Right now the way aroung this is to go to libraries/web-extensions and run make all (of course, given that you have webkit and gobject-introspection libraries and headers installed).
[13:42:05] <aartaka> edgarvincent[m]: I just pushed the error printing for our pkg-config calls. Now it should output what's wrong to the console.

[21:05:04] <drakonis> jmercouris: have you ever thought about nix/guix in common lisp?
[21:05:37] <drakonis> not sure why i went and pinged you there buuut
[21:07:15] <edgarvincent[m]> The web-extensions library builds with this in its makefile: `LDLIBS += ${shell pkg-config ${PKG_MODULES} --libs --maximum-traverse-depth 2}`, but I don't know if that's how it's supposed to be built.
[21:20:09] <aartaka> edgarvincent[m]: Wow, that's been a hell of an investigation for you, I guess :)
[21:20:14] <aartaka> Care to send a PR?
[21:21:12] <edgarvincent[m]> aartaka: It has, especially knowing that I know very little about Makefiles, and hadn't even heard about pkg-config before today ^^
[21:21:52] <aartaka> edgarvincent[m]: Yeah, neither did I until I started the WebExtensions lubrary :D
[21:21:53] <edgarvincent[m]> I don't know whether my solution is suitable though.
[21:22:01] <edgarvincent[m]> haha
[21:23:13] <aartaka> edgarvincent[m]: If Beastify works fine (tee the WebExtensions PR for testing instructions), it should be fine.
[21:23:19] <aartaka> *see
[21:24:20] <edgarvincent[m]> With `--maximum-traverse-depth 2`, pkg-config doesn't look into the dependencies' dependencies.
