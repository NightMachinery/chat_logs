[13:17:55] <emanuele6> i wrote a solution for today's part1 ( https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/6 ) inspired by that page on unix pipes you sent some months ago

[13:21:18] <earnest> While this is recursive fork/exec
[13:21:23] <emanuele6> i have been running that code with n=256 and "3,4,3,1,2" as input for almost 15 minutes and i am still not getting any response
[13:21:33] <earnest> Buffering?
[13:21:44] <emanuele6> no, it is just a lot to compute i think
[13:21:51] <emanuele6> it is exponential
[13:22:06] <earnest> But you should see something for the first few
[13:22:26] <emanuele6> no, the only thing that prints to the terminal is the last command
[13:22:41] <emanuele6> that only prints the result at the end
[13:23:36] <earnest> Yeah I see that now
[13:23:52] <earnest> This is a brutal command
[13:24:23] <earnest> Anything that is recursive, or tight for loops, executing stuff repeatidly is harsh
[13:24:32] <emanuele6> yeah, it works quite fast for n=80, but exponentials are brutal
[13:25:18] <emanuele6> this does not spawn more than n+1 processes, once the pipeline is set up, there are no more fork()/exec()
[13:26:20] <earnest> There is a fork/exec for every pipeline object, which there is many
[13:26:59] <emanuele6> huh?
[13:28:14] <emanuele6> for the shells? yes, it does that only once and the pipeline has been set up for a lot of time
[13:29:04] <emanuele6> now what is taking time are the read()/write()s
[13:29:32] <emanuele6> if you think   x | y   z | y   spawns y two times, that is not how it works in awk
[13:29:43] <emanuele6> y is the same y
[13:30:25] <emanuele6> ( read()/write()s and the awks processing the data )

[13:34:55] <emanuele6> ( spoilers: http://0x0.st/-hGd.png ) it has been running like this for almost 30 minutes hahaha
[13:35:16] <emanuele6> and this is just the example with 5 initial fish, not the real input
[13:36:38] <seninha> emanuele6: second part cannot be bruteforced in a feasible time
[13:37:11] <emanuele6> ( spoilers: http://0x0.st/-hGy.txt ) this is what i am using
[13:37:38] <OMGOMG> what is it with this language and attracting perverts
[13:38:42] <seninha> OMGOMG wat?
[13:39:03] <seninha> emanuele6: why are you recursively forking your script?
[13:39:28] <emanuele6> it is just setting up the pipeline
[13:41:44] <OMGOMG> seninha: emanuele6's script, not yours. yours was sweet and elegant
[13:42:14] <seninha> there's no need to do that, that's CPU waste. You can do what you're doing with recursive functions.
[13:42:29] <seninha> Actually, there's no need for recursion for this puzzle.
[13:43:11] <emanuele6> i stopped it, it has been running 35minutes on the example and didn't finish 
[13:46:49] <emanuele6> seninha: i know, i don't need it recursion
[13:47:31] <emanuele6> seninha: i read this page some months ago in bash https://swtch.com/~rsc/thread/ and i thought this was a good opportunity to try that approach in practice
[13:48:04] <emanuele6> s/it rec/rec/
[13:48:14] <emanuele6> s/bash/#&/
[13:49:31] <emanuele6> the BEGIN{} stuff does not really affect the performance of the program, i could have done the same manually by using `awk ..|awk ..|awk ..|awk ..' in a shell script, it simply sets up the pipeline
[13:50:56] <seninha> I see
[13:52:07] <seninha> btw, if you need help with todays puzzle, you can ask me
[13:59:52] <emanuele6> thank you
[14:05:22] <Patsie> work interrupted my upload of day06, but here it is -> https://github.com/patsie75/aoc/tree/main/2021
[14:05:24] <emanuele6> i just tried the solution i had in mind before starting to play with pipes and it worked :) ( spoiler: https://0x0.st/-hDH.txt )
[14:07:43] <seninha> I'd suggest you an array rotation: [spoiler] https://0x0.st/-hDz.bin [/spoiler]

[21:55:36] <e36freak> i guess it works
[21:56:27] <user51> why not?
[21:58:18] <seninha> You could set RS = ""; FS = "," at BEGIN and FS = " " when NR == 1
[21:58:51] <seninha> Then you will have fields delimited by , and \n on NR == 1 and delimited by " " and \n when NR > 1
