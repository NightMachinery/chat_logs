[20:47:13] <Kabouik> Does the preview-mode still work for you? I'm trying to edit a reveal.js html file and Nyxt doesn't pick up the changes when I save the file.
[20:48:24] <jmercouris> Kabouik: I’ll have to retest

[20:50:53] <Kabouik> I can only confirm it does nothing for me at the moment, but it used to. Not sure when this started, or if it's related to the file
[20:52:41] <Kabouik> Doesn't seem to be related to my nyxt config at least, same with nyxt -I
[20:53:11] <Kabouik> I have to go, can't investigate more right now, but I'll be back *suspensful music*

[21:52:15] <pedro-delfino> Why?

[23:12:03] <lagash> pedro-delfino: I don't mean to be insulting, it's just that the flow seemed a bit jarring
[23:12:56] <jmercouris> Hm similar feedback from Pierre about some things
[23:13:09] <jmercouris> Indeed it is a bit hard to tie these concepts into a nice narrative
[23:13:21] <jmercouris> Hence your perception that things are jarring
[23:26:29] <drakonis> jmercouris: perhaps renaming the org file to something else
[23:26:48] <drakonis> as the name is a bit clickbait-y?
[23:28:32] <jmercouris> drakonis: such as?
[23:29:00] <drakonis> to the same name the title of the post
[23:29:17] <jmercouris> hm
[23:29:19] <jmercouris> it could be done

[23:45:18] <drakonis> quick question, how will the editor parts look like?
