[02:29:32] <thumbs> dfee: there you are
[02:32:33] <tabakhase> dfee thats normal - container-to-container doesnt use published ports - you stick them tgether into a named network, then they can resolve another "by name" and you can use the internal port as they talk directly 
[02:34:17] <tabakhase> if those are "unrelated things" - say hooking your one db/traefik up to 3 different projects - you set a explicit "name:" on that network, and declare it as external: true on the "childs"

[02:38:08] <dfee> i do `docker compose up`. i can `curl` it from the host: `curl localhost:8080`, but if i stand up another container: `docker compose run nginx bash`, i get "connection refused" when attempting a curl.

[02:43:24] <notevil> localhost in the container points to the container itself, not the host.  use the host ip.  or better, use the networking options mentioned.
[02:44:42] <dfee> yes, to be explicit, this fails: `curl nginx:8080`
[02:45:00] <dfee> where `nginx` is an entry in `/etc/hosts/`
[02:45:04] <dfee> (oops, a file not a dir`
[02:47:00] <notevil> the networking options would allow nginx to work, assuming that's the name of the service.  docker has a dns service that handles service names without changing /etc/hosts.  (and it handles when the service restarts and possibly gets different ip, etc.)
[02:47:39] <dfee> yeah, i'm not updating `/etc/hosts`, i'm assuming that's set by docker on boot
[02:48:20] <dfee> so, if you think i should be able to access it, and i can't... how can i debug this?
[02:48:38] <notevil> no, docker provides dns server. 127.0.0.11 if I remember correctly.  just for containers.
[02:49:10] <notevil> use the host ip (not the 127.0.0.1 ip).  that should work.  
[02:50:06] <dfee> from the "docker compose run" docker container, i need to specify the host ip?
[02:50:42] <notevil> the one that you run curl from.  `curl hostip:8080`
[02:52:24] <tabakhase> dfee internal ports, so curl nginx:80
[02:53:05] <dfee> hmmm. ok, so it looks like `dummy:80` works.

[03:58:58] <luva> is it the same as cpu share where, if the host has enough resources it allows more, but if there is other tasks of other containers for example, it limits it to 50% like it is with the cpu-shares in compose 2

[05:34:24] <luva> tianon, is it the same like for cpu_shares that if there is no load it can go higher than 50 % utilization or is it a hard cap?
[05:35:08] <tianon> it's a hard cap - it's really shorthand for setting cpu-period + cpu-quota
[05:35:52] <tianon> where the ratio between the two numbers is the value you set
[05:36:57] *** Quits: tsal (~tsal@user/tsal) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[05:37:12] <tianon> ie, --cpus 0.5 might be something like a period of 100 and a quota of 50 (although I think the period value it bases on is higher like maybe 1000 or even more)
[05:38:37] <tianon> ah 50000 vs 100000
[05:39:28] <tianon> so a value like 2.0 would flip that, 200000 vs 100000 meaning two full cores worth of CPU (hard cap)
[05:39:42] <tianon> but can be evenly spread across all cores, unlike cpuset

[17:01:30] <davu> I would assume 3.9 != 3.9.12

[17:03:53] <burakcank> 3-management tag could be upgraded to 3.10 or 3.11, but "management" tag can even be upgraded to 4 at some point.
[17:03:53] <davu> I might get you wrong though ;)
[17:04:22] <burakcank> did I understand correct ?
[17:04:32] <lenarhoyt> burakcank: i would assume it is always X.latest. if 3.9.12 is the latest, then 3.9=3.9.12
[17:04:46] <davu> Not sure. I've always seen those numberings as a version number for their specific releases
[17:05:26] <burakcank> lenarhoyt: yeah so I am right in what I said previously
[17:05:50] <davu> I would think more that 3.9-management is 3.9.0-management, just as there's no dot-release as 3.9 was initially released. But as said. I might be wrong
[17:06:23] <burakcank> "management" tag could be bumped to v4.0 when the time comes, but if you are using "3-management" it won't be bumped.

[18:22:07] <programmerq> davu▸ most image authors that use that scheme, including the docker hub official image library, will have a 3.9 tag that points to the latest 3.9.x tag. So if the latest is 3.9.12, 3.9 and 3.9.12 will be the same. If the image authors push up a 3.9.13 release, they'll point the 3.9 tag to 3.9.13 and the 3.9.12 tag will still by around. For an end user perspective, I can point my compose file or
[18:22:10] <programmerq> whatever to 3.9 and any time I rerun 'docker-compose --pull up -d', it'll get me the latest patch release for 3.9.x but I'll have to manually change my compose file if I want a 4.x release, for example.

[19:16:15] <programmerq> gebbione▸ docker-compose logs -f will only grab logs of existing containers. starting a new one via 'docker-compose run' will not cause the existing instance of the 'docker-compose logs' command to discover and start following the new container.

[21:07:02] <kittonian> hi all. when using an env file, you still put in the double quotes where necessary but you do not put in the single quotes correct?
[21:08:25] <ikke> What do you mean with put in the singel quotes
[21:08:27] <ikke> ?
[21:10:04] <kittonian> if the line hardcoded in the docker-compose file would be gitlab_rails['gitlab_email_from'] = 'gitlab@mydomain.de'
[21:10:23] <kittonian> you would change that to read gitlab_rails['gitlab_email_from']=${GITLAB_EMAIL_FROM}
[21:10:42] <kittonian> and then in the .env file it would be GITLAB_EMAIL_FROM=gitlab@mydomain.de
[21:11:02] <kittonian> but if the line hardcoded would be gitlab_rails['smtp_address'] = "mail.mydomain.de"
[21:11:08] <ikke> You stell need those quotes
[21:11:34] <kittonian> you do? i thought you didn't do that anymore

[21:41:50] <kittonian> it think it might have to do with the fact that gitlab is expecting some of these variables to be encased in double quotes and since the .env file automatically places single quotes around the variables it ends up as '"blah"'

[23:36:30] <ivii> here is dockerfile https://pastebin.com/QpcVXkbN
[23:41:59] <notevil> is there already a database init in /var/lib/mysql?  the initdb scripts are only called on startup when there's no db files setup.
[23:42:38] <ivii> Ah yes, I mount /var/lib/mysql volume to save databases
