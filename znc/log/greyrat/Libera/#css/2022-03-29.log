[01:28:48] <DPA> Looks like firefox-esr fails to figure out the correct element I click at or select text on for some of the more deeply nested structures...
[01:31:08] <DPA> It's probably because of the display: flow-root; I'm using. I need a line break, like a display:block has, but I need margins to be contained in the element, like with a display:inline-block;   display:flow-root; seems to do that, but also seams not to be implemented all that well.

[05:33:18] <FunkyBob> this is the evidence

[06:21:26] <jargon> It’s still using a table and doesn’t wrap around.
[06:40:31] <FunkyBob> well, first question is... _is_ that how you want it to work?
[06:40:34] <FunkyBob> wrapping around like that

[07:51:31] <FunkyBob> and why are you so obsessed with abusing a table for this?

[08:06:10] <funnybunny> Hello, I have the following http://jsfiddle.net/gs2pzkjw/1 and I was wondering how I can make the second line width shorter so that "ABC" doesn't overlap "..."
[08:07:09] <FunkyBob> you want #b to make space for #c?
[08:08:29] <FunkyBob> funnybunny: ?
[08:09:41] <funnybunny> Yes
[08:10:04] <jargon> Yes, FunkyBob, I would like two columns.
[08:10:16] <jargon> And yes, I removed the tables.
[08:10:30] <funnybunny> I could change the width of b, but I would like to allow b to be long on the first line and shorter on the second line if possible

[08:11:24] <FunkyBob> jargon: before you said you wanted it to flow... have you changed your mind now?

[08:14:55] <jargon> vs. https://imgur.com/vSBJVgv
[08:15:19] <FunkyBob> jargon: so... you want more padding in each nav item?
[08:15:23] <FunkyBob> is that what you're saying?
[08:15:25] <jargon> Yes.
[08:15:39] <FunkyBob> (but y ou're happy with them all being on different lines now... unlike your original and my example?)
[08:15:50] <FunkyBob> "them all" meaning the image, label, and count
[08:16:45] <jargon> FunkyBob, I am referring to the part on the right.
[08:17:38] <FunkyBob> ok... so far I've only been talking about the nav stuff
[08:17:53] <jargon> I am referring to the mostrecent page data.
[08:18:07] <jargon> literally “Most Recent”
[08:18:24] <FunkyBob> the 3rd nav item?
[08:18:36] <jargon> No the page on the right that nav goes to.
[08:19:00] <FunkyBob> ...
[08:19:01] <funnybunny> FunkyBob: Any suggestions for doing something different
[08:19:54] <FunkyBob> funnybunny: I was trying to think of how you might do it with a float... just not sure how to make it position so the line goes above it
[08:20:10] <FunkyBob> jargon: and... when did you start talking about that?
[08:20:25] <jargon> FunkyBob, there are multiple items caled “Most Recent” in my repo.
[08:21:31] <jargon> I had fogotten that I hadn’t updated the literal “Most Recent” section output html/styles.
[08:22:20] <FunkyBob> i don't understand where this is going
[08:23:55] <jargon> https://imgur.com/HN7a73C
[08:23:58] <jargon> See?
[08:24:10] <FunkyBob> nope
[08:24:19] <FunkyBob> your nav still looks messed up
[08:24:30] <FunkyBob> but maybe you want that now, and just haven't said
[08:25:00] <jargon> The nav looks ok, I just don’t want to continue doing it using tables.
[08:25:19] <jargon> There are two major interfaces, the navbar, and the section pane.
[08:25:33] <FunkyBob> well, I gave you a working solution for the nav section as a ul
[08:25:47] <jargon> Yes. I know.
[08:26:08] <jargon> I haven’t gotten your solution down pat.
[08:26:25] <FunkyBob> the styles were all at the top
[08:26:31] <FunkyBob> as always, if anything isn't clear... ask
[08:26:53] <jargon> Sorry, I don’t mean to frustrate you.
[08:28:01] <FunkyBob> here's a tip: communicate more...
[08:28:13] <FunkyBob> most of the time it feels like you think we can read your mind
[08:32:16] <jargon> I am not sure we are on the same page regarding my imgur links.
[08:32:34] <FunkyBob> i'm certain we're not
[08:32:59] <FunkyBob> that's why I've been asking you to clarify
[08:33:15] <jargon> Would you like me to make a documentary video?
[08:33:21] <FunkyBob> no
[08:33:24] <jargon> ;)
[08:33:25] <FunkyBob> just be specific about what you want
[08:34:04] <jargon> The page comes in two major components, the nav bar on the left, and the section pane on the right.
[08:34:15] <FunkyBob> ok
[08:34:20] <jargon> Each page is addressed by the project and section get handlers.
[08:34:28] <FunkyBob> I asked before if you wanted the "content" to wrap around the "nav"... you said yes
[08:34:33] <FunkyBob> now it sounds like your answer is no
[08:34:42] <jargon> I am not able to replicate that.
[08:34:54] <FunkyBob> I don't care what you've worked out how to do yet
[08:34:56] <jargon> I only want it to wrap on the main page.
[08:35:00] <FunkyBob> I'm asking what you WANT
[08:35:04] <FunkyBob> ok
[08:36:01] <jargon> I have no idea why I can’t replicate your JSFiddle demonstration.
[08:36:28] <jargon> But yes, that is what I am interested in.
[08:36:38] <FunkyBob> ok
[08:36:48] <FunkyBob> well, usual rules apply
