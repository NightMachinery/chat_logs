[03:03:40] <FromGitter> <practicalli-john> When in markdown mode I seem to have orgtbl-mode activated by default.  This results in the `TAB` formatting tables using org syntax rather than markdown syntax (header divider adds a `+` character rather than `|` for the header column separator) ‚èé I can use `SPC SPC orgtbl-mode` to switch off this mode each time I visit a markdown file (although that gets very tedious when I have projects with over 100

[21:34:45] <FromGitter> <franfram> Hello! I'm a data scientist working with R and Rstudio. I want to make the switch towards spacemacs ESS. What resources do you recomend I read?
[21:36:01] <FromGitter> <franfram> I already configured my spacemacs for data science, but I'm looking for a friendly article on how to use spacemacs for data science, since I'm a biologist by training and the docs for vim, emacs and spacemacs seem a little tricky

[21:52:48] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @franfram If you do not know vim keybindings yet, then I would suggest you start with the vimtutor...
[21:54:12] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> After that I think, the Spacemacs docs are generally quite useful. Quick start guide etc...
[21:55:21] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> If you really want to also enjoy using emacs, then I would suggest that you read some of https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/index.html
[21:56:16] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I have no idea about better documents
[21:56:55] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Additionally, you can frequently ask here, although I am not sure how many users do data science with R/ess here
[21:58:17] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Finally I am sure that there are guides about how to use ess with R, if you learned how to use Spacemacs, then you can use any guide (also guides for vanilla Emacs)
[21:58:51] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> You can anyway always switch to vanilla emacs keybindings by pressing C-z
[21:59:36] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Generally what you should know about major modes (I guess ESS provides one or two..), is that most of the major mode specifix commands can be found under `,`

[22:02:53] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> If there is no good guide yet, then if you take notes (which you can do immediately using org-mode), then you could be the one providing the first guide...
[22:59:32] <FromGitter> <franfram> Thank you Daniel
[23:00:34] <FromGitter> <franfram> Yeah, I still don't really get spacemacs, since it seems it uses both vim and emacs (i only know a little bit of vim atm). So do you recommend learning vim and emacs before diving into spacemacs?
[23:01:35] <FromGitter> <franfram> I mean, I know spacemacs is a mix between emacs and vim, what i meant is that I seem to be able to do something inside spacemacs in a vim way, an emacs way and a spacemacs way

[23:47:21] <Unicorn_Princess> how does spacemacs determine indentation mode? i don't recall changing it, and the way it works currently is that pressing tab indents by 2 space, /unless/ there's whitespace in the line above (other than end of line), in which case it indents up to the first whitespace character.. but in C++ mode it.. behaves totally bonkers. tab doesn't even work in insert mode :S
[23:51:05] <Unicorn_Princess> ah, just found https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+misc/dtrt-indent/README.html , i'll try and install that after dinner, maybe it'll solve my problems
[23:59:27] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I recommend, doing the vimtutor (i.e. learn some vim keybindings) and then read the introductions to Spacemacs... quick start guide and maybe part of the docs, and of course the docs for the ess layer
