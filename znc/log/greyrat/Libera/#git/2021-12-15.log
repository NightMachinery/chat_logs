[02:12:53] <imMute> Guest2525: assuming "working tree" == the index, no, it cannot.
[02:13:12] <ZacSharp> the working tree is the actual files in the file system
[02:13:13] <samgranieri> imMute no, I don't have a citation for that.
[02:13:14] <ZacSharp> so yes
[02:13:29] <imMute> samgranieri: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree uses worktree to mean the checkout, so it seems you are incorrect.
[02:14:39] <ZacSharp> I think it's more like the working directory is the same as for shells while the working tree is where git puts the files when checking them out
[02:14:40] <samgranieri> my undestanding is that your checkout, the worktree, is in a directory, which I think is your working directory
[02:15:15] <samgranieri> when you type pwd, it will print your working directory. ditto for cd, which will change your directory
[02:15:33] <imMute> samgranieri: yeah, "working directory" is also a *nix concept (typically most visible in shells)
[02:16:14] <furrymcgee> they are different in case of git --work-tree=..
[02:16:43] <ZacSharp> no, the working directory is still the same, git just adds working trees on top
[02:16:58] <samgranieri> I've been using git on macOS and linux since 2007. I stopped using windows professionally around 2007
[02:17:18] <ZacSharp> or does that option set the pwd even though it is called work-*tree*
[02:17:22] <imMute> furrymcgee: how is --work-tree related to -C ?
[02:18:03] <samgranieri> I'd have to read up more about git internals, as I think that's where this discussion is going
[02:18:28] <imMute> based on the manpage, -C seems to chdir() (set the working directory) before doing anything.

[02:24:28] <Guest2525> imMute: how if the working tree is only checked out files?
[02:24:55] <imMute> it's not *only* checked out files, it's just where checked out files go
[02:25:22] <ZacSharp> you should have cited the second sentence as well
[02:25:23] <ZacSharp> The working tree normally contains the contents of the HEAD commit’s tree, plus any local changes that you have made but not yet committed.
[02:25:34] <ZacSharp> untracked files are local changes
[02:25:38] <osse> not sure if git's own docs are consistent enough to worry about this :p
[02:25:58] <Guest2525> ZacSharp: untracked files are local changes?

[02:27:28] <ZacSharp> uh, I'm inconsistent at that as well
[02:27:33] <Guest2525> ZacSharp: I thought working directory was the root dir of the repo, and working tree was the tree of checked out files within the working directory. Like the working tree is a subset of the working directory but not vice versa.
[02:27:56] <ZacSharp> usually it's the other way round or they are the same
[02:27:58] <imMute> Guest2525: I'm going with osse and gonna say taht such a distinction doesn't matter and isn't consistent.
[02:28:18] <imMute> I've never heard "working directory" and "working tree" to mean different things.
[02:28:37] <Guest2525> imMute: there's a commit in git's repo that says they are
[02:28:49] <ZacSharp> I always associated them with the pwd and a git worktree

[02:30:38] <imMute> Guest2525: I don't know what to take from that other than maybe they're standardizing on "work tree" to avoid confusion with the *nix defintion of "[current] working directory"

[02:35:00] <imMute> the git -C description is basically the same as the semantics of chdir(), so I'm not surprised in the slightest
[02:35:28] <ZacSharp> also have a look at --git-dir
[02:36:02] <furrymcgee> it overlaps with --git-dir and --work-tree options
[02:36:07] <ZacSharp> they talk about the top level of the working tree there, which is where git expects the .git dir
[02:36:15] *** Joins: mikail (~mikail@2a02:c7f:bc1f:4a00:fc9:3da5:3e1e:8303)
[02:36:25] <imMute> --git-dir would be useful to have the .git directory outside the working tree
[02:36:48] <imMute> since git, by default, assumes it's at the root of the work tree.  or rather it searches upwards till it finds it and assumes *that* is the root of the work tree
[02:37:40] <ZacSharp> or it stops at the file system boundary if I forgot to cd into one of the worktrees
[02:38:19] <Guest2525> imMute: git-add manual says 'the "index" holds a snapshot of the content of the working tree". Doesn't that mean that the working tree cannot have untracked files since the index cannot?
[02:38:27] <ZacSharp> though I wonder where it would continue if I had enabled GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM
[02:39:02] <ZacSharp> Guest2525 maybe
[02:39:03] <imMute> Guest2525: no, because once you add an untracked file to the index (with git add) it's no longer untracked.
[02:39:25] <imMute> the work tree can obviously have untracked files otherwise "untracked files" has no meaning.
[02:40:34] <Guest2525> imMute: I thought only the working directory had untracked files, and not the working tree
[02:40:42] <imMute> Guest2525: those are the same thing.
[02:40:48] <imMute> working directory == work tree.
[02:40:58] <ZacSharp> no
[02:41:12] <imMute> well,  Git working directory == work tree.  "working directory" also has a meaning outside of git.

[02:41:21] <ZacSharp> working directory is where you access the repo from, usually the top level of the working tree
[02:41:34] <imMute> ZacSharp: citation needed.
[02:42:14] <ZacSharp> is this enought?
[02:42:15] <ZacSharp> The paths mentioned in the output, unlike many other Git commands, are made relative to the current directory if you are working in a subdirectory (this is on purpose, to help cutting and pasting). See the status.relativePaths config option below.
[02:42:21] <ZacSharp> it's from git status
[02:42:56] <imMute> they're relative to the *nix* working directory.   some people use "working directory" to mean the whole git work tree.  which is ambiguous, but that's language for ya.
[02:42:57] <osse> man gitglossary
[02:42:57] <gitinfo> the gitglossary manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/gitglossary.html

[06:47:55] <Jong> Hi. Should branch names use underscore or dash?
[06:48:31] <Jong> And, should branch names be present tense imperative statements like commits are?

[06:52:05] <nedbat> Jong: i don't think there's a strong convention for either.  branch names are usually really short, not full descriptions.

[14:58:21] <osse> oof, that shouldn't cripple the commit message at all
[14:58:46] <osse> maybe it's easier to let the cherry-pick go through, then do git checkout HEAD~ -- files && git commit --amend
[14:58:50] <osse> that should keep the author
[15:00:35] <graywolf> osse: commit --amend did not occur to me, that could work; I will give it a try (last bit to figure out is why -Xtheirs does not work with cherry pick)

They instead write paragraph by itself (https://github.com/openbsd/src/commit/993f8b84c9ce4be4421cebb4b89dce2fe71fa7b0). format-patch strips all the new lines and stuffs it into Subject: ; so the wrapped text is wrapped no longer after

[18:32:04] <SpeakerToMeat> jim, with what I have been doing to my repo and with my misshaps, I think I get a few things now....
[18:33:11] <nvmd> Why 'git difftool --tool=vimdiff <file>' appears to open 2 vim instances?
[18:34:05] <SpeakerToMeat> Like, it's not turtles all the way down, I'm still not sure if changed (or all files, or a "hard link of unchaged files") live on commits, rather than just a list of changes (I'm not sure because it seems so, but, the quickness and certainty with wich git -p produces a patch file for a commit that had a difficult merge with hand handled changes makes me wonder.
[18:34:19] <osse> nvmd: do you get a prompt saying "Viewing (1/2): 'foo.txt'" ?
[18:34:27] <nvmd> yes
[18:34:33] <SpeakerToMeat> jim, and I see, branches are basically a meta of commits, like a tag is, only persisten for commits when you're in a tag
[18:34:40] <osse> nvmd: and then 2/2 ?
[18:34:44] <SpeakerToMeat> s/a tag/a branch
[18:34:56] <nvmd> no, I'm diffing only 1 file
[18:35:00] <nvmd> so just 1/1

[18:59:49] *** Quits: SuperL4g (~akulbe@user/superlag) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[19:00:04] <imMute> maxzor_: there is no "out of tree kernel module dev repo".  all upstream kernel modules are developed alongside the rest of the kernel.
[19:00:10] <jast> maxzor_: does the dev repo have the same tree structure with all the other kernel stuff included?
[19:00:31] <jast> i.e. the full kernel source
[19:00:42] <maxzor_> I might not understand effectively
[19:00:52] <maxzor_> This is a mirror for the amdgpu kernel module : https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCK-Kernel-Driver
[19:01:20] <jast> yeah, that looks like a modified full kernel tree
[19:01:41] <jast> if you have a local clone of either of the repos, probably the easiest way is to add the other repo as a second remote and fetch it, then you can do 'git diff' and everything on both

[19:01:44] <gitinfo> the git-remote manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/git-remote.html
[19:01:48] <maxzor_> it is I believe a LTS 4.13 kernel, where AMD maintain their module
[19:02:31] <jast> however comparing between, say, something based on 4.13 and something based on the most recent version can be a little tricky, purely because of all the other changes between the two in the full tree
[19:03:14] <maxzor_> indeed^ Not sure about the wording, but I would be looking for a "one-way diff"; instead of a "two-way-diff".
[19:03:33] <nvmd> what's the difference between the 3 vimdiff's? A stackoverflow answer says it's related to the merge strategies. Is there a simpler way to put it?
[19:03:37] <maxzor_> That is, I'd like to see the commits in the third-party kernel tree that have not been upstreamed yet
[19:04:08] <osse> nvmd: the only difference is the configuration of the windows (what's shown and where)
[19:04:22] <osse> nvmd: I don't think there is any difference for difftool, only for mergetool
[19:04:25] <jast> it's irrelevant unless you use it as a mergetool or with a conflicted status, basically with a three-way merge it determines how many splits you see

[19:14:32] <osse> nvmd: the tip of each branch, the common ancestor, and the end result. that's four
[19:16:46] <jast> nvmd: you're getting confused because "merge" has two different meanings. one is merging branches (you're thinking of this), one is merging changes that happened independently on two lines of history, usually within a single file (that's what osse is talking about), and it usually happens as a result of merging one branch into another (two branches involved = two lines of history)
[19:17:19] <nvmd> I still can't see the difference.
[19:17:20] <jast> it also happend during some other operations, e.g. cherry-pick, revert and rebase
[19:17:33] <nvmd> to mee sounds like you're being redundant

[19:24:44] <jast> so let's say you have a single file in there, called main.c
[19:25:22] <jast> in B, you had a simple "hello world" in it. in D you translated it to Japanese, while in the meantime someone else translated it to French in C
[19:25:26] *** Joins: SuperLag (~akulbe@user/superlag)
[19:25:30] <jast> obviously, if you merge the two branches now, you'll have a conflict
[19:25:41] <jast> there are three versions of interest: the one from B, the one from C and the one from D
[19:25:48] <jast> that's why it's called a 3-way merge
[19:26:28] <jast> and in a view with 4 versions, the last file will be your target which you'll be editing and ultimately committing (probably)

[19:26:50] <nvmd> I'm with you so far
[19:29:13] <nvmd> and a 2 way merge? is it a merge that can be fast-forwarded?

[19:29:28] <nvmd> or am I approaching the terminology wrong?
[19:30:26] <jast> a 2-way merge doesn't quite exist, because if you only have changes on one side of a merge, you can just use the new version
[19:31:02] <jast> suppose D had touched an unrelated file, then we could *know* that C is the only commit that changed main.c and we could just use its version without having to do any merging of the file's contents from different versions

[19:39:59] <nvmd> my mental model of n-way merges was based on the idea of the idea that a 4-way merge was made up of the main branch + 3 other branches you're merging. It didn't account for a window which would be for what you'd compose and merge because my background is from using GUI tools that show only the conflicting changes on the 2 branches in a split view, so only 2 "windows", and you just click on which one
[19:40:01] <nvmd> you want to merge in, whether that's either or both or none.
[19:41:11] <imMute> sometimes the resolution is a 3rd piece of code that is a mix of the two sides.

[19:43:47] <nvmd> which seems like an overcomplication of the merge process altogether, and kind of makes me wonder whether people actually do this, which leads me bac to having doubts about whether I'm understading this whole thing correctly or not

[20:13:53] <osse> which should be harmless as SVG is basically text (I think?)
[20:13:58] <j416> you can use .git/info/attributes instead of a .gitattributes, if you want it to only affect your local repo
[20:14:25] <j416> iwp4u: well, this means git will modify your svg, maybe not what you wanted (?)
[20:14:51] <j416> svg is xml, but perhaps converting them to/from lf/crlf makes little sense
[20:15:59] <j416> although it _should_ be safe, since you'll get a crlf svg on checkout, but it'll keep it as lf in the repo.
[20:16:46] <j416> the only issue could be, I suppose, if your editor (inkscape?) has trouble with crlf svgs, or you somehow end up with mixed line ending types.
[20:17:49] <iwp4u> Okay. based on what y'all said, I think I'm okay then. I just wanted to make sure I didn't accidently change any git default settings and such. I just unstaged the svg because I don't want to add it and commit it.

[23:26:33] <SpeakerToMeat> do tags have any sort of sort/order to them?
[23:28:07] <imMute> SpeakerToMeat: no.  you could sort by creation date or name though, but there's no intrinsic order.
[23:28:28] <SpeakerToMeat> Oh but there IS a creation date
[23:28:38] <imMute> I think, lemme check.
[23:29:54] <imMute> it seems annotated tags have metadata on who made the tag and when, but non-annotated tags do not.
[23:30:52] <ikke> correct
[23:31:03] <ikke> lightweight tags are just refs, without metadata like branches
