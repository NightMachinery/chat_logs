[12:14:03] <Kiernian> I owned a house in a suburban neighborhood for 13 years and I got the cops called on *me* for walking around the block in my own neighborhood. Apparently smoking a meerschaum tobacco pipe after 10pm is sus.

[12:15:18] <Kiernian> Yeah. It is. Record was 11 stops in 40 minutes. Different cop car each time. That was one seriously funded and bored PD.

[12:16:21] <Kiernian> What can I say, I walk when I think and I do my best thinking when smoking. Had a sysadmin job for an MSP at one point where the smoking area got jokingly dubbed "conference room 0" because any difficult issues came up and every senior tech in the place was out there solving it and puffing away.

[20:10:37] <mistiry> many days my only meeting is the daily standup
[20:10:47] <PublicWifi> its nice to be "left alone" and just do your thing
[20:11:03] <mistiry> which lets me set up for my own benefit what my day will look like, inform the team and manager, hear what they are doing, and then we go work
[20:11:05] <DOMF> I think standup is good for remote teams as a daily check-in.
