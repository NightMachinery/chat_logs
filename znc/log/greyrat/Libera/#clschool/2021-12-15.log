[14:42:27] <bremner> it is? I found it mainly discouraging because the format used by SBCL (and CCL) is not listed explicitly, which I think means it is implementation dependent
[14:44:27] *** Joins: random-nick (~random-ni@87.116.167.143)
[14:47:15] <bremner> basically I have 3 partial paths, the third ending in a file name, and I want to join them up together in some fairly robust way. Currently I use pathname-directory to get lists of strings, but I don't know how portable it is to count on the return value being a list of the structure mentioned.
[15:08:52] <MetaYan> bremner: Sounds like two merge-pathnames could do the trick.
[15:11:25] <bremner> yeah, I guess I should try that again. I forget why I gave up. Maybe just fixated on the way I'm used to doing things.
[15:26:09] <bremner> oof: (merge-pathnames "third/base.type" (merge-pathnames (uiop:relativize-pathname-directory (uiop:ensure-directory-pathname "/subdir/path")) (uiop:ensure-directory-pathname "/root/path")))

[16:18:44] <MetaYan> bremner: If you can skip the initial / in subdir and ensure that you end directory strings with / , then it becomes simple: (merge-pathnames "third/base.type" (merge-pathnames "subdir/path/" "/root/path/"))
[16:20:45] <bremner> MetaYan: yes, but I can't assume things about the input because I'm writing a public API
[16:21:39] <bremner> I'm not super fond of the "missing trailing / changes the behaviour" thing either.
[16:28:13] <bremner> (I should have mentioned the public API part earlier, sorry for moving the goalposts)

[16:33:57] <MetaYan> bremner: When trying to ensure incoming paths (URIs mostly) follow a certain structure, I keep things as strings as long as I can and use the string-trim family of functions. But that's just my way of playing.
[17:23:55] <CodeBitCookie[m]> Hello Everyone!
[17:24:10] <CodeBitCookie[m]> Its been a while since I last came here.
[17:24:38] <CodeBitCookie[m]> Is there a shorter/better way to write this?: 
[17:25:26] <CodeBitCookie[m]> (reduce
[17:25:27] <CodeBitCookie[m]>     #'(lambda (x y)
[17:25:27] <CodeBitCookie[m]>         (and x y))
[17:25:27] <CodeBitCookie[m]>     '(nil t t t t) :initial-value t)
[17:25:38] <CodeBitCookie[m]> returns: => nil
[17:26:06] <CodeBitCookie[m]> whereas turning the `'(nil t t t t)` list into `(t t t t t) gives => t
[17:26:40] <CodeBitCookie[m]> The problem with `mapcar`ring or `apply`ing is that `and` is a macro 
[17:27:15] <etimmons> (every #'identity '(nil t t t t)) ?
[17:27:51] <CodeBitCookie[m]> Thank you, that did the trick!
[17:28:45] <etimmons> It also short circuits, so it returns nil after the first nil is found
[17:29:02] <etimmons> Which may or may not be what you want

[18:31:25] <rotateq> lazy evaluation, a surely powerful technique with much potential :)
[18:32:06] <rotateq> had to explain that recently in class when it came to discussing the difference between (&) and (&&) operators
[18:34:02] <rotateq> as it was about C# stuff ... brrrrr
[18:35:51] <pjb> How much time? Because in a lisp class, (macroexpand-1 '(and (a) (b))) #| --> (if (a) (and (b))) ; t |# is all there is to say to short-circuit operators.
[18:36:00] <CodeBitCookie[m]> Yeah, I totally agree with the obvious drawback of debug-ablity, although Lisp makes this much more seamless.
[18:36:09] <pjb> vs. say (macroexpand-1 '(logand (a) (b))) #| --> (logand (a) (b)) ; nil |# 
[18:36:26] <pjb> CodeBitCookie[m]: what drawback?
[18:36:51] <pjb> You can still step the high level operators. It's just a matter of choosing a good implementation with a good debugger ;-)
[18:36:57] <CodeBitCookie[m]> pjb: Lazy Evaluation makes it harder to debug some code.
[18:37:00] <pjb> Or to write your own.
[18:37:00] <pjb>  
[18:37:22] <pjb> Well, I answered to & vs && which is shortcircuiting operators, not lazy evaluation.
[18:38:53] <CodeBitCookie[m]> pjb: I forgot to make that a reply to rotateq 
[18:39:01] <CodeBitCookie[m]> * rotateq: Yeah, I
[18:39:27] <CodeBitCookie[m]> <rotateq> "lazy evaluation, a surely..." <- on this ^
[18:42:30] <rotateq> CodeBitCookie[m]: you don't have to reply to all :)
[18:42:54] <rotateq> pjb: yes okay, you're right
[18:43:42] <rotateq> but i tried them to explain why that can be useful and that it is really another programming paradigm, not even the teacher knew it ^^
[18:44:48] <rotateq> but i also didn't expect that
[18:48:40] <rotateq> or when making STRING= (as another simple example) on big strings, maybe first looking if the length is the same, then char by char until one CHAR= fails and then directly giving back NIL. or calculating hash sums of course ^^
[18:51:22] <pjb> You don't even need to compute the hash sum. But using some kind of random access may be useful, given that strings are not random.
[18:54:42] <rotateq> right, like with property testing by letting generate randomized tests :)
[18:55:08] <rotateq> in mathematics the probabilistic method by Paul Erdös is also very very powerful
[18:55:37] <bremner> not sure I see how they are related.
[18:56:19] <rotateq> bremner: ah you know the method? just related metaphorically for first
[18:56:59] <bremner> yes, I know the method reasonably well. It's a way of making counting arguments using the language of probability
[18:59:21] <rotateq> okay me not so well till now
[19:00:52] <pjb> rotateq: For example: https://termbin.com/snfnr
[19:02:51] <bremner> rotateq: in simple terms, it's a way of showing "mathematical objects" exist by showing they have non-zero probability 
[19:05:19] <rotateq> yes i know that, but not how to proof something new with it yet :)
[19:07:02] <bremner> ok, one never knows on the internet what people's background is
[19:18:21] <rotateq> right. I'm interested in mathematics :)
[19:18:55] <rotateq> but more the concrete and not too abstract stuff like in Knuth's "Concrete Mathematics"
