[08:47:50] <wez> eagles0513875: They can be as secure, more so or less than a VM or a bare metal machine, depends how you configure it :)
[08:48:07] <wez> like either any other means of running or deploying an ap

[09:03:12] <eagles0513875> mainly isolation from other containers etc

[09:56:13] <eagles0513875> where do i find the URI
[09:57:24] <eagles0513875> of my repo?

[17:07:20] <node1> When we 're building anything from Dockerfile, we are passing it to docker engine right?
[17:16:31] <hilltop> Really basic question here: when I run a Dockerfile inside a repo, with, say, a Python image, are the files from the repo inside the container automatically, or is it just the files from the image that I started with?

[17:28:02] <tabakhase> hilltop que?
[17:28:45] <hilltop> tabakhase I'm not sure what else I can say
[17:28:48] <tabakhase> docker "build" command has a arg for the "context" (often just ".") - this is what gets packed ans send to the daemon -- the actual build then can pick from this with ADD/COPY, and only that lands in the image
[17:29:11] <tabakhase> ((whats included in that first packing step can also be influenced with a ".dockerignore" file)
[17:29:37] <hilltop> ohhh - that is helpful, thank you! how does the VOLUME line in the dockerfile come into play?
[17:31:11] <tabakhase> in some sense "it does nothing" - just marks a path as "this will be a volume" - and docker run 2 weeks later will see this, and put a annon-volume in this place - so say dockr-compose may utomagically carry it over between generations
[17:31:43] <tabakhase> (but for anything you actually wanne keep you should always explicitly declare volumes anyhow)
[17:31:49] <hilltop> How would I access a volume at that point?
[17:37:01] <tabakhase> not sure if that answer is "you dont" or "i dont understand what you mean..." - maybe delve some more into what youre trying todo ;-)
[17:38:02] <hilltop> I guess I just don't understand waht a volume is, and why I would want to make one during the build

[17:44:01] <tabakhase> hilltop in some sense "you kinda dont" - its not required to have a VOLUME line before using anything as volume or bindmount - BUT, its nice little automagically-for-free-documentation on a image

[17:44:39] <tabakhase> and a annon volume docker automagically made on the "docker run" may one day save someones ass when forgetting to explicitly declare it ;-)
[17:44:58] <hilltop> lol excellent - thx for the help!
[17:47:51] <tabakhase> its a little similar storry with the EXPOSE instruction - its actual "use" is "docker run -P img" - what "publishes all exposed ports to random ports" (that then can be looked up with the `docker ports` command) - but like... noone does that --- and well, they also matter when "linking containers", but thats something noone should be doing these days anymore anyhow (use networks!) --- but 
[17:47:51] <tabakhase> still everyone puts em in there, cause no simpler way to note down what pot it is...
[17:48:05] <tabakhase> (this is obvs only a half-truth)
[17:49:00] <tabakhase> VOLUME may even be extra special as "how they act" changed between the older docker builder and that new "buildX" stuff as well... -.-

[20:24:47] <BtbN> What do you mean, login into a pid?
[20:25:41] <BtbN> jirido, if the image has no shell, editor, or anything, you can't really.
[20:25:52] <BtbN> can write a new Dockerfile that builds on top and adds stuff or something
[20:26:24] <node1> Like in step1 i have access to running container using docker exec -it .... && executed a script then logout from it. Again i want to login back into that environment where i have executed the script 
[20:27:06] <ikke> once you exit, the process stops
[20:27:06] <BtbN> If the container is still running, you can just exec again
[20:27:32] <node1> yes it's running
[20:28:01] <node1> but i want to login back into that pts/0 environment where i have run the django
[20:28:35] <node1> run the django or script*
[20:28:38] <BtbN> the specific shell you ran last time is gone the moment you exit it
[20:28:49] <BtbN> You'll get a fresh shell
