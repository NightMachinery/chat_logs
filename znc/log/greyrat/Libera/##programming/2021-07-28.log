[00:19:13] <mawk> yes Izem \int dx adds up all the dx

[00:20:03] <mawk> dx is always present in integrals pyzozord , I wouldn't call that differential calculus, it's just calculus

[00:20:07] <pyzozord> oh cool, today I learned something
[00:20:27] <mawk> if you see "dx" it's most likely inside an integral, and at the end of it
[00:20:30] <mawk> like \int stuff sutff dx
[00:20:46] <mawk> if you see dx outside an integral, it can mean several things
[00:20:59] <mawk> if you're in physics, it means an infinitesimal change in x, as they take some liberty with the notation
[00:21:32] <mawk> if you're in math, it can denote the coordinate function, dx(x, y) = x; dy(x, y) = y
[00:21:32] <Izem> great, that means I can just use Σ :P

[04:12:40] <mawk> equivalence between \int and Σ
[04:12:47] <mawk> with an example for \int x dx
[04:13:00] <mawk> dx is the width of a slice, we take it to be width 1/N
[04:13:12] <mawk> so dx equivalent to 1/N in the sum
[04:15:23] <Izem> thanks, I'm not as refreshed with limits so it does look funny seeing the limit of a sum
[04:15:26] <mawk> this is a left riemann sum, in many cases it's equal to the integral; but there are other ways to do it
[04:15:38] <mawk> well it's not really the limit of a sum Izem
[04:15:47] <mawk> since we give an exact expression to the sum before doing the limit
[04:15:53] <mawk> the sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + N
[04:15:58] <mawk> and that's exactly equal to N(N+1)2/
[04:16:01] <Izem> yeah
[04:16:02] <mawk> and that's exactly equal to N(N+1)/2      * sorry
[04:16:24] <mawk> and the limit to 1/N² N(N+1)/2 is easy, it's 1/2
[04:16:47] <mawk> but yeah you also have things such as limits of sums, called series
[04:16:56] <Izem> remind me how N gets removed in the 3rd step?
[04:17:14] <Izem> ah, that's what a series is
[04:17:17] <mawk> lim (1 + 1/N)/2 = 1/2 + lim (1/2N) ok?
[04:17:28] <mawk> and lim (1/2N) = 0
[04:17:37] <Izem> thank you :)
[04:17:53] <mawk> the limit when N -> +oo of 1/N is 0
[04:18:03] <mawk> and (usually) lim (A + B) = lim (A) + lim (B)
[04:18:15] <mawk> if both lim (A) and lim (B) exist
[04:18:49] <mawk> you can try the same for the integral of x²
[04:19:15] <Izem> intuitively this is something like a 1/ really large value will be close to 0?

[04:21:48] <mawk> for any distance small number ε, you can select a N_0 such that 1/N < ε whenever N > N_0

[04:26:14] <mawk> and in general \int_0^1 x^n dx = 1/(n+1)
[04:26:53] <mawk> you can prove it not so hard using this riemann sum thing
[04:27:26] <mawk> the crucial observation is that 1^n + 2^n + ... + N^n ~ N^(n+1)/(n+1)
[04:27:40] <mawk> ~ meaning a bit like O in computer science
[04:28:21] <mawk> it means when you use N^(n+1)/(n+1) in a limit expression you get the same result as if you had used the actual value of the sum
[04:28:23] <mawk> more or less
[04:28:45] <Izem> ok
[04:30:32] <mawk> you can see this crucial observation by doing the sum of k(k-1)...(k-n+1) from k = 0 to k = N, and that's exactly equal to (N+1)N(N-1)...(N-n+1) / (n+1)
[04:30:47] <mawk> and the last thing behaves like N^(n+1)/(n+1) when N is very large

[08:27:16] <Arahael> The problem is that it's not always a pretence, and there's usually other stuff going on. You just have to be very careful.
[08:27:18] <InPhase> Joanna: It's important to give people some benefit of the doubt.
[08:28:11] <Joanna> I try to do that but if it wrecks the channel that’s not a good thing.
[08:28:21] <InPhase> Joanna: The cost is much higher for abruptly rejecting someone in a vulnerable state asking for help and guidance.
[08:29:09] <Joanna> Yea it’s sad that trolls can make us become callous.
[08:29:30] <InPhase> Don't let them win that one.  :)
[08:29:33] <Arahael> Indeed.
[08:30:11] <Joanna> We once had a strange guy in another channel who had something that didn’t work in delphi and he kept demanding that we fix it for him and it got annoying and eventually he was banned.

[08:31:50] <Arahael> Joanna: As an op in your channel, you'll have to make those calls.  But do be careful to always be mindful of the human aspects of our situations.

[08:32:54] <Joanna> He came across and mentally impaired but it turned. Out he was some sort of YouTuber with poor social skills
[08:33:48] <Arahael> Right - there's usually something else going on.  But you do need to be careful.
[08:35:31] <Joanna> I usually talk to people for awhile before deciding that they are a troll but if they insult me or the channel I decide very quickly!

[08:43:29] <Arahael> Joanna: Lazarus has https://wiki.freepascal.org/LazLogger but in Delphi I was a big fan of using https://raize.com/codesite/
[08:43:51] <Arahael> Absolutely invaluable in investigating bugs from the field.

[08:45:35] <InPhase> Joanna: User reports of errors are typically grossly inadequate for the information you need to diagnose the problem.  It really helps narrow it down to save exactly the data you need, and then just request that file from a user reporting an error.
[08:46:13] <Joanna> I’m the only user of this at the moment
[08:46:13] <Arahael> My usual process in investigating a bug report for a customer: Ignore the bug report entirely, and just look straight at the logs. :(

[08:55:42] <Arahael> If the event "comes from" the dbgrid, yeah, I'd probably have done similar, make it the sender.

[10:34:03] <vdamewood> But seriously, 'Mo' and 'Mu' aren't distinct in Arabic. Either spelling is fine.
[10:36:09] <JanC> in Turkish it's written Mehmet or Mehmed even...

[10:38:07] <micrex22> vdamewood: technically translating any language with an alternative alphabet into Latin (in English) has five billion alternatives
[10:38:08] <JanC> so it's more like MHMD
[10:38:33] <micrex22> The Latin alphabet can't even represent all of English's sounds, let alone sounds from others :p
[10:38:56] <JanC> so local dialect differ in pronunciation
[10:38:59] <micrex22> So transliterative results are extremely mixed
[10:39:08] <Stryyker> This case english. Latin has letter letters.
[10:39:28] <Stryyker> And english has dropped a few letters over the years
[10:39:31] <micrex22> The Latin alphabet was never meant to support English

[12:07:29] <Decker> well roughly - mostly the array doesn't take on any character of the depended type so it's not really ...

[12:17:44] <alycidyne> d3x0r: well the bottom line is you can't really treat a nothing in the same way as a something, so do it right from the beginning

[12:19:39] <merijn> d3x0r: The realy thing about dependent types is things like: "vec :: Vector n Int" and having "size :: Vector (n :: Natural) a -> Natural" and then if you do "if size vec < 3 then foo else bar" that in the "foo" branch the type checker *knows* "n < 3" and in "bar" it knows "n >= 3"
[12:19:41] <smlck> the problem isn't with NULL itself, but forgetting or just not handling the case when something is NULL
[12:20:28] <merijn> So the main part of interest in dependent types is allowing *runtime* checks to add *compile time* information
[12:21:26] <Decker> hmm I don't see it adds compile information :) I mean you do the same thing in JS, since arrays have lengths intrinsically... (as do many languages after C)
[12:21:55] <Arahael> Decker: C also has lengths for the arrays.
[12:22:06] <Arahael> Decker: You just can't pass arrays.
[12:22:10] <Decker> Arahael only if they are in structs or limited to the scope

[12:23:23] <merijn> alycidyne: If you like obscure research projects, but don't wanna get too far away from C, you should have a look at SaC (Single Assignment C), which is pretty much all about not sucky arrays

[12:32:03] <Decker> alycidyne I know...
[12:32:42] <Decker> I'm not but my velocity isn't really 0.  If it was if I made myself 0.001m/s up I could just push off... there's something like a internal/virtual velocity already
[12:33:15] <Decker> (but that's not how it's viewed... so going back to 'converting pounds to Newtons...' which ends up as a force

[13:14:33] *** fuzzykef is now known as furrykef
[13:15:38] <Arahael> mrig: I think most of the time they just treat it as an additional core.
[13:16:11] <mrig> that a line of function calls could be grouped as being concurrent I suppose, and issued to be run together. Essentially that word order within some predefined unit is not important.
[13:16:31] <Arahael> mrig: And it's also up to the operating system how it's running on each core - by default usually they will have an affinity to the same core - the application may have to take explicit (platform-specific) steps to ensure they spread out.
[13:16:47] <GeDaMo> Most languages don't have that low-level a view of the processor
[13:17:00] <mrig> Right yes.

[15:01:13] <soulisson> I've a stupid question related to the definition of a function. A function is usually defined as a block of code that can be called, etc. But usually a function definition has the following format "header ({block}", I was wondering if the whole definition was considered to be the function or just the block part?
[15:02:55] <Decker> the whole definition; otherwise there's no calling signature to match
[15:02:59] <novns> soulisson, you cannot define a function without types of its arguments and yje return type
[15:03:04] <novns> *the
[15:03:06] <Decker> it's really mostly the header - that there's a block is a byproduct
[15:03:22] <Decker> sideeffect
[15:03:31] <novns> a block is the implementation, not definition
[15:03:33] <deniska> soulisson: languages typically have many different 'blocks' of code, only some of them are functions

[15:45:44] <pyzozord> Python is using a PEG https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Grammar/python.gram but they also have this ASDL thing which I don't know what it is https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Parser/Python.asdl
[15:46:10] <pyzozord> I'm not sure but it looks like python has it's own parser generator
[15:47:00] <bjs> pyzozord: the asdl is a 'fake' grammar to help generate Python AST, so if you change the underlying 'real' parser (e.g. from LL(1) to PEG) you don't end up having to change all the AST handling code

[15:52:07] <pyzozord> btw ok, I wasn't so clear what is the benefit of a stricter typing system like in typescript, it's pretty annoying and sometimes you have to fight it. But it does truly help with refactoring things, that is quite a big boon

[15:54:40] <pyzozord> oooh! sorry
[15:54:59] <merijn> tbh, that's the biggest hurdle I've encountered in explaining type system stuff to people. They ask for "small, simple examples where this helps", but the reality it mostly helps on "huge, sprawling examples that are hard to explain to beginners"

[15:57:30] <Guest78> Yeah, but I've been learning Elixir of late, and I never realised how much such languages actually suck when it comes times to debug issues, even minor ones, and the stack traces are pretty much useless
[15:57:36] <bjs> pyzozord: a rule in the PEG grammar looks something like `| 'if' a=pexpr ':' b=block  { _PyAST_If(_PyAST_Expr(a), _PyAST_Block(b) }`  the first part is the PEG grammar that matches the actual tokens in the file and the stuff in the {} is code the generated parser would generate, which for Python are constructors of the ASDL grammar

[15:59:18] <Guest78> Agreed... very convenient in modelling state as well
[15:59:21] <bjs> pyzozord: then Python's compiler (and all the other things like the `ast` library) use those ASDL-defined datatypes everywhere which the PEG grammar generated.

[19:07:59] <dracula> Izem: they're perfectly safe.
[19:08:11] <Izem> nice claim :P
[19:09:02] <dracula> Izem: you do know that Haskell itself compiles to machine code which is essentially typeless, right. typefulness is a part of the language semantics, not the architecture or transpiled language.
[19:09:50] *** gggpkm_ is now known as gggpkm
[19:09:56] <Izem> sure, but they preserve semantics along the way by transforming into smaller languages which are verfied
[19:10:46] <dracula> Izem: verified? do you think it's impossible to assure type safety if one compiles to JavaScript?
[19:11:34] <Izem> no, I just mentioned typescript
[19:12:36] <dracula> Izem: so what makes the others not safe?

[20:26:30] <entuland> I'm confused - it's already illegal to share copyrighted material like that, and it only takes one person with a legit access to that content to decrypt and convert it into a non-encrypted format somehow
[20:28:00] <GeDaMo> It's probably more about the companies making devices
[20:28:04] <deniska> entuland: The desired goal of DRM is to stop "first days" of piracy, when a game or a movie is expected to make the most buck

[20:35:20] <pyzozord> also outside of creating a pirate copy you need to share it for it be a problem for the companies. So from all the people who own the video capture card how many are incentivised to share the pirate copy and risk going to jail?

[21:25:25] <dan01> There an idea out there that Android is more "bloated" than iOS because of the native applications. iOS apps are compiled to run natively, while Android apps use Java, a VM and GC. But is that still true today? Since the replacement of Dalvik VM with Android Run-Time and AOT?

[23:29:03] <InPhase> pyzozord: I went with AMD this year for my laptop with 8 cores.
[23:29:25] <InPhase> pyzozord: The performance is superb.
[23:29:42] <pyzozord> I think my next device will be actually ARM or risc-v if that's possible
[23:30:31] <pyzozord> RISC-V is really something new. The open source cpu architecture is very interesting, and I think it will be empowering the users

[23:35:53] <jeaye> Linunx runs on the M1 as well.
[23:35:57] <deniska> pyzozord: M1 mac is actually not the worst ARM based platform as far as usefulness is considered.
[23:36:27] <deniska> It's a popular single target various OSes will eventually support
[23:36:44] <pyzozord> deniska: I've heard it's impressed many people. I myself never watch or learned anything about it out of principle of "being done with apple"
[23:37:12] <oldlaptop> pyzozord: The processor itself is easily the best, or one of the best, ARM processors on the market
[23:37:13] <deniska> the worst thing about M1 mac is that it's still a computer built by Apple, with famous Apple quality and Apple design choices :D
[23:37:54] <oldlaptop> Apparently it's possible to put your own operating system on the things, which seems surprising to me.
[23:38:43] <oldlaptop> (I had assumed they'd take the opportunity when switching Macs to ARM to require that all macOS programs come from their store too, but they haven't done that either -yet)
[23:38:45] <deniska> why would they lock it down? mac appstore isn't a big money maker

[23:40:47] <pyzozord> I'm sure there is a small counter-culture within Apple that agrees more with Steve Wozniak, even if he doesn't have to do anything with Apple anymore
[23:41:25] <oldlaptop> IBM had enough of a counter-culture back in the day that VM survived
[23:41:34] <InPhase> pyzozord: The people that agreed with Steve Wozniak probably use Linux.  :)
[23:41:39] <pyzozord> It's part of the identity of the company that the sleek marketing people are trying to sweep under the rug, but it's there and engineers know about it!
[23:41:54] <deniska> I think it's simpler than that, locking things down takes effort, and would annoy users who'd otherwise buy a macbook to run software not from store
[23:42:47] <pyzozord> InPhase: I wouldn't be surprised if they used linux in a vm on their mac machines when noone is looking :D
[23:43:05] <deniska> so they probably calculated that a small bit extra they'd make via mac appstore would be less than lost sales to people who'd run professional tools not from store

[23:43:29] <eyynet4> its kind of sad, didn't apple start out as an atari mod? now they lock down their hardware  with proprietary repair info and threaten lawsuits if you give out such info
[23:43:54] <InPhase> pyzozord: I think Linux has done such a good job of boosting its hardware support and aesthetics options that it has effectively eaten the portion of the engineering mindset market that Apple at one point had.
[23:45:19] <pyzozord> InPhase: I very much agree. I was trying linux as a desktop 10 years ago it was much poorer experience. It now looks good and does much better job. Also seems like the wifi drivers are not a problem anymore. I remember when it was common to not have wifi supported out of the box
[23:45:27] <deniska> with OS X they kinda tried to capture "unix, but with a desktop without sharp edges" group, but it's well served by desktop linux which if frankly quite good nowadays, by WSL in windows, and by SerenityOS
[23:45:38] <GeDaMo> eyynet4: Steve Wozniak deigned and built the Apple 1 and 2 himself along with writing the software for them

[23:46:38] <InPhase> pyzozord: One of the development challenges that the open source project in my libera affiliation is having, is that none of the developers have macs anymore.  It makes it challenging to keep supporting as a platform.

[23:48:48] <InPhase> deniska: Which is a guaranteed losing strategy.  Developers drive markets over the long term.

[23:49:52] <deniska> so, anyone put hackintosh on raspberry pi yet?
[23:50:32] <eyynet4> ah it had the same CPU, i must have misinterpretted the origins
[23:50:59] <pyzozord> as far as I understand it is technically possible to cross-compile on linux to make a mac/ios app

[23:52:58] <GeDaMo> «The original deadline was met after Wozniak worked at Atari four nights  straight, doing some additional designs while at his day job at  Hewlett-Packard. This equated to a bonus of $5,000, which Jobs kept  secret from Wozniak. Wozniak has stated he only received payment of  $350; he believed for years that Atari had promised $700 for a design using  fewer than 50 chips, and $1000 for fewer than 40, stating in 1984 that "we only got 700 bucks for it"»
