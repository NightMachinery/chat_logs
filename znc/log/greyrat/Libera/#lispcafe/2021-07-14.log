[17:11:02] <gilberth> Good morning #lispcafe!
[17:15:38] <treflip> hi gilberth ☺/
[17:15:50] <treflip> it's 15:43 in Russia, it's definitely not morning XD
[17:16:11] <shka> treflip: gilberth is a nocturnal creature
[17:16:30] <shka> he has different standard of "morning"
[17:19:36] <SAL9000> IRC timezone: it's morning when you join and night when you leave
[17:20:26] <shka> did i pasted link to those 3D printed void switches?
[17:20:53] <SAL9000> yes
[17:21:00] <shka> ok
[17:21:07] <shka> those are really interested
[17:21:13] <shka> *interesting
[17:22:12] <gilberth> shka: "creature"? Sure.
[17:23:04] <gilberth> TeX hasn't a manual, has it?
[17:23:11] <Gnuxie> creature is actually pretty nice inclusive language 
[17:24:04] <gilberth> Gnuxie: At least it was not "entity".
[17:25:57] <shka> glad that this term is accepted
[17:26:54] <gilberth> I like the "nocturnal" attribute.
[17:26:55] <treflip> Some modern "philosophers" say that people on the internet are ideas, not creatures
[17:27:36] <shka> oh, this is silly
[17:27:40] <Gnuxie> well, how is someone on the internet any different to a character in a book or a video game
[17:27:58] <gilberth> It interacts?
[17:28:30] <Gnuxie> i mean, this doesn't mean you can be mean to them obviously, unless you were mean in books and video games 
[17:29:08] <gilberth> But by that standard I could say, that every person in real life also is just an idea. How would I really know that other people are real, what ever that might be.
[17:29:14] <shka> i think that this goes way to deep into the simulacrum stuff for my likings
[17:29:25] <Gnuxie> you can't know who's really real, and it's kind of irrelevant whether they are 
[17:30:16] <gilberth> Sure. Thus why the line between "real" and the internet?
[17:30:56] <Gnuxie> well the line isn't real 
[17:31:07] <gilberth> I agree.
[17:31:49] <gilberth> It's only that a chat, say, has a lower bandwidth.
[17:33:23] <gilberth> But so has a phone call compared to meeting face to face. Nobody would say, that a person I have a conversation with on the phone, is just bits aka information aka an idea.
[17:34:30] <Gnuxie> well, if the person goes away forever are they still a person or are they an idea?
[17:35:49] <gilberth> A person I can't talk to anymore. Well, I could do so, but it won't answer.
[17:38:08] <gilberth> Curious question. Before waking up, I dreamt of my long dead father. He seemed pretty vivid.
[17:40:12] <gilberth> Anyhow, I would appreciate if TeX came with a manual. To really understand how TeX reads tokens and does macro expansion, I read both the TeXbook and the hard to read literal programming sources.
[17:41:37] <gilberth> I miss a grammar which says how builtin primitives like e.g. \hskip parse their arguments.
[17:42:16] <selwyn> i dreamt that my pc was on fire (but still working)
[17:42:47] <gilberth> selwyn: Heh, you shouldn't overclock too much.
[17:43:10] <selwyn> i tried to put it out for a while but then decided i would rather play games
[17:43:34] <gilberth> Was a flame thrower one of your weapons?
[17:43:56] <selwyn> i was probably playing fortnite, so no, not currently
[17:44:40] <selwyn> it used to have fire weapons

[19:04:03] <hayley> Can I use an atomic integer in OpenCL to allow other threads for some kernel to stop early? It'd be handy for the test on other threads to be fast, which is pretty easy in Lisp (you just CAS the place and every other thread sees it soon enough), but idk how similar GPUs are in that regard.
[19:05:04] <shka> i don't know if sharing data across multiple thread would influence opencl execution strategy
[19:05:12] <shka> i would say it should
[19:07:05] <hayley> I think that much is specified. But AIUI I really am supposed to use explicit atomic_store and atomic_load, and to use relaxed consistency because I have nothing to synchronise.
[19:07:37] <hayley> If that is still too slow, I guess I can move it out of a work loop so that we only check every so often.
