[02:41:59] <waleee> oops, (style ...) used spinneret not cl-css
[02:47:30] <waleee> ... redacting that. cl-css it it, but you need to change it to something like https://github.com/ericdrgn/drgn.nyxt/blob/main/themes/drgn-dark.lisp#L105

[17:57:07] <waleee> xaltsc: did you make any progress with your css issue?
[17:58:21] <xaltsc> waleee: I solved it by setting ids/classes to concerned html boxes, but as you said in the issue, the problem lies with spinneret, I likely won't be able to solve it myself.
[18:02:56] <waleee> I'm not sure spinneret will solve it by adding arbitrary css strings, it seems a bit out of it's intended scope. Also the cl-css option exist
[18:08:19] <xaltsc> waleee: Yeah, I use cl-css in my real config, but it compiles to a css string. I think the dev have to allow not escaping characters when the style slots is written into the buffer.
[18:11:34] <xaltsc> In case anyone is interested, here's my progress on making nyxt look more like vim (with lightline) and less like (ewwww) emacs https://img.tedomum.net/data/2021-10-25-163605_1919x57_scrot-0d425b.png https://img.tedomum.net/data/2021-10-25-163556_1919x61_scrot-f96e55.png https://paste.sr.ht/~xaltsc/62fc1e836207ce2373ede8af766eb3865fc01a86
[18:13:31] <waleee> Nice styling, but that was some fighting words :P
[18:13:59] <waleee> are you using vim with slimv/vlime?
[18:16:36] <xaltsc> waleee: I guess so, I can't manage to move the ~/.slime folder in some more XDG-compliant place. I haven't touched my Lisp config in ages.

[22:15:09] <jmercouris> Sugar comes from sugar cane
[22:15:14] <jmercouris> Sugar cane is a fruit
[22:15:18] <jmercouris> Ergo macaroons are a fruit

[22:18:30] <jmercouris> Surely they have some strawberry in them
[22:18:46] <jmercouris> I’m certain there is a fruit component somewhere
[22:19:47] <jmercouris> And damn, sugarcane is not a fruit :-(
[22:19:52] <jmercouris> That is most unfortunate
