[00:00:23] <jacob_theknight[>  * Hello, sorry to bother everyone, but I found a post with a near identical issue that I was having- https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/discuss-gnuradio/2018-04/msg00252.html. I assume from the lack of a response that it worked for the person who asked the question (and hopefully me). However, I'm not sure what exactly to change in the CMAKEs since I can't even find "RUNTIME" in the default cmake produced by gr_modtool
[00:01:17] <DerekKozel[m]> Hmm
[00:03:58] <DerekKozel[m]> I can't quickly find an obvious example of doing what Michael suggests there
[00:04:40] <DerekKozel[m]> You did build GNU Radio from source, can you confirm that gr-fft is enabled?
[00:05:06] *** Quits: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[00:05:21] <DerekKozel[m]> gnuradio-config-info is the command
[00:05:22] <jacob_theknight[> Sorry if this is a dumb question- but what do you mean by confirm if gr-fft is enabled? 
[00:05:43] <DerekKozel[m]> Maaybe --all or --help and find something that says show enabled components
[00:05:48] <jacob_theknight[> Maybe this is the answer, but I tried using the planner function inside the fft class and calling it's constructor doesnt seem to cause issues
[00:06:11] <DerekKozel[m]> I'm not on a system at the moment and not all the commands are at my fingers
[00:06:27] <DerekKozel[m]> You're building an out of tree module using gr_modtool as the basis?
[00:06:30] <jacob_theknight[> ah, it was --enabled-components
[00:06:36] <jacob_theknight[> yessir
[00:06:47] <DerekKozel[m]> Cool, just staying on the same page :)
[00:06:50] <jacob_theknight[> It seems gr-fft is there
[00:07:34] <DerekKozel[m]> ok, so, you've got an install, it has gr-fft, and you have an OOT that builds (against this install of gr?) but cannot include <gnuradio/fft/fft.h>
[00:09:17] *** Joins: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter)
[00:09:57] <DerekKozel[m]> And also, you have a specific reason to use GR 3.8? That's fine, just some nice improvements have happened in newer versions including giving CMake a good tidy
[00:09:58] <jacob_theknight[> I think the include works fine- and it even builds everything correctly when doing cmake [cmake options here] && make install
[00:10:56] <jacob_theknight[> also, when I try to create the pointer to the fft class, it works. However, when I include trying to instantiate the fft_complex(1024) function, it seems to cause issues at runtime (still builds and installs though)
[00:11:47] <jacob_theknight[> I was just using 3.8 since I was under the impression that it was currently more stable 
[00:12:01] <jacob_theknight[> but I guess I'd still prefer if the final solution could be in 3.8
[00:12:13] <DerekKozel[m]> 3.10.1.1 Is the most recent stable release
[00:12:45] <DerekKozel[m]> 3.9 is very stable at this point, and API forward compatible to 3.10 (99%)

[00:14:33] <DerekKozel[m]> Sounds like there's a linking issue. I'm not very active on 3.8 any more so been a while since I've done much with it's CMake. Most of the time I'm updating an OOT from 3.8 to a newer release
[00:16:02] <jacob_theknight[> Hmm, okay- I'll try that and let you know if it works. If it doesn't, i'll try to spend some more time digging through the cmake
[00:16:17] <jacob_theknight[> thank you for the help!
[00:17:30] <DerekKozel[m]> Sure thing. You're in the right place. You could try in #development:gnuradio.org as well, though that's more about work on GNU Radio itself, but there are some CMake gurus in there
[00:18:07] <LordKalma> good cmake is very very very very rare
[00:18:24] <DerekKozel[m]> Yep! Don't look at mine
[00:18:24] <LordKalma> but from what I skimmed trough grc codebase from a link earlier, it's actually quite decent
[00:18:52] <DerekKozel[m]> There were some really good contributions made ~3.9 and then again for OOTs in 3.10
[00:18:57] <LordKalma> DerekKozel[m], I usually say cmake actually costs 30€
[00:19:07] <LordKalma> aka the price of Professional CMake by Craig Scott
[00:19:59] <LordKalma> worth a reading
[00:20:10] <LordKalma> also, #cmake on the cpplang slack is a nice forum to be on :)

[11:38:25] <clever> patchvonbraun[m]: would popping a BNC T junction and a 75ohm terminator help by almost entirely negating the likely mohm impedance of the scope?
[11:39:58] <clever> i guess the main question (which you already answered), is if its based on total area under the waveform (integrator) or if P-P is enough
[11:41:09] <tnt> pretty sure you need RMS value.
[11:41:21] <tnt> P-P would only work if you have a pure-sine.
[11:42:02] <clever> tnt: for more details, i have an rf modulator box, that turns composite into channel 3/4, and i wanted to see how much rf power its putting out, because the signal is crap at the end of a longer cable
[11:42:56] <LordKalma> U.FL is an evil connector
[11:43:00] <LordKalma> and should be sent to hell
[11:44:07] <LordKalma> clever, the right procedure for that, if your scope doesn't have 50ohm internal termination is to use a dummy load with sampling points
[11:44:09] <tnt> clever: I'm guessing you can just ignore the modulation and assume it's still a pure sinewave.
[11:44:47] <LordKalma> and then P=V^2/R 
[11:44:49] <clever> tnt: yeah, i can also control the composite input, and generate a perfectly still frame, so there is no chance of the total luma value changing things
[11:45:52] <LordKalma> non-RF scopes usually only have high-Z unfortunately
[11:45:52] <clever> LordKalma: checking closer, yeah, the scope is labeled as 1meg-ohm, and has no switch, its an ancient tektronix 2232
[11:47:10] <clever> https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTLhnWNqHmBH6U4rTAeuKOTVbEPJYZ2bNLCUQ&usqp=CAU
[11:47:46] <clever> LordKalma: could i just slap a 75ohm terminator onto a T junction like this, and then the 1meg scope basically doesnt count, and its measuring right by the termination, so very little reflections
[11:48:09] <LordKalma> that should allow for a rough measurement, sure
[11:48:39] <clever> i'll have to dig out that box of bnc adapters then
[11:50:34] <LordKalma> honestly, we use 50ohm scopes at work for this reason, and I'm always surprised nobody has burnt one so far
[11:51:28] <LordKalma> what did I just do? ffs
[11:51:41] <clever> my scope had a cheater plug on its cord, for rather scary reasons....
[11:51:46] <Swift110-mobile> Sup folks
[11:51:54] <clever> the probe gnd, was being connected to non-grounded reference points
[11:52:12] <clever> and making the scope float at high voltages, allowed probing without blowing a fuse
[11:52:44] <LordKalma> there are some damaged scopes/analysers around but it's mostly because people applied DC voltages to them
[11:52:49] <LordKalma> RF-SAs especially hate DC
[11:52:59] <clever> oh, my scope has been thru far worse, lol
[11:53:16] <clever> the calibration guy knocked an rf gasket loose when cleaning the cal-void sticker gunk
[11:53:20] <LordKalma> high-Z scopes don't give a shit 
[11:53:29] <clever> it was randomly shorting something out, and causing the crt to go blank.....
[11:54:29] <LordKalma> at work we have these
[11:54:29] <LordKalma> https://i.imgur.com/5mImsdF.jpg
[11:54:50] <LordKalma> 4 scopes wired together, 70GHz :D
[11:54:54] <clever> nice
[11:55:02] <clever> mine is only rated for 100mhz
[11:55:08] <LordKalma> there's a group that does need to do those crazy 4-channel 50GHz measurements
[11:55:13] <clever> but ive somehow measured a 125mhz signal, and no it wasnt aliasing
[11:55:26] <LordKalma> it doesn't alias because it's analogue :p 
[11:55:45] <LordKalma> we have a circuit breaker just for those 4 scopes... at 1300W each, ya know...
[11:55:46] <clever> i have analog modes on mine, but that also has lower brightness
[11:55:49] <LordKalma> thank god for aircon
[11:55:51] <clever> because it only scans when it triggers

[11:57:19] <clever> https://imgur.com/a/XEj50WW an example of measuring 125mhz and 80mhz on mine, but given the 100mhz rating, i dont know if i should blame the scope or the signal source, for the loss of P-P
[11:58:06] <LordKalma> it should have some filters and everything above 100MHz will be increasingly attenuated 
[11:58:35] <LordKalma> and mind you, any kind of digital device doesn't work right next to the nyquist limit, that would be suicide
[11:58:42] <clever> but the signal source is also only officially rated for 75mhz
[11:58:49] <clever> but has no filters, its just raw gpio
[11:59:07] <LordKalma> for example, those 70GHz scopes sample at 200GS/s
[11:59:12] <clever> the scope is also using repetitive store, to cheat nyquist
[11:59:40] <LordKalma> our 45GHz arbitrary wave generator samples at 120MS/s 
[11:59:44] <LordKalma> there's always some leeway 
[11:59:47] <clever> it records a string of samples, then a second string, with a slight offset from the trigger point, and interleaves ~10 of those sample sets
[12:00:00] <clever> so if the signal is repeating, you can fake a higher sample rate
[12:00:08] *** Quits: Rayston1 (~Rayston3@98.186.216.102) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[12:00:13] <LordKalma> yes, we have interpolating scopes as well
[12:00:44] <clever> and that also makes it fuzzy, is 100mhz the rating for non-repetitive mode? just the rating for the analog frontend?
[12:01:33] <LordKalma> 100MHz probably means "we designed the analogue filters for this rating, and the digital bits assuming that + some leeway, go over at own risk"
[12:01:43] <LordKalma> again, nothing has a hard break on its rated limits
[12:01:56] <clever> in repetitive mode, if i can clearly see a 125mhz signal (although, i think it was just 2 samples per cycle), that would maybe make the virtual sample rate 250mhz?
[12:02:16] <LordKalma> also, fun fact, for example our 120MS/s AWG actually uses 4 interpolating DACs @ 30GHz
[12:02:39] <clever> yeah, ive heard of similar happening with 4 channel scopes
[12:02:47] <LordKalma> you can even see peaks at 30GHz intervals with a good enough scope 
[12:02:51] <clever> if you only use the right combination of 2 channels, you get double the sample rate
[12:03:00] <clever> but if you use the wrong 2 channels, you get halved
[12:03:04] <LordKalma> uyes, those scopes in the picture are like that exactly
[12:03:10] <clever> because its stealing a DAC from one channel over
[12:03:32] <clever> and just throwing a 180 degree phase offset on the sampling clock
[12:03:33] <LordKalma> you can use the ATI channel @ 200GS/s, or two normal channels at 100GS/s
[12:05:05] <clever> oh right, i dont think my scope even has 2 dac's
[12:05:12] *** Joins: goldrak (~goldrak@bl16-27-108.dsl.telepac.pt)
[12:05:18] <LordKalma> that's why they are using 4 of them for 4 channels worth of 200GS/s
[12:05:22] <clever> i have to choose between add/alt/chop modes
[12:05:48] <clever> i'm not sure what chop does, but alt i believe will just alternate sampling each input
[12:06:17] <clever> add is pretty obvious though

[17:38:27] <ron[m]12> > Did you try running it in GRC?
[17:38:27] <ron[m]12> Yes. It works on GRC 
[17:38:55] <ron[m]12> Python path is set up 
[17:42:08] <ron[m]12> Everything works in flow chart. When I export it and run .python file it gives me errors. Is it suppose to generate other files 🤔 
[17:46:01] <muaddib[m]> No, GRC just generates a python script. Sounds like it’s your IDE. I use pycharm and I had to tell it explicitly to use the existing python install, otherwise it would make a virtual environment that didn’t include GNURadio.
[17:47:18] <ron[m]12> Yeah you're right. I am using venv
[17:48:17] <muaddib[m]> Yea, your venv probly doesn’t have gnuradio
[17:48:51] <ron[m]12> Is it pipenv, poetry or conda?
[17:49:31] <ron[m]12> I cant remember which one I used unfortunately. Let me check 
[17:49:55] <muaddib[m]> It depends on which installation method you used
[17:49:57] <ron[m]12> * I cant remember where I installed it unfortunately. Let me check 
[17:51:40] <muaddib[m]> If you open a new terminal, not in your IDE and run:
[17:51:40] <muaddib[m]> Python3 your_Flowgraph.py
[17:51:40] <muaddib[m]> Does that work?
[17:52:20] <muaddib[m]> Or if you just open a new python interpreter shell
[17:52:20] <muaddib[m]> Can you do 
[17:52:20] <muaddib[m]> import gnuradio?
[17:52:46] <ron[m]12> > <@muaddib:gnuradio.org> If you open a new terminal, not in your IDE and run:

[17:52:46] <ron[m]12> Yes.
[17:54:39] <muaddib[m]> OK, it’s just your IDE then. Do you need to set it to use your system’s installation of python and the packages
[17:54:47] <muaddib[m]> s/Do//
[17:56:42] <muaddib[m]> gnuradio is usually in /usr/local
[17:56:58] <muaddib[m]> But it depends on how you installed it
[17:58:48] <ron[m]12> Mine is under usr/share
[18:01:37] <muaddib[m]> How did you install gnuradio? 
[18:01:38] <muaddib[m]> It would’ve been either through APT or source most likely
[18:02:46] <ron[m]12> APT
[18:03:41] <BarryDuggan[m]> doesn't apt install in /usr ?
[18:03:42] <muaddib[m]> So it’s probably in /usr/lib/python3

[18:06:02] <muaddib[m]> ron: there are some parts of gnu radio in /usr/share most likely the examples. But you need to square up your problem here. 
[18:06:02] <muaddib[m]> It sounds like your IDE is not configured to look at your systems python packages.
[18:06:03] <muaddib[m]> That should just be a matter of setting your IDE to use your systems installation rather than a virtual environment
