[00:54:34] <mawk> yes GeDaMo but not exactly

[00:54:58] <mawk> i.e. if we could prolongate the frustum to recreate the pyramid
[00:55:06] <mawk> but in this case, it can be any two rectangles in any proportion

[00:58:59] <mawk> yes that's what I could do GeDaMo but I wanted to relate the upper plane of the new partially filled shape to the actual upper plane of the totally filled shape
[00:59:17] <mawk> because now there is a linear relationship between the width of the upper partially filled plane, and the partially filled height
[00:59:35] <mawk> the width goes from w_A to w_B when the plane moves up
[00:59:43] <mawk> which makes it infinitely easier to invert the formula later on
[00:59:49] <mawk> but maybe I'm missing something
[01:00:28] <mawk> the width of the partially-filled shape is w_A + h_p/h (w_B - w_A), it's a simple "linear" relationship
[01:01:14] <mawk> if I don't use this relationship then I have two more variables I would need to simultaneously solve for: the width and depth of the partially filled upper plane, in addition to solving for the height of the partially filled upper plane; which would be pretty much impossible

[01:20:24] <Izem> memcpy is for contingous elements like an array

[01:25:10] <mawk> you need to copy each element

[01:25:20] <mawk> it takes O(1) to access, but not O(1) to copy
[01:25:22] <flaknet99> if going to the wikipedia definition, they claim a process is "depending on the operating system"
[01:25:30] <Izem> std::vec is implemented with arrays iirc

[01:25:49] <Izem> how does memcpy work here?

[01:25:53] <Izem> I don't know

[01:26:21] <Izem> ok
[01:26:27] <mawk> actually it probably uses architecture-dependant instructions that do it faster, like movs, but it's the same thing in the end
[01:26:29] <mawk> it copies every byte
[01:26:38] <mawk> dan01: to access yes, not to copy
[01:26:40] <Izem> that's not O(1) then
[01:26:44] <mawk> yeah
[01:27:04] <Izem> that's O(block size)
[01:27:15] <dan01> I still don't get it, if it's a contiguous array of elements
[01:27:19] <mawk> yeah which is the same as O(n) Izem

[06:35:53] <droid3> The issue becomes when the variables get to be huge amounts then reducing can be an issue but most problems i have encounter only use a few dozen variables.
[06:36:32] <droid3> So i am kind of curious to know in practice when we start using to many variables to make boole algebra impractical to reduce to zero or convert into a boole polynomial????
[06:37:31] <droid3> At any extent many people that are taught circuits/digital logic get confused with boolean algebra vs boole algebra.

[06:39:03] <droid3> Which is very powerful tool. In solving most set theory , logic or circuit/digital logic design simplification problems.

[06:45:35] <droid3> Its very subtle of a difference but when going back and looking closer its really a significant difference. One is inclusive or based (boolean algebra) the other is exclusive or based (boole algebra) 
[06:46:23] <droid3> The conversion between then is pretty straight forward and even more straight forward for circuit/digital logic design researchers.
[06:47:52] <droid3> We use boolean algebra "first" describe set theory logic , or circuit /digital logic but then to really work systematically we convert everything into boole algebra arithmetic.

[06:55:08] <droid3> I just dont see many examples that make this problem difficult even though it is NP complete most of the practical problems i ever want to solve is definitely in the realm of just having the computer simplify boole algebra.

[06:57:00] <droid3> I mean when do we get to the level of need to many variables in the equivalent boole algebra to simplify in a reasonable amount of time.

[06:57:33] <droid3> Because even though this problem is NP complete most of the time its pretty quick in most practical cases.

[11:38:50] <beaky> alan perlis sure has alot of quotes
[11:39:07] <akronymus> He is one of the big names in compsci IMO.
[11:39:07] <pyzozord> I was just thinking that 10x10 is better because of mental chunking
[11:39:16] <pyzozord> easier to keep 10x10 in head than 1x100
[11:39:19] <akronymus> Altough, not that well known.
[11:40:23] <pyzozord> but it probably depends on the context, if you don't need ot keep it all in head than 1x100 might be better because you keep only 1 data structure in mind instead of 10, and you never keep the functions in your head, you always look them up
[11:40:31] <pyzozord> shrugs

[11:41:39] <akronymus> Data structures as in collections, for the most part.
[11:42:00] <pyzozord> i don't know, for example dijkstra is a much more complex algorithm than the data structure it operates on
[11:42:26] <akronymus> Doesn't dijkstra operate on a directed graph?
[11:42:33] <pyzozord> yeah
[11:42:36] <akronymus> + weights
[11:43:00] <akronymus> But how do you implement such a graph?
[11:43:15] <akronymus> Also: a directed graph has many other uses as well.
[11:43:21] <pyzozord> graphs as data structures are pretty simple
[11:43:31] <pyzozord> conceptually
[11:43:38] <akronymus> Yeah, with mutability they are easy to construct.
[11:43:48] <pyzozord> actually generally data structures at least the fundamental ones seem to be much less complex than the algorithms that operate on them
[11:44:06] <akronymus> Without it... you have to sort them first in order of dependencies then you can start constructing it.
[11:44:15] <akronymus> Indeed.
[11:44:31] <akronymus> Less complex usually means better IMO for data structures.
[11:45:25] <pyzozord> i guess so, keeping complexity in the algorithm at least keeps it compartmentalized
[11:45:53] <pyzozord> if you keep the complexity in the data structure, you impact every single algorithm that works on this data structure
[11:46:10] <akronymus> And if you input a collection and get a collection out then you can use the same functions on the before and after.
[11:47:01] <akronymus> I have seen too many cases, where a perfectly fine list or array got converted into some object + child objects that were hell to use.
[11:47:21] <akronymus> Because "it needed some enhanced functionality"
[11:48:34] <akronymus> http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html oh finally found the actual list
[11:48:45] <akronymus> So much "self evident" stuff in there.

[11:49:06] <beaky> yes what if we applied more formal methods in data structure design like refinement types https://alloytools.org/about.html

[13:39:04] <mrig> getting stuck on any 'one way' is fatal.
[13:39:26] <dTal> You can't cleanly silo the different "branches" of math because they overlap too darn much
[13:39:37] <akronymus> That too.
[13:39:38] <piou> I wouldn't say that programming in general is math. Math is a language used to describe relations between things and their properties, so you can apply math to anything. But just because you can describe making mashed potatoes using math doesn't make mashed potatoes mathematical per say. Math can be useful to some aspects of programming, and much of programming benefits from a symbolic
[13:39:41] <mrig> But that is the beauty in my opinion.
[13:39:44] <piou> perspective, but is programming math in and of itself? I think it's its own thing that just lends itself well to mathematical description.
[13:39:49] <akronymus> But I personally believe math != math in all cases.

[13:47:26] <mrig> To my mind boolean logic is not at that base of everything, as such to expect proof of everything is to hold onto a incoherent axiom.
[13:47:41] <piou> dTal: when saying "Let A be a point" we are absolutely in the realm of performative language.

[13:51:16] <dTal> If we meet aliens, they will not have the same mathematical language. But I suspect they'll have the same proofs.
[13:51:50] <piou> dTal: mapping a real world problem to the "world" of words or to the world of ethereal mathematics isn't that different either
[13:51:53] <mrig> dTal: how might 'facts' relate to probability? Seems to me that there is an inherent and unavoidable connection.
[13:52:06] <mrig> inescapable even.

[13:54:50] <piou> Consider randomness. Does randomness exist? Is our universe predictable? Is there a god moving things at will? We don't know what the reality is, what we know is that there is a mathematical model (randomness) that happens to properly describe what we experience, but it doesn't require any link to reality or to an alternate universe. It's its own thing.

[15:00:00] <pyzozord> how do you people just know everything
[15:00:04] <bjs> Haskell looks similar to ML but has quite a different execution model and a lot of extra features (e.g. typeclasses) that make it very different

[15:00:37] <GeDaMo> pyzozord: reading! :P
[15:00:43] <akronymus> There are a few basic groups of languages I'd say most other programming languages descended from: standard ML, C (or rather algol), lisp and sql
[15:00:49] <akronymus> For the common ones.
[15:01:05] <arahael> I'd probably put Haskell into a category of it's own.
[15:01:20] <pyzozord> I can't... It's too much. I already spend pretty much all time learning
[15:01:21] <akronymus> Haskell seems quite close in syntax to ml.
[15:01:28] <pyzozord> (or playing games)
[15:01:28] <bjs> I'd not,  it's a clear descendent of ML from a lot of the same people
[15:01:36] <akronymus> But it has so many more features that it evolved quite a bit further

[16:50:14] <mawk> it's exactly the code I've showed then
[16:50:29] <mawk> all pairs are different because you always have i < j

[16:51:41] <mawk> pyzozord: having a repetition can mean two things: you have a pair (a[i], a[i]), or you have somewhere two pairs (a[i], a[j]) and (a[j], a[i]) with i != j

[17:03:05] <user51> write programs instead
[17:03:27] <PlanckWalk> And yes, the x^y function is discontinuous at (0,0)
[17:03:39] <Rounin> akronymus: Maths must be made to use parentheses everywhere or Polish notation
[17:03:49] <user51> if someone says that you need the math to program, ask them what comes before the math
[17:03:57] <PlanckWalk> (So you shouldn't expect any particular limit to be equal to the function there)
[17:04:00] <user51> they will segfault
[17:04:08] <mawk> PlanckWalk the limit is 1
[17:04:16] <akronymus> Rounin polish is prefix, right?
[17:04:17] <mawk> it's x^x, not x^y; it converges to a limit in this case
[17:04:18] <Rounin> * / 2 2 + 1 1 There I fixed it
[17:04:23] <Rounin> akronymus: Yeah
[17:04:34] <mawk> x^x is exp(x·ln(x)), and x·ln(x) → 0 when x → 0, so the whole thing converges to e^0 = 1

[19:54:14] <bjs> pyzozord: okay so 12,2.  12 is 2*2*3 and 2 is well 2.  So the factors are (12, {2,3}) and (2, {2}).  Divide both by the common factors (2) leaving us with (2*3, 1).
[19:54:18] <mrig> if there are many maths, would it not also stand to reason that there be many different types of mathematicians?
[19:55:45] <bjs> pyzozord: the issue with dividing both is that you're still left with that 2, that's why you need this % stuff. What you really want to do is get rid of that 2... because... it's common to b
[19:55:48] <bjs> without getting rid of the 3
[19:56:15] <piou> In english, when you say "physics" do you understand that as a plural meaning "many physical fields"?
[19:56:24] <pyzozord> bjs: yep, that's what I have in my output: match { a: 12, b: 2, g: 1, a2: 6, b2: 1 }
[19:57:01] <bjs> pyzozord: do you understand my point about 2 being common?
[19:57:09] <Matt|home> no. in general piou "physics" in the united states refers generally to high school or college physics, mainly dealing with kinetic motion, occasionally gravity etc. but not more complex fields like nuclear physics. we usually specify the type of physics you're discussing
[19:57:22] <Matt|home> like geology - you'd specify volcanology or micropaleontology

[19:58:10] <pyzozord> bjs: I guess I don't. 2 is the gcd in this case
[19:58:17] <piou> Thing is, in French we say "la physique", "la science" and "les mathématiques" so physics is singular, science is singular,  but mathematics are a special case where they're plural
[19:58:23] <Matt|home> i'd argue the average layperson wouldn't understand the distinction. we are pretty effing stupid in this country.
[19:58:38] <bjs> pyzozord: yes but do you see how there were "more" 2s in 12 than in 2
[19:58:49] <piou> Given the ongoing debate on whether there are many maths I thought this linguistic anomaly could be interesting
[19:58:54] <mrig> piou I understand it to be the study of that which manifests physically, is perceptible empirically.
[19:58:58] <bjs> pyzozord: by dividing by the common divisors you still have another 2 left over

[19:59:35] <mrig> to be polymath is to be well versed in several different schools.
[19:59:46] <pyzozord> bjs: but that would imply I need to store each divisor an array and compare arrays
[19:59:50] <piou> mrig: I didn't ask that properly, the question is more about singular versus plural and whether that plurality is present in the word itself
[19:59:51] <bjs> pyzozord: no it wouldn't
[20:00:17] <piou> mrig: geology is nice because it's clearly singular, but physics sounds plural
[20:00:28] <mrig> piou: I think that my answer indicates how this has changed over time.
[20:00:39] <bjs> pyzozord: the problem is that end up with (3*2, 1) but this "2" is common to b. If you could somehow divide away all the common divisors from a2 with b ...
[20:00:40] <mrig> polymath used to be a commonly used term.
[20:00:51] <mrig> some no longer recognise it.

[20:03:34] <mrig> an onomy relate to taxonomy, the naming of things. Though this grammatical nuance has been corrupted in recent times. 
[20:03:53] <mrig> import is very much the point.

[20:04:10] <pyzozord> bjs: right
[20:04:21] <mrig> but the language is dispersed, the grammar broken apart.
[20:04:33] <pyzozord> bjs: at the end of the loop I'm left with "rests" that no longer have common divisors
[20:04:34] <bjs> pyzozord: but what you have left over, still might have some common divisors with b.
[20:04:43] <mrig> to the extent now that in incites psychosis such as to create a new.

[20:05:10] <mrig> broken grammar is a curious thing.
[20:06:30] <mrig> piou: in direct response to your question; I have needed to mull thins over, I would have to say that to my mind physics is singular.
[20:06:41] <piou> thanks
[20:06:42] <bjs> pyzozord: with each other yes, but in your example can you see that you start with (a=2*2*3, b=2) the common divisors is 2. Once you divide you get (a2=2*3, b2=1) and there are no common divisors left.  *BUT* a2 still has common divisors with b.
[20:07:27] <pyzozord> yes I see, so that's where the false positive is triggered

[20:08:24] <bjs> pyzozord: in general if (a=2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2*3, b=2) then the common divisor here is 2. The problem is you have all those other 2's.  If you could somehow divide away *all* the 2s (because they're common with b...)

[22:19:19] <bjs> pyzozord: aha,  you fell into the same trap again.  By dividing both at once you end up eliminating the common factors
[22:20:10] <pyzozord> I experimented with gcd(4,6) and gcd(3,6) to 'break down' the last gdc of a,b
[22:20:31] <bjs> pyzozord: i'll just give a really big hint, here you have gcd==6, so you keep dividing by 6. But in doing so you end up with 4,3  == there are no common divisors left
[22:20:44] <bjs> but 4 (a2) still has common divisors with 18 (b)

[22:28:10] <bjs> it's not until the next day you feel acomplished 
[22:29:32] <pyzozord> do I understand correctly that dividing by gcd is like removing multiple prime factors, because every number eventually is made out of primes?
[22:30:18] <pyzozord> meaning, that's why I never have to check if something is a prime, because even if divide by 6, I actually divide by 2 and 3, which are both primes
[22:30:22] <bjs> pyzozord: yeah, like how 24 == 2*2*2*3
[22:30:47] <pyzozord> ok so I undertood that part at last
[22:30:49] <bjs> pyzozord: gcd(24,18) is 2*3 aka 6. 
[22:30:59] <pyzozord> *at least
[22:31:08] <bjs> it's the largest number you can divide both 24 and 18 by
[22:31:42] <pyzozord> yeah and doesn't matter what that number is, because it's some set of primes anyway, we don't need to know what primes, we just remove all primes that fit inside the current gcd

[22:32:16] <bjs> pyzozord: yes and that was the problem you had, in that 6 is {2,3} but it had the "wrong number" of 2s, so when you divide you're left with 2s still
[22:33:05] <pyzozord> I don't understand though why I couldn't [take care of the rests] after factoring a and b together in one loop
[22:33:43] <bjs> pyzozord: well the way you were doing it had a problem that once you divided both by 6, you were left with 4 and 3. Which share no common factors.

[23:34:55] <dodo> are you taking a poll, or do you want to ask them something?
[23:35:31] <InPhase> Dellawara: I'm certain there are many people here who speak German.  But there's also a "don't ask to ask" custom on IRC that results because people don't like to volunteer as subject matter experts for unspecified questions or requests.  :)
[23:35:35] <Dellawara> I want to ask them something
[23:35:57] <Dellawara> oh i see
[23:36:12] <pulse> InPhase, what if he asked if someone here spoke Bantu? :p
[23:36:31] <pulse> not sure i actually mean Bantu
[23:36:36] <pulse> i meant the one with clicks :P
[23:36:49] <InPhase> I'm not sure if any of the German speakers are reading along, but there are most definitely many in the channel just from a numbers game.
[23:37:18] <MrMobius> hmm, the channel rules dont say questions have to be in english. maybe ask and see?

[23:46:22] <Dellawara> Ich versuche mal mein Glück.^^ Kennt sich einer mit der PHP Skriptsprache aus? Es geht um verschachtelte for Schleifen, die eine Tabelle erzeugen. 
[23:46:39] <Inline> also Ich nicht!
[23:47:23] <DPA> Ich kann php.
[23:47:37] <dodo> you're still asking to ask. just show your code..

[23:56:30] <[itchyjunk]> what comes after learning recursion and such in a intro OOP class?
[23:56:46] <[itchyjunk]> feels like we've barely touched actual OOP so far so must be coming soon (tm)
[23:57:36] <InPhase> Recursion is somewhat orthogonal to OOP.
[23:57:47] <InPhase> So the question is a little confused.
[23:58:04] <InPhase> Is it an intro programming course taking an OOP approach?
