[02:18:36] <earthToAdam> dale... anything in emacs?
[02:18:44] <dale> You can annotate blocks as this-or-that language via classes in HTML, and Pandoc can use that IIRC, but if I'm sensing your use case correctly that won't help you since you don't control the HTML.
[02:19:49] <dale> earthToAdam: I guess you could try something like applying magic-mode-alist/magic-fallback-mode-alist.  Not sure how far that'll get you.
[02:20:07] <dale> Especially if it's just snippets of code, rather than a complete program.
[02:20:09] <earthToAdam> dale yeah, so I'm using JS to grab web snippets, that I want to pipe into a clippings.org file in emacs... I grab a lot of stuff from stackexchange, so it would be nice if the script could autodetect the language...

[02:22:33] <dale> earthToAdam: Ah, now, if it's Stack Exchange in particular, you might at least be able to read the language name from the <pre> or <code> tag's classes.  like I see <pre class="lang-sh ..."><code class="language-bash"> ... kind of thing here.
[02:23:05] <dale> Then you might be able to use something like a filter (?) in Pandoc to augment its parse tree with the language when decoding the HTML.  I've never tried that, but I think it's theoretically possible.
[02:24:26] *** Joins: AimHere (~David@vpn-fn-226.net.ed.ac.uk)
[02:24:28] <earthToAdam> dale that sounds perfect! If the language is tagged, I can autodetect and if not, I can let the user complete the field.
[02:24:44] <earthToAdam> Almost like a... polyfill :D
[02:25:00] <earthToAdam> Thanks Dale ;D
[02:25:46] <dale> Looks like Stack Exchange is using some library called highlight.js.  If you look for class="hljs language-$name" in (I guess?) code tags then you might be able to be even more general than just Stack Exchange, with something that can apply to any users of hljs.
[02:26:17] <dale> Oh, it seems like the hljs class is not necessary, perhaps.  https://highlightjs.org/usage/
[02:26:43] <dale> Seeing <code class="language-python"> is probably still a good indication that what comes next will indeed be Python, IMHO.

[09:33:26] <zeta_0[m]> I don't have the time to spend research this, so hopefully there's people in reddit's emacs channel that can help me.

[10:39:42] <dale> afidegnum: You could C-h v user-init-file RET and see what Emacs thinks your init file is, then make sure that you can read it as the user running Emacs.
[10:40:32] <afidegnum> ok
[10:42:53] <afidegnum> yes, it's still being detected
[10:42:58] <afidegnum> but not loaded
[10:43:56] <afidegnum> or does the init file needs to be compiled ?
[10:44:08] <afidegnum> since I activated the compilation feature
[10:49:54] <afidegnum> from what I just read, it seems the new version of emacs will not load the init file if .emacs.d directory exists
[10:50:21] <afidegnum> so I nad to rename it for a new dir to be created, then i can progressively reconstruct my init file

[13:26:22] <dale> If you go and put point inside that add-to-list form, C-M-x to evaluate it (or put point after the last closing paren and C-x C-e), then look at auto-mode-alist again, you should see your .tsx in there.
[13:26:53] <bobdobbs> sure thing

[13:32:22] <dale> Well, if you see the .tsx association at the top of auto-mode-alist now, I admit to being stumped.

[14:34:43] <mwnaylor> I only had a short run using git professionally, so I don't have best practices from mentoring/training. Using it to manage my elisp hacking. Regarding branches: is it better to merge a branch into the master or rebase the branch onto the master?
[14:35:01] <artefact> really really depends
[14:35:19] <artefact> it mostly boils down to project policy and personal workflow preference
[14:36:56] <artefact> i don't like rebasing, i'll even use merge --no-ff to have a history that reflects that some commits were part of a group merge. but some projects absolutely love a simple linear history
[14:37:10] <mwnaylor> I think I prefer merge, because that fits my mental model of whats taking place. A plus for me would be a merge message in the commit to let me know what happened.

[15:07:19] <mwnaylor> The power of the repl and a dynamic environment are great draws for lisp development (elisp, Clojure, etc.). But, I sometimes lose track of what I defined and where. Added to the mix, defvar only works the first time the buffer gets evaluated. I don't always remember to M-C-x (eval-defun EDEBUG-IT). I created this package that will scan an elisp source file and unbind all the defvars and defuns found in it.

[18:47:09] <pingpongball> what are chances of adding that modal editing features like today (god-mode, meow....... ) provides built it into emacs. although not activated by default like viper, but reside
[18:47:48] <pingpongball> would be fantastic , amazing if emacs would add this modal feature , no automatic but in there , and also remove viper :)
[18:48:35] <pingpongball> things have change people change,
[18:49:05] <jimeh> Personally for buffer management/switching I use tab-bar-mode to switch between different window configs, and typically I'll create a different window config for each "project" I'm working on, and I have keybindings quickly switch between tabs by index number or name, as well as next/preview, etc. Within a project I use consult-buffer to switch between open buffers, but with some tweaks so buffers related to the same project as the current buffer show first in...
[18:49:07] <pingpongball> while vim copied some features of emacs , why not emacs copy modal feature =D
[18:49:10] <jimeh> ... a "Project Buffers" consult group, and all other buffers show below it in a "Other Buffers" group. Oh, and I use projectile to determine what projects files/buffers belong to.

At that point I can probably extracate it from the game and try to package it up seperately.
[22:52:43] <corwin> I have the code for incrementally previewing a tile when editing it from org-mode when hovering the tile-name in the table, so the temptation wlll be to keep breaking it while I get more of the "edit from org or from SVG image view" features working.

[23:08:36] <spikemaster> that will get every face auctex defines.  It spreads them throughout several files
