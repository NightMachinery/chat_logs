So when you use !'' the ! operator will convert '' to a boolean value and because '' is falsy the value will be converted to false, after the conversion to boolean ! operator can perform his duty and negate the boolean

[05:21:26] <blahboybaz> Is there any way to guestimate how many object instances could be instantiated on a given machine? My laptop for example
[05:23:06] <arahael> blahboybaz: That lacks any context, but the answer is: A lot.  Way more than you can imagine.
[05:23:40] <arahael> blahboybaz: Generally, the limitation is not the number of objects, but what those objects are doing, their size, the runtime overheads, etcetera.
[05:23:52] <blahboybaz> Like 10K or a million?
[05:24:12] <AlexDelarge> write a program in $LANGUAGE to figure it out by testing
[05:24:32] <arahael> blahboybaz: Or many many billions.
[05:25:02] <blahboybaz> https://onecompiler.com/nodejs/3x567g5mt  <--  Wonder how mahy of those can fit in memory before my new lappy w/ 16G ram crashes or starts thrashing?
[05:25:13] <blahboybaz> arahael: Oh, like that
[05:25:16] <blahboybaz> cool
[05:25:49] <arahael> blahboybaz: Ah, so a *javascript* object.  A bit less, those are heavier.  But still.  A freaking huge number of them, especially if #_data and next are null.
[05:27:55] <blahboybaz> arahael: Yeah, just empty ones / null. I hope 10K wouldn't crash my computer. I guess I'll find out when then time comes. I thought it would be good to do a test with a big list (in addition to 0 nodes, 1 node, and 2 nodes)

[05:38:01] <blahboybaz> That's a lot
[05:38:06] <oldlaptop> amd64 machines don't have true 64-bit address spaces, at least so far, but they still have many, many more possible addresses than that, something like 2^48 as I recall.
[05:39:10] <oldlaptop> That corresponds to the "2GB" limit or (for most non-windows things on 32-bit-pointer machines like ia32) "4GB" limit you may have heard of for the amount of memory on a "32-bit" machine - each octet byte has its own address.

[05:41:25] <oldlaptop> any "64-bit" machine, even amd64 which doesn't actually have a 64-bit address space in practice (yet?), will have enough addresses to support much more RAM than is currently physically possible, but it's still useful in operating systems with virtual memory, because they can randomize the addresses as an exploit mitigation.

[13:33:51] <ZenixOwler> also guys, i am just trying to fast print a .db file, instead of writing a python program to print it out is there any fast utility to print it ?
[13:33:55] <ZenixOwler> like one-line
[13:34:07] <edgar-rft> piou: the name was "Elektor Junior Computer" -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektor_Junior_Computer

[13:35:10] <ZenixOwler> .db
[13:35:12] <[R]> ...
[13:35:18] <piou> ZenixOwler: that's an extension, not a format

[13:35:41] <piou> sqlite maybe?
[13:35:41] <edgar-rft> piou: it was very similar to the american KIM-1 -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIM-1
[13:35:45] <ZenixOwler> storing username and password only, it was created through sql_alchemy and i believe it also involves SQL
[13:35:51] <ZenixOwler> oh yes sqlite

[13:42:27] <OverCoder> hello
[13:42:29] <OverCoder> I am a JS dev
[13:42:44] <OverCoder> (and also a UI designer)
[13:42:49] <arahael> OverCoder: Condolences.
[13:42:53] <OverCoder> I'm looking for FOSS projects to contribute to that would make my resume stand out to someone that is interested in FOSS
[13:43:40] <OverCoder> now that someone might not be like, super technical
[13:43:46] <pyzozord> OverCoder: pick things that everyone knows, it's a marketing trick, human brain associated familiarity with quality
[13:43:50] <OverCoder> so they possibly are not familiar with something like node.js
[13:43:54] <OverCoder> yes
[13:44:01] <OverCoder> but what is something that everyone knows that is FOSS
[13:44:19] <ZenixOwler> piou: also is there any query which i can use to list all of the available tables ?

[13:45:43] <pyzozord> OverCoder: why would you pick neovim if you are a frontend dev looking to boost their cv
[13:45:49] <GeDaMo> Maybe Wikipedia?
[13:45:56] <piou> ZenixOwler: if you don't put a sql request after your command (so: sqlite3 my.db) you'll get an interractive shell. In there you can enter SQL but also get informations about the DB. You can do ".help" to get a list of sqlite specific features, which include ".tables" to list all tables and ".schema" to see what structure is used for a table.
[13:46:15] <pyzozord> wikipedia is a fantastic example, you'll boost your frontend cv and do something good in the world
[13:46:17] <OverCoder> because 1. I'm not a mere front-end dev 2. the resume is not going to attract an employer but actually a government employee that will give me a residency based on my programming competency

[13:58:37] <OverCoder> (I'm from Syria ICYMI)
[13:59:06] <OverCoder> arahael, actually know because most arab-made software is pretty sad and no one cares about quality
[13:59:07] <arahael> OverCoder: Saudi Arabic dates are pretty much in the 'too hard basket' for most devs.  Could be interesting if you can make supporting arabic dates much, much easier and to provide guidance on that.
[13:59:11] <OverCoder> so chances anyone will look for something niche like that is none
[13:59:39] <arahael> OverCoder: Yes, but other companies who want to get into that market may find it useful.

[14:00:59] <pyzozord> well anything localization in a browser will have similar effect

[14:02:10] <arahael> ^^ A great point.
[14:02:20] <arahael> And it means you can then be part of a "big, well known" project.
[14:02:38] <OverCoder> "those projects" refer to...?
[14:02:43] <pyzozord> and browsers are as complex as operating systems so it also showcases your technical skill

[14:03:23] <OverCoder> arahael, I kind of feel pretty disgusting to do any arabic stuff

[15:54:42] <arahael> ZenixOwler: The only regex I would bother with, frankly, is ^.*@.*$, and stripping whitespace.  And even that will filter away several valid email addresses.
[15:55:06] <ZenixOwler> well here is mine tho, not sure if there is any flaw in it : \w+@\w+(\.\w+)+

[16:37:51] <arahael> I think I can draw with the left, never really tried.  When painting i swap from hand to hand, though.

[16:44:31] <pulse> i always write stuff on the side with a pen whenever i'm programming

[16:45:01] <pulse> or even for sketching out data structures and architecture
[16:45:04] <arahael> Yeah - I always type.  Sometimes I like to draw, so I'll either do it in graphviz or... Use a pencil.
[16:45:19] <pulse> i find pen&paper invaluable when doing any sort of work
[16:45:36] <pulse> and i prefer that to purely digital notes because that way i maintain some connection to time and space
[16:46:12] <arahael> Actually if I'm trying to design a UI, which I do rarely and very badly, I do prefer to use pen and paper for that.

[16:56:26] <arahael> Heh, I can do that fine, too.  I really am ambidextrious.  It's the *really fine* motion sthat I've habitually always done with the right that don't transfer so well.

[17:52:43] <t3nj1n> any good books on programming concepts that are language agnostic?
[17:53:33] <t3nj1n> im finding a lot of books cover language features
[17:54:50] <InPhase> t3nj1n: Nearly every book on algorithms, data structures, or software engineering.  Except nearly all of them will feature a particular language as a means of describing the concepts, but the content is effectively agnostic in most of them.
[17:54:57] <pyzozord> t3nj1n: Elements of Programming by Kernigham

[17:56:41] <InPhase> t3nj1n: The secret is to just learn many languages, and learn to morph useful concepts between languages.
[17:58:17] <pyzozord> I recently learned trick how to make array deleted fast. Just copy the last element of the array in the place of the elemented you wanted to delete then decrese the array length by one
[17:58:25] <t3nj1n> alright that sounds good
[17:58:51] <pyzozord> s/array deleted fast/array deletes fast/
[17:59:35] <t3nj1n> When you say "useful concepts" could you give me an example?
[17:59:44] <beaky> yes many books and articles either use a 'pidgin algol' pseudocode where you're going to be expected to be both familiar with the more 'language-agnostic' ideas of structured programming like variables, procedures, conditionals, loops, and data, but in the pseudocode's own idiosyncratic way on top of any more informal 'cheats' like magical ... notation or some kind of minimization functions,
[17:59:46] <beaky> or they use a 'real language' where you get to learn and apply the real language even if its one considered 'academic' like the assembly knuth uses in his books or scheme used in sicp / htdp
[18:00:43] <t3nj1n> im finding that in a lot of books on algorithms it's got a sort of funny pseudocode that's not really pseudocode
[18:01:29] <arahael> One wonders why they don't just use an existing language that already has well defined semantics.
[18:02:32] <beaky> exactly its not really pseudocode its usually some very informal language model where you often wish 'dang i wish they used an actual language so i can know how this  "for i in 2,3,5,..." or very prosal "decide equality of x and y" step is really supposed to work)
[18:03:24] <beaky> and on the oposite end you get knuth's approach where you know exactly how everything runs but its in his own assembler language
[18:04:56] *** Joins: magla (~gelignite@55d493a6.access.ecotel.net)
[18:06:25] <beaky> but knuth's approach is the most honest one
[18:06:52] <arahael> I've only got one of his chapters, but it was a very nice read. :)
[18:07:14] <arahael> I keep it mostly as a collector's item, to be honest. Just the one chapter.
[18:10:52] <beaky> its the most honest because he's the only one who analyzes algorithmic complexity in the machine model while actually using the machine model to impelment the algorithm, whereas everyone else computer science uses the machine model for analysis, but they use an informal language model (pseudocode pidgin algol) to describe and implement everything, then informally unify the pseudocode with the
[18:10:53] <beaky> machine model for the purposes of anlayizing the algorithm https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/languages-and-machines/

[20:19:34] <AlexDelarge> there's a lot of software that does that.  my clipboard manager's internal editor supports it using that vim library
[20:20:04] <pyzozord> I have to say it really grew into me over the years, at this point normal editors honestly feel uncomfortable

[20:23:04] <piou> ed is nice, there's quite a lot to be learned by using it, but it would be so much better with syntax highlighting
[20:23:55] <pyzozord> line editing mode is slow, but it's also fun, especially if the line editing still has readline capabilities
[20:24:42] <AlexDelarge> ctrl-x e in bash pulls up the editor with the contents of the command line, and returns the edited text when you exit
[20:25:01] <AlexDelarge> ctrl-x ctrl-e i mean
[20:25:24] <pyzozord> but I imagine it worked much better when you could print out lines 0,400 and keep them next to your teletype when you were editing the lines. Screens have much less real estate

[20:33:46] <dodo> powerhouse_: which problem are you trying to solve?
[20:34:21] <powerhouse_> dodo, good question.  I want the smtp servers to be happy with one another
[20:34:35] <powerhouse_> dodo, email confirmation
[20:34:46] <dodo> smtp servers don't know about cookies?
[20:34:59] <dodo> so, like, a confirmation link?
[20:35:07] <dodo> that you send out by email?
[20:35:09] <powerhouse_> affirmative
[20:35:20] <dodo> don't need a cookie for that
[20:35:22] <piou> powerhouse_: the token that you send by email isn't a cookie, so that link isn't useful in your case
[20:35:29] <dodo> yeah
[20:35:49] <dodo> generate a token, store in your db, when url gets hit confirm the account or whatever you want to do
[20:37:25] <piou> powerhouse_: however it is a secret, so you must generate a random value of at least 128bits from cryptographic randomness. That sounds complicated but it just means "use random_bytes(16)" in php. Use the hexadecimal representation or base64 if you want it to be easy to use in the URL.

[21:11:56] <piou> powerhouse_: the process is quite simple: the client creates an account including an email address. The server generates a token (using random_bytes if you're using PHP) which is stored in the DB alongside this email address. It then builds an URL to the website with something like "https://mywebsite.com/email-verification?token=XXX_TOKEN_VALUE_XXX" and sends that URL in a mail to the client.
[21:12:02] <piou> When the client receives the mail and clicks the link the server receives a token. It can verify that this token exists in the DB and hasn't yet been claimed. If that is the case then the token is valid, the associated email is marked verified in the database and the token is removed as it is now invalid.
[21:13:02] <piou> powerhouse_: now, that can be a lot to implement, and it's quite sensitive. May I ask about your context? If you're not confident about implementing this you should probably use an integrated system rather than botching the security of your website and endangering your users.
[21:13:13] <GeDaMo> no_gravity: apparently the replace string can be a function

[22:22:26] <usr123> I was going through a book that's teaching me to implement oauth. I'm using gomniauth library for the same. I read that when any provider let's the user sign in, a code is sent along with the redirect url that we provide, then our app uses this code to get a token to get all further information from the provider. How does this work when I have more than one machine? One of my servers will get the token but the other server might not.
[22:22:49] <usr123> So how do I sync up the servers so all of them have the token?

[22:31:29] <pyzozord> I'm not sure but I think keeping the user on single server until the end of the user session is the more popular approach

[23:59:19] <Valware> oxytocin is mainly a chemical reaction to sexual cues, is it not o.o
