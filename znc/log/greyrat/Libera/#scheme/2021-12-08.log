[00:49:09] <mdhughes> You can't store 2^64 bytes in anything because the Earth only contains 1.3e50 atoms, and you'll need at least 8 per byte, plus a large amount of infrastructure.
[00:50:29] <mdhughes> If you tore up the Solar System and reassembled the planets into a laser-pumped memory grid like core memory, you might be able to hold 2^64. Access time would be in hours from light-speed delays.
[00:50:31] <gwatt> 1.3E50 is significantly more than 2^64
[00:51:44] <gwatt> 2^64 is about 1E20

[01:18:46] <gwatt> probably not
[01:20:07] <fizzie> 2^64 *bits* is just two exabytes, and there's definitely more data than that in the world.
[01:20:34] <fizzie> Seagate has shipped enough hard drives to store 3 zettabytes, according to their blog.
[01:21:35] <gwatt> Oh, I'm not saying 2^64 words of memory is unattainable, just probably not on a single computer.
[01:22:09] <fizzie> Yeah, that was just re "in anything".

[17:46:07] <amazigh> IIRC MNW recommends UUIDs
[17:47:02] <amazigh> at least with UUIDs, you can recreate the very same record in another library (in the rare event you need it), that feature is used in weinholt's reader 
[17:47:51] <amazigh> I do not recall the name of the library, but Chez has a special record object for annotations, and making the same annotations from outside would not be possible without
[17:48:04] <taylan> the idea of using UUIDs in human-readable code really irks me to be honest.  reverse DNS sounds like a good idea for long-lasting unique names that are also expected to be human-readable.
[17:48:30] <amazigh> hey taylan :)
[17:48:43] <amazigh> You use the UUID once at the place where the record is created
[17:50:01] <amazigh> One might argue that objects <myrecord> as in (define-record <myrecord> ...) and exporting <myrecord> would be enough
[17:50:45] <amazigh> the above proposal with <myrecord> does not help with serializing / deserializing

[19:21:00] <amazigh> Regarding `eval` and environments, so it is not standard to reify an environme (tho mit and guile do it)
[19:21:57] <amazigh> What happens is supposed to happen when one does something like (eval `(write ,myvariable) (environment '(scheme base)))
[19:23:01] <amazigh> it is missing `(scheme write) but you get the idea
[19:28:43] <amazigh> with a lambda closure, it is possible to create some kind of environment:
[19:28:53] <amazigh> > (define myenv (eval `(lambda (symbol) (case symbol ((mybv) ,mybv))) (environment '(scheme base))))
[19:28:54] <amazigh> > (myenv 'mybv)
[19:28:56] <amazigh> #u8(#x01 #x02 #x03 #x2A)
[19:30:38] <amazigh> To implement (current-environment) it would require to scrape the lexical scope at compile time
[19:38:50] <amazigh> it seems to me it is possible to bridge the gap between Kernel and Scheme
[19:39:19] <amazigh> first thing first remove the $ in variable names
[19:41:09] <amazigh> i need to read the Kernel report (again!)
[19:41:53] <amazigh> There is strange behavior where they can define SOMETHING in terms of its previous binding, without renaming it beforehand.
[19:45:30] <amazigh> $vau in terms of $vau with an implicit sequence (aka. begin in scheme) 
[19:45:40] <amazigh> https://git.sr.ht/~amirouche/sink-kernel/blob/master/subfiles/library.snk  
[19:49:09] <amazigh> I do not understand why / how $vau with $sequence does not end up with an infinite loop
[19:55:19] <sham1> One thing that annoys me is that there is no way of creating an empty environment that is also mutable
[19:55:54] <amazigh> sham1: with R7RS?
[19:57:12] <sham1> Yes
[19:58:11] <amazigh> oh uh ah! (environment '(scheme base)) does return an environment indeed, so there is the notion of reified environment in R7RS; and current-environment is not-standard.
[19:58:55] <amazigh> return an environment object, but it has no predicate that satisfy it e.g. environment?
[19:59:56] <sham1> Yeah, and all of (environment), (scheme-report-environment) and (null-environment) are immutable. For some things that's all you need, but it would be nice to also have a (standard) way of making an environment one could for example (define) stuff, that isn't (interaction-environment)
[20:00:27] <sham1> I think that it would be good for some kind of sandboxing
[20:01:49] <amazigh> why not create a new environment?
[20:01:54] <amazigh> from the previous one?
[20:03:10] <amazigh> speaking of mutable, I was thinking that all mutations on environment in kernel-on-r7rs-scheme will not be easy to implement without some interpretation overhead
[20:03:54] <amazigh> mutating the caller environment would require some kind of trickery
[20:04:14] <amazigh> e.g. boxing the mutated variable.
[20:06:42] *** Joins: pranavats (3fba1d1b34@2a00:c70:1:178:170:40:189:1)
[20:07:13] <amazigh> re $vau-with-sequence-of-expr-as-body in terms of $vau is an error as defined in library.snk, even if, I mean especially if you consider that all bodies are letrec*, that works with sink, because the SINK REPL emulate a letrec*
[20:12:47] <amazigh> There is many thing interesting with K-1RK, but current-environment seems the most important part, and whether the returned environment is mutable or not. (refied continuations with disjoint type are also neat..)
[20:19:37] <amazigh> Then one can implement a form `vau`, prefix all calls with `vau-call` that will dispatch depending on whether the combiner is an operative or applicative, in many cases vau-call can be dropped at compile time, since most callable will be applicatives aka. Scheme procedures.
