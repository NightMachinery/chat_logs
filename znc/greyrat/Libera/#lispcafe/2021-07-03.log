[04:39:38] <gilberth> hayley: Yes, I had this hunch. Though the spec says, that duplicates are ok. And: When I say (remove-duplicates (apropos-list "")) in CCL, it is 133x faster. So SBCL is pretty slow :-p
[04:39:55] <hayley> Well, LIST-DELETE-DUPLICATES* does not use a hash table but L-REMOVE-D* does. 
[04:39:57] <gilberth> Sure, you were kidding.

[04:42:35] <gilberth> Which are 14 of them, and only three have a macro expander.
[04:43:06] <hayley> DELETE takes a long time, REMOVE takes 804ms, nothing takes 786ms.

[04:45:50] <gilberth> hayley: SBCL has 32k symbols to grok, CCL has 45k, remove-duplicates on those 45k takes 150ms.
[04:47:02] <hayley> SBCL is faster at REMOVE-DUPLICATES at least, if the difference between that and not doing that is 18ms. And I expect hash lookup to be O(1)-ish so it would not be much slower with 13k more elements.

[05:25:03] <hayley> Note that SICL hash tables have random permutations for hash functions (which makes its :hash-function incompatible with everyone else's FWIW).

[05:26:48] <gilberth> hayley: I consider this a minor issue.
[05:27:27] <hayley> I consider it sufficiently broken as even your dear REMOVE-DUPLICATES can become slower for no reason with unfortunate input.
[05:27:52] <gilberth> Could happen with salt too.
[05:29:01] <hayley> Hm, perhaps we should change the hash function's initial state on resize too. In the context of a concurrent hash table where only some operations tend to "block" threads then you have to have one value per table state, but it could work.
[05:30:00] <hayley> At this point I'm pretty sure that my good table w.o. metadata is only slower than Click's because we can't rely on a JVM that inlines test and hash functions for us.
[05:30:29] <dave0> so what happens? you start your program and it picks a random number for the hash function? so each run makes a different hash table layout?
[05:30:43] <hayley> Yes.
[05:31:03] <dave0> ok
[05:31:34] <gilberth> I would rather prefer that you could hash a subseq/substring. That would be a performance gain.
[05:32:53] <hayley> What is the key that you store then? The <string, start, end> triple?
[05:33:18] <gilberth> No, a copy. For #'EQUAL.
[05:33:48] <gilberth> As the string would change, because it's my input buffer.
[05:33:50] <hayley> Okay, so we copy still. Or just on writes?
[05:34:10] <gilberth> On writes only.
[05:35:00] <gilberth> Consider any parser: Most identifiers encountered would be known.

[06:54:40] <hayley> I think they use hooks designed for emulation.
[06:57:41] <hayley> Still confused as to how you make EQ work with incremental copying/moving. Say two threads have a reference to oldspace, which might be read-protected even. If one loads it, evidently some barrier will fire and the reference will be fixed up. But the other one will have a reference to oldspace still.
[06:59:11] <hayley> ZGC uses a load barrier, which can't be enforced by MMU because we're testing bits in a reference which we got out of an object, not one we loaded.
[07:08:00] <hayley> Aha, Appel mentions it in https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/andrew-appel/real-time-gc.pdf which does abuse the MMU in a "normal" way.

[07:18:34] <gilberth> mmap your memory from the same fd => shared, but possibly with different protection.
[07:18:42] <hayley> gilberth: I mean that our mutator and collector threads would share memory, but the mutator would (usually) not be able to read or write protected pages - oh okay.
[07:19:39] <hayley> There is a local mmap, right? So that we could also have them at the same addresses.
[07:20:43] <gilberth> Yes. From the documentation. Never tried that.
[07:21:48] <gilberth> Before there was clone(2), I proposed to mmap the same fd for multithreading, and that works. Bruno didn't like that either.
[07:23:02] <gilberth> But then at that time Linus had the idea, that there should be no thread local store at all. Registers? Also shared? The program counter even? Silly.
[07:23:21] * hayley can't find any details on what processors support Intel MPK/PKU. Bet it's not any of hers.
[07:23:29] <gilberth> Anyhow, I have not yet figured out how to mmap negative addresses.
[07:23:54] <gilberth> With Linux, that is.
[07:25:51] <gilberth> hayley: You could also play with segment registers^W^Wdescriptors for different permissions. Heck, XENIX made the stack practically non-executable this way, before there was the NX bit.
[07:26:24] <hayley> FWIW how do I detect that crap? Nothing in /proc/cpuinfo about it.
[07:26:40] <gilberth> No?
[07:27:39] <hayley> Oh well, I will stick to plain MMU buggering until it is actually possible to figure out if it exists or not.
[07:28:04] <gilberth> In fact the whole damn data segment was non-executable, you needed to make syscall to get hold of an executable chunk.
[07:28:55] <gilberth> hayley: You'd need my bare-metal long-mode stuff. *sigh*
[07:29:46] <gilberth> Even Go manages to get negative addresses, I'd need to browse the code.
[07:34:25] <hayley> So TL/DR Appel protects all of fromspace and the trap handler fixes up references to fromspace in a page before unprotecting it. Though doesn't that mean that any garbage on a page is copied and kept live? 
[07:36:37] * hayley contemplates using the scheme to make Immix actually incremental, because no, reference counting is not incremental anywhere anyone should care.
[07:38:00] <hayley> But the occurrence of wasteful copying should be much rarer, because Immix only copies sufficiently fragmented pages.

[13:16:04] <White_Flame> it's also crazy in the USA how whenever somebody's preferred party has the presidency, they think the president should be able to have dicatatorial powers, and when the opposing party is in, the president should have no power, and yell about it every administration

[13:25:07] <gilberth> But censorship was attempted here for at least 20 years, I wonder why.
[13:25:46] <White_Flame> from an external perspective, lots of guilt-based censorship of any vestiges of naziism
[13:26:57] <gilberth> White_Flame: Well, it's forbidden to show Nazi symbols like the swastika. But the new censorship is not about that at all.
[13:27:23] <White_Flame> right, but I assume that is what opened the floodgates for all the other censorship
[13:27:31] <gilberth> Quite the opposite actually.
[13:30:30] <gilberth> The last "real" attempt was in like 2008 or so, where the state would issue a list of "child porn" sites to ISPs with the obligation to "block" those via DNS. Scandinavia did that briefly before. The Swedish, IIRC, list leaked. No child porn there, but anarchist/far-left sites, whistle blower related stuff and the like.
[13:32:11] <gilberth> However this prompted me to have my own BIND.
[13:35:29] <hayley> Yeah, seems that any censorship is either protecting children, preventing terrorism, or avoiding spreading CP (a subset of the first, sure, but to me the first is more or less stopping your kid from watching violent stuff on the interwebs).

The list of all who signed was downloadable as a file. You'd find my name on it.
[13:59:13] <gilberth> hayley: Censorship is "Zensur" in German (remember it for when you move over). The minister who wanted that law is Ursula von der Leyen. She was called "Zensurula" then. And the "Laie" (Leye?!) is the unknowledgeable person. Figure.

[16:38:01] <hayley> Is there much of a difference between having a basically guaranteed to fire read barrier doing fix up work and a STW doing fix up work?
[16:39:12] <White_Flame> icache pressure always comes to mind, but I'm not sure how much of an issue that is in reality
[16:39:17] <hayley> IIRC some Shenandoah dev said in a presentation that C4 fixing up was basically a pause, and I think my plan might be similar.
[16:39:38] <White_Flame> also, I guess you're doing more testing in a read barrier every time than every once in a while in the STW
[16:40:02] <hayley> The read barrier is a MMU trap. Say that we clear out things per page too.
[16:40:07] <White_Flame> ah
[16:41:02] <hayley> That is how Appel did Baker's copying GC on a stock Unix machine. Though I want to use the barrier for the defragging in Immix which is less frequent.
[16:41:55] <hayley> But still, every page has to be scanned for pointers to fix up before we can make them readable, so I am not sure if there is a benefit.
[16:44:09] <hayley> We might say that NonBlockingHashMap does "page" by page copying, but it is more incremental than pausing. But then you aren't hitting one table as much as you're hitting a whole heap.
[17:00:00] <gilberth> Haha, read carefully: <https://franz.com/support/documentation/ansicl.94/subsubsu/useofthe.htm> Do you spot the dot?

[18:25:33] * hayley wonders if someone actually read the Immix paper.
[18:25:43] <hayley> "The small object space follows the Immix memory layout, minus compaction (opportunistic evacuation) that would require a fully precise GC capable to perfectly identify references in both allocations and stacks."
[18:26:08] <hayley> So, you can always just pin the pages that are referenced on stack and allow compacting/evacuating everything else.
[18:27:18] <hayley> For a concurrent GC I figure we would rather keep the read barrier off as long as possible, and it affects the whole heap, so we'd presumably want to batch up defragging too.
[18:35:53] <hayley> FWIW the algorithm reuses 128B "lines", but if there are enough of those which are barely used but not free, then we do an incremental copy I suppose.
