[00:37:09] <fizzie> Because lvalue conversion drops qualifiers, I imagine.
[00:38:05] <fizzie> C11 6.3.2.1p2: "Except [unrelated exceptions], an lvalue that does not have array type is converted to the value stored in the designated object (and is no longer an lvalue); -- If the lvalue has qualified type, the value has the unqualified version of the type of the lvalue; --"
[00:39:22] <fizzie> So the expression `var`, in that context (generic selection is not an exception to lvalue conversion), has the (unqualified) type `struct mystruct`, but the generic selection association list does not contain that type; it contains `mystruct_t`, which is another name for `const struct mystruct`, the qualified type.

[03:06:18] <wstrnr> you shouldn't write code like  char var = getc(...);  it should be  int var = ...; 
[03:06:52] <fizzie> You get rid of a '\n' in the input stream by reading it (for example, with getc) and then discarding the result.
[03:06:53] <wstrnr> overflow of char, and it will undeniably happen in case of EOF, is undefined behavior
[03:08:11] <owensjrw> char or int -- getc is still reading the newline when return is pressed. char should only store a single variable of 0 to 254 am I correct? Why is it keeping the '\n' like a second call?
[03:08:39] <fizzie> The input is a stream. If you type "x\n", then the first call will return the 'x', and the second call the '\n', and the third call whatever comes after that.
[03:09:22] <fizzie> If you type "foo\n", the first call will return 'f', the second 'o', the third another 'o', the fourth the '\n'. Where you put the characters, and what you do with them, doesn't affect what's in the input / what getc will return.
[03:10:10] <owensjrw> Here is my example, the request was to write a tic-tac-toe game without using any self-defined functions. https://code.sololearn.com/c4LTe8DtmyTd/#c you can see the second call after a user enters a valid square.

[03:12:04] <fizzie> If you want to read just the first character of the line the user inputs, and discards the rest, you will have to... read the first character, and discard the rest.
[03:13:01] <fizzie> For example, with something like: `square = getc(stdin); while (unused = getc(stdin), unused != EOF && unused != '\n') /* do nothing */;`
[03:13:23] <fizzie> Or you could choose to ignore all whitespace, which sort of naturally takes care of any newlines as well.

[03:14:37] <caze> lol
[03:15:06] <owensjrw> Yes, I dont know why that was the request caze.
[03:15:25] <fizzie> With a `do square = getc(stdin); while (isspace(square));` or whatnot, which will just repeat the getc call until there's a non-whitespace input character. That's what most scanf conversion specifiers do, for example. Or you could read entire lines -- people expect terminal interfaces to be line-oriented, not character-oriented.
[03:15:37] <caze> owensjrw: Do you realize that '\n' is a character?
[03:16:30] <caze> owensjrw: So like, if you're using getc to read input, and you want to ignore anytime the user enters the character 'a', how would you do it?
[03:16:30] <owensjrw> Yes all the escape chars are chars -- I am sure my language is incorrect there though.

[03:18:24] <owensjrw> while(getc(stdin) != '\n') {var = getc(stdin);} is this not going to still read the \n
[03:18:41] <caze> owensjrw: Perhaps you should start with the K&R book.
[03:18:51] <fizzie> Don't do _that_.
[03:19:04] <wstrnr> by the way, instead of writing getc(stdin) you can write getchar()
[03:19:32] <caze> You probably don't want to discard all the characters, also.

[03:30:55] <owensjrw> No its not an exercise in K&R. One of the discussion questions on SoloLearn (Usually students asking for help) Posted "how can i make tic tac toe (x-o-x) game without using functions in c language?"
[03:31:24] <caze> I mean, main is a function. That you have to define.
[03:31:26] <Bruda> Ah. I have Sololearn. Need to dive into that and try the C course sometime.

[13:01:37] <ghenry> morning all
[13:02:02] <ghenry> Got a weird bug in my project that shows itself on the second run of "make check"
[13:02:02] <ghenry> free(): corrupted unsorted chunks

[13:03:27] <ghenry> In each test I open my sqlite db, finalize and close
[13:03:34] <ghenry> in my last test I remove the db.
[13:03:51] <ghenry> Seems I'm closing the db in an inconsistent state
[13:04:12] <ghenry> but this doesn't fail: 	assert_int_equal(sqlite3_close(db), SQLITE_OK);
[13:04:23] <ghenry> I'll ask in sqlite, as I don't think this is my C.

[17:25:11] <dacav> Ethical (?) question about globals.  Globals are generally evil, and thre must be a good reason to use one.  That being said, let's consider the case of a library that makes use of globals.  It is probably not thread safe.  Would you see any drawback in turning all its global into thread-locals?

[17:29:25] <mort> dacav: yeah, I think so
[17:29:43] <mort> you would probably use more memory because with N threads, there'd be N copies of everything
[17:30:07] <mort> accessing thread-local storage feels more complicated than accessing global memory, if that's true then it might slow things down a bit if there's more to do for every access
[17:30:29] *** Joins: gh34 (~textual@cpe-184-58-181-106.wi.res.rr.com)
[17:31:16] <mort> I feel like the errors would be more confusing if you access the library from more threads and it's not built for it if it sort of "works" but all the threads see a different kind of library, I would rather want it to just break or have races which are caught by the thread sanitizer
[17:32:13] <mort> I might be wrong tho, idk - but I don't see a point, if the library isn't meant to be thread-safe and has global state it's probably a bug to call it from multiple threads regardless, and if you call it from only one thread it doesn't really matter

[17:34:19] <dacav> Yes, I think I'd probably try to see if it makes sense to have a dedicated thread to use the library, and work as a gatekeeper to it.
[17:35:30] <dacav> It might end up being the bottleneck (all of this is hypotethical), and then I might consider the idea of thread-localit

[19:40:12] <floatcomplex> river: "configure" isn't actually the problem. there are configure scripts that have nothing to do with autotools. musl's for example
[19:40:46] <yanmaani> river: sounds like you need meson
[19:40:59] <river> I just said I dont like meson?
[19:41:04] <BtbN> meson has so far been worse then autotools in my experience
[19:41:12] <yanmaani> river: my actual goal is to write software in C with decent security assurances
[19:41:17] <BtbN> So many random issues because someone just didn't think of your usecase...
[19:41:28] <river> yanmaani: why does it have to be c?
[19:41:37] <floatcomplex> in my perfect world, "configure" looks at the directory full of source code, and takes zero or one arguments, the one being what target environment you're cross compiling for, and with those two sources of information, writes a makefile. there should not need to be a project-specific makefile.in or cmakelists or any such file that tells the build system what to do
[19:42:28] <BtbN> So, what if you have optional dependencies?
[19:42:29] <floatcomplex> yanmaani: you can do it, just not the entire program. you can write the safety-critical parts in a subset of C with provable semantics
[19:42:48] <floatcomplex> and then document the shit out of the interfaces between those parts and the rest of the code
[19:43:06] <floatcomplex> and the rest of the code and the rest of the system which it's operating within, which you didn't write
[19:43:07] <yanmaani> river: cause I like C. I could do it in Rust, but I bloody hate it
[19:43:28] <river> BtbN: if you have optional dependencies then something needs to take flags to explain that, and #defines need to be set and so on..
[19:43:34] <yanmaani> what I don't understand is why you couldn't just do sometihng like Clang's thread safety analyzer
[19:43:40] <yanmaani> and it could divide the code up into 2 sections:
[19:43:50] <floatcomplex> yanmaani: in another 5-10 years maybe that will be commonplace
[19:43:53] <river> but we do not need 25k lines of auto**** scripts to implement this
[19:43:57] <yanmaani> 1) provably secure, this here can never be a nullptr so this other part can never be ...
[19:44:10] <BtbN> river, the 25k lines are generated. You don't write them...
[19:44:12] <yanmaani> 2) ehhhhhh idk bro, maybe put a few asserts in
[19:44:15] <floatcomplex> river: yeah we absolutely don't, that's an artefact of a pre-posix world that doesn't exist anymore
[19:44:19] <yanmaani> floatcomplex: Rust? God I hope not
[19:44:25] <river> BtbN: I know :P
[19:44:28] <floatcomplex> yanmaani: ???
[19:44:31] <BtbN> And I think you have never worked with a big project, if you think a few defines can solve that.
[19:44:41] <floatcomplex> yanmaani: i meant in 5-10 years clang tsan will be able to do that
[19:45:02] <river> well I think thats my cue to dip
[19:45:21] <BtbN> There's a shitton of difference architectures, compilers, OS, versions of dependencies, that need different code, ...
[19:45:23] <pragma-> river: see you on the dip side
[19:45:39] <BtbN> Saying "Yeah just write a simple shell script" or something is silly
[19:45:44] <floatcomplex> BtbN: i think there's a dividing line to be made between "optional dependencies" and "the target environment"
[19:46:06] <BtbN> You need to manage both of it. And that shit just is insanely complex. Hence all the build systems have grown so complex.
[19:46:06] <floatcomplex> one can resolve all of the necessary branches about the target environment in a project-agnostic way
[19:46:25] <BtbN> It's not like anyone sat down and said to themselves "yeah, let's make something ridiculously hyper complex for fun"
[19:47:34] <floatcomplex> sure, but it's made of problems that are individually simple to reason about, and become complex when inappropriate interconnects are allowed to exist, even mentally. allowing resolution of optional dependencies, and resolution of target-specific build behaviour, to have any interplay, is unnecessary complexity

[20:12:57] <rcf> autotools doesn't count 
[20:13:03] <floatcomplex> meson isn't a complete thing either
[20:13:14] <rcf> As it is not portable to non-POSIX 
[20:13:16] <BtbN> Whatever that is supposed to mean
[20:13:35] <kaichiuchu> how would autotools not count
[20:13:35] <BtbN> autotools works fine everywhere a shell works. Including Windows with msvc.
[20:14:08] <kaichiuchu> i would say if you were writing a new project, the safest thing to do would be to sadly use cmake
[20:14:17] <kaichiuchu> and I say sadly because CMake isn't fantastic

[20:14:33] <BtbN> Depends a lot on the project. For a very simple thing, a Makefile is plenty.
[20:14:47] <BtbN> But the moment it gets more complex, you need some more involved build system.
[20:15:07] <kaichiuchu> i would think most software falls under the more complex category
[20:15:14] *** Joins: mahmutov (~mahmutov@37.155.40.37)
[20:15:31] <kaichiuchu> but sadly, there's really no good solution at the moment
[20:15:34] <floatcomplex> sigh
[20:15:59] <floatcomplex> cmake and meson could be great but they don't go far enough
[20:16:05] <BtbN> Hating on stuff that's sometimes annoying to deal with is nice and easy.
[20:16:21] <floatcomplex> if cmake worked without the existence of cmakelists.txt i would be really excited about it
[20:16:33] <kaichiuchu> a lot of people think I'm crazy but I don't like the idea of having to write my own build system files
[20:16:40] <BtbN> How on earth would it magically work without anyone telling it what to do?
[20:17:06] <floatcomplex> BtbN: by looking at the fucking source code
[20:17:18] <kaichiuchu> i'd rather just use a GUI, whether it'd be an ncurses one or a Qt one and just model the project that way
[20:17:30] <BtbN> And then have some "AI magic" determine how you want it compiled, into a library? Or a binary? Multiple libraries? With which compiler flags?
[20:17:55] <kaichiuchu> the main problem I have with CMake is it's a case of "nobody is invalidated, but nobody is right"
[20:18:07] <floatcomplex> all properties of either the source or the desired target environment
[20:18:17] <kaichiuchu> you're not supposed to touch build flags EVER according to every source out there, but if you want to enable warnings you have no choice
[20:18:26] <floatcomplex> the build-time needs of a given dependency are a function of that dependency, not of software that uses it
[20:18:33] <kaichiuchu> because there's still even after 20 years of CMake's existence no way to set in the properties if you want warnings enabled
[20:18:54] <floatcomplex> the project shouldn't have to tell the build system how to compile dependency A, if every project that uses A does the same thing

[20:19:11] <floatcomplex> or should
[20:19:15] <rcf> With C you can't actually be sure of that. 
[20:19:16] <BtbN> What? Why would the build system tell you how to compile a dependency?
[20:19:25] <kaichiuchu> yeah I don't get that
[20:19:33] <BtbN> Have you ever actually used any of the build systems you are hating on here?
[20:19:43] <floatcomplex> how to link a dependency rather
[20:20:04] <floatcomplex> BtbN: yes, and cmake is a fucking pain in the ass when trying to cross compile anything
[20:20:14] <BtbN> Not really?
[20:20:23] <BtbN> I'm doing that a lot in fact, and it works seamlessly
[20:20:25] <floatcomplex> the way to make it work is project specific, and shouldn't be
[20:20:27] <kaichiuchu> you're supposed to use toolchain files
[20:20:28] <rcf> With CMake, the question then becomes "Which CMake?" 
[20:20:34] <BtbN> floatcomplex, no, it's really not.
[20:20:43] <kaichiuchu> and once they're set up, it pretty much works flawlessly
[20:20:45] <rcf> Because it has a hurge amount of technical debt that is invoked with older projects 
[20:20:46] <floatcomplex> you got lucky with what project you're tasked with compiling, then
[20:20:57] <BtbN> lol

[20:21:41] <BtbN> Quick check says my build scripts deal with 15 cmake based projects
[20:21:54] <BtbN> they all just work with the exact same toolchain file.
[20:22:06] <BtbN> cmake actually abstracts that away very nicely
[20:22:34] <rcf> In the world of terrible enterprise or embedded software, that is not a sufficient sample size. The versatility means that some idiot is going to break that abstraction needlessly. 
[20:22:52] <rcf> Though that's not really CMake's fault.

[20:23:04] <BtbN> but that's true universally, and not a trait or fault of cmake or any other build system

[20:23:14] <BtbN> That argument is nonsensical
[20:23:29] <BtbN> Example ffmpeg: We have 100+ optional dependencies, create 7 libraries, 5+ binaries, all linked together in very particular ways. Good luck automagically doing that without ANY build instructions
[20:23:33] <floatcomplex> you have a directory of source code, and a toolchain file
[20:23:41] <floatcomplex> that should be sufficient
[20:23:46] <rcf> I would like to see a build system that operates without any configuration of anything generate sensible output. 
[20:23:46] <BtbN> Yeah, no.
[20:23:52] <rcf> That doesn't happen. 
[20:24:18] <kaichiuchu> what I'm hearing is you're hoping the wind blows your boat to your destination without steering it at all
[20:24:20] <BtbN> If your build is as simple as "build all these C files, and link them into a binary", sure. But that's... a very narrow special case.
[20:24:25] <kaichiuchu> the wind is important, but steering is even more important
[20:24:42] <floatcomplex> BtbN: you would argue that there is a sensibly written non-shit cmakelists.txt right
[20:24:55] <floatcomplex> and a procedure for writing it without fucking up
[20:25:01] *** Quits: Itaru (~DaSH@ro2.flokinet.is) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[20:25:07] <floatcomplex> now just script that procedure
[20:25:17] <BtbN> I couldn't name a project that has a seriously broken CMakeList right now. But I can name a lot that work just fine.
[20:25:35] <BtbN> How on earth do you want to automagically "script that procedure"
[20:25:37] <kaichiuchu> "just script that procedure" which is probably going to be specific to one particular system
[20:26:00] <kaichiuchu> vs using cmake where it can generate stuff for you
[20:26:17] <floatcomplex> kaichiuchu: read it again...
[20:26:35] <BtbN> By far the worst cmake setup I've delt with recently is the Vulkan-Stuff. The people there can't do shit right. And even their stuff generally just works for cross compiling.
[20:26:46] <BtbN> +a
[20:27:21] <BtbN> So I think you're just cherry picking one unnamed bad example, which could be any random build system, and generalize it to push your point.
[20:28:16] <rcf> I'll say that I fucking hate autotools with every fiber of my being in every context I've ever encountered it, but when I've had issues with meson or cmake the manual intervention required to fix them hasn't made writing some complicated autogeneration script specific for each platform seem like a worthwhile use of my time. 
[20:28:37] <kaichiuchu> autotools sucks, yeah

[20:31:26] <BtbN> Package management is very much not the job of a build system
[20:31:31] <kaichiuchu> because then I can say "my dependency requires sdl2" and then it'll grab it for me
[20:31:37] <kaichiuchu> if it doesn't already exist that is
[20:31:37] <rcf> Well, it'd be fine if everything is statically linked.

[20:33:36] <kaichiuchu> that's what fetchcontent does for me
[20:33:48] <BtbN> That's not what you just said.

[20:34:03] <kaichiuchu> no, I said it'll grab it for me
