[18:17:16] <skye0_mobile> Myself: I kind of want clear plastic to be a thing but people tend to hate plastic these days even on products that cost more on the environment than plastic alone, and transparent plastic looks "fragile" to many 
[18:17:50] * skye0_mobile thinks about a cracked plastic tub to store food in
[18:19:00] <skye0_mobile> apparently I've also heard glass is bad for the environment too 
[18:23:08] <superkuh> Glass is the environment around here. Sandstone.
[18:25:54] <skye0_mobile> broken glass is terrible on animals, us included. I'm a bit annoyed people seem to love smashing glass bottles where I live 
[18:26:43] <skye0_mobile> yes, booze is good but please don't make a cyclist or driver have to replace a flat tire

[18:41:42] <ThePendulum> hmm making glass might be bad for the environment, not sure if glass itself is apart from the mechanical damage of being sharp
[18:43:34] <ThePendulum> glass on land does seem bad for that reason, in the ocean I'm not sure how much harm it can do

[23:21:18] <Myself> Seems like it's pretty minor compared to most other materials. Metals take heat and special atmospheres and sometimes staggering amounts of electrical current (look up how aluminum smelters work!), and you're fighting oxidation the whole time. And then they'll recycle themselves in short order unless you cover them in paints which are their own
