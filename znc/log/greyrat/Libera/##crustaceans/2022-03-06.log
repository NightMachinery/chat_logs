[02:30:08] <gerikson> dead within seconds, it's hard being a Russian troll these days:
[02:30:10] <gerikson> ``Genuinely not trolling. Why is Ukraine fighting back against Russia? Is it because the US and NATO countries are giving Ukrainians weapons and instigating for Ukraine to fight back? Seems like unnecessary bloodshed, especially considering your opponent (Russia -- a world superpower). I've tried searching Google to see who else has asked that, but I can't seem to find good results anywhere.''
[02:33:31] <companion_cube> :D right
[02:33:31] <river> i have actually wondered this..... why fight a losing battle
[02:33:40] <companion_cube> because it's not necessarily losing
[02:34:44] <wrl> yep
[02:35:12] <companion_cube> also, no one likes rolling over to dictators without a fight, I guess
[02:36:55] <ngoldbaum> what happened last time ukraine put their trust in the russians: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor
[02:36:55] <buttsbot> Holodomor - Wikipedia
[02:43:16] <gerikson> tbh I thought this war would be over by now and the Russians would have killed Zelenskyy, installed a puppet government, and declared Ukraine "neutral"
[02:43:34] <companion_cube> definitely, and their resistance is impressive
[03:09:01] <gerikson> agreed

[17:51:15] <river> jk rowling is trending on twitter AGAIN
[18:36:41] <gwozniak> surely it must be for a good reason!

[20:05:58] <kronk> is that lunar logic post advertising.
[20:06:04] <kronk> I feel like it's advertising.
[20:21:14] <gwozniak> It kinda does, but it seems to have a deeper point
[20:21:20] <gwozniak> Still...

[21:48:03] <gerikson> river: someone mentioned that you can use ublock to nuke specific pagee elements so I did that on Twitter.com
[21:48:44] <gwozniak> I don't see ads or recommendations on twitter with uBlock
[21:48:55] <river> oh yes i block a lot of stuff on twitter
[21:49:32] <gwozniak> I never know what's trending
[21:49:39] <river> yeah same
[21:49:43] <river> i hate stuff like taht
[21:50:06] <river> but i was clicking around and noticed this somehow
[22:14:34] <gwozniak> Using AirBnB to donate money to Ukrainians is, like... did you think about this at all?
[22:14:51] <kronk> great PR for AirBnB though.
