[22:03:58] <murthy> let me check
[22:04:09] <Panther> The tank has the ability to engage moving targets while moving over rough terrain.
[22:04:14] <Panther> :)
[22:04:24] <Panther> Which ain't easy
[22:04:35] <murthy> Panther: Its German
[22:04:42] * Panther knows
[22:04:48] <murthy> ok
[22:04:54] <artao> most modern tanks can do that really
[22:04:57] <Panther> Ich habe das schon gesagt :)
[22:05:13] <artao> the germans do build damn fine tanks tho
[22:05:16] <artao> for sure
[22:05:16] <murthy> I didn't understand
[22:05:29] <murthy> that one looked like Dutch
[22:05:41] <artao> but also the rooskies and brits and u.s. and such
[22:05:48] <murthy> ya
[22:05:58] <murthy> German engineering was one of the finest
[22:06:02] <Panther> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLW_remote_weapon_station
[22:06:02] <Janet> ^ FLW stands for "remotely operated, light weapon station" developed by the German defence company Krauss-Maffei Wegmann brands its family of remote weapon stations.
[22:06:04] <artao> tanks be crazy
[22:06:17] <Panther> It is, but that can be a drawback... 
[22:06:45] <artao> wire-guiding munitions
[22:06:48] <Panther> overengineering things makes them difficult to produce and maintain.

[22:35:36] <sublim20> to get these text messages that i missed
[22:35:52] <sublim20> the joys of having a peasant phone plan, and watching youtube without wifi
[22:35:52] <nativetexan> you don't have unlimited text?
[22:36:04] <sublim20> nah, i just blew the data
[22:36:11] <nativetexan> oh ok
[22:36:25] <sublim20> can't complain
[22:36:29] <nativetexan> yeah, i have a data limit, but unlimited text and calls
[22:36:29] <sublim20> shits less than 15 bucks
[22:36:34] <nativetexan> wow
[22:36:40] <morlog> i have no data limit
[22:36:42] <morf> :|
[22:37:01] <sublim20> the datas fine, or enough for general usage, in terms of receiving text messages, and using google maps
[22:37:08] <nativetexan> my phone is rolled into my at&t bill

[22:37:29] <morlog> i can watch badger badger badger all day at a full 4k
[22:37:35] <sublim20> i used to have metropcs
[22:37:37] <murthy> morlog: not even fup?
[22:37:54] <sublim20> and that shit was fine, till they switched over to the tmobile network
[22:37:56] <sublim20> which was shit
[22:37:58] <morlog> im on t-mobile, had metropcs before
[22:38:09] <sublim20> isn't tmobile with at&t now
[22:38:15] <murthy> t-mobile has no fup?
[22:38:25] <morlog> tnobiles service is a lot better than metropcs
[22:38:36] <sublim20> i dont know what metropcs is
[22:38:39] <morlog> no, tmobile bought up sprint
[22:38:47] <nativetexan> i have standard cable tv, home phone, unlimited 100MB internet, and my cell phone rolled into one bill around $250.mo
[22:38:49] <sublim20> well, now a days, metropcs used to piggy back off verizon
[22:38:53] <nativetexan> $250/mo
[22:38:54] <murthy> here 100 sms per day
[22:39:02] <murthy> I want to abolish sms
[22:39:04] <sublim20> then they swtiched to tmobile,and it was shit show
[22:39:07] <morlog> metropcs is to tmobile like cricket is to at&t
[22:39:13] <murthy> also marketing emails
[22:39:14] <sublim20> damn son

[22:39:35] <morlog> metropcs piggy backs off of tmobile, verizon is its main compoetitor

[22:40:29] <nativetexan> well, i need a decent cell phone network because my home inspection software uses the internet so budget cell phone plans don't go the outter edges of houston
