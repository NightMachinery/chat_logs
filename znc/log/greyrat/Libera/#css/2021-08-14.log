[00:04:00] <jokoon> can I ask a question on adding filter rules with ublock for elements?
[00:05:10] <jokoon> some website add a overflow:hidden on body
[00:05:19] <jokoon> when there's a cookie popup
[00:14:03] <hassoon> what i this supposed to mean ?
[00:14:06] <hassoon> do you need css help ?

[00:22:58] <matsaman> jokoon: yeah those are annoying popups for people who don't store cookies

[00:23:36] <jokoon> hassoon, try blocking an element with ublock
[00:24:00] <jokoon> on some websites, they add an overflow:hidden on body

[00:43:42] <DPA> Some websites also do some "position:fixed;" bs as an additional anti-scroll measure. So that would also need to be overwritten to static / initial.

[01:21:32] <deepy> if you feel that ublock origin isn't spiteful enough towards advertisements there's https://adnauseam.io/ which is basically ublock origin + spite
[01:26:45] <matsaman> cute
[01:26:50] *** Quits: lalitmee (~lalitmee@180.94.33.244) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[01:27:04] <matsaman> sometimes I wonder about ad blockers, though
[01:27:10] <matsaman> the only real issue is programmatic ads, right?
[01:27:20] <matsaman> and how many really popular programmatic ad networks even are there
[01:27:40] <matsaman> Google's network essentially relies on a single easily-blockable script
[01:28:05] <deepy> I think most people agree that the problem isn't necessarily the ads themselves but rather how invasive the tracking is
[01:29:57] <matsaman> mmm, I don't know about
[01:30:07] <deepy> like sure I want to support sites, but I don't think supporting <random recipe website> is best done by having google and facebook get all information they can about me and then try to sell me whatever they think is most relevant
[01:30:13] <matsaman> the tracking is lame & stupid, but a lot of sites are doing that on their own, separately from their ad scripts, anyway
[01:30:42] <deepy> oh but the big concern isn't the websites themselves tracking you, it's that google/facebook/etc has to know everything about you to be able to serve the best ads
[01:30:49] <matsaman> yeah, they should be choosing ads based on the content you're looking at
[01:30:59] <matsaman> not content you may have looked at before
[01:31:10] <matsaman> people resent that shit, and I don't blame them
[01:31:18] <matsaman> it's also completely out of touch with traditional advertising
[01:31:23] <deepy> and since everyone has the "like on facebook" or google ads or google's website statistics literally everything about you gets sent to a central server to be put into your profile

[01:32:20] <matsaman> realistically disabling JS does all you would want to stop ads you don't want
[01:32:34] <matsaman> and as a bonus it makes most pages writ by 12-year-old clowns not work at all =P
[01:32:39] <matsaman> but me? I just close the tab
[01:32:58] <deepy> disabling JS also makes my bank website stop working
[01:33:13] <matsaman> that's 'cause your bank website is a pile of shit =)
[01:33:16] <matsaman> but all of them are
[01:33:19] <matsaman> so that's just tough, heh
[01:33:29] <matsaman> a whitelist of sites to allow JS to be enabled on would probably be smart
[01:33:33] <deepy> for once I don't actually agree with you, my bank has rather good JS for once
[01:33:44] <deepy> it's not a SPA and just enhances the functionality
[01:34:09] <matsaman> you just said it doesn't work without JS, so no it doesn't "just enhance"
[01:34:28] <matsaman> what it does is offload processing power to end users, selfishly
[01:34:35] <matsaman> and in the name of fad JS frameworks
[01:35:23] <deepy> if my bank's website feels better to use and becomes more responsive at the cost of taxing my ryzen 7 5800X I am more than comfortable with that
[01:35:40] <deepy> because my insurance company's website doesn't do that and I spend a while waiting for things to load on their page
[01:36:57] <matsaman> yeah, frontends and backends can both suck =P
[01:37:36] <deepy> ideally JS just enhances the UI so that if you turn it off things still work
[01:37:58] <deepy> but I'm perfectly ok with light JS as long as my browser continues to behave
[01:38:14] <deepy> if you mess with the scrolling I'm going to mail you the next roadkill I find
[01:38:52] <deepy> if you add smooth scrolling through JS to your website I'm going to stuff it with ants as well
[01:44:45] <matsaman> I agree, although I still perfer not requiring JS for things that aren't particularly dynamic

[23:14:49] <hassoon> depending on screen size

[23:16:06] <hassoon> they are two h1's
[23:16:10] <hassoon> what's bad about that
[23:16:48] <hassoon> FightingFalcon: you can also use a pseudo-element in .frontleft, and hide .frontright h1 when needed

[23:17:09] <FightingFalcon> but how come z-index doesnt work
[23:17:26] <hassoon> whose z-index ?
[23:19:21] <hassoon> ah, it's because you used clip-path
[23:19:24] <FightingFalcon> z-index of divs and h1
[23:19:25] <hassoon> use a background instead
[23:19:39] <FightingFalcon> clip-path prevents z-index?
[23:21:01] <hassoon> i never used it, i'd just use a background image that looks exactly the same as your inclined background, without using clip-path, but obviously it's messing up the z-index
[23:22:19] <FightingFalcon> OK
