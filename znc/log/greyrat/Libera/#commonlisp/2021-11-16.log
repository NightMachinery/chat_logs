[07:49:27] <Lycurgus> you could just setup a FRED server for a single tld like .lisp

[11:21:40] <jackdaniel> phantomics: re acos, the spec only says, that acos may give complex number of a real argument, it doesn't specify which quadrant for the imaginary part it should return
[11:22:30] <jackdaniel> under the hood ecl inlines   (i.e for a double float argument where the result will be complex) cacos(#0 + I*0.0)
[11:23:18] <jackdaniel> however when it is build without complex floats it returns a complex with the opposite imaginary part
[11:23:26] <jackdaniel> hmm, suspicious :)
[11:23:40] <phantomics> Ok, Bike was saying the branch cuts are explicit in the spec
[11:23:53] <phantomics> That's odd
[11:24:39] <phantomics> I guess I can specify an alternate acos implementation in the case of ECL, the other CLs and common APL implementations all have a matching acos
[11:24:42] <jackdaniel> I'd like to see the entry in the spec that applies to acos and asin - spec is indeed explicit with branch cuts but that applies only to real numbers
[11:24:54] <jackdaniel> s/only/mostly/
[11:25:48] <jackdaniel> either way I'll add an issue entry because a disrapency due to different compilation options is suspicious at best
[11:26:48] <phantomics> Sounds good, it's probably for the best that CLs have consistent trig functions
[11:28:45] <jackdaniel> well, the "soft" version ported from cmucl used when there are no complex floats available is much slower
[11:30:26] <phantomics> It's implemented in CL and not C?

[11:30:51] <jackdaniel> https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/-/issues/661
[11:31:25] <jackdaniel> when complex floats are available (default), then trigonometric functions are inlined using C functions (like cacos)
[11:31:49] *** Quits: gaqwas (~john@dynamic-095-115-127-003.95.115.pool.telefonica.de) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[11:32:10] <jackdaniel> when they are not, then a fallback function is used with a formula (with appropriate declarations) ported from cmucl (and probably shared at least in spirit with sbcl)
[11:32:14] <jackdaniel> (let ((sqrt-1+z (sqrt (+ 1 z)))
[11:32:14] <jackdaniel>              (asinh (imagpart (* (conjugate sqrt-1+z) sqrt-1-z)))))
[11:32:16] <jackdaniel>         (sqrt-1-z (sqrt (- 1 z))))
[11:32:19] <jackdaniel>     (complex (* 2 (atan (realpart sqrt-1-z) (realpart sqrt-1+z)))
[11:32:51] <jackdaniel> the latter conses more and calls at least a few functions (that may be effectively inlined with C counterparts)
[11:33:21] <jackdaniel> either way I won't label it as a bug until proven otherwise, still worth keeping in the tracker
[11:33:30] <phantomics> Likely that's the algo used in sbcl, thanks for looking into it
[11:33:58] <jackdaniel> regarding ecl not being able to compile things - I can't reproduce this issue, so I can't help much
[11:34:17] <phantomics> Ok, could it have anything to do with /tmp folder permissions?
[11:34:18] <jackdaniel> the most likely reason is that you have something weird in your environment (some kind of hardening?)
[11:34:27] <jackdaniel> perhaps
[11:34:38] <rotateq> hm i would write sqrt[1+z] ^^
[11:35:13] <phantomics> I'll see if I can find the factor causing the problem, if so I'll let you know
[11:35:42] <jackdaniel> rotateq: using [] in the source code is risky because user may conformingly use these for their own reader macros
[11:36:33] <rotateq> jackdaniel: yes i thought adding "... as long as no read macro is defined"
[11:37:50] <phantomics> The stack problem I was having seemed to come from low memory in the system, but other CLs could manage, after a restart it didn't happen any longer
[11:39:03] <rotateq> or using Dirac's bra and ket for such things :P
[11:50:08] <jackdaniel> there are two  cleanup issues (not normative) about branch cuts for atan dealing with similar problem

[18:51:59] <_73> I have a function that uses `&rest lsts`. I want to recursively call the function with the `cdr` of all the lists in `lsts`. I finally realized that the bug in my function was that I was making the recursive call with `(mapcar #'cdr lsts)` which returned one list of lists which is not what I want when I am using &rest. It should be more clear in the example what I am trying to do: http://dpaste.com/8L8ES7DUU
[18:53:08] <Bike> (apply #'longerp (cdr lst) (mapcar #'cdr lsts))
[18:54:06] <Bike> you could also do this without consing if you used LENGTH. i don't know if you're doing this as a limited exercise or what though.
[18:54:50] <_73> Bike: If I use `apply` is the function no longer tail recursive?
[18:55:20] *** Joins: Devon (~devon@pool-108-28-172-103.washdc.fios.verizon.net)
[18:55:30] <Bike> it should still be tail recursive. your implementation may or may not optimize it as such, though
[18:55:41] <spiaggia> _73: It still is, but why do you care?
[18:56:01] <NotThatRPG_> Agreed: this is going to be quite inefficient, I think.  You could do it in one loop through the list, retaining the current longest. Isn't your function going to be O(n^2) instead of O(n)?
[18:56:03] <Bike> but you're doing quite a lot of heap consing each iteration anyway, so i wouldn't worry too much about tail recursion
[18:56:25] <_73> Ok I understand. Thanks
[18:56:55] <spiaggia> _73: Also, why do you use names like LST and LSTS rather than LIST and LISTS?
[18:57:02] *** NotThatRPG_ is now known as NotThatRPG
[18:57:59] <_73> spiaggia: the author of `on lisp` used `lst`. I furthered the convention to `lsts` cause it made sense to me and adheres to conventions in other languages I have uses.
[18:58:12] <spiaggia> _73: And your docstring is misleading.  It could mean that LST should be longer than the sum of the length of the others.
[18:58:39] <spiaggia> _73: The author of "On Lisp" is known not to follow good conventions.
[18:59:39] <spiaggia> And I agree with Bike, you should probably use LENGTH instead.
[19:00:01] <NotThatRPG> (loop :for l :in (rest lists) :as len = (length l)  :with maxl = (length (first l)) :with longest = (first l) :when (> len maxl) :do (setf maxl len longest l) :finally (return longest))
[19:00:14] <Bike> to do this without consing while keeping this scheme style of not using any useful operators, you could do something like: (defun longer1p (list1 list2) (cond ((null list1) nil) ((null list2) t) (t (longer1p (cdr list1) (cdr list2))))) (defun longerp (list &rest lists) (if (null lists) t (and (longer1p list (first lists)) (apply #'longerp list
[19:00:14] <Bike> (rest lists)))))
[19:00:31] <yitzi> _73: Using lst is only needed lisp-1 languages.
[19:01:14] *** Joins: VincentVega (~user@212.241.28.158)
[19:02:45] <Bike> scheme exercise, i should say. scheme itself is fine
[19:03:47] <_death> I think the point is not to use length, as traversing the whole list may not be needed
[19:04:00] <spiaggia> _73: I would have the docstring read "Return true if and only if the length LIST is greater than the length of each of the lists in LISTS"
[19:04:25] <spiaggia> _death: Ah, good point.
[19:05:21] *** Joins: ym (~ym@5.143.220.3)
[19:07:04] <_death> another small style suggestion is substitute TEST for (if TEST t nil)
[19:08:21] <_73> _death: I am not sure what you mean by this. Do you mean to make a variable TEST?
[19:08:57] <spiaggia> _73: He means that anything of the form (if <something> t nil) can be replaced by <something>.
[19:09:42] <_73> ahh yes that is nicer
[19:12:48] <_death> also, if you have a predicate, often you can avoid IF and just use OR/AND.. like (or (and (some ...) (and (notnull ...) ...)) (longerp ...))
[19:13:43] <_death> and then, if you have say (and a (and b c)) you just use (and a b c)
[19:16:49] <_death> (but in your case, the SOME test is not needed anyway)

[19:22:08] <_death> (and (not (null lst)) (or (every #'null lsts) (longerp (cdr lst) (mapcar #'cdr lsts))))
[19:22:25] <_death> though as others pointed out, consing also has its price
[19:22:41] <_death> (and there should be apply there)
[19:25:34] <_death> it may be that some prefer (if (null lst) nil ...) so the if->and/or transformation is not an absolute rule
[19:26:59] <spiaggia> I can't imagine who that would be.
[19:27:15] <_73> _death: Thanks I wrote it out the way you suggested. While I can't say that I find the function more clear this way it is useful to realize that I can replace if statements with `or/and` sequences.
[19:27:19] * spiaggia forgot :)
[19:28:59] <_death> I guess it depends on how long you spent reading logic formulas
