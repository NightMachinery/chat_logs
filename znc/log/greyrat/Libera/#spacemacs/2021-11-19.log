[00:49:42] <Codaraxis> I've entered a weird Evil normal mode state where <d> and <j> act as if Caps Lock is on, but it's not
[00:49:49] <Codaraxis> This isn't the first time it's happened and in the past I've fixed it by restarting Emacs, but I'd like to know how I caused this and undo it without closing everything open
[00:54:44] <Codaraxis> Actually... I described the problem completely incorrectly... <d> is acting as <dd>. <c> is acting as <cc>. <j> and the other movement keys are unaffected
[00:55:14] <Codaraxis> <S-d> and <S-c> still work as they should
[01:22:17] <Codaraxis> Looks like it's an Evil-mode bug: https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/issues/571
