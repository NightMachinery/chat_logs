[14:18:18] <arryana> i find all of that incredibly impressive
[14:20:17] <arryana> i admit, i wish i had a hundredth of your talent
[14:21:05] <Lumine> I'm still going off side to side with my style since I'm still searching for it. I'm trying to get a new set of skills which is anatomy. It's a big, big course. So it will take a while. In the mean time I'm making landscapes which some kind of gist.

[14:33:41] <amigojapan> Lumine: my wife has a deviant art. She is not as good as you, but she likes to imitate anime drawings https://www.deviantart.com/amigajapan/gallery
[14:33:42] <ro-bot-o> [url] amigajapan User Profile | DeviantArt | www.deviantart.com
[14:34:26] <amigojapan> Art least she did that a few years ago
[14:38:35] <Lumine> I don't consider myself as better or worse than anyone when it comes to creativity, everyone has their strengths, even if dormant ones. Technical skill can be objectified up to a point and we actually debated on this in lengths with my best friend once, on technical ability and creativity. What's the difference between a highly skilled artist, and an amateur? Is the difference always rooted in the hours they put in their craft? Their
[14:38:35] <Lumine> passion? It was fascinating
[14:41:45] <amigojapan> Lumine: I know some people that don't think they have any talent when they do. And one person with the opposite problem. Not that they did not have talent, but they thought they were the best
[14:43:28] <Lumine> Well I would consider myself somewhere in between. Acknowledging that I have some skill, yet playing it cool. Because the moment I assume I'm "better" than someone, I've let myself in for hubris.
[14:44:47] <amigojapan> Lumine: that sounds like a good position to be in
[14:45:26] <amigojapan> Lumine: have you heard of NFTs? I don't really know if they are a good idea
[14:45:45] <Lumine> I have, and artists are getting ripped off currently in waves because of NFT criminals
[14:46:01] <amigojapan> Oh yes?
[14:46:15] <amigojapan> Howcome?
[14:46:36] <amigojapan> Of criminals i see
[14:46:40] <Lumine> I'm following three well-known artists who said they are battling with them constantly, of making DCMA requests to take off their artwork from Opensea and other places
[14:47:05] <amigojapan> Ouch
[14:47:59] <Lumine> I have no interest in taking part in that crypto shitshow
[14:49:06] <Lumine> If people want to steal my art, which they have in the past, I'll consider it an honor, I have no energy to start fighting over them every day
[14:50:00] <Lumine> One solution is of course to turn to traditional drawings and paintings, which almost completely negates thefts
[14:50:05] <amigojapan> I see Lumine
[14:50:23] <amigojapan> True
[14:51:03] <arryana> i think it's fair enough to allow yourself to be better at something than someone else.  people have all sorts of aptitudes and levels of them.
[14:51:51] <kmh> today's random tv quote: "Nothing says republican like tobacco, golf and cheap labour!"
[14:53:22] <Lumine> arryana: yeah it's fine if you keep it to yourself and don't go around advertising how great you are, I mean it's one thing to know that you're better than someone else, and another thing to hammer it in at every chance you get
[14:53:56] <arryana> other people can always be counted on to tell you you're great if you are.  i'm still a fan of enthusiasm, though

[15:00:45] <arryana> there's no wholesale candle supply place?
[15:01:20] <pussipupu> possibly by I suck at searching in Finnish

[15:08:09] <Lumine> Yes
[15:08:13] <Lumine> I did
[15:11:19] <pussipupu> working for a year has really improved my Finnish
[15:11:24] <Lumine> Are you looking at making your own candles then pussipupu?
[15:11:56] <pussipupu> yeah, I used to and I'd like to start again, and this time maybe 3d print molds
[15:13:11] <Lumine> You need kynttilämassa
[15:13:22] <Lumine> Which is a ready made mix of candle ingredients
[15:13:38] <Lumine> Or parafiini or steariini
[15:13:48] <arryana> oooh
[15:13:54] <pussipupu> paraffin wax mixed with steerin?
[15:13:56] <arryana> i'd like to see some of that when you're done, if you don't mind
[15:14:02] <pussipupu> ah, clearly yes
[15:14:13] <pussipupu> sure, if there's anything to show
[15:14:35] <Lumine> Yes pussipupu, they're mixed in perfect ratio in the massa
[15:14:52] <pussipupu> I can find all the things I need, but from three shops is all
[15:15:02] <pussipupu> I prefer to mix my own, so I can control the hardness

[21:59:37] <biys> so i work in the HVAC industry...  and there's new technology that's being implemented to promote comfort in businesses
[22:00:01] <biys> for example, just one example, they're introducing thermal imaging to determine peoples temperatures so the ssytem can adjust to promote comfort for as many people as possible
[22:00:04] <biys> automatically
[22:00:36] <biys> another example is cameras with machine learning that will watch for people to exhibit signs of sickness (coughing for example)
[22:00:54] <biys> and it will adjust the HVAC in order to prevent the spread, and notify the appropriate people to have the person removed from the building
[22:01:42] <biys> this is all being done under the guise of uh...
[22:01:47] <biys> productivity
[22:02:03] <biys> cause we all know that the happier/more care free a person is the more productive they are
