[02:15:40] <CarloWood> I can hardly imagine that typeid(*this) does a lot of work - I think this is literally like comparing two hard coded values (at runtime)
[02:16:02] <rajkosto> it requires RTTI on just like dynamic_cast

[02:18:30] <rajkosto> there is nothing wrong with using typeid for things like printing out some class name or something in a debug routine, not to actually implement the inheritance structure
[02:18:40] <CarloWood> It doesn't really matter how you traverse an array when in the end you fill all members with data ￼
[02:18:40] <CarloWood> [6:52 PM]
[02:18:40] <CarloWood> I start at the end because this is an imgui histogram with most recent FPS values. The last value in the array corresponds with the bar on the far-right, which is thus the most recent value.  So, filling it from most-recent to whatever is the latest value that was stored goes from right to left, or the end of the array towards the beginning.

[03:05:21] <ivan_wagner> I'm doing multiplication of word[i] by "recursive" multiplication of 10 depending where the [i] is located
[03:06:05] <RandomReader> usually it's easier to go backwards, starting with value 0 and then (multiple by 10, add new digit) repeatedly
[03:06:42] <RandomReader> for the approach you're going for, I think the count is still "backwards" for your recursive multiplication
[03:06:43] <Alipha> ivan_wagner: maybe it would help to display shift inside your for loop (or use a debugger to look at shift's value as you loop)
[03:08:07] <RandomReader> or maybe I should say "distance" or "position" instead of "count", if that makes more sense
[03:08:34] <ivan_wagner> RandomReader, at first I started that way, then I came up with idea it might be easier to save ones first and then add the rest from. Will try to rewrite that one again maybe it will freshen my train of thoughts
[03:09:00] <RandomReader> I would start with Alipha's suggestion first, just to better understand what you have now
[03:09:35] <ivan_wagner> well I mean there is an output, you can run the program so it shows where I am at
[03:10:45] <RandomReader> the suggestion is for you to observe each step of the calculation, on the way to the output
[03:13:40] <ivan_wagner> will do and what would you suggest for detection of uint32 overflow?

[03:17:22] <RandomReader> that will depend on what approach you ultimately end up with .. in general, you need to determine if the next operation will exceed the limit
[03:18:02] <RandomReader> so that may involve counting digits, checking (max - current) <= next_value, or that sort of thing
[03:18:34] <Alipha> ivan_wagner: Your previous thought of doing the calculation using uint64_t variables and then checking to see if the uint64_t value is larger than can be stored in a uint32_t is a good and simple approach. There was probably just an issue with your implementation. Most likely, you didn't make all the variables which needed to be uint64_t, but instead left some of them as, say, int.
[03:18:56] <Alipha> (wonders if his hinting is obvious enough) ;-)
[03:19:26] <RandomReader> as Alipha notes, using uint64_t to hold your calculation and checking against uint32_t max at each step would work in this specific case, just be aware that technique doesn't scale (since e.g. there is no uint128_t for future use)
[03:19:58] <Alipha> ivan_wagner: though you are also correct in wanting to get your algorithm correct first, and then after that, tackle the problem of detecting overflow
[03:20:31] <ivan_wagner> I rewrote whole function to use uint64_t and changed result to uint64_t at the very end on function I compared it in single if statement

[03:22:09] <ivan_wagner> RandomReader, well, you are actually right about that one
[03:22:55] <cbreak> there were some people at microsoft that thought it to be a good idea to parse a version number as integer. It was not.
[03:23:38] <cbreak> Since microsoft version numbers can get very long, it lead to an integer overflow on parsing, which then lead to e-mail servers crashing (I think... or anti-virus scanning on the server? not sure)
[03:23:51] <cbreak> so... parsing numbers is hard. Dealing with overflows is hard.
[03:24:03] <cbreak> but should be done :)
[03:24:04] <RandomReader> compared to many assembly platforms, C++ doesn't provide for overflow flags on operations, instead it just broadly defines the types as either "overflow undefined" (for signed types) or "overflow wraps as if modulo" (the unsigned types you're working with)
[03:25:02] <RandomReader> that also does allow for another potential technique here: if you are mathematically certain about the range of the next operation, checking whether the new result is less than the old result can indicate it wrapped (overflowed)

[03:25:58] <Alipha> ivan_wagner: RandomReader's point was that you should check that the uint64_t value is larger than uint32_t's max as you perform the calculation and not to wait until the very end to check

[03:28:41] <dale> Hi!  Given int16_t n = -2, n & 0x7fff seems to be 32766.  I expected this result, but reading a copy of the C++17 draft spec, the section on the bitwise and operator (section 8.11 in my copy) doesn't seem to address the sign bit or negative numbers at all.  Contrast with, say, the bitwise shift operators, which specifically address negative numbers.  Is there a part of the spec that says "the sign bit
[03:28:43] <dale> is treated like any other bit when doing bitwise and/or", or is that just implicit?
[03:31:28] <Alipha> dale: prior to c++20, it was implementation defined as to how negative numbers are represented. With c++20, signed integers now must be represented using Two's Complement

[03:35:29] <dale> I think I'm just getting hung up on the fact that the spec for the shift operators explicitly addresses the sign bit (well, negative numbers), but bitwise and/or do not.  Upon further reflection I'm having trouble imagining any sane way for and/or to behave other than how I observe them to work in practice.
[03:35:58] <dale> Saying something like "the sign bit from the left operand is (uh) preserved in the result" is not sane, I think.

[03:41:32] <cbreak> ivan_wagner_ml: extract?
[03:41:35] <RandomReader> that meant native shift operations would do different things whether they were arithmetic or bitwise, and may fill or trap or do other interesting things
[03:43:12] <RandomReader> so C++ defined shift relative to the specified non-negative representation it displays everywhere else, but left it implementation-defined for negative values
[03:43:49] <RandomReader> and then just left bit-and/or/etc as working on the representation, whatever that may be
[03:44:28] <Alipha> iirc, the standard (prior to c++20) well-defined shifting positive integers and left-shifting negative integers (unless they underflowed), but kept it implementation-defined for right shift? Or was left shift of negative numbers implementation defined too?
[03:45:15] <RandomReader> C++11: https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n3337/expr.shift#2
[03:45:39] <dale> Indeed in C++20 it looks like left/right shift on negative numbers is no longer undefined/implementation-defined.
[03:45:50] <RandomReader> vs today: http://eel.is/c++draft/expr.shift
[03:46:28] <RandomReader> looks like bit-and is just better specified, https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n3337/expr.bit.and  vs  http://eel.is/c++draft/expr.bit.and
[03:47:49] <RandomReader> actually I got it wrong for shift, left-shift of negative used to be *undefined*, rather than implementation-defined
[03:48:31] <RandomReader> I think there were platforms where that trapped, so maybe that wasn't considered a reasonable outcome for IB
[03:48:35] <dale> I think my take-away is that everyone accepts that *all* bits in the operands are and have always been affected uniformly when doing bitwise and/or on signed numbers.
