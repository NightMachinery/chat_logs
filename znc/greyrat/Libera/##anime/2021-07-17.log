[09:41:21] <ButterNoodle> no one shows up here bc its irc
[09:41:22] <Sadale> I'm not so sure about that
[09:42:02] <ButterNoodle>  and irc is sexist
[09:42:07] <Sadale> lol
[09:42:20] <ButterNoodle> probably racist
[09:43:14] <Sadale> So is discord
[09:43:14] <Sadale> I think the problem of IRC is that normal people wouldn't be able to discover it. And most of them who ended up being on IRC are those nerds, which are mostly male.
[09:44:07] <ButterNoodle> is discord racist?
[09:44:16] <ButterNoodle> there are a shit tonne of all girl discords
[09:44:24] <amigojapan> I finally understood why osamu tezuka did not sue Disney for the lion king

[09:44:42] <ButterNoodle> gay also
[09:44:55] <amigojapan> He died in 1989. The lion king was made in 1994
[09:44:57] <ButterNoodle> my jerk squad invaded a few
[09:44:58] <Sadale> I have no problem with trans per se. But some of them are just oversensitive like accusing others being transphobia without any ground.
[09:45:25] <ButterNoodle> its fun
[09:46:02] <ButterNoodle> one of the girls in my discord was pretending to be another girl
[09:46:35] <ButterNoodle> had a fb and everything.. she was trolling guys and girls in these freaky discords
[09:46:44] <ButterNoodle> nickelson was there

[09:46:50] <ImoutoBot_> ButterNoodle: nickelson was last seen in #anime 2 years and 11 months ago: <Nickelson> What tea are you having today, beaky
[09:46:52] <Sadale> I don't like discord that there're far too many kids on it.
[09:47:10] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I had a friend when I was a teenager that would come to my house to IRC pretending to be a guy
[09:47:27] <Sadale> And I don't like that it's proprietary

[09:48:10] <ButterNoodle> sure you can do a lot of things without water.. but sometime or other you will use it

[09:48:29] <ButterNoodle> yea
[09:48:34] <ButterNoodle> discord is a shit app
[09:48:37] <Sadale> That's one more thing that I don't likke about whatever tools that get popular.

[10:14:04] *** Joins: treeman5 (~treeman5@user/treeman5)
[10:14:14] <DunceCotus> amigojapan I'm pretty sure my graves/thyroid issue is due to aspartame
[10:14:22] <DunceCotus> or that's one major aspect
[10:14:57] <DunceCotus> amigojapan also 2 litres of water is quite a lot
[10:15:11] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: better than taking sugar tho
[10:15:18] <DunceCotus> amigojapan arguable
[10:15:45] <DunceCotus> amigojapan better for preventing weight gain I guess
[10:15:53] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: definitely for tomako and her diabetes
[10:15:54] <DunceCotus> but there's bad byproducts of metabolising aspartame
[10:16:00] <DunceCotus> which can accumulate in body and cause massive issues
[10:16:27] <DunceCotus> amigojapan I see
[10:16:43] <DunceCotus> amigojapan you could try to find a drink sweetened with stevia or someething
[10:16:45] <DunceCotus> that's safer I think
[10:17:17] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I think current cola zero uses sucralose
[10:20:01] <DunceCotus> "We sweeten Coke Zero Sugar in our bottles and cans with a blend of aspartame and acesulfame potassium (or Ace-K). Together, they create a great taste with zero sugar and zero calories. Yes. Diet Coke in our bottles and cans is sweetened with aspartame." - Coca-Cola
[10:20:40] <DunceCotus> not sure about Japanese Cozero/Codiet
[10:20:59] <DunceCotus> but that's from the horse's mouth
[10:21:53] <amigojapan> Well I will check the label
[10:22:06] <amigojapan> Give me a minute
[10:22:15] <DunceCotus> Ok sir
[10:23:01] <amigojapan> I am sure I have seen sucralose in some diet drink in Japan
[10:24:34] <DunceCotus> aspartame may not cause cancer but its byproducts could make it more likely, along with other issues like thyroid disorders
[10:28:45] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: yeah. It's written in katakana. But Japanese coke zero uses sucralose
[10:29:05] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: the label says so
[10:29:10] <Cryowolf> I wish they hadn't stopped selling Cola Stevia here in bigger grocery stores
[10:29:13] <DunceCotus> YEAH WELL
[10:29:34] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf yeah what's with that
[10:29:49] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it also tastes much better since they changed to sucralose
[10:30:06] <S_T_A_N> Diet Coke is the greatest beverage that has ever evered 
[10:30:37] <Cryowolf> I really liked it, tasted almost like regular (without the lingering aftertaste of too sweet sugar)
[10:31:10] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: is Stevia sucralose?
[10:31:14] <Cryowolf> no
[10:31:17] <amigojapan> Oh
[10:31:32] <Cryowolf> Stevia is a leaf
[10:31:33] <DunceCotus> S_T_A_N wat. Diet Coke is awful
[10:31:34] <S_T_A_N> Regular Coke, and the attempts to make a diet soda that actually taste like it, are the worst beverage that has ever evered 
[10:31:35] <Cryowolf> a plant
[10:32:00] <amigojapan> I see
[10:32:14] <S_T_A_N> Diet Coke is what happens when you try making a good diet soda rather than try to make a diet version of something that can never be diet
[10:32:19] <Cryowolf> and just like wwith sugar, it can be refined
[10:32:40] <Cryowolf> but it's like 1000 times or more sweeter than sugar, so you need 1000 / less
[10:32:50] <Cryowolf> meaning lower calorie
[10:33:02] <amigojapan> I see
[10:33:48] <Cryowolf> unlike other sweetening chemicals though, stevia can be metabolized by the body
[10:33:54] <DunceCotus> S_T_A_N Coke No Sugar > Diet Coke
[10:33:56] <DunceCotus> imo
[10:33:56] <amigojapan> Seems there are anti sucralose folk out there too
[10:33:58] <Cryowolf> so it doesn't just pass through
[10:34:30] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf what are the metabolic byproducts of stevia though?
[10:34:38] <Cryowolf> I don't know
[10:34:48] <Cryowolf> it's a carbohydrate
[10:34:50] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: in Japan there is a cola product that has no sugar, it is also not sweet
[10:35:12] <Cryowolf> I don't mind aspartame though
[10:35:19] <Cryowolf> I'm not a fan of the taste of sucralose

[10:36:56] <Cryowolf> comparing cola zero with cola light, I prefer zero
[10:37:00] <Cryowolf> but they changed the recipe
[10:37:04] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I guess it is pretty suspicious that they are using different sweeteners in different countries
[10:37:07] <Cryowolf> and I like it less now
[10:37:52] <Cryowolf> they use every sweetener in Sweden (I think)
[10:38:00] <Cryowolf> Sucralose was being investigated for awhile
[10:38:15] <Cryowolf> but was then deemed safe at the levels that were in a bottle

[10:41:25] <DunceCotus> amigojapan yeah they re-branded after the Mandela Effects
[10:41:43] <DunceCotus> Coke Zero changed (inexplicably) to Coca-Cola Zero

[10:48:12] <Cryowolf> then they stopped
[10:48:25] <Cryowolf> or well weren't allowed to use it in Sweden anymore anyway
[10:48:25] <amigojapan> I see
[10:48:25] <DunceCotus> amigojapan in 2015 Coca-Cola released a statement here (australia) saying they're moving away from use of aspartame toward stevia
[10:48:33] <DunceCotus> its now 2021 and they still use aspartame in their drinks
[10:49:06] <Bco1981> stevia makes anything taste bad
[10:49:21] <Cryowolf> I dont mind the taste of Stevia
[10:49:23] <Cryowolf> I use it in my tea
[10:49:25] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: maybe Stevia is expensive or does not produce desired taste
[10:49:36] <Cryowolf> it's a stevia that's been refined and bound to fiber
[10:51:09] <DunceCotus> amigojapan right
[10:51:15] <DunceCotus> it would change the taste quite a bit
[10:52:18] <Cryowolf> it would change the taste a little but they need to use the right ratio and work on the recipe
[10:52:27] <amigojapan> Bco1981: I could record the first episode of the podcast now with you if you wanted...
[10:52:41] <S_T_A_N> amigojapan, Good. Hastening death is good
[10:52:50] <Cryowolf> If they could make cola zero (before the recipe change) taste a lot like regular cola (without the sugar byproduct taste)
[10:52:55] <Cryowolf> then they can do it with stevia
[10:53:40] <S_T_A_N> Zero is gross. 
[10:53:48] <amigojapan> S_T_A_N: at the peace we are going we will never record the podcast
[10:54:08] <S_T_A_N> :(
[10:55:42] <amigojapan> S_T_A_N: I am thinking that me and whomever happens to be on at the moment may be a better recipe
[10:55:56] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf the question is why they havene't
[10:56:03] <DunceCotus> even though they said they will
[10:56:17] <DunceCotus> maybe stevia is more expensive or sommin
[10:56:29] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: they can lie
[10:56:30] <Cryowolf> Maybe because Stevia grows in subtropical countries
[10:56:37] <Cryowolf> and tropical somewhat
[10:56:48] <Cryowolf> and those countries control the supply
[10:57:27] <Cryowolf> most of it in south america, china and vietnam

[11:24:57] <Cryowolf> they get red flush when they drink alcohol
[11:25:01] <amigojapan> I don't know
[11:25:04] <Cryowolf> it is

[11:25:19] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I mean in the skin. Not drinking
[11:25:19] <Cryowolf> maybe not
[11:25:43] <Cryowolf> asians get a red flush on their face and some parts of their skin when drinking alcohol
[11:25:51] <Bco1981> i do too
[11:25:54] <Cryowolf> it doesn't itch, scale, shed or anything thjhough
[11:26:06] <Bco1981> it's because you get hawt

[12:50:53] <il> I can type that as well, I just don't know how fast, let's test it lol
[12:51:37] <il> 159wpm
[12:51:44] <amigojapan> Nice
[12:51:52] <amigojapan> Practice that one
[12:51:55] <il> 160wpm
[12:52:01] <il> Why would I practice it? lol
[12:52:32] <amigojapan> Cause it would help you become a better typist
[12:54:19] <il> Not really, it'd make me better at typing that sequence of letters heh
[12:54:46] <DaPinkOne> it's not a bad plan if you're practicing the locations of keys on a new layout
[12:54:57] <amigojapan> Or just type the alphabet, but that is now boring
[12:55:18] <amigojapan> More boring
[12:55:33] <DaPinkOne> at 160wpm though, you're faster than most people, and you're never gonna need to go faster.
[12:56:15] <amigojapan> People that type too fast on IRC are hard to keep up with
[12:56:29] <DaPinkOne> well, I guess if you were trying to be a court stenographer or something, but stenography is a different beast
[12:56:53] <amigojapan> True
[12:58:42] <il> I'm actually not a very fast typist, I rarely get more than 125wpm on 1 minute tests
[12:58:45] <il> But I can burst relatively fast
[12:58:57] <il> So, yeah, I can end up typing specific sentences at 180wpm or whatever
[12:59:27] <DaPinkOne> I come in at around 60wpm, and it's been enough
[13:00:08] <il> You're obviously not a shitposter
[13:00:35] <DaPinkOne> eh, the highest demand i've had is from heated debates in IRC, or taking word-for-word notes in lecture
[13:01:00] <DaPinkOne> profs can get to talking kindof fast, so I end up developing abbreviations for relevant subjects
[13:01:39] <DaPinkOne> writing's much easier for symbols and shorthand than typing is though
[13:02:13] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: my problem for me on irc in heated debates with many users is that I can't read super fast. So at some point I end up ignoring some posts
[13:02:22] <il> I don't understand why people type notes in class... Isn't it easier to just record the lecture?
[13:02:45] <DaPinkOne> il, depending on your state, that may not be legal due to privacy concerns
[13:02:49] <amigojapan> il: why even have a live class?
[13:03:21] <il> amigojapan, that's not what I'm not understanding, I don't understand typing notes verbatim
[13:03:25] <DaPinkOne> there's also issues with weather or not the recording is audible and stuff. you'd need to somehow troubleshoot that beforehand
[13:03:42] <amigojapan> il: people are dumb
[13:03:47] <il> Like, it has been proven that typing notes verbatim is pretty much the least effective way of learning
[13:03:58] <il> might be detrimental, because you have to focus on typing rather than listening to the professor lol
[13:04:01] <DaPinkOne> il, it's the least effective if it's all that you do.
[13:04:13] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: the teacher should provide recordings
[13:04:22] <il> amigojapan, good point
[13:04:28] <revilaika> You are not supposed to write everything either, you should listen and write whatever feels important for you 
[13:04:29] <il> And I'm also a proponent of pen and paper
[13:04:31] <DaPinkOne> amigojapan, again, may not be possible due to technology funding or regulation
[13:04:41] <il> You should be able to note down anything important on paper in a lecture
[13:05:18] <il> revilaika, yep, and when writing by hand, you tend to try to be more concise and write it 'in your own words' which has been proven to help with later recollectoin
[13:05:32] <DaPinkOne> my profs have usually tried to get recordings working, but they're not IT specialists usually, and they may have a hard time with the technology
[13:05:48] <amigojapan> il: there are some teachers that force their students to take notes
[13:06:16] <il> amigojapan, I think that's the right thing to do tbh
[13:06:23] <amigojapan> il: I did not take notes at all in college and got GPA 4.0 :)
[13:07:07] <il> Very impressive
[13:07:14] <amigojapan> il: I rather concentrate on listening
[13:07:25] <amigojapan> Ty
[13:07:50] <amigojapan> Taking notes is distracting to me
[13:08:30] <DaPinkOne> I do my best when I take paper notes or try to work ahead during lectures, then I go over the material after
[13:08:52] <DaPinkOne> it's really time consuming though
[13:09:05] <il> Learning is generally time consuming, I think
[13:09:29] <DaPinkOne> maybe someday we'll be able to jack into the matrix loading room
[13:10:21] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: the leading process can be part of the fun tho
[13:11:13] <DaPinkOne> I really do like it when I work ahead, then the prof ends up getting to the same place. It's a nice feeling of validation. It's easy to get lost in some problems though
[13:11:35] <DaPinkOne> or take dramatically different approaches
[13:11:50] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: I particularly enjoyed learning Japanese. If it would be pumped into my brain. I would have missed a huge joy
[13:12:37] <DaPinkOne> amigojapan, how did you spend most of your time studying? immersion? book study?

[17:51:42] <amigojapan> Bco1981: does anidb show an rating like pg-13 and such or is that only a Mal thing?
[17:52:06] <Bco1981> i don't think so, i can't remember seeing that.
[17:52:12] <Bco1981> only 18+
[17:53:28] <amigojapan> Bco1981: that's not possible keroro gunso is really a kids show
[17:57:08] <Bco1981> then it's not marked 18+
[17:57:22] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[17:58:38] <amigojapan> I guess Mal is the entity that creates the ratings for American people
[18:05:31] <Sadale> Bco1981, oh yes. yours is parallel eyed video. I've hacked it into a cross eyed one. Now it looks better

[20:16:07] <Sadale> Bco1981, how long it took for you to make one of these vid?
[20:16:23] <Sadale> Bco1981, It seems to me that it'd take weeks to make one.
[20:16:53] <Bco1981> that one i re-used a setting/stages i had done for another vid.

[20:17:20] <Bco1981> just setting up the enviroment is an hour or 2.
[20:17:53] <Sadale> Bco1981, ah. How long did that other vid took you then?
[20:17:59] <Bco1981> then adding shading to the model can take half an hour
[20:18:16] <Bco1981> i would say about 4-5 hours
[20:18:24] <Sadale> wow. That's far shorter than I thought
[20:21:03] <theholyduck> i was today years old. when i learned that the french song Les Champs-Élysées is a french cover of a british song called waterloo road
[20:21:06] <theholyduck> wtf..
[20:21:26] <Bco1981> Sadale: it's because the models the stages and the motion and songs are just things you load.
[20:21:40] <Sadale> Bco1981, But how do you make the model dance?'
[20:22:00] <Bco1981> that's a premade motion data file some kind soul shared.
[20:22:01] <Sadale> I thought that you'd have to do the rigging animation manually.
[20:22:02] <dfch> mmd make her dance
[20:22:03] <Sadale> ah.
[20:22:15] <Sadale> So the rigging and motion data are already ready.
[20:22:18] <Bco1981> you can make it manually
[20:22:22] <theholyduck> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r4sBv4m0aI like. i have never heard the english version of this. but apparently its the original

[20:22:25] <Sadale> Makes sense. That's why it takes so little time
[20:22:36] * Sadale learns something new today :3
[20:22:49] <Bco1981> but i want to be able to record motions myself... not that i can dance
[20:23:01] <Sadale> dfch, good good learning; day day pointing upwards :3
[20:23:15] <dfch> good good study, day day up
[20:23:27] <Sadale> lol I like yours more. xD
[20:24:03] <theholyduck> Sadale: i mean  the rigging part is sort of the more important bit of making a model thats supposed to move in some way
[20:24:10] <dfch> google it and you'll know it's original :D
[20:24:16] <dfch> or "classic chinglish"
[20:24:17] <theholyduck> but once you have rigged a skelton its not that hard to apply a set of motions to it
[20:24:26] <Sadale> dfch, I know. I've heard of yours before knowing you actually
[20:24:31] <theholyduck> Sadale: but like this is how you make new models for video games or whatever
[20:24:37] <theholyduck> you make a 3d model. you rig the skeleton for it
[20:24:43] <theholyduck> and apply some movement sets to the skeleton
[20:24:47] <Sadale> theholyduck, I know I know
[20:25:04] <theholyduck> Sadale: why so suprising that theres a dancing set of animations
[20:25:06] <theholyduck> you can use
[20:25:07] <theholyduck> then?
[20:25:21] <Sadale> theholyduck, And I know that it takes long to do that. I was asking why it took so little time for Bco1981 and he told me that he got premade rigging and motion.
[20:25:22] <Bco1981> i think i have some 300 dance motions
[20:25:58] <dfch> Sadale, that's pretty much normal. But speaking of, did you know the most classic chinglish made it mainstream is "long time no see"? :D 
[20:26:04] <Sadale> theholyduck, I just didn't know that there'd be that many preset motions ready for use because I saw so many varied motions in Bco1981's vid.
[20:26:16] <Sadale> dfch, yep.
[20:26:20] <theholyduck> Sadale: :P i mean theres a lot of weebs doing stuff like this 
[20:26:27] <Bco1981> but the motion quality varies a lot
[20:26:30] <Sadale> dfch, This one's very common and now it's actually being used even in western world.
[20:26:34] <dfch> Bco1981, the only one you need is laysha's chocolate cream, prove me wrong :p
[20:26:58] <theholyduck> Sadale:  similarly theres a whole industry of weebs making and rigging porn models and stuff for porn games. 
[20:27:00] <Sadale> I guess the more idiomatic way to say that'd be something like "It's been a while" or similar tho.
[20:27:02] <dfch> Sadale, "The phrase "long time no see" first appeared in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1901. "
[20:27:06] <Sadale> theholyduck, LOL
[20:27:11] <Bco1981> dfch: i found a model today where i can re-use the boots
