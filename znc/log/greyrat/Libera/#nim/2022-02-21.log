[06:10:00] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It's also distinct
[06:10:13] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Not all `(int, int)`s are valid slices
[06:12:07] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Atleast i interpreted it as "Why not use a tuple for slices instead"
[06:12:50] <FromDiscord> <deech> Yes that's what I meant.
[06:13:42] <FromDiscord> <huantian> In reply to @Elegantbeef "an 110 line function": that's a lot of indentation
[06:14:39] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> i'm a bit biased cause i find tuples only useful for return types/unpacking

[06:32:42] <FromDiscord> <deech> Why are they not ordinal?
[06:33:33] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Cause ordinal is a hard coded typeclasss
[06:36:19] <FromDiscord> <deech> I see. Well looking over `system.nim` it looks like the HSlice is constrained by Ordinal, so even if the user had a non ordinal type they wouldn't be able to use any of that. I guess they could overload `[]` and `[]=` etc.
