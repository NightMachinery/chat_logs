[05:21:32] <delarge> hello. I have a dataframe with a datetime.now() column and other column with integers that are seconds. I'm trying to substract the datetime column with the integers. I've tried something like data['date_start_wt']=data['date_stop']-timedelta(seconds=data['integers']) but doesn't work the timedelta for series. So I suppose that I have to define the integers as seconds but doesn't work for me. I've tried 
[05:21:38] <delarge> with pd.to_datetime without success 
[05:22:24] <delarge> I really appreciate any hint
[05:27:29] <rom1504> there are tons of stack overflow on the topic
[05:27:38] <rom1504> they will give good answers
