[00:00:55] <gwozniak> probably old: Docker version 18.06.3-ce, build d7080c1
[00:01:02] <rwb> oop yeah

[00:01:12] <rwb> might be related
[00:01:18] <gwozniak> Running on Ubuntu 14.04, kernel 4.4.0-31-generic
[00:01:26] <rwb> lol bullseye
[00:01:29] <gwozniak> Yeah, I saw that
[00:01:33] <rwb> (not the debian distro with the same name)
[00:01:51] <gwozniak> Well, it would be weird since it just started happening recently
[00:02:06] <rwb> any recent updates? new tests? etc.
[00:02:09] <gwozniak> This stuff hasn't been changed for a while, to my knowledge
[00:02:19] <rwb> well _something_ must've changed
[00:02:25] <gwozniak> I'm fairly certain it is not test related
[00:02:51] <gwozniak> I may have to find out if someone updated something without my knowledge, but this machine is rarely touched
[00:02:57] <rwb> can't say much more without getting hands-on with your test suite
[00:03:04] <gwozniak> It's the GCC test suite
[00:03:21] <rwb> and i'd recommend updating from (what i think is) an unsupported LTS release >.>

[00:03:50] <gwozniak> I have a suspicion that DejaGnu is not killing child processes properly or promptly

[22:32:41] <tarzeau> who in here still remembers ruptime? and would you help contribute ? (run ruptime -u, query with ruptime): https://github.com/alexmyczko/ruptime (data transfer is encrypted, your fqdn is censored except .tld)

[22:35:25] <wink> tarzeau: I think I never heard about it
[22:42:28] <Xe> my lobsters page is always showing that i have one unread message and idk what it is
[22:43:04] <pushcx> Xe: Did you have 1 message and then read it? I added 2 minutes of caching to that number, maybe I missed clearing it somewhere.
[22:43:30] <Xe> not that i know of, i'll wait 2 minutes and look again though
[22:49:37] <Xe> yeah it's gone now pushcx
[22:50:00] <pushcx> cool, good thing caching bugs are always easy to repro and solve :|
[22:50:26] <Xe> ikr :D
[22:53:56] <c355E3B> I though today I would be able to get work done

[22:56:12] <pushcx> it's not ominous when a new caching feature gets a 15-line comment to explain an unusual implementation detail, right?
[22:56:56] <technomancy> it *is* one of the Two Hard Problems
