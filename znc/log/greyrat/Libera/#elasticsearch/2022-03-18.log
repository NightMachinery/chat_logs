[15:41:55] <tasse> Hi, is there any way to have a subaggregation (aka simulate it somehow) on a top-hits aggregation? What I want to do: Getting the sum of the last values by term, e.g. assume
[15:41:56] <tasse> doc1: {organization: A, value: 22}
[15:41:56] <tasse> doc2: {organization: A, value: 12}
[15:41:56] <tasse> doc1: {organization: A, value: 35}
[15:41:56] <tasse> -> I want to have 12 + 35 = 47 as a result (sum of the last values per organization)
[15:42:18] <tasse> i tried with tophits but as this is a metric I cant have a sibling aggregation on this one

[16:05:08] <tasse> got it working with a scripted metric; this was very helpful here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51709347/sum-over-top-hits-aggregation
