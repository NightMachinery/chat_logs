[10:49:58] <Carbonflux> thats one of the things i like about ESO, there are bards everywhere singing various songs.
[10:50:31] <Carbonflux> people playing flute or the stringed qauan.
[10:50:44] <Carbonflux> its a very musical MMO
[10:51:11] <Carbonflux> sometime there are people just drumming
[10:51:24] <Carbonflux> you can use your dance emotes
[10:52:40] <MaNI> I think if theres one thing thats been proven in the last 10 years its that your openssl is insecure regardless of whether its an old static one or the distros latest and greatest patched version (where they've commented out the RNG) 
[10:55:07] <ERROH> yeah, but there are different levels of insecure
[10:55:18] <Renderwww> I feel very insecure at times
[10:55:35] <ERROH> same with level of putincockholstery, for carbo that one is pretty high
[10:56:20] <Renderwww> can't we solve it by stealing the superior proprietary microsoft ssl dll and run it through wine to get all our loonix security going?
[10:57:34] <MaNI> should just give up and send everything plain text, you don't have anything to hide anyway unless you are a russian spy, right?
[10:59:10] * Carbonflux runs around handing out thumb drives filled with "free porn."
[11:00:47] <Carbonflux> what i want to really know is how can you have so many openssl instancing running that statistical bundling is actually relevant?
[11:01:21] <Carbonflux> instances*
[11:02:52] <T`aZ> static people deserve the pain they asked for
[11:04:46] <Renderwww> just rebuild it and deploy it through your k√ºbernetees or whatever deveops bloat you are using!
[11:05:15] <Renderwww> to get that webscale website with 100 visits a day running again
[11:06:25] <MaNI> linux holds itself to too high a standard
[11:07:09] <MaNI> macos literally just  has people copying around folders with dependencies in, not necessarilly static but may as well be, and everyone cheers how amazing macOS is
[11:07:56] <MaNI> no package manager, no installers, just idiots dragging folders around
[11:08:13] <T`aZ> this sounds so nice
[11:10:26] <Renderwww> do they use zip files as a VCS?
[11:10:54] <MaNI> and well windows has all the complex side by side shit and whatnot, but realistically everyones just bundling their own deps as well, again not necessarily static but may as well be because you're still not going to be updating it without the vendor doing it for you
[11:11:10] <MaNI> so its not like any of the other platforms have solved this

[11:11:42] <Renderwww> uh, but don't you use the bingdows provided stuff for ssl as a normal windows developer?
[11:11:57] <Renderwww> firefucks and chromosome ship their own crap I guess
[11:14:10] <MaNI> if you're cross platform you just as likely bundle your own openssl instead of using ms specific stuff
[11:14:42] <MaNI> or even just if one of your deps is cross platform etc.
[11:15:50] <Renderwww> as a proper windows developer I only us what I can find in MSDN!
[11:19:49] <Carbonflux> what about writing your own secure sockets from scratch? Its not That hard really.
[11:20:23] <Renderwww> just use a rust one, it's save!

[15:47:22] <jotham> and yet pay more than most countries
[15:47:39] <jotham> lots of that is because we don't have european farm subsidies, and haven't utterly destroyed africas economy, like you guys
