[01:28:51] <stenno> yes, you do nothing with i

[01:30:31] <stenno> yes but its only set once
[01:30:38] <stenno> so if its < 0.7 it will be an endless loop
[01:30:48] <stenno> its not like you are generating a new random number each loop
[01:31:04] <stenno> you are generating a random number _once_ and then test against it constantly in the for loop

[01:36:02] <stenno> oh its an assignment?

[01:36:59] <stenno> ...and what is the actual assignment?
[01:37:50] <d3x0r> for( let l = 0; l < 7; l++ ) { let randomTHing=Math.random(); foo.push(randomThing); }
[01:37:52] <lantech19446> there's a few parts to it the part i'm working on right now is this In the attached code assignment.js, you find a variable that holds a random number between 0 and 1. Write code that shows an alert (with any message) when that number is greater than 0.7.
[01:38:17] <d3x0r> oh there's nothing about a loop then
[01:38:18] <stenno> lantech19446: so you want `if` instead of `for`
[01:38:55] <lantech19446> so i could make this an if else statement and do it just as easily
[01:39:30] <lantech19446> I over analyzed it and put a loop in because that's what the last several classes were about I didn't realize i could use if else
[01:40:00] <d3x0r> for( ; randomNumber > 0.7; ) { ... }  would work I guess
[01:40:14] <d3x0r> well no that would do it forever
[01:40:23] <stenno> just don't use a for loop
[01:40:29] <stenno> but an if statement
[01:41:37] <lantech19446> I can do if randomNumber > .7 alert(etc) else rando() and that I would think would work
[01:42:27] <stenno> you can do a lot of things, but if you just want to give an alert when randomNumber is > .7
[01:42:34] <stenno> you don't need to assign it again or anything
[01:42:46] <stenno> at least assuming that is the exact wording of the assignment
[01:42:53] <lantech19446> I copied and pasted it

[02:49:36] <lantech19446> is there anyone who just gets this stuff when it's their first language? Like am I being extra dense or does everyone struggle this much
[02:50:00] <phantomotap> i certainly did
[02:51:08] <slaughter> I found it like a tiered knowledge thing. You struggle until something clicks and that gets you a step higher, then you find the next thing to struggle with until it clicks and up another step. And on and on
[02:51:24] <lantech19446> I'm gonna have to go back and watch these loop videos a third time I got the if statements pretty well just didn't realize I could use one there but loops I'm fucking lost no matter how many times i get help on them
[02:51:55] <hax> what kind of loops are you struggling with?
[02:52:04] <phantomotap> lantech19446: don't give up; you'll get it with time.
[02:52:52] <lantech19446> right now it's nested for loops trying to iterate an array and I got it to work with just one for of loop going forwards but i need a second loop that goes backwards and I can't get them to nest properly
[02:53:28] <slaughter> Share your code :)
[02:54:21] <lantech19446> I've changed it so many times i'm not sure it works at all right now but this is what i have currently https://pastebin.com/XiwqYWHQ
[02:54:49] <hax> are you getting a syntax error, or something unexpected? yes, code please! jsbin, codepen, jsfiddle
[02:55:52] <pavonia> Not sure what you're trying to do, but setting the loop variable in the loop termination check is almost certainly wrong (`for(;i = myArray.length -1; i--)`)
[02:56:16] <hax> yeah, define i before the ; in the inside loop
[02:56:44] <hax> and you don't have an array that requires nested loops
[02:56:50] <lantech19446> ok apparently whatever I changed I get another infinite loop :( that's the issue with this setup
[02:57:14] <lantech19446> they want 2 loops one going forwards one going backwards, how do I do that using the same array if I don't nest them?
[02:57:23] <hax> you  just need a counter that counts from the front or the rear of the array
[02:57:44] <lantech19446> they actually specify that it has to be a loop this time
[02:58:04] <hax> when i is 0, you print index 0 and array.length-(1+i)
[02:58:47] <hax> myArray[myArray.length-(1+i)]
[02:59:06] <hax> oh. does it say you have to nest them?
[02:59:51] <hax> you normally use nested loops for traversing nested arrays, ie  [ [], [], [], [] ]

[03:01:48] <hax> yeah, the for syntax is wrong too. it's for (init counter; continue condition, change counter)
[03:02:57] <lantech19446> when I tried to un nest them it told me it couldn't iterate myArray which I took to mean that it wouldn't work if it wasn't nested unless I created 2 arrays
[03:04:07] <hax> you'd have to share that exact error too, because as it is, nesting isn't your issue
[03:04:22] <hax> you need to follow slaughter's advice and re-read the docs

[03:08:02] <lantech19446> I think I also need to move the array outside of the function so it's global
[03:08:20] <hax> and keep going until you get to for loops, or skip to https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/iterate-with-javascript-for-loops

[06:02:02] <OhTheCode> i've got a silly question, I don't know react. If i build a component in react, something like a custom date-picker, would that have a custom tag eg <date-picker> ? I never see these custom tags in production HTML. As far as I know, with react, you build it like <div class="date-picker"......
[06:04:48] <robertmaxrees> it's compiled down into something the browser understands.  your code contains those custom tags, but the browser receives plain ol' HTML.

[06:10:36] <OhTheCode> i'm just looking at a web components library ie all these web components already made eg drop down lists, date pickers, buttons, inputs etc etc, called UI5 from SAP. to include a button - <ui5-button id="btn">This is a button</ui5-button>, but this wouldn't work in those browsers. There are other component libraries like this eg Lion
[06:14:26] <robertmaxrees> you mean https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/ ?
[06:14:42] <ljharb> web components are a well-intentioned disaster
[06:14:45] <ljharb> i wouldn't bother with them
[06:15:01] <robertmaxrees> because that just looks like a component library that you can use with react, angular, and vue.
[06:16:23] <OhTheCode> yeah ok, it wasn't making sense to me. The web components API is a big stuff up I'm finding out. Better to do web components in React/Vue etc.
[06:16:57] <ljharb> better to just do react
[06:17:01] <ljharb> not "web components in react"
[06:17:26] <OhTheCode> ok, u probably saved me hours or days
[06:17:35] <robertmaxrees> react and web components are two different things fwiw.  you can use web components IN react, but like ljharb said - just use react.
[06:17:50] <OhTheCode> yeah ok
[06:17:56] <Tabmow> So I'm trying to use that compare-pdf library - and I get the following error: https://imgur.com/a/iCay3k8 - is that a library issue or potentially some module etc. I might be missing? Google is failing me...
[06:18:10] <OhTheCode> i don't know why some smart devs have raved about lit Element though
[06:18:20] <Tabmow> I'm following the example as set out in https://github.com/marcdacz/compare-pdf/tree/master/examples/cypress
[06:21:04] <OhTheCode> hax, ljharb, robertmaxrees - thanks

[06:31:55] <austincheney> Tabmow, 2 things:  1) That library, Cypress, has excellent error handling  2) Despite what it says the problem is likely in their code unless the library is evaluating your code
[06:33:01] <austincheney> Tabmow, "cannot read properties of 'undefined'" error messaging means undefined was passed into a function that expected to receive an object
[06:33:29] <austincheney> undefined and null cannot have properties assigned to them and so executing them as functions or properties upon them will always throw an error
[06:34:38] <austincheney> that means two problems:  1) a failure in flow control because undefined should not be passed into whatever function,  2) this scenario is not being handled properly in that library.

[06:35:12] <austincheney> that library should instead trap the error by checking for undefined or null arguments and then yelling at you, the user, for doing something unplanned
[06:36:33] <Tabmow> austincheney: I'm never interacting with that module directory so I'm not exactly sure what's happening. The test code is super simple where I just pass it 2 files - I've tried absolute/relative paths etc. just in case I was doing something wrong but it always errors there.

[10:07:49] <ljharb> !promises intro @ daoudr
[10:07:49] <jellobot> daoudr, Promises are placeholders for values that'll be provided in the future. They allow composing asynchronous operations like synchronous ones. See http://robotlolita.me/2015/11/15/how-do-promises-work.html and https://blog.domenic.me/youre-missing-the-point-of-promises/. Contrast with !cps & see https://bevacqua.github.io/promisees/. Another guide: http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/javascriptpromises.shtml
[10:08:29] <daoudr> I aint struggling with the conncept of promise but the syntax used to explain how promise works under the hood
[10:09:18] <ljharb> those are all the same thing
[10:09:45] <ljharb> part of the concept of JS promises is the revealing constructor pattern, and how `.then` works with callbacks

[10:41:37] *** Joins: Lazenca (~lazenca@user/lazenca)
[10:42:24] <DPA> Fundamentally, a Promise is a then-able object. This means it has a then method. You can pass functions as parameters to the then method to be called for when it resolves, or for when it rejects. In case of a promise, it does that after you call the resolve or reject method of the promise, but asynchronously.
[10:42:24] <DPA> Promise.resolve(thenable_object) and "async thenable_object" both call the then function of an object, and pass them a resolve / reject function.
[10:42:24] <DPA> The former is like new Promose((resolve,reject)=>thenable_object.then(resolve,reject)); So it just creates a new promose and let's it get resolved or rejected. The latter, with async, makes an async function continue execution or throw when resolve/reject is called.
[10:42:42] *** Joins: earendel (uid498179@user/earendel)
[10:43:14] <ljharb> that's not entirely accurate
[10:43:57] <ljharb> a Promise is actually something special that *happens* to be thenable; it has internal state. `Promise.resolve` takes any value, not just a thenable; and you mean `await x` not `async x`
[10:44:16] <ljharb> and `new Promise` is also fundamentally different than how the return value of `.then` is handled.

[11:00:15] <DPA> Let's put it differently. JS has an event loop. Various things, such as HTTP requests which take a while / don't complete immediately. And there are things like events, which could happen at any point.
[11:00:15] <DPA> For that, callbacks can be registered. So when they happen, they are put in a queue, and when nothing else runs, the JS engine starts calling the callbacks.
[11:00:15] <DPA> Many things, like HTTP requests, only finish once, and can succeed or fail. Promomises are one of 2 common patterns for dealing with that. Before promises, we just used 1 callback, and the first parameter was set if an error occured. But it lead to nesting tons of callbacks, so with promises and then, a composable interface was created.
[11:01:49] <ljharb> JS doesn't actually have an event loop :-)

[17:53:45] <harpia> in php we can use foreach ($_POST['example'] as $key => $value) {}
[17:54:19] <OhTheCode> Sal` - what's button?
[17:55:51] <OhTheCode> harpia - const elForm = document.form.querySelector('form'), then you could do something like elForm.children
[17:56:04] <OhTheCode> Array.from(elForm.children)
[17:57:10] <harpia> I thought I could use FormData.getAll('example'), but it returns an empty array instead.
[17:57:46] <harpia> only works if you do FormData.getAll('example[1][example]')
[17:59:03] <harpia> which means you have to manage the index yourself.

[20:50:52] <z1haze> I am genuinely curious if I am one of the few people who actually care about quality of work being produced, or if maybe I am just in a particular niche industry where quality is always second to whatever else, but I keep finding myself in positions where the people I work for, work with only "pretend" to care about the quality of working being produced, but actually only care about money
[20:51:41] <hassoon> actually both matter, money and quality of your code
[20:51:54] <z1haze> I point out significant issues in quality and am told oh yea we will definitely take a look into fixing this, and I ask if I can fix it, said no we need you doing something else. Over a year later the same quality issues persist. I guess this is my venting, but I have become increasingly unhappy in my profession due to the shit quality being produced at my work
[20:51:55] <hassoon> because good quality software is what brings money

[20:53:29] <z1haze> I work remotely
[20:53:35] <z1haze> everyone in my company does
[20:53:57] <z1haze> in the US
[20:53:59] <hassoon> is the company national ?
[20:54:01] <hassoon> ah the USA
[20:54:04] <hamess> similar case, quality doesn't seem to really matter unless i can squeeze it in between the deadlines..  or weekends.
[20:54:31] <z1haze> I am feeling myself slowly becoming more jaded each passing day
[20:54:54] <hassoon> z1haze: try to find a better company and ask about it carefully first ?
[20:54:59] <z1haze> I feel that I need to force myself to stop giving a damn, and then just enjoy my life outside of my day job.
[20:55:11] <hamess> i work on my own stuff on the weekends where i can enforce my own rules
[20:55:15] <z1haze> the company I work for has a reputation for being one of the best in the business
[20:55:46] <hassoon> z1haze: anyway i asked about your location because i guess you might be located in a place whose working mindset is not based on quality work
[20:55:53] <hassoon> z1haze: ah i see
[20:55:54] <z1haze> hamess, yes of course. but then that requires you to do on your computer even more, and doing more work just to get the fulfillment. I have a family and while I spend a lot of time on the computer and love to code, it becomes a problem
[20:56:33] <z1haze> I have worked at several places doing what I do, this one is definitely above the others, but its SO FAR from good
[20:56:57] <z1haze> I would move to a different market but the money wouldnt be nearly as good, and let's face it. I like getting paid
[20:57:35] <hassoon> you guys in us are well paid ?
[20:57:41] <hassoon> nice
[20:57:46] <z1haze> very well paid
[20:57:51] <z1haze> extremely well

[20:59:05] <hamess> z1haze: understandable. i don't have many responsibilities
[20:59:11] <z1haze> yeah, my world is very small when it comes to what i work on, so the demand is high ,and its not something anyone can just walk into doing

[21:01:45] <systemfault> In your niche, probably not.
[21:02:09] <z1haze> I grew up, here on IRC, i learned everything from incredibly talented people
[21:02:21] <z1haze> they probably dont make a fraction of what they deserve, based on the salaries of people I work with

[21:03:31] <systemfault> I'm a guy with no degree, did not take the chance to get a programming job for years because I thought I sucked hard compared to all the college people.
[21:03:41] <hassoon> z1haze: what about the 1 who knows, who are they ? :o
[21:03:47] <systemfault> Because I thought that everyone was at least as good as the people on IRC.

[21:04:27] <hassoon> systemfault: then what happened ?
[21:04:33] <z1haze> systemfault, totally, I felt that EXACT same way
[21:04:50] <z1haze> I still do, to be honest, when i am in here
[21:04:53] <hassoon> systemfault: you got a decent job with your decent irc knowledge, and most of college people are still jobeless ?
[21:04:59] <hassoon> i mean now
[21:06:04] <systemfault> hassoon: I live in North America... and one thing that is right here is that "usually", companies don't care that much about degrees.
[21:06:10] <hassoon> ya i dropped out of college because it felt a complete waste of my time, my energy and the quality of relationships i found myself hooked to
[21:06:10] <z1haze> I got my curiousity back in like 1999, 2000, playing fps video games and seeing clan websites, and gaming ladders. I thought flash was so cool. I don't have a design bone in my body, my creativity is vitrually non existant, but i wanted it so badly
[21:06:28] <z1haze> as I got older, i learned everything backwards
