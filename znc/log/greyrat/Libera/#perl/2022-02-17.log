[00:23:08] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ BorgBackup – Deduplicating archiver with compression and authenticated encryption ]
[00:23:14] <simcop2387> it's wonderful actually
[00:23:16] <gordonfish> Sounds swedish
[00:24:18] <simcop2387> there's a nice frontend called borgmatic i've been starting to use for most things too.  handles expiring old backups and keeping things nicely rotated.
[00:26:49] <gordonfish> Interesting, will take a look at that.
[00:27:32] <rindolf> simcop2387: your data are bigger than mine ;]
[00:28:15] <simcop2387> the deduping of blocks and compression are really really nice.  for the server perlbot runs on, these are the stats, original size, compressed size, and deduped size: All archives:               62.24 TB             27.30 TB            566.70 GB
[00:28:45] <simcop2387> so if it was completely decompressed and duplicated, it's be 62 TB, just compressed 27.30 TB, but actual on disk storage is only 566 TB.
[00:28:48] <simcop2387> er GB
[00:29:33] <gordonfish> simcop2387: Cool. Like any good compression, it's all about finding and collapsing all the redundant/repetative bits
[00:29:36] <simcop2387> put it onto a reliable disk store of some kind and as long as not much changes between each backup you can have a lot of them since it's all nicely indexed deduped blocks
[00:29:55] <simcop2387> yea incremental backups REALLY benefit from the whole redundant stuff
[00:30:20] <simcop2387> ZFS dedup + snapshots could probably accomplish the same, but that needs more ram, more time, etc. than this

[01:00:22] <rindolf> kjetilho: I've been to two workplaces that gave me an old computer with a 40 GB hard-disk. It wasn't enough at all. At one place, we've reached the limit of this hard-disk due to several large source code checkouts, and as a result needed a bigger hard-disk. And the only hard-disks the lab had were 80 GB ones, which were bought because they were the cheapest (per-disk, not per-capacity). Please, <emphasis

[01:00:52] <kjetilho> if it is "one full backup of the data per day", then it's a bit misleading.  incremental backup has been a thing since age eternal
[01:00:55] <simcop2387> and every perl install for perlbot
[01:01:22] <vanfanel64> 40 GB? With modern windows that'd leave you with about 20 MB of space to use
[01:01:24] *** Joins: ugjka (~ugjka@ugjka.net)
[01:01:28] <simcop2387> kjetilho: it'd be the 62TB if it was a full backup per day is the idea.  the incremental backups take up 560gb
[01:01:49] <kjetilho> so it's not really "dedup" at all, then...
[01:01:55] <mmlj4> you say that, but...   nathan:~$ dudepth ~/.config/hexchat/logs/ | tail -1      849M    /home/jkelly/.config/hexchat/logs/
[01:02:14] <simcop2387> kjetilho: how so? the "incremental"ness is from it deduping the data.
[01:02:33] <vanfanel64> mmlj4, damn, have you heard of gz/bzip2/xz/lzma/etc
[01:02:33] <kjetilho> it's a very exaggarated number
[01:03:08] <mmlj4> vanfanel64: can you ask the hexchat devs to implement that for their logs?
[01:03:10] <simcop2387> kjetilho: no it's not.  560gb is the actual stored data, 62TB is the uncompressed non-incremental representation of it, so if i extracted it all directly, that's how much it would actually take to store.
[01:03:43] <vanfanel64> 560 GB from 64 TB? Is this real?
[01:03:55] <simcop2387> vanfanel64: yes, because pretty much all of it is identical
[01:04:21] <kjetilho> vanfanel64: he's making one extra hardlink per day, so every day is saves 560 G extra.  the dedup ratio is going through the roof!
[01:04:36] <vanfanel64> sweet frozen solos, that is a killer compression rate
[01:04:37] <simcop2387> vanfanel64: for the last specific backup it looks like: total data: 121.60 GB      compression:       46.88 GB   total difference stored:         492.44 M
[01:04:42] <rindolf> vanfanel64: that was in 2007
[01:04:43] <simcop2387> kjetilho: there are no hard links involved
[01:05:00] <kjetilho> simcop2387: I know, but it would work almost as well.
[01:05:16] <kjetilho> don't get me wrong, I love dedup, I use Restic myself
[01:05:27] <simcop2387> kjetilho: no using hard links like that doesn't work like that at all.  using restic you should know that.
[01:06:01] <kjetilho> I'm just saying your "dedup" savings is nonsensical.
[01:06:10] <gordonfish> I've done hard link based incremental backups using rsync before, but this really looks great.
[01:06:44] <kjetilho> simcop2387: how big is the source filesystem?
[01:06:55] <simcop2387> kjetilho: 180GB, 120GB filled

[11:29:26] <vanessa> hi. what does 'Substitution replacement not terminated at -e line 1.' mean when I run `echo "\int_{4}{5} x^2 dx" | perl -pe 's/\\/\\\\/g'` ?
[11:30:21] <vague> vanessa, try more backslash maybe?
[11:30:46] <tirnanog> that the perl command either wasn't entered exactly as you've shown there or you're using a very weird shell.
[11:31:03] <vanessa> I wanted to convert \int to \\int
[11:31:16] <vanessa> tirnanog: my shell is fish
[11:31:38] <tirnanog> that's your problem then.
[11:31:50] <tirnanog> ask someone that knows fish how to translate that as if it were bourne-style code.
[11:31:56] <tirnanog> or just use a non-esoteric shell.
[11:32:17] <tirnanog> there's probably a fish channel on this network.
[11:34:14] <vanessa> tirnanog: yes that works in bash
[11:34:21] <Botje> vanessa: if you prefix "perl" with "echo" you will get back the command as perl sees it. but yes, probably fish is eating the quotes.
[11:34:26] <Botje> *backslashes
[11:35:42] <vanessa> yes, fish was eating my backslashes
[11:36:26] <vanessa> echo "\int_{4}^{5} x^2 dx" | perl -p -e 's/\\\\/\\\\\\\\/g' worked
[11:36:29] <vague> backslashes are a taste treat apparently

[18:28:17] <choroba> and for is shorter, so it wins for me
[18:29:33] <Altreus> you can write a microservice using an MVC architecture
[18:29:49] <Altreus> You can write a monolith without it
[18:34:36] <tm604> indeed, a model can consist of lots of microservices
[18:34:55] <krismatrix> hmm...so what exactly makes a microservice?
[18:35:12] <tm604> a service that's very small, preferably doing only one thing
[18:35:46] <krismatrix> yeah..but what is a 'service'?
[18:35:52] <Altreus> something that does something
[18:35:57] <krismatrix> lol
[18:36:02] <Altreus> what else could it be
[18:36:15] <tm604> perhaps start with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture ?
[18:36:15] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Service-oriented architecture - Wikipedia ]
[18:36:20] <revhippie> Is the "echo" port a microservice or a nanoservice?
[18:36:35] <krismatrix> Cuz now i am wordering whether I built a microservice naturally..or a monolith.
[18:36:46] <krismatrix> if they both can be mvc's.
[18:36:50] <revhippie> Microlith?
[18:37:14] <krismatrix> lol
[18:37:19] <Altreus> multilith
[18:37:27] <tm604> if you have only a single process, it's probably not microservices
[18:37:38] <tm604> and if you're not sure, it's probably not microservices
[18:37:59] <Altreus> maybe it only does one thing so it's micro by default
[18:38:07] <krismatrix> that is a reasonable statement. 
[18:38:26] <krismatrix> because the other way people have explained it is that usually each service has it's own Database
[18:38:31] <krismatrix> but what does that mean.
[18:38:48] <krismatrix> For example my captcha system uses a redis database...and presently that is the only think that uses Redis.
[18:38:53] <krismatrix> Everything else uses postgres.
[18:39:09] <tm604> you mean everything else *shares* a single postgres database?
[18:39:42] <krismatrix> yeah.
[18:39:58] <krismatrix> userdata, podcast information, etc are all in pg.
[18:40:01] <tm604> hella monolithic then
[18:40:33] <krismatrix> my site isn't too big to need multiple massive pg databases.
[18:40:45] <tm604> then it doesn't need microservices either

[18:44:09] <krismatrix> so i guess if i was doing microservices...i could still have ONE controller file with multiple controller functions. And if one of those functions deals with userdata, then that userdata is in a separate pg database. If the another controller function(method?) deals with podcast data, then that podcast data is in another pg database..then is THIS a microservice?

[18:47:16] <tm604> an exact definition of microservices tends to vary, but what you're describing is really not something where microservices would be useful
[18:47:32] <Altreus> A good start is to use models and avoid breaking encapsulation - so MVC can, sort of, be microservice, view, controller
[18:47:51] <tm604> being able to update/restart any component at any time, having reliable message protocols connecting things, able to split up work across a large team - things like this are where microservices start to become more interesting
[18:48:04] <Altreus> You can usually turn something into microservices as long as you didn't couple things together, which is what happens naturally in a monolith
[18:48:15] <LeoNerd> Are there borderline descriptions of miliservice and nanoservice, for when it gets either too big or too small to be called a "microservice"?

[21:05:59] <buu> I wish I could get around to actually writing blogs, but exceptions seem to lead to treating "errors" differently from "successes" which rarely seems to go well in "real world" programming

[23:08:36] <vague> Grinnz, can I set the default content_type? https://docs.mojolicious.org/Mojolicious/Types says the default is application/octet-stream when I'd like it to be text/plain

[23:09:11] *** Joins: deadmarshal (~deadmarsh@95.38.116.130)
[23:09:35] <Grinnz> no, but you can add more type mappings via $app->types
[23:10:08] <Grinnz> otherwise you have to go through the router and serve the file yourself with a custom content type
[23:11:33] <vague> I don't have a filetype to add though. But maybe I can check if the file has a filetype and if not set it content_type to text/plain
[23:13:05] <gordonfish> Curious why htm is defined as 'text/html' while html is 'text/html;charset=UTF-8' ? I would have thought that those two file extensions to be synonyms.
[23:13:07] <ether> iirc it's $c->reply({ 'text/plain' => '...' }), once you add the $app->types
[23:13:18] <ether> or you can assign any alias to it you want really
[23:14:05] <Grinnz> there's in fact an example of serving a static file with custom content type https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious::Plugin::DefaultHelpers#reply-%3Estatic
