[08:13:32] <amigojapan> mwsb: I talk to non existing people all the time in my dreams

[08:15:07] <amigojapan> mwsb: that theory does not convince me solipsism is not real
[08:16:36] <amigojapan> It's not as obvious as cogito ergo sum is
[08:17:14] <mwsb> So, Wittgenstein would say meaning is use - basically a social convention.
[08:19:52] <amigojapan> Ok mwsb I can go that far . Yes
[08:19:53] <greeb> amigojapan: they could be hallucinations, but does that make them any less real considering the constraints of your perception as it is right now?
[08:20:40] <amigojapan> greeb: how about for those crazy people that talk to nobody on the streets?
[08:21:12] <greeb> what about them?
[08:22:00] <amigojapan> greeb: the "people"they talk to could really be ignored and probably nothing would change for them
[08:23:02] <amigojapan> greeb: I could be one of those people and everyone I interact with could be just a sort of dream
[08:23:03] <greeb> could you follow in suit after logging off of libera.chat/philosopy?
[08:23:17] <mycroftiv> is there actually any difference between me being unreal and dreamed or simulated by others and me being all that is real and dreaming and simulating everyone? noumena vs phenomena is always like this
[08:23:30] <amigojapan> What do you mean greeb
[08:25:09] <amigojapan> mycroftiv: I think there is a difference if you are unreal and not really consious.a "philosophical zombie"
[08:27:15] <amigojapan> I treat dream people after I wake up as if they are philosophical zobies
[08:28:23] <mycroftiv> amigojapan: i think it is ethically unwise to ever decide that anything that externally seems to suffer as convincingly as we do is a zombie, because the risk of error is too high
[08:29:00] <mycroftiv> so i think we already may be falling into grave moral error in our assunption that the universe is mostly unfeeling, especially computers
[08:29:33] <amigojapan> mycroftiv: even dream people?
[08:30:21] <amigojapan> Or people you see when you take lsd? I have never taken LSD
[08:32:30] <amigojapan> mycroftiv: as far as I go for the walking world. I live as if solipsism is false. It is more comfortable that was. And I also can't be sure solipsism is true
[08:32:51] <amigojapan> Waking world*
[08:33:43] <amigojapan> It is more comfortable that way*
[08:34:44] <greeb> amigojapan: what I mean is that if you really believed that then you would be living a totally limitless existence. there would be no discussion in libera.chat/philosophy about solipsism. you wouldn't be questioning it to begin with. that you're questioning the existence of the solipsistic mind further disproves it. taking into account your relation to others, whether they are "real" or not,
[08:34:46] <greeb> doesn't uphold a solipsistic state, it undermines it.
[08:35:20] <amigojapan> mycroftiv: and I think it would be ok for one of those crazy people talking to nobody in the streets to ignore their hallucinations
[08:35:56] *** Quits: Delf (Delf@user/delf) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[08:36:48] <amigojapan> greeb: the crazy people who talk to nobody on the street are kind of real solipsists no ?
[08:36:57] <greeb> no they're not
[08:37:05] <amigojapan> HMmm
[08:37:20] <greeb> you're mistaking nobody for somebody
[08:37:59] <amigojapan> greeb: I am assuming they are people there that don't exist
[08:38:19] <amigojapan> 1:07 PM <amigojapan> greeb: I am assuming they see people there that don't exist
[08:39:44] <amigojapan> The people they see are indeed philosophical zobies
[08:39:59] <greeb> Whatever "they" is (people you don't see but maybe others do), is there, though. Does that make sense?
[08:40:50] <amigojapan> Not really greeb
[08:41:56] <amigojapan> Reality is the realm of shared experiences we have with others
[08:42:12] <greeb> yes that's sort of what I'm getting at
[08:42:31] <greeb> there's a shared experience with something/someone you can't percieve when you come across someone talking to "nobody"
[08:42:50] <greeb> i before e except after c, s/percieve/perceive/
[08:43:29] <amigojapan> greeb: I find that doubtful and so does science. Doctors constantly try to get rid of hallucinations
[08:46:00] <amigojapan> greeb: and in many cases they succeed
[08:46:08] <greeb> but your whole argument is about solipsism, no? about how no interaction can be proven to be anything but a hallucination or at best a sort of projection.
[08:46:43] <amigojapan> Right
[08:46:55] <amigojapan> Wait
[08:47:23] <amigojapan> greeb: I am just saying "solipsism can't be disproven"
[08:47:32] <amigojapan> Not that it is real
[08:49:56] <greeb> solipsism can be disproved by going on a walk or logging into an IRC channel about philosophy. I'm sorry, but the idea that something is "real" is not important, because you've failed to establish what's real. Try going out into the world and exercising a solipsistic mode and see how far it gets you.
[08:50:16] <greeb> and, I'll add
[08:52:16] <amigojapan> greeb: I said I don't believe solipsism is real. Just that it is a non dispensable proposition. If you went out into the world and treated people as if they are not real no doubt you life would turn for the worse
[08:52:38] <amigojapan> Your life*
[08:54:19] <amigojapan> s/non dispensable/non disprovable/
[08:54:19] <ro-bot-o> amigojapan meant to say: greeb: I said I don't believe solipsism is real. Just that it is a non disprovable proposition. If you went out into the world and treated people as if they are not real no doubt you life would turn for the worse
[08:56:43] <amigojapan> And I don't think a normal person would go out there and try to treat people as if they were not real. That would land you in a looney bin
[08:56:59] <greeb> I think what I'm arguing against then is the merit of it being unfalsifiable beyond an exercise of philosophy.
[08:58:14] <mycroftiv> it is very hard to operate successfully in standard reality when taking seriously the idea i am inside a simulation run by aliens trying to imagine what beings on other planets might be like
[08:58:23] <amigojapan> greeb: then falsify it for me please
[08:58:41] <mycroftiv> i do take this idea and other nonstandard ontologies seriously and it totally screws up my day to day living
[08:59:25] <mycroftiv> i dont understand how standard religious people deal with the god concept in a healthy way, i find it totally destabilizing
[08:59:49] <mycroftiv> the idea that at any moment , a miracle could happen is exactly what my manic delusions feel like to me
[08:59:56] <amigojapan> mycroftiv: what if when you die, you wake up in an arcade store and the sign says "insert token to play again"? :)

[09:52:19] <amigojapan> mwsb: in the case of people arguing that "the self is an illusion"we just need to ask "who is experiencing the illusion?"
[09:52:38] <amigojapan> Who is experiencing*
[09:53:29] <amigojapan> You need a self to experience an illusion
[09:58:12] <mwsb> I don't know much about Dennett but I believe he thinks the self is an illusion. I don't know what his argument is, but I imagine he responds to that

[10:14:11] *** Joins: toulene (~toulene@user/toulene)
[10:15:18] <mwsb> Dummett bases his metaphysics on intuitionistic logic and so plays with an idea of Truth vs truth
[10:15:40] <mycroftiv> ive studied intuitionism a lot because i do constructive type theory in agda to study things
[10:15:49] <mwsb> Nice, I figured :)
[10:16:34] <mycroftiv> the distinction between constructive existential 'i have a witness' vs classical which can be not-not-exist without providing the specific example is really deep
[10:17:00] <mwsb> Bob Meyer was a relevant logician who conjectured a relationship like type theory and intuitionistic logic might exist between relevant logic and lambda calculus (I cannot recall if he meant typed or untyped though). I have no clue how far that was explored though
[10:18:45] <mycroftiv> i see all the connections and mirrorings as evidence/validation for the objectivite links between physical reality and our ideas of logic, because computation with machines lines up too well for it to be coincidence
[10:19:19] <mwsb> Definitely
[10:19:54] <mycroftiv> if our ideas about logic were somehow purely illusory/subjective, they shouldnt have ended up precisely lining up with the provable capabilities of physical machines and quantum information theory
[10:20:11] <mycroftiv> theres an intuitionistic angle on quantum logic as well that is fairly subtle
[10:21:05] <mycroftiv> depending on how you frame things, you can say quantum mechanics is intuitionistic in nature rather than classical, although its dependent on how you set up the formal description

[13:16:28] <Atque> amigojapan: Your question presupposes a subject. It is not a question someone requires an answer for. For example, I could ask you "Why did you steal from Sue?", but you did not steal from Sue and so there is no answer that is called for by the question.
[13:17:35] <amigojapan> Atque: so does illusion presupose a self
[13:17:50] <amigojapan> its silly to talk about an illusion withought a self
[13:20:11] <Atque> amigojapan: No, it does not. For example, Kant pursued a decomposition of the self into fleeting subjective states. It could be as though as a candle burning, with no inherent object behind the flame. It could just be a cascade of states.
[13:21:05] <amigojapan> I dont follow

[13:56:58] <arryana> squishy did, but she has only ever used 'food', 'water' and 'no'
[13:57:04] <pussipupu> I don't know where (if anywhere) I'd draw the line on that

[14:00:37] <amigojapan> pussipupu: flies are my relatives
[14:00:42] <arryana> for no particular reason my other half has thurs and friday off, so there'll be a four day weekend happening here too
[14:01:12] <pussipupu> so if we at some point can understand a fly as well as a drone you'll stop assuming it's conscious?

[14:10:48] <mwsb> Selling yourself a little short
[14:11:40] <amigojapan> mwsb: I think it is not yet forseable since we dont know what is the bit that creates the consious part, even if we know it is the brain, we dont understand and cant reproduce it yet.

[14:19:39] <pussipupu> Private languages aren't a contradiction, we can be in society with lions until they eat us, to some extent we can already communicate with them and language would make that easier

[14:21:25] <arryana> i don 't think i would consider that of their own volition

[14:22:19] <arryana> a windchime -generates- music, but it does not create it
[14:23:19] <amigojapan> wittingston has some strange arguments
[14:23:47] <arryana> a windchime is not a composer, and a program that churns out responses is not consciously doing so.
[14:24:19] <arryana> it isn't 'a thinker'
[14:25:35] <arryana> and as to your earlier statement, atque, i disagree completely
[14:26:04] <arryana> it is perfectly possible for a human being to be part of a wolf pack, which requires no human language at all

[14:38:20] <arryana> how is them learning to use phrases any different from a child learning?
[14:38:47] <Maxdamantus> A child doesn't just learn to recognise words.
[14:39:15] <Maxdamantus> Children learn grammatical structure too, in such a way that they can eventually express complex thoughts.
[14:39:28] <arryana> the dogs use combinations of buttons as well, and they were not taught that.
[14:39:45] <arryana> often as many as four and five, to string together a more complex idea
[14:40:07] <arryana> if it were an autistic child using speech buttons, would it be communication from them?
[14:40:25] <Maxdamantus> I'm not saying it's not communication.
[14:40:35] <Maxdamantus> Just not language.
[14:40:41] <arryana> i can't agree.
[14:41:01] <arryana> is it language when stephen hawking does it?
[14:41:23] <Maxdamantus> Yes. Stephen Hawking had the same language faculties as any other human.
[14:41:35] <Maxdamantus> It's just the communication part that was more difficult.
[14:41:52] <arryana> just because they have no ability for -human- speech does not mean they're not using language when they use buttons which speak phrases.
[14:42:03] <amigojapan> Pretty sure sign language is a language
[14:42:07] <arryana> here's a question.
[14:42:44] <Maxdamantus> Yes, sign languages are human languages, and they involve the same human language faculties as other human languages.
[14:42:58] <arryana> if i ask my dogs something like, 'do you want to go outside in the rain?' and they respond with the 'no' and 'wet' buttons in that order, have they then used language by your definition?
[14:43:07] <Maxdamantus> (Stephen Hawking didn't use sign language, if that's what you [amigojapan] were suggesting)
[14:43:58] <amigojapan> No that's not what I am suggesting . Deaf people do
[14:44:10] <Maxdamantus> arryana: not necessarily. You could probably induce the same response by asking "do you want to stay inside from the rain?"
[14:44:42] <Maxdamantus> amigojapan: right, so they're using language in the same way, just communicating differently.
[14:44:44] <arryana> your response does not make sense to me
[14:44:56] <Maxdamantus> comminacion and language are quite distinct things. usually language is used without communication.
[14:45:03] <arryana> i don't understand why you're hooking extrapolation as a reason it isn't language
[14:45:19] <Maxdamantus> (particularly, most language use is just people internally talking to themselves)

[14:46:12] * arryana shrugs
[14:46:34] <arryana> when i'm not talking, i'm listening.  many people would be much happier if they tried it.
[14:49:39] <Maxdamantus> Maybe you could argue that in the last few years, it's possible that people started having words communicated to them most of their waking life, so maybe there's less internal monologue, though I suspect overall most people still mostly use language to talk to themselves (eg, when thinking about things, or deciding about things).
[14:50:03] <arryana> i don't know what you mean by any of that.
[14:50:26] <arryana> internal monologue isn't stopped by more words.
[14:50:45] <arryana> quite the opposite.  for me it stopped when i spent several months with no human contact of any kind.
[14:51:58] <Maxdamantus> The thing with internal monologue is that you don't normally take note of it, so you can't think back and figure out whether you were talking to yourself.
[14:52:14] <Maxdamantus> You can only recognise it if you think about it while you're doing it, like breathing.
[14:52:31] <arryana> you're clearly going to refuse to recognize any opinion other than your own on this, so i see no point discussing it further with you
[14:52:32] <amigojapan> Maxdamantus: I do have an internal monologue

[15:10:52] <amigojapan> Ah right
[15:11:09] <Maxdamantus> Anyway, breathing is the usual thing used to demonstrate this. If someone didn't know about the basic necessity of breathing, they might claim that they don't normally breathe.

[15:14:17] <amigojapan> Maxdamantus: I hear a voice when I read something. My own voice, but some people claim not to hear anything
[15:14:49] <Maxdamantus> amigojapan: right, but internal monologue doesn't have to involve a voice. Sometimes when I'm thinking, I hear a voice, sometimes I don't.
[15:15:02] <Maxdamantus> I'm aware that in either case, I can be using language.
[15:15:26] <amigojapan> Ah ok. I always hear a voice
[15:15:29] <Maxdamantus> I'm pretty sure I also have thoughts that don't involve language.
[15:16:12] <Maxdamantus> eg, I know that sometimes I can see a solution to a programming problem but can't really express it properly in words.
[15:16:17] <arryana> google suggests a solid proportion of the population has no internal monologue.
[15:16:57] * arryana wonders if there is corrolation to emotional stability
[15:17:30] <Maxdamantus> What, did they do studies where they have people in an fMRI machine for 24 hours and see whether or not they use the language parts of their brain?
[15:17:49] <arryana> it would be simple enough to test, no doubt
[15:18:01] <arryana> it's easy enough to test even informally.
[15:18:24] <Maxdamantus> You can't test it informally. I think the closest you could get is using fMRI.

[15:18:40] <arryana> one of the most noticeable differences i experience is that people with internal dialogues are largely deaf to any sounds that are outside their immediate area.
[15:19:56] <arryana> you're really big on making definitive statements that are just your opinion, aren't you
[15:20:10] <Maxdamantus> And you're not?
[15:20:19] <Maxdamantus> I've also Googled this before, btw.
[15:20:28] <Maxdamantus> And there are experts with various opinions on the matter.
[15:20:39] <amigojapan> Sometimes I even voice my internal monologue
[15:20:40] <Maxdamantus> They don't just say what you're saying.
[15:21:46] <arryana> whatever.
[15:22:11] <arryana> there are 'experts' on both sides of the argument. but apparently you can't see that.
[15:22:31] <arryana> i guess your internal monologue drowns them out
[15:22:32] * arryana giggles
[15:22:39] <Maxdamantus> I never claimed there weren't. All I said is that I'm sceptical of one of the positions.
[15:22:50] <Maxdamantus> You're the one that's claiming that one of the positions is definitively correct.
[15:23:12] <arryana> yes, i'm claiming that 'not everyone has an internal monologue'.
[15:23:17] <arryana> and that's true.  not everyone does.
[15:23:31] <arryana> so yeah.  i'm correct.
[15:23:41] <Maxdamantus> Okay, that's your opinion, which is also an opinion shared by some experts on the matter. There are also experts with other opinions.
[15:24:26] * arryana rolls her eyes and dismisses Maxdamantus further on this topic.
[15:24:50] <Maxdamantus> That's fine. I accept your dismissal.

[16:43:52] <mwsb> Perhaps interesting, the logical positivists would have said they were working with reality
[16:44:16] <arryana> hm?
[16:45:13] <mwsb> They basically claimed the only sentences worthy of consideration were sentences which could be evaluated empirically
[16:45:21] <mwsb> That metaphysics was largely nonsense
[16:45:21] <arryana> yeah, i don't feel that way.
[16:45:24] <arryana> well
[16:45:43] <arryana> there are less tangible things which are worthy of consideration.  however, beliefs are not facts.
[16:46:16] <arryana> take religion.  god is not a fact.  the ramifications of religious belief are still important.
[16:47:12] <mwsb> I guess they'd say something like a belief is a hypothesis which would be fully evaluated later when more evidence becomes available
[16:49:00] <arryana> huh
[16:49:36] <arryana> in my experience a hypothesis is a great thing for chatting about over a glass of wine, but a really poor one to stake much more on.
