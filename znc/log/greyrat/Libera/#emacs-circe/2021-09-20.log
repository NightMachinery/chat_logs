[23:33:58] <alismanickt> I can't get Circe to auto-authenticate me to Libera
[23:34:27] <alismanickt> I even just now got myself "locked out" of my name after retrying it too many times
[23:34:30] <alismanickt> Help?
[23:39:03] <bremner> alismanickt: I use a client cert to connect
[23:39:51] * alismanickt 's eyes roll back in his head
[23:40:18] <alismanickt> trying to get that to work with OFTC was what made me ragequit ERC just now
[23:41:08] <alismanickt> (the last straw, so to speak)
[23:41:11] <bremner> oh, I always forget. I access both oftc and libera via a bip instance that (painlessly) does the cert stuff
[23:41:22] <bremner> so I guess I got nothin'
[23:41:28] <alismanickt> What the hell is bip?
[23:41:35] <alismanickt> make it make sense ;_;
[23:41:39] <bremner> a bouncer / proxy
[23:43:17] <alismanickt> Forgive my whining. This has taken up my day so far when I have other things to do.
[23:51:28] <crowbar> alismanickt: sharing your current settings and someone might be able to help
[23:53:41] <alismanickt> crowbar: that's... what I did
[23:53:47] <alismanickt> That's the 0x0 paste
[23:54:18] <crowbar> that's why they don't pay me the big bucks.
[23:55:23] <alismanickt> crowbar: I had something simpler initially (written with the help of the docs) which didn't work
[23:55:45] <alismanickt> so what I pasted is a modified version of the built-in "Libera Chat" option
[23:55:50] <crowbar> yeah i was going to say reimplementing the libera config is probably not the way to go about it.  
[23:56:13] <alismanickt> Surely someone here has a bouncerless, certless config which works?
[23:56:38] <crowbar> I just remembered I'm using soju... so no.
[23:56:48] <alismanickt> (I looked up "use-package circe" on Google and haven't found anything which works yet)
[23:59:20] <crowbar> you can manually auth your nick?
