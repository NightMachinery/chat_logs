[00:36:39] <matsaman> bambanxx: client-side there's only really cookies & 'web storage', as far as I know; ...and storing information in the URI itself, I guess
[00:37:27] <bambanxx> matsaman do you know a external service easy to use for beginners? for store data, maybe a rest api or some like that?

[00:38:00] <jaawerth> oh you don't mean persistence then, you mean a backend?
[00:38:41] <jaawerth> for persistence in the brwoser, the main options are sessionStorage, localStorage, cookie, or indexeddb. localStorage/sessionStorage are the easiest by far but they don't always match up to one's needs and are the least secure option

[00:52:55] <ThePendulum> bambanxx: well if you want to store it outside of the web browser, you'll need a way to identify users, and it immediately becomes more advanced
[00:53:16] <ThePendulum> what do you mean store data on an array? just how to use arrays in general?
[00:53:48] <ThePendulum> because imo at that stage using anything more than localStorage is perhaps a bit too amibitious
[00:53:51] <matsaman> to me it sounds like you don't need a web app that stores data
[00:53:59] <matsaman> just an array that you can prove you're saving data to
[00:54:02] <matsaman> like programming 101 stuff
[00:54:07] <bambanxx> yeah
[00:54:14] <matsaman> so you need nothing special

[01:15:43] <systemfault> Gitlab is great
[01:15:52] <jaawerth> well, I haven't tried as many of github's recent advancements in CI and such but I really like gitlab CI

[01:16:40] <qswz> no docker and stuff
[01:17:03] <jaawerth> gitlab doesn't require docker, it just supports it
[01:17:07] <GreenJello> github CI is important because the vast majority of open source is on GitHub, and the CI is enabled by a file existing in your repo, which is low barrier to entry
[01:17:38] <GreenJello> or "github actions" as it's branded
[01:17:48] <jaawerth> anyway, I like gitlab better but the all-the-things-on-github effect is self-reinforcing so I still use gh a lot
[01:17:51] <qswz> on gitlab you just have to push a .gitlab-ci.yml as well
[01:18:23] <qswz> I'd have to learn github actions
[01:18:53] <bambanxx> qswz is more easy than github?
[01:19:07] <GreenJello> yeah, I mean compared to the previous standards of Travis and Circle that required external accounts and going to other sites to enable it for a repo, and giving access to private repos to a third party company
[01:19:12] <qswz> gitlab is more easy than github?
[01:19:22] <qswz> for CI you mean, I think it's equal
[01:19:35] <qswz> not a problem there I mean
[01:19:55] <GreenJello> github actions is only meh in actual quality; it's just the bundling effect
[01:19:57] <jaawerth> yeah the ease is pretty comparable, IMO. last I checked gitlab had a lot more features in theirs (this may have changed), but you don't need to go that deep until you need to, and the docs are very good
[01:20:02] <GreenJello> haven't tried gitlab CI

[01:54:52] <sheetjs> "outdated" if the software solved and continues to solve a problem, being outdated is meaningless

[01:58:37] <jaawerth> !programming sucks @wroathe
[01:58:37] <jellobot> wroathe, https://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks
[01:58:41] <GreenJello> also, it's far easier to write code than to read it
[01:58:53] <GreenJello> if the AI generates it, you're then doing code review
[01:59:03] <sheetjs> its attacking the wrong level
[01:59:04] <GreenJello> to see if it screwed up
[01:59:15] <qswz> it's also easier to write code than to reduce code
[01:59:21] <GreenJello> yeah, an AI linter could be good
[02:00:02] <wroathe> jaawerth: TBH I can already tell that this article is going to trigger me, and so I'm not going to read it
[02:00:03] <GreenJello> or generating useful test cases
[02:00:12] <wroathe> jaawerth: I'm old enough now to know when ignorance is bliss.
[02:00:13] <GreenJello> (since people tend to be really bad at that)
[02:00:15] <sheetjs> tfw you try to write code and the AI suggests code you wrote years ago
[02:00:19] <qswz> oh yea, unit-tests is moslty copy paste for me
[02:00:34] <qswz> copying the closest unit-tests and replacing a few stuff haha
[02:00:39] <qswz> sadly
[02:00:54] <GreenJello> I mean specifically generating inputs that are likely to behave poorly
[02:00:58] <Alexendoo> One of the examples was it generating unit tests at least
[02:01:04] <GreenJello> where people have a tendency to write tests they expect to pass
[02:01:13] <qswz> GreenJello: thzat's fuzzy-testing
[02:01:42] <qswz> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing
[02:02:06] <wroathe> I don't think I'll ever willingly write a unit test again on the front end now that Playwright and Puppeteer exist and are awesome
[02:02:17] <Alexendoo> but yeah the generated inputs aren't particularly novel
[02:02:27] <GreenJello> similar, but for a fuzz test you need an actual trusted verification function
[02:02:50] <GreenJello> for generating unit tests, it can be as simple as asking the developer if the input and output logically match up
[02:03:04] <GreenJello> so the developer verifies the output

To my knowledge, he hasn't done anything all that controversial recently, but it seems like this particular author is trying to pull a "hit job" and trying to stir up drama over him.

[03:00:04] <qswz> yea this kind of brutal honesty
[03:00:53] <jaawerth> and even if it's equal opportunity, when you're a public figure (which he is in this context), any kind of punching is going to be punching down, so there's a certain responsibility IMO
[03:01:20] <wroathe> That's why I'm going to become a public figure and punch god.
[03:01:26] <jaawerth> but if you ask me whether he has been a net good or bad influence on the world, well, I'd say good because linux and git have had such an (IMO) positive impact. but that doesn't mean he shouldn't communiate more responsibly

[03:04:40] <wroathe> jaawerth: The Linus thing is tricky, because sometimes what people really need is a little tough love. Unlimited patience has the potential to reinforce bad habits when it comes to personal responsibility

[03:06:43] <jaawerth> wroathe: oh I don't disagree. and a lot of the examples in his case I personally have tended to interpret as just him being curmudgeonly, which I sometimes find charming, but it has also delved into the realm of toxicity
[03:06:58] <jaawerth> and it has, at times, alienated people from the project
[03:07:52] <jaawerth> and that kind of thing also tends to have an outsized impact on people who are marginalized in teh tech space - and even from a purely practical, non-moral standpoint I don't think that is good for project health

[03:11:35] <GreenJello> bambanxx, unless there's a typo, the code looks fine

[03:12:16] <wroathe> jaawerth: But that rejects the hypothesis that sometimes people need tough love, because there is a certain class of people who will always feel marginalized by any amount of negativity whatsoever.

[04:46:03] <ash_worksi> So I am re-re-re-watching this video on event sourcing (I can't find very much material online) and the speaker goes over code in javascript (using node I presume)...
[04:46:32] <ash_worksi> he outlines various things throughout his video which I have conveniently copied here: https://gist.github.com/ash-m/669523cfb8be8855e9d313ae66a97c5b
[04:46:55] <ash_worksi> there are a few things I don't get, possibly because I am naive to writing backend processes in javascript
[04:48:11] <wroathe> ash_worksi: I've worked with event sourcing once like 5 years ago. I might be able to answer if I can remember.
[04:48:29] <ash_worksi> he claims that you should perform something along the lines of `if (Account.lastEventNumber !== Stream.lastEventNumber) { /* throw error */ }`
[04:48:52] <ash_worksi> this is the crux, he proclaims, of OCC within an ES system
[04:49:00] <ash_worksi> (my words, not his)
[04:49:56] <ash_worksi> my assumption is that Stream.lastEventNumber is probably retrieved from your store or counted when fetching the events to rebuild your aggregate
[04:50:43] *** Quits: Tobbi (~Tobbi@2a02:8108:1240:48ec:159e:884f:37cc:fb51) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[04:50:54] <ash_worksi> that makes sense to me based on the last codeblock in my paste: { aggregate, lastVersionNumber } = readAggregateFromStream(...)
[04:51:14] <ash_worksi> (he switched from `lastEventNumber` to `lastVersionNumber`, but w/e)
[04:51:35] *** Joins: sed (~sed@pool-100-7-38-116.rcmdva.fios.verizon.net)
[04:51:41] <ash_worksi> anyway, so that makes sense to me so far
[04:52:34] <ash_worksi> when he actually talks about this `!==` check, he kind of phrases in the context of "before you emit your events"
[04:52:51] <ash_worksi> and later you can see in the actual codeblock, he talks about passing it in to emitEvents()
[04:53:44] <ash_worksi> so what confuses me is what exactly `emitEvents()` does? I would think that would be used to do something along the lines of triggering listeners, but that is not how this would work in an event sourced system afaiui
[04:54:05] <ash_worksi> instead, you're just applying the logic of the events
[04:54:21] <ash_worksi> so, he gives the example handler 'UserCreated'

[04:55:56] <ash_worksi> if you were to do something like `user = createUser()` or `user.create()` in terms of DDD, that is where you'd set your credentials and userId, for example
[04:56:15] *** Joins: Donitz (~Donitz@85-156-203-108.elisa-laajakaista.fi)
[04:56:29] <ash_worksi> in an ES system, to my understanding, that would instead just raise a "UserCreated" event
[04:56:43] <ash_worksi> processing that event (applying it) is what would actually be setting your credentials and userId
[04:58:02] <ash_worksi> but when we talk about this lastEventNumber comparison, it sounds to me like that would be something that needs to forbid storing errouneously ordered events
[04:59:39] <ashnur> ash_worksi, you seen Rich Hickey - Are We There Yet?
[05:00:09] <ash_worksi> I wouldn't think that something that is designed to update an in-memory model should have anything to do with persistence, so I can't imagine that's what emitEvents does... but maybe I'm wrong
[05:00:59] <ash_worksi> I am *guessing* emitEvents either (A) stores events (B) applies events or (C) both? ... but I am inclined to think (A)
[05:01:22] <ash_worksi> form all that, do you happen to know what it supposedly does? ashnur wroathe ?
[05:01:26] <ash_worksi> from*
[05:01:32] <ash_worksi> ashnur: I don't think so
[05:01:54] <ash_worksi> ashnur: I'll look it up
[05:02:07] <ashnur> when i did event sourcing, it was also something along the lines of CQRS
[05:02:20] <wroathe> ash_worksi: My memory is foggy, but if I recall correctly the basic idea was to persist the event in the event's table, and then after that you emit it to any interested consumers to build projections of your aggregates
[05:02:42] <ashnur> perception is not action, so any read of any state should be independent of any other read
[05:02:55] <ash_worksi> wroathe: that makes sense; so what I am concerned about is where this `lastEventNumber` check would go
[05:03:02] <ash_worksi> is it a domain invariant?
[05:03:11] <ash_worksi> is it a persistence check?
[05:03:47] *** Joins: sheetjs (~sheetjs@user/sheetjs)
[05:03:49] <wroathe> ash_worksi: That's a detail I'm foggy on. I recall that we had issues with CQRS and event sourcing related to event ordering, because we didn't factor in Javascript's async I/O model
[05:03:55] <ash_worksi> ie `if (model.lastEventNumber !== this.lastEventNumber) {...} else { self.appendToStream(...); }`
[05:04:15] <wroathe> ash_worksi: So we had issues with commands being processed out of ordering, and an inconsistent event stream state
[05:04:29] <ashnur> yeah, i suggest both of you to watch that talk :D https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey/
[05:04:53] <wroathe> ashnur: Saw it a very long time ago. Don't remember it.
[05:05:14] <ashnur> one slide https://imgur.com/a/8OqsNO0
[05:05:28] <ash_worksi> ashnur: unless you're suggesting that invariant is not useful or a flaw, then regardless, I would like to know where it should be applied
[05:05:51] <ash_worksi> anyway
[05:06:09] <ashnur> wroathe, you have to practice it, otherwise the general malaise of A-series thinking just overwhelms everything
[05:06:14] <ash_worksi> from an OOP standpoint I would imagine that it would go inside of an apply function.... that's just how I know everything
[05:06:29] <wroathe> ashnur: Your pointlessly abstract lecture on state is annoying me
[05:06:57] <wroathe> ashnur: If you have a suggestion for ash_worksi, then make it.
[05:07:00] <ash_worksi> I am sure it makes more sense to you in terms of functions rather than classes but I'll just try to say what I know and hopefully that jogs some bells
[05:07:15] <ashnur> wtf
[05:07:43] <ash_worksi> ... anyway
[05:08:48] <ash_worksi> so, say you have a User class, and you build it from an aggregate function, so you get an instance spit out with the (supposedly) current state

[05:09:06] <ash_worksi> the operation is editing the user name
[05:09:50] <ash_worksi> so you call User.changeUsername($newname) or whatever and it raises a UserNameChanged event
[05:09:54] <systemfault> I've done CQRS/ES using TypeScript
[05:11:01] <ash_worksi> so the method would be like: `changeUsername($newname) { $e = new UsernameChanged($newname, self.userId); self.apply($e); }`

[05:13:09] <ash_worksi> systemfault: that's why I'm here; to defer to the FP experts on where that check is supposed to go
[05:13:11] <systemfault> I send a command to a "command bus", that dispatches the command to a related "command handler"... that command handler returns a list of event that are persisted... the those events are published on the event bus
[05:13:13] <wroathe> ash_worksi: To be clear, you're talking about the aggregate here, right?
[05:13:15] <ash_worksi> systemfault: since the exaples are FP
[05:13:21] <ash_worksi> wroathe: yes,
[05:13:48] <wroathe> ash_worksi: The "emit events" part, if I recall correctly, is for what happens after the event is applied to your aggregate: You need to then handle that event for the projections

[05:15:45] <ash_worksi> yes, but what we're talking about is comparing lastEventNumber's to ensure ordering before an event is entered into the stream
[05:16:20] <ash_worksi> in the example, lastVersionNumber (he changed the variable name) is passed to `emitEvents()`

[09:28:53] <setuid> Is there a way to 'reset' an addEventListener? When I use 't' or 'esc' to trigger events, they work the first time when pressed, but don't work again, until I click the body of the webpage, then they work again. What am I missing?
[09:29:57] <setuid> Like I type 't' to run a click() event, which allows me to edit a form field, this works, and 'esc' click()'s the 'Save' button. But immediately hitting 't' again is ignored, can't re-enter that edit context, until I click the webpage, then type 't' again.

I have a list of candidates, and when that list is drawn, I async fetch each candidate's profile page, extract their tags from that page, and pull them back to display them in the list of candidates... which works great. I'd like to see if I can style the individual tags, with a color per-tag, something that gets remembered for 'that' session only (random colors is fine),
[10:25:40] <setuid> but keeping the same color per-tag, on the same page load... so all candidates with 'kubernetes' as a tag, that tag would be say... blue, and 'ubuntu' would be brown. On another page load, those might be different colors, but consistent

[11:44:16] <qswz> !var @ arash
[11:44:16] <jellobot> arash, `var` defines a variable in the current function-level scope, and should not be used when `const` or `let` are available (see !babel, !const, and !let). Always use a keyword to declare variables, otherwise you will pollute the global scope (a keyword is required in strict mode).
[11:45:18] <arash> !let
[11:45:19] <jellobot> arash, The let statement provides a way to associate values with variables within the scope of a block, without affecting the values of like-named variables outside the block. Always prefer it to `var`, but prefer `const` when you don't change the variable binding (which should be most of the time).

[11:46:56] <arash> !const
[11:46:57] <jellobot> arash, When transpiling or on node 6+, always use `const`. If you can't avoid reassigning the variable (try!), use `let`. Never use `var` unless you are relying on !hoisting (which you shouldn't be).

[17:55:31] <Solak> hmm, is it possible in es5 to call the constructor not only to create an instance but to change the values? i.e. f = new MyObject(10); this.MyObject(5);
[17:56:54] <entuland> can't tell if it's possible, but would make for confusing code - better if you centralize the code that deals with such value and explicitly call it in both places (on construction and on alteration of an existing instance)

[18:07:10] <entuland> if that object needs so many different inputs though you may consider refactoring and splitting it into smaller objects with smaller scopes

[19:22:39] <earendel> as stennowork points out: it would be hard to bugtrack this as undefined casts to false. and json is able to have boolean values.

[19:30:25] <stennowork> Lewix, yes, you don't handle any parsing errors, a result of 0 will be false
[19:30:39] <stennowork> debugging the 'await' call _inside_ JSON.parse will be a nightmare
[19:30:46] <earendel> guess it's easier to debug when storing to varriable. but there's nothing wrong about the await part. the casting there is not recommended.
[19:31:32] <aiena> entuland: that looks like what is happening but i don't know what determines the scrollbar length itself to compensate
[19:32:00] <stennowork> JSON.parse(await foo) is terrible

[19:32:49] <earendel> so u only have problems when it shrinks  below 1px :>
[19:33:05] <entuland> yes you may need to subtract the visible height from scrollHeight to have an accurate value

[19:50:06] <entuland> aiena, you can use scrollTop to check the value and see what you actually need: https://i.imgur.com/ZjODV15.png
[19:50:31] <entuland> when you scroll down to the full value of scrollHeight you're technically scrolling more than necessary
[19:50:31] <aiena> i used that but could not figure out what I was missing
[19:50:41] <aiena> I need to read about clientheight
[19:50:53] <entuland> the above is with the scroll exactly halfway through

[19:51:12] <Emil> whereas*
[19:51:37] <Emil> earendel: unfortunately that doesn't help me
[19:51:39] <aiena> entuland: that is what I wanted
[19:51:54] <Emil> and anycase I'm interested in why I had to use the comma operator to get this shit to work
[19:52:18] <ljharb> Emil: because you didn't use the block form of an arrow function
[19:52:18] <Emil> let res=a.reduce((acc, cur)=>(acc[cur.property]=cur), {}); fails but let res=a.reduce((acc, cur)=>(acc[cur.property]=cur, acc), {}); works

[19:53:29] <Emil> it wont work
[19:53:30] <ljharb> Emil: `(acc, cur) => { acc[cur] = 'yolo'; return acc; }`
[19:53:37] <ljharb> Emil: don't return an assignment. split it up.
[19:53:59] <earendel> Emil, you would want to return the aggregated objec, not an empty one. but you do accidently
[19:54:03] <Lewix> stonework: how would you re-write it, I would extract the await from line 5 outside  and put it in a try/catch https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/avzuEWVj/
[19:54:14] <ljharb> Emil: but again, https://npmjs.com/object.entries - reduce for this purpose is obsolete.
[19:54:25] <ljharb> Lewix: use .catch()
[19:54:27] <earendel> as your intention is to pass{} as a secnd argument.
[19:54:42] <ljharb> Lewix: `await getPushEnabledLastTimeState().catch(() => '')` or something
[19:54:56] <Emil> perhaps this is an erroneous view I had, like in C it's entirely customary to do if((x=expression)>10) etc
[19:55:13] <ljharb> Emil: yes, don't do that
[19:55:19] <Emil> so I thought that the result of assignment is is the result

[19:55:21] <Emil> but apparently not?
[19:55:35] <ljharb> Emil: it is the result. but it's not the object.

[19:55:52] <ljharb> Emil: but either way it's horrifically bad code to do that.
[19:55:57] <earendel> Emil: np
[19:56:00] <ljharb> do not conflate assignment with expressions.
[19:56:01] <Emil> ljharb: sssshhh, comma operators are love
[19:56:09] <ljharb> Emil: they're an indicator your code is bad
[19:56:16] <Emil> nah
[19:57:03] <Emil> Anycase, you said that there's fromEntires etc
[19:57:25] <Emil> so if I have dom with some properties and I'd like to collect it into an object
[19:57:28] <Emil> how would you do it?
[19:57:43] <entuland> aiena, it is a bit counterintuitive how you have to compute those values, but the core point is that your 100% is scrollHeight - clientHeight, and scrollTop persists during windows resizes - there is a way to see this behavior as you resize, but it's probably not important (I can elaborate if you are interested though)
[19:58:30] <ljharb> Emil: `Object.fromEntries(Object.entries(object).map(mapper))`
[19:58:51] <Emil> Like an example Array.from(document.body.getElementsByTagName('*')).filter(e=>e.id.length>0).reduce((acc, cur)=>(acc[cur.id]=cur, acc), {});
[19:59:02] <earendel> n>obj={a:1,b:2}; entries=Object.entries(obj); [entries, Object.fromEntries(enries)]
[19:59:04] <jellobot> (fail) ReferenceError: enries is not defined
[19:59:23] <ljharb> earendel: use var/const/let :-)
[19:59:38] <earendel> yw;>
[19:59:51] <ljharb> Emil: `Object.fromEntries(elements.map(x => [x.id, x]))`
[19:59:59] <ljharb> Emil: where `elements` is the array of elements
[20:00:14] <Emil> hmm
[20:00:21] <Emil> sure it's clearer yeah
[20:00:22] <Emil> thanks
[20:00:23] <ljharb> np
[20:00:29] <earendel> n>obj={a:1,b:2}; entries=Object.entries(obj); [entries, Object.fromEntries(entries)] // maybe it really helps. ro retrying.

[20:00:58] <aiena> entuland: I want to know but not now. Yes it is counterintuitive but since the window height itself can keep changing that is an important metric too
[20:01:21] <aiena> So what you wrote makes sense I feel I will play around with those values to get an idea.
[20:01:42] <Emil> earendel: you did say everything right away, I just couldn't see lol :D
[20:01:54] <aiena> Sometimes breaks freshen the mind I will get more confused now I think. I will try to understand.
[20:02:01] <earendel> you're welcome ;)
[20:02:06] <entuland> yep, you'll have to query clientHeight anytime you need to alter that scroll value via JS, aiena - you can't store it as it may change at any time

[20:28:47] <ljharb> dimi1947: but there's nothing wrong with it

[20:46:01] <earendel> for extending objects more safely, you can use Symbols, which practically translate to some rnadom hash on each compile time, while allowing proper names in code.
[20:49:52] <earendel> guess ecma2015 still remains most stable and compliant standard tho.. in curious ways  __proto__ never became standard. sometimes it's better not to provoke the ecma-high-councils ..sturdiness

[23:33:48] <GreenJello> e.g. `if (expression) statement;` is the syntax for an if statement, but the 'statement' can be a block statement containing other statemetns

[23:39:32] <earendel> you need blocks for anything  that isn't an expression. or more than a single expression, or comma separated ones. so the root is that expression vs declaration thingy.
