[00:00:45] <bjs> InPhase: I mean now() definitely returns a local time,  and it has tzinfo=None.  Like I said, the library assumes local time for naive objects
[00:00:57] <bjs> and operations for local time things return naive objects (e.g. now())
[00:01:01] <InPhase> Sounds like something to fix for Python4.
[00:01:25] <bjs> for now() it's not as big a problem because the naive objects interpretation and the actual value of the object align
[00:01:43] <bjs> but utcnow() they're opposed, you have an object you (or at least, the library) interprets as local time but isn't

[02:47:02] <orzel> Hello. I'm far from new to python, but i came accross a class inheritance problem. I use class 'constants'. inherited classes sometimes overrides one or few of them. So far so good it works well. Now i want several subclasses to override the same constants to the same values. I thought about creating a mixin with those constants. This fails because (it seems) (c-)python always use constants from the _first_ class inherited.

[04:22:15] <whatsupdoc> is it possible to reference a value in python?
[04:22:42] <whatsupdoc> I want something like a pointer that points to a value stored somewhere else, so if I change it, that value also changes
[04:22:46] <stealth_> whatsupboy, yes even value is referenced
[04:22:53] <BrenBarn> what do you mean by that
[04:23:13] <BrenBarn> in general most Python variables are like that, but it depends what you mean by "change it"
[04:23:50] *** Quits: jazzy (~jaziz@user/jaziz) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[04:23:55] <BrenBarn> If two references point to the same object, then if you change the object, both refs will see it.  But if you change a reference to point to a different object, then that won't affect other references to the object.
[04:24:36] <BrenBarn> So you can't set up something that "watches" a variable called `a` and be "notified" when you do something like `a = 2`

[06:59:24] <whatsupdoc> [ { }, { }, { }] Doesn't this also preserve ordering since it is 3 separate dictionaries?
[06:59:40] <altendky> But it can't be indexed by key
[07:00:04] <altendky> It's just a bunch of dicts accessible by their location index

[08:52:31] <aphysically> currently mypy (and everything else for that matter) don't do any length tracking at all

[10:32:53] <Jonno_FTW> whatsupdoc: put it in here: https://black.vercel.app/
[10:33:04] <parv> whatsupdoc, I would break the line on "if" & "and"s
[10:34:01] <parv> whatsupdoc, Since that is already in "[ .. ]" there is no need for line continuation character "\"
[10:35:05] <whatsupdoc> Black breaks it up into 5 lines
[10:35:14] <Jonno_FTW> that's what you wanted isn't it?

[14:47:08] <bjs> dminuoso: usually it's pretty much exactly the directory structure.  foo.bar.baz means foo/bar/baz.py,  but the key thing is that Python looks for "foo/" in a set of fixed locations and it's not relative to that file
[14:47:08] <summonner> dminuoso, the current folder is automatically part of the search path when you fire up a python script. so if extras/plugins.py exists...

Im packaging up our netbox fork via poetry, and then essentially just run `daphne ... netbox.asgi:application`. but it turns out, our plugins that have some `from extras.plugin import ....`, where `extras` is a folder inside our netbox repo, are suddenly no longer resolvable
[14:47:59] <bjs> dminuoso: if you share more details we can help explain how the import system was able to import something.  Sadly it depends on the exact directory structure,  what file you ran (and _how_ you ran it...)
[14:48:37] <The-Compiler> rannnn8888: or perhaps consider making your scripts write their PID (process ID) to a file (often called pidfile) so you can find them for killing

[14:49:41] <x4rchimedes> jinsun i see, my problem is, i already have a pandas dataframe, created as described (df = {col1 : x})
[14:49:45] <dminuoso> bjs: Yeah, netbox doesnt assume that someone actually packages it up, installs it via `pip install` or some such, and then just runs daphne..
[14:49:53] <The-Compiler> dminuoso: https://bit.ly/pypackages is a good explanation of this (even if a bit dated)
[14:49:54] <bjs> dminuoso: namely, that the first element on sys.path is always the directory that the entrypoint is in
[14:50:02] <x4rchimedes> jinsun: and I want to append 4000 more columns of data for each row
[14:50:09] <x4rchimedes> jinsun: can that be done?
[14:50:41] <raek> bjs: hmm. does that happen when using "python -m foo.bar" instead of "python foo/bar.py" too?
[14:50:44] <Swayze> 4000 columns :-S

[14:51:15] <Swayze> storing data incolumns instead of rows are we? hhh
[14:51:31] <bjs> raek: yes, except -m is kind of like running from where you are and importing foo.bar
[14:51:39] <dminuoso> bjs: I think summonner described precisely what my problem is. The described method of running/installation all presumes the CWD to be inside that `netbox/` directory, which means `import extras` works right then.
[14:51:58] <jinsun> x4rchimedes:how do you have those extra columns stored now? you have 4000 variables? (I hope not) or is it a dataframe with 4000 columns that you want to append to another dataframe?
[14:52:21] <Kim^J> dminuoso: Why are you running Netbox that way?
[14:52:27] <bjs> raek: so `python3 -m foo.bar.baz` means that the current working directory will be on sys.path,  but python3 foo/bar/baz.py means foo/bar/ will be on sys.path
[14:52:27] <summonner> dminuoso, so finishing the point about you packaging, once you've packaged the app, and it's in site-packages folder, then yes, you'd need to describe the import as  from netbox.extras import plugins

[14:55:49] <dminuoso> As horrible as it is.
[14:55:56] <jinsun> x4rchimedes: well then it is easier, you can just make a dataframe out of that and concat the old and new ones, something like `df = pd.concat([df, pd.DataFrame(array)], axis=1)`

[16:19:34] <Awoobis> Im assuming that thats for brevity and it is actually a list based on their responses
[16:19:36] <Awoobis> yeah

[16:21:19] <Yhg1s> Payam: what does cls.get_components return? A single awaitable, or a list of them?
[16:21:37] <Payam> it returns the json response of a url. and in that json file there is section called "childs:[..]" and in childs there are url that I need to fetch again

[16:22:56] <Yhg1s> Payam: I recommend not trying random things.
[16:23:45] <Yhg1s> Payam: okay, so cls.get_copmonents() is a coroutine. Calling it returns an awaitable. The awaitable yields a list of items. There's only one awaitable, so there's no reason to use asyncio.gather here.
[16:23:45] <Payam> You see what I try to do in the code?

[16:26:05] <Payam> and fetch a list for each of those of URLs in parallel
[16:26:05] <Yhg1s> Payam: okay! So you want to loop over '_mods', and call cls.get_components for each one.
[16:26:10] <Payam> yes
[16:27:14] <Yhg1s> Payam: asyncio.gather(*[cls.get_components(url) for url in _mods]) is probably what you meant to do, then.

[16:33:56] <Awoobis> async writes to the same file is a bad idea (you essentially cant)
[16:34:09] <Awoobis> I'd throw stuff into a queue and have a single function deal with data on the queue
[16:34:32] <Awoobis> (but Im also very spoiled by go and channels so I tend to frame things in that way)
[16:35:04] <Yhg1s> It is also a sensible way to write to a single file from asyncio tasks, or POSIX threads.

[20:04:45] <_Ev> bjs han-solo Thank you!!!
[20:04:51] <bjs> _Ev: also that looks like a weird place to put the print, if it's a template isn't that just going to insert the literal text "print(value['name'])" ?  Normally templating languages have something like {% value["name"] %}
[20:05:13] <_Ev> Practicing with dictionaries, json, and API's. Important skillto have. Thank you, thank you.
[20:05:52] <_Ev> bjs:  The print was just for reference/example for IRC. Using {{ }} for django template engine (html).
[20:06:05] <zava> parv: I will try to remember that :D thanks. Thankfully this was easily fixed. Right now I rarely get to use linux. Maybe during this semester we have a greater need for environemnts. There was a time when I only used linux. Then compatibility and gaming drove me back to windows but I do miss fucking up my .config and then fixing it again.

[23:19:03] <CrtxReavr> So I've worked out a solution for the need to make pip-installed packages globally available on a *nix system, without running pip as root.

[23:19:19] <grym> CrtxReavr:  is it `pipx` and then a careful symlink? :D

[23:20:05] <deniska> sudo easy_install?

[23:25:13] <raek> I have a python process that is built around a single (client) socket. I would like to experiment with using file descriptor inheritance to implement a reload mechanism
[23:26:11] <grym> CrtxReavr: https://pypa.github.io/pipx/docs/  set PIPX_BIN_DIR and PIPX_HOME as required and off you go, multiuser non-root global installs

[23:26:14] <raek> is it possible to mark the socket fs as inheritable, then exec with the same argv, then create a new socket, but re-use the inherited fd?
[23:26:30] <raek> I've found os.set_inheritable() for the first part
[23:27:11] <raek> is socket.socket(fileno=___) the way to go for the post exec part?
