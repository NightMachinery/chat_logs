[01:39:09] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> they're still kept in the database
[01:39:17] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> but I don't know if this is intended or a bug :)
[01:40:05] <FromDiscord> <dom96> it's a bug, we should delete threads that have been deleted permanently after some time
[01:40:17] <FromDiscord> <dom96> the deleted ones definitely shouldn't show up in search though
[01:46:40] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> @dom96 what about storing older edits?
[01:46:43] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> is this intended or not?
[01:47:02] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> like if you have 15 edits on your message, nimforum will send all 15 edits and the frontend will pick the last version
[01:48:50] <FromDiscord> <dom96> the backend should probably only store an edit if it happened after some threshold amount of minutes
[01:49:13] <FromDiscord> <dom96> but yes, sending all the edits is intentional because I was hoping to implement support for viewing these on the frontend

[04:35:31] <FromDiscord> <gcao> sent a long message, see http://ix.io/3Esc
[04:39:05] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> You can kinda think of dynamic libraries as self contained applications that you interact with their exposed APIs, so if something is supposed to throw an exception you need to propagate that it errored through the API
[04:39:25] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> So for instance you might use an `Option` or a `bool` to indicate it failed  and write an error to a buffer
[05:04:42] <FromDiscord> <IsaacPaul> Hmm Interesting..
[05:16:45] <FromDiscord> <gcao> Thanks @ElegantBeef↵Another question: if I define a type in the dynamic library, or create a sub-type like (type D = ref object of A), D won't be recognized by the main program, right?
[05:17:08] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> @gcao the thing with shared libraries is that you're interfacing with them by the C FFI
[05:17:18] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Of course remember dynamic libraries are basically self contained and dont have to be written in Nim
[05:17:21] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> which doesn't know anything like that, it only knows how to call functions and stuff
[05:17:34] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> We use C as an FFI bridge, so you can imagine everything as a C bridge
[05:18:15] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> So when you have a dynamic library the way you interact with it is limited to C basically, you can wrap it to be more idiomatic, or use things like Genny to make it easier to use
[05:19:57] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> So if you have an error in a library you need to bubble it up through the C bridge, which means you either need to try except then return a ptr to the error which both code bases have access to, use enums or bools
[05:20:26] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> This is why many C libraries/apis take pointers and return an int on error, it's universal
[05:24:40] <FromDiscord> <gcao> ok. seems what I'm trying to do is not going to be very successful. I'm writing a toy dynamic language in Nim, but don't want to build all functionality in the main interpreter, and want to allow the user to write libraries in Nim, compile to dynamic library. I was hoping smooth transitioning between the main interpreter and the libraries
[05:25:46] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> With something like that i'd reason you'd want to have user definable op codes, which you then call and the .dll handles it
[05:27:31] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3Esk
[05:27:40] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Which your interpreter calls and uses `initModule` as the entry
[05:28:31] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Then you have all your types that the dynamic libraries need in a module so they can do `import languagetypes` and you can write the op code logic
[05:28:54] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> And of course you can use overloading fo `addOpCode` for specific overloads you support
[05:29:32] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> You might have a `proc(a, b: Reg): (State, someVal)` and the like
[05:30:17] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> and i suppose `initModule` also needs to be able to provide the logic for what calls this op code
[05:31:02] <FromDiscord> <gcao> I'm not using op codes. I create AST of Expression nodes, and allow the Expr to be sub-typed. But the sub-type defined in dynlib won't be known to the main interpreter
[05:31:24] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Ah that subtype is going to be an issue
[05:31:45] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> You need to be able to parse the code and have it know where to call them
[05:33:36] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Hmm with subtypes you need to use runtime information to figure out if they're the same type so i dont pity you 😀
[05:36:46] <FromDiscord> <gcao> Thanks a lot for the information. I'll go back to the whiteboard to see what I do next 🙂
[05:37:32] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> No problem, am interest if you find a soluiton

[06:19:53] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> I see table.values is an iterator, so can't use math's sum do `sum(table.values)` because math's sum doesn't support iterators it seems, so I have to do `sum(toSeq(table.values))` instead.↵I then started readying https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/7299 and it quickly got way over my head. Should I just use the toSeq way?
[06:21:59] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> If you care about memory/performance make a function called sum that takes an `iterable[int or float]` otherwise just use the toseq sum
[06:22:27] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> ok I will use toSeq - thank you!

[06:33:09] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> I guess I look at you though the lens of your elegant code.↵Hey so when you say you had to use a template so it's less fun, what fun thing were you hoping to use instead?
[06:33:26] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> It'd be nice if it could be a proc to hide the details
[06:35:18] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> I don't know what that means, but then again I'm not up to templates yet.↵... and seriously, thank you for your nice examples once again
[06:51:11] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> In reply to @Elegantbeef "Ah right i needs": I see you initialize result and also put result as the last line of the template, I'm guessing that even though proc's don't need that, templates do?
[06:52:53] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Yea templates dont have results
[06:53:38] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> And cause templates are hygenic there is no issue of `result` being aliased
[07:02:17] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> I tried changing it from template to proc, just to see the error, and it seems that proc's don't accept iterables
[07:02:41] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Yea tht's my point 😀
[07:03:27] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> gotcha ok I'm slowly getting there 😉

[14:00:48] <PMunch> Hmm, I have a socket based reader that reads and verifies data (think reading a size field and reading that amount of data, I don't know how much data I need to read until I start reading). I also have an async socket that I read data from. What would be the best way to use this reader proc on the socket?
[14:01:53] <PMunch> Currently I have a try/except thing which tries to read from a string stream, and when that throws an exception it reads 10 bytes into it from the socket.
[14:01:59] <PMunch> But this feels a bit.. dirty

[18:42:15] <FromDiscord> <IsaacPaul> I think if nim wanted me to have this syntax `Type.staticMethod()` it would have first class support.  The more I think about it.
