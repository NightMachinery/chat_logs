[04:08:35] <mathsaey> I'm facing a weird dialyzer issue. I'm calling GenServer.start_link/3 in a file, with no issues. However, when I add `spawn_opt: [message_queue_data: :off_heap]` as an argument to the call, dialyzer complains that my function has no local return.
[04:09:34] <mathsaey> This seems a bit fishy to me, as I'm relying on a documented argument, the call also doesn't error out (so I didn't make a typo afaik). Does anybody know where I should start to fix an issue like this?

[13:50:46] <whk> if i want to cache api responses ( doing about 2K requests in a minute with duplicates ) would Agent be an okay abstraction for a naive solution? 
[13:52:57] <whk> or cachex can work i think. 
[13:53:19] <Nicd> for a naive one, I think yes. Agent is a single process so it will be a bottleneck. you could use ETS (or some caching library that uses ETS inside) to have read/write concurrency
[13:54:42] <Nicd> if you can get quickly up and running with Agent, it may work to enable you to work on other things in the meantime. but I would go with ETS (if single node) to get concurrency since I'm already familiar with it. I think Cachex uses ETS?
[13:56:53] <whk> I think they do. I looked at ETS ( have not used it before ) and not 100% sure how to use it, but will spend some time thanks. We spin up a job, do a bunch of api calls, save and kill the process. 
[13:57:34] <whk> also cautious to add more libraries, so maybe just use ets vanilla.
[13:57:54] <Nicd> ETS API... leaves a lot to be desired
[13:58:06] <Nicd> so a cache library that wraps it can be nicer
[13:58:29] <whk> i see. okay. thanks. 
[13:58:46] <Nicd> lemme find examples for you
[14:00:11] <Nicd> mostly it's two things: the match spec format is at first difficult to read, like `:ets.select_reverse(@table, [{:"$1", [], [:"$$"]}])`
[14:00:32] <Nicd> (there is a library Ex2ms that helps with that)
[14:01:12] <Nicd> the other issue is that when there is an issue, ETS just pretty much tells you "argument error" and with OTP 24 it might even say "argument 2 is wrong" but it doesn't say what's wrong
[14:01:22] <Nicd> that makes it annoying to use when learning
[14:04:31] <whk> Understood, thanks. So let me learn ets without pressure and use a wrapper library for now. Agent can work, but it will require a very naive implementation. 
[14:04:58] *** Quits: ghenry (~ghenry@ghenry.plus.com) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[14:05:00] <Nicd> it's just that Agent is a single process so all cache gets/puts will go through that single process
[14:05:08] <Nicd> it depends on your scale if that is an issue or not
[14:06:12] <whk> yes. for now we run a job per set of api calls, but it might change soon and I prefer not rewriting it if there are better options. 
[14:07:13] <whk> cachex looks pretty well maintained and like it can do the job with little effort.
[14:13:43] <whk> Nicd: thanks for always being so helpful :) I almost feel guilty asking questions.
[14:15:50] <Nicd> don't feel guilty. as long as you keep trying and learning also yourself, it's no issue and in fact normal to ask questions. it's only an issue if people don't do any work themselves.

[18:02:35] <whk> i can't imagine enjoying expiring meatballs :( 
[18:02:44] <Nicd> silly, they're not expired yet
[18:03:02] <Nicd> but they will be soon. if you believe the almighty date on the packaging
[18:07:57] <whk> still doesn't sound like you are looking forward to eating it. packaged meatballs with questionable expiry date. do you eat it with rice? 
[18:08:37] <Nicd> I ate them with pasta and tomato sauce earlier
[18:09:39] <sepow> right-on whk, pho is my favorite soup. Not that I've had a great one outside of Vietnam. I should try to make it myself as well
[18:11:55] <whk> i am working with a team in vietnam atm, so will try to get some hints from them... but guess it is mostly about the quality of the ingredients.
[18:12:57] <sepow> that and a whole lot of fresh herbs 
[18:19:06] <whk> "What do you mean “pho”? " - channel with vietnamese developers. uhm. is it called something else?
[18:19:58] <whk> lol
[18:20:35] <rawtaz> dates are fakes. the real thing is your nose :)

[22:50:35] <sepow> Wait, Pho must be a thing in Vietnam, surely, whk
[22:57:25] <whk> I would have assumed so. The head of engineering for a bank living in Vietnam had to google it. Not sure. I thought it was like asking a South African about biltong. 
[22:59:43] <whk> O wait. I think he did not realise I knew what I was asking, later in the chat: "Oh my god, 99% you will love it "
