[00:01:13] <ButterNoodle> thankfully many of the dog shit motherboard makers have disappeared.. like pcchips and ecs
[00:01:40] <Fenderbassist> oh PC Chips were horrendous, back in the 386 and 486 days
[00:01:47] <ButterNoodle> only because they got ran out of business by the premium makers producing dog shit
[00:02:06] <ButterNoodle> Fenderbassist: my p166 has a pcchips board :|
[00:02:14] <Fenderbassist> my sympathies, my friend
[00:02:18] <ButterNoodle> *it works
[00:02:23] <Fenderbassist> as long as it works
[00:02:27] <Fenderbassist> for MMX land
[00:03:21] <Fenderbassist> running EDO RAM on that board or Fast Page Mode RAM?
[00:03:55] <Fenderbassist> I think my old MMX system had Extended Data Out RAM
[00:04:15] <Fenderbassist> didn't exactly match up to the clock cycles like SDRAM would do, but it worked
[00:04:37] <ButterNoodle> edo
[00:04:44] <Fenderbassist> 66 MHz PCI bus I think
[00:04:45] <ButterNoodle> wait
[00:04:46] <Fenderbassist> cool man
[00:04:57] <ButterNoodle> idk tbh.. I have one p166 and a p233
[00:05:05] <Fenderbassist> you must have hundreds of systems lol
[00:05:16] <Fenderbassist> like my tiny collection wouldn't even make your pile look larger :p
[00:05:26] <ButterNoodle> one has 4x32mb72 pin edo's and the other takes 168 pin or 72 pin
[00:05:34] <ButterNoodle> naw
[00:05:37] <ButterNoodle> I dumped a lot
[00:06:02] <ButterNoodle> probably 8 legacy PCs
[00:06:04] <Bco1981> 128mb in edo ram ?
[00:06:12] <ButterNoodle> handfull of MBs
[00:06:23] <ButterNoodle> and a shit tonne of parts
[00:06:25] <Fenderbassist> the ONLY thing I have more of than you are bass guitars :p
[00:06:29] <ButterNoodle> Bco1981: I think so..
[00:06:34] <ButterNoodle> :)
[00:06:45] <Fenderbassist> yeah that would be about the max on many of those boards
[00:06:54] <Bco1981> 32mb sticks ? that existed ?
[00:07:04] <ButterNoodle> those were coveted sticks
[00:07:08] <Fenderbassist> sure, they were expensive as hell
[00:07:15] <Fenderbassist> the ECC ones even more so
[00:07:21] <ButterNoodle> I waited for a few boxes to be scrapped at a place I worked to snag those
[00:07:33] <Fenderbassist> but back then you were talking about systems costing $2k-$3k
[00:07:57] <MootPoot> eepc
[00:08:00] <Bco1981> hm, i only have 16mb sticks, because the systems that use it could only have 64mb ram in total.
[00:08:04] <MootPoot> but yes
[00:08:11] <MootPoot> amigo would crucify me for this
[00:08:18] <MootPoot> but some people need to really spend more on their computers
[00:08:19] <MootPoot> lul
[00:08:19] <Fenderbassist> A Pentium MMX 233 with 128MB EDO RAM, a Quantum Fireball EIDE hard drive and a 4x CD-ROM cost a lot
[00:08:31] <MootPoot> either that or become linux users
[00:08:36] <Fenderbassist> add in a Diamond Stealth 4MB vid card
[00:08:38] <ButterNoodle> well that was a premium system
[00:08:46] <Fenderbassist> indeed
[00:08:49] <Bco1981> and a voodoo card
[00:08:56] <ButterNoodle> I just had my dick beaters on that exact card :)
[00:09:04] <ButterNoodle> no voodoo tho

[00:09:26] <Bco1981> i found 3 in my basement that looks like voodoo1 and 3 that looks like voodoo2
[00:09:27] <Fenderbassist> I had a later Voodoo card, the Voodoo 2 3000
[00:09:34] <ButterNoodle> Nice 
[00:09:36] <Fenderbassist> AGP
[00:09:38] <MootPoot> my first dedicated gpu was I thik
[00:09:55] <MootPoot> a radeon 53xx or something in a samsung laptop
[00:10:01] <MootPoot> back when samsung still made laptops
[00:10:07] <MootPoot> oh wait
[00:10:08] <ButterNoodle> OG geforce 256.. its still in my dual p3 750
[00:10:09] <MootPoot> they still do
[00:12:49] <Fenderbassist> nice
[00:13:02] <MootPoot> ?????
[00:13:06] <MootPoot> Why am I bleeding 
[00:13:08] <Fenderbassist> yeah I loved computer hardware back in the day, and I know it's way better now
[00:13:18] <Fenderbassist> did you bump against something and not realize it cut you?
[00:13:26] <MootPoot> Maybe 
[00:13:28] <Fenderbassist> that happens to me around gym racks sometimes
[00:13:31] <Fenderbassist> machines
[00:13:31] <MootPoot> Ah well
[00:13:34] <Fenderbassist> peck decks, etc.
[00:13:42] <Fenderbassist> rowing machines
[00:13:44] <Macer> Pfft. Dual voodoo3d for me!
[00:13:50] <Macer> With its ribbon cable. 
[00:14:02] <Fenderbassist> the dual 12MB Voodoo cards, they were awesome
[00:14:08] <Bco1981> i have a ribbon cable aswell
[00:14:12] <Fenderbassist> never had one, watched demos on YouTube
[00:14:14] <Macer> They really were when they came out. Lol. 
[00:14:20] <Fenderbassist> innovative
[00:14:27] <Bco1981> but i'm unsure if all 3 of the ones i have are 12mb versions
[00:14:35] <Macer> You know. The gl based Intel cards were actually pretty ok back then too. 
[00:14:45] <Bco1981> need to test when i get my pentium mmx 233
[00:14:46] <Macer> I’m surprised that didnt become more of a thing. 
[00:14:48] <Fenderbassist> yeah the 2D card were solid
[00:15:00] <Fenderbassist> I even had an S3 Technologies 2D card that was good
[00:15:08] <Fenderbassist> for an old 486
[00:15:15] <Macer> Yah. S3 was ok back in the day. Lol. 
[00:15:16] <Fenderbassist> when I still had 486s
[00:15:34] <Bco1981> s3 trio64 and virge
[00:15:36] <Macer> I remember when I got a 1GB hard drive for $300 and thought it was the best. 
[00:15:37] <Fenderbassist> aye
[00:15:44] <Fenderbassist> :D
[00:15:51] <Fenderbassist> Quantum Fireball :)
[00:15:53] <Macer> You aren’t legit unless you had a Bigfoot hard drive too. Lol. 
[00:15:54] <Fenderbassist> I loved that drive
[00:16:06] <Fenderbassist> lol
[00:16:10] * Bco1981 raises hand, had a few.

[00:16:23] <Macer> Omg those things. They weighed like 100 lbs

[00:17:02] <Macer> That always had borked drivers. Lol. They worked better in Linux than windows. 
[00:17:09] <Macer> Back when Linux was newer lol
[00:17:41] <Macer> Isn’t it weird that a pi back the would have been an absolute miracle of technology lol 
[00:18:01] <MootPoot> Is a pi beefier then a PS2?
[00:18:08] <Macer> Hm. I’d have to check. 
[00:18:20] <Macer> I’d say maybe yes. 
[00:18:36] <MootPoot> I hear there was supposed to be a rpi5 but delayed due to silicon shortage 
[00:18:45] <MootPoot> And they just decided to keep making the 4 for now 
[00:18:51] <Macer> there are so many embedded boards nowadays tho. 
[00:18:55] <Bco1981> i think i emulated ps2 on rpi4. i must have because i have ... borrowed a lot of iso's... for it... recently.
[00:19:04] <MootPoot> It's really just the community Macer 
[00:19:14] <Macer> MootPoot: ya. 
[00:19:24] <MootPoot> You can get better stuff for anything but you're solo 
[00:19:38] <Macer> orangepi is probably the next best thing. I have an orangepi+2e and it’s not bad. 
[00:19:45] <Macer> Also depends on what you’re using it for. 
[00:19:58] <Macer> Banana pi was probably the worst I’ve used. 
[00:20:11] <MootPoot> I have a orange pi zero 
[00:20:17] <MootPoot> Or is it orange pi one 
[00:20:28] <MootPoot> Use it as a octoprint server but can't get webcam to work
[00:20:31] <Macer> MootPoot: did you see those multi rpi0 boards?
[00:20:35] <MootPoot> Yeah 
[00:20:37] <Macer> Those are actually pretty neat 
[00:20:48] <MootPoot> Cool, but if it's that large and pricy 
[00:20:52] <MootPoot> Might as well make a pc
[00:20:54] <Macer> I mean I don’t understand why it isn’t the normal thing to do nowadays 
[00:20:57] <MootPoot> Or buy used server 
[00:21:07] <Macer> But more threads. Lol 
[00:21:09] <MootPoot> Macer: it's kind of pointless 
[00:21:22] <MootPoot> 100 bucks gets you a 24 thread xeon server 
[00:21:24] <MootPoot> Surplus 
[00:21:25] <Macer> For that sort of things threads > power for most things. Especially if you can share them. 
[00:21:27] <MootPoot> Why bother 
[00:21:43] <Macer> Easier to scale maybe?
[00:21:58] <Macer> Less heat and electricity. 
[00:22:00] <MootPoot> Just buy another server 
[00:22:05] <Macer> There are a few reasons for it. 
[00:22:13] <MootPoot> The only reason is if you need ARM, or low power 
[00:22:30] <MootPoot> Otherwise for anything else - might as well do a server 
[00:22:50] <Macer> They actually share resources though. And say they come out with a newer version that is faster. Now you can scale upgrades. 
[00:23:01] *** Quits: treble (~treble@user/treble) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[00:23:18] <MootPoot> But why bother? The server destroys it 
[00:23:25] <MootPoot> Even if you can scale resources, sure 
[00:23:28] <MootPoot> Share
[00:23:34] <MootPoot> Amongst one board 
[00:23:40] <Macer> Maybe. Not sure. Someone probably as numbers for price vs power. 
[00:23:48] <Macer> *has
[00:23:48] <MootPoot> You can do that on servers - and also have like 256gb of ECC ram 
[00:24:26] <Bco1981> what server is that ?
[00:24:45] <MootPoot> Most of them 
[00:24:51] <MootPoot> Post like 2011
[00:25:12] <Macer> It’s all owned by someone anyways. 
[00:25:17] <MootPoot> I got a 24 thread xeon server with 24gb of ram for like 75 bucks 
[00:25:22] <Macer> I’m waiting for someone to make some legitimate open hardware. 
[00:26:04] <MootPoot> Speaking of, why aren't there any companies that make smartphones with stock ARM cpus
[00:26:32] <MootPoot> None of this apple or Snapdragon shit
[00:27:41] <MootPoot> Like I get that they are SOCs and not just CPUs
[00:27:50] <MootPoot> But x86 boards have embedded wifi and other modems

[00:56:15] <Bco1981> lol
[00:56:33] <Poeticode> Yeppp completely FOSS snake :D maybe the only downside is that the scripting language selection is a bit odd
[00:56:43] <snake> Poeticode, lisp?
[00:57:04] <Bco1981> i doubt you will find anything in that size. i think you have to DIY that.
[00:57:06] <snake> oh no, not perl
[00:57:12] <snake> ;-;
[00:57:25] <Cryowolf> maybe I could just buy a thin mdf or osb, add some vener or laminate, soften the edges, shape it a bit
[00:58:58] <Cryowolf> add some angles to soften the edges against me,  make the legs be like a 3 sided square that folds out and has a flat surface to stand on the couch without damaging it
[00:59:07] <Poeticode> lmao nah just like their own custom languages snake . GDNative, GDScript, and Visual Scripting. And C# for funsies
[00:59:11] <Cryowolf> but with a surface that has friction so it doesntmove
[00:59:47] <snake> Poeticode, c# is cool, i also see there is community support for javascript
[00:59:51] <snake> "Community-supported languages include Rust, Nim, JavaScript, Haskell, Clojure, Swift, and D."
[01:00:07] <snake> i just realized unreal engine uses c++ and "blue prints" only
[01:00:12] <Poeticode> odayum I'd love to code in Swift. Haskell if I grew some functional balls.
[01:00:13] <snake> not sure why i even have that installed lol
[01:00:21] <snake> ha
[01:00:43] <snake> js is the only one in that list that i find promising, for my own work
[01:00:50] <snake> because im already so used to writing js
[01:01:02] <snake> but yeah i mean i guess i could learn swift. not sure about the others
[01:01:16] <snake> anyways, pretty sure im not gonna get hired cause i blocked mekely on discord LOL
[01:01:25] <snake> and that guy is quiet now
[01:03:28] <Cryowolf> They need to make an anime (thats not deadman wonderland) with a death game taking place in a theme park, where they have to go on "rides" to earn tickets to survive the day. Each ride has a challenge where you risk your life. Sometimes compete to the death with others, sometimes work together. You also buy food for tickets. Buying your freedom is quite expensive, especially when you have to keep buying tickets to live to tomorrow
[01:04:07] <Fenderbassist> snake, you will get hired or not based on your own merits :)
[01:04:17] <Fenderbassist> all I did was copy/paste a coincedence
[01:04:26] <Fenderbassist> hoping to bring people back together
[01:04:38] <Fenderbassist> I'm going to go play Vapors songs on bass
[01:04:44] <snake> what about "separate but equal"
[01:05:05] <snake> enjoy fender

[02:44:35] <MootPoot> I have about 2 months I gues

[02:55:22] <Fenderbassist> if you're not doing something you want to be doing...just keep thinking about doing it...eventually you will
[02:56:28] <S_T_A_N> I mean... In my experience that's not at all how that works 
[02:56:47] <Fenderbassist> different strokes I guess, in my experience it's how I got myself to do stuff
[02:57:05] <Fenderbassist> quitting cigarettes in the 90s, resuming working out after being bed bound, etc. etc. etc.

[02:58:22] <S_T_A_N> Just keep thinking just makes you suffer. Yes suffering can lead to action, but that's not a guarantee 
[02:58:42] <S_T_A_N> The only way to do something... well... is to do it
[02:58:56] <Fenderbassist> I guess it's different for different people...for me, keeping the goal in mind was motivation, not suffering
[02:59:11] <Fenderbassist> sometimes we're "not ready", and then we are
[02:59:13] <MootPoot> Can I get a job within 2 months

[03:02:36] <S_T_A_N> I don't want to be doing anything. But that's not really an option now is it :P
[03:03:00] <Fenderbassist> I was in a band recently and it was a little bit toxic, but I wasn't ready to make a switch...took a bit of time and finally I was ready, made the switch and now am glad I did
[03:03:18] <Fenderbassist> not doing anything, I would get so bored
[03:03:49] <Fenderbassist> but that's just me
[03:03:55] <MootPoot> S_T_A_N: yeah , pretty much
[03:03:56] <Fenderbassist> I don't want to live without music
[03:04:01] <MootPoot> my manager told me just a few hours ago
[03:04:11] <MootPoot> they dont have any open slots for a casual or full time employee right now
[03:04:32] <MootPoot> if I was a student they could keep me longer but no luck - my sutudent status finishes in 2 months
[03:05:15] <S_T_A_N> Don't be loyal to your company. They aren't to you.

[10:15:05] <Nanobot> How to prove the world is flat: Step 1. Travel in one direction. Step 2. Keep traveling in that direction. Step 3. Keep going until you fall off the Earth. Step 4. Dammit, you're back.

[10:15:36] <MootPoot> I have a better solution Nanobot

[10:26:03] <MootPoot> no
[10:26:10] <MootPoot> turips will keep growing
[10:26:12] <MootPoot> just fine
[10:26:27] <DunceCotus> our understanding of turnips will change
[10:26:29] <MootPoot> if anything - the turnips probably knew if the world was flat before 
[10:26:31] <DunceCotus> and I think that will affect the turnips
[10:26:32] <MootPoot> DunceCotus: how so
[10:26:42] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: different model of reality
[10:26:42] <Satin> MootPoot: butterfly effect
[10:26:43] <Satin> and more
[10:26:45] <MootPoot> why will OUR understanding change how a plant behaves
[10:27:02] <Satin> MootPoot: our understanding and interepretion
[10:27:03] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: because we are not separate from nature
[10:27:06] <Satin> of how the plant behaves
[10:27:09] <Satin> changes
[10:27:24] <DunceCotus> nature is constantly changing to challenge our understanding
[10:27:27] <MootPoot> it sounds like you went to the grocery store and put a label on turnips = "Turnips, flat earth edition" but they're still the same turnips from yesterday
[10:27:42] <MootPoot> Satin: will it?
[10:27:45] <Satin> and our understanding is subjective to quite a degree
[10:27:50] <Satin>  /postmodernist moment
[10:27:51] <MootPoot> will they suddenly not be turnips?
[10:27:51] <Satin> MootPoot: yes
[10:28:05] <Satin> MootPoot: i can take you down the rabbit hole
[10:28:07] <MootPoot> will they suddenly not grow or cook the way we've been using them for millenia
[10:28:10] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: if people have been lying about the state of nature then yeah mass recognition of this could change things sigificantly
[10:28:11] <MootPoot> no, no you cant
[10:28:18] <Satin> i can.
[10:28:23] <DunceCotus> but sure we do live in very cynical times
[10:28:25] <MootPoot> I deny your hole , and plug it with a turnip
[10:28:29] <DunceCotus> everyone is tired of it all before 10

[10:29:00] <MootPoot> pedo modernism
[10:29:32] <Satin> meta-modernism is emerging

[10:30:23] <DunceCotus> turnips for a time
[10:30:38] <MootPoot> they are - they behave exactly how yesterdays turnips did

[10:31:09] <MootPoot> DunceCotus:  yesterday =/= a few decades ago
[10:31:24] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: it may be unrecognisable to us
[10:31:28] <DunceCotus> but there would be slight change
[10:31:41] <DunceCotus> im just saying yesterday here because the changes can be significant and abrupt
[10:31:43] <MootPoot> alright - take this 
[10:31:48] <MootPoot> example
[10:31:54] <MootPoot> you are on a boat
[10:31:58] <MootPoot> you see a iceberg
[10:32:10] <MootPoot> roll foreward the next day 
[10:32:28] <MootPoot> you decide to go underwater or send a drone sub or something to check it out
[10:32:41] <MootPoot> you see its acually shaped like a giant dick underwater
[10:32:50] <Satin> "They described the new sensibility—dubbed “metamodernism”—as one that oscillates between aspects of modernism and postmodernism, with artworks and other cultural artifacts swinging between modern/postmodern polarities such as: enthusiasm/irony, hope/melancholy,  naïveté/knowingness, empathy/apathy, unity/plurality, totality/fragmentation, and purity/ambiguity. "
[10:32:56] <MootPoot> now, the iceberg is the same iceberg
[10:33:06] <MootPoot> your own interpetation or understanding changed
[10:33:12] <MootPoot> but that didnt do anything to the iceberg
[10:33:16] <MootPoot> its all in your head
[10:33:23] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: not so
[10:33:27] <MootPoot> the iceberg dosen't give two fucks if you understand it or not
[10:33:35] <DunceCotus> actually...
[10:33:49] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: the reality is being continually produced
[10:34:04] <DunceCotus> how it is being produced is not solely dependant on our understanding
[10:34:17] <MootPoot> your "reality" being produced is just your perspective producing it
[10:34:18] <DunceCotus> but our understanding can affect the production
[10:34:18] <MootPoot> that's it
[10:34:33] <MootPoot> what is this , intro of philosophy
[10:34:35] <DunceCotus> no
[10:34:40] <Satin> intro to dn
[10:34:43] <DunceCotus> I mean consensus reality
[10:35:09] <DunceCotus> that all the sub crew can see the iceberg is a dick down there
[10:35:23] <DunceCotus> however even this consensus regularly breaks down (necessarily)
[10:35:26] <MootPoot> but the actual nature/properties of the iceberg hasent change
[10:35:28] <MootPoot> d
[10:35:29] <MootPoot> at all
[10:35:37] <MootPoot> its just a limited perception which was corrected
[10:35:55] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: but why the dick?
[10:36:14] <MootPoot> because its as dumb as this argument
[10:36:36] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: but I think perspective is always to be corrected
[10:36:48] <MootPoot> sure, yes
[10:36:54] <DunceCotus> I think an iceberg today is not the same as an iceberg yesterday
[10:36:57] <MootPoot> but that is perspective , not properties of a item
[10:37:26] <DunceCotus> and that is not solely due to a change in our perspective but it is a factor in its auto-production
[10:37:37] <DunceCotus> as our understanding is also natures'
[10:37:51] <MootPoot> no, and no 
[10:37:59] <Satin> assumptions that nature and our understanding are melded 
[10:38:06] <MootPoot> our perspective changing in this case has no effect on it
[10:38:08] <MootPoot> the iceberg
[10:38:09] <DunceCotus> its not an assumption, its a Fact
[10:38:33] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: well it might on a quantum level
[10:38:33] <Satin> it's not, our consiciousness does not dictate nature's phenomona
[10:38:43] <DunceCotus> fixing the iceberg into dick state
[10:38:43] <Satin> it certainly affects our processing and comphrension of it
[10:38:43] <MootPoot> if our understanding is also natures - we would already know every plant species and compound and whatever crap
[10:39:03] <MootPoot> but no
[10:39:08] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: no.. because nature doesn't know itself
[10:39:20] <DunceCotus> it requires conscious agents for such concepts
[10:39:28] <Satin> is this some spinoza shit
[10:39:53] <DunceCotus> Spinoza was right
[10:39:57] <MootPoot> if nature dosen't 'know' itself , or is even conscious , then that means what you said earlier - our and natures understanding is mixed
[10:40:00] <MootPoot> is bullshit
[10:40:15] <Satin> "Early in The Ethics Spinoza argues that there is only one substance, which is absolutely infinite, self-caused, and eternal. He calls this substance "God", or "Nature". In fact, he takes these two terms to be synonymous (in the Latin the phrase he uses is "Deus sive Natura")."
[10:40:16] <DunceCotus> oh?
[10:40:25] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: we don't know nature either
[10:40:37] <Satin> anyways i side with MootPoot on this one
[10:40:37] <DunceCotus> we know bits and pieces, or we have models, illusions etc.

[10:58:56] <Cryowolf> being concerned about a vaccine that was rushed to market isn't a strange thing, especially not when it came to things like astra zenica happening. Thinking that the degree of response of the lockdowns and restrictions etc, the "covid pass" and so on is overkill and a cause for concern isn't strange. Worrying that covid is going to kill you, a family member or friend of yours that is in a vulnerable group is normal, or having already had 
[10:58:56] <Cryowolf> it happen and being scared it will happen again. Wanting others to be vaccinated so the overall health safety around yourself is higher is also perfectly normal. Wanting to shut down society and have everyone locked in their home, forcibly vaccinating people and invading their home and person or restricting them to such a deegree they can't even buy food is NOT normal.
[10:58:57] <Cryowolf> Thinking there is a grand conspiracy behind the vaccine is NOT normal. Thinking masks will make everything safe ISN'T true, thinking they don't work at all ISN'T true either. Believing a business doesn't have the right to demand people wear a mask and offer you one, or to shop for you is a divisive thing. There's normal ways to think about a virus that's deadlier than the flu, though not quite a species killer. There's also a normal 
[10:58:57] <Cryowolf> approach to protecting society without destroying it (something many governments seem to have forgotten.) But it seems to be something a lot of people have forgotten and a lot of governments have let fear lead them into a corner that they have a hard time backing out of.

[11:05:07] <Terminus> is wearing a mask whenever you're outside your home or your car really that big of a deal to you? i really don't get why it's a big deal for people.
[11:05:34] <Terminus> Cryowolf: yes but at the same time, lower new case numbers does mean that you can look at less deaths in the future.
[11:05:51] <Cryowolf> if the number of sick being very high but death rate being very low is something that's happening and we're now at the same degree as other cold viruses or the flu. We shouldn't need lockdown measures again
[11:05:55] <MootPoot> on the  internet nobody knows you're a cat
[11:06:03] <MootPoot> except other pussies
[11:06:05] <Cryowolf> we need to move away from a locked down society
[11:06:10] <MootPoot> nah
[11:06:16] <MootPoot> I'm liking this society
[11:06:18] <MootPoot> can we keep it
[11:06:36] <Cryowolf> this society means you'll eventually never get a new tv or computer or phone
[11:06:43] <MootPoot> does it?
[11:07:02] <Terminus> we're pretty much back to normal here. just with masks. except for capacity restrictions in theaters and restaurants i guess.
[11:07:04] * Satin hasn't had an eggnog in 300000 years
[11:07:19] <MootPoot> I've never had eggnogg
[11:07:22] <Satin> Terminus: western obsession with individualism and liberty pays off sometimes
[11:07:23] <MootPoot> and the idea of it
[11:07:24] <Cryowolf> yes, ships aren't  being allowed into port or it's slowed down immensly, factory work is restricted because they can't have the same number of people working, if working at all
[11:07:26] <MootPoot> bleh
[11:07:34] <Satin> Terminus: but it doesn't pay off at times like these
[11:07:39] <Cryowolf> components are becoming more and more scarce
[11:07:54] <Satin> asian countries have a far easier time with getting people to follow common sense mandates like these
[11:08:06] <Terminus> Satin: yep. it's just sad.
[11:08:15] <Satin> but in between disinformation, slow moving governments with confusing mixed messages, and an obsession with individualism and liberty
[11:08:18] <Satin> the US is fucked
[11:08:29] <Satin> not as fucked as it could be but yeah
[11:09:03] <Terminus> and i was really annoyed because we've had a pretty continuous lockdown for 18 months when all i want to do is go out and get take out food in the middle of the night.
[11:09:08] <MootPoot> I doubt the "never" part
[11:09:16] <Satin> Terminus: understandable
[11:09:17] <Cryowolf> The US being about liberty and now having more authoritarian measures than some countries with a lot less liberty, is comical to me
[11:09:20] <MootPoot> I think roll forward 3-5 years
[11:09:24] <Terminus> for a mask though, i'm like. meh. i can do anything i want, just wear a mask. easy.
[11:09:25] <MootPoot> production will have scaled up
[11:10:10] <Satin> Terminus: for sure
[11:11:33] <Cryowolf> I don't want to wear a mask everywhere, I've had to for a long time. Even when just visiting a friend. Cause when I was in chemo I had to protect myself a lot and avoid most of any and all contact. I want to be able to be outside and breathe fresh air. If I'm not in a crowded space or near a bunch of people outside, I don't see why I have to wear a mask. Indoors I see why, because particulates can remain in the air much more stagnate. 
[11:11:33] <Cryowolf> While outside they'll be dispursed quickly
[11:11:34] <DunceCotus> if we can lockdown for a virus surely we can lockdown for a shit system
[11:11:45] <DunceCotus> fix up this mess
[11:12:21] <Cryowolf> outside near a lot of people, I also see why a mask helps
[11:13:07] <Cryowolf> but once this virus has mutated into a much less deadly variant and herd immunity has grown and this virus isn't any deadlier than the regular flu or cold. I don't see the need for masks
[11:13:40] <Cryowolf> maybe if youre sick it's a good thing in general. To help protect others, like is common in Japan for example
[11:15:06] <Satin> maybe in the future we won't need masks
[11:15:08] <Cryowolf> but uh yeah,  there has to be an end to the lockdowns, restrictions etc and the most logical ones for the complete end of it would be when it reaches the same degree of severity as other yearly viruses
[11:15:12] <Satin> we certainly need to, in many high risk areas
[11:15:19] <Terminus> Cryowolf: i do agree with that. if you're 10 feet away from any other person who's not in the same household, no masks is fine.
[11:15:22] <Satin> yeah sometime
[11:15:26] <MootPoot> but also - I think a parts shortage would probably do some good for "disposable" eletronics
[11:15:31] <Cryowolf> not when it's no more deadly than the cold
[11:15:38] * Satin misread that as pants for one second
[11:15:43] <MootPoot> force people to  keep perfectly fine suff still running
[11:16:03] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, I don't want to pay 1000 eeuro for a new graphic card
[11:16:08] <MootPoot> lol
[11:16:10] <MootPoot> you already do
[11:16:11] <Cryowolf> I could never play anything ever again
[11:16:15] <Cryowolf> no I don't
[11:16:23] *** Quits: DunceCotus (~DunceCotu@user/duncecotus) (Quit: Leaving)
[11:16:32] <MootPoot> even without the shortages - with miners
[11:16:38] <Cryowolf> the typical "line" of graphic cards I tend to buy are around 250-350 euro
[11:16:42] <Terminus> but it's just easier from a mass population perspective to require everybody to wear masks rather than list every exception and something slips through because people are shitty at judging things.
[11:16:48] <Cryowolf> nowhere near 1000
[11:16:51] <Satin> Terminus: tru
[11:17:17] <MootPoot> what are you running now Cryowolf 
[11:17:28] <Terminus> i'm still running a gtx 960 lol
[11:17:38] <Cryowolf> Terminus, Swedes have quite a different attitude towards it though, so it's just a difference there
[11:17:42] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, gtx 1060
[11:17:50] <MootPoot> what's wrong with a gtx 1060
[11:18:08] <MootPoot> it can still run basically everything - although not at like 4k 144 sure but
[11:18:19] <Satin> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/GkBu4nit/image.png
[11:18:21] <MootPoot> I still have a gtx 1060 system
[11:18:23] <MootPoot> no problems
[11:18:28] <ImoutoBot> [image/png] 66kB
[11:18:48] <Cryowolf> once a graphic card dips below medium settings for me in the latest games, I begin to consider an upgrade and I see that happening this year
[11:18:56] <Cryowolf> well no
[11:18:58] <Cryowolf> hnext year
[11:19:01] <Cryowolf> 2022
[11:19:11] <Terminus> 1st world problems. 🤣
[11:19:15] <Satin> truly
[11:19:15] <MootPoot> ^
[11:19:30] <MootPoot> I mean - "not being able to play any new games" and "I cant play above medium" are very different things
[11:19:34] <MootPoot> lol
[11:20:02] <Cryowolf> low in some games is a horrible experience, while in others it's not a big deal
[11:20:07] <Satin> true
[11:20:29] <MootPoot> idk man- as long as the game plays and dosen't crash
[11:20:38] <MootPoot> I had intel HD graphics uptill like 2016
[11:20:43] <Cryowolf> I don't agree
[11:20:46] * Satin settings matter to me too
[11:21:05] <Satin> yeah settings can affect gameplay quality a lot.
[11:21:13] <Satin> immersiveness
[11:21:17] <Satin> i can play on low settings if i want
[11:21:17] <MootPoot> well, I'm not suggesting like low settings at 480p
[11:21:23] <Terminus> only new game i've tried that my gpu can't seem to handle anymore is halo infinite. it just crashes. solution for me is simple: don't play halo infinite. don't need to bitch about the fact that i'm still running a gtx 960.
[11:21:48] <MootPoot> if it can do "any preset" at 1080p and achieve more then 30, that's passed the playable ball for me
[11:21:51] <Satin> nice that it works for you
[11:22:05] <Terminus> or it could be because i'm still running win10 20H1. i'm being lazy about backing up my data before i update to 21H2.
[11:22:24] <Abrax> fans of video games here?
[11:22:32] <Abrax> i need to bake a pizza
[11:22:39] <Abrax> too bad i dont got any caffeine
[11:22:43] <Satin> ?
[11:22:54] <MootPoot> I'm kind of making the argumetn against myself here
[11:22:56] <Cryowolf> Terminus, good for you. I respect your decision. Why is mine hard to respect? A graphic card shouldn't cost so much and only be bought by cryptominers that don't use them for graphics at all
[11:23:18] <Cryowolf> all I want is for them to cost around what they did before. Not 3x as much
[11:23:19] <MootPoot> its hard to respect because your decision dosen't get you anywhere
[11:23:29] <MootPoot> its like respecting walking into a wall
[11:23:30] <Satin> nah cryo is right
[11:23:34] <Cryowolf> does it have to get me anywhere?
[11:23:34] *** Joins: Mr_Miser1 (~weechat@27.34.108.216)
[11:23:38] <MootPoot> yes
[11:23:47] <Cryowolf> is wanting to enjoy something such a bad thing?
[11:23:48] <MootPoot> I get that you want gpu's to go back to normal prices
[11:23:55] <MootPoot> I'm fine with  that
[11:23:59] <Satin> MootPoot: gpu settings matter.
[11:24:03] <Satin> capabilities*
[11:24:06] <MootPoot> ehhh
[11:24:12] <Satin> MootPoot: maybe for your games they don't
[11:24:26] <MootPoot> you're talking do a dude who played through all of far cry 2 at like 10fps
[11:24:34] <Satin> and i'm used to playing on low settings, but i can entirely see why it affects quality of gameplay and enjoyment and immmersivion
[11:24:38] <Satin> MootPoot:...
[11:24:44] <Satin> MootPoot: yeah u don't count 
[11:24:47] <Cryowolf> I have very few things I can do right now to enjoy, one of those is gaming
[11:24:56] <MootPoot> I had to leave a battery on my 'W' key and just sit around + wait
[11:25:00] <Satin> MootPoot: ...
[11:25:02] <MootPoot> to actually get places
[11:25:06] <Cryowolf> and I don't share your opinion, at all
[11:25:10] <MootPoot> I had a 18650 for  that
[11:25:15] <Cryowolf> I cant play the way you do MootPoot
[11:25:18] <MootPoot> perfect weight and size to hold down the W
[11:25:21] <Satin> MootPoot: basically in other words, you're a huge exception
[11:25:28] <Cryowolf> yeah now you're just bullshitting
[11:25:32] <MootPoot> ...
[11:25:33] <MootPoot> no
[11:25:34] <Satin> most people don't have the patientce for low games
[11:25:41] <Satin> i don't think he's bullshitting lol
[11:25:43] <MootPoot> this is something I actually did
[11:25:45] <Satin> i had a very ghetto setup
[11:25:47] <Satin> when i was younger aswell
[11:26:00] <Satin> when my charging port broke i actually used a piece of wire to hold stuff together
[11:26:03] <MootPoot> I had a 18650 lipo from a broken power bank
[11:26:04] <Satin> intel HD graphics moment too
[11:26:06] <MootPoot> I used that
[11:26:12] <MootPoot> Satin: lmao I know
[11:26:14] <MootPoot> that feels
[11:26:18] <Satin> lololo
[11:26:18] <Cryowolf> I want to be able to play games, I want to afford a new graphic card later this year or in 2023
[11:26:28] <Satin> Cryowolf: good luck, hope you get that
[11:26:32] <Cryowolf> before I might be dead
[11:26:33] <beaky> intel hd is enough for h games
[11:26:42] <Satin> pre
[11:26:43] <Satin> perv
[11:26:48] <MootPoot> I hope you get it too Cryowolf 
[11:27:12] <Cryowolf> later next year even, 2022...I already think of it like 2022
[11:27:12] <MootPoot> but the only part I'm against here is the "oh no I cant play ANYTHING ( since I dont want to play on lower then medium ), I can NEVER game again"

[11:27:22] <MootPoot> like there are so many ways now

[11:28:22] <MootPoot> lol
[11:28:48] <MootPoot> but take it from a guy who's been on both sides - literal shoebox computer at 10fps 
[11:28:58] <MootPoot> and who now runs a rtx 3080 with a 4k 144hz monitor
[11:29:06] <beaky> 4k 144hz vtuber
[11:29:13] <MootPoot> its not that big of a deal that you  cant play on med or higher
[11:29:27] <Cryowolf> GF Now works for some games, works great for some games. I'd rather have m y own graphic ard
[11:29:45] <MootPoot> congrats - now see how that is different from "I can never play a game again"
[11:29:45] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, that's a very egocentric way of looking at things
[11:30:01] <MootPoot> of course it is , I only have my own perspective to experience things though
[11:30:14] <MootPoot> if anything yours is also egocentric
[11:30:22] <MootPoot> not that there is anything wrong with that
[11:30:24] * Satin slaps MootPoot around for making a mountain out of a literal molehill
[11:30:35] * MootPoot licks Satin 
[11:30:38] <Cryowolf> that doesn't mean you can't be introspective and look at different perspectives and wants and needs
[11:30:48] <Satin> Cryowolf: he's being silly
[11:30:52] <Satin> gl getting your card
[11:30:56] <MootPoot> ^
[11:30:58] <Satin> and enjoying ur games
[11:31:08] <MootPoot> well, I'm being partially silly
[11:31:14] <Satin> MootPoot: you need to be silly with the right people
[11:31:15] <MootPoot> you can have whatever standards you want
[11:31:18] <MootPoot> I'm okay with it
[11:31:20] <Satin> you'll aggrevate people upointleslssly
[11:31:26] <Satin> MootPoot: troll me instead plz
[11:31:29] <Satin> jk
[11:31:31] <MootPoot> I just think the "oh no medium or higher" is a bit spoiled
[11:31:36] <MootPoot> but you do you
[11:31:43] <Satin> MootPoot: it's just so unnecessary to push the point though
[11:31:44] <Cryowolf> sure but Im not gonna pay 800 euro for whats normally be a budget card but is now bought by cryptominers instead of gamers
[11:31:50] <MootPoot> Satin:  I know
[11:31:55] <MootPoot> I'll troll you instead, love
[11:31:59] <Satin> MootPoot: all you're doing is aggregavting cryo
[11:32:02] <Satin> yneah
[11:32:04] <Satin> no
[11:32:06] <Satin> i mean no*
[11:32:09] <MootPoot> Satin: did you look into that book
[11:32:12] <MootPoot> I linked you
[11:32:14] <MootPoot> the math one
[11:32:19] <MootPoot> you'll like it
[11:32:21] <Satin> MootPoot: i clicked on it but i didn't rly check it out no
[11:32:26] <MootPoot> :(
[11:32:28] <Satin> explain what it's like
[11:32:29] <MootPoot> want me to send you a pic
[11:32:31] <Satin> sure
[11:32:32] <MootPoot> of a few pages
[11:32:42] <MootPoot> its much better then what I can explain
[11:33:41] <Cryowolf> nah some games playing on low is like watching a horror show cause the games textures were horribly optimized which is unfortunately the case a lot these days. I wish game devs had the time to make more efficiently run games, rather than rush them out and then push out another generation of graphic cards to compensate
[11:34:06] <Satin> Cryowolf: true
[11:34:20] <Cryowolf> and now cryptominer have taken graphic cards =/ Which is just a shit thing
[11:34:31] <Cryowolf> I hope the cryptomarket crashes
[11:34:42] <Satin> lmao
[11:34:56] <Cryowolf> or another company makes pure "mining cards" so they dont need to buy gpus, and gpus become less efficient at mining
[11:36:22] <MootPoot> Rip ircloud database down
[11:36:34] <Cryowolf> since crypto isnt recognized as currency though, if a government agency seizes it (steals it), that wouldn't be them stealing money or anything like that and if they made a law that allows for it, would be both horrible and funny

[11:37:39] <Cryowolf> gaming is one of those things

[11:37:56] <Cryowolf> wanting to have a good experience from it shouldn't seem strange
[11:37:56] <MootPoot> idk just donwnload and rotate locally

[11:38:27] <beaky> iroha is kawaii
[11:38:28] <MootPoot> I never said "wanting to have a good experience is bad/spoiled"
[11:38:57] * Satin will never understand why some ppl unnecessary go on down doomed arguments
[11:38:59] <Cryowolf> you indirectly did though, given that medium+ would be my good experience :p
[11:39:17] <MootPoot> no,  the medium is gaming
[11:39:21] <Cryowolf> but yeh that's not my issue anyway
[11:39:22] <MootPoot> the level of experience is seperate
[11:39:31] <MootPoot> anyway Satin  read and tell me what you think
[11:39:33] <Cryowolf> my issue is just with the pricing
[11:39:39] <beaky> eikaiwa witha cute girl
[11:39:39] <MootPoot> I got dragged back into there for a second
[11:39:44] <Cryowolf> the pricing is ridiculous right now
[11:39:54] <Cryowolf> and it's affecting more and more things
[11:40:28] <Cryowolf> I cant wait until a vacuum machine costs 500 euro for one that used to be 60 euro ;D
[11:40:40] <Cryowolf> maybe cryptominers will find a way to use those too
[11:40:56] <MootPoot> lol
[11:41:04] <MootPoot> I highly doubt it'll ever get that bad
[11:41:09] <Cryowolf> me too
[11:41:10] <MootPoot> a bit of the doomer mentality there
[11:41:14] <Cryowolf> I'm being fascetious
[11:41:42] <MootPoot> hungry
[11:41:45] <Cryowolf> no it's a fascetious mentality!
[11:41:49] <Cryowolf> totally different

[11:42:12] <Satin> but ill try to read later
[11:42:15] <MootPoot> ok
[11:42:23] <MootPoot> yeah it needs mental juice to read
[11:42:25] <Cryowolf> I don't actually think it will get that bad. Cause before we reach that point there would be an ecoomical depression rivaling or surpassing the 1930s one
[11:42:33] <MootPoot> but basically it just works like this format

[11:45:12] <Satin> ah
[11:45:31] * MootPoot has a resources folder too where he hides all his stuff
[11:45:32] <MootPoot> hehe
[11:45:41] <Cryowolf> that reminds me of something Ive been thinking of for awhile. That there should be more proficiency tests to take because of the degree of autodidactism that exists now thanks to the internet
[11:45:50] <MootPoot> yes and no
[11:46:03] <MootPoot> there are much more self learners, I agree
[11:46:26] <MootPoot> however...those self learners  dont really gear their learning towards getting good test scores
[11:46:42] <MootPoot> in fact if I had to take a test for stuff I wanted to learn on my own, I probably wouldn't bother learning it
[11:46:47] <Cryowolf> rather thn having to study theoretical background stuff for years to be allowed into a university course, when they already have the knowledge
[11:47:03] <MootPoot> oh , you mean like early access into uni kind of deal
[11:47:05] <MootPoot> challenge exams
[11:47:10] <MootPoot> sure, I guess for that
[11:47:30] <Cryowolf> yes, rather than having to study for years simply because they said so
[11:47:35] <Cryowolf> to learn something you already know
[11:47:45] <MootPoot> I thought you meant like "wanna learn C# and be able to say you know C#! you have to take a exam to prove it!"
[11:47:53] <Cryowolf> having to study for years since thats the only way to take an exam test
[11:48:16] <MootPoot> I would have skipped middle school if I did that
[11:48:17] <MootPoot> lol
[11:48:23] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, nah cause if you know it well enough these days you can just prove that on a CV and they will take that over a degree
[11:48:27] <Cryowolf> in a lot of cases
[11:48:46] <Cryowolf> cause you demonstrate knowledge and experience rather than "Oh I just finished school"
[11:49:09] <Cryowolf> youd also demonstrate a capacity for self-learning and growth which would be beneficial for the company
[11:49:46] <MootPoot> depends on the field really
[11:49:59] <MootPoot> not with anything applied
[11:49:59] <jessedesu_onaph> I'm werkin

[11:50:36] <MootPoot> would you want a lawyer or a doctor who never did their practicum or internship?
[11:50:36] <jessedesu_onaph> Ah
[11:50:53] <Satin> Ah~
[11:50:55] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, no but you just mentioned C#
[11:51:01] <MootPoot> ah
[11:51:03] <Cryowolf> so I responded to that

[11:53:46] <jessedesu_onaph> Satin
[11:53:51] <Cryowolf> Doesn't matter how you came to know how to program, if you know how to you'll accomplish the same thing. If you've learned it on your own and been practicing it for awhile you also have working experience. You've also presented an ability for self-learning, which tells them you can learn new things and adapt as the market changes. While someone just out of school only knows what they learned about those languages
[11:53:53] <jessedesu_onaph> Can I have a hug
[11:54:06] <Cryowolf> with no working experience, or applieid experience
[11:54:12] <MootPoot> hmm
[11:54:22] <MootPoot> schools here do give you applied experied
[11:54:30] <MootPoot> expeirience in your capstone projects
[11:54:43] <MootPoot> but also - self learning has downsides, in that its self-directed
[11:54:43] <Cryowolf> now with a doctor or something in health etc. You better have a degree
[11:54:50] <Cryowolf> I dont want a self-taught surgeon
[11:54:56] <Cryowolf> operating on me
[11:54:58] <MootPoot> your knowledge is a bit limited - you can only learn what you know exists
[11:55:06] * Satin sends jessedesu_onaph an internet hug
[11:55:18] <Cryowolf> thats why audodidactism is a rarity, now something everyone possesses
[11:55:22] <Satin> jessedesu_onaph: how was your day?
[11:55:31] <MootPoot> for example, self taught programmers ignore best practices, design methodologies, testing, etc etc
[11:55:32] <Cryowolf> it's the ability to be your own teacher and seek out that knowledge
[11:55:34] <MootPoot> like some do learn
[11:55:47] <MootPoot> but most "self-taught" are sorely lacking in one or more areas
[11:55:50] <MootPoot> of thier education
[11:55:55] <Cryowolf> very different from just being self-taught
[11:56:07] <MootPoot> I'm okay with your challenge exam idea
[11:56:13] <jessedesu_onaph> Ty satin
[11:56:17] <MootPoot> but I still think a degree has worth
[11:56:19] <Satin>  ^^
[11:56:37] <jessedesu_onaph> I'm stressed
[11:56:38] <Cryowolf> if you're an autodidact, you can learn the same way you could through a university. With some field exception
[11:56:43] <jessedesu_onaph> Peak season
[11:57:09] <MootPoot> Cryowolf: what if you just dont realize how important your missed topics are, or you missed stuff etc
[11:57:29] <Abrax> so wasup
[11:57:34] <Cryowolf> but thats what Im saying an autodidact is capable of discerning
[11:57:47] <Abrax> i do like slime
[11:57:50] <Abrax> fun show
[11:57:56] <Cryowolf> they will seek out and look at it from the perspective of a teacher, who will teach themself
[11:57:58] <MootPoot> capable does not mean they will in my experience
[11:58:28] <Cryowolf> thats why autodidatism is rare, because it's not the same as self-learning. It's different
[11:58:33] <MootPoot> many autodiadacts learn what gets them where they want to go the fastst, then have a hard time later due to their missing foundation
[11:58:33] <MootPoot> hmm
[11:58:41] <MootPoot> I guess if you're seperating it out like that sure
[11:58:54] <jessedesu_onaph> Autodittytitties
[11:59:09] <MootPoot> although afaik autodiadact does pretty much directly mean "self learning"
[11:59:14] <Cryowolf> but if someone learns the short cut, that's an issue of discipline (or lack of) and knowing you skipped
[11:59:16] <MootPoot> with no added context like you are adding

[11:59:56] <MootPoot> "self-taught"
[12:00:06] <jessedesu_onaph> What do you call it when you need to eat but you aren't hungry
[12:00:11] <Cryowolf> yeah, thats the most easy way of putting it
[12:00:20] <Cryowolf> but there's ways of approaching self-learning.
[12:00:32] <Cryowolf> Being your own teacher or being taught
[12:00:54] <Cryowolf> being your own teacher like putting together your own study program and tests etc
[12:01:14] <MootPoot> I think it all falls under the same word
[12:01:17] <Cryowolf> as opposed to just googling and reading and having learned
[12:01:26] <MootPoot> just a specturm of how well executed your self-learning is
[12:01:43] <Cryowolf> if it does, then I suppose I mean the best of those
[12:01:57] <Cryowolf> there's the googler and there's the teacher
[12:02:07] <jessedesu_onaph> College is self learning with beer and parties
[12:02:27] <Abrax> its cheaper to self learn without college
[12:02:27] <Cryowolf> nah College is directed learning
[12:02:28] <MootPoot> Abrax: ?
[12:02:31] <Abrax> and just utilize the internet
[12:02:39] <Cryowolf> they point you towards the knowledge etc
[12:02:46] <Cryowolf> with the occasional test or class
[12:02:54] <Abrax> but the tests suck
[12:02:57] <Abrax> nobody likes tests
[12:04:04] <jessedesu_onaph> I'm sad when I eat

[12:14:32] <Cryowolf> You can learn engineering by yourself, the biggest reason you don't is quite "practical" in that you dont have access to, or the money to buy the components you need to take the engineering to the next level
[12:14:40] <Cryowolf> a school does
[12:15:07] <Cryowolf> I think it requires some innate talent though
[12:15:09] <MootPoot> or the knowlege , or tha ability to do actual projects ( more then tinkering )

[18:12:28] <isekaijin> Since this is the anime channel, here's a computer question.
[18:12:34] <isekaijin> Is it possible to install Windows 11 from an installation medium mounted on *another* computer?
[18:13:02] <isekaijin> My only USB stick is broken, so I cannot dd the ISO into it.
[18:16:31] <Sadale> buy another USB pendrive lulz
[18:16:44] <HubertFarnsworth> does windows has option to net install?
[18:17:31] <Cryowolf> net install?
[18:17:45] <Cryowolf> No, I wouldnt think so since it has to reboot and stuff
[18:17:46] <ButterNoodle> yea
[18:17:53] <Cryowolf> or what?
[18:18:09] <Cryowolf> it does? or the iso file you mean?
[18:18:11] <ButterNoodle> not boot/run, just install right?
[18:18:22] <HeTo> it’s pretty easy to net install Windows if you get Windows PE booted. however in this case the bigger problem is going to be booting
[18:18:45] <ButterNoodle> or do you mean like a debian netinstall image
[18:19:03] <ButterNoodle> where it bootstraps and pulls the rest of the os from the web
[18:19:23] <HubertFarnsworth> I mean like debian netinstall image
[18:19:29] <ButterNoodle> no
[18:19:41] <ButterNoodle> not that I am aware of..
[18:19:56] <Jigsy> Sure is windy outside...
[18:20:00] <HubertFarnsworth> it's handy though
[18:20:05] <HeTo> not from the web but if you can set up an SMB server that can share the files, it is possible
[18:20:07] <ButterNoodle> whose windy?
[18:20:09] <ButterNoodle> is she cute?
[18:20:24] <HubertFarnsworth> ButterNoodle: she's the cousin of rainy
[18:20:26] <Jigsy> Don't see any damage, though.
[18:20:34] <HubertFarnsworth> and sister of autumn
[18:20:35] <ButterNoodle> *I'll take both
[18:20:47] <ButterNoodle> O/ all 3
[18:20:51] <HeTo> you just need to boot Windows PE somehow (a smaller USB stick will do), get to the command prompt, net use the directory from the server that has the files, then start setup.exe from there
[18:21:46] <ButterNoodle> reading between the lines.. I think HubertFarnsworth is trying to reinstall without media
[18:22:24] <HeTo> yeah and that’s the bigger problem
[18:22:32] <HeTo> as it would be with netinstalling Debian too
[18:22:53] <HeTo> as for booting Windows PE off the local network, it’s probably still possible, maybe not even that hard, to do if you have a Windows Server machine and can set up a remote installation server, but if you haven’t got one, it’ll get harder
[18:23:12] <HubertFarnsworth> that is fun though ButterNoodle, isn't it?
[18:23:35] <HeTo> back in the BIOS + PXE days I did that with pxelinux and memdisk, loading a Windows PE ISO image to memory and then booting that
[18:24:02] <HeTo> something like that is probably still possible with UEFI and net booting, but I’ve never looked into how you would do that
[18:24:03] <HubertFarnsworth> I haven't done net install in a decade but I remember it being like compact mini os with just the essentials, no gui or any fancy shit
[18:24:05] <ButterNoodle> yeap
[18:24:13] <ButterNoodle> pxe boot
[18:24:30] <ButterNoodle> I was running arch from pxeboot
[18:24:35] <ButterNoodle> some years ago
[18:24:42] <HubertFarnsworth> nice
[18:24:54] <ButterNoodle> windows just wants you to click next
[18:25:02] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah
[18:25:26] <HubertFarnsworth> even debian is same now these days ButterNoodle 
[18:25:33] <HubertFarnsworth> times have changed
[18:26:40] <HubertFarnsworth> ButterNoodle: I remembered another crazy manga which I forgot to mention to you, dead tube
[18:26:59] <ButterNoodle> oh, I think that is in my list
[18:27:21] <HubertFarnsworth> I have only read a couple of chapters, it's super gore, sex crazy shit
[18:27:38] <ButterNoodle> woof
[18:28:10] <HubertFarnsworth> I don't think anyone could read it though
[18:28:21] <HubertFarnsworth> it's seriously pushes the boundaries 
[18:28:50] <Cryowolf> dead tube?

[20:30:25] <MootPoot> rather then randos
[20:30:31] <MootPoot> who happen to look nice
[20:30:36] <Satin> randoms literally are looking at these people
[20:30:39] <Satin> and in their circles do that

[20:31:55] <Satin> it's cringe because it's not making them money

[21:16:16] <MootPoot>  the winner is who lived the happiest life
[21:17:45] <Satin> i won't live the happiest life
[21:17:55] <Satin> happiness is not a goal for me
[21:17:57] <HubertFarnsworth> I’d say winner is someone who lived doing what he wants.
[21:18:18] <Satin> even when i feel sensations of happiness it's  never permanant and i'm fine with that
[21:18:29] <MootPoot> copium
[21:18:32] <HubertFarnsworth> There’s no such thing as happiest life. Happiness is ephemeral.
[21:18:52] <Satin> it's not coping to accept that happiness isn't a goal for everyone or something everyone can experience constantly
[21:19:03] <Satin> in fact I personally find far more value in a neitzchean type of suffering
[21:19:09] <HubertFarnsworth> Yeah Satin, we always return to baseline of being normal.
[21:19:12] <MootPoot> ne....neiz
[21:19:19] <MootPoot> nutzclean?
[21:19:25] <Satin> and what even is "happiness" to most people, hedonism? hopefully not
[21:19:35] <MootPoot> nonstop pounding
[21:19:55] <MootPoot> or , well
[21:20:02] <MootPoot> I guess I dont mean happy as in happy
[21:20:12] <MootPoot> you can swap that for satisfying 
[21:20:34] <MootPoot> the implication being is if you achieve your goals , you will be satisfied, and thus happy
[21:20:37] <Satin> for sure, for some people
[21:20:47] <HubertFarnsworth> For most people they assign happiness to external things like getting married, buying a house, job and such but eventually they will feel empty later if they think it’s gonna make them happy.
[21:21:02] <HubertFarnsworth> It does but only for couple of days
[21:21:05] <Satin> I don't feel the same way for sure, half the time I don't have rigid goals, and I've never felt strong satifscation when i reach a certain thing
[21:21:05] <Satin> yeah
[21:21:12] <MootPoot> well, thats teh thing
[21:21:18] <MootPoot> happiness is a temporary state
[21:21:24] <Satin> I mean I do have goals, and I do feel satisfaction but it's not some central part of my life that drives my existence or anything
[21:21:34] <MootPoot> the real goal is to have a steady foundation of satisfaction to exist on
[21:21:36] <MootPoot> I guess
[21:21:37] <Satin> when i think about it more, it all feels finicky
[21:21:42] <Satin> to hyperfocus on goals
[21:21:43] <MootPoot> finick

[21:37:11] <Urchin[emacs]> I know Microsoft made it's own Linux distro to handle internal networking, because they were sick of paying for proprietary solutions
[21:37:19] <Satin> but it's being ripped away from
[21:37:31] <Satin> all the ideals that the free software/and to an extent the open source movement had
[21:37:36] *** Parts: Tomorrow (~Heart256@pool-100-36-116-45.washdc.fios.verizon.net) (Leaving)
[21:37:38] <Satin> it's being fucking co-opted dude
[21:38:26] <MootPoot> I disagree- I dont think open source software for mainstream home desktop would have ever gotten popular without the help of a company
[21:38:41] <Satin> that is not the point.
[21:38:43] <MootPoot> No rando wants to learn terminal to jerk off to porn
[21:38:58] <MootPoot> I know the ideals are different
[21:39:12] <MootPoot> like you said - that was the price to go mainstream
[21:39:13] <Satin> The point isn't at all about if a company helped it or not. The point is that company is using the open source model and the work done by open source contributers to its explicit benefit.
[21:39:27] <Satin> And, in the process, throwing away and extinghuising the ideals involved.
[21:39:42] <Satin> This is not an instance of Microsoft simply taking some linux lirbary or framework and intergrating it into their products.
[21:39:59] <Satin> No, it's the entire ecosystem from it and other big tech firms, it's linux itself being intergrated and used. 
[21:40:53] <Satin> who cleverly have ways to exploit the open source model to their benefit but when it comes to actually implementing design that follows user-freedom principles or does things like respect privacy, and not work against the people actually using the software, etc, no
[21:40:54] <MootPoot> the double edged sword of OSS
[21:41:17] <Satin> Many people in the open source community are okay with this to be clear. But many others are not.
[21:41:33] <Satin> You might not know this Poot, but ages ago, a split emerged
[21:41:37] * MootPoot pats Satin 
[21:43:09] <Satin> wow
[21:43:12] <Satin> all my messages didn't get sent
[21:43:14] <Satin> anyways
[21:43:46] <Satin> So on one side, the "free software/libre" camp emerged led by Richard Stallman who insisted on no integration with proprietary software at all.
[21:44:29] <Satin> Stallman's insistence on things being "free" (in the libre sense) is fairly radical to most people, and extends all the way right down to the hardware as much as possible
[21:44:31] <Satin> https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.en.html

[21:44:59] <Satin> these are distributions which have no properitary blobs,r ight down to the damm say, nvidia graphics blob not being there because of that
[21:45:13] <MootPoot> free hardware is gonna be hard boss
[21:45:14] <Satin> on the other side, were the "open source" camp 
[21:45:27] <Satin> (free as in freedom, not free beer remember)
[21:45:33] <MootPoot> has anyone really made a affordable open source computer
[21:45:35] <MootPoot> I know
[21:45:39] <Satin> on the other side were the "Open source Incentive"
[21:45:50] <MootPoot> aside from OpenPower and those raptor computing guys auroroa keeps simping for
[21:45:51] <Satin> that were willing to work and intergrate with propeitary companies
[21:46:03] <Satin> these include Red Hat and other companies
[21:46:42] <MootPoot> there was RSIC V but auoroa says thats BS
[21:46:59] <MootPoot> so the only hope is if someone makes stock, untouched ARM computers
[21:47:15] <ButterNoodle> ?
[21:47:16] <Satin> that were willing to work with clients and software  intergration that was not open source
[21:47:19] <Satin> Linus Torvalds ultimately leaned towards OSI.

[21:47:30] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: satin is ranting about FOSS and stuff
[21:47:31] <ButterNoodle> where the big pp cpus...
[21:47:41] <Satin> Stallman and the rest of the FSF leaning camp calls this a sellout.
[21:47:53] <Satin> That's where that mini-split-camp-war started.
[21:48:27] <Satin> Most people I know are somewhere in between. Far more many open source projects have been OSI on paper, but have had many contributers that lean towards stallman's/FSF ideals, even if they don't always execute them.
[21:48:49] <Satin> But anyways that's shrinking. The newest developers often know not a clue where the origin of open source lies at all
[21:48:53] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: I'm still waiting on getting my big pp cpus
[21:48:54] <Satin> to them it's just "open source code model"
[21:49:04] <Satin> I know so many young developers like this on discord and elsewhere

[21:49:13] <Satin> It's just another software methodology 
[21:49:15] <MootPoot> I never really looked into it

[21:50:25] <Satin> they're sort-of-sellouts
[21:50:34] <Satin> Anyways my opinion is, it's backfired hard. For a large chunk of the 2000s and even early 2010s
[21:50:49] <Satin> it was working, distinctly, Microsoft saw linux as a public threat under ballmer, enemy #1 and all of that

[21:51:13] <Satin> and linux might have been smaller but thrived in terms of ideals and as an alternative to that sort of corporate monetaization model
[21:51:16] <Satin> and then android comes in
[21:51:26] <Satin> and then under Satya Nadella Microsoft does a 360
[21:51:51] <Satin> embraces linux, and is now actively co-opting it, and in the process extinguhising any chance of those ideals being distinctly different
[21:51:55] <Satin> CORRUPTION

[21:52:54] <MootPoot> jeez
[21:52:55] <Satin> but it's fucking wrong.
[21:52:55] <Satin> satya recognized early on that microsoft's OS stuff was a dead end. they've pivoted into servers and all of that hosting services shit
[21:52:58] <Satin> and Windows 10 is about how many devices run it, not making a profit
[21:53:09] <MootPoot> same with 11
[21:53:12] <Satin> microsoft doesn't care if you pirate windows 10 anymore unlike in past versions
[21:53:23] <Satin> it's about how many devices run it, so they can say, a billion devices run it
[21:53:24] <MootPoot> Java runs on 14 billion devices
[21:53:31] <Satin> and how good it can become a platform for ads and what not in the future

[22:06:35] <Cryowolf> This vaccine pass thing is a horribly invasive idea. So are forced vaccinations. I mean I'm vaccinated, so it's not that I'm trying to avoid it. But I'm very against those things
[22:07:15] <Cryowolf> but if its gonna happen at least I'm vaccinated and ready for the dystopian future of walker tripods patrolling the streets
[22:07:24] <Cryowolf> mindscans etc
[22:08:03] <satin_offline> I strongly disagree, vaccine passes and such are necessary with the amount of stupid people that aren't being onboard with it
[22:08:10] <Cryowolf> I will become the hero the world doesn't want nor need. I will spread anime to every corner of the dystopia
[22:08:36] <satin_offline> I recognize the threat to hard-earned civil liberties, and the possibility that they're encroached upon by such things
[22:08:36] <Bco1981> for the person, i could not care less. itøs their own damn fault for not getting the vaccine. but those same people is the ones that get the most sick and end up in the hospital and taking up the hospitals resources. and space.
[22:09:02] <Cryowolf> allowing stores etc to not let you in based on vaccinations is fine. Banning you from existing based on a vaccine is wrong
[22:09:02] <satin_offline> but I also think that this is an example of where society does require mandatory passes in order to engage with the rest of the place
[22:09:22] <satin_offline> the west is too obsessed with individualism and liberty to the point where rampant disinformation about something can feed into societal collapse
[22:09:25] <Cryowolf> but omicron isn't even all that deadly
[22:09:25] <satin_offline> and thousands of people dying
[22:09:47] <satin_offline> it is deadly, potentially. it's serious for much of the population that is vulnerable
[22:09:50] <satin_offline> millions have died in the US
[22:09:50] <Cryowolf> yes I am in full support of individualism
[22:09:56] <satin_offline> I'm not. I'm balanced.
[22:10:13] <satin_offline> In my eyes, we got lucky with this pandemic. It could have easily been much worse.
[22:10:33] <Cryowolf> deaths could have been prevented by better procedures and precautions at elderly homes etc
[22:10:39] <satin_offline> What are all the individualism-stanning people like you going to say when Covid 3.0 hits which is explicitly even more deadly?
[22:10:47] <Urchin[emacs]> Cryowolf: it's more "individualism" that we have a problem with
[22:10:52] <satin_offline> and instead of being more lethal to the older and immunocomprimised
[22:10:57] <Cryowolf> if it becomes much more deadly it will kill itself off
[22:10:58] <satin_offline> killed even young people
[22:11:02] <satin_offline> what?
[22:11:03] <Cryowolf> and disappear
[22:11:16] <MootPoot> Tbh - I think this "oh no our rights" is actually just a hinderance to us at this point for this particular matter
[22:11:18] <MootPoot> fuck it
[22:11:27] <Urchin[emacs]> Cryowolf: "individualism" has become a call to people being assholes in systemic ways
[22:11:31] <Bco1981> MootPoot: correct.
[22:11:32] <satin_offline> MootPoot: that's precisely what I'm saying
[22:11:34] <MootPoot> full 100% vaccinations or a one way ticket to madagascar
[22:11:43] <MootPoot> unless you medically cannot take the vaccine
[22:11:45] <MootPoot> in which case
[22:11:47] <MootPoot> thats ok
[22:11:48] <Cryowolf> a virus needs a balance to be optimal in its spread and the more lethal it is, the less capable of spreading it becomes since people will die before they have a chance of carrying the contagion

[22:17:23] <Cryowolf> hopefully the mutations will all settle in that direction making it on par w ith the cold virus
[22:17:27] <satin_offline> emmeka: The original discussion (I might be misunderstanding it) was centered around how vaccine passes might become a thing. I responded that individualism and liberty obsession is bad in cases like this.
[22:17:28] <emmeka> I had a random thought the other day. Lots of cold viruses are actually coronaviruses. I wonder if all of those started out as random zoonotic events like this in prehistory.
[22:17:46] <satin_offline> And I'm also reiterating the point that we got *lucky* that this isn't that lethal.
[22:17:48] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, thats not how it works. If something becomes that deadly, then it becomes easier to trace and isolate/quarantine
[22:17:54] <emmeka> this happened a lot in human history, for example, we know that measles came from a single zoonotic event
[22:17:55] <Cryowolf> it's why Ebola is always stopped for example
[22:18:03] <Cryowolf> cause it's so deadly
[22:18:09] <satin_offline> Cryo is making the point, backed by sources that I'm not sure of, that if it was more lethal, it would kill itself off.
[22:18:19] <emmeka> measles is the same disease as rinderpest, a disease of cattle (one of only 2 diseases eliminated from the face of the earth by humanity)
[22:18:29] <Cryowolf> it would, because it doesnt have a chance to spread before the carrier dies
[22:18:29] <satin_offline> Cryowolf: Jesus Christ. You're going to just say that and not recognize the fact that there were very special teams
[22:18:33] <satin_offline> sent out to stop ebola
[22:18:35] <satin_offline> what the fuck
[22:18:52] <Cryowolf> ....did you even see what I said like just before?

[22:19:02] <emmeka> SARS 1.0 was also far, far more deadly
[22:19:08] <Cryowolf> JUST before, I said exactly that satin_offline
[22:19:19] <satin_offline> Cryowolf: I see your message about that now.
[22:19:20] <Cryowolf> that it was traced, isolated, quarantined
[22:19:23] <emmeka> the SARS outbreak in my province had a mortality rate of around 30%, back in 2003
[22:19:43] <Cryowolf> feel free to apologize for completely misrepresenting me
[22:19:47] <emmeka> but this also made it hard to transmit. the infected tended to be in critical condition very soon after contracting it
[22:19:48] <satin_offline> Cryowolf: Yes and you're underestimating the amount of painstaking work that was taken to find, trace, and isolate that.
[22:20:11] <satin_offline> I apologize for misrepresenting you, but I disagree with your point and your downplaying of pandemics and lethality.
[22:20:30] <emmeka> satin_offline anyway, I don't really care about your previous convo, but I do care about <satin_offline> but now Cryo, contrary to tens of thousands of public health experts <satin_offline> will suddenly peddle things that fringe media describe covid as "not so deadly" and what not
[22:20:39] <emmeka> what Cryowolf said is actually entirely correct
[22:20:59] <emmeka> and you are in fact the one peddling disinformation
[22:21:01] <satin_offline> What I'm picking up (and I could be wrong) is your idea is that pandemics, if they're actually deadly, will kill themselves off and we don't need public healthcare responses that sometimes might encroach on civil liberties in order to preserve lives and public health.
[22:21:12] <Poeticode> dang i lost track of the convo, what should i be mad about?
[22:21:17] <Cryowolf> it wouldnt become a pandemic if it was very deadly
[22:21:32] <satin_offline> ...
[22:21:37] <MootPoot> Poeticode: vtubers
[22:21:52] <Bco1981> MootPoot: no!
[22:21:56] <satin_offline> Can you provide a source for this reasoning?
[22:22:05] <emmeka> Cryowolf I mean that's only true for certain mortality rates of "very deadly", and there are rates well below that that would still be a massive problem
[22:22:06] <MootPoot> the vtuber pandemic
[22:22:07] <Bco1981> bad poot
[22:22:13] <satin_offline> When every significant respectable public health expert warns about the great loss of life from a pandemic?
[22:22:33] <satin_offline> and uses language such as "deadly" and "lethal" to describe it?
[22:22:45] <Poeticode> i'd understand why companies and governments would want mandated vaccines to keep their worker bees healthy, but plz let it be a darwin choice :(
[22:22:48] <emmeka> satin_offline again, he's right, but perhaps glossing over the fact that things like a 5% mortality rate are still bad
[22:23:19] <emmeka> we have conclusive proof of this for the coronavirus specifically, even
[22:24:09] <satin_offline> emmeka: No I'm aware of the point he's making and I think it's incorrect and being misused. Remember this conversation also is mainly about civil liberties, of which I insisted we got lucky when something more deadlier could have insisted, not about COVID specifically.
[22:24:17] <Cryowolf> great loss of life is obvious because of the high number of infected, then there's going to be a high number dead. Especially when you don't have an immunity to the type of strain and when the healthcare system is caught off guard with no knowledge in the best treatment. The vulnerable groups will during the first waves be very exposed. But this doesn't make a virus very deadly, it makes the high spread deadly
[22:24:36] <satin_offline> overall the actual heart of the conversation is "is encroaching on civil liberties for public health okay or not"
[22:24:38] <Cryowolf> thats what I said before, if it was very deadly it wouldn't have been able to spread this far

[22:28:00] <emmeka> satin_offline saying that what Cryowolf is saying is contrary to the consensus of public health experts.
[22:28:05] <Cryowolf> it's not difficult to understand my opinions if you read them without blowing them out of proportion because you're emotional
[22:28:05] <emmeka> he's actually entirely correct.
[22:28:26] <emmeka> Cryowolf hey now. that's not a good tact to take
[22:28:42] <Cryowolf> I've been misrepresented too many times to care
[22:28:59] <satin_offline> Cryowolf: You said these things: "yes I am in full support of individualism" and "deaths could have been prevented by better procedures and precautions at elderly homes etc" and "if it becomes much more deadly it will kill itself off and disappear" 
[22:29:11] <emmeka> no, he didn't say that.
[22:29:20] <satin_offline> yes, he did say that.
[22:29:25] <satin_offline> those are copypasted from his messages bud
[22:29:27] <Cryowolf> a very deadly virus will kill itself off
[22:29:33] <satin_offline> you weren't around apparently
[22:30:01] <Cryowolf> a mutation doesn't just appear in every single person at the snap of fingers
[22:30:02] <emmeka> he said a deadly virus would die off before it became a pandemic, not that an existing pandemic would disappear should it become deadlier for whatever reason
[22:30:04] <Cryowolf> it begins somewhere
[22:30:17] <satin_offline> Those are messages directly copypasted from his messages.
[22:30:32] <Cryowolf> emmeka, I did say that a mutated strain would disappear if it became like bola deadly
[22:30:36] <satin_offline> emmeka: nope
[22:30:37] <Cryowolf> like ebola*
[22:30:39] <emmeka> well, that is correct
[22:30:49] <Cryowolf> not that the entire virus would
[22:31:01] <Cryowolf> at least that's what I was intending to say
[22:31:03] <emmeka> but like I said earlier, that is kind of glossing over the fact that there are mortality rates much lower than that which would also be bad
[22:31:16] <Cryowolf> yes because then it can spread to more people
[22:31:45] <Cryowolf> thats why a successful virus finds a balance between mortality and contagious rates etc
[22:32:00] <Cryowolf> for optimal spread and to survive
[22:32:04] <emmeka> like sure if a COVID strain mutates with 75% mortality rates or whatever, it will probably not spread far. But one with 5%... 10%... one with high mortality rates due to prolonged complications... etc
[22:32:09] <Cryowolf> it's natural selection for viruses
[22:32:18] <Cryowolf> yah
[22:32:48] <Cryowolf> the mutated strain starts somewhere and if it has a super high mortality rate, it will stand out and be quarantined
[22:34:55] <satin_offline> I can agree with that bit regarding optimal survival for viruses. But you posted that in the middle of voicing support for full individualism, and against vaccine passes which I of course disagreed with.
[22:34:58] <Cryowolf> being in support of individualism isn't the same as saying we shouldn't take a collective responsibility to keep our vulnerable safe and do our best to limit our exposure or potentially exposing others
[22:35:35] <Cryowolf> so what? I'm not an NPC, my opinions, thoughts, beliefs etc are complex
[22:35:55] * satin_offline doesn't know what being an NPC means...
[22:36:07] <Cryowolf> I can have seemingly contradictory beliefs

[22:36:35] <MootPoot> but as long as you recognize they are contradictory 
[22:36:36] <satin_offline> What is individualism defined as/mean to you with respect to this situation? The connotation for "individualism" in regards to this pandemic has had very clear calls from protestors shouting it to avoid measures that would stop the spread of the virus.
[22:36:40] <MootPoot> we're not all perfect robots
[22:36:58] <satin_offline> I know you're from Europe and not from the US, but at least here, the connotation is very obvious and clear in the media and elsewhere.
[22:37:10] <emmeka> so
[22:37:10] <MootPoot> but given how you just described it, your indavidualism and collectivism are VERY at odds with each other
[22:37:18] <Cryowolf> satin_offline, I don't know anything ab out what protestors say, shout or whatever over there in the US
[22:37:19] <satin_offline> MootPoot++

[22:37:46] <satin_offline> Cryowolf: That's fair. I guess I should say that's the baggage of connotation I was having here.

[22:40:24] <Cryowolf> individualism in the sense that you should be free to do what you want so long as it doesn't infringe upon anyone elses rights, cause harm, damages etc. So of course if you willingly spread a virus to a vulnerable population that may cause their death, that would be infringing

I only realized their definition of "individualism" was probably different much later and
[22:41:04] <satin_offline> subsequently brought it up so we could have a distinction.

[22:42:30] <Cryowolf> there is nothing in my belief that makes it impossible to take a responsibility to not cause harm to others by reducing the spread or how much you expose others or yourself. Including a vaccine if you want. If you don't take a vaccine though, your responsibility becomes much harder on you
[22:42:42] <satin_offline> emmeka: Here in the US we have governers making vaccine mandates illegal for employees of a company, and in some cases, even measures against the vaccine invalidated by local city councils in the name of individualism.
[22:42:46] <Cryowolf> since you have to do so much more to make sure you don't cause harm to anyone else
[22:43:14] <Cryowolf> where in that am I saying anything crazy, or going against health experts?
[22:43:21] <satin_offline> Of course, as it turns out, the boundaries and what individualism means and resonates, is most likely different in a European context.
[22:43:38] <Cryowolf> also these health experts have changed their minds dozens of times
[22:43:47] <Cryowolf> for a long time they said masks dont do anything
[22:43:54] <Cryowolf> then suddenly they do
[22:44:31] <emmeka> satin_offline tbh, I agree with that.
[22:44:33] <Cryowolf> their inability to make arguments and stick with them, or to engage in an open dialogue is what makes WHO difficult to trust
[22:44:45] <satin_offline> emmeka: what is "that"
[22:44:48] <emmeka> but I'm in favour of anything which restricts the powers of employers
[22:45:09] <Cryowolf> not cause I think there's a conspiracy or anything, but because they're flimsy
[22:45:19] <satin_offline> Oh you're agreeing with me. I thought you were agreeing with the thing I was saying was wrong
[22:45:28] <satin_offline> emmeka: I mean, yes, same
[22:45:43] <emmeka> no, I'm agreeing with the banning of vaccine mandates for employees.
[22:46:04] <satin_offline> Yeah, I'm not agreeing with that.
[22:46:42] <Cryowolf> I think an employer has the right to take precautions to make their employees safe. Forcing someone to inject a substance into their body to do that however, is something I don't suppoprt
[22:47:05] <satin_offline> The US needs a lot more vaccinations. These people are posing significant threat to public health at large by not getting vaccinated. Most of the surging cases that are overloading hospitals are all unvaccinated.
[22:47:12] <emmeka> the pandemic shouldn't make us forget that we should never take power away from workers and hand it to employers.
[22:47:35] <satin_offline> What's your better solution to getting people vaccinated?
[22:48:00] <satin_offline> Vaccine passes? Mandatory vaccinations from the government for every citizen?
[22:48:01] <Cryowolf> emmeka, well an employer does have some rights, but not one invading on another persons
[22:48:37] <satin_offline> In the current context, requiring employers to have vaccinated employees, and especially health institutions, makes sense.
[22:48:38] <Cryowolf> satin_offline, I couildn't answer that on the spot, I would have to think about it
[22:49:09] <satin_offline> Cryowolf: and don't feel like you have to, I recognize this is a very American-situation with a vastly different system, size, and system of government.
[22:49:14] <emmeka> satin_offline tbh at this point I'm sick of the vaccine discussion. Here we have vaccination rates approaching 90% of the adult population
[22:49:19] <Cryowolf> if I was able to answer it on the spot, then experts should too and we'd not have this issue
[22:49:29] <emmeka> and yet still they harp on about it
[22:49:36] <MootPoot> we are approaching 90%?
[22:49:36] <Cryowolf> satin_offline, it is very American

[22:50:39] <satin_offline> Cryowolf: Interesting.
[22:50:44] <Cryowolf> or if it was a "do it or you wont get to work with patients", or if it was free
[22:50:45] <MootPoot> emmeka: helalth department website says its more like approaching 80%
[22:50:47] <MootPoot> not 90

[22:50:56] <MootPoot> oh

[22:56:03] <emmeka> satin_offline live free or die, etc
[22:56:38] * satin_offline thinks this is unrealistic, especially in contexts and situations, like densely populated areas that are closely interconnected and involve coordination from above
[22:56:43] <satin_offline> but yes
[22:56:47] <satin_offline> complicated.
[22:56:59] <satin_offline> balancing act.
[22:57:08] <satin_offline> not one way or the other in my eyes.
[22:57:46] <Cryowolf> most people in Sweden that have been offered the vaccine and are in healthy body to take it, have done so
[22:57:57] <Cryowolf> I had to wait for quite awhile, but now so have I
[22:58:07] <Cryowolf> I had to wait cause of the chemo etc
[22:58:13] <satin_offline> vaccines are freely and widely available in the US and yet a significant chunk of our population has not taken it and refuses to do so
[22:58:14] <emmeka> despite their vocal nature the hardline antivaxxer crowd are a small minority and shrinking
[22:58:42] <satin_offline> no, many people are not antivaxxers
[22:58:44] <satin_offline> they simply won't take it
[22:59:01] <Cryowolf> I think antivaxxers in general are in the extreme and very loud vocal superminority
[22:59:07] <satin_offline> because the antivaxxers spread their shit and tucker carlsons and mike levins and other politicans turn it into politics.
[22:59:11] <emmeka> satin_offline so.
[22:59:36] <emmeka> people are idiots, sky is blue, water is wet
[22:59:42] <Cryowolf> I can understand how people would be concerned about taking the vaccine when they just started coming out and astra zenica had to be stopped etc
[22:59:46] <emmeka> bears shit in the woods
[22:59:49] <Cryowolf> it made people wary and scared
[22:59:53] <Cryowolf> understandably so
[22:59:54] <satin_offline> and hence why vaccine mandates are necessary in some parts of the world
[22:59:58] <satin_offline> the end
[23:00:08] <satin_offline> Cryowolf: for sure
[23:00:25] <Cryowolf> no thats like saying "if you dont take it, we'll make you", your agument doesn't hold up
[23:00:46] <Cryowolf> cause you'd say the same about any country as soon as they say no :P
[23:01:01] <emmeka> satin_offline there's no need to explain here the rationale for why vaccine mandates are being imposed, it is understood
[23:01:04] <emmeka> this is not the issue.
[23:01:29] <satin_offline> emmeka: yes but you used the term "antivaxxers" which means people who won't take any vaccines, at all
[23:01:32] <Cryowolf> something that could be done and probably makes sense is to increase insurance cost if you're not vaccinated
[23:01:34] <satin_offline> if you didn't realize that
[23:01:36] <emmeka> the issue is what amount of civil liberties you're willing to forgo because people are stupid, my answer is none.
[23:01:38] <Cryowolf> for obvious reasons
[23:01:47] <satin_offline> and I was making a distinction and pointing out that it's not really anti vaxxers not taking the vaccine
[23:01:52] <satin_offline> they're indeed a minority
[23:01:55] <emmeka> satin_offline I did realize that, that was in response to "and refuses to do so"
[23:02:04] <satin_offline> emmeka: oh lol
[23:02:14] <satin_offline> uhhh that was not very clear.
[23:02:16] <satin_offline> To me.

[23:03:00] <satin_offline> two very hard hit countries currently
[23:03:02] <satin_offline> xd
[23:03:02] <Cryowolf> so has Austria

[23:03:26] <satin_offline> I'd move there

[23:04:16] <satin_offline> Dec 2
[23:04:16] <satin_offline> wow
[23:04:26] <satin_offline> and in the future soon mandatory vaccines
[23:04:51] <satin_offline> interesting how despite being federalized like us, german central government has sweeping powers like that
[23:05:05] <Cryowolf> I think grocery stores should offer alternatives if they don't allow you in
[23:05:10] <Cryowolf> since people need to eat
[23:05:11] <Cryowolf> or they die
[23:05:24] <satin_offline> or they should just get vaccinated
[23:05:57] <Cryowolf> sure but it wouldnt be a good thing if more people died of starvation
[23:05:57] <emmeka> satin_offline we already did this months ago.
[23:06:00] <satin_offline> unless they have a condition which prevents them, of course
[23:06:20] <satin_offline> emmeka: yes and european countries were less hard hit and more able to have lenient policies for a while
[23:06:30] <emmeka> satin_offline currently in ON vaccines are mandatory for restaurants and any public venue, the only exception being essential services like groceries and pharmacies
[23:06:35] <Cryowolf> Sweden was hit very hard
[23:06:37] <satin_offline> and now it's the US which is hit, but not as badly as Germany and Austria which are skyrocketing
[23:06:39] <Cryowolf> mostly Stockholm though
[23:06:40] <emmeka> this is generally bullshit
[23:06:48] <satin_offline> ON = ?
[23:06:54] <Cryowolf> but we're not doing so bad right now
[23:07:03] <Cryowolf> countries th at went into full lockdown seem to h ave it harder
[23:07:07] <emmeka> smh, yankees gotta learn provinces
[23:07:14] <emmeka> ON is the postal shorthand for Ontario.
[23:07:17] <satin_offline> ontario?
[23:07:26] <satin_offline> Oh see, I guessed that
[23:07:31] <satin_offline> but i got thrown off by the capital N there
[23:07:34] <Cryowolf> brb gonna start food, it's late now
[23:07:35] <satin_offline> so i wasn't sure.
[23:07:41] <satin_offline> Cryowolf: bon appetit
[23:07:53] <satin_offline> emmeka: that does sound bullshit and half-assed though.
[23:08:05] <emmeka> it's also an economic nightmare
[23:08:13] <satin_offline> for sure :/
[23:08:44] <emmeka> imaging telling businesses hi, guess what, you're now banned from selling to like 20% of the population. This after multiple lockdowns have fucked all your finances. k bye
[23:09:15] <satin_offline> all while the big box stores do fine
[23:09:22] <emmeka> if the government wants to go mandating vaccines it should basically court order random retail workers to be its shock troopers
[23:09:27] <emmeka> yeah that's fucked too
[23:09:55] <emmeka> all the little local shops closing or dying, but fuckin Walmart, just chugs along unhindered by lockdowns
[23:10:02] * MootPoot has gotten suckered into another subscription service
[23:10:08] <emmeka> *it shouldn't basically
[23:10:18] <MootPoot> well, time to find what other subscription to cancel to even out the cost
[23:10:23] <satin_offline> yep
[23:10:35] <satin_offline> the biggest winners
[23:10:47] <satin_offline> from COVID are the rich and big corporations who saw their profits generally rise
[23:10:48] <satin_offline> lmao
[23:10:54] <emmeka> like if they want to go mandating these things, just do it fucking properly and get police doing door to door roundups to send them off to the vaccination camp or whatever where they get jabbed by force
[23:10:57] <satin_offline> even outside of the obvious remote work ones
[23:11:03] <emmeka> does that sound bad? yes? because it is
[23:11:24] <MootPoot> time for some more corporate tax
[23:11:37] <emmeka> the way they're doing it now is the same, but basically offloading this responsibility to the private sector so people's options are to either be unemployed and banned from everything in their community, or get jabbed.
[23:11:43] <satin_offline> MootPoot: accompanied with more loopholes
[23:12:13] <satin_offline> emmeka: I don't agree, mandatory vaccinations are good and necessary
[23:12:27] <satin_offline> one way or the other
[23:12:30] <emmeka> you don't agree with what, my characterization or that it sounds bad
[23:12:41] <satin_offline> former
[23:12:50] <emmeka> well what's not to agree with
[23:13:25] <emmeka> you think not only should vaccines be mandated, but private citizens should be mandated by the government to enforce the vaccine mandate at their own expense?
[23:14:01] <satin_offline> a) the underlying notion that it's wrong that a population is being forced to get a vaccine that saves lives and preserves public health
[23:14:01] <emmeka> and refusal to comply comes with a hefty fine of its own
[23:14:19] <emmeka> satin_offline that's a non answer
[23:14:20] <MootPoot> amazon is taking too long
[23:14:22] <satin_offline> b) your exaggerartion of the similarities between private sector approach and a government police roundup
[23:14:32] <MootPoot> hurry up with my damn order
[23:14:39] <emmeka> satin_offline you missed the point, then.
[23:14:50] <MootPoot> its annoying when you want particular things and only scamazon has them
[23:15:01] <satin_offline> I agree it's not being done fairly as it could be or anything 
[23:15:01] <emmeka> I wasn't making that comparison as if to say, the horror, this is basically what they're doing!
[23:15:01] <MootPoot> but takes like a week to deliver from across the country
[23:15:08] <satin_offline> oh
[23:15:21] <MootPoot> satin_offline: can you stop being satin_offline and go back to being Satin

[23:15:36] <MootPoot> I'm using it right now
[23:15:38] <emmeka> satin_offline I made that comparison to say that if they want to mandate vaccines, they should do it properly instead of foisting the task onto random retail workers making minimum wage or whatever

[23:16:13] <MootPoot> it never failed tho
[23:16:17] <MootPoot> only kicked you out
[23:16:20] <MootPoot> I stayed in
[23:16:24] <Satin> emmeka: ok I agree with that.
[23:16:43] <Satin> emmeka: it's benefitting the bosses
[23:17:11] <emmeka> the bosses? hardly.
[23:17:33] <emmeka> it's benefitting the government. retail businesses and workers alike are getting the short stick on this one.
[23:17:57] <Satin> hmm fair yeah
[23:18:20] <Satin> i mean that characterzation is fair and accurate, not that the thing that's happening is fair*
[23:18:23] <emmeka> Satin and tbf, these are both the same thing, saying to people "you can't work or buy things or use any services unless you're vaccinated" is the same as rounding them up and vaccinating them, the only reason the former is being done instead of the latter is because it is less susceptible to criticism
[23:18:44] <Satin> and I'm ok with the former
[23:18:54] <emmeka> so why not just come out and say you're ok with the latter?
[23:18:54] <Satin> it's better then the latter or something worse
[23:19:05] <Satin> because the devil's in the details
[23:19:10] <emmeka> well, the former infringes on far, far more people's rights
[23:19:15] <emmeka> in some respects it is much worse
[23:19:24] <Satin> I'm shameless about saying that people def need to be forced to get the vaccine one way or the other.
[23:19:31] <Satin> but the manner in which it is carried about matters
[23:19:35] <Poeticode> poor bezos :(
[23:19:46] <Satin> the former is far more preferable than a roundup, and less direct-libert-infriging
[23:19:48] <Satin> Poeticode: lol
[23:19:51] <MootPoot> bezos nekomimi
[23:19:54] <Satin> MootPoot: stop
[23:19:58] <Satin> right there
[23:20:10] <MootPoot> lol
[23:20:12] <emmeka> Satin less direct liberty infringing, but to far less people
[23:20:20] <MootPoot> why do you think he went bald?

[23:20:34] *** Joins: Libre_Algernon (~armitage@181.160.13.237)
[23:20:46] <emmeka> what's worse, infringing the rights of only those who won't get jabbed, or refusing rights to EVERYONE because some people won't get jabbed
[23:20:50] <Satin> emmeka: why is the former more liberty infringinging to you than being directly have the popo come to your home to get vaccinated or else
[23:20:57] <MootPoot> imagine hairless ears on bezos - sphynx cat nekomimi on bezos
[23:21:04] <emmeka> because I'm not an idiot and am already vaccinated.
[23:21:25] <Cryowolf> being back home and lying down in my memory foam bed for the first time in a week is so good
[23:21:28] <Satin> those "some people won't get jabbed" are a significant chunk of the population
[23:21:41] <Satin> and overload the healthcare system crippling it for others
[23:21:56] <Satin> and pose a threat for millions who have conditions that don't let them get vaccinated themselves
[23:22:01] <emmeka> sure, but with a vaccine mandate your choices are infringe their rights directly, or infringe everyone's.
[23:22:04] <emmeka> choose, I guess
[23:22:09] <Satin> and any effective broad mandate requires infringing everyone's to some extent.

[23:24:33] <DPA> Don't mandate vaccines. Lift all restrictions. Just don't let the unvaccinated infected people into the hospitals. Everyone will be happier (with the exception of the people who made the wrong decision)
[23:25:11] <DPA> (But when they notice, it'll be too late anyway)
[23:25:11] <Satin> DPA: except those unvaccinated people spread it to vulnerable populations that can't get the vaccine, or against who the vaccine is less effective against
[23:25:27] <Satin> and also provide a fantastic ground for more mutations that are resistant to the existing vaccines
[23:25:48] <Satin> not to mention getting a vaccine doesn't mean 100% immunity
[23:25:52] <MootPoot> DPA: I'd appreciate having the ability for my 60+ year old parents to be able to go to the hospial even though they're vaccinated, and not have it clogged with dying antivaxxers
[23:26:05] <Cryowolf> if most people get the vaccine, herd immunity kicks in anyway
[23:26:19] <Satin> oui
[23:26:22] <Cryowolf> if a small percentage won't, they will have little to no impact
[23:26:36] <Satin> right now that small percentage in countries like germany are a huge deal
[23:26:43] <Satin> rather, what is a small percentage
[23:26:50] <Cryowolf> 10% maybe
[23:26:58] <Satin> of what sized country?
[23:27:01] <Satin> pop wise*
[23:27:05] <DPA> In my country, it's not a problem to get the vaccine. It's free, there is enough of it, and almost all people who aren't against it took it by now.
[23:27:12] <Cryowolf> doesnt matter, what you should be asking is density
[23:27:15] <Satin> coz 10% is a lot of people in a country like germany which overload and cause trouble anyways
[23:27:16] <Nanobot> I live in the redneck area of California. You'd never notice we were in a pandemic except for the sudden *increase* in people's activity and the death/hospitalization rates.
[23:27:37] <Cryowolf> you can have a massive population and be sparse
[23:27:43] <Cryowolf> or a small population and be dense
[23:27:54] <Nanobot> Hardly anybody here took the pandemic seriously, and now we're the worst area in California in terms of covid-related deaths and hospitalizations.
[23:27:57] <Satin> Cryowolf: cars and all though
[23:28:00] <Cryowolf> look at singapore
[23:28:03] <Cryowolf> small country
[23:28:05] <Cryowolf> extremely dense
[23:28:08] <DPA> And while infections while vaccinated are still possible, they are much less likely to be very bad / deadly.
[23:28:22] <Satin> DPA: correct
[23:28:33] <Cryowolf> Satin, most people don't travel much outside of a certain radius
[23:28:34] <Satin> DPA: what's your country if i might ask
[23:28:38] <Cryowolf> I forget what it was
[23:28:44] <Cryowolf> but there's actual studies on that
[23:28:50] <Satin> Cryowolf: 30 miles? we americans spread it all over the place as far as i can tell
[23:29:02] <Satin> Cryowolf: we should be having interstate travel banned sometimes, but we haven't
[23:29:09] <Satin> idk
[23:29:14] <DPA> Switzerland
[23:29:16] <Satin> it's probably 30 miles
[23:29:22] <MootPoot> >miles
[23:29:23] <MootPoot> lma0
[23:29:24] <Satin> i heard that radius before
[23:29:25] <Satin> KM*
[23:29:28] <Cryowolf> why? Your interstates would be the easiest way to control it since you have very few and very long
[23:29:48] <MootPoot> few? dosen't the US have like #2 number of roads
[23:29:51] <MootPoot> or amount of road
[23:29:57] <Cryowolf> DPA, Switzerland is very sparsely populated and due to the terrain, travel is difficult. So the spread is limited
[23:29:57] <MootPoot> second only to china
[23:29:58] <Satin> Cryowolf: interstate as in, not letting people in from other states. which is something that did happen early on and did help stem it to some degree back then
[23:29:59] <Cryowolf> more limited
[23:30:12] <Satin> it's obviously difficult, economically and practically to keep that sort of thing going, and not all states did that at all
[23:30:15] <Satin> which didn't help but yes
[23:30:30] <Nanobot> There was a local church that boasted about how they weren't going to reduce their capacity at all during the pandemic. Almost everyone who attended that church ended up catching covid.
[23:30:33] <Satin> new mexico did something like requiring out of state travellers to be quarantined for 14 days
[23:30:37] <Satin> early on
[23:30:37] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, the US doesn't have many roads that go uninterrupted from coast to coast
[23:30:41] <Satin> Nanobot: lol
[23:30:45] <Cryowolf> the interstates
[23:30:54] <Cryowolf> forgot the number
[23:31:04] <DPA> There are roads & public transport everywhere, and we do have cities too. It's by far not sparse enough to prevent a disease from spreading efficiently.
[23:31:15] <Satin> Cryowolf: yeah for sure, but no one's banning it, for political and economic reasons i guess
[23:31:35] <Satin> and also the federal government having a hard time, legally, once again, to do that
[23:31:58] <Cryowolf> they can't interfere in state business so yeah
[23:32:20] <Satin> it's complicated. they can to some degree, but in others they can't
[23:32:31] <Satin> and often the federal government has been using this one outdated clause in the interstate federal act etc

[23:32:55] <Satin> yeah i get that

[23:36:39] <Cryowolf> its a sale in Sweden going between Christmas and New Year
[23:36:42] <Cryowolf> 26th to 30th
[23:36:57] <Cryowolf> some places 25th
[23:38:45] <Satin> ooh
[23:39:05] <Satin> I wonder. I didn't hear of much people getting really good deals on black friday recently
[23:39:08] <Cryowolf> Im gonna look to find a mini led then
[23:39:30] <Cryowolf> that would be because there arent many new stuff being manufactured
[23:39:34] <Bco1981> i think i got my pentium mmx 233mhz... i can't tell, it looks like one but i can't see the 233 anywhere on it.

[23:39:44] <Cryowolf> lack of components and ships not being allowed into port
[23:39:57] <Cryowolf> ships stocked with an abundance of those components
[23:40:00] <Bco1981> truck loads stolen
[23:40:04] <Cryowolf> not allowed in
[23:40:06] <Satin> Oh yeah
[23:40:21] <Satin> are european countries also having a hard time with shipping etc?
[23:40:26] <Bco1981> yes
[23:40:27] <Satin> Over here it's mainly the port of LA
[23:40:30] <Cryowolf> yah
[23:40:32] <Satin> i see.
[23:40:43] <Cryowolf> cause components come from outside of europe
[23:41:02] <Cryowolf> and there's  a shortage so
[23:41:13] <Cryowolf> I still hope to get a good priced mini led tv
[23:41:21] <Satin> i see i see
[23:41:55] <Cryowolf> tcl is the budget option. Right now without a sale they're 1200 euro for a mini led
[23:42:04] <MootPoot> damn
[23:42:08] <Cryowolf> but thats with "only" 160 (or 180?) dimming zones

[23:42:14] <Satin> wow
[23:42:18] <MootPoot> thats like roughly what my monitor cost
[23:42:25] <MootPoot> although your prices are post tax
[23:42:27] <MootPoot> so there is that
[23:43:05] <Cryowolf> Satin, yeah that happens. Thats why I look at websites that track prices for months and check the products on sale matching with that chart
[23:43:09] <Cryowolf> and see if its a real sale
[23:43:51] <Cryowolf> a lot of them here were, like LG QNED91 or whatever, 90? something anyway...it was down to 1500 euro on sale, now it's back up to 2500

[23:54:40] <Cryowolf> My microphone arm that I got for 16 euro is working nicely
[23:54:47] <Cryowolf> sturdy bastard for being  so cheap
[23:55:07] <Bco1981> sturdy now, look at it in a year.
[23:56:06] <Cryowolf> sure
[23:56:19] <Cryowolf> but Im not a hardcore microphone arm user, not like I lead a podcast
[23:56:37] <Cryowolf> oiling it every few months and not being it how it shouldnt be bent
