[00:31:39] <SysGhost> d3ph4u17: could very well be the case of the firmware not working as expected. Maybe even not fixable. At least not without major changes to the subsystems.
[00:31:42] <Namarrgon> last update was a decade ago, the driver itself is probably not getting much love either
[00:32:01] <susi> MrElendig: those files in /etc/xdg/systemd/user (arbitrary symlinks to /usr/lib .sockets) are last accessed when I installed this system in Dec 24, except for one (pulseaudio.socket) that's last accessed in january
[00:32:03] <MrElendig> https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/main/src/basic/path-lookup.c#L71 is fun
[00:32:23] <d3ph4u17> if the firmware didn't work as intended then it wouldn't work under windows too right?
[00:32:27] <susi> MrElendig: so must be some kind of user error on my behalf that got /etc/xdg/systemd/user/ stuff created, or sumthin

[02:00:45] <th0rne> It's so that sudo asks for root password instead of your password.
[02:01:05] <kevr> so sudo was misconfigured?

[05:51:12] <grazzolini> lantech19446: pacman packages can be compressed in many formats. most usually nowadays is tar.zst. however, you have downloaded the binary version of code, which is not a valid pacman package.

[13:50:46] <Foxboron> Ah yes, --align-payload is deprecated with luks2 and you should use --offset, which is with cryptsetup 2.4 automagically figured out
[13:51:04] <Nitrousoxide> Yea I was just about to say that
[13:51:40] <Nitrousoxide> i checked the man pages just a few minutes ago because I was worried it might have been changed after all these years

[13:52:37] <Nitrousoxide> So tl;dr is that --align-payload is depreciated in favor of --offset, but I shouldn't even need to do that because it's calculated automatically?
[13:52:57] <Foxboron> if you have cryptsetup 2.4 (not on this months iso), then yes

[13:54:44] <Nitrousoxide> In that case, what offset should be used?

[13:56:06] <Nitrousoxide> lovely haha
[13:56:30] <Foxboron> What sort of disk? SSD/NVME/HDD? What is the logical and physical sector size (the one reported by the disk and the one that was partitioned with) and so on

[13:57:49] <Nitrousoxide> So should I just bite the bullet and leave that option out
[13:57:57] <baltazar> Nitrousoxide: couldn't you just do a system upgrade on the iso? assuming you have enough ram
[13:58:05] <baltazar> then you'd have cryptsetup 2.4
[13:58:25] <Foxboron> Ideally you want 4096 if the disk supports it. But in many cases you still have 512 sector size

I think I have an error, if I create a group using 'sudo groupadd sftponly' , then I think that the group is created, also , this is confirmed if I run the command again then the response is that the group already exists. However if I add a user to that group then I receive the error that the group does not exist. I have checked the spelling of the group I am putting everywhere and it is

[14:12:15] <baltazar> KDBoy: what are you running to add an user to the group?
[14:13:03] <baltazar> `usermod -aG <group> <user>` should be the one

[22:49:14] <Namarrgon> then you must configure networking yourself
[22:49:18] <thurstylark> ^
[22:49:24] <thrice> during the install, you probably used iwctl or something to have networking
[22:49:29] <John_Ivan> wait hold on.

[22:49:41] <John_Ivan> No. It worked directly because I'm on ethernet.

[22:49:55] <Namarrgon> on the iso it works but that doesn't transfer to the new system
[22:49:58] <John_Ivan> I followed the steps in sequential order. Followed by setting up host config.
[22:50:13] <thurstylark> regardless of if you're using ethernet or wifi, network config in the new install is still manual
[22:50:15] <John_Ivan> So then, where is the step for actually setting up networking? Is it what I quoted above for
[22:50:23] <John_Ivan> "Complete the network configuration for the newly installed environment, that may include installing suitable network management software. "
[22:50:23] <John_Ivan> ?
[22:50:28] <thurstylark> that depends on which network manager you choose
[22:50:58] <thurstylark> choose a network manager, install it, configure it

[22:55:34] <zeraphel> NM is a pain in the ass for anything more complicated than connecting to a single network at a time
[22:55:45] <MrElendig> zeraphel: the opposite
[22:55:50] <topcat001> Also in complicated setups involving VPNs and just NM seems to usually do the right thing by default.
[22:55:54] <topcat001> lol exactly

[22:56:31] <MrElendig> wg support is pretty shoddy in nm :(

[22:56:49] <topcat001> Yes I'm sure there are some issues.
[22:57:20] <topcat001> Perhaps they can improve on that (and need to be "encouraged").
