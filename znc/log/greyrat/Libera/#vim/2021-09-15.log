[07:11:28] <nickspoon> As for quickfix and refactoring, I don't have tutorial recommendations but the basic idea is that vim builtins like  :grep and :vimgrep  (searching)  and :make (compiling)  populate the quickfix list. Once populated you navigate the results in various ways, either using the quickfix window, or using commands like :cnext/:cprevious

[07:13:37] <nickspoon> How you transfer those results into refactoring depends on the situation. I use a several different ways.
[07:13:54] <nickspoon> Sometimes I just write a macro and run it on each quickfix file 
[07:14:37] <nickspoon> Sometimes I use the EnMasse plugin, which is good for editing the lines of the quickfix results in a single vim buffer (even though the actual results are spread over multiple files)
[07:15:19] <nickspoon> Sometimes I use the :cdo and :cfdo commands, which run a command once for each quickfix result, or quickfix result file

[07:28:52] <Intelo> nickspoon I see. so what would you do if you have to a) search and replace in multiple files but select the changes yourself via quickfix b) move a file to another location and change its paths in other files referring to it e.g in `import` statements
[07:29:30] <nickspoon> Nitrousoxide: you add it to your vimrc. If you don't have a .vimrc and you're making a new one, it's a good idea to copy the "example" vimrc or "defaults.vim" that comes with your vim. You can see this file like this:  
[07:29:55] <nickspoon> (from inside vim)
[07:30:09] <nickspoon> :e $VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim
[07:30:11] <nickspoon> or

[07:32:34] <Nitrousoxide> Okay, thank you.
[07:32:37] <nickspoon> (personally I prefer ~/.vim/vimrc to ~/.vimrc)
[07:32:57] <Nitrousoxide> I tend to prefer paths like that as well, will that be recognized automaticallY?
[07:33:03] <nickspoon> Vim looks for both locations
[07:33:09] <Nitrousoxide> Perfect
[07:33:12] <Nitrousoxide> Thank you.
[07:33:18] <nickspoon> you're welcome
[07:34:04] <nickspoon> Intelo: In both cases I'd use :grep to find the locations I'm interested in. If it's a simple and consistent replacement, I'd probably run the replacement as a :s command on each quickfix result using :cdo

[07:36:02] <nickspoon> Intelo: :grep uses an external search tool. It defaults to using your system grep (on *nix, or findstr on windows). You configure it by setting  grepprg
[07:36:28] <nickspoon> So I have grepprg configured to use ripgrep, which is much much faster than grep

[07:52:04] <Intelo> clear now. That confused me.
[07:54:24] <Intelo> Last question, how to select a single file with some short key to accept or reject. I do not remeber but I saw that somewhere..   and I still wonder whats the best way to move a file to some new location. There maybe 100s of files refering to it in `import` path and that path will be different for each file (depending on its relative location). I
[07:54:24] <Intelo> wonder how can I change to new correct paths if I move/refactor that file.

[07:56:30] <Intelo> ya.. and more clueless. I wonder how you do it? or should be done
[07:58:55] <nickspoon> It depends on lots of things. You could script something up that uses e.g. fnamemodify() to get a path relative to the file you're editing? 
[07:59:53] <Intelo> whats fnamemodify()?
[08:00:36] <Intelo> nickspoon theres no buildting thing?
[08:00:39] <Intelo> there can be many more such examples. e.g you change function name `getFirstName()` in file `b` to `getFN()` but there was already another `getFirstName()` in file `a`. Now both `a` and `b` are used by several other files. Its hard to possibly know which to rename in quickfix. This part the IDE does smoothly but I wonder how to do it in
[08:00:39] <Intelo> vim/quickfix or any other way.

[08:03:50] <igemnace> Intelo: in general, such refactoring features in an IDE are driven by a code analysis tool. vim doesn't have that by default
[08:04:18] <Intelo> igemnace nickspoon ok, so when you guys encounter such things, how do you handle it?
[08:04:36] <igemnace> but there *are* code analysis tools that can be integrated. LSP is a neat route you can read about
[08:04:58] <Intelo> such as? 
[08:05:01] <igemnace> i personally just use dumb projectwide search and text editing
[08:05:08] <Intelo> what do you guys do in such situations?
[08:05:15] <Intelo> igemnace oh
[08:05:16] <igemnace> Intelo: LSP is one of the examples
[08:05:44] <Intelo> so LSP will do all the above things for me that I mentioned?
[08:05:44] <igemnace> Intelo: https://langserver.org
[08:05:52] <Intelo> I have it installed and configured
[08:06:03] <Intelo> the goto definitions, rename works fine
[08:06:15] <Intelo> I have not explored more
[08:06:28] <igemnace> i'd implore you to read more about it, because LSP is not a single thing to discuss. it's a protocol for LSP servers to talk to LSP clients, and YMMV depending on which server and client you use
[08:06:29] <Intelo> it took me several days to make LSP work though btw
[08:07:00] <Intelo> neovims' builtin one
[08:07:09] <igemnace> what language?
[08:07:15] <Intelo> js, ts, java
[08:07:50] <Intelo> so there is not good way except LSP for such refactorings?
[08:08:03] <Intelo> OR make my own script which will be an overkill maybe
[08:09:19] <igemnace> there are other static analysis tools. one that i know of for js is tern. i don't know of any off the top of my head for java (i've only mainly worked on java through an IDE)
[08:10:03] <Intelo> igemnace thanks!
[08:10:31] <Intelo> so one do get stuck in such situations. Just curious, what you both use igemnace nickspoon
[08:10:36] <igemnace> tsc has always been the canonical compiler/analysis tool for ts, and it is pretty much the progenitor of LSP to my understanding, so no other static analysis tools off the top of my head either, and i doubt you'd find one outside the LSP-compatible tsc
[08:10:42] <Intelo> in situations exactly like I said
[08:11:38] <igemnace> Intelo: i do dumb projectwide search and text editing. e.g. i :grep for the thing i want to replace, and :cdo s/// if i can, or edit manually then repeat with . or macro recordings

[08:12:38] <Intelo> igemnace that won't solve the `import` and `getFirstName()` issue
[08:12:43] <Intelo> igemnace will it?
[08:12:58] <Intelo> if there are 100s of files. it will take you hours
[08:13:42] <igemnace> i simply don't run into that problem often enough and on a large enough scale
[08:14:12] <igemnace> you're asking two different questions: what to do, and what *I* do. i'm simply answering both
[08:15:54] <Intelo> alright.
[08:16:26] <Intelo> igemnace thanks. that makes sense. I guess I would do a mix of both. what you do and what you recommended :)

[14:45:09] <m4r35n357> well I can read it, but I don't know what cErrInBracket or cBadBlock mean.  I can guess, but that is not helping me ATM
[14:45:13] <habamax> 2. vim has syntax file for C that defines syntax and how each syntax element should be highlighted (thus see cErrInBracket)

[14:48:44] <m4r35n357> habamax, I am simply reporting what looks like a bug, so confirming it is a start.
[14:48:50] <habamax> I should probably tell you just that all vim syntax files are not perfect

[14:49:43] <m4r35n357> Just posted here in the hope that someone might know a fix . . .
[14:50:01] <habamax> so you have at least 2 options, 1 - fix it yourself the way you think it should be, 2 ask c-syntax file maintainer to fix it
[14:50:21] <habamax> and I doubt c-syntax file maintainer is here
[14:50:44] <m4r35n357> habamax, 1 is out of the question, I have tried to go down this rabbit hole many times and I always get stuck pointing the wrong way!
[14:50:46] <habamax> FWIW, if you set ft=cpp
[14:51:04] <habamax> there is no that error hl
[14:51:21] <m4r35n357> is there a c syntax file maintainer?
[14:51:50] <habamax> it is probably Bram himself
[14:51:57] <habamax> :e $VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin/c.vim
[14:52:25] <m4r35n357> habamax, I have already looked at that file and closed it again in despari!
[14:52:49] <habamax> or rather :e $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/c.vim there should be maintainer specified on top of the file
[14:52:56] <m4r35n357> hab OK
[14:53:19] <m4r35n357> yes it says Bram  Moolenar

[17:08:39] <m4r35n357> habamax, I said earlier I am not an expert at vim config.  I need to look at this outside the context of any particular problem, as it is very complixcated!  On top of the "syntax/colour scheme/vimrc" files, there is a problem with distribution setups.  For ecample, If I make a single line ~/.vimrc to cure the "visual mouse" problem, I lose all the Debian default vimrc . . . and things like that
[17:09:09] <m4r35n357> I think this is a project in its own right!
[17:09:13] <habamax> m4r35n357: that is defaults.vim fault :)
[17:09:26] * romainl sigh
[17:09:50] <m4r35n357> habamax, that may be so, but solving it involves understanding the distro issues, and not fighting them!
[17:10:02] <romainl> maybe it does
[17:10:09] <habamax> how many ppl were beaten by it
[17:10:38] <romainl> distro people have no business configuring userland programs on my behalf
[17:10:56] <m4r35n357> habamax, I am beaten by it (usually temporarily) every time I do a new installation
[17:11:39] <m4r35n357> thing is, there is usually a good reason, but it is not always easy to find the "right way" tha will not break things or get undone on upgrade . . . 
[17:11:45] <habamax> m4r35n357: in short, Bram had decided to do "good" and introduced "better" defaults that are in place only if there is no user vimrc

[17:15:29] <m4r35n357> anyhow I am reading it now!
[17:15:47] <habamax> it is easier, there is a clean explanation of what is going on and how to deal with it -- for exactly your case

[17:20:20] * habamax should propose my wife a vim course for a se*cough**cough*
[17:20:44] <m4r35n357> romainl, that is the thing, it is a standard OS component, rplaving vi from Unix.  The vast majority will not see it as a "power tool", even if it is!
[17:21:11] <romainl> which is fine, as the vast majority don't have a use for it
[17:21:15] <m4r35n357> As I said, I need to do this, but as a project in its own right, not as part of trying to solve a particular problem
[17:21:43] <romainl> but if you go around programming with it then you owe it to yourself (at the very least) to learn it properly
[17:22:51] <m4r35n357> romainl, I have not used it that much for programming until very recently, i did most of my work in Geany, but focused on Vim recently when I found a way of highlighting function names, which Geany does not do
[17:23:08] <m4r35n357> previously I just used it for sysdmin tasks
