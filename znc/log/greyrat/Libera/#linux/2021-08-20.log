[04:42:56] <jochum> ciphrCat: not sure about my last sentence, its a trial and error thing. I have no disk to test it out .. could make a loop.
[04:43:11] <ciphrCat> i'm /not/ interested in secure wiping.  (if I were, I would do dd if=/dev/zero..).  I'm interested in speed so I get my sfdisk command to work
[04:44:25] <ciphrCat> it seems wipefs is what i'm after.. it's just wiping a signature, which as far as I understand is just a bit of metadata that fdisk gives warnings about
[04:44:27] <Dagmar> Then you're in luck because wipefs isn't either
[04:44:41] <Dagmar> It just rips the signatures and partition tables off and optionally throws them in a bin for you
[04:44:55] <ciphrCat> sounds good.. thanks
[04:45:32] <jochum> ciphrCat: if not automated you could try parted, but I think it's automated.

[06:16:45] <jochum> there are many tools like iftop
[06:17:12] <Psi-Jack> What do you REALLY want lockywolf ? Cause you can't just ask for a "lighter version" of something, that's already pretty freaking simple.
[06:17:29] <lockywolf> ntopng is not a "freaking simple"
[06:17:36] <lockywolf> have a look at it yourself
[06:17:50] <Psi-Jack> Yes, I know what it is.
[06:17:51] <jochum> ntopng is great tool for long time monitoring
[06:18:03] <jochum> iftop is great tool for short checks

[06:18:25] <Psi-Jack> So, again, what are you ultimately looking for, generally speaking? Think baseline here.
[06:18:57] <lockywolf> I think I actually need two things. iftop is one of those, but since I have seen ntopng, I want something for long-term monitoring as well

[08:29:55] <Dagmar> newbs: unless you're doing something almost boringly normal there, you'll probably be better off telling networkmanager to just ignore the interface and just issue the ifconfig/iwconfig commands directly with your script.
[08:30:02] <newbs> Im trying to set cloned-mac-address setting to preserve. That seems to be the reason my mac changes back to permanent after connecting to the wireless router
[08:30:34] <newbs> network manager is overriding all my ifconfig commands
[08:30:48] <Dagmar> THat's why you tell it to take it's mitts off the interface.

[13:46:27] <xx> heh
[13:46:41] <BCMM> xx: almost all distros are set up so that root is mounted read-only at boot, but the init system subsequently remounts it rw
[13:46:49] <mlu> mounting it as read-only make sure that you don't corrupt the filesystem further if it's already unclean
[13:46:53] <xx> out of curiosity, if I wanted to test this, how could I reversibly corrupt my filesystem to demonstrate this?
[13:47:12] <mlu> xx: you can't really -- create a VM with a filesystem you're willing to corrupt permanently

[18:22:33] <Dagmar> If you are looking to build a device that provides a persistent and reliable record, then it's not time to guess at it because minor mistakes will mean months and months of wall-clock time wasted while the system was silently _not_ working correctly

[18:23:10] <ananke> blackgatonegro: vast majority of advanced electronics with li-ion & li-po batteries never allow for full battery draining, because that damages them. so even if your tablet doesn't turn on, its clock will be still kept alive.

[18:25:37] <hexnewbie> ananke: Um, I can't recall for sure. It was an Italian brand, though.

[18:26:18] <_BobbyTables> yes blackgatonegro it does in my understanding. My point is the tablet is never without a reliable power supply in its normal operation, so time-keeping issues because of power loss are a non factor
[18:26:32] <blackgatonegro> Dagmar hence why is much safer to connect things to something that has a bios clock as that has their own battery that lasts a whole lot.

[18:47:27] <hexnewbie> Um, actually, my bad. Pre-Win32 software would use the non-existing “ANSI codepages” (i.e. Windows-12xx and stuff), *not* DOS codepages. So, short names or DOS software

[22:10:27] <MrElendig> sudomann: selinux and sudo are completely different things
[22:10:57] <sudomann> Has linux not had the features from day of users and groups and file permisions which covers all that? selinux sounds like that but more granular?
[22:11:12] <n4dir> hajonnes: also which graphics card and such. Which my hardware i would simply let it be removed, if i don't like the result, reinstall it
[22:11:15] <ayecee> hajonnes: autoremove shows you packages that were installed automatically, but that nothing depends on anymore. you can either change it to manual (apt-get install packagename), or install the package that depended on it before.
[22:11:35] <sudomann> ~~from day~~

[22:25:34] <ayecee> hajonnes: the description says to me that this is not a dummy/transitional package
[22:25:37] <Dagmar> For reads, overlayfs will work

[22:26:16] <Dagmar> All the bulletpoints, plus a little more speed

[22:29:08] <SmashingX> I think there's a command in Linux that can help you verify SSL files, like for example I have the .crt .pem and .key files I just need to verify if those files match or not.

[22:30:17] <ayecee> taking up space!
[22:30:22] <SmashingX> the .pem file has two certificate blocks

[22:30:58] <SmashingX> the problem is nginx

[22:31:06] <ossifrage> ayecee, hodapp, It was very stable and then I updated some nivida CUDA stuff and magically got hardware video decoding support. But after that I started getting full browser crashes (gpu memory allocation/fragmentation related) however today's crash was slightly different.
[22:31:26] <ayecee> SmashingX: i usually google "openssl cheat sheet" for this. within the first few hits is one that has openssl commands for a bunch of scenarios.
[22:31:28] <SmashingX> nginx: [emerg] SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file("/etc/pki/tls/certs/certificate_com.key") failed (SSL: error:0B080074:x509 certificate routines:X509_check_private_key:key values mismatch)

[22:34:05] <remyabel> ayecee: I can see from the pixels on the screen

[22:43:17] <Dagmar> You can.  It's only _ever_ needed by the signing authority
[22:43:32] <SmashingX> I had to use systemctl instead of nginx -s reload
[22:43:41] <Dagmar> Yay systemd

[22:43:50] <SmashingX> I'm not sure why
[22:44:09] <SmashingX> we had 10 production website down, so I was sweating a lot

[23:24:22] <hexnewbie> It's a joke in 2021. In 2030-2040? Who knows. That alleged WordPerfect blank screen support call that ended with “the power is out in the building” has already expired
[23:25:05] <hajonnes> ayecee, so basically if I do not want apt-autoremove to remove my drivers. I should install the nvidia 470 driver manually?
[23:25:34] <Dagmar> Only if the packaged version has already been removed
[23:25:45] <jab416171> yes you'll want to mark it as explicit hajonnes
[23:25:55] <Dagmar> ...because if the packaged version overwrites the files, when you remove the package it will leave you with nothing
[23:26:38] <ayecee> hajonnes: yes
[23:27:16] <ayecee> hajonnes: like, apt-get install nvidia-drivers-470, which will change the existing package from auto to manual
[23:27:30] <hajonnes> ayecee, yes... perfect...
[23:27:33] <hajonnes> :)
[23:28:21] <jab416171> or just apt-mark manual nvidia-drivers-470
