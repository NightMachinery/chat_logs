[01:06:29] <technomancy> johnjay: yeah they never really finished it
[01:06:31] <krux02> what I heared about those tools is, they make the easy part of writing a compiler easy, but don't help with the hard part.
[01:06:36] <johnjay> in fact i had to install flex and bison to compile bash
[01:06:59] <johnjay> i was thinking the other day an elisp compiler would be necessary though
[01:07:17] <johnjay> any attempt to replace emacs that doesn't have a bridge for existing legacy code i.e. elisp isn't going to get traction
[01:07:20] <artefact> lisp is not particularly hard to parse. unlike some other languages with undecidable grammars *looks at c++*
[01:08:28] <Catie> I mean, there's a reason that a lot of introductory materials on compiler construction use limited dialects of Lisp
[01:09:08] <technomancy> artefact: it's hard to compile it in a way that preserves compatibility with two existing ecosystems
[01:09:09] <e1f> i don't think you're implying that installing a program is equivalent to using it or even mastering it. at least i hope not.
[01:09:15] <krux02> I am currently writing my own compiler, and the parser part is actually just a small part
[01:09:17] <technomancy> it's easy to compile if you get to make up the rules of how the language works for yourself
[01:09:30] <krux02> of course you should know about recursive descent parsing and different grammar types.
[01:09:38] <krux02> compiler construction theory is important.
[01:09:44] <technomancy> it's really not, for a lisp
[01:09:52] <krux02> but the tool you use to follow it is not.
[01:10:01] <krux02> you can do it in basically any language.
[01:10:19] <technomancy> you don't need any theory to parse a lisp; you can easily reinvent the wheel and still make something perfectly serviceable
[01:10:33] <johnjay> technomancy: if that's true then shouldn't the guile elisp thing be easy?
[01:10:42] <technomancy> johnjay: it is easy, to parse
[01:10:43] <johnjay> or is it emacs and not elisp that it foundered

I was just hearing today of the most recent security researcher who dropped their exploits after Apple sat on them for like six months, and you have to wonder what's going on in the company.
[01:26:49] <dale> bpalmer: Maybe "coasting" isn't he right metaphor, maybe it's more of "our products are too complex for our ossified culture to manage anymore".

[03:55:45] <bpalmer> rudybot: where is a good place to fight star wars?
[03:55:53] <yates> is there a way to interleave org-mode notes in a .tex (latex) document? namely, into beamer? 
[03:55:57] <rudybot> bpalmer: You'd think that if lucas considers Star Wars to be a "living document", he would be *happy* to publish changelogs, rather than fight Congress for the privilege of suppressing them
[03:56:12] <yates> i am finding beamer's "\note" primitive to be a joke. 
[03:56:36] <bpalmer> how so?
[03:56:54] <johnjay> is ansi-term the one that you have to use C-C C-l to get out of?
[03:57:02] <johnjay> or is that like eshell or something else
[03:57:15] <yates> bpalmer: separate \note macros just run the notes together into one long line. 
[03:57:24] <technomancy> 𝅘𝅥𝅯 "Star wars; these are the star wars; they're just like our wars, but they're in space." 𝅘𝅥𝅯
[03:57:54] <bpalmer> yates: \note[itemize]{\item{foo}\item{bar}
[03:57:56] <bpalmer> }
[03:58:00] <yates> if you use the "\note<enum-lelve>" construct it puts one note per page...

[03:58:59] <technomancy> but it makes sense that a full terminal would need the ability to intercept all keystrokes
[03:59:21] <technomancy> which a shell doesn't need
[03:59:44] <bpalmer> I guess I've never used \note<1> ,  \note<2>  , etc.
[04:00:00] <johnjay> it says C-c C-j or C-c C-k
[04:00:03] <yates> bpalmer: so if i want to interleave notes in an \itemize of the actual presentation text? 
[04:00:05] <johnjay> right
[04:00:20] <johnjay> if i want to run gdb can i just use a shell then instead of a full term?
[04:00:27] <bpalmer> yates: these are just speaker notes, right?
[04:00:36] <yates> yes
[04:01:04] <yates> subwoofer notes, to be exact. ha ha ha ...........
[04:01:05] <bpalmer> For me, I just maybe have at the beginning part of each "after item 1", "mention after item 2", ...

[05:09:12] <grym> used to drive by it fairly regularly 
[05:09:20] <johnjay> sometimes a big powerful man in a suit and smoking a cigar makes a decision
[05:09:27] <johnjay> then everyone has to live with that decision for a hundred years

[05:10:14] <skangas> grym: The idea is to change the default before release such that the warning buffer you see no longer pops up.
[05:10:23] <johnjay> maybe i'm naive. but i just realized the benefit of M-x shell is I can search the output buffer with emacs commands

[10:25:59] <johnjay> or you mean like. just having regex at all
[10:26:17] <wasamasa> the specific flavor of how regex is used from an elisp program
[10:26:48] <wasamasa> in most languages you don't have the pattern of a global match object you have to immediately invoke a match extraction function afterwards
[10:27:28] <johnjay> true
[10:27:46] <johnjay> elisp does rely on some very specific stuff from the C layer
[10:27:48] <wasamasa> instead the API is designed differently, where a match object is returned and you invoke functions on it
[10:27:52] <johnjay> networking i guess also
[10:28:46] <johnjay> bug-compatibility = get the same bugs as in the old code?

[11:14:34] <piyo> JibStyle: I copied libgnutls-32, libnettle-8 and libhogweed-6.dll from 28... to 27.2 and now url-r-s "https://www.gnu.org" works. huh
[11:14:56] <edrx> twb: hm, not in this case... at least my unzip doesn't recognize it. "UnZip 6.00 of 20 April 2009, by Debian. Original by Info-ZIP."
[11:14:57] <piyo> correction, libgnutls-30.dll
[11:15:24] <JibStyle> piyo: What does `libgnutls-version' in Emacs report for you?
[11:15:53] <piyo> in the modified 27.2, it reports 30615, just like the unmodified 27.2

[11:17:03] <JibStyle> Ok, and your unmodified 27.2 failed url-r-s "https://www.gnu.org" ?
[11:17:11] <piyo> Not sure how to check the version of a msys2-provided dll file. normal windows metadata does not seem to be set.
[11:17:20] <piyo> JibStyle: yes, as reported before
[11:18:15] <JibStyle> Ok. Well I'm still stuck with gnutls 3.6.9, so I think I'm a step behind you.

[11:19:13] <JibStyle> I will try and write the Cygwin maintainers about getting a new GnuTLS version in there. If that fails, I may try compiling Emacs myself against a newer GnuTLS.
[11:19:32] <piyo> sounds right
[11:20:26] <piyo> maybe you can just compile a newer gnutls and drop that copy into pre-built emacs, just like my experiment with copying dlls shows.
[11:21:39] <piyo> but you did say that Emacs on Windows (official) 27.2 does work

[11:22:19] <edrx> (ploft)
[11:22:54] <JibStyle> Yes, for me, GNU Emacs 27.2 for Windows does work. Strange that it conflicts with your finding.
[11:23:07] <andreyorst> was building emacs28 branch today and got "emacs/src/comp.c:725: undefined reference to `md5_stream'". Does anyone know what lib do I miss? Searching for error shows little to no results

[11:34:12] <piyo> and copying the same files to EoW 27.1 fixes the problem, even though libgnutls-version reports 30612. huh. the libgnutls-version variable just reports which gnutls version was available at compile time, I think. surreptitiously copying dll files fools the Emacs on Windows. shrug

I gather embark leans on marginalia to categorize. I managed to get projects categorized as file but I can't get the resulting project-find-file categorized.

[16:36:58] <hodapp> linking between org files is still possible and often sensible
[16:37:05] <tyson2> Bayes: that's what works for me.   Having a lot of small files just seems to increase complexity.  I have some files that are quite large and have no issues with them

[16:39:25] <Bayes> tyson2 and I guess that for a long org file, the key is to get used to the whole folding and searching workflow?
[16:39:32] <hodapp> but some tools, e.g. ox-hugo, are opinionated on whether N org files, or N headlines, should render to N pages, or something else
[16:39:49] <hodapp> so sometimes the number of files you use depends on what other tools are expecting
[16:39:51] <tyson2> Bayes: that's right, and good backups are a must
[16:39:58] <tyson2> things do go wrong sometimes
[16:40:29] <Bayes> good backups I think I can do that, I'm used to a more or less reasonable git workflow

[16:42:54] <ShinyRice> so that you can build a coherent written work by stringing each file, containing one concept each, together
[16:43:06] <tyson2> also used the org-mode and emacs cheat sheets
[16:43:37] <tyson2> I only use a subset of the commands, probably not the most efficient, but I like to keep it simple

[18:45:34] <xheimlich> It's surprisingly easy to write inner functions in Rust and integrate them into Python code.
[18:45:58] <xheimlich> I know people do this with C and TCL. Can something like that be done with elisp?

[18:48:08] <wasamasa> I clearly have a different understanding of what an "inner function" is supposed to be
[18:48:11] <wasamasa> like, scheme allows putting them inside each other
[18:48:14] <wasamasa> do you mean writing performance-critical code in another language and exposing it to a higher-level language?
[18:48:17] <wasamasa> that can be done with a module, but at what cost...
[18:48:53] *** Joins: gnufied (~hekumar@75-44-151-71.lightspeed.tukrga.sbcglobal.net)
[18:51:50] <xheimlich> wasamasa: inner function is something costly and performed very often that makes sense to write in an annoying inflexible language.
[18:52:06] <wasamasa> sorry, but your terminology sucks
[18:52:08] <technomancy> I've never heard that terminology before
[18:52:09] <wasamasa> hot loop
[18:52:22] <wasamasa> tight code
[18:52:23] <wasamasa> whatever
[18:52:29] <xheimlich> ok.
[18:52:38] <wasamasa> bottleneck
[18:53:12] <xheimlich> bottleneck is perfect.
[18:53:55] <bremner> inner function is the thing I miss writing common-lisp
[18:53:58] <wasamasa> if your bottleneck in an elisp program is better reimplemented in C, chances are emacs-devel does better in core than you with a module
[18:54:03] <xheimlich> like -- Python is slow but this is mostly irrelevant since there are libraries written in $fast_lang for everything. plus the whole numpy thing which is barely even python.
[18:55:07] <xheimlich> then: I learned over the weekend to use Rust's ndarray facilities and to use quick interop tools. Sometimes a 8X speedup in a toy problem that couldn't be hammered into numpy idioms.
[18:55:43] <xheimlich> what they say about Rust error messages is true, particularly if you have a buffer running `cargo check` constantly.

[20:56:47] <johnjay> libgccjit isn't in arch?
[20:56:56] <artefact> it's in the aur. and it's a pain to compile (takes a while)

[20:57:31] <johnjay> i don't even ask that it run.
[20:57:50] <artefact> it took me a couple of weeks to realise that it requires -o exec on /tmp, or the library will not work
