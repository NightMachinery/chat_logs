[10:15:32] <DunceCotus> right

[10:15:49] <DunceCotus> but other modes/options too

[10:16:42] <DunceCotus> this ties into the very structure of the Real (plane of immanence)

[11:44:54] <Nanobot> Sora, Roboco, Miko, Suisei, and AZKi are considered Hololive gen 0.
[11:45:06] <amigojapan> I see
[11:45:23] <Sapphirus> I still don't understand Hololive. 
[11:45:32] <Nanobot> Of gen 0, I think Suisei is the only one to have a 2D model. She drew her own model originally.

[11:54:22] <Nanobot> Sapphirus: If you don't get the appeal of streamers in general, you probably won't get the appeal of Hololive. It's basically a talent agency for streamers. They seek out talented people, hook them up with avatars, and give them a platform and ecosystem for streaming and creating extra content (like original songs, or whatever they want to do). It started in Japan, and most of the streamers are what could be described as otaku.

[15:39:39] <Cryowolf> it feels just like wired
[15:39:43] <Bco1981> no wireless
[15:39:50] <Cryowolf> trust me on this
[15:39:57] <Cryowolf> this wireless is the exact same as wired
[15:39:57] <Bco1981> no batteries... no wireless
[15:40:11] <Cryowolf> it has its own battery
[15:40:16] <Cryowolf> charges fast and lasts a long time
[15:40:37] <Cryowolf> and you can just connect the wireless dongle/charge adapter cable directly to the mouse
[15:40:38] <Bco1981> i don't wanna deal with charging or changing batteries... no wireless for me.
[15:40:43] <Cryowolf> and it will be wired and charging
[15:40:58] <Cryowolf> dude, it will make no difference if you charge it while it's wired
[15:41:15] <Cryowolf> you literally make it into a wired mouse while charging it

[15:41:34] <Cryowolf> no

[15:42:45] <Cryowolf> with its own battery
[15:43:00] <Cryowolf> no sorry 74 grams

[15:45:47] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, Razer Viper Ultimate weighs 74 grams (with its built in battery) and can be charged using either the wireless dongle or the paracord cable (it's one of those shoestring cables that can be bent in any way, doesnt get in the way) connected to the mouse. This turns the mouse from wireless into wired and will charge it. A bit slower t han the dongle, but still charge it. The mouse lasts me from 100% to 0% while in full use, 
[15:45:47] <Cryowolf> about 15-20 hours
[15:46:00] <Cryowolf> charges from 0 to 100 in less than an hour
[15:46:06] <senti> what,is Bco1981 here?
[15:46:12] <Bco1981> yeah
[15:46:20] <Cryowolf> it's ambidexterous, feels a little bit like intellimouse

[15:47:26] <senti> also, I'm not god. I'm a dumb drunk, sorry
[15:47:28] <Cryowolf> senti, I just don't understand, can you remind me why you thought that way?
[15:47:40] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: they talk all about performance, but nothing about ergonomics. i'm not 16 any more, i want some that is also something i can curve my hand around for hours and not feel like my hand hurts.
[15:47:55] <senti> Cryowolf: I was worried on your behalf
[15:48:07] <senti> but I don't know these things so well
[15:48:16] <senti> I guess I was wrong?
[15:48:26] <Cryowolf> I like the ergonomics can I can switch between finger and hand grip Bco1981. If you want something with an even better grip, there's the basilisk but it 's a little heavier
[15:48:57] <Cryowolf> basilisk ultimate
[15:49:05] <youloveme> why must it be so light?
[15:49:07] <Cryowolf> then there's also the deathadder v2 pro
[15:49:12] <senti> Cryowolf: I trust your judgement.
[15:49:19] <Cryowolf> youloveme, easier for first person shooters
[15:49:25] <senti> also, sorry I knocked you earlier, bro
[15:49:36] <youloveme> what? it's not nice to shoot people
[15:49:41] <Cryowolf> senti,  worried how? I don't get it

[15:50:38] <senti> that's true!
[15:50:41] <Bco1981> youloveme: that's why you have a cord on it... so it doesn't run away
[15:50:48] <youloveme> thinking about it, maybe more like a rat than a mouse

[15:51:06] <Cryowolf> and it replaces a mattress that's 30 years old and hurts my body
[15:51:21] <senti> Cryowolf: I thought about it a lot. I realize, you are making a huge improvement. I am wrong to say terrible words as I did.
[15:51:23] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, both the basilisk and viper can be charged using the cable or dongle
[15:51:36] <Cryowolf> senti, it's fine, don't worry about it
[15:52:03] <senti> Cryowolf: much love, please accept my apology and be my brother
[15:52:04] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, basilisk weighs 107grams though
[15:52:39] <senti> Bco1981: I want music!
[15:52:59] <Cryowolf> senti, I accept your apology. But you know what's making you constantly go on these rants and attacks don't you?
[15:52:59] <youloveme> you want a musical mouse?

[15:53:25] <senti> Cryowolf: I drink too much?
[15:53:43] <Cryowolf> senti, yes, you're letting the alcohol control you
[15:53:48] <senti> also, thanks man. You are too kind to forgive me
[15:53:57] <senti> you're right
[15:54:15] <senti> Cryowolf: it's hard to change
[15:54:46] <Cryowolf> giving away power over yourself and life. To me that has been there, except with narcotics. Now that I've got cancer and I look at how many years I wasted.  It makes me loathe my past self
[15:54:55] <Cryowolf> and those years I'll never get back
[15:55:09] <senti> you have cancer?
[15:55:13] <Cryowolf> and if I die soon, I will have wasted a third of my life just being high
[15:55:17] <Cryowolf> yeah
[15:55:17] <senti> Mate, that sucks!
[15:55:33] <senti> Gods, Cryo  bro
[15:55:46] <senti> I'm pissed, why no
[15:55:46] <Cryowolf> thats the whole point of why Im getting a new mattress that's designed to alleviate pain
[15:55:47] <senti> nooooooo
[15:56:09] <senti> man, I'd help you if I had the power
[15:56:25] <senti> damn it, you don't deserve this
[15:56:41] <senti> you're a good guy, Cryowolf
[15:56:46] <Cryowolf> and I'm telling you from my perspective. Wasting your life on a drug or drink, letting it have power over you and throwing away time. It's horrible
[15:57:03] <senti> yeah, it's hard to stop man
[15:57:16] <senti> I know it's wrong, but I can't easily stop
[15:57:20] <Cryowolf> I know, I used to be a drig aniser
[15:57:25] <Cryowolf> drug abuser
[15:57:35] <Cryowolf> I would be high 24/7, I stopped
[15:57:53] <senti> how'd you put it down? 
[15:58:00] <Cryowolf> was clean 2 years, not a single time did I go back to it
[15:58:09] <Cryowolf> there were temptations, but I always said no
[15:58:18] <senti> how did you do it???
[15:58:20] <Cryowolf> then I got cancer and I had to go on painkillers anyway
[15:58:44] <Cryowolf> I decided one day that it's harming me, that so many y ears have gone by and I have no new memories really
[15:58:51] <Cryowolf> cause every day blended together into the same
[15:59:07] <Cryowolf> I hated myself so much that if I met myself, I would beat the shit out of that guy
[15:59:13] <senti> that resonates with what's happening to me!
[15:59:21] <Cryowolf> I hated myself more than anything or anyone
[15:59:29] <Cryowolf> and I couldn't live with that or accept that
[15:59:35] <Cryowolf> so I quit
[15:59:55] <senti> I see
[16:00:09] <Cryowolf> I said "That's enough" and got through the withdrawal, then I started going to the gym
[16:00:32] <senti> you have introduced me, a pathway I didn't know about. I path of change.
[16:00:35] <Cryowolf> and going to the gym worked to help curb the temptations
[16:00:52] <Cryowolf> but with alcohol you need professional medical help to quit
[16:00:58] <Cryowolf> because it's dangerous to just outright stop
[16:01:12] <senti> well, I'm not that far in it
[16:01:15] <Cryowolf> and unless you're willing to quit, really willing to do it
[16:01:23] <senti> I don't actually get withdrawal yet
[16:01:28] <Cryowolf> then dont waste their time
[16:01:35] <senti> but I have been to the hospital a lot
[16:01:46] <Cryowolf> are you sure about that? it can take 1-2 days to get withdrawal
[16:01:51] <Cryowolf> or a little more
[16:02:03] <senti> not really sure, tbh
[16:02:40] <senti> I get a lot of muscle spasms, is that a normal thing? 
[16:02:50] <hassoon>  dooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooods
[16:03:21] <Cryowolf> senti, that means you need medical help to quit
[16:03:30] * senti spears hassoon
[16:03:41] <senti> Cryowolf: you may be right
[16:04:21] <Cryowolf> there are clinics that help you, they give you medicine to take care of withdrawal effects. Anti-nausea to minimize sickness, muscle relaxants to stop seizure risk
[16:04:32] <Cryowolf> maybe antianxiety and stuff
[16:05:01] <Cryowolf> but unless you're 100% sure you want to quit and stay off it, don't waste their time when they could take in someone who is 100% sure
[16:07:06] <Cryowolf> I managed to quit on my own because I have quite a bit of pharmacutical knowledge when it came to opiates and stuff. But with alcohol, it's the sameas with benzodiazepines. Quitting on your own can be deadly
[16:14:03] <Cryowolf> senti, so when you are ready, really ready. Go get help at a clinic
[16:14:08] <Cryowolf> they're not gonna judge you
[16:14:12] <Cryowolf> they'll help
[16:14:51] <Cryowolf> when I got cancer I gained many new perspectives on life, one of them being just how important time is, what you use it for and that it matters
[16:15:18] <senti> maybe so
[16:15:31] <senti> I don't want go though
[16:15:50] <Cryowolf> if you dont want to quit, nothing I say can make you
[16:16:01] <senti> not about not wanting to quit
[16:16:04] <Cryowolf> and you shouldn't take a spot from someone who is actually willing and wanting to quit
[16:16:12] <senti> I just don't want to go to a clinic
[16:16:41] <senti> you act as though a clinic is the only way to quit
[16:16:46] <senti> you're pissing me off!
[16:17:07] <senti> fuck off please
[16:17:11] <Cryowolf> I'm speaking with knowledge of how dangerous cold turkey withdrawal on alcohol is
[16:17:22] <Cryowolf> it can be deadly
[16:17:24] <senti> you don't know me
[16:17:25] <Cryowolf> it could kill you
[16:17:30] <senti> I won't die
[16:18:11] <Cryowolf> dude fine, like I said, time is valuable and I'm not gonna waste what little I might have left on someone who's gonna cuss me out for trying to help them
[16:18:14] <senti> honestly, You're trying to help me. so I forgive you.

[17:37:00] <TsundereNoises> but seriously, everything about it is bad other than Raphtalia being cute

[17:41:55] <Cryowolf> amigojapan,if you havent seen Overlord yet, it's pretty good but the adaptation lacks in many areas. Especially in the art, often resorting to 3d. What I like about it though is how brutal it is, but within reason that makes sense and his "OPness" also makes sense if you look at the story from the perspective it kinda wants you to
[17:42:16] <TsundereNoises> yeah I got distracted in season 2 and didn't come back yet
[17:42:23] <TsundereNoises> but seemed like it had some of the stuff amigo tends to like

[17:43:11] <Cryowolf> Urchin[emacs], that dialogue is just there for the sake of a cliffhanger. But she does mean it, cause the world is under threat and theyre bickering like children so someone that's hundreds of years old sees "heroes" fighting each other instead of whats trying to destroy the world and the only way to get new heroes summoned is for the old ones to die
[17:43:11] <TsundereNoises> the problem is how it impacts the actual stakes of the story
[17:43:16] <TsundereNoises> that said, Overlord is okay
[17:43:22] <Cryowolf> Urchin[emacs], so logically...she has to kill them then
[17:43:46] <Cryowolf> TsundereNoises, in Overlord you're watching it from the powerful villains perspective
[17:43:53] <Cryowolf> the protagonist is the villain of the story
[17:44:09] <Cryowolf> so of course he has to be powerful
[17:44:16] <TsundereNoises> yeah but Ainz is the most boring character in ovelord, which is my point

[17:44:49] <Cryowolf> I forgot his name....but that boy knight. He's the most boring one
[17:45:20] <Cryowolf> Overlord isnt like Mushoku though so it doesnt mean youll like Overlord
[17:45:29] <Cryowolf> doesnt mean you wont either

[17:45:54] <Urchin[emacs]> I've seen Overlord, even read some of the light novels, but dropped it when they started teasing a character that's powerful enough to beat Ainz, but they set her up as a waifu, so that was obviously going nowhere fast

[17:46:55] <TsundereNoises> I'm not sure which if any of those you'd like, I'm trying to remember them in more detail
[17:47:03] <TsundereNoises> but I feel like they're a different subgenre of isekai

[17:47:13] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: tomako is asking me why everyone is reconnecting isekai
[17:47:16] <Cryowolf> but if you want to watch a story about someone that's slowly losing his humanity and becoming a v illain. Overlord fits that. He is very powerful, he's a conquerer, he's ruthless and much of the anime is about him either trying to learn about the world or conquering it. So if you don't like that. Don't watch Overlord
[17:47:20] <Urchin[emacs]> amigojapan: at least the light novel is well ahead in Japanese
[17:47:22] <TsundereNoises> Endro and Bofuri aren't really isekai, but fantasy world so whatever
[17:47:49] <Urchin[emacs]> TsundereNoises: virtual world isekai still counts as isekai, afaik, so bofuri counts
[17:48:04] <Urchin[emacs]> TsundereNoises: also, Endro is kind of isekai of itself
[17:48:16] <TsundereNoises> I would enjoy Overlord a lot more if it really WERE some deep character study about a man losing his humanity
[17:48:25] <Cryowolf> Kenja no Mago is one Isekai I enjoyed but I'm aware it's trash

[17:49:38] *** Quits: flynn (~mcbloch@user/flynn) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[17:49:47] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, Kenja no Mago is about someone that dies and is "Isekai'd" to another world where he's born and raised. The thing they made that I found was a little different is that he uses "science" to make magic
[17:50:14] <Cryowolf> since magic works on visualization and such, he can create a spell from the understanding of what makes fire and such
[17:50:14] *** Joins: flynn (~mcbloch@user/flynn)
[17:50:25] <Cryowolf> and make it more powerful than a regular mage that just th inks "fire"
[17:50:48] <Urchin[emacs]> but that's not the important part
[17:50:49] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: that may be complex for tomako. That is why I did not have her watch Dr stone
[17:50:53] <Cryowolf> that's one thing I liked about it. It's that it explained one of the most important aspects of why he's more powerful
[17:51:09] <Cryowolf> ok but you can watch it
[17:51:32] <amigojapan> Ok. But we have been watching anime together lately
[17:51:38] <Urchin[emacs]> amigojapan: Kenja no Mago is essentially brainless entertainment, not pseudo-educational like Dr. Stone
[17:51:44] <Cryowolf> I mean...it's not like she has to watch everything you watch and do everthing you do all the time
[17:51:54] <Cryowolf> Urchin[emacs], yeah but it's fun

[17:56:03] <TsundereNoises> idiot-plotting all the way
[17:56:06] <Cryowolf> I didn't see it as propaganda
[17:56:11] <Cryowolf> I thoroughly enjoyed it
[17:56:21] <Cryowolf> and now I want to rewatch it, damn
[17:56:58] <Urchin[emacs]> I find that I've forgotten most of GATE
[17:57:13] <Urchin[emacs]> I guess that makes it forgettable :P
[17:57:33] <Cryowolf> oor you were distracted or on weed while watching it
[17:57:42] <Urchin[emacs]> I barely even remember what the goth girl looked like
[17:57:50] <Cryowolf> I remember most of it
[17:57:51] <Urchin[emacs]> Cryowolf: I don't do drugs
[17:58:25] <Cryowolf> I like it. Doesn't make me want to join the Japanese military
[17:58:30] <Urchin[emacs]> R-something was her name
[17:58:49] <Cryowolf> I dont usually remember character names
[17:59:11] <Cryowolf> I might remember them  if Ivve rewatched somethin or watched recently
[18:00:32] <Cryowolf> I want more Isekai that feature maybe more ordinary people that arrive in another world
[18:01:13] <Cryowolf> but maybe their knowledge in modern technology and such will give them a bigger chance
[18:01:24] <theholyduck> Cryowolf:  honestly. are you like high or something? you are reccomending people watch gate?
[18:01:31] <theholyduck> wtf man
[18:01:33] <Urchin[emacs]> Cryowolf: Bookworm
[18:02:06] <Cryowolf> I'm not high but I am on painkillers, like I've been for a long time now
[18:02:22] <Cryowolf> they dont make me high :p
[18:02:39] <theholyduck> Cryowolf: just saying. GATE is like part rape fantasy. part the worst power fantasy bullshit i have ever returned to
[18:02:42] <Cryowolf> if I gave this dose to you though you'd be OD'd maybe
[18:02:46] <theholyduck> and part fellating the JDF
[18:02:55] <Cryowolf> rape fantasy?
[18:03:06] <theholyduck> theres SO much rape in it
[18:03:15] <theholyduck> explicit and implicit
[18:03:21] <Cryowolf> No there isn't, at least not the anime
[18:03:25] <theholyduck> there is
[18:03:29] <Cryowolf> no
[18:03:34] <theholyduck> Cryowolf:  there really is
[18:03:52] <theholyduck> they rescue rape victims like MULTIPLE times. 
[18:03:53] <Cryowolf> I haven't seen any of it.. The only I saw was the bunnygirl slave
[18:04:09] <Cryowolf> yes in that arc they do
[18:04:09] <theholyduck> + yeah the bunnygirl stuff is the explicit one
[18:04:15] <Urchin[emacs]> theholyduck: as long as it's less than in SAO...
[18:04:18] <Urchin[emacs]> I guess
[18:04:31] <Cryowolf> there's a difference between one story arc having it
[18:04:33] <Cryowolf> and ALL THE TIME
[18:04:49] <theholyduck> Cryowolf:  in my head multiple story arc featured women who got assaulted and or being rescued
[18:04:50] <Cryowolf> going to fight a dragon isn't rape
[18:04:54] <theholyduck> after being kidnapped from japan
[18:05:04] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Love Live! (Shin Series Project) | Episode: 5
[18:05:08] <theholyduck> like its mostly just implicit
[18:05:12] <Cryowolf> I think you might be mixing it up with SAO
[18:05:18] <Cryowolf> or Redo Healer
[18:05:20] <TsundereNoises> theholyduck: I mean, Cryowolf also loves Shield Hero
[18:05:23] <theholyduck> no SAO all thevillains are rapists. 
[18:05:27] <Cryowolf> TsundereNoises, yes I do
[18:05:39] <Urchin[emacs]> theholyduck: TsundereNoises has a good point
[18:05:40] <Cryowolf> SAO villains are lazy
[18:05:54] <theholyduck> i dont think i saw shield hero. 
[18:06:06] <theholyduck> but looking ath the promotional stuff it looks like trash
[18:06:33] <Cryowolf> if youre implying that I watch anime for rape and not as a joke but you're serious...Then you must've been dropped on your head asa baby
[18:06:55] <Urchin[emacs]> SAO could have been improved by being more hackneyed
[18:07:10] <theholyduck> Cryowolf:  im just saying. its a decently big part of GATE the other parts being the worst power fantasy bullshit ever
[18:07:13] <Cryowolf> Urchin[emacs], and by building up the villains
[18:07:18] <theholyduck> and JDF porn
[18:07:24] <TsundereNoises> theholyduck: you'd like it, it's a very rapey isekai with bad plotting and a protagonist that everyone bends over to be mean to for dumb reasons
[18:07:39] <Urchin[emacs]> like, Kirito's revival would have been better done by the guy who had the item that Kirito got from slaying Santa after his gf got killed for him fucking up
[18:07:44] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: no, I'm not implying anything about you watching anime for rape
[18:07:59] <Cryowolf> TsundereNoises, do you know the reason or are you just saying "dumb" cause you dont know?
[18:08:02] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: I AM implying it doesn't bother you, and that there's kind of a common asthetic between many of the shows you've been talking about
[18:08:13] <Urchin[emacs]> that would have been a neat bit of irony, and also a good reason for Santa to die
[18:08:17] <Cryowolf> yeah it doesnt bother me, it's fiction

[18:09:30] <Cryowolf> if bad things happening in fiction bothered me then I'd have very little to watch

[18:10:08] <Cryowolf> wow, you guys are very very passionate about this
[18:10:09] <theholyduck> or going to akihabara
[18:10:10] <Cryowolf> holy shit
[18:10:12] <TsundereNoises> I don't actually have a problem with bad things happening, horror is one of my favorite genres
[18:10:42] <theholyduck> im mostly just very passionate about GATE being the worst
[18:11:02] <Cryowolf> I like GATE, that's it. I enjoyed watching it,. I don't need more reason than that

[18:14:31] <Cryowolf> theholyduck, you still acted like a crazy person :P
[18:14:43] <TsundereNoises> theholyduck: is a crazy person, but in this he is correct
[18:15:18] <Cryowolf> It might be all of those things, a power fantasy, some whatever propaganda, it might have lots of implicit rape in it
[18:15:20] <TsundereNoises> theholyduck is like a person with rabies that has several good opinions
[18:15:25] <Cryowolf> but I still liked it
[18:15:34] <Cryowolf> I can't say I like it more than re: zero etc

[18:21:33] <Cryowolf> so when I say that I'm waiting with anticipation for Arufureta season 2, are you gonna go insane? Season 1 did piss me off because they had an opportunity to make a really fun Isekai but instead they wasted half their budget on something th at was discarded by the LN Author after vetoing it. So then they had half the budget to spend on the entire season
[18:21:34] <Urchin[emacs]> I rather liked slime and spider
[18:21:54] <Cryowolf> some of it was good, but the adaptation was so often bad
[18:22:03] <Cryowolf> but it hadthe potential to be so much more
[18:22:07] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: I won't go insane, I'll just say that you're crazy for anticipating such forgettable trash

[18:30:44] <Cryowolf> takes place in the FATE universe
[18:30:55] <theholyduck> how about something with a ton of action 
[18:31:00] <theholyduck> Black Lagoon
[18:31:02] <Cryowolf> it's like the Sherlock Holmes of magic
[18:31:10] <Cryowolf> and it's pretty good
[18:31:47] <treeman5> ty
[18:32:30] <Cryowolf> otherwise Fate/Apocrypha is a great alternate universe FATE if you're in it for fights and action. But the main universe for FATE hast he best FATE anime of all time.

[18:32:41] <Cryowolf> there's no better Fate than UBW
[18:32:42] <TsundereNoises> treeman5: Dororo
[18:33:00] <Cryowolf> even TsundereNoises cant argue against this
[18:33:40] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: maybe I should try my hand at writing a novel about someone that is recorded as a wild animal but make it dark and gritty
[18:33:48] <Cryowolf> but inanime, dark fantasy tends to lean towards the cruel, sad and stuff like that
[18:34:00] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: I believe I am contractually bound to disagree and insist that Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya is the best
[18:34:03] <Cryowolf> so if youre trying to escape something bad IRL, perhaps best to av oid things that remind it
[18:34:22] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: „ÉÑ„É≥„Éá„É¨„Éé„Ç§„Çº„Çπ
[18:34:43] <Cryowolf> Zeppelin is good fun though

[18:35:33] <Urchin[emacs]> I dropped Fate/Apocrypha, boredom
[18:35:52] <Cryowolf> Urchin[emacs], too bad, you missed a lot in the second half
[18:36:03] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: that's noise not noises
[18:36:25] <Urchin[emacs]> Cryowolf: dropped it 16 episodes in
[18:36:32] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yeah I know, I'm saying my brain was fixated on it
[18:36:45] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: rather than just sounding things out
[18:36:54] <Cryowolf> Urchin[emacs], had the big boss summoned the big floaty thing?
[18:36:54] <Urchin[emacs]> Cryowolf: seems that I drop stuff  you like 16 episodes in
[18:37:06] <amigojapan> I see TsundereNoises 
[18:37:16] <Cryowolf> or well taken off in it
[18:37:20] <Urchin[emacs]> Cryowolf: you mean the hanging gardens? ages ago
[18:37:25] <Cryowolf> ah
[18:37:39] <Cryowolf> treeman5, here's something you can do. Watch Hunter X Hunter (2011 version)
[18:37:46] <Cryowolf> it's great fun
[18:37:56] <Cryowolf> it has dark and light moments
[18:38:27] <Cryowolf> and its very well done
[18:38:33] <Cryowolf> or Attack on Titan
[18:38:55] <Urchin[emacs]> Attack on Titan is just dark
[18:39:10] <Urchin[emacs]> should I mention I dropped it due to disinterest
[18:39:11] <Cryowolf> now that all seasons are out imma get them all and watch it. Please dont spoil I never finished manga
[18:39:20] <SpiritOfSummer> attack on titan shocks you
[18:39:32] <SpiritOfSummer> god I want to say the most shocking line but it is a monstrosity of a spoiler. 
[18:39:51] <Cryowolf> the anime is 3 seasons right? or is it 4?
[18:39:56] <SpiritOfSummer> they're on the 4th
[18:40:02] <Cryowolf> SpiritOfSummer, dont spoil please

[22:30:25] <Nanobot> If you're buying bitcoin and plan to hold it for a while, I'd say right now is a relatively risky time. We're just about at an OTE short zone. You'd typically want to buy in a major OTE long zone, which is the opposite.
