[00:57:07] <Codaraxis> I'm trying to use Starfish shell (with Bash) and am loving it except for one detail: it doesn't seem to have a way to list the history number. I don't suppose there's an environment variable that holds the history number? I was trying to use $(history 1 | cut -d " " -f 3), but when executed by the prompt, history 1 doesn't return anything.

[03:21:54] <ednash> the motivation for mounting in /tmp/ is so that the directory gets cleaned up as tmpfs remounts next reboot
[03:22:11] <ednash> i actually mounted a bitlocker windows drive there, worked as far as i can tell
[03:22:17] <Dan39> why does it need to get clanead up/

[03:22:21] <ednash> clutter
[03:22:50] <Dan39> i mean, if it's a common mount just have a directory name you use every time?
[03:23:01] <ednash> don't want a lot of subdirs hanging around in /mnt/, /mnt/testing, /mnt/bitlocker, /mnt/ntfs, /mnt/external_hdd, etc.
[03:23:06] <ednash> oh
[03:23:18] <ednash> well i have multiple disks that i mount on demand
[03:23:21] <ednash> sometimes together
[03:23:36] <Dan39> to each their own
[03:23:51] <ednash> e.g. for backup into an internal drive dedicated for it, then a windows drive, and a drive from another linux partition, and external drive etc.

[03:24:17] <ednash> they can all be mounted simultaneously in theory
[03:25:16] <ednash> i am just concerned if there will any side effects (e.g. some part of the system i don't know wants to clean up /tmp)
[03:25:30] <ednash> (and in the process wipes real data mounted there)
[03:25:39] <ednash> nightmare fuel
[03:25:43] <Dan39> heh
[03:26:12] <Dan39> i would just have the directories under /mnt that i need to have them all mounted
[03:26:31] <Dan39> it's going to be clutter in /tmp once you have to mount them all at the same time, same as if in /mnt
[03:26:37] <Dan39> but like i said, to each their own
[03:26:44] <uwharrie> or use a .mount unit so the directory will get auto-created to mount on and auto-removed when unmounted
[03:26:49] <Dan39> i very highly doubt anything would delete your data from t/mp
[03:26:50] <ednash> but /tmp gets cleaned up on reboot
[03:26:56] <ednash> it's usually a ramdrive
[03:26:59] <Khaytsus> I would not mount stuff in /tmp no, that seems dumb
[03:27:16] <Khaytsus> And why would yuo care if there are paths in /mnt hneh

[03:27:17] <uwharrie> I'd make real sure you didn't have tmpwatch or similar installed
[03:27:34] <tpefreedom> what's tmpwatch?
[03:27:44] <ednash> "tmpwatch recursively removes files which haven't been accessed for a given time"
[03:27:46] <ednash> ohh god!

[03:27:52] <Khaytsus> Period.
[03:28:00] <Dan39> yeah seems silly to mount under /tmp
[03:28:14] <ednash> i mounted the bitlocker / ntfs on /tmp, thankfully on -r mode
[03:28:14] <Dan39> if tmpwatch crosses filesystems then that shit should just be wiped from the internet haha
[03:28:52] <ednash> yeah it seems dumb to mount on /tmp
[03:29:03] <Khaytsus> Users mounting stuff under /tmp should also bew iped from the internet ;)
[03:29:20] <ednash> may be i will rely on scripts to clean up /mnt, e.g. backup.sh creates, mounts, backs up, unmounts, unlinks
[03:29:44] <Dan39> ednash: i mean you were just given an option for systemd to do that in a cleaner fashion :P

[05:16:12] <Guest8133> no

[09:09:48] <NeoFAT32> [16:32:09] <NeoFAT32> For my fake usb drive, I used f3probe/fix and then found out it has 31Gb usable instead of 2Tb.
[09:09:48] <NeoFAT32> [16:32:26] <NeoFAT32> It made a partition for the usable side.
[09:09:48] <NeoFAT32> [16:33:09] <NeoFAT32> But when I use the "disk manager" it's showing 2 partitions, the 21Gb usable one and the rest, is free space.
[09:09:49] <NeoFAT32> [16:34:49] <NeoFAT32> How can I reconfigure the key to make it only show the usable part ? and make it permanent so when I will use any programs such a boot key maker, it doesn't erase all partitions to use both, usable part and fake space ?
[09:09:53] <NeoFAT32> [16:35:36] <NeoFAT32> it will not erase*

[10:44:10] <Bogdan> Hi everyone! I own a BeagleBone AI, and the operating system runs on the eMMC. Storage is limited to only 15GB. In this sense I want to add a cardSD that I can use only for additional storage space, without running the operating system on it, but I don’t know how to do that.

[16:07:36] <DX099> Can someone explain how the grub stage 1 knows where the /boot partition is?
[16:07:37] <tirnanog> yeah. I mean, the good thing about pam_env was that it tended to work. less so now. and it's useless if you want to affect variables with shell code anyway.
[16:08:10] <phogg> tirnanog: there's an argument to be made that allowing shell code is insane anyway
[16:08:25] <phogg> the counter argument being that it's that OR accept that people will generate config files (probably using shell code)
[16:08:36] <phogg> DX099: magic!

[19:23:39] <akk> tirnanog: With en_US.UTF-8, yes, case isn't ignored, but it isn't used as the first search parameter, all a and A files are grouped together before b or B
[19:23:39] <tirnanog> that's not what case-insensitivity means.

[23:26:10] <HyP3r> I'm searching a simple web interface for database editing like adminer and phpmyadmin. phpmyadmin is not compatible to mssql and adminer is dead: https://github.com/vrana/adminer (last commit 23.05.2021).

[23:26:32] <HyP3r> Some of my non-it co-workers need to edit something in the database
[23:26:44] <memelover> Is there any way that I could read _existing_ lines in a file with syslog-ng? My goal would be for it to read all existing lines, then tail. https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/5-syslog-ng.conf/
