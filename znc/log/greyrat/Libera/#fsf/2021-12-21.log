[02:19:06] <epony> I think you advocate the rights of the software distribution as a service model.
[02:19:32] <epony> but the point I raised is another
[02:19:44] <epony> "limitations" and "discrimination"
[02:20:32] <epony> which is what IRC networks do, enforcing opinions of the moderation and middle man in the discussion
[02:20:42] <epony> and that is also what licenses and policy does too
[02:21:10] <epony> so, why should we believe you advocate any freedom or liberty, if the practical result is something else..
[02:21:39] <epony> to be fair, this channel has not been discriminatory and offensive ;-)

[02:38:26] <ffguest> I want to give up proprietary software, and there has already been success.
[02:38:26] <epony> they said "WE DO NOT APPOINT MODERATORS" and then silence you.. what?
[02:39:09] <epony> ffguest, that's approachable and easy thing to do 25 years after the commercial internet

[02:40:51] <epony> ah, well, yeah, the embedded and handheld markets are a disaster
[02:42:10] <ffguest> This is disgusting, ios is not open source, and sends all your data to servers.
[02:42:17] <epony> yep
[02:42:49] <epony> the "utility" computing model is bad and damaging to your independence and sustainable computing
[02:43:46] <ffguest> What do you think about Gentoo Linux?
[02:43:52] <epony> it is a net negative effect on humanity, mostly because of greed and built-in injustice and lack of government and regulatory intercepts to defend that it is a given right (information access and computing)
[02:44:44] <epony> I think all UNIX-like bundling systems are useful but they are not as efficient and independent as they could be
[02:45:21] <ffguest> Yeah.
[02:45:37] <epony> I would use FreeBSD instead of Gentoo, for I know the benefits of FreeBSD for the tasks that Gentoo tries to solve and present as tooling

[02:46:42] <ffguest> I will definitely try FreeBSD, thanks.
[02:47:00] <epony> each GNU redistributives has some "set of solutions" or 'accents', 'interests' and 'tooling' but not all of them being "standard" compliant in the file system, package management and interfaces
[02:48:02] <epony> so, are "themed" and "nuanced" packages (bundles) of the same, with different minimal tooling of their own, and some take on a UNIX idea half-implemented half-overbuilt
[02:49:43] <epony> by all means, read what FSF will instruct you on their directory and pages of "good and bad" about distributions and application environments
[02:50:19] <epony> but in reality, you should seek a robust and long standing uniform standards compliant Unix-like system that has useful application rebuild infrastructure
[02:50:34] <ffguest> Okay, im read it.
[02:50:49] <epony> this what is called a ports tree in the BSD systems and portage / user repositories in the GNU systems
[02:51:33] <epony> the FSF directory however is just an enumeration / listing of that software, not the "tooling to get it compiled / installed / developed"
[02:52:17] <ffguest> Yes, i know.
[02:52:28] <epony> so you need to compare distributions and operating sytems by more criteria, than just "irc community" membershipp
[02:53:00] <epony> in the modern times, as well as in the 80ies, it's always been about application software

[02:54:36] <epony> but "less" applications typically means "smaller system" not "better quality"
[02:55:27] <ffguest> You're right.
[02:55:56] <epony> so, if you compare the ported applications and packages, and that with the "overhead" to manage and operate your system, you get the entire picture (of using it), but not of developing or participating in it (just yet)

[02:58:21] <epony> so, systems in the handheld and embedded segments are entirely closed off, even if they claim otherwise
[02:59:36] <epony> and even systems on free applications platforms are, exclusive and preventing cross platform application sharing, due to deviations in the minimal common standard base (they grab your application and lock it by sheer hosting it or making you target that system without knowing you have to target other systems)

[06:35:16] <epony> yeah.. seems like it repeats the former freenode practices, nothing changed
[06:35:58] <epony> just the ircd/services combo and some rebranding (new logo)
[06:36:28] <epony> what else could it be, new people, new methodologies, new culture..?
[06:37:53] <epony> they said "it's a privilege" so.. not a facilitator, but a privileged and inequality system
[06:39:27] <epony> you join, someone from another network is on this network and out-of-self-appointment, bans you.. cause same people, different IRC network, same actions (trolling and abuse elsewhere, by the object that behaves like he owns IRC in all networks)
[06:39:30] <epony> WTF
[06:39:58] <epony> "libera" is a lie
[06:40:44] <epony> it's freenode ran by speech and freedom suppressive moderators, that are NOT appointed by the network, only happen to be trolls elsewhere and moderators here
[06:40:48] <epony> what a coincidence
[06:40:54] <epony> "staged fiasco"
[06:41:43] <epony> don't care, by the way, but you should know it.
[06:42:35] <epony> cause it's your "statehood" I can eject myself anytime and won't "lose" anything, know how to read books and teach others, you don't so you're affected by this
[06:43:54] <epony> and we saw the "what do you want to happen with FSF hosting its IRC debate" before any move, it just was "we had already decided but thanks for showing up"
[06:44:57] <epony> which is not relevant, only shows you chose the same thing, which is a no change, the change was just "rebranding"
[06:46:03] <epony> therefore the expectations are not very high, and it just demonstrates it carries the baggage and the attitude and restrictive suppressive "disservice"

[06:58:45] <smlavine> Not particularly, so with respect I don't think I will continue this conversation with you
[06:59:16] <epony> cause we can compare data about mental health in your and my region and drugs and narcotics use and alcohol consumption and suicide rates and what not :-) you'll lose 11 out of 10 times
[06:59:45] <epony> (it's not a conversation)
[07:00:21] <epony> I was saying, there are certain patterns you need to know about, and you seem to protest by "attacking the other person"
[07:00:33] <epony> kid stuff ;-)
[07:03:11] <epony> I'd personally defund any project that chooses to give money to organisations like this one (false representation and discrimination / targeted suppression)

And recently, he has been promoting communications platforms that might help extremists to operate beyond the reach of censorship – and even the law.
[10:38:35] <kompowiec> https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/12/far-right-open-source-technology-censorship
[10:38:48] <kompowiec> beautiful narrative /s
[10:41:18] <smlavine> Luke Smith is an alt-right anti-vaxxer, don't lionize him even if he supports FOSS
[10:43:33] <kompowiec> as long as I can remember, I have always had a problem remembering the names and surnames of anyone, so i don't even know this guy, unless it's the one who wrote the article about cuck permissive licenses.
[10:43:49] <GoatAvenger> sounds like something he'd say
[10:43:52] <GoatAvenger> he's weird
[10:44:11] <GoatAvenger> it's too bad people look up to him..
[10:45:07] <GoatAvenger> too bad the guardian wants to give freedom, bad press..
[10:45:25] <kompowiec> as long as people don't change, so doesn't propaganda.
[10:46:40] <GoatAvenger> people were socks, luke smith wears sucks; therefore, socks must be bad
[10:46:45] <GoatAvenger> yay, logic
[10:46:53] <GoatAvenger> wear*
[10:49:34] <kompowiec> as i mentioned above, I don't know the guy so I can only tell in general. For example whataboutism still works, because use mechanism called amoral familism
[10:51:33] <kompowiec> the only good news is if you just rote learn about fallacies and cliches, are easy to spot, like typos in the text.
[10:51:46] <kompowiec> unlike ordinary lies
[10:51:52] <rbraun> luke smith's politics suck, but my reaction to that fucking awful article is basically this, i think: https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8926092fa45332f45f7157027c93a355e8060ff/0_0_2218_1331/master/2218.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2258d7983f2def2cf61033df59ab0c54
[10:53:08] <kompowiec> they don't even hide their intentions.
[10:58:33] <GoatAvenger> luke smith is probably on the payroll
[10:58:46] <GoatAvenger> but it's very unfortunate that an article like that is given any credibility at all

[15:01:50] <DiffieHellman> What does DOS have to do with it?
[15:02:06] <epony> as you talk of binary compat which does not exist with ABI changes
[15:02:10] <DiffieHellman> DOS is a toy compared to decent OS's.
[15:02:27] <epony> DOS is a clone of CP/M which is downstream adaptation (simplified) of UNIX
[15:02:34] <epony> it has EVERYTHING to do with it
[15:02:52] <epony> as DOS/WIN is a CP/M derivative
[15:03:19] <epony> only it made incompatible changes so you have to pay for it.. as other suckers on mobile platforms
[15:03:40] <epony> DOS was a placeholder for UNIX
[15:03:47] <DiffieHellman> Okay, so DOS is derived from Unix, but they stripped out so much functionality DOS is near useless.
[15:04:03] <epony> "a sear warmer" until the CPUs get the MMU and MMIO
[15:04:17] <epony> "seat warmer" disk operating system
[15:04:44] <DiffieHellman> More like "money acquiring operating system"/
[15:04:47] <epony> which tells you, the file system and the process management are the services you get from the OS, and the memory management is just "taken for granted"
[15:05:09] <epony> more like commercial downstream adaptations / immitations / incompatible clones
[15:05:22] <epony> as the low end computers could facilitate
[15:06:11] <DiffieHellman> Sure there were a few DOS's, but MS-DOS was eventually the most widespread thanks to some nice manipulation if I remember correctly.
[15:06:38] <epony> it was a deal with IBM to shaft CP/M vendor DRI
[15:07:09] <DiffieHellman> Of course

[15:13:50] <jrmu> DiffieHellman: Ah...yeah :( that was what I had feared

[15:22:40] <DiffieHellman> Anything recent that's fast needs lots of proprietary software to operate.
[15:22:43] <epony> the branded ones are a problem / risk / have issues with compatibility

[15:25:59] <epony> free computers are ones that you can build yourself from parts that you can choose on your own

[15:26:11] <ffguest_> epony: It's not the battery, it's new, the glue that should hold the screen has come off, and now it falls off.
[15:26:24] <epony> only people who can not choose computers get suckered into the less affordable ones
[15:26:24] <DiffieHellman> You can get laptops that are more free than all modern computers.
[15:26:33] <epony> THAT IS A LIE.
[15:26:51] <epony> laptops are proprietary computer-like appliances

[15:27:36] <DiffieHellman> Separate components are very useful, but it's less useful if you can't get any individual components that are free.

[15:33:31] <epony> FPGAs make very poor general purpose computers

[15:35:14] <epony> because more popular computers are more subjected to scrutiny and standardisation and can be reimplemented easier
[15:35:37] <DiffieHellman> kompowiec: Hacking new hardware is a no-term path to nowhere if a digital signature is stopping you that's not trivial to crack. 
[15:35:50] <epony> remind yourself of the IBM BIOS clones and chip compatible other vendors without agreement or cooperation by IBM and Intel
[15:36:42] <kompowiec> therefore you cannot base on what is, we need to have a replacement in its entirety.
[15:36:56] <epony> the reality is, older processes are not that lucrative and profitable to large vendors so they get lended and leased to lower grade producers and reimplementers
[15:37:32] <DiffieHellman> The only entire replacement is free hardware designs, but getting hardware produced is a pain.
[15:37:39] <epony> that is why arm computers trail chip designs by rought 25-30 years at the start of the century and are only 20 years behind now
[15:37:53] <epony> :roughly:
[15:38:30] <epony> and big business sell off the scraps of their batches to low quality resellers that put them on cheap PCBs
[15:38:40] <DiffieHellman> Certain ARM designs currently beats all AMD64 designs on power efficiency to performance.
[15:38:55] <epony> and you think that is "freedom revolution" while it is charity and boxed litter
[15:39:09] <epony> that is false claim
[15:39:27] <DiffieHellman> I didn't say that ARM is "freedom revolution", but okay.
[15:39:44] <epony> the most efficient chips are defined by calculations for "size" and "throughput" per energy
[15:40:34] <DiffieHellman> Okay, it'll clarify - as general purpose processors, not single purpose ones that are very fast and efficcient.
[15:40:51] <epony> not by "I used smaller features" and sold it in a device that barely calculates enough to show a handheld mirror size of gifs
[15:41:23] <DiffieHellman> ARM is kinda worse than AMD64, as while there's no microcode, ARM delivers an opaque chip to vendors to place into the hardware unquestionably.
[15:41:30] <epony> if arm computers were efficient, they would be the gaming CPUs you get in your fancy shmancy tower
[15:42:08] <epony> while you get an Intel CPU and an nVidia GPU cause that is what Windows runs at fastest
[15:42:16] <DiffieHellman> Ehh, ARM can't get into the whole windows "gaming" scheme thanks to arch compatibility issues.
[15:42:24] <epony> arm can get nowhere
[15:42:51] <epony> because it's Qualcomm and Samsung and Mediatek and Broadcom
[15:42:52] <DiffieHellman> There's no true windows port to ARM, plus no-one will port their proprietary malware from AMD64
[15:43:13] <epony> Arm are not general purpose processors
[15:43:37] <epony> they are small SoC units suitable for embedded and handheld and signage markets
[15:43:39] <DiffieHellman> Intel tried going to Itanium from x86, but every vendor refused to port anything.
[15:43:53] <epony> Intel fails in CPUs more than you know ;-)
[15:44:13] <epony> but the mainline of x86 CPUs is the dominant design for 40 years
[15:44:31] <epony> 44 to be precise
[15:44:53] <DiffieHellman> x86 is no more really, it's all AMD64 and x86 is just a (in hardware) compatibility mode now.
[15:45:19] <epony> Intel makes RISC CPUs too and the internals of the CPUs include RISC cores in various units and management logic
[15:45:47] <epony> but the entire CPU is a CISC processor and is very powerful general purpose centrol processor
[15:45:55] <epony> only AMD can compete with Intel at the moment
[15:45:59] <DiffieHellman> Intel only makes RISC CPU's now - for AMD64 the microcode turns the CISC instructions into RISC micro-ops.
[15:46:26] <epony> even Sparc64 chips are less efficient and powerful for the same energy and process
[15:46:37] <DiffieHellman> The arch is CISC, but implementing CISC is hardware is too slow.
[15:46:40] <epony> you do not know that ;-)
[15:46:41] <DiffieHellman> *in
[15:46:49] <epony> you read that on various speculative sites
[15:47:05] <epony> it is neither
[15:47:33] <epony> it's specialised logical blocks designed by middle east companies in the centre of the military operations
[15:48:27] <DiffieHellman> CISC is not inheritely slow by itself, but the AMD64 arch is currently fastest when implemented on top of RISC hardware.
[15:48:34] <epony> so Intel is buying chip designs and orders them abroad exactly as other companies in the above list do

[15:48:47] <epony> however Intel owns the factories that produce them
[15:48:55] <DiffieHellman> CISC and RISC kind of have less meaning now, as most RISC arch's have more instructions than CISC ones. 
[15:49:14] <epony> while the other vendors own 'reserved capacity' to run their batches in a competing Arab and Asian conglomerates
[15:49:17] <DiffieHellman> RISC just means "do instructions in as little clock cycles as possible"
[15:49:27] <epony> no

[16:22:32] <epony> that is why the "you're being surveyed and under surveillance" does not work as reminders, that is not actionable
[16:23:20] <epony> what the person can do is get worried a bit, try to push some buttons revealing their weak signal and obviating themselves and then continue as usual under same remote monitoring and tracking
[16:24:21] <epony> thus over time people learn to ignore those reminders and attention calls and refuse to interact with their systems and change the discussion topic or your company with someone else
[16:24:57] <epony> what you really can do is, demonstrate "what happened when this was taken a step further to someone like them" and "how it ruined them"
