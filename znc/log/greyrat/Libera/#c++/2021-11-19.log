[01:46:02] <Alipha> pinchartl: a template parameter `T` is never deduced to be a reference type. likewise, `auto` (as in, `auto x = f();`) is also never a reference type. if you want a reference type, you have to use `T&` (or `const T&` or `T&&` or such)
[01:46:57] <Alipha> pinchartl: from that article "3) If P is a reference type, the type referred to by P is used for deduction"
[01:48:06] <pinchartl> Alipha: ah, I was missing the 'T is never deduced to a reference type' part
[01:48:19] <pinchartl> would you happen to know where that's specified ?

[02:39:17] <anyone> you're also stuck in a channel that covers the C++ standard (as in: the specification), and much less so Qt as a concrete program.

[02:40:22] <kaichiuchu> heh
[02:41:01] <anyone> well, if memory use piles up measurably and observably, then it should be really easy to "short-circuit-terminate" the program at a point of sufficient memory use with exit(0) and

[08:36:32] <vancz> this forward declaration stuff is a damn pain
[08:37:12] <vancz> part of it is that i dont understand how im supposed to do somethings when you have mutual references between classes, part of it is just seemingly not being able to do things in a way that i like
[08:37:13] <vancz> ugh
[08:37:16] <vancz> </rant>
[08:37:53] <vancz> apparently i cant forward declare class member variables?
[08:38:14] <vancz> because apparently thats a definition?
[08:38:53] <RandomReader> correct

[08:39:30] <RandomReader> and in general, forward declarations should be rare, in part because it's not considered good design to have circular references or dependencies
[08:40:02] <RandomReader> there are obviously situations where it's necessary, use cases vary, but it should be out of the ordinary, not something you're regularly running into
[08:41:28] <vancz> currently im playing with writing classes for rules in a recursive grammar

[08:44:19] <vancz> Node { std::string type; };  Expression : Node { type = "expression"; };
[08:46:02] <RandomReader> types are responsible for their own members, so that would be expressed by giving Node a constructor to set the type during creation, and having a Expression constructor use it
[08:47:04] <RandomReader> Node { const std::string type; Node(std::string t) : type(std::move(t)) { } };   Expression : Node { Expression() : Node("expression") { } };

[08:52:24] <RandomReader> note this design is a bit "odd" though .. typically anything using Node would be doing it polymorphically, so wouldn't need to care that it's an Expression .. and the Expression type is known so a Node could be queried for it if necessary, e.g. during debugging
[08:53:33] <RandomReader> you may have other needs, printing or something, just don't fall into the trap of using classes only for organization
[08:54:55] <RandomReader> if you actually need discrete logic everywhere (as in something outside needs to care that it's an Expression), then having a polymorphic hierarchy probably isn't all that useful

[08:56:08] <RandomReader> so e.g. std::variant<Expression, Statement, ...>   might be another way of arranging the data, if that better fits the logic flow
[08:56:54] <RandomReader> although recursing variants is another kind of pain, so maybe that's not such a help
[08:57:14] <RandomReader> but that could be inside a Node and you use the Node for the graph, or whatever

[09:11:34] <RandomReader> ok cool .. and yeah, it's all just thoughts, often end up evolving the design once you get partway through trying it anyway

[14:40:02] <vancz> the thing that looks closest to saying no is "traits_type 	Traits; the program is ill-formed if Traits::char_type is not CharT. "
[14:40:55] <vancz> also that https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_streambuf/snextc wants to return an int_type say, though arguably i could make that work if the buffer had poitners in it?ű

[15:08:17] <vancz> ohhhh i see
[15:08:28] <vancz> i thought the "defined in header" applied to the line baove

[15:08:39] <vancz> since it was indented
[15:08:44] <vancz> and smaller
[15:09:02] <vancz> and there is a line separating every entry
[15:09:24] <vancz> so i thought it still belonged to the same entry because there is not a line separating it from the entry showing that its supposed to be a header

[22:28:11] <Alipha> pycurious: and out of curiosity, why aren't you using threads?
[22:30:15] <pycurious> Alipha: My current problem is this: I get a sequence of doubles - TB size. I need to run a function that drops most of these numbers using logic, and retains only 1/1000th of that data. Currently that function is CPU bound. I'm trying to parallelize this computation.
[22:30:40] <pycurious> Alipha: do C++ threads run on multiple cores?
[22:30:49] <Alipha> pycurious: they do
[22:31:08] <Alipha> pycurious: so use std::thread :-)
[22:31:18] <pycurious> I was thinking since the data arrives one double at a time, it was more like a pipe/streaming problem.
[22:31:21] <Raziel> pycurious, if you're looking for polite threading abstractions, https://github.com/taskflow/taskflow

[22:35:25] <pycurious> Raziel: In my case, I've a loop - that goes through doubles that its generating -> That has to be shipped to Task X, X, X…#num_cores, and then those output things into a vector that is then processed by task Y
[22:35:26] <Alipha> pycurious: what's the work exactly that you're trying to split up? because from that description, it sounds like you're just having all the threads process the same data, heh
[22:36:30] <pycurious> Alipha: I'd split the input to multiple cores -> Then each core does the same computation (Task X) on that data, reduces the size of the data, and passes it on to Task Y
[22:37:17] <kalven> how are the doubles generated?
[22:40:52] <Alipha> so sounds like you have a single producer and multiple consumers and each consumer would have its own thread-safe queue that the main thread would round-robin add doubles to each queue. or, possibly add chunks (std::vectors) of doubles at a time to a queue, depending upon how quickly the doubles are received and/or processed
[22:41:07] <Raziel> it may be worth dedicated all of your computation resources to first generating the doubles, storing all of them, and then after they're all generated doing your logic/reduction pass
[22:41:19] <Raziel> assuming that the generation of the doubles can be accelerated by dedicating more resources to it
[22:41:27] <Alipha> and then each of those Task X consumers would add their results to a Task Y thread-safe queue

[22:42:41] <pycurious> My input is coming from a process that is reading a file of doubles from a SSD RAID - so 10GB/sec. My current processing speed on a single core is 30MB/second. I'm hoping on a 100 core machine, I can get to 3GB/second.

[22:43:26] <pycurious> Alipha: precisely. I just need a thread-safe Q construct + Taskflow perhaps?
[22:43:56] *** Joins: cm007magnum (~Rheanna@61.171.21.169)
[22:44:07] <Raziel> so does your logic pass work on one double at a time, or does it need a certain number of them to do its thing?
[22:44:11] <Raziel> aka what's your actual batch size, if any
[22:45:06] <pycurious> Raziel: The actual logic currently works on 100 doubles at a time. So the main process would add 100 doubles to Qs one by one in round-robin.
[22:45:38] <pycurious> In Taskflow, how do i make my main process add elements to a thread-safe Q, and dequeue the elements in the tasks itself?

[22:48:03] <pycurious> Raziel: Trying to wrap my head around that example - thanks for the pointer
[22:48:07] <Raziel> not entirely sure how you'd use it with taskflow tasks exactly though
[22:48:20] <Raziel> that example doesn't really use taskflow, just std::threads
[22:49:50] <Alipha> or just not use taskflow tasks?
[22:50:03] <Raziel> yeah, doesn't really seem necessary here
[22:50:19] <Raziel> the whole process is simple and straightforward enough
[22:53:33] <pycurious> Raziel: I just need the example you pasted. I would use WorkStealingQueue. The owner would push the data in. The theives need to pull that data out (100 at a time), reduce the data, and push it out into another queue called O. O will then be sequentially be fed to function Y.
[22:53:56] <pycurious> I'm not sure how to do that yet, in that example code though
[22:54:39] <pycurious> Raziel: I thnk -> In my case, I dont need the owner thread, since my main process is just generating that data.
[22:54:43] <kalven> better start hacking then
[22:54:45] <Raziel> maybe your queue should be a queue of 100-element arrays, rather than a queue of straight up doubles

[22:55:45] <pycurious> Raziel: so make a q of 100 elements, then ship it to a theif?
[22:56:49] <pycurious> Or I could just make 100 element Qs and then ship them in function X - but now call that function in a thread.
[22:56:55] <Raziel> your "main thread" in this situation is the one the disk i/o one that gets those doubles from your file and into memory. and since you wanna work on 100 at a time, it makes sense for you to have 100-element arrays.
[22:57:41] <Raziel> you only need *one* queue, ever, for this. and that queue can then receive your 100-element batches, and the worker threads can steal 100-element batches from the queue as soon as they're available
[23:01:10] <Raziel> alternatively, the workers could create their own batches, stealing doubles one at a time, but ehhh
