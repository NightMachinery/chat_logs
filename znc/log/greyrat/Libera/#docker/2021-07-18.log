[00:34:55] <hrtk> Hello, I want to share data among my docker-compose services. I found that I can do it using volumes but volumes persist their data even after `docker-compose down`. Is there a way to just share data and not let it persist ?

[00:45:30] <labella> what do you think about docker-osx repository
[00:46:29] <akik> labella: i think it's weird that an ex-ubuntu employee created sosumi (maybe related to docker-osx)
[00:47:48] <labella> maybe :)
[00:48:02] <akik> labella: does docker-osx use qemu to start the vm?
[00:48:34] <labella> yep as I know
[00:50:01] <BtbN> It's an OSX VM in a docker container.
[00:50:05] <BtbN> Not all that great really
[00:51:50] <artok> that was really bad
[00:53:10] <akik> i've read that it's working fine as a macos in a vm
[00:53:18] <labella> It said that good for bulding CI CD pipeline
[00:53:31] <artok> hrtk: persistent data is just about that, data persistency... if you want to delete volumes, delete them
[00:53:49] <akik> what would you expect of a graphics intensive gui in a vm?
[00:53:52] <artok> no it's not, extra layer, qemu isn't good running macOS
[00:55:38] <labella> i think it is usefull and cost efective for pipelines
[00:55:46] <artok> you'll get more usable CI buying macOS pipelines from Azure, AWS or
[00:55:53] <artok> ..whatever
[00:56:31] <labella> more usable but more cost right?
[00:56:39] <artok> for cost effectiness I'd say no... 
[00:56:50] <artok> time is money
[00:57:26] <artok> sure if you want to spend days on your compile time, go ahead and have few layers slowing down your compile process
[00:57:26] <akik> maybe you can close the macos gui ?
[00:57:58] <labella> sure you are right but it is not valid for everyone
[00:58:16] <artok> it is
[00:59:58] <artok> the one that spins up qemu under docker to get mac builds should go and buy mac mini to do the work
[01:00:15] <artok> or rent vm from those cloud providers
[01:00:23] <artok> that is money saving tip

[01:09:52] <artok> sometimes people forget use case... sure, you can have fun and learn about qemu and stuff... but mostly this reminds me about south park episode where mr garrison invents the "IT" vehicle
[01:12:20] <hrtk> artok: No no. I DON'T want persistent data
[01:12:35] <hrtk> I just want to share some data across containers (services in docker-compose)
[01:14:00] <labella74> you are right guys
[01:16:34] <artok> hrtk: yeah, have those volumes to share the data but delete them afterwards
[01:17:46] <artok> or then have some mqtt to share the data
[01:18:00] <artok> depends so much application and so on
[01:18:17] <hrtk> artok: mutt will be too much. I have django running on one side hosting static files and nginx running on other container
[01:18:24] <hrtk> nginx needs to access statics files generated by django
[01:18:49] <artok> that would indeed be persistent data use case there
[01:19:11] <akik> IT should be fun, learning about what technologies can help you to do. you learn best by breaking stuff
[01:19:26] <hrtk> but when there are changes in the static files (say, the upstream changed the structure etc) then those changes are not reflected in the volume
[01:19:48] <artok> that is basic django migrating for what I last time checked 
[01:19:57] <hrtk> I scratched my head a lot then found out that new volumes were not being created, that's why
[01:20:10] *** Joins: mattchis (~mattchis@c-73-243-45-46.hsd1.co.comcast.net)
[01:20:53] <artok> you can delete them 
[01:20:56] <hrtk> artok: migrating is for database. Let's just say that many static files changed because of some reason (it does happen here) then they don't get updated if there exists a volume
[01:21:00] <artok> if you really want to ditch
[01:21:14] <hrtk> artok: Yeah, I guess that's my only option.
