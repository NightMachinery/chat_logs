[14:18:47] <thdot[m]> Hi. One of our students probably bricked our B210. I don't know exactly what he did, but the device is not visible via lsusb anymore (blue power led is on though). Does anyone have a tip on how I can bring the device back to life? 
[14:19:34] *** Joins: yesno (~yesno@109.98.151.179)
[14:19:53] <drmpeg> Usually unplugging and plugging back in does the trick.
[14:21:04] <tnt> there is no flashable / permanent storage on the b210. If it doesn't show up, something is _physically_ wrong with it. Either broken connector, track or fried component.

[14:33:56] <drmpeg> Like tnt said, there's nothing to rescue. When you plug in a board that's been powered down, it just comes up in USB 2.0 mode with the built-in Cypress USB config.
[14:35:16] <drmpeg> In dmesg, it says "Westbridge" for the USB ID.
[14:36:48] <drmpeg> Then when you fire up UHD, it downloads the USB firmware and the port restarts in USB 3.0 mode.

[18:15:36] <DerekKozel[m]> Many of the SDRs shown at GRCon have 1PPS sync, byt the price tags start at the high end of USRPs

[21:07:21] <funkylab[m]> <jholtom> "Mixers are cheap!" <- for 20 GHz, mixers are *affordable*, but cables of any significant length start to hurt. Antennas on the other hand come for free with every element of your RF chain

[22:04:06] <noc0lour_> <jholtom> "Mixers are cheap!" <- Every nonlinear element is a mixer and everything is a nonlinear element, even a cheese sandwich :)
[22:04:33] <jholtom> noc0lour_: now I want to try that....
[22:10:44] <noc0lour_> Just a matter of overcoming loss... Everything is possible if you own a gyrotron
[22:11:08] <river> hey
[22:12:17] <river> https://www.amazon.co.uk/ask/questions/Tx2T7VADZEUL4NL what you thnk of this?
[22:16:03] <noc0lour_> that's possibly the cheapest way of getting any SDR receiver, I think that was the original question
[22:17:56] <river> damn
[22:18:06] <river> the dongle itself is 35 USD, 37 GBP
[22:20:01] <noc0lour_> I have no overview if you would get the other things for less than the kit price, possibly 
[22:20:38] <muaddib[m]> <DerekKozel[m]> "Per Vices has one to 18 GHz..." <- Thanks derek!
[22:20:38] <muaddib[m]> I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m cool enough to own a â€˜cyber radioâ€™. ! I think I need a bunch of stickers on my laptop and a hoodieâ€¦oh waitâ€¦
[22:21:10] <noc0lour_> in my experience your mileage varies a lot of on this type of antenna, so getting a seperate "proper" antenna for an interesting frequency band might be worth a shot 
[22:21:28] <patchvonbraun[m]> I once made a 20ghz signal source using a cheap X-band mixer diode situated at the bottom of a piece of 12mm copper tube. Pumped with a B210 at a suitable fraction of the desired frequency.  Worked FAR better than I expected.

[22:25:00] <river> it's difficult to decide if i should order from US or UK
[22:26:39] <DerekKozel[m]> Where to? 
[22:27:26] <river> uk
[22:27:39] <river> the thing seems to cost a lot more here for some reason
[22:27:44] <noc0lour_> why would you order from the US? 
[22:27:55] <river> it comes out very slightly cheaper when you add postage
[22:28:03] <noc0lour_> because it probably has customs already included? don't you have to pay extra custom? 
[22:30:06] <muaddib[m]> <noc0lour_> "> <@muaddib:gnuradio.org> Thanks..." <- Oh man! Iâ€™ve wanted one of those for a while.

[22:44:17] <DerekKozel[m]> Lots of fun SDR happenings in the Edinburgh hackspace, at least a few years ago. There's some other folks from the area in the channel.

[23:12:27] <AdaBull[m]> Hey guys, short fundamental question. Why does an SDR in loopback mode have a slightly rotated constellation if it uses direct sampling ? Thanks for any reply
[23:12:56] <funkylab[m]> AdaBull: counterquestion: why shouldn't it?
[23:15:19] <funkylab[m]> you'd have to adjust the DAC-to-ADC sampling delay exactly such that it is the same as the group delay of the full chain between the output of the DAC and the input of the ADC

[23:26:43] *** Joins: bt0_ (~bt0@co2-84-90-226-37.netvisao.pt)
[23:27:16] <funkylab[m]> to be fair, "direct sampling" might imply an SDR that has a maximum frequency up to 40 MHz or something, and you can't bridge a lot of distance in 25ns at 2/3Â·c â€¦

[23:35:33] <AdaBull[m]> No i understand the delay, i tought it was something else. My problem was that i didn't have the shift using QPSK but had it with Qam. Now the qpsk uses costas which knows the constellation. And here comes my misinterpretation (i guess) that i thought that the polyphase filters etc know the constellation (which is wrong) -> so what you say makes complete sense
