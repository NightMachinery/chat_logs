[00:25:51] <JohnDoe2> re101-adelie-61 cool what are we doing here
[00:26:46] <re101-adelie-61> i want the regex only to find namespace mybacked, because it includes a class
[00:27:09] <JohnDoe2> find = match the whole thing?

[00:27:53] <re101-adelie-61> the result shall be myBackend

[00:29:30] <re101-adelie-61> "includes a class" = includes string "class "between the curly brackets
[00:29:50] <re101-adelie-61> its cpp code

[10:28:31] <digitok> also, that paste site sucks. i just deleted your paste lol
[10:28:58] <digitok> i mean the site itself is good, but they should fix that
[10:30:12] <fdan> digitok that works, but i feel complicated
[10:30:31] <digitok> we're all complicated
[10:31:29] <fdan> in this expression \d{2}[.]\d{2}[.]\d{2}[.]\d{2}
[10:31:39] <digitok> you can do https://regex101.com/r/W7UlTs/3 if you prefer
[10:31:42] <fdan> i know this always looks for all the octets which has size of 2 or 3
[10:31:51] <fdan> sorry i take that back ^
[10:32:04] <fdan> i know this always looks for all the octets which has size of 2
[10:32:24] <fdan> but i want to modify in such a way so that each octet can be 2 or 3 digits in length
[10:32:53] <digitok> you can use the link i posted and change 1,3 to 2,3
[10:33:22] <fdan> digitok what if the size of any octet is just 1 digit in length
[10:33:29] <fdan> in that case 1 to 3 will work?
[10:33:33] <fdan> also what is \b?
[10:33:33] <digitok> yes
[10:34:01] <digitok> \b is a word boundary, it will prevent matching if the char next to it is a letter or digit (or _)

[10:35:18] <fdan> how to ignore this
[10:35:55] <digitok> are you sure you don't just want the first word on each line?
[10:36:01] <digitok> word being the ip
[10:36:56] <fdan> i will want the ips
[10:37:10] <fdan> but i dont want to have 0.9.7.9 or 0.8.10.3
[10:37:24] <digitok> and is the ip always at the start of the line?
[10:37:46] <fdan> \b\d{1,3}[.]\d{1,3}[.]\d{1,3}[.]\d{1,3} would be great if you could tweak this a little as its more understandable
[10:37:51] <fdan> yes its always at the first of the line
[10:38:03] <digitok> and are there lines that don't start with an ip?
[10:38:19] <fdan> no there are not
[10:38:51] <digitok> then you can just use yourstring.split(" ")[0]
[10:39:01] <digitok> no need for regex
[10:39:15] <fdan> yes :)  i am aware of that
[10:39:28] <digitok> is this for an assignment?

[10:39:57] <fdan> yes thats right, you gave some soluntion that involved re.multiline
[10:40:07] <digitok> ok so it was you
[10:40:22] <fdan> that again looks tough for me to think over
[10:40:37] <fdan> yes thats right. it was me
[10:40:39] <digitok> wasn't it just ^\S+ ?
[10:41:09] <fdan> r'(?m)^\S+'
[10:41:13] <fdan> you gave me this 
[10:41:20] <digitok> yes, that's the simplest solution
[10:41:44] <fdan> \b\d{1,3}[.]\d{1,3}[.]\d{1,3}[.]\d{1,3}')
[10:41:58] <digitok> that is simpler to you? lol
[10:42:10] <fdan> can you tell me how to avoid 0.9.7.9 by using this expression \b\d{1,3}[.]\d{1,3}[.]\d{1,3}[.]\d{1,3}')
[10:42:23] <digitok> you can change \b to ^

[11:24:44] <digitok> yes it matches any number between 1-3 digits in length
[11:25:42] <fdan> what would be the fix
[11:26:19] <digitok> you could use r'HTTP/1\.1" \d+ (\d+)'
[11:27:50] <fdan> what is the meaning if you include ()
[11:28:12] <digitok> it creates a capture group and stores the text in it
[11:28:27] <digitok> that's why you use .group(1) as it's the first group

[17:21:05] <digitok> don't make me slap you
[17:21:27] <purplex> but be gentle
[17:21:50] <digitok> it's logically equivalent, not literally or practically
[17:21:57] <digitok> in regex, it's not equivalent
[17:22:08] <digitok> for what he intended it to do, it's equivalent
[17:22:09] <purplex> ah ok, so no use
[17:22:13] <digitok> lol
[17:22:56] <digitok> like [^\w]+ is both logically and literally equivalent to \W+
[17:23:02] <digitok> but this is only logically :p
[17:23:19] <NiLon> *sniff*
[17:23:27] <digitok> quiet you
[17:36:02] <purplex> yep logic which doesn't work purple x'ed me lol
