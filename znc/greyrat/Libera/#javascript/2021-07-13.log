[00:06:48] <austincheney> any idea on anything you can do in JavaScript embedded in a page that would be reported by chrome developer protocol?  I am trying to figure out how to message to the terminal from within the page (no matter how indirect) to CDP
[00:15:48] <wroathe> austincheney: Did you see that example I sent you?
[00:15:54] <wroathe> austincheney: Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the question

[00:16:49] <austincheney> wroathe, I did and it was very helpful.
[00:17:06] <wroathe> austincheney: Ah. Did it not work though? Or are you asking about something else?
[00:17:30] <austincheney> wroathe, now I want to be able to do something in the page and inform the terminal such a thing is done without having to poll the page from the terminal seeking update

[00:19:18] <wroathe> austincheney: So you're looking for like a programmatic eventing mechanism
[00:19:21] <austincheney> wroathe, the Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument is incredibly helpful as when a new page loads (or refreshes) the injected script is just there which will allow me to bypass the DOM api of CDP
[00:19:29] <wroathe> austincheney: So your JS script can fire an event that your CDP program is listening for
[00:19:30] <austincheney> wroathe, yes
[00:20:22] <wroathe> Hrm. Well, I was able to find the solution to your first problem by digging in the source for Playwright
[00:20:26] <austincheney> wroathe, I am performing test evaluation in the actual page and not on the terminal, but I need to report that evaluation back to the terminal so that it can send the next test item or halt with a report
[00:20:30] <wroathe> I'd probably start there again
[00:20:42] <austincheney> that is a good idea.  i can do that

[00:38:06] <austincheney> wroathe, I still need to test this but I think the answer is something like Runtime.evaluate({expression:"window.drialRemote.parse('test JSON instance')",silent:false}) where window.drialRemote is a library I am inserting into the target before the next page is loaded
[00:38:44] <wroathe> austincheney: Yeah, the playwright API uses the term "evaluate" too, so I assume you're right on the money.
[00:39:06] *** Joins: sickdyd (~sickd@120.51.82.69.ap.gmobb-fix.jp)
[00:39:48] <austincheney> that custom library allows me to use regular standard DOM methods chained together (or properites of the window object) to get to anything in the page and then assert it right there in the page
[00:41:15] <wroathe> Yeah, that's how playwright's evaluate works too
[00:41:18] <austincheney> wroathe, for examples see the second code sample here: https://github.com/prettydiff/share-file-systems/blob/master/documentation/test_browser.md#data-structure
[00:42:46] <wroathe> austincheney: Neat
[00:43:04] <austincheney> so thats cool, because you can extend the DOM to do things that aren't in the standard.  The code sample features a method getModalsByModalType which is only valid to that application
[00:43:35] <austincheney> but you can also do other things too like getElementsByAttribute, getElementsByText, getNodesByType, and so forth

[06:40:14] <wroathe> Croves: Because fetchConnections is a property of methods, which is a property of `this`
[06:40:46] <Croves> wroathe So should I call it by using this.methods.fetchConnections?

[07:16:08] <Rockwood> anyway my mistake i am totally responsible for it

[07:20:24] <jacekowski> nope, it all decodes to string
[07:20:48] <jacekowski> in any other language that i'm actually familiar with i would just cast it
[07:20:57] <jacekowski> but that doesn't work in js
[07:21:26] <jacekowski> i could solve it with my own base64 decoder but i don't really want to as i feel there should be a builtin way of doing it
[07:22:36] <sillyslux> js doesn't even have a builtin base64 decoder
[07:23:16] <jacekowski> well, what atob() does then?
[07:23:17] <sillyslux> atob/btoa are available only in browsers

[07:25:05] <sillyslux> for node.js you definitely have to take something from npm or write your own

[07:25:44] <theskillwithin> https://www.base64decoder.io/node-js/
[07:26:00] <theskillwithin> btw idk, i just googled it
[07:26:19] <jacekowski> hmmmm i just realised something
[07:26:20] <sillyslux> oh...
[07:26:26] <jacekowski> javascript has no int64 support
[07:26:39] <theskillwithin> jacekowski i think CKobAAAAAAA= isn't valid
[07:26:53] <theskillwithin> oh interesting
[07:27:22] <jacekowski> theskillwithin: it is valid 64 bit integer

[15:37:13] <paule32> how can i load, and update the divs, that are loaded per ajax
[15:37:42] <paule32> so, the window divs can have differences between the others
[15:39:19] <paule32> so "window" is the super class, as template, and the fine tuning can be made by functions that emit the corresponding javascript code (injected)

[16:00:58] <entuland> what's your end goal, beeza? I see nothing good coming out from that question
[16:01:42] <Cork> trying to start a flamewar i suspect
[16:01:51] <beeza> Cork: because typescript adds static typing, which, if you were not aware, is not intended to be dynamic typing, which javascript has.
[16:02:02] <beeza> Cork: static typing is static, not dynamic, by definition
[16:02:15] <beeza> Cork: so I can, without dynamic validation, rule out most classes of errors
[16:02:33] <Cork> beeza: if it wasn't obvous the question was retorical
[16:02:39] <beeza> Cork: no it was not
[16:02:54] <beeza> Cork: it is indicative of not understanding that static typing is not dynamic typing
[16:03:03] <entuland> yeah, flamewar

[16:03:08] <beeza> it's like saying why use types in C if the compiler is not running when my code is running

[16:03:57] <beeza> If the actual reason is that people don't understand that static typing is dynamic typing, okay, fair enough

[16:06:20] <entuland> some people simply don't need those added bumpers and belts and airbags, even though they may be fully aware of the differences and added "safety"
[16:07:25] <entuland> but trying to extrapolate their _understanding_ from their choices and preferences, is kinda flamey
[16:08:02] <nedbat> beeza: some of the reason might be inertia. some might be that static typing can be stricter than people need.
[16:08:48] <nedbat> beeza: i doubt anyone thinks that static typing and dynamic typing are the same thing. I must have misunderstood what you meant by that.
[16:09:32] <beeza> nedbat: if your objection is that the static typing of typescript has no impact during runtime, then I don't see what else that could mean than somehow confusing static and dynamic typing
[16:09:59] <beeza> s/your objection/someone's objection/g
[16:10:16] <Harlin> it's all flamey if you ask me. Though no one did. hmm.
[16:10:23] <nedbat> beeza: i guess some people might misunderstand the benefits in that way.
[16:10:33] <beeza> static typing of C++, java, kotlin, rust, golang, etc also has no impact at runtime
[16:10:40] <nedbat> beeza: but agree with others here that your tone seems confrontational
[16:11:01] <beeza> fair enough
[16:11:28] <beeza> Cork: apologies, could have responded better
[16:11:35] <Harlin> i know man. sometimes i just wanna have an argument. usually no one joins and ill just argue with myself for a bit.
[16:11:35] <nedbat> beeza: in my experience, it's not true that "most classes of errors" are passing the wrong types around.
[16:11:54] <entuland> eheheh, nice, Harlin :P
[16:12:09] <beeza> nedbat: maybe not in practice, but I think the statement is valid for potential errors
[16:12:19] <entuland> I do that in real life yelling at myself sometimes :P
[16:12:42] <Harlin> i love how people can get worked up over programming languages. :-)
[16:13:19] <Harlin> entuland, my son used to do that when he was like 3 years old. start getting into it with himself. it was funny.
[16:13:27] <entuland> :)
[16:13:48] <nedbat> beeza: it seems like you agree that in practice, static typing isn't catching the bulk of errors.  So testing is the tool to do that, and it finds many of the same errors as static typing.
[16:14:10] <beeza> nedbat: like if all I know is that a file is valid typescript (for strict validation), vs valid javascript, then that rules out most potential errors IMO. At least it rules out so many that I don't care to review someone's javascript because I don't know if they are maybe making some of the errors that woudl be ruled out by typescript and I would rather they consult tsc for that validation than me
[16:14:37] <nedbat> beeza: you will skip a code review just because the static type checker passes the file?
[16:14:52] <beeza> nedbat: I would block a review because it is .js and not .ts
[16:15:06] <beeza> I am not going to waste my time reviewing something which I have to do the job of a static type checker
[16:15:09] <beeza> I value my time
[16:15:15] <Harlin> Hmm I wonder if there is a #typescript
[16:15:17] <nedbat> beeza: i see
[16:15:40] <Harlin> There is. 19 peeps.
[16:15:41] <Cork> Harlin: there is

[16:16:29] <Harlin> Get a typescript mug.
[16:16:47] <nedbat> beeza: the tech field is littered with technologies that are *obviously* better to their advocates, and which don't get widely adopted. It's a source of frustration to many.
[16:16:57] <Alexendoo> Harlin: there is one

[16:17:13] <Alexendoo> Or was, before
[16:17:20] <beeza> even if you don't use typescript, I still want to know the same things type annotatons would tell me from javascript
[16:17:35] <entuland> no, that would defeat the purpose, a mug is a dynamic container that can have anything in it - they'll come up with a container that only accepts water, another that only accepts coffee and so forth
[16:17:48] <Harlin> Alexendoo, that's awesome.
[16:17:59] <Harlin> entuland, oh you're right. not so awesome :(
[16:18:06] <beeza> Again, I value my time enough to not want to go and guess what the heck the author was thinking when they wrote it, so either type annotations go in as typescript, or as probably wrong jsdoc comments

[17:55:15] <entuland> still not enough details - as a wild guess, you may be better creating the payload anew instead of mangling any existing data structure and "clean it up" from the stuff you don't need
[17:55:39] <banana_> so use a different function basically
[17:55:54] <entuland> hard to say from the data you shared so far about your specific case
[17:57:00] <entuland> what you have and what you want are still not clear, and those should be the first thing to be pointed out, before any "hows"
[17:57:29] <nedbat> banana_: the best part of functional programming is the idea of immutable data.  Although you *can* mutate objects in JS, it's better if you don't.  Make a new object.

[17:58:32] <entuland> if you have an object with 10 elements that have to stay and only one property has to be removed, you could be fine just overwriting / nulling it
[17:58:43] <entuland> if you have 1 that stays and 10 that go, it's better to create a new one
[17:58:54] <entuland> context is pretty much always meaningful

[18:26:58] <banana_> I like the idea of setting up some pattern that if they dont obey the api then either they have to rewrite a whole bunch or just obey it forcing their bad habits in a smaller scope
[18:27:09] <banana_> unless that's a pipe dream. I think it's possible
[18:28:04] <banana_> the idea is forcing people to code a certain way. in a passive agressive way.
[18:28:26] <entuland> don't think passive aggressive comes in useful anywhere
[18:28:52] <banana_> I think it does. firing people has a huge dependency on power.

[18:30:04] <paule32> hello

[19:11:14] <entuland> well, technically you don't need jquery and handling requests "the old way" - you could use vanilla JS and the fetch api
[19:11:23] <paule32> but easyui is optimized for static content
[19:11:35] <entuland> it really depends on how much of such libraries you need

[23:14:04] <MaxFury> hi
[23:14:21] <MaxFury> i would like the dropdown to stay when the datepicker appears

[23:14:52] <MaxFury> it appears now when i click on any item in the dropdown, but the dropdownn disappears
[23:14:59] <MaxFury> how can i make the dropdown stay?
[23:15:38] *** Joins: mattf (mattf@2600:3c03::f03c:92ff:fea6:56a4)
[23:16:10] <GreenJello> maybe reopen it after it closes?
[23:16:23] <GreenJello> but clicking on the date picker is probably still going to close it
[23:16:55] *** Joins: paule32_ (~paule32@user/paule32)
[23:17:18] <MaxFury> is there a way to stop it from closing?
[23:17:41] <GreenJello> you would probably have the read the dropdown code to figure that out
[23:17:50] <MaxFury> i can wrap the datepicker inside some container
[23:17:56] *** Joins: paule32__ (~paule32@user/paule32)
[23:18:16] <MaxFury> there is a command parentEl which makes the code for datepicker inside some parent element
[23:18:21] <MaxFury> by default it's in body
[23:19:11] <GreenJello> it's still probably going to close when you click it

[23:26:07] <samsch> That'd normally pretty much go against the functionality of a dropdown, unless the datepicker was inside the dropdown element.

[23:27:15] *** Quits: l__q (~modinfo@user/modinfo) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[23:27:43] <samsch> Also, you shouldn't use anchor tags for buttons. `href="#"` and similar functionality should pretty much always be considered wrong.
[23:28:51] <earendel> samsch: what would you use for navigating on same page?
[23:29:00] *** Quits: metadaemon (~metadaemo@user/metadaemon) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:29:19] <samsch> `href="#some-id"`
[23:29:56] <samsch> `href="#"` is intended to not do anything, which is incorrect semantics for a non-inactive link.
[23:32:54] <samsch> Presumably, if the default behavior (and *only* the default behavior) of a link with `href="#"` was what you wanted, that'd be fine then. I'm not sure there's a use-case for it though.
[23:33:15] <MaxFury> samsch, so if the parent element of the date picker is the dropdown menu's container, it should stay?
[23:34:04] <samsch> MaxFury, Depends on how it's coded, but it probably should, since you wouldn't be taking focus outside the dropdown.
[23:34:37] <samsch> Dropdowns are generally just iffy and nasty things to work with. Usually bad for UX, most of the time bad for a11y.

[23:37:23] <onosendi> Is this the most efficient way to change a property of an object in an array? https://dpaste.org/s48B
[23:38:05] <sheetjs> onosendi: that creates a new object
[23:38:29] <systemfault> onosendi: It's the most efficient unless you simply mutates the object.
[23:38:38] <sheetjs> its incorrect
[23:38:47] *** Joins: jess (~jess@libera/staff/jess)
[23:38:57] <systemfault> It's correct to me.
[23:38:57] <sheetjs> "change a property of an object in an array" is almost certainly a request for mutation
[23:39:03] <samsch> onosendi, You're mutating the original array, but creating a new object. Is that intentional, or are you trying to be completely "pure" or just mutate?
[23:40:52] *** Joins: summersault (~summersau@179.221.251.16)
[23:41:04] <systemfault> ^
[23:41:06] <onosendi> samsch: I guess in this case mutation is ok.
[23:42:22] <samsch> What you're doing is pretty reasonable for that exact purpose, but if you want to mutate all the way, then `arr.find((i) => i.id === 1).name = 'baz';` and if you want an immutable update: `const new Arr = arr.map(i => i.id === 1 ? { ...i, name: 'baz' } : i)`

[23:43:57] <onosendi> ljharb: Is it safe to say I always want immutable update?
[23:44:07] <ljharb> imo yes.
[23:45:56] <systemfault> *Yes, unless you have performance issues and it's not "just a guess", you used a profiler and found out that a particular part makes your application unusably slow.
[23:46:31] <ljharb> right. and you should only really be using a profiler in the first place when your application is already unusably slow

[23:49:13] <ashnur> is here someone with a neovim setup who uses treesitter and lsp and writes libraries, frontend/node.js code and modules as well? hopefully i am not asking much :D
[23:49:15] <onosendi> samsch: ah, interesting. I had no idea this would update `t`. https://dpaste.org/Hgv5

[23:50:58] <ashnur> i want specifically someone js user onosendi, if i had a specific neovim issue, i would go there
[23:51:22] <entuland> if there are going to be many lookups of that kind, I would probably use the ID as index
[23:51:29] <onosendi> ashnur: you prefer lsp over CoC?
