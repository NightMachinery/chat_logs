[00:47:54] <derpadmin> did you ever hit a motivation wall where you feel devops is over complicated and inentersting and you would rather go and code a re-invent the wheel small thing?
[00:48:16] <kwilczynski> Yes. Yes.
[00:48:19] <kwilczynski> Rewrite in Rust.
[00:48:19] <derpadmin> *ininteresting
[00:48:44] <derpadmin> :)
[00:48:48] <kwilczynski> derpadmin: Funny you said that - look how many "devops" tooling companies there are now.
[00:48:58] <kwilczynski> Solving the same problem... problems... "better" :)
[00:49:28] <derpadmin> ok, that is reassuring
[00:49:34] <kwilczynski> Like, the sheer fact that someone build a business around running Terraform, got founding and such.
[00:49:50] <derpadmin> I have to complete my second aws certification... it bores me out of my mind
[00:49:55] <kwilczynski> Makes me think about how VCs hand money to people.
[00:50:12] <kwilczynski> derpadmin: Because it's boring :)
[00:50:25] <lantech19446> derpadmin: whatever you do don't say that in the #aws channel that's what I got kicked for
[00:50:37] <derpadmin> thank you, it does not help, but I somewhat feel better
[00:50:41] <kwilczynski> derpadmin: Every customer of mine is solving the same problems - which is probably the reason why there are so many companies building tooling for DevOps.
[00:50:47] <derpadmin> hahaha lantech19446 
[00:50:48] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: Haha.
[00:51:00] <kwilczynski> Oh nice. We aligned on number of characters :)
[00:51:26] <derpadmin> seems so
[00:51:33] <derpadmin> thanks guys
[00:51:37] <kwilczynski> derpadmin: :)
[00:51:42] <derpadmin> might be covid and my personal life too...
[00:51:49] <derpadmin> just can't motivate myself it seems
[00:52:22] <kwilczynski> derpadmin: This COVID fatigue is affecting everyone everywhere, I am noticing.
[00:52:34] <kwilczynski> derpadmin: A friend of mine is a Linux kernel developer - same story.
[00:52:35] <kwilczynski> :)
[00:53:14] <derpadmin> it would make sense...
[00:53:29] <derpadmin> made a cool personal project and got certified in 2021
[00:53:33] <kwilczynski> lantech19446 is a bookworm as of late studying various things to up his game, and I am sure he also feels a bit exhausted of past three years or so.
[00:53:36] <derpadmin> and now I just feel drain
[00:53:43] <derpadmin> like watching bad american movie drain
[00:54:04] <lantech19446> I feel exhausted from the last 30 of years of my life living with untreated bipolar
[00:54:22] <kwilczynski> derpadmin: You just need to make it a "B" movie with Bruce Willis.
[00:54:31] <kwilczynski> lantech19446: *Hugs*
[00:54:39] <lantech19446> thanks kwilczynski 
[00:54:44] * derpadmin deploy hugs
[00:54:49] <kwilczynski> derpadmin: (and there are nowadays "B" movies with him)
[00:54:53] * derpadmin monitor metrics of hugs
[00:55:44] <lantech19446> right now i'm studying for my amateur extra license, this is far more difficult and far more enjoyable than aws cloud practitioner
[00:55:50] * kwilczynski gets paged... CrashLoopBackOff
[00:55:56] <kwilczynski> derpadmin: Sorry. We tried.

[01:06:05] <gordonjcp> my forum is the top hit on Google for the phrase "range rover pub"
[01:06:08] <kwilczynski> derpadmin: I hope you are feeling better.
[01:06:12] <gordonjcp> and it's all thanks to devops
[01:06:22] <gordonjcp> do you know how many hits on that phrase in December alone?
[01:06:28] <kwilczynski> Range rover pub?
[01:06:28] <gordonjcp> someone take a guess
[01:06:31] <gordonjcp> yup
[01:06:49] <gordonjcp> the forum is called "rangerovers.pub" because a mate and I wanted to start a Range Rover forum and we were in a pub when we thought of it
[01:07:27] <gordonjcp> for that phrase, just in December it got 36 hits!  That's over one a day!

[01:08:36] <kwilczynski> gordonjcp: Needs Kubernetes, clearly.
[01:08:40] <dodo> might want to consider a domain without trademarks before scaling
[01:09:13] <gordonjcp> kwilczynski: I'd like to have a play with k8s
[01:09:27] <gordonjcp> dodo: it's not a problem
[01:09:47] <gordonjcp> dodo: it is clearly not attempting to be an official JLR site
[01:10:46] <gordonjcp> kwilczynski: it uses docker though
[01:11:17] <derpadmin> havent try the k8 from vultr... might give it a shot
[01:13:10] <gordonjcp> I feel like I'm not devops enough
[01:13:47] <gordonjcp> I just keep my docker-compose projects in git, check them out into ~/docker/ on a server, and add a docker-compose.override.yaml and maybe a .env to set site-specific stuff
[01:14:21] <gordonjcp> not only do I feel like this probably shouldn't be in my homedir, I also feel like it's overcomplicated and at the same time not complicated enough
[01:14:30] <gordonjcp> do I need to add some ansible to it, or puppet, or both
[01:18:00] <kwilczynski> :)
[01:18:57] <gordonjcp> in all seriousness, where should I put all these docker-compose projects, if not my homedir
[01:19:19] <gordonjcp> it seems like something that's going to get to be a PITA if I ever have to allow anyone else to work on them

[01:40:32] <slaughter> ...in the repo of the project?
[01:43:18] <gordonjcp> which you put where?
[01:46:27] <slaughter> Wherever my projects go. I have a couple dirs depending on whether it's work or not
[01:46:45] <gordonjcp> okay, and where do your projects go?
[01:46:54] <slaughter> I put those dirs in `~/Desktop` because I hate myself
[01:46:58] <gordonjcp> right
[01:47:12] <gordonjcp> so, not any different from me putting them in ~ 
[01:47:43] <slaughter> Nope

[01:48:15] <slaughter> Well
[01:48:18] <slaughter> Sorta different
[01:49:27] <gordonjcp> I wondered if they should go in some "system-y" directory
[01:50:00] <gordonjcp> maybe stick them into something like /srv/docker/webshite1 /srv/docker/crappyblog /srv/docker/comedyproxy type thing

[02:25:30] <Joel> The covid drain is real
[02:37:06] <slaughter> gordonjcp why would they be in a system directory though? Are you talking about on your servers?
[02:40:33] <Joel> gordonjcp they go in git, so I can put them anywhere :)
[02:43:46] <gordonjcp> Joel: right, but when you actually deploy them to a server, where would they go?
[02:43:53] <gordonjcp> slaughter: on the server, yes
[02:44:10] <slaughter> Who cares where they go on the server?
[02:44:34] <slaughter> You copy 'em and start the containers, the source files are basically irrelevant at that point
[02:46:21] <gordonjcp> right
[02:46:29] <gordonjcp> but then what if I'm not the only person that needs to access them
[02:49:25] <rawtaz> i usually mount my data storages in /data or /data1, /data2 etc and e.g. put docker services under /data/services/<foo,bar,...> but it doesnt matter at all
[02:53:23] <slaughter> Well in that case, ~ is probably a good choice, since anyone logging in to that server is going to land there and probably start looking there
[02:54:54] <rawtaz> haha i sure havent been following the discussion :)
[02:55:07] <rawtaz> i'd never put them in there when i have a separate data partition for my stuff thats not the OS
[02:56:45] <slaughter> Alternative to all of the above: don't use long-lived servers. :)
[02:57:07] <rawtaz> that works for some businesses and use cases, but not for everyone
[02:57:52] <slaughter> Oh for sure, but it would solve the problem
[02:58:20] <slaughter> Also gordonjcp I imagine you have some kind of script to copy over the files? 
[02:58:36] <slaughter> If so...there's where the files are, people. Just check the deploy config

[21:59:43] <Dus10> Hey, is anyone using an IPAM system to hand out network address spaces for Infrastructure as Code?
[22:15:58] <kwilczynski> Dus10: For on-premise or in the cloud too?
[22:16:25] <Dus10> both
[22:16:33] <kwilczynski> Some public clouds make it very very hard for you to manage addresses within a given CIDR.
[22:17:20] <Dus10> I haven't come across such issues
[22:17:32] <kwilczynski> Dus10: I used to run Infoblox and it was a pain.
[22:17:34] <Dus10> I just need to ask a database for an available address space
[22:17:47] <Dus10> Infoblox ix what I have seen the most
[22:18:08] <kwilczynski> Perhaps you need CMDB rather than IPAM?
[22:31:58] <gordonjcp> Dus10: netbox has an API
[22:49:23] <Dus10> I am not looking for a solution, in particular
[22:49:32] <Dus10> I am just seeing if this is something people have been doing
[22:49:56] <Dus10> I have a customer that I want to be able to request a landing zone
[22:50:00] <Dus10> which I have most of that worked out
[22:50:13] <Dus10> but to fully automate it, it needs an address space
