[01:49:42] <kuudes> has any country used a ceo model for its organization?
[01:50:30] <Betawolf> a ruler that can be deposed by a council of financiers?
[01:50:32] <kuudes> ie that they would somehow elect a smallish board whose trust the ceo/president should enjoy, but otherwise the ceo was quite free to implement the policy
[01:51:12] <kuudes> ie 1 person decides on policies but a majority of a multiple persons could fire them at moment's notice
[01:51:36] <kuudes> "president, but senate can fire them immediately and select a new president, and senate is a tad smaller"
[01:51:53] <Betawolf> this sound like monarchy but faster
[01:52:02] <kuudes> maybe
[01:52:15] <kuudes> that is the structure listed companies use
[01:52:45] <Betawolf> the issue you have is if the nobles split about whether to support the monarch and there's no quick dispute resolution system, you have a civil war
[01:52:49] <kuudes> stockholders elect the board, board selects and fires the ceo, specifies company strategy, ceo implements strategy

[01:54:59] <kuudes> I guess this sort of is used in parliamentarism, but usually the ceo is multiple persons, ie the cabinet
[01:55:24] <kuudes> ie the cabinet needs to enjoy the trust of the parliament, who can fire them with a majority
[01:55:50] <kuudes> and the parliament decides on the strategy, that is the laws

[03:47:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> I didn't say *he* deployed it to suggest general norms...
[03:48:13] <saturn2> "This got me wondering whether my default norm of the wizard’s code is something other people will even perceive as prosocial. Yes, indeed, I feel like not saying things is much more law-abiding than telling literal falsehoods. But if people feel just as wounded, or more wounded, then that policy isn’t really benefiting anyone else. It’s just letting me feel ethical and maybe being good for my own

[04:33:18] <Gurkenglas> LW: "<Will_Newsome> (...) outright complex hallucination (...)" aww he's just a loon
[04:35:48] <catern> it's more interesting to believe he's discovered one or more infohazards
[04:36:32] <gwern> my reasoning is that (male) tigers are apex predators, obligate carnivores, extremely large and expensive to feed, super-rare in captivity in general, extremely dangerous even if hand-reared and apparently totally safe and the handlers experienced (see: siegfried & roy), don't engage in recreational sex or noticeable masturbation as females go into heat and tigers have no pack or social...
[04:36:38] <gwern> ...dynamics; so there's just very little opportunity or reason for any woman to do it. compared to dogs who will literally hump your leg unasked...
[04:37:09] <saturn2> he wasn't always a loon, he made himself into one by thinking too hard about the simulation argument
[04:37:51] <gwern> like... how would you even go about it? you're not a female tiger so you can't fake estrus hormones or behavior.
[04:38:43] <gwern> valerian extract was supposedly used to hunt male tigers as an odor attractant to traps, leading to speculation about sex hormones, but that might lead it to investigate but hardly make him hump you
[04:39:03] <saturn2> strap yourself between the legs of a female tiger in heat
[04:39:27] <gwern> it's hard to rule out stuff permanently, but when you consider all the factors, I wouldn't be surprised if the final result multiplying it all out was simply zero
[04:39:52] <Gurkenglas> i don't expect thinking about the simulation argument would cause hallucinations? i guess *maybe* in *some* people seriously considering hypotheses involving gods eventually causes you to pay attention and amplify protohallucinations? but i would more expect that the failure cases would be to straightforwardly misreason yourself into a corner.

[04:45:44] <catern> unrelatedly, it seems to me that one of the big differences between fantasy and sci fi is that the latter considers philosophical-thought-experiment-style ethical dilemmas more often. why, I wonder?
[04:46:08] <Gurkenglas> "I want to minimize my credibility with most of LessWrong and semi-maximize my credibility with the people I consider elite." <- with this context that sounds sorta sensible - in order to make him more interesting to elites, he's signaling that he's trying to fail in more interesting ways than saying whatever will gain him credibility with the crowd

[04:53:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's empirically false

[04:55:24] <saturn2> this word, normal, i do not think it means what you think it means

[06:10:32] <gwern> ...stumbling on gold but being too incompetent to exploit it properly
[06:13:17] <gwern> that is, GITS was a huge success when shirow's vibe/mood was put in the hands of competent authors & directors, who couldn't hit on a good world but can write the plots and characters better than shirow woudl ever bother to. shirow's manga just trail off lamely, unable to do anything with the premise. _Kemono Friends_ was the same. it needs a lauren faust to reboot it

[10:02:16] <shawwwn> you surely have a phone number already

[10:02:45] <CoJaBo> PapuaHardyNet: Just buy a burner phone with a fake ID you buy off some guy on Telegram, simple enough.
[10:02:55] <two2thehead> No worries. I appreciate you mentioning it though. That is good
[10:03:16] <shawwwn> you can get burner phones on telegram too. so if you sign up now, you can say hello to dbohdan and then grab one later

[10:05:37] * feep[work] feels happy and validated
[10:05:37] <two2thehead> feep[work], is she cute? :V
[10:05:40] <feep[work]> XD
[10:05:55] <shawwwn> .note feep[work] in 1s can you really schedule a message in seconds?
[10:06:03] <shawwwn> lol.
[10:06:04] <feep[work]> aa
[10:06:05] <feepbot> feep[work]: shawwwn left a note 9 seconds ago: can you really schedule a message in seconds?
[10:06:15] <PapuaHardyNet> telegram blocks the general burner SMS phone numbers online. I don't know anyone reliable enough to get me a telegram phone number, so meh
[10:06:33] <shawwwn> yes that was annoying that they block those
[10:06:43] <shawwwn> which is why you should just relax and sign up for telegram with your phone number
[10:06:45] <feep[work]> two2thehead: aaanyway I have a stream of messages, and I'm parallelizing them based on a user-defined "aggregate key", so that the aggregate still only has to fulfill an idempotence guarantee 
[10:07:07] <feep[work]> ie. "we will tolerate receiving the same message twice in a row"; this is important to make crash recovery efficient
[10:07:36] <feep[work]> ie. we normally fulfill that guarantee per-stream but now we just fulfill it per-aggregate, which is not much harder
[10:07:56] <two2thehead> "Idempotence (UK: /ˌɪdɛmˈpoʊtəns/, US: /ˌaɪdəm-/) is the property of certain operations in mathematics and computer science whereby they can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application." hmm
[10:08:24] <adiabatic> two2thehead: "doing something one or ten or five million or three times is the same as doing something once"
[10:08:40] <feep[work]> anyway, the stream read distance is still tracked per stream, not per aggregate, so the clever thing is where I have to be a bit careful to check the idempotence guarantee relative to the *tracker position* rather than the progress
[10:08:47] * two2thehead adds that ELI5 definition to onenote
[10:08:50] <feep[work]> the aggregate progress*
[10:08:53] <two2thehead> adiabatic, +1
[10:08:56] <adiabatic> yw
[10:09:13] <feep[work]> two2thehead: the standard example I explain this with is the ABBC case, ie. I receive messages 1 2 3 4 with aggregate keys A B B C
[10:09:47] <feep[work]> so A1, B2 and C4 can start processing immediately, but B3 has to wait for *not* just B2, but also A1 to finish.
[10:10:06] <feep[work]> (because only once A1 is finished can we set the stream tracker position to 3)
[10:11:11] <feep[work]> this only makes it minimally slower than it could otherwise be though, as long as aggregate keys are approximately equally distributed
[10:11:54] * feep[work] goes grab some tea~
[10:15:10] <feep[work]> Genau. Die Annahme ist einfach auf sowas wie Prognosen oder Events pro Zugnummer gerichtet. Wenn es beispielsweise so wäre, dass ein Zug sich dauernd billig melden würde und ein anderer langsam verarbeitet würde, dann würde der langsame die Verarbeitungszeit des schnellen ausbremsen. (Weil wir "fast" noch sequentiell sind.) Da aber bsp Prognosen und auch Events relativ regelmäßig kommen, also 
[10:15:16] <feep[work]> zb nicht ein Zug im Minutentakt und einer im Sekundentakt, ist das kein Problem.
[10:15:19] <feep[work]> aaaa that was not supposed to be in my paste buffer

[10:16:25] <feep[work]> and this is how I learnt an important lesson about the selection paste buffer
[10:16:41] <feep[work]> namely: it's only filled if you actually reselect something, not just if the program shows it as selected
[10:16:56] <PapuaHardyNet> We should have a day in which everyone speaks one foreign language here

[10:17:04] <PapuaHardyNet> would really mess with the spooks

[10:17:32] <feep[work]> C-k? whyy

[10:17:45] <Obormot\Gaia> Selection paste buffer is lame and bad and wrong
[10:17:49] <Obormot\Gaia> I hate it
[10:17:50] <feep[work]> two2thehead: like, the city?
[10:18:01] <feep[work]> oh, it's a ship
[10:18:04] <feep[work]> sounded like a city XD
[10:18:18] <adiabatic> feep[work]: if I want to back up a bit and re-type I've gotten into the habit of holding option, pressing left a bunch, then killing to the end of the line
[10:18:24] <two2thehead> It's one of the heaviest ships in the ww2 german navy
[10:18:42] <feep[work]> hm, named for von Gneisenau, does that imply that Gneisenau is a place?
[10:19:04] <feep[work]> adiabatic: ^^
[10:19:23] <feep[work]> okay, it's definitely a place. good.

Vom einstigen Wasserschloss aus dem 16. und 17. Jahrhundert sind nur der massige Torturm und die Laubengänge im Hof originalnah erhalten geblieben.)
[10:20:10] <feep[work]> anyway, hm, how to explain the pronounciation
[10:20:27] <two2thehead> I got it from an audiobook, so it's fine
[10:20:34] <feep[work]> it's basically "ice an' now", but with a gn- at front
[10:20:46] <two2thehead> yep feep[work] +1
[10:21:01] <feep[work]> german pronounciation is pleasingly predictable 
[10:21:18] <feep[work]> (as usual, unless it isn't)
[10:21:32] <PapuaHardyNet> my eyes glaze over when I read german
[10:22:09] <feep[work]> we have a lot more, I think ... modifier letters?
[10:22:22] <feep[work]> like, the hr in jahr is basically one letter
[10:22:25] <adiabatic> diacritical marks
[10:22:36] <PapuaHardyNet> or translate it badly (the last line of robomot's message is like "100 years are only the massage torture and the laughing gang in the courtyard are orignally staying there")
[10:22:36] <feep[work]> nono I don't even mean those
[10:22:40] <adiabatic> oh
[10:22:41] <feep[work]> I mean like, combinations of two letters
[10:22:49] <adiabatic> have you heard our "I before E" rule?
[10:22:55] <adiabatic> …and the exceptions list?
[10:22:56] <feep[work]> like, ss is just an s with implications
[10:23:11] <PlanckWalk> "I before e except when it isn't"
[10:23:13] <feep[work]> ^^
[10:23:30] <feep[work]> seems like a weighty rule
[10:24:21] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: 100 years are only the massage torture and the laughing gang in the courtyard are originally staying here, but anyway, what's new with you mon-keighs
[10:24:24] <quanticle> I think all of those ships were named after people.
[10:24:47] <quanticle> Prominent generals or admirals (or in the case of Bismarck, statesmen) from German history
[10:24:54] <Obormot\Gaia> i before e, except after c, or when sounds like an ey, as in neighbor and weigh
[10:25:30] <PlanckWalk> counterfeit?

[10:25:38] <Obormot\Gaia> yes, exactly

[10:25:42] <Obormot\Gaia> after c
[10:25:45] <PlanckWalk> Err what?
[10:25:49] <feep[work]> it's a joke
[10:26:03] <adiabatic> exceptions (all the same way: 'neither leisure foreigner seized the weird height')
[10:26:07] <feep[work]> the rule just ... like, "when sounds like ey" where "ey" is just how ei pronounced
[10:26:25] <Obormot\Gaia> feep[work]: ey like, you know
[10:26:29] <Obormot\Gaia> EYYYYY *finger guns*
[10:26:31] <feep[work]> Obormot\Gaia: XD
[10:27:06] <quanticle> "weird" is one of those words that I have to type both ways, "weird" "wierd" in order to remember which one doesn't look... weird
[10:27:34] <Obormot\Gaia> quanticle: It helps if you remember that "weird" descends from "wyrd"
[10:27:43] <Obormot\Gaia> quanticle: And by "helps" I mean the opposite of that
[10:27:43] <PlanckWalk> I like "deities" since it has both :)
[10:27:56] <PlanckWalk> (Or "feistier")
[10:27:59] <quanticle> "occasion" is another. I keep wanting to type "ocassion", because I know that "caisson" is also a real word
[10:28:11] <adiabatic> french isn't real
[10:28:23] <feep[work]> there's a german rule where [vowel]ss is a short vowel
[10:28:24] <adiabatic> you have quebec-borne brain worms
[10:28:29] <adiabatic> we don't get those in socal
[10:28:29] <feep[work]> whereas [vowel]s is a long one
[10:28:39] <feep[work]> pleasingly, this makes occasion work out correctly too
[10:28:47] <feep[work]> occ (short vowel) as (long vowel)ion
[10:29:20] <Obormot\Gaia> quanticle: It's gotta be occasion because it's pronounced long-a and not short-a. You know the open-syllable / closed-syllable rule?
[10:29:23] <feep[work]> unfortunately, mocassin torpedoes this idea.

[10:32:47] <quanticle> feep[work]: I'm sure you *think* you have good reasons, but your good reasons are actually bad reasons
[10:32:58] <feep[work]> quanticle: like "there literally was no other way to do it"
[10:33:06] <Obormot\Gaia> Sounds made-up
[10:33:10] <quanticle> Look, I'm sure that Amazon also thought it had good reasons when it went with Brazil... but no, they were all bad reasons and led to bad outcomes.
[10:33:34] <Obormot\Gaia> Yeah. That movie was scary
[10:33:49] <spxtr> Nominative determinism is the best reason for Amazon to go to Brazil.
[10:34:10] <feep[work]> quanticle: well, the underlying problem is that we want to do reproducible builds and also we've never heard of nix and docker is useful but also kind of shit.
[10:34:12] <quanticle> You all do realize that the name "Brazil" was chosen specifically for the pun, right?
[10:34:26] <Obormot\Gaia> I mean, obviously
[10:34:50] <spxtr> I binged Jojo's part 6 last night. It was pretty great.
[10:35:19] <quanticle> Okay, but why do you need to roll your own package management system in order to have reproducible builds?

[10:48:08] <Robomot> The bonds of family and community: Poverty and cruelty among Russian peasants in the late 19th century | LessWrong [mingyuan on 29 Nov 2021 21:51 UTC: «The question for me is how much these observations apply to peasant life in other places and at other times.»Most of this sounds a lot like my dad’s life in China in the 1970s. I don’t know about infanticide or some of the other things, but the impression  …]
[10:55:43] <quanticle> "The better-off peasants are bitter about the attitude of their poorer neighbors. 'They hate and envy us constantly, saying things like: "What makes you think you’re so much better? Just wait, you’re going to be as poor as us." If you plant an apple tree, they resent it, saying: "Now that big shot is planting an orchard! We are starving while he is putting in an orchard, and fencing it off
[10:55:45] <quanticle> at that!"' And they think nothing of breaking down the fence and uprooting the tree. If the tree happens to survive and bear fruit, they feel it is their duty to raid it. 'That’s how much hate they have! And if some misfortune should befall you, they’ll make sure to finish you off.'"
[10:55:47] <quanticle> Sounds like the old joke about a Russian peasant who finds a genie. The genie grants the peasant a wish. The peasant says, "Well, my neighbor Ivan has two cows, but I only have one..." So the genie replies, "So you want me to grant you another cow?" The peasant replies, "What? No, I want you to kill one of Ivan's cows."
[10:55:57] <nshepperd2> Obormot\Arcturus: wow

[11:02:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Having one of your posts included in said books
[11:04:43] <saturn2> makes sense
[11:05:30] <ggreer> not a "since the 90s" improvement (https://www.gwern.net/Improvements) but apparently *sniper* rifles 50 years ago had accuracy of 3 minutes of angle. if you bought a rifle today with 3 minutes of angle of accuracy, you'd return it as defective
[11:05:30] <Robomot> My Ordinary Life: Improvements Since the 1990s · Gwern.net (A list of unheralded improvements to ordinary quality-of-life since the 1990s going beyond computers.)
[11:06:15] <ggreer> pretty much anything you buy today will be 1moa
[11:06:25] <nshepperd2> inequality is good, actually, being redistribution of resources toward people who are able to turn resources into more resources, away from people who can only destroy
[11:07:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: Is that true because of modern designs that are different from the ones then, or from improvements that can be / have been applied to rifles that've been produced since then and continue to be?
[11:08:06] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd2: turning resources into more resources is not an unquestionably good thing smh
[11:08:07] <ggreer> our manufacturing and metallurgy is much better. if anything our designs are fundamentally less accurate but cheaper/easier to manufacture
[11:08:12] <PapuaHardyNet> I thought we have established that by now
[11:08:28] <ggreer> also guns & ammo were much more expensive long ago, so a sniper from WWII was probably about as competent as a civilian enthusiast today
[11:08:36] <ggreer> because they didn't get that much training
[11:08:47] <nshepperd2> PapuaHardyNet: wrong
[11:08:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: Interesting
[11:08:53] <quanticle> ggreer: Yeah, that's something that Ian McCollum talks about when discussing firearms from World War 1. He notes that their sights are graduated out to like 800 or 1200 meters, but there's basically no way you'd be able to hit something at that range with a Lee Enfield or whatever.
[11:08:59] <PapuaHardyNet> okay
[11:09:01] <nshepperd2> unless it involves turning paperclips into more paperclips
[11:09:07] <nshepperd2> then maybe not

[11:17:47] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm sure there is a term for that sort of ethics where it all reduces to what certain people think is good and what they think is bad
[11:17:53] <quanticle> feep[work]: Oh?
[11:18:17] <feep[work]> quanticle: like, it seems pretty clear the comments are like "yeah it means you lose in a fair matchup, but random situations you find yourself in can easily be made unfair"
[11:18:52] <feep[work]> ie. the guy who was like "with skill a bolt action can be pretty fast" they're not saying a bolt action is *better* than a semiauto, they're saying it can be *sufficient* against a semiauto wielded by an inexperienced thug
[11:18:54] <quanticle> No, the point he's making is that any real-world situation where a bolt action is up against a semi-auto is unfair... in favor of the semi-auto
[11:19:11] <feep[work]> yes, but it doesn't matter because it's a satisficing situation, not a tournament
[11:19:34] <feep[work]> I think the background sentiment is something like "how fucked are we if we only have a bolt action"
[11:19:50] <feep[work]> and I think the commenter is saying "somewhat but not as much as you'd think"
[11:19:56] <feep[work]> and I think ian is just totally not getting this.
[11:20:20] <quanticle> I mean, I guess if all you have is your grandfather's trusty SMLE and you're going up against the neo-fascist thugs armed with M16s (or the neo-commies armed with AK-74s), yeah, sure, but... really the solution to that is shoot the first neo-* thug and take his rifle 
[11:20:32] <feep[work]> the whole "pressed into service against the government" is like ... the assumption is you *cannot get* a semiauto, presumably because of bans
[11:20:44] <feep[work]> quanticle: RIGHT, AND THAT WAS A COMMENT TOO.
[11:20:59] <feep[work]> which is what I mean, it seems very clear where the commenters are coming from.
[11:21:29] <feep[work]> it's like, "you start combat with a bolt-action. can you win?"
[11:21:37] <feep[work]> and that's a *very* different question from what ian is answering.
[11:22:19] <quanticle> No, the commenters come off as a bunch of folks who think they're Simo Hayaa and can take down a Soviet paratroop division armed with nothing more than a Mosin-Nagant and snow
[11:22:26] <feep[work]> sure.
[11:22:33] <feep[work]> but that's *also* unrelated to ian's answers!
[11:22:41] <quanticle> (Fun fact: Most of Simo's kills were with a SMG)
[11:22:49] <feep[work]> (Fun fact: yes!)
[11:23:01] <feep[work]> It's like, you think you're disagreeing but you're not, ian isn't either
[11:23:15] <feep[work]> this whole video is "ian enthusiastically misses the point"

[11:24:40] <feep[work]> (compiling!)
[11:24:41] <PapuaHardyNet> oh makes sense
[11:27:08] <quanticle> feep[work]: I guess what Ian is trying to get at is that, at least in the US, this scenario where all you have is a bolt-action and the government is hunting you with semi-auto armed troops is... a bit unrealistic? And kinda LARP-y? And he's more interested in like... realistic military combat scenarios not fantasy LARPs

Like, this idea that the gubbmint takes away all semi-autos and then all you have to fight with are bolt-actions (until you can secure more

[14:01:58] <feep> ~*
[14:04:24] <shawwwn> I'm getting increasingly sad that Logos isn't getting unbanned here 
[14:04:34] <shawwwn> I don't know what to do.
[14:05:14] <shawwwn> I even tried to bribe saturn, but he seems uninterested in money
[14:05:40] <Gurkenglas> Might there be some way of generalizing the stopped-clock illusion to do illusionary time travel on longer scales?
[14:06:13] <feep> it is possible that there is nothing to be done.
[14:06:15] <two2thehead> shawwwn, ...really? :V
[14:06:39] <shawwwn> but ever since you pointed out it's unfair, I haven't been able to stop thinking about it
[14:07:15] <shawwwn> plus I miss him.
[14:07:37] <feep> yeah. well he`s in #lw-fandom at least
[14:08:26] <Gurkenglas> Convincing me would shift public opinion marginally! What'd he do/why was it unfair?
[14:08:59] <shawwwn> "even the most comfortable prison is still a prison." he'd be here by choice
[14:09:01] <feep> to a first approximation, be annozing
[14:09:05] <feep> annoying*
[14:09:26] <shawwwn> yeah. which is way less worse than anything I did.
[14:09:40] <shawwwn> but it's also arguably not even his fault. he has autism
[14:09:42] <feep> like, that was not the actual reason, but the actual reason was so dumb I`ll ignore it
[14:09:52] <Gurkenglas> Then the obvious suggestion for you to make is to ban you in his place :V
[14:10:09] <feep> yes, which is why I complained at length about the illegibility and discontinuity of the mod decision afterwards
[14:10:11] <shawwwn> that's actually the same conclusion I've come to
[14:10:28] <shawwwn> which is why I'm sad about it
[14:10:33] <Gurkenglas> ...who here doesn't have autism
[14:10:38] <PapuaHardyNet> me? I hope
[14:10:42] <feep> tbf logos01 has like, turbo autism
[14:10:44] <feep> aka autism
[14:10:53] <shawwwn> well, there's a difference between actual autism and internet autism
[14:11:04] <feep> I definitely have internet autism
[14:11:39] <shawwwn> the whole "ban without ever getting a second chance" is for the birds
[14:11:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> The actual reason was not dumb
[14:11:52] <feep> uh, the actual reason was extremely dumb
[14:11:55] <shawwwn> may as well be xi
[14:11:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> no u
[14:12:06] <feep> like, if you really say like
[14:12:28] <feep> `logos01 was banned for being confidently wrong about air conditioners`
[14:12:52] <feep> there is no way to make that not sound stupid
[14:12:53] <shawwwn> I actually laughed out loud
[14:13:04] <feep> THAT IS NOT A JOKE, TO BE CLEAR. THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED.
[14:13:32] <Gurkenglas> surely it's more like "he didn't estimate social capital expenditure like others do"
[14:13:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> It doesn't sound stupid
[14:13:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> It sounds and is correct
[14:13:56] <shawwwn> well, yes, because autism
[14:13:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> You're just understating it
[14:14:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> He was very confidently very wrong
[14:14:15] <Gurkenglas> your turn to overstate it!
[14:14:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> About very air conditioners.
[14:14:43] <shawwwn> he's been a member of #lesswrong for some ridiculous length of time. Like 5x longer than me, and I've been here years now
[14:15:08] <shawwwn> getting banned from a community like that can really get to you.
[14:15:20] <shawwwn> so my empathy meter has been going off the scale for a little while now.
[14:15:29] <Gurkenglas> do we really want an AC-themed supervillain
[14:15:38] <feep> we must protect the community from his air conditioning hot takes tho
[14:16:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Obviously, because what we need from air conditioning is cold takes
[14:17:07] <Gurkenglas> did he... use his wrong beliefs to inform naively consequentialist bannable actions?
[14:17:39] * Obormot\Arcturus tries to parse that question
[14:18:00] <PapuaHardyNet> i swear, gurkenglas deliberately tries to be as obtuse as possible as a signalling mechanism
[14:18:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean... yes? Insofar as his beliefs informed his... words
[14:18:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> That he typed. Into the chat.
[14:18:41] <shawwwn> gurk is acute
[14:18:45] <shawwwn> I like the way he phrases things
[14:19:02] <Gurkenglas> where "as possible" means "as succinctly as i expect will be understood", and i keep being wrong about that...
[14:19:10] <Gurkenglas> although you don't see all the times i'm right.
[14:20:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, communication is hard
[14:20:41] <Gurkenglas> Let me expand. I don't expect a literal opinion gets you banned, so I expected that his opinion *caused* his banning indirectly, such as by: his opinion caused him to decide that, like, all air conditioners must be destroyed, and then he proceeded to... doxx those users of air conditioners who most stand out
[14:20:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... no
[14:20:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nothing like that
[14:21:27] <feep> no look
[14:21:32] <shawwwn> as far as I can tell, saturn2 is secretly stalin and everyone is afraid of him. And he happened to dislike logos enough to initiate a ban
[14:21:44] <feep> logos01 talked a lot about stuff that nobody cared about but was too nice to tell him this
[14:21:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> It was just like feep said, except with the addition of being impervious to having his wrongness demonstrated, continuing to say dumb, demonstrated-to-be-totally-wrong shit, etc.
[14:21:54] <feep> the air conditioner thing was just a really transparent excuse
[14:21:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> no
[14:22:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't know why you think this, tbh
[14:22:11] * feep shrugs
[14:22:31] <feep> my social cognition doesn`t explain itself. projection?
[14:22:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> The AC thing was not unique, but it was an instance of a specific pattern, not just, like, "this guy is lame lol"
[14:22:44] <shawwwn> but it's harmless to talk about unrelated topics
[14:23:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Personally I wish he'd come back
[14:23:06] <shawwwn> especially air conditioners
[14:23:16] <feep> see the reason this makes no sense to me is
[14:23:23] <Gurkenglas> Ah. It sure is unfair to ban someone after people are too nice to give lesser negative feedback.
[14:23:28] <feep> people are wrong in here like, allllll the time!
[14:23:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: That is NOT what happened
[14:23:46] <shawwwn> (yes. me chief among them)
[14:23:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: There was *tons* of feedback about the thing that led to the ban (was it even a ban or a +q??)
[14:23:55] <feep> shit if we banned people for confidently asserted wrong hot takes, surely obormot would-- I mean, you see what I mean
[14:23:58] <Gurkenglas> shawwwn being wrong once again
[14:24:07] <Gurkenglas> smh
[14:24:10] <shawwwn> yis
[14:24:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: But no, we wouldn't, though
[14:24:30] <shawwwn> the problem is concentration of power
[14:24:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because the problem wasn't just "being wrong", it was... come on, man
[14:24:50] <shawwwn> somehow saturn2 has become the respected leader of lesswrong. I'm not sure how
[14:24:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> You know perfectly well what it was
[14:24:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't know why you're pretending not to
[14:25:12] <feep> what I said was accurate to my perception.
[14:25:12] <shawwwn> which is fine, when he has everyone's interests at heart
[14:25:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't even believe you -_-
[14:25:23] <feep> oy.
[14:26:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> (It was a +q, though, wasn't it?)
[14:26:24] <shawwwn> well, it's true though. If it was put to a vote, I bet it would be almost unanimous that logos should be unbanned (with explicit conditions and guidelines that he needs to follow)
[14:26:26] <feep> +q is a ban..
[14:26:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... no
[14:26:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> What?
[14:26:37] <shawwwn> yes it is
[14:26:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> +q is quiet
[14:27:08] <feep> yes, which is the same, ban is not a separate thing
[14:27:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uhhh no?
[14:27:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> +b is ban.
[14:27:39] <PapuaHardyNet> there's also kick
[14:27:41] <shawwwn> no doubt obormot is being his usual wonderful self.
[14:27:47] * shawwwn considers unignoring
[14:27:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... feep are you doing some sort of rhetorical thing right now or do you actually suddenly not know how IRC works
[14:28:11] <feep> I genuinely believe +q is how bans work
[14:28:23] <shawwwn> when one person seizes power, there's very little anyone else can do when they won't listen to reason
[14:28:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow
[14:28:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just... how
[14:28:38] <shawwwn> it's a bit ironic for a channel like #lesswrong to succumb to it
[14:28:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok time to find the libera.chat channel modes documentation I guess
[14:29:00] <feep> tbf, I`d still rather have mods than not mods.
[14:29:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: https://libera.chat/guides/channelmodes
[14:29:12] <Robomot> Channel Modes | Libera Chat (Various modes can be set on channels. Use /mode #channel to list current channel modes and /msg chanserv info #channel to list modes set with MLOCK.)
[14:29:24] <PapuaHardyNet> what you want is mod voting
[14:29:25] <shawwwn> yes. but it's not a shield for bad behavior.
[14:29:43] <feep> meh, I`ve said my piece about the decision.
[14:32:14] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: oh, I think I see what happened
[14:32:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, to review: +b is not the same as +q; +b is ban, +q is quiet; I am pretty sure Logos01 was +q'd, NOT +b'd, and that he subsequently left because he was pissed off about being +q'd
[14:34:27] <feep> when I learnt about modes, I saw somebody being +b'd, and I was like, oh they're still here? .... oh, it just means they can't talk
[14:34:37] <feep> (hence ban vs kickban)
[14:34:54] <Gurkenglas> iirc when +b'd you can't rejoin
[14:35:00] <feep> exactly
[14:35:11] <feep> why it doesn't autopart you I still don't know
[14:35:46] <shawwwn> I think I'll make this more of an issue leading up to Christmas. It's pretty inhumane for Logos to be excluded from the yearly christmas party
[14:35:47] <Gurkenglas> less literal lines of code while allowing the same mod actions? :3
[14:35:50] <feep> anyway, break over, back to work~
[14:36:07] <feep[work]> man my worktrip is short now.
[14:36:39] <PapuaHardyNet> is a 66% reduction in time taken a 133% perf increase?
[14:37:26] <feep[work]> 51% surely?
[14:37:50] <feep[work]> oh wait no
[14:38:00] <feep[work]> that's hm
[14:38:01] <kuudes> if previously thing took 100 units of time and now takes 33 units, surely perf has improved to 3x of before
[14:38:05] <feep[work]> 150% improvement, 33% reduction
[14:38:08] <kuudes> so +200%
[14:38:22] <feep[work]> oh, reduction to 66% or by 66%?
[14:38:41] <kuudes> also exp(-ln(1/3)) = 3/1
[14:38:50] <PapuaHardyNet> by 66% yeah
[14:38:53] <Gurkenglas> 3 times as many feeps at work in the same time. say, why did you decrease your productivity once at work by a factor of 3 at the same time?
[14:38:56] <feep[work]> jeez, yeah that's a tripling
[14:39:11] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: hehe
[14:39:15] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: I think we all know why :3
[14:39:32] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, so it is 100/33 times increase in perf

[17:20:15] <PapuaHardyNet> it is really hard to calculate the counterfactual
[17:20:49] <PapuaHardyNet> (as in, was your decision and your efforts really all that beneficial given a specific situation?)
[17:20:59] <dv^_^> today's AoC task is very simple
[17:21:02] <PapuaHardyNet> (what would have happened if you had taken an alternate strategy?)
[17:26:42] <kuudes> our health authority in its high grace has today allowed all 18 year olds to get a third dose when 5-6 months from their second dose has passed
[17:27:13] <kuudes> in other similar high news, health authority in its high grace has allowed 5-11 years olds who are personally in high risk group, are allowed to be vaccinated
[17:27:52] <kuudes> and in their high grace they also recommend the government to change statute so that such 5-11 year olds whose family has persons in autoimmune risk group will be allowed to be vaccinated
[17:28:47] <kuudes> health authority in its infinite wisdom proclaims that the vaccine is clearly net safe for all people at least 5 year old, but that there is not enough safety data for it to be allowed for general population of 5-11 years olds
[17:29:38] <kuudes> also health authority estimates that before q2/22 20-40% of 5-11 year olds will have got the disease naturally. so clearly they will then lower need for it.
[17:29:48] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[17:30:59] <kuudes> oh how blessed we are to have this wise and gracious health authority and its chief vaxxinologist.
[17:31:13] <two2thehead> how does the omicron variant affect that last part?
[17:31:36] <kuudes> possibly for worse; but our health authority denies of seeking herd immunity through infecting kids.
[17:31:48] <two2thehead> feep[work], when you are free check my messages please
[17:32:20] <two2thehead> kuudes, wouldn't vaccinations && infection be the best option? IE shouldn't you vaccinate anyway?

[17:35:04] <kuudes> no because health authority has in its high wisdom decided against
[17:35:15] <two2thehead> :-/
[17:35:19] <kuudes> all while over here there is an active epidemic specifically in kids aged 5-9
[17:35:25] <kuudes> fucking deathist murderers.
[17:35:40] * two2thehead hugs kuudes 
[17:35:59] <kuudes> we currently have over here at least 1100 /100k in 5-9 years olds here in Oulu, ie every week at least 1.1% of those kids gets covid
[17:36:11] <kuudes> and increasing with nice R
[17:36:31] <kuudes> so indeed in q2 there won't be about anyone who has not got it here.
[17:36:59] <kuudes> the health authority denies that they would be seeking herd immunity through deliberately infecting children, when journalists have directly asked this
[17:37:45] <kuudes> also afaik our local head doctor is in criminal investigation by police about derelict of duties and causing general harm and indirect assaults

[21:50:47] <ggreer> 19? yeah that sounds about right
[21:51:07] <feep> yeah bout same level
[21:51:37] <feep> some of the questions are problematic.
[21:52:08] <feep> like, `I find it easy to tell if people are getting bored~
[21:52:11] <feep> `*
[21:52:31] <feep> turboautist: `yeah that`s super easy, though it happens really rarely`
[21:53:14] <feep> oh, I was looking at the wrong page XD 16ish
[21:53:30] <feep> that bout fits
[21:56:43] <shawwwn> Well, that settles it. Fellow friends, enemies, colleagues, proteges, and mentors, today I come to lesswrong to talk about a subject of passing importance. Autists everywhere -- a subject that concerns us all --  are under attack from a new threat, one that lay dormant for many years but nonetheless has come to fruition. Yes, I'm unfortunately talking about our glorious leader, saturn2. As we all know, he has done a fine service for 
[21:56:43] <shawwwn> us, and has been an otherwise exceptional leader. But recently, two of us have fallen to his cruel tendencies. One of us was pardoned and given a second chance; the other was not. I'm organizing a Christmas protest, and I urge you as fellow autists to band together with me in solidarity for Logos01. For it is not him we fight for, nor me, but for all of us; for the very future of #lesswrong, for the security of autists everywhere, 
[21:56:43] <shawwwn> and for anime-style justice. Will our friend be excluded from the festivities, or will he be allowed to talk about air conditioners in the comfort of our own homes? Only you can help make a difference. Thank you for your time.
[21:56:59] <catern> i really desperately need to find more intelligent people to talk to
[21:57:15] <catern> my thinking-glands are primarily stimulated by arguing with people

[22:16:20] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: surprisingly delayed reaction
[22:17:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: As soon as I read it...
[22:17:32] <catern> but I was really talking about my coworkers anyway, about talking about programming stuff related to $DAYJOB
[22:17:56] <Filipepe> apply to MIRI
[22:20:20] <Filipepe> they've been offering remote jobs to programmers for a good (at least it seems to me) salary
[22:20:43] <catern> maybe after I retire
[22:23:44] <PapuaHardyNet> catern: why do you want intellectual stimulation from your coworkers about programming stuff?
[22:23:59] <catern> because my thinking-glands are primarily stimulated by arguing with people
[22:24:10] <PapuaHardyNet> is that something you really want to optimize for? that may involve sacrificing other things that may benefit you
[22:24:12] <catern> and I argue the most with my coworkers
[22:24:24] <PapuaHardyNet> man, argue with yourself
[22:24:31] <catern> i already do-
[22:25:19] <catern> but it seems to be a core part of my being, that I make intellectual progress by being in an argument and having to come up with arguments to marshal against the enemy
[22:26:39] <Filipepe> I was like that when I was, like, 18. Now (31) I've changed... though I may be having less intellectual progress than I had before
[22:26:40] <PapuaHardyNet> wait for an year, we'll have a GPT-3 simulated version of better-catern
[22:26:50] <PapuaHardyNet> you'll love arguing with him (or her)
[22:28:31] <PapuaHardyNet> Filipepe: intellectual progress is overrated in our circles. Is intellectual progress meaning-of-life level important to you? Usually intellectual progress is only indirectly useful to your goals and your life, and that is okay
[22:28:50] <feep> define intellectual
[22:29:22] <PapuaHardyNet> finally, you don't have any more work
[22:29:54] <Filipepe> PapuaHardyNet: it's the thing I care the most. It may not be the most important thing for most people, but I'm fundamentally an intellectual nerd, even if not the most talented intellectual nerd

[22:30:33] <catern> see, it's not that weird, I should lean into it
[22:31:07] <PapuaHardyNet> Filipepe: is it social or not? If you intellectually progress but no one you care about or respect or is in your social circle notices, does it still make you feel pride?
[22:32:30] <Filipepe> it's very hard to know if it's a terminal value or socially motivated, to gain respect
[22:32:46] <PapuaHardyNet> that is easy to test, actually
[22:34:16] <PapuaHardyNet> I recommend testing it. Do what counts as "intellectual progress" for a month or two, and actively forbit yourself from using it socially. See how that affects your desire for intellectual progress
[22:34:55] <PapuaHardyNet> sidenote, I am treating "intellectual progress" as a black box here because as feep said, this is a vague term, and I do not have a concrete understanding of what it means for Filipepe to have intellectual progress

[22:43:05] <milanandreew> it feels very muddy

[22:50:52] <milanandreew> Thanks for the paper. I think the problem is exacerbated by me and my peers not really knowing shit about what we're discussing and just using the concept as a talking point. maybe school just tends to encourage these kinds of discussions where everyone argues totally removed from reality
[22:51:25] <gwern> the question is, what do people mean by emergence which isn't just reductionism?
[22:51:50] <spxtr> milanandreew: Philosophy class at a university? Definitely at least a few steps removed from reality.
[22:52:30] <Filipepe> https://newatlas.com/collectibles/botto-ai-art/ <-- people using RiversHaveWings 's models to make millions
[22:52:30] <Robomot> Botto, the decentralized AI/human artist, makes its first million (An AI algorithm called Botto has made somewhere around US$1.3 million at auction for its first six NFT artworks. Botto generates thousands of images, and a community of humans vote to influence its direction and decide which pieces go to auction.)
[22:53:40] <gwern> Filipepe: eh. it's like that smeary GAN portrait some guys sold. the portrait was shit. what they got the $1m or whatever for was being plugged into high art circles and doing marketing
[22:54:50] <gwern> Filipepe: so here I see Instagram, its own cryptocurrency, community-building, presumably some Discords...
[22:55:18] <shawwwn> Filipepe: Are you feeling a bit better yet? I was worried about you
[22:55:29] <RiversHaveWings> it's one of my older methods too
[22:55:39] <RiversHaveWings> i have been able to do way better since around summer
[22:55:56] <RiversHaveWings> but maybe not at 2048x2048 like they want
[22:56:13] <milanandreew> gwern: something about those phenomena appearing at a higher level of abstraction without the lower levels having anything to do about it. I don't quite get why you can't view a phenomenon on a lower level, but people seem to believe you'd miss something. It comes up a lot when discussing consciousness, which some of my peers believe to be a property inherent to humans and non-replicable... I'll admit I don't quite get it
[22:56:43] <Filipepe> maybe Rivers could copy them business wise and explicitly argue, in a public and combative way that she's the real deal, and get millions,
[22:56:53] <gwern> I think the mystical emergence is obviously just wrong. show me Firefox 'emerging' independent of a very carefully arranged hard drive and CPU of billions of transistors
[22:57:38] <Filipepe> shawwwn: my face is just the same, half-paralized. I'm going to the doctor tomorrow. I'll ask him to do more exams
[22:57:53] <milanandreew> maybe they think that computers are qualitatively different from other systems, because I've already tried taking that route
[22:58:21] <shawwwn> I hope you feel better soon <3
[22:58:25] <feep> my stance is it`s map territory confusion
[22:58:32] <feep> it`s usually map territory confusion
[22:58:44] <feep> people don`t reason via logic, they reason by examining the primitives in their head
[22:59:13] <Filipepe> thanks~
[22:59:26] <feep> self is a primitive. they cannot imagine self arising from neurons, so self must be irreducible. etc
[23:00:18] <milanandreew> abstraction layers aren't real, but some abstraction layers appear impermeable and must therefore be causally removed from everything else
[23:00:26] <feep> exactly
[23:00:49] <milanandreew> seems like a position difficult to reason people out of
[23:01:06] <feep> took me years to reason myself out of it :p

[23:03:09] <milanandreew> also my teacher told me to restrict myself to three sentences per raised hand max, because I talk too much.
[23:03:26] <gwern> 'oh god its milanandreew again'
[23:03:41] <milanandreew> I believe that's the general sentiment, yes :v
[23:03:43] <feep> that`s a great challenge tho
[23:04:02] <milanandreew> fortunately I'm very good at hypotaxis
[23:04:08] <feep> like a puzzle, find the smallest sentence that creates the most stress
[23:04:42] <gwern> and good training for your future career as a twitter auteur/autist
[23:04:50] <RiversHaveWings> "In philosophy, systems theory, science, and art, emergence occurs when an entity is observed to have properties its parts do not have on their own, properties or behaviors which emerge only when the parts interact in a wider whole." this seems like. critically dependent on what exactly a "property" is
[23:05:10] *** Quits: otthorn (otthorn@zamok.crans.org) (Quit: Ping timeout (120 seconds))
[23:06:49] <RiversHaveWings> "In terms of physical systems, weak emergence is a type of emergence in which the emergent property is amenable to computer simulation or similar forms of after-the-fact analysis (for example, the formation of a traffic jam, the structure of a flock of starlings in flight or a school of fish, or the formation of galaxies). Crucial in these simulations is that the interacting members retain their independence. If not, a new entity is 
[23:06:49] <RiversHaveWings> formed with new, emergent properties: this is called strong emergence, which it is argued cannot be simulated or analysed." The actual what.
[23:06:50] <milanandreew> don't the properties of parts result from interactions of (parts of parts)?
[23:07:55] <feep> RiversHaveWings: yeah see this makes sense
[23:08:24] <feep> if you look at it as "this person is just turbo not noticing that they`re just looking at their map"
[23:08:39] <milanandreew> I thought the correct definition was basically an admission that it'd be very complex to view it reductively, so we're just going to say that it's very complicated and not going to bother with it for now
[23:08:54] <feep> that`s weak emergence
[23:08:59] <feep> like the ant highway
[23:09:20] <milanandreew> I didn't know `strong emergence` is a widely accepted concept
[23:09:26] <milanandreew> wow
[23:09:33] <feep> we can only hope and pray that it isn`t actually
[23:09:36] <RiversHaveWings> I am not sure it is

[23:28:34] <RiversHaveWings> Like has anyone ever just tried training a 2048x2048 StyleGAN.
[23:28:48] <RiversHaveWings> I am not sure they have
[23:29:08] <rmmh> makes sense, since even if lots of phones generate 12MP+ images they're not exactly all crispy

[23:29:44] <gwern> obscure fashion company, iirc
[23:29:47] <RiversHaveWings> and for diffusion models it seems to be much harder to make ones larger than 256x256
[23:29:50] <RiversHaveWings> oh, did it work?
[23:30:00] <gwern> wanted high-res faces. their paper claimed it did
[23:30:04] <RiversHaveWings> like, i have trained 512x512 ones and openai did too
[23:30:25] <RiversHaveWings> but like... they have increasing problems with learning global coherence as their size goes up
[23:30:28] <catern> rmmh: did you like that bene grifterit
[23:31:08] <RiversHaveWings> i'm experimenting with a new architecture that i have some hope can model global properties of images at higher resolutions more easily
[23:31:17] <rmmh> yes thanks you catern 
[23:32:08] <rmmh> I wonder if there's some way you can make the architecture do a lapped/fractal scaling thing
[23:32:32] <RiversHaveWings> wdym?
[23:33:04] <RiversHaveWings> The current solution is to train a smaller resolution base diffusion model and then separate diffusion upscalers conditioned on the low res images
[23:33:08] <RiversHaveWings> But this is kinda bad imo
[23:33:30] <PapuaHardyNet> I agree, it is bad
[23:33:46] <PapuaHardyNet> there isn't enough compute for a 2048x2048 model?
