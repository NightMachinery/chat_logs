[17:03:58] <max__> Good day everyone! So I am using ggplot2 and I want to do a density plot but... my data is already summarized in buckets (lo,hi,count variables). I can’t figure out how to plot this using geom_desnity. Halp?!
[17:05:19] <flip214> max__: geom_bin_2d perhaps?
[17:06:17] <flip214> or "manually" via geom_polygon, I guess
[17:06:40] <flip214> max__: geom_tile looks good. https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_tile.html
[17:09:26] <max__> I feel like I should be able to tell geom_density that the counts are precomputed somehow via the stat/after_stat stuff but maybe that’s not a usecase anyone had in mind.
[17:10:03] <fendur> if the counts are pre-computed, im not sure you can get a proper density plot easily. you could do a bar chart easily.
[17:10:29] <max__> I could just inflate the data with the rows geom_density expects but that would lead to a HUGE (multi GB csv) frame.
[17:10:48] <max__> How’d you go about the bar chart?
[17:21:22] <fendur> e.g., barchart( c(5,2,10,3) ) as a basic thing
[17:22:05] <fendur> that's not ggplot. i know very little about ggplot because god gave us base graphics and that was all we needed
[17:22:29] <fendur> jk. i wouldn't really attribute that to god.
[17:25:07] <max__> sorta figured it out using geom_col

[21:40:35] <Bayes> docstrings in the line before the function definition or within the function definition? fight!
[21:43:25] <Bayes> so I sometimes struggle seeing the point in function factories
[21:44:16] <Bayes> starting with f(x, n), why would I want a function factory over f1 <- function(x) { f(x, 1) }?
[21:44:29] <rickyrick> No docstrings at all :^)
[21:44:33] <Bayes> when trying to specify one variable, in this case n = 1
[21:44:58] <rickyrick> There's a couple cases where I use function factories
[21:45:06] <rickyrick> It's usually to bake in a dataset or model or something
[21:46:44] <Bayes> like fit_mymodel <- function(x, y, model) { function(x, y) { fit_model(x, y, model) } } ?

[22:15:11] <Bayes> rickyrick gotcha, and that differs from the following approach because you can create many ModelXPred functions? eval_model = function(data) { predict(data, model) }?
[22:15:59] <rickyrick> Yep
[22:16:18] <rickyrick> And I can model_list %>% lapply(eval_model) %>% lapply(data_list)
[22:16:54] <Bayes> is model_list a list of objects?
[22:17:03] <rickyrick> List of models
[22:17:41] <Bayes> yeah objects returned by your many different fit_modelX function
[22:17:44] <Bayes> s
[22:17:56] <Bayes> also, that seems to give you a nested list, is that right?
