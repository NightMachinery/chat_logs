[00:50:10] <DPA> No. It doesn't matter if input and output has a 1:1 correspondence. It doesn't for compilers, transpilers & co. either. It's not just a summary of predetermined output metrics either, it really does use & transform others code MS doesn't own.
[00:50:16] <ljharb> sheetjs: how is that impacted by what we've been talking about?

[00:51:10] <worst> type script question -  is there a way to declare a type like    HTTPResponse<T> = { T: T }  where I can I pass in "Person" as T and expect HTTPResponse<Person> = { Person: object of type Person }
[00:51:22] <ljharb> DPA: in aggregate over humanity, you could argue it's the same, but that's not a useful context
[00:51:34] <ljharb> worst: yes
[00:52:15] <GreenJello> worst, I don't think so because Person doesn't really have a name
[00:52:16] <Slade> ljharb,  at its heart. the US provides most of the world 3 things.. food, culture and high tech electronics..     #3 will go away which means that labor will need to shift as demand decreases.    at the same time, china's one belt initiative combined with buffetts africa initiatives is going to reduce the world demand on us agriculture, which will also have the effect of reducing the international exchange unit from being the USD  (I'm guessing probably to
[00:52:16] <Slade> something crypto)
[00:52:20] <GreenJello> it's just a reference to a type
[00:52:42] <DPA> ljharb: Traditional code generators do work differently, their responses are pre-specified. But not copilot. It takes code, and generates an intermediate representation. It takes that to generate code. That is the same as a compiler.
[00:52:50] <GreenJello> worst, you could accept a literal string as a generic, and have like HttpResponse<'Person', Person>
[00:52:58] <ljharb> Slade: ok but what's the ultimate consequence of all those shift
[00:52:58] <ljharb> s
[00:53:10] <ljharb> DPA: that is in no way the same as a compiler
[00:53:20] <ljharb> DPA: it is not taking code as input. it's *training* on code.
[00:53:29] <GreenJello> type HttpResponse<K, T> = { [K]: T } or similar
[00:53:36] <ljharb> DPA: especially because it's taking in "the entire code corpus" and not producing a single deterministic output
[00:53:37] <DPA> Where is the difference? Training on code is taking code as input.
[00:53:45] <ljharb> DPA: they're fundamentally different things.
[00:53:56] <DPA> No, they are not.
[00:53:58] <ljharb> DPA: if the output varied based on what you input, then it'd be like a compiler
[00:54:05] <ljharb> DPA: legally and technically, they are
[00:54:22] <ljharb> DPA: otherwise microsoft would have already lost a court case about copilot because they'd be violating licenses
[00:54:35] <Slade> ljharb, if its expected and compensated for? maybe very little other than the USes fade as the ultimate super power..  if its not?  recession, outflow of cash from the US.. which results in some economic changes beyond my level of competency
[00:54:42] <ljharb> DPA: iow if it's a compiler, then they violated almost every kind of software license that isn't copyleft
[00:54:56] <DPA> The output will vary based on the input. It is the same.
[00:54:58] <ljharb> DPA: so either you're right, and microsoft made one of the worst mistakes in their entire history, or you're wrong. which is more likely?
[00:55:17] <ljharb> Slade: and what consequences come from that recession and cash outflow
[00:55:24] <ljharb> Slade: like why do we as citizens give a shit
[00:55:36] <Slade> ljharb, your buying power is reduced
[00:55:39] <DPA> That they got better lawyers, and more cooporative judges now.
[00:55:55] <DPA> cooporative = cooporation frendly.
[00:55:58] <ljharb> Slade: only for foreign-sourced products
[00:56:15] <ljharb> Slade: because the cost of making in-country goods would go down also, modulo foreign parts

[04:23:03] <celphi> i have a site (lots of sites) that will <script src="my_main_site"></script> which will insert javascript into those several sites. the js adds a html document which has the ability to send an ajax call back to the main_site. im trying to insert a unique code for each site's JS
[04:23:42] <celphi> the html document is basically just a form
[04:24:18] <celphi> the smaller sites basically just have to add `<div id="js_handle"></div> where the js is attached to
[04:24:50] <z1haze> so this is the method i came up with that will time a string such as "1d3h5m" and return a date that is that long ago.. see any gaping holes? I've been testing and i _think_ its right https://bpa.st/YZPQ

[04:29:53] <celphi> it's sorta what google maps does
[04:30:05] <wroathe> celphi: Yeah, if that JS executes on their page then you have access to document.location.origin, which is the domain name, port, and protocol for the site
[04:30:36] <GreenJello> celphi, if you need to know who's making the request, you need authentication, and if it's made from the browser then the user can get the credentials and send requests themselves
[04:30:40] <wroathe> document.location.origin => "https://www.google.com", for example
[04:31:06] <celphi> yeah but then they could simply edit their own and put someone elses who is valid
[04:31:53] *** Quits: matsaman (~matsaman@user/matsaman) (Quit: leaving)
[04:32:18] <celphi> it's like this-- these sites need to have their forms updated at anytime so i went with the js route appending to their page. but i need to know when a customer submits their forms and which site it was executed on
[04:32:30] <GreenJello> google maps is mostly concerned with attributing requests for billing purposes, and they probably deal with abuse with rate limits
[04:32:45] <celphi> w/o someone else simply looking at js variables and spoofing it
[04:33:32] <celphi> if i returned back to server the document.location.origin they could simply debug the ajax and put a valid one in
[04:33:38] <wroathe> Ah, if you need to know information about a customer you'll need them to be authenticated, as GreenJello said
[04:34:15] <wroathe> celphi: They'll be able to tweak the request anyway. All they have to do is look at the network tab, grab the request as curl, and tweak whatever they want about it
[04:34:21] <GreenJello> celphi, you would have this same problem even if there was only one site involved
[04:35:07] <celphi> [ sites] [sites] [sites]    -   [master site with api]  the sites request from master site the js to add the forms to their pages. but now i need to know which [site] had their customer submit the forms.

[04:35:29] <celphi> yeah
[04:36:14] <celphi> i just hoped there was a way to get the ip of the site requesting the original js

[05:14:35] <z1haze> ok, cool so i have a couple questions about how to achieve something then. If i know the key of a particular element in a Map, how can I walk backwards from that point, and check previous elements for a certain criteria, and after finding the first one that doesnt match the criteria, trim off the rest of the elements from that point
[05:15:31] <z1haze> the concept of this is that I have api query restrictions, so i query in chunks of 100, and concatenate a massive collection, and upon each query result, i check the last entry returned to see if it meets my criteria. once it meets my criteria, i know that this is the last chunk of need to fetch. however there might be elements in this last chunk that dont need to be ther, so i need to remove those too.
[05:15:58] <z1haze> so i essentially only need to check 1 out of every 100, instead of every single element, until i get to the group that contains the criteria
[05:18:00] <z1haze> i guess i could also just start iterating backwards and deleting elements as i go? isthat possible
[05:18:04] <wroathe> z1haze: Map doesn't support that. Iterators only go forward.
[05:18:09] <z1haze> fudge
[05:18:41] <z1haze> ok, so is it possible to start an iterator at a specific point?

[05:19:56] <wroathe> z1haze: Are these items coming back sorted?
[05:20:43] <z1haze> they do come back sorted, but now that you mention it, im just concatenating the maps together, so i actually dont know if what im doing keeps them sorted, because they are returned with the most recent first
[05:20:45] <wroathe> z1haze: Also, if they're only chunks of 100 I'd just use an array

[05:22:30] <z1haze> so basically if the last item returned is before a after date i specify, i know this group is finished
[05:22:45] <z1haze> but some of those 100 elements might still be before the "after date" i specify. if that makes sense?
[05:22:52] <celphi> but you would always traverse left
[05:23:03] <celphi> im assuming the keys are numerical
[05:23:08] <z1haze> they are

[05:23:48] <wroathe> z1haze: If they're sorted you can just test the last item to determine if you need to search the chunk or not
[05:24:04] <wroathe> z1haze: if the last item is smaller than your target date, you just pass
[05:24:23] <celphi> true that
[05:24:27] <wroathe> z1haze: once the last item is bigger, you know you've found your final chunk, and then you just binary search to strip off the rest
[05:24:42] <z1haze> there's gaps

[05:31:37] <wroathe> I'd probably just do a .forEach on the chunk Map

[06:39:19] <z1haze> thats how i would think of whiteboarding too.. so i guess they have a hybrid
[06:39:27] <falafel> if you know the algortithm needs to lowercase a string, and you dont remember if it's `lower()` or `toLowerCase()`, it doesn't matter, write down what you want

[06:40:19] <z1haze> youll do good man but you have to study

[06:43:56] <celphi> it just counts them?

[06:44:41] <z1haze> yes
[06:44:57] <celphi> can i JSON.stringfy it and regex it?
[06:45:02] <z1haze> so see on mine, like the child object, could have a children array
[06:45:05] <z1haze> of other elements, etc
[06:45:19] <wroathe> z1haze: So they explicitly say "use recursion" in the question?
[06:45:20] <z1haze> haha, maybe
[06:45:35] <z1haze> they explicitly say there can be infinitely levels deep of elements
[06:45:41] <wroathe> z1haze: Yup. Mine handles that.
[06:45:45] <wroathe> z1haze: Without recursion
[06:45:54] <z1haze> then i think yours is good

[07:05:53] <celphi> that doesnt work
[07:06:02] <wroathe> celphi: How do you figure?
[07:06:07] <celphi> the prototype could have that property
[07:06:49] <wroathe> celphi: I suppose that's a negotiation with the interviewer, but I would assume that they're talking about just a plain object literal
[07:07:02] <wroathe> celphi: In which case the prototype will not have .children
[07:07:12] <celphi> ya- the object could somewhere else in code
[07:07:27] <celphi> so always best to use hasOwnProperty just in case
[07:07:55] <wroathe> celphi: I'm personally not inclined to assume extraneous prototypes. It really depends on the context and the invariants you expect to hold.
[07:08:32] <wroathe> celphi: For example, if you're just dealing with data you get off of JSON.parse'ing a fetch response, you'll be dealing with plain objects
[07:08:59] <celphi> yeah but im saying object prototype could have it
[07:09:12] <wroathe> celphi: If it's a plain object it won't
[07:09:18] <wroathe> celphi: That's what I mean by "invariants"

[07:22:10] <wroathe> Here's maybe a bad example: https://github.com/JustinChristensen/react-sample-app/blob/master/src/reducers/messages.js#L6. I'm assuming that the invariant holds that state will be a non-nullish. I've taken other measures within this program to ensure that that invariant holds.

[07:22:41] <wroathe> foureyes: So it would be a pointless waste of code for me to assert that state is non-nullish here, because I'm setting myself up to make assumptions
[07:22:45] <foureyes> my thinking is that what celphi did demonstrates good sense, but routinely implementing type checking in a dynamic language seems to go against the paradigm
[07:23:53] <wroathe> foureyes: If I were to write a simple helper function to process return data from AJAX responses, I would assume that the invariant holds that that data will just be plain old javascript objects.

[07:59:17] <gehn> ljharb makes the pure maths people cry
[07:59:29] <celphi> but if you're doing something that requires millions of computations it saves a ton on time

[08:00:22] <gehn> I recall some pure maths guy who boasted that his stuff was so abstract that it would never be any practical use

[08:00:46] <systemfault> For who though...
[08:00:47] <wroathe> gehn: We call those "category theorists", and despite all of their effort we've found a use for their theory.
[08:01:27] <gehn> at some point in history all maths were pure maths
[08:01:48] <wroathe> I reckon if you go far enough back in history all maths was applied maths
[08:02:16] <wroathe> Accounting for goods and services rendered and such
[08:02:36] <gehn> maybe
[08:02:54] <gehn> I think "that's a big cow. how big is it? I dunno, but it's big, I'll take it" was good enough for most people for a very long time
[08:03:08] <wroathe> gehn: I'll trade you my 2 raccoon pelts for your 3 pumpkins
[08:03:36] <wroathe> gehn: Sure, but they didn't move on to the pure theory of cow sizing before they got to accounting
[08:04:15] <gehn> but accounting required a bunch of abstract "pure" stuff before it was viable
[08:04:20] <gehn> like the concept of zero, or negative numbers
[08:04:29] <celphi> when someone uploaded a list of phone numbers we had to do a search on each one of them first on the LRN then LErG database to get gps/carrier info/ect.. people would upload millions of numbers and there's a part of a phone number that is called the bllock and certain blocks were owned to certain carriers so you wouldnt have to do the full computation if you've ran it before. So the point of using memoziation in a real application saved tons of time
[08:04:43] <wroathe> gehn: You mean like looking at your fingers, and then looking at the mark on the wall you just made, and putting two and two together? :P
[08:04:55] <gehn> no, I mean like zero
[08:05:05] <gehn> which was something that wasn't obvious to people

[08:06:01] <ljharb> celphi: memoization, yes. not fibonacci or factorials.
[08:06:03] <gehn> you have one things? two things? ok that's something worthy of thinking about
[08:06:08] <gehn> you don't have any things? go away
[08:06:26] <systemfault> And let's be honest... fibonacci is not a good use-case for memoization.

[08:07:47] <wroathe> gehn: 'How many rocks does Zog have?" "2 fingers of rocks"

[08:09:12] <ljharb> obviously it's a concept

[08:10:23] <ljharb> gehn: but even a crow is capable of that kind of abstract reasoning

[08:11:02] <ljharb> it's not unique to humans, so it probably was also present in early hominids

If this is set I want to add the image to the main menu bar of icons. I have been trying, but I found out that in setup I can't access the textarea element (I use a selector) and in init_instance_callback I might not be able to add or replace a string in the menu bar configuration. How can I do this?

[20:23:59] <ljharb> theskillwithin: nah that distracts from the issue
[20:24:05] <ljharb> tldr is that tsc is bad for transpiling.
[20:24:16] <systemfault> I understand, and it makes complete sense in frontend-oriented scenarios where you have to support multiple platforms. I can't really justify using babel for TS in backend scenarios though
[20:24:19] <ljharb> whether TS itself is good or bad is a hugely different debate
[20:24:31] <ljharb> systemfault: it's literally the same reasoning tho
[20:24:42] <ljharb> systemfault: and backend is where you're actually way more likely to use some of those stranger language features

[20:28:39] <theskillwithin> well i suppose u mean the data u get back can be null not the query or mutation itself
[20:29:57] <theskillwithin> graphql has gotten a loooooot easier
[20:32:09] <theskillwithin> (im just ranting now btw cuz i like graphql)
[20:32:10] <wroathe> I've done plenty of typed programming in my time, but haven't used TS extensively yet. My current perspective is that it's pretty much vital at the boundaries between applications and libraries and libraries and other libraries, but internally it's a waste of time
[20:33:08] <wroathe> One of the biggest pain points with vanilla JS is change management for libraries. You upgrade something that should be exercising due diligence with semver, and find that they made a breaking interface change, or that they were following semver, but you missed the note in the changelog about the breaking change that was made
[20:33:21] <wroathe> And you then get to find out about either case by _running_ that part of your program in question
[20:33:28] <wroathe> Not great. Typescript saves you from that pain.
[20:33:46] <Slade> its interesting. currently i can do import '@/foo' to get the root of the project. but when i add typescript support that goes away
[20:34:11] <systemfault> No?
[20:34:15] <systemfault> @ has no meaning
[20:34:39] <systemfault> Maybe it's webpack that is configured to recognize it?
[20:34:44] <theskillwithin> is that like a webpack alias he set?
[20:34:50] <Slade> thats what i'm guessing
[20:35:01] <systemfault> If that's that case, then you also need to modify your tsconfig and add the "paths"
[20:35:19] <Slade> which makes me think i need to do what ljharb said and make it use webpack to compile
[20:35:24] <Slade> well babel
[20:35:40] <theskillwithin> or jsconfig.json https://github.com/theskillwithin/theskillwithin-boilerplate/blob/master/jsconfig.json

[20:39:35] <ljharb> Slade: you shouldn't do that kind of aliasing
[20:39:44] <ljharb> Slade: the `../` is a *good* indicator of when things need to be extracted to separate packages
[20:42:50] <wroathe> Linkandzelda: Not a standard way. Best case scenario would be to remove the extraneous image elements from the DOM, and let the browser figure out what it should do with the pending requests.
[20:44:09] <Slade> ljharb, well, i'm more concerned the behavior changes than anything else
[20:46:09] <Slade> oddly there is a 'paths': [ "@/*": [ "src/*"]]   added automatically to the tsconfig.json file
[20:48:26] <Linkandzelda> wroathe: it seems even if i destroy the img elements with jquery .remove() the pending requests still continue, which delays loading the data for the next page
[20:49:22] <wroathe> Linkandzelda: I've heard rumors that setting src to "" will abort the requests in some browsers, but it's not standard behavior

[20:51:18] <ljharb> Linkandzelda: wouldn't you want them to continue so they can populate the cache?
