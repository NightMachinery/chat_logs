[04:46:16] <s-liao> Zipheir how is the thing going with what we were talking about about 'open-output-string'?
[04:46:49] <s-liao> Is there something I can do for that?
[04:47:19] *** Joins: tooDumbToFleng (~alexshend@HSI-KBW-078-043-040-001.hsi4.kabel-badenwuerttemberg.de)
[04:51:19] <Zipheir> s-liao: I don't currently think we should bother changing it.  I can't see any reason to do it, and it makes the CHICKEN version unnecessarily more different from the SRFI sample implementation.
[04:51:45] <Zipheir> Also, if CHICKEN gets real bytevector ports at some point, we want to use those.
[04:53:19] <Zipheir> srfi-207 has to use the r7rs egg, regardless; we need the bytevector stuff.
[05:05:28] <s-liao> Yeah. SRFI is SRFI, like in srfi-207, if its code portable. there is an other story.
[05:06:32] <s-liao> But what we are talking about , SRFI sample implementation,mostly like say it is portable code.
[05:07:27] <Zipheir> Oh, I'm willing to make non-portable changes to the egg.  I just don't see a compelling reason in this case.
[05:09:03] <Zipheir> get-output-bytevector is (string->utf8 (get-output-string port)) in the r7rs egg.  It wouldn't be any more efficient to use that directly in srfi-207.
[05:09:36] <Zipheir> But maybe I'm missing the point?
[05:10:07] <s-liao> That is one side.
[05:11:09] <s-liao> That is part of what I am saying, the implementation of open-input-bytevector, still need the ##sys#setslot, which is not portable.
[05:15:11] <s-liao> What I mean is that we can do coding as much as we can for its portable, for demonstrate the concept. not necessary.
[05:18:42] <s-liao> But as you said that 'get-output-bytevector is (string->utf8 (get-output-string port))' make the inefficient to use directly in srfi-207. that is a reason to modify it.
[05:20:00] <Zipheir> There's no other way that I know.  We either use get-output-bytevector from r7rs or copy it into srfi-207.
[05:20:25] <Zipheir> So it's the same implementation either way.
[05:20:26] *** Quits: Soni (~quassel@autistic.space) (Quit: http://quassel-irc.org - Chat comfortably. Anywhere.)
[05:21:01] <s-liao> Basically that idea is that portable code for SRFIs, the demonstrate the concept in SRFIs, they are different thing, I guess they should follow the different process.
[05:21:20] *** Joins: Soni (~quassel@autistic.space)
[05:21:43] <Zipheir> I'm saying there's no reason to change the portable code because there's no better non-portable way to do it.
[05:22:02] <Zipheir> Unless Someone™ wants to rewrite all the stuff that uses bytevector ports.
[05:22:54] <Zipheir> (And I don't mean to use string ports instead; we've seen that they are the same thing in CHICKEN.  I mean *totally rewrite* it.)
[05:24:24] <s-liao> Yes, I got your point.
[05:24:33] <Zipheir> s-liao: I haven't seen a more efficient CHICKEN-specific way to do it.  That's it.
[05:26:31] <s-liao> Thanks
[05:28:20] <Zipheir> s-liao: To be clear: I appreciate your feedback!  Please let me know if you have other ideas for improving the egg.

[06:01:22] <s-liao> Until now, I have not found out yet.
[06:05:23] <s-liao> What about reduce the dependence like srfi-160. As we have the r7rs-small for this egg dependence for u8 things. Then dependence on srfi-160  sound like no meaning. I have not check it yet.

[13:44:14] <s-liao> Zipheir One more time, I think that in term of SRFI-207, open-output-string and get-output-string from (chicken base) , there is not any different to open-output-bytevector and get-output-bytevector. they are exchangeable functionality.  But there are two ways to represent this exchangeable, one is in current code we have, like (import (only
[13:44:15] <s-liao> chicken.base get-output-string open-output-string))  then (define (open-output-bytevector) (open-output-string))

[13:47:42] <s-liao> Other way is that in  (rename
[13:47:42] <s-liao>            (only (chicken base)
[13:47:43] <s-liao>                 open-output-string )
[13:47:43] <s-liao>            ( open-output-string open-output-bytevector)
[13:49:50] <s-liao> From the standard point view. we should have an standard way to represent the exchangeable.
[13:49:59] <s-liao> mangol
[13:55:57] <s-liao> Like we need a clear line between R7RS-small portable code  and CHICKEN-specific code. when the function is exchangeable. when does not. And have certain grammar or form (tools) to support in manageable way.

[19:47:05] <Zipheir> That doesn't make sense to me.  Does anyone else understand what s-liao is trying to tell me about string ports?
[20:19:50] <Bunny351> is their implementation identical to SRFI-207 bytevector ports?
[20:35:03] <Zipheir> The "bytevector ports" are from the r7rs egg and are just a very thin layer on string ports.
[20:36:31] <Zipheir> srfi-207 uses them to accumulate bytestrings written in the #u8"..." notation.
