[00:51:33] <Sauvin> Android itself is often cited as "spyware".

[05:23:38] <ayecee> TheDcoder: okay, what problem would _that_ solve
[05:23:45] <[[R]]> TheDcoder: huh?
[05:23:59] <TheDcoder> ayecee: so that apache can finally access the files without ownership issues :P
[05:24:09] <[[R]]> docker works with standad permissions just fine...
[05:24:38] <ayecee> so apache can modify /etc/hosts?
[05:24:45] <TheDcoder> [[R]]: Docker just uses whatever owner/permissions are present in the host, and I don't want to change the permissions in the host itself
[05:24:46] <Bhavuk> yes you can have user owned /foo & user1 owned /foo/bar

[05:26:24] <BigfootImpostor> Pffft, I actually eat raw onions as a snack commonly, peeling is amateur xD
[05:26:29] <TheDcoder> [[R]]: that the host's permissions are copied over when you mount them inside a container

[05:28:02] <Sabinno> `dnf check-upgrade` does not accomplish my stated goal, I'll add
[05:28:08] <ayecee> Sabinno: that part seems reasonable. how does fault handling work there? like if e.g. base.sack.query() had a missing file, does it throw an error and a stack trace?

[06:16:20] <ayecee> it's going to take a bit to decode this line of questioning
[06:16:26] <Psi-Jack> You change ownership/permisions on the host, not the container.
[06:16:42] <TheDcoder> well that's the problem, the host needs to have different permissions
[06:16:54] <TheDcoder> the host is locked down
[06:16:57] <Psi-Jack> Then you use ACLs.

[06:17:24] <Psi-Jack> But, why are permission differences a thing here at all? This is definitely going to be a problem. 🙂
[06:17:37] <Psi-Jack> Docker literally doesn't care about ACLs, it's the host that cares.
[06:17:48] <TheDcoder> the program which needs those files runs as a different user
[06:17:56] <ayecee> the host doesn't care either, it's the user that cares!

[07:16:27] <coldenbrewed> I just installed wetty with yarn command
[07:16:37] <coldenbrewed> But the bash shell said the command wetty is not recognized
[07:16:39] <Gustavo6046> moistty when
[07:16:45] <coldenbrewed> is there a special way to run apps installed with yarn?
[07:16:46] <[[R]]> coldenbrewed: is the directory its installed in in your PATH?
[07:16:51] <ayecee> oh like "i think" means something different?
[07:16:51] <FloridaMan> detached tmux or screen processes still have stdout/stderr and you just don't see them until you're attached
[07:17:07] <Gustavo6046> coldenbrewed: yarn installs global packages, and by extension their exposed 'bin' entrypoints, into its own folder, separate from even npm's

[18:09:59] <Psi-Jack> Again, elistist community, That generally is pretty toxic.
[18:10:00] <hexnewbie> Keyboard-driven PDF annotation could be really funny, especially on a scanned PDF where you're trying to annotate text in a PDF where ‘Продукт’ has been automatically OCRed to ‘IIposyK-r’ (currently working with one), *or* the text does not match the position on the page for some reason

[18:12:38] <hodapp> why I left Arch after ~5-6 years of using it is: the community being elitist as hell, upgrades breaking things every 3-4 months badly enough that it required some kind of manual fix to make my machine usable, and just enough things being non-standard that packages I needed could not work

As they freeze new software quite some months before the new release, you will have rather "old" software. But you have the stable backports, and you could also run either debian-testing or debian-sid
[18:13:52] <hodapp> felco: I'd expect them to be more and more prevalent

[19:04:25] <svarq> Hi, I have my laptop to dual boot Windows and OpenSUSE tumbleweed using grub2. On restart, the grub2 menu would show to switch between different kernel versions and my Windows 10 OS. Recently I selected windows as a 1-time OS default using <<grub2-reboot 2>>, which should skip the grub2 menu on reboot and boot straight into Windows. It worked, but now the grub2 menu doesn't show up on boot and I can't select SUSE to be booted. grub2 does output 2 lines on
[19:04:25] <svarq> reboot before Windows is automatically booted, one of which says to press "t" to bring up the menu. I've tried "t", "Shift" and "Esc" during this time (less than a second window), but nothing happens and Windows proceeds to automatically boot
[19:04:25] <svarq> . Sadly my BIOS only has options to select the default boot loader, and doesn't have functionality to select an OS to boot
[19:04:27] <esselfe> actually mine is full US, but it was just to expose the key location
[19:04:28] <svarq> ... Would anybody happen to know how to modify the grub configuration on Windows? It's located on a btrfs partition used by OpenSUSE. Otherwise, would you have any more tips for diagnosing or fixing the issue?
[19:04:31] <svarq>  thanks in advance :)

I have been setting up a `Nextcloud` infrastructure for myself and my puppies , and I quite like it tbh , but also I see it like too much complexity in regards of all the `php` stuff going on and the apache server and so on. By using `nextcloud` I have stumbled upon `rclone` which is amazing , and I was thinking to maybe start syncing with this utility (which is also

[22:48:49] <hexnewbie> I don't think you can have a bitmap on a RAID-0, so it won't touch the metadata (disclaimer: never used RAID-0 for anything)
[22:48:54] <c705> hexnewbie: it wouldn't wear faster, that's wrong. it will wear two disks at the same rate, instead of one. in effect, you're using an extra disk for increased perfoemance

[23:42:49] <Psi-Jack> I don't much like doing this fix in json, but I can appreciate it just working, and not causing kernel updates and other updates to just break pulse because a slight variation in the device name.
