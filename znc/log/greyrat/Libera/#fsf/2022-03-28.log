[00:44:25] <Exa> Hi, I have a question about the "7. Additional Terms." section of the GPL.  There is software in GPL where the maintainer supplemented terms to the license (which meet criteria given in that section), but without getting prior permissions from all contributors, including for a dependency used that is (still) released under GPL.  IANAL but my reading of the GPL prevents this.  Any thoughts?  (I'm not looking for real legal advice.)  Thanks.

[05:40:13] <DiffieHellman> BSD's are a collection of OS's. Hyperbola maybe might be moving to GNU/aBSDkernel
[05:41:55] <isf> so BSD is alike GNU?
[05:42:02] <isf> but have nonfree software?
[05:42:30] <isf> and the same name of the kernel of BSD are BSD too?

[05:43:01] <catt[m]> AwesomeAdam54321: Not always, but for all i know of yes
[05:43:04] <isf> so, whats the name of the BSD kernel?
[05:43:05] <catt[m]> Not a rule though
[05:43:12] <catt[m]> isf: BSD kernel
[05:43:15] <catt[m]> From berkeley
[05:43:24] <DiffieHellman> Most BSD's are all free software (but some BSD's include nonfree software), but they're under a pushover license, so proprietary software developers just take it and make proprietary software.
[05:43:25] <AwesomeAdam54321> isf: k*BSD
[05:43:26] <catt[m]> A part of the bsd system
[05:43:33] <isf> "BSD kernel" thats the name?
[05:43:39] <DiffieHellman> The BSD's don't tend to have a particular name for the kernel.
[05:43:51] <catt[m]> The bsd system along with kernel was distributed under bsd license i think
[05:43:52] <AwesomeAdam54321> isf: kFreeBSD, kNetBSD, etc
[05:44:29] <catt[m]> But unlike the linux kernel used in GNU systems, bsd kernels are completely seperately maintained
[05:44:42] <DiffieHellman> Please don'
[05:44:53] <DiffieHellman> t say "Linux kernel", that implies that Linux is more than a kernel.
[05:44:57] <catt[m]> Every big bsd maintains their own kernel fork, and theyve differed for years
[05:45:09] <DiffieHellman> Just say Linux, or if you want to be clear; the kernel, Linux.
[05:45:10] <catt[m]> DiffieHellman: Why not say linux kernel
[05:45:35] <catt[m]> I say it to note that im referring to linux kernel
[05:45:42] <DiffieHellman> catt[m]: Pretty much, for most OS's, the kernel doesn't have a particular name, so the naming for the kernel is usually; <OS name> kernel.
[05:45:42] <AwesomeAdam54321> catt[m]: Because "BSD kernel" implies that BSD has more than a kernel
[05:46:00] <catt[m]> AwesomeAdam54321: Bsd has full base system with it
[05:46:05] <catt[m]> Its like unix when that was popular
[05:46:19] <catt[m]> The userland and kernel named same thing
[05:46:20] <tpefreedom> catt[m], DiffieHellman, linux, as more than a kernel would simply logically include anything based on linux as a kernel,
[05:46:21] <qrpnxz> Atr[m], i like fedora and rhel
[05:46:26] <AwesomeAdam54321> catt[m]: It makes sense for BSD, but saying "Linux kernel" can be misleading

[05:48:04] <tpefreedom> Any recommendations for ftp server software?
[05:48:05] <qrpnxz> they didn't have to find another one, they just did
[05:48:16] <qrpnxz> if linux hadn't come, they just keep working on the hurd
[05:48:17] <DiffieHellman> Hurd used the kernel, Mach to save developement time, but sadly developing on a microkernel isn't trivial.
[05:48:20] <catt[m]> qrpnxz: Well they wanted the system to be done faster
[05:48:30] <catt[m]> So they said sure lets use linux
[05:48:37] <qrpnxz> after linus freed it yeah
[05:48:49] <DiffieHellman> In 1992, Linux was made free software, and so GNU was combined with the kernel, Linux to make a very powerful OS.
[05:49:09] <qrpnxz> powerful how
[05:49:16] <catt[m]> Hurd had some concept of how it would work that made it hard to develop afaik
[05:49:29] <catt[m]> Thats just what i heard
[05:49:35] <AwesomeAdam54321> qrpnxz: As fully free software, it gave all of its users control over their own computing
[05:49:38] <catt[m]> Its still in early stages today

[05:49:51] <qrpnxz> yeah stallman said in documentary revolution os that they chose an architecture that was difficult to debug and develop

[05:50:27] <qrpnxz> what is that
[05:50:32] <DiffieHellman> Not even that, Linus seems to hate freedom to a level that cuts into the entineering.

[05:50:51] <qrpnxz> catt[m], what does difficult mean? means not easy

[05:50:54] <catt[m]> Wdym
[05:50:58] <AwesomeAdam54321> the HURD provides all the functionality that Mach lacks
[05:51:05] <tpefreedom> DiffieHellman, how does it seem to hate freedom?
[05:51:15] <catt[m]> qrpnxz: Yes
[05:51:16] <DiffieHellman> Linus doesn't care to actually enforce his copyright, thus allowing proprietary software to use Linux,
[05:51:27] <catt[m]> Difficult to make
[05:51:35] <catt[m]> But isnt architecture x86_64?
[05:52:02] <qrpnxz> linux has thousands of authors, linus is not required to enforce gpl on it. Linux gpl gets enforced plenty
[05:52:04] <catt[m]> How is that going to change if youre just making a program
[05:52:12] <tpefreedom> but is that really hating freedom or just apathy?
[05:52:25] <qrpnxz> linus is open source guy
[05:52:31] <DiffieHellman> tpefreedom: It's apathy. He complains about Nvidia, but won't do anything about them.
[05:52:34] <qrpnxz> all about engineering
[05:52:39] <catt[m]> qrpnxz: Yes
[05:52:40] <tpefreedom> What could he do?
[05:52:48] <qrpnxz> do to do what
[05:52:52] <tpefreedom> (Aside from creating a meme)
[05:52:56] <tpefreedom> about nvidia
[05:53:01] <AwesomeAdam54321> tpefreedom: Block inclusion of Nvidia drivers until it's freed
[05:53:15] <catt[m]> Linus probably uses windows and runs his kernel development tests through virtualbox
[05:53:24] <catt[m]> It seems like the linus thing to do
[05:53:27] <DiffieHellman> tpefreedom: Nvidia's shim driver contains a GPL exception that Linux doesn't have, so he could widthdraw his copyright for that, until their driver is released as free software.
[05:53:43] <DiffieHellman> catt[m]: Nah, he at least uses GNU/Linux on hardware.
[05:53:45] <qrpnxz> linus uses fedora
[05:53:54] <catt[m]> qrpnxz: I doubt
[05:53:56] <qrpnxz> and he just boots the kernel, don't think he uses vm
[05:54:03] <qrpnxz> catt[m], ok you can doubt it but it's fact
[05:54:07] <tpefreedom> fedora > ubuntu
[05:54:17] <qrpnxz> he has used it over a decade now i think
[05:54:18] <qrpnxz> before that idk
[05:54:22] <qrpnxz> maybe slackware or smth
[05:54:33] <catt[m]> I saw some interview about linus where they ask him questions and he had to awkwardly dodge every single one
[05:54:35] <qrpnxz> he wrote linux specifically for his own use
[05:54:47] <catt[m]> Because the interviewer people think he made the whole GNU/Linux OS
[05:54:58] <catt[m]> he doesnt even correct them, he just avoids it
[05:55:13] <qrpnxz> ok?
[05:55:19] <DiffieHellman> Yes, he didn't like MINIX, so he decided to start writing his own OS - but he ended up starting with the kernel and just integrating it with GNU.
[05:55:49] <qrpnxz> he didn't end up starting with the kernel, i believe that was his express goal, the kernel
[05:55:53] <qrpnxz> minix is also a kernel no?
[05:55:57] <catt[m]> DiffieHellman: Wasnt the story that he couldnt afford it
[05:56:01] <DiffieHellman> MINIX is an OS plus a kernel.
[05:56:15] <catt[m]> Idk
[05:56:22] <DiffieHellman> Linus at the start actively mentioned that Linux was only a kernel and that it needs to be combined with an OS to work, but now he simply avoids mentioning it, as he gets paid by globhomo not to do so.
[05:56:52] <DiffieHellman> qrpnxz: Linus announed at the start that his goal was to write an OS, but not as big or professional as GNU.
[05:57:22] <DiffieHellman> He started with the kernel though, but he didn't have to write the OS thanks to GNU.
[05:57:28] <catt[m]> The Linux Foundation gets 100M+ a year, FSF gets ~1.3M
[05:57:44] <catt[m]> Its sad how things ended up
[05:57:58] <qrpnxz> you can call the kernel an OS, or the kernel plus userspace distribution an OS, you cannot call userspace alone an OS
[05:58:16] <DiffieHellman> Yes, the Linux foundation is all about adding features usable to globhomo and that's it.
[05:58:39] <catt[m]> qrpnxz: Other OSes do this though
[05:58:42] <DiffieHellman> qrpnxz: You can't call the kernel an OS, as an operating system is a system of software that allows you to operate your computer, which a kernel on its own does not do.

[05:59:30] <catt[m]> qrpnxz: Wikipedia definition
[05:59:32] <qrpnxz> depending on the context, you can view the whole aggregation as "the OS", but most minimally, the OS is just the kernel
[05:59:42] <DiffieHellman> Yes, as people know what windows mean and saying "microsoft windows Net technology <version> " isn't required.
[05:59:43] <tpefreedom> globhomo? wdym? big tech?
[05:59:52] <DiffieHellman> Yes.
[06:00:19] <tpefreedom> but why call it globhomo?
[06:00:20] <DiffieHellman> Of wait, catt[m] was actually affirming my point
[06:00:24] <qrpnxz> what is not fits by any definition is userspace alone as the OS, that is not an OS. The defining element of an OS is management of resources
[06:00:58] <catt[m]> DiffieHellman: I dont like mentioning more than one part of the system when im bringing it up
[06:01:43] <catt[m]> Having to refer to the system as GNU/Linux gets annoying
[06:01:56] <catt[m]> Not sure why people dont just call it the GNU system
[06:03:26] <catt[m]> Linux is a useful part of the system, but its just a kernel. For something like alpine busybox/linux, just call it busybox
[06:03:29] <qrpnxz> calling it GNU is nice if you want to point people to that effort, but it's not super appropriate because almost all the packages in a distro or not GNU projects, sometimes nto at all
[06:04:24] <catt[m]> qrpnxz: Well, at least gnu is not a singled out program unlike linux
[06:04:44] <catt[m]> Linux is just one of the important components that was selected to be a part of the name
[06:04:59] <catt[m]> GNU usually makes up a lot of the components
[06:05:04] <qrpnxz> i think calling an official gnu project distribution of gnu programs plus linux GNU/Linux makes sense, but say Fedora Linux doesn't make that much sense to call GNU. It's not affiliated with GNU at all, it only incidentally has some GNU packages. Just about all of which are have alternatives
[06:05:21] <catt[m]> And for these not at all cases, you can replace it with whatever you're using
[06:05:29] <catt[m]> ex. Busybox
[06:05:38] <catt[m]> Which is the main alternative to gnu utils
[06:05:50] <DiffieHellman> Just GNU is a suitable name, but that isn't clear if you mean GNU/Linux or GNU/Hurd.

[06:06:38] <catt[m]> DiffieHellman: Yes, at least until, if ever, many distributions make hurd kernel variations
[06:07:14] <qrpnxz> I'd call that Fedora Hurd maybe, or just Fedora with Hurd
[06:07:22] *** Joins: fling (~fling@user/fling)
[06:07:30] <catt[m]> Fedora Hurd edition?
[06:07:48] <qrpnxz> I don't call my system Fedora GNOME edition when i have gnome installed so
[06:08:08] <catt[m]> qrpnxz: No need to
[06:08:10] <DiffieHellman> Sure, but it woudln't be incorrect to do so.
[06:08:39] <catt[m]> Unless it matters to the context of what youre doing, people dont mention specific programs being used on their systems
[06:10:04] <catt[m]> Naming a complete system usually does end up poorly when all your components are from different groups of people
[06:10:38] <qrpnxz> the system that makes the most sense to call GNU is Guix, but guix is just guix so again GNU sort of superfluous. To let people know about GNU, you should just bring up GNU itself.
[06:13:02] <qrpnxz> i think most distros also package like all the apache things, but nobody ever says "Apache distribution". You say maybe, hey i got all the apache software packaged

[07:18:26] <isf> jacobk, that is good too
[07:18:33] <hongkongliberato> yes, but we have to resist use of tiktok, github,,etc

[22:34:05] <qrpnxz> oh, why you should trust DDG? idk lol
[22:34:23] <qrpnxz> i don't even have js enabled on ddg or google, or any search
[22:35:23] <kompowiec2> well, for some reason people trust a VPN for example

[22:36:19] <qrpnxz> vpn hides me from ISP
[22:36:26] <qrpnxz> what makes my browsing secure is TLS
[22:36:54] <qrpnxz> it also hides my IP from IRC, XMPP, torrent etc
[22:38:07] <qrpnxz> therefore no i won't stop using vpn
[22:38:28] <zemzem> ddg is losing its privacy-centered grasp 
[22:38:40] <zemzem> they said they wont show "disinformation" in their search results

[22:43:02] <qrpnxz> DDG is probably already biased because it doesn't do its own crawling anyway. It'd be nice to get more transparency on how exactly they rank down. If they down rank individual articles, or whole publications, or whole countries, for example.
[22:44:13] <zemzem> But they openly said last month that they will be filtering "disinformation"
[22:44:24] <qrpnxz> downranking i believe

[23:14:55] <qrpnxz> oh i see what it's doing. So when you do it generates CSS with resources to a unique path, your browser then fetches from that unique path based on it's capability or what it already has installed and so on. Then to track you across pages it can make the links on the page use that same dynamically generated path, or just recalculate the fingerprint.
[23:16:20] <qrpnxz> this is a fingerprint i got on the tor browser b15acf0466e7b2da06cfea09b1ab2cda, what do you get on tor?

[23:24:39] <qrpnxz> well i'd say this is pretty serious fingering, not sure what we can do about it
[23:25:54] <jacobk> Well Tor Browser could update to make fingerprints more similar, depending on what's different
[23:28:18] <jacobk> For example it could always ask for the same color bitness (assuming that's something that's different) and then downscale or upscale depending on the monitor.
