[00:21:16] <deltasquared> so this isn't entirely ffmpeg related, but... I'm currently mucking around with ffmpeg to apply EQ of sorts to some instrument samples. so far I was able to adapt the settings from a previous "live" plugin I was using which was great. though now I find myself staring at the settings for the various {low,high}pass/cut filters in ffmpeg's docs and I realise I don't have any good way to visualise the
[00:21:22] <deltasquared> response curves they would produce.
[00:21:44] <deltasquared> (heck, I'm not even sure what specific type of filter implementation is being used internally)
[00:22:42] <deltasquared> so like... would there be any way I could measure or show that. either directly or empirically by analysis I guess. (the latter I think I could fudge in audacity, but that would be a bit clumsy and slow to tweak.)

[03:04:33] <SpeakerToMeat__> Stupid question, transcoding h264 to h264 (both lossy) is deterministic, no?
[03:05:53] <SpeakerToMeat__> Meaning, using the same binary for ffmpeg, and the same source, encoding twice should produce the same binary output?
[03:06:29] <c_14> depends on your encoder, x264 I believe encodes deterministically (for the same input and the same settings)

[15:14:57] <mc8821> Hello, I have a question about segments with ffmpeg. I'm currently trying to generate segments dyamically (with -ss -t, hls segments), which works perfectly, but there is always an audio stutter, which seems to be audio priming (aac). Is there a solution to this problem, like timing the segment so it has the perfect audio length, etc.?
[15:16:48] <JEEB> simplest is if you just encode teh audio in one go instead of trying to split the encoding of audio. alternatively you figure out the encoder's priming samples' length, and feed it enough audio manually to then be able to strip that/those initial packet(s) containing priming samples and whatever you're feeding at the beginning
[15:17:11] <JEEB> of course the latter requires actual API usage so out of the box ffmpeg.c will not do it for you of course
[15:19:29] *** Joins: Volgaar (~volgaar@104.66.13.93.rev.sfr.net)
[15:19:59] <mc8821> Encoding the whole audio works, but then it will not be on demand anymore (it would take too much time). I'm currenctly generating the m3u8 playlist on my own (programmatically) and then let the browser request the segments which are generated on-demand.
[15:20:59] <mc8821> I have also tried to split the video and audio, e.g. video segment = 6 seconds, audio segment = 60 seconds, but then the stream gets out of sync. hls.js (the javascript library I use to play hls streams in the browser) always reports that the audio segments overlap about 37ms
[15:21:37] <mc8821> So, I can try to generate 6s of audio and 6s of video and then try to merge them together?
[15:24:49] <mc8821> For example, this is how I generate the segment currently (through my api/application)

[23:32:26] <JEEB> cpu-used is probably the one I'm most knowledge'able
[23:32:35] <JEEB> which is a number from 0 to 8
[23:32:41] <JEEB> default is 1
[23:35:53] <edgy> JEEB: excellent tried cpu-used 8 and now it finished. Shouldn't the default be something reasonable in comparable to the defaults for x264 and others?

[23:36:51] <JEEB> the good ol' days of 2006 were in a completely different ballpark :)
[23:37:03] <JEEB> also as noted, libaom is pretty much the reference
[23:37:35] <JEEB> I think AOM picked svt-av1 as their "fast" encoder thing, but that's still under work
[23:38:07] <JEEB> the expectations for an encoder should more or less be based on what the format is and how old the encoder is
[23:38:11] <another|> also: in newer version of aom, cpu-used ranges from 0-6
[23:38:21] <JEEB> lol
[23:38:40] <edgy> JEEB: sorry couldn't understand. You mean libaom is an old format and there is something better nowadays?
[23:38:52] <JEEB> no, AV1 is *new*

[23:41:32] <JEEB> anyways, you can't really expect encoders to be as fast with older formats
[23:41:35] <JEEB> for newer formats
[23:41:53] <JEEB> since usually improved results come from additional stuff or more alternatives
[23:41:54] <edgy> JEEB: ah! you mean this is not an ffmpeg issue, it's av1 encoder issue that they chose very slow default, right?
[23:41:56] <Hello71> and of course a mobile cpu will have awful encoding performance
[23:42:28] <JEEB> edgy: libaom is the google reference implementation. there is a reason why the alliance for open media actually now picked a "fast encoder" project as well
[23:42:35] <JEEB> which I think currently is SVT-AV1
[23:42:46] <Hello71> the only thing that i7 is good for in mobile is burst performance and ridiculously expensive "gaming" laptops
[23:42:47] <JEEB> but in general, the newer the format, the slower the encoder
[23:43:10] <JEEB> because in newer formats you get additional capabilities or more alternatives when doing X
[23:43:14] <Hello71> for sustained loads i think it often ends up *slower* than i5

[23:43:33] <JEEB> like in H.264 you had like 8 differnt angles for something, and then in newer formats they added up to 56 or whatever
[23:43:45] <JEEB> so now the encoder gets to pick which is the best from 56 instead of 8
[23:44:05] <JEEB> then H.264 was limited to 16x16 blocks top
[23:44:18] <JEEB> while AV1 for example if I recall correctly has the topology of 64x64 blocks
[23:44:25] <JEEB> which can then be split in various ways
[23:44:35] <JEEB> or was it 128x128 with AV1? :D

[23:45:21] <JEEB> you can of course try to make a fast encoder by limiting yourself to a specific set of things that is the same as with an older format, and that way lose efficiency but maybe be faster
[23:45:36] <JEEB> I think ericsson or so did that with H.264 back in ye olden days
[23:45:43] <JEEB> they just made minimal changes to their MPEG-2 Video encoder
[23:45:48] <JEEB> to make it output valid H.264

[23:47:17] <edgy> JEEB: execuse my ignorance, and I would do my best trying to read about all this jargon you write. But should I understand all this stuff to understand what's wrong if they just put cpu-used 8 by default?
[23:48:47] <edgy> Hello71: say whatever about my CPU, but my question is why this AWFUL CPU works for other formats nicely but not this one. JEEB is trying to explain it but it's way above my knowledge
[23:48:50] <JEEB> it probably skips a lot of stuff, not that I know. so the efficiency can be really crap in order to make it faster. I'm just generally trying to explain that trying to keep to a similar baseline of using functionality in newer formats means that encoders get slower the newer the format. because that baseline of "what in general we should attempt to utilize" gets larger and larger
[23:49:20] <JEEB> like if you need to check 8 things, and figure out which is best - it is going to be faster than checking 56 things
[23:49:50] <Hello71> edgy: as apparently no popular media can ever get right, there are (at least!) *three* factors to consider when encoding media. size, (encoding) speed, and quality
[23:49:55] <JEEB> and this stuff is why projects like x264 are awesome
[23:50:07] <JEEB> since x264 was actually faster than xvid etc in various cases :D
[23:50:18] <JEEB> while giving better performance/using newer format's features
[23:50:19] <Hello71> if you turn up the speed then either the size increases or the quality decreases
[23:51:07] <JEEB> (x264 is the exceptional case of people really Caring and optimizing the begeesus out of something)
[23:51:32] <Hello71> different encoders have different areas of "expertise". it is possible that if you adjust aom to be faster, then it will be both bigger and worse quality than x264. otoh if you adjust x264 to be slower, then it will be bigger and worse quality than aom
[23:52:59] <Hello71> you cannot only look at speed, that's obviously useless. i can make a super fast encoder that turns everything to blank screen. it will be the fastest encoder you ever used, but i doubt you will want to archive your videos using this program
[23:53:11] <edgy> JEEB: yes, this makes sense if e.g 25s video takes a couple of mins, but do you this argument makes sense evenif a 25s videos takes hours?
[23:53:46] <another|> depends on your use case
[23:54:04] <JEEB> so now you got the general case of: newer formats have slower encoders, but then there's the whole "how and for whom a specific encoder project is tweaked for"
[23:54:09] <Hello71> if your 25s video will be downloaded millions of times then maybe it is worth it
[23:54:16] <edgy> JEEB: yes
[23:54:40] <JEEB> libaom is a reference encoder so I wouldn't be surprised if the defaults are just what they are.
[23:54:55] <JEEB> since reference encoders generally are utilized to test out new features in development for formats
[23:55:04] <JEEB> so generally you don't want it to skimp on stuff
[23:55:17] <JEEB> (even if by skimping XYZ % of the work you could still gain 90% of the result)
[23:56:10] <edgy> JEEB: can the SVT-AV1 be used? or it's still a work in progress?
[23:56:44] <JEEB> I think it doesn't always crash at least :D
[23:56:54] <edgy> JEEB: ;)
[23:56:58] <JEEB> it has had one release or so after it got picked as the official "fast" encoder
[23:57:05] <JEEB> I mean, you will have to do your own comparisons whether any encoders give you good enough performance for the speed you require
[23:57:25] <edgy> JEEB: and for the old -b:v 0, shouldn't it be removed from the documentation?
[23:58:00] <JEEB> maybe, I have no idea what the reality actually is. I just know that even with libvpx-vp9 that at some point was tweaked to be unneeded
[23:58:09] <JEEB> (but I might be completely incorrect regarding that too)
