[10:50:59] <NatashaNox[m]> Might be, although I know them for about 4 years now. I simultaneously had internet problems (enormous package loss but otherwise good latency) and multiple gifts on humblebundle I sent to a friend were stolen instantly, so there might be a reasonable possibility. Although one of the later were sent directly from them (humblebundle) to the friend via mail and instantly gone, so I still suspect their end to be the compromised one and
[10:51:00] <NatashaNox[m]> connection problems to be a fluke.
[10:51:00] <NatashaNox[m]> Still, I'm really anxious about all of this.
[10:52:27] <cmbrnt> If you have packet loss on all your devices, bring another one home and test with that. If that is also affected this is not a malware problem.
[10:53:00] <cmbrnt> If the new device works fine, wipe all devices you suspect to be infected. If you take backups and are sensible in how you store data then it shouldn't take that long.
[10:53:30] <NatashaNox[m]> The trojan is supposedly called sth like "vypnet-ex2", but even Google literally knows nothing about it. Is there any other source I could try looking it up?
[10:53:31] <cmbrnt> I would personally not wipe all devices, only the ones I suspect to be affected.
[10:53:48] <cmbrnt> How did your friend discover the trojan on your device?

[11:12:46] <adderall> Wouldn't an IPS be better though?
[11:12:56] <cmbrnt> NatashaNox[m]: Well, hard to tell without any actual details, but things I would check in your situation:
[11:12:59] <adderall> ... Unless you're trying to do some type of honeypot busienss
[11:12:59] <cmbrnt> 1) Is your computer's IP address public or private? If private, does your router have any port forwarding enabled? Turn off UPnP and NAT-PMP on your router for now. If private and no port forwarding is set up, your friend wouldn't be able to scan your computer to find malware on it. In that case your router still might have been infected of course. Upgrade it or change it to some cheap alternative if
[11:13:06] <cmbrnt> you're worried.
[11:13:08] <cmbrnt> 2) If this is your friend and they are being that specific, they should be able to point you to some clear web information about it. Security researchers are very well funded and any actively used malware that is "known on the deep web" is also known by the mainstream security field a short time thereafter. People use the deep web as a scare tactic when in reality its contents doesn't differ much from
[11:13:14] <cmbrnt> the clear web.
[11:13:21] <shibboleth> adderall, "intelligent". yeah, lemme know when it can brush its own teeth
[11:13:31] <adderall> Security researchers are both well-funded and thoroughly confused

[11:54:33] <cmbrnt> TheGibson: Yes, I think I agree. "Security research" is mostly plain IT security work coupled with journalism and blogs in my opinion. But when left to choose who to trust on topics like these, I would recommend to take more from the industry news output than from the fear mongers and the politically motivated.

[15:53:51] <cmbrnt> darsie: If you get a link leading to an IMAP login and try to guess the login using a password you use for other accounts, they could log that and attempt to log into your e-mail with that password... "bernhard" could be the identifier that they match with your actual e-mail address.
[15:54:34] <cmbrnt> A bit convulted compared to sending an https link of course, but maybe more effective in getting people to fall for it.

[20:34:35] <BigBitsAndNAS> Is not most services from vps??
[20:34:48] <skill> xx: what i'm saying is that most vps (at least the ones i use) default to encrypting FS but I also don't see them as completely unable of getting stuff if they wanted to
[20:35:03] <skill> BigBitsAndNAS: people who are worried about passwords/certs to the point they can't trust any provider, yes
[20:35:14] <MadCamel> xx: in tang. Check it out: https://github.com/latchset/clevis . Since we're already mucking with the initrd to provide for key retrieval cryptsetup-reencrypt can be ran via initrd hooks before the root fs is mounted.

[20:39:35] <BigBitsAndNAS> skill Yes it sounds. I have not seen many research results with the topic

[20:40:04] <BigBitsAndNAS> Must ===> most
[20:40:07] <skill> BigBitsAndNAS: it's jsut the reality that vps have physical access
[20:40:10] <xx> in fact, most vps probably already encrypt stuff outside of your container or virtual machine, to help with easy disk disposal
[20:40:15] <skill> so to xx's point they can grab whatever they want, if they choose to
[20:40:39] <skill> but if you don't care about that threat model and still want to encrypt, find a vps that provides you the option to encrypt your FS on install
[20:41:00] <skill> but they control/own the hardware layer, so if your threat model doesn't allow for that then your options are very limited
[20:41:04] <skill> it's like aws
[20:41:20] <xx> skill: or if they are asked to by whoever the adversary might be

[21:08:56] <adderall> I sort of have a less common opinion about the VPS cloud situations. If the provider is in one of the five eyes or has an agreement with your country. Or, if they take logs. Or, if there's a backdoor, somoene could still get access to the data.

[21:13:57] <adderall> Shit's going to hit the fan when a blackhat finds a way to penetrate one of those cloud stadiums and runs a worm that infiltrates all of the servers. Imagine if someone had control over all of AWS.
[21:14:31] <ajak> i don't think this is a problem anyone else is worried about, because it relies on a very specific malpractice in the VPS provider... and then it's the VPS provider's fault and their responsibility to mitigate
[21:14:33] <BigBitsAndNAS> adderall dedicated server is too much money. I do not like cloud it is too central. So vps is solution but I want secure as possible

[21:16:10] <adderall> I can read English. I just had to do a double take

[21:45:22] <adderall> I got nervous and quickly stopped living in denial about my rootkit. Now your company can hire me

[21:45:40] <adderall> Electrical charge flashes the cells clean
[21:46:19] <adderall> Now I'm on Ubuntu on a dual boot. Drive here is devoted to full-on Ubuntu. I only made the mistake of using my 2 TB drive for Windows and this 500 for Linux
[21:47:27] <labrador> adderall, nice so your rootkit is gone...
