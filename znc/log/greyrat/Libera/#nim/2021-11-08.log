[15:55:21] <PMunch> That being said if you want to get binary data from user input then you can use parseBin from strutils
[15:55:32] <PMunch> There's no bin type in any language

[15:57:24] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> I guess I'm not used to thinking in that way üòâ
[15:58:21] <PMunch> I mean Nim is one of the few languages that allows you to do things like this: https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3EoB
[15:58:53] <PMunch> Where Binary is now it's own type, although still stored as an int internally
[16:00:14] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> Nice example!
[16:00:30] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> 16, 0x10 and 0b00010000 all refer to the same number
[16:00:39] <PMunch> Note that since it's distinct you can't do anything you can do with normal numbers on it
[16:00:47] <PMunch> So no adding, subtracting, etc
[16:01:48] <PMunch> Unfortunately there is no way I know of to just override one procedure for a type like that
[16:02:06] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> if you were to remove the distinct, then normal integer arithmetic would work?
[16:02:08] <PMunch> Removing the distinct makes echo y also output the binary representation
[16:02:44] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> I just noticed
[16:02:45] <PMunch> But yes, removing the distinct basically means that Binary is the same type as int, and conversely that int is the same type as Binary
[16:02:53] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> I just tried removing distinct, and it echos everything as binary
[16:03:01] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> so you need to cast every time if you want something like that
[16:04:19] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> Thank you all for the binary / number lesson üôÇ
[16:04:28] <PMunch> You could of course delay the cast like this: https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3EoG
[16:05:11] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> that's pretty nice

[16:06:28] <FromDiscord> <Rika> ??? failed why
[16:10:53] <PMunch> @evoalg, the important thing to remember is that binary, hex, octal, etc. are just representations of the same number. They are just different number systems representing the same number
[16:11:49] <PMunch> @Rika, good question
[16:12:07] <FromDiscord> <evoalg> gotcha ok thank you PMunch

[16:22:18] <FromDiscord> <Zoom> @dom96\: why is there no support for i386 systems for choosenim? It builds just fine on linux, just can't install it without building. Is it too hard to maintain?
[16:25:14] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> I have a question though. Suppose I'm on Linux, and I would like to add a path for nim files that would be checked for when I import something‚Üµin nim.cfg there's a bunch of ``path='$lib/something`` lines, so I tried to add yet another line of those pointing to a location inside my home directory but it didn't work. The only way I was able to make it work was to start the path with the $lib variable and use a relative path to that

[17:00:50] <Amun-Ra> nim.cfg and path = "‚Ä¶"
[17:02:23] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> if I put something like this in there ``path="~/projects/nim/common"`` it does not work. Is there some implicit limitations on what can be put there
[17:02:39] <Amun-Ra> '~' may be a problem
[17:03:59] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> now I'm not sure, but I feel like I tried a path without ~ too, but I have to recheck. I wonder what would be a typical place to store this kind of stuff on linux
[17:04:36] <Amun-Ra> check /etc/nim/nim.cfg
[17:05:19] <Amun-Ra> and $HOME/.config/nim/nim.cfg for user configurable data
[17:05:51] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> maybe $HOME would work instead of ~?
[17:06:01] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> didn't try that
[17:06:15] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> does it work when you give an absolute path?
[17:07:03] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> all I know is that I tried several options, and the only thing that seemed to work is when I started the path with "$lib" just like the other entires
[17:07:11] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> but I guess I have to recheck
[17:08:11] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> I literally installed linux for the first time on Friday so I'm not quite up to speed üò≥
[17:09:26] <Amun-Ra> plain absolute path without ~ nor env. vars should work
[17:10:58] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> so in that case, is /etc/ a good place? I don't have multiple users on my pc but still would feel natural to me to have those things stored in my home dir
[17:11:23] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> `/etc` is the systemwide configuration
[17:11:52] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> in theory, i depends where the folder is, an who has write access to it
[17:12:52] <FromDiscord> <enthus1ast> when you put your userhome on path, and root tries to compile stuff, then the root user would import stuff from YOUR home folder, and since nim can execute stuff on compile time, you have a local privilege exploit \:)

[21:23:47] <FromDiscord> <vazub> Hello everyone! Sorry if this is a stupid question and maybe answered many times elsewhere, but are bundled Nim tests supposed to have 100% pass? For a bit more context, I downloaded and built Nim 1.6.0 from source, on Fedora 34 (x86\_64), but when I run `./koch tests`, quite a lot of them fail. Is this known and/or expected?
[21:25:05] <FromDiscord> <vazub> I mean, I would assume by default, that for a release, these should pass 100%, and yet they don't, at least not in my case.

[21:47:01] <FromDiscord> <IsaacPaul> I get 20+ failures
[21:47:07] <FromDiscord> <leorize> of the top of my head you need\: valgrind, libsdl 1.2, sfml, nodejs
[21:47:22] <FromDiscord> <vazub> I've found only `valgrind` and `nodejs` so far, but not sure about others. Is there a definite list of those?
[21:48:01] <FromDiscord> <leorize> unfortunately not, but you can look at CI configuration
[21:48:19] <FromDiscord> <IsaacPaul> ah
[21:49:50] <FromDiscord> <leorize> however libsdl and sfml is only used in a few tests, so 20 failing tests is weird
[21:50:25] <FromDiscord> <leorize> have you installed libc debug info for valgrind?
[21:50:49] <FromDiscord> <leorize> and it'd be nice to get a list of failing tests on your machine
