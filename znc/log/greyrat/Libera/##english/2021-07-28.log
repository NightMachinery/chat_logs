[17:46:20] <theguest> hi everycorpses, I have a question, I'm not sure if I can use "If you can..." to make a polite request. Example: if you can, take out the trash before you leave. 
[17:46:44] <theguest> here "if you can" means "I'd like you to do it, if it's not a problem for you, if you are willing to, if you have time"
[17:47:28] <theguest> but I'm afraid of language interference, often I wonder if something actually sounds good in English of if I'm just making it up
[17:51:34] <StayHungry> theguest: "[could you possibly] take out the trash before you leave [, please]?"

[17:53:02] <theguest> yeah, those are of course very polite ways. Actually, I'm aware that "if you can" won't sound as polite as most other options.
[17:53:06] <twb> theguest: I would probably understand that
[17:53:24] <twb> theguest: "Could you X?" is probably more common
[17:54:08] <StayHungry> theguest: don't let excessive politeness get in the way of order. trash should be taken out :)
[17:54:46] <theguest> however I'm not really worried about the politeness, more about the structure, if it's relatively common (idiomatic) or if I'm just making it up. On second thought, maybe I'd better replace if if "if you have any time left" or "if it's not a problem for you" etc.
[17:54:57] <twb> I had to train my parents not to say "could you X"
[17:55:51] <StayHungry> rare human being is willing to do extra, mind that when begin with "if" clause
[17:56:11] <twb> "Please X" is imperative, where a literal reading of "Could you X?" is merely an inquiry into one's capabilities
[17:56:41] <twb> Yes, Mum, I *could* stop playing video games and mow the cat, but I don't want to.
[17:56:50] <theguest> Could you shut the fuck up? - Well, if I tried really hard, I guess I could. LOL
[17:57:21] <StayHungry> basically it is all bells and whistles to sweeten the pill
[17:57:50] <theguest> that's prescriptive grammar though. Nobody would take "could you x" literally, it's used for requests all the time (and idiomatic)
[17:58:20] <theguest> it's like the old joke "can I go to the bathroom", and the teacher replies "Can you?" Meh, it's just a joke
[17:58:24] <StayHungry> actually, you can make it more meaningful, at least to some.... by adding could you [be so kind] to
[17:58:56] <StayHungry> since i'm inclined be kind today, i possibly could

[19:30:30] <kurahaupo> There are 3 main roots of humour: violence, sex, and wordplay. Most people are only amused by 1 or 2 of them.

[19:34:19] <kurahaupo> errwuuurkchhh
[19:34:31] <CuriosTiger> dracula: Oh, some of the references are fairly obscure. To take the example cited, everyone can understand why Donald Knuth would be alarmed at an intruder in his house, but most people won't know who Donald Knuth is, and won't be familiar with TeX and its impenetrable syntax.
[19:35:12] <twb> CuriosTiger: that comic is not about TeX it's about Knuth writing the seminal work on computer science
[19:35:16] <dracula> CuriosTiger: granted. but this is funny because the little i've seen of Knuth, this is how i expect him to behave. this element of original humour is missing in most of the other clips.
[19:35:55] <twb> It would work just as well if it was e.g. Maynard-Keynes or Adam Smith and the question was about the political economy
[19:36:30] <dracula> CuriosTiger: most of the jokes work on the tier of "Descartes went to a bar and when the tender asked for a drink. "It think not...."
[19:36:33] <twb> it's a joke about Appeal to Authority
[19:36:58] <CuriosTiger> twb: Perhaps not, but TeX is known for exactly the kind of inconsistency cueball complains about.
[19:37:59] <twb> Anyway there's a much better joke about that
[19:38:13] <twb> Should array indices start at 0 or 1?  My suggested compromise of 0.5 was rejected without, I thought, proper consideration.  -- Stan Kelly-Bootle

[19:38:40] <dracula> twb: who is this person?
[19:38:53] <twb> dracula: he wrote the devil's DP dictionary, I think?

[23:39:27] <bin> as a kid I was taught "i before e, except after c"
[23:45:53] <huf> yeah these never work :)
[23:49:03] <Oleg> why is it not wrong to omit the word "is" after "absence" in this sentence: "There is a straightforward ethical argument to be made for vaccine mandates: Herd immunity is a collective good and its absence a collective harm, so vaccination cannot be a matter solely of personal choice."? I am referring to this article: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/opinion/vaccine-mandates-covid.html
[23:49:42] <Oleg> as you can see, it says "...absence a collective harm" and there is no "is" that follows "absence"

[23:58:24] <Oleg> bin: and that sentence would still be grammatically correct if it said "...its absence is a collective harm..."?
[23:58:35] <huf> yeah
[23:58:49] <bin> yep
