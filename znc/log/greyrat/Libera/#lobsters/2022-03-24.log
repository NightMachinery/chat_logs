[03:02:51] <indigo> What kind of dev work
[03:02:55] <explorier> Wish I could get a 16" but they're mad expensive
[03:03:15] <indigo> And what's your budget
[03:03:17] <explorier> I work on a Shopify site & several React apps
[03:03:39] <explorier> under $3k would be really ideal since I'm a freelancer
[03:04:14] <explorier> 13" is fine though, that's what I have now & I'm content with it
[03:04:29] <explorier> also do design & some animation with After Effects
[03:04:40] <explorier> but mostly use an external monitor for all that

[03:34:01] <technomancy> modding? how could you mod a device that's like 1cm thick?
[03:36:10] <bsandro> just couple of pieces of thermal pads
[03:36:48] <bsandro> so it starts conveying heat to the bottom lid; gets somewhat hot if you use it on your lap but heat dissipation becomes vastly better
[03:36:51] <bsandro> no more throttling
[03:37:01] <technomancy> huh, no kidding
[03:37:57] <bsandro> it becomes on par with mbp pro (not max/pro, regular one) and even outperforms it slightly
[03:38:40] <bsandro> because there is a small delay before mbp fan kicks in and some throttling still occures there

[03:51:51] <technomancy> honestly I think making netsurf good is more feasible
[03:52:50] <technomancy> no one has the resources necessary to fork firefox and actually be responsible about security updates, unless you can find a millionaire to do this out of the goodness of their so-called heart
[03:53:33] <c355E3B> Netsurf is decently close to usable
[03:53:50] <c355E3B> I wish Presto didn't land in the garbage bin
[03:54:02] <technomancy> it'd be a lot closer if it had keyboard shortcuts, but yeah
[03:54:32] <technomancy> and adding keyboard shortcuts to netsurf is a hell of a lot easier than keeping up with the firehose of CVEs around a firefox fork
[03:55:39] <c355E3B> I have a team that wants me to host headless browsers for them, don't get me started on keeping up with the firefox CVEs

[09:13:13] <feoh> I haven't tried Netsurf though, I'll check it out.
[09:13:20] <enterprisey> nooo don't mess with my daydreams of a new rust browser engine

[09:14:23] <enterprisey> too busy with work, and I think the work is higher-impact
[09:14:30] <enterprisey> if I didn't have this job I'd definitely be grinding away, though
[09:14:47] <enterprisey> whoo! 640 people is a lot of people to be doxxing myself to
[09:14:51] <enterprisey> I'll /notice you
[09:15:39] <technomancy> feoh: oh sure; I expect you're right. but we should at least try.
[09:16:18] <enterprisey> I also expect you're right, anyway, but tiny websites are still fun
[09:16:23] <technomancy> "when you get eaten by a bear you fight back; not because you think you're going to win, but because you don't want to give anyone the impression that you're enjoying being eaten by a bear."
[09:16:44] <feoh> enterprisey: Holy cow you work the MIT Tokomak? That is so INCREDIBLY awesome! I point at your reactor all the time when people get arm wavey about nuclear and think the only kind of nuclear is the shitty old kind that's way more likely to melt down :)
[09:17:05] <enterprisey> well, at least the channel isn't publicly logged :>
[09:17:07] <enterprisey> but yeah
[09:17:10] <enterprisey> that's the ol day job

[09:17:59] <feoh> I'm sure they NEED to be
[09:18:11] <enterprisey> in particular, the day they let me post on r/fusion with the CFS flair, I'm sure my head will be too big to fit through doors

[09:19:38] <feoh> apropos of nothing, the 'internetarchive' Python library is pure joy to work with. Like, forget Python for a moment, it's just such a pleasure when someone creates language bindings for a thing you want to work with that just MAKE SENSE.
[09:20:16] <enterprisey> the internet archive has some real top minds in there
[09:20:21] <enterprisey> I respect them a ton
[09:21:43] <enterprisey> at any rate this anime isn't gonna watch itself, nice chatting and see you around
[09:22:10] <enterprisey> would love to talk more about fusion of course :)

[20:11:56] <iDrougge> PHP can't have generics for the same reasons as Go. It adds complexity to a small and beautiful language.
[20:12:57] <technomancy> I know you're joking but it actually is the same reason; the language designers don't bother to understand prior art before running off and doing their thing
[20:13:54] <iDrougge> Haha, only serious.

[21:59:10] <technomancy> you'll have to unpack that one for me
[21:59:18] <JordiGH> It's a lambda calculus thing.
[21:59:41] <technomancy> oh you mean like church encoding?
[21:59:52] <JordiGH> Just like numbers are sets in set theory, (e.g. 3 = {0, 1, 2}, recursively), you can build numbers out of lambdas.
[21:59:55] <technomancy> numbers can be represented by functions; that's different from numbers are functions.

[22:01:58] <technomancy> yeah I think you secretly understand
[22:02:30] <JordiGH> I always thought set theory was pretty elegant here. You define functions in terms of sets and you only bottom out on two undefined concepts: sets and "is member of".
[22:02:43] <JordiGH> Formalism is cute.
[22:02:56] <JordiGH> Who cares what it is. It's whatever fits into this logical formula.
[22:03:23] <technomancy> oh yeah, sure. but you don't even have to go that far to get to "functions aren't functions but data structures are" =)
[22:03:32] <JordiGH> You can do things other than set theory... like lambda calculus. But you also bottom out somewhere. I think functions are undefined in lambda calculus.

[22:58:41] <technomancy> I'd consider wayland if I could get it to work with my key bindings but without that it seems like a huge leap backwards
[22:59:15] <feoh> I wouldn't think key bindings would be an issue with Wayland? But I'm actually kind of Wayland ignorant, I really know more about old fashioned X11

[22:59:47] <technomancy> in xorg my WM can force firefox to accept emacs keys. I've asked around a lot and no one knows how to make wayland do that.
[23:00:05] <technomancy> it's super bad
[23:00:21] <wrl> feoh: it's a shift in responsibility. in Xorg, any app can do whatever it wants with the keyboard. in wayland, that's not the case.
[23:00:26] <feoh> Ah gotcha. Makes sense. I have no quibbles with X. I can understand why people felt like the architecture needed a rethink but I'm really not anything like qualified to make intelligent comment.
[23:00:34] <wrl> keybinds become the compositor's responsibility

[23:01:04] <feoh> I will say I've always found the idea of X11 displays conceptually attractive even if I rarely uesd them remotely. Supposedly waypipe helps wiht this?
[23:02:28] <technomancy> wrl: right now in my setup, Emacs intercepts all key input, and depending on the focused program, it converts (for instance) ctrl-p to up-arrow, ctrl-n to down-arrow, before sending the input events to the X client
[23:02:52] <wrl> technomancy: only when emacs is focused, or all the time?

[23:05:35] <wrl> yeah, so your issue here is "i have a specific WM that i like and nobody's written an equivalent wayland compositor yet"
[23:06:08] <technomancy> sure; that's one way to put it

[23:09:12] <river> im not sure what the point of wayland is
[23:09:17] <river> xorg seems to work?
[23:09:26] <wrl> eh, for various values of "work"
[23:09:27] <river> updates = everything breaks
[23:09:37] <kline> river, whats the point of linux, windows seems to work
[23:09:40] <technomancy> xorg has problems but none of them actually matter to me
[23:09:47] <river> so im not keen unless there are some big wins
[23:09:59] <river> hate that form of dismissal
[23:10:13] <technomancy> river: mixed-DPI seems to be the main one
[23:10:20] <kline> wayland should really be one of these entirely behind the scenes changes, people shouldnt really be advocating massively either way
[23:10:28] <wrl> and tbqh xwayland works really well
[23:10:30] <technomancy> which ... I'd rather just buy a new monitor than give up all these awesome features
[23:10:35] <kline> but basically xorg kind of works _despite_ its design rather than because of it in 2022
[23:10:38] <technomancy> wrl: oh god; I wish it worked
[23:10:41] <wrl> basically transparently X-on-top-of-wayland
[23:10:48] <wrl> technomancy: well, it does, but your usecase is... uncommon.
[23:10:50] <river> that basically describes everything on a UNIX computer
[23:10:52] <kline> theres a lot that doesnt match up with the realities of modern desktop computing

[23:10:55] <technomancy> I get so many display glitches in xwayland it basically made me stop using that whole machine
[23:11:05] <kline> river, yeah, so lets work on fixing it, starting with x vs wayland
[23:11:12] <wrl> i've been running xwayland with various bits of proprietary music software for about the last 1.5 years
[23:11:25] <river> all im getting is that youre a big fan of wayland
[23:11:29] <kline> me?
[23:11:33] <kline> i dont even use wayland
[23:11:34] <wrl> both of the computers i use on a daily basis (ryzen desktop + 5700XT GPU, framework laptop) are fully wayland
[23:12:02] <wrl> there's various bits of X software that runs through Xwayland seamlessly
[23:12:31] <wrl> i mean the thing is, kline is right ‚Äì xorg hasn't really matched the way that graphical environments work for quite some time
[23:12:49] <kline> ultimately people should be bumped up to wayland without even noticing, with xwayland and improving wayland support
[23:13:23] <wrl> wayland is a bunch of the xorg devs going "you know what, we'd be saving ourselves a lot of trouble if we stopped trying to fix this and just redid it from zero"
[23:13:25] <kline> its just an enabling technology, but it does improve the way that client applications do their graphics
[23:13:31] <companion_cube> wrl: 20 years ago
[23:13:37] <wrl> companion_cube: hm?
[23:13:39] <companion_cube> and they're still not done

[23:14:04] <wrl> i feel like a *lot* of people are spoiled by how good xorg got
[23:14:12] <companion_cube> it's honestly not possible to "bump up to wayland" since you need to replace 100% of your tools
[23:14:12] <wrl> but xorg was *nasty* even pre-2010
[23:14:24] <kline> companion_cube, what do you mean by tools
[23:14:26] <companion_cube> your WM, your launcher, your screenshot tool, etc.
[23:14:31] <companion_cube> all of them must go
[23:14:39] <wrl> all of the stuff that people are complaining that wayland can't do right now is stuff that xorg couldn't do for a long time either
[23:14:49] <kline> companion_cube, a lot of them already have drop-in wayland replacements
[23:14:56] <companion_cube> not really, no
[23:15:02] <companion_cube> I tried sway: it's not exactly like i3
[23:15:03] <kline> gnome has mutter iirc or something
[23:15:10] <companion_cube> and none of the tools are "drop in"
[23:15:13] <kline> the big DEs already package those tools
[23:15:18] <companion_cube> for a start they don't have the same name :D

[23:15:26] <kline> there are drop in replacements for other standalone WMs
[23:16:27] <wrl> xorg still works for the time being and anybody is welcome to continue maintaining it
[23:16:34] <kline> (the big winning one is i3->sway because the developer is a mega fan of wayland)
[23:16:41] <kline> (and i3)
[23:16:47] <wrl> but yeah all of the people who *were* maintaining it defected to wayland because xorg was just that nasty
[23:16:49] <companion_cube> still not a replacement, kline
[23:16:57] <technomancy> being able to rebind the keys feels like a very basic table-stakes user empowerment thing
[23:17:00] <kline> whats not good enough in sway, companion_cube ?
[23:17:13] <wrl> technomancy: your issue isn't really key rebinding, to be fair
[23:17:15] <companion_cube> small things, but like, the scratch pad is not nearly as good :D
[23:17:17] <technomancy> leaving it out is like shipping a browser that doesn't have greasemonkey included; it's just plain incomplete
[23:17:24] <companion_cube> it's like vim bindings in VSCode or whatever
[23:17:30] <companion_cube> they're mostly like vim, but they don't feel like it
[23:17:34] <kline> companion_cube, have you spoken to the maintainers about it?
[23:17:43] <companion_cube> I try not to speak too much to ddevault
[23:17:48] <companion_cube> and even then, I have no stakes in there
[23:17:52] <wrl> ddevault hasn't maintained sway in like 2+ years
[23:17:52] <kline> ddv isnt the maintainer and hasnt been for a while
[23:17:58] <companion_cube> I'm not going to use it unless X literally stops working on me
[23:17:59] <wrl> it was emersion last i checked
[23:18:08] <kline> yeah
[23:18:10] <companion_cube> (mostly because of all the other tools)
[23:18:15] <kline> hes a good guy, ive met them at fosdem
[23:18:24] <wrl> i mean, again, xorg will probably continue to work
[23:18:33] <technomancy> companion_cube: the only reason I even tried wayland is that I bought a laptop that doesn't work with xorg because I heard "xwayland works fine" (it doesn't)
[23:18:43] <companion_cube> yeah, if we can keep using xorg I'm fine
[23:18:56] <companion_cube> just tired of hearing people say that X should die and we should all move to wayland
[23:19:06] <companion_cube> ("people" including ddevault, ofc)

[23:19:46] <companion_cube> they're maintaining other things :D
[23:19:54] <companion_cube> jmiven: I'm not asking anything :D
[23:19:59] <companion_cube> if X keeps working, good
[23:20:06] <companion_cube> if it breaks, well then I'll be forced to migrate, I guess.

[23:22:12] <companion_cube> I think last time I tried wayland, I moved back again, for the same reason: screen sharing didn't work

[23:23:06] <feoh> wrl: FWIW I see the benefits of Wayland, and tbh it's nice to see such a seismic change happening at the pace that it is.
[23:23:41] <wrl> feoh: yeah, i mean, i have my own pain points with it for sure, but i had pain points with X too and moved away from it for a reason
[23:23:52] <wrl> part of the reason was that I've done Xlib programming and i know what an absolute shitshow X is ;)
[23:24:22] <wrl> it's growing pains, but as somebody who's been using X since... 2004? i think, maybe a year or two before that
[23:24:26] <wrl> i got to see X go through them too
[23:24:43] <wrl> i remember when Xrender was the new hot shit, i remember needing to use ffmpeg for screen recording
[23:24:47] <technomancy> wonder if it'd be an easier sell if people weren't still aching from the pulseaudio fiasco
[23:25:12] <river> if it aint broke dont fix it
[23:25:14] <feoh> I've heard a LOT of good things about Pipewire
[23:25:15] <river> i say
[23:25:19] <wrl> i'm still sour about pulseaudio too
[23:25:21] <kline> technomancy, the problem is that the audio stack replaces every 10 years and we're about to start having pains with pipewire, which will land as the default in the next debian in about a year
[23:25:36] <wrl> i try pipewire out about once every ~3-5 months and it's not quite there yet
[23:25:41] <technomancy> kline: pipewire at least isn't lennart, so ...
[23:25:45] <wrl> but it's quite close to being "there" actually
[23:25:51] <kline> "the world hurts from <change x> so we cant do <change y>" is never going to not be the case in linux
[23:26:05] <companion_cube> wrl: tbh, it feels like wayland is better than X; sway, almost as good as i3; but the *rest* is where it totally fails for me
[23:26:20] <companion_cube> like, give me rofi, and screensharing that works
[23:26:24] <wrl> companion_cube: oh yeah for sure. i get frustrated whenever i can't take screenshots with GIMP
[23:26:44] <wrl> screensharing definitely still falls down (unless you're screensharing from one Xwayland app to another, hehheheheh)
[23:26:45] <feoh> I thought the Gnome and KDE peeps had screen sharing working?
[23:26:52] <wrl> that might be the case
[23:27:27] <companion_cube> idk but it's doesn't "just work", and it's quite opaque what happens
[23:27:50] <wrl> yeah i think we might have another year or so of that
[23:27:52] <wrl> imo
[23:28:38] <river> reminder predictable network interface names
[23:28:40] <wrl> it's obnoxious but Xorg was held together with duck tape and we're lamenting the loss of some of the hackery
