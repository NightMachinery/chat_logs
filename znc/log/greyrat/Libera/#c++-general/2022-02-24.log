[00:55:38] <Alipha> cahoots: from my understanding, the compact unwind tables contain the information for what needs to be done for each stack frame during the unwinding process. and so, it contains what destructors need to be run and if there are any catch blocks in the function
[00:56:20] <Alipha> so yes, following the return addresses will give you a backtrace, but the program needs to know what to do at each point in that backtrace

[01:05:54] <Hello71> whether stack frames always contain base pointers is part of the ABI and varies by implementation
[01:06:28] <Hello71> gcc omits frame pointers on all architectures by default with -O(2?), *except* aarch64
[01:07:02] <Hello71> but that's for historical reasons, not anything inherent to the isa
[01:07:25] <cahoots> Hello71, so backtrace on apple platforms is probably just taking advantage of that fact?
[01:07:27] <Hello71> the article briefly mentions this
[01:07:41] <Hello71> yes, apple can set their toolchain to generate frame pointers by default

[01:15:23] <imMute> CarloWood: *you* know that, but the compiler can't.
[01:15:36] <CarloWood> In my eyes that means it is trivially copyable. It's just that std::is_trivially_copyable_v can't figure that out.

[01:18:30] <imMute> rpav: why would we even care if the compiler can detect that a no-member object can be trivially copied even though it has a non-default copy ctor???

[02:19:45] <PJBoy> can't help the advance(it, -1) case though
[02:19:49] <apteryx> I had something like "const char* rpath = realPath.utf8().data();" in webkitgtk, and it was pointed to me that this was use-after-free
[02:20:04] <Alipha> PJBoy: yeah, I'll accept that as UB
[02:20:16] <PJBoy> yeah I agree then
[02:20:23] <PJBoy> although
[02:20:28] <kalven> soman: instead of using prev, start with the first iterator and get next(it) in the loop, but compare the next iterator with .end() before you use it
[02:20:40] <PJBoy> nah scratch that although
[02:21:01] <soman> kalven: thanks, sounds like a solution.
[02:21:28] <Alipha> apteryx: temporaries live until the end of the statement they're on. That is, until the ;
[02:22:03] <CarloWood> apteryx: it is if utf8() returns something by value - ie, std::string.  Then the pointer data() points to freed memory the next line.
[02:22:11] <soman> What about std::ranges::prev then? Does it allow to go in both directions with unordered_map or it still UB?
[02:22:50] <Alipha> soman: std::ranges::prev will give a compile error instead of mysteriously causing UB at runtime
[02:22:51] <CarloWood> soman: just write it without using std::prev
[02:23:11] <soman> Ok, big thanks to all replied!
[02:23:23] <apteryx> Alipha: OK, thanks
[02:23:31] <CarloWood> auto prev = it++;
[02:23:50] <apteryx> CarloWood: so the only way is to manually invoke something that copies it?  There's no way in having the compiler figure that for us?
[02:23:59] <Alipha> soman: std::unordered_map iterators have no --, so it's impossible to get the previous iterator
[02:26:10] <soman> Alipha: ok, now it's clear.
[02:27:40] <Alipha> apteryx: the compiler would have to know to keep the std::string returned by utf8() alive for as long as the const char* is used, which is a very difficult problem to solve in all but the most trivial cases.
[02:29:21] <apteryx> I see.  Basically it'd need reference counting with GC or something.
[02:29:57] <Alipha> Rust has the "borrow checker"
[02:31:21] <apteryx> I see.  I didn't know the borrow checked solved that problem.

[02:35:54] <Alipha> from what i've heard, Rust programmers aren't huge fans of the borrow checker. though i think it just forces you to think about lifetimes, which they would need to be doing anyway in a language like c++
[02:36:30] <CarloWood> std::string rpath = realPath.utf8();  is perfectly fine code
[02:36:37] <kalven> sounds like you've been talking to rust heretics.
[02:37:10] <Alipha> i'm just repeating what i've heard from the rumor mill :-)

[02:38:53] <kalven> but hey.. it's only 3pm
[02:39:05] <cq-work> I don't think it's that dumb. People don't like having to manage lifetimes of their variables.
[02:39:08] <Alipha> kalven is on the pacific!
[02:39:18] <CarloWood> I don't know anything about Rust. I am just summarizing what I just saw on the channel :p
[02:39:54] <cq-work> You have to explicitly give a marker on variables that live outside of some scope, that confuses people, so they don't like it.
[02:40:31] <CarloWood> Lifetimes are easy: when it crashes you did something wrong.
[02:40:42] <cq-work> C++ doesn't force you to do that, C++ doesn't care if your variable lives inside a scope, outside a scope, or on the moon
[02:41:03] <kalven> it crashes if you're lucky
[02:41:05] <cq-work> Well, "lives" might be a bad word.
[02:41:25] <Alipha> the compiler doesn't. but objects have lifetimes and you better code in agreement with them
[02:42:17] <Shell> also the compiler totally does and if you fuck up it'll just miscompile your code. sometimes. :)

[02:43:37] <Alipha> you make it sound like the compiler has malicious intent.
[02:44:02] <Shell> not really, just that it's not amazingly helpful.
[02:47:40] <cq-work> Clang at least has some lifetime analysis functionality. Unfortunately, it can't be perfect since it's hard to tell when a variable is supposed to live in a certain scope.

[03:00:34] <soman> kalven: for example move it to other vector with std::move(i). If I will write int &i + std::move(i) then it will work but I want to find out why
[03:00:57] <kalven> it'll always take a move.. once you have a name for it, it's no longer an rvalue
[03:01:42] <kalven> like.. void foo(string&& s)  { /* s is not an rvalue here */ }
[03:03:23] <Alipha> `for (int &&i: intVector) { /* do something */ }` is equilavent to `for(auto it = intVector.begin(); it != intVector.end(); ++it) { int &&i = *it; /* do something */ }` which that `int &&i = *it;` is not legal because *it returns a int& to the element

[03:55:32] <kalven> the virtual destructor is a bit special in that you typically want one in the base class.. the constructors are all about what kind of interface you want to give your class

[03:57:21] <very_sneaky> and if you default your virtual destructor, you should implement all special member functions, even if just to default them

[13:19:02] <ville> LordKalma: removing something from a vector and an element being in a moved-from state are different things
[13:20:19] <ville> and yes std::map does have operator [] that takes a key&&, so yeah i'd expect it would leave the strings in the vector in moved-from state.
[13:20:48] <LordKalma> ah using the move constructors?
[13:21:12] <ville> not going to bet on the internals
[13:22:23] <ville> the elements being in a moved-from state would still leave the vector's size intact
[13:22:32] <LordKalma> yeah yeah, I get it now, thanks
[13:23:38] <ville> not sure if it has-to-has-to call move ctor if the element already exists in the map. these days it's bit of ann adventure to try to find out what actually happens there
[13:23:54] <ville> it certainly could

[13:54:14] <PJBoy> well for unordered_map I'm done now
[13:54:57] <ville> what are piecewise_construct and so on
[13:55:53] <PJBoy> piecewise_construct is a tag value you pass to pair to say its element arguments are constructed from those two tuples of arguments
[13:56:21] <PJBoy> so the key of the pair is constructed from the `k` argument of try_emplace
[13:56:29] <PJBoy> and the value of the pair is constructed from the args...
[13:57:00] <PJBoy> and there's lots of forwards, so you assume perfect forwarding

[14:02:10] <PJBoy> also wow, they really used make_pair for map::operator[] before?

[14:32:18] <LordKalma> explain
[14:33:37] <PJBoy> I have only just started looking at it
[14:33:46] <LordKalma> but explain what the problem is
[14:34:18] <Haohmaru> his build system is acting barbaric
[14:34:26] <LordKalma> no, that0s barbarian
[14:34:27] <PJBoy> obviously this package we want to build needs to know where a certain include directory is
[14:34:43] <PJBoy> and allegedly only conan knows where that include directory will be
[14:34:52] <PJBoy> because it puts it there
[14:35:38] <LordKalma> you want to use a dependency
[14:35:39] <LordKalma> ?
[14:36:27] <PJBoy> yeah
[14:36:37] <LordKalma> using include directories from dependencies is trivial...
[14:36:44] <PJBoy> that's good
[14:36:59] <LordKalma> if the depency recipe is well made, if you use cmake_find_package generator, just use target_link_libraries as usual
[14:37:05] <LordKalma> it's that simple
[14:37:30] <LordKalma> (with find_package before)
[14:37:40] <LordKalma> if the dependency has a canonical find_package name, CCI tries to follow
[14:37:50] <PJBoy> I'll bring up the gory details a bit later
[14:37:52] <LordKalma> otherwise it's usually soemthing sensible like nameofdependency
[14:37:57] <PJBoy> fwiw none of these packages are in CCI
[14:38:07] <LordKalma> and the target nameofdependency::nameofdependency
[14:38:08] <PJBoy> so we have home grown recipes
[14:38:19] <LordKalma> hahah well, if it's in house, I sure hope you did them right :p
[14:38:33] <PJBoy> healthy skepticism
[14:39:03] <LordKalma> but by default conan assumes that in the package include/ is the include directoryu
[14:40:01] <LordKalma> https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/blob/master/recipes/miniaudio/all/conanfile.py#L27
[14:40:04] <LordKalma> and it "just works" :D
[14:41:58] <LordKalma> and with a cmake_find_package generator you're use find_package(miniaudio) and then target_link_libraries(mything PRIVATE miniaudio::miniaudio)
[14:42:15] <LordKalma> when you don't define a canonical name it defaults to this https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/blob/master/recipes/miniaudio/all/conanfile.py#L7
[14:42:33] <PJBoy> "we apply a patch to the libA source code that stops cmake from building the libB code included with libA, instead we pass -I<libC_include_dir> where libC includes libB"

[17:06:59] <PJBoy> that's crazy
[17:07:00] <LordKalma> nope
[17:07:15] <LordKalma> it generates whatever the generator you're using
[17:07:28] <PJBoy> but all the supporting CMake files
[17:07:33] <PJBoy> i.e. CMakeFiles/
[17:07:39] <LordKalma> cmake_find_packaage generates a FindMylib.cmake
[17:07:55] <PJBoy> yeah that much makes sense
[17:08:34] <PJBoy> there's also stuff here with CMakeToolchain(self) though
[17:08:46] <PJBoy> I was expecting its .generate() to make a CMakeLists.txt
[17:08:54] <LordKalma> no no
[17:09:01] <LordKalma> CMakeToolchain is to *build* from a cmakelists
[17:09:03] <LordKalma> not generate it
[17:09:07] <PJBoy> oh ok ok
[17:09:54] <PJBoy> that does the .generate() method do then?
[17:09:54] <LordKalma> oh no, nevermind
[17:09:57] <LordKalma> it's another generator
[17:10:00] <LordKalma> sorry
[17:10:03] <PJBoy> ok yeah
[17:10:04] <LordKalma> https://docs.conan.io/en/1.44/reference/conanfile/tools/cmake/cmaketoolchain.html
[17:10:08] <LordKalma> it's an experimental generator
[17:10:14] <LordKalma> that generates a toolchain file
[17:10:20] <LordKalma> (isn't this that vcpkg does?)
[17:10:27] <PJBoy> oh yeah of course, right
[17:10:31] <PJBoy> (idk about vcpkg)
[17:10:43] <PJBoy> yeah that's the idea here supposedly
[17:10:57] <LordKalma> https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/blob/master/recipes/fftw/all/conanfile.py#L67
[17:11:03] <LordKalma> the CMake build wrapper is just called CMake
[17:11:45] <PJBoy> my collegue wanted to make a custom toolchain that just appends an option to CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_INIT
[17:11:55] <PJBoy> which has the -I option in it
[17:11:58] <LordKalma> bah, that's shit
[17:12:09] <PJBoy> yeah it's not good
[17:12:13] <PJBoy> but it was an attempt
[17:12:25] <PJBoy> also it doesn't work
[17:12:32] <LordKalma> it's best to write an actually proper cmake build graph :D
[17:12:39] <LordKalma> instead of harcoding it in a hack
[17:12:41] <PJBoy> idk why but it loses those changes made to that variable
[17:12:58] <PJBoy> that's the other thing we're doing
[17:13:28] <PJBoy> asking some guy from the other department why they're patching out the include of this dependency just so it can use that same dependency from somewhere else
[17:13:44] <PJBoy> possibly a different version of that dependency
[17:14:03] <PJBoy> but I felt like we should know how to work around this *anyway*
[17:15:44] <PJBoy> also
[17:15:57] <PJBoy> I had to update conan for this
[17:16:12] <LordKalma> that's an experimental generator
[17:16:13] <PJBoy> but before, it didn't give me any errors when trying to generate this toolchain
[17:16:15] <LordKalma> so yeah, it's not surprising
[17:16:33] <PJBoy> obviously we should have a conan minimum version check
[17:16:38] <PJBoy> but I'm surprised it didn't fail
[17:17:02] <PJBoy> but yeah, experimental
[17:20:12] <LordKalma> I recomend cmake_find_package (+ cmake_paths which sometimes helps) for now
[17:20:16] <LordKalma> and CMakeDeps after conan 2.0
[17:20:38] <PJBoy> yeah we're using that
[17:21:07] <PJBoy> so that gets us our FindX.cmake files
[17:21:38] <PJBoy> and then it's just a question of how to specify this one extra include directory
[17:22:56] <PJBoy> and the current idea is to do so via a custom toolchain
[17:23:03] <PJBoy> which seems somewhat reasonable?
[17:24:11] <PJBoy> I think if I were working on the CMakeLists.txt directly, I'd pass `mydep_INCLUDES` as set by the Findmydep.cmake file somehow
[17:24:34] <PJBoy> and append it to CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
[17:25:18] <PJBoy> acutally it's already there anyway
[17:25:36] <PJBoy> ok now I'm confused

[17:35:37] <LordKalma> If you wanted an extra include directory change the dependency recipe
[17:35:54] <PJBoy> but it's only this one package that wants the extra include directory
[17:35:54] <LordKalma> You can change the package information to explain conan what are the include directories

[17:37:38] <LordKalma> Well, you can change the dependency anyway, or use [ target_]include_directories in the consuming recipe
[17:38:10] <LordKalma> Use include_directories, not CMAKE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
[17:38:18] <PJBoy> target_include_directories is probably gonna be the thing
[17:38:40] <LordKalma> Or CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, whatever

[23:06:07] <rpav> the problem of course is no lazy evaluation
[23:06:41] <rpav> even though it calls the ctor of the value, it doesn't defer evaluation of the arguments, so you may still unnecessarily do things

[23:07:08] <rpav> ah emplace_hint indeed
[23:07:13] <PJBoy> so there, `if (!map.contains(...))` still has a use case
[23:07:29] <PJBoy> for when the args would be needless much calculation
[23:07:37] <rpav> contains is such bullshit
[23:07:43] <rpav> it should return a pointer
[23:07:51] <Alipha> then it's just find
[23:07:51] <PJBoy> then it would be find
[23:07:55] <PJBoy> ish
[23:08:02] <rpav> but it _is_ already find, with discarded effort
[23:08:18] <rpav> i always just use my own findmap which returns a pointer, no need for contains()
[23:08:38] <PJBoy> it saves on checking the found iterator against the map's end iterator
[23:09:03] <PJBoy> returning the end iterator probably has some marginal overhead compared to returning a bool
[23:09:04] <rpav> not really
[23:09:09] <PJBoy> and contains is more expressive
[23:09:31] <ville> i bet you use "and" and "or" too
[23:09:44] <PJBoy> you know I don't

[23:10:13] <ville> the level of expressiveness for those is above 9000
[23:11:00] <PJBoy> `and` and `or` are logical operations, whilst `and_eq`, `or_eq` and `xor` are all bitwise

[23:44:12] <Friithian> it's just a few kg of lsd
[23:44:25] <Friithian> not µg, not g, kg
[23:45:28] <LordKalma> PJBoy ping
[23:45:50] <PJBoy> poo
[23:45:50] <LordKalma> what's the clang-format setting to have the initializing list of a constructor have an element per line?
[23:45:53] <LordKalma> do you know?
[23:46:10] <PJBoy> clang-format I'm not familiar with actually
[23:46:25] <LordKalma> https://i.gyazo.com/9a4082f3ab5d6eefb121b2ae3c6a36ed.png // this looks like shit
[23:47:03] <PJBoy> seems to be PackConstructorInitializers though
[23:47:04] <LordKalma> hum... https://stackoverflow.com/a/59574671
[23:47:07] <LordKalma> yes indeed
[23:47:27] <PJBoy> I hate wrapping styles that do that
[23:47:35] <PJBoy> just bring it down a line and indent four spaces
[23:47:54] <Friithian> >indent >spaces
[23:47:54] <Friithian> reeeeee
[23:48:22] <PJBoy> eh I can't help it if tabs are misused by everyone and mishandled by every tool
[23:48:35] <rpav> they're only misused by people who use them
[23:48:41] <PJBoy> true
[23:48:52] <LordKalma> PackConstructorInitializers: CurrentLine doesn't seem to cut it
[23:49:10] <Friithian> it is an abuse of spaces to use them for indentation
[23:49:25] <rpav> i see the kids have to relearn spaces-not-tabs
[23:49:55] <Friithian> relearn? fucking hell if there's people teaching spaces over tabs they need to be caught and shot now

[23:50:03] <Friithian> (don't worry, that's a hitchhiker's reference)
[23:50:23] <rpav> yeah pretty sure that wasn't in the books heh
[23:50:29] <Friithian> oh it was
[23:50:45] <Friithian> ``if there's something more important than my ego, I want it caught and shot now!''
[23:51:00] <rpav> ok not a very good reference then :P
[23:51:09] <Friithian> it's an excellent refernce, you just didn't get it
[23:51:18] <Friithian> like you don't get how spaces should not be used for indentation
[23:51:37] <rpav> nah it's like tabs .. intent, poorly done

[23:51:59] <Friithian> tabs are perfectly excellent for indentation given how they were built to do so

[23:52:14] <rpav> 👎
[23:52:20] <LordKalma> space team
[23:52:50] <Friithian> uses spaces, uses emojis in irc, figures
[23:53:10] <rpav> tabs are nearly as bad as people who use variable width fonts for code
[23:53:30] <Friithian> what the fuck
[23:53:36] <Friithian> you're insane
[23:53:55] <rpav> like everyone learned this decades ago, but apparently the newbies have to relearn every few years, it's weird
[23:54:31] <LordKalma> I use 4 spaces because I use half-ident for visibility identifiers
[23:54:32] <Friithian> has this channel really fell so far in grace that we have people actively advocating for spaces for indentation? An outrage
[23:54:34] <LordKalma> like public and private
[23:55:02] <rpav> no one needs to _advocate_; it's a settled question that spaces are what you should use
[23:55:12] <rpav> but occasionally someone is clueless enough to think otherwise
[23:55:15] <Friithian> no it sure isn't
[23:55:42] <rpav> LordKalma: i'm actually not sure what i do for public/private, i want to say zero indent but i think actually half
[23:55:57] <LordKalma> just do whatever you want
[23:55:58] <LordKalma> idc
[23:56:08] <rpav> i just push a button and let clang-format do whatever, i haven't changed the settings in awhile and the results are good enough
[23:56:25] <rpav> i mostly only have issues with things that end up error-prone or hard to read/confusing
