[01:34:28] <slaughter> Has anyone completed the Nana devops bootcamp linked in the MOTD?
[01:39:37] <kwilczynski> Here or in general? :)
[01:47:29] <slaughter> Haha well I would be curious in general, though I assume based on what I've seen online that some people have
[01:49:26] <slaughter> I'm currently employed as a devops engineer, though previously I've been a devops-y software engineer and feel like I could use some serious skilling up in a lot of areas. Seems like a well developed program that would probably benefit me but at $1k I'd hate to find out that I already know too much for it to be useful. 
[01:49:40] <slaughter> I definitely don't know everything in it, but have a decent familiarity with a good bit of it

[03:05:19] <slaughter> Well in the list of things that course has I see many things I could do with more education/hands on with: container orchestration, EKS specifically, ansible, monitoring, a good AWS refresher, Jenkins and CI in general
[03:05:36] <slaughter> Also my job will pay for the majority of it. 
[03:06:18] <slaughter> I like the roadmap stuff, I just kinda suck at being accountable after work, programs help me a lot

[04:07:58] <kwilczynski> You don't like it?
[04:11:45] <rawtaz> slaughter: i havent taken that course, but if you already know some of the drill i'd say what you need is not a course/tutorial like this but rather more concrete things to work with, real stuff
[04:14:39] <kwilczynski> Like a neurosurgeon.
[04:14:46] <kwilczynski> You need real brainzzz.
[04:14:48] <kwilczynski> :p
[04:17:55] <slaughter> I mean, I am a devops engineer. I just hate constantly being in a "uhhh fuck I've never touched k8s before" or "oh shit is that CI/CD best practices?" 
[04:31:05] <rawtaz> so set up k8s? you dont need to pay $1000 for that, given all the tons of resources out there
[04:31:19] <rawtaz> but sure, if you want a streamlined teaching to be effective, maybe :L)

[15:47:25] <kwilczynski> You mean the hack?
[15:48:01] <kwilczynski> What is disappointing about this, is that the keys were send over the bus plaintext. Because the fact that you can hack something if you have physical access to a device is nothing new.
[15:50:13] <rawtaz> yeah that is highly pointless..
[15:50:33] <rawtaz> if they hadnt turned on that "auto-decryption" in bitlocker i guess this part of the attack wouldnt have been doable
[15:51:02] <rawtaz> also i dont fancy the auto-vpn thing. sure, it might be a need in large environments, but heck, this is what you get. and it just complicates things as well
[15:51:12] <rawtaz> but yeah, its there for a reason of course

[17:30:41] <rawtaz> it will continue to be so because we'll always be behind the vulns
[17:31:10] <kwilczynski> No, it's not that.
[17:31:23] <kwilczynski> Is the hopeless state of things in IT in enterprises.
[17:32:01] <kwilczynski> :)
[17:34:30] <rawtaz> well those are two different things. i agree with you. but security is also something that will always be unresolved
