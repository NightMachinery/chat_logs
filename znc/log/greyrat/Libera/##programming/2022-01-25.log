[01:57:18] <Decker> but - a lnaguage with reflection, I wouldn't have to specifically build that tree, all code is already in a tree
[01:58:03] <flakland> i guess it makes more sense if you're using a language without addresses or pointers

[05:24:39] <relipse> can I post a link about a game i programmed in 2003 that I re-released today? 
[05:24:42] <bjs> ProfSimm: tbh you spent far more time reading code than writing it (usually) so it's more important the symbols make sense from a readability sense than a ease-of-keyboard-layout sense
[05:24:46] <duuude> ProfSimm: the cost for change and scaring away people (look at lua syntax and 1-index) is more than holding that shift 
[05:25:01] <bjs> ProfSimm: () for functions is kind of far too ingrainged to change, and it might be confusing if you re-use the symbol to mean something else too much
[05:25:04] <ProfSimm> bjs: I have a solution for that.
[05:25:06] <bjs> in-grained*
[05:25:36] <ProfSimm> bjs: I have a quite different idea I'm playing with. Where everything is treated as a literal, unless surrounded by []
[05:25:44] <ProfSimm> bjs: sort of like templating language
[05:25:55] <edgar-rft> I have to use Alt+Gr for [] what is far more awkward than shift.
[05:26:05] <ProfSimm> Hm
[05:26:10] <bjs> ProfSimm: sounds like a good idea, for templating. If every other word in your language has [] around it then it might get tiring very quickly :)
[05:26:10] <duuude> ProfSimm: almost no body complains about those new C-like languages' syntax (python, js, go, etc.)
[05:26:42] <ProfSimm> duuude: of course. 
[05:26:43] <bjs> ProfSimm: if you have to press shift a handful of times per file that might be a slight inconvenience, if you have to type [] many times every line that might just be outright annoying :)
[05:27:20] <bjs> it depends on the kind of programs you write I guess
[05:27:28] <ProfSimm> bjs: in practice it's not more than you type () for function calls in C-like languages I guess

[05:32:40] <edgar-rft> nearly every semi-complicated problem ends up with an at least halfway implementation of Lisp :-)
[05:32:47] <ProfSimm> bjs: the most different thing is that everything is a literal. Identifiers in particular. So if you type  "loop 1 to 100 closure-here" it'll run a closure 100 times. But if you type "var i 10" and "loop 1 to i closure-here" it'll crash because it can't loop from 1 to "identifier i"
[05:32:50] <duuude> ProfSimm: how do you write 'function param function param param param'
[05:33:03] <ProfSimm> bjs: instead you need to mark it as an expression "loop 1 to [i] closure-here"

[05:35:53] <bjs> ProfSimm: yeah I get it, it's a nice idea. This kind of thing is one reason scheme is such a DSL friendly language
[05:36:16] <ProfSimm> Does scheme have some sort of "literals by default" or it's explicit 'quoting with it

[06:33:08] <apotheon> . . . so I used Ctrl-C to get out.

[18:42:26] <koollman> ProfSimm: you're probably confused about math
[18:43:07] <ProfSimm> This is now about whether I'm confused about math, but whether we need math-centric programming languages if they're high level enough
[18:43:10] <koollman> but, it's ok. lets reverse the question entirely: what makes you think math is considered the most important part anyway ? :)
[18:43:32] <ProfSimm> koollman: because math operators are an intrinsic part of every language.
[18:43:39] <jackson99> sorry for repeating the question, but is anyone familiar with 49" monitor that has greater resolution than 5120x1440? I'm pretty sure I saw one a while ago, but maybe I was dreaming??
[18:44:04] <koollman> ProfSimm: so are ways to store data. or ways to read and write
[18:44:49] <Nucleos> My only answer is that most math textbook change very little through years. Some problems we train the young on, it's been 2000 years we use them to teach math. They have been carefully designed and selected over thousands of years and they apparently work very well to teach algorithm (the first algorithm of students is addition of two natural
[18:44:50] <Nucleos> numbers), variables (difference between one variable, two variable problems), etc.
[18:44:51] <koollman> ProfSimm: there are even letters, or words. I'm not sure what that proves, though :)

[18:54:12] <ProfSimm> I think most of you are missing the point of what I'm saying. Math expressions are an important part of every language. Operators, metaphors, vocabulary. In fact, functional languages are entirely modeled after the mathematical model. Where do you think the word "function" comes from anyway
[18:54:49] <ProfSimm> I'm not talking about how we teach programming, but I'm talking about can we reimagine programming languages that are not math-first.
[18:55:31] <ProfSimm> CLI is an example of a paradigm that's not math-first. Writing math expressions is in fact kinda clumsy in most shells
[18:55:49] <ProfSimm> This frees up symbols and patterns for other uses
[18:56:16] <ProfSimm> For example --foo is a parameter name, not "minus minus variable foo"
[18:56:19] <vmLhGHr3> Maybe it is just my opinion, but I feel like programming is not very logical and not mathematical.
[18:57:05] <ProfSimm> vmLhGHr3: well I don't know if I'll go as far as saying it's not logical.
[18:57:11] <bjs> another way of looking at it is that programming *is* doing math,  at least one kind of math.
[18:58:04] <bjs> It's not what you usually think of when someone says "doing math" like in school,  and it's not some crazy mathematician who locks themselves away for 30 years to prove something about the integers.  But it's a practical endeavour that falls under "mathematics", something very close to algebra
[18:58:05] <koollman> austincheney: logic is ... part of math
[18:58:09] <koollman> algorithms, too
[18:58:14] <ProfSimm> bjs: I'm unsure how wide people interpret the term 'math' in this convo
[18:58:21] <austincheney> ProfSimm, if you want to imagine programming that is not math first then start with logic.  Logic is a philosophy (so is math) but math is based upon logic, a high level.  Then focus upon one more philosophy: simplicity (fewer).
[18:58:29] <pulse> algorhythms
[18:58:30] <koollman> math, in the context of programming, isn't really about adding numbers. it's mostly not about that :)
[18:58:34] <vmLhGHr3> Yeah, maybe that is it--the logic is at parts like the logic gates, so I do not really "see" it.
[18:58:42] <bjs> `def f(x): return x + 1` this is basically just doing algebra.
[18:58:50] <austincheney> ProfSimm, I have found most people do not understand simplicity as a concept even after you show it to them
[18:58:55] <ProfSimm> koollman: I don't think it's very useful to define math as simply "any formal model"
[18:59:03] <koollman> ProfSimm: not 'any'.
[18:59:24] <ProfSimm> "any abstract formal model" :)
[18:59:26] <koollman> ProfSimm: but it's not useful to define math as counting and adding. that's algebra
[18:59:30] <bjs> ProfSimm: it depends, "math" is a wide term so you'll get a wide range of views
[19:00:16] <ProfSimm> Fine, let me rephrase the entire conversation then. Should algebra be the "default" context of programming, or a "mode", a DSL in it
[19:00:19] <austincheney> math is concerned with correctness, from which calculations result.  logic is concerned with is or is not from which math results
[19:00:23] <ProfSimm> Let's think about it like that
[19:00:43] <koollman> ProfSimm: I don't think of it as the default, although I can see your point

[19:05:36] <bjs> ProfSimm: just a lot (most) of programming is just manipulation of symbols that stand for some value
[19:06:07] <austincheney> ProfSimm, I think goal in teaching programming is how young can the audience be and how expeditiously can that teaching be applied.  Thus you get stuff like Scratch that wants to imagine programming like putting legos together

[22:05:13] <pyzozord> AeroNotix: yeah I get that
[22:05:23] <AeroNotix> reconciliation in the kubernetes context means to attempt to apply the requested changes, over and over

[23:45:47] <epony> that's because some languages and software vendors intentionally replace terminology to separate cargo cult followers and vertically separate whole eco-systems of software
[23:45:48] <CodeAgain> For instance, I kinda grasp the general idea of front and back end developers, to a certain extent... But, is backend like everything that's not related to GUI interfaces? For instance, kernel developers are backend developers? 
[23:46:03] <seepinto> yes
[23:46:19] <seepinto> GUI and UI
[23:46:27] <seepinto> maybe you count CLI

[23:46:58] <apotheon> When most people speak of "front end" and "back end" dev, though, what they're usually talking about is server-side and client-side web dev.

[23:47:19] <CodeAgain> apotheon that's what I suspected
[23:47:23] <apotheon> that is, code kept on the server, and code shipped to the browser
[23:47:36] <Guest59> AeroNotix phaser bs?
[23:47:39] <AeroNotix> Guest59: e.g. enable3d(() => new Phaser.Game(config)).withPhysics('/lib/ammo/kripken')
[23:47:47] <AeroNotix> you call addElement before this
[23:47:53] <epony> for example, the biggest such problem is functional programming paradigm of renaming and misnaming all parts of the computation for the sake of being "alternative universe that is largely incompatible" to the computing known and used in the real world
[23:47:54] <CodeAgain> So, in the example of a kernel developer, it wouldn't be neither front nor back LOL
[23:47:56] <AeroNotix> suggestion: call addElement in create, not in main
[23:48:06] <apotheon> This even includes code that generates HTML on the server as back end, and plumbing code that runs in the browser as front end, in most such discussions.
[23:48:08] <Decker> Guest59 instead of calling it immediately after creating the class - move that to the create() function probably towards the end

[23:50:25] <Guest59> You suggested executing after that

[23:52:20] <apotheon> I see a red bikeshed and want to paint it black.
[23:52:39] <vdamewood> apotheon: We should paint it blue.
[23:52:48] <CodeAgain> But in the end I thought you'd tell me an specific term for things like kernels, middleware, drivers, etc
[23:52:59] <CodeAgain> LOL
[23:53:07] <vdamewood> Well, the specific term for kernels is 'kernel'.

[23:54:46] <apotheon> Generally speaking, Mick Jagger is such an awful singer that almost anyone can improve the song with a cover, but somehow he just fits that song better than anyone else.  It's weird.
[23:54:50] <apotheon> vdamewood: yes
[23:54:53] <seepinto> and tell me whats inside the object
[23:55:18] <wedr> Guest59, then yeah, your main issue is "third" is an undefined object. You need to figure out how to assign "third" to the object that calls on "load" object and load.gltf()

[23:55:47] <Guest59> this is assigned here
[23:55:50] <wedr> that's not now you load "third"

[23:56:09] <apotheon> Sisters of Mercy did a much better job at Gimme Shelter, for instance.
[23:56:19] <Guest59> so how do I assign more .glb files
[23:56:23] <apotheon> . . . but nobody beats the Stones' rendition of Paint It Black.
[23:56:32] <wedr> because the "third" is inside create().
[23:56:34] <vdamewood> Avoiding that question, I see.
[23:56:43] <apotheon> vdamewood: black
[23:56:46] <pulse> why did i write kirk hammet instead of james hetfield

[23:57:27] <wedr> Guest59, if you do console.log(this.third), do you get back "undefined" in the browser console?

[23:58:13] <wedr> Guest59, add "console.log(this.third)" near the top of both "create()" and "addElement()"

[23:59:33] <apotheon> I don't think I've heard anything by Metallica that I liked since the Black Album, though, other than some cool basslines.
