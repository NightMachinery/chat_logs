[00:17:31] <_az> if my language is not in the list of languages by the app, how I can have it generate the po for it?
[00:17:55] <hylje> _az: put the language in the list of languages and then generate the po
[00:18:45] <_az> I've it in my project but the software I've installed using pip doesn't generate my language. How can I modify that software settings? it's inside vevn
[00:18:48] <_az> venv
[00:19:17] <hylje> when you first configure a new language you have to pass -l LANGCODE to makemessages
[00:19:47] <_az> hmmm, let me try that
[00:26:18] <_az> hylje, man you saved me few days.
[00:26:47] <hylje> no prob
[00:27:42] <hylje> i checked it's all there in the docs https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/i18n/translation/#localization-how-to-create-language-files so you might find your next question and answer there

[04:58:37] <b-rex> can you paste the form class?

[05:02:40] <b-rex> i can't think of any reason why request.user there would be None

[05:03:12] <wallbroken> is this ok?
[05:03:33] <wallbroken> b-rex: in fact i was thinking of it
[05:04:00] <b-rex> a user must be logged in to even access that view
[05:04:21] <b-rex> that might solve the issue of it being None
[05:04:29] <b-rex> the other issue is.
[05:04:45] <b-rex> what if i put is_staff=1 in my request payload?

[05:48:54] <wallbroken> it's in the view?
[05:49:43] <tm007> wallbroken: good morning

[05:53:38] <wallbroken> so, what?
[05:53:43] <FunkyBob> what?
[05:54:50] <FunkyBob> if you want to re-use t he password reset token stuff for email validation, spend the 20 minutes it will take to see how it's used in the password reset code
[05:57:21] <tm007> FunkyBob:
[05:57:35] <tm007> Do you get the day off for Queen's Birthday?

[06:03:50] <tm007> wallbroken: where's the password reset code?
[06:05:11] <FunkyBob> wait, which view are we debugging here?
[06:06:50] <tm007> email validation?
[06:07:47] <FunkyBob> they keep pasting 4 views at a time
[06:07:53] <FunkyBob> and another with an error
[06:08:00] <FunkyBob> I want to know which one we're debugging
[06:08:03] <FunkyBob> I refuse to guess
[06:08:52] <tm007> wallbroken:
[06:12:02] <wallbroken> the last one
[06:12:24] <wallbroken> this is the view for validating the update of the email address
[06:12:27] <wallbroken> not the reset view.

[06:20:28] <FunkyBob> if it's for validating the token you got, why is it giving a link to that?
[06:21:53] <wallbroken> the logic is: when i try to update the email address from the form, a link is sent to the new email address
[06:22:22] <wallbroken> and once the user open it, the update ends
[06:22:51] <FunkyBob> hrm
[06:23:31] <FunkyBob> how is it going to remember the new email they put in?
[06:25:08] <tm007> why is uidb64 empty?
[06:25:40] <wallbroken> IDK
[06:25:55] <tm007> can't be empty mate
[06:26:04] <wallbroken> GinFuyou was assisting me in building that code
[06:26:33] <dang`r`us> ?P<uidb64>[^/]+ <--  that's "any character except a /, and more than one"
[06:27:04] <tm007> dangerous
[06:27:23] <FunkyBob> it's ok, it's passed to some strict parsing
[06:27:26] <dang`r`us> that's me
[06:27:54] <dang`r`us> FunkyBob, I mean, if uidb64 is empty, that won't fit with "1 or more"
[06:28:04] <dang`r`us> but I'm also tired and might be missing the mark here
[06:28:06] <dang`r`us> I should go to bed
[06:28:37] <tm007> dang`r`us: good night
[06:28:44] <dang`r`us> byeee
[06:30:02] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: can you fix the code please?
[06:30:46] <tm007> wallbroken: looks like you need to pass uid in line 81
[06:33:38] <wallbroken> context must be a dict rather than str.
[06:33:48] <FunkyBob> well, you need to design it first
[06:33:48] <wallbroken>   'token': default_token_generator.make_token(self.object),
[06:33:49] <wallbroken> here
[06:34:02] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: i already told you the design
[06:34:09] <wallbroken> it's very common and simple
[06:34:42] <wallbroken> when an user updates the email address, the new one must be verified in order to avoid any typo and the user is unable to recover the account
[06:34:45] <FunkyBob> but you haven't finished the desisn
[06:34:57] <FunkyBob> because you can't answer where you're storing the new email whilst it's being validated
[06:35:06] <wallbroken> i answered me
[06:35:09] <FunkyBob> or why you're generating a link for validation... in the view that does the validation
[06:35:10] <wallbroken> *you
[06:35:15] <FunkyBob> only answer I saw was "IDK"
[06:35:22] <wallbroken> 3:56:04 AM - wallbroken: GinFuyou was assisting me in building that code
[06:35:25] <wallbroken> this is the answer
[06:35:30] <FunkyBob> well, that doesn't count
[06:35:35] <wallbroken> i explained to him what my goal is
[06:35:35] <FunkyBob> YOU need to complete the design
[06:35:38] <FunkyBob> THEN write the code
[06:35:58] <wallbroken> now the design is complete?
[06:36:14] <wallbroken> i provided all we need to reach the goal?
[06:36:17] <FunkyBob> write down in a dpaste the steps
[06:36:19] <tm007> there's this phenomenon called bus factor
[06:36:19] <FunkyBob> no you didn't
[06:36:26] <FunkyBob>  you still haven't answered how you're solving the problem I posed
[06:36:34] <tm007> you had a bus factor of 1 for your code
[06:36:47] <FunkyBob> more like 0
[06:36:52] <tm007> and unfortunately it was someone else in charge
[06:37:17] <tm007> he's not here and so we're stuck in a deadlock
[06:37:40] <tm007> wallbroken: I'll recommend you read the unicorn project
[06:37:58] <wallbroken> i reccomend myself to go to sleep
[06:38:12] <wallbroken> but i'm trying to reach this goal since many days
[06:38:18] <wallbroken> 1 week maybe
[06:38:30] <tm007> you should mate. All nighters really hinder productivity.

[16:00:42] <moldy> bancroft: handle the js as static files, not as templates
[16:01:14] <moldy> so put it below myapp/static, or in a project-wide static directory if you set STATICFILES_DIRS
[16:01:29] <moldy> alternatively, you can keep it completely outside of django
[16:05:40] <bancroft> moldy: i'm a little unclear on one detail, is the static folder in the same folder as manage.py?
[16:06:12] <moldy> bancroft: often, yes
[16:06:29] <moldy> technically you can put it anywhere you want, you use STATICFILES_DIRS to tell django where it is
[16:06:46] <moldy> make sure it is not the same path as STATIC_ROOT

[16:11:36] <hylje> if you include your static root in your staticfiles dirs your static root will double in size every time you collectstatic because it will collect its content into itself

[16:39:29] <pycode> do you usually store more templates inside the same app? i mean  app/templates/themeA   app/templates/themeB   app/templates/themeC OR do you move those theme inside others app ?
[16:45:13] <moldy> pycode: i'd probably keep them in the same app
[16:45:20] <pycode> can i not have a global templatetags ?
[16:45:32] <pycode> moldy, so multiple layouts/design in the same app
[16:45:41] <pycode> or use the global templates/ static/ folders right ?
[16:45:45] <pycode> but...what about templatestags ?
[16:45:59] <pycode> i mean how can i organize them ?
[16:46:01] <moldy> i see no advantage in splitting things into multiple apps here
[16:46:09] <moldy> unless you want them to be installable independently
[16:46:17] <pycode> no no i can have everything inside the same app but.. the "problem" could be
[16:46:20] <moldy> you're overthinking this
[16:46:26] <pycode> if i have themeA themeB themeC
[16:46:29] <hylje> you can move them around if it causes problems
[16:46:32] <moldy> organize them how it makes sense to you
[16:46:40] <pycode> i can do that because of the folder name...but what about templatetags ?
[16:46:51] <moldy> what's the problem with templatetags?
[16:47:03] <pycode> if themeA has its own tags same for themeB etc
[16:47:14] <pycode> i cannot put them into folder i suppose no?

[18:54:03] <dodo> did i say very bad yet?

[18:54:47] <dodo> i wish i had better English so that i could express in a more poetic way how this is bad :D

[18:57:27] <dodo> outside the db obviously
[18:58:13] <Lauxley> (well it wasn't really deleted it was moved but there some data loss if i try to move it back so i'd rather not)

[18:59:28] <dodo> there are two known states of the database?
[18:59:36] <Lauxley> well no I can't do that either because new instances would have the same issue, and I can't really ask people to deviate from a regular deployment
[19:00:45] <Lauxley> we had a m2m that we moved from one Model to it's parent, now we regret and we want the m2m in both Models, if we move the data back we don't know in which child it was so we can't do that

[19:40:40] <dsluo> can i get someone's opinion real quick? at work, i'm on a project to develop basically a CRUD app with some customizations like version control and spreadsheet upload, but the project lead wants to use django admin to basically do everything.
[19:40:41] <dsluo> i'm not entirely sure if this is a good idea vs just making our own views. I'm worried that doing it this way will just be more difficult and/or harder to maintain and i'm not entirely sure if this was the intended use case for django admin.
[19:41:04] <dsluo> that being said, i haven't messed around with django admin too much

[19:42:54] <hylje> admin is quite flexible but it's not designed like a proper publicly available web app, as it gives you all the power and then you have to reduce it (instead of starting from nothing and having just what you want it to do)
[19:43:19] <GinFuyou> It's not intended use case for admin, no. Whether it's a real problem or not so much depends on details, imo

[19:44:30] <dsluo> well, it's only going to be used to the client's internal admin team, so maybe not? but they specifically wanted to avoid any kind of invalid data in their system, which is the problem they're currently having

[21:59:14] <Dillon> Created it here: https://github.com/django/django/pull/14527
[22:00:00] <knbk> that's not a typo, though. The convention for those kinds if inputs is that the default value is capitalized
[22:00:14] <knbk> so if you just hit enter it will use "No"
[22:00:55] <Dillon> ...
[22:01:01] <Dillon> that seems weird
[22:01:29] <Dillon> from looking at the python code, i saw that it only does something if the user inputs `y` or `Y`
[22:01:29] <hylje> that's how it works
[22:01:50] <Dillon> I'll close the PR then so it doesn't waste a mods time
[22:02:37] <knbk> maybe it is weird and we're just all used to it, but I'm guessing that convention is older than I am :)
[22:03:03] <Dillon> i haven't seen it before, so naturally I just thought it was a typo
[22:03:38] <kenbolton> the convention was long established when i first started dabbling with unix in 1991.

[23:27:54] <zamba> when using CBVs i realize that much of the work is done for me.. when getting POST data and then automatically creating a new object using the CreateView, i don't have every field from the POST, but instead i have something from the URL itself.. how can i manually add that to the object creation?

[23:54:21] <Diplomat> Hey guys! I'm wondering.. is it possible to SUM amount only for distinct transaction ids ?
[23:54:33] <rannnn8888> how i can make this in django ? https://dpaste.org/K27i
[23:55:06] <Diplomat> Something like.. .annotate(total_amount=Sum('amount', filter=Distinct('transaction_id')) :D
[23:56:34] <hylje> Diplomat: case when can probably do it
[23:56:42] <hylje> maybe
