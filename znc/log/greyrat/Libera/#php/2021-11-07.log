[04:07:54] <Blondie101010> never ask to ask!
[04:09:17] <chazy> i want to use a package in my project, i required it using composer but i don't know what else to do, the readme file says to just call the function inside a blade.php file and that's it but for me it's just printing the code instead of the image: https://github.com/agatanga/flags
[04:10:09] <Albright> chazy: What do you mean by "printing the code?"
[04:10:31] <chazy> in the browser i can see "@flag('us')" instead of the flag img
[04:10:32] <Albright> I'm guessing it's outputting the HTML code which would display the image, right?
[04:11:12] <Albright> Ah, it sounds like your template isn't being parsed correctly them. You are using Laravel?
[04:11:17] <chazy> do i need to do something extra after running `composer require agatanga/flags` in the project folder?
[04:11:21] <chazy> yes, i'm using laravel
[04:12:31] <Albright> I haven't used it much myself so I can't help you after that. Perhaps try asking on #lavavel.
[04:12:37] <Albright> *#laravel
[04:13:30] <Albright> If that even exists… maybe they're all using Slack or Discord or something. That sounds like a Laravel thing to do.

[12:08:31] <scara> Can I make a imagepng but encoded as base64? I've tried wraping it inside of base64_encode but it just seens to be bypassed
[12:10:30] <AllenJB> scara: Yes, you can store any data as base64. However whether your target can read that data is a different matter. What are you trying to achieve (What are you outputting the data to? Why do you want to base64 encode it?)
[12:11:25] <AllenJB> And what exactly do you mean by "seems to be bypassed"? (What did you expect to see, where? What did you actually see?)
[12:11:40] <scara> I made an image, I want to display that image so that means makeing it base64 so that it may be within the html and doesn't need multiple files.
[12:12:12] <scara> I expect the image to be base64 encoded but it wasn't.
[12:12:52] <scara> echo "<img src=\"data:image/png;base64,".$image64."\">"; # Would be nice.
[12:14:56] <AllenJB> Can you show us the code you used to create $image64? (Use a pastebin such as gist.github.com).
[12:16:09] <scara> I mean I quite literly said it. I want base64_encode(imagepng($image)); but that doesn't work, it doesn't get base64 encoded, it just displays the raw image instead.
[12:16:43] <scara> I've looked for solutions online, doesn't seem like its possible so thats why I asked here..
[12:19:19] <AllenJB> imagepng returns a boolean, so base64'ing that isn't going to be a valid image. Assuming the image is a file on disk, I'd probably use file_get_contents() to get the image file data.
[12:20:30] <scara> The image isn't on disk, and yes I know it isn't being encoded as base64, thats what I'm asking help for.

[18:44:34] <steve> Calling the child class, which invokes a method from a parent (abstract class) which then invokes an abstract method that gets implemented by the child class again
[18:46:13] <steve> Effectively, having a parent class call a child class's function
[18:47:33] <steve> Oh, apparently I needed late static binding from static:: instead of self::
[18:47:39] <biberu> steve: why are those methods static?

[18:48:42] <steve> biberu: in that example they probably don't need to be - but in my code, they're more like factory methods. So having them be static makes more sense
[18:49:46] <steve> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2859633/why-cant-you-call-abstract-functions-from-abstract-classes-in-php was where I found the answer
[18:58:17] <biberu> steve: careful that the code remains testable etc., and fwiw you can instantiate factories too

[19:54:03] <chazy> hi, i have a weird case where a svg image does not render correctly (missing parts) when it's included in php, but if i open the same svg code in the browser it shows perfectly fine
[19:54:24] <chazy> any idea what could be the problem?
[19:55:06] <AllenJB> What exactly does "included with PHP" mean in this context? Can you show us the code (use a pastebin such as gist.github.com)
[19:55:09] <biberu> chazy: what do you mean by included?
[19:55:28] <chazy> the <svg> element i put it in a template file

[19:56:41] <chazy> i have the website online in goalstadium.com/partner
[19:57:25] <biberu> are you talking about php.net/include? why are you including svg?
[19:57:37] <AllenJB> If you're using include/require/exec to process that template, you'll want to ensure that short_open_tag ini setting is disabled - The short open tag (<?) will interfere with XMLs <?xml tags
[19:58:06] <chazy> i meant that i included the <svg> element inside a php template
[19:58:28] <biberu> can you show us an example?
[19:59:01] <chazy> yes, you can see the rendered template in https://www.goalstadium.com/partner
[19:59:29] <chazy> the venezuela flag it's missing the stars
[19:59:52] <chazy> but if you copy the svg code and open it in the browser directly it shows the flag fine
[20:02:59] <chazy> since it looks like the svg code is fine, it's probably a browser/css issue?
[20:03:49] *** Quits: guido (~guido@host-80-116-25-37.retail.telecomitalia.it) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[20:07:10] <biberu> chazy: the stars are done as references to other elements, like this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/use
[20:08:27] <biberu> chazy: guessing it's just picking up ids from other parts of your page
[20:08:50] <chazy> should that appear in the code inspector?
[20:09:00] <biberu> it does
[20:10:03] <steve> So I'm using Carbon date objects to represent dates of birth. The problem is that I don't always have a complete DOB - somoetimes it's just Year or Year and Month...
[20:10:30] <steve> The problem is that Carbon doesn't allow 00 as either month or day (I understand why)
[20:10:38] <steve> So I end up defaulting to 01
[20:10:43] <biberu> you could test that theory by e.g. creating unique ids (instead of a, b, c...) and reloading it, if that's the issue you'll need to either include it separately, or figure out some way of restructuring it to isolate it from the rest of the tree
[20:11:03] <steve> But then that implies that the person's DOB is Jan 1st when it's not. It's just "unknown month/date"
[20:11:31] <steve> So on a philosophical level... how should I represent these partial dates?
[20:12:41] <AllenJB> steve: Carbon, as far as I've seen, isn't designed to handle incomplete date/time values. If you want to represent and work with them without making an assumption like replacing unknown values with "01", I think you'd have to create your own value object.
[20:13:25] <steve> Hmm
[20:14:20] <steve> And since this is going to be in an API which other people will be consuming, I have to wonder whether it's a good idea to give them incomplete dates at all... I have no idea how their date parsers would react to something like: 1975-00-00 or 1980-XX-XX

[20:14:39] <steve> An ugly problem to have, I suppose
[20:14:50] <Rockwood> wht?
[20:15:18] <steve> You know I could solve this if everyone in the country would just give me their full DOBs. Then I wouldn't have bad data.
[20:15:40] <steve> ANd while they're at it, a full SSN would be handy also.
[20:16:03] <steve> And so that it's easy to dig through the database, I'll store it in plain text
[20:16:06] <AllenJB> Why are you passing around DoBs through APIs?
[20:16:23] <biberu> chazy: note that including it directly in the page like that will prevent the browser from caching it separately, and might also cause it to be downloaded several times per view, costing bandwidth for both your site and the end user
[20:16:32] <AllenJB> You could always make clear in the documentation that the value may be partial.
[20:16:40] <steve> AllenJB: it's for identity verification
[20:20:08] <biberu> steve: how does that verify anything?
[20:20:34] <steve> That's up to the consumer of the data
[20:20:42] <Rockwood> good night
[20:21:00] <biberu> mm Rockwood
[20:21:09] <biberu> nn*
[20:21:22] <chazy> biberu: you mean i should use an img tag so it can be cached?
[20:21:59] <steve> They send my API some PII (usually ssn, name+dob, or dl number), I reach out to the credit bureau, grab the person's complete info (DOB included), return it to the customer
[20:22:00] <biberu> chazy: for example, you could also use css to use it as a background on some element that represents the flag in the dom
[20:22:12] <steve> How they intpret the data my API returns is out of my jurisdiction
[20:22:27] <steve> I just can't be giving them partial DOBs without making sure they understand it's partial.
[20:22:34] <Rockwood> lol
[20:22:39] <Rockwood> gn
[20:22:42] <steve> So I'm thinking a date object with separate/nullable day/monty/year fields
[20:22:43] <Rockwood> cya
[20:23:34] <steve> So they can get back {"year": 1975, "month": null; "day": null} instead of "1975-01-01" because those imply something pretty different
