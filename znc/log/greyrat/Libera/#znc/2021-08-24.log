[00:27:16] <Khaytsus> I offhand don't, and annoyingly znc then also saves that new channel to be joined..  so gotta make sure to part it

[00:32:15] <Casper> Stick any chan you -must- join, and it'll keep on trying and trying AND TRYING and so on and so forth.
[00:34:32] <MetaNova> alternatively, putting explicit 'join #chan1,#chan2,#chan3' into [[Perform]] would at least make it attempt to join those _specific_ channels when it connects to the network

[00:35:27] <Casper> MetaNova, but as they say, if you get forced into an overflow channel, it won't retry :p
[00:35:52] <MetaNova> correct. the perform option is merely a way to ensure it tries to join the desired channels at least once
[00:35:58] <Exa> thanks, I'll give it a try and see if some overflow appear on the next netsplit or server reboot

[00:47:48] <Strykar> in the nickserv module, how do I see what is being sent by znc to auth? we swapped ircds from charybdis to ergo and now it appears to not send "/msg nickserv identify nick pass"
[00:48:18] <Strykar> or more likely, it's sending "/msg nickserv identify pass" :/
[00:49:27] <Casper> Then just do /znc *nickserv set nick pass
[00:49:40] <Strykar> I dont remember the pass :(
[00:49:54] <Casper> Reset it... :P
[00:50:31] <Strykar> sadly that would require working email which the box does not have atm
[00:50:57] <Casper> Get that working..... >:D
[00:51:31] <Strykar> so "/znc *nickserv ViewCommands" shows "IDENTIFY NICKSERV IDENTIFY {password}" which I'm unsure how to interpret
[00:51:49] <Casper> Yeah, it will do: /nickserv identify <password>
[00:52:02] <Casper> Which will be what you did with "set <thisStringHere>"
[00:52:11] <DoctorD90> instead of nickserv go with sasl (ok im certificate addicted, you are rigth, it is a drug xD)
[00:52:13] <Strykar> and I can't change that with set unless I know the pass
[00:52:46] <Casper> Eh, I think you could do: /znc *nickserv setcommand IDENTIFY NICKSERV IDENTIFY MyNickName {password} if you must.
[00:56:44] <Strykar> Casper: thanks, that worked to fix the string being sent, sadly it still says "Password incorrect". This db was imported using the provided script from the previous atheme install, I wonder if that borked things
[01:05:52] <Strykar> also why is the command shown as "IDENTIFY NICKSERV IDENTIFY Strykar {password}"? shouldn't it be "IDENTIFY NICKSERV Strykar {password}" for "/msg NICKSERV IDENTIFY Strykar passwd"?

[15:20:38] <DoctorD90> hi bookworm, yes i did. As stated also in the page you link (thanks, I havent to google something else:) 'cloak helps limit the exposure of your IP address'. The intent to add the cloak section is to push people to use it. As you can see before, in the guide, the SASL support is actived, so as reported in the page you linked: "Workaround: Use only the SASL authentication method". That's not to discuss on illegal topic (not the intent of Hardening 
[15:20:38] <DoctorD90> guide). The intent is to hide the IP :) yes, there are even better solutions as Tor, but this would require discussing on how to isntall tor aand whatever. Using SASL you will be connected already authenticated and there will be no issue :) I never stated that it is to anonimize. 
[15:21:37] <DoctorD90> if people take only little pieces of the guide, it is up to them. From my point of view there are no misleading information on it :) feel free to implement the Tor side if you want
