[04:18:14] <berndj> i was reading another doc just now that casually dropped a claim that any shape can have "conjugate action" (constant angular velocity ratio), you just have to adapt the second "gear" to conform to the first to ensure conjugacy
[04:21:32] <int-e> berndj: I don't know; I imagine there are some severe restrictions on the shapes still. If I understand correctly, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloid_gear generalizes involute gears...
[04:21:59] <berndj> int-e, yes, your colour-annotated diagram helps; forgetting about where the contact point actually is for the moment, i'm now convinced that the intersection between the gear tooth flank and the line of action travels at constant speed
[04:22:02] <int-e> One nice thing about the involute gears is that the transmission force is vertical to the gear surface where they touch.
[04:22:44] <berndj> in one of those articles i gathered that the major nice thing is that the shape doesn't depend on the other gear
[04:23:13] <int-e> Oh that's also a good point.

[04:27:30] <int-e> berndj: Yeah, you're right, it'll always be vertical. Maybe it's really all about having standardized shapes. I don't know, I've never thought much about gears tbh.

[06:09:23] <johnkeats6> Fangs, it is a useful fact that just complex differentiable (without assuming *any* regularity on the derivative) already implies the cauchy formula and thus analyticity (?). however, it takes some work to prove, and it obscures how simple the essence of the subject is
[06:09:56] <johnkeats6> if you define holomorphic as complex differentiable + C^2, the whole ordeal basically falls out of stokes's theorem in 1 line
[06:10:28] <Fangs> johnkeats6: im fine with imposing extra conditions on complex differentiable definition if that means the proof is easier, I think

[06:11:51] <johnkeats6> complex diff means df/dzbar = 0. note d(f dz) = df/dz dz /\ dz + df/dzbar dzbar /\ dz = 0. hence if a curve C bounds a compact region, you apply stokes and you get int_C f dz = int_region d(f dz) = 0
[06:12:11] <johnkeats6> C^1 is enough actually - you just need stokes's theorem to work
[06:12:19] <Fangs> I thought so

[06:13:49] <johnkeats6> anyway so that easily gives you what they call goursat's theorem (that integrating a holomorphic fn over a curve that bounds a region with no singularities of the fn inside gives you 0)
[06:14:33] <johnkeats6> and then cauchy's formula becomes an easy computation, because if the only singularity is at z_0, stokes says you can replace any contour (that goes around only once) by a very small circle around z_0

[06:15:18] <johnkeats6> for a very small circle you use the first order approximation for f and it just works out in 1 line
[06:16:05] <johnkeats6> the only problem is the whole argument collapses if you hadn't assumed C^1. and there are some cases where you don't wanna assume that. i think that reflection theorem is one of them
[06:16:39] <johnkeats6> sometimes you define a fn by an explicit formula and you can check the derivative exists by looking at the limit definition, but who the hell knows about C^1. so it's useful to know you don't need to assume it
[06:16:49] <Fangs> johnkeats6: how extensive does that book use (singular) homology?
[06:16:54] <johnkeats6> but it's probably not terrible to just believe it & skip the proof
[06:17:13] <Fangs> it seems that they only use it so they can invoke stoke's essentially, and invariance of integrals along homology classes
[06:17:25] <johnkeats6> yeah it's nothing advanced

[06:48:41] <Fangs> I read what was said, noticed the mistake in what I wrote
[06:52:30] <Fangs> ok so when proving goursat's theorem, you start with a triangle, you subdivide it into 4, stein shrikachi just says "there must be a subtriangle such that |\int_big triangle f(z) dz| <= 4|\int_small triangle f(z) dz|
[06:52:58] <Fangs> do you lose anything if you just choose (from the four triangle) whose |integral| is maximal?
[06:53:36] <frelleck> no you can chosoe any triangle that works

[11:56:21] <Fangs> joel135: how many edges are there in a complete graph? n!?
[11:57:55] <W> joel135, that's a complex problem that's not really amenable to solving on IRC, but if you want some thoughts on how to approach it I'd look at the set of all graphs with N nodes, which graphs can be formed by adding an edge at a time and stopping when there's such a path (intuition says when the strength of the graph with a and b in different partitions is 1), and the distribution of the number of edges
[11:57:58] <riv> evil question!
[11:58:36] <riv> random graphs
[11:59:28] <W> but even that initial thought from me is too simple, as you need to also account for how /many/ of the edges being removed would disconnect it
[12:00:04] <W> basically, for any kind of serious size, I'd just Monte Carlo it and call it a day
[12:00:53] <W> (For smaller, brute force it. Both with a computer.)

[13:29:12] <Hi-Angel1> Given some algebraic structures A and B both with a binary operation *, can anybody imagine a function Æ’: A â†’ B that *does not* satisfy the homomorphism axiom `Æ’(x*y) = Æ’(x) * Æ’(y)`? I was thinking about it, and I couldn't see what's the point of this axiom. "It preserves some structure" â€” well, maybe a littleâ€¦ As long as domain and codomain of Æ’ are closed under their binary operation *, this axiom would be
[13:29:14] <Hi-Angel1> satisfied for all imaginable Æ’, wouldn't it?

[16:25:33] <Franciman> hi
[16:25:34] <Z-module> You'll be glad to know that I know promote the use of the terms "June solstice" and "December solstice", instead of summer/winter
[16:26:16] <Franciman> today I got blasted by the teacher
[16:26:21] <Franciman> they said my proof was not correct
[16:26:24] <Franciman> but it is correct
[16:26:29] <Franciman> I copied from the Bosch
[16:26:30] <Z-module> Proof of what?
[16:26:38] <Franciman> hilbert's basis theorem
[16:26:56] <Franciman> Mathematicians, especially bourbakian ones, are really strange beasts, no offense
[16:27:00] <Z-module> R commutative noetherian -> R[x] also noetherian?
[16:27:01] <Franciman> but what the heck
[16:27:05] <Franciman> Z-module: yes
[16:27:27] <Z-module> Did you carefully check for typos in your copy?
[16:27:33] <Franciman> Z-module: it is correct
[16:27:35] <Z-module> just a single wrong variable name can invalidate it
[16:27:42] <Franciman> he said that my ascending chain
[16:27:44] <Franciman> was not finite
[16:27:48] <Franciman> which is the damn definition of noetherian
[16:27:53] <Franciman> well
[16:27:55] <Franciman> sorry
[16:27:57] <Franciman> I mean
[16:28:03] <Z-module> We could look at your proof, if you like
[16:28:05] <Franciman> it becomes stable after finitely many steps
[16:28:28] <Franciman> it is at page...
[16:28:30] <Franciman> wait
[16:28:53] <Franciman> I do a pic
[16:28:56] <Z-module> (conceivably the one in Bosch is flawed/wrong...)
[16:29:10] <Z-module> (printed math books aren't perfect, sadly)
[16:29:15] <Franciman> no, I think he misunderstood what I was saying, because he could not look at what I was writing
[16:29:21] <Franciman> and he said: this is not how we proved it
[16:29:30] <Franciman> i said, I know, but I like this proof better
[16:30:06] <Franciman> Z-module: https://a.uguu.se/mENvRoGA.png
[16:30:34] <Franciman> I suppose that he did not understand that my succession a_i of ideals of R is an ascending chain
[16:30:38] <Franciman> but I explicitly proved that
[16:30:41] <Z-module> yeah, once on an exam, when asked to show that every field has an algebraic closure, I bucked the universal standard and instead wrote out a correct proof by transfinite induction.
[16:30:44] <Franciman> a_i \subsetof a_{i+1}
[16:30:49] <Z-module> (but they did accept it)
[16:30:56] <Franciman> maybe he got confused
[16:31:07] <Franciman> since later I forgot to say that the succession was ascending
[16:31:15] <Z-module> (by the way, the macro is just called \subset )
[16:31:15] <Franciman> so he said: you don't know it stabilizes!
[16:31:17] <Franciman> i said I do know
[16:31:24] <Franciman> Z-module: thanks, but I use my own latex
[16:31:28] <Z-module> okay
[16:31:31] <Franciman> so i make a lot of mistakes ahha
[16:31:32] <Franciman> thanks
[16:31:40] <Franciman> i will try to do \subset from now on
[16:32:02] <rubiksdream> this just looks like noethers proof
[16:32:48] <rubiksdream> her idea was to consider the ideal of leading coefficients of the ideal in R[Y]
[16:32:55] <rubiksdream> and from then on its somewhat straightforward
[16:33:12] <Franciman> he said that I first have to consider the ideal of all leading coefficients
[16:33:17] <Franciman> then it is finitely generated
[16:33:36] <rubiksdream> yeah
[16:33:43] <rubiksdream> oh so that's not exactly what you are doing
[16:33:43] <Franciman> so I consider the polynomials with the greatest degree that have those leading coefficients
[16:34:07] <Franciman> [here I am dubious, I suppose he means, find a polynomial for each generator and get the maximum of their degrees]

[16:34:13] <Franciman> then he says, I can be sure things are finitely generated
[16:34:15] <Franciman> and I say ok
[16:34:28] <Franciman> well he just didn't want to pay attention to me
[16:34:37] <Franciman> because I said, let me do the proof and correct the error
[16:34:48] <Franciman> he said, no you are wrong
[16:34:50] <Franciman> lol
[16:35:14] <Franciman> what I hate the most about those geometers is that they say things are equal
[16:35:18] <Franciman> when that is not the damn thing
[16:35:22] <Franciman> they are isomorphic

[16:38:29] <rubiksdream> i think your proof works
[16:39:20] <Franciman> what I am supposing here is that I didn't explicitly say ascending chain of ideals
[16:39:24] <Franciman> so he said, you are dumb sar
[16:39:28] <Franciman> that's my only takeaway
[16:39:36] <Franciman> well, it does not matter
[16:39:50] <rubiksdream> he probably did not understand what a_i is supposed to be
[16:39:51] <Franciman> I also think the proof is okay
[16:39:59] <rubiksdream> he most likely thought it was an ideal in R[Y], not R
[16:40:04] <Franciman> no he understood it, but he said that I could not know what the generators were
[16:40:07] <Franciman> i don't know of what
[16:40:16] <Franciman> I said, I know they are all finitely generated
[16:40:22] <Franciman> so he said: well but there are infinite of them
[16:40:26] <Franciman> and I said, but R is noetherian
[16:40:35] <Franciman> the succession at some point gets stuck
[16:40:38] <Franciman> he said, you can't know it
[16:40:39] <Franciman> .-.
[16:41:07] <Franciman> so what's wrong here is that I didn't say the ascending chain stabilizes

[22:10:02] <int-e> "direct proof" usually means avoiding proof by contraposition or contradiction, so proof by induction is included
[22:11:14] <mawk> hmm
[22:11:20] <mawk> that's not what I call direct proof
[22:11:25] <mawk> I mean I don't include induction
[22:11:30] <mawk> but I'm not a pro maths guy
[22:11:52] <int-e> I may be wrong.
[22:11:55] <mawk> it's a colloquial term anyway, "constructive proof" is maybe a more interesting distinction
[22:13:11] <int-e> I probably wouldn't use "direct proof" to describe a proof by induction, since "proof by induction" is more specific anyway.
[22:13:17] <mawk> yeah
[22:13:21] <cherim> If you go down to Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms, you'll probably discover that essentially every proof which deals with more than a finite set of objects uses induction
[22:13:47] <bosspotato> it's not terminology any working mathematician has ever used in his daily life anyway eh
[22:14:31] <int-e> "Proof: Obvious. \qed" ;-)
[22:14:42] <cherim> So induction is a first-class citizen
[22:15:03] <cherim> If you think you avoided it, you are usually tricking yourself

[22:16:26] <cherim> Maybe one can create a hierarchy of proofs at very high level (i.e. where you prove divisibility of poynomial expressions either with going over residue classes or by induction and factoring)
[22:16:46] <cherim> But this doesn't make sense as a well-posed math statement
[22:17:16] <int-e> I guess what happens is that if you ask me to give "direct proof" a mathematical meaning, I interpret it as "intuitionistic proof". And that includes induction.
[22:17:43] <jennifer> Well that's what I'm trying to figure out
[22:18:00] <jennifer> I'm using proof by induction a lot but wondering if every proof that has a direct proof, can also be done by proof by induction
[22:18:06] <int-e> Other people may do different substitutions.
[22:18:09] <jennifer> I'm asking because of several reasons, I don't know if proof by induction is its own category
[22:18:17] <johnkeats6> a direct proof is when you just go for it, rather than beating around the bush
[22:18:29] <int-e> jennifer: If you have a propositional statement, inductions just doesn't come up.
[22:18:53] <bosspotato> yeah to my ears a direct proof is a proof that's not very involved and just gets there directly
[22:19:15] <int-e> bosspotato: It could involve a length computation though? It's so vague...
[22:19:32] <jennifer> int-e, what do you mean?
[22:19:37] <bosspotato> sure, it's informal
[22:20:24] <bosspotato> pretty much in the same category as easy proof or elementary proof in my eyes
[22:21:20] <bosspotato> but yeah, jennifer, the problem ends up being that we don't know what you mean by direct proof
[22:21:39] <johnkeats6> proofs are proofs, there's no point in discriminating them
[22:22:14] <cherim> For a mathematician a direct proof is usually the one which doesn't use excluded middle, usually intuitionistic as int-e said
[22:22:27] <jennifer> I mean, direct proof is pretty standard: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_proof
[22:22:31] <jennifer> p -> q
[22:22:32] <cherim> And I only add that induction should certainly be considered direct
[22:23:20] <jennifer> There are a bunch of indirect proofs, like proof by contradiction, proof by contrapositive
[22:23:32] <cherim> That's the excluded middle thing
[22:23:39] <jennifer> But there doesn't seem to be a lot of direct proof, other than another known name, proof by construction
[22:30:25] <johnkeats6> contrapositive is logically equivalent so i hardly see how can there be a meaningful distinction
[22:31:48] <int-e> johnkeats6: contrapositive is strictly weaker; it gives you fewer assumptions to work with.
[22:33:02] <int-e> In the sense that any proof by contrapositive is also a proof by contradiction except for one extra final step that produces the contradiction.
[22:33:36] <int-e> While taking a proof by contradiction and turning it into a proof by contraposition may require some serious restructuring
[22:34:27] <bosspotato> sounds smart
[22:35:17] <int-e> Still informal though; formally, to prove A -> B you prove ~B -> ~A, and if you prove ~B using negation introduction that means you assume ~B and A and derive a contradiction.
[22:35:47] <int-e> So... it's mostly a matter of perception.

[23:38:54] <berndj> proof of the contrapositive was my favourite trick in undergrad math. it caught the lecturer's attention. said he noticed i did my proofs "differently than the usual", but that he didn't mind, he just found it interesting
[23:39:43] <berndj> i usually couldn't at all see any A -> B route, but ~B -> ~A proofs just leapt out at me
