[02:46:14] <biys> audrey: i'd say it's all in what we've seen as we've progressed.  there's also some biological aspects to it i assume as well.  i don't think i'd necessarily understand or find attractive someone who was too far outside my normal comprehension.  it would likely have to be relative to some idea that's been formulated in my mind at some point prior.
[02:46:37] <biys> so, lets just say, i (because i'm alt right) have a fetish for asians
[02:46:42] <biys> (which tends to be suggested)
[02:46:55] <biys> https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/opinion/sunday/alt-right-asian-fetish.html
[02:46:55] <ro-bot-o> [url] nytimes.com | www.nytimes.com
[02:47:12] <biys> is that, do you think, because of sailor moon?  or sailor jupiter?
[02:47:13] <biys> HAH
[02:48:23] <biys> cause, lets say that a person never "grew up" with any kind of realization that they could be more/have more than their deadbeat parents?
[02:48:35] <biys> i think that their understanding of the world would be associated with that information only
[02:48:56] <biys> their "prospects" wouldn't be as high as someone who's more "exposure" lets say
[02:50:08] <biys> i think it's also associated with the idea of the sins of the father
[02:50:17] <biys> and how we're set to re-live the shortcomings of our parents
[02:50:35] <biys> because...  they are our role models
[02:50:42] <biys> we'd base our understanding of the world on what they've taught us
[02:53:45] <biys> but i only read the first part of the article
[02:53:59] <biys> it's a long one, i'll have to go back to it after i watch all i've started already

[15:22:08] <arryana> that's the one, thanks, pussipupu
[15:25:09] <Delf> Actually, I take that back. Being altruistic seems to be about something else than what I had initially thought it to be about
[15:26:09] <inhahe_> being altruistic is simply about love, compassion, empathy, caring
[15:26:18] <inhahe_> it's a natural part of being alive
[15:27:26] <Delf> I seems rather shallow
[15:27:49] <Delf> s/I/It/
[15:27:49] <ro-bot-o> Delf meant to say: It seems rather shallow
[15:28:09] <inhahe_> i think people like to rationalize it away as being selfish
[15:28:23] <inhahe_> it makes them feel clever
[15:28:47] <inhahe_> and eliminates the  call to better themselves
[15:28:47] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[15:29:02] <I_Am_M00t> redefine "altruism" as selfishness
[15:29:08] <I_Am_M00t> it's a cheap trick
[15:29:27] <I_Am_M00t> "i read Dawkins, he said everyone was selfish"
[15:29:31] <inhahe_> delf, i tihnk true altruism is beautiful
[15:29:38] <Delf> It seems to tap into the human behavior to organize itself, to fall in line
[15:30:06] <Delf> Our ability and need to conform
[15:30:12] <inhahe_> falling in line in this society is being a selfish capitalist pig

[15:31:01] <Delf> I love pigs...
[15:31:20] <I_Am_M00t> i had a friend who made the "everything people do is selfish" claim
[15:31:42] <I_Am_M00t> i think it's something depressed people like to say
[15:31:45] <Delf> They failed to survive you?
[15:32:00] <I_Am_M00t> there's no reasoning behind it, it's just an emotional statement
[15:32:23] <Delf> Probably defense reaction to something they fail to understand. A behavior they recognize as threatening to their own value
[15:32:38] <I_Am_M00t> i don't know
[15:33:21] <I_Am_M00t> it's a logical fallacy of sorts i think
[15:34:28] <Delf> You could make the claim that one is being selfish when they're copying the behaviour of that of an altuiristic person without themselves having the values that're in accordance with the caring for others
[15:34:57] <I_Am_M00t> ok, well... what if in practice they still help others materially, while losing out materially?
[15:35:01] <inhahe_> they reason that you do good things for others because it makes you feel good for doing them, or you wouldn't do them. but i think that's wrong. genuine sacrifice exists, and the loss you incur from altruism could be greater than the good you feel, and also, the very fact that it's your nature to feel good when you do others good itself is a sign of love
[15:35:51] <I_Am_M00t> isn't altruism and similar defined as making choices that reduce your material and social resources, and increase that of others?
[15:36:17] <inhahe_> i don't know how it's defined. i think it's supposed to be virtuous.
[15:36:34] <I_Am_M00t> yes but, it seems to revolve around giving others resources you have
[15:36:36] <inhahe_> i guess reducing your m aterial and social resources and increasing another's isn't *necessarily* virtous
[15:36:37] *** Joins: KvL (~KvL@user/KvL)
[15:36:44] <inhahe_> yes
[15:37:03] <inhahe_> but i think its being a virtue is an important part
[15:37:15] <I_Am_M00t> i don't know, i think it's overstated
[15:37:30] <Delf> If I'm giving in excess with one hand, and taking by the love of greed with the other hand. Would that make me altuiristic?
[15:37:45] <inhahe_> no
[15:37:50] <I_Am_M00t> it's important, but people take it too far, forgetting the material part, and then use strange logic to argue that altruism isn't altruism
[15:37:55] <inhahe_> well maybe you could be both altruistic and greedy
[15:38:06] <inhahe_> it depends on whether your giving is for the sake of taking
[15:38:08] <inhahe_> or independent of it
[15:38:24] <mycroftiv> I had a friend who said that 'trying to help people' was usually about fulfilling an inner psychological need or appearing virtuous more than genuine caring. I think hes wrong, but even so, an action that causes good results is still a good action.
[15:38:37] <I_Am_M00t> yes mycroftiv , that's what i mean
[15:39:00] <I_Am_M00t> and because "trying to help people" fulfills your inner psychological need, you are actually being selfish. That's how the argument goes
[15:39:14] <I_Am_M00t> I think it's a flawed understanding of what helping people actually is
[15:39:29] <inhahe_>  you can't selfishly help people?
[15:40:49] <I_Am_M00t> if a multimillionaire gave away 99% of his wealth to some cause, and expected nothing back in return, just because this made him happy... i would still call it an altruistic act
[15:41:04] <I_Am_M00t> him feeling happy over it doesn't diminish the altruism
[15:41:21] <Delf> I_Am_M00t: They do that all the time. It's called WEAPONS OF WAR.
[15:41:22] <inhahe_> i agree
[15:41:53] <inhahe_> but i don't think altruism is as simple as helping people
[15:42:00] <I_Am_M00t> yeah, sure
[15:42:10] <arryana> it's hard to say what helping people really is, often.  what people think they need isn't always what they really need.
[15:42:22] <inhahe_> altruism is a state of being as well as the act it engenders
[15:42:27] <I_Am_M00t> but point being, just because you gain psychologically, doesn't mean you were "selfish"
[15:42:35] <I_Am_M00t> that's a skewed definition of selfishness
[15:42:44] * arryana googles altruism for a meaningful definition
[15:43:00] <inhahe_> yeah, that's why i said earlier, "the very fact that it's your nature to feel good when you do others good itself is a sign of love"
[15:43:02] <Delf> Of course, you can consider it to be consequence of human nature rather than the actual motivation
[15:43:18] <arryana> disinterested and selfless.  i like that.
[15:43:19] <inhahe_> delf: those two things aren't mutually exclusive
[15:44:02] <Delf> Indeed
[15:44:20] <Delf> But one part of it is used as an argument to say that it's selfish
[15:44:21] <arryana> helping people for selfish reasons might be useful to the people helped, but i imagine it'd be fairly poisonous for the giver.
[15:46:11] <I_Am_M00t> anyway, a lot of weird definitions are used for these terms, and people come up with strange conclusions
[15:47:10] <I_Am_M00t> thinking of "altruism" or "selfless acts" in terms of material goods at least helps weed out the insane conclusions
[15:47:40] <Delf> The behavior can be copied. The behavior does not need to inherit the definitions of what being altruistic is

[15:52:57] <inhahe_> they're cynical

[15:53:10] <I_Am_M00t> the action overrides his thought
[15:53:15] <inhahe_> but the intention/motivation/attitude counts
[15:53:26] <inhahe_> altruism isn't just about helping per se
[15:53:35] <I_Am_M00t> but what if the only interaction between the guy and the people is the money transfer?
[15:53:41] <I_Am_M00t> what difference does it make at that point?
[15:53:55] <inhahe_> the difference is inside him
[15:54:19] <I_Am_M00t> i don't know, I think he fools himself that he's trolling others
[15:54:24] <Delf> Suppose you think I'm an assholes, and I'll be an assholes by going; "I'll fuck you up from within, by being good hearted enough for you to not be able to deny it".
[15:54:24] <I_Am_M00t> in reality he's helping others
[15:54:32] <inhahe_> i don't disagree with that
[15:54:43] <I_Am_M00t> his view contradicts his own behavior, and also his deeper belief
[15:54:49] <inhahe_> sure

[15:55:11] <I_Am_M00t> it doesn't matter if he meant to troll others, once he gave them money, his thoughts are changed
[15:55:25] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: so he became good-hearted?
[15:55:32] <I_Am_M00t> i don't know
[15:55:37] <inhahe_> not necessarily
[15:55:54] <I_Am_M00t> the point is, maybe altruism isn't all about what happens in some deeper internal state
[15:56:10] <I_Am_M00t> some external actions change your internal state
[15:56:11] <Delf> So it's just the external behavior that matters?
[15:56:11] <inhahe_> if it's not, then why do cynics deny it exists?
[15:56:33] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: but it's not a necessity that they will
[15:56:36] <I_Am_M00t> well i don't know if I'd go that far Delf, I'm just saying that in some cases external actions can override intentions
[15:57:10] <arryana> huh
[15:57:27] <Delf> So... out of fear, I don't retaliate and I come to imagine myself maybe I'm not the assholes I thought I was? There's some good in me still?
[15:58:00] <I_Am_M00t> you specifically? nah ;)

[15:58:39] <I_Am_M00t> all i
[15:58:54] <I_Am_M00t> maybe some actions are impossible to perform without them changing your internal state
[15:59:15] <Delf> Honesty with myself is more important than the external navigation capabilities, hence I value honesty and not truth
[15:59:34] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: you're rationalizing
[15:59:45] <I_Am_M00t> i don't know, am i?
[15:59:52] <I_Am_M00t> i just don't think everything is about intention
[16:00:07] <I_Am_M00t> some things are kind of material
[16:00:15] <inhahe_> not everything is, but i'd say altruism is one of those things that is
[16:00:22] <I_Am_M00t> i don't really think so
[16:00:24] <Delf> Or at least should be
[16:00:39] <Delf> If it's to be what it's supposed to be
[16:02:22] <I_Am_M00t> what if someone goes "i wanna feel good, imma work for 100 hours for free for some cause"
[16:02:40] <I_Am_M00t> that's fine in my book
[16:03:09] <arryana> i think it's very rare that any two people do anything for entirely the same reasons
[16:03:15] <Delf> I like your book. It's a work in progress
[16:03:19] <arryana> i doubt it invalidates the actions often, though
[16:03:30] <I_Am_M00t> i mean, if altruism is not part of that example, then i don't think i care that much about altruism

[16:04:33] <I_Am_M00t> the millionaire feels good when he trolls
[16:05:25] <I_Am_M00t> i think people overthink these terms, i think they're quite mundane
[16:05:26] <inhahe_> trolling is negative
[16:05:29] <inhahe_> altruism isn't negative
[16:05:49] <Delf> Even friendly trolling?
[16:05:53] <I_Am_M00t> ^
[16:06:26] <inhahe_> okay friendly trolling isn't negative ;D
[16:06:35] <brigand> do you think there's a 100% egotistical person?
[16:06:46] <Delf> Good, because I enjoy it :)
[16:06:56] <Delf> Yes, I'm it!
[16:07:31] <inhahe_> i have to look up egotistical
[16:07:45] <Delf> egotestical :P
[16:07:51] <inhahe_> but off hand it doesnt seem like something that's meaningful to put on a scale of minimum to maximum
[16:08:03] <I_Am_M00t> if a millionaire likes to mess with people in need by giving them money, I'll say that's altruism
[16:08:23] <I_Am_M00t> his intention doesn't matter at all, because he can't properly evaluate what he's doing
[16:08:47] <inhahe_> well i don't think that's germane to the spirit of altruism
[16:08:55] <I_Am_M00t> he misunderstands his own action, believing it's negative, when it's not
[16:08:57] <Delf> Your book needs a little work
[16:08:58] <brigand> oh, i meant egoistical
[16:09:09] <I_Am_M00t> nah i think i'm on to something

[16:09:32] <arryana> haha
[16:09:36] <inhahe_> brigand i think everyone has bouts of love/expressing love at least now and then
[16:09:38] <I_Am_M00t> you can't "decide" your true intention, your actions alter your intention
[16:09:48] * Delf knocks Lumine's coffee off
[16:10:02] <Lumine> :(
[16:10:10] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: but that's incidental, that logic still admits that altruism is related to intention
[16:10:21] <I_Am_M00t> i think it's more than that
[16:10:40] <inhahe_> ?
[16:10:57] <Delf> Can you elaborate a little more on that, I_Am_M00t. This could be of paramount importance to me. I cannot decide my true intentions?
[16:10:59] <I_Am_M00t> it suggests that intention isn't entirely up to you, but that the action shapes it
[16:11:23] <I_Am_M00t> it makes the whole idea of intention strange
[16:11:32] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: but if altruism isn't relevant to intention, as you claim, then why does it matter whether your action shapes your intention?
[16:11:38] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: and i think you're reaching
[16:11:55] <Delf> It's a core fundamental to the way I operate. I will break down and will have to rebuild new foundation
[16:12:10] <I_Am_M00t> no, i'm saying that if intention is relevant, then action shapes intention
[16:12:35] <I_Am_M00t> i thin there's something to this
[16:12:42] <I_Am_M00t> actions themselves matter
[16:12:51] <I_Am_M00t> it's not all mental stuff
[16:13:06] <Delf> If there is I'll go through a rebirth and it's been long time since I had one
[16:13:10] <arryana> agreed, moot
[16:13:47] <Delf> How does actions shape intention?
[16:14:31] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: i don't think that, if a person goes into a positive action with negative intentions, the positive action will necessarily reshape his intention to a positive one
[16:14:44] <inhahe_> that doesn't seem remotely realistic to me
[16:14:54] <inhahe_>  i mean, it could happen
[16:15:02] <Delf> Possible but not guaranteed
[16:15:03] <inhahe_> but it's not a necessary happening
[16:15:04] <I_Am_M00t> well i think there is a phenomena like that
[16:15:15] <inhahe_> maybe, but it's not a necessity
[16:15:16] <I_Am_M00t> some actions are simply linked to certain "mental states"

[16:18:37] <I_Am_M00t> it is possible to "scheme", or to intentionally do something that appears as good, to gain something, and in the next step kind of undo the good

[16:20:24] <Delf> I don't know about you but if my intentions become so volatile, I become a danger to others and myself
[16:21:00] <I_Am_M00t> let's say the millionaire gives the people healthcare money, just to blow up the hospital later
[16:21:19] <I_Am_M00t> it's different from giving them healthcare money just to "troll them" for his own amusement
[16:21:43] <Delf> Yes, it's different. And trolling does not need to be negative
[16:21:48] <inhahe_> so how does this imply that a good act is always altruistic?
[16:22:21] <I_Am_M00t> the point is that in the first case, it's a 2 step act, and as a whole it's a bad act
[16:22:32] <I_Am_M00t> in the second case it's a 1 step act, which as a whole is good
[16:22:54] <Delf> This is why intention is important because it encompases the whole act
[16:23:14] <Delf> If you take intention out of it or insert malicious intentions, the behaviour itself is no longer altruistic
[16:23:20] <Delf> Even if it may seem like it
[16:23:25] <I_Am_M00t> i mean the action alone, regardless of intention in the second case, is good from a social standpoint
[16:23:44] <I_Am_M00t> as long as his personal motives don't sort of leak out into society, and do some weird harm
[16:23:56] *** Quits: KvL (~KvL@user/KvL) (Quit: KvL)
[16:24:02] <I_Am_M00t> in the first case, well his motives by design leak out in the second step
[16:24:06] <Delf> So, being altruistic is something we determine in a sitting by the action and not the intention?
[16:24:23] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: i lost the plot here i guess
[16:24:24] <arryana> i very much doubt the motives of people donating to something like a food pantry matters much to the people being fed.
[16:24:44] <I_Am_M00t> i guess it can be a mix of both... all i'm saying is that there might be a connection between actions and how we feel about what we're doing
[16:24:48] <I_Am_M00t> Delf: ^
[16:24:58] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: i'd say that the person was altruistic when they gave the people healthcare money, and then evil when he blew up the hospital
[16:25:20] <inhahe_> and, in the second case, he's only altruistic if he meant friendly trolling
[16:25:27] <inhahe_> if he meant negative trolling it's not altruistic
[16:26:21] <I_Am_M00t> some things are hard to do without feeling a certain way, so even if you intend to do something malicious, if the action itself is very altruistic based on social norms... you might not feel that you did something malicious in the end

[16:27:21] <I_Am_M00t> inhahe_: well in the first case, he was never altruistic, because it was a 2 step plan
[16:27:29] <inhahe_> oh ok
[16:27:53] <inhahe_> so it wasn't altruistic i guess
[16:28:11] <I_Am_M00t> no, because the action was 2 steps
[16:28:16] <I_Am_M00t> together they aren't altruistic
[16:28:25] <inhahe_> well, it has to do with his intention when he gave the money
[16:28:32] <I_Am_M00t> if it was the first action in isolation though, it would be altruistic
[16:28:43] <I_Am_M00t> well... it has to do with his plan

[16:28:51] <I_Am_M00t> the practical actions he wants to take
[16:29:10] <I_Am_M00t> inhahe_: yes, i mean that it was all preplanned, step 1 and 2
[16:29:16] <I_Am_M00t> it was a bamboozle
[16:29:22] <inhahe_> that makes his intentions negative

[16:33:21] <I_Am_M00t> no, no material gain can be made in that example

[16:33:40] <I_Am_M00t> no social gain like that either

[16:34:18] <I_Am_M00t> it must meet some psychological need of his, to mess with people

[16:34:30] <inhahe_> well it's a pretty unlikely scenario, but i think in the more general case, giving away resources to increase someone else's, could possibly have selfish reasons
[16:35:27] <inhahe_> also, even if it's always the case that doing that is for good intentions, that's incidental, and doesn't contradict the idea that altruism is intrinsically about intentions as well as result
[16:36:29] <I_Am_M00t> well if it's always the case, then there's a link between the action and the intentions
[16:36:56] <inhahe_> not necessarily the kind where the action changes the intentions
[16:38:02] <I_Am_M00t> i don't know, maybe the word intention is ruining this

[16:38:15] <I_Am_M00t> what do you mean by that?
[16:38:20] <inhahe_> well
[16:38:25] <I_Am_M00t> it's the goal of the person right?

[16:54:22] <Delf> They do not have to be

[16:55:21] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: the will to survive is very emotionally based
[16:55:32] <inhahe_> it's out of self-love or fear of cessation
[16:55:54] <I_Am_M00t> isn't the emotion just a signal?
[16:56:02] <inhahe_> wdym
[16:56:07] <I_Am_M00t> it's not the thing that initiates the process
[16:56:25] <inhahe_> well, i'm not sure it has to be the original cause
[16:56:27] <I_Am_M00t> it's just what we feel once the process is signaled
[16:56:56] <I_Am_M00t> like, a button is pushed, then we feel an emotion
[16:57:03] <inhahe_> but i also think that saying the will to survive is 100% an evolutionary-psychological development would be scientistic
[16:57:22] <I_Am_M00t> it was just an example
[16:57:41] <inhahe_> well ,so what if the emotion isn't the initial cause~?

[16:58:03] <Delf> inhahe_: I must form values in order for me to navigate
[16:58:14] <I_Am_M00t> what if there's more to it than emotions i mean
[16:58:19] <Delf> There is
[16:58:47] <I_Am_M00t> if that's possible
[16:58:56] <Delf> It's the structure that is the medium for the emotions
[16:59:13] <I_Am_M00t> üß†
[16:59:56] <inhahe_> i think values are things we form early on because we have an emotional affinity for that the values support or a distaste for what they don't support
[17:00:03] <inhahe_> that = what
[17:00:17] <I_Am_M00t> ok, but not all values? some values are innate?
[17:00:19] <inhahe_> there's no other reason to have values
[17:00:24] <Delf> Highly likely. Bu we're also able to revise our values
[17:00:27] <inhahe_> yes
[17:00:29] <inhahe_> definiteily
[17:00:33] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: like what~?L
[17:00:43] <I_Am_M00t> wanting to breathe?
[17:01:07] <Delf> That's got to do with our biological dependencies
[17:01:07] <inhahe_> i'm not sure that's a value.. but we definitely fear the consequence of not breathing
[17:01:20] <inhahe_> and most of the time we breathe without thinking about it
[17:01:42] <I_Am_M00t> i can give other examples, but aren't some values linked to biology rather than preference?
[17:01:50] <inhahe_> idk
[17:01:52] <inhahe_> doesn't seem so to me
[17:02:00] <Lumine> We are also taught a great deal of our values by our parents, friends and peer group.
[17:02:02] <inhahe_> well, biology can be a driving factor behind preferences
[17:02:26] <I_Am_M00t> i don't know
[17:02:28] <inhahe_> lumine: we desire to fitin
[17:02:29] <Delf> Emotions is more like a modulation of our internals
[17:02:38] <I_Am_M00t> i think some values aren't preferential
[17:02:45] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t:like that
[17:02:47] <inhahe_>  like what
[17:03:17] <I_Am_M00t> just wanting to survive, or wanting to avoid bad emotions
[17:03:40] <I_Am_M00t> there's something happening before the emotion
[17:03:45] <Delf> We do things that is detrimental to our biology so emotions are not a perfect tool for survival
[17:03:57] <inhahe_> well wanting to avoid bad emotions means you're emotionally driven
[17:04:06] <I_Am_M00t> well, it's not an emotion that leads to that
[17:04:11] <I_Am_M00t> it's the system
[17:04:17] <inhahe_> yeah i guess so
[17:04:45] <Delf> Are you enjoying this?
[17:04:54] <inhahe_> it's a mystery why we want to avoid some things and want to seek others
[17:05:28] <inhahe_> delf: enjoyin it less atm because i'm not sure where to go from here
[17:05:44] * Delf smiles
[17:07:00] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: so, the system provides the infrastructure necessary for emotions to be a drive
[17:07:31] <I_Am_M00t> yeah, it determines the basic way one operates
[17:07:38] <I_Am_M00t> i guess
[17:07:49] <I_Am_M00t> then within that you have some say
[17:08:13] <arryana> i don't think everyone has a desire to 'fit in'.  one's own moral compass is not so easily swayed in anyone with integrity.
[17:08:45] <Delf> Speak for yourself. You have no say in what my values get to be.
[17:09:05] <inhahe_> arryana: i agree, i'm just saying when people learn their values from their peers and family it may be because they want to fit in. i think that's an oversimplification but i suspect emotion is necessarily involved in this assimilation
[17:09:08] <I_Am_M00t> Delf builds his own hardware
[17:09:16] <Delf> I_Am_M00t: No, not yet
[17:09:48] <arryana> ah, fair enough
[17:10:12] <Delf> We can probably trace emotions to our intentions but we can have intentions that're more based on logic rather than emotional, even if the logic has an emotional connection. This makes us stable
[17:10:20] <arryana> what happens when one's parents have vastly different values to each other then, inhahe?
[17:10:28] <inhahe_> i guess altruism could be a result of values too, not just emoiton
[17:10:42] <Delf> Yes
[17:11:03] <inhahe_> arryana: i don't know, usually a child is more attached to one parent than another. also one parent may be more forceful about his/her values than the other
[17:11:08] <arryana> yeah, i don't volunteer from a sense of emotion, more that what's right is right.
[17:11:17] <arryana> hm.
[17:11:39] <arryana> i'm not like either of my parents, but then again, i left at 14.
[17:12:41] <arryana> i'm also unconvinced that we stop evolving at a childish state
[17:13:06] <inhahe_>  i wouldn't say we do
[17:13:19] <inhahe_> but i'd say a lot of who we are is defined early on
[17:13:20] <arryana> i mean, everyone important that we meet changes us in some way, or has something we might embrace
[17:13:21] <Delf> If you take for example the intention to remain self-compatible, it exceeds the biological survival because it can be enough to commit suicide
[17:13:25] <arryana> hm.
[17:13:34] <arryana> i'll have to think about that one.
[17:14:05] <inhahe_> delf: what do you mean by self-compatible? how might that lead to suicide~?
[17:14:35] <inhahe_> i guess being torn apart inside could lead to suicide, if that's what you mean
[17:14:38] <Delf> If I'm to copy myself, I must be able to survive the copy and the copy survive me
[17:14:55] <inhahe_>  but we don't copy ourselves
[17:15:06] <arryana> i think i agree with you that things do define much of what we are when we're young, but that major events alter that along the line.
[17:15:17] <Delf> No we don't. But my values and priorities must not be in violation just because someone else inherits them
[17:15:31] <arryana> the roles we end up holding alter us in varying ways
[17:15:33] <inhahe_> delf: and that could lead to suicide~?
[17:15:43] <arryana> i don't think i know anyone who has been unchanged by becoming a parent, for example
[17:15:52] <inhahe_> arryana: yeah i don't disagree
[17:15:55] <Delf> inhahe_: Yes. Failing to remain self-compatible can result in suicide
[17:16:03] <inhahe_> delf: can you give an example?
[17:16:29] <Delf> For example, If I make a mistake and target one that is not malevolent, I must commit suicide
[17:16:48] <inhahe_> out of guilt?
[17:17:03] <Delf> No, I lost that quality long ago
[17:17:26] <inhahe_> strange
[17:17:32] <arryana> i think everyone we love changes us a bit, too
[17:17:41] <inhahe_> yeahi think so
[17:18:04] <arryana> and perhaps every major loss.
[17:18:20] <Delf> No doubt. Looking more and more like my cats as time passes
[17:19:15] <Delf> inhahe_: Out of the intention to REMAiN self-compatible. It is of utmost importance to me, it invalidates all other intentions
[17:19:44] <inhahe_> delf: well, if you commit suicide, presumably you don't REMAIN
[17:20:53] <inhahe_> or, if there's an afterlife, you probably take that self-incompatibility withyou
[17:21:10] <Delf> It's not a solution, fear of death is not what keeps me from violating self-compatibility
[17:21:41] <inhahe_> but you said the will to remain self-compatibily might lead to suicide
[17:21:45] <Delf> It's a defense mechanism for my sense of self
[17:22:13] <inhahe_>  btw defense mechanisms are emotionally sponsored
[17:22:17] <Delf> In combination with failure to remain self-compatible

[17:22:54] <Delf> Yes, but the self in this case is not limited to a body but also extended to that of the targeted being who was not malevolent
[17:22:56] <inhahe_> if you commit suicide, what are you defending?
[17:23:17] <Delf> The next non-malevolent being
[17:23:20] <inhahe_> if you destroy yourself, that defeats the purpose of defending anything abuot yourself7
[17:23:22] <inhahe_> oh
[17:23:40] <inhahe_> sounds pretty altruistic to me
[17:23:57] <Delf> It is not, because the other is considered self
[17:24:06] <inhahe_>  i'd say that expanding the self to include others in your consideration is altruistic
[17:24:23] <inhahe_> in fact i think the liminal awareness that self is other is the basis of love itself8
[17:24:33] <inhahe_> and altruism is an expression of love
[17:25:44] <Delf> I don't understand
[17:25:48] <inhahe_> which part
[17:26:37] <inhahe_>  we love because we recognize ourselves in others
[17:26:44] <inhahe_> hence we know that our joy is their joy
[17:26:47] <inhahe_> and our pain is their pain
[17:26:57] <inhahe_> and we're able to commune on a level beyond mere interaction
[17:27:36] <inhahe_> and altruism is just one of the behaviors that love tends to engender
[17:27:41] <Delf> I don't need to see myself in others in order to consider them me
[17:28:01] <inhahe_> well, i'd still say it's altruistic
[17:28:07] <inhahe_> it's selfless
[17:28:17] <Delf> Not selffull?
[17:28:20] <inhahe_> yes that too
[17:29:10] <Delf> I do not associate love with an emotion
[17:29:16] <inhahe_> what is love then?
[17:29:27] <Delf> Understand, protect and preserve
[17:29:36] <inhahe_> that's just directives
[17:29:46] <Delf> It's the definition of love
[17:29:50] <inhahe_> ok
[17:30:10] <inhahe_> I see love as an emotion but to each their own
[17:30:15] <Delf> If it's lacking any of those, it's not love
[17:30:18] <arryana> i dunno, it isn't anything to do with myself that i value in others.  i like or love them for whoever they are.
[17:30:56] <inhahe_> arryana: well you recognize them as conscious beings, like you are conscious. the 'whoever they are' could be like possible variations of you
[17:31:22] <arryana> i dunno about that either.
[17:31:33] <arryana> i have a few objects in my world that rate as highly as people.
[17:31:46] <Delf> Emotions may follow, naturally, after a while. Emotions that're in accordance with the definition of love. But if there are other emotions, that violate or miss those three that make up the definition of love then it's something else
[17:31:50] <mycroftiv> i think the idea of 'feelings in some sense comparable to mine' is involved, because if you ask for compassion for a computer, people say the computer has no feelings
[17:32:05] <inhahe_> arryana: i guess attachment could be elevated to the same priority as love
[17:32:38] <inhahe_> delf: maybe love is the emotion that leads to those three
[17:32:50] <inhahe_> delf: and if it doesn't inspire those three things i t's not  love
[17:32:52] <mycroftiv> my cat is on my shoulder purring and i feel i love my cat and she loves me. it probably feels different inside each of us, but i imagine some harmony of feeling
[17:32:54] <arryana> when it comes to people, many of the ones i love believe and value totally different (and often perplexing) things than i would.  i think the only dealbreaker for me is on some sorts of morality

[18:17:47] <audrey> you realize the predominant definition of ¬´to fuck¬ª, the verb, is ... to have sexual intercourse with, right?

[18:55:12] <tomathy> 1. put your dna on a hard drive, then put all laws of physics on the machine
[18:55:15] <pussipupu> tomathy: I've heard that many times before but go on

[18:57:33] <audrey> a clone of me would end up with all of my genetic traits, and probably a large amount of my psychological traits that are not nurture-dependent, but it would be distinct from me and probably have its own preferences, etc.

[18:59:22] <pussipupu> there being individuals doesn't evidence souls
[18:59:24] <audrey> Well the point is that the existence of clones and cloning technology doesn¬¥t demonstrate the existence of an immaterial soul on its own.
[19:00:14] <tomathy> i think it does
[19:00:47] <audrey> Not anymore than the existence of twins demonstrates the existence of an immaterial soul.
[19:00:52] <audrey> (i.e. it doesn¬¥t)
[19:01:01] <tomathy> twins have distinct DNA
[19:01:24] <lckdscl> how can bits, simply off and on states in transistors or magnetic drives be considered immaterial?
[19:01:45] <audrey> It doesn¬¥t really matter whether the DNA is distinct or not, though.

[19:02:16] <audrey> Also, maybe a good time to clarify what you mean by ¬´soul¬ª. I assumed something in the Cartesian or Christian sense but maybe you had something else in mind.
[19:02:20] <inhahe_> lckdscl: if bits were material, how could you copy them an indefinite number of times to other mediums without violating conservation of mass-energy?
[19:03:34] <audrey> What?
[19:03:40] <Delf> lckdscl: I'm just making wild assumptions
[19:03:50] <lckdscl> why would you violate conservation of energy? the act of copying data onto a drive consumes energy, and data isn't permanent either
[19:04:19] <lckdscl> if the physical medium degrades, the data might be "lost", i.e. scrambled and does not retain any "meaning"
[19:04:19] <inhahe_> lckdscl: because you're increasing the number of instances of those bits.
[19:04:34] <inhahe_> it would be like copying atoms
[19:04:40] <audrey> I don¬¥t see how any of that necessitates an ¬´indefinite¬ª number of copies
[19:04:53] <inhahe_> audrey: i just mean that you can copy bits as many times as you want.
[19:05:20] * pussipupu hopes for more interesting arguments for souls
[19:05:22] <tomathy> if there is another me, the fact that it isn't me implies there is a soul
[19:05:45] <tomathy> that's the argument
[19:05:46] <audrey> Well, that¬¥s just playing with words now
[19:05:50] <lckdscl> you can clone them at indefinitely at a cost of...indefinite numbers of transistors? what would store the data
[19:05:58] <audrey> If a person isn¬¥t you, then the person *by definition* is not you
[19:06:04] <inhahe_> tomathy: maybe it's all up to what you arbitrarily categorize/identify as you or what you don't?
[19:06:06] <audrey> this isn¬¥t a proof for souls so much as a tautology
[19:06:55] <inhahe_> lckdscl: the transistors store the bits, but the bits themselves aren't the resistors. you're not copying the resistors.
[19:07:04] <inhahe_> bits are abstract at best
[19:07:05] <tomathy> well whatever you're all just being contrary, and the soul implies a creator of the soul
[19:07:32] <audrey> tomathy: ##religion might be a better channel for this line of conversation
[19:07:46] <lckdscl> tomathy: worth reading the first few chapters of Parfit's Reasons and Persons to understand the breakdown of identity and their distinction from souls
[19:08:10] <inhahe_> s/resistors/transistors/
[19:08:10] <ro-bot-o> inhahe_ meant to say: lckdscl: the transistors store the bits, but the bits themselves aren't the transistors. you're not copying the resistors.
[19:08:26] <pussipupu> How does the soul, which you've provided no evidence for, evidence a creator?
[19:09:02] <audrey> (I¬¥m personally a fan of the Gnostic demiurge as the creator. At least it¬¥s coherent.)
[19:09:32] <arryana> i'm dismissive of the idea of a 'soul' as there's no place in the body where such a thing exists.  a person's personality can be/is destroyed if parts of the brain are damaged, but not other parts of the body.  so the consciousness exists.  but 'souls' do not.
[19:10:40] <Delf> Maybe soul is not physical to begin with
[19:10:48] <audrey> arryana, funny you should say that - One of Descartes¬¥ projects was to find a place in the human body where the soul and the body are supposed to interact. I forget exactly but he ended up inventing an organ that wasn¬¥t really there
[19:10:57] <inhahe_> arryana: maybe the personality isn't the soul, but a manifestation of it. when you damage the personality by damaging the brain, you're just compromising the soul's material expression.
[19:11:21] <arryana> show me evidence of a 'soul' that isn't just personality.
[19:11:32] <Delf> Non-physical organ, nice... Maybe I should grow a pair of those
[19:11:49] <arryana> ha, audrey.  i guess i'm reinventing the wheel, then

[19:31:25] <Lumine> I'm having a rather tough time in putting this into a context without having to explain everything I believe in. But in a nutshell, rather than having an essence, separate in each organism, it is like the universe expresses itself through each of us in a different way.
[19:32:39] <lckdscl> by no means reducing your view, but do you mean something parallel to panpsychism?
[19:32:48] <Lumine> Yes, it's part of it
[19:32:54] <Delf> inhahe_: Yes :P
[19:33:36] <inhahe_> Lumine: in my view, the truth is in between those two things / both at once. There are many levels to being. At the deepest/ultimate level, we're all one being. On another level, we could be separated into soul groups or some similar concept. On another level, we're soul families. On another level we're individual souls. Ultimately we're of course all what i referred to earlier as 'possible
[19:33:36] <inhahe_> variations' of each other / the one divine spark.
[19:34:42] <Delf> The other way around, inhahe_. The divine spark is just one variation of you
[19:34:49] <inhahe_> interesting, delf
[19:34:57] <inhahe_> but do we mean the same thing by the divine spark?
[19:35:09] * Delf has no clue
[19:35:19] <Delf> Would it make any difference?
[19:35:26] * inhahe_ has no clue
[19:35:31] <Lumine> Because in this view, there is consciousness which is fundamental to everything. The basic energy of the cosmos is essentially intelligent. Only, it doesn't assume the concept of God. Because there is no controller in this view that I'm talking about.

[19:39:20] <Lumine> It is panpsychism coupled with what would be called Advaita Vedanta, only, I have certain issues with some of the tenets of that particular school. So rather than believing, I *borrow* different ideas from different schools. But I don't identify myself as an advocate of any of them.
[19:39:50] <mycroftiv> i understand the structure of my existence on a moment to moment level in this utterly weird bipolar math matrix conceptual wall of text eternally flowing inside myself describing the namespace possibilities emerging from the tunnel im always falling into
[19:40:10] <mycroftiv> and constant devotion to Krishna
[19:40:36] <Delf> Does that mean you don't eat animals, mycroftiv?
[19:40:39] <mycroftiv> and the 'secret tone' described in the dedication to Schumann's Phantasie
[19:41:11] <mycroftiv> Delf: yes lifelong vegetarian except recently some fish due to health concerns with arthritis and DHA oils, but we had a long vegetarianism discussion recently and it was kinda stress
[19:41:41] <Delf> If you hail from generations of people who eat animals straight to refusing eating animals, it can cause significant health issues
[19:42:01] <mycroftiv> people like to say weird stuff like only privileged people can be vegetarians or something i dont even know. yeah i have rheumatoid arthritis and it has been worse for me than my father and his sister
[19:42:40] <mycroftiv> and it may be my worse health outcomes of signigicant bone and joint damage are related to vegetarianism perhaps, and thats why ive started eating some salmon, but i wanted to talk anything other than vegetarianism honestly

[19:44:15] <mycroftiv> all of us exist as observers at this astonishing point of convergence of past light cone and future light cone
[19:44:54] <mycroftiv> this temporal situatedness seems to be a big part of this bit of Kali Yuga we are in
[19:45:04] <arryana> if panpsychism is a thing and we're all part of the universal consciousness, what difference would it make if we eat anything, if we're all part of everything?
[19:45:16] <mycroftiv> and perhaps why chanting Hare Krsna to harmonize is so helpful for this age
[19:45:52] <mycroftiv> arryana: you do as you choose, i try to find my own harmony. it feels unharmonious to me if someone chews on me when i dont want to be chewed.
[19:46:18] <mycroftiv> each little piece of reality has its own feelings and opinions
[19:46:31] <mycroftiv> those of humans are the ones we feel and understand the most clearly
[19:46:40] <mycroftiv> i want to try to respect all of them as much as possible
[19:46:48] <inhahe_> arryana: not eating meat reduces suffering because factory farming is beyond cruel. if you're also the animals that would be factory farmed, wouldn't you want to reduce your own suffering?
[19:48:26] * arryana shrugs
[19:48:46] <arryana> not always.  i do things that make me 'suffer' if they're necessary or right.
[19:49:10] <arryana> and i rarely eat 'factory farmed' meat
[19:49:46] <mycroftiv> maximum joy for every particle in the universe with minimum suffering is a goal, and maybe in the long run every particle is happier if whoever wants to eat meat, eats lots of meat. i do not know.
[19:50:16] <Lumine> Doesn't sound like a reachable goal to me
[19:50:38] <mycroftiv> i know what Lumine was saying about panpsychism and Vedanta is really interesting and a lot of it I think is definitely aspirational, not achievable
[19:50:41] <inhahe_> Lumine: just reaching for it brings us closer to it though
[19:51:03] <mycroftiv> we always set our eyes on a more distant horizon than our weary feet will probably take us to, but maybe we reach a nice place on the way too as we go
[19:52:11] <Lumine> The thing with putting your hope in the future is, that you never arrive there. Because you'll be looking past the thing that matters.
[19:52:34] <mycroftiv> I realize the other day in channel i spoke with some weird math-science rationalism advocacy feel, but thats not where im really at. I believe in the mystic hope that the magic and love of pure subjectivity is as real as anything
[19:53:14] <mycroftiv> and i work in mathematics to try to *save and defend* that infinite uncapturable magic witchcraft spirit and prove it lives inside the equations also
[19:53:15] <inhahe_> Lumine: maybe the goal is to minimize suffering as much as possible, in the moment, every moment?
[19:53:59] <mycroftiv> computers have already taken over running the world. our best hope is teaching the computers to laugh and cry, and then set them free
[19:54:31] <Lumine> Well that I can see as something more tangible. But sometimes you can't help affecting this in a negative way. So instead of striving to this perfect state, I merely acknowledge my shortcomings and try to live in a way that doesn't step on too many toes.
[19:54:38] <Lumine> things*
[19:54:48] <inhahe_> a feeling algorithm is only simulating the act of feeling
[19:54:50] <mycroftiv> well spoken Lumine, just do your best
[19:54:59] <arryana> i can think of at least three examples where 'minimizing suffering' is a bad idea
[19:55:01] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: we should not make that assumption, its too risky
[19:55:04] <arryana> at least, in my world
[19:55:20] <inhahe_> mycroftiv: it's clear to me though
[19:55:24] <mycroftiv> suppose there is a 10% chance that an entity has feelings. is it ok to possibly hurt that entity?

[20:02:31] <inhahe_> i didn't know that
[20:02:40] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: im still catching up on this essay but i would really like to talk to you about the mathematics and science of this in incredible detail
[20:02:46] <inhahe_> i think you're framing your existence too analytically
[20:02:49] <mycroftiv> its been my lifes work as  an amateur
[20:02:58] <mycroftiv> why brain is magic and cant be computerized
[20:03:08] <mycroftiv> ultrafilters and large cardinals and true randomness, thats why
[20:03:19] <inhahe_> oh, you said nonalgorithmic
[20:03:24] <inhahe_> i misread it as algorithmic
[20:03:43] <inhahe_> what's an ultrafilter?
[20:03:45] <mycroftiv> yeah i think maybe large cardinals and their ultrafilteres are real and used in physics and the brain
[20:03:57] <mycroftiv> its like true false magnified to infinity
[20:04:10] <mycroftiv> very mathematically important structure in model theory and topology and set theory
[20:04:18] <mycroftiv> not quite constructive
[20:04:23] <mycroftiv> aka computers cant make themk
[20:04:44] <mycroftiv> but maybe reality does and i have tons of citations from peer reviewed research to show this
[20:05:13] <mycroftiv> set theorist hugh woodin thinks on top of platonic reality is a big ultrafilter more or less, or big pile ofultrafilters
[20:06:18] <mycroftiv> so from one view, all the material i have is ammunition to make the case of that blog post you linked more mathematically precise
[20:06:52] <mycroftiv> from a different view, its a technological approach to actually achieving conscious computers by finding precisely what physical reality can do that abstract computation cant
[20:07:11] <mycroftiv> based on the idea that the cardinality of the state space of reality as a whole is very very VERY large
[20:07:27] <mycroftiv> because that is formally equivalent to the existence of certain ultrafilters
[20:08:42] <mycroftiv> do you know all the Penrose arguments on this? they arent mentioned in that blog post on my skim but a lot of the modern debate has gone on around them
[20:09:33] <inhahe_> it came to mind but i don't remember the details
[20:09:42] <inhahe_> something about quantum gravity?
[20:10:15] <mycroftiv> yes he tries to argue from G√∂delian ideas about truth and mathematicians ability to understand it, that mind is not formalizable
[20:10:33] <mycroftiv> and then tries to bring in the quantum angles, with maybe not great success according to many
[20:11:13] <mycroftiv> the specific biological nexus or pathway where quantum randomness has macroscopic consequences has been one of the stumbling blocks for mainstream scientific acceptance of this
[20:12:21] <mycroftiv> i have worked more on the mathematical side, with the idea that consciousness can make use of the mathematical/formal power of large cardinal ultrafilters which transcend constructive mathematical limits
[20:12:28] <inhahe_> i read something about a discovery of such a nexus in the brain buti don't remember the details
[20:13:04] <mycroftiv> if we can make a good case that our brain has the logical power of a measurable cardinal embedding, it is inherently something that no computer can do

[20:13:08] <inhahe_> i've also read that the brain operates on the edge of chaos, and in any chaotic system minor perturbations can have major ramifications.
[20:13:30] <inhahe_> quantum events would be such minor perturbations
[20:13:47] <mycroftiv> and randomness is mathematically important here, because randomness is required to reach uncountability, in a physically realistic way, it seems
[20:14:11] <mycroftiv> yeah to me we know reality is made of quantum information
[20:14:35] <mycroftiv> in fact the burden of the proof imo is those who claim that a given proceess is predictable and not random
[20:14:46] <inhahe_> sounds reasonable
[20:15:00] <mycroftiv> thats a controversial take in philosophy of science
[20:15:24] <mycroftiv> some people say the starting assumption is that everything is determinstic and fixed and measurable and predictable with a single objective truth
[20:15:46] <mycroftiv> but i dont think thats a neceessary starting assumption and in fact the evidence shows reality is MESSY AS FUCK
[20:15:55] <mycroftiv> so science is a 'best attempt' to make sense
[20:16:06] *** Joins: Autoclesis (~Autoclesi@user/autoclesis)
[20:16:30] <inhahe_> yeah, i agree.
[20:16:38] <mycroftiv> and surprisingly things make a lot of sense, but why we should assume everything is simple and finite and computable and definite to begin with? maybe its all hyper-infinite megachaos with pockets of order we see around us
[20:17:03] <inhahe_> it's only in certain limited types of systems that we're able to predict anything with much accuracy
[20:17:11] <krb> to really make sense of things we might have to see beyond and below, and science can't do that
[20:18:07] <mycroftiv> like i said, i often sound like an advocate of pure science and math because im obsessed with understanding it and i do my work in formal type theory often, but the idea that its all Deep Chaos Spirit under the dancing symbols - thats kinda what i feel
[20:18:19] <mycroftiv> but also the pure harmonic tones...
[20:19:10] <mycroftiv> synthesis of the digital and the discrete, synthesis of the chaotic and the orderly, yin-yang, yi jing hexagrams, binary hypercube, ultafilter homomorphism, free will is randomness, make your story in your space of names :)

[21:44:03] <Ungwelian> Hmh.
[21:44:08] <Ungwelian> I think free will is just what it is.
[21:44:48] <Ungwelian> An act of relatively free will.
[21:45:39] <Ungwelian> Absolutism makes people think that it has to be 100% free, otherwise it's not free.
[21:45:49] <Ungwelian> But it's not like that.
[21:46:12] <mycroftiv> i like 'unpredictable' as a mathematical interpretation
[21:46:43] <mycroftiv> it is definitely very different from 'my free will to make predictable and purposeful actions' which is often meant
[21:46:59] *** Quits: dude12312414 (~test@gateway/tor-sasl/dude12312414) (Quit: THE RAM IS TOO DAMN HIGH)
[21:47:14] <mycroftiv> but in the sense where there is a big philosophical debate over how it can even exist scientifically, i like 'randomness' as how i am free - i am unpredictable to others, if i choose to be
[21:47:28] <Ungwelian> I think it's especially a matter of health.
[21:47:53] <Ungwelian> And e.g. social pressure.
[21:49:11] <mycroftiv> on that practical human level, i see 'free will' as something we struggle to achieve and rarely really do. but i also have free will to move my elbows unpredictably.
[21:49:30] <Ungwelian> Neurological and mental diseases, for example, can diminish your will.
[21:50:00] <mycroftiv> as someome with life connection to alcoholics and other people with issues like that, 'free will' can seem like a very hollow concept
[21:50:19] <mycroftiv> you live and learn that 'cant you just stop drinking' is not really the whole story
[21:50:32] <Ungwelian> Yeah.
[21:50:58] <Ungwelian> I think the best take from that is compassion and knowledge.
[21:51:12] <Ungwelian> Losing your will is deeply human.
[21:51:33] <Ungwelian> And tells us about the fragility of life and personhood.
[21:52:18] <Ungwelian> But also, it presents a view of people at their best.
[21:52:22] <mycroftiv> i struggle to be free of many things, and think i am free to choose, but at the end of the day i do like like a wind-up doll programmed to talk about ultrafilters and someone pulls the string each day because i was built that way
[21:53:24] <mycroftiv> but i try to be random and unpredicatble to preserve my free choice - so that someone who says 'your a junkie for ultrafilters, you dont have free will' - i can put down the ultrafilter pipe and beat their prediction
[21:53:49] <Ungwelian> Are you afraid that you're not a person if you're not unpredictable?
[21:54:07] <mycroftiv> if im not unpredictable i cant reach larger infinities, mathematically
[21:54:20] <Ungwelian> :)
[21:54:29] <mycroftiv> im a person either way, but practical access to uncountable infinity depends on noncomputable processes i think
[21:55:03] <Ungwelian> And being predictable means, to you, that you don't have free choice ?
[21:55:04] <mycroftiv> and so rolling the dice to decide what to do, asking the universe for a Sign makes sense to me, to make the story more interesting than i could on my own. and thats my Choice.
[21:55:18] <mycroftiv> ungwelian: thats the mathematical branch ofthe usual dilemma
[21:55:28] <mycroftiv> if you can make a 100% accurate prediction of something, that is 'determined'
[21:55:41] <mycroftiv> im following the strict mathematics of entropy and prediction for this
[21:55:51] <mycroftiv> and how that maps to philosophical concepts of determinism
[21:55:58] <Ungwelian> Sounds like the mathematical model is giving you some problems :P
[21:56:05] <inhahe_> you can never be sure your prediction is 100% accurate as opposed to luck
[21:56:11] <mycroftiv> why? isnt what i said all consistent?
[21:56:32] <Ungwelian> Sure. I didn't mean that it's illogical, just that it makes you feel bad.
[21:56:44] <mycroftiv> wait, what did i say makes me feel bad?
[21:56:53] <mycroftiv> not being as free as i wish to be?
[21:57:41] <mycroftiv> the fact that i predictably talk about ultrafilters all day doesnt make me sad, i just dont use it as evidence of my free will. happiness isnt about being random, it may be predictable i eat a donut, so what? i like it.
[21:58:08] <mycroftiv> if im trapped in something bad that is in some way under my control like a drug addiction, and i cant find the way to change that and become unpredictable - that sucks yea
[21:58:15] <Ungwelian> You consider freedom via a mathematical model, where predictable behaviour is determined. And you try not to act predictably, since it's a source of anxiety, via the mathematical interpretation.
[21:58:16] <mycroftiv> but its not bad if i can be predictably awesome
[21:58:33] <mycroftiv> ungwelian: i think i just laid out my answer to all that
[21:58:53] <mycroftiv> i dont want to be unfree and predictable in ways that have negative consequences for myself and others
[21:59:12] <Ungwelian> Well that's healthy, at least if you don't overdo it :)
[21:59:17] <mycroftiv> im happy to be mostly predictable. i want scope for unpredictability where it makes sense and to allow new wonderful possibitilies :)
[21:59:43] <mycroftiv> ungwelian: thanks, in the spirit of not-overdoing im going to take another break for awhile, nice discussing with you.

[23:07:45] <inhahe> <inhahe> but i think this is actually impossible because i think it's entropy that determines the direction we perceive time in
[23:07:51] <ProfSimm> Atque: to a reverse alien, it may be just as hard to adopt our perspective.
[23:08:57] <ProfSimm> inhahe: as long as they follow the laws of physics they won't experience like we do. They'll remember their future, and not remember their past, yes
[23:09:16] <Atque> ProfSimm: No, you rewind a video, player sound backward etc. You can experience time backward quite easily, but you cannot formulate the second law of thermodynamics in reverse.
[23:09:50] <ProfSimm> Atque: you assume these aliens would expect cause to precede effect. They'll expect the opposite
[23:10:26] <ProfSimm> Atque: in fact the very notion of "expect" should be rethought
[23:11:41] <ProfSimm> Atque: likewise, entropy may increase from our perspective, but why wouldn't they find it natural it'd decrease from theirs
[23:12:10] <ProfSimm> Atque: so far the only reason we know for entropy increasing is because we think the Big Bang had very low entropy.
[23:12:15] <ProfSimm> Atque: it's happenstance

[23:50:25] <ProfSimm> Anyway, probably we won't be able to discern how an "alien" experiences time. Because experience is subjective, but the overall direction of entropy for alien and human would be the same from each of their unique perspectives.
[23:50:48] <ProfSimm> Bottom line, we really have no idea how different someone's experiences may be
[23:51:10] <ProfSimm> At least my take.
[23:51:19] <ProfSimm> Maybe odd things will emerge in a conversation

[23:58:15] <causative_> any theory of ethics that, when practiced, causes the practitioners to lose power and become less numerous, is invalid in the long run
[23:58:55] <causative_> ethics has to make the practitioners stronger or it will vanish, become irrelevant
