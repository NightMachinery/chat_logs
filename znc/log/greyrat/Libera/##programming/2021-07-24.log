[00:35:45] <pyzozord> See? I just learned a new term, "type punning"
[00:36:49] <pyzozord> If I understand correctly it means "cast anything to anything else with the same memory layout"
[00:39:19] <user51> i learn new terms all the time. i think there's a paradox with knowledge: you'll notice how things can be quite similar at times
[00:39:41] <user51> think about your text editor, and think about your file. can you see the database?
[00:40:02] <pyzozord> It's kind of scary. It's not the usual "the more I learn the more I'm aware of what I don't know" although there is a bit of that, it's about "the more I learn, the more I forget previous things I learned AND I'm more awayre of what I don't know"
[00:40:04] <user51> and fwiw, until today i thought the term was 'type pruning' :P
[00:40:27] <user51> lots of it is practice, at least that's what worked for me
[00:41:22] <pyzozord> it's like my limited knowledge of things is replaced my knowledge about things I don't know. By now there is a whole lot of things more I know I don't know, and a lot less things I feel I actually know
[00:43:11] <user51> well, the simpliest way to handle this, at least in my opinion, is to rubber duck it
[00:43:46] <pyzozord> user51: yes, I'm hoping I can get good at the roots and the major branches and then relay on that to interpolate between these to get cheap aproximations of most things between these major branches

[00:48:53] <user51> GeDaMo: why?
[00:49:01] <user51> if i can do it once, i can do it again :D
[00:49:11] <GeDaMo> They're not efficient on modern hardware
[00:49:15] <pyzozord> they are extremly cpu cache hostile
[00:49:43] <user51> sure, the question is how much though.
[00:50:29] <GeDaMo> "Bjarne Stroustrup: Why you should avoid Linked Lists" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQs6IC-vgmo
[00:51:05] <pyzozord> most of modern cpus transistor counts goes into redundancies, branch predicting, caches, and generally out of order execution. If you are ignoring your cpu caches you are ignoring like 90% power of your cpu

[00:56:38] <GeDaMo> Hi ZeZo :)
[00:57:01] <user51> pyzozord: maybe the implementation uses alinked list
[00:58:54] <pyzozord> I think linked lists are cool but not for single integers, they need to be used for big chunks of memory
[00:59:51] <pyzozord> so like a linked list of chunks of array [1,2,3] -> [4,5,6] -> [7,8,9]
[01:00:03] <GeDaMo> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrolled_linked_list

[06:54:59] <InPhase> aaaa: It is.
[06:55:43] <InPhase> aaaa: People will tell you it's cross-platform, but this is a pretty limited definition of cross-platform.  The gui stuff for example does not cross well, which is pretty restrictive.

[06:57:19] <InPhase> aaaa: Java has gotten itself pretty fast, when things are written for speed.  Although in Java you're signing up for a bit of code overhead on everything you do, which can get frustrating at times.  There's "one way" to write Java code, and it's not always the convenient way for a problem.

[06:59:07] <InPhase> aaaa: If you appreciate OO structure for everything, and you want a cross-platform VM language, then Java is the go-to choice.  Personally I try to avoid it now, because it just kept getting in my way while writing.
[06:59:41] <InPhase> pikapika: Yes, for Java that is particularly true.  Not really for C++ though, which lets you write in a pretty modern C++ style and still get C speed.

[06:59:56] <aaaa> InPhase: thank you
[06:59:59] <InPhase> pikapika: The language has to be designed thoroughly for zero-cost abstractions for that to work out.

[07:01:59] <aaaa> i was surprised when i found out ryujinx(a nintendo switch emulator) was written in C#
[07:02:12] <Arahael> female_student_4: Recursion is a technique you should master.  It's not a good fit for python, but the concept will apply to other problems; It's a good problem and example to use to learn the concept with.
[07:02:15] <InPhase> female_student_4: Or more precisely, this is a toy problem designed to coerce you into thinking recursively about problems.
[07:02:36] <female_student_4> I know about recursion, it's just is the structure of the problem difficult to do it with it
[07:02:45] <female_student_4> By that I mean, the fact it is nested lists

[07:05:32] <InPhase> female_student_4: This will take more than just recursion though.  You will need to track the information between different entrances into each level with a separate state vector.  But you can do that, and just tell each call where to look for its level of data.
[07:06:08] <pikapika> female_student_4, a nested list is a tree
[07:06:42] <pikapika> InPhase, actually I don't think so much state is needed at all

[07:08:51] <InPhase> Of course as soon as you have a growing state vector you're into the regime where you can skip the recursion if you just pack enough into there and work purely on state.  But, using recursion to help will be easier and more educational.

[07:11:20] <Arahael> female_student_4: It's the _type_ of question.  This is a 'homework' question - a question designed to teach you something.
[07:11:44] <female_student_4> okay but I don't go to any school/ university. I've graduated and I just self-learn with a tutor
[07:11:45] <Arahael> female_student_4: Not neccessarily a question where a lecturer you're paying for has said: "Now, listen up. This is *HOMEWORK*..."
[07:12:19] <Arahael> female_student_4: Those specifics are a bit unimportant here.
[07:12:47] <female_student_4> yeah but saying its homework implies that I've been set some work for a grade when this is just me doing my own self-learning which is totally different

[07:14:32] <female_student_4> I'm not even annoyed as to whether you want to help more or not. It's just a wild assumption to say its homework
[07:15:04] <female_student_4> Even in the UK, where I'm from, and if this was an A level question. It would be set from a book or you'd be working on a specific project
[07:15:15] <female_student_4> and at Uni, you'd be given more like mini seminars involving projects
[07:15:21] <InPhase> female_student_4: Well you could /nick female_graduate_4 and maybe Arahael would make different assumptions.  ;)
[07:15:27] <female_student_4> Like, they wouldn't use websites like leet code, hackerrank, or edabit
[07:15:57] <Arahael> Yep, if this was a _graduate_, I'd have instead assumed they set themselves their own homework instead! ;D
[07:16:36] <female_student_4> Yeah, but I could still be a student and ask about a leetcode question in theory
[07:16:40] <female_student_4> They are mutually exclusive
[07:17:36] <InPhase> female_student_4: Although the spirit is the same.  It's good to give more minimal hints when people are working on problems for educational purposes, regardless of grading.  It just helps people out more when they're still actively working on it.  If you said, "I give up on this, can someone explain how to do it?" then it's a different scenario for self-study, and it's fine to just explain it.

[13:00:27] <OverCoder> ok
[13:00:46] <OverCoder> you'd assume everyone here knows how to speak English?
[13:01:55] <Arahael> OverCoder: If they want to talk to me, they'll either need an interpreter, or be content with written english, or use another language we both know.
[13:02:02] <OverCoder> hm
[13:02:20] <Arahael> OverCoder: I do personally know of an Arabic interpreter, btw.
[13:02:47] <OverCoder> hmmm
[13:03:01] <OverCoder> pikapika, hi
[13:03:04] <pulse> if you're a programmer you have to know english anyway
[13:03:20] <OverCoder> pulse, very very very very very very very true
[13:04:52] <Trashlord> hmmm
[13:05:02] <OverCoder> i reiterate I want an interesting front-end thing to do quickly
[13:05:05] <Arahael> OverCoder: The biggest problem with Arabic, is that it is so crazy full of "expressions", you basically have to be immersed in spoken Arabic culture to understand it well.  And that is not possible for me.
[13:05:10] <Trashlord> have to as in it's a requirement, or have to as in there's no way you didn't learn it?
[13:05:30] <OverCoder> Arahael, literally same with any language
[13:05:33] <OverCoder> I am a polyglot
[13:05:36] <OverCoder> learning Mandarin right now
[13:05:48] <Trashlord> you can be a programmer without knowing English, as long as you know the keywords and what they do
[13:05:52] <Trashlord> which can be explain in other languages
[13:06:00] <OverCoder> Trashlord, no
[13:06:02] <Trashlord> we should test this idea
[13:06:10] <Trashlord> someone design a proglang that isn't in English
[13:06:15] <OverCoder> it's impossible to code without learning English
[13:06:16] <Trashlord> but give all the explanations, documentation in English
[13:06:18] <Trashlord> see if we can learn it
[13:06:27] <Trashlord> without learning the actual language, say French
[13:06:29] <Trashlord> or Polish or something
[13:06:33] <Arahael> OverCoder: Mandarin would be even more difficult for me than Arabic, actually, though I've considered learning _classical_ chinese.
[13:06:33] <deniska> I learned Visual Basic before I learned English
[13:06:35] <OverCoder> I again say it's impossible
[13:06:36] <pikapika> French would be too easy
[13:06:40] <Trashlord> OverCoder: why impossible?
[13:06:45] <Trashlord> I don't see why it wouldn't work
[13:06:52] <OverCoder> Because you subconsiously look too much into SO and GitHub and documentation and stuff
[13:06:56] <Trashlord> you just remember the keywords of the programming language
[13:07:07] <OverCoder> in fact
[13:07:10] <Trashlord> so make all the documentation in English
[13:07:11] <deniska> SO? I don't remember SO in late 90s :D
[13:07:12] <Trashlord> like I said
[13:07:14] <OverCoder> uh
[13:07:15] <mrig> Hello :)
[13:07:22] <mrig> What does it mean to know a language?
[13:07:25] <OverCoder> remembering the keywords of a programming language does not help
[13:07:26] <pikapika> deniska, there were some russians who mostly used russian (transliterated)
[13:07:29] <OverCoder> if I wanted to use React.JS
[13:07:29] <mrig> Memorising 50 words or so?
[13:07:30] <Trashlord> I meant it could be done as an experiment to test this idea
[13:07:33] <OverCoder> how on earth do I learn that without english
[13:07:50] <mrig> or being able to understand and communicate with people in a foreign culture?
[13:07:54] <mrig> not the same thing.
[13:07:55] <Trashlord> how did you learn programming languages?
[13:07:58] <OverCoder> react hooks has an entire gigantic article here https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html
[13:07:59] <Arahael> mrig: Indeed.
[13:08:00] <deniska> OverCoder: You buy a book on reactjs in your native lang and read it
[13:08:04] <OverCoder> how do I learn react hooks without English
[13:08:13] <OverCoder> deniska, yeah ok at the time that front-end libs change every like 3 months
[13:08:24] <Trashlord> OverCoder: you make all the documentation in non-English?
[13:08:26] <OverCoder> it means you're at least 5 years behind technology
[13:08:27] <Trashlord> I don't see the problem

[13:08:47] <OverCoder> Trashlord, I learned programming parallel to English
[13:08:52] <Trashlord> but that doesn't mean you can't do it in other langs
[13:08:56] <deniska> OverCoder: mainstream frontend development is a useless and borderline harmful churn, but I digress :)
[13:09:03] <Trashlord> I learned English on IRC and then got into programming
[13:09:09] <OverCoder> I'm pretty leftist to that you can't be a good programmer and now know English
[13:09:09] <pikapika> Today there is a lot of churn
[13:09:10] <OverCoder> it's impossible

[13:09:24] <pikapika> 20-30 years ago it won't be too strange for a programmer to not know english
[13:09:24] <pulse> if you're trying to develop something and you don't know english... that's like, err, trying to cook blindfolded

[13:10:03] <deniska> learning english is really useful, but it's not a hard requirement to program
[13:10:09] <Trashlord> that's because all the existing documentation is in English
[13:10:12] <pulse> deniska, it kinda is
[13:10:13] * OverCoder furiously disagrees
[13:10:15] <Trashlord> it doesn't mean that it HAS to be that way
[13:10:18] <pulse> at least on any sort of professional level
[13:10:22] <OverCoder> ^
[13:10:26] <pulse> maybe you can get away with it on some amateur level
[13:10:29] <OverCoder> ^
[13:10:41] <Trashlord> that's just because English has been established as the language of the Internet and technology
[13:10:45] <Trashlord> that's the sole reason
[13:10:46] <OverCoder> yes?
[13:10:52] <deniska> And speaking of docs… I spent a lot of time googletranslating Chinese trying to program against taobao's APIs :)
[13:10:52] <Trashlord> so it doesn't mean it has to be English
[13:10:55] <Trashlord> it just happens to be
[13:10:56] <OverCoder> I mean yes we could flip the coin and make Arabic the established language
[13:11:00] <OverCoder> and have every resource in Arabic
[13:11:04] <OverCoder> and then yes that'd work
[13:11:10] <OverCoder> but that's not the case for the current world we live in
[13:11:20] <pikapika> The arabs are a smart bunch
[13:11:29] <Trashlord> so what I suggested is to create a programming language that's not in English, but make all the documentation, explanations, tutorials, etc in English
[13:11:40] <Trashlord> and then see that you can program in that langauge without knowing its parent natural langauge
[13:11:45] <pulse> Trashlord, why would anyone do that
[13:11:50] <OverCoder> pikapika, I'd like to say that every population has % of smart people, it's just whether they're allowed to express themselves or not
[13:11:58] <Arahael> Trashlord: Isn't that APL?
[13:12:00] <Trashlord> pulse: I don't see why anyone would, but it was just an idea to test it out
[13:12:01] <pulse> why would you willingly limit your audience to 0.001% of what it would be if you did it in english
[13:12:02] <OverCoder> in Syria if I find a solution to solve anything I'd be assassinated
[13:12:03] <Trashlord> Arahael: don't know
[13:12:26] <Trashlord> but consider also that many programmers who don't know English well also name their functions and variables in their native lang
[13:12:30] <Trashlord> I've seen it for Spanish
[13:12:32] <OverCoder> I mean
[13:12:33] <Trashlord> German
[13:12:39] <OverCoder> there's no point
[13:12:43] <pulse> just code in english, you can still do the front-end of your software in any language you wish
[13:12:50] <pulse> but code should be english and docs should be english etc.
[13:12:56] <pulse> it's just how things are
[13:13:04] <pulse> (i say this with english being my 3rd language)
[13:13:04] <Trashlord> I'm not saying I'd try to change things, there's no point in it
[13:13:06] <OverCoder> what you're literally saying is that let's reinvent computers from scratch but use for example Arabic all the way
[13:13:13] <OverCoder> starting from transistors and upwards
[13:13:18] <OverCoder> reinventing the civilization entirely
[13:13:20] <OverCoder> yes like why
[13:13:22] <Trashlord> I'm just saying that you CAN in fact learn a programming langauge without learning its parent natural langauge. That's all

[13:16:46] <Trashlord> because if the sign language would have different grammatical concepts than the corresponding spoken language.., I don't know
[13:16:58] <Arahael> It does.
[13:17:07] <Trashlord> so how do you understand it?
[13:17:17] <Trashlord> how can we communicate here? It feels bizarre to me

[13:17:33] <Trashlord> ah
[13:17:35] <Trashlord> hmm

[16:33:39] <austincheney> In node.js I am executing a child process (child_process.spawn), but it becomes a separate parent process as is the behavior in windows for windowed applications.  How can I access the stderr of that new process from my application?
[16:33:46] <Arahael> vdamewood: Joking, I don't think it's that common, escept for the popular ones that happen to be domain tld's.  es-419 is "latin american spanish".
[16:34:24] <Arahael> vdamewood: I've always found it wierd that that particular code has numbers, not letters.
[16:34:25] <austincheney> for example the I am opening a browser as a child process from my application
[16:34:36] <vdamewood> Arahael: As, as opposed to es_MX, or es_AG, etc.
[16:34:47] <vdamewood> Which would be country specific.
[16:35:05] <vdamewood> dracula: Do I what? Use country codes or now what es-419 is?
[16:35:06] <entuland> austincheney, you _need_ to show your actual code - if you're not keeping track of the subprocess returned by spawn() or you're not setting up the pipes, it's not going to work, so we need to know IF and HOW you're trying to access those streams
[16:35:26] <vdamewood> dracula: Use country codes? Yes. Know what es-419 is, not until I looked it up just now.
[16:36:02] <vdamewood> Arahael: I didn't even know they had special cases for non-political regions.
[16:36:33] <Arahael> vdamewood: It's always struck me as unusual.
[16:36:53] <austincheney> entuland, child_process.spawn("start chrome --user-data-dir=\"myFolderLocation\" --enable-logging --v=0 --no-first-run --no-default-browser-check --remote-debugging-port=0")
[16:36:56] <vdamewood> It makes sense to me, both that they would have special cases, and that the special cases would be numeric.
[16:37:29] <entuland> austincheney, there is no trace of setting the IO in that spawn() call
[16:37:29] <vdamewood> And as usual, Princess Meow Meow wants attention.
[16:37:56] <vdamewood> I would be embarrased if that were her real name, but her real name is much worse, Precious.
[16:38:06] <Arahael> vdamewood: Why does it make sense that it's numeric?
[16:38:13] <austincheney> entuland, when I execute that command the browsers create their own separate shell where they write their stdout and stderr
[16:38:20] <vdamewood> Arahael: To avoid collision with future political territories.
[16:38:42] <Arahael> vdamewood: Intriguing.
[16:38:54] <entuland> austincheney, when you invoke spawn() you can set up the IO with a _second_ param containing the IO setup to communicate with your main program
[16:39:05] <entuland> if you don't do that, it's no wonder you can't even try and check those IO channels
[16:39:24] <vdamewood> Arahael: Remember, when the codes were first drafted, there were no countries called ru, uk etc.
[16:39:31] <austincheney> yeah, spawn.stderr.on("data", function (data) {console.log(data)}), but it won't get anything

[16:51:16] <entuland> even if your code works on other OSes, you're not really using the spawn() function as intended, by stashing all the args in the command string
[16:51:59] <entuland> it may be good to refactor the code to provide the args separately, it may actually make your code cleaner as you won't have to worry about escaping / cleaning the string
[16:55:12] <entuland> as a personal preference, if you have to map a string onto another (say, "darwin" => "open", "win32" => "start") it's better to actually use such a map instead of those nested ternaries
[17:02:09] <StayHungry> sorry to interrupt you. i have a general question about syntax. having compared most popular scripting engines - https://dpaste.org/M3Zn/slim - the only language that speaks as i think is Javascript, its command is sequentially chained, second close is PowerShell, others are more or less Yoda-speaking, that nested constructions, especially in Python like '-'.lastaction(middleaction(firsaction(...))).
[17:02:16] <StayHungry> why is it so?
[17:03:33] <entuland> such languages have far more than just that simple case and they all have their own main intended target (to an extent) that affected the way they have been created along with their syntax
[17:03:56] <entuland> also, "speaks as I think" is really subjective
[17:04:20] <entuland> someone else may find other approaches more "natural" for their own way of thinking

[17:17:02] <entuland> eheeheh
[17:17:08] <entuland> I can sleep tonight
[17:17:22] <entuland> there are a ton of things affecting how such a task gets tackled by different programming languages even just for how string literals are handled - they're first class objects you can invoke methods on in JS, they're not so in PHP, for instance
[17:18:17] <StayHungry> actually we found there were only 3 ways to solve the task
[17:18:36] <StayHungry> split/reverse/join array, regex capture groups, date parsing
[17:18:46] *** Quits: inky_ (~inky@141.136.79.5) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)

[17:20:23] <entuland> I actually happen to "switch" mindset when dealing with JS or PHP knowing such things - in JS it's like reading the order of operations forward (split, reverse, join), in PHP is like diving into how you achieve each step: echo the implosion of the reverse of an explosion

[17:21:12] <StayHungry> yeah, i love javascript for that, it's like we speak in normal life (btw, ruby's command here would be the same)
[17:21:45] <StayHungry> unfortunately i dismissed ruby for being slow without switching off bundled gems (350ms to startup)
[17:22:02] <entuland> adding a split/explode or a join/implode version in Lua is trivial and you're totally fine creating such small helpers

[17:23:15] <oldlaptop> Different languages will generally have different organizing ideas for different audiences and purposes. Function composition of the f(g(x) sort is a sensible approach, for example (in your little paste, R and Tcl are arranged like that)

[17:24:26] <austincheney> how can I programmatically find the location of an application from the windows terminal, such as a browser?  "where chrome" doesn't work because chrome is not the path string
[17:25:22] <pulse> austincheney, you check where the program is installed?
[17:25:56] <pulse> i don't think you can do it any other way
[17:25:59] <oldlaptop> offhand, isn't the only way to do that to (shudders) trawl through the registry?
[17:26:00] <pulse> i could be wrong *shrug*
[17:26:14] <austincheney> pain
[17:26:37] <entuland> "start" is able to find "chrome" even if "chrome" per se can't be invoked directly, so there must be some facility that "start" uses to find it
[17:26:50] <entuland> you may need to check the MS docs for that
[17:26:56] <austincheney> will do
[17:26:59] <oldlaptop> Yes, pain and windows go together. This is what you signed up for, unfortunately

[17:28:46] <entuland> meh, just like pretty much all programming languages do the same stuff in different ways, all OSes have their pros/cons - there likely is no such a thing as a pain-free OS depending on what you want to do
[17:29:29] <StayHungry> austincheney: run from root of the drive -> dir /s /b php.exe
[17:29:34] <oldlaptop> most OSes do not have the Windows Registry, or anything quite that evil
[17:29:46] <oldlaptop> (even microsoft seems to regret that one nowadays)
[17:29:49] <pulse> no, they have config files, which are even more vile :p
[17:29:51] <StayHungry> austincheney: however it would take long, consider installing Everything (local search engine)
[17:30:16] <mrig> Whos idea was running the entire shebang from a registry?
[17:30:35] <mrig> Wondering where or rather when that dates back to.
[17:31:35] <pulse> fwiw austincheney if it's a system util "where" apparently works
[17:31:46] <pulse> "where ping" outputs "C:\Windows\System32\PING.EXE"
[17:32:03] <StayHungry> only if ping.exe is in path
[17:32:10] <pulse> ah, could be
[17:32:10] <oldlaptop> our querent appears to know all about that, and exactly why it isn't a useful answer
[17:32:47] <StayHungry> oldlaptop: speak further about scripting languages syntax, please
[17:33:30] <oldlaptop> StayHungry: the only one in there I really care about is tcl, which is quite weird in that respect
[17:33:38] <oldlaptop> (it doesn't have very much syntax)
[17:34:02] * austincheney cries tears of blood.  all I want to launch a browser by name and access its stderr output
[17:35:16] <StayHungry> put its path into variable set "_chromePath=C:\..." or $_chromePath='gc c:\....' and call further in your batch/ps1
[17:35:19] <pulse> austincheney, just put the chrome files in PATH?
[17:35:50] <entuland> they may want to automate it so that it works out of the box installing the program in any machine
[17:35:58] <oldlaptop> https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TclCmd/Tcl.html is the canonical, complete definition of the whole syntax, everything else (including control structures) is just commands
[17:36:17] <entuland> austincheney, I'm afraid you'll have to find out how start really does it's "magic" (likely a registry lookup)
[17:36:51] <StayHungry> austincheney: covid19 is raging and you compete with that drama by making much ado about chrome :D
[17:37:07] <oldlaptop> austincheney: Alas, I've carefully forgotten all the garbage I had to dig up about how you find this in the registry. It is in there, assuming your language/environment allows you to query the dratted thing
[17:37:26] * StayHungry is in Shakesperean mood today
[17:37:32] <entuland> austincheney, https://www.npmjs.com/package/locate-chrome
[17:37:41] <Lyn> should I use container(s) in deploying a website?
[17:37:43] <pulse> you know you can programatically add to PATH too right
[17:38:11] <oldlaptop> If you know what you need to add to PATH, you aren't asking this question in the first place.

[17:39:40] <entuland> as above, if the program is supposed to run on an arbitrary machine, they'll have to automate it somehow (the program they linked is also supposed to be cross platform)
[17:39:58] <StayHungry> oldlaptop: i like that tcl interpreters are quite portable and weights a few megabytes only, however am wonder how they compare with javascript for example. however i would surely prefer tcl over javascript because nodejs is a monster (hundreds of megabytes).

[22:17:38] <dracula> entuland: first of all that tab is not absolutely empty. secondly, if you actually have enabled user-agent stylesheets, it should be there. it's always there, even with a blank page.
[22:18:46] <entuland> how do I even get a completely empty tab?
[22:18:59] <entuland> ah, about:blank
[22:19:00] <dracula> entuland: you can get it from the appropriate settings.
[22:19:07] <entuland> let's try again
[22:20:33] <dracula> entuland: it should be like this. `https://i.ibb.co/q5v4cnW/hello.png`

[22:21:54] <entuland> https://i.imgur.com/die0v9M.png
[22:22:08] <dracula> entuland: while i know that it works in regular Firefox too, it's probably because you haven't enabled the settings properly or you're using a very old version, probably.

[22:47:10] <dracula> entuland: i change it to `AGENT_SHEET` to make it load as a user-agent stylesheet and it works.

[22:49:14] <entuland> I don't understand if you found a solution or not

[22:52:22] <entuland> dracula, you're welcome, but I can't help if I don't even know whether you _still_ want to find a solution or not
[22:52:46] <entuland> by now I guess that you don't have a solution and you don't know whether there is a solution and that you still are looking for a solution, but that's just a guess

[22:54:40] <dracula> entuland: i was hoping some bleeding edge Firefox user might give some hack, etc.
[22:55:06] <Akuli> Guest58, i was going to suggest itertools.groupby, but apparently it only works if all items of the same type are consecutively in the list
[22:55:38] <Guest58> Akuli So maybe sort then groupby?
[22:55:45] <Akuli> yeah that would work too
[22:55:53] <dracula> entuland: are there any other channels here for this kind of stuff? #firefox is useless, they are moved to Matrix or something.
[22:56:03] <Guest58> Akuli thank you, I am new to python :)
[22:56:21] <entuland> I noticed that highlighter.css uses variables, and those variables may be part of a theme you may be able to alter
[22:56:31] <entuland> something like this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/DevToolsColors
[22:57:15] <entuland> the theme may be able to override that variable used for the font size
[22:58:20] <dracula> entuland: that's all under the scope of `userContent.css`. user-agent stylesheets don't fall in that context as you yourself have observed with the tooltip.
