[01:08:16] <banshi> hello all
[01:09:41] <banshi> can someone share with me real documents about ufo published by wikileaks? And have Eddy Snowden ever mentioned something about ufos?
[01:10:14] <Noisytoot> I don't think this is the right channel to ask that
[01:10:40] <Noisytoot> but the answer is probably https://search.wikileaks.org/?q=ufo
[01:11:01] <joepublic> or, more broadly, https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ufo+documents
[01:11:21] <banshi> btw, what license do that documents use? FDL?
[01:12:00] <joepublic> unfortunately, the "real ufo documents" have not standardized on a single license, I don't think.
[01:12:22] <Noisytoot> wikileaks leaks documents, the copyright holders don't give a license to them

[01:21:17] <xodazuwe[m]> so what happens if a big tech engineer who's a whistleblower notices that a big tech company has shipped software with GPL in it. Does that mean that big tech corp will have to release all its source code that uses the library under GPL?
[01:22:04] <xodazuwe[m]> more likely outcome, big tech engineers rewrite the software to not use the GPL library, and lie to the authorities about never having used GPL software
[01:22:25] <xodazuwe[m]> I guess my question is is there legal precedent of this sort of action taken against big tech corp
[01:22:30] <joepublic> That's two eventual possibilities
[01:24:09] <xodazuwe[m]> to my knowledge, no big tech corp has ever been sued using GPL, and they have an army of lawyers that will make every step of your life miserable. but they are afraid of it I think. At Amazon and Microsoft, to my knowledge, developers are made to perform "Open Source Software License" reviews
[01:24:20] <xodazuwe[m]> and they are forced to not use anything with GPL
[01:25:06] <joepublic> these issues in practice are not so cut and dried, not so polarized.  
[01:25:57] <xodazuwe[m]> I only quote anecdotes of people who have worked at big corp and the overwhelming majority of pencil pushers at big tech don't care about software freedom

[06:22:40] <anton> so from an article I found it looks like it's just another Chromium browser
[06:23:04] <DiffieHellman> Yep.
[06:25:45] <anton> also https://vivaldi.com/blog/technology/why-isnt-vivaldi-browser-open-source/
[06:26:53] <anton> apart from already being admittingly nonfree, about 92% is just chromium with a huge 3% of their code being "open source" and 5% a proprietary ui(?) that isn't even that good
[06:27:32] <anton> I've never even heard about it before today
[06:29:33] <tpefreedom> Blink is admittedly a pretty good rendering engine. Too bad chromium isn't definitively free.
[06:29:51] <tpefreedom> It seems like no one can agree what exactly is free or not.
[06:29:54] *** Joins: dragestil_ (~quassel@user/dragestil)
[06:30:19] <DiffieHellman> Blink is only a good rendering engine compared to the other ones available. All current browser engines are just terrible.
[06:31:55] <joepublic> things like CSS and ECMAscript complicate things.
[06:34:13] <tpefreedom> That's what makes gemini pretty great. Pages are simple.
[06:34:56] <anton> gemini just feels a little too 'simple' to me

[06:36:56] <tpefreedom> But text-based browsers work great and it is more lightweight and effectively has accessibility built-in. All you need is a screen reader. No fxcking around with tags.
[06:38:54] <joepublic> so by being deliberately broken (missing essential features) for displaying web pages, things are simplified.  Several browsers take this approach.
[06:39:22] <tpefreedom> Is anyone working on a truly fsdg-compliant app store for phones?
[06:39:44] <joepublic> what operating system would it run on?
[06:39:51] <anton> ^
[06:40:34] <DiffieHellman> tpefreedom: Already done - f-droid for android devices. Sadly Android doesn't work without nonfree software
[06:40:56] <tpefreedom> Doesn't some of the software in f-droid suggest nonfree software?
[06:41:14] <tpefreedom> Like clients for the google play store.
[06:45:05] <DiffieHellman> It has software that suggests nonfree services and some have nonfree fonts etc, but f-droid reports each and every piece of software that does. You can probably write a patch that won't show any of these.

[20:27:32] <kilobug> xx: the best way is probably to have a look at how an official GNU program does it, and do the same
[20:27:37] <bandali> xx, you should not make any changes to the copy of the gplv3 license. instead, do as it says, by adding the notice to individual header files

[20:28:31] <jaket23> Is there any news on the FSF github white papers yet?
[20:28:37] <bandali> right. no the license file itself should not be changed
[20:28:46] <xx> whether it is stated anywhere directly to not fill out that part

[20:56:33] <user9> craigt: hi I have a couple more questions that have come up. So far all I have been doing to verify crypto donation status is to go to a project's website and look for donation info there. I've thought about going further and contacting different projects but haven't done that at this point. I see, though, that the project 3dldf has Accepts Cryptocurrency Donations=Yes, but they don't appear to have a website
[20:56:35] <user9> and I'm just unsure exactly how it's known that they accept crypto. The answer to that question should help me determine what steps I should take to determine whether a project accepts crypto, if that makes sense.

[21:44:50] <adfeno_> Hi there
[21:45:24] <user9> craigt: it looks like the "entry details" section has yet to be  created on a number of projects. If there's a template or a particular entry I should use for a template, I can go back and add that section to the projects I've looked at so far
[21:45:32] <user9> adfeno: hi
[21:46:02] <craigt> adfeno_: Hi!
[21:47:37] *** davisr_ is now known as davisr
[21:47:40] <adfeno_> What's up?
[21:48:19] <craigt> adfeno_: Not much, user9 and I were just looking at the crypto/donation setting.
[21:48:38] <adfeno_> Ah I see.
[21:49:24] <adfeno_> user9: I did not forget about the bug you found, I just have not found a place for it on the schedule.
[21:50:01] <adfeno_> I'll talk to other admins to see what can be done, since it needs server-side mass modification.
[21:50:36] <user9> adfeno: no problem. I noticed that the number of entries that comes back seems to match pretty closely the number of gnu projects if that helps anything

[21:59:40] <craigt> adfeno_: The crypto setting seems to be in two places for some entries. One under the Entry and the other under EntryDetails. The EntryDetails is the one that changes what is displayed for the entry.
[21:59:43] *** Joins: lisp123 (~lisp123@5.30.23.247)
[22:00:59] <adfeno_> Indeed. Whatever happened during the move from Entry to EntryDetails actually duplicated the definition.
[22:05:08] <user9> adfeno_: should all projects have an EntryDetails section? Some don't seem to at all.
[22:06:39] <craigt> user9: Because 3dldf is GNU, it would be helpful to reach out to them to clarify. I could not find anything about crypto on the website: https://www.gnu.org/software/3dldf/ But it looks like the maintainer recently restarted working on the project.
[22:08:13] <user9> craigt: sure I'll email them for clarification (and hope my email doesn't go to spam)
[22:08:25] <adfeno_> user9: unfortunatelly not all of them have. According to the tabs on the entry form, they should, but back when the submission form was just all in one tab, it had almost everything there but the form was big. So we decided to make the form tabbed, but so far we did not manage to find a way for the tabbed content to use only one template.

[22:17:50] *** Quits: Guest76 (~Guest76@generic.nshealth.ca) (Quit: Client closed)
[22:23:39] <user9> adfeno_: hmmm, that makes updating projects difficult I think. Is/was that a manual process to add EntryDetails? I ask because in order to update "Accepts crypto donations" I need an EntryDetails section to add it to.

[22:28:30] * craigt is reviewing at https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Argos_Translate
[22:28:34] <adfeno_> The form itself has it, it's the "Etc" tab.
[22:29:43] <adfeno_> But I do agree that either the form is not filling the value to the right setter template, or the display/print template is not getting the right value.
[22:30:01] <user9> adfeno_: so does that mean that if I were to go and edit with forms, like any edit, would that add the EntryDetails section to the project? Because when you go into just edit (without forms) the section is just not there.
[22:30:20] <user9> but it's there in edit on 3dldf
[22:30:49] <adfeno_> user9: Yes, "Edit with form" is the way to go, at least for *setting the metadata*. For displaying however, other investigation has to be made.
[22:31:49] <user9> adfeno_ okay I'll do that. I'm not sure my question was clear but a test will answer for sure
[22:32:28] <adfeno_> user9: I'll try to find a way to make a list of entries that do not have the "accept crypto" field.
