[03:12:46] <bewees> i have two computers permanently serially connected, is this a bad idea in terms of security? I think it's comparable to passworded SSH but safer, as it's in intranet. So adding a failed-pam login restriction should be good enough?

[03:39:22] <shibboleth> exactly, so unless he's always physically present at one of the two there's very little to gain by the serial copnnection
[03:39:32] <bewees> well if they're connected to upstream anyways and accessible via ssh, then I could add an ssh server in their initramfs (provided that works with 2FA nitrokey) - should be not much diference

[15:58:29] <viq|w> soulisson: "what happens if an attacker somehow manages to make a user to authorize some app" is a known attack against oauth based services. Or not displaying fully / user ignoring permissions requested. For example that's why google advises to regularly go over the list of authorized apps and remove those you don't need/use/recognize
[16:01:39] <soulisson> viq|w, ok, but this not the protection here. Here it protects the clietn app, not the resource server

[16:17:35] <soulisson> I can think of a case. Let's say that the client application is a freelance website that rely on Oauth for bank account information, to ransfert found to the freelancer. I guess an attacker if there was not this protection could manage to add his own banking information to the victim's account and get paid instead.

[20:13:35] <TimMc> Ginger beer is nice. Root beer can be pretty good too, But it's definitely a once-in-a-while thing for me.
[20:13:39] <calmclam> oh it is very addictive
[20:14:40] <calmclam> they still use coca leaves in coke, they're the only company legally allowed to import it into the US
[20:15:21] <soulisson> calmclam, at one point, I was drinking a can every day. I guess it was a way to feel better because of my mother's sickness.
[20:16:24] <calmclam> heh one can is downright minimal by american standards
[20:16:32] <TimMc> calmclam: And I've heard that the cocaine alkaloid that they remove is actually used medically.
[20:17:09] <calmclam> soulisson: I know people who only drink soda. As in, it's the only liquid they drink. Other than alcohol.
[20:17:14] <TimMc> (I've also heard that a tea made from coca leaves is no more stimulating or addictive than coffee, which, to be fair, is kind of a low bar.)
[20:17:41] <soulisson> calmclam, lmao, yeah? I guess one in a while is not too bad but every day, man.

[20:18:14] <calmclam> TimMc: I feel like in the US it's not all that unusual
[20:19:28] <flyback> The US government has filed a superseding indictment against Paige A. Thompson, a former Amazon engineer accused of hacking Capital One and stealing the personal data of more than 100 million Americans. From a report:
[20:19:28] <flyback> According to court documents filed earlier this month and obtained by The Record, the US Department of Justice has added seven new charges on top of the original two it filed in August 2019. The new charges -- six counts of computer fraud and abuse, and one count of access device fraud -- come as investigators have made headway in analyzing data seized from Thompson's computers and servers.
[20:19:31] <flyback> DUAH
[20:19:34] <flyback> what a fucking idiot
[20:19:36] <calmclam> I'll pass on the coca tea tho, just two cups of coffee makes me jittery
[20:20:11] <TimMc> I've only ever had two cups of coffee, and only then in the past year or so.
[20:20:22] <TimMc> Definitely not going to have more.

[20:20:42] <TimMc> I still haven't tried alcohol, either, beyond a sip.
[20:20:53] <calmclam> alcohol is an acquired taste too

[21:25:39] <raccoon_dog> I mean, if they're going to prevent people from taking a pentesting course because the knowledge is "dangerous", chemistry degrees should also be outlawed.
[21:26:50] <electr0n> most online proctoring firms are moving away from AI (software) only solutions to more human centric one.
[21:27:36] <electr0n> calmclam: that is not being treated like a terrorist at all.
[21:28:06] <raccoon_dog> Well, that's why I asked what the exact rationale was. Asking to have your webcam turned on may be fair enough.
[21:28:13] <raccoon_dog> But I was curious what being denied the course itself was about.
[21:28:30] <MadCamel> I think the real solution is to change the way tests are designed. There's ways to demonstrate deeper knowledge than a cheat sheet could help with.

[23:30:09] <VIA> well its linux of course. and yea its pinning rust?
[23:30:44] <VIA> from my understanding of SSD it nearly impossible to recover anything if deleted overwritten cause the way data is stored/whole sectors or blocks r pushed

[23:32:15] <VIA> hmhh photorec looks good, i have tried similar programs on win i think, and what bothered me is that it looks for specific files which id have to specify cause im looking for anything
[23:32:30] <VIA> but i do understand it makes more sense than not looking for specific files
