[00:15:56] <tusko> Friends, help me out. I need to get a copy of https://www.iso.org/standard/54531.html
[00:16:29] <sarnold>     64-bit block ciphers: TDEA, MISTY1, CAST-128, HIGHT;
[00:16:29] <sarnold>     128-bit block ciphers: AES, Camellia, SEED.
[00:16:48] <sarnold> I have to wonder what kind of archaelogy you're doing :) heh
[00:19:29] <tusko> AES
[00:19:38] <tusko> Its still used lol
[00:20:37] <sarnold> tusko: how about this? try the 'local download' link on https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/197/final
[00:21:30] <tusko> The thing is that deosn't seem to cover any of the modes
[00:21:49] <sarnold> ahhh
[00:21:57] <tusko> The best it offers is some of the functions for a general AES described in Figure 5
[00:29:17] <tusko> seems like CBC

[04:17:32] <rk4> i like to think ciphers aren't designed on such shakey underpinnings [at least until they hit reality and have to be implemented!]
[04:18:02] <ms7821> it is true that ciphers that get little attention are often easily broken

Say i have a website, and i am publishing a software, i sign it and ppl can download and verify using my public key. NOW my website gets comromised, an attacker creates a new package, signs it with its FAKE name which is mine and publishes his key too on the website. Now ppl download it and verigfy it all good.

[12:27:44] <river> pagios: the issue here is the security of pgp is only as good as the key distribution
[12:27:58] <river> so you are as well to just host the file itself, unsigned
[12:28:13] <river> unless there is an alternative channel where people can get the key - like a pgp keyserver
[12:29:13] <maroon> unsigned? then what's the advantage in publishing a key for something that's not signed?
[12:29:27] <river> im saying its equivalent to not having a key at all
[12:30:16] <maroon> ok that's true, an un-authenticated key has 100% of the value of a no-key

[13:04:24] <pagios> so what is the point of PGP here
[13:13:53] <river> well that's what im saying
[13:13:57] <river> there's no point*
[13:14:09] <river> (* there is some marginal utility in doing this)
[13:14:33] <piou> for ubuntu it makes sense
[13:14:42] <piou> for a lone website, less so
[13:16:36] <piou> if your package distribution strategy is to let many people run servers that provide your packages for you you need a way for people to verify that these packages are legitimate. It's easier for ubuntu to say "Hey, anyone can provide the packages, we'll provide a reference list of signatures so that people can check it's really the package we intended to provide"
[13:17:11] <piou> Also avoid relying on HTTPS which is pretty much ubiquitous nowadays but haven't always been so
[13:20:16] *** Joins: PJBoy (~PJBoy@user/pjboy)
[13:20:46] <piou> For a lone developper... I guess that allows people to provide the package "the ubuntu way" rather than increasing the main website load but I don't see many people doing that. If I were a distribution interested in that software however I would probably notice and refuse packages after an unexpected key change.
[13:21:35] <piou> Still, it sounds better to leave the possibility to be able to notice a key change rather than not providing a way to authenticate the package at all

[15:28:03] <pulseaudio> yeah
[15:30:40] <maroon> well, i know during the war there were several versions of it. it started out with 3 rotors and later was upgraded to 4 rotors
[15:32:08] <maroon> the big downfall, pun intended, was that it was like a stream cipher that couldn't encrypt plaintext into the same ciphertext character, in effect a stream that didn't contain the 0x00 byte. so if they could know parts of the plaintext, they could eliminate invalid keys because the ciphertext also had the expected letter at that same position
[15:33:05] <maroon> there was one point in the war where keys were groups of 2 3-letter codes, and one of the german officers was a fan of the hollywood actor 'tom mix' so that was the key for one of the days

[15:46:10] <ms7821> probably just pressing buttons? it worked like a keyboard
[15:47:18] <ms7821> it was intended as field-usable crypto equipment in an era when typewriters were cutting edge
