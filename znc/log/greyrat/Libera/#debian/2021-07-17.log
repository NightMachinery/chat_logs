[00:36:59] <coconut> Any logic reason for why debian never got rollback feature in apt/apt-get ?
[00:37:42] <ratrace> coconut: are you talking about downgrade?
[00:38:09] <coconut> no rollback of packages after apt upgrade
[00:38:14] <DHE> you mean an undo when an apt job goes sideways?
[00:39:08] <coconut> going to previous versions with apt actually
[00:39:26] <ratrace> so you ARE talking about downgrade :)
[00:39:28] <jmcnaught> Debian packages are more than archives of files, they have scripts that are executed.  Downgrading means reversing the effects of those scripts too
[00:39:56] <ratrace> that. and for some packages that'd be near impossible
[00:40:07] <zaggynl> eh, maybe use btrfs and snapper
[00:40:32] <ratrace> that's one excellent way to protect against upgrade fubar
[00:40:45] <zaggynl> just lacking the grub roll back then
[00:41:15] <DHE> or ZFS. :)
[00:41:28] <zaggynl> :o, that actually is in repo, grub-btrfs
[00:42:01] <ratrace> I think that's something entirely different
[00:42:18] <coconut> i asked because yum does can do rollback upgrades
[00:42:22] <greycat> another excellent way to protect against apt-get screwing your system is to run stable
[00:42:32] <ratrace> hm, no it's not, it IS about snapshot support in grub. neat.
[00:42:50] <ratrace> greycat: until stable screws up your system too :)
[00:43:08] <zaggynl> am suggesting it as im on opensuse tw, have had to use it after some upgrades
[00:43:35] <ratrace> coconut: those package managers don't do the same things, if they were, they wouldn't be able to downgrade either

[00:48:15] <ratrace> coconut: why's taht weird? they don' do the same thing. debian has post inst scripts and steps and auto(re)starts services

[00:48:45] *** Joins: hejux (~hejux@104.224.190.144.16clouds.com)
[00:49:20] <coconut> true
[00:49:35] <ratrace> coconut: one example is update of etc files. new versions bring new config options, and you're asked to merge them with your local changes. if you rolled back, you can't rollback the etc config, and would end up unable to run the program due to erroneous config entries.
[00:50:30] <greycat> a less common example would be binary database files that are converted to a new format upon an upgrade
[00:51:16] <coconut> interesting
[00:51:20] <ratrace> or that. or filesystem rearchitecting like usrmerge
[00:52:32] *** thegodsquirrel is now known as thegodsq-
[00:56:47] <greycat> it wouldn't be impossible to design a package system that does what dpkg does, and also permits single-level rollbacks, but you'd have to design it for this from the beginning

[01:04:53] <greycat> !override dns
[01:04:54] <dpkg> To have dhclient etc not touch /etc/resolv.conf, the best plan is to configure it not to touch that file. See https://wiki.debian.org/resolv.conf for more details. Note that by ignoring the DHCP-provided DNS servers, you may find that you are unable to use captive portals or surf the web on some network. Beware creating technical debt by doing things like chattr +i

[13:49:27] <NiLon> not every dev wants to submit their module to kernel and/or it got declined to be part of for some reason
[13:50:06] <NiLon> also there are some benefits for it being separate as it doesn't follow kernel update cycle so you could have more up-to-date module for older kernel
[13:51:01] <xx> https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback/issues/268
[13:51:04] <xx> I think that's it
[13:51:09] <xx> so no fault of debian
[13:51:37] <xx> anyone know if it is safe to use?
[13:51:51] <NiLon> what you mean by safe?
[13:52:07] <xx> will it set my computer on fire?
[13:52:50] <NiLon> likely not, you can always disable it if it causes a problem
[13:56:35] <rudi_s> Of course it's a kernel module, so it can do (almost) anything with your computer if it wants to.

[23:25:03] <zeamp> After hosting panel DirectAdmin announced it's dropping FreeBSD support, I migrated my last FreeBSD version to Debian. I was a FreeBSD user since 3.x (late 1990s) up until 12.2. Now currently on Debian 10 (4.9 kernel). Any tips you can offer an old *BSD admin? Besides trying to love systemd? ;-)

[23:35:57] <sussudio> is directadmin a fork of that vulnerability-ridden webmin thing?

[23:37:00] <jhutchins> zeamp: Why are you using DirectAdmin?
[23:38:25] <zeamp> jhutchins: I have a couple email heavy clients that need a super-duper simple web GUI to manage quotas, passwords, etc. Webmin has always been too clunky/ugly for their grasping, even with a custom theme. They've been on DA since it existed.
[23:38:47] <zeamp> 2001, if I recall.
[23:39:00] <sussudio> looks like directadmin hasn't been updated since 2019.
[23:39:01] <zeamp> I think they've also used the rest of them: cPanel, Plesk, Cobalt RaQ, Ensim.
[23:39:24] <zeamp> DirectAdmin gets weekly updates. Its website was stuck in 2001 since just recently.
[23:39:34] <zeamp> They were forced to "catch up" to the rest of the market when cPanel was bought out.
[23:39:37] <jhutchins> zeamp: Sounds like a solid use case.
[23:40:06] <zeamp> It's one of those they're programmers not graphic designers kind of thing, but their theme is always a few notches higher than Webmin.
[23:40:30] <sussudio> "Stable release : 1.59.1 / September 25, 2019 ; 21 months ago"
[23:40:45] <zeamp> Before that, we were using Cobalt RaQ plugins, and we were I think the last corporate customer on Ensim Control Panel (1998?).
[23:40:58] <jhutchins> zeamp: Webmin is a really horrible system.

[23:41:15] <zeamp> sussudio: DirectAdmin-- https://directadmin.com/versions.php
[23:41:45] <zeamp> jhutchins: I've used it on and off for real basic tasks since around the late 90s.
[23:42:01] <zeamp> It's hit or miss, I hate it, nobody I know loves it, but it does some things okay.
[23:42:53] <jhutchins> I had to admin a system that used it.  What a mess.  It stores it's configuration modifications in it's own, non-obvious files, so when something breaks the system configuration and the webmin configuration are out-of-sync, and it's really difficult to recover.
[23:43:56] <zeamp> But in two clicks, an AOL user can change his work email password without calling tech support.
