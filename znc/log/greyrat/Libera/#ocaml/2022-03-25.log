[01:02:09] <companion_cube> I wonder what's the limit of linux
[01:02:17] <companion_cube> how big a buffer it can fill in one go, in practice
[01:03:15] <d_bot> <RegularSpatula> sleepydog: for reference https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/62e177a7f002e4352f18710e29813db3889ae05a/otherlibs/unix/read.c#L27
[01:03:22] <sleepydog> yea i just read that
[01:03:54] <d_bot> <mbacarella> IIRC Linux will fill an arbitrarily large read buffer if it's from a file
[01:04:56] <companion_cube> if it's in cache? or will it really wait to have read the whole file?
[01:05:30] <d_bot> <mbacarella> I *think* so? I tested this once about ten years ago and the surprising thing happened
[01:05:55] <sleepydog> there has to be a limit. it's probably very specific to what your file descriptor actually references (socket, pipe, file, /dev/zero, etc)
[01:06:41] <companion_cube> yeah that's what I'm wondering
[01:06:53] <companion_cube> like, surely you can't fill 500MB in one syscall? :D
[01:07:42] <d_bot> <mbacarella> why not?
[01:08:26] <sleepydog> you can make a tcp socket buffer as large as you want.I  don't know if you'll be allowed to drain it with one read(), though
[01:10:07] <companion_cube> @mbacarella: idk, it seems… preposterous :D
[01:10:26] <companion_cube> there's no kernel internal structure that is bounded?

[01:22:02] <sleepydog> ah wait, that's 1MB, haha
[01:22:03] <companion_cube> :D daaamn
[01:25:51] <sleepydog> yea, i can do 1GB. trying to go higher but getting compiler warnings, heh
[01:27:00] <sleepydog> ok, for /dev/zero, limit appears to be 2GB
[01:28:21] <sleepydog> for a pipe setup by the shell with no extra tweaks, it's 64KB

[02:15:58] <QDX45> Hey. I'm getting an error while compiling a package with opam. I'm getting an alert that a function is depreciated, and so far as I can tell, that depreciation alert is making the compilation fail.
[02:17:00] <QDX45> Is there a way to prevent a depreciation alert from stopping an opam package installation? If it helps, it says 'terminated with error 10'.
[02:17:25] <octachron> which package?
[02:17:27] <QDX45> Sorry if this isn't the right place for an opam question. Not totally sure how closely related ocaml and opam are.
[02:17:45] <QDX45> xapi
[02:18:15] <QDX45> The problem is in compiling systemd.1.2, which is a dependency of the xapi package
[02:18:55] <QDX45> I don't mean to ask for a lot of support here, since it's a different piece of software. It's just my first time working with ocaml
[02:19:16] <QDX45> Just hoping for a pointer in the right direction
[02:19:31] *** Joins: wyrd (~wyrd@gateway/tor-sasl/wyrd)
[02:20:22] <octachron> xapi-stdext-threads on 4.14 ?
[02:21:24] <octachron> The generic answer is that deprecation alerts are normally not compilation error on release build, but some package insists to promote those alerts into errors
[02:22:29] <QDX45> Thanks. The generic answer is what I was hoping for. Is there a way for me to override that behavior and prevent the promotion?
[02:22:40] <octachron> Or did you mean that it is systemd.1.2 which is failing?
[02:23:15] <QDX45> The build hierarchy is fairly deep. The failure occurs while trying to compile systemd.1.2
[02:23:46] <octachron> No, if it is the package build system that insists to have paranoiac build default, you can only patch this default in the package/library
[02:24:32] <QDX45> Ok. Any pointers where I can look for that, or what the switch would look like?
[02:24:38] <octachron> ocaml-systemd builds on all OCaml version except 5.0 ?
[02:25:59] <octachron> It will be a a flag "-w ..." settings in the dune file of the project
[02:27:13] <QDX45> It's just listed as " "systemd" {>= "1.2"} " in the depends section of the opam file
[02:27:27] <QDX45> But that flag sounds like what I"m looking for.
[02:27:29] <QDX45> Thanks
[02:30:14] <octachron> There is no "systemd" package in the opam repository? And the ocaml-systemd package build fine on the opam CI across all released OCaml versions.
[02:33:09] <QDX45> I don't know where it's pulling systemd from. Could be straight from https://github.com/systemd/systemd for all I can tell.
[02:33:54] <QDX45> This is the thing I'm trying to build: https://github.com/xapi-project/xen-api
[02:34:46] <QDX45> It's just weird. Thanks for your help; you answered my question. Found the -w flag, though it turns out it's not the issue. Probably misread the log.
[02:35:35] <octachron> It is using its own opam-repository: xs-opam according to the readme

[03:02:54] <QDX45> I'll probably have to alter the code, since the idea is to get it working on alpine linux which uses a different init system than what xapi depends on
[03:03:52] <d_bot> <undu> That's going to be a tremendous effort
[03:04:17] <d_bot> <undu> It depends deeply on systemd's service files

[03:09:35] <d_bot> <undu> The ocaml daemons are all started by service files

[19:16:42] <d_bot> <darrenldl> i used to use alpine image and install opam etc to build a static binary, but wonder if i was doing extraneous work
[19:22:43] <d_bot> <Et7f3 (@me on reply)> I think it is still a used workflow
[19:25:18] <sleepydog> i haven't tried it yet, but when i eventually need this i will try to use anmonteiro's Nix-based approach in https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/cross-compiling-implementations-how-they-work/8686/2
[19:26:24] <d_bot> <RegularSpatula> I still use an alpine image with GH actions. That alpine image is also built with a GH action
[19:27:01] <d_bot> <darrenldl> icic, thanks for the comments!

[21:26:21] <d_bot> <Frisk> Sam, the bots are bridged messages from IRC
[21:26:50] <d_bot> <Sam> What is irc
[21:27:16] <companion_cube> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat a protocol probably older than you :)

[21:49:09] <d_bot> <mbacarella> It's this app like discord but it only consumes 10MB of RAM instead of 1GB
[21:49:38] <companion_cube> it's a lot more primitive than discord
[21:50:03] <companion_cube> but also, federated, open source, and it's easy to do bots from scratch without proprietary web APIs
[21:51:16] <d_bot> <mbacarella> oh, and it's difficult to use on smartphones because it requires a tcp connection to stay open the entire time
[21:51:46] <companion_cube> I have a weechat relay, it's not that bad
[21:51:56] <companion_cube> that said you do need more setup.
[21:52:35] <companion_cube> but weechat takes 27MB on my VPS, and my bot takes… 4MB of ram
[21:53:25] <Corbin> I'm using catgirl, taking up about 9MB of RAM.

[22:05:23] <d_bot> <VPhantom> @companion_cube My first decent C project on my Amiga in the 1990s, in fact, was an IRC bot. It's just a simple text protocol; barely any different on the wire than in the UI.
[22:07:32] <companion_cube> yeah
[22:07:36] <companion_cube> these days you need TLS though
