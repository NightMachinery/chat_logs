[00:04:28] <joel135> i was thinking a bit about the possibility of creating a constructive logic in which (forall a. a->a) = the monoid of knots (instead of the conventional answer '1'). when specialized to a = Set this gives a map from set to set, which is why i asked

[01:01:31] <mycroftiv> joel135: so there is an algebraic connection via left self-distributive algebras between rank-into-rank large cardinal self-embeddings of set models and type III reidemeister move on knots
[01:03:21] <mycroftiv> as well as connections between nonstandard models of arithmetic and exotic smoothness related to slice knots - so this idea that there is a correspondence between knot-tying processes and different logical spaces has come up before
[01:04:55] <joel135> slice knots seem cool
[01:05:07] <mycroftiv> it sounds like you have a totally different angle into these things but given the role of the identity type as homotopy path in type theory, making the identity function into knots somehow seems amazing
[01:06:25] <[itchyjunk]> mycroftiv, how come you dont hang around in programming channel so people can bug you with programming questions?
[01:06:31] <joel135> left self-distributive algebra -- that is the same as the notion of quandle i think
[01:07:01] <mycroftiv> [itchyjunk]: I stopped doing all my plan 9 operating systems work to do pure math in agda for the past few years
[01:08:23] <mycroftiv> joel135: yes, interesting work on this such as https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~lebed/Lebed_ATS14.pdf
[01:09:32] <[itchyjunk]> oh you do adga? very cool
[01:09:42] <mycroftiv> [itchyjunk]: i now regard putting so much of my life into understanding random ancient unix C libraries and such to have been probably a bit off-target, when i was trying to understand mathematics of music 20 years ago nobody pointed me to homology

[01:10:31] <joel135> rank-into-rank large cardinal self-embeddings of set models -- i am looking this up on wikipedia right now. is this stipulated embedding the same thing as an exact functor?
[01:10:34] <[itchyjunk]> maybe they did point it but it was a homotopic path

[01:10:56] <[itchyjunk]> mycroftiv, no. i think last time you posted that link was when this channel was in freenode?
[01:12:02] <mycroftiv> [itchyjunk]: i was gone for a few months during the transition, i returned kind of recently because i got very interested in 4 manifold topology and from there algebraic topology and homological algebra
[01:12:14] <[itchyjunk]> ah i see
[01:12:30] <[itchyjunk]> have you read that one HoTT book "evevryone" keeps talking about?
[01:12:51] <mycroftiv> sure ive read a lot of hott book, its kinda not my favorite presentation of the concepts
[01:13:16] <mycroftiv> http://wiki.9gridchan.org/incoming/mycro/agdahtml/CubicUnivalence.html is me doing univalent math in cubical type theory to explore all that
[01:13:39] <joel135> homotopy type theory -- yes, and if you want you could replace (forall a. a -> a) by (forall a. a = a)
[01:14:37] <mycroftiv> joel135: the idea that making one of these crazy exact functors involves creating a different computational interpretation of the equality is deeply sensible based on the analogy with how ultrapowers in set theory work
[01:15:08] <mycroftiv> because the way the ultrafilter and the identity function interact is why the large cardinals become the critical point of the embedding
[01:16:07] <joel135> fascinating. i wish i knew this stuff. could you explain more the significance of the identity function?
[01:16:36] *** Quits: netpipe (~netpipe@user/netpipe) (Quit: Client closed)
[01:16:37] <joel135> or how it is used
[01:16:46] <mycroftiv> in type theory, the essence of what happened going from base Martin-Löf type theory to univalent homotopty type theory is realizing you can have different interpretations of the identity type
[01:17:13] <joel135> yes, without "axiom K"
[01:17:24] <mycroftiv> and in large cardinal embeddings in set theory, the identity function marks the 'first ordinal moved' because of some fairly technical things involving the mostowski collapse and ultrapowers
[01:17:41] <mycroftiv> the measurable cardinal k 'becomes the identity function' after the model embedding
[01:19:08] <mycroftiv> so producing a whole spectrum of variant models by providing a parameterized way to implement the identity type is an idea ive been trying to work out already

[03:56:38] <PlanckWalk> (For that matter, also if by 0 you mean true)
[03:57:15] <[itchyjunk]> okay so how do i verify law of absorption above? i seem to be stuck.
[03:57:23] <PlanckWalk> What axioms are you given?
[03:57:30] <PlanckWalk> Can you use truth tables?
[03:57:36] <[itchyjunk]> i made a truth table for P,Q, (P and Q), P or (P and Q)
[03:57:53] <[itchyjunk]> i have no restriction, i was just trying to refresh some descrete math stuff
[03:58:15] <[itchyjunk]> i get 2 true and 2 false for P or ( P and Q) column
[03:58:37] <[itchyjunk]> when P is true and when both P and Q is true
[03:58:41] <[itchyjunk]> oh..
[03:58:52] <[itchyjunk]> anytime when P is true, P or (P and Q) is true
[03:58:53] <[itchyjunk]> is that why?
[03:59:07] <PlanckWalk> You should see that the columns in the table are identical
[03:59:20] <[itchyjunk]> yes i just not noticed that
[03:59:36] <[itchyjunk]> for some reason, i was expecting all of that last column to have trues ;_;
[04:00:08] <[itchyjunk]> another question, i don't understand the last column here : https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=P+or+%28P+and+Q%29+%3D%3E+P
[04:00:49] <PlanckWalk> It's using "=>" as a connective
[04:01:13] <[itchyjunk]> hmmm
[04:01:35] <PlanckWalk> When it comes to propositional logic there's a very close relation between implication and derivability
[04:02:32] <PlanckWalk> "P or (P and Q) => P" can mean either an expression in the language, or a statement that the RHS is derivable from the LHS.
[04:03:15] <PlanckWalk> If interpreted as an expression in the language, then it's a tautology.
[04:04:08] <[itchyjunk]> oh. expression is not always derivable then?
[04:04:19] <[itchyjunk]> so an axiom can be an expression?
[04:04:27] <PlanckWalk> Derivability depends upon what axioms and inference rules you have
[04:04:48] <[itchyjunk]> ah, so their truth table is based on treating the expression as tautology?
[04:05:04] <PlanckWalk> It's based on treating what you entered as a boolean expression.
[04:05:31] <PlanckWalk> The last column being all "T" means that the expression is a tautology
[04:06:23] <[itchyjunk]> oh i think i get what you mean
[04:06:48] <[itchyjunk]> i am telling it blah => blah and its generating the results based on that
[04:06:54] * [itchyjunk] facepalm
[04:07:03] <PlanckWalk> However, if you have something called a "Law of Absorption", I wouls expect it to be a statement about derivations.
[04:07:42] <PlanckWalk> "Laws" usually mean something you can use in proofs.
[04:08:16] <[itchyjunk]> Ah, so I should be able to start with LHS and get RHS based on a few assumption. So in that case, what would i need? i can get `P or (P and Q) => (P or P) and (P and Q) by distributivity => P an (P and Q) by idopotent law => ? "
[04:08:45] <PlanckWalk> So it all really depends upon the context

[04:09:58] <PlanckWalk> Given the name "Law of Absorption" I would expect it to be saying that if you have an expression of the form  P or (P and Q),  then you can derive the expression  P.

[04:10:21] <[itchyjunk]> Hmm, I can't seem to derive it though :<
[04:10:28] <PlanckWalk> What axioms do you have?
[04:11:16] <PlanckWalk> Pretty much every text uses different sets of axioms and inference rules for propositional logic.  They're all equivalent of course, but it makes it difficult to answer questions outside that context.

[04:20:24] <Galois> isn't "P or (P and Q) = P" just literally one of the absorption laws on that page?
[04:20:36] <PlanckWalk> Yes, it is
[04:20:52] <PlanckWalk> That's why I'd like to see an exact statement of the problem
[04:21:16] <Galois> if the problem is to derive the statement from the axioms on that page, it's a one step derivation. Cite the first absorption law.
[04:21:42] <[itchyjunk]> PlanckWalk, no it's not a problem ;_;. i just mistakenly thought i could reduce lhs to rhs via simplification
[04:21:50] <PlanckWalk> It's also not possible to derive the absorption laws from the other laws.
[04:22:33] <PlanckWalk> You can verify it with a truth table or something, and one of the exercises in the book asks about doing that with some of the other laws.

[17:46:25] <isekaijin> A function f : R -> R is upper semicontinuous if, for any convergent decreasing sequence x_n, we have lim_n f(x_n) = f(lim_n x_n). Seems good?
[17:46:53] <dauggy> right, that's the definition
[17:47:30] *** Joins: gateway2000 (~gateway20@cpe-172-100-180-15.stny.res.rr.com)
[17:47:39] <isekaijin> Okay, now, a subset X of R is closed if, for any convergent sequence x_n in X, the limit lim_n x_n is also in X.
[17:48:38] <isekaijin> So let f be the indicator function of X.
[17:48:50] <isekaijin> And let x_n be any convergent decreasing sequence in X.
[17:49:00] <isekaijin> Then f(x_n) = 1 for every index n.
[17:49:55] <isekaijin> So lim_n f(x_n) = 1 as well.
[17:50:03] <isekaijin> On the other hand, since X is closed, lim_n x_n is also in X.
[17:50:32] <isekaijin> Errr, sorry. I got my definition of upper semicontinuity wrong, it seems.
[17:50:34] <cherim> Looks like nonsense to me
[17:50:48] <isekaijin> Yeah.
[17:51:05] <cherim> First of all, it would be hard to prove with this definition for X={0} and x_n = 1/n

[17:56:19] <isekaijin> Okay, then the indicator function of a closed subset of R obviously satisfies condition (3) from that list.
[17:56:24] <cherim> If x is in R\X, then it's in R\X with some neighborhood V since R\X is open, and f is identically zero on V. f is even continuous at x.  If x is in X, then f(x)=1>=f(y) for any y in the anyway, anything is upper semicontinuous at maximum.

[18:54:06] <Simplar> My question here is...
[18:54:54] <Simplar> If the probability of one vending machine being left without coffee is 0.3, then the probabilities for first and second machines to be left with no coffee are equal

[20:36:05] <Z-module> If 0 <= t < 1, then the interval  (t, +infty) contains 1 but not 0, so f^-1 that interval is all the x with f(x) = 1, which is the set A.
