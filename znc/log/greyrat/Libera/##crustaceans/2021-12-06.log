[07:10:45] <buttsbot> You have to give it to the military - they really succeed in indoctrinating thei... | Hacker News
[07:17:27] <imode> "Everyone who leaves the military has a very high opinion of their peers' professionalism, dedication, and so forth."
[07:17:57] <imode> counterpoint et. anecdata: my cousin was raped and nearly beaten to death in the marines. she'd rather see the country burn than do that again.
[07:18:46] <imode> also I love the "google swooped in and took over, built roads, infra, etc. therefore they are good" yeah, in the same way an invading force in your country is good, they'll build things that accomplish their mission.
[07:19:23] <imode> just because you do "good things" doesn't mean you have ulterior motives, or that those things are good when those motives are made clear/taken away.

[14:16:14] <Brekkjern> kline: Why? Many of the complaints are reasonable, at least as feedback for the UX design.
[14:16:49] <epilys> It's a rehash of the constant complaining, with no action taken to ameliorate the situatio
[14:16:50] <epilys> n
[14:17:20] <Brekkjern> That's because it's immediately getting dismissed like usual
[14:17:42] <Brekkjern> I mean... Nothing will improve if nobody is even willing to do any critical introspection
[14:18:53] <epilys> foss is usually a do-ocracy. If you want something, do it
[14:19:35] <Brekkjern> Considering the absurd amount of shitstorms on mailing lists, I disagree.
[14:20:03] <epilys> shitstorms under PATCH sets or just flamewars?
[14:20:30] <Brekkjern> Sure, something getting done hinges on someone doing it, but it's not like discussions about what would be good ways forward or how one wants a system to work is invalid
[14:21:18] <Brekkjern> I don't think the shitstorms are isolated to any sort of specific type of discussions
[14:21:41] <edk> i don't think anyone is unwilling to do introspection
[14:21:55] <Brekkjern> Yeah they are. Just look at the thread.
[14:22:24] <edk> the number of people who complain about problems with linux and say "foss needs to" or "linux needs to" or so is just much larger than the number of people who are prepared to do anything
[14:22:27] <Brekkjern> The highest rated subthread in that post is someone burying their head in the sand
[14:22:55] <Brekkjern> edk: What is user feedback but people voicing their opinion and not being prepared to do anything?
[14:23:09] <edk> it is, and sometimes it's useful, but not in this case
[14:23:15] <Brekkjern> Why?
[14:23:26] <edk> everyone already knows
[14:23:30] <Brekkjern> I don't.
[14:23:41] <Brekkjern> Enlighten me about why my opinion doesn't matter.
[14:23:41] <edk> are you going to be doing anything about it?
[14:23:56] <edk> i mean, if you're not going to do anything about it, it... doesn't
[14:23:59] <edk> (mine doesn't either)
[14:24:16] <epilys> this is like being a Umarell https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umarell
[14:24:16] <buttsbot> Umarell - Wikipedia
[14:24:22] <epilys> you voice your opinion on the people who do the work
[14:24:46] <edk> it's not important for everyone who is working on foss to know that you personally find it to be imperfect for the following list of 100 reasons
[14:24:51] <epilys> btw I'm not saying this seriously, no hard feelings :p
[14:24:54] <Brekkjern> I'm not voicing my opinion on the people doing the work. I'm voicing my opinion on the UX design.
[14:25:25] <edk> well, great. but why should anyone else care about that opinion?
[14:25:27] <Brekkjern> I'm voicing my opinion about statements like this: "For the Steam installation issue, on windows you basically have two options: you install it and it works or it doesn’t."
[14:26:06] <Brekkjern> edk: I'd imagine the people who spend time developing these systems want users.
[14:26:14] <Brekkjern> If they don't, then why bother?
[14:26:31] <edk> i am quite confident they already know people find their UX to be subpar
[14:26:36] <Brekkjern> For all the faults of MS and Apple, they at least pretend to give a shit about their users.
[14:26:51] <edk> i know for a fact that the developers of several OSes have been watching those videos too
[14:27:05] <Brekkjern> Yes. Because the feedback matters.
[14:27:06] <epilys> In MY opinion the designers/developers care about their ego at least as much as the users
[14:27:57] <edk> i think it's just extremely entitled to think they should care about your opinion specifically
[14:28:15] <Brekkjern> edk: You are misrepresenting the argument.
[14:28:17] <edk> it's not a useful or important opinion. lots of other people also have it, and they already know about those people
[14:28:47] <Brekkjern> I'm not saying they should give a shit about my opinion. I'm arguing that people shouldn't spend time making arguments about why it the opinion is irrelevant
[14:28:52] <Brekkjern> Exactly like you are doing now
[14:29:04] <edk> you're spending time making arguments about why the opinion is not irrelevant
[14:29:39] <edk> neither of us is improving the situation for anyone but ourselves here
[14:29:55] <Brekkjern> I don't think we are improving our own situations either
[14:30:30] <edk> i mean, we apparently both like arguing on IRC about our irrelevant opinions about something we're not prepared to actually devote energy to fixing
[14:30:37] <edk> i'm just not pretending it's somehow a public service
[14:31:02] <Brekkjern> What do you mean "public service"?
[14:32:12] <Brekkjern> Gotta run. Meeting.
[14:39:19] <edk> i guess that's how most complaints about foss UX seem to be framed
[14:39:27] <edk> "if foss wants users, it needs to ..."
[14:40:16] <edk> maybe that's just a way people express their frustration. i dunno. but i get the feeling that people do think they're doing something useful by pointing out all the ways in which foss doesn't live up to their expectations
[14:41:15] <edk> the problem is that if foss wants to ..., it needs resources
[14:41:57] <edk> steam doesn't (usually. i've had some bad experiences...) break on windows because valve and microsoft both pay teams of testers to make sure that doesn't happen
[14:43:26] <edk> repeatedly telling foss developers about all the problems they have is not helping fix them
[14:43:26] <buttsbot> 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏
[15:15:56] <kline> Brekkjern, its just a list of gripes a tech-adjacent (because hes not very technical, really) entertainer (because he does play up the role) has about linux, half of which arent actionable and none of which will actually be actioned by this submission
[15:15:56] <buttsbot> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux.
[15:17:03] <kline> im sorry that the tools nvidia provides dont have good ux. im sorry that linus doesnt like the way that kde plasma looks, im sorry that the mouse acceleration default is not to his preference out the box, im sorry "something about ark"
[15:17:13] <kline> but really, why is this a good submission for lobsters?
[15:18:13] <kline> half of the issues dont even sit with foss developers, the others are split between ui preferences and just a lack of practice
[15:18:13] <buttsbot> 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏
[15:19:05] <kline> for example: "Using apt or apt-get on Manjaro doesn’t warn you that you’re using the wrong package manager."
[15:19:28] <kline> if i opened up powershell on windows and couldnt install packages with apt out of the box, is this a problem with windows?
[15:41:01] <gerikson> who is this Linus
[15:41:09] <gerikson> I mean he's not *the* Linus
[15:51:10] <prussian> kline: I lol'd at the first checkbox. "Best Linux distro for gaming."

[16:06:50] <Brekkjern> Heh
[16:07:00] <Brekkjern> He's proooobably more of a milennial :P
[16:07:08] <gerikson> kline: it's a shit submission because it's just a reskin of the GH issue AFAICS
[16:07:40] <kline> even if it werent
[16:07:45] <kline> its still shit on its own
[16:07:56] <kline> gerikson | who is this Linus
[16:08:20] <kline> buys high end consumer hardware and reviews, but he has no credibility to anyone technical
[16:08:54] <Brekkjern> No. He's just a representation of a somewhat techincal user who has quite a few issues getting shit to work on Linux
[16:08:57] <kline> highlights include misconfiguring his raid array such that as soon as any drive fails the entire array is hosed, with no backups, then having to call the geeksquad to fix it
[16:09:53] <kline> Brekkjern, no, hes far more a media person who found an underexploited tech niche than someone in tech who realised the media side was underserved
[16:12:20] <kline> i expect he cruises on the cranwell horizon, ie, as long as he spends an hour reading up on something before he does a review, he's going to have enough of the buzzwords and tricks to give a veneer of expertise
[16:12:52] <kline> but anyone who knows that area can see its a veneer, whereas just by the numbers game most of his audience wont, and he looks authoritative
[16:17:20] <Brekkjern> Just dismissing these issues because of the source does nobody any good. I would likely encounter many of these same issues if I were to do something similar.
[16:17:35] <kline> i didnt dismiss them because of the source
[16:17:47] <Brekkjern> Sure I know the difference between pacman and apt, but there are plenty of other issues he raises that are universal or bad UX
[16:17:50] <kline> a bit up i listed a bunch of issues and pointed out what i thought was wrong with them
[16:17:59] <kline> i was addressing the "who is linus" question

[17:18:40] <gwozniak> I have no background knowledge on this, really, and it's a shit submission.  I have no idea what the point is aside from an instigation of useless bickering
[17:19:16] <Brekkjern> It's only instigating bickering because Linux users take it so personally really...
[17:19:46] <gwozniak> I've started to watch one or two Linus Tech Tips and turned them off after about a minute when I realized there would be no useful content.  That's the extent of my knowledge about him
[17:20:33] <Brekkjern> I find some of the stuff fun or interesting, but I don't watch it for the deep technical content to put it like that
[17:20:34] <gwozniak> It's just an entirely useless discussion
[17:20:51] <Brekkjern> It could have been productive though
[17:21:03] <gwozniak> In some magical world, maybe
[17:21:06] <edk> could it?
[17:21:15] <Brekkjern> Yes
[17:22:35] <Brekkjern> The people who made that site have suggestions for ways to avoid the footguns. The people at Pop_OS are making changes to the UX when you interact with apt and are going to make system-destroying changes to avoid the issue Linus had.
[17:23:06] <Brekkjern> Fuck, just disabling mouse acceleration by default in KDE would already make the mouse settings better than Windows by default
[17:23:45] <edk> windows also enables mouse acceleration by default
[17:23:48] <Brekkjern> Yes.
[17:23:51] <Brekkjern> It sucks
[17:24:10] <edk> i mean, i don't like it. i would imagine some people do like it
[17:24:27] <edk> one of the bigger practical problems with complaint-driven development is that you don't get that signal
[17:24:32] <Brekkjern> I bet most people wouldn't notice if it is on or off to be honest
[17:24:44] <edk> all you can do is change a thing when people complain, and then wait to see if more people complain about it going away

[17:33:31] <buttsbot> What desktop Linux needs to succeed in the mainstream
[17:39:48] <Brekkjern> I agree in general with that post
[17:40:01] <Brekkjern> And yeah, the source of it is kinda weird
[17:40:04] <Brekkjern> But he's mostly right
[17:40:36] <epilys> hello hoistbypetard
[17:41:07] <hoistbypetard> hi epilys
[17:42:04] <hoistbypetard> Brekkjern: I generally agree with it too.
[17:45:13] <edk> the problem is that people aren't going to do this; it takes a ton of time and money and a lot of that time needs to be spent by people who aren't programmers, which is hard to arrange when the current state needs you to be a programmer to use the OS easily
[17:46:02] <edk> linux is good for servers now because the biggest tech companies in the world are all investing tens of millions in bringing that about
[17:46:26] <edk> linux would be good for desktops if the biggest tech companies in the world would all invest tens of millions in bringing that about, but they have no incentive to do that
[17:46:49] <Brekkjern> I mean, someone just volunteered to collect and sort through user feedback by creating that GH repo, coming up with possible viable solutions and seeing if there are existing issues on the problems they faced. They face ridicule from the community instead.
[17:47:49] <edk> i think i said this before, but it's a mistake to think that telling people about the problems they have is any kind of contribution to solving those problems
[17:48:05] <edk> it can be, in the best case
[17:48:34] <edk> but given all the major distros are already working on solutions, i'm not sure that it is here
[17:48:39] <Brekkjern> The people who made that GH repo aren't telling other people about those issues. They are verifying them, looking into solutions, and seeing if there are simple changes one could make to the defaults that distros ship with.
[17:49:26] <edk> that may well be a valuable service if they're coordinating with the right people
[17:49:38] <edk> i remain unconvinced that the page is
[17:51:23] <Brekkjern> The page has links to the issues raised in the projects issue trackers
[17:51:35] <Brekkjern> You can follow them there and make comments on the discussions there
[17:52:42] <edk> for me it has links to some youtube videos

[17:54:04] <edk> ok, it has links to a handful of them. i continue to not see how this is helping anyone
[17:57:45] <kline> Brekkjern | Yes [windows does what linux does]
[17:57:54] <kline> half the issues are "i want linux to be more like windows"
[17:58:10] <kline> if you did this another bunch of people would be up in arms about mouse accel _not_ being on
[17:58:14] <edk> it doesn't even matter
[17:58:45] <kline> edk, my point is that half of these are just some guys subjective preferences
[17:59:04] <edk> for all i think linus is an idiot, i actually would say that what he did is useful work, in that he's made distros notice that not-very-technical users will encounter some of these problems
[17:59:11] <edk> but those distros... have already noticed
[17:59:17] <edk> a lot of these things are already being worked on
[17:59:32] <Brekkjern> Then mark those that are his subjective preferences as "Won'tfix" and move the fuck on to the others then?
[17:59:46] <edk> i don't understand how making a list of them and bikeshedding it on github is improving the situation
[18:00:47] <kline> Brekkjern, im ok with that but once you remove those that are subjective-wontfix and not-us-cantfix then you dont have enough for it to be a worthwhile article

[22:09:36] <Brekkjern> The old UI is so much better than the new one. Especially with RES
[22:09:48] <dimadima> whether it's better or worse, you can't maintain two UIs
[22:09:51] <manicennui> Brekkjern: There are advantages to the new UI
[22:09:53] <dimadima> and expect to function
[22:10:00] <manicennui> It is focused more on showing the content inline.
[22:10:06] <manicennui> Which is really the only reason to use reddit
[22:10:15] <Brekkjern> manicennui: That is why I use RES.
[22:10:23] <Brekkjern> You get the old UI with inline content.
[22:10:29] <dimadima> talking phlebotomy i need to get my booster :(
[22:10:36] <manicennui> But their photo and gif/video viewers are fucking terrible.
[22:10:50] <dimadima> they need the cloud
[22:11:00] <manicennui> Love when someone uploads multiple photos and they are all cut off so you have to click each one to see it fully.
[22:11:19] <manicennui> And their video player likes to restart like 15 times while the page loads.
[22:11:23] <manicennui> And it stalls out all the time.
[22:11:40] <Brekkjern> Works fine for me
[22:11:44] <Brekkjern> At least on old
[22:11:50] <manicennui> How can't they attract anyone competent?
[22:11:59] <dimadima> they need to do a third UI
[22:12:05] <dimadima> and drop the first two
[22:12:09] <dimadima> and fire everybody

[22:18:29] <Brekkjern> I haven't thought about them ever. Is that a good or bad thing?

[22:35:17] <manicennui> Yup.
[22:35:21] <manicennui> That was one of the hits.
[22:35:25] <dimadima> does he mean intercourse or sex/gender

[22:58:27] <manicennui> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9S5-EB8dR8
[22:58:27] <edk> young me didn't appreciate that a fiction book could have pretty much nothing happen and still be good
[22:58:27] <buttsbot> Henry Rollins hates dating - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9S5-EB8dR8
[22:58:54] <jjuran> So, whodunnit?  Was it Colloquy?  Was it the browser?  Will we /ever/ found out the truth?
[22:58:54] <dimadima> edk: (i was kinda joking, kinda serious)
[22:58:59] <dimadima> edk: ah yeah
[22:59:37] <jjuran> Or is the OS itself responsible?
[22:59:58] <indigo> HPMOR is cringe fanfic
[23:01:17] <edk> i assumed that was a joke
[23:01:28] <indigo> jjuran: Hopefully the syslog will tell you
[23:07:50] <manicennui> "How to win friends and influence people"
[23:07:53] <manicennui> Another red flag.
[23:09:02] <jjuran> The last message written to system.log prior to reboot was five minutes earier
[23:09:06] <jjuran> *earlier
[23:09:48] <jjuran> There's so much noise in here.
[23:10:05] <manicennui> I'm sorry we aren't up to your standards.
[23:11:37] <jjuran> No, the log file
[23:11:41] <jjuran> com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.imfoundation.IMRemoteURLConnectionAgent): Unknown key for integer: _DirtyJetsamMemoryLimit
[23:12:05] <jjuran> That's the syslog swan song
[23:14:00] <jjuran> But another one just happened now, so it's bogus
[23:16:05] * manicennui wonders whether Pittsburgh is similar to St. Louis.
[23:16:15] <manicennui> St. Louis feels like a much smaller, sadder Chicago.
[23:19:59] <manicennui> The hills look nicer.
[23:20:08] <manicennui> In Pittsburgh.
[23:32:28] <jjuran> In particular, the funicular
[23:33:34] <dimadima> yeah funiculars
[23:33:42] <dimadima> the funiculars
[23:48:00] <kline> Church, i dont know where you work but that _feels_ both unlikely but tragicly doabel
[23:49:03] <Church> kline: Yeah I was incorrect thankfully
[23:49:41] <Church> Just odd, because over the years I've found out where stone, lives, his name, his hobbies, etc and even have pictures of him from his rambles in chat.
[23:50:04] <Church> They all matched up with our new hire today heh, slightly off but close enough to ping my oh shit meter.
