[23:17:34] <oats> I'm yet to find a US bank that uses standard topt/hotp 2fa
[23:17:51] <oats> they always use their own dumbass app or some auth company I've never heard of
[23:17:58] <Church> cb: Don't tempt me. That sounds fun and constrained.
[23:19:32] <defect> my bank still has those dumb "What is your mothers maiden name"-type questions :|

[23:21:33] <manicennui> lkhrs: Those I have standard answers for that I remember.
[23:21:51] <manicennui> But there are a couple of sites that only give me questions that I don't really have a good answer for.

[23:23:16] <manicennui> Could be worse. I tried to get my free credit reports once, and it wanted me to pick my exact car payment amount from like a decade before.
[23:23:29] <manicennui> And a couple of the answers were in the range that seemed plausible.
[23:24:56] <manicennui> I guessed wrong and didn't get access.
[23:26:47] <varjag> the national BankID here uses EAP-SIM or something like that
[23:27:25] <varjag> out of band 2fa
[23:27:29] <defect> i like bankid, wish there was something similar in the us
[23:27:39] <manicennui> We do everything worse.
[23:27:47] <manicennui> Like we fucked up CC chips.
[23:28:08] <manicennui> Americans are too dumb for pins or something.
[23:28:47] <defect> i love going back to sweden and using my american card. the waiter or bartender is always super surprised i have to sign

[23:30:23] <lkhrs> I can't wait for mag stripes to get removed from cards. gas stations have chip readers now but they still involve the whole stripe going into the reader, which could be rigged
[23:31:07] <Church> I just have my bank tied to my fingerprint now
[23:31:09] <Church> Which works
[23:31:13] <lkhrs> it's like, why even have the damn chip reader if I have to stick the card all the way in
[23:31:20] <manicennui> Church: What does that mean?
[23:31:38] <Church> Fingerprint reader for login
[23:31:55] <edk> it's using the card in shops and stuff that's the issue, i imagine

[23:34:03] <lkhrs> maybe I can just scrape the mag stripe off myself, if I encounter a place that doesn't have a chip reader, it may not be worth it anyway. It's been increasingly rare these last few years, for me anyway.
[23:35:27] <jj5> lkhrs: if you don't want to actually scratch it off you could take a strong magnet to it...
[23:35:34] <lkhrs> oh really
[23:35:42] <jj5> lol
[23:37:27] <varjag> why can't i just do 2fa with my pfizer 5g chip
[23:38:15] <lkhrs> because Windows Hello is not secure apparently
