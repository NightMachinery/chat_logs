[03:40:48] <sumthing1980> hello Im trying to run a php class I get error Uncaught Error: Class 'RobotsTxtParser' not found in /home/x/Desktop/01/04.php:30
[03:40:58] <sumthing1980> Do I include the php files as normal?
[03:41:12] <sumthing1980> do they have to be same name as the class and things like that
[03:41:42] *** Quits: Poboy (~Poboy@user/poboy) (Quit: Client closed)
[03:41:52] <da_wunder> share that file with us, use eg. gist.github.com
[03:42:07] <da_wunder> s/that file/those files
[03:42:11] <sumthing1980> its these two files https://github.com/bopoda/robots-txt-parser/tree/master/src/RobotsTxtParser
[03:42:50] <da_wunder> that 04.php is missing where you see that problem
[03:43:20] <sumthing1980> it is just this from my code
[03:43:21] <sumthing1980> $parser=new RobotsTxtParser($c);
[03:43:29] <sumthing1980> I get the error with that
[03:43:41] <sumthing1980> I tried include "RobotsTxtParser.php" and the other one
[03:43:43] <Cheez> sumthing1980: have you added the library using composer, and have you added the composer autoloader to your code
[03:43:52] <sumthing1980> no
[03:44:08] <da_wunder> so that file doesn't load your vendor/autoload.php file or something else - that is why I asked you to share that file too
[03:44:09] <sumthing1980> I made new php files
[03:44:09] <Cheez> if not you'll have to include the files yourself before using the classes.
[03:44:23] <sumthing1980> yes ok
[03:44:32] <sumthing1980> so include "RobotsTxtParser.php"; still get that error
[03:44:48] <sumthing1980>  Class 'RobotsTxtParser' not found in ...
[03:44:50] <Cheez> you need the namespace
[03:45:10] <da_wunder> please just share that 04.php file contents...
[03:45:10] <Cheez> RobotsTxtParser\RobotsTxtParser
[03:45:11] <sumthing1980> meaning?
[03:45:31] <sumthing1980> about needing namespace ?
[03:45:33] <Cheez> or import it with a using
[03:45:39] <Cheez> use*
[03:45:54] <Cheez> https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php
[03:45:57] <sumthing1980> I have these that are relevant to this
[03:45:59] <sumthing1980> include "RobotsTxtParser.php";
[03:45:59] <sumthing1980> include "RobotsTxtValidator.php";
[03:45:59] <sumthing1980> $parser=new RobotsTxtParser($c);
[03:46:07] <sumthing1980> I get error at new
[03:46:36] <da_wunder> sumthing1980: just require `vendor/autoload.php` file that should cover you
[03:46:42] <sumthing1980> two php files I created them with same names and added the contents
[03:46:48] <Cheez> da_wunder: they already said they arent using composer
[03:46:51] <sumthing1980> and if I do include and do new shouldnt that work?
[03:47:15] <Cheez> sumthing1980: you need the fully qualified class name
[03:47:18] <Cheez> which includes the namespace
[03:47:25] <da_wunder> Cheez: https://github.com/bopoda/robots-txt-parser/blob/master/composer.json that is telling that composer is used...
[03:47:42] <Cheez> da_wunder: sumthing1980 has downloaded that library and is using it directly by the osunds of it
[03:47:49] <Cheez> rather than adding it via composer
[03:47:57] <da_wunder> huoh...
[03:48:01] <Cheez> not sure why anyone would do that
[03:48:03] <Cheez> but there you go
[03:48:46] <da_wunder> why the hell someone would not composer for that... makes no sense at all
[03:49:06] <Cheez> sumthing1980: you should probably look at using composer, it will make lots of this easier
[03:49:09] <sumthing1980> Because I dont even know what that is
[03:49:30] <Cheez> https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md
[03:49:31] <da_wunder> sumthing1980: see - https://github.com/bopoda/robots-txt-parser#installation
[03:50:11] <sumthing1980> I need to be able to send the code to other computers and make it work there
[03:50:15] <da_wunder> sumthing1980: why don't you follow installing instructions?
[03:50:40] <Cheez> sumthing1980: you can send the built artifact including a vendor folder and have that work if needed
[03:51:15] <da_wunder> sumthing1980: that is totally different topic - but there are tools for that too, eg. deployer https://deployer.org/
[03:53:03] <sumthing1980> Installing bopoda/robots-txt-parser (v2.4.1): Downloading (100%)
[03:53:03] <sumthing1980> Writing lock file
[03:53:03] <sumthing1980> Generating autoload files
[03:53:13] <sumthing1980> what now
[03:53:31] <sumthing1980> did it install in var or?
[03:54:04] <da_wunder> just require that `vendor/autoload.php` file in your script and use those those classes
[03:54:20] <da_wunder> and really don't paste multiline stuff to irc
[03:59:32] <sumthing1980> thanks people Ill look at it some other time
[04:00:41] <sumthing1980> in the file it begins with <?php then namespace RobotsTxtParser then there is a class RobotsTxtParser
[04:01:03] <sumthing1980> shouldnt I be able to include then do new and run it
[04:01:58] <Byteflux> dont be so difficult. use the package the way it was meant to be used, with composer
[04:02:56] <Byteflux> these tools exist for a good reason, it's so people don't have to deal with the issues you're dealing with
[04:02:57] <sumthing1980> Im not doing it to be difficult I dont know those things
[04:03:09] <Byteflux> then learn it
[04:03:13] <s17> there is a file called vendor/autoload, it does all of the including bits for you
[04:03:26] <sumthing1980> I installed composer and downloaded it
[04:03:39] <s17> now you need to include the autoloader from vendor
[04:03:44] <Byteflux> as you've been told, composer has created a vendor/autoload.php for you
[04:03:47] <s17> and then you can new Whatever()
[04:03:49] <sumthing1980> it installed in .cache/composer/files/bopoda/robots-txt-parser
[04:03:59] <sumthing1980> I dont know what vendor autoload is
[04:04:23] <__adrian> it's the autolaoder that composer generates
[04:04:23] <Blondie101010> include that path
[04:04:29] <sumthing1980> Im trying to interpolate from what you are saying
[04:04:39] <Blondie101010> don't..  it's very clear
[04:04:40] <s17> how did you install to .cache?
[04:04:52] <Blondie101010> require "vendor/autoload.php";
[04:05:07] <sumthing1980> I wrote composer require bopoda/robots-txt-parser
[04:05:11] <sumthing1980> it installed in .cache
[04:05:59] <sumthing1980> the two php files with the classes are in a zip file in that dir
[04:06:18] <__adrian> sumthing1980:  this sounds like you have no idea how to use composer
[04:06:30] <sumthing1980> well no shit
[04:06:45] <sumthing1980> I dont
[04:07:01] <Blondie101010> what do you mean about your php files being in a zip?
[04:07:12] <Blondie101010> isn't this on your web server?
[04:07:19] <__adrian> there are eady directions. usually on whatever library/app you're trying to install. e.g., is the thing you want  bopoda/robots-txt-parser  ?
[04:07:21] <sumthing1980> I did composer require bopoda/robots-txt-parser
[04:07:31] <s17> from your home directory? :x
[04:07:32] <__adrian> that ^ is all you need to do
[04:07:46] <__adrian> IN the directory you want it installed in (i.e., in your project dircetory)
[04:07:52] <sumthing1980> it installed into /home/x/.cache/composer/files/bopoda/robots-txt-parser
[04:07:57] <da_wunder> sumthing1980: one sec I will create a repository for you
[04:08:04] <Byteflux> first things first, did you actually go to https://getcomposer.org/ ?
[04:08:08] <sumthing1980> not web server
[04:08:09] <__adrian> sumthing1980:  how did you manage that
[04:08:12] <Byteflux> did you read "Getting Started" and "Basic Usage" ?
[04:08:16] <Byteflux> if you haven't done those two things
[04:08:17] <Byteflux> STOP
[04:08:18] <Byteflux> and go do it.
[04:08:19] <da_wunder> sumthing1980: there you go - https://github.com/tarlepp/sumthing1980
[04:08:22] <sumthing1980> I did sudo apt install composer
[04:08:26] <Byteflux> then you did it wrong
[04:08:40] <__adrian> yeah, remove it using apt
[04:08:44] <Byteflux> that is not how you install composer properly.
[04:08:46] <__adrian> then install from the website
[04:09:00] <sumthing1980> ok
[04:09:01] <Byteflux> I will say it again for your benefit. Go to getcomposer.org. Read "Getting Started" then after that read "Basic Usage"
[04:09:05] <__adrian> ^
[04:09:15] <Byteflux> Then all of your problems will magically go away and you won't be confused any more
[04:09:23] <s17> :)
[04:09:32] <Blondie101010> sumthing1980:  so it's for a CLI only script?
[04:10:05] <sumthing1980> yes
[04:10:27] <Blondie101010> ok, so does it work with the autoload include?
[04:10:40] <Byteflux> They installed composer from apt
[04:10:46] <Byteflux> Which is either not composer or a very, very old composer.
[04:11:03] <Blondie101010> doesn't usually matter
[04:11:08] <Byteflux> It does.
[04:11:13] <Blondie101010> not usually
[04:11:15] <Byteflux> Unless it came from ondrej's PPA
[04:11:21] <Byteflux> If it didn't, then it very much does.
[04:11:32] <__adrian> it's very likely composer.
[04:11:36] <sumthing1980> ok it installed into vendor
[04:11:41] <sumthing1980> it has autoload.php
[04:11:50] <__adrian> but it's probably old and not installed as desired
[04:12:00] <Byteflux> If you require that, it will magically know how to load your dependencies
[04:13:30] <sumthing1980> require "vendor/autoload.php" ?
[04:13:43] <__adrian> prefer fully qualified paths, but yes
[04:15:26] <da_wunder> sumthing1980: or just something like - https://github.com/tarlepp/sumthing1980/blob/master/index.php#L5
[04:16:07] <sumthing1980> use ???
[04:16:11] <da_wunder> sumthing1980: that repository has working code that you can look
[04:16:15] <sumthing1980> I gotta do that?
[04:16:20] <sumthing1980> "use " ?
[04:16:30] <__adrian> you should
[04:16:37] <Byteflux> Have to? No. Should? Yes.
[04:16:44] <__adrian> aliasing really helps keep things clear
[04:16:55] <Byteflux> Otherwise you would have to do `new \RobotsTxtParser\RobotsTxtParser()`
[04:17:06] <da_wunder> ^
[04:17:22] <sumthing1980> it Works!
[04:17:27] <sumthing1980> use was missing
[04:17:35] <sumthing1980> ffs
[04:17:37] <sumthing1980> thanks a lot
[04:17:39] <sumthing1980> guys
[04:17:48] <da_wunder> your ide should show things like that you clearly
[04:18:02] <sumthing1980> I use geany
[04:18:04] <__adrian> https://php.net/namespace  might be useful for you
[04:18:21] <da_wunder> sumthing1980: for php stuff I really recommend you to use phpstorm
[04:18:55] <sumthing1980> 30 day free trial...
[04:19:08] <da_wunder> so?
[04:19:08] <__adrian> choice of IDE is a personal preference; beyond the basic features that any good ide has, none have any substantial/critical advantage
[04:19:22] <__adrian> try a bunch and see which one you like
[04:19:31] <da_wunder> ^
[04:19:48] <Byteflux> PHPStorm isn't free but if you do this as a job it basically costs nothing. VSCode is free and works fine too. The main benefit of either is that they'll have complex analytical tooling to catch these issues.
[04:19:53] <Byteflux> A plain editor doesn't tell you anything.
[04:20:00] <da_wunder> and that 30 days should give you quite good look
[04:20:31] <sumthing1980>  sudo snap install phpstorm --classic
[04:20:35] <sumthing1980> snap command not found
[04:20:38] <sumthing1980> sudo apt install snap
[04:20:44] <sumthing1980> installed
[04:20:46] <__adrian> "basics" would include syntax highlighting and linting. nice-to-haves are autocompletion, refactorng tools, etc.
[04:20:48] <sumthing1980> still command not found
[04:20:53] <da_wunder> huoh don't use apt to install phpstorm...
[04:21:04] <__adrian> ^
[04:21:06] <Blondie101010> sumthing1980:  refer to your sysadmin or OS support
[04:21:17] <sumthing1980> yea ok
[04:21:18] <Byteflux> snap is right on Ubuntu
[04:21:24] <__adrian> generally true of any ide. download from the ide's website.
[04:21:29] <Byteflux> that's the correct way to install Jetbrains IDEs on Ubuntu
[04:21:31] <sumthing1980> thanks a lot again Ill try phpstorm later
[04:21:37] <da_wunder> sumthing1980: download this - https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/
[04:21:50] <__adrian> true. corrected: follow instructions on the ide's website.
[04:21:52] <da_wunder> sumthing1980: and use it to install those IDEs
[04:22:03] <sumthing1980> ok
[04:22:19] <Byteflux> I don't know why your Ubuntu doesn't have snap
[04:22:24] <Byteflux> Unless it's really, really old or something
[04:22:28] <Byteflux> Or you aren't using Ubuntu
[04:22:35] <sumthing1980> mint latest
[04:22:40] <sumthing1980> almost
[04:23:11] <Byteflux> Being based on Ubuntu doesn't make it Ubuntu, unfortunately.
[04:23:20] <Sammitch> Snap: the universal package manager that only really works for ubuntu!
[04:23:22] <Byteflux> They decided to get rid of Ubuntu Snap for whatever reason.
[04:23:32] <__adrian> ubuntu did extra to make snap work ("work")
[04:23:50] <__adrian> no idea what built-in support's like on mint
[04:23:56] <__adrian> something you'd have to look up.
[04:24:18] <s17> I tried one snap package only and it was missing fonts or icons and the app window was just nonsense
[04:24:27] <sumthing1980> I have installed phpstorm now
[04:24:31] <sumthing1980> thanks Ill check it out
[04:25:00] <sumthing1980> bye all take care

[20:58:40] <AllenJB> Rockwood: Is there a reason you're not using PHP's built-in sessions? Have you looked at how those work?
[21:00:22] <Rockwood> actually client's question is if browser closed then?
[21:00:45] <Rockwood> if loggedin it should be login for full day on that machine
[21:00:49] <Rockwood> or computer
[21:01:38] <AllenJB> You can adjust the lifetime settings on PHP's sessions (both server-side gc settings and cookie lifetime).
[21:01:57] <AllenJB> Which is no different than what you'd need to set up if you do it all yourself

[21:03:32] <Rockwood> yeah session i am already using in it
[21:03:46] <AllenJB> That's the cookie settings. If you set a cookie lifetime of 0 it becomes a "session cookie" that automatically gets deleted on browser close. You can set a lifetime of (for example) 8 hours, then the cookie will live for that time regardless of if the browser is closed
[21:03:46] <Sammitch> that would be the session lifetime settings
[21:03:52] <Naktibalda> Rockwood: !+remember me
[21:03:52] <php-bot> Rockwood, To let users stay logged in for longer than your PHP session lifetime: Pick a random value, save it in the user's record in your database, and give it to the user with setcookie(). Then you can later check $_COOKIE to lookup the matching user record from your db and fill in $_SESSION. For more see https://web.archive.org/web/20140822223950/http://sheriframadan.com/2011/12/remember-me

[22:16:53] <Rockwood> celphi, make sure you point is very clear in use that
[22:17:07] <biberu> Rockwood: for celphi, your examples are fine :)
[22:17:40] <biberu> i just don't understand why celphi isn't / can't use either of those solutions
[22:18:22] <Rockwood> or install PHP 8
[22:18:28] <Rockwood> celphi, ^^
[22:19:00] <Rockwood> in that you can do ?a as optional param
[22:20:10] <Rockwood> i think
[22:20:59] <celphi> like this
[22:21:00] <celphi> https://3v4l.org/ZjUm6#v7.3.29
[22:21:05] <celphi> no i cant do 8
[22:21:48] <biberu>         // sometimes there's params and sometimes not base on controller
[22:21:56] <biberu> celphi: ^ i guess that is the issue?
[22:22:09] <celphi> yes
[22:22:17] <celphi> i want it to work either way
[22:22:20] <biberu> if they don't exist they should either be an empty array, or the calling method should adapt it
[22:22:38] <biberu> is params a property on the base?
[22:22:57] <celphi> it's an array of values that are injected into the template
[22:23:15] <biberu> the issue seems to be before that
[22:23:17] <celphi> but not all templates when need values (params)
[22:23:45] <biberu> those could just call render with an empty array as an argument
[22:23:45] <celphi> *but not all templates will need values
[22:24:11] <biberu> or if params is a property on the base you could initialize it to an empty array
[22:24:18] <biberu> no default needed even
[22:24:36] <celphi> i think im just going to go with your original suggestion of making caller always send at least an empty array
[22:24:54] <celphi> or at least make the caller not use at all i suppose
[22:25:02] <s17> or send nothing and it'll be an empty array anyway
[22:25:26] <__adrian> > // sometimes there's params and sometimes not base on controller
[22:25:30] <__adrian> this is your problem
[22:25:43] <__adrian> you don't know what variables exist and/or haven't validated them properly
[22:26:01] <biberu> choosing how to call it might introduce a new branch in your logic, which is an extra test to write (e.g. if params render(params) else render())
[22:26:20] <biberu> if you just always have an array, empty or not, you avoid that
[22:26:28] <__adrian> where does $params come from? i'd guess it should _always_ be defined, and always be an array, even if empty.
[22:26:41] <biberu> ^ also wondering
[22:26:44] <celphi> ok ill just remove
[22:27:04] <__adrian> note this doesn't mean you need to remove the = [] on your render() method
[22:27:18] <biberu> it doesn't mean you *need* it either
[22:27:23] <__adrian> (doesn't mean you have to keep it either, but certainly doesn't mean you have to remove it)
[22:27:38] <Rockwood> one more thing validation is very important point as __adrian saying
[22:27:41] * biberu is suspicious of defaults
[22:27:48] <__adrian> removing it would be a contract change and might break other code that calls the method
[22:28:17] <celphi> nah it works
[22:28:24] <biberu> it might be, perhaps the interface isn't stable, but that's also why defaults can be tricky
[22:28:25] <celphi> i added a section
[22:29:16] <__adrian> perhaps perhaps
[22:29:17] <celphi> https://3v4l.org/ZjUm6#v7.3.29
[22:29:35] <celphi> that way i can make $params = array of validated values
[22:30:42] <celphi> https://3v4l.org/XbYCL#v7.3.29
[22:30:46] <__adrian> in your example, $params is not defined at all. that's why i was asking where it came from and how it was defined.
[22:31:06] <celphi> yeah i havent built taht part yet
[22:31:12] <__adrian> k
[22:31:23] <celphi> but you see what i did with isGet
[22:31:23] <Rockwood> https://gist.github.com/Cyberiaaxis/2343b450ecd9e151e34f0ce399b9b028 this part is confusing me
[22:31:25] <__adrian> so that's the reason it doesn't work; you didn't write it yet  :D
[22:31:43] <celphi> why is that confusing
[22:31:59] <Rockwood> from where you got this?
[22:32:02] *** Quits: Brion (~Brion@gateway/tor-sasl/brion) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:32:08] <celphi> i put `<?= $my_variable ?>` inside my html and it inserts into it
[22:32:20] <__adrian> Rockwood: that's a fairly common templating pattern
[22:32:28] <Rockwood> oh okay
[22:32:37] <__adrian> well...
[22:32:42] <Rockwood> why are the using this kind of stuff
[22:32:47] <Rockwood> they
[22:32:51] <__adrian> except the include_once() part would probably make it break at some point  :)
[22:33:10] <celphi> why wouud it break
[22:33:22] <__adrian> celphi: when you render a template, the template is a pretty important part, isn't it? you NEED it else it doesn't work?
[22:33:25] <Rockwood> on errors
[22:33:31] *** Joins: Brion (~Brion@gateway/tor-sasl/brion)
[22:33:37] <celphi> it only comes back if route exists
[22:33:47] <__adrian> talking about renderViewOnly()
[22:33:54] <__adrian> what happens if you call the method twice?
[22:33:58] *** Joins: Northwoods (~Northwood@103.223.8.125)
[22:34:18] <celphi> what do you mean call it twice
[22:34:22] <Rockwood> double magic :D
[22:34:24] <celphi> it's once per page
[22:34:31] <Northwoods> !empty($var) is considering zero as empty
[22:34:34] <__adrian> i mean, call it twice
[22:34:37] <Northwoods> anyway to fix this
[22:34:40] <__adrian> what do you get the second time?
[22:34:45] <Northwoods> $var is coming from varchar
[22:34:52] <celphi> __adrian: but why would it call it twice on same page?
[22:34:54] <Rockwood> its string
[22:34:55] <Northwoods> "0"
[22:35:03] <celphi> it's just one call per page
[22:35:19] <__adrian> celphi: are you arguing that it's broken on purpose because you don't expect it to be used that way?
[22:35:19] <Rockwood> you should chk ""
[22:35:25] <Rockwood> Northwoods,
[22:35:42] <Rockwood> 0 why?
[22:35:52] <celphi> __adrian: im askig how could you possibly call it twice from a user at a browser
[22:35:55] <Northwoods> if (empty($var) && $var !== '0') { echo $var . ' is empty';}
[22:36:01] <Rockwood> make it int if its not coming like int
[22:36:10] <__adrian> i never said anything about users and browsers
[22:36:23] <__adrian> they don't call code, after all
[22:36:37] <__adrian> what would happen if you called that method twice? what woudl the second call return?
[22:36:43] <Rockwood> Northwoods, why are you saving like 0 a string
[22:36:49] <Rockwood> as a
[22:36:51] <celphi> i would imagine cached data
[22:36:52] *** Quits: Brion (~Brion@gateway/tor-sasl/brion) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:37:00] <Northwoods> Rockwood, thats long story
[22:37:00] <__adrian> maybe you should try it
[22:37:01] <Northwoods> scraping data
[22:37:10] <Rockwood> Northwoods, and wrong story
[22:37:12] <__adrian> what does  include_once  do that  include  soean't do?
[22:37:18] <__adrian> *doesn't
[22:37:28] <celphi> lol include the file once?
[22:37:37] <__adrian> you're mnissing a word
[22:37:41] *** Joins: Brion (~Brion@gateway/tor-sasl/brion)
[22:37:48] <__adrian> includes a file ** only ** once
[22:37:52] <Rockwood> you should make sure about data type for validation Northwoods
[22:38:03] <__adrian> i.e., the second time you called it, it would do nothing. and you'd get an empty string.
[22:38:23] <celphi> oh.
[22:38:24] <Northwoods> Rockwood,
[22:38:25] <__adrian> also, do you know what's different about  require  vs.  include ?
[22:38:33] <Northwoods> so whats escape now
[22:38:35] <celphi> yes the former gives fatal error
[22:38:43] <celphi> if not available
[22:38:50] <Rockwood> Northwoods, in this case you can do make it int first
[22:39:01] <__adrian> right.  include is, effectively, "it's ok to keep going if this fails."
[22:39:14] <Northwoods> ok
[22:39:20] <__adrian> but in a case like this, it's not really ok - without that include, your method can't do its job.
[22:39:31] <__adrian> recommend using   require
[22:39:33] <celphi> so you're saying using require is better?
[22:39:35] <celphi> ok
[22:39:38] <celphi> ty
[22:39:49] <__adrian> (in fact, in _most_ cases,  require  is the one you want)
[22:40:10] <celphi> ok so wouldnt my application just crash then
[22:40:27] <celphi> so im guessing i need to add try/catch to it now?
[22:40:43] <__adrian> your application ought to know how to handle problems like this and return a nice clean HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
[22:40:51] <__adrian> no
[22:41:15] <__adrian> you ONLY try..catch when you know how to fix a problem
[22:41:26] <__adrian> in this case, you don't know how to fix it. let it go uncaught.
[22:41:52] <__adrian> the user gets a 500, you get a message in your error log, and go find out why it's broke.
[22:42:18] <celphi> k
[22:42:36] <Rockwood> Northwoods, https://3v4l.org/rpoN4#v7.3.29
[22:42:43] <Rockwood> hope its help you
[22:42:44] <biberu> you may want to give a somewhat polished error page though, don't leak internal details from stack traces and such
[22:44:18] <__adrian> re: why might that method be called twice: unit testing is the most obvious thing that comes to mind. but the underlying issue is the method shouldn't decide whether it's "supposed" to be called, and shouldn't only work under specific conditions.
[22:44:21] <Rockwood> celphi, one more thing i wanna suggest you about error reporting
[22:44:25] <__adrian> code should work on purpose, not by accident.
[22:44:57] <Rockwood> just log the error ar time of production and display error at time dev
[22:45:21] <celphi> aight good stuff
[22:45:41] <Rockwood> anyway good night
[22:45:49] <Rockwood> my sleeping time
[22:45:54] <celphi> o/
[22:46:34] <Rockwood> __adrian, thanks to make me confident
[22:46:58] <Rockwood> celphi, cheers bro
[22:47:21] <Rockwood> celphi, now i am feeling better now in react and JS too
[22:47:25] <celphi> :D
[22:47:34] <celphi> im learning C++ around work haha
[22:47:59] <Rockwood> C++ make you sound in programming
[22:48:00] <celphi> but adrian def improves my php 10000%
[22:48:02] <Rockwood> makes
[22:48:43] <Rockwood> celphi, he is very expert in understand and explain as per requires
[22:48:53] <celphi> yup.
[22:50:06] <Rockwood> you know __adrian and Blondie101010 given me big help in PHP improve and even in programming concepts
[22:52:05] <Rockwood> celphi, few years back my English was very bad (still not good enough) and __adrian understand it and always helped in that mine time
[22:52:21] <Rockwood> today i can do code
[22:52:28] <celphi> nice!
[22:52:44] <Rockwood> anyway good night
[22:53:07] <Rockwood> __adrian, thanks
