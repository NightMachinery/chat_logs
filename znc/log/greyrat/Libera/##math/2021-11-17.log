[01:26:43] <mycroftiv> i have looked at a fair amount of your visualizations and scanned a bit of the code previously, it is intriguing stuff, but probably not a lot clearer to me than cubical type theory is to you
[01:27:41] <Decker> agreed :)
[01:28:06] <Decker> it's all axis-angle computation...
[01:28:21] <buster> Decker, people know about rotation space, especially physicists ... they don't tend to use it very much
[01:28:25] <mycroftiv> cool quaternion stuff
[01:28:46] <Decker> the closest thing is lie algebra - but the first terms... e^A a is a matrix for that, and it loses what the original axis-angle is..
[01:29:18] <Decker> buster I haven't even found it there... though it's more directly accessable there

[07:04:41] <droid3> Obviously we know how to determine if a graph is planer in a reasonable amount of time. And Planer graphs obviously have crossing number 0
[07:05:16] <droid3> But anybody know of a good algorithmic way to compute crossing numbers from an adjacency matrix for example ???
[07:06:53] <droid3> Also was thinking on the generalization of this to Sn where S0 is sphere , S1 is sphere with one handle , S2 is sphere with two handle ...etc
[07:07:23] <droid3> Is there any algorithmic way to determine the crossing number of a graph embedded in Sn ????

[07:09:15] <droid3> I can prove it for some case but there no general way i can think of yet to do it for Sn in general.
[07:09:59] <droid3> We know that every graph G eventually has a Sn such that the crossing number on it is 0.
[07:10:36] <bollu> droid3 wiki claims computing crossing number is NP hard.
[07:10:58] <droid3> Thats obvious because adding more handle bodies eventually gets rid of all crossings and since the crossings are finite you eventually get 0 on some Sn for G
[07:12:22] <droid3> bollu ya but it doesnt imply on Sn other the S0 that its NP hard ? Or has that also been shown ??

[07:14:41] <droid3> Or did you mean in general on any Sn

[07:59:23] <PlanckWalk> It lets you turn the problem into one where it's planar except for crossings at n points.
[08:00:24] <PlanckWalk> I.e. each handle becomes a point, and each edge passing over or under the handle is now represented as passing through that point.
[08:01:16] <PlanckWalk> There are restrictions on which patterns of edges are allowed, but they're now *combinatorial* restrictions instead of some continuous thing.
[08:02:08] <PlanckWalk> So you could, for example, iterate through all valid patterns.

[08:14:52] <PlanckWalk> A crossing point can also be represented by a new vertex.
[08:16:22] <PlanckWalk> One satisfying certain properties, such as having degree 4 and where its edges are related to two of those in the original graph.
[08:17:11] <PlanckWalk> If you can add one new vertex to a nonplanar graph satisfying those properties, and end up with a planar graph, then your original graph was 1-crossing.
[08:17:31] <droid3> ya but how from the adjacency matrix can one can run thru all the possible infinite drawing configurations of the graph to go thru every possible case to find the min crossing number for it ????
[08:17:45] <PlanckWalk> Drawing?  Drawing has nothing to do with it
[08:18:24] <PlanckWalk> I only mentioned two things: choices for the new vertex and its edges (finitely many), and a test for planarity (also finite)
[08:19:11] <droid3> ya there is properties like that but there just specific case you cannt apply that always to only graph your given to compute the crossing number of it. At best alot of case you can only get upper or lower bounds formulas
[08:19:18] <PlanckWalk> There might be a *lot* of choices, but not infinitely many.
[08:20:08] <PlanckWalk> If none of the choices give you a planar graph, then try 2 new points.
[08:20:19] <PlanckWalk> (There are more efficient known algorithms)

[08:23:10] <PlanckWalk> Think about an actual drawing of a graph with the minimum number of crossings.
[08:23:11] <droid3> how do you know your adjacency matrix for the graph has a crossing to begin with. I could use the planer/nonplaner algorithm test i guess but that doesnt give me away to know how many crossing i have for the graph
[08:23:44] <PlanckWalk> Yes, I'm deliberately using *only* the planarity test here.  There are more efficient algorithms.
[08:24:21] <PlanckWalk> In that drawing, you can replace each crossing with a new vertex and replace the crossing edges with four new edges to this vertex.
[08:24:36] <PlanckWalk> The resulting graph is planar.
[08:24:46] <droid3> ok so say i have a graph G i find that it is nonplaner. What do i do to its adjacency matrix to take out the crossing or add a point
[08:25:20] <PlanckWalk> Replace pairs of edges with edges to a new vertex
[08:25:40] <PlanckWalk> *All possible* pairs of new edges.
[08:25:56] <PlanckWalk> Err, *all possible* pairs of edges
[08:26:31] <PlanckWalk> If any of them give you a planar graph, then your original graph was 1-crossing.
[08:26:43] <droid3> Ok so your basically adding points and testing when it becomes planer from being nonplaner. So it will eventually terminate and be planner
[08:27:34] <droid3> At that point the number of add points to get you to planer first is the crossing number
[08:27:39] <PlanckWalk> Yes

[11:46:43] <int-e> wow. I meant to add "can you express" in front
[11:46:55] <laurus> Oh
[11:47:00] <int-e> then got distracted by the other question
[11:47:01] <laurus> Yes I can
[11:47:09] <laurus> But again, it's very basis-dependent.
[11:47:46] <laurus> If we choose a basis x_1, ..., x_n, then x = (c_1, ..., c_n) for that basis, and \ell(x_i) = a_i
[11:47:56] <laurus> But choosing a different basis gives us different stuff.
[11:49:38] <laurus> int-e: So this is a flaw. If we say an element in X gives a unique \ell, it seems like that is a totally basis dependent argument
[11:49:59] <laurus> (now, I know that _for any given basis_ a unique x gives a unique l)
[11:50:16] <int-e> Does it really though or is the same linear map still associated with the same vector a?
[11:50:20] <laurus> But that doesn't say "for any x we have a unique l" somehow
[11:50:31] <greenbagels> isnt the whole idea that your choice of basis implies a choice of dual basis
[11:50:34] <laurus> int-e: Well, hmm
[11:51:21] <laurus> greenbagels: So, this author, who's a big-shot, doesn't even _mention_ the concept of dual basis anywhere in the book. After struggling for a long time, I think someone here introduced me to that concept which helped a lot
[11:51:34] <laurus> I'm just getting back into this now after a few month hiatus and am approaching things afresh
[11:51:50] <greenbagels> so what do they call it; the space of linear functionals?
[11:51:51] <int-e> (I mentioned inner products because inner products don't need a basis, even though the scalar product (which is the prototypical inner product) is basis dependent)
[11:51:56] *** Joins: texasmusicinstru (~Rheanna@218.78.109.69)
[11:52:01] <laurus> I'm completely open to the concept, based on past experience with this person/book, that that concept needs to be introduced _at some point_ and perhaps this is the necessary point it should come into play.
[11:52:26] <laurus> int-e: Oh, I didn't realize you were actually talking to me at that point, sorry

[11:53:41] <laurus> int-e: So, for a given a = (a_1, ..., a_n) we have a linear map \ell. But that doesn't say that \ell is associated with a unique x in X.
[11:54:00] <laurus> Because x = (a_1, ..., a_n) only equals that for a particular basis.
[11:54:34] <laurus> And yes, I've tried to look at this by talking about x as the (c_1, ..., c_n) instead but I ran into a similar problem

[11:58:04] <laurus> int-e: So the point is, _for a given basis_, the vector a defines l and the function l defines a. Changing that basis still gives us that the vector l defines a unique and vice versa.
[11:58:25] <laurus> So that shows, that regardless of the basis, a gives a unique l and l gives a unique a
[11:58:36] <laurus> But does that really show in the end that X is isomorphic to X' ?
[11:58:52] <laurus> I mean, I see that it's basis independent in the way you just described
[11:59:52] <int-e> Sorry, ignore that. It does change... and the reason is that the inner product is typically no longer a scalar product in that new base.

[12:01:11] <laurus> I am tempted to conclude that this is impossible to show directly
[12:01:40] <laurus> What I did show earlier is that X is isomorphic to K^n, and X' is isomorphic to K^n, so by composition of isomorphisms, X is isomorphic to X'.
[12:01:56] <laurus> But, I was trying to directly find the isomorphism between X and X' without going through K^n
[12:02:03] <int-e> I think it's either using an inner product (which is the notion that makes this independent of a basis) or fix a basis.

[20:13:47] <Z-module> same thing
[20:13:53] <Z-module> I just finished spelling this out
[20:14:10] <cherim> "A continuous f : R -> R for which every f^{-1}(x) is uncountable" -- this is actually a good question. In Moscow, if you started university in September, you'd get it asked this week (after 9th lecture on calculus).

[20:14:34] <[itchyjunk]> I looked around and there isn't actual good definitions of fractals @_@
[20:14:34] <cadmio> ok so G/N = {xN = Nx| x in G} by definition...
[20:14:40] <[itchyjunk]> even though real mathematicians study it
[20:14:41] <Z-module> Batzy: you can write down a simple explicit bijection  {all left cosets of H} -> {all right cosets of H}
[20:14:55] <Z-module> that makes no use of normality of H, nor even of finiteness of G or H
[20:15:05] <Batzy> right, you only need normality to write the quotient group G/H
[20:15:09] <Batzy> alright

[20:21:27] <cadmio> then another thing. In the studying of Sylow's theorem I felt the need to introduce "7.16.7 Lemma" https://gioretikto.github.io/mat/algebra/cauchy_sylow.html but then I realized it seems pretty much the same as "7.16.9 Corollary"
[20:22:26] <Z-module> not the same at all
[20:22:50] <riv> Any conjugate of a sylow subgroup, is a sylow subgroup
[20:22:57] <riv> Any two sylow subgroups are conjugate
[20:23:29] <riv> I wish I had said 'Every' for the first one, that's better
[20:23:57] <[itchyjunk]> what does a conjugate means wrt groups?
[20:24:06] <cadmio> I've consulted also the Hungherfors and indeed it states both propositions
[20:24:28] <riv> [itchyjunk]: r^g = g' r g
[20:24:33] <Batzy> [itchyjunk]: like conjugation by an element?
[20:24:43] <Batzy> oh riv answered, irc didnt auto-scroll
[20:24:48] <riv> and extend this to sets R^g = { g r g in G | r in R }
[20:24:54] <cadmio> "Any two sylow subgroups are conjugate" is justified by the Lemma 7.16.7
[20:25:21] <Z-module> the first can be stated (forget Sylow at all):  If H is any subgroup of G at all, and x is anything in G, then the conjugate  H^x  has the same cardinality as H.       The second says that any two maximal p-subgroups of G (where p divides |G| ) -- that is, any two p-Sylows -- must be conjugates of each other.    This fails for non-maximal p-subgroups, for example the two non-Sylow 2-subgroups  C_2 x {0} , {0} x C_2  of the group C_2 x
[20:25:21] <Z-module> C_2.
[20:25:30] <Batzy> oh conjugate subgroup is like g^-1 H g = K

[20:37:07] *** yotsuba-chan is now known as yotsuba
[20:37:48] <Z-module> a neat thing is that for *solvable* finite groups, this whole Sylow business extends to non-prime-power divisors d of |G| of a special type, specifically d that are coprime to |G|/d.

[21:43:02] <Z-module> The overall result, Pi-sistance, is that conjugation is an operation on C that respects (preserves) all sums, all products, and inverses of all nonzero values. It's a so-called field automorphism.

[21:52:50] <Z-module> Compactness is *such* a powerful and consequential property. For example, if M is a compact metric space, then every isometry M -> M is surjective (thus bijective).
[21:54:36] <Z-module> ALso every compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set. When I first learned this, my thought was, "wtf! so no compact metric space can have larger cardinality than |R| ? wtf?" -- but the issue was that I had in mind the much larger class of compact hausdorff topological spaces, that can be arbitrarily large.

[23:12:45] <audio> in andrew ng's machine learning class on coursera, he represents a function `h_theta(x) = theta_0 + theta_1*x_1 + theta_2*x2 ... theta_n*x_n` with n representing the number of inputs (x). later in the course, he displays a sum of squared errors function as J(theta) = summation( (h_theta(x^i) - y)^2) with x^i denoting a superscript i and not an
[23:12:46] <audio> exponent i. i denotes an index into x, and x is an input vector. but this doesn't make sense. my question is, if we were to actually do `h_theta(x^i)` and give the value of x^i as a parameter to h_theta, we would not have all the Xs (inputs) in h_theta(x) defined, only that particular input. (for example, x^1=300 would translate to h_theta(x) =

[23:40:03] <Decker> uhmm
[23:40:33] <Decker> are rationals repeating too? just irrationals like pi and phi have non repeating?
[23:40:36] <zzz> my question is why can't a *rational* number have *non recurring* points in some base?

[23:41:16] <zzz> i think so
[23:41:48] *** Quits: mornfall (~mornfall@user/mornfall) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[23:42:20] <somiaj> Because since the base is an integer, and you are dividing by an integer, you'll get some cycle, causing the repeating pattern
[23:42:41] *** Quits: audio (~audio@user/audio) (Quit: Client closed)
[23:43:11] <Z-module> Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that dividing any given positive integer by another, only finitely many possible remainders exist.
[23:43:46] <zzz> i'm having truble visualising that

[23:44:31] <somiaj> Z-module's comment follows from the division algorithim, since n = q*d + r, and 0 <= r < d, giving finite number of remainders
[23:45:13] <zzz> oh thanks! i got it

[23:46:45] *** Joins: voices-_ (~voices_@84.238.197.28)
[23:46:57] <Z-module> so as you keep continuing the division, you'll eventually repeat some remainder you had before, then that gives the forever-repeating cycle

[23:58:20] <cuppajoeman> If xy = 0 then one of x or y must be zero right
[23:58:26] <cuppajoeman> I'm trying to prove
[23:58:48] <cuppajoeman> Assume ftsoc both of xy are non-zero, trying to get the cont. that x = 0.
[23:59:10] <cuppajoeman> Is dividing by y both sides a fine proof?
[23:59:11] <Z-module> x, y are reals?
[23:59:18] <Z-module> yes it is, and that's the true proof
[23:59:18] <cuppajoeman> it's a field I think
[23:59:31] <joel135> rather than differentiating e^(-x^2/2) n times, this is somehow completely opposite
[23:59:42] <cuppajoeman> Is doing this in a field more general than in R?
[23:59:42] <Z-module> this is true in every integral domain (a subring of a field), or even a noncommutative ring that lacks zero-divisors
[23:59:49] <Z-module> but not in general rings, of course
[23:59:59] <cuppajoeman> Ok
