[14:23:19] <empwilli_> Is this the right place to ask questions about org-roam-bibtex, as well? When I try to visit a cite: link with org-link-open ~> edit notes, I get an (wront-type-argument listp "string"). Apparently orb-edit-notes is passed the reference as a string. I'm on org-roam-bibtex 0.6 
[14:36:57] <JuhaAutero[m]> I had a similar problem which actually is not at all similar, it just had the same error message. It was caused by Emacs mixing two versions of org. 
[14:37:36] <empwilli_> Ok this could be ... Maybe there's also some native-comp caching in the mix... how did you solve it?
[14:46:32] <JuhaAutero[m]> I think the problem was that when arguments of a function change, all .elc files using that function need to be recompiled, but I don't remember how I recompiled them. 
[14:47:14] <empwilli_> hm; I removed my elpa and eln-cache dirs, let's see whether that fixes taht
[14:47:18] <empwilli_> *that
[14:47:54] <empwilli_> still wonder how I get my emacs to choose the local org installation over the package that was shipped with emacs itself
[14:51:38] <JuhaAutero[m]> There may also been problems caused by package load ordering. If org module x wasn't loaded from local org installation before a package that depended on it was loaded, the dependency would load the one shipped with Emacs.
[14:52:35] <empwilli_> :/
[14:53:59] <empwilli_> It appears as if there is something odd with org anyway; my capture templates currently don't work properly and the mu4e mail address completion is broken as well (and I learned today that this apparently is also somehow hooked up to org-mode)... so I'll investigate on that
[14:54:02] <empwilli_> thanks a lot :)

[16:45:47] <zaeph> I think my co-maint for org-roam-bibtex has already ironed out a lot of the kinks with v2; I'm still not caught up on that front, so you'd have more luck opening issues over there.
