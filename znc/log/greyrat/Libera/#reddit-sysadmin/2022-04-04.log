[10:26:46] <bomb> murder rate in USA is very high, everywhere else feels like a kindergarten
[10:27:12] <SirSceptalot> probably. I wouldn't mind moving to southern france terribly, it's basically motorcycle heaven
[10:27:41] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> I've heard the south of france is quite Nice
[10:27:45] <bomb> hmm, but that's also the tourism part of France
[10:27:45] <SirSceptalot> lol
[10:27:46] <Cl0udNinja> SirSceptalot, anyway.. yeah the nationalist mentality is dug into kids brains from a young age. I could list a number of ways. but it makes the country 'strong' because if something terrible happens it tends to unite them all for that cause/problem, however the downside is that it leads to extreme nationalists who look a lot like russians now and germans in ww2
[10:28:11] <SirSceptalot> yup, spot on Cl0udNinja 
[10:28:15] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> might as well move there at some point, what have you got Toulouse?
[10:28:24] <SirSceptalot> LOL
[10:28:29] <bomb> Cl0udNinja TBH Russians sucked in WW2 as well
[10:28:41] <Cl0udNinja> bomb, yes, but its gotten much worse
[10:28:51] <Cl0udNinja> they were just assholes playing in the war during ww2
[10:29:07] <Cl0udNinja> now they look at lot more like nazis
[10:29:20] <bomb> Stalin attacked Poland simultaneously when Hitler attacked Poland
[10:29:34] <SirSceptalot> the nazi's were more competent though
[10:29:50] <bomb> Ukrainians help Nazis though
[10:29:58] <SirSceptalot> buuuuut maybe let's not turn this into a pissing match about who was evil best :p
[10:30:03] <bomb> maybe we shouldn't get into anthropology now. it's ugly

[10:30:19] <Cl0udNinja> SirSceptalot, neither of the two in the current converstaion are close so yeah :P
[10:30:31] <SirSceptalot> I thought it was somewhat neat
[10:30:35] <bomb> so, how nice is Nice
[10:30:51] <SirSceptalot> there were a number of collaborations that were quite good, like the star wars poster
[10:30:53] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> the truck drivers are a bit aggressive there
[10:30:55] <SirSceptalot> and frankly so much more

[10:31:12] <bomb> Jay too soon

[10:31:17] <Cl0udNinja> yeah
[10:31:20] <Cl0udNinja> its been around for a while
[10:31:26] <SirSceptalot> I thought it just popped up now for this "event"
[10:31:36] <SirSceptalot> though it was just three days of this and then done
[10:31:38] <Cl0udNinja> yeah idk why it suddenly gained a ton of popularity on apr 1
[10:31:48] <bomb> it started in April 1
[10:32:02] <bomb> like, after years of silence
[10:32:38] <bomb> 5 years specifically. last one was on April 1, 2017
[10:33:17] <SirSceptalot> I'm confused. Could you always draw on that thing, or did the sub exist but you can only draw once a year?
[10:33:24] <yuken> Love you SirSceptalot.
[10:33:31] <Cl0udNinja> afaik you could always draw on it from the time it existed
[10:33:34] <bomb> SirSceptalot you couldn't. started on April 1
[10:33:40] <Cl0udNinja> no..
[10:33:44] <Cl0udNinja> I've seen it before
[10:33:45] <SirSceptalot> ok, now I know why I was confused :D
[10:34:09] <bomb> Cl0udNinja LIKE I SAAAAAAAAIIID, it also happened on Aprils fools 2017
[10:34:24] <bomb> revived on April 1, 2022 again
[10:34:28] <Cl0udNinja> yeah, when it came out then, you could always draw on it though
[10:34:33] <Cl0udNinja> even long after apr 1

[16:34:22] <teh_f4ll3n> or a sling
[16:34:30] <SirSceptalot> oh, it was a 5-yr old boy that shot his 2-yr old sister

The thing is, lots of web services on network B are on 1 server so there's a nginx reverse proxy there listening for requests if you go to
[18:06:17] <fruity_tomato> example1.com or exmaple2.com, all on same ip address.

[18:07:03] <fruity_tomato> if i just do a ssh tunnel to 80:80 to a machine in network A, map example1.com to localhost on my PC, would that work?

[21:23:46] <arkanoid> I have simple curiosity. By shuffling the rack server sections of many vendors I see all of them comes with a VGA, but many with a CPU without iGPU nor the possibility to add a dGPU. What's that VGA port for, except bios and motherboard internal stuff?
[21:23:55] <arkanoid> is the VGA provided by the motherboard?

[21:32:08] <arkanoid> which server brand would you suggest? I only know some dell and some hp, but only ancient thinghy (when VGA adapters were explicit on the datasheet) 
[21:32:32] <csws> depends on your requirements and budget
[21:32:47] <csws> an overall sweeping statement from me is: Dell is pretty good
[21:32:59] <csws> their hardware feels a shit load more "premium" than HP
[21:33:03] <csws> and they don't paywall their drivers
[21:33:51] <Hunterkll> eh
[21:33:52] <csws> what are you going to be running on it?
[21:33:56] <Hunterkll> they embedded a 2D GPU into the soc
[21:33:59] <Hunterkll> not a terrible idea
[21:34:10] <arkanoid> I don't remember paywall on HP drivers a dozen years ago
[21:34:20] <csws> it came in a few years ago
[21:34:28] <arkanoid> ok, so dell
[21:34:40] <Hunterkll> HP has paywall for firmware
[21:34:44] <Hunterkll> not drivers
[21:34:45] <csws> if you don't have an active support contract they tell you to GTFO
[21:34:58] <csws> yeah sorry firmware
[21:35:15] <sd> 12<K​anye> HP are kind of shit if you ask me
[21:35:32] <sd> 12<K​anye> And the paywall is just one of the reasons
[21:35:43] <Hunterkll> eh
[21:35:46] <Hunterkll> i like the hardware
[21:35:58] <Hunterkll> it's on par with dell, at least for some lines like the DL380 vs R7xx
[21:36:10] <Hunterkll> and dell indicated a while back they might go the paywall route too
[21:36:38] <csws> I was real impressed with the R740xd at my old job
[21:36:46] <csws> had to chuck FC HBAs in them and they were real easy to work with
[21:36:54] <Hunterkll> CptLuxx: interesting, first way you said it i thought yomeant like, bmc software was doing it, not that they integraded a 2D gpu onto the soc 
[21:36:59] <Hunterkll> integrated

[21:37:12] <csws> rip
[21:37:14] <Hunterkll> the GPU still seems separate (from what i'm reading in this linux kernel source)

[23:15:15] <Hunterkll> you don't need datacenter to run VMs....
[23:15:26] <Hunterkll> but it's cheaper to go datacenter if you have more than 8-9 VMs per host (of windows)

[23:18:27] <sintax> bios maybe then?
[23:18:44] <sintax> Killnine just use raspberry pi's
[23:18:49] <sd> 14<K​illnine> 2x R440s + ME5012 SAN
[23:19:20] <Hunterkll> @Killnine long and short of it is, Standard gives you 2 windows guest VMs licensed (there's no technical limitation on how many you can run, just legal limitations. it won't stop you, and you can run unlmiited other OSes  etc...)
[23:19:42] <Hunterkll> also remember if you're new to 2022, you'll have to get all your 2022 CALs in order for users too
[23:19:44] <Hunterkll> technically
[23:19:46] <Hunterkll> but what you can do
[23:19:51] <Hunterkll> is buy 2x standard licenses to cover the server
[23:19:55] <Hunterkll> and that gives you FOUR licensed guest VMs
[23:20:01] <sd> 14<K​illnine> yeah, I am trying to make that work with our 3x standard servers right now
[23:20:02] *** Joins: PipeItToDevNull4 (~PipeItToD@user/pipeittodevnull)
[23:20:28] <Hunterkll> okay, so standard 16-core is $1069 
[23:20:31] <Hunterkll> Datacenter is $6155
[23:20:35] <sd> 14<K​illnine> haha, yeah
[23:20:47] <Hunterkll> so the breakeven point is 11.51 VMs per host
[23:20:58] <Hunterkll> after that - effectively, if you have more than 11 VMs - datacenter is cheaper
[23:21:06] <sd> 14<K​illnine> You could do a lot of cloud for that, too...
[23:21:13] <Hunterkll> yea, but for how long?
[23:21:20] <Hunterkll> 3 year cost breakdown is going to be a fuckload cheaper than cloud
[23:21:20] <Hunterkll> :)
[23:21:24] <sd> 14<K​illnine> When we have like.... 2 DCs, Print server, file server, a few apps (label making, etc.)
[23:21:33] <Hunterkll> but like i said
[23:21:51] <Hunterkll> just buy 3 standard licenses per host - 6 VMs per host 
[23:21:54] <Hunterkll> and you shold be good for a while
[23:22:06] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Sure, makes sense
[23:22:06] <Hunterkll> upgrade to datacenter with windows server 2024 or whatever
[23:22:10] <Hunterkll> ;P
[23:22:36] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Ugh, and all the CAL licenses dell put on, hah

[23:22:41] *** PipeItToDevNull4 is now known as PipeItToDevNull
[23:22:45] <Hunterkll> well, if you don't have 2022 CALs 
[23:22:47] <Hunterkll> you'll need them
[23:22:50] <Hunterkll> make sure they're user CALs too
[23:22:58] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Yeah they're actually pretty cheap
[23:23:02] <Hunterkll> unless you have 3 or more users per device
[23:23:12] <Hunterkll> at 3 or more users per device, then device CALs make more sense
[23:23:14] <Hunterkll> but that's the break there
[23:23:17] <Hunterkll> 2 or less - user CALs
[23:23:20] <Hunterkll> so you don't have to think about it
[23:23:46] *** Quits: Arlion (~arlion@user/arlion) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:23:48] <Hunterkll> if you go 100% user CALs, that gets rid of the pesky technical bs about DHCP needing CALs since all your users are covered, so unlimited devices (of your users) are covered
[23:23:49] <Hunterkll> :D
[23:24:00] *** Joins: Arlion (~arlion@user/arlion)
[23:24:13] <Hunterkll> like, device cals are a bit - not much mind you - cheaper if you have a 2:1 user:device ratio 
[23:24:22] <Hunterkll> but at that point, spend a bit extra to remove a ton of having to think about shit
[23:24:54] <Hunterkll> trust me, this is easier than trying to figure out some red hat scenarios for licensing, and that's pre-IBM :D 
[23:25:16] <Hunterkll> but like I said, i'd also buy the licenses separately from the hardware, myself
[23:25:32] <Hunterkll> 2-3 years down the line, you replace it with another vendor's shit, you don't have to re0-buy it
[23:25:36] <Hunterkll> OEM licenses live & die with the hardware
[23:26:47] <DrZak> trusting is sad
[23:26:49] <sd> 14<K​illnine> Have you ever used Dell's storage array? They spec'd with 8x 1.2TB 10K HDD. We probably have < 1TB of data total right now. Seems....a bit much. But I don't know how they'd configure those drives for reliability
[23:27:09] <Hunterkll> hm?
[23:27:12] <Hunterkll> I know how i'd configure it 
[23:27:14] <Hunterkll> RAID-6 
[23:27:23] <Hunterkll> in reality, you're losing three drives to redundancy 
[23:27:29] <DrZak> do you even configure raid5 ?
[23:27:31] <Hunterkll> two for RAID-6's parity, and one for hotspare
[23:27:34] <DrZak> these days?
[23:27:46] <Hunterkll> so really, think of it as 5x 1.2TB + redundancy 
[23:28:03] <sd> 15<M​itch the First> I'm trying to identify the location of an unpatched ethernet port on the shop floor, do I have a better option of figuring out which one it is that isn't plugging a transmitter into the shop end and plugging the receiver into every available  port in the panel until one flashes?

[23:32:34] <Hunterkll> you'd just be using iscsi over network most likely ...

[23:32:40] <Hunterkll> just make a separate iscsi vlan on your switch
[23:32:43] <Hunterkll> doesn't even need to reach the router
