[01:34:27] <Nanobot> Three grocery deliveries ago, I ordered some strawberry yogurt, but the delivery guy forgot it. The next time, I ordered strawberry yogurt, but gave me greek yogurt instead (which, as far as I can tell, is simply spoiled milk). Yesterday, I ordered groceries again, and I finally got strawberry yogurt. I went to get one just now, and the expiration date is today.
[01:35:05] <Bco1981> hurry and eat it
[01:35:24] <Nanobot> No. They always expire before the expiration date. I'm just writing it off as another loss.
[01:35:34] <Bco1981> hm
[01:36:09] <S_T_A_N> Nanobot, no they don't...
[01:36:51] <Nanobot> Back before the pandemic, when I would go to the store myself, I'd always buy yogurt that didn't expire for another two weeks. But it was really only good for about one week, and then the flavor would start to get more acidic and kinda gross.
[01:37:32] <Nanobot> I think the expiration date is the danger mark, but the flavor turns well before then.
[01:38:33] <Nanobot> Then again, milk is always 100% bad a few days before the expiration date, so maybe this area just has issues with dairy shipments.
[01:39:46] <Bco1981> that's some bad milk you got overthere. or too long expected expiration dates.

[02:32:10] <Nanobot> Primates evolved to experience ASMR because it encouraged interpersonal grooming, which offered evolutionary benefits. ASMR was most strongly triggered by the sensations of someone gently fingering through your hair. Hundreds of thousands of years later, people discover that this can often be triggered purely through audio, by replicating the kinds of sounds that you would hear during the grooming. A decade later, the concept was lost entirely and 
[02:32:11] <Nanobot> devolved into white noise and sex.
[02:33:20] <MootPoot> rain and hair combing sounds does it for me

[03:02:30] <Nanobot> watch stuff or listen to "ASMR" videos and fall asleep.
[03:03:06] <Nanobot> The daily breakdown isn't consistent. It's just whatever is happening that day. Most days, I have no meetings and just work on tickets/emails/whatever projects have been in the works.
[03:04:12] <MootPoot> oh

[03:16:42] <lastonestanding> we will need a yearly booster vaccination from now on?
[03:17:04] <theholyduck> probably not?
[03:17:24] <theholyduck> lastonestanding:  so far the booster talk is more for people with weakened imune systems
[03:17:43] <theholyduck> lastonestanding:  and the vaccines we have are still mostly effective on the mutated variants. 
[03:18:07] <theholyduck> like how long a vaccine last depends on the vaccine type and what its trying to protect you against
[03:18:31] <theholyduck> some vaccines gives you decades of protection if not lifetime
[03:18:40] <theholyduck> some only last for months or years
[03:18:53] <theholyduck> these are the first mRNA vaccines so.. who really knows
[03:19:13] <lastonestanding> the pharma companies should know
[03:19:27] <lastonestanding> "Pfizer data suggest third dose of Covid-19 vaccine 'strongly' boosts protection against Delta variant"
[03:19:49] <theholyduck> pharma companies also want to sell even more doses
[03:20:19] <theholyduck> i dont think any country thinks the third booster makes sense yet
[03:20:38] <theholyduck> and they all have medical experts looking at it aswell
[03:21:00] <lastonestanding> uhm
[03:21:06] <lastonestanding> check this out...
[03:21:10] <lastonestanding> "Germany to secure 204 million Covid vaccine ‚Äòbooster‚Äô doses for 2022"
[03:21:25] <lastonestanding> can you explain that?
[03:21:46] <lastonestanding> why secure something that is not needed?
[03:21:54] <lastonestanding> I'm confused
[03:22:23] <lastonestanding> to me it looks like everyone will have to get the booster
[03:22:40] <lastonestanding> otherwise your status of being vaccinated will be revoked
[03:25:04] <lastonestanding> it's like Office 365 :D
[03:26:21] <lastonestanding> "Rockstar Games is in the late stages of remastering the classics Grand Theft Auto III, Grand Theft Auto Vice City, and Grand Theft Auto San Andreas in Unreal Engine according to a new report."
[03:26:33] <theholyduck> as far as i know the german boosters will be for people who took the less effective vaccines
[03:26:42] <theholyduck> and people who have reduced imune response
[03:26:44] <theholyduck> and might need a booster
[03:27:23] <lastonestanding> basically everyone I think
[03:28:27] <lastonestanding> I mean how do you know who will need a booster and who will not?
[03:28:39] <lastonestanding> individually
[03:28:58] <Sxem> ooh, maybe i shdnt do san andreas then
[03:29:09] <Sxem> its like #3 in my backlog

[03:29:50] <lastonestanding> so I don't get why they want to use unreal
[03:30:26] <Sxem> or will san andreas only be remastered for consoles
[03:31:06] <lastonestanding> I would just play it now

[11:12:44] <theholyduck> they are the people who made ping poing the animation 
[11:12:48] <emmeka> it's not a sequel or anything, but just re-uses the characters. but this new one seems like it'll be an actual sequel, or well, will have about as much continuity as Tatami Galaxy can muster

[11:29:01] <emmeka> as I watch more anime with my wife, when we do watch subs, we generally watch French subs which is uh interesting for me
[11:29:19] <theholyduck> i dunno how much of an impact C is 
[11:29:22] <emmeka> as I don't really have the skill of speed-reading French as much as I do English, but she finds speed-reading English too difficult

[11:51:48] <emmeka> on the plus side, drowned didn't exist, so you weren't evading those trident things they have now

[18:26:58] <KatrinValerie> sparkwitch: the mid-term goal is to make it a hybrid.
[18:27:22] <KatrinValerie> Short term we are upgrading to a 4-stroke harley copycat engine

[18:27:57] <KatrinValerie> That will reduce emissions and slightly increase horse power
[18:28:20] <KatrinValerie> With the hybrid rebuild, we will exchange the breaks with electric motors

[18:49:06] <Sadale> basuotoko, Thank you everyone! The [ten to twenty] songs that I've just sung was recorded* before I went to Japan. I went to Japan back in 1974. I was there for 5-6 years. In Japan, the quality of music is very high. However, as for other aspects, like my romatic relationships, there hasn't been much progress. That's why I'm getting back to Hong Kong and see if there'd be any opportunities. Up next is a couple of songs that I've recorded* them Japan. (*I 
[18:49:06] <Sadale> suspect that "record" could actually mean release here based on the context. Maybe old Cantonese wordings or jargon?)

[18:49:45] <basuotoko> well, she is not native Cantonese speak that is probably why, never mind. let me read what you wrote.
[18:50:06] <basuotoko> Sadale, Awesome, now they make great sense now. 
[18:50:24] <Sadale> basuotoko, oh. That's why I've noticed that she's got a bit of accent. It's comprehensible to me tho
[18:51:10] <basuotoko> Sadale, haha, ok, btw, if you would allow me to, i am having other parts from her, she does not speeck too much though, when you are free, i will try to hand them to you please.
[18:51:39] <Sadale> basuotoko, sure. I'll help when I've got the time. As long as those aren't too long and as long as I've got the time, I'm cool with helping :3
[18:51:44] <Sadale> basuotoko, so you speak Mandarin?
[18:51:47] <basuotoko> let me review the contents i am having in handy.

[22:36:42] <JesseDesu2> i hate my plumbing
[22:36:56] <emmeka> MootPoot Netflix has singlehandedly revived fansubs, which is how impressively bad they are with anime
[22:37:03] <JesseDesu2> roommate put a new nozzle in for a quick disconnect for a portable dishwasher
[22:37:18] <emmeka> it took them 6 months to release Beastars S2, enough time that it actually got proper fansubs within a week of the Japanese release
[22:37:22] <JesseDesu2> i think the pressure blew off the kitchen sprayer 
[22:37:40] <emmeka> like they're operating on release schedules that haven't been acceptable for 10 years

[22:37:59] <emmeka> Netflix originals means nothing
[22:38:12] <MootPoot> they only exist because of netflix money
[22:38:17] <emmeka> all it means is that Netflix was the producer, ie, they threw money at a studio and told them to make it happen
[22:38:38] <MootPoot> I mean, yeah; but it simply would not exist without netflix there
[22:38:40] <emmeka> JesseDesu2 yeah, a bit. I did all the plumbing on the house my dad and I built.

[22:39:01] <MootPoot> sure he didnt do any engineering work, but that engineering work would have never been able to happen without him
[22:39:10] <JesseDesu2> the water pressure blew off the kitchen sprayer nozzle
[22:39:22] <JesseDesu2> i capped it off with a brass plug
[22:39:28] <JesseDesu2> and some teflon tape
[22:39:37] <JesseDesu2> i dont trust it hold tho
[22:39:50] <JesseDesu2> i think the dishwasher quick disconnect is to blame
[22:40:06] <emmeka> MootPoot many Netflix "original" anime aren't even actually Netflix-produced, they're just exclusively licensed by Netflix after production.

[22:42:09] <JesseDesu2> emmeka i'm a little pissed that the new roommate changed the configuration of the sink
[22:42:14] *** duds-_ is now known as duds-
[22:42:37] <JesseDesu2> yea my landlord doesnt wanna pay for jack shit
[22:43:28] <emmeka> when I rented from a landlord who didn't fix shit, I just notified him promptly, waited a week, and then fixed it myself and handed him a bill along with rent minus the bill.
[22:44:35] <MootPoot> haven't watched any anime at all this season
[22:44:41] <JesseDesu2> yea i'm not sure if my landlord will accept that kind of payment
[22:44:42] <MootPoot> been preoocupied wth genshin
[22:44:48] <MootPoot> or getting yelled at work
[22:44:53] <emmeka> he was sort of annoyed about it at first, but what was he gonna do? he was legally obligated to fix shit, and didn't.
[22:45:11] <emmeka> MootPoot you're missing a pretty good season
[22:45:23] <MootPoot> is it?
[22:45:27] <emmeka> JesseDesu2 that's why I literally just subtracted it from rent.
[22:45:35] <MootPoot> aside from dragon waifu all I've been hearing is meh
[22:45:39] <emmeka> because he had no choice but to either accept it, or attempt to evict me.
[22:45:49] <JesseDesu2> emmeka if i hire a plumber my lanlord always complains that i didnt find the cheapest price or some shit
[22:46:09] <JesseDesu2> always something
[22:46:09] <Bco1981> JesseDesu2: then he could have done it him self...
[22:46:19] <emmeka> well I wouldn't hire someone, I just did it myself and gave a pretty lowball idea of what it'd cost
[22:46:32] <emmeka> but you could hire someone, and then it's his problem
[22:46:47] <Bco1981> if he is like that, i would have been tempted to get the more pricy one every time.
[22:46:48] <MootPoot> kick the can into your landlords apartment
[22:46:55] <emmeka> the only thing is, make sure you notify him in a proveable way about the problem well before you attempt to fix it
[22:47:00] <MootPoot> swap your broken faucet with his working one
[22:47:01] <MootPoot> lmao
[22:47:28] <emmeka> except that would be B&E and very stupid.
[22:47:33] <KatrinValerie> emmeka: meow meow, we cut our rent too when the tub was borked
[22:47:37] <JesseDesu2> ugh this is a real problem
[22:47:44] <JesseDesu2> the dishes are piling up
[22:47:49] <MootPoot> emmeka:  only if he can prove it
[22:47:54] <JesseDesu2> and it smells gross
[22:47:55] <KatrinValerie> JesseDesu2: do the dishes then
[22:47:55] <emmeka> JesseDesu2 have you told the landlord? 
[22:48:13] <KatrinValerie> Damage control is sometimes better than proving a point
[22:48:18] <JesseDesu2> KatrinValerie, did you not read
[22:48:22] <KatrinValerie> No
[22:48:25] <JesseDesu2> how can i wash dishes with a broken faucet
[22:48:29] <emmeka> if you've told him and he refuses to fix it, just get it done yourself and hand the bill in with rent.
[22:48:44] <KatrinValerie> JesseDesu2: bucket
[22:48:51] <JesseDesu2> fucket
[22:48:55] <KatrinValerie> and get someone to fix it
[22:49:04] <KatrinValerie> and substract the bill from da rent
[22:49:14] <JesseDesu2> yea
[22:49:19] <KatrinValerie> JesseDesu2: you can do the dishes in hte bahttubr
[22:49:49] <JesseDesu2> i'm going to complain to the landlord that the new roommate's portable dishwasher somehow ruined our sink
