[04:04:09] <dpkg> irc.debian.org moved to OFTC on June 4th 2006, see http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/05/msg00012.html . Operators and bots (see <fact sharing>) can also be found on <libera>. Questions? Ask in #debian on one or other network. See also http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/04/msg00333.html
[04:04:36] <randall> duuude: This is just an inofficial support channel for Debian here.
[04:05:02] <indyZ> I forget about oftc. Are there still a lot of open source projects there? In my mind libera is the go-to

[04:28:31] <duuude> randall: what is wrong with a mirror bot?
[04:29:14] <sney> debian has maintained the two #debian channels for a long time and there's no reason to change that now
[04:29:21] <duuude> less friction with the need to register at fewer places

[04:30:28] <sney> besides, the libera/oftc communities are not identical, and there's nothing wrong with that either
[04:30:51] <duuude> sney: no I mean, wouldn't it get better? There are other channels as well that don't exist on Libera except #debian, one doesn't need to join on both sides in those cases.
[04:31:17] <sney> I highly, highly doubt that anything would improve.
[04:31:40] <sney> the closest you'll get to mirroring is this:
[04:31:43] <sney> !fact sharing
[04:31:43] <dpkg> I show the same facts on both <libera> and <OFTC>.  If you update a fact on one network, it will show up on the other network.
[04:32:01] <indyZ> duuude: I think channel forwarders are usually hard on the eyes, unless they make clever use of colors. Then it's hard on the eyes in a different way :)
[04:32:40] <indyZ> but I think it might make sense for a tiny channel like #debian-next on libera.

[13:01:58] <blacked> If i want to use that pop-shell, i can compile it and use if , like after someday, if debian adds gnome-40 , then probably pop-shell will not work or get bug , as it is not updating constantly
[13:03:02] <Khepra> why don't just use pop!_os and get the full experience.
[13:03:18] <Khepra> it's based on ubuntu which is based on debian, so win-win-win.

[13:05:18] <Khepra> well the pop!_os shell is really designed to operate on pop!_os, depending exactly on all those 222s you wish to avoid :)

[13:56:41] <Khepra> offtopic here, but in my experience building gaming VMs, insufficient RAM, even if "unused" meant increased use of the pagefile and IO

[13:58:15] <Khepra> files are terrible for performance.
[13:58:51] <Khepra> the guest OS thinks it works with block device and utilizes patterns relying on that. but the host is using a file which is subject to filesystem mechanics
[13:58:53] <TheBigK> file
[13:59:36] <Khepra> for starters, see that the VM is usio direct io, no host side caching
[13:59:55] <Khepra> second, which driver is used for disk -- virtio? use virtio, red hat has windows guest virtio drivers
[14:00:30] <Khepra> third, if at all possible, don't use files. use block devices. whole partitions, or LVM LVs. zfs zvols (thought this requires tuning)

[14:05:56] <Khepra> just make sure you install the red hat's drivers _first_ before switching the VM to virtio on the host/qemu-system side
[14:06:46] <Khepra> actually, red hat has an ISO which you can attach to the VM and go straight to virtio through the windows installer, but if you're almost done with it, then just do it after the whole initial setup phase

[15:58:17] <jelly> I wonder how qemu passes kernel and initrd to the guest
[15:59:35] <jelly> Megaf, iso can be helpful because it's selfcontained; if you use separate linux and initrd.gz you need to remember to update them every time there's a new point release for current debian
[16:00:03] <jelly> so when 11.3 is out, kernel and initrd you downloaded before stop working correctly
[16:00:15] <Khepra> I don't think there's much difference from "regular" boot. you mimic bios in that you execute code from somewhere: be it first sector on the storage media, or a binary blob (kernel) from outside
[16:00:30] <Khepra> technically it should be the same hypervisor context in both cases
[16:00:44] <Megaf> jelly, I mean, using the initrd and kernel just for the installer, after install is complete then one just boot straight from the disk image
[16:01:21] <jelly> Megaf, yeah.  Once 11.3 is out, old installer files will stop working
[16:01:40] <Khepra> jelly: do you mean 11.next in general, or 11.3 specifically?

[16:03:47] <Megaf> This is one thing SliTaz does well. It's a tiny distro, that can boot straight from their one PXE servers
[16:04:01] <Megaf> their own*
[16:04:37] <Megaf> You get a small ISO, and this ISO has a PXE thing that chainloads to the latest installer from their servers
[16:04:50] *** Joins: cdown (~cdown@188.214.11.14)
[16:05:20] <jelly> Khepra, the initrd is not self-contained, parts of the installer are fetched from a mirror
[16:05:38] <Megaf> And the live version is totally resident in ram, you don't need the media to keep the OS running. Once I got nearly all PCs on my C++ classroom running SliTaz
[16:06:15] <jelly> that can include parts that ship eg. ext4.ko matching the installer kernel
[16:06:28] <Megaf> Khepra, he is just saying that if you download an initrd and kernel for 11.3, those will only install 11.3, once 11.4 is out, you need to update them both
[16:07:08] <jelly> if your VM provisioning method breaks after a point release, then you know why
[16:07:33] <Megaf> By the way, this is my go-to ISO to deploy Debian locally. https://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/stable/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/mini.iso It's a 48 MB Installer only ISO. It will download everything updated from Debian mirrors
[16:09:08] <jelly> we keep a local mirror, 48MB, 1TB, same difference
[16:09:13] * jelly hides
[16:10:08] <Megaf> Why use a small file that will get everything quick over the broad pipe when you can keep an outdated gigantic and complex local mirror?
[16:11:14] <Khepra> with local mirrors you prevent crap like that nodejs subversion
[16:12:12] <Khepra> any deployment more serious than "herp Imma toy with lee nuks nao!" should have local mirrors, carefully updated and audited. the sht has hit the fan, it's now SeriousBusiness(tm) and the supply chain has long become untrustable.

[16:14:41] <labrador> But apt has signature verification Khepra
[16:14:44] <Khepra> from developer to her or his git hub. from that git hub to maintainer's computer. <build build>. from maintainers computer to debian primary uploads. from tehre to mirrors. from mirros to your computer.
[16:14:55] <Megaf> labrador, hacking debian itself might be a little too hard, so someone by hack one of the packages in the contrib repo for example
[16:14:56] <Khepra> labrador: so? do you know what happened to nodejs recently?
[16:15:28] <labrador> Khepra, yeah that was developer poisoning his own packages
[16:15:34] <Khepra> signed packages only --- AND ONLY --- protect against third party who cannot subvert the key. NOTHING else.
[16:15:50] <labrador> But debian tests packages right
[16:15:50] <Khepra> there's an unknown size of potential threat actors who CAN subvert the keys.
[16:16:01] <Megaf> wordpress recently had thousands if not tens of thousands or more websites hacked with backdoors installed because a plugin/theme website from a third party got hacked
[16:16:03] <labrador> So it will caught in unstable or something
[16:16:19] <Khepra> labrador: debian is an abstract term. a distro. debian doesn't do anything. people do. so which people are you referring to?
[16:16:52] <labrador> Khepra, uhh other people than the dev poisoning his packages ig
[16:17:06] <labrador> All others in debian would notice
[16:17:37] <Khepra> so basically you're talking about how _probable_ something is. in debian, it's improbable due to all the mechanisms of verification. but that's not absolute. it's erroor prone. it's definitely not invulnerable to malice from within.

[16:18:42] <labrador> oh
[16:19:21] <Khepra> and again things are not black and white, and some packages might be caught sooner than that -- bigger packages, maintained by teams, tested by more people so the problem is caught while still in proposed-updates, or in sid

[16:21:52] <Khepra> so I find it amusing when some people get deluded about security practices saying they dont' trust this or that, but they apparently ignore the fact that they DO trust the maintainers, implicitly. and infra admins. and mirror admins. whole lot of people must be trusted in the supply chain from the developer him/her self down to end user.

[16:22:34] <Khepra> this is exactly, btw, why reproducible builds is important, and why the plans to introduce signage of the whole chain so you can verify it from the developer's own key, down to your own
[16:22:46] <labrador> And read the source code of all packages you use
[16:22:57] <Khepra> but alas, that will never protect against malicious dev, like that nodejs guy recently

[18:32:16] <kittonian> hi all. i've got two scripts that need to be run in order and have one in the network interfaces file as a pre-up and the other in the crontab @reboot. Just tried rebooting the server and noticed that the @reboot is running before the network interface is brought up so it failed. Should these both be in the network interfaces file as two separate pre-up lines?

[18:51:10] <judd> Package iptables-persistent (admin, optional) in bullseye/amd64: boot-time loader for netfilter rules, iptables plugin. Version: 1.0.15; Size: 12.2k; Installed: 47k

[18:53:19] <kittonian> are you saying to switch to a new iptables?
[18:53:26] <kittonian> i have this server all setup
[18:53:36] <randall> kittonian: The interface doesn't need to be up to add iptables rules.
[18:53:46] <kittonian> it does
[18:53:54] <randall> kittonian: How so?
[18:54:03] <kittonian> it doesn't for the first script, but it does for the second because I'm calling to spamhaus for some of the rules
[18:54:08] <randall> kittonian: Show me the logs that show your error then.
[18:54:09] <kittonian> which means I need an internet connection
[18:54:58] <kittonian> the error was simply that the chain didn't exist because the @reboot ran before the pre-up script
[18:55:06] <kittonian> it's no big deal, i'm just trying to resolve the issue
[18:55:25] <randall> So you have two parts that depend on each other? Why not make it a single one then?
[18:55:31] <kittonian> so I removed the @reboot and instead inserted a post-up /bin/bash /path/to/script.sh line in the interfaces file
[18:56:07] <kittonian> one script needs to run BEFORE the interface is up (hence the pre-up line) and the other AFTER the interface is up
[18:56:15] <kittonian> can't do it in one file because of that
[18:56:24] *** Quits: duuude (~user@user/duuude) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[18:56:51] <kittonian> I just want to confirm that my post-up line is correct as the pre-up line had to be pre-up /bin/sh /path/to/iptables.rules where iptables.rules was chmod 644 and had no #!/bin/bash at the top
[18:57:01] *** Quits: goopsiet (~klmsadosi@177.25.177.224) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[18:57:18] <kittonian> so my question is whether I also need to remove the #!/bin/bash from my iptables.sh script and set the post-up to post-up /bin/sh /path/to/iptables.sh
[18:57:44] <kittonian> or if I can use post-up /bin/bash /path/to/iptables.sh and leave in the #!/bin/bash line of the script
[18:57:50] <randall> kittonian: If you're calling the script with `/bin/sh /path/to/script.sh` the shebang is irrelevant. That's only used if you call it directly as `/path/to/script.sh`, where it also needs the x bit set.
[18:57:54] <kittonian> the post-up script calls to 3 other scripts
[18:58:18] <kittonian> ok, so just post-up /path/to/iptables.sh
[18:59:58] <kittonian> easy enough. thanks

[21:00:33] <somiaj> also note it isn't uncommon in sid that some packages are uninsatallable, and this can sometimes mess with metapackages that are holding things in.

[21:01:41] <somiaj> dependency trees of the big desktops like the main gnome metapackage are complicated, and it wouldn't be uncommon for some issue in sid causing the package to have issues (some run testing for this very reason)
[21:02:39] <jmcnaught> royaleconqueso: network-manager and network-manager-gnome are usually installed automatically as dependencies of meta-packages for desktop environments.  If you remove some of those meta packages depending on network-manager then apt will think the package is not required anymore and offer it for autoremove.

[21:53:42] <Khepra> that's your answer then. kernel revisions are individual packages. 5.10.0-9, that -9 is revision. bullseye is at -11 now I think. they get installed as dependencies pulled in by the metapackage
[21:57:29] <somiaj> It isn't really a revision (those aren't part of package names, but part of versions
[21:57:32] <somiaj> !kernel abi
[21:57:32] <dpkg> Debian kernel packages have an <ABI> to indicate when out-of-tree modules must be rebuilt; upgrading from a package with 3.2.0-3-amd64 to another 3.2.0-3-amd64 doesn't require fglrx/nvidia/etc to be rebuilt, but upgrading from 3.2.0-3-amd64 to 3.2.0-4-amd64 does.  Development kernels intended for <experimental> have the ABI <trunk> to indicate the ABI is unmanaged.  http://wiki.debian.org/DebianKernelABIChanges
[21:57:38] <Siamand> thank you, in apt list --installed i can see jus "linux-image-5.10.0-9-amd64/stable,now 5.10.70-1 amd64 [installed]" means isn't automatic
[21:58:10] <somiaj> not all upgrades change the abi, but many do
[21:58:15] <Khepra> Siamand: actually those are part of the package name. that's the whole reason they need the meta to "upgrade"
[21:58:47] <Khepra> for example,   linux-image-5.10.0-11-amd64  is package name.  version of the package is   5.10.92-1
[21:59:12] <Siamand> Khepra, ok i do install meta right now. Thanks again
[21:59:34] <Khepra> it's a bit confusing, beacuse for the duration of bullseye, that will always be 5.10.0-<something>, as that just denotes teh branch of the kernel major version

[22:02:57] <Kerr> Hi guys, I'm on KDE Plasma (if that matters) and while I can set the correct audio device group to use (HDMI Audio) in the little speaker in the tray, the exact device in the group I select resets every time the screen locks. I have HDMI Audio 3, HDMI Audio 4, and HDMI Audio 6 in the same category, where HDMI Audio 3 is a monitor with no speakers, and the one it defaults back to...
[22:03:10] *** Joins: finsternis (~X@23.226.237.192)
[22:03:31] <Kerr> How would I get it to stay on HDMI Audio 6?

[22:04:25] *** Joins: Clarth (~Clarth@23.226.133.71)
[22:04:45] <Kerr> hmm. Good Question, Manually locking the screen doesn't cause this - only when the screen turns off (and locks) for inactivity (I just checked)
[22:05:06] <somiaj> It is probably once the screen turns off, the sound card goes away, and then comes back when the screen turns back on
[22:05:35] <Kerr> Foo. You are probably right, come to think of it, when a screen is off in windows it's audio device disappears also
[22:05:37] <somiaj> I have had this issue with things I plug into the usb ports of my monintor, but for me the sound card doesn't reset like you. But maybe your monintor is different
[22:05:50] <Kerr> It's just probably different priority
[22:06:10] <Kerr> Hopes for fix > ~.trash
[22:06:17] <somiaj> now as to how to configure pulseaudio to switch to this new device automatically when it turns back on, I can't really help you there, maybe google can help to see if this is possible

[22:06:49] <Khepra> Kerr: as you noted, it happend on windows too. that's just the nature of hdmi audio. hilarity ensues on laptops when that changes audio output and your laptop speakers start to blare even though hdmi output is muted

[22:09:01] <Kerr> somiaj yes
[22:09:32] <Kerr> It's also displayport, while the other two are older HDMI Monitors (they all show up as displayport/hdmi audio actually, now that I think about it)
[22:09:42] <somiaj> Kerr: that is probably what it is doing, is just choosing the primary monintor. Could you change which monitor is primary
[22:10:14] <Kerr> ah, I figured it picked the lowest number. I'll see one sec
[22:10:26] <somiaj> Kerr: it might be possible to configure pulseaudio to prefer certain sound cards when it sees them and switch to them. It might be possible to write a script that will switch to this one card automatically. I would have to google and dig deeper to know if it is possible and try it
[22:11:14] <Kerr> I'm still loving ym switch to debian, but little stuff like this kills non-techies

[22:12:01] <Khepra> hdmi (and blueooth) are terrible even on windows.
[22:12:33] <Kerr> bluetooth is terrible everywhere. I don't get how a standard meant to make interconnecting devices easy can be so abyssmally bad
[22:13:03] <Kerr> Not helped by the fact most bluetooth devices are shit quality
[22:13:47] <Kerr> However, Windows correctly keeps track of which monitor to use audio on
[22:13:55] <Kerr> and switches to it when available
[22:14:39] <Khepra> frankly, I'm not sure of that. the laptop hiliarity I mentioned above is real experience
[22:14:57] <Khepra> possibly because it's not two hdmi outputs, but hdmi + laptop's internal
[22:14:58] <Kerr> The laptop would probably switch back after opening the lid though
[22:15:21] <Khepra> not always
[22:15:42] <Khepra> and audio would always mess up. switch to internal speakers instead of remaining through hdmi
