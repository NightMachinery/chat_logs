[14:36:42] <glizzster[m]1> why do people dont use laptops from System76
[14:38:37] <Hemish[m]> Because we need cheap second hand laptops, my laptop is i5 8th gen, 8 gigs ram, 7sed only 6-7 months, there are just some marks on screen, else it is all good, got It in 18000 rupee. It's still in warantee. Offline market is so great. This now runs Arch Linux, Void Linux and Linux mint (linux mint is backup os if something goes wrong)
[14:38:47] <Hemish[m]> *used

[20:30:33] <Arya[m]> every wm has it
[20:30:48] <Arya[m]> heck imo sway does floating very well way better than dwm
[20:31:06] <Arya[m]> and i do use dynamic tiling in sway with i3ipc-dynamic-tiling
[20:51:03] <gtlsgamr> I use dwm because it was my first and now I don't want to switch because I'm too used to the binds
[20:51:49] <Hemish[m]> <Arya[m]> "and i do use dynamic tiling in..." <- What is dynamic tiling? Btw I also use sway
