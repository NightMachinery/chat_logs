[03:14:18] <FunkyBob> rannnn8888: if you're trying to run django in production, you don't use "manage.py runserver"
[03:14:30] <FunkyBob> if you're running it locally for development, you mostly don't need apache
[03:14:58] <FunkyBob> at a guess the problem is you haven't loaded the mod-wsgi module... but it's been so so long since I used apache
[03:15:04] <rannnn8888> it not for development, i want run the site in my server
[03:15:16] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: small note... not everyone here is 'guys'
[03:15:48] <Steve-Dusty> ... ok
[03:16:02] <Steve-Dusty> you can call women "guys" too...
[03:16:16] <FunkyBob> that doesn't mean everyone will identfiy as a 'guy'
[03:16:18] <dre> Steve-Dusty, What's the view code?
[03:16:27] <Steve-Dusty> -_-  ok
[03:16:33] <FunkyBob> and guy is not universally gender neutral...

[03:17:36] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob ok one problem slove i forget setup the libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3 :x
[03:17:53] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: so... when you say the button is 'blocking'...
[03:18:08] <FunkyBob> is this an issue of hierarchy?

[03:18:56] <Steve-Dusty> yes
[03:19:02] <Steve-Dusty> it's an issue of hierarchy
[03:19:58] <dre> So with forms, any submit button will actually submit the whole form. it's something to do with the html spec, not django, I believe.
[03:21:09] <dre> Steve-Dusty, you are wanting a "formset" here. The choices is a formset. like a little "mini-form" within your form

[03:22:58] <dre> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/django-formsets/
[03:24:01] <dre> I think the issue might be that you're looking for that reactivity of, like, "dynamically add choices to the form before you submit" - Django isn't quite designed that way per-say. but theres' hacks to do it I suppose

I'm trying to make a Polls app. This polls app is not your usual Django polls app. It's extremely flexible as it should be. Users can choose to create a poll with whatever options and however many of them there are. The problem is
[03:41:08] <Steve-Dusty> this. Users make them together at once. This means that  once the user create a choice, the choice model cannot add the foreignkey of "Question" immediately, because it hasn't been created yet! My brilliant mind came up with a way to solve this. I'll occupy each model - Question and Choice - with a new field called "code". Whenever the user goes to
[03:41:08] <Steve-Dusty> "createpoll" url, they'll be generated a random code. The question will be saved with that ran-

[04:14:28] <Steve-Dusty> does anyone here know prettyprinted?
[04:14:31] <PaulWay[w]> wallbroken: I'd recommend reading about pagination in the context of web pages, then ask again.
[04:14:39] <wallbroken> it will add 16 other new items
[04:14:46] <PaulWay[w]> Pagination is probably what you mean.
[04:14:46] <FunkyBob> it does not require javascript, unless you want it to automatically load more without a page reload
[04:15:00] <wallbroken> but it's nothing related to django?
[04:15:08] <PaulWay[w]> Django can do that for you.

[04:15:42] <Steve-Dusty> ohh
[04:15:45] <Steve-Dusty> so that's not pagination
[04:15:49] <Steve-Dusty> pagination = multiple pages
[04:15:56] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: then you will need javacript...
[04:16:06] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: it uses the pagination mechanisms...

[06:16:31] <dre> is it possible to have a "unique_together" field in django, that sorta checks date/periods.
[06:17:07] <PaulWay[w]> There is but I don't think it's unique_together.
[06:17:41] <dre> you can't quite put annotations in unique_together can you ^_^
[06:18:16] <dre> I'm thinking like, i hvae 3 fields: `type` `date_from` `date_to` -> i want to make it so you can't have the same type with overlapping date_from/date_to
[06:18:21] <PaulWay[w]> No, but you can do something like that with the field itself IIRC.
[06:18:46] <PaulWay[w]> I think you mean a constraint that date_to cannot be earlier than date_from.

[06:23:46] <GinFuyou> dre, there is date range field for PG iirc
[06:24:38] <PaulWay[w]> You then have to be aware of the '('/')' and '['/']' ideas for date ranges.
[06:24:42] <dre> can you make constraints refer to the model being saved? (I'm assuming these are checked at save time) like --> check=Q(effective_to__gt=F('effective_from')) # constrain effective_to is after effective_from

[07:33:03] <Stece-Dusty> if I finish that polls app would I be promoted from noob in Django?

[07:33:27] <dre> Stece-Dusty, yes, we ship out a medal to you
[07:33:33] <PaulWay[w]> Heh.
[07:33:35] <Stece-Dusty> :D
[07:33:43] <Stece-Dusty> I'll finish it by this week
[07:34:08] <hemebond> After seeing some of the questions and discussions in here recently maybe we should send people a medal if they complete the tutorial 😆
[07:34:39] <Stece-Dusty> i meant my own more advanced version
[07:34:48] <PaulWay[w]> hemebond: heh.
[07:35:09] <PaulWay[w]> Stece-Dusty: that's a good idea.  Just keep on plugging away trying to do stuff.

[07:43:09] <schinckel> hemebond: Maybe we should add a final step to the tutorial that generates a certificate and prints it out.
[07:44:05] <Stece-Dusty> certificates are worthless -_-
[07:44:17] <Stece-Dusty> i prefer a fundamental django exam
[07:44:24] <PaulWay[w]> Heh
[07:45:12] <PaulWay[w]> We'll just have to write an automated test suite - give it a URL and it tests that you've implemented the tutorial parts in the way it says.
[07:45:21] <Stece-Dusty> universities don't give 2 craps bout an undocumented certificate
[07:46:34] <Stece-Dusty> or stufff
[07:46:39] <Stece-Dusty> that'd be hard
[07:46:58] <Stece-Dusty> you need scraping and stuff
[07:48:14] <schinckel> PaulWay[w]: Back when I was at uni we used to submit compiled applications and they would be run against a test suite, and we'd get marks based on the number of failures.
[07:48:40] <PaulWay[w]> Yep.
[07:48:53] <PaulWay[w]> This is how Red Hat implements its exams.
[07:49:31] <PaulWay[w]> You're given a bunch of things that your test system has to do (e.g. allow user X to log in, act as a SaMBa server, deny access on this port, etc).
[07:49:42] <PaulWay[w]> Then the automated test suite tests how many of those things it can do.
[07:49:49] <PaulWay[w]> Objective and fast to check.
[07:50:16] <Stece-Dusty> remember ldap?
[07:52:01] <PaulWay[w]> I tried to forget it but I failed.
[07:52:07] <PaulWay[w]> :-)
[07:54:34] <PaulWay[w]> Stece-Dusty: but yes, you have a story about LDAP?
[07:54:53] <Stece-Dusty> no my mom told me about it

[11:00:31] <serafeim> there's no way these can be upgraded
[11:00:56] <serafeim> the problem is that pip is not working anymore in old python versions because of SSL things
[11:01:34] <serafeim> so i had to upgrade python by compiling 2.7.18 by hand
[11:02:45] <GinFuyou> Wow, sounds not fun ^_^"
[11:04:09] <IceMichael> yeah, this upgrade is insane
[11:04:23] <IceMichael> full UT-coverage could help to even be sure that function works after tons of manual work
[11:04:52] <schinckel> Even having something that imports every file can help - at least that can catch syntax changes.
[11:05:30] <schinckel> But I feel your pain - we did it after the 2.x cutoff, but not as late as this...even back then we were running into issues with libraries not working...
[11:06:40] <serafeim> and in addition to this, the server is centos 6.10. so no support also.
[11:07:01] <serafeim> and also runs mysql 5.1 or something (like 10 years old). so
[11:07:52] <mbrndtgn> serafeim: protip (although i haven't tried it): you can setup a local proxy which wraps your http requests via your old pip into modern https
[11:08:08] <serafeim> for my latest apps i am trying to keep them always upgraded (i.e when i change something i also upgrade the django and friends version)

[11:09:05] <mbrndtgn> i don't know of any specific tutorial, but any proxy with modern https support should work

[13:01:29] <TuringSystem> (Sorry for the delay) I humble come here, to get your precious advice about Django (3.1) models Meta.default_permissions. As I followed the documentation (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/auth/default/#default-permissions) I understand that define a Meta.default_permissions in a model allow all users to have previously mentioned
[13:01:29] <TuringSystem> permissions (check with user.has_perm), but it's not the case. May some of you have experience about this particular point.
[13:04:16] *** Joins: stabler (~stabler@0x3ec7b3b0.osd.customer.dk.telia.net)
[13:07:24] <jor> TuringSystem: it only creates (or 'registers') the permissions for the model. It does not _give_ permissions to users, have to do that yourself
[13:10:06] <TuringSystem> https://dpaste.org/tzwC <- So this will only create 7 permissions without assign it to users ? What's the difference between `default_permissions` and `permissions`, aside to be able to set permissions label ?
[13:10:31] *** Joins: Rikem (~mike@user/rikem)
[13:11:31] *** Joins: znpy (~znpy@user/znpy)
[13:14:52] <jor> TuringSystem: 'permission' are extra, so they get _added_ to the defaults_permissions list
[13:15:26] <jor> TuringSystem: in other words, usually use permissions. Only use default_permissions if you really really don't have the default list
[13:16:41] <jor> TuringSystem: and yes, no permissions are assigned to users. This is all just declaratively specifying which permissions will be available to be used
[13:18:56] <jor> assigning permissions is often done interactively, in some admin application. But sometimes you assign perms when the user instance is created
[13:19:11] <TuringSystem> Got it, thanks (y) . What's the best practice to add permissions to users ? As If I made a migrations to set current permissions to all users, then change/delete permissions in this model, the previous migration won't work anymore
[13:20:34] <jor> TuringSystem: like I said, assign them on creation, where you usually know the 'role' and can give permissions. Have a (data)migration for the legacy users
[13:21:59] <TuringSystem> Thanks you very much, then I will do it this way.
[13:22:27] <jor> specifics really depends on the app, and how/when and who creates the users
[13:23:19] <jor> e.g. a self sign-up like process, usually has a activation/verification process. So you'd hook into that to only give permissions after that is done
[13:24:49] <jor> though personally, I pretty much always go through a Group to give permissions. Bit more flexible when you need to add/remove perms later on
[13:26:22] <TuringSystem> In my case it's a LDAP authentication, but I guess I can hook after that we copy basic information from LDAP to Django user table to assign a `__default__` group that I update
[13:30:05] <jor> well, with LDAP, the groups are usually kept/defined there. So usually just mirror those to django auth Groups

[13:55:18] <serafeim> diverdude: not in the near future
[13:59:27] <TuringSystem> Do you need to make long usage of the ORM ?
[14:01:25] <TuringSystem> Personally I use Celery for long async tasks. Quite simple to setup
[14:06:29] <FunkyBob> not the same 'async' concept, TuringSystem
[14:06:36] <jor> TuringSystem: reason to use async in Django is usually to push updates to clients (e.g. websocket), so background tasks is not an option
[14:07:01] *** Joins: doev (~doev@p549d77d0.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[14:07:03] <FunkyBob> this is asyncio based async, not 'background task queue' async

[20:18:38] <GinFuyou> When you .save() the object itself, yes

[20:20:15] <GinFuyou> You first save Question, then attach choices. Either saving (creating), or updating nullable relation
[20:21:59] <Steve-Dusty> do I have to commit question?
[20:22:10] <GinFuyou> Yes
[20:22:18] <Steve-Dusty> I don't want it to appear on the page until

[20:22:39] <Steve-Dusty> they attach choices
[20:22:49] <GinFuyou> So do it in one step?
[20:22:53] <Steve-Dusty> because what if they just typed the question
[20:23:03] <Steve-Dusty> and then left
[20:23:09] <Steve-Dusty> and the question would appear on the homepage
[20:23:14] <Steve-Dusty> with no choices
[20:23:27] <GinFuyou> Don't allow questions with no choices
[20:24:01] <GinFuyou> Or don't display them
[20:24:14] <GinFuyou> Whatever you like better for your workflow
[20:24:44] <Steve-Dusty> but that's the other way around. I'd need to check in the Choices model to see if there's any choice corresponding with the Question inputted?
[20:24:58] <Steve-Dusty> not if the Question have any choices imperatively
[20:25:22] <Steve-Dusty> because Question have no Choice field. But Choice have foreignkey Question field

[21:26:52] <bmbouter[m]> we use the ORM in coroutines, yes I know this is potentially unsafe, but we don't exchange ORM state between them, we just run the query in the coroutine and that's it
[21:27:59] <bmbouter[m]> does anyone have insight into why django's ensure_connection is making a new connection with every coroutine?
[21:28:37] <bmbouter[m]> over the lifetime of our workload (minutes) we could create tens of thousands of coroutines...
[21:28:38] <CodenameTim> The channels docs explains this problem and suggests using `channels.db.database_sync_to_async`. While it's not standard django, I believe it's been moving towards that.

[23:15:26] <derf-> Hi everyone.  I'm working with a django 2.2.17 application that I didn't write - flagsmith - and I'm trying to manage user accounts on it. specifically, I'd like to delete a user.  I used to manage a django 1.x application (openedx) and I remember previously being able to tweak users in the shell.   However, I'm getting this error that I really
[23:15:26] <derf-> don't know how to interpret:  `AttributeError: Manager isn't available; 'auth.User' has been swapped for 'users.FFAdminUser'`  https://pastebin.com/GZGHkP67
[23:18:24] <CodenameTim> Hi derf-, it looks like the user model has been switched out with a custom implementation. Use `django.contrib.auth.get_user_model()` to get a reference to the actual user model (user.FFAdminUser). The docs on the subject are here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/auth/customizing/#referencing-the-user-model
[23:18:40] <CodenameTim> users.FFAdminUser*

[23:45:37] <derf-> although I don't really know how to select or modify a user, now that I have the model imported :-/
[23:46:28] <CodenameTim> It should be the same way you would have with `auth.User`. `FFAdminUser.objects.all()`, etc
[23:47:32] <derf-> ah, right, I forgot the `.ojbects` 🤦
