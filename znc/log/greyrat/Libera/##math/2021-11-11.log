[00:11:47] <fltrz> both for myself, and for the community

[00:19:23] <mycroftiv> fltrz: you have to be very careful in how you state things like that because of issues like unique representation and if your equivalence is actually a quotient with technically distinct elements or something
[00:19:58] <greenbagels> yes that is probably the main concern about using decimal (or any base) representations to prove things about reals

[01:24:33] <[itchyjunk]> sure they do, i take n,m in N and construct n/m's
[01:24:37] <[itchyjunk]> i get both 1/2 and 2/4
[01:24:48] <PlanckWalk> You mean ordered pairs (1,2) and (2,4)?
[01:24:52] <PlanckWalk> They're not elements of Q
[01:24:59] <mornfall> [itchyjunk]: a rational number is not a pair of natural numbers
[01:25:02] <[itchyjunk]> why is 1/2  = 2/4 without the relationship a/b = c/d if ad = bc ?
[01:25:17] <PlanckWalk> You're talking about N^2 and calling it Q
[01:25:20] <mycroftiv> the number 1/2 in the formal set corresponding to Q is going to look like {{1,2},{2,4},{3,6}...} - the elements of Q are the infinite sets of equivalence classes
[01:25:21] <PlanckWalk> N^2 is not Q
[01:25:24] <mornfall> [itchyjunk]: (1, 2) ≠ (2, 4)
[01:25:36] <PlanckWalk> Or Z^2 or whatever else
[01:26:02] <PlanckWalk> Or even Z x N\{0}
[01:26:11] <PlanckWalk> None of those are Q
[01:26:15] <mornfall> mycroftiv: the elements of ℚ, _in that construction_ are equivalence classes, not sets of them
[01:26:44] <PlanckWalk> There are lots of different ways to model Q, but none of them have 1/2 distinct from 2/4
[01:27:29] <mycroftiv> mornfall: i think i agree completely although why is it wrong to talk about a set that collects those equivalence classes?
[01:27:59] <mycroftiv> and yes Q is 'whatever acts like Q' via the axiomatization of what we want Q to be, a given formal construction is fine if it has the behaviors
[01:28:08] <[itchyjunk]> sure they can,  you're using a def of rational numebrs that says (a,b) ~ (c,d) <=> ad = bc
[01:28:09] <[itchyjunk]> i am not
[01:28:11] <mornfall> mycroftiv: you said ‘elements of ℚ are sets of equivalence classes’ while what you probably meant was ‘elements of ℚ are equivalence classes’
[01:28:23] <PlanckWalk> [itchyjunk]: Then you're not talking about Q.
[01:28:26] <mornfall> [itchyjunk]: well, we all agree what ℚ is, except you
[01:28:40] <PlanckWalk> Use a different term for ... whatever thing you're talking about.
[01:28:44] <mycroftiv> i work in agda constructive MLTT so its types rather than sets, Q constructed as a type made from integers via a typing relation
[01:28:44] <[itchyjunk]> im not talking about the Q you're talking about that assumes that relationship
[01:28:56] <PlanckWalk> [itchyjunk]: Then use a different symbol for it.
[01:29:05] <[itchyjunk]> No
[01:29:06] <PlanckWalk> We're using the *standard* symbol.
[01:29:19] <[itchyjunk]> i didn't say \mathbb{Q} the one you're using with that relationship

[01:52:04] <isekaijin> Since Agda is not based on set theory and uses its own weird foundations, would it be legitimate to call it “an alternative to mathematics”, perhaps “para-mathematics”?
[01:52:19] <[itchyjunk]> i don't understand coprimeness
[01:52:29] <[itchyjunk]> what do you mean you can't even make 2/4?
[01:52:52] <[itchyjunk]> is agda based on type theory? alternate foundation to set theory right?
[01:52:59] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: id say its just another way to express mathematics, we think of 'the natural numbers' as a mathematical object and we can use many foundations to talk about them
[01:53:47] <greenbagels> is there a formal definition of class in the context of zfc
[01:53:59] <isekaijin> Perhaps we could say that Agda is powerful enough to provide a useful alternative to mathematics, at least in theory. Since it can express something that behaves very much like the natural numbers do in normal mathematics.
[01:54:07] <greenbagels> this analysis book seems so odd; they keep using terms very deliberately but not actually being clear about how significant they are to care about
[01:54:38] <mycroftiv> itchyjunk: in those agda definitions you cant pair up arbitrary integers to make rationals, you have to prove its in reduced form first, its just another way to code up how Q is supposed to behave
[01:54:42] <greenbagels> for example, they talk about the class of ordinals, which makes me think "well some of those people in ##math have mentioned classes are not sets; why not mention this distinction"
[01:54:55] <[itchyjunk]> mycroftiv, oh i see
[01:55:00] <somiaj> I think a class is outside of ZFC, category theory might be the formal theory behind them though.
[01:55:20] <mycroftiv> greenbagels: the set class distinction is formally understood yes, ordinals are a class but not a set
[01:55:22] <somiaj> but I don't see why an anaylsis book would need a formal definition of a class.
[01:55:31] <isekaijin> mycroftiv: No, in normal mathematics you can very much talk about the rational number 2/4, and it just happens to be the same as the rational number 1/2.

[01:58:51] <somiaj> but I think it is okay just to think of a class as a collection of objects that is too big to be a set
[01:58:56] <mycroftiv> category theory gets into classes because it again grabs collections 'too large' to be a set, i think the class of all topological spaces is a standard example
[01:59:05] <somiaj> it also means you can't think of it like a set (unions/intersections/and so on)
[01:59:33] <mycroftiv> but you can then use grothendieck universes (like inaccessible cardinals) to re-set-ify as 'large' is how they do it, i think
[01:59:38] <isekaijin> I don't know what the “proper category theorist” attitude toward size issues is, but in Ravi's algebraic geometry notes, he begins saying that he is not going to worry about size issues in category theory.
[01:59:44] <isekaijin> Is this attitude prevalent among category theorists?
[01:59:59] <mycroftiv> because there are quite safe axioms to use to let you work without worrying about it

[02:07:44] <mycroftiv> especially because there is a lot of self-embedding and 'we can find any finite amopunt of information in the arbitrary infinite extension' which is quite like rasiowa-sikorski lemma in forcing

[03:11:30] <mycroftiv> by the way, after watching the video lectures, id say its good that a new book on the disc embedding theorem is out, because both Freedman and Edwards (the two original authorities) got tangled explaining the Design portion of the proof in 2013
[03:12:33] <mycroftiv> no offense to the brilliance or most-likely correctness of the work, but moments like 'I drew a picture of this in the original paper, i looked at it last night, it didnt help much now' about various details of infintie donuts inside donuts were not quite rigorous

[03:14:47] <mycroftiv> it varies a lot, i think since i mostly study set theory and type theory and do computer formalization, im mostly in the more rigorous end of the pool, and this theorem is indeed notoriously hard

[03:16:30] <johnkeats6> i looked at the book yesterday, for like 5 minutes. it looks cool. but looks like ordinary style of topology and geometry. still light years away from anything you could comfortably type into coq or whatever
[03:16:32] <VzxPLnHqr> I understand that there is such a thing as a permutation group (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_group), but I would like to know if there is such a thing as a "Permutation Semiring"?
[03:18:14] <VzxPLnHqr> in other words, the permutation group is trivially a monoid on the set of permutations, but are there other monoids on this same set?
[03:18:40] <VzxPLnHqr> and if so, do any two of them behave such that they form a semiring?
[03:18:51] <johnkeats6> i'd think of a group ring rather than a ring structure on the set of permutations itself

[03:22:00] <VzxPLnHqr> johnkeats6, thanks, and sorry my abstract algebra and group theory is a bit shakey at best. So are you saying if G is the set of permutations of the set M = {1,2,3,4} (this is from the wikipedia article), that there might be more than one monoid over G?,
[03:22:04] <mycroftiv> johnkeats6: not well, in my opinion, yet. honestly constructive mathematical foundations still have issues with the standard reals id say, although some would dispute
[03:22:12] <LTCD> Hey, could someone explain how this because it does not appear to be on the correct line?

[03:24:34] <johnkeats6> idk how to encode them, i'm just asking how well can you do intricate old-timey topological arguments involving lots of tricky homeomorphisms and bing stuff and what not
[03:24:52] <mycroftiv> jeslie0: i think thats a reasonable interpretation of what would be necessary, yes
[03:25:07] <mycroftiv> (to go the traditional route, that is)
[03:25:17] <johnkeats6> i know nothing about hott but i figured it was built to handle synthetic homotopy stuff which is the antithesis of the old-timey topology
[03:26:11] <johnkeats6> what things? i know of no relation between QC and hott or manifold topology
[03:26:16] <VzxPLnHqr> Z-module, right but the new operation (call it `plus`) would also need to behave with the composition of permutations operation (call it `times`) such that the two follow the semiring laws. This does not seem very easy to me.

It shouldn't be that hard to define the category of topological spaces (0-types with certain monics representing open subsets), but actually constructing examples might end up being difficult. For instance, I think there is a lot of machinery that goes into constructing the real numbers. I'm not sure how easy it would be to use that type if you don't

[03:31:40] <Z-module> VzxPLnHqr: If your new monoid composition isn't somehow "respecting" permutations in some way, you're free to define all kinds of other monoids on those sets, there's a whole lot of them.
[03:33:01] <dude12312414> my bet is that quantum computing won't ever get to do RSA factorizations
[03:33:21] <VzxPLnHqr> Z-module, hmm, I am not sure I am following you. For simplicity, let's say the underlying set is a deck of cards (or, if you prefer, number 0..51). I am confused how the new operation would not respect the permutation?
[03:33:24] <mycroftiv> jeslie0: yes, cubical agda right now has nice HITs with computational meaning but no attempt to define real numbers in its library
[03:33:26] <johnkeats6> jeslie0, right, i imagine. i think it's similar to that truism about the language you speak influencing the thoughts you form. the foundations you choose influence the mathematics you end up doing
[03:34:03] <johnkeats6> dude12312414, well, yeah, that too. the bubble will burst in like 10 years when nothing useful has happened and all the venture capitalists move to a new hype
[03:35:55] <Z-module> VzxPLnHqr: for example, say you use S_3 = the group of all permutations of {1,2,3}, a nonabelian group (thus also a monoid). If we rename the things in S_3, in some order, as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5   and we now make a new '+' operation on this set by using addition mod 6 on those numbers there, that's a new monoid (in fact group) operation on the set, that is not isomorphic to the original. But this new operation really has nothing to do with
[03:35:56] <Z-module> the actual permutations on {1,2,3}.

[05:56:46] <mycroftiv> the ultrapower to model construction used in Scott's proof that the existence of a measurable cardinal contradicts V = L requires this trick to handle class/set issues
[05:59:19] <greenbagels> yeah i asked because this text introduced a theorem that the class of ordinal numbers is well-ordered
[05:59:46] <greenbagels> and the proof relies on showing that any set of ordinal numbers has a least element
[05:59:58] <greenbagels> but it made me wonder if that could be insufficient to show the same for some sub-class? i dont know
[06:01:54] <greenbagels> but now the link you sent made me realize something else; the book never really defined cardinal numbers
[06:02:13] <mycroftiv> mm, doesnt transfinite induction in ZF and general aspects of well-foundedness and ordering probably prove all that without scott's trick? im handwaving here but i think you dont need anything too fancy to get your ordinals ordered
[06:02:39] <isekaijin> Consider the series S = \sum_n a_n, where n ranges over the naturals as usual. The Raabe convergence for whether S converges, as I know it, is to check the limit of [n (a_n - a_{n+1}) / a_{n+1}].
[06:03:51] <isekaijin> Is there a variant of this test that involves instead checking the limit of [n (a_n - a_{n+1}) / a_n]?

[06:10:52] <greenbagels> i think its just meant for me to take the existence of this concept of "class" for granted and pretend it works like sets in some way
[06:12:07] <mycroftiv> until and unless it says something that makes no sense, that sounds very appropriate. the fact that ordinals and ordering relations are almost tautologically inter-defined in set foundations shouldnt involve any heavy machinery

[06:14:37] <mycroftiv> by the way if you ever need to make sure your use of a set-quantification isnt accidentally a class, quantify over everything up to some V_k of the cumulative hierarchy where k is any decently sized cardinal to make what is below a model, thats what all the categorical issues boil down to also
[06:16:29] <greenbagels> i will likely have to read about what thie cumulative hierarchy thing means first
[06:16:49] <greenbagels> (i've never stepped foot in category theory or set theory land beyond using exact sequences and commutative diagrams in algebra)
[06:17:01] <mycroftiv> iterating the powerset operation along ordinals, starting with the finite and going through all the infinities, its the whole universe of math according to ZF foundations
[06:17:35] <mycroftiv> start with the empty set, start taking powersets, take the unions at limits, repeat ad trans-infinitum.

[06:18:46] <mycroftiv> to a platonic oriented set theorist, all questions of math are about what sets you can find when you look inside the 'V' generated by this process
[06:19:32] <mycroftiv> a category theorist would say 'not really, but Yoneda lemma means we can use sets to understand the pointwise representation of whatever we are interested in'
[06:20:24] <mycroftiv> and even a constructive type theorist will find that the universe of constructive MLTT is a subportion of this cumulative hierarchy via translation such as Aczel's constructive zermelo frankel

[06:44:51] <Batzy> where that was my estimate, but I want to compare it to say, BLAS

[06:46:28] <Batzy> with something I actually write, I can literally count each floating point op, but I have no idea how to measure it if im just calling BLAS

[09:05:31] <solrize> https://www.math.ttu.edu/~cmonico/software/ggnfs/
[09:05:34] <solrize> looking
[09:05:35] <PlanckWalk> I think this is the one I heard of, but haven't tried it  https://www.math.ttu.edu/~cmonico/software/ggnfs/
[09:05:39] <PlanckWalk> Haha yes
[09:05:42] <solrize> aha
[09:06:06] <solrize> i implemented pollard rho method a while back but i think that won't really reach 100 digits
[09:06:46] <PlanckWalk> Heh GGNFS is 16 years old
[09:06:54] <solrize> " It is not a black box for factoring integers - you need to know a few things about how the NFS works to use it. Having said that: "   yeah that's about what i expected lol.  but it says there is a perl wrapper that can go up to 120 digits or so.
[09:07:07] <solrize> i dunno of any advances since then
[09:09:06] <solrize> i bet there are other implementations around but gnfs uses i have heard of involved manually organizing the different phases

[14:26:25] <CalimeroTeknik> to which it seems the same model applies; if an argument isn't very strong, the perceived strength of the argumentation overall will be the average (not the sum) of the strength of its arguments

[14:57:33] <CalimeroTeknik> the nonlinearity you mentioned is actually relevant here; for 1 event, it might be better to model the possibilities as a vector field (? not sure of terminology) where things such as attractors (sinks) and repulsors (sources) can appear
[15:00:10] <PlanckWalk> You might need to define the model more tightly.  E.g. instead of trying to model how people will actually rate arguments, you may need to settle for how some simplified model of a person would do so.
[15:00:19] <CalimeroTeknik> there's a correspondence to the pilot wave interpretation of QM here, to define it more tightly
[15:00:38] <CalimeroTeknik> ah, sorry, that was about probability in general
[15:01:30] <CalimeroTeknik> concerning how people will rate arguments, I will not attempt to model it more precisely, only to play tricks on what appears to be a statistical bias within the reactions

[19:53:23] <Guest59> for sum_n=0^inf 3^(n-1)/4^n,  this looks close to a geometric series form. I write (1/4)(3/4)^(n-1), but doesn't the power have to be n instead of n-1 ?

[20:47:51] <Z-module> cadmio: that's right.  As I've said quite a few times now, if B is any subgroup of G, the collection of all left cosets of B partitions G into sets each of size |B|, so |G| = |B|*(the # of all left cosets of B).  So  |G|/|B| = the integer (# of all left cosets of B), denoted |G:B|. This is precisely |G/B| when B is normal since G/B, as a set, *is* the collection of all the cosets of B.

[20:50:00] <Z-module> the *number*  |G:B|  doesn't need B to be normal, since the # of distinct left cosets of B always = the # of right cosets, regardless. And this number is always |G|/|B| if G is finite, by the argument I indicated.
[20:50:39] <Z-module> and then this number is also |G/B| in the case of B being normal so that G/B is actually a group.
[20:52:16] <Z-module> my |G:H| is your (G:H).  You also find the notation [G:H] for this, fairly commonly.

[21:24:44] <Guest59> for sum_(n=0)^inf n/e^(n^2), I want to do integral test, but how do i even integrate this? int_0^inf n/e^(n^2). If I let u = n^2, then du = 2ndn. Like that? Cause then we have 1/e^u

[21:30:33] <Guest59> I haven't. But for a different question: for sum_(n=0)^(inf) (4+3^n)/2^n, how do we do this again?
[21:30:59] <tolarz> split: 4/2^n + (3/2)^n
[21:31:39] <tolarz> does this even converge?
[21:31:41] <tolarz> hmhm
[21:31:41] <Guest59> okay.but now that first series... that diverges
[21:31:56] <tolarz> it diverges anyhow i guess
[21:32:08] <tolarz> since (4+3^n)/2^n -/-> 0
[21:32:35] <tolarz> (4+3^n)/2^n >= 3^n/2^n = (3/2)^n >= 1
[21:32:42] <tolarz> thus it surely does not converge to ß

[23:11:15] <Guest5912> what is a "Grothendieck" prime?
[23:12:23] <int-e> It's 57.
[23:12:25] <Franciman> that's a number grothendieck thought was prime
[23:12:28] <Franciman> but it is not
[23:13:10] <Franciman> 57/3 = 29
[23:13:26] <Franciman> err
[23:13:29] <Franciman> 19
[23:13:31] <Franciman> lol
[23:13:32] <Guest5912> the guy got a number named after himself for screwing up?

[23:15:25] <Guest5912> ah
[23:15:48] <Guest5912> well, i guess it only matters that they were really smart and made a silly error. Whereas I'm just really not smart and make silly errors
[23:15:48] <int-e> It's widely shared because Grothendieck was (and is) quite famous, mostly for abstract results. So slipping up with a concrete computation fits that image.

[23:22:46] <ysftaha> How do I prove this?
[23:22:46] <ysftaha> http://mathb.in/67398
[23:24:14] <tolarz> ysftaha:just unfold definitions
[23:25:41] <ysftaha> like this:
[23:25:41] <ysftaha> (∀ x ∈ X)(x,x) ∈ R ↔ {(a,b) ∈ X * X | a = b} ∈ R
[23:25:49] <ysftaha> where * is the cartesian prod

[23:26:04] <tolarz> it should be subseteq on the right
[23:26:06] <tolarz> but yeah
[23:26:11] <ysftaha> oh mb
[23:26:18] <ysftaha> (∀ x ∈ X)(x,x) ∈ R ↔ {(a,b) ∈ X * X | a = b} ⊆ R
[23:26:50] <ysftaha> ok. But then what? I just have no idea how to get from reflexivity to some statement about some subset.
[23:27:45] <Z-module> A relation R is reflexive iff (x,x) is in it for every x in the set, and it doesn't care at all which other pairs (x,y)  might be in it, for this purpose.
[23:27:56] <tolarz> look up how you prove ⊆
[23:28:01] <tolarz> e.g., for ->
[23:28:09] <tolarz> first perform -> introduction,
[23:28:18] <tolarz> then let (a,b) ∈ X*X (for the proof of subset)
[23:28:21] <tolarz> such that a = b
[23:28:28] <tolarz> we need to show (a,b) ∈ R
[23:28:35] <tolarz> by a=b it's equivalent to showing (a,a) ∈ R
[23:28:47] <tolarz> by assumption of LHS of <-> initially made, this is trivial

[23:30:03] <Z-module> one reason is direct products vs free products in groups
[23:30:22] <Z-module> another is that in actual math typesetting, the symbol used is never an asterisk/star
[23:31:00] <ysftaha> I usually use \times but it looks like an x here. But I get your point. Will do next time.

[23:33:32] <qergle> the problem arose because your × was actually an "x" and you used it to denote multiplication of naturals and used variables names "x" and "y", iirc
[23:33:58] <qergle> so you wrote xxy=1 or xxy=p
[23:34:22] <ysftaha> thanks! I'll use  × from now on
[23:34:39] <qergle> if your sets are caps then lowercase "x" rather than ×, will do fine.

[23:46:48] <riv> why is axiom of choice needed to pick an element from an infinite product of nonempty sets?
[23:47:34] <buster> it isn't always
[23:47:54] <riv> yes I have seen that there are some special cases
[23:47:59] <riv> but why it is needed in the general case?
[23:48:35] <dude12312414> countable choice may be sufficient
[23:48:51] <johnkeats7> the axiom of choice says the product is non-empty. you cannot pick an element if it's empty
[23:49:38] <buster> if you can prove from the other axioms that the product is non-empty, you don't need the axiom of choice
[23:50:02] <buster> if you can't, then either (a) you need another axiom or (b) you can't prove it
[23:50:38] <buster> make sense riv?
[23:51:05] <ysftaha> tolarz: wait so, e ∈ {(a,b) ∈ X × X | a = b} → e ∈ R
[23:51:16] <ysftaha> R is just some relation

[23:51:42] <riv> can we rigorously prove that it is needed
[23:51:58] <johnkeats7> yes
[23:52:30] <ysftaha> right? So just because all relations are Dom(R) × Ran(R) then equality is a relation?
[23:52:50] <johnkeats7> riv, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice#Independence
[23:53:18] <riv> I don't think that answers my question

[23:53:27] <johnkeats7> yes it does
[23:54:54] <Z-module> ysftaha: a relation R does not have to be that full set.
[23:55:49] <riv> I don't think it does
[23:56:34] <Z-module> ysftaha: a general relation on a set X simply some subset of X × X -- could be {}, could be all of X × X, could be anything in between.
[23:56:54] <ysftaha> oh right.
[23:58:04] <ysftaha> wait so when tolarz said let (a,b) ∈ X × X he meant introduce such a set?
[23:58:51] <ysftaha> Sorry, first time doing a proof of this form
