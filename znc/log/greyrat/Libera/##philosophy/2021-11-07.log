[02:57:07] <causative> good is truth, or the actions the truth motivates
[02:58:01] <mannequin> one of the books says the world is good
[02:58:23] <causative> what is done in ignorance may be good or bad - but it is misguided. What is done with full knowledge and awareness is at least what the individual who acts judges to be good.
[02:59:43] <mannequin> do you ever feel bad when you do something bad?
[02:59:49] <causative> others may judge it is not good.  If two people disagree on what is good, usually this disagreement will come down to some difference of opinion or perspective about material facts - or a disagreement on the facts themselves. And resolving the disagreement about the facts will make them agree.
[03:00:07] <causative> yes of course
[03:00:16] <mannequin> conscience
[03:01:55] <causative> It is at least conceivable that two people may disagree on what is good while *agreeing* on all relevant material facts, such as the existence of God or who committed what crimes. In almost all practical cases, a difference in opinion on what is good results from a difference in opinion on what is factual, but it is *conceivable* that there are cases where this is not so.
[03:02:38] <causative> In these unusual cases, the individual must judge what is good for himself - the opinion of the other, who fundamentally disagrees without disagreeing on the facts, cannot help him here
[03:02:44] <mannequin> this is making me autodestructive
[03:03:21] <causative> so ultimately, what "is good" is subordinate to what the individual - you - *says* is good, or *would* say is good if they were fully informed
[03:03:27] <mannequin> we're trying to understand something bigger than our forms can take
[03:03:54] <causative> from my perspective, what "is good" is what I would be persuaded to *say* is good, if I knew all the relevant facts
[03:04:15] <causative> and from your perspective, what "is good" is what you would be persuaded to say is good, if you knew all the relevant facts
[03:04:32] <causative> and perhaps these two things are the same - perhaps we would agree with each other if we agreed on the facts.  Or perhaps we would not.

[03:17:31] <Delf> I must be lacky in excessive amounts in order to prefer what is easy when it comes to such critical things
[03:18:29] <causative> if you are an aware and rational person, you *can't* believe in religious dogmas, because you will know you are only fooling yourself
[03:18:45] <causative> you can at most claim to believe - but it won't be true
[03:19:05] <mannequin> "i want to believe"
[03:19:22] <causative> but if you're rational you know that merely *wanting* to believe something, doesn't make it true

[06:10:53] <thunder> it's just a set of rules, which can vary depending on the type and object of the game. kind of like poker. the exact form of martial arts involved is up to the participants depending on how appropriate it is in the context of the game.

[06:11:59] <tomathy> i like poker
[06:12:22] <thunder> it came out of my thinking about how to learn/teach self-defence in the absence a fixed master/student hierarchy, and in such a way that the practice itself embodies the understanding of restraining the use of force

[23:23:16] <Delf> Those sound like things that love can do rather than what it consists of
[23:26:17] <causative> panpsychism is really the simpler hypothesis; it is monism.  We know there is a "subjective experience" substance, from direct experience, so we must have at least that one.  Why do we need to propose another, non-mind substance? We can simply suppose that all the laws of physics are laws of the mind-substance.
[23:27:38] <causative> subatomic particles do what they do, because they subjectively want to - and what they subjectively want follows very precise mathematical laws
[23:29:04] <causative> what a human subjectively wants also follows very precise mathematical laws, though vastly more complex
[23:34:06] <Delf> Now you got to explain "want"

[23:36:14] <causative> belief + desire results in an action
[23:36:30] <causative> by observing the actions of an entity, we can reverse-engineer beliefs and desires that could result in that action
[23:37:23] <Ungwelian> Mathematics is a poor science to explain any sort of behaviour.
[23:37:56] <causative> what cannot be explained mathematically is not falsifiable
[23:38:05] <gb73d> behaviour is exhibited by animals
[23:38:20] <causative> if you can't speak precisely, then your words could be subjectively and fuzzily construed to mean all sorts of things
[23:38:21] <gb73d> they can be studied using statistics
[23:38:29] <causative> mathematics is the only way to speak completely precisely
[23:38:42] <mannequin> math can do something, living organisms are basically machines built on molecular level
[23:38:43] <Ungwelian> Not every science has to be "hard".
[23:38:53] <Ungwelian> Sc. soft sciences are just as important.
[23:39:09] <causative> to the extent a science is not "hard," it is not subject to falsification, and therefore it is less legitimate as a science
[23:39:16] <gb73d> mathematics is limited in its capacity cf Godels Theorem
[23:39:26] <causative> social sciences become harder and more mathematized over time
[23:39:47] <Ungwelian> I could just as well say, that mathematics is really not legitimate as a humanistic science.

[23:40:31] <gb73d> science deals with relative truth, philosophy attempts absolute truth
[23:40:43] <Ungwelian> It's also kinda assholish to say that soft sciences are less legitimate.
[23:40:47] <causative> if you say something precisely and unambiguously it is like you have stuck your head up and challenged anyone to strike you if they can - you cannot back out or reinterpret your words to mean something else afterwards
[23:41:15] <gb73d> yes there is always 2 sides to every story
[23:41:18] <causative> if you speak with soft and subjective language, you are not sticking your head up, you are not presenting a valid challenge, you are always leaving the possibility to retreat and say "oh no but I didn't really mean THAT"

[23:42:40] <causative> it's like challenging someone to a boxing match and then if you see yourself losing you change the rules so you "win" - it's not a legitimate challenge
[23:42:44] <fructose> causative: Social sciences frequently include antipositivism and seemingly more frequently lately, so I don't see how you can say it's become harder over time
[23:42:59] <causative> the level of mathematical sophistication in social sciences is increasing over time
[23:43:02] <Delf> That's evolution
[23:43:05] <causative> including more and more advanced statistics
[23:43:09] <fructose> causative: Based on what empirical evidence?
[23:43:49] <Ungwelian> Words, also, don't have to have strictly locked meanings.
[23:43:50] <Delf> You like math because it's accurate and you're good at it. I suck shit at it but I like accuracy.
[23:43:51] <causative> well, the evidence I have is not strong, just based on a few papers I have read in the past - and based on social scientists who have complained about this trend towards mathematization
[23:44:27] <Ungwelian> Part of humanity is understanding how other people use words.
[23:44:31] <causative> they complain that it can be used to obfuscate things and give the appearance of rigor without the actuality - which is true if the math is used wrong and misunderstood
[23:44:45] <Delf> Ungwelian: Being pragmatical?
[23:44:53] <Ungwelian> Hm?
[23:44:57] <fructose> causative: So bullshit, got it
[23:45:33] <Delf> Never mind. I thought you meant trying to understand what people mean by the words they use rather than how they use the words. Maybe it's all the same

[23:46:12] <causative> in reference to "
[23:46:12] <causative> <Ungwelian> It's also kinda assholish to say that soft sciences are less legitimate."
[23:46:57] <Ungwelian> You're painting that as a mere tribal power play.
[23:47:14] <causative> if it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck...
[23:48:00] <Ungwelian> So if someone calls you out, it means that the callout doesn't have any substance, but rather is a petty, tribalistic response?
[23:48:15] <causative> if the "callout" is a personal attack, yes
[23:48:45] <causative> use your reason
[23:48:52] <Ungwelian> You started by saying "to the extent a science is not "hard," it is not subject to falsification, and therefore it is less legitimate as a science"
[23:48:56] <causative> even if I was an asshole, pointing this out would have no bearing on whether I am right
[23:49:22] <causative> calling me an asshole is an attempt to lower my status, because of a fallacious association between low status and being wrong
[23:49:39] <Ungwelian> Maybe you should consider what was assholish about that sentence.
[23:49:59] <causative> I frankly do not care what you think was or was not assholish; I care about what is true or false
[23:50:15] <Ungwelian> But you don't care enough to second-guess yourself.
[23:50:18] <causative> status markers like "asshole" have no rational bearing on truth or falsehood
[23:50:21] <Ungwelian> Even when called out.
[23:50:48] <causative> well, it was an insult devoid of any rational content, so why should it cause me to second guess myself?
[23:50:50] <I_Am_M00t> ♥ plz everyone ♥
[23:51:25] <causative> if you had presented a valid argument why I am wrong, then I might second-guess myself
[23:51:57] <Ungwelian> Refuting bullshit takes orders of magnitude of more effort than putting it out.
[23:52:07] <Ungwelian> And like said, I slept 5h last night.
[23:52:21] <Ungwelian> Google the arguments pro and contra, if you care about truth, as you said.
[23:52:23] <causative> so let us all call names and resort to status and tribal bickering, yes?
[23:52:35] <causative> because arguing is too much effort?
[23:52:48] <Samian> Do you think it's right that it's illegal for two people to agree to fight to the death?
[23:52:48] <Ungwelian> Begin by considering why you made such a sweeping statement, which devalues many established sciences.
[23:53:07] <Samian> In the old days, people would challenge each other. Abraham Lincoln was challenged to a dual
[23:53:14] <Samian> Why are duals illegal?
[23:53:32] <causative> Ungwelian, I don't see you making any specific, rationally justified claims; the rational content of what you just said is ""
[23:54:01] <causative> Samian, what is right in the law depends on what is good for society
[23:54:32] <Samian> causative  yeah right, more like what benefits the ruler
[23:54:45] <causative> widespread dueling had a negative impact to society in that many influential people were killed over honor disputes
