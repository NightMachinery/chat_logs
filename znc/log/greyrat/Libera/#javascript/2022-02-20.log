[04:01:30] <ghostbuster> cool
[04:01:54] <Maxdamantus> It doesn't have the same access that a debugger does (eg, it can't inspect variables within functions from the origin), but I don't think greasemonkey lets you do anything like that.

[04:02:27] <Maxdamantus> in general though, you can do a lot of things with access to the DOM, which you have when using a "bookmarklet" or greasemonkey.

[04:03:21] <Maxdamantus> That is probably possible, assuming the blob URL is visible in the DOM and assuming the origin doesn't invalidate the blob URL too quickly.
[04:03:45] <gde33> ljharb: ah its in the spec, just not implemented: "5MB per app per browser. According to the HTML5 spec, this limit can be increased by the user when needed; however, only a few browsers support this"
[04:04:43] <Maxdamantus> Though even if the origin does invalidate the blob URL, you can probably work around that by wrapping around `URL.createObjectURL` and `URL.revokeObjectURL`

[07:11:34] <yolo> i'm learning js, just read: https://css-tricks.com/node-javascript-compared-to-javascript/ then realized I do not need learn those async-nodejs at least for now to speed up the progress, I can use npm and nodejs to set up the frontend, but at a language level, I want to 'focus on' those frontend related content, i.e. frontend does not care that much for promise/async/await that much but i was not aware
[07:12:01] <ljharb> prologic: lol i said it's an incompetent idea. i didn't say YOU were.
[07:12:07] <prologic> anyhoo thanks for all the ideas and help in any case guys/gals (or whatever pronoun you prefer to be called)

[07:14:55] <ljharb> KevinX: and fetch can never be compliant outside of a browser
[07:15:09] <ljharb> KevinX: so node's experimental fetch, even when it stops being experimental, will always be broken and a lie
[07:15:11] <yolo> nodejs is adding fetch now
[07:15:18] <ljharb> sadly
[07:15:26] <Rockwood> fetch means

[07:16:19] <ljharb> KevinX: correct
[07:16:25] <yolo> it has been a painful procress, i was a c progammer and js ecosystem is just crazy

[07:17:12] <ljharb> yolo: yes, you need to forget everything you know about c and learn JS
[07:17:15] <ljharb> !eloquent @ yolo
[07:17:16] <jellobot> yolo, Eloquent JavaScript is a comprehensive introductory Web-based book with examples and a built-in interpreter. http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[07:17:43] <KevinX> yolo what do you want/plan to build?
[07:18:24] <yolo> ox1eef: i'm good at using npm and set up the env(which takes a lot of time but i'm getting there), I can bear with the nodejs-for-tooling part, but I dont want to have any other thing to do with nodejs-the-backend, just js for frontend
[07:18:34] <yolo> for example in the old days you have jquery and that's it, no nodejs shit
[07:18:57] <ljharb> yolo: node is awesome
[07:19:01] <ljharb> yolo: and the more node you have, the better
[07:19:01] <yolo> KevinX: GUI for a network device that serves rest-api
[07:19:09] <ljharb> yolo: use react. and server-render it in node.
[07:19:20] <KevinX> modern front end is essentially pick a framework/library and run with that
[07:19:35] <KevinX> react is the most popular choice
[07:19:35] <yolo> server side is in C as a rest-api server, no way to run nodejs there
[07:19:46] <ox1eef> yolo: as i suggested earlier, you can create a bundle.js that exports dependencies to 'window', and use those dependencies in your regular frontend JS.
[07:20:10] <ljharb> yolo: gross, but ok, you still need to run all your tests for your frontend in node
[07:20:13] <ljharb> yolo: and your build process
[07:20:16] <KevinX> ox1eef i think you said that to someone else
[07:20:28] <ox1eef> KevinX: i did :)
[07:20:32] <ox1eef> he left though.
[07:20:42] <yolo> google failed to find me anything focus on frontend-javascript, it's all about frontend-frameworks(which I use vue)
[07:20:51] <ljharb> yolo: javascript is javascript
[07:21:13] <ljharb> yolo: and if you're using vue (altho you should consider react) then most of the browser-specific stuff will be abstracted away from you
[07:21:31] <KevinX> there are probably web assembly binging for c and i woulndt be surprised if someone created a react like c framework :P
[07:21:38] <KevinX> bindings*
[07:21:40] <ox1eef> that doesn't mean you shouldn't understand what's underneath though, don't get lost solely in a framework. those come and go. the fundamentals dont.
[07:21:56] <KevinX> Vue has an entire suite of tooling
[07:22:02] <yolo> react is another learning curve, time is limited, i know react is more popular, meanwhile it's harder to learn, html-in-js is hard then js-in-html as i'm new to js

[07:22:45] <KevinX> vue does that too though
[07:23:00] <yolo> ox1eef: which is why i'm asking js language here instead of vue3, i want to learn js, but don't have time to learn everything, so, if I can get rid of some node-js specific js features, I am more than happy to reduce some learning load
[07:23:32] <ox1eef> learning is a process that comes in stages, start with the basics and when you feel comfortable move onto abstractions built on the basics, like Vue/React.
[07:23:35] <KevinX> stick with vue until you are good at it, then try something else next

[07:27:24] <yolo> need learn js as whenever i got stuck with vue, it turns out to be some fundamental js stuff
[07:27:28] <KevinX> react is a library
[07:27:54] <ox1eef> when you put all the bits together as ppl commonly do it is more like a framework imo
[07:27:55] <KevinX> you dont even need to use JSX (although silly not to)

[07:29:39] <ljharb> SSR in JS is supremely better then everything before it
[07:30:00] <ljharb> and yes, the hopefully brief period of time where we all thought client-only rendering was acceptable will hopefully be soon over

[07:33:18] <yolo> also there is alpine.js, best replacement for jquery IMO
[07:33:26] <ljharb> react is the replacement for jquery
[07:33:51] <yolo> react is from meta, i don't even use facebook :)
[07:34:07] <KevinX> ive heard rumors that will change
[07:34:18] <ljharb> yolo: nobody calls it meta except people who work there
[07:34:21] <ljharb> yolo: and so?
[07:34:26] <ox1eef> standard browser APIS are the replacement for jquery
[07:34:39] <ox1eef> react is another thing entirely.
[07:34:51] <ljharb> true. react obviates the need for both
[07:35:04] <yolo> ox1eef: which standard APIs can learn something from jquery's elegent API naming, it does not
[07:35:21] <yolo> instead it's like java, verbose to type
[07:35:34] <ljharb> true, browser apis suck
[07:35:37] <ox1eef> learning querySelector, querySelectorAll, addEventListener - those are the common and most useful.
[07:35:41] <KevinX> to be fair, you could still use jQuery if you like that imperative approach
[07:35:53] <yolo> i spent two months trying to learn react, eventually gave up and switch to vue
[07:36:04] <KevinX> did you use class components?
[07:36:29] <KevinX> or hooks
[07:36:37] <ox1eef> KevinX: using jquery today is like carrying deadweight, unless you need to support older browser there's no need for it anymore. the problems it solved are gone.
[07:36:47] <KevinX> There are essentially two flavors of react these days
[07:37:24] <KevinX> ox1eef i havent kept up with what they are doing but I bet recent versions just give you some sensible abstractions

[07:37:47] <ox1eef> well, true, jquery continues to evolve. im speaking to the older versions.
[07:37:50] <KevinX> if you need to toggle some buttons or whatnot it's probably great
[07:38:12] <KevinX> although jquery would be overkill for a toggle :P
[07:38:33] <ox1eef> in the early days, that functionality was 'wow'.
[07:40:05] <KevinX> yeah the animation stuff too ha ha
[07:40:44] <yolo> the new kid on the block is svelte, but the naming myjs.svelte is a turning off for me, can we do myjs.vt or something

[07:41:40] <KevinX> those terms aren't related though, right?

[07:42:22] <KevinX> oh gotcha
[07:42:33] <ljharb> SPAs are almost always terrible
[07:42:45] <ox1eef> Vue is a good choice.

[07:44:44] <yolo> ljharb: why so? I don't need any SEO anyways, it's more to manage some devices, SPA offloads some server-side-rendering/templating for me

[07:45:10] <ljharb> yolo: it's got zero to do with SEO
[07:45:19] <ljharb> yolo: and you SHOULD be spending those resources
[07:45:28] <ljharb> the most expensive place to use resources is always the client
[07:45:34] <ljharb> servers are cheap, user experience is not
[07:45:59] <yolo> that does not fit for embedded devices
[07:46:17] <ljharb> maybe not. that's an insanely niche use case tho.
[07:46:23] <yolo> each cent has to be saved on the 'server' side here, while client side(desktop,cellphone) are rich
[07:46:40] <ljharb> and even then i'd say you'd be better off putting better chips in the device rather than forcing the untrustworthy and breakable clients to bear the load
[07:46:57] <ljharb> but yes, i understand the capitalist push to make cheaper and thus shittier devices
[07:47:32] <KevinX> ssg would be the best option then for that I'd imagine
[07:47:48] <yolo> a11y for such devices are normally of low priority indeed

[07:48:02] <ljharb> which is technically something you could get sued for for a large sum of money

[07:56:25] <yolo> but these days everyone should just learn typescript, much less bugs since I started using it
[07:56:39] <ljharb> lol
[07:56:51] <ljharb> typescript only prevents the kind of bugs that nobody actually runs into in practice
[07:56:54] <ljharb> just use a linter and write tests
[07:57:41] <yolo> not every one is an expert typescript helps a lot silly bugs for me at least
[07:58:09] <yolo> in fact my vim calls it out before I even run the code, 98% of the time
[07:59:17] <yolo> so i was hoping to limit the range of js I will focus on, seems there is no simple answer, back to the old way, hacking some ts|js code now
[07:59:23] <KevinX> typescript would probably be more useful to me if i were new still, thats fair
[07:59:52] <KevinX> i've made the mistakes typescript checks for so many times now it's second nature
[08:00:08] <ljharb> yolo: right but you'd catch those anyways without TS
[08:00:22] <ljharb> yolo: which means TS is adding a ton of overhead in exchange for finding bugs slightly earlier
[08:00:24] <KevinX> yolo the answer was switch to react ;-)
[08:00:43] <ljharb> yolo: but also, be aware that TS is not a superset of JS, and there's a bunch of caveats. TS also won't even protect you from type errors.

[08:21:22] <KevinX> TW has a learning curve but after a few projects you can scan classnames fluently so it's not an issue. Editor tooling makes it easy to add classes too
[08:22:14] <KevinX> The real benefit is it forces you to think more about your design system (or their default), and you dont need to maintain a god stylesheet

[08:22:47] <ox1eef> KevinX: context is key i guess, because i've built a few small static sites where a base.css was all that was needed to set the foundation.
[08:23:09] <KevinX> using a framework?
[08:23:14] <ox1eef> no framework at all.
[08:23:31] <KevinX> TW also has purge built in which makes small file sizes in production
[08:23:41] <KevinX> TW is the solution to a framework I guess
[08:23:48] <sickdyd> KevinX: I wonder how well it plays with styled components / emotion. Whenever I look at TW examples I get discouraged by the number of classes being used in a single line
[08:24:26] <KevinX> you can abstract those into component files that you never open if they bother you (they bother me too sometimes )
[08:24:26] <onosendi> KevinX: Sass fixed the 'god stylesheet' thing.
[08:24:34] <KevinX> But you gain fluency pretty fast
[08:25:13] <ljharb> sass hasn't fixed the "sass" thing tho

[08:25:36] <onosendi> ljharb: eh, that's what I meant, scss.
[08:25:49] <ox1eef> i've been trying to not use scss to see how far css has come,  it has come a long way but there's pain points still.
[08:26:18] <KevinX> tw is config file driven too, so changing a color is easy
[08:26:23] <sickdyd> personally I am super confortable with styled components and writing CSS is not a problem at all
[08:27:04] <sickdyd> I mean, at the end of the day it sounds like it's going to allow you to to pas a class called "flex flex-d-row" or something instead of wriging the css lines yourself

[08:39:50] <ox1eef> agreed, we shouldn't be ignorant but at the same time i think here on irc we discuss the problems of today, it's hard to learn what mostly seems like an idea right now.
[08:39:58] <Maxdamantus> So in general you'd probably just define common stylings in some JavaScript module, then for specific components you extend those styles, probably closer to the components that use them.
[08:39:59] <KevinX> Maxdamantus just use style={{}}

[08:40:34] <Maxdamantus> KevinX: but then you get very big `style` attributes, which is presumably where the performance issues come from.
[08:40:59] <sickdyd> const BaseButton = styled.div`{ border: 1px solid red; }`; const PrimaryButton = styled(BaseButton)`{ background-color: green; }`
[08:41:18] <KevinX> im not very familiar with performance in this area
[08:41:32] <sickdyd> then use it in your return method like <PrimaryButton>content</PrimaryButton>
[08:41:42] <Maxdamantus> My way above should basically be equivalent to using `@extend %button;` etc in SCSS, just that the CSS and the class is generated dynamically.
[08:42:31] <Maxdamantus> That styled components interface seems more limited, and it involves HoCs which are ugly.
[08:42:37] * yolo uses blockchain daily, i.e. git
[08:42:46] <sickdyd> ah, you can also use const BaseButton = styled.button`{ border: 1px solid red; }` if you want to use button as the base element
[08:42:52] <ox1eef> =]
[08:43:11] <sickdyd> Maxdamantus: why limited? you can also pass props if you need to

[08:45:50] <sickdyd> you can also use useRef to dynamically add classes from your code, if it's React
[08:45:54] <ox1eef> i see the lesson here as to not mix css into js.
[08:46:20] <sickdyd> tbh it's a breeze once you get used to it, I couldn't find serious limitations for what I've been doing so far
[08:46:22] <KevinX> i think its just what you get used to.
[08:46:33] <KevinX> the above looks like chaos to me
[08:46:48] <KevinX> but in the same way tailwind probably looks liek chaos to others
[08:46:56] <sickdyd> it's IRC, with some formatting it will make more sense
[08:47:06] <sickdyd> I also threw in TS
[08:47:14] <sickdyd> without TS it's lighter
[08:47:16] <KevinX> lets move to discord
[08:47:28] <sickdyd> nopez, I hate it

[08:47:36] <yolo> even grandpa C are doing twitter: https://twitter.com/__phantomderp/status/1494801365297676293  for C23
[08:47:56] <yolo> but i still like irc, shame on you C committe
[08:48:27] <Maxdamantus> Personally, I think the model I've described can basically be achieved fairly cleanly using SCSS. Every JS file has a corresponding SCSS file defining the classes it uses, where anything common is referred to using `@extend %pseudo-selector;`. JSX should only refer to classes defined in the corresponding SCSS file.
[08:48:30] <KevinX> twitter is probably the best place to announce something async
[08:48:47] <sickdyd> without TS it should work like this: const Button = styled.button`color: ${({ someProp }) => someProp };`
[08:49:07] <Maxdamantus> The problem is that if you have multiple people working on the styling, they'll break the pattern and it becomes difficult to track things down again.
[08:49:47] <sickdyd> what you mean with breaking the pattern?
[08:49:55] <KevinX> my issue with CSS is if you want to add a left padding, what do you choose? with TW you only have a few options so you will likely already know to use `pl-4`. But in other systems you probably have to go look it up
[08:50:13] <Maxdamantus> I mean they'll end up referring to classes defined outside of the corresponding SCSS file.
[08:50:32] <Maxdamantus> which breaks the modularity that the pattern achieves.
[08:50:33] <sickdyd> I see
[08:50:46] <KevinX> on teams, TW helps because you can't introduce new styles without editing the main config
[08:51:17] <Maxdamantus> If you do basically the same thing in JS, that modularity should be harder to break.
[08:51:20] <sickdyd> I like styled components because it allows to keep things related to the JS file, and if you don't add regular CSS classes you'll be fine
[08:51:33] <Maxdamantus> it should be relatively okay to refer to styles defined in other JS files, since you can track down those relationships more easily.
[08:51:48] <sickdyd> everything you say makes me say styled-components again :>

[08:52:50] <Maxdamantus> But it seems like styled components don't emphasise using styles as first-class things like I'm describing.
[08:52:55] <sickdyd> IIRC you can even have something like cons PrimaryButton = styled(BaseButton.withComponent("main"))`color: red;` meaning that the actual element will be a main element instead of a button element
[08:53:00] <Maxdamantus> it's instead just a more efficient way of writing `style={...}`
[08:53:40] <Maxdamantus> (but where the `style={...}` is relatively hardcoded)
[08:54:06] <KevinX> ive seen some projects organize their styled components in files they import from, which maybe helps here?
[08:54:40] <Maxdamantus> if you do use `style={...}` you can at least treat styles as first-class, because you can have `const primaryButtonStyle = { ...buttonStyle, backgroundColor: "green" }; ... <button style={primaryButtonStyle}>...</button>`
[08:55:36] <sickdyd> Maxdamantus: when you say first-class you mean a class accessible from everywhere in your project?
[08:56:13] <Maxdamantus> sickdyd: a thing accessible from everywhere, which denotes the CSS rules.
[08:56:29] <Maxdamantus> (not attached to some particular React component)
[08:56:42] <sickdyd> for that we have a folder that contains shared styled components that can be used as a base styling
[08:57:02] <sickdyd> so they are not associated with a specific JS file and can be used anywhere you need them
[08:57:11] <Maxdamantus> So you mean a base component, not a base style.
[08:57:23] <sickdyd> yes
[08:58:00] <Maxdamantus> That seems quite limiting. It seems to assume single-inheritence.
[08:58:22] <sickdyd> that base component is just a bunch of css rules that can be extended as you need
[08:58:41] <sickdyd> you initialize it as the thing that makes more sense (button for example)
[08:58:50] <sickdyd> but it really depends on what you need to do I guess

[16:47:04] <linearbit> Is there a way to guarantee the "load" event listener is called?
[16:47:33] <linearbit> Apparently it's not called in my javascript module and my best guess is that it's because the event is added after the window is already loaded

[16:51:15] <Alexendoo> linearbit: You can check https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/readyState
[16:53:43] <linearbit> Alexendoo, so should the pattern for type="module" generally be something along the lines of this? if (document.readyState === "complete") { main(); } else { window.addEventListener("load", main); }

[16:54:09] <linearbit> I guess even then it's possible there's a race condition there
[16:54:46] <Alexendoo> There's no race condition there, but note that complete/the load event includes waiting for e.g. all the images to finish loading on the page, you generally don't want that

[16:55:57] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)
[16:56:12] <linearbit> Alexendoo, in this case it's exactly what I need since main runs code that depends on the dimensions of these resources
[16:56:31] <Alexendoo> linearbit: That's fine in that case
[16:56:53] <linearbit> I guess the "load" event only worked on my other page since the image takes long enough to load
[16:57:12] <linearbit> so it's possible that the site would break if someone has fast enough internet that the content is loaded before the "load" event is attached
[16:57:51] <codebam> how can I get [{a: b}, {c: d}] from {a: b, c: d}?
[16:58:02] <linearbit> It seems odd since all of this would be prevented by firing the load event when its attached if the page is already loaded internally

[22:05:39] <janus> is there a library/snippet to turn ["a", {href: "about:blank"}, ["hello ", ["b", {}, ["world"]]]] into html?
[22:05:58] <janus> that way, i could write my dom generation returning that stuff, and i'd able to test it
[22:06:29] <ljharb> janus: you may want to look into jsx
[22:06:30] <janus> and i'd have a way to concisely represent something close to the dom trees
[22:06:33] <ljharb> at which point, just use react
[22:06:45] <ljharb> that array format isn't meaningfully different from what react does
[22:06:47] <janus> right, but i don't wanna use react... i am using vanilla js
[22:06:58] <janus> and this seems like a really simple transformation
[22:07:05] <janus> i am puzzled it should require a custom syntax
[22:07:12] <ljharb> why not
[22:07:28] <ljharb> janus: that format is a custom syntax.
[22:07:34] <ljharb> it's a DSL
[22:07:51] <ljharb> and sure, it's probably a simple transformation. but then you're inventing something new, and it's not vanilla js anymore
[22:08:12] <ljharb> iow, "the transformation" is precisely as vanilla as react itself is (you don't need to use jsx for react, it's just easier)

[22:13:42] <matsaman> the closest thing was unformalized, I will give you that

[22:18:18] <matsaman> sounds reasonable
[22:18:28] <ljharb> ie, react

[22:19:39] <blueagain> tbh the only reason react is successful is that the web components spec is so horribly broken.

[23:39:58] <blueagain> Yeah, I don't listen to other stuff on his show like comedians etc., most because I find it pretty boring and he swears too much.
[23:40:10] <blueagain> But occassionally there's a nugget.

[23:42:00] <blueagain> You know Huberman? He's kind Joe Rogan, just less dumb. He's actual scientist.
[23:42:21] <blueagain> an actual*
[23:42:52] <KevinX> i dont but ill search it

[23:44:15] <ljharb> blueagain: that's a low bar
[23:44:26] <KevinX> lol
[23:44:42] <blueagain> ljharb: What, being a scientist?
[23:45:15] <ljharb> blueagain: no, the other comparison
[23:45:31] <KevinX> Being less dumb than rogan
[23:45:39] <blueagain> Oh. Yeah.
[23:46:04] <blueagain> Maybe I should say "he's just not dumb".
[23:46:12] <KevinX> I like that about rogan though. Smart people explaining stuff to a dummy.
[23:46:36] <ljharb> KevinX: that's endearing when the dumb person is actually listening to the smart people
[23:46:58] <KevinX> yeah I think that's something that changed over the past 2 years or so
[23:47:10] <ljharb> but when they're both intentionally platforming rogue opinions and also believing dumb stuff, they're very dangerous
[23:47:10] <KevinX> I couldn't stand him at some point
[23:48:02] <blueagain> What I don't like about the Rogan is the over-proliferation of drugs and alcohol in his talks. Like, sure, do whatever you want, but stop shoving it into every conversation.
[23:48:16] <blueagain> Not *everything* involves drugs.
[23:48:54] <matsaman> former drug addicts can get really caught up in that
[23:49:14] <systemfault> Nobody listens to Joe Rogan for Joe Rogan... most people against him have never actually listened to one of his podcast episodes

[23:49:45] <systemfault> I don't give the slightest shit about Rogan but when he has a guest I'm interested in, I will listen to that specific episode.
[23:49:58] <blueagain> systemfault: I'm exactly like that.

[23:52:14] <KevinX> its a major problem

[23:52:42] <ljharb> lol of course it matters
[23:52:47] <ljharb> it's the entire reason rogan's dangerous
[23:52:51] <KevinX> not at all. it's like a staged interview too
[23:52:57] <ljharb> he uses his platform to help charlatans cause harm

[23:53:34] <systemfault> No, he's having a 3 hours long discussion with them... if what they're saying doesn't make sense, people are just going to reject him.
[23:53:37] <KevinX> often it's either rogan is recklessly underprepared, or they already planned the topics
[23:53:58] <ljharb> systemfault: that is empirically not what happens
[23:54:01] <KevinX> people aren't smart enough to do that
[23:54:15] <systemfault> Nah, it's free-form discussions with some pre-prepared points (if the dude just released a book then they'll talk about it for sure)
[23:54:28] *** Joins: dapinitial (~dpuerto@136-27-83-52.cab.webpass.net)
[23:54:29] <blueagain> I feel though, at least in the case of some talks, that they're somewhat promotional of a book etc. Like in Brian Greene's case, or in Snowdn's case.
[23:54:32] <ljharb> systemfault: if that were true then trump would never have been elected, let alone a bunch of other politicians
[23:54:42] <systemfault> ljharb: Keep thinking that...
[23:54:52] <ljharb> systemfault: i will, because it's true

[23:55:15] <ljharb> systemfault: and conspiracy nuts also aren't going to reject things that don't make sense
[23:55:18] <TubbyTommy> How do I name my JSON array elements?
[23:55:26] <ljharb> TubbyTommy: array elements don't have names. so, you don't.
[23:55:34] <TubbyTommy> Blasphemy!!!!!
[23:55:36] <systemfault> ljharb: Exactly... so it doesn't change anything.
[23:55:50] <TubbyTommy> It's called an "associative" array.
[23:55:58] <ljharb> TubbyTommy: that's an object
[23:55:59] <systemfault> TubbyTommy: JS is not PHP...
[23:56:05] <ljharb> TubbyTommy: and basically only php calls it an "associative array"
[23:56:11] <ljharb> TubbyTommy: in almost every other language, an array is just a list
[23:56:43] <TubbyTommy> JSON doesn't support an associative array syntax? Well...I'll be dammed1
[23:56:51] <ljharb> TubbyTommy: it does. it's called "object literal syntax"
[23:56:57] <ljharb> TubbyTommy: because *nobody calls it an associative array* outside of php
[23:57:11] <TubbyTommy> Oh, I'm using the wrong terminology okay
[23:57:19] <systemfault> In Java, it's a Map... In C# it's a Dictionary... etc
[23:57:22] <ljharb> TubbyTommy: `[ ]` is an array. `{ }` is an object. arrays are lists of (unnamed) items. objects are dictionaries of keys paired to values.
[23:57:27] <systemfault> "Associative array" is really just a PHPism
[23:57:43] *** Quits: trevors (~trevors@user/trevors) (Quit: trevors)
[23:57:51] <TubbyTommy> So, if I want to name my elements of an array they, in reality, must be objects first.
[23:58:05] <ljharb> yes
[23:58:10] <TubbyTommy> Okay, thank you.
[23:58:41] <matsaman> https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=associative+array
