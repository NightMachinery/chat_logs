[01:47:09] <vvdaiwrw> k, but that wasn't even going through my mind, it's to reject nice PR's solely for sake of anecdotal bench, which border ~0ms relevance.
[01:47:48] <keir> UndeadLeech: as far i'm concerned, they publish *how* they benchmark, they don't publish their results
[01:48:29] <UndeadLeech> keir: The benchmarking is fully automated to detect regressions: https://github.com/alacritty/termbenchbot
[01:48:54] <UndeadLeech> Comparisons with other terminals have been published in the past, but that's very labour intensive and mostly pointless.
[01:49:10] <vvdaiwrw> dude posts nice PR, "oh, I'm concerned with that 0.0000001ms latency increase, please improve your PR, we consider that a regression".
[01:49:18] <UndeadLeech> vvdaiwrw: Which PR are you talking about?

[01:51:15] <UndeadLeech> vvdaiwrw: That PR just isn't nice.
[01:52:21] <UndeadLeech> The implementation is lackluster and misses essential performance comparisons to an alternative implementation, which was made possible by a different patch.

[02:00:28] <vvdaiwrw> UndeadLeech: seriously, and tbh, if you have other such reasons, it needs to be made clearer there. I pointed you a factual thread of though on how it's really easy to interpret dismissal solely upon a ~0ms perf increase.
[02:01:02] <UndeadLeech> I don't care why other people think PRs might or might not be merged. That's not really my problem tbh.
[02:01:45] <UndeadLeech> If people disagree with that, everyone's able to fork and merge stuff in their local branches. Works like a charm.
[02:02:14] <vvdaiwrw> weird as even PR author may be in the same boat, guess that makes a project not worth of PRs at all.

[04:44:49] <m_ben> vvdaiwrw: interesting since I also use Terminus. one thing that annoys me in xfce4-terminal is that you can't specify the font size of the fallback fonts. currently emojis and other glyphs are for some reason drawn much larger than the Terminus font characters

[04:46:20] <m_ben> but you can't specify different font sizes for each individual font
[04:46:58] <vvdaiwrw> that's possibly configurable then, cuz it's quite flexible.. now, if you check the latter thread linked, I've hit that kind of problem with wez too, but I figured a way how to cope with it in there
[04:48:50] <vvdaiwrw> the trick is that bitmap fonts are "quantum", ttf's are not. I didn't have to deal with this on alacritty (oh that trigger) because it by default happens to make my mix of fonts look fine, but this didn't happen on wez

[04:50:13] <vvdaiwrw> so I figured two tricks to handle this, first, setting font for some broken size, like 10.5, made bitmap font not yep increase/decrease its weight, but made the ttf font do it.

[08:00:17] <dre> no, it's on the letter at the end.

[15:46:58] <lopid> you must highlight the number in all the lines you want to operate over

[15:47:54] <romainl> https://pastebin.com/J0ZfB9YT [J]oules this is what you are supposed to give us

[16:09:57] <[J]oules> lopid it is partially working. The second 100 column 4 doesn't increment
[16:10:00] <romainl> if you manipulate csv for a living or as part of your work, you owe it to yourself and your coworkers/boss/clients to know excel or at the very least some alternative
[16:10:49] <lopid> you must put the cursor at the start of the first number to be changed, then press .
[16:11:10] <lopid> that means going back up to the top, or the second line
[16:11:34] <[J]oules> lopid: so, Y350P<c-v>Geg<c-a>w  then move cursor to column 4 and press . ?
[16:11:40] <lopid> but the change to the first seet of numbers should have taken you back already
[16:12:21] <lopid> the "w" at the end of that represents taking you to the next number. you can substitute it for whatever movement takes you there, even if that's pressing w a few times
[16:14:12] <lopid> the "." repeats the last change that you made, but it might not work if you've messed around since then. you can instead change the new set of numbers by highlighting them just the same way you changed the first

[21:13:24] <mmercer> romainl: my vimrc is pretty... hrm....  not standard compared to most peoples ;)  ive made a lot of changes to it over the years that im quite comfortable with, but occasionally i do learn about new features, anyone that says they know everything about vim is a liar xD
[21:13:43] <habamax> "standard"
[21:13:46] <romainl> there is no such thing as a standard vimrc
[21:14:14] <mmercer> lol, there are certain rules most people seem to agree on though, like dont make it long, make it take too slow to load, etc...
[21:14:22] <mmercer> i think my most recent change breaks that paradigm unfortunately
[21:14:24] <romainl> no
[21:14:47] <romainl> there is no universal rule
[21:15:19] <romainl> best practices, yes, and some of them might be debatable, but no rules
[21:15:28] <romainl> and certainly no standard vimrc
[21:16:59] <mmercer> fine -- i ignore some of the best practices :p
[21:17:00] <mmercer> lol
