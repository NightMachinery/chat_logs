[01:35:26] <phenom> Joanna, No doubt. I can't imagine the power Un wields over his people.
[01:36:13] <phenom> N koreans think Un is a God. In the least, they are willing to portrait him as one.
[01:36:59] <phenom> I'm curious how many of them truthfully think he's a God, vs how many are playing the game and pretending he is just so they can continue to breathe daily.

[02:08:55] <Joanna> How about the cocanut grove fire?

[02:27:16] <phenom> States have differenct rules unfortunately.
[02:27:33] <Joanna> It should let people out immediately without delay. This seems to be a cyclical phenomenon. Some big fire happens then things are made safer then they go back to being death traps then another disaster kills a bunch of people

[02:29:10] <phenom> There is always a dispute between fire and securityh industries
[02:29:35] <phenom> Truth be told, a fire is mor likely to happen than a terrorist attack under most curcumstances.
[02:30:04] <phenom> And since the fire safety systems intersect with ours, we need to work together.
[02:30:07] <Joanna> Another thing people who are panicked will try to run to the door they usually use and not try the exits. It’s kind of scary going a way you have never gone before when building is on fire
[02:30:26] <phenom> +
[02:30:58] <phenom> There are a lot of nuances to fire safety. And they are all very much relevant to physical security.

[02:32:07] <phenom> One of the hardest things to do in the realm of physical security is to design and install a fire door package that will be acceptable by an AHJ.
[02:32:17] <Joanna> I’ve been seeing a trend back towards one point of entry and exit lately and try to avoid places that do that. If you are ever in a disaster follow the employees they know the way out..
[02:32:27] <phenom> You need to know the relevant codes in the State/County/City bleh
[02:33:52] <phenom> If I'm in a fire, I'm looking for the exit signs. :O

[02:34:01] <phenom> Those are there simply because of fire code
[02:34:10] <Joanna> From what I’ve seen of building designs I don’t have  much faith in building codes. I’d say builders are working with the power companies to make sure as much energy as possible is used.
[02:34:32] <phenom> If you follow one of those sings, it will lead you to a door that either opens immediately, or within x seconds without human interaction. :P
[02:34:41] <Joanna> Not always
[02:34:57] <phenom> Joanna, I'd hope so, otherwise the AHJ didn't do their job.
[02:35:05] <phenom> And the architects are shit.
[02:35:25] <phenom> I can go to jail if I don't put a resistor in a security system in my County.
[02:35:45] <phenom> There are legal/civil liabilities if they don't adhere to certain codes as well.
[02:36:22] <phenom> I should say, that failing to adhere to industry best practices can lead to a class a misdemeanor in my county.
[02:36:34] <phenom> In my State really.
[02:37:07] <Joanna> The Iroquois theater fire the doors were only a small part of the problem and the problem of greed has not been solved yet.
[02:37:30] <phenom> I have to carry 1 million dollare of insurance to practice in the security industry in in state
[02:37:55] <Joanna> Also I believe the owners of theatre pretty much got away with murdering a lot of people as did the owner of the shirtwaist factory

[02:41:26] <Joanna> The fact remains that things will always go back to being unsafe because business owners are worried about theft or employees slacking. It wouldn’t be so hard to design a store with half the cash registers on each side with two entrances but they don’t. The favored trend seems to be a culdesac with one way in and out.
[02:42:19] <phenom> Joanna, Right. Truth be told, I don't think business owners know how to design a business with fire safety in mind.

[06:58:21] <ornxka> there is really no service that does this? even for money?
[06:58:24] <ajak> CVEs are sort of fundamentally incompatible with tracking vulnerabilities in softwares in a sane way like this
[06:58:37] <ajak> oh i don't know about money
[06:59:38] <ornxka> well, when i say "money", i dont mean a whole lot :p certainly nothing involving a negotiation
[06:59:58] <ornxka> i guess the best i can do is find a CVE feed and grep for keywords
[07:00:02] <ajak> yeah, i have no idea
[07:00:08] <ajak> but yeah that's your best bet
[07:00:20] <ajak> of course, there's also stupid CVE descriptions
[07:00:38] <ornxka> yeah some of them are not always that great,,,
[07:01:38] <ajak> yeah
[07:01:49] <ajak> and they often have shit references..
[07:03:49] <CoJaBo_> Just build an IOT bell-ringing device to periodically wget and grep recent CVE listings for the names of products you tweet to it, and have it tweet them back at you when a match is found.
[07:04:08] <CoJaBo_> You can test it by having it search for its own name, so you'll know immediately when it gets hacked =D
[07:04:57] <ajak> well hopefully someone requests a cve for vulnerabilities before they're fixed in $THING
[07:04:58] <ornxka> lmao
[07:05:16] <ornxka> thanks CoJaBo_ i will cut you a check when i make millions selling these things
[07:06:50] <CoJaBo_> ornxka: Thanks, just make sure I'm not liable for any losses =D
