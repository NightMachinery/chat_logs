[04:05:48] <Common-Lisp> What's that
[04:07:07] <Devon> A QuickLisp package whose test suite crashes in FFI because it has wired in the non-existend /opt directory.
[04:07:16] <Devon> Supposedly a code walker.
[04:07:19] <Common-Lisp> lol
[04:08:04] <Devon> Why a code walker would need FFI is beyond me.
[04:09:24] <Devon> Somewhere in my toy box I must have an old tree walking pattern matcher…
[04:10:14] <Devon> Perhaps it's time to fully bake in and promote it to the tool box.
[04:13:46] <zacque> Hi, why is there an extra "." in `(:export . #.*gray-stream-symbols*)` where *gray-stream-symbols* is a list of symbols
[04:14:19] <Common-Lisp> Isn't that just a cons
[04:14:31] <Devon> That will expand to (:export this that the other …)
[04:14:56] <zacque> Common-Lisp: This is inside a defpackage form

[04:15:39] <zacque> Devon: Oh... then what does "this" mean in this context?
[04:15:52] <Devon> Like foo bar baz
[04:16:21] <Devon> The elements of *gray-stream-symbols* at read time.
[04:17:15] <zacque> Doesn't it at read-time eval to (:export . '(foo bar baz))?
[04:17:45] <Devon> Which is the same as (:export foo bar baz)
[04:17:56] <zacque> Ohhhh?
[04:18:04] <zacque> Oh my
[04:18:11] <zacque> I see
[04:18:16] <Devon> Try '(:export . '(foo bar baz))
[04:18:26] <Devon> => (:export foo bar baz)

[04:19:18] <Devon> ok, not quite, I missed the quote

[04:21:08] <zacque> Nope, I'm fine with #.

[04:23:30] <zacque> Then with the dot, it behaves like (cons :export 'A(foo bar baz))

[04:24:58] <Devon> More like LIST* than CONS.

[04:26:28] <zacque> That's a new thing to me
[04:27:05] <zacque> But in this case, both give the same result
[04:27:39] <Devon> (LIST* …) is like (APPLY #'LIST …)

[12:39:49] <mfiano> Hmm, so is it Python or Julia that is now a Lisp, or are we sneaking in <programming> into the ELS schedule now? I understand Julia borrows heavily from Common Lisp, and its parser was initially written in a small dialect of Lisp, but this is a little out there I think.
[12:44:05] <beach> mfiano: Apparently, the referees thought it was on topic.
[12:44:28] <mfiano> Well, at least it isn't javascript again.
[12:44:52] <mfiano> I have some respect for Julia, probably moreso than other non-Lisps, but a Lisp it is not.
[12:46:44] *** Joins: dirtcastle (~dirtcastl@136.232.208.190)
[12:47:23] <mfiano> The problem is there is no generally agreed upon definition of Lisp, I suppose. So, pretty much anything is. Sigh. Oh well, looks like a fun lineup in any case.
[12:48:42] <mfiano> Can anyone map an IRC nick to Michael Wessel if one exists? I like to get an idea of who is working on things; they seem to be the only other person presenting a CL topic.
[12:50:13] <beach> Er, what?
[12:50:32] <beach> Other than what other people?
[12:51:07] <mfiano> Other than you. Michael Wessel, presenting "An Ontology-Based Dialogue Managment Framework for Virtual Personal Assistants in Common Lisp". I'm not sure if I have seen them here before.
[12:51:32] <beach> heisig's work is also Common Lisp.
[12:51:46] <beach> The the April compiler is written in Common Lisp.
[12:52:02] <mfiano> Oh sigh. I forgot about them. I was looking at day 2.
[12:52:19] <mfiano> But I know those authors.
[12:52:52] <beach> I would be surprised if Didier's ETAP were written in anything other than Common Lisp.
[12:53:38] <mfiano> I suppose, yeah.
[12:53:58] <beach> And Stefan Monnier usually talks about Emacs Lisp.
[12:55:07] <mfiano> I am not interested in that. Editing my configuration every year or so is enough of a departure from CL.

[13:34:00] <lisp123> Kinda sucks if the rest of the world cant watch :(

[13:34:15] <lisp123> Oh cool - i'll register for that
[13:38:05] <mfiano> I don't think I want to participate virtually, then. Not without more information anyway. Seems kind of a steep price for virtual, and I don't even know what it'll be like.
[13:38:42] <Shinmera> I'll just say that I'm very unhappy that virtual attendance isn't free. Many other conferences have a free stream, since the main point of the conference to begin with isn't the talks.
[13:39:00] <Shinmera> But I'm not on the organising team this year so
[13:41:03] <mfiano> Yeah, this is a real disappointment.
[13:47:26] <lisp123> There seems to be some good talks with <programming>, will have a look before registering

[14:49:37] <beach> Except that we decided from the start that ELS was going to be affordable, in particular for students.  As I recall, 50€ was the on-site student rate that was decided on, and kept that way for a long time.  Ordinary attendance was 120€ last year.

[14:54:15] <beach> There is also the publicity aspect.  The other conferences you mentioned are more popular, so there are more people willing to pay a higher price.  We wanted the price for students to be low enough (subsidized in fact) that they would consider going just to check it out.
[14:55:14] <beach> I think ELS has been doing well.  There are corporate and academic sponsors too.
[14:55:28] <beach> But I think the problems have to do with co-locating with <programming>.
[14:55:55] <gin> yes, I agree. as someone who discovered Lisp very late in life, I too would appreciate if the conf can be made affordable for students.
[14:56:31] <gin> I never ever heard about Lisp in student life which I think is very sad.
[14:56:36] <beach> I mean, for the 50€ we charged for students from day 1 (if I remember correctly) there were 2 lunches and a banquet dinner included, so it was worth it just for the food.

[14:58:22] <_death> median monthly salary in a place like, say, egypt is around 500 EUR.. take away taxes and basic expenses.. can working person from egypt "virtually attend" ELS?
[14:58:55] <_death> they could last year..
[14:59:15] <beach> We got to use the conference room for free, we got the city to pay free transportation on the tram and bus system.  We got a subsidy from the university and also from the region.  We got a a free cocktail party by the mayor's office.
[14:59:51] <beach> So the actual cost of organizing the conference was very small.  Just the lunches and the banquet dinner.

[16:14:44] <jackdaniel> that's why there was "I think" at the end of the first part of the sentence
[16:15:55] <jackdaniel> I'm also not sure what was the scope of ILS
[16:16:52] <beach> Do you mean ILC?  It was more general than just Common Lisp.
[16:16:59] <jackdaniel> yes, ILC
[16:18:34] <beach> ECLM was very good, but like I said, did not have peer-reviewed papers.  Arthur and Edi organized it and invited people they thought had interesting ideas to present.

[16:20:09] <rotateq> Yes maybe when he got to be a professor in Hamburg. His newer six part series about quantum computing was nice.
[16:22:13] <beach> Yes, I think ECLM stopped when he got that job.
[16:23:00] <jackdaniel> either way I'm glad that ELS is rather inclusive for interesting topics, even when the language is not a descendant of LISP or Scheme
[16:24:34] <_death> may be better to judge a talk after it's made
[16:26:09] <beach> I still remember the ECLM that preceded the first ELS in 2008.  I was there handing out information about ELS, and Kenny Tilton was there, perhaps that's the ECLM when he presented his stuff (forget the name).  And he proclaimed loud and clear so that everyone could here it that he would NEVER attend ELS, because ECLM is the only REAL Lisp meeting.
[16:26:35] <beach> I guess that's why he hasn't been to any ELS yet.

[16:31:44] <beach> Ah, yes, you were there too that time I think.
[16:32:04] <beach> I remember you were given a standing ovation.
[16:32:06] <Xach> Not that time, no. I think my first ECLM was amsterdam
[16:32:12] <Xach> 2011
[16:32:18] <beach> Ah, OK.  Memory...
[16:32:50] <Xach> Lovely venue in a former church. A great time and lots of good CL stories. That is the year sharplispers was started in a chip shop after midnight.
[16:33:45] <beach> Interesting.
[16:36:48] <beach> So 2011 was when you presented Quicklisp?
[16:37:33] <Xach> No...it was a one-year retrospective on Quicklisp. I first presented (briefly) on Quicklisp at ILC 2010 in Nevada. People were interested but it was not clear it would be much better than anything that came before.
[16:37:44] * edgar-rft didn't know that there was a church before alonzo
[16:37:53] <Xach> And I won't say it's *much* better, but it has some sticky aspects that have helped it persist for better or worse.
[16:38:47] <beach> Xach: OK, I just meant that that was the ECLM at which you presented Quicklisp.  Not that it was the first presentation of Quicklisp.
[16:39:03] <Xach> I see. Yes, that was the time.

[16:46:25] <Xach> My first Lisp conference was the ILC at MIT in 2009, which had hundreds of people and had many well-known Lispers from the past decades present and presenting. I thought every conference would be like that. It turns out many of them simply lived near Boston anyway and it was easy and fun for them to attend.
[16:47:35] <beach> Heh.
[16:52:54] <Xach> I gave a lightning talk about making cat meme pictures with common lisp and Guy Steele was the timekeeper. What a time!
[16:53:15] <Xach> "i made u a stack frame" "but i ated it", said the scheme kitten
[16:55:15] <beach> Xach: Will you go to Porto?
[16:56:35] <Xach> beach: No, I won't.
[16:56:39] <rotateq> hui that sounds amazing :)
[16:56:46] <beach> Xach: Too bad! :(
[16:57:17] <Xach> I dearly miss my Lisp friends but I am averse to travel in general and international travel. I hope things get better soon.

[19:36:06] <jackdaniel> Guest74: do you plan to make a demo in a near future (i.e a video)? you ponder the topic of a gui toolkit for some time so I'm curious.
[19:36:59] <Guest74> sure, whenever all the underlying stuff is done.  There's just so much underlying stuff!
[19:40:14] <Guest74> so much tangental stuff.  I just wrote a simple wrapper around bluetoothctl so I can work with my controller so I could test the joystick stuff in evdev.
[19:42:16] <jackdaniel> I see
[19:44:41] <Guest74> I guess it would be easier if I just used clx instead of trying to write something that works without x.  After all, clx is deficient for my purposes.

[19:52:57] <NotThatRPG> @etimmons: I believe that there is a library that aims to give portable access (i.e., just smooth out the differences in different implementations) to the optimization parameters.
