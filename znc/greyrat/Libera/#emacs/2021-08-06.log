[01:05:57] <johnjay> shared data structure is weird.
[01:06:05] <johnjay> but i guess that's implied by it saying 'non-destructive'?
[01:06:20] <tali713> so they aren't the same operation, the results are not eq to each other, though they are equal to each other
[01:06:37] <johnjay> like if you give me the list (1 2 3) and i give you a new list (1 2 4) but replacing the 2 affects both lists. -_-
[01:06:38] <tali713> johnjay: ironically, no, but that's why it doesn't use setcdr/setcar.
[01:06:53] <tali713> johnjay: that would be a destructive op.
[01:07:13] <johnjay> well i guess it's only destructive if it's the same starting list
[01:07:40] <tali713> johnjay: what it does do, is allow you to test using eq to see if a particular subtree has been changed.  (e.g. you could mark it dirty by keeping a reference to a particular element of the tree.
[01:08:13] <tali713> while if you didn't preserve structure wherever possible, eq will always show that all subtrees are modified.
[01:08:28] <johnjay> true. so it's selectively changing subtrees

[01:16:00] <tali713> you are looking at an implementation detail.  it saves memory and potentially time as well.
[01:16:37] <johnjay> hrm so that (cons a d) is always actually making a new tree and returning it?
[01:16:43] <tali713> yes.
[01:16:48] <johnjay> interesting
[01:17:00] <tali713> johnjay: box-and-pointer diagrams make this obvious.
[01:17:10] <johnjay> right. maybe i s hould sketch it out that way
[01:18:32] <tali713> cons always creates a new pair cell (you can think a pointer to a pair, but there is no such thing as a cons cell that isn't pointed too), where each cell is a value, the value may itself be another cons cell.
[01:18:48] <johnjay> the (t cl-tree) also does work because it leaves the unchanged parts not updated
[01:19:08] <johnjay> right. the (cons a d) is the only thing creating new lisp objects which confused me

[03:21:47] <lisp-newbie> Hi, if I have an association list, and I want to instantiate an object where I want to check if the key is a slot in the object, and if so, use it as part of the instantiation process. Is there an easy way to do this programatically for any class I may give and any list of key value pairs?
[03:22:27] <bpalmer> it probably depends in part on your object system.
[03:22:31] <aidalgol> What do you mean by "instantiate an object?"
[03:22:33] <lisp-newbie> I googled a lot and couldn't find so many ideas. I'm trying with mopp:class-slots but I don't know what to do with the result
[03:22:41] <lisp-newbie> make-instance 
[03:22:52] <bpalmer> first, to verify: you're doing this in elisp?
[03:22:58] <bpalmer> are you using a package like eieio ?
[03:23:00] <aidalgol> Oh, noooo... EIEIO...
[03:23:06] * aidalgol flees
[03:23:09] <lisp-newbie> I want to have something like (make-instance 'class-name var and then the list of key value pairs :key value)
[03:23:16] <lisp-newbie> common lisp
[03:23:25] <bpalmer> lisp-newbie: you may want to ask in #lisp, then.
[03:23:26] <aidalgol> Oh, CLOS
[03:23:27] <lisp-newbie> never heard of eieio

[05:29:00] <twb> grym: USA, Australia, and (formerly) New Zealand were in the top 5 meat consumption per capita

[05:29:33] <twb> grym: just saying I'm not really surprised they served meat
[05:30:22] <grym> the difference with venison is 1. NZ believes (correctly, for their ecosystem) that deer are pests, so there's no season and 2. NZ has looser rules about resale of privately slaughtered meat than the US, so you can actually get game on the menu at restaurants

[15:09:13] <Viking667> It's also one of the reasons I've not made a real effort to keep the software upgraded to the latest, because it's a bit of a faff finding spare space on the hard drive etc.

[15:36:31] <alphapapa[m]> Viking667: It's not a "final quote".  It's a Lisp quote.  You need to read about Lisp lists and quoting.
[15:36:34] <Viking667> i.e. ("\\.java\\'"  .  java-mode)

[15:38:10] <Viking667> ohhhh, right. That's something I didn't know.
[15:38:36] <stm> You normally don't want to match middle parts of a filename for the mode, so this is how it works

[21:16:13] <cellofellow> could also be that git is slow and I just don't notice on one-shot commands while magit is calling out a bunch
