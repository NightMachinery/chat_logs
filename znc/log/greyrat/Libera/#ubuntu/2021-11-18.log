[06:54:12] <sarnold> hello
[06:54:16] <Belamos> which video cutting software would you guys recommend for a really slow computer?
[06:54:33] <Belamos> I tried kdenlive, which is good, but extremely laggy when it comes to an old PC
[06:54:47] <Belamos> even though I used "proxy videos" (small down-sampled videos as previews)
[06:54:52] <Belamos> the videos I need to edit are 4K
[06:55:27] <Belamos> I tried:  "losslesscut",  "openshot",  "kdenlive"
[06:55:55] <Belamos> the only thing I can think of would be ffmpeg in the command line.  But a graphical GUI would be nice.

[06:56:51] <sarnold> and doing video editing is just one of those things that is going to get much better with more capable machines

[07:33:14] <sarnold> I'd expect RAM and disk speed to be the biggest influences -- the more RAM you can get, the better, and the faster the disk you can get, the better; nvme is better than sata ssd, sata ssd is better than hdd. but you've got to have enough disk to store the video, and that makes nvme or ssd pretty difficult.

[12:58:30] <EriC^^> MrSassyPants: maybe you could use exfat, just to load grub, and have ubuntu on an efi partition

[13:05:44] <jkc> When you're trying to make something bootable across as many systems as possible, getting "how things boot" correct is kind of important.
[13:05:59] <MrSassyPants> It is, yes
[13:06:23] <jkc> Then maybe being less argumentative - and insulting - might be a good idea when someone is trying to help you better understand "how things boot."
[13:06:29] <MrSassyPants> But in this case, pedantry is pointless, because what is *meant* is unambiguous
[13:06:39] <MrSassyPants> There is no actual "Bios" anymore
[13:06:52] <MrSassyPants> there's no confusion about what screen or what part of the boot process is being talked about
[13:06:53] <jkc> I don't trust "what is meant." Words have meanings. That's why they exist.
[13:07:01] <jkc> Alright, I'm done with you. All you want to do is argue.
[13:07:28] <MrSassyPants> You wanted to argue semantics
[13:07:39] <MrSassyPants> I was like "dude its fine"
[13:08:38] <MrSassyPants> What I am more interested in is that the windows installer thing will not be confused by the presence of an install.swm (and install_2.swm) instead of the install.wim
[13:09:49] <EriC^^> i'd do the multiple partition thing MrSassyPants , easier, each os can live on its partition and use grub and some custom menu to load each
[13:10:07] *** Quits: wuseman (~wuseman@user/wuseman) (Quit: ZNC 1.8.2+deb2build1 - https://znc.in)
[13:10:23] <MrSassyPants> I tried that, realized ubuntu can't boot off exfat, and then decided to just make it one partition as there are no conflicting folders

[13:11:18] *** Parts: dhsc19 (~dhsc19@70.35.205.161) ()
[13:11:33] <MrSassyPants> The one partition solution has the issue that either ubuntu won't load (because it's exfat) or windows can't be deposited without a hassle (due to the 4gb file limit in fat32) and more exotic file systems may cause more problems
[13:12:15] *** Quits: thiras (~thiras@user/thiras) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)

[13:13:13] *** Quits: lowfi (~lowfi@159.196.17.52) (Quit: Leaving)
[13:13:50] <EriC^^> if you put ubuntu on a fat32, and put grub's efi in the exfat, maybe you can modify /efi/grub/grub.cfg that's what sets the $root partition and $prefix (where /boot/grub/grub.cfg) exists
[13:13:59] *** Quits: certiorari (~certiorar@m37-2-237-213.cust.tele2.se) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[13:14:17] <MrSassyPants> Yes, that would work
[13:14:17] <EriC^^> then that would load the menu off the fat32 ubuntu, and i think it could load ubuntu from the fat32
[13:15:13] <MrSassyPants> but then there's no reason to have it be fat32 either if all it boots is ubuntu, you could use ext2
[13:15:14] <EriC^^> i wonder how windows is making their 'usb installers' nowadays then, if fat32 is out of the question
[13:15:26] <MrSassyPants> ntfs
[13:15:38] <EriC^^> aha
[13:15:57] <MrSassyPants> Actually, UDF partitions might also work for both. The iso is actually UDF

[13:24:18] <Bendik> Hi. I'm a newbie with Ubuntu. I'm trying to install grass (a package) using "apt-get install grass". It installs version 7.8.2 while the version on the package repository (universe) is 7.8.5. Does this make sense?
[13:24:51] <jkc> Have you updated your apt cache? apt update?
[13:25:12] <MrSassyPants> 1. Have you done "apt update" before, and 2. what release of ubuntu are you on
[13:25:28] *** Parts: Lvl4Sword (sid483043@user/lvl4sword) (Leaving)
[13:25:33] <Bendik> Yeah. I also changed the ubuntu settings to use only "universe" to be sure it wasn't getting it anywhere else. I'm on 20.04
[13:26:28] <jkc> https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/grass
[13:26:39] <jkc> 7.8.2 is the correct grass version on your release.
[13:27:02] <Bendik> Oh, I was looking at impish
[13:27:20] <Bendik> That makes sense then xD Thanks

It's a software controller. But I'll dig a little deeper. If I can do it on Windows then there must be a way to do it on ubuntu :-)

[20:16:36] <Elliria> The first suggestion by Seth on that page works perfectly for me, counting only the files in the root directory and not recursing through and also not counting the subdirectories.
[20:17:18] <Elliria> That should be configurable, Gallomimia. I use Ubuntu MATE, so I don't have Nautilus, but it can surely do at least what my file manager does and then some.
[20:17:31] <Gallomimia> yeah. it should be.
[20:17:41] <Gallomimia> it should suck a lot less for being copyright 1999 too.
[20:18:04] <Gallomimia> will consider mate once again. thanks for the suggestion

[23:14:54] <rangersmyth> Thanks tomreyn | I am trying to get a vncserver to run on my kali machine (I am only been learning linux for 3 weeks, loving it) and the port is closed. I am not sure how to open it up to listen for incoming calls, or how to reconfigure using software, not sure which software to use for that. I didn't have a problem with a firewall as I had none installed. so I installed ufw and Firewall as an app. I learnt how to enable and disable
[23:14:54] <rangersmyth> sed VNCServer, Tight, Tiger and open and all have the same problem of not connecting to my 2nd machine.
[23:14:54] <rangersmyth> From my Linux laptop I can open a VNC to my 2nd machine (Win 10) and use it great! Buyt, I can't seem to VNC into the Laptop.
[23:14:54] <rangersmyth> Sorry for my english, I am dyslexic and thanks for the help!
[23:16:35] <rangersmyth> oerheks: sudo ufw allow VNS ( or sudo ufw allow OpenSSH)  or sudo ufw allow 5901:5910/tcp
[23:16:45] <oerheks> shortcut; sudo ufw app list # would give VNC ?
[23:16:55] <oerheks> sudo ufw allow vnc
