[03:25:22] <Joanna> Hi norayr: I finished the video you posted . I agree i also wonder why russia didn’t annex the two regions along with Crimea. Maybe because border was more difficult to defend than Crimea peninsula? Regardless there is no disputing the fact that the us was investigating billions of dollars meddling in Ukraine and that us politicians are invested in and profiting from the defense industry. There is a very long list of countries that 
[03:25:22] <Joanna> have been destroyed by us wars for profit all over the world. Ukraine will be no different. Unfortunately Ukraine has become a proxy war between the us and Russia. I hope it ends soon before entire country is wrecked.
[03:27:47] <Joanna> Also in video he said that Baltic countries were in nato and close to Russia. Maybe russian doesn’t consider them a threat because they are small and don’t have missile silos or nuclear materials?
[03:29:31] <jessicara> maybe should invade scotland for it's nuclear power station
[03:29:34] <Joanna> Also there was supposedly a promise made to Gorbachev that NATO would not be expanded if he let Germany reunite. That promise has definitely been broken.
[03:29:51] * jessicara doesn't recall any promise that nato wouldn't expand
[03:30:28] <Joanna> Who knows I wasn’t there
[03:30:50] <iz> that's what history is for
[03:31:09] <jessicara> which version of history though
[03:31:20] <Joanna> It’s pretty well known that NATO kept trying to assassination
[03:31:31] <iz> nato now is a different situation than nato vs warsaw pact days
[03:31:55] <Joanna> Of Charles degaulle until he sent it to German and then terrorism happened in Germany
[03:32:04] <jessicara> yeah nato has been picking on countries which can't defend themselves for a long time now apparently
[03:32:17] <iz> w/out the warsaw pact, it's a different dynamic
[03:32:31] <Joanna> Yugoslavia was ripped apart by nato
[03:32:42] <jessicara> probably will be again
[03:32:50] <jessicara> serb supremacy is back
[03:33:47] <jessicara> i think it would be interesting if it went the same way as ukraine
[03:33:53] <jessicara> with the same kinda reasoning
[03:33:54] <Joanna> If the Russians did nothing and let Ukraine follow the trajectory of being controlled by nato eventually Russia would be plundered and destroyed and chopped up into several smaller countries
[03:34:12] <iz> well
[03:34:43] <iz> it's more like russia didn't want ukraine to join nato, b/c they think that land belongs to russia and want to be able to use thier military to take it w/out interference from other countries
[03:34:55] <jessicara> ukraine couldn't join nato anyway
[03:35:11] <iz> it's more like an israel/palestine situation
[03:35:22] <jessicara> donetsk and luhansk existing kinda prevents it joining nato
[03:35:44] <Joanna> Ukraine was a defacto nato country being used as a weapon against Russia with NATO provided weapons and troop training
[03:35:47] <jessicara> so it's borders are duspited
[03:35:50] <jessicara> disputed
[03:36:08] <jessicara> ukraine is an aspiring member not a member in pfp or full
[03:36:28] <iz> yeah, but that's why putin was demanding they never be allowed to join
[03:36:35] <jessicara> basically it would be stuck in that state until the border dispute settled
[03:36:48] <Joanna> It doesn’t have to join NATO to attack Russia it just needs to be manipulated and used as a weapon against Russia
[03:37:06] <iz> it's very telling about what your intentions are when you make demands like that
[03:37:15] <jessicara> is interesting russia is completely innocent in this
[03:37:34] <iz> lol
[03:37:58] <iz> that's what russian state media is telling ppl, for sure
[03:38:03] <jessicara> every country is guilty of genocide and uses stasi-like and targetted killing
[03:38:17] <iz> yeah, that's called history
[03:38:26] <jessicara> yeah, and it's called statecraft
[03:38:32] <jessicara> you cannot have a state without defending it
[03:38:36] <iz> yup, it's how it happened
[03:38:51] <jessicara> that means removing the opposition whether by manipulation or killing
[03:38:57] <jessicara> both nato and russia
[03:38:59] <Joanna> If Russia had done nothing and just let the Ukrainians keep expanding military the Ukrainians would have probably tried to take back Crimea and the russian regions and launched dirty bombs into Russia
[03:39:37] <jessicara> and often countries within nato against other nato countries because it's not one unified npc bloc like people seem to see it
[03:39:39] <iz> you are so easily influenced, i can't tell if you are just trolling or parroting what you've been fed, Joanna
[03:40:13] <Joanna> iz: are you from that area?
[03:40:31] <iz> nope, i have several friends that are though
[03:40:42] <iz> well, like 3
[03:41:20] <Joanna> It’s rather obvious that the us wants to conquer the world. How can people forget all the countries attacked by the us ?
[03:42:13] <iz> that's tangentially related at best
[03:43:01] <iz> you are letting your feelings about other things prevent you from evaluating the situation based on what's actually happening
[03:43:02] <Joanna> For us business interests. Sure this is nothing news the Spanish French Dutch and British liked to conquer and plunder also
[03:43:27] <Joanna> iz: ok what do you think will happen ?
[03:43:29] <iz> yeah, that's true, but doesn't really relate to the russia/ukraine situation right now
[03:44:13] <Joanna> Give us your predictions and we will see who is right
[03:44:38] <iz> what do i think will happen?  i think russia will be sanctioned into being like north korea level of technology and commerce while spreading thier remaining resources too thin trying to take ukraine
[03:44:54] * jessicara thinks nato will fall like dominos
[03:44:57] <iz> or putin will be overthrown before that fate happens to russia
[03:45:37] <iz> yeah, we'll see what happens
[03:45:44] <Decker> http://annesastronomynews.com/photo-gallery-ii/galaxies-clusters/macs-j1206-2-0847-or-macs-1206-for-short/ pretty picture.
[03:46:01] <jessicara> nato countries are ignoring their own internal issues, this is the perfect wedge for putin to insert support in to both sides
[03:46:33] <iz> support from whom else though?
[03:46:35] <jessicara> are already seeing increasing authoritarianism and stuff like the left are a national security threat for not being conservative enough..
[03:46:36] <iz> russia and russia?
[03:47:41] <jessicara> of course, and to some degree others who want in on the same effect
[03:47:50] <iz> if you are totally isolated from the rest of the world in terms of technology and commerce.. it's not a good place to be as a country
[03:47:56] <Joanna> Ok my prediction is that this war will cause a lot of suffering and death in countries not involved in it because the agriculture production is being interfered with. There will also be an energy shortage for countries supporting sanctions. The higher cost of fossil fuels will cause crops to not be planted or food costs to be much higher.
[03:48:01] <jessicara> the point is to distort smaller movements in to larger monsters
[03:48:40] <iz> food costs will be higher, b/c a lot of it was exported from ukraine and russia
[03:48:44] <Joanna> The Americans are practically jumping for joy over this way because they can sell weapons
[03:48:44] <jessicara> and yeah i think this is going to be particularly bad for many poorer countries, and russian civilians
[03:49:09] <jessicara> some newscasters sound like they want ww3
[03:49:25] <jessicara> "it would be so easy, just bomb them"
[03:49:30] <jessicara> at the huge convoy
[03:49:48] <Joanna> iz: and agriculture is dependent upon fossil fuels so   Everyone who does “modern farming “ will be affected
[03:50:10] <iz> Joanna: there is a more direct reason for it that will have a much bigger effect sooner
[03:50:13] <jessicara> europe is in a rush to get more gas it seems
[03:50:40] <jessicara> think most of the wheat is from ukraine and russia too
[03:50:44] <iz> yeah, jessicara 
[03:51:15] <Joanna> Another thing is the dollar may be eliminated as the world reserve currency as countries use the alternative to swift to get what they need
[03:51:18] <jessicara> there's also certain resources like sapphires used in some things
[03:51:18] <iz> ukraine used to do a lot of the wheat exports
[03:52:11] <iz> that's a cryptocurrency hodler's pipe dream, Joanna 
[03:52:28] <iz> probably won't happen any time soon
[03:53:12] <jessicara> usd seems in a better position than before actually
[03:53:17] <iz> but there's some guy w/ a neckbeard that can't wait to talk to you about bitcoin that thinks for sure it's gonna happen next year
[03:53:24] <jessicara> america is just so far removed to be threatened with resources
[03:53:26] <Joanna> Russia started making an alternative to swift back in 2019 and China and India are already on board
[03:53:37] <jessicara> even uk has minimal russian gas compared to europe
[03:53:40] <jessicara> like 6%
[03:53:42] <Joanna> Other countries will join too
[03:53:50] <jessicara> something like <1% for usa
[03:53:54] <iz> nah Joanna 
[03:54:02] <Joanna> iz: we will see
[03:54:18] <iz> you are buying into some internet rando's delusion
[03:54:38] <jessicara> name of the channel seems kinda fitting for what people are going to have to learn to continue
[03:54:57] <jessicara> the being in a certain mind being the enemy
[03:54:59] <Joanna> If the dollar isn’t reserve currency anymore Americans will be in big trouble and won’t be able to import things cheaply anymore
[03:55:13] <jessicara> purge against the western mindset
[03:55:40] <jessicara> means it's time to look very closely at individual and assess whether they should be prevented from being a problem
[03:55:43] <iz> people have been saying USD is about to crash since the 1990s for various reasons and they all thought it was going to happen soon
[03:56:15] <Joanna> Yea they have
[03:56:20] <iz> it's really not a risk you have to worry about
[03:56:37] <iz> it's like worring about gravity maybe reversing on you
[03:57:12] <iz> when USD is really in trouble, it will be apparent
[03:57:14] <Joanna> There could be inflation. Does America have infinite money to spend on meddling in other countries and other destructive activities?
[03:57:48] <jessicara> seems at the tail end of covid is the worst inflation for now
[03:58:05] <jessicara> it could always get worse again, we were lucky relatively with omicron i think
[03:58:30] <iz> you are just spinning your wheels with hypotheticals that don't matter when trying to find a reason why USD will fail soon
[03:58:30] <jessicara> couldn't have asked for a milder one to outbreed the worse
[03:58:51] <Joanna> I don’t want US dollar to fail
[03:59:14] <jessicara> i wonder when people will justify using chemical weapons on ukraine
[03:59:38] <Joanna> If other countries stop accepting dollars that will be the end of it
[03:59:52] <iz> lol Joanna 
[03:59:55] <jessicara> isn't about the ukrainian people it's about halting nato, anything to reach that aim could be justified
[04:00:03] <iz> that's what i mean by spinning your wheels with hypotheticals that don't matter
[04:00:09] <Joanna> jessicara: it’s a very dangerous thing for sure escalating the war in Ukraine
[04:00:20] <jessicara> i think it is interesting why people accept american dollars
[04:00:35] <iz> because it's the strongest currency to hold in the world?
[04:00:38] <Joanna> It’s just created out of thin air really
[04:00:38] <iz> makes sense to me
[04:00:47] <jessicara> people want an easy exchange which doesn't inflate itself out of existance suddenly or collapse like some others might
[04:00:54] <jessicara> so keep in the stablecoin
[04:00:58] <jessicara> and exchange stablecoins
[04:01:02] <iz> yeah, basically jessicara
[04:01:03] <jessicara> the stablecoin is usd
[04:01:10] <Joanna> They trust the dollar to keep value because the country that issues it is strong
[04:01:16] <iz> USD is the measure by which all other stablecoins are pegged
[04:01:24] <jessicara> it's basically the best option, the moment it isn't the best optiion people will leave it
[04:01:26] <iz> in the cryptocurrency world
[04:01:36] <jessicara> it will take a long time to gain trust to encourage others to leave it too
[04:01:42] <jessicara> you won't miss it, it won't be sudden sneaky plan
[04:01:47] <Joanna> Usd isn’t even backed by gold or silver anymore
[04:01:57] <iz> most currencies aren't
[04:01:59] <jessicara> the gold was actually irrelevant
[04:02:27] <Joanna> If Russia is forced out of the financial system it won’t be using dollars anymore
[04:02:42] <jessicara> russia still has dollars it can spend even now
[04:02:47] <iz> except when they hide all thier money in safe places (in USD)
[04:02:54] <jessicara> much is frozen, but it still technically has it
[04:02:56] <Joanna> Aren’t it’s assets frozen?
[04:03:08] <jessicara> estimates are 1/2 are frozen to 2/3rds
[04:03:13] <jessicara> of non-hidden money
[04:03:26] <Joanna> So people whom russia owes money to get punished.
[04:03:27] <jessicara> hidden money is well, hidden
[04:03:33] <jessicara> yes
[04:03:36] <iz> well, russia has to pay back a bunch of money soon
[04:03:54] <iz> and they said they were going to have to pay it using ruples.. which basically means they can't pay
[04:03:56] <jessicara> russia seems to be heading for a technical default, could say
[04:03:59] <jessicara> yeah
[04:04:00] <iz> yeah
[04:04:10] <jessicara> means will pay back like half of it, assuming it doesn't get far worse suddenly
[04:04:32] <Joanna> Russia should have moved its money before attacking
[04:04:38] <iz> russia is on the path to becoming like north korea in level of technology and trade
[04:04:47] <jessicara> https://twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1499360322108469251 ← this was back when we thought it would be much lesser
[04:05:09] <jessicara> 10% permenant drop, is a lot
[04:05:23] <jessicara> like lost decade or three
[04:06:54] <jessicara> yeah, it's sad to see this
[04:07:01] <Joanna> iz: russia has fossil fuels and other things people want.
[04:07:09] <jessicara> yes but this is the end of glasnost
[04:07:18] <jessicara> like a reverse gorbachev
[04:07:54] <jessicara> this can only lead to suffering for the civilians
[04:08:19] <iz> Joanna: yeah, that china and india will happily buy at a discount
[04:08:28] <iz> china still trades with north korea also
[04:09:12] <jessicara> i imagine it's going to become harder and harder to get a vps in russia
[04:09:33] <iz> yeah, they want to do the china thing of not letting thier citizens see the outside internet
[04:09:54] <Joanna> iz: I’ve heard the saudis want to sell oil in yuan I expect they will get some attention from people who want oil sold only in dollars:)
[04:10:01] <jessicara> so far this hasn't happened, but there has been preparation for the possibility
[04:10:07] <jessicara> and preparation tends to come before action
[04:10:24] <iz> UAE abstained, just because they are perfectly happy to have an oil crisis with extra high oil prices
[04:11:12] <Joanna> iz: they have to control the internet to stop people from hacking their citizens and turning them into zombie armies ..
[04:11:42] * iz blinks a few times and then just shakes his head
[04:11:50] <iz> wut?
[04:11:54] <jessicara> interestingly haven't really seen the true capability
[04:12:04] <iz> that was sarcasm, right?
[04:12:09] <jessicara> it's mostly trying to open information channels
[04:12:45] <jessicara> some of the stuff i've seen, if that stuff was in action we'd all be in trouble by just being connected to the internet
[04:12:52] <jessicara> we aren't there yet
[04:13:42] <jessicara> if i were a russian spy, i'd be more interested in lifting all the data can get from nvidia, amd and intel
[04:13:54] <Joanna> Renting crowds and tricking stupid people into demonstrations is old news really
[04:14:02] <jessicara> and not like, unleash all the nightmares forcing people to lock down so lose access
[04:14:25] <jessicara> renting crowds?
[04:14:42] <jessicara> wonder if i should try that and see how many actually turn up
[04:14:49] <Joanna> Yea paid protestors/ agitators
[04:15:11] <jessicara> might be enlightening to see if most just leg it with the money or if they start telling the actual security services
[04:16:04] <jessicara> generally i think radicalization is a far longer process which takes one on one communication
[04:16:17] <jessicara> need to start with the cause then gradually distort things further
[04:16:22] <Joanna> Like in Iran they hired a crowd of thugs to go out on the streets and beat people up and say they were supporters of the guy that the people paying them wanted overthrown
[04:17:46] <iz> if i was a russian spy, i would have hacked okta...
[04:17:51] <iz> oh wait..
[04:17:59] <jessicara> yeah
[04:18:22] <jessicara> if i were cia i'd be keeping a distance from direct involvement, show up among the anons and dump a few sneaky sneaky things
[04:18:42] <jessicara> sneakily help people gain more access to do it themselves
[04:18:47] <iz> i'm convinced that's why TOR was created
[04:18:52] <jessicara> yeah
[04:19:10] <jessicara> there's been a lot of overlay networks, but none so promoted as this
[04:19:17] <Joanna> jessicara: they often piggyback on peaceful protestors with genuine grievances
[04:19:22] <iz> to give the cia plausible deniability... it was... random hackers, idk where they came from!
[04:19:30] <jessicara> yeah, some random tor exit node
[04:19:41] <jessicara> it could be jessicara watching anime, it could be a spy
[04:19:45] <iz> yup
[04:19:53] <iz> i mean.. gotta give them props for a clever idea
[04:19:58] <jessicara> yeah
[04:20:01] <Joanna> iz: aren’t things designed with backdoors for the us government?
[04:20:03] <jessicara> originally came out of the navy this
[04:20:10] <iz> yup
[04:20:29] <jessicara> there is some amount of backdooring with various levels of success
[04:20:41] <iz> there aren't really that many baked in backdoors though.. 
[04:20:51] <jessicara> yeah it's too hard to do that these days
[04:20:51] <iz> it's more like 0-days that they sleep on and keep secret
[04:20:54] <jessicara> ^
[04:21:09] <jessicara> there was a time would put backdoor passwords in everything
[04:21:12] <iz> and they have the research teams to find them
[04:21:21] <jessicara> but people are willing to slice chips layer by layer to find these
[04:21:29] <jessicara> so no, not anymore
[04:21:33] <jessicara> unless are really silly
[04:21:33] <iz> yeah, reverse engineering is too strong now
[04:22:30] <Joanna> Security by obscurity
[04:23:41] *** Quits: XV8 (~XV8@2601:5cb:c001:50::94d3) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[04:24:09] <Joanna> Maybe the idea is to do updates to change the vulnerabilities in code faster that people can find them...
[04:24:20] <jessicara> that has been a concern lately
[04:24:43] <jessicara> so far it seems really silly hacktivism 'attempts'
[04:25:09] <Joanna> With windows doing forced updates they don’t want just anyone having surreptitious access to things
[04:25:23] <jessicara> things could get a bit wild if start sneaking things from specific compromised authors in specific distros know are used in certain places
[04:25:34] <jessicara> have us all scrambling to actually verify the code
[04:25:35] <jessicara> lol
[04:26:31] <Joanna> It seems like a problem that should have been solved a long time ago
[04:26:51] <jessicara> part of the problem is the pure volume of software
[04:27:14] <Joanna> Because software has become like fashion industry
[04:27:35] <jessicara> like concider this, openbsd 7.0 alone is like 330gb with all it's arches and packages
[04:27:41] <jessicara> and openbsd is relatively small
[04:28:03] <Joanna> Is there any reason why there should be so many programming languages?
[04:28:05] <jessicara> something like freebsd/fedora is like 1.5tb and needs room to grow
[04:28:44] <jessicara> going through all of this and verifying it matches the code with the specific compiler version
[04:28:49] <jessicara> some task
[04:29:26] <jessicara> well, i'd argue that one language can never be optimal for a given task
[04:30:43] <Joanna> There just seem to be too many languages
[04:31:38] <Joanna> So how can people be experts at the language they are using if they have to learn new language every few years
[04:31:53] <jessicara> i don't think it's that severe
[04:32:06] <jessicara> if have an interest tend to read a lot about it too, and learn
[04:32:51] <Joanna> It really can take a lifetime to be good at just one language and know everything in it.

[04:39:08] <iz> you don't need to know everything in one language, you just need to know enough to use it properly.
[04:39:35] <iz> different programming languages are just different tools available to use
[04:39:47] <Joanna> Well of course
[04:40:08] <Joanna> But that is not being an expert
[04:40:58] <iz> you don't need to know everything to be an expert either
[04:41:22] <iz> if you are trying to learn everything, you are probably wasting your time with minutia that you can look up
[04:41:51] <Joanna> That’s being a technician. A lot of people are happy to spend their lives as technicians knowing hardly anything
[04:41:52] <iz> most procedural programming is the same, regardless of language
[04:42:30] <Joanna> The algorithms are the same
[04:43:00] <iz> the rest is just syntax
[04:44:03] <Joanna> It’s like the difference between people who need to look at their hands while playing musical instruments and those who don’t
[04:45:09] <iz> not really, that difference is just experience.. it's not like they know more about music
[04:46:27] <Joanna> The ones that look at hands are unsure of where the notes are
[04:46:55] <iz> that just comes with experience
[04:47:12] <iz> knowing more music theory won't teach your hands where the notes are on the instrument
[04:47:24] <iz> reading more books about it won't help either
[04:47:38] <iz> once you know how to program in general, programming languages are the same way
[04:47:39] <Joanna> Right
[04:48:11] <iz> you just need to jump in and start using them and after a bit of experience, you know what built-in structures to use, etc
[04:48:41] <iz> i think you are vastly over-estimating the amount of effort needed to learn a second programming language after you already know how to program
[04:48:49] <Joanna> I often forget how I programmed things I have looked at in awhile and that is really annoying..
[04:49:26] <iz> that's just how human brains work if you aren't still programming stuff
[04:49:41] <iz> same thing happens w/ foriegn spoken languages if you don't use them
[04:50:23] <Joanna> It seems worse than for other things. I never forgot how to ride a bike or swim
[04:51:07] <Joanna> I don’t forget the details of stories and events .
[04:52:19] <Joanna> Even with comments it hardly helps

[04:55:08] <Joanna> I think the hardest part of programming is the design and algorithms but if you are ignorant of language features it will not be implemented well
[04:57:38] <Joanna> So I think there is still a difference between being able to write in a language and writing well in a language.

[04:58:12] <Joanna> Hi carnophage2
[05:18:44] <jan6> riding a bike and swimming are really simple things, in themselves, and significantly rely on your existing experience with e.g. balancing, "why don't I forget how to swim, but I do forget how to program/speak X language/construct a simple binary calculator using only discrete logic/etc" are totally different leagues, lol
