This gives developers a deeper understanding of all the code interactions with side by side
[00:09:01] <feepbot> visuals of the app recording, enabling complete reproducibility of the bugs with barely any performance hit. In chatting with Replay users from Facebook’s React team and developers at Stripe, Sourcegraph, RepLit, CodeSandbox, and VSCode, we heard over and over that using Replay was like magic. Replay’s founders, Brian Hackett and Jason Laster, have dedicated nearly a decade to
[00:09:01] <feepbot> building this product, starting with Brian’s PhD work at Stanford. Companies like Microsoft and Apple have long tried to tackle this problem by building time-travel debuggers but Replay was the first to make the record/replay function work with extremely low overhead, across any browser and any runtime. Today, Replay is announcing that their product is generally available to

[01:08:29] <saturn2> getting married sounds so incredibly miserable
[01:08:48] <otoburb> saturn2: It doesn't have to be a big affair.
[01:09:05] <otoburb> Assuming that the expense and planning effort is what would make you incredibly miserable. 
[01:09:08] <gwern> but intrasexual competition means your would-be wife wants it to be
[01:11:26] <saturn2> right
[01:12:29] <gwern> (my sister, years later, if you bring it up extremely carefully, will admit that she and everyone else would have enjoyed her wedding noticeably more if she had planned & spent less)
[01:12:32] <saturn2> of course you *can* avoid all that, if you don't mind your wife resenting you forever
[01:12:58] <gwern> (I think it took like 4 years before they ended their dispute with the wedding photographer and actually got the damn photos)
[01:13:00] <kuudes> or marry someone aligned with your values so that you both are happy?
[01:13:20] <saturn2> lol
[01:16:24] <gwern> unfortunately, "are you a bridezilla?" is both way down the list of things you can afford to be picky about, not something the woman would necessarily answer honestly, and may be something about themselves they don't yet know
[01:16:57] <otoburb> 100% value alignment is difficult, let alone trying to find somebody who is highly compatible across other dimensions.
[01:17:08] <rmmh> we tried 'normal' wedding planning, found it rather stressful, and went with a package deal where the only questions we had to answer were two colors and what kind of cake we wanted
[01:17:41] <otoburb> There's also the super simple civil ceremony where only a few guests/witnesses are needed (usually parents from both sides).
[01:18:12] <rmmh> Limiting guests makes it far more reasonable and affordable, too. We had ~30.
[01:20:58] <gwern> otoburb: yeah, another sister learned from the first and, not being a rich techie as well, planned a much more modest one... and then corona canceled it, making it even more modest lol. I feel like that's possibly a pretty good outcome in terms of intrasexual competition: "I envy you your wedding, it was so beautiful... Mine was canceled by coronavirus, but [sob] I'll be strong."
[01:21:55] * gwern wonders if he's being too cynical. maybe the chicks are right. maybe he's out of touch. ...no. It's the chicks who are wrong.
[01:22:32] <otoburb> Not only does your other sister have a great reason for opting out of the intrasexual competition (without realizing it, maybe), but she now has more capital to deploy towards a house (which is usually the next large-ticket item for a newly married couple on the horizon)
[01:22:44] <rmmh> you're putting a lot of weight on 'intrasexual competition' and not mentioning the massive advertising apparatus convincing women that YES, they *should* spend an exorbitant amount of money if they're Truly In Love
[01:22:57] <otoburb> Aren't those two very closely related? 
[01:23:08] <gwern> rmmh: weddings were showcases long before that. the advertising follows the competition, not vice-versa
[01:23:48] <gwern> otoburb: yeah, they did buy a house. it was a pretty questionable move imo but I assume if they had went for the full wedding, probably even further out of reach
[01:23:52] <rmmh> of the aristocracy, perhaps
[01:24:17] <gwern> of course, both bought houses almost simultaneously as part of the corona house-buying frenzy, so in terms of competing, I guess they're still relatiely equal
[01:24:51] *** Quits: Lord_of_Life (~Lord@user/lord-of-life/x-2819915) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[01:25:11] <kuudes> yeah, that house buying thing is weird
[01:25:15] <otoburb> Not having any siblings of my own, do same-sex siblings compete around status, milestones, economic signalling, etc.? I assume the answer is yes, but am curious if that matches with anecdotes.
[01:25:51] <kuudes> I mean, I too am buying a house, but I was already in the "buying a house soon, any day now" for some 5+ years
[01:25:52] <otoburb> I've seen both ends of the spectrum, but never dove into it. 
[01:26:12] <kuudes> but I don't get what's the thing why people suddenly seem to want to buy housing
[01:26:56] <gwern> otoburb: my sisters definitely do compete. me and my brother do not, but I think that's in part because we're so divergent that comparison really makes no sense
[01:27:36] <rmmh> sisters compete more often than brothers because they have more social expectations of milestones
[01:28:24] <gwern> (it definitely does amuse me to watch them compete. one goes for a baby, so the other goes for an advanced degree. etc)
[01:28:30] <saturn2> advertising's greatest trick has been convincing the world that everyone's an aristocrat
[01:31:05] <otoburb> kuudes: I think the urgency to purchase primary-residence property (flat/house) is driven by job stability expectations and rent expense as a % of disposable income
[01:32:10] <rmmh> rent increases have been ridiculous recently, too
[01:32:15] <kuudes> oh?
[01:32:20] <kuudes> I haven't observed such
[01:32:59] <otoburb> rmmh: Right. Coupled with still-low interest rates (around the world), and depending on mortgage policies you could end up with a surge of renters seeking to buy (even if the majority don't end up purchasing in the end)
[01:34:15] <gwern> the justifications I heard from them were basically FOMO
[01:34:28] <gwern> I hope it works out for them. they sank in a lot of money
[01:35:38] <otoburb> At least it's an asset that people can usually continue utilizing even when it's underwater
[01:36:12] <gwern> fortunately, that's not a literal possibility in these cases... afaik
[01:36:25] <otoburb> ... FOMO indeed
[01:41:25] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Finally, we need to address the magic of genes. People put a lot of stock in genes for various ideological reasons. But the reality is a lot of environmental factors taken for granted by many (e.g., shared home environment) are a lot less clear and well understood than genes are. And yet the skeptical takes don’t rain down on social science inferences and correlations.
[01:41:26] <feepbot> Mostly because they’re not seen as insidious because they’re environmental. But causes are causes. When there is a great deal of environmental variation in an outcome that doesn’t mean that you can control it, or you even know what it is. A lot of what is in the “E” in the ACE model is mysterious. Many focus on genes because they’re clear and distinct.'

[02:28:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: I'm not sure I follow... presumably, he would've said things along the lines of "clearly we are fine with poor people dying and in fact want them to die, whereas celebrity lives matter", yes?
[02:29:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: But that's in the scenario where the servants are (for some reason?) required to be un-masked while the celebs are masked... which would still be hypocrisy (if a rather less likely form of it, given the circumstances)
[02:29:55] <gwern> something like that. "we force them to work on pain of imprisonment and homelessness, while forbidding them VITAL protection all so we can enjoy the power and expressions on their faces without unpleasant masks marring out festivities"
[02:30:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure, sure, but the point is the hypocrisy of the celebrities, not the mismatch between the requirements imposed on the help with "the science"
[02:31:26] <gwern> if there wasn't hypocrisy, he'd just pivot. as it is, he's in the strange position of trying to argue that the servants getting *more* protection than the elite is akshully-bad
[02:31:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> It seems obvious that for the servants to be wearing masks is, in fact, a good idea; that the celebrities aren't doing the same is foolish of them, but that's not what we're mocking them for
[02:31:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is he arguing that? I'm not sure I see it
[02:31:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe I just overlooked it because *I* don't think that
[02:32:36] <adiabatic> I mean, if I were working there you bet your ass I'd be wearing an N95
[02:32:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> The other point is that for the celebrities, not-masking is substantially less dangerous than it would be had the servants all been un-masked
[02:32:45] <gwern> like literally the first sentence:   'From the start of the pandemic, political elites have been repeatedly caught exempting themselves from the restrictive rules they impose on the lives of those over whom they rule.'
[02:32:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Yes, same
[02:32:57] <gwern> he also knows this, which is why he throws in this paragraph:  'Trying to find a cogent scientific rationale for any of this is, by design, virtually impossible. The rules are sufficiently convoluted and often arbitrary that one can easily mount arguments to legally justify the Versailles-like conduct of one's favorite liberal political leaders. Beyond the legalities, everything one does can...

But what was most striking about Pelosi's donor event was not the possibility of legal infractions but rather the two-tiered system that was so viscerally and uncomfortably obvious.'
[02:33:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Yes, but that's ... literally true? (That first sentence)
[02:33:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> All of that seems true, in fact!
[02:33:45] <gwern> this is him trying to forestall the commonsense point that actually, it is a good thing for the servants to be masked, and it's the elites who are making themselves worse off
[02:33:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> The fact that wearing the (N95) mask is a good idea in such cases doesn't actually seem to make any of that less true
[02:34:19] <gwern> he is desperately trying to forestall that argument by saying "gosh, the science is *so* complex, who's to say if masks *work*??? let's instead spend 20,000 words talking about how it is breaking the rules"
[02:34:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, right, they are making themselves worse off (but not nearly as much worse off as if they were to also let/make the servants be un-masked, note! i.e. they're parasitizing on the protection afforded *them* by the *servants's* masks) ... but the point is that they don't believe in their own rules, but still make low-status people obey them
[02:35:01] <Betawolf> It's not about the science, it's about the rules (which are also mostly not about the science)
[02:35:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, the criticism is taking place within the context of the status-based consensus reality in which the celebrities live
[02:35:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> And it makes perfect sense there
[02:35:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> What is happening in actual reality is largely orthogonal to that
[02:35:43] <gwern> yes, I think that puts it right
[02:35:57] <gwern> what greenwald is doing is purely on the political simulacrum level, divorced from any actual objective level
[02:36:20] <gwern> as such, he is trying to hide what objective claims he is implicitly endorsing
[02:36:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't know that he has any big ideas about what claims to endorse or not
[02:36:40] <gwern> because the objective claims are ones he knows his audience would be less fond of
[02:36:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> That N95s work? Yeah, I guess
[02:37:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyhow, the masks aside, I found the photos (and the AOC video clip) striking because of the whole "require people to carry their dress for them" thing
[02:37:35] <gwern> "it's bad for the servants to put on masks, and they aren't better off than the self-injuring elites, because masks don't work" is not a claim greenwald wants highlighted even though he wants it to be true so there's no complications for his otherwise-shooting-fish-in-a-barrel rulebreaking discussion
[02:37:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> That said people are masked just happens to be an extremely convenient status marker, in context
[02:38:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Yes, that's likely true... though I'll note that the whole thing is complicated somewhat by the fact that many of the servant class likely don't want to be wearing the masks

[02:39:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> (I wouldn't think this were true, except that I read DSL...)
[02:39:51] <gwern> I doubt many of the elites are all that fond of masks either, but so what
[02:40:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> So you have the celebrities, who don't want to wear masks despite claiming that masks work and are necessary; and you have the servants, many of whom also don't want to wear masks (and whose claims are irrelevant but who are probably less hypocritical); but the celebrities get to do what they want while the servants do not
[02:40:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> And again this is all orthogonal to the actual object-level fact that it would be better for everyone if they were all masked
[02:41:07] <gwern> well, safer. 'better' is very much a value judgment there about the activities in question
[02:41:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, sure
[02:41:14] <Betawolf> It's important for the underclass to reduce risk of transmission through public signs of compliance, but elites can do what they want. For everyone else, the law.
[02:41:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Safer is what I meant, in any case, I don't care to weigh the values here
[02:42:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> The whole thing certainly doesn't reflect well on said celebrities, I think that point remains pretty much intact
[02:42:32] <gwern> (that is, if you are going to have the biggest fashion party of the year in the biggest fashion capital of the world, which is designed primarily to maximize vicarious consumption/entertainment through video and photography, and it is worth doing at all, then it seems likely that it is best done *without* masks)
[02:44:25] <gwern> (oh, looks like newsom beat his recall, so california politics will remain boring)
[02:44:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh, no doubt, but on the other hand, that revealed preference, when revealed, is an exhibition of what the elites value, and how it is at odds with what they are, *at that very moment*, actively claiming to value
[02:44:58] <Betawolf> It reminds me of that photo of a bunch of kids with masks on in a room full of adults none of whom are wearing masks.

[02:59:44] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Putting all of this back together: Ebook devices are extremely compatible with an idea of bookiness that values holding and carrying a potentially large number of books at once; that prefers direct flow from start to finish over random access; that reads for the meaning and force of the words as text first, if not primarily; and that isn’t concerned with the use of books
[02:59:44] <feepbot> as stores of reader-added information or as memory palaces. Some of the reading that corresponds particularly well with this conception of bookiness includes fiction in general and genre fiction—such as mysteries, sci-fi, young-adult fiction, and romance—in particular. As it happens, these are exactly the kinds of books that have thrived on Amazon’s Kindle platform. The
[02:59:44] <feepbot> Association of American Publishers doesn’t track sales by genre, but Kristen McLean, a books-industry analyst for the NPD Group, confirmed that some categories of literary fiction sell more ebooks than print books. In the year ending this May, for example, 58 percent of romance-fiction titles and 60 percent of mystery and detective-fiction titles were purchased in ebook format.
[02:59:49] <feepbot> An independent publisher analysis came to the same conclusion.

[03:38:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: That article about climate moralizing certainly makes a solid central point but wow there are some strange bits in here
[03:39:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> So the author points out that building nuclear power plants would reduce emissions more than whatever dumb shit Prince Harry or Greta Thunberg want us to do, and then says:
[03:39:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Many people think that moralizing and advocating for technological fixes are opposites when in truth the latter depends to a great extent on the former. Societal elites must moralize for strange new technologies for them to be widely accepted.
[03:39:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hundreds of years ago, as windmills spun languidly in the countryside, British elites moralized against coal as the “devil’s excrement.” Over time, a revolution in morality led them to see that reliable, high-temperature coal was necessary for industrialization and progress. 
[03:39:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> The same revolution in morality must occur for nuclear."
[03:39:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... and I am not sure where he's going with that coal example. Like... there was a revolution in morality that made people see coal as good... and was this... a good thing??
[03:40:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Did they revolve from wrong morality to right morality, or what
[03:40:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or was it right then, but then became wrong later?
[03:40:32] <Betawolf> Well, it made industrial society happen. I guess there are a range of views on how good that was.
[03:41:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Isn't "coal is the devil's excrement" kind of true? Doesn't it cause some, like, genocidal number of lost QALYs per year
[03:41:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Isn't that the whole point of "we gotta go nuclear"
[03:42:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm just not at all clear on how this author sees morality. Does he think moral progress is real? Fake? Does "morality" just mean "whatever will get people to accept the thing I think is good"?
[03:43:15] <Betawolf> It's an awkward analogy to make because of that. 'Actually coal is good because we can build trains and stuff now' and 'Actually nuclear is good because it means we can stop using coal now'.
[03:43:44] <Betawolf> I guess implicitly the moral view is the view that it would be most convenient for everyone to have.
[03:44:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, that aside, it's also very, very strange for an article about how actually the hypocrisy of taking a jet to lecture people about lowering carbon emissions to then naively point out how nuclear power reduces emissions but doesn't require any sacrifices or lifestyle changes
[03:44:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Apparently missing (or ignoring??) that this is amenable to exactly the same analysis
[03:44:42] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: it causes genocidal numbers now but I'd expect in the pre-industrial british context it saved genocidal numbers. the fuel you use in lieu of coal tends to be, like, cow patties or you just go without. all those third worlders choking to death on their indoor fire fumes from cow patties and brush *wish* they had something as clean and powerful as coal...
[03:44:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> i.e., the sacrifices and the demanding thereof is the point

[03:46:28] <gwern> sure, but then there are other effects. it's still substituting for less desirable fuel sources, and where it is not, it's making useful things like iron
[03:47:05] <gwern> if we had to broad-stroke it, well, life expectancies ultimately went up over the industrial revolution, which was heavily powered by coal, so...

[03:52:03] <adiabatic> where'd I _just_ hear that burning damp wood will absorb like half the energy to heat the water in it? Probably Cooking Issues.
[03:52:23] <Betawolf> it also produces a lot more gunk in the air

[03:53:45] <kuudes> oh?
[03:53:52] <Betawolf> (it was a coal-mining area)
[03:54:28] <kuudes> hmm. if we would take on face value "fireplace is good when the society falls", would having coal to burn in fireplace be better than to have wood to burn there?
[03:54:58] <kuudes> people prefer wood here because of tax evasion - your own forest wood is not taxed, fuel bought from someone else is
[03:55:19] <kuudes> personally, I think fireplaces should just be got rid of or at least put to tax :-p

[05:32:29] <gwern> so, I was thinking about how a modern car delivers more concentrated speed than a medieval peasant would enjoy in an entire lifetime, and I concluded that probably the fastest any human went (nonfatally) before planes is probably cliff-diving, where you can freefall for 192 feet, which isn't enough to hit human terminal velocity but still should get you to at least 90mph.

Recently the Brazilian press has been reporting that the study did not properly obtain consent from its participants,
[06:38:49] <feepbot> many of whom apparently did not know that they were in a clinical trial at all. And Anvisa, the Brazilian health regulator, now says that some of the import paperwork for the drug itself appears to have been forged, and has suspended all import requests and all clinical work on the compound while it figures out what's happening. It should go without saying that none of these are
[06:38:49] <feepbot> wholesome signs of believable clinical data.

Over the next several weeks, the agency — which oversees products including
[06:48:49] <feepbot> sunscreen, cosmetics and cancer drugs, but these days is known for ruling on coronavirus vaccines and treatments — faces an onslaught of decisions. These judgment calls could help determine whether the coronavirus pandemic will be brought under control anytime soon or whether it will continue to menace the economy and spawn battles from one end of the country to the other.
[06:48:49] <feepbot> “There have been key moments in the agency’s history — and this moment, with all the decisions facing FDA, is definitely in the top five,” said Jeff Nesbit, who led the FDA’s communications during the George H.W. Bush administration. The moment is occurring as staffers find themselves overwhelmed and exhausted by a crushing workload; the vaccine operation alone faces
[06:48:54] <feepbot> three years’ worth of work that must be done in the next six months, according to one estimate. And it comes as some Biden administration officials are expressing dissatisfaction with the FDA’s pace and as the FDA regularly tangles with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over key vaccine issues. “I think we have got a real problem here,” said Eric Topol,

[19:12:48] <PlanckWalk> Therefore can't be normalized to a probability distribution.
[19:14:07] <kuudes> ?
[19:14:27] <kuudes> how so
[19:17:23] <PlanckWalk> The power law is  P(L >= t) = A t^-c  for lifespan random variable L and some constants A and c.  But setting P(L >= 0) yields only c = 0, which implies everything has infinite lifespan.
[19:17:47] <kuudes> isn't it just halflifes
[19:18:10] <PlanckWalk> (and therefore isn't lindy, because the ratio of expected value of lifespan to any given lifespan is infinite, not some real constant)

[19:20:11] <PlanckWalk> That says "future life expectancy"
[19:20:31] <nshepperd2> oh i suppose soi

[19:20:59] <PlanckWalk> The median lifespan for an exponential distribution is constant
[19:21:00] <nshepperd2> not an exponential
[19:21:12] <nshepperd2> the posterior of an exponential with unknown hazard rate

[19:22:06] <kuudes> "Conversely, however, only Pareto distributions with exponent 1 < ϵ < ∞ {\displaystyle 1<\epsilon <\infty } {\displaystyle 1<\epsilon <\infty } correspond to a lifetime distribution that satisfies Lindy's Law, since the Lindy proportion p {\displaystyle p} p is required to be positive and finite (in particular, the lifetime T {\displaystyle T} T is assumed to have a finite expectation value).[1] Iddo Eliazar has proposed an alternative formulation 
[19:22:06] <kuudes> of Lindy's Law involving the median instead of the mean (expected value) of the remaining lifetime T − t {\displaystyle T-t} T-t, which corresponds to Pareto distributions for the lifetime T {\displaystyle T} T with the full range of possible Pareto exponents 0 < ϵ < ∞ {\displaystyle 0<\epsilon <\infty } {\displaystyle 0<\epsilon <\infty }.[1] Eliazar also demonstrated a relation to Zipf’s Law, and to socioeconomic inequality, arguin

[19:22:08] <PlanckWalk> Then yeah, a posterior distribution with an improper prior doesn't need to sum to 1

Thirty years ago, a cousin from New Orleans was visiting, and when a panhandler approached and made his pitch he
[19:41:16] <Obormot\Arcturus>  exclaimed "Yes, my good man!," leisurely took out his wallet, and handed the guy a five-dollar bill. I was horrified, and as we walked away I yelled, "What the fuck are you doing? Are you totally insane?""

[19:46:04] <PapuaHardyNet> what is wrong with giving money to them
[19:46:20] <Betawolf> Well, then they have your money.
[19:49:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: What's wrong is (a) it encourages them, (b) they're likely to rob you when you take out your wallet (or pickpocket you thereafter), (c) they're likely drug addicts
[19:49:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> By giving money to panhandlers you are defecting against your community and harming everyone else that person (and others encouraged by his success) will interact with
[19:50:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This is also true of buskers)
[19:50:24] <kuudes> b is reasonable, a is borderline, c I don't agree matters

[19:52:00] <Gurkenglas> does the same reasoning apply to any other way that drug addicts might get money without ceasing to be drug addicts?
[19:52:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> This meme that giving money to panhandlers is "foolish/naive but harmless because hey it's your money, do what you want with it" is a bad meme. Giving money to panhandlers is bad. You are not doing good by doing it, you are making the world worse.
[19:52:58] <Urchin[emacs]> !picks
[19:53:06] <kuudes> I agree there should be welfare or something so that they don't have to beg, and organized begging has harmful outcomes
[19:53:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: Depends on the context; if the context is "this is a non-functional drug addict, who is on the street", then yes
[19:53:23] <Gurkenglas> what if you give money only to the apparently least harmful panhandlers?
[19:53:25] <kuudes> but in usa there sort of is no welfare to my understanding, so *shrugs*
[19:53:35] <kuudes> I am fine with people spending their welfare on drugs
[19:53:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: That only incentivizes them to appear less harmful

[19:54:23] <kuudes> sure, for some definitions of huge
[19:54:42] <kuudes> you guys have homelessness and poverty, so from my pov you don't have working welfare, it appears
[19:55:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> That reasoning is extremely silly
[19:55:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> We have homelessness because we can't figure out what to do with crazy people who can't function in society, not because it's hard or impossible to get money from the government
[19:56:08] <kuudes> basically we don't have homelessness
[19:56:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> As has been discussed here many times, this comparison is irrelevant because your demographs and our demographics are nothing alike
[19:56:44] <kuudes> I presume, but am not certain, that france has lower fraction of its residents homeless than usa
[19:56:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Oh, and by "can't figure out" I mean "know perfectly well, but can't do because of dumb political ideologies and similar pernicious memes")
[19:56:55] <kuudes> and france and usa are about comparable

[19:57:21] <kuudes> or I guess you can define that nothing is comparable to usa, sure
[19:57:27] <kuudes> and then indeed there is nothing to discuss

[19:57:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also, your guess is wrong

[19:58:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> France: pop. 67m; homeless pop. 300k
[19:58:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> U.S.: pop. 331m; homeless pop. 550k
[19:58:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, no, France is way, way worse in this regard than America
[19:58:59] <rsaarelm> Well, I don't know if they did that to schizophreniacs, but they used to have super low-functioning adult autists because they had "psychoanalysis is the only psychiatry anyone needs" thing going for stupidly long compared to other western countries.
[19:59:38] <rsaarelm> Also huh, that's pretty bad homelessess in France.

[20:02:18] *** Joins: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage)
[20:02:25] <kuudes> ah, usa does not count people in shelters
[20:02:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not true
[20:02:32] <kuudes> those are counted as homeless at least in finland
[20:02:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> That 550k includes sheltered people
[20:02:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In January of 2018 the federal government statistics gave comprehensive encompassing nationwide statistics, with a total number of 552,830 individuals, of which 358,363 (65%) were sheltered in provided housing, while some 194,467 (35%) were unsheltered.[7]"
[20:03:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Although some of these numbers are kind of obviously silly. Nigeria... 24.4 million homeless? What do they even mean by that??)
[20:04:23] <rmmh> "Wolfram rocks. He's the final boss of talented and gifted kids"
[20:05:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://borgenproject.org/homelessness-in-nigeria/ ... yeah I dunno. "The country is in chaos and terrorist gangs are rampaging through the streets" seems like a heck of an asterisk to "there are this many homeless people"
[20:05:34] <Robomot> 10 Facts about Homelessness in Nigeria - The Borgen Project (The reasons for this are numerous and complex. This article presents 10 important facts concerning the issue of homelessness in Nigeria.)
[20:07:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> So let's see, the U.S. has fewer homeless people per population than all of the following: the Netherlands, Israel, Sweden (!!), Luxembourg, France, Australia, the U.K., Germany, New Zealand...
[20:07:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Also lots of third-world shitholes of course)
[20:07:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Germany has almost 5 times as many as we do, ratio-wise! Wow
[20:08:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sweden has more than double
[20:09:20] <Gurkenglas> ...I don't see where in the Nigeria source they got their numbers, actually
[20:10:31] <kuudes> it feels odd to me that turkey would have lower fraction of people homeless than finland
[20:10:43] <kuudes> especially given how many syrian refugees there are
[20:10:47] <Gurkenglas> the linked pdf doesnt appear to contain the word nigeria from some manual fuzzy searching
[20:10:59] <kuudes> I wonder how much differences in counting different countries have
[20:11:42] <two2thehead> kuudes, you read my mind
[20:12:31] <two2thehead> "I don't think that you can compare Finnish govt stats and Turkish govt stats in terms of similar categories accuracy"
[20:12:48] <nshepperd2> Obormot\Arcturus: nigeria just has a lot of princes who have been kicked out of the palace
[20:12:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol
[20:13:09] <synthmeat> besides, what's even a "house" over there
[20:13:30] <nshepperd2> must be why they all need a $10000 advance
[20:14:50] <kuudes> ah, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-07-06/why-is-homelessness-such-a-problem-in-u-s-cities
[20:14:50] <Robomot> Why Is Homelessness Such a Problem in U.S. Cities? - Bloomberg (As economic disruption threatens to trigger a spike in housing instability, here’s an essential primer on the causes and consequences of a thorny urban problem.)
[20:15:02] <kuudes> "the PIT count doesn’t account for people who are precariously housed, shuffling among friends and relatives, and sleeping in cars or on the streets when good will dries up."
[20:15:12] <kuudes> "The U.S. Department of Education, which uses a more expansive definition of homelessness, estimates that more than 1.5 million public school students experienced homelessness during the 2017-2018 school year. In this wider universe of homeless individuals, few people interact with the homelessness services ecosystem. "
[20:15:53] <kuudes> yeah, then french and us homelessness are about comparable, france having a little less of it
[20:16:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Yeah, but how does France count it?
[20:16:53] <kuudes> yeah, that is a good question
[20:16:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Surely you could find a suitably larger number for France, if you looked
[20:19:47] <kuudes> maybe, not sure
[20:20:03] <kuudes> I know in finland that multiplier would not happen as those are already counted in
[20:20:22] <kuudes> ie the number of homeless in finland comparable to the first us number is less than 1/5 of the reported
[20:22:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> How can that be true? Like I posted earlier, of that 550k, like 2/3rds are housed!
[20:22:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Again:
[20:22:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In January of 2018 the federal government statistics gave comprehensive encompassing nationwide statistics, with a total number of 552,830 individuals, of which 358,363 (65%) were sheltered in provided housing, while some 194,467 (35%) were unsheltered.[7]"
[20:23:26] <kuudes> yes. and that does not count people living in their cars or their relatives or friends etc as mentioned there in bloomberg
[20:23:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> So of ~550k supposedly "homeless" people, ~360k are actually ... living in housing of some sort

[20:25:01] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd2: did you create your own OOP framework for jax because vanilla / functional jax is miserable to use?
[20:25:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> So it doesn't matter how you count people to place them in a category you call "homeless"
[20:25:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> The question is "how many people are on the street"
[20:25:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> And the answer is, not that many
[20:25:30] <PapuaHardyNet> also feep could you allow your bot to take an arbitrary list of usernames to ".seen"?

However, these numbers do not take into account those people without shelter, considering how difficult it is to quantify."
[20:27:11] <kuudes> so 300k-185k-100k-16k
[20:27:28] <kuudes> so, maybe 16k?
[20:27:42] <kuudes> other people have some sort of roof on top
[20:27:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: "these numbers do not take into account those people without shelter" so uh... does that mean there's even more "people without shelter" not counted there
[20:27:56] <kuudes> yes, the same as in usa
[20:28:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> nnno...
[20:28:04] <kuudes> that whole 500k -> 1500k
[20:28:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, those aren't "people without shelter"
[20:28:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Those are people *with* shelter who are nonetheless, in some broader sense, "homeless"

[20:33:06] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm not sure whether it is due to the usual code quality of ML researchers (shawn speaks very highly of the code so it may not be that), or because the beta-ness of JAX (causing them to stick with a specific set of dependencies, or the use of haiku
[20:33:41] <gwern> shawwn is probably praising the results, not the code's squishier qualities

[20:35:05] <nshepperd2> in ML it's good code if you can understand how to run it at all
[20:35:32] <two2thehead> gwern, an excellent opportunity to ask the following. Is there a metric for scoring or measuring code? Similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests
