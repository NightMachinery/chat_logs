[00:27:03] <dale> gxt: I didn't look very hard but this really doesn't look bad.  My top suggestions are to use named functions rather than lambda for binding to keys, so you can figure out what they do by their name in six months, and you _might_ prefer to use (format) instead of some of those (concat)s.

[01:07:13] <dale> *a new one _on me_
[01:07:17] <horribleprogram> but this is similar to an Operating system that has certain keybinds... a window system... etc etc

[02:59:41] <williewillus> oh nice. I thought the whole gui was already GTK. What does it use right now then?
[02:59:49] <bremner> erpicht: well, elisp is a general purpose programming language. So you can do what you want. My experience suggests maintaining an OS is more of a social problem than a technical one, and I don't think doing everything in elisp will help with that
[03:00:24] <wgreenhouse> williewillus: emacs historically wrote its own stuff against X primitives, not using any toolkit at all
[03:00:35] <bremner> erpicht:  also, you'd still have to learn whatever packaging thing someone implemented. Just because you know emacs doesn't mean you know gnus, for example.
[03:00:40] <williewillus> TIL
[03:01:32] <wgreenhouse> williewillus: as bremner says, pgtk means you might be able to display emacs on various non-X gtk display targets (like wayland, or http over broadway)

[09:09:41] <bpalmer> I will admit to a similar strategy: I use android studio on the rare occasion I mess with java.
[09:10:55] <bpalmer> but that's as much because I don't want to figure out the phone part by hand as I don't want to figure out the java part (and then I started playing with flutter, which *also* "just works" with android studio)

Supported are Emacs 28, 29 and some unknown set of releases below 28.  Maybe someone will find it useful.

[09:51:00] <bpalmer> so file local variables  are insufficient, because they are set at the wrong time, or you want to apply this to new files located in that directory?

[09:51:23] <Spawns> dir-locals is annoying because it asks if its safe to load each time
[09:51:31] <Spawns> it works, but its annoying
[09:52:06] <Spawns> its also just something I am curious about, if it would be possible for this to be user defined or if it's too far into the emacs core

[09:52:48] <bpalmer> you can get what you want with, e.g., a global minor mode, or a function invoked via hooks
[09:53:14] <Spawns> what hook would be the best? I found find-files-hook, after-major-mode-change-hook

[09:53:53] <bpalmer> (i.e., if this were being added to core emacs, or a widespread package)
[09:54:46] <Spawns> right I understand that for sure. i am glad emacs asks for confirmation, otherwise it would be a massive security flaw, but it would be nice to be able to set some dir-locals manually from within init.el, which are safe since you control them
[09:55:00] <Spawns> you can actually do that, but it still asks for confirmation

[09:56:22] <bpalmer> perhaps you want to add a function to after-change-major-mode-hook which checks if the current buffer is visiting a file; if so, is it a path under that directory; if so , it sets a few variables or looks for a text file containing the variables to set.

[17:05:29] <empwilli> thblt: this can be easily explained with some fourth-wall-breaking: The Duke Nukem 3D engine is actually not able to have divable waterpools, which is why you are actually teleported between levels. This means you go into a pool 2nd floor, dive meta-water-level, resurface 1st floor. You see: No physics is broken :)

[19:10:33] * elph Hi everyone. I wanted to learn some elisp by creating a simple emacs UI. So for starters, reading an SQLite database and just list it on a buffer, each row per line with some basic UI functions like moving up, down and selecting. Can anyone recommend a really minimal example of this so I can study it? I could look at some already existing  projects sources (e.g. elfeed, ect), but I didn't want to chose a massive codebase or I 
[19:10:33] * elph could get lost XD.

[21:13:44] <mintsoup> I don't know if this is the right place to ask, but I'm using projectile and it creates double entries in cache for every file in the project. To be more precise, it will index every file and the "entries" will start with ./ (for example, main.c in the project root will look like "./main.c" in projectile-find-file completions), and whenever I open that file it will add a second entry, now without the ./ prefix. Does anyone know what
[21:13:44] <mintsoup> could be the reason for this?
