I tried to downgrade some packages to no avail, and I tried to create a new user and to log in there, to see if it was an issue with the user (it wasn't). Today, I ran pacman -Syu from chroot, and it looks like qt6-base was updated. Was this just a case where qt6-base was lagging behind the other packages, so things broke?

[03:03:42] <TheDcoder> I don't know why it keeps showing up, I don't like it, maybe it's a virus... looks like a worm to me
[03:04:03] <alad> TheDcoder: ~ does not bring me joy, so I tried deleting it
[03:04:07] <TheDcoder> Foxboron: Thanks for sharing the mail, that explains the up-tick I guess
[03:04:11] <thrice> Foxboron: meh, whatever you want.  If you want to classify "not working" differently than "broken" to feel better, that's fine
[03:04:17] <TheDcoder> alad: Make sure you rm -rf it

[03:05:53] <alad> happy and grateful people in #archlinux??? are you drunk or something
[03:06:11] <Foxboron> thrice: but when you need them they are great
[03:06:22] <Foxboron> I mostly just care about the graphs anyway
[03:06:24] <thrice> yes, the debug stuff is great :)
[03:06:35] <TheDcoder> Did we add a new debug repository with debug symbols for all packaged software!?
[03:06:45] <Foxboron> TheDcoder: almost there
[03:06:51] <TheDcoder> Cool
[03:07:01] <Foxboron> thrice: signing enclave POC in the works... git migration...
[03:07:08] <Foxboron> thrice: soon a lot of the pain is going away

[03:09:15] <TheDcoder> what, really?
[03:09:19] <Foxboron> But not everyone support source listing. Fedora and... maybe opensuse?
[03:09:43] <TheDcoder> Oh, right... I do recall some stuff about debuginfo packages in Fedora
[03:09:54] <alad> as far as I know fedora has the most complete debug package support
[03:10:45] <TheDcoder> Nice, I used Fedora before I switched to Arch, had to switch because of the slow package manager
[03:11:00] <Foxboron> alad: well, debugedit got split out of rpm which is why we can get better source listings in pacman
[03:11:10] <Foxboron> and we are the only package manager outside of the RPM ecosystem that has source listings
[03:11:14] <alad> nice

[05:27:21] <ds> heh, solved one part of the mystery at least. still no idea what caused the sudden errors and remount-ro
[05:27:33] <DeepDayze> check drive health?
[05:27:56] <ds> fsck fixed a bunch of things (mostly bits being wider than necessary) but whether those were related, anybody's guess
[05:28:18] <ds> DeepDayze: general drive health is good according to smart, it's doing an extended test atm to compare against numbers before
[05:28:31] <DeepDayze> okay good.
[05:28:33] <ds> fsck found no bad sectors either, super confusing
[05:29:21] <DeepDayze> your data still intact?
[05:30:33] <ds> afaik. it had a flurry of I/O errors when i was copying, but that was only in some vendor dirs of an ancient dropbox backup
[05:30:34] <DeepDayze> I sometimes force an fsck every so often to clean up any cruft in the filesystem and verify drive's health

[05:43:20] <ds> DeepDayze: i noticed fsck had options to mark/log bad sectors, but if it finds none i guess that's redundant
[05:43:44] <mpan> Be aware that if there are any bad sectors already detectable by OS, it means the drive has run out of sectors to reallocate. In other words: the drive is extremely deteriorated. It’s not the same as it was with HDDs 30 years ago.

[05:52:03] <kevr> one error = one error

[05:52:35] <demonicmaniac1> for example
[05:52:38] <kevr> It is vendor specific in practice, because there is no actual forced use of values that make sense to users
[05:52:44] <mpan> kevr: and what is “error”? And if it’s rate, is it cummulative over the entire driver’s period or a moving average? What kind of moving average?

[05:57:31] <kevr> i have a feeling that the reason that there's no effort given here is literally based on the fact that people normally have to hit up their vendor, especially when they're a company, to work out the issue
[05:57:41] <kevr> and so it's just forcibly backfeeding stuff to the vendor
[05:57:44] <kevr> more work to do

[06:00:33] <ds> maybe those temps were right D:
[06:00:51] <urawotlol> you might need some airflow around that drive
[06:00:58] <demonicmaniac1> 190 celsius airflow would toast pretty much everything in your system not just the drive
[06:01:23] <ds> 190? o.O
[06:01:33] <demonicmaniac1> wasn't there some mention of 190 earlier?
[06:01:57] <demonicmaniac1> 03:06 < kevr> take a look at the 190 Airflow_Temperature_Cel firmware entry
[06:02:08] <ds> ah 190 is ID# column
[06:02:17] <demonicmaniac1> ohhhh i see
[06:02:20] <ds> ;)
[06:02:25] <ds> 53 was the value, still toasty
[06:02:40] <urawotlol> ya need some airflow on that there drive
[06:02:56] <urawotlol> 53 sniffs like no airflow
[06:03:07] <ds> think ima scrap the plastic enclosure it came in too, there's no active cooling at all
[06:03:11] <demonicmaniac1> not just there though. a drive by itself doesn't really get that hot unless you have like 40 or 50 ambient. something is blowing much hot air about heating up everything
[06:03:14] <ds> heck not much in the way of passive room either

[06:03:34] <urawotlol> you do need airflow on a drive
[06:03:45] <urawotlol> especially if its a faster spindle
[06:04:08] <ds> would an extended smart test normally warm it up a fair bit?
[06:04:23] <urawotlol> not more than normal operation
[06:04:30] <ds> fair enough
[06:04:51] <ds> good chance something's not right then, ambient is only around 20~25
[06:05:02] <ds> i usually expect drives to go 30-40
[06:05:21] <urawotlol> and 50 in a closed box is easy
[06:05:44] <mpan> 40–45°C here, for comparison.
[06:05:44] <topcat001> 50+ is generally considered a bit too high for long periods; need more fans.
[06:06:18] <topcat001> The cooler you can get it to run the better.
[06:06:26] <ds> so it seems :) just wish I'd bothered to check smart on it before, the drive has to be blacklisted for uas for it to work
[06:06:30] <urawotlol> this is true
[06:06:57] <ds> had i ever got curious i could've blacklisted it years ago and had some context over time
[06:06:58] <demonicmaniac1> topcat001: not quite there's also a bottom limit and it's not condensation but much earlier
[06:07:03] <topcat001> I check smart often :)
[06:07:11] <mpan> I think there was some minor increase in mortality below 30°C too.
[06:07:16] <demonicmaniac1> mpan: yup
[06:07:21] <demonicmaniac1> and greatly below 20
[06:07:25] <topcat001> demonicmaniac1: Yes I did not mean freeze it :)
[06:07:38] <urawotlol> just colder than 50

[06:13:14] <ds> boy would i be tempted if i didn't need at least 4tb
[06:13:33] <topcat001> Although they have gotten much cheaper.
[06:13:38] <urawotlol> much
[06:13:49] <urawotlol> and you can get 100+ TB in a single drive
[06:13:57] <urawotlol> tho sata only not SAS or NVME
[06:14:02] <demonicmaniac1> not quite though. hdds powered on forever hardly wear out by writing unlike ssds
[06:14:13] <urawotlol> optane
[06:14:15] <demonicmaniac1> cost and wearing out is where hdds reign
[06:14:23] <topcat001> yeah
[06:14:25] <urawotlol> not for long
[06:14:36] <urawotlol> we just need optane or optane like stuff

[06:15:26] <urawotlol> ds: less material in a m.2
[06:15:36] <demonicmaniac1> ds: because they use no dram cache and only some slc caching and qlc
[06:15:42] <urawotlol> also sata to flash is expensive
[06:15:49] <demonicmaniac1> they're not cheaper than dramless sata qlc slc cache drives
[06:16:05] <demonicmaniac1> nvme doesn't mean it's fast or good :P
[06:16:13] <urawotlol> less overhead
[06:16:14] <ds> urawotlol: aye that makes sense, i remember them being 3 times the price tho heh
[06:16:23] <urawotlol> sure same spec?
[06:16:31] <urawotlol> that is alot larger 
[06:17:49] <demonicmaniac1> supercheap nvme ssds perform considerably worse than decent sata ssds so don't get fooled by just nvme in the description
[06:18:36] <kevr> some of them are just straight up misrepresented too, using the NVMe label when they're selling sata 3
[06:18:37] <urawotlol> *cough * dell *cough*
[06:19:01] <demonicmaniac1> lets not even get into the mess that is m.2 and eff them
[06:19:09] <DeepDayze> Dell does sell stuff that's kinda sus
[06:19:15] <demonicmaniac1> you can't even tell from looking at it nowadays if it's nvme or sata
[06:19:38] <demonicmaniac1> because there's no official standard for a/b/m key and whether it's sata or nvme and some vendors went out of their way to map it differently
[06:19:48] <demonicmaniac1> so you can only get one brand of ssd for it that has the "proper" mapping

[08:40:45] <norbert> Flagged it already. But I would also suggest that the default isntallation uses --no-debug-output in the .desktop file so that the journal not get swamped completely, and add another .desktop file rssguard-debug with the original behaviour. I have the PKGBUILD ready for both (update and that feature).

[17:57:55] <mpan> A quick question. Arch has no official [staging] repository, right?
[17:58:31] <jelle> mpan: [staging] is used for rebuilds so it is in a constant state of brokenness
[17:59:03] <mpan> I am asking, because a package in [community] depends on [staging].
[17:59:10] <Earnestly> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Official_repositories doesn't mention staging, but yes it sometimes exists

[20:31:05] <Warepire> palasso: I double checked the error codes, so something isn't awesome, but I don't think we're at "busted hardware" yet. Error 71 is "protocol error"

[21:06:18] <noze> What am I missing? Supposedly kde/plasma is very customisable, but I'm not sure to what extend the panel / launcher / systray etc are usable without kwin.

[21:08:11] <noze> before wayland, in the X world, one could combine say i3 with plasma and get a fully-fledged (as bloated wanted) desktop with a tiling window manager. with wayland it seems to go the outher way around: you can't rip the compositer out of the desktop, but you have to build the desktop services around the compositor.

[22:01:06] <taktaktak> the lightdm starts for example, i get a login screen
[22:01:06] <MrElendig> if you have no wm/de, then obviously it will fail to log in
