[01:23:23] <Crocodillian> given that everyone uses facebook and twitter which have no encryption all of this is pointless
[01:24:15] <Crocodillian> what would this affect exactly
[01:24:47] <Crocodillian> maybe signal
[01:24:52] <Crocodillian> but people could just use xmpp
[01:25:01] <Crocodillian> if they actually want encryption
[01:25:50] <Crocodillian> Hello, I'm the UPS Virtual Assistant. I see you tracked a package. Let me know how I can help.
[01:27:03] <Crocodillian> and there's no company behind xmpp so laws like this mean nothing
[01:27:17] <dukwon> germany is considering banning telegram
[01:27:32] <Crocodillian> that sounds rather extreme
[01:27:40] <Crocodillian> but then the US almost banned tiktok
[01:28:32] <Crocodillian> I think russia banned telegram for a while, maybe still do, and telegram was started by russians afaik
[01:29:46] <Crocodillian> I see it's not blocked anymore
[01:31:58] <Crocodillian> I doubt that will get passed
[01:32:20] <Crocodillian> that would piss off too many people
[01:32:57] <Crocodillian> this US law wouldn't affect telegram either since it has no operations in the US, as far as I can tell
[02:00:00] <T`aZ> if there is one thing i've learned since 2y
[02:00:13] <T`aZ> even if 90%of the people are pissed, they still wont say a thing
[02:00:18] <T`aZ> and comply
[02:02:18] <T`aZ> the worst part being that governments *now* knows this
[02:02:22] <T`aZ> -s
[02:20:01] <Crocodillian> it depends on what it is
[02:20:29] <Crocodillian> if it's getting an anal probe at the airport, they will happily comply, because fuck the terrorists, if you want to take away their tiktok they'll throw a fit
[02:23:41] <Crocodillian> freedom and democracy = hamburgers and fries and facebook
[02:26:23] <Crocodillian> "please fuck me in the ass harder, I love security!"
[02:27:34] <Crocodillian> most USians don't understand what a fascist shithole the US actually is

[11:41:27] <Faux> That SimCity interview comes to mind.
[11:42:01] <Faux> We were trying to simulate American cities but when we looked we realised American cities were actually just parking lots with the occasional building.

[16:42:28] <T`aZ> :D
[16:43:47] <dukwon> NFTs aren't even images
[16:44:02] <T`aZ> party pooper
[16:44:12] <dukwon> they're usually URLs of metadata files (hosted by the scammers) that in turn describe an image
[16:50:26] <Crocodillian> Renderwww: it was created by a couple of russians and is used by many russians, but is not hosted in russia at present for obvious reasons
[17:18:57] <Renderwww> basically all cryptography vendors are fronts for government agencies
[17:36:00] <Crocodillian> to some degree yes
[17:41:50] <Crocodillian> telegram is not controlled by any russian agency but they do use it
[17:57:07] <Renderwww> that's what they want you to believe!
[18:07:29] <Crocodillian> maybe, but it was not made by pro-government russians
[18:07:44] <Crocodillian> and they tried to ban it
[18:13:28] <Renderwww> they are going after Faux https://i.4cdn.org/g/1644309026097.jpg
[18:16:14] <T`aZ> think of the children !
[18:16:15] <T`aZ> wai
[18:16:16] <T`aZ> t
[18:17:13] <Crocodillian> kids stupid enough to not be able to get around such restrictions shouldn't be looking at those sites anyway
[18:17:54] <Crocodillian> that is like, easy enough for a 5 year old
[18:19:49] <Crocodillian> so I am completely in favor of this
[18:23:56] <T`aZ> lol
[18:24:40] <Crocodillian> we need to train kids how to navigate the real world and how to use the methods required for that
[18:32:17] <Crocodillian> I mean you do not get boobies with no effort in real life either
[18:39:17] <T`aZ> as if kids watchibng porn is the issue here
[18:39:41] <T`aZ> next they will mandate tht you identify yourself for everything
[18:39:44] <T`aZ> even searches
[18:39:55] <T`aZ> 'what do you mean i cannot search this topic on google?'
[18:40:03] <T`aZ> welcomem to the future
[18:40:43] <T`aZ> it always starts with bashing the criminals, or having 'for the children' excuses, then it's too late, and your liberty is gone
[18:41:18] <T`aZ> but yeah, sure, kids will find a way, so no real issue after all Ã¨
[18:41:25] <T`aZ> !*
[18:41:25] <nolyc> T`aZ: Error: "*" is not a valid command.
[18:41:31] <T`aZ> lol
[18:43:16] <Crocodillian> T`aZ: 99% of people are already identified for searches, they are logged in to their google account or their ms account for bing etc.
[18:44:00] <Crocodillian> or their yandex account or whatever
[18:44:29] <Crocodillian> it's barely anyone who uses tor browser or whatever for this
[18:44:46] <Crocodillian> I mean of course I understand what you're saying
[18:46:21] <Crocodillian> google searches are GET requests still too, even if they are oevr SSL, so you understand what that means
[18:47:48] <Crocodillian> even if they're not logged in to their google account it hardly matters
[18:48:35] <Crocodillian> you idiots are titlting at windmills trying to protect your "freedom" you've never had
[18:51:14] <Renderwww> wake up sheeple!
[18:51:38] <T`aZ> it matters a lot
[18:52:13] <Renderwww> the trick is to live in a log cabin in the woods and send out self made presents via mail
[18:52:24] <Renderwww> they have a hard time getting to you
[18:52:32] <T`aZ> just because you think you are not impacted doesn't mean you'll never be impacted
[18:53:13] <Crocodillian> Renderwww: they do not have a hard time getting to you, they might just need to use you for their political purposes
[18:53:18] <T`aZ> but then it will already be too late since a long time ago so
[18:53:34] <Crocodillian> yes that's what I meant
[18:53:40] <T`aZ> you can all go die in a fire, please
[18:53:48] <Renderwww> took them some time to get uncle Ted when he was running that scheme. But that was mostly pre internet
[18:53:54] <Crocodillian> yes that is my actual political affiliation
[18:59:35] <Crocodillian> T`aZ: have you thought about what actually matters to you practically, this world will die, there is nothing anyone can do about that
[19:01:31] <Renderwww> heat death of the universe soon, why even bother with anything!
[19:01:38] <T`aZ> im taking the egoistical route for most things too
[19:02:03] <T`aZ> Renderwww: i got severly depressed when i learned about entropy :s
[19:02:43] <Crocodillian> did you know that economic growth produces entropy bringing us closer to the death of the universe
[19:02:59] <Crocodillian> but anyway, that's not what I'm talking about
[19:11:01] <Crocodillian> T`aZ: ideals and ideology are different things, if you are interested in the former you have to be practical and accept reality in order to be effective
[19:20:14] <Crocodillian> T`aZ: sometimes you will have to accept that your cynicism comes from reason and not just fear and despair
[19:24:38] <T`aZ> people not giving a fuck depresses me more than the tyrants being tyrants
[19:25:10] <T`aZ> but as i said, iim becoming more practical, and jalso, not giving a fuck of others now
[19:25:22] <T`aZ> also*
[19:27:19] <T`aZ> dont count on me trying to defend your idea if i dont share it, you can be censored, i dont care
[19:27:36] <T`aZ> you asked for censorship in the first place, so you got what you deserve
[19:28:25] <Crocodillian> what does "censorship" mean to you, what problem do you want to help solve, how can you practically help solve it
[19:29:20] <Crocodillian> my position is not apathy, I do not have a side, I do not want to convince people of anything, most people are worthless garbage and I could give a shit what they feel or believe about anything
[19:32:46] <hinst> I disapprove censorship. I frown upon censorship
