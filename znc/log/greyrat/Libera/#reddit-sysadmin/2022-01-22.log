[01:21:33] <cryptic1> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, Log4j, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, Log Forge. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning Log Forge system made useful by the Log Forge corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
[01:21:38] <cryptic1> Many computer users run a modified version of the Log Forge system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of Log Forge which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the Log Forge system, developed by the Log4j Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.
[01:21:43] <cryptic1> Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the Log Forge operating system: the whole system is basically Log Forge with Linux added, or Log Forge/Linux. All th
[01:21:48] <cryptic1> e so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of Log Forge/Linux

[03:20:59] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> how do I use PHP to accomplish this?
[03:21:22] <Admiral_Nines> start with pulling your data from sql into an array in php
[03:21:46] <Admiral_Nines> https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_mysql_select.asp

[03:22:31] <Admiral_Nines> As soon as you do that, take your array and use `print_r(jsonencode($query));`
[03:22:39] <Admiral_Nines> now you've got a page that turns your mysql data into JSON code.
[03:23:01] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> Admiral_Nines: essentially the user needs to type their name into a text box to get an ID nu,ber

[04:02:53] <shibboleth> first spdy, now quic. apparent what the devs thought of plain ol' http
[04:03:46] <signofzeta> HTTP/2 was a speed improvement (compressed headers much?), and HTTP/3 brought the whole shebang over to UDP 443.

[04:05:23] <signofzeta> <source srcset="surprised pikachu face.png">
[04:06:01] <signofzeta> honestly, I don't know.  there were four RFCs.  QUIC is one, HTTP/3 is another, I didn't bother checking the others but all I know is that "IT'S OVER RFC 9000!"

[04:48:38] <signofzeta> no, one grandparent emigrated from China.  The other had a long-standing French-Canadian/Irish ancestry by way of Cape Cod.
[04:48:53] <Admiral_Nines> I think chinese are a little prettier in general than the others, followed by japan
[04:49:23] <shibboleth> nah? han-chinese?
[04:50:43] <shibboleth> vietnam and korea were the awkward ones, third chicks family were deep in the oil industry, third gen
[04:50:50] <shibboleth> indonesia
[04:51:54] <shibboleth> nah, malaysia
[04:51:56] <shibboleth> my bad
[04:53:30] <Admiral_Nines> Huh, now i'm in a rabbit hole. I never noticed how goergous Uyghur actresses are
[04:53:42] <Admiral_Nines> https://www.google.com/search?q=uyghur+actresses&client=opera-gx&hs=ocT&hl=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjHy-GXmcT1AhW-IDQIHbEDBu0Q_AUoAnoECAEQBA&biw=1817&bih=979&dpr=1
[04:54:14] <signofzeta> Chinese Muslims.  (my heritage-in-law is exactly 0% Uyghur, fyi)
[04:54:35] <shibboleth> well, must be better than han-chinese by default. they mostly look like... ugly white ppl if you ask me
[04:54:46] <Admiral_Nines> who, han-chinese?
[04:55:19] <signofzeta> I will say I have a thing for Constantinople
[04:55:30] <shibboleth> well, yeah.
[04:55:34] <shibboleth> turks?
[04:55:58] <Admiral_Nines> can't blame you there
[04:56:08] <shibboleth> turks?
[04:56:12] <Admiral_Nines> I do really love dark hair and light skin. 
[04:56:23] <signofzeta> they're why Constantinople got the works
[04:56:53] <Admiral_Nines> through my cursory non-official google research it appears that northern chinese have a wider chin then southern chinese. This results in more handsome men for nothern china, but more pretty women in southern china.
[04:57:27] <Admiral_Nines> you keep saying constantinople... but tha'ts not a place anymore....
[04:57:40] <shibboleth> former name of istanbul
[04:57:52] <Admiral_Nines> yeah, there's a song about that.
[04:58:52] <Admiral_Nines> https://youtu.be/xo0X77OBJUg
[04:59:40] <shibboleth> also didn't help that i was at least two feet taller than the dads in question
[05:00:46] <Admiral_Nines> https://youtu.be/Wcze7EGorOk this ones better. it's the original
[05:01:36] <shibboleth> well, it was called constantinople looong before there were "songs about it""
[05:01:56] <Admiral_Nines> it was also renamed to istanbul long before there were songs about it
[05:02:23] <Admiral_Nines> it hasn't been constantinople in a hundred years.
[05:02:32] <shibboleth> nah, they had record-players as early as 1910s :P
[05:02:46] <shibboleth> gramophones
[05:02:55] <xe0n> saxxxaaammoooppohhhhhonnneee
[05:03:01] <Admiral_Nines> would be pretty wierd if they wrote a song about the name change before the name change happened
[05:03:42] <Admiral_Nines> but then, you must be an old soul with a name like shibboleth
[05:03:49] <shibboleth> yeah, what i'm alluding to is that the song is unlikely to be great art :)
[05:04:55] <Admiral_Nines> at least you aren't named sibboleth.
[05:05:00] <Admiral_Nines> then you'd be dead.
[05:05:20] <shibboleth> yeah, then lord tywin would've carried me out into the sea
[05:06:08] <Admiral_Nines> ooohhh, is it a game of thrones reference? I haven't seen that.
[05:06:16] <Admiral_Nines> did they use shibboleth in GoT?
[05:07:10] <shibboleth> well, where i grew up you were expected to have mastered the ancient art of reading/writing and the ancient art of spelling at day 1 at school
[05:08:21] <shibboleth> hmmm... superfluous "the ancient art of..." there, my bad
[05:11:19] <Admiral_Nines> anybody ever used meshcentral?
[05:11:30] <shibboleth> hell, i remember using teletext to show the teacher that it would rain dogs and cats during a planned excursion in first grade
[05:12:52] <shibboleth> and i totally didn't get the wUUUT-reaction that came of that
[05:13:47] <shibboleth> i had been using teletext to find out when movies were gonna air, parents never bothered with a tv-guide

[07:12:38] *** Joins: thegrif (~thegrif@pool-71-187-252-20.nwrknj.fios.verizon.net)
[07:13:17] <misspwn> i was scared like what if something happens and i dont get the job for real. but then i realized i signed a contract and then it felt real getting the tracking from IT
[07:13:19] <mistiry> i would recommend a standing desk and a really good chair
[07:13:34] *** Quits: thegrif (~thegrif@pool-71-187-252-20.nwrknj.fios.verizon.net) (Client Quit)
[07:13:42] <misspwn> so i actually got two cabinets from ikea and a kitchen counter block from there to make a desk. its the perfect height for me
[07:13:47] <mistiry> misspwn: yeah its so nice when it finally feels real. big weight off your chest.
[07:13:52] <xe0n> standing desk +++
[07:14:12] <misspwn> tbh i never used my standing desk at work we'll see how this works for now
[07:14:20] <mistiry> i got my desk for sub-300, but i didnt have one for a long time so i get it
[07:14:37] <mistiry> its nice when i'm hitting that afternoon lull
[07:14:53] <Kiernian> I've never liked standing desks. I think I spent too much time on my feet in my youth
[07:14:55] <mistiry> stand up, move around, etc. while on a meeting
[07:14:57] <misspwn> i'm pretty short so a lot of desks are either too short or really high up and then my feet don't hit the ground. these cabinets i think get it to 29" tall
[07:15:06] <misspwn> but i should have enough room to move around and stretch
[07:15:06] <Kiernian> oh, I always walk/pace/etc when in meetings.
[07:15:07] <DrGibby> I gotta get around to making a desk
[07:15:10] <signofzeta> good to hear, misspwn! I don't get unlimited PTO -- it's based per-hour -- but I'm getting 8 hours added for working Presidents' Day.
[07:15:14] <mistiry> misspwn: mine adjust from 27" to i think 45"
[07:15:25] <DrGibby> though, if I'm going to buy a house, might be a good idea to wait until the new space 
[07:16:04] <signofzeta> DrGibby: I fear the day I need to have movers move this L-shaped desk.  sure, I can unscrew it, but I still fear them.
[07:16:09] <misspwn> you peeps were the best though of all the times i was bitching about the toxicity
[07:16:13] <mistiry> aeron chairs are the bees knees, but $$$$. recommend if you can find one used that's affordable
[07:16:17] <misspwn> so thanks for giving me support on that
[07:16:31] <mistiry> everyone's gotta be able to bitch from time to time
[07:16:34] <signofzeta> misspwn: oh the bitching we could bitch together. sorry I missed it.
[07:16:41] <mistiry> we have meetings at work solely for that purpose
[07:16:44] <DrGibby> signofzeta: yeah, understood-- when I guild my next desk idk how I'll move it because its going to be heavy, and difficult 
[07:17:03] <DrGibby> +1 on the aeron chairs btw
[07:17:26] <DrGibby> with rollerblade wheels
[07:17:32] <DrGibby> life changing 
[07:17:49] <signofzeta> it's a $2.5K desk but it came with a 15-year warranty. I just have to get it out of this apartment and into my forever house -- whenever that is.
[07:17:53] <mistiry> i need to do the wheels on mine
[07:18:05] <DrGibby> its awesome 
[07:18:21] <DrGibby> I roll around like effortlessly 
[07:18:33] <DrGibby> and its smoooooooth
[07:18:35] <signofzeta> If anyone wants an UPLIFT Desk coupon code, I'm a consumer whore, PM me.  I got the soft-roll casters on it and my chair.

[07:23:56] <akccc> yo
[07:24:03] <mistiry> yo
[07:24:32] <akccc> how bad of a idea is it to change industries but stay as a sysadmin
[07:24:48] <cryptic1> industry never matters
[07:24:50] <misspwn> i made a take on minnesotan juicy lucy burgers: used impossible ground(been trying to sub it for most beef lately)https://imgur.com/a/ZuI84zZ
[07:24:51] <mistiry> industry doesnt matter
[07:24:56] <misspwn> they turned out pretty phenomenal
[07:24:59] <mistiry> find the best job you can and go
[07:25:01] <akccc> what about if its finance and you live in a high col financial center
[07:25:02] <akccc> lol
[07:25:12] <cryptic1> who cares
[07:25:16] <cryptic1> if new job pays well
[07:25:26] <cryptic1> job is job
[07:25:30] <akccc> ya im just waiting on job offer from new job, but its a small biotech company
[07:25:37] <akccc> so i dont think it'll pay as well, but it'll be full wfh at least
[07:25:39] <cryptic1> careful with startups
[07:25:40] <mistiry> good pay? good bennies? the hours you're looking for? thats the kind of stuff that matters
[07:25:43] <cryptic1> loooooong hours
[07:25:46] <cryptic1> looooow pay
[07:25:58] <akccc> i dont think its a startup since its on nasdaq
[07:26:00] <misspwn> akccc, i actually took a cut in pay for a variety of reasons, one of them being wfh
[07:26:10] <akccc> yeah i guess the biggest thing i'd miss from finance is
[07:26:12] <akccc> the big bonuses
[07:26:13] <misspwn> in the end i'm making the same for less travel
[07:26:33] <akccc> its not full wfh but its 95% wfh
[07:26:41] <akccc> i think its worth cause it'd let me move out ofthe city
[07:27:00] <akccc> i guess i should just wait for the actual offer tho lol
[07:27:19] <akccc> my references told me they talked to him for like 20-30 min  which sounded crazy
[07:27:27] <akccc> cause i thought most places dont even call references
[07:27:37] <misspwn> oh wow, i didn't even get asked
[07:27:59] <akccc> yeah i thought i was like wtf lol
[07:28:03] <mistiry> yeah i had to give references for this job too
[07:28:11] <mistiry> first time they actually called people lol
[07:28:14] <mistiry> but it wasnt a concern
[07:28:17] <akccc> references are bs anyway
[07:28:22] <mistiry> yeppp
[07:28:27] <misspwn> nah in most cases it wouldn't be if you aren't trash
[07:28:28] <akccc> you wouldnt list someone unless they had something good to say lol
[07:28:57] <akccc> only impression i got from the interview is
[07:28:57] <PrincessZoey> whee, my quarter-assed english paper is submitted.
[07:29:00] <PrincessZoey> I'm fuckin tired.
[07:29:04] <akccc> scientists and phd people are terrible users
[07:29:16] <misspwn> haha they can be yeah
[07:29:32] <akccc> at my current finance comp most ppl are pretty good
[07:29:43] <akccc> only 1 or 2 is kinda technically illiterate and even then their nice ppl so its whatever
[07:30:03] <misspwn> i had a data analyst keep opening tickets because the mouse wouldn't work. she was plugging it in between the dock and laptop. it happens more than you think
[07:30:24] <misspwn> but if that's the worst type of end user support, i'd take it
[07:30:26] <akccc> i had a tech lead for a development team put in a ticket saying her keyboard isnt working
[07:30:31] <akccc> she had one of those flat mac keyboards
[07:30:38] <akccc> her phone was on top of the corner key
[07:31:12] <Kiernian> corded, mechanical, full-height keyboards for everyone! Never have that problem again :P
[07:31:17] <akccc> but yeah im just hoping this new job pays well lol
[07:31:24] <akccc> they asked me like 3 times about salary expectations
[07:31:30] <akccc> and i just said "oh im just looking for market rate"
[07:31:44] <xe0n> "more than i'm earning now"
[07:31:57] <akccc> im thinking
[07:31:59] <akccc> if the offer is good
[07:32:04] <akccc> wait till i get bonuses at my current place then dip
[07:32:22] <akccc> well put in 2 weeks after the cash hits my bank
[07:32:23] <misspwn> make sure there isn't anything weird in your contract about bonuses being paid out
[07:32:41] <akccc> ya true i gotta reread it lol
[07:33:23] <misspwn> somewhat familiar with the base+ bonus and that bonus is taxable income and there might not be a stipulation on that
[07:35:23] <PrincessZoey> alright, it's 10:04pm, I figure my monitor ain't showing up today
[07:35:42] <akccc> yeah honestly i think the only thing ill lose is
[07:35:44] <akccc> my unvested stuff
[07:35:49] <akccc> gonna exercise all my options
[07:36:58] <misspwn> and if you can afford it, try to get a week off before the new one starts. it's going to be tight for me given i had to pay for daycare twice to quarantine and with unpaid leave. but i gota get a break between
[07:37:13] <misspwn> er pay for daycare even though we were all at home. it sucks
[07:37:53] <akccc> damn
[07:38:06] <akccc> honestly im going to see if i can get like a 
[07:38:09] <akccc> 1 month start date
[07:38:56] <A-KO> I'm with misspwn on taking a break
[07:39:04] <A-KO> take a mini vacay somewhere or something if you can

[08:04:59] <monr0e> I have a thick-headed question. What have I done wrong in setting up my domain? When I sign in to IRC, the server recognises my hostname as either mail.vixen.international, or smtp.vixen.international. What have I done wrong?

[08:07:19] <DrGibby> nope!
[08:07:31] <monr0e> xe0n: No, I mean as in, my hostname should ideally be vixen.international. Instead it seems to see only my email server
[08:07:58] <xe0n> or how about you just cloak yourself?
[08:09:32] <monr0e> My point is, that hostname might be a problem in other scenarios, no? I'm not that fussed about a cloak, this is a work address and we operate an IRC room of our own where I need to be identified as an official 
[08:10:30] <xe0n> stop running irc off your mail server that probably has a ptr record to that domain :P
[08:10:32] <xe0n> LOL
[08:11:15] <monr0e> grumble grumble. Is it that simple? We have one public facing IP at the moment. Small business woes
[08:11:19] <mistiry> monr0e: yeah its a DNS thing
[08:11:38] <monr0e> So a mail server takes priority on a DNS record. TIL
[08:11:39] <mistiry> in fact, you came in as both smtp. and mail. 
[08:12:27] <technonerd> something flip it and reverse it
[08:12:57] <monr0e> yep. That's a little frustrating. I suspect maybe its just a race condition between the send/receive side of our infra? Thats a guess tbh
[08:13:17] <monr0e> technonerd ok missy elliot :D
[08:13:23] <xe0n> orrrrr its dns and you've got two PTR records to smtp. and mail.
[08:13:35] <xe0n> same ip
