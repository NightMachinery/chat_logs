[00:21:23] <blez> is there AOT for .NET 5?
[00:25:11] <irwiss> sorta, there's r2r images you can do
[00:25:48] <pazof> I thought AOT only had a meaning using mono

[00:27:02] <irwiss> depends what aot you need, r2r is cutting down on startup time, if you need "on paper" aot like for ios publishing then yeah, mono has it iirc

[12:47:50] <planetcall|work> bomb, neeva seems to be open for public in general with a subscription. It is not a B2B solution. I somehow like the idea in the same way I like the concept of paid privacy oriented emails.
[12:48:44] <planetcall|work> it is just hard to justify the model considering good free privacy focused alternatives which are sustaining somehow
[12:51:53] <bomb> planetcall|work privacy these days kinda relies on leaving no fingerprint, right? how it's gonna work if I'm using an app as a paid user?
[12:55:22] <planetcall|work> Some services allow you to pay using crypto to abstract your identity. Neeva seems to provide integration with your GSuite, Office 365 etc so they must have some information about you stored. However, privacy is subjective
[12:55:42] <planetcall|work> I think what they imply is that they don't monetize your data. They rely on the subscription to sustain.
[12:56:25] <planetcall|work> They have some policy regarding data retention if you want to read. Once again, I am not using it as it is not available in europe yet. https://neeva.com/privacy

[13:20:44] <alguien> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-5.0/breaking-changes#collection-distinct-groupby says that a "correlated collection followed by a" Distinct or/GroupBy is a no-no because if Distinct/GroupBy included the parent id (I assume that's what "entity's primary key" means) might change the result of Distinct/GroupBy. But doesn't "correlated" necessarily mean tied to the parent, and therefor its id? So why would it be a problem to

[14:51:59] <Tobbi_> If I declare stuff inside a foreach that could as well be declared in the outer scope because it stays the same all the time, the compiler is not smart enough to detect that, right?
[14:52:33] <jonp> why's it matter?
[14:53:10] <Tobbi_> I'm just wondering...
[14:53:31] <Tobbi_> Because the calls I just moved outside my foreach were comparatively heavy...
[14:55:06] <jonp> generally speaking, the compiler will NOT look at a member body to see if the return value "stays the same all the time", and inline/reorder accordingly
[14:55:13] <jonp> that's on you
[14:55:16] <Tobbi_> Alright.
[14:55:24] <Tobbi_> Thanks.
[14:59:42] <MizMahem> what are you declaring inside a foreach? I'm confused. The pattern is basically `foreach(itemAnEnumeratorReturns in thingThatImplementsGetEnumerator)`
[15:00:06] <MizMahem> As `GetEnumerator()` is only going to be called once, I'm not really sure what kind of calculations you could call here.
[15:00:09] <jonp> MizMahem: foreach (…) { var foo = ExpensiveOperation(); }
[15:00:14] <Tobbi_> Yes.
[15:00:19] <jonp> and if ExpensiveOperation() returns the same thing each time…
[15:00:30] <MizMahem> oh, inside the scope of the foreach, I get you.
[15:00:47] <Tobbi_> Expensive Operation == Fetching static data from the database.
[15:00:52] <Tobbi_> But yeah, I reduced the scope now.
[15:01:24] <MizMahem> yeah I don't even know how it could make that kind of determination, since the compiler has no way of knowing that that a function return is guaranteed to be the same.
[15:01:26] *** Quits: alguien (~alguien@user/alguien) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[15:01:53] <Tobbi_> Maybe if the parameters to that function call are? but then again, the function could be modifying its own state.
[15:01:58] <jonp> if C# had a concept of "pure" methods, it could plausibly reason about it
[15:02:05] <MizMahem> but it doesn't :p
[15:02:13] <jonp> but it doesn't, and even if it did, you're talking about a DB here
[15:02:15] <Tobbi_> pure method == something that would be marked const in c++ ?
[15:02:17] <jonp> "pure" wouldn't apply
[15:02:20] <jonp> Tobbi_: no
[15:02:27] <jonp> kinda, but no
[15:02:34] <Tobbi_> :D
[15:02:36] <jonp> "pure" means "always returns the same outputs given the same inputs"
[15:02:51] <Tobbi_> right.
[15:02:58] <jonp> a C++ const method could use `random()` and do whatever it wants
[15:03:05] <Tobbi_> you're right
[15:03:05] <jonp> `const` just means "won't modify instance state"
[15:03:12] <jonp> and even then… it can modify instance state ;-)

[15:03:33] <Tobbi_> kay, I'm getting Vietnam flashbacks.
[15:03:34] <Tobbi_> Stop that.
[15:04:51] <jonp> "pure" is a concept that "sounds" nice, but i don't see how it's workable, at least not for me.
[15:04:59] <jonp> not for my "printf-debugging" style
[15:05:15] <jonp> unless Console.WriteLine() is "pure", but what would that even *mean*? non-sensical.
[15:05:59] <MizMahem> mmm, well it's nice if you are say pulling out pieces of functions to compartmentalize. Such methods could often be static and pure.
[15:08:11] <MizMahem> the thing I most often finding myself wanting at the current moment is the ability to do the various other jump statements (return, continue, break) from inside an expression.
[15:08:35] <MizMahem> there's an issue for that, but it doesn't appear to be near to getting in.

[20:08:29] <gufi> this is all just to do stuff on my car lol
[20:08:56] <gufi> yesterday i welded up my clutch  pedal assembly, couple days back i patched up some intake pipes

[20:16:37] <DevJohnC> brianonymous, tuples are value types

[20:17:38] <DevJohnC> brianonymous, so long as we're talking about (tuple, syntax) and not Tuple<T..Tn>
[20:18:02] <brianonymous> i was thinking Tuple<>
[20:18:13] <DevJohnC> oh don't use that
[20:18:16] <gufi> i wonder if i could take both my compressors tie them together
[20:18:34] <Nasp> I hate how air compressors are always so noisy
[20:18:44] <gufi> my current one is 60 db

[20:19:03] <gufi> the one i posted would not be
[20:19:06] <DevJohnC> brianonymous, so Tuple<> is a class, I'm unsure how it functions in a dictionary
[20:19:08] <Nasp> Usually sounds like a jetengine
[20:20:10] <brianonymous> DevJohnC: my gut feels like what im attempting is bad juju anyways. gonna re-eval
[20:20:41] <redoc> Anyone been able to get their Windows Subsystem for Android to show up in VS as a device?
[20:20:42] <DevJohnC> brianonymous, if you can avoid using Tuple<>, the tuple syntax introduced a value tuple type that it uses under the hood that's far better
[20:21:09] <Lukky> gufi: I don't see why you couldn't... unless one is good for twice the pressure of the other... make sure never to go above the lowest rating...
[20:21:44] <Lukky> gufi: grab a metal tank, some fittings, voila!
[20:21:54] <gufi> yea both would be iron tanks good to around 200 psi... i can store them both in the shed if i just run some pipe to the garage from there
[20:22:39] <Lukky> The issue is often capacity, not pressure (I mean your needs)... make sure you have a large reservoir...
[20:24:01] <gufi> painting, cabinet, are probably gonna be the highest requirement for flow i need

[20:49:51] <Slade> gufi, safety and navy arent generally compatible concepts.  isnt the leading cause of death there still electrocution?
[20:50:19] <gufi> yes, but electrocution is 99/100 times user error
[20:50:43] <gufi> improper tagout/ignoring guidlines etc is normally the case rather than "shit went wrong"
[20:51:08] <Slade> user error of the dead person. or predecesors for mislabeling etc
[20:52:30] <gufi> user error of the dead person is normally the problem honestly
[20:52:47] <Slade> fair enough
[20:53:21] <gufi> we had a dude on our boat get fried by 440 3phase, he only tagged out half the system
[20:53:46] <gufi> left the backup active, step 1 before touching a "potentially active system": TEST FOR VOLTAGE
[20:53:49] <gufi> he ignored that too
[20:54:25] <gufi> biggest reason for that is because just becuase you tagged it out doesnt mean some super cap isnt holding 10000volts

[21:32:25] <lz__> slowly
[21:32:59] <Nasp> Makes perfect sense
[21:33:30] <lz__> not rly
[21:33:49] <Nasp> That is how most time corrections are done these days
[21:33:57] <Nasp> I just didnt know it was the default in windows
[21:34:19] <Nasp> You dont want systems to just suddently skip a few seconds or go back in time
[21:34:47] <lz__> I don't want them to fast forward/backward in time either :D
[21:35:03] <lz__> a single jump makes less mess imo, if there are operations in progress
[21:35:18] <Nasp> A single jump can cost million of dollars
[21:36:20] <lz__> you're right that "slowing time" can prevent a jump backwards

[21:39:36] <lz__> damn you were right :)
[21:41:29] <Nasp> Yeah just search for phase offset
[21:41:36] <lz__> only does it for small time differences, they give an example of 4 and 3mins
[21:43:02] <lz__> also isn't this a windows server thing only?
[21:43:15] <Nasp> Run "w32tm /query /status /verbose" to see how your times synced
[21:43:26] <Nasp> Yes that's what the max offset is for
[21:43:37] <Nasp> Makes sense if the time is completely off
[21:43:42] <Nasp> Else it would never be able to catch up
[21:44:02] <Nasp> But i couldnt figure out why it wouldn't sync time more precise and was wondering why it was off
[21:44:18] <lz__> "The following error occurred: The service has not been started. (0x80070426)" :D
[21:44:20] <Nasp> So i set the time to purposely be 30 minutes behind and then did a sync, and then it dud the jump

[22:27:23] * gufi assumes this person is coming from C++
[22:27:36] <jonp> then they should use std::vector<T> ;-)
[22:27:36] <Seng> I am a C# kinda guy :)
[22:27:43] <_Shurik_> Seng: one exists, another - doesn't
[22:27:49] <Lukky> I'm looking into using csly (https://github.com/b3b00/csly)... any words of wisdom?
[22:27:56] <jonp> Seng: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics.vector-1?view=net-5.0 ?
[22:28:09] <Seng> Would normally use a List<T>, but the Bond-language has it's own types.
[22:28:16] <Seng> And it's horribly documented :))
[22:28:17] <jonp> "Bond-language"?
[22:28:27] <Seng> https://github.com/microsoft/bond
[22:28:35] <Seng> Protobufs, but worse :)
[22:29:01] <Seng> to be fair, I don't know if it's worse. I just can't find any good documentation.
[22:29:28] <jonp> so: https://microsoft.github.io/bond/manual/bond_cs.html
[22:29:38] <jonp> which has `vector<double> Constants`
[22:29:48] <_Shurik_> If you wondering between List<T> and anything else - you need List<T>
[22:30:40] <_Shurik_> just sayn'
[22:30:57] <Seng> I just realized I could try defining to fields and compile it.
[22:31:20] <Seng> a list<T> in Bond is a LinkedList<T> in C#, and a vector<T> in Bond is a List<T> in C#.

[23:22:43] <gufi> i do until a point and then i get jittery but i'd have to drink 2-3 20oz redbulls to get there
[23:22:48] <_Shurik_> How do you call bananas? Here, have some yellow penis shaped fruits?
[23:23:40] <Diablo-D3> 2-3 20oz is less than 400mg.
[23:24:04] <bomb> _Shurik_ "time to eat some baby arms"
[23:24:26] <gufi> 2 20 oz would be around 300
[23:24:39] *** Quits: Assault (~Assault@87-95-123-155.bb.dnainternet.fi) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[23:24:58] <Diablo-D3> so I looked it up, its 114mg per 20oz
[23:25:12] <Diablo-D3> so 3 is 342mg
[23:25:41] <Diablo-D3> if you do this with no caffeine tolerance, and it doesn't put you on the ceiling, this can be used as a criteria to diagnose adhd
[23:25:51] <bomb> why don't you just use mg for everything, lol. who came up with "oz"
[23:26:07] <Diablo-D3> bomb: no, it'd be ml
[23:26:56] <bomb> bargain double-barrel sawn-off shotguns for sale. PM for details!
[23:26:59] <gufi> not sure where you looked up how much caffien is in redbull btw =)
[23:27:19] <Diablo-D3> redbull's website.

[23:28:44] <gufi> 3 16 oz cans would be 456 mg of caffein =D
[23:29:39] <Diablo-D3> interesting, thats not the same page I saw
[23:29:58] <gufi> possibly different depending on where you are?
[23:30:04] <gufi> that is the US page lol
[23:30:15] <bomb> one of you guys isn't American
[23:30:27] * gufi is 'merkan
[23:30:50] * Diablo-D3 is american
[23:31:02] <gufi> whale shit
[23:31:04] <gufi> i dunno then lol
[23:31:23] <bomb> what are your skin colors? (in RGBA)
[23:31:30] * _Shurik_ is American
[23:31:37] * gufi is pasty ass white dude from the south
[23:31:47] <Diablo-D3> I think I went to an older page on their website, wasnt flashy like that one
[23:31:47] <gufi> _Shurik_,  can confirm
[23:31:54] <_Shurik_> true dat
[23:32:19] <gufi> now i want a redbull =(

[23:32:43] <gufi> i wish there was a lower caffien version of it though when i gank some of the wifes adderal, cannot drink coffee/energy drinks when i take that shit
[23:32:46] <sonny> can StreamReader objects be passed around?
[23:32:53] <Diablo-D3> so yeah, 80 / 8.46 * 60 = 567
[23:33:01] <Diablo-D3> gufi: whats weird is, they used to *not* put this much in
[23:33:11] <Diablo-D3> other than them tasting like shit, its why I never bought them
[23:33:20] <gufi> oh i love the way they taste lol
[23:33:24] <gufi> especially the peach version
[23:33:30] <Diablo-D3> they're still stingy though, 20oz is still only 189mg
[23:33:48] <bomb> > One 250-ml can of Red Bull Energy Drink contains 80 mg of caffeine.
[23:33:54] <bomb> on the brit page
[23:33:56] <gufi> if i could have a version that had coca cola levels i'd be happy
[23:34:02] <Diablo-D3> bomb: yeah, they're 250ml in the US too, thats 8.46 oz
[23:35:06] <bomb> does caffeine really help attention, though?
[23:35:16] <gufi> does for me
[23:35:32] <gufi> shit goes clear for a while then the crash  happens
[23:35:46] <bomb> crash? can you describe it thoroughly?
[23:35:57] <bomb> does it make you punch the walls and kick the cat?
[23:35:57] <Diablo-D3> but like, if its 151mg per 16oz, rockstar, bang, reign, etc, are all 240 or 300 per 16oz
[23:36:13] <Diablo-D3> bomb: no, like diabetic coma crash
[23:36:23] <Diablo-D3> but its because of the sugar, gufi wouldnt experience that if he drank sugar free
[23:36:24] <gufi> ^
[23:36:35] <Diablo-D3> thats *also* another sign of adhd
[23:36:35] <bomb> oh he drinks redbull right
[23:36:37] <gufi> yea but the sugar free versions are fuckin nasty
[23:36:53] <Diablo-D3> if you eat a lot of sugar, and then you immediately crash later, you might have adhd
[23:36:56] <bomb> you might end up with an heart attack
[23:37:03] <Diablo-D3> gufi: the sugar is literally killing you though
[23:37:05] <Diablo-D3> bomb: yes/no
[23:37:12] <Diablo-D3> the stimulant adhd drunks might also give you a heart attack
[23:37:14] <Diablo-D3> er
[23:37:16] <Diablo-D3> drugs
[23:37:24] <bomb> I was thinking caffeine pills, actually
[23:37:25] <gufi> oh i know. well aware. i do all this while also puffing on nicotine all day
[23:37:29] <bomb> I mean low blood sugar
[23:37:34] <gufi> stims on top of stims
[23:37:46] <Diablo-D3> bomb: so, basically, the crash happens because you spike your insulin levels hard due to pure sugar
[23:38:04] <Diablo-D3> refined sugar products should never be consumed, causes waaaaaaaay too much long term damage
[23:38:19] * gufi sips on his coke
[23:38:36] <Diablo-D3> combine that and unsaturated rancid seed oils in the american diet, it shaves about 20 years off the life expectancy of males in the US
[23:39:02] <Diablo-D3> its about as bad as drinking or smoking
[23:39:15] <bomb> Diablo-D3 yeah, I won't do dumb shit like getting high on RedBull just to get some caffeine lol
[23:39:21] <Diablo-D3> eat the SAD, drink, AND smoke? you're lucky if you die in your 60s, you might not even make it that far.
[23:39:26] <gufi> high...on redbull?
[23:39:32] <Diablo-D3> bomb: so, remember, this was about adhd
[23:39:45] <bomb> and?
[23:39:48] <Diablo-D3> if gufi isnt on the roof after 3 16oz energy drinks
[23:39:54] <Diablo-D3> then he might have adhd.
[23:40:02] <gufi> is very likely
[23:40:07] <Diablo-D3> this is literally a diagnosing criteria doctors use
[23:40:10] <bomb> he'll find one way or another to crash, I'm sure
[23:40:19] <gufi> that crash is from sugar
[23:40:26] <gufi> thats gonna happen anyway reguardless
[23:40:38] <Diablo-D3> yeah
[23:40:55] <Diablo-D3> people with adhd crash waaaaay harder on sugar rushes than everyone else
[23:41:19] <Diablo-D3> there seems to be an unexplained link between mothers who are pre-diabetic or would otherwise be prone to diabetes later in life and kids having adhd
[23:41:25] <bomb> Diablo-D3 why don't gufi just take caffeine pills if that's what helps adhd?
[23:41:34] <Diablo-D3> bomb: its a shitty solution
[23:41:39] <gufi> wake up-> redbull/2 -> Work -> inability to find ways to motivate self to move or look directly at things
[23:41:49] <Diablo-D3> he'd need to take like 400mg every morning, then 200mg in the afternoon
[23:41:55] <gufi> uugh
[23:41:55] <bomb> it's swallowable though
[23:42:02] <Diablo-D3> thats an alarmingly high dose.
[23:42:03] <bomb> 200mg is one pill
[23:42:24] <Diablo-D3> if he gets on the right adhd med, he'd have a lot less heart attack risk
[23:42:25] <gufi> my heart would fucking explode with that much caffien, i can barely do2 cans of redbull these days because my heart will literally palpatate
[23:42:35] <bomb> okay, but he won't fuck up his insulin level with redbull
[23:42:40] <Diablo-D3> oh yeah no
[23:42:47] <Diablo-D3> he most certainly should be taking it as a pill
[23:42:48] <Diablo-D3> which is what I do
[23:42:58] <Diablo-D3> its the cheapest form of it by far
[23:43:00] <bomb> what dose you take?
[23:43:08] <Diablo-D3> 200mg in the morning, 200mg in the afternoon
[23:43:24] <Diablo-D3> and I have zero caffeine tolerance no matter how much I take
[23:43:44] <bomb> 200mg a day would do for me
[23:43:46] <Diablo-D3> can jump off it and take absolutely fucking nothing for a month, then go back to taking 400mg a day and nothing
[23:43:52] <bomb> then one bottle would take me 100 days
[23:43:52] <Diablo-D3> and Im also undiagnosed adhd
[23:44:00] <Diablo-D3> and thanks to the adhd, Im not progressing on getting it diagnosed
[23:44:05] <Diablo-D3> bomb: naw, they make it even cheaper than that
[23:44:08] <bomb> hah
[23:44:22] <gufi> lolol facts on not progressing
[23:44:41] <gufi> distracted on things my brain decided it wants dopamine from instead of anything that needs to get done
[23:45:02] <Diablo-D3> they make one thats 300 in a $6-7 bottle

[23:45:22] <bomb> I'm in a shithole, that's gonna cost me a lot

[23:48:47] <Diablo-D3> for most people it doesn't do much
[23:48:59] <Diablo-D3> for the people it does, it just keeps the caffeine jitters away
