[03:10:35] <dostoyevsky2> Jong: Goodfellow focusses on understanding the basics...  Confusion Matrices have gained some popularity on kaggle over the years because they look presentable/self-explanatory in a notebook... but it's not a topic that needs to be explained in a book
[03:14:30] <HuntsMan> dostoyevsky2: they are explained, but not in that book, there are thousands of ML books that cover them
[03:15:02] <Jong> but I can't find AUROC mentioned in Godfellow either
[03:15:46] <HuntsMan> same answer
[03:15:56] <HuntsMan> if you want ML basics, then don't read a Deep Learning book
[03:15:58] <HuntsMan> read a Machine Learning book
[03:19:17] <HuntsMan> Jong: the point, what is wrong with the book not covering that kind of stuff?

[04:01:20] <Jong> Then it's a book that belongs on my bookshelf :-D
[04:01:45] <HuntsMan> its two books actually

[04:03:11] <HuntsMan> advanced topics
[04:03:15] <HuntsMan> both books are available in github
[04:03:37] <HuntsMan> I think so far only the introductory book is available in print
[04:10:52] <Jong> HuntsMan  Have you heard of the book Artificial Intelligence A Modern Approach by Russell Norvig ?
[04:11:35] <HuntsMan> hahha yes
[04:15:28] <Jong> What do you think?
[04:16:33] <Jong> I bought it for $5 on ebay. I really like it for an old book
[04:27:10] <HuntsMan> good price
[04:27:14] <HuntsMan> its a book on classical AI
[04:31:48] <Klinda> my teacher doesn't advise deep learning books
[04:31:51] <Klinda> only papers
[04:38:19] <Jong> Reading the old books is interesting. The vocabulary is changes with time.

[15:18:35] <HuntsMan> that's not what I said
[15:18:40] <HuntsMan> but this does look as just tabular data
[15:18:55] <HuntsMan> unless you use the date column to group/window and make a time series
