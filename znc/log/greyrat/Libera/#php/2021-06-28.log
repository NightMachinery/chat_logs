[02:14:26] <ordos> burrows, what are some of the more complicated bash script instructions that you think you'd be better off writing in PHP?

[02:20:08] <burrows> I like scripting, ordos, so even a simple backup script could get complicated lol. OpenVPN wrapper scripts to install servers, add/revoke clients, automatically deal with firewalls, etc. also comes to mind. Things of that nature
[02:24:59] <ordos> burrows, we use a lot of scripts where I work. You're of course aware of the pros and cons of using PHP for scripting vs Bash. So why not use both? We often make use of hybrid scripts. There are more good reasons to justify hybrid scripting language environments than there are good reasons to use a single scripting language exclusively. Just document everything nicely. Is this a solo dev or are you part of a team?
[02:30:55] *** Joins: seand (~seand@69.54.132.6)
[02:31:58] <burrows> solo dev for personal use. I already mix and match bash/php and I even have powersell scripts in my cli git repo...and I hardly use Windows. I find having one central repo dedicated to my shell, which also includes bash aliases, easy to manage for all of my different systems.

[17:48:29] <DrowningElysium> Hello, I am having trouble setting up a regex that will tell me if something else other than a-z A-Z 0-9 _ or the PHP constant DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR is used. I tried !preg_match('/(?![a-zA-Z0-9\\' . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . '_])/', $category) but am not having any luck
[17:50:45] <entuland> if the purpose of that is trying to split a path, you shouldn't be using regexes, there are well tested facilities built into PHP to do that
[17:51:09] <DrowningElysium> It is something like that, but there have been put rules on the pathing
[17:51:13] <AllenJB> It looks like your problem likely comes from trying to escape DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR. I would recommend using preg_quote() to escape it instead
[17:52:14] <entuland> I would still use built in facilities to split any desired path and only check the individual parts against the pathing rules
[17:52:15] <DrowningElysium> Basically we programmers have created category names and there is currently not anything set as a standard. (Wasn't an issue as every translation string was in the database, but we currently want to start using json files)
[17:52:28] <DrowningElysium> The $category is isolated
[17:52:40] <entuland> that way your code would be more explicit in its intentions and clearer to understand when read by a human
[17:53:02] <DrowningElysium> I can assure that this validation logic is needed
[17:53:13] <entuland> I'm not telling you that you shouldn't validate
[17:53:14] <DrowningElysium> Because it really is all over the place
[17:53:32] <entuland> I'm just saying that you may not need to include the directory separator in your regexes
[17:54:00] <entuland> split the path with the built in facilities, check the regex against individual path components using regexes if that's what you need
[17:54:22] <DrowningElysium> Good point
[17:54:27] <DrowningElysium> I could do the conversion after
[17:54:33] <DrowningElysium> I'll do a simple / check
