[01:37:57] <snedd> Sorry if this is not the relevant channel but why is it when I use image: 'mysql/mysql-server:8.0', the container runs as expected, but when I change the version to lets say: 'mysql/mysql-server:5.5' or 5.6, the container just exits with no errors in the docker log?
[01:42:01] <snedd> For context, I have created (by running 1 command from the documentation) a new laravel project, and all I wanted to do was change the mysql version. But when I do this, it just exits (1) with the last line in the log being: "220318 22:05:12 [Note] mysqld (mysqld 5.5.62) starting as process 1 ...". (This was me trying version 5.5.62)

[01:46:40] *** Quits: trevors (~trevors@user/trevors) (Quit: trevors)
[01:47:16] <snedd> Aahh, yes I think you are on to something - I ran the command to build another new laravel project, but this time I changed the mysql to 5.5.62 before starting the containers. 
[01:47:36] <DoofusCanadensis> if you're using the same data volume, it's not backwards compatible
[01:50:38] <snedd> @DoofusCanadensis: Since the docker-compose is generated by Laravel, it uses the volume: 'sail-mysql:/var/lib/mysql'. How could I reset/wipe this volume when running "sail up" (which is essentially, docker-compose up")
[01:52:08] <DoofusCanadensis> `docker compose down --volumes` should do the trick

[02:00:12] <tabakhase> snedd carefull with down -v - this deletes things :P
[02:02:03] <DoofusCanadensis> yes, offered only because "wipe this volume" was asked
[02:02:09] <tabakhase> the "another laravel" project is my kicker here... - cause while the voluem is names "sail-mysql" in the compose, the actual docker-volume would be prefixed with the "compose project name" (what by default is the name of the parent-directory) so say "/devstuff/website/docker-compose.yml with sail-mysql would lead to "website_sail-mysql" to actually be created
[02:03:27] <tabakhase> if you have two "website" projects now, things will go broky --- so you can overwrite that with "-P" or likely better, setting COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME env-var (can be stored into the ".env" file too)
[02:07:00] <snedd> @tabakhase: Always appreciate a heads up! Especially when it comes to deleting any data. Thankfully this was just a brand new laravel project. I feel silly now that I understand what the underlying issue was haha. And thank you for the info about the "website_sail-mysql"/COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME - Taking notes now so I will know next time
[02:09:43] <tabakhase> snedd if you say "recreated the one you deleted" as in "another project" yea sure all fine =) --- ive just seen horrorstories of /devstuff/work/website and /devstuff/internal/website deleting another :D

[04:19:50] <rawtaz> you answered one third of the questions i asked.
[04:19:51] <pidroid> i don't know, standart root installation in /var/lib/docker but when i try in rootless, this is fuse overlay into .local/share/docker/fuse-overlayfs/
[04:20:20] <pidroid> i'm french, i need some time to all understand XD
[04:20:54] <pidroid> overlay2 i hope
[04:22:11] <pidroid> kernel 5.10
[04:23:08] <pidroid> (overlay2 required 5.11 i don't know i did that ^^)
[04:23:20] *** Quits: wakeup (~wakeup@user/wakeup) (Quit: Client closed)
[04:24:06] <pidroid> ok then i can keep fuse-overlayfs but my mounted drive is in /var/lib/docker (then i can change it to  .local/share/docker/fuse-overlayfs/ but maybe a better solution ?)
[04:24:30] <rawtaz> yea, and apparently an ubuntu-flavored kernel as well, so even if you had 5.11 on your debian it probably wont work :o
[04:25:08] <pidroid> ok overylayfs is interesting too
[04:25:15] <pidroid> but how to define the path
[04:25:53] <pidroid> i added this in daemon.json of the user : "data-root": "/var/lib/docker"
[04:26:24] <rawtaz> hm thats odd.. on https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/select-storage-driver/ it says "On Ubuntu and Debian 10, the fuse-overlayfs driver does not need to be used, and overlay2 works even in rootless mode. Refer to the rootless mode documentation for details.". this contradicts the article i linked you to
[04:27:09] <rawtaz> and i dont see any further docs on that page they refer to..
[04:27:17] <rawtaz> fucking docker documentation, always sucks.
[04:27:21] <pidroid> maybe a limitation only for rootless ?
[04:27:22] * rawtaz starts ranting again
[04:27:26] <pidroid> arf... :D
[04:28:08] <rawtaz> well we have one page saying overlayfs2 does NOT work in rootless, unless you have ubuntu and kernel 5.11. then we have another page saying the exact opposite.
[04:28:13] <rawtaz> really genius.
[04:28:36] <rawtaz> and we also have the fact that your rootless installation actively changed to another driver than overlayfs2, which suggests that was done for a reason.
[04:28:58] <pidroid> i spent all this day to try to make a rootless install (i'm beginner with docker but... hard to do...)
[04:29:08] <rawtaz> quite an endeavour :)
[04:29:09] <rawtaz> well done!
[04:29:18] <rawtaz> anyway, i dont know how to change hte path of that fuse thing, i never used it.
[04:29:35] <rawtaz> but i hope someone else in here can answer, theres lots of folks here who are skilled with docker stuff, so stick around :)

[19:15:32] <ottavio> The application must be installed on other *nix systems that don't support docker( say, FreeBSD, etc)

[19:25:02] <lantech19446> I know I'm not proficient enough with docker yet to do this but I'm wondering, if I built a server with a custom image and kubernetes to scale it up as needed could I have remote computers access it with say pxe boot and use the image as their OS?

[19:32:56] <lantech19446> I just haven't figured out a use case yet, I don't really have the resources for all out virtualization anyway but other than something like that the only thing I've thought of is moving my web server to it
[19:33:13] <lantech19446> putting ansible in one container and the webserver in another 
[19:36:44] <ikke> Typically you use docker for an entire application
[19:38:45] <lantech19446> ansible would be an entire application and so would apache
[19:39:25] <ikke> you never 'just' deploy apache :)
[19:40:42] <lantech19446> obviously there's configurations but why couldn't docker house them as well? One of the things I always see referenced is running some form of httpd in docker
[19:41:18] <ikke> lantech19446: typically you haver apache hosting some application or website
[19:41:52] <ikke> The idea is that you are able to ship an entire application as a docker image
[19:41:56] <lantech19446> in this case it's a website so it's just a bunch of files but if you can run apache or nginx in docker it must be able to handle that otherwise it's pointless

[19:45:31] <lantech19446> these wouldn't be separate i'd be running them on the same computer so I could have multiple containers running on the same system I just see it as a better solution than hyper-v solution i'm using right now
