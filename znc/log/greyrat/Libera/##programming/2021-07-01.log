[02:26:19] <pyzozord> I have a question about writing compilers. I'm an utter layman in this area, all I know is "abstract syntax trees". I've recently work on a linting plugin for eslint (static analysis tool from javascript), so I was literally working on a visitor function that was visiting every node of the AST. And I started wondering:

[02:27:32] <pyzozord> If I were to build a compiler there would be a parsing phase that would construct the AST. Then I'd need to write (whatever is the name for) the thing that based on AST generates compiled code. Here is my question:

[02:28:46] <Necoro> AbleBacon: time to ditch VS :) I've never used it personally, but've never encountered anyone happy with it
[02:29:00] <Izem> Necoro what do you use?
[02:29:04] <AbleBacon> i am forced to use it
[02:29:08] <Izem> also it might not be feasible to ditch
[02:29:15] <pyzozord> As my compiler walks down the AST it may encounter some expression "foo = 42" expression may be correct but what if foo was declared before? It must somehow remember everything that was defined before this line. Does that mean that as compiler traverses the AST it builds a massive map of all objects in all scopes?
[02:29:34] <Izem> yeah, that's called the symbol table
[02:29:48] <Izem> nice intuition :)
[02:29:49] <Twipply> You could always look at the LLVM Kaleidoscope tutorial
[02:29:55] <pyzozord> And if so, doesn't that mean that compiler will know less about "foo" in some earlier places it visited, then in other places it visited later?
[02:29:56] <Necoro> Izem: depends on the language: vim, jetbrains stuff, vs code

[02:31:19] <Izem> Necoro do you use vim for remote sessions?
[02:31:52] <Necoro> pyzozord: that's why there may be multiple passes to have later knowledge ready at hand
[02:32:32] <Necoro> Izem: yes, solely. But the last time I had to program via a remote session I a decade or so in the past
[02:33:01] <Necoro> (well... there were the mainframe cobol stuff, but that doesn't count -- and I forgot how the editor was called)
[02:33:03] <pyzozord> Necoro: I know about Jon Blow's compiler that has a meta-language compile-time executin feature where the compiler will feed a stream of chunks of the AST to custom functions that will be executed. It sounds like that couldn't have been built with multi-pass approach, right?
[02:34:09] <Necoro> pyzozord: perhaps it's not needed.

[04:03:37] <xsperry> jeaye, monads are great abstraction for modeling various things in the FP world. but you need a decent type system to make them truly useful, whereas clojure doesn't even have types, and runtime tags it has are just glorified dictionaries. I think learning haskell will give one a lot more bang for the buck, than learning clojure, especially if the goal is to learn FP

I would like to know how that works (both on the server and the client). Do they generate codes and save it in a database?  For netflix, the codes are not time-based, they dont
[04:51:12] <abhisek> change with time. So I am guessing totp is not what they are using.

[10:22:22] <Arahael> blahboybaz: "throw" generally jumps to the nearest handler for the exception, but this highly depends on language.  In Javascript, I expect it will walk up the stack and pretty much jump right into the first matching handler it finds.

[12:22:36] <mrig> Perhaps separate the binaries out of the git aspect and use some other tool for that?
[12:23:16] <mrig> From what I gather, you are not really supposed to use binaries with git, I could be wrong but, that is not really what it is good at.
[12:24:21] <mrig> I know that is not what it does, but perhaps there is some work around though. You would be filling your repo up with a lot of junk, make sure to prune it often I suppose.
[12:24:27] <AndroidDAW> basically what i am trying to create is a prebuild action that will build my repo and then push the built libs to a dedicated branch
[12:24:56] <mrig> use git and also rsync perhaps?

[13:56:20] <mrig> A straight forwards question: would you override the need for escaping math symbols in the URL bar so that expressions can be written normaly?
[13:57:15] <mrig> So that http://localhost:8000/?expr=sin(3)+4 will work, or is this an unnecessary sugar coating on a UI?
[13:58:25] <deniska> any url parsing library will interprete + as a space
[13:58:34] <mrig> sure yes it is.
[13:58:47] <mrig> and this works fine when escaped.
[13:59:03] *** Quits: Intelo (~Intelo@88.246.73.216) (Quit: Client closed)
[13:59:22] <deniska> if you have + in a resulting url, it better mean space, otherwise you open yourself to the world of pain and suffering
[13:59:53] <mrig> but the interface is awful like this, which is why I was thinking that I could perhaps undo the escaping only on endpoints that read expressions.
[14:00:11] <mrig> deniska: Right I was wondering if this would be the case, why so exactly?
[14:00:41] <deniska> mrig: because every http middleware/client/etc along the way will treat + as if it was space
[14:00:53] <mrig> but this will go no where else.
[14:01:02] <mrig> has no dependencies.

[14:01:17] <deniska> what creates the url?
[14:01:20] <mrig> the issue is that I am passing an expression through nested framse.
[14:01:28] <mrig> to update two url at once.
[14:01:37] <deniska> if it's a browser, you are going to battle a browser not to escape it
[14:01:43] <mrig> not two url but two data objects.
[14:02:18] <mrig> Yes I am battling the browser at the moment, would like to keep a list of expressions used, in the same frame as the output.
[14:02:23] <deniska> url creators know that + means space, url consumers know that + means space, you'll have pain at each step of the process
[14:02:47] <mrig> It is only one isolated usecase though.

[14:03:35] <mrig> GeDaMo: the thing is that I am including the url as the src within a template.
[14:03:47] <mrig> of a nested iframe
[14:04:39] <mrig> so that when an expression is passed in, it updates the iframes content by rewriting a nested iframes address.
[14:05:18] <mrig> Works fine, it is just that in this usecase the expression contains mathematical expressions,
[14:05:28] *** Joins: elnavigator (~elnavigat@105.196.44.12)
[14:05:48] <mrig> I will leave it as it is I think, that if you want to store a graph as a URL it has to be escaped.
[14:06:23] <piou> nested iframes...

[14:06:48] <mrig> just thought that it could be nice to be able to write expressions to an API too, perhaps receive an svg from a GET command.
[14:07:16] <mrig> piou: Well I am exploring at the moment, finding out what and were the limits are.
[14:07:44] <mrig> It is surprisingly flexible when the content of a frame is an svg.
[14:07:56] <mrig> I should say iframe to avoid confusion.
[14:08:16] <mrig> or a list of media content boxes with database data in it.

[14:16:42] <piou> Thing is, I don't really want to take the time to understand your specific context, so while I am surprised I certainly wouldn't want to say that this is stupid

[18:03:00] <Arahael> AndroidDAW: you could also use powershell on linux.
[18:05:39] <piou> I'm not asking because "powershell bad" or anything, but you would essentially need a "dd" like feature working on files as a set of bytes and cutting a specific section from them in order to implement your split, and that's something that I tried to do before with powershell without finding a good way to do it. I ended up using another language.

[23:02:31] <mrig> Hum, that has got me wondering if that might work on a database of images that I've got at home.
[23:03:11] <mrig> would but superb if it could, but am dubious. Would make for an interesting project though to find out.
[23:05:08] <mrig> Would be nice if it could recognise lighting conditions and apply filters for a similar image output across a selection of raw camera files.
[23:06:17] <jamea> java question: i get this errror: "non static method getCell2(String, XSSFWorkbook, int) cannot be referenced from a static context" the definition: public Cell getCell2(String cellName, XSSFWorkbook wb, int noSheet) {  and i call: Cell celdaActual2 = getCell("D2, myWorkBook, xSheet); any advice how to fix?
