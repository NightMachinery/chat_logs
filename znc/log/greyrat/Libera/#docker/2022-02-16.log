[05:22:00] <ada_> Tach: I did not parse that question well
[05:23:29] <ada_> davit: sure, you can, but if you want to run your code you'll probably need to send API requests to an actual docker engine 
[05:28:25] <davit> ada: I am trying to pull and push images not run any of it, would that work or since pull and push use the daemon I need it installed
[05:28:52] <Tach> ada_ let;s say I map a vhost dir for nginx, I need some sftp server that maps to the same folder but also have users that are able to upload so the webserver doesn't have issues with rights...
[05:29:09] <Tach> also... where to store the users

[05:46:40] <ada_> Tach: seems like something like this might do the trick https://hub.docker.com/r/atmoz/sftp
[05:46:55] <ada_> you can configure users with whatever uid/gid you want in order to match the uid/gid that owns the nginx vhost dir

[11:26:58] <davit> pagios, One machine running multiple containers is preferred method I believe
[11:28:05] <dreamer> if you have too many computers it's fine to run one container per machine .. tiny bit a waste of resources perhaps ..
[11:28:33] <dreamer> ever since the 90s we've had these computers that can run more than one task at a time .. so why not

[17:26:55] <kdehl> I'm trying out zenoh that uses servers that use multicast to find other nodes on a network, but they don't seem to be able to find one another.
[17:27:43] <kdehl> I do see a multicast message popping up using tcpdump on another node when I start a server, but I can be fooling myself; I'm quite new to the world of multicast.

[17:45:41] <kdehl> Shoot, sorry.
[17:45:55] <kdehl> I do see IGMP on other containers when using iperf according to: https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2006/09/generating-multicast-traffic.html
[17:45:58] <kdehl> Is what I meant.
[17:47:34] <tianon> just doing "docker run" with no "--network" argument?  without more topology information it's hard to speculate :)
[17:47:58] <kdehl> Heh. Yeah, sorry. This is what I do:
[17:48:07] <kdehl> docker run --rm --name nettest3 -it --network z --network-alias net3 nicolaka/netshoot
[17:48:15] <kdehl> The 3 is 2 and 1 on other containers.
[17:48:30] <tianon> and network z is overlay? bridge?  single-host?  multi-host?
[17:48:49] <tianon> just "docker network create z" ? :)
[17:49:07] <kdehl> Just docker network create z, yes.
[17:49:23] <tianon> ah, then that should be a bridge network, and multicast should work just fine between containers attached to it, yes :)
[17:49:27] <kdehl> It's about as simple as it gets.
[17:49:36] <kdehl> Great!
[17:49:51] <kdehl> That's all I want for now. :)
[17:50:07] <tianon> if you do "docker network inspect z" you should also see "Driver": "bridge"
[17:50:24] <tianon> where "bridge" here refers to a kernel bridge network (if you wanted to look up more technical details)
[17:50:46] <kdehl> Bridge, indeed.
[17:51:19] <kdehl> I thought at first bridge meant it is bridged with your host's NIC, but that's not true, is it?
[17:51:32] <tianon> bridge networking is the default way Docker sets up the NAT for individual containers on a single host :)
[17:51:48] <kdehl> Ah, right.
[17:51:54] <tianon> if you just "docker run" without --network, there's also a "default" bridge network that Docker uses
[17:52:08] <tabakhase> kdehl i got no clue what "zenoh " is - but `zenoh cluster docker-compose`
[17:52:16] <tabakhase> in google doesnt look like people do such things?
[17:53:34] <tianon> yeah, on a single host I'm not sure I understand the value (unless it's part of a larger system you're just trying to deploy and this is a component already), hence the questions about whether this is a multi-host setup O:)
[17:53:46] <tabakhase> should been one message :P   --- like, if you search for "elasticsearch cluster docker-compose" or there like youll find heaps of people running 3+ instances there bundled as examples - while "zenoh" only related at all is there single-node example from the docs...
[17:54:17] <tabakhase> so smelling a bit like its "not indeded to work this way"... -- this is far-far-guestimating tho
[17:54:49] <tianon> looks like https://zenoh.io/docs/getting-started/quick-test/ has some good notes
[17:55:23] <tianon> appears that it supports using non-multicast too
[17:55:40] <kdehl> tianon, tabakhase: Yeah, this is only an evaluation of the software. I want to understand how it works, put some data into it and retrieve it, see how it spreads to other nodes etc.
[17:56:54] <kdehl> tianon: Yeah, I have really tried to follow those examples, but I know there are bugs in the software already and the documetns don't seem to be quite up to date, so I don't trust it too much.
[17:57:06] <tianon> 🙈
[17:58:20] <tabakhase> kdehl what is even the "other" end then? any docs/sample for that? - there "scaleable -> more info" just goes to the docs/home m(
[17:59:09] <kdehl> tabakhase: https://zenoh.io/docs/getting-started/key-concepts/
[18:00:40] <tianon> "just run lots and it works!" is very compelling :)
[18:00:51] <tabakhase> nothing tels that image anywhere what it shall be tho? -- hop in the image and see whats actually running there... wonder if thats a "fat container" with a init that contains all components configured as demo - rather than "beeing a docker image of the software"...
[18:00:52] <kdehl> Heh. Yeah really.
[18:01:17] <kdehl> tabakhase: I'll have a look.
[18:01:53] <tianon> it appears to be written in Rust and invokes just "zenohd" in the container, as far as I can tell
[18:01:57] <tabakhase> https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh/blob/master/Dockerfile#L52 seems it at least can ship -args
[18:02:30] <tianon> I'm not sure I understand why that's a whole script and not just ENTRYPOINT ["/zenohd"] lol
[18:02:57] <tianon> it'll handle spaces in arguments incorrectly as-is, which is probably ~fine? at least for current arguments?

[18:06:42] <kdehl> tianon: Yeah, I'm afraid this piece of software is in early stages of development. I struggled for days trying to setup a different backend, but finally gave up. Something just ain't right.

[18:08:16] <tianon> yeah, if you want to grow beyond a single container host, I'd suggest looking into their non-multicast options
[18:08:40] <kdehl> Do they even have that?
[18:08:49] <kdehl> I thought multicast was how they found one another. Huh.
[18:08:55] <tianon> it's in the docs, although I haven't checked the code :)
[18:09:02] <tianon> they appear to default to multicast, yes
[18:09:28] <tabakhase> kdehl well look into the config inside your cntainer i guess - that example from github may be entirely unrelated - OR what it defaults to *shrugs*
[18:09:30] <tianon> but non-multicast is explicitly supported, especially because containers and multicast aren't always best friends (networking is kind of complicated when you add more than one host)

[18:28:28] <ada_> you could also use zenoh1 as the name of the "router" instead of looking up the IP
[18:28:35] <kdehl> How annoying that it doesn't complain about it.

[18:31:48] <kdehl> Holy shit, it works!
[18:32:43] <kdehl> I'm quite new to Docker too, but the way I understand it now, is that I should setup a docker-compose.yml file that will configure two containers for me automagically.
[18:33:08] <kdehl> It's still strange that they don't seem to be able to discover one another.
[18:34:41] <kdehl> Maybe multicast is indeed turned off by default. Gotta investigate.
[18:34:51] <kdehl> Thanks everyone for your help and suggestions!
[18:36:16] <tabakhase> kdehl well i still ownder if the dont do cause they cant - or cause they dont even try... -- that default config, plus the extra "peer" switch to kick it.... - id say play around with a few of the cfg values ((with --cfg='PATH:VALUE' or so)) to "kick this peer vs router" decision..
[18:36:56] <kdehl> tabakhase: Will do!
[18:37:00] <tabakhase> (like under the multicast.enabled:false is also anther "mode" switch by the looks)

[18:57:40] <kdehl> Wait. I don't need the --network-alias argument? Huh.
[19:00:39] <ada_> I didn't see where you were using it, but --network-alias can be used to add additional aliases to a container name
[19:00:55] <ada_> by default, a container attached to a network can be resolved by its container (or service) name
[19:01:05] <ada_> you can add additional aliases to the container IP with that flag
[19:01:21] <ada_> maybe your container name is really really long or you just want to alias 'postgres' to 'db' or something
[19:01:38] <kdehl> Right.
[19:01:49] <ada_> or maybe you're reverse engineering a monolithic app and you want to replace a hardcoded connection to `mysql-server` with mariadb and call it 'mysql-server' on the network regardless of its container name
[19:02:26] <ada_> oh and multicast doesn't work on container networks
[19:02:31] <kdehl> Right. I really like Docker more and more.
[19:02:32] <ada_> unicast only
[19:02:40] <kdehl> Huh? Not even between containers?
[19:02:42] <ada_> correct
[19:02:54] <kdehl> Well, there's no wonder it doesn't work then.
[19:03:01] <ada_> you can with the `macvlan` network driver
[19:03:16] <ada_> but the default `bridge` driver uses the host as a router and it just doesn't pass multi/broadcast packets
[19:03:31] <kdehl> Okay. I see.
[19:03:33] <ada_> (not to be confused with the network named `bridge`)
[19:03:43] <kdehl> Right.
[19:04:23] <tabakhase> ada_ noe? - pls read again, hes talking about "container to container on the same docker-daemon" - to all our understanding, and a previous test, that should work just fine
[19:04:27] <kdehl> But I did get something from tcpdump when zenohd started up. It does some magic multicast exploration of its surroundings when it boots.
[19:04:35] <programmerq> is it container-to-container multicast that is what is needed?
[19:04:47] <kdehl> programmerq: Yes.
[19:04:53] <minimal> yeah I remember a while ago when setting up a docker-based Elasticsearch cluster having to disable the Elasticsearch "discovery" (which AFAIK is multicast based) and tell each ES cluster node the names of the other nodes
[19:04:55] <programmerq> I thought the bridge driver works for container-to-container, it just doesn't NAT the multicast to nor from the host network
[19:05:09] <ada_> i was mistaken
[19:05:14] <ada_> i was thinking of swarm's networks
[19:05:15] <kdehl> ada_: Phew. :)
[19:05:16] <programmerq> and the overlay network doesn't do multicast because there's a tunnel to each node anyway.
[19:05:19] <ada_> ^
[19:05:22] <ada_> thats my mistake
[19:05:34] <programmerq> but I haven't tried multicast on a bridge network personally.
[19:05:40] <kdehl> Alright. Good. I'm relieved.
[19:05:57] <ada_> ty pq
[19:06:04] <programmerq> but the macvlan driver should also work with multicast, but there's a higher barrier of entry to getting a macvlan network going since you need to rely on an external gateway.
[19:06:31] <programmerq> but I haven't specifically testing multicast on that driver either
[19:06:37] <programmerq> I'm just going on what I remember about how it all works.
[19:06:39] <kdehl> I see. Well, for this purpose I just want several containers on the same host to talk to one another using multicast.

[22:23:48] <humanBird> this software that i'm using specifically has a conda requirements.
[22:24:06] <humanBird> activating a virtualenv won't help
[22:24:21] <programmerq> humanBird the activate in conda and virtualenv have similar implementations. you haven't provided anything of substance in your question, so folks are guessing.
[22:25:35] <humanBird> the error complains about setting up a shell.  then restarting the shell ... in my host i don't have to do any of this  "conda activate" just runs
[22:25:52] <programmerq> why not share the full command you are running and the full output
[22:25:55] <programmerq> that's a good place to start
[22:26:18] <programmerq> use a paste service
[22:27:06] <humanBird> https://github.com/ContinuumIO/docker-images/issues/89  this is pretty much the same issue i'm facing
[22:27:52] <humanBird> the RUN conda activate myenv or similar docker command fails
[22:28:00] <programmerq> 'RUN conda activate' by itself doesn't make sense
[22:28:26] <humanBird> the issue i linked outlines it well. i'm even using the same miniconda3 tag
[22:28:27] <programmerq> each RUN directive is supposed to set up files for a new image layer. conda activate sets env vars and paths and stuff, and isn't really changing files.
[22:29:01] <programmerq> the comments in that issue also point out that you can do 'conda run ....' in your CMD or 'RUN conda run ...' if you need to have a RUN directive with the conda environment active
[22:29:48] <humanBird> so i need to prepend any sort of thing that requires a conda enviornment active with "conda run <some enviornment> " ?
[22:29:57] <humanBird> that seems like a problem
[22:29:58] <programmerq> in a RUN directive, yes.
[22:30:35] <humanBird> what if i forget to copy paste this conda run before a command and get bugs... i don't feel that copy pasting "conda run <somenv>" is a good solution at all

[22:36:20] <NOTevil> there's conda specific solutions on the site/url I mentioned.  interesting, I didn't know what conda did different then virtualenv, but since it is more flexible -- it would have to be different.
[22:37:55] <humanBird> i've read the info on that site. there's no conda specific info related to it.
[22:38:43] <humanBird> this issue is over 3 years old... i guess this is impossible to fix
[22:39:16] <programmerq> except for the solutions it has that I pointed out that you are refusing to try. If you don't want to get help, then why bother asking? It's a little strange to be honest.
[22:42:19] <humanBird> i've looked at the run thing and doing a ln from /bin/sh to /bin/bash or other hacks and none seem to work.  source activate "seems" to work but i'm using deprecated api to start a conda env.  nothing is really working the way it should.  i can't seriously believe that any of these solutions won't cause problems down the road
[22:42:28] <programmerq> "xyz doesn't work!" "write it as yxz instead" "that's not a solution!"
[22:42:48] <NOTevil> I clicked the "Docker" link under articles and there was an entry for conda.  shrug.
[22:44:38] <humanBird> when i docker run -it the image, i'm able to conda activate.  the RUN conda activate doesn't work when building the image.  this is very poor behavior IMHO

[23:09:55] <humanBird> sure if you restart xterm the env might not be active anymore but it doesn't error out completely when you run "conda activate" after installing it properly (at least with no errors)
[23:10:13] *** Joins: jazzy (~jaziz@user/jaziz)
[23:10:41] <humanBird> conda activate will error only if the installation failed and there is no conda.
[23:12:51] <humanBird> in your analogy to xterm, i'm not even at the point of running anything after the initial xterm shell. i'm not even closing it.  i'm simply issuing a command, "conda activate" which errors.

[23:13:54] <humanBird> the problem i'm facing is akin to installing gcc, then trying to run gcc and it says "gcc not found".  i've done this in docker before and magically, gcc doesn't complain when i simply issue a RUN gcc command.

[23:20:36] <humanBird> if it's just using a "new" shell each time, shouldn't nothing run because it's completely new with no environmental variables nothing is set?  that's what it sounds like you're saying when it comes to layers.  it'll open up a new shell with no bashrc, no env, nothing  that kind of ruins the point of installing software in the first place.  all
[23:20:37] <humanBird> you should be able to do is run basic linux comands like cat ls rm etc.

[23:22:31] <tabakhase> humanBird aprox. correct yes
[23:22:55] <tabakhase> env can be set, but with the extra ENV command from a dockerfile, not "by storing the current" so to say
[23:23:27] <tabakhase> and you can totally run "basic linux commands"
[23:23:51] <humanBird> i don't understand how uwsgi is able to be installed and it recognizes "uwsgi" at the command line when i docker run -it the image.
[23:24:14] <humanBird> how does it recognize "uwsgi" if there's nothing that describes or links or "stores" what uwsgi is?
[23:24:21] <tabakhase> last i dont see the "kind of ruins the point of installing software" part... -- with maybe the note that "generally you also cant just use a container to install software" - but more a "someone has to build a container for that software" where this 'dockerizing' may evolve more or less work
[23:25:21] <humanBird> doesn't pip/conda install and set enviornmental variables without ENV directives in the dockerfile?
[23:25:39] <humanBird> wouldn't a "new layer" wipe that out so you can never run what you installed via pip?
[23:25:58] <tabakhase> like, not everyhting can be configured by env-variables - and you cant use systemd-unit or init.d startscripts or suich but "need to find out how thats run in the foreground"
[23:26:20] <tabakhase> and the layers "stack" ontop of another - but thats mostly about the underlaying filesystem
[23:26:46] <humanBird> somehow i'm still able to type uwsgi  from the docker run -it  and do RUN uwsgi all the same.  it finds uwsgi without the ENV.  but it sounds like this "new layer" business should wipe that all out

[23:27:24] <tabakhase> so your /some/path/bin/thing is still there, but a modified PATH is gonski indeed -- you could either "fix path via ENV" - or use the full path instead and gg
[23:28:17] <tabakhase> but for a "do this to fix" its kinda to soon - havent even seen your actual "problem" yet ;-) 
[23:28:45] <humanBird> there's a link up there pointing to a 3 year old unresolved conda environment issue

[23:29:25] <humanBird> it really does sound like the "solution" is to install and then explicitly reinstall binaries by manually setting ENV.  This is ridiculous.

[23:30:09] <tabakhase> its not "reinstalling"
[23:30:54] <tabakhase> its just "only cause you yell "bla" how the f. would it know you want to execute /some/junk/noone/seen/before/bla? - like that be horrible if shells would just randomly execute anything they could find on disk :-)
[23:31:21] <tabakhase> so, all ya do is "check in /some/junk/noone/seen/before as well" by adding it to the preexisting PATH var ;-)
[23:31:47] <humanBird> basically, repeating steps in normal install process
[23:31:56] <tabakhase> that said - if there IS a command to source that venv - use that?

[23:37:13] <tabakhase> (also i think for RUN steps you cant pick, but at least to "create a container" you could force it to be fake-interactive --- but this "conda shell.bash hook" likely does smth already...)
[23:38:33] <tabakhase> after that ist rly just that "you have t rerun it whenever" -- so a run may be "RUN venv activate && thingfromvenv --do..." - or for the container-phase youd have a entrypoint that runs the "activate"  --- (assuming confda is somewhat similar)
[23:39:36] <tabakhase> ((note to this, dont use venv in docker, it is a venv in itself already :P - no clue if conda-relevant :D))
[23:41:03] <humanBird> so if there's 100 pip packages to install in a requirements.txt, i should manually download each wheel and manually install the python and then manually install all 100 packages?
[23:41:54] <humanBird> anyways. i'm probably just going to deploy without docker at this point.  conda + docker just doesn't work apparently.
[23:42:04] <dodo> the venv isolates you from the os.. you still have an os in the container
[23:43:46] <tabakhase> dodo the "os" in a container is purely there so you can abuse yum/apt/rpm/apk and such :D  -- and not much to issolate given your thing is supposed to be the only thing in this filesystem ;-)
[23:44:10] <tabakhase> humanBird i did not say to "not use a package manager" -- guess your analog is "global install" then
[23:44:11] <dodo> an os is not a thing?
[23:45:21] <humanBird> wouldn't i still run into the "new shell" thing?  i'd have to set the ENV for every single package installed because new layers wipe out all ENV
[23:46:21] <tabakhase> then use the activate command instead -- (also PATH is directorys, npm, phpcomposer and there like usually have "one" /bin dir one can use - no need to deepdive)
[23:47:33] <humanBird> feels like i'm going in circles with this.  the virtualen environment command to activate doesn't even work.
[23:47:44] <humanBird> it errors.
[23:47:46] <NOTevil> it sure seems like conda works fine in docker from the article.  they even cover what does and doesn't work -- and why.
[23:48:28] <tabakhase> (that said, often "just setting the bin" isnt all you want, often such "things" set a bunch more of env-variables - hence if there is an inbuild command, nothing wrong with using that instead)
[23:48:39] <dodo> humanBird: how does it error?

[23:57:22] <humanBird> it's more like RUN conda install uwsgi && conda activate    <== erroring on the conda activate part.  It's pretty conclusive that layers have nothing to do with it.  conda just isn't working in this image.
[23:59:49] <humanBird> from continuumio/miniconda3
[23:59:50] <humanBird> RUN conda create -n engine python=3.7 && conda activate      This is the actual 2 line dockerfile to reproduce the issue.   it's not a layer issue.  it's a "most software doesn't work in docker" issue.
