[00:45:12] <sazawal> phogg, Well, but somewhere I do have to interface it as the rest of the code is in python. I am not very well versed with C to be honest.
[00:45:16] <phogg> sazawal: and the reason it would be better is you could then do arbitrary other things with the results while being sure it wouldn't touch slow media.
[00:45:41] <phogg> sazawal: C is easy! It's python that's hard.
[00:45:51] <phogg> sazawal: but only for this *particular* use case, mind you

[00:52:00] * [[R]] crashes
[00:52:13] <phogg> sazawal: in C++ you get both pointers and references (which freaks people out)
[00:52:14] <Sauvin> phogg, I used to see people getting tripped up by the concept of pointers all the time. My impression was that most of those people had zero assembly language background.
[00:53:01] <Sauvin> Once having gotten pointers (more or less) mastered, people used to get royally bollixed by the concept of having to allocate memory - and *freeing* it when it's no longer needed.
[00:53:23] <phogg> Sauvin: If you try to learn them correctly and fail then that will be the likely outcome. Learning them incorrectly is a better way to go if you don't plan to spend much time in C.
[00:53:23] * neshpion RAIIs out of scope
[00:53:39] <Sauvin> I think it's potentially dangerous to conflate pointers with references because most languages featuring references also feature garbage collection, which C does NOT.
[00:54:21] <phogg> they *can* be thought of as the same, with careful API design and some discipline. For people dipping toes into C the difference isn't too important to start with

[02:35:17] <horseface> is there a difference in the security provided by:
[02:35:18] <horseface> For system-level administration (i.e. global settings and image-volume location), libvirt minimally requires setting up authorization, and starting the daemon.
[02:35:19] <horseface> Note: For user-session administration, daemon setup and configuration is not required; authorization, however, is limited to local abilities; the front-end will launch a local instance of the libvirtd daemon.
[02:35:36] <horseface> between system-level and user-session admin?

[06:24:14] <gordonfish> (Particularly great is its ability to nest/include one syntax inside of another (like JS inside of a <script> tag, CSS in <style>, within the HTML syntax)
[06:24:18] <gordonfish> )
[06:25:08] <gordonfish> That is, it uses the existing JS and CSS definitions instead of redefining them.

[06:25:32] <Khaytsus> Yeah I like sublime, I just have a very old, unsupported version as I'm not paying $80 again for it
[06:26:03] <Psi-Jack> [[R]]: Well, they're seperate programs for one, Sublime Merge and Sublime Text. And is not Electron.
[06:26:19] <[[R]]> lol
[06:26:23] <gordonfish> Khaytsus: That too, I love the ModernPerl syntax, as well as the seperate Mojo one that works with the main Perl one (so ModernPerl if that is installed) and handles both templates in __DATA__ and separate mojo template files.

[08:19:13] <kveroneau> Microcontrollers have special use-cases, either you need one or you don't.  It can't run programs you'd normally run on a standard Pi like web services, or PiHole.  But, what it can do better I guess is real-time controlling of external devices attached to it's pins, so it's more similar to an Arduino than anything.

[08:21:17] <kveroneau> The PineTime ships with a custom C-based firmware, but it's not as easy to develop for as MicroPython is.

[09:56:03] <Voxel> How would you set up a logic which would update a remote web site code each git push? Currently, I'm struggling with the following issue. There's a remote bare repo. Local repo has it set. The problem is to have the same remote git code represent an actual website, so I tried making a script which would update it using git hooks - post-update. The post-update file runs a script which basically
[09:56:05] <Voxel> clears website directory and clones the repo contents to it, and thus the issue - permissions. Remote is accessible via SSH special git user, and the files are being created with it - git:nogroup, but the webserver is running under www-data. The solution I though is to create a script which would chown and chmod the files each push. The script would contain a sudo command and would be writable only
[09:56:07] <Voxel> by root.

[09:56:48] <ranger> Sorry Sauvin mate, wont do it again, I didn't know, but I do now
[09:57:16] <Voxel> So: push -> post-update script (clone repo, chown, chomd). But this requires a sepecific script and /etc/sudoers enrty for this scritp and git user.
[09:57:43] <Voxel> The technique would work, but it looks more like a workaround
[09:57:50] <Voxel> How would it be more appropriate?
[09:58:16] <Voxel> The main issue: update web files with each remote git repo push (which contains these web files).

[23:37:02] <MinusOne> kj7rrv, the best touchscreen experience I have had for a tablet is xfce4 with the docklike plugin. The real pain regardless of the DE you use is setting up all the apps you want to use in a way that it optimized for touch. Expect to write a lot of tiny scripts and tweak a lot of config files
[23:38:06] <dontyouloveshort> [[R]], had to disable it, wouldnt work otherwise. it will be the INPUT chain
[23:38:27] <ccp> Salzimt_: no idea, never seen that
[23:38:29] <hexnewbie> dontyouloveshort: You can log the packets before dropping them. You can also log the packets now *without* dropping them
[23:38:50] <[[R]]> dontyouloveshort: right, so capture the output fo the configuration that doesnt work

[23:39:30] <MinusOne> kj7rrv, I also found an invisible icon pack, and used onboard as an onscreen keyboard. And disabled gtk tooltips, because otherwise you will have random tooltips from the last thing you touched cluttering the screen

[23:41:02] <MinusOne> kj7rrv, the best way to think about it is that you are setting up a kiosk like experience that will seamlessly switch between a small handful of apps.

[23:53:34] <[[R]]> pnbeast: it supports vehicular transport...
[23:53:57] <hexnewbie> pnbeast: Um. Apparently I'm misremembering, the given bridge is dropping all traffic to the bridge group address, i.e. blocking STP. ARP is allowed, only became an issue at one point (it may have been temporarily blocked as an alternative to unplugging cable, but was fixed at the ARP source).

[23:54:26] <pnbeast> I don't want your bridge, [[R]].  Unless, maybe, it goes into NYC.  Does go into the city?
[23:54:42] <hexnewbie> pnbeast: I'm still selling the Brooklyn Bridge
[23:54:45] <[[R]]> pnbeast: it goes into a city... but... 🎶 the city of compton...

[23:57:49] <pnbeast> [[R]], wait, if a *real* bridge blocks all TCP traffic, too, does that mean your car can't cross it?  Like maybe if it were somehow Faraday caged?

[23:58:19] <[[R]]> pnbeast: tesla run on pure UDP traffic
[23:58:22] <[[R]]> teslas*
[23:58:29] <pnbeast> I can't believe that.
[23:58:30] <[[R]]> dropped packets be damned!
[23:58:48] <pnbeast> How much does your car have to be online?  Regularly?  Once in a while?  Never?
[23:58:57] <hexnewbie> HTTP/3 is UDP. That makes TCP deprecated!
[23:59:31] <pnbeast> I love TCP.  It's a whole layer I don't have to code!
[23:59:39] <pnbeast> Well, a whole feature.
