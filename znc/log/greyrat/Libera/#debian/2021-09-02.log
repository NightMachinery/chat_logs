[00:21:33] <wintersky> well, they will never feel the real taste of linux like that
[00:21:59] <wintersky> i had cygwin in the xp days and it ok
[00:23:17] <ede> it helps at least to get it started
[00:23:31] <ede> and learn that even the command line is a nice place in linux
[00:23:49] <wintersky> most users that daily use windows don't need wsl anyway and have no clue how to use it
[00:24:03] <ede> same here for some time, but then dual boot. cygwin just for some tools i wanted to run on xp i guess
[00:24:49] <wintersky> cygwin was allowing doing things on windows that were impossible otherwise
[00:25:07] <wintersky> now there is wsl, idk what to think about that

[00:40:24] <ede> true that. the oter mox is a used ThinkCentre from 2012 iirc, removed the Win10 HDD (another one needing special holders for them which i don't have enough of), and then it was a struggle to get it to boot linux. can't even remember how i changed it, if it's even still in safe mode or what they call it.

[01:53:51] <freem> Hi. I am trying to rebuild mpd to remove some dependencies it have, and the `rules` file have this: "  dh $@ --with sphinxdoc" which is something I would like to disable. Am I correct to suppose I can just replace "with" by "without"?
[01:54:35] <wintersky> isn't there a readme in the sources?
[01:55:05] <freem> the question is about debian's package building system, not about mpd's
[01:56:57] <sney> freem: if sphinxdoc needed to be explicitly enabled, you can just remove that part and it should disable 
[01:56:57] <freem> thanks
[01:56:57] <sney> but yes if it's autoconf usually --with and --without exist for each option
[01:57:23] <freem> mpd itself uses meson to build. I think this part is debian specific, dunno if debian relies on autotools to build

[05:54:53] <Blondie101010> can you stop the feed and benchmark the drive?

[05:55:31] <mattb0ne> this is NVe drive 
[05:55:37] <mattb0ne> cannot really get faster i would thing 
[05:55:41] <Blondie101010> if your feed is 10MB * 20 per second, then your drive would need to write at 200MB/s

[05:56:06] <mattb0ne> should be able to do that easily 
[05:56:13] <mattb0ne> right?
[05:56:26] <Blondie101010> that mentality prevents troubleshooting

[06:48:35] <Blondie101010> I thought you said your feed was going at 200MB/s..  if that were the case, it would take almost 3 hours to fill your drive
[06:49:06] <Blondie101010> better to show your output
[06:49:37] <Blondie101010> that will show the network, disk, and swap usage

[06:51:34] <Blondie101010> one thing we could see for instance is that the network shows more activity than the IO, which would confirm the feed is too heavy
[06:52:29] <Blondie101010> you're not converting/compressing one thing while another is capturing are you?

[07:06:34] <mattb0ne> no i tried that 
[07:06:46] <mattb0ne> i saw similar behavior when I did 
[07:07:11] <mattb0ne> i store 2 runs at a time on the drive 
[07:07:38] <mattb0ne> because i cannot run my compress script while running I try and wait until the end of the day to tod 
[07:07:43] <mattb0ne> to do that* 
[07:08:05] <mattb0ne> so I am holding a run at full size which is 800Gb 
[07:08:09] <mattb0ne> and then run another one 
[07:08:20] <mattb0ne> so that is how I get up in the disk usage.
[07:08:38] <mattb0ne> setting up another run I was trying to fake it but the system is not playing nice almost ready 
[07:10:24] <Blondie101010> well if the program is able to capture the full stream to disk, then it's performing sufficiently well for the feed, but of course the drive won't be usable by anything else
[07:12:14] <Blondie101010> mattb0ne:  is the data on the same drive as the OS?

[07:27:40] <mattb0ne> this dumb box only gives me 1 m.2 port
[07:28:05] <Blondie101010> well as I said, it's going sub-SATA speed so you can combine with SATA drives

[07:28:48] <mattb0ne> do you think moving the OS to a seperate physical drive would help ?

[07:30:04] <mattb0ne> I can get an expansion slot 
[07:30:06] <Blondie101010> it would make the system more usable when it's doing intense IO but would probably still be slow
[07:30:14] <mattb0ne> doh 
[07:30:33] <mattb0ne> what is the solution for io heavy applications
[07:31:01] <Blondie101010> increase the IO performance with RAID (or similar) is the obvious solution
[07:31:18] <mattb0ne> is that sending stuff to mulitple drives?
[07:31:32] <Blondie101010> yes
[07:31:38] <Blondie101010> RAID 0 is the most efficient, but without any protection

[07:32:10] *** cdown_ is now known as cdown
[07:32:40] <Blondie101010> 4 drives in RAID6 gives about 3 drives of space and 3 times the speed of a single drive, with protection, so it could endure a single disk failure

[07:34:15] <mattb0ne> unless they had a library where someone else does that for me 
[07:34:17] <Blondie101010> you can't code the drives to write faster

[07:45:48] <mattb0ne> the mystery will be solved

[10:37:38] <Marz> I mean debian
[10:39:28] <PMT> it does. what do you expect it to do?
[10:40:02] <Marz> you first have to fiddle with the source list 
[10:40:11] <PMT> yes, that's true.
[10:42:40] <PMT> it's been a bit, but last i knew, that was also the expected behavior on ubuntu, just possibly with a helper to make it easy to do.
[10:45:33] <TheBigK> do-release-upgrade is what u do in ubuntu.. but yeah.. its a helper to change the sources
[10:45:35] <alkisg> What's the error message of `apt full-upgrade` if you don't fiddle with the sources.list?
[10:45:49] <jelly> !dist-upgrade
[10:45:50] <dpkg> dist-upgrade tells apt to also install/remove packages when handling dependencies; security updates may require a dist-upgrade to install (they introduce new packages).  Dist-upgrade does not mean changing from stable to testing; apt and aptitude both call dist-upgrade "full-upgrade" to remove this confusion.  Read man apt-get carefully.  See also <why not dist-upgrade>, <full-upgrade>.
[10:46:31] <jelly> it's not a specific command for release upgrades to a new release; it never was
[10:47:29] <jelly> (it was used as an important step during release upgrades in the past)
[10:47:58] <PMT> (i thought full-upgrade was still in the steps in the release notes now?0

[10:53:18] <sgon> Hi, how to use apt to force install a pakcage and ignore any conflicting errors and replacing any existing files? Thanks a lot. 
[10:53:50] *** Joins: zepolen (~zepolen@37.6.200.207)
[10:54:20] <sgon> the existing files are from some other package. I want apt to replace them. Currently, it refused to replace them and failed. 
[10:58:42] *** Joins: palimaar (~oasd@KD113148020047.ppp-bb.dion.ne.jp)
[10:59:54] <jelly> sgon, that indicates a bug in one or both packages.  It would be better to repack one or the other without conflicting files, but if you can't do that,
[10:59:58] <jelly> !force-overwrite
[10:59:59] <dpkg> The reason you have been told to use --force-overwrite is because some packages in unstable are buggy and either have missing Conflicts: or contain files that they shouldn't. Check the BTS and make sure that a bug has been filed about the package in question (ask me about <bts>) then run dpkg -i --force-overwrite /path/to/.deb or apt-get -o DPkg::Options::="--force-overwrite" install <foopackagename>;
[11:00:18] <jelly> sgon, which debian release is this and which packages and versions?
[11:00:54] <sgon> jelly: it's not debian. It's my friend's ubuntu. He is new to linux and ask me what to do. I am pretty sure the override will work. 
[11:01:18] <jelly> sgon, then this is not the right channel to ask.  Use #ubuntu or maybe #linux
[11:01:23] <sgon> It's just a firmware. linux-firmware package has some bugs. 
[11:01:40] *** Joins: CJ- (~CJ-@2a01:7e00:e001:ee00:ea6f:38ff:fed3:f969)
[11:01:51] <sgon> it doesn't allow to install one firmware. It does not have that firmware files. but just refuse. 
[11:02:08] <sgon> the error shows the files will be replaced. But the truth is the files never exist. 
[11:04:07] <jelly> it's possible they are mixing and matching packages for different releases and some files have been shuffled around; but if it's not Debian I don't want to give advice that might be suboptimal or even create further problems down the line
[11:04:40] <sgon> this is actually the bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firmware-sof/+bug/1930868 
[11:04:53] <jelly> you can ask here if you can reproduce the same issue on actual Debian
[11:04:56] <sgon> just need to put some sof firmware files. that's all. 
[11:05:08] <sgon> debian does not have this problem. 
[11:05:53] <sgon> well, I didn't install linux-firmware
[11:08:56] <jelly> please avoid asking questions about Ubuntu installations in this channel in the future
[11:09:42] <sgon> OK. sorry. I am running debian. That's why I asked the question here. I don't have ubuntu. 
[11:09:43] <jelly> I don't know of a channel to ask "apt" questions that are not distro-specific, other than #linux
[11:10:12] <sgon> If I go to ubuntu channel, but I don't have it installed. That's weird. 
[11:10:54] <alkisg> sgon: what matters is the pc that has the problem, not how you connect to IRC...

[16:02:28] <asgas> What is the criteria for a package to be backported from testing to stable? Because krita 5.0 is just mere weeks or even days away from release and I was seriously hoping that you guys would backport it.
[16:02:56] <Haohmaru> iirc someone has to do it
[16:03:27] <PMT> yes, and it'd end up in bullseye-backports

[16:56:12] <Haohmaru> but i'm also using old computers, so i can't put an uber fancy gpu anyway, so i went for an AMD gpu which doesn't actually work in blender/cycles for the gpu rendering scheme, but works well in other CADs i use and also stuff like quake3

[21:17:38] <BCMM> is that documented anywhere other than the IRC bot?
[21:19:03] <jelly> the "apt" command is pretty much a work in progress, very new, only here with us the last four releases (~9 years)
[21:19:04] <greycat> Mailing list posts.  Probably some blogs or something.  I've never seen it in any man page.
[21:19:27] <PMT> the apt man pages are basically just there to pretend the commands are documented, AFAICT
[21:20:11] <PerfDave> I'm sure patches for the manpages would be welcome :)

[21:20:32] <jelly> sorry, apt(8)

[21:25:18] <sney> I submitted a patch to the refcard and it was accepted with no fuss. 
[21:26:18] <Urk> 01any thoughts on how I can downgrade my version of xfce  from xfce 4.12.5-1 to a slightly earlier version? I have determined that the latest update in xfce has toasted various display managers including LightDM, LXDM, sddm, etc, etc.  However, I was able to get LXDE to work flawlessly with sddm, and might consider going back to that if I can
[21:26:19] <Urk> figure out a way to customize a menu so that it looks like the icon tool bar in xfce4.01
[21:27:14] <jelly> xfce is made of many tiny parts
[21:27:14] <Urk> 01This seems to have also interfered with my ability to upgrade to Kernel 5.10 as well.  I have run several tests, and various debug routines http://paste.debian.net/1210047/.01
[21:27:21] <jelly> hmm

[21:28:55] <jelly> or possibly just black text that merely was not visible on _my_ black background
[21:29:02] <Urk> On my end it shows black text on white background.  I am using a web based IRC because my current version of XFCE4 will not allow me to run more than one window at a time.

[21:31:16] <Urk> Guess its Karma
[21:31:32] <jelly> Urk, not easily, but you COULD try upgrading the whole OS to Debian 11 and xfce 4.16-ish and see if the problem goes away
[21:32:10] <jelly> going back is in general hard to do, esp. when you have dozens of packages to downgrade
[21:32:32] <Urk> Upgrading to Debian 11 is what caused the problem.  It crashed, and I downgraded to kernel 4.19 with timeshift/rsync, but it retained the display manager problems that were evidenced in Debian 11.  Debian 11 doesn't work on my laptop without an awful lot of tinkering.
[21:32:47] <PMT> 4.12.5-1 does not seem to have existed in Debian?
[21:33:45] <Urk> Has anyone on here with a Dell XPS 15 7590 succesfully upgraded to Debian 11?  My undestanding is that there are still issues with my hardware configuration even though the firmware was out months ago, it isn't stable.
[21:33:56] <greycat> You should not have needed "timeshift/rsync" to boot the 4.19 buster kernel.  It should still have been on your system after the upgrade.  Just select it from the GRUB menu.
[21:34:21] <Urk> greycat:  Didn't work, and I tried it.  System went down
[21:34:51] <Urk> I had the same problem earlier in the year when I tried it so my next upgrade is going to be done in emulation mode first before doing the real thing.
