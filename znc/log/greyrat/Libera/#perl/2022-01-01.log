[00:18:21] <Mandevil> (that "Seeded..." thing is also wierd)
[00:18:44] <Grinnz> that's from you loading some Test::Builder based test module usually

[00:21:18] <Exodist> The seed
[00:21:22] <Mandevil> Ah
[00:21:48] <Grinnz> can you show the whole test file?
[00:21:56] <Mandevil> Sure
[00:22:02] <Exodist> It is from Test2::Plugin::SRand, which always seeds rand with the current date so that failues due to random behavior can be reproduced by using the date the test was run on

[00:24:55] <Mandevil> If I replace the inside of lives {} with nop, it passes.

[00:26:52] <Exodist> Or $@ is empty so the note is empty
[00:26:54] <Mandevil> Oh, sorry to hear that.
[00:27:28] <Exodist> I am vaccinated, but my girlfriend has already had a breakthrough case, and that's probably what I have, it sucks

[00:28:15] <Exodist> Test::more, and Test2 for compatibility always localize and restore $@
[00:28:43] <Grinnz> yes, but it's documented that you can use $@ after a lives that fails
[00:28:49] <Exodist> $@, $! And $?
[00:28:55] <Exodist> Yes, but not after an ok
[00:29:05] <Mandevil> Grinnz: https://apaste.info/SFPC
[00:29:09] <Grinnz> then the synopsis is not very useful :P

[00:29:21] <Grinnz> oh, $@ is not empty
[00:29:38] <Grinnz> i guess the note didn't work actually

[00:31:48] <Mandevil> Yes, diag shows the message OK.
[00:31:55] <Mandevil> It's behaving wierdly.
[00:32:12] <Grinnz> check after the test whether your tempfile got cleaned up
[00:32:29] <Grinnz> though if it didn't, tempfile should return a new one anyway, so i dunno
[00:32:48] <Mandevil> Strange.
[00:32:50] <Grinnz> anyway you want to use a tempdir for sqlite, since it will use more than one file
[00:33:14] <Mandevil> $ ls /tmp/*.sqlite|wc -l
[00:33:14] <Mandevil> 346
[00:33:18] <Mandevil> WTF this
[00:33:34] <Mandevil> The tempfiles are not getting deleted.
[00:33:37] <Grinnz> my $dir = tempdir; dbfile => "$dir/temp.db"
[00:34:07] <Grinnz> you also didn't scope your tempfile right, so it is going out of scope before you use it
[00:34:21] <Mandevil> Oh god!
[00:34:22] <Mandevil> Of course
[00:34:23] <Grinnz> no idea what's happening, use a tempdir instead and keep it in scope :P
[00:34:34] <Mandevil> I know.
[00:34:48] <Mandevil> The tempdire goes out of scope, but the filename is still used.
[00:34:53] <Mandevil> So it's non-temp file with the same name
[00:34:59] <Grinnz> aha, that makes sense
[00:35:55] <Mandevil> Oh! Also, the deterministic seeding made the filename always the same.
[00:36:11] <Mandevil> So it got reused.
[00:36:23] <Grinnz> i figured tempfile would not reuse it, but i guess it does
[00:36:44] <Grinnz> at least with the default template
[00:36:46] <Mandevil> It's not checking for collision.
[00:37:34] <Mandevil> Now things work ok after I fixed the mess.

[01:27:24] <Mandevil> Wonder if that feature works in DBD::SQLite.
[01:27:46] <Grinnz> it does, but it means you can only use one connection, as new connections will see a different database

[01:28:48] <Grinnz> not relevant to Test::Mojo, but it won't work with most mojo apps that expect to be able to retrieve new connections
[01:28:59] <Grinnz> :temp: will though
[01:29:44] <Mandevil> Grinnz: I'm only interested in this for testing.
[01:30:06] <Grinnz> yes, you're testing a mojo app
[01:30:25] <Mandevil> So why would there be multiple connections?
[01:30:39] <Grinnz> because there is likely more than one call to ->db in the codebase+test files
[01:31:02] <Mandevil> But shouldn't the connection be cached?
[01:31:29] <Grinnz> it can be but it's not guaranteed, and if you keep it in scope or fork it won't be
[01:31:38] <Mandevil> Hm.
[01:32:06] <Grinnz> the only safe way to use :memory: is if you only ever call ->db a single time and then use that $db for the rest of the program, and never fork
[01:32:15] <Mandevil> Well, what should I do to make this work? I'm at the end of my wits

[10:02:21] <gordonfish> Happy New Year!
[10:03:08] <gordonfish> Friend of mine on the east coast sent me a picture of an older atomic clock from the 1990s or maybe a little earlier, that changed to 1922 when it hit midnight...

[10:06:19] <gordonfish> I thought the y2k patch some did around the 90s pushed problem to 2020 (basically if y >= 0 && y < 20 then century is 20 else 19), not 2022, but I suppose different people did it differently.
