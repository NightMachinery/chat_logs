[00:41:14] <vivien> meraz_1, you need to do that each time you access the website. Also, npm is not known for its focus on reproducibility
[00:41:43] <meraz_1> vivien: Ooh, good point
[00:41:55] <jacobk> I think it's the same as with any executable binary file. Verifying that a binary or obfuscated code matches source code is hard, so it's safer to build yourself, but that doesn't mean the binary or obfuscated code is nonfree.
[00:42:28] <adfeno> Another trend coming lately is the "wget/curl and pipe to shell"
[00:42:30] <vivien> With binary code, you can know whether it changed from one time that you checked it to the next time
[00:43:03] <vivien> adfeno, that is what you do to compile any program.
[00:43:15] <vivien> Except there‚Äôs a Makefile in between.
[00:43:56] <adfeno> vivien: you mean this? : wget 'example.tld/nasty-or-random-script.sh' | sh -
[00:44:24] <vivien> If you do that, wget will save the script to a file
[00:44:38] <adfeno> Sorry indeed I forgot
[00:44:40] <vivien> You can run it with bash once downloaded
[00:44:56] <adfeno> wget -qO - url | sh -
[00:45:29] <adfeno> I have seen these come by, certainly unsafe.
[00:45:48] <vivien> There‚Äôs no obstacle to download it first and then run it, so any time you do that, you can also do wget url ; sh script.sh and it will be just as easy
[00:46:08] <adfeno> And lay person won't be able to inspect it unless they disarm/redo the command.
[00:46:13] <vivien> That‚Äôs not the case for web JS
[00:46:54] <adfeno> vivien: In this regard I agree, my example was indeed not the same as to web Js.
[00:48:12] <vivien> I understand that this parallel is sound because the web developer claims ownership of your computer, though.
[00:48:47] <jacobk> This article suggests a browser that treats JavaScript more like OSes treat binary files, where you have to explicitly "install" JS permanently before using it: https://freakspot.net/en/fix-or-kill-automatically-installed-JavaScript/
[00:49:21] *** Quits: tagomago (~anton@user/tagomago) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[00:49:22] <vivien> jacobk, in the early days of the web there was this thing called xml-catalog
[00:49:38] <vivien> Basically, it was a mechanism to use your own version for a resource on the web
[00:50:06] <vivien> But I guess it did not please the major web browser developers (microsoft then, and now google)
[00:50:31] <meraz_1> jacobk: Ooh that's cool, thanks for sharing
[00:51:27] <meraz_1> adfeno: Would this be a proper solution to the issue ‚Üí https://a.uguu.se//GhOfszn.jpg ? Adding a comment like that one at the beginning of the obfuscated js
[00:54:16] <vivien> Also, that issue will disappear if we achieve web interoperability. So, if an interoperable application is proprietary, you can reimplement it in the free world (not necessarily in JS). That‚Äôs the point of my work with Solid by the way

[01:01:18] <jacobk> vivien: What's Solid?
[01:05:39] <vivien> It‚Äôs a specification for how to separate applications and data. It‚Äôs fairly close to the current web architecture, but it‚Äôs in the spirit of ActivityPub. There are two way to describe the motivations: service providers need to ask you for the data (and not Facebook) so they like it, and since any client can use any data, we can make sure the applications are free software.
[01:06:52] <vivien> https://solidproject.org/ There‚Äôs a big name in it: https://solidproject.org/team

[01:08:02] <vivien> Of course, they don‚Äôt know much about free software, but I‚Äôll teach them :P
[01:09:12] <hypnotux> meraz_1, someone correct me if i'm wrong, but as per "Free your javascript" article, one can use tagged comments with the license or link the license through magnet links: https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/free-your-javascript.html#magnet-link-license
[01:10:18] <hypnotux> technically this would be the supported way of freeing the javascript of a page in a way LibreJS extension would accept
[01:10:48] <vivien> (basically, it‚Äôs easy for web 2.0 apps to implement interoperability, we just need the public to demand it)
[01:11:06] <meraz_1> hypnotux: Ohh true, that's a nice solution

[01:15:12] <jacobk> So Solid is kind of like OAuth, but with data storage in addition to authentication?
[01:18:46] <vivien> The problem with non-Solid OAuth is it‚Äôs not interoperable. As an application developer, you need to be authorized by the data silo to use it (and by the user if the silo cares enough). With Solid you just need the user‚Äôs authorization.
[01:20:43] <jacobk> How do you not need the Pod's authorization? What stops a pod from denying access just like an OAuth provider could?
[01:21:37] <jacobk> Or do you just mean there's a difference in defaults (i.e. not all Google OAuth authorizations allow gDrive access but all pod authorizations allow data storage)?
[01:21:38] <vivien> You can use another pod, because it‚Äôs interoperable :) You‚Äôre not forced to be on the same pod as your friends
[01:21:49] <vivien> (as opposed to Facebook)
[01:21:52] <jacobk> Oh I see
[01:22:48] <jacobk> So whereas now, an application developer has to know the Drive API, the OneDrive API and so on, with Solid application developers just need to know Solid's API.
[01:23:52] <vivien> Now, the application needs to promise Google, Twitter, Microsoft and so on that the app will be kind to them, otherwise the app won‚Äôt be able to access the data.
[01:25:42] <jacobk> If you only had your data in 1 pod, the same problem could occur, right (or the pod could just die)? So is putting the same data on multiple pods encouraged?
[01:26:18] <vivien> The secret is that the pod should be hosted as a free software server on a device you own under your domain name.
[01:27:14] <vivien> But yes, it‚Äôs possible to use different data pods for different kinds of data
[01:28:27] <vivien> The traditional example is you would have an identity on the pod of your employer for your business activities, and a personal pod for other things
[01:28:43] <vivien> That way the company can make sure your professionnal data are kept safe
[01:28:53] <vivien> (by whatever notion of safety your employer chooses)

[06:59:09] <tpefreedom> Not to mention all the different plugins/extensions/(whatever they are called for vscode or your program) that you would have to sift through with a program like this.
[06:59:35] <tpefreedom> So maybe a custom build and a site for free/libre plugins.

[14:08:19] <antilope> la_mettrie, there are only my speculations, but it seems really weird. reminding events from 40 years ago and to ostracize a person in such a way. who might be the interesant? may be the one who thinks his business is missing some money because of RMS

[14:12:35] <kilobug> antilope: well it's not just "events from 40 years ago", it's more a whole set of positions/attitude from RMS on certain topics (consent, attitude towards women, ...) that are rooted into nerd culture of the 70s are a bit out-of-touch with modern world; it's kinda sad because I've a lot of respect for all what RMS did for Free Software and how he has been the forebearer of that banner for so long, but I also 
[14:12:41] <kilobug> feel some his attitudes/declarations are harmful to the movement
[14:13:34] <kilobug> (and he personnally blessed a laptop of mine, in the early 2000s, which had absolutely no non-free software installed, which I'm childishly still proud of so many years later !)

[14:21:39] <leah> i thought that was all a done deal now
[14:23:03] <antilope> kilobug, these things he did had nothing to do with modern world. because, well, they took place in the past. let's judge ancient aztecs now for being cruel. furthermore, he obviously has some kind of austistic disorder. Aren't the SJWs supposed to protect him? And he listens to people, telling him he's doing wrong, and improves his attitude

[23:09:26] <scara> tpefreedom: Whats this meating thing? can others join?
[23:09:35] <ggoes> 16:00 EDT scara, and yes
[23:10:42] <tpefreedom> It's this public brainstorming meeting for the freedom ladder campaign.
[23:11:35] <zleap> yes
[23:11:41] <scara> Acording to duck duck go, this would be at night so I won't beable to make it. Will it be available as a video afterwards? Also what is the meeting about?
[23:12:08] <scara> Hm intresting, like how to manage free software?
[23:12:23] <zleap> Understanding encryption / Mobile phone freedom 
[23:12:31] <zleap> https://www.fsf.org/events/freedomladder-20210729-irc
[23:12:56] <zleap> scara, the meeting is on IRC, 
[23:14:16] <scara> Okay, will just beable to read it afterwards.
[23:14:36] <scara> I like this idea, I still use some nonfree software sadly :( (mainly games)
[23:14:52] <tpefreedom> What kinds of games?
[23:15:09] <tpefreedom> Some genres have more free software representation than others.
[23:15:16] <zleap> for me i like command and conquer (via snap)
[23:15:47] <zleap> i also like nethack vulture but the linux build for that died years ago) i can't just apt install it
[23:15:52] <scara> Minecraft and Krunker, I also have other games but thay aren't installed. I also have 5 other non free things acording to vrms https://ttm.sh/tTJ.txt
[23:16:25] <zleap> there is minetest (alternative to minecraft under a free license. I am guessing gpl but don't quote me on that)
[23:16:32] <scara> Oh also some games from itch.io but I have no clue what license thay're under
[23:16:37] <tpefreedom> scara, minetest with the mineclone2 mod
[23:16:47] <scara> Minetest is LGPL to my knowladge
[23:16:52] <zleap> ah ok
[23:17:24] <tpefreedom> scara, also probably install the mineclone2 mod for minetest
[23:17:34] <scara> I also found something called truecraft (https://github.com/ddevault/TrueCraft) whitch is a clear room implementation of b1.7.3 (I know, old)
[23:17:56] <tpefreedom> vanilla minetest is pretty barebones so you would likely want mods to expand on it
[23:19:13] <scara> I have minetest and I like it but what I do is minecraft depends 90% on servers and the other 10% is things I don't think minetest supports or atleast not 100% like redstone, command blocks (packs) and adventure maps (gotta love diversety) 
[23:19:37] *** Joins: MerchantOfVenice (~patrick@user/merchantofvenice)
[23:20:45] <scara> If there is a directory of alternative software, add classicube to it too, its also a old version of minecraft reverse enginerred, there are some unlikeable things though like no free login system
[23:21:21] <zleap> the free software directory is for GPL but there are some good websites that cover alternatives
[23:21:22] <scara> Someone could probably make a minecraft to minetest would converter?
[23:25:23] <scara> GPL is a law hack, the way I see it is if I have source code then I can do whatever I want even if the "owner" of the code doesn't approve
[23:25:44] <scara> Best thing is to get people to actually want software to be free
[23:25:53] <tpefreedom> scara, mineclone2 adds stuff like redstone
[23:26:23] <zleap> scara, by free do you mean free as in cost or free as in freedom
[23:26:33] <scara> I know, I have it installed but it just isn't the same but its been a while since I tested it, as I recall TFLOPS aren't possible
[23:26:40] <tpefreedom> zleap, the directory is for all free/libre software on gnu/linux, not just gpl
[23:26:46] <zleap> ah ok
[23:26:52] <zleap> thanks
[23:27:31] <scara> zleap: I mean as in freedom, if you have the code then you can change the software to do what you want, provided that you know how.
[23:28:55] <zleap> yeah

[23:29:53] <zleap> ok

[23:35:06] <scara> Ok, it works
[23:36:10] <scara> Guess its just one of those things where versions feal diffrent because not everything is exactly the same, like bugs and such
[23:39:17] *** Quits: atmoz (~atmoz@user/atmoz) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[23:40:14] <jacobk> Yeah, I feel like games are kind of like songs in that they usually don't have direct replacements (i.e. Mineclone doesn't replace Minecraft because the experience is different, and with games the point is the experience).
[23:40:50] <tpefreedom> stk is great though
[23:41:00] <scara> Whats stk?
[23:41:07] <tpefreedom> super tux kart
[23:41:48] <tpefreedom> I might not be a drop in replacement for mario kart or other proprietary kar racers, but it still does a great job representing the genre.
[23:42:01] <scara> I've played older versions of mario kart and I will say even here there are some diffrences (Note I played mario kart with a controller and tux kart with keyboard so...)
[23:42:07] <zleap> it depends on how open minded the player is
[23:42:39] <zleap> sure the games / software may not be exactly the same but if they do the job then they should be useable
[23:42:56] <scara> For me what I like is the small things that you never notice, like easter eggs and secret rooms
[23:43:30] <scara> zleap: yea sure if you're playing with someone else then the expirence should be pretty much the same
[23:43:53] <jacobk> The difference between games and tools IMO is that tools are a means to an end while games are the end.
[23:44:06] <jacobk> (in many cases)
[23:44:57] <scara> In any case I don't do the actuall game play part of games anyway, I
[23:45:03] <scara> 'm not much of a "gamer"
[23:45:28] <scara> Open worlds FTW!

[23:48:33] <tpefreedom> ?!
[23:48:58] <adfeno> scara: Minetest has mesecons, which replace redstones.
[23:49:12] <zleap> there are phones that respect freedom e.g pinephone
[23:49:26] <ggoes> we're not going to make the (false) claim that full mobile phone freedom is possible
[23:49:29] <ggoes> but it's important to mention
[23:50:05] <jacobk> scara: For servers, there's https://github.com/iceiix/stevenarella which tries to implement the protocal needed to connect to modern servers. I haven't had much luck with it myself though.
[23:50:07] <tpefreedom> adfeno, how?
[23:50:08] <ggoes> if you already use a cell phone and accept that inherent limitation on your freedom and privacy, there's no reason to avoid using free apps
[23:50:38] *** Joins: KUrare (~KUrare@user/kurare)
[23:51:03] <adfeno> adfeno: ggoes, to clarify, my comment on 5 was because of F-Droid.
[23:52:08] *** Joins: OMYasuda (~OMYasuda@189.79.67.44)
[23:52:12] <ggoes> ah, i see
[23:52:29] <scara> jacobk: Sorry what is this? Is it for minecraft or minetest? It Looks like protocolsupport / viaversions. Does this run on the client or server?
[23:53:08] *** Joins: rynn (~rynn@216.30.158.198)
[23:54:03] <jacobk> scara: It's for Minecraft, it's a client reimplementation so that you can connect to Minecraft servers with a paid account using only (as far as I know) free software.
[23:54:17] <adfeno> If we as activists can't foster non-free software expect for cases of directly help making a replacement or when the install would be a requirement to install a replacement of same category (even if not with same functions), I don't think F-Droid should be there.
[23:55:07] <tpefreedom> I'm still trying to parse that.
[23:55:24] <adfeno> https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/is-ever-good-use-nonfree-program.html
[23:55:42] <scara> jacobk: Hmm, I'll look at it but I don't seem to get it just yet

[23:56:15] *** Quits: KUrare (~KUrare@user/kurare) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[23:56:43] <jacobk> scara: You run stevenarella on your PC and then connect to Minecraft servers without the official Minecraft program, enabling you to play in the Minecraft ecosystem without using Mojang's nonfree software.
[23:57:44] <adfeno> scara: Re: Directory of software: https://directory.fsf.org/
[23:57:59] <ggoes> adfeno: we're aware f-droid has fsdg issues. but i think it's important to bear in mind that we're still at the level of recommending programs we wouldn't normally recommend, like firefox on a nonfree OS rather than icecat. getting people to use free apps from f-droid is the same situation. the repo does not have to be perfect, since at this stage, they're still getting started with free software
[23:58:12] <scara> So its a full clean room implementation of all the minecraft versions?
[23:58:43] <ggoes> as they become more committed, we should make them aware of that; if they're motivated by their freedom, they'll either move on to more freedom-respecting solutions or stop using a mobile until it's possible
[23:58:56] <jacobk> scara: yes, more or less
[23:59:25] <scara> I kind of don't belive it but I will give it a shot
