[00:07:34] <DoofusCan> mike18_: depends on what the code for the pipeline: basic steps plugin says about that method

[00:35:53] <programmerq> mike18_: I don't know whether the jenkins pipeline timeout sends a sigterm or not. I supposed it would depend on how you are invoking docker inside that timeout step. I imagine the answer might be different depending on whether you're using the jenkins docker plugin or calling the 'docker' cli from a shell script invoked by jenkins shell support.
[00:36:35] <programmerq> if the plugin does the equivalent of 'docker stop' on the container, it'd send a sigterm, wait for 10 seconds and then do a sigkill
[00:37:23] <programmerq> if it just sends a sigterm into the container but doesn't do a 'docker stop', then you'd need to make sure your containerized process properly handles the sigterm instead of ignoring it.
[00:37:41] <programmerq> there's just a lot of variables that you'd have to account for in order to characterize what's actually happening.

[17:12:13] <cluelessperson> tabakhase, in my case I have a network appliance that runs debian and I'm just attempting to run pihole on it,  but as to not interfere with it's stupid as hell network configuration,  I want to run pihole as it's own ip_address
[17:12:45] <cluelessperson> tabakhase, also, there are many cases where I want to separate network contexts and communication for containers.
[17:13:43] <cluelessperson> so I've set the macvlan parent to br103 and I'm not able to communicate in/out. :/
[17:13:46] <tabakhase> dns is udp, perfectly fine for published ports... - and to "seperate" things you can just add that additional IP on the host itself and "publish to that"
[17:15:23] <cluelessperson> tabakhase, and what you describe means altering the network configuration of the host, which I explicitly said I'm avoiding.
[17:16:08] * cluelessperson tries it anyway
[17:16:43] <cluelessperson> still, I don't know why this macvlan setup isn't working
[17:16:50] <cluelessperson> I also can't *tell* why it's not working
[17:19:13] <tabakhase> you already kinda "modify the host" by even setting up the macvlan network so thats somewhat of a mootpoint i feel... - edit in /etc/network/interfaces or via-docker is kinda the sameish - and for HA/failover/swarm/stack and there like its a whole nother direction again...
[17:21:35] <tabakhase> and the whys are plenty... or rather, the points where macvlan can fail are plenty, and without some networking-knowhow and fairly-fluent in tcpdump its a dirty nut to crack...
[17:22:28] <tabakhase> so there is also not much more advice to give than "verify your numbers/nets match, and then tcpdump around how far things go where", inside container, on host, on the cable, in the switch and back...
[17:23:49] <cluelessperson> tabakhase, the host is running 0.0.0.0:80  so it doesn't seem I can just add another ip address.

[17:31:07] <tabakhase> cluelessperson what on the host? possible to change that? - 3rd party you start? think there was some namespace magic that could "hide an ip"... -- also funky but "works", publish 8080, snag the 80 stuff up with iptables rule and dest-addr. and toss it back into prerouting to then match on the docker-alternative-port  (kinda fugly indeed :D) -- but yea, things running on the host already

[18:01:53] <deathbybandaid> I have 2 clusters of machines, primary cluster runs all the random stuffs, this other cluster is 2-node cluster just for these services that I run 2 instances of
[18:05:14] <tabakhase> deathbybandaid kinda offtopic, youre welcome in ##proxmox - but "2-node clusters" are not a thing (or everything just stops to function on the alive one when one node goes down as no quorum anymore) -- you either have a qdevice (like a raspberryPi or some vm on antoher cluster or whatever) -- or its "master+addon" (note, not backup or slave, but addon!)
[18:06:32] <tabakhase> and going back on goauthentik.io/docs -- that compose is a "simple all in one deployment" -- and while the github says authentik ITSELF can run stateless, it certainly has a statefull database. - 2building a HA postgress" is than rly its complete own separate story... 
[18:08:56] <tabakhase> deathbybandaid depending on "how hot" you need things replicated, you may just get away with running that all-in-one - and instead replicate the whole VM - and either "manually disaster recovery" (copy the conf file, and shoot the other node in the head) - or even use pve-HA (this works with zfs-replication on say a 15 minute schedule fairly decent if a 15-minute-old-backup is okay for example
