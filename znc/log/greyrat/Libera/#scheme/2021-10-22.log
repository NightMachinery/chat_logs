[00:40:38] <jcowan> At this point I am only a little more interested by the OS I am running as the manufacturer of the sockets in my walls.  OSes aren't *that* standardized, but  they are standardized enough for me.
[00:46:01] <Zipheir> I'm not all that interested in the running OS anymore, either, and tinkering with kernels and userspace has taken up way too much of my time in the past.  I do appreciate knowing whether the manufacturer of the sockets gave me a non-broken TLS implementation, though.
[00:46:36] <Zipheir> And that they aren't phoning-home "anonymous" telemetry to someone every few seconds.
[00:57:02] <mario-goulart> gwatt: I actually use Linux on a Macbook.  Surprisingly, Linux runs better on the Macbook than on my personal thinkpad.  Everything works flawlessly on the Macbook, including the S3 state of suspend.

[01:00:24] <mario-goulart> Admittedly, my thinkpad is a bit of an oddball for Linux.  It's a x1 tablet, first generation.  Works well but not great.
[01:11:34] <jcowan> Cute little story: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-10-19/nz-police-111-emergency-call-4-year-old-toys/100551146
[01:18:43] <mario-goulart> Cute indeed. :-)
[01:23:35] <Zipheir> They don't make Thinkpads like they used to.  But businesses retire them by the hundreds, so they're usually cheap.
[01:24:18] <Franciman> ahahahah
[01:24:22] <Franciman> jcowan: so nice
[01:24:33] <Franciman> he did have cool toys
[01:24:58] <Franciman> we could not get this in italy, because we have actual crime going on
[01:25:31] <Franciman> these things make the police well-wanted , though
[01:25:37] <webshinra> (I have a T 540p of which I'm pretty happy)
[01:25:37] <Franciman> now the boy will like police forever
[01:25:41] <Franciman> until he gets a teenager
[01:25:56] <Franciman> no ACAB for him, I guess
[01:43:24] <jcowan> Note the request for a _spare_ officer, one who is not currently committed to anything.

[20:47:48] <amazigh> like ants, there should be always someone doing nothing in case something terrible happens ;)
[20:48:36] <amazigh> actually in ants colony that is a large amount of the population IIRC more than 10% of ants to just roam idle inside their house or around it.
[20:49:23] <amazigh> rudybot: ant colonies forms durable civilizations
[20:49:24] <rudybot> amazigh: how old are the pants. i want to know how durable they are
[20:49:32] <amazigh> meh
[20:49:52] <amazigh> dpk: I wanted to ask what CPU architecture do you target with your secret Scheme?
[20:50:04] <dpk> my secret Scheme?
[20:50:18] <amazigh> oh you do not work on Scheme implementation?
[20:50:23] <dpk> i was briefly working on what would have been a compiler for aarch64
[20:50:33] <dpk> however, that's slipped down the to-do list
[20:50:42] <amazigh> no worries. why the choice of aarch64?
[20:51:10] <dpk> because i find the architecture nice
[20:51:53] <amazigh> I ask the question, outside the mere social aspect of it, I am interested to know better the rationale, to possibly help me in my own choice / choices
[20:51:56] <amazigh> hmm.
[20:51:58] <amazigh> ok
[20:52:18] <dpk> my 'current' Scheme implementation project (if i could be said to have one at all, as i haven't touched this one in weeks either, and didn't get much beyond writing a CPS converter) is a proof-of-concept toy Scheme to JavaScript compiler called sj0
[20:52:59] <amazigh> interesting, I could possibly take a look at it, in particular the cps converter, maybe a question will suffice: do you use a trampoline?
[20:53:33] <amazigh> like the JS side, the callstack is never more than trampoline function, and a slice of scheme procedure?
[20:54:37] <dpk> no, my original plan was to catch stack overflows (which can be done interoperably, in the sense of writing three different catches for V8, Safari, and Firefox), and start again from the bottom of the stack when they happen, like Chicken does in C
[20:54:52] <amazigh> that's is how my scheme->javascript and scheme->wasm works (it is very slow)
[20:54:57] <amazigh> nice trick !
[20:55:07] <dpk> (of course, technically not necessary to do that in Safari which now has proper CPS anyway)
[20:55:13] <amazigh> yup
[20:55:19] <amazigh> never tried it tho.
[20:56:27] <amazigh> I revisiting the *idea* of a / the compiler tower such as described by nanopass, but I want to make it work both ways, so that it is bootstrappable

[20:57:04] <dpk> however, the fragility of the stack overflow catch, plus issues around 'FFI' (which turned out to be more needed more frequently than i initially thought, mainly due to JS constructors), has made me consider if i could instead try something more reliable: explicitly counting the stack frames and bouncing back down when it reaches, say, 1000 or some number significantly lower than the recursion limit of any JS implementation
[20:57:14] <dpk> i'll investigate further
[20:58:18] <amazigh> interesting.
[20:59:03] *** Quits: turlando (~turlando@user/turlando) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[20:59:24] <amazigh> what nanopass (and others) do, is they have an object language called Scheme, that they derive into several pseudo meta languages, that may not have an eval procedure associated with them (hence the pseudo), until the target language in the case of Chez that is some kind of assembly, in the case of Gambit C but also some assemblies.
[21:00:15] <amazigh> this idea is related to LISP-3, and reflection in the sense of LISP-3

[21:01:12] * dpk wonders now she mentions it how many function calls Chicken typically manages before bouncing the stackÂ â€¦
[21:01:32] <amazigh> for the time being, I am wondering whether I can design from a target language, build a set a mini meta languages, upon which I can build a more featured Scheme.
[21:02:41] <amazigh> My immediate target language would be some kind of RISC, so here is the question, what is the best software material to play with RISC or RISC-like instruction set?
[21:03:00] <amazigh> RISCV 
[21:04:37] <dpk> yeah, as i say, sj0 falls definitely in the category of 'toy Scheme implementations', no RnRS support aimed for. only data types were symbols (JS strings), numbers (JS floats), pairs, and the empty list/true/false constants (JS null, true, and false respectively). internally has unhygienic macros purely to desugar let into lambda, etc. it's a proof-of-concept for this compiler technique, nothing more

[21:08:33] <amazigh> what aarch64 emulator, if any, did you use? is it running on bare metal or there is os?
[21:12:19] <dpk> Linux on a Raspberry Pi4
[21:12:44] <dpk> but i didn't actually get to the point of having running Scheme code
[21:13:08] <leah2> i only looked a bit, but there's no rNrs-portable scribble/scribe reader is there?
[21:13:09] <gwatt> I've used qemu to play around with aarch64.
[21:13:37] <dpk> leah2: Chibi's implementation probably works on other R7RSes, let me checkÂ â€¦
[21:13:47] <leah2> oh chibi has one? how did i miss it?
[21:14:07] <dpk> yep, (chibi scribble) on http://snow-fort.org/pkg
[21:14:19] <dpk> though actually installing it on a different Scheme might be a bit of a pain
[21:14:29] <leah2> well i'm targeting chibi anyway :D
[21:14:38] <dpk> ah! :D
[21:14:44] <leah2> perfect, let me look at it
