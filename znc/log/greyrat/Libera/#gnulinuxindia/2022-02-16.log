[07:11:11] <Zbnssn[m]> yep most times

[07:39:50] <iamak[m]> Yeah. ScrambledExif ftw
[07:40:56] <iamak[m]> Is waydroid the proton equivalent for Android?
[07:44:11] <dakship[m]> iamak[m]: yea

[07:44:22] <dakship[m]> > <@iamak:matrix.org> Is waydroid the proton equivalent for Android?
[07:44:23] <dakship[m]>  * yea
[07:44:23] <dakship[m]> like anbox which works on wayland too
[07:48:29] <iamak[m]> Anbox is heavy in my experience
[07:48:41] <iamak[m]> It's like a vm
[07:49:00] <iamak[m]> It has it's own interface and all
[07:49:23] <iamak[m]> With Wine/Proton you don't even realise you're running it under the hood
[07:49:28] <iamak[m]> (Kudos to the devs)
[08:56:55] <dakship[m]> yeah. Wine doesn't emulate while anbox does, or something like that
[08:56:55] <dakship[m]> said yes since the result was similar

[11:50:20] <nu> hello
[11:50:30] <AryaK[m]> also you can gpg encrypt your notes
[11:51:13] <nu> have any guide about that?
[11:51:16] <AryaK[m]> and everytime you open the file with vim or whatever, you can unencrypt automatically and use
[11:51:30] <AryaK[m]> nu: no but it shouldnt be too hard
[11:51:40] <nu> does matrix useres get notified when somone joins irc
[11:51:56] <nu> ok, i'll try
[11:52:48] <AryaK[m]> yes they do
[11:55:06] <gtlsgamr> nu: relejek[m]: Personally I just use Joplin for notes. It also has E2EE.
[11:55:20] <smud[m]> <dakship[m]> "I'll drop my site here too C..." <- Damn I feel old, and I'm not even 30 :p
[11:55:21] <AryaK[m]> just gpg encrypt notes
[11:55:57] <AryaK[m]> or another way to do it is to make a git hook so git only gets encrypted files
[11:56:05] <AryaK[m]> there is also git-crypt but i havent looked into it
[11:56:58] <AryaK[m]> wow just realized how outdated my website is

[11:57:14] <smud[m]> Nice, is there a pattern/structure you follow to maintain notes? Or just plop them in files?
[11:57:40] <nu> AryaK[m] i thought you were talking about irc encryption
[11:57:45] <nu> i already use luks
[11:58:03] <gtlsgamr> relejek[m]: try to find a way to organize these notes.
[11:58:18] <gtlsgamr> your post doesn't really shed light on that part/. It could make it mroe interseting
[11:58:26] <gtlsgamr> more interesting*
[11:59:23] <AryaK[m]> nu: lol.
[11:59:30] <AryaK[m]> i was talking about notes in the cloud
[11:59:56] <nu> the tls encryption irc use is not e2e? librea can see all our chats right?

[12:03:28] <JB[m]> really loved his workflow
[12:04:32] <smud[m]> I'm contemplating using obsidian, it has vim mode, and even if I don't use it directly, it can still visualize connections in my notes
[12:05:39] <JB[m]> smud[m]: Imma give it a shot as well
[12:05:39] <JB[m]> would really appreciate those plugins in joplin
[12:06:41] <gtlsgamr> JB[m]: yes self hosting joplin.
[12:07:30] <gtlsgamr> I use joplin to keep track of expenses
[12:07:41] <gtlsgamr> and as a scratch pad and list place
[12:10:10] <AryaK[m]> obsidian is proprietary right
[12:11:04] <gtlsgamr> it is yesa

[12:13:21] <relejek[m]> <gtlsgamr> "relejek: try to find a way to..." <- yeah. i wrote that post when i was getting into that system. i purposefully didn't share "how i do it" to keep the post light. kind of a foreshadowing for another "how to" post. i'll make that soon.

[12:22:16] <gtlsgamr> very
[12:22:53] <AryaK[m]> its encrypted anyway
[12:23:15] <smud[m]> There's no proof of anyone breaking PGP, so I think it's somewhat safe

[12:24:04] <gtlsgamr> lmao
[12:24:06] <gtlsgamr> nice
[12:24:43] <relejek[m]> gtlsgamr:  Joplin and obsidian are really, really good. and i have used them. only thing is for me i needed something super light and fast to add my thoughts. and both of above apps have a pretty heavy GUI for linux - they use electron, i guess. so i decided to go with vim in pc and markor app in android (nothing gets lighter and faster than that) and i wanted seamless sync between pc-andoird syncthing provided me that. as i already
[12:24:43] <relejek[m]> use it for other stuff. no need to setup another app.
[12:24:43] <AryaK[m]> thankfully it didnt havea anything private other than me trying to livestream with ffmpeg and configuring kitty
[12:26:21] <relejek[m]> Arya K:  it is fine PGP is encrypted and it is highly unlikely that someone with great resources is targeting your pass-backup on a highly secure server. just make sure nothing is in plain-text.
