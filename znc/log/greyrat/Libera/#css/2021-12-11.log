[07:18:44] <up_running> Let’s say you have a Firefox webpage you’re viewing with a lot of bold text in red. I opened Developer Tools and went to Inspector.
[07:18:50] <up_running> There, I searched for #ff0000, which is the color red. After that, I went to the “This Element” area on the right and unclicked the box for the color #ff0000.
[07:18:55] <up_running> My problem is there are about 78 elements like this on the page and I was thinking there has to be a better way than just manually unchecking all 78 boxes.
[07:19:00] <up_running> I'm hoping to find a solution via Console.
[07:19:07] <up_running> Here’s the link for a visual:

[07:19:29] <up_running> I did notice though that what is happening is this:
[07:19:35] <up_running> before I click the element button =>  "color: #ff0000;"
[07:19:39] <up_running> after I click the element button => "/*! color: #ff0000; */"

[09:14:11] <MrBurns> Anyone awake?
[09:15:45] <Rockwood> which one you want to centre?
[09:16:59] <MrBurns> the white boxes. two in a row
[09:17:41] <camelCase> replace justify-content with text-align: center;
[09:18:27] <camelCase> in button
[09:19:14] <MrBurns> camelCase: Thanks! replacing justify-content with text-align: center; in .singup did it!
[09:19:15] <camelCase> span rather
[09:19:22] <camelCase> ok
[09:20:13] <MrBurns> I just spent about 3 hours trying everything else :'D
[09:20:18] <camelCase> your dev tools should tell you "justify-content has no effect on this element since it’s neither a flex container nor a grid container."
[09:21:35] <MrBurns> Well I recently "in my rage" uninstalled vscode and using nano again :)
[09:21:54] <camelCase> I mean the dev tools in your browser
[09:22:27] <up_running> Anyone have any idea about my question above?
[09:22:33] <camelCase> the document inspector
[09:22:44] <MrBurns> Should propably watch some tutorial on how to use that properly
[09:23:40] <camelCase> up_running: what's the question?
[09:24:10] <up_running> camelCase: I'll post it again. One second, please.
[09:24:22] <camelCase> actually, please don't repeat yourself
[09:24:39] <up_running> oh, ok. it's above then if you scroll up.
[09:24:42] <camelCase> is your question "how do I set the colour for all 78 elements to inherit rather than red?"
[09:25:16] <up_running> camelCase: I want all the #ff0000 element color boxes unchecked
[09:25:32] <up_running> I know there is a way to do this in Console with a short script
[09:25:38] <up_running> i'm just unsure of how to write it.
[09:25:40] <camelCase> i would say try starting with span[style='color: #ff0000;']{color: inherit !important}
[09:25:48] <camelCase> if you want to add a rule in CSS
[09:26:00] <camelCase> otherwise you can use javascript to strip the CSS from those problem elements
[09:26:25] <up_running> I'll try your above suggestion on a new page and see what happens.
[09:26:29] <camelCase> as you've seen, the checkboxes in developer tools functionally just alter the elements by commenting things out
[09:26:41] <up_running> yes, that's all I want to do
[09:27:10] <Rockwood> camelCase, its also part of css programming naming
[09:27:13] <camelCase> why don't you just find and replace the text then?
[09:27:17] <up_running> so, basically just add `/*! */` to the relevant #ff0000 areas
[09:27:34] <camelCase> Rockwood: what is?
[09:27:48] <camelCase> up_running: or remove them completely
[09:28:06] <up_running> camelCase: how can do I find and replace in someone else's page code?
[09:28:19] <camelCase> userscripts
[09:28:32] <up_running> well, actually, let me try your initial code first and report back.
[09:28:34] <camelCase> so you'll have to do it in javascript as I suggested, I thought this was your own code
[09:28:52] <camelCase> yes my first method will do it via CSS, so you could use a plugin like stylebot or stylus
[09:29:08] <camelCase> second method in javascript will require something like greasemonkey or tampermonkey
[09:29:40] <up_running> Is there a way to do it just via Console in Document Inspector without any addons?
[09:29:48] <up_running> I'd like to keep it as simple as possible.
[09:29:59] <camelCase> sure, if you know javascript
[09:30:18] <camelCase> you can add css rules via the document editor as easily as you can enter a line of javascript into the console
[09:30:22] <up_running> I do know a bit of JS, but not too much
[09:31:40] <up_running> camelCase: the span code in your first suggestion didn't work
[09:31:57] <up_running> It yield "Uncaught SyntaxError: unexpected token: '{'"
[09:32:33] <camelCase> did you put it into the console?
[09:32:37] <up_running> yes
[09:32:48] <up_running> I can share a screenshot if needed
[09:32:54] <camelCase> no it's fine, wait a sec
[09:33:02] <camelCase> see this screenshot? https://i.imgur.com/RhEOi2h.png
[09:33:29] <up_running> Yes, I see it.
[09:33:41] <camelCase> under where it says adblock plus, you've got a style filter and "pseudo elements" and below it all the styles that apply to what you've selected
[09:33:56] <camelCase> on that top line with "filter style" there's a +
[09:34:03] <camelCase> you can use that to add the rule
[09:34:15] <camelCase> span[style='color: #ff0000;']{color: inherit !important}
[09:34:20] <camelCase> that will apply it to the page
[09:34:48] <camelCase> or you can edit the html and add <style>span[style='color: #ff0000;']{color: inherit !important}</style> somewhere

[09:42:44] <up_running> camelCase: The second option worked! Thank you!

[21:31:25] <teut> I was telling my friend what does a flexbox do. So I told him that if you got a row with 4 columns ( i.e., a div with 4 child divs) then it will wrap.  I said that consider desktop width is 1000px and he has set each child of 250px then all of them will be in a row. But then I got confused. Even on mobile it would be 1000px since px is abstract
[21:31:26] <teut> unit so why would there be wrapping?
[21:34:28] *** Joins: dpuerto (~dpuerto@136-27-83-52.cab.webpass.net)
[21:37:41] <hmw[at]> px is not THAT abstract
[21:38:21] <hmw[at]> it is more or less defined as a certain size of a dot as seen from a given distance to the screen, according to dpi and whatnot

[21:40:22] <teut> does 1pxx depends on viewport size?
[21:40:26] <teut> px*
[21:41:29] <teut> i m on desktop with browser maximized , if I squeeze browser to half will the value of 1px used in css of this website https://web.libera.chat/ change?
[21:42:39] <hmw[at]> teut: px size should not change
[21:43:04] <teut> but viewport size would actually change
[21:43:24] <teut> oh viewport size is also in pixels

[22:54:50] <michigan> I'm at a loss for words - this is beautiful
