[00:01:10] *** Joins: Joanna (uid57472@id-57472.lymington.irccloud.com)
[00:02:06] <jan6> and HERE came in the J who owns the place, I guess
[00:03:34] <Joanna> Hi everyone
[00:04:21] <Joanna> Hi Roey I’m back
[00:04:51] <Roey> Joanna: hello hello!!!
[00:04:52] <Roey> SO
[00:04:55] <Roey> spiderman: meet Joanna
[00:04:58] <Roey> Joanna: meet spiderman 
[00:05:04] <Roey> you guys both know linux
[00:05:11] * jan6 meets everyone behind their backs
[00:05:31] <Roey> Joanna, I told spiderman that you place a big emphasis on segregating duties among different machines, even for private computing
[00:06:05] <Joanna> It’s a simple solution for sure
[00:06:16] <Roey> Joanna: it just fascinated me what you said yesterday here
[00:06:45] <Joanna> Oh ? I thought it was a fairly common practice
[00:07:57] <spiderman> hey, I've done a linux or two here and there
[00:08:13] <jan6> containerization based on general task (like "personal", "work", "banking" etc) is common enough, I think, running full on separate VMs for everything I think only very few people bother to deal with
[00:08:19] <spiderman> home vlans is pretty hardcore IMO
[00:08:38] <Joanna> It wouldn’t be good for developers who like to copy code off the internet though to isolate development machine from internet
[00:09:06] <Roey> <jan6> containerization based on general task (like "personal", "work", "banking" etc) is common enough, I think, running full on separate VMs for everything I think only very few people bother to deal with <- yet now I know at least two people off of this IRC network who do exactly this
[00:09:16] <Roey> and that it save done of them whn one of their VMs got hacked all the way to DOM0
[00:10:18] <jan6> there comes a point when just having separate computers is better than a ton of VMs ;P
[00:10:27] <Joanna> How did it get hacked?
[00:10:48] <jessicara> true
[00:11:24] <jessicara> even being compromised aside, it's real scary to boot the windows 10 vm to play games
[00:11:38] <jessicara> losing control of the host passing all input to the guest
[00:11:48] <jessicara> where it may or may not go wrong during the process
[00:12:15] <Joanna> I refuse all windows past 7
[00:12:31] <jessicara> i would, if there was drivers for windows 7
[00:12:41] <jessicara> only 10 onwards
[00:12:52] <jan6> scary why? if you don't switch between another VM or window, I wouldn't think that there could be any input leaks at all
[00:12:55] <jessicara> 1660ti is too new apparently
[00:13:24] <jessicara> scary because it's entirely possible to get stuck with an unbootable windows 10, where control of the host is lost to shut it down even
[00:13:36] <Roey> <Joanna> How did it get hacked? <- he said they hacked his irc client
[00:13:37] <Roey> first.
[00:13:37] <Joanna> My days of playing computer games are over luckily
[00:14:08] <Roey> ;)
[00:14:09] <jessicara> i also forget how to power off from the efi shell
[00:14:18] <Roey> Joanna: yet you also do this multiple VMs dance
[00:14:20] <jan6> efi shell is a weird beast
[00:14:20] <Joanna> Roey: how did they hack irc client?
[00:14:23] <jessicara> which is what got control back about 3 times ago
[00:14:25] <Roey> I'm trying to ask him now
[00:14:34] <jessicara> the other 2 times found an old mouse to connect to the host
[00:14:52] <jessicara> because that wouldn't be passed through and would temporarily become the main one
[00:15:32] <jessicara> yeah this would be fine with a spare keyboard
[00:16:03] <Roey> ookay
[00:16:15] <Joanna> In general I trust mechanical things more that software things. So disconnecting wire to internet is more trustworthy than turning off wifi
[00:16:20] <Roey> Joanna: yeah, I invited him over here; he's "ferret", if he comes in
[00:16:25] <jessicara> generally yeah
[00:16:27] <Roey> Joanna: ahh
[00:17:41] <Joanna> After gaming for many years I really don’t trust software
[00:18:05] <Joanna> Not even my own
[00:18:44] <jan6> my philosophy is always "can't fully trust anything that doesn't have a physical off switch" ;P
[00:18:49] <Joanna> There seems to be a very bad trend to control everything with software
[00:19:09] <jan6> doesn't mean I care to do anything about it, but a potentially-always-on thingy is just scary
[00:19:36] <Joanna> Even faucets in bathrooms are electronically controlled now it’s ridiculous
[00:19:45] <jan6> lolwut
[00:19:51] <jan6> THAT is ridiculous
[00:20:07] <jessicara> yeah it is getting ridiculous
[00:20:18] <jan6> likw what, "alexa make the water warmer" or why's that even a thing
[00:20:37] <Joanna> Alot of toilets need electricity to flush too
[00:20:39] <jan6> or you want touch-control water heat?
[00:21:22] <jan6> I'm not sure if they need electricity to FLUSH, I think they generally just need it to pump water back in the reservoir
[00:22:18] <Joanna> In general a lot of rather important things are being automated and connected to the internet no doubt because someone wants to save money
[00:24:49] <Joanna> Cell phones without removable batteries can only be turned off by depleting the battery or maybe a faraday cage
[00:25:35] <Roey> <Joanna> After gaming for many years I really don’t trust software ,- ah
[00:27:27] <Joanna> Games have exploits both favorable and unfavorable
[00:29:01] <Joanna> I found ways to get around the rules because the people programming the game were not so familiar with it

[01:01:27] <Joanna> The robot toilet is just a remake of an old technology called the bidet.. personally I would prefer a simple floor toilet because I’m the one who has to clean it. Smart phones have turned people into zombies who fall into fountains and worse while transfixed by their phones

[01:02:33] <Joanna> I mean mesmerized by phone
[01:02:35] <jessicara> i tried, getting bumped around just by walking can't unlock it
[01:02:42] <jessicara> so give up and never use it while walking/etc
[01:03:20] *** Joins: phenom (~primus@user/phenom)
[01:03:44] <Joanna> They have taken long walks on short piers . jessicara you just aren’t addicted enough :)

[01:04:33] <jessicara> i'm guessing they are doing more than one thing wrong
[01:04:49] <Joanna> People have fallen onto train tracks I’m pretty sure whilst staring at phones
[01:04:50] <jessicara> not having a password so they don't need to poke accurately many times to unlock
[01:04:53] <jan6> I've never understood neither walking with a phone (unless you're quickly looking up something (quickly being "done in the next half-minute")) nor people who meditate on a toilet or play toilet-games, lol
[01:05:45] <Joanna> They are addicted and can’t put the thing down..
[01:06:29] <Joanna> Texting, playing games, surfing the Internet. Who knows..

[01:06:52] <Joanna> Probably on social media or reading email.
[01:08:05] <Joanna> People I know try to bring their toys to the dinner table if they can get away with it.
[01:08:24] <jan6> duh
[01:08:37] <jan6> why eat, when you can eat *AND* do something
[01:08:47] <phasmatodea> toilet-games is a weird word for jacking off
[01:09:04] <jan6> lol
[01:09:05] <jan6> nah
[01:10:03] <phasmatodea> if i go into the toilet for 15 mins and bring my phone, well lets just say i dont have any mobile games installed
[01:10:22] <jan6> then you play browser games, simple ;P'

[01:11:07] <Joanna> Getting rid of sit down toilets would solve the problem of people lingering in the bathroom.
[01:11:22] <jan6> it wouldn't solve it
[01:11:40] <jan6> it would prolly set time limits tho
[01:12:08] <Joanna> They would not have a chair so they would not stay
[01:12:31] <jan6> *sit
[01:12:37] <jan6> ;P
[01:12:48] <Joanna> Before phones they liked to read books in there
[01:18:39] <spiderman> so how did you kids get into security? I would love to be more secure at work and home, but I can seem to find a way to give a shit. I've never been pwned
[01:19:55] <jan6> lol
[01:20:01] <jan6> you could start pwning yourself
[01:23:11] <jan6> I guess you can play around with the "hack this box" kinda CTF challenges (basically "there's a "flag" code, go figure out how to get it, here's a hint if you need it", the challenges can be very varying, some are terminal programs, some are vulnerable web apps, sometimes there's incorrect permissions, etc)
[01:39:56] <spiderman> I used to do ctfs, but they got harder as I progressed
[01:39:59] <spiderman> :D
[01:42:30] <jan6> that's the point ;P
[01:48:23] *** Joins: tangy (~tangy@user/tangy)
[01:54:12] <Joanna> spiderman: I’m curious how did you find our channel?
[01:55:51] <spiderman> well, I am a big fan of cespo, the cartoon character, so I entered his name in backwards and landed in this channel
[01:56:17] * Hydragyrum notes the invite-only flag on the channel
[01:56:42] <Hydragyrum> or did that get changed?
[01:57:20] <Joanna>  spiderman Just to let you know this channel is for programmers and security professionals
[01:57:41] <spiderman> ok
[01:57:54] <Joanna> Hydragyrum: I don’t think it’s invite only
[01:57:55] <spiderman> I'll have you know I'm an infrastructure engineer
[01:58:03] <spiderman> Roey: told me to come here
[01:58:50] <Joanna> What does infrastructure engineering entail ?
[01:59:08] <spiderman> I run the infra for a small handful of medium-sized websites
[01:59:16] <spiderman> webservers, databases, deployments, etc
[01:59:38] <spiderman> kinda sorta devops
[02:00:01] <Hydragyrum> oh it's just that it needs a regged nick
[02:00:07] <Hydragyrum> mb
[02:00:08] <Joanna> Hydragyrum: mode is +gnat
[02:00:21] <spiderman> shows +gnrt for me
[02:00:26] <Joanna> gnrt
[02:00:36] * spiderman doesn't understand channel modes
[02:00:39] <Joanna> Spell checker did that
[02:01:35] <Joanna> spiderman: were you on freenode also before the big move ?
[02:01:55] <spiderman> yes, but not active. I started actively posting in libera back in May
[02:02:38] <Joanna> Why not active on freenode? Lots of good channels back then
[02:03:05] <jan6> are there not lots of good channels now, on libera?
[02:03:36] <Joanna> What are your favorite channels?
[02:04:13] <Joanna> Many people I know got lost on the way to libera unfortunately
[02:05:16] <jan6> I'm only on some 20 channels now, nearly none of which are talk channels, lol
[02:06:08] <Joanna> Nobody talks ?
[02:06:10] <spiderman> I used to work for a nonprofit that hosted a support channel on freenode, which is why I was on there. I heard the drama about freenode, and that got me talking on freenode, and eventually libera. I'm enjoying my stay now
[02:06:49] <spiderman> I'm mostly on #python, #reddit-sysadmin and #ansible
[02:06:57] <spiderman> sometimes #linux, but those people suck
[02:07:11] <jan6> either nobody talks (most of them), or nobody talks off-topic (like #posix or #bash, are almost always on-topic and dealing with problems, not chatting about)
[02:07:11] <Joanna> Oh ? I didn’t know nonprofits used irc .Was it a well known non profit?
[02:07:23] <spiderman> foss nonprofit
[02:07:28] <spiderman> we provided hosting to foss projects
[02:07:48] <jan6> fosshost?
[02:08:10] <spiderman> I'm not sure if I want to identify which one, it is small, but high-impact (~200 projects supported)
[02:08:13] <Joanna> jan6: that’s really frustrating when channels are dead. Like #firebird or #delphi for instance
[02:08:37] <jan6> ah that's also a problem, but I usually don't tend to need those channels
[02:09:08] <jan6> and even quiet channels often do respond....uh...some 10 hours later, when someone bothers to check in, lol
[02:09:17] <Joanna> The best channel I know of in terms of quality and activity is #postgresql
[02:09:32] <spiderman> the issue I find is the most talkative channels are either super on-topic, or filled with assholes
[02:09:45] <Hydragyrum> (inb4 #security)
[02:10:09] * Hydragyrum selfbanned from #security
[02:10:13] <Joanna> It depends upon who is moderating the channels what becomes of them
[02:10:19] <jan6> not only
[02:10:33] <spiderman> I was banned for a day in #linux for saying something like lol or btw
[02:10:34] <jan6> if you do get a ton of help requests then you just don't have time to chat in there, also
[02:10:51] <Joanna> Hydragyrum: it still says you are security staff though :)
[02:10:52] <jan6> that sounds like mounting on top of something, spiderman 
[02:10:59] <Hydragyrum> I still have my op flag there
[02:11:16] <Hydragyrum> but I'm banned until I unban myself
[02:11:48] <Hydragyrum> after electr0n flipflopped on the apachez issue, I don't really want to be there
[02:12:15] <Joanna> There are some smart people in security but I have the people who talk most on ignore so it seems rather quiet most of the time
[02:13:33] <Joanna> Hydragyrum: most people are complacent and that’s the problem. My philosophy is that channel ops are responsible for channel members.
[02:14:18] <jan6> and channel members are responsible to channel ops, a little bit, too ;P
[02:14:54] <Hydragyrum> channel ops are responsible for keeping the members in line yes, but there are limits
[02:15:14] <Joanna> Channel members can leave and make their own channels if they aren’t happy but often they just quit irc instead
[02:15:15] <Hydragyrum> especially when some of the people being a problem are also chanops
[02:15:38] <Joanna> Hydragyrum: definitely time to leave if that’s the case :)
[02:16:03] <Hydragyrum> that's why I banned myself in #security
[02:16:54] <Joanna> I’ve seen channel ops seduced by trolls which take control of them before. Which is also disastrous for the channel.
[02:18:12] <Joanna> Anyone who has seen lord of the rings movies is familiar with grimmar worm tongue character. It’s like that
[02:19:08] <jan6> "seduced by trolls" is something I've a bit of a hard time picturing, lol
[02:19:36] <Joanna> It’s ugly I assure you ...
[02:19:53] <jan6> since I generally see trolls as not the sneaky type, but those who broadly and loudly speak up
[02:20:41] <Joanna> People who are incompetent can be left in charge of channels. An ivory tower scientist type is no match for a professional troll :)
[02:21:52] <jan6> I guess our definitions of "troll" are just very different, lol
[02:21:56] <Joanna> Trolls have many methods. They certainly test the boundaries by saying disrespectful rude things in channel for starters.
[02:22:17] <spiderman> I would never do that
[02:22:48] <Joanna> Sometimes trolls will private message the ops to try to gain influence or cause trouble.
[02:23:00] <ilikeyou> evenin' , beautiful minds
[02:23:13] <spiderman> sometimes I ask for voice so I can feel powerful

[09:18:49] <lind{at}yahoo> so I just talked to DoD Joint Command Operations, they told me there is a geo-specific issue in the "networking mainframe" caused by an xbox update interfering with the Google mainframe that is doing some really weird shit. They said Wisconsin -> Tennessee packets are being transformed in Chicago for unknown reasons... god I love not having a clearance!
