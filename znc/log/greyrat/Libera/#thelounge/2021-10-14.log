NPM states you can't upload again within 24 hours of the same name.  NPM doesn't allow you to rename your account, but I have done a new one ready.  Hopefully once 4.3.0 is released it
[19:58:30] <Activ8> will be updated.  I need to do some more testing on my themes for 4.3.0. 😄
[19:59:18] <Activ8> I don't know how many people are using it, I just know since I released it there was about 1200 pulls.

[20:42:42] <mooff> thelounge should maybe try a Debian style release system
[20:42:58] <mooff> right now there are mostly stable builds, that come say every 6 months
[20:43:20] <mooff> the pre builds are similar to Debian testing
[20:43:25] <mooff> and master is sid
[20:43:49] <mooff> most moderately technical users can run fine on sid, and appreciate the new features
[20:43:54] <xnaas> I'd run master and test it live all the time, but restarting thelounge sucks because I lose all my image embeds. :(
[20:44:43] <mooff> it sucks for me because it quits from +40 channels then rejoins on 2 servers

[23:17:39] <Activ8> wowzer I can move channels now on ios :D whoop whoop tis working
[23:18:43] <Activ8> wow if I have it opened on my other device and move a channel on my phone the delay is 1 second and it moves automatically on the other device, that's great!
[23:19:26] <Activ8> is that why there is no right click now on channel on a non smartphone device
[23:19:42] <Activ8> I assume everything is done by the 3 dots

[23:27:18] <Activ8> I said a few things at once
[23:27:51] <johncs> "in the master am I supposed to be able to right click channels or has that changed somewhere?"
[23:28:29] <Activ8> right, erm one sec let me spin up my 4.2.0 container
[23:29:24] <Activ8> I'm fairly sure you could right click the channels, I actually like it like this where the channels are locked unless you click the 3 dots
[23:29:57] <Activ8> right click does nothing on channels.  Browser = Microsoft Edge latest version

[23:38:56] <johncs> Works on Edge on Mac OS for me. Swipe right on iOS also works for me, but my iPhone is a bit older
[23:39:38] <johncs> Sounded like MaxLeiter had an iOS device though, might be newwer
[23:40:26] <johncs> Maybe he has a convenient way to test on edge on windows too 😅. I do have a dual boot but it takes forever to switch between them.
[23:40:51] <Activ8> that's a bit odd let me test something a sec

[23:43:04] <Activ8> nothing in the dev console at all when I right click
[23:43:46] <johncs> Are you running from source Activ8? If I tell you to cherry-pick a commit could you do that?
[23:43:47] <Activ8> I have an iphone 8, single finger swipe left works (opens channel list), single swipe right (does nothing)
[23:44:08] <johncs> Er wait, what do you expect single swipe right to do?
[23:44:28] <Activ8> in the help it tells me single right swipe opens the window
[23:44:30] <Activ8> lol
[23:45:14] <Activ8> under "gestures" it says = single-finger swipe right - show sidebar
[23:45:24] <johncs> If you swipe your finger from the left side of the screen to the right side of the screen, the channel list should open. If you then go from the right side of the screen to the left, the channel list should close.
[23:45:31] <johncs> Which one of those isn't working?
[23:45:56] <Activ8> oh
[23:46:02] <Activ8> swipe right closes that window
[23:46:07] <Activ8> not open the "user list"
[23:46:35] <johncs> That's correct, there's no way to swipe open the user list right now
[23:46:43] <johncs> So I think everything's working as intended then?
[23:46:47] <johncs> Besides the right clicking
[23:47:12] <Activ8> it is yeh but, that might need updating in the help to say "closes channel window" and the swipe left "opens channel window"
[23:47:30] <Activ8> because it says hide sidebar, show sidebar I assumed it was the user list
[23:47:43] <Activ8> that's fine that works as intended
[23:48:06] <Activ8> I'm doing some 4.3.0 testing on my new themes you see and I thought it was my theme at fault. 😄
[23:48:08] <johncs> That makes sense. The channel window is called the sidebar in the code, but not in any user-facing capacity I think. Can figure out a better name for that.
[23:48:11] <xnaas> https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/download/?platform=linux get that hawt Edge on Linux, johncs ;P
[23:48:19] <xnaas> or if you're on macos, pretty sure they have stable already
[23:48:35] <Activ8> mac os you could use docker containers but not sure if you know docker, it's heavy
[23:48:37] <johncs> I have it on Mac OS but couldn't repro the right click breakage :(

[23:49:05] <johncs> Yeah I could use VMs... my computers not great with 'em though
[23:49:19] <Activ8> ok ok, erm I like how I can't click the channel list on a desktop browser.  Going back one step am I supposed to be able to right click channels for a menu to popup
[23:49:28] <Activ8> or is it only down to the 3 dots now?

[23:49:47] <johncs> Activ8 yes you're supposed to be able to do that, I think a PR I opened might inadvertently fix it though if my guess as to what's happening is correct
[23:49:49] <xnaas> ah, I see, you wanted to test in Windows specifically — my bad!
[23:50:01] <johncs> If I told you to cherry-pick a commit, would you be able to do that Activ8?
[23:50:19] <Activ8> I could try it no problem
[23:50:28] <johncs> haha no worries xnaas 
[23:50:49] <Activ8> xnaas, it was two different things I think both changes where what johncs had done
[23:51:19] <johncs> Rad, cherry pick 68ff68169f8d0971dde6cc70ca8af4fbf3b1d872 or merge in the PR https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/pull/4332
[23:53:46] *** Quits: captain_morgan (~morgan@oit.cloud) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:54:04] <johncs> Ah it is actually called the sidebar in the rest of the help documentation so I think I'll leave it as is for now. Though if you want to open up an issue to pitch a different vocabulary you're welcome to. I'd make the change if you can get a consensus
[23:54:59] <Activ8> it's alright I don't mind what it's called but the terminolgy confused me slightly. I just thought it might have had the user list open but no that is perfectly fine

[23:56:47] <johncs> Activ8 what do you mean test?
[23:57:03] <johncs> I think it may allow you to right click on channel names
[23:57:23] <Activ8> is this a new one? have you just done it? 
[23:57:40] <johncs> No, it is a change not yet merged into master

[23:58:33] <johncs> It is addressing context menus in android, which were previously intentionally disabled, but that change un-disables them. I think the "disable context menus for Android" code might be confusing your browser with Android, essentially.
[23:58:41] <johncs> So this PR could resolve the problem.
[23:59:51] <Activ8> oh, erm right I build from master when I build my docker containers.  Do I build from that link what you just sent? I'm a little confused lol
