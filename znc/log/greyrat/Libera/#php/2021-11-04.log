[12:50:06] <Koopz> see that's the problem
[12:50:11] <Koopz> nobody reads the manual
[12:50:33] <Koopz> and if they do, they CTRL+F the bit they're looking for
[12:53:03] <Koopz> and let's be honest. Most of us will forget about this feature in a few again.
[12:53:13] <Koopz> weeks*
[13:00:13] <DevAntoine> Koopz: oh don't get me wrong, I do read the manual
[13:01:17] <DevAntoine> But yeah, not thoroughly
[13:05:05] <TML> it's been a few years since I used PHP regularly enough to justify it, but we used to do thing in our a weekly team meetings: adopt-a-page, where all the devs took a turn reading an entire page of the PHP manual and explaining it to the rest of the dev team in our weekly meeting, calling out anything they learned.
[13:06:40] <undefined_bob> TML: sounds fun but what if one couldn't explain because he didn't understand?

[16:36:01] <Koopz> so one thing i find kinda silly about this DomDocument thing is that, in case you generated the XML programmatically and want to validate it in a formatted state, you need two instances
[16:36:10] *** Quits: Xavier7 (~ircap@179.6.136.255) (Quit:  IRcap  8.72 )
[16:36:44] <Koopz> one instance where you format the XML and another instance where you load the first instance's saveXml()
[16:37:29] <Koopz> the formatting apparently only happens during saveXml() which i can totally understand from a performance perspective
[16:40:30] <Koopz> but, assuming that if you go the extra mile ans set formatOutput = true and preserveWhitespace = false, you'd assume that schemaValidate() would also take those flags into account since it's likely that the instance content will eventually be outputted somewhere
[16:43:36] <Koopz> though due to my lack of knowledge i'm not sure if i should blame schemaValidate() on that since it only really returns a boolean while the list of errors with the "wrong" line numbers actually come from libxml_get_errors()

[18:33:01] <pagios> i do it on system level or what
[18:33:06] <TinoDidriksen> If you're going to upgrade, you really should go to 8.x. The 7.x branch is also on last legs.
[18:33:11] <freeman_h> Naktibalda: you mean before the loop?
[18:33:14] <Naktibalda> pagios: it depends on if your code was written for PHP 5.4 or if it is an old PHP 4 codebase patched to run on 5.4
[18:33:22] <Naktibalda> freeman_h: yes
[18:33:36] <freeman_h> Naktibalda: how can you prepare something if you dont know what might be in it?

[18:34:40] <freeman_h> array_fill how does this help? looking at php.net cant see how it will help
[18:35:13] <Naktibalda> freeman_h: it is equivalent to for() loop in your placeholders function. haven't we seen it before?

[18:54:08] <impliednude> An issue, I Can't find any tutorials on how to using curl as middleware to pipe json to a selected rest api. When I replace the external json with internal json (via $details) it works just fine. here is 3v4l. What am I doing wrong?

[19:02:02] <biberu> so he'll upgrade again around 2029? ^^
[19:02:15] <TinoDidriksen> But if you're going to upgrade anyway, going to less-than-current is odd.
[19:02:33] <TinoDidriksen> Upgrade out-of-distro, that is.
[19:02:42] <biberu> running on something that's been eol for the better part of a decade is odd too
[19:03:15] <biberu> at least it's consistently odd

[20:43:26] <sybariten> so, i'm publishing a page at university.com . The page is at university.com/studentpages/some/student/onepage.php . The page has a "referer" (?) link to the unicorn validator.

[20:58:53] <__adrian> or did you mean for it to be something else? if it IS what you intended, then it's just the wrong URL, not a problem with your php script.
[21:00:50] *** Joins: AnrDaemon (~ZNC@darkdragon-nln.starlink.ru)
[21:04:41] <__adrian> if you're not following what's going on, my _guess_ is that "ucn_uri=referer" is meant to tell the validator to use the URI in the "Referer" header. hint: most browsers don't send Referer, _especially_ cross-domain. if that's what's supposed to happen, i would not expect it to be reliable, even if the validator didn't error like this.
