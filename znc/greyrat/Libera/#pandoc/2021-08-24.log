[00:54:45] <nova> Anyone know how to create something for pandoc-latex-environment that can accept arguments? I am trying to perhaps do something like this http://sprunge.us/QVOj1t?markdown
[00:55:04] <nova> there is like ... no documentation
[01:03:01] <nova> or .. what is the mechanism by which ::: foo is converted into ... something different? does that have to do with pandoc-latex-environment
