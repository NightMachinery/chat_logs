[00:34:03] <ggoes> can you first check if it works if you have librejs on?
[00:34:18] <ggoes> we rely on volunteers to let us know when to change something there
[00:35:11] <jacobk> Well, I'm not sure if this is a recent development or if I'm just misunderstanding something. I have LibreJS + a bunch of other extensions in Abrowser; I'll try in stock IceCat and see if it works there.
[00:36:19] <ggoes> i see that it currently says that the JS is free but not librejs compliant (which isn't a dealbreaker)
[00:36:26] <ggoes> but if it requires a nonfree captcha, that is a dealbreaker

[00:38:46] <jacobk> But, I can't find the source code for the JavaScript
[00:40:03] <jacobk> OH wait I remember this; I actually emailed hCaptcha to ask if it was free, like 6 months ago.
[00:40:53] <jacobk> "As of now the hCaptcha api js source code is not available in non-obfuscated format." - hCaptcha support
[00:41:36] <jacobk> hCaptcha was used in something else besides Runbox, but in both cases the file is called hcaptcha.js

[01:06:51] <jacobk> "colocated"?

[01:14:13] <leah> plus lots of other things

[01:15:33] <ggoes> that would be cool
[01:15:39] <leah> basically like heads. but i have a different vision for that: don't do the security stuff heads does by default, but document how to configure it for that
[01:15:50] <leah> rather, make it a general purpose, swiss-army-knife rescue system of sorts
[01:16:42] <leah> with it, you could also set up a tmpfs. and with apk-tools you could, for instance, download lynx. then use that to browse distro sites, download a distro (in tmpfs) and dd it to a usb drive
[01:17:02] <leah> so if you b0rked something, you always have something in flash to save you

[01:19:39] <leah> older lb versions were less power efficient on that board
[01:19:57] <leah> well it's a testing release, but mb21 is stable on that release
[01:20:04] <leah> no known major issues
[01:20:05] <ggoes> i'm currently on txtmode because i couldn't get corebootfb working properly
[01:20:16] <ggoes> the fb showed up in like the top left quadrant of the screen and nowhere else
[01:20:23] <ggoes> but i didn't play with it too much
[01:20:35] <leah> i actually have a mb21 now. last time i owned one was in 2015
[01:20:55] <ggoes> i do like it as a machine. the keyboard is nice. it's not a bad laptop once you cover the sticker :)
[01:20:56] <leah> i normally rely on others to test roms on that machine. but now i can test it myself. i'll look into that issue you described
[01:21:49] <leah> i actually think it's good. good for stealth
[01:22:04] <ggoes> this was on the release before 202111 (may something?) i didn't try corebootfb with the november release

[01:26:55] <ggoes> i'm pretty sure
[01:27:25] <leah> when you say it only showed in a corner, did it look cropped or did it just seem like a tiny window in the corner. everything on screen, but not stretched. like when you run a virtual machine at low res on a high resolution in host os
[01:27:32] <leah> (if that makes sense)
[01:28:00] <leah> i guess i'll just test it myself when i get round to it. i'm working on other machines for now. i bought the mb21 strictly for testing roms on, for releases
[01:28:04] <ggoes> definitely a tiny window in the corner
[01:28:16] <ggoes> everything was there, just limited to the top left corner, like a tiny screen
[01:28:42] <leah> ok, well that's not the end of the world. i'll see about fixing that though, when i look at that machine
[01:29:02] <ggoes> yeah, no, not a dealbreaker by any stretch. i just decided to flash txtmode instead
[01:29:06] <ggoes> after that
[01:29:12] <ggoes> no complains there
[01:29:23] <leah> specifically what was it that was like that though
[01:29:27] <leah> was it the actual payload
[01:29:30] <leah> or
[01:29:45] <leah> did you boot a grub bootloader, as supplied by your distro(not the libreboot grub payload)
[01:29:54] <leah> and that grub bootloader was the one to be a small window
[01:30:20] <leah> (i assume you used seabios and seabios loaded whatever grub you had on your hdd)
[01:30:41] <ggoes> from what i remember it was booting a grub payload off of a usb, and the live distro's grub and framebuffer never started using the full screen
[01:31:00] <leah> oh, yeah
[01:31:13] <leah> so, there are basically 2 instances:
[01:31:18] <leah> * coreboot grub (in libreboot)
[01:31:22] <leah> * bios/uefi grub
[01:31:33] <leah> sounds like you were doing the latter. bios grub booting off of seabios
[01:31:42] <leah> that's intended behaviour, and not a bug
[01:32:14] <leah> you might consider corebootfb grub_withseabios (not seabios_withgrub) rom. then you will use the grub that's in flash, not distro grub. the reason this is important:
[01:32:53] <leah> seabios has seavgabios, which is a free shim that handles some vga stuff (but doesn't let you change modes). bios grub in that setup will only show in that "small window" as you saw. it's actually expected behaviour
[01:33:08] <leah> that grub doesn't make use of the coreboot framebuffer, but rather, is being handled by seavgabios
[01:33:14] <ggoes> oh, okay. yeah, that makes sense
[01:33:22] <leah> libreboot's own grub, that's coreboot-grub
[01:33:37] <leah> that grub doesn't use x86 bios/uefi, it runs bare metal
[01:34:03] <leah> and it uses corebootfb, at native res
[01:34:44] <leah> anyway, nothing wrong with your current setup. if it works for you, no need to change it
[01:35:11] <ggoes> right. i'm not really inclined to tinker with stuff when everything's working, but i'll give it a shot when i get some time just to see
[01:35:16] <ggoes> thanks for the info

[20:21:30] <ewwegweg> ı can switch fully irc
[20:24:06] <Noisytoot> There are other things that can break anonymity except your IP/account, for example, you frequently use "ı" instead of "i".
[20:24:22] <Noisytoot> And you have to connect without Tor to make a new account anyway.
[20:24:46] <AndrewYu> A lot of channels don't require an account

[22:36:00] <jacobk> ggoes: My Disroot account has been approved, so I can try out the webmail now. There's some problems with the JavaScript I think.
[22:36:00] <jacobk> One of the scripts that needs to be whitelisted is "https://mail.disroot.org/", which doesn't really make sense, as that's the URL with the interface.
[22:36:00] <jacobk> Once that is whitelisted, a few more scripts load, but there's 2 problematic scripts I see: https://mail.disroot.org/rainloop/v/1.16.0/static/ckeditor/ckeditor.js and https://mail.disroot.org/rainloop/v/1.16.0/static/js/min/libs.min.js
[22:36:00] <jacobk> The first is GPL software with no obvious way to get the corresponding source code, and the second is a bunch of libraries from various different sources.
[22:36:00] <jacobk> My understanding is that https://mail.disroot.org/rainloop/v/1.16.0/static/js/libs.js corresponds to the second URL previously mentioned, but that script includes pre-minified software, such as jQuery (easy to find corresponding source) and jQuery Migrate (not so easy), as well as other things that I didn't bother checking.
[22:36:01] <jacobk> I'm not sure if it's fair to say the webmail client is *not* free software, but it definitely doesn't work with LibreJS by default and as far as I can tell it's not easy to get the source code. But IceDove seems to work fine with the service.

[22:41:12] <Noisytoot> jacobk, the community edition is AGPLv3, the standard edition is nonfree
[22:45:08] <jacobk> Noisytoot: If that is true then it should be possible to get the source code that corresponds to Disroot's version, but I don't see an obvious way to do that.
