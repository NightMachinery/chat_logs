[01:36:09] <aquanight> it's setting the perl handler in a global variable, and it's entirely possible the WiringPi API itself does not allow more than one pin-driven ISR

[01:37:09] <aquanight> nope there's the isr.c example that does exactly that
[01:37:22] <aquanight> so the bug is with the low-level WiringPi XS API
[01:37:41] <jpmh> the main::  did not help
[01:37:51] <aquanight> it's using a single global variable to store the perl callback
[01:39:09] <aquanight> unfortunately, I'm not sure how this can be worked around. The wiringPiISR callback is void(void). I don't even know how you're supposed to know which pin ISR fired unless you define a separate sub for each pin
[01:39:29] <aquanight> which is exactly what their example isr.c does
[01:39:50] <tm604> could check ->read_pin for each of the pins to be monitored, if you don't mind the race condition

[01:41:48] <aquanight> they literally just store the name as a char*
[01:42:07] <jpmh> aquanight: and lopid - TY so much -I'm happy that at least I  was not missing something.  I'll just switch to C for this issue
[01:42:29] <aquanight> which is itself probably just default typemap'd from the perl call via SvPV_nolen or something
[01:42:35] <jpmh> I also 100% agree and was suspicious of the module when I discovered I could not pass a reference to the sub
[01:43:00] <aquanight> which means congratulations the stored char* is the pointer internal to the SV
[01:43:34] <aquanight> so if the SV you passed to set_interrupt is altered or god forbid deallocated, good bye cruel world.
