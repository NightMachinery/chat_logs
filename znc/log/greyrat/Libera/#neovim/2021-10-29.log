[00:32:16] <rawhawk> idk if im wrong but im confused how to do this 
[00:32:22] <gpanders[m]> no vim.opt does not do that, vim.opt is just the Lua equivalent of `:set`, no autocommands involved

[00:33:55] <rawhawk> i want it across all filetype
[00:34:49] <gpanders[m]> well `:set formatoptions-=o` in your init.vim is a good place to start, but if any ftplugin re-adds that option then you'll have to overwrite it manually by making your own `after/ftplugin` file
[00:35:39] <rawhawk> oh okay thank you!!
[00:36:06] <gpanders[m]> this should work: create a file `after/plugin/formatoptions.vim` under `~/.config/nvim` with the contents `autocmd FileType * setlocal formatoptions-=o`
[00:36:39] <gpanders[m]> you need to put it under "after" so that it runs last and the autocommand will run after the other filetype autocommands
[00:37:39] <rawhawk> will it also work if i use init.lua ?
[00:38:03] <gpanders[m]> sure, but you can't define autocommands in Lua yet so you're still writing Vim script either way
[00:38:52] <rawhawk> yes correct

[08:32:02] <bobdobbs> Hi all. I'm a vim noob, spending a little experimenting. In emacs I have a system for inserting templates. I have templates organised in a series of mode-specific folders. Within emacs, if I'm in a mode I can inject a template into the current buffer by typing a shorthand - often a few characters - and hitting 'tab'.
[08:32:45] <bobdobbs> So for example, If I'm in web-mode and I enter 'html5' and hit tab, a html skeleton document gets printed to the buffer.
[08:33:04] <bobdobbs> How can I set up something like this within nvim?

[10:55:46] <dundargoc[m]> First link is reference, the second one is more of a tutorial/explanation on it
[10:56:08] <bobdobbs> I can live without a third-party library of snippets. I could make my own. But it'd be useful to install the snippet library, cos then I'd be able to test ultisnip and know where it looks for snippets.
[10:56:10] <maverun[m]> how reading doc so far? are you getting closer to end?
[10:56:17] <dundargoc[m]> In the second link it's specifically section 05.4, "Simple mappings"

[10:58:27] <dundargoc[m]> maverun[m]: It's going alright. I'm currently at `usr_10.txt` on chapter 5. `usr_10` has been really useful so far. I've already learned lots like substitution, visual block shenanigans and ranges
[10:59:14] <maverun[m]> oh mind tell me summary of subsitution? iirc it is on `s/S` but i failed to see how it is useful compare to `c`
[11:00:21] <bloony> dundargoc: I know how I map keys, but mapping C-m to something doesn't change it.. as C-m is the same as <CR>

[15:40:49] <lainon_[m]> tried that tho 
[15:40:55] <lainon_[m]> I'm trying to install NVChad, but it always fails at calling PackerSync

[15:42:49] <lainon_[m]> oh well 
[15:42:55] <lainon_[m]> i'll figure something out
[15:44:51] <dundargoc[m]> clason: I'm thinking of adding a real quickstart to `packer.nvim`.
[15:44:51] <dundargoc[m]> 1. Would he want one?
[15:44:51] <dundargoc[m]> 2. Would he be OK with doing it like you showed me? I think that's *much* nicer than the wonky `use` syntax.
[15:44:58] <theh> clason: I'll try that room. Basically, packer still tries to install the (local) plugin, which is not available on that machine.
[15:46:36] <theh> X/Y wise I want this condition because I'm working on a plugin on my workstation but don't have it on my notebook. Since the two machines share the nvim config, I need the notebook to not look for that plugin.
[15:46:39] <clason[m]> well, yes, that's expected. `cond` is for _loading_, not for installing
[15:46:47] <clason[m]> there's no conditional installation
[15:47:08] <clason[m]> you have to conditionally construct the plugins table instead if you want that

[16:20:10] <theh> ignfed: Consider just `../lua/plugins.lua`. If you want per-plugin files (probably more work to navigate than a single file), then you could place config in a subfolder, e.g. `../lua/plugins/fooplug.lua` and `require` them.
[16:20:49] <clason[m]> you can put `lua` files in the `nvim/plugin` directory; then they will be loaded exactly like `vim` files
[16:20:51] <theh> * `require` them from `plugins., * .lua`.

[16:33:03] <ignfed[m]> theh: That is your structure?
[16:33:12] <theh> ignfed: That's mine. the `plugins/` folder is only for older vim-plugins that don't allow compact lua-style config.
[16:34:02] <theh> In `plugins.lua` I load (via `packer.nvim`) my plugins and configure them there too. I found lua plugins are usually quite compact to configure.

[16:37:53] <clason[m]> it has nothing do with environment variables, really (except for where the "main" `config/nvim` directory is); it's just the standard vim startup sequence (`:h startup`)

[16:44:23] <ignfed[m]> clason[m]: i'll see it
[16:46:02] <theh> For me a major takeaway lesson was that configuring all plugins in `lua/plugins.lua` is feasible, it doesn't become too unwieldy, which I worried about. I think putting everything in `init.lua` it too extreme in the direction, as it does get quite big.

I really like parts of nvim, but I sunk too much time in configuring it, that could have been used more productively. Keep in mind that there are other editors available, and "community" configs like spacevim etc. (never tried any). For me once the dust has settled (no more frequent changes), things seemed well.
