[17:02:49] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> protonmails pretty crap because if you use gnupg externally they strip all the external signatures from mime and outright drop all the encrypted messages :)
[17:03:19] <arthem> I totally agree that no provider should be facillitating crime, however they should be upfront about what they do and dont have access to and what they are able to do if required to by law inforcement

[17:21:50] <Apachez> for example signal is heavy on using STUN/TURN servers from google
[17:22:01] <Apachez> so its easy for google to map who (ip based) is speaking to who
[17:22:03] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> that entire post was about hiding from the 'we kill people based on metadata crowd tho' :) so not really the same threat model
[17:22:30] <Apachez> trust noone is the security solution :)
[17:22:43] <thedragon> demanding a phone number also cuts down on people abusing your service and mass registering accounts, etc
[17:22:59] <Apachez> yup

[17:26:16] <ionface> anonymizing services just make it easy for anyone to use, bad actors have been spoofing or bouncing since the dawn of time
[17:26:55] <ionface> weighting tor for spammy is probably still a good idea though
[17:27:15] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> the best part is if its really anonymous anyone that wants a warrent can make a few fake posts and get them raided :)
[17:28:27] <Apachez> best way to test how anonymous a service really is would be to put some threats against the us president and attempt to make use of those threats and then watch if secret service manage to locate you or not
[17:28:28] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> you used to be able to just go to random peoples dnms make fake posts for 6" lead line boxes and dirty bombs then report them and gett their threat level instantly through the roof level
[17:28:39] <Apachez> but that test methology have its drawbacks ;)

[17:34:37] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> selling spamware not directly opposing the we like to make money with a service that works ? couldnt see any of them actually doing it

[17:38:03] <ionface> sorry, thought we were talking about spammers, if it's censorship that's another conversation I guess
[17:39:27] <ionface> post throttling is pretty good for russian botnets, but idk about APTs
[17:39:30] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> thats what spam is tho when your pretending to be 10k people to manipulate peer reenforcement and perception of acceptance and dont have persmission from built in advertising
[17:40:08] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> most people with any capability to beat that stuff now are all for profit entitites

[17:47:30] <m242> I guess I did hear about it then, lol
[17:47:37] <chester> It's really nice to see them pull of such operations.
[17:48:06] <chester> The things those type of criminals do are so disgusting.
[17:48:19] <chester> It's a new way of fighting crime.
[17:48:25] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> is it tho literally the death of privacy on the internet, and by disgusting not being doxxed isnt really all that bad
[17:48:39] <m242> I haven't digged that much, what type of criminals were these, chester?
[17:50:09] <chester> I think privacy is undeserved when you're a criminal. I know how it sounds, but I think it's way more important to prevent crimes. But I'm aware of the issue that "crime" is having the wrong hair style in some countries.
[17:50:35] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> how do you tell the difference without violating everyone ?
[17:50:44] <chester> m242: drugs, trafficking and violence.
[17:50:59] <chester> e4vo3xmpqqa3: you don't.
[17:52:09] <chester> e4vo3xmpqqa3: wearing the wrong hairstyle is a problem, I think the real problem isn't privacy on the internet.
[17:53:55] <chester> Encrypted chats can't be the savior of democracy. I'm all for private conversations, I encrypt mine. But I got no sympathies whatsoever for traffickers using it. I suppose it's a double-edged sword.
[17:54:37] <ionface> so, they gave out 12,000 encrypted txt/VOIP phones which they had full control over, what kind of dimwit mafioso fell for that?
[17:54:56] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> and investigating human trafficking doesnt have a higher scope than backdooring every public comms service just incase and hoping the criminals arent wearing the uniforms and abusing power to begin with : / slightly naive imo
[17:56:07] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> still just building a gun and hoping the right people use it which tends to be relative to the situation

[17:58:10] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> that not entrapment then ? hey anon want to buy a phone you can use to do crime on actively incentivising and encouraging it
[17:58:31] <ionface> more like, want to buy a bugged phone mr. godfather?
[17:58:32] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> that not mean their liable for any thing that happen using those phones as well

[17:58:42] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> given they enabled it to begin with
[17:58:56] <ionface> I mean, there's privacy and there's warranted wiretapping
[17:59:24] <m242> I believe it's not entrapment because providing (pseudo) privacy is legal, and what clients use this privacy for is none of your concern
[17:59:34] <m242> depends on the contract et al
[18:00:02] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> they advertised it for that purpose tho what did they think they would be used for ? if they were stinging it and how much actually happened before they were caught
[18:01:04] <e4vo3xmpqqa3> i watched a senate talk on a gun sting were the fbi lost 100s of assault rifles then 2 years later they were used to kill a load of cops in some state level dumb before

[21:54:32] <arkanoid> hello! Would you help me identify how a calender account has been added to my iPhone? I've started receiving events on calendar app, so I tracked down an extra caleder account on my app pointing to a webcal server. I've double checked that it doesn't come from remotely synced caledars as I have no sync enabled on it (I don't use calendar on my phone) and nor icloud cal nor google cal has same
[21:54:34] <arkanoid> events listed, so it seems local
[21:54:52] *** Joins: Leonarbro (~Leonet@user/leonarbro)
[21:54:57] <arkanoid> what are the possible events that can add a calendar account locally on an iOS?
