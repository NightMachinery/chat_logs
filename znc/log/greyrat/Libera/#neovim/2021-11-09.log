[00:28:58] <mrassiliMarouane> Yeah that’s tedious, for small changes, I would like to setup a simple command to source the config for me but it’s hard with mixed config files
[00:29:09] <clason[m]> yes
[00:29:24] <clason[m]> because unwinding a complex editor state is tedious
[00:29:39] <clason[m]> seriously, restarting neovim is much simpler and safer
[00:30:39] <Julian> mrassiliMarouane: the vim part is somewhat easy if you were careful (e.g. used `:function!` and `au!` etc.)
[00:30:51] <Julian> the lua part is a bit more annoying (and I haven't done it) -- it involves writing your own reload thing
[00:30:56] <Julian> I think TJ has an example of one
[00:31:04] <Julian> But of course the advice of "give up" is indeed the simplest :)

[00:34:48] <saltrocklamp[m]> reloading `.vim` and `.lua` scripts is a matter of running the right files with `:runtime!`, but figuring out which files to run in what order is not trivial.
[00:34:48] <saltrocklamp[m]> reloading a lua module in theory is as simple as `package.loaded = nil` and then `require`-ing the file again. if your module just defines a bunch of functions and doesn't actually "do any work", then you should be pretty safe with that process.
[00:34:48] <saltrocklamp[m]> note that `:source` works in both vimscript and lua files, and also works on a _range_ of lines in neovim, so you can `:'<,'>source` small sections of your config in a lot of cases
[00:35:41] <saltrocklamp[m]> but for the most part i have one instance of neovim open to edit the config, and i repeatedly open and close another instance for testing. setting up a kind of reloading framework would be cool, but definitely depends on writing "well-behaved" scripts.

[21:18:50] <smolck> <mjlbach[m]> "I am no longer going to answer..." <- when's the post-mortem
[21:22:22] <mjlbach[m]> Well, I did a pre-mortem after people started complaining about plugin documentation
[21:22:25] <jaawerth> nub: while I don't think it's built in, I'm pretty sure there's a plugin for irrsi that will give you a smart filter ala weechat's option that limits join/part to people who sent a message in the past N minutes

[21:49:35] <mjlbach[m]> I think it's ok to rebrand the readme references from nvim-lspconfig to lspconfig
[21:49:46] <mjlbach[m]> tbh I would favor changing the repo name as well
[21:50:48] <mjlbach[m]> smolck: how hard would it be to add an additional readme to the bot?
[21:51:22] <mjlbach[m]> lspconfig is kinda special in that it's a core official plugin and now that I wrote a comprehensive help doc would be nice to redirect people to it going forward

[22:00:49] <clason[m]> 👍️ on the rebranding (and repository renaming)
[22:01:34] <mjlbach[m]> it just seems redundant haha
[22:01:36] <mjlbach[m]> neovim/nvim that is
[22:01:58] <mjlbach[m]> I would actually prefer neovim/lsp-configurations if I was in a vacuum :) 
[22:02:05] <clason[m]> agree
[22:02:22] <clason[m]> (although `lspconfig` for short is fine with me)
[22:02:27] <mjlbach[m]> we can do the full rebranding when I remove all of the root utilties/lsp-manager from lspconfig
[22:02:36] <mjlbach[m]> (when it's implemented in core)
[22:03:01] <clason[m]> sounds good
[22:11:26] <smolck> <mjlbach[m]> "smolck: how hard would it be..." <- pretty easy, if I understand what you're asking
