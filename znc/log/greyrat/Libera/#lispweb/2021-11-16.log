[09:26:48] <ln43> Really after i think js is not so bad as a language...
[09:27:24] <ln43> after many years from its invention is still working well..
[09:27:35] <ln43> but the same is for php: is not bad di per se
[09:27:54] <ln43> ok, it's simple and then there was a lot of mispractice
[09:28:41] <ln43> but ok, with php after 10 minutes one is able to do a lot more than not after 10 minutes of java
[09:30:16] <ln43> ok... to be honest the netscape was a good browser before the '20s...and there was a war wit explorer that used only something derived from visualbasic
[09:31:39] <ln43> and that was a failure for that browser since the beginning

[09:32:09] <ln43> but again ecma 262 or iso/iec 16262 are still valid nowdays
[09:32:15] <ln43> or not?
[09:32:54] <ln43> and then there was also opera as a good browser
