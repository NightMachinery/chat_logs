[00:31:36] <Skyz> Okay question:
[00:31:46] <Skyz> x**2-x = e**2 + 2
[00:32:06] <Skyz> can I solve like this or do I need to solve with a 0 on the right side, if so why?
[00:36:19] <somiaj> that is a quadratic equation, so can be solved with the standard methods for a quadratice equation.
[00:39:01] <Skyz> Quadratic equation is ax**2 bx + c
[00:39:17] <Skyz> ax**2 + bc + c = 0
[00:39:22] <qergle> that's what you have

[00:39:45] <Hash> Hi
[00:39:54] <Hash> Can someone help me to understand what is a tuple in plain English
[00:40:14] <Hash> In mathematics, a tuple is a finite ordered list (sequence) of elements
[00:40:19] <qergle> an ordered list
[00:40:24] <Hash> what is an ordered list?
[00:40:28] <Hash> like top to bottom
[00:40:31] <qergle> like (2,3,5)
[00:40:35] <Hash> i see
[00:40:41] <Hash> you missed 4
[00:40:46] <Hash> so that's not an order?
[00:40:54] <Hash> or you mean lwo to high or high to low
[00:40:59] <qergle> are you ordering me to add it?

[00:41:21] <Hash> I'm just wondering if when you skipped '4' if that is out of order or
[00:41:28] <Hash> ordered list means exactly what?
[00:41:34] <qergle> ordered means that the order matters, unlike in sets {2,3,5} = {5,3,2}, but (2,3,5) ≠ (5,3,2)
[00:41:40] <Hash> Oh order of appearance.
[00:41:58] <Hash> I thought you mean like say if you have an even order, you can't have an odd number in it, contradiction breaks oder
[00:42:00] <Hash> order*
[00:42:18] <somiaj> Hash: (8,3,5) -- ordered list means (8,3,5) and (3,5,8) and (5,8,3) are all different 3-tuples
[00:42:38] *** Joins: usr25 (~usr25@user/usr25)
[00:43:07] <Hash> In mathematics, a sequence is an enumerated collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed and order matters.
[00:43:27] <somiaj> correct, you can repeate too
[00:43:29] <qergle> one place you might have seen tuples before is in coordinates on the plane (ie R²). so we say the point (2,3) or the point (3,2), they're different.
[00:43:30] <Hash> Unlike a set, the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in a sequence, and unlike a set, the order does matter.

[03:42:38] <droid3> I am wondering the element base isnt a primitive root mod n. Then wont you have more then one solution to the DLP.
[03:42:42] <droid3> Possible
[03:43:16] <droid3> aka the discrete log becomes multivalued function if the base isnt a primative root mod n.

[04:01:36] <droid3> what your logic on that assertion ?
[04:01:39] <Juliu> droid3, if I recall correctly, the wikipedia article on primitive roots had something in it that pointed to something else with regards to how to deal with bases that are not prime. It might have been something related to the chinese remainder algorithm. I can't remember clearly

[04:19:19] <droid3> such as Diffie–Hellman key exchange are we always mod a prime?
[04:19:59] <Juliu> droid3, I dont think so
[04:19:59] <droid3> because if its not then we could have multivalues or no-primitive roots at all for the DLP.

[04:21:15] *** Quits: jeslie0 (~user@108.162.150.9) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[04:21:19] <Juliu> They dont just use random numbers for the primitive root and the modul. They use specifically chosen numbers to prevent certain attacks, because if you dont select those numbers carefully, it might be easy to crack the encryption
[04:22:15] <Juliu> Which is why 90% of the internet uses the same modul, which is why it is probably cracked already by the CIA
[04:22:21] <Juliu> (not joking)
[04:22:32] <droid3> ok but are they using a fix primitive root g or randomly generating that primitive root?
[04:23:19] <Juliu> Like I said earlier, they are using the number 2 as the "primitive root". Well, actually it's not really a primitive root since only half of the elements in the ring are created
[04:23:23] *** Joins: Macuser (~Macuser@216.30.159.201)
[04:23:28] <droid3> you could do it either way. but the later take effort in generating a primitive root

[04:24:43] <Juliu> At least no way is known to the public
[04:24:44] <droid3> Ok so g=2 say but then they have to pick a huge random prime for the modulus to be safe

[04:26:03] <Juliu> Of course there might be other encryption standards that do things completely different. Like elliptic curve cryptography for example
[04:26:40] <Juliu> droid3, since there is no efficient way known to factorize this huge number for the modulus, no, you can't
[04:26:57] <Juliu> If you could, yes, then the whole encryption would break down
[04:27:20] <droid3> ok but if g is fix = 2 say and modulus is not a prime how can you be sure that the log g in theory would give a single value function the answer a or b
[04:27:45] <droid3> you could possible have multivalue solutions to the log if its not a primitive root for the base ... i hope you get what i am saying.
[04:28:38] <Juliu> droid3, in case you have 2 numbers what both satisfy the discrete log, just pick the smaller one. Easy :)
[04:28:57] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[04:28:59] <droid3> I am talking about the key exchange not ECC or RSA pieces just traditional Diffie–Hellman
[04:29:21] <Juliu> And since I told you that they are sure that they can create half of the elements in the ring, there is probably no way that you can get more then 2 solutions for the discrete log
[04:29:23] <[itchyjunk]> apparently monte carlo integration is using probability distribution to get analytic answer for integration somehow?
[04:29:27] <[itchyjunk]> black magic
[04:30:02] <Juliu> [itchyjunk], how is that black magic?
[04:30:03] <droid3> ya but the next thing i am getting at is if there are multivalues for the log actually weaken the DLP problem for reverse engineering ?
[04:30:12] <bosspotato> uh it doesn't get an analytic answer normally
[04:30:19] <droid3> "droid3, in case you have 2 numbers what both satisfy the discrete log, just pick the smaller one. Easy :)"
[04:30:22] <bosspotato> it's a numerical technique
[04:30:24] <[itchyjunk]> how is precise area being figured out by randomness?
[04:30:29] <[itchyjunk]> oh
[04:30:42] <Juliu> droid3, since they are sure that half of the elements are created, no, it does not weaken the encryption. Or at least not much. Only by 1 bit probably
[04:30:43] <[itchyjunk]> it doesn't converge to the same answer as analytic?
[04:31:13] <bosspotato> analytic means closed form usually
[04:31:22] <bosspotato> it converges to the same answer in probability
[04:31:50] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[04:31:58] <[itchyjunk]> still weird!
[04:32:07] <bosspotato> not terribly so
[04:32:19] <Juliu> [itchyjunk], draw a circle, draw a minimal enclosing square around the circle, throw darts at the square randomly distributed, and then count how many darts lie inside the circle and how many are outside. This gives you Pi as well
[04:32:21] <bosspotato> it's basically just a glorification of the law of large numbers
[04:32:38] <[itchyjunk]> wtf
[04:32:53] <[itchyjunk]> how on earth is pi being figured out by tossing darts!
[04:33:00] <[itchyjunk]> why does it work?
[04:33:14] <[itchyjunk]> oh law of large number
[04:33:19] <[itchyjunk]> something i should know but dont
[04:33:21] <droid3> O so it relies on them knowing that there still be alot of group elements that you have to try regardless of if there are multivalued solutions to DLP. Because of the 1/2  only 1 bit thing you mentioned Juliu... ok i see. but if you did choose the DLP so that the base gave ridiculous amounts of multivalue options then it would be tractable to solve possible.
[04:34:40] <Juliu> [itchyjunk], the number of darts inside the circle and outside are an approximation for the areas if you throw the darts uniformly (randomly) distributed, and if the number of thrown darts approaches infinity, this converges towards the true area of the circle
[04:35:33] <[itchyjunk]> you need to know the area of circle?
[04:36:13] <[itchyjunk]> you're looking at how likely it is to land outside the circle and the more of the that are outside the circle, the larger the area of the outside or somesuch?
[04:36:16] <[itchyjunk]> vaguely makes snese
[04:36:22] <Juliu> [itchyjunk], if you know the area of the circle and the area of the square, you can calculate Pi with that. In my example all you need to know is the number of darts inside the circle and the total number of thrown darts
[04:36:40] <[itchyjunk]> you don't need to know the area of circle or square?
[04:36:49] <[itchyjunk]> then i don't understand how this magic works

[04:38:46] <bosspotato> in this case, you take A to be [-1,1]x[-1,1], say, and you take f(x) to be 1 if x lies in the unit circle and 0 otherwise
[04:39:08] <Juliu> [itchyjunk], let's say you throw 400 darts at the square, uniformly distrubuted, then the expected value of darts inside the circle is 314. And Pi is 3.14...

[04:46:12] <droid3> well what i was getting at is there away to polynomial reduce the problem of integer factorization to DLP and visa-versa. Or do we still not know there of the same hardness class level.
[04:46:32] <Juliu> droid3, the 2 primes being too close together is just 1 example. There are several different attacks known depending on the choice of the modulus. So they try to make it as hard as possible for all of these attack methods when they choose the modulus

[05:01:00] <droid3> and if its not a primitive base then it may not have a solution at all.
[05:01:10] <Juliu> droid3, what is the squareroot of 9 ?
[05:01:21] <droid3> 3
[05:01:32] <Juliu> droid3, why did you choose 3 ?
[05:01:32] <droid3> thanks for the talk just recapping.
[05:01:47] <droid3> because i like it better then -3
[05:01:55] <droid3> i see your point thanks

[05:03:39] <droid3> but if you dont have a primitive root base you cannt guarantee that you even have even a solution to the discrete log at all :)
[05:03:49] <droid3> for ever value that is.
[05:04:21] <Juliu> droid3, since half of the elements are created, you can guarantee it for those elements
[05:04:50] <droid3> sure but not all unless its a primitive root base

[05:06:08] <droid3> yes i know for the crypto systems sure but for a math guy wanting a solution to any value for a discrete log you kind of want the primitive root base. So its well defined everywhere
[05:06:14] <Juliu> I find it way more interesting how they can be sure that 2 creates all these elements

[05:07:11] <droid3> Even though you dont need to for cryptosystem as we discussed

[05:10:22] <Juliu> droid3, I think that mathematics will NOT help you with this problem to be honest. Look at what an integer number is when you implement it: A sequence of bits. And what happens to those bits when you rise them to some power? They get multiplied and added. And to reverse this process, you come to points where you can't know in advance if the bit has to be 0 or 1
[05:10:48] <Juliu> So it's like a giant jigsaw puzzle. Or maybe a giant knot is an even better analogy

[05:13:31] <Juliu> And I would even argue that math is taking the top-down approach, since it works on the whole numbers, and not on individual bits. And I think to solve this problem you need a bottom-up approach instead

The relational model represented a major breakthrough for both users and designers. To use an analogy, the relational model produced an "automatic transmission"

[09:11:45] <droid3> kind of a random stupid question that i have been thinking on. Is this.
[09:12:16] <droid3> We know by faltings that genus >= 2 have only finite rational points.
[09:13:16] <droid3> So is there any useful algebraic curves that are not elliptic or hyperelliptic curves that have cool geometric group arithmetic that we can define/relate?
[09:14:05] *** Joins: hyiltiz (~quassel@31.220.5.250)
[09:14:07] <qergle> i've seen some whacky group laws on weird curves used for crypto proof-of-concepts
[09:14:16] <droid3> It seems we use elliptic curves alot and now with manjul bhargava and other result we can do neat things with hyperelliptic curves to some extent.
[09:14:19] <qergle> but i can't recall details now
[09:14:56] <droid3> But i was just kind of wondering if we have any geometric formula relation like we do for elliptic curve
[09:15:27] <droid3> Sure we have pic groups and jacobians ...etc
[09:15:28] <qergle> you mean like take the secant, reflect over axis, etc?
[09:16:03] <droid3> And sure algebraic groups can be associated to  algebraic curves.
[09:16:43] <droid3> But other then elliptic and hyperelliptic i cannt see how there any practical formulas and geometric connections one can visualize.
[09:17:24] <droid3> Other then mapping them to polynomial arithmetic or ideals of varieties or zarisk topology ...etc

[09:17:50] <droid3> I just dont see a clear generalization of elliptic curve arithmetic to general algebraic curves
[09:18:39] <droid3> Maybe it does exist but its doubtful to be an a nice equation formula or nice visual geometric arithmetic like the case of elliptic curves have.
[09:19:21] <droid3> Just figured i throw it out there is if anybody else thought on making a arithmetic for higher algebraic curves.
[09:19:41] <droid3> That is useable in computer computations
[09:20:12] <droid3> sure we have it in theory but can it ever be useful in computing
[09:21:04] <droid3> Like is there any useful group structure we can use to get better performance then elliptic curve factorization or hyperelliptic curve factorization.
[09:21:42] <droid3> It seems when implementing even small portions of hyperelliptic curve factorization (AT LEAST THE WAY I WAS TRYING IT)
[09:22:04] <droid3> It is no better then most of the time worse then just using elliptic curve factorization algorithms
[09:23:02] <droid3> But this could be just because hyperelliptic curve i am choosing are just to limited.
[09:24:30] <droid3> or maybe there a bigger issue that the groups are not giving use much more richer x^2=y^2 mod n identities
[09:24:59] <droid3> compared to the increase in computation need to perform the kP
[09:25:17] <droid3> meant k!P
[09:26:12] <droid3> At any extent maybe hyperelliptic curves are to restrictive maybe more general algebraic curves i need or can give better x^2=y^2 mod n relations
[09:26:41] <droid3> enough so computation getting harder wont make out weigh the benifit
[09:27:00] <droid3> But i just not sure
[09:27:41] <droid3> Though it does seem by falting that genus 0 and 1 curves would have the most possible rational points to work with in finding relations.

[09:28:48] <droid3> But maybe the higher genus / degree curves out weigh that interms of having nice group structure to give these new x^2=y^2 mod n identities we need to progress to factor new primes.
[09:29:45] <droid3> Not sure and i have to say general number sieve using any kind of polynomials is more general approach anyway.
[09:30:14] <droid3> So maybe gnfs is still going to be the best way to continue progressing with integer factorization
[09:31:22] <droid3> but eliptic curve factorization is still up there so maybe algebraic curve factorization in some genus will give use even better results then what we have for gnfs but just not sure.

[09:36:25] <qergle> ok, i got punked. it happens.
[09:41:11] <isekaijin> droid3: I am not an expert on algebraic groups by any means, but I am pretty sure every group variety is an extension of a linear algebraic group by an Abelian variety, so if you want a group structure on an algebraic curve, it has to be the additive group structure on A^1, the multiplicative group G_m or an elliptic curve. But maybe you are okay with higher-dimensional groups?
[09:46:26] <isekaijin> I am trying to read Fulton's “Intersection theory” on my own, but it is too damned hard. It does not help when the main text refers you to the appendices, which in turn refer you to EGA. I have read parts of Hartshorne. Chapter 1, most of chapter 2 and some bits of chapter 3, but that is it. Should I actually read EGA or is there a shorter way to get a workable understanding of this material?

[13:24:05] <newpy> then why is the cumulative distribution function a line with slope 1/2 starting at (0,0)?
[13:24:44] <newpy> I mean I get why the probability X < 0 is 0, and that the probability X < 2 is 1
[13:25:33] <riv> newpy, probably due to the normalization factor
[13:25:38] <newpy> but I'm not sure why it isn't just a step function (eg. uniform distribution over [0,2] with height of 1/2?)
[13:26:16] <riv> well as you said this is cumulative
[13:26:35] <newpy> true
[13:26:55] <riv> the step function is the just the regular probability density function for that, isnt it?
[13:27:04] <newpy> yea you're right
[13:27:25] <newpy> so p(x<1) = 1/2, that makes sense

[17:36:36] <qergle> yes, some problems can more easily be counted other ways
[17:36:57] <qergle> but i can come up with a few examples where g.f. would be the easiest approach
[17:37:33] <qergle> it's another tool in the box. sometimes you need a screwdriver and sometimes you need a hammer.

[17:41:13] <int-e> bildramer: Well, I wouldn't go that far. It's merely convoluted.
[17:41:22] <qergle> For example, here's one where a g.f. approach is natural. How many subsets of {1,2,3,...,2p} of size p are there such that the sum of its elements is a multiple of p? (p an odd prime)

[17:49:14] <tmyklebu_> kobalt: (1) in some cases, generating series elucidate fast algorithms for computing the thing in question by giving you a computational algebra problem instead of a combinatorics problem.  (2) for some generating series, complex analysis lets you study e.g. asymptotics of coefficients via roots and poles of the generating series.  (3) sometimes generating series give you easy proofs of otherwise tricky
[17:49:20] <tmyklebu_> results.
[17:51:30] <kobalt> do we find coeff of x^p in (1+x+x^2+...+x^(2p))^(2p) qergle
[17:53:49] <int-e> My favorite surprising g.f. problem is this: Design two non-standard six-sided dice with positive integers as labels such that their sum's distribution is the same as that of casting two standard dice.
[17:53:58] <kobalt> tmyklebu_: yes, I understand it could be used for problems that have some contraints in it. the issue is to evaluating the coeffs is difficult.
[17:54:06] <qergle> Oh here's another where gf's can be handy. Take two dice and rub out the pips and write new integers on the 12 faces. Is there a way to do this so that if you roll both dice the sum is a prime in {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}, all occurring with equal probability?
[17:55:14] *** Joins: node1 (~node1@user/node1)
[17:56:17] <greenbagels> int-e: when you say nonstandard, do you mean; you just relabel the faces any way you want (allowing duplicates, but each face still has an equal prob.)?
[17:56:36] <int-e> greenbagels: yes. similar to qergle's problem, really
[17:57:05] <greenbagels> i'm going to stop reading the chat and use this problem as a motivation to properly learn about GFs this weekend :D
[17:57:22] <greenbagels> i never found the motivation to learn about them, probably in the same vein as kobalt's thinking
[17:57:23] <node1> How to measure my computer computing strength?
[17:57:53] <greenbagels> node1: there is no single test that will give you an objective measurement of your computing power in any situation
[17:58:00] <tmyklebu_> kobalt: yes, but if you broaden your goal past the computational problem of "how many foos are there of weight X," that becomes a feature.  you can reason about species you can't necessarily computationally enumerate in a speedy way.
[17:58:15] <int-e> qergle: Oh that problem looked kind of interesting, but it's actually boring :P
[17:58:30] <greenbagels> quoted performance about IOPS or FLOPS is always with respect to some toy problem or algorithm
[17:58:35] <greenbagels> but, this is probably offtopic for this channel
[17:58:35] <node1> greenbagels, But there must be some theoritical parameter to measure the calculation speed?
[17:59:00] <greenbagels> node1: people usually take the same algorithm on multiple platforms, and compare the number of operations performed per second
[17:59:14] <qergle> greenbagels: linux uses the concept of bogomips, iirc
[17:59:18] <node1> greenbagels, How can you please show some examples?
[17:59:57] <tmyklebu_> kobalt: and sometimes the algebraic tools you can bring to bear on a coefficient-extraction problem are just the right ones, even if their meaning is not immediately apparent in the combinatorial interpretation.  (i last did combinatorics coursework close to 10 years ago so i don't have examples handy.)
[18:00:01] <qergle> they probably invested a good amount of time to come up with (caveat: that doesn't mean it's any good)

[20:24:43] <qergle> To restate, take two dice and number their faces in the same way (with positive integers). Is there a way to number them such that when you roll them the possible sums are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and are equally likely.
[20:27:32] <somiaj> well 2 = 1+1 is the only way to get that as a sum, so just try to see if you can make only one combo give you the other sums
[20:28:15] <somiaj> 3 = 2+1, 5 = 4+1, 7 = 6+1, 11 = 10+1, and 13 = 12+1, so number the dice (1,2,4,6,10,12)
[20:28:21] *** Joins: magla (~gelignite@55d40b1a.access.ecotel.net)
[20:28:21] <int-e> yeah, you need 1+1, 1+2 and that forces you to also have 4. No fancy g.f. business required.
[20:28:40] <int-e> "in the same way" is a huge restriction
[20:29:00] <somiaj> and since all of the other sums must be even, there is exactly one combo that gives you each of 2,3,5,7,11,13
[20:29:19] *** Joins: cheater (~Username@user/cheater)
[20:29:20] <somiaj> hence they will all have the same probablity
[20:30:14] <qergle> somiaj: won't (1,2,4,6,10,12) give you 6, for example?
[20:30:33] <somiaj> though here I may have have changed the problem, to me I only made the sums you gave equally likely, I didn't rule out that other sums could happen
[20:30:50] <int-e> qergle: somiaj's solution has two different dice
[20:31:01] <int-e> qergle: as allowed per your original formulation of the problem
[20:31:01] <qergle> it does?
[20:31:12] <somiaj> two diffrent dice, with the same numbers
[20:31:15] <int-e> yes, one of them has all faces labelled with 1
[20:31:25] <qergle> he said "number the dice (1,2,4,6,10,12)" that suggests the dice are the same
[20:31:30] <int-e> hmm
[20:32:20] <int-e> okay, I may be confusing what somiaj suggested and what is the (only) working solution :P
[20:32:22] <qergle> somiaj: but even if you ignore the non-prime sums, 2 only happens one way, get in your dice you can get 7 in two ways
[20:32:31] <int-e> since there's a huge overlap between the two
[20:32:47] <somiaj> qergle: oh yea, I was counting (1,1) and (1,1) twice...you are right.

[21:07:53] <int-e> but a density wouldn't be bounded from above, necessarily
[21:08:18] <LTCD> Ω = {a, b, ..., z} so this Pr: Ω -> [0;1] is just saying when I take Pr(a) from set then it is 1/26 (of course if it is a uniformly random distribution).
[21:08:23] <int-e> unfortunate word order...
[21:09:00] <Koen_> oh, it's a discrete space
[21:09:03] <int-e> so your Omega is discrete.

[21:24:12] <qergle> note that {3,5} ∉ Ω

[23:17:48] <dextaa2> does the same argument work for K = {A : there exists a B substructure of A such that B ~= (R,<)} and downward Loewenheim-Skolem?
[23:18:12] *** Joins: oxum (~oxum@122.172.205.112)
[23:19:25] <dextaa2> i guess downward is a bit different as it is defined on the sentence set, at least for me
[23:19:47] <int-e> dextaa2: that's technical... do you have finite axiomatizability, or an arbitrary set of axioms (which may be uncountable...)
[23:20:24] <int-e> oh wait, you don't get to add extra symbols
[23:20:38] <int-e> so you only get countably many formulas (up to renaming variables)
[23:20:44] <int-e> so yes, downward L-S works
[23:20:57] <Inline> hmmm given a trajectory vector of something on a 2d plane
[23:21:08] <Inline> What are the symmetries involved ?
[23:21:12] <Guest54> int-e i think it is confusing https://i.imgur.com/SjZDKvw.png that here they just decide to sum the equations.
[23:21:18] <Inline> For the ambient space without any fields it's totally symmetric.
[23:21:23] <Guest54> like, why sum?

[23:21:44] <Inline> With the 1d line of R, we have quasi-symmetry with respect to reflection. When we reflect R_{-} and R_{+} change position, since the operation does not result in an identical coordinate orientation it is not symmetric.
[23:21:44] <Inline> The same holds for the ambient 2d Plane in which cartesian R^{2}is embedded.
[23:21:44] <Inline> However since we don't intend to apply the operation on the 1d line or the 2d plane itself it doesn't matter.
[23:22:26] <Inline> Our object of interest (the incoming and outgoing vector) is quasi symmetric, because vector directions change, without directions it is symmetric though.
[23:22:26] <Inline> For an ambient object (without any direction sense attached to it) reflection changes
[23:22:26] <Inline> it's orientation (determinant -1) but this results in identity in that case.
[23:22:51] <Inline> oh man, this stuff is getting so confusing really
[23:24:13] <int-e> Guest54: not sure why that is confusing... you sum because you can and because it corresponds to what happens inside the definition of the ideal <f_1,...,f_n>
[23:24:26] <dextaa2> int-e ah ok i finally get why size of the signature matters thanks

[23:45:35] <qergle> french probably
[23:46:59] <riv> they are considered "ideal numbers" because they have unique factorization when the horrible algebraic numbers do not

[23:47:17] <riv> i think it is due to dedekind

[23:48:06] <qergle> Guest54: there we go, once again, we can thank kummer
[23:48:13] <Z-module> [-_-]: in any ring at all, two things "commuting" always refers to multplication.  Ring addition is always commutative, by axiom (and you don't even need that axiom, it's automatic anyway, if the ring has 1).
[23:48:56] <Z-module> So in any ring,  x + y = y + x   for all x,y , but there can exist x,y with  xy != yx
[23:49:05] <Guest54> wait, why is the definition in an ideal on the wiki different than in my book?
[23:49:19] <Z-module> Guest54: you sure it is?
[23:49:22] <qergle> the link i gave is for ideal number

[23:50:11] <Guest54> mine doesn't say "subgroup" and such
[23:50:15] <[-_-]> it seems diagonal of symmetric matrices will have to have the same value of each matrix to have them commute
[23:50:58] <[-_-]> For matrix A all value of main diagonal have to be same say x and for B all of them have to be same also, say y

[23:51:28] <qergle> does it satisfy the group axioms?
[23:51:30] <Z-module> Guest54, that definition there is easily equivalent to the somewhat more usual version:  I is an ideal of R if it is an additive subgroup, and if  ri,  ir  are both in I, for all i in I, all r in R. (We don't bother with ir if the ring is commutative, as the example in your link there is.)
[23:52:11] <Inline> cosets and ideals are not the same right ?
[23:52:26] <Z-module> not at all
[23:52:29] <Inline> ok

[23:52:51] <[-_-]> group axiom?

[23:54:36] <[-_-]> Anyway That was what I found when trying to prove AB=BA
[23:54:42] <cherim> [1, 0; 0, 2] and [3, 0; 0, 4] are symmetric and commute but don't look like you claim
[23:54:43] <qergle> [-_-]: yes, i was suggesting you prove the assertion
[23:54:43] <qergle> you have an iff, but start with one direction: A,B,AB symmetric implies AB=BA
[23:54:43] <Z-module> Guest54, to check that this version here is equivalent, you will need a simple lemma typically done in the first few pages of any expository ring theory source:  Let R be a ring with 1 (most people require 1 to be a ring in the first place). For any r in R, the additive inverse of it, denoted -r, is the same as the ring product  (-1)r   where -1 is the additive inverse of 1.
[23:54:43] <Z-module> More often they give it as:  for all a, b in R,   -(ab) = (-a)b = a(-b)
