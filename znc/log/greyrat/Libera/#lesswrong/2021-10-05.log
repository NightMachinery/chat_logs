[00:44:50] <meowcat> back in the day, if i sent you email, you and i were both part of organizations that had, at most, a few thousand users. and my organization's email server would go talk to your organization's email server, and say "HELO!

[01:37:54] <kuudes> but yes, I too think they are useful
[01:38:02] <kuudes> given I would prefer not to burn while I sleep
[01:39:19] <saturn2> apparently around 2700 deaths per year in the US
[01:40:54] <saturn2> maybe you're right, they're more trouble than they're worth
[01:42:53] <PlanckWalk> At maybe $10M/life as a ballpark cost-to-avert-risk, that's about $9/year.
[01:43:40] <PlanckWalk> (Assuming they were 100% effective, which they aren't)
[01:43:55] <PlanckWalk> $9/person-year that is
[01:44:26] <PlanckWalk> I wonder what the effects are for averting non-lethal risks?
[01:45:00] <PlanckWalk> E.g. waking you up in time to reduce smoke inhalation injury, or to put out a fire while it's small enough to not cause extensive damage?
[01:45:56] <PlanckWalk> There are certainly a lot more than 2700 fires per year, so those might dominate.
[01:46:39] <saturn2> the 2700 is *with* fire alarms though, we don't know what it would be without them
[01:46:46] <PlanckWalk> True
[01:47:23] * PlanckWalk suspects "with fire alarms" includes a great many that haven't been maintained and don't work.
[01:47:44] <PlanckWalk> ... which would still be a point against, if they're too much hassle to keep even minimally maintained.
[01:49:25] <kuudes> indeed the question is what the hypothetical world without or with less fire alarms would look like
[01:51:27] <PlanckWalk> The leading cause of house fires looks like cooking, which fire alarms don't help with at all.
[01:54:15] <PlanckWalk> Yep, which looks backed up in deaths: comparatively very few deaths from those (but a lot of property damage)
[01:58:49] <kuudes> in twitter a person said as response to questioning covid testing usefulness that the other person would not think tsa or fire alarms useful then, so I started to wonder
[01:59:17] <PlanckWalk> From what I've read of TSA, it looks utterly useless.
[01:59:18] <kuudes> though there is the difference, that terrorism does not increase with exponential function
[01:59:28] <kuudes> nor fires, usually
[01:59:48] <kuudes> fires can at most increase to the square
[01:59:56] <PlanckWalk> Fire alarms might or might not be worthwhile.
[02:00:40] <PlanckWalk> By the time fires get to the point of buring other people's houses, you certainly don't need an alarm (and it probably isn't useful for that purpose anyway)
[02:00:42] <saturn2> the TSA is obviously not useful
[02:01:01] <kuudes> tsa would be useful if each terrorist would cause 2 terrorists next week
[02:01:10] <PlanckWalk> Ehh....
[02:01:32] <saturn2> well, maybe
[02:01:40] <PlanckWalk> Maybe they'd actually be competent in that case?  Hard to tell with such a weird hypothetical.
[02:01:51] <kuudes> well, sure, we would soon find out if tsa actually can be useful with any resources, at least
[02:03:05] <kuudes> maybe we would have to put in curfews for flying limiting it to fewer people or something
[02:03:05] <saturn2> it's not so weird, if US bombing and coup plotting causes more terrorism, and more terrorism causes more US bombing and coup plotting
[02:03:24] <kuudes> indeed
[02:03:37] <kuudes> it seems to me that the exponential function is the key difference in these cases
[02:03:45] <two2theheadPC0> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : Human Facial Expression Disgust http://i.ytimg.com/vi/9zopLm5YF-I/hqdefault.jpg
[02:03:53] <kuudes> current model is that there is only a near constant amount of al qaeda likes
[02:04:12] <kuudes> say, 1000 persons
[02:04:21] <kuudes> 10000 tops in the world, I would think
[02:04:49] <kuudes> maybe 100 if we need unabomber competence?
[02:05:18] <kuudes> so if we had no tsa and 100 unabombers would constantly bomb air travel...
[02:05:37] <saturn2> otoh i doubt the TSA would have stopped the 9/11 terrorists
[02:05:44] <kuudes> hmm, the problem is not that they bomb aircraft but that they drive aircraft into targets, and aircraft contains potential energy
[02:06:16] <kuudes> so each unabomber type would somehow be able to drive 1 plane per month into a building? so 3 per day
[02:06:31] <kuudes> 9/11 was 3000 deaths, wasn't it
[02:06:38] <PlanckWalk> There are non-TSA security improvements that were much more effective.
[02:06:41] <kuudes> and we should presume it was on high end of target scale
[02:06:52] <kuudes> so I guess it would be about 3000 deaths per day
[02:07:12] <kuudes> so 1.2 M per year
[02:07:26] <PlanckWalk> Like, locking cabins and changing policy.
[02:07:32] <saturn2> they would fairly quickly run out of skyscrapers
[02:07:46] <kuudes> sure, but nuclear plants and factories
[02:07:46] <PlanckWalk> The policy *used* to be that you comply with their demands.
[02:07:52] <PlanckWalk> It isn't anymore.
[02:08:15] <kuudes> about 1/300 per year
[02:08:24] <kuudes> 0.3%
[02:08:31] <PlanckWalk> So no, totally eliminating TSA would get nowhere near that rate.
[02:08:33] <kuudes> about covid levels I guess, without vaccines?
[02:09:08] <PlanckWalk> Totally eliminating all possible security measures won't even get that rate
[02:09:27] <kuudes> well usa has mass shootings
[02:09:39] <PlanckWalk> Not 3000 people per day
[02:09:51] <kuudes> indeed not
[02:10:00] <two2theheadPC0> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : Correction, the emotion analyzer site says it's anger
[02:10:01] <kuudes> because they have to use handguns instead of bombs or planes
[02:10:19] <PlanckWalk> The problem is that the TSA incompetently prevents a single means of attack that was already prevented by other means.
[02:11:02] <saturn2> fire alarms and the TSA are kind of in different categories, since we know fire alarms at least detect fires but it's questionable whether the TSA even does anything at all
[02:11:08] <kuudes> indeed
[02:11:33] <PlanckWalk> 9/11 only worked because airlines had no idea that it was a possible threat.
[02:11:39] <kuudes> we don't have security checks for trains over here
[02:11:43] <PlanckWalk> 9/12 wouldn't have worked
[02:11:58] <kuudes> well no planes flew on 9/12
[02:12:19] <PlanckWalk> Well yes, *literally* speaking.
[02:12:48] <kuudes> once the literal use of literally :D
[02:13:50] <saturn2> people joked that terrorists could just bomb the TSA waiting line, but that would totally work

At its height circa 1960, this serial about a dashing young fast-draw detective had a print-run of 5000-6000, second in the kashihon market only to Shirato Sanpei‚Äôs The Legend of Kagemaru (1959-62), between 7000
[03:25:21] <feepbot> and 8000. Sait≈ç Pro was founded in the middle of its serialization. When this began I am not sure, but at some point the drawing of Gor≈ç was aided by mechanical reproduction. His head was standardized into four aspects ‚Äì front, side, left ¬æ, and right ¬æ ‚Äì each of which came in five different sizes. These variations were printed in advance and then pasted into the story
[03:25:21] <feepbot> accordingly. Sait≈ç drew in the mouth and eyes afterwards in the appropriate expression. The same method was used by Akatsuka Fujio in Little Osomatsu, serialized in Sh≈çnen Sunday beginning in 1962. In that case, replication is the central conceit of the story, as Osomatsu is one of six identical twins who raise hell with their confusing uniformity. For Sait≈ç, the method was

[10:29:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, earlier. System 6 had it

[10:33:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hard to find screenshots of systems prior to 6... hm, let's see if my books are any help...
[10:39:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have consulted the tomes of ancient wisdom, and they have revealed unto me that the Finder had a list view even at the very beginning of time, in the year 1984, in Macintosh System 1
[10:41:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, you see, there never was any "moving to" a "more Windows-like" tabular display, because the tabular display feature of the Finder predates Windows itself
[10:43:23] <quanticle> Oh
[10:43:53] <quanticle> So I guess I misunderstood spatial finder then. I guess the spatial aspect of it is just that 1 window corresponds to one folder?
[10:46:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure, that's part of it, and also that 1 icon = 1 file = 1 location in 1 window
[10:46:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> And you *can* use "icon" views (instead of "list"), and the positions of icons in those views is remembered
[10:51:27] <quanticle> Okay, so it's more like the OS enforces a 1:1 mapping that allows the user to pretend that the icon is the document
[10:53:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> The document is the document
[10:53:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> There is no pretending
[10:53:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> It has an icon, and also a name

[11:01:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Another way to think of it is: if you arrange the papers in a physical file folder in a certain order, and maintain that order when adding or removing items, and each paper is labeled with a little label that says what is... surely what you have is still a physical file folder with physical pieces of paper in it, right? Merely putting the papers in order can't possibly change that fact, can it?
[11:03:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now, if that file folder, along with its contents, could suddenly be in two places at once, that would be weird, and not very "spatial" at all! Physical objects don't behave that way
[11:05:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Another example of spatiality is: so, the desktop, right? You can have files and folders right there on the desktop, right next to your mounted volumes and so on. Now, if you have a document sitting on the desktop, where is it actually? In the directory structure?
[11:08:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, it's in the folder called "Desktop Folder", on the root level of the [REDACTED] volume. Ok, cool, now, if you open said volume (which is itself sitting on the desktop, as all mounted volumes must), you will not see the Desktop Folder (it's invisible in the Finder), because what if you double-clicked it? Would it open in a window? But then it (and its contents) would be in two places at once...

[16:53:15] <[itchyjunk]> Yes, but memorization wouldn't help I think. I need to read books and do the practice problems probably.
[16:53:30] <rsaarelm> So why don't you ever touch the books?

[16:54:00] <[itchyjunk]> I am not sure.. i try to and get through a page before feeling anxious and never get back to it
[16:54:48] <rsaarelm> So yeah, that sounds like a problem.
[16:55:26] <rsaarelm> Are you genuinely interested in the degree or do you feel like you're just studying for it because you have to?
[16:55:49] <[itchyjunk]> Genuinely interested

[17:03:57] <rsaarelm> I think I've had something similar. I go, "hey, interesting difficult book, time to read", I start reading the book, book is difficult and I haven't done much reading stuff like that, suddenly full anxiety.
[17:04:57] <rsaarelm> I think there are some behaviors I've learned wrong in school behind that. You get basically zero prep all up to high school for reading genuinely difficult stuff.
[17:06:13] <rsaarelm> One problem I have is that I can do "accomplishing work", but that mode works very badly for "exploratory/planning work" where I don't yet know what the concrete steps to proceed are but have some problem or topic to work with.
[17:07:34] <rsaarelm> One simple and stupid trick is to switch from goals to timeboxing for stuff like that, if "solve issue X" is too complex for a single afternoon's work, and you don't know how to split it into subtasks, set a task for something like "poke at issue X for 30 minutes".

[17:12:28] <rsaarelm> [itchyjunk]: I guess if you want to go to grad school then my awesome university education lifehack of "you'll still get your degree even if you completed every course with the lowest passing grade" might be a bit of a problem down the road.
[17:13:20] <[itchyjunk]> right
[17:15:04] <rsaarelm> Though there is a wider idea in it about not taking your education too seriously. Unless you have concrete evidence to the contrary, assume that the curriculum for the degree is designed badly and that the courses have bad pedagogy.
[17:15:20] <kuudes> indeed
[17:15:36] <rsaarelm> And then don't get hung up on not mastering every bit the curriculum asks you to do and don't beat yourself in the head over having lots of trouble understanding what a particular course is trying to teach you.
[17:15:43] <kuudes> I have been thinking that lower tertiary could potentially have better teaching than higher tertiary
[17:16:00] <kuudes> because lower tertiary still has mandatory teaching education requirement
[17:16:40] <rsaarelm> Well, I guess the way to say it is "don't take your *schooling* too seriously", with the quips like "don't let your schooling interfere with your education".
[17:16:57] <kuudes> which sort of is understandable - university (master's degree and further) sort of are of the idea "lets get really distinguished individuals and pay them to be around and get smart students who somehow pump out the knowledge of them
[17:17:54] <kuudes> sort of art-like solution, "we don't know what is the good thing, so lets hope some osmosis happens if we house them and pay them"
[17:18:35] <kuudes> whereas on bachelor level it could be more that we would do stuff like actually optimize lectures with professional video studios etc
[17:19:35] <kuudes> I have been thinking on when we could get differentiation of teaching and measuring on the education system
[17:19:54] <kuudes> ie that we could have general computer aided tests that a different organization makes than the one that teaches
[17:20:21] <rsaarelm> [itchyjunk]: Oh, one more a bit unintuitive thing I think might be important. Do you have stuff related to your study area that you know well enough you can bounce it around in your head without any material at hand. Like, a programmer can think of pointer layout ideas for a data structure in their head without a keyboard or paper at hand after they've worked with it a bit. A number theorist can
[17:20:22] <kuudes> and we could then maybe measure often so that the students and teachers could get signal on the trajectory
[17:20:24] <rsaarelm> probably bounce ideas for doing stuff with prime numbers around. But when I'm studying some difficult new topic, it all lives in the books for a long time at first and I've got very little left in my head I can play around with when I walk away from the book.
[17:21:42] <rsaarelm> I didn't really figure this out until a while into my disaster of a master's thesis, but then I started thinking building those sort of thought balls you can bounce around in your head when you go for a walk or something might be sort of important for getting a hang of a subject.

[17:36:43] <PapuaHardyNet> spaced repetition != clear distillation of ideas
[17:37:00] <PapuaHardyNet> tbh, spaced repetition is useless without a clear distillation of ideas
[17:37:29] <PapuaHardyNet> an ideal data pipeline for understanding involves something like this (books, videos, articles) -> notes -> distilled notes -> SRS flashcards
[17:37:50] <PapuaHardyNet> skipping the distillation bit (aka Woz's first law of SRS) will mess up your SRS habit
[17:38:10] <PapuaHardyNet> (and it is a mistake I keep making even after 7 years of SRSing

[17:56:11] <[itchyjunk]> Oh interesting idea, i'll try it over the weekend
[17:56:52] <[itchyjunk]> They banned anti bacterial soaps because it was applying selective pressure no? How is handsanatizer any different?
[17:57:11] <[itchyjunk]> my school has those 2leter bottles of them everywhere and i see people constantly using it
[17:57:25] <[itchyjunk]> i would have thought the same idea from hand soap would carry over to things like this.
[17:57:37] <[itchyjunk]> I was also wondering about mouth wash.
[17:58:48] <rsaarelm> I'm not a biologist, but hand sanitizer is really heavy duty disinfecting isn't it?
[17:59:06] <[itchyjunk]> Not too sure what is actually is
[17:59:11] <rsaarelm> Like not something you develop antibiotic resistance to, since it's more like just smashing cells with a chemical hammer instead of doing clever stuff.
[17:59:17] <[itchyjunk]> I know it supposidly kill 99.9% of something
[17:59:19] <rsaarelm> I thought it was usually just alcohol?
[17:59:27] <rsaarelm> Plus something to make it a bit more gelatinous.
[17:59:41] <[itchyjunk]> Hm, how did anti bacterial soaps work then?
[17:59:58] <[itchyjunk]> introduced anti biotics in some capacity?
[18:00:52] <rsaarelm> Looks like they just use some different chemical agent that I guess is less harsh on your hands?

[18:04:51] <[itchyjunk]> Although, i wonder if that is still happening
[18:05:20] <kuudes> soap is effective and enough against covid. it destroys the lipid part of the virus afaik, and removes viruses from the washed area

[18:11:55] <PapuaHardyNet> a shower, for some reason, increases my physiological energy levels
[18:12:27] <PapuaHardyNet> showering is probably a good leisure activity. The question is: is showering more than once a day bad?
[18:12:37] <feep> home~!
[18:15:36] <[itchyjunk]> I would imagine it is bad if you use hot water + soap and such.
[18:16:10] <nshepperd2> "Antibacterial soaps have the potential to create antibiotic-resistant bacteria." uhh, why would they be using any kind of "antibiotic"
[18:16:12] <[itchyjunk]> All those long hair/ long beard "tips" say you shouldn't wash hair with products more than once every 2 days
[18:16:23] <nshepperd2> you're not eating the soup to kill bacteria
[18:16:39] <[itchyjunk]> the bacteria on the skin.
[18:16:48] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm. lukewarm shower without shampoo and soap then.
[18:16:54] <[itchyjunk]> if whatever chemical they are claiming works better than regular soap doesn't kill 100% of them
[18:17:06] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd2: people's skin always has bacteria and fungi on them
[18:17:10] <nshepperd2> yes
[18:17:22] <nshepperd2> you don't need 'antibiotics' to kill bacteria on the skin
[18:17:42] <[itchyjunk]> the claim isn't that they are using antibiotics, that was a possibility
[18:17:46] <nshepperd2> bc it doesn't need to be selective, nor to survive being in someone's body
[18:17:51] <[itchyjunk]> they claim their products works better than regular soap
[18:17:57] <[itchyjunk]> so it has to be soap + something else
[18:18:02] <kuudes> are you guys talking about showers or handwashing?
[18:18:12] <nshepperd2> bacteria are unlikely to develop a meaningful resistance to, say, silver
[18:18:16] <[itchyjunk]> and if the something else doesn't kill everything, why shouldn't bacteria develop resistance to something else?
[18:18:29] <[itchyjunk]> handwashing in shower!
[18:18:36] <kuudes> PapuaHardyNet, staying in water seems nice
[18:18:51] <kuudes> I like the theory that humans are river monkeys
[18:19:20] <kuudes> that would explain the erect posture etc
[18:23:19] <rsaarelm> Fun fact, human toes and fingers getting wrinkly in water isn't a direct physical effect from getting wet, it takes a neural signal to happen and won't work if you have paralysis.
[18:23:44] <rsaarelm> So it's a specific adaptation to get more traction for your fingers and toes if you're in a wet environment.
[18:27:09] <nshepperd2> imagine having direct conscious control over wrinkling
[18:27:44] <nshepperd2> wrinkling your hands at someone could be some kind of insult
[18:28:11] <PapuaHardyNet> I thought people wanted to be less wrinkly?
