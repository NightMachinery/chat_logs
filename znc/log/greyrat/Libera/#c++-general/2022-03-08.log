[00:10:16] <PJBoy> the fact that it has std::vector and no std::matrix though D:
[00:10:38] <rpav> std::matrix would likely be terrible anyway
[00:10:46] <LordKalma> hhaha the std:: library doesn't care for anything that's not 1D
[00:11:47] <PJBoy> it really doesn't
[00:12:15] <rpav> it would probably be written in a way (i.e., generalized to MxN) making it useless for GL math (because it was slow), and not useful/optimized _enough_ for big math (1k x 1k matrices or whatever)
[00:12:39] <Alipha> LordKalma: test1 has 10 extra lines of assembly, it looks like: https://godbolt.org/z/hP7KzzWa4
[00:13:03] <PJBoy> std::matrix obviously wouldn't be used for matrix maths

[00:13:45] <PJBoy> you try making a half-decent language in less than 40 years

[00:53:12] <johnny> there's a long standing issue with power draw when using their BLE implementation on nordic chips
[00:54:47] <johnny> nordic actually shipped boards with their uhmm.. copilot chip in the nrf51 era. it presented a usb mass storage device so you could compile the software and just drag and drop or otherwise copy the binary to the device and it would flash it for you
[00:55:21] <johnny> but nordic stopped their cooperation in favor of using the C solution via the zephyr OS
[00:55:55] <johnny> it kinda makes sense though, since nordic used to provide a whole SDK that acted as an os, so instead now they just rely on zephyr with some wrappers around it

[01:59:33] <c4017w_> Should I make a member function const if it only modifies external data, not the classes own members? Specifically its a GPIO pin class. Idk if the functions that configure the pin and changes its state should be made const
[01:59:35] <bobb_> Hi, lets say we have https://godbolt.org/z/hWT9cGrbd i.e. just the name of X is hashed. When the name is not guaranteed to be unique but the triple consisting of name, description and tag is, does anything speak against "concatenating" all three?
[02:00:05] <LordKalma> c4017w_ but does it even read any member?
[02:00:14] <LordKalma> mark const if it reads members, mark static if it doesn't
[02:00:38] <LordKalma> also, consider namespaces instead of classes for group functionality without state
[02:00:55] <c4017w_> yes, it reads and modifies the memory mapped GPIO pointer

[02:01:18] <c4017w_> which I store as a member of the class
[02:01:34] <LordKalma> if you modify it, how can you say "only modifies external data, not the classes own members"?
[02:01:44] <LordKalma> you just contradicted yourself
[02:01:52] <kalven> bobb_: if you want the hash values for those two to be more likely to differ, then yeah you should include all the fields when hashing
[02:02:05] <c4017w_> well it doesn't modify the pointer, just the data pointed too. That's where I'm confused
[02:02:16] <Alipha> bobb_: unless you're using a cryptographic hash such as sha256, the hash value isn't guaranteed to be different anyway
[02:02:16] <LordKalma> ah then you can use const

[02:08:53] <Alipha> i'd say probably just ^ them
[02:11:17] <Alipha> multiplication also produces some other non-uniform results. for instance, assuming there's a 1/2 chance that low is even and a 1/2 chance that high is even, there's a 3/4 chance that low * high is even
[02:11:47] <kalven> alternatively, just use the 32-bit version of fnv1 if you want to produce a 32-bit hash (instead of the 64-bit version which is used here)
[02:12:02] <bobb_> Alipha good point
[02:13:20] <bobb_> didn't really thought about it as the code already exists, but i may change everything
[02:13:54] <kalven> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function
[02:14:23] <bobb_> kalven yeah you are right, i should consider using the 32-bit version

[15:21:10] <PJBoy> terrible
[15:21:30] <PJBoy> this is why programmers use more than one letter for variables
[15:21:39] <LordKalma> hahah
[15:22:13] <LordKalma> anyway, what do you think, at first sight, without many semantic considerations, given it's not tested yet
[15:22:58] <PJBoy> at a glance?
[15:23:45] <very_sneaky> the polar form of the trig functions is pretty useful

[15:27:45] <PJBoy> ideally you'd be able to write `std::span<fcomplex_t>` for output and `std::span<const fcomplex_t>` for input
[15:28:31] <LordKalma> ah yes, that's right
[15:28:40] <PJBoy> when you have a non-const input, there's always a question of if that parameter is an in-out parameter

[15:29:33] <LordKalma> it's not horrible
[15:29:43] <LordKalma> it does fuck all in the twiddle computation, but the FFT is decent as well

[15:31:04] <PJBoy> the computeTwiddleFactors has that insane vector operation loop
[15:31:16] <LordKalma> on clang?
[15:31:27] <PJBoy> yeah
[15:31:37] <LordKalma> btw, use clang 13, not trunk

[15:32:19] <PJBoy> good call

[15:37:17] <PJBoy> wow
[15:37:20] <LordKalma> From c++17 yes
[15:37:50] <PJBoy> you can calculate how much to reserve up front, right?
[15:38:02] <PJBoy> it's just size()+i/2

[15:38:15] <PJBoy> erm
[15:38:35] <PJBoy> bah it's some sum I can

[15:38:53] <PJBoy> oh really
[15:38:57] <LordKalma> No, sorry
[15:39:08] <PJBoy> oh yeah right, that twiddle_factors_m is in a loop, so it should be i/2 after all
[15:39:27] <LordKalma> twiddle_factors is log2(size), and twiddle_factors_m is i/2
[15:39:27] <PJBoy> I can't get over that emplace_back return value

[15:40:52] <PJBoy> but I might switch to this now
[15:41:06] <LordKalma> Let it be remembered the day I taught PJBoy something
[15:41:23] <PJBoy> yeah I'm glad I reviewed the code now
[15:42:57] <PJBoy> also C++ supports unicode identifiers
[15:43:08] <PJBoy> so clearly you should be writing y_ωnk
[15:43:31] <LordKalma> Twiddle factors are actually identified with uppercase W

[17:44:25] <LordKalma> "worked for me, so there mustn't be any issues"
[17:44:40] <gehn> yeah, generally it would be expected that Linux on most laptops will be some % fail
[17:44:44] <Friithian> PJBoy: yes, but the laptop before wasn't and had no issues also
[17:44:45] <gehn> unless it's a thinkpad
[17:44:49] <rpav> part of the deal is you have to make a _fair_ comparison, i.e. not "preinstalled windows" vs "repartition and fit linux in too" which is pretty easy, but definitely requires doing things like acknowledging disk partitioning exists ;)
[17:44:52] <gehn> Friithian, that's rare
[17:45:04] <PJBoy> windows setup is significantly harder if you include the bit where you disable as much telemetry and bloatware as possible
[17:45:11] <LordKalma> rpav this laptop didn't even came with a windows licence
[17:45:18] <rpav> windows setup is harder if you want anything other than preinstalled
[17:45:29] <rpav> even on a fresh / pristine system
[17:45:32] <LordKalma> windows has too many questions during the setup, I'll give you that
[17:45:35] <gehn> shit support for Linux on (most) laptops is why vendors like System 76 exist
[17:45:41] <PJBoy> too many questions?

[17:45:56] <LordKalma> other than that, it's better in terms of configurations, like
[17:46:03] <rpav> it just has more steps and rebooting and bullshit, where ubuntu at least is pretty much "run the installer, click through, bam working"

[17:46:15] <very_sneaky> i think arguing that linux has zero cli configuration requirements is a losing one. I'm sure someone has done it, but it's probably not the majority of use cases

[17:46:30] <very_sneaky> linux is objectively better though

[17:46:54] <gehn> very_sneaky, objectively better for developers, yes I mostly agree
[17:46:58] <rpav> linux has to post-install manually, but the default stuff gets you as far as a gui at least
[17:47:06] <gehn> objectively better for most average non technical users? I'm not so sure on that one

[17:52:10] <LordKalma> hah I have a bunch of those as well
[17:52:17] <gehn> LordKalma, sort of bound to the hardware (talking pre Win 11), in that you can't have two windows systems with the same activation key booted and on the internet at the same time

[17:52:56] <gehn> rpav, probably agree
[17:52:57] <rpav> not upgrading until i must, if ever
[17:53:10] <gehn> haven't moved to 11 and I'm not looking forward to it so far based on what I've seen
[17:53:49] <gehn> TPM itself isn't necessarily evil, just that it has the potential for abuse by evil doers
[17:53:51] <rpav> mostly it comes down to some 3D tools (zbrush, 3dcoat, ...) and music stuff (komplete, performer, ...)
[17:54:15] <gehn> I don't know that things like full drive encryption really work without TPM or something like it
[17:54:22] <rpav> gehn: if it was like, "i'm installing linux on this with TPM" then i'd be like ok
[17:54:37] <rpav> but if the first step is "install windows" then you've gone from zero to evil in 300ms

[18:07:58] <rpav> i mean in that ECS is compositional yes, but it's also complicated and blackboxy
[18:08:17] <rpav> i'm not sure you can't do similar with simpler templates tbh
[18:08:17] <Raziel> I dunno, the one I'm using uses templates for components

[20:14:22] <kenanmarasli> for learning purposes I have created a diamond shape inheritance: A, B->A, C->A, D->B&C, and I want to get the A part via D->B->A path, question is that can I do this through scope resolution? I tried stuff like `C c; A* pa = &(c::B::A)` or `B::A* pa = &c;` I can do it in two steps like `B* pb = &c; A* pa = pb;`
[20:14:57] <kenanmarasli> I realize that it doesn't make much sense, and two steps look OK, but I still wonder if there is something like that
[20:16:47] <ville> umm... c does not have a B subobject
[20:17:07] <rpav> with a field `x` in `A`, and an instance `D d`, you can get it by `d.B::x` or `d.C::x`
[20:17:08] <kenanmarasli> you are right, I meant is as D d
[20:19:02] <rpav> i'm not sure how you get at shadowed base members

[20:21:58] <kenanmarasli> I see, resolving base member name through `d.B::x` or `d.C::x` made me curious if same could be applied for repeated bases
[20:22:53] <rpav> _can_ you access shadowed data members? 🤔
[20:23:36] *** Joins: ivii (~ivan@user/ivii)
[20:24:03] <rpav> in this case, i guess .. seems to find d.B::A::x an ambiguous path to `x` even though it's explicitly B::A
[20:24:19] <PJBoy> { DD dd; B* p_dd_d0_b = static_cast<D0*>(&dd); SHOW(p_dd_d0_b->x); } struct B { int x = 0; }; struct D0 : B { int x = 1; }; struct D1 : B { int x = 2; }; struct DD : D0, D1 { int x = 3; };
[20:24:19] <geordi> p_dd_d0_b->x = 0
[20:24:25] <PJBoy> is how I would think to do that
[20:24:57] <rpav> well without casting but yeah
[20:25:25] <rpav> you can always `static_cast<B&>(d).A::x = 42;` or whatever
[20:25:33] <PJBoy> you need the cast to say which branch of inheritance to go down
[20:25:40] <rpav> which is probably not any more terrible than the entire hierarchy going on
[20:26:28] <ashafq> LordKalma: Is there a C++ library to dump tables on the terminal?
[20:26:39] <PJBoy> what kind of table?

[20:27:36] <rpav> kenanmarasli: permissive compiler?
[20:28:00] <PJBoy> d.B::A::x should definitely be ambiguous if A is inherited elsewhere
[20:28:15] <PJBoy> B::A is just a long way of spelling A, so it should be ambiguous
[20:28:59] <PJBoy> ashafq, wow that's pretty good, dang
[20:29:03] <kenanmarasli> I don't get it, aren't there two x names in object of D, one is from B's A and other C's A?
[20:29:18] <kenanmarasli> why would it be ambigious?
[20:29:32] <rpav> kenanmarasli: this assumes that `B::A` means something sane like "A as inherited by B" and not something ridiculous like "A"
[20:29:45] <PJBoy> B::A just names a type
[20:29:54] <rpav> never assume C++ does the useful thing
[20:29:58] <PJBoy> it doesn't specify a branch of inheritance to travel through
[20:30:04] <PJBoy> that's what casts are for
[20:30:11] <kenanmarasli> ah, I get it
[20:30:19] <PJBoy> { DD dd; SHOW(dd.D0::B::x); } struct B { int x = 0; }; struct D0 : B { int x = 1; }; struct D1 : B { int x = 2; }; struct DD : D0, D1 { int x = 3; };
[20:30:19] <geordi> error: 'B' is an ambiguous base of 'DD'
[20:30:29] <kenanmarasli> it just resolves to type A, doesn't point to that member x
[20:30:38] <PJBoy> yeah
[20:30:46] <kenanmarasli> that's unexpected tbh
[20:30:59] <rpav> moral: diamond inheritance is bad
[20:31:09] <kenanmarasli> well, good to know thank you
[20:31:11] <PJBoy> tell that to std::iostream
[20:31:27] <kenanmarasli> yeah :D bad diamond
[20:31:29] <rpav> iostreams is definitely pretty bad, and not in a good way
[20:31:35] <PJBoy> :)

[20:32:22] <rpav> it doesn't need inheritance at all
[20:32:37] <PJBoy> nothing needs anything

[22:07:12] <PJBoy> worth checking if someone submitted a bug report to gcc

[22:08:45] <kenanmarasli> thinking of whether it should point to correct member or not, to me it looks like the intention is clear when typed like `d.C::i`

[22:30:00] <geordi> Same error.
[22:30:15] <PJBoy> would you agree that's the same case as before more-or-less?
[22:31:01] <PJBoy> where the ambiguity is between `dd.D::B::x` and `dd.B::x` this time
[22:31:45] <kenanmarasli> hmm
[22:32:08] <PJBoy> because https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/1119.html seems to address that one
[22:32:29] <PJBoy> (also it works in visual studio)
[22:32:36] <kenanmarasli> I think it means the show func should output 1
[22:32:47] <kenanmarasli> alright checking
[22:32:56] <PJBoy> I agree that that would be reasonable
[22:33:05] <PJBoy> but it seems like it's intended to be ambiguous
[22:34:20] <PJBoy> although that CWG's example only points out that `d.B::x` should be ambiguous
[22:34:27] <kenanmarasli> yes the link you sent links to here: https://eel.is/c++draft/class.access.base#6

[22:36:07] <PJBoy> it's hard to interpret the standard
[22:36:14] <PJBoy> but that example seems reasonably clear
[22:36:31] <kenanmarasli> yeah, good find PJBoy
[22:36:35] <kenanmarasli> thanks for looking into this
[22:37:05] <rpav> the C++ standard could boostrap itself, and then compile itself definitively 🤔
[22:37:07] <PJBoy> time to submit a bug to visual studio, see what they think

[22:40:55] <kenanmarasli> how can you be explicit in that problem though?
[22:41:35] <kenanmarasli> C::B::A makes sense and quite clear but if C::B is ambigious, then how can that be expressed?
[22:44:01] <PJBoy> you know what though
[22:44:11] <PJBoy> MSVC is just completely wrong hahaha
[22:44:12] <PJBoy> https://godbolt.org/z/EfqEjTMnj
[22:44:29] <PJBoy> that is unambiguously ambiguous
[22:46:03] <kenanmarasli> nice tool
[22:47:09] <kenanmarasli> you are right, that is ambigious
[22:47:20] <PJBoy> yeah there's no question with that one
[22:48:34] <kenanmarasli> maybe they think that "everyone should be able to code!" and allow some errors :P
[22:55:01] <PJBoy> here's the bug for it fyi https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Ambiguous-access-of-method-is-not-diagno/1383310
