[00:00:57] <gwozniak> gerikson: the thing is.... Computer Modern is kinda ugly
[00:01:23] <gwozniak> chasing down some more Makefile annoyances
[00:01:24] <gwozniak> weee
[00:01:36] * gwozniak shakes fist at the GNU build system
[00:04:40] <gerikson> agree gwozniak
[00:04:44] <companion_cube> you can use other fonts with LaTeX though!
[00:04:49] <gerikson> I used to like PAlatino in TeX
[00:04:56] <gerikson> now, not so much
[00:05:18] <gwozniak> I certainly didn't use Computer Modern for my stuff.  I think I used Palatino or Garamond
[00:06:20] <gerikson> I wonder when books started to state typefaces in their colophones
[00:07:04] *** bontaq` is now known as bontaq
[00:07:18] <gwozniak> I first time I remember seeing it was recently (like, last 15 years or so)
[00:07:44] <gwozniak> But I didn't care about the colophone until about 20 years ago
[00:08:10] <gerikson> I haven't purchased a physical book in ages
[00:08:29] <manicennui> I can't stop myself.
[00:09:37] <gwozniak> I love reading physical books
[00:09:56] <gwozniak> I've tried ereaders and everything.  I can never get into it
[00:10:10] <gwozniak> Maybe an e-ink screen would change my mind
[00:10:21] <manicennui> I still find a fair number of books that are only available physically.
[00:10:59] <gerikson> I love reading books but I don't like owning them
[00:11:11] <gerikson> libraries are great for that
[00:11:24] <gwozniak> Kindle, iPad, some other Kindle-like thing, laptop... just can't do it
[00:11:30] <gerikson> unfortunately I'm a bit too far away from the library with the awesome SF selection
[00:11:42] <gerikson> gwozniak: I'm ok with iphone/ipad
[00:11:43] <gwozniak> gerikson: my local library so often doesn't have the books I'm looking for
[00:11:57] <gwozniak> And I live right near one, too
[00:12:30] <Brekkjern> Kindle's are great, but only the ones with e-ink displays.
[00:13:05] <gwozniak> I also like the people at my local bookstore
[00:15:32] <gerikson> I'm reading a book from 1965
[00:15:59] <gerikson> this Swedish "character author" Alf Henriksson, with a really inimitable style
[00:16:10] <gerikson> I think he's deeply out of fashion now
[00:17:09] <manicennui> Have any SF authors from that era survived unscathed?
[00:17:14] <manicennui> Maybe the women.
[00:17:57] <ngoldbaum> whelp you’re all out or a job https://twitter.com/deepmind/status/1488907829276725252
[00:17:57] <buttsbot> Twatter - deepmind - Introducing #AlphaCode: a system that can compete at average human level in competitive coding competitions like @codeforces. ...
[00:18:34] <companion_cube> but not you, ngoldbaum? :)
[00:18:59] <gerikson> manicennui: have your read Simak?
[00:19:00] * manicennui encourages competitors to replace their developers with AI
[00:19:00] <buttsbot> 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏
[00:19:03] <gerikson> I used to enjoy him a lot
[00:19:04] <manicennui> gerikson: Nope.
[00:19:07] <ngoldbaum> can’t be out of a job without a job to start with :p
[00:19:09] <gerikson> but I think he's really unfashioable now
[00:21:02] <gerikson> manicennui: how about Bester? The Stars My Destination?
[00:21:07] <gerikson> it's excellent
[00:21:19] <manicennui> I honestly haven't read much in a long time.
[00:21:24] <manicennui> Every couple of years I read a handful of books.
[00:21:32] <manicennui> Haven't read many books that is.
[00:21:36] <manicennui> I read a lot of other things.
[00:22:17] <gerikson> I read if I find the time/place
[00:22:22] <gerikson> which I usually don't, right now
[00:22:28] <gerikson> I have a short commute and it's broken up
[00:22:42] <gerikson> so listening to a podcast / music works better for me
[00:22:52] <gerikson> but I read every damn comment on lobste.rs
[00:25:18] <ngoldbaum> ah good one of the NM senators had a stroke
[00:26:00] <ngoldbaum> who could have predicted one of a bunch of old people might get sick
[00:31:03] <gwozniak> Isn't the average age something like "I was alive when the telephone was invented" years old?

[00:48:33] <imode> well.
[00:48:35] <imode> fun times.
[00:49:02] <manicennui> Someone in our all hands just said, "You cannot manage what you don't measure."
[00:49:16] <gerikson> don't uncork what you can't contain
[00:49:24] <gerikson> wait that's a Suzanne Vega song
[00:49:25] <ngoldbaum> quick services are down so mods are dead
[00:49:32] <ngoldbaum> anarchy in libera
[00:49:37] <drakonis> no mods no masters
[00:49:40] <gerikson> this is fascinating https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiqua%E2%80%93Fraktur_dispute#20th_century
[00:49:40] <buttsbot> Antiqua–Fraktur dispute - Wikipedia
[00:49:43] * manicennui nick collides kline
[00:49:52] <kline> aaaaaaaaaa
[00:51:27] <imode> no chanserv.
[00:51:29] <imode> RIOT.
[00:51:41] <manicennui> Typographical disputes. Sweet.
[00:51:51] <manicennui> The Antiqua–Fraktur dispute was a typographical dispute in 19th- and early 20th-century Germany.
[00:51:54] <manicennui> I find that hilarious.
[00:52:04] <manicennui> These are the disputes that we should be having.
[00:52:13] <kline> https://i.imgflip.com/63prxs.jpg
[00:52:21] <manicennui> "Biden supports Helvetica!"
[00:52:23] <gerikson> weirdly it was the nazis who abolished Fraktur
[00:52:43] <manicennui> You know Trump would be an Arial guy.
[00:52:47] <gerikson> manicennui: I don't trust peopel who like sans-setif
[00:53:06] <gerikson> nah he wants something that looks old and luxurious
[00:53:16] <manicennui> gerikson: I've always liked a combination of the two, but serif for text I must read.
[00:53:24] <manicennui> There is a famous foundry that has great examples of this...
[00:55:04] <manicennui> It is Hoefler & Co.
[00:55:09] <manicennui> Their site is a bit different now.
[00:55:22] <gerikson> manicennui: yeah I'm pretty trad, sans-serif for headings, serif for body
[00:55:27] <gerikson> yeah
[00:55:32] <gerikson> they're kinda famous
[00:55:54] <manicennui> They used to have really great examples of font pairings.
[00:57:15] <manicennui> Ah, it is at the very bottom.

[00:57:33] <manicennui> Used to be different.
[01:01:20] <manicennui> gerikson: Are you aware of Matthew Butt­erick?
[01:01:59] <manicennui> He wrote a publishing system in Racket and produces things like this: https://beautifulracket.com/

[01:05:47] <manicennui> Typography is very interesting. I do wonder how much the need to make money influences their work though.
[01:06:08] <manicennui> Like would foundries create so many different fonts if it weren't for the need to make money?
[01:06:17] <manicennui> Or would they have like 10 great fonts?
[01:12:17] <manicennui> Lotta pressure. You gotta rise above it. You gotta harness in the good energy, block out the bad. Harness. Energy. Block. Bad. Feel the flow. Feel it. It's circular. It's like a carousel. You pay the quarter, you get on the horse, it goes up and down, and AROUND. It's circular. Circle, with the music, the flow. All good things.

[01:16:40] <manicennui> I read The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and a few of his other works. I enjoyed them.
[01:17:16] <manicennui> I don't think they are the only real SF.
[01:17:29] <manicennui> I get that there are certain libertarian types who do.
[01:18:23] <gerikson> yeah I was thinking of the Sad Puppies when I wrote thta
[01:18:28] <manicennui> I don't even know that all of those people really agree with his ideals.

[01:19:00] <gerikson> I should read late Heinlein
[01:19:02] <manicennui> Stranger in a Strange Land was very counter culture when released.
[01:19:07] <gerikson> also I should read Stranger...
[01:19:12] <manicennui> Today that isn't really clear.
[01:19:17] <bkero> Hahahaha late Heinlein
[01:19:29] <gerikson> supposedly he suffered a stroke
[01:19:44] <bkero> and a perversion
[01:19:45] <gerikson> an started to write about people having sex iwth their daughters?
[01:19:48] <gerikson> I dunno
[01:20:39] <bkero> I have a physical copy of https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/912504.The_Sensuous_Dirty_Old_Man
[01:20:40] <buttsbot> The Sensuous Dirty Old Man by Isaac Asimov
[01:20:41] <manicennui> There is the one book where the main character is trans, and their own parents or something.
[01:20:51] <manicennui> And time traveling.
[01:21:16] <bkero> Futurama did it
[01:21:35] <gerikson> ``In 1980 Robert Heinlein was a member of the Citizens Advisory Council on National Space Policy, chaired by Jerry Pournelle, which met at the home of SF writer Larry Niven to write space policy papers for the incoming Reagan Administration.''
[01:21:36] <manicennui> Heinlein predates Futurama by a bit.

[01:23:07] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_You_Zombies
[01:23:07] <buttsbot> All You Zombies - Wikipedia
[01:23:35] <manicennui> "'—All You Zombies—'" chronicles a young man (later revealed to be intersex) taken back in time and tricked into impregnating his younger, female self (before he underwent sexual reassignment surgery); he turns out to be the offspring of that union, with the paradoxical result that he is his own mother and father. As the story unfolds, all the major characters are revealed to be the same person, at different stages of
[01:23:35] <manicennui> their life.
[01:23:49] <gerikson> https://ansible.uk/writing/numbeast.html
[01:23:57] <gerikson> this looks like a good read
[01:24:33] <bkero> Wow that's some bonghits.
[01:25:34] <manicennui> I think I've read Stranger in a Strange Land, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, and Starship Troopers.
[01:25:56] <manicennui> And all of them about 15 years ago.
[01:26:34] <manicennui> I think he writes entertaining stories with something to think about. but not necessarily agree with.
[01:26:44] <manicennui> But he isn't a great writer from a literary standpoint.
[01:26:59] <manicennui> He often (always?) uses the device of having a character that is obviously him.
[01:27:24] <manicennui> It won't be the main character, but it will be a wise character who has long passages of dialogue.
[01:27:52] <manicennui> I find it helpful to read such things to clarify my own thinking.
[01:28:07] <manicennui> But I also can see how young men are sucked into it naively.
[01:28:31] <manicennui> Sex is definitely something that plays a big part in his works.
[01:28:39] <manicennui> Lot of polygamy and such.
[01:29:18] <manicennui> Starship Troopers is very different from the movie.
[01:38:19] <manicennui> My take at the time is that he thought military service was very important, and I believe in the book you aren't even a citizen if you don't serve.

[03:22:06] <manicennui> WASHINGTON (AP) — The Army said Wednesday it will immediately begin discharging soldiers who have refused to get the mandatory COVID-19 vaccine, putting more than 3,300 service members at risk of being thrown out soon.
[03:22:47] <CHUD> if you wanted an out, you have it
[03:22:59] <manicennui> Hopefully it is a dishonorable discharge.

[03:26:31] *** Joins: jj5 (~jj5@211-26-131-173.dyn.dodo.net.au)
[03:29:13] <CHUD> why dishonourable?
[03:29:46] <gwozniak> For not following orders, I expect
[03:30:48] <CHUD> well I wouldn't want for them to suffer for the rest of the careers with that black mark on their record
[03:32:13] <manicennui> The Army has said that more than 3,000 soldiers have been issued official written reprimands, which suggests they are already identified in the disciplinary process, and some of them could be among the first to be discharged.
[03:32:21] <manicennui> Their career is over
[03:32:32] <manicennui> You don't get back into the Army after being discharged
[03:34:04] <gwozniak> 3300 people in the army is probably a very small percentage, too
[03:39:04] <manicennui> CHUD: These people need a harsh lesson, but they probably still won't learn.
[03:40:09] <manicennui> At worst they won't list their service on their resume for future employers.
[03:40:23] <manicennui> Frankly, I would never give preference to those who served anyways.
[03:40:43] <manicennui> I'm not sure if it is common to do so outside of jobs where you are trying to impress other people who served.
[03:40:49] <CHUD> manicennui: why do they need harsh lessons?
[03:41:16] <manicennui> CHUD: Because what they are doing is dumb and due to bad mental patterns that need correcting.
[03:42:07] <CHUD> it's a private medical descision
[03:42:22] <manicennui> No, it isn't.
[03:42:47] <manicennui> Do you realize how many other vaccines are required in the military?
[03:42:48] <CHUD> Yes it is, you shouldn't be forced to have anything injected into your body
[03:43:18] <edk> you shouldn't be forced to ingest other people's exhaled viral particles either
[03:43:22] <CHUD> Yes, I am sure there are other vaccines they have taken
[03:43:49] <CHUD> edk: you may as well never leave your home in that case
[03:44:41] <edk> well, why is my freedom to not breathe in viruses less important than some other person's freedom to not be vaccinated?
[03:44:47] <edk> can't that person stay at home?
[03:45:12] <manicennui> They also aren't being forced.
[03:45:16] <CHUD> they could, you could both stay at home if you like
[03:45:23] <manicennui> The options are be vaccinated or don't be part of the military.
[03:45:44] <CHUD> whatever you want to do you should do it within the confines of the law, I wouldn't want you getting into trouble
[03:46:16] <CHUD> that's fine, if they want to leave over this so be it, what's the big deal
[03:46:24] <edk> oh, that rules out the killing spree i had planned for sunday
[03:46:33] <CHUD> wtf
[03:47:16] <edk> anyway i don't think going near other people while unvaccinated is a neutral act
[03:47:32] <edk> people shouldn't presume the freedom to be a public safety hazard
[03:47:44] <edk> (or a military safety hazard)
[03:48:14] <edk> also like people joining the military signed up to be injected with lead by enemy soldiers
[03:49:42] <manicennui> These people always believe that only the people they agree with should have freedom.
[03:49:54] <manicennui> No one they interact with should have freedom.
[03:50:17] <manicennui> "I should be able to be unvaccinated, and I should be able to force employers to employ me or force the military to keep me."

[03:51:04] <manicennui> "They should have no choice, only I should."
[03:55:15] <manicennui> It's exactly the same with the "free speech" on social media nonsense.
[03:55:47] <manicennui> And they prove it when they form their own networks and then ban and censor anyone who disagrees with them.
[03:59:10] <gwozniak> They should be kicked out of the military for not complying and we shouldn't feel bad for them
[04:02:09] <manicennui> I don't
[04:03:04] <manicennui> I don't know who CHUD is, but I'm guessing he is a bit of an anti-vaxxer free speech tard
[04:09:20] <edk> i obviously reacted to a similar sort of guess, but it wasn't entirely fair of either of us to assume
[04:10:09] <edk> some people say things that happen to be anti-vaxxer muh freedom idiot talking points without actually being anti-vaxxer muh freedom idiots
[04:16:00] <manicennui> When is the last time you encountered one of those people who didn't have the same collection of bad takes?
[04:16:27] <manicennui> They're just being disingenuous. It has nothing to do with their rationales.
[04:16:34] <manicennui> It's a collection of positions that they parrot.
[04:16:43] <manicennui> They didn't reason their way into them.

[20:48:50] <manicennui> That this shit exists at all is the fucking dumbest crap imaginable.
[20:49:00] <imode> I built one of those.
[20:49:12] <manicennui> Down with imode!
[20:49:27] <imode> we had a three phase installed in the warehouse.

[20:51:49] <manicennui> I bet that CFO is doing fine somewhere else.
[20:52:16] <imode> I can confirm he isn't.
[20:52:45] <imode> that company was fuckin' small, on the order of maybe 8 people.
[20:54:26] <imode> we built a multisig wallet, bought a warehouse to do the "mining" in, built a large cooperative mining pool and were working on clockless mining ASICs.
[20:56:08] <imode> that last part would have tried to cut down on the waste heat, and therefore the electricity burn. but the whole thing went bust before we were able to actually start using them.

[21:19:03] <manicennui> I really hate the touchbar.
[21:21:21] <cb> interesting concept but it needed more iteration that it... didn't get
[21:21:47] <manicennui> I don't want more touchscreens.
[21:21:51] <manicennui> Touchscreens blow.
[21:22:00] <manicennui> We use them on phones because they are the best compromise.
[21:22:17] <imode> I was perfectly okay with physical switches on a phone.
[21:23:41] <manicennui> The Sidekick was probably the direction things should have gone.
[21:23:45] <manicennui> That format was popular for a bit.
[21:23:54] <manicennui> But the iPhone pretty much destroyed everything else.
[21:24:29] <imode> form over function.
[21:24:30] <manicennui> The first Android phone was similar to the Sidekick/Hiptop.
[21:24:35] <imode> pesky buttons, sfft.
[21:24:44] <gwozniak> What was the
[21:24:46] <gwozniak> Sidekick?
[21:24:49] <manicennui> imode: For web surfing and maps and a few other things the touchscreen was superior though.
[21:24:55] <imode> true.

[21:24:59] <imode> you could've gone with a combo.
[21:25:18] <manicennui> Yeah, that is basically what the G1 was.
[21:25:24] <manicennui> If I remember correctly.
[21:25:32] <imode> everybody had to compete with apple.
[21:26:01] <manicennui> The G1 was garbage from a quality standpoint though.
[21:26:08] <manicennui> Apple destroyed everyone in build quality.
[21:26:08] <gwozniak> While I greatly dislike typing for extended periods on a touchscreen, it is superior when you have to type in multiple languages
[21:26:10] <manicennui> Still mostly does.
[21:26:36] <manicennui> gwozniak: We only use God's language in the US.

[21:28:34] <gwozniak> My laptop has a touchscreen and I never use it
[21:28:57] <manicennui> Yeah, I don't get the affinity that some Windows people have for touchscreens.
[21:29:09] <manicennui> In an OS where absolutely nothing is designed for touchscreens.
[21:29:52] <manicennui> At least in OS X some functionality is basically already touchscreen friendly because of the extensive use of gestures and such.
[21:30:01] <manicennui> The trackpad is basically a touchscreen.
[21:30:35] <gerikson> it's weird Apple hasn't gone toucshcreen for macosx
[21:30:42] <manicennui> I'm glad Apple has not gone down the touchscreen on laptop route.
[21:30:48] <gerikson> guess when they do it will be wall-to-wall coverage for weeks
[21:30:49] <gwozniak> The Surface Book that I used for a while and that my wife uses now is a terrible experience in touchscreen mode, aside from the pen.  It's pretty good.

[21:31:55] <manicennui> gwozniak: I think that's what makes the touchpad so good.
[21:32:10] <manicennui> At least part of it.
[21:32:14] <gwozniak> Apple's trackpad is easily the best out there
[21:32:24] <gwozniak> It's not even a contest, really.
[21:32:32] <manicennui> Yeah.
[21:32:52] <gwozniak> And just having a trackpad doesn't mean it's actually useful
[21:33:17] <gwozniak> The one on my ThinkPad is okay, but it's way less functional
[21:33:27] <manicennui> I didn't think about the fact that when people start freezing to death in TX, they can just go to the crypto mining warehouses for warmth.
[21:33:33] <gwozniak> Mostly because the OS has no way to make it useful
[21:35:36] <gwozniak> That trackball on the MNT Reform laptop looks hideous, not just in terms of esthetics, but ergonomics
[21:36:11] <gwozniak> Maybe it's okay, but trackpads are pretty nice.  I do like them.
[21:36:15] <manicennui> Laptops like the Reform seem like a nightmare to me.
[21:36:22] <manicennui> Linux is already pretty bad on good laptops.
[21:36:47] <manicennui> Macs made me lazy.
[21:36:53] <manicennui> I don't want to tinker with computers all day.
[21:37:19] <manicennui> There are enough interesting problems to solve without adding basic usage problems.
[21:37:35] <gwozniak> The Reform is something I would happily tinker with, but would not rely on
[21:37:59] <gwozniak> Way too expensive to get for just tinkering

[21:55:07] <prussian> man... I hate xml
[21:55:18] <manicennui> I bought a new water bottle and I've been drinking at least one full bottle per day.
[21:55:27] <prussian> how the fuck does leading/trailing whitespace in xml work and why does every library do it differently?
[21:55:46] <manicennui> Whitespace between what?
[21:55:55] <prussian>  <el>                leading space\n\n<\el> = text node is ???
[21:56:00] <manicennui> Ah.
[21:56:10] <prussian> where spacing is significant ofc.
[21:56:10] <manicennui> I honestly don't know.
[21:56:12] <prussian> same
[21:56:29] <manicennui> I would hope that it should be part of the text.
[21:57:29] <manicennui> Otherwise how would you represent multiple leading spaces if you actually wanted them?
[21:57:40] <prussian> it is with quick_xml... but I don't even know what the real hard and fast rules are.
[21:58:15] <prussian> I should just dump unindented crap
[22:00:57] <prussian> fuck it. I understand the lib i'm using now looking at the code, I'm just going to assume all space between <some_el> is signnificant.
[22:01:15] <gwozniak> If there is space in a text node, it should be part of the node.  But hey, who knows how it's implemented
[22:01:27] <prussian> that's always my fear

[22:03:46] <epilys> the typography reflects it
[22:04:16] <gwozniak> They seem to think it's compiler agnostic
[22:04:28] <gwozniak> But it relies on compiler specific pragmas
[22:05:15] <gwozniak> ``The memory mapping files include the compiler and linker specific keywords for memory allocation into header and source files. These keywords control the assignment of variables and functions to specific sections. Thereby implementations are independent from compiler and microcontroller specific properties.''
[22:05:47] <gwozniak> Basically, it has to go like this
[22:05:54] <gwozniak> #pragma section whatever
[22:05:56] <gwozniak> int foo;
[22:06:05] <gwozniak> #pragma section newsection
[22:06:12] <gwozniak> int something;
[22:06:36] * manicennui wonders what HN will think about this custom home
[22:06:39] <gwozniak> So foo ends up in section "whatever" and something ends up in "newsection"
[22:06:41] <gwozniak> Insanity

[23:21:46] <companion_cube> like, the more you consume, the more the price increases
[23:21:52] <companion_cube> fuck these wasters
[23:21:57] <manicennui> Ah, at least one thread argues about whether the style is modern vs postmodern vs minimalist or nordic.
[23:22:13] <manicennui> companion_cube: That should be applied to a lot of things.
[23:22:19] <manicennui> Like property taxes.
[23:22:28] <companion_cube> yep…
[23:23:12] <manicennui> We could solve the affordable housing problem in a generation if we made it unprofitable to "invest" in homes and be a landlord.
[23:23:38] <gerikson> "nordic"
[23:23:57] <manicennui> gerikson: Yes, your culture is nothing more than an aesthetic!
[23:23:58] <companion_cube> oh, you mean, the more homes, the more taxes per home? fuck yeah
[23:24:13] <manicennui> companion_cube: All non-primary residences should be taxed out the ass.
[23:24:30] <Geekingfrog> ^
[23:24:33] <companion_cube> yeah but now you're a filthy communist
[23:24:38] <manicennui> Also fine with progressive brackets for primary residences.
[23:24:58] <manicennui> As long as they take into account the fact that average home prices in many areas are ridiculous.
[23:25:11] <Geekingfrog> You shouldn't be able to make much money from rent. If the property gains value and you make money off the sale, that's fine, but not exploiting the need for shelter
[23:25:25] <manicennui> Geekingfrog: You shouldn't be able to make any money off people's survival.
[23:25:30] <companion_cube> "bu-bu-but someone needs to own the houses"
[23:25:47] <manicennui> companion_cube: Yeah, when the market collapses, the renters can buy them.
[23:27:24] <companion_cube> if only…
