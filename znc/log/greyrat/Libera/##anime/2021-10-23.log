[04:20:21] <MootPoot> Lmao 
[04:20:52] <MootPoot> Bco1981: maybe it's because I was using all of my own hardware in my pc
[04:21:11] <MootPoot> And you only get premade driver updates from Microsoft if you have a OEM device registered with them 
[04:21:56] <Bco1981> yeah that might have something to do with it. i didn't see all these driver updates for my core2quad
[04:22:15] <Bco1981> whic is kinda weird concidering hole old it is

[04:24:33] <MootPoot> On one hand if they didn't force updates all the normies would ignore every security update then bitch as microsft
[04:24:48] <Bco1981> very true
[04:25:05] <MootPoot> The wannacry and pipeline hack exploits were already patched ..but people going "ew updates" resulted in that outcome 
[04:25:22] <MootPoot> Oh wow keyboard works again 
[04:26:27] <MootPoot> Mouse still no wurk
[04:27:08] <MootPoot> Bco1981: the worst thing is that 95% of people who bitch about control and annoying updates for Windows  don't know shit about their computer at the core 
[04:27:10] <Bco1981> probably waiting for a update
[04:27:19] <emmeka> I keep a shortcut to an on screen keyboard on my desktop just because I'm paranoid that my keyboard will fail at some crucial moment, such as when somebody is greviously wrong on IRC and in need of learnin'
[04:27:41] <MootPoot> All the Linux people on discord meming about Linux having more security and control barely know the system deep down 
[04:27:46] <MootPoot> It's like arch users 
[04:27:52] <MootPoot> I know I don't know shit 
[04:27:53] <Bco1981> MootPoot: yeah... but i like my own control over my OS...
[04:27:57] <MootPoot> Bco1981: lol
[04:28:00] <MootPoot> That exact line 
[04:28:06] <ButterNoodle> u shut ur whore mouth
[04:28:28] <ButterNoodle> :)
[04:28:34] <emmeka> MootPoot the good thing about open source is I don't necessarily have to know everything deep down, some other nerds will be paying attention
[04:28:36] <MootPoot> "I like my control" proceeds to put stickers on their PC 
[04:28:56] <Bco1981> no!... freaking stickers!
[04:29:14] <MootPoot> emmeka: that's true of any software any organization makes and actively maintains 
[04:29:19] * Bco1981 even removes the ones from the manufacture
[04:29:20] <emmeka> no, it isn't.
[04:29:37] <ButterNoodle> I remember popping in the #windows channel.. asked why the fuck my force reboot settings werent working and some beta cuck told me to take my updates.. 
[04:29:44] <MootPoot> I just put a shortcut to an on screen key keyboard
[04:29:56] <Bco1981> ButterNoodle: lol
[04:30:06] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: problem is butter you're in the 5% who knows what they're doing 
[04:30:12] <MootPoot> Not the pile of arch users 
[04:30:13] <MootPoot> Lol
[04:30:24] <MootPoot> emmeka: how so?
[04:30:30] <ButterNoodle> called em a beta cuck with no understanding of the os.. and to let the smart people have a conversation
[04:31:00] <MootPoot> The software engineers at MS or apple or whatever don't have nerds paying attention so that their average user dosent have to know?
[04:31:03] <ButterNoodle> they dumped a line of insults and left
[04:31:16] <ButterNoodle> *figured it out on my own
[04:31:17] <Bco1981> with the core2quad system, i only had to reboot because the audio driver told me to. otherwise i had installed nvidia, dx9.0c sdk, all the visual c++ redistributeables. and other stuff.
[04:31:19] <MootPoot> It's literally their entire model - sell to people who don't know shit or can't do it myself 
[04:31:23] <Bco1981> windows 11^
[04:31:36] <emmeka> MootPoot they have nerds paying attention to what Microsoft wants them to do.
[04:31:47] <emmeka> this is not necessarily in your best interest, or mindful of your privacy
[04:31:53] <MootPoot> True
[04:32:00] <ButterNoodle> just like the #pfsense community
[04:32:06] <MootPoot> But how is open source any different? 
[04:32:11] <MootPoot> Look at Ubuntu 
[04:32:13] <ButterNoodle> u know
[04:32:29] <MootPoot> Or what's it called ... the RISC V. Team 
[04:32:31] * Bco1981 still haven√∏t powered on the new pfsense firwwall
[04:32:35] <Bco1981> firewall*
[04:32:45] <MootPoot> Open source does not automatically mean they are free from corporate influence
[04:32:46] <ButterNoodle> irc is a place where people who dont know shit about SOMETHING join #SOMETHING and try to look cool
[04:32:59] * MootPoot has been found out
[04:33:03] <MootPoot> I'm a fake anime 
[04:33:03] <Bco1981> lol

[04:34:05] <snake> !a mother goddess dormitory
[04:34:06] <ImoutoBot> snake: I don't recognize that anime.
[04:34:08] <emmeka> MootPoot being free from corporate influence isn't the issue. With open source software you can be relatively sure that the software isn't malicious or a threat to your privacy because if it was some nerd would see it and scream
[04:34:09] <snake> !a mother of the goddess dormitory
[04:34:09] <ImoutoBot> snake: I don't recognize that anime.
[04:34:18] <Bco1981> oh... the snake is awake

[04:35:28] <Bco1981> ohayo amigojapan 
[04:35:32] <snake> ohayou
[04:35:44] <amigojapan> Ohayou Bco1981 
[04:35:55] <MootPoot> I agree that it's *probably* more likely that open source does not have corporate interest in mind, but not to enough of a degree that it matters too much 
[04:35:56] <amigojapan> Ohayou snake 
[04:36:06] <emmeka> MootPoot why are you just ignoring what I'm saying
[04:36:27] <MootPoot> emmeka: the RISC V team got lubed up with money and ended up basically violating the principles of open source 
[04:36:45] <MootPoot> Open source, now you need to be a partner to get documents 
[04:36:51] <emmeka> it sounds like somebody noticed this and screamed, since you know about it.
[04:37:03] <MootPoot> Yes, but it wasn't the person in the group 
[04:37:11] <MootPoot> To my understanding
[04:37:12] <emmeka> so
[04:37:29] <MootPoot> So if it's external nerds either way
[04:37:41] <emmeka> closed source = no external nerds
[04:37:50] <emmeka> how is this hard to understand
[04:38:51] <emmeka> whether it has a corporate interest in mind isn't the issue, which I just said, 3 minutes ago. The issue is whether or not any schmuck can basically audit the entire thing, if they want, which basically prevents the software from doing anything malicious or that would constitute a breach of privacy
[04:39:19] <MootPoot> Ok

[04:43:36] <snake> gotta dig into the code one day
[04:44:01] <snake> its actually only like 500 lines

[05:03:42] <MootPoot> Project 1/3 complete 
[05:03:47] <amigojapan> Altho the max ram was only 8gb
[05:04:04] <MootPoot> amigojapan: consumerist 
[05:04:22] <amigojapan> MootPoot: it was cheap
[05:04:40] <MootPoot> Words like cheap only exist due to consumerism 
[05:04:50] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I needed it
[05:05:03] <ButterNoodle> nice amigojapan 
[05:05:06] <MootPoot> COONSUMERISM
[05:05:09] <ButterNoodle> bet its fast
[05:05:13] <MootPoot> Fat
[05:05:17] <ButterNoodle> coomsumerism
[05:05:36] <amigojapan> MootPoot: well I can't even survive in a consumerist world Withought buying food
[05:05:36] <ButterNoodle> I need to buy some more ram for my radio laptop
[05:05:59] <MootPoot> amigojapan: better to die then be coomsumerist
[05:06:08] <MootPoot> Or become a homesteader 
[05:06:15] <amigojapan> MootPoot: lol
[05:06:32] <snake> MootPoot, why on earth would you want to convert others to windows
[05:06:34] <MootPoot> I got a 128gb usb today 
[05:06:39] <snake> there's nothing in it for you or the community
[05:06:41] <snake> lol
[05:06:52] <ButterNoodle> buce
[05:06:55] <ButterNoodle> nice*
[05:07:03] <ButterNoodle> my heatsink came
[05:07:10] <MootPoot> snake: because other people sometimes may be better suited with windows then other operating system, although that's not always the case 
[05:07:18] <ButterNoodle> now I can finish up that p100 :)
[05:07:25] <snake> that's for them to decide
[05:07:26] <MootPoot> The answer to everything is not Linux 
[05:07:40] <MootPoot> snake: sure but they asked for help from me so...
[05:08:18] <amigojapan> MootPoot: nobody here has asked you for help
[05:08:35] <MootPoot> I'm not talking about you amigojapan or anyone here 
[05:08:43] <amigojapan> Ok
[05:08:49] <MootPoot> I'm talking about the other people I converted 
[05:09:41] <MootPoot> A mac owner wants to game, I tell them windows. A web dev wants a high end fancy laptop , I tell them mac. A person needs a htpc , I tell them Linux/kodi
[05:09:43] <snake> i wrote an essay comparing windows and linux, argued that schools and governments should switch to linux
[05:09:54] <MootPoot> Pick the tool for the job 
[05:09:56] <amigojapan> MootPoot: win 11 is imitating Mac now
[05:10:21] <MootPoot> amigojapan: everything is imitating everything else at this point
[05:10:31] <MootPoot> It's just a Ui level similarity
[05:10:37] <MootPoot> But it's good that they are 
[05:10:51] <MootPoot> Apple is usually better at UI then Microsoft
[05:11:05] <amigojapan> That's true
[05:11:13] <MootPoot> I don't care who copies who 
[05:11:25] <snake> hope i get a good grade on that one
[05:11:27] <MootPoot> I want the best product for what I do
[05:11:32] <snake> MootPoot, idk i didnt like apple ui
[05:11:39] <snake> everything had to be different for no good reason
[05:11:47] <MootPoot> Different? 
[05:11:48] <snake> like there is no way to refresh the calendar or notes
[05:12:00] <MootPoot> Apple keeps it all tightly controlled
[05:12:07] <MootPoot> Oh you mean different from other OS?
[05:12:12] <MootPoot> Yeah
[05:12:35] <MootPoot> But thing is we would be stuck at like windows XP level UI without apple 
[05:12:45] <snake> did you see the new MBP has a notch at the top
[05:12:48] <snake> just like iphone x
[05:12:51] <snake> or whatever
[05:12:56] <MootPoot> Yeah, I don't really care about the notch
[05:13:06] <snake> its an abomination
[05:13:15] <MootPoot> It gives me more screen space 
[05:13:15] <snake> but apple fans will buy anything that's shiny and made by apple
[05:13:26] <amigojapan> MootPoot: one of the reasons why we have windows instead of gem desktop is that Apple sued gem and won in the past
[05:13:39] <MootPoot> Gem?
[05:14:07] <mixfix41> windows is the first computer company to box a software
[05:14:09] <amigojapan> MootPoot: Windows alternative for DOS that looked like Mac
[05:14:16] <mixfix41> software-only computer product
[05:14:57] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: I'm good to play 
[05:14:59] <mixfix41> aaron swartz had written a unfinish book that they release since he pass away and he goes over the history i read it 
[05:15:00] <snake> mixfix41, you could buy games and stuff for like apple II e and old basic pcs too
[05:15:07] <snake> mixfix41, they came on floppy fisks
[05:15:17] <MootPoot> Gonna get a drink and put a print job on the 3d printer

[05:22:50] <snake> and its FOSS

[05:23:02] <amigojapan> snake: react?
[05:23:15] <snake> amigojapan, yes

[07:43:42] <ImoutoBot> jessedesu_onaph: A live action role-playing game is a form of role-playing game where the participants physically portray their characters. The players pursue goals within a fictional setting represented by real world environments while interacting with each other in character.

[07:45:09] <ArtilleryChef> also, ButterNoodle in an aqueous solution would ensure that the solution doesn't change its PH - he's a BufferedNoodle
[07:45:19] <wedr> The lyrics would go like:   ÊÑõ„Åô„Å©„Åì„Å®„ÇÇ„Å®„Çå„Åü„Å°„Åü„ÄÄ„ÄÄor something like that
[07:45:27] <ArtilleryChef> A buffer is a solution containing either a weak acid and its salt or a weak base and its salt, which is resistant to changes in pH. In other words, a buffer is an aqueous solution of either a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid. A buffer may also be called a pH buffer, hydrogen ion buffer, or buffer solution.
[07:45:27] <ArtilleryChef> Buffers are used to maintain a stable pH in a solution, as they can neutralize small quantities of additional acid of base. For a given buffer solution, there is a working pH range and a set amount of acid or base that can be neutralized before the pH will change. The amount of acid or base that can be added to a buffer before changing its pH is called its buffer capacity. 
[07:45:47] <ArtilleryChef> if ButterNoodle went into business as a domestic assistant, he'd be ButlerNoodle
[07:46:23] <wedr> Can I add? If ButterNoodle went into the ramen restaurant as a sous chef, he might be called ButterRamen instead.
[07:46:40] <ArtilleryChef> If ButterNoodle suddenly got into anal sex, he'd be BuggerNoodle

[09:58:09] <omero> its stendhal
[09:58:27] <saganman> actually I haven't read Proust either, I read a book in praise of that book

[09:58:36] <omero> which isnt his real name but un nome de plume

[10:07:29] <omero> did you read that in ... english?
[10:07:43] <omero> or in french
[10:08:26] <omero> challenging. sorry couldnt think of a better word
[10:08:49] <MootPoot> omero: very kintama
[10:11:34] <saganman> English
[10:11:48] <saganman> omero: the only french I know is from ofah
[10:11:53] <omero> MootPoot: lol online translating engines are ... crap
[10:12:36] <saganman> and Delboy uses them all in wrong context from what I heard
[10:13:29] <omero> no idea who delboy is 
[10:13:35] <omero> or what
[10:14:15] <saganman> Delboy is a character from british sitcom only fools and horses
[10:14:24] <omero> actually italian is closer to french than spanish
[10:15:38] <omero> by closer I mean similar
[10:15:52] <omero> in grammar structure
[10:15:57] <saganman> of course 
[10:16:15] <Urchin[emacs]> saganman: Delboy uses French in very wrong context
[10:16:35] <saganman> Mange tout Urchin[emacs] 
[10:16:45] <saganman> :p
[10:17:43] <Urchin[emacs]> the one I remember is him thinking "m√©nage √† trois" means "such is life"
[10:18:00] <omero> bhuahuahuaha 
[10:18:09] <omero> ok I get the idea now :P
[10:18:30] <saganman> he says mange tout for idiot/stupid
[10:19:11] <omero> well... actually... its a bit far fetched but it isnt totally off
[10:20:10] <omero> its an allegory, a metaphore... a figure of speach... very subtle
[10:21:30] <saganman> I see
[10:22:15] <Urchin[emacs]> only fools and horses was extremely popular in my country, but we didn't make our own version, that was just real life for us
[10:22:55] <omero> if you think it like "a mange tout" is someone that will just devour any kind of crap without flinching
[10:23:39] <saganman> I see
[10:23:43] <omero> its the equivalent of saying he's gullible, he will believe anything told to him...

[10:24:16] <saganman> that sounds interesting Cryowolf 
[10:26:16] <omero> what kind of stories, Cryowolf ?
[10:26:38] <Cryowolf> omero, dark fantasy meets folk loreish
[10:27:06] <Cryowolf> with a hint of Cthulu in there
[10:27:07] <omero> dark fantasies eh? 
[10:27:21] <omero> ah... the good kind then :P
[10:27:32] <omero> tentacle hentai ...
[10:27:44] * omero is just kidding
[10:28:12] <Cryowolf> not going down hentai, it's gonna be closer to berserk and hellsing alucard- any and all tentacles

[10:29:03] <Cryowolf> good luck saganman
[10:29:07] <saganman> Cryowolf: how much does the artist charge?
[10:29:31] <Cryowolf> nothing
[10:29:40] <saganman> woah!
[10:29:41] <Cryowolf> we're going to colaborate
[10:29:50] <Cryowolf> we're both in it
[10:29:52] <omero> Im intrigued... how does it work out... you write the story and he illustrates it?
[10:30:09] <Cryowolf> more complex
[10:30:31] <Cryowolf> Overall he needs to be happy with the story direction etc
[10:31:04] <Cryowolf> and overall I need to be happy with the art direction so it fits into the story
[10:31:48] <Cryowolf> when creating a new character that'll be around more then just a page, We'll both be involved.
[10:32:15] <Cryowolf> if its a temporaryc haracter or temp-villlain, then Ican give a bland desccription
[10:32:21] <saganman> that's exciting Cryowolf 
[10:32:39] <saganman> how did you find this person anyways?
[10:32:41] <Cryowolf> but if its like the protagonist, then we both need to be in it 100%
[10:32:59] <Cryowolf> like I describe, he draws, he modified, he shows
[10:33:00] <Cryowolf> etc
[10:33:09] <omero> and moreover, how the collaboration is carried over...
[10:33:24] <Cryowolf> omero, what do you mean?
[10:33:27] <omero> I mean... not over IRC, supposedly
[10:33:44] <omero> long distance calls?
[10:33:54] <Cryowolf> and now Im having questions from multiple angles and Im not well enough brainwise for that
[10:33:56] <saganman> omero: wanna read my story?
[10:34:38] <Cryowolf> omero, we'll communicate however we feel works
[10:35:19] <omero> that why I was asking... what does actually work in such a case?
[10:35:22] <Cryowolf> saganman, we're kind of acquainted and he likes my creativity, imagination and writing stuff and I like his   style
[10:35:25] <saganman> if possible meet in person
[10:36:01] <Cryowolf> omero, well I 'll do the editing of stiching the final product together and it is a LN
[10:36:12] <omero> saganman: depends on which language your story is written :)
[10:36:36] <Cryowolf> we both speak English just fine
[10:36:43] <saganman> omero: English obviously. English is almost like my native language
[10:37:11] <Cryowolf> neither of us are native English, I think he's Mexican, while I'm Swedish
[10:37:14] <Berlin36> yo
[10:37:50] <omero> I worked mostly in technical projects, never artistic ones
[10:38:01] <omero> this is the reason I am inquisitive
[10:38:30] <omero> because its something I cannot really 'think' how the process works in that field
[10:38:49] * omero waves at Berlin36 
[10:39:09] <Cryowolf> thats why Im confused...he's the only one who draws and Im the only one who writes. Outside of our brainstorm sessions, we'll work "alone"
[10:39:10] * Berlin36 waves back
[10:40:13] <omero> I would be very much confused too, Cryowolf ... I am positive that it can be done of course... but have no first hand experience in this sense
[10:40:28] <Cryowolf> hoiiww ould you be confused=
[10:40:42] <Cryowolf> what do you except from this?
[10:40:47] <Cryowolf> Idont get it
[10:41:07] <omero> do you have deadlines?
[10:41:18] <omero> or its just a spare-time project?
[10:41:59] <Cryowolf> right now we dont have deadlines cause I 've got cancer
[10:41:59] <omero> its an important aspect to consider
[10:42:06] <omero> oh
[10:42:44] <Cryowolf> hard to set deadlines nd completely  stick to them then
[10:43:14] <Cryowolf> we'll probably start seriously early next year and just brainstorm until then
[10:43:45] <saganman> characters and plotlines first!
[10:44:01] <Cryowolf> not necesserily
[10:46:20] <Cryowolf> you can create the map and the destination but who takes who where why are questions t can chanfgeand aware that would be kindo fideal for
[10:46:54] <Cryowolf> questions that can change and I'm aware that would be kind of ideal for VNs*
[10:47:24] <Cryowolf> but since I'm probably making a LN, much easier for a first try I think  :)
[10:50:31] <Cryowolf> we're also intending to make several short stories that combine into a single end that opens up the possibility of another plot, or several in fact. But only if we can make them. I.E if we have the finance etc

[15:03:56] <Cryowolf> scroll up and see what Im replying to?
[15:04:35] <KatrinValerie> And here in Germany accountancy is something you do not have to go to uni for
[15:04:54] <tafami> it is just that I am unsure of the college course I took. I am fairly good at math and had an interest in computer science, but colleges and universities near me do not have a good track record for ComSci. I took Accountancy since one university near me has a great track record. I had always been a STEM minded guy(??if such term exist??))
[15:05:04] <KatrinValerie> Though you can study economy related subjects and get accountancy on the way
[15:05:24] <DunceCotus> Cryowolf: oh right
[15:05:32] <tafami> KatrinValerie: just for curiosity, how does one become an account in Germany?
[15:05:51] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: well what is the worst thing of a year definitely depends much on the person suffering
[15:06:23] <Cryowolf> thats the joke
[15:06:42] <KatrinValerie> tafami: There are many different ways, school based education, college and university eduction and also dual education which means on the job training plus some sort of school
[15:06:58] <Cryowolf> cant believe I had to find non-anime people to understand one of my fucked up jokes
[15:07:00] <KatrinValerie> Or you just apply for an accountant job
[15:07:06] <tafami> KatrinValerie: I am from a third world country, though not poor we are also not middle class. So to get a license to be a CPA (Certified Public accountant) one needs to have a degree on Accounting
[15:07:12] <KatrinValerie> A friend of mine who studied biology somehow ended up in accounting
[15:07:46] <KatrinValerie> tafami: it is definitely something that is going to be in demand for a long time
[15:08:02] <KatrinValerie> You should think more about whether you will like the work
[15:08:05] <tafami> KatrinValerie: They do not need to have a BS Accountancy degree? Are Licensure Exams a thing for accountants in germany?
[15:08:39] <darkwitch> non-anime people is a much larger group
[15:09:13] <amigojapan> darkwitch: also I don't think anime makes a difference for that joke
[15:09:18] <KatrinValerie> tafami: I do not know all the details, for the different paths there are different types of Exams, it's probably not easily comparable to any other countries system. 
[15:10:37] <tafami> KatrinValerie: I have no idea of how I will fare once I start working. It is just that I am fairly sure that accountants have decent salaries. It will be such that "I will be an accountant for work and money, and I will suffer for the rest of my work-life for it, but at least I have money to pay the bills and buy some good shit and satisfy my weebshit pleasure"

[16:24:28] <DunceCotus> something about the unrealistic hyper-cutesified sugary sweetness
[16:24:50] <Matt|home> it's cheap, 10 or 20 bucks

[16:25:13] <Matt|home> at least i got the film
[16:25:22] <Sxem> i do 1.5x for the worst anime
[16:25:31] <tafami> DunceCotus: maybe thats a minor reason I appreciate moe
[16:25:43] <isekaijin> Matt|home: Did you buy the model rocket fully built, or did you have to build it yourself?
[16:25:44] <Sxem> slower for better
[16:25:47] <DunceCotus> failing to appreciate moe is a result of a highly developed neocortez

[16:27:50] <saganman> nothing new

[17:01:47] <amigojapan> !a blue period

[17:02:24] <amigojapan> Oh good, it is not about woman's periods
[17:03:54] <darkwitch> it has the same title in japanese, just damaged a bit
[17:05:21] <amigojapan> darkwitch: maybe something like political compass with girlyness on one side and manliness on the other and up is moral scale with wholesome at top and ero at bottom
[17:06:27] <amigojapan> darkwitch: maybe it can be generated by answering questions like political compass
[17:07:05] <darkwitch> if those are the things you care about, then it will fit into such a system
[17:07:24] <darkwitch> I don't think that's how the industry or even individual authors classify things
[17:08:03] <darkwitch> there is no prefect solution
[17:08:13] <amigojapan> darkwitch: the industry does it by what the target audience of the source material was
[17:09:02] <darkwitch> target audience can be grouped in different ways
[17:09:30] <amigojapan> Like what
[17:10:19] <darkwitch> they may want as many people as possible to watch it

[17:34:32] <emmeka> if you do this, I will be obligated to respond with "excuse me, did you just assume that anime's gender"

[17:40:34] <amigojapan> Right emmeka I made a mistake
[17:41:14] <darkwitch> more mistakes will be made once this system is in place
[17:41:39] <amigojapan> emmeka: I think most people are unhappy with the current two ways of rating an anime type
[17:42:47] <amigojapan> emmeka: I will make a web page to do it like political compass, based on questions
[17:43:08] <amigojapan> darkwitch: that is always the case with software
[17:44:27] <emmeka> I think the system is bound to fail given the amount of things that are simultaneously very wholesome and very perverted (think Dragon Maid), simultaneously girly and boyish (Horimiya is a seinen series), and how many things are both uplifting and tragic.
[17:44:35] <emmeka> also, your system has no way to reflect comedy
[17:44:46] <darkwitch> it will be like making a cheese classification system from white to blue and then discovering that other colors also exist
[17:45:08] <amigojapan> emmeka: then it will just be in the center

[17:59:38] <cthulchu> why even tho? They are pretty cool

[18:01:47] <wedr> amigojapan, I would say it's garbage, because it mostly hits on slice-of-life experiences, and not something that explores more in-depth in the world.
[18:02:01] <amigojapan> cthulchu: it follows some really silly tropes, like being killed by a truck and becoming over powered in the next world
[18:02:40] <wedr> ^^ adding on to that, it's to a point where a parody manga series revolves around the truck driver itself
[18:03:45] <amigojapan> Lol
[18:06:00] <amigojapan> wedr: there are some good ones, parodies can be good like konosuba and re zero did not follow the tropes and was good
[18:06:24] <darkwitch> isekai is not about parallel dimensions at all. maybe the word was used that way in older works before they started mistreating it
[18:08:48] <emmeka> cthulchu isekai is like an entire trope/genre of trash anime at this point, that all follow more or less the same plot and setup
[18:08:58] <darkwitch> I mean in proper novels, not "light novels" written by horrible people who use titles that are way too long and descriptive

[18:15:04] <emmeka> that whole scene where they have to kill their first goblin is pretty messed up

[19:45:22] <Sadale> Now that a full-ledge SSD of the same capacity is even cheaper than Firecuda SSHD.
[19:45:26] <Bco1981> it's usually Barracuda...
[19:45:34] <Sadale> What's even the point of using Firecuda?
[19:45:46] * Sadale owns a Firecuda in shame xD
[19:45:59] <Sadale> Back then Firecuda were cheaper than SSD and offers nice capacity
[19:47:02] <Bco1981> PC gaming, high performance PC, creative pro applications, workstations.
[19:48:11] <Sadale> oh. The main feature of Firecuda is that it has SSD cache inside the HDD.
[19:49:34] <potatoxel[m]> <Sadale> "A web client in a dedicated..." <- id rather not use that either
[19:49:46] <potatoxel[m]> i want a free client
[19:49:56] <Sadale> You know what's the best solution?
[19:49:59] <Sadale> Don't use discord :P

[19:50:12] <potatoxel[m]> that is what i am doin
[19:50:17] <Bco1981> the discord client is free. and the browser for the webapp too.

[20:07:42] <cthulchu> I like it IRL too.
[20:07:53] <cthulchu> I like seeing effort paying off.
[20:09:05] <darkwitch> it's like a story written by an rpg gamer
[20:12:19] <cthulchu> indeed. and sometimes they are not even hiding the fact that this is an rpg
