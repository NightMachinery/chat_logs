[18:16:25] <T`aZ> imo, it has only gotten worse. a sound daemon is only the proof the backbone sux dicks
[18:17:30] <T`aZ> having audio pulse eating 10% cpu on an intel i7 11th gen, while no sound is being played, can only add a second proof of the disaster of the situation

[18:20:48] <Oxyd> Yup, definitely much worse than having no sound at all for days until you figure out how to configure ALSA.
[18:20:58] <Renderwww> akschually I didn't have that many issues with pulseaudio
[18:22:11] <TheFlash> Oxyd: I did use it 20 years ago. And yes, there was period when software was written to use OSS but the device was used by something else (pulseaudio)...
[18:22:27] <TheFlash> T`aZ: I've never experienced pulseaudio doing that.
[18:22:48] <Oxyd> Yeah, you had to install that multiplexer thingy or whatever to be able to play sound from multiple programs at once.
[18:23:05] <TheFlash> But I have never had 11th Gen i7:s. My HW is older :)
[18:24:30] <Oxyd> On my 4th gen Ryzen 9 it takes 1.3% whilst playing music from Spotify. Must be an Intel issue.
[18:25:29] <Renderwww> subtle way to flex your newest gen silicon muscle
[18:25:46] <Oxyd> Feel my cores, dude.
[18:26:05] <TheFlash> In OSS times I normally just had one program running that wanted to use sound. Was kinda lame, but back then there was not much that needed the sound. Even web was mostly just text and pictures.
[18:26:39] <Oxyd> IM notifications wouldn't work with music in the background.
[18:26:51] <Renderwww> it's called focus mode!
[18:27:01] <Oxyd> Not if you're a teenager!
[18:27:07] <Renderwww> don't let those useless notifications distract you from your homework!
[18:28:37] <TheFlash> I never used any IMs (except IRC, if you count that) since maybe 5 years ago.
[18:29:11] <Oxyd> You lived through your teens without sexting on ICQ/AIM/Skype?
[18:29:55] <TheFlash> Pretty much
[18:29:59] <Oxyd> Sad.
[18:30:23] <TheFlash> Some of those didn't even exist when I was a teenager.
[18:30:34] <Oxyd> You can catch up now. With sound finally working, you won't miss any juicy pictures!
[18:31:07] <TheFlash> There was also no Linux client for most of those :)
[18:31:29] <Oxyd> There definitely were clients for ICQ and Skype.
[18:32:11] <TheFlash> An official one?
[18:32:37] <Oxyd> Not sure. But they worked just fine. I definitely recall the Skype client using OSS and suffering from the exclusive sound access issue.
