[00:00:08] <da_wunder> yeah - that is money well spent - imho
[00:01:17] <Byteflux> I've gotten a lot of value out of IntelliJ, PHPStorm and DataGrip, those alone have been easily worth it.
[00:02:01] <Byteflux> Nice to know that Rider and GoLand are there too, because I've been itching to get into C# and Go.
[00:02:21] <da_wunder> rider is really nice ide
[00:03:24] <Byteflux> From what I gather, way better than dropping money on Visual Studio esp if you want something cross platform
[00:03:32] <relipse> why is this giving me a white screen of death: https://i.imgur.com/BLTmeUk.png
[00:04:36] <da_wunder> yep, and for visual studio you would anyways want to buy resharper from jetbrains...
[00:04:54] <da_wunder> with rider you have that all already :D

[00:10:10] <ramblebamble> Hi there,  never thought I would ask this type of question, I might end up developing s.th. on company time but my own agenda, employer will know about it, I have no problem with them being given ownership, what I am concerned with is the credit I can claim afterwards, e.g. how can I proof to a new employer that I actually did develop that software, safe for the letter of employment, I will be given
[00:10:12] <ramblebamble> at the end of employment?
[00:12:09] <da_wunder> so talk your current company to make eg. a blog post about your work - that will help you and you company - and you could "hide" your own agenda to that
[00:13:31] <da_wunder> and you could "sell" that as like "this would help us to recruit more people ot our company" and so on
[00:14:06] <da_wunder> just make sure that you read that article before it's released and you've approved that
[00:14:15] <da_wunder> been there done that
[00:16:08] <__adrian> "> I have no problem with them being given ownership" then it's no different than anything else you write for them - and proof would be no different. you just write it on your resume/cv
[00:16:44] <ramblebamble> da_wunder, problem with that is that my old employer had a blog-post of mine taken down once I left, so not as reliable as i would like it to be
[00:16:50] <Byteflux> That, but also if it's a product that hasn't been publicly disclosed, then refer to your current non-disclosure agreement.
[00:16:53] <da_wunder> but just make sure that you can refer those products on your CV
[00:17:05] <__adrian> you can't have it both ways. it's etiher yours or it's not.
[00:17:18] <Byteflux> Yep, if it's not yours, it's not yours.
[00:17:54] <Byteflux> You don't get to decide to take credit for someone else's intellectual property.
[00:17:57] <ramblebamble> It is not about ownership, but claiming credit for the idea but __adrian's point rings with me at the end it is not really different I guess
[00:19:00] <Byteflux> You created something on company time, meaning you were paid to perform that work. You aren't entitled to any credit.
[00:19:59] <ramblebamble> Then I guess I do it on my own time. Thanks for the insight.
[00:20:05] <da_wunder> but if you contract say that you can use those in your CV then you could say "I was working with product X ...."
[00:21:01] <da_wunder> and doing something on your owntime is also problematic - if you do some code - what license you're going to use?
[00:21:25] <da_wunder> just saying that companies doesn't use software that has license that restrict they too much
[00:21:48] <ramblebamble> GPL, It is not like I wanna grow rich of this, but my work being acknowledged if it pans out
[00:22:05] <__adrian> if this is somehting you want to be sure you can continue to work on after your current employer, then get them to os-license it. and publish it somewhere (like github)
[00:22:12] <ramblebamble> at the end it is about not being a big unkown when it comes to the work I can perform
[00:22:18] <Byteflux> "On your own time" doesn't always imply "yours" either.
[00:22:20] <__adrian> and sign your commits
[00:22:27] <Byteflux> Non-compete agreements are common
[00:22:45] <ramblebamble> I don't have one
[00:22:49] <__adrian> yes, but not worth agreeing  to.
[00:23:15] <Byteflux> I'm pretty sure I'm bound by some non-compete stuff :P
[00:23:35] <Byteflux> I'd have to double check, but not crazy or unusual.
[00:24:17] <da_wunder> and really if you're already  thinking like that - for me it looks like you're not working on "correct" company
[00:24:24] <__adrian> mmm
[00:25:12] <Byteflux> I like where I work, really good culture and work/life balance. I just had the last 8 days off for the holidays :D
[00:26:38] <Byteflux> It's a cloud hosting provider and I don't have any interesting for getting into the cloud hosting business so there's no conflicts any way
[00:26:49] <da_wunder> same here - last week was "work" but I just watched some plurasight videos to get my yearly study hours spent
[00:29:44] <da_wunder> and really I've been working with current company like 14.3 years - so that should tell something - I really like working here
[00:30:29] <Byteflux> Pretty insane considering the turnover rate in this industry
[00:30:41] <da_wunder> yep
[00:31:19] <da_wunder> I usually go to interviews like 1-4 per year, just to see what other have to offer
[00:31:25] <ramblebamble> no believe me I do work at a good company, it is just that I have been burned one too many times by the wrong companies
[00:33:31] <da_wunder> ramblebamble: so one way could be that you release your library as OS - and if/when your company start to use it - just refer that in your original repository - allthough that might need some specified license text to be 100% safe
[00:34:02] <da_wunder> or just ask your current company if that is ok
[00:34:26] <ramblebamble> k
[00:34:31] <da_wunder> be open - and not do anything behind the back - that will help you a lot

[11:00:09] <ugga-the-caveman> ahoi. I want to exec() a console command that ttakes a long time. It works in the end, but the whole server is unresponsive until its finished.   here is the code https://gist.github.com/Ugga-the-Caveman/a8a89dd5613673f520b0808908b2e845
[11:00:25] <ugga-the-caveman> is that normal behaviour or am i doing it wrong ?
[11:00:39] <ugga-the-caveman> i am on linux and the command is speedtest-cli

[11:01:15] <Snowman24> When y ou say "the whole server is unresponsive", can you elaborate, ugga-the-caveman?
[11:01:26] <Snowman24> The server stops responding to ping? You have an SSH session open and it does nothing?
[11:01:31] <ugga-the-caveman> i have 2 tabs open
[11:01:48] <ugga-the-caveman> 1 is the page mentioned above and some other
[11:01:52] <ugga-the-caveman> on the server
[11:02:11] <Snowman24> Can you try with one of the tabs being icognito and see if that changes the behaviour? (just one of them, not both)
[11:02:12] <ugga-the-caveman> when i start the command, both bages dont reload
[11:02:28] <ugga-the-caveman> until the speedtest page is finished and outputs

[11:02:54] <ugga-the-caveman> how do i do that, i am on firefox ?
[11:03:17] <Snowman24> On Firefox it would be a new private window
[11:03:58] <ugga-the-caveman> ah i did it
[11:04:10] <ugga-the-caveman> and yes, that worked fine
[11:04:22] <ugga-the-caveman> wtf ?!
[11:04:56] <Snowman24> Okay, good to know. At a guess it is related to how PHP handles sessions, sec, let me see if I can find some information that would be useful
[11:05:07] <ugga-the-caveman> oh nice yes
[11:05:26] <ugga-the-caveman> i am just a hobby "web-designer"
[11:05:39] <ugga-the-caveman> dont really know much about session
[11:05:48] <ugga-the-caveman> i mean i have some loginsystem but..
[11:09:00] <Snowman24> Um, I can't find any super great resources, but have a search for "PHP session locking"
[11:09:16] <Snowman24> Sorry, I'm sure there is a good resource out there, but I cna't see one :(
[11:09:19] <Snowman24> Someone else here migth know
[11:10:17] <ugga-the-caveman> ok i googled that too
[11:10:28] <ugga-the-caveman> i did fly over this https://ma.ttias.be/php-session-locking-prevent-sessions-blocking-in-requests/
[11:10:42] <ugga-the-caveman> i think i have an idea how this might happened
[11:13:08] <ugga-the-caveman> JEPP EASY
[11:13:15] <ugga-the-caveman> i fixed it !
[11:13:24] <ugga-the-caveman> thx for the right advice dude!
[11:13:54] <ugga-the-caveman>  the session is locked until the php script is completed
[11:14:05] <ugga-the-caveman> so the other page cannot reload
[11:14:17] <ugga-the-caveman> but  session_write_close() makes it that the session is free again
[11:14:28] <ugga-the-caveman> pretty eqasy solution

[14:37:04] <poncha> if i run date("Y-m-d", strtotime("2021-12-31 -1 month")), why does it return 2021-12-01 ?
[14:37:28] *** Joins: mIk3_08 (~Thunderbi@user/mik3-08/x-2852566)
[14:39:52] <poncha> what i suspect is that this actually goes on to replace the month part of the date and then does strtotime on the resulting value. (and because the previous month did not have 31 days, it gets corrected into next day)
[14:40:43] <poncha> if you try the same code with 2021-03-31 as initial date, the result will be 2021-03-03 , which makes my suspicion even stronger ;)

[15:10:31] <delboy1978uk> morning o/
[15:13:56] <AllenJB> poncha: I've never seen strtotime used with a specific and relative date format combined like that. I'm not sure it's supposed to work. I would personally recommend working with DateTime objects and performing 2 steps: 1) Create initial date value (using ::createFromFormat is origin format is known); 2) Modify using ->modify().
[15:20:57] <poncha> AllenJB: it works "in most cases", but the same happens when you pass the second param as base time strtotime("-1 month", strtotime("2021-12-31")); <- this still returns time which translates to Dec 1 rather than Nov 30 ;)
[15:22:31] <AllenJB> strtotime works based on a precise set of rules, and if you parse it something unexpected it can still parse it but not in the way you intended. In my opinion it's too volatile and should be avoided. If you believe you've found a bug / unexpected behavior, please file an issue at https://github.com/php/php-src
[15:24:02] <AllenJB> You might want to search https://bugs.php.net for existing issues (PHP is in the process of migrating issue tracking to GitHub)
[15:27:01] <poncha> strangely enough, DateTime returns same result
[15:27:03] <poncha> php -r '$dt = new DateTime("2021-12-31"); $dt->modify("-1 month"); var_dump($dt);'
[15:27:33] <poncha> "2021-12-01 00:00:00.000000"
[15:28:07] <delboy1978uk> is there a doctrine channel on here or is it still on freenode?
[15:28:15] <AllenJB> Have you checked what time / timezone PHP is using? (add 'e' to the date format specifier for date() or ->format())
[15:29:16] <poncha> server is tz=3
[15:29:33] <poncha> and this is the tz both strtotime and DateTime use
[15:29:56] <poncha> also, if i do "-1 month" from 2021-03-31 --> this results in more than a day difference
[15:31:06] <poncha> DateTime that i initialize with date part only sets timezone_type=3 and timezone=Asia/Jerusalem

[15:33:44] <poncha> with this original "2021-12-31T00:00:00Z" - still same result. but i'm running php v7.0.33 ... maybe thats the problem ;)
[15:34:11] <AllenJB> Oh, I know why. November only has 30 days, so what happens is: 2021-12-31 - 1 month = 2021-11-31 => rolls over to 2021-12-01. You want to check how many days the previous month has (or set the dom to 0 then set it back to what you want after doing math)
[15:34:53] <poncha> yes, i guessed that much
[15:34:58] <poncha> but this is wrong... ;)
[15:35:16] <AllenJB> Depends how you define "wrong" =P
[15:35:54] <poncha> well when you say "a month ago" you never expect to get 1st of same month ;)
[15:36:36] <poncha> what i did now (in cases where i only care about the month) is i "diff" it from Y-m-01 instead of Y-m-d ;)

[19:27:49] <regedit> hello, can someone explain some "internals" about how PHP works in comparison to for example Node.js;
[19:28:30] <Naktibalda> start by asking specific question
[19:28:40] <regedit> (yep sorry here comes: )
[19:30:11] <regedit> when i deploy a node.js application which serves its own web server, and then i can also start a websocket server connected to upgrade from the http webserver, however does that work with the event-driven way in javascript, separate processes? threads?
[19:30:23] <regedit> i ask because i'm trying to get as close as possible to that in PHP
[19:30:34] <regedit> with Swoole and in my case trying to use Laravel Octane
[19:30:50] <__adrian> that's not a mainstream use case
[19:30:55] <Naktibalda> swoole is not a standard PHP
[19:31:04] <ramblebamble> regedit, and you will not have xdebug support
[19:31:09] <regedit> but regardless of particular libraries & frameworks, i'm trying to understand the underlying core PHP things about it;
[19:31:39] <regedit> does node.js have some better set up about processes/threads/concurrency/async which PHP inherently doesnt have?
[19:31:42] <__adrian> you're looking at learning a lot before that being practical to implement. and it would be (e.g.) swoole-specific
[19:31:45] <da_wunder> then I would forget swoole and async php - start with pure php first
[19:32:11] <ramblebamble> regedit, php applications are cached and executed every time a request comes in. that basically the principle reason why websockets and memory leaks in php are not really a thing
[19:32:24] <regedit> i see
[19:32:26] <__adrian> ^ php starts, runs, stops.
[19:32:40] <da_wunder> request <--> response - and that is all
[19:32:40] <__adrian> it does not normally keep running and serve multiple requests.
[19:33:22] <regedit> ok then i guess it's a swoole-specific thing i'm trying to figure out... i guess swoole tries to extend PHP to also have more than just request>response>done
[19:33:24] <Naktibalda> but Swoole, AMP, ReactPHP, etc.  keep running.
[19:34:32] <da_wunder> regedit: this might give you some insights - https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/symfonycon2019/building-really-fast-applications
[19:35:25] <regedit> ok thanks 👍 will be watching
[19:36:22] <regedit> if anyone here happens to know some swoole and/or laravel octane internals, or if you know of a better channel for those specific topics (or if i may PM you) i'd very much appreciate any leads
[19:37:26] <ramblebamble> regedit try #laravel and read code from the octane package

[19:38:29] <regedit> which one tho - swoole or openswoole? 😛
[19:38:57] <regedit> there's been a little drama there recently..
[19:39:11] <Naktibalda> try both
[19:39:23] <regedit> 👌
[19:45:03] <__adrian> apparently both projects are trying hard to smooth things over for the community and not compete with each other, so i will also not make recommendations / draw conclusions, but i do believe it's important to know why the split occured - regardless of which side you land on. https://issueexplorer.com/issue/swoole/swoole-src/4434
[19:45:29] <__adrian> tl;dr: both projects are currently very similar and both claim interoperability for the forseeable future.

[20:00:22] <ramblebamble> How sure are we that that is not intentional instead of a skiddy? after all swool originated in China. I am aware that a country's people are not their government, but the government will see it as a lever they will pull and this comment https://github.com/swoole/swoole-src/issues/4434#issuecomment-942898239 makes that thought all to real for my taste which is a shame, PHP would greatly benefit from
[20:00:24] <ramblebamble> an application server in certain use-cases
[20:00:52] <ramblebamble> I know I know politics -.-'
[20:01:03] <__adrian> i'm glad you know
[20:03:22] <__adrian> but national politics aside, this is not the place for the project politics either. i do believe people should be able to find out what happened, but please discuss elsewhere.
[20:03:23] <regedit> if anyone might find in their heart to hear my plight 😛 https://kopy.io/bUuJE (tl;dr skip to the bottom "how come in Node.js..." )
[20:04:08] <regedit> am also doing all above-mentioned homework (video, laravel/swoole dev communities etc.)
[20:04:16] <__adrian> is there a reason you're trying to "port" it rather than just use an existing swoole (or whatever) http/ws package?
[20:04:44] <regedit> well i guess i _was_ trying to use existing swoole + Laravel octane, i just might be doing it wrong...
[20:05:18] <regedit> i am able to serve the web app from command line with some octane command, that works to serve the HTTP
[20:05:31] <regedit> but then within the project code i try starting the WS server, and it blocks when i do
[20:05:35] <ramblebamble> regedit, are you sure WS are supported with octane, I ran into this issue using octane as well, but with roadrunner, and there the /ws-endpoint is not working when starting it with laravel-ocatne
[20:05:43] <Naktibalda> regedit: I think that you aren't supposed to start separate WebSocket server, even Node.JS reuses HTTP server
[20:06:20] <regedit> yes clearly i'm understanding things wrong...
[20:06:28] <regedit> Naktibalda: i see
[20:06:44] <__adrian> if you want to start with octane, i'd recommend asking these questions on a laravel-focused channel
[20:07:07] <regedit> Naktibalda: is there a way to achieve the same effect "reusing the HTTP server" in the PHP world (with mentioned libraries/frameworks) ?
[20:07:21] <Naktibalda> your question is library/framework specific
[20:07:37] <regedit> yep yep i realize...
[20:07:54] <ramblebamble> regedit, there is no HTTP-server with PHP, nginx/apache are providing that, running it on PHP with is possible but not the norm
[20:08:36] <regedit> ok thanks much for all the pointers 👍
[20:09:35] <regedit> i'm hoping "reusing the HTTP server" is one of the keywords that i need to achieve the similar-to-node.js goal i'm hoping for with PHP
[20:10:02] <__adrian> "async" will be a more useful term
[20:10:10] <regedit> ok 👌
[20:10:23] <__adrian> an http server is often the first thing such projects do
[20:10:44] *** Joins: magla (~gelignite@55d4e4de.access.ecotel.net)
[20:10:57] <da_wunder> or you could eg. use mercure for that part - https://mercure.rocks/
[20:11:05] <regedit> or maybe there's an alternative to set up websockets directly from nginx or something? which can work alongside the PHP app? or doesnt make sense... guess i'll ask around
[20:11:23] <regedit> #nginx or whatever
[20:11:45] <__adrian> if you simply want websockets, there's not a ton of reasons to use php - especially if it's for a production site/service.
[20:13:09] <ramblebamble> regedit, it also depends on your use-case, what design the finished application will have, available resources for deployment coding, etc. you can go from barebone to fairly complex really really fast
[20:14:51] <da_wunder> and if you're re-writing some existing node.js application to php, I would first ask "why you're doing it?", like "is there some problem that you cannot solve with node.js but you know that you can solve that with php", etc.
[20:15:18] <regedit> my tech stack choices include 1) being able to deploy to Heroku even free tier 2) PHP and laravel - simply just a language & framework of choice in this case 3) bonus - PHP apps seem to deploy blazingly fast on heroku, like orders of magnitude, like 5sec vs 3min sort of thing
[20:16:29] <regedit> da_wunder: to clarify - i myself wrote that original node.js project, and it was a prototype / proof of concept specifically trying to explore options and make decisions about languages / frameworks / deployment options
[20:16:35] <da_wunder> ok, so there is nothing wrong with that current nodejs application? if yes - who is going to pay that rewrite?
[20:16:42] <__adrian> what would limit you from deploying to heroku (aside from scale)?
[20:16:50] <ramblebamble> regedit, it depends on what you are doing, after all, you will also have to push allt he composer packages, or have them downloaded and installed locally, maintenance db migrations etc. fast is relative
[20:17:38] <__adrian> yeah, not sure what "deploy" means
[20:18:35] <regedit> i would be missing 1) possibly needing to increase threads/processes on heroku, not good enough for free tier 2) would be missing on a preference to use PHP and laravel 3) node.js apps take so much longer to build and deploy to heroku for some reason
[20:18:46] <__adrian> "deploying x vs. y takes 60× longer" would more likely be due to size/complexity than just which language it was written in
[20:19:26] <da_wunder> or just wrong configuration
[20:19:33] <__adrian> mm
[20:19:45] <regedit> i'm not adding anything too fundamentally massive on top of base-Strapi and base-Laravel. but Strapi takes 2-3 minutes to build & deploy. PHP laravel deploys within seconds. i dunno
[20:20:29] <__adrian> so... sample size of one?
[20:20:50] <regedit> not sure what you mean sample size, size of code base?
[20:21:09] <da_wunder> and are those doing the "same" things? if laravel is deployed that fast, I bet that deployment process doesn't do `composer install`
[20:21:24] <regedit> it totally does composer install
[20:21:31] <regedit> every single push+deploy
[20:21:40] <ramblebamble> your comparison lacks punch so to speak because you have only one sample of JS and PHP application with varying complexity and we do not know the techstackk you are utilizing.
[20:21:59] <regedit> and yet it is done and deployed almost within acceptable web page load time 😆
[20:22:26] <ramblebamble> e.g. npm vs yarn, how big is your composer.json where is the repository you are pulling form in either case, docker images, is everything in the repository or downloaded on the fly etc.
[20:23:03] <ramblebamble> also the deploymenttime shouldn't matter when it comes to page load time, the project ought to go online once it is ready, then you swap not before
[20:24:08] <regedit> ye true, i guess the deploy time thing is mostly helpful now for the prototyping & development phase, if i want to see results live on the production site - in one case i can see within seconds, in the other case it's several minutes ordeal
[20:24:29] <ramblebamble> ahmm you prototype on prod??
[20:24:47] <da_wunder> hmm, so you're making deploys to see your current dev progress?
[20:25:28] <regedit> ye fair point... it all goes back to dev/prod parity problems between development computers... windows doesnt support PHP with swoole and other such troubles
[20:25:34] <ramblebamble> regedit, *hust* kind, microk8s, virtual box, vagrant, docker *hust*
[20:25:41] <da_wunder> if yes, I would really recommend you to start development on your local machine - and make those deployments when you've something really ready
[20:26:20] <da_wunder> regedit: so eg. use virtualbox and install whatever linux you want to it and use that swoole there
[20:26:34] <regedit> and even then - node.js build time is still an ordeal even locally, it's not like suddenly it's faster than light because i'm developing locally not deploying to prod
[20:26:36] <da_wunder> and/or use docker for that

[20:32:05] <ramblebamble> da_wunder, so if I see this correctly mercure is gateway? WS to REST so PHP can make a rest-call POST update-whatever and mercure sends it out via WS?
[20:32:13] <regedit> on a similar/related note; can anyone explain about PHP websockets solutions vs. node.js, where in Node.js it seems more "natural" with the whole event-driven language style, but in PHP i've seen some solutions where you basically spin in a while loop reading the socket, which maybe means you need to consider running that in a separate process/thread or something... which wasn't a worry in node.js
[20:32:28] <da_wunder> ramblebamble: yep
[20:32:37] <ramblebamble> nice
[20:32:52] <regedit> so i'm wondering; is Node.js actually more "event driven" than PHP, or actually in Node.js they're internally also spinning a loop listening to a socket?

[20:33:40] <ramblebamble> da_wunder, a lot happend over the last few years in PHPSpace whenever I emerge from my hut after coding I find new things
[20:34:02] <da_wunder> ramblebamble: yep
[20:34:08] <regedit> __adrian: i guess they are the same? i might indeed be distinguishing them purely out of ignorance 😛
[20:35:21] <da_wunder> regedit: that mercure even has laravel broadcaster implementation - https://github.com/mvanduijker/laravel-mercure-broadcaster
[20:35:24] <__adrian> one is just an implementation of the other
[20:37:18] <regedit> but in Node.js i dont have to worry about prcoesses/threads, they seem to take care of concurrency of the application *while* websocket events might be coming in themselves as a language/runtime feature, whereas in PHP a solution needs to be devised about that?
[20:37:38] <regedit> da_wunder: interesting... will definitely check that
[20:37:40] <Naktibalda> regedit: node.js runs in a single process
[20:37:46] <__adrian> the event loop is what takes care of concurrency
[20:37:50] <ramblebamble> ask yourself what the programstructure looks like that is firing events, you will arrive at a loopstructure
[20:37:56] <__adrian> same as in php projects like swoole
[20:38:13] <regedit> i see...
[20:38:20] <Naktibalda> I haven't looked into it, but if you need more processes, there are tools called process managers
[20:38:47] <regedit> so swoole gives PHP the same "concurrency" as node.js has as a language feature?
[20:38:48] <ramblebamble> Naktibalda, you can also use pcntl and fork away
[20:39:19] <Naktibalda> node.js is not a programming language either
[20:39:57] <ramblebamble> regedit, not really, swoole is truely parallel, the V8engine NodeJS is powered by, or all other JS-implementations i know of, handle the events in one process,(node can spawn a fixed additional number of processes if configured though)
[20:40:33] <ramblebamble> That is way webworkers are such a big thing since their arrival but I am digressing
[20:40:43] <ramblebamble> *way*why
[20:41:02] <regedit> is there some way to have single-process fake-concurrency in PHP such as in node.js?
[20:41:11] *** Joins: Nekomander (~BadAdvice@user/badadvicecat)
[20:41:16] <regedit> with event loop kind of thing?
[20:41:27] <ramblebamble> yeah thaht is called the cli
[20:41:43] <ramblebamble> choose your framework code away
[20:42:38] <regedit> i'm basically circling back to my same quest; how to get the same effect i got in Node.js with single-process PHP (which i have lots of homework about i should be getting to)
[20:43:29] <Naktibalda> you already know that Swoole is one of the answers
[20:43:56] <regedit> yep apparently i found that even before i came here to #php
[20:46:34] * regedit downloads irc log
[20:46:51] <__adrian> regedit: we're confused. you seem to already know the answer but you keep asking the question.
[20:47:07] <regedit> lol i think i'm confused too 😆
[20:47:09] <__adrian> is there more to this that you're still not understanding?
[20:47:47] <regedit> it would have been awesome if i just tried starting the websocket server within the project code, and it would have "just worked" 😛 but instead it blocked the process listening for websocket traffic i guess...
[20:48:08] <regedit> proving i understand very little what i'm doing and how to do it right
[20:48:12] <Naktibalda> haven't you found a working example online?
[20:48:35] <Naktibalda> google: how to start websocket server in swoole
[20:48:38] <regedit> some examples do indeed step away from laravel octane, using for example laravel-s
[20:48:47] <regedit> Naktibalda: that google i did
[20:48:54] <regedit> and tried, and didnt get the effect i was hoping for..
[20:49:27] <regedit> maybe i was just doing it wrong, or maybe it's not possible and needs to be done in totally different way
[20:50:29] <__adrian> note also that if you don't know php, laravel (a framework) is not the way to learn it

[20:51:34] <regedit> "knowing" a language is usually impossible 😛 i've been working in php for years, but i guess this particular requirement and comparison with node.js needs some deeper understanding of the languages'/runtimes' internals to some extent
[20:51:42] <da_wunder> I'm still wondering _why_ you want to convert your _working_ node.js application to PHP, where you don't know how to complish the same...
[20:52:10] <regedit> because for example i know how to do just about everything else in PHP and not in node.js

[20:52:42] <regedit> PHP & laravel is a preferred language & framework. were using node.js to test the concept but am otherwsie lost there
[20:52:47] <ramblebamble> no offense but your statements are not consistent

[20:53:12] <__adrian> "regedit> "knowing" a language is usually impossible ..."  // my advice was practical, not philosophical
[20:54:08] <regedit> i've been coding in PHP for years and am familiar with several of its frameworks, am relatively quite new to node.js world
[20:54:17] <Naktibalda> regedit: I had a look at Laravel-S readme, and you don't need to start WebSocket server

[20:56:54] <regedit> how can i explain clearer about language & framework familiarity; i'm familiar with PHP & laravel - have worked with for years, not with node.js as much - only recently started dabbling

[20:59:57] <regedit> this was the first experience in my many years of working with PHP where i needed to understand how some deeper parts of the language/runtime works, and dabbling with another language for a proof of concept yielded pretty nice results - altho we still want to remain with more familiar lanugage & framework if possible
[21:01:17] <regedit> if you will trying out the proof-of-concept in node.js was a stepping stone in order to be able to ask / research / point to node.js and ask "how can i do THAT in php?"
