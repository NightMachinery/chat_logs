[01:39:45] <gilberth> lotuseater: I would appreciate when I would have two usable arms. But otherwise I am fine, thanks.
[01:46:09] <lotuseater> Is this from your vaccination?
[01:46:47] <lotuseater> I finally got my first appointment next friday.
[01:47:54] <lotuseater> or better "will have"
[01:49:06] <gilberth> lotsueater: Yes, I got my second shot of BioNTech yesterday.
[01:50:01] <lotuseater> and now they're talking about a third Biontech dosis cause of this delta variant
[01:50:08] <gilberth> s/su/us/ sorry
[01:50:08] <lotuseater> okay nice
[01:50:28] <lotuseater> ah my mind corrected it anyway :)
[01:50:36] <gilberth> Yes, in like six month after the second, I read.
[01:52:49] <gilberth> But we'll have a nice fourth wave, people don't learn.
[01:53:01] <lotuseater> I don't live there, but wonder what all the people in the US without insurance do. just getting the Johnson & Johnson vector stuff?
[01:53:11] <lotuseater> yes here too!
[01:54:24] <gilberth> I don't know. Have US citizen have to pay for their vaccination. Funny, that I was not charged, as I have a private health insurance.
[01:55:01] <lotuseater> phew, private sounds very expensive
[01:56:00] *** Quits: wallymathieu (~wallymath@81-234-151-21-no94.tbcn.telia.com) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[01:56:01] <gilberth> Not so much, as I don't work, I would also have to pay the half fee, that the employer pays otherwise for you.
[01:56:48] <gilberth> the other half, rather. So it's not more expensive than the total paid, would I be employed.
[01:56:57] <lotuseater> and now since yesterday even more restrictions in the region here in Germany are removed. the problem is not coming together in small groups with mindfulness, but the traveling and big events
[01:57:25] <lotuseater> oh ok
[01:57:29] <gilberth> Yes, and then we have the wonderful football.
[01:57:49] <gilberth> Your German, too? right?
[01:58:05] <lotuseater> ah you too?? :D i didn't remember
[01:58:27] <lotuseater> pff yes football ...
[01:59:05] <selwyn> gilberth: i thought you didn´t like football
[01:59:22] <lotuseater> i think "wonderful" was sarcastic ^^
[01:59:39] <gilberth> Ok. <GERMAN> In der GKV muesste ich auch den Arbeitgeberanteil zahlen, da ich keinen habe, bin dass dann ich, und in sofern ist die private nichte wirklich teurer. Auch wenn ich bei meiner Frau mitversichtert sein koenne ohne was zu zahlen --- will ich aber nicht </GERMAN>
[01:59:56] <lotuseater> yes i understood
[02:00:08] <gilberth> selwyn: Have I ever said, I would like it.
[02:00:35] <selwyn> well you wouldn´t like being here then
[02:00:39] <selwyn> big party atmosphere
[02:00:41] <gilberth> lotuseater: I just wanted to be sure, because I miss the right vocabulary. And two class medicine is a German thing.
[02:01:09] <selwyn> i am pretty sure vaccines are free in the us?
[02:01:19] <lotuseater> selwyn: in Germany much taxpayer's money is wasted on football for police and so on. even for the big players
[02:01:33] <gilberth> selwyn: Party is ok, but not over such an archaic pointless issue driven by patriotism.
[02:01:47] <lotuseater> gilberth: it's ridicolous, isn't it?
[02:02:18] <gilberth> The state should bill the football clubs for the police being there.
[02:03:49] <gilberth> And a sizeable amount of our house hold tax we pay for TV goes to footbool too.
[02:05:05] <lotuseater> uhhh nice. had to pay much back payment some days ago ... but I imagine it's mostly going for something like Kurzgesagt or Abenteuer Forschung
[02:05:19] <selwyn> well, football provides food and drink spending and charitable ventures to the rest of the economy
[02:05:25] <selwyn> it´s not a net drain on society
[02:05:54] <gilberth> Oh, and what get I in return?
[02:06:08] <lotuseater> it is a hollow meaningless construct in itself
[02:06:28] <gilberth> I am not in the foot and drink business, we do electrical installations, network installations, and solar panels.
[02:06:37] <lotuseater> hehe foot :D
[02:06:39] <gilberth> * food ;lol
[02:06:52] <selwyn> well, you get to live in an economy benefitting from these increased activities, even if you don´t partake in them yourself
[02:06:53] <gilberth> Funny typo indeed.
[02:06:56] <selwyn> more employment and so on
[02:06:59] <lotuseater> foot fetish business
[02:07:29] <selwyn> it is not fun to live in a society with more unemployment even if you are employed
[02:08:00] <lotuseater> yes selwyn, with broadcast taxes also, much jobs you don't "see" in the background
[02:08:48] <lotuseater> gilberth: maybe you know it, how efficient are solar panels right now?
[02:09:14] <gilberth> Still, I generally don't believe in the state distributing money to fund businesses.
[02:10:16] <gilberth> lotuseater: They pay off after like two to three years, so much I know. For actual efficiency, better ask my wife.
[02:10:22] <lotuseater> but some part of the money that remains at lotto goes to charity institutions
[02:10:48] <selwyn> iirc the experimental ones are pushing 50%
[02:10:50] <lotuseater> ah okay. I have in mind around 20-25%, with the normal silicium based
[02:10:54] <lotuseater> oh nice
[02:11:01] <gilberth> Yes, but the state does not force me to bet on the lottery.
[02:11:10] <selwyn> for solar cells i mean
[02:11:42] <lotuseater> no of course not. I heard some weaks ago someone was imprisoned for having not paid in a long time (three years or so)
[02:11:51] <lotuseater> yes selwyn :)
[02:12:09] <gilberth> Not paying what?
[02:12:51] <lotuseater> i once had thought if it could lead to better solar cells when using e.g. Graphene
[02:13:00] <lotuseater> gilberth: the radio taxes?
[02:13:22] <selwyn> i would guess it takes a while to make mature technologies with graphene
[02:13:23] <gilberth> That's harsh.
[02:13:47] <lotuseater> that's abuse of power
[02:13:51] <selwyn> there are exciting results with quantum dot solar cells, but again that is probably some way to commercialisation
[02:14:17] <lotuseater> yes quantum dots have also much potential (not just for use in TVs)
[02:14:25] <selwyn> indeed
[02:14:47] <selwyn> there are bbc licence officers who go to peoples houses and try to intimidate people into admitting guilt
[02:14:52] <selwyn> but their arguments are hilarious
[02:14:54] <gilberth> Well, I personally don't believe in so called renewable energy. I would go nuclear.
[02:15:12] <selwyn> they claim to have a special van that can detect what channel people are watching in their homes
[02:15:15] <lotuseater> Shooting at sparrows with cannons.
[02:15:44] <gilberth> selwyn: That is possible. Though always a lie.
[02:15:44] <selwyn> but they have never been able to reveal the details of it in court, or explain how such a thing is compatible with the laws of physics
[02:17:02] <lotuseater> or building a Dyson Swarm around the sun (just a ring)
[02:17:22] <gilberth> selwyn: Well, in an analog receiver the signal is mixed with the carrier to recover the signal. This carrier also radiates. So in theory you could detect a receiver. Thus Nazi Germany you better be careful when listening BBC.
[02:18:06] <selwyn> oh.
[02:18:49] <lotuseater> or catching what people say from a distance with LASER by the vibrations of the window glass
[02:19:31] *** Joins: selwyn_ (~selwyn@user/selwyn)
[02:22:20] *** Quits: selwyn (~selwyn@user/selwyn) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[02:23:44] <gilberth> The carrier you use to mix the incoming signal not the carrier of the radio signal itself by an even fraction of it. Hence when that frequency could be recepted, you know that there is a receiver, and tell which station you're listening. And as an antenna is connected to the radio, this could, if careless, radiate rather well.
[02:24:52] <selwyn_> yes i see
[02:25:32] <gilberth> Was an issue in Nazi Germany, as you could be executed for listening BBC.
[02:26:21] <gilberth> Regardless of whether you paid the fees or not. :)
[02:26:45] <selwyn_> lol
[02:27:02] <gilberth> selwyn: Anyhow, here each household has to pay the fee for TV and radio, even if you don't own a receiver at all.
[02:27:10] <selwyn_> oh
[02:27:14] <selwyn_> that sucks
[02:27:34] <gilberth> Therefore I call that a house hold tax.
[02:27:38] <selwyn_> the bbc is very unpopular now, i don´t know what its future will be
[02:27:42] *** Joins: dave0 (~davezero@069.d.003.ncl.iprimus.net.au)
[02:28:05] <dave0> maw
[02:28:37] <lotuseater> yes because you *could* watch all day via internet such great things like Musikantenstadl or other highly intellectual demanding things
[02:28:39] <gilberth> What's wrong with the BBC? I somehow know it for good news. Heh, even my grandfather listened to it.
[02:29:12] <gilberth> lotuseater: Even with no internet, you still have to pay the fee.
[02:29:15] <selwyn_> the right wing hates it, the left wing doesn´t like it
[02:29:28] <selwyn_> the government is generally very successful at domesticating it
[02:29:40] <selwyn_> its becoming a mouthpiece for them
[02:29:41] <gilberth> So this leaves the upper wing to like it. I see.
[02:30:10] <selwyn_> personally i think it is of very low quality, but i would still miss their cultural and sports coverage
[02:30:15] <lotuseater> or some weeks ago a spot about IBM putting one of their quantum computers here, one politician said "Now the days of classical computing are over." wtf
[02:30:32] <lotuseater> yes I know gilberth, had it often :)
[02:31:47] <selwyn_> recently, a bbc board member with ties to the government tried to block an appointment on the grounds that the government’s ‘fragile trust in the BBC [would] be shattered’
[02:31:52] <selwyn_> does that sound like an independent broadcaster
[02:32:12] <gilberth> I still remember the love letters from the radio stations telling me I would watch TV illegally, I ignored those letters, as I didn't own a TV nor a radio.
[02:32:16] <lotuseater> most of them don't know anything what they're talking about or even worse, what their position requires
[02:32:50] * gilberth doesn't watch TV at all.
[02:33:00] <lotuseater> me too
[02:33:14] <gilberth> Waste of time.
[02:33:33] <lotuseater> so you can concentrate on nuclear energy ;)
[02:33:38] <gilberth> My cousin watches TV^WNetflix all the day. He should rather clean the kitchen :/
[02:33:56] <selwyn_> ibm have a qc in germany?
[02:34:44] <lotuseater> yes selwyn_, and in the future there should be provided around 2 billion for more research
[02:35:38] <lotuseater> I was anyway again independently come to this topic for me, but of course still a lot to learn, because also a lot comes together. :)
[02:36:40] <selwyn_> nice
[02:36:41] <lotuseater> was funny when I had been some months into Common Lisp and then saw this great video by computerphile with Robert Smith
[02:36:42] * gilberth doesn't know much about quantum physics.
[02:37:09] <lotuseater> and even more important, quantum mechanics ^^
[02:37:28] <selwyn_> we used an ibm qc for some demonstrations but the qubits were not very high quality for our purposes unfortunately
[02:37:32] <gilberth> Whatever, I ought to learn that stuff.
[02:37:55] <lotuseater> it's okay
[02:38:06] <gilberth> I hope I don't have to brush up too much math.
[02:38:21] <lotuseater> selwyn_: they're offering a cloud service like rigetti, right? with this qiskit stuff
[02:38:35] <selwyn_> there are many cloud services
[02:38:41] <lotuseater> gilberth: so be glad :)
[02:38:48] <selwyn_> i think we did use qiskit
[02:39:32] <lotuseater> yes, I now told some people it's not the sense every one has such thing at home :D
[02:39:37] <gilberth> lotuseater: Glad about what? My poor math skills?
[02:39:48] <lotuseater> no that you don't need too much
[02:39:58] <gilberth> ok
[02:40:51] <lotuseater> do you know the video with stylewarning?
[02:41:08] <gilberth> I am better at CS stuff. Math made me reject to study physics, although I find that a very exciting topic.
[02:41:45] <lotuseater> it is. but too abstract i even don't like
[02:42:05] <gilberth> Abstract is fine. I like it abstract.
[02:42:37] <lotuseater> not in the sense as i meant

[02:42:45] <gilberth> Anyhow, as I get better mentally, I have the urge to learn something. I would like to pick up a language too.
[02:43:03] <lotuseater> you mean a human language?
[02:43:14] <gilberth> Yes.
[02:43:39] <selwyn_> there is someone trying to build a trapped ion qc in his garage
[02:43:51] <lotuseater> hehe nice
[02:46:09] <gilberth> Would I have the space, the tools and the motivation, I would try to etch chips.
[02:47:09] <gilberth> Which is not exactly rocket science.
[02:50:18] * selwyn_ wonders if he could do quantum things in germany
[02:51:27] <lotuseater> okay why specially here? ^^
[02:52:06] <selwyn_> well, i am reading about this recent national quantum initiative
[02:52:12] <selwyn_> it´s news to me
[02:54:14] <lotuseater> in Austria there's also something like this, some companies (or explicitely I heard from one)
[02:55:04] <selwyn_> austria is strong in qc at the academic level
[02:56:43] <lotuseater> yes and that's a good thing
[03:05:09] <gilberth> Not much happening here up north, I guess.
[03:07:15] <edgar-rft> gilberth: you could try learning Bavarian as a new language :-)

[07:31:05] <hayley> gilberth: Right, we do need to duplicate there. But AIUI we only need to duplicate in the context of a Kleene star?
[07:33:07] * hayley is trying to figure out where we can get away with not duplicating without doing data-flow analysis, which seems to boil down to some kind of linear logic.
[07:44:17] <hayley> gilberth: Any ideas for a RE which has some tag once, doesn't involve a Kleene star but requires duplicating to work? My current guess is that Kleene is the only thing which makes you need duplication.

[16:47:17] * hayley continues to get nerd sniped by non-concurrent hash table talk
[16:48:03] <shka> hayley: gosh, you do realize that concurrent hash table is in practice a solution to niche problem
[16:48:31] <shka> that not many people are actually encountering
[16:48:42] <hayley> shka: Yeah, well, 50k reads/second on one thread is probably worse than CPython with its interpreter and GIL.
[16:49:16] <shka> well, we can check
[16:49:40] <hayley> Right, I have python3 open and I just need to figure out what 0.0567 means as a time.
[16:50:48] <hayley> So timeit.timeit does a million repetitions, which means that CPython can do 17 million hash table reads a second.
[16:51:27] <hayley> In other words, this way of making hash tables "thread safe" (which I don't buy given you can't do atomic updates) makes your tables literally 340 times as slow as Python.
[16:52:42] <hayley> And I guess it's not even the "concurrent" part BTW; it's even 200x slower than using a fucking lock!
[16:53:02] <shka> eh, to be fair, python dicts have a separate opcode for access
[16:53:07] <shka> (yes, seriously)
[16:53:26] <hayley> Thought as much; they'd microcode the hash table lookup in C.
[16:54:44] <hayley> But you get the idea, right? It's awfully slow, and basically useless because you can't reliably update things.
[16:56:33] <shka> what is cl-gserver anyway?
[16:56:56] <hayley> Apparently the world's worst locking library.
[16:57:26] <hayley> "If you want to use a lock, use a lock. Luckily everyone can decide for himself" BUT IT PROVIDES YOU THE EXACT SAME DAMN GUARANTEES AS A LOCK BUT HUNDREDS OF TIMES SLOWER!!
[16:58:02] <shka> you really getting worked up on this :D
[16:58:47] <hayley> How many years did I blow on hash table implementation again?
[16:59:37] <shka> and how many years lisp exists but people insist that (foo bar) is unacceptable syntax?
[16:59:49] <shka> that's how it is
[17:01:20] <hayley> concurrent-hash-tables is only a year and a month old. Hm. And it was tested in decentralise2-utilities for only a week.
[17:01:36] <shka> long story short, the objective reality rarely gets in the way of the personal conviction
[17:03:29] <hayley> Sure. But no one else actually checks this shit.
[17:04:21] <hayley> And I bet when I wake up tomorrow I'll be banned for being "rude" by calling out someone who was spreading misinformation again.
[17:09:21] <hayley> Though, one "good" thing which happened this weekend, I did research for my article and found out that the size of all my code (distributed hash table, object system, VM, client AND server, graphical interactor) actually compares favourably to that of a common client for a much more useless protocol.
[17:09:34] <hayley> Like 11kLOC to 7k or so. Makes me feel somewhat better about it.
[17:09:58] <shka> hayley: to be fair, this user, never mentioned that this is "fast"
[17:11:07] <hayley> Speaking of queues being slow, my first next move might be to chunk up queues, because the work we do per value to queue is so small that it's a bottleneck.
[17:12:28] <hayley> shka: Yeah, but 200x slower than locking seems...slow enough to not want to use it most of the time.
[17:12:50] <shka> hmmm depends
[17:15:12] <hayley> Right. If you touch it infrequently enough, you can get away with it. If you have small enough arrays, you can get away with bubble sort.

[17:57:34] <SAL9000> hayley: AFAIK, lockless data structures are still interesting even if they're slow -- sometimes you can get e.g. better guarantees of progress when compared to locking structures
[17:58:39] <hayley> SAL9000: Indeed. But I'm only in them to go fast.
[17:58:57] <SAL9000> guarantees of progress = whole system goes faster, because it's not deadlocked :-)
[17:59:20] <hayley> Note that 42nd-at-Threadmill is not wait free, since NBHM does weird stuff to make resizing wait free.
[17:59:42] <SAL9000> No idea what either of those are, sorry.
[18:00:05] <hayley> It is lock free, i.e. no deadlock but not wait free, i.e. threads sometimes just have to wait for resizing to finish.
[18:00:37] <SAL9000> Huh. How is the "wait for resizing" implemented w/o locks, though?
[18:00:39] <hayley> Two concurrent hash tables. I wrote the former for 6 core machines, Cliff Click wrote the latter for 864 core machines.
[18:00:57] <SAL9000> 864-core? Uh. That's oddly specific.
[18:03:53] <hayley> Maybe not lock free actually, but it doesn't deadlock. And iirc we spin until copying finishes, since it should be over with quick. (Note to self: do we thread-yield? That could help.)
[18:04:37] <hayley> 864 would be the most cores Azul put in one machine.
[18:05:00] <SAL9000> Azure* ?
[18:05:50] <hayley> No, Azul the Java mainframe company.
[18:05:56] <SAL9000> thread yield should help but watch out for flagfall cost if your spin time is short enough - maybe don't do it immediately
[18:06:05] <hayley> Right.
[18:06:35] <shka> Azul does not exists, right?
[18:06:53] <SAL9000> my understanding is that the win with spinlocks is avoiding the kernel-userspace context switch cost for a system call, so yielding would put that cost back again
[18:07:13] <shka> oh, they are actually still in the business
[18:08:17] <hayley> Click does lock-free resizing by doing a sort of two phase commit, where the value has a "tombstone" bit set, then you try to copy, then the value is stomped out of the old table. And still any thread can make progress as the value is still there; the tombstone bit is to stop new writers from updating the old table.
[18:09:17] <hayley> Now, I am lazy and when I deployed a port of the table, the throughput would plummet while resizing (which also is needed to flush deleted keys for technical raisins), I decided not to do that.
[18:11:41] <hayley> A not lock free resizing algorithm, unfortunately, appeared to go faster, but then again the CL port might have needed more optimization after I already poked at it for a few months.
[18:15:50] <hayley> Come to think of it, there are two things you could do to get the wait free technique up to "speed", which would be to commit to resizing the whole table rather than doing an incremental resize (as using a mid-resize table is slower and that hurts), and perhaps to make it easier to find work for resizing larger tables.
[18:17:40] <hayley> In my table threads get chunks of 1024 mappings to copy at a time. If we had a bit/byte/word/something map of chunks that weren't totally copied, we wouldn't have to scan it all to find something to copy.
[18:18:59] <hayley> shka: Yes, but AIUI they "only" do software now. (The quotes are because they apparently have a compacting GC with pause times in microseconds or something.)
[18:19:47] <shka> hayley: IIRC they use mechanism in the linux kernel that may use something in the intel 
[18:19:53] <shka> not sure about the second part
[18:20:50] <shka> but if yes, it may stop working after the update :P
[18:21:20] <hayley> Yeah, Cliff Click dropped the number on a hacker news comment once in 2016, which doesn't make for a good source.
