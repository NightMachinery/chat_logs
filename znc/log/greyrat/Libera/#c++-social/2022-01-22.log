[20:33:03] <Oxyd> The expensive new GPU might be faulty. /o\ I keep losing signal on my monitor after 25 minutes and nothing except reboot will bring it back on.
[20:36:59] <Crocodillian> most likely yes
[20:37:23] <Crocodillian> power cycling the monitor doesn't help either?
[20:37:42] <Oxyd> Nope.
[20:37:58] <Crocodillian> yeah get it replaced
[20:40:35] <Crocodillian> I think I basically understand move semantics and std::move() now finally

[20:42:45] <Crocodillian> I basically get unique_ptr, shared_ptr, and std::move(), and I have already been using things like auto, range based for loops, etc.. So I finally have the basic set of knowledge to write modern C++.
[20:47:59] <Crocodillian> I'm glad I read about this in "Beginning C++20" which is much more sufficiently idiot-level then what I was trying to read on the web

[22:25:36] <Oxyd> I may have figured out what's wrong with the GPU. If I don't start X, it simply sits there slowly warming and doesn't turn its fans on. If I start X, something happens and it starts cooling itself. I guess letting the hardware control the fans would be too difficult at this price point.
