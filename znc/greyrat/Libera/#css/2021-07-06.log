[07:55:02] <Rockwood> any active?
[08:04:15] <FunkyBob> you might want to be more specific... or narrow down your example to only the problematic thing
[08:15:02] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, sorry i was afk now back
[08:16:13] <Rockwood> actually dropdown->dropdown's li i want default line-height
[08:16:54] <Rockwood> as you can see i changed the both side bar line-height
[08:21:24] <Rockwood> i means products's submenu line height
[08:22:51] <FunkyBob> so it's the _side_ versions you're interested in changing
[08:23:30] <FunkyBob> why 137px??
[08:23:54] <FunkyBob> also, what _do_ you want it to look like?
[08:31:03] <Rockwood> actually both side menu having less items
[08:33:58] <Rockwood> i wanna do gap in between em
[08:34:02] <Rockwood> side menu
[08:38:14] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, ^^
[08:39:25] <Rockwood> menu should be adjustable and submenu should be hold default defined line-height
[08:48:06] <Rockwood> .AsideRight .hoverMenu .dropdown .dropdown {
[08:48:06] <Rockwood>   line-height: 21px;
[08:48:13] <Rockwood> it is also not sensing
[08:48:18] <Rockwood> oops
[08:50:25] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, there?
[08:51:17] <Rockwood> dropdown list should be less line-height
[09:04:48] <Rockwood> \o/
[09:04:51] <Rockwood> done ty
[09:05:41] <Rockwood> .AsideRight .hoverMenu ul li ul.dropdown li > a {
[09:05:41] <Rockwood>   line-height: 21px;
[09:05:45] <Rockwood> nice
[09:07:11] <FunkyBob> you know line-height can be a ratio, right?
