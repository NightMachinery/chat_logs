[03:00:03] <FromDiscord> <creonico> Hey, I get `cannot evaluate at compile time: physical_device_count` when declaring this array `var physical_devices:array[physical_device_count, VkPhysicalDevice];`. `physical_device_count` is 0 before a fuction call that changes its value to the amount of devices there are. After that, I declare the array with the error using `physical_device_count`'s new value
[03:03:46] <FromDiscord> <@bracketmaster-5a708063d73408ce4> nim really doesn't like the length param of any arrays to be non-const during compile time
[03:03:48] <FromDiscord> <@bracketmaster-5a708063d73408ce4> apparently
[03:10:08] <FromDiscord> <creonico> So how can I achieve that? In C it gives me no issue
[03:10:53] <FromDiscord> <carmysilna> You can use `seq` instead of an array
[03:14:38] <FromDiscord> <creonico> Seq?
[03:14:43] <FromDiscord> <creonico> What is that ._.
[03:16:29] <FromDiscord> <@bracketmaster-5a708063d73408ce4> it means sequence in nim
[03:18:07] <FromDiscord> <creonico> ok
[03:19:08] <FromDiscord> <@bracketmaster-5a708063d73408ce4> not sure that nim would have a binding for `physical_devices:seq[VkPhysicalDevice]` as it seems you're using some vulkan binding
[03:26:31] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> well `physical_devices = newSeq[VKPhysicalDevice](physical_device_count)` ðŸ˜„
[03:27:22] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> It's not that it doesnt like it but it has to be a compile time value, could make a `FixedSeq` type to give similar syntax to an array
[03:31:15] <FromDiscord> <carmysilna> In reply to @creonico "Hey, I get `cannot": the reasoning behind this is that nim needs to be able to calculate the length of the array at comptime so that it can compile the array efficiently and check for array out of bounds errors
[03:31:46] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> the main reason is that arrays are all9cated on the stack
[03:32:05] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> and the stack size has to be known at compile time
[03:33:14] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> Well here's a start for that fixed seq really should make this a package ðŸ˜„
[03:33:14] <FromDiscord> <@bracketmaster-5a708063d73408ce4> it seems that nim 1.5 allows for custom number literal operators
[03:33:15] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3tE8
[03:33:19] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> Yes
[03:33:25] <FromDiscord> <@bracketmaster-5a708063d73408ce4> specifically, `'something`

[03:34:08] <FromDiscord> <@bracketmaster-5a708063d73408ce4> but it seems that operator only allows for number literals?
[03:34:31] <FromDiscord> <Tuatarian> is there a findall function built into sequtils?
[03:34:44] <FromDiscord> <Tuatarian> wasn't able to find one, could implement myself but I think this is something that should really be in the stdlib
[03:34:49] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> `filterit`
[03:34:54] <FromDiscord> <Tuatarian> indices
[03:34:54] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> `filter`
[03:35:10] <FromDiscord> <Tuatarian> is there a way to grab indices from filter?
[03:35:36] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> nope

[03:36:23] <FromDiscord> <Tuatarian> it's not hard to implement for sure

[03:36:55] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> Possibly
[03:37:06] <FromDiscord> <Tuatarian> or maybe just add it to fusion
[03:37:19] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> honestly, there doesn't need to be a combinator for everything
[03:37:46] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> there are hundreds if "missing" combinators that are useful

[03:38:56] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> and if the `sequtils` stuff worked on iterators instead of seqs, you could probably combine a filter combinator with a combinator that provides access to the index
[03:39:23] <FromDiscord> <@bracketmaster-5a708063d73408ce4> Not seeing any documentation on the `'` operator that comes with nim 1.5 tho
[03:39:24] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> without or with low additional cost, that is
[03:39:25] <FromDiscord> <carmysilna> can't you `toSeq` an iterator
[03:39:45] <FromDiscord> <Tuatarian> is there a find iterator?
[03:39:59] <FromDiscord> <Tuatarian> don't remember there being a find iterator
[03:40:11] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> In reply to @carmysilna "can't you `toSeq` an": sure, but the combinators take and return a seq, which means lots of intermediate allocations when combining them
[03:40:45] <FromDiscord> <Tuatarian> this kind of thing is my primary concern with contributing to nim stdlib or fusion
[03:41:10] <FromDiscord> <Tuatarian> I'm not super knowledgable interms of effciency

[03:41:35] <FromDiscord> <Tuatarian> huh
[03:41:40] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> a `filterWithIbdex` wouldn't be inefficient
[03:41:42] <FromDiscord> <Tuatarian> would have expected it to be in sequtils
[03:41:55] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> my point is that it shouldn't be necessary in the first place
[03:42:06] <FromDiscord> <Tuatarian> it's not, for sure
[03:42:13] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> sewutils is for stuff that works on seqs, nit stuff that works for any iterable
[03:42:18] <FromDiscord> <Tuatarian> I see

[03:42:25] <FromDiscord> <Tuatarian> openarrays yeah

[03:42:27] <FromDiscord> <Zoom> @Tuatarian\: zero\_functional's `enumerate` confusingly outputs original indices even after filtering. I even opened an issue on that, but it remained unresolved
[03:42:27] <FromDiscord> <Tuatarian> fair enough
[03:42:51] <FromDiscord> <carmysilna> In reply to @iWonderAboutTuatara "is there a find": `seq.filter(pred)[0]` should work
[03:43:19] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> well ideally we do this with 0 allocations
[03:43:27] <FromDiscord> <konsumlamm> it would, but it first allocates a seq

[06:47:27] <mib> but when iterating over the list and spawning the proc for each item, they only echo 8 items before the program exits

[06:47:56] <mib> there are 16 total items, i added an extra echo before that which will echo the name in the list, and it suddenly corrects the issue and spawns all 16 procs

[06:54:17] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> Though that EOF issue is odd
[06:57:01] <FromDiscord> <ElegantBeef> So this crashes in the for loop with the `spawn`  statement?

[20:17:56] <FromDiscord> <Bung> what's the `0n` means ? "BigInt64Array The contents are initialized to 0n"  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt64Array
[20:20:08] <FromDiscord> <Rika> isnt that js
[20:21:58] <FromDiscord> <Rika> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#numeric_literals
[20:22:04] <FromDiscord> <Rika> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3tHQ
[20:31:46] <FromDiscord> <Bung> this make me confusing https://github.com/nim-lang/RFCs/issues/187
[20:32:10] <FromDiscord> <Bung> js: use BigInt64Array or BigInt instead of Number for int64, int, uint64, uint
[20:33:43] <FromDiscord> <Bung> so BigInt64Array is array of bigint, the title metioned there with BigInt at same position.

[20:35:54] <FromDiscord> <Bung> @timotheecour can you confirm this ?
[21:05:06] <FromDiscord> <timotheecour> it's maybe poorly worded but the idea would be to use it in the implementation of `int64` to preserve 64-bit semantics; it's one of the options worth considering.
[21:07:02] <FromDiscord> <Bung> ah, I get that, so it's for maping pointer offset ?

[21:16:08] <emery> is it possible to use `NimNode` at runtime to implement code translation tools? 
[21:17:11] <emery> stuff like `stdout.writeLine newEmptyNode().repr` doesn't work at runtime
[21:18:49] <emery> I can do what I want with a macro but I'd rather have the generated code in a discrete file to inspect
[21:19:55] <FromDiscord> <Bung> I think you can use compiler package parse your code then do translation
[21:21:35] <FromDiscord> <@bracketmaster-5a708063d73408ce4> @ynfle  - thx
[21:37:30] <FromDiscord> <Ayy Lmao> Does anyone have any experience using nimgl or imgui? When I call `igCreateContext()` using `--cc:vcc`, I get the error: `error C2233: 'tyArraylESWtzMXx1doP9aJU66a9ciw': arrays of objects containing zero-size arrays are illegal` but I don't get that error when I don't use `--cc:vcc`

[22:18:00] <fn> <06Prestige99> never used that site though
[22:18:03] <FromDiscord> <RattleyCooper> @treeform I've been trying to run the examples from your `ws` library but for some reason all the custom exceptions aside from `WebSocketError` are throwing an undeclared identifier error.  I see they exist in the source so I am not sure what's going on.
[22:20:38] <FromDiscord> <Hi02Hi> even if it was up,  treeform doesnt trust it enough to have it work on any page. the github page says "It is alpha quality, so if you want to be included in the allowed authors list, open a pull request."
[22:22:03] <FromDiscord> <RattleyCooper> I'm not trying to host any docs I was looking for the docs for his `ws` library.  It's ok though, I'm sure it'll be back up eventually.  If I can figure out why these undeclared identifier errors are popping up I can probably just look at the examples
[22:22:29] <FromDiscord> <RattleyCooper> (edit) "I'm not trying to host any docs I was looking for the docs for his `ws` library.  It's ok though, I'm sure it'll be back up eventually.

[22:41:23] <FromDiscord> <treeform> In reply to @RattleyCooper "<@!107140179025735680> I've been trying": Can you open a Issue with an reproducible example and stack trace? If you put in the time to chase it down, i'll fix it. Make sure you only have one WS installed and none of your modules are called ws.
[22:43:46] <FromDiscord> <RattleyCooper> In reply to @treeform "Can you open a": How do I check for multiple installations?
[22:45:13] <FromDiscord> <treeform> In reply to @RattleyCooper "How do I check": find your `~/.nimble/pgks` folder
[22:45:18] <FromDiscord> <treeform> it will have a folder for every install
[22:45:29] <FromDiscord> <treeform> ws-#.#.# or some thing is the format
[22:45:58] <FromDiscord> <RattleyCooper> Ok, I only have 1 installed, I'll open an issue
[22:46:21] <FromDiscord> <treeform> ok
[22:48:55] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> In addition to `compiler/ast` you can also try to use my library for `PNode` manipulations - https://haxscramper.github.io/hnimast/src/hnimast/hast_common.html . I do a ton of nim codegen, and this library is designed to make operations on `NimNode` and `PNode` completely interoperable
[22:50:05] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Also I have `pquote do:` that works like `quote do:`, but generates PNode
[22:53:57] <FromDiscord> <dom96> In reply to @treeform "find your `~/.nimble/pgks` folder": Pro-tip: you can also use `nimble list --installed | grep "ws"`
