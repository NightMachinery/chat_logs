[06:30:28] <FunkyBob> imho sessions are an orthogonal concern to auth... in fact, storing that you are auth'd in the session makes more sense to me

[07:17:43] *** Rockwood_ is now known as Rockwood
[07:18:46] <FunkyBob> the backend must not ever trust the front end. basic web rule since forever.
[07:19:07] <FunkyBob> it must limit and filter what data it will return to the frontend based on the credentials/auth/ etc
[07:19:36] <Rockwood> so??
[07:19:40] <FunkyBob> so
[07:19:43] <FunkyBob> what?
[07:19:54] <Rockwood> should i do twice everything
[07:19:55] <Rockwood> ?
[07:19:58] <FunkyBob> huh?
[07:20:10] <FunkyBob> again, it's not clear what you're asking for.
[07:20:13] <Rockwood> how to filter the auth then
[07:20:13] <FunkyBob> something about auth
[07:20:28] <FunkyBob> filter what?
[07:20:34] <Rockwood> oops
[07:21:00] <Rockwood> hows your code handle the auth?
[07:21:07] <Rockwood> in react
[07:21:20] <Rockwood> backend to frontend
[07:21:27] <FunkyBob> it passes the bearer token to the backend
[07:21:44] <Rockwood> only bearer
[07:21:52] <Rockwood> anymore data too?
[07:21:55] <FunkyBob> with session based auth, it doesn't even need to do that, since it's in the session, which is keyed by a cookie
[07:22:03] <FunkyBob> why would it need more?
[07:22:34] <Rockwood> how to know which user id authenticated?
[07:23:07] <Rockwood> as you can see me too passing bearer token
[07:23:26] <FunkyBob> then that's how you know
[07:23:38] <Rockwood> means
[07:23:48] <FunkyBob> when it comes to tokens and delegation... you don't need to know the user... just the authorization
[07:24:42] <FunkyBob> why?
[07:24:44] <Rockwood> suppose i need loggedin user data on dashboard of login user then
[07:24:52] <FunkyBob> then ask for the logged in user
[07:25:22] <Rockwood> from where i can get the loggedin user?
[07:25:40] <FunkyBob> that depends on how your auth works.
[07:25:46] <FunkyBob> either your backend, or your auth service
[07:25:59] <FunkyBob> given that seems to be handled in your boackend... there.
[07:26:01] <FunkyBob> ask it
[07:26:08] <FunkyBob> backend, even
[07:26:09] <Rockwood> its means i need backend session value too?
[07:26:25] <FunkyBob> how is session not _only_ on the backend?
[07:26:42] <FunkyBob> then again, if your auth token is really an auth token, it should be enough for your backend to know who it's for
[07:27:03] <Rockwood> token also stores the id?
[07:27:16] <Rockwood> i means more values
[07:27:25] <Rockwood> along with token
[07:27:34] <FunkyBob> you tell me.. it's your token
[07:27:41] <Rockwood> no
[07:27:56] <FunkyBob> https://github.com/Cyberiaaxis/Rocky/blob/master/resources/js/components/LoginForm.js#L28-L31
[07:27:59] <FunkyBob> yes
[07:28:19] <FunkyBob> you post to your auth/login endpoint, it gives you an access token
[07:28:22] <FunkyBob> it's your token
[07:28:48] <FunkyBob> you control that code... I know nothing about it
[07:28:56] <Rockwood> https://gist.github.com/Cyberiaaxis/2209e179a74818969a30ff7238dc5e1a
[07:28:57] <FunkyBob> so don't ask me to reason about how to use it
[07:29:14] <Rockwood> ah okay
[07:29:29] <FunkyBob> what does YOUR code put in the token?
[07:29:34] <FunkyBob> what does YOUR code know about the token?
[07:29:40] <FunkyBob> what does YOUR code relate to the token?
[07:30:11] <Rockwood> auth and userData 2 different things, am right?
[07:30:25] <FunkyBob> potentially
[07:30:34] <FunkyBob> there's authorisation, and authentication...
[07:30:43] <FunkyBob> what you're allowed to do, and who you are...
[07:30:51] <FunkyBob> they are the two `auth`s
[07:31:19] <Rockwood> and roles?
[07:31:25] <Rockwood> auth and role
[07:31:27] <FunkyBob> your system has roles?
[07:31:33] <Rockwood> yes
[07:31:39] <FunkyBob> and I would know that because...?
[07:31:48] <FunkyBob> tyically roles are a way to manage authorisation
[07:32:46] <FunkyBob> but then... you implemented the roles... so you tell me what they mean in YOUR system

[07:33:59] <FunkyBob> why don't YOU know what your code does?
[07:34:28] <Rockwood> in backend i do that easily
[07:34:36] <Rockwood> but JS is confusing me
[07:34:37] <FunkyBob> in backend is where it's happening
[07:34:53] <Rockwood> in my login controller
[07:35:46] <FunkyBob> ?
[07:36:04] <Rockwood> https://github.com/Cyberiaaxis/Rocky/blob/master/app/Http/Controllers/LoginController.php
[07:36:27] <Rockwood> this is my login controller handling in backend
[07:37:03] <FunkyBob> oksushi: does PHP normally use the wrong slashes? or is this an artifact of Windows?
[07:37:37] <FunkyBob> Rockwood: not sure why you showed me that, but ok
[07:37:57] <Rockwood> i wanna show my logic of login in backend
[07:38:15] <FunkyBob> ok
[07:38:18] <FunkyBob> not sure how it's relevant
[07:38:50] <FunkyBob> you seem to be working with locally stored random tokens.
[07:39:07] <Rockwood> yes
[07:39:24] <FunkyBob> and there's some hints that you could look up a user based on a given token... but that's purely a guess
[07:39:33] <FunkyBob> because you haven't told me anywhere near enough to know for sure
[07:40:35] <Rockwood> $random = Str::random(60);  its generating string of token
[07:40:50] <FunkyBob> yes, I guessed that
[07:40:54] <FunkyBob> not interested in that tiny mechanism
[07:41:02] <FunkyBob> it's everything OUTSIDE that module that matters
[07:42:08] <Rockwood> my backend cares everything already
[07:42:15] <FunkyBob> so where's the problem?
[07:42:26] <Rockwood> so i wanna just use it instead creates another in frontend
[07:42:35] <FunkyBob> another what?
[07:42:48] <Rockwood> like session values
[07:43:06] <Rockwood> session is set in backend already
[07:43:23] <Rockwood> for get userId
[07:43:48] <Rockwood> after it i can manage easily frontend
[07:44:00] <FunkyBob> session is a backend only thing
[07:44:37] <Rockwood> i think id i get user id on route its only and the best way
[07:44:49] <FunkyBob> you already have the user ID
[07:45:01] <FunkyBob> and, more important, their authorization token
[07:45:29] <Rockwood>  const result = await Fetch("auth/login", { method: "post", data });  am right doing?

[07:45:50] <FunkyBob> depends on what format the data are in

[07:48:27] <Rockwood> JS based
[07:48:35] <Rockwood> JS object
[07:48:40] <FunkyBob> you had a reason to use it... what was that reason?
[07:48:44] <FunkyBob> JS object is NOT JSON
[07:48:47] <FunkyBob> JSON is a string
[07:49:32] <FunkyBob> so your Fetch library is a wrapper around a wrapper around fetch

[22:22:11] <oksushi> harriet_tubman: it always makes sense to use the most appropriate HTML element
[22:22:30] <oksushi> what that is will absolutely depend on the content and context
[22:23:35] <harriet_tubman> oksushi: this is for a regular react web application, what are some of the problems that arise from using divs for all text elements? thank you
[22:24:09] <oksushi> the problem is apparent when you disable CSS
[22:25:31] <oksushi> I just noticed you also asked in #html — all of those reasons are valid, too
[22:26:07] <oksushi> in short: HTML has a range of elements _for a reason_, and you should use them to make sure that the meaning of your content is understood
[22:26:44] <oksushi> yes, you can create a page styling nothing but <div> elements, but as <div> has no semantic value, there is no structure to your document

[22:32:52] <oksushi> I’m sure that you could argue whatever you wanted (this is the Internet — people argue all manner of silly positions!)

[22:39:46] <oksushi> there’s one other problem — whoever developed a React app using only <div> would most likely be asked to rebuild it once it came to light they only used <div>. Assuming it’s being built for a stakeholder somewhere
