[00:48:44] <blahboybaz> I hope that isn't just more confusing
[00:49:23] <terminalpusher> I have a Java question here because #java doesn't let me join. If I have `enum MyEnum { A, B }` and I do `MyEnum[] types = new MyEnum[5];`, what is the best way to have that `types` array also be initialized with MyEnum.A? Do I need to `for` through it or is there a better way to do that?
[00:49:39] <bjs> blahboybaz: I mean at the most basic level the world is made up of objects,  and once you stop using an object (the last variable that referenced it goes away for example) then the object can be deleted.

[01:09:41] <blahboybaz> Maybe I have a wrong idea here. I thought that the code the dev writes would be responsible for one of the two in the pairing (either they key or the value - of any specific element in the WeakMap) and then the gc would handl the remaining thing.
[01:10:04] <blahboybaz> I didn't think we had a method to retrieve keys in a WeakMap (only values) - I'll have to look again
[01:10:24] <bjs> blahboybaz: i mean, just forgetting all the weak stuff for now a weakmap is just a map. The dev has to .set(key,value) pairs and then .get(key) to get the value out later

[01:11:22] <blahboybaz> I was wrong - its the keys we ooerate on - then, apparently, gc deletes the corresponding value after a key has been removed?
[01:11:32] <[itchyjunk]> and i do a `double b + (int) a;`
[01:11:43] <[itchyjunk]> a gets casted to int, which it alredy is
[01:11:47] <[itchyjunk]> then it sees b is a double
[01:11:51] <[itchyjunk]> then it casts a to double
[01:11:52] <bjs> blahboybaz: not necessarily, the value is just an object. if the value is being used elsewhere it won't be deleted
[01:11:58] <[itchyjunk]> and i get a `double + double` right?
[01:12:25] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: `double b + (int) a;` doesn't look like valid syntax,  is there some part missing?
[01:13:35] <[itchyjunk]> it's `b + (int) a;`
[01:13:55] <[itchyjunk]> where b is a double
[01:14:05] <[itchyjunk]> i was mentally thinking it and ended up typing
[01:14:38] <blahboybaz> bjs: This is where I get confused. I almost wish I could cut out some shapes with construction paper and move them around to 'see' what is going on in a WeakMap. Problem is I woulddn't know what to do with my peices of paper (hense the fact that I"m asking the questions to begin with). 
[01:14:47] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: `a_double + a_int` will cast the int to a double and then do addition over the doubles
[01:15:03] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: this is one place where the details will be different in each language so be careful
[01:15:05] <blahboybaz> I'm trying to create a diagram of what I'm trying to accomplish maybe that will help somehow
[01:15:06] <[itchyjunk]> right
[01:15:27] <[itchyjunk]> a was already a int so i was wondering if (int) a somehow forced it to be int and broke it
[01:15:53] <bjs> blahboybaz: the way these languages with objects work is that the pieces of paper (the objects) just live in a big box at the side and inside the map is just some numbers that refer to pieces of paper, and the variables have numbers that refer to bits of paper etc
[01:15:55] <[itchyjunk]> but looks like (b + (int) a) casts a (which is an int) to int, then sees that b is a double so then casts a to a double then adds
[01:16:47] <[itchyjunk]> and if i did `int % long;` i guess int gets casted to a long?
[01:16:53] <bjs> blahboybaz: a garbage collector goes through the box and looks to see if the object's number appears anywhere on the table and if it doesn't, it throws it away because you're not using it.  WeakMap adds a caveat, that if the number only appears as a key in a WeakMap then you can throw it away still

[02:50:08] <[itchyjunk]> yeah i thought that one was more redablle too
[02:50:34] <pyzozord> "if screen is not small or [screen is small and] button is pressed". The part in [] makes it more verbose. Being explicit is good, it helps understanding. Being verbose is not good, it distracts. Consider the reader of your code has a litmited amount of time and mental energy to understand your code. Provide all information necessary, but not more.
[02:51:13] <[itchyjunk]> so if i have (1/2) * double, it tries to convert (1/2) to double
[02:51:26] <[itchyjunk]> but why is it getting converted to 0.0 ?
[02:51:41] <pyzozord> You can let your code be a little verbose in more hairy places, to help strech out things that are too dense with ideas. But if the concept is simple enough, additional spreading is not more helpful

[02:58:51] <beaky> yes to store fractions in a double you should use the decimal notation like double x = 0.5 or double x = 1.0 / 2.0 so that java knows you are dividing double precision floating point constants rather than doing a division on two integers

[03:00:51] <[itchyjunk]> i've seen them personally

[05:08:42] <Izem> Remind me why programms use modular arithmetic?
[05:09:15] <mawk> because it's often needed Izem ?
[05:09:19] <mawk> what kind of question is that
[05:09:37] <Izem> idk
[05:10:06] <webNET4> for types that are supposed to wrap without UB
[05:10:12] <beaky> modular arithmetic is often needed because lots of things wrap around and modular arithmetic lets you quantify while wrapping around
[05:10:16] <Izem> I couldn't think of an example where I needed to use those properties  for integers
[05:10:47] <webNET4> incrementing hours or minutes on a clock face
[05:10:50] <beaky> one example of wrapping around is when you want to process a stream of data in a finite buffer so you 'wrap around' the buffer
[05:10:59] <mawk> for instance if you are printing integers from an array Izem , and you want to print a newline each time you've printed 50 objects
[05:11:01] <mawk> so it's easier to read
[05:11:02] <[itchyjunk]> cryptography is 40% modular arithmatic
[05:12:20] <Izem> oh ok
[05:12:31] <mawk> so you do for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { printf("%d ", list[i]); if ((i > 0) && ((i % 50) == 0)) { printf("\n"); } }
[05:12:50] <Izem> only thing I could think of is that is makes certain operations complete
[05:13:15] <Izem> and it is not difficult to implement

[05:14:53] <webNET4> in a language like Ada you can increment a "Natural" type, but it will raise a constraing_error if it overflows, or maybe its an overflow exception i forget. but a modular type will allow wrapping increment without exception

[17:37:23] <phogg> [itchyjunk]: I am using it to separate my code example from my comment about that code. It's just the java line comment syntax.
[17:37:24] <[itchyjunk]> there's thousands remaining
[17:37:59] <novns> like Yoga Sutras of Patanjali
[17:38:07] <novns> this one is interesting
[17:38:08] <sandman> novns: things with translation is they often lose meaning
[17:38:10] <jinsun> sandman: so did you learn the differnce between श and ष? I have no idea how the two are different in pronunciation, स is obviously different
[17:38:11] <phogg> [itchyjunk]: I don't see why you need a comment saying that the string has been split over multiple lines, anyone reading the code can see that at a glance.
[17:38:37] <novns> sandman, it's nice to learn obscure languages, but don't expect much fun

[17:38:58] <[itchyjunk]> phogg, fair enough
[17:39:04] <[itchyjunk]> i thought it would be silly to comment that too
[17:39:11] <phogg> [itchyjunk]: I would not have the first three comments at all.
[17:39:47] <phogg> [itchyjunk]: the final comment *just* passes muster as explaining something that may not be obvious at a glance.
[17:40:02] <[itchyjunk]> phogg, i wouldn't typically but this is assignment ..
[17:40:14] <[itchyjunk]> and 75% of the grade is "style point" this week
[17:40:33] <[itchyjunk]> so putting in useless things to make it look like an honest effort
[17:40:47] <phogg> [itchyjunk]: if your teacher thinks you should comment like this then he or she needs a stern talking to. 
[17:40:59] <[itchyjunk]> they do :/
[17:41:16] <phogg> "int x = 1; // assign the integer 1 to x" this is the kind of comment which is worse than useless and should be avoided
[17:41:19] <[itchyjunk]> they mentioned explaining your through process in english so anyone can read your commends and understand what's going on
[17:41:23] <sandman> jinsun: Yeah. there are differences. For ष, try uttering 't' of tour and produce hissing sound, for 'श' try pronouncing 'ch' of change and produce hissing sound

[17:41:29] <phogg> [itchyjunk]: that's not at all the same thing
[17:41:33] <sandman> jinsun: that's the closest approximation
[17:41:49] <phogg> [itchyjunk]: explaining what's going on in English is fine, literally repeating word for word what your code is doing at every statement is not.

[17:42:17] <[itchyjunk]> phogg, the example code provided in class did this "get user input" "now display it" etc

[20:30:01] <GeDaMo> The URL is just a name, it doesn't always translate directly to a file on the server
[20:30:25] <vdamewood> Izem: Usually, when you see foo.html, it's because the backend runs by serving files from a directory, and it just serves whatever is at the requested location.
[20:31:05] <vdamewood> So, if you request http://example.com/foo/bar.html, the web server just grabs what's at /srv/htttpd/foo/bar.html and serves it up.

[22:01:29] <smallville7123> [itchyjunk]: do you mean, like how do you do X based on runtime data Z
[22:01:39] <GeDaMo> so if the condition is false, jump to one place if it's true jump to a different place

[22:04:43] <[itchyjunk]> but this one is jumping to another location!?
[22:05:08] <GeDaMo> The differences between 'branch' and 'jump' vary across systems

[22:05:24] <[itchyjunk]> seems very nuanced
[22:05:40] <[itchyjunk]> smallville7123, right. so doesn't jump also satisfy that criteria
[22:05:40] <smallville7123> its basically like a tree of sorts
[22:05:49] <GeDaMo> CPUs usually have conditional branch instructions
[22:05:50] <[itchyjunk]> it jumps to different memory location so different parts of the code
[22:05:59] <[itchyjunk]> ah
[22:06:16] <smallville7123> [itchyjunk]: a branch can be IMPLEMENTED using a jump
[22:06:22] <GeDaMo> Some kinds of decision can be replaced with calculations

[22:10:25] <GeDaMo> Instead of e.g. adding two numbers together, it can add multiple sets of two numbers together
[22:11:00] <smallville7123> basically it is an instruction that does the work of multiple instructions in a single instruction
[22:11:26] <smallville7123> for example, adding multiple numbers at the same time, instead of adding each individually

[22:41:24] <pyzozord> ah, yes I think that was it!
[22:42:08] <smallville7123> note that "The standard also recommends replacing each error with the replacement character "�" (U+FFFD)." is what MOST programs do when they encounter a file containing invalid text such as an executable or even SOME, BUT NOT ALL, terminals (most terminals NEED to handle certain sequences to provide functionallity such as entering into RAW input mode, clearing the screen, ect(
[22:42:39] <pyzozord> oh and "lolcat" too
[22:44:03] <smallville7123> but getting something to be unicode-correct, in that it handles all unicode errors, is generally not an easy feat and will usually rely on a library that already does this
[22:44:38] <smallville7123> simply due to the immense number of valid unicode combinations
[22:47:06] <smallville7123> also "Since RFC 3629 (November 2003), the high and low surrogate halves used by UTF-16 (U+D800 through U+DFFF) and code points not encodable by UTF-16 (those after U+10FFFF) are not legal Unicode values, and their UTF-8 encoding must be treated as an invalid byte sequence"
[22:48:30] <smallville7123> which i assume means that "U+D800 through U+DFFF" is valid UTF-16, and invalid UTF-8

[23:19:53] <teut> except POST
[23:20:00] <teut> but what does that mean?
[23:21:48] <teut> if you make an update  user's name through post, it would change the user 's name in the db
[23:22:08] <GeDaMo> It means if you send the same request twice, it has the same result as if you'd only sent it once

[23:22:41] <teut> something with *

[23:38:29] <teut> yes since websites make request for fonts, css etc that is gonna happen
[23:38:34] <deniska> teut: it's the other way around, you want a user to be able to do something, then you consider whether an action can be considered or made idempotent, and then depending on that you choose PUT or POST method
[23:39:47] <teut> site A can't get cookies for site B, but it can trigger an action on site B on your behalf   <---  couldnt understand how csrf will help here

[23:50:30] <teut> so if I put a form for update lets say a user's image in his profile, and that will send a base64 encoded string to the server and that should get replaced in the db
[23:50:53] <teut> i know base64 is a bad idea but anyways
[23:50:56] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[23:50:58] <deniska> teut: yeah, replacing an image twice leaves the system in the same state, with a new image user wanted
[23:51:13] <teut> how is that a same state?
[23:51:22] <teut> initially you had image 1 in db
[23:51:33] <teut> now you got image 2 aften the put req
[23:51:52] <teut> and you changed "partial data"
[23:52:21] <deniska> teut: no, I mean that if a user accidentally updates an image twice, the end result is the same as updating it once
[23:52:31] <deniska> a user still got a new image they wanted
[23:53:01] <teut> so that means if they clicked the submit button 4 times kind of
[23:53:17] <deniska> yeah, they still got an image they wanted to be there
[23:53:45] <teut> but they can attach img 2 and make a request , then after 1 min may update it with img 3
[23:53:57] <teut> update it again *
[23:53:59] <deniska> sure, maybe they decided they don't like image 2
[23:54:08] <deniska> and made a different request with image 3
[23:54:21] <teut> a different request , hmm
[23:54:34] <deniska> what I'm saying, is that you shouldn't safeguard against the same image repeating twice
