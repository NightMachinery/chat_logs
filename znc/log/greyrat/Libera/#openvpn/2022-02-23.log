[03:42:49] <rob0> BtbN: 1. don't know yet; 2. yes, probably soon; 3. see #1.
[03:45:36] <BtbN> But will 3 replace 2, or will 2.6 still come out?
[03:45:52] <BtbN> ah, now I understand what you're saying :D
[03:46:04] <rob0> 2.6 is well underway
[03:46:33] <rob0> I don't think it has been decided what will follow
[03:47:06] <rob0> and of course at this point, "openvpn3" is only a client
[03:48:05] <BtbN> ah, that stops my plans anyway
[03:48:11] <BtbN> wanted to test server performance with the dco
[03:48:57] <rob0> 2.6 will have dco
[03:49:32] <rob0> in fact you can have it now from git
[03:55:44] <BtbN> Does it just work out of the box? I don't see a configure option for it.
[03:56:13] <rob0> oh, autoconf I bet
[03:56:31] <rob0> tbh I have never done that with openvpn, and rarely with anything :)
[03:57:07] <rob0> isn't there a readme or something?
[03:58:23] <BtbN> I grepped the whole git repo, and I find traces of dco support, but nothing concrete
[03:59:05] <BtbN> Oh, it seems to be a whole separate branch https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/tree/dco

The only errror I get is 'Failed' and if I try the same configuration with OpenVPN, I ge the error 'Authentication Failed' which really shouldn't be happening because everyone else i
