[00:00:10] <zicada> im not sure which is more user friendly for a beginner now, i would have said python before
[00:00:14] <Parf> but i can still use the programs themselves, oftentimes, without any experience
[00:00:15] <zicada> now im thinking js is catching up a lot
[00:00:18] <zicada> in variuous ways
[00:00:47] <Parf> https://imgur.com/user/Plesmorade check out some of this art though sometime
[00:00:47] <ro-bot-o> [url] Imgur: The magic of the Internet | imgur.com
[00:00:53] <Parf> it's crazy what you can yell at these robots nowadays
[00:01:08] <zicada> if you dont know either python or js, i think js is a pretty clear option, because you get to use it so easily in all the other fancy new shit happening
[00:01:30] <Parf> i'm surprised to hear that, i've always heard python as the suggested one
[00:02:10] *** Quits: arryana (~arryana@host86-131-122-62.range86-131.btcentralplus.com) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[00:02:15] <zicada> because of the web, theres a giant userbase of js, and the most work goes into js both as a language and compiler/interpreter
[00:02:36] <Parf> hum
[00:02:44] <zicada> if you learn that, you can arguably do more things easily than python, because python is not as popular with web in general, its django
[00:02:47] <zicada> and thats about it
[00:03:00] <zicada> django is good, dont get me wrong, ive used it a fair bit
[00:03:05] <Parf> just to clarify you're talking about javascript, right
[00:03:26] <zicada> but js is where "everyone" focuses now. Most backends are going from Java and PHP to JS too
[00:03:29] <Parf> well, anyway, it's unnerving to hear you say that, again, considering that most of the systems i'd be interested in using all use pytorch or some approximation of that
[00:03:38] <zicada> so fullstack js is gonna be a thing
[00:03:49] <kaine2> it's already very much a thing i believe
[00:04:01] <Parf> besides, i doubt i'll ever go into learning a language other than english. i'll just wait for the computers to catch up to my use of it
[00:04:07] <zicada> a big parf of that js move is ts: Typescript
[00:04:12] <zicada> it helps so much
[00:04:33] <zicada> its like java but much much nicer. Modern and clean
[00:04:34] <Parf> well, in any case, i see which side of the field you fall on!
[00:05:52] <zicada> my hope was to create some nuance
[00:06:03] <Parf> oh, there's far too much of that already
[00:06:18] <Parf> i remember when i first got into linux. talk about model airplanes!
[00:06:23] <zicada> depends which country if you ask me
[00:06:29] <kaine2> typescript interfaces sure are neat
[00:06:45] <zicada> i couldnt say theres enough nuance in US politics with a straight face
[00:06:48] <kaine2> it's the one thing rust doesn't have rn
[00:07:08] <Parf> yeah, i get my politics fix every month watching the full series of Yes, Minister
[00:07:19] <zicada> hah!
[00:09:17] <Parf> have you heard of lojban though
[00:09:29] <Parf> seems like something you'd be into

[00:12:40] <zicada> back
[00:13:09] <zicada> not something im into :)
[00:13:24] <Parf> ah
[00:13:35] <zicada> Esparanto on the other hand is a graph on what girlfrinds have though
[00:13:38] <zicada> to be honest
[00:13:57] <Parf> on what girlfriends have?
[00:14:06] <zicada> no particular personal interest, its historyless to me, esparanto etc
[00:14:14] <Parf> ah
[00:14:14] <zicada> had a few that were into it
[00:14:23] <Parf> so you like the historical aspect then as well
[00:14:36] <zicada> of languages ? absolutely
[00:14:52] <zicada> thats a big part of why Latin is high on the list
[00:15:21] <zicada> to be able to read historical 2000 year old latin documents
[00:15:30] <zicada> and understand italians and romanians, seems cool
[00:15:52] <zicada> souhnds enticing
[00:16:17] <Parf> yeah, that was always my interest in latin, but the interest in something like lojban seems to be "more", somehow, more of a utility language that allows one to think in a different way entirely, which seems convenient, considering how words and symbols are chains, and all
[00:16:38] <riv> do you know philosophy of probability?
[00:16:48] <Parf> do i?
[00:16:51] <riv> anyone
[00:17:08] <Parf> i mean, i know what philosophy and probability are vaguely
[00:17:11] <riv> are there any thought experiments that can distinguish between frequentist and bayesian
[00:17:18] <zicada> sure, but we cant get people to learn those in large enough quantities, they become elitist
[00:17:28] <zicada> only something intellectuals are into
[00:17:58] <Parf> yeah, elitism is a dangerous game, especially if you want "friends" or whatever they call those these days
[00:18:02] <zicada> if we mandated latin edu in schools
[00:18:14] <Parf> we'd have to fire a lot of teachers
[00:18:35] <zicada> then its no longer a rightwing intellectual thing, like translating the Bible to German in the 1550s
[00:18:38] <Parf> not that that'd be a bad thing
[00:19:11] <Parf> ah i see what you're saying now
[00:19:35] <zicada> hehe yeah, we need to up the limits on what grades pros√•ectove teachers can have
[00:19:40] <zicada> it used to be 2/6 in math here
[00:19:50] <zicada> now its 4/6 and tons of complaints
[00:19:52] <zicada> lils
[00:19:56] <zicada> worth it
[00:20:04] <Parf> prosaectove. prosaic...
[00:20:10] <Parf> what's prosaectove mean
[00:20:15] <zicada> prospective
[00:20:17] <zicada> sorry
[00:20:18] <Parf> oh derp
[00:20:28] <zicada> to be teachers
[00:20:33] <zicada> teachers in training
[00:20:42] <Parf> well, teachers unions make that difficult in this country
[00:21:14] <zicada> here its no longer up to them. Usually a loss for "My side"
[00:21:20] <zicada> but in that case i agree
[00:21:53] <Parf> frankly, it's all a scam these days in this country, capitalism, left run rampant, has immoderately adjusted our entire moral and ethics systems into a skewed vision of things, so subtly that even the most socialistic, communistic idealists are undermined by it
[00:21:57] <zicada> if i had my way we'd replace norwegian meth edu with the Russian system, their kids are on average 20% better
[00:22:09] <zicada> the secret is they teach them as intelligent adults
[00:22:13] <zicada> not dumb idiot kids
[00:22:14] <Parf> every problem can easily be run up to "oh someone got too greedy and too lazy to fix that"
[00:22:34] <Parf> agreed
[00:22:40] <zicada> they teach the full theory from the start and trust the kids to get it, the result is 20% better perf on average
[00:22:42] <Parf> monkey see monkey do
[00:22:44] <zicada> :)
[00:22:45] <zicada> yeah
[00:22:49] <Parf> you keep treating them like idiots it's all they know
[00:22:59] <zicada> its a general philosophy on how to treat kids
[00:23:00] <Parf> i talk to kids like adults as well, fuck that goo goo ga ga shit
[00:23:15] <Parf> they seem to prefer it, too. you instantly transform into the "cool uncle" usually
[00:23:44] <zicada> Parf: if you were a kid in the 80s you remember beiung out unsupervised most of the time right. Kids these days even here, have parents knowing their every move
[00:23:44] <Parf> despite it being a pretty common thought, in practice, it's wanting on a broad scale
[00:23:52] <zicada> i doubt thats healty for the parents or the kid
[00:24:01] <Parf> i was a kid in the early 90s, actually
[00:24:09] <zicada> close enough,
[00:24:12] <Parf> born 89, but yeah i got to do whatever, in the middle of the city
[00:24:25] <zicada> something has changed there for sure
[00:24:54] <zicada> we're maybe biased in that we assume others would benefit, but if the alernative is dark room alone..
[00:25:05] <zicada> for a growing brain
[00:25:22] <Parf> well it might be a necessary change. i think we must become accustomed to the fact that "hardened men" are not always necessary anymore, sure, there are forces on this planet that might suggest otherwise, but those are other already well hardened men themselves, usually. the very few occasions, we might save an island or something full of lord of the flies
[00:25:38] <zicada> Parf: absolutely
[00:25:39] <Parf> one thing i think a lot of kids don't have that i treasure retrospectively
[00:25:45] <Parf> is solitude, quiet
[00:26:09] <Parf> time to feel myself out, to entertain and delight myself. boredom never troubled me, and i think learning to know myself alone was part of that.
[00:26:09] <zicada> we've already been down this path for a while in Scandinavia, i hate to sound smug
[00:26:17] <zicada> its fine, its safe
[00:26:33] <zicada> women dont necessarily get easier to deal with as a man, though, sad to say
[00:26:46] <zicada> but they seem happier in general
[00:26:51] <Parf> well, in certain more barbaric lands, there is the appeal to inevitable violence at every step, and usually the violence is self-propagating, so it all just revolts and revolts further
[00:27:00] <Parf> well who needs women anyway
[00:27:18] <zicada> hehe yeah, its self-evident that we do
[00:27:27] <Parf> i mean we barely need men for their sperm or women for their wombs in the end, hop skip and a jump
[00:27:33] <zicada> i think women are great, i prefer them as doctors etc
[00:27:35] <Parf> brave new world, you remember it
[00:27:55] <zicada> yea aldous huxley ?
[00:27:57] <Parf> i think the whole human form is a bit, well, lacking, but i take what i can get
[00:28:16] <zicada> the human form isnt complete
[00:28:16] <Parf> i prefer if we had a few fewer orifices and more leathery skin
[00:28:19] <zicada> its always in beta
[00:28:22] <Parf> well yours isn't!
[00:28:28] * Parf is a callipygian superman
[00:28:54] <zicada> i know thats like sweaing in church
[00:29:05] <zicada> swearing
[00:29:06] <Parf> it means finely sculpted posterior
[00:29:13] <zicada> dat ass
[00:29:15] <Parf> yes
[00:29:42] <zicada> will humanity ever be "finished" ?
[00:29:43] <Parf> anyway, my point is that i was the final human version, and thus the best. Heterogenesis. the mulatto, product of black and white miscegenation
[00:30:08] <zicada> do evolving lifeforms have an endpoint, i guess
[00:30:10] <Parf> it's the "end" of humanity, as far as i'm concerned, the two apexes and their, not heterogenesis
[00:30:21] <Parf> heterosis, rather
[00:30:34] <zicada> luls
[00:30:36] <Parf> yes, i'd say so, if they seize the means of evolution, zicada
[00:30:50] <Parf> we're at the precipice of usurping the communism regime of nature itself, you know
[00:31:06] <zicada> i'd argue medicine is seizing the means of evolution
[00:31:15] <Parf> the writing is genuinely on the walls, designing DNA, protein structures have been SEQUENCED
[00:31:27] <zicada> its a big middle finger in the face of natural
[00:31:37] <Parf> well, we're still natural, aren't we?
[00:31:46] <Parf> i mean i have a give and take with that term as a concept
[00:31:49] <zicada> everything we do and make is too, then
[00:31:58] <Parf> i'd agree with that
[00:32:00] <zicada> incling materials that never existed on earth
[00:32:04] <zicada> and our making them
[00:32:07] <Parf> also those, yeah
[00:32:13] <Inline> DNA is not the end of the story
[00:32:21] <zicada> but then the word natural gets very loose
[00:32:27] <zicada> it hardly means anything anymore
[00:32:33] <zicada> great for merchandising
[00:32:37] <zicada> ....
[00:32:45] <Parf> didja know that in the formation of memories, our neurons break dna?
[00:32:59] <zicada> and so it went from a nice leftist activism thing to a rightwing make money off the bleeding heart idiots thing

[00:33:05] <ro-bot-o> [url] Memory-making involves extensive DNA breaking | MIT News | Massachusetts Institute of Technology | news.mit.edu
[00:33:10] <Inline> they have experiments done on living matter with charges and EM fields and the outcomes are different than what the DNA would code alone
[00:33:12] <Parf> pretty cool shit
[00:33:28] <zicada>  yea
[00:33:30] <Inline> so DNA is not the end all be all of that story
[00:33:36] <Parf> i mean, dna isn't end all be all, but it's a good system as far as i can tell
[00:33:50] <zicada> you can break it to generate experiences even possibly
[00:33:54] <Parf> soon we'll have completely new synthetic dna, it'll be nice
[00:34:09] <Parf> yeah i've definitely read my dna a few times, and the records within my flesh
[00:34:18] <Parf> that were passed down to me through my parents and theirs, etc
[00:34:20] <zicada> wonder how this relates to neurotransmitters etc
[00:34:27] <DPA> I want a prehensile tail. It's not fair that all other mamals got a tail, but humans just don't have one anymore...

[00:34:55] <zicada> Parf: full scans arent that expensive now, then you get a dataset you can upload to various services
[00:35:08] <Parf> actually, yeah, they have some cool infra red photonic systems now
[00:35:08] <zicada> and get more detailed stuff, based on the same data as 23andme etc
[00:35:11] <Inline> i.e. you have certain impositions on living matter from earths own environment coding it too, DNA alone is not the explanation
[00:35:36] <Inline> that's why you'd have different forms in different eras on earth too maybe
[00:35:44] <Parf> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0896627320307674 this in particular is an incredible breakthrough that didn't get much attention

[00:35:59] <zicada> Parf: hehe the "forgot" thing though, very similar to lots of simlar ideas about humans before us having all these secrets
[00:36:44] <zicada> Parf: its unlikely it can have been that amazing, given the apaprent tech level at the time.
[00:36:53] <Parf> i mean within, not without
[00:37:04] <zicada> mystical people before the ice age etc have no proof in reality, but a lot of people are drawn to that idea of secret past
[00:37:06] <Parf> if we have the "tech" within, what tech without would we need, besides?
[00:37:28] <zicada> the titles of documentaries etc are always "hidden", "lost" "ancient" "secret" etc
[00:37:31] <Parf> my point is, that we're flying in insane cosmic spaceships, and we've forgotten the controls to communicate with our flesh itself
[00:37:43] <Parf> yeah, because they are the giants who developed the thoughts we have to this day
[00:37:55] <zicada> we dont have the tech within
[00:37:58] <Parf> they were the pattern seekers, the apophenic hermits, the vigils against the eternal darkness
[00:37:59] <Parf> bullshit
[00:38:00] <zicada> we develop the tech over time
[00:38:07] <Parf> we're running tech as we speak, dna IS TECH
[00:38:18] <Parf> i can't imagine what the hell else you'd call it
[00:38:25] <zicada> but, if you took a kid from 2000 years ago and swapped him with a kid from today, nobody would notice
[00:38:28] <zicada> its all about education
[00:38:59] <zicada> its about remembering everything forefathers did and working to improve on it, in a structured way
[00:39:10] <zicada> obviously writing was a super big one
[00:39:27] <Parf> i think writing has been a bane on the soul of man since graven images were first developed
[00:39:28] <zicada> before that it was just dad telling his son(s) stuff before dying and hoping theyd rememebr and tell their kids
[00:39:52] <Parf> it is the lowest of experience, the symbolic tie to this world
[00:39:54] <zicada> Parf: change isnt bane
[00:39:57] <Parf> to you
[00:39:59] <zicada> change is the bane of the old
[00:40:01] <zicada> :)
[00:40:17] <Parf> besides, it's not simply change, but imprisonment
[00:40:23] <zicada> you cant be against change AND understand history at the same time
[00:40:28] <zicada> history is about change overtime
[00:40:35] <Parf> history is a repetitive process
[00:40:39] <Parf> the sun goes up, sun goes down
[00:40:42] <Parf> nothing new under it
[00:40:43] <zicada> its a progressive process
[00:40:51] <Parf> it's all the same shit over and over again
[00:40:57] <zicada> less violence and suffering per person
[00:40:59] <zicada> over time
[00:41:00] <zicada> on avg
[00:41:02] <Parf> you'd think that
[00:41:07] <zicada> data says that
[00:41:09] <zicada> so i think that
[00:41:14] <Parf> what data
[00:41:42] <zicada> Parf: for a good comprehensive summary, look into Stephen Pinker - The better angels of our nature
[00:41:52] <zicada> graphs and everything
[00:41:59] <Parf> i'm familiar with pinker
[00:42:46] <zicada> he shows in an objective way how technoglogy and progress reduces suffering and poverty and hunger and violence and so on
[00:43:03] <zicada> starting in the stone ages
[00:43:37] <zicada> the differnce between 1991 and 2021 is insane
[00:43:51] <zicada> in terms of total amt of humans below the poverty line, or in hunger etc
[00:44:12] <zicada> but positive news is rarely mentioned on TV, especially now slow positive news like this
[00:44:19] <zicada> *not
[00:44:31] <Parf> needless to say, i think we have an imposition on these matters, words, to me, symbols in their entirety, are chains. it has nothing to do in essence, to me, about the progress of humanity in technological advancements. as far as i'm concerned, these were all integrations that came after the imprisonment had occurred to begin with, and thus are within only the purview of the post-imprisoned man

[00:53:37] <Parf> it'll be nice when science converges just a little more, and you can finally see what i mean about the symbols
[00:53:40] <zicada> i think class is the least shitty way to deal with inequality
[00:53:46] <Parf> when they're gone again, you'll see how much more room you have
[00:53:48] <zicada> much better than skincolor etc

[00:55:54] <riv> want to know about probabililty philosophpy
[00:56:05] <riv> why should we be thinking frequentist vs bayesian
[00:56:09] <zicada> i already know a fair amt
[00:56:21] <riv> i.e. does P(x) mean how many times itll happen, or level of belief
[00:56:22] <zicada> i try to think bayesean when i get the chance
[00:56:28] <riv> > chance
[00:56:29] <riv> lmao
[00:56:38] <zicada> when i get to think slowly instead of quickly
[00:56:40] <zicada> hehe
[00:56:52] <zicada> i think you know what i mean
[00:57:26] <zicada> point is assumptions are optimized to be very low cost for the brain
[00:57:46] <zicada> we make them all the time without.... thinking
[00:57:51] <riv> that's true
