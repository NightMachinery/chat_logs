If I check the literal for itself it works, if I check the date for itself, it works, if I combine both into a group (line 8), it does not work. Any suggestion?

[02:13:44] <Soni> what is a buffer interface?
[02:14:24] <cluelessperson> question, should I design my class to accept a parent_logger? and have the class make its own child logger?   or should I have it accept a logger directly to use?
[02:15:13] *** Quits: palasso (~palasso@user/palasso) (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:15:15] <cluelessperson> Soni, an interface typically determines *how* you use an object.   So a buffer's interface would probably be the methods that wrap an object that you'd use to access and modify it.
[02:15:49] *** Joins: djapo (~archangel@user/djapo)
[02:16:39] <cluelessperson> Soni, oftentimes, you'll find libraries will have similar or interchangeable objects, purposely designed to take the same arguments and do the same things, even if they operate with different implementations in the background.
[02:16:55] <Soni> https://www.pygit2.org/objects.html#pygit2.Blob
[02:17:30] <cluelessperson> Soni,   for example, many databases might be interchangeable,  and a library might interact with each database technically differently, but offer a "common interface"

[03:52:03] <bjs> cluelessperson: duplicated lines are a common symptom of adding multiple handlers to the logger

[07:14:12] <saltrocklamp[m]> one for each city is different
[07:14:13] <white_magic> In that example, they're using stock data. The price/ticker information is a time series.
[07:14:28] <saltrocklamp[m]> yes, a multi-index can help
[07:14:51] <Omega037> Why do you want this in a dataframe?
[07:14:55] *** Joins: MercilessDeth (~brad@136.49.61.2)
[07:15:00] <white_magic> saltrocklamp[m] Essentially, I would like to be able to slice and dice data of the nature that I described VERY quickly and effectively. I don't have to.. I can just use Python .. but of course, Numpy and Pandas are built for this
[07:15:07] <Omega037> Why not just have multiple dataframes or another object type
[07:15:28] <Omega037> Pandas is built for mostly flat, tabular data
[07:15:37] <saltrocklamp[m]> pandas can definitely handle this
[07:15:42] <saltrocklamp[m]> let me look up the right incantation
[07:15:59] <Omega037> Can vs Should is a question that should be asked sometimes
[07:15:59] <white_magic> Omega037: to be able to make complex queries like (forgive my pseudo syntax): Give me the names of cities which had temperatures in the range of x to y degrees in the period of July 15 2021 to August 15 2021
[07:16:06] <jinsun> one really simple way can be to just add each date as a column, then you don't even need multi index
[07:16:16] <saltrocklamp[m]> Omega037: multi-indexes are one of the key features of pandas
[07:16:20] <white_magic> Omega037: again, my goal is to do this in pandas because it's fast as heck

[07:16:54] <white_magic> jinsun: that is certainly one option though it *seems* like the wrong solution
[07:17:30] <Omega037> This sorta sounds like something we do sometimes
[07:17:37] <saltrocklamp[m]> white_magic: assuming `df1` has an index called `city_name` and `df2` has a multi-index with names `date` and `city_name`, you can do `df1.join(df2, on=['city_name'])`
[07:17:43] <saltrocklamp[m]> https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.join.html

[07:18:57] <saltrocklamp[m]> this _is_ the correct solution Omega037

[07:19:32] <Omega037> saltrocklamp[m], I'll be honest but I consider multiindex to be a hack
[07:19:45] <Omega037> And if you are using it, you are probably using the wrong tool
[07:20:15] <Omega037> pandas is great, but it also has a lot of crap tacked on as people try to use it as a universal tool

[07:21:35] <jinsun> multiindex is just more than one header or index for the data, sometimes that is what you really need, notihng hacky or wrong about it
[07:21:39] <Omega037> Sure, but that argument could be used for anything
[07:22:01] <Omega037> I'll just leave this here: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/e2717124aab1eea4f39ead15553ac3781b878adc/pandas/io/json/_normalize.py#L433

If you take a look at this sample data: https://i.imgur.com/D4dgJxg.jpeg (not mine, this is just from a tutorial), how can I make it so that the stock names appear on the left? In my case, I have the dates and prices (the equivalent of those in my dataset) as values in a
[07:52:45] <white_magic> dictionary, where the keys are stock names (or city names, in my the case of my data). How could I create something like what's in that screenshot? Relatedly, I'm nearly finished with my hello world example of this - what's the pastebin that is preferred here?

[11:17:40] <hexnewbie> Not having unit tests really complicated porting to Python 3, too. Albeit, it was not walk in the park even *with* them, and depending on the time available, for some code, writing them would have taken the same or more time. Although if you have code that you need to write code to test (e.g. a library), stuffing that code in a unit test gives you a free unit test. Yay, victory.

You can't do something custom like that with numpy, it is for math, not for working with files, but it already *does* do exactly that to parse your matrix from the file

[13:26:38] <jonascj> In introducing programming to novices i often find myself wanting a list of coordinates. It could be a list of coordinates for the aliens in an space invaders clone. (part 2 follows in a moment)
[13:28:06] *** Joins: EvilDMP (~textual@django/moderator/EvilDMP)
[13:28:12] <jonascj> A list of tuples 'aliens = [(0,50), (0,100), (0,150)]' serves the purpose, except when updating only one coordinates (the aliens move in only  one direction) you have to craete new tuples (because tuples are immutable).

[13:31:08] <jonascj> Is there an alternative? A list of lists feel wrong since the inner lists will always have length 2 (x and y coordinate). Down the road a class will of course be representing the aliens, but to avoid classes for a few hours, what to do?

[13:32:36] <supakeen> I'd say a list of lists is fine; but so are tuples.
[13:32:53] <oprypin> jonascj, mm that's always a gory topic. i'd suggest  xs = [0,0,0], ys = [50, 100, 150]
[13:33:41] <jinsun> list of 2 items is fine, otherwise a dict with x and y as keys maybe

[13:36:38] <ham5urg> I try to get into pyparsing, but some mistake holds me back. http://paste.debian.net/1211221/ line 9 creates the parser, line 14 is the actual parsing. My problem is that pyparsing.Keyword is overconsuming the input (csv, line 11). The error is: Expected " ", found '0'  (at char 14), (line:1, col:15) How to invoke pyparsing correctly?
[13:36:51] <jonascj> lists of lists are great, it just feels better if you leverage the fact they are lists (i.e. they grow in length etc.). Using a lists as a mutable tuple is not as pretty as could be.
[13:37:00] <jonascj> ^bjs
[13:37:21] <bjs> jonascj: I think it's a bit misguided trying to make beautiful and pretty code when teaching novices
[13:37:47] <jinsun> the pretty thing will be to make a Point dataclass, but you don't want to go into that probably at this stage
[13:38:30] <bjs> jonascj: it will all seem alien to novices and they're very unlikely to see the difference between [(1,2), (3,4)] and [[1,2], [3,4]] in the deep and insightful way about mutability that you do
[13:38:31] <jonascj> some would dive straight into a data class which is after all pretty simple, and in terms of new concepts not more mysterious than a named tuple

[15:04:06] <ApostleInTriumph> Hello. i've two numpy arrays. one is of size (3,) called A and other is of size (10000,3) called D. My goal is to select two points B,C from the latter (of size (2,3)), such that area formed by the triangle ABC is the largest. How do I go about?

[17:02:54] <Soni> bjs: let's say a dst link points to ../foo/bar and the src link points to ../bar/baz, cp -R -P guarantees dst link will point to ../bar/baz after it runs but shutil.copytree apparently keeps it

[17:48:00] <saltrocklamp[m]> Omega037: i had to leave last night so i couldn't rebut what you said :P but i don't think a multiindex is any more of a hack than a composite primary key. you might argue that having the index separate from the data is a hack, but it's better to see it as a deliberate deviation from the relational model. R for example has had row and column names for decades, but the R community has specifically _eschewed_ using row labels in this
[17:48:00] <saltrocklamp[m]> fashion, and e.g. data.table lets you assign a column within the table as an "index" - but it's not the same thing and it's arguably a more limited model. there are pros and cons to both ways of doing things, but it's absolutely not a "hack".
[17:48:52] <Soni> that aside, it works. altho we had the weirdest segfault just now.
[17:49:06] <grym> Omega037: re:inplace, it's just a question of how much you lean into mutation, but it's such a tangled mess in pandas anyway that it's really no difference i think

[19:29:34] <ApostleInTriumph> Hello. What is an optimal way of finding a point (3D) from given set (np.array) which is farthest from two given point (line)?
[19:29:59] *** Joins: legola (~legola@46.235.100.27)
[19:30:43] <ApostleInTriumph> Repiphany the solution you proposed earlier worked for 3D. but for higher dimension there is no cross product as there exists no unique vector which is orthogonal to a given set of vectors. that's why I'm looking for an alternative. this time, a solution is still okay if it's not the most optimal

[20:58:44] <p-i-> Suppose your points are in 3 galaxies. You can bound each galaxy by a sphere. So you'd be only looking for one point in each galaxy. Finding an efficient solution is a very interesting problem. For every point you could compute the distance to the furthest neighbour. That might allow you to discard certain points. All you have to do is find a big triangle, and you could probably show that 90% of the points couldn't contribute to such a big triangle

[22:17:22] <sveinse> setuptools.find_packages() is finnicky! Tweaked other options to and and it is happier

[22:20:00] <ross> bjs: yes, I think this is where my misunderstanding came from - intuitively I would expect that to have to be declared by having Bike also extend ABC
[22:20:11] <ross> but as SkyLeach says, it's not a language feature, so no dice

[23:34:06] <sveinse> altendky: yeah, I'm trying to follow that thread of ensuring pyinstaller picks it up. I think it might have to do with the way this pyside2reactor injects itself. It simply installs itself into the twisted.plugins dir
[23:34:07] <pycurious> Does ProcessPoolExecutor support recursion? It seems to me its not executing when i do that.

[23:52:18] <sveinse> altendky: for fun I tried the qt5reactor repo. That turns out to not install the twisted/plugins/qt5.py, neither in pip or in git master...

[23:54:56] <altendky> sveinse: if you don't import it then pyinstaller often doesn't figure it out.  i've got my own funky or whatever way to build the list, but sveinse: if you don't import it then pyinstaller often doesn't figure it out.  i've got my own
[23:55:30] <sveinse> altendky: I know, but I'm looking at this long before pyinstaller now. There is something else fishy here in the ordinary py world
