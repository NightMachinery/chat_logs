[17:31:16] <AryaK[m]> but the thing is he isnt a moderator
[17:31:23] <AryaK[m]> so it shouldnt work for him
[17:33:07] <labrador> AryaK[m], I think he was just experimenting. He couldn't have done anything anyway. The best idea would be to drop any threats while just asking his reason. Descalation y'know
[17:33:09] <NeoVoid[m]> AryaK[m]: yep it shouldnt and yet somehow appservice bot got triggered and decide to obey his command. 
[17:33:09] <NeoVoid[m]> what a coincidence.
[17:33:45] <gtlsgamr> labrador: I think I missed soemthing
[17:33:46] <labrador> .help
[17:33:47] <gtlsgamr> what is happening
[17:34:08] <AryaK[m]> appservice clears up users if they havent talked for x amount oftime
[17:34:13] <NeoVoid[m]> @just_saumit bruh
[17:34:13] <NeoVoid[m]> why you did it?
[17:34:13] <NeoVoid[m]> explain yourself.
[17:34:13] <gtlsgamr> what is appservice
[17:34:23] <labrador> gtlsgamr, nothing really except Zbnssn[m] did a quit command tagged for telegram bridge and apparently it actually quit
[17:34:27] <gtlsgamr> also why cant I see just_saumit
[17:34:31] <AryaK[m]> its the bridge gtlsgamr 
[17:34:33] <labrador> Even tho Zbnssn[m] didn't have the perms to do it
[17:34:44] <AryaK[m]> it didnt obey
[17:34:47] <AryaK[m]> it was working then
[17:34:50] <labrador> Now AryaK[m] says it was just a coincidence
[17:34:57] <AryaK[m]> the issue was that tg bridge hasnt spoken
[17:34:58] <gtlsgamr> ah
[17:34:59] <labrador> And it actually died cuz inactive
[17:35:00] <AryaK[m]> in a long time
[17:35:03] <labrador> yeh
[17:35:08] <NeoVoid[m]> AryaK[m]: bruh. 
[17:35:08] <NeoVoid[m]> Matrix bot does the talking all the time.
[17:35:11] <AryaK[m]> so it died coz appservice kicks inactive users
[17:35:21] <gtlsgamr> just kill it already 
[17:35:22] <labrador> NeoVoid[m], nah it actually didn't for quite a while...
[17:35:24] <labrador> It was silent
[17:35:25] <gtlsgamr> most of us are on matrix anyway
[17:35:31] <AryaK[m]> Matrix Telegram Bridge: is quiet
[17:35:47] <labrador> gtlsgamr, and would also keeps noobs from infiltrating this community :p
[17:35:54] <AryaK[m]> Neo Void: and Matrix Telegram Bridge are different entities
[17:35:58] <gtlsgamr> yep.
[17:35:59] <NeoVoid[m]> how it could be inactive when it continuously transfers the msg between clients.
[17:36:15] <AryaK[m]> appservice isnt very intelligenjt
[17:36:20] <labrador> lol
[17:36:24] <AryaK[m]> it just counts messages the bot has sent
[17:36:32] <AryaK[m]> if it hasnt sent any in x time
[17:36:35] <AryaK[m]> it kicks the person
[17:36:42] <AryaK[m]> i forgot how long it was tho
[17:37:17] <NeoVoid[m]> labrador: or it responds late to commands sometimes.
[17:37:18] <labrador> but i think AryaK[m] a bot with good design would rejoin and become operable again to auto-fix it...did it do that?
[17:37:55] <gtlsgamr> AryaK[m]: NeoVoid[m]: as admins.. do you think we should kill telegram bridge? Matrix and IRC are fine on their own at this point. The quality of new joinees has been shit lately. 
[17:38:01] <AryaK[m]> maybe telegram bridge didnt expect to be bridged with irc
[17:38:11] <NeoVoid[m]> labrador: bruh. where you getting this from and why you are taking this convo to whatever you intend to take it.
[17:38:37] <labrador> NeoVoid[m], i am not taking it anywhere....i was merely asking a question ;__;
[17:38:38] <labrador> sorry
[17:38:59] <AryaK[m]> gtlsgamr: i am kinda neutral. Yes new joinees have become mostly trolls but... there are a lot of cool people who havent migrated yet
[17:39:14] <AryaK[m]> and some who use both but are very active ontelegram like Drishal 
[17:39:53] <AryaK[m]> also how did we loose 50+ members
[17:40:02] <AryaK[m]> now the room is close to 153 members
[17:40:38] <AryaK[m]> also Neo Void how active is the old linuxindia room?
[17:40:47] <NeoVoid[m]> gtlsgamr: No. some of the members are still on telegram and due to infancy and inconvency of irc and matrix they are still hesitant to come.
[17:41:04] <gtlsgamr> Alright then. Up to you!
[17:41:47] <AryaK[m]> maybe we should limit new joins...
[17:41:53] <AryaK[m]> from telegram
[17:42:15] <gtlsgamr> let it be then
[17:42:17] <gtlsgamr> no need to limit it
[17:42:23] <NeoVoid[m]> AryaK[m]: gotta very active not as much as this one but still despite of continuously crypto spammers msgs they are still standing right.
[17:42:44] <NeoVoid[m]> * gotta say very active
[17:42:46] <AryaK[m]> nice
[17:42:58] <AryaK[m]> but still crypto spam?
[17:43:04] <AryaK[m]> haven they done anything about it?
[17:43:14] <AryaK[m]> also did spidyshivam finally give bugs owner
[17:43:57] <NeoVoid[m]> AryaK[m]: yes. they added some bot and it take care of the spams but i think with that speed it gonna take year to fully clean up the group.
[17:44:34] <AryaK[m]> AryaK[m]: this?
[17:45:15] <NeoVoid[m]> nope he still owner
[17:45:40] <AryaK[m]> oof

[18:57:47] <labrador> must be tyranny
[18:58:44] <gtlsgamr> I think he meant tyranny.
[18:58:54] <gtlsgamr> tranny would be.. well. a controversial opinion

[21:03:13] <gtlsgamr> since Jan 2021
[21:03:21] <gtlsgamr> full time
[21:03:34] <gtlsgamr> otherwise Jun 2020 i was dual bootign, getting to know it
[21:03:41] <Klisper[m]> bro my kernel has been compiling for like 2 hours now ðŸ’€
[21:03:46] <labrador> oh nice gtlsgamr I started in feb 2021 and also nuked my windows install(the first time) so I was in for a blind run
[21:04:04] <labrador> Klisper[m], do you modify your kernels?
[21:04:07] <gtlsgamr> Klisper[m]: gentooman?
[21:04:09] <labrador> Or use dracut?

[21:04:31] <Zbnssn[m]> Klisper[m]: I'm doing fine on arch... I dont get debian package manager such headache
[21:04:41] <gtlsgamr> i switched to arch
[21:04:49] <gtlsgamr> since then it has been quiet
[21:04:54] <gtlsgamr> been about a year
[21:04:54] <Zbnssn[m]> from artix?
[21:04:59] <Klisper[m]> i started in i think about like
[21:05:00] <Klisper[m]> 4 months ago

[21:05:20] <labrador> Yeah almost everyone here is new...cool

[21:05:40] <Klisper[m]> no gentoo is ez lol
[21:05:53] <Klisper[m]> just need to have patience and follow the wiki
[21:05:54] <Zbnssn[m]> still good for u if you use debian, I just don't think I can suffer using debian as daily driver
[21:06:15] <Klisper[m]> i even installed openrc gentoo on my laptop its that ez
[21:06:23] <labrador> Klisper[m], not really...I have a "directive" to not blindly run wiki commands
[21:06:26] <Zbnssn[m]> yeah I will do gentoo later already spent shitton of time tinkering my arch build
[21:06:31] <labrador> So understanding stuff takes too long for me
[21:06:40] <labrador> Its how you learn man
[21:06:44] <gtlsgamr> why distrohop anyway? if u comfy, then be comfy XD
[21:06:54] <Klisper[m]> u know u can still customize your kernel on any other distro?
[21:06:58] <labrador> gtlsgamr, my plan is to end up on guix.
[21:07:05] <Zbnssn[m]> Yeah I will never understand distrohopping
[21:07:08] <gtlsgamr> oof 
[21:07:08] <Klisper[m]> don't use guix
[21:07:10] <Klisper[m]> if u use guix ur pp fall
[21:07:14] <labrador> Basically debian --> arch --> gentoo --> guix
[21:07:16] <Zbnssn[m]> just use good wallpapers
[21:07:19] <labrador> Ultimate chad guix user
[21:07:32] <Klisper[m]> the only guix user is probably richard stallman
[21:07:38] <labrador> I like rms
[21:07:38] <Zbnssn[m]> lmaoo
[21:07:38] <Klisper[m]> and you don't want to end up like him
[21:07:43] <labrador> I love rms
[21:07:47] <gtlsgamr> is all a meme. computing is pointlses if all your time goes in tinkering
[21:07:48] <Zbnssn[m]> I love rms
[21:07:55] <gtlsgamr> get a stable system and b done with it
[21:07:57] <labrador> Thats why I came to irc
[21:08:06] <labrador> To get a place for #fsf talk
[21:08:16] <labrador> Instead of proprietary reddit
[21:08:21] <Zbnssn[m]> Though I personally wouldnt like to make love to his dead corpse
[21:08:23] <Klisper[m]> FSF is now a joke lol
[21:08:24] <labrador> I used it before irc
[21:08:33] <labrador> Klisper[m], no it isn't...
[21:08:42] <Zbnssn[m]> Zbnssn[m]: //he is ok with necrophilia
[21:08:43] <labrador> gtlsgamr, the point for me is to learn
[21:08:51] <Klisper[m]> didn't he have pedophile remarks or something
[21:09:04] <labrador> Right now I'm learning about DAC and MACs
[21:09:08] <labrador> Quite cool stuff
[21:09:29] <Zbnssn[m]> labrador: best subreddits and posts get taken down by mods
[21:09:58] <labrador> Zbnssn[m], most of reddit is bakchodi. Only a little is actually useful stuff
[21:10:18] <Zbnssn[m]> Klisper[m]: I mean I he's not a pedophile himself he's just saying stuff that isn't necessarily wrong... but is in poor taste to say
[21:10:27] <Klisper[m]> btw indiachan got taken down

[22:19:53] <Tor[m]> Buddhe ho rahe ho
[22:20:12] <labrador> Tor[m], he's at a completely different stage of life
