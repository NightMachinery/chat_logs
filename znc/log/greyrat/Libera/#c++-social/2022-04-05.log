[20:09:22] <MaNI> the culprit was libtool, I'm so surprised and shocked /s
[20:09:41] <MaNI> also this means I have no idea how to actually fix it, does anyone in the world actually understand libtool? IDK
[20:10:03] <MaNI> seems hacking around it is the done thing
[20:10:15] <Renderwww> write a fuzzer that just does random shit
[20:11:59] <Renderwww> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQ64sAPiW0 enter the sandman xylophone edition
[20:14:36] <Renderwww> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLxnIMgvDSw lol
[20:15:10] <markuskj> enter sandman didn't sound anything like the original so it was probably genuine jazz
[20:16:06] <MaNI> modifying the build system with fuzzing, genius, its basically what I end up doing manually anyway
[20:18:21] <Renderwww> it's called test driven development. Write some test for the output and then randomly change stuff until the test passes
[20:22:01] <markuskj> maybe create an ASIC to crunch through all the build options
[20:28:10] <Renderwww> I can't wait to upgrade my cmake coprocessor
