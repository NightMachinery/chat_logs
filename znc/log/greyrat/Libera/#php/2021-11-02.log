[00:47:51] <Sammitch> maybe. depends on apt and how php was packaged. YMMV
[00:49:08] <biberu> (if this was a vm or container you could just start a new environment with the desired configuration without trashing the old one)
[00:49:59] <Sammitch> eg: I've seen some PHP packages assume you're using mod_php and try to remove apache along with themselves. you might need to run whatever apt's equivalent of a transaction is to replace the packages in one go
[00:50:34] <Sammitch> I've also had python packages try to remove yum on centos :P
[00:51:06] <biberu> did they at least remove python too?
[00:51:42] <Sammitch> shockingly, yum refuses to remove itself

[01:39:57] <__adrian> did you install those extensions? did you install them via the same method (e.g., apt) that you installed php?
[01:42:45] <yin> yes
[01:43:13] <yin> if i comment the mysql_pdo and openssl lines in php.ini the error goes awayy
[01:43:29] <yin> other extensions are working fine
[01:44:09] <__adrian> did you modify your php.ini file(s) manually? if you comment out those lines, and the errors "go away," do the extensions work?
[01:47:56] <yin> yes
[01:48:58] <yin> wait
[01:49:09] <yin> let me check if the remaining extensions do work
[01:49:17] <__adrian> "yes" which part?  (a) you probably shouldn't be adding lines in your ini files; the package's install script would probably be doing that (b) if you comment out those lines and then it works, that would support the idea of (a)
[01:50:10] <__adrian> esp. for ubuntu, it's VERY unlikely you would need to manually add extension=... in your ini
[01:56:47] <ash_worksi> __adrian: you once told me you (I think on occasion) make a distinction between an ID associated with an entity in a database and an ID associated with an entity in an application; I think you called the database one an OID, is that right?

[01:58:39] <__adrian> db id vs. app id doessn't ring any bells
[01:59:33] <ash_worksi> mkay; it might've been someone else, but it was during the era of me asking about UUIDs vs serial ids.
[02:00:00] <__adrian> serial and uuids would both be examples of artificial keys
[02:00:57] <ash_worksi> And I think it was amongst the discussion where I was talking about "always valid entities" (an object constructed with an id) vs the argument that an entity is not really an entity until its stored somewhere
[02:01:23] <ash_worksi> I had this saved to a log on a thumb drive which I have since destroyed by writing to it too much

[02:02:01] <__adrian> couldn't say, but don't remember it specifically
[02:02:32] <ash_worksi> but the idea was something along the lines of, "yeah sure, you can have an id relating to object data in a DB, but that's for db purposes. The ID exposed to the rest of the world is called _____"
[02:02:37] <__adrian> also here you go  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dougISKs2vQ
[02:03:36] <__adrian> ok, so there is the idea that artificial keys _are_ very useful for code, and that natural keys are _much_ nicer for people to look at
[02:03:45] <ash_worksi> neat

When I run it using PDO I get "SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1205 Lock wait timeout exceeded; try restarting transaction" if i run the query on my sql IDE it runs fine(takes around 2-3 mins to finish) I think TinoD suggests breaking the sub query and run it "before", I didnt
[18:08:32] <freeman_h> query understand this, can someone elaborate please? https://kopy.io/SafNw P.S I did ask in #mysql and they said it seems like a php pdo issue has it does not lock when running it in the IDE

[19:10:41] <stenno> ah yes

[19:32:27] <stenno> in any case you should use array_key_exists because isset will be false if the value is null

[19:33:04] <stenno> of an object?
[19:33:31] <xsx> hm, ok, i think i got the point. so there is no has() method for any objects?

[21:20:56] <biberu> hans: are you using php for that?
[21:21:02] <hans> biberu, yeah
[21:21:27] <biberu> why not something with more efficient data structures, threading etc?

[21:46:33] <hans> how do you add pdo to php with "./configure --disable-all --enable-cli" ? because https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.installation.php just says "it's enabled by default"

[21:47:31] <__adrian> generally, via your package manager. there's usually no need to compile php yourself

[21:48:27] <hans> right, but i'm testing PHP8.2-dev (actually testing something that needs php8.1+), and i don't have a repo with 8.1rc or higher
