[12:34:54] <CyberShadow> If you need to just install a package ASAP, the safest thing to do is to try to install it from a mirror that still has a copy of the version from the point in time that the system was last updated
[12:35:06] <CyberShadow> That involves skipping over a lot of 404s
[12:35:54] <CyberShadow> Occasionally some mirrors disappear in such a way that pacman only notices that something is wrong after it downloaded the file, e.g., sites that have been taken over by domain squatters and serve HTTP 200 for any request
[12:36:49] <CyberShadow> I suppose I should just put the Arch Linux Archive as the second entry in the mirrorlist for this situation
[12:37:36] <mpan> CyberShadow: it seems like poorly maintained system with a partial upgrade to me…
[12:37:59] <CyberShadow> The goal is exactly to avoid partial upgrades.
[12:38:17] <mpan> While I can see a single mirror may be broken and give 404, how comes many of them yield 404?
[12:38:37] <CyberShadow> Because most (but not all) mirrors are quick to delete all but the latest copy of a package
[12:38:57] <Edu4rdSHL> It's rsync job really :p
[12:38:59] <mpan> And you are supposed to update your mirror list for it to contain valid mirrors. If for a week you see no updates, it’s a clear sign you should investigate.
[12:39:23] <CyberShadow> That's not related to the problem at hand at all
[12:39:29] <mpan> CyberShadow: no, they only delete the outdated ones. Ones your system would never use if it’s not in a partial update state or outdated.
[12:40:17] <CyberShadow> Yes, I mentioned it's outdated.
[12:40:26] <mpan> Then update it.
[12:40:46] <mpan> Or use ALA, if you really need to, but that’s only asking for trouble if your goal is to do that on regular basis.
[12:40:47] <CyberShadow> That may not be the most appropriate thing to do at any given circumstance.

[13:31:41] <CyberShadow> HEX0: Thanks for the suggestion; I've been using rankmirrors (and just uncommenting everything, letting the order dictate the process); the slightly bigger problem is keeping it up to date automatically, and with the varying policies across machines (e.g. stationary PC vs. mobile laptop). Also trying to see if it's possible to integrate ALA in the way I described above.
[13:31:44] <rapiz> so, i guess there's not much progress
[13:32:36] <HEX0> CyberShadow: that's too much work. I forgot what your issue was. but if it's automatically sorting fastest and most up to date mirrors then reflector is to lazy automatic solution

[15:13:46] <tyawp> for example, `convert foo.jpg -split bar.jpg` reduces quality.
[15:13:58] <tyawp> maybe it's because ImageMagick...?
[15:14:32] <earnestly> I'm not sure what imagemagick has to do with metadata, but if you use convert like that you'll get the default -quality, which for jpeg I think is 90

[15:16:25] <earnestly> It's probably too niche of a thing
[15:16:53] <tyawp> It seems that ImageMagick internally maps a image to their format and converts it to a compressed JPG format with quality loss which is the cause of the problem.
[15:17:21] <grawity> use exiftool for metadata, then
[15:17:32] <tyawp> grawity, oh, I'll try it.
[15:17:57] <grawity> yeah since the primary purpose of `magick convert` is indeed to convert and mangle the image, it's not surprising at all

[16:45:31] <m67baby> what about performance, did you guys notice something vs lvm/ext4?
[16:45:45] <m67baby> sorry if I'm not being correct asking these questions!
[16:46:21] <Namarrgon> on spinning rust it has terrible latency
[16:46:42] <Namarrgon> otherwise it's fast enough that i don't notice it negatively in everyday use

[16:49:32] <m67baby> so, I'll give it a try then, maybe now I dont bother about snapshots but maybe in the future I do (?)
[16:49:40] <mingdao> Tom^: The end result of yesterday's monitors were the 2 Acer's had identical brightness, they were just both dim.  I have swapped one Acer for a Samsung, which has great brightness.  However, the Samsung only has VGA and 2 HDMI output, so I can't try frogging DVI (Acer) and HDMI (Samsung).
[16:49:40] <m67baby> thanks for your answers and opinions!
[16:49:45] <mingdao> Any idea how to brighten up the Acer?
[16:50:22] <Namarrgon> archbuild supports btrfs snapshots, creating a new chroot is a breeze!

[16:51:19] <mingdao> Tom^: How does one determine "max settings"?  There is the physical menu on the monitor, nvidia-settings, xrandr, etc.
[16:51:42] <jmcantrell> m67baby: you don't need to use them, but once you play around with them, you'll probably find that it's so easy, there's no reason not to
[16:51:45] <m67baby> should I update my kernel with care using btrfs or that was years ago?
[16:51:47] <Tom^> mingdao: if brightness is at max at the physical menu. thats as bright as it gets. all the nvidia-settings/xrandr can do is change colors

The problem occurs when I want to change or create the start menu items under Mate desktop but i have another strange problem.
[19:09:59] <NetSysFire> may be a bug in mate
[19:10:40] <NetSysFire> in my experience, corrupted caches or even configs can cause such coredumps, too. create a new user to try again in a fresh and clean environment. if it still happens, you found a bug
[19:10:59] <another|> from my 10min googling a few days ago, I concluded that PRO is likely better for some vulkan applications. It also provides openCL which I'm not sure amdgpu does

[19:21:11] <NetSysFire> Uranoxyd: strace can be your friend here
[19:21:22] <another|> I run neither
[19:21:35] <NetSysFire> Uranoxyd: that requires you to find out which specific application you need to strace
[19:21:52] <NetSysFire> there is a good chance the bar/menu stuff is something separate which will make debugging easier

[19:22:37] <Uranoxyd> from the looks it is a seperate process, but i am unsure if i can use strace, i take a look
[19:23:09] <NetSysFire> when did this start happening?
[19:23:14] <NetSysFire> could also be the result of an update
[19:23:24] <lntl> For some reason I thought there'd be no manpages
[19:23:53] <Uranoxyd> could be a update, but i rarely used the programm so i noticed it without knowing what i did in the meantime

[19:57:36] <dummys> I was looking to migrate to wayland I'm using awesome now, is there something that work the same under wayland ? Which tilling manager do you use under it ?
[19:58:21] <moonshine> the standard thing is sway
[19:58:35] <moonshine> if you don't know what to choose, that's safe.
[19:58:50] <dummys> ok nice
[19:59:15] <dummys> yes for now I want to migrate to wayland, but I'm starting to review stuff, like which project has the most active dev, commits etc
[19:59:22] <moonshine> sway.
[19:59:29] <dummys> I would like to have the same behavior as awesome
[19:59:38] <dummys> yes I'm looking at it right now
[19:59:51] <NetSysFire> there was an awesome wayland implementation called way-cooler but its abandoned
[20:00:11] <NetSysFire> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Wayland#Compositors
[20:00:12] <phrik> Title: Wayland - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[20:00:36] <moonshine> it depends on what you mean by "active" though... sway is mostly "done", so it's not going to change much from here on

[20:02:47] <NetSysFire> i am an awesome user and i prefer to stick to xorg for time being because i didnt find any awesome-like compositor
[20:05:02] <dummys> oh really ?
[20:05:09] <dummys> so you don't take a look at sway ?
[20:05:55] <NetSysFire> i tried i3. i hated it. sway is similar
[20:06:38] <moonshine> that's a strong reaction
[20:06:45] <NetSysFire> but if you dont mind changing your workflow you can use any other compositor
[20:07:34] <NetSysFire> yes because i3 doesnt support hiding windows, i absolutely hated its virtual desktop/workspace behavior and a few more minor things
[20:07:55] <NetSysFire> and now i am relatively happy with awesome, especially because its so insanely configurable

[20:12:09] <NetSysFire> yup
[20:12:11] <moonshine> i'm not that opinionated about it, sway does a nice job. hope there's someone working on a awesomewm-like compositor because of ... strong opinions
[20:13:02] <NetSysFire> sway works for a lot of people but if you want that awesome-workflow you wont find it in sway and either have to code your own thing or wait until someone else does it

[20:14:27] <dummys> I love to hide my window :D
[20:15:04] <moonshine> if i don't want to see a window in sway i just send it to another workspace. maybe that's crazy.
[20:15:21] <dummys> yes NetSysFire please tell us the workflow you spoke about just to understand

[22:11:28] <tonitch> Hello, Anyone can help me with sound issue ? I have a Grabsteer AV 350 that is supposed to have a video output and a sound output... I can see them both... I already tested the video and it works but the sound is not... I found this post that describe the problem and I can't make it to work either https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=209273
