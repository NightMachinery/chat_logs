[07:51:33] <lisp123> ns12: I wish there were public logs of #clschool.
[07:52:16] <lisp123> It would be very nice. I know the reason is anonymity for students, but IRC is already somewhat anonymous, so...maybe?
[07:52:18] <lisp123> Thoughts?
[07:53:02] <lisp123> If there is a public log, we can compile the best Q&A from time to time (I'd be happy to help when I have time)
[07:53:49] <ns12> It would be a good place to look for past explanations.
[07:54:43] <ns12> I am new to this channel. Do the same questions get asked over and over?
[07:55:07] <lisp123> Yes, but there's also many detailed discussions
[07:56:08] <ns12> What is the difference between asking here and in #commonlisp?
[07:59:10] <edgar-rft> ns12: in #commonlisp sometimes there are in-depth technical disussions where it's diffiult for newbies to ask basic questions in-between, that's why #clshool was created - but many #commonlisp folks are here, too
[07:59:22] <White_Flame> I don't think a public log is very useful
[07:59:27] <White_Flame> how would you find things in there?
[08:00:04] <White_Flame> also, people like to ask questions & receive answers in their own ways
[08:00:40] *** Joins: Jing (~hedgehog@240e:390:7c53:a7e1:b574:732d:3b12:8f10)
[08:01:25] <ns12> White_Flame: I sometimes find the answers I need from the public logs of #commonlisp. That has helped me a surprising number of times.
[08:01:51] <ns12> Google seems to index https://irclog.tymoon.eu/libera/%23commonlisp pretty well.
[08:03:24] <lisp123> White_Flame: I don't think you can find things historically, it would be too difficult. That said, I wouldn't mind reading a weekly log of #CLSCHOOL.
[08:03:41] <White_Flame> you can always keep your own logs :)
[08:04:07] <ns12> Yeah, but I only have logs starting from today :(
[08:04:24] <lisp123> I will soon (once I sort out my own personal server) :)
[08:05:28] <ns12> White_Flame: "how would you find things in there?" - By using a web search.
[08:05:29] <lisp123> There is so much useful material on the usenet logs, but a lot of that is also lost due to how hard it is to search
[08:05:50] <White_Flame> threaded discussion posts are also way more organized and edited than realtime chat
[08:06:12] <White_Flame> and I agree they're great to find info
[08:06:20] <lisp123> Indeed
[08:06:30] <ns12> lisp123: Is there an easily searchable copy of comp.lang.lisp that is not Google Groups?
[08:06:41] <lisp123> ns12: Yes of course
[08:07:01] <lisp123> https://github.com/ashok-khanna/lisp-notes/tree/main/Resources/Comp.Lang.Lisp%20Archives
[08:07:21] <lisp123> I take no credit, I think some user called noend2 compiled it
[08:08:00] <beach> I think we should work on my idea for an online Common Lisp "course", where the material is organized as a graph of small-ish chunks with different types of navigation possible, and with additional material when needed.
[08:08:22] <beach> Then most questions could be answered with a reference to that material.
[08:08:24] <ns12> lisp123: Wonderful! How would I search it myself? Is there some kind of indexing tool for that?
[08:08:31] <White_Flame> beach: I think such a thing would be reasonable
[08:08:43] <White_Flame> would you be an editor/moderator of it?
[08:08:47] <lisp123> ns12: Just write one :)
[08:09:18] <lisp123> beach: Happy to help on this. Any ideas on next steps?
[08:09:26] <ns12> I am not familiar with Usenet. I've never posted anything in Usenet...
[08:09:39] <beach> White_Flame: Sure.  My main problem is that we need a site to host it.  Metamodular is not good enough.
[08:09:56] <lisp123> https://www.lisp.wiki
[08:10:09] <lisp123> We can use. In my domain hoarding days, I got that one
[08:10:25] <lisp123> I will check if there is a .school domain
[08:10:28] <edgar-rft> your first Common Lisp task: write a program that reads the internet for you :-)
[08:10:31] <beach> lisp123: I would start working on individual chunks.  Like a chunk for "uniform reference semantics", etc.
[08:11:23] <lisp123> lisp.school seems available..
[08:11:47] <ns12> beach: Is metamodular your website. Those navigation icons are beautiful. How did you make them?
[08:11:57] <ns12> s/website/website?/
[08:12:00] <lisp123> beach: What would define a "chunk"? Perhaps you or other senior lispers can agree on the high level groupings and then we can start working on individual ones
[08:12:08] <beach> ns12: Heh, thanks!  I think I used Xfig.
[08:13:16] <beach> lisp123: Half a page of text, a video snippet, some figures, and perhaps links for more information.
[08:13:39] <beach> It should take no more than 10 minutes to digest.
[08:14:16] <lisp123> Got it. Makes sense. So bottom up based on ideas, and then one can figure out their organisation within the site later?
[08:14:47] <beach> That is typically how I work, yes.  I can't determine overall structure a priori.
[08:15:53] <lisp123> Sounds good
[08:17:16] <lisp123> Let's do it!
[08:18:45] <beach> I am completely swamped for at least another week, so I won't do anything.  And, we need to find someone willing to host it.
[08:26:34] <lisp123> I happy to handle that. Let me create a site and 1 draft article and then we can think about it further then
[08:27:46] <lisp123> If it doesn't work out, that's fine too. But if there's potential, then we can all keep plugging away and see where it ends up
