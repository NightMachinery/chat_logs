[02:16:52] <humanface> hi all
[02:16:54] <humanface> is it common to be late compared to estimations, when you are working 6 years in the industry?
[02:18:18] <JakeSays> i've been in the industry for 40 years and still mess up estimations on occasion
[02:19:12] <xb0o2> Easy solution
[02:19:22] <xb0o2> Take what you would've estimated prior to this incident
[02:19:23] <xb0o2> Double it
[02:19:31] <xb0o2> Add 2 weeks
[02:19:37] <xb0o2> Never make the same mistake again ;-)
[02:19:49] <JakeSays> aren't all estimations always two weeks? lol
[02:19:49] <xb0o2> It's utter bullshit anyhow
[02:20:35] <xb0o2> Well it's all 6 weeks now JakeSays
[02:20:38] <irwiss> quadruple your estimate, cause managers will cut it down to minimum anyway :P
[02:22:15] <JakeSays> xb0o2: ah. progress then
[02:22:37] <xb0o2> My original manager was very "how long will this take?" but fortunately I've manouvered the business into an acceptance of "it'll take however long it takes, just tell us what you want us to prioritise..."
[02:22:37] <humanface> irwiss yeah, but if I quadruple my estimate, managers are arguing with me
[02:22:51] <xb0o2> humanface: ask them if they're going to do the work?
[02:23:25] <humanface> xb0o2 well, that would be an arguing
[02:23:43] <xb0o2> And?
[02:24:16] <JakeSays> humanface: they have a choice - they can accept your estimate or they can argue.
[02:24:30] <xb0o2> Either you work for a moron (in which case my condolences) or you don't and they'll take on board what you say
[02:26:18] <JakeSays> i used to work with a guy who bragged about how much his team never missed estimates, and mine almost always did. the difference was the maintenance costs of the code produced by his team were 4x mine
[02:26:51] <JakeSays> at least 4x
[02:27:13] <JakeSays> customer service calls for his team were much higher as well
[02:27:43] <humanface> I see
[02:27:56] <humanface> but is it general to get these kind of messages from bosses that you're slow?
[02:28:16] <humanface> and they're shocked, when they realise that it's this kind of working hours left in the project?
[02:28:27] <humanface> because they're shocked usually in the middle of a project
[02:28:27] <xb0o2> Um, it depends
[02:28:33] <JakeSays> ^
[02:28:41] <xb0o2> Either you're terribly slower than estimated, in which case you need to ask why
[02:28:48] <xb0o2> Or the estimate was shit, in which case you need to ask why
[02:28:55] <JakeSays> i don't get messages like that because my bosses know i dont give a shit
[02:29:02] <humanface> well, the original estimation was estimated by the lead dev
[02:29:11] <humanface> and I instantly said it is impossible
[02:29:19] <humanface> but he said we need to do this in this time
[02:29:22] <humanface> well, it was impossible
[02:29:30] <xb0o2> So it's on his head to explain why he came up with such a poor estimate...
[02:29:51] <JakeSays> humanface: next time your boss says you're slow, remind him of that incident
[02:32:08] <xb0o2> I mean, if you're working at a level that's expected of you and you aren't meeting an estimate, obviously the estimate is unreasonable

I'm looking in the various files in this project. I am from a JS background and I am creating a React button in this app to reflect the state changes, but I need to hold it in memory on the server and then use signalR to send the request

[12:03:07] <ASUS> my boss said
[12:03:20] <ASUS> "you can remote desktop into a VM for one month"
[12:03:39] <ASUS> "then if we like you we will give you a PC (desktop case)"
[12:03:45] <ASUS> they expect me to have 2 PCs
[12:03:49] <ASUS> they won't give me a laptop
[12:04:13] <ASUS> they said they don't like it if I run VSCode on my gaming PC
[12:04:21] <ASUS> they want me to have another PC just for work
[12:04:30] <biberu> like you should
[12:04:47] <MatthiasVance> In any case, do not use personal hardware!
[12:05:11] <ASUS> I will have to use personal keyboard, and personal monitors
[12:05:16] <ASUS> and personal mouse
[12:05:36] <ASUS> and personal headset and personal microphone
[12:05:49] <biberu> work should supply that too
[12:06:00] <ASUS> yeah I think they are only giving me the systems unit
[12:06:08] <ASUS> the rest is up to me
[12:06:21] <ASUS> every day having to unplug and plug in USB ports
[12:06:50] <ASUS> it's going to wear the USB sockets and plugs out
[12:07:01] <biberu> bullshit, what if you don't have those things?
[12:07:08] <biberu> why should you pay for working?
[12:07:22] <ASUS> I told my boss I have a desktop
[12:07:28] <ASUS> so he is taking advantage of me
[12:07:33] <ASUS> he knows I have hardware
[12:07:49] <ASUS> pretty sure he is only gonna give me an old shitty box
[12:07:55] <ASUS> not new
[12:08:14] <biberu> not fun, but fundamentally his problem
[12:08:21] <ASUS> he said if I want to have a fast work PC I could salary sacrifice
[12:08:21] <MatthiasVance> ASUS: Just .. disagree?
[12:08:36] <ASUS> they aren't just going to pay for it unless it comes out of my salary
[12:08:49] <MatthiasVance> Then stop working until they provide hardware?
[12:09:12] <ASUS> they will only provide the computer without the peripherals I think
[12:09:22] <biberu> just start the computer and don't do anything since they didn't give you an input device ;)
[12:09:28] <ASUS> yeah
[12:09:29] <MatthiasVance> ASUS: Why do you accept this? xD
[12:09:35] <ASUS> the boss is kind of an idiot tho
[12:10:54] <biberu> re the performance, if they think it's worth it to pay for an engineer to wait on hardware to catch up that's their problem, if you can't convince them that it's costing them money it's not your fault, but it's probably more fun to with with someone with better priorities
[12:11:59] <MatthiasVance> But seriously, I have no clue why you didn't laugh in their face and walked out
[12:12:06] <biberu> once you have the hardware, and if it turns out to be an issue, just add up the cost of using that vs an estimate of how something newer would perform
[12:13:23] <ASUS> well

[12:15:15] <jmer> Sounds like an absolute shithole of a workplace

[15:54:17] <Tazy> So there are like tons of layers now that things are split into nuget packages, I am updating our http client to use System.Text.Json, but if I do, and get a new nuget package, that breaks like 5-6 other projects, so I just want to update 2 projects with this new version and let the rest of the projects still use the old one
[15:55:17] <MatthiasVance> Why not fix the other projects?
[15:55:23] <MatthiasVance> Or don't update the other 2?
[15:55:34] <MatthiasVance> You are introducing MORE complexity when you should be getting rid of it.

[16:03:19] <MatthiasVance> Apparently things are too tightly coupled?
[16:03:33] <Tazy> well it was all one solutin
[16:04:30] <MatthiasVance> In a solution you would have the same issues :)
[16:04:38] <MatthiasVance> If you want to upgrade 1 thing and things are too tightly coupled
[16:05:54] <Tazy> well it has started to move to use dependencies.props
[16:06:09] <Tazy> so you update in one place, and everything uses the same version
[16:09:46] <MatthiasVance> Yeah kind of like Paket, that is nice. But you can't do that when you're changing a lot of things in one place and they break other stuff.
[16:09:52] <MatthiasVance> You have to fix the core issue first
[16:10:07] <MatthiasVance> Well of course you can, the question is whether you should. I don't think you should :D

[16:19:15] <Tazy> okay this is weird, I getting a detected package downgrade from 3.1.14 to 3.1.14 <---- WHAT !
[16:21:35] <Tazy> The versions are the same, so how is there a downgrade ?!
[16:25:01] <interop_madness> maybe the version is a real number and the package manager rounds them :D
[16:25:56] <MatthiasVance> 3.1.14.00000000001
[16:26:02] <MatthiasVance> 3.1.13.00000000069
[16:26:08] <MatthiasVance> Whoops
[16:26:14] <MatthiasVance> 3.1.13.9999999969
[16:27:25] <Tazy> that still makes no sense
[16:27:56] <MatthiasVance> Jokes often don't.
[16:29:52] <Tazy> but I have a specific version linked in my project , and it says I need to reference it directly, but I am ?
[16:30:58] <MatthiasVance> I can't see what you're looking at :P
[16:31:04] <knmae> if (new_version > old_version) upgrade = true; else downgrade = true;
[16:31:26] <MatthiasVance> Does this mean you're determined to keep the tight coupling Tazy ?
[16:32:25] <Tazy> my second last day
[16:32:37] <Tazy> I can't change this, another country even needs to review that change
[16:33:30] <MatthiasVance> Oh you're leaving?
[16:33:33] <MatthiasVance> Then indeed don't care :D
[16:33:43] <MatthiasVance> I mean, do care and don't break things, but don't start an improvement
[16:33:56] <Tazy> same here, and like I got the answer, you can do it
[16:37:25] <Nasp> Tazy: Are you migrating from Newtonsoft to System.Text.Json?
[16:37:29] <Nasp> Just remember there's lots of breakign changes
[16:39:16] <Tazy> yep
[17:11:44] <interop_madness> I think I've reached my breaking point: on the one hand, I'm somewhat for a vaccine mandate, OTOH i can't NOT support trucker protest convoys ^^
[17:15:35] <Nasp> Mandate is an insane idea
[17:15:42] <Nasp> Also corona is gone on monday i've been promised
[17:16:01] <MatthiasVance> You are all "quantum entangled" now.
[17:21:04] <Tobbi_> Is anyone familiar with the "Install client side library" thing in VS?
[17:21:19] <Tobbi_> Does anyone know whether it's possible to not have it use the whole folder structure?
[17:34:12] <MatthiasVance> "the whole folder structure"?
[17:49:59] <Tobbi_> Like, if the source package has ./dist/some_name/js/ and ./dist/some_name/css but I only want the "js" and "css" directories.
[17:50:14] <Tobbi_> But it'll still create the /dist/some_name/ structure.
[17:50:46] <MatthiasVance> Ahh that thing
[17:50:57] <MatthiasVance> You have to look up the config documentation
[17:51:35] <MatthiasVance> I remember doing something like that before but I usually used npm and only included what I wanted, so it doesn't matter if the whole folder is on disk you don't touch it anyway
[17:53:23] <Tobbi_> right
[17:53:28] <Tobbi_> Okay, I'll check.

[23:39:29] <Bilz> hi. wpf mvvm question. I've got pdf viewer control, call it PDFView. PDFView has a method, GoToEnd(), such that it can jump to the last page of the pdf it is viewing. I want to use MVVM and commands and such, so I am wrapping the PDFView into my own UserControl, MyPDFView. MyPDFView. I am introducing dependencyproperties into MyPDFView, so that I can get things like PageNumber etc from PDFView. I'm trying to figure out the best way to have a button on my
[23:39:29] <Bilz> MainView (which contains MyPDFView) so that I click the button and it calls PDFView.GoToEnd().
[23:40:47] <Bilz> I could put a boolean dependency property in MyPDFView, and OnBooleanChanged I could call PDFView.GoToEnd() but it seems really hacky to have a boolean property change so I call a method on the view. What's a better way to do this?? I'm trying to avoid using events...
