[03:37:38] <akronymus[m]> Anyone who has knowledge about the SAFE stack: How am I supposed to do multiple pages?
[03:38:21] <akronymus[m]> I see App.fs using Program.mkProgram with a init, update and view function
[03:39:03] <akronymus[m]> But I can't seem to find out how I am supposed to serve a page when you are in a subdirectory.
[03:41:34] <akronymus[m]> And online tutorials are... lacking.
[10:38:00] <MatthiasVance> akronymus[m]: Are you using Elmish? I also found the online documentation severly lacking
[10:38:21] <MatthiasVance> But I know how to set up a proper Elm(ish) application now :D
[10:38:46] <MatthiasVance> It's super stupid that all the examples and docs talk about everything in one file and one shared state, yuck
[11:21:07] <MatthiasVance> biberu: So I am working on a <select> that contains the options of a DU and need to be able to test whether  my value is of said option to set attr.selected, any ideas except explicitly matching? :P
[11:21:15] <MatthiasVance> It seems like a waste to type it ALL
[11:24:18] <MatthiasVance> I guess the only other way is to use reflection, doesn't C# have something to enumerate this for .. enums? :D
[11:27:09] <biberu> MatthiasVance: an html select?
[11:27:20] <MatthiasVance> Yes using Bolero.Html here
[11:28:04] <MatthiasVance> So you can imagine wanting to enumerate all possible cases of a DU
[11:28:58] <MatthiasVance> Maybe I shouldn't, but it made me wonder.. :D
[11:29:18] <biberu> would probably just make a pair of mappers between the du and the serialization used by the select, e.g. value/label strings
[11:30:34] <MatthiasVance> Fair enough, that's "simpler" indeed
[11:34:09] <biberu> MatthiasVance: with ts i usually treat forms as separate from the domain, many controls will just work on strings so domain objects get serialized when sent to them, and them converted back in the validation
[11:34:31] <biberu> MatthiasVance: don't know if that kind of thinking is helpful for bolero though
[11:34:35] <MatthiasVance> biberu: I think I might also be able to just use GetType().. I only need the string
[11:34:45] <MatthiasVance> Instead of writing the mapper from DU case -> string manually
[11:36:03] <biberu> (you could still so that inside a mapping function)
[11:36:37] <biberu> mini-me wants to paint on the phone, later o/
[11:36:41] <MatthiasVance> :D
[11:36:47] <MatthiasVance> Thanks and have a nice day!
[14:47:10] <akronymus[m]> matthiasvance: it also only seems to talk about SPA's when I want to create a MPA.
[14:48:07] <MatthiasVance> I think that uses Fable with Elmish, right? Then it's only SPA
[14:48:23] <MatthiasVance> Unless you use Views with Giraffe or Saturn somehow
[14:48:57] <akronymus[m]> Wait, fable can ONLY do SPA's?
[15:08:47] <MatthiasVance> akronymus[m]: Fable is F# -> JS
[15:09:54] <MatthiasVance> akronymus[m]: I am staying away from the JS ecosystem and am using Bolero
[15:09:56] <MatthiasVance> (with Elmish)
[15:10:16] <MatthiasVance> Still SPA though :) But pre-rendered on the server (if you use ASP.NET Core)
[15:31:58] <biberu> MatthiasVance, akronymus[m]: didn't try, but I assume you should be able to compile f# -> js to use as you please, spa or not
[15:33:17] <akronymus[m]> I just want to separate my different subpages into different directories.
[15:33:33] <akronymus[m]> as in domain/something
[15:33:41] <akronymus[m]> and domain/somethingelse
[15:36:09] <MatthiasVance> That is just routing
[15:36:27] <MatthiasVance> You can do that with an SPA though
[15:37:15] <biberu> yeah, a url doesn't have to correspond to a file, if that's what you mean?
[15:39:04] <akronymus[m]> Oh.
[15:39:09] <biberu> that goes for both spas and traditional sites
[15:39:19] <akronymus[m]> Got any tutorial how to do routing?
[15:39:51] <biberu> the url is basically (a bunch of) parameters to a function that shows a page / view / returns an http response
[15:40:21] <akronymus[m]> To make it seem like it is a MPA (can they have differing underlying models?)
[15:40:23] <biberu> in a simple site it might be mapped to a file on disk, but it doesn't have to be
[15:40:43] <akronymus[m]> Oh, so I just choose the view based on the parameter.
[15:41:16] <biberu> yeah, whether you do it on the frontend or backend
[15:41:29] <biberu> an spa would normally use the history api (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API) to update the address as you navigate between different resources
[15:41:45] <biberu> frameworks usually take care of that
[15:41:46] <biberu> sec, brb
[15:42:25] <akronymus[m]> Personally, I prefer navigating by url and loading based on that, rather tham setting url based on state
[15:43:13] <biberu> yeah, ime it gets tricky when urls point to state rather than resources
[15:43:50] <biberu> e.g. if you need to sign in to read /article/123 just internally show a login view, don't redirect to /login?andThenDoThisConvulutedThing
[15:47:14] <akronymus[m]> Oh yeah, I probably am going to need an admin view...
[15:47:23] <akronymus[m]> Just for ease of development.
[15:48:04] <biberu> akronymus[m]: deciding between spa and traditional (server rendered) sites depends more on usage patterns
[15:48:29] <akronymus[m]> I wish to basically create a site to host my own experiments.
[15:48:45] <akronymus[m]> Which, IMO a MPA makes the most sense for, as each is its own thing.
[15:49:40] <biberu> e.g., is it important to have it easily indexable by search engines? accessible by users without js? do you need a highly interactive more application like ui? etc
[15:50:06] <biberu> for admin views it might also make sense to just have a separate site for back office features
[15:50:11] <akronymus[m]> I don't care about SEO
[15:50:24] <akronymus[m]> And some are gonna be interactive, some aren't.
[15:51:23] <akronymus[m]> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/524647729226317825/942381551931514900/20220213-102654-Eichkatzerl-id5002740.jpg ah sweet manmade horrors beyond our comprehension.
[15:51:28] <akronymus[m]> Wait, wrong channel.
[15:52:44] <biberu> there's no right channel for that
[15:54:19] <akronymus[m]> Actually, there is.
[15:54:26] <akronymus[m]> Just this isn't the one.
[15:55:52] <biberu> it reads like some pkd dystopia
[15:56:39] <biberu> wouldn't be surprised if he wrote a story just like it
