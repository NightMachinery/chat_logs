[12:37:09] <sqz> hi all, awk-enthousiast here. There's something I don't get, I want to remove '(){' from $1 using gsub("\(\){","",$1) (expected behaviour)..any idea awk wants: gsub("\\(\\){","",$1) ?
[12:37:19] <sqz> what's with the double slashes?
[13:21:17] <Patsie> first argument of gsub() is a regex and you're feeding it a string. awk first needs to translate it to a regex (translating the \( into a regular (
[13:21:23] <Patsie> and () in regex is a 'group'
[13:21:58] <Patsie> so you either use gsub("\\(\\){", "", $1) or use a regex like gsub() expects: gsub(/\(\)}/, "", $1)
[13:23:15] <Patsie> my choise would be to pass a regex as first argument in the first place, so option 2
[13:23:25] <Patsie> choice*
[13:23:46] <geirha> I'd escape the { too, since it also may have special meaning

[16:46:44] <sqz> thanks, that looks much cleaner. I guess I spent too much time using gsub  in lua (which requires passing regex as a string)

[18:41:50] <nmz> lua is cleaner than awk.
[18:42:19] <nmz> stick with lua, awk is only faster with matching and so on, but overall, lua is better.
[18:42:34] <nmz> hell if Patsie used lua he would not have so much trouble with his experiments
[18:44:19] <Earnestly> But his experiments would be extremely run of the mill and boring

[19:01:09] <Earnestly> Nice
