[04:04:13] <Steve-Dusty> :D
[04:04:28] <Steve-Dusty> but what was the cause of the before problem?
[04:04:56] <FunkyBob> it was JOINing the choice table... since there were two entries in the choice table for the question, you got two question rows...
[04:05:32] <FunkyBob> if you really want to delve into the difference, we can run a shell and get the SQL django produced in both cases
[04:05:38] <FunkyBob> compare it, and compare th results
[04:08:26] <Steve-Dusty> lol... I cleared my cache 2000 times
[04:15:59] <Steve-Dusty> https://dpaste.org/1UbX I want to check if the person who did choices is the same person who wrote that related question... I followed how the official source code of Django does it
[04:16:12] <Steve-Dusty> But it doesn't seem to work. I can only submit 1 choice
[04:17:22] <Steve-Dusty> I think I'd need model formset for this

[04:48:41] <FunkyBob> or big nasty "NO! NAUGHTY"! page
[04:49:06] <Steve-Dusty> LoL is it possible to delete the form after creation..?
[04:49:17] <Steve-Dusty> I meant after submittion
[04:49:24] <Steve-Dusty> so they cant come back to edit
[04:49:26] <Steve-Dusty> or something
[04:49:55] <FunkyBob> well, once they submit the page, you redirect them... so the form doesn't exist any more
[04:49:59] <FunkyBob> or do you mean pressing back?
[04:50:18] <Steve-Dusty> yes
[04:50:25] <Steve-Dusty> or they can come back to the URL to change it
[04:50:25] <Steve-Dusty> like

[04:50:48] <Steve-Dusty> when they press "submit" it just destroys pago

[04:50:59] <FunkyBob> when they press submit, it already does
[04:51:01] <Steve-Dusty> but how'd this work?
[04:51:07] <Steve-Dusty> Ohhh
[04:51:11] <Steve-Dusty> I use inline formsets
[04:51:14] <FunkyBob> it submits the data, making a HTTP request, and displaying the response
[04:51:22] <Steve-Dusty> people can still come back to edit it though
[04:51:32] <FunkyBob> on a successful POST, you should redirect

[05:03:35] <Steve-Dusty> So I could've done single page without JS??!!!?!!
[05:04:06] <FunkyBob> so long as you didn't want to dynamically change the choice count
[05:04:36] <FunkyBob> if you want to present, say, 10 empty forms... and only those they fill in get added... no JS needed
[05:04:52] <FunkyBob> if you want, instead, like you saw in admin... with dynamically adding extra forms... JS needed

[11:34:06] <lazerlapin> to me it means essentially: "first snippet produces Not [A] and Not [B]"
[11:34:25] <lazerlapin> "whereas if you want NOT([A] and [B]) you need to use second snippet"

[11:37:02] <hemebond> That's how I interpret it.
[11:37:52] <lazerlapin> Well then after testing it, it looks to me that the first snippet produces exactly NOT(A and B), same output as second snippet
[11:41:21] <hemebond> That seems to be the case.

[11:50:08] <shangxiao> i dunno i see it the other way around
[11:59:11] <hemebond> Hmm. I just re-read it and it matches the results.
[12:00:29] <hemebond> "this will not limit blogs based on entries that satisfy both conditions" this is the confusing part I think.
[12:02:52] <lazerlapin> hemebond well exactly, not only that, but then what's the difference between the results obtained by first snippet and second one?
[12:03:05] *** Quits: EvilDMP (~textual@django/moderator/EvilDMP) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[12:03:33] <hemebond> Oh hang on. This is m2m queries. My bad. Let me test that.
[12:03:50] <lazerlapin> Should I share a test project on github?
[12:04:23] <lazerlapin> I already have models that match docs (almost), Blog and Entry
[12:05:28] <lazerlapin> not necessarily m2m but one to many as well
[12:05:44] <lazerlapin> meaning we want to filter based on a relationship that is many
[12:12:31] <hemebond> They both seem to create the same result for me.
[12:15:29] <hemebond> I could raise a ticket/bug asking for clarification along with the output of your tests.
[12:18:45] <lazerlapin> yeah, just hoping we're not missing the obvious

[13:55:48] <hemebond> Oh yeah?
[13:56:20] <lazerlapin> the answer came from a deeper understanding of what those mean lol
[13:57:01] <lazerlapin> What was the data structure of your test?

[22:30:33] <roland92> Hi, is there a best practice for restricting access of generic DetailView/DeleteView to the user who created the object?
