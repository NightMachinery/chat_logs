[09:33:14] <OverCoder> Hi, I'm going to have an English placement test soon, the thing is that I'm kind of bothered by how some questions just have two valid answers.
[09:33:29] <OverCoder> I'd like to verify that the questions actually have two valid answers and that I am not being wrong about that
[09:33:32] <OverCoder> https://irc.overcoder.dev/uploads/ee1399480e4f7fa9/image.png

[09:34:08] <OverCoder> Am I correct?
[09:34:26] <amigojapan> Let me see OverCoder 
[09:34:50] <twb> OverCoder: in your first image, #1 and #3 are correct
[09:35:28] <amigojapan> I agree
[09:35:37] <twb> OverCoder: in your second image, #3 is wrong.  It needs parenthetical commas.  In casual speech I might overlook that.
[09:35:48] <twb> "She has, since 1980, lived in America."
[09:36:00] <twb> "She has — since 1980 — lived in America."
[09:36:04] <OverCoder> Aha, I've read it with that tone, noticed the missing commas but thought they could have also left them out by mistake
[09:36:07] <twb> "She has (since 1980) lived in America."
[09:36:16] <OverCoder> aha, got it
[09:36:17] *** Joins: furrykef (~furrykef@ip68-229-192-239.ok.ok.cox.net)
[09:36:29] <twb> My last three examples have the same sense – really just a style choice
[09:37:01] <twb> Without a parenthetic clause, we could correctly say...
[09:37:12] <twb> "She has lived in America since 1980" or "Since 1980 she has lived in America"
[09:37:16] <amigojapan> OverCoder: in Japanese language proficiency test we have the same problem in the highest level
[09:37:23] <OverCoder> It's slightly bothering the first question is like that though, as there's bunch alike and getting 96%+ mark can land me an exemption, which would be amazing
[09:37:54] <OverCoder> amigojapan, that's pretty bad
[09:37:56] <twb> Well I mean... you probably don't want to end up in America

[09:40:43] <OverCoder> I don't know the logic behind this but yes, the first sounds more natural (I'm not even a native English speaker)
[09:41:57] <amigojapan> OverCoder: in the jlpt, they have you read a whole long page and then choose between four options that are all possible
[09:42:54] <amigojapan> In N1
[09:43:00] <OverCoder> Uhuh, so basically a "what sounds like something a native speaker would say" type of test?

[09:53:06] <vim_fans> hi,there. Does anyone know what's the correct vocabulary to reference to the day of member of family dead?
[09:53:29] <twb> vim_fans: I don't understand the question.

[09:53:54] <energizer> anniversary of a death, perhaps

[11:54:38] <GuiToris> energizer, he's a native speaker, but I think he misread what I wrote

[11:55:06] <GuiToris> tell me what you think is wrong there, let's see if we are thinking of the same mistake or not

[11:55:28] <GuiToris> thank you, but I didn't ask it :)
[11:56:02] <GuiToris> oh, I meant the one who read out the sentence was native speaker too
[11:56:08] <GuiToris> sorry for the confusion
[11:56:41] <energizer> the tenses are wrong
[11:56:42] <inhahe_> Lebela: what about them?
[11:56:55] <Lebela> inhahe_, I need to know, how a native speaker would call them.
[11:56:59] <Lebela> is it a "timestamp" ?
[11:57:04] <Lebela> is it "time" / "times" ?
[11:57:28] <Lebela> In a sentence:  "The <placeholder> imprinted in this video may be slightly off"
[11:57:31] <GuiToris> energizer, ok, I think he misread it and he's saying 'by the time we arriveD at the wedding'
[11:57:34] <GuiToris> can you confirm this?
[11:57:35] <inhahe_> i'm native, but i'm not positive whether you'd call them a timestamp because timestamps tend to be static. this is continuously changing.

[11:57:42] <Lebela> The times?  The timestmaps?  The time information?
[11:58:05] <Lebela> inhahe_, that is the problem I see... timestamps should (in my linux experience) be an absolute value
[11:58:08] <Lebela> these times are relative
[11:58:14] <inhahe_> hmm
[11:58:18] <GuiToris> !d timestamp
[11:58:20] <Lebela> but saying "the times may be inaccurate".... is "times" a thing?
[11:58:21] <tinsoldier> timestamp — Noun: 1. (computing) A variable containing the date and time at which an event occurred, often included in a log to track the sequence of events., — Verb: 1. (transitive, computing) To record the date and time of (an event, etc). https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/timestamp
[11:59:05] <inhahe_> i think you could say "the times may be inaccurate", but it may be rather informal/not strictly correct
[11:59:16] <energizer> GuiToris: yes
[11:59:26] <GuiToris> energizer, thank you
[11:59:28] <Lebela> inhahe_, what would be format then?
[11:59:30] <Lebela> *formal
[11:59:33] <GuiToris> energizer, I wasn't sure about it
[12:00:03] <Lebela> inhahe_, basically I want to inform the viewer, that there might be something off with the DAY / MINUTE information imprinted in the video
[12:00:23] <Lebela> even when taking care real well, there can always go something wrong
[12:00:25] <energizer> there's probably a technical term but i don't know it
[12:00:52] <inhahe_> Lebela: maybe there's a better way I'm not thinking of, but you could say "the time information"

[12:04:36] <inhahe_> oh, another thing you could say is "the timing may be off"

[12:16:14] <Lebela> this is the one thing that confuses me about English... plural and singular

[12:16:39] <Lebela> but then you have information, and it's singular

[18:46:35] <darsie> When you're submersed in the movie story/universe and something rips you out of that.
[18:46:38] <brigand> "I thought the movie was really suspenseful, until they made this cinematic mistake."
[18:47:13] <darsie> Like you stop following the story and focus on the mistake they made.
[18:48:01] <darsie> I'm not emphasizing how suspenseful it was/is.
[18:48:56] <darsie> In my case they used a fake surveillance camera where there should have been a real one.
[18:52:42] <SkunkyLaptop> hrm.  so, the lack of realism in the small details ruined the movie for you?
[18:53:03] <darsie> Well, it was a clip of a Monk episode.
[18:54:06] <darsie> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op5Recjx4YA&t=201s

[18:57:53] <darsie> I doubt this model comes with a motor.
[18:58:21] <darsie> They would have had to retrofit it with a motor.

[18:59:50] <SkunkyLaptop> it's a fake camera for tv, of course it cam with a motor, tho the "camera" is likely just an empty box with a motor in it.
[19:00:14] <darsie> Oh, this one has a motor activated by a motion sensor.: https://www.deluxecctv.com/catalog/dummy-cameras/motion-activated-dummy-security-camera-blinking-led-light-968.html
[19:01:09] <darsie> Still a fake camera. And it dropped me out of suspense, or however you say that.
[19:03:24] <SkunkyLaptop> yeah, not really suspense... more... ummmmmm
[19:03:58] <TimMc> "Suspension of disbelief" is *related* but probably not what you want either.
[19:04:35] <TimMc> I might say that it broke the immersion, but I wouldn't be happy with the phrasing. :-)
[19:05:54] <SkunkyLaptop> I'm sure there's a phrase to describe this, but I can't think of it right now.
[19:07:54] <darsie> Hmm ... In a dramatic work, suspense is the anticipation of the outcome of a plot or of the solution to an uncertainty, puzzle, or mystery,[2][3][4][5] particularly as it affects a character for whom one has sympathy.[6] However, suspense is not exclusive to fiction. 
[19:08:23] <darsie> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspense
[19:09:45] <brigand> !d immersion
[19:09:47] <tinsoldier> immersion — Noun: 1. The act of immersing or the condition of being immersed., 2. (Britain, Ireland, informal) An immersion heater., 3. (mathematics) A smooth map whose differential is everywhere injective, related to the mathematical concept of an embedding., 4. (astronomy) The disappearance of a celestial body, by passing either behind another, <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/immersion>...
[19:11:31] <darsie> others claim that uncertainty remains even for often told stories because, during the immersion in the fictional world, we forget fictionally what we know factually[20] or because we expect fictional worlds to look like the real world, where exact repetition of an event is impossible.

[23:20:57] <pussipupu> Pretty sure “pound sand” refers to walking off
[23:21:12] <pussipupu> As in if they don't like it they can leave
[23:21:39] <pussipupu> But maybe that's my imagination

[23:28:43] <MetaNova> I've always understood it to mean, roughly, "you should go do something else which is a better use of your time than speak to me, which includes things such as pounding sand (a pointless exercise)"

[23:30:34] <MetaNova> +tell blkshp <jonix> blkshp: Sorry Sir. Yesterday you answered my query at #english but i was away from the keyboard. Just wanted to say thanks!
[23:30:34] <chat> Done.
[23:30:48] <jonix> thank you MetaNova 
[23:30:51] <MetaNova> np
[23:34:47] <TimMc> pussipupu: Yeah, I guess I kind of imagine someone being told to go run laps. Makes sense if it's originally from a military context.
