[02:27:37] <dale> bpalmer: I think you would want to pin it to ELPA now.
[02:27:44] <jeremyc> dale, no. I have that already there. I can go to my scratch buffer and put (package-refresh-packages) (package-install 'org) and it'll report already installed. C-h v org-version reports 9.3. Doing M-x package-list, then installing org by pressing i, it upgrades to 9.4.4.

[04:24:38] <bpalmer> parsnip: are you trying to get punishment applied in this case, or are you trying to get ops to commit to reviewing multiple years of interactions whenever a disagreement occurs?

[04:25:01] <parsnip> i'm trying to get the issue well understood and for JordiGH to understand

[04:26:02] <bpalmer> #emacs ops are not in a position to police anything but #emacs (and perhaps other channels in the #emacs namespace), so "out of irc" is not something that is in our bailiwick

[04:28:40] <oksolution8> Hello
[04:30:46] <dale> ,greet oksolution8 
[04:30:47] <fsbot`> Terve, oksolution8
[04:31:22] <bpalmer> parsnip: the most that ops can do with mighty op powers is, really, mute or ban somebody. So "punishment" can be applied, should it be called for, but it might not ever change anybody's mind. Sometimes it may just lead to people avoiding behavior because they fear the consequences, not because they agree
[04:32:05] <bpalmer> parsnip: now, speaking not in terms of what ops might do: from what I saw, jordigh flew off the handle and was unpleasant
[04:32:50] <bpalmer> So there is room for op intervention; but as I started to say yesterday, not everybody in the channel is going to get along
[04:34:50] <oksolution8> I've been looking for a 6809 assembly mode for Emacs. Can anyone recommend one (if there is such a thing?)?
[04:34:57] <parsnip> besides flying off the handle or being unpleasant, it was my impression that they went on and on and on with what words they were putting in my mouth
[04:35:58] <bpalmer> parsnip: So there has to be some room for friction that doesn't get slammed down. As long as /ignore is commonly available, anybody in the channel has a tool that can help as long as the situation isn't spiraling (by involving more people or consuming the channel)
[04:35:59] <parsnip> misquoting, etc
[04:36:34] <bpalmer> parsnip: but this gets into what precisely your goal is. They're not currently on the channel; they're not around. We rarely apply punishments long after the fact
[04:36:39] <parsnip> incessantly putting words in someone's mouth seems inappropriate
[04:36:48] <bpalmer> parsnip: this is apparently the continuation of an argument from 2 years ago.
[04:36:57] <parsnip> so this has happened two or three times now
[04:37:46] <parsnip> it just seems like someone more clever than myself could reason with this person, since apparently they are a scientist

[04:38:55] <parsnip> yeah, i don't care about "punishment"
[04:39:09] <bpalmer> oksolution8: have you tried the generic asm-mode ?
[04:39:11] <parsnip> i'm worried about this person continuing to approach things this way, especially to my benefit
[04:39:52] <parsnip> but if ops can slow it down when the faucet turns on, that's nice too
[04:40:19] <bpalmer> parsnip: at this point, all of the active ops are aware; I do encourage you to think about /ignore the next time this thing happens, because that doens't rely on anybody else (and as long as the confrontation doesn't spiral to involve more people, is trivial and loses you almost nothing)
[04:41:04] <parsnip> if someone runs into your village and starts yelling witch...
[04:41:10] <bpalmer> oksolution8: most assembly in emacs just uses the generic one as a base, which is ... old-fashioned but works, I think
[04:42:56] <oksolution8> bpalmer: yeah, it works. I was wondering if there was something specifically made for the 6809. When I do x86 assembly, I have to use a different mode, since the generic one messes up indentation :\

[11:11:48] * bpalmer rolls eyes at the description of design patterns above
[11:12:08] <aidalgol> bpalmer: Which one? :P
[11:12:25] <bpalmer> "pattern" is a euphemism ...
[11:12:30] <aidalgol> ah, that one.
[11:12:35] <aidalgol> It feels true sometimes.
[11:12:47] <bpalmer> iterators, for example, are a straightforward design pattern implemented in many languages.
[11:12:49] *** Quits: taharqa (~weechat@ns511930.ip-198-100-146.net) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[11:13:14] <aidalgol> Especially from my experience with Java.  Not always, but a lot of patterns I've found common in the Java world feel like clunky hacks to work around missing language features.
[11:13:15] *** Quits: krux02 (~krux02@p200300e81719330059822492d9593bdc.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Remote host closed the connection)
[11:13:20] <bpalmer> The idea of separating traversing data from operating on data is something you can just stick into a function. It's literally a pattern you can just use when you're designing things.

[11:13:32] *** Quits: Plazma (~Plazma@user/plazma) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[11:14:17] <bpalmer> A different design pattern that handles the exact same issue but inverting it is map (or mapcar, or std::for_each, or...)
[11:14:31] <aidalgol> For example, I genuinely hate the builder pattern and would always rather be using keyword constructor arguments, but nope, can't do that, because "considered harmful," or whatever reason the language designers give for not adding this.
[11:14:57] <bpalmer> and a third way is to ignore both of those design patterns and just smush together non-abstracted loops with non-abstracted statements.
[11:15:46] <aidalgol> bpalmer: When I hear the term "design pattern", it is most often in the context of what I can describe as overly prescriptive patterns.
[11:16:13] <aidalgol> Like the Gang of Four school of programming.
[11:16:47] <aidalgol> "If you see a problem that vaguely fits this description, then you should write these five classes and hook them exactly this way.
[11:16:48] <aidalgol> *"
[11:16:59] <bpalmer> the Gang of 4 book is not nearly as bad as some people describe. For example, Iterator and Visitor patterns are both described there; and factories are useful

[11:17:34] <aidalgol> Yeah, the entire book is not bad.  But I found it a bit verbose, and some chapters I strongly disagree with.
[11:18:03] <twb> bpalmer: IME the bad overwhelmingly outweighs the good
[11:18:04] <aidalgol> I think I just realised that I am orbiting the idea of cargo culting.
[11:18:17] <aidalgol> My problem is with design pattern cargo culting.
[11:18:26] *** Joins: Dalvini`` (~nil@2a01:e34:ec21:a20:3cf2:bbde:35a1:f903)
[11:18:34] <bpalmer> There's a lot more to programming than just gluing together things, but in practice, a huge part of thinking someone is an "idiomatic" or even "good" programmer in a language is how adept they are at working with the common patterns that suit the language.
[11:18:49] <bpalmer> gluing together design pattern instances, I mean.
[11:18:53] <aidalgol> twb: OK, but you're also a sysadmin.  You have very different concerns and priorities than most software developers not focused on sysadmin, yes?
[11:19:23] <aidalgol> I genuinely do feel that the Java ecosystem takes these concepts to the extreme.
[11:19:33] <twb> aidalgol: yes, absolutely
[11:19:56] <twb> My job is 95% gluing existing things together, using whichever language is best suited for the problem
[11:20:13] <aidalgol> Even when I'm working with a language that I dislike, I genuinely try to follow its conventions and not fight my tools.
[11:20:18] <codingquark> I have started to enjoy sysadmin work :-P
[11:20:29] <twb> aidalgol: what I usually do is write a comment along the lies of
[11:20:37] <twb> # This wouldn't be necessary if this was Common Lisp
[11:21:21] <aidalgol> Related: https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/mars
[11:21:51] <aidalgol> "Goddamned users.  Someone switched off gravity."
[11:21:52] <twb> aidalgol: an extreme case would be mmdebstrap.  mmdebstrap is written in perl bceause the author couldn't work out how to express it in their normal language (python).  Then, it has a helper tool called "tarfilter" which is written in python again, because it literally can't be written in perl.  And there's a comment saying "not using golang because that's too bloated for this piece of glue"
[11:22:01] <aidalgol> "Looks like if we spin everything it works OK.  Good enough for me."

[11:22:26] <aidalgol> twb: golang also has the static linking issue.
[11:22:36] <bpalmer> Wait, tarfilter literally can't be written in perl?

[11:23:00] <bpalmer> oh, that's just library support
[11:23:02] <twb> bpalmer: perl's tar library reads the entire tarball into RAM before opertaing on it
[11:23:16] <codingquark> parsnip: I watched 2 eps of Foundation >.<
[11:23:17] <twb> For a 2GB tarball that is deeply suboptimal
[11:23:29] <parsnip> codingquark: i watched 1.5 episodes
[11:23:41] <twb> bpalmer: likewise mmdebstrap could strictly be written in python, but you'd have to write your own pipeline infrastructure first
[11:24:02] <parsnip> codingquark: i'm now watching ST:D again
[11:24:12] <bpalmer> 'from sh import ...'
[11:24:13] <aidalgol> I don't entirely get go.  It feels like "we took ML's style of concurrency and made it resemble C".

[12:53:01] <wasamasa> which is a hard compatibility break
[12:54:10] <andreyorst> I mean, if there's two libraries with the same prefix in function name, this shorthand thing does nothing to allow me using both libraries
[12:54:12] <wasamasa> and it merely abbreviates existing long identifiers
[12:54:22] <andreyorst> unless you do something like (defun com.gihub.username-foo ()) (defun com.github.username-bar ()) ... then you're probably safe

[12:55:21] <andreyorst> here's an example with seq.el
[12:55:28] <wasamasa> yeah, that helps understanding it
[12:55:34] <wasamasa> the upside is that it doesn't break tooling
[12:55:48] <wasamasa> unless tooling assumes what you type is the same as what it's resolved to
[12:56:10] <wasamasa> like, you have to type out long identifiers when grepping for their uses
[12:56:19] <wasamasa> and it works to find the original definition, but not the renamed ones

[13:08:55] <twb> codingquark: so I bought paneer from greeks instead of indians, and it's still sealed in plastic, but I didn't use it straight away.  The sticker says it's "best before 2022-02-01" or so
[13:09:11] <twb> codingquark: it's probably a month old, but it smelled kinda funny, so I binned it :/
[13:09:21] <wasamasa> this demonstrates a shortcoming of the CL package system, where the package comes with its own "nickname"

[13:10:08] <andreyorst> well, it's a POC

[13:12:24] <andreyorst> (which I'm most familiar with)

[16:40:41] <bpalmer> ways to deal with these might be to find-file and then check whether point-min equals point-max; or find-file, search for all non-whitespace and if any are found, it's not what you're looking for

[17:21:38] <bpalmer> you can load any elisp you'd like, wherever it's located; new definitions will overwrite previously defined definitions of the same name.
[17:22:08] <bpalmer> ispell is almost certainly loaded "on demand" , so as long as you load your package first, you shouldn't any real worries about a previous definition, though.

[17:23:50] <bpalmer> But (load "/path/to/hacked/ispell.el")  , or just make sure "/path/to/hacked" is first in the load-path  before you (load "ispell") or, assuming it's not previously been loaded, (require 'ispell)
[17:24:16] <aadcg> in this case, I would perhaps use eval-buffer 
[17:24:24] <bpalmer> if ispell or the hacked package is a multiple file path, you should mess iwth load path rather than an absolute filename

[21:00:42] <yrk> no player was being called, or the player binary was missing
[21:01:11] <johnjay> yeah but i couldn't identify it. i eventually figured out (car players) was the line that was choosing which player to use

[21:23:22] <rdrg109> [Q] How to escape a string in Emacs? I want to escape \ and " characters and possibly other characters.
[21:23:28] <johnjay> \
[21:23:31] <johnjay> or \\
[21:23:45] *** Joins: tromey (~tromey@174-16-0-219.hlrn.qwest.net)
[21:24:01] <johnjay> the \\ is sometimes necessary because the regex engine runs after the lisp engine. so both of them interpret strings
[21:24:35] <rdrg109> I want to send a Javascript expression through a Lisp function that will execute the expression in a javascript engine, so the function looks like: (slime-interactive-eval "(ffi-buffer-evaluate-javascript-async (current-buffer) \"console.log('a')\")")
[21:24:36] *** Joins: brainfreeze (~brainfree@2a03:1b20:4:f011::20d)
[21:25:00] <rdrg109> Here's another example: (slime-interactive-eval "(ffi-buffer-evaluate-javascript-async (current-buffer) \"console.log('a\\\"b')\")")
[21:25:27] <rdrg109> I'm trying to send a Javascript Emacs buffer to Nyxt
[21:26:27] <johnjay> normally \\ is fine... but i'm not sure here. maybe try a few test strings first
[21:26:43] <wasamasa> prin1-to-string is a very cheap escaping function
[21:26:51] <wasamasa> it's designed for lisp values though, not JS
[21:27:04] <wasamasa> you'll need to write something custom to get JS stuff right
[21:27:42] <johnjay> wasamasa: prin1 won't return a string in any way?
[21:28:07] <wasamasa> judybot: eval (prin1-to-string "a\\\"b")

[21:33:13] *** Quits: jmd (~user@de.cellform.com) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:33:21] <wasamasa> so if you evaluate (some-cl-nonsense) with slime, that is turned into (slime-interactive-eval "(some-cl-nonsense)")
[21:33:44] <wasamasa> this can be handled with prin1-to-string because you turn a s-expression into a readable string
[21:33:59] <wasamasa> but you want to go one level further and have that CL code evaluate JS code?
[21:34:15] <rdrg109> Yes
[21:34:18] <wasamasa> which, to make things worse, is generated on the fly depending on emacs buffer contents?
[21:34:20] *** Joins: op2 (~op@user/op2)
[21:34:37] <rdrg109> Yes
[21:35:11] <wasamasa> so you need both, a print-js-to-string and prin1-to-string
[21:35:46] <wasamasa> you can write a print-js-to-string with loads of string regex replacement or by buffer manipulation
[21:35:57] <wasamasa> the latter is a lot easier to get right
[21:36:41] <wasamasa> I wrote an escape JS string function in JS before, there's a spec for how it should behave
[21:37:40] <johnjay> wasamasa: is the confusing part from the fact printing a string and how the string actually is might be different?
[21:38:17] <wasamasa> sure, you need to know what characters are actually in the string before you try displaying a printable version which can be read in by a parser
[21:38:30] <wasamasa> but it's multiple confusing parts really

[23:19:59] <dale> Let's make Emacs trading cards with pictures of core developers.
[23:20:56] <bpalmer> will there be separate rules for tournament play?
[23:21:27] <dale> Only past three years' cards for the Grand Prix events.
[23:21:33] <acdw> dale omg yes please
[23:21:54] <seabass> dale: trump cards hehe

[23:22:53] <dale> As it happens I know very little about MTG.  I believe there is "grass" or "lawns" or something that give you energy, cards can be tapped, it seems like a perfect invention to take people's money, and I know the butt cracks guy.

[23:27:31] <bpalmer> Oops, I just used up one of my last free articles (per month? per year? per lifetime?) at MIT Technology Review on an article that '"Magic: The Gathering" is officially the world's most complex game'
[23:27:34] <dale> I was going to say, we have an embarrassment of computing resources at our fingertips, just throw CPUs at it, not much "AI/ML" needed, but the size of the problem space is perhaps too large to make that truly viable.
[23:27:55] <acdw> bpalmer oh noooooo
[23:27:59] <dale> I'll wait patiently for Google to release AlphaMTG.
[23:28:48] <bpalmer> "Determining whether one player has a winning strategy is equivalent to the famous halting problem in computer science."
[23:29:14] <dale> rudybot: I read a third article on the MIT Technology Review and now the gem in the palm of my hand is black.  Should I be worried?
[23:29:15] <bpalmer> I really wish paywall-limited articles adopted a convention of letting you choose whether to spend a freebie token on it or not.
