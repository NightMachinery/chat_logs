[01:07:49] <akoana> hi, I've a Common Lisp program in an emacs slime buffer. The first line is: (ql:quickload "split-sequence"). When I try to compile with C-c C-k,  (ql:quickload "split-sequence") is not evaluated and I get an error "Package SPLIT-SEQUENCE does not exist. So I've to  C-M x on the ql:quickload line, after that compile works without errors. How to get emacs to eval ql:quickload with C-c C-k ?
[01:08:45] <akoana> (this happens with every package I try to ql:quickload)
[01:08:59] <pjb> akoana: you should write an asd file instead. The problem is that a function call is only evaluated at load time, not at compilation time.
[01:09:12] <pjb> akoana: if you insist you can wrap the quickload in an eval-when form.
[01:09:42] <pjb> (eval-when (:compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute) (ql:quickload "split-sequence")) â€¦
[01:10:16] <akoana> pjb: ah, thanks a lot, I tried eval-when .. but left out :load-toplevel :execute 
[01:10:43] <akoana> gonna try your suggestion...
[01:11:15] <pjb> The compiler needs to know the package and the macros, and what symbols are defined as functions.  But assumedly you will use split-sequence also at run-time.
[01:11:36] <pjb> Only if you used it only in your macros, you wouldn't need it at run-time and could exclude :load-toplevel.
[01:12:08] <akoana> pjb: thank you very much, your solution worked perfectly!
[01:15:06] <akoana> ah, and now I understand a little bit more why eval-when exists :)

[12:41:32] <Harag> Morning
[12:42:09] <Harag> can any body point me to any lisp projects on gitlab that has implemented CI intergration
[12:43:09] <White_Flame> continuous integration integration, I like it
[12:43:28] <Harag> I am trying to figure out how to get message of failed tests back bash and I am sure having a look at some examples I can figure the rest out
[12:44:04] <Harag> the cookbook example uses a make file but does not show what is in that make file
[12:45:27] <Harag> so I need to know how to go from sbcl --noinform --non-interactive -eval "1" to EXIT 260 in bash
[13:03:43] *** Joins: hendursaga (~weechat@user/hendursaga)
[13:05:03] <pjb> sbcl --noinform --non-interactive -eval "1" -eval '(sb-ext:exit 260)' # ?
[13:05:29] <pjb> Harag: but gitlab can process test result in some json format.
[13:06:17] <Harag> yes but if I can raise an EXIT that is not 0 in the bash script that runs the projects tests then the tests will faile
[13:06:18] <pjb> JUnit XML
[13:06:48] <Harag> yes and I have written a test package that produces junit xml 
[13:07:00] <Harag> but that is used to report on failed tests
[13:07:30] <Harag> you still have to fail the tests to stop further steps happening in the .yml file
[13:07:39] <pjb> Yes.
[13:08:02] <pjb> Any program can return a non-zero status.  
[13:08:21] <Harag> what is any program?
[13:08:40] <pjb> sbcl, make, bash, any program you may mention in the yml script sections.
[13:09:05] <Harag> ok so how does sbcl do it?
[13:09:35] <Harag> sbcl -eval "How do I raise a exit of non zero here"
[13:11:04] <pjb> Sorry, it is: (sb-ext:exit :code 260)
[13:11:13] <Harag> aaaah
[13:11:23] <Harag> thank you very much!!!
[14:40:36] <Harag> sbcl --noinform --non-interactive --load /tmp/quicklisp.lisp --eval '(quicklisp-quickstart:install :path "~/quicklisp/")'
[14:41:02] <Harag> results in a  Error initializing *DEFAULT-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS* with the current directory:
[14:41:02] <Harag> getcwd: No such file or directory
[14:41:35] <Harag> is it the "~/quicklisp/" should it be the full path?

[23:08:43] <Harag> Finally cracked running gitlab CI and that on custom sbcl docker image hosted within gitlab that also auto builds through gitlab CI....yeaaaaha 
[23:09:12] <thrig> sounds complicated?
[23:09:40] <Harag> in the end it was not
[23:09:51] <Harag> it was the little gotchas that was painfull
[23:11:37] <Harag> the custom image was needed to cut down run time from minutes to under a minute and should help with limits etc in gitlab.com
[23:14:21] <Harag> then custom image cuts down the .yml file needed to kick of testing for a project to 9 lines of code
[23:17:31] <pjb> yeah, it looks like a custom image is the best way to do whatever we need to do in gitlab CI.
[23:18:14] <Harag> thrig: your more than welcome to grab the image if you want to its public
[23:18:31] <thrig> not sure what I'd do with it
[23:19:37] <Harag> I can include the usage yml file and then you just need to create a project to host your image and include the yml file in projects you want to use ci with... simple as that
[23:20:22] <Harag> it would help if you have tests for you own projects to hook up in the yml file ;)
[23:20:25] <pjb> Harag: note: the makefile is strange, no TAB before the command linesâ€¦  and there's a "ssbcl" occurence.
[23:21:13] <Harag> will have a look I dont thin gitlab uses the make it only uses the imagebuild yaml file.
[23:21:27] <Harag> it does build locally though
[23:22:21] <Harag> that ssbcl is just a name so that why it is not causing issues
[23:22:24] <Harag> will fix it
[23:22:36] <Harag> tag actually to be more precise
[23:23:50] <Harag> mmm my emacs cleanup script on save removed the tabs
[23:24:59] <Harag> have the same issue with yaml files and yaml-mode does not have a indent-region so started using gedit for the yaml files ... :()
[23:25:51] <Harag> indent-region in yaml-mode does really crazy things
[23:28:32] <pjb> Harag: it's easy to filter out file-names from save hooksâ€¦

[23:41:38] <tyson2> Harag, would like to try out your docker image

[23:47:36] <tyson2> thanks
[23:51:14] <Harag> Just added readme.org to help
[23:55:01] <Harag> pjb: I am using derived-mode-p in the clean up scripts but for makefile will have to resort to file name check. Just dont have the energy for it right now ... lol
