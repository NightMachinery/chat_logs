[03:52:26] <sachac> yup, BBB
[03:52:34] <sachac> and Icecast for streaming
[03:52:52] <sachac> this time, with more prerecorded videos so we don't have as many technical issues
[03:53:10] <sachac> howard-abrams: thanks so much for rerecording your interrupted presentation, by the way :)
[04:05:28] <howard-abrams> Ha! That was year's ago. Rebuilding an apartment has taken up all my free time, so next year, I can probably help with the presentations, and other things next year ... this year, I'm going to enjoy it as a spectator! Besides, it looks like we have a great line-up again.
