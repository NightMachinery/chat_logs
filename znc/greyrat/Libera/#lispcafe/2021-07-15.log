[07:52:19] * hayley wonders how OpenCL finds rotate(v, 31UL) (where v is a ulong) to be an ambiguous call.

[10:44:38] *** Joins: treflip (~user@95.79.32.99)
[10:57:05] <dave0> rotate is a better primitive than shift
[10:58:24] <dave0> you can't shift by more than the width of the int, but rotate is just always mod the width of the int
[10:59:53] <dave0> and rotating by a negative number is just like a large positive number
[11:02:09] <hayley> Excellent, now SOLVE works.

[17:20:31] <shka> i am after the first interview with the ravenpack
[17:20:41] <hayley> Congratulations!
[17:26:56] <shka> hmmm, thanks
[17:27:28] <shka> but honestly, this may be premature ;-)
[17:27:46] <shka> and i misunderstood the position 
[17:36:27] <shka> so we gonna see how the following interviews go
[17:36:48] <shka> at least i am at this point well familiarized with the CL
[17:37:02] <shka> the above may be understatement 
[17:43:32] <selwyn> shka: nice one
[18:00:56] * hayley feels like a bit more of an asshole than usual.
[18:01:51] <hayley> I threw a GPU program at a phony cryptocurrency that is designed to only be mined on Arduino boards. Thought it was some kind of scam and I thought it wouldn't actually bring any money to anyone.
[18:02:33] *** Balooga_ is now known as Balooga
[18:02:55] <hayley> It was just some random 17 year old kid's pet project. I apologised...eh not really. I said I was a jackass and I should just not bother anyone involved but didn't apologise.
[18:09:05] <SAL9000> I'm guessing your "Arduino" crushed the competition?
[18:09:57] <selwyn> did you make loads of $
[18:11:18] <hayley> SAL9000: Well, you can mine on a desktop, but there are a few orders of magnitude between their program and mine.
[18:11:39] <SAL9000> Yeah, GPU >> CPU and yours is probably better optimised too :-)
[18:12:41] <hayley> selwyn: Nope, you don't get paid proportional to hash rate really. It's not even proof of work; you just guess the number based on the hash the server gives you, and if you get it the server bumps your account. So not even a cryptocurrency.
[18:13:07] <selwyn> i have never understood crpyto
[18:13:39] <hayley> n.b. by hashes/second/watt I believe my GPU is 12000x more power efficient than an Arduino Uno.
[18:15:10] <hayley> The only insight was to reuse the buffer with the previous hash and nonce so that we wouldn't waste time copying again. Otherwise the GPU port was just a mechanical translation really and I only won because of sheer parallelism.
[18:16:18] <hayley> selwyn: The best parts of having a decentralised, government-free currency with all the worst parts. And nowadays the best parts are gone.
[18:17:19] <hayley> Back in my day (2015?) the fees were tiny on Bitcoin. Now the fees suck. Honestly, that's the only best part I can think of anyway.
[18:19:00] *** Quits: treflip (~user@95.79.32.99) (Quit: bb)
[18:21:51] <hayley> In any case, yeah, fun project and all, and I think people making backplanes for microcontroller boards is cute, but people trying to make money out of this is damn stupid.
[18:23:57] <SAL9000> once bitcoin ASICs became a thing the original "decentralised" nature was gone
[18:24:34] <SAL9000> now, AFAIK, >50% of total bitcoin mining power is controlled (indirectly) by one entity = bitcoin can be forged/duped
[18:25:05] <hayley> Not sure about one entity, but last I checked like 57% of the hash rate went through four pools.
[18:27:43] <hayley> You can't dupe bitcoin, but you can send it then magically decide to resend it to someone else. Which I guess also sucks for the original recipient still.
[18:29:49] * hayley was contemplating a minimal proof of work for Netfarm, to make it somewhat slower to spam, but decides to shelve the idea if you can teach a GPU to find work faster.
