[23:40:08] <ahmed-rezk-devAh> Is there is away to show typescript  type definition in floating window instead of opening the files having the types? It's only shows the types on hover if it's in the same file?
[23:40:29] <ii14[m]> you mean like the code?
[23:40:43] <ii14[m]> I think there are plugins for that
[23:41:06] <ii14[m]> but we don't have anything like that by default
[23:41:13] <ahmed-rezk-devAh> Yes.  Could you tell me the name please. 
[23:41:43] <ii14[m]> I saw something like that, but I don't remember the name
[23:42:16] <clason[m]> you probably mean https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/wiki/User-contributed-tips#peek-definition
