Since I'm not building a web application, both Django and
[02:10:55] <white_magic> FastAPI are not options for me, so I was thinking of just using SQL Alchemy. But what about mapping json to SQL Alchemy classes? Basically, what's the practical approach for this when I'm not building a web app

[04:26:08] <grooverman> Now, here's the thing, with curl I have no issue.
[04:26:29] <grooverman> It redirects to the intended page, just like a browser.
[04:26:35] <grooverman> but with requests, everything is weird.
[04:26:48] <grooverman> On curl, I does this:
[04:26:52] *** Quits: Celeo (~Celeo@user/celeo) (Quit: Leaving)
[04:29:31] <grooverman> curl -i -s \
[04:29:31] <grooverman>         'https://my.server/App/Pages/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fApp%2fPages%2fEntityList.aspx' \

[04:29:41] <grooverman> and it works nicely
[04:30:09] <nedbat> grooverman: can you put the requests code, and the other details in a pastebin?
[04:30:56] <grooverman> hear me out
[04:31:05] <nedbat> grooverman: sorry?
[04:31:42] <grooverman> requests differentiates between url parameters and "params" parameters
[04:31:45] <grooverman> curl does not
[04:32:16] <grooverman> requests is sending the target url (where the server has to redirect to) twice
[04:32:46] <grooverman> on the url parameters, and on the "params" parameters
[04:33:30] <grooverman> So the server tries to redirect to a url that does not exist: https://my.server/App/Pages/EntityList.aspx,/App/Pages/EntityList.aspx
[04:33:52] <alexandro> Hi?
[04:33:54] <nedbat> grooverman: this really would be easier if you could put details in a pastebin
[04:34:00] <nedbat> alexandro: hi
[04:36:26] <stealth_> grooverman, url you are giving requests doesn't look like its same as one you are giving to curl
[04:37:02] <stealth_> grove `.aspx,/App/...` whats up with `,...` part?
[04:37:35] <grooverman> stealth_: that's the problem, what the server is saying I did.
[04:37:59] <stealth_> grooverman, ok then you probably did!
[04:37:59] <grooverman> for some reason the .NET server does not understand requests' requests.
[04:38:04] <nedbat> grooverman: i guess you don't want to share the python code?

[04:41:48] <grooverman> Of course all the variables are filled nicely previously, I even manage to authenticate correctly, the problem and the error is about page redirection.
[04:42:14] <grooverman> The multiple variable definitions are because I'm trying all possible combinations, and in every case there is a weird behavior from the server.
[04:42:25] <grooverman> Not the case with requests coming from curl.
[04:45:40] <nedbat> grooverman: i don't see why requests would behave differently
[04:45:52] <grooverman> But it does.
[04:46:09] <grooverman> it differentiates between url params and "params" params.
[04:46:19] <grooverman> it duplicates them even
[04:46:41] <grooverman> the server, on the other hand, also differentiates, but expects the client not to
[04:46:47] <grooverman> that's a huge problem there!]
[04:47:02] <stealth_> grooverman, you can't use `/App/Pages/...` you need to use `%2fApp%2fPages%2fEntityList.aspx` for all of them
[04:47:30] <nedbat> grooverman: i would try to move the url params into the params dict
[04:48:13] <grooverman> nedbat: already tried that. In that case it doesn't authenticate, it just returns  some unauthorized page.
[04:48:26] <grooverman> without the login token
[04:49:02] <grooverman> if you mean into the params dict only
[04:49:06] <grooverman> already tried that
[04:49:11] <grooverman> all possible combinations
[04:50:33] <grooverman> By the way, this is legacy software, totally out of my control. Can't do anything to the server side.
[04:50:51] <grooverman> I need the requests module to behave like curl does.
[04:51:30] <stealth_> anything after `?` needs to be url encoded

[14:17:13] <Yhg1s> pro: is that your _exact_ problem, or did you just go looking for similar ones?
[14:18:14] <Yhg1s> pro: because that problem is about select(), which does not deal well with many file descriptors. The real solution is to not use select, but one of the replacements that do much better on all fronts.
[14:18:45] <pro> Yhg1s: I use the same library, and hit the same 340 cap, so I'd say it's exactly my problem
[14:19:18] <rendar> `f(x:int|float, ...)`  can i use this in python 3.9.6? or otherwise, can i import this from the future? and if so, how?
[14:20:25] <Yhg1s> pro: looks like the library is using select(), so the way to avoid the problem is to not use the library, patch the library, or (futily) recompile Python, yes.

[18:23:58] <jamwil> Ah, found a good section of the docs: "For a GUI interface-driven application, the scope of the Session may best be within the scope of a user-generated event, such as a button push. Or, the scope may correspond to explicit user interaction, such as the user “opening” a series of records, then “saving” them."

[18:38:06] <Helle> Dev0n: it depends on the I/O to memory to CPU load of the code
[18:38:29] <Helle> typically in general task use, 2x the workers to CPU cores is the right call
[18:38:30] <theprophet> The-Compiler so this is not the right command? https://ibb.co/8b2WmPw
[18:39:43] <Dev0n> Helle, no I/O, cpu is around 20% and memory around 40%, at this point, the bottleneck seems to be workers blocked because of tasks. I've got two dedicated machines with 4 cores each. So at most I'm able to run 8 task concurrently. I'll try 2x CPU cores and see if this improves.
[18:39:49] <The-Compiler> theprophet: --icon sets the icon it should use for your .exe (i.e. before you open your program). That's different from the icon used for your window after it starts.

[23:30:46] <phy1729> useless use of cat, but also could easily miss edge cases
[23:31:22] <shimbles> it could easily answer the question of which was more specific, though.
[23:31:44] <phy1729> It can't though
[23:32:02] <phy1729> consider /(000|1729{1729})/
[23:32:03] <shimbles> yes it can, you can simply compare the result sets. unless they are very close, the shorter list is more specific.
[23:32:25] <phy1729> (yeah yeah it just repeats the 9)
[23:32:31] <shimbles> obviously your fuzzer should generate data that might match
