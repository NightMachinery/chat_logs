[03:16:58] <lf94> truth has different meanings
[03:17:06] <lf94> multiple variants of truth
[03:17:07] <PlanckWalk> We can prove that it does in many circumstances, but that's a bit circular.
[03:17:20] <lf94> (just as there are multiple meanings of equality)
[03:17:22] <Franciman> truth requires an external world
[03:17:29] <Franciman> otherwise what we care about is mostly consistence
[03:17:31] <Franciman> consistency
[03:17:55] <Franciman> (if we accept «ex falso quodlibet» ofc)
[03:17:56] <lf94> someone actually said it really, really nicely. The truth is a discourse with your reality and seeing what it says back.
[03:17:59] <PlanckWalk> No, consistency is a separate property
[03:18:14] <lf94> "your reality" -> reality I mean
[03:18:18] <Franciman> if you don't have an external worl
[03:18:19] <lf94> minus "your"
[03:18:20] <Franciman> world
[03:18:23] <Franciman> you don't have truth
[03:18:24] <PlanckWalk> It's possible for a system to be consistent but not sound.
[03:18:28] <Franciman> so what's left is consistency
[03:18:47] <lf94> again i think there is some miscommunication.

[04:05:08] <Kaylah> my objective is to determine the profile with the A and I values that lead to the smallest N value but still greater than N_min
[04:05:38] <Kaylah> sorry I suppose the correct way to put it would be N = f(A,I) >= N_min
[04:05:58] <Kaylah> I was wondering what the best way to approach this would be
[04:07:01] <Kaylah> I could of course just run the calculation for each separate profile and then find the smallest N value which is greater than N_min, but I'd like a more elegant way to do it
[04:08:39] <Kaylah> I expect that there will be a clear trend: the N value will increase as we go down in the table of profiles
[04:10:04] <Kaylah> so I could also do some kind of binary search: I start by calculating N for two profiles 1/3rd and 2/3rds down the table, then based on whether their N-values are greater or smaller than N_min, I determine 2 new profiles to calculate it for
[04:10:26] <Kaylah> and after a few iterations like that I could easily get to the most appropriate profile

[04:16:59] <PlanckWalk> If you don't even know they're ordered by N, then you have to search each element.  If you know they're ordered but nothing about the distribution otherwise, the best you can do is binary search.
[04:17:26] <PlanckWalk> If you know more, e.g. that the N values are approximately linear, then you can do better than binary search.
[04:17:38] <Kaylah> hmm yeah I see
[04:17:55] <Kaylah> if it's linear then I could almost immediately determine the best profile based on any 2 N-values
[04:18:03] <PlanckWalk> But in practice binary search is good enough.  Even a billion items needs only 30 tests.
[04:18:10] <Kaylah> cool
[04:19:06] <Kaylah> I might've oversimplified it a bit though, the profiles are hollow circular tubes for instance and they have 2 important properties that in their turn have an important effect on A and I and hence on N
[04:19:16] <Kaylah> the 2 important properties are diameter and thickness
[04:19:47] <Kaylah> so for instance there are profiles with radius x thickness: 50x1, 50x2, 50x3, 60x1, 60x2, 60x3, ...
[04:20:21] <Kaylah> so the N values might decrease and increase as we go down the table

[04:20:44] <PlanckWalk> So it's probably monotonic for each variable?
[04:21:01] <Kaylah> yeah exactly
[04:21:24] <PlanckWalk> In principle then you would have a "frontier" of n = N_min
[04:21:25] <Kaylah> for a constant thickness, N will only increase as the diameter increases, and for a constant radius, N will only increase as the thickness increases
[04:22:03] <PlanckWalk> As in if you have a 2D table, you might expect a curve of constant N
[04:22:47] <PlanckWalk> (Imagine that you can get every radius and thickness, not just discrete ones)
[04:23:17] <PlanckWalk> So you'll be looking for a point near the curve, on the correct side of the curve.

[04:25:35] <Kaylah> hmm yeah I see what you mean
[04:26:17] <PlanckWalk> In general if you had M points randomly distributed in the table, about sqrt(M) of them would be candidates for the closest point
[04:27:21] <PlanckWalk> So you can't do as well as a binary search here
[04:27:23] <Kaylah> it would probably look something like this I suppose: https://i.imgur.com/xxAhgYm.png

[04:27:53] <PlanckWalk> Yes, that sort of thing, with point for each item on that chart
[04:28:11] <Kaylah> indeed
[04:28:50] <PlanckWalk> If N2 was your threshold, there would be something like sqrt(M) points that weren't "obviously" far from the N2 curve
[04:29:16] <Kaylah> hmm and how do you arrive at sqrt(M)?
[04:29:17] <PlanckWalk> Obviously in the sense that there is a point closer to it in both thickness and diameter

[04:31:52] <PlanckWalk> If you imagine overlaying a grid on the chart and putting at point at each intersection in the grid, then only consider boxes that intersect the curve, that's the sort of relation you get
[04:32:10] <Kaylah> yeah I see
[04:32:29] <PlanckWalk> So that's about the theoretically best you can do here
[04:32:41] <Kaylah> I'm just not sure how I would actually determine which points those are
[04:33:18] <PlanckWalk> However if you need to look up "the best" N lots of times and the items are always the same, then you can cache results
[04:33:35] <PlanckWalk> E.g. just calculate their N values once and order them by N
[04:34:14] <PlanckWalk> Then you can do binary search or better on that fixed table many times
[04:34:28] <Kaylah> indeed I thought of that too, but N also depends on a few quantities that are situation-specific
[04:34:39] <Kaylah> a few other input variables basically
[04:35:21] <PlanckWalk> You might just have to search the whole table every time then
[04:35:41] <PlanckWalk> Or, well, maybe not *all* since N might still be monotonic in thickness and radius

[04:37:27] <PlanckWalk> Yes, that sort of thing could help
[04:37:36] <Kaylah> and then the same for their minimum thicknesses

[04:58:31] <isekaijin> One thing I dislike about empty types in programming languages is that “T = Either Foo Void” is supposedly isomorphic to “Foo”, but it takes some amount of cleverness of the compiler's part to realize that all T's are Left's, and hence the tag can be eliminated.
[04:59:18] <isekaijin> So if you use Void a lot, then you're potentially adding lots of wasteful tags, or hoping that the compiler will be clever and eliminate them.

[13:41:01] <riv> yes you proved that rotation by 180 degrees does not work
[13:41:33] <riv> but you can flip the thing around the perpendicular line, that is a symmetry
[13:42:56] <riv> ah
[13:43:02] <riv> you can rotate it by 180 degrees around a point on the line
[13:43:06] <riv> but the line does not go through the origin
[13:43:21] <riv> but you can rotate it 180 degrees around (0,-2) for example

[19:07:43] <Z-module> tom__: If ~ is your equality relation on X (or diagonal, as you called it), then then set X/~ is nothing but { {x} : x in X }. Each equivalence class is a singleton. Using the quotient topology, where a subset U of X/~ is open iff the corresponding set { x : {x} in U }  is open in X, the proof of q being a homeomorphism is practically a tautology.
[19:08:15] <blackk> I think the explanation is weird.. its is better to work with an elliptic curve in weierstrass form or lagrange form

[21:21:26] <Simplar> int-e: I just started to wonder what did Knuth mean when he phrased his exercise as 'find a general formula of sums 1^2, 2^2-1^2, 3^2-2^2+1^2, 4^2-3^2+2^2-1^2, and so on, and prove it by induction'
[21:21:47] <Simplar> What I've pointed out is the formula I've assumed to be the formula for these sums
[21:22:51] <int-e> you've written down an alternating sum. there's a much simpler closed formula

[21:30:33] <joel135> i think this the sought relation between the two: consider the integral I = ∫_∂(A×B) h(x,y). for separation of variables assume that h(x,y) = f(x)∧g(y). then I = ∫_(∂A×B + A×∂B) h(x,y) = ∫_(∂A×B) f(x)∧g(y) + ∫_(A×∂B) f(x)∧g(y) = ∫_(A×B) df(x)∧g(y) + ∫_(A×B) f(x)∧dg(y) = ∫_(A×B) (df(x)∧g(y) + f(x)∧dg(y)) = ∫_(A×B) d(f(x)∧g(y)). something like that.
[21:31:53] <joel135> i should say = ∫_(A×B) dh(x,y) at the end to make it prettier
[21:32:58] <cheater> hi
[21:33:09] <cheater> what is that function that moves the phase of all frequencies by pi/2?
[21:35:28] <joel135> you are seeking to multiply each frequency component by i, but this is the same as multiplying each data point by i, since the fourier transform is linear
[21:38:17] <cheater> eh, nah, i'm not talking about fourier transforms.
[21:38:23] <cheater> there's a function that does that explicitly

[21:40:06] <cheater> Hiblert transform. I knew it started with H
[21:40:31] <cheater> The Hilbert transform has a particularly simple representation in the frequency domain: It imparts a phase shift of ±90° (π⁄2 radians) to every frequency component of a function, the sign of the shift depending on the sign of the frequency
[21:41:31] <joel135> ok, +/-
