[04:47:39] <dre_> I knew it was /best practise/ which i thought was a requirement, until i accidently forgot it
[04:48:04] <dre_> FunkyBob, do you know how to make bread / pizza? how the shit do you stop the dough from sticking to the hand / board
[04:48:09] <dre_> I'm so furious
[04:48:56] <dre_> apparently just need to leave it for a bit before I try to knead it
[04:52:37] <GinFuyou> dre_, just sprinkle flour around. If dough gets too sticky while kneading - add little flour to it directly it's shouldn'y be too sticky for pizza
[04:57:20] <dre_> that NEVER works; I hate that answer
[04:57:39] <dre_> I have to literally site the dough in a bed of flour. like a massive one, for that idea to work
[04:57:46] <dre_> it's way too wet
[04:58:03] <dre_> but I follow every recipe to exactly.
[04:58:04] <GinFuyou> Then you dough mixture is wrong
[04:58:32] <GinFuyou> Don't follow recipes exactly, adjust to resuly
[04:58:38] <FunkyBob> dre_: more flour
[04:58:49] <FunkyBob> if it's well sticky, you need more flour

[05:46:01] <humanBird> i ran python manage.py collectstatic and 0 files were copied.
[05:46:24] <humanBird> I'm looking at django config and am wondering if static_root makes it so only one root directory is searched and staticfiles_dirs are just subdirectories of root
[05:47:02] <humanBird> i printed out what os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "my_images") was and it was an absolute path to where the images are.
[05:47:23] <FunkyBob> humanBird: static root is where all the static files need to be copied _to_
[05:47:33] <FunkyBob> it iis not ever a source of static files to copy
[05:47:46] <humanBird> ok.
[05:48:02] <humanBird> Any particular reason why 0 static files would be copied when the staticfiles_finders is correct?
[05:48:04] <FunkyBob> collectstatiic wil gather files from $APP/static/ where APP is each of the packages in INSTALLED_APPS
[05:48:12] <FunkyBob> and anything listed in STATICFILES_DIRS
[05:48:48] <FunkyBob> if your STATIC_ROOT is also listed in STATICFILES_DIRS it can cause problems
[05:49:20] <FunkyBob> has it copied more t han 0 files in the past?
[05:49:28] <FunkyBob> or is this your first run of it for this project?
[05:50:10] <humanBird> i'm running biostar's forum app and copied over the build folder from the output of a react app into the biostar/static folder which is listed in the staticfiles_dirs
[05:50:38] <FunkyBob> ok, and what did you set STATIC_ROOT to?
[05:51:31] <humanBird> STATIC_ROOT = join(BASE_DIR, 'export', 'static')
[05:51:55] <FunkyBob> and that is absolutely _not_ one of your STATICFILES_DIRS or app static dirs?
[05:52:55] <humanBird> it is.  for some reason it's only copying from one particular folder
[05:52:58] <FunkyBob> (printing values at the end of your settings.py can be helpful)
[05:53:17] <FunkyBob> wait.. it _is_ one of your staticfiles dirs?
[05:53:50] <humanBird> i have a few entries in staticfiles_dirs just to experiment
[05:54:35] <FunkyBob> yes, but I'm trying to get a clear answer from you about this one mistake
[05:55:54] <humanBird> hmm i might need to change the entry from build/static (the react directory structure) to just build
[05:56:08] <FunkyBob> ok, well... enjoy
[05:56:39] <humanBird> I got some new copied files.  i'm getting 404s on those resources now
[05:58:27] <FunkyBob> I was trying to help you debug it...

[05:59:16] *** Quits: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[05:59:43] <humanBird> the copy problem is gone now
[06:00:07] <humanBird> it was react storing static files in both build/static and the root directory of the react build folder
[06:01:25] <humanBird> i see now that the react app is requesting http://127.0.0.1:8000/image.png and django wants http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/image.png
[06:01:33] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[06:04:19] <humanBird> guess this is a django + react integration problem.  I either have to run some script before copying into django folder or change react build to change everything to /static or something
[06:04:46] <FunkyBob> it's not clear why react needs to care, tbh...

[06:08:58] <humanBird> it makes sense that the 8000/image.png url doesn't work since there's no url mapping.  how do i get the app to request from static?
[06:09:44] <dre_> dough is rising, kitchen is clean, wife is visiting relatives; time to django
[06:10:17] <dre_> FunkyBob, i... .i actually just followed a random recipe off the net for the pizza, and put home made dried pizza herbs in the dough :P
[06:10:19] <FunkyBob> humanBird: that depends.. how does your app know aht image exists?
[06:10:25] <dre_> gonna layer it with anchovies
[06:10:37] <humanBird> which app? django or the react app?
[06:11:18] <humanBird> the react app server hosts everything at :3000 and it appears that it's accessing the image at :3000/image.png
[06:13:06] <humanBird> ok. so it's the react app that's a problem.  read somewhere that window.location.origin was the way to go to specify src=
[06:13:25] <humanBird> but that is not correct.  it works only in the react app but not in django since it strips out the "static"
[06:13:39] <FunkyBob> unless you're using HMR, there's no need tto run a react server...
[06:13:50] <FunkyBob> (or server side rendering, I guess)
[06:13:55] <humanBird> i'm not doing DRF with standalone
[06:14:06] <FunkyBob> ... wat?
[06:14:18] <FunkyBob> standalone what?
[06:14:34] <humanBird> i'm comparing how the react app serves it's images when it's run without django and when django tries to serve images.
[06:14:37] <FunkyBob> you keep sayng  things that almost make sense
[06:14:55] <humanBird> standalone react server just making CORS requests to DRF
[06:15:20] <humanBird> i'm not doing that. that's impossible since the biostar forum does so much back end rendering

[06:16:24] <humanBird> the problem I think is the following line of code in the uncompiled react app: src={window.location.origin + '/image.png'}
[06:17:31] <humanBird> that will translate into whatever babel compile code as http://127.0.0.1:8000/image.png which runs like that in django, which expects http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/image.png http://127.0.0.1:8000/image.png http://127.0.0.1:8000/image.png  src={window.location.origin + '/staffBar.png'}

[06:18:47] <humanBird> ok i'm just going to experiment and build/compile the app again with 'static' to see if this makes the 404s go away.  I know this isn't the right way but this will confirm

[20:35:57] <Steve-Dusty> help
[20:36:00] <Steve-Dusty> i really need help rn
[20:36:13] <Steve-Dusty> does anyone know how to get a checkbox value
[20:36:21] <Steve-Dusty> i need to check if a user clicked on the checkbox
[20:39:27] <LordKalma> In RDF it says, in, https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/relations/#writable-nested-serializers
[20:39:35] <LordKalma> " you'll need to create create() and/or update() methods"
[20:39:39] <LordKalma> you really need both, right
[20:39:39] <LordKalma> ?
[20:43:35] <Steve-Dusty> LordKalma im not using DRF
[20:43:40] <Steve-Dusty> I'm using raw Djangfo
[20:44:01] <Steve-Dusty> and I wonder how to know if a checkbox in HTML is selected CHECKED or not checked
[20:44:04] <Steve-Dusty> how would I find out
[20:44:19] <Steve-Dusty> because im making an unlisted button. if they click unlisted their video wont appear on feed
[20:44:33] <hylje> it will set its NAME as VALUE in the form's data
[20:44:36] <hylje> if checked
[20:44:46] <hylje> if not checked, there will be nothing on its NAME in the form data
[20:47:27] <LordKalma> Steve-Dusty, I was not answering you :) sorry
[20:48:06] <hylje> LordKalma: i don't think you *need* both, just that creating (no existing object) and updating (existing object) are different
[20:48:31] <LordKalma> if I want to have both operations, I basically need both, right?
[20:48:40] <hylje> yes
[20:57:18] <LordKalma> thanks
[20:57:35] <LordKalma> It's just some weird models and serializers, so I was wondering

[21:08:48] <LordKalma> btw, does the update() (L208) look ok?

[21:33:34] <Steve-Dusty> hylje so how do I do it
[21:33:44] <Steve-Dusty> `if unlisted == True` ?
[21:35:00] <hylje> Steve-Dusty: if you use django forms to handle the checkbox form (with a booleanfield) you will get a True/False in the cleaned data for that field
[21:35:17] <Steve-Dusty> what if I'm not
[21:35:19] <Steve-Dusty> what do I do?
[21:36:07] <hylje> idk it's either in request.GET or request.POST (dict-like objects)
[21:36:31] <hylje> you don't give enough details for definite answers
[21:37:41] <Steve-Dusty> I did `        unlisted = request.POST.get('unlisted', False)`
[21:37:53] <Steve-Dusty> that's how I got the value
[21:38:05] <Steve-Dusty> but doesnt work when checkmark is clicked
[21:38:51] <hylje> is the checkbox inside a form that points to your view? is the form a POST form? do you submit the form?
[21:39:54] <Steve-Dusty> yess
[21:40:16] <hylje> what's the checkbox html like? <input type=checkbox name=unlisted>?
[21:40:40] <Steve-Dusty> ```        <label>
[21:40:40] <Steve-Dusty>             <input type="checkbox" name="unlisted" />
[21:40:41] <Steve-Dusty>         </label> Unlisted <br> <br>
[21:40:41] <Steve-Dusty>         ```
[21:41:04] <Steve-Dusty> https://dpaste.org/Yp0J
[21:41:06] <Steve-Dusty> here
[21:41:11] <Steve-Dusty> with my whole view.py
[21:41:31] <hylje> okay :D i think you will need to give the checkbox a value too. does the unlisted variable in your view receive the empty string as its value or False?
[21:42:00] <GinFuyou> Steve-Dusty, use the Form. You are doing django wrong
[21:42:31] <hylje> idk it's ok to do it the hard way, that way you appreciate how the shortcuts make it easy for you
[21:50:34] <Steve-Dusty> GinFuyou . noooo
[21:50:40] <Steve-Dusty> it'd be SUPER hard to style with forms
[21:50:41] <Steve-Dusty> like
[21:50:48] <Steve-Dusty> how do i access the CSS from a forms.py..?
[21:50:52] <GinFuyou> Lies
[21:50:55] <hylje> you can use forms and still write your html manually
[21:51:03] <GinFuyou> It has nothing to do with css
[21:51:11] <hylje> all it wants is you to tag your inputs with appropriate names and values
[21:52:34] <GinFuyou> You still  can set widget attributes in a Form, but surely manual or semi-manual rendiring is often better
[21:53:19] <hylje> you might also want to handle error output and such, but you are free to do it in any way you see fit
[21:54:08] <Steve-Dusty> plz send welp
[21:54:22] <Steve-Dusty> i'll do that later
[21:54:30] <Steve-Dusty> but i wanna learn how to checkbox without forms.py
[21:54:46] <Steve-Dusty> oh wait
[21:54:59] <Steve-Dusty> lemme give it a value first
[21:55:16] <GinFuyou> Don't waste time on harmful knowledge

[23:55:55] <dre_> if I have a CreateView for "create new comment on this section" and it's in the url "/post/new/<slug:section-name>"
[23:56:06] <dre_> how do i get the section-name into the form through get_initial() ?
[23:56:13] <dre_> i tried initial['section
[23:56:31] <dre_> i tried initial['section'] = self.kwargs.get('section-name')         but that no worky :c
[23:58:44] <GinFuyou> Should it be in initial to begin with?
[23:59:24] <GinFuyou> also what exactly "doesn't work"? By looks of it, it shouldn't work but implementation may vary
[23:59:33] <dre_> yeah the url is linked from that "section" -- ie: "make a new post in this section" or whatever.
[23:59:54] <dre_> GinFuyou, I think it's just because I'm giving the form the slug, not the actual Object.
