What am I doing wrong?
[08:16:58] <ryzendar> same with positive lookbehind: -regex ".*\(?<=foo\)bar.*" -- nothing matches

[09:02:49] <ryzendar> oh, and even if I use ! -name "*foobar*" specific to that one part of the larger regex, if that file matches in other parts of the regex, which should include the file after all,then the ! -name rule will override that, so that sucks
[09:13:36] <yitz> ryzendar: that's a glob, not a regex
[09:13:49] <yitz> A regex would be `.*`
[09:14:21] <yitz> GNU find has a -regex and -iregex test
[09:15:00] <yitz> You can AND tests
[09:16:53] <rewt> so you want a regex that both rejects and accepts certain patterns?
[09:20:05] <rewt> but anyways, this isn't really a regex question; it's more of a tool question, so should be directed to gnu (or whichever flavour of find you're using) ... unless you want to share your actual full requirements, and see if it's possible without a lookbehind

[16:53:35] <gzakh> Hi, how come, putting  "/tree/ig" (regex syntax) into ms word "find and replace" (given that "wildcard characters flag is checked) window gets out "no match" result?
[17:01:40] <digitok> regex != wildcards
[17:01:49] <digitok> wildcards are like * and ?
[17:06:44] <gzakh> what am I supposed to do with "regex != wildcards" ?
[17:06:45] <gzakh> I have ms word open. Should I put "regex" into "Find and replace" window?
[17:08:26] <digitok> no, i mean wildcards are not regex
[17:08:39] <digitok> and, afaik, ms word does not support regex
[17:09:16] <gzakh> does this mean that regex does not work with / in ms word?
[17:09:49] <digitok> it means regex does not work at all in ms word
[17:10:39] <gzakh> which text editors can I possibly use to edit long ms word texts?
[17:11:45] <digitok> you could copy the text into a regex tool like regex101.com
[17:12:27] <gzakh> how many pages can regex101.com handle at a time?
[17:13:27] <digitok> o.O
[17:13:41] <digitok> at can handle a large amount of text
[17:13:49] <digitok> it does not work in "pages"
[17:16:23] <Andrio> It can handle one page. We don't care about how big that one page is though. 😛
[17:16:26] <gzakh> how can I export the text back into ms word - copy > paste?
[17:17:02] <digitok> yep
[17:19:07] <gzakh> and what is the Microsoft logic behind using wildcard character tool in Find and Replace engine?
[17:19:38] <gzakh> If it is not fully compatible with regex language...

[22:14:02] <purplex> dut: in python, i'd create dict (map) to replace things, then use it to replace all the things one by one. It seems in python using regex, you can't replace different things all at once

[22:19:51] <re101-lynx-10> i'll try to make sense!
[22:19:51] <re101-lynx-10> so i have a csv file that has a dinamic format, i read the header(1st line) to know how it's formated (Done!)
[22:19:52] <re101-lynx-10> I create a list of tuples that show me how it's formated

[22:21:00] <purplex> yeah 'pasting multiline text' is considered spam in this chat
[22:21:29] <re101-lynx-10> ohh! sry! i was trying to be "clean"
[22:21:31] <purplex> you can paste lines after some delay or, type
[22:23:39] <re101-lynx-10> i was trying something like this (it's far from what i want sry, the pattern is auto generated) : https://regex101.com/r/bltGkY/1
[22:26:02] <re101-lynx-10> btw, is there any chance to call a function that comes in the input string to work on the input string itself with regex?
[22:28:15] <purplex> what function or, input string comes in https://regex101.com/r/bltGkY/1 ?
[22:29:41] <re101-lynx-10> tuples = [('Número', 1), ('Nome', 1), ('Curso', 1), ('NotasUm', '3'), ('NotasDois', '3', '5'), ('NotasTres', '2', 'sum'), ('NotasQuatro', '2', '6', 'sum'), ('last', 1)]
[22:31:13] <re101-lynx-10> tuples[5][2] = "sum" => using sum for a input like the one you see in regex101
[22:33:10] <purplex> no wait, what do you want done with string: 3162,Cândido Faísca,Teatro,1,2,3,1,2,3,4,5,1,2,1,2,3,4,5,6,over again?
[22:34:44] <re101-lynx-10> i want to validate and process, for example tuples[0] means the first field on the string is a simple field
[22:36:27] <re101-lynx-10> in tuples[5] i know that i need to process 2 fields (separated by commas in string) with the function sum (need to sum to fields and return the result)
[22:36:51] <purplex> let me see, you want to validate if first number has 4 digits, followed by a string comma, another string and then bunch of numbers 1,2,3,1,2,3,4,5,1,2,1,2,3,4,5,6 separated by a comma?
[22:37:22] <purplex> you're mixing 'python' in the regex context which kind of makes it hard to understand
[22:37:35] <re101-lynx-10> it's a csv, so every "field" is separated by comma
[22:38:00] <re101-lynx-10> the header gives you the format of the data fields
[22:38:59] <purplex> i think you want to validate if csv row contains data input as you expect using a regex
[22:39:09] <re101-lynx-10> exactly
[22:39:11] <purplex> and then you can do whatever you want using python
[22:39:58] <re101-lynx-10> yes, the problem is that the rows don't remain static...they vary if difrent files are given
[22:40:50] <re101-lynx-10> so by reading the header i get the format... then i need to create a pattern  so i can validate and process all lines in the csv file being used
[22:40:59] <purplex> is the first number restricted to 4 digits and are rest of numbers only a single digit?
[22:41:36] <purplex> more you explain, we can cook your regex in more better way..
[22:42:38] <re101-lynx-10> it's hard to be clear... but the regex will be diferent for diferent files with diferent formats
[22:43:08] <re101-lynx-10> so i need to "cook" the pattern by watching the header (the Tuples you saw above)
[22:44:05] <purplex> first we'll try cooking something general and then we can adjust it to your taste
[22:44:58] <re101-lynx-10> so for a tuple ("name","1") -> this is just a word (\w+) but for a ("name","3") it's 3 collums separated by commas with words
[22:46:43] <re101-lynx-10> for a ("name","2","5") it's between 2 to 5 collums separated by commas with at least 2 numbers to max of 5 numbers
[22:47:29] <re101-lynx-10> for a ("name","2","5","sum") it's between 2 to 5 collums separated by commas with at least 2 numbers to max of 5 numbers that you sum them all and return the result
[22:47:35] <purplex> more sure what am i doing here: https://regex101.com/r/bltGkY/2 
[22:47:53] <purplex> need to be more sure*
[22:51:31] <re101-lynx-10> the problem is i don't know what the format will be... i need to look at the file just then i can create a pattern
[22:53:57] <re101-lynx-10> there are only 5 cases (normal field ,normal with x fields, normal with between x to y fields,normal with x fields and function to process the fields, normal with between x to y fields and a function to process the fields)
[22:54:14] <purplex> okay, so you are trying python to generate a pattern
[22:54:21] <re101-lynx-10> exactly
[22:56:02] <re101-lynx-10> the function part is killing me cause i don't know how (or even if) i can call it over the data
[22:56:10] <purplex> does it feel to you more like a python problem than regex? (i mean if you are aware of \w \d, etc. but not sure how to generate a pattern in python?)
[22:57:04] <re101-lynx-10> yes, i did some patterns now, but they don't seem to work 0.o

[22:59:42] <purplex> we can help you with regex, but for python it may need special attention to look at your code (i'd do it if i had more time to debug it) you can also try #python to find more python users
