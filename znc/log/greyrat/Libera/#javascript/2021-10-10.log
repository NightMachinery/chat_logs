[03:14:01] <KDev> But, the NPM package they use is depreciated, and I'm wondering if I should still use it, or if I can use modern JS fetch to do the same thing, or maybe even use Axios.

[03:26:18] <ljharb> KDev: request is fine, node-fetch or axios is fine.
[03:26:44] <KDev> is node fetch different from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch ?
[03:26:59] <pavonia> When you dynamically load a CSS stylesheet via <link>, is there a way to check if the given href could be found?

[23:05:56] <tokam> Hi, I know parsing HTML with regex is not recommended. I had the problem that I got matches also within HTML tags. I found a solution (link will be posted). An so added this infront of my regex (?<!<[^>]*)
[23:06:05] <tokam> It works, but I do not fully understand yet why it works ...
[23:06:11] <tokam> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48227882/regex-excluding-matches-contained-within-a-html-tag
[23:06:58] <tokam> What does the ? at the beginning of the regex do?
[23:07:15] <tokam> is it starting a negative lookahead?
[23:07:23] <shan> it's the beginning of a lookbehind
[23:07:31] <shan> negative lookbehind to be specific
[23:07:49] <tokam> https://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html
[23:08:02] <tokam> ahh so this starts the assertion (?<!

[23:10:37] <tokam> so it means I match everything that is not preceded by an html tag (opening and closing) that is not completed yet

[23:52:00] <Slade> well standards are important
[23:55:28] <ThePendulum> ljharb: I can imagine one hour into Full Bridge Rectumfriers you find it hard to imagine any standards were involved
[23:56:20] <Slade> its interesting about osha standards since they dont really apply to having less than 15 employees
[23:57:46] <systemfault> The people at ECMA don't work?
[23:58:03] <ThePendulum> guess they may only come around for bigger networks that directly own multiple studios, although getting 15 employees onto 1 set is not unthinkable. not sure how they count freelance/contract workers
[23:58:19] <systemfault> Just saying that I can view the ES standard anytime I want without having to pay....
