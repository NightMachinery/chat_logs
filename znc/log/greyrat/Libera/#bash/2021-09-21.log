[03:56:58] <kurahaupo> Depending on which state, "plant" may rhyme with either "ant" or "aunt"
[03:57:30] <greycat> and in most of the US, "ant" and "aunt" are pronounced the same

[03:59:25] <greycat> not sure what that phrase is... cot and caught are *not* pronounced the same in my part of the US

[04:16:20] <kurahaupo> ljharb: No "gaunt" doesn't rhyme with "aunt"
[04:16:32] <ljharb> (in my part of the US "ant" and "aunt" both rhyme with "gantt", but i say "aunty" like "gaunt-y")
[04:16:47] <ljharb> kurahaupo: it does to some people who pronounce "aunt" like "aw-nt"
[04:17:06] <ljharb> i'm hoping that "gaunt" is always pronounced the same way, ofc, otherwise that's a dumb example
[04:17:56] <kurahaupo> It's difficult to find example words to show vowel differences, because most of them use "r" as a silent marker which fails badly when explaining to someone with a rhotic accent
[04:18:43] <Friithian> I don't understand what any of that is, IPA plox
[04:18:47] <ljharb> unfortunately i can never remember how IPA works
[04:19:17] <ljharb> ok so, the last name of the grateful dead drummer "robert plant" is the same pronunciation i expect for "plant" and "ant", and regionally "aunt"
[04:19:19] <Friithian> https://www.ipachart.com/
[04:19:31] <kurahaupo> For me "gaunt" & "flaunt" rhymes with "lawn 't" but "aunt" rhymes with "barn 't" (with a silent r)
[04:19:39] <ljharb> but in other regions, "aunt" is pronounced like ("gaunt" and "taunt" which are both pronounced the same)
[04:20:11] <ljharb> kurahaupo: ah, ok, that's confusing to me; gaunt/flaunt/taunt/aunt in other parts of the US are all pronounced like "lawn 't'" to me
[04:20:13] <greycat> *nod* I think aunt can be pronounced "ant" or "awnt" or "ahnt"

[04:30:07] <ljharb> if so it seems like the AU one is similar to the british one, but a bit more drawn out
[04:30:26] <kurahaupo> yes that's pretty accurate
[04:32:54] <kurahaupo> not quite as rounded as the British one, but clearly different from the US one (which is how we would say "ant" or "plant" (for most of us). However I'm pretty sure I've heard some US speakers "aunt" more like the AU or UK rendition

[07:46:57] <greybot> xargs(1) is dangerous (broken, exploitable, etc.) when reading non-NUL-delimited input. If you're working with filenames, use find's -exec [command] {} + instead. If you can get NUL-delimited output, use xargs -0. Otherwise, you probably want a while read or for loop instead.

[07:58:23] <earendel> well. just always validate user data. pushing it into some parser is of course risky. but you should consider the code being obfuscated to trick restrictions. so at least check its length the fuck.

[17:30:09] <Soliton> how is memory capacity relevant for how often you can run a loop?

[17:35:00] <rapha> hi all!
[17:35:34] <rapha> is it possible to say "ls everything in this directory, but only if it doesn't end in a dot followed by some other stuff" by using a pattern, i.e. no "if"? e.g., if there's "myfile" and "foobar" and "myfile.txt" and "foobar.blah" i only wanna see "myfile" and "foobar"...
[17:35:54] <Soliton> !extglob
[17:35:54] <greybot> "Extended globs" (shopt -s extglob) allow you to say things like "all files that do not end in .jpg". See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/glob#extglob
[17:36:11] <Soliton> if you really want to iterate files then don't use ls at all.
[17:36:38] <rapha> ls was just as an example, Soliton
