[02:14:50] <FruttiTutti> hi everyone!
[02:14:59] <merpnderp> I starting moving from MacOS to Ubuntu and it has been incredible. Can't believe what I was missing out on.
[02:15:14] <onelegend> FruttiTutti: helloo human
[02:15:22] <FruttiTutti> i have a small question: how come that when i am booting in linux, i can access my whole windows partition without any password?
[02:15:31] <onelegend> yup
[02:15:38] <FruttiTutti> isnt that super unsafe?
[02:15:40] <onelegend> unless you have bitlocker on
[02:16:15] <FruttiTutti> but i mean... is that always like that?
[02:16:25] <sarnold> FruttiTutti: the linux kernel just parses the ntfs filesystem; it doesn't know how to use the windows user/password database to figure out which users should be allowed to do what, etc
[02:16:29] <FruttiTutti> so unless its encrypted, anyone can just access it?
[02:16:29] <onelegend> if your windows partition is not encrypted, anyone will be able to see your entire partition simply by taking your SSD or HDD out and plugging it back in
[02:16:32] <onelegend> yes
[02:16:36] <onelegend> that applies for anything
[02:16:56] <FruttiTutti> interesting... thanks for clearing that up!
[02:16:58] <sarnold> FruttiTutti: yeah, back in 1997 or something, I had a linux floppy disk that could reset the system administrator password on windows NT machines. it was the single most useful tool we had at that company :)

[02:17:47] <FruttiTutti> so really the easiest way to bypass any security on windows is simply to use a live version of linux?
[02:18:03] <sarnold> hoppity: not in an easy one-liner, no, but you can go through /var/log/apt.log and find the packages that way

[02:21:30] <sarnold> FruttiTutti: no, you're using basically the same web browser on both systems. no real difference.
[02:22:15] <FruttiTutti> sarnold: but then why do people say that a live version of linux is a safer way to go than just using a normal install?

[06:23:20] <pycurious> In your machine - https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/Dmthd87Fhk/ - the ssh service starts at 29ms, but clearly its not active and started at that point. How do I find out when is it ready for connections?

[11:16:23] <TechMonk_> You can modify the shell prompt to display the time also.

[14:47:14] <TJ-> ikonia: finally worked around that this morning by pushing the source up to my bug-fixes PPA and installing the packages from that (amd64 and i386 built in PPA) and that causes a local /usr/share/doc/$PACKAGE/changelog* conflict. Was trying to use --force-all to override that

[15:46:53] <oldgalileo> ikonia: How could you reasonable unmount recursively without making the bind mount a slave?
[15:46:57] <oldgalileo> *reasonably
[15:47:13] <ikonia> what do you mean making it a slave ?
[15:47:18] <ikonia> mounts are just a tree

[15:47:29] <fukawi2> Hello all... I have a fun one that I've spent the last 5 hours on. We have 2 identical 20.04 hosts acting as firewalls (active/standby using ucarp).  One of these hosts has stopped renaming the network interfaces after a reboot this afternoon - all interfaces are now just the old ethX style,  instead of ens9fX for the 10g nics, and ens5fX for the 100g nics. The misbahving host accidentally got upgraded to kernel 5.4.0-80-generic.  Running `
[15:47:29] <fukawi2> udevmdm` in debug mode gives me this error: "eth7: Failed to query name_assign_type: Invalid argument eth7: Policies didn't yield a name and Name= is not given, not renaming." and indeed I am unable to read that file in /sys (same "Invalid argument" error). Rebooting into kernel 5.4.0-65-generic makes everything work again. Anything I can do to fix, or should I report as a bug?

[16:27:08] <oldgalileo> ikonia: Setting up a bind mount to be a slave will limit the propagation of mount events within the bind to be not bi-directional
[16:27:28] <ikonia> what do you mean by slave ?
[16:27:35] <ikonia> it doesn't make sense why you keep saying 'slave'
[16:27:37] <ikonia> there is no slave
[16:27:41] <oldgalileo> ikonia: mount --make-slave
[16:27:42] <ikonia> it's just a mount point of an existing resource
[16:27:50] <oldgalileo> You can make a slave
[16:28:17] <oldgalileo> So you can do mount --bind --make-slave and this will enforce the behavior I just described above
[16:28:33] <ikonia> but that's because you 'want' that behaviour

[19:34:54] <alkisg> shailangsa: a plain user can't create dirs directly under /home. If you want to create a /home/shared for all users, and share group permissions etc, or a /home/photos writeable by one user and readable for others, sure, you can
[19:35:09] <alkisg> So to create these dirs you'd use sudo mkdir, chmod etc

[21:44:15] <Samian> I wonder why rm is not used?
[21:44:37] <hob60> TJ- I don't remember doing that but it is possible I used to power button at some point. Since the smart check thinks the disk is OK (actually now it says "OK - 2 bad sectors") do you think it is safe to reinstall to this same disk?
[21:45:17] <ioria> hob60, check dmesg ; paste it, if you want
[21:45:18] <TJ-> hob60: well, '2 bad sectors' might be a sign that something is going wrong. First thing I'd do is back-up any valuable data and configurations
[21:46:45] <TJ-> hob60: look at the SMART data carefully; especially pending sector/reallocated sector counts
[21:46:54] <hob60> TJ- yeah code for my project is all pushed. I only installed a couple weeks ago so not much to back up
[21:47:25] <hob60> ioria I don't know how to read dmesg but there is a lot of red and no timestamps. Will try to make a paste
[21:47:37] <TJ-> hob60: things you might forget like GPG and SSH configs and keys in $HOME, or package-specific configs under /etc/

[21:55:29] <TJ-> hob60: it looks like a connection issue since most of the hardware errors are ATA bus
[21:55:36] <hob60> TJ- I get the feeling it is barely running right now.... lots of slowdowns
[21:55:42] <hob60> TJ- OK that is hopeful then
[21:56:24] <ioria> hob60,   run   'sudo    journalctl --verify    '   but usually it fixes itself
[21:56:38] <hob60> TJ- but since the corruption has already happened is the install probably doomed anyway?
[21:57:38] <TJ-> hob60: well, "dpkg --verify" didn't look bad, so it may only be limited to files under /var/ like logs and so on so recoverable. Fix the cabling if that is it, then worry about fixing the data :)
