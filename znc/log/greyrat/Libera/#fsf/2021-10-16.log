[06:57:26] <jxself> The real problem is trying to think of one as being a a subset of the other. It's really one movement (the free software movement) and a difference in philosophy, not in the freedom provided: https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.en.

[07:51:58] <jxself> I've not used Sieve yet so any information I could provide would just come from looking up stuff online. :)
[07:52:10] <jxself> My machine still uses the aging procmail. And real, actual users.
[07:52:31] <jxself> Because I know everyone that uses the machine and they're trusted or would not have access.
[07:54:03] <tpefreedom> Is there any attempt to port its to x86/amd64?
[07:54:47] <jxself> Not that I know of. That would be a lot of work and not trivial. At all.
[07:57:32] <jxself> But you could run it in an emulator on GNU/Linux and "just" think of the emulator and GNU/Linux and whatnot as being nothing more than the "bootloader" of sorts to start ITS. How's that? :)

[10:20:38] <rber> yes, the same for power supply, though that one is more common :P
[10:21:03] <rber> but you can stay some time out of network and still don't lose mail right
[10:22:05] <DiffieHellman> Yes, e-mail servers tend to retry for a few hours.
[10:22:43] <DiffieHellman> Drop outs are a massive pain, but you're good to go if you have 1 minute dropouts a few times a day for example.
[10:26:17] <dragestil>  i have outages for about 15 minutes sometimes
[10:26:41] <rber> yeah, I don't remember from where that number comes from but around 6 hours? :P
[10:26:48] <rber> after that they will not get
[10:26:51] <rber> there
[10:26:53] <dragestil> that's good with the mails
[10:26:58] <dragestil> but how about irc?
[10:27:44] <dragestil> i'm with a top tier isp in australia btw, it's the nbn that sucks 
[10:28:16] <dragestil> s/top tier/decent/ :P
[10:29:39] <dragestil> power outage seems nonexistent here
[10:29:58] <rber> irc can survive if your connection survives, if something breaks the connection (server, network hardware, client, whatever) then you might lose messages
[10:30:12] <rber> or probably will
[10:30:36] <rber> at least libera, some other servers have some history playback already enable
[10:30:47] <dragestil> but if i rely on localhost only, then i'll lose all irc messages during outages
[10:30:50] <rber> d
[10:31:01] <rber> yes
[10:31:06] <rber> you mean long outages
[10:31:24] <rber> 15 minutes is survivable if nothing breaks the connection
[10:31:27] <dragestil> no i mean any length
[10:32:02] <dragestil> say i lost internet connection for 1 minute, then i won't recover irc messages during this minute
[10:32:21] <rber> you might
[10:32:27] <dragestil> how?
[10:32:47] <rber> as long as the connection doesn't break
[10:33:00] <dragestil> what does that mean
[10:34:00] <rber> sometimes your client disconnects from the servers and you have to reconnect
[10:34:38] <rber> but as long as that doesn't happen you won't lose any messages
[10:35:11] <rber> well, Idk, probably the server may drop messages if your receive too many in that period
[10:36:02] <dragestil> i don't understand.  if i lose connection to the internet, then my client will automatically disconnect from the servers, no?
[10:36:17] *** Joins: RISCi_ATOM (~nynex@librecmc.org)

[13:40:36] <jackdk> xloem[m]: the trick is that you need to get there first, otherwise people will just route around your GPL library. It's got to be novel and compelling enough that people don't just go use something else. Example: look at how long libgmp/mpfr have survived (LGPL, I know, but still)

[13:41:54] <jackdk> for ML specifically, ISTM that there's an additional problem: the code's no good on its own if you don't have the training data and the resources to train the model. GPL has barely kept up with the network world, unfortunately.
[13:48:38] <xloem[m]> there are a lot of resources in ML that could make a new library compelling.  multiple new things released every week, but generally with web demos and jupyter notebooks the only way to use them, minimal library integration.
[13:48:38] <xloem[m]> another approach could be getting researchers on board with the tools.  people use what the researchers use because it is easier and faster.
[13:48:38] <xloem[m]> but making a neural network lib is a lot of work and learning; I personally am quite new to these things.  if there's no existing codebase I wonder if relicensing a permissively-licensed codebase is a thing?
[13:48:38] <xloem[m]> another thing that might be missing is an interface that unifies the existing ones, letting the user swap them out

[20:14:30] <xloem[m]> * there are a lot of resources in ML that could make a new library compelling.  multiple new things released every week/month, but generally with web demos and jupyter notebooks the only way to use them, minimal library integration. [edit: added /month since i'm encountering more new things because I am new myself]
[20:14:31] <xloem[m]> another approach could be getting researchers on board with the tools.  people use what the researchers use because it is easier and faster.
[20:14:31] <xloem[m]> but making a neural network lib is a lot of work and learning; I personally am quite new to these things.  if there's no existing codebase I wonder if relicensing a permissively-licensed codebase is a thing?
[20:14:31] <xloem[m]> another thing that might be missing is an interface that unifies the existing ones, letting the user swap them out

[21:58:54] <joshaspinall> @tpefreedom One of the libre laptops is a good start (such as an X200), depending on your requirements and skill level
[22:02:20] <joshaspinall> usually a case of getting anything supported on https://libreboot.org/
[22:09:02] <tpefreedom> i think I'll try it on an old laptop I have lying around and then upgrade to something else later if it works.
