[03:59:41] <LTCD> Hey, if I am using DES with a 64-bit message space, 56-bit key, if I compute a MAC tag t = DES_k(m) why is this insecure even though we are using a PRF? 
[04:00:55] <sarnold> snappy: hmm... so, is a labor day sale that knocked the price in half enough to entice me to get the book? :) I'm hoping to find a good crypto book recommendation for beginners, but my To Read stack is growing to silly sizes at this point
[04:01:07] <LTCD> I would assume because the output space is only 64-bit, so you could easily iterate over every possible tag until one is valid?

[04:20:14] <Alipha> LTCD: by creating a MAC from DES, do you mean using CBC-MAC? If so, there's length extension attacks on it, as illustrated by https://cryptopals.com/sets/7/challenges/49
[04:20:56] <Alipha> CBC-MAC can be secure with fixed-length messages, I believe, but you really should just avoid it anyway
[04:21:57] <Alipha> LTCD: also, yes, a 64-bit MAC is too short. If you captured/produced 2^32 messages, there's a 50% chance that two of those messages would have the same MAC
[04:23:16] <LTCD> Alipha Sadly the question did not specify, however if you can find an easy attack DES MAC is vulnerable to before I continue I would be grateful. 
[04:23:25] <ericonr> Alipha: why isn't it 2^63?
[04:24:00] <LTCD> Alipha Oh wait, it did not define an output space, just an input space of 2^64, is that still a problem?
[04:24:03] <Alipha> ericonr: birthday paradox.
[04:24:06] <sarnold> https://sweet32.info/
[04:25:09] <ericonr> huh, thanks
[04:26:01] <sarnold> (perhaps not a perfect explanation, but firefox showed it to me when I was trying to load the wikipedia page for the birthday paradox and it looked plausibly better than I remember of the wikipedia page, hehe :)
[04:26:56] <ericonr> hehe, it works as a starting point

[04:38:58] <Alipha> So, this isn't going to be that close to 50%, since it involves small numbers, but say you picked a number from 1 to 9 three times, which is the birthday paradox. For a collision, you have 11x, 22x, 33x, etc. So that's 9*9, or 81, possibilities. You could also have collisions on 1x1 and x11, so that's another 162, for a total of 243. However, we've counted 111, 222, etc each three times instead of the one
[04:39:00] <Alipha> time we should have, so subtract 18, which is 225 possible combinations that there's a collision. So the odds of a collision is 225/(9^3) or 30.8%, which is much higher than 1 out of 9^3/2 (which is 0.14%)
[04:40:16] <LTCD> Alipha But the  message space {0, 1}^64 means the input, not the output tag?
[04:42:49] <Alipha> LTCD: if you're encrypting just a single block and using that as a tag, then there's no possibility for collision, nor length extension, so your security level is 56 bits, the length of the key.
[04:46:53] <LTCD> Alipha Sadly, my question did not specify.
[04:55:33] <LTCD> Alipha You must make a MAC for message space {0,1}^(64) like this: k chosen as random 56-bit string. Tag on m is worked out as t=DES_k(m). Verify the output (m,t) by recomputing the tag. In general, you can use a PRF when making a secure MAC, however what was described here is insecure... why?

[05:01:31] <LTCD> Alipha Now I have rephrased the question, is your message above "So this isn't going to be that close to 50%" still applicable as the attack the question is referring to? Sorry, I have a lot of self doubt haha.
[05:07:12] <Alipha> LTCD: the "not close to 50%" was referring to the birthday paradox involving selecting 3 numbers from a set of 9
[05:07:30] <Alipha> So it's not relevant. That was meant for ericonr
[05:07:46] *** Joins: machinedgod (~machinedg@135.23.192.217)
[05:07:55] <Alipha> LTCD: I can't tell you why they say that MAC is insecure.
[05:08:04] <LTCD> Alipha For my answer I wrote: The message space {0,1}^(64) is too short and is vulnerable to a Birthday Attack, in which a collision will occur in 2^(n/2) which is 2^32.
[05:08:18] <Alipha> That's not true
[05:08:31] <LTCD> Oh.
[05:09:50] <Alipha> A message of {0,1}^64 would be 64 bits, ie, a single DES block. Which there's NO collision possible because DES is a permutation
[05:10:07] <ericonr> Alipha: oops I hadn't noticed it either
[05:10:13] <LTCD> Alipha If you have a moment please message me privately, just so I can sent an exact copy of this. I agree with your observations entirely, but worry my rewording skills are failing me.
[05:11:18] <ericonr> Alipha: just to confirm, for 4 numbers the collisions could be 1xx1, right?
[05:11:34] <ericonr> it's 2 entries the same and the rest can be whatever
[05:15:17] <Alipha> ericonr: right, 11xx, 1x1x, 1xx1, x11x, x1x1, xx11.
[05:15:52] <LTCD> Alipha I PMed you.

[17:27:54] <dostoyevsky2> I've always wondered how block-ciphers work where you e.g. encrypt a filesystem...  so you kind of have to align your en/decryption in a ways that allows to open random blocks in your filesystem and still use the keys in the same way....  I studied OpenBSD's encrypted filesystems for a while but never got the gist of it
[17:29:33] <Haohmaru> aren't filesystems already block-based?
[17:29:50] <Haohmaru> iirc on some particular OS, an empty file took 4KB
[17:30:22] <dostoyevsky2> yeah... did I imply they are not block based?
[17:30:35] <Haohmaru> no idea
[17:31:11] <Haohmaru> well you'd probably encrypt each of these blocks individually so that you can decrypt individually later, in whatever order
[17:31:15] <Haohmaru> or am i missing something?
[17:31:19] <riv> yeah FDE is pretty involved
[17:31:28] <dostoyevsky2> I'd assume you take a password and then expand it to some key that aligns with the blocksizes... and then mod the block id into that key
[17:32:23] <dostoyevsky2> Haohmaru: or individually with each key...  hmm...
[17:32:29] *** Joins: softpaw (~softpaw@185.162.184.11)
[17:32:47] <dostoyevsky2> each with the password even
[17:33:53] <dostoyevsky2> but do encryption methods always ensure that the input size equals the output size?  Pretty guarantee to have for a filesystem
[17:34:04] <dostoyevsky2> + important
[17:34:34] <Haohmaru> block ciphers work on blocks
[17:34:53] <Haohmaru> their output size is.. what it is
[17:35:07] <Haohmaru> for AES-128 it's 128bit, you can't change it
[17:35:32] <dostoyevsky2> if you feed a block of data to a non-block cipher it also outputs a block, no?
[17:35:44] <Haohmaru> but surely you can encrypt a 4KB chunk of data with AES-128 bit because the magic of powers of two ;P~

[17:39:01] <Haohmaru> even if the data size was some awkward number, block ciphers (like AES) can be used in different modes, you can use a block cipher to make it work like a stream cipher
[17:39:15] <Haohmaru> and then you can encrypt byte by byte if you want
[17:39:29] <Haohmaru> or i guess, bit by bit even, if that's your thing
[17:39:53] <Haohmaru> just mind the rules

[18:28:04] <Alipha> dostoyevsky2: AES-XTS is often used for disk encryption, where the sector number is combined with the master encryption key to create per-sector keys. There's also Google's Adiantum, which is a more secure, novel disk encryption algorithm, which I would hope would gain more traction: https://security.googleblog.com/2019/02/introducing-adiantum-encryption-for.html?m=1
[18:32:28] <piou> hiya: yep, go with sha256, it's nice, since it's a hmac anyway even md5 would be fine, there's no reason to get fancy

[18:44:16] <hiya> piou: ok thanks
[18:44:28] <MacGyver> Nothing in the list you mentioned could be considered overkill.
[18:44:57] <dostoyevsky2> Alipha: Yeah, if you encrypt a FS based on sectors with always the same password, it also means that you still can recognize the file system structure just from repeating block patterns... so adding the sector number makes sense
[18:45:26] <hiya> piou: so the standard secure_link module that uses md5 is fine too?
[18:46:00] <dostoyevsky2> but just plain: "password" + string(sector_number) doesn't feel very secure :)
[18:47:05] <MacGyver> I'd personally argue for a 512-bit hmac if you have the budget for it and if it is a decision that won't be easy to revisit; hardware-support wise I don't know whether it's that common to have SHA-instructions, but they *are* in the ARM instruction set.
