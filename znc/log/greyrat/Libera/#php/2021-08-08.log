[00:02:36] <biberu> isn't that one of those pointy clicky things?
[00:03:45] <biberu> Simplar: the response to your preflight is 404, it should be 2xx
[00:05:55] <Simplar> biberu: where does the problem lie then? The server?
[00:06:15] <biberu> the server should respond with a 200 to the preflight (your OPTIONS)
[00:11:36] <biberu> Simplar: https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-preflight-fetch
[00:11:48] <biberu> see step 7
[00:12:30] <biberu> and here's ok status codes: https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#ok-status
[00:13:07] <biberu> Simplar: my guess is that you don't have route configured for the preflight
[00:13:19] <Simplar> Through express-php?
[00:13:21] <biberu> +a
[00:13:29] <biberu> i don't know what that is
[00:13:46] <Simplar> Ah, that's just a route generator in node.js style
[00:13:47] <biberu> you need something to respond to that request
[00:14:06] *** Joins: CyberCr33p (~chris@bnc.cretaforce.gr)
[00:14:26] <da_wunder> Simplar: that - https://prnt.sc/1klnfrk - is showing 404 - so maybe your backend doesn't accept OPTIONS requests at all...
[00:15:17] <Simplar> Ohhh
[00:15:26] <Simplar> So I also need OPTIONS route for every POST route?
[00:16:02] <biberu> you need something that handles options requests
[00:16:26] <biberu> how you do that depends
[00:16:26] <da_wunder> usually those are done by some middleware or similar - we don't know what framework (if any) you're using so quite hard to say...
[00:17:58] <biberu> Simplar: you could start with simply adding an options companion to that post to see if it solves your immediate issue, then have a think on how to structure the rest of your application
[00:21:57] *** Joins: harpia (~harpia@58.148.205.168.dynamic.vibefibra.com.br)
[00:24:02] <da_wunder> Simplar: and if you're using some framework, that issue might be already solved - just search it from that framework repository
[00:25:10] <Simplar> https://github.com/aeberdinelli/express-php using that thing
[00:25:40] <da_wunder> Simplar: eg. for Symfony there is this bundle that I have used in several projects - https://github.com/nelmio/NelmioCorsBundle
[00:26:44] <da_wunder> Simplar: so try to search with "cors" on that repository and if there isn't any results create an issue about that
[00:27:36] <da_wunder> Simplar: although that seems like dead repository for me - no updated for a long time
[00:30:50] <biberu> they are even advicing against using it
[00:32:32] <da_wunder> let me guess, you have earlier worked with node.js and some express based framework - and you decide to use that just because it's "the same" that you have earlier used?
[00:33:08] <biberu> js is the gift that keeps on hurting
[00:33:21] <da_wunder> if that is yes - I really recommend you to look PHP frameworks like Symfony, Laravel, Yii, etc.

[01:05:21] <Simplar> da_wunder: so yes.
[01:08:19] <da_wunder> Simplar: so then I would really recommend you to use some maintained framework instead of something that has not been updated in ages...
[01:09:01] <Simplar> Which php router would you recommend?
[01:09:18] <da_wunder> Simplar: and with eg. Symfony I can say making cors setup is really trivial and most likely with other popular frameworks too
[01:09:46] <Simplar> However, my frontend is built on React, and I thought Laravel or Symfony would be overkill
[01:09:52] <da_wunder> if you use some framework, those are usually included to those already
[01:10:19] <da_wunder> why?
[01:10:42] <da_wunder> you could just build a rest api with those both that your react frontend uses
[01:10:44] <Simplar> Oh wait, Symfony and Laravel can be configured API-only?
[01:11:27] <da_wunder> sure, why not - I have used Symfony like that for years...
[01:14:07] <Simplar> Alright! I'll follow the advice
[01:14:14] <Simplar> Thank you for it
[01:14:31] <da_wunder> with php it's really just a request and response - your application can send what ever you need in that response
[01:15:08] <Simplar> Whoa wait
[01:15:14] <Simplar> Those frameworks even handle--
[01:15:19] <Simplar> --the edge cases
[01:16:36] <da_wunder> Simplar: you should look this - https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/symfonycon2019/building-really-fast-applications - nice presentation from Tobias

[01:50:35] <harpia> Simplar, there's an option when creating a new Symfony project that lets you start with a bare minimal skeleton project if that's what you need.
[01:51:12] <da_wunder> ^ and that is what I recommend to use
[01:52:04] <Simplar> Why Symfony over Laravel?
[01:52:29] <da_wunder> you should try those both - imho
[01:53:40] <da_wunder> I prefer Symfony more because it doesn't have so much "magic" than Laravel and it won't restrict you to use some specified architecture
[01:54:03] <da_wunder> but really try those both and make _your_ own decision
[01:54:45] <da_wunder> and also remember that there are other frameworks that you could use - just try those out and make _your_ own decision what you like most
[01:59:28] <Nomikos> I found https://symfony.com/doc/current/create_framework/index.html a very useful read
[02:03:24] <da_wunder> yeah, that doc series is really usefully

[04:30:52] <da_wunder> huoh, your $html is just a string...
[04:31:56] <crazyfrog> :) what do you mean? what should i do?
[04:32:16] <da_wunder> you're initializing that first with $html = ''; and after that $html = file_get_contents($fetchurl); - have you looked what that file_get_contents returns...
[04:32:43] <crazyfrog> no
[04:32:54] <Blondie101010> yes you did with var_dump()
[04:33:04] <crazyfrog> ah ok
[04:33:15] <crazyfrog> ok thnaks i will try it
[04:33:37] <Blondie101010> you should look for examples that use your favorite DOM solution
[04:35:36] <crazyfrog> $html should not be a string?

[04:42:49] *** Quits: Poboy (~Poboy@user/poboy) (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[04:46:53] <Byteflux> crazyfrog: The error is fairly straight forward. It means you're calling the method (member function) named "find" on a string. Strings aren't objects in PHP, so they don't have member functions (methods).
[04:47:11] <Byteflux> The line number should tell you where the call to find() is.
[04:47:51] <da_wunder> it's shown on that paste - https://paste.debian.net/hidden/d4d71451/
[04:47:56] <mysteryhunter> https://youtu.be/OLfyaXBEw7k
[04:48:25] <Byteflux> Yeah, there you go. So $html is a string. You can't call find() on a string.
[04:48:54] <crazyfrog> ok
[04:49:33] <da_wunder> as like the error message is telling...
[04:49:42] <Blondie101010> so like I said, you need to use a DOM parser
[04:49:54] <Blondie101010> though a simple string search could be possible
[04:50:07] <Blondie101010> that's not usually recommended
[04:50:09] <Byteflux> The error message does imply you understand what a member function is, some people might not. But now you do :)

[08:36:39] <wfpkhc> your guess is as good as mine
[08:36:53] <tw2113> given how little code we've seen, yes we're all guessing here :P
[08:37:01] <wfpkhc> yes its a switch to decide which function to use to generate the page inside the index.php
[08:37:22] <Blondie101010> looks very disorganized, but what is the real problem?
[08:37:22] <wfpkhc> trust me - its not my code and i would have scrapped the whole thing
[08:37:39] <wfpkhc> the real problem is the $_REQUEST - i dont know where it would be set
[08:37:50] <Blondie101010> if $_REQUEST['ps'] isn't set, I suppose it gives the default page
[08:37:59] <wfpkhc> i found this documentation
[08:38:00] <Blondie101010> what?
[08:38:12] <wfpkhc> the website is still running on 5.X https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.request.php
[08:38:18] <Blondie101010> not sure where you get stuck
[08:38:33] <Blondie101010> $_REQUEST is basically $_GET + $_POST + $_COOKIE
[08:38:45] <wfpkhc> @blondie - yes if the ps is not set - it has a default page - which works
[08:38:55] <Blondie101010> so what is the problem?
[08:39:03] <wfpkhc> but when you click on any link, the page shows a 404 -
[08:39:13] <wfpkhc> but if i add ?ps=gettingstarted
[08:39:19] <wfpkhc> to the link - the pages work
[08:39:38] <Blondie101010> their code that you're looking at (not me) is doing that
[08:39:58] <wfpkhc> yes i am aware of that
[08:40:02] <Byteflux> you should maybe ask your friend what changes they made to either the code or the environment upon inheriting it which caused it to break, presumable it was working before.
[08:40:03] <tw2113> it could be as basic as of hidden field
[08:40:03] <Blondie101010> and of course if you choose the page based on that parameter and don't specify it, then you can expect a failure
[08:40:23] <Byteflux> could be a web server rewrite rule missing or something
[08:40:31] <wfpkhc> @ Byteflux - yes it was working before - it was an upgrade from 5.1 to 5.2
[08:40:42] <Blondie101010> ohhhhhhhhhhhh
[08:40:51] <wfpkhc> but that should not have broken it - i told him he might be missing a mod_rewrite
[08:41:03] <wfpkhc> because i have NEVER seen anything written like this
[08:41:53] <Blondie101010> you sure it's not PHP 5.3 or 5.4?
[08:42:04] <wfpkhc> let me check
[08:42:10] <Byteflux> based on the current information i'd guess it's a mod_rewrite related thing, specifically an improper or missing rule.
[08:42:30] <Byteflux> assuming the /<pagename> should be ?ps=<pagename>
[08:42:36] <Blondie101010> we got only 2 lines of PHP code so we don't know
[08:43:05] <wfpkhc> 5.4.45
[08:43:43] <Blondie101010> my first guess would be that the crappy code relies on register_globals
[08:46:25] <tw2113> that's some legacy code, from the sounds of it
[08:46:32] <wfpkhc> here is some code
[08:46:32] <wfpkhc> https://dpaste.org/MgTP
[08:46:46] <wfpkhc> yes it does rely heavily on globals
[08:46:51] <wfpkhc> ITS NOT MY CODE
[08:46:53] <wfpkhc> :D
[08:46:58] <wfpkhc> dont hate me
[08:46:59] <tw2113> we got that
[08:47:03] <tw2113> we don't hate you yet
[08:47:13] <Blondie101010> ok so what is the problem again?
[08:47:37] <wfpkhc> im just trying to help out a not profit, ...if you dont hate me yet, i will have to work harder, the dark side of the force wants that ! *breaths like darth vader*
[08:47:55] <Blondie101010> stop and give useful information
[08:48:13] <wfpkhc> <li' . $menu['aboutus'] . '><a href="' . $GLOBALS['http_root'] . 'aboutus" title="About Us">About Us</a></li>
[08:48:25] <wfpkhc> that is an example of the main menu of the website
[08:48:30] <Blondie101010> so?
[08:48:35] <wfpkhc> as you can see no /?ps=
[08:49:01] <wfpkhc> if i put that , the site works, so i am not sure where the ['ps'] is being set
[08:49:20] <wfpkhc> i dont use mod_rewrite if that is being used, so im not sure
[08:49:43] <Blondie101010> it could be but you faked the URL so I'm not sure
[08:49:58] <Blondie101010> but it does sound like a mod_rewrite or similar change
[08:50:09] <Blondie101010> so you didn't only update PHP, did you?
[08:50:31] <wfpkhc> it wasnt me - it was a friend in canada, im in Australia
[08:50:33] *** Joins: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky)
[08:50:47] <Byteflux> goes back to what i was saying
[08:50:47] <Blondie101010> very useful information
[08:50:50] <Byteflux> ask them what they changed
[08:50:51] <Byteflux> everything
[08:50:57] <Byteflux> seems like they maybe changed the webserver too
[08:50:58] *** Joins: Rockwood_ (~Rocky@user/rocky)
[08:51:04] <wfpkhc> they did change the webserver
[08:51:18] <Byteflux> well great, if you messed up the mod_rewrite settings, that could explain what you're seeing
[08:51:19] <wfpkhc> and we have updated the httpdocs from http_public
[08:51:24] <Blondie101010> well they should look at their previous http config
[08:51:35] <wfpkhc> the previous server has mod_Rewrite
[08:51:39] <wfpkhc> because they sent me screenshots
[08:51:42] <Blondie101010> it probably rewrote something to ps=something
[08:51:47] <wfpkhc> ok
[08:51:55] <Byteflux> right, that's what im guessing the old settings did
[08:52:20] <wfpkhc> yes - *mumbles and grumbles dirty things about people who use mod_rewrite*
[08:52:23] <wfpkhc> thank you all
[08:52:30] <wfpkhc> i appreciate the help...

[13:12:57] <paule32> hello
[13:13:14] <paule32> how can i read dynamic multiple lines from stdin
[13:13:16] <paule32> ?
[13:13:42] <paule32> so, i have program a, and program b, program b should read the output of program a
[13:16:55] <TinoDidriksen> A program doesn't care what is piped in.
[13:17:00] <TinoDidriksen> Just read from stdin.
[13:17:18] <paule32> in a loop?
[13:17:35] <TinoDidriksen> Sure, if that makes sense for the format.
[13:18:39] <TinoDidriksen> But whether you do program-a | program-b, or cat file | program-b, or echo '...' | program-b ... the program-b doesn't know or care what is before the |. It just reads stdin.
[13:20:04] <paule32> also a one liner
[13:20:09] <paule32> for each call

[13:42:14] <Zauberfisch> paule32: you can read multiple lines too
[13:43:43] <Zauberfisch> but if you mean you want to run program-a 3 times and get the output of all 3 runs into program-b, then you have to somehow concatinate the output of all 3 runs of program-a and pass that to program-b
[13:45:06] <Zauberfisch> say a loop in bash, or exec on a find statement, or xargs, ...
[13:48:13] <Zauberfisch> and as for input, there is a couple of ways to read stdin. I am not sure which one is best practrice, but you can look a fopen/fgets, or you can get the whole stdin with stream_get_contents(STDIN) or file_get_contents("php://stdin")
[13:51:58] <Zauberfisch> ok, so I have a question about traits:
[13:52:34] <Zauberfisch> What are thoughts on using traits as an interface light kind of thing by defining abstract methods, but never defining an interface?
[13:53:13] <Zauberfisch> I've only used traits in the most baisc of ways so far, and have cases where I used traits to implement interfaces (fully or partially)
[13:56:14] <Zauberfisch> and I just thought it might be enough to declare a method abstract in a trait instead of writing an interface
