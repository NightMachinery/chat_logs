[00:03:04] <Z-module> [-_-]: a ring is defined to be a set R equipped with two binary operations, called addition and multiplication generically but that doesn't mean anything by itself. Addition is very nearly always denoted '+' and multiplication is denoted by juxtaposing symbols (or by '*' or various other possibilities).  In your ring of n x n matrices (over some given field), the addition operation is ordinary matrix addition, where A + B means just use
[00:03:04] <Z-module> the field addition within each pair of corresponding entries. YOu can see that A + B = B + A  always holds, because  x + y = y + x   for all x, y in the field.
[00:04:06] <Z-module> (and for the general ring, those two binary operations have to satisfy a list of axioms you should know, [-_-] )
[00:04:46] <Z-module> one of those axioms is actually  r + s = s + r   for all r, s in R.  So "addition is commutative by axiom".

[00:05:13] <Z-module> so talking about "x commuting with y", if that can somtimes fail, is always about the other operation in R, the ring multiplication
[00:06:30] <Inline> right
[00:06:53] <Z-module> similarly, a "commutative ring" just means a ring in which  xy = yx   for all x, y

[00:07:13] <Z-module> subtraction isn't a separate thing, really
[00:07:21] <Inline> hmm
[00:07:32] <Z-module>  a - b  just means   a + b'   where b' is the unique additive inverse of b in the ring
[00:08:01] <Z-module> you actually write this b' as   -b

[00:34:39] <majestic> If you then take the average of all these matrices, you would get an average transition matrix which gives you the transitions youd expect to see an average year. If you then multiply this matrix with itself those are the transition probabilities youd expect to see over a 2-year horizon. But when I am comparing the multiplication with itself, to the 2-year observed average transition matrix, they are far from close to each other.

[02:33:09] <cherim> It forms that angle with e1

[02:45:50] <Z-module> But in this thing here, {e1, e2} is actually the standard ordered basis for R^2
[02:45:51] <mra90> then*

[03:00:07] <cherim> And there are two possible answers

[04:40:09] <dude12312414> typically the order goes differential -> integral -> multivariable
[04:40:58] <dude12312414> i guess you could learn definite integrals before derivatives, but you wouldn't be able to go far without the fundamental theorem of calculus, which uses derivatives

[04:43:46] <dude12312414> you could do multivariable differential calculus i guess without ever learning what an integral is

[05:42:03] <Capricious> dude12312414: is it more helpful to start with linear algebra before differential calculus or the two are really quite unrelated so it wouldn’t matter?
[05:45:38] <laurus> Capricious: This is maybe an unpopular opinion, but I think you should study linear algebra _before_ you do anything with multivariable calculus
[05:46:12] <Fangs> question was about differential calculus
[05:46:36] <dude12312414> yeah i'd say learning linear algebra before, especially before multivariable calc, would be useful
[05:46:45] <laurus> Fangs: I know I'm just sharing my opinion and taking the opportunity to explain something
[05:46:46] <laurus> Capricious: The reason is that when you read about certain things in multivariable calculus, particularly in the integration area, you will see stuff from linear algebra and if you haven't studied that first you won't know what it means
[05:47:43] <Capricious> Thanks, I really appreciate it! I also need to learn statistics and probability but I presume I do this after algebra and calculus?
[05:48:26] <laurus> Capricious: by algebra I assume you mean linear algebra. Yes, it's hard to understand those applied areas without these foundations
[05:48:43] <Fangs> I don't think its an unpopular oppinion either. It's impossible to understand MULTIVARIABLE calculus without first learning linear algebra
[05:49:02] <Fangs> Capricious: when you deal with continuous probabilities and statistics, you need to be able to do integration at least
[05:49:08] *** Joins: zacts (~zacts@user/zacts)
[05:49:41] <Fangs> if you're only dealing with discrete probabilities, you'll be doing sums instead of integration.
[05:50:35] <Capricious> Great, super helpful. Thank you.
[05:50:37] <dude12312414> for differential calculus (single variable) you could easily get away without linear algebra to be fair
[05:50:38] <dude12312414> but multivariable calculus and linear algebra are definitely intimately related
[05:50:40] <dude12312414> since this is the framework in which you properly generalize the notion of tangent lines
[05:50:42] <dude12312414> (and also to understand vector or matrix-valued functions)
[05:51:09] <Capricious> I’m using Khan academy as a starting point.
[05:52:02] <buster> it's not like you have to completely learn one without stopping and then start another one
[05:53:23] <Fangs> Capricious: are you audiocat from the other day?
[05:53:39] <Fangs> they said they also wanted to learn these topics to understand ML

[12:33:41] <qergle> which is what you're doing
[12:34:40] <qergle> every term of the 15 in your expansion is picking 4 out of {x1,2x2,x3} (with replacement)
[12:35:13] *** Joins: hendursa1 (~weechat@user/hendursaga)
[12:35:59] <qergle> so if you pick x1,x1,2x2,x3 that term is x1^2*2x2*x^3*(4!/2!)
[12:36:11] <qergle> or 24*x1^2*x2*x3
[12:36:44] <qergle> oops x^3 meant to be x3
[12:36:57] <qergle> so if you pick x1,x1,2x2,x3 that term is x1^2*2x2*x3*(4!/2!) [correction]
[12:37:27] <qergle> anyways, that's why you have C(6,4)=15 of them

[12:56:17] <qergle> if the last digit is 1 or 3, the next to last can be 0 or 2 or 2 or 4
[12:56:31] <qergle> can you start to smell a recursion?

[16:55:28] <[itchyjunk]> yes
[16:55:30] <PlanckWalk> Well, where else would it be centered?
[16:55:35] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[16:55:36] <PlanckWalk> Also you can just plug in directly
[16:55:41] <greenbagels> |z| = sqrt((a+bi)(a-bi)) = sqrt(a^2+b^2)
[16:55:47] <fweht> center is the point where all  points have equal distance to

[16:59:51] <[itchyjunk]> oh that it is..
[17:00:10] * [itchyjunk] desperately tries to remember why that represented a circle
[17:00:39] <PlanckWalk> In general in C, Euclidean distance between  w  and  z  is  |w-z|
[17:00:59] <greenbagels> a circle is the locus of points of fixed distance to a given point
[17:02:33] <greenbagels> x^2+y^2 = k^2 => sqrt(x^2+y^2)=k; but sqrt(x^2+y^2) is sqrt((x-0)^2+(y-0)^2), which is d((x,y), (0,0)) where d is the euclidean metric
[17:02:35] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: it might be clearer if people here were writing the actual set involved, not just the defining equation alone:  For fixed point z_0, and fixed positive real k, the set of points in C, { z : |z - z_0| = k },  is all the points whose distnace from z_0 is k.
[17:03:25] <greenbagels> that is a good point, being fast and loose with language probably doesn't help...
[17:03:52] <[itchyjunk]> Z-module, ohh
[17:04:13] <[itchyjunk]> then z_0 is the center in that case
[17:04:35] <[itchyjunk]> yeah i have forgotten what little i knew so everything is confusing
[17:04:57] <[itchyjunk]> i am trying to remember what euclidean distance was.. was it the metric defined on a metric space?
[17:05:21] <greenbagels> its the notion of distance you use in everyday life; straight line distance
[17:05:51] <[itchyjunk]> oh okay
[17:05:52] <greenbagels> sqrt((x1-x2)^2+(y1-y2)^2+...)
[17:06:11] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: in R^n, it's the *specific* metric  d( (x_1,...,x_n), (y_1,...,y_n) ) = sqrt( (x_1 - y_1)^2 +...+ (x_n - y_n)^2 )
[17:06:39] <[itchyjunk]> oh oops, not `the` metric, `a` metric
[17:07:40] <Z-module> this metric is the exact same thing as d(z,w) = |z - w|  for z, w both being points in C, where z = (x_1,x_2),  w = (y_1,y_2)

[22:29:01] <TheWild> folks, is there a version of RSA that uses Galois field instead of modulo arithmetic? Would that be even possible?
[22:29:37] *** Quits: APic (apic@apic.name) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[22:31:43] <riv> I don't think that would be possible
[22:32:12] <savask> Yeah, the modulus in RSA is a product of two different primes, while Galois fields are of prime power order
[22:32:27] <savask> So at least it will require some substantial rethinking

[22:58:29] <TheWild> while modular arithmetic has primes, Galois fields have irreducible polynomials (that I incorrectly called Galois primes long time ago).
[22:58:53] <TheWild> by the way, does that polynomial defining a finite field have a particular name?
[23:00:25] *** Quits: Julian (~tos9@python/site-packages/Julian) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[23:00:44] <Z-module> For a given prime p and natural n > 1, there are usually more than one irreducible poly q(x) in F_p[x] of degree n, that you can use to form  F_p[x]/<q(x)>  = a finite field of order p^n
[23:03:19] <Z-module> maybe you're thinking of the fact that the field of order p^n is the splitting field of  x^(p^n) - x  over F_p ?

[23:16:35] <manemm> can someone give me a help?
[23:16:43] <emba> maybe
[23:17:03] <emba> try asking the question. Usually if people understand something they like to help.
[23:17:30] <manemm> the number of ways you can "permutate" AAABCCDDDD, with no adjacent letters
[23:17:45] <Z-module> the word is "permute", but whatever
[23:18:16] <emba> does 'no adjacent letters' mean that the allowed arrangments don't have any two letters that are the same next to each other?
[23:18:35] <manemm> sorry for the english, i've tried using the exclusion principle, but for some reason im getting a negative number when subtracting
[23:18:46] <manemm> yes
[23:18:50] <manemm> that is right emba
[23:19:07] *** Quits: drogas (~drogas@jump2.jet.uk) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:19:16] <manemm> is it permutate? i thought it was a bad translation
[23:19:59] *** Quits: Julian (~tos9@python/site-packages/Julian) (Quit: leaving)
[23:20:50] <emba> You want to know the number of ways you can permute the letters in AAABCCDDDD so that none of the arrangements have the same letter next to itself.
[23:21:04] <manemm> yes
[23:21:39] <manemm> i tried excluding when , "aa", "cc", "dd"
[23:23:21] <emba> I like the idea there but you would have to be carefull not to exclude to much since some of the ways in which an arramenget contains an AA will also include a CC and then you would have subtracted those twice.
[23:25:21] <manemm> hmmm
[23:26:06] <manemm> i see, any idea how to solve this?
[23:26:18] <CuriousErnestBro> p,q,r,s in [0,1], r=s=1 iff q > p. and p=1 iff 2r > s, and q=1 iff 2s > r.
[23:26:38] <CuriousErnestBro> How do I find the parametrizations of the equalities here?
[23:29:49] <manemm> Just exclude all the AA or all the CC? They give different results
