[22:27:01] <SpaceVimBot> <tnt> Hi all, brandnew to SpaceVim and wondering how to get rid of auto-pairs?
[22:49:53] <SpaceVimBot> <tnt> Hm, I 'disabled_plugins = ["auto-pairs"]' in [options] but this doesn't what I expected.

[22:49:55] <SpaceVimBot> <tnt> I just don't want that closing braces, parens and quotes are automatically inserted when I type an opening one.
