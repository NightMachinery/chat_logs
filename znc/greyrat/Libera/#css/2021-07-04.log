[06:14:47] <Rockwood> good morning
[06:15:21] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, hi
[06:19:55] <Rockwood> how to change marker position? https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/yLVMbEz

[07:39:50] <entuland> Rockwood, you don't have direct control over that position, but you can alter stuff like list-style-position and tweak the overall placement altering the padding and margins of the ULs, OLs and LIs
[07:40:50] <Rockwood> entuland, https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-forked-9ot1z?file=/menuStyle.css i wanna do proper arrow
[07:41:22] <Rockwood> as per menu facing arrow should be show
[07:41:37] <Rockwood> i am very confuse how to do this
[07:41:50] <entuland> not sure how that relates to the ::marker
[07:42:16] <entuland> for those arrows you can use a simple ::before with some font-awesome icon
[07:42:25] <entuland> or some SVG
[07:47:36] <Rockwood> ::before does wht?
[07:48:02] <entuland> it gives you a "free" new block that doesn't require any additional markup
[07:48:11] <entuland> which you can use to add such a decoration
[07:49:32] <Rockwood> ok chking that
[07:50:07] <Rockwood> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before i am right?
[07:50:34] <entuland> yes, that one
[07:50:55] <entuland> a minimal example, but there you have one pretty much the same: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/gdozh9v5/
[07:51:51] <entuland> the advantage of using a ::before is that you have full control over the box (dimensions, position and whatnot)
[07:52:12] <entuland> ::before or ::after, depending on the case
[07:54:11] <Rockwood> for up and down then?
[07:54:41] <entuland> the same you would use with any relatively positioned element - you can use margins and left, top, right, bottom
[07:55:08] <Rockwood> ok
[07:55:16] <Rockwood> now try time
[07:55:43] <entuland> "before" and "after" are just about whether they will be "injected" before the content of the element or after it, you are free to move it in any position regardless of that
