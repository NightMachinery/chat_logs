[00:42:19] <GuiToris> hello, is it 'care for somebody' or 'care about somebody'?
[00:43:04] <LjL> both are valid but they don't mean the same
[00:43:16] <LjL> https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/care_for#English
[00:44:33] <GuiToris> 'It ain't right with love to share When you find he doesn't care for you'
[00:44:37] <GuiToris> should this be 'about' instead?
[00:44:50] <inhahe_> care for means love romantically afaik
[00:45:02] <LjL> "I don't care about him" means it doesn't matter to you what he says, for example, or just that he doesn't matter to you in general. "I don't care for him" means you don't *like* him.
[00:45:14] <LjL> GuiToris, no
[00:45:33] <LjL> "he doesn't care for you" means he has no interest in you or even doesn't like you
[00:45:39] <GuiToris> oh, got it, thanks a lot! :)
[00:46:05] <inhahe_> ljl i think maybe in this case it means he doesn't love the person romantically? 
[00:46:17] <inhahe_> not sure though
[00:46:25] <LjL> that's kind of what i meant by having no interest in you
[00:46:31] <inhahe_> oh ok
[00:47:16] <LjL> but also in general, i'd say "not caring for" has more of a negative connotation than "not caring about" (which can also be a bit negative, but is mostly neutral)
[00:47:35] <LjL> i'm talking specifically about the negatives here, because in the positive, "caring for" can also mean taking care of someone, which gets confusing

[09:02:28] <amigojapan> I am kind of confused too, cause in Japanese we say things like "I am weak at chess" for "I am bad at chess" or "I am weak at the sun" I cant remember how to say "I am weak at the sun" properly in english
[09:03:04] <amigojapan> or 'I am weak at heat"

[09:09:45] <amigojapan> vonunov: more like sutff like "my skin is sensitive to the sun, I get early sun burnt"
[09:10:36] <inhahe_> you'd say i'm sensitive to sunlight then (rather than heat)
[09:11:29] <amigojapan> I mean in Japanese you can say both "I am weak at the sun" and also "I am weak at heat" they dont mean the same thing
[09:12:18] <amigojapan> I am wek at heat, can mean that you dont like hot weather

[15:58:25] <LTCD> blue" which is an overly long way to talk. In my experience, people do this in the office all the time, but I never really understood it.

[16:26:13] <mornfall> *shrug* ‘the sky is purple’ ‘actually blue’ works fine
[16:27:20] <LTCD> mornfall I completely understand my example above is simple, but people in the office tend to use this trick when discussing difficult things you probably do not know the answer to, or you use it to correct someone in a quick way.

[16:28:25] <mornfall> it also works in more complicated situations, don't worry; but if this is supposed to be a quiz rather than an actual question, then never mind
[16:28:35] <Jong> dTal  it sounds a bit weird to say "desire to have" ?
[16:28:44] <dTal> just a bit
[16:28:54] <dTal> as you say it is redundant
[16:29:03] <Jong> okay you gave me your opinion. Awesome thanks
[16:29:18] <dTal> you'd perhaps use it if you wanted to emphasize "have" for some reason

[16:31:48] <LTCD> Nah, there is an Oxford Dictionary word for what I am trying to say. My example above might not have been one in which the word can be used, but the gist of what I am asking should come across.

[16:32:49] <LTCD> When a Police Station Representative (lawyer) tells you what to say during a police interrogation, the words often are English but make absolutely no sentence. This is because the you are using the XXX word without realising to "stick" your words to the police officer's questions.
[16:33:05] <LTCD> the words are English but make no sense*
[16:34:40] <LTCD> A stupid example is your lawyer tells you to say: blue chocolate, which makes no sense until you are in the room getting interrogated and the police officer asks you: What colour is the sky? What is your favourite chocolate? *Very* oversimplified example.

[22:32:03] <Jong> huf  true
[22:32:23] <Jong> huf  but I'm trying to impress my boss by sounding pro 
[22:32:55] <huf> saying mmap is more pro than explaining it :)
[22:33:07] <huf> people can do a man mmap if they dont already know
[22:33:28] <huf> (and learn c if they dont know that, but people like that dont really exist anyway)
[22:33:39] <huf> also, options like --mmap_mode are pretty ugly
[22:33:45] <huf> please make it --mmap-mode
[22:33:46] <huf> :)

[22:34:48] <Jong> huf  what about this: Use --mmap_mode to bypass slow dataloading or to preserve physical memory space.
[22:34:57] <huf> eh

[22:35:07] <huf> these are all less clear and precise than just saying mmap
[22:35:09] <huf> :)
[22:35:37] <huf> but you could say "file is memory mapped instead of being loaded" or something like that

[22:52:49] <Jong> "--mmap_mode mmaps the dataset. That is, the dataset is kept on disk but is accessed as if it were in memory. Use --mmap_mode when preloading the dataset takes too long or when there isn't enough memory to hold the dataset."
[22:52:52] <Jong> Now that is perfect

[22:53:08] <Jong> you have to admit, that is elegantly written
