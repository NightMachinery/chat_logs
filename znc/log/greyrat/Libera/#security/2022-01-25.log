The correct solution would be to design buildings properly instead of relying on the power grid! I don’t speak for everyone
[01:15:07] <Joanna> but I’d rather go without climate control than be spied upon.
[01:16:11] <ajak> ... is it possible to build a building which can passively keep itself cool/hot?
[01:16:25] <Joanna> It should not even be possible for irresponsible people to affect the utility service of other customers.
[01:17:08] <grandpa_grim> psyop, most of the carbon emission are corporate/military not individuals.

[01:21:15] <Joanna> grandpa_grim: the carbon thing is a big scam if these people cared about the environment they would remove lanes from roads and plant trees.
[01:21:28] <mats1> the practical solution is heat pump retrofits at scale, which results in vast efficiencies but also more fragility

[02:21:17] <Joanna> mats1: I agree that the solutions of the climate change people are not in our best interests.they are the same people who created problems to begin with.  This doesn’t mean that a good solution that gets rid of dependency on cars isn’t possible. I’m against stuffing everyone into smart cities . Also it’s possible to have rural train stations it was fine before cars. Did you know that the first suburbs had a mainstreet with

[08:06:41] <NiLon> panella32 depends what "secure" means
[08:07:08] <NiLon> for hiding the content it is quite poor
[08:07:52] <panella32> The contents are videos.
[08:08:18] <panella32> Can someone see the inside without having the password?
[08:08:26] <NiLon> yes
[08:08:48] <panella32> So what the password was supposed to do?
[08:09:00] <NiLon> you can't directly watch the videos
[08:09:08] <NiLon> or whatever the content is
[08:09:36] <panella32> Interesting.. then what someone needs to be able to watch the content?
[08:09:58] <NiLon> password or exploit to the algorithm

[08:11:46] <panella32> So the bottom line is this: Someone can relatively easily see what type of content it is (whether it's document or media) but can't see it as it is without having password.

[08:15:02] <Affliction> panella32: https://www.win-rar.com/encryption-faq.html?&L=0#what-is-the-encrypt-file-names-option
[08:15:03] <websec> ^ WinRAR Encryption Technology FAQ
[08:16:19] <panella32> Affliction Acutally I was afraid that they might not say all aspect of their encryption process specially its disadvantages and flaws. That's why came to hear more from #security guys.
[08:16:42] <Affliction> Yeah, I specifically linked to the part that describes that option
[08:17:17] <Affliction> I've not touched winrar in well over a decade, but 7zip has a similar option.
[08:17:31] <panella32> Thanks I'll check it out.
[08:18:02] <Affliction> But yeah, that option should resolve NiLon's concerns
[08:18:19] <NiLon> it matters a lot what kind of security you are looking for and what is the right approach
[08:18:24] <NiLon> there is no single good thing for everything
[08:18:25] *** Joins: bytehackr (~Sandipan@43.252.250.126)
[08:18:30] <ajak> it's aes256 which isn't terrible
[08:18:31] <Affliction> You might be able to speculate that it's video content by the size of the archive, but the archive itself should be rather opaque at that point
[08:20:30] *** Quits: bytehackr (~Sandipan@43.252.250.126) (Client Quit)
[08:20:56] <NiLon> also as you have no access to source code, you can't never be certain what kind of backdoor it contains
[08:21:24] <Affliction> Indeed, or if they're using ECB mode
[08:21:27] <panella32> I always wonder what if I archive files without any compressions https://i.imgur.com/oQfRmzM.png? Can it make it easier for someone to see the content if I don't use compression options (just "store")?
[08:21:39] *** Quits: Yuzu02 (~Yuzu02@152.166.145.68) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[08:22:08] <Affliction> The data would be compressed, then encrypted.
[08:22:26] <Affliction> But, if you're storing video, general purpose compression won't do much for it anyway
[08:22:31] *** Joins: redstarcomrade (uid99592@user/redstarcomrade)
[08:22:33] <ajak> NiLon: you can actually just read the assembly, or completely decompile and reverse engineer
[08:22:47] <panella32> I use "store" not "normal", is it still a compression Affliction?
[08:23:03] <Affliction> "Store" almost always means "skip the compression step"
[08:23:13] <Affliction> I doubt it'd do anything for security
[08:23:21] <Affliction> Just make the file larger, and maybe speed up unpacking
[08:23:39] <Affliction> Your main concern should be using a strong password
[08:23:58] *** Quits: Roey (~Roey@user/Roey) (Quit: Client exiting)
[08:24:01] <NiLon> we actually use rar only for video compression
[08:24:07] <NiLon> it's quite good
[08:25:11] <panella32> Actually the only reason I go with "store" is just because of its speed. The amount of videos and the length of each is huge and I don't have much time to wait for compression process.
[08:25:51] <mats1> you can use 7zip and just tar the file, panella32
[08:25:57] <labrador> I duno I don't trust the encryption of proprietary formats like rar

[08:33:01] <mats1> i would be surprised if you can't encrypt without compression using winzip
[08:33:39] <panella32> Honestly I know almost nothing about encryptions and my only intention is encrypting my files before transferring to another cloud and decrypting them when they back to my own cloud. If that gpg things or any other alternative can do it quickly and securely please let me know.
[08:34:07] <Affliction> gpg's whole purpose is encryption
[08:34:11] <mats1> you've got three recommendations already
[08:34:45] <panella32> yes just wanted to find out which one has more votes here.
[08:34:49] <Affliction> 7z is open source and pretty much works like winrar
[08:34:54] <Affliction> if that's more familiar
[08:35:05] <Affliction> I'd expect if its AES impl were trash, it would have been called out by now
[08:35:12] <labrador> hmm gpg is perfect for that
[08:35:20] <labrador> Its job is crypto after all
[08:36:10] <panella32> Affliction I'm going to check it out.
[08:36:12] <panella32> labrador hopefully it's not too complicated for an ordinary user!
[08:36:17] <NiLon> if your threat doesn't include 3 letter agencies, then that winrar likely is just good enough as the weak point likely is going to be either end of transmission rather than the transmission itself
[08:36:36] <labrador> uhh...depends on how good you are at learning panella32
[08:36:58] <labrador> I dont think there's a gui frontend for gpg4win
[08:38:50] <panella32> NiLon fortunately I'm not worried about those agencies :)
[08:39:01] <ajak> ordinary users don't care about encryption anyway so anything more than nothing should be pretty good
[08:39:04] <panella32> And I wish there was an app without any poor aspect for encrypting strongly and quickly! So probably my best bet would be Winrar/7zip
[08:39:09] <NiLon> labrador kleopatra I guess is
[08:39:34] <labrador> NiLon, thats good ig
[08:39:43] <labrador> Now panella32 can use gpg with a gui
[08:39:52] <panella32> good news :)
[08:41:03] <panella32> The end destination will be my mac. gpg can be run on macOS right?
[08:41:26] <labrador> well its certainly better supported than on windows,so better yes
[08:42:09] <labrador> Also ajak,I wrote my usb drive twice with random data totally

[08:42:46] <panella32> Great! Thanks everybody. I really appreciate it.

[08:51:40] <Affliction> Indeed. Compressed and encrypted file transfer that'll work on pretty much any *nix boxes: tar -czf - * | ssh u@h "cd foo; tar -xzf -"
[08:52:03] <Affliction> substitute -z for -j or -J for stronger compression, adjust order of commands as needed
[08:52:13] <mats1> this guy uses winrar, lets be helpful
[08:52:22] <panella32> Thanks for that detailed command Affliction!
[08:52:25] <Affliction> yeah, that's why I suggested 7z
[08:53:07] <NiLon> not 100% positive but wasn't windows suppose to have native ssh nowdays
[08:53:07] <panella32> mats1 I've already used ssh to login into azure vms :)
[08:53:16] <NiLon> or was it still in some beta feature you need to install manually
[08:54:06] <NiLon> always a mystery how people manage with windows when it lacks all the primitive tools

[08:58:23] <labrador> My logic was that if I spit enough random data at blocks the wear levelling would make no difference
[08:58:30] <Affliction> Yeah, I know there's WSL these days, it's just not the same
[08:58:36] <labrador> All blocks would get written with random data
[08:58:46] <labrador> The only problem then would be read only blocks
[08:58:48] <NiLon> flash is a storage tech, ata is a interface, so it can be ata or not
[08:59:04] <ajak> but we're talking about a flash drive
[08:59:07] <NiLon> labrador problem is that there can be data in non-writable areas
[08:59:17] <Affliction> There were flash memory cards that pretty much used an ATA interface

[09:00:08] <NiLon> that ata erase should also wipe that, even if it is not writable anymore
[09:00:11] <Affliction> But yeah, pretty much all flash drives overprovision and have wear levelling, I'd expect filling with /dev/zero just adjusts pointers to a common zero block
[09:00:26] <labrador> Yes but thats why I did /dev/random
[09:00:29] <Affliction> /dev/urandom won't necessarily touchall blocks due to overprovisioning
[09:01:01] <Affliction> secure erase -- there are disks that encrypt transparently, and secure erase just erases the key
[09:01:05] <labrador> oh yeah overprovisioning is something that exists too
[09:01:23] <NiLon> for pen drives I would suggest just setting encrypted partition and when you need to wipe it, lose they keys

[09:03:51] <Affliction> If you're handing it off, I generally just do 2 passes of /dev/random and a pass with /dev/zero
