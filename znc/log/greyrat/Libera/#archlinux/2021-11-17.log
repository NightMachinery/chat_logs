[01:46:46] <MacGyver> Sometimes that's more than just a quick press -- though not the full 5 seconds for a hard poweroff.
[01:47:02] <Aryan> MacGyver, that long press is force shut down i guess

[01:47:40] <keir> what a stubborn little power button
[01:47:48] <MacGyver> So make sure logind is configured correctly and then check whether the power button is even doing anything with how you're pressing it.
[01:47:59] <jcbjoe2021> Aryan: even in a windows side if you press power really quick it puts the computer to sleep.

[01:58:46] <MacGyver> It's somewhere under "Power" for me, if I recall correctly.
[01:58:56] <MacGyver> Something like "suspend mode", where you can pick "Windows" or "Linux".

[05:33:51] <randomxusr> got it. I thought the *Rat* referred to the Madcatz R.A.T gaming mouse only

[08:10:37] <Disconsented> Gave it a reboot for good measure, one thing I noticed is that the keyboard preview for those languages is all with latin characters
[08:10:37] <bparker> is that the only place you added them? did you check in a terminal or something that they're actually set?
[08:11:04] <bparker> cause I had a heck of a time finding a file that X would actually source upon login
[08:11:18] <bparker> there's too many potentials

[08:12:42] <Disconsented> I can see the service in systemd status as well
[08:13:19] <bparker> what about
[08:13:21] <bparker> export XMODIFIERS=@im=fcitx
[08:13:37] <bparker> I have that one too
[08:14:25] <bparker> I think I ended up using ~/.xconfig for the vars since I have other English-only users logging in on the same box
[08:14:31] <bparker> sorry, ~/.xprofile

[08:14:49] <phrik> Title: pastefile1 · paste.gg (at paste.gg)
[08:15:03] <Disconsented> Ill try xconfig, cheers
[08:15:21] <bparker> I mean if it's already set there's no need to change it
[08:15:32] <bparker> and you're still not able to type even in that same terminal window?
[08:15:39] <bparker> and fcitx is indeed running?
[08:16:12] <Disconsented> It responds to the shortcut to change language, I can set the language and fcitx5-config displays chinese 
[08:16:28] <Disconsented> So I assume its running
[08:16:34] <Disconsented> Shows up in systemd status as well
[08:16:52] <bparker> hmm
[08:16:57] <bparker> I have never tried version 5
[08:17:15] <Disconsented> Might as well try 4 then
[08:17:19] <bparker> I use the normal fcitx package plus fcitx-mozc for Japanese, and it works for me
[08:17:36] <bparker> in most apps at least

[14:05:48] <WickedDekciw> I've got a problem driving me crazy. I'm trying to get into the internal partition table of Android full system image (mmcblk0.img) in order to process a particular partition with photorec for recovery. I've tried what amounts to everything under the sun to no avail. Any ideas?
[14:05:59] <earnestly> That really was a bit of a problem before so it's nice to have this usable
[14:05:59] <plainoldcheese> rcf: thanks i think that's what happened because when i delete the ones in .local/share/applications those applications are no longer available in the desktop

[14:06:17] <Khorne> WickedDekciw, can you mount the image?
[14:07:01] <WickedDekciw> khorne with kpartx I can mount the full image as a total, but I can't see anything inside it.
[14:07:17] <WickedDekciw> I want to access only a particular partition inside of there.
[14:07:26] <grawity> that's literally what kpartx is supposed to do
[14:07:33] <grawity> are you mixing it up with loop mounts?
[14:07:38] <Khorne> ^
[14:08:10] <WickedDekciw> grawity, I tried kpartx really when not much else worked, it didn't seem to identify any particular filesystem
[14:08:19] <grawity> it identifies partitions, not filesystems
[14:08:29] <grawity> a) the older method is, you attach the image to a loop device with `losetup`, then scan partitions with `kpartx`, and get /dev/mapper devices for them
[14:08:48] <grawity> b) the newer method is, you attach the image to a loop device with `losetup -P`, then immediately get partitions as /dev/loop0p1 etc.

[16:55:31] <earnestly> Somewhat related, have you seen pictures of tamper resistent dies?
[16:55:35] <Foxboron> We already crossed out "DRM", "Microsoft" and "Disney"
[16:55:38] <MacGyver> brejela: Exactly *what* is the alternative that makes you call the TPM redundant.
[16:55:49] <MacGyver> brejela: Redundancy implies there's a different solution.
[16:55:49] <Foxboron> brejela: I'm waiting
[16:55:53] <rcf> brejela: it is redundant to you, as someone who doesn't want to use it. But even if your goal is to protect the right of the owner™ to do as they please, you're ignoring something like the enterprise or institutional use case, where the owner/user distinction is quite clear and legitimate under all but literally insane viewpoints. 
[16:56:08] <MacGyver> brejela: You're allowed to backpedal on using that term, but I want to know what you meant if you stick by it.
[16:56:44] <earnestly> Personally I quite like swimming in the security that basic commodity hardware can provide; it's much harder to target the generic than security devices that are specifically designed to perform some action - it makes them a target for tampering
[16:56:52] <earnestly> Such as how yubikey is closed source
[16:57:03] <brejela> It is redundant as in "not needed" - As in "this type of cryptographic storage is not needed. - Except on rcf's case.
[16:57:10] <brejela> I agree with rcf 
[16:57:33] <Foxboron> brejela: "redundant" is "not needed because there is an alternative".

[17:03:45] <Foxboron> brejela: you are wrong
[17:03:50] <brejela> I couldn't, however, care less wether or not people use it. It while it might have "legitimate" uses, corporate decisions villified the technology itself.
[17:04:10] <Foxboron> It's not used for these purposes. You are forwarding ideas proposed 12 years ago that never came to be
[17:04:13] *** Joins: wingstroke (~wingstrok@193.176.211.49)
[17:04:36] <MacGyver> Honestly, so far corporate interest has proven perfectly capable to take system freedom away where they want to without needing to resort to the TPM.
[17:04:44] *** Joins: pokr (~pokr@124.78.243.219)
[17:05:03] <Foxboron> TPMs today do a *lot* in improving the security in modern devices. You have an inexpensive fairly good HSM in all modern machines.
[17:05:06] <Foxboron> *think* about that
[17:05:47] <earnestly> It's much easier to compromise TPMs from an adversarial perspective because you know secrets will be stored there; it's harder to do that with generic hardware in a targetted fashion
[17:05:54] <brejela> Foxboron: It is used for these purposes. Discounting the benefits.
[17:06:06] <Foxboron> brejela: Which purposes are you talking about now :)?
[17:06:19] <brejela> Foxboron: Same ones I was talking about earlier.
[17:06:30] <rcf> brejela: may you cite specific cases, seeing as how it hasn't been a requirement on the most popular consumer operating system until... the future, technically, as long as Windows 10 is supported? 
[17:06:43] <Foxboron> brejela: No, you are making vague claims about the purpose when I have said they are not used for such purposes. Do you have any specific cases?
[17:06:45] <brejela> MacGyver: And yet corporate still finds a way to distorn new technologies into giving themselves more control.
[17:07:42] <Foxboron> People still misunderstand the reason why Windows 11 requires a TPM, even

[19:17:32] <jprjr> did you manually edit /etc/passwd?
[19:17:37] <monsieur-grumme> yep.
[19:17:45] <jprjr> well there's the fuck-up, is my guess
[19:18:02] <monsieur-grumme> Well that was fast.

[22:10:06] <berber> Khorne:  I just realized my problem is a different one.  I want to set the variable SSH_AUTH_SOCK to $(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket).  This command output expansion doesn't work by setting environments in systemd's files.  furthermore, i need to run this after i started my gpg service.  so i just write an ExecStartPost hook.  but now i need
[22:10:06] <berber> to ensure that the gpg service is run before anything else.  i could always manually have a Requires and After setting for each unit...  do you have a recommendation?
