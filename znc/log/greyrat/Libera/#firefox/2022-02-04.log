[17:39:22] <hingoanashi1209> Does anyone know in what file or config setting the choice of search engine appears?
[17:40:32] <hingoanashi1209> oh, I see.  maybe set it to a search engine I don't like and and do it so nameserver settings redirect that server's url to something innocuous
[17:40:47] <hingoanashi1209> like 127.0.0.1
[17:41:03] <hingoanashi1209> e.g. in the hosts file if it checks that first

[17:52:07] <Cork> hingoanashi1209: about your original question, about:config => keyword.enabled and set that to disabled
[17:52:38] <Cork> that will take care of the searching in the url bar for most of the times (it buggs some times, but i think they've fixed most of those now days)
[17:54:08] <hingoanashi1209> Thank you!!!!!!!!!
[17:55:04] <hingoanashi1209> it does something else now  (i.e. it adds www.[what you typed].com if it is illformed) but at least it navigates instead of searching.   Thank you so much!
[17:57:32] <hingoanashi1209> Thank you @Cork I can now use firefox again!!
[17:58:03] <Cork> hingoanashi1209: you can disable that with browser.urlbar.fixup*
[17:58:20] <Cork> browser.fixup.alternate.enabled
[17:58:20] <hingoanashi1209> oh, nice, thank you again
[17:58:32] <Cork> these are the first things i disable in a new profile :)
[18:01:20] <hingoanashi1209> I don't see anything with browser.urlbar.fixup

[20:14:04] <akik> why are ui elements getting bigger for no reason?
[20:14:20] <akik> this time the tab bar got increased 
[20:14:43] <akik> then i have to figure out userChrome.css to make them sane again
[20:18:43] <dalias> because all the ui developers are windows users who've moved to 4k monitors and windows has no working support for logical dpi != 96, so everything is tiny
[20:18:55] <dalias> and then they just make it big so it "looks good" on their screen
