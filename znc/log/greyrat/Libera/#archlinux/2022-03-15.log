[00:06:30] <zr> https://github.com/archlinux/mkinitcpio/tree/master/hooks see the filesystem hook . It adds every file system module to the initramfs. Witch makes it bigger.And i currently use uncompressed image so it doesnt have to get decompressed it.Making boot time smaller.

[02:27:06] * topcat001 needs an espresso

[02:32:46] <Scimmia> Edu4rdSHL, topcat001, and just what does it compress?
[02:33:05] <bud>  | wc -l 452
[02:33:14] <topcat001> However, there is that bit about the data object size threshold
[02:33:33] <topcat001> so in effect probably nothing gets compressed
[02:33:48] <topcat001> which explains the strings output

[02:39:08] <topcat001> It seems if I compare `journalctl` with `strings`, most of the entries are there in the binary file already.
[02:39:33] <topcat001> So it looks like most entries fall below the compression threshold.
[02:39:38] <bud> i don't know what to do now. i really liked this systemd x-session setup. and one of the main advantages was the ease of viewing logs. before this i just started i3 from within a terminal to be able to see its logs in realtime.

[02:41:50] <topcat001> ok I hereby conclude that at least on my machine it is not compressing much :)
[02:41:59] <BrainDamage> the binary header takes about 288 bytes, so if the line is less long than 512-288 bytes, it won't get compressed
[02:42:21] <BrainDamage> which means it's hardly ever used
[02:42:54] <BrainDamage> maybe if you try to fill it with high codepoints it might hit that frequently
[02:43:01] <topcat001> so, assuming no compression for simplicity, it is not entirely shocking that given it keeps the text in its buffers, journalctl takes some memory.
[02:43:02] *** Joins: Cirrus_Minor (~Cirrus_Mi@user/cirrus-minor/x-4863185)
[02:43:04] <Edu4rdSHL> But that doesn't mean that they aren't compressed, that just means that conditions aren't met most times
[02:43:41] <topcat001> so there might not be an actaul leak after all... guessing
[02:44:01] <topcat001> I have now agreed with all parties involved :D
[02:44:45] <bud> maybe, but it is bad design if it cost 220mb RSS to get the equivalent of tail -f FILE. 
[02:45:11] <Edu4rdSHL> That's a few MB, it's 2022.
[02:45:38] <Edu4rdSHL> So, "i don't know what to do now": continue using journalctl
[02:46:16] <topcat001> I think it does not optimise specially for the -f case.
[02:47:04] <bud> imagine the fun you can have with 200M... https://0x0.st/oZ6U.png
[02:47:06] <topcat001> So the usage remains the same as the normal pager case (no arguments), which does have to hold the entire journal and hence must consume memory.
[02:47:42] <topcat001> I'm guessing; will be fun to check out the code.

[06:05:39] <bud> javascript -> typescript, feels nice, easy and right.

[13:54:51] <OneDev> So I use it from terminal

[13:55:32] <OneDev> becauuse it doesnt work. 
[13:55:51] <OneDev> I was writing here about that. I have some permission problem to connect from gnome panel

[13:56:46] <AlexC> but we don't know the actual problem
[13:57:02] <MrElendig> and so I take it that you disabled NetworkManager and are now using only iwd instead? If so, gnome doesn't support that so its network dialog won't do anything
[13:57:19] <AlexC> possible
[13:57:40] <cedb> OneDev: you mentionned three different network things: the gnome frontend, nm and iwd, like what is your actual problem ?
[13:57:49] <AlexC> roll with networkmanager, remove iwd enable nm, done

[18:41:56] <bud> so i got a reply (that wasn't spam) on my systemd issue regarding journalctl was using more than 200M when i used it for tail -f stuff.
[18:42:22] <bud> as i understand they get this issue reported quite frequently.
[18:42:34] <bud> > all journal IO in systemd/sd-journal is performed using mmap's shared file-backed (reclaimable) mappings
[18:42:46] <bud> > As a result you must subtract shared pages from the resident set size to get a real sense of the process-specific memory consumption.
[18:43:13] <bud> im not sure i know what they mean here or how to do this.
[18:43:33] <bud> > The decision to use mmap() IO with the journal has produced a lot of confusion in this area.

[18:49:05] <Khorne> ps -o cmd,rss,resident,size,share -C journalctl
[18:49:25] <Tom^> doesnt that just mean its mmaping in all the files hence you are using 200M because the files themself are loaded into memory and then released upon closure.
[18:49:45] <Tom^> so its not per se "journalctl" using 200M its the logs themself using it up.
[18:50:36] <bud> yeah, the logs where 1.5G combined. i purged them, and RAM usage dropped to ~10M or something.
[18:50:48] <Khorne> Of course it wasn't journalctl itself
[18:52:17] <bud> i don't care why or what really. i had 3 terminals open displaying logs like this and it was costing me ~500M RAM (it looked like in lxtask at least).

[19:47:13] <Jokler> Hey, after updating my linux-lts system on zfs-dkms yesterday I have to manually mount the zfs datasets and then get a kernel panic. I have tried to boot (non lts) linux, uninstalled nvidia-dkms, re-ran pacman -Syu as well as reinstalling a bunch of essential packages. Any ideas where I could go from here?
[19:47:26] <mewt> I have to take off for now, but please LMK if there is anything else I can do
[19:47:35] <mewt> I can also probably test the GPU

[23:10:46] <thurstylark> well, at least I know what pacman is saying, maybe you can weave it into your setup...
[23:11:06] <justkdng> the OBS is nice since it also takes care of building
[23:11:28] <justkdng> try building chromium in a cheap vps, it takes the OBS 4 hours on a 16 core cpu
[23:11:36] <thurstylark> pacman is comparing the checksum in the db with a checksum that's computed from the downloaded file. either the package changed and the repo db did not get updated, or vice versa
[23:12:36] <justkdng> one of my actions is to update the pacman database

[23:13:30] <thurstylark> that database file and the package file don't match up somehow

[23:14:07] <thurstylark> so whatever utility is generating that repo db file is probably not doing its job properly

[23:15:02] <justkdng> but then again if I install that package in my box it works, so I don't think the OBS is the problem
