[12:22:36] <DiffieHellman> If the source is available, there is a slight improvement in security as no-one is meant to see proprietary source. Proprietary code is often garbage and full of security buts.

[12:23:45] <DiffieHellman> Damn.
[12:24:14] <kompowiec2[x]> unfortunately this is due to the lack of a printer.
[12:25:13] <DiffieHellman> No proprietary program can be verified to be secure unless you've gone through every line of that machine code/representation. Meanwhile, free software programs can be verified to be secure and it's possible to fix any security bugs that you find.

[12:27:48] <DiffieHellman> Or made a replacement board for existing printer hardware

[12:33:30] <TJ-> the issue with printers is they're not built on a common base. openwrt routers are possible because the original code either already had a linux kernel (and therefore drivers) or uses a chipset and hardware Linux has drivers for so a proprietary OS can be replaced

[13:20:35] <DiffieHellman> TJ-: Yes, the problem with printers is that everyone writes their own special driver, printer OS and custom hardware that of course fails at random times. Despite how IPP's isn't that good, it's a solution that just works, but of course plenty still decide not to support IPP... OpenWRT is a thing because most routers use u-boot, flavours of a well know ARM SoC and the same (sadly usually nonfree)
[13:20:36] <DiffieHellman> wireless chipsets, so you just need to compile for that target and slap in some binary blobs and then it works better than the supplied vendor OS. Printers are up a level, since you need to tear out the crappy computer inside, figure out how to drive all the parts and then put in your own computer - which is a lot to do.
