[00:19:24] <gp5st> if my composer.json has an http url, why does the composer.lock have an ssh url?
[00:21:49] <AllenJB> gp5st: What exact URLs are you talking about?
[00:22:20] <gp5st> I have a repository and the url is https://github.com/...., but the lock file has git@github.com:....

[00:24:09] <AllenJB> If you're talking about the "homepage" URL in composer.json, I don't believe that has any influence on where / how the library is retrieved - it's for informational purposes and doesn't even have to be a GIT repo
[00:25:31] <da_wunder> I think that gp5st means that he/she is using eg. some fork where you define that repository url to composer.json - and I think that internally composer will use that git url and that is stored to lock file
[00:26:06] <gp5st> yes
[00:26:12] <gp5st> sounds similar to https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/3876
[00:28:31] <Sammitch> IIRC the repo url is for a _composer_ repo, eg where to find the metadata, and the url in composer.lock is where it was actually checked out from.
[00:28:43] <Sammitch> and checking out via ssh is objectively better
[00:29:26] <gp5st> it's not objectivly better to override what has been explicitly put into the config file
[00:32:23] <da_wunder> gp5st: then raise an issue about that to composer repository
[00:38:27] <Sammitch> do you have an _actual_ reason to care about this, or are you just huffy that your will has been defied by some composer nerd?
[00:40:20] <da_wunder> and really I think that there is reason for that behaviour - so if you create an issue to composer repository, I bet that someone composer core devs will explain that
[00:46:45] <AllenJB> You could try deleting vendor and composer.lock and rebuilding them from scratch (IIRC composer also keeps a local per-user cache which could affect things - might want to try finding and deleting that too if issues persist)

[01:54:45] <Sammitch> is that a question? a statement? an accidental copy/paste?
[01:55:09] <gp5st> you asked why it matters. it matters because of how auth is configured
[01:56:21] <Sammitch> oh well then that's easy. you _HAVE_ to change to SSH because github is getting rid of password-based auth in the near future.
[01:57:29] <Sammitch> so if you want to check out from a private repo, you need to set up ssh keys

[02:07:01] <Sammitch> if you delete /vendor and reinstall does it still switch out the URL?

[05:12:24] <Blondie101010> what?
[05:13:19] <Blondie101010> first of all, the parameters are to define the output format you want, not the input
[05:13:50] <Blondie101010> the input is PHP
[05:14:03] <whoever> some where I got the idea number_formatt() would also parse the number  from hte string so that I wouldn't have to type cast
[05:14:23] <Blondie101010> how does the type matter here?
[05:14:37] <Blondie101010> 5.22 is the same as "5.22" for this and most operations
[05:15:44] <whoever> because  it would either use . or , as the seperator  so if the passed value was 1.000 I could get 1000 useing , or . as the seperator

[07:40:00] <relipse> never gonna block it now to keep it backwards compatible
[07:40:20] <__adrian> it's intentional. it will never be removed.
[07:41:07] <Rockwood> __adrian, hi how are you sir?
[07:41:14] <__adrian> hi
[07:43:54] <Byteflux> There's in-fact a few features that encourage or rely on being able to get/set unknown properties such as __get() and __set().
[07:44:41] <Blondie101010> that is almost the opposite
[07:45:52] <Blondie101010> any proper __get() and __set() operate on a strict list
[07:46:31] <Blondie101010> you can't leave it unfiltered
[07:46:35] <Byteflux> Disagree, that's a fairly rigid definition of "proper"
[07:46:59] <Blondie101010> hmmm, what kind of example are you thinking about?
[07:47:33] <Blondie101010> why would you need these to allow public properties?
[07:47:56] <Blondie101010> to make them read-only?
[07:48:26] <Byteflux> It could be any arbitrary property (re: not a strict list of names) where the goal is simply to allow dynamic accessors for whatever reason.
[07:49:24] *** Joins: guidoc (~guido@151.43.43.235)
[07:49:38] <Blondie101010> if the object has a real purpose, it will have its own real properties
[07:49:44] <Blondie101010> so you need to protect them
[07:51:20] <Byteflux> Personally I agree about being explicit, but object behavior is nothing more than an agreement and I don't necessarily think what you advocate is necessarily the best or only way to be "proper"
[07:52:16] <Blondie101010> ok I'll agree that it may not always be the best or only way
[07:52:24] <Byteflux> __set()/__get() with arbitrary/undefined properties doesn't automatically equate to bad design.
[07:52:35] <Blondie101010> it's a bad start
[07:54:45] *** Quits: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna) (Quit: Leaving)
[08:02:18] <__adrian> undefined, sure. but i've never seen a design with arbitrary/"dynamic" __get/__set functionality that was anything but a dumpster.
[08:03:09] <Byteflux> I think the biggest drawback is you don't get static analysis :P
[08:03:41] <__adrian> indeed. and by extension, you don't get behavior that you can reliably reason about.
[08:06:52] <Byteflux> You could use __set() to enforce a relipse's suggested policy of disallowing setting undefined properties, ofc it's a waste of time to do so.
[08:07:47] <__adrian> that would be better implemented as a dedicated setter. for validation, __set() should simply dispatch to the real setter, else you'll end up with a "god" method
[08:08:15] <__adrian> and that ^ is only if, for some reason, you want to pretend you're setting the property directly.
[08:09:11] <__adrian> which i "get," and would be fine if magic wasn't so much more expensive than not-magic
[08:09:36] <Byteflux> Right, I don't think anyone actually wants the verbosity of accessor methods.
[08:09:44] <__adrian> oh hell, i do
[08:09:46] <Byteflux> Too bad you sacrifice too much using magic methods.
[08:10:14] <Blondie101010> Byteflux:  I love magic methods, much more than adrian
[08:10:21] <Blondie101010> but you need to structure your design
[08:12:08] <Blondie101010> my __get() and __set() mostly always follow the same pattern of using a switch..case
