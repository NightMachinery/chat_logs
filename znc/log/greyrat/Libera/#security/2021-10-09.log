[03:25:41] <nucleargrave> Hey, I apologize in advance for the long message. I am currently trying to build an authentication mechanism for a VR based client application. In this system,the user experience cannot involve login. There is a web platform where an instructor will need to register VR headsets by serial number. Once a VR headset is registered, I'd like a safe secure mechanism for every headset to talk to a web
[03:25:43] <nucleargrave> based API. One solution we have is for the instructor to register each headset in the VR client, which would be extremely cumbersome and manual and for N headsets per course (say 100?) the instructor would need to do a custom authentication process, but it would be secure. I however do not want to require the instructor to do this. To me, the ideal would be to load in a spreadsheet containing
[03:25:45] <nucleargrave> headset serial numbers into a class and this would automatically enable the headsets. With this approach, I'm very concerned with spoofing, so I'm trying to devise a system using cryptographic signing magic. I am wondering if it is safe for example to have an application level client id shared by all instances of the application. Using this client id, I'd like to do some sort of auth dance
[03:25:47] <nucleargrave> against a server to actually get an API key, but it has to be unique per headset serial number. I was thinking each client application sends over the client id  and a client side generated nonce value as well as the headset serial number. The server would make sure that the payload is valid and the client id at least corresponds to some client secret pair? With the headset serial is enabled the
[03:25:49] <nucleargrave> server can then return a token that could be used for all subsequent requests and the client (or server) can generate a nonce value to be attached to each request. I'm no security expert, so I'm wondering how this could be exploited and if I am reinventing the wheel. I've seen approaches where Sha256+hmac + nonce is used, but in this case each application instance also had their own client id. In
[03:25:51] <nucleargrave> my case, it would be impossible to set a client id per app instance without making the client generate a client ID at build time (maybe this is a better option) but then that client id is then stored as a file, which to me sounds less secure which is why I'd like to have a generic application ID if possible. I greatly appreciate the help for those that read this, any direction or advice would be
[03:25:53] <nucleargrave> super appreciated as I've never had to do something like this before and I have never had to support VR clients.

[05:03:43] <sartan> my darkest age was in 2003 or 2004 when i had an old sparcstation ultra 10 in the colo at the job i worked for.  i idled on some channels on efnet, and some skiddies wanted to do a channel takeover so they ddos'd everyone on the channel. i got a call at 4AM one night from the noc wondering why i was taking a few gigs of incoming traffic to my IP.  Since then have tried to avoid ircing from any real IP
[05:04:14] <sartan> that sparcstation never went down, impressive

[05:12:49] <sartan> cloaks and sasl are both very nice
[05:13:00] <sartan> i foudn ways to decloak on freenode, some opers found me trying a POC and I got a bit of a talking to :P
[05:13:09] <sartan> oftc probably just as vulnerable
[05:13:31] <sartan> So don't think it makes you invicible! :P
[05:15:09] <ghostbuster> i use one of the big cloud providers, i wonder how they would handle a ddos lol
[05:15:28] <sartan> i pay linode 60 bucks a month for a factorio server i may as well irc from it
[05:15:57] <ghostbuster> that's pricey eh
[05:16:00] <ghostbuster> beefy box?
[05:16:07] <sartan> yeah, fastest single core cpu i can buy
[05:16:13] <sartan> it's a pretty big map
[05:16:26] <sartan> it runs at 100% CPU when we're playing too. dedicated cpu, 16 gigs of ram

[20:39:42] <ghostbuster> i like mikrotik but i'm not sure i agree with this: "Allowing access to the device using untagged traffic is not considered a good security practice, a much better way is to allow access to the device using a very specific VLAN sometimes called the management VLAN, in our case, this is going to be VLAN99. This adds a significant layer of security since an attacker must guess the VLAN ID that is
[20:39:45] <ghostbuster> being used for management purposes and then guess the login credentials, [...]"
[20:40:55] <Apachez> omg
[20:41:07] <Apachez> no the attacker doesnt need to guess that
[20:41:35] <Apachez> just connect to the interface and run tcpdump and you will see the vlanid the device tags outgoing frames with
[20:42:41] <ghostbuster> Apachez: well that's only if someone is actively using the management vlan, right?
[20:43:38] <ghostbuster> still though, if you know that the router will accept connections on a certain port, then wouldn't you just need to send 4096 syn packets, one per VLAN id, and see which one come back with SYN/ACK?

[21:38:16] <Hydragyrum> the movie being on imdb isn't the issue
[21:38:28] <Hash> I honestly told exactly what I did. You were offensive, racist, and homophobic, and I reported you to jess and Hydragyrum
[21:38:31] <Apachez> so the 3 lines that Hash sad is the issue then?

[22:20:13] <Apachez> on the funny note is that Taiwan is TAA compliant but Malaysia isnt
[22:20:29] <Apachez> funny because Taiwan is considered to be part of China by many countries (incl China themselves)
[22:20:56] <Apachez> its only 20 or so countries who have acknowledged Taiwan to be its own country in the UN
[22:21:16] <Apachez> and 99% of the Cisco gear is made in taiwan... so there is that :P
