[02:58:39] <droid3> Ok so assuming we know that a quadratic root is possible aka quadratic residue exist we can use Cipolla, Pocklington's , or Tonelliâ€“Shanks. To find the roots of it.
[02:59:16] <webNET4> you assume i even know what a quadratic root is
[02:59:19] <droid3> My question is what algorithms do we currently have for solving the cubic root given we know the cubic residue exists.
[03:00:29] <edgar-rft> roots usually have more organic shapes, they are rather seldom quadratic
[03:01:07] <droid3> It seems most of are computer algorithms are for quadratic residues. I was currently wondering if we had any algorithms that work well for nth residuosity to find the nth roots of a number.

[03:09:30] <pyzozord> or at least methematical enough

[07:51:39] <edgar-rft> In the long run it pays off to learn emacs or vim, but it's true, both require some learning first. Emacs has a built-in tutorial that gets you started within approx 30 minutes.
[07:56:38] <arahael> I think learning any editor well is good. emacs and vim have proven to withstand the test of time, and are extremely extensible, so both are good. Otherwise, eg, notepad++ or vscode would be good, except the former only runs on windnows, and the latter hasn't yet stood the test of time so given another decade it'll probably be quite different.

[08:33:29] <edgar-rft> soulisson: depends on the language, but usually not
[08:33:43] <Burkuf> soulisson: OOP doesn't really care either way...
[08:36:51] <soulisson> ok, I'm asking because the wikipedia page in my native language says that instantiation is made of 2 operations: allocation and initialisation

[08:45:58] <soulisson> edgar-rft, ok, so I understand you correctly, there is the instantiation and then there is the initialization?
[08:46:13] <soulisson> *if
[08:47:07] <edgar-rft> right, the instantiation comes *before* the initialisation
[08:47:14] <PlanckWalk> IMO, instantiation refers to everything up to "this object is now usable by the code"
[08:48:00] <PlanckWalk> Some objects may have multiple initialization steps, but at least one during instantiation.
[08:49:06] <PlanckWalk> Hmm, I suppose an empty object might not need initialization.
[08:49:22] <PlanckWalk> e.g. "class Empty { }"
[08:49:43] <PlanckWalk> You can instantiate that without initialization since there's nothing to initialize.
[08:52:00] <edgar-rft> hmm, in Common Lisp make-instance and initialize-instance are two completely separate things, what is of course not necessarily true for *all* OOP languages

[08:52:53] <PlanckWalk> Isn't initialize-instance called by make-instance?
[08:54:00] <PlanckWalk> Though I guess you can change that
[08:54:35] <PlanckWalk> (But if you do, does it still correspond to OOP instantiation?)
[08:55:15] <edgar-rft> yes, but you can change that (must lookup the details myself) but I generally agree that "instantiation" is the overall term, that *might* include initialisation
[08:56:07] <edgar-rft> we need some computer theory specification lawyer :-)
[08:56:33] <PlanckWalk> Eh, just some common agreement on terminology would be nice sometimes.
[08:58:05] <edgar-rft> we should rather be happy that OOP doesn't enforce message-passing anymore :-)
[08:58:17] <soulisson> so instantiation = allocation + initialization (if there is a constructor)?
[08:58:59] <PlanckWalk> Everything between definite nonexistence up to the point where you can call methods on it seems like instantiation to me.
[08:59:21] <PlanckWalk> So yes, you can in some implementations have half-instantiated objects.

[08:59:34] <edgar-rft> soulisson: the practical problem is that many languages implement OOP very differently, not all languages require a constructor for example

[09:00:31] <PlanckWalk> So is initialization
[09:00:55] <PlanckWalk> Construction can be part of initialization, or a separate third step

[15:47:12] <beaky> pypy is a JIT-based python runtime that will be able to help execute python code faster
[15:47:23] <Gamah> I want to be as generic as possible when asking a question like this
[15:47:36] <arahael> Gamah: Python is *remarkably* easy to profiler and optimise.  YOu could write just that tiny bit in say, cython.

[15:49:22] <arahael> Gamah: Cython is almost C.
[15:49:37] <Gamah> It's a simple game so I don't really see any advantage of sticking with python.....I also really hate all the whitespace semantics. 
[15:49:44] <arahael> Gamah: And infact, you can run it in a mode that will output an HTML page that explains exactly how many lines of C a given cython line results in.
[15:50:06] <pyzozord> card game doesn't seem outside of reach of python
[15:50:09] <Gamah> I'm not afraid of using other langs.... 
[15:50:31] <arahael> Gamah: In that case, rewrite it in Rust. And again in C++, just for kicks.
[15:50:40] <Gamah> pyzozord: Not a game to be played but to be run dozens of millions of times
[15:50:51] <Gamah> arahael: lol
[15:51:00] <Gamah> So rust first?
[15:51:11] <piou> Gamah: don't be afraid, but on the other hand getting pypy and doing "pypy my_simulation.py" takes so little time in comparison that it would surely be foolish not to try that first and see if it gets you there

[15:52:40] <pyzozord> data crunching directly in python is a bad idea indeed
[15:52:55] <Gamah> So you can see my reasoning :)
[15:53:44] <pyzozord> But using a library designed for that lik numpy or pandas is very practical
[15:53:56] <Gamah> I can link a repo if anyone is actually interested in trying to convince me to use pypy or cython. But it's really boring I promise
[15:54:06] <piou> Gamah: what pyzozord is saying is that good python libraries exist for data crunching that will give you good results, but the standard library (import random etc) just isn't designed for that
[15:54:12] <Gamah> pyzozord: but I hate python anyway so I might as well move away from it
[15:54:31] <piou> Gamah: pypy is too simple not to try, you litterally have nothing to change
[15:54:35] <Gamah> Need to generate the data before crunching it, too..
[15:54:50] <mobidrop> I wrote my own AI once to train on snake in Rust and it ran tens of millions of games a second
[15:54:52] <pyzozord> Gamah: thas ok, but then you just want to try other languages for fun for your project. That's a similar but different problem. Then question is what do you want to get from trying out a new language
[15:55:04] <piou> If you don't want to use python, that's fair, but you've already written it
[15:55:06] <Gamah> piou: if you wanna run it and tell me it's 10x faster I'm down to believe you but I'm on my phone at the moment

[18:49:12] <DPA> File permissions is 1 set of user, group, others permissions, plus which user and groups. ACLs allow adding & removing permissions for additional users & groups, but limited still by the file permission mask, I think.
[18:49:13] <Izem> Does that mean unix or linux has various ways of controlling files?
[18:50:00] <Stefan26> isn't ACL/'access control list' an abstract concept that can be used to refer to more than file permission... like say a telephony system could have an ACL describing who's allowed to do what with a call, e.g. 073111/Alice: transfer, record; 073222/Bob: transfer
[18:50:16] <mobidrop> pyzozord, if you overperform then other devs look like they're slacking off (which they might be) so now everybody's got to work more
[18:50:24] <merijn> Stefan26: Yes, but also, it refers to some specific ACL implementation that exists in linux
[18:50:25] <Stefan26> yup wiki describes it as: In computer security, an access-control list (ACL) is a list of permissions associated with a system resource (object).

[20:22:31] <pyzozord> pulse: that's why I suggested svg
[20:22:38] <vdamewood> pulse: graphs and diagrans are prime candidates for vector graphics.
[20:22:40] <pulse> svg is fine but sometimes you need raster
[20:22:46] <sjmulder> man is great. esp. mdoc, which is semantic

[20:23:11] <pulse> vdamewood, yeah, i guess
[20:23:12] <sjmulder> maybe it would be good if Linux distros shipped a reasonable GUI man reader though

[20:24:26] <vdamewood> pyzozord: I would allow styling though, but not in the document itself. It would be a per-user configuration.

[20:26:10] <pyzozord> I would allow customizations but not in the format itself. The document browser program could apply styles on it's own merits
[20:26:12] <vdamewood> So, I could set all of the documentation I read to white on black, with 14-pt text. (My eyes suck, and glasses can't get me to 20/20 or 6/6)
[20:26:21] <sjmulder> hence you need semantic markup

[20:27:37] <pyzozord> Byt clients can interprete the semantics and render them with customisations however they please
[20:27:44] <sjmulder> and look at e.g. https://man.openbsd.org/strftime, that HTML output is just fine, but it can also be used well from the terminal or even as PDF
[20:27:58] <oldlaptop> perversely, firefox's "reader mode" can't just interpret semantic markup, it has to have all sorts of heuristic bullshit to guess the semantics of non-semantically-marked-up pages
[20:28:08] <sjmulder> what's lacking is a good, customizable GUI reader for folks who prefer that over the terminal
[20:28:13] <oldlaptop> which seem to convince it to ignore the actual semantics specified by the markup sometimes
[20:28:25] <vdamewood> Yeah, The OpenBSD crew really know how to do documentation.
[20:28:48] <sjmulder> true vdamewood, but I was also talking about the mdoc format in general
[20:28:56] <oldlaptop> schwarze@ specifically seems to spend a lot of time thinking about formatting and markup for documentation (i.e. mdoc(7))
[20:28:57] <sjmulder> it's semantic, multi-output, and out there already

[20:29:56] <sjmulder> oldlaptop, yeah I've been hacking on the mandoc code, it's good work

[23:28:35] <mrig> What would you say is the simplest way to pick up the stderr stream from a program that is running in the terminal and you do not want the errors to go to that terminal?
[23:29:09] <GeDaMo> Redirect to a file?

[23:29:43] <mrig> I was thinking that I could just pipe errors to a file, and read that with less but was wondering if I can watch the stderr file pointer instead.
[23:30:00] <mrig> with tail rather.

[23:30:29] <mrig> can I then read from dev/null with tail or something like that:
[23:30:31] <mrig> ?
[23:30:49] <mrig> cool that will be great if I can rater than making the file.
[23:30:59] <dodo> no, /dev/null is a black hole
[23:31:01] <jeaye> No, you just said that you didn't want it to go to terminal.
[23:31:14] <jeaye> What do you actually want with stdout and stderr?
[23:31:16] <GeDaMo> Can you redirect to a named pipe?
[23:32:35] <GeDaMo> It seems the answer is yes

[23:32:59] <vdamewood> I named the pipe under my sink Dave.
[23:34:43] <mrig> jeaye: I would like to read it in another terminal
[23:35:12] <mrig> stdout is displaying data to the terminal that I would like not to disturb whilst debugging.
[23:35:40] <mrig> GeDaMo: oh great, so I need to name the pipe then!
[23:35:53] <mrig> I mean they are files anyhow.
[23:36:32] <GeDaMo> I think you need to be reading from the pipe otherwise the writer will block
