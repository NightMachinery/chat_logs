[04:44:45] <lalia> o/ Evenin
[04:45:38] <lalia> Get to sit for a few minutes.
[04:49:08] <lalia> Might review my notes on Plato's works focused on the pursuit of virtue. Thinking about digging around the secondary lit for essays on the role of piety in the pursuit of virtue for Plato.
[04:49:54] <lalia> I bet I have a paper or two I could patch together in that area, but I haven't kept tabs on the relevant topics for a while. :)
[04:50:58] *** Joins: de-facto (~de-facto@user/de-facto)
[04:51:33] <lalia> My guess is I'll be reading an essay or two by Vlastos and Woodruff at the very least.
[05:08:58] <arryana> cool
[05:22:48] *** Quits: CuddlePup (~cuddlepup@user/cuddlepup) (Quit: CuddlePup)
[05:24:06] <lalia> It's an interesting focal area because the pursuit of virtue for Plato is a foundational pillar for a variety of wisdom traditions like Stoicism and Cynicism.
[05:26:09] *** Quits: shibboleth (~shibbolet@gateway/tor-sasl/shibboleth) (Quit: shibboleth)
[05:26:09] <lalia> So the function of piety in Athens and the commentary in the dialogues serve to inform the way observing holy practices and standards is meant to work for Plato in terms of acquiring virtue.
[05:26:34] <evolv> there has been an uptick in those interested in Stoicism pursuing Buddhism
[05:26:46] *** Quits: pucara (~i@181.95.206.31) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[05:27:00] <evolv> I have associated the uptick in self-proclaim Stoics to the likes of Jordan Peterson and other dark webbers
[05:27:26] <lalia> In Plato's works, the sincere pursuit of virtue leads one to a state near to living perfection if it's done right.
[05:27:48] <lalia> I've heard a lot about stoicism from all over oddly.
[05:28:15] <lalia> Seems like self-control as a moral theme became real popular over the last decade again.
[05:28:32] <evolv> I didn't know much about it, as a result, Stoicism is negatively biased in my mind - perhaps unfairly
[05:29:01] <evolv> yes, that's it
[05:29:20] <evolv> self-control, individualism, but for shaky reasoning
[05:29:36] <evolv> an absence of compassion
[05:29:40] <evolv> or reduced

[05:31:03] <lalia> I don't identify as one but I'm fond of what I know about it and have a few friends that take stoicism real seriously. Seems like the pursuit of virtue has led some folks towards more stability among my extended friendlies. The key virtues in this case are named things like self-control, wisdom, justice, and courage. They can all be argued as having been derived from ancient Platonic studies too.
[05:31:18] <lalia> So it's fun for me to get into on the level of scholarship at least. :)

[05:34:56] <lalia> A serious virtue ethicist who wants to build an understanding of morality on a foundation of platonic or other eudaimonist conceptions of moral action needs to be able to aquire all the virtues in order to have any of them. Piety is meant to serve as a guide on my reading, because acting in accordance with the will of the gods for an Attic citizen would ideally lead one to the best sort of behavior as a citizen as well.
[05:36:13] <lalia> Not saying it maps perfectly into contemporary contexts, but it's a cool area inasmuch as it's a kep topic for understanding the differences between traditions like Stoicism and Cynicism where the pursuit of virtue holds arguably equal importance.

[05:37:40] <lalia> Anyhow... ancient Greek. Catch the fever. :P
[05:38:11] <Panther> Euripides shirts and you pay for them.
[05:38:38] <lalia> :D
[05:39:31] <Panther> I studied 17th century French dramatic lit for a while, which lead naturally to its roots in Greek drama.
[05:39:34] <lalia> Would be a great shirt or poster slogan for advertising his play the Bacchae. :D
[05:40:09] <lalia> I would buy a stylized Bacchae shirt with the slogan "Euripides shirts and you pay for them." written on it.
[05:40:10] <Panther> There ya go :)
[05:40:37] <Panther> You have the knack for merchandising. :)

[16:55:30] <choozy> Heyhey
[16:55:41] <choozy> Did freenode seize the ##philosophy channel?
[16:58:33] <alix> they've changed their ircd and done a full services reset
[16:58:51] <spruit11> world of warcraft. kind-of nice until to you get to the end content. big time waster you cannot even play nicely if you have a job
[16:58:56] <pussipupu> Freenode have trashed their account and channel registration databases
[16:59:01] <alix> so they may not have seized it per se. it would have just been registered by the first person to get in after the reset
[17:00:10] <amigojapan> I don't want to be in freenode anymore.i don't get why people are going back
[17:00:50] <pussipupu> I'm abandoning it, regretfully
[17:01:21] <spruit11> looks like the ops are killing of the network because reasons.  I didn't get it,  but decided when people who know about this stuff better than I do migrate,  so will I.
[17:02:06] <spruit11> maybe I even don't want to know but I already got turned off by the 'jobs' announcement.
[17:02:34] <spruit11> looks like someone is trying to monetize on it

[17:20:04] <spruit11> I don't remember him
[17:20:29] <lalia> He was the original founder of this channel around 16 years ago.
[17:20:40] <lalia> He stopped hanging out a few years back.
[17:20:56] <spruit11> oh,  right.  well audrey is still doing a fine job
[17:20:57] <lalia> Got his PhD and quit making time for online stuff.
[17:21:19] <spruit11> yah,  that often happens
[17:22:03] <lalia> Audrey has managed the ##philosophy for around seven years now, I think. Since Meeple split anyways.
[17:22:18] <lalia> I've run the channel with her for half of that time.
[17:22:28] <lalia> Been a rewarding ride. :)

[18:00:52] <lalia> In other news: Wish Dragon is the greatest of all Disney parodies. Aladdin is a super hateful piece of work they barely bothered to dress up as a musical kid's show. This movie is infinitely better and it spends a bunch of time directly mocking the other show... brilliant, IMO.
[18:01:45] *** Joins: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse)
[18:07:20] <pussipupu> Ah, a comrade in the jihad against Disney
[18:07:45] <spruit11> the materialist dialectic is always correct
[18:08:12] <arryana> who made wish dragon?
[18:08:40] <arryana> disney ruined pixar, sadly
[18:09:04] <spruit11> too much formulaic shit?
[18:09:55] <arryana> netflix's little prince is very well done
[18:10:00] <lalia> Columbia and Sony are the distributors. It's an adaptation of work by Chris Appelhans, who also wrote and directed the film.
[18:10:48] <spruit11> it's somehow the same for the game I play.  now we got vampires (sells),  angels (sells),  skeletons (sells),  and elves (sells).  most of it doesn't have a lot to do with the original story.
[18:11:10] <spruit11> they did it nicely but still.  artistic poverty.
[18:12:28] * arryana imdb's wish dragon
[18:12:46] <arryana> okay, that leads to the question, if you had three wishes, do you know what you'd wish for?
[18:13:23] <lalia> I'd wish to not have found the thing granting me wishes.
[18:13:32] <arryana> really?
[18:13:48] <lalia> Yep. That shit seems like a terrible thing for anyone to have.
[18:13:57] *** Quits: larkfisherman (~larkfishe@217.75.204.126) (Quit: Leaving)
[18:13:59] <arryana> it took me a very long time to decide what i'd pick
[18:14:07] <arryana> the first wish was the easiest
[18:15:21] <lalia> I spend too much time worrying about things like lasting consequences and cosmic repercussions, so I'd never be able to decide on anything anyways. :D
[18:15:28] <lalia> arryana: what would you pick?
[18:16:13] <arryana> ooh, wish dragon is on netflix
[18:16:28] <lalia> :3
[18:16:36] <arryana> the first wish would be a small box that has a single joint sized bud of weed and a rolling paper in it every time it is opened.
[18:17:17] <arryana> the second wish would be a wallet that has 300 bucks-ish in mixed bill local currency every time it's opened
[18:18:01] <arryana> i'm trying to decide if a lunchbox that has a single serving of whatever i ask it for is worth it.
[18:18:16] <arryana> but so far that's the forerunner wish
[18:24:40] <lalia> :D
[18:24:58] <lalia> Very clever, IMO. I like those a lot. :)
[18:24:59] <pussipupu> If I had three wishes, I'd wish for five, so I could breathe under water and still be alive
[18:25:04] <arryana> oooh
[18:25:11] <arryana> well, i'm a simple creature
[18:25:13] * pussipupu sings loudly
[18:25:18] <arryana> i have no interest in trying to change the world
[18:25:31] <arryana> and i have no need of wealth and less than no desire for fame
[18:26:02] <arryana> so... ultimate basic travel supplies, that's the most flexible and simple thing i can think of
[18:26:27] <arryana> the only thing it's missing is fire
[18:26:49] <arryana> but i can probably get away with that by ordering something flambe out of my lunchbox

[22:10:32] <blkshp> I still have access to the old ##philosophy, do you guys want me to close it with a forwarding message?
[22:11:10] <lalia> Ideally, yeah.
[22:11:21] <NewB> can you give me ops so I can ban you?
[22:11:42] <blkshp> NewB: this is a sad time. be less you! :P
[22:11:46] <lalia> but I wonder what audrey has to say too, blkshp. What do you think?
[22:12:05] <blkshp> Well it's not connectable to anyone that's disconnected so...
[22:12:07] <blkshp> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[22:12:30] <blkshp> it's down to 42 users
[22:12:59] <blkshp> do you know what happened in the last 12 hours lalia?
[22:13:21] <NewB> what's sad about it? all channels have moved to libera and freenode closed
[22:13:41] <NewB> no one is missing anything
[22:13:46] <lalia> I've caught chunks of news I've been able to cobble together some details with, blkshp. Like I saw the announcement sent out the other night.
[22:13:48] <blkshp> you get it or you dont!
[22:14:34] <blkshp> So freenode as it was is no more, people can no longer connect to it easily and a new freenode has come out of the ashes, basically all the old channels no longer exist (or rather are dripping to nothing)
[22:15:25] <NewB> actually I thought they lost channel registerations
[22:15:28] <lalia> Yeah, that's a decent summary of what I've gathered.
[22:15:38] <NewB> do you still have ownership in your channels?
[22:15:43] <pussipupu> And they're pushing anonymous channels
[22:15:44] <blkshp> ues
[22:15:49] <blkshp> yes
[22:15:53] <blkshp>  I have just closed English
[22:16:01] <pussipupu> because obviously what IRC needs is to be more like *chan
[22:16:03] <blkshp> I'm about to close Windows
[22:16:38] <NewB> at least they managed to back up the services, that's something
[22:16:49] <blkshp> What do you mean back up the services?
[22:16:50] <pussipupu> clever, try Solaris instead
[22:16:55] <voltage_> it's going to be closed down anyway, and the new freenode someone stole ##philosophy already
[22:16:57] <blkshp> There's nothing, it's a blank slate
[22:17:43] <voltage_> actually ## is unaviable (they set a ban on *!*@*) it's just #philosophy now
[22:18:25] *** Joins: [itchyjunk] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470)
[22:19:06] <NewB> blkshp: they were trying to switch to anope services I believe, they must have had the old services backed up to actually mentain channel and nickname registerations
[22:19:26] <blkshp> They didn't
[22:19:29] <voltage_> nope
[22:19:35] <blkshp> All channel and nick registrations were deleted.
[22:19:41] <NewB> why?
[22:19:41] <blkshp> or... not recreated.
[22:19:46] <blkshp> No one bloody knows.
[22:19:53] <blkshp> Even the other staff don';t know#
[22:19:59] <NewB> how is that possible?
[22:20:13] <voltage_> that's what andrew wished to do
[22:20:17] <NewB> if they were deleted you wouldn't have access to your channels
[22:20:21] <voltage_> burn everything down and rise from the ashes
[22:20:26] <voltage_> like phoenix
[22:20:27] <blkshp> well you change the routing for chat.freenode.org to a new system
[22:20:41] <blkshp> the old one is still there, im still on it (just) but you just can't connect to it anymore
[22:20:51] <voltage_> https://www.reddit.com/r/irc/comments/o01tmv/freenode_wipes_old_database_and_starts_over/h1sxy13/
[22:20:53] <ro-bot-o> [url] freenode wipes old database and starts over : irc | www.reddit.com
[22:21:31] <NewB> so they are still in the process of moving to Anope services
[22:21:44] <voltage_> you can connect through classic.freenode.net, but who knows for how long will they leave it open
[22:22:59] <NewB> are they keeping the network splitted?
[22:23:24] <voltage_> for now yeah
[22:23:47] <lalia> Nightmare. I'll take your lead, blkshp.
[22:24:05] <lalia> Happier here already anyways.
[22:24:24] <audrey> blkshp, yes please do if you have access
[22:25:31] <NewB> makes sense then, they will probably recover everything in some hours
[22:25:40] <pussipupu> this whole debacle might lead to something of a renaissance
[22:25:55] <pussipupu> "debacle" is a lovely word incidentally
[22:25:58] <NewB> though switching to a new ircd and services in such a big network isn't an easy task
[22:28:35] <blkshp> NewB: you don't get it, there is no recovery
[22:28:54] <blkshp> IF that were the case they would be overwriting the 10k that have registered. Its gone, over, done, finished, ended, complete.
[22:28:59] <blkshp> audrey: closed.
[22:29:03] <audrey> Thank you
[22:29:19] <audrey> Real shame things ended this ignominiously.
[22:30:05] <NewB> blkshp: if they manage to backup and restore all information everything will be back
[22:30:27] <lalia> I don't love it but most of my online social time is spent on Discord by virtue of the academic contacts I have there and the reading group servers I participate in. I'll be great to see how Libera progresses now that we're here. Maybe we'll be able to get more regular on-topic discussion or some kind of reading review. Who knows. :3

[22:37:35] <raincomplex> to me it looks like a classic case of "person with money swoops in and tries to control something they don't fully understand"
[22:38:04] <lalia> Sadly, this seems like a reasonable reading.
[22:38:23] <NewB> Lee owned freenode since 2017 actually
[22:39:18] <raincomplex> the ownership of freenode is an interesting topic, haha
[22:40:03] <raincomplex> it seems to me like a large part of the problem was the lack of communication on exactly what that entailed
[22:40:48] *** Quits: mikey (~mikey@user/mikey) (Quit: leaving)

[22:41:44] <[itchyjunk]> The old staff (current staff here) had some idea of what was going on but they preteded to play dumb.
[22:42:06] <[itchyjunk]> The ownership issue was brought up in irc and HN and they said they looked into it and there was no issue.
[22:42:23] <[itchyjunk]> Then, when shit went sour, they played dumb and said they had no idea.

[22:43:40] <raincomplex> i'm not interested in assigning blame
[22:43:57] <raincomplex> only in understanding
[22:44:26] <NewB> I don't think there was ever a miscommunication, everyone knew freenode was not owned by the people who were running it
[22:44:44] <[itchyjunk]> It's not blame.
[22:44:50] <[itchyjunk]> It is the understanding.
[22:44:58] <[itchyjunk]> Knowing who fucked up is part of it.
[22:45:13] <lalia> All I know is my channels all made the jump to Libera early on and it worked out great on this end. Everything on the Freenode end has been nothing but headaches for the past few weeks and they haven't bothered being considerate or helpful about it when asked what do to.
[22:45:19] <[itchyjunk]> Quite a few people knew about freenode ltd.
[22:45:23] <lalia> So.. I'm here for better or worse.
[22:45:27] <NewB> both sides are wrong for me, but well...
[22:45:32] <lalia> This channel is our deal now. :)
