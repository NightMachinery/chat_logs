[21:46:22] <temhawk> Have yous seen this? https://saagarjha.com/blog/2019/04/26/thoughts-on-macos-package-managers/ and what do you make of it?
[21:47:30] <temhawk> (specifically about the security holes)

[22:08:07] <quesker> just installed irssi on a new machine and alt-X where X is 1 2 3 etc is putting symbols instead of switching to that window.  also readline stuff doesn't seem to work  ctl-A ctl-E 
[22:40:49] <quesker> bash is messed up too.  is machomebrew dead now?  why are packages getting screwed up?
[22:51:02] <tdsmith> temhawk: unless you have multiple, mutually-untrusting users using your mac, the security hole is purely theoretical
[22:55:29] <quesker> ok the bash one was some dumb thing they changed in bash itself recently oops
[23:00:51] <quesker> well.  this is fun.  another bash issue    -bash: type: compopt: not found
[23:03:47] <tdsmith> quesker: i think compopt is a newer-bash thing so it sounds like maybe that's being emitted by system bash
[23:10:18] <quesker> oh wow.  I wonder how I ended up in system bash oops.  thanks
[23:11:22] <quesker> oh I didn't actually chsh to the brew one yet duh
