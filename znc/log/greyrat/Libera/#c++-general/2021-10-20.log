[00:15:09] <rpav> it's pretty simple iirc
[00:15:32] <rpav> like you could probably make it a member function or similar too if you want to type less, but
[00:15:40] <ville> he wanted struct aa { union { /* swizzles */ }; }; i expect
[00:15:46] <rpav> that sounds like UB
[00:15:50] <LiaoTao> ^
[00:16:12] <rpav> also not necessary and a lot more work than a swizzle template
[00:17:25] *** Quits: Leone (~Leo@216.154.21.17) ()
[00:17:48] <rpav> plus a union is only going to give you e.g. .xy or .yx for a vec2, not .xxyx or other combinations
[00:18:13] <rpav> also wait, a union isn't going to work even if you assume it works and ignore the UB
[00:18:26] <ville> they all share the same initial sequence so it's fine. or even layout cmpatible
[00:18:31] <rpav> no they won't
[00:18:53] <rpav> .yx would have to be an vec2_yx { float y, x; } instead of a vec2 { float x, y; }
[00:19:07] <ville> no it wouldn't have to have to be
[00:19:28] <ville> and it's types that mattter, not the names
[00:19:36] <rpav> really then how do you union `vec2 { float x, y; }` with another vec2 such that x and y are reversed ;)
[00:19:42] <ville> those two are layout compatible
[00:19:49] <whupdup> right, but you could union all ordered values with total size <= sizeof(your vec)
[00:20:01] <whupdup> so x, y, xy, yz, etc
[00:20:11] <rpav> this isn't going to work like you think
[00:20:30] <rpav> you're at a minimum going to need conversion routines then you might as well just use swizzle<Zs...>()
[00:21:58] <whupdup> also how would swizzle<...> work anyway?
[00:22:37] <rpav> first assume you have element<N>(T) and have specialized it for e.g. element<0>(vec v) { return v.x; } and the rest ought to be obvious
[00:22:57] <rpav> well
[00:23:24] <ville> swizzle<> function template or swizzle<> class template?
[00:23:37] <whupdup> oh, I thought it was something fancier
[00:23:49] <rpav> you also need a swizzle_type<N>() mapped to like, vec2/3/4
[00:24:47] <rpav> but then your swizzle<Zs...>(T v) is like, { swizzle_type<sizeof...(Zs)>::type(element<Zs>(v)...); }
[00:26:01] <rpav> throw in some auto and stuff and the actual decl is probably `template <typename T, size_t...Zs> auto swizzle() { ... }`
[00:26:17] <rpav> then of course `enum { X, Y, Z, W, ... };`
[00:26:40] <rpav> which you probably don't want spamming your global namespace, so you'll put inside something then decide it's too annoying to use and just use indices like i did, but ;)
[00:26:46] <rpav> it's _doable_!
[00:27:33] <rpav> also you can probably template your element<N>(T) so you only need like 4 actual definitions

[03:37:30] <c4017w> CRTP question now. There's no type to store a type right? How can I dynamically call the correct derived class here without a switch statement? https://wandbox.org/permlink/aZZXfHlDTHkmjVRB
[03:41:47] <computerquip> The idea is that you hold instances of Derived1 or Derived2 that gained common functionality defined in Base
[03:42:13] <computerquip> Your problem isn't to do with CRTP that I can see.
[03:43:31] <c4017w> But I'm calling a static method. I never actually instantiate any class

[03:59:35] <RandomReader> it's equivalent to just having global functions Handler1, Handler2 etc
[04:00:30] <RandomReader> where would the use of polymorphism or need for custom types come in?
[04:02:34] <RandomReader> (as for static vs dynamic, your use case has the input (and map if it were used) being dynamic, which means *static* polymorphism doesn't help, if that was the idea)
[04:04:58] <c4017w> In this simple example sure. What I'm trying to do is provide both a static and dynamic interface to a class. Dynamic would be `instance->Handle(...)`, static would be `className::Handle(...)`. The actual arguments come from user input, and I need to figure out which static class handler to call from that
[04:05:39] <c4017w> of course handlers are different for statuc and dynamic case, not `Handle` as I stated
[04:06:33] <computerquip> I thnk you're confusing some concepts here. CRTP doesn't use a dynamic anything, you're thinking of a virtual class.
[04:06:53] <computerquip> CRTP just calls into non-virtual non-static members of the derived class.
[04:07:16] <computerquip> Either way, both would require an instance of derived.
[04:07:35] *** Joins: jeho (~jehoshaph@user/jehoshaphat)
[04:07:56] <c4017w> no? virtual will only work on non-static, but the whole point of CRTP is that it can emulate polymorphism with static methods
[04:08:26] <computerquip> Look at this example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_metaprogramming#Static_polymorphism
[04:08:46] <c4017w> I have, and?
[04:08:53] <computerquip> Note the distinct lack of static methods.
[04:09:15] <RandomReader> "static polymorphism" in this case is the language of the type system, so templates .. it's not equivalent to what some languages would call an "interface"
[04:09:22] <c4017w> in the first block where they're showing normal inheritance?

[04:11:53] <c4017w> computerquip, Ah I confused it with this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_recurring_template_pattern#Static%20polymorphism
[04:12:49] <c4017w> which is what I'm trying to do
[04:13:19] <RandomReader> CRTP's typical use case is in having the base providing functionality, not a public interface
[04:14:41] <c4017w> RandomReader, I meant in terms of a user interface. Basically a single function that parses input and does stuff. It would be overridden in each of the derived classes
[04:15:06] *** Quits: PJBoy (~PJBoy@user/pjboy) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[04:15:24] <RandomReader> the example there has Base::static_func() doing important things, with a callback hook in the middle .. but since the relationship between Base and Derived is static, the hook can also be static
[04:15:39] <c4017w> and it has to be static to work for my case. In the past I just stored a list of the static handler functions of each derived class, but I though CRTP would be a neater way to achieve the same result
[04:15:42] <RandomReader> the non-CRTP alternative would be Derived::static_func() calling Base::pre_func() and Base::post_func()
[04:15:59] <RandomReader> the public interface in both cases is Derived::static_func(), not Base::static_func()
[04:16:35] <RandomReader> CRTP requires the Base have knowledge of the derived type, so Base:: doesn't even make sense
[04:16:39] <RandomReader> (from the outside)
[04:17:18] <RandomReader> if I understand correctly, that seems to be how you're thinking of this, to which I'd say it's just not a thing in C++
[04:17:40] <RandomReader> there are no overrides of static functions, because there is no polymorphic relationship between them
[04:17:49] <RandomReader> static interfaces in that sense just don't exist
[04:18:37] <RandomReader> so back to your example, you'd build the map with function pointers, same as you'd do without the classes at all
[04:20:00] <RandomReader> and in this particular example Base::Handler serves no purpose
[04:20:22] <RandomReader> you'd use Derived1:: etc scope identifiers, not Base<...>, since in this arrangement it's an implementation detail of Derived rather than a public interface
[04:21:04] <RandomReader> if Base::Handler has *common* functionality that then calls specific sub-functions in Derived, then it would become part of the public interface, but still accessed through Derived scope

[04:21:17] <RandomReader> there would never be functions of the same name in Derived

[04:34:29] <computerquip> Is basically how that would be used.
[04:35:41] <c4017w> I think that's pretty much what I need actually
[04:36:25] <c4017w> But now I'm not so sure I want to use CRTP anyway. Since I have a lot of derived classes, I would end up with copies of the base class functions for each type...
[04:37:17] <c4017w> Although most of the code in the base class doesn't care about the template type, I could probably refactor it out
[04:37:18] <yolo_> c4017w: move out from ctor does not help, do I really need make a reference to a string then use that in the func? let me try

[04:38:34] <c4017w> yolo_, ah possibly. I didn't think it was warning about the string

[04:38:54] <computerquip> You can also declare base a friend in your derived and then declare your members private so people who have an instance of derived can't call into functions you don't want them to.
[04:39:40] <computerquip> Also, "copies" is a strong word when it comes to templating. Compilers are often pretty smart at optimizing that stuff away.
[04:39:53] <computerquip> The hard part comes from making sure that they optimize it away.
[04:40:12] <computerquip> And debug information *can* get bloated.

[04:41:39] <RandomReader> this is rough, but might add a little to what you've already understood
[04:41:41] <RandomReader> https://wandbox.org/permlink/fGwhtLVrx5L6oijs
[04:42:13] <RandomReader> static vs not doesn't actually make a difference here, the intent was just to show the inversion of where the functionality lives, which is basically the point of CRTP as a technique
[04:42:42] <c4017w> How could templated functions get optimized if they refer to different types though? I haven't actually tried turning optimization on yet
[04:44:14] <computerquip> You'd have to look at the assembly output, it happens to be good at reducing repeated coded.
[04:44:18] <computerquip> code.*
[04:44:45] <computerquip> I'd imagine VC++ is actually fairly good with that since they've been using that technique since the 90s.
[04:45:00] <computerquip> they being Microsoft in things like ATL
[04:45:53] <c4017w> I don't think I've ever seen a compiler create more functions in an effort to refactor out repeated code from template functions, but I will certainly investigate
[04:46:07] <RandomReader> yolo_ - are you sure it's talking about testclk? it's hard to see through the macros there

[04:47:34] <yolo_> RandomReader: you're right, it's on SC_CTOR(Top) the ctor indeed
[04:47:35] <RandomReader> meaning I would think it might be applying to this module's constructor, and it's impossible to see what the first parameter is because it's hidden behind this SC_CTOR macro
[04:48:01] <RandomReader> ah, ok, I guessed right :D
[04:48:23] <RandomReader> since it's a macro this may not be one you fix, it might just need to be ignored
[04:48:41] <RandomReader> up to the SC people to change if it's important
[04:49:26] *** Gustavo6046_ is now known as Gustavo6046
[04:49:54] <yolo_> RandomReader: i think you're right, i was just paranoid to get rid of all warning, in thise case, it's really up to SC
[04:50:54] <yolo_> #define SC_CTOR(user_module_name) typedef user_module_name SC_CURRENT_USER_MODULE; user_module_name( ::sc_core::sc_module_name )
[04:50:55] <c4017w> Thanks everyone. It makes more sense now that I understand you still call everything via the derived class. I think as long as I can get the compiler not to duplicate base class code, this will work nicely. Will look into that tomorrow

[11:00:05] <Haohmaru> RandomReader
[11:00:14] <ville> that's the worst
[11:00:31] <ville> or if the reader/writer pairing is not to your liking then source/sink is an option
[11:00:34] <Haohmaru> nah, the worst would be RandomWriter

[11:02:57] <johnny> what would you call something that implies excel|csv|json|whatever . the non native format
[11:03:48] <Haohmaru> foreign_format_reader?
[11:04:10] <johnny> the codebase has functions unrelated to this specific importer like create_instruction_from_xlsx  (although it's really more like create_instruction_for_xlsx) so I have to genericize them anyways
[11:04:14] <ville> it presumably has a name?
[11:04:34] <johnny> foreign_format is indeed one way
[11:05:24] <ville> if the original authors of the format didn't give the format a name you can take the authors name{,s} and make a name based on that
[11:05:55] <ville> if it's output of a specific program, take that program's name
[11:06:01] <Haohmaru> or the name of $whatever it is that spews that format out (a program?)
[11:06:27] <johnny> the functions for the native format of the application were called things like  update_pointers_dat, create_instruction_from_dat , etc with .dat being the file extension
[11:06:45] <ville> then follow the same pattenr

[12:18:30] <LordKalma> the "inheriting" class (not really inheritance there but you know what I mean) don't have to assume the existence of a parent destructor to call
[12:19:11] <ville> they could just generate the definition even if that weren't true. c++ can't*

[13:28:12] <The_Jag_> TinoDidriksen Yes, I'm changing the file, but I'm changing the copy of it that is placed in the build folder by the Makefile
[13:28:56] <TinoDidriksen> Then later targets must use the build file, not the source file.
[13:29:23] <The_Jag_> I don't follow
[13:29:36] <TinoDidriksen> The difference between $(abs_srcdir) and $(abs_builddir)
[13:30:06] <LiaoTao> The_Jag_, Try generating a new file with a single definition corresponding to the build number and register it as a dependency in the build system
[13:30:32] <LiaoTao> That way you don't have to alter your overall source code
[13:30:48] <LiaoTao> Which I assume is what you're trying to do by only altering the copy scheduled to build
[13:30:50] <TinoDidriksen> Normally file references are relative to the srcdir. You need to depend on a file in the builddir instead, so change the relevant file.cpp reference to $(abs_builddir)/file.cpp
[13:31:36] <The_Jag_> TinoDidriksen I am changing that file, not the original file
[13:32:07] <TinoDidriksen> Yes
[13:32:49] <The_Jag_> LiaoTao I need to do that within eclipse, which automatically generates the makefile

[13:40:23] <ville> The_Jag_: in make have a rule that does the version numbder change. then say that your rule that creates the object file depends on the rule that does the version number change
[13:41:01] <TinoDidriksen> If you can't manually change the Makefile at all, then I guess ask an Eclipse channel. It's not make related any longer then.
[13:41:22] <TinoDidriksen> Either take control of the build, or ask Eclipse people how to make Eclipse do what you want.
[13:41:24] <The_Jag_> TinoDidriksen My issue is that if the file in the builddir is changed, the rule that compiles, will refetch the original from srcdir, is that correct?

[13:42:10] <TinoDidriksen> A build should never change source file anyway.
[13:42:46] <TinoDidriksen> So yes, it should and will copy from source to build folder and change only the build copy.

[13:46:05] <The_Jag_> I need to update that number at each build, so I came up with this solution: in the header, I have a placeholder, then, before compiling, I substitute that placeholder in the header (inside the builddir, not the srcdir)
[13:46:07] <TinoDidriksen> You CAN do what you want, but I fundamentally question WHY you want to do it. The source should be involatile. All such build versioning should be in the build system's own tracking.

[16:21:24] <paule32> i call a c function from pascal
[16:21:48] <mort> a C function or a C++ function?
[16:22:35] <mort> I don't know microsoft's C ABI, I would be surprised if all functions in their ABI have a hidden first parameter, but I've been surprised before so I'm not saying it's incorrect
[16:22:43] <paule32> and under windows: function pascalfunc(s: String): string; external 'foo';  -> in C foo(void*h, char *str) { }

[16:23:05] <mort> oh, pascal functions take a hidden first parameter
[16:23:11] <paule32> yes
[16:23:26] <rpav> oh weird pascal, interesting
[16:23:45] <rpav> what's the hidden parameter represent?
[16:24:01] <paule32> a pointer to the parameter
[16:24:05] <mort> so is your problem is that if you just type something like `foo("hello")` in pascal, it generates a call to a function `foo(void *, char *)` rather than a function `foo(char *)`?
[16:24:35] <rpav> like the pascal data type? is there one for every parameter?
[16:24:49] <paule32> only one
[16:25:37] <paule32> mort, the call to c function foo(void*,char*) is fine
[16:25:51] <paule32> back backward, return to the pascal caller
[16:26:09] <paule32> like:  Length(UpperCase('moo'));
[16:26:51] <paule32> in C -> char* UpperCase(void *hidden, char *str) { }
[16:27:00] <rpav> wait is this contiuation passing style? UpperCase(&Length, 'moo')?
[16:27:31] <rpav> (though the actual continuation wouldn't be exactly that of course)
[16:28:11] <paule32> now me this hidden parameter is my problem under windows
[16:29:02] <mort> paule32: I would probably look into documentation specific to C FFI from Pascal
[16:29:20] <paule32> in C -> UpperCase(void *h, char *str) { return (char*)Upper(str); }  in Pascal -> Upper is empty
[16:30:53] <mort> I don't think I will ever understand why `foo ## __COUNTER__` doesn't work but `PASTE(foo, __COUNTER__)` works when PASTE(x, y) is defined as `PASTE2(x, y)` and PASTE2(x, y) is defined as `x ## y`

They do NOT provide the guarantee: if two hash values are the same, the two objects are equal. That is, your two sets produce the same hash, then you still need to loop through the two sets to check if each element is actually equal. If you want a hash function
[17:59:38] <Alipha> that will guarantee object equality if the hash values are equal, then you need to use a cryptographic hash, such as sha256. SipHash is not sufficient. Also, regardless, I'd recommend storing the result of the hash so that you don't have to constantly recompute it.

[19:12:59] <rond_> rpav https://paste.mozilla.org/X434yWQ7#L4,6,6   what more can I say? I want to use Workers in iterations, and for them to survive between one and the other iteration
[19:13:17] <rpav> you need to answer the above questions
[19:13:38] <rond_> originalOne shouldn't be modified/destroyed, hence const&.  you are correct about the newWorker's behavior
[19:14:00] <rpav> then you have a slightly inconsistent model
[19:14:08] <rond_> what do you mean?
[19:14:37] <rpav> the way you're treating `worker` wants to assume it gets destroyed after an iteration, but `originalOne` is a special case
[19:14:57] <rpav> you could handle that with an adjustment but it's unclear how good this is
[19:15:38] <rpav> but, e.g., `foo(const A& original) { const A* worker = &original; unique_ptr<A> next; /* currently none */ ...`

[19:17:48] <rond_> I cannot init unique_ptr<A> next   with original, hence 2 pointers, right?
[19:18:14] <rpav> right
[19:18:53] <rpav> you are _not_ acquiring ownership of the original, but you want to make a bunch of short-lived extras or something

[21:02:41] <paule32> that = 1

[23:14:07] <LordKalma> already, already crash landed
[23:14:08] <rpav> dunno the last time firefox was good was like, when IE was the competition
[23:14:25] <rpav> maybe early chrome when firefox still had real extensions
[23:14:43] <ville> LordKalma: windows
[23:14:46] <ville> ?
[23:15:08] <TheGuestMovie> The issue is that Mozilla is basically a SF tech giant company. Maybe they shouldn't be due to being poorer, but in mentality and geography, they are Google, they are Netflix
[23:15:31] <TheGuestMovie> They waste their money on salaries to non-techie trustfund kids that do "Evangelism"
[23:15:41] <LordKalma> ville, yes, why?
[23:15:46] <TheGuestMovie> they focus on copying Google, who their employees just worship
[23:16:01] <LordKalma> like CEO getting 300% raises? :D
[23:16:02] <TheGuestMovie> that's why their devs added Google Analytics to the Addon store a while back. They just don't get it.
[23:16:10] <LordKalma> and cutting the whole security team? :D
[23:16:24] <LordKalma> and I can't find the citation
[23:16:33] <ville> LordKalma: wondering if they've then turned on some feature for windows population. at least for me i can still shift-del entries and they won't show up any more
[23:16:51] <TheGuestMovie> basically you think of Mozilla as this ideological overweight bald German who gave his all to open-source all his life, but really they're as corporate as Google
[23:16:58] <LordKalma> but apparently the mozilla company and the foundation have different bank accounts so to speak
[23:17:10] <LordKalma> and so the money the foundation gets doesn't pay firefox
[23:17:16] <LordKalma> only the google money pays for firefox
[23:17:23] <m_ben> what is a good alternative to firefox?
[23:17:24] <LordKalma> the foundation money is for, as you said, the evangelism
[23:17:29] <ville> LordKalma: how did you delete the entry?
[23:17:34] <rpav> there is basically chrome
[23:17:40] <LordKalma> ville, ctrl shift delete, of course, as always
[23:17:44] <rpav> there are some chromium forks that are decent
[23:18:00] <TheGuestMovie> I canceled my donations because it was impossible for me to make sure my money went to Firefox and other tech development and nothing else, and not the salaries of privileged people in all non-tech roles.
[23:18:06] <LordKalma> but this: https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/08/mozilla_adding_sponsored_search_results/
[23:18:12] <ville> LordKalma: shift-del?
[23:18:19] <hnOsmium0001> I just want firefox to support PWA on desktop
[23:18:23] <LordKalma> is literally giving me back results
[23:18:28] <rpav> on android, Kiwi Browser is a good chrome fork with extension support
[23:18:49] <LordKalma> like I though the sponsored bar results were going to give me targeted adverts
[23:18:53] <LordKalma> not my URLs back
[23:18:54] <LordKalma> wtf
[23:19:18] <ville> why would you have any of that stuff turned on?
[23:19:28] <LordKalma> it's opt out
[23:19:40] <LordKalma> and I still hadn't done it
[23:19:47] <LordKalma> since the update
[23:21:02] <TheGuestMovie> LordKalma: was it you who linked a post about the difficulty of PS2 emulation over a month ago?
[23:21:12] <LordKalma> yes

[23:21:40] <rpav> is it still difficult these days?
[23:22:00] <TheGuestMovie> a) whats up with that forum? hilariously aggressive   b) why is it barely active?
[23:22:13] <rpav> i mean computationally, rather than "just" being a much more complicated architecture than like 6502 ;)
[23:22:15] <TheGuestMovie> how did you even find it
[23:22:18] <LordKalma> idk, I was just trying to find source for what I read before
[23:22:32] <LordKalma> I got the original info from "modern vintage gamer" iirc
[23:22:37] <LordKalma> a known emulator writter
[23:22:49] <LordKalma> apparently the floating point co-processor is some hard shit
[23:23:22] <rpav> it has some 3D stuff that doesn't really correlate well with modern GPUs i think too
[23:23:33] <LordKalma> or that
[23:23:51] <LordKalma> regardless, it was some tech that's kinda out there versus current architectures
[23:24:00] <rpav> well it seems pretty plausible that getting accurate floating point is both difficult and necessary
[23:24:24] <LordKalma> so it's hard to emulate a kflops processor even with a modern processor
[23:24:48] <rpav> yeah
[23:25:00] <rpav> hasn't more stuff since gone with the higher-level approach
[23:25:06] <rpav> like i have no idea how htey're doing ps3 emulation
[23:25:25] <LordKalma> no idea, not in the field
[23:26:18] <TheGuestMovie> even the Switch is emulated now
[23:26:28] <TheGuestMovie> it's crazy what's going on
[23:26:48] <LordKalma> well, arm is probably easier to emulate than old ass powerpc with custom co-processors
[23:27:09] <LordKalma> proof: roseta stone 2 in the M1 macs
[23:27:34] <hnOsmium0001> M1 has a dedicated x86 memory controller but sure
[23:27:37] <TheGuestMovie> you finish school yet, LK?
[23:27:46] <LordKalma> PhDing ;)
[23:27:49] <TheGuestMovie> oh no
[23:27:59] <LordKalma> yeah, oh no +1
[23:28:02] <imMute> oof. what's your thesis?
[23:28:18] <LordKalma> I research photonic processors of RF signals
[23:28:37] <TheGuestMovie> most people I know gave up on it. The few who didn't, are paid worse than if they had just gotten a developer job. To say nothing of the wasted 3 years.
[23:28:40] <imMute> ah, a black magic wizard.
[23:28:52] <LordKalma> I'm not a developer, I0m not in the US
[23:28:58] <LordKalma> and yes, my pay is absolute trash
[23:29:04] <LordKalma> hope to get done with it asap
[23:29:09] <TheGuestMovie> When I was a junior dev I was paid better than a co-worker with a PhD in physics who had worked at CERN, felt bad for him
[23:29:09] <rpav> like photon-based computation/cpu?
[23:29:09] <LordKalma> but Imma finish it
[23:29:21] <LordKalma> rpav, no, nothing like that
[23:29:41] <TheGuestMovie> then his wife left him

[23:45:18] <rpav> tangentially i had the most wonderfully terrible idea this week .. a markdown-based programming language .. sections are functions (with like [call](#function)), bulleted lists might be switch/conditionals, *variables*, tables for array literals
[23:45:47] <rpav> i was thinking `` for math expressions, but someone mentioned most of the time people use $$ and LaTeX math, and then i found Evaluatex which will evaluate them
[23:46:12] <LordKalma> PLEASE NO
[23:46:12] <rpav> maybe _types_

[23:47:44] <c4017w> I recently discovered `static inline` and have been moving some arrays from cpp files to within the class definition in the header file. I found that this increases code size though! Any ideas why?
[23:47:55] <rpav> not quite at a glance but yeah probably similar idea .. i was actually pretty surprised that i couldn't find any prior attempt at this (but maybe it's just today's shitty web searching)
[23:48:21] <rpav> c4017w: every .o you generate has to have the definition
[23:48:46] <rpav> i mean, every one that touches the header in question; LTO or equivalent should then reduce that, but
[23:49:04] <c4017w> rpav, I have -Os and lto enabled
[23:49:20] <rpav> -Os ime is pretty bad
[23:49:20] <c4017w> It's not like the data is being duplicated is it?
[23:49:28] <Raziel> >unironically using Os on anything but embedded
[23:49:29] <rpav> not sure
[23:49:34] <LordKalma> static inline makes sense even?
[23:49:36] <c4017w> this is embedded
[23:49:46] <rpav> LordKalma: in a class
[23:49:48] <Raziel> oh, well, oof.
[23:49:55] <LordKalma> rpav, do develop
[23:49:58] <rpav> ?
[23:50:25] <LordKalma> static class members are "class methods/data"
[23:50:29] <LordKalma> why static inline?
[23:50:41] <rpav> `struct X { const static inline vector<int> X = {....}; };` .. so no external definition
[23:50:45] <rpav> err, Y
[23:50:46] <rpav> but yeah
[23:50:56] <c4017w> yeah, just so I can move it to the header
[23:50:57] <Raziel> inline on a variable lets you do definition in a .h file
[23:50:58] <Raziel> that's it
[23:51:03] <LordKalma> anything inside a struct/class is already inlined
[23:51:06] <LordKalma> so I don't get it
[23:51:21] <LordKalma> or it isn't when it's static?
[23:51:32] <rpav> it's actually not, you'll get a redefinition error if it's not constexpr
[23:51:48] <rpav> it's like having a global variable defined in a .h
[23:52:09] <rpav> i mean, it _is_ having a global variable in a .h, it's just namespaced to the struct
[23:52:13] <LordKalma> so static counters the default inlinessness?
[23:52:23] <LordKalma> and you have to add it back?
[23:52:30] <c4017w> I guess I just shouldn't use static inline
[23:53:08] <rpav> LordKalma: well, there weren't really inline variables before 17
[23:53:42] <LordKalma> rpav, you can write the definition for anything inside a class in a header
[23:53:49] <LordKalma> it's inlined by default
[23:53:55] <rpav> c4017w: weird and crappy; maybe you need a different -flto option but i'd have to look at the asm
[23:54:43] <c4017w> rpav, project is too big and too optimized for me to see anything meaningful in the asm. Trying to make a smaller example
[23:55:19] <rpav> {} struct S { static int X = 42; };

[23:55:28] <rpav> {} struct S { static inline int X = 42; };
[23:55:28] <geordi>  
[23:55:32] <c4017w> are there options for LTO in GCC? I thought it was just -flto and that's it
[23:55:44] <LordKalma> c4017w, there's thinLTO
[23:55:47] <rpav> not sure i guess, maybe i'm thinking of clang
