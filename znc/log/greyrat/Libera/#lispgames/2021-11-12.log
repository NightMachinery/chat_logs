[04:00:51] <Ty_> Finally...IRC noob so it took me like an hour to get in here xD
[04:03:32] <technomancy> you made it
[04:06:48] <Ty_> What lisp dialect and engine/library/etc. would be a good place to start? I've got a decent amount of experience making games, but basically no experience with lisp. I've done a bit of clojurescript.
[04:07:27] <technomancy> ask ten lispers, get ten answers =)
[04:08:06] <technomancy> there have been plenty of clojure entries to the lisp game jam tho; you could look at those? I think the most recent one was won by a game made with ArcadiaGodot?
[04:08:44] <Ty_> Interesting! I've used godot a fair bit, might be worth looking into. Last I heard of Arcadia it was a Unity thing
[04:08:45] <technomancy> haven't used it myself but selfsame seemed to like it https://github.com/arcadia-unity/ArcadiaGodot
[04:09:25] <technomancy> starting from zero the easiest to learn is definitely TIC-80, but it has some pretty severe limitations that you might not like: https://tic80.com
[04:09:52] <technomancy> guess it depends on whether you already have a specific game idea in mind or not
[04:10:10] <Ty_> Dozens, of course
[04:10:21] <technomancy> hehe
[04:14:14] <technomancy> well if you use TIC-80 there are some other folks in here besides me who can help you with that if you have questions. if you use ArcadiaGodot I think it's just selfsame; you might be better off with that in the #clojure channel?
[04:17:30] <Ty_> Has anyone experimented with Fennel/Lovr?
[04:17:43] <technomancy> haha, again I think only selfsame =)
[04:17:55] <dto> Ty_: a user named Mattykins is sometimes here and uses Fennel
[04:17:56] <technomancy> lovr needs a newer opengl than my graphics card supports =(
[04:18:43] <technomancy> looks real neat tho. I've heard good things.
[04:19:10] <technomancy> dto: also I'm the lead developer on Fennel. =)
[04:19:43] <dto> Oh yeah!
[04:32:48] <Ty_> Oh snap!
[04:34:06] <Ty_> Keep in mind I'm super new to lisp, so I'm a bit worried that the answer here is "that's obviously not applicable." I was wondering the other day if Fennel would benefit at all from pairing with Luau, the roblox Lua-ish typescript thing that was recently announced.
[04:35:37] <technomancy> Ty_: the short version is I don't think it's a great fit; Luau is 100% focused on running sandboxed code and not even trying to be a general-purpose language, but Lua is already great at that without any extensions. other efforts to add a type system exist and are likely to be more fruitful to explore.
[04:35:47] <technomancy> plus the Luau people removed TCO so it's hard to take them that seriously
[04:36:24] <technomancy> if you want to talk more about that we should take it to #fennel which is more on-topic

[06:25:36] <mfiano> Congrats on the new game too
