[00:00:09] <DPA> The "keys" of an array aren't real.  Noone stores them. It's just item address - first item address.
[00:00:31] <ski> yea, each object would be stored as some sequence of bits (typically the number being divisible by number of bits in a "word")
[00:00:40] <absentia> you hash the keys into an actual address or offset

[00:01:21] <absentia> functional programming is pure brain damage
[00:01:50] <pyzozord> it's just math, that's it
[00:01:50] <ski> finite maps tend to support adding new key-value associations. so `Array' won't be a subtype of `Map' (Liskov Substitution Principle)

[00:03:13] <ski> ProfSimm : i wasn't necessarily assuming mutability
[00:03:23] <epony> your calculator, does it operate with digits stored in registers which are bits combined in a digit representation, or "maps" and "tuples"?
[00:03:34] <ProfSimm> ski: to me adding/removing keys on a map is mutability no
[00:03:40] <ProfSimm> I think it's fascinating realization that arrays are in fact more like dictionaries.
[00:03:46] <ski> pyzozord : programming is more like "applied logic", in one sense
[00:04:01] <epony> hay, eehm, let me map you the digit 5 in this list of conses.. what?

[00:05:59] <flakland> did you find an article on encyclopedia britannica about it?
[00:06:00] <DPA> To me, math is algebra. It is a set of definitions, equation, constraints, that form a complicated structure, encapsulating all implications on any assumption (=new constriants) that are possible if applied. At the same time, it's often too big a structure to be able to find the result one is interested in.
[00:06:00] <epony> the a- experssions are your creation, obviously
[00:06:14] <ski> pyzozord : only part of programming is numerically intensive. unless you're going for graphics, audio, or other numeric-intensive processing (like scientific or statistical), discrete math (equational reasoning, logic, set theory, type theory, graph theory, combinatorics, ...) tend to be more relevant

[03:48:18] <sonny> so, it should be fine to use a form to create a password right? since https

[08:15:47] *** Quits: duuude (~user@user/duuude) (Remote host closed the connection)
[08:16:01] <nitrix> Very little to do with currying. Proper currying is the ability for functions with large arity to be represented as if they took a single argument, but that argument being a tuple.
[08:16:02] <sonny> add will have a signature like a -> a -> a
[08:16:09] <ski>   function :: ArgumentType0 -> ArgumentType1 -> ... -> ResultType  -- curried style
[08:16:13] <sonny> which looks alien to me
[08:16:13] *** Joins: duuude (~user@user/duuude)
[08:16:22] <ski>   function :: (ArgumentType0,ArgumentType1,...) -> ResultType  -- tupled style
[08:16:42] <nitrix> So you can transform functions from/to their curried form by packing/unpacking multiple arguments into a single tuple. Nothing too impressive about it.
[08:17:11] <sonny> ski all functions in this language follow the first form?
[08:17:16] <sonny> s/this/these/
[08:17:16] <ski> no
[08:17:26] <nitrix> I think what you're more interested in is how functions can be partially applied.
[08:17:28] <ski> "curried style" vs. "tupled style" is in your mind, not in the language
[08:17:37] <ski> in the language, all functions take exactly one argument
[08:17:43] <sonny> what do you mean, see the signature
[08:18:31] <ski> you can use both styles above, in both languages mentioned. you can even mix the two styles
[08:18:46] <ski>   foo :: A -> (B,C) -> D -> E
[08:18:58] <ski> there's a trade-off between them
[08:19:04] <nitrix> sonny, A function `foo :: a -> a -> a` can be understood as either, a function that takes two arguments and produces a result, or more creatively (and this is the crucial to functional programming), it can also be understood as a function taking one argument, returning a function that takes an argument and produces a result.
[08:19:33] <nitrix> sonny, That is to say, it parses like: foo :: a -> (a -> a)
[08:19:59] <ski> curried style enables (an easy way to) partially apply functions. because of this, usually people will place arguments "which tend to vary less often" earlier, in the sequence of arguments
[08:20:42] <ski> (partial application simply means to provide some of the multiple parameters of a function, getting back a function that awaits the remaining ones, before calling the original function)
[08:21:01] <ski> consider
[08:21:09] <nitrix> For example, see the type reductions of a function like (+), which I've intentionally made monomorphic with Int to simplify things:
[08:21:15] <ski>   map :: (a -> b) -> ([a] -> [b])
[08:21:31] <ski> because this is expressed in curried style, you can't just say
[08:22:03] <nitrix> (+) :: Int -> Int -> Int
[08:22:09] <nitrix> (+ 1) :: Int -> Int
[08:22:15] <nitrix> (+ 1 1) :: Int
[08:22:19] <ski>   map (\xs -> map (^ 2) xs) [[],[0],[1,2],[3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]]  -- which computes `[[],[0],[1,4],[9,16,35],[36,49,64,81]]'
[08:22:35] <ski> but you can abbreviate this as
[08:22:42] <ski>   map (map (^ 2)) [[],[0],[1,2],[3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]]
[08:22:46] <ski> if it had been

[08:22:54] <ski>   map :: (a -> b,[a]) -> [b]
[08:22:59] <ski> then you couldn't do this as nicely
[08:24:07] <ski> (yet another way to write that is `(map . map) (^ 2) [[],[0],[1,2],[3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]]' which can be read as "two list levels deep, square all elements in the list of lists")
[08:24:23] <FloridaMan> Jesus, I thought I was nerdy and then I opened this channel
[08:24:52] <ski> programmers being nerdy, what's new ? :)
[08:25:00] <sonny> nitrix what does (+ 1) do?
[08:25:07] <sonny> s/do/return/
[08:25:15] <ski> (nitrix meant to say `(+) 1' and `(+) 1 1', btw)
[08:25:27] <ski> sonny : `(+) 1' is the "add one" function
[08:25:31] <nitrix> sonny, It partially applies the first argument, the 1, then produces a function that's ready to accept the second argument to finally give you a result.
[08:25:52] <nitrix> sonny, So the result and type of (+ 1) would be that of a function.
[08:25:57] <ski> (`(+) x y' is prefix application notation for `x + y'. this works with all infix operators (including user-defined ones))

[08:30:13] <ski> sonny : the syntax of Haskell (and SML and OCaml, F#, Clean) does have some features that encourage using curried style (a little bit less syntactic clutter). but the languages themselves allow both styles. the styles are two different ways in which you can map "multiple parameters" (which, strictly speaking, doesn't exist in those languages) into "single-parameter only".

[08:33:18] <ski> (in SML, more functions in the standard library are in tupled style, because the implementation would try to unpack the components of those tuples into multiple parameters (perhaps registers or stack slots), but not do that for curried style. in OCaml, the reverse)

[08:34:14] <nitrix> sonny, You could write `map (\e -> e + 1) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` to apply an anonymous function, but it reads a little silly. We shouldn't have to create an anonymous function just for that, we already have a perfectly fine (+) function, why wrap it by a lambda.
[08:34:50] <nitrix> sonny, So the idea here is to partially apply the addition function (+) to 1, creating a function that adds one. When it's done with an operator we call it a section.
[08:35:02] <ski> (another way to consider `(1 /)' is that it computes the function `f', defined by `f d = 1 / d', while `(/ 1)' computes the function `g', defined by `g n = n / 1'. so `(1 +)' is the "add one to" function, while `(+ 1)' is the "add to one" function. of course, since addition is commutative, these two functions behave the same (are equal))
[08:35:23] <nitrix> sonny, So (+1) is now a partially applied function, specifically an operator section. That function will add 1.
[08:35:25] <sonny> nitrix ah good point, so you think it was motivated by map?
[08:35:29] <nitrix> Oh no.
[08:35:49] <ski> `map' is just another example of a function that (usefully) employs curried style
[08:35:55] <nitrix> It's motivated by having higher-order functions. Functions that accepts other functions.

[08:37:52] <sonny> interesting
[08:37:58] <sonny> ok, this is pretty cool
[08:38:12] <nitrix> Unfortunately it reads backwards. The `g` is applied on the argument, producing an intermediary result, then that intermediary result is fed to `f`, producing the final result.
[08:38:21] <sonny> this is what happens when you are interested in using functions as the main abstraction
[08:38:33] <nitrix> The & operator reads in a more natural left-to-right order.

[08:39:08] <sonny> is composition a combinator?
[08:39:50] <nitrix> turtle & move 5 & draw 10 & turn right & draw 5, etc. Assuming those functions all have some kind of turtle parameter that they take as last argument and return.
[08:39:51] <ski> this is somewhat related to "wholemeal programming" (focusing on collections of elements, how to transform collection to collection) rather than "piecemeal programming" (focusing on individual elements)

[08:42:14] <ski> sonny : a combinator is simply an operation (or expression) which doesn't have any free variables. combinator libraries typically express some eDSL, with library operations for combining relevant library phrases (of the DSL) into larger such
[08:42:23] <ski> (and yes, composition is a combinator)
[08:42:32] <sonny> ok, great
[08:42:35] <nitrix> sonny, Combinators are little helper functions (usually given names with symbols so they can act like infix operators) and they tend to combine functions with different arities in different ways.
[08:42:57] <nitrix> For example, (.:) could be a composition like earlier of a function of 1 argument with a function of 2 arguments.
[08:43:24] <nitrix> It's still with the idea of preserving that pipeline idea ski mentioned.

[09:07:11] <nitrix> ski, Like I understand the theory, it's your world token, just like in Haskell, but Haskell goes insane lengths to try to make the mechanics implicit so that you don't have to deal with it, and at the end of the day, it's just an indicator for the purity, forcing I/O things to clump up together in the call tree and the pure things can form leaves.

[14:36:19] <mrig> well a lot of the growth really comes from sunlight which rather magically uses the carbon whilst doing its thing.

[14:42:58] <mrig> Some seem to lack the senses to detect these kinds of obvious issues, I mean with the application of just a little common sense it is obvious that you cant get perpetual motion from chemistry either, and growth and nutrients obviously comes under that umbrella.
[14:43:47] <mrig> differing health issues to a future generation seem to be big buisness.
[14:44:07] <GeDaMo> Basically plants work together with fungi in the soil
[14:44:14] <GeDaMo> Can't really do that in hydroponics

[14:56:46] <Decker> ahh - don't :) sql factories suck
[14:57:00] <mrig> so I put in a struct or an array of structs and a mode, it compiles a statement from that.
[14:57:06] <Decker> not factories what's that word?
[14:57:31] <Decker> generates odbc bindings back to data structure members and all? :)
[14:57:38] <mrig> Oh right, what do you recommend, just write the SQL for each use case?
[14:57:46] <Decker> so the result gets translated directly to the structures isntead of having to copy them yousefl
[14:58:08] <Decker> mrig ya, often the list of canned queries you do is pretty limited
[14:58:37] <mrig> This is not object related mapping though, just for dealing with structs and composed data.
[14:58:59] <Decker> other things like reporting packages after the fact (if any) will have their own libraries - though if you can share information on how things relate with views, it can simplify their work ( and views are a pretty defacto standard feature of SQL databases these days)
[14:59:00] <mrig> and then the rest manually was my thought.

[15:01:21] <Decker> no :)

[15:57:00] <mrig> Though it is interesting that he has avoided C++ for so long, I think that this is because using it would have broken many of his techniques very early on.
[15:57:30] <davros> i used to code the way he's advocating.. like 20 years ago
[15:57:53] <mrig> davros: I would think that it is the compile times that he dislikes, but I am speculating there though.
[15:57:55] <bnchs__> i also find a problem with how rust abstracts memory away from the programmer
[15:58:07] <amigojapan> easyme:; multiple page applications require loading time between one page and another, so it is a little ugly for some people, that being said, security should never be left up to the client, and making server  side only applications wouold mean using multiple page applications again

[15:58:49] <amigojapan> easyme: if you really want to lock something down, make it server side
[15:58:53] <bnchs__> amigojapan: unlike SPA, the web browser has a HTML cache
[15:59:06] <bnchs__> that stores the html pages for an amount of time set by the server
[15:59:09] <mrig> davros: sure thing, there is no language that suits every coding type.
[15:59:17] <amigojapan> bnchs__: which does not matter when it is the firts time you access it
[15:59:18] <davros> yeah thats fair
[15:59:30] <bnchs__> to save on network bandwidth. with SPA, they use websockets and shit
[15:59:31] <davros> now he says "rust is just another c++" .. but
[15:59:41] <bnchs__> which means the browser cant optimize it with caches
[15:59:53] <davros> c++ might offend you for what it's trying to do, or the fact that it's half broken, it's a messy attempt
[15:59:54] <mrig> It does appear to be very similar to c++
[16:00:06] <davros> rust is to me a much cleaner implementation of what modern C++ is trying to be
[16:00:16] <mrig> Will appeal to the same coding mind set, I mean.
[16:00:28] <davros> you might have looked at modern C++ from C, and thought "yuk"

[16:00:48] <bnchs__> i hated templates in C++

[16:01:49] <bnchs__> yes
[16:01:54] <mrig> memory arenas seem to be a goto solution for that.
[16:02:06] <mrig> memory mandalas :)
[16:02:12] <davros> not a general solution though
[16:02:23] <mrig> sure usecase dependant.
[16:02:41] <davros> whats great about C++ or rust for gamedev is you can have a sliding scale between your high level and low level code
[16:03:13] <davros> there's a case for writing an engine in C, and doing tools in "something GC'd because they dont matter" but then you have friction being unable to migrate code from one place to the other
[16:03:34] <mrig> And would it compile fast for dynamic updating whilst debugging?
[16:03:37] <davros> i'm well aware that doing lots of dynamic mmeory in tight loops would be silly, and i've shipped things using *no* dynamic alloc
[16:03:43] <mrig> with the thing running?
[16:03:48] <davros> pure memory arenas.. thing is today, thats overkill
[16:05:09] <davros> and multithreading is really important, rust has all the constraints for that to be sane

[16:05:43] <GeDaMo> Tagged unions are great
[16:05:51] <davros> yeah i've been really surprised
[16:06:37] <davros> of course C can do them manully but when they're a slick language feature, they become more of how you think about a problem
[16:07:00] <GeDaMo> They also remove a lot of the need for raw pointers
[16:07:02] <davros> C++ herd you toward doing everything with classes (with its syntax) , and then you have to take a step back where they mess up
[16:07:16] <davros> rust herds you toward tagged union use with enum/match, and... its awesome

[16:13:55] <piou> easyme: client-side is under the client's control, and when talking security you should consider that this client is an attacker trying to bypass your security. If you make the security check on the client's side, that's like asking the attacker to please lock himself out, it cannot work. Only a trusted server can perform the security check. Another way to see it is that it's the difference

[17:57:01] <nomagno> vdamewood: "nothing to hide" is indeed a logical fallacy, because morality and hence law is subjective

[18:00:54] <ProfSimm> vdamewood: they need lists like anything else. You can call them vectors. 0D = scalar, 1D = vector, 2D = matrix, arbitrary D = tensor

[18:22:37] <FloridaMan> Wh0: so you've now fetched, which means your machine is aware of the changes done remotely cut hasn't done anything with them at this point. You need to checkout the branch that the changes were made on remotely

[18:31:48] <Wh0> ok got it
[18:31:57] <vdamewood> InPhase FloridaMan: For example, it will start out by showing what happens when you have no version control and you edit somethign and can't remember how to change it back. So you start by tar'ing your code every once in a while and how that gets tedious, so you use git and it's commits to replace tarballs, and moves on from that.
[18:32:07] <deniska> there's this config option which makes git display much saner merge diffs…
[18:32:26] <deniska> `conflictStyle = diff3` or whatever
[18:33:47] <vdamewood> Then, you want to make changes to your code in an experiment, but you don't want to fully commit to using those changes in your 'main' codebase, so you copy things over and make your changes. Once you like your changes, you copy the new changes over and it's great. But... what if you made changes in both copies, then what? How would you manage combining the changes? git branch and git merge to the rescue.

[18:45:25] <InPhase> Wh0: The answer comes down to "it depends on what you are doing".  There are a set of tradeoffs with all the git branching choices.  Branches aren't really even needed for very simply commits if the developer count is not high.  Short-lived branches tend to be best to avoid code divergence and to preserve always-working, but some changes are too big and interdependent to fit into short-lived 
[18:45:31] <InPhase> branches, and you have to pay the prices of the long-lived branches to make that progress.

[18:47:20] <FloridaMan> If you're used to the "file goes on the server" way of looking at things, git requires a paradigm shift to understand properly

[18:48:18] <vdamewood> I remember once having to deal with someone who just wanted to upload code to github without using git, as if github was an FTP server for their developer portfolio.
[18:49:38] <InPhase> Wh0: And, because git branching and merging is primarily about multi-developer coordination, when to branch, how much to branch, and when to merge, is also a team coordination decision that should be worked out with coding standards agreement and open team communication.  Like for example when you get closer to releasing something, branches should probably get smaller.
[18:49:53] <FloridaMan> If you come to git from something like svn as I did then I think it's even harder to grasp the local and remote repo concepts than it would be without knowing any type of VCS at all

[18:54:25] <apotheon> . . . whereas Git was more explicitly an attempt to reimplement the parts of BitKeeper that the Linux project used.
[18:54:26] <upp> i remember "-bk" kernel versions when it was bitkeeper
[18:54:57] <vdamewood> amigojapan: The Karthavan Trail.
[18:55:04] <FloridaMan> Occasionally there's a "wheel reinvention", but most of the time it's just iterative progress (as it should be).
[18:55:24] <apotheon> Git is an example of the way that every program either gets replaced or reimplemented, over and over, at least until it's available in the most permissively licensed way possible.
[18:55:27] <amigojapan> vdamewood: what is Karthavan? like caravan?
[18:55:42] <vdamewood> git really was "Oh shit. We can't use bitkeeper anymore. Gotta write something else, now"
[18:55:54] <vdamewood> amigojapan: It's a name I made up for a fantasy world.
[18:56:07] <amigojapan> ah thanks vdamewood
[18:56:19] <apotheon> Yeah, BitKeeper being yanked out from under Linux is the whole reason Linus bothered to create Git.
[18:56:27] <FloridaMan> git is also more than just a "program"
[18:56:34] <vdamewood> amigojapan: Karthavan could be the name of a land people are migrating to. And on the way they face orc war parties, and have to hunt unicorns for food.
[18:56:45] <amigojapan> vdamewood: I am not sure I want to keep a single trail tho, maybe making it possible to freely move around the world could be more fun
[18:56:47] <apotheon> Yeah, it's a tightly integrated hairball of programs.
[18:56:56] <FloridaMan> apotheon: indeed
[18:57:09] <vdamewood> amigojapan: Or make it like the real life trail which forked and went to both California and Oregon.

[18:57:31] <apotheon> People who say it conforms to the Unix philosophy don't seem to understand the hairball aspect.
[18:57:49] <vdamewood> amigojapan: So, people can go either to Karthavan, or Nal'Urdesh to the south.
[18:57:50] <amigojapan> vdamewood: yeah, maybe a quest, looking for the holy grail  or osmething liek that, where you need to move freely thru the world

[20:21:30] <norias> wait. 
[20:21:31] <amigojapan> は　is only used as wa in hiragana for the particle that points to the partical marker
[20:21:46] <norias> I had no idea my irc client could display japanese 
[20:22:17] <amigojapan> norias: if  yo are using UTF-8 and have a font that supports Japanese t hen you can
[20:22:36] <norias> amigojapan: apparently those things are true in this case
[20:22:40] <amigojapan> norias: and many other languages by the way
[20:23:05] <norias> neat
[20:23:08] <norias> hmmm
[20:23:45] <apotheon> amigojapan: Yeah, I'm pretty familiar with that usage of は, but wasn't sure whether it was ever used anywhere else with a "wa" pronunciation.
[20:23:46] <amigojapan> norias: is you went in the IRCchat that used to be 2ch irc, you could not see Japanese cause they use the shift jis encoding

[20:25:47] <amigojapan> yup

[20:26:32] <amigojapan> but nto any more
[20:26:35] <norias> oh, fun
[20:26:48] <apotheon> norias: That would be quite odd in Japanese.
[20:26:56] <norias> apotheon: no doubt
[20:27:28] <apotheon> It turns out that writing Japanese vertically is more difficult in IRC than Arabic right to left.
[20:27:45] <amigojapan> apotheon: current Japanese is already a simplification of old Japanese, I guess this is ovious
[20:27:51] <apotheon> yep
[20:27:56] <norias> apotheon: i may have to play with it
[20:28:09] <norias> it's been a while since i messed with arabic
[20:28:30] <apotheon> I'm kinda glad I grew up with English, because I'm a right-handed fountain pen user, and something like Hebrew or Arabic would make things more difficult.
[20:28:37] <amigojapan> apotheon: I think the irc cient would need ot support it that way
[20:29:03] <bnchs___> do you treat computers like they're special
[20:29:05] <norias> apotheon: arabic is a fun and beautiful language, though
[20:29:13] <norias> bnchs___: buy them flowers
[20:29:15] <amigojapan> apotheon: there is a Japanese language programming language called Nadeshiko, which is written in vertical form in their editor
[20:29:18] <apotheon> amigojapan: It would require some weird UI stuff to make vertical writing work well in combination with horizontal writing.
[20:29:51] <apotheon> hmm
[20:30:01] <norias> bnchs___: oops, i thought you ask "How do you ..."
[20:30:11] <CodePoint> fuck the world
[20:30:12] <apotheon> Nadeshiko seems . . . like an interesting language, just based on that.

[20:39:52] <apotheon> inhahe_: What if someone replies in vertical Japanese to someone writing in horizontal English, though?  Now your text is in separate windows/panes, and there's no longer a meaningful linearality between the two languages.
[20:39:56] *** solidfox is now known as snake2
[20:40:15] <amigojapan> but to be honest horizontal is fine for Japanese too, and it is what is most used for texting, vertical is more used for word processing
[20:40:33] <apotheon> The fact that Japanese people are perfectly fine with writing horizontally left-to-right makes things much easier.
[20:40:44] *** snake2 is now known as snake[creamy]
[20:40:56] <inhahe_> apotheon: true, you could timestamp all the messages but that's still hard to make sense of

[23:26:13] <FloridaMan> We should name it 
[23:26:15] <oldlaptop> (Imagine for example a frob(thing) that could take any one of a dozen options to fine-tune its behavior.)
[23:26:20] <flakland> oldlaptop perhaps it's over-using default parameters

[23:31:35] <flakland> defaults! yes
[23:31:36] <FloridaMan> And not having to remember what order they go in
[23:31:39] <flakland> we have agreement on that one
[23:31:53] <oldlaptop> It's not that there's some inherent benefit to reordering them, necessarily, so much that humans are going to have a hard time remembering the order, and which things correspond to which positions.
