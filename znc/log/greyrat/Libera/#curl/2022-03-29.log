[00:25:00] <plujon> Does libcurl have an option for timing out a slow DNS lookup?
[00:26:55] <plujon> I've tried CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_TIME, and CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT, but none of them seem to affect the DNS lookup.  I know of CURL_TIMEOUT, but that is for the entire transfer, if I'm not mistaken...

[01:20:41] <bagder> I can't get to my mac to check right now, but I figure it uses the threaded resolver so the timeout should indeed work, and CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, as well

[17:55:35] <milkylainen> bagder: Yup. But hosting two releases with the same name, different tarballs, different hashes is confusing. I see a lot of projects doing that. I dunno if it's the github variant of packaging a release that doesn't prepare it as a release in the classical autoconf sense.
[17:55:41] *** Joins: sayan (~sayan@dgplug/sayan)
[17:56:13] <gevaerts> As I understand things it's github doing that by itself unless you manage to find the exact hoops to jump through to make it not do that
[17:57:53] <milkylainen> gevaerts: Probably. Github is probably generic in that sense. Just packaging. Still causes confusion though. :)
[17:58:35] <nimaje> one is probably the release tarball and the other a tarball of the sources at the release tag (afaik gh automatically provides source tarballs for tags)
[17:59:33] <milkylainen> Yes. I am merely commenting the fact that confusion arises from different releases named the same thing but hashes not matching.
[17:59:55] <milkylainen> Sometimes they're stored in "releases" in github.
[17:59:59] <milkylainen> Not just tags.
[18:03:16] <milkylainen> Makes it far easier to sneak in bad sourceballs. :)  "Oh the hash doesn't match. Prolly just some autoconf stuff... Let's go ahead..."
[18:05:57] <nimaje> pretty sure each release on github needs a corresponding tag and will always have a source tarball and if you want deterministic release tarballs or add other stuff you have to upload one (github sometimes rerolls source tarball)

[18:24:19] <bagder> nope
[18:24:51] <bagder> that's actually the main reason I put the tarballs there, as otherwise so many download those generated ones and get surprised they're not the same as the "real" releases
[18:26:37] <nimaje> well, it probably would be enough to disable those 'Source code' links
[18:27:16] <milkylainen> Hmm. It is a very common confusion yes. Esp. since people are shifting from "old" release storage to github. iirc there are autotools/autoconf projects storing the tarballs under releases but they still don't contain a prepped environment.
