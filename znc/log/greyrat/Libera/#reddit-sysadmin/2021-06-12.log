[00:02:04] <gibby> ++++++++++for the Aeron 
[00:02:24] <Alternity> please dont buy some likely chinese junk made by some hairbrained person
[00:02:26] <gibby> got one at the onset of 2020, easily the best decision I've made
[00:02:32] <Alternity> i honestly thought it was a spoof video
[00:03:08] <sd_> 05<v​yz> gibby: is it worth the price tag
[00:03:12] <sd_> 05<v​yz> i've only heard amazing things
[00:03:18] <gibby> 100% yes
[00:03:29] <gibby> buy used/referb
[00:03:34] <Alternity> they 'retail' for over a thousand but you can very easily find it cheaper
[00:03:35] <sd_> 05<v​yz> they have a partnership with logitech and made a "gaming" one for an extra like 700$
[00:03:37] <Alternity> i paid $320 new
[00:03:41] <sd_> 05<v​yz> w
[00:03:44] <sd_> 05<v​yz> the fuck?

[00:04:07] <sd_> 05<v​yz> maybe i gotta look a little harder damn
[00:04:50] <oxipital> im reading the wikipedia article for the aeron
[00:05:00] <oxipital> there's a sitting expert.
[00:05:29] <killdash9> I <3 my Aeron. Had it like 12 years and going strong
[00:05:51] <sintax> I want a gaming chair to adjust to my body. 
[00:05:58] <killdash9> totally worth the $$$. You'll buy 3-4 'gaming' chairs in that time
[00:06:18] <AnonymooseReddtr> $1200 though
[00:06:19] <AnonymooseReddtr> but yea
[00:06:21] <AnonymooseReddtr> thats true
[00:06:22] <sintax> really?
[00:06:24] <sintax> hmm
[00:06:32] <sintax> gonna have to look in to it
[00:06:35] <killdash9> find one used. That's where I got mine for about $500
[00:06:38] <oxipital> i want the comfort of a recliner
[00:06:44] <sd_> 05<v​yz> yeah a herman miller can provide
[00:06:49] <oxipital> with office char manuverability
[00:06:52] <sd_> 05<v​yz> maybe not that soft leather but will def be comft
[00:07:08] <sintax> a zero gravity desk like the scorpion at around $2000 would be cool
[00:07:15] <sintax> be floating and working
[00:07:59] <AnonymooseReddtr> erm
[00:08:03] <AnonymooseReddtr> autonomous ergochair?
[00:08:09] <AnonymooseReddtr> it reclines? wtf
[00:08:30] <oxipital> apparently they added lumbar support because people "to conform to public expectations—"because that's what people think is required for it to be a scientifically 'good' chair""
[00:08:46] <sintax> heh
[00:09:00] <oxipital> i want the cushion of the recliner and leg support when i recine
[00:09:19] <sd_> 05<v​yz> some brand out there must take the good features of a recliner and turn it into an office chair
[00:09:40] <oxipital> just lie a lazyboy on casters 
[00:10:18] <sd_> 05<v​yz> this guy made universal wheels for office chairs and for $40 i turned my chair into a roller skate

[00:10:30] <Alternity> here is where i got my aeron https://www.madisonseating.com/aeron-chair-by-herman-miller-loaded-lumbar-carbon.html
[00:10:45] <Alternity> but there are several discount chair websites around
[00:11:07] <killdash9> if you go with Aeron. Get the 'C' model
[00:11:11] <sd_> 04<R​ootbear75> IDK how i feel about this computer.  I'm checking benchmarks versus what I have now... annnnd i don't see an improvement. I currently have a 1080
[00:11:48] <killdash9> I have a 'B' because it's what my work gave me back then. At my old office I had a 'C' and it was so much nicer to have the wider base

[00:36:58] <Cl0udNinja> 90% of the time I'm sitting with one leg crossed under while the other dangles over, and if thats not happening I'm basically squatted forward resting my arms on my knees
[00:37:12] <oxipital> im coming to realize my body is a bigger wreck than i thought
[00:37:19] <sintax> oxipital: you building one? 
[00:37:20] <Cl0udNinja> welcome to getting older
[00:37:37] <oxipital> sintax, nah. i'd like to
[00:37:57] <sintax> It's not hard. I've built a couple. 
[00:38:04] <oxipital> really dont have a work area
[00:38:09] <sintax> Always ended up selling them for more than i had in them. 
[00:38:16] <oxipital> my brother would freak f he found out i was building one
[00:38:30] <sintax> but i've got one now. and a 300 blackout on an AR frame with a 10" barrel. It's considered a 'pistol'
[00:38:37] <oxipital> arent actual parts hard to find?
[00:38:40] <sintax> let him freak haha
[00:38:54] <sintax> my favorite is my flintlock .32 caliber. 
[00:39:25] <sintax> oxipital: parts no. You can buy kits right now. you only need an FFL dealer to purchase the lower as it is what was picked for the NICS background check. 
[00:39:34] <sintax> So you could buy everything but a lower now. 
[00:39:41] <oxipital> i really woouldnt mind a little .22 pitol
[00:39:52] <sintax> Then find a lower and an FFL dealer to do the transfer unless you buy a lower from a store. 
[00:40:27] <sintax> the 300 blackout is a .30 caliber. with a suppressor and sub sonic rounds it's as close as you can get to movie quiet

[00:41:31] <oxipital> ive seen a 3d printed suppressor i want to print
[00:41:43] <oxipital> no idea if i could print one for my gun
[00:41:51] <killdash9> I've 3D printed an AR lower and shot it with my .22lr upper
[00:41:51] <sintax> nice. the atf looks down on that. they miss their $200 tax
[00:42:04] <sintax> sweet killdash9 
[00:42:11] <oxipital> well so long as i dont advertise
[00:42:13] <killdash9> um, you are still required to pay the tax on all home built suppressors
[00:42:28] <sintax> and the background check they do?
[00:42:30] <killdash9> or don't get caught with one
[00:42:31] <sintax> i think they do one?
[00:42:38] <killdash9> yep. all of that is required
[00:42:56] <sintax> thought so

[00:43:13] <sintax> yes

[00:43:17] <killdash9> to print a lower like I did, it is not required to tell anyone. Huurrrr GHOST GUN!

[00:44:03] <killdash9> Form 4 approvals are taking near a year or something.
[00:44:10] <killdash9> which can?
[00:44:17] <sintax> I just don't want to wait 8 months. I can ccw and walk in show that and get a gun, but not a suppressor. it's dumb

[04:15:47] <BWMerlin> Terrible idea or not?  Re-image all the Mac's at work to Windows.  The plan is to buy (in phases each year) Windows devices as they (IMO) better suited for education environment so I can either wait out the Mac's for their refresh cycle or transition them Mac users onto Windows on their Mac

[04:25:20] <enix> Very bad idea. Windows/Bootcamp is fine, but supporting it in that way will be a giant headache, beyond what you're expecting
[04:25:29] <xe0n> windows on mac is dead.
[04:25:33] <enix> It's the unexpected, illogical weirdities that make you cry
[04:25:39] <xe0n> sure, parrallels, but yeah, its a dead end
[04:25:57] <xe0n> Macs can be managed - look at MDM solutions - jamf etc
[04:26:01] <xe0n> The OS aint the issue lol

[04:27:13] <enix> nah jk ceebs
[04:27:25] <enix> Yeah it's a dead idea really
[04:27:28] <Riviera> there are so many mdms
[04:27:28] <xe0n> boot camp is dead.
[04:27:31] <xe0n> yep
[04:27:32] <enix> Which is kinda ironic lol
[04:27:39] <enix> With Windows becoming more linuxy by the day
[04:27:51] <Riviera> anything better than jamf for macs?

[04:52:42] *** Quits: hakoDA (~hakoDA@user/hakoda) (Quit: 0xDEADBEEF)
[04:52:44] <BWMerlin> Plan is to bring in cheaper and better supported Windows device but that will lead to a transition time of about three years
[04:53:04] <BWMerlin> So I could speed up the transition time and get everyone on the same page by loading Windows onto the Mac's
[04:53:12] <xe0n> nope
[04:53:19] <xe0n> the OS doesn't matter...
[04:53:25] <BWMerlin> Currently teaching staff have a Mac and run Windows on it
[04:54:18] <xe0n> hardware is one thing, licensing costs are another
[04:54:19] *** Joins: eddiejennings (~eddiejenn@136.55.133.232)
[04:54:19] <BWMerlin> That issue isn't Mac is worse and Windows is better it is that staff run Windows and students run Mac and that causes issues in the classroom
[04:54:28] <xe0n> no shit
[04:54:32] <BWMerlin> So getting them onto the same OS is the real goal
[04:54:43] <BWMerlin> It just happens that Windows devices are cheaper and have better support
[04:56:22] <xe0n> macs have plenty support, you know education sector is one of their big markets, right?
[04:56:28] <xe0n> schools have had macs for _years_
[04:56:33] <xe0n> going back...30 years
[04:57:03] <BWMerlin> Oh I remember having Mac's when I was a kit
[04:57:36] <BWMerlin> But ACE isn't great (2% fleet replacement) and AppleCare+ is $150 min with $450 cap for ADP
[04:57:42] <BWMerlin> The devices also cost more
[04:58:13] <xe0n> then look at another solution to manage them? there's plenty out there
[04:58:34] <BWMerlin> I can get an i5, 16GB RAM and 256GB SSD Lenovo L13 with 3 years warranty and $0 ADP for LESS than an M1 Macbook Air with AppleCare+
[04:58:45] <xe0n> yeah dude... we know pcs are cheaper than macs
[04:58:49] <xe0n> lol
[04:59:26] <xe0n> you're aware of the licensing costs involved when you do this stuff as well? need to take that stuff into account
[04:59:34] <BWMerlin> I work in Beenleigh, I can save the school 90 GRAND A YEAR!!! by going Windows
[04:59:37] <xe0n> lots of moving parts, it'll be costly :P
[04:59:51] <BWMerlin> Licensing is not an issue for us, that is all FREEEEEEEE
[05:00:03] <xe0n> no...that's 90 grand on hardware, factor in licensing, training, your time, errrr will be different

[06:50:00] <enix> I was reading through some stuff AL published on everything going on and I can definitely see his side, and you start to sympathize with him, but then you stand back and see what's happened and think "fucking... wow...."
[06:50:04] <gibby> yes, a gline is global (the network) instead of a kline which is typically server or a segment of the network
[06:50:47] <catbeard> right a G line is UnrealIRCd vernacular, on Solanum the equivalent of the G line is a global TKL (global K:line)
[06:51:05] <gibby> yes
[06:51:47] <catbeard> i think all of their K lines are global though, unless they have a particular issue with a particular server which seems less likely
[06:52:10] <catbeard> because you could just reconnect and get a different server
[06:52:14] <gibby> you're right- it was a global ban last night
[06:52:27] <catbeard> if your actions were bad enough to warrant a kline then it would probably be on all servers no?
[06:52:32] <cryptic1> they glined irccloud? 
[06:52:34] <gibby> and because I've been doing a stupid ton of unrealIRCd shit lately I got them mixed up
[06:52:34] <cryptic1> hahahaha
[06:53:02] <catbeard> i mean there's a lot of abuse coming from irccloud
[06:53:13] <cryptic1> oh sure sure.gif

[07:05:07] <BWMerlin> I don't know what G lined and K lined mean
[07:06:45] <catbeard> BWMerlin: G lined on UnrealIRCd means b& from all servers on the network by ip/wildcard/range, where before that K:Lines were just on a single server, on single server networks that meant bye bye
[07:07:08] <catbeard> on Libera/Freenode as they run Solanum, it's replaced with K line, there is no G line, but K lines are global by default IIRC
[07:08:16] *** Joins: misspwn (~misspwn@user/misspwn)

[07:08:46] <BWMerlin> So what was this done?
[07:09:17] <catbeard> i think this morning libera or freenode, don't know which at this point, added a k:line for irccloud

[07:09:45] <catbeard> ah ok
[07:10:18] <a1> ~40 bucks
[07:10:19] <cryptic1> hey MikeSpears hows it going?
[07:10:26] <catbeard> MikeSpears: can't really scrub an SSD can you, not without wearing out writes?
[07:10:37] <MikeSpears> lmfao a1 they're going for 70-80 on ebay
[07:10:46] <MikeSpears> there's secure erase methods for ssds
[07:10:47] <a1> what's your point, you said best offer
[07:10:50] <a1> you see any other offers?
[07:10:59] <MikeSpears> $40 is way tool ow
[07:11:01] <MikeSpears> too*
[07:11:03] <MikeSpears> low*
[07:11:33] <riff-IRC> MikeSpears: have you used hdparm to send ATA_SECURE_ERASE to the SSD?
[07:11:33] <MikeSpears> I'll throw it in my desktop and use it for something stupid lol
[07:11:35] <catbeard> if i were interested i'd counter shfifty five
[07:12:04] <catbeard> riff-IRC: ya that tends to mess with firmware iirc, or just plain doesn't work on ssd
[07:12:05] <MikeSpears> riff-IRC nah, but it's never been used for anything of real importance, so no data to be concerned about
[07:12:33] <riff-IRC> ATA_SECURE_ERASE on an SSD does more than just wipe it
[07:12:44] <MikeSpears> ahh
[07:12:51] <Cl0udNinja> sigh idk why I even play that fucking game sometimes...  play a game to relax and find myself more pissed than before I played it
[07:12:52] <catbeard> right but it's consumer ssd to gotta worry about # writes too
[07:12:59] <catbeard> *so
[07:13:11] <riff-IRC> It basically resets the blocks, making it a bit faster, too
[07:13:12] <catbeard> if it's gonna be writing 0 and 1s that's still writes
[07:13:15] <MikeSpears> I can toss it back into something
[07:13:37] <MikeSpears> if someone's serious, I'll throw it into a computer, and spin up partedmagic
[07:13:56] <MikeSpears> pull a SMART or whatever someone would want
[07:13:59] <catbeard> or are you doing like shred /dev/sda2
[07:14:09] <riff-IRC> A bog-standard DBAN procedure WILL NOT FULLY ERASE an SSD.

[07:15:41] <catbeard> maybe
[07:16:28] <riff-IRC> ATA_SECURE_ERASE is the ONLY guaranteed way to wipe an SSD.
[07:16:34] <catbeard> if you can trigger the ssd's onboard/native security erase prodecure with it mounted
[07:16:57] <catbeard> physically mounted, not mount mounted
[07:17:21] <riff-IRC> It writes zeroes to every block in the NAND, whether it's user-accessible, overprovisioning, or reserved for wear leveling
[07:17:22] <catbeard> then like cfdisk /dev/sdb and delete all the partitions, write, quit

[10:02:50] <JollyRgrs> enix: i was just talking to my daughter the other day about iphone vs android (she went iphone b/c it works with her hearing aid, it was a hard choice for me)
[10:03:16] <JollyRgrs> i told her it was harder to find free apps on iOS, but since she really just does the mainstream (insta, tik tok, etc.) it doesn't really phase her at all
[10:03:25] <JollyRgrs> but for RDP clients and IRC clients... yeah, it makes a diff
[10:03:27] <enix> Far out, that was a rollercoaster of a sentence... In my head I was expecting you to say "because all her friends have one" or something stupid like that
[10:03:46] <catbeard> how many boxes does your daughter have root on
[10:03:56] <enix> :O
[10:04:02] <JollyRgrs> i think apple makes devs pay something to be on the store and so they have to "Get their money back" is what I've heard... from numerous people who put their software on android for free and same client is paid on iOS
[10:04:16] <JollyRgrs> catbeard: i'm not going to discuss that in here
[10:04:49] <JollyRgrs> honestly, the only thing she notices that is different is that the apps are better kept up (you know how the devs always favor iOS devices)
[10:05:06] <JollyRgrs> but she misses the shortcuts for google home on her pixel phone b/c she has some smart lights in her room
[10:05:17] <enix> I'd be surprised if a hearing aid doesn't offer Android support. That's make a very serious assumption about how muchmoney people with disabilities have..
[10:05:36] <enix> That's actually really disappointing
[10:05:39] <catbeard> like bluetooth hearing aid?
[10:05:57] <enix> catbeard: we/they also collected a lot of analytical data from the devices to imrpove them
[10:06:08] <enix> Doctor would pull from the main unit and upload via aportal
[10:06:11] <catbeard> BOOP BOOP BOOP ALTEC LANSING! POWERING ON!!!!1
[10:06:24] <enix> That would go through to get analyzed by nerdier people than me
[10:06:32] <JollyRgrs> catbeard: it does have BT connectivity for some audio stuff. but the biggest thing is being able to configure the hearing aid on the fly
[10:06:33] <catbeard> right in the damn ear canal at max vol
[10:06:43] <JollyRgrs> they have an android app, but it is absolutely booty and basically shouldn't even exist
[10:07:03] <enix> JollyRgrs: iPhones are really good. Apps are way nicer, even Plexamp, and they feel more refined for sure. I reckon the Apples SDK would be 'better' than androids but probably more restrictive too
[10:07:04] <catbeard> she could bug a room and listen in on a remote bluetooth speaker
[10:07:34] <enix> If you have any form of automation though... I'm not super keen on siri hey
[10:07:37] <enix> She dumb
[10:07:42] <JollyRgrs> enix: pretty much it boils down to most likely more devs work on iOS b/c more iOS apps are paid apps and they get money for it
[10:07:45] <enix> Google Home knows my voice so damn well
[10:07:48] <JollyRgrs> android apps it's all about money from ads
[10:08:09] <enix> I actually have less of a problem with that these days, surprisingly
[10:08:30] <JollyRgrs> i do, too b/c i use steve's blacklist in my unbound dns

[10:15:25] <enix> It's a competely different set of functionality.

[10:18:04] <JollyRgrs> this whole article is really just about the fact that they are now officially evaluated/certified
[10:18:18] <catbeard> BTLE has been around for a while too bud, so have hearing aids
[10:18:20] <enix> Where you can adjust a bunch of other things. It has nothing to do with in-app support, or streaming music/calls
[10:18:38] <JollyRgrs> i mean, a BT device, whether ear buds or over the air or a hearing aid device... it's a BT spec

[10:23:01] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> at least loop systems didn't drain your battery
[10:23:11] <JollyRgrs> apple always is late to adopt... they don't want any potential bugs or degredation to the experience for their snowflake users
[10:23:14] <enix> I have a theory too.. Apple claims (iirc) that thunderbolt is on iphones because of data transfer rates or something
[10:23:21] <catbeard> apple will automatically share control of your chastity devices with your iMessage friends
[10:23:25] <catbeard> :D
[10:23:27] <enix> I reckon they're just making a killing on licensing
[10:23:36] <enix> And if they go USB-C, they'll have to pay for that instead of get paid

[10:23:57] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> usbc is too big for aids

[10:32:02] <catbeard> ;)
[10:32:07] <JollyRgrs> so i just wifi all the IoT things at the moment
[10:32:38] <JollyRgrs> only downside is my front door lock (schlage), the wifi one doesn't support unlocking via google... only locking
[10:32:50] <JollyRgrs> has to deal with how accounts are authed, etc. etc.
[10:33:08] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> doesn't zigbee has a longer range?
[10:33:16] <JollyRgrs> but... in the end, i'm prob. glad i can't use HA to unlock my front door
[10:33:38] <JollyRgrs> zigbee and z-wave... i forget which one... they work as a mesh

[14:24:45] <hbjy> Question to all you guys - What's a good way in your opinions of connecting multi-cloud VMs with each other and also with an on-premise infrastructure set?
[14:24:51] <hbjy> (all VMs in question are Linux)
[14:25:23] <shibboleth> is that.... "multi-cloud" or simply diff vps providers?
[14:26:01] <hbjy> Diff VPS providers.
[14:26:55] <shibboleth> good, i thought "cloud" was going through yet another hilarious buzzword inflation
[14:27:02] <shibboleth> a... vpn?
[14:27:08] <hbjy> Ah, no lol
[14:27:19] <hbjy> I mean multicloud in the literal sense of "we use multiple clouds" lol
[14:27:44] <hbjy> Anyway, I probably should have been a bit more specific - I know it'd be a VPN, but I also know there's multiple ways of doing so
[14:29:38] <shibboleth> not sure if "linux vms" on diff vps providers really constitutes "multicloud", but
[14:29:54] <xe0n> he means different locations, jeez lol
[14:29:59] <xe0n> i knew what he meant lol!
[14:30:39] <shibboleth> you know, in 2012 websters dictionary literally changed the meaning of "literally" to mean "figuratively" so at this point i'm kinda jaded
[14:30:53] <shibboleth> hence me asking for clarification
[14:31:09] <xe0n> :P
[14:32:13] <shibboleth> i have a feeling that at some point in the future we will (hopefully) discover that lead in the water isn't limited to flint, michigan
[14:38:05] <sd_> 11<g​iraffe> Hot take: I don’t think point release distros are always more stable than rolling release ones.
[14:38:07] <hbjy> Well, I don't know if I should look into implementing OpenVPN, Wireguard or something else entirely
[14:38:33] <shibboleth> well, wireguard is nice and all, but why not openvpn?
[14:39:02] <shibboleth> run both server and client on each location
[14:39:24] <xe0n> no, site-to-site vpn
[14:39:29] <xe0n> then just do the routes
[14:39:31] <shibboleth> ehm
[14:39:35] <shibboleth> ehm?
[14:40:02] <shibboleth> so... what if the location that happens to be offline is also the gateway/server?
[14:40:07] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> doesn't each platform have it's own vpn solution?
[14:40:26] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> failing that setup a fortigate vm then setup a vpn with bgp
[14:40:39] <xe0n> yeah plenty of options
[14:40:46] <shibboleth> sure, there are black-box vpns like cisco, checkpoint, et al
[14:40:49] <xe0n> you'd need to compare them all, price etc etc, management and all that fun stuff
[14:41:06] <xe0n> answer depends on business needs and other factors lol
[14:41:07] <shibboleth> windows has a neutered l2tp/pp+ipsec implementation
[14:41:23] <shibboleth> which... conspicuously doesn't support PFS last time i looked
[14:41:26] <sd_> 07<x​oxo> why would you even mention checkpoint
[14:42:10] <shibboleth> for the best cross-platform support? openvpn, definately
[14:42:36] <shibboleth> oh, fortinet/juniper is any less sunken-cost-y? :P
[14:42:40] <hbjy> Luckily I don't need to give 2 shits about Windows haha
[14:42:51] <shibboleth> well, ios, droid, linux, windows, mac
[14:43:04] <hbjy> I'm basically ONLY connecting linux infrastructure
[14:43:46] <shibboleth> definitely, not definately
[14:44:06] <shibboleth> well, then go with... operavpn for all i care. you asked, i answered
[14:44:33] <xe0n> who cares what os it is, it's separate networks, look at it like that lol
[14:46:51] <hbjy> Well, I basically want to make it seem like everything is on ONE network

[14:47:12] <xe0n> hbjy...yes
[14:47:13] <xe0n> i know
[14:47:30] <xe0n> they support site-to-site vpn over ssl now?
[14:47:39] <xe0n> didnt think that was a thing..., knew server-client...
[14:47:55] <CptLuxx> no client vpn
[14:47:59] <CptLuxx> oh yeah they do
[14:48:10] <CptLuxx> between fortigates ofcourse
[14:48:11] <hbjy> For site-to-site, I feel like Wireguard with a dedicated gateway box is going to be a good option?
[14:48:24] <xe0n> you're going to have a dedicated gateway at each site period
[14:48:25] <xe0n> lol!
[14:48:45] <hbjy> Well, not necessarily
[14:48:53] <xe0n> loll
[14:49:04] <hbjy> I could just connect each cloud VM directly to the onprem network
[14:49:09] <xe0n> oh god
[14:49:10] <xe0n> lol
[14:49:20] <xe0n> okay if you're a that level of thinking, stop, refresh :P
[14:49:22] <xe0n> how much overhead is that
[14:49:24] <xe0n> loll
[14:49:33] <shibboleth> <shibboleth> run both server and client on each location
[14:49:38] <shibboleth> <xe0n> no, site-to-site vpn
[14:49:43] <shibboleth> <shibboleth> so... what if the location that happens to be offline is also the gateway/server?
[14:49:49] <shibboleth> <hbjy> For site-to-site, I feel like Wireguard with a dedicated gateway box is going to be a good option?
[14:49:49] <xe0n> you have multiple routes?
[14:50:04] <shibboleth> are the acoustics in here really bad or something?
[14:50:07] <xe0n> this is pretty stock standard stuff :P
[14:50:22] <hbjy> ...and I'm a beginner to it
[14:50:26] <xe0n> yup
[14:50:28] <hbjy> Which is why I'm asking for ideas
[14:50:39] <xe0n> sure, not sure what shibboleth is going on about lol
[14:51:00] <xe0n> im saying get a firewall or vpn appliance at each site, set up connections to each site, do some routes
[14:51:03] <xe0n> so you can route between them
[14:51:19] <shibboleth> i said server-per-location, you said client-to-client, i sad bad idea
[14:51:23] <xe0n> same methodology as different on-prem solutions?
[14:51:34] <xe0n> i said gateway per site and then routes
[14:51:40] <shibboleth> then you said server-per-location
[14:51:45] <xe0n> i said gateway!
[14:51:51] <xe0n> could be a fucking firewall appliance
[14:51:58] <xe0n> or an opnwhatever appliance
[14:52:23] <xe0n> kinda like how...if i have multiple sites at physical locations, how am i going to connect them? vpn..
[14:52:23] <xe0n> lol
[14:52:38] <xe0n> so i'd buy a firewall appliance for each site, configure wan, configure vpn
[14:52:41] <xe0n> :P
[14:53:41] <hbjy> Okay, and I'm using VPS providers, not larger clouds that provide ootb ASA stuff or site-to-site functionality, so in a way that both would and wouldn't work, unless I'm misunderstanding
[14:53:58] <xe0n> sure, its just vpn tunnels and routing?
[14:53:59] <xe0n> lol
[14:54:14] <xe0n> byo vpn?
[14:54:15] <shibboleth> <shibboleth> is that.... "multi-cloud" or simply diff vps providers?
[14:54:18] <shibboleth> <hbjy> Diff VPS providers.
[14:54:24] <shibboleth> <shibboleth> good, i thought "cloud" was going through yet another hilarious buzzword inflation
[14:54:30] <shibboleth> <hbjy> I mean multicloud in the literal sense of "we use multiple clouds" lol

[22:49:16] <JollyRgrs> you want each user to have their own personal certificate, if nothing else, for audit trails. but since they each have their own certificate, then you populate the authorized_hosts with the certificates of the users who you want to grant access. if you're looking to do this in a more automated fashion, I'm not the guy to ask, but someone else in here probably knows

[23:12:56] <haljhon> I think your confusion here is that you're confusing the way that SSH works for certificate authentication with the way that PKI works
[23:14:32] <haljhon> Actually, SSH doesn't even use "certificates", they are called keys
[23:15:01] <haljhon> Each party exchanges their keys and mutually accepts the other in key-based authentication.
[23:15:15] <shibboleth> actually, ssh can use certificates
[23:15:32] <sd_> 03<C​ory San> what do you mean?

[23:22:01] <sd_> 11<c​evapi> I’m a diehard AMD fan so I’ll most likely have to look into a ryzen gpu because theres no way I’m going intel for cpu
[23:22:09] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> i dont care about the public key, only the private key, which the user holds, can be used for authentication
[23:22:14] <sd_> 11<c​evapi> Anyways thanks👍🏻
[23:22:31] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> the public key can be seen by everyone, used by no one but the user
[23:23:36] <sd_> 03<C​ory San> So others can see the pub key and signature but cant use it because they dont have provate key?
[23:24:28] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> yes, thats true for JUST public key, or public key with signed key. Because the certificate, like the ssh key has two parts
[23:24:57] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> a public and a private. Only the private part is used to sign the key, which i hold. The public side is put on all the servers
[23:25:05] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> additionally, hold on. wait for this
[23:25:10] <sd_> 03<C​ory San> How do you manage revocation? say your CA sign pubkey for use with 30 day expiry, but guy gets fired the next day
[23:25:19] <sd_> 03<C​ory San> How do you revoke access?
[23:25:23] <shibboleth> crl?
[23:25:38] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> i can sign one user for multiple user names. I.e. Arlion, root, centos, ubuntu. All are valid username for my public key
[23:25:48] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> CRL, also stored in git
[23:25:57] <sd_> 03<C​ory San> what is CRL?
[23:26:20] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> certificate revocation list
[23:26:33] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> a list of all the certs that might be in the wild that i no longer grant access too
[23:26:52] <sd_> 03<C​ory San> CRL gets deployed to servers?
[23:27:18] <sd_> 03<C​ory San> You have to go into each machine and update it?
[23:27:56] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> the CRL is stored in git, but as a http address. https://mygit.server/crlList.txt The remote server checks that server an makes sure that the certificate that is being used isn't on the CRL
[23:28:29] <sd_> 03<C​ory San> checks real time or updates local copy from there periodically?
[23:28:40] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> uhhh, i dont recall what the interval is to be honest.
[23:28:58] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> I do know that it is not an immediate thing.
[23:29:06] <sd_> 03<C​ory San> Any good guide you could recommend for me to set this up?
[23:29:09] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> like it does take 24 hours for the cert to fully die
[23:29:41] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> dude im playing turbo sit n gos give me a sec

[23:31:09] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> this is for when you already have a cert/key file to sign with
[23:31:57] <sd_> 03<C​ory San> Do you maintain who has access to what server in git as well?
[23:32:12] <sd_> 03<C​ory San> Like you have each rule stored as file and description?
[23:32:35] <sd_> 03<C​ory San> Like what does you git repo look like?
[23:33:57] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> uhh, read that link for the theory of operation. There isn't an ACL that one would typically expect
[23:34:22] <sd_> 03<C​ory San> cool thanks
[23:34:38] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> the acl lives in the signed certificate.
[23:35:31] <sd_> 03<C​ory San> So one signed cert per person/key regardless of users/servers its going to access
[23:35:36] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> the pub key contains things like hostnames that are granted, user names that allowed to be used.
[23:35:42] *** Quits: haljhon (~quassel@user/haljhon) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:35:51] <sd_> 03<C​ory San> makes sense, thanks a lot
[23:36:57] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> i dont blame you if it doesn;t
[23:37:01] <sd_> 03<A​rlion> its pretty hard lol
