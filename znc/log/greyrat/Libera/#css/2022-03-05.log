[02:52:50] <jargon> http://puzzlum.org/test/
[03:13:56] <\f> jargon: on your `tray` classes, apply: `display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;`.
[03:15:46] *** Quits: LucaTM (~LucaTM@user/lucatm) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[03:15:59] <\f> jargon: if you are trying to position and align stuff in one direction (in this case, from top to bottom, centered), flex is often what you’re looking for.
[03:19:28] <\f> jargon: a quick tip to use _during development_ is to set `* { outline: 2px solid red; }` so you can see the boxes that you’re trying to manipulate to build your layout. This helps you think about them as such and also helps you to consider their relationships when you go about writing your CSS.

[03:30:52] <jargon> How do I fix the hexdot graphic, repositories text and icon centering?
[03:31:53] <jargon> actually the repositories text is okay, the 3 to the left are too big.
[03:35:21] <\f> jargon: For the text, you have an `<a>` wrapping the last one that applies some styles to the text the other 3 don’t have.
[03:35:49] <\f> For the rest, you just need to find the box that is the parent of both the icon and the caption and apply the flexbox style I gave you above.
[03:36:51] <\f> e.g. tray1, tray2.
[03:38:42] <\f> Gotta go now. Good luck!
