[00:10:21] <cherim> For the D->D map, you can send z to 0 with an automorphism f of D, and |z| to 0 by another automorphism g. Then |f(w)|>=|g(|w|) by hyperbolic triangle inequality, and you can tie both ends with scaling?
[00:15:02] <rubiksdream> sorry, why is |f(w)| >= |g(|w|)|?
[00:15:18] <rubiksdream> and im not sure what 'tie both ends with scaling' means here
[00:15:27] <cherim> Automorphisms preserve hyperbolic distances
[00:15:41] <rubiksdream> yes
[00:16:16] <munkis> are there any tools which given a set of points will try to generate a function they are a graph of?
[00:16:21] <cherim> Is d(z, w)>=d(|z|, |w|)?
[00:16:28] <rubiksdream> that is what im trying to prove
[00:16:37] <rubiksdream> (well thats why i asked the original question)
[00:16:48] <rubiksdream> self maps are contractions of the hyperblic distance
[00:16:53] <rubiksdream> automorphisms are isometries
[00:17:05] <cherim> You have a triangle 0, z, w
[00:17:22] <cherim> d(0, w)=d(0, |w|) and similarly for z
[00:17:40] <rubiksdream> right
[00:17:41] <cherim> One has angle 0, another arbitrary

[00:56:55] <Z-module> well, direct product of Sylows can be nonabelian, is my point.  Just take a nonabelian p-group, like Q_8
[00:58:01] <Z-module> it can even happen for squarefree orders: take the nontrivial semidirect product C_7 x| C_3
[00:58:25] <Z-module> oh sorry, that's not nilpotent
[00:59:00] <Z-module> yeah, the only finite nilpotent nonabelian groups are those for which at least one of the Sylows is itself nonabelian (thus of order p^3 or higher power)
[00:59:48] <cherim> Kind of obvious from direct product you stated

[07:27:23] <PlanckWalk> In any region where y > 0, y'/y = d/dt ln(y) = x-1.
[07:28:12] <PlanckWalk> If x is continuous in some bounded interval, then ln(y) is also bounded.
[07:29:31] <PlanckWalk> By ln(y) goes to -inf as t -> t1
[07:29:53] <PlanckWalk> But*
[07:30:29] <PlanckWalk> Err, if x is continuous and bounded*
[07:30:54] <PlanckWalk> So the conclusion is that x can't be bounded in that interval.
[07:31:03] <rex> ok so because x is periodic, it suffices to look at the interval [0,T]. Since x is continouus it assumes its maximum and minimum on a closed interval
[07:31:22] <PlanckWalk> We don't know x is periodic, do we?  Isn't that what you're trying to prove?
[07:31:49] <rex> actually according to the text, this can be assumed without proof
[07:31:54] <PlanckWalk> Oh.  I totally misread the question then.
[07:32:33] <PlanckWalk> But anyway, that's enough to show that you can't have y =0
[07:33:54] <rex> ok so x - 1 assumems max and min and therefore y'/y which is d/dt ln y

[09:54:12] <PlanckWalk> Oops, I mis-thought that.
[09:57:08] <PlanckWalk> Yes, you can enumerate (and compare) elements of finite groups from their presentation.

[09:58:38] <Fangs> even worse, it has two parameter prime p and some integer r with r^2 +1 = 0 mod p
[09:59:33] <PlanckWalk> E.g. a really inefficient way, enumerate through all finite groups until you find one that satisfies the relations.
[10:00:26] <ksft> PlanckWalk: how do you know it's the right one?

[10:20:16] <PlanckWalk> The English phrasing "for all, but finitely many, primes" is a bit off.  Taken literally it would mean "for all primes, of which there are finitely many"

[10:56:05] <susam> There is a bit of more subtelty than "injection" stuffing stuff into something bigger. What is crucial for "injection" f: X -> Y is that every element y in Y is mapped to at most one element x in X.
[10:56:31] <PlanckWalk> Yes, I gather this is a mnemonic for just which means which.
[10:57:12] <susam> The mnemonics "one-to-one" for injection and "onto" for surjection seem to work for me.

[10:57:44] <susam> Yes, makes sense.

[18:20:34] <rubiksdream> kind of a hacky way to prove some poly in k[X,Y] with either X or Y degree <= 3 is irreducible is to use the rational roots theorem, i.e. think of it as a poly in (k[X])[Y] if it has Y-degree <= 3, check the gcd of its coefficients is 1 (or its not irreducible) , and then see if u(x)/v(x) is a root for u dividing the final coefficient and v the first

[20:36:09] <lpapp> ok, thanks, so there is one thing I do not understand in our code, maybe you can help:
[20:37:01] <lpapp> vector b is normalised before calling a.dot(b) / b_original_length
[20:37:03] <lpapp> why is that?
[20:37:13] <lpapp> why does it have to be normalised to get a's force alongside b?
[20:37:22] <lpapp> normalise is just making it a unit vector
[20:38:05] <lpapp> float normalize() { float d = length() if (d) *this *= (1.0f / d ); return d; }
[20:39:28] <greenbagels> if b is normalized then you don't have to divide by the length
[20:39:35] <elichai2> This is basically what I'm trying to do: (including the commented out lines) https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=bf5743791966d8cb8f9c97690a8c6953
[20:39:52] <greenbagels> lpapp: read the link i gave you, and look for the line with the unit vector in it
[20:39:55] <greenbagels> that is what your code is doing
[20:40:07] <lpapp> yeah, this was my original concern, as well
[20:40:10] <lpapp> why divide if unit vector
[20:40:17] <lpapp> it would not cause issues if divided by the unit length
[20:40:21] <lpapp> but the original length is weird
[20:42:29] <elichai2> ops I was at the wrong channel. Sorry!!

[21:31:35] <solenia> people, can i ask you a personal question... and feel free to troll i won't hold it against you... why should i learn math? i am trying to be a good scientist, but i have been rejected from every single position for the past 10 years... i love learning, and i want to demonstrate that by contributing to research,,, but it seems my passion is not required neither in academia nor industry... so why
[21:31:37] <solenia> should i continue learning science and math? what is the point?
[21:32:55] <lpapp> greenbagels: I assume once I do the dot product and get the distance, I can multiply the unit vector unto which we project by that scalar to get a vector in that direction?
[21:32:59] <lpapp> for further projection from there?
[21:33:27] <lpapp> (unto another vector)
[21:33:52] <CyberYoda> solenia: Science and Math let you predict the future.
[21:34:21] <greenbagels> the dot product gives you a scalar lpapp; if you multiply this scalar by any vector, you will change the vector's length by that scalar factor
[21:34:47] <lpapp> greenbagels: yes, maybe I can show with screenshots what I am trying to do?
[21:34:53] <lpapp> so that we know we are talking about
[21:35:06] <lpapp> what*
[21:36:03] <greenbagels> im not being vague because i have to, im just trying to help you reason it out without giving too many breadcrumbs :D

[21:36:37] <lpapp> I am working on a 3D software

[21:37:15] <solenia> CyberYoda: thank you for your input, i do not mean to troll, but that seems like an answer to a child, i am sorry, i have heard this before. i am not young. i am a bit dipressed because i spend a lot of time learning, but can't show it off, and now starting to ask myself, what is the point...

[23:13:36] <loopspace> Why does this claim that there are 3 2-Sylow subgroups in Z_12? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/lZPDYbyW/image.png
[23:13:44] <loopspace> https://groupprops.subwiki.org/wiki/Subgroup_structure_of_groups_of_order_12#2-Sylow_subgroups
[23:13:58] <rubiksdream> dk657 if its in the schwarz class
[23:14:04] <rubiksdream> (is one possible condition)
[23:17:02] <riv> loopspace, well we should expect n_2 | 6 and n_2 = 1 (2) (Sylows theorems) so 3 is a reasonable value
[23:17:26] <riv> I cna'tthink what they would be exactly.. C_12 = C_4 x C_3 doesn't it?  so we have C_2 and C_4 as subgroups there..
[23:17:37] <int-e> Z_12 has only one subgroup of order 4.
[23:17:55] <riv> so it is wrong?
[23:17:58] <loopspace> Aren't the 2-Sylows conjugate? so in an abelian group, wouldn't n_2 be 1?
[23:18:14] <int-e> it's probably a typo
[23:18:42] <riv> oh yes great point, in an abelian group n_p = 1
[23:18:47] <glestrade> Hey folks - likely a trivial question: I’m reading a Machine Learning paper where random noise is being sampled from a Laplacian distribution. The only issue is that only one parameter is expressed (namely the scale parameter). I wonder if it’s okay to assume a 0 for the location parameter?

[23:20:13] <dk657> glestrade: yes, probably. it's a bit sloppy not to specify that the noise is mean-zero though
[23:21:10] <glestrade> I know, right?! A lot of these ML papers make a bunch of implicit assumptions about what you already know - beyond what’s reasonable imho
[23:21:40] <laurus> If I have two linear transformations S and T, both from a linear space X to itself, where γ is not the identity transform, and I have T = γ^{-1} S γ, I can choose bases A, B for X such that [γ]_A^B is now a change-of-basis matrix. Doesn't this now imply that T and S must be the same linear transformation?

[23:23:29] <dk657> rubiksdream: hm, thank you. i think that's probably too strong for my setting
[23:23:38] <laurus> riv: But my point is, doesn't choosing the bases such that the matrix is now a change-of-basis matrix /mean/ that γ is now the identity transformation?

[23:26:39] <laurus> Like, a change of basis matrix takes a point and returns that same point in a different basis. So it is a matrix represntation of the identity transformation isn't it?
[23:26:57] <riv> hmm
[23:28:10] <laurus> I am starting to think that the whole "linear transformations are similar" type of terminology is meaningless
[23:28:31] <laurus> I am beginning to believe that it is only proper to talk about similar _matrices_
[23:31:20] <laurus> Like, I get how you could take a function Φ: T -> γ^{-1} T γ where γ is invertible. Then you could say that T and γ^{-1} T γ are "similar"
[23:32:17] <laurus> Sorry, I should have written it like this: Φ: S -> γ^{-1} S γ. Then T = γ^{-1} S γ. T and S are "similar"
