[01:20:06] <e36freak> or you want to duplicate the line after it?
[01:20:35] <greycat> I can't figure it out either.  Somehow there are at least two input files, and there's at least one output file, but god only knows what they want to do.
[01:20:50] <e36freak> but yes, storing current and previous is the way to do it. just delay printing by one line
[01:21:34] <Kabouik> Let me rephrase, sorry. I have a `cats` file that contains a list of 3-letter codes. I need to create multiple other scripts that are specific to each of these codes. I have a first script manually written, and named with the code in its name (i.e., aat.py). I would want to make a create-scripts.sh that would take `cats` and `aat.py` as base files to create all other `*.py` files, using `sed s/aat/nextlinecode/ > nextlinecode.py`.
[01:22:35] <greycat> You're a python programmer?  Then why are you doing this in (ba)sh?  Do it in python.
[01:22:52] <e36freak> sounds like you basically just want a template file
[01:22:55] <Kabouik> I meant `sed s/aat/nextlinecode/ aat.py > nextlinecode.py` of course, my bad
[01:23:04] <greycat> a weird-ass template problem, yeah
[01:23:06] <e36freak> then to loop over each line and replace the template thing with the contents of the current line
[01:23:31] <Kabouik> No, not at all. Unfortunately I only know how to code in R, which won't help here. I just re-use someone else's python script.
[01:23:34] <greycat> but as long as the lines of the first input file are just letters, there's no problem doing this with sed.  there won't be a code injection problem with letters.

[07:22:51] <mrjpaxton[m]> I usually use ".sh" or any other extension, like ".py", ".pl", etc... specifically when I want to put a program in my ~/.local/bin folder. It helps distinguish them for me better. Anything else that a package installs in /bin, /sbin or /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, or whatever, usually tends to not have an extension anyway.

[07:30:49] <mrjpaxton[m]> It might be safer to use extensions in ~/.local/bin anyway. What if another program decides to run a program of the same name that's in your "~/.local/bin" path, and it runs the local version instead of the one in "/usr/bin"?
[07:31:20] <mrjpaxton[m]> I guess the same thing can be said for bash aliases and function, but I digress...
[07:32:10] <mrjpaxton[m]> At least those can only be run within a bash login shell (or sometimes interactive).

[09:16:28] <mrjpaxton[m]> `apt-cache search` works too, but for APT repos instead. Also, I don't think there is an `apt-file` on my system. Is that `aptitude` specific?
[09:17:15] <mrjpaxton[m]> I guess there's `dpkg -l | grep <pkg name>`, but this doesn't apply to the names of binaries, just package names.
[09:17:55] <twb> "apt search", "apt-cache search", and "aptitude search" cannot see the actual files, only package names, descriptions, &c
[09:18:13] <twb> "apt-file" fetches a separate database (Contents.xz) which lists every file in Debian.
[09:20:45] <mrjpaxton[m]> Well `apt-file` isn't installed on Debian by default. Maybe Ubuntu (I don't use Ubuntu at the moment). Seems like a moderately useful tool though.

[16:20:22] <ormaaj> or automate the editor across the servers. this is a thing the shells are bad at doing directly. For scripting it's ed (or sed -i since someone will mention it if I don't).

[16:25:43] <wwilliam> just modify the OPTIONS variable after sourcing the file?
[16:25:55] <ormaaj> meh anything you do is kinda blind. you add sufficient sanity checks based on how sure you are of system state and so on.

[16:52:20] <tangy> is '<<' a real operator in bash?
[16:52:31] <no_gravity> What is a real operator?
[16:52:52] <tangy> fair question
[16:52:57] <no_gravity> I guess it is not possible.
[16:52:58] <ormaaj> This is a funny exercise to try keeping it a valid script? I can't think of a way offhand no.
[16:53:16] <no_gravity> Because then bash would interpret hello.txt as a command.
[16:54:29] <ormaaj> well.. maybe. you want this to be the very first thing in a script that is presumably run from a blank / default environment and a shell whose invocation isn't otherwise controlled and in that case nope not much can be done.
[16:54:57] <tangy> answering my own question: yes, yes it is
[16:55:08] <lopid> f=hello.txt; …  # O:)
[16:55:31] <no_gravity> lopid: Yeah, but that would make it longer and it does not really start with hello.txt :)

[16:57:04] <grondilu> why would 'foo' and 'foo && true' be any different?
[16:57:24] <Soliton> the latter would always set $? to 0.
[16:57:27] <ormaaj> yeah a function is one way
[16:57:40] <ormaaj> (bash accepts it)
[16:58:31] <grondilu> Soliton: not if foo fails, no?
[16:59:16] <Soliton> right, i should have said it doesn't trigger set -e either way.
[16:59:35] <Soliton> in a way that preserves the exit status.
[17:00:07] <Soliton> silly workaround either way.
[17:00:36] <no_gravity> tangy: That does something different
[17:00:58] <grondilu> I'm trying to use bats-core and adding && true is the only way I can get it to work as I expect.  I don't get it.

[17:01:07] <no_gravity> tangy: ^
[17:01:10] <Soliton> !-e > grondilu
[17:01:10] <greybot> grondilu: "set -e" is an inheritance of the old bourne shell, and doesn't really work well with modern shell features. You'll really have less buggy scripts if you do the error handling manually instead of relying on the unreliable "set -e"; see http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/105

[19:23:24] <Soliton> it's probably rather that php reads stdin so it reads the file you loop over.
[19:23:42] <Soliton> php... < /dev/null
[19:25:14] <BlackBishop> it's a dumb script I don't/can't manage and from what I see it has a $stderr = fopen('php://stderr', 'w'); fwrite($stderr, '....'); fclose($stderr);
[19:25:21] <BlackBishop> my loop exits just after the ... message
[19:25:44] <BlackBishop> the param in my case in the something variable is ${line}
[19:25:59] <Soliton> you can continue focusing on stderr if you like.

[19:31:40] <BlackBishop> I can't touch it, that's why I was asking for bash workarounds :)
