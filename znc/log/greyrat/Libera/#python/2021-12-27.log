[01:01:54] <JimmyRustles> ok thanks

[01:03:07] <dodo> fwiw, looking at the source it looks entirely pointless at best
[01:04:12] <nedbat> JimmyRustles: i agree with dodo: there's nothing in that package.
[01:05:18] <JimmyRustles> i wanted to mess around with rendering basic 3d environments
[01:05:36] <nedbat> JimmyRustles: that's a good goal.  where did pyxyz enter into it?

[01:06:11] <nedbat> JimmyRustles: keep looking i guess
[01:06:28] <JimmyRustles> most of the stuff out there seemed too advanced for me, i liked the look of pyxyz cause it looked really basic

[01:18:15] <JimmyRustles> As such, to create a program that uses PyXYZ, just copy the pyxyz directory from this repository to your new project
[01:18:23] <JimmyRustles> seems easy enough
[01:18:33] <JimmyRustles> do you think this library is too underpowered to create a golf game with it?
[01:18:36] <tpr> I'm wondering if it'd make sense to use typing protocols instead of multi-inheritance to enforce interface for plugins. what would be the sanets way to make it clear for plugin developers that some of the mandatory methods are not implemented? use unittests and check for isinstance()s for wanted interfaces?
[01:18:36] <JimmyRustles> that's what i was intending to use it for

[13:55:29] * supakeen gets even more confused :)
[13:55:42] <vanessa> grawity, makes a lot of sense actually
[13:55:50] <parv> grawity, So a byte array cannot hold Unicode code points?
[13:56:06] <grawity> unicode code points don't fit in a single byte, that's the whole point
[13:56:20] <vanessa> parv, no. char is a 8 bit datatype
[13:56:38] <grawity> which is why we have UTF-8, UTF-16, etc. – several ways to represent Unicode codepoints in terms of bytes
[13:56:40] <bjs> parv: byte strings are sequences of bytes (numbers between 0-255).  If you want to turn unicode text into bytes you need to encoed it

[13:58:46] <bjs> consider the string "ø", this contains a single codepoint, but b"ø" doesn't exist. You can 'encode' it to get a byte string: "ø".encode("utf-8")  which gives you bytes([0xc3, 0xb8]) (aka b'\xc3\xb8'). In-general unicode characters don't fit into 1 byte
[14:01:52] <vanessa> it's a array of char datatype. it can fit 256 symbols only.
[14:02:03] <grawity> supakeen: have you ever worked with utf8 in perl? that's even more confusing

The files are few mbs in size so the task is I/O bound. I was thinking between requests + concurrent.futures or async httpx for the HTTP library. Then again there is conflicting info if requests Session is threadsafe or not. My program will also need to interact

Basically will I need to use my own semaphore to limit it to only do say 10 downloads at any time (even if the requests are being sent to different servers) or will it just work?

[18:37:32] <Forsaken87> hi, I've got a little problem with python subprocesses I can't find a solution for. I'm trying to render a video thumbnail using ffmpeg, which seems (according to what I found on google) to run into some kind of memory limit I am unable to solve. The relevant code looks like this: https://bpa.st/7TWA

[18:40:03] <Forsaken87> If I run it with an early "time_start" like e.g. "0:05" AND a low scale like shown with "400:300" it works fine, as soon as I increase one of the two the subprocess returns an exit code of "-9" (POSIX kill), but the ffmpeg process weirdly keeps running in the background as far as I can tell.

[20:21:34] <Forsaken87> Here the current code: https://bpa.st/6JWA - As soon as I increase the preview size beyond a certain limit the subprocess runs until timeout despite ffmpeg actually finishing. It seems to be the stdout buffer size (where the image is written) that blocks after a certain amount. As visible in the code I tried to increase the "bufsize" to 512MB, which is plenty for the result, but that did not help. Is there a way to get it working as I
[20:21:34] <Forsaken87>  intend without creating another buffer and transfering the data as it comes in?

[21:32:37] <CoolerX> Hi
[21:32:50] <CoolerX> I am trying to get the RGB bytes of an image I pixelated with pillow
[21:33:04] <CoolerX> I am using Pillow     8.4.0
[21:34:00] <CoolerX> this is the code
[21:34:01] <CoolerX> https://bpa.st/HZQA
[21:34:12] <CoolerX> for some reason the data is wrong
[21:34:30] <CoolerX> len(data) shows W*H instead of W*H*3
[21:34:45] <CoolerX> printing the data doesn't tell me much
[21:35:04] <CoolerX> The documentation is also lacking https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.tobytes
[21:35:28] <CoolerX> It does pixelate the image correctly and visually the image looks correct
[21:35:32] <CoolerX> So I am confused
[21:35:50] <CoolerX> maybe it's using some custom pallete so each pixel only requires a single byte?
[21:36:10] <CoolerX> I tried img.convert('rgb') but that throws an error saying conversion not supported
[21:36:33] <supakeen> What is the current image type then.
[21:37:03] <supakeen> Err, mode.
[21:37:04] *** Quits: LordVan (~lordvan@gentoo/developer/lordvan) (Quit: Leaving)
[21:37:22] <supakeen> Whatever PIL calls it.
[21:37:28] <CoolerX> P
[21:37:33] <CoolerX> supakeen: yes mode is P
[21:37:36] <CoolerX> format is PNG
[21:37:58] <supakeen> If you do `img.convert` it returns a new Image, not change the current one in place by the way.
[21:38:18] <CoolerX> ik
[21:38:27] <supakeen> Well, mode P is palette-based so the 'tobytes' is likely returning indexes into the palette which might contain other stuff.
[21:38:29] <CoolerX> img.convert('rgb') throws an exception
[21:38:32] <bjs> CoolerX: if img.convert fails to convert to rgb, doesn't that suggest it wasn't rgb to begin with?

[21:41:09] <CoolerX> this is a .png file
[21:41:45] <CoolerX> images/rainbow-heart.png: PNG image data, 225 x 225, 8-bit colormap, non-interlaced
[21:42:31] <CoolerX> oh derp
[21:42:41] <CoolerX> I was doing .convert('rgb')
[21:42:51] <CoolerX> the correct usage is .convert('RGB')
[21:43:02] <CoolerX> now it converts without errors
[21:43:08] <bjs> ah :)
[21:43:43] <bjs> Perhaps Pillow could've given a more helpful message than "not supported"
[21:44:12] <bjs> "Unknown mode 'rgb'" would've been a nice addition to that message
[21:44:34] <supakeen> + valid modes.
[21:45:43] <CoolerX> bjs: yeah but I think the solution is enums
[21:46:04] <bjs> CoolerX: I assume compatibility with PIL + extensions are the reason
