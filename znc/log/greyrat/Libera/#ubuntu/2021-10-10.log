[05:53:47] <silverdust> hello, I messed up something with my C headers, or some configuration for compiling C code.  I'm now unable to build some software that works in a fresh Ubuntu image in VM.  I had installed scc, tcc, musl, GNAT, others, so I'm not sure what the root cause is
[05:54:17] <silverdust> are there any packages that can help me trace back, or restore default headers?

[07:56:08] <jago092> toddc, these computers allow you to boot from an external drive but dont allow changing bios settings. if i was able to change bios settings then i could have changed it so it selects the windows boot loader before grub
[07:56:55] <jago092> toddc, im still able to get it to boot into windows by going to the boot menu and selecting windows boot loader. its just that its not the default selection when you turn it on
[07:57:27] <jago092> toddc, perhaps i could add something to grub to get it to boot into the windows bootloader quickly
[07:58:29] <toddc> need acess to bios to change boot or windows boot repair  you can add ubuntu to windows boot but i have not done that
[07:58:49] <toddc> and that would leave a trace

[16:59:19] <tomreyn> if i was in this situation, i'd do the following, in this order: test the overall hardware to ensure it's stable (memtest, cpu burn in test). replace storage wiring / connectors + connect storage to different mainboard connector; do a long smartctl self test. if that fails, or DRDY errors continue to be logged in system logs, acquire a storage which is at least (exactly) the same size as the existing one. use dd-rescue to back up all data from
[16:59:19] <tomreyn> the old storage to an image file. upload the image somewhere or get another storage to make another copy on. use testdisk to try to recover the (supposedly) lost on-disk structures.

[17:03:03] <tomreyn> anothe rpiece of info that was lacking from your latest paste were the characteristics of the LVs on vg-extra and those of the file system which you have/had mounted to /oldsystem
[17:04:10] <tomreyn> if the OS can't write to the disk / bus its primary file systems are mounted from, this could macke it lock up, yes

[17:08:25] <C0nundrum> Right :/ in wich case i have to toss the bug. I have a service to cycle the board so i use it for now. That last partition just became to unstable. If i can at least recover the old /var/lib/docker directory. That would be amazing
[17:08:43] <C0nundrum> toss the board*
[17:09:25] <C0nundrum> I already have a service on a power switch that cycles it when there is a lockup that last over 30 mins that i've been using for a couple monmths to keep it alive
[17:09:31] *** Joins: akaWolf (~akaWolf@akawolf.org)
[17:09:49] <C0nundrum> It could be the board or the cpu , i think i replaced the ram already.
[17:12:21] <tomreyn> i don't remember which mainboard and bios version or which disk and firmware you had there. you could look for firmware updates for either, but if this is old hardware which has been unstable for a long time, you probably should not spend much time on it now
[17:12:34] <C0nundrum> the hd i have the os on should be stable enough as i had it running on a shitty asrock mb on windows 8.1 and it was far more stable than the amd pc so i don't think it's storage unless linux somehow taxes it differently
