[00:22:42] <makomo> acdw: yep, i think it's handy to have a quick disposable scratch space like that. another use-case that comes to mind is pulling up a region of source code, editing a few things and copying it, e.g. when you want to discuss it with someone and want to annotate some parts in the moment
[00:22:57] <taeaad> So small things make people use Sublime or IntelliJ or VS or whatever.
[00:23:33] *** Joins: haj (~haj@ip5f5beb42.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de)
[00:23:43] <makomo> acdw: i mean sure i could just create a copy of the region, edit that and then copy the final region, but that involves manually selecting the region twice, and finding/creating a buffer to edit in manually :)
[00:24:34] <acdw> yepyep
[00:25:04] <makomo> and it gets more tedious if i want something other than copying. perhaps i can edit the buffer into some sort of specification that can be read by some function and executed in some way, etc.
[00:25:07] <makomo> i think it'll come in handy :)
[00:25:10] <acdw> i actually didn't even think about pulling up the buffer intermediately to double-check and/or edit... i just wanted to copy the text to a new buffer so that I can use different filling rules in each
[00:25:22] <acdw> but yeah.... it's a good idea. i think i feel a package coming on ... ^_^
[00:25:48] <taeaad> Though I have to respect people who spend 20 years maintaining Vim plugins. Or what are they called? Plugs?

[05:52:01] <michaelrose> Random question perhaps without a good answer.  I have a vpn connection up to mullvad sometimes. Accessing gmail via offlineimap etc doesn't work while connected however I can exclude processes both at startup or after the fact via mullvads cli tools namely by entering mullvad-exclude PROGRAM or via mullvad split-tunnel pid add PID. I already fetch mail via an external service which just tells emacs via emacsclient when new mail comes
[05:52:02] <michaelrose> in so this works fine but sending mail also fails. I use smtpmail-send-it to send mail but can't see any way to customize how it sends mail insofar as modifying the command it runs.  Is there a better way than just punting emacs entirely off the vpn?

[14:01:12] <makomo> is there some sort of guideline for when to write your functions such that they operate on a buffer vs. operate on a string?
[14:02:24] <makomo> ideally i'd like to be able to use the function in multiple contexts: easy to use interactively on a region, but also programatically (either on a region or a string that i happen to have)
[14:02:52] <makomo> is making it work on a buffer, and then using WITH-TEMP-BUFFER + INSERT for the string use-cases a common way of accomplishing that?

[14:36:04] <makomo> aidalgol: not a buffer specifically, but a region of the buffer. e.g. if you were writing some textual cipher utilities, like rot13, base64, vigenere, etc. etc., would you make them work on buffer regions on strings?
[14:36:40] <makomo> sometimes you need to programatically use those utilities. if they were written to work on buffers, you'd need to use temporary buffers for all of your operations

[14:38:45] *** Joins: lisp123 (~lisp123@5.30.23.247)
[14:40:07] <makomo> might get a little difficult when you need to compose the utilities as well, because instead of just the functions, now you need to set up this shared context (the buffer) and keep passing in the region's bounds
[14:40:14] <aidalgol> makomo: Going by rot13.el as an example, the answer is have a core function and then various wrappers that take different types of objects.
[14:40:21] *** Joins: random-nick (~random-ni@87.116.181.197)
[14:40:32] <makomo> but i guess that's not a big issue. it's solvable with a little bit of code
[14:40:36] <wasamasa> consider narrowing to avoid the region part
[14:40:50] <wasamasa> or write your code to just use the region in a smarter way, lol
[14:41:05] <wasamasa> like navigate to beginning of region, do things until end of region
[14:41:08] <makomo> aidalgol: yeah, and the core function works on a buffer, while the other ones just use WITH-TEMP-BUFFER :)
[14:41:24] <aidalgol> So `rot13-region' is the core function that takes a region, and `rot13-string' uses a temporary buffer and calls `rot13-region'
[14:41:27] <aidalgol> makomo: right
[14:41:31] <makomo> mhm :)
[14:41:31] *** Joins: jatt (~user@user/jatt)
[14:41:37] <makomo> wasamasa: yeah, narrowing comes in handy i suppose
[14:41:39] <aidalgol> I find that easier to follow than one function that tries to handle all cases.
