[02:03:58] <kuudes> rmmh, price management
[02:04:25] <kuudes> if there is oversupply, then prices will drop. cooperating with other producers, you destroy your supply so that total supply goes lower
[02:04:53] <kuudes> a common method for this in other business areas, such as steelcasting and papermills, is to buy small competitors and then close them down
[02:05:20] <kuudes> you also need to physically destroy the production equipment, as otherwise it would be trivial for a new competitor buy it for scrap and then just start production again
[02:05:51] <kuudes> which is a thing... which maybe should be criminal?
[02:06:04] <nshepperd> My guess is that it just literally wasn't worth the storage
[02:06:56] <kuudes> over here national emergency supplies are done so that the national emergency suppy agency rents storage space from the companies that normally process the things
[02:07:25] <kuudes> so basicly government just pays a little for them to keep artificially longer supply stocks, fifo as usual
[02:07:43] <kuudes> ie so that we don't have 2 years old butter in stockpile or whatnot
[02:08:54] <kuudes> ie sort of thing where the operator/stock seller put in new articles and take out same amount of old articles, and the government pays rent for the articles and space
[02:09:23] <feep> kuudes: isn't that already super illegal
[02:09:34] <feep> under like, cartel law
[02:09:45] <kuudes> destroying production equipment?
[02:09:57] <kuudes> yes, it is a cartel if information is exchanged
[02:09:57] <feep> to raise prices yes
[02:10:10] <kuudes> as long as you cooperate acausally, you are not breaching law, I think
[02:10:17] <feep> if information is not exchanged, isn't it just a violation of fiduciary duty?
[02:10:36] <kuudes> to your stockholders?
[02:10:39] <feep> yes
[02:10:41] <kuudes> but they benefit from your actions
[02:10:44] <kuudes> no loss occurs
[02:10:50] <feep> no
[02:11:00] <feep> they only benefit from your actions in the presence of illegal cooperation
[02:11:15] <saturn2> not if your stockholders are causal decision theorists
[02:11:25] <feep> assume the other companies don't destroy their production, now you can't sell competetively
[02:11:38] <feep> assume the other companies also destroy their production, now you're cooperating.
[02:11:38] <kuudes> if the board has accepted the plan, it is according to stockholder preferences, unless you can convince some court of otherwise

[02:12:24] <kuudes> you and how much money?

[03:04:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, the film *starts* with that, despite the rather rushed WP plot summary
[03:04:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not a surprise reveal at the end
[03:04:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's a very obviously telegraphed framing device

[03:22:21] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Even while consuming less coal, Watt‚Äôs engine generated roughly three time as much power as a traditional Newcomen engine, and twice as much as Smeaton‚Äôs best design. Working day and night at a steady fourteen strokes a minute, and burning 128 bushes of coal per day, it dropped the level of water in the mine by nine feet a day, going as deep as thirty-five fathoms.[31]
[03:22:22] <feepbot> Boulton‚Äôs business model for the firm was ingenious ‚Äì rather than simply sell the engines, they would license them at a fee proportional the amount of coal saved. A mechanical meter devised by Watt and kept behind a locked door would count the engine‚Äôs strokes in order to determine the level of usage. The deal signed with Wheal Busy netted Boulton & Watt ¬£700 per annum out
[03:22:22] <feepbot> of an estimated ¬£2400 saved by the mine by using the new engine. Given this kind of economic dividend, it is not surprising that by 1780 Boulton & Watt had sold forty engines, half of them to mines in Cornwall. Just five years after the formation of their partnership, the Newcomen engine was all but eradicated there.[32]'

[04:05:53] <quanticle> "However, if this trait were a simple one-gene, two-allele genetic character, with rolling completely dominant to non-rolling, then two non-rolling parents could not have a rolling child. Both studies found rolling offspring of non-rolling parents, so the trait must be more complicated than the myth says. The discrepancy could be due to more complicated genetics, involving multiple alleles or
[04:05:56] <quanticle> multiple genes, or some kind of environmental influence."

[04:53:05] <dTal> Obormot\Arcturus: E2 started out as E1, which was a kind of crowdsourced database thing, then very quickly got migrated to E2, and as the years went on the culture shifted away from short, low-effort "noding for numbers" and towards "writing". It was the source of much wailing and gnashing of teeth.

[08:46:44] <saturn2> i guess if you're cursed with strong platonist intuitions you need a lot of metaphysical gymnastics to accept the idea of self-skepticism/reservationism/whatever since you think your brain is a passive antenna directly picking up Pure Ideas
[08:47:26] <saturn2> maybe that's the reason chapman is doing the thing

[09:39:44] <feep> lol
[09:44:44] <saturn2> can't blame you tbh
[09:45:42] <quanticle> To elaborate further, the problem ("problem") is that I use youtube-dl to download youtube videos
[09:45:59] <quanticle> And youtube-dl sets the filename to be the video title
[09:46:08] <quanticle> So this results in a lot of filenames with spaces and Unicode

[09:49:43] <feep> quanticle: I don't understand why that'd be an issue in bash
[09:56:43] <quanticle> feep: It is when you're doing things like find | mv
[09:56:57] <adiabatic> why are spaces in bash so bad
[09:57:12] <quanticle> Because, by default, space => new filename
[09:57:32] <quanticle> So a file named "Hello world" is treated as "Hello" "world"
[09:57:38] <quanticle> Unless you specifically escape the spaces
[09:57:43] <quanticle> Or fuck around with $IFS

[09:57:58] <adiabatic> and if you're writing scripts, learn to quote things
[09:58:12] <feep> yeah, I generally just find |while read file; do mv "$file" ...; done

[09:58:42] <feep> nah still works p sure
[09:59:14] <feep> yeah still works
[09:59:37] <feep> that syntax is effectively magic
[09:59:40] <quanticle> Huh
[09:59:52] <saturn2> now you're thinking in posix
[10:00:08] <quanticle> feep is way better at bash than I am
[10:00:36] <feep> hence "you'll be back"
[10:00:51] <quanticle> Me, I just went back to Windows, where I can do Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter "*blah*" | Move-Item -Destination "some other location" and it Just Works‚Ñ¢

[10:01:20] <feep> right, that's my point.
[10:01:37] <quanticle> But I also have the option of using a shell that doesn't suck
[10:02:11] <quanticle> Whereas on Linux, I'd be stuck learning something like... I dunno, Oil?

[10:02:23] <quanticle> Fish?
[10:04:34] <feep> .. bash exists, you know

[11:22:40] <kuudes> good morning
[11:23:14] <kuudes> yeah, you can't use more water than it rains
[11:23:24] <kuudes> or I guess california could make a closed loop?
[11:23:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> "You know that ‚Äúprobability‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúa number which, if we redid the experiment and substituted ‚Äòpick randomly according to this number‚Äô instead of the actual casual mechanism, would give the same distribution of results‚Äù?" ... it doesn't?
[11:23:41] <kuudes> clean the waste water and then sprinkle it back on the upstream mountains?
[11:23:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Isn't that exactly what it means
[11:23:56] <quanticle> That would require a lot of pumping
[11:24:30] <quanticle> kuudes: I think the main problem is that climate change is shifting rainfall patterns so California isn't getting as much rain as it used to
[11:24:59] <quanticle> This is leading to increased pressure on groundwater supplies as people try to make up the deficit with fossil water
[11:25:49] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: that's a matter of opinion
[11:27:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: How's that
[11:28:36] <saturn2> probabilities can be degrees of belief, or ratios of long-run frequencies, or other things
[11:29:23] <nshepperd2> if you redo the experiment and pick randomly instead of whatever it originally was, that might cause people to change their strategies
[11:29:24] <quanticle> Who knew there was such mysticism at the heart of science?
[11:29:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right, this is the part where the whole "degrees of belief" thing doesn't make any sense to me
[11:29:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: Ok, sure, I assume we're assuming away such things
[11:29:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: Indeed maybe this isn't an experiment that involves anyone's strategies at all
[11:30:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe it's about fish, or protons
[11:30:09] <nshepperd2> seems like an unreasonable thing to assume
[11:30:22] * Obormot\Arcturus shrug
[11:30:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Protons may or may not suffer but I'm pretty sure they don't change strategies on the basis of what they think the experimenter is doing
[11:32:39] <nshepperd2> anyway, clearly "probability" actually means a functional on a measurable set that obeys the kolmogorov axioms

[11:45:54] <adiabatic> but almonds are delicious and we already have the trees. you don't want to KILL the TREES, do you?

[11:46:55] <quanticle> nshepperd2: Yeah, well, hopefully before then they'll figure out water pricing

[11:47:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> dbohdan: And the dream scenario is his insecurity of "why would such a woman even stay with me? just a momentary whim probably, she might leave me at any time for more glamorous pastures"
[11:48:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Likewise, in Shurik's dream his invention is a success, his neighbors are even more eccentric and crazy than in reality, plus of course he gets to meet Ivan the Terrible, etc.)

[11:49:42] <dbohdan> Obormot\Arcturus: Yes, I agree with that!  I appreciate it more now.  But to kid-me it felt like they were cheating the audience even with the obvious shift to color and the foreshadowing.

[15:34:04] <Robomot> two kinds of people?
[15:35:23] <kuudes> we don't have shootings here in finland
[15:35:30] <feep[work]> to a first approximation, same
[15:35:38] <feep[work]> when they happen they tend to be national news
[15:35:52] <RiversHaveWings> my roommate wants a gun but she always jokes to me about wanting to kill herself
[15:35:53] <RiversHaveWings> so
[15:35:59] <kuudes> if there is a report that someone heard a gunshot, it is a big thing and then places are investigated and home searches and person searches made etc
[15:36:14] <kuudes> yes, no gun please
[15:36:27] <kuudes> if necessary, maybe get taser or spray?
[15:36:43] <kuudes> I mean, it is harder to suicide with those
[15:37:03] <Betawolf> in the UK we also usually don't have shootings but also people can shoot game without it being a major police operation
[15:37:15] <kuudes> yes, that is different
[15:37:27] <kuudes> game is not shot in cities and only in specific times
[15:38:02] <kuudes> also with permits for guns and permits from the land owner
[15:38:23] <Betawolf> right
[15:38:35] <kuudes> but I meant that there was a misfiring of a gun by someone in a bar some time recently, and it got large operations until the perp and gun was found
[15:39:27] <kuudes> and when an assault rifle was stolen from the army, the police put heavy pressure on the underground, made a fuss out of all little things and messaged that this will continue until the assault rifle appears back to police
[15:39:59] <kuudes> then the underground arranged that a person dropped a bag containing the rifle to a police who happened to stand in certain street corner and look away

[18:16:18] <Gurkenglas> Simplified from my understanding of Steven Byrnes's understanding of the brain, my neocortex makes a plan and my amygdala predicts its effects and my brainstem scores them. A plan with a high expected score is chosen, and later my neocortex is trained to improve the *accuracy* of my amygdala's predictions. Akrasia: I planned to do something, so actually doing it is not incentivized. Attack: Take the thing I was 
[18:16:18] <Gurkenglas> planning to do tomorrow, and use some of that finite willpower (slack in a mesaoptimizer that hasn't finished being trained away yet?) and brute-force change it towards the plan to not do it. Observe the bad feeling of score dropping, yep. Resolve upon the plan to decide whether to do it (by considering both options and seeing what feels better) tomorrow. Let's see if that works.
[18:17:25] <feep[work]> in my experience, akrasia is caused by smartphones and social media.
[18:17:56] <capisce> or maybe it's caused by boring work
[18:17:59] <Gurkenglas> and yet other people do fine, so i expect it's just some silly abnormality in the way i think of plans.
[18:18:24] <feep[work]> capisce: that's like saying a bridge falling into the river is caused by heavy traffic
[18:18:31] <feep[work]> sometimes a road has heavy traffic
[18:18:46] <feep[work]> this is part of the demand profile :p
[18:19:03] <capisce> work is constantly boring in my experience
[18:19:56] <feep[work]> also I maneuvered myself into a corner
[18:20:19] <feep[work]> I have completely trained my brain to associate work with techno music
[18:20:24] <feep[work]> but at home I listen to podcasts
[18:20:28] <feep[work]> and youtube videos
[18:20:41] <feep[work]> I guess it keeps me productive at work, which is the main thing
[18:22:54] <Gurkenglas> That therapist for example said I am too dissociated (predict whether i'll do something instead of resolving on it, as though it's not me making the decision), and I replied it makes me less wrong-all-the-time. Maybe I just didn't take that to its logical conclusion.
[18:23:17] <feep[work]> this matches my experience
[18:23:26] <feep[work]> resolving to do it doesn't work, that's why it's dissociated to begin with
[18:23:39] * feep[work] has instead accumulated a number of "do it hacks"
[18:23:58] <capisce> considering becoming a NEET
[18:24:43] <capisce> I predict not having the stress from work will considerably improve my life quality
[18:25:01] <feep[work]> I believe this is what FIRE is all about
[18:25:43] <capisce> if work wasn't so boring FIRE might not be a thing
[18:25:48] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], and maybe functioning people just do the thing I'm describing intuitively and call this "see-whether-something-would-feel-good-and-then-come-back-to-reality" resolving upon a plan.
[18:26:15] <feep[work]> I don't get it
[18:26:24] <feep[work]> apparently functioning people have a primitive to "do it" that functions reliably.
[18:27:28] <feep[work]> I *think* what is happening is they have more control over like ... action preference/veto strength?
[18:27:40] <capisce> maybe they're just more aligned with what they're doing
[18:27:47] <feep[work]> like, it's almost never the case that I *really don't* want to do something, it's just that I *kinda* don't want to do it and I want to do X a lot more
[18:28:05] <feep[work]> where X = refresh reddit / refresh forums / read fanfic
[18:28:39] <feep[work]> I think, if those had less activation salience, ime, if I can *keep* from doing the junkfoody thing for a few minutes, the deferred task kicks in on its own
[18:28:44] <Gurkenglas> IQ meme. Stupid: check whether something would feel good. say "ill do it". Medium: realize which parts of the brain do the resolving, resolve to do things all the time, fail exactly those times. Smart: Realize this, go back to stupid.
[18:29:19] <feep[work]> it's more that the akrasic brain operates like an overloaded cpu scheduler.
[18:29:42] <feep[work]> looped tasks continuously eat up timeslices that could be dedicated to important applications
[18:30:09] <rsaarelm> I'm currently thinking that I don't really have an idea about akrasia since most of my time has been in dysfunctional education and day jobs I don't really want to do.
[18:30:29] <feep[work]> also apparently gabberdisco = adderall, I don't understand that part
[18:30:32] <rsaarelm> Constantly dragging my feet seems to be just the expected reaction to something like that instead of a disorder.
[18:31:12] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], yeah of course the fastfood incentives override all the work you could be doing. The reason for that, according to this running theory, is that all the incentivizing power of work was expended yesterday to overwhelmingly resolve to work today.
[18:31:27] <rsaarelm> I've at least built some level of stuff I want to do, but very little anything that's both work I like doing and work that involves other people in any way.
[18:31:59] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: no that doesn't apply at all
[18:32:10] <feep[work]> I don't resolve to work yesterday
[18:32:22] <feep[work]> well, it doesn't apply to how my decision loop works at least
[18:32:32] <Gurkenglas> Might be a map-territory mismatch.
[18:32:58] <Gurkenglas> Confusing map and territory here is easy here because they're both in your head.
[18:32:59] <feep[work]> I think what's maybe happening for me with fast music is it keeps me switching *away* from the fastfood tasks before I can get reward from them
[18:33:02] <feep[work]> or something
[18:33:46] <feep[work]> and once I get stuck in the work task, I'm generally fine
[18:33:53] <Gurkenglas> Aka, are you sure that the thing you call "not resolving to work tomorrow" doesn't actually pay out the feel-good early?
[18:34:00] <feep[work]> what?
[18:34:18] <feep[work]> that's not any thing.
[18:34:44] <Gurkenglas> Okay, is there anything that you'd like to do tomorrow but you're pretty sure you won't do it?
[18:35:07] <feep[work]> hm, "pretty sure" I guess?
[18:35:16] <feep[work]> I wanna work on the irc client multipane mode
[18:37:31] <kiboneu> good morning
[18:37:45] <feep[work]> yo
[18:38:08] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[18:38:10] <Gurkenglas> Okay. Consider the plan of deciding now that you will do it. It might fail, because akrasia. If it succeeds, you'll have done work on the irc client. Does it feel, in total, like a good plan? (I'm guessing not, because if it did you would already have resolved.)
[18:38:30] <feep[work]> define good?
[18:38:35] <feep[work]> it feels like a plan with a good outcome.
[18:38:43] <feep[work]> I just don't expect it to happen.
[18:38:50] <Gurkenglas> That's an answer. Now:
[18:40:41] <Gurkenglas> Consider the plan of deciding now that you won't do it. You'll certainly not have done work on it. You'll presumably also feel bad that you failed to be the kind of person who could do things that don't look like akrasia. Does it feel, in total, like a bad, bad plan? I'm guessing yes, because that's what it felt like to me, and this feeling was obvious and left no question of "define bad?".
[18:41:14] <wrycode> I've had much less trouble with this stuff since switching to a calendar
[18:41:45] <feep[work]> Gurkenglas: I don't want to interrogate that too much because ... like, it feels bad, but it feels bad across several meta levels.
[18:42:25] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[18:42:30] <Gurkenglas> feep[work], beware that you may simply not want to interrogate that to much based on the badness feeling, not based on whether it gains you information.
[18:42:49] <feep[work]> interrogation is not a pure operation.
[18:43:13] <Gurkenglas> And I'm guessing that's the entire problem!
[18:43:17] <feep[work]> yes?
[18:43:34] <Gurkenglas> Other people do interrogation fine, and then they come back. Therefore they don't have any problems actually doing the thing later.
[18:43:45] <feep[work]> I don't buy that other people do interrogation at all.
[18:44:17] <feep[work]> I think inasmuch as they do, it's a purely internal, emotional process.
[18:44:49] <Gurkenglas> How do they decide what to say about their plans tomorrow? A *second* world model that they query about the results of actions?
[18:44:52] <feep[work]> they just "feel bad being the person who doesn't do X" without ever phrasing it in these terms
[18:44:57] <feep[work]> they don't.
[18:45:09] <feep[work]> or rather, they decide what to say about their plans tomorrow, tomorrow.
[18:45:50] <Gurkenglas> Okay, that's a fair theory we can integrate here, because it prescribes the same.
[18:46:33] <Gurkenglas> So to beat akrasia, one simply is not to emotionally consider the long-term results of plans.
[18:46:47] <Gurkenglas> Makes sense that akrasia would be rampant in the EA/AI risk crowd.
[18:47:13] <feep[work]> yeah but I think something about introspection breaks the normal mechanism
[18:47:37] <feep[work]> or maybe the other way around, the failure of the mechanism prompts introspection.
[18:47:58] <feep[work]> anyway, my parents have often reported to me that ... not just that doing tasks feels good to them, but that they expect that this is universal
[18:48:17] <feep[work]> I've had a hell of a time getting across that I do not share this sensation XD
[18:48:24] <capisce> sweet summer childs
[18:48:30] <feep[work]> ikr
[18:48:57] <feep[work]> anyway, I *really* think it has something to do with addictive/superstimulus behavior
[18:51:32] <feep[work]> but I don't know why stimulant music would affect it.
[18:51:47] <feep[work]> I mean
[18:51:57] <feep[work]> I assume stimulant music affects it for the same reason stimulants affect it
[18:52:11] <feep[work]> but one would assume it'd make the short time preference issue *worse*
[18:52:13] <Gurkenglas> Yeah, maybe both of them drown out the brainstem's signals.
[18:54:40] <feep[work]> another idea
[18:54:48] <feep[work]> maybe stimulants boost reward jitter in general

[18:55:11] <Robomot> image/png (512x512; 88 KB)
[18:55:27] <feep[work]> if short reward actions normally "always" win, with stimulus long reward actions win *sometimes* and this is enough to kick the brain into work mode
[18:55:58] <feep[work]> this matches my experience with disco, I chat a line on irc, switch back to work, type half a page, chat a bit..
[18:57:09] <feep[work]> that can't be a complete explanation though, because music with speech or singing completely ruins my focus
[18:57:36] <vrs> to be frank, working on an IRC client sounds like a displacement activity, so that's what I'd interrogate
[18:57:39] <feep[work]> or like, intelligible, meaningful singing, the sort of "singing as noise" I get in gabberdisco is fine
[18:57:45] <feep[work]> vrs: no it's actually long-term goal fulfillment
[18:58:25] <vrs> there's almost as many irc clients as there are personal todo list tools?
[18:59:29] <feep[work]> it's an ad for my compiler
[18:59:38] <feep[work]> it's a retro textmode irc client that looks like edit.com
[18:59:55] <feep[work]> the idea is instead of going "look at this compiler" I need stuff that I can advertise as a "hook" for the compiler
[19:00:13] <feep[work]> chat.com is designed to do well on hackernews
[19:00:17] <vrs> does the compiler solve a specific problem or is it more "I want to prove I can write a compiler"?
[19:00:30] <feep[work]> it's self-actualization. A language like D with macros ought to exist.
[19:00:39] <feep[work]> since nobody else seems to be making it, it falls to me.
[19:00:56] <vrs> ah, but do you have the lower levels sorted out?
[19:01:01] <feep[work]> the what?
[19:01:09] <vrs> (of the reward hierarchy)
[19:01:30] <feep[work]> well, sorta, I need to spend like nine hours a day on work and that harshes my buzz a bit, but I save about half my income so that's good
[19:02:02] <feep[work]> but that aside I'm secure on p much everything
[19:02:37] <feep[work]> social interaction could be better, I guess. but since I cannot grow cat ears I'm putting that off for now. (not that I don't have friends, but like... "social interaction half a day every day" type of investment.
[19:02:43] <feep[work]> )
[19:03:17] <feep[work]> like, my self-actualization along that axis is explicitly on pause until the singularity
[19:03:36] <vrs> that could take a very long time
[19:03:40] <feep[work]> and barring being a cute catperson, I am a person who writes compilers and raytracers~
[19:03:47] <feep[work]> probably won't tho :p did you see the openai thing
[19:04:09] <feep[work]> my current estimate is 50/50 2026.
[19:04:26] <capisce> if that's the case then I should definitely FIRE already
[19:04:34] <feep[work]> that said, I'm still behaving like FIRE by 40.
[19:04:42] <feep[work]> maybe 43.
[19:04:49] <feep[work]> depends whether I wanna live okay or well :p
[19:04:50] <vrs> I give it 10-20 years but I'm not counting on it
[19:05:10] <feep[work]> vrs: oyeah if I was not expecting that I would be behaving very differently, but this is better.
[19:05:10] <vrs> and I'm kind of hoping it won't happen
[19:05:27] <capisce> reason I'm delaying FIRE is that I want to live off the interest and not slowly eat the principal
[19:05:31] <feep[work]> vr will hopefully get about 20% there in the next decade anyway.
[19:05:42] <feep[work]> capisce: isn't that just FIRE period?
[19:05:51] <vrs> wait so what's FIRE
[19:05:51] <feep[work]> nobody doing fire should eat the principal
[19:05:58] <feep[work]> financial independence, retire early
[19:06:00] <rsaarelm> I think I've just ended up in a point where I can't stand doing a day job so might as well see if I can do the FIRE thing.
[19:06:07] <capisce> right, but if singularity will happen at some point soon maybe we should reconsider
[19:06:21] <feep[work]> capisce: might as well hedge? the singularity destroys the market anyway.
[19:06:23] <vrs> ah I'm doing financial independence, work as long as I please (part time)
[19:06:31] <feep[work]> vrs: I think that's still FIRE
[19:06:39] <feep[work]> the point is you have "fuck you savings".
[19:06:45] <vrs> I'm already working part time
[19:06:54] <capisce> but hedging might mean sacrificing a lot of hedons in the short run
[19:07:16] <feep[work]> capisce: eh, that's true. but it bottom-caps life badness too.
[19:07:27] <vrs> I don't have fuck you money but I could coast comfortably for a few years, and I figure that if there's a nontrivial chance human civilization ends in my lifetime, I might as well enjoy the way there
[19:07:42] <feep[work]> I mean, you should enjoy the way anyway :p
[19:07:57] <feep[work]> way I see it, people shouldn't plan for the singularity
[19:08:22] <feep[work]> I just happen to have some self-actualization goals that are really tailor-optimized for a singularity outcome
[19:08:22] <capisce> enjoying the journey is where I'm falling a bit short
[19:08:34] <feep[work]> and I'm holding those in reserve and working on conservative happiness goals in the meantime~
[19:09:04] <feep[work]> which is, well, retire early, write compilers and raytracers~
[19:09:14] <feep[work]> maybe work on kerbal space factory engineers
[19:09:56] <feep[work]> but my compiler is also on the critical path towards that, just by lowering the pain of writing in a shit language
[19:10:18] <feep[work]> (that's any language that exists, jsyk)
[19:10:34] <feep[work]> hahaha
[19:10:36] <capisce> are you self hosting your compiler already?
[19:10:40] <feep[work]> gabbadisco track runs out
[19:10:45] <feep[work]> immediately stop work and only chat on irc
[19:10:47] <feep[work]> fucking clockwork
[19:10:55] <feep[work]> capisce: yep, been for a year
[19:11:05] <feep[work]> capisce: it's actually really close to alpha release, I just need to get a few ducks in order
[19:11:18] <capisce> so then your compiler is no longer on the critical path towards working on your compiler
[19:11:20] <feep[work]> for unclear reasons, I can only motivate myself to work on it during holidays, not afternoons or weekends
[19:11:22] <capisce> compiler singularity
[19:11:34] <capisce> sounds like you need to FIRE pretty soon then
[19:11:49] <feep[work]> capisce: I mean, I'm kinda hoping if I popularize it, I can get a job working on it
[19:11:56] <feep[work]> or patreon/foundation support
[19:12:04] <capisce> I also lack motivation to do a bunch of stuff while having a job

[19:32:35] <Betawolf> you can just look at your saving ratio
[19:33:46] <ggreer> based on my experience with mentally ill homeless people in seattle and portland, I am surprised that lots of them aren't shot in self defense. both states have shall-issue concealed carry and both states have around 1 in 10 adults possessing such permits. I'm guessing that number is lower in cities, but still you figure the average crazy homeless person attacks one victim per day... within a month they'll see a gun barrel
[19:34:13] <ggreer> maybe they aren't as insane as they seem to be and they understand that a gun is being pointed at them and chill out?
[19:34:33] <ggreer> because some of the ones I interact with can't even speak or understand words
[19:35:25] <rsaarelm> I guess you'd expect to see noise about a bunch of homeless people being shot and killed?
[19:35:48] <rsaarelm> Otherwise it could just be that they're constantly being killed and new people are constantly dropping into homelessness.
[19:35:49] <ggreer> they'd be shot, probably killed, and there would be a person arrested for shooting them
[19:38:44] <ggreer> you'd think the following would happen at least once a year: crazy homeless guy attacks someone, gets shot and dies. the shooter is a boring middle class or upper middle class person. they're arrested and then not charged (once the evidence is clear that it's self defense). activists find out about this and try to ruin the shooter's life
[19:39:44] <shawwwn> qrqwreqw 
[19:41:29] <rsaarelm> How common are middle class people who are carrying at some random moment and will actually shoot in self-defense?
[19:43:20] <rmmh> that 10% number is probably clustered rural
[19:43:44] <rmmh> people living in the downtown core (near the homeless) are much less likely to have a CCW
[19:43:45] <rsaarelm> Also, you can probably take an intuitive guess at which sort of normal people are less-likely-to-concealed-carry phenotypes and prefer to attack those even if you're a crazy homeless person.
[19:43:45] <ggreer> rsaarelm: hmm.. it happens in vancouver wa every year but nobody protests
[19:43:52] <ggreer> and vancouver is like 200k people
[19:45:45] <ggreer> rsaarelm: yeah my guess is that they're not as crazy as they appear
[19:45:59] <capisce> maybe people are used to crazy behavior from homeless people
[19:46:08] <ggreer> also most law-abiding people *really* don't want to shoot anyone, even crazy assholes. even ignoring the morality of it, it's a colossal pain in the ass to deal with. you replace the stress of "omg is this dude gonna kill me?" with "omg is the state going to imprison me for the rest of my life?"
[19:46:45] <capisce> so they don't feel like it's a life threatening situation
[19:47:28] <ggreer> capisce: hmm... yesterday had that guy gotten a little closer or started swinging, I would have drawn on him. throwing stuff at me and following me for blocks was pretty crazy though 
[19:50:44] <ggreer> (I couldn't just run away because my girlfriend & brother were with me. they're both a lot slower)

[20:44:43] <src> agreed
[20:44:55] <ggreer> but resistance bands are definitely a better workout
[20:45:19] <capisce> and very portable
[20:45:29] <src> a few weights, stationary bike, pull up bar, push ups, sit ups, some way to do dips and you're set
[20:45:55] <src> but there's nothing intrinsic to resistance bands which makes them bad ofc
[20:45:58] <src> thing of preference
[20:46:21] <capisce> I do pull ups and dips in the park nearby
[20:46:29] <capisce> plus running

[21:10:53] <gwern> ...effort than I put into the money stuff): 2015: "yay, I can lift 200lbs 10x", 2021: "Yay, I can lift... 300lbs 10x!". not exactly the same...
