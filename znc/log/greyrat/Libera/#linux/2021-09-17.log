After some point in the past, packages I make with this process fail to install with "unable to create '/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/cgroup.procs.dpkg-new' (while processing './sys/fs/cgroup/memory/cgroup.procs'): Permission denied"

[06:39:58] <espresso> bewees1: if forced to judge on the cursory info I have, I might try 9P for performance (perhaps NFS takes more host resources).. and I am sure there's better info out there than this.  ;)

[06:43:34] <bewees1> I think 9P performs better when multiple hosts access the same disk. Only tricky thing was to add the SELinux context svirt_image_t to the directory to mount it. 9P feels also safer because I don't have to worry about IP isolation

[08:26:13] <[[R]]> fdan: sftp and scp are similar
[08:26:18] <SineDeviance> fdan: tftp is 'trivial file transfer protocol' and it's the most common FTP implementation
[08:26:21] <[[R]]> tftp is mainly for like low level etworking stuff, PXE

[09:26:45] <xous> I worked for a company for years where there was only one setup of "backups" on cheap little home NAS
[09:26:50] <xous> sitting (not mounted) in a DC
[09:27:02] <SineDeviance> yeah, that's what they had when we came in (a 4TB synology NAS)
[09:27:20] <SineDeviance> then they bought this video server with 40TB of storage and wanted us to set it up to backup to their NAS
[09:27:23] <pikajude> wow 5tb external drives are $100+
[09:27:24] <xous> haha.
[09:27:28] <pikajude> that's surprising

[09:27:38] <SineDeviance> I was like "Yeah, that's not going to work. you need at least 10x as much disk and a NAS isn't going to cut it"
[09:28:00] <xous> SineDeviance: at this it was a Synology

[10:10:33] <SineDeviance> we had a meeting with them before they bought the AVID appliance (because let's be honest, it's basically an appliance) and I detailed how I could build them a Dell server for literally half the cost that would perform as well or better. they ended up buying the AVID product anyways because they had $1,000 in credits at B&H photo/video, and because it carried the AVID nameplate
[10:10:43] <SineDeviance> the server cost something like $15,000 as configured
[10:10:54] <SineDeviance> I could have easily built a Dell for $6000? maybe less
[10:11:07] <xous> well AVID is picky
[10:11:21] <xous> they have very strict configs and will bitch if you have performance issues
[10:11:27] <SineDeviance> yeah but they don't use ANY AVID software anymore. haven't since the early 2000s

[10:12:33] <SineDeviance> I think salesman from AVID contacted them and told them it was the best thing on the market and they should get it. I think that because all of this came about all of a sudden. like, one day we were just requested to put together a quote for it

[10:15:02] <xous> I just bought a $8500 used truck and that was the most I'd ever spent on a car
[10:15:05] <SineDeviance> eh, I grew up poor. I've never had a new car. no desire to buy one with all the computerization that is going on
[10:15:24] <xous> before that it was like 2k
[10:15:26] <SineDeviance> my newest car is a 2009 honda fit, and those are not very computerized. it's really easy to maintain
[10:15:44] <Sauvin> I have no desire to own a new car because for me it's not an investment. Imagine losing 25% of the car's value for driving it off the lot.
[10:15:53] <SineDeviance> Sauvin: yep, that's also a big factor
[10:15:54] <SineDeviance> however
[10:16:05] <SineDeviance> depending on the type of car, and how you finance it, you can actually break even or make a profit
[10:16:09] <xous> yeah, the newest I think I'd go is 1-2 years old, if it was a really good deal.
[10:16:21] <Sauvin> My present car is a 2002 Corolla. It's a stick. That's why I have it.
[10:16:25] <xous> not paying that drive off the lot tax
[10:16:30] <SineDeviance> the worst thing you can ever do is pay cash outright for a new car. that is just losing huge value at the jump unless you're sure you're going to drive the wheels off

[14:18:52] <djph> node1: in most cases, I would expect normal TCP/IP ...
[14:18:52] <Takios> node1: that wholly depends on the services and general architecture. There's REST, or AMQP...

[23:54:07] * rustytaco shudders at the phrase "connected car"
[23:54:25] <rustytaco> I just want my car to drive how i tell it and not make beeps chimes or excessive blinkenlights
[23:54:28] <hexnewbie> Beware that eject has a bug and can't recover the seat if the car has reached the International Space Station
[23:54:33] <phogg> rustytaco: it's buzzy-word-y but the core concept is sound

[23:55:10] <phogg> rustytaco: if you want to build all the bits of software that are needed to operate the non-vehicle-control parts of the car then you have to establish some standards or everything is chaos
[23:55:13] <rustytaco> A little music would be nice. Some climate controls are essential for keeping the reptilian lifeforms such as myself comfortable.. but what else need i? Navigations? Ok but lets not give it a modem and microphone.. i live in a country with a very untrustworthy government...

[23:55:20] <Sauvin> Also, make a note that the 'mount' command probably won't work for anybody over the age of 30.
[23:55:22] <fakuve> phogg: sounds nice the `linux for the cars` I bet tesla is surely using loads of Free-Software on their cars
[23:55:47] <msiism> Sauvin: I thought Bond's stuff was all electro-mechanical.
[23:55:58] <phogg> fakuve: I assume they're running Linux in there, but lots of their stuff is custom and they don't share much

[23:57:05] <rustytaco> phogg: Ehh. i just deeply dont trust the government of my country, even less after being employed by them :)

[23:57:30] <fakuve> I quite hate that philosophy of modern software development of these companies . I dont know what is your opinion , but is like almost everyone are using Free-software from linux , then modifying a tiny bit , and sell it as their own software (of course with metrics and everything incorpored on it)
[23:57:38] <msiism> phogg: What if you mistype stuff, though? Especially at higher speeds in uneven terrain.
[23:57:48] <fakuve> Look at Android, you cant do anything almost nowadays without it
[23:57:48] <Wafficus> Hey there, question about harddrives: How do I tell via terminal what each of my HDD's are partitioned as, in terms of their file system?
[23:58:00] <phogg> msiism: as with anyone who has root "don't do that" is the answer
[23:58:06] <msiism> :)

[23:58:27] <fakuve> I rooted my Android , and anytime I need to do something sort of administratively with it is like "Sorry this device is rooted, you cannot access to this feature"

[23:58:41] <rustytaco> android is cancer
[23:58:41] <Pazooza> I find Fedora and Centos update yum thing is always broken.
[23:58:52] <msiism> fakuve: Also, "almost everyone" is creating that piece of Free Software called Linux. Like, it's really a big-business affair.
[23:58:53] <fakuve> Even basic paperwork with the authorities
[23:58:57] <phogg> Wafficus: blkid on the partitioned device file should help
[23:59:00] <Wafficus> fakuve: every other company I worked for just specializes in proprietary software but derives the base components from most open source web projects.
[23:59:05] <Wafficus> phogg:  thanks Phogg :)
[23:59:08] <rustytaco> "oh my phone runs linux" No.. your phone runs a terribly bastardized linux kernel with a garbage truck dumped on top of it :)
[23:59:30] <Wafficus> I wish it were easier to get a rooted phone though, if anything for Okta verification
[23:59:52] <phogg> rustytaco: it's not as good as e.g. the stuff Nokia was putting out before they committed suicide, but it sure beats the alternatives (iOS, Windows for phones...)
