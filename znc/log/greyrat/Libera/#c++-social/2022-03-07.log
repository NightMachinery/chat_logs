[00:00:25] <MaNI> would probably help, problem with this left/right thing is people see it as sports, where you pick a side and stay loyal, and then just look up on the official sheet for your team what to think about anything instead of actually thinking for yourself
[00:01:07] <jotham> yeah i agree
[00:02:53] <MaNI> thats how you end up (on the right) with a bunch of anti communists who want to suck putins knob and somehow can't even see the irony of their position
[00:03:10] <MaNI> and on the left with some equally absurd stuff, but I won't go into that because the channels sensitive about it ;)

[11:37:01] <ERROH> people opposing in russia are crazy
[11:37:42] <ERROH> first of all, they had to somehow learn about the real situation, which is not easy
[11:38:07] <ERROH> then, appearing on that video is possibly a good way to have your life made very hard
[11:38:32] <ERROH> and it's like 0.01% of population that took to the streets
[11:39:39] <T`aZ> the world need more brave people
[11:40:17] <T`aZ> needs*
[11:40:18] <ERROH> and then you have people like carbonflux (intentionally lowercase) who suck putlers cock while enjoying comfort of his home 
[11:42:07] <jotham> yeah they are hardcore aye
[11:42:36] <jotham> being hoovered up by russian police for being a dissident is no joke
[11:46:35] <ent58> Given that Russia is acting rationally (debatable), what's the goal? Economy is tanked, world distrust, even your allies frown upon the action itself. What's the play? Did he just want to create a cheap buy-in to assets? Could it be something that simple?
[11:50:05] <ERROH> if you want to find such answers on irc you've already lost
[11:50:16] <ent58> Heh
[11:50:30] <ERROH> but ask carbonflux, he has the closest ties to russia here
[11:50:53] <MaNI> well if we were to assume that everything they say is true (its not) then I guess a massive nazi empire was growing on their borders and needed to be stopped at all costs
[11:51:32] <ent58> Yeah none of that should even pass the sniff test
[11:51:51] <ent58> But I just...I don't understand the inhumanity
[11:52:03] <ent58> What _exactly_ did he expect to accomplish
[11:52:11] <ent58> is it REALLY just "I want the USSR back"
[11:52:14] <MaNI> ent58, in terms of rationality, in their minds this was over in 2 days, without the negative repercussions that are now in place due to it taking longer
[11:52:29] <jotham> unify kievan rus, as is his holy duty
[11:52:40] <MaNI> sweep in, install puppet government, move back out "see we were the good guys, we never wanted to occupy just remove nazi regime"
[11:53:27] <MaNI> this is likely what they were going for, as best I can tell, having reverse engineered this mostly from what the crazy pro russian people are going on about ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[11:55:29] <ERROH> that is all good reasons
[11:55:35] <ent58> But assuming everyone around him has their head on straight, why would they not stop him?
[11:55:45] <ERROH> deep down i think putler just got afraid of power struggle
[11:55:56] <ERROH> he had no retirement plan
[11:56:01] <jotham> kill or be killed, right
[11:56:20] <ent58> So if he's going out with a bang, irrationally, with no guard rails
[11:56:38] <ERROH> he's not going out
[11:56:46] <ERROH> his plan wasn't to go out
[11:57:07] <ent58> All it would take is one actual Russian patriot
[11:57:15] <ent58> to stop this
[11:57:16] <ERROH> it all went to shit alright, but the initial plan was to show how fat his dick is so that everyone stayed in line
[11:57:32] <ERROH> you need to watch some russian tv
[11:57:40] <MaNI> well how far below him do you need to go before you find people who maybe didn't buy into the idea that the invasion would be a quick success? you'd be surprised at how infectious hubris is, couple that with a culture that punishes people who speak out about problems instead of rewards them, and well...
[11:57:44] <ERROH> or read some books on totalitarism
[11:57:55] <ent58> honestly sounds like a good idea erroh
[11:58:15] <ent58> Yeah, maybe I just don't get it. It seems so irredeemably stupid
[11:58:17] <MaNI> we already saw this elsewhere (in their space program) where they run into all sorts of absurd problems that should never happen, but do, because people are not willing to risk speaking out about glaring defects before launch
[11:58:18] <ERROH> his surrounding is meticilously crafted so that there are no people like you describe around him
[12:00:41] <ent58> So he's surrounded by yes-men, all with the same stupidity
[12:01:36] <MaNI> government in a nutshell yes, but especially even more so in dictatorship style countries
[12:02:25] <ERROH> i wouldn't blame democracy
[12:02:41] <ERROH> even corrupted democracies at times remove some rot
[12:02:46] <ERROH> look at shoigu
[12:02:59] <ERROH> he's been a minister since like yeltzin
[12:03:47] <ERROH> the only reasons he's still relevant is because he's tuvan (russians wouldn't ever accept a tuvan as a supreme leader) and because he's always made sure never to annoy anyone
[12:04:23] <ERROH> he has no other qualities and is a co author of the blitzkrieg we're observing
[12:04:35] <ERROH> any democracy would've removed him 20 years ago
[12:05:46] *** Joins: TCZ (~tcz@91.150.178.124)
[12:08:26] <MaNI> I did say dictatorship not democracy, there are various countries in the world that have some appearances of democracy but are actually completely captured by "gangsters" or "thugs" or whatever and are realistically more like a dictatorship. 
[12:09:19] <MaNI> Russia being one, Its a bit of a sliding scale, za is also one for instance, but we at least change leaders periodically unlike russia, although the leaders are always chosen by the same group of thugs, still its a bit more of a democracy apperance at least
[12:10:32] <MaNI> anyway all government does have the yes man effect (e.g. https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/10/03/andrew-yang-book-excerpt-campaigning-514967) but the effect is a lot worse the further along the fake-democracy/dictatorship scale you slide
[12:12:09] <MaNI> you can get a pretty good list of which countries are gangster states by looking at who refused to vote against russia in the recent UN thing

[12:22:50] <ERROH> i feel that that list is more complex
[12:23:08] <ERROH> i hate it, but i don't think it is as simple as "we like dictators too"
[12:28:28] <MaNI> its not necessarilly a 1:1 mapping, but theres a large overlap
[12:30:15] <MaNI> e.g. za is on there because we have a corrupt gangster organisation for a government, all of whom regularly go to russia for mysterious "medical examinations" (which should I think just be read as - list free organ transplants, they're all obese and wouldn't qualify for one elsewhere), also russia helps prop their leadership up
[12:31:05] <ent58> Just to make sure my brain is working
[12:31:12] <MaNI> most of these sorts of governments tend to be interdependant on one another to prop each other up and lend each other legitimacy, and will therefore see anything that threatens russia as a threat to themselves
[12:31:28] <ERROH> jesus
[12:31:30] <ent58> is that ISO ZA meaning South Africa
[12:31:35] <MaNI> correct
[12:31:39] <ent58> okay
[12:31:46] <ERROH> is that for zair?
[12:32:22] <MaNI> sa is saudia rabia so we revert to our french name for country code
[12:32:51] <MaNI> sorry, dutch
[12:32:58] <MaNI> zuid-afrika
[12:32:58] <ent58> Is the gangsterism mostly out of pure desire for power (to be able to affect change/be the king) or power as-in money
[12:33:19] <MaNI> is there a difference? they're ultimately the same thing
[12:33:26] <ent58> I think there is a difference
[12:33:31] <ent58> one you can hope to fix
[12:33:51] <MaNI> well, both really
[12:34:01] <ent58> Unless there's a form of government that is pareto improvable over time under constant threat of corruption
[12:34:13] <ent58> which democracy kinda does in fits and starts
[12:34:45] <ent58> My thought is to focus on the whole idea behind power-as-money
[12:34:52] <ent58> pull the rug
[12:35:37] <MaNI> so we might be seeing that happen here, they fell below 50% in the last elections, despite having a grip on power going back 30 years now, and abusing that in every way possible to reduce their chances of losing, so its conceivable that democrac may purge us of them
[12:36:34] <MaNI> on the other hand they've been working all that time (and succeeding to various degrees) in undermining various institutions like the courts, so its an open question whether they ever actually leave or we just deteriorate into something more blatantly corrupt
[12:36:49] <MaNI> its an ongoing battle
[12:37:19] <MaNI> so democracy *can* fix this, even in a quite bad situation, but its certainly not guaranteed to fix this
[12:37:56] <ent58> Right, and still, even under that democracy, it requires that the people understand the problem and vote to fix it
[12:38:12] <ent58> but that also relies on the choices being accurate
[12:38:20] <MaNI> we see this in our neighbouring country zimbabe where their putin like "democratic" dictator was voted out (despite rigging elections) and refused to accept the result, and instead of helping him on his way out countries like south africa basically aided him to remain in power
[12:38:35] <ent58> :/  ah
[12:39:01] <MaNI> this is the sort of thing I'm talking about when I say these bad states prop one another up, and what makes removing them so hard, and why fixing africa in particular is very difficult (because we have a higher than average amount of such states)
[12:39:47] <MaNI> the more of them there are the harder it is, because the citizens of a country in a democracy are limited to working within their own country while the "bad guys" can assist one another across boders via these sorts of mechanisms
[12:50:23] <ent58> How do we solve the problem of positions of leadership being magnets to those least qualified to wield leadership responsibly?
[12:50:58] <ent58> It makes me believe that some sort of random selection might produce a better government on average
[12:52:03] <ent58> The problem is that it can work beautifully or fail very quickly if there are no guardrails
[12:53:31] <ent58> What gives me even less confidence in that is that where I'm from (US), we seem to like re-arranging or striking down entire laws of established guardrails on civil rights, education, etc (mostly at the state level)
[12:53:46] <ent58> and it's powered by an army or regular people who think this is a good idea
[12:53:49] <ent58> of*
[13:00:26] <MaNI> yeah, fixing the world is tricky and above my paygrade, I can barely fix my code
[13:05:26] <jotham> agreed

[14:21:38] <T`aZ> sad
[14:31:23] <Carbonflux> what i keep wondering is, will the heroic technologists at Nvidia be forced to give into the demands of the greedy crypto-terrorists or will the dedicated free computing activists be crushed under the heavy boot of money printing chip barons?
[14:33:21] <Carbonflux> https://blog.malwarebytes.com/ransomware/2022/03/nvidia-the-ransomware-breach-with-some-plot-twists/
[14:36:17] <Carbonflux> interesting moral case study.
[14:37:04] <MaNI> strange way of framing it, given that part of the demands is to finally open source their crappy drivers
[14:38:58] <Carbonflux> releasing the driver sources of course does not make them open source.
[14:39:14] <Carbonflux> i don't see how the demand is practical in the long run.
[14:40:03] <Carbonflux> they seem to be claiming they have data on the firmware and the hardware as well.
[14:40:42] <Carbonflux> if they release all that into the public domain no one will really be able to use it other than individuals.
[14:40:51] <T`aZ> indeed
[14:41:00] <T`aZ> same with part of the windows kernel that leaked some years ago
[14:41:14] <T`aZ> you cannot use it i practice
[14:41:17] <T`aZ> in*
[14:41:41] <Carbonflux> so, Nvidia will just ignore it?
[14:42:22] <T`aZ> no clue
[14:42:53] <MaNI> you can't say that you use it, that doesn't mean you can't sneakily use it to make your reverse engineering a bit easier 
[14:43:02] <Carbonflux> i think if it was up to me I would just ignore it.
[14:43:04] <Carbonflux> true
[14:43:19] <MaNI> nvidia certainly doesn't want that info out there
[14:43:19] <T`aZ> i would also ignore it
[14:43:33] <T`aZ> the amount of work required is so huge
[14:43:38] <jotham> whoa
[14:43:49] <jotham> carb haven't you been recalled to russia
[14:43:53] <T`aZ> that only competitors with lots of money might be interested, and that means it's only amd
[14:44:16] <Carbonflux> also the crypto miners might be able to use it to patch their own firmware, but if that is the case why make a public demand, better to release it into the underground.
[14:45:10] <MaNI> if they do nothing to stop the leak of actual hardware specs and firmware source etc. it definitely weakens their "we can't have proper linux drivers because of trade secrets" bs stance though
[14:45:24] <Carbonflux> true
[14:45:37] <Carbonflux> it makes me wonder if the hackers are bluffing tho
[14:45:51] <T`aZ> nobody cares if that excuses makes sense or not
[14:45:52] <MaNI> wish they would just die, they're such a shitturd of a company, maybe if they are gone a better company can enter the graphics space
[14:46:02] <Carbonflux> heh
[14:46:39] <T`aZ> people are, in practice, tied to what the chip maker is officialy providing
[14:46:54] <T`aZ> your nouveau driver is a joke, and it cannot be something else
[14:47:58] <Carbonflux> jotham, its always the practice of Russian agents to accuse people of being Russian agents so as to distract attention from the real Russian agents who accuse Russian agents of being Russian agents.
[14:48:15] <T`aZ> yo dawg
[14:48:23] <Carbonflux> :)
[14:48:34] <jotham> wow
[14:48:39] <jotham> ERROH: i'm a russian agent
[14:48:45] <jotham> ERROH: sorry to break this news to you
[14:48:50] <T`aZ> MaNI: im promoting intel in that regard ::
[14:48:52] <Carbonflux> heh
[14:48:52] <T`aZ> :/
[14:48:54] <jotham> ERROH: carb says it's true and didn't even mention crystals
[14:51:22] <MaNI> well they've failed as a cpu maker, may as well let them have a shot at redeeming themselves in the GPU market I guess, why not
[14:51:25] <Carbonflux> ya, part of the issue with drivers is maintenance. 
[14:53:12] <MaNI> hardware manufacturers have a terrible track record of maintaining their drivers, and also suck at making them to begin with, should be mandatory that other people be allowed to step in and manage that shit
[14:53:25] <Carbonflux> i still think Intel is playing the long game, they see the gpu as a sort term solution that will be replaced by general cpu arrays, ray tracing will become the enabling factor, its just taking a while.
[14:53:55] <T`aZ> MaNI: this is not possible, the amound of work is simply to big, it *must* come from the vendor
[14:55:36] <MaNI> sure they must provide it, but it must be open source so that anyone who wants too can fix or modify it
[14:55:48] <T`aZ> agreed
[14:56:53] <MaNI> not just GPUs either but all computer hardware, or most devices in general, the amount of times I've had otherwise okay hardware absolutely suck balls because hardware manufacturers don't know how to software is insane
[14:56:55] <Carbonflux> also, how many are really going to take the time to sort thru 11tb of data.
[14:57:47] <MaNI> like my robot vacuum, theres theoretically nothing wrong with it the hardware etc. is quality, but they can't software for shit and should be ashamed of themselves, I bet I could fix all the problems I have with it in a few hours
[14:58:47] <MaNI> worst part is most of them don't even gain anything by remaining in control of their shitty software, its not like theres some super uber trade secret hiding in there, unless being written by people who can't code for shit is a trade secret
[14:58:55] <T`aZ> s/hours/days/ but yes, letting the enduser fix bugs should be mandatory * (* for most of stuff)
[14:59:07] <MaNI> graphics cards are arguably a bit special in that regard, but its still not a good enough excuse to keep it closed
[14:59:31] <Carbonflux> i have a ASUS tablet like that, the HW is great but its stuck on Android 4.2 and i can't find a custom rom for it, I would need to build it myself.
[15:00:10] <MaNI> but you can't, because the shitturd closed source graphics drivers probably only run on kernel 1.2
[15:00:14] <Carbonflux> at least i have the option
[15:00:15] <MaNI> at least thats how it generally goes
[15:00:52] <T`aZ> with closed sources blobs compiled 10y ago
[15:01:20] <MaNI> against an already at the time 20 year old kernel (for inexplicable reasons)
[15:01:44] <T`aZ> if you are kind you might get the sources for those, but it has not been upstreamed, and relies on specific kernel version, with bugs everywhere
[15:01:44] <Carbonflux> i have seen efforts emerge to attack this from the hw side, open source graphics cards, etc, but they always fail.
[15:02:10] <jotham> sort of
[15:02:23] <jotham> the m1 foss is almost production ready
[15:04:17] <jotham> cheers me up the brits saved us from american x86
[15:04:19] <Carbonflux> i still think the idea of a gpu is broken, its too specialized and complex, i would rather have 4K x86 cores and focus on physically correct ray tracing.
[15:04:38] <jotham> or like
[15:04:41] <jotham> no x86
[15:04:51] <jotham> american lockin
[15:05:01] <Carbonflux> well, whatever, some standard instruction set.
[15:05:02] <jotham> even steve jobs knew it was bad
[15:05:07] <jotham> and he's a massive hysteriac
[15:05:40] <Carbonflux> i forget why x86 is so bad.
[15:05:45] <jotham> i think we're about to see a balkanization (difficult term) of technology
[15:05:52] <jotham> and we will see a bipolar world of tech
[15:06:06] <jotham> i will have car and a computer with a chines and american cpu

[15:06:16] <jotham> i think that's where we're headed
[15:06:36] <Carbonflux> why don't you make your own cpu if you're so smart?
[15:06:45] <jotham> that seems facile

[15:07:47] <T`aZ> ERROH: easy
[15:07:48] <jotham> it's Carbonflux's maiden name
[15:08:13] <ERROH> 1. ignoring the true complexities of an issue; superficial.  2. easily achieved; effortless.
[15:08:21] <ERROH> english language ladies and gentlemen 
[15:08:27] <Carbonflux> anyway, integrated circuits were transferred from UFO technology so they are not really "American."
[15:09:03] <ERROH> yesterday i was watching that show with aliens and that greek aliens guy
[15:09:10] <T`aZ> may i interject for a moment, what you are calling 'english language' is actually call french language
[15:09:16] <T`aZ> called*
[15:09:31] <Carbonflux> and German
[15:09:40] <ERROH> proving that civ in central america was not possible so ufos
[15:09:42] <Carbonflux> there is a lot of German in "English."
[15:10:00] <jotham> sure
[15:10:06] <jotham> and tons of fucking french and greek
[15:10:10] <Carbonflux> ya, the UFO people were flying around a lot before radar.
[15:10:15] <jotham> every bad word in english that is dumb and annoying
[15:10:16] <jotham> is french
[15:10:24] <jotham> but greek and german backs up a lot of it
[15:11:19] <Carbonflux> the first UFOs the US "shot down" were accidental, because of high powered radar testing.
[15:11:57] <Carbonflux> now they can block whole areas of the earth using HAARP.
[15:12:19] <Carbonflux> well, mostly block.
[15:12:28] <jotham> lol
[15:12:37] <jotham> haarp came up heaps during our covid protests
[15:13:05] <Carbonflux> its a general tool with a lot of uses.
[15:14:13] <Carbonflux> you can use it to detect nukes from space, jam signals, disrupt the drive systems of some UFOs and imbed various signals into it. Its also the main cause of climate change.
[15:14:50] <Carbonflux> fucking with the ionosphere at that level is pure madness.
[15:15:07] <Carbonflux> but they do it anyway.
[15:17:19] <T`aZ> im waiting for will smith to disrupt those aliens
[15:17:27] <Carbonflux> ya
[15:17:43] <ERROH> that's the carbonflux i remember from before rubles corrupted him
[15:18:40] <ERROH> useless stream of deepack chopra pseudo i don't even know what based on nothing infused with bullshit
[15:19:04] <T`aZ> at least it's entertaining, somewhat
[15:19:05] <Carbonflux> well, i always got a lot of my intel from listening to Putin's penis, it talks in its sleep you know.
[15:19:21] <ERROH> oh, and let's wait for any factual discussion you will hear how it all comes down to hidden energy levels of vacuum that we strained when we invented toilet paper
[15:19:43] <T`aZ> im supposed to make a small demo, in 10 mins, but the kernel is still crashing. Which me luck
[15:20:04] <ERROH> use your time wisely, share that on irc

[22:52:25] <jotham> kde is for people that wish they were running macos
[22:52:51] <jotham> i like gnomes various utilities sitting under i3
[22:53:10] <MaNI> pfft, I have macos, I only use it for code signing mac binaries and think both the UI and OS is utter shit
[22:53:16] <MaNI> so no I don't wish I were running it 
[22:53:19] <jotham> agreed
[22:53:22] <jotham> but you do love kde
[22:53:26] <jotham> which is a knockoff os osx
[22:53:30] <jotham> *of
[22:53:37] <MaNI> how? its more like windows tbh
[22:53:56] <jotham> well that's telling on yourself
[22:54:07] <MaNI> gnome is terrible in every objective way, even a terrible code base, it exists as a project to keep linux bad
[22:54:15] <MaNI> always has
[22:54:18] <jotham> the codebase for gnome is so bad
[22:54:27] <jotham> every time i write something for it i'm like what the fucking hell
[22:54:46] <MaNI> if more of the larger distros  had ditched gnome for kde a decade ago linux would be lgihtyears ahead already

[22:54:56] <jotham> naah
[22:55:07] <jotham> linux main problem is lack of a decent accelerated compositor
[22:55:11] <jotham> not gnome or kde
[22:55:30] <MaNI> fine, but gnome is its second biggest problem 
[22:56:21] <T`aZ> i think the whole sjw/woke/lets remove everything/ mentality, coming from $part of the US is the main root issue
[22:56:22] <MaNI> look at how much resources canonical wasted trying to get away from gnome, which was also stupid, they clearly brought into the anti kde propaganda or they could have just used that
[22:57:06] <jotham> haha
[22:57:21] <jotham> T`aZ thinks a cultural fashion for teenagers is affecting the ability to write a compositor
[22:57:29] <jotham> best programmer i know is a woke fuckwit
[22:57:30] <T`aZ> it is
[22:58:00] <T`aZ> writing good software is *all* about mentality, not low level/algorithm skills
[22:58:18] <jotham> MaNI: that whole timeline with canonical was very bad
[22:58:34] <MaNI> yep
[22:58:39] <MaNI> such a waste
[22:59:04] <jotham> my linux usage can be summed up as slackware->debian->ubuntu and i faltered a lot around debian 16 to 19~ because it went so badly
[22:59:25] <jotham> i've used other distros a lot but i mean in terms of main faith
[22:59:39] <jotham> this machine has popos on it, which is a shit show but has been interesting
[22:59:58] <jotham> and arch is eternally useful but not for my day job
[23:00:19] <jotham> er ubuntu 16-19~
[23:00:30] <jotham> that's when they experimented with ditching gnome
[23:00:35] <jotham> and everything went to shit
[23:01:00] <jotham> but i mostly use i3 as my window manager, so i don't see lots of the gnome/kde disasters
[23:01:25] <jotham> still would quite like proper hardware accelerated vsynced monitor driving though
[23:01:40] <jotham> osx and windows do it fine
[23:01:42] <jotham> linux is a shitshow
