[15:56:27] <flatcap> it's a bit chaotic these days (it used to be more organised)
[15:56:49] <laumann> ok, anything I could help with?
[15:58:24] <flatcap> I'd like to get my colour changes finished and committed (but I'm struggling to focus)
[15:58:44] <flatcap> thanks, let me think...
[16:02:02] <laumann> I'm here to help :-)
[16:04:45] <flatcap> how dirty would you like to get your hands? :-)
[16:05:21] <flatcap> are you a coder? -- there are plenty of upstream patches that'd be great to merge
[16:06:13] <laumann> I'm a pretty seasoned Rust programmer, and a semi-decent C programmer
[16:06:41] <flatcap> great, if you're up for it
[16:06:55] <laumann> it's pulling patches from mutt and integrating them in neomutt/
[16:06:56] <laumann> ?
[16:07:32] <flatcap> yes
[16:08:13] <flatcap> historically, it was simple.  now that our code base has diverged, it's a little trickier
[16:09:18] <laumann> sounds like a good intro to the codebase though...
[16:09:44] <flatcap> yeah.  here's a trivial one: https://github.com/neomutt/upstream-mutt/commit/04a7f1d9
[16:10:27] <flatcap> since we split from mutt, we've renamed a lot of things for the sake of uniformity
[16:10:37] <laumann> alright
[16:10:43] <flatcap> and moved files and functions around
[16:11:47] <flatcap> so feel free to ask *lots* of questions
[16:13:06] <flatcap> any small upstream patches in the last 6 months are fair game
[16:16:35] <laumann> alright, i gotta go, I'll give it a shot later
[16:17:25] <flatcap> thanks, see you later
[16:17:28] <laumann> o/

[16:58:31] <gahr> hi all
[17:10:12] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[17:12:18] * gahr waves
[17:12:23] <gahr> how's it going?
[17:13:14] <flatcap> good thanks...
[17:13:25] <flatcap> busy breaking the enter_field() code :-)
[17:13:34] <flatcap> how are you?
[17:14:10] <flatcap> s/breaking/refactoring/
[17:14:21] <gahr> I saw the commits :)
[17:14:34] <gahr> me, I'm good, busy wrapping things up before I take time off
[17:16:19] <flatcap> :-)
[17:20:13] <flatcap> I've been trying to work out how to disentagle enter_field() from auto-completion (which frequently opens a new dialog)
[17:20:48] <flatcap> what is essentially a simple piece of code has dependencies on almost everything!
[17:20:50] <flatcap> https://flatcap.org/mutt/enter/g3-expanded.svg
[17:21:13] <gahr> hehe
[17:23:21] <flatcap> I'm looking at a standard interface for all of them, then pass in the function from way over on the left
[17:39:59] <gahr> are you looking at an iterator?
[17:40:05] <gahr> get me the next element, etc?
[17:44:16] <flatcap> I haven't got that far in my thinking
[17:45:50] <flatcap> yeah, an iterator sounds ideal
[17:56:38] <gahr> I once wrote an auto-completion iterator for an X11 launcher: https://github.com/gahr/thingylaunch/blob/master/completion.h
[17:57:11] <gahr> I don't know what I was thinking back then, opening braces on the same line :/

[18:38:40] * laumann will try to stay quiet about preferring the linux C style...
[18:42:27] <flatcap> we had a big debate about it in the early days.  we chose to match upstream Mutt's style for simplicity
[18:43:41] <flatcap> clang-format means everything is, at least, consistent
[18:44:03] <laumann> +1
[18:48:17] <laumann> why change if it aint broken

[20:19:12] <laumann> github says I'm not a member of the gentoo users team :-(
[20:21:01] <flatcap> oh, sorry. I ticked the box, and went away, but github asked me for confirmation
[20:21:13] <flatcap> done
[20:23:10] <laumann> thanks :-)
[20:23:20] <laumann> I think I found another bug...
[20:23:40] <laumann> also: I should be working off of master, right?
[20:24:40] <flatcap> yes
[20:24:53] <flatcap> what have you found?
[20:26:18] <laumann> when selecting a mailbox with 'c' and trying to select a folder with the arrow keys, every _other_ line is highlighted
[20:26:21] <laumann> but not the others
[20:26:32] <laumann> to the asciinemachine¡
[20:28:18] <flatcap> oh!
[20:28:57] <laumann> could be the coloring, but i'm trying to verify that
[20:29:06] <laumann> (running on the flatcap/colour branch still)
[20:29:20] * laumann tries with master
[20:30:09] <flatcap> I see it on the colour branch.  very strange
[20:30:40] <laumann> nice
[20:31:01] <laumann> yeah, it's the colour branch
[20:31:06] <flatcap> master seems ok
[20:31:11] <laumann> it is
[20:31:14] <flatcap> thanks, I'll have a look
[20:31:37] <laumann> just opened my first PR here \o/ can't wait to have it shot down :P
[20:32:16] <flatcap> woo!
[20:34:04] <flatcap> hmm... <ctrl-l> after each movement seems to fix the display, I must be clearing the old position, but not forcing a refresh after painting the new one
