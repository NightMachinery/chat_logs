[00:06:06] <mwnaylor> Ok. Seems like I ùòÆùò¢ùò∫ have gotten the naming issues resolved. Now the problem I have is lein can't find my artifact in clojars. That stops me from starting a lein repl, and as a result, no cider repl in emacs.
[00:07:22] <ridcully> have you adjusted the name?
[00:07:29] <mwnaylor> I want to bypass accessing the web for the artifact and just get it from my .m2 directory.
[00:07:35] <ridcully> you have to use the name in project.clj of the lib
[00:08:01] <ridcully> and if you have adjusted the project name in the lib, then don't forget to `lein install` again
[00:12:44] <mwnaylor> Neither the aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd nor the aaa.bbb.ccc/ddd variant work. In both cases, lein can't find the jar in Clojars and breaks.
[00:14:56] <mwnaylor> Once I got a good local push w/ lein install, I haven't touched the library project.
[00:17:25] <ridcully> i tried that locally and it wfm‚Ñ¢
[00:18:06] <ridcully> using the same naming (without the slash) because i wanted to see if the artifact/artifact is like i remembered

[00:40:14] <mwnaylor> I'm SOOO close. I got my lein repl, therefore the cider repl to load. lein can see my .m2 jar. Now, I can't get my ns declaration right. The :refer portion can't see the defn I want to pull in.

[00:45:55] <mwnaylor> The hint about looking at the pom.xml was a huge insight. It looks like I have been using lein the wrong way in cereating projects. I had been using com.gmail.<my gmail id>.<my project name>. I should have been using com.gmail.<my gmail id>/<my project name>. Using the form with no slash, the group id and artifact id were the same. Using the slash, the group id and artifact id were more like we would expect.
[00:47:42] <mwnaylor> Since I have my library project in git, and the naming and directory structure are hosed, I may have to clone it and do the painful manual rework to get it in the proper form.
[00:50:20] <ridcully> the two things have nothing to do in general
[00:50:55] <ridcully> the directory structure under src is just the namespaces _inside_ the jar you are deploying as group/artifact "version"
[01:09:49] *** Joins: selfsymmetric-mu (~matt@c-73-10-148-139.hsd1.nj.comcast.net)
[01:11:06] <mwnaylor> ridcully: directory structure seems to be similar. But, pom.xml w/ group and artifact ids differ. In a temp directory, In a disposable directory, run org.ridcully.test-prj and org.ridcully/test-prj. If you do lein uberjar in each, then dive into the jar files, I think you'll see a difference in the artifactId.
[01:14:26] <ridcully> the uberjar is just all jars squished together - so _if_ pom/maven stuff ends up there it will differ... but it has no relevance.  it's very unlikely anything will look for the maven stuff inside an uberjar (it is an artifact to be deployed/run - not to be distributed)
[01:18:15] <ridcully> or did you mean when you do a lein new, that the default namespace structure differs?  well that is true, but it does not really matter
[01:19:40] <ridcully> those are just default.  it makes sense to stick with the defaults so things align nicely, but it does not have to be like this.  if you create a project like foo.bar.baz and then change the defproject to g/a it will work just fine.  the jar will contain the foo/bar/baz/core.clj and it will be deployed under g/a/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT or whatever
[01:37:17] <mwnaylor> ridcully: In a virgin directory, run both 'lein new com.gmail.my-name.my-project' and 'lein new com.gmail.my-name/my-project'. In each of new sub-directories, run lein uberjar. Examine the both sub-directories and the pom.xml in the generated jars. You will see a big difference.
[01:41:16] <mwnaylor> Many thanks to all following, more to responder, for my problem of using lein to create and consume local only Clojure repositories/dependencies.  I don't have it nailed down perfectly, but you all have given me pointers for getting it correct.
[01:43:22] <ridcully> yes, in the meta data - and this to be expected
[01:44:55] <ridcully> but if you search in both jars for your my_project.clj you will find it in the same place
[01:45:21] <ridcully> the meta-inf is different because the defproject name is different
[02:04:24] <mwnaylor> Yes. I now see that defprojct name is the key. I was creating with com.gmail.my-name.my-project. I should have been using com.gmail.my-name/my-project. I think the first case makes a project with a groupId and no artifactId. w/o an artifactId, lein uses groupId as artifact

[21:14:42] <selfsymmetric-mu> I might throw up a GitHub repository that describes my strategy. 
[21:15:27] <selfsymmetric-mu> Most problems involve reading an input and computing some property efficiently. 
[21:15:42] <selfsymmetric-mu> So the spine of my solution is to have a recursive function with recur for tail-recursion-checking.
[21:16:12] <selfsymmetric-mu> The first parameter is the input being consumed (sometimes after some postprocessing), and the rest of the parameters are accumulators.
[21:16:57] <selfsymmetric-mu> (defn solve [input aux1 aux2 aux3 ...] (if base-case? solution (recur ...)))
[21:17:33] <selfsymmetric-mu> The accumulators are where you put your fancy data structures. So if you need a map or a min-heap or a queue or whatever to be fast, that's where they go.
[21:18:24] <selfsymmetric-mu> Now because of `recur` I don't need to worry about the stack anymore, and the strategy is reduced to finding the correct procedure and choosing the correct data structures.
