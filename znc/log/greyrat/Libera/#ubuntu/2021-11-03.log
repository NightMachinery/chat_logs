I get a correct response if I execute dig @192.168.0.1 google.com but I don't get anything when only executing dig google.com. I think this happened, after using Proton VPN last weekend. I already deinstalled all proton vpn packages. But it did not fix the problem. What else could I try?

[04:08:28] <Sven_vB> I'm looking for a video player for Ubuntu focal that can receive an MP4 stream on stdin, play it, and dump it to a file. the latter shall be independent of playback so the source is never blocked and the recording works even when I pause the playback or rewind. I'd also like playback at increased speed, which shall go back to normal speed when it reaches the point where stdin does not yet have new data.
[04:09:13] <Sven_vB> do we have such a player?

[09:26:39] <Tomatokiller> My last Apache config was all messed up. I finally got it secure. I'm still having issues with Wordpress loading up. Can someone tell me what shows up at: http://http://45.146.164.110 thanks.
[09:26:52] <Tomatokiller> I would be more than willing to pay somebody to help me as well.
[09:27:37] <Tomatokiller> I am new to IRC, I was told there would be a lot of people here who could help. I really want to make sure that I set up the security correctly.￼
[09:29:02] <Tomatokiller> Can anybody tell me if you guys can read what I'm typing? I hope I did my registration correctly.
[09:29:58] <alkisg> Tomatokiller: yes, your messages can be read properly
[09:30:34] <alkisg> The IP that you linked to has an apache "it works" page
[09:30:48] <Tomatokiller> alkisg: Thank you!

[09:33:25] <Tomatokiller> alkisg: I hope I did not get hacked again.￼
[09:33:35] <alkisg> Tomatokiller: well, it's not. Maybe you installed it in a subdir like "wordpress" or "wp", or maybe you didn't configure it properly...
[09:35:22] <Tomatokiller> alkisg: thank you, I will have to go double check. Somebody put a bunch of porn links in it jest before and installed wpterm to try to get root. I am starting over.
[09:35:56] <alkisg> Make sure you keep your server and your php apps up to date
[09:37:13] <Tomatokiller> alkisg: I had my permissions set incorrectly. It was all open for the taking. I have no clue what I'm doing. I'm being pushed by a cheap boss. I told him we should hire a real linux Admin.
[09:38:09] <Tomatokiller> Maybe it's better the server keeps getting attacked until the boss wakes up… It just hurts my feelings, because every time I think I figured it out, someone proves to me that I'm still an idiot.￼

[19:12:13] <Gallomimia> how can i possibly know what updates are coming in the new release of "linux-firmware" today? the packages.ubuntu website is not very forthcoming
[19:12:45] <Gallomimia> and a second question... when is such firmware getting installed? on reboot?
[19:13:20] *** Joins: KBar (~KBar@213.230.72.178)
[19:14:04] <Gallomimia> hm. this page shows a changelog, the latest of which is from 29 september. where's todays? http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/main/l/linux-firmware/linux-firmware_1.201/changelog
[19:14:49] <TJ-> Gallomimia:  firmware is loaded by the driver, which will usually be at boot-time unless the device is hot-plugged or removed and reinserted
[19:15:03] <Gallomimia>  thx
[19:15:12] <Gallomimia> still a great mystery which firmware is coming down the pipe
[19:15:22] <TJ-> Gallomimia: as to changes, "apt-get changelog <package-name>"
[19:15:23] <leftyfb> Gallomimia: are you having any hardware issues?
[19:15:27] <Gallomimia> no
[19:15:50] <Gallomimia> i would just rather keep some tabs on who and why someone is updating firmware in my system
[19:15:52] <leftyfb> Gallomimia: unless you're having hardware issues, I wouldn't worry too much about the linux-firmware package being updated
[19:16:28] <Gallomimia> good for you. i'm going to worry about it. at least ask questions
[19:16:33] <leftyfb> Gallomimia: to be clear, no firmware is being written to devices. This is firmware that is loaded realtime at boot by the driver. It's making no changes to your hardware
[19:17:03] <Gallomimia> "loaded" you mean into kernel memory?
[19:17:08] *** Quits: Nitrousoxide (~msdos@user/nitrousoxide) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[19:17:11] <leftyfb> correct
[19:17:12] <Gallomimia> then.... how is it firmware?
[19:17:40] *** Joins: rfm (~rfm@user/rfm)
[19:17:40] <leftyfb> Gallomimia: it's how the driver is interfacing with the hardware
[19:18:01] <Gallomimia> sounds to me like it's just an extension to said driver
[19:18:29] <TJ-> Gallomimia: a device driver in the kernel declares firmware files it may need to load into hardware devices. When the driver sees a device that needs firmware it asks userspace to pass it to the kernel, and the driver then writes it into the hardware
[19:19:15] <TJ-> Gallomimia: firmware is not code that can be executed on the host; it is usually the machine-code of the hardware device
[19:19:39] <Gallomimia> that's a lot of fuzzy answers sirs. if it's firmware, it writes to hardware. if it's software, it's part of a driver. if it's firmware, it's modifying my device. albeit should be of benefit, i simply want to keep track
[19:19:52] <leftyfb> Gallomimia: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Linux_firmware
[19:20:14] <TJ-> Gallomimia: in long-gone days such firmware was in ROM/EEPROM on the hardware but nowadays its loaded into SRAM of the device by the OS driver
[19:20:32] <KBar> i got a feeling this would be offtopic, but is it possible to disable menubars in all gtk apps altogether?

I deleted the local font, ran dpkg-reconfigure fontcache, cleared chrome's whole cache and restarted it. font-viewer and mate-font-viewer still show the font, but not where it is or how to delete it. font-manager doesn't show the font at all. The font is not in ~/.local/share/fonts, /usr/local/share/fonts, or

[22:41:24] <Gallomimia> i'm rather in the dark....... why do you need a tutorial at all to install ubuntu?
[22:41:25] <webchat69> Sarnold that I dont know.
[22:41:31] <sarnold> the defaults ought to be right for whatever your system currently is configured to do

[22:42:28] <Gallomimia> correct. there's no need to do a fancy partitioning setup
[22:42:42] <webchat69> Okay
[22:42:43] <Gallomimia> only if you want special partitioning setups do you need to do that

[22:45:19] <Gallomimia> the entire point of ubuntu, in fact the reason they chose the name ubuntu, is to make an alternative operating system that everyone can use easily. no need to muck about with special partitioning scheemes, or struggle with installing video card drivers, compiling them into the kernel. just work. automagically

[22:48:05] <Gallomimia> well, i'm hoping that once you get a plain jane install completed, you should be able to go into "Software & Updates" select the "Additional Drivers" tab, and it takes care of that for you too.
[22:48:09] <webchat69> Actually i wanted to setup a second monitor on the laptop. I connected the hdmi cable to the monitor and the laptop but on the laptop it didn't show any displays connected. On the second monitor it showed cable not connected.

[22:48:33] <webchat69> I did some Google ran some codes which i did not understand and got stuck with a blank screen twice.
[22:48:41] <webchat69> Now I'm installing a fresh copy again.
[22:48:48] <Gallomimia> so, next question. why are you using an extremely old version of the nvidia drivers? they're usually quite backward compatible
[22:49:14] <Gallomimia> the current version is 470
[22:49:54] *** Quits: p0indexter (~alpha@user/p0indexter) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[22:49:54] <webchat69> I see. But i think for my laptop the recommend drivers shown were 340. My laptop is old too. I think old gen i5.
[22:50:06] *** Quits: g4mby (~g4mby@user/g4mby) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[22:50:24] <webchat69> I thought the problem was with Nvidia drivers, that's why it didn't detect the second monitor connected to the hdmi port.
[22:51:11] <sarnold> there's a reasonable chance there's a button on your keyboard that you can hit to cycle between the built-in monitor, the external monitor, and both monitors
[22:52:41] <webchat69> Sir. Do not scare me. Theres a button on F4 which looks like a screen. Let me google what it is. But now i can't test it cuz im install ubuntu..

[22:53:01] <Gallomimia> that's correct too. but usually you ned to get nvidia drivers working in any event.
[22:53:06] <sarnold> maybe you just hit f4; maybe you have to hold down an fn key then press f4..

[22:53:24] <Gallomimia> no no don't do that!
[22:53:38] <Gallomimia> but i agree, you might have made this way more complicated than they need to be...
[22:54:15] <webchat69> Okay we are on the copying files screen.

[22:55:06] <Gallomimia> another problem with googling for answers is.... websites don't get updated with the correct information. ubuntu gets a new version every 6 months. you might be doing something for an older version without realizing.
[22:55:21] <webchat69> Most of the solutions were from 2018..
[22:55:50] <Gallomimia> would you care to share the model of laptop you're using? i'd like to know more about why the very old driver version. even my rather old graphics card benefits from the newest nvidia driver.
[22:56:15] <Gallomimia> when i started using this gpu, 340 was in beta

[23:47:04] <sarnold> Gallomimia: yeah, that's the stuff
[23:47:06] <Fatal_Sushi> peto: for a LTS on the Pi 4 you have to wait until Ubuntu 22.04 comes out

[23:48:18] <Gallomimia> darn that's kinda sad. have to wait for an LTS before deploying rpi4's in embedded machines?
[23:48:27] <sarnold> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FocalFossa/ReleaseNotes#Raspberry_Pi
[23:48:35] <sarnold> "Since the release of Ubuntu 19.10 Raspberry Pi 32-bit and 64-bit preinstalled images (renamed to raspi) support the Raspberry Pi 4 platform out-of-the-box. With this, our images now support almost all modern flavors of the Raspberry Pi family of devices (Pi 2B, Pi 3B, Pi 3A+, Pi 3B+, CM3, CM3+, Pi 4B). Starting from Ubuntu Server 20.04.2, support for the CM4 (all variants) and the Pi 400 has been added
[23:48:41] <sarnold> too. "

[23:49:12] <sarnold> sometimes the point releases of lts get newer hardware support
[23:50:50] <Gallomimia> sarnold, wow. is canadian?
[23:50:54] <ravage> And I dont think a LTS release makes much sense on a PI desktop system. There are so many changes to the drivers and general performance you don't want to miss for 5 years

[23:51:30] <ravage> 21.10 still has a lot of problems on my PI4
[23:51:53] <peto> @ravage what kind of problems?
[23:53:03] <ravage> Mostly crashes related to the graphics driver
[23:53:06] <sarnold> Gallomimia: no idea :)
[23:53:13] <ravage> Hardware acceleration is a big mess

[23:57:47] <waveform> ravage, hmmm -- try flipping it to the fkms overlay to see if that resolves things. If it does, you're likely running into that issue; a test kernel is in -proposed for the kms overlay, but fkms is a reliable workaround until that lands (which should be in a few days as verification is now done)
[23:58:36] <waveform> (fkms has its own issues, choppy sound output for one, but at least it avoids the "entire display freezing" pain)
[23:58:57] <ravage> waveform: i will boot it up again in my usual 4 week interval and see what has changed
