[00:57:39] <ggreer> what's the difference between a depressed cat and a... normal cat?
[00:57:47] <ggreer> cats just sit around and do cat stuff
[00:58:09] <gwern> oolong has many ways to make unhappiness known, so I assume a lot of it like that
[00:59:21] <ggreer> ah. speaking of which... since I'm buying a house I'll probably be buying a cat soon after. I hear maine coons are huge and fluffy and kinda nice as cats go. is there anything important I should know about that breed before pursuing that?
[00:59:50] <gwern> nothing much comes to mind. are you going to try to get siblings or at least a pair of kittens?
[01:00:33] <ggreer> why two cats?
[01:00:48] <rmmh> (implicit assertion that cats are happier in pairs)
[01:01:14] <shawwwn> had two cats. one hated the other. would not recommend
[01:01:26] <gwern> companionship, yes. if you get them as adults or late kittens, they'll never really bond

[01:02:42] <ggreer> I've seen it go both ways. one of my friends had two cats that would fight. one of my roommates had two cats and when he gave one to a friend, the gifted cat wailed all the time so he gave the second cat away too
[01:02:50] <ggreer> heh
[01:03:00] <Betawolf> siblings play together and comfort each other to a much greater degree, it's very different from getting two adult cats
[01:03:22] <rmmh> presumably you have to buy X-Large Cat Gear for maine coons. Can't get a standard robo litter box.

[01:03:39] <gwern> bonsai kitten, physically and mentally
[01:03:51] <Betawolf> oh, yeah, whoever you get the kitten from, try to make sure they're handling it a lot
[01:04:39] <gwern> at this point if I got another cat, I think I'd insist on getting a kitten so I could make sure I fed it all sorts of different foods, took it on drives, exposed it to a bunch of other humans and dogs, vacuumed around it, etc
[01:05:08] <gwern> (and also carry it around on a shoulder, I want a treecat! ;_;)
[01:05:55] <ggreer> that's a good idea
[01:05:59] <shawwwn> awe, gwern's getting a kitten today! that's so cute
[01:06:04] <shawwwn> what will you name them?
[01:06:17] <gwern> (I mean, no one thinks you can get a puppy and just completely neglect any kind of training and expect a satisfactory adult dog, but we do seem to think that we can just watch a kitten be cute and do nothing)

[01:10:59] <rmmh> Betawolf: 37% here https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-53904-w
[01:11:00] <gwern> is that a representative sample, or that classification a severe problem?

Despite this, little is known about FHD except that it is relatively common in the large breed Maine Coon. ‚Ä¶)
[01:12:12] <Betawolf> "The relatively smaller size and weight of cats frequently results in symptoms that are less pronounced" hmm, so not the same GSD-crippling condition maybe
[01:13:10] <rmmh> selective breeding looks real effective
[01:14:23] <rmmh> "This clearly suggests that FHD has a similar prevalence to canine HD (overall prevalence‚Äâ=‚Äâ15.6%; breed ranges 0‚Äì77%)5. These findings are in stark contrast to Hayes et al.20 who estimated FHD prevalence to be extremely low (at 1/180th the prevalence of canine HD, based on 14 cases in 270,000 hospital visits), but neglected to consider that many of these patients would have had FHD but
[01:14:25] <rmmh> were not evaluated for it because cats do not show the same obvious clinical symptoms as doggs"
[01:14:43] <rmmh> did they seriously estimate the occurence rate of a disease based on... the number of hospital visits that treated that disease?!
[01:16:36] <gwern> I think that lower number raises legitimate questions about "is this an actual problem or just some sort of bizarre esthetic preference about how x-rays should look"
[01:17:13] <gwern> I'm reminded of similar issues in, say, human x-rays and MRIs where doctors go "my goodness, this vertebrae looks very concerning! let's get you on that operating table ASAP"
[01:17:16] <Betawolf> Maybe just shows up as slightly decreased mobility/spring.
[01:17:16] <shawwwn> you know, selective breeding in humans seems like an interesting idea... I wonder if it's ever been tried before
[01:17:57] <gwern> (or how many "medically concerning" variants can be shown by autopsy to be perfectly normal human variation uncorrelated with any actual health problems)
[01:19:50] <rmmh> the hip score is probably a decent indication-- a score of 1 or 2 is unlikely to seriously impact the animal

[02:06:13] <gwern> [itchyjunk]: considering the extraordinary range of viruses, that might be quite difficult to answer. many viral diseases are probably still unknown
[02:06:38] <dTal> so, viral
[02:06:58] <shawwwn> ggreer: my dad and I used to use earplugs plus "mickey mouse ears"
[02:07:00] <[itchyjunk]> oh, hmm. i guess that's true! i guess there could be asymptomatic infections
[02:07:09] <[itchyjunk]> but i guess they wouldn't be disease in that case though..
[02:07:29] <ggreer> yeah but it's not purely additive. the soundwave travels through your flesh and vibrates your eardrum
[02:07:30] <rmmh> [itchyjunk]: by prevalence viral, by far
[02:07:56] <gwern> I think if you go by prevalence of symptoms/consequences, I'd go with viral. probably hepatitis and herpes alone outweigh all the bacterial ones like syphilis
[02:08:19] <[itchyjunk]> Hmm, viruses need (mostly, ignoring virophages) living organism yet there are so many viruses!

[02:20:25] *** Quits: galambo (galambo@user/galambo) (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
[02:20:28] <[itchyjunk]> I wonder if we could me mis attributing a disease to virus A when virus B is actually infecting virus A which is then infecting the target
[02:21:40] <gwern> you mean when the virophage is already in the human but latent and waiting for the giant virus to come by?
[02:22:01] <[itchyjunk]> right, but i was assuming maybe it doesn't always have to be giant
[02:22:11] <[itchyjunk]> or is that considered necessary?
[02:22:40] <rmmh> polio is only 7kbp. crazy.
[02:22:44] <gwern> I suppose that's possible but I hadn't heard of giant viruses infecting humans, and from a causal/medical point of view it's not really a big difference - the immediate proximate cause, in a counterfactual/manipulation sense, is 'a giant virus infected human cells and then bad things happened'

[02:23:18] <Robomot> Virophage - Wikipedia (Virophages are small, double-stranded DNA viral phages that require the co-infection of another virus. The co-infecting viruses are typically giant viruses. Virophages rely on the viral replication factory of the co-infecting giant virus for their own replication. One of the characteristics of virophages is that they have a parasitic relationship with the co-infecting virus. ‚Ä¶)
[02:23:57] <gwern> (yeah, all the giant viruses WP lists seem to infect small stuff like algae, nothing big like us)
[02:24:49] <gwern> [itchyjunk]: a better scenario would be regular viruses which have latent/active phases, like so many bacteriophages, and with the right triggers such as organismal stress, might decide it's time to liquidate and cut and run

[02:28:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Reading https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php/topic,4345.msg0.html#new ... first three anecdotes are all "... and now I have a PhD". Ok, but: (a) none of them say a PhD in *what*, and (b) this inclines me to discount the impressiveness of PhDs to some degree...
[02:28:29] <Robomot> Highlights From The Comments On Missing School: ... (Highlights From The Comments On Missing School: ...)
[02:30:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Another: <blah blah homeschooling success etc.> "This tells  me that smart kids don't get much at all from school." - no, you idiot, it tells you that smart kids don't get much at all from *shitty* schools, but if they went to a good school they'd learn much more than you are teaching them!
[02:30:28] <nshepperd> a PhD in credentialist free riding
[02:31:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I‚Äôm including Magus‚Äô story for the ‚Äú6-10 hours per week of instruction‚Äù comment, which is about 20% of what a normal student gets and should probably count as some of the way to unschooling. This seemed to be a popular theme among these kinds of comments, second only to the inevitable ‚Äú‚Ä¶and now I have a PhD‚Äù." ... yes, well, by that measure, my "delete all the humanities classes" plan would also count as halfway
[02:31:22] <Obormot\Arcturus>  to unschooling
[02:31:45] <gwern> more evidence for your plan also working!
[02:31:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course
[02:31:59] <nshepperd> maybe delete all the humanities PhDs as well
[02:32:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Good idea
[02:32:12] <nshepperd> for good measure
[02:33:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Another common theme was that I underestimate how bad missing school could be for poorer children. From David Roberts:
[02:33:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> > For the at risk kids, school closing is a disaster. Imagine a kid  living in a homeless shelter or a kid whose parents are terrible role  models or, worse, abusive, or a kid who doesn't have enough to eat. For  those kids, school may be their only oasis of normalcy. Without school,  they will at minimum suffer and might permanently lose a chance at a  decent life. This has little to do with test scores and everything to do 
[02:33:43] <Obormot\Arcturus>  with socialization and having adults in their lives who care." ... ok, well, first of all, who says that said adults *do* care, and secondly, boy this seems like a solution wildly out of match with the problem
[02:34:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> I haven't read the rest of this yet so maybe it's mentioned, but a comment of my own:
[02:35:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> How do you look at the last year and a half and go "yeah, most parents could totally teach their kids the required school curriculum if they wanted/needed to"
[02:36:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Isn't that one of the lessons of the pandemic? "Most parents are not even slightly capable of so much as *helping* their kids with what they're supposed to be learning"?
[02:36:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> And these homeschooling advocates want these parents to take over the instruction entirely!
[02:36:51] <kuudes> over here maximum study hours in school are 5x45min for 1-2 grades (age 6-8) and 7x45min for other grades
[02:37:03] <kuudes> per day
[02:38:05] <kuudes> minimum hours are on 1-2 20 h/week, 3: 22, 4: 24, 5-6: 25, 7-8: 29 and 9 30 h/week
[02:38:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I think there's a few places where missing school would have  outsize effects.  One is if the kid had some kind of treatable problem  (say ADHD) that the parents are not equipped to identify but that  possibly somebody at school might recommend taking the kid in for  testing.  Granted this could still be identified once the kid goes back  to school, but if you assume the parent will fail to notice it forever  but some
[02:38:36] <Obormot\Arcturus>  teacher/counselor/whoever *might* notice it, then less exposure  to the people who might notice will reduce the chance it ever gets  noticed.  For people who don't find this plausible, do not underestimate  the inability of many low income or rural parents to think in these  terms.  My sister was not diagnosed with ADHD until she was in late high  school and was prescribed Ritalin.  It was literally life changing for  her. 
[02:38:36] <Obormot\Arcturus>  It never occurred to my parents to think of her various behavioral  problems in terms of anything except childish defiance they could fix  with rules." ... weird take. Isn't ADHD *more* debilitating in a structured setting like school
[02:38:58] <rmmh> do schools actually screen for adhd? what?
[02:39:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> (no)
[02:39:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> I never heard of any school I was at screening for anything whatsoever
[02:39:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> I never even heard of the autism spectrum until I was like 24 or something
[02:39:53] <kuudes> do you get teaching assistance if you have adhd or something?
[02:40:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> And if *any* school in the city had an unusual concentration of ASDs...
[02:40:19] <rmmh> if you get a diagnosis of a learning disability the school is required to give you accomodations
[02:40:32] <rmmh> but that requires strong parental involvement
[02:40:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> No one I knew or heard of ever got any accommodations for any such thing
[02:40:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> This was just Not A Thing in my experience or awareness
[02:40:58] <rmmh> scheduling the doctor visits, doing them, filing out the paperwork, bugging your teachers when they ignore it, etc etc
[02:41:16] <rmmh> Obormot\Arcturus: teachers don't talk about IEPs for obvious reasons
[02:41:26] <rmmh> Individualized Education Program (IEP)
[02:41:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Teachers don't, kids would
[02:41:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nobody ever got individualized anything
[02:41:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> I didn't even get any accommodations for *literally not knowing how to speak English*
[02:41:52] <rmmh> and educational IEPs are unlikely at magnet schools where you have to pass ability tests to get in
[02:42:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Fair point
[02:42:09] <rmmh> they don't necessarily mean individualized instruction
[02:42:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> I know what they mean
[02:42:34] <rmmh> they could mean something like "you can't take points off for bad handwriting because child has cerebral damage impairing fine motor control"
[02:42:41] <kuudes> maybe usa should have better schools somehow?
[02:42:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm just saying I literally didn't hear anything about even this possibility or concept until well after I was out of school
[02:42:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: "somehow" lol
[02:43:00] <rmmh> Obormot\Arcturus: yeah, you need parents that *know* they exist *and* get them for their kids
[02:43:02] <rmmh> which is uh
[02:43:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yep
[02:43:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uh, indeed
[02:43:20] <rmmh> extremely unlikely for immigrants, and schools aren't going to *tell* parents about it because it's more work for them
[02:43:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Listen, I got an EA cause area for you: come to the U.S. and fix our shit for us :p
[02:43:49] <kuudes> :-(

[02:44:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guarantee it scores high on neglectedness
[02:44:04] <rmmh> kuudes: US schools are fundamentally broken because the establishment assumes that any gaps in achievement are purely a funding/teacher problem
[02:44:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Tell all your friends
[02:44:26] <rmmh> and can be corrected by adding more standardized testing
[02:44:34] <rmmh> because funding is expensive, testing is cheap
[02:44:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Funding doesn't solve the problems either, of course
[02:45:14] <rmmh> of course
[02:45:24] <rmmh> not much you can do for dumb kids with horrible families
[02:45:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> cf. Freddie deBoer's comments about how black kids in inner-city schools and so on actually get more per-pupil funds than their white suburban peers, etc.
[02:46:50] <rmmh> for background: I know more about IEPs than average because my mom has worked as a reading specialist in and out of schools for 20 years
[02:47:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> "One thing I gather from all of these comments, especially David‚Äôs, is the idea of school as being covert social services for poor children.
[02:47:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> It would be hard to openly have social services for poor children. Partly this is because Americans don‚Äôt like paying for anything that‚Äôs too openly a social service aimed at the poor, which means a lot of social service work gets picked up by other systems in roundabout inefficient ways.
[02:47:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> And partly it‚Äôs because a lot of the service being provided is  (taking David‚Äôs description seriously) something like ‚Äúyour home environment sucks, we are going to make you spend time with normal people in a normal environment in the hopes that some of it rubs off on you‚Äù. Framed that way, it sounds pretty offensive, kind of adjacent to ‚Äúyou are unqualified to raise this kid, so please turn them over to the governmen
[02:47:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> t‚Äù. If you openly asked parents in dysfunctional families to do this, they would probably revolt. But forcing _everybody_ get your social service, even the people from functional families who don‚Äôt need it, is a pretty neat trick for looking less sinister." ... I am reminded of all the (old) stories about how the *Army* used to provide this service for many poor/rural Americans once upon a time
[02:48:13] <rmmh> idk most people seem pretty happy with free food/childcare from schools
[02:48:35] <saturn2> i still believe all americans should be conscripted into the military for life
[02:48:37] <rmmh> they might ramble about govt brainwashing when the kids come home, but they'll never homeschool about it
[02:49:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> "But a few commenters thought that actually, Zoom school is worse than nothing on that front. For example, DasKlaus:" [blah blah, story about how poor kids don't have internet or time to do homework, etc., then counterpoint:]
[02:49:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> "And to make things even more complicated, here‚Äôs eccdogg:
[02:49:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> >    For some kids zoom school was better than in person as far as  learning.  I think that was definitely the case for my 11 year old.  In  regular school there are lots of disruptive kids that get in the way of  learning.  In zoom school those kids just completely checked out, which  was bad for them but actually good for my daughter because they were no  longer disruptive.  "
[02:49:04] <rmmh> saturn2:  we could have won afghanistan with 10x more troops
[02:49:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... and of course that just makes me think: but what if we removed the disruptive kids in general, as a matter of policy? eh??

[02:50:08] <rmmh> Obormot\Arcturus: they used to be able to do that and enough parents sued the schools because they were mad about having to mind their own hellions that it became impossible
[02:50:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nah, don't send 'em home, just keep them in a special jail area of the school or something
[02:50:29] <rmmh> you basically can't do any discipline of any sort, especially that removes them from the classroom

[02:50:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Exactly
[02:50:44] <saturn2> rmmh: sure, but the main benefit would be guaranteed food, shelter and medical care for everyone without any worries about how to pay for it
[02:51:01] <rmmh> teachers have zero tools for enforcing order other than illusory authority
[02:51:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, the real problem is that in any racially integrated school district this will have huge and obvious disparate impact
[02:51:48] <nshepperd> isn't conscripting all humans into the military basically communism
[02:51:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Optics-wise the consequence of permitting it would be just unimaginably horrible

[02:52:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2, nshepperd: Technically it's only optioned communism, so to speak. Conscript everyone, then send them all home like "ok carry on" but then you retain the option of being like "and now you go pick potatoes, comrade"

[02:53:38] <rmmh> to a suburb homogenous enough for you and then use 'reasonable' school districting policies to keep out most of the riffraff
[02:54:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> And they say identifying historical causes is hard. Pshaw!
[02:54:02] <rmmh> you'll still have disruptive kids, but if you're in a wealthy enough area you can be reasonably certain that nobody's going hungry
[02:56:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> In high school we of course had disruptive kids, by which I mean "kids with in retrospect obvious undiagnosed ADHD" (that no one ever screened for or identified, lol) but they were "disruptive" in the "too impatient to wait until they're called on for questions, occasionally given to heckling teacher if obvious bullshit is said or it's just funny"

[03:04:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> "During the pandemic a lot of kids sat at home bored out of their  minds, wasting away on their laptops, melting into twitter and facebook,  eating bonbons, and getting fat.  They missed badmouthing their  teachers and playing jokes on their friends, having tween relationships,  and playing sports.  No chess club, robotics, jazz band, or lacrosse.   Many parents saw their kids wasting away so they ponied up the big bucks  for

[03:05:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Finland is quickly becoming the global King of unusual hobbies and wacky sports‚Äì everything from air guitar championships to mobile phone throwing. But one emerging subculture that some are finding particularly confusing is the latest Finnish trend in hobby-horsing; using toy horse heads on sticks to imitate real equestrian events such as dressage and show jumping. It has become so popular that it is starting to spread to
[03:05:34] <Obormot\Arcturus>  other Nordic nations and even further afield. There are now an estimated 10,000 stick-horse enthusiasts in Finland, and the number is steadily rising." ... what the fuck.
[03:05:35] <rmmh> and jumping over things
[03:05:59] <rmmh> silly, but by God is it cheaper than real equestrian sports

[05:56:50] <feepbot> Germany before crossing into the West on tourist visas and applying for political asylum. They settled in Neuk√∂lln, a hardscrabble West Berlin neighborhood beneath the flight path of jets landing at Tempelhof Airport. ‚ÄúThey were allowed to stay, but they were not integrated into society,‚Äù says Benjamin Jendro, a spokesperson for the Berlin Police Union who has studied the

[17:50:22] <two2thehead> good
[17:50:23] <kiboneu> hey two2thehead
[17:50:57] <two2thehead> I'm rewarding myself for some deliberate practice, by relistening to _Friendship is Optimal_ on youtube
[17:51:09] <kiboneu> did you know that powerpc has a little endian mode that can be switched at runtime?
[17:51:25] <two2thehead> huh. No, I can't say I have
[17:52:19] <kiboneu> I thought it was a full endianness switch, but it turns out it only swaps the 1st 4 bytes and the 2nd 4 bytes whenever it stores it in memory
[17:52:34] <kiboneu> but internally it doesn't change endianness, i.e. registers are still BE
[17:52:49] <PapuaHardyNet> who is the manufacturer of your powerpc cpu btw
[17:52:58] <kiboneu> so what's expected then is that the memory controller or something on the motherboard to reverse all the byte lanes

[17:53:48] <two2thehead> Sorry if I don't reply, I'm just a bit tired and listening to this
[17:54:08] <kiboneu> so anyway, once the lanes are reversed, then the order of bytes stored in memory corresponds to LE while preserving addresses
[17:55:20] <kiboneu> 32 bit LE, this wouldn't work for 64 bit. strange? actually, it's because back in the day when freescale / motorola was competing against LE architectures, they wanted to retain the possibility of doing DMA with x86 daughtercards and video cards that expected LE
[17:58:02] <kiboneu> [a0 a1 a2 a3 b0 b1 b2 b3] - PPC switched to BE mode -> [b0 b1 b2 b3 a0 a1 a2 a3] -- Memory controller swap lanes --> [a3 a2 a1 a0 b3 b2 b1 b0] (this is what intel would see when accessing the same memory)
[17:58:48] <nshepperd> that's pretty weird

[20:06:11] <gwern> seems like early on, it's extremely unstable by design. even the slightest bit of difference in the noise might go off in totally different directions in the distribution, an ear vs an eye etc
[20:06:40] <RiversHaveWings> yeah
[20:06:47] <RiversHaveWings> so mb we can use higher guidance scales
[20:07:00] <RiversHaveWings> if we like... clip gradients somehow
[20:07:12] <RiversHaveWings> I bet the noisy classifier gradients aren't this unstable actually.

[22:59:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> And it gains even less from having crowds of assholes walking in front of said walls, filming them with their phones
[23:00:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> The music was nice I guess. All it really demonstrated was that if you set neat-looking colorful pictures to good music, it's... kinda cool? For like five minutes, not an hour
[23:00:28] <kiboneu> Obormot\Arcturus: i was actually considering it, thanks for reviewing
[23:00:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Especially if you have to spend that hour sitting on the floor (but they do give you a cheap little cushion! oh yay)
[23:00:33] <kiboneu> taking one for the team
[23:00:40] <PapuaHardyNet> you have a way of describing how plebian appreciation dilutes the value of art
[23:01:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Placing the gift shop directly athwart the exits from the space was pretty inspire, I have to give them that
[23:01:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> You literally cannot get out without walking through the entirety of said gift shop
[23:01:39] <shawwwn> PapuaHardyNet: Oh, by the way, I wanted to grant you TPU Admin access to my gcp project so that you can experiment with TPUs. What's your GCP email?
[23:01:49] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: annotations now have a 'tag' field which is a comma-separated list of strings; if a local file at 'docs/foo/bar.pdf', a default tag of 'foo' is added. tags are added to an annotation HTML inside a <span>, as links to '/docs/foo/index'. this is now displayed by popups as a link. so, the yakuza paper lives in /docs/economics/, and I have a '  - sociology' tag on it in...
[23:01:55] <gwern> ...custom.yaml because this is an 'economics' paper about the 'sociology' of crime/property-rights in Japan (I've added a 'japanese' tag but not yet synced that). now a user interested in economics or sociology can pop up the index of papers tagged 'economics' or 'sociology'
[23:02:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> And they got all sorts of crap there, too. Soap! I mean, really? Van Gogh themed soap? Was that necessary?
[23:02:19] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: depends. does it have antibiotics in it and do they sell bandages
[23:02:22] <kiboneu> i just see it as a means of getting normie-subsidized tickets
[23:02:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Ah cool cool
[23:02:52] <kiboneu> like the diners that have the entrance as basically a gift shop
[23:02:56] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: oh yeah, the gift shop trick is super common. has been for like decades
[23:03:11] <kiboneu> but it still sounds like a bit overpriced
[23:03:27] <kiboneu> the date-for-two options were real shit for 4x the price

[23:03:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> kiboneu: Yes, I did stop and think: where is the bulk of the revenue coming from? The tickets? Or the souvenirs? Or the branded designer dresses and so on? Or something else?
[23:03:35] <gwern> (it can be done well or poorly. some gift shops are cool and have lots of interesting and/or unique things in them. I always spend a lot of time in some smithsonian gift shops)
[23:03:37] <kiboneu> you get a bar of soap afterwards for an extra 100 bucks or something

[23:04:49] <kiboneu> not yet
[23:04:55] <kiboneu> checking it out
[23:05:00] <gwern> (I think places that don't do the gift-shop-as-exit trick tend to be ones that are old, poorly run, or have multiple logical exits or are too part of a cluster for it to really make sense. but places like theme parks which are tight as a dime will do it a lot)

[23:05:31] <kiboneu> gwern: yeah
[23:05:45] <kiboneu> Obormot\Arcturus: oh that's pretty sick
[23:06:04] <kiboneu> they should put a swimming pool there... actually after passing this thought through another cycle, nevermind
[23:06:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> It is SO cool
[23:06:28] <kiboneu> fucking a thanks
[23:06:28] <gwern> (it is manipulative, but can be done well and even done poorly tends to be price discrimination where richer visitors subsidize poorer, I expect, so probably a good thing on net compared to either things not penciling out or more severe forms of degrading experiences to raise revenue/cut costs)
[23:07:03] <PapuaHardyNet> oh hey shawwn.  really appreciate that. I'll DM you
[23:07:28] <kiboneu> (exactly. I hate the noise, but when i realize that i can ignore it and that its less noise than other forms of advertizing AND it makes my experience cheaper because some other people are buying shit... sure, whatever)

[23:09:35] <kiboneu> yeah no wonder nyc is so great for a manic episode
[23:10:11] * gwern reflects that $50 doesn't even seem all that absurd for such a thing in NYC, and since it's completely sold out, it clearly has a market and is underpricing itself even

[23:11:45] <kiboneu> ah, sampling bias
[23:11:53] <gwern> but I also wonder what sort of engineering goes into those glass panes. presumably you engineer them to survive something like 20 years of wear&tear and peak winds up to hurricane force? because how would you remove them in time for sudden hurricane swerving to NYC, much less randoa freak gust
[23:12:16] <gwern> (because you really don't want those giant glass slabs falling to the ground)

[23:40:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why not run less cursed browser setups...?
[23:40:04] <pompolic> i am also a bit leery about whether they actually provide the privacy guarantees they do

[23:40:11] <pompolic> path-dependent, stupid reasons
[23:40:13] <pompolic> I'm working on it
[23:41:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> erm, this might be a foolish question, but isn't the solution to that sort of thing as simple as "download Firefox; run Firefox"?
[23:42:32] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: haven't had a need to visit a GW URL again yet. next time I'm going to snapshot the localstorage, then click the 'invert' button, then snapshot it again, and then I can repeat the process if/when it recurs after that
[23:43:01] <pompolic> the particular cursed setup i am thinking of has firefox. old firefox. stuck in dependency hell with updating
[23:43:20] <pompolic> and i'd axe the whole thing but then i would not be getting work done for a while
[23:43:31] <mst> oh, yes, my office workstation is that sort of cursed
[23:43:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: ok thx
[23:43:54] <mst> if I try and run a non-potato firefox I end up with something that just displays the 'tab crash' graphic after half a second of loading anything

[23:44:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow
[23:44:31] <pompolic> on top of that, the new firefox UI is terrible. it has added up to me being reluctant to use centralized JS-heavy platforms, so i'd almost call it a plus
[23:44:50] <pompolic> training myself out of relying on webshit
[23:45:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> I do agree with that goal
[23:45:36] <pompolic> internalizing search costs has been a work in progress
[23:45:45] <pompolic> i think it will pay off on the long run, though
[23:47:02] <kiboneu> sorry but if the website doesn't render in lynx I AM OUT1
[23:47:07] <pompolic> basically
[23:47:19] <pompolic> shitty browsers as a webshit filter
[23:47:34] <pompolic> where "shitty" can stand for multiple things
[23:47:45] <pompolic> such as "does not do the browser feature creep"
[23:49:08] <pompolic> perhaps, and this is just me being hyperbolic, browsers themselves are a lost cause now

[23:54:14] <pompolic> something I've been thinking about every so often these days, is that it seems like you can pick any older era you'd call a "golden age"
[23:54:18] <Obormot\Gaia> There's a bit of a resurgence of it, in fact
[23:54:25] <pompolic> and it would have been a much smaller thing
[23:54:27] <saturn2> javascript is the scourge
[23:54:29] <kiboneu> yeah i know
[23:54:30] <pompolic> than what the internet is now
[23:54:50] <Obormot\Gaia> JavaScript is not the scourge...
[23:54:50] <kiboneu> i have stuff on gopher before devio.us went to endless "maintenance mode"
[23:54:54] <Obormot\Gaia> Ads are the scourge
[23:55:37] <Obormot\Gaia> kiboneu: You know about SDF?
[23:55:59] <pompolic> so you have something like, gopher might well have grown since its "golden age", but the lowest common denominator "web" having grown faster messes with that perception
