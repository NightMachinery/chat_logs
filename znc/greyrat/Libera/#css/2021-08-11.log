[04:35:55] <wirez> don't want it to fill 100% width :)
[04:36:17] <wirez> got a min/max width just need to center now

[04:40:51] <wirez> hm
[04:41:05] <wirez> last option of horizontal centering, the flex example doesn't show for me
[04:41:09] <wirez> first 2 do tho
[04:41:17] <wirez> that on my end?
[04:44:24] <oksushi> seems OK to me
[04:45:17] <oksushi> wirez: probably you just need to give the element margin: auto;

[04:47:54] <oksushi> I canâ€™t see your page, but that would be the simplest approach (assuming you arenâ€™t already using flex)

[05:01:39] <oksushi> `paste @ wirez
[05:01:39] <Selvvir> wirez, These live pastebins allow us to see what you're seeing http://jsfiddle.net/ â€¢ http://codepen.io/ â€¢ http://paste.asmcbain.net/ â€¢ Screenshots can't be inspected with website debugging tools

[05:02:24] <entuland> oh I haven't been on usenet for a decade now
[05:02:40] <entuland> more, last time was probably around 2006 or so
[05:02:45] <oksushi> I still have a google groups alert on aus.computers.mac, and get spam every few months
[05:02:57] <entuland> eheheh, yeah, it's become quite crappy
[05:03:18] <oksushi> conspiracy theorists, spammers, file sharers â€”Â not much else, Iâ€™m guessing
[05:03:35] <entuland> wouldn't surprise me, yep
[05:07:34] <wirez> with so many politicians being exposed as child rapists i'd prolly believe a conspiracy theorist over Official Sources[tm]
[05:25:02] <wirez> is it bad practice to change the font size for the whole page like 20% bigger?
[05:25:19] <wirez> i think font-size: 1.2rem; in html{} does it
[05:26:01] <wirez> i wanna make the text on this site bigger in general but not screw with anyone's accessibility stuff

[18:59:32] <FlorianBad> well since it's square it's equivalent to say: How can my child div be the size of the smallest among width and height of its container
[19:00:14] <FlorianBad> ah, and I forgot an important point: the container is a `display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;`
