It seems to just be going to the first instance of the keyword on the page rather than actually finding the definition. Does anyone know how to fix this?
[10:14:15] <mjlbach[m]> It's probably what the server is returning
[10:14:29] <mjlbach[m]> you can check the RPC logs by following `:help lsp-logging`
[10:14:31] <mjlbach[m]> s/lsp/lspconfig/
[10:14:50] <mjlbach[m]> but nothing we can do if that's what the server returns (except possibly recommend a better server)
[10:19:35] *** atlas is now known as jbox
[10:19:43] <SmashMineGameSma> I'm looking at the logs, what exactly should I be looking for here?
[10:22:11] <mjlbach[m]> you should see an rpc.send message that contains "method: textDocument/definition"
[10:22:13] <mjlbach[m]> roughly
[10:22:23] <mjlbach[m]> and then an rpc.receive that receives a Location
[10:22:36] <mjlbach[m]> Something of the form
[10:22:38] <mjlbach[m]> interface Location {
[10:22:38] <mjlbach[m]> 	uri: DocumentUri;
[10:22:38] <mjlbach[m]> 	range: Range;
[10:22:38] <mjlbach[m]> }
[10:22:44] <mjlbach[m]> All we can do is assume the above is correct
[10:23:06] <mjlbach[m]> (I guarantee you that the issue is the server in this case)
[10:23:30] <mjlbach[m]> (or intended behavior by the server)

[10:39:41] <mjlbach[m]> you'll see them in the log as well
[10:40:18] <mjlbach[m]> wipe the log, set the log level to debug, open the file, do the definition call, close the file, then copy/paste the log somewhere else and search for textDocument/definition
[10:40:23] <mjlbach[m]> (instead of trace)
[10:40:29] <mjlbach[m]> you should see and rpc send/receive pair
[10:40:54] <SmashMineGameSma> yeah I got it working.
[10:41:11] <SmashMineGameSma> it seems that I may have done the server installation incorrectly or attatched it incorrectly
[10:41:18] <SmashMineGameSma> in any case it's working now
[10:41:26] <mjlbach[m]> Oh, interesting

[11:18:03] <line> Hello guys, I am trying to install packer. I followed the instructions at https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim , However when i try to run :PackerCompile, it says E492: Not an editor command: PackerCompile, I am running mac os Big Sur, on apple m1, as my host. ???
[11:19:58] *** Joins: ublx (~ublx@user/ublx)
[11:20:16] <wbthomason[m]> @line: Probably best to discuss in the `packer` Gitter, but: do you have a call to `packer.startup` (or manually to `packer.make_commands()`, if you’re not using the `startup` style) somewhere in your config, that will be evaluated at runtime?
[11:35:02] <line> wbthomason[m]: Really grateful for the author to have replied himself. Yes, i have written bootstartup lines mentioned, and also require packer as mentioned in config. I have copied exactly the same. Also, i tried to run "nvim --headless -c ... -c 'PackerSync' command. That also returns the same .. Not an editor command: PackerSync.

[12:27:05] <mjlbach[m]> lol

[12:28:30] <dundargoc> The opposite, only macos support.
[12:28:31] <mjlbach[m]> so would be kinda awk to make something I can't use

[12:29:41] <kylo252[m]> I'm just trying the example config, and the components are working in "polling" -mode instead of updating once on BufEnter or something 😢

[12:37:54] <kylo252[m]> it's not just the lsp segment, every single component is doing the same thing

[17:36:54] <ndav1d[m]> bug?
[17:38:14] <bfredl> and the `...` args are exactly the same, or what?
[17:38:29] <ndav1d[m]> ehm yeah sorry laziness, they are the same yes
[17:39:04] <bfredl> hmm, could it be made double-width as a liguature? like space+the special char or the other way around?
[17:39:14] <ndav1d[m]> not sure
[17:39:43] <ndav1d[m]> not sure how that works
[17:40:29] <bfredl> not me either but it is something that the devicon font could do to get both variants as one codepoint
[17:40:35] <ndav1d[m]> apparently the only way I get the 2 width character is by doing `:lua print(require'nvim-web-devicons'.get_icon("foo","vim"))`
[17:40:57] <ndav1d[m]> if I save what's inside print in a variable and print that variable it doesn't happen
[17:41:11] <bfredl> and if you do `:lua print('x'..require'nvim-web-devicons'.get_icon("foo","vim")..'y')` ?
[17:41:17] <ndav1d[m]> s/doesn't/prints/, s/happen/it as a 1char width icon/

[17:41:43] <ndav1d[m]> 1char width

[17:42:21] <bfredl> ok, now you could try add a space before `y`
[17:42:33] <ndav1d[m]> 2 char width

[17:42:45] <ndav1d[m]> :o
[17:42:52] <bfredl> seems to be it. :)
[17:43:07] <ndav1d[m]> hmm so let me try to fix it on my code
[17:43:51] <ndav1d[m]> now it works!
[17:43:59] <ndav1d[m]> why does that happen though?
[17:44:56] <bfredl> logic in the font renderer in your terminal.
[17:45:25] <bfredl> fonts are allowed to define pairs (or even longer sequences) of chars that should be rendered together is special ways.
[17:46:10] <bfredl> originally it was meant for actual letters like ft or it or whatever but it turns out you could map any punctaion char or unicode char
[17:46:30] <ndav1d[m]> interesting
[17:46:46] <bfredl> so "!=" could be turned into ≠ (but wider) by the font
[17:46:57] <ndav1d[m]> stl looks much better now! :D

[17:47:07] <ndav1d[m]> bfredl: oh that
[17:50:43] <potamides> Is there a way to detect an abandoned completion in a 'CompleteDone' autocmd?

[20:34:24] <phaazon[m]> I’m having weird issues with LSP and diagnostics ☹️ it seems that restarting the LSP client doesn’t remove the diagnostics, and some are sticky for now reason with `rust-analyzer`

[22:55:46] <YorickPeterse[m]> Is there a way to see what diagnostics are cached by nvim? With rust-analyzer, every now and then I run into cases where stale diagnostics are seemingly kept around
[22:57:04] <mjlbach[m]> Even after saving?
[22:57:41] <mjlbach[m]> Unlike other servers RA doesn't publish diagnostics that frequently, but is guaranteed to do so after save since it runs cargo check
[22:59:09] <YorickPeterse[m]> Yeah
[22:59:25] <YorickPeterse[m]> specifically their check on save diagnostics tend to stick around sometimes
[22:59:43] <mjlbach[m]> Right
[22:59:54] <mjlbach[m]> They will stick around until the next diagnostic is published

[23:00:18] <YorickPeterse[m]> That's the thing though, that's not what's happening
[23:00:40] <YorickPeterse[m]> e.g. the case I keep running into is an error produced for line X after saving, I fix the error and save (and `cargo check` doesn't show it anymore), but for some reason nvim keeps showing it
[23:00:58] <YorickPeterse[m]> So I'm suspecting either rust-analyzer gets messed up internally, or nvim is caching things wrong
[23:02:14] <mjlbach[m]> nvim wipes the cache on each update
[23:02:24] <mjlbach[m]> The two ways to check
[23:02:31] <mjlbach[m]> phaazon: this applies to you too
[23:02:37] <mjlbach[m]> wipe ~/.cache/nvim/lsp.log
[23:02:49] <phaazon[m]> ah
[23:02:55] <mjlbach[m]> start neovim with the settings recomended in `:help lspconfig-logging`
[23:02:58] <mjlbach[m]> except s/trace/debug
[23:03:01] <phaazon[m]> should I rm `~/.cache/nvim` 😀
[23:03:08] <mjlbach[m]> no
[23:03:17] <mjlbach[m]> check the diagnostics in ~/.cache/nvim/lsp.log
[23:03:23] <mjlbach[m]> pre/post save
[23:03:28] <mjlbach[m]> then for internally
[23:03:38] <YorickPeterse[m]> `vim.diagnostic.reset` seems to clear them out, so this sounds like a caching thing
[23:04:15] <mjlbach[m]> You can add a function to diagnostic.lua that dumps out the diagnostic_cache with vim.inspect
[23:04:17] <mjlbach[m]> * the diagnostic_cache and prints with vim.inspect
[23:04:32] <mjlbach[m]> I would be extremely surprised if was a caching thing, because every update from RA should wipe the cache

[23:10:37] <YorickPeterse[m]> It's not just extmarks/decorations, as `vim.diagnostic.get` still includes the stale diagnostics
[23:11:13] <mjlbach[m]> My guess is 1
[23:11:28] <mjlbach[m]> that if there are no diagnostics it doesn't send a publishDiagnostics notification so we don't know to clear the cache
[23:11:45] <YorickPeterse[m]> 1. wouldn't explain why `vim.diagnostic.reset` followed by a write results in the expected behaviour
[23:12:03] <YorickPeterse[m]> And in my case my code has plenty of warnings, so it would be sending things (indeed new diagnostics are added)
[23:12:26] <mjlbach[m]> Got it
[23:12:26] <mjlbach[m]> I would check the rpc logs then
