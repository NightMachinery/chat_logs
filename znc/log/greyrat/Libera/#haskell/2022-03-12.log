[12:39:24] <euprogramista> hi there. could someone give me a hand to understand this idea from LYAH?  list like [1,2,3] can be viewed as a computation that can't decide on which result it wants to have, so it presents us with all of the possible results
[12:39:57] <euprogramista> the author mentions that a list is a non-deterministic value. this doesn't make sense to me
[12:40:16] <euprogramista> It also says: A value like 100 or "what" can be viewed as a deterministic computation
[12:40:24] <c_wraith> euprogramista: That is a way to view lists, but it's...  a bit weird
[12:40:39] <c_wraith> Like, sometimes it makes sense.
[12:40:44] <c_wraith> But it's hardly universal.
[12:40:45] <euprogramista> so it's not me that sees that it's weird?
[12:40:57] <c_wraith> Sometimes [1,2,3] is just 3 values.

[12:41:20] <c_wraith> But it is a way to conceptual what's going on with []'s monad instance.
[12:41:25] <c_wraith> *conceptualize
[12:42:08] <euprogramista> it gets even more weird when he says that "what" can be viewed as deterministic computation. "what" is a list of Char, so it should at least fall in the same idea of [1,2,3] to me
[12:43:17] <c_wraith> Like I said - you can look at it either way
[12:44:29] <c_wraith> But it's really only natural to think of it that way when you're looking at []'s monad instance from viewpoint that's sort of inside the model
[12:45:41] <c_wraith> Like, what's happening when you use `x <- foo :: [Int]' inside a do block?  well, x is getting a value.  What value?  Every value inside foo.
[12:45:52] <c_wraith> You can think of that as a type of non-determinism
[12:47:20] <c_wraith> but [] isn't especially *good* for that. It's ordered, which makes it impossible to use for any kind of infinite non-deterministic calculation

[15:18:25] <rembo10> I'm having a little trouble parsing vcards with megaparsec. A long line can be indented on the next line with a space, but that content can also start with a space... and I'm not really sure how to parse that case
[15:19:02] <rembo10> e.g. "this is a\r\n  long line" (with 2 spaces)
[15:19:39] <rembo10> It just ends up dropping both spaces

[18:41:00] <geekosaur> of course that doesn't work too well if you need to get at the other arguments as well; but by that point you may want to graduate to optparse-applicative or cmdargs or etc.
[18:42:12] <jackson99> it works well enough for simple cases. ie ["--option", arg]. but yes, for more complex things optparse-applicative is nicer, and you get --help for free

[18:54:21] <mreh> geekosaur: I was under the impressions that depdendent types were "working" in Haskell, with the right extensions
[18:55:02] <geekosaur> not yet
[18:55:08] <mreh> and yeah, I suppose Symbol is a kind really
[18:55:42] <geekosaur> possibly you could make that work with a forall sym -> … (in 9.2 at least) but I think all you can thyen do with sym is use it in a TypeApplication
[18:56:15] <geekosaur> this really is more an Idris kind of thing

[18:57:09] <mreh> I was watching Stefanie Weirich make type safe regular expressions in Haskell with dependent typing
[18:57:25] <mreh> Seems like there's a lot done
[18:59:27] <kuribas> mreh: "working".  What haskell has can at best emulate some of the behaviour of DT.  It definitely doesn't have DT.
[18:59:32] <geekosaur> I wonder if you want to look at the dependent-map package
[19:00:22] <mreh> but what's missing? It doesn't have pi types, but you can simulate them
[19:00:30] <geekosaur> and, definitely what kuribas said
[19:01:14] <kuribas> mreh: DT means that types are just normal values, and you can write function over them.
[19:01:46] <kuribas> mreh: in haskell, you need to use type families in order to write a function over a type.

[19:22:38] <Midjak> Hi anyone which is familiar with haskell LSP in Emacs. I tried servant tutorial and I am stuck with this issue https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/1559 . Any idea ?
[19:23:19] <Midjak> tried several hie.yaml configuration without succeed

[19:27:51] <Midjak> byorgey,  well I am not sure of the effect of this.  I have haskell installed with ghcup. Is there an impact on the installation to remove this ?
[19:28:14] <geekosaur> generally no; you should usually not be installing stuff in a way that would create that file
[19:28:25] <geekosaur> it's far more likely to make messes than to help

[19:30:53] <Midjak> ok it works
[19:31:00] <Midjak> Why ?
[19:31:12] <byorgey> I wish I knew.
[19:31:21] <Midjak> what is this folder ?
[19:31:32] <Midjak> :-) byorgey 
[19:31:41] <maerwald> Midjak: you installed stuff via `cabal install --lib`?
[19:31:56] <maerwald> that creates a global environment file that now all cabal invocations share
[19:32:17] <maerwald> that can severly mess with builds
[19:32:36] <byorgey> aha, TIL
[19:32:47] <Midjak> no I have just tried `stack new test-servant servant`
