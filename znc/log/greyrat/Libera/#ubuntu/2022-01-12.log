[02:49:00] <Gallomimia> actually, i think discord has a repeated crash problem
[02:50:18] <Gallomimia> i'm really rather upset that this machine has such poor performance with newer software. under ubuntu 18.04 i would routinely run games, browser, music player, chats... lots of stuff. and i had no swap file.

[02:52:33] <sarnold> Gallomimia: there's different columns, showing different statistics, one line per second

[02:52:59] <sarnold> Gallomimia: my favourite columns are 'si' and 'so', they show how much swap in and swap out traffic you've had in that previous second
[02:53:09] <Gallomimia> like i said, i used to live without a swap file at all. never worry about churn
[02:55:08] <Gallomimia> now. i recently downgraded from nvidia driver 470 to 450-server, because there was an insane memory leak and performance problem from failing to grab modeset ownership
[02:55:24] <Gallomimia> so.... maybe it's possible i could live without that swap file again?

[03:25:11] <shepherd_> Hi, having trouble getting getting my touchscreens to map properly. They have the same names in xinput, and the ID's do not stay the same after reboots. Consequently they must be remapped on almost every reboot. I tried to make a little script here ~ note: I'm not a programmer in anyway. Anyone have any ideas? https://pastebin.com/NPnSFazM if there was any human way to rename the touch devices that show
[03:25:17] <shepherd_> up in xinput that would be the real saviour

[10:46:26] <arkanoid> I've accepted and installed upgrades via gnome gui prompt a couple of hours ago, all went good and it asked me to reboot, so I did. Now I want to check the log of that operation as I'm having problems in compilation of a project, but /var/log/apt stuff seems not containing that

[10:50:46] <arkanoid> something really fishy is going on here. Ubuntu installed some software that is NOT present in logs
[10:52:59] <arkanoid> so /var/log/apt/* logs stops ~16 hours ago, but "stat /var/lib/apt/periodic/upgrade-stamp" correctly shows that an upgrade happened 2 hours ago

[15:08:42] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1926918 in glibc (Ubuntu) "cannot install libc6-dev, requires old libc6 version" [Undecided, In Progress]
[15:08:43] <Pricey> Please downgrade libc6 to the version in focal-updates. The one installed has been removed from -updates because it caused regressions and the new version superseding 2.31-0ubuntu9.3 is not yet released.
[15:08:45] <KBar> Pricey: ppas? subscribed to focal-proposed?
[15:08:56] <KBar> ah

[21:18:30] <ogra> MarvinTheMartian, the above will remove all snaps and snap support ... though note that you have to find replacemnts for the removed bits

[21:19:07] <ogra> the chromium deb installs the snap (and snap support)
[21:19:26] <MarvinTheMartian> and there is no way to block/blacklist snapd?
[21:19:43] <ogra> you could probably do something in apt ..
[21:19:53] <ogra> is there any particular reason wh you want that ?

[21:21:39] <MarvinTheMartian> I find multiple package managers to a be less then elegant solution, plus a few snaps ate 20 gigabytes. It's as if I'm using windows and battling winsxs all over again.
