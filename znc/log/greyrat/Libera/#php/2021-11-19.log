[00:34:10] <Rubin> I have run into some legacy code that uses classes only as a way to organize functions in non OOP code. that is, methods are used as FOO::some_method() everywhere.. is this considered a good practice in php, or no? any oppinions?
[00:34:36] <azazul> it is a terrible practice
[00:34:57] <azazul> and it was what bad php developer did, when php5.0 was "the new thing"
[00:35:19] <Rubin> i suspected as much :/
[00:35:34] <TinoDidriksen> So using classes as namespaces? Eh, not so bad, especially since autoloading can't load namespaces.
[00:35:53] <TinoDidriksen> So if one wants a bunch of functions autoloaded, that is the only way to do it.
[00:36:13] <Rubin> trust me they had never heard of autoloading
[00:36:15] <Rubin> heh
[00:36:49] <TinoDidriksen> Even so, it's not so bad in PHP.
[00:37:24] <TinoDidriksen> I'd fail it in a C++ code review, but PHP can't really do better.
[00:37:26] <azazul> TinoDidriksen: can you really think of a legitimate case for dynamically autoloading global functions instead of doing `require 'functions.php';` right below the include of composer's autoloader ?
[00:37:30] <Rubin> then inside some of these methods i see them accessing properties like self::$foo
[00:37:36] <azazul> TinoDidriksen: it IS bad php
[00:37:45] <Rubin> so i guess that is like a static var
[00:37:59] <TinoDidriksen> Static accessing self? Ok, now it's getting bad.

[00:38:39] <Rubin> alright thanks for your take. wish me luck ;)
[00:38:59] <azazul> Rubin: can you get paid for refactring that mess?
[00:39:53] <Sammitch> I'd wager that attempting to refactor a global/procedural mess like that would be the same as a rewrite.
[00:40:00] <Rubin> azazul, yep
[00:40:17] <Rubin> also, sammitch is pretty right on.

[00:42:03] <AnrDaemon> Rubin: That's not bad per se. It's just one way to run around inability to autoload functions.
[00:42:38] <azazul> if you need to autoload function, you are doing it wrong ... or in the wrong language
[00:43:10] <Rubin> there isnt any reason that I can see, in this code, not to instantiate the object.

[01:02:04] <mr_ab> Yeah if you are calling a class's functions all statically you aren't really doing object oriented programming instead you've used the class as a namespace and nothing else
[01:02:29] <mr_ab> Nicely (and something I wish other languages had), .. you can just _create a namespace_ in PHP without an object and load it with fn's
[01:03:04] <mr_ab> Actually, .. could you do that with php 5?
[01:03:13] <mr_ab> It seems like you could but I don't remember seeing it

[01:16:47] <Tach> Hello, is there a way to check if a IP subnet has overlap with anotherone in PHP ? I want to generate random subnets but I need to know if I have already such subnet or overlap in some other generated ones.
[01:17:32] <Sammitch> Tach: you know know how to translate IP addresses to numbers and how binary and bitmasks work?
[01:17:36] <mr_ab> yeah, I can't remember the exact way, but the general idea is to use ip2long() which makes an int (long) representation
[01:17:54] <mr_ab> maybe google "subnet overlap" "php" "ip2long" .. ought to get ya started
[01:18:24] <Tach> Sammitch yes I know that but the overlap concerns me, I don't see any way for that like a /29 can exit in anything below /29 exiting subnets, so then there is overlap
[01:18:50] <Tach> mr_ab yes that is one way indeed
[01:19:38] <Sammitch> yes, each smaller network is an even subdivision of the containing network and therefore cannot overlap
[01:21:45] <Rubin> > TBH, if I got my hands on such a code, my first order of a day would be: "go hunting for SQL injections"
[01:21:46] <Rubin> yeah, did that too. it was surprisingly ok, only found 2
[01:22:26] <mr_ab> tach .. i mean, what's the context? you could probably do it efficiently if you just start at one end, pick a size, generate, pick a 'gap', increment by that much, then again pick a size, .. repeat .. but they probably won't look very .. realistic .. but technically, they will be subnets
[01:23:21] <Sammitch> personally I like this widget https://www.davidc.net/sites/default/subnets/subnets.html
[01:23:52] <mr_ab> i assume you want like a list of of (random?) rfc1918 addresses and a mask?
[01:24:19] <Tach> Sammitch true but that is known what you have, I need to be able to "check" is there is a /24 or whatever subnet there is where the generated /29 or whatever fits in what exists is overlapping
[01:24:20] <Sammitch> also if someone tries to do "haha let's use 10.42/16 because 42 lol" in a professional setting, please beat them with a sack of doorknobs.

[04:46:37] <__adrian> if that's not what you meant, ok
[04:46:40] <GreyXor> it's you who told me, and I quote "It doesn't even parse regular URL's correctly" end of quote. so I ask you for a concrete example
[04:47:25] <__adrian> i assume by "correctly" AnrDaemon meant "it's not rfc compliant." similar to what i meant when i said it was naive.
[04:47:36] <GreyXor> ok
[04:47:50] *** Quits: entropy_ (~ent@user/entropy/x-9891564) (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[04:47:56] <__adrian> i.e., it doesn't check/care whether the thing you give it is a valid url.
[04:48:24] <AnrDaemon> It stretches the definition of a valid url as far as it could.
[04:48:30] <__adrian> it just looks for patterns. this might be fine for what you need, but you need to be aware that it's "working" within those caveats
[04:48:42] <AnrDaemon> ^ that
[04:48:51] <GreyXor> Thanks, i will  couple it with a regex validation or URL_FILTER to first validate it
[04:49:08] <__adrian> ^ if you know the thing you're giving it is a valid url, it will probably do what you need
[04:50:01] <AnrDaemon> Yup. In 99,9% cases.
[04:50:57] <GreyXor> I looked at the code of the function. I am surprised that it is not a regex that allows to get the elements

[05:12:53] <Blondie101010> Sammitch:  for fun I just checked and Cisco.com refers to it as a network ID
[05:13:56] <__adrian> i'd never heard "network id" before either ("network address"), but whatever, obvious what you meant
[05:14:00] <Blondie101010> but Google only finds that in 3 millions of sites, and seems to prefer network address
[05:15:32] <Blondie101010> reading a bit of context in the cisco doc page I have open, it seems likely that "network address" is used much more loosely
[05:15:45] <Blondie101010> so using "network ID" is more clear
[05:16:44] <Blondie101010> either way, I wouldn't have debated on which is better

[17:03:57] <joo-_> i know utf8 was also a thing back then but i was communicating with some iso crap system
[17:04:16] <Naktibalda> joo-_: don't use short tags, replace <? with <?php  or <? echo  with <?=
[17:04:21] <hans> kk, anyway what's the problem? i joined too late
[17:04:40] <joo-_> ah the problem is that the script says unexpected end of file so something must be "open"
[17:04:55] <Naktibalda> shorttags are probably disabled, so } in  line 85 has no effect
[17:04:58] <joo-_> i just wish there was an easy way, so i dont have to check every single paranthesis and every single quote
[17:05:13] <Naktibalda> View Source in browser and check if you see PHP code
[17:05:37] <joo-_> actually i dont have a webserver running for this, i only got the cli, but that should be the same
[17:06:00] <joo-_> maybe if i disable the output buffering it will show something
[17:06:26] <Naktibalda> just get rid of short tags in your code
[17:06:28] <joo-_> that didnt do anything
[17:06:55] <Naktibalda> start by changing <? to <?php in line 85
[17:07:00] <joo-_> yeah i am doing that,. it used to be a "thing" back then :-)
[17:07:02] <joo-_> i am changing them all

[17:52:17] <Naktibalda> it is very unusual to have both fpm and apache (mod_php) in use.
[17:52:54] *** Quits: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[17:53:41] <Naktibalda> you may need php-cli for running scripts or daemons - e.g. cronjob scripts or queue workers.
[17:54:29] <Naktibalda> also, when composer is used for installing dependencies, it is the best to have the same extensions enabled in CLI to avoid composer complaints about missing extensions.
[18:05:04] <brm_> yes Naktibalda usually i only use php-fpm which only load fpm config without php module for apache and do everything on fpm/php.ini (i hope thats already the definitive way)

[19:47:05] <olle> Or maybe it would help cohesion and coupling
[19:48:39] <__adrian> "purity" doesn't seem meaningful. "mocking" - ease of testing is a side benefit more than a direct goal. "moving effectful code" is what you're talking about _doing_, not a "why."
[19:49:04] <__adrian> why shouldn't business logic include effects?
[19:49:45] <__adrian> affecting somthing is pretty much the whole point of having business logic
[19:50:02] <olle> __adrian: I value testability extremely high. Maybe too high?
[19:51:22] <__adrian> you should value the code. testability is valuable, but it's a side effect of good code.
[19:51:38] <__adrian> maybe by "purity" you mean in the functional sense?
[19:52:24] <olle> I mean pure as in no side-effects, yes - no file/database access, no stdout/stderr output, etc
[19:52:56] <olle> There's no such thing as "good code" ;D
[19:53:12] <olle> Only good enough code ^^
[19:53:39] <__adrian> so "functional" doesn't mean "code that uses functions" but there's a reason functional code uses functions rather than objects.  ;)
[19:54:14] <__adrian> objects carry state, and with functional code, the state (if any) exists only in the arguments/returns.
[19:54:16] <azazul> "effectful classes shouldn't use composition"  < I will have to think on this for a bit ... or maybe a week
[19:55:08] <__adrian> you can make your OO code better by thinking about funnctional principles, but it's difficult (problematic, ime) to try to make strictly "pure functional" OOP.

[19:57:48] <__adrian> "I think FP and OOP suffer from same problems" i'm sure there's overlap, depending on what you mean. but that doesn't mean they work well if you try to make them follow all of each other's rules.

[20:05:45] <olle> Yes, that falls inside my "rule", since the data class has not both effectful dependency and state
[20:06:08] *** Joins: Chucky (~irc@user/pronhub)
[20:06:11] <azazul> at the end of that operation the $use might acquire ID value
[20:06:18] <__adrian> olle: what if  Entity { function store() { $this->mapper->store($this); } }  ?
[20:06:20] <azazul> *$user
[20:06:45] <olle> __adrian: Yes, that's outside the rule. :) More like ActiveRecord.
[20:07:05] <azazul> __adrian: then we ship you of fto the gullag because you are making data mapper to work as active record
[20:07:15] <__adrian> but the responsibilities are still distinct! it's just a convenience method!
[20:07:20] <__adrian> heheheh
[20:07:55] <olle> __adrian: You'll lower cohesion since $mapper property is only used in a small percentage of that class's method
[20:08:04] <azazul> olle: can you epxand on what you mean by "effectful change" ?
[20:08:05] <olle> If cohesion is important, I dunno
[20:08:29] <olle> azazul: Write/read to db, file, stdout
[20:08:35] <__adrian> i honestly don't worry about cohesion (in the metric sense)
[20:08:38] <__adrian> ok. what if the Mapper caches things?
[20:08:38] <olle> Some include div by zero and exceptions and random too
[20:08:44] <azazul> olle: effectful = persistence ?
[20:09:14] <__adrian> azazul: effectful = does something other than taking args → returning values
[20:09:30] <__adrian> so in the mapper example... i assume it would depend on implementation.
[20:09:33] <azazul> __adrian: it's not your term :P
[20:09:42] <olle> __adrian: If you wanna be anal about it, there's a difference between pure, total and referential transparent :|
[20:09:47] <olle> But doesn't matter much here
[20:10:04] <__adrian> does the mapper return the *same* entity with an id added, or a new one with the id and all the original properties?
[20:10:22] <azazul> ^ not how I write my mappers
[20:10:26] <olle> Ye, is it a `clone with` thingy? :)
[20:10:39] *** Joins: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky)
[20:10:58] <azazul> I do $mapper->fetch($user) ... not returning , just mapper populating the given instance
[20:11:16] <__adrian> so that's not a pure function. that's a side-effect.
[20:11:28] <Rockwood> __adrian, hi how are you sir?

[20:14:41] <azazul> *aiming
[20:15:17] <olle> azazul: no, side-effects can also be echo
[20:15:34] <olle> otherwise, yes, something like that :)
[20:16:05] <azazul> so, what if your data mapper need to do date-transformations?
[20:16:11] <azazul> *needs
[20:16:14] <__adrian> olle: are you counting internal state changes (as a result of interacting with other objects) as a side-effect?
[20:16:48] <azazul> I think by "effective" he means "permanent beyond current runtime"
[20:17:19] <olle> __adrian: good question :D
[20:17:55] <olle> $counter->inc(); <--- state change
[20:18:47] <__adrian> but no interaction
[20:19:00] <__adrian> no mutation of args, no return value.

[20:19:50] <olle> Maybe it's better to say, pure methods should be grouped together?
[20:19:58] <olle> Or, effectful methods should be contained?
[20:20:10] <__adrian> honestly, i'm just trying to poke as many holes as possible here because i still don't understand what problem you're trying to solve.
[20:20:31] <olle> Also note that it's very possible to do the same mixup in FP, with a record like {name : string; db : connection}
[20:20:33] <__adrian> we're talking a lot but i don't know why.

[20:21:51] <olle> azazul: It's a more general statement. SQL is only one type of effect.
[20:21:58] <olle> See link above :)
[20:22:07] <azazul> your persistence should be in data mappers
[20:22:37] <azazul> where persistence can be sql, files, cache, session or remote APIs
[20:22:41] <olle> Oh right, separation of concerns!
[20:23:04] <olle> It's one type of separation, applied to one type of concern :)
[20:23:56] <azazul> I would then phrase it as "persistence layer shopuld not have any application/business logic as a dependency"
