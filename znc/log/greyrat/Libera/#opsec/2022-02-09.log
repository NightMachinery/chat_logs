[12:16:29] <Joanna> I’m surprised that old phones don’t get refused by cellular service providers. It seems like something that they would do. Also I guess there really is no way to prevent being tracked by air tags except keeping full control of all of your things that could be used to track you. I bet there are undetectable trackers in the works for people who are above the law. As for ordinary stalkers , this sounds like an excellent pretext to 
[12:16:29] <Joanna> require identification of all computer users and equipment by the government. These sorts of laws  have prevented all car accidents after being enacted. Right?
[12:17:46] <Joanna> It would be great if big companies had to be responsible for problems caused by their products but that is not going to happen.

[17:04:06] <JimBuntu> Good morning Joanna .  Most carriers do have a form of limiting as far as activation, some don't have much though.  If your device doesn't have an MEID/IMSI, you might have trouble activating it.
[17:04:26] <JimBuntu> There is already a push to make computer outputs identifiable the way printer output is.
[17:05:30] <JimBuntu> Companies being responsible for the abuse of their products is a dangerous thing.  Knife, Axe manufacturers responsible because someone used their tools against a person?!  Buy a piece of wood and use it to club someone... doesn't seem like the timber yards fault to me.

[19:06:36] <Joanna> Hi JimBuntu: I think simplification is the answer. There are a lot of dangerous products that we would be better off without. In feudal japan if someone in a village committed a crime the entire village would be punished. I know That’s an extreme but it sure cut down on crime.  If knife manufacturers were responsible for stabbing people would be forced to craft their own knives an keep them away from criminals. In any case dangerous 
[19:06:36] <Joanna> products would no longer be mass produced and sold for profit.  I think it’s the irresponsible creation of things that are dangerous and are not really necessary that bothers me. On rare occasions dangerous products are stopped like lawn darts after children were killing eachother by accident. But usually like in the case of cars everyone is forced to either drive or be stranded and then blamed for the inevitable mistakes that 
[19:06:36] <Joanna> people make amplified by a large dangerous machine. Nobody is perfect. Anyone can make a mistake and kill someone.  It really is not fair to be forced into a situation of potentially being a murderer if you get distracted for a moment.
[19:15:04] <Joanna> People who need air tags to not misplace their belongings need to grow up and be responsible. There is also an old fashioned idea called a lost and found. To me tracking devices just seem like a way to help criminals commit crimes. Apple and other tracker makers should definitely be responsible for any crimes committed with their trackers. Computer makers should probably be responsible for making shoddy software that lets people be 
[19:15:04] <Joanna> hacked but that’s not going to happen.
[19:16:33] <jessicara> people make mistakes
[19:17:24] <jessicara> i would not be surprised if most software had serious bugs no one is aware of yet
[19:17:30] <Joanna> That’s right it’s inevitable so unnecessary use of dangerous things should be avoided.
[19:17:59] <jessicara> like even the 0day stockpiles certain groups try to make, probably not even scratching the surface of what is wrong
[19:19:39] <Joanna> There are always bugs in everything. Since it’s impossible for anything to be 100% bug free there should be a physical switch that has to be turned on to allow computer to be operated remotely if at all.
[19:20:04] <jessicara> physical switches to write to firmware at least
[19:20:41] <jessicara> is where the scariest of the to be compromised things can be
[19:21:01] <Joanna> The put back doors in there on purpose and then feign ignorance everytime they are found then put in new ones.
