[05:59:25] <isf> that is completly inmoral becouse is a restriction for have the control of your own computing.

[06:00:22] <isf> Noisytoot and fatal are trying to share the nonfree softwarE?
[06:00:32] <isf> that looks like opensource movement
[06:01:18] <isf> remember, you cant share the nonfree software, you cant becouse they restrict you under a license who have the objetive of the restric the users, and put them in a potion of weakness
[06:01:31] <Noisytoot> fatal: I don't think so.
[06:01:34] <isf> the only moral way to use software, is run only free software.

[06:07:23] <fatal> it's just an irc channel...
[06:07:46] <isf> im a free software activist, so part of my life i share the free software ideals to others.
[06:08:12] <isf> but my life isnt about free software. say that is a lie. 
[06:08:28] <fatal> sad that they stranded here of all places tho
[06:08:29] <isf> But, when i use software, i only use free software. becouse free software is the only moral software you can run
[06:08:46] <isf> and i make the example running only free software, for make a example to others that is possible
[06:08:47] <fatal> i mean sad for them
[06:08:59] <Noisytoot> isf: It is possible to use Debian without using any nonfree software.
[06:09:03] <isf> why? becouse they dont deserve have freedom?
[06:09:04] <kompowiec2[x]> isf: I don't want to offend you, but if your approach can piss off people from this milieu, I can't imagine how you can annoy them outside.
[06:09:11] <isf> you are part of opensource noisytoot, say it
[06:09:22] <isf> xd
[06:09:28] <Noisytoot> isf: No, because it's incorrect.
[06:09:46] <isf> kompowiec, you say it becouse i dont say linux and i say gnu/linux?
[06:09:51] <Noisytoot> isf: You can just not install the nonfree packages.
[06:09:53] <isf> as you say?
[06:09:59] <isf> Noisytoot
[06:10:06] <isf> i recommend you read a bit the gnu.org page
[06:10:13] <kompowiec2[x]> S/milieu/environment
[06:10:29] <isf> https://www.gnu.org/distros/optionally-free-not-enough.html Noisytoot
[06:11:07] <isf> here for more information about why debian isnt a free distribution: https://www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.html
[06:11:13] <fatal> i wonder what their contribution to the free software movement is tho besides preaching to the crowd
[06:11:15] <Noisytoot> isf: I recommend you read https://www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.html#Debian. My statement is correct, it is possible to have a fully free Debian installation. That doesn't mean that Debian is FSDG-compliant.
[06:11:15] <isf> maybe you never read it and you dont understend it :)
[06:11:29] <isf> please, read it correctly
[06:11:57] <isf> ubuntu can be change for run only free software
[06:11:58] <Noisytoot> Where "fully free" means "does not contain any nonfree software"
[06:12:01] <isf> so i recommend ubuntu?
[06:12:05] <isf> ofcourse not!
[06:12:16] <kompowiec2[x]> isf: I say it because I'm worried. it can be detrimental both to you and to opinion for this nonetheless hermetic environment
[06:12:20] <isf> Trisquel is the replacement to ubuntu becouse ubuntu is propietary disitrubtion
[06:12:23] <Noisytoot> I'm not recommending Debian, I am saying it is possible to have a fully free installation.
[06:12:28] <isf> you are recommending
[06:12:30] <isf> debian
[06:12:36] <isf> without say "i recommend"
[06:12:42] <kompowiec2[x]> fatal: he is spain btw
[06:12:49] <isf> im not spain
[06:12:53] <isf> im not european
[06:12:57] <kompowiec2[x]> spanish*
[06:13:01] <isf> im not spanish
[06:13:04] <isf> im not european
[06:13:11] <Noisytoot> No, I am saying it is possible to have a fully free installation, which is correct.
[06:13:12] <isf> spanish people are from spain
[06:13:16] <Noisytoot> You speak spanish then.
[06:13:18] <fatal> well it doesn't matter really
[06:13:34] <isf> i have better arguments
[06:13:42] <isf> but you cant understend spanish
[06:13:44] <kompowiec2[x]> At least you know why his english isnt so good
[06:14:10] <isf> any way. Free software and free distros are the only operating system you can install in a moral and ethic way
[06:14:18] <isf> becouse the others distros recommend, and support nonfree software.
[06:14:30] <fatal> it's really not the spelling
[06:14:32] <isf> that the reason debian arent in: https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html
[06:14:40] <isf> you dont understend spanish
[06:15:11] <isf> so if you want understend me better go to try to study spanish as im trying to do it in english for speak with people like you for share the ideals of freedom
[06:15:18] <isf> becouse you dont care, how you say it.
[06:15:35] <fatal> do you collect crystals by any chance?
[06:16:16] <isf> see, im not trying to force you to install a free distro
[06:16:24] <fatal> did you leave any religious movements recently?
[06:16:35] <isf> i dont care about if you have or not freedom, or if you sell your freedom or not
[06:16:39] <kompowiec2[x]> > i have better arguments
[06:16:39] <kompowiec2[x]> you are not persuading almost anyone in this way

[06:16:42] <kompowiec2[x]> If you really care about it and don't just want to piss people off
[06:16:45] <Noisytoot> isf: The reason Debian isn't FSDG-compliant is https://www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.html#Debian
[06:16:54] <Whistler> the immoral/unethical thing is the practise of non-free software publishers to restrict users, not using debian
[06:17:05] <isf> i dont care abou him sell his freedom or his lose his freedom, that dont affect me
[06:17:06] <Whistler> since when using debian can be immoral?
[06:17:17] <anton> they have repos for nonfree software
[06:17:26] <isf> ok all here are opensource movement?
[06:17:26] <isf> lol
[06:17:33] <anton> this isn't opensource
[06:17:38] <isf> all here are recommending distribution who dont respect the users freedom?
[06:17:40] <isf> lol

[06:17:46] <isf> all here from opensource realy?
[06:17:57] <anton> isf: this isn't open-source
[06:17:58] <isf> where is the people promoting the free distros?
[06:17:59] <kompowiec2[x]> Oh gosh...
[06:18:04] <Noisytoot> isf: Nobody recommended Debian. Either way that isn't related to the OSI.
[06:18:06] <anton> this is the free software foundation
[06:18:13] <isf> where is the people promoting the free software movement?
[06:18:18] <anton> all around
[06:18:24] <isf> you know for the free software movement the debian issue is so sad
[06:18:32] <isf> becouse the fsf help the debian in the start
[06:18:47] <fatal> just wait until isf turns up on one of the free software summits
[06:18:48] <isf> but now they move to the opensource, so they dont care about you freedom
[06:19:01] <isf> thats the reason debian dont respect the users freedom, becouse share, recommend and support nonfree software
[06:19:11] <anton> I'm confused
[06:19:16] <Noisytoot> isf: Have you actually read the open source definition? It's very similar to the free software definition.
[06:19:16] <isf> sadly, here looks more like a opensource movement
[06:19:34] <isf> thats the reason you are against the free software ladder Noisytoot?
[06:19:44] <fatal> er, debian doesn't respect what now?
[06:19:45] <isf> please, here all are part of the opensource
[06:19:48] <Noisytoot> isf: No, because I'm not against it.
[06:19:48] <anton> is that a troll?
[06:19:48] <isf> lol!
[06:19:58] <anton> I think we're getting trolled right now
[06:20:05] <isf> you are part of the opensource Noisytoot
[06:20:11] <Noisytoot> isf: No, I'm not.
[06:20:13] <isf> you say it, yo share the ideals with them
[06:20:20] <anton> Noisytoot is free software
[06:20:32] <isf> but him arent ok with the freedom ladder
[06:20:34] <Noisytoot> anton: I support free software, I am not actually software
[06:20:49] <isf> him say "install debian, dont worry about install nonfree software how they do"
[06:20:50] <anton> poor wording lol
[06:20:56] <fatal> AMEN, isf. tell em the truth.
[06:21:02] <kompowiec2[x]> anton: worse. he seems to be lost, because quite possibly he has crossed the gate of fundamentalism
[06:21:19] <anton> huh
[06:21:20] <isf> kompowiec, you dont like gnu
[06:21:31] <kompowiec2[x]> You see?
[06:21:33] <isf> you always say linux, becouse you dont care about the free software movement
[06:21:45] <Noisytoot> isf: I said "It is possible to have a fully free Debian installation", which is very different from "Install Debian. Don't worry about installing nonfree software"
[06:21:50] <isf> say gnu/linux isnt a issue for the fundamtalist how  you say
[06:22:04] <isf> if is possible or not
[06:22:12] <isf> is the diferent issue
[06:22:15] <isf> you never read the gnu.org

[06:25:18] <isf> you are defending the debian

[09:14:32] <Andrew> Sounds like a "good" idea
[09:14:42] <damo22> DiffieHellman: yes and it also supports a Xeon E3-something
[09:15:05] <tpefreedom> xeon model names confuse me
[09:15:52] <damo22> the point being, coreboot can initialise the ECC ram on this workstation board using sandybridge native init
[09:16:13] <damo22> so xeons that fit in the board can still be used
[09:16:19] <tpefreedom> damo22, I'd go for amd anyway. intel does some other anticonsumer stuff like locking overclocking to certain models.
[09:16:53] <DiffieHellman> Sadly, Starting from Nehalem the Intel ME firmware can't be removed anymore, so that's not what I want
[09:17:02] <euphoricallysane> And pay for feature is coming, why I still rock Itanium/rdram ;)
[09:17:02] <damo22> ok
[09:17:04] <euphoricallysane> ick
[09:17:33] <euphoricallysane> It is turtles the whole way down, and no jtag
[09:17:47] <tpefreedom> euphoricallysane, does itanium not support ddr?
[09:17:59] <euphoricallysane> Iirc it did for a time
[09:18:03] <damo22> im running i7-2760QM
[09:18:06] <DiffieHellman> The FSF foundation reportably uses KGPE-D16's for their desktops, so I wonder what BIOS they use.
[09:18:22] <tpefreedom> euphoricallysane,  but not on the cpu/mobo you have
[09:18:41] <tpefreedom> libreboot probably

[09:19:04] <euphoricallysane> I was joking. Currently (as in this moment) using a gifted mbp running mint
[09:19:22] <euphoricallysane> Runnning from usb, while I choose the right ssd/adapter
[09:20:13] <tpefreedom> why mint?
[09:20:23] <damo22> DiffieHellman: yes i would be curious what bios and cooling they use
[09:20:24] <euphoricallysane> Bc I needed systemd
[09:20:37] <euphoricallysane> Debootstrapped, upgraded from devuan
[09:20:51] <euphoricallysane> <3 devuan, for the most part... not trying to start a war
[09:21:21] <tpefreedom> what about fedora? or stock debian?
[09:22:24] <damo22> the management engine debacle can be avoided on certain boards that have a dedicated NIC port for the manageability feature
[09:22:38] <damo22> you simply dont connect a cable to the port
[09:22:53] <damo22> the problem with laptop ones is that there is a shared port for both
[09:23:08] <DiffieHellman> damo22: That really doesn't avoid the ME, as the backdoor is still on the die and you can boot the hardware up without the ME.
[09:23:08] <euphoricallysane> Oh, debian is my jam and has been forever, but I had a need that I can't remember, too many drinks, and neither satisfied. I think that it came down to an edge case and me not caring about this machine at the time
[09:23:41] <damo22> DiffieHellman: how? i dont think you can without the cable connected
[09:24:39] <DiffieHellman> damo22: The dedicated NIC port may be the only port you can manage from, but anything after Nehalem requires the ME to boot up.
[09:25:07] <damo22> correct, but you can cripple it by wiping 95% of its firmware

[09:26:16] <damo22> i agree its not ideal, but i am willing to risk it for the amount of cpu speed i gain from upgrading from say, x200 to x230
[09:26:32] <euphoricallysane> Besides, I'd not used mint for a decade
[09:26:47] <euphoricallysane> xfce4life
[09:27:49] <euphoricallysane> Damn, I'm primed to inadvertently start a war... busybox...
[09:28:03] <klys> yeah I'm using openbox
[09:28:05] <jxself> GNU Coreutils!
[09:28:22] <euphoricallysane> klys, openbox, how implemented?
[09:28:35] <klys> the window manager...?
[09:28:38] <euphoricallysane> Oh
[09:28:44] <euphoricallysane> ugh, barebox is on my mind
[09:28:58] <euphoricallysane> I had it working on x86_64 a long time ago... 
[09:29:23] <euphoricallysane> One bastard from the google soc had it sooo nice. Been wondering how, since
[09:30:07] <euphoricallysane> I was attempting to build it to be used as an option rom, to use sdhcpci
[09:30:17] <euphoricallysane> Long time ago
[09:30:37] <damo22> euphoricallysane: if it builds as a standalone elf binary, you can chainload it from coreboot
[09:30:48] <euphoricallysane> No coreboot on the machine
[09:30:56] <damo22> oh
[09:30:58] <euphoricallysane> I was trying to write a loader in asm
[09:31:19] <damo22> x86_64 needs ram bringup
[09:31:23] <euphoricallysane> Hell, I even delved into freedos as an option rom
[09:31:33] <euphoricallysane> yeah, old shoes... maybe another day, but cool
[09:31:42] <euphoricallysane> :) missed irc
[09:32:28] <euphoricallysane> I had a whopping 48KB
[09:32:32] <euphoricallysane> that is a lot
[09:32:49] <euphoricallysane> btw 2 segments of the spi, though
[09:33:13] <euphoricallysane> er was it mmcpci, can't remember the nomenclature

[09:55:29] <DiffieHellman> Things seem to be getting worse for GPL compliance.
[09:56:00] <DiffieHellman> Pretty much every Android mobile violates the GPLv2 and there's more and more models coming out.
[09:56:04] * euphoricallysane throws tivos at glass houses
[09:57:51] <damo22> euphoricallysane: RAM [ OK ]
[09:57:53] <euphoricallysane> Yeh. LG just sold of their mobile devision and disabled their bootloader/warranty unlock code server. It isn't gpl, but damn
[09:58:17] <euphoricallysane> Just release a keygen, pl
[09:58:19] <DiffieHellman> Bootloader locking arguably violates the GPLv2 even more.
[09:58:20] <euphoricallysane> plz*
[09:59:00] * euphoricallysane refrains from talking about secure boot
[09:59:16] <damo22> https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/233765803630 hmm
[09:59:47] <DiffieHellman> euphoricallysane: Secure boot doesn't violate the GPLv2 or GPLv3, as the user can set their own keys.
[10:00:48] <euphoricallysane> I am talking about iplementation and the lag that was expected, as a platform for a deeper conversation, I know that will be harder to articulate, might cause a war, and I've had too much beer to get into it, and or, talk to myself DiffieHellman

In 2006, he was able and really willing to give me the full datasheet for a netgear router, manufactured in mass, in 2002... think it was a Netgear rp614
