[17:30:26] <kompowiec> most people also have a car that works like a power generator.
[17:31:09] <kompowiec> another thing is that during the blackout, you won't be able to buy fuel (oh irony).
[17:32:20] <kompowiec> i recommended fiction book in this topic btw. Marc Elsberg - Blackout: Tomorrow Will Be Too Late
[17:33:42] <M6piz7wk[m]> kompowiec: that's 472Wh so you will need 24 of those 1m2 panels just to sustain it on a land with 100% sun coverage which is unrealistic so more like 32 of them covering 32m2 with reserves which are usually around 20% of the whole thing so additional 7m2 + storage when the sun is not shining so 472Wh times the amount of expected shade which is around 18 of the large packs so infrastracture worth of 3800 EUR + installation +- 700 EUR + land
[17:33:42] <M6piz7wk[m]> maintenance 
[17:34:12] <M6piz7wk[m]> compared to 1/8th of maintaining a modern and much more powerful system or even using powerpc like raptorcs 
[17:35:08] <kompowiec> well, due to global heating, the EU will already be pouring bags of money into almost every person interested in photovoltaics.
[17:35:40] <M6piz7wk[m]> oh right cost of 32 photovoltaics.. probably around 8000 EUR 
[17:36:10] <kompowiec> in Poland so far, I see such panels only in rural areas.
[17:36:57] <kompowiec> but there are plans to cover them, for example, on the roofs of residential buildings.
[17:37:17] <M6piz7wk[m]> hm still viking D8 is terrible gift to anyone
[17:38:18] <kompowiec> and this despite the fact that we only have access to full sun for about 3 months. Most of the year it is gray, drab, gloomy here and the sun is barely creeping over the horizon.

[17:50:34] <GNUmer> Although Finland is known as a dark and cold country, I see photovoltaics having a chance here. On many winter days, the snow usually reflects a lot of sunlight, which is usually why a lot of Finns coming back from vacation in the north have gotten suntans. Because the snow reflects the sunlight so well, it could be a good source of electricity even in the winter.
[17:52:18] <M6piz7wk[m]> Finland is getting their power from water and wind mostly
[17:52:54] <M6piz7wk[m]> last time i checked they were really close to net-zero even hetzner has a datacenter there which is 100% on clean energy

[18:03:24] <kompowiec> in our country the water level in rivers is systematically dropping ...
[18:03:59] <kompowiec> wind? Well, we have the most moderate climate in the world (probably)
[18:04:30] <GNUmer> la_mettrie: We currently have 4 active nuclear power plants with the 5th being built close to me. I'm still worried about the 5th one, since it's built and partially owned by the Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom.
[18:05:48] <kompowiec> in fact, it is thanks to global heating that this has changed, which means that winds and rains are systematically getting shorter and stronger.

[20:08:02] <M6piz7wk[m]> Armand: the notebook comes without CPU, but the architecture and relevant docs are publicly available so you can make the CPU too if you have the infra
[20:08:34] <M6piz7wk[m]> else 20~4000 EUR outsourced
[20:09:03] <Noisytoot> 200 EUR is more than my ThinkPad X200 costed
[20:09:10] <Armand> You know what R&D costs are like then ?
[20:09:16] <Armand> ... and the equipment costs?
[20:09:32] <Armand> Noisytoot: Mate, my X220t was Â£95. ^_^
[20:09:38] <Armand> inc shipping.
[20:10:04] <Noisytoot> Armand, My X200 was Â£89

[20:11:07] <M6piz7wk[m]> and yes i know the R&D is around 30K EUR which was crowdsourced
[20:11:10] <GNUmer> I'm fine with my Thinkpad X230. What I'm waiting for is an affordable PPC desktop motherboard & CPU.
[20:11:11] <Armand> Haahaha
[20:11:19] <Armand> CPUs cost a lot more to develop
[20:11:45] <M6piz7wk[m]> Armand: i was talking about the mobo
[20:11:58] <M6piz7wk[m]> the CPU is developed by the openpower foundation so that is also already paid for you

[20:12:24] <Armand> But what if I don't want someone else's CPU?
[20:13:04] <M6piz7wk[m]> make it? Entry is 1800 EUR last time i checked and 2000 EUR for the materials
[20:13:30] <jxself> But your own CPU fabrication plant? :)
[20:13:47] <M6piz7wk[m]> or outsource it for 20~3000 EUR :p
[20:13:54] <M6piz7wk[m]> or even use power8 which is allegedly compatible
[20:15:02] <Armand> I think I'll stick with the 8-bit CPU my mate is working on. :)
[20:15:44] <M6piz7wk[m]> https://github.com/open-power should have everything you need to make the CPU
[20:16:06] <Noisytoot> Not the tools to make the CPU.
[20:16:12] <Noisytoot> or the materials.
[20:16:30] <M6piz7wk[m]> yes if you lack the skills to make the CPU it's better to outsource it

[20:17:21] <Noisytoot> 20 EUR isn't
[20:17:23] <M6piz7wk[m]> lowest i could find the CPU locally
[20:17:26] <Noisytoot> 3000 EUR is
[20:17:57] <M6piz7wk[m]> then don't buy the 3K EUR?
[20:18:11] <M6piz7wk[m]> you probably need a business plan to justify that cost as that is designed for super computers
[20:19:15] <M6piz7wk[m]> but you can have that in your notebook if you wish :p

[23:36:11] <GNUmer> saintwatermelon: Hardware and drivers. Partially decoupling myself from proprietary messengers too.
[23:38:33] <GNUmer> I got an X230 due to it still being fairly new-ish while having decent free driver support. It does not support Libreboot but does support Osboot, which is a Libreboot fork with binary blobs. I think Libreboot support will come eventually.
[23:39:29] <GNUHacker> all my software is Libre/Free
[23:40:53] <GNUHacker> I use GNU Guix system https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html
[23:42:32] <saintwatermelon> GNUHacker: I decided to try Gentoo with Linux-libre kernel.

[23:52:56] <GNUmer> GNUHacker: That's actually how I got into free software. I had to give a presentation in my religion class and had to interview someone from some religion. Since my region is heavily religious and is a stronghold for many sects, interviewing a priest of either one of the main churches or a priest from one of the powerful regional sects really felt like an uncomfortable idea. I went to search for a parody religion and as a techy person found
[23:52:56] <GNUmer>  the Church of Emacs. I sent an email with my questions to Stallman never expecting a response. On a Sunday morning, a day before my presentation was due, I woke up to an email from RMS answering my questions. As I got an excellent grade from that presentation and course, I looked into free software as he took time out of his schedule to help me pass that class. Ever since, I've made active decisions to climb the freedom ladder and advocate
[23:52:56] <GNUmer>  for the freedom of others.
