[00:06:54] <dante443> So, to add to my original question: I need to check that the array has rows since this is for a standard CRUD list view. I check that "state" from the useReducer == "fetched", which is the same point that the response data is loaded into the useReducer state var. The problem is that the condition is showing true for rows == 0 for a split second before the data loads to the component. I do not
[00:06:56] <dante443> want to submit to the race condition and include a timeout, but is that the only way to deal with this situation?

[00:39:40] <l__q> im think is is
[00:40:18] <ljharb> ping sends a packet and waits for a response
[00:40:19] <l__q> you can try this in home, you make sure you have internet 32kbps
[00:40:29] <ljharb> lol virtually nobody has internet that slow
[00:40:40] <ljharb> l__q: ping is very different from "the speed your website loads", because that involves a webserver
[00:40:47] <l__q> ljharb: thats is the idea, but it doosent do it so!
[00:41:10] <ljharb> l__q: what is the idea
[00:41:27] <ljharb> l__q: if ping says 50ms then that's what the latency is
[00:41:39] <ljharb> any other slowness is the fault of your webserver and/or the browser and how much data's being sent.
[00:41:59] <l__q> the idea of ping is that send a packet and waits for a response, but it dosetnw work on very slow networks!
[00:42:12] <l__q> ping is buggy
[00:42:21] <ljharb> it does work and it's not buggy
[00:42:42] <ljharb> i can certainly see how, if you have a very slow network, ping might not track which packet was which
[00:42:49] <l__q> ljharb: if you ping is >1000000ms it dostent work property
[00:42:50] <ljharb> so you'd get a bunch of timeouts, and a very fast ping, rather than the proper slow ping
[00:43:11] <l__q> bug?
[00:43:17] <ljharb> no
[00:43:25] <l__q> hm?
[00:43:25] <ljharb> but it seems like something that would have been improved a long time ago
[00:43:34] <ljharb> where is your ping program from
[00:43:52] <l__q> my ping program is ping on macos
[00:43:59] <DPA> Ping usually sends ICMP echo requests and waits for the response. A website is usually accessed using HTTP / HTTPS over TCP on port 80 or 443 instead.
[00:43:59] <DPA> Packages of different types, to different ports, etc. can be routed, processed, manipulated, etc. in completely different & independent ways by all the  devices the packages pass through.
[00:43:59] <DPA> In addition to this, browsers may open connections in advance if a website may be visited, and often open multiple connections for parallel requests and keep at least one around in case another request has to be made.
[00:44:36] <l__q> but if you have a ping >1_000_000ms the ping command dosent works as expect!

[02:03:28] <GreenJello> teut, functions are private by default in JS, and methods can be made private
[02:04:04] <teut> are you talking about es15 classes?
[02:04:21] <teut> es6 is it called ?
[02:04:32] <teut> 6 or 2015

[02:12:41] <ljharb> teut: it's ES6 because it's the 6th edition, but its name is ES2015
[02:13:27] <teut> ok, but >   functions are private means what according to you?
[02:13:34] <entuland> you can make functions / variable / methods and so forth private just fine (private to a module, private to an object prototype, private to the guts of a function as well) - the main issue I personally have with "class inheritance" in JS is that there is no encapsulation (there is no way to hide anything from a super class to a derived class) - for that reason I'm not going to use classes at all in JS, I'm fine with just instantiating my functions
[02:13:34] <entuland> without any inheritance
[02:14:48] <entuland> or if there is a way, I don't know how
[02:14:53] <ljharb> teut: everything is private. because of lexical scope.
[02:14:59] <ljharb> teut: things are either reachable or not.
[02:15:00] *** Joins: jmcantrell (~weechat@user/jmcantrell)

[02:15:25] <jellobot> entuland, 3
[02:15:36] <teut> yes, what entuland wrote explains it well
[02:15:40] <ljharb> entuland: subclasses can't access it either.
[02:15:45] <ljharb> teut: but entuland isn't correct.
[02:15:55] <entuland> because of the #?
[02:15:57] <ljharb> entuland: but, all that said, inheritance sucks anyways, so it should be avoided.
[02:16:00] <ljharb> entuland: yes, that's class private fields
[02:16:06] <teut> it looks like they are though
[02:16:07] <stenno> its the difference between private and protected
[02:16:12] <ljharb> there is no "protected"
[02:16:16] <stenno> if you remember your OOP
[02:16:18] <stenno> well yes
[02:16:20] <ljharb> teut: i just said they're not
[02:16:36] <stenno> but if they were accessible they'd be 'protected' and not 'private'
[02:16:36] <ljharb> a subclass instance *gets* the private fields, but the subclass implementation can't observe or access them
[02:16:52] <ljharb> right, using java's "access levels" model. but in JS, that model makes zero sense
[02:16:56] <entuland> ah yes, it was the protected thing that was missing
[02:17:11] <teut> protected, does anyone uses that?
[02:17:16] <stenno> not in JS

[14:18:45] <hassoon> shan: a window load event is what you need
[14:19:07] <hassoon> shan: plus, DOMContentLoaded fires on the document, not window
[14:20:28] <shan> hassoon: 1) i was told that onload fires way too late and 2) your snippet still has the issue that it doesn't catch the error thrown in createPrompt() on line 118
[14:21:08] <shan> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/DOMContentLoaded_event also this seems to indicate it fires on the Window
[14:21:39] <stenno> the onclick throw will not be caught by the try-catch
[14:21:47] <stenno> because it will be executed outside of that context
[14:21:55] <shan> is there any way to catch it

[14:24:13] <stenno> the only way i can think of is to wrap your whole code in try-catch and that is most def. a total antipattern

[14:25:26] <stenno> you could promisify it and then just try/catch the await call

[15:51:16] <stenno> changing fragments will not cause a reload

[20:21:56] <wroathe> The concern there is that a malicious actor could set up a similar domain to yours, iframe your page in, and then put a form input or similar over the top of your iframe page so that it looks like the user is entering the password for your site, but is in actuality sending the attacker their password (or any number of other actions)
[20:22:16] <wroathe> And then the attacker is just one phishing link away from harvesting your user's sensitive data
[20:23:18] <systemfault> But that's not the concern of the webdev... since they're the one who added the clickjacking to their website :p
[20:23:37] <systemfault> But from the user PoV, yeah... it's bad.

[20:23:53] <wroathe> systemfault: It's the concern fo the webdev because they need to ensure that the server is sending that CSP header with the right directive to prevent the attacker from iframing the page in
[20:24:08] <ljharb> you have to worry about that whether you're using iframes or not
[20:24:09] <wroathe> systemfault: Or add the javascript to break out of the iframe if it's not the topmost frame

[20:29:38] <unixcat64> Hi all. Okay so, I have a static html site, and for code blocks, only the <pre> element is used. I want to get syntax highlighting in those code blocks with Prism.js, but Prism.js only works with <code> elements. So I want to write a JS script that selects the <pre> elements and inserts <code> elements in between them. I don't know JS but this
[20:29:38] <unixcat64> seems like a fairly trivial task for someone who does (maybe like a few lines of code or a function?)

[20:34:36] <entuland> unixcat64, yes it's fairly simple, but it's probably better to do a pass on the static HTML files and replace the tag
[20:34:57] <entuland> you should also doublecheck the docs for that library as it may allow you customizing that tag
[20:34:59] <unixcat64> entuland yeah I was thinking something like that too
[20:35:19] <unixcat64> entuland it's HTML generated from Vimwiki
[20:37:13] <unixcat64> so like a pseudo code of what I want would be something like: for each <pre> element in file, replace(<pre>, <code>), etc
[20:37:30] <entuland> yep
[20:37:33] <unixcat64> or in this case, replace <pre> with <pre><code> etc
[20:37:51] <entuland> querySelectorAll, replaceChild
[20:38:10] <entuland> it's a couple of lines and if you know coding, just a quick lookup in the MDN references should get you going without any library

[21:16:48] <aiena> Ican alsi uuse "if obj[foo] === 'undefined' {}" to test if the key exists?
[21:16:58] <aiena> *I can also
[21:17:19] <wroathe> In JS the key existing is different than the prop having a defined value
[21:17:26] <systemfault> That test the presence of the value, not the key

[21:18:39] <stenno> what huh
[21:18:52] <wroathe> obj[foo] === undefined is perfectly reasonable if you only care about the key having a defined value
[21:18:54] <aiena> this is actually a google sheets script but in the end its JS too.
[21:19:06] <wroathe> You rarely actually care about whether the key actually exists on the object or not

[21:23:10] <aiena> i could use the else block
[21:23:14] <stenno> !('foo' in bla)
[21:24:35] <wroathe> aiena: To be clear, are you trying to determine whether obj has the property "foo" defined on it, or whether "foo" has a defined value?
[21:25:10] <aiena> if the property does not exists I want to initialise the property with an empty array
[21:25:21] <aiena> or reuse the property
[21:25:52] <wroathe> aiena: Would you consider "foo" with a value of undefined as being existing?
[21:26:03] <wroathe> aiena: { foo: undefined } // does foo "exist"?
[21:26:42] <aiena> i think a foo with a blank value would be one which does not exists
[21:26:49] <wroathe> There it is
[21:26:53] <wroathe> aiena: obj.foo ||= []
[21:26:53] <aiena> as in this case a cell value is never undefined
[21:27:58] <aiena> wroathe: what is thids ||= thing need to read about it
[21:28:56] <wroathe> aiena: Logical OR assignment. A shorthand for obj.foo = obj.foo || []

[21:32:31] <stenno> it does, but || works on falsy, not nullish
[21:32:43] <stenno> yes, i used it too
[21:32:52] <stenno> depends on the situation, yeah, on the specific data

[23:16:49] <ljharb> harpia: every library supports ESM
[23:16:58] <ljharb> harpia: because in node, ESM can import CJS
[23:17:10] <ljharb> harpia: so since modern web dev requires a bundler, there shouldn't be any issue
[23:17:35] <ljharb> harpia: unless you're saying the library isn't a module at all, and is some kind of archaic "makes a global" thing
[23:17:38] <merpnderp> ljharb: but isn't he saying his module simply exposes itself as a global?
[23:17:43] <merpnderp> On the window object?
[23:17:52] <ljharb> yeah maybe so, i figured that out jut now
[23:17:53] <ljharb> *just
[23:17:54] <merpnderp> Like some sort of cheap hooker?
[23:18:01] <ljharb> but in that case, find another library :-)
[23:18:09] <harpia> It's algolia autocomplete before version 1...
[23:18:26] <harpia> To use the newer versions I have to transform their bare specifiers into relative imports, you know?

[23:18:44] <merpnderp> More importantly, you don't *want* to do that.

[23:19:38] <merpnderp> There's an esm version here: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@algolia/autocomplete-js@1.1.0/dist/esm/autocomplete.js Otherwise you can always install via npm instead of via cdn

[23:20:41] <harpia> ouch...
[23:21:02] <ljharb> modern web dev requires using a bundler (likely with a transpiler), and node, for the build process.
[23:21:04] <harpia> boss doesn't let me use any package managers like npm and composer (php)
[23:21:08] <ljharb> lolwut
[23:21:10] <harpia> it sucks, i know
[23:21:17] <ljharb> if you can't use npm then you can't use "all the javascript that matters"
[23:21:43] <ljharb> harpia: in that case, use https://unpkg.com/@algolia/autocomplete-js@1.2.2/dist/umd/index.production.js
[23:21:53] <ljharb> harpia: which yes, requires a separate script tag and makes a global
[23:22:05] <ljharb> harpia: but also make sure your boss knows they're keeping you in the stone age :-)
[23:22:07] <harpia> yeah, i'll have to use it that way
[23:22:16] <merpnderp> Well that changes the solution from a technical one, to a professional one. Find a new job. You won't gain experience and build up a resume doing things the way no one else will pay you to do.
[23:22:33] <ljharb> ^ that is accurate but there's a lot more and different kinds of reasons why that's difficult.
[23:22:46] <harpia> yeah, it's my first job, but eventually I'll find something better
[23:23:10] <ljharb> i will definitely callously tell people to drop their shitty stack and use the right one, but even i can't be so harsh about changing jobs (when i think it through)
[23:23:17] <merpnderp> Like if you aren't doing unit tests, it will be hard to find a job since everyone wants unit test experience.
[23:23:50] <merpnderp> But if you aren't using a build process, doing unit tests is hard.
