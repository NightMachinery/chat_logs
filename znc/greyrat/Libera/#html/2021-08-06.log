[16:51:14] <lind{at}yahoo> any suggestions on making this table display better on mobile: https://thespaceforce.world ?
[16:51:49] <lind{at}yahoo> I'm thinking an @media but I'm already using bootstrap's small font class
[16:53:52] <entuland> lind{at}yahoo, the fact of using bootstrap doesn't mean you can't use @media
[16:54:06] <entuland> the main issue with that table is that you're not giving it enough room (not even on desktop)
[16:54:55] <lind{at}yahoo> it renders fine on my desktop... whats your res?
[16:55:29] <entuland> 1080p, it sucks to have headers wrapping like that
[16:55:39] <entuland> just give the table the full available width
[16:57:04] <lind{at}yahoo> yeah the headers wrap on my end too.. the only way around on that on desktop would be giving it two wide and not stacked next to eachother, but that doesn't help on mobile since I have basically the same width
[16:58:35] <entuland> on mobile you either give the table a wrapper that scrolls horizontally, keeping a minimum width as you've been suggested in #css, or you rethink the presentation of the data
[17:04:53] <lind{at}yahoo> scroll is acceptable

[17:05:36] <lind{at}yahoo> entuland: can you provide me with a basic link on how I setup that scroll? I can figure out the rest, I think a fiddle for this over kill
[17:08:03] <entuland> <div style="overflow-x: auto"><table>...</table></div>
[17:08:20] <lind{at}yahoo> so I don't even need a media tag then?
[17:08:26] <entuland> the horizontal scrollbar will appear only when the div will not have enough room for the minimum width of the table
[17:08:32] <entuland> no, just for that, no
[17:08:59] <entuland> that way the table will become scrollable also on desktop if they happen to narrow down the window a lot
[17:13:25] <lind{at}yahoo> roger that
[17:23:04] *** Joins: mcglk (~mcglk@131.191.49.120)
[17:27:09] <lind{at}yahoo> entuland: do I put that on the table, or a div encapsulating the table?
[17:29:18] <entuland> you can't set the table to overflow
[17:29:24] <entuland> you need a wrapper
[17:30:01] <entuland> or maybe you can? hang on
[17:31:38] <entuland> nope, you can't, you need a wrapper
[17:32:32] <entuland> https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/tg4um1xq/
[17:35:10] <lind{at}yahoo> hmm maybe I need to throw a min-width on the table
[17:37:35] <lind{at}yahoo> frak I'm going to have to fiddle this, something is causing this not to work
[17:37:54] <lind{at}yahoo> whats the best fiddle site, the one I got in #css is pretty unusable
[17:38:04] <lind{at}yahoo> entuland: ^^
[17:38:24] <entuland> yep, you'd need a min-width
[17:38:33] <entuland> I use jsfiddle only pretty much
[17:38:37] <lind{at}yahoo> do I put it on the table or the div?
[17:38:47] <entuland> the min width goes on the table
[17:39:05] <lind{at}yahoo> hmmm I probably set it too small then
[17:39:21] <entuland> are you sure you _have_ to use a table?
[17:39:33] <entuland> I mean, I get it's tabular data, but there are other ways to display it
[17:44:26] <entuland> but probably you have to retain some horizontal lineup that would need stacking to save space, so yes, maybe you can't

[18:30:51] <lind{at}yahoo> yeah I think it has to be a table
[18:34:03] <lind{at}yahoo> entuland: for bootstrap there is a table-responsive class that goes on the div, giving me a little issue where the default implemention is causing it to scroll too soon, but I can figure that out

[18:35:32] <entuland> unfortunately I don't use bootstrap, you may try setting up a minimal sample on jsfiddle including the required libraries and ask in #css or #javascript depending on where it fits better

[18:38:22] <lind{at}yahoo> hmmm lotta whitespace borders on mobile
[18:38:30] <lind{at}yahoo> leme see if I can clean this up
[18:45:55] <lind{at}yahoo> got it!
[18:46:22] <lind{at}yahoo> there was a p-5 on one of the divs that was adding margin and padding, switched to p-0 and it looks great
[18:48:40] <lind{at}yahoo> hmmm its bleeding over the 3edge
[18:48:50] <lind{at}yahoo> I think I need a max width on the table
