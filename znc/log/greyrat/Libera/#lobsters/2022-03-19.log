[00:05:23] <lukan> hey folks, I am new here
[00:05:50] <lukan> it seems I dropped into a rather heavy discussion?
[00:07:26] <gerikson> I dunno

[00:17:33] <bsandro> 2-3 years ago I moved to nano from vim as a joke/dare, been there ever since
[00:17:53] <river> but spaces actually are better than tab
[00:17:58] <bsandro> tim pooping on my beautiful editor in core macos is blasphemy
[00:18:09] <lukan> "but spaces actually are better than tab"
[00:18:10] <lukan> why?
[00:18:16] <lukan> (hehe)
[00:18:32] <lukan> but I am actually serious/curious
[00:19:16] <tarzeau> <3 can't exit vi(m) memes
[00:19:26] <bsandro> 1 whitespace width, 1 standard, 1 fuhrer
[00:19:28] <pretty_dumm_guy> lukan: i can imagine the reason being different editors assigning different values to a tab ? Like tab is 2 spaces in mine while 4 spaces in others ?
[00:19:56] <bsandro> terminal is usually 8 also yeah so 'git/hg diff' always looks different there
[00:20:07] <pretty_dumm_guy> I can't think of any other reason. is there any ?
[00:20:18] <lukan> "Like tab is 2 spaces in mine while 4 spaces in others ?" yeah, this I hate, too.
[00:20:46] <lukan> but I also hate navigating in spaces when used to tabs
[00:20:54] <lukan> tabs > space
[00:21:51] <bsandro> lots of editors novadays can navigate indentation spaces as if they were tabs but I kinda gave up and just using whatever some gofmt pitches me
[00:22:46] <pretty_dumm_guy> bsandro: yeah that seems to be sane way forward. Do whatever you want but use a tidy tool at the end before pushing to git
[00:24:55] <pretty_dumm_guy> This article is very interesting. I am learning a lot in a short span of time: https://www.brendangregg.com/perf.html

[00:30:29] <lukan> wow, that is a nice site
[00:31:27] <pretty_dumm_guy> yeap. I love his articles. Been trying to be informed about performance after I started reading his articles
[00:32:05] <pretty_dumm_guy> so far no need has risen for me to use his flamegraphs and stuff. But maybe in the future.
[00:40:13] <c355E3B> I'm using that flamegraph stuff every day
[00:41:38] <pretty_dumm_guy> oh wow in what context ? I remember you mentioning something about writing a database sometime ago(hope I am confusing you with someone else :D). Is it to test its performance ?
[00:41:58] <c355E3B> database engine stuff
[00:42:06] <c355E3B> and we have it for all of our java apps which is handy
[00:42:26] <c355E3B> I also got promoted off of the database engine team and I'm having to run our SRE stuff
[00:42:41] <pretty_dumm_guy> sounds thrilling
[00:43:01] <pretty_dumm_guy> have no clue about SRE stuff other than what it stands for
[00:43:09] <c355E3B> I'm getting paid to get gas lit by google at this point
[00:43:19] <pretty_dumm_guy> liking your new role ?
[00:43:24] <c355E3B> Some days
[00:43:24] <pretty_dumm_guy> hahaha thats funny
[00:44:42] <pretty_dumm_guy> promotion led to team change ? is it common ?
[00:50:02] <c355E3B> Depends where you are at
