[02:11:26] <hassoon> there you go
[02:13:17] <hassoon> brentaarnold: 1) you forgot to add class="tailored" in your span html code, 2) your setting up the same color for the span and its text-shadow, 3) i don't see an outline effect following your approach
[02:13:27] <hassoon> brentaarnold: as shown here https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/389
[02:15:25] <brentaarnold> I'm a little confused. Why does both a class and a style need to be specified, shouldn't a style fall under a class?
[02:15:44] <FunkyBob> you need to mark the element as being of that class

[03:10:03] <pavonia> Well yes, the emphasis was on descendants
[03:11:39] <FunkyBob> important, I feel, that lantech19446 understand it's "anywhere in the document", not just "inside <body>"
[03:14:34] <lantech19446> FunkyBob: I mean I got yelled at by the validator because I had some other tag that it considered to be the start of the body and a body tag is header like that?
[03:15:34] <FunkyBob> header is an element that should be inside the <body> if that's what you're asking
[03:16:12] <lantech19446> my teacher mislead me unfortunately he said if you use body p or  say .class a it would only affect paragraphs within body or a links inside that class
[03:16:24] <FunkyBob> that is true
[03:16:35] <lantech19446> FunkyBob: that's another thing I was getting wrong then I've been putting header in its own section of the page
[03:16:36] <FunkyBob> the selector "body p"  means any p t hat is a descendant of body
[03:16:47] <FunkyBob> lantech19446: are you confusing header with <head> ?
[03:16:51] <lantech19446> no
[03:17:17] <FunkyBob> your teacher has not misled you
[03:17:26] <lantech19446> ok what you just said is what i thought so I'm not sure why it was affecting a p tag outside of the body tags
[03:17:37] <FunkyBob> the selector ".class a" does select any a that is a descendant of an element with class "class"
[03:17:52] <FunkyBob> you can't have a <p> outside the <body>
[03:18:23] <FunkyBob> so  your browser is likely applying the html5 "un fuck t he markup" algorithm to assume the start of the <body>
[03:18:26] <lantech19446> I had it inside header which I don't have inside the body, it worked but I didn't know it was improper I'll fix it tomorrow
[03:19:22] <FunkyBob> it worked because browsers are forgiving
[03:19:31] <FunkyBob> ALL content must be inside the <body>
[03:19:42] <lantech19446> ok

[08:15:03] <acagastya> Hi, I have a page with the structure, `<li><a><img/></a></li>...<li><a><img/></a></li>`.  Using media selectors, I want to disable the link from opening on the smaller screens.  Does `li a[href] { z-index: -1; }` seem like an okay hack?  There is only one more `<a>` in the HTML document, but is not under `<li>` and is guaranteed to be like that.
[08:18:56] <acagastya> And more importantly, what did it do in this case, that it worked?  Did the image somehow come above the anchor tag when the z-index was -1?
[08:23:32] <pavonia> Then <a> has gone behind the <li> such that the pointer events are captured by the <li>, I think
[08:27:31] <acagastya> Ah, in that case I can prolly get rid of one rule!  Thanks pavonia.  Though, if there is some other CSS way to do that, please let me know.
[08:30:15] <pavonia> a { pointer-events: none; } should also work
[08:30:45] <pavonia> Or li a[href] { } in that case

[09:08:36] <acagastya> matsaman: that is for a static gallery generator -- it used three column grid on larger screens and images are set to object-fit: cover in a square.  Anyone wishing to see the full image can click to open it in a new tab.

[09:11:02] <acagastya> Why not share the link to the image, in that case?
[09:11:10] <acagastya> the URI is right there.

[09:11:29] <matsaman> you think normos like to long press? Nevermind they don't want to =P
[09:11:39] <matsaman> just plain incongruous
[09:11:44] <matsaman> don't open in new tabs/windows
[09:11:56] <matsaman> don't make small screen versions work greatly differently than large
[09:13:01] <acagastya> It is not greatly different -- on 3-columns, they are cropped to keep sanity of the grid, so anyone who wanted to see the full image -- they could just open it.
[09:13:35] <acagastya> you think normos like to long press? -- I don't know how long-press would work in CSS.
[09:15:15] <matsaman> oksushi: heh
[09:15:43] <matsaman> acagastya: okay so why link for desktop users
[09:16:10] <acagastya> As I said "it used three column grid on larger screens and images are set to object-fit: cover in a square".
[09:17:15] *** Joins: mei (~mei@user/mei)
[09:17:32] <matsaman> you're giving desktop users a link directly to the image, yeah?
[09:21:03] <acagastya> (just a second...)
[09:21:36] <acagastya> https://ibb.co/7tn2F0n
[09:21:42] <acagastya> This is how it looks for larger screens.
[09:22:27] <acagastya> Those images are cropped in squares -- so if anyone wants to see the full image, they can click the image to open it in a new tab.  On mobile, there is no cropping happening.
[09:25:59] <matsaman> I think I understand your train of thought, but still not why it's important to hide links on mobile
[09:27:02] <acagastya> I was trying it on my phone last evening and I ended up opening many images which A) wasn't necessary and B) frustrating.
[09:27:30] <matsaman> probably frustrating because you're using the target attribute
[09:27:40] * matsaman shrugs
[09:30:36] <acagastya> What or how does target attribute adds to this problem?
[09:32:44] <matsaman> you said they open in a new tab
[09:32:53] <matsaman> that's arguably the entire problem
[09:33:22] <acagastya> Well, it should not open on the same tab, that would, imo, be more frustrating than that.
