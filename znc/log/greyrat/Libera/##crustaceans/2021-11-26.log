[02:24:10] <drakonis> i still cant believe this shit
[03:10:14] <edm> Team, this is completely shameless and I apologise to Xe et al if shilling here is not in the spirit of irc and so on, but i presume there must be a few of you who like wine or silly-fun chats about matching food and wine when you have some friends coming over and a bottle that’s taking up space, anf so anyway since the libera displacement ##wine has just been me and another person keeping the rats out but little more than
[03:10:14] <edm> that
[03:10:37] <Xe> this is the good kind of shilling
[03:10:41] <Xe> you are forgiven
[03:11:34] <edm> And if you are anywhere on the multi-dimensional space between making wine from foraged berries to investing in Bordeaux futures, there’s a little corner or irc that needs some love
[03:11:41] <edm> Thank u xe
[03:12:02] <edm> I have always had you down as an appreciator of the arts
[03:14:00] <edm> Also i have no skin in the game but ##cooking is quite a friendly and constructive channel and we all need to eat, and so on
[03:14:40] <edm> Here endeth the shill lest i outstay my welcome
[03:16:19] <edm> Haskell peeps, advent of code starts in 5 days. I did in it rust last year, or at least about 95% of it (family things take over from about the 22nd). Do u think i can learn enough haskell between now and the 1st to have a stab?

[03:31:04] <skyl4rk> I'm not a haskell guy, but I did learn some years ago, and then forgot it. Probably. Perhaps not not the perfect Haskell (TM) way of doing everything. But solve problems, most likely.
[03:32:59] <edm> i suppose i need a 4 day course that will get me into project_euler_++ territory
[03:33:14] <edm> i.e sufficient to break into the first few AoC puzzles
[03:33:49] <edm> a google just now suggests grahan hutton's lectures are well regarded

[11:54:59] <gerikson> I thought it was some rustic brew, like pumpkin juice

[11:55:39] <gerikson> sorry spruce beer
[11:56:09] <bkero> That's just in Oregon.
[11:56:25] <bkero> and that's in gin, typically not beer
[11:57:39] <bkero> Although today I started with a PBR Hard Cold Brew, then company came over and I had 2 Deschutes Red Chair IPAs, then a Basil Hayden old fashioned cocktail, then we had dinner. Then over a fire in the back we had some neat whisky.
[11:58:12] <bkero> I just tapped my Märzen today, so a lot of folks were having that. Does that count as rustic?
[11:58:49] <gerikson> duno
[11:59:03] <gerikson> do you regularly eat squirrels you shoot yourself_
[11:59:22] <gerikson> or wear a cap made from the carcass of a racccoon ?
[12:00:48] <gerikson> man that DHH piece is shit
[12:00:55] <gerikson> but it ddin't really make a splash on HN
[12:02:08] <bkero> No. I read about eating squirrels as a survival strategy if you're stuck in the woods. But it's not very effective.
[12:03:57] <Brekkjern> That FP post is dumb as shit...
[12:04:41] <Brekkjern> >The code will become more concise and expressive.
[12:04:41] <Brekkjern> And in other cases it mutates into the second coming of Cthulhu

[12:09:54] <buttsbot> Advantages of Functional Programming
[12:09:58] <Brekkjern> Yes
[12:11:33] <Geekingfrog> I'm going to abstain then. Right of the bat, the image about the blank page "reasons not to use haskell in prod", ugh
[12:15:48] <gerikson> corporate blogspam
[12:29:45] <edm> jjuran: entirely fair, but they remind me of the early AoC puzzles is all. instead of operating on a list of numbers you just tend to do similar mapping and filtering operations on the lines of a text file. it's a nice warm up
[12:32:03] <gerikson> the first of edition of AoC was not numpy-resistant
[12:32:15] <gerikson> prolly because Wastl is a Perl guy
[12:32:50] <gerikson> also there was one late puzzle in 2018(?) that someone solved in seconds using Z3
[12:58:16] <gthm> man, fuck relatable everyman dhh
[13:00:24] <gerikson> "hello fellow coders, it is I, your fellow race car driver/millionaire"
[13:01:59] <gthm> ++
[13:17:23] <pja> edm: You’re welcome to prod me with (basic) Haskell qs, and historically the lobsters advent-of-code crowd has included some very capable Haskell programmers (shapr & at least one other IIRC).
[13:17:30] <pja> Who have been happy to answer qs.
[13:18:13] <edm> Great! May give it a go, depends on work. Last year was quiet, this year is mad
[13:18:45] <pja> I am in fact a bad Haskell programmer, in that my code tends to devolve into god awful hackery.
[13:19:04] <pja> But that’s fine, I don’t do AoC for work purposes.
[13:20:39] <pja> Right now I’m blanking on the lobsters specific AoC channel name, but the general one on libera (assuming everyone has transitioned from freenode) was pretty chill.
[13:22:39] <leon> #lobsters-advent
[13:22:58] <pja> That’s it!
[13:30:27] <riv> i know uh 90s haskell? the language has changed a lot though
[13:30:34] <riv> and i didn't stay up to date
[13:31:09] <pja> riv: Nothing wrong with 90s Haskell
[13:32:03] <gerikson> best decade
[13:32:46] <pja> Run hugs, get the 90s Haskell experience.
[13:33:22] <pja> IIRC we shipped a product that used hugs internally once. I had to rewrite the thing in C++ to get it to go at a reasonable speed in the end.
[13:33:42] <pja> Not sure why ghc wasn’t an option - it might now have been around at the time.

[15:00:21] <pja> do not copy+paste that is...
[15:00:44] <pja> Someone has been able to get that UK gov URL to redirect to a porn site. Maybe the IP got sold on, who knows?

[15:02:01] <pja> Still a porn site for me. Maybe the routing is weird?
[15:02:41] <pja> I guess if they updated the DNS it will take an hour or two for any cached lookups to clear out of the system.
[15:02:46] <riv> are you sure you didn't typo dft as dtf
[15:02:48] <riv> (joking)
[15:06:14] <pja> Looking at the DNS, my ISP is giving out a different IP to the one you get by tracing down from a root server.
[15:07:02] <riv> i wonder how it was done, maybe some kind of poisoning thing. I'm no DNS expert though
[15:10:12] <jjuran> pja: I get a redirect to www
[15:11:26] <pja> DFT has never been the most well run department. Could easily have been an AWS IP that they let go & forgot was still in the DNS. Some spam porn site happens to pick up the IP & there it is.

[16:27:38] <Brekkjern> Yep
[16:27:57] <dimadima> weird. i've even considered trying powershell given all the love i've heard
[16:27:58] <Brekkjern> "It's too verbose" "Curl doesn't work like that" "Objects are complicated"
[16:28:14] <dimadima> it does objects right?
[16:28:17] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[16:28:28] <Brekkjern> And honestly, they are more like dictionaries
[16:28:36] <dimadima> sure
[16:28:48] <dimadima> i kinda like that
[16:29:13] <Brekkjern> It is a great language. It just doesn't work as well for string manipulation
[16:29:21] <Brekkjern> And since UNIX is all about string manipulation...
[16:29:30] <dimadima> but who manipulates strings are first class computing things anymore
[16:29:37] <dimadima> it's not 1985
[16:29:40] <dimadima> or even 1995 anymore
[16:29:43] <Brekkjern> That is pretty much my point of view too
[16:29:54] <Brekkjern> It's like they want to torture themselves
[16:30:05] <dimadima> i remember those days when all my mom's work was string/line oriented
[16:30:24] <dimadima> well it's not even torture so much as not even what's going on in computing anymore
[16:30:33] <Brekkjern> True
[16:30:38] <dimadima> at least not in most places
[16:30:57] <dimadima> i mean if you're running batch jobs written in the 80s then sure, you're still line-of-text- oriented
[16:31:18] <dimadima> anyway who am i to talk, gwozniak explained mainframes to me here 3 months ago, so :)
[16:31:32] <Brekkjern> It's really dumb to call jq on a JSON file to pull out some string to do more string manipulation :S
[16:31:41] <Brekkjern> And xargs is just...
[16:31:54] <dimadima> all that stuff has tons of corner cases when it comes to streaming

[16:55:38] <gthm> I have charged that windmill many times
[16:56:13] <jjuran> Not everyone needs to be an expert on algorithms, but everyone does need to know how to use Git.  Do the interviews cover that?
[16:56:34] <Brekkjern> I'm not really all that impressed by the algorithm and datastructures course at my university, so I don't really see what value that kind of interview gives if you are just looking for people with bachelors degrees
[16:56:58] <jjuran> Right, you're selecting for education, not ability.
[16:57:06] <Brekkjern> Pretty much
[16:57:12] <Brekkjern> And the education isn't all that great either
[16:57:17] <gthm> and for having the time and resources to be able to prepare for these kinds of interviews
[16:57:51] <Brekkjern> IMO, it selects for people who are bright enough to figure it out on the fly, or have spent time doing interview preperation
[16:57:57] <Geekingfrog> At least it scales !!!1one  You can give scripts to non technical recruiter so they can weed out obvious duds before involving your more expensive corporate resources
[16:58:21] <jjuran> "We hire CS grads from both schools — MIT /and/ Stanford"
[16:59:36] <Geekingfrog> To be fair, it's a pretty hard problem, how do you select people in a reasonable way, without too much bias, and in a not too expensive fashion?
[17:00:15] <gthm> I've proposed questions that look more like what we actually ask people to do on the job, basically "look up some data, loop and filter and mutate and return", and have been told they're too trivial
[17:00:50] <Geekingfrog> well, that could solve the hiring problem I'm sure you're having "but there are not enough competent candidates!"
[17:00:51] <Brekkjern> If you are looking for juniors, isn't that what you want?
[17:01:07] <gthm> it is
[17:01:13] <gthm> and we are explicitly looking for juniors
[17:01:24] <Geekingfrog> it is definitely not too trivial for junior
[17:01:25] <jjuran> When I interviewed with Microsoft's Mac Business Unit, they asked relevant questions.  E.g. write a function that takes a column index and outputs the nth column name in Excel.
[17:01:46] <jjuran> So 26 -> "Z", 27 -> "AA", etc.
[17:02:08] <Brekkjern> That is a nice and simple question IMO
[17:02:23] <Brekkjern> And it shows that you have a decent command of a programming language
[17:02:34] <Geekingfrog> Agree
[17:03:15] <Brekkjern> And there are probably a few ways to do it that all are somewhat valid
[17:05:47] <gerikson> I dunno the rules for the column name tho
[17:05:56] <gerikson> never had to go past column N or so :D
[17:06:15] <gerikson> but I guess if you're interviewing for the job you need to
[17:07:51] <jjuran> They're happy to explain the naming rule.  You just need to implement it :-)
[17:10:44] <gerikson> something something mod 26
[17:11:08] <gerikson> but yeah that is a good interview quesdtion
[17:11:19] <riv> i found out that fizzbuzz isn't as contrived as thought
[17:12:09] <gerikson> it's a legit kid's game, no?
[17:12:12] <riv> suppose you have a recurring timer every 1ms and want to trigger events from a table like the fizz event wants to happen every 3ms, buzz every 5ms
[17:15:42] <jjuran> gerikson: Yes, but it's not quite base26.
[17:16:49] <riv> hm how is it different to base 26?
[17:16:57] <riv> because there's no 0 digit?
[17:17:36] <jjuran> Because each column starts empty, but once it cycles through A-Z it goes back to A.
[17:18:15] <jjuran> It's like if the successor to 9 were 11.
[17:18:31] <riv> ah!
[17:18:36] <riv> that is quite interesting
[17:20:07] <gthm> jjuran: wait, isn't the progression A B ... Z AA AB AC ... AZ BA BB ... ?
[17:20:30] <jjuran> gthm: yes
[17:20:33] <riv> if it was digits, 0 1 2 00 01
[17:20:40] <jjuran> nope
[17:20:43] <riv> so its different than numbers
[17:21:05] <jjuran> 0 1 2 is the same as 00 01 02
[17:22:51] <jjuran> It's a sort of hybrid base26/base27
[17:23:09] <gerikson> forget it Jim, it's Chinatown
[17:24:02] <jjuran> I have my complaints about working at MS, but the interview process isn't among them
[17:24:12] <riv> among us
[17:24:16] <Brekkjern> It is just base 26. The alphabet is 26 characters long and the 0th element is the A
[17:24:29] <riv> Brekkjern: i just showed how its different to base 26 though
[17:24:30] <jjuran> Nope.  "A" != "AA"
[17:24:55] <Brekkjern> Oh, you mean like that
[17:24:56] <jjuran> In case it wasn't clear, I no longer work there
[17:24:59] <riv> it's because there's no special 0 digit
[17:25:12] <Brekkjern> Well, eh. I was working this problem one letter at a time
[17:25:52] <Brekkjern> My idea was a while loop that worked down the numbers by modulo or something like that
[17:27:14] <jjuran> Good idea :-)
[17:27:50] <jjuran> Heh, I should code this up for old times' sake
[17:27:57] <Brekkjern> Problems like that are fun
[17:28:13] <Brekkjern> The one I had for this job was a lot of fun :)
[17:28:27] <Brekkjern> Like, I wrote a library to do parts of it afterwards because it's neat.

[17:29:48] <Brekkjern> I gotta agree with Adam Ragusea on this
[17:30:02] <Brekkjern> Chicken and duck are better birds
[17:31:46] <gwozniak> I agree. Turkey is overrated
[17:31:58] <gerikson> I prefer Armenia...
[17:32:01] <gerikson> ;)
[17:32:15] <Brekkjern> I got a soft spot for greek
[17:32:21] <gwozniak> Love Greece in my cooking
[17:34:25] <gwozniak> Oh nice. The password reset website I'm supposed to use to change my password doesn't work
[17:43:12] <jjuran> Mediterranean cuisine is all Greek to me
[17:45:11] <gwozniak> But the password reset site works when on VPN
[17:45:36] <gwozniak> The point to the site being, of course, that you need to be able to use when you can't get access to the VPN...
[17:47:48] <gwozniak> I greatly dislike this "you much change your password every X days" policy
[17:52:16] <Xe> it's outdated
[17:56:47] <gwozniak> We have 2FA. I think the password change thing is someone being overly cautious because "more policies == better security"
[17:57:07] <edk> was there a time when regular password changes did make sense?
[17:57:16] <gwozniak> Yeah, there was
[17:58:27] <gwozniak> This password policy was instituted around the same time the 2FA stuff was. The problem, I suspect, was that there wasn't much done from a secuity perspective before, there was an incident, and then there was overcompensation
[17:59:34] <edk> i can't find any justification for the regular password changes except that if someone does have a compromised password it'll eventually stop working
[17:59:37] <edk> which seems laughable
[18:00:11] <riv> i hate password security stuff
[18:00:17] <gwozniak> Pretty much everyone embeds a counter in their password and just ups the count by one when a new one has to be used
[18:01:01] <gwozniak> Because there's no way I'm memorizing some new, random string every few months
[18:01:39] * gwozniak goes about logging in to all the sites again...
[18:01:59] <jjuran> I hate requiring different categories of symbols (in an effort to increase entropy) regardless of how long the password is — especially on mobile devices with virtual keyboards, where most anything but letters is a nuisance.
[18:02:36] <jjuran> *lowercase
[18:03:01] <edk> it's hard to measure entropy

[18:03:33] <buttsbot> xkcd: Password Strength
[18:03:44] <edk> and the waters are muddied by all the people who don't understand why xkcd 936 works
[18:05:54] <ngoldbaum> so i just need to make my password “correct horse battery staple” check
[18:06:35] <prussian> My favorite is when you have to change the password and then the password changing thing tells you your new password is too much like your old password.
[18:06:36] <ngoldbaum> nickserv identify hunter2correcthorsebatterystaple
[18:06:56] <edk> i remain disappointed that mostsecure.pw is no longer online
[18:07:02] <jjuran> All I see is *******correcthorsebatterystaple
[18:07:05] <gwozniak> prussian: the system here remembers the past 10 passwords :/
[18:07:18] <edk> telling IT i'd set my password to it was a treasured pastime
[18:07:19] <epilys> in hashes, right?
[18:07:22] <epilys> right??
[18:07:25] <prussian>  Nice...
[18:07:36] <gwozniak> I'm assuming it's hashes. I have no insight into this stuff
[18:07:45] <prussian> epilys: ya but how can you levenstein distance a hash?
[18:08:03] <gwozniak> At least they don't use the PHP hash
[18:08:03] <edk> well, you can hash pieces of a password, which is only slightly less terrible than storing it in plaintext
[18:08:06] <epilys> you can't unless it's perceptual hash?
[18:08:09] <jjuran> Generate all the too-close matches and hash them?
[18:08:20] <edk> a perceptual hash is also no good for security
[18:08:25] <epilys> exactly
[18:08:29] <Geekingfrog> At a previous job we had a 3rd party which required to rotate the password every month, and was remembering the last 10 password. So we created a cron job to rotate the password 10 times, and change it one last time to its original value
[18:08:55] <jjuran> womp womp
[18:09:04] <gwozniak> Geekingfrog: the system here disallows password changes for one day after changing it
[18:09:10] <Geekingfrog> damn
[18:09:11] <prussian> Maybe if you could tweak a hash to not have an avalanche effect, but that might effectively be the same problem
[18:09:13] <edk> you can generate all the strings within an edit distance, but that's a lot of strings, so at a minimum your hash function is going to need to be a lot faster than it could be otherwise
[18:09:15] <epilys> I have a password manager but for passwords I need to remember like my bank password, I just append a power of two and multiply it with two everytime it asks me to renew it
[18:09:19] <Geekingfrog> 10 days of downtime for the service in this case :/
[18:09:21] <gwozniak> I mean... just use 2FA... which we already do
[18:09:37] <prussian> jjuran: that idea makes some sense.
[18:09:38] <edk> well the avalanche effect is why hashes work at all for this i think
[18:09:39] <prussian> But idk
[18:09:43] <prussian> Ya
[18:10:17] <prussian> Hate passwords. Simple as that.
[18:10:34] <edk> they are pretty terrible in general, yeah
[18:10:44] <edk> but everything else has worse problems
[18:10:48] <prussian> We should just all get java cards or whatever.
[18:10:49] <epilys> I implemented signing in with SSH OTPs in a website
[18:10:52] <prussian> For everything
[18:10:55] <epilys> logging in *
[18:10:57] <gwozniak> Not so much that I hate passwords, but password management polices? Yeah
[18:10:58] <prussian> epilys: nice

[18:11:09] <buttsbot> You can now login with SSH one time passwords - sic
[18:11:13] <edk> gwozniak: well, passwords in general are pretty awful
[18:11:31] <gwozniak> edk: yes, but like you say, other things are worse
[18:11:35] <prussian> That's actually a good idea...
[18:12:11] <riv> if passwords are so great why isnt there password2!#A
[18:12:20] <edk> if you're providing a service that people can log in to you have to worry about keeping them secure, which is tedious and annoying, and making sure less savvy users don't give theirs to people, which is impossible, and correctly identifying users who have forgotten theirs
[18:12:56] <edk> i don't want everyone to have to use government-issued ID to log in to things, but it would make my life easier
[18:13:16] <gwozniak> Inevitably, those things get damaged or lost, too
[18:13:28] <gwozniak> Or stolen, etc.
[18:13:34] <prussian> Man. Speaking of "lusers" I still see people blindly type "yes" when encountering an ssh host key they have not verified
[18:13:49] <edk> gwozniak: yes, but implemented correctly it would be the government's problem to identify and fix that
[18:14:08] <edk> prussian: yeah, it's disappointing
[18:14:36] <gwozniak> prussian: I have never checked such things, mainly because I'm always doing something internal and no one really knows what the host key is anyway
[18:14:47] <jjuran> When I rooted my oldest Android phone, I wrote a su that issues a public-key-based cryptographic challenge and provides a root shell given the correct response.
[18:14:48] <edk> my work can't be bothered to set up certificates or just distribute host keys
[18:14:53] <epilys> speaking of ssh fingerprints, this is how ssh used to generate those ascii art fingerprints https://www.jfurness.uk/the-drunken-bishop-algorithm/
[18:14:54] <buttsbot> The Drunken Bishop Algorithm – Barely Functional Theories
[18:15:36] <jjuran> So the phone doesn't even know the private key that unlocks root, only the public key to check
[18:15:50] <edk> it's really easy if you have any kind of central management thing to just make it teach all the machines each other's host keys
[18:16:21] <jjuran> prussian: That's a UI problem.  SSH makes it a nuisance to check.
[18:16:37] <edk> i'm not sure how ssh can make it easier
[18:16:50] <jjuran> By which I mean SSH doesn't print the actual instructions when asking you yes/no
[18:17:07] <edk> what instructions though
[18:17:17] <edk> there's no standard way to bootstrap trust
[18:17:25] <gwozniak> "Contact your local BOFH"
[18:17:30] <prussian> Honestly, having X509 and just blindly trusting the CAs we have would be better.
[18:17:32] <epilys> call your IT and read the fingerprint letter by letter
[18:17:51] <prussian> But it's whatever. I use signed host keys at work.
[18:18:12] <prussian> epilys: so true
[18:18:35] <edk> or IT could just put their known_hosts on your machine
[18:19:18] <prussian> True.
[18:20:02] <edk> i don't think ssh should just use and trust the web pki. it's already incredibly easy to solve this problem, people just don't bother
[18:20:56] <prussian> I think having the option would help a lot for most users though.
[18:21:59] <edk> i doubt it's relevant to most users
[18:23:09] <edk> if you use ssh in a corporate environment you can use whatever your corporate environment provides. if you use ssh for personal stuff, you probably just sshed into a thing once and then it's in your known_hosts and it will stay there forever
[18:27:26] <prussian> Cool.... openssh's certificate code doesn't support chaining.

[23:33:10] <epilys> "...begun questioning the sustainability of Axie’s economy, which largely relies on new player growth to remain in balance." This sounds like some sort of scheme that you could say looks like a pyramid when visualised

[23:55:32] <gwozniak> I read it and felt like a big puff piece.  The basic message ("keep at it to get better at it") is fine.  The filler was just... filler.
