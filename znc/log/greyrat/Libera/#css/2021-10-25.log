[00:22:43] <ThePhilgrim> Hey, I'm working with the nav for my portfolio website, and I am having some problems when trying to create a wrapper class. As is right now, the markup/css works fine. However, if I try to wrap the logo & nav ul in my .wrapper class, the logo & nav end up on separate rows. Really cannot figure out why. Codepen: https://codepen.io/thephilgrim/pen/abypXby
[00:23:48] <ThePhilgrim> I'm trying to put the .wrapper on row 4, under '<nav class="primary-nav">'
[00:25:54] <pyra> ThePhilgrim: usually with that kind of thing the first thing to try is display: inline-block for the elements
[00:25:59] <pyra> or flex
[00:26:10] <pyra> flex is the best thing since slices bread

[00:44:50] <ThePhilgrim> Hmm, but I was hoping to make the wrapper class something that I can reuse throughout the website to contain everything with a max-width. When adding a bunch of things, it's no longer reusable
[00:46:06] <ThePhilgrim> Ah, but now you made me understand what's going on. By adding the wrapper, the nav is no longer the direct parent of the menu elements. Which means that they are no longer affected by the display: flex

[01:52:58] <hmw[at]> Wafficus: You can put that transparent element in front of others, and use pointer-events:none; to make the clicks go through
[01:53:04] <Wafficus> I'm picking images at random
[01:53:05] <Wafficus> that's why
[01:53:15] <matsaman> mmm, fair enough
[01:53:35] <Wafficus> how would I put the transparent element in front?
[01:53:36] <matsaman> anyway, using z-index would be pretty ordinary
[01:53:39] <Wafficus> should it be the last image on the page?
[01:53:47] <matsaman> it doesn't matter where it is, really

[01:55:39] <matsaman> #page_background
[01:56:29] <Wafficus> right, so add 'pointer-events: none;' to the '#page_background' element, got it
[01:56:30] <matsaman> Wafficus: try: #page_background { z-index: -1; }
[01:56:31] <Wafficus> i'll try that
[01:56:51] <matsaman> wouldn't use pointer-events for this, personally
[01:57:31] <Wafficus> sweet that works
[01:57:35] <Wafficus> thanks for the z-index
[01:57:36] <matsaman> z-index is what one uses for controlling the z-axis stack
[01:57:41] <hmw[at]> matsaman: I didn't look at the page, it depends. If you want to blur out what's in the background, you'd need pointer events, right
[01:57:43] <Wafficus> cool, didn't know there's 3D style ideas in CSS styling
[01:57:48] <matsaman> (as long as the requisite 'position' is used)
[01:58:02] <matsaman> hmw[at]: everything depends, sure =)
[01:58:39] <hmw[at]> Also, z-index:-1 can make an element disappear, when the foreground elements have a background color
[01:58:52] <hmw[at]> Just mentioning that in case it happens to one of you
[01:59:22] <hmw[at]> For some reason, using positive z values never lead to that effect for me

[02:21:30] <Wafficus> random CSS question but is there a way for a background-color to be dark or light themed depending on the 'color' text present?
[02:21:40] <Wafficus> is there an '@' condition for this kind of behavior?
[02:22:22] <hmw[at]> Wafficus: You might be able to use filters, but it isn't usually done. You can use @something queries to check, if the user has set dark mode in their OS though
[02:22:45] <Wafficus> I wonder if there's a CSS way to determine how dark a color is
[02:22:52] <Wafficus> or at least to determine it from the color code itself
[02:22:54] <hmw[at]> Wafficus: it is good practice to specifically set color and background whenever you need one
[02:23:07] <Wafficus> reason being is that I like randomness and my site runs on random color schemes
[02:23:13] <hmw[at]> nope, no way to "calculate" if a color is "dark" in css.
[02:23:20] <Wafficus> so to have this in tandom to make the text color white or black would be awesome
[02:23:27] <Wafficus> might have to find a Python 3 package that could do this
[02:23:30] <Wafficus> *tandem
[02:23:50] <hmw[at]> Wafficus: You could assign a class to your <body> like class="random_style_1" and change that 1 via javascript, and then use CSS to create a variation of color schemes
[02:25:12] <hmw[at]> Wafficus: You could perhaps use filter:color-rotate(). Set a base color scheme and "rotate" the colors around with a random value. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter
[02:25:36] <Wafficus> yeah my site creates the CSS sheet at random
[02:25:44] <Wafficus> so I have a bit more fine grained control over it interestingly enough
[02:25:49] <Wafficus> that CSS 3D demo shared earlier was neat
[02:25:55] <hmw[at]> body style="filter:color-rotate(random value here)"
[02:26:05] <Wafficus> I skimmed it, but yeah man, some people are just smart enough to make a mountain out of a mole hill, neat stuff dude
[02:26:20] <hmw[at]> css is pretty neat, and almost turing complete

[02:33:18] <matsaman> desktop OSes can do the same thing
[02:33:30] <matsaman> you start providing multiple themes and you only multiply the problem
[02:33:33] <Wafficus> which is really a BSD derivative
[02:33:50] <matsaman> color choice is an accessibility thing, it's the end user's / OS's problem
[02:34:47] <matsaman> there's always going to be somebody who doesn't like the colors you've chosen, light or dark
[02:34:51] <hmw[at]> I'd set css variables according to prefers-color-scheme and use them in the rest of the styles. Not a lot of effort tbh

[02:37:01] <matsaman> desktop schemes are dumb
[02:37:11] <hmw[at]> how else could I set "dark mode" then
[02:37:13] <matsaman> color inversion is the simple solution
[02:37:13] *** Joins: jetchisel (jetchisel@user/jetchisel)
[02:37:29] <matsaman> if you don't like the non-black hues, then you color invert and hue shift
[02:37:36] <matsaman> if you don't like inverted images, then you don't invert images alone
[02:38:02] <matsaman> if you can't stand any of that, there are browser extensions like dark mode or whatever
[02:38:19] <matsaman> all of those are more appropriate solutions than website creators making endless redundant themes

[02:38:34] <matsaman> I mean I won't

[02:39:04] <hmw[at]> people won't even change colors at all, they expect things to work out of the box, and if they aren't they find a better web site
[02:39:22] <matsaman> well, at a certain point OSes will shift to "dark mode" out of the box / by default
[02:39:25] <matsaman> and that's what it'll do
[02:39:39] <matsaman> it'll invert colors, shift hue, and probably not invert images
[02:40:04] <matsaman> but they need to reduce blue light optionally separately =P
[02:40:14] <matsaman> iOS is silly about this, it'll invert colors but breaks blue light reduction =P

[04:43:57] <oksushi> carlino3: you’ll likely need to do something like this https://jsfiddle.net/gq8ra5zx/
[04:44:17] <carlino3> well, 15px of horizontal padding does the trick but i'm testing with different bar sizes
[04:44:48] <oksushi> essentially, because it’s skewed — the original box is where it was originally, the displayed box breaks out to the left and right
[04:44:53] <oksushi> I’ve changed the transform-origin to bottom left, then added some right padding on the container – which is a hack
[04:45:03] <carlino3> that looks better

[04:45:21] <carlino3> but how much right padding to always fit content?
[04:45:29] <oksushi> exactly
[04:48:04] <hmw[at]> https://www.zdnet.com/article/css-to-get-support-for-trigonometry-functions/
[04:48:06] <carlino3> i think that some trigonometry can do the trick with calc() here
[04:50:35] <hmw[at]> "Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail. Those programs which cannot so expand are replaced by ones which can.
[04:53:41] <carlino3> hmw[at] i don't understand
[04:53:52] <carlino3> what is that supposed to mean?
[04:54:08] <hmw[at]> People on the web complaining about "unneeded" features, like trig functions. They say they can't wait to do their protein folding in CSS
[04:55:10] <hmw[at]> According to that rule, we'll be sending and receiving email with CSS soon :)
[04:55:20] <oksushi> or playing DOOM
[04:55:32] <hmw[at]> I think we already are there, oksushi heheh
[04:56:38] <hmw[at]> "Can it play DOOM" seems to be a meme, that I missed somehow for a while. My C64 can play it now, too.
[04:58:35] <hmw[at]> "DOOM Rendered via Checkboxes" you wot?
[04:58:58] <hmw[at]> "TempleOS now runs Doom!" rofl
[05:02:16] <carlino3> so are you suggesting that i should use images instead of pure css for this? or i understood it wrong
[05:02:37] <hmw[at]> Yes. Upload .bmp files. HTML is bloat.
[05:03:48] <hmw[at]> Seriously; Some switch that lets us have those transformed things contained in a parent would be nice.
[05:04:20] <hmw[at]> Something like border-box considering the transformed outcome
[05:04:55] <hmw[at]> Using a little trigonometry won't hurt though, I guess. I am certainly not claiming that those are bad
[05:07:33] <hmw[at]> otoh, rendering engines are already insanley complex

[10:25:36] <moniker-> hey any other useful channels for learning webdev on this network that come to mind?
[10:25:55] <moniker-> so far i'm visiting #webdev and now recently discovered this channel
[10:26:49] <thykka> #javascript maybe
[10:47:29] <moniker-> understandable... haven't gotten to javascript yet, just learning html and css as of now
[10:47:48] <moniker-> if anything else comes to mind do let me know
[11:00:28] *** Joins: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky)
[11:08:18] <hmw[at]> moniker-: Use MDN as a reference, avoid w3schools. Read the w3 specifications for HTML and CSS (this will take you a while). Create test cases for various CSS things and keep them in a folder for re-use.
[11:08:49] <hmw[at]> `divitis @ moniker-
[11:08:49] <Selvvir> moniker-, Divitis is when you use tons of <div>s when you don't have to. Create the HTML for the page first, THEN style it. The fewer elements you have, the fewer problems you have.
[11:09:37] <moniker-> thx i am using mdn yes it is the best, although w3schools have corrected many flaws they had in the past so i think it's mostly bad reputation that follows them and not that you would make a huge mistake if you use them today
[11:10:10] <hmw[at]> I still see mistakes there but yes, they allegedly improved. I still don't like to see them earning money :)
[11:10:58] <hmw[at]> The bot has a funny factlet about them, although as mentioned, it might be outdated
[11:11:00] <moniker-> but if they are working at improving and correcting their flaws and you dont perceive them being totally bad faith actors deceitful and mean then i see no justifiable reason for this strong stance towards them
[11:11:01] <hmw[at]> `w3schools
[11:11:01] <Selvvir> hmw[at], W3Schools: errors, omissions, deceit. They are *not* affiliated with the W3C. Please stop reading/pointing to them! See http://w3fools.com/.
[11:11:21] <hmw[at]> I see them as bad faith actors, they are just greedy weirdos
[11:11:34] <moniker-> if that's how you see them then yes that would be justifiable
[11:12:01] <hmw[at]> We tried for many years to make them clean up their act
[11:12:17] <hmw[at]> Also, I recently saw a mistake there. Sure, nobody is perfect.
[11:12:29] <hmw[at]> Guess I have a grudge lol
[11:13:34] <moniker-> i think most people do that's why im a bit cautious trying to inject a bit of compassion, although who knows given enough time i may become the one shouting dont use w3schools myself
[11:14:23] <moniker-> bad reputation is tough to get rid of
[11:14:37] <hmw[at]> moniker-: css-tricks is also a good page, they have nice overviews/tutorials for various CSS topics
[11:14:40] <moniker-> and often justifiably so
[11:15:23] <moniker-> kk
[11:15:42] <hmw[at]> moniker-: Also, using CSS can be hard, especially for beginners. It's not always obvious how to do a certain thing. It will help, if one looks at the historical evolution of CSS to see why things were added
[11:16:34] <moniker-> heh, you can say that again. Im doing this bootcamp on html and css and it's so basic that when i actually inspect pages out there in real world i dont understand a thing because of complexity that will take time to settle
[11:16:35] <hmw[at]> Finally, stick around here and try to help others (if you thing you can). That gives you a lot of opportinity to practice your webdev-foo
[11:16:50] <hmw[at]> think*
[11:17:40] <hmw[at]> moniker-: Picture my relief, when I first found out about that inspector function. Before that, I had to use my own brain!!
[11:18:19] <hmw[at]> It was in this very channel. I was surprised how some people could figure out a problem so quickly. They told me about firebug. What a godsent. Now all browsers have decent debuggers.
[11:19:23] <moniker-> how is firebug different from lets say dev tools in chrome
[11:19:25] <hmw[at]> moniker-: Frameworks make pages insanely hard to debug. Sometimes my script blocker says 150+ scripts blocked. You wot mate?
[11:19:42] <hmw[at]> Firebug was before browsers had inspectors, and it was essentially the same thing
[11:19:53] <moniker-> i'm aware of it that much
[11:20:01] <moniker-> but today, how is it different? is it?
[11:20:11] <hmw[at]> Firebug is obsolete
[11:20:18] <moniker-> oh right
[11:20:33] <moniker-> it was proto of waht devtools became over time, i get you
[11:20:42] <hmw[at]> Browser addon for FF
[11:20:47] <moniker-> ye ye i get it
[11:20:58] <moniker-> but when you mentioned it now i got impression someone is still using it
[11:21:44] <hmw[at]> https://getfirebug.com/
[11:22:44] <hmw[at]> Sounds like FF incorporated FBug and made it into the current devtools?
[11:22:45] <hmw[at]> Nice
[11:22:58] <moniker-> speaking of resources, are there good youtube channels that teach this stuff with good real world examples?
[11:23:20] <hmw[at]> I don't like videos for such things, so I unfortunately don't know
[11:23:28] <moniker-> kk
[11:23:41] <hmw[at]> I also don't know a really good ressource for starters, either
[11:24:18] <hmw[at]> I will happily give you hints every now and then and try to guide you on your journey. Most people in this channel will.
[11:24:40] <moniker-> thx
[11:24:50] <hmw[at]> I have tried to write introductions, but failed so far heheh
[11:25:00] <hmw[at]> I would have a few things to tell. Perhaps I should try again.
[11:26:19] <hmw[at]> A few links for you, moniker-  :

[11:27:09] <hmw[at]> https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ <-- they used to have a TON of excellent articles. I recommend, you go dig into their web site deeply
[11:27:18] <hmw[at]> Heheh
[11:27:50] <hmw[at]> I used to use hmw for years, but there is another user also using it. When you don't log in for 6 months, you can ask the ops to free a registered nick and overtake it. ...
[11:28:06] <moniker-> i see, so jsut part of your nick
[11:28:22] <hmw[at]> So, over the course of several years, me and the other html fought over the nick, it went back and forth a few times. I then decided to find a new one.  at is for Austria.
[11:28:34] <hmw[at]> s/html/hmw
[11:28:42] <hmw[at]> muscle memory kicked in at the wrong time lol
[11:29:37] <moniker-> alright thx for all the links and tips so far, ill move on cause i have others things to attend to, like my bootcamp class, laters!
[11:29:50] <hmw[at]> Have fun!

[23:50:28] <hmw[at]> `testcase @ hansol
[23:50:28] <Selvvir> hansol, a (pared-down) testcase is a page that isolates the problem with the minimum required markup, styling and scripting. See `paste for services that easily let you create such testcases for others to see.
[23:50:36] <hmw[at]> `live @ hansol
[23:50:36] <Selvvir> hansol, Please provide a live page or a working demonstration of your problem to make it possible to debug. If it's local or private, copy your HTML and CSS into a `testcase in a `paste server like http://jsfiddle.net or http://codepen.io. Screenshots and plain text code pastes are difficult to debug.
[23:51:08] <hansol> what to provide
[23:51:14] <hansol> i have tell you the problem
[23:51:50] <hmw[at]> hansol: Try white-space:nowrap; but you may have too little room
[23:52:24] <hmw[at]> hansol: Usually we like to get a link to a real page, so we can use the inspector tools
[23:52:49] <hmw[at]> Without, I can only guess what might solve your issue
[23:52:59] <hansol> its on local machine
