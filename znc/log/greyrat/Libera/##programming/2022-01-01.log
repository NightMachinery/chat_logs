[00:23:33] <InPhase> mrig: I have a bunch of multithreaded programs I've written with a main management thread that centralizes control, coordinates activities of other threads, and serves the role of choosing when to pass information onto other threads in parts of the program.  This main management thread serves a comparable role to consciousness in humans and animals.  So I'm not sure that just looking for 
[00:23:39] <InPhase> "consciousness" is by itself meaningful without trying to figure out what kind we are considering meaningful.

[00:27:00] <mrig> InPhase:  sure yes, there are all sorts of metrics that we might consider, I personally think that consciousness is a field that is interlinked between entities; The self awareness aspect really is only the skin on the top.

[00:30:32] <InPhase> mrig: Self-awareness is also a sort of thing that's hard to pin down what we actually mean.  My main management objects often hand out pointers and references to themselves, and analyze and validate their own state, along with examining status in the other parts of the "self" program, so does that count as self-awareness?

[00:32:12] <InPhase> I've often thought that a distinguishing characteristic of human self-awareness involves generalized abstract modeling of other things being reflected back as generalized abstract modeling of the self as an entity.  Hence, a sort of learning about the structure and nature of the self by observing the self and thus forming an abstract model of it.

[00:35:04] <jacekowski> i would say self awarness requires learning on top of just being able to act on its own state
[00:35:19] <InPhase> And likewise, no program would be capable of it unless it, in an unsupervised manner, can observe a problem and invent a tool to solve that problem.

[01:30:30] <jjido> InPhase do you know about functional reactive programming?
[01:31:56] <InPhase> jjido: Yeah, it is often used with a purism that I find unsuitable, and a syntax that I find unhelpful.
[01:32:17] <InPhase> jjido: Although it has concepts that can be useful in a different structure.

[03:15:38] <nitrix> The usage of the collection would drive the evaluation, which would drive the execution, which would drive the mutations. So if you have non-deterministic code that sometimes access elements and sometimes doesn't, you affect future operations, including the very accesses that drives the whole thing.

[04:12:18] <InPhase> nomagno: I think floats, or more often doubles, are extremely useful, and I use them about as often as integer types.  Although I do a lot of numerical calculations in my programming, so this is a natural result of that.  With vectorization, many operations on doubles can end up very fast, to the point where they are sometimes faster than integer calculations.  It requires one to rethink old

[05:47:31] <apotheon> I would not want to have to secure the server allowing arbitrary SSH commands.
[05:47:32] <nomagno> A LOT
[05:47:51] <apotheon> a lot
[05:48:03] <apotheon> and a lot of latency, probably
[05:48:31] <apotheon> An SSH tunnel could be used to handle API requests reasonably well, though.
[05:48:36] <pikapika> MsEmilyFox, its a very obscure solution. I think if you wanted a webapp with more or less inbuilt tech, I would say try the cgi
[05:48:49] <nomagno> A lot of latency, a lot of overhead, you lose the possibility to implement QUIC or whatever other fancy transport layers people use nowadays...
[05:48:53] <apotheon> So . . . here's the thing:
[05:49:36] <apotheon> If you limit the commands available over SSH, and the point is to be able to get at data via SSH, the set of available commands *is an API*.
[05:49:50] <EdFletcher> Using docker with separate user accounts and ssh access is just creating a shitty, less-secure VM 🤣

[05:49:57] <MsEmilyFox> yes apotheon you *get it*
[05:50:11] <EdFletcher> If you want a VM, use a VM. 
[05:50:29] <MsEmilyFox> a limited set of ssh commands IS already an API
[05:50:32] <pikapika> well I think that kind of thing would be more suited for things where the answer is big and accessed only occasionally
[05:50:51] <nomagno> You want to move the API to behind an ssh interface to a Linux container, when you could just do something as simple as a POST request and get the binary data back?
[05:50:54] <pikapika> a normal api relating to web pages would be too slow if done that way
[05:51:15] <pikapika> for example something like give me map data for so and so coordinates region etc
[05:51:20] <pikapika> the answer is a large file

[05:57:05] <pikapika> so if there is a long chain of functions that expect callbacks instead of a normal sequence of statements you get a nested group of callback fns

[06:02:17] <pikapika> If we remove ASI, make the type conversions more sane and do away with this async by default nonsense its a pleasant lang

[06:03:18] <pikapika> EdFletcher, it is indeed
[06:03:21] <EdFletcher> Perfectly said. 
[06:03:25] <pikapika> I feel very "bipolar" about js

[06:04:11] <EdFletcher> True but every language has its warts. JS just has a lot because it’s aged. 
[06:04:28] <pikapika> EdFletcher, yeah but like its funny how "bipolar" js is
[06:04:35] <pikapika> All languages have their pluses and minuses
[06:04:57] <EdFletcher> pikapika: Oh it absolutely is, also self-contradictory at times 
[06:05:01] <pikapika> but generally the "signed difference" between then is not much and it stays in some overall average region
[06:05:33] <pikapika> whereas in js its like many things are really erally pleasant, and many things are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction
[06:05:45] <pikapika> so the average is somewhere near medium but somehow its "spread" is quite large
[06:05:48] <pikapika> if you get what I mean
[06:05:57] <EdFletcher> Haha absolutely 
[06:06:30] <pikapika> Its like C features are say +1,+4,+10,-3,-4; etc whereas js its like -50, +60 etc

[06:08:10] <EdFletcher> ThePhilgrim: The callback is just a regular function, but the function you passed it to is not doing anything with its return value so you’re in the situation you’re in. A promise is indeed the way to wrap that up asynchronously!

[06:09:16] <EdFletcher> But yeah like pikapika is saying, some APIs expect callbacks to return a value synchronously (like Array’s map, reduce, filter, etc.) 
[06:09:46] <pikapika> EdFletcher, yes of course in case of those array prcoessing tools the function passed isn't really a callback though

[06:12:58] <ThePhilgrim> Brain has already shut off
[06:13:00] <pikapika> ThePhilgrim, basically
[06:13:10] <pikapika> a callback fn is just an fn you pass to some function
[06:13:15] <pikapika> lets say the outer fn is P
[06:13:19] <pikapika> and your callback is C
[06:13:43] <pikapika> you call P(other args,...,C)
[06:13:47] <pikapika> what P would do is
[06:13:55] <ThePhilgrim> yeah
[06:13:57] <ThePhilgrim> this makes sense
[06:13:59] <fffaulty> happy new years boys and girls

[06:14:35] <ThePhilgrim> Okay, and in my case, P only calls C.. there is no other code

[06:15:22] <pikapika> its a very simple concept
[06:15:36] <ThePhilgrim> Yeah, but I don't understand why I can't return something from C
[06:15:44] <ThePhilgrim> Doesn't exactly make sense to me
[06:15:44] <pikapika> so how to define C and where control goes after P is called all depends on the structure of P
[06:16:01] <pikapika> for example if C is the last fn called inside P with no operation after it
[06:16:13] <InPhase> MsEmilyFox: And why do you think that grabbing the data by RSS or Atom is not a REST API?
[06:16:15] <pikapika> then the next statement after your call for P is the same as the last statement inside C

[06:18:33] <EdFletcher> ThePhilgrim: Because as I already said, the readdir function is ignoring the return value of your callback. It’s not how this API works, to capture that. 
[06:18:39] <pikapika> you can't do anything unless you can change P
[06:18:48] <pikapika> if P is an opaque library function you are not in charge of that
[06:18:55] <pikapika> EdFletcher, exactly
[06:19:31] <MsEmilyFox> InPhase: RSS just grabs data. REST API has all this built in shit / verbs for every behaviour that the original designer thought might make sense at the time but actually creates unnecessary waste for such a simple application
[06:19:33] <pikapika> ThePhilgrim, "C" is simply a normal function called inside the body of P

[06:21:16] <ThePhilgrim> hm, right
[06:21:31] <pikapika> the return value from C() as seen in that statement is just ignored because C is not meant to be a function that returns anything
[06:21:33] <InPhase> MsEmilyFox: I don't see any requirement that you need to use all capabilities of a REST API to be a REST API, only that you need to use the parts applicable to the problem.
[06:21:35] <ThePhilgrim> But in my case, C is the library function? :S
[06:21:37] <ThePhilgrim> fs.readdir

[09:48:46] <duuude> is it that much of a deal? at worst you'd see a comment and not the corresponding code, so you'd remove or disregard it. 
[09:49:22] <duuude> but too much comments could save a lot of time when depuzzling how does a big piece of code works
[09:49:49] <vdamewood> Nope. It's a big deal. If your comments are wrong, you could come back to it later, assume you're right, and not notice the comments are wrong.
[09:51:07] <vdamewood> My usage of comments depends on how much information I can encode in my choice of variable/function/class/struct names. In assembly, the text is 20% code, 80% comments. In C++, Java, Python, et al. The text is 95% code, 5% comments.
[09:52:18] <duuude> well you remove the comment then? also such confusion could happen with code as well.
[09:52:47] <InPhase> duuude: That's why you put comments next to the code, so you can try to remember to fix it up at the same time.  Sometimes you make a mistake, but you know, try not to.
[09:53:07] *** Quits: mishugana (~mishugana@user/mishugana) (Quit: leaving)
[09:53:34] <InPhase> duuude: This problem is minimized if you reserve comments for things that actually need them, like confusing stretches of code, or documenting interfaces.  And instead focus a lot of effort on making self-explanatory code that does exactly what it says on the label.

[09:56:08] <InPhase> duuude: It only helps if they are good selective comments at the right places.  You can also dive into a codebase that's just flooded with useless comments, and this does not help at all.
[09:57:11] <InPhase> duuude: Well there's no single recipe for getting it right.  It's a bit of a communicative art.
[09:57:56] <duuude> Also a lot of small functions and this sort of dividing stuff works to some extent, but after that it distributes code in too many places and it would a pain to scroll up and down and find everything to see what is wrong

[09:58:07] <InPhase> duuude: But as it's communication, it's best to think of the intended audience, and what pieces of code they will find clear at a glance, and what they won't.  And try really hard to make as much as possible clear at a glance to that audience.
[09:58:08] <duuude> i.e. The problem is always somewhere else

[10:00:36] <duuude> Well I am just saying comments are better way for that
[10:00:57] <InPhase> It's not really, because comments don't come with clean interfaces.
[10:01:54] <InPhase> "The thing I sent in looked okay, but the thing I got back does not" tells you a lot more than "I got here and something was wrong".
[10:02:22] <duuude> It keeps it a single continous piece of text, also you are less limited when writing comments than when writing identifiers. You can make proper sentences, as long as you want.
[10:03:00] <duuude> You may want to repeat the identifier, when it becomes too long it becomes a nuisance
[10:03:20] *** Joins: tomathy (~jenova@user/quetzl)
[10:03:28] <InPhase> You can, but that length slows down the reader.  It's worth investing time in each section of code about what the critical label is for it.  This will keep your mind grounded on segmented debuggable behavior as you go along.
[10:03:36] *** Joins: rsonx (~lost_leve@user/rsonx)
[10:04:08] <InPhase> If it's too complicated to label, consider breaking apart the behavior or restructuring to something you CAN label.  This will usually help everything else arrange nicer.
[10:04:26] <MsEmilyFox> ok I have a question
[10:05:49] <duuude> Well I am not arguing for like functions 200 300 lines long. Rather for 20-50 lines doing one thing that if divided, would be mostly single-use functions.
[10:06:05] <KillerWasp> mupen64plus is SHIT!!!
[10:06:07] <MsEmilyFox> let's say a new language came out tomorrow. if I could google around and find the grammar for that language (if it were published) I assume I could make my own parser for it. what are the high level steps I'd have to practically go through to turn that into a minimalist parser (one that produced the AST for any statement in the language and could
[10:06:07] <MsEmilyFox> turn a file into a sequence of ASTs)

[10:07:33] <rsonx> yeah but it cannot do analog on keyboard.
[10:07:36] <InPhase> duuude: There's definitely a place for the 20-50 line functions, especially if they're doing sequential lists of things.  I sure make plenty of them.  But that's not the ideal one should aim for in most places.  Typically about 7 lines or so of code, so you can see and reason about the whole function at once, is a better ideal.

[10:16:51] <InPhase> lf94: Many chains of assignments could as well, but you need to know all the dependencies.  Many functions calls near each other could as well, if you knew they didn't have ordering dependencies.
[10:16:52] <lf94> no data races
[10:16:55] <lf94> everethyng is a copy
[10:17:08] <lf94> InPhase: it's a change of mental model.
[10:17:11] <lf94> that's all
[10:17:27] <lf94> you should encourage such a change!
[10:17:30] *** Parts: tomathy (~jenova@user/quetzl) (Leaving)
[10:17:30] <InPhase> lf94: Yeah.  It requires some significantly different thinking about how you specify things.
[10:18:52] <InPhase> lf94: I've tried to think with the initial reasoning of, what if everything were parallel unless you specified otherwise?  Then down the chain of what do you need to specify to keep ordering where it's needed?
[10:19:32] <lf94> That would work on the assupmtion that most computations can be thought of as parallel
[10:19:34] <lf94> luckily it can
[10:19:42] <lf94> lambda calculus beta reduction is highly parallel.
[10:20:06] <lf94> inner most reductions can happen in isolation
[10:20:23] <lf94> InPhase: I think you're onto something.
[10:21:01] <lf94> fn length(a, b) -> sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
[10:21:06] <lf94> easily parallelizable
[10:21:15] <lf94> a^2 and b^2 can happen simultaneously
[10:21:32] <lf94> now imagine length(a,b) called in multiple places
[10:21:43] <lf94> all those calls can happen simultaneously
[10:22:00] <leduyquang753> How about `sqrt(a*a + b*b)`?
[10:22:07] <lf94> yes
[10:22:13] <lf94> that's actually what i was thinking
[10:22:21] <lf94> just used ^2 instead
[10:22:28] <InPhase> lf94: My mind first went in this direction when I did FPGA work starting back in 2006, because on an FPGA everything happens at once and you need to work really hard to sequentialize things.
[10:22:42] <leduyquang753> You can't do every step of this expression simultaneously, it's simply impossible.
[10:22:44] <lf94> FPGA is the future
[10:22:57] <lf94> of course not, just the a*a and b*b
[10:23:13] <InPhase> lf94: Although I think we can also make the sequencing pretty simple with some good language design.  But then it means code could run appropriately on an FPGA, or a GPU, or a CPU, simply compiled with different optimizations and arrangements.
[10:23:15] <lf94> sqrt is a single operation
[10:23:24] <lf94> unary
[10:23:27] <leduyquang753> See, there are just at least as many situations that can't be parallelized as those that can be.
[10:23:55] <lf94> you're basically making the argument there  are more unary functions than binary functions in the universe.
[10:24:02] <lf94> prove it and ill stfu
[10:24:05] <leduyquang753> So it has to continuously switch from sequential to parallel and back.
[10:24:12] <lf94> i would actually like to see a proof
[10:24:23] <InPhase> leduyquang753: Yes, but if you can efficiently fork and join at every location that can be parallelized, you can make perfectly balanced parallel code.
[10:24:27] <mishugan1> I thought most operations in the world were non-parallelizable?

[10:25:55] <lf94> 100%
[10:26:17] <lf94> you can parallelize the operations in the recursive function

[10:27:45] <lf94> i dont know shit about parallel programming
[10:27:45] <InPhase> MsEmilyFox: If it's a chained operation, then it's a sequential recursion, but not every recursion is necessarily sequential.

[10:28:49] <leduyquang753> New stuff is good, but before getting to excited about it we need to understand that nothing is a silver bullet.

[10:29:30] <InPhase> MsEmilyFox: void foo(vec, i=0) { if (i < len(vec) { v[i] *= 2; foo(vec, i+1); } }  Surely you agree this is parallelizable.

[10:31:43] <InPhase> MsEmilyFox: Recursion is therefore sometimes parallelizable.  The key is the dependency chain.
[10:32:00] <lf94> which probably goes for _any_ parallelizable problem.
[10:32:05] <MsEmilyFox> interesting
[10:32:07] <mishugan1> yup
[10:32:23] <MsEmilyFox> is this related to tail recursion at all
[10:32:25] <lf94> a needs b needs c <- impossible to parallelize.
[10:32:32] <lf94> no
[10:32:45] <mishugan1> That's not an easy problem though - dividing the problem to be amenable to parallel processing. In some obvious cases, yes
[10:32:52] <lf94> tail recursion is simply an optimization that happens at the assembler / os level
[10:33:00] <lf94> rather than continue to pack the call stack
[10:33:00] <mishugan1> tail rec is basically a jump

[10:33:45] <oldlaptop> InPhase's example is tail-recursive, and obviously so.
[10:33:48] <lf94> it's optimizing an implementation of recursion. 
[10:33:52] <vdamewood> Fleck: Pretend I typed that correctly.
[10:33:56] <lf94> recursion itself is optimal.
[10:34:17] <InPhase> mishugan1: That's what I think requires language redesign.  Make the programmer specify what can't be parallel, give tools for clean writing of dependencies for the stuff that can, and then it might start flowing out more naturally that we see micro-parallelizations all over the place.  Then it's just a matter of new optimizer reasoning.
[10:34:48] <mishugan1> InPhase: I seem to recall some language that was trying to do precisely that... I forget the name...

[11:53:20] <Intelo> apotheon zvijezda Twix AWs:  t3 medium with 4g ram, 2 vCPU is about $27 per month on demand     vultr: $20   linode: $20  digialocean: $20
[11:54:28] <MsEmilyFox> how much if i add gpu
[11:54:44] <MsEmilyFox> $200 / month?
[11:54:57] <Intelo> don't see such option there though
[11:55:07] <Intelo> but my main question was :
[11:55:21] <Intelo> Which vps providers bill according to usage only? ie if server was shutdown for 15 days a month, the I get 50% bill. If I can squeeze the ram and cpu cap to lower amount, I again get lower bill?
[11:55:37] <Intelo> aws is not the option due to its hight cost I guess

[13:12:06] <beaky> yes the problem is that the designers of regex used backslash as the escape character when there should instead be some kind of grouping for escapes so that it is easier to nest nested escapes
[13:12:48] <GeDaMo> Actually, do you need to escape the () in the character class?
[13:13:00] <PlanckWalk> What, like if you have a number following a \, it means how many levels of escaping?

[14:12:43] <duuude> ok so neural networks are like each neuron is like one axis in a grid, and you corrrelate it to input from other neurons like putting dots on the grid
[14:13:22] <duuude> and then you draw a line connecting the dots, and use it for predicting what the other input would be, only using one of them

[16:17:13] <Stefan26> and I never liked repetition... at school I'd only do minimal amount of exercises from each chapter... and never repeat things (like once i solved a sudoku or rubik's cube i never touched it again... so i never become fluent)
[16:17:35] <pyzozord> any time you created a nested dict in python, or frankly even JSON is a tree or array of trees

[16:58:51] <mrig> But you dont add anything when you refactor, but you do sometimes cancel code out.
[16:59:50] <mrig> well if you add bugs it is perhaps due to the same issue :)
[17:00:42] <pyzozord> Using my leyman reasoning I'd say that "factoring out" is the act of selecting a piece of code (or multiple) and moving it to a separate function so you don't need to think about it anymore

[17:10:21] <nomagno> Well yeah
[17:10:50] <pyzozord> the alternative is that factoring out means really removing code, just deleting lines and changing other lines so the code functions the same without the deleted part

"Lambda calculus" is really just a name for a system that uses higher-order functions (and basically nothing else) to define a system that can do any computation,  basically the same idea as Turing machines.
[19:03:16] <[itchyjunk]> nomagno, well that idea is fairly recent in humans

[19:04:15] <pyzozord> yes (untyped) lambda calculus is really just higher order functions
[19:04:29] <pyzozord> which are really kind of meta functions speaking colloquially
[19:04:54] <nomagno> Yeah trying to learn untyped is very counter-intuitive to me
[19:05:20] <[itchyjunk]> the "meta" part is maybe when you define a function recursively
[19:05:27] <nomagno> Because, to be able to conceptualize some stuff, I kinda need to replace the placeholder functions with actual data and operations
[19:05:40] <[itchyjunk]> but not all of untyped lambda calculus is self referential function definitions
[19:05:40] <nomagno> Which makes it a different type of lambda calculus!
[19:06:02] <[itchyjunk]> so calling enterity of untyped lambda calulus meta is a bit of a stretch
[19:06:17] <pyzozord> i can see we are talking about different level ob abstractions
[19:06:24] <nomagno> Is untyped lambda calculus useful to describe the behaviour of a 'real-world' program without generalizing?
[19:06:28] <[itchyjunk]> nomagno, "data" maybe the wrong idea though

[19:11:06] <bjs> pyzozord: well a recursive function might be considered "meta",  but it's not higher-order.
[19:11:31] <bjs> it's a function that refers to itself (which is informally very "meta"),  but the function doesn't take or return functions itself.

The first is exhibiting more team leadership behaviors, whether explicitly assigned or implicitly by action, involving things like active and regular mentorship of more junior developers, dispute resolution by careful consideration of 
[19:58:18] <InPhase> viewpoints and offering of expertise, and a regular recognition of longer term priorities and nudging toward a refocus of efforts onto things which will achieve them within timelines.  The second is a more senior engineering role which would typically be characterized by more active guidance and decision making on big-picture architectural issues, aiming to make decisions and provide code 
[19:58:24] <InPhase> contributions that focus on redirecting the overall structure of development toward a state that is better engineered, more reliable, more robust, and more maintainable.

[20:00:14] <InPhase> pyzozord: And of course you know as well as I do, that sometimes it's just "This person is older and has worked for a while now."  ;)  But those are the sorts of things that make someone desireable and effective in one of the more senior titled roles.
[20:00:16] <pyzozord> InPhase: I think I meet some of these, but I might be lacking in others
[20:01:05] <InPhase> pyzozord: It's a set of things to work at, and they take attentive practice like any other skills.
[20:01:57] <pyzozord> I'm worried about my ability to resolve conflicts. I mean I think I'm quite good at resolving conflicts between other people, but not when I am in the argument myself. Also I'm worried about my architectural skills

[20:03:30] <InPhase> pyzozord: Here's one of the deep secrets to being a respected senior software engineer...  Listen carefully.  The more junior programmers are in the thick of things.  Even if they have wrong ideas, they probably have a wrong idea for a good reason, and sometimes those good reasons are compelling enough that their usually-wrong idea is right for a purpose.  So be very attentive to what people in the 
[20:03:36] <InPhase> trenches of a piece of code are saying, and consider input carefully before issuing advice or decrees.
[20:04:19] <pyzozord> And there is also the general leadership behaviors which I don't think I really have. I like to mentor people via helping them by helping them arrive at solutions themselves as much as they can give as little as necessary to keep them engaged and progressing. But I think often people are really not interested in my mentorship. I once had a junior developer who literally was manipulating me to do

[20:04:25] <pyzozord> things for them if they didn't want to do it
[20:04:50] <InPhase> Even if you need to correct or override the plans of a more junior programmer, it's essential to get their buy-in, so you should first understand what they're thinking and why, so that you can figure out what they're not understanding, and then teach them that thing.  Teaching is a big part of that mentoring, and it rests heavily on that listening.
[20:04:50] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: basically that is saying that simply-typed lambda calculus has programs that look like `\x: unit. x`  or `(\x: int. x+1) 4`  etc, and then it explains how to execute the program (called "reduction") and then it describes how you type-check programs written in STLC

[20:06:21] <pyzozord> InPhase: I'll be in a team responsible for developing internal frameworks and libraries so that other teams can build features easier. I'll be a senior forntend developer in that team.
[20:06:58] <InPhase> pyzozord: Well with a more senior title you're harder to manipulate.  But you actually need to be mindful of the reverse...  The more senior your title, the easier it is to manipulate others, so you want to walk with a delicate touch, respecting your own authority so that no one thinks you are misusing it or creating an environment that they don't want to work in.

[20:09:42] <pyzozord> InPhase: thanks for the advice, those are all great tips. Here is what I get from it so far: 1) listen carefully to juniors even if their solution is not great, they have a real reason that has to be solved 2) be as subtle as possible, your words might carry more weight
[20:09:52] <InPhase> pyzozord: This can be very little things.  Someone asked me a question over the past week, while we're all out on holiday at work, and the person who knows the answer works under me.  So I explained I wouldn't be asking the person under me until we're back from break.  It's one thing if a person not senior to me asks me a work-detail question over break.  It's another thing if I ask someone who 
[20:09:58] <InPhase> works under me the same question, so I am holding off because it's not time critical.  You have to be attentive to the power imbalances, and respect what it means to people on the other end.

[20:17:37] <InPhase> Well you don't need to fix what's not broken.  :)  But often that starts from listening.  Figure out what the more junior programmers think is hard to work with, and figure out what the stakeholders think is unreliable or not working well.

So it's a wise sensation to feel you need more studying, but don't fall into an imposter syndrome on it.  It's just there is more to keep going on.  :)

[21:16:44] <mrig> InPhase: I was ruminating further your question as to whether or not a multi threaded computer system that has individual parts that are essentially being overseen by a central module, if it is programmed to understand investigate and to understand its own state, whether or not this might constitute consciousness; To which my response was that it would not. It bugged me a little not to be
[21:16:46] <mrig> able to give you the underlying reason for my answer but I've now managed to pinpoint more precisely why it is that I think this and more to the point what the differentiating factor is: Randomness, such a system would, I think, remain an imitation of consciousness so long as it is being probabilistically driven by different source from that of a sentient life form.
[21:17:55] <InPhase> mrig: And what "different source" do you think a "sentient" life form has?  And what are the properties of that source?
[21:18:30] <mrig> Well quantum vibrations, or phase or spin, would be my best guess.
[21:18:32] <_73> I am 2/3rds through David Gries's `The Science Of Programming` and I am wondering if any of you have read it and if you actually think about weakest preconditions in your day to day programming.

[21:20:36] <mrig> Sure yes, and random generators exist, but the nature of this is quintessential is my though.
[21:20:42] <mrig> thought
[21:20:48] <InPhase> mrig: You just tight loop an increment and compare to a fast clock, and extract the low bits, and the thermal fluctuations that cause the clock mismatches between these two processes are quantum in origin.

[21:21:50] <InPhase> mrig: Same spatial coordinate axes, same time coordinate axis.  What's different?
[21:22:05] <mrig> we occupy a lump of space and time, as mentioned I'm into the notion of consciousness being field that is entwined with space and item.
[21:22:43] <InPhase> My computer is so spatially and temporally close to me that my hands spend a lot of time in direct contact with it.  :)

[21:25:18] <InPhase> mrig: This is probably your intuition hunting for the mysterious aspects in the unknowable parts.  But maybe it's not in an unknowable part, but just in a not fully understood but knowable part.
[21:28:08] <InPhase> mrig: My suggestion about consciousness and the management thread was not really suggesting that I think said thread is "conscious" by the way I like to use the term, but was intended to create the discomfort you feel about the difficulty of declaring what it actually means.  But I DO think that we write code which is much more intelligent and aware than many living creatures.  So we need to factor 
[21:28:14] <InPhase> this into our understanding of what various levels of organic cognition actually mean.
[21:28:16] <mrig> Oh I think that is is knowable, I am already studying it.

[21:29:31] <InPhase> How about google and a chicken?

[21:34:50] <InPhase> Maybe by the start of April they will release an artificial Google Chicken.
[21:35:05] <pyzozord> that game Talos Principle made me look at conciousness in wider way. My optinion before was that conciousness is a sort of illusion and emergent property of a computational system. But I thought it only it in terms of biological (brains) and electronical computers. That game made me realize that it can be ANY system
[21:35:35] <pyzozord> so by that line of though any system of elements can be computational and potentiall have conciousness
[21:35:52] <GeDaMo> I wonder if neurons experience crosstalk
[21:35:53] <mrig> pyzozord: or was that the belief of the games author?
[21:36:08] <InPhase> GeDaMo: They do.
[21:36:26] <mrig> GeDaMo: diaphony, yes could well be the case.
[21:36:42] <pyzozord> mrig: the game asked me what I thought was conciousness and gave me few answers. I thought it was a system and there was an option for a system, but it was "any system"
[21:36:52] <mrig> Seems that they might depend upon it too.
[21:36:58] <pyzozord> and that made me think about it and how my idea wasn't taken to it's full potential

[22:56:47] <pyzozord> dns leak protection seems like a thing that is implemented in vpns
[22:56:53] <inky_> without vpn i can use termux, share internet, and use gemini client, which connects to port 1967 i guess
[22:57:12] <inky_> jabber that connects to 5552 i guess doesnt work too.
[22:57:46] <pyzozord> so without vpn everything hits the default dns by design
[22:57:54] <inky_> yes
[22:57:56] <pyzozord> unless you have some weird dns set up
[22:57:59] <pyzozord> maybe that's the case
[22:58:35] <pyzozord> quite possible considering you use niche keyboard layout, nieche browsers and nieche os
[22:58:44] <pyzozord> I'd assume you use some nieche default dns
[22:58:49] <pyzozord> niche*
[22:59:03] <deniska> android is barely niche :)
[22:59:07] <inky_> i don't have any setup, actually. in these modern androids you can only override dns with some 'private dns' config which i did not use
[22:59:30] <pyzozord> they mentioned something about sailfish
[22:59:31] <inky_> i tried now to solve this, but was unable, because it wants hostname, not ip
[22:59:37] <inky_> maybe because of that.
[23:00:01] <pyzozord> this problems happens on gsm or wifi?
[23:00:07] <inky_> lineageos i believe uses google's dns servers by default
[23:00:15] <inky_> everything work with wifi too
[23:00:21] <nomagno> Android is not a niche OS, period
[23:00:26] <inky_> the problem is only with data connection
[23:00:30] <inky_> mobile data
[23:00:41] <pyzozord> android is very mainstream i was talking aobut that lineage and sailfish things
[23:00:49] <pyzozord> ah interesting
[23:00:52] <nomagno> they're just Android distros
[23:00:59] <pyzozord> so that sounds like maybe an issue with your gsm network
[23:01:29] <pyzozord> unless you can use the gsm network and change default dns
[23:01:33] <pyzozord> check if you can do that

[23:14:11] <nomagno> (Weren't the notion of a table, a document, and an object as separate things was pretty much brought into existence by Microsoft, as in extrinsic classification of data as a necessity?)
[23:14:18] <GeDaMo> Prolog takes a bit of getting used to :P
[23:14:33] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: you define answer(42) and ask it to give you the question, it calculates for a billion years and then tells you
[23:15:11] <pyzozord> is it more useful than traditional paradigms in some cases?
