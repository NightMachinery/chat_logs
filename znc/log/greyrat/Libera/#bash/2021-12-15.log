[03:17:25] <mknod> "$PWD/$rel_path" is always reliable.
[03:17:49] <earendel> im talking about reasons using relative paths shouldn't be used in scripts.
[03:18:47] <earendel> and also if that is the essence of faq 028 (to always use absolute paths)

[03:21:49] <earendel> reliable in the sense of matching the developerrs intention. like to use the current directory whatever it is.
[03:22:40] <earendel> however changing the current directory via script was also discouraged, iirc.
[03:23:06] <earendel> possibly because scripts are allowed to change it xd
[03:23:06] <mknod> Why would it be?
[03:23:14] <yitz> !parent
[03:23:14] <greybot> When you run a script, it can not affect the parent shell. If you want to affect the parent shell, you need to source the script from the parent shell. See ''help source''
[03:23:16] <earendel> im not sure.

[12:34:29] <ormaaj> mh i looked for 2 seconds and saw that detail. Figured it was just toy code.
[12:35:04] <bud> this works https://0x0.st/-F5L.txt
[12:35:16] <bud> but not sure why that is better than my first attempt.
[12:35:49] <bud> in short _o is a assarray with commandline options.
[12:36:00] <bud> so if --list-directory DIR is a dir
[12:36:28] <bud> _menu_command will be a call to rofi with the menu populated by the content of DIR
[12:36:50] <bud> the script prefixes the selected item with DIR
[12:37:03] <bud> but i can only do that if the selection is not empty.

[12:37:22] <bud> and i only do this crap if --list-directory is set
[12:37:40] <ormaaj> It looked like you were teeing just to make an entire copy of the stream for[[ $(cat) ]] which will return true if there'even one byte of stuff to read. You can easily eliminate tee entirely.

[12:39:14] <bud> ormaaj: i want the test to be true if there is only one byte.
[12:39:15] <stevenm_> basically so that nothing is allowed to put (whatever is being ran) unless it sends to >&3

[13:46:29] <pj> stevenm_: -E is the default for GNU echo, but we recommend that you use printf instead of echo.
[13:47:05] <pj> oh, -E is the default of the bash builtin echo
[13:47:06] <ormaaj> Well I don't typically do interactive bash scripts but if you do it at least exposes basic access to an actual line-editor. Better than rlwrap
[13:47:36] <ormaaj> oh echo not read

[13:48:05] <pj> !echo
[13:48:06] <ormaaj> No it's useless.
[13:48:06] <greybot> echo outputs a string. echo has many portability problems, and should never be used with option flags. Consider printf instead: printf 'name: %s\n' "$name". http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/commands/builtin/echo | http://cfajohnson.com/shell/cus-faq.html#Q0b | http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/echo+printf

[21:38:47] <aetnaeus> right now I am using uudecode and base64 as a fallback
[21:39:02] <aetnaeus> which is technically non standard, but most systems that don't seem to have uudecode have the coreutils base64
[21:39:11] <twkm> "most"
[21:39:16] <aetnaeus> yes
[21:39:21] <twkm> uh-huh.

[21:39:47] <olspookishmagus> that problem yeah it begins to be obvious
[21:40:16] <twkm> anyway, for other non-standard things you might use the openssl or gnutls-cli commands.
[21:40:35] <aetnaeus> openssl seems to be even less common than base64
[21:40:58] <aetnaeus> alternatively, is there some non base64 human readable format I can use that is more portable?
[21:41:03] <olspookishmagus> /usr/share/gnulib/lib/base64.c
