[00:33:52] <apotheon> Logic is a system that addresses specific needs.  It is not a thing into which a thing fits; it is its own thing.
[00:33:53] <pulse> InPhase, Think about it intuitively. What happens when you decide to open or close your fist?
[00:33:53] <InPhase> pulse: Will is closely related to motivation.

[00:34:21] <mrig> pulse: Though I do agree with you, i still think that we can get a much greater definition.

[00:34:43] <pulse> mrig, It's a deep metaphysical problem. I doubt a formal solution to it can exist
[00:34:45] <mrig> not an answer but a model.

[00:34:52] <apotheon> pulse: . . . or you might miss the relevance.
[00:35:00] <pulse> And the hard problem of consciousness for that matter
[00:35:03] <mrig> [itchyjunk]: Are you responding to me?
[00:35:13] <Decker> [itchyjunk] if you limit yourself to a subset of JS behaviors I'm sure it's there.  functional programming, like OOP is more of a mindset or model than a language; you can cheat a lot in a JS implementation/experimentation though
[00:35:18] <apotheon> pulse: Why do you seem so incoherent when talking about things that seem relevant to qualia, then?
[00:35:21] <InPhase> pulse: There are different processes depending on what motivates me to open or close my wrist.  Sometimes it is a conscious process like I do it for the purpose of the debate.  Sometimes I'm procedurally reacting to a goal like taking a drink of water.  Sometimes I am unclasping the hot pot handle I just grabbed.  So there are multiple situational answers, but each can be addressed and studied.
[00:35:30] <[itchyjunk]> Decker, well i don't understand the search results from google then

But don't mistake unfinished science from unstudiable science, as it is being studied.  Some of the prominent theories regard consciousness as a reduction process intended to synchronize the parallel processing of the brain for coordinated activity, most 
[00:40:53] <[itchyjunk]> supposidly, it's also called doubled y combinator or omega combinator
[00:40:53] <apotheon> Qualia fit into logical arguments as apodictism.
[00:40:55] <InPhase> likely being closely intertwined with certain low frequency signals in the brain that provide this coordination over some connected brain networks.  The result of this involves the ability to hold a certain set of thoughts and states in active recall for processing, which manifests in what we call "consciousness".

Knowing that a model *isnt* refutable is not always easy or obvious, maybe we just haven't thought of the experiment (although sometimes the model itself makes it clear we cannot test it).
[01:00:54] <nomagno> pulse: Well, you know, if figuring out WHY mathematics and the fundamental laws of the universe exist is hard, it's because there's absolutely no cold, factual evidence on anything related to it.

[01:49:46] <pulse> InPhase, I don't think you fully understand my points though. It's not that you can't describe adequately to a doctor or someone who can relate. It's that if you _never_ had a headache, no amount of knowledge can make you understand what a headache really feels like

[01:50:42] <apotheon> important phrase: "as we understand it"
[01:50:44] <pulse> InPhase, I've tried
[01:50:46] <apotheon> Let's use that a bit more.
[01:50:55] <nomagno> pulse: That's because conciousness is a fragile thing, you can describe a given qualium as its entire context
[01:50:59] <InPhase> pulse: Then the correct conclusion is that you tried and were unsuccessful.  :)
[01:51:06] <nomagno> apotheon: Do you get me?
[01:51:09] <[itchyjunk]> any 2 person who understands and can measure frequency can talk about the same "red"

[01:51:15] <[itchyjunk]> eyes or no eyes.
[01:51:19] <apotheon> I see a lot of violations of the idea that we should recognize the difference between something not being true and something not being true-as-we-understand-it.
[01:51:22] <Stefan26> you can just enjoy the predictions of quantum mechanics
[01:51:23] <pulse> You can frame it poetically, sure
[01:51:35] <pulse> But the "real" redness will elude the recipient
[01:51:45] <[itchyjunk]> Stefan26, yes the predictions are impressive
[01:51:46] <InPhase> pulse: What you must first decide is what is a sufficient explanation of redness to count as a success.
[01:51:47] <pulse> Similarly you can't explain what music is like to a deaf person since birth
[01:51:54] <apotheon> nomagno: the singular is "quale" by he way

[01:52:03] <apotheon> . . . about what?
[01:52:06] <pulse> InPhase, Look at an image of red apple. That experience is sufficient
[01:52:32] <pulse> It's not transferrable
[01:52:39] <pulse> Unless the recipient already knows what red is like
[01:53:04] <InPhase> pulse: That doesn't tell me what is a sufficient understanding to count as a success criteria in your model.  You need to choose that.

[01:53:21] <InPhase> pulse: What is the thing you wish for the person to know or comprehend about red?
[01:53:35] <pulse> InPhase, If you want a better example, take someone who never rode a bicycle. Now answer this: given 10 years, and any amount of theoretical study, can you make that person understand how to ride a bicycle such that, on his first try he will sit on the bicycle and ride it without falling over?
[01:54:22] <flakland> you might be able to describe red to a lind person by using  band pass audio filters
[01:54:33] <pulse> What I'm trying to point to here is the difference between experiential knowledge and theoretical/transferrable knowledge

[01:54:37] <apotheon> I accidentally a letter.
[01:54:41] <InPhase> pulse: Quite possibly.  I was pretty decent at ice skating and skiing the first time I tried them, from just theoretical consideration and analogy to other activities I've done.
[01:55:02] <pulse> Well, my claim is that even after 10 years of studying how to ride a bicycle, the person will sit on the bike, and fall right over :D
[01:55:03] <nomagno> apotheon: Well, I've put a bit of thought into how to phrase the reason a quale is not possible to explain to another 'out of the box' (non-cyborg :P) human. The best I can come up with in terms [ pulse !] can understand is that a quale is its entire context, the human and the environment. The singular event can be formalized, (if we go away from regular philosophy and into pulse's to logic or not to logic thingy) as the event itself
[01:55:04] <mrig> flakland: I was just pondering similar.
[01:55:07] <bjs> pulse: the problem is if your definition of magic hinges on what is impossible to understand and/or describe (which? does it matter?)  How can you tell which are the things which are impossible to do so, and which we would be able to do
[01:55:25] <nomagno> It's a valid interpretation, at least, I think.
[01:55:33] <InPhase> pulse: I think that's avoidable with a bicycle.  It's a pretty well defined problem.

[01:56:56] <pulse> Yes, yes, time started with the universe, blah blah :D
[01:56:56] <apotheon> Weirdly, it seems like pulse is using the idea of qualia to describe something that isn't technically qualia, by implying that there is one experience of red that is shared by all red-experiencers.

[01:57:34] <Stefan26> someone who has fell from a 2 meter cliff can imagine what it's like to fall from a 4 meter cliff? anyone alive can imagine sitting on some rusty saddle with pedals

[01:58:44] <pulse> The argument is pretty simple though apotheon. Unless you can tell a blind man what red is like? :P
[01:58:52] <mrig> But that would only be a robot that resembled one type of human, Humans as a species are far more complex.

[01:59:19] <bjs> pulse: your argument sort of runs in a circle, something is magical if it's mysterious, it's mysterious if you can't describe it, you can't describe it if you don't understand it, and you can't understand things because some things are mysterious

[02:36:29] <nomagno> In 1966, Berger solved the domino problem in the negative. He proved that no algorithm for the problem can exist, by showing how to translate any Turing machine into a set of Wang tiles that tiles the plane if and only if the Turing machine does not halt. The undecidability of the halting problem (the problem of testing whether a Turing machine eventually halts) then implies the undecidability of Wang's tiling problem.

The idea of constraining adjacent tiles to match each

[03:04:47] <tomathy> thanks pulse 
[03:04:49] <nomagno> It's a proper mathematical language
[03:04:58] <pulse> nomagno, Is it 1:1 mappable to real computers? Cause that sounds unlikely
[03:05:01] <apotheon> pulse: It has much the same utility as the Turing machine.
[03:05:08] <apotheon> universal Turing machine, that is
[03:05:12] <pulse> I see
[03:05:19] <nomagno> apotheon: It is not very dense, but you better reread it multiple times if you want to understand ;D
[03:05:19] <pulse> That makes sense
[03:05:27] <oldlaptop> A UTM is more or less by definition *more* powerful than real computers, because real computers have finite memories.
[03:05:48] <pulse> Yeah but it's a theoretical framework
[03:05:52] <pulse> You can't actually use it for computation
[03:05:53] <apotheon> nomagno: The fact I'm already familiar with the subject matter should help if/when I read it.
[03:05:58] <pulse> Without an implementation that is
[03:05:59] <oldlaptop> (Real computers are equivalent to "linear bounded automatons", which are Turing machines with finite tapes.)
[03:06:21] <nomagno> apotheon: Then you will probably find it fairly light, I'm definitely not familiar with it

[03:06:48] <tomathy> hi
[03:06:50] <PlanckWalk> Well, they can use external storage that can be attached during runtime
[03:06:57] <pulse> I heard it described as a worse Python, idk if that's accurate though
[03:06:59] <tomathy> i overwound a mechanical clock, and heard a thud, is it likely broken?
[03:07:08] <oldlaptop> Physical implementations of LBAs have of course been done as examples/jokes/whatever, and someone could implement the lambda calculus in software (lisp has something of this nature)
[03:07:14] <tomathy> now every time i wind it it seems to spool over
[03:07:32] <apotheon> pulse: That'll do.  Grab a book called Understanding Computation.  It uses Ruby as the example language, but you don't really have to be a Rubyist to make good use of it.  Just pretend it's using executable pseudocode.
[03:07:37] <PlanckWalk> But there is of course a bound to how much storage can be attached, so it's still valid.
[03:07:44] <apotheon> pulse: That's the most friendly intro to lambda calculus that I've seen.

[03:20:31] <jamea> hi friends
[03:20:46] <vdamewood> So, third-parties can still code in GTK#, but the GNOME desktop itself doesn't useit.

[04:22:06] <apotheon> Various dietary habits can contribute to the problem, and some of them aren't part of the mainstream narrative about healthy eating habits.

[06:55:33] <InPhase> Incidentally you can also use nmap locally to see what is open, but netcat / ncat lets you actually test that basic communications are actually working if you have some sort of text-based protocol in use.
[06:56:45] <InPhase> netcat can also work as a very basic echo server, so you can test the connecting side as well.

[09:22:07] <pikapika> Yes but it is a language that is flexible enough to make that process quite natural while also not imposing undue performance reductions
[09:22:41] <pikapika> For example if we just compose structs, inherited objects member access will still just be a simple offset etc
[09:23:24] <EdFletcher> ok but none of this makes it an oop language, you must recognize that yeah?

[09:38:40] <mishugana> so why not accept that type systems vary in power by language, and use C as a high-level assembly instead of twisting it to do something it's not quite good at doing? Some cases like the Linux kernel are understandable - they had to make do with what they had, but generally?

[09:48:20] <InPhase> mishugana: Which it needed to do.  C++ already replaced C.
[09:48:32] <mishugana> jumpArtifact: Yes, good point.
[09:48:34] <InPhase> mishugana: Except for the people who didn't realize it yet.  :)
[09:48:50] <mishugana> I suppose that does make sense.
[09:49:02] *** Joins: pavonia (~user@user/siracusa)
[09:50:02] <mishugana> By the way, I've worked through most of Jon Gjengset's book, "Rust for Rustaceans", and I must say that it's an excellent book.. .highly recommended. Hardly an examples that you can run, but the insights and advice is very nice.
[09:50:27] <mishugana> I thought I was an advanced-intermediate/expert in Rust, but I learnt quite a few things from that book!
[09:50:29] <InPhase> jumpArtifact: The opposite might be beneficial though.  It's looking like Rust does a good job of preparing new C++ programmers for approaching C++ from its more modern perspective.
[09:51:29] <mishugana> Funnily, I see the two almost converging. C++ is moving from flexibility/unsafety -> safety, and Rust is moving in the opposite direction, from Safety -> flexibility with more potential for unsafety
[09:51:35] <InPhase> I don't know that I'd yet go as far as saying everyone should learn Rust before C++, simply because it's not completely certain Rust will have a lasting strong place in the field yet.  But it's getting there, and this might be the advisable path soon.

[09:52:09] <jumpArtifact> InPhase: I hadn't thought of that, but that sounds about right
[09:52:30] <pikapika> InPhase, C is still a very popular and well liked language
[09:52:49] <mishugana> InPhase: My personal feeling is that it will spur further development in the approach (unique in the mainstream) that Rust has with its ownership system. I checked Cyclone a while back, and I always wondered why they didn't take the "memory regions" concept to its full extent, which Project Verona from MS is doing now. Maybe I don't know enough about the domain, and need to learn more.
[09:53:15] <mishugana> So I feel like the ergonomics of Rust-like languages will only improve in the future. It may or may not include Rust as well.
[09:53:21] <InPhase> pikapika: But it shouldn't be, other than for maintaining things that are too burdensome to convert.
[09:53:39] <pikapika> Many people still choose C for new projects etc
[09:53:52] <mishugana> pikapika: That is true.
[09:54:37] <mishugana> Sometimes we have to remember that most of the industry as a whole hasn't even probably heard of Rust. People like us who hang around similar social media groups might be living in a sort of bubble for all we know.
[09:54:44] <InPhase> pikapika: But not because there aren't better things.  They're just stuck on an appeal to more complex programming with a less complex language.
[09:55:10] <mishugana> Sometimes I talk to people from other "enterprise corporations", and most of them don't know what Rust is, and those who have heard of it know next to nothing about it.
[09:55:14] <jumpArtifact> There's also the fact that if you want to use ffi (foreign-function-interface; like using C++ from Rust, or vice versa), exposing a C api makes it "easier"
[09:55:17] <mishugana> Something to temper tha hype with.

[09:55:58] <mishugana> InPhase: To be fair, some companies (many? most?) have very strict auditing rules about software that's used
[09:56:12] <pikapika> InPhase, yes I don't hate C++. I think its a nice advancement over C and has some things I don't see in any other lang.
[09:56:17] <mishugana> Hence why a lot of banks, for instance, are still stuck on Java 8 whil Java 17 is doing just fine.
[09:56:24] <pikapika> Like how much magic it is possible to do at compile time with zero runtime costs
[09:56:41] <InPhase> pikapika: C++ is the language that most needed an update like Rust.  And then C++ too is likely to linger for decades and still be used for projects after-and-if Rust becomes the smart choice for new projects.
[09:56:43] <pikapika> how fine grained we can make the concept of copying/moving etc
[09:56:46] <mishugana> pikapika: Yes, Rust is relatively weak in the comptime stuff.

[09:59:34] <pikapika> InPhase, yes new experiments are always welcome
[09:59:45] <mishugana> pikapika: what is your opinion on Pascal? To be more precise, modern pascal (FreePascal, say, with generics, OOP, the works)? Any thoughts? Compared to C? Curious.
[10:00:02] <pikapika> Just that one should be careful to not be overeager to impose less tested new things

Someone else has to make sure all the Pro's documents are valid. I want to introduce a boolean variable stating that all the Pro's documents have been verified/checked/asserted by that other personn.

[17:04:29] <FloridaMan> So, in scrum training, it was recommended to us that we consider the full point value of items that are left in review at the end of the sprint, i.e. they do but count toward the velocity and they do count toward the next sprint's point commitment, but I find this hard to swallow in practice and I'm wondering what everyone else's experience with
[17:04:29] <FloridaMan> this might be. Right now I'm doing work that can only be reviewed by a single person that's on vacation, so it will look on paper like my commitment hasn't been met, although in reality I'm done coding everything and it's in review waiting for someone on holiday. This also means I'll be underloaded next sprint and probably pulling things in from
[17:04:29] <FloridaMan> backlog.
[17:05:02] <FloridaMan> Admittedly, the reviewer is a single point of failure, but that's why I'm doing the work I'm doing (to be a relief for that single point).

[17:05:57] <stella> idk FloridaMan at my team we just laugh at the misshapen graphs cuz we always end up running out of work and pulling shit in from the next sprint

[17:06:23] <mishugana> yeah, agile is shit at best
[17:06:33] <mishugana> especially Agile. Heh
[17:06:34] <stella> fortunately we have enough people in the team to like cover everyones reviews
[17:06:53] <stella> must be awkward waiting long for stuff to get reviewed
[17:07:30] <mishugana> In the end, waterfall works best.. it is, after all, agile with month to year long sprints :D
[17:07:49] <FloridaMan> mishugana: our lead architect wants to be the gatekeeper for this particular project, and I'm doing this work so that I can end up being that second person: the one on my team that can act as the main backend resource since we are very frontend heavy at the moment
[17:08:40] <mishugana> then there really is no option but to count that item in the next sprint, and maybe take some other item for this sprint instead - if the charts need to make some sort of sense
[17:11:31] <mishugana> stella: that sort of shows how the whole estimation process, especially in "agile" "Agile" et al is fucked up to say the least. 
[17:11:45] <FloridaMan> Yeah that's what I thought. Basically going to end up with a shit burndown this sprint and likely a way overstated velocity next
[17:11:52] <mishugana> In general,of course, but you won't find the creators of those silly processes admitting that... ever.
[17:11:54] *** Joins: wovixo (~wovixo@128.104.205.49)
[17:12:00] <FloridaMan> I guess at least averages over sprints are taken for velocity
[17:12:15] <stella> mishugana: me and a coworker half-joke that our estimation process is essentially picking random fibonnaci numbers out of the air
[17:12:19] <stella> half-joke? not even really a joke
[17:12:22] <stella> that's what we do
[17:12:24] <stella> lol
[17:12:26] <mishugana> FloridaMan: Indeed. In some projects I worked on, the whole project analytics data was practically useless at best.
[17:12:47] <pyzozord> it's your gut feeling about the ticket scope, that's all it is
[17:12:59] <stella> yeah
[17:13:00] <mishugana> stella: Heh. Yeah, we used to have some rabid proponents buying some expensive cards for that purpose... ridiculous
[17:13:09] <stella> it's what pyzozord says
[17:13:18] <stella> and sometimes your gut will be way wrong LOL
[17:13:27] <pyzozord> but having highly granular multiple educated guesses is much better than having one educated guess about the whole project
[17:13:34] <stella> true
[17:13:37] <FloridaMan> I do find that the average of the estimates across the team members is usually fairly accurate as long as each person understands what's being asked
[17:14:08] <FloridaMan> Any one person's estimate can be a crapshoot
[17:14:36] <stella> what i find actually helps me is when tasks are well-defined and sitting there in JIRA so i dont have to remember what needs to be done lol
[17:14:49] <mishugana> I suppose it depends on team dynamics as much as the process. In a well-oiled team that's worked well together for some time, that could work.
[17:14:51] <FloridaMan> Of course things lurking in the corner can destroy any estimate of pretty much any kind
[17:15:07] <pyzozord> FloridaMan: that's why it's an estimate
[17:15:09] <stella> tricky part is breaking larger projects down into good tickets
[17:15:18] <FloridaMan> pyzozord: indeed
[17:15:20] <stella> we had a guy on our team doing that for a while but he fucked off and our actual PO is shite at this
[17:15:31] <stella> so we need to work more on our own ticket-creation process or something

[17:16:01] <pyzozord> mishugana: isn't that the case in every company? ;)
[17:16:02] <FloridaMan> I find that our team is pretty good at estimation most of the time. There's the "unknown danger level" that usually we will add complexity to account for
[17:16:24] <mishugana> pyzozord: true... only the degree varies
[17:16:26] <stella> mishugana: oof
[17:16:57] * stella mostly writes tickets when she finds bugs
[17:16:59] <pyzozord> mishugana: yeah, I think the oil that makes everything work is "in good faith" as much as possible
[17:17:03] * stella is pretty good at finding bugs
[17:17:09] <mishugana> In some other projects, we basically accepted a bunch of stories in terms of importance to the customer, and then worked backwards - no sprints, nothing. Actually worked well for that project.
[17:17:30] <FloridaMan> stella is therefore pretty good at writing tickets
[17:17:32] <FloridaMan> Lol

[18:17:36] <nomagno> The 'I like homeopathy' part better be a joke though
[18:18:11] <[itchyjunk]> Some medication underperforms compared to placebo or homeopathy

[18:18:43] <duuude> it once had all sorts of germs in it 
[18:19:02] <pulse> Yes, that's why they drank beer all the time
[18:19:02] <nomagno> Well, it works but I wouldn't call the founding principle of homeopathy the reason it works.

[18:23:37] <pulse> Find examples where it's been completely laughably wrong
[18:23:47] <[itchyjunk]> western medication documents faliures and changes it.
[18:23:53] <pulse> Sometimes
[18:23:57] <[itchyjunk]> this process is absent in homopathy completly.
[18:24:06] <pulse> After the damage has been done
[18:24:06] <duuude> pulse: actually before mid 20th-century those types of folk medicine worked better, you know why?
[18:24:10] <[itchyjunk]> so it's a non sequester
[18:24:16] <pulse> duuude, No idea
[18:24:36] <[itchyjunk]> duuude, because only the ones that lived told the stories
[18:24:43] <[itchyjunk]> so it suffered from surviver bias
[18:24:50] <wovixo> Channel Rule #2: Promote constructive discourse. I'm not convinced any of this "dicussion" is adhering to either the spirit or the letter of that rule.
[18:24:56] <duuude> pulse: a doctor visits all sorts of sick people and is the main germ carrier
[18:25:10] <nomagno> I thought this channel being based in computer science, a branch of mathematics, would imply a bit more acceptance of both inductive and deductive reasoning as the base for... Most stuff
[18:25:10] <[itchyjunk]> the rules are more of a guideline
[18:25:10] <pyzozord> ooh so that is what surviver bias is, interesting
[18:25:11] <pulse> duuude, I see
[18:25:31] <[itchyjunk]> nomagno, it's true in general.
[18:25:33] <duuude> pulse: your granma giving you nonsense herbs convincing you that you are healing worked objectively better.
[18:25:40] <pyzozord> heard the other day and didn't quite understand it
[18:25:48] <duuude> and that is why this kind of folk medicine is so prevalent

[19:23:16] <GeDaMo> user51: it doesn't seem opaque to me :P
[19:23:22] <edun> yes, but chemo is much more studied and the success rate is well known for different treatments
[19:23:37] <duuude> pulse: I was just saying the other treatments have already passed that stage, and jumped through those loops already. You were saying modern medical research doesn't work and now say your favorite treatment is backed by medicinal research so I thing the actual subject is now settled.

[19:24:07] <edun> so as for now, i'd say the current treatments are what most people would (and should) stick with
[19:24:12] <edun> duuude agreed
[19:24:13] <pulse> edun, Well, I'm glad it helped you. But I've known quite a few people that didn't make it through, and all chemo succeeded in was basically degrading the quality of their lives even further
[19:24:24] <pulse> It's not an easy thing to discuss honestly
[19:24:52] <edun> pulse, my life has also degraded because of it, but it was worth it to live through it. I'm sorry for your loss(es)
[19:25:31] <pulse> duuude, I'm convinced that RSO does work. Not always, not in all cases, but it works. If countries legalized cannabis 100 years ago, maybe it would be mainstream today. As it is, I've read a report from one of our local hospitals that something like 90% of cancer patients reach out for illegal methods of acquiring RSO
[19:25:33] <duuude> pulse: if you don't die of something else, and even pass through some cancer episodes, you would still eventually die of some other cancer. if we had solved cancer we would live forever.
[19:25:36] <pulse> Can you imagine this figure? 90%?

[21:22:29] <ProfSimm> pulse: this is repeated in the Prometheus legend about Prometheus giving us fire (knowledge) then again with the Serpent and the Apple (again knowledge) and so on and so on

[21:22:35] <pulse> You know all this could just be a metaphor for humans being possessed by thoughts

[21:22:44] <stagas> xD
[21:23:10] <pulse> Thoughts = aliens. Goa'uld = thoughts. No thoughts = freedom from fake gods
[21:23:27] <pulse> Coincidentally all mystical traditions through the ages constantly talk about no thought
[21:23:36] <pulse> And mediation is literally a practice of non thought
[21:23:38] <pulse> Coincidence?
[21:23:45] <ProfSimm> Now let me go for the weird part. The top three companies in the world that spread knowledge all repeat mythology symbolisms from those religions:  Amazon Kindle, Fire Tabelts = Prometheus. Apple = Christianity. Windows are also a symbol of seeing the world.
[21:24:02] <ProfSimm> The only thing I don't know is what the hell Google is except mispelling of Googol :D

[21:24:39] <pulse> I can see it

[22:05:10] <pyzozord> but they are clearly thinking on different levels. Jon thinks in abstract and less defined ways, and Curt is very detail oriented

[22:12:18] <macaw> pyzozord: Same. Artists touch that subconscious and generate their art from it. This is why the trend mostly holds that art (about a certain idea) comes first, then (X years later) philosophers/psychologists put it into words.
[22:12:33] <pyzozord> Towards the end of the interview there is a rapid fire questions section and the interviewer explicitly asks Jon "please answer the question succinctly, briefly". It on the fourth question Jon goes into 10-15 minutes tangent
[22:13:07] <macaw> pyzozord: I've seen it in a couple of his interviews, but yeah, it is kinda funny. :p
[22:13:13] <pyzozord> they discuss in that interview the problem of verbalizing ideas at length actually

[22:14:06] <pyzozord> but it makes perfect sense now
[22:14:45] <mrig> art, or that which is considered to be art, is different in cultures; Quite a cool subject. The notion of the suffering artist is very much a cultural stereotype.

[23:46:50] <[itchyjunk]> simply typed lambda calc is supposed to be the easiest one
[23:46:55] <[itchyjunk]> it's already making my head spin
[23:47:23] <bex> what's the best language to learn?
[23:47:35] <[itchyjunk]> For what task?
[23:47:51] <sonny> in rust references don't have a base shared value like null, so instead some other sentinel value has to be used. What is nice is using the technique of enums to have a value that is a node, and a sentinel value for the tail
[23:47:57] <[itchyjunk]> If you goal is to communicate with people in China, mandarin would be a good language
[23:48:04] <bex> no
[23:48:24] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, i don't understand. in rust, you can't point to null?
[23:48:43] <sonny> [itchyjunk] lambda calc was "simple" enough, and I just read the first pdf I googled "intro to lambda calc"
[23:48:46] <[itchyjunk]> is rust statically typed?
[23:48:48] <sonny> [itchyjunk] yes that's correct
[23:48:50] <sonny> yes
[23:49:02] <[itchyjunk]> there is untyped lambda calculus
[23:49:19] <[itchyjunk]> then there is typed lambda calculus. simple lambda calculus is the simplest typed lambda calculus
[23:49:30] <flakland> what can you do with it?
[23:49:38] <[itchyjunk]> hmm seems odd that rust doesn't have a null type

[23:49:54] <sonny> anything I suspect, it's a method of computation
[23:49:56] <[itchyjunk]> so i can't point to a non existant object before i make it?
[23:50:01] <sonny> no
[23:50:11] <[itchyjunk]> i guess it does avoid some runtime error issues
[23:50:15] <flakland> it can compute the real value of sqrt(2) ?
[23:50:20] <[itchyjunk]> if there is a refrence, i can be sure it's not null
[23:50:30] <[itchyjunk]> define "real value of sqrt(2)"
[23:50:41] <flakland> define "anything"
[23:50:50] <[itchyjunk]> sqrt(2) is a value.
[23:50:57] <[itchyjunk]> It's a symbol representating a number.

[23:51:39] <[itchyjunk]> anything here means it can computer anything constructable, probably
[23:51:59] <sonny> null is available for pointers, but not references in rust
[23:52:34] <[itchyjunk]> ah, i don't know the difference
[23:52:39] <[itchyjunk]> java only had refrences
[23:52:45] <[itchyjunk]> i think py also only had refrences?
[23:52:48] <[itchyjunk]> idk wtf haskell has
[23:52:54] <[itchyjunk]> html has none of it
[23:53:07] <sonny> pointers in rust don't have safety guarantees iirc
[23:53:21] <sonny> but otherwise they are pretty much the same thing
[23:53:21] <[itchyjunk]> type safety? or some other safety?

[23:53:40] <[itchyjunk]> hmm idk what that means either
[23:53:54] <[itchyjunk]> ah so you have to manually allocate and free up memory.
[23:53:59] <[itchyjunk]> I kinda wanna learn that kinda stuff.
[23:54:05] <[itchyjunk]> I was thinking of picking up C to learn it.

[23:56:30] <nomagno> Well, accessing memory you haven't allocated and allocating memory then losing references to it

[23:56:37] <[itchyjunk]> I would have thought most languages would keep track of refrences
