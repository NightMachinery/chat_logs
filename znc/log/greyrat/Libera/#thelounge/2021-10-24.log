[00:00:39] <themingtest> Activ8: it doesn't make sense right now, that's why I'm on :)
[00:00:58] <Activ8> what doesn't make sense?
[00:01:09] <themingtest> making a screenshot
[00:01:17] <themingtest> without actual chat
[00:02:09] <Activ8> just hop into one of the active rooms like libera or something?
[00:02:24] <themingtest> worth a shot
[00:03:24] <Activ8> there's currently 2222 users on libera.
[00:04:16] <bookworm> Activ8: re delete, I think yes, that or rewrite properly. Then again that's just my personal opinion
[00:05:18] <bookworm> themingtest: just load scrollback on a public channel... you run TL right so chances are you have a sqlite db
[00:05:55] * themingtest selfhosting
[00:05:56] <Activ8> why didn't I think of that, good shout
[00:06:37] <bookworm> so? self hosting doesn't imply not having scrollback ;) what do you think I'm doing?
[00:07:02] <themingtest> scrollback requires to be on that channel long ago, doesn't it?
[00:07:16] <bookworm> for a single screen of messages, no
[00:07:48] <Activ8> 😄
[00:07:48] <themingtest> is there an irc server command which loads the scrollback just I'm not aware of?
[00:08:08] <bookworm> yes, but no. chat history is nor supported on libera
[00:08:34] <Activ8> have you just started using this themingtest? you won't get scroll back if you haven't been on long not in small rooms anyway
[00:08:44] <Activ8> How's your progression with the theme coming along?
[00:09:02] <themingtest> promising :)
[00:09:52] <themingtest> I had to inspect the source how to put other files than the theme.css into my theme package
[00:10:20] <Activ8> ofc
[00:10:24] <Activ8> I do that
[00:10:34] <themingtest> not a single theme available on npm actually leveraged that feature
[00:11:00] <themingtest> and I couldn't find it in the how-to-theme page as well
[00:11:34] <themingtest> but at least the feature is there, otherwise I'd made a PR
[00:13:09] <Activ8> do you mean referencing other css files inside a css file?
[00:13:19] <themingtest> nope, a font
[00:13:22] <Activ8> oh
[00:13:33] <Activ8> yeh got ya
[00:13:40] <themingtest> have a look: http://deejayy.hu/share/paste-20211023-224334.png
[00:13:57] <bookworm> a fiiles section in the thelounge package.json entry
[00:14:09] <themingtest> bookworm: yeah, figured :)
[00:14:27] <Activ8> cool something different
[00:14:42] <themingtest> so it's at a very initial state, have to fine-tune some things
[00:14:43] <bookworm> gruvbox 😄 but with an ugly font
[00:14:52] <themingtest> it' monokai
[00:14:55] <themingtest> it's
[00:15:08] <bookworm> ah right, that looks similar
[00:15:11] <Activ8> I've been maintaining thelounge-theme-flat-blue and thelounge-theme-flat-dark for a while now, just done some fixes for 4.3.0 in the last week
[00:15:22] <themingtest> and "ugly" is the classic 8x16 ascii font
[00:15:29] <bookworm> yes, exactly
[00:15:45] <Activ8> I don't think I can get away with that theme but each to there own and I'm sure someone else will
[00:15:47] <bookworm> word of advice, tone down the divider.. as in dim them
[00:17:10] <themingtest> I'm planning an irssi skin as well ;]
[00:17:39] <themingtest> I mean, irssi skin for lounge
[00:17:44] <Activ8> I'm not familiure with irssi

[18:52:24] <Activ8> you might want to test it on mobile, I had couple changes I needed to do to mine to get things working on mobile, there's a couple fixes for ios with rounded search edge bugs and there's been one for the side user list 
[18:52:59] <bookworm> Activ8: that shouldn't matter for a theme (the rounding issues) that's something to be fixed in core
[18:53:16] <Activ8> oh yeh I know was just saying just in case they come across it
[18:53:26] <Activ8> I was confused for ages when I did mine
[18:54:10] <Activ8> they fixed in core now anyway the PR and merge was done I believe

[20:03:35] <Activ8> I may have a play with fonts myself see how different things look
[20:06:47] <bookworm> note that you may be better off by using a google / other cdn font rather than bundling it. That way the chances are higher that it is already cached

[20:16:45] <deejayy^> btw that was my first try :)
[20:16:50] <bookworm> is it?
[20:17:29] <deejayy^> and also, it is my font, doesn't exist on any cdn
[20:17:43] <Activ8> 😆
[20:19:14] <bookworm> did you try with a https link? That should work for fonts 		"font-src 'self' https:", // allow loading fonts from secure sites (e.g. google fonts)

[21:44:50] <MiniDigger> 👋
[21:44:51] <MiniDigger> apparently somebody missed me?
[21:45:20] <MiniDigger> its been a while since I last used irc, lol
[21:45:29] <MiniDigger> took me a minute to realize freenode did implode 
[21:45:49] <Activ8> well hello there
[21:46:14] <Activ8> Everyone missed you 🤗
[21:46:19] <MiniDigger> ah, you missed me, didn't remember your IRC nick :D
[21:46:27] <Activ8> you won't lol
[21:46:31] <Activ8> secret
[21:46:34] <Activ8> ha ha
[21:47:07] <MiniDigger> well, sadly (I guess?) I was forced to use discord (for access to internal channels which werent briged) so I kinda gave up on irc
[21:47:35] <Activ8> you used to use IRC at work?
[21:47:41] <MiniDigger> irc feels so much differently, since you don't get any indication that anyone else is around, its pretty much just screaming into the void
[21:48:10] <MiniDigger> prolly better for my productivity that I don't anymore :D
[21:48:11] <Activ8> ... and that's why it's so much better than discord, less distractions
[21:48:17] <Activ8> discord is a pita for work
[21:48:18] <Activ8> IMO
[21:50:06] <MiniDigger> I just don't use discord at work, its blocked at company proxy anyways
[21:50:28] <MiniDigger> so I can only use my phone, which is a pita so I don't, only when its urgent or am like staring at the pipeline 
[21:50:31] <Activ8> anyway MiniDigger you know the score, you might get a slapped hand if you don't talk about TL.  So you might be best off heading to #thelounge-offtopic lol
[21:50:35] <Activ8> 🛩️
