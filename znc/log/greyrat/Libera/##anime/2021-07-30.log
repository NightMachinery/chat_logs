[10:07:34] <amigojapan> Nanobot: that's confusing
[10:07:38] <MootPoot> My work  breakdown
[10:07:42] <MootPoot> 20% writing code
[10:07:55] <MootPoot> 60% fixing shit that dosent work
[10:07:58] <MootPoot> 20% meetings
[10:08:38] <PancakeMatsuri> MootPoot it might be the system that's to blame
[10:08:50] <MootPoot> I blame microsfot
[10:08:56] <MootPoot> their docs are shit
[10:09:09] <PancakeMatsuri> do you have automated tests?
[10:09:12] <MootPoot> missing portions, gaps in the guides, outdated infos
[10:09:14] <MootPoot> AHAHAHHAHAHHA
[10:09:15] <MootPoot> no
[10:09:33] <PancakeMatsuri> there's your answer
[10:09:45] <jessedesu_onaph> I'm intrigued by sailor saturn
[10:09:48] <MootPoot> PancakeMatsuri: problem is that this is all in the feature implementation stage
[10:09:51] *** Quits: coeus (~coeus@216.sub-174-205-225.myvzw.com) (Read error: No route to host)
[10:09:56] <MootPoot> so its not that a feature is breaking something else
[10:10:12] <amigojapan> jessedesu_onaph: what about her?
[10:10:23] <MootPoot> its that trying to make things work is breaking the same thing I'm trying to work
[10:10:33] <PancakeMatsuri> MootPoot you don't even get recurring bugs?
[10:10:37] <MootPoot> nah
[10:10:51] <MootPoot> only recurring bug is with management
[10:10:55] <MootPoot> lol
[10:11:04] <PancakeMatsuri> hmm
[10:11:11] <MootPoot> and building locally
[10:11:13] <jessedesu_onaph> I dunno amigo, ever since seeing that plastic love remix cover art
[10:11:16] <MootPoot> but thats a different deal
[10:11:22] <PancakeMatsuri> well, it's natural that things braek
[10:11:27] <MootPoot> MOSTLY my problems to this date have been due to shit docs
[10:11:35] <MootPoot> or maybe my brain is low IQ

[10:12:22] <amigojapan> Yep Jesse
[10:12:29] <PancakeMatsuri> I've been told by the client they don't expect to have any problems with my code, and then they had problems
[10:12:32] <amigojapan> MootPoot: let me see
[10:12:35] <jessedesu_onaph> But is she 12
[10:13:52] <amigojapan> Jesse but really cause in the sailor moon universe time does go by
[10:14:10] <amigojapan> Not really*
[10:14:18] <amigojapan> Yeah time goes by
[10:14:30] <jessedesu_onaph> Time goes by
[10:14:44] <jessedesu_onaph> Fast
[10:14:57] <amigojapan> jessedesu_onaph: which means she was 12 in the 90s
[10:14:58] <jessedesu_onaph> We lose a second every second
[10:15:18] <jessedesu_onaph> I was 12 in 1997
[10:15:37] <amigojapan> So your ages are not so different
[10:15:48] <jessedesu_onaph> Sailormoon was 1992
[10:15:51] <CyberTailor> MootPoot: : there should be something like that but with programming languages (sweaty speadrunner and caption "rewriting rust in rust")
[10:16:23] <amigojapan> Jesse sailor Saturn did not appear till several seasons in
[10:16:52] <CyberTailor> no, entire video in that format about rust
[10:16:56] <jessedesu_onaph> Is it one of the original 5 sailors
[10:17:05] <jessedesu_onaph> Or are there 6
[10:17:18] <amigojapan> No Jesse, she is an outer senshi
[10:17:38] <jessedesu_onaph> Senshi?
[10:17:49] <amigojapan> There are 5 inner senshi
[10:18:03] <amigojapan> Senshi means warrior
[10:18:18] <jessedesu_onaph> Is Uranus one of them
[10:18:22] <amigojapan> Sailor senshi
[10:18:47] <amigojapan> Uranus is an outer senshi
[10:19:05] <jessedesu_onaph> O:
[10:19:30] <amigojapan> jessedesu_onaph: the five inner senshi are moon mars Mercury Venus and Jupiter
[10:19:31] <jessedesu_onaph> Does it have to do with the order of the planets
[10:19:44] <amigojapan> I think so

[10:20:59] <amigojapan> MootPoot: if it is an actual Linux it is good
[10:21:36] <amigojapan> Jesse maybe you should watch sailor moon?
[10:21:37] <MootPoot> well, it seems to be a server OS
[10:22:02] <amigojapan> MootPoot: as long as it is GPL

[10:22:28] <jessedesu_onaph> I got to episode 23
[10:22:34] <amigojapan> MootPoot: yeah Microsoft failed at writing their own server software
[10:22:50] <amigojapan> I see Jesse
[10:23:30] <amigojapan> That 10 percent Jesse
[10:23:33] <MootPoot> Windows server is still a thing though
[10:23:45] <amigojapan> MootPoot: it sucks
[10:23:46] <MootPoot> as well as M$ SQL and ASP.NET
[10:24:13] <MootPoot> sure, but "it sucks" =/= failed at writing it 
[10:24:43] <amigojapan> MootPoot: but Linux is not successful at adoption as a server
[10:24:44] <MootPoot> it does work and has been working for many years,it just may have not been very good ( idk I'm not a server person )
[10:24:52] <jessedesu_onaph> 200 episodes eh
[10:25:01] <jessedesu_onaph> That's a huge download

[10:30:46] <MootPoot> a linux only future would be okay though
[10:30:49] <rando25892> everytime i see something interesting and i hear they have a hard time installing linux on a blog i remove it from my feed
[10:30:50] <MootPoot> I'd be fine with that
[10:31:20] <amigojapan> MootPoot: well UNIX was never meant to be used without a system administrator
[10:31:58] <MootPoot> its funny how the only consumer-popular version of unix had to be un-unixified ( at least in principle )

[10:33:11] <amigojapan> MootPoot: Mac is pretty can UNIX in the command line

[10:33:56] * MootPoot needs to learn how to use grep
[10:34:03] <MootPoot> maybe this weekend
[10:34:08] <PancakeMatsuri> well, devs need all that Linux stuff. so that's part of its popularity 
[10:34:19] <MootPoot> linux has its place
[10:34:47] <MootPoot> but imo a lot of people keep on dreaming about a linux and open source future while completely ignoring why other systems got popular in the first place
[10:34:57] <rando25892> weird thing though is the learning curve once you figure it out you wont talk about the same hurdles its positive 
[10:35:16] <MootPoot> rando25892: sure, I agree
[10:35:23] <amigojapan> MootPoot: Android is Linux

[10:47:15] <MootPoot> pizza is coming
[10:49:03] <MootPoot> amigojapan: I always wondered why raspberry pi decided to use broadcom of all things
[10:49:18] <MootPoot> rather then like a plain jane ARM or allwinner
[10:49:27] <MootPoot> broadcom is known for not being very...good
[10:49:37] <MootPoot> in terms of openess with their documents
[10:50:16] <amigojapan> MootPoot: the company is evil
[10:50:29] <MootPoot> broadcom or raspberry?
[10:50:49] <amigojapan> Both but raspberry too
[10:51:41] <MootPoot> I wonder where I would start understanding ARM chips more in detail
[10:51:49] <rando25892> yea if they did show the code but didnt comment good it would be figure out i dont think they release source code
[10:52:11] <MootPoot> afaik a lot of ARM chipmakers are like that
[10:52:36] <MootPoot> quallcomm releases a good amount of docs ( but their stuff is $$$ )
[10:52:51] <MootPoot> broadcom, mediatek are both really closed off
[10:52:56] <MootPoot> they dont document well or share stuff
[10:52:57] <rando25892> mediatek is the shit
[10:53:00] <MootPoot> samsung too
[10:53:03] <rando25892> id get the lenovo duet 
[10:53:12] <rando25892> it depends all on the graphics 
[10:53:14] <MootPoot> rando25892:  they are nice and cheap
[10:53:19] <MootPoot> but that's not the problem
[10:53:28] <rando25892> ofc it is
[10:53:30] <MootPoot> problem is they keep everything closed source
[10:53:48] <rando25892> its going to take years for the graphics driver to develop if they do the stuff in the background about it
[10:53:55] <MootPoot> its really hard to get ROMs for mediatek based stuff
[10:53:59] <MootPoot> wym graphic driver
[10:54:09] <MootPoot> literally all they need is just source code and docs
[10:54:47] <rando25892> for arm chips theres a graphics socket on chip
[10:54:54] <rando25892> its does hardware decoding
[10:55:16] <MootPoot> yeah but I dont see how that is specifically the problem
[10:55:23] <rando25892> they release binaries but it sucks to use with linux distros

[10:57:42] <rando25892> but i wouldnt use an rpi to run video like i would the arm laptops that do
[10:58:34] <rando25892> it doesnt compare to x86 but its just funny how affordable it is . it takes effort to get the setup running . so x86 is way easier to have it there and going
[10:58:47] <rando25892> and faster stronger
[10:58:50] <rando25892> almost everything better

[15:17:46] <Cryowolf> I need to set up a gofundme or something for people who don
[15:17:49] <Cryowolf> dont have paypal
[15:20:43] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: then maybe you can also post it on forums
[15:27:35] <Katrin> Cryowolf: Make sure to inform yourself how to legally get the money, a friend of mine had money from a donation locked by her bank because she wasn't aware of regulations arount international wire transferes
[15:27:37] <Urchin[emacs]> JesseDesu: hi
[15:28:08] <Katrin> And paypal sometimes locks funds when they deem something suspicious
[15:28:17] <Publios> yeah
[15:28:30] <Cryowolf> the paypalme description is fairly self-explanatory
[15:28:31] <Katrin> I am not sure how much of that work gofundme covers
[15:29:17] <Cryowolf> I don't know. I'm gonna try and find out
[15:30:06] <Cryowolf> but I have nothing now and I have to rely on the kindness of strangers. Something I hope is out there
[15:30:29] <Katrin> It is out there
[15:31:12] <Katrin> But getting attention is really up to chance outsides of communities that already know you.
[15:32:07] <Cryowolf> I don't know. I will use whatever resource I have and try to get it spread into other communities by people who have some influence
[15:32:27] <Katrin> I wish you the best of luck
[15:32:35] <Cryowolf> thank you
[15:32:48] <Katrin> Still recommend asking your local authorities how to declare this stuff
[15:33:04] <Cryowolf> not that easy
[15:33:15] <Cryowolf> I can't visit their crowded offices
[15:33:28] <Katrin> I know that I can't really do that here
[15:33:46] <Katrin> if I would collect donations for anything I would get my benefits cut
[15:34:15] <Cryowolf> I guess I will ask about that too
[15:34:34] <Cryowolf> there's a certain limit to how much I can get before its reduced or cut
[15:34:49] <Katrin> Yeah that can be an issue when you receive large donations
[15:34:52] <Katrin> which happens
[15:34:53] <Cryowolf> but if this has to do with very small cash (like 100-200 euro)
[15:35:02] <Cryowolf> then I doubt much will happen
[15:35:04] <Cryowolf> if that
[15:35:06] <Cryowolf> sthe total
[15:36:12] <Katrin> Well it can happen, just take my word for it
[15:36:35] <Katrin> And also, if the limits are anything like in Germany
[15:36:52] <Katrin> You cannot receive much money to begin with
[15:37:14] <Katrin> Here you can earn 100€ a month before they start deducing it from your benefits
[15:37:34] <Katrin> THat is for the unemployed and those on disability benefits
[15:38:28] <death916> US does that too idk the exact amount but u have to declare money you get and if its over certain amount they just lower benefits
[15:42:23] <Cryowolf> Katrin, I have permanent "sjukersättning" which can only be paused, not removed
[15:42:31] <Cryowolf> but it's existential minimum
[15:42:45] <Cryowolf> so it just about covers food and bills
[15:42:48] <Cryowolf> nothing extra
