[08:09:40] <tag> e36freak: I believe it was discovered first about two months ago. *Seemingly*, hard to be sure
[08:10:19] <e36freak> yeah you have no idea who discovered it and never disclosed it though
[08:10:21] <tag> Still this affects all the companies basically, I've been chasing down attack vectors for hours today

[08:14:15] <pr3d4t0r> tag: And, queries for what?
[08:15:28] <pr3d4t0r> tag: The last DSL I played with was N1QL, for Couchbase Server.  It obviated most cases of JavaScript queries, fairly fast.
[08:15:37] <tag> Yes... For querying model simulations across real observations at the scale of trillions of events
[08:15:53] <pr3d4t0r> tag: What problem domain?

[21:04:29] <tangy> can awk print a line in a text file based on whether a string in only the 3rd column (rather than the 4th) matches a regex?
[21:07:22] <tangy> oh, it's okay. I'll have to pick this up again later. thanks
[21:09:48] <emanuele6> tangy: what do you mean?
[21:10:14] <emanuele6> i don't understand the "rather than the 4th" part
[21:10:36] <emanuele6> if you want to print a whole like if the 3rd field matches a regex, that is just:
[21:10:43] <emanuele6>   awk '$3 ~ /re/'
[21:14:30] <nmz1> tangy: to print in a text file, you can use print "string" > file
[21:14:40] <nmz1> tangy: > will overwrite the file, >> will append to it
[21:22:19] <nmz1> Which is probably not what you meant, but strangely, is exactly what you wrote
[21:24:26] <emanuele6> s/like/line/
[21:27:16] <emanuele6> one could think tangy meant:   awk -vre='re' '$3 ~ re && $4 !~ re { print > "file" }'
[21:27:30] <emanuele6> the question is hard to understand
[21:29:32] <emanuele6> or even { a = $3; $3 = "" } a ~ re && $0 !~ re { print > "file" }
[21:30:58] <emanuele6> err, i meant { line = $0; a = $3; $3 = "" } a ~ re && $0 !~ re { print line > "file" }
[21:32:12] <emanuele6> i.e. if the third field matches the regex `re' and the rest of the line with $3 omitted does not match re, print the whole line to a file named "file"
