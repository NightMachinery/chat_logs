[00:23:33] <Speeder> I never use rebase because it confuses me and I never figured out what it does. thing is now I am working on large projects with tons of people and people DO use rebase in some situations so I would like to know more. 1. There is a project (not mine) that I am helping test a pull request, someone asked on comments: "Can someone rebase master here?" what that person means? 2. Is rebase the right tool to make sure a branch I am working
[00:23:33] <Speeder> on for a while is in sync with changes on master? 3. I saw in another project this phrase: "just make a pull request, I will rebase for you before I merge." what that person means?
[00:23:44] <mackerman> yolo_: git diff -- x  ~/some/other/x
[00:24:27] <yolo_> mackerman: no, i just issued 'git diff master x' at the top directory(where .git resides) but there is a subfolder also named x
[00:25:03] <yolo_> how can you git-diff a local branch to another folder that is not even part of git?
[00:25:20] <mackerman> Speeder: Rebase means to undo what you did, and reapply it as if the other branch were at a different point.
[00:25:43] <mackerman> git can diff files not in a repo, it can replace  generic diff.
[00:25:49] <yolo_> i have always been running git within the same .git repo, never across two .git, not sure if it's even possible, guess not

[02:42:16] <ikke> Yes, it knows what commit it points at, but it's a symbolic ref, which means it points at a branch
[02:42:48] <ikke> That info is not transferred over the protocol, so git infers it with some heuristics
[02:43:07] <wombawomba> no, it is definitely transferred

[17:59:38] <rockyh> Hello! I'm trying to use git CLI `gh' to perform some of the operations available in the web interface. I would like to add or to edit the `description' of a repository, but I didn't find anything useful in the `git repo' section in the manual: https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo
[17:59:47] <rockyh> is this operation possible through the CLI? If yes, how?
