[00:43:09] <rawtaz> sounds reasonable. i dont know, but check the `run` arguments
[00:43:13] <rawtaz> what problem are you trying to solve?
[00:44:01] <JayDoubleu> running container on disposable VM mainly for chroot capabilities and not sandboxing. 
[00:44:09] <JayDoubleu> So I want it to have access to all devices/ proc etc etc
[00:44:37] <rawtaz> if all you want is chroot, why not just use chroot?
[00:45:09] <JayDoubleu> Chroots dont have dockerfiles ;)
[00:45:34] <rawtaz> indeed

[17:36:42] <LordKalma> they are sharing the volume, files are updated on said volume, but one of the services doesn't know about it? 
[17:37:42] <LordKalma> I *suspect* nginx doesn't know the files have been updated and serves some internally cached version of them... Which doesn't make much sense to.
[17:38:00] <tabakhase> LordKalma volumes "only populate ONCE" - option a) no volume, you can use "COPY --from=other:image /bla /blub" to pull the ressources from one to another --- option b) store files on build into /usr/src/myapp, then have your entrypoint rsync(--delete) from /usr/src/myapp to /path/with/volume
[17:39:28] <tabakhase> so, while "volumes are the right thing to share between containers" - it does NOT work "to share files that were part of the container" so to say (as youd never get updates ever again)
[17:39:35] *** Joins: tex (~super@user/dix)
[17:39:47] <LordKalma> can I ask what do you mean with only populate once? let's imagine a single service/volume. When the imagine re-runs it doesn«t update the data?
[17:39:56] <LordKalma> tabakhase, the updating is part of the entry point, not the image
[17:40:02] <LordKalma> (if that matters)
[17:40:38] <tabakhase> "on first use" a volume will copy over whats in the path at the container ((hence why you dont see it "empty")) --- note that only volumes do that, bind-mounts do not
[17:40:38] <LordKalma>  When the image re-runs it doesn't update the files?* (given that building is on the entrypoint)
[17:41:59] <LordKalma> okay, I understand the bit about the "first use" thing... But again, I'm generating the files on the entrypoint
[17:42:06] <LordKalma> so the volume is already mounted at that point
[17:42:16] <LordKalma> it's not being populated, but modified
[17:42:41] <tabakhase> tghen you are trying to re-modify files yu had modified last week already
[17:42:47] <tabakhase> it realy couldnt be any different tbh - how would it know what you want updated or not ;-)
[17:43:14] <LordKalma> no, let's take a step back. and clear something
[17:43:30] <LordKalma> for example, a postgres container: you'd say `volumes: postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/`
[17:43:31] <LordKalma> right?
[17:43:39] <LordKalma> and the postgres container will modify it all the time
[17:43:49] <LordKalma> you can poiwer it down, and up, and the data is there, modified, and all
[17:43:58] <LordKalma> so far so good, right?
[17:44:30] <tabakhase> that is "reusing the same old files on new containers" yes
[17:44:45] <tabakhase> (and in the image, /var/lib/postgresql/data/ actually starts out empty)
[17:44:47] <LordKalma> okay, good. 
[17:45:26] <LordKalma> yes, I know it starts empty
[17:45:39] <LordKalma> that's why I made it clear that my build process is part of the entrypoint script
[17:45:41] <LordKalma> not the Dockerfile
[17:45:56] <LordKalma> so let's forget my "bug" for a sec
[17:46:18] <LordKalma> oh wait
[17:46:19] <LordKalma> fuck
[17:46:22] <LordKalma> I know what the bug is
[17:46:43] <LordKalma> while the build is NOT part of the dockerfile, but the entrypoint
[17:46:56] <LordKalma> the COPY . . *IS* part of the dockerfile
[17:47:05] <LordKalma> and that's the bit that just stays old
[17:47:17] <LordKalma> the build is fresh, the files it's building with aren't

[17:48:41] <LordKalma>  ---> Using cache
[17:48:48] <LordKalma> URGH YOU SNEAKY LITTLE BASTAR
[17:49:04] <LordKalma> not even up --build fixes it
[17:49:20] <LordKalma> (which I was already using)
[17:49:55] <tabakhase> one of the best examples is usually "think of a .htaccess file in a "user-uploads" directory" - you need a volume to keep the users runtime files, while also keeping that htaccess updated, and worse if user bindmounts instead of volumes he not only would have a "outdated" htaccess, but in fact NONE - and all those cases need to be put in line
[17:50:11] <tabakhase> and COPY (from context to image) is likely not the issue
[17:50:54] <tabakhase> "image to container" your old volume just squats over whatever you had put in
[17:51:30] <tabakhase> and if you say "my entry does that already", feel free to share smth to look at :P cause without dockerfile/entrypoint that is a bit stuck...
[17:51:52] <LordKalma> I think the problem is that I have WORKDIR /frontend and frontend_data:/frontend/
[17:52:02] <LordKalma> if I volume-mount JUST the build dir
[17:52:05] <LordKalma> it probably will work
[17:52:37] <tabakhase> COPY to /frontend/ = bad --- COPY TO /ur/src/frontend/ and ENTRYPOINT with `rsync -a --delete /ur/src/frontend/ /frontend/` = better
[17:53:18] <LordKalma> what about copy to frontend/ and ONLY volume mount frontend/dist? :D
[17:53:22] <tabakhase> (and you can flip that as you like, maybe keeping "/ur/src/frontend/" as target and just moving the volume to /var/shared/ur/src/frontend/ fits more in your boat :shrug:
[17:53:23] <LordKalma> (the build dir)

[18:01:22] <tabakhase> "by chance" that likely would cut as you npm run build in the entry yea ---- but this will give you a heap of problems elsewhere later on ;D - i stroooooongly recommend to fix that first ;D
[18:02:25] <LordKalma> bahhhhh okay :D
[18:02:42] <LordKalma> anyway, thank you very much again for both the rubber duck service, and the nice pointers
[18:03:03] <tabakhase> startup time, beeing able to rollback/forth, and beeing safe from left_pad is worth it :D
[18:03:06] <tabakhase> np =)

[18:03:51] <LordKalma> actually, the startup time thing... yeah... not caching `npm run build` is annoying
[18:04:01] <LordKalma> but it's a projet in the making, so there isn't a lot to cache anyway
[18:04:08] <LordKalma> I reload the code faster than my VPS reboots haha
[18:06:28] <tabakhase> ye "in dev" nothing wrong with just bindmounting the whole thing and using "docker exec" wherever needed :D  (((if you node-serve you may want exec build && stop (so that then restart-policy can take over and fire it back up again) or such))
[18:06:50] <LordKalma> if you ntoice, I have another docker-compose for dev
[18:07:04] <LordKalma> I dev in my machine and pull in the server when it makes sense
[18:07:20] <LordKalma> the dev docker-compose has hot reloading and the webpack server running

[18:10:15] <LordKalma> and that's part of why building is part of the entry point
[18:10:24] <LordKalma> there's a dev entrypoint and a prod entrypoint

In the container network, you can use --network-alias on the container running that service so anything on the same docker network as it will get that container's ip instead of whatever you put as a real DNS name. The host's /etc/hosts won't affect
[19:01:57] <programmerq> resolution in the container.

[22:14:09] <tabakhase> afaik that rule/convention/pattern is not a thing over here, at least i saw a bunch of channels "remove the extra #" during the move
[22:14:32] <njka> tabakhase: it is a thing... the libera staff have it documented on the website
[22:14:58] <njka> tabakhase: but it's def not an issue for this channel
[22:15:48] <tabakhase> "Channels that begin with only a single # character are either project or community channels. Channels that begin with two # characters are informal channels."
[22:15:55] <tabakhase> so it means smth enirely different
[22:18:18] <njka> hmmm... "The registration should be either done by or have received the official blessing of someone who is able to speak for the project. This could be:"
[22:18:24] <njka> https://libera.chat/chanreg/
[22:19:17] <njka> oh
[22:19:22] <njka> but... "Community channels are reserved for on-topic channels as per our community groups. An official claim to the name is not needed, but not having it bears the risk of losing the channel should an on-topic entity with a valid claim start an official presence on Libera.Chat."
[22:20:11] <njka> so yeah, i think this chan falls 100% under "Community channel" criteria :)
[22:21:36] <njka> i would honestly be surprised if a company registered an irc channel these days actually... most of the company registered social groups are done via slack i would imagine
[22:21:55] <njka> i used to talk to the mesosphere folks via slack back in the day
[22:21:58] <tabakhase> to lazy to hunt out archive.org - but from memory "over there" community was NOT on the same level as project/company
[22:22:49] <njka> tabakhase: are you referring to freentuz ? :)
[22:23:38] <tabakhase> yep
[22:23:44] <njka> anyway, according to the libera site and their criteria... this channel is 100% legit community channel :)
