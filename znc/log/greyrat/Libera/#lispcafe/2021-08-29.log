[02:49:23] <gilberth> I wonder if kmonad could make my left alt the meta key and right alt the alt for accessing another layer of the keyboard layout. And if, how? It's trivial with Linux, but macOS has no idea of a meta key to begin with. So alt is used for that. I have the hunch, that a kext is too early in the game to fix that. E.g. karabiner cannot do that and no alternate keyboard layout either. There are just no modifier bit left to have alt, meta, sup

[03:26:00] <gilberth> Would it be possible to write a program which looks at logic diagrams in datasheets and turn it into verilog? Like this one: <http://clim.rocks/gilbert/74AS882.png>
[03:26:12] *** Quits: selwyn (~selwyn@user/selwyn) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[03:27:35] <gilberth> It's tedious to do this by hand. I like to work from those logic diagrams, although they are not always correct.
[03:27:39] <hayley> IIRC some fork of Logisim had that but you had to draw the circuit diagram yourself. I'd check if someone else wrote it up already for now.

[03:29:29] <hayley> I hope not.
[03:30:29] <dave0> hayley: there's starting to be news stories that catching covid and recovering is as good at giving you immunity as a vaccine
[03:30:50] <hayley> That would make sense, but the only problem is you have to survive COVID.

[03:47:56] <hayley> The former.
[03:48:11] <gilberth> Decision made. ;)
[03:48:53] <kakuhen> i think most people would fear novel diseases with no known treatments
[03:49:23] <kakuhen> unless you're somebody who doesn't understand statistics and thinks improbable = impossible
[03:49:47] <gilberth> I still don't get it why people don't want to get vaccinated in general.
[03:49:49] <kakuhen> "dude only 1% of people with my age, weight, height, sex, ... died from covid; i'll be safe!!"
[03:50:20] <hayley> Your calling conventions on Go: https://twitter.com/brianhatfield/status/1430910860764094464
[03:50:51] <kakuhen> gilberth: what confuses me more is how people who claim to not be afraid of a "disease with < 1% death rate" are somehow scared of a vaccine with a << 1% death rate.
[03:51:07] <gilberth> kakuhen: People are bad at math. And they still don't get what exponential grows entails.
[03:51:23] <kakuhen> >person dies of covid
[03:51:27] <kakuhen> >noooo he died WITH covid! fake  news!!
[03:51:38] <kakuhen> >vaccinated person dies for any reason at all
[03:51:43] <kakuhen> >SEE? VACCINES ARE DANGEROUS! IT KILLED THEM
[03:51:49] <kakuhen> it's all so tiresome.
[03:52:09] <gilberth> kakuhen: Come on, you can't tell me, that 40% fear the vaccine. More than COVID. And, I keep repeating myself: Even when you survive, there is long-covid.
[03:52:39] <dave0> i don't like "you got covid and recovered? get vaccinated anyway"
[03:52:49] <kakuhen> gilberth: yeah i've heard of some people who still have side effects that last months after covid infection
[03:53:06] <gilberth> They may believe it's like the flu, without ever having had a real one, either.
[03:53:12] <kakuhen> i wonder how they feel when they see people say things like "haha it's just a stronger flu :))"
[03:54:25] <kakuhen> dave0: well, antibodies don't last forever sadly. it may make sense to get a vaccine 6-8 months after you recovered.
[03:54:54] <gilberth> kakuhen: Exactly. And they cannot work anymore. They feel like me, needing a rest after less a half-dozen stair cases. Congrat! And simple things like brushing teeth are exhausting calling for another break. Congrats, again! And nobody knows how long it'll last yet.
[03:55:01] <kakuhen> i also recall seeing some paper noting that people who recovered from covid really only need one Pfizer or Moderna vaccine and dont benefit much from getting a second shot
[03:55:13] <kakuhen> havent seen any follow ups to it however
[03:56:46] <gilberth> Having a third shot is actively discussed here. I'd love to get one in a few month. Man, was I happy after my first shot. At a time, where there was strict prioritization in effect and vaccine scarce.
[03:58:22] <gilberth> On one hand, I have a low risk, as I don't leave the house. otoh I am at high risk to land in hospital or die, when unlucky.
[03:58:37] <kakuhen> im scared of needles so i got the j&j vaccine, which only needed one dose thankfully
[03:58:40] <lotuseater> :(
[03:59:32] <kakuhen> allegedly most vaccines are effective for at least 6-8 months or so, and i got vaccinated around april 27
[03:59:33] <gilberth> What people also keep forgetting: How they'd feel, when they would infect their grandpa and he would die, because they took all those precautions too lightly.
[04:01:04] <gilberth> kakuhen: You and hayley should found a club. I am out. I was very scared of needles, too. Hopsital with one or two of them, also iv, cured me.
[04:01:38] <gilberth> * each day.
[04:02:00] <gilberth> And drips.
[04:03:15] <kakuhen> i had to get a blood test a few years back for some hormonal level thingy and that wasnt very fun either
[04:03:24] <kakuhen> it was the first blood test i've ever gotten, or recall at least
[04:03:37] <kakuhen> eyes squinted tightly, lasted about 30 seconds and my arm just felt awful for the rest of the day.
[04:04:03] <kakuhen> and the nurse or whoever was doing it jokingly told me "oh good thing your skin is so pale, this should be quick!"
[04:04:06] <kakuhen> OK ACTUALLY MAKE IT QUICK THEN
[04:04:14] <kakuhen> i still vividly remember the entire thing
[04:05:51] <gilberth> Was it quick?
[04:05:55] <kakuhen> not for me.
[04:06:10] <kakuhen> it was definitely done under a minute though, but each second felt so slow in my mind.
[04:06:33] <kakuhen> once it was done i accidentally saw part of the vial too and swiftly turned the other direction.
[04:07:18] <gilberth> Well, a blood sample always was the pure horror for me, although they find the blood vessel on the first try. And: I am not afraid of pain. Doesn't hurt anyway.
[04:07:50] <kakuhen> i also had to wait hours just to wait for some "preliminary results" of the test
[04:07:55] <gilberth> And nurses do it way better than doctors.
[04:08:01] <kakuhen> i have no idea what they even actually checked because the first thing I was told was "you are slightly dehydrated"
[04:08:24] <kakuhen> apparently they also looked at my hemoglobin levels and that can somehow imply dehydrtation
[04:08:28] <kakuhen> despite the fact I drink so much water daily...

[05:10:44] <kakuhen> gilberth: regarding your example, the sane choice would be to define "10." as a number with two significant figures

[05:12:26] <moon-child> 'significant figures' not so interesting as 'error margins'
[05:13:13] <gilberth> kakuhen: It's not so easy, as SVG allows for wsp to be droped. "L1.2.3.4" then is what? "L 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0"? "L 1.2 0.3 0.4"? Or sth else?
[05:13:44] <gilberth> So I am in trial and error land again to see what implementations do.
[05:14:00] <moon-child> gilberth: generally tokenization is 'greedy'; you consume as many characters as you can in a token
[05:14:05] <gilberth> I wish a spec would indicate at least the syntax, dammit.
[05:14:10] <moon-child> so L 1.2 0.3 0.4
[05:14:47] <moon-child> (Or, possibly, L1 0.2 0.3 0.4?  Idk if that makes sense in svg)
[05:15:53] <gilberth> moon-child: The EBNF does NOT allow a decimal fraction, only an integer. Yet, decimal fractions are ok as coordinates, the spec even does say so, but gives no grammar. And of course matching is, unless you use those brain-dead Perl REs: Longest match wins.

[10:15:35] <hayley> One problem with the totally-not-one-bit reference count in thread local heaps: you still need to scan all the registers and stack. So I guess some static analysis to avoid it would still help.
[10:16:31] <hayley> Another is that if we reuse the mark bitmap as suggested in the 1-bit paper, with something like the older-to-newer reference rule, we have to clear the bitmap before marking, and probably regenerate it after marking.

[17:05:39] <selwyn> on the one hand, the gov would seize upon it to get people to blame the striking lorry drivers for shortages
[17:05:48] <selwyn> on the other, very little ability for the gov to break the strike
[17:07:57] <selwyn> suspect the gov¬¥s instinct is to go full thatcher and try and crush dissent, but it might not work for that same reason
[17:08:14] <Gnuxie> yeah

[17:24:43] <selwyn> in britain, the precedent is the defeat of the miners in the 80s

[17:31:13] <selwyn> if they strike, then labour will probably oppose the strike
[17:31:31] <selwyn> which would make a strike victory funnier

[22:57:29] <lotuseater> and giving them better consistency :P
[23:01:24] <shka> sure, but i would rather focus on the data science domain
[23:01:40] <shka> python is fine for trivial stuff
[23:01:51] <shka> well, other then being unstable 
[23:06:53] <lotuseater> in 2018 i worked some time at a company which does data science with it, actually i like its science stack
[23:08:00] <lotuseater> i thought (and started a bit) about a pandas in cl called pancl (ok, naming is hard) and that could also profit heavily from April
[23:09:04] <shka> nah, i hate that stack
[23:09:07] <lotuseater> but ok, first better focus on a small subset of it, it's big
[23:09:09] <shka> and pandas in particular
[23:09:17] <lotuseater> haha so one reason more!
[23:09:35] <shka> i even made data frame library for cl
[23:10:29] <lotuseater> shka: the one thing my collegues didn't know from it was SymPy, they were all coming from physics but no one was into symbolic computing
[23:10:33] <lotuseater> ah nice
[23:10:57] <lotuseater> so we could look how to shorten certain things :P
[23:11:35] <lotuseater> but what I now saw this year as I was looking into pandas doc was inconsistency in even simple things
[23:11:47] <shka> my lib benefits from being cl-ds compatible 
[23:11:55] <shka> so i can write code like this https://gist.github.com/sirherrbatka/b49af905615a6bc8f96703985f92399a
