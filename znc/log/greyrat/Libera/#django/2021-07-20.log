[00:34:39] <Steve-Dusty> For Django full stack developers: How do you even write the CSS
[00:34:42] <Steve-Dusty> they're so annoying
[00:34:45] <Steve-Dusty> I want to kill myself
[00:34:54] <GinFuyou> Bootstrap + SASS
[00:36:07] <GinFuyou> Though I adopted bootstrap pretty late. Maybe they polished docs in later versions, for few years I felt that's I'm better off writing styles from ground up if it's not too fancy
[00:37:13] <Steve-Dusty> Holy
[00:37:16] <Steve-Dusty> they're such a bottleneck
[00:38:08] <Quacc> scss actually looks quite nice
[00:38:11] <GinFuyou> I relatively enjoyed writing sass
[00:38:12] <Quacc> might try to learn it
[00:38:23] <GinFuyou> Because it has syntax somewhat like python
[00:38:36] <Quacc> its always annoying that css is always so hardcoded
[00:40:10] <Steve-Dusty> sass political
[00:41:41] <nedbat> sass is great!
[00:41:55] <Steve-Dusty> I want to do tailwindCSS
[00:43:21] <Steve-Dusty> My problem is the CSS core concepts
[00:43:29] <Steve-Dusty> such as columns and flexboxes & shit
[00:44:37] <Quacc> im looking at it and it seems a little odd that you would flood your classnames instead of just adding a .css file

[05:07:30] <Steve-Dusty1> re run migrate
[05:07:34] <Steve-Dusty1> re run makemigrations
[05:07:37] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty1: err... why would you delete the migration files?
[05:07:39] <Steve-Dusty1> re run migrate again
[05:07:49] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob i drop the table from the sqlite
[05:07:54] <Steve-Dusty1> i read from a tutorial once and it worked
[05:07:59] <FunkyBob> rannnn8888: yes, I saw that
[05:08:13] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty1: then either the tutorial was wrong, or you misunderstood
[05:08:30] <FunkyBob> if they broke their db by side-stepping migrations, there's no reason to remove the migrations
[05:08:32] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob but now when i try make new python manage.py migrate news 0001 its stil want the table i drop
[05:08:45] <rannnn8888> and write me django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: news_newsstable
[05:08:50] <FunkyBob> rannnn8888: did you delete the DB file?
[05:09:00] <rannnn8888> no
[05:09:03] <FunkyBob> that's why
[05:09:17] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob what u mean the db file ?
[05:09:20] <FunkyBob> you changed the DB, and django doesn't know it's changed... beause it's not recorded in the migrations
[05:09:22] <rannnn8888> the sqlite.db ?
[05:09:27] <FunkyBob> rannnn8888: you're using sqlite, yes?
[05:09:28] <FunkyBob> yes
[05:09:30] <FunkyBob> that file
[05:10:01] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob yes so how i tell him i edit this file and make new makemigrations ?
[05:10:20] <FunkyBob> why did you manually alter your DB?
[05:10:40] <FunkyBob> the fix is either (a) manually recreate the table, or (b) destroy the DB and start again
[05:10:57] <Steve-Dusty1> if you're on windows and using an editor like VScode go to the left sidebar
[05:11:04] <FunkyBob> since all your migrations already exist, applying them to a clean DB will be simple and fast
[05:11:13] <Steve-Dusty1> and right click db.sqlite3
[05:11:16] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob I thought it was easier to remove manually so I checked: s
[05:11:23] <Steve-Dusty1> delete
[05:11:24] <Steve-Dusty1> ez
[05:12:13] <rannnn8888> sec So what is better to do right now delete this file sqlite ?
[05:12:23] <rannnn8888> its new project
[05:12:25] <FunkyBob> rannnn8888: why did you want to remove the table, anyway?
[05:12:27] <Steve-Dusty1> that's what he's saying
[05:12:46] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob i not need the table....
[05:12:58] <FunkyBob> so remove the model, and create a migration
[05:13:03] <FunkyBob> and django will drop the table for you
[05:13:10] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob i try
[05:13:24] <rannnn8888> python manage.py makemigrations news
[05:13:43] <FunkyBob> and?
[05:13:58] <FunkyBob> was that before or after you manually altered the DB?
[05:14:43] <rannnn8888> i said after i make this and make the python manage.py migrate news 0006
[05:14:58] <rannnn8888> it still give me the django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: news_newsstable
[05:15:00] <FunkyBob> pardon?
[05:15:05] <FunkyBob> after you make this what?
[05:15:26] <rannnn8888> it Still looking for the table
[05:15:29] <FunkyBob> so... you've broken your DB, and now are trying to do the right thing
[05:15:36] <rannnn8888> Although I deleted the model
[05:15:42] <FunkyBob> well
[05:15:48] <FunkyBob> it would help if you'd dpaste the traceback
[05:15:59] <FunkyBob> perhaps this is exposing another mistake -- of using the ORM on import
[05:16:04] <Steve-Dusty1> dpaste.org
[05:16:23] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob but its new prokect no more easy remove the file ?
[05:16:26] <rannnn8888> and make new one ?
[05:16:35] <FunkyBob> remove which file?
[05:16:42] <FunkyBob> i'm just trying to find out what you did and whatr you're doing
[05:16:48] <rannnn8888> db.sqlite3
[05:16:51] <FunkyBob> but getting a clear timeline from you is proving impossible
[05:16:51] *** Joins: bitdex (~bitdex@gateway/tor-sasl/bitdex)
[05:17:10] <FunkyBob> dpaste the traceback
[05:17:27] <FunkyBob> yes, delete the sqlite3 file and run makemigrations again... but first, show us the traceback
[05:17:35] <FunkyBob> as I said.. it may be a sign you've done something ELSE wrong
[05:17:55] <rannnn8888> https://dpaste.org/e21k
[05:18:38] <FunkyBob> ok, it's  failing exactly when trying to delete the table you already deleted
[05:18:43] <FunkyBob> is that the only outstanding migration?
[05:18:49] <FunkyBob> and is that the only action in the migratoin file?
[05:19:38] <FunkyBob> we might be able to salvage this
[05:19:40] <rannnn8888> YES
[05:19:44] <FunkyBob> yes what?
[05:19:52] <Steve-Dusty1> he got it to work
[05:19:52] <rannnn8888> is that the only outstanding migration?
[05:19:57] <Steve-Dusty1> nvm
[05:20:24] <FunkyBob> rannnn8888: ok, and is the drop table the only action in that migration?
[05:21:25] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob i think :x dont sure what u mean :D
[05:22:19] <FunkyBob> look inside the migration file
[05:24:04] <rannnn8888> FunkyBob i make new in table in the sqlite same name
[05:24:15] <rannnn8888> and make new makemigrations
[05:24:22] <FunkyBob> *sigh*
[05:24:25] <rannnn8888> its slove this
[05:25:00] <Steve-Dusty1> ...
[05:25:16] <Steve-Dusty1> why wont you let django make it for you
[05:25:17] <FunkyBob> if that was the only action, you could have applied the migration with a --fake flag
[05:25:29] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty1: because django did make it for them
[05:25:38] <FunkyBob> then they deleted it, then told django to delete it
[05:26:41] <Steve-Dusty1> bruh
[05:28:20] <FunkyBob> afk

[05:34:06] <Quacc> not really
[05:34:11] <Quacc> nobody knows everything
[05:35:17] <Steve-Dusty1> It has been brought to my attention that a friend of mine, we will call him "Krab Kid", is addicted to using rust! As a proud mother and user of the facebook app I have seen tons of warnings about this thing called rust! First of all, rust is known to be super unsafe. Nobody knows why the language is so unsafe but krab kid still loves it for some
[05:35:18] <Steve-Dusty1> reason. Secondly, rust is known to be slow. As an interpreted language it cant even do basic mathematical operations without a large delay. And finally, I have seen that rust has a huge lack of documentation! Nothing is documented and the language is SUPER hard to learn! If you are reading this please convince Krab Kid to stop using rust. From one
[05:35:18] <Steve-Dusty1> user of the facebook app to another.

[06:19:50] <FunkyBob> nope
[06:19:58] <FunkyBob> almost never use them anyway.
[06:20:17] <FunkyBob> if there's a 'right' place for them, the docs will say
[06:20:28] <dodobrain> well, i call them fixtures.. but they arent really just data being loaded using some management command
[06:20:29] <FunkyBob> if no, I guess a fixtures/ dir would be t idy
[06:20:41] <dodobrain> they objects are actually being created and then saved
[06:20:50] <dodobrain> yeah i was thinking myapp/fixtures
[06:20:58] <FunkyBob> how is that different to fixtures?
[06:21:42] <dodobrain> i thought fixtures were always (usually?) serialised representation of the objects

[06:40:42] <schinckel> dodobrain: Have you looked at factory-boy and similar tools? They might be way you can do that with less work.
[06:41:14] <schinckel> (ie, you define the factory once, and then you can call it with just the non-default arguments, and it will manage creating inter-related objects too)
[06:41:19] <dodobrain> sure, but allegedly the work has already been done
[06:41:42] <dodobrain> they had these needed-for-prod data generators sitting inside the tests dirs lol
[06:42:03] <schinckel> I've found that fixture-factories that are "naïve" tend to decay as the models change.
[06:42:08] <dodobrain> so i'm just moving them off to the right place since our deployments will completely get rid of the tests dir
[06:42:29] <schinckel> IMHO data generation for production belongs in migrations.
[06:44:07] <dodobrain> schinckel, what if the objects being created are in a different model in a different app ?
[06:44:19] <dodobrain> atleast thats what i see with one of the fixtures they want to have in prod
[06:44:22] <schinckel> Yeah, that's fine. You can reference other factories.

[06:45:53] <schinckel> The advantage of doing it in a RunPython migration is that the creation would use the model as it was when it was first written, and any subsequent model changes should migrate the data in the database.
[06:46:23] <schinckel> (I mean load, not import in RunPython. You shouldn't ever import models into a RunPython, only ever load them from the apps.get_model())

[09:15:43] <Steve-Dusty> FunkyBob is just telling me how learning html, css, js, and backend is tricky

[09:17:08] <FunkyBob> both have their learning curves
[09:17:25] <Quacc> yea but backend just made more sense to me

[09:19:13] <Steve-Dusty> couldn't install CSGO on Arch because of some Nvidia RTX problems that interacts with KDE

[09:20:18] <Steve-Dusty> anyways I'm trying to learn as fast as possible

[09:20:42] <FunkyBob> oh boy... it's going to be wallbroken all over again

[09:23:35] <FunkyBob> well
[09:23:37] <PaulWay[w]> Yes
[09:23:40] <FunkyBob> that's where things were inconsistent
[09:23:44] <PaulWay[w]> And didn't take our advice.
[09:24:01] <PaulWay[w]> And seemed at times to not understand Python - or indeed programming languages - at all.
[09:24:11] <Steve-Dusty> D:
[09:25:09] <PaulWay[w]> And blamed us when their own code went wrong.
[09:25:15] <FunkyBob> anyway

[09:28:00] <FunkyBob> possibly several times
[09:28:02] <PaulWay[w]> Yep.
[09:28:06] <FunkyBob> before it becomes presentable
[09:28:15] <PaulWay[w]> Have you heard of the X-Y problem?
[09:28:18] <Steve-Dusty> no
[09:28:46] <Steve-Dusty> but I can tell you that I'm not trying to do something for someone or for some project
[09:28:57] <PaulWay[w]> OK.  :-)
[09:29:26] <PaulWay[w]> The X-Y problem is: person doesn't know how to do X, but they think it involves doing Y, which they have problems.  So they ask how to solve problem Y when they really want to solve problem X.

[09:39:06] <PaulWay[w]> That's why I try to answer those questions with a 'what are you doing' type question.
[09:39:32] <FunkyBob> "Tell me the problem you want to solve, before the solution you're trying to fix."
[09:39:53] <PaulWay[w]> schinckel: I've got a poser for you.  Remember that way of getting the earliest date of a subexpression you helped me with before?
[09:40:12] <schinckel> Yeah, my suggestion was to order by date and then slice.

[09:40:59] <PaulWay[w]> Yep.  Now I have to find the first date that's *after* the latest date that this problem _wasn't_ reported.
[09:41:07] <PaulWay[w]> So that's complicated...
[09:42:12] <schinckel> So it's actual dates, not timestamps?
[09:44:29] <PaulWay[w]> Well, the upload's checked_on is a DateTimeField.
[09:45:20] <PaulWay[w]> But now I have to work out how to ask 'latest time since now that an upload did _not_ contain a report of this rule, or "start of history", whichever is later.'
[09:45:33] <PaulWay[w]> I'm playing with it at the moment.

[13:54:25] <jor> pytest monkeypatch does a workaround for you I believe
[13:54:48] <jor> grabbin' it from the __dict__ instead, to avoid the descriptor

[17:00:42] <wallbroken> Kim^J: manages the request of "orders" template
[17:01:21] <wallbroken> i'm not understanding how self.request.user.terminated_items.add(obj) could affect ordered_items and delivered_items m2m fields
[17:02:12] <Kim^J> Well, look in ShoeOrdersForm
[17:02:48] <wallbroken> Kim^J: can you give me some hint?
[17:03:25] <wallbroken> request.user.ordered_items.add(* request.user.cart_items.all())
[17:03:37] <wallbroken> this is the only line that affects ordered_items
[17:03:50] <wallbroken> and it is not in ShoeOrdersForm
[17:04:08] <wallbroken> so, no idea on why that view changes the state of the other m2m fields
[17:07:57] <Kim^J> Well, we won't either, because we can't see it.
[17:07:58] *** Joins: dez (uid92154@user/dez)
[17:08:24] <Kim^J> And still, why are you using m2m-relations?!
[17:08:34] <Kim^J> There's 0 reasons for it.
[17:13:44] <wallbroken> Kim^J: because GinFuyou long time ago told me to use that
[17:14:05] <wallbroken> but keep the point
[17:14:33] <wallbroken> the point is: why the state of all the m2m filds is lost when i submit the form?
[17:14:47] <wallbroken> this is the actual question
[17:14:55] <Kim^J> We don't know, becayse we don't know wtfs going on in the form!
[17:15:32] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/qEAW
[17:15:35] <wallbroken> this is the form
[17:20:25] <Kim^J> So, it
[17:20:45] <Kim^J> s likely that the form does automagic and nulls your fields, because you didn't present any values for them.
[17:20:55] <Kim^J> I'd override methods on the form.
[17:20:58] <Kim^J> And see what they do.
[17:22:13] <wallbroken> Kim^J: if i don't present values on submit, the past saved ones are lost?
[17:22:31] <Kim^J> I suspect that.
[17:22:48] <wallbroken> how can i do to avoid this?
[17:24:29] <Kim^J> Well, by designing correctly.
[17:24:35] <Kim^J> By not using m2m fields.
[17:27:06] <wallbroken> Kim^J: tell that to GinFuyou
[17:27:08] <wallbroken> not to me
[17:27:16] <Kim^J> You're the one writing the code.
[17:27:26] <Kim^J> And we've been telling you for weeks now that the design is shit.
[17:27:35] <wallbroken> but can you help me on the point?
[17:27:45] <wallbroken> is there a way to keep the state in the form?
[17:28:18] <Kim^J> Override methods on the form to figure out what they do and what fields they change.
[17:28:29] <Kim^J> Look into the source code for those classes.
[17:28:32] <Kim^J> Check the documentation.
[17:28:49] <Kim^J> There are likely methods that specifically deal with many to many relations.
[17:29:25] <wallbroken> override how?
[17:30:18] <Kim^J> Google it.
