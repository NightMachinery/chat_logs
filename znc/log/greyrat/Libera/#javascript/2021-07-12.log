[00:39:38] <kinabalu> nedbat: in JavaScript it's common to have objects where you're unsure if the object you're looking at contains what you want, so using accessor will throw an error which generally you want to avoid.

[00:52:18] <systemfault> wroathe: I, of course, looked at the Transform stream but it doesn't do batch operations, the "transform" function is still called for every element
[00:52:55] <GreenJello> so make the element be an array?

[00:53:16] <wroathe> Yeah, the batch itself would be the fundamental streaming unit
[00:53:59] <systemfault> I don't have "access" to those batches, that's the root of the problem
[00:55:04] <systemfault> I may be missing something fundamental here..

[00:56:41] <systemfault> wroathe: I'll try to be more concrete, I have to load a set of 5k json string off the Database using a stream
[00:57:19] <systemfault> And now, I was profiling and saw that JSON.parse calls were fairy expensive here... so I thought I could just reduce the number of calls
[00:57:48] <systemfault> JSON.parse(`[${batch.join(',')}]`)
[00:58:07] <systemfault> It's indeed fairly faster...
[00:58:25] <systemfault> So now, I was just trying to apply that to my "sql stream
[00:58:26] <systemfault> "
[01:00:24] <wroathe> systemfault: It sounds like you're primarily looking to use streams for their buffering capacity. I don't remember the details of the API to do that, but IIRC it had to do with establishing a high water mark, and then listening for some kind of event on the writable stream to determine when it's appropriate to process the objects within
[01:01:00] <wroathe> i.e. read until it hits some threshold amount, then concat the JSON strings together and parse them, and emit a parsed object
[01:01:27] <wroathe> systemfault: The terminology the documentation uses for that is "high water mark"
[01:01:51] <systemfault> I'll look more into that

[05:30:56] <entuland> zebra in particular has a developer portal you could try asking to
[05:31:17] <crazyhorse> So typically
[05:32:13] <crazyhorse> with the ethernet thermal printers I've worked with.. you create a canvas element.. you then convert the pixels in the canvas element to a string in a particular format and then you send that to the printers https server
[05:33:05] <crazyhorse> Zebra's not really the manufacturer i'd want to use (expensive), so i'm trying to work out if there's some sort of standard with bluetooth printing
[05:33:29] <crazyhorse> or if every manufacturer has got some underlying custom api
[05:33:48] <crazyhorse> well more like "data format"
[05:34:00] <entuland> I'll be honest, for printers in particular I'm not sure I really see the need for this, as you should be able to print to any correctly installed device... what's the scenario that needs for such a web api that couldn't be already achieved simply printing from the browser?
[05:39:50] <crazyhorse> this is for thermal receipt and label priting
[05:39:52] <crazyhorse> printing
[05:40:05] <crazyhorse> normally you have to do it via https or bluetooth directly
[05:40:16] <crazyhorse> browser print is more for printing web pages

[07:33:14] <jellobot> ashnur, Modules divide programs into clusters of code that, by some criterion, belong together. \"!es6 modules\" are second-class, but JS can encode first-class ones. Major implementations include CommonJS, Node modules (a variant of CJS), and AMD. All of them can be used in any JS VM, including browsers.

[15:52:24] <hassoon> start over but slowly
[15:54:44] <hmw[at]> Is remote debugging of browsers no longer available? I can't get a remote inspector/dev console with FF nor Chromium
[15:55:01] <gehn> hmw[at], remote in what sense?
[15:55:05] <hmw[at]> networked
[15:55:17] <hmw[at]> I did it 2 years ago and it was rather simple
[15:55:35] <hmw[at]> Now I only find instructions that don't do as advertised or are for remote debugging android devices
[15:55:46] <hmw[at]> (over USB btw)
[15:56:27] <gehn> "networked" doesn't add any more clarification than the word "remote"
[15:56:43] <gehn> what are you actually trying to do and why?
[15:56:45] <hmw[at]> 2 computers, one running JS, the other connecting to the browser and displaying the dev tools
[15:56:58] *** Joins: Crassus (~Crassus@user/crassus)
[15:57:08] <gehn> running JS where? in node? in a browse? connecting to "the browser"? which browser? running where?
[15:57:20] <hmw[at]> Browser. Normal remote debugging.
[15:57:26] <gehn> that tells us nothing
[15:57:35] <gehn> "browser" is not a sufficient answer
[15:57:36] <hmw[at]> 2 computers with browsers, one running JS, the other connecting to the browser and displaying the dev tools
[15:57:43] <gehn> nor is that as many answers as questions I asked
[15:57:50] <gehn> repeating yourself doesn't make it any easier to understand you
[15:57:59] <hmw[at]> How can I clarify it
[15:58:09] <gehn> learn to communicate better?
[15:58:12] <hmw[at]> I want the dev tools, but over network on the other machine
[15:58:25] <gehn> I dunno, providing detailed specifications and requirements is part of a programmer's job description
[15:58:39] <hmw[at]> I am not unclear, I think
[15:58:56] <gehn> you don't really get to choose
[15:59:30] <hmw[at]> What puzzles me a lot is that I can't find instructions, or the instructions that I find don't do as advertised. It used to be super simple.
[15:59:59] <hmw[at]> starting the browser with a command line param to enable the remote thing, and use the other browser to connect to it.
[16:00:45] <hmw[at]> chromium --remote-debugging-port 1234 ---> it opens http://0.0.31.64/ and no connection from outside is possible
[16:01:03] <hmw[at]> similar with FF
[16:01:11] <gehn> ok now that's better and more specific
[16:01:40] <gehn> I still don't know, but now we might have sufficient clarity for someone else to help
[16:02:00] <hmw[at]> the question is "Has remote debugging be removed from the browsers"

[16:03:09] <hmw[at]> Or. Why is all remote debugging suddenly about Android https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/
[16:03:26] <gehn> I don't think it's "suddenly" like that
[16:03:42] <hmw[at]> It used to be easy to find and execute 2 years ago. Now I can't find info on how to do it
[16:03:43] <gehn> there are only two main things I know of that resemble what I think you're talking about
[16:03:55] <gehn> mobile device devtools, and node-inspector
[16:04:30] <hmw[at]> There used to be some normal debugging possible over a network connection, just as if you would press F12 but only networked
[16:04:45] <gehn> usually using a mobile device with devtools requires a direct physical tether of your phone (i.e. it must be plugged in via USB or whatever)
[16:04:58] <hmw[at]> it is a RasPi and I can't see things on that tiny display, so I need the remote dev console
[16:05:16] <hmw[at]> it is a PC (RasPi with linux) not a mobile

[16:14:50] <hmw[at]> connecting from the same machine makes no sense (I could just press F12) and the other machine says "Connection failed" at https://harald.ist.org/paste/images/2021-07-12_13-44-35.png
[16:15:33] <Alexendoo> You're connecting to chrome with firefox?
[16:15:56] <hmw[at]> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/about:debugging#connecting_over_the_network
[16:16:09] <hmw[at]> I am trying all possible combinations. Have been trying for 3 hours now.
[16:17:11] <gehn> hmw[at], it makes sense
[16:17:13] <hmw[at]> Also for Chrome, I can't find instructions, so I have to guess a few things
[16:17:27] <gehn> hmw[at], this is the facility I was talking about earlier in regards to debugging node using chrome devtools
[16:17:29] <gehn> node is not chrome
[16:17:40] <hmw[at]> I am not using node at all here
[16:17:44] <gehn> yet they can run on the same machine
[16:17:49] <gehn> I didn't say you were
[16:17:54] <gehn> I'm telling you what is going on
[16:18:13] <gehn> so yes "remote" can mean node is connecting to chrome devtools from the same local machine
[16:18:25] <gehn> and in this context, that's probably what it really means and is really intended for
[16:18:30] <gehn> not browser-to-browser
[16:18:30] <hmw[at]> wait. you mean, that menu I showed in the screenshot/link to mozilla.org are instructions to connect to a node server?
[16:18:56] <hmw[at]> Where did the browser-to-browser remote dev thing go?
[16:19:08] <gehn> I don't think it was ever a thing, I think you may be misremembering
[16:19:18] <hmw[at]> I am 100% positive about it
[16:19:30] <gehn> a great many people are 100% positive about a great many foolish ideas
[16:19:47] <hmw[at]> it was like detaching the dev tools more or less, only with a network stuffed inbetween
[16:19:59] <hmw[at]> I am not new to this either.

[16:20:32] <gehn> I'm not 100% positive you're wrong
[16:20:43] <gehn> but I strongly suspect you're mistaken or misattributing some past memory
[16:20:58] <hmw[at]> sorry if I am a bit unpleasant today. You can imagine how one struggles after 3 hours of making no progress
[16:21:09] <gehn> anyway, for your use case, which is what matters... XDMCP is what I would try
[16:21:26] <gehn> it seems like the "right tool for the job" to me
[16:21:30] *** Joins: wyclif (~wyclif@user/wyclif)
[16:21:53] <gehn> or I dunno, another option might be just hook an external monitor to the pi so the screen is bigger?
[16:22:10] <gehn> then all of this browser-to-browser debugging business goes away
[16:22:13] <hmw[at]> then it would lose the touch screen function :/ meh yeah, I can do that
[16:22:28] <hmw[at]> i can use a magnifying glass too
[16:22:48] <hmw[at]> wtf why have computers become so unstable
[16:22:57] <hmw[at]> I demand a time machine
[16:23:20] <hmw[at]> iirc, only FF had that remote console I am talking about, btw
[16:23:20] <gehn> I don't think computers were ever particularly stable in the first place
[16:23:37] <hmw[at]> my C64 is claiming the opposite. It still works as I have learned it
[16:23:55] <hmw[at]> In my experience, PCs with Linux were the finest around 2005-2010
[16:23:57] <gehn> still works doesn't mean stable
[16:24:05] <gehn> you can still write buggy BASIC
[16:24:12] <hmw[at]> stable = APIs not changing every other week
[16:24:37] <gehn> every other week seems a bit of an overstatement
[16:24:47] <gehn> JS is still backwards compatible to like 1995 or something
[16:24:47] <hmw[at]> even my makefiles for simple C programs stop working after 2 years or so
[16:25:01] <gehn> not if you stay on the same versions of gcc/make
[16:25:17] <hmw[at]> yeah. I am considering never updating my boxes again :)
[16:25:20] <gehn> and yes, major version changes break things, that's how we make progress in the world
[16:25:28] <hmw[at]> (not quite ironic even. I dream of it being a thing)
[16:25:44] <gehn> ideally minor version changes are never breaking, but you know that's up to the devs and each dev is different
[16:26:14] <hmw[at]> It's the internet and the threats that come with it. Since we "need" security updates, stability has been going down

[16:27:13] <hmw[at]> What else than what I think of could the option "Enable remote debugging" possibly mean in my FF?
[16:27:29] <gehn> it could mean what I just explained earlier about node
[16:27:37] <hmw[at]> ah as a client
[16:27:40] <hmw[at]> that'd be weird tho
[16:27:48] <hmw[at]> why would the browser have that built in
[16:27:56] <gehn> what other graphical debugging facilities do you know of for node?
[16:28:13] <gehn> it's been a thing for at least >5 years so I don't know about weird
[16:28:19] <gehn> you may have been unaware of it is all
[16:28:43] <hmw[at]> I am not used to work in node. I only ever wrote one serious program with it. So yeah, I am not up to date with it

[16:29:44] <hmw[at]> and the whole world is now seemingly only interested in doing this over USB for an Android
[16:29:46] <gehn> it might also be for remote control of the debugger, rather than the other way around
[16:30:01] <gehn> i.e. so that programs like VSCode can "seamlessly" integrate as your debugger instead
[16:30:05] <gehn> not sure on that, just a guess
[16:30:28] <hmw[at]> I have the impression that the build in client was removed and indeed it only provides an API now for external debuggers.

"isometric" is too abused to feel like a good word for it, and "progressive" would be confusing with PWA, which are related but not the same thing per se) is that any state changes that *could* go through routing *should* go through routing, so that you can have any clicks et al gracefully fall back to a URL

[20:05:16] <jaawerth> and strictly speaking isomorphic should hew as close to working the same on front- and backend as possible, wheras the react SSR tends to be more of a range of graceful fallbacks in practice (it's not impossible, but it takes a lot of discipline to get 100% correct behavior even with javascript disabled with the hybrid approach)

[20:48:46] <xochilpili> wroathe, what you mean?
[20:48:51] <wroathe> xochilpili: Yeah, beforeEach will execute before you set kafkaConsumerRun
[20:49:11] <xochilpili> wroathe, oh shut, yeah!
[20:49:37] <xochilpili> duuuh, that's replacing my mock D:
[20:50:04] <wroathe> xochilpili: What I meant by "all over the place" is that you seem to be testing the implementation, and not the interface
[20:50:09] <wroathe> xochilpili: Which is a bad habit to get into
[20:50:18] <wroathe> One one of the drawbacks to mocks generally
[20:50:38] <xochilpili> what do you think would be a better way to test it ?
[20:51:03] <wroathe> xochilpili: That would require me to know a lot more about your application and how you're using Kafka, and I don't have that kind of time right now
[20:51:18] <xochilpili> wroathe, understood, thanks a lot
[20:51:28] <wroathe> xochilpili: Here's an article I like to recommend to new testers: v

[20:51:46] <wroathe> xochilpili: It's old, but the words within are sage advice

[21:35:07] <DPA> I don't think so. Stuff above the host, yes, but not below and including the host. I mean, I could style x-y using :host(selector) { prop: value; }, so surely somehow that should be possible for .a too?

[22:19:47] <Croves> Anyone experienced with Websockets? Why the send() in line 17 not working? https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/RXycp8f7fR/
[22:20:06] <Croves> I tested the Websocket with Postman and it works fine, now I'm building an interface for it using VueJS
[22:21:36] <stenno> define 'not working'
[22:22:12] <stenno> or specify, ratyher
[22:22:14] <stenno> -y
[22:22:39] <realies> is there a bug in RecordRTC.invokeSaveAsDialog? when I put a few dots in the filename it takes the word after the first one as the extension and it strips out all the rest
[22:22:51] <Croves> stenno The `fetchConnections` of my Websocket should return all active connections. In this case, I'm getting no response from server
[22:23:04] <realies> so test.test.test.webm downloads as test.test
[22:23:36] <GreenJello> realies, check the spec?
[22:23:50] <realies> lol, thought that was a js API
[22:24:29] <GreenJello> it's fine to ask, but probably too niche for someone to know off hand what the spec requires
