[17:02:44] <MatthiasVance> Does anyone have anything for reading streams backwards? :D
[17:15:32] <biberu> MatthiasVance: backwards?
[17:15:52] <MatthiasVance> The most significant information of this file format is at the end of the file :')
[17:16:11] <MatthiasVance> So I kind of have to parse backwards
[17:16:23] <MatthiasVance> Until I have everything I need and then go to some offset and start parsing from there
[17:16:58] <biberu> can you e.g. read to the end of file while buffering the number of lines(?) you need to backtrack?
[17:17:25] <MatthiasVance> I could technically buffer everything, but that would also be a performance hit
[17:17:32] <MatthiasVance> since the rest is on-demand (is my current thinking)
[17:18:24] <MatthiasVance> And the rest of the file is not necessarily line based
[17:19:02] <biberu> how is the file structured? suppose you had two pointers into it, one seeking ahead and one trailing, when would you know how if you could move the trailing one?
[17:19:17] <MatthiasVance> It's the PDF format
[17:19:33] <biberu> never had to parse that manually, sorry
[17:19:43] <MatthiasVance> I don't think a lot of people have :D
[17:19:47] <MatthiasVance> And they say: Any conforming reader shall read from the end of the file
[17:20:08] <MatthiasVance> so you have some EOF, then a keyword a bit back and inbetween a line that contains an offset of type int
[17:20:48] <MatthiasVance> But if I use a StreamReader and just walk backwards byte by byte performance should be fine
[17:20:53] <biberu> huh, ok, well I guess you could just start at the end and read blocks backwards until you find the marker?
[17:21:32] <MatthiasVance> yeah I think I'll do that and not use stream but something buffered
[17:21:51] <MatthiasVance> I wonder how the buffer in StreamReader works when you are working with the end of the file, or when you seek there
[17:21:51] <MatthiasVance> :D
