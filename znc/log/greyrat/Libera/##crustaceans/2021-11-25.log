[00:00:09] <ngoldbaum> it seems to have introduced a lot of people to the concept of the poynting vector
[00:02:28] <riv> absolutely yes
[00:02:39] <riv> it was all a set up for the trick question answer to be surprising
[00:02:55] <edk> yeah
[00:03:20] <edk> it presents what's basically reasonably intuitive in such a way as to make it seem unintuitive. that fucks me off; it's the opposite of what science communicators should do
[00:03:29] <riv> yeah exactly
[00:03:44] <riv> i knew - because veritasium is usually good - that he was saying something related to something true
[00:03:52] <riv> but i couldn't make sense of it til the eev blog video
[00:03:57] <edk> the "misconception" explanation at the beginning isn't nearly as wrong as he claims. it's incomplete, sure, but it's still useful, and the two problems with it that he gives are completely bogus
[00:04:47] <riv> i want to learn this electronics stuff way better
[00:09:56] <ngoldbaum> electrodynamics is hard! very nontrivial to calculate the time dependent fields and currents for that problem, most of the time for those kinds of circuit analysis things you only care about the steady state behavior where the intuition that the power is transmitted by the current is fine
[00:15:32] <edk> transmission line also operates on current in wires
[00:17:33] <edk> not exclusively, sure, but i think inductance and capacitance are still pretty intuitive
[00:18:19] <riv> i think I will start studying electronics on the weekends
[00:21:44] <edk> the unexpected thing that electronics people do often care about in practice is that the change in voltage along such a long wire will propagate as a wavefront
[00:21:58] <edk> but... the change in force along a chain in a pipe will also propagate as a wavefront
[00:22:17] <riv> that's interesting, the fourier series of a square wave was
[00:22:18] <riv> mentioned
[00:22:47] <riv> which I guess lets you analyze the pulse in terms of frequencies
[00:23:57] <edk> right, the components of the wave won't all be transmitted equally well

[17:08:50] <gwozniak> And if the web is more Unix-y with respect to apps, then it's good evidence to show that the Unix way is not a great way to make apps

[17:13:27] <gerikson> edk: don't you think that A/B testing and checking what hardware the end users have take care of that? I reject the idea of the ivory tower dev sitting with a brand new mac and thinking this is normal for everyonw
[17:13:32] <edk> i don't think the state of the world is generally strong evidence that any individual thing in it (like the state of the web) is good or bad. there are too many other forces that affect everything
[17:13:42] <gerikson> I'm sure there are people like that but do they push the needle?
[17:13:49] <gerikson> edk: agreed
[17:14:15] <edk> i don't think i've ever seen A/B testing used to benefit users though i'm sure it must happen somewhere
[17:16:09] <edk> checking what hardware the users have i'm also sure must happen but i doubt very much if it's the developers working on it; there'll be a UX team that does that sort of thing and they'll be just one of many competing pressures on engineering
[17:16:42] <edk> and again in my definitely not universal experience the pressure on engineering that always wins is feature requests
[17:16:46] <gwozniak> In my experience, it was based on whatever the boss was using
[17:27:16] <gerikson> ok
[17:27:28] <gerikson> do you think facebook and google care?

[17:30:31] <gwozniak> When I get upset about web performance I ask myself if I think web devs using slower machines would matter.  The answer is always "no"
[17:30:44] <gwozniak> Maybe it would.  But I doubt it
[17:46:27] <dimadima> i used a 2012 MBA until last year
[17:46:33] <dimadima> it was pretty brutal by the end

[17:51:50] <dimadima> not sure what that point of saying all the was
[17:52:15] <dimadima> except i think that my impression was that you either have an slow computer cause you're principled or low on cash
[17:52:20] <dimadima> i was some of both
[17:52:35] <dimadima> i don't imagine having a slow computer produces better software
[17:52:48] <dimadima> having a small phone i think does produce apps/sites that work better on small phones

[18:27:40] <gerikson> "phones aren't for 'real work'"
[18:35:12] <gwozniak> I wouldn't write code on them, but people get all kinds of work done on mobile devices
[18:36:09] <gwozniak> So, that person's statement is just demonstrably false
[18:48:59] <Xe> tell that to the kids that write literal essays on their phones
[18:50:42] <edk> gerikson: i think facebook and google are institutionally incapable of caring about anything; any large organisation is
[18:51:32] <Xe> edk: if your goal is to gaslight people, A/B testing is a fantastic way to do that
[18:51:37] <edk> their way of optimising for slow devices is often to add more stuff on top (e.g. showing boxes that look a tiny bit like text while the real text loads)
[18:52:21] <skyl4rk> and then is deleted "no posts found"
[18:52:27] <edk> i think their A/B tests are probably scored by things like clicks and time on site
[18:54:12] <edk> so like... yet another change to youtube to make the "autoplay enabled" indicator harder to notice probably does better than making it leaner and faster to load
[18:54:17] <edk> and it's also much easier
[19:03:35] <edm> "If somebody is curious about my Fish configuration, you can find it here." if english had a proper type system this wouldn't compile
[19:05:16] <edk> more people have complained about semantically invalid sentences than i have
[19:16:57] <Xe> edm: the good news is that there is no formal regulatory body on what is and is not "correct" english
[19:17:25] <edm> but it leads to loads of undefined behaviour
[19:17:25] <Xe> so realistically English has the same type safety as PHP or JavaScript
[19:20:57] <Brekkjern> Everything about English is undefined behaviour.
[19:21:40] <edm> that's a load of Coq

[19:29:38] <edk> i'm sure you could formally specify a natural language if you had enough formalisms, but yes it would need to admit inconsistent statements
[19:31:02] <edk> it's enough to get inconsistency out of english that you can describe the concept of english sentences
[19:31:21] <edk> and a language that wasn't capable of that sort of self-reference wouldn't be much use
