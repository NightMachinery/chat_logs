[04:09:12] <TheWild> I'm not about practical crypto right now rather than about puzzle made for myself.
[04:09:12] <TheWild> RSA cryptosystem. Alice generates A_n, A_d and A_e and publishes (A_n, A_e). Bob generates B_n, B_d, B_e and publishes (B_n, B_e).
[04:09:12] <TheWild> Alice sends a message to Bob by encrypting it using Bob's public key. How Bob would know that the message came in fact from Alice? Is this possible to verify the identity without involvement of hashing algorithms and DSA?

[21:32:43] <onelegend> wonder if it should be possible that a website is signed by multiple independent certificate authorities
[21:38:43] *** Joins: kish` (~aqua@user/aqua)
[21:39:37] <Alipha> onelegend: certificates can be cross-signed
[21:40:46] <Alipha> Notably, let's encrypt certs were cross-signed by some other certificate authority because let's encrypt was not yet recognized by all browsers as a CA
[21:40:56] <onelegend> wow
[21:41:20] <onelegend> imagine not recognizing Let's Encrypt
[21:41:33] <Alipha> There's actually still old devices which will never get an update to add let's encrypt to their OS's root store
[21:41:37] <onelegend> ah
[21:41:48] <onelegend> how do root certs get updated?
[21:42:02] <Alipha> OS updates.
[21:42:07] <Alipha> Or manually
[21:42:38] <onelegend> If I bought a laptop from eBay , this could be an issue
[21:43:06] <onelegend> person just modifies the certs
[21:43:21] <Peng> They could modify anything else too
[21:43:43] <Alipha> onelegend: strongly recommended to reinstall everything, including the OS, if you get a computer from someone else
[21:43:46] <int-e> you'd wipe the OS and install from scratch, of course... and hope the lower levels (BIOS and firmware) have not been tampered with
[21:44:48] <Alipha> Though also note firefox comes with its own root CA list, and I believe Chrome has started to bundle its own CA list too, so for those two browsers anyway, as long as you keep them up to date, their CA lists will stay up to date
[21:47:03] <Alipha> If the copy of windows was intended to be given to you, remember to extract the product key before wiping :-)
[21:47:33] <ericonr> Or trust big brother MS to remember your HW identifiers :p
[21:47:55] * ericonr has never had to recover a product key on modern windows when reinstalling
[21:48:34] <Alipha> ericonr: a reinstall, or a wipe and install fresh? Because I imagine those may be different
[21:48:52] <ericonr> Wipe and install fresh also works 
[21:49:17] <ericonr> I moved my mom's laptop to an SSD yesterday, it just werked
[21:49:30] <Alipha> Also, doesn't windows nowadays link your computer to a Live account?
[21:49:36] <ericonr> (and I didn't even login during the initial setup)
[21:49:49] <Alipha> Interesting
[21:50:04] <onelegend> SSDs are essential for OS's these days
[21:50:04] <ericonr> It wants to, but it will allow you not to login if you don't have an internet connection during initial setup
[21:50:30] <ericonr> My old laptop works just fine with HDD 
[21:50:38] <ericonr> But it's running Linux, not windows 
[21:50:39] <onelegend> I guess it depends
[21:50:42] <onelegend> ah I see
[21:51:33] <onelegend> I use an SSD on my linux server, because I use it to run VMs for fun

[21:52:32] <ericonr> Also my actual main laptop has an ssd
[21:52:49] <Alipha> I've been meaning to partition my computer and install windows 10 onto it, which currently has Linux. Originally, the computer had windows 8 (which then upgraded to windows 10), but the hard drive crashed years ago and I replaced it with an SSD. so I wonder if I'll have any problems getting it to validate (I extracted the product key from the old drive)

[23:24:48] <yawkat> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_problem
[23:25:58] <nisstyre> aac: every number has a unique prime factorization, so if you find two prime numbers whose product = the number, there cannot be more
[23:26:09] <wasamasa> there are RSA keys using three factors
[23:26:45] <aac> yes..but how can i assure that the number has only two factors?
[23:26:52] <nisstyre> if you find two factors there cannot be more
[23:26:54] <aac> like a number can have multiple factors
[23:26:56] <wasamasa> take two primes and multiply them, lol
[23:27:39] <aac> why can't there cannot be more?
[23:27:49] <aac> like for example 12 = 1*3*2*2
[23:27:53] <aac> three factors
[23:27:54] <Alipha> aac: if there's more than two factors, then the math doesn't work. The RSA algorithm depends upon the value of Euler's totient function, which will end up being not what the algorithm requires if there's more than 2 primes
[23:28:05] <aac> ah i see
[23:28:06] <nisstyre> aac: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic
[23:28:40] <aac> ok thks! :)
[23:29:21] <Alipha> aac: specifically, step 3 of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#Key_generation depends upon p and q being prime

[23:30:45] <Alipha> aac: if you use non-prime numbers and you're able to calculate the totient function for them, then the algorithm might still work, but i'm not sure
