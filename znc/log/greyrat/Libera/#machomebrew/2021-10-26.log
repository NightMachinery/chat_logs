[21:17:28] <rawtaz> hi!
[21:18:00] <rawtaz> does anyone know why on earth ansible requires rust? i have this when running `brew upgrade`:
[21:18:04] <rawtaz> ==> Installing dependencies for ansible: rust, python@3.10 and six
[21:18:04] <rawtaz> ==> Installing ansible dependency: rust
[21:28:12] <rawtaz> im not finding anything about rust in the ansible documentation
