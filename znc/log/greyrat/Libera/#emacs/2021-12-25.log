[00:05:31] <JordiGH> Huh, wtf, I just pasted some text from some wbsite and that made my buffer's font bigger.
[00:05:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> bremner: ediff-directories is just wonderful for managing the porting of infrastructure over moving codebases across different git repositories.

[00:06:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's pretty much the best Git frontend around.
[00:06:04] <tusko> I might try magit next
[00:06:29] <tusko> Does magit interact with hosting sites like github at all?
[00:06:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Magit is one of those Emacs packages that pretty much stands up on its own even before considering the rest of Emacs' functionality.
[00:06:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> tusko: There are extensions for that.
[00:06:44] <bremner> JordiGH: Do you have a link to the site? I'm curious how that is possible
[00:06:50] <tusko> Like what if I want to push a repo quickly to github
[00:06:53] <jeetelongname> xaltisc: I am not sure there may be but marginalia (and that entire stack) is pretty nice

[00:09:13] <fsbot`> Emacs extensions written in Emacs Lisp are called "packages", extensions written in C are called "modules", and there is no such thing as a "plugin".

[00:09:30] <fsbot`> If language is not correct, then what is said is not what is meant; if what is said is not what is meant, then what must be done remains undone; if this remains undone, morals and art will deteriorate; if justice goes astray, the people will stand about in helpless confusion. Hence there must be no arbitrariness in what is said. This matters above everything.

[08:14:37] <Spawns_Carpeting> basically if flycheck can run and parse "cargo test", or unit tests in general for other langs
[08:14:59] <johnjaye> in emacs there are usually hooks that are automatically run you modify

[21:37:11] <tyson2> chrisb: not sure, I just use the Music section on the programmes website
[21:37:46] <tyson2> It's the Radio 6 show (3 hours).  She also has a blues show on Radio 2
[21:38:50] <tyson2> I find that she has much better taste than average
[21:39:31] <tyson2> The blues show is good but only one hour per episode
[21:40:17] <chrisb> the BBC 6 show describes itself as music, poetry and guests
[21:40:33] <chrisb> so i will give that a try
[21:40:42] <tyson2> that's right, it's not continuous music.  I'm not coding at the moment so that doesn't matter much.

[22:07:12] <emacs_guy> im greatly customizing emacs and ive even learned some elisp in the mean time (beginner "programmer" i havent coded much just web development lol) but its been 6 months and its starting to get tiring (close to bankruptcy), its been 6 months and i still havent played around with proper project/workspace/tab support lol. i sometimes feel like barebones-emacs/emacs isnt worth it long term if it takes this much time to make it work the wa
[22:07:12] <emacs_guy> i want, im very unsure. i feel like grabbing more integrated libraries now but im not sure if its worth it compared to native functionality...

[22:08:30] <emacs_guy> so uh... in this case... would project.el and native tabs be a better idea than playing around with whats offered 3rd party ?

[22:09:02] <emacs_guy> workgroups seems to be the best workspace/persistence layer but i havent really gotten it to work and it isnt as nearly integrated as projectile

[22:12:19] <johnjaye> idk what you want
[22:12:25] <emacs_guy> me neither i need pointers
[22:12:28] <johnjaye> emacs isn't an ide so the project support is very limited.
[22:12:33] <johnjaye> projectile as you said
[22:13:03] <emacs_guy> can it be a very good ide if i remain faithful to it?!
[22:13:09] <emacs_guy> for ... nearly... everything i guess
[22:13:11] <johnjaye> if you're talking about saving and loading windows and projects that's a good thing
[22:13:23] <johnjaye> it would be an interesting thing to work on if projectile doesn't do it
[22:13:47] <johnjaye> well it does similar thing to vs code
[22:14:01] <johnjaye> syntax highlighting and completion/text editing/basic ide stuff
[22:14:14] <johnjaye> if you want an ide for the language you use best to just use one like pycharm
[22:15:26] <emacs_guy> but that would ruin the point for me.........
