[00:00:08] <lmat> entuland: Did you see https://jsfiddle.net/n9pmyrad/4/ ?
[00:00:21] <entuland> yes, but that's imposed size
[00:00:47] <lmat> entuland: Yes, I agree: div1 imposes its size on its parent, div2 entirely submits to the parent and grows (or shrinks?) to match the parent and therefore div1.
[00:00:49] <entuland> and that's overly complex for the simple requirements you have
[00:02:23] <lmat> entuland: Agreed, but it's the only way I've seen to get it to work :-D
[00:03:20] <lmat> entuland: On the other hand, the javascript way may not be terrible. When div2 is going to be shown, set its size to div1's size :shrug:
[00:04:14] <entuland> there are countless ways to do that, the simpler you get, the better: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/dr1k9mLw/
[00:04:54] <entuland> using visibility vs using a background on .small is a minor detail and you're free to do that in whatever way you like better
[00:05:06] <entuland> same with all the rest - just don't mix up techniques that aren't necessary
[00:07:13] <DPA> With flex, all children can be made to have the same height based on which one needs the most height.
[00:07:13] <DPA> I added a transition to my example: https://jsfiddle.net/amxw5op6/
[00:07:37] <entuland> how you toggle the state is not important here - could be via JS using classes or altering styles or could be with checkboxes as DPA did earlier or any other technique
[00:08:01] <hassoon> entuland: normally if div1 and div2 are sibling flex items, the empty div2 will follow div1 in height https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/371
[00:08:13] <hassoon> doesn't that validate what you want lmat ?
[00:08:55] <entuland> I'm not seeing their requirement of hiding one and showing the other in that last fiddle
[00:10:09] <hassoon> ah i c
[00:10:17] <hassoon> DPA's fiddle seems fine
[00:10:50] <entuland> yep it really boils down to what lmat wants to use, anything that works will work :P
[00:11:29] <hassoon> using checkboxes as toggling controls is nice
[00:11:48] <entuland> it has the downside that requires additional dedicated markup
[00:12:26] <entuland> but may be worth it if avoiding JS is a requirement or a desired feature
[00:12:37] <DPA> I really like doing that. I've once coded an entire game that way in pure CSS: https://dpa.li/tic-tac-toe.html
[00:14:17] <DPA> :checked is the best thing ever!
[00:14:46] <entuland> lovable technique but I'd be pulling my hair trying to implement such trickeries :P
[00:14:50] <entuland> I admire your patience ahahah
[00:15:12] <undeclared> haha yeah
[00:15:13] <undeclared> nicely done
[00:15:16] <hassoon> DPA: nice
[00:15:18] <entuland> seen complex mazes and plenty of other weird games implemented with pure CSS
[00:15:29] <DPA> Thanks
[00:19:47] <hassoon> the cpu-filled cases are not automated at all, seems like a simple algorithm made up with CSS selectors
[00:19:56] <hassoon> same cases for same user-selected spots
[00:21:55] <DPA> Yes. I manually wrote out all possible games, and the perfect next move, then checked all prior moves that could have lead to the board state with a small script, and put that into a css selector.
[00:22:24] <DPA> There is one row of checkboxes for each field in each round.
[00:22:46] <hassoon> ya ight exmplain the big number of checkboxes
[00:22:49] <hassoon> ya might
[00:22:51] <hassoon> *
[00:23:42] <hassoon> DPA: my game is totally randomized :p https://ghanhass.github.io/simon-game/
[00:25:04] <lmat> entuland: entuland: Your example (dr1k9mLw) looks great!! "how you toggle the state is not important here" yes, exactly.
[00:25:10] <lmat> DPA: That's a pretty transition :-D
[00:25:45] <DPA> hassoon: Nice
[00:27:14] <lmat> DPA: No js in there!? Wow.
[00:27:28] <hassoon> ya funny that game ahah
[00:29:32] <DPA> It does seam to have some JS, though: https://ghanhass.github.io/simon-game/main.js
[00:30:15] <hassoon>  DPA: ah yes sure, it's js-based, js is the biggest part there
[00:30:45] <lmat> hassoon: Strange notes you chose there! sol, do, fa, sol. I guess it's normally do, mi, sol, do, or maybe sol, do, mi, sol...
[00:31:47] <hassoon> DPA: the main css file is filled too :p
[00:32:11] <hassoon> lmat: nah i googled for the famous simon-game's sounds , and found those for each color
[00:34:33] <hassoon> i'm still thinking of that checkboxes gme lmao it's a funny idea
[00:34:33] <lmat> hassoon: Ah, sweet, so it's legit!
[00:34:40] <hassoon> * game *
[00:37:02] <DPA> Aww, I was so close. A tie...
[00:38:07] <lmat> Tie is as good as you can get! (right?)

[07:02:55] <Rockwood> not any other motive to disturb you
[07:04:13] <FunkyBob> so, under 500pks you set the grid to... layout with the button below the input
[07:04:18] <FunkyBob> otherwise, it fits well
[07:04:19] <FunkyBob> so...
[07:04:23] <FunkyBob> what's the problem, again?
[07:04:38] <undeclared> in case anyone was looking for a solution to mine, I just made the width 100%, adding padding for 25% on both sides, and it scrolls perfectly now instead of a static width
[07:05:29] <Rockwood> its not looks responsive
[07:05:36] <FunkyBob> undeclared: ooh, thanks for closing the loop.
[07:05:46] <FunkyBob> Rockwood: odd, since it's your responsive styling that's doing it
[07:06:10] <undeclared> FunkyBob: hehe, hopefully it helps someone else
[07:06:28] <FunkyBob> undeclared: that's the plan :)

[07:07:17] <Rockwood> what am missing
[07:07:22] <FunkyBob> you say there... when the screen is 500px of smaller... make 'two' below 'one'

[07:08:37] <Rockwood> thanks
[07:08:41] <Rockwood> means

[07:12:55] <Rockwood> <FunkyBob> well, what did you _think_ that bit did?  really you question is confusing me and indicating for another problem as well as in code
[07:13:05] <Rockwood> your question
[07:13:14] <FunkyBob> you wrote some CSS
[07:13:18] <Rockwood> yes
[07:13:18] <FunkyBob> it didn't do what you thought it did
[07:13:23] <FunkyBob> I want to know what you thought it would do
[07:13:37] <FunkyBob> what you expected
[07:15:47] <Rockwood> expectation from view is this -> https://codesandbox.io/s/material-demo-forked-lygbv?file=/gym.css now i know what fault, the code works as in wrote it
[07:16:10] <Rockwood> code wasn't fault my knowledge was the fulat
[07:16:13] <Rockwood> fault
[07:16:26] <Rockwood> thanks for it
[07:16:28] <FunkyBob> ok, i'm giving up now...
[07:16:38] <FunkyBob> getting details from you is a worthless effort

[07:17:36] <Rockwood> i am not good in English
[07:17:44] <Rockwood> amy be this is making cause
[07:17:49] <Rockwood> may
[07:18:57] <Rockwood> i expected responsive layout nothing else
[07:19:52] <Rockwood> all thing was looks fine in html excluded that issue input and button wasn't inline
[07:19:59] <Rockwood> now its fine
[07:20:06] <Rockwood> i made corrected it

[07:41:11] <FunkyBob> so despite describing the areas to appear on separate lines, you expected them to appear on the same line?
[07:41:55] <Rockwood> yes
[07:42:10] <Rockwood> i wanna that in same line
[07:42:32] <Rockwood> after your hint i got the real cause
[07:42:34] <FunkyBob> this is why I was asking what you thought that css did... because it seems to _very_ clearly show putting them on separate lines
[07:43:13] <Rockwood> thanks
[07:43:51] <Rockwood> you know the things better and still i am noob
[07:43:56] <FunkyBob> I guess the problem is... I'm trying to help you find where you went wrong and why.... and you don't care about that, you just want it to work.
[07:44:35] <Rockwood> i putted is single in gird area
[07:44:42] <Rockwood> i putted in single in gird area
[07:44:56] <Rockwood> that was my fault
[07:45:23] <lind{at}yahoo> hey FunkyBob!
[07:45:31] <Rockwood> and that time i am expecting for same line
[07:45:47] <FunkyBob> Rockwood: yes... why did you think it would be on the same line?
[07:46:52] <lind{at}yahoo> I apparently have to detect a user agent for DuckDuckGo on https://thespaceforce.world, looks like it has the edge behavior where the navigation is not included in the viewport
[07:47:21] <FunkyBob> lind{at}yahoo: when you say 'the navigation'... do yu mean the browser chrome?  url bar, back button, etc?
[07:47:33] <lind{at}yahoo> yeah
[07:47:51] <FunkyBob> bizarre... is it possibly related to that auto-hiding?
[07:48:09] <Rockwood> what is your question's real point?
[07:48:17] <lind{at}yahoo> Chrome and Safari count it so I use 87vh and then do a javascript to detect mobile edge by inspecting the useragent and applying a .edge class to the body
[07:48:29] <Rockwood> as a user or technically?
[07:48:35] <lind{at}yahoo> and set it to 100vh
[07:48:45] <FunkyBob> Rockwood: as I said... to find out where your thinking went wrong... and why... so we can fix it and you can avoid problems in the future
[07:48:53] <FunkyBob> oh, you were asking lind{at}yahoo ?
[07:49:10] <lind{at}yahoo> I was unclear on that as well
[07:49:36] <Rockwood> bcz input and button looks good in single
[07:49:44] <Rockwood> and reasonable
[07:50:20] <FunkyBob> Rockwood: no argument there... I agree it looks better inline.
[07:50:34] <Rockwood> another point is
[07:50:55] <Rockwood> i don't need much width of input and button
[07:51:05] <Rockwood> so space was looks odd
[07:51:24] <Rockwood> that why i think both thing better in same line
[07:51:26] <FunkyBob> that was never in question
[07:51:43] <FunkyBob> lind{at}yahoo: i have vague memories of someone else having similar problems years ago...
[07:52:20] <Rockwood> my theory was that
[07:53:36] <FunkyBob> Rockwood: your theory was what?
[07:53:42] <FunkyBob> oh... that it would look better on the one line?
[07:53:47] <Rockwood> yes
[07:53:50] <FunkyBob> ...
[07:54:02] <FunkyBob> that doesn't explain why you wrote the CSS the way you did
[07:54:12] <FunkyBob> we _know_ you wanted it on the same line, since that's what you said right at the start
[07:55:08] <Rockwood> are you asking about whole code?
[07:55:15] <FunkyBob> no
[07:55:18] <Rockwood> i means of css
[07:55:21] <FunkyBob> the bit that was wrong
[07:55:25] <FunkyBob> the bit that needed changing
[07:55:27] <FunkyBob> that one piece
[07:55:38] <FunkyBob> you wrote it, thinking it would do something....
[07:55:40] <FunkyBob> all I've been asking
[07:55:51] <FunkyBob> is for you to describe your thinking around why you wrote it that way
[07:56:02] <Rockwood> looks better and i need small both of em
[07:56:34] <FunkyBob> and this is why I gve up
[07:56:50] <FunkyBob> you keep answering the wrong question... one that wasn't asked
[07:56:59] <Rockwood> below input a button is not suits at my requirement too

[11:32:05] <smallville7123> CSS has a notion of View and ViewGroup right?
[11:34:51] <pavonia> What are those? Container and base elements?
[11:35:06] <smallville7123> yes
[11:36:25] <smallville7123> eg https://www.goer.org/HTML/intermediate/margins_and_padding/
[11:40:53] <pavonia> In HTML most elements can have further children
[11:41:31] <smallville7123> ok
[11:41:52] <smallville7123> is there such an element that will layout its children automatically?
[11:42:00] <smallville7123> for example, a grid
[11:42:16] <smallville7123> or a list
[11:43:32] <pavonia> Well, all elements do that. I can't find a list of all elements without content, <input> and <br> come to mind
[11:44:24] <smallville7123> for example, <list> <text> <text> <text> <endList>
[11:44:29] <smallville7123> or something like that
[11:44:49] <pavonia> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Empty_element
[11:45:07] <pavonia> ^ those are the "Views"
[11:45:30] <pavonia> There is <ul>, <ol> and <dl> for lists
[11:45:30] <smallville7123> in which list might automatically position and resize its children to fit within its given height and width, eg it might position all children at 10 pixels with a height of 10 pixels and a width of 20 pixels
[11:46:13] <smallville7123> assuming the list itself is layed out at 30 pixels high and 20 pixels wide
[11:47:18] <pavonia> I'm not sure what exactly you are asking for. You can make almost all elements arrange their children in a certain way by using CSS styles on them
[11:47:39] <pavonia> Do you have a specific problem to solve?
[11:48:04] <smallville7123> what happens when a child defines its own size
[11:48:24] <smallville7123> eg modifies its own margin's
[11:48:33] <pavonia> Depends on the styles of the child and the parent
[11:49:25] <smallville7123> what happens when a child sets it's margin to say 400 height, but its parent needs to set its margin to 240 height ?
[11:49:27] <pavonia> Usually the parent respects the children's styles, but that's not always the case (e.g. in tables or flex layouts)
[11:49:56] <smallville7123> assuming the parent is a table
[11:50:53] <pavonia> The parent can't set the margin of the child
[11:52:06] <smallville7123> how can the parent make sure that the child is 240 pixels height?
[11:53:04] <smallville7123> would would the child simply end up being cropped if its height is less than the height chosen by the parent?
[11:53:10] <smallville7123> wait would*
[11:53:29] <smallville7123> wait would the child simply end up being cropped if its height is greater than the height chosen by the parent?      *
[11:54:30] <pavonia> It Depends™. Without more specific context that's basically the answer to most of your questions :S
[11:54:33] <smallville7123> or out of view if its top/left margins are greater than what the parent decides?
[11:55:33] <smallville7123> for example, if parent draws child at 0,0,400,400, but child has margines of 500, 500, 30, 30, or margines of 200, 200, 700, 700,   would the child simply end up cropped/stretched/out of view?
[11:56:47] <pavonia> It depends. If the parent is told to crop, it would crop, if it's told to stretch it would stretch etc.
[11:57:27] <smallville7123> so are margin's unsafe to use?
[11:58:03] <smallville7123> eg you do not know what your parent will require so you may accidentally go out of view, or end up parially cropped
[11:58:07] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[11:58:41] <smallville7123> by setting margins that you think are safe with the assumption of a big enough area
[12:00:12] <pavonia> Well, you usually don't define your styles for each element individually but in context to other elements. If there's not much enough room to display an element, you can't do much about it, you have to rely on the parent's styles
[12:00:35] <smallville7123> hmm ok
[12:02:53] <smallville7123> is it recommended for a child to set its own margins?
[12:05:21] <smallville7123> eg should margins only be used with caution?
[12:06:50] <pavonia> You may have a misconception of how CSS works. An element doesn't set it's apperance on it's own, it's all done by style sheets (or JS)
