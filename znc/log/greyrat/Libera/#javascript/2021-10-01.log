[06:30:44] <Intelo> What max line of code are idea for a) a single file b) a single function?
[06:31:34] <earendel> 23
[06:32:13] <earendel> a decimal type would be nice.. or you would have to implement sum, multiply etc. and to ensure correct rounding. and eventually still fail.

[07:57:02] <ashnur> maybe not dreaming :D
[07:58:11] <KevinX> I have a cursory interest in game dev, but mainly because I want to know everything
[07:58:34] <Rockwood> ashnur, i am working on that and its take lots of time like years or near about years
[07:58:55] <Rockwood> if you are alone
[07:58:58] <ashnur> on what
[07:59:05] <Rockwood> game development
[07:59:11] <KevinX> My advice would be to not take years
[07:59:21] <Rockwood> year
[07:59:26] <Rockwood> s by mistake
[07:59:36] <ashnur> main limitation for me is just that i have to do another work for simply sustainment, can't just do this
[07:59:39] <Rockwood> if you are one man army
[08:00:12] <KevinX> I'd only do that is you are financially secure already and want to build your dream game which will probably suck to everyone else (which is probably what I will do someday)

[08:05:39] <Rockwood> but not same
[08:06:07] <Rockwood> its looks bad and outdated but my is advanced
[08:06:41] <ashnur> yeah, my old game was text based too, obviously :D, it doesn't make it too much easier
[08:06:50] <ashnur> but I want actual 3d and controls
[08:08:28] <Rockwood> yeah its need team work but i am making own everything

[08:08:52] <Rockwood> every idea is mine
[08:09:03] <ashnur> best way to do it

[08:09:43] <ashnur> but that's not what I mean, I don't mean a game like what you usually see, just 3d as in I want to use shaders for performance. But would be simple

[08:25:36] <KevinX> If just a good game, you could build a prototype in any engine, raise the capital, then keep improving it or rebuild

[08:27:03] <ashnur> it's not a dream game, lol
[08:28:27] <KevinX> then start marketing it now, build a prototype, get a steam page, build the community, raise funds, quit job, finally build the game
[08:28:32] <ashnur> but this is not a dichotomy between dream games and profitable games, you can be successful with games that are unique, think Jonathan Blow kind of stuff

[10:22:09] <Maxdamantus> eg, here's a really big function that draws a motorbike with a person on it: https://github.com/Maxdamantus/recplay/blob/master/src/recRender.ts#L206
[10:22:58] <Maxdamantus> It's useful having that function as a unit, since the overall drawing logic should be able to call it separately from drawing the level that's meant to be behind the bike.
[10:23:20] <Maxdamantus> and it can be reused to draw multiple bikes/people.

[11:21:43] <Maxdamantus> (fine-grained, depending on many stubs/mocks)
[11:22:52] <Maxdamantus> generally nowadays we have a mechanism for mocking the database and the user interactions, and all the other code just runs as it would in production.
[11:24:24] <earendel> that stubs/mocks are supposed to mime some runtime environment right? like all that is not part of the unit (browser, db, services blah)

[11:33:27] <Maxdamantus> The mock shouldn't be responsible for that. If you're trying to test that you can't create the same user twice, that should be up to some logic in the application, and that should be testable using the mock database.

[18:52:01] <banana_> characteristic is the floor
[18:52:28] <banana_> ceiling would be 1000

[18:53:12] <hassoon_> banana_: https://i.imgur.com/OhVxOYx.png
[18:53:20] <hassoon_> something like that
[18:53:52] <banana_> 2^3 is 1000
[18:54:02] <sheetjs> base 2
[18:54:13] <sheetjs> in the same way 10^3 is 1000 base 10
[18:54:16] <banana_> yep thanks

[20:29:54] <systemfault> Using common JS idioms... let's say that NestJS isn't exactly great.
[20:30:27] <austincheney> yeah, i don't really see the point.  On the node side its really just a matter of familiarity of Node's API, asynchronous flow control, and callbacks (though node is extending its API to support promises as an alternative)

[22:19:47] <banana_> weird, eslint <glob path> --fix isn't fixing certain rules unless I use the exact relative path
[22:21:47] <banana_> my glob pattern is base-directory/**/*.js I thought that found all js files recursively

[22:33:43] <ljharb> banana_: don't use globs

[22:38:10] <qswz> the only drawback with bikes is the presence of cars around

[22:41:04] <ljharb> banana_: yes. it defers to the config, and thus the command is more reproducible and discoverable
[22:41:05] <systemfault> Simplar: The easiest way I can think of is to create a FormData from the form and then append the blob/file
[22:41:36] <Simplar> systemfault: I meant, so it will trigger the event that input type file accepted the new file
[22:41:44] <banana_> ok thanks. I like the layman way of saying it "less typing"
[22:42:18] <Simplar> or you mean I can push my blob into FormData, and then append it to input dom node
