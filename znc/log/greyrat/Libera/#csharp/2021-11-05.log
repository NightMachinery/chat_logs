[08:28:51] <moose> From a security perspective.
[08:29:21] <niston> I'm just looking around a bit because handwriting custom ORMs gets tiresome
[08:29:47] <moose> I just use the built-in SQL client stuff and just write code.
[08:29:56] <moose> But I also don't use dynamic queries.
[08:30:11] <niston> System.Data.SqlClient ?
[08:30:22] <moose> Indeed
[08:30:30] <moose> I map by hand.
[08:30:51] <moose> It's actually not even difficult. I am not sure why we need ORMs or automapper or dapper
[08:31:03] <niston> its what I use as well. then SqlConnection, SqlTransaction, SqlCommand and SqlReader if needed. And yes, mapping by hand via parametrized SQL queries.
[08:31:18] <moose> Sounds great. What's the problem? :)
[08:32:10] <niston> its tediuous
[08:32:13] <niston> *tedious
[08:33:22] <moose> I find it a little relaxing.
[08:33:38] <moose> It also means I have to think about my data domain a bit more beforehand, which I like.
[08:34:03] <moose> I write out my interfaces for repositories and DTOs first then write code that should work once you drop the implementations in.
[08:34:16] <moose> I find my stuff is less buggy on the first test than if I had used an ORM.
[08:35:04] <niston> I've been writing pages and pages of this stuff (link)
[08:35:25] <niston> my eyes are bleeding
[08:35:28] <niston> hrhr

[15:18:22] <Nasp> Where ether fuq did that smiley come from
[15:18:59] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Well it ensures you follow a norm
[15:19:07] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: And you get audited (every year) on following that norm
[15:19:28] <MatthiasVance> So it makes it easier for companies (or governments) with specific quality or security demands to be able to do business with you
[15:19:35] <Nasp> Yeah so I've heard, but it does it ensure quality?
[15:20:09] <MatthiasVance> I'd say yes, because in the audit you have to prove you have thought about all the different points of the specification and also that you are following it
[15:20:10] <Nasp> Like should certain stuff be fixed or is it okay to just follow the process
[15:20:27] <MatthiasVance> ISO 27001 isn't too strict about most things, because it's more a guideline
[15:20:38] <MatthiasVance> There's also a corresponding NEN thing that actually prescribes measures
[15:21:07] <MatthiasVance> So where 27001 says "Ensure that communication streams are protected" (somewhat), the other one will state "You have to use a minimum of TLS 1.2"
[15:21:42] <Nasp> Yeah I remember some of that
[15:21:43] <MatthiasVance> So if you use coding guidelines and a process and whatnot you're already off to a good start
[15:22:09] <Nasp> Corporate can help with it and we were trying to do it, but I think we need to hire 5 more people to be able to do it
[15:22:18] <MatthiasVance> wow okay
[15:22:19] <MatthiasVance> :D
[15:22:26] <MatthiasVance> Also depends on company size of course

[15:44:35] <MatthiasVance> Indoors ;p

[15:44:44] <MatthiasVance> (or tablet)
[15:44:47] <jmer> You must have a large bathttub
[15:44:59] <MatthiasVance> I row on only 17L of water

[15:47:04] <jmer> aaww... Way to ruin my mental image of you rowing away like a madman in a tub with water splashing all over

[20:12:02] <MizMahem> Avalonia has some basic built in ones for you, but yeah, for WPF either you make your VM conform to what the View wants, or you write a converter.
[20:12:12] <MizMahem> Have you considered making the VM conform instead?
[20:12:19] <MizMahem> That's what it's there for.
[20:12:32] <MizMahem> To model the data in a way the View can accept.
[20:13:01] <Bilz> I could do that as well, yes :) Just figuring out my options. Still new to WPF coming from 5 years of WinForms.
[20:13:13] <Bilz> MizMahem, do you do "work" in the ViewModel.
[20:13:39] <MizMahem> well, define "Work"

[20:17:01] <MizMahem> well, it's a fuzzy definition.
[20:17:14] <MizMahem> but I fall back on SRP.
[20:18:19] <MizMahem> Your ViewModel should only be changing when the way your View interacts with its data/the rest of the app changes.
[20:18:37] <MatthiasVance> Suchiman: Fuuck it seems it doesn't support F#
[20:18:57] <MizMahem> So for example if you are changing where you download data from or something, or that doesn't seem like a change that should change your VM.
[20:19:11] <Suchiman> MatthiasVance: i don't see how it would need to :P ?
[20:19:26] <MatthiasVance> Suchiman: idk either but I create a new C# unit test project and it works fine
[20:19:40] * MatthiasVance dives deeper
[20:19:51] <MizMahem> The VM should just have a method like "GetData" or something, that interacts with another class that actually gets the data, if that makes sense?
[20:19:53] * MizMahem shrugs.
[20:20:02] <MatthiasVance> nope, can't find any other differences
[20:20:14] <Bilz> yeah, it kind of makes sense :) thank you
[20:20:20] <MatthiasVance> there was one GenerateProgramFile set to false in the F# project but reverting that makes no difference

[20:57:13] <bomb> then stop eventing?

[20:58:51] <constxd> bomb: no this is the part that i need help with

[20:59:31] <bomb> just assign your even to the window
[21:02:03] <MatthiasVance> redoc: No, I haven't. Also it always feels like all the cool stuff happens in VS because it does, and then if it's interesting enough they invest time to develop it in Rider

[21:02:32] <constxd> from a view
[21:02:35] <constxd> code-behind
[21:02:46] <constxd> wish this was javascript and everything was global
[21:03:09] <bomb> <Window>
[21:03:37] <constxd> yes but how to refer to it from the c# code
[21:03:43] <bomb> I mean, if you finished a decent tutorial on WPF, you could answer 90% of your own questions XD
[21:04:08] <bomb> just like how do you refer an XAML button in C#?
[21:04:12] <constxd> I'm learning so quickly from you kings
[21:04:39] <constxd> when you have a Name or x:Name on the element then it's defined in the corresponding code-behind
[21:04:43] <constxd> but
[21:05:06] <constxd> my <Window> is in MainWindow.xaml, and i want to attach a event to that <Window> from Foo.xaml.cs
[21:05:13] <constxd> is that bad
[21:06:20] <constxd> ah i found it: Application.Current.MainWindow.MouseLeftButtonUp += () => King();
