[00:39:37] <th0rne> Is there something magical about this bootx64.efi file, can I just format the drive or do I need to save it?
[00:40:14] <MrElendig> depends on what you are trying to do
[00:40:52] <th0rne> Turns out that this machine shipped with windows, so I'd like to format the drive.
[00:40:56] <MrElendig> and you can always file it
[00:41:04] <MrElendig> just format everything then

[05:16:03] <sudoforge> i'm wondering why it doesn't autoconnect via bluetooth after powering it on. i always need to manually connect to it, even though it's trusted.
[05:18:15] <sangy> so, if you drop into bluetootctl and then turn the MT2 do you see anything funny?

[12:28:18] <Skaface> or can i somehow preserve the permissions of a specific directory?

[12:42:24] <mpan> sri19: for Arch you offer the resulting package file (*.pkg.tar.zst). Though you should also offer a plain PKGBUILD. As for “derivatives”, ask on their channels — they are not supported here.

[12:53:17] <lambda> I recreated my build chroot recently and now /etc/passwd only contains a single entry for `root` and none of the sysusers, is that how it's supposed to be? it makes sense considering base-devel doesn't contain systemd, but I don't know if packages are allowed to rely on the default sysusers.
[12:54:24] <mpan> lambda: base is also expected to be there.
[12:55:41] <lambda> is it though? I know there was a discussion about this on the mailing lists recently, but I though the consensus was that base-devel is an implicit `makedepends`, and base is only an implicit `depends` (and not expected to be installed in the build environment)

[13:54:38] <torwag> Hey still struggle to get my wired network working with systemd-resolved and Networkmanager. Does someone (yesterday there was one) use this combo? Interestingly on the command line names resolving is ok, but on the browsers it takes >15 sec or timesout 
[13:55:15] <grawity> how are you testing the command-line resolving
[13:55:51] <torwag> If I enter manual DNS server entries in NetworkManager.... do I need to set the local stub 127.0.0.53 or the desired addresses?
[13:56:09] <torwag> grawity: yes I did, using drill I get names resolved within ms
[13:56:26] <grawity> the latter; NetworkManager already knows about the stub resolver
[13:56:28] <torwag> not sure it is dns at all. Maybe someting else
[13:56:38] <grawity> you don't want it to be configuring systemd-resolved to query 127.0.0.53
[13:57:00] <grawity> that was not a yes/no question, but `drill` and `dig` don't actually use the system resolver, they go straight to DNS
[13:57:23] <grawity> browsers *do* use the system resolver, they use libnss_resolve first, and don't look at /etc/resolv.conf unless it fails
[13:57:24] <torwag> oh sorry overread the 'how'
[13:57:57] <grawity> so it sounds like systemd-resolved might be not working at all, and you just have the actual servers in /etc/resolv.conf (instead of stub resolver)?
[13:58:21] <grawity> check where that file is symlinked to (if it is), and try `resolvectl query` and `getent ahosts` both

I figured I would be better off using the installer than trying to make arch work as a total novice.
