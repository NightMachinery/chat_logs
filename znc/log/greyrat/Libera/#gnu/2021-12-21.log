[00:59:52] <epony> wrong
[01:00:00] <epony> GNU is a userland util set
[01:00:03] <irelativism> openbsd keeps away from most GNU projects

[01:00:48] <epony> userland is the largest attack surface you can get
[01:01:03] <irelativism> GNU is all the packages a os needs without counting with the kernel
[01:01:06] <epony> and it's expanded and fruitful to many more access and exposure
[01:01:17] <GNUHacker> https://gnu.org/gnu
[01:01:31] <irelativism> sure that is why stuff like dwm are the most popular among openbsd users
[01:01:34] <GNUHacker> epony: ^ learn about kid
[01:01:38] <epony> nope, GNU is just a movement and software vendor of UNIX replacement that is not UNIX
[01:01:46] <epony> you're the kid ;-)
[01:01:58] <irelativism> HyperbolaBSD intends to bring copyleft to the openbsd codebase
[01:02:04] <epony> wrong
[01:02:09] <irelativism> to me that is the ultimate solution
[01:02:16] <epony> it intends to dename another project (defacement)
[01:02:30] <irelativism> linux kernel is far from a hope on this comunnity
[01:02:38] <epony> nobody in hyperbola wrote anything BSD in their lifetime
[01:02:43] <epony> EVER.
[01:02:54] <irelativism> BSD has a problem with licensing
[01:03:13] <epony> no, you have problems with restrictions and limitations of small subset of rights and freedoms
[01:03:15] <irelativism> Hyperbola project is just trying to bring copyleft to BSD codebase
[01:03:22] <epony> wrong
[01:03:29] <iShareFreedom> stop trolling
[01:03:34] <epony> it can not bring ANYTHING to the BSD codebase, it can just clone and deface it
[01:03:40] <irelativism> wrong is relative given is only your opinion
[01:03:47] <epony> no, it's a fact
[01:04:03] <irelativism> "deface" is also very relative given it is again you opinion
[01:04:09] <irelativism> good effort though
[01:04:16] <epony> and the claims of GNUHacker nad irelativism are incorrect, which is also wrong
[01:04:38] <irelativism> a copyleft openbsd like kernel is a very positive direction for our movement
[01:04:51] <epony> you mean you can not write another kernel ;-)
[01:04:58] <irelativism> so we can have an actual usable alternative to bloated linux kernel
[01:05:03] <epony> so you have to get it from somewhere and strip it of its license
[01:05:04] <Noisytoot> HyperbolaBSD complies with OpenBSD's license.
[01:05:11] <GNUHacker> im in GNU system just now
[01:05:33] <irelativism> is not strip you are understand it the other way arround epony 
[01:05:44] <epony> well, if you say incorrect things, be prepared that someone says something correct as a reply

[01:06:50] <irelativism> BSD license allows for relicense to GPL and other copylefts
[01:07:03] <epony> it's a project to extend UNIX and make it free and it succeeded despite legal opposition from corporations and other false freedom re-implementers (that happen to be license strippers)

[01:07:25] <Noisytoot> irelativism, Not relicensing, but derivative works.
[01:07:28] <iShareFreedom> BSD arent a license, is *family* of licenses
[01:07:31] <irelativism> also Hyperbola project developers me included feel permissive licensing are to slack to protect their users
[01:07:49] <epony> actually BSD is a license that was reduced over years
[01:07:53] <iShareFreedom> all of them are weak licenses
[01:07:57] <iShareFreedom> without copyleft
[01:07:59] <epony> but it's a software project, NOT A LICENSE

[01:09:29] <irelativism> iShareFreedom: I was as well but the most recent direction of the linux kernel project doesnt bring me much hope
[01:09:31] <GNUHacker> linux-libre is a part of GNU Project, so GNU/Linux-libre is GNU system

[01:09:53] <Noisytoot> False.
[01:09:57] <epony> CORRECT.
[01:10:00] <iShareFreedom> if you dont use licenses you are using nonfree sofware, becouse the default license are nonfree

[01:16:42] <epony> you use software as law framework

[01:35:38] <jkk> soo most 'secure' os is open bsd?
[01:35:44] <epony> no
[01:36:02] <epony> the most secure OS is software that you validated yourself up to your capacity
[01:36:17] <epony> if your capacity is low, you can not confirm it
[01:36:42] <jkk> so far I have learned - linux kernel has blobs - gnu kernel has no blobs and open bsd yet to check
[01:36:57] <jkk> well yes I cant say I have read kernel code and understood it Xd
[01:37:01] <epony> the word blobs is false terming
[01:37:05] <jkk> why
[01:37:16] <jkk> closed source software
[01:37:24] <epony> it's meant to represent "binary" bulk distributed inserts
[01:37:30] <epony> which is software implants

[01:39:03] <epony> can you run it on your server?
[01:39:18] <jkk> run what? openwrt is a router software

[01:40:37] <epony> irelativism, no need to announce your presence without saying anything ;-)
[01:40:38] <irelativism> its a shame because you are interumping interesting conversations like the kernel one
[01:40:54] <epony> well, go on
[01:40:55] <irelativism> also you reading the linux kernel is probably bulshit
[01:41:08] <irelativism> linux kernel has 1.5 million LOC
[01:41:09] <jkk> well if router hardware backdoors can not be actualised due to lack of proprietary  software  - it can detect possible pc hardware backdoors - right?
[01:42:04] <irelativism> also you need at least 5 years to get familiarized with it
[01:42:11] <jkk> irelativism: who is reading it? 
[01:42:29] <irelativism> apperently epony 
[01:42:41] <irelativism> according to that peers words
[01:43:00] <epony> you need a quality reference material, that should be less than a book size

[01:43:25] <jkk> can you provide a link?
[01:43:27] <irelativism> he is just a troll trying to disrupt communication between members for a specific agenda or to fill is own egocentric bag

[01:43:58] <epony> irelativism, I think you're describing yourself well

[01:47:48] <irelativism> openbsd is more free than freebsd
[01:47:57] <epony> irelativism, no say

[01:49:16] <irelativism> there are still some blobs on openbsd

[01:49:22] <jkk> irelativism: makes sense, often things called free are not Xd
[01:49:28] <irelativism> but there was a project now dead

[01:50:44] <Noisytoot> epony, No. That's not what I said.
[01:50:50] <epony> while OpenBSD is "open" to contributions, if they are quality enough
[01:50:53] <epony> that is what you said
[01:51:15] <epony> you said that you want to talk about the demarkation zone between FSF and OSI
[01:51:20] <epony> which nobody cares about
[01:51:24] <Noisytoot> No. "Free" does not mean they have to accept contributions. I know what I said.

[01:51:38] <epony> you're saying it inefficiently
[01:51:41] <jkk> irelativism: so we can see different OS as free to a degree? why to a degree? intel cpu proprietary code.

[01:52:30] <epony> sure, and you're a real expert in choosing to disagree on anything ;-)
[01:52:36] <irelativism> no that is in the bios/uefi/coreboot jkk is mostly related to wifi and modem stuff
[01:53:04] <jkk> irelativism: yes i have had a look at coreboot faq :) to see which firmare code is hard to replace
[01:53:17] <jkk> to get an idea of whole
[01:53:19] <epony> wrong, system setup is mostly related to configuring the machine so that the kernel can recognise its setup details
[01:53:33] <irelativism> you can try libreboot if you are not that technical jkk 
[01:53:52] <irelativism> they only support 4/5 family of devices though
[01:54:00] <epony> BIOS/UEFI and BOOT loaders, are used to initialised the system and configure it
[01:54:18] <irelativism> so you would probably have to buy a specific model/brand of hardware secondhand to be able to use it
[01:54:43] <epony> and they are small and system dependent pieces of software that you do not and can not efficiently control and replace due to the "capitalist greed" of extracting profit
[01:54:48] <irelativism> libreboot only support s devices pre 2008 for intel

[01:56:00] <jkk> my mistake
[01:56:02] <jkk> The microcode updates alter the way instructions behave on the CPU. That means they affect the way the CPU works, in a very fundamental way. That makes it software. The updates are proprietary, and are software, so we exclude them from libreboot.

[04:18:58] <epony> so the notion that GNU is a successor and replacement for BSD or UNIX is false, they are a only overlapping slightly in the userland tooling and are "feature" and "lean" variations, with different conventions being style and taste, and waste, but only one of them is a complete operating system and only the other provides a compiler toolkit encumbered by license separation and usage / development / modifications restrictions, which lost in the long term due to 
[04:18:58] <epony> better approach to that from competing toolkits (which do not support the entire instruction sets and platforms, however)
[04:20:29] <epony> Unix is what GNU reimplements with "incompatible" extensions that do not get standardised (for their extensions and feature spills)
[04:21:24] <epony> most of these are somewhat meaningful, but many are not, and are "extras" that are in there for.. the convenience and customisation (captive) interfaces to the programmers and system operators
[04:22:15] <epony> applications target POSIX and much more "Linux" and rather it's Unix-like subset of the system calls and system functions
[04:23:17] <epony> "its" Unix-likeliness and correctness are lower / less truthful and more experimental and suitable to the interests of sponsoring vendors and commercial and large business companies
[04:23:57] <epony> (and consortiums of companies, that are not standards bodies / not committees, but beneficients of feature spillage for commercial profit on top of these ordered features)
[04:24:23] <epony> that's how business favours a fancier less compatible system (and free software gains sponsorship)
[04:24:58] <epony> you'd call that a win-win, but it is a loss, because it makes computing heavy and inefficient, which loses energy and results in slower progress and inefficiencies
[04:25:02] <epony> that eventually get wiped
[04:25:07] <epony> and don't enter standards
[04:25:44] <epony> that's why your hardware lives shorter, is more consumed by your "environment" than "serving you" and you get much more problems and fallout to handle
[04:26:38] <epony> it starts from the different approaches to application hosting (the runtime / environment being a midlayer / operators' interface and toolkits for application provisioning)
[04:26:49] *** jkk is now known as pidgin
[04:26:53] *** pidgin is now known as jkk
[04:27:08] <irelativism> please stop spamming
[04:27:20] <epony> and goes down to "system calls" and "kernel organisation" and "complexity of maintenance"
[04:27:27] <Noisytoot> GNU isn't only a compiler toolkit. There are many more GNU packages other than GCC.
[04:27:31] <epony> irelativism, is this your channel?

[04:28:36] <epony> GNU is an attempt at the application store.
[04:28:57] <epony> but in reality it's just a portable midlayer

[04:29:42] <epony> so it sits above the operating system internals, and relies on standardisation, but does not honour it outwards
[04:30:30] <epony> so is demanding, and captive, but results in less portable applications and lower chance of interoperable systems outside its own interests
[04:31:14] *** Quits: CaCode_ (~CaCode@user/cacode) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[04:31:14] <epony> that is why it is closer on the right to the more business systems and criticises them the most
[04:32:23] <epony> and is envious and competes with more permsisive and open systems (less license encumbered / more standards centric and closer to the Unix and POSIX / SUS and other)
[04:33:28] <epony> so, GNU claims it's the real freedom but it is protective and aggressive in its licensing, which is heavy and cumbersome and "propagating" and getting violated by commerce (which it tolerates for sponsorship)
[04:34:10] <irelativism> what the fuck are you talking about?
[04:34:13] <epony> in turn GNU violates the permissive license works and claims they are imported but it generates unclean export that can not go back due to spillage and excess
[04:35:05] <epony> irelativism, if you can not understand, read and ask, but raise your quality of questions a bit.
[04:35:06] <irelativism> the license explicitally says you can do whatever you want behisides simple 2/3/4 clauses
[04:35:25] <irelativism> you are a bot is that it
[04:35:31] <epony> irelativism, go fuck yourself
[04:35:58] <irelativism> oky dokey ;)

[04:36:03] <irelativism> funny ...
[04:36:27] <irelativism> you want me to fuck a donkey?
[04:36:47] <epony> so, GNU is an alternative userland to BSD systems and other Unix-like kernels
[04:36:59] <epony> irelativism, nobody cares..
[04:37:19] <irelativism> you seam to
[04:37:28] <epony> on a BSD system, for example FreeBSD or OpenBSD or NetBSD, there are all the GNU tools you like and know
[04:38:02] <irelativism> ehehe, if you are an actual person you are quite funny I have to say
[04:38:16] <epony> but the kernel is not "Linux" and has different system calls and operates in a leaner more expedient and compact way and provides higher quality system services and functions
[04:38:33] <epony> irelativism, can you do as I said earlier or not?
[04:40:13] <epony> while on a Linux-kernel plus GNU userland and tools you have no expectation of Unix being retained and kept correctly and reliably, despite it being there and supported, is hidden in the super-set of features and changed system calls, functions and libraries and toolkits and utilities differ
[04:40:56] <epony> so your applications will not be portable to BSD systems without you knowing or using portable techniques and the real standards compliant subset of all the excess of features and functions
[04:41:35] <epony> that is the main problem of GNU, standardisation and portability, and being replaced too easy by standards compliant complete systems
[04:42:01] <epony> (in fact, these systems do not replace it, they just existed before there was GNU as a project)

[05:01:04] <epony> irelativism, for simple learners, the GNU is closer to the operations mode of a business, than free software development in that it is a publishing house
[05:01:37] <epony> so it attracts people and projects with its licensing model and hosting services and occasionally sponsorship

[05:19:23] <epony> cause it sure is not.
[05:20:14] <epony> heard the same false claim about emacs and lisp ;-) and browsers
[05:20:22] <epony> quite funny if you think about it
[05:21:08] <epony> the real competition is between applications, not operating systems of freed Unix heritage
[05:21:35] <epony> while BSD freed UNIX, only GNU freed you from UNIX ;-)
[05:21:51] <epony> ain't that the funniest joke for the moment?
[05:22:22] <epony> it's incorrect, Microsoft, Apple and Google freed you from UNIX
[05:22:46] <epony> GNU supported its implementation of UNIX despite refuting it 3 times
[05:23:45] <epony> so UNIX actually lives, in both BSD and GNU extensions and reworks of UNIX.. that former claim of the zealot was unlearned and naively controversial
[05:24:01] <epony> and it lives for 50+ years
[05:25:32] <epony> only lisp and fortran are older and with us still despite falling into reimplementations as newer languages like scheme and others, and basic, pascal and python respectively
[05:26:48] <epony> even IBM can not compete with UNIX and has to have it, and buy it, and fund it and sponsor it, and repurchase it again and again
[05:37:22] <epony> there is really nothing to fight over, Unix won and it has legacy and descendants and all systems re-implement it, including applications, and runtime environments, and userlands, and system and application virtualisation, and emulation layers
[05:38:15] <epony> even commercial system vendors re-implement it, poorly and with defects, intentionally, for financial gains from artificial scarcity (application captive portals)
[05:39:02] <epony> if your favourite userland/runtime implements it with defects or non-standard variations.. think about it
[05:39:18] <epony> is it closer to captive portals or, is it closer to open worlds

[23:27:30] <cpach> good evening folks!
[23:27:39] <cpach> i'm trying to understand this command: 'find . -printf "%T@ %f\n"'
[23:27:48] <cpach> where can i find documentation regarding %f?
[23:28:01] <cpach> and also for '%T@'
[23:28:21] <cpach> should i look in the corutils documentation or in the findutils documentation?
