[17:03:23] <benwilson512> to your specific question: Because data cannot change, linked lists (which is what B and A are) can safely point to "other" linked lists without needing to copy them
[17:11:25] <trafficjam> benwilson512: i'll take a look, thanks ben

[18:53:49] <warmwaffles> I'll keep pestering the maintainer until I get some sort of response.
[18:54:17] <Ankhers> I meanm if it is bouncing, there is no pestering them. They are not receiving it if it bounces.
[18:54:41] <warmwaffles> Yea I need to do some more sleuthing
[18:55:20] <Ankhers> wink: I'm not quite sure what you mean.
[18:56:00] <benwilson512> wink: phx.server does not download from npmjs
[18:56:11] <wink> Ankhers: ok, so my corp proxy intercepts SSL and I had to use HEX_CACERTS_PATH - but phx.server calls esbuild (I think?)
[18:56:31] <Ankhers> wink: No, that is different.
[18:57:24] <wink> https://gist.github.com/winks/2a5fc7ab534ff515ca9487bc91db6937
[18:57:37] <Ankhers> the phx.server task just starts the application. You should have a config/dev.exs file that configures MyApp.Endpoint. There will be a key in there, `:watchers` that will run esbuild IFF you have it configured.

[19:14:35] <Ankhers> But the patch was also provided in the PR, so you could always send it as a PR.
[19:14:42] <Ankhers> Sorry, patch was provided in the issue.
[19:14:54] <wink> yeah, sure. "solved" as in knowing what to do :)
[19:17:03] <Ankhers> It is a good start at least.
[19:18:12] <wink> yeah it worked. these mitm proxies just suck. especially if you have this "mix of languages and package managers"
[19:18:50] <Ankhers> You don't have to use esbuild through phoenix though. You could do things differently. 
[19:18:58] <Ankhers> But mitm proxies always suck.
