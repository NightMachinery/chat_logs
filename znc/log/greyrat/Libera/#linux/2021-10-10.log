[04:18:31] <fikran> why not?

[04:22:23] <p`> so that'll probably just slow you down.  but if your bottleneck is actually cpu compression before it's disk io, it is indeed possible that could help.
[04:23:09] <fikran> ah...so disable compresssion?

[08:02:24] <genoobie> sheep so that's basically like broadcasting some kind of thing so I can scan the network to find it.
[08:02:38] <genoobie> there's literally over 1000 devices on the network.
[08:02:48] <sheep> it doesn't have to broadcast
[08:03:11] <sheep> whoever queries the name will send a multicast packet for it
[08:03:20] <jason1234> jaggz: it depends if your kernel, first, supports it. Archlinux has a kernel that does well with most hardiware, if ok, then xrandr is your friend.
[08:03:48] <TJ-> genoobie: there's thousands of devices on the network and no DHCP/DNS integration!?
[08:03:54] <genoobie> okay, so at home, I can type ssh raspberrypi and it works
[08:04:08] <genoobie> at work, it's "not found".
[08:04:09] <sheep> it's probably using an mDNS responder, probably avahi-daemon
[08:04:42] <jason1234> genoobie: to get SSH server, you need to do:   touch /boot/ssh     (and reboot) for quick running of ssh.   login: pi, password: raspberry.   Take care of brute force.

[08:05:54] <genoobie> I guess it's not.
[08:06:06] <jason1234> you can use the TFT Joy-it - it cost 20 euros
[08:06:22] <jaggz> jason1234, just stock debian kernel
[08:06:23] <TJ-> genoobie: both the Raspi and the other device (PC) need to be doing mDNS and/or LLMNR for the device to be found. They 'subscribe' to the multicast group and listen for queries for their <hostname>.local
[08:07:04] <genoobie> TJ- I guess what I am saying is that on my home network, I can "find" the pi by using the hostname.
[08:07:23] <genoobie> At work, I cannot.  That somehow points to something about the work network
[08:07:24] <jason1234> genoobie: here a configuration for getting your TFT working on raspbian: https://gitlab.com/openbsd98324/raspberry-tft     If you want BSD, we can write for you any drivers for your TFT.

[08:18:02] <MinusOne> genoobie, ./program should be sufficient. I think python <file> works too, but if you invoke it that way you need to know whether it is python (python2) or python3

[08:36:29] <naptastic> MinusOne, it's inevitable with a fibre channel SAN. Any drives will show up on the target _and_ the initiator, and they'll appear as normal SCSI devices in both places.
[08:37:22] <naptastic> There are ACLs so you can prevent multiple hosts from being able to mount the same volume, except sometimes you want that so that a VM can fail over immediately if an HV fails.

[08:39:49] <naptastic> p`, MinusOne, thanks for the feedback. I don't see a way multiple hosts could possibly negotiate over a swap volume or why they'd even try, so I'm just going to err on the side of caution and not put it in anybody's fstab. If I get KP's I'll know why. >_<

[08:47:01] <naptastic> have a look at Infiniband as well. It's not as cheap as fibre channel but per gigabit, the value is excellent. The only downside is the cabling...
[08:47:42] <naptastic> ...and it is also a completely different paradigm for networking. The kernel isn't involved at all; one application writes directly into the address space of an application running on a different host. It's bonkers.
[08:47:46] <p`> naptastic: but if you want san swaps you could setup your fstab to be by LABEL, and mkswap with a label that includes the hostname, to avoid confusion

[09:25:32] <doctor_who> naptastic: yeah, it's not hard to install if you can follow directions
[09:25:36] <kirk781> The default variant of Debian can screw things by shipping only FOSS by default. It wasn't even going into a gui in my case
[09:25:49] <doctor_who> I think simply following directions accurately is like a skill in itself anymore
[09:25:51] <kirk781> Unless I had ethernet, I couldn't fix it :sigh
[09:26:10] <naptastic> doctor_who, that's the best part of Arch: the wiki. And you don't even have to be running arch to benefit from it. Same thing with Gentoo.
[09:26:16] <Chanakan5591> debra: you should go look at the docker website on installing docker on debian, so then you will get the more recent version
[09:26:17] <electr0n> well, not all installations have a default target as a display manager.

[09:27:01] <doctor_who> for grognards, the stuff is nice and straight forward

[09:27:35] <naptastic> doctor_who, it seems that way because the barrier to entry is so much lower for system operation. So you can get people who are competent enough, until something they've never seen shows up. Then they need help.

[11:26:31] <kubast2> joo, you can in general cat files > /dev/null ensuring that you read all of the files before launching them in that slow program and those caching them; you can't really hint the file system to cache files in memory ahead of time as far as I know
[11:26:49] <hexnewbie> joo: Reading them with ‘find /location/of/the/files -type f -exec cat {} + > /dev/null’ before the run of the program will cache them. The combined time, obviously, wouldn't be faster (may be slower due to several factors), but it can help in several situations, e.g. if the timing of the program is important (and you run cat a minute earlier), or the server is down while it runs (but not during th
[11:27:06] <kubast2> so in short if you read the files with a different program, it will get cached(generally speaking, there might also be some algorithm recognizing often accessed cache from rarerly accessed cache)
[11:27:14] <hexnewbie> but not during the cat)
[11:27:28] <joo> I am already working with the cached result i assume, because the 4-5.000 textfiles are read on every run of the command which is being run many times a minute by the user
[11:27:46] <joo> or maybe they are too small to cache (less than 300 bytes each)h

[12:31:30] <elzar> Hi. we have a system with hard disks attached via SAN (Storage Area Network). According to iostat and nmon, the disk utilization is at 100%, and our database is showing problems. I'm wondering if the 100% disk utilization is a good indicator for the hard drives not being able to handle the IO, or if there is a better metric? Because the manpage of iostat says this about disk utilization: 'for

[16:11:41] <p`> joo: that will make newly created files group-owned by the "users" group.  but users creating files will still have their own umasks, so you can either force a different system-wide umask, or for each of those users, or maybe just setup a cron that does like chmod -R g+w /data to force group write back on
[16:11:51] <hexnewbie> Edu4rdSHL: Sounds like a feature of a gaming mice. You activated some gaming macro?
[16:12:09] <p`> joo: it's the setgid bit, which adjusts group-ownership of new files to the group owner of the dir
[16:12:13] <joo> what would the system wide umask be then?
[16:12:29] <p`> joo: you'd probably want 002 instead of 022
[16:12:54] <Edu4rdSHL> hexnewbie, I though that too and it was likely to be the cause... but I have connected another keyboard and the result is the same.
[16:13:00] <rindolf> Edu4rdSHL: hi, did you try xkb yet?

[16:13:50] <p`> joo: things can still get fudged by programs that set their own umask tho, so, might want a timer or cron anyway to force it all

[16:47:53] <joo> ok now i understand, You just substract from 666 for files or 777 for directories, then you get the umask value
[16:48:05] <joo> or do a bitwise something
[16:48:23] <xrogaan> joo: so if your user runs a software, that software can change its own umask to whatever it wants without affecting the system. You can see that through /proc/[pid]/status
[16:48:44] <joo> yes ofcause
[16:48:56] <xrogaan> You can't force users to use a specific umask.
[16:49:02] <xrogaan> probably

[19:18:14] <Hanii> The config dialogue in the system settings? That just gives me a choice between "Flat" or "Adaptive" for me.
[19:18:28] <hexnewbie> And a slider, which goes from negative something to positive something
[19:19:22] <Hanii> What property are you setting in xinput? "libinput Accel Speed" seems like the obvious choice, but that seems to control mouse speed rather than acceleration? And I don't see any other properties to do with it
[19:19:59] <hexnewbie> libinput Accel Speed is the one I have at -0.45

[20:37:57] <nomagno[m]> Zogatribe: You seem to be confusing important concepts here (don't care if it is a troll, this is a nice piece of information). There are two Unix specifications, POSIX, and the superset Single Unix Specification. These define what 'unix-like' means, mostly. You have five 'levels' of UNIX-ness. Contains Unix source code / Single Unix Specification Certified / POSIX Certified / POSIX Compatible. (Almost) no modern operating system contains any
[20:37:57] <nomagno[m]> Unix source code, at least not in a copyright-enforceable manner. MacOS is Single Unix Specification Certified, AKA they took FreeBSD, modified it, and paid The Open Group a lot of money to give them a badge. There are a few (awfully specific) POSIX/Unix-certified BSD and/or Linux distributios, but this doesn't really give them any merit other than recognizing they try to fix POSIX deviations in a timely fashion. Most FOSS Unix-like operating
[20:37:57] <nomagno[m]> systems and their components, see the GNU coreutils, glibc, musl, BSD utils, kFreeBSD, kOpenBSD, kNetBSD, the Mach microkernel (which MacOS uses), Hurd, etc. Are VERY VERY Unix-compatible, arguably fully POSIX/SUS-compliant. There is no shame in not being very compliant either, see Redox

[23:38:01] <twainwek> Dagmar would be able to answer this one after he finishes his rants
[23:38:06] <Akuli> so this is how you create a daemon process :D
[23:38:08] <twainwek> when he comes by
[23:38:13] <brentaarnold> You might enjoy the Topre Realforce boards better if you're coming from that kind of keyboard rather than an MX.
[23:38:14] <knotMez> brentaarnold maybe with knock off switches?
[23:38:21] <msfninja> brentaarnold: it totally doesnt look comfortable writing code on it all day to me
[23:38:36] <knotMez> I O ringed mine
[23:38:43] <TheGuestMovie> who was talking about Godot earlier?
[23:38:52] <brentaarnold> msfninja: You just need a split mechanical keyboard
[23:38:54] <knotMez> I want to get double shot keys
[23:39:03] <brentaarnold> Totally ergonomic

[23:39:42] <f843d0> Akuli: might work with pkill -P [pid_of_shell]
[23:39:43] <brentaarnold> Yeah, I use the POMs on my Filco and I have a Topre Realforce for a daily driver for work.
[23:39:58] <brentaarnold> Honestly though over the years the MX Reds have grown on me exponentially
[23:40:00] <Akuli> f843d0, ah that seems like what i want
[23:40:08] <two_dogs> mint cinnamon is nice, as hard as i try to kill it, and looks nice for a inferior gtk experience :)

[23:40:46] <Akuli> yeah it works, beautiful :D
[23:40:50] <two_dogs> TheGuestMovie, mint cinnamon, looks nice lts and user proof
[23:40:56] <f843d0> Akuli: I tried againt one terminal with a cat /dev/urandom and worked
[23:41:06] <f843d0> Akuli: s/againt/against/
[23:41:15] <msfninja> idk. ive been using flat keyboards my whole life and i think theyre perfectly fine
[23:41:17] <Akuli> now i just have to figure out how i can do that from python in a somewhat cross-posixy-platform way
[23:41:38] <knotMez> I have my keyboard on a tilt
[23:41:58] <f843d0> Akuli: easy, create a systemd service and trigger from there! :D :D :D
[23:41:58] <brentaarnold> msfninja: You probably make more on your ltitle chickley keyboard than I do on my Topre, I wouldn't worry about it too much.
[23:42:04] <brentaarnold> chicklet*
[23:42:48] <nomagno> Akuli: You want to look up how to use `ps` to find a process name, because pkill is not POSIX
[23:43:01] <brentaarnold> I'm like hey guys see my new keyboard? I can use it for all KINDS of desktop support related tasks.
[23:43:39] <Akuli> i think my approach will be to first get a list of child processes, then kill the shell (so it can't spawn more children), then kill each child (now they have ppid 1)
