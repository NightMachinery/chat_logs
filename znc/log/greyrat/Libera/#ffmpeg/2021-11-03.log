[01:39:26] *** Joins: waleee (~waleee@2001:9b0:216:8200:d457:9189:7843:1dbd)
[01:42:53] <JEEB> probably not
[01:43:02] <JEEB> which is why I like linking BtbN's since it's all in the open
[01:43:02] <JEEB> :P
[01:43:15] <emcodem> totally understandable
[01:43:16] <JEEB> getting rid of that "magical stuff" mentality
[01:43:30] <emcodem> but gyan is a valuable member of the community, right?
[01:43:50] <JEEB> I see him way less than BtbN
[01:43:59] <JEEB> he pops up on the devel mailing list, yes
[01:44:04] <emcodem> hehe i hope he is not online ;-)
[01:45:06] <emcodem> well but the build stuff not being available is a blocker for my purposes
[01:45:11] <emcodem> thanks Jan

[21:35:22] <ImBack> but one of my functions keep failing
[21:35:23] <ImBack> `av_hwframe_ctx_init`
[21:35:41] <ImBack> will always fail with an invalid parameter error
[21:35:49] <ImBack> I can't seem to figure out what the issue is
[21:35:58] <ImBack> It just seemed to stop working at random
[21:36:29] <ImBack> what should I know about this function
[21:36:44] <ImBack> I have the format, software format, width, height, and default pool size
[21:36:51] <ImBack> the format is set to CUDA pixel format
[21:36:57] <ImBack> the sw format is set to Vulkan
[21:37:02] <ImBack> the pool size default is 20
[21:37:36] <ImBack> the width and height is pretty uncertain but I'm sure it's valid
[21:38:33] <ImBack> what should precede  this function
[21:40:26] <BtbN> The CUDA hwframes ctx can't allocate vulkan frames
[21:40:32] <BtbN> it want's a software pixel format there
[21:40:38] <BtbN> like, YUV420P or NV12
[21:40:41] <BtbN> -'
[21:41:29] <BtbN> If you just want to encode with nvenc and got software frames, you also can just give it those. It handles the upload internally.
[21:42:03] <ImBack> I have my frames in the Vulkan format, so I should convert it to a SW format before I send it off to the GPU?
[21:42:32] <BtbN> I don't think Vulkan to CUDA mapping works/exists, so you'll have to, yes.
[21:42:51] <ImBack> I know CUDA can't take vulkan, but it used to be functional so I was pretty confused
[21:43:04] <ImBack> But I understand I'll try that
[21:43:25] <BtbN> Setting the swformat to Vulkan can't possibly ever have been functional. That construct makes no sense.
[21:43:39] <BtbN> There are functions to derive one hwcontext from another, to map hwframes
[21:43:45] <BtbN> But specially the Vulkan one is very wonky
[21:45:52] <ImBack> I think that earlier it may have been converted to CUDA at some point
[21:47:12] *** Joins: jrofd (~crombie@cpc127052-lewi23-2-0-cust30.2-4.cable.virginm.net)
[21:47:50] <BtbN> hwcontext_vulkan has support for transfering to and from cuda
[21:48:38] <BtbN> so if you have a vulkan hwcontext, you need to derive your cuda one from it, and then av_hwframe_transfer_data from your Vulkan to a CUDA one.
[21:49:46] <BtbN> Mapping from Vulkan to CUDA does not seem to be supported, so transfering is your only option.
[21:53:40] <ImBack> The current system involves yoinking the vulkan frame data directly from a vulkan application
[21:53:47] <ImBack> So no vulkan hardware contexts
[21:55:13] <JEEB> there is an upcoming vulkan hw decoding/encoding API extension which I think now has some bits stabilized
[21:55:23] <JEEB> problem is nvidia only has this stuff in their test driver >:|
[21:55:35] <JEEB> I have a single machine with a single GTX 1080. I don't want to run test drivers
[21:56:40] <emcodem> good evening ladies and gentlemen :-) sorry to interrupt the party, maybe someone could give me a hint on what i am doing wrong using @BtbN build scripts,
[21:57:04] <emcodem> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/qNwwkmn5/
[21:57:14] <ImBack> I can only really use ffmpeg as for a bit of context, I didn't make this software, this is a piece of Open Source software that needs NVENC support
[21:57:35] <ImBack> The reason I'm poking at it is because no one did
[21:58:19] <ImBack> So I don't have enough understanding of the application to begin re-writting the entire encoder into a brand new system
[21:58:24] <BtbN> emcodem, looks like you somehow managed to only clone parts of the repo
[21:58:26] <emcodem> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/uaM2N6sK/
[21:58:37] <BtbN> it's quite literally missing the directory with the Dockerfile in it
[21:58:41] <emcodem> oh ok, trying to start from scratch
[21:59:04] <emcodem> ./images/base/Dockerfile exists
[21:59:29] <BtbN> Also, are you running this from /? Why is it trying to create the testdir in / of the host system?
[22:00:03] <emcodem> no im in /FFmpeg-Builds_base
[22:00:13] <emcodem> yeah thats what i wondered too
[22:00:14] <BtbN> And you don't have write permissions there?
[22:00:25] <BtbN> Or rather, it's read only even
[22:00:28] <emcodem> yeah root should have

[22:01:04] <emcodem> lemme reclone in a new directory
[22:01:15] <emcodem> ubuntu 18 and most recent docker should be fine, yes?
[22:01:25] <BtbN> Ubuntu 18 is ancient, but I doubt it matters
[22:01:35] <BtbN> Why are you even putting that at /? That's a very weird path for it
[22:01:39] <emcodem> hehe i tried in 20 it was similar
[22:02:16] <emcodem> uhm i didnt specify any path anywhere
[22:02:19] <emcodem> what you mean?
[22:02:29] <BtbN> How did it end up at /?
[22:02:36] <BtbN> And not in your homedir or somewhere more sensible
[22:03:08] <emcodem> ok, so after installing linux and docker, i just did
[22:03:15] <emcodem> sudo su - (as usual hehe)

[22:03:36] <emcodem> cd /

[22:03:44] <emcodem> git clone your git url
[22:03:54] <emcodem> and after that executed the 2 commands
[22:04:17] <BtbN> Something really really messed up is going on with your system. Is the FS half dead? Why is it read only and not finding directories you say are there?
[22:04:19] <emcodem> anyway, lemme try a new checkout and su back to my user
[22:04:30] <BtbN> Just exit
[22:04:34] <emcodem> hehe no the fs is for sure fine
[22:04:41] <BtbN> Well, it says it's read only
[22:05:14] <emcodem> yeah i didnt get that too, /FFmpeg-Builds_base is just a normal folder i can write to it

[22:28:47] <ImBack> oh wait
[22:28:52] <ImBack> what am I doing
[22:28:58] <ImBack> it's already in RGB probably
[22:29:12] <BtbN> RGB is a bit peculiar though
[22:29:22] <BtbN> CUDA only supports a very specific RGB pixel format
[22:29:27] <BtbN> YUV is much easier to deal with
[22:29:41] <ImBack> NVIDIA's docs say it supports RGB on all NVENC revision
[22:30:10] <BtbN> It does, but only in 0BGR format
[22:30:24] <BtbN> so if you get something else from your stuff, you will still need swscale to convert it to that
[22:30:28] <ImBack> I says ARGB on the doc page
[22:30:35] <ImBack> https://docs.nvidia.com/video-technologies/video-codec-sdk/nvenc-application-note/
[22:31:05] <BtbN> ARGB could work
[22:31:10] <BtbN> it'll ignore the Alpha channel though
[22:31:30] <ImBack> Can a video even have an alpha layer
[22:31:45] <BtbN> some encoders support it, yeah. But it's rare
[22:32:26] <BtbN> You might have to re-label your frames as 0RGB32, before uploading to cuda
[22:33:10] <BtbN> There's also a good chance you might not want nvenc to take RGB. Cause h264/hevc with RGB in it can be a compatiblity nightmare
[22:36:45] <ImBack> Wait, can I upload an incompatible frame and convert it while it's cuda memory
[22:37:34] <ImBack> that's what scale_cuda is for/can do, right?
[22:38:15] <BtbN> Yeah, but there's not all that many formats you can upload that nvenc can't also just take as input.
[22:38:25] <BtbN> And scale_cuda can explicitly _not_ convert between RGB and YUV
[22:39:42] <ImBack> Well, looks like I have to shove all my frames into sws_scale'
[22:39:50] <ImBack> performance is for losers
[22:39:58] <BtbN> What format are they in?
[22:40:14] <BtbN> If it's ARGB, just give it a try with just directly passing it to nvenc as 0RGB.
[22:40:37] <BtbN> Color-Space stuff will be a mess then though.
[22:40:45] <BtbN> Practically impossible that it gets it right
[22:42:18] <ImBack> I guess the only way is to use sws_scale to convert into CUDA + YUV 420
[22:42:29] <ImBack> Unless there's a faster way to convert
[22:42:29] <BtbN> swscale can't "convert to CUDA"
[22:42:58] <BtbN> Just transfer your vulkan ARGB to CUDA, and tell it it's 0RGB
[22:43:25] <ImBack> Oh, so I don't need to convert hw formats?
[22:43:48] <BtbN> What?
[22:43:58] <BtbN> I think you need to read up on what hardware formats are
