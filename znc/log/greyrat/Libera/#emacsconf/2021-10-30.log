[00:28:23] <pkal> grym: bandali: That would be great, I uploaded the last render here: https://ruzkuku.com/files/emacsconf.webm
[00:29:06] <pkal> zaeph: Ah I didn't know that questions are part of the timeslot, then it is probably better because I expect there might be some discussions
[00:30:09] <grym> pkal: oo with that topic 4 minutes for q and a is probably really nice ... watching now 
[00:33:53] <zaeph> pkal: We mentioned it on the CFP, although we're enforcing it more strongly with 40-min talks.  For 10-min talks, we can usually work in some questions during our buffer-time, but that buffer-time is subject to our other requirements, so we can't guarantee it.
[00:36:24] <pkal> Oh an another thing, could I ask for the accents to be removed from my name on the schedule page. Thinking about it, it might be interpreted as a nationalist signal that wouldn't feel compfortable with.
[00:39:10] <zaeph> pkal: Sure, I'll take care of it.
[00:41:24] <zaeph> Done!

[08:10:22] <sachac> actually, I'm thinking 10 minutes is mostly presenter time
[08:10:41] <sachac> that's why we have slightly longer buffers after longer presentations
[08:11:09] <sachac> and we're going to mostly lean on quick answers and smooth transitions
[08:11:33] <sachac> but of course if people can make their presentations shorter, they can have a little more time for interaction
[08:14:37] <sachac> I'd like to have 10 well-planned, dense, interesting minutes; questions pouring in via pad and IRC; speaker preparing quick answers while the prerec is playing; a quick switch over to live view for a few answers and demos
[08:15:45] <sachac> instead of a five minute presentation that's name, title, brief intro, ask me anything, and then a scramble to answer/demo
[08:16:52] <sachac> but if it's really a 5 or 6 minute presentation and it already has an interesting takeaway, no need to dilute it:)
[08:17:36] <sachac> you can have first dibs on the extra time for Q&A, and if you don't use it, I'm sure it will come in handy elsewhere :)
[08:20:04] <sachac> pkal: ^
[08:23:30] <sachac> and there might be more time for Q&A if some talks fall through
[08:23:55] <sachac> not that I'm encouraging people to sabotage fellow speakers ;)
