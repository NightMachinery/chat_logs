[00:56:49] <somiaj> JordiGH: Unsure why it hasn't been fixed yet, seems there is an upstream commit for the 2.3 branch in bullseye. Could be some conflict with debian patches make it hard to apply the fix or some other issue. Unfourntally the security team is kinda poor at communicating current progress so nothing to do except wait (unless you want to build your own package)
[00:57:15] <JordiGH> Maybe I'll go ask in #debian-devel in OFTC

[00:57:53] <JordiGH> IN FACT I WILL
[00:57:54] <somiaj> the patch itself is actually quite complicated, and adds a new file to the source

[00:58:38] <somiaj> so maybe there is something around that, it isn't just hey fix this code, it is add this new file, so testing it all builds inside of debian stable can take a bit (wild guess)

[01:00:01] <JordiGH> This says, use anything but stable!
[01:00:08] <somiaj> so could be any number of issues. Maybe they are testing it, maybe it doesn't port over well to other arches, maybe it conflicts with debian patches some way....

[03:26:15] <tcurdt-> my systemd skills are still weak ... I am trying to run a service like this https://gist.github.com/tcurdt/b1c61ad5eab809034a1db4a4df3df217 but it seems like it does not have access to it's home dir (!?) ... works fine when I run it from the shell as the user ... I am a little puzzled and could use some pointers
[03:26:29] *** Joins: System_Error (~SystemErr@user/systemerror)
[03:26:34] <lembron> "ProtectHome=true"...
[03:27:07] <tcurdt-> but that should still give access to the users home dir AFAIK ... especially as it's outside of /home
[03:27:23] <lembron> that be ProtectHome=read-only or not?
[03:27:40] <tcurdt-> that's not how I read the man
[03:27:45] <Khepra> systemd.exec(5) for more info
[03:27:57] <lembron> (i dont have any actual clue, just remember needing that for munin :D)
[03:28:36] <Khepra> "If true, the dirs /home [...] are made INACCESSIBLE and empty for processes invoked by this unit"  emphasis mine
[03:28:57] <Khepra> so perhaps you want read-only
[03:29:03] <tcurdt-> but the home dir is not in /home
[03:29:42] <Khepra> maybe it's actually looking up running user's $HOME and the manpage is not being precise about that
[03:29:59] <Khepra> tcurdt-: what's teh actual end goal you want to achieve here?
[03:30:37] <tcurdt-> well, I just want to run the service and took the systemd config from contrib and though I give it a go - and maybe learn something new :)
[03:30:57] <tcurdt-> new used those protect thingys before
[03:31:09] <Khepra> the service unit directives are aplenty and powerful. you need to understand them to use them properly.
[03:31:51] <Khepra> question is also, why do you want to protect /home at all. you should be running services as dedicated users and your /home/ dirs should be 750 or stronger.
[03:32:25] <Khepra> unfortunately on debian they're not by default, so among first hardening steps is changing that umask default

[03:33:17] <tcurdt-> TBH ... I just took the config and my eyes glazed over ... maybe I have a look at a debian service for reference instead
[03:33:18] <Khepra> if however you want to block access to specific paths using namespacing only, there's ReadWritePaths, ReadOnlyPaths and InacessiblePaths,   all doc'd in systemd.exec(5)
[03:34:12] <Khepra> tcurdt-: so you randomly copypasted something you don't quite understand what it does. gotcha :)
[03:34:28] <tcurdt-> well, not quite :)
[03:35:08] <tcurdt-> I found it in contrib, read through a few man pages and thought I give it a try to understand what it does

[03:35:20] <tcurdt-> but yeah - it's c&p :)
[03:36:00] <Khepra> ProtectHome makes little sense, unless you don't want to change the /home/ dirs defaults, but that's terrible approach.
[03:36:36] <Khepra> hardnening should start with discretionary (aka "unix") permissions. then you follow that with service security options, namespacing,  and preferrably with a MAC policy, AppArmor for example.
[03:38:34] <Khepra> tcurdt-: also, I don't know what that service does, but make sure you check if that ProtectSystem=strict is acceptable without ReadWritePaths override.
[03:42:28] <tcurdt-> this seems like good read https://ruderich.org/simon/notes/systemd-service-hardening
[03:42:52] <tcurdt-> I think the hardening is a bit over the top for service running on a local network :)
[03:43:08] <Khepra> at a glance, it explains less than the .exec manpage
[03:43:21] <Khepra> tcurdt-: google's advice is to treat LAN as hostile.
[03:44:07] <Khepra> it makes a point. an infected... windows.... PC becomes a threat actor and elevates your "trusted" network into a highly hostile one.
[03:44:32] <Khepra> few probes later, some smbv1.0 leftovers becasue "meh, it's just home network" and poof you're pwnt.
[03:45:51] <Khepra> then  your DNS is hijacked because the router is still admin:admin, because "meh it's just home network" :)   and before you know it, your banking is sniffed, your banking 2FA intercepted and you're asking yourself where's that vacation money you've been saving through whole 2021.

[03:47:43] <tcurdt-> it seems quite a few things have to happen for that :) but I know what you want to say
[03:48:15] <Khepra> it all starts with that cousin who's visiting and who asked for the wifi password for his laptop :)
[03:48:22] <tcurdt-> hehehe
[03:48:41] <tcurdt-> sounds like a story :-D
[03:48:45] <tcurdt-> where I still don't have a good solution is https on the local network
[03:49:24] <tcurdt-> self signed sucks ... letsencrypt for the local network isn't really feasible
[03:49:48] <Khepra> self signed is not bad at all, if the client software can peg down the signature
[03:50:27] <Khepra> for example, thunderbird used to have the option where it'd complain but remember the signature and if that changed, it'd alert you as if it was a normally signed cert.
[03:50:46] <Khepra> I think firefox can do the similar overrides. just don't use HSTS or then it won't allow the override.
[03:50:46] <tcurdt-> the browser experience isn't great ... I remember using self-sign client cert for auth ... it was good and painful at the same time

[12:32:57] <antto> blame M$, but maybe also.. is the HDD dying?
[12:33:23] <Kerr> No, it's a 4tb 970 evo that also has my debian partition on it
[12:33:29] <budlight> is the smart failing on it
[12:33:47] <Kerr> which is why ~2mibps is shockingly slow

[12:34:57] <antto> but iirc i think some stuff related to NTFS changed between 10 and 11
[12:35:46] <antto> support for dealing (particularly writing to) NTFS was sketchy in debian 10
[12:35:50] <jelly> Kerr, is the destiantion device slow?  run "iostat -mx 5" and pastebin output.  Are you using something like rsync -P to copy, to see progress and current speed?
[12:36:09] <jelly> also, is the source device slow?
[12:36:15] <sussudio> Kerr: check your logs for errors.
[12:36:48] <antto> tilt the PC backwards so that the gravity helps the data flow faster into the device ;P~
[12:36:50] <Kerr> I've noticed slowness between two different SSD's. one a 970 evo, one and 860. only involving ntfs partitions
[12:37:26] <budlight> dual boot
[12:37:34] <Kerr> on windows the ntfs partitions function correctly with several hundred mib/s.
[12:37:37] <jelly> Kerr, also pastebin the output of "mount"

[12:45:53] <jelly> you seem to have "sync" mount point on those.  That would make writes really slow, and would possibly create lots of tiny write() requests
[12:45:54] <Kerr> it looks like it's fast when they are the source, but ridiculously slow as destination
[12:47:19] <jelly> Kerr, can you do "mount -o remount,async /arcslash", verify the "sync" option is gone from mount output, then try using that one as dest?

[14:25:16] <GoodCrossing> Hi, I have a Raspbian install which stopped booting yesterday. I have plugged it into a monitor and most services start up until systemd logs 'Reached target Login Prompt' and nothing else happens; keyboard input is ignored unless it's something like a SysRq. It responds to pings but it refuses any incoming connections. I can't find anything on the logs; but they don't even seem to reach the same 'login prompt' line that I see on the
[14:25:17] <GoodCrossing> screen.
[14:25:26] <GoodCrossing> Any ideas?

[14:28:32] <dpkg> Raspberry Pi OS (previously called Raspbian) is a distribution <based on Debian> made specifically for the <Raspberry Pi>.  Raspbian is not Debian and it is not supported in #debian.  Please use #raspbian (or #raspberrypi) on irc.libera.chat for support.   https://www.raspbian.org/
[14:29:52] <Khepra> if this were debian, I'd ask if there are any weird cmdline options, especially relating to systemd targets, and I'd try forcing systemd.unit=multi-user.target
[14:30:07] <Khepra> but since it's not...   :)
[14:30:10] <GoodCrossing> Yeah, I'll ask there. I was just wondering if there might be something I could do from the rescue shell that'd be the same as debian.
[14:30:25] <GoodCrossing> Ah, well... I'll see if that might translate into Raspbian :)

[14:31:36] <Khepra> sysrq responding, ping responding, means the kernel isn't in a panic mode, didn't hang up. could be misconfigured target so no (important) services are starting.
[14:31:40] <antto> the WHOLE THING is weird
[14:32:30] <antto> maybe your login manager corrupted on the SD Card

[14:32:52] <joze> with the key exchange
[14:33:01] <Khepra> joze: very much so, including pinning the key with teh specific repo so it doesn't pose a threat to others
[14:33:37] <GoodCrossing> that is possible... there has to be some sort of corruption, what happened is the Pi froze as it went OOM (I believe at least) and I had to unplug it and plug it back in as there wasn't a way to gratefully shut down.

[14:34:34] <Khepra> GoodCrossing: if you could get that kernel ring buffer out somehow, via serial perhaps, you'd have direct view into what's happening, but I don't know rasp(bian|berrypi) enoug to suggest how to do it
[14:35:40] <antto> i'd think the intended way to fix this is to.. toss it and buy a new one ;P~
[14:36:44] <Khepra> can you plug an usb stick, boot into some live env, build a VM that uses the sd card as "virtual" disk, and boot it?  that's what we do with servers to diagnos boot issues without KVM (keyboard-video-mouse) apparatus
[14:36:55] <GoodCrossing> I can run dmesg in the rescue shell but it shows the output from the rescue shell boot, and the error occurs afterwards. Any way to get the dmesg output from the previous boot?

[15:25:01] <GoodCrossing> logs don't have any useful things... dmesg last outputs 'Link is down' for the ethernet interface, and something similar for syslog. When the pi boots, the boot messages actually show more things after where the logs seem to stop. Where are those? It might have something to do with the fact that in between any reboot dmesg shows a random amount of '^@' characters.
[15:25:45] <GoodCrossing> I have 'narrowed it down' (not much) to something loading for multi-user.target

[19:35:56] <Khepra> ajcc: there have been a number of firmware fixes for various amdgpu models, since what's packaged in debian. maybe, jsut a test, try the contents of /lib/firmware/amdgpu taken from kernel.org's firmware tarball

[19:37:02] <Khepra> I've had numerous glitches fixed when I !ssb'ed mesa from sid to stable. Now I have new ones which I see are fixed with even more recent versions of mesa and now I have to rebuild that, but now sid's mesa is no longer backportable without moar patchjes, and I'm about to flip the table and drop debian from desktop :)
