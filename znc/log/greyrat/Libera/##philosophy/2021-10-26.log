[01:45:19] <causative> I'm always skeptical of "literary value" or "artistic value" - it's always so vague.  People never can say what, specifically, they learned from an artistic work.  What I think they get out of it is mostly the status symbol of being able to say they consumed the work.
[01:45:45] <Player001> literature can help to make you not an insufferable prick
[01:52:40] <causative> if you take a course on literature what they teach you is mostly about hidden symbolism in the text.  My question is, why doesn't the author just come out and say what he had to say directly?  Why hide everything in a riddle?
[01:52:54] <Player001> you are a troll
[01:53:13] <causative> I'm in favor of clear and direct declarative statements
[01:54:18] <causative> hiding everything in a riddle of hidden symbolism is just obscurantism:  if you understand the riddle, now it's "hidden knowledge" that you get to feel special about and better than those who did not see that symbolism

[02:08:14] <Player001> <causative> DPA, Kant's categorical imperative stuff is not really sensible
[02:08:14] <Player001> <causative> he says we should act by whatever maxim we could will to be a universal law - but he fails to describe what counts as a "maxim" or what are permissible or non-permissible ways to universalize it
[02:09:10] <Player001> I really would like to know where you got your information on Kant from
[02:09:16] <Player001> Bertrand Russell?
[02:11:06] <causative> books and articles about him, e.g. SEP
[02:11:54] <causative> the problem with the categorical imperative is, suppose a guy named David Lieber Strauss wants to steal a TV.  So he acts by the maxim: "David Lieber Strauss should steal whatever TVs he wants." Is this a permissible maxim?  Why or why not?
[02:12:25] <causative> and is it universalizable?  If *everyone* in the world followed this maxim, it would change *only his* behavior, because no one else is named David Lieber Strauss
[02:12:50] <Player001> ah, this is why you need to read Kant
[02:12:51] <causative> i.e. if someone named Mary Lou Higgins followed the maxim "David Lieber Strauss should steal whatever TVS he wants," her behavior would not change
[02:13:23] <causative> so we may wish to say that this is not a maxim, or not the right way to universalize it, because it names David specifically
[02:13:31] <causative> but David need not use his *name* in the maxim
[02:14:13] <causative> he may be born on July 12, 1976, and have a gray poodle.  So then the maxim might be, "Those born on July 12, 1976 who own a gray poodle may steal whatever TVs they like."
[02:14:37] <causative> the next objection one might make is that this adds too many conditions to stealing TVs
[02:15:05] <causative> but even "Do not steal" is a maxim that includes many implicit conditions - because "stealing" is a complex social construct.  Taking an item will be stealing in some situations and not others.
[02:15:13] <causative> so we cannot get away from including many implicit conditions in the maxims
[02:15:30] <causative> So by what method can we rule out David using the categorical imperative to justify stealing a TV?
[02:16:57] <Player001> does David aim at the good when he steals the TV?
[02:17:12] <causative> isn't the categorical imperative supposed to be the thing that tells him what is good?
[02:19:11] <causative> I would say no, he does not aim at the good - but that the categorical imperative cannot tell us this.

[02:24:32] <Player001> the categorical imperative is a demand of reason on each and every rational subject
[02:25:54] <Player001> the correct formulation is "I should steal TVs"
[02:26:07] <Player001> which not good because we're treating the TV-makers as means and not ends
[02:26:20] <causative> the whole question is, what makes that the correct formulation, rather than "David Lieber Strauss should steal TVs"?
[02:26:32] <causative> what makes the latter formulation incorrect?
[02:26:59] <Player001> David is treating the TV-makers as means and not ends-in-themselves
[02:27:24] <causative> well, now you're invoking something other than the CI
[02:29:29] <causative> "Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."
[02:29:38] <Player001> plus "I" also refers to the noumenal subject while David refers to the phenomenal subject so they are not equivalent
[02:30:13] <causative> very well, they are not equivalent. And so?
[02:30:15] <Player001> and every "I" is the same qua rational subject

[02:39:50] <causative> I don't see how the conclusion follows from your premises
[02:40:04] <causative> what about the premises makes applying the CI as David wants to, forbidden?
[02:42:57] <causative> here's another way David could formulate his maxim:  "I should grubnigate."  Where "grubnigate" is defined as "stealing a TV whenever you want, if your name is David Lieber Strauss, and not stealing TVs otherwise."
[02:43:14] <causative> now he does use the pronoun "I"; and he still would have no objection to everyone following the maxim
[02:46:02] <Player001> I mean. despite the fact that the categorical imperative applies unconditionally, there are other reasons
[02:46:14] <causative> let's get reason #1 down first
[02:46:32] <Player001> the if is conditional
[02:46:37] <causative> <causative> the next objection one might make is that this adds too many conditions to stealing TVs
[02:46:37] <causative> <causative> but even "Do not steal" is a maxim that includes many implicit conditions - because "stealing" is a complex social construct.  Taking an item will be stealing in some situations and not others.
[02:47:11] <causative> "stealing" is "taking an item, IF the item does not belong to you, and belongs to someone else, and the legal system does not grant you a right to take it."

[02:48:34] <causative> because "steal" is conditional
[02:48:51] <causative> and do you have a rebuttal to that? some way in which "steal" is not conditional but "grubnigate" is?
[02:48:53] <Player001> I don't consider this a valid argument and am moving on

[02:49:07] <causative> *why* don't you consider it a valid argument?

[02:49:59] <Player001> so David's trick does not work because he does not aim at the good

[02:50:39] <causative> then what is "the good"? is that not what the CI was supposed to determine?
[02:51:05] <causative> and if you have some notion of "the good" that is not based in the CI, but that the CI depends on, then the CI itself seems unnecessasry
[02:51:13] <Player001> listen causative, I think you should realize I don't owe you anything am am doing you a favor by explaining all this to you

[02:54:15] <causative> if you're about to tell me about how Kant says we should treat others as ends in themselves, but not as means to an end, and that this is the good, I've heard it before and it is a *different* theory of good than the CI; if you say the CI depends on this other theory, which already defines the good, then what do we need the CI for?
[02:56:00] <causative> (and I also have some issues with that other theory of the good, but that's a separate point)
[02:56:47] <Player001> these are all parts of Kant's ethical framework so not really separate
[02:57:17] <Player001> our reason for acting on the categorical imperative is to achieve the good
[02:57:53] <Player001> so really integral
[02:58:01] <causative> so which do you say came first and justifies the other:  the CI, or using others as ends in themselves?
[02:58:40] <Player001> you don't use people as ends-in-themselves, you treat them as ends-in-themselves
[02:58:56] <causative> very well, answer the question with that substitution
[03:01:28] <Player001> categorical imperative
[03:02:21] <Player001> especially since "I should treat others as ends-in-themselves and not mere means" is a categorical imperative and the duty of every rational subject
[03:04:09] <causative> then if the CI came first, you cannot use the objection that David isn't treating others as an end-in-themselves, as a way to reject his maxim
[03:04:24] <causative> that follows the CI, it isn't part of it
[03:04:24] <Player001> he doesn't aim at the good
[03:04:46] <causative> and what is the good, if not what the CI says it is?
[03:05:14] <Player001> his maxim to steal the TV is motivated by his base desire and does not aim at the good
[03:05:32] <causative> you said that already, and I give the same resposne
[03:06:05] <Player001> what was the response
[03:06:12] <causative> <causative> and what is the good, if not what the CI says it is?
[03:07:27] <causative> afk
[03:10:00] <Player001> the categorical imperative is a demand on our actions, the good is something we are concerned with achieving as rational beings

[03:37:32] <biys> long ago
[03:38:04] <I_Am_M00t> oh
[03:38:05] <I_Am_M00t> rite
[03:38:08] <I_Am_M00t> so y u complaining
[03:38:14] <biys> complaining about what?
[03:38:41] <I_Am_M00t> mandatory vaccines, wearing masks etc
[03:38:54] <biys> i was complaining about that?
[03:39:04] <biys> oooh.  you're talking about the conversation from a couple weeks ago
[03:39:15] <I_Am_M00t> :D LOL
[03:39:28] <biys> you said you didn't take the time to read it
[03:39:30] <biys> as it was too lengthy
[03:39:34] <biys> and "no one has time for that"
[03:39:41] <I_Am_M00t> lmao :D
[03:39:48] <I_Am_M00t> well i can pick up keywords
[03:39:55] <I_Am_M00t> i can't make sense of the structure of the argument
[03:40:12] <Tintle> vaccines must never be mandatory.
[03:40:30] <I_Am_M00t> well they've been mandatory for a long time
[03:40:32] <biys> i said i was steel manning the anti-vax narrative

[03:41:08] <random-jellyfish> imagine if the smallpox vaxx was never mandatory...the fun we'd be having right now
[03:42:02] <biys> well...  evolution isn't really a matter of meking things better as much as it is making compromises
[03:42:11] <biys> i said it before and i'll say it again.  the vaccine is dysgenic
[03:42:22] <biys> but we've already been significantly dysgenic enough as a species
[03:42:26] <biys> so we might as well keep going
[03:42:37] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[03:42:50] <I_Am_M00t> having a society is also dysgenic, by that logic
[03:42:58] <I_Am_M00t> any technology is dysgenic
[03:43:12] <I_Am_M00t> fire is dysgenic! it makes it too easy to eat, anyone can survive!
[03:43:22] <biys> sure.  it becomes a question of if it's organic or not
[03:43:28] <biys> it'
[03:43:49] <I_Am_M00t> lol, my point is, the dysgenic argument is very ... strange/weak, unless you're willing to let go of any technology, strategy, organization
[03:44:04] <random-jellyfish> how are vaccines dysgenic?
[03:44:05] <biys> it's like this.  change is necessary.  change should happen.  whether that change is organic or not and represents the ideas held by the population is another thing
[03:44:29] <I_Am_M00t> anyway, whether or not dysgenic, it's a moot point :>
[03:44:32] <I_Am_M00t> it's not central
[03:44:40] <biys> vs. for example. manufacturerd concent.
[03:44:44] <biys> IE. fear mongering
[03:45:39] <biys> random-jellyfish: well... remember last summer when Texas had that big freeze?
[03:45:51] <biys> and their power grid wasn't able to handle it cause they never expected something liket hat being able to happen?
[03:46:18] <random-jellyfish> okay, continue
[03:46:20] <biys> well it also happened that a bunch of sea turtles as a result were going to die.  so there was an effort put forward in which a bunch of people ended up saving "thousands" of sea turtles
[03:46:43] <biys> it very well could be that the death of those sea turtles could have been a significant net positive for the ecosystem
[03:46:46] <biys> as a result of their death
[03:47:03] <biys> we aren't entirely aware of the effects "saving" those turtles had or will have in the future
[03:47:12] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[03:47:21] <I_Am_M00t> biys: plz don't hate on turtles
[03:47:29] <I_Am_M00t> plz i get ur point, but plz, not turtles
[03:47:33] <biys> it's like the wildebeest in africa.  every now and again during their migration there is a significant slaughter as a result of some kind of environmental situation
[03:47:35] <random-jellyfish> aren't we above the ecosystem? since we have the means to save ourselves from a lot of dangers?
[03:47:41] <biys> liek large amounts of them run off a cliff or something
[03:47:45] <biys> or large amounts of them drown
[03:47:54] <biys> this might seem like a "bad" thing... the amount of death
[03:48:02] <biys> but the effects it has on the ecosystem is actualyl pretty significant
[03:48:05] <random-jellyfish> if we want to apply evolution at the human level we should apply it to memes not genes
[03:48:26] <biys> i would say we rely on the planet
[03:48:34] <biys> i would say we are not "above" the ecossytem
[03:49:09] <random-jellyfish> we are endowed with intellect and morality
[03:49:28] <random-jellyfish> we can't just abandon these traits for the sake of the ecosystem
[03:49:40] <biys> i never said abandon the traits
[03:51:03] <biys> next you'll be telling me about the revolutionary phenotype
[03:51:08] <random-jellyfish> well, letting people die is a way of abandoning them
[03:51:21] <biys> and genetic modification should be full go
[03:51:25] <biys> whilst complaining about eugenics
[03:51:26] * biys laughs
[03:54:33] <causative> genetic modification is our only hope to remain relevant in the coming age of billionaires and robots
[03:55:16] <biys> oh for sure
[03:55:17] <causative> we'll probably end up smaller than we are now, so we consume fewer resources and are thus more cost-competitive with a robot
[03:55:35] <causative> maybe job-specific specializations
[03:55:47] <causative> possibly we could find a way to augment our intelligence dramatically
[03:55:58] <biys> genetic traits associated with IQ will likely need to be worked
[03:56:03] <biys> to prevent low IQ peopel from existing
[03:56:36] <biys> i remember prior to covid they were talking about automating the trucking industry
[03:56:45] <causative> that depends on whether there will still be a need for stocking clerks and such
[03:56:47] <biys> now one of the largest shortages we have is supply chain drivers
[03:56:47] <random-jellyfish> mRNA can be used to create stem cells, which can then become neurons
[03:57:21] <biys> causative: well... the menial tasks will be automated to increase the amount of free time
[03:57:29] <causative> or if the robots will be good enough that a human stocking clerk would not be cost-competitive, even if they were genetically engineered to be better at it

In a certain sense, meaning is the intended or approved function of a component within a system. Can we apply this to the meaning of words or propositions?

[09:08:14] <wodemoncafe> I'm sick of certain people accusing each other of being "in the illusion" or "not getting it", in the field of philosophy (In general, not specific to this channel), as if nobody *has* to abide by the social structures and cultures we live in. Just because you understand what "it" is all about, that doesn't imply that you begin living as a hermit in a cabin in the woods, or join a monastery for a life of meditation and reflection. Yes, many of us
[09:08:15] <wodemoncafe> get it, we humans are all the same at the essence, and yet we are ourselves, our personalities, our characteristics, the world around us, is an illusion. That doesn't mean we unceremoniously abandon our families, friends, jobs, and lives. "Getting it", as they say, is not about shedding your corporeal form and becoming a pseudo-intellectual grand master of pigeon chess, sitting on an altar of ego and preaching about what "you" believe, and what "you"
[09:08:16] <wodemoncafe>  think is right. Well who are "you"? This entity sitting on the altar *is* your ego. If you really get it, you wouldn't need to be on that altar, playing pigeon chess. People are what they are, people do what they do. If you really get it, you go on with your life and ponder "Well, now what do I do with 'it'?" as you continue about your business. I can read a page on quantum physics a hundred times, memorize it verbatim, and disseminate the ideas
[09:08:18] <wodemoncafe> contained within. That does not imply I understand them. Knowledge and understanding are not the same. It would be great if we armchair philosophers ceased this one-upmanship about who is "more" enlightened. If you think this a metric by which we can be measured, you are headed in the wrong direction. The universe will be what it will be, and we can't really control our thoughts and feelings in the traditional sense of the idea, because what we
[09:08:19] <wodemoncafe> think of as the self is the amalgamation of those thoughts and ideas. Sure, they may change over time, but that is not something one can "do", as if one were to flip a light switch. We can plant the seed of an idea within ourselves, and with care and nourishment, perhaps one day that seed will grow and begin to bear the fruits of change.

[23:47:40] <ro-bot-o> [url] Overcoming Bias : What Makes Stuff Rot? | www.overcomingbias.com
[23:48:05] <mnemon> I'm not sure if excessive "freedom" helps against that in any way as such
[23:48:35] <mnemon> maybe in the sense that people might feel more inclined to complain and reveal the corruption
[23:48:50] <causative> yes, perhaps we could achieve a better-functioning society by accepting more limitations on our behaviors and less freedom - but the problem is, even if these limitations were well-intentioned to begin with, over time Pournell's law will take effect, and the government or business powers will be co-opted by those who just are in it for the power
[23:48:54] <ldlework> mnemon: if freedom is defined as whatever doesn't aggress, then what cause for complaint do peaceful neighbors have against armed neighbors
[23:50:08] <causative> "freedom" is the power of the individual to do what he wants
[23:50:18] <ldlework> assuming they don't aggress
[23:50:23] <mnemon> ldlework: problem is that this kind of situation might lead to massive aggression if allowed to develop
[23:50:25] <causative> this naturally opposes the power of corrupt institutions
[23:50:36] <ldlework> mnemon: so?
[23:50:58] <ldlework> maybe it is more optimal game theoretic strategy for the peaceful neighbors to be well armed too?
[23:51:12] <ldlework> rather than them complain and try to curtail the actions of others, who haven't aggressed?

[23:52:08] <causative> the gun rights issue is one of the ways the rich keep us squabbling with each other instead of focusing on class struggle
[23:52:47] <causative> it's non-threatening to them, whether the average person has a gun or not, and it gives us a distraction, so they like to focus on it
[23:53:00] <ldlework> i think the reason squabbling happens is because positions are so polarized on the issue
[23:53:18] <causative> they're polarized by design of the media establishment, to keep us from thinking about class struggle
[23:53:21] <ldlework> and mnemon's hypothetical applies to nations and other structures of various size too
[23:53:33] <causative> the freedoms that matter are freedoms that could actually let us organize and fight for our rights against the haves, e.g. unionizing
[23:53:50] <causative> and taking money out of politics
[23:53:50] <ldlework> the media may utilize the polarity, but it doesn't drive it. the differences in positions do.
[23:54:00] <mnemon> ldlework: sure, it's a good plan when you have cannibal mutant raider neibhours. Maybe a better one would be to create a larger union or federation to handle the defence/enforcement so you don't have to try to match the power of a group that is focused on warfare capabilities
[23:54:06] <ldlework> if there were no media, then people would still not agree on the issue
[23:54:23] <causative> they would still not agree but they wouldn't get so riled up about it
[23:54:36] <ldlework> mnemon: the point is, you have no complaint about what other people do until they actually do something bad
[23:54:41] <causative> and they might get more riled up about the things that actually do affect their lives, like labor rights and money in politics
[23:54:50] <mnemon> but those tend to lead to other rules and regulations to reduce potential for aggression and so on and so forth
[23:55:08] <ldlework> i dunno, whether you can use technology to defend your life will probably always be a central issue in human affairs

[23:57:17] <causative> the police and military establishments are strong enough to put down any kind of action of that sort
