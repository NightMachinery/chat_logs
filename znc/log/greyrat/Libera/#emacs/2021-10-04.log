[05:51:34] <aidalgol> wtf is QUIC?
[05:53:50] <williewillus> alternate transport protocol built on top of udp
[05:54:19] <twb> aidalgol: QUIC is a replacement for TCP written on top of UDP, optimized for google
[05:54:20] <aidalgol> It feels like Layer 7 is taking on more and more work.
[05:54:28] <twb> QUIC is l3
[05:54:28] <aidalgol> Is this a good idea?
[05:54:42] <aidalgol> twb: Er... how can it be if UDP is layer 6?
[05:54:57] <williewillus> it isn't?
[05:55:16] <aidalgol> Ugh, I always get layers 4-6 muddled.
[05:55:26] <twb> aidalgol: sigh
[05:55:31] <williewillus> quic basically just uses udp as a dumb pipe, quic itself is pretty much a transport layer. I guess the big thing is it's implemented in user space
[05:55:35] <twb> aidalgol: OK so ignoring that TCP/IP doesn't map to layers cleanly
[05:55:46] <twb> aidalgol: l1 = electrons, e.g. 802.3
[05:55:46] <williewillus> which they say will prevent things from ossifying in lower layers
[05:55:48] <aidalgol> 5 and 6 are-- yes, that's what I was going to bring up.
[05:56:04] <aidalgol> williewillus: ossifying?
[05:56:06] <twb> aidalgol: l2 = IP; l3 = TCP; l7 = http
[05:56:11] <williewillus> ossifying = hard to change
[05:56:15] <twb> l8 = fucking users
[05:56:36] <twb> Oops I derped a bit.  l2 is switch fabric
[05:56:39] <aidalgol> twb: I think you're off by one.  l2 would be the ethernet frames
[05:56:43] <twb> so OK I don't remmber this either

[08:09:35] <rnkn> Spawns_Carpeting: the italic regexp will essentially match both, but I'd like the comment font locking to override all other font lock props
[08:10:14] <rnkn> e.g. font lock keywords can have an OVERRIDE flag, but the italic keywords already need to to be 'append

[10:43:14] <gabin> as the command passes in the selected region's start and end integers,

[11:41:57] <twb> Also this is not using systemd's docker/lxc replacement at all, which is why it's using the regular rootfs
[11:42:39] <twb> If you say "hey systemd here's a tarball of a filesystem, make it into a container" then it does a whole different bag of stuff, but that is also not rootless

[21:50:47] <Catie> Lisp Machine Lisp was where a lot of the really particularly Common Lisp-ish features came from, notably quasiquoting and complex lambda-lists
[21:50:49] <pjb> I don't think RMS was influencial on CL, given that he was working on early GNU emacs at that time.
[21:51:07] <bremner> scheme has quasiquoting also...

[21:51:27] <Catie> When did Scheme get quasiquoting? My understanding is that it was introduced in Lisp Machine Lisp
[21:51:33] <parsnip> yeah so i guess some parts of elisp are more like scheme than cl
[21:51:37] <parsnip> so i hear
[21:51:40] <pjb> If only RMS could have started working on GNU emacs 2 or 3 years later…   With several CL implementations on unix boxes, he could have choosen to use it instead of writing emacs lisp.
