[01:12:52] <sney> bullseye is no longer testing
[01:13:12] <sney> removing the sid source after installing the package is the safest route

[12:19:12] <SymbioticFemale> kewl
[12:19:24] <SymbioticFemale> thanks. i'll take it from here.
[12:19:35] <PMT> There are various more powerful options, and you might wind up needing to boot into the install in the VM to install firmware-misc-nonfree and friends if you're going to need them on the host, but
[12:19:40] <PMT> that would be where i'd start.
[12:22:07] <KatrinValerie> mbr boot in this day and age? are there valid reasons to do that still?

[14:13:30] <PMT> They do, yes. Not a physical button, as far as I know, but in the web UI there's usually at least the button when configuring the WAN to set the MAC to something else, sometimes to steal the MAC of what it thinks you're connecting from.
[14:13:37] <jelly> cadmio, did you investigate how macchanger integrates with ifupdown, instead?
[14:14:06] <pasiz> but yes, even on my home network if known mac is spoofed and device fingerprint is different than original, device is banned completely

[14:31:26] <cadmio> that's a pity

[14:33:19] <jelly> > that script seems to only call macchanger with -e, and I see no way to write a config file for macchanger with maps of interface -> newmac or old mac -> new mac
[14:34:21] <cadmio> it doesn't make sense to have macchanger do nothing
[14:34:27] <jelly> the simplest thing to do might be to  replace "hwaddress ether ma:cc:ad:re:ss" with "pre-up macchanger -m ma:cc:ad:re:ss wlfkdshfkjf"
[14:36:05] <jelly> cadmio, macchanger does intrusive things with your network config, if you analyze the script you'll see it has a config file, and if you read the config file you'll see the script is disabled by default.  
[14:37:00] <jelly> Debian does not enable services by default if there's no safe way to do it.  So this integration is disabled with the setting in /etc/default/macchanger.

[22:20:25] <scottpedia> okie dokie
[22:20:45] <n4dir> funny enough quite some web-results claim it would be "user" and "live". That sure is always a mess (live isos and credentials)
[22:21:36] <bittin_> n4dir: yeah thats what i found when i googled
[22:21:46] <n4dir> scottpedia: though i found one result which claims you can add an "option" during grub, then set them after boot. Should have linked it, now i closed the tab

[22:25:36] <scottpedia> perhabs I will try that one if I don't get any answer from #debian-live
[22:25:45] <n4dir> ah, good then. Still foam at mouth from the mess live isos create in such regard. 
[22:26:28] * scottpedia giggles
[22:26:52] <n4dir> say you could give the info via "moto". 
[22:27:00] <n4dir> and i think some even do that. not sure
[22:27:42] <scottpedia> i did not get that
[22:28:17] <n4dir> you boot, and automatically get that info. However that is possible, but it shouldn't be too hard
[22:29:07] <scottpedia> are you seggusting a potential feature for debian live?
[22:29:20] <scottpedia> sure that would be the best
[22:29:34] <scottpedia> but it's not implemented obviously at the moment
[22:29:41] <n4dir> it is easily 10 years ago, but i don't remember them being outstanding open for suggestions. I meant in general though, for any live image
[22:30:19] <n4dir> it was quite a thing when debian offered their first live image. Big hooray all over the forum :-)
[22:32:43] <n4dir> i had quite some fun with it, mainly creating your own live isos or just snapshotting the already installed debian. Me being me i forgot all the details, and could say nothing about it anymore. Voodoo
[22:34:54] <scottpedia> I would in the future make such an image for myself 
[22:35:18] <scottpedia> with cryptsetup, lvm, tor...
[22:35:39] <n4dir> sure is fun. And anyone can get his head in it. Not exactly intuitive, but sure doable
[22:35:43] <scottpedia> getting rid of the evil MS windows and macos
[22:36:44] <n4dir> after debian-build (i think debian-live was renamed to that?) removed the option to just make a snapshot of an installed debian, i used refractasnapshot (not debian package) to do that. Easy as pie
[22:37:19] <n4dir> install, install what is needed, configure, run refractasnapshot, wait. Done
[22:37:45] <n4dir> boot it, look for what you forgot. Do it again. :-)

[23:36:07] <scottpedia> Does debian touch the disks other than the one that you select as the root?
[23:36:24] <scottpedia> because the table includes them
[23:36:30] <sney> the installer only modifies the disks that you tell it to modify
