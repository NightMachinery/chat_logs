[00:00:28] <kodah> mikoto-chan: there are other fileserver implementations that'll do that i think
[00:00:50] <kodah> the base doesn't afaik, it's mainly for serving static assets from what i can tell, not for selectively listing assets
[00:01:23] <ikke> It's not a high-level webserver with all kinds of config options
[00:01:54] <mikoto-chan> examples of what else I can use?
[00:02:03] <mikoto-chan> building your own thing can be dangerous I rea
[00:02:04] <mikoto-chan> d
[00:02:18] <kodah> i want to say gin has one you might like
[00:02:28] <kodah> but that is not a pure go implementation iirc
[00:03:03] <ikke> what is 'dangerous' is if you implement custom directory traversel
[00:04:40] <ikke> If you enumerate what files are available in a directory, and just allow those to be selected, then you avoid that
[00:05:43] <mikoto-chan> ikke: that's another problem I have to deal with, the files change all the time and whitelisting them seems to be too much of a pain
[00:06:13] <ikke> You can just scan the directory for each request to determine what files are there
[00:07:06] <ikke> for a basic implementation, that works good enough
[00:09:25] <mikoto-chan> so writing my own function it is then?
[00:10:04] <ikke> Maybe there is some module / package that does this already, but I don't know of any myself
[00:11:03] <mikoto-chan> does the Handler for "/" also deal with "/books/"?
[00:11:41] <ikke> I linked you to the section in the documentation about that, the other day
[00:12:33] <mikoto-chan> sorry, since it was raining I had my electricity safety thing went off, my PC suddenly shutdown and all my tabs went missing ://
[00:12:45] <mikoto-chan> s/went/go/
[00:12:49] <ikke> https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ServeMux
[00:12:52] <mikoto-chan> thanks!
[00:13:28] <mikoto-chan> but would that be an solution? to catch requests to "/books/" before they reach my other handler? if I'm not wrong longest requests are dealt with first
[00:14:59] <ikke> which other handler?
[00:15:31] <mikoto-chan> wait, I'll send you a paste
[00:16:13] <ikke> note that, in any case, you could just add a standard webserver in front to handle static files
[00:17:18] <ikke> so you could let that webserver handle /books/, without directory listing, and then pass dynamic requests on to your application

[00:18:46] <ikke> "Longer patterns take precedence over shorter ones, so that if there are handlers registered for both "/images/" and "/images/thumbnails/", the latter handler will be called for paths beginning "/images/thumbnails/" and the former will receive requests for any other paths in the "/images/" subtree.

[22:42:40] <mikoto-chan> lazyreader: sorry forgot that I had to wrap a function yeah, it seems to be working but is this safe for concurrent usage?
[22:43:34] <lazyreader> The http library invokes each request in its own goroutine. Anything you share between handlers needs to be safe for concurrent usage, of course, but the pattern is sound overall
[22:44:29] <mikoto-chan> alright, let's finish up quickly to see if it's working :)
[22:44:44] <lazyreader> i.e. if you provide a database connection make sure it provides a concurrent-safe connection pool, etc. (most do by default)
[22:45:10] <mikoto-chan> yeah, I was thinking of using a database in the future because rn I'm just spamming ioutil calls
