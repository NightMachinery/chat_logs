[00:07:49] <emmeka> it's basically a verbal rhetorical question mark
[00:07:52] <Poeticode> 1,1 kinda wish the mom would just transfer custody to the guy. she's an abusive mess
[00:07:58] <Jigsy> So they're ?rens?
[00:08:23] <Jigsy> In Japan they'd be called „Åãren...s... oh...
[00:08:40] <Jigsy> Full circle!
[00:09:50] <MootPoot> EMMEKA
[00:09:58] <MootPoot> KYU~N!

[00:11:15] <emmeka> MootPoot a little. it's going better, but not okay.
[00:11:33] <ezekielnoob> 01 i feel like Yoshi did all the right things tho, even if it's obvious that she loves her even when she's only 16
[00:11:36] <ezekielnoob> oops
[00:11:43] <ezekielnoob> forgot to add colors
[00:12:11] <ezekielnoob> not all love have to be romatic tho

[00:16:37] <Poeticode> 1,1 sucks that yoshida's other love interests are crazy Yuzuha and Gotou the tease lol
[00:17:51] <MootPoot> idk what the show is trying to saw

[00:18:06] <MootPoot> as long as I dont touch em
[00:18:17] <hassoon> dooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooods
[00:19:19] <ezekielnoob> 01 it seems the only bad character was her mom, all of them are good people, well even the guy that tried to rape her apologized
[00:19:37] <ezekielnoob> wtf am i not doing this color thing correctly
[00:19:39] <ezekielnoob> my bad for spoilers

[00:20:10] <ezekielnoob> i don't wnat to ruit it for anyone that might be interested
[00:20:12] <MootPoot> if a spoiler ruined the show for you then it was a mediocre show anyway

[00:20:14] <MootPoot> imo
[00:20:51] <ezekielnoob> i may have to agree on that one

[01:19:19] <mexen> how's that bidet treating you?
[01:19:24] <Roey> good point on the homogeneity aspect.
[01:19:48] <Roey> mexen: well I inspected it w/a plumber yesterdya.. opened the box that's been sitting here for two weeks.  Guess what.. it's all shattered inside.
[01:19:48] <MootPoot> mexen:  its amazing really
[01:19:50] <Roey> like, wtf
[01:19:55] <MootPoot> I have one problem on my side though
[01:19:56] <chameleon> tbf some japanese media does touch on e.g. how people treat haafus
[01:19:57] <Roey> so I called the company & they gave me a refund.
[01:20:04] <Roey> I bought another from a different place & it'll be here next week.

[01:20:57] <MootPoot> but my issue is that I have a pair of balls
[01:21:11] <mexen> Also MootPoot has being an iToddler going?
[01:21:14] <MootPoot> the rear nozzle ones cant really seem to get down there and wash it
[01:21:19] <MootPoot> my pp that is
[01:21:23] <mexen> newbie2021: yes same mangaka
[01:21:27] <MootPoot> even on the front setting
[01:21:29] <newbie2021> mexen: what other manga can you recommend? Seems like you know good stuff
[01:21:33] <MootPoot> so I still have to use a bit of tissue
[01:22:15] <mexen> Hehe, I usually tap out at one recommendation a day but for you... newbie2021 I will break my rule
[01:22:22] <mexen> Liar Game
[01:22:24] <MootPoot> mexen:  eh, its alright. I'm liking being a toddler. I'm loving the touchpad and the screen and speakers
[01:22:32] <mexen> check that one out
[01:22:35] <MootPoot> the UI...its okay
[01:22:56] <mexen> MootPoot: nice! Mine doesn't arrive until early August
[01:22:58] <MootPoot> charging from usb-c is also nice
[01:23:09] <MootPoot> I haven't ran into any technicalities yet
[01:23:16] <newbie2021> mexen: ok
[01:23:29] <MootPoot> a few teething issues with a new OS as always
[01:23:32] <MootPoot> but thats really about it
[01:23:43] <MootPoot> wondering how to game on it
[01:23:50] <MootPoot> for the memes
[01:24:09] <mexen> After years of tweaking dots on Linux, I realized that all I need is a browser and a terminal on good hardware to actually get my work done
[01:24:30] <mexen> MootPoot: and the battery life? 
[01:24:32] <MootPoot> you do web dev?
[01:24:37] <MootPoot> battery life is stellar
[01:24:44] <MootPoot> it gets through a whole workday and then some
[01:25:07] <MootPoot> ALTHOUGH...some fuckery with the charger
[01:25:16] *** Quits: HubertFarnsworth (uid349353@user/saganman) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[01:25:30] <MootPoot> it seems like unless your charger supports USB Power delivery 3.0 , it wont charge at all
[01:25:32] <MootPoot> even at a lower speed
[01:25:35] <MootPoot> which is shit tbh
[01:25:40] <mexen> MootPoot: I am getting back into it, working on portfolio. Got me a linode instance, a domain, nginx and ssl, mail
[01:25:43] <MootPoot> coulda used my old power banks
[01:26:04] <mexen> IT project management really but dev will be a part of it
[01:27:08] <mexen> Awesome to know about that battery life and yeah, an external PM recently had to buy a new charger because he left his at home and tried using our phone chargers :P
[01:31:26] <MootPoot> not that its a BIG deal, like just being able to charge from usb C is enough
[01:31:45] <MootPoot> since you have much more flexibility, one bank for phone + laptop
[01:32:24] <MootPoot> but that being said, I dont think I'll keep this, I just dont need it right now for more then a few months, and then later if I need something like this I might consider the dell XPS 13 instead
[01:32:33] <MootPoot> something that can run x86
[01:32:45] <mexen> Ah, so.
[01:33:06] <chameleon> main problem with osx for me is the bsd/ancient gnu userspace
[01:33:15] <mexen> I still plan on buying a ThinkPad next year
[01:33:17] <chameleon> find in particular is useless
[01:35:22] <MootPoot> does anybody know a good resource on writing browser extensions
[01:44:30] <Poeticode> whatever you do just be sure to request access to all sites, listen for any changes on fields with a name related to credit card or password, send it back to your server, and disable the functionality when the inspector is open
[01:46:55] <S_T_A_N> LOL
[01:48:24] <chameleon> and be sure to make a breaking change that ruins someone's workflow at the earliest convenience

[09:18:49] <ButterNoodle> ?
[09:18:50] <theholyduck> during ww2
[09:18:54] <sscout> HubertFarnsworth: at least it's not El Salvador where women go to jail for miscarriages unless *they* can hire a lawyer to prove they didn't lose the baby on purpose
[09:19:21] <theholyduck> HubertFarnsworth: it was held by the spanish forever and then spain lost it to the united states of america in the spanish american war
[09:19:36] <theholyduck> which is why mcarthur was there defending it from the japanese during ww2
[09:19:36] <ButterNoodle> so I guess its hard to get an abortion in el salvador
[09:19:48] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle:  theres a lot of catholic hellholes like that
[09:19:57] <ButterNoodle> man
[09:20:06] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: but then again :P the us supreme court seems poised to kill any right to an abortion in the united states 
[09:20:24] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle:  and several states are clearly horny to pass similar laws criminializing miscariages
[09:20:35] <ButterNoodle> if spain didnt inbreed themselves into literal mental disability... where would be be today

[09:22:15] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle:  i mean yeah children growing up in poverty because their parents cant get an abortion and cant afford the child is heartbreaking

[09:27:29] <HubertFarnsworth> there is only god in ##anime ButterNoodle, Haruhi
[09:27:55] <theholyduck> HubertFarnsworth: i mean i havent read the later novels. but its sort of heavily implied that kyon is like the real god
[09:28:05] <ButterNoodle> HubertFarnsworth: I can get behind that
[09:28:18] <HubertFarnsworth> what the dickens?
[09:28:28] <HubertFarnsworth> I don't like that
[09:28:28] <ButterNoodle> only if she steps on me 
[09:28:29] <theholyduck> HubertFarnsworth: i mean for 1 haruhi is a much more minor character
[09:28:30] <theholyduck> in the books
[09:28:30] <theholyduck> :P
[09:28:41] <theholyduck> HubertFarnsworth:  you rememebr the disaperance movie right?
[09:28:44] <ButterNoodle> bc its a harem
[09:28:45] <theholyduck> most of the books is more like that
[09:28:46] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah
[09:28:52] <HubertFarnsworth> wow
[09:28:55] <ButterNoodle> had kyon is a pimp
[09:29:07] <theholyduck> HubertFarnsworth:  also like kyon is clearly the smartest guy in the book
[09:29:08] <theholyduck> by MILES
[09:29:12] <ButterNoodle> and I could use some more disappearance of nagataro
[09:29:25] <theholyduck> HubertFarnsworth:  it doesnt really come across in the anime caus they cut out most of his narration
[09:29:31] <theholyduck> HubertFarnsworth:  but... his narration style is very... 
[09:29:34] <theholyduck> special
[09:29:48] <HubertFarnsworth> I see
[09:29:49] <ButterNoodle> megane
[09:29:55] <theholyduck> atleast when i last caught up on the novels. the prevailing theory was that haruhi was just all purpose plot device to spice up his life
[09:30:12] <HubertFarnsworth> wow theholyduck 
[09:30:19] <HubertFarnsworth> you're blowing my mind
[09:30:22] <theholyduck> HubertFarnsworth: but notice how though like everyone is focused on kyon :P 
[09:30:25] <ButterNoodle> *all purpose quicker dicker upper
[09:30:35] <theholyduck> all the various people "observing" haruhi are mostly just interacting with kyon
[09:30:44] <ButterNoodle> bc its a harem
[09:30:49] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah
[09:30:53] <HubertFarnsworth> lol ButterNoodle 
[09:30:57] <ButterNoodle> faq
[09:31:04] <theholyduck> HubertFarnsworth:  ofcourse the anime refocused it a bit because. you know. 
[09:31:09] <theholyduck> weebs want story about cute anime girl
[09:31:10] <ButterNoodle> and kyon is the only one that time traveled
[09:31:12] <theholyduck> not nerdy dude 
[09:31:25] <ButterNoodle> theholyduck: but I wanna be the nerdy dood
[09:31:31] <ButterNoodle> so I can fumble the boobage
[09:31:39] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: theres a lat er story in the novels where asahina does it again on purpose
[09:31:42] <theholyduck> its a fun timeloop story really
[09:31:46] <ButterNoodle> asahina
[09:31:55] <ButterNoodle> yep
[09:31:59] <theholyduck> kyon gets visited by young asahina from 1 week in the future
[09:32:06] <theholyduck> with the message t hat "kyon from a week ago says hi"
[09:32:12] <ButterNoodle> wait didnt he time travel twice?? 
[09:32:20] <theholyduck> i think 3 times really?
[09:32:25] <theholyduck> he keeps comming back to the same point
[09:32:26] <theholyduck> :P
[09:32:38] <ButterNoodle> did you count disappearance of nagataro
[09:32:52] <ButterNoodle> didnt he time travel in that spinoff?
[09:32:53] <theholyduck> i mean its been forever. 
[09:32:59] <ButterNoodle> #metoo
[09:32:59] <theholyduck> i didnt count that
[09:33:00] <theholyduck> :P
[09:33:13] <HubertFarnsworth> I like how the conversation swiftly shifted to Haruhi from religion
[09:33:14] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: but like im pretty sure he both went back in time to the event 3 years ago or whatever
[09:33:17] <HubertFarnsworth> classy
[09:33:18] <ButterNoodle> damn.. nagatoro so cute in that

[09:34:07] <theholyduck> ButterNoodle: as i said the novels have a fun short one that goes over 1 week :P
[09:34:16] <theholyduck> that ends with kyon sending asahina back 1 week to say hi to himself
[09:34:16] <ButterNoodle> every time travel move always has MC-kun watchin himself time travel.. they did it in back to the future
[09:34:27] <HubertFarnsworth> Nanobot: just out of curiosity, how much money would I need for that animation crap of vtubers? 
[09:34:28] <ButterNoodle> one day I will read
[09:34:39] <theholyduck> HubertFarnsworth: its presumably all computer stuff
[09:34:47] <theholyduck> i asume they use some sort of facial/body tracking thing
[09:34:55] <theholyduck> and map that onto a 2d or 3d model
[09:35:05] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah theholyduck, but still you need professionals to do animation, art and stuff
[09:35:06] <ButterNoodle> some steam software
[09:35:07] <Nanobot> HubertFarnsworth: I don't know. Maromi did it all herself. In a cave. With scraps.
[09:35:12] <Nanobot> HubertFarnsworth: Suisei did, too.
[09:35:20] <theholyduck> HubertFarnsworth:  i mean the art yes
[09:35:20] <HubertFarnsworth> really?
[09:35:23] <theholyduck> the animation doesi tself sort
[09:35:29] <theholyduck> asuming you have decent enough stracking
[09:35:31] <ButterNoodle> can do it pretty cheap
[09:35:38] <ButterNoodle> lookup the virtual reality show with phia
[09:35:42] <ButterNoodle> she tells u how
[09:36:01] <Nanobot> HubertFarnsworth: Once you have the model and the rigging, the software takes care of the rest. It doesn't need any additional animation work for each video.
[09:36:23] <ButterNoodle> I think u can use a webcam and some kinda AR to get just face tracking
[09:36:41] <Nanobot> Kizuna Ai was an exception. She had a whole staff involved in the production of every video.
[09:37:27] <Nanobot> But the whole idea of Hololive was to allow the streamers to be independent, so that anyone with streaming talent and a smart phone could be a vtuber.
[09:38:17] <HubertFarnsworth> so I buy the software, hire someone for art, content then I am ready?
[09:38:33] <Nanobot> Hololive was originally a software product. Tokino Sora was brought in to be sort of the masctor of the product to demonstrate what it produces.
[09:38:44] <HubertFarnsworth> how much does it cost approximately? like half mil?
[09:38:52] <theholyduck> lol presumably way way less than that
[09:38:53] <HubertFarnsworth> promotions and stuff too
[09:39:13] <theholyduck> HubertFarnsworth:  i dont think the net cost is MUCH higher than being a regular streamer
[09:39:24] <theholyduck> just with the added benefit of being more appealing to weebs and otaku
[09:39:30] <theholyduck> and less chance of being raped by said weebs and otaku
[09:39:45] <HubertFarnsworth> lol
[09:39:55] <Nanobot> You need an artist to draw the art. That could be you, if you want. Better quality typically costs more, but it also depends on who you know and who just feels like doing it. Then, there's the rigging, which is a separate job.
[09:40:43] <theholyduck> its not like most of the like 2d style ones are really ESPECIALLY tightly rigged as far as i can tell

[09:40:53] <theholyduck> its hardly like full body mocap levels
[09:41:02] <Nanobot> The rigger basically sets up how the model moves when your face moves and does different things. The rigger takes flat images and turns them into the moving model that you see in videos. But it's a one-and-done thing; once the rigging work is done, you can use it for all streams.

[13:02:45] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: what I don't get is that bubble tea only shops deliver on Uber eats
[13:03:02] <DunceCotus> amigojapan problem?
[13:03:42] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you pay 6usd just to get it taken to you. It may better be a good meal
[13:06:07] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: whomever is ordering bubble tea on Uber eats is rich
[13:06:11] <DunceCotus> amigojapan that's not that much to pay for convenience
[13:06:36] <DunceCotus> amigojapan depends on how far you are from bubble tea

[13:45:25] <death916> all my channels finally left FN
[13:45:40] <death916> so i jsu dont even connect now
[13:45:53] <death916> i think my bnc is till there tho lol
[13:45:58] <death916> but on my clients i dont
[13:46:49] <Sumida> that's why it's not dead yet
[13:50:06] <death916> lol probably
[13:50:13] <death916> ill get around do takin it off my bnc eventually
[13:51:00] <Sumida> 10000 clients conncting automatically and none of the users even care or remember about it
[13:51:33] <ewong> amigojapan: I <3 mala peanuts
[13:51:41] <ewong> or mala anything..
[13:52:28] <ewong> so one will need to be an ##anime op to join #anime..   is this equivalent to #anime-jail on FN?
[13:53:57] <Sumida> one will need to have a genuine FOSS project or community to have that channel be accessible at all
[13:56:52] <Sumida> fuchs explained very well that this network is not made for anime fans
[13:57:36] <DunceCotus> Sumida strange
[13:57:40] <Sumida> even this channel does not really belong here at all, but it allowed as long as it doesn't create any problems for the rest of the users
[13:58:36] <DunceCotus> surely its on the same footing as any other off-topic channel
[13:59:44] <Sumida> perhaps. it was said in the middle of all the stupid arguing to grab ownership of the channel(s)
[13:59:53] <ewong> does there exist a network that *is* made for anime fans?
[14:00:29] <ewong> so basically..   like   <insert favorite football team> fans won't be allowed a #<channel>   ?   
[14:00:43] <ewong> like #nygiants ?
[14:00:47] <Sumida> absolutely
[14:01:40] <ewong> well.. that's their prerogative..   I guess..  still..  this is very arbitrary..
[14:02:31] <Sumida> not really. libera is primarily made for the foss community
[14:02:45] <ewong> Sumida: what about #gaygeeks?   how come they get a channel?    
[14:02:54] <ewong> just to name one 
[14:03:16] <ewong> how is that different from #anime?   like I said... arbitrary distinction
[14:03:18] <Sumida> I have no idea. just reporting what staff said
[14:04:52] <amigojapan> ewong: Is mala from ÂõõÂ∑ù?
[14:06:12] <amigojapan> ewong: do you really want two channels with similar names?
[14:06:14] <ewong> amigojapan: yup
[14:06:33] <amigojapan> ewong: ah cool. I love food from there
[14:06:37] <ewong> amigojapan: no.. not really..  just querying on this particular reasoning for not allowing #anime  
[14:07:13] <ewong> well.. #anime exists... it's just for the ops.   so really..   oh wait...  Which ops are allowed there?   the libera ones or ##anime ones?
[14:07:52] <ewong> amigojapan: I love food from sichuan..   but  can't eat it on a daily basis..   for obvious reasons :)
[14:08:28] <Sumida> it probably only exists to keep people from creating it and start hanging out without it being officially registered
[14:08:38] <amigojapan> ewong: I am Mexican so I don't have trouble eating spicy every day
[14:09:47] <ewong> cool!
[14:12:19] <amigojapan> ewong: my Japanese doctor said I just have tolerance cause if a Japanese person are as much spice as me, they would die, he said
[14:13:28] <ewong> amigojapan: I am not surprised..   I've yet to find a Japanese place that actually serves spicy food..   their curry ain't hot
[14:13:50] <Sumida> you have the poisonproof buff
[14:14:27] <amigojapan> ewong: try ordering 20x spicy at all cocoichibabya
[14:14:51] <ewong> amigojapan: never heard of cocoichibabya
[14:14:57] <amigojapan> Sumida: cool
[14:15:45] <amigojapan> ewong: it's a curry shop which offers up to 20x spice
[14:16:03] <Sumida> cool for you, deadly hot for most of us
[14:16:44] <ewong> amigojapan: would that be on par with sichuan mala ?
[14:17:00] <ewong> or on par with ghost chili  or carolina reaper?
[14:17:27] * Sumida read that as sichuan male
[14:18:36] <amigojapan> ewong: I have not actually give to Sichuan but I went to Sichuan place for Chinese people in Japan. 20x cocoichibabya is quite spicy
[14:22:08] <amigojapan> ewong: mala uses other spices other than chili too. Ëä±Ê§í for example

[15:02:52] <Sumida> it's not made for chatting

[15:03:36] <Sumida> so far I haven't seen any spam
[15:04:53] <Sumida> I would say IRC has the opposite problem. not too many messages. instead not enough messages!

[16:53:32] <amigojapan> Let me see ezekielnoob 
[16:53:58] <ezekielnoob> it's just toga :p
[16:54:29] <amigojapan> Nice ezekielnoob 
[16:54:47] <Sumida> ok, it looks very game like
[16:55:22] <amigojapan> Sumida: you can play it without a vr set too
[16:55:28] <Sumida> it seems movement and expressions is better
[16:55:36] <amigojapan> Yup
[16:55:38] <Sumida> but it doesn't have the usual vtuber feel
[16:55:55] <amigojapan> Yeah it's different
[16:56:12] <amigojapan> Sumida: kind of like IRC too
[16:56:55] <amigojapan> You join, you explore and find people to chat with
[16:57:55] <Sumida> drumsy was ok until the hardcore game advertising started
[16:58:13] <amigojapan> Yeah, it's sponsored
[16:58:13] <Sumida> that is just as bad as all the other big time channels
[16:58:25] <amigojapan> Yup
[16:58:41] <amigojapan> Most of them so that
[16:59:03] <amigojapan> Do that
[16:59:07] <Sumida> advertising has to stop
[16:59:37] <amigojapan> Sumida: they sometimes make it funny tho
[17:00:09] <Sumida> it's still nasty shit
[17:00:21] <Sumida> even when it's funny
[17:01:06] <amigojapan> I am ok when ads are funny
[17:01:40] <Sumida> most of the time they are not
[17:02:21] <amigojapan> Sumida: both technology connections, the 8 but guy and abroad in Japan are large YouTubers that never advertise
[17:02:54] <Sumida> I do watch abroad in japan
[17:03:07] <amigojapan> Well I mean they don't have in-video ads
[17:03:10] <Sumida> he's so grumpy
[17:03:14] <amigojapan> Nice
[17:03:30] <amigojapan> Sumida: that is his persona
[17:04:04] <Sumida> I'm not sure how much is acting and how much is real
[17:04:16] <amigojapan> Right
[17:05:18] <amigojapan> Sumida: if he really pushed natsuki into the water without letting him know, his wallet would have been ruined
[17:05:20] <Sumida> no ads in the video, I guess
[17:05:57] <Sumida> youtube probably adds them in the beginning, unless you block that
[17:06:31] <Sumida> that is still bad
[17:06:45] <amigojapan> Sumida: by the way drumsy's avatar looks just like him in real life
[17:07:05] <amigojapan> Right. I block everything
[17:07:27] <Sumida> you can't block the ones inside the video itself
[17:07:29] <amigojapan> But I can't block then when they are part of the video
[17:07:35] <amigojapan> Yup
[17:07:57] <Sumida> too much money is wasted on it
[17:08:03] <amigojapan> Sumida: you can skip over them tho. Using fast forward
[17:08:34] <Sumida> superchats are total crap too
[17:08:41] <Sumida> especially on iphone
[17:09:05] <amigojapan> Sumida: why?
[17:09:18] <amigojapan> I have never seen them on iPhone
[17:09:30] <Sumida> because first apple takes 30% and then youtube takes 30%
[17:09:34] <amigojapan> I have seen them on Android
[17:09:53] <amigojapan> Ah
[17:10:10] <amigojapan> That does suck
[17:10:42] <Sumida> so half the money someone paid to the youtuber is gone
[17:11:04] <amigojapan> Sumida: maybe I should not be proud of it. But I have never given money to a super chat
[17:11:51] <Sumida> I have never done it
[17:11:59] <amigojapan> I see
[17:12:55] <amigojapan> Sumida: then hololive takes 30 percent
[17:13:16] <Sumida> could be. I don't know their deals
[17:13:41] <amigojapan> That is what I heard
[17:13:57] <Sumida> it is normal for such youtube groupings to suck the money out of any profits. not only hololive
[17:14:30] <amigojapan> I see
[17:15:03] <amigojapan> Sumida: how about Tokyo creative?
[17:15:25] <Sumida> isn't that just one channel?
[17:15:54] <amigojapan> Yeah but it is a grouping of many YouTubers
[17:16:22] <Sumida> I don't know much about that
[17:16:56] <amigojapan> Sumida: yeah it's a grouping of Japanese YouTubers
[17:17:12] <amigojapan> Err

[17:20:20] <amigojapan> spoonm: you know, I don't remember saying that

[17:21:06] <amigojapan> Lol
[17:21:36] <spoonm> what will the name of the podcast be again, amigojapan?
[17:21:41] <spoonm> something of weebdom?
[17:21:45] <amigojapan> Sumida: I can't believe he was so scared of riding a horse
[17:21:47] <Sumida> too much anime
[17:22:28] <amigojapan> spoonm: "the sultans of weebdome"
[17:22:30] <Sumida> horses are huge
[17:22:57] <amigojapan> Sumida: I have ridden horses several times
[17:23:11] <amigojapan> In Mexico
[17:23:14] <Sumida> tokyo weebdome
[17:24:20] <Sumida> you have mastered horses
[17:24:22] <amigojapan> spoonm: it's hard to get everyone to agree on a time to meet :(even with the web app
[17:25:17] <amigojapan> Sumida: but the geji geji . That was creepy
[17:25:48] <Sumida> very
[17:25:48] <amigojapan> Sumida: and next lost Islands. I don't like horror
[17:26:04] <spoonm> amigojapan: you can just try to have a first episode with everyone who's available then and there
[17:26:17] <spoonm> I dunno, wait until at least three or four people are around so you can start
[17:26:44] <amigojapan> spoonm: you have to be around right? Since you are recording
[17:27:11] <spoonm> yeah, but I don't necessarily need to be around if any of the people participating is using Mumble on the computer
[17:27:25] <spoonm> they can just hit the record button and record in WAV or FLAC and send me the file later
[17:27:27] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[17:27:56] <amigojapan> Gotcha
[17:28:52] <Sumida> two people will do, unless you are good at talking to yourself
[17:29:12] <amigojapan> Sumida: no talking to myself thanks
[17:30:14] <amigojapan> spoonm: I will ask everyone to install mumble
[17:31:12] <spoonm> amigojapan: en 'pero esta vez ibamos de la mano' ¬øla tonacidad de 'ibamos' es en 'ba'?
[17:31:55] <amigojapan> Si spoonm 
[17:32:27] <spoonm> y 'ibamos de la mano' significa 'we went holding hands', si?
[17:33:29] <amigojapan> Yes. But I don't think you really need to be moving like "went"
[17:33:41] <amigojapan> It's optional

[17:45:38] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: discord can video.. I was looking at a script that MootPoot was talking about.. it will record the audio/video.. mumble would be great for a podcast, or supplement it with something like OBS to grab video
[17:46:50] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: I think a good idea is to gather topics we can all talk about that way there is no dead air, plus there is plenty of content in the queue

[18:46:17] <HubertFarnsworth> that is important
[18:46:33] <HubertFarnsworth> for the first episode we will be talking about our fav anime right?
[18:46:34] <amigojapan> Ok
[18:47:13] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: introduction. Including a lot about favourite animes I think
[18:47:29] <HubertFarnsworth> alright
[18:51:41] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: don't forget to buy wasabi since I think your country will be the hardest to find. If you can't find it. I can send it
[18:53:14] <HubertFarnsworth> alright amigojapan 
[18:54:51] <HubertFarnsworth> now I am kind of hungry
[18:55:20] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: ouch. Sorry
[18:55:43] <HubertFarnsworth> np, It's about my dinner time 
[18:55:52] <HubertFarnsworth> how was your day amigojapan?
[18:56:04] <HubertFarnsworth> I spent all day reading
[18:56:25] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: excellent since yesterday. Did I tell you the good news?
[18:56:35] <HubertFarnsworth> the vaccine?
[18:57:09] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: tomako's diet has been so successful, the doctor took her completely off insulin
[18:57:25] <HubertFarnsworth> wow, that's awesome amigojapan 
[18:57:35] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: after only 4 months of keto
[18:57:45] <HubertFarnsworth> nice nice
[18:57:53] <HubertFarnsworth> Keto is really good
[18:58:07] <HubertFarnsworth> is it good for normal diabetic patients?
[18:58:20] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: yes and we got appointment for the vaccine July 14 and August 4
[18:58:32] <HubertFarnsworth> nice
[18:58:38] <amigojapan> I think so HubertFarnsworth 
[18:58:54] <HubertFarnsworth> my parents have changed their diet too amigojapan 
[18:59:09] <HubertFarnsworth> they are now eating only twice per day and nothing inbetween
[18:59:49] <HubertFarnsworth> 11AM and 8PM
[18:59:55] <HubertFarnsworth> that's it
[19:00:23] <amigojapan> I see HubertFarnsworth but I am not sure that is a good idea. In fact they say diabetic people should eat more small meals
[19:00:53] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah, I told them but they won't listen.
[19:01:03] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: big meals cause a big spike of blood sugar
[19:01:08] <amigojapan> I see
[19:01:22] <HubertFarnsworth> but their blood sugar levels are okay
[19:01:40] <amigojapan> Ah good
[19:05:10] <HubertFarnsworth> so Tomako san will be taking pills for diabetes now amigojapan?
[19:06:46] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: yeah. She read already taking pills. She will continue those
[19:10:40] <Poeticode> i drank a lot of poison last night :(

[19:43:03] <spoonm> see, this all started with a "culture fit" interview where I spoke to HR
[19:43:29] <Sumida> maybe part of the yandere family
[19:43:49] <spoonm> then I had an interview with the standard dev team that I was applying for, and that interview didn't go very well, except the python developer who the tech lead invited to interview me liked most of what he saw
[19:44:20] <spoonm> then apparently he spoke about me to the leader of his team (devops team) and he was interested in speaking to me, which is what led to yet another interview, the one that happened on Monday
[19:45:24] <chameleon> that actually sounds pretty promising
[19:45:50] <spoonm> while that interview went okay, I don't think I impressed anybody, and the team lead even mentioned that there were technically no positions to be filled in the team, though the company COO said to him they were open to the idea of hiring someone he thought was promising
[19:45:52] <chameleon> my previous workplace called me back in for a second round of interviews after they liked me but didn't think I was a fit for the role they first interviewed me for
[19:46:06] <spoonm> that's what they did to me, chameleon

[22:32:34] <Jigsy> I remember seeing this in an anime.
[22:32:41] <Jigsy> Well, the omake episodes.
[22:32:52] <Jigsy> Characters just ran up a hill, whilst someone narrated something.
[22:32:52] <Bco1981> they do it in love live 
[22:33:00] <Jigsy> I think it was Shomin Sample.

[23:02:24] <ButterNoodle> y would I not be?
[23:02:49] <MootPoot> dunno
[23:04:57] <MootPoot> got some insulation wrap for my AC hoses
[23:05:06] <MootPoot> best I could find is some with a R value of 4
[23:05:21] <MootPoot> I googled and you can get like R20 and 30 etc but its a pain
[23:05:34] <MootPoot> seems like for simple wrapons and flexible insulation thats the limit
[23:05:43] <MootPoot> best seems to be spray on foam that hardens
