[02:42:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/LbyxFk8JmPKPAQBvL/we-re-already-in-ai-takeoff ... I see Valentine is posting mystical bullshit again
[02:42:26] <Robomot> We're already in AI takeoff | LessWrong (Back in 2016, CFAR pivoted to focusing on xrisk. I think the magic phrase at the time was: I was against this move. I also had no idea how power works. I don't know how to translate this into LW language, so I'll just use mine: I was secret-to-me vastly more interested in being victimized at people/institutions/the world than I was in doing real things. But the reason I …)
[02:44:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> I do like that he's retreated to "li'l ol' me is bad at saying smart stuff with with words, so y'all be gentle now and take these humble words as mere hints to your strong and mighty brains, which surely know better than ol' me what I mean by all this what-not"
[02:45:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Whither the self-assured arrogance, the grandiose claims to being able to communicate and connect so very much more effectively, on account of his *enlightenment*!
[03:11:23] <saturn2> it'll be hilarious if LW goes through its own "cultural turn"
[03:27:53] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : Once this war is over, there is a 1000-page book to be written on how RUS organized what is incorrectly-called 'bots'. ie paid shills that try to change public opinion on social media
[03:46:41] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: I do, but I could've sworn I had all that stuff written up somewhere handy, but I didn't
[03:47:30] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : I always forget that 'advanced' military hardware is relatively primitive. Case in point. An export variant ukrainian atgm system apparently doesn't have the ability to switch languages from arabic to english
[03:47:48] <adiabatic> so I went back to the IRC logs and found it all, but the potatoes I made turned out like crap (near-burnt outsides, not-yet-fork-tender insides, would've been awful without large amounts of sour cream)
[03:51:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> :\
[03:51:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Near-burnt outsides on one side only? or?
[03:51:57] <adiabatic> both
[03:52:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> what
[03:52:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> how
[03:52:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> You definitely didn't follow the instructions, if so!
[03:53:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Let's troubleshoot. What kind of pan? What kind of fat? How much? What sort of potatoes? Cut how? Seasoned how?
[03:53:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> What sort of stove, also?
[03:55:06] <adiabatic> Big-ass stainless-steel skillet on gas stove. maybe 1cm, if that, ghee on bottom. Added sweet paprika and garlic powder directly to the ghee before putting the potatoes in. Slice slightly-thawed-from-fridge potato into maybe .5cm–1cm discs, put in skillet, cover basically immediately. The pan was not super hot initially and I don't think I really ever cranked up the heat except maybe on the second half.
[03:55:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... whoa
[03:55:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> 1cm???
[03:55:31] <adiabatic> probably more like .1, really
[03:55:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> ...
[03:55:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's a big difference.
[03:55:48] <adiabatic> yes
[03:56:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... sorry, did you say *fridge*
[03:56:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> You keep your potatoes... in the fridge?
[03:56:48] <adiabatic> I bought only three potatoes and I wasn't sure when I'd get around to actually using them. Yes, I understand this is Fucking Weird.
[03:56:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> wtf dude :\
[03:57:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also uh, you need to *lower* the heat in the second half
[03:57:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Heat high first half, heat low second half
[03:57:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also
[03:57:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is this skillet ... seasoned?
[03:57:40] <adiabatic> Stainless-steel skillets get seasoned?
[03:57:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> y...yes
[03:57:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean you don't have to
[03:58:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> But then you shouldn't cook potatoes in them?
[03:58:14] <adiabatic> Like, a layer of magic polymerized fat on the bottom of a…stainless-steel skillet?
[03:58:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes... it's harder than doing it to carbon steel or cast iron, but it is possible
[03:58:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> I wouldn't do it myself because, well... why not use a cast iron or carbon steel instead, right?
[03:59:06] <adiabatic> I've never tried. I try to keep mine clean with barkeeper's friend, so no polymerization.
[03:59:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> But my point is that if you have an un-seasoned, not-nonstick skillet
[03:59:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> That is decidedly less than ideal
[03:59:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> For this purpose
[03:59:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> How much did you salt the potatoes
[03:59:54] <adiabatic> the thing that makes me scratch my head the most was "why wasn't the insides cooked"
[04:00:10] <adiabatic> Eh, a sprinkle on top on each side.
[04:00:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Why wasn't the insides cooked" is obvious enough
[04:00:37] <adiabatic> I should have gone lower and slower?
[04:00:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> You got it
[04:01:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> So
[04:01:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> 1. Use an appropriate skillet
[04:01:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2. Thaw your potatoes fully before cooking
[04:01:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> 3. Slice thicker
[04:01:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> 4. Season properly, i.e. sprinkle salt and other seasonings on your potatoes after putting them in pan, then toss with spatula
[04:02:12] *** Quits: two2thehead (~user@124.195.205.62) (Quit: Leaving)
[04:02:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> 5. Medium-high to high heat for several minutes initially, then flip and the rest on low (and I mean low)
[04:03:02] <adiabatic> What's your ETA for "the rest on low"? 15 minutes?
[04:03:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> At least
[04:04:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also
[04:04:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> You said big-ass skillet, how big we talking? And how much potatoes?
[04:04:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> The potatoes need to be, like, filling the skillet
[04:05:28] <adiabatic> 12.5" skillet. One big potato. The potato filled the skillet, and wasn't super crowded.
[04:05:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Umm, hm
[04:05:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guess if you sliced them that thinly then that checks out
[04:06:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But you shouldn't slice quite so thin)
[04:06:10] <adiabatic> I mean, the thinner ones were worse.
[04:06:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, that's what I'm saying
[04:06:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> What kind of potato was this, anyway? Russet?
[04:07:04] <adiabatic> Yup. Boring-ass Russet potato.
[04:07:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> So do you in fact have another skillet to use?
[04:07:49] <adiabatic> The only other type I have is Teflon-coated. I assume that's no better.
[04:08:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... it is of course better
[04:08:05] <adiabatic> For this?
[04:08:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes!
[04:08:13] <adiabatic> Why? Nothing stuck.
[04:08:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> :\
[04:08:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> How big is the teflon one
[04:08:39] <adiabatic> Not sure. 10"? 12"?
[04:08:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok well
[04:08:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Use that one next time
[04:08:54] <adiabatic> Why, though?
[04:09:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> You'll see
[04:10:01] <adiabatic> Should I be sure I will?
[04:10:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well
[04:10:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> *I* would be sure
[04:10:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> But then again I don't refrigerate my potatoes, etc. :p
[04:10:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> (i.e. who knows what weird failure modes you'll dig up next time... :p )
[04:11:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, I guess you can do an experiment

[08:10:42] <adiabatic> I like him more than the new guy, but I can't be sure that's just the nostalgia talking
[08:11:11] <quanticle> My problem with the way that Daniel Craig plays James Bond is that he plays James Bond as if he were Jason Bourne.

[08:13:20] <quanticle> Anyway, the point I was trying to get at is that Bond has action, but it's not primarily about the action. The action is there as a means to get Bond into predicaments and allow him to exchange bon mots with the evil mastermind, the mastermind's henchmen, or the lovely lady
[08:13:34] <quanticle> And both Pierce Brosnan and Sean Connery seemed to get that

[12:27:50] <quanticle> capisce: I want to like that thread, but it's premise is bullshit
[12:28:06] <quanticle> It's literally just _The Lexus and the Olive Tree_ in tweet thread form
[12:28:19] <quanticle> And the dude doesn't even acknowledge that he's cribbing from Friedman
[12:29:32] <quanticle> As I was reading that thread, I was thinking about China, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, etc. All of those countries were dictatorships. All of them were (and in the case of China and Vietnam, are) pretty fantastically corrupt.
[12:29:48] <quanticle> And yet, they make things. They actually do manage to do import substitution

[12:32:07] <quanticle> Were they???? 
[12:32:16] <quanticle> They were doing great, you say?
[12:32:51] <quanticle> Uh huh, so this is why their planes were made out of stainless fucking steel, because they didn't have the metallurgy to produce aircraft grade alumninum or titanium
[12:32:59] <quanticle> This is why their radar sets used vacuum tubes
[12:33:05] <quanticle> Superior Soviet engineering
[12:35:46] <quanticle> To reiterate my point above, Thomas Friedman made the points above when he said that the reason the Soviet Union fell was because it suffered from "microchip immune deficiency syndrome" and, as a result it's governmental "operating system" couldn't run the "hardware" of a modern society. (Yep, it's a Tom Friedman metaphor salad)
[12:36:03] <quanticle> It was a stupid argument in 1999, and it's even stupider in 2022
[12:36:59] <saturn2> tom friedman won't know if he ever has a stroke because he always feels that way
[12:37:43] *** Joins: two2thehead (~user@124.195.205.62)
[12:38:43] <quanticle> My mom was praying for Vladimir Putin to have a stroke, but Vladimir Putin seems like a pretty healthy guy. What if we sent Tom Friedman over to Moscow as our "special envoy" to meet with Putin and infect him with whatever mindvirus he carries? Whatever he has is contagious to at least some degree, otherwise he wouldn't keep getting recurring invites Brookings panels.
[12:44:49] <quanticle> That thread did have one good aspect to it: I will never hear "Avocados From Mexico!" the same way ever again
[12:46:04] <saturn2> nah that would backfire, we'd just start getting friedman columns about how his taxi driver told him dugin is a genius
[12:47:05] <quanticle> Unfortunate
[12:48:34] <quanticle> Anyway, there's a Hindi word that applies here: "jugaad". It's the art of making do, of jury-rigging a solution that barely works with limited resources. The Soviet economy was a master of jugaad, as was the Indian economy when the Indian economy resembled the Soviet one.
[12:49:07] <capisce> quanticle: not sure what you consider to be the premise of that thread
[12:49:29] <quanticle> If we cut off Russia from international trade, well, they'll find a way to make do. Will they be able to send the tractors to the Czech Republic for repairs? No. But they'll machine some parts and buy some replacement chips from China. Will they work? Sorta. But the thing is, sorta is good enough.
[12:50:15] <quanticle> capisce: The Russian economy isn't going to implode in a way that results in political change
[12:50:16] <capisce> sure they'll find ways to make do, but it'll be a pain
[12:50:19] <quanticle> Sure
[12:51:14] <quanticle> And like Obormot\Arcturus pointed out above:
[12:51:16] <quanticle> 2022-03-08 21:13:15     Obormot\Arcturus        Meanwhile... seeing a lot of people discussing sanctions ... can they work (most people say no), etc. ... and it just seems like... ok, so the main sticking point 
[12:51:18] <quanticle> is, how much economic hardship will the Russian people tolerate, before they rise up and overthrow Putin. Right?
[12:51:20] <capisce> https://nitter.net/kamilkazani/status/1501422818138935297
[12:51:20] <quanticle> 2022-03-08 21:13:44     Obormot\Arcturus        Let's just ask that again

[12:52:00] <capisce> are the sanctions only about causing the Russian people to overthrow Putin?

[12:52:52] <capisce> or are they about weakening Russia to undermine their war effort in Ukraine, and make them think twice about invading other countries?
[12:52:59] *** Joins: boubacious (~boubaciou@h-213-164-204-45.NA.cust.bahnhof.se)
[12:53:05] <quanticle> I don't even know
[12:53:25] <capisce> I agree that the former seems somewhat unrealistic
[12:53:37] <saturn2> it's just based on emotion, there's no strategy behind it
[12:53:39] <quanticle> It seems like the Ukrainian military is doing a pretty good job of undermining the Russian war effort and making them think twice about invading other countries.
[12:53:56] <capisce> when saying "can the sanctions work" you also need to define "work"
[12:54:18] <quanticle> Yeah, like saturn2 says, we're throwing sanctions because it makes us feel righteous and it allows political leaders to show their people that they're doing something without risking world war 3
[12:54:32] <quanticle> So in that sense, sanctions are working absolutely as designed
[12:54:35] <quanticle> Perfect 10/10
[12:55:08] <capisce> so you don't think they're useful from the point of view of making Russia less likely to pull a similar stunt in the future?
[12:55:14] <quanticle> No, absolutely not
[12:55:55] <quanticle> I think what's making Russia think twice about pulling a similar stunt in the future is the 900-odd vehicles and 100-odd tanks they lost in two weeks trying to invade what they thought would be a cakewalk
[12:56:08] <capisce> maybe not on their own, but combined with their struggles in Ukraine they might be effective
[12:56:44] <capisce> surely they're not exactly making their war effort cheaper
[12:57:12] <saturn2> for it to make russia less likely to do something in the future, we would need to be willing to let russians starve indefinitely, and we're probably not. if we let them eat again it will just mean they hate us even more
[12:57:44] <capisce> I don't know, that seems rather black and white
[12:57:58] <saturn2> we already did this experiment
[12:58:04] <quanticle> And it's not just me: sanctions are hugely controversial in the IR literature
[12:58:14] <capisce> North Korea you mean
[12:58:18] <saturn2> that's literally how we got putin
[12:58:19] <quanticle> And Cuba
[12:58:39] <quanticle> And Iraq too
[12:58:40] <saturn2> not to mention hitler
[12:58:41] <capisce> wouldn't a more economically powerful North Korea be even more of a problem?
[12:58:54] <quanticle> No
[13:01:48] <capisce> so you think the sanctions will make Russia more, instead of less likely to invade other countries?
[13:01:53] <quanticle> No.
[13:02:14] <quanticle> I think the sanctions don't matter.
[13:03:27] <quanticle> What will make Russia more or less likely to invade other countries is whether Putin thinks he can get away with it, and so far, he hasn't. Ukraine is fighting hard, and I think that's doing way more to affect the Russian reasoning about the future than any punitive sanctions the West is imposing.
[13:03:35] <saturn2> putin won't live much longer, i think sanctions make it more likely that the next leader will be as bad or worse
[13:03:51] <capisce> running a big military and war efforts costs a lot of money though, surely weakening Russia economically has some effect
[13:03:59] <quanticle> Money is a fiction
[13:04:08] *** Quits: _inky (inky_@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/inky) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[13:04:19] <quanticle> Get it out of your head. The Soviets managed to run an even bigger military with even less connection to the West
[13:04:37] <quanticle> And they did it for seventy years, with multiple transitions of power
[13:05:13] <saturn2> they're not going to bring back the soviet economy lol
[13:06:03] <capisce> I think it's be much more expensive to compete militarily with China and America these days
[13:06:12] <capisce> and NATO
[13:06:20] <quanticle> Who says they have any interest in competing with China?
[13:06:20] <saturn2> yes, sanctions will erode their ability to fight wars until they are lifted
[13:06:46] <quanticle> What we've done is create a new Sino-Russian bloc
[13:07:13] <quanticle> (Unlike the last time, the Russians are the junior partners this time around)
[13:07:36] <capisce> it's unclear how strong and long lasting this bloc will be
[13:07:57] <saturn2> not very imo
[13:07:58] <quanticle> Well, it'll probably last at least as long as we have sanctions on Russia
[13:09:43] <capisce> I think China is not too happy with the threat of nuclear war becoming more salient either
[13:10:30] <capisce> I'd say they're quite strange bedfellows
[13:10:51] <saturn2> china still needs the US more than it needs russia
[13:10:57] <quanticle> What proof do you have of that? Chinese state media has been behind Russia 100%. They've been suppressing anti-Russia opinions on their social networks and have been heavily pushing the view that the invasion was instigated by NATO and the United States.
[13:11:21] <capisce> propaganda is one thing, action is another
[13:11:42] <capisce> for sure they like to rally public opinion against the US
[13:11:59] <quanticle> And wishful thinking, which is what you've got, is a third thing entirely. What *evidence* do you have that the Chinese are unhappy with what Russia is doing? 
[13:12:21] <quanticle> All the evidence I've seen points the other way
[13:12:39] <capisce> they were happy when they thought Russia could take Ukraine easily, at least
[13:12:50] <quanticle> That China is, at best, seeking neutrality, and at worst, supporting Russia.
[13:13:16] <quanticle> saturn2: China is betting that we won't have the balls to sanction them
[13:13:24] <quanticle> Or impose secondary sanctions for trading with russia
[13:13:32] <capisce> mainly because of their own plans regarding Taiwan
[13:14:25] <saturn2> it's impossible for the US or china to sanction each other, they are joined at the hip
[13:14:48] <capisce> China isn't really imperialistic in the same way that the Soviet Union was though
[13:15:17] <saturn2> (not literally impossible, but both countries would basically be back in the stone age)
[13:15:20] <capisce> they'd rather copy America's model
[13:15:36] <quanticle> My take on the Chinese position is that they're going to continue to trade with Russia, and they're going to tell us to fuck off (in their "Wolf Warrior" style) when we ask them to stop.
[13:15:55] <quanticle> And then we'll impose some symbolic sanctions, and the Chinese will find ways to work around them.
[13:16:23] <quanticle> And things will continue on, much as they did after Trump imposed symbolic sanctions on China
[13:16:51] <capisce> sounds right
[13:17:18] <saturn2> symbolic is the wrong word since they wouldn't symbolize anything

[21:39:39] <Robomot> Theses on Sleep | LessWrong (Published originally (with all of the footnotes) on my site: https://guzey.com/theses-on-sleep/ Summary: In this essay, I question some of the consensus beliefs about sleep, such as the need for at least 7 hours of sleep for adults, harmfulness of acute sleep deprivation, and harmfulness of long-term sleep deprivation and our inability to adapt to it. It appears that the evidence …)
[21:39:54] <feep> I sometimes sleep five hours a day during the week
[21:39:59] <feep> I feel like shit after :D :D
[21:40:35] <galambo> so do I
[21:41:03] <feep> it's an interesting argument, at any rate.
[21:42:02] <galambo> isnt the point of things like modafinil and melatonin is to compensate for lack of sleep?
[21:42:21] <galambo> if lack of sleep doesnt cause any issues, then why do some people find these medications beneficial?
[21:42:35] <feep> I'm not sure how that follows.
[21:42:46] <feep> even assuming the premise, which seems simplified
[21:45:16] <capisce> also sleeping less is correlated with weight gain
[21:45:23] <feep> that fits
[21:46:22] <capisce> https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/molecular-ties-between-lack-sleep-weight-gain
[21:46:23] <Robomot> Molecular ties between lack of sleep and weight gain | National Institutes of Health (NIH) (Altered chemical signals that affect appetite and the brain’s reward system may help explain the link between insufficient sleep and obesity.)
[21:46:40] <galambo> I definitely eat more after my night shifts
[21:46:53] <capisce> "When sleep-deprived, participants had eCB levels in the afternoons that were both higher and lasted longer than when they’d had a full night’s rest. This occurred around the same time that they reported increases in hunger and appetite."
[21:47:16] <capisce> "But when sleep-deprived, they consumed more and unhealthier snacks in between meals. This is when eCB levels were at their highest, suggesting that eCBs were driving hedonic, or pleasurable, eating."
[21:49:12] <capisce> btw, linoleic acid (omega 6) is also a precursor for eCB
[21:49:29] <capisce> so eating vegetable seed oils also makes people hungrier
[21:53:09] <capisce> "Participants ate, on average, 300 extra calories per day when sleep-deprived and most of this extra intake was accounted for by fats."
[21:54:23] <phill> galambo: i think the point that sometimes, acute loss of sleep might not be bad could be true
[21:54:38] <phill> same thought behind hormetic type stuff
[21:54:49] <phill> but he also kind of mischaracterizes what the CDC actually says
[21:56:00] <phill> the paper the recommendations were based off of doesn't exactly refute anything he says
[21:56:32] <phill> (except, iirc, for one point he made whose evidence was published after the paper was written)
[21:57:00] <phill> plus it seems he has a higher burden of evidence for the more standard guidance than he does for his own observations
[21:57:56] <galambo> yes he is saying the whole sleep research is full of bs, and then he makes lots of outlandish claims
[21:58:30] <kuudes> https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2022/03/grimes-cover-story-on-music-and-mars musk has had second child with grimes, daughter named Exa Dark Sideræl, nicknamed Y

[21:58:35] <feep> it's a bit of a difference between a published study and a blogpost.
[21:59:08] <phill> yeah, i'd expect official guidance to have more evidence behind it than some popular blogger
[21:59:26] <phill> but it doesn't make his argument convincing
[21:59:42] <feep> something something p hacking vs not p bothering
[22:04:49] <phill> " In general, there was consensus that 6 hours of sleep or less was inappropriate to support optimal health in adults. There was also consensus that 7–9 hours of sleep were appropriate to support optimal health in adults. There was consensus that the appropriateness of 9 or more hours of sleep on optimal adult health could not be ascertained with certainty. Consensus could not be reached regarding the appropriateness of sleep 
[22:04:49] <phill> durations in the 6–7 hour range, but the median vote indicated this duration was in the inappropriate range."

[22:05:09] <phill> this is from the people the cdc based their rec's off of
[22:08:58] <phill> now, i do agree a lot of the popular science stuff wrt to sleep doesn't have as much good evidence behind it as people think
[22:13:07] <feep> kuudes: okay, grimes is a lot cooler than I thought, and I already thought she was p cool
[22:13:37] <feep> phill: consensus is kinda the opposite of science tho.
