[04:58:59] <earendel> one thing i thought one could want is providing some logging. or some handling that would happen when not debugging. i think it's worth to read that up for the case of node. but generrally that should be configurable on the host. i .. think.

[05:52:47] <ezzieyguywuf> `myFunc(x = x > 2, 'length')` is this valid javascript? I saw it here https://youtu.be/sCAR8ZPM6ew?t=1780
[05:52:47] <skillbot> YouTube Title: Functional Programming with JavaScript
[05:53:19] <ezzieyguywuf> the `r.propSatisfies` function ostensibly takes a predicate and a string, but I don't understand how `x = x > 2` is a predicate, it looks like an assignment to me
[05:53:47] *** Quits: onosendi1 (~onosendi@user/onosendi) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[05:58:59] <wroathe> ezzieyguywuf: It's not a predicate. He's being sloppy with his language.
[05:59:36] <wroathe> ezzieyguywuf: And that is valid JS, although it's not immediately obvious what it's intended to do
[06:00:14] <ezzieyguywuf> wroathe: ah hah, thank you. so really it should probably be `R.propSatisfies(x => x > 2, 'length')`
[06:00:33] <wroathe> ezzieyguywuf: In particular, in the comment below he shows a predicate function: x => x.length > 2
[06:00:43] <wroathe> ezzieyguywuf: But nowhere there is he providing x to that routine
[06:01:13] <wroathe> ezzieyguywuf: Unless that whole expression evaluates to the predicate?
[06:02:24] <wroathe> ezzieyguywuf: What is R? Is he using a library?
[06:02:40] <ezzieyguywuf> wroathe: yes, the library is called rambda
[06:02:48] <sheetjs> ramda?
[06:02:56] <ezzieyguywuf> https://ramdajs.com/
[06:03:04] <wroathe> ezzieyguywuf: https://ramdajs.com/docs/#propSatisfies
[06:03:07] <sheetjs> yeah not rambda
[06:03:13] <ezzieyguywuf> wroathe: yes the whole expression evaluates to a function that takes a single value
[06:03:25] <ezzieyguywuf> sheetjs: ?
[06:03:39] <wroathe> ezzieyguywuf: Yup, your intuition was correct. He made a mistake in that video.
[06:03:44] <sheetjs> "yes, the library is called rambda" thought there may have been a new library called rambda
[06:03:45] * ezzieyguywuf nods
[06:04:12] <ezzieyguywuf> wroathe: thanks for your help.
[06:04:14] <wroathe> ezzieyguywuf: propSatisifies takes a predicate function, a string identifying a property, an object with that property, and evaluates to a boolean
[06:04:17] <wroathe> Yup, np
[06:05:29] <pavonia> Is `new Foo()` always supposed  to return a new object? For example if you pass it an initializer that already is an instance of Foo, should the returned object be a clone of that argument instead of the same reference?

[11:43:53] <dka> as you can see, I have copied the metas from the twitter documentation so I can't explain why meta are not having any effect for twitter/facebook/whatsapp
[11:45:06] <sheetjs> those are not in the source, right?

[11:59:19] <dka> I can't do server side rendering, this is not a backend service.
[11:59:33] <sheetjs> are you just defining the components or do you also have the base HTML?
[12:00:19] <dka> This is the base index.html used with HtmlWebpackPlugin: https://github.com/pass-culture/pass-culture-app-native/blob/master/public/index.html
[12:00:25] <thykka> if you can't do SSR, then you're severely limited in many SEO metrics

[12:00:51] <dka> y
[12:00:56] <dka> but I don't want static metas !
[12:01:05] <sheetjs> some of them need not be dynamic
[12:01:09] <thykka> they need to be static
[12:01:25] <thykka> it's not a matter of want
[12:01:27] <sheetjs> take <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary"/>
[12:01:32] <dka> metas are here https://github.com/pass-culture/pass-culture-app-native/blob/master/src/features/offer/pages/OfferWebHead/OfferWebHead.tsx
[12:01:32] <sheetjs> does that vary?
[12:01:49] <dka> Yes, on event/product/offer page we should show the description of it
[12:02:28] <sheetjs> <meta name='twitter:card' content='summary'>
[12:02:32] <sheetjs> do you expect that to change?
[12:02:35] <dka> no
[12:02:41] <dka> now I just expect it to work without SSR
[12:02:45] <thykka> why?
[12:02:48] <dka> as you can see, I commented the dynamic part
[12:02:51] <dka> because I want to make it simple
[12:02:58] <thykka> that's the opposite of simple
[12:03:00] <dka> so I took the code snippet from twitter website and tried it, and it dont work
[12:03:06] <thykka> you're already on the non-simple side
[12:03:08] <dka> so why should I use dynamique ? This will add complexity
[12:03:15] <sheetjs> dka do you understand what the issue here is?
[12:03:41] <dka> twitter/fb/wa scrapper does not run the JS or it take the snapshot to early
[12:03:50] <thykka> the simple way is to serve proper HTML and content from the server, instead of using JS-trickery to render it afterwards
[12:04:23] <sheetjs> good, so what is the general way to solve the problem
[12:04:54] <sheetjs> either make it available without having to run JS, or make the JS run early enough that the scrapers pick up the new meta tags
[12:05:28] <thykka> even if scrapers ran JS, not having SSR will bomb your SEO score

[12:30:31] <thykka> dka, you don't have to reload the page for browsers with JS enabled, but the site should work as an ordinary page without JS, meaning links will point to other actual pages
[12:31:20] <thykka> and indeed "what's the point of doing a webapp" is a question I'd love to see more devs thinking about
[12:31:45] <sheetjs> there are good reasons for a dynamic
[12:31:53] <sheetjs> app but there are also good reasons for static pages
[12:31:55] <thykka> often it seems the point is "because everyone else..." or some dumb shit like that
[12:32:28] <sheetjs> there are tradeoffs
[12:33:27] <sheetjs> "you can't have your cake and eat it"
[12:33:50] <undefined_bob> sometimes its not that easy to make fallbacks for no js clients
[12:34:26] <sheetjs> developers want the SEO advantages of SSR but also want dynamic and responsive sites

[16:41:00] <thykka> arash, both answers lead to the same php page?
[16:41:17] <thykka> you don't need JS for that. Regular links will suffice
[16:41:39] <thykka> href="/other-page.php?answer=yes"

[16:42:14] *** Quits: Heraes (~Heraes@user/romarain) (Quit: Leaving)
[16:42:43] <thykka> of course, this means you have to build the alert box yourself.. the other option would be to use `prompt()` and then use JS to redirect, but that's not very customizable in terms of looks
[16:42:47] <arash> I'm doing it using "onlick" and "confirm" function, so is it ok to use it like "<td><a onclick="confirmfunction()" href="<?= "$id" ?>">delete</a></td>" and then declare confirmfunction() in script tag and add what i want?
[16:43:18] <thykka> attribute listeners are not recommended these days
[16:44:46] <arash> so what should i do? I just want a delete confirmation, if user click "ok" then send a request to a php page otherwise nothing
[16:45:20] <thykka> in this case I think it's fine to use a native confirm dialog. I can make a quick example in a minute..

[17:09:05] <arash> so for doing it via ajax request instead of using normal http link in order to prevent going to another page i think i should remove href attribute and do the ajax request in a javascript function, is that right?

[17:44:13] <lmat> I think a constructor is a function. When "new" is used, before calling that function a new object is created and assigned to "this" and that new "this" is returned. By convention, that function will modify "this".

[17:50:53] <joepie91> as a general rule of thumb: use arrow functions in inline callbacks, regular functions everywhere else
[17:51:36] <joepie91> very occasionally you will need the "lexically-defined `this`" of an arrow function in a case other than an inline callback, but it's an edge case

[20:19:06] <ironbeard> Does vanilla JS have a "pipe" type function for a single Element? Something like `document.querySelectorAll("td").forEach(td => {})` but to use with `querySelector`. Basically, I want to compose a function with the selected Element as my input without saving it as a variable. It's not a huge deal, but I'm learning JS and was curious.

[20:21:23] <matsaman> codebam: where?
[20:21:42] <codebam> I figured it out. I'm just using the network tab in firefox
[20:21:57] <codebam> I meant if I make a request with json for example how I'd get a full url for that
[20:22:16] <matsaman> figured, just didn't know the site you were talking about (beyond 'axios' in general)

[20:26:20] <matsaman> ironbeard: good question
[20:27:05] <matsaman> ironbeard: notably a plain for loop hasn't this problem
[20:27:12] <ironbeard> @matsaman: ha thanks :) I've been googling "vanilla method chain" but haven't found what I'm looking for.. also tried just looking at the autocomplete in conole for `el.` to no avail
[20:27:32] <matsaman> someone else will have a solution for you
[20:27:59] <matsaman> I mean you can always put an inline check if a thing is an array and if not make it one
[20:28:05] <matsaman> but that's pretty ugly too, if simple
[20:28:12] <GreenJello> ironbeard, you could make a single item array, or use something like this: https://www.npmjs.com/package/syncpipe
[20:28:23] <ironbeard> it's not a huge deal to just store the output of `querySeletor` in a var and then do my manipulations on that. It's mainly a code styling thing I'd like to have if it's available
[20:29:05] <GreenJello> overall, storing it in a variable is typical
[20:29:27] <ironbeard> @GreenJello: hmm, I'll look into that, thanks! Would making it an single item array mean somehting like `[...document.querySelector("i")].forEach(el => {})`?
[20:29:43] <GreenJello> without the '...'
[20:30:18] <matsaman> ironbeard: yeah you'd think it'd be available, and it may be I'm not remotely an expert
[20:30:52] <ironbeard> @GreenJello, oh yeah, duh. Hmm.. I suppose I'll just store it in a var. Seems easiest
[20:31:11] <ljharb> and clearest
[20:31:40] <matsaman> or you could have a function that returns an array version if it's got one item or an array
[20:32:27] <ironbeard> Yeah, since this is more just for styling code, I think it's best not to roll my own solution and just go with convention :)

[20:38:47] <matsaman> [array].flat().forEach() isn't terrible
[20:39:02] <matsaman> fair amount of assumption there, though
[20:39:24] <bmomjian> For this website, https://momjian.us, I have the side menu scrollbar appear only when the mouse is in the side menu area using onmouseenter/onmousemove.  What I only realized today is that I also need to trigger overflowY = 'auto' on ontouchstart.  This was a surprise to me.  Did I miss the memo that mouse and touch both have to be handled?  I assumed mouse would handle touch too.

[23:47:10] <Stanley> qswz Yeah I'm just not super good with JS so I feel like I might get stuck on it for a while
[23:47:51] <Stanley> I don't need to be able to add/remove or even move to different elements
[23:47:55] <Stanley> just re-order where they are
[23:48:28] <GreenJello> yeah, drag and drop tends to be pretty difficult to implement
[23:48:37] <GreenJello> lots of things can go wrong
[23:48:45] <Stanley> yeah and i'm just concerned with maintaining it long term
[23:48:49] <Stanley> I was really hoping I could have like
[23:48:54] <Stanley> draggable=true on each element
[23:48:56] <Stanley> and the parent be like
[23:49:02] <Stanley> droppable=true
[23:49:02] <Stanley> lol
[23:50:27] <qswz> Stanley: I used the flex order css property
[23:50:32] <qswz> !mdn flex order
[23:50:33] <jellobot> qswz, Ordering Flex Items - New layout methods such as Flexbox and Grid bring with them the possibility of controlling the order of content. In this article, we will take a look at ways in which you can change the visual order of your content when using Flexbox. We will also consider the implications of reordering items from an accessibility point of view. https://mdn.io/flex-order
[23:50:45] <qswz> a hacky but legit way to reorder elements
[23:51:08] <Stanley> qswz i kind of need it to actually move the elements in the DOM since I'm using that order on save
[23:51:48] <Stanley> foreach($fields as $order => $field) { $this->order = $order; } kinda thing
[23:51:51] <qswz> right so use https://github.com/caub/todo-list/blob/vanilla/index.js is doing that
[23:52:10] <Stanley> yeah but that's too complicted for my simple mind
[23:52:11] <Stanley> lol
[23:52:13] <qswz> well that version is a bit complex
[23:52:37] <Stanley> it's all good I was really just hoping there was an easy api for it
[23:53:48] *** Joins: onosendi (~onosendi@user/onosendi)
[23:55:47] <qswz> it's quite easy and fun to do without apis, I just complexified it for the fun too, do you use react?
[23:56:13] <qswz> without libs should I say, because you're using different DOM APIs there techically
[23:57:45] <Stanley> nope no libraries
[23:57:50] <Stanley> well alpine.js but
