[00:53:44] <krb> started reading a little in the "big picture" book, and this seemed like something i'd like to adress in greater depth at some point: how to construct meaning and values in a cosmos without transcendent purpose. A common charge against naturalism is that such a task is simply impossible: without something beyond the physical world to guide us, there is no reason to live at all, and certainly no reason to live one way rather than another
[00:54:17] <krb> could it be that the ones that delude themselves with mythological brainwashing is stuck in a "single theory" ?
[00:54:28] <krb> if so, for what reason are they stuck?

[01:08:34] <causative> the concept that the cosmos lacks "transcendent purpose" results from a dualist misunderstanding - the pre-scientific notion that "purpose" must be something mysteriously extra-physical
[01:08:55] <causative> in fact, purposes, desires, goals, and what we do to achieve them, are all physical phenomena
[01:10:10] <causative> the universe isn't uncaring; humans are part of the universe, and humans are caring, ergo at least some of the universe is caring
[01:12:43] <causative> one might wonder how much else of the universe could be caring too, or indeed what it fundamentally means to be caring

[01:19:49] <causative> it's not the same as saying the universe taken as a single entity is caring
[01:20:03] <causative> but there are parts of it that are caring - at least some of the human parts of it - and this should be undeniable

[01:20:33] <biys> humans haven't been around long enough
[01:20:39] <causative> we can put it like this:  "care exists within the universe"
[01:20:48] <causative> the universe is not wholly empty of care

[01:24:11] <biys> i'm saying it's a pointless idea
[01:24:14] <biys> it means absolutely nothing
[01:24:26] <causative> do you understand why I'm quoting those passages, and how it relates to what you just said?
[01:24:45] <biys> i understand you're attempting to validate your statement by qualifying it in a particular way
[01:24:48] <biys> it still means nothing
[01:24:52] <causative> and what is that particular way?
[01:24:56] <causative> show me you understand what I'm saying
[01:25:24] <dbl0snicker> Speaking of "meaning". I have a question. I'm reading "Language Truth and Logic" by Ayer (logical positivism, logical empiricism) where among other things he gives a verificationist account of how to decide what non-analytic propositions "mean".  Is he saying that a non-analytic proposition's meaning is exactly what observations it predicts?
[01:25:24] <dbl0snicker> That to understand a non-analytic proposition is to know what predictions it makes, nothing more and nothing less.
[01:25:24] <biys> i would say that the universe, using your example, exhibits ALL characteristics
[01:25:37] <biys> not just a single characteristic
[01:26:18] <causative> biys, if I say "I am not ascribing characteristics such as 'caring' to the universe as a whole," does this affect your understanding of what I'm saying in any way?
[01:26:31] <biys> regardless how your qualify it, it's nonsense

[01:29:20] <causative> greater by what measure? what measure would be appropriate?
[01:29:27] <biys> how did you measure it originally?
[01:29:31] <causative> I didn't
[01:29:34] <biys> sure you did
[01:29:47] <causative> I said "some" of the universe is caring - I didn't attempt to quantify how much
[01:29:51] <biys> you measured it by surmising that because humans care
[01:29:56] <biys> the universe has SOME portion of care
[01:30:20] <causative> yes, and this seems inarguable
[01:30:24] <causative> I mean, are you arguing with that part?
[01:30:34] <biys> it's nonsense
[01:30:52] <causative> I don't see how you can say that
[01:30:55] <audrey> dbl0snicker: Logical positivism is not my forte, but that sounds like a correct reading to me.
[01:31:00] <causative> because humans make cement, the universe has some portion of cement
[01:31:07] <causative> it's just as obvious as that
[01:31:18] <biys> the act of "care" is not the same as cement
[01:31:35] <causative> they're both physical things or events
[01:31:53] <biys> fill buckets with care
[01:31:57] <biys> then bring them to me to see
[01:32:01] <audrey> biys: Come on, man! :D
[01:32:04] <causative> caring is an act rather than a fixed substance
[01:32:17] <causative> because humans run foot races, the universe has some portion of foot races
[01:32:25] <causative> you can't fill a bucket with a foot race, but it remains true
[01:32:43] <causative> we *can* fill a bucket with objects that are caring - human brains
[01:32:44] <biys> you can measure a foot race by the amount of feet and the distance traveled
[01:33:04] <biys> how do you measure "care"
[01:33:10] <biys> specially in the context of the universe
[01:33:18] <causative> you can measure caring by how the person behaves - they show what they care for by choosing what they want to protect or provide for
[01:33:28] <krb> is the universe defined as a person?
[01:33:30] <causative> and you can measure brain activity
[01:33:32] <audrey> The human brain has a property of caring? I mean, this requires some significant ontological assumptions about the mind and intentional states...
[01:33:40] <krb> or is it since we are in/part the universe?
[01:33:41] <dbl0snicker> audrey What is your sense of the coherence of defining meaning this way?
[01:33:53] <causative> in theory, caring would be measurable in brain activity, if we understood everything about how brain states result in mental states
[01:34:05] <biys> this is so nonsense
[01:34:07] <biys> sorry to get upsdt
[01:34:09] <biys> upset
[01:34:15] <biys> but i'm kind of done with this
[01:34:54] <biys> i'd say that care is highly subjective
[01:35:05] <biys> and it wouldn't be measurable in the context of the universe
[01:35:08] <krb> is it some kind of einsteinian god idea? or a pantheistic god thing?
[01:35:23] <causative> everything subjective is also objective, because we can in theory use science to examine what someone's brain is doing
[01:35:52] <causative> not practical at the moment - except in broad strokes - but in theory, in the future, every subjective thought someone has could be objectively analyzed by scientific instruments
[01:36:07] <biys> just because a brain exhibits some particular result as a result of someone saying they "care" doesn't mean we can measure" care"
[01:36:08] <audrey> causative, you´re making some pretty hefty ontological assumptions here
[01:36:13] <biys> we can measure the result of their claim
[01:36:18] <biys> which is that it'll trigger some result in their brain
[01:36:18] <audrey> which are quite controversial, even among physicalists/materialists, I might add
[01:36:23] <biys> that doesn't mean they care 100% or 50%
[01:36:25] <biys> it means they "care"
[01:36:32] <audrey> so I do not think you are on solid ground here by just assuming them as true from the outset
[01:36:43] <audrey> dbl0snicker: I´m generally critical of logical positivism so I might not be the best person to ask. I understand you are referring to non-analytic as in, synthetic?
[01:37:07] <causative> biys, I don't think caring could be captured with a single percentage
[01:37:08] <biys> if all you're doing is measuring some particular motion on a graph
[01:37:11] <causative> it's not so simple
[01:37:15] <biys> and saying "look!!!  they care!!!"
[01:37:16] <causative> caring has many dimensions to it
[01:37:25] <biys> that doesn't really make any undertanding into the amount of care
[01:37:49] <biys> i would say your claim could be made about any and all emotions
[01:37:51] <causative> not just how much you care, but how much you care about each specific thing that you care about
[01:37:51] <dbl0snicker> Yeah, but I'm trying to include what he refers to as pseudo-propositions or metaphysical propositions, as before doing the analysis to determine what the propositions predictions are, a pseudo-proposition and genuine fact should be indistinguishable.
[01:38:03] <biys> i don't think you could really quantify that accordingly
[01:38:08] <biys> i care about food
[01:38:12] <biys> but i care about food more when i'm hungry
[01:38:18] <causative> yes, that's true
[01:38:26] <causative> caring surely varies over time
[01:38:36] <biys> i care about death,  but i'm sure i will care more about death when i'm on my death bed
[01:38:40] <causative> certainly
[01:38:56] <dbl0snicker> In this text, synthetic proposition is identical with "proposition making empirical predictions" or factual proposition.
[01:38:58] <krb> if the universe struck earth with something that made it explode or something. and all human life died out from that. could we say the universe cared so it got rid of humans?
[01:39:27] <biys> krb: we can make the claim that the universe exhibits all characteristics
[01:39:34] <causative> "caring" is a complex mental phenomena - as hard to capture numerically as it is to capture the whole economy numerically
[01:39:40] <biys> because a portion of the universe at some point in time exhibited those characteristics
[01:39:48] <causative> you can't say the economy is "75%" - that would make no sense
[01:39:55] <biys> in which case we could say that he universe exhibits characteristics of genocide
[01:39:58] <causative> you have to quantify each little part of it separately
[01:40:05] <biys> it's not inaccurate
[01:40:06] <biys> it's just nonsense
[01:40:09] <causative> it's the same way with caring; you have to quantify each little part of how you care, separately
[01:40:34] <causative> anyway, whether you can quantify it, or how hard it is to do so, is a bit beside the point
[01:40:56] <causative> because it's there - it's physically based - whether we can quantify it doesn't matter
[01:41:07] <causative> can we quantify a leaf?  not easily.  But certainly a leaf is there, and physical.
[01:41:23] <biys> i can quantify a leaf easier than i can "caring"
[01:41:40] <causative> if you wanted to quantify everything about a leaf you would have a very, very long road ahead of you
[01:41:45] <causative> current science can't do it
[01:41:50] <biys> i would say that given human history
[01:42:01] <causative> "everything" about a leaf would be every atom - every subatomic particle
[01:42:02] <biys> using the logic you're suggesting previously
[01:42:08] <biys> i would say that the universe is likely full of hate
[01:42:11] <biys> vs. full of regard
[01:42:41] <causative> it does have hate
[01:42:41] <biys> if we could quantify the amount of care that's been expressed through-out time
[01:42:44] <krb> yeah, the universe love to breed little beings into existence just to have them grow old weak and suffer and die
[01:42:47] <biys> vs. the amount of hate
[01:42:49] <causative> the universe contains hate, and it contains care and love
[01:43:00] <biys> i would say that the core characteristic of the universe would be that of hate

[01:43:49] <causative> but we *can* say that it contains both
[01:44:12] <causative> so it would be unreasonable to say, as a blanket statement, that the universe is uncaring or lacks care - also it would be unreasonable to say the universe is "unhating" or lacks hate
[01:44:13] <biys> i would say that the universe contains none of that really
[01:44:15] <causative> it has both
[01:44:22] <biys> it's all as a result of the ideas we have in our mind
[01:44:26] <biys> phenomena happens
[01:44:31] <causative> but as a single characteristic of the whole universe, perhaps it has neither
[01:44:39] <biys> we ascribe to it some particular idea based on how it effects us
[01:44:39] <causative> or it is neither
[01:45:12] <biys> like i've said.  the mass death as a result of the faild wildebeest migration is inherently bad
[01:45:15] <biys> because of the amount of death
[01:45:23] <biys> yet it's actually significantly good for the ecosystem
[01:45:34] <biys> humans don't like "death"
[01:45:47] <biys> so they rescue sea turtles with no understanding of the results it will have on the ecosystem

[01:46:12] <dbl0snicker> biys: Can you make a single claim that summaries your point?
[01:46:17] <biys> but your ideas are based on some presuppositions about the world
[01:46:32] <biys> you believe that peopel OUGHT to act in some particular way or another
[01:46:46] <causative> by this I mean that I want them to act in that particular way
[01:46:59] <biys> based on your idea of truth
[01:47:01] <causative> we all want things, we all want people to act in certain ways
[01:47:02] <krb> Hate is motivated by dehumanization—the tendency to see other people as less than human. This act of making a person or group of people inferior has been a key motivating factor in prejudice, discrimination, and oppression. - to have slaves - to have money and freedom to buy others work. to have some kind of value over the other
[01:47:04] <causative> you do too
[01:47:04] <biys> truth seeking
[01:47:08] <krb> hate is what drives the world
[01:47:33] <biys> what if you were to find out that the underpinning associated with your ideas of truth seeking are wrong
[01:47:39] <biys> not just partially wrong, but entirely wrong
[01:47:56] <causative> well, that would be a shock if it happened
[01:48:21] <causative> krb, if hate is motivated by dehumanization, hate is motivated by a falsehood, because dehumanization is blinding yourself to the human elements of the enemy
[01:48:25] <causative> blindness = falsehood
[01:48:26] <biys> i would even go as far as to suggest that the underpinning doesn't even exist in reality
[01:48:29] <biys> it's fiction
[01:49:13] <causative> krb, if that theory of hate is accurate, then understanding more about the other person will dissolve hate; truth is the enemy of hate

[03:15:02] <causative> what really matters about purpose, to the individual philosopher, is what goal that philosopher chooses after consideration. It does not matter to him what goals others might have. Even if a God existed, it would not matter to him what purpose that God might have for him, unless after reasoned consideration he also chose that purpose as his own goal.
[03:16:34] <causative> which is, by the way, NOT to say, "choose whatever goal you like and make it yours."  No, it is possible to be wrong about what you want; you think you want one thing but you didn't know the consequences.
[03:17:06] <causative> the idea is to choose not whatever goal you like in the present, but whatever goal you *would* like, if you understood all the relevant factors
[03:18:29] <assan> or just choose nothing
[03:18:38] <causative> No, choosing "no goal" is not an option; we are always acting purposefully as long as we are conscious.
[03:18:49] <causative> everything you do, is done to achieve some end
[03:19:13] <assan> stay alive and wait for the inevitable demise of the mortal coil
[03:19:29] <causative> that is a choice of goal as much as any other is
[03:19:39] <causative> killing yourself, also, is setting a goal and following through
[03:19:40] <assan> cool then
[03:19:49] <causative> you can't escape goal-oriented behavior
[03:20:09] <audrey> That's kind of tautological. :sadface:
[03:20:17] <audrey> biys: you like any 1970s movies perchance
[03:20:55] <assan> sure i see that
[03:25:24] <causative> some people ask, "if everything's meaningless, why not kill yourself?" a response to these people is, "if everything's meaningless, why not NOT kill yourself?"
[03:25:44] <causative> why prefer one option over others, if nothing matters at all?
[03:26:44] <causative> it's a rhetorical question to which one answer is:  we can't help preferring things and setting goals; it is our nature.
[03:27:23] <causative> when a person thinks about suicide, they are doing so not because they think nothing matters, but because they do think something matters and it upsets them and they want to get away from it
[03:27:50] <causative> even if what they want to get away from is "the thought that nothing matters" - that thought matters to them, a lot, if it's making them kill themselves
[03:28:13] <causative> so to do so is hypocritical

[18:31:04] <biys> and i'm more orderly than the wife
[18:31:14] <biys> i clean the house, i make sure everything is dusted
[18:32:36] <biys> my wife kind of just... leaves everything anywhere
[18:33:01] <biys> she'll go upstairs and get the kids a new outfit or something
[18:33:05] <biys> she'll bring it downstairs
[18:33:17] <biys> and the clothes she takes off the children just get left where-ever they fall
[18:33:26] <biys> she doesn't take them to the laundry room or re-fold them and put them away
[18:33:36] <biys> she leaves dishes where ever she's finished the food
[18:33:37] <biys> yada yada
[18:35:14] <biys> wife makes way more money than i do though
[18:35:24] <biys> my wife is what you call "educated"

[18:35:48] <biys> all her people are slobs though

[18:52:55] <audrey> biys: yikes, you have my sympathies
[18:53:08] <audrey> I was going to have married into wealth so I guess I relate to this lol
[18:53:25] <audrey> good wives don't always make good mothers though (and vice versa)
[18:54:00] <biys> and her parents are faultless
[18:54:04] <biys> even when they do something terrible
[18:54:08] <biys> there is always some justification
[18:54:13] <biys> or it's completely over looked
[18:54:27] <audrey> (it kind of stings sometimes to think I could have been rich now and I'm not lol)
[18:54:31] <audrey> (but that's peripheral)
[18:54:48] <audrey> Career woman, eh
[18:55:01] <biys> i don't mean it like that
[18:55:08] <biys> none of this is overly concerning to me
[18:55:12] <biys> it's just observations really
[18:55:24] <biys> here's just a simple example
[18:55:32] <biys> i do complain about her leaving dishes out all the time
[18:55:49] <biys> so yesterday i said to her "omg why do you always have to leave dishes out?"
[18:56:01] <biys> cause i had just finished cleaning the kitchen
[18:56:12] <biys> she turns around and points to a glass on the counter and says "you left a glass out"
[18:56:24] <biys> what's funny about that is...  i'm the one who always cleans all the dishes
[18:56:32] <biys> and me leaving ONE cup on teh counter
[18:56:37] <biys> vs her 100 dishes
[18:56:44] <biys> it's just so strange that she thinks that because i leave ONE cup out
[18:56:49] <biys> it's okay for her to leave ALL her dishes out
[18:56:59] <biys> i can't even begin to understand the logic
[18:57:06] <biys> but in her mind the rational works
[18:57:42] <biys> i could leave a pair of socks on the floor in the bedr room
[18:57:44] <audrey> biys: sheesh, are you married to my ex??
[18:57:49] <audrey> she would always do this
[18:57:49] <biys> and because i leave that pair of socks on the floor
[18:58:00] <biys> it's completely okay for her to leave EVERY ARTICLE OF CLOTHING SHE OWNS on the floor
[18:58:17] <audrey> Dang, relate to this.
[18:59:39] <biys> her vehicle is a complete disaster
[18:59:40] <Delf> brigand: You don't fucking care? I'm trying to show off here and instead you're making me look like an assholes for trying hard...
[18:59:44] <biys> i don't even like driving in it
[19:00:01] <dispersed> <- educated. Leaving clothes on the floor every day
[19:00:12] <dispersed> it's called focus on the essential
[19:00:17] <biys> you were likely raised affluent
[19:00:24] <biys> that is the excuse i hear from affluent people
[19:00:26] <dispersed> I was raised by so called free-range parenting
[19:00:29] <biys> "i have better things to be worried about"
[19:00:32] <dispersed> not being told what to do by the lesser
[19:01:12] <biys> what you call being focised on the "Essential" i call being lazy
[19:01:22] <dispersed> and of course I make more money than about 99% in my neighborhood
[19:01:32] <dispersed> that's my 5 cents, ta ta
[19:01:35] <biys> but then again, i just like a clean house
[19:01:52] <biys> i don't want to have to worry about my kisd picking up random garbage and putting it in their mouths
[19:02:20] <biys> i don't want to have to worry about bugs because the clothes have been piled in a corner for years
[19:02:29] <biys> creating a prime breeding location for bugs
[19:02:45] <biys> i don't like the garbage stinking because no one wants to take it out
[19:03:01] <biys> but i do understand what you're saying
[19:03:08] <biys> i've had the conversation many times with my wife
[19:03:12] <biys> she thinks she's "above" cleaning
[19:03:19] <biys> that cleaning is a "lowly" activity
[19:03:36] <audrey> She's not just, you know, lazy?
[19:04:06] <biys> audrey: well... this goes along with my theory that the educated folk really have no understanding of how the world works
[19:04:15] <biys> it goes back to the fight club analogy i've refered to many times
[19:04:30] <biys> it goes back to the idea that i've suggested about re-evaluating the ideas we have abotu "worth"
[19:05:14] <biys> i remember, about 8 years back now, i borrowed the wifes parents van.  i noticed it had a wobble in the rear
[19:05:33] <biys> so i called her dad and said "your van has a significant wobble hey?  have you had this checked out?  do you know what it is?"
[19:05:37] <biys> he said "don't worry about it"
[19:05:44] <biys> my dad is an auto-tech
[19:05:47] <biys> so i was worried about it
[19:06:03] <biys> i went and looked and found that the tread was actually separating from the tire
[19:06:08] <biys> which is extremely dangerous
[19:06:14] <biys> so i took his van back to him and showed it to him
[19:06:25] <biys> and he was like "that's not a big deal, it's been like that forever"
[19:06:36] <biys> here's another example
[19:06:44] <biys> his brake lines on his van were leaking
[19:06:44] <audrey> Man, now you got me feeling all bad for you
[19:06:51] <biys> knowing i'm mechnically incline he calls me up one day
[19:07:00] <biys> and he says to me "is there any way to patch a brake line?"
[19:07:10] <biys> i said "you don't patch brake lines, you throw the fucking things in the garbage and buy new ones"
[19:07:19] <biys> this is the same guy who wants to take my fucking kids
[19:07:22] <biys> and go on road trips with them
[19:07:35] <biys> with tires that are seperating and "patched" brake lines
[19:07:39] <biys> "educated" folk
[19:08:11] <biys> his latest one was...  the front head lights on his van are faded and foggy cause well.  plastic breaks down over time
[19:08:32] <biys> he says to me "i can barely see when it's dark...  can you tell me how to fix my head lights?  can't i just rub tooth paste on them or something?"
[19:09:06] <biys> my experienced with "educated" "wealthy" people is... they tend to be morons outside their fields
[19:09:14] <biys> </rant>
[19:10:23] <audrey> this has been my observation as well
[19:12:05] <biys> this got my blood pressure up though
[19:12:13] <biys> so i'mma shower and go wash the van
[19:12:15] <biys> "peasant" work

[19:20:10] <biys> so i got this call for no heat
[19:20:12] <biys> it was dead of winter
[19:20:18] <biys> 10PM
[19:20:23] <biys> outside of regular hours
[19:20:43] <biys> so i call the people up and try and get them to go through a couple thigns with me over the phone
[19:20:53] <biys> they weren't interested and just wanted me to come out
[19:21:10] <biys> i was like "well this is outside normal hours so there's over-time and this is gonna cost you a lot, so lets please just check a couple things"
[19:21:13] <biys> nope
[19:21:24] <biys> so i gets dressed and drive across town
[19:21:52] <biys> the problem was...  the visibly marked switch in their mechanical room that sid "furnace" was flipped to OFF
[19:22:21] <biys> $370 to drive across town a flip a switch
[19:22:34] <biys> so i will say... "EducateD", "wealthy" folk are good for some things!

[22:02:47] <pussipupu> it's "peloton"
