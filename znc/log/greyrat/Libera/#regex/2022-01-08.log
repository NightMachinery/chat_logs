[00:01:35] <OnlineCop> re101-donkey-30: What flavor does PowerAutomate use?
[00:02:33] <OnlineCop> https://www.tachytelic.net/2021/04/power-automate-regex/ implies that it's Javascript?
[00:05:05] <re101-donkey-30> I am honestly not familiar too much with RegEx.  Truthfully, I stumbled upon this a few days ago and it looks like it would help me tremendously for data extract.  I am trying to find documentations as I am by means no expert and as deep into this as you guys are.  It appears that there are many different variations of this.
[00:06:23] <OnlineCop> I think the main thing is to determine how to only pull the groups/captures out of the regex results, and not just the "match" stuff.
[00:06:32] <re101-donkey-30> I am just trying to get into using RPA software now..really without training.  So this is a very very painful process.  Trying to sieze the potential here while trying to do my regular job.  Just trying to show my employer how powerful this software suite can be.  But first I need to crawl before I can walk....Its painful since no one in my
[00:06:33] <re101-donkey-30> organization knows how to use this.
[00:07:20] <re101-donkey-30> Im beating myself up right now but I hope to learn quicker soon.
[00:08:23] <re101-donkey-30> I posted a message in the PowerCommunity as well to see if someone knows how to interact with it.  I know they are constantly updating this software so maybe it will get better at this. Drawing blanks.
[00:11:38] <OnlineCop> What results do "PowerAutomate regex" give you that help show how to get values back?
[00:16:23] <re101-donkey-30> This seems to be bring dollars back but its every dollar amount.  \$[0-9,]+(\.?[0-9]+|)
[00:19:01] <OnlineCop> Does https://regex101.com/r/qNhiVk/4 work in Power Automate?
[00:21:11] <re101-donkey-30> Nope...it brings nothing back.
[00:22:11] <OnlineCop> What was version /3 returning?
[00:22:28] <OnlineCop> The entire line containing "base/fixed compensation..." ?
[00:23:24] <re101-donkey-30> Nothing. Does not bring anything back.
[00:23:31] <OnlineCop> You might do a 2-step process. 1st step: version /3 and capture the entire line. Take that result, and feed it into `\$[0-9,]+(?:\.[0-9]+)?` to get just the amount.
[00:23:32] <re101-donkey-30> Ugh..so frustrating.
[00:23:53] <OnlineCop> Version 4 returned nothing, but version 3 was also not returning anything?
[00:25:23] <re101-donkey-30> (?<=^.*(?:base|fixed) compensation.*)(\$[\d,.]+)  Brings nothing back
[00:26:03] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/qNhiVk/5
[00:28:18] <re101-donkey-30> Bingo!
[00:30:06] <re101-donkey-30> This is how it comes out as...sample ....The Base Compensation during this period is $260,000
[00:30:23] <re101-donkey-30> So it brings the whole thing back..but I amokay with that.
[00:32:32] <OnlineCop> Right. You might need to pipe that result into a 2nd regex that only gets the '$...'
[00:32:51] <OnlineCop> Are you getting the regex "match" or one of the groups (specifically, group 1)?

[00:48:59] <OnlineCop> When you run this, you're getting "base compensation... $352,408.33" and "fixed compensation... $250,500", and however many other results your text file contains.
[00:49:45] <OnlineCop> For each of the results that you're getting back, you'll need to run a 2nd regex on that text to only capture the '$' followed by the amount.
[00:49:57] <OnlineCop> This is a slow solution, and takes multiple steps. I would prefer NOT doing it.
[00:50:52] <re101-donkey-30> This does what I need it to do for now.  You have been a great help. I very much appreciate it.
[00:50:57] <OnlineCop> What SHOULD be happening, is that your regex gets two types of results for every match that it finds: "base compensation... $352,408.33" and then a separate capture/group containing only "$352,408.33"
[00:51:03] <re101-donkey-30> I have to get my feet wet into this and I understand the complexity.
[00:52:32] <OnlineCop> Maybe what you need is to name the captured group.
[00:52:47] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/qNhiVk/6
[00:52:54] <OnlineCop> This should name that captured group 'amount'.
[00:53:27] <OnlineCop> https://plumsail.com/docs/documents/v1.x/flow/how-tos/documents/use-regex-match-to-extract-values.html is showing that they're naming their captures and using them later.
[00:53:36] <shantaram> ok i need a regex to match a line only if it ends with "\r\n", but not if "\r\n" appears in the middle of it
[00:57:50] <shantaram> maybe regex isnt the solution

[01:48:53] <re101-horse-16> I was wondering if anybody can help with this. So I want to put a new line at the closest space after 45 characters or if there is no space at 45 characters insert the new line at the 45th space. I have that so far and it almost does what i want. The only issue is that it places a new line at the last space always, I was wondering if there was
[01:48:54] <re101-horse-16> anyway to solve that. Thank you.

[02:08:13] <OnlineCop> re101-horse-16: You're basically wanting to word-wrap after a specific column?
[02:08:25] <re101-horse-16> basically yes
[02:08:51] <OnlineCop> For use in something like vscode?
[02:09:01] <re101-horse-16> Yes
[02:10:15] <OnlineCop> The main problem is with the substitution. There's no way to conditionally select which one to replace with.
[02:11:41] <OnlineCop> When you have a word that's longer than your limit (in this case, `\S{45}`), do you want it to chop up that word?
[02:11:53] <re101-horse-16> Yes
[02:12:33] <re101-horse-16> Basically I want it to do either two things at the limit. To either chop up a word if there is no space or if there is a space place a newline there
[02:12:48] <re101-horse-16> If its not at the limit I don't want it to do anything
[02:13:30] <re101-horse-16> Is there no way to check if the slices are a certain length before doing operations on them?
[02:13:52] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/tegL3v/2
[02:15:26] <OnlineCop> Atomics, which don't allow backtracking, might be one way to handle edge cases. With ECMAScript, you need to "cheat" using a capture group inside a lookahead, and then re-match what you just captured: `(?=(.{1,45}))\1`
[02:16:15] <OnlineCop> That will match those things, capture them, and then when it encounters the \1, anything to the right of that which fails to match won't be able to attempt {1,44} and then {1,43} like normal backtracking does.
[02:17:51] <re101-horse-16> I tried using a lookahead but couldn't get it to to work
[02:18:08] <re101-horse-16> I never thought about doing it this specific way, thank you so much
[02:18:27] <OnlineCop> Is this matching what you want, or are there still problems with it?
[02:19:05] <re101-horse-16> It's literally perfect
[02:19:13] <re101-horse-16> Thank you again
[02:20:23] <OnlineCop> When it hits the end of a line, do you still want it to match, so it adds in that extra newline?
[02:21:34] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/tegL3v/3 for example.

[02:28:25] <OnlineCop> That ' ?' (literal space, then '?') was to help my OCD for when there are trailing spaces that shouldn't go onto the next line.
[02:28:43] <OnlineCop> I don't know whether a '*' would be better there if there are multiple spaces between the last \S and the next.
[02:30:46] <re101-horse-16> I don't believe in my case I will ever encounter multiple spaces back to back so I think it should be fine

[12:56:38] <re101-wrasse-26> looks like some syntax error showing with this regex
[12:58:01] <karhunkynsi> Likely this tool doesn't support this regex flavour.

[17:31:26] <re101-donkey-30> Hi All I am having a really hard time trying to get PowerAutomate to find preceding text and then give me the first instance in dollars.  For some reason some of the files it opens it completely ignores it. Not sure why. I would like to try a different angle.  Maybe set it so that anytime it finds a dollar value give me the preceding 10 words.
[17:31:26] <re101-donkey-30> Is it possible?

[17:38:23] <digitok> what have you tried for the first scenario
[17:39:58] <re101-donkey-30> (?:base|fixed) compensation[^\n$]*(\$[0-9,]+(?:\.\d+)?)
[17:41:38] <re101-donkey-30> The flow opens up 600 PDF employment contracts one by one and looks for the word base compensation or fixed compensation. It sometimes does not bring anything back even though I open up the contract and see that it is there.  It must not be reading it correctly? I am drawing blanks plus I am not a developer, I really just learned about RegEx
[17:41:38] <re101-donkey-30> recently and I am a new user of PowerAutomate so thats like 10 strikes against me.

[18:00:36] <re101-donkey-30> is i because there is a return there?
[18:01:23] <re101-donkey-30> When I tried some functions with OnlineCop ...they were not availalbe in PowerAutomate such as the \K escape function.
[18:02:11] <re101-donkey-30> Perhaps when PowerAutomate reads the PDF they are not on the same line and indexes it to 2 separate lines and RegEx Cannot see it?
[18:03:54] <digitok> you could test with a single file and some words that you know span across 2 lines
[18:04:20] <digitok> try something like: lastwordofline\s*firstwordoflind

[18:08:50] <re101-donkey-30> I am just connecting to this one file. Digitok, you will have to talk to me like a 2 year old for now because I am so new into this.  Perhaps you can post an example and a link so I can visualize?
