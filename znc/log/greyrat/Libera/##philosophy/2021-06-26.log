[18:31:41] <voltage_> that's unethical
[18:31:55] <ethereal> yes, but expedient

[18:34:38] <kmh> and in irc it was usually/often used symmetrically (upon reentry of a chatter)
[18:35:40] <lalia> Thales is payed a fair bit more attention than I can understand considering we have absolutely zero direct fragments of his works and the reliable testimonia we're able to refer to present very little to go by.
[18:36:03] <lalia> An important sage to the ancient Greeks tho. :3

[18:37:42] <arryana> you do realize, ethereal, that you're suggesting lying and theft
[18:37:52] <ethereal> of course, but it could also be in jest
[18:38:00] <kmh> well he is one the 7
[18:38:09] <ethereal> you do realise that too I imagine
[18:38:17] <arryana> suggesting doing terrible things isn't funny.
[18:38:31] <kmh> however though not much is known about him, he seems particularly interesting for the sciences
[18:38:44] <ethereal> it can be
[18:38:49] <arryana> no.
[18:38:54] <arryana> it's just creepy
[18:38:56] <ethereal> that's the wonderful thing about opinion
[18:39:02] <arryana> whatever.
[18:39:11] <arryana> so, lalia, i got a chance to reread omelas last night
[18:39:21] <arryana> i have to say it made a very different impression than the last time i read it
[18:39:30] <arryana> i'm very curious to hear what other readers see in it
[18:39:48] <kmh> since he is often asociated with the early result in greek scieeces and math
[18:39:55] <lalia> kmh: Indeed. A little problem tho -- most people don't know who many of the Seven Sages are, let alone having any ability to offer comment... yet folks get all excited about Thales because we're used to having him as the first example of philosophy emergent from ancient Greek sources.
[18:39:59] <kmh> the first mathematician of sorts
[18:40:45] <voltage_> the thing about doing unethical things is eventually people find out and you're going to ruin whatever you've built
[18:40:58] <kmh> well i mostly know him fir early science resiult attributed to him
[18:41:01] <lalia> It's more than likely time to adjust that narrative to provide a better picture of who the so-called presocratics were and how there's no real coherent way to frame them all as a single group being used to ground philosophy in Greece. :)
[18:41:57] <kmh> without however it really being sure what was actually due to him or just collected/repeated to him or simply associated later to him (without him actually having to do anything with him)
[18:43:26] <bougyman> I think Thales fame is mostly due to the success of his school (the success of his students, that is).
[18:43:35] <bougyman> Anaximander took over and bred pythagoras and such.
[18:43:38] <kmh> most famously predicting an eclipse and 2 math theorem named after him (regarding peripheral angles in the half sircles and similarity)
[18:43:43] <lalia> arryana: nice! I know they're still planning to meet on Monday but I guess the first meeting will be staged as a text-based conversation.
[18:43:52] <arryana> excellent
[18:43:55] <lalia> It'll take place on that Discord server I mentioned. :)
[18:43:58] <arryana> is this usually done in audio?
[18:44:21] <kmh> i mean still pretty much any middle schooler has to learn Thales' theorem
[18:44:23] <arryana> it will be nice to more officially 'meet' you
[18:44:27] <lalia> Yeah, they discuss readings on the text channel all week normally, and then meet once a week for a voice session.
[18:44:34] * arryana nods
[18:44:59] <lalia> bougyman: I disagree, TBH. That historical reading of these figures is arguably quite forced.
[18:45:49] <lalia> I'll just leave it, y'all can have your Presocratics lore. :) It definitely bothers me as a classicist, but it also doesn't matter that much ultimately.
[18:46:11] <arryana> haha

[18:48:42] <kmh> well before Euclid the sources (on mah/science) are mostly rather scarce and often require lotsa speculation
[18:49:50] <kmh> but with Euclid's elements we start knowing things for sure althoug the knowledge on Euclid himself seems rather fuzzy still
[18:50:27] <lalia> Sure, and even at the time of Euclid, the records are real thin and read like much of the ancient mathematics being refered to had a very mystical tone to it rather than being instructional or practical.
[18:51:12] <lalia> Euclid's understanding of shapes without being able to use arithmatic turned out to be pretty impressive tho. :)
[18:51:38] <kmh> well we have  a number of a#older egyptian, mesopotamic , indian and chinese sources on math

[21:05:29] <Parf> i'm not suggesting it's not been there
[21:05:32] <spruit11> or feudalism or capitalism
[21:05:50] <lalia> I get a lot out of both skepticism and nihilism for different reasons. I also take it both are maligned for thoughtless reasons.
[21:06:12] <Parf> a lot of what out of nihilism
[21:06:49] <spruit11> Russian nihilism is pretty cool.  pretty sure audrey knows more about that
[21:07:02] <lalia> Depending on who's take you're engaging, nihilist takes on life and meaning can be a relief.
[21:07:14] <lalia> spruit11's got the idea.
[21:07:18] <Parf> i mean sure, skepticism i get. but what is it you "get" from nihilism. skepticism is a method, to me, in philosophy, never so much a complete statement beyond "i'm not sure, and i'm not sure you're sure" whereas nihilism is a conclusion, it seems to be more a whole philosophy
[21:07:37] <Parf> the only use i have ever had for nihilism is as an enemy
[21:08:28] <lalia> Parf: your understanding of skepticism is arguably limited to an epistemic perpective on the tradition which comes from people like Descarte... not himself a skeptic. His model was explicitly designed as a thought experiment to provide an abstract sparring partner for his meditations.
[21:08:47] <lalia> Ancient skepticism is quite a bit different.
[21:08:55] <Parf> do tell
[21:09:50] <spruit11> it's still mostly viewed as dangerous to existing power structures.  that has always been that way
[21:10:12] <spruit11> socrates and all that
[21:10:49] <Parf> criticism is one thing, but it seems skepticism seems to take everything as heavily doubtful, but that's as lalia says, probably a limited scope of what skepticism really is
[21:10:51] <lalia> The ancient traditions focus more on skepticism about philosophy and focus on forming or holding beliefs as it relates to passing judgement for the sake of achieving a tranquil mental state.
[21:11:07] <lalia> It is the lack of a position and as such there isn't anything to refute.
[21:11:37] <Parf> that's exactly why it hasn't a foot to stand on
[21:11:50] <lalia> That doesn't make sense.
[21:11:51] <Parf> just floating there, menacingly, waiting to be used
[21:12:00] <lalia> :|
[21:12:03] <Parf> sure it does. it's not a foundational philosophy. it doesn't posit anything
[21:12:09] <lalia> Dude, you're talking about my state of mind.
[21:12:22] <Parf> so? i'm talking about my own as well

[21:14:26] <Parf> i'm not resisting it so much as saying that it's just a piece. just like my window is only just a piece. some self-immolating figure on an altar every night.
[21:14:38] <Parf> we all have different standards for living
[21:14:52] <spruit11> what does 'just a piece' mean?
[21:15:01] * arryana raises an eyebrow
[21:15:10] * Parf raises both
[21:15:46] * Parf causes his forehead to fold into serried waves, to express his own confusion at the whole matter
[21:16:00] <arryana> from where i sit, you don't seem to be making a lot of sense.
[21:16:11] <Parf> no one sits where i sit
[21:16:23] <lalia> I mean, in a sense... The skeptic is in pursuit of philosophical truth(s) but with the caveat that we have none to advocate for in the mean time. I don't see the problem with being in this position, TBH.

[21:18:44] <lalia> The point is the ancient traditons arguably focus on doxastic attitudes instead of epistemic.
[21:19:20] <lalia> And it's more about finding a way of life that leads to living well.
[21:19:24] <spruit11> yah.  no worries.  I was just reflecting on the 'free your mind,  let go of your ego' popular line of thought.  cheesy sometimes but people can really get into that
[21:19:37] <lalia> :)
[21:19:38] <Parf> by all means, your "way" is in every sense of the term more effective or correct than my own way, even right, more truthful, but there are many ways, it seems, to "truth". I think there is one, somewhere rooting around.
[21:21:16] <lalia> I'm not with that TBH. I'm representing a growing voice among academics that see a need for addressing the history of skepticism and reassessing its influence on contemporary philosophy.
[21:21:30] <lalia> I genuinely thing the prevailing attitude towards skepticism is garbage.
[21:21:35] <lalia> think*
[21:22:04] <Parf> look, all i said is that skepticism can go too far. and that nihilism is bad
[21:22:10] <lalia> And this is a professional position: not just a personal annecodote. I'm working on developing this narrative. :)
[21:22:29] <lalia> Yeah, and all I'm saying is: that doesn't seem like the case from what I can tell.
[21:22:30] <spruit11> it's probably not a great thing to say to a scientist that you somewhere doubt his/her achievements
[21:22:45] <Parf> i can even say nihilism is probably "right"
[21:22:47] <Parf> but it's still bad
[21:22:48] <voltage_> is it about emotional stability
[21:23:24] <lalia> Parf: it'd be "bad" according to some version of moral reasoning, I guess. I just don't get it at all. :P
[21:23:41] <spruit11> 'teach students to doubt and they will all go of in the wrong directions' that's somewhat true too
[21:26:24] <lalia> voltage_: Ancient skepticism? It *can be* but it's probably more about easing conditions like cognitive dissonance and in general providing a means for pursuing inquiry through modes that minimize anxiety and confusion.
[21:28:43] <Parf> what would you say better fits the description of "what is now called skepticism"
[21:33:12] <lalia> The sort of skepticism you led with is the type of phantom foe developed by people like Descartes, but the are no sincere skeptics of the sort characterized. We're not aiming at undermining ordinary opinion or challenging accepted customs -- the idea of a skeptic who's honestly out to spread confusion or lead people into states of distressing self doubt is vaguely monstrous, it turns out.
[21:33:40] <spruit11> oh,  really?
[21:33:43] <Parf> and if monsters exist?
[21:33:48] <spruit11> elaborate
[21:34:19] <lalia> Parf: I mean, find such a person for me. I mean it.
[21:34:32] <lalia> Let's talk about it then. :)
[21:34:47] <lalia> spruit11: how shall I elaborate?
[21:35:41] <lalia> I've only got a few more minutes before I'm into parenting time for the day.
[21:35:50] <spruit11> well,  I would like to know about the 'slightly monstrous' part
[21:38:39] <lalia> Oh, skeptics are a real group of people, so thinking it's ever suitable to characterize them as honestly spreading confusion and leading people into distressing states of self doubt is dishonest, potentially harmful in social contexts and may even lead to cases of needless violence.
[21:38:45] <Parf> regardless, my beef is mainly with nihilism. as i said "i get skepticism" insofar as even the phantom understanding of it i held
[21:39:05] <Parf> as to malicious people, violent, hurtful maniacs? they exist. they aren't exactly plentiful
[21:39:10] <lalia> Skepticism is viewed with a tone of villany because of people like Descartes.

[21:39:47] <lalia> Don't just refer to mental healt issues as a synonym for skepticism or nihilism, Parf. That's not a good look.
[21:39:52] <spruit11> probably not a group but a state of mind
[21:40:18] <Parf> i'm saying it's a tool they can use
[21:40:23] <Parf> just like any other tool.
[21:40:49] <Parf> i'm only insisting that skepticism, then, should be used as you've so eloquently put it thus far.
[21:40:49] <lalia> I'll see myself out. If y'all are honestly interested in clarification that Ethan Mills book I suggested explains quite a bit of what we're dancing around in the first chapter.

[22:06:37] <zicada> that's what I'm saying
[22:06:46] <zicada> Amazon Norway treats Norwegians pretty well, etc
[22:07:08] <voltage_> so just because he owns amazon
[22:07:13] <zicada> Capitalism only works if you have a lot of rules and laws in place to keep people from fucking everybody over
[22:07:17] <zicada> *shrugs*
[22:07:32] <voltage_> shouldn't he get praise for treating norwegian amazon employees good
[22:07:46] <zicada> he should get praise for not breaking the law
[22:07:59] <DunceCotus> zicada this is a bit of a naive view of capitalism
[22:08:20] <zicada> but it highlights individual rights in USA vs EU
[22:08:34] <DunceCotus> rules and laws are precisely what allow for the worst of capitalism
[22:08:54] <zicada> DunceCotus: generally the capitalist argument has been "we can't do our jobs if we are impeeded"
[22:08:57] <DunceCotus> see private property rights
[22:09:01] <zicada> that a free market rules itself
[22:09:02] <DunceCotus> intellectual property etc
[22:09:06] <zicada> and that it ends up being fair somehow
[22:09:07] <zicada> it doesnt
[22:09:55] <DunceCotus> well at some point the state makes capitalism not only possible but probable
[22:10:19] <zicada> after 2008 as far as I know, the majority of financial scholars would agree that the idea of the free market somehow being fair if its allowed to "run free" is a myth
[22:10:20] <DunceCotus> that is to say capitalism in terms of relentless profit over anything else
[22:10:36] <zicada> yes, im not arguing against capitalism
[22:10:45] <zicada> im arguing against unconstrained capitalisjm
[22:10:59] <DunceCotus> my point is there is no unconstrained capitalism

[22:11:13] <zicada> capitalism to me is a tool that can be weilded any number of ways, one leads to class-differences, others lead to equality
[22:11:15] <voltage_> idk if any serious scholar would claim that
[22:11:44] <DunceCotus> zicada problem is its a whack-a-mole
[22:11:54] <DunceCotus> you make it better over here and over there it gets worse
[22:11:57] <zicada> DunceCotus: sure, completley unconstrained capitalism im sure is a utopian ideal
[22:12:12] <zicada> to people like Objectivists and Neocons
[22:12:40] <DunceCotus> zicada liberal and conservative regulated capitalism may have worked for a time in the west, but you needed exploitation of third world, middle east etc. to make it happen
[22:12:54] <zicada> agreed
[22:13:04] <zicada> or oil
[22:13:25] <DunceCotus> capitalism is unrestrained but not unconstrained
[22:14:02] <DunceCotus> to say its a tool.. not sure about that
[22:14:27] <zicada> You can impose any set framwork of rules and regulations you want, some will hamper the market much more than others. Some will simply reverse the fact that rich people are much better at getting good deals
[22:14:32] <DunceCotus> zicada we are used as tools by capitalism
[22:14:36] <DunceCotus> not so much the other way around
[22:14:36] <zicada> at the expense of poor people
[22:14:51] <zicada> DunceCotus: hehe
[22:15:08] <zicada> yeah, nobody ever likes my "capitalism is a tool" idea
[22:15:32] <DunceCotus> the fact that there is no opting out of capitalism shows its power over us
[22:16:05] <DunceCotus> even intentional communities have to have some adherence to capitalism (or its legislative framework)
[22:16:06] <zicada> hmm, depends what you mean by "no opting out"
[22:16:10] <zicada> plenty of ways to understand that
[22:16:18] <DunceCotus> oh?
[22:16:42] <zicada> wasn't 1917 opting out ?
[22:17:02] <DunceCotus> no
[22:17:14] <DunceCotus> opting out != insurrection
[22:17:18] <voltage_> hur dur i'd like to out out of capitalism
[22:17:20] <DunceCotus> it simply means choosing not to
[22:17:34] <DunceCotus> not building a whole new system
[22:17:36] <DunceCotus> or over throwing
[22:17:38] <zicada> yea that's being a bum / living on the streets / beeing free
[22:17:41] <DunceCotus> just.. not doing it
[22:17:41] <DunceCotus> :/
[22:18:00] <DunceCotus> zicada yeah but you still need to buy food, scrounge for coin etc
[22:18:04] <DunceCotus> that's still capitalism
[22:18:05] <zicada> or various American ideals about individuality i guess
[22:18:23] <zicada> sure, even in a post apocalyptic world you'd probably default to capitalism
[22:18:36] <zicada> which is kinda sad if you're a socialist
[22:18:38] <DunceCotus> that's because capitalism is more like some kind of reality virus
[22:19:02] <zicada> om a social democrat, socialism + capitalism. Its worked out pretty good up here
[22:19:20] <DunceCotus> zicada whack a mole
[22:19:29] <DunceCotus> im not interested in such games
[22:20:18] <zicada> what games
[22:20:20] <DunceCotus> zicada since there's no opting out I guess we have to either put up with it or hack consciousness somehow
[22:20:21] <voltage_> what makes you think that your reality is the right reality
[22:20:33] <voltage_> what if you're just wrong
[22:20:43] <DunceCotus> voltage_ its worth it
[22:20:54] <zicada> i dont agree there's no opting out though
[22:20:55] <voltage_> "worth"
[22:21:08] <DunceCotus> value without capitalism
[22:21:10] <zicada> i may agree humans default to it
[22:21:22] <zicada> but i think culture can alter default behavior enough
[22:21:23] <DunceCotus> zicada well how to opt out?
[22:21:27] <zicada> that in principle its possible
[22:21:44] <DunceCotus> humans default to it.. then opting out means also opting out of humanity
[22:21:55] <DunceCotus> or humans as we know them now
[22:21:57] <zicada> it's really on you to say who it's not possible in principle DunceCotus
[22:22:01] <zicada> you're the one making the claim
[22:22:09] <zicada> *why
[22:22:35] <zicada> DunceCotus: humans deafult to a lot of things most modern cultures dont like
[22:22:40] <DunceCotus> zicada I can't say something is possible until I know it is?
[22:22:50] <DunceCotus> otherwise 'anything is possible'
[22:22:55] <DunceCotus> which is asinine statement
[22:23:07] <zicada> DunceCotus: why its _not_ possible
[22:23:20] <voltage_> DunceCotus, maybe you need to read more about scepticism
[22:23:28] <zicada> your position is its not possible to opt out, why
[22:23:50] <DunceCotus> zicada it hasn't been done, and attempts to do so are unsuccessful, but sure that doesn't mean its not possible
[22:23:56] <DunceCotus> but it doesn't mean its possible either
[22:24:15] <zicada> DunceCotus: i dont think you can show that its never been done
[22:24:20] <DunceCotus> my position is opting out is seemingly impossible
[22:24:37] <zicada> DunceCotus: can you plasibly show it hasnt been done in the last 3-400 years or so, but not much past thyat
[22:24:49] <zicada> humanity meanwhile has been around in its modern form for a good 100k years
[22:24:57] <DunceCotus> zicada humanity hasn't always been capitalist
[22:25:03] <spruit11> most people I know who tried to 'opt out' just ended up gardening
[22:25:06] <zicada> the difference between the people back then and us, is culture, that we go to school etc
[22:25:11] <zicada> and are taught things, informed
[22:25:29] <DunceCotus> we are controlled you mean
[22:25:52] <DunceCotus> spruit11 gardening lol
[22:26:05] <zicada> ended up on the street
[22:26:12] <zicada> or living on some beach some place
[22:26:15] <DunceCotus> or the garden
[22:26:36] <zicada> freedom from "the man"
[22:26:42] <DunceCotus> sure but homelessness is within capitalism
[22:26:50] <zicada> absolutely
[22:27:03] <zicada> but its within all forms of goverment that are free i think
[22:27:27] <zicada> some humans are just going to be incapable of taking care of themselves or lack any fucks to give
[22:27:28] <DunceCotus> if there is a way to opt-out of capitalism it isn't like opting out of a email list or something
[22:27:37] <DunceCotus> its more like going utterly insane and hacking conscious
[22:27:58] <zicada> human diversity is such that you sometimes get a murderer with no remorse, etc
[22:28:13] <spruit11> or you grow veggies
[22:28:38] <zicada> DunceCotus: you mean it would be like opting out of humanity right
[22:28:45] <DunceCotus> zicada right
[22:28:55] <zicada> that there are bioloigical reasons that explain why we trade things
[22:28:57] <zicada> etc
[22:29:00] <zicada> which i agree with
[22:29:02] <DunceCotus> or jumping to ubermensch
[22:29:20] <zicada> and capitalism really if you think about it is trading things
[22:29:25] <zicada> just a lot more complicated
[22:29:41] <zicada> it wouldnt be unfair if all humans were identical clones
[22:29:45] <zicada> but we aren't, so it is
[22:29:47] <DunceCotus> zicada homo economicus
[22:30:01] <DunceCotus> our very biology is stricken by the capitalist 'bug'
[22:30:10] <zicada> hehe
[22:30:11] <DunceCotus> the very way reality is produced is capitalistic
[22:30:29] <zicada> i dont agree reality is procuded
[22:30:31] <zicada> produced
[22:30:39] <DunceCotus> too bad
[22:30:53] <ethereal> homo economicus can't be right, we're much more complex, but.. some may be exactly that way, that simply efficient
[22:31:06] <zicada> if you mean in the "manufacturing concent" way, i kinda agree
[22:31:32] <zicada> but then you're using the term reality in a pretty unusual way
[22:31:51] <DunceCotus> zicada no I mean literal reality

[22:39:12] <DunceCotus> however I don't think its an object like the ego
[22:39:18] <DunceCotus> its more what produces all objects
[22:39:25] <zicada> DunceCotus: i would say, concious-me and unconcious-me
[22:39:40] <zicada> that i only have a grasp on 5-10% of what makes all of me up
[22:39:41] <DunceCotus> unconscious-me doesn't make sense though
[22:40:02] <I_Am_M00t> omg zicada, i should've known
[22:40:36] <DunceCotus> zicada that implies you have some measure of the unconscious
[22:40:36] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: the two #'s mean this is like the proving grounds for the actual channel with a single #
[22:40:51] <DunceCotus> to say it makes up 90-95% of 'you'
[22:41:04] <DunceCotus> really the unconscious doesn't seem to have limits like this
[22:41:05] <zicada> DunceCotus: i think it does
[22:41:22] <DunceCotus> you can't measure the unconscious
[22:41:26] <zicada> DunceCotus: well, you have it about the concious
[22:41:41] <DunceCotus> zicada do you?
[22:41:44] <zicada> DunceCotus: and so the difference is how small that feels/appears compared to the unconcious
[22:41:50] <zicada> there are no absolute values
[22:41:59] <zicada> and we can't talk about this in objective terms
[22:42:23] <DunceCotus> well I dunno what terms we are talking then
[22:42:33] <DunceCotus> since we are talking about objectivity of these hings
[22:42:48] <zicada> objectivity and conciousness ?
[22:42:52] <DunceCotus> yes
[22:42:57] *** Joins: aototot (~teteetett@92.114.82.95)
[22:43:06] <zicada> that is generally a misnomer isn't it
[22:43:23] <DunceCotus> that is to say to have apportioning of conscious vs unconscious, this implies objective quantification
[22:43:34] <zicada> the question is how does something subjective like conciousness come from an objective physical piece of brain
[22:43:43] <DunceCotus> even if its an estimate (and can only be an estimate)
[22:43:48] <DunceCotus> to have a portion of something, its objective
[22:44:07] <zicada> i disagree
[22:44:15] <zicada> you can portion subjective ideas
[22:44:31] <DunceCotus> zicada when they are discretised yes
[22:44:33] <zicada> they would simply be furher subjective ideas about portioning
[22:44:38] <DunceCotus> so turned into objects
[22:44:46] *** Parts: allegorical (~guest@2607:fea8:33e0:65c:8152:70f2:13ce:6757) ()
[22:45:00] <zicada> maybe we disagree about the terminology
[22:45:02] <DunceCotus> the distinction between subject/object may be false
[22:45:30] <DunceCotus> but my point is there's a certain quantisation that's happening
[22:45:39] <DunceCotus> in saying this percentage is conscious vs unconscious
[22:45:53] <zicada> by subjective i mean not physical, not something everybody is either correct or incorrect about, things you can't have a view or position on, but that either are or aren't
[22:46:01] <zicada> Hume's Is/Ought
[22:46:26] <DunceCotus> but those are also not quantised
[22:46:38] <zicada> objective things can be, subjective things can't imop
[22:47:05] <zicada> but i also think conciousness can be described objectivively
[22:47:23] <DunceCotus> map and territory
[22:47:31] <zicada> it is a physical objective process that gives rice to subjective imagery and feelings and inspiration and such
[22:47:35] <zicada> rise
[22:47:45] <DunceCotus> descriptions only go so far, particularly with regard to unconscious
[22:47:56] <zicada> agreed
[22:48:24] <DunceCotus> I feel like unconscious is like the 'sinew' of being
[22:49:03] <zicada> but most objects dont require the optinal data-type
[22:49:17] <zicada> only some living beings
[22:49:29] <zicada> a subset of all living beings, clearly are concious
[22:49:54] <zicada> the distinction between things that seem clearly concious, and things that don't, is itself subjective
[22:50:21] <DunceCotus> that's why subjective may not be a coherent concept
[22:50:34] <DunceCotus> because ultimately its all subjective
[22:50:45] <zicada> depends how you define coherency i suppose, does it have to rational ?
[22:51:22] <DunceCotus> ultimately even the apparent objective facts or 'hard reality' I am faced with
[22:51:33] <DunceCotus> could be some kind of subjective idiosyncracy
[22:51:49] <DunceCotus> but in thinking like this it doesn't seem to lead anywhere
[22:52:31] <DunceCotus> zicada its more about what the concept can do, what it enables us to produce
[22:52:38] <zicada> i'm not so sure about that
[22:52:46] <voltage_> DunceCotus, what would you say to people who had more luck than you under capitalism?
[22:52:49] <zicada> wait
[22:53:22] <zicada> that hard reality can become ideosyncratic subjectivity, yeah thats the experience of doing whatever the objective thing was i guess, forming opinions about the objuective thing, etc
[22:53:28] <DunceCotus> voltage_ good for them?
[22:53:36] <voltage_> DunceCotus, be honest
[22:53:57] <DunceCotus> voltage_ I did
[22:54:04] <voltage_> tell me how you really feel about rich people
[22:54:12] <zicada> DunceCotus: for example, loving or hating math, math is objective, 2+2=4, but you can subjectively enjoy it or not enjoy it (which affects how you do a lot it turns out)
[22:54:26] <DunceCotus> voltage_ depends on how rich
[22:54:34] <I_Am_M00t> The Bez
[22:54:36] <DunceCotus> voltage_ the billionaires? fuck that
[22:54:51] <DunceCotus> I wouldn't damn them to hell but I would take them to task
[22:54:57] <voltage_> billion is just a number mate
[22:54:57] <DunceCotus> if I could get even 100ft of them
[22:55:04] <voltage_> why a billion
[22:55:24] <DunceCotus> voltage_ numbers matter a lot in our world
[22:55:34] <I_Am_M00t> $1B is a number that you can do a lot of things with
[22:55:35] <voltage_> yeah but why a billion
[22:55:41] <zicada> DunceCotus: is morality objectity or subjective in your view ?
[22:55:44] <DunceCotus> voltage_ someone having a low number in their bank account can mean threat of starvation, imprisonment, homelessness etc
[22:55:46] <zicada> *objective
[22:55:47] <voltage_> why not $800 million
[22:55:57] <voltage_> why not $100 million
[22:56:02] <voltage_> or $80 million
[22:56:14] <DunceCotus> voltage_ over 10 million and i'm frowning
[22:56:22] <I_Am_M00t> haha
[22:56:36] <DunceCotus> zicada morality may also be an incoherent concept
[22:57:17] <voltage_> DunceCotus, yeah but you know what, starvation, imprisonment, homelessness, what if you throw money at it and then it happens again?
[22:57:21] <voltage_> wouldn't be that a waste?
[22:57:27] <DunceCotus> voltage_ no
[22:57:40] <zicada> DunceCotus: i think it is incoherent
[22:57:51] <zicada> but people have opinions about whetehr it is subjective or objective
[22:57:59] <voltage_> i think it would feel like a waste, imagine you spend half your money and the issue wasn't resolved
[22:58:01] <zicada> sooo, it has to be subjective, because people have opinions about it
[22:58:02] <zicada> :)
[22:58:09] <DunceCotus> opinions are objective
[22:58:28] <zicada> obviously you could say people have "opinions" about the planet being round too
[22:58:38] <DunceCotus> voltage_ then you need to spend your money more wisely
[22:58:53] <voltage_> exactly
[22:58:53] <zicada> but that is 2+2=5 to me, its not good-faith argumentation at that point
[22:58:55] <zicada> its trolling
[22:58:58] <voltage_> you build an amazon
[22:59:04] <voltage_> i mean Amazon
[22:59:14] <voltage_> like jeff bezos
[22:59:31] <DunceCotus> zicada well we don't know the earth is round
[22:59:41] <DunceCotus> we infer it from math or observation
[22:59:52] <DunceCotus> but our vantage point is limited on that front
[23:00:10] <DunceCotus> we, as in you or I, do not have a vantage point that allows us to see the ball as it is
[23:00:50] <DunceCotus> voltage_ and amazon isn't helping homelessness
[23:01:03] <DunceCotus> it could do
[23:01:05] <DunceCotus> but it isn't
[23:01:48] <DunceCotus> it could take a reasonable hit to do so, and fix other problems (or at least get the ball rolling on fixing them), and it would still bounce back
[23:01:53] <DunceCotus> but it doesn't..
[23:02:19] <DunceCotus> voltage_ so yes I think we can be legitimate in our anger toward Bezos and his crew
[23:02:25] <DunceCotus> and shareholders
[23:02:55] <zicada> DunceCotus: would you then say that the question of wether the earth is round is subjective ? what then about 2+2 ?
[23:03:11] <zicada> they don't differ much to me
[23:03:17] <zicada> is/ought differs a lot
[23:03:20] <DunceCotus> zicada the Earth having a shape may be an incoherent concept
[23:03:52] <zicada> DunceCotus: gravity explains why all large enough things in the universe are round
[23:04:01] <zicada> DunceCotus: just like artithmetic explains 2+2
[23:04:16] <DunceCotus> zicada gravity explains it or our theory of gravity?
[23:04:16] <zicada> i dont think artithmetic is more "fundamental" than gravity
[23:04:46] <DunceCotus> keep in mind our theory of gravity is mathematical
[23:05:00] <DunceCotus> you can't have physics without first having math
[23:05:08] <zicada> our way of coming up with values for them, may be something only human brains can comprehend, or not, that is an objective question

[23:10:31] <zicada> im not sure i think you understand what it means either, but it sounds very profound
[23:10:34] <zicada> :>
[23:10:55] <DunceCotus> zicada well you know how people say god split himself up into fragments
[23:11:07] <DunceCotus> and each fragment is a particle or its conscious beings etc.
[23:11:21] <DunceCotus> whatever you want those fragments to be, God's part of everything but fragmented
[23:11:34] <zicada> DunceCotus: i dont think i ever heard that. religious people I have met and had reasonable conversations with have tended to focus on Jesus and /or Muhammed
[23:11:35] <ethereal> pantheism would support that idea
[23:11:39] <zicada> the rest have been relatively similar
[23:11:47] <zicada> but they ahve all agreed that morality is objective
[23:11:55] <zicada> there is one way to live, all other ways are sinful
[23:12:08] <DunceCotus> they are uncreative types
[23:12:10] <zicada> and to be looked down upon
[23:12:21] <zicada> i'm not so sure that holds
[23:12:31] <DunceCotus> yeah maybe not
[23:12:46] <zicada> Islam during the era Europea sucked in the dark ages were incredibly creative
[23:13:05] <DunceCotus> zicada many fundamentalist adherents to religion are pretty limited on what they can do though, creatively
[23:13:14] <zicada> even within pretty strict religious framworks.
[23:13:23] <DunceCotus> or what they can experience at in terms of art without it being sinful etc.

[23:13:43] <zicada> DunceCotus: blinded by dogma and zeal
[23:14:01] <DunceCotus> zicada what you are referring to was the "Quatria" or "Tartarian" hidden era

[23:15:52] <DunceCotus> zicada you have to understand that much of the history prior to our modern era is distorted to fuk
[23:16:03] <DunceCotus> they added 1000 years to the calendar for starters
[23:16:07] <zicada> oh I'm plenty aware
[23:16:27] <zicada> I'm interested in historical facts about biblical sources etc
[23:16:44] <DunceCotus> Rome may have fallen as early as 500 years ago
[23:16:45] <zicada> relatively common concept there
[23:17:06] <zicada> Yeah 455 i think is a fair number if you had to pick one

[23:18:06] <DunceCotus> it was part of a unified religion with other faiths

[23:18:19] <zicada> DunceCotus: but led on and given more gravtias by Islam

[23:19:33] <DunceCotus> we can only really say so much about history that far back
[23:19:38] <zicada> you're probably familar with Spanish history, lots of it happened in soutern Spain prior to the reconquista
[23:19:40] <DunceCotus> its been too distorted

[23:21:31] <DunceCotus> Julius Ceasar may have = Jesus Christ
[23:21:32] <zicada> pretty much the same timeperiod
[23:21:50] <zicada> so how do the sources differ such that we trust the ones about Julius Caesar more than the ones about Jesus
[23:21:58] <DunceCotus> this is how distorted history has become

[23:23:24] <DunceCotus> zicada and its still going on

[23:39:32] <DunceCotus> not for its accuracy in recording
[23:39:39] <zicada> yeha
[23:40:31] <zicada> the idea that you can have a subjective emotion and transmit it to the reader, the more skilled the writer, often subjectively, the more likely the recipient recives a "true" representation of what the author had in mind
[23:40:52] <zicada> eg feels what they felt as they wrote it
[23:41:33] <DunceCotus> it may be less of what is written but what else is imbued in its writing

[23:42:36] <DunceCotus> but can we extend this further.. what if my human isn't yours?
[23:42:41] <zicada> but our shared idea of redness still allows for each individual to identity the same rex
[23:42:43] <DunceCotus> my rock, my pencil etc.
[23:42:44] <zicada> red
[23:42:56] <zicada> its red to the society you live in
[23:43:33] <zicada> internal representation is irrelevant, thats why we have this abstraction in the first place, to agree on things
[23:43:45] <zicada> or disagree
[23:43:47] <DunceCotus> yes
[23:43:55] <DunceCotus> but it is interesting when we disagree too
[23:44:02] <DunceCotus> like how much of red a thing is
[23:44:10] <DunceCotus> or how someone reacts to red
[23:44:14] <zicada> we ought to push culture more in the direaction of that idea
[23:44:25] <zicada> that being wrong is equally interesting because you update your internal model of reality
[23:44:30] <zicada> you have more information, which is good
[23:44:40] <ethereal> is the dress blue and black or white and gold
[23:44:55] <zicada> that being wrong has less of a cultural or societal hit
[23:44:58] <DunceCotus> ethereal blue and gold!
[23:45:07] <ethereal> i can see that i suppose!
[23:45:20] <DunceCotus> no, that's the objective Correct answer ;)
[23:45:23] <ethereal> but that's a nice example
[23:45:26] <zicada> more information is always better than less information, even when you're wrong, you're less likely to be wrong less time because you have more information
[23:45:29] <zicada> :)
[23:45:35] <ethereal> no cause, both are right!
[23:45:40] <zicada> *next time
[23:45:40] <ethereal> somehow, just like the yanny/laurel
[23:45:47] <DunceCotus> ethereal yep
[23:46:16] <ethereal> how our vessels for perception may not align, results-wise, but it not be from a place of deception
[23:46:23] <DunceCotus> zicada more information is always better?
[23:46:33] <zicada> DunceCotus: i think so
[23:46:50] <zicada> DunceCotus: it allows one to update ones models and make better decisions
[23:47:13] <DunceCotus> zicada can you have too much information?
[23:47:22] <zicada> even when its subjectively "bad news", it can obviously then be worse in the short term, but you
[23:47:30] <zicada> 're likely still better off in the long run
[23:47:35] <zicada> DunceCotus: no
[23:47:37] <DunceCotus> hmm
[23:47:47] <zicada> that would require a "brain-maximum"
[23:47:57] <zicada> but brains dont really function like hard-drives
[23:48:03] <zicada> theres no hard limit apparently
[23:48:10] <DunceCotus> brainses
[23:48:13] <zicada> if you like learning you can learn till you die
[23:48:25] <DunceCotus> zicada death is the hard limit then?
[23:48:25] <zicada> or in our case until the singularity :D
[23:48:38] <zicada> except tech cases
[23:48:51] <DunceCotus> singularitea anyone?
[23:49:22] *** Joins: garip (~garip@159.146.21.137)
[23:49:40] <zicada> i view human anatomy as entirely hardware, nothing special in particular, all pieces of matter can in theory be concious if they're complex enough, brains aren't special in that regard, they're just the only structures we're aware of that are complex enough to somehow "host" conciousness, or give rise to
[23:50:19] <DunceCotus> what if even the wooden floorboards of a house are conscious
[23:50:23] <zicada> i had a supermassiveblackhole coffee this morning, i'll pass on the singulariy-tea, you never know what interactions might occur
[23:50:27] <zicada> :>
[23:50:37] <DunceCotus> fair ploy
[23:50:55] <voltage> DunceCotus, what would you say to a rabbit eaten by a hawk?
[23:51:02] <DunceCotus> zicada panpsychism?
[23:51:18] <DunceCotus> voltage im sorry that happened
[23:51:36] <zicada> DunceCotus: no, because no structures other than brains known are capable of it
[23:51:48] <zicada> DunceCotus: i dont think rocks are sentient or capable of conciousness
[23:51:53] <zicada> i think rocks are a human concept
[23:51:55] <voltage> DunceCotus, i think rabbits should change the system they live in, airborne predators are OP
[23:52:02] <DunceCotus> zicada well have you asked the rock?
[23:52:16] <zicada> its all about complexity for me
[23:52:21] <DunceCotus> voltage if rabbits could maybe they would
[23:52:39] <zicada> which means a computer can in theory be concious in the same manner a human can
[23:52:42] <DunceCotus> zicada perhaps there are variations of consciousness
[23:52:47] <zicada> or any orginic or other thing that is complex eniugh
[23:52:52] <zicada> but that isnt panpshycism
[23:52:53] <DunceCotus> human consciousness comes with an ego
[23:53:01] <DunceCotus> but maybe there is conscious awareness without ego
[23:53:07] <DunceCotus> just kind of.. experience
[23:53:14] <zicada> because panpsychism ascribes conciousness to any matter, and wants it to be more of a constant thing that is part of reality
[23:53:44] <DunceCotus> zicada sure
[23:54:04] <DunceCotus> in a way I agree with you but I am not sure
[23:54:21] <zicada> i think life on earth is likely pretty rare, and we are probably alone within the narrow window we exist. The universe is very old, Humans just showed up a second ago in Universe-time, its hard for anyone else to be around and have epic spaceships at the same time
[23:54:50] <DunceCotus> life on earth seems pretty constnat
[23:54:53] <DunceCotus> *constant
[23:54:56] <zicada> yeah, to us
[23:55:02] <DunceCotus> even if that 'life' is seemingly inorganics
[23:55:09] <zicada> but to use time moves very slowly because we are tuned to the lifetime of a single human
[23:55:29] <zicada> though it stretched a lot in the last 200 years, its not going to keep streching unless we come up with some pretty nutty tech
[23:55:49] <zicada> in principle we can live forever, should we if given the opurtunity ?
[23:55:50] <DunceCotus> zicada I think there are others
[23:55:59] <DunceCotus> variations of humans perhaps
[23:56:02] <DunceCotus> 'aliens'
[23:56:02] <zicada> or is it egoistic to "defy" evolution like this
[23:56:14] <zicada> i think so too
[23:56:17] <zicada> but not within reach
[23:56:20] <I_Am_M00t> if free will is an illusion, will we have a say in the matter?
[23:56:25] <zicada> while humanity plays out
[23:56:28] * I_Am_M00t breaks everything
[23:56:29] <zicada> if there were we would know
[23:56:44] <DunceCotus> zicada I think they are 'incredibly close but incredibly far'
[23:56:55] <zicada> we would be very aware, we wouldnt rely on light-issues on photos and video footage, we'd be in contact
[23:56:56] <arryana> that's a big leap, zicada.  like an ant claiming there are no polar bears, because 'they would know'
[23:57:50] <DunceCotus> zicada well maybe in order for them to get here that would open a can of worms
[23:57:53] <zicada> arryana: im saying humanity's existence is such a quick blimp in the general longer state or reality, that its hard for enyone to have the chance to have spaceships to get here exactly now
[23:58:08] <zicada> arryana: its more likely they were here a few million years in either direction
[23:58:09] <DunceCotus> they'd be responsible for our ingratiation into the fold
[23:58:10] * arryana shrugs
[23:58:20] <arryana> don't think i agree with you, but i don't see any point arguing it
[23:58:22] <zicada> than exactly this window of what, 8000 years give or take so far
[23:58:34] <arryana> what makes you so sure they aren't here now?
[23:58:51] <zicada> its a swimmingly small percentage of the time civilzations may have existed in the universe
[23:59:18] <arryana> that's one way of looking at it.
[23:59:21] <DunceCotus> zicada the US govt just released a report on UAPs.. apparently they can't identify them, or explain some of their behavior
[23:59:25] <zicada> its more likely that there are more of us than just us because we exist, absolutely, but we have no data besides that
[23:59:42] <DunceCotus> zicada that seems to point to 'the aliens are already here' hypothesis
[23:59:50] <DunceCotus> but that doesn't mean they're talkative with us (yet?)
[23:59:55] <arryana> i find it impossible to believe that this planet is the only meaningful life.  universe is a big place, and that seems like a ridiculously random event to happen just once.
