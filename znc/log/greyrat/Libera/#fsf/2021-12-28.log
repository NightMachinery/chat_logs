[00:00:22] <epony> science is not "philosophy" of "legal" misreadings
[00:00:35] <White_Flame> operating systems are not science
[00:00:40] <natewrench123456> it sounds like experimentation
[00:00:51] <White_Flame> they are labeled products on the market
[00:01:12] <White_Flame> and individual projects of arbitrary depth, complexity, coverage, etc
[00:01:17] <epony> obviously, there is computer science
[00:01:32] <epony> operating systems are a discipline of it
[00:01:53] <natewrench123456> OSes are a staple of human engineering
[00:01:58] <epony> there are classes and types of operating systems, but none of that is opinions and misreadings
[00:02:09] <White_Flame> computer science is not a "science" specifically
[00:02:18] <epony> a couple of applications are not an operating system
[00:02:19] <White_Flame> neither really is mathematics
[00:02:31] <natewrench123456> software "patents" are not really patents
[00:02:38] <White_Flame> this is why we have things like "STEM" and not _just_ "science"
[00:02:50] <natewrench123456> Science Tech English Math
[00:02:53] <natewrench123456> ELA
[00:03:09] <White_Flame> *engineering
[00:03:53] <epony> yes, computer science includes the electrical engineering field, it's a division into it
[00:04:05] <White_Flame> natewrench123456: at least in the USA, "software" patents are patents on a device that does something :-P
[00:04:11] <White_Flame> electrical engineering is NOT computer related
[00:04:30] <epony> GNU is not an operating system, it's a collection of licenses and utilities (programs, applications)
[00:04:35] <White_Flame> usually, it's focused more on the analog portion of things, which hardware engineering does borrow from at high speed
[00:04:53] <epony> it's a movement and a software publisher, a political and legal unit of application distribution
[00:04:57] <White_Flame> but computer hardware is generally under the "computer engineering" label
[00:05:02] <epony> it's NOT an operating system, period
[00:05:07] <natewrench123456> I thought GNU was the main OS and linux is its kernel
[00:05:07] <epony> learn your basics
[00:05:13] <epony> noe

[00:05:50] <epony> it's a userland, application set, toolchains, a lot of things, but not an operating system, much more an operating environment, one that is portable
[00:05:50] <natewrench123456> Technically Windows isnt anymore an OS than GNU is, it has a collection of licenses and utilites
[00:06:06] <epony> White_Flame, you're not very interesting either ;-)

[00:06:55] <White_Flame> in any case, at the start of this I hadn't noticed it was epony, but this degrades past useful conversation quickly
[00:07:01] <natewrench123456> epony, did you score a C++ in Programming?
[00:07:22] <epony> scoring is for "sports"?
[00:07:59] <epony> what is this verbiage.. are you new to online talks
[00:08:14] <natewrench123456> I was making a joke humor, C++ as in grading
[00:08:21] <White_Flame> come on, you don't even know what "science" means, stop trying to correct others

[00:10:27] <epony> we can't replicate incorrect opinions

[03:41:06] <epony> DiffieHellman, I didn't see anyone saying that, maybe you're misreading things.
[03:41:59] <epony> GNU is a userland utilities and applications, not an operating system, get your reading glasses.
[03:42:25] <epony> (otherwise, it's talking asses)
[03:45:26] <epony> it it was isf saying who to block, you would not have anyone like Stallman and many others, and the zealots would be manifesting in front of the loonie application store
[03:47:12] <DiffieHellman> GNU is an operating system which contains userland utilities and applications.
[03:47:30] <epony> s/system/environment/
[03:47:40] <DiffieHellman> Arguing that it's not an OS is like arguing Unix wasn't an OS.
[03:47:48] <epony> wrong analogy
[03:48:11] <DiffieHellman> It's a pretty good analogy as GNU intended to replace the Unix OS with a Unix-like OS.
[03:48:16] <epony> no, it's shitty
[03:48:20] <DiffieHellman> Please cease your wrongness
[03:48:43] <epony> also GNU calls itself not an UNIX, so if UNIX is a classic OS, GNU not being UNIX, is also not an OS.
[03:48:59] <epony> don't please, you're saying wrong dubmclaims
[03:49:13] <DiffieHellman> GNU not being Unix reffers to not being from the same codebase and not being proprietary malware.
[03:49:17] <epony> because there are components missing
[03:49:27] <epony> read the article I quoted.
[03:49:33] <DiffieHellman> Which ones?
[03:49:54] <epony> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system#Components

[05:07:33] <natewrench123456> i guess we cant go any further otherwise its too strong of a copyleft, so I guess just omit the or any later version clause because there's never going to be a GPLv4 unless copyright laws change
[05:08:27] <natewrench123456> but still the FSF could make things whole by allowing FSF/OSI approved licenses to be usable in the GPL because the FSF controls where the market will head

[05:14:11] <epony> obviously FSF does not go against commercial legal system, it prolongs the copyright legal framework to software
[05:14:24] <epony> and is part of that commerce
[05:14:29] <DiffieHellman> They don't dare, as the FSF will come at them and won't give up.
[05:15:22] <DiffieHellman> Some patent troll tried to get money off gnome, but they soon gave up once gnome got ready to kick their ass legally.
[05:15:27] <epony> (provides an alternative to the commerce only sector, so it does not get riled up against social interest as monopoly dominant market and public services, however it does get the international monopolistic position, the US commercial forced software and forced services)
[05:15:42] <natewrench123456> I suspect Congress will extend copyright terms or make them even more restrictive in 2024 when steamboat willy is set to expire
[05:15:52] <DiffieHellman> Of course.
[05:15:59] <epony> FSF is powerless compared to big business, it also gets sponsored by said businesses, so is also dependendent on them.
[05:16:20] <DiffieHellman> The FSF doesn't get much funding from big business, most is from members
[05:16:22] <epony> it can just pleade "right to existence" and it's granted that regardless of any court ruling
[05:16:22] <natewrench123456> thats ironic though the FSF being supported by the corporations they despise
[05:16:45] <DiffieHellman> Many corps pulled funding from the FSF, and they didn't blink
[05:16:53] <epony> who funds Linux, and does any of the Linux funding go to the FSF funding?
[05:17:24] <DiffieHellman> A bunch of proprietary comapnies fund the Linux foundation. No funds from the Linux foundatin goes to the FSF
[05:17:33] <epony> you see, it's connected and goes through the more "susceptible" and "subservient" to control the more "free" and "independent"
[05:17:33] <natewrench123456> Fair use is still an issue though i mean there should be a form for websites to hand out to people to write down everything that way if a dmca does come their way they are ready to fight
[05:18:19] <DiffieHellman> A lot of fair use things are still DMCA'd
[05:18:27] <epony> so historically, can you prove that the FSF was solely funded by the government and the people who are subjects of that government, and not the businesses and the legal system that services the businesses?
[05:18:50] <natewrench123456> a Fair Use Checklist
[05:19:02] <DiffieHellman> Historically, the FSF was funded by the free software community and not the government or businesses.
[05:19:07] <natewrench123456> epony, well the IRS lists the FSF as a 501c3
[05:19:12] <epony> technically, it should not matter who funds free software development, the sad part is that government does not fund it
[05:19:33] <DiffieHellman> No matter who funds the FSF, they won't be swayed.
[05:19:34] <epony> since government is ran by businesses
[05:19:36] <natewrench123456> taxpayer dollars do not go to the FSF
[05:19:53] <DiffieHellman> Taxpayer dollars go to that proprietary software.
[05:20:12] <epony> it's considered an entirely proprietary and commercial government model (country / state / continent) operation
[05:20:24] <DiffieHellman> Via methods that breach procurement laws in many cases.
[05:20:41] <epony> should law system have anything to do with software again?
[05:20:52] <natewrench123456> well we do have the right to first sale
[05:21:01] <DiffieHellman> Yes, as you need to law system to enforce copyright.
[05:21:06] <epony> (answer: no, but it is encumbered because of commerce grabbing free software by the throat via laws and financial regulation)
[05:21:07] <DiffieHellman> *the
[05:21:27] <natewrench123456> if we didnt have the law or copyright, we would have to rely on contracts then
[05:21:30] <epony> what does copyright have to do with a software program?
[05:21:46] <DiffieHellman> All software programs are automatically covered by copyright
[05:21:46] <epony> (answer: nothing, it wants to participate in revenue and taxation)
[05:22:00] <epony> so you have 0 freedoms?
[05:22:08] <DiffieHellman> Without a free software license, the software is therefore automatically proprietary,
[05:22:28] <natewrench123456> epony, in a sick way we only have privledges since every amendment has exceptions
[05:22:55] <epony> (answer: yes, we have some 4 freedoms, but as we operate under a non-free economic model, it is correct, nothing is free and open, it's just accessible and provided for the dependents)
[05:23:52] <natewrench123456> maybe using freedom software / open source stopped pirating dead in its tracks
[05:23:54] <epony> software is free if you say it does not care about copyright and can not be subjected to copyright law?
[05:24:39] <epony> (answer: that's irrelevant, software was always free and will forever be free, as it is human knowledge and is reimplemented by humans just as science and innovation and invention)
[05:25:54] <epony> in the non-free (slavery) world, you have to be given some rights (liberties) otherwise you have none and are subject to captivity and abuse?

[05:26:58] <epony> (answer: yes, in the free world you have all rights and you're free, since you're a program and can not do anything without people who apply human rules on their usage and relations)
[05:27:22] <natewrench123456> epony, but you have to make those explicit or implicit in some kind of constitution
[05:27:32] <epony> yes, for people

[05:29:02] <natewrench123456> if the end user who isnt a copyright holder has no funds to go after violators or violations then no case, its not illegal if the other person cant afford the lawsuit
[05:29:07] <epony> programs are not-objects, they are ethics and principles and recipes and information exchanged between machines
[05:31:35] <epony> generally applied technology can be completely non-commercial and provided by governments and education institutions freely to the people, as a gift so they are educated and can participate with the knowledge and information in a modern human progress
[05:31:40] <natewrench123456> epony, if AI are not human and therefore have no rights, then if an AI creates a program does it have copyrights or does the creator of that AI have the copyrights
[05:32:26] <epony> programs do not create programs, they are created by people, so people created programs that generate data sequences as output
[05:32:55] <natewrench123456> even if software were to leave the copyright realm naturally, without the source code its as good as useless
[05:33:23] <epony> people can not use human laws on their creations that are not human or objects, if they give them away to other people as gifts in favour of the entire humanity
[05:34:21] <epony> it's simply illogical to have that and can not be enforced and validated, without proprietary control systems for the blocks of data, that would be non-free then
[05:35:01] <natewrench123456> if the linux kernel was written by non-humans it would have been considered exploitation
[05:35:17] <epony> programs are data, that can be processed, depending on its qualities with more or less control

[05:36:47] <epony> so people create computational automatic systems to assist in that
[05:37:07] <epony> with time these become accessible to larger groups of people (classes of people)
[05:37:41] <epony> they then choose to use the computers with their own data, you can't stop that, otherwise people will not use those computer systems and build others that can
[05:38:41] <epony> it's game over for "proprietary" data and "proprietary" science every since the technical invention of communication between the people
[05:39:04] <natewrench123456> epony, the future is non-proprietary then
[05:39:11] <epony> that's entirely dogmatic religious-monarchic model of education and invention, and has been replaced and obsoleted
[05:39:15] <epony> yes
[05:39:17] <epony> correct
[05:39:36] <epony> the future is, and I think you know the past was too and present is as well
[05:39:57] <epony> despite what some "commercial legal system" claims
[05:40:35] <epony> that is why they use teh "services" model, not teh "instructions" (data) model

[05:42:58] <natewrench123456> ibm was right... there is no money in software
[05:43:16] <epony> IBM was forced to unbundle, by the US government
[05:43:26] <natewrench123456> is that why they bought red hat?
[05:43:29] <epony> which created the software sales industry

[05:44:59] <epony> governments regulate such things, only when it is in the interest of creating business services, not in the interest of the consumers or peoplee, so they allow 50 year runs of commercial exploitation before they move their bureau-cratic model slighly, to create more competitive again unfair systems

[05:46:09] <epony> it does this only for "itself" and its own "operations", where the government is a proprietary business model of economic control

[05:46:35] <natewrench123456> how is the gov't proprietary when whatever it releases is public domain
[05:46:39] <epony> cause you live in that system.. and it's unavoidable and taxes you via consumption and device sales
[05:47:10] <natewrench123456> i think taxes are protection money like mobs protected stores in exchange for a fee

[05:48:28] <epony> taxes are supposed to be used in the public good, instead they are awarded to companies so they get started and then provide goods and services for which the people pay, and the government gets paid by people, and funded by corporations for crafting the laws in favour of the businesses exploiting the people
[05:48:44] <epony> at least, programs are free regardless of any license
[05:48:52] <natewrench123456> thats crony capitalism

[05:51:02] <epony> the programs however, are just data that can be used as instructions, but not anything like a traded good, they are a small piece of service that can be exchanged and shared freely between people, for the cost of the exchange of data on electric and magnetic system (cheaply, once you have the communication system)
[05:51:26] <natewrench123456> Yes in terms of value they are intangible
[05:51:32] <epony> so not having to go through a post office, but having your own post office on your communicator device, is your real free capacity
[05:51:43] <epony> you still paid in the system

[05:53:14] <natewrench123456> Actually I could use freenet or zeronet
[05:53:26] <epony> there is no difference between you and a business other than access to finances through the banking system
[05:53:54] <epony> so, it's the financial system that puts the prongs on the neck of free software and the legal system is its servant
[05:53:56] <natewrench123456> Well businesses have funds to fight and negotiate unlike individuals
[05:54:20] <epony> yeah, people give money to businesses and banks they scream "but they abuse us"
[05:54:44] <epony> cause there is no "regulation" and "control" of that relation
[05:54:45] <natewrench123456> Crypto turns us into our own banks
[05:54:54] <epony> crypto is not that
[05:55:11] <epony> it's just "pretended" to hide what you're talking about
[05:55:34] <epony> so, it's partial secrecy, nothing more
[05:55:57] <natewrench123456> Hmm I guess anything that leaves our domicile is out of our control
[05:56:52] <epony> it can be partial confidentiality and partial authenticity, but it's not an independent economic and financial system, it's a communications network to send orders and "execute" them without the participation of the official economic and government systems, so it's not moving goods in teh public, but criminal interests only
[05:57:18] <epony> yes, anything that gets out of your own control is the control of the other people and businesses
[05:57:32] <natewrench123456> So crypto will never be a currency

[05:58:09] <natewrench123456> Heh
[05:58:26] <epony> crypto is used for exchanges of information between banks for a long time
[05:58:40] <natewrench123456> Like wire transfers
[05:58:44] <epony> and the lines were previously guaranteed by the post office and the government with its military and police
[05:58:46] <epony> yes
[05:59:18] <natewrench123456> Who guarantees then now
[05:59:27] <epony> out of that control, is nothing, but "exchanges of data" and someone deciding to do something as a result of that, like trading post stamps for murder / drugs
[06:00:08] <epony> the non-government issued currency and bonds are not guaranteed, so have no value
[06:00:31] <epony> it's hard to give the government ones value, the out of that system have less chances
[06:01:31] <epony> it's an artificial trade of "data" with 0 value
[06:01:48] <epony> for intent based "actions" but not "goods"
[06:02:07] <natewrench123456> So why was crypto invented or created
[06:02:34] <epony> to give criminals access to do exchanges without being stopped by governments immediately
[06:02:49] <epony> the governments have control of the electric systems and can shut down everything
[06:03:09] <epony> so they have control, and can force people to revert these or manipulate these
[06:03:32] <epony> also, it's a project with government participation and control

[16:25:03] <kompowiec> there are exceptions, such as pirc.pl which supports the history

[16:29:43] <AIM[m]> Oh
[16:29:46] <kompowiec> i also have XMPP but his community is lower than matrix
[16:29:53] <fossdev> but it is more federated

[16:30:21] <kompowiec> most of the MUC XMPP are Germanic channels.
[16:30:23] <AIM[m]> I mean "Lower???"

[16:33:16] <kompowiec> aa no SPOF but p2p
[16:34:02] <kompowiec> it isn't so bad but then there is the same problem as in IRC, no  history. 
[16:35:19] <AIM[m]> Why ya need history!
[16:35:27] <AIM[m]> History is against privacy!
[16:36:28] <frumious> IRC is very much not privacy oriented
[16:37:03] <frumious> it's an interesting problem: how to provide authentic history in distributed chat.
[16:37:39] <kompowiec> matrix does the same as usenet
[16:37:40] <frumious> trivial, you could ask peers, "give me your logs since I was disconnected" but then how to guard against spoofed responses?
[16:37:56] <kompowiec> synchronize between all matrix servers
[16:38:19] <M6piz7wk[m]> frumious: Federated! Boo distribution!
[16:38:19] <M6piz7wk[m]> and simply those get stored on homeservers and fetched on demand if the user has sufficient permission to see them
[16:38:42] <M6piz7wk[m]> kompowiec: lol no
[16:39:01] <frumious> I suppose all peers could be queried and then a "vote" taken based on log similarity 
[16:39:01] <M6piz7wk[m]> frumious: Homeservers!
[16:39:24] <M6piz7wk[m]> smh
[16:39:29] <frumious> timestamps would pose problems in that similarity comparison
[16:39:42] <kompowiec> M6piz7wk[m], no? this is why matrix is considered a metadata dizaster.
[16:40:20] <frumious> similarity would work well for larger channels but become progressively easier to spoof as the channel size reduced

[18:20:36] <isf> cant*
[18:20:56] <isf> only with free software you can have privacy and phones need nonfree software

[18:21:41] <fossdev> F*#$ phones
[18:21:50] <fossdev> I know they are non free
[18:22:03] <fossdev> They are trash for me
[18:22:27] <Kaiod> Look ISF, I can already see that you follow an extremist point of view in the defense of the Free Software idea. But who exactly do you intend to achieve with this? Knowledge is good, and I am glad that you defend this idea very well, but in fact, quoting only RMS and rebutting any and all ideas, without any solid argumentation, is redundant.
[18:23:05] <fossdev> 7,99Kaiod99,99: what phone u use
[18:23:08] <isf> redundant is know what is free software and run nonfree software
[18:23:36] <fossdev> Its replicant
[18:23:45] <Kaiod> fossdev: Yes, for you it can be. But it is precisely this approach that makes the idea so unheard of.
[18:24:03] <isf> replicant is fully free as in freedom in the first computer
[18:24:09] <isf> but the second computer 
[18:24:15] <isf> the computer of communication

[18:24:35] <isf> thats the reason RMS dont use cellphone

[18:24:57] <Kaiod> fossdev: Actually, I don't use phones at all. Sometimes I use the samsung for some things, I intend to buy the Librem, but the price of the dollar is high.
[18:25:21] <fossdev> But pinephone
[18:25:30] <fossdev> Or ubuntu touch
[18:25:46] <fossdev> At least it is better than android
[18:25:48] <isf> both pinephone and ubuntu touch have nonfree software
[18:26:03] <fossdev> isf: only firmware
[18:26:07] <isf> that is software
[18:26:15] <isf> are nonfree software

[18:26:59] <isf> you can know

[18:27:05] <isf> non freedom software
[18:27:23] <isf> privacy is impossible without free software
[18:27:27] <Kaiod> isf: But it does exist, not everybody uses and will use free software. The idea that EVERYTHING IS NONFREE makes no sense to the person you are explaining it to. You must approach it in a more educational way, RMS brings good philosophies, but you must know how to fit it into a didactic context.
[18:27:37] <isf> that is false
[18:28:07] <fossdev> 7,99Kaiod:99,99 100% right

[18:29:49] <isf> only with free software you can understand what happen in your computing
[18:30:05] <isf> with nonfree software, like phones for example they  always are lisening you

[19:25:08] <Kaiod> On the subject of idols, it is always good to remember that the dependence on relating a person to something does not collaborate in collective education. 
[19:25:09] <Kaiod> The philosophy is what should be followed, not a specific person. RMS is an activist, a person who does good work in free software, he deserves respect, but should not be idolized.
[19:25:09] <Kaiod> This disqualifies the idea, because you centralize the whole ideal in one person, and this makes the effort of the other activists and collaborators into nothing, and this does not reflect the idea of the philosophy.

[21:44:50] <Kaiod> <kompowiec> "However, it is obliged to..." <- Well, I can't tell you precisely, since I don't understand how they could pick up any information in this case. If they don't have the information, there is no way to cooperate, everything is encrypted, there are no logs, and the other minimal data is deleted after a period of time. 
[21:44:51] <Kaiod> Therefore, I think there is no way they could cooperate. But I will try to find out what they would do in this situation, and how they can act, and as soon as I get the answer I will let you know.
[21:45:21] <kompowiec>  it doesn't matter in the slightest.
[21:46:11] <gothicserpent> kompowiec: it's not possible to get the data if it's not existent.

[21:48:20] <kompowiec> it certainly did not help.
[21:49:00] <Kaiod> kompowiec: I trust Riseup, because it is a collective of people like us. People who defend their agendas, who fight for social justice, and in the end, the courts wanted to stop them from doing what they wanted to do, because they were against the government or something like that. I trust them and see that they do a good job, based on the idea of what they have been through. They want to help, they make tools available, and collectives all over the
[21:49:01] <Kaiod> world use them, and there has never been anything that RiseUp hasn't done to stop any government intervention.

[22:11:12] <zleap> cool i'll take a look
[22:12:23] <Kaiod> GnuPG is part of the GNU Project and received major funding from the German government in 1999 (https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Bundesregierung-foerdert-Open-Source-24110.html)
[22:12:57] <zleap> that could explain why the flyer for emailselfdefence is in both english and german 
[22:13:32] <Kaiod> zleap: Yes, this explains very well. 
[22:14:40] <junebug> So they've been funded by the German government for a long time? Do you have an English article with this info?
[22:16:38] <zleap> i don't i just have the e-mail self defense flyer
[22:16:56] <zleap> which I can never spell properly due to UK/US English confusion
[22:17:26] <Kaiod> junebug: I can look it up, but the link is from the government
