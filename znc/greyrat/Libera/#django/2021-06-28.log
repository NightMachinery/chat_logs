[14:25:33] <FunkyBob> do what, wallbroken ?
[14:25:58] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: well, in the template i want to add some nested "if" statements, the first one is:
[14:26:11] <wallbroken> check if the current user has ordered the item
[14:26:28] <FunkyBob> why in the template?
[14:26:31] <wallbroken> so the if must check if it is in the ordered_users m2m
[14:26:42] *** Joins: serghei (~egrep@user/serghei)
[14:26:55] <wallbroken> because i need to show the css with "ordered" "unavailable" "sold out"
[14:27:12] <wallbroken> and to discriminate between those states, i need to use some if
[14:27:13] <FunkyBob> then I suggest you add a method to the model to do the 'work' part... or a custom filter
[14:27:18] <FunkyBob> or annotate it
[14:27:48] <wallbroken> good idea
[14:28:01] <wallbroken> but i should use the "if" in the template anyway
[14:28:07] <FunkyBob> looking up a m2m is not something you want to do in a tempalte
[14:28:11] <FunkyBob> sure
[14:29:05] <wallbroken> it's good to create a generic view function that passing an item i want to check, it returns it state?
[14:29:22] <wallbroken> i'm not sure how to design it
[14:29:38] <FunkyBob> no
[14:29:47] <FunkyBob> why a view function?  and why generic?
[14:30:22] <wallbroken> because i need to use it in more than one point
[14:30:32] <FunkyBob> which "it"?
[14:30:33] <wallbroken> i need to use it in the minicart, in the main pager
[14:30:55] <wallbroken> "it" is the state
[14:30:58] <wallbroken> of each item
[14:31:15] <FunkyBob> too vague
[14:31:17] <FunkyBob> what "state"?
[14:31:22] <wallbroken> i need to process each item to know if it's available, sold out, ordered
[14:31:36] <FunkyBob> ok
[14:31:47] <wallbroken> state: 1) available item, 2) sold out item, 3) ordered item, 4) delivered item
[14:31:55] <FunkyBob> then you might want to add that as a custom manager or queryset method.. IF you can work out an annotate to answer the question

[14:59:40] <duki> Hello! I'm a little confused about the point of "apps" in Django in the context of a single project. I understand writing open-source apps that provide some functionality, but I'm confused why I would ever want closed-source project to have more than one app.In that context, it seems impossible for any app to not touch at least one other app's
[14:59:40] <duki> models. If it were possible to completely decouple them, then why not just make separate projects and go the microservices route? On the other hand, I feel like as soon as one app imports anything from another app, the "app" abstraction breaks down

[15:02:53] <duki> I'm just confused about the benefits over just having normal Python packages
[15:03:26] <mattmcc> Django apps are, essentially normal Python packages. They just have a structure Django looks for when it comes to things like models, templates, tags, etc.
[15:04:28] <duki> mattmcc and having coupling between them is totally okay?
[15:04:35] <duki> up to a point, of course

[16:42:42] <tm007> Also, from my experience, for microservice architectures, they are very useful as well.
[16:42:57] <FunkyBob> so one of the examples I give in django-nap is for a login view
[16:42:58] <najtsirk> We don't have microservices.
[16:43:04] <FunkyBob> dealing with CSRF tokens, and so on
[16:43:05] <FunkyBob> https://django-nap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html#case-2-login-view
[16:43:23] <FunkyBob> the idea is your client app makes a GET request to check if you're logged in... and in doing so is forced a CSRF token
[16:44:02] <najtsirk> Actually we have a global metadata GET request and getting cookies (CSRF, session) from there.
[16:44:11] <FunkyBob> if the response shows you're not logged in, make a POST to log in
[16:44:12] <najtsirk> This one is done before the client is rendered

[16:44:44] <tm007> I struggle to see the problem as well.
[16:44:47] <najtsirk> The only thing that was missing is the json endpoints for authentication

[16:45:26] <FunkyBob> [as does my example]
[16:45:37] <tm007> cool
[16:46:59] <najtsirk> FunkyBob: also one question - there is a lot of suggestions that token based authentication should be used with rest endpoints. But I actually (for our case) don't see any point as we want to keep state on the server, we want to store authentication identifier in the cookie (not local storage).
[16:47:11] <najtsirk> So session authentication should be good, right?
[16:47:26] <FunkyBob> people who say "all rest endpoints should use token auth" are wrong

[19:30:49] *** Quits: serghei (~egrep@user/serghei) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[19:31:58] <moldy> also, be careful with the term "digit"
[19:32:27] <Crassus> moldy: Why???
[19:32:42] <moldy> Crassus: because it's not well-defined
[19:32:53] <mad_moses> GinFuyou: in any order. Thats the problem
[19:33:10] <mad_moses> moldy: I mean evertyhing between 0-9
[19:33:51] <mad_moses> => aaaa1aa11aaaa11 should be a match
[19:35:30] <moldy> mad_moses: i probably wouldn't use a regex
[19:35:53] <Crassus> moldy: Umm... in English, it'd just be zero to nine. There's unicode complications I guess. I kind of think it's a very well defined category though tbh, not trying to be argumentative, but yeah... usually numbers are seperate characters in all the languages I am aware of.
[19:36:08] <GinFuyou> How about, (?:\D*\d\D*){5}, does it miss something?
[19:36:11] <Crassus> moldy: Why????
[19:36:46] <moldy> Crassus: you're in for a surprise if you use python APIs like str.isdigit() or shorthands in various regex dialects which consider more than 0-9 to be digits
[19:37:18] <mad_moses> moldy: I want to use filter and query my database.
[19:37:19] <b-rex> lets say i have Q(data__anniversary_date__icontains='somedata') - i want the user to pass in data_anniversary_date=somedata as a query param. how can i get the string data_anniversary_date translated from a string to the code Q(data__anniversary_date__icontains ?
[19:37:35] <Crassus> moldy: Umm, like encoding issues?
[19:38:02] *** Joins: stabler (~stabler@87-50-3-146-cable.dk.customer.tdc.net)
[19:38:12] <GinFuyou> Also, yeah there more characters for digits in unicode
[19:38:35] <Crassus> moldy: I honestly don't know. I think everyone nowadays uses Hindu-Arabic numerals (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) to represent numbers.
[19:39:00] <moldy> Crassus: nope
[19:39:11] <GinFuyou> Yeah, nope
[19:39:18] <moldy> Crassus: \d in python regexes for example matches digits in various scripts
[19:39:34] <Crassus> GinFuyou: Yep... like Chinese and Japanese
[19:39:52] <Crassus> moldy: Would those user not know what a 2 means though?
[19:40:06] <mad_moses> GinFuyou: Thank you: But what you wrote is exactle 5 digits. I wanted minimum 5 digites but I modfied it and it works well to: (?:\D*\d\D*){5,}
[19:40:10] <moldy> Crassus: that's usually not relevant
[19:40:25] <Crassus> moldy: It seems like you are talking about multiple scripts user may know, rather than whether than they know Hindu-Arabic numerals.
[19:40:30] <moldy> Crassus: when you really mean 0-9, you should write `[0-9]`, not `\d`
[19:40:40] <moldy> Crassus: i'm talking about searching, input validation, etc.
[19:40:41] <GinFuyou> mad_moses, yeah, I just forgot the syntax ^_^'
[19:40:57] <Crassus> moldy: I agree there.
[19:41:15] <Crassus> moldy: I think it's kind of academic though tbh
[19:41:28] <mad_moses> GinFuyou: But there is an other problem which I forgot. The string/substring should have a maximum 20 character in total. (At the end. I want to check if there is a possible phone number within a text)
[19:42:24] <moldy> that sounds incredibly fragile
