[18:22:15] <andreyorst> whichi is kinda unpythonish
[18:22:32] <Para> Google effect, maybe?
[18:23:09] <andreyorst> well, people are going around sublclassing unittest.TestCase and go into debates what case to use to extend it
[18:23:12] *** Joins: materialfuture (~materialf@149.248.8.187)
[18:23:57] <Para> I thought Python had settled on Pascal case for all class names?
[18:24:51] <andreyorst> IDK I've never wrote python, just know some people who have discussed this problem casually
[18:25:12] <Para> Bikeshedding, probably.
[18:25:22] <ridcully> if you can go greenfield, log your maps into ES by whatever means.  but once you have libs etc with logging caps... welcome to jul/jul2/logback/slf4/hell-and-back...
[18:25:50] <Para> I guess the cool kids would do everything with OpenTracing now.
[18:26:25] <Para> Or whatever is the stable. Just had a discussion about this yesterday, I guess OpenTelemetry is the one being used now because of the constantly moving + renamed target.
[18:27:14] <andreyorst> we've used timbre for some projects, but now I see the move to tools.logging
[18:27:28] <andreyorst> tbh I don't really see the difference
[18:27:47] <Para> timbre is not worth it IMHO
[18:28:14] <Para> It's been built on purpose to ignore all java loggings. The configuration tends to be more convoluted (in real world project I've encourtered, that is) than just a simple XML would be.
[18:28:47] <Para> you need to have this https://github.com/fzakaria/slf4j-timbre to be able to even capture anything that goes through SLF4J.
[18:28:57] <Para> Timbre somehow completely nullifies SLF4J in project.
[18:29:36] <ridcully> if you need the logging from your libs, you are pretty much stuck to some aggregator like tools.logging
[18:29:49] <Para> Well normally that'd be SLF4J :)
[18:30:41] <ridcully> at least things like logback/slf4j allow for logging maps and you can set them up to logstash->es
[18:30:58] <Para> Yep! The appender ecosystem is quite extensive and mature.
[18:31:14] <Para> And the map logging thingy works. And that pair has been highly optimized even.
[19:01:16] <sobel> is there any more to "observability" than structured logging/accounting/profiling baked into your code?
[19:01:27] <sobel> can i get a debunker on that one? :)
[19:03:16] <technomancy> one thing I learned from erlang is that logging is just a workaround for not having good distributed trace functionality in your language
[19:08:46] <sobel> zing
[19:09:08] <ridcully> if you log with some ingress-uuid you basically have distributed tracing
[19:09:34] <sobel> to the extent i've built accountability into code, i've been able to make it a useful self-diagnostic that's often more valuable than anything a profiler or other generic tool could be
[19:09:39] <Para> flow identifier + something else for sequence ordering and you're golden
[19:10:00] <Para> And I guess a label giving it a human readable context.
[19:10:11] <sobel> i do log a bunch of actions on unique id basis, so i can fish out specific events
[19:15:26] <technomancy> ridcully: yeah but *good* distributed tracing means you can tell it a pattern to match against *any* given function across your entire cluster and have the results sent directly to your repl with a trigger that once you've gotten (say) 500 it automatically shuts off to avoid flooding you
[19:15:44] <technomancy> leaving the repl to view your logs is for chumps
[19:15:53] <technomancy> (I'm a chump in this context since leaving erlang)
[19:16:35] <Para> There's that phrase again, pattern matching. Is everything matchable in the future? No wait, don't tell me!
[19:17:47] <ridcully> technomancy: but without the retrospective aspects of "logging" you don't have the introspection how things improved/degraded
[19:18:19] <ridcully> i have optimized things way to often against a graph in kibana to not love my "log maps to ES"
[19:18:36] <ridcully> yet i am just a dabbler on BEAM and i wish to learn more on that front
[19:18:53] <technomancy> ridcully: yeah, I'm exaggerating as it's not a complete replacement; just a 90% replacement
[19:19:28] <technomancy> it's less helpful for situation where you had a problem that only triggers a handful of times a week
