[00:09:51] <edman007> Hey, so I'm trying to call av_hwdevice_get_hwframe_constraints() with a HWconfig (VAAPI), the hwconfig needs a VAConfigID, all the examples show getting it from the avcodeccontext, however I'm trying to do this from a filter (via hwupload), I don't have a VAAPIcodeccontext, I have a HW device context, and a HW frames context. I don't see how I get a VAConfigID from either of those, my eventual goal is run it to a VAAPI encoder, but I don't have that
[00:09:51] <edman007> initilized because I want to select a pixel format, based on the HW, that is compatible with encoder so I can initilize the encoder against that pixel format
[00:21:37] <Manouchehri> Wow, RTMP really sucks

[01:19:02] <Manouchehri> question!
[01:19:31] <Manouchehri> ffmpeg -fflags nobuffer  -f flv -listen 1 -i rtmp://192.168.1.100:44444/live/app -c copy -strict -2 -tune zerolatency -f mpegts -mode listener -transtype live -tlpktdrop 1 "udp://127.0.0.1:1936" # does the "zerolatency" mode do anything here, or no, because I'm just doing a straight copy?
[01:20:35] <JEEB> tune is a libx264 (and possibly libx265) option (see `ffmpeg -h encoder=libx264`), so no
[01:21:05] <Manouchehri> thank you! You're awesome. I love IRC. :p
[01:22:04] *** Quits: minimal (~minimal@user/minimal) (Quit: Leaving)
[01:23:25] <Manouchehri> JEEB: so basically I'm trying to pipe a live feed into OBS Studio with ffmpeg. :) At the moment, with the ffmpeg command I have, there's quite a lot of latency, but I'm google'ing and trying to figure out how to drop frames and speed up the playback (if that makes sense?)
[01:27:47] <BtbN> Why don't you just open the stream in OBS?
[01:28:40] <Manouchehri> BtbN: that is a very good question, thank you for asking, I should have started with that! I don't/didn't think it was possible for OBS to act as a rtmp server like ffmpeg is doing here, right?
[01:28:44] <Manouchehri> I would *love* to be wrong.
[01:29:17] <BtbN> oh, you are _listening_
[01:29:24] <Manouchehri> ya :)
[01:29:26] <BtbN> Yeah, don't use that, that's not a well implemented thing
[01:29:29] <BtbN> run nginx-rtmp or something
[01:29:32] <Manouchehri> oh
[01:30:04] <Manouchehri> what makes you think it's bad? :p if I *only* save it to a file, it's pretty good tbh
[01:30:42] <BtbN> The build in rtmp server is poorly implemented and not in any way stable
[01:31:09] <Manouchehri> I looked at this, but I wasn't sure if it's just using ffmpeg under the hood. https://github.com/ossrs/srs
[01:31:10] <BtbN> It handles connection losses poorly, among other issues
[01:32:23] <BtbN> Never heard of that
[01:32:30] <BtbN> any proper rtmp server will work really
[01:32:42] <Manouchehri> nginx-rtmp seems so heavy for just something that basically needs to be remuxed.
[01:33:15] <BtbN> hm? Remuxing is pretty much all it can do
[01:33:31] <Manouchehri> sorry, does "it" mean nginx-rtmp or ffmpeg?
[01:33:40] <BtbN> yes
[01:33:43] <BtbN> nginx
[01:33:57] <BtbN> It's as barebones of an rtmp server as you can get
[01:37:06] *** Quits: SpeakerToMeat (~Speaker@user/speakertomeat) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[01:44:18] <Manouchehri> BtbN: so I know I'm doing bad things (tm), but humour this for a second :P
[01:44:23] <Manouchehri> ffmpeg -fflags nobuffer  -f flv -rtmp_buffer 0 -rtmp_live live -tcp_nodelay 1 -listen 1 -i rtmp://192.168.1.100:44444/live/app -c copy -strict -2 -tune zerolatency -f mpegts "udp://127.0.0.1:1936"
[01:44:34] <Manouchehri> why does my latency seem to get higher and higher as time goes on?
[01:44:43] <Manouchehri> my guess is because I need to drop frames or something instead of buffering
[01:44:49] <Manouchehri> but I'm not sure I see where the buffering is happening
[01:44:58] <BtbN> That's just the nature of live streams without any kind of "recovery mechanism"
[01:45:08] <BtbN> Every time it buffers a bit, it gets a bit more behind
[01:45:14] <Manouchehri> right right
[01:45:19] <Manouchehri> but I want it to just drop frames instead
[01:45:23] <Manouchehri> not buffer
[01:52:26] <Manouchehri> I think SRS is probably what I want

[02:07:06] <JEEB> for reading indeed mpegvideo most likely
[02:07:07] <emcodem> with loglevel debug i am not sure if i see it
[02:07:14] <JEEB> you don't even need that high
[02:07:25] <JEEB> literally the Input: section in ffmpeg.c or ffprobe
[02:07:42] <emcodem> Input #0, mpegvideo,
[02:07:52] <JEEB> yup
[02:08:05] <JEEB> so raw demuxer is called mpegvideo, and writer is called mpeg2video
[02:08:38] <emcodem> it's listed as demuxer but not as format ...

[11:26:20] <RandomStroke> Hey everyone ! Can any1 give me a tip on how to include ffmpeg sources in 3rd party project ? By now , if i include ffmpeg-master in my qt project , i get huge amount of errors because of the wrong paths in ffmpeg's headers and sources.
[11:26:55] <JEEB> when you build FFmpeg, during configure you can set --prefix
[11:27:26] <JEEB> then after you build, you make install and FFmpeg's public headers and libraries get installed into PREFIX/{include,lib} etc
[11:27:35] <JEEB> so, if you then f.ex. have pkgconf
[11:28:06] <JEEB> PKG_CONFIG_PATH=PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig pkgconf --libs libavcodec
[11:28:15] <JEEB> should give you a nice -L as well as the required -ls
[11:28:18] <RandomStroke> ah , thx ! So you mean that i have to build ffmpeg first and only then i'll be able to use it's sources ?
[11:28:31] <JEEB> yes

[11:30:31] <RandomStroke> thank you. I've tried to build it with given intructions , have msys2 and mingw installed but eventually got this error "Native MSYS builds are discouraged, please use the MINGW environment" , googled it but found nothing...maybe some1 encountered the same
[11:31:16] <JEEB> you are most likely in the wrong msys2 terminal
[11:31:21] *** Quits: anotheruser (~user@197.54.55.123) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[11:32:24] <JEEB> for windows MSVS project ffms2 just switched to some packaging thing, maybe vcpkg. it still builds FFmpeg on the spot due to various requirements like which CRT you're using etc, but might be simpler if you are utilizing MSVS
[11:33:24] <JEEB> https://github.com/FFMS/ffms2/commit/9525fcd3c6de48f9390584abd320e976e695549d
[11:33:36] <JEEB> so if you are primarily a windows project, that might be a simplifier?
[11:34:00] <JEEB> the FFmpeg project does not maintain the vcpkg stuff, but if Myrs saw it as useful...
[11:37:33] <RandomStroke> hm...i'm a bit lost at this point. I mean , it's told in the docs that all you need to build ffmpeg for windows are mingw and msys.
[11:39:41] <JEEB> yup
[11:39:49] <JEEB> msys2 provides the packages
[11:40:06] <JEEB> then mingw-w64 toolchain is what you want
[11:40:15] <RandomStroke> yep and i've got it installed for sure
[11:40:29] <RandomStroke> with a pacman)
[11:40:44] <JEEB> but if you're stuck then I mentioned vcpkg since it automates the building apparently
[11:40:47] <JEEB> :P
[11:40:54] <JEEB> not sure what sort of config it's utilizing
[11:41:09] <JEEB> but in theory if you hvae the msys2 mingw-w64 terminal open
[11:41:32] <JEEB> you should do a mkdir -p mingw_build && cd mingw_build && path/to/ffmpeg/configure
[11:41:46] <JEEB> (and I guess --prefix :) )
[11:42:58] <RandomStroke> does "msys2 mingw-w64" terminal mean mingw64 , right ?)

[15:29:01] <pk08> but those data are from struct EBUR128Context and i dont think its available in library
[15:29:10] <JEEB> check the AVFrames :P

[15:32:41] <pk08> command and output
[15:33:25] <JEEB> for some reason it's disabled by default, but the filter does have the ability to write metadata values into the AVFrame
[15:33:26] <pk08> so for me, i guess i need to change f_ebur128.c file and add option to log this into a file
[15:33:33] <JEEB> no
[15:33:38] <JEEB> you enable the metadata boolean option
[15:33:51] <JEEB> and you write an aPI client (or patch ffmpeg.c) to read those metadata entries
[15:34:28] <JEEB> and write them out in whatever way you prefer
[15:34:29] <furq> you can write the values to a file with ametadata=mode=print:file=foo.txt
[15:34:36] <furq> but not in any nicely formatted way
[15:35:03] <JEEB> yea what is needed is a tool like ffprobe but with filter chain capability
[15:35:18] <JEEB> random filters writing out is just Not Good
[15:35:24] <DeHackEd> I think [a]metadata filter is at least adequate
[15:35:33] <DeHackEd> some parsing after the fact required but it should be a lot more consistent
[15:36:11] <JEEB> but yea, ffmpeg.c already does filter chains so you could add functionality to dump metadata from received AVFrames here
[15:36:14] <JEEB> *there
[15:36:38] <furq> but yeah filters just dumping that data into stderr sucks
[15:36:58] <JEEB> also various data is clearly structured so side data would be much better in that sense
[15:37:06] <JEEB> but at least filters write metadata
[15:37:13] <JEEB> so people can do the Right Thing
[15:37:22] <JEEB> and do the formatted output in an API client
[15:39:41] <furq> well some do
[15:40:18] <furq> there's at least some filters where you're just stuck reading it from stderr
[15:40:25] <JEEB> sure
[15:40:36] <JEEB> but at least this guy's use case can be implemented half-way properly :P

[16:20:33] <roxlu> Hi!
[16:22:20] <roxlu> I'm looking at this app which uses the ffmpeg libs to do transcoding. I'm in particular trying to figure out why transcoding using this custom app/util is less performant than when using the ffmpeg util. I've got a guess that it's related to how threading is done in this app, but I want to verify this.  Does someone have some advice on how I could do this? I'm thinking `perf` might be helpfull
[16:22:22] <roxlu> here, but I'm not yet sure how to use that correctly.

[19:01:59] <luc4> Hello! Is there an overlay filter that can overlay multiple streams on another? My understanding is that the overlay filter only takes two parameters, so it can only work with 1 overlay.
[19:02:34] <furq> you can just chain overlays together

[20:50:27] <bartzy> what's the difference between the container duration and the stream duration? When there's only one video stream in the file
[20:50:44] <bartzy> what most players show to users as the duration? what is the other one used for then?
[20:52:38] <DeHackEd> in theory the video of a file can be longer or shorter than the audio, for example. so the container duration should be the longer of the two. or in extreme cases, longer than either one if there's an early start in one stream, and a late end on another... ?
