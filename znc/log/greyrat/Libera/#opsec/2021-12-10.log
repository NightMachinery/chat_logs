[02:13:25] <Joanna> jan6: thanks for the explanation. I still believe that the failure to solve the spoofing problem is deliberate. I’m no expert on networking but even I can come up with some low tech ideas such as calling them back to see if phone number is correct.
[02:13:57] <jan6> keep in mind I'm not an expert in anything, even if I sound like that
[02:30:59] <Joanna> In the swatting incidents the prank caller calls up and says he is going to kill his family. Who would call the police when they want to kill their family ? It doesn’t even make sense.

[02:35:32] *** Joins: pyfisch (~pyfisch@user/pyfisch)
[02:40:42] <Joanna> jan6: maybe. But nobody cares about how these people became deranged therefore the problem is there on purpose to destabilize society and make people dependent upon police which any crime victim can tell you are a big disappointment.
[02:40:53] <jan6> there's plenty of cases of killers actually calling police on themselves, for one reason or another
[02:40:59] <jan6> after kill, not before, of course
[02:41:42] <jan6> what " problem is there on purpose " ?
[02:50:21] <Joanna> A lot of criminals are mind control victims it’s not their choice to do what they do.
[02:53:39] <jan6> depends on how you define criminals, and mind control
[02:54:40] <jan6> I'd say "manipulated" rather than "mind control" in any case
[02:55:54] <jan6> imho "mind control" evokes the scifi imagery of "now, go and kill your brother" "but.." *bzzt* "I said go!"
[02:58:35] <Joanna> They get people as children and torture them for years to make them into mind controlled assets
[02:59:05] <Joanna> Actually all of us are mind controlled to some extent.
[03:00:12] <Joanna> The mind controlled person doesn’t think of it as killing his brother he thinks brother is a monster or something like that.
[03:00:48] <jan6> who "they" torture?
[03:01:15] <jan6> because torture is pretty specific, and not general abuse
[03:01:49] <jan6> although I guess it applies
[03:02:44] *** Joins: gce108 (~gce@user/gce108)
[03:03:35] <Joanna> There is a book by fritz springmeier called how to create an undetectable mind controlled slave that can explain it better.
[03:04:00] <Joanna> There are all sorts of traumas they do
[03:06:42] <Joanna> jan6:
[03:07:07] <jan6> sure
[03:07:16] <jan6> a lot is *possible*
[03:08:09] <jan6> but it depends by groups and people, how much they do, and how much will work
[03:08:13] <Joanna> Plus it’s really hard to knoe what is actually happening when the news media is the main source of information.
[03:08:52] <jan6> most of the time it's probably an intentional side-effect of brainwashing, not a goal in itself
[03:09:14] <Joanna> They have a whole methodology of how to do it. But some people don’t survive and die or become insane.
[03:09:32] <jan6> like "glorious leader gives us rations, if someone steals any, they must be punished, doesn't matter if they have 9 kids"
[03:10:46] <Joanna> We are all mind controlled but not as fully as the people who do things without remembering what they did.
[03:11:14] <jan6> I, for one, am not controlled, only influenced ;P
[03:12:40] <jan6> nobody controls what I do, there's only a bit of societal pressure to live life in a certain way (plus of course laws dictating what is right and what is wrong, but "it's not illegal if nobody finds out")
[03:15:37] <jan6> for example our household has never had a TV, I don't have a driving license, and prolly won't get a car for the next decade or few, I waste away my life online instead of fixing my life and getting an income, etc...

[03:23:33] <Hydragyrum> yeah but which software you run makes a big difference
[03:24:26] <Hydragyrum> if you're on windows consooming the mainstream sort of media and software products, that's totally different from being on linux using irc and whatnot
[03:24:55] <Joanna> It sure does. Lacking software or having buggy software can get you killed in a jiffy.

[04:01:36] <jan6> crowdsourced since there's no way to automatically detect if something is a sponsored segment or not

[04:13:14] <Joanna> Oops I was reading old message..
[04:13:52] * jan6 doesn't read boring books, generally
[04:14:28] <Joanna> I liked YouTube when it was just non commercial stuff
[04:14:45] <jan6> I liked youtube till like 2020, when they fudged up the algorithm
[04:14:53] <jan6> it's been broken ever since
[04:15:00] <Joanna> jan6: the book was interesting for me. It’s really more disturbing than boring
[04:15:13] <Joanna> Google bought it
[04:15:22] <jan6> then they did the moronic move of removing dislike count from everyone, by force, despite like literally everyone telling them it was a horrible idea
[04:15:56] <jan6> google buying youtube didn't change it
[04:16:27] <jan6> well, other than the godawful "gone with the black, forcing the white theme.....alright you suffered for years, have a dark theme again"
[04:16:51] <jan6> all it did was start giving creators money
[04:17:13] <Joanna> I liked YouTube before I had to sign in to save videos
[04:17:21] <jan6> everything else has been the natural evolution of people making it their job, instead of a fun side project
[04:17:31] <jan6> "save" videos?
[04:17:35] <jan6> playlists?
[04:17:53] <jan6> playlists have been called "playlists" on youtube since at least like, 2014 or so
[04:18:14] <Hydragyrum> invidious lets you save videos *properly*
[04:18:30] <jan6> if you bother to use dev tools, so does youtube ;P
[04:18:41] <Hydragyrum> well that's a pita tbh
[04:18:44] <jan6> you can use network monitor, to fish out the media urls ;P

[04:20:16] <jan6> it's not actually even that hard or annoying
[04:20:55] <jan6> only problem is that at >360p quality you're getting split streams, usually, so *THAT* would be a PITA to deal with
