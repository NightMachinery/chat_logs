[09:45:18] <soulisson> Hello. Sorry to bother you. I'm not sure to understand the word "technique". Is a technique "the execution of a series of actions in order to reach a goal" or "an ordered set of instructions/principles which execution allows to reach a goal" or maybe both depending on the context?
[09:47:56] <StayHungry> soulisson: https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/technique
[09:52:19] <pussipupu> It can certainly carry shades of both, alongside suggestions of finesse for instance
[09:53:21] <soulisson> pussipupu, ok, thanks a lot. 
[09:57:50] <soulisson> pussipupu, just to be sure. If someone performs a series of organized actions, this is a technique (definition 1). If two persons performs 2 identical series of actions, these are 2 executions of a single technique (definition 2).

[10:11:04] <pussipupu> What's the word for a file that's valid source for multiple computer languages?
[10:12:38] <ksft> polyglot?
[10:13:03] <ksft> same as the word for a person who speaks many languages
[10:14:42] <pussipupu> Hmm, I thought there was something else but maybe I'm just misremembering
[10:15:32] <pussipupu> Seems like “polyglot” should be an execution environment that supports multiple languages to fit the analogy :þ
[10:15:54] <pussipupu> Cheers
[10:17:17] <ksft> yeah, the analogy isn't perfect
[10:17:24] <pussipupu> Wikipedia suggests that the default for “polyglot” as in file is for something that does the same thing in multiple languages, but that the more general validity criterion is also used
