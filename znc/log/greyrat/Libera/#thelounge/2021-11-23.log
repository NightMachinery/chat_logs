[09:11:57] <termer> Has anyone considered the fact that videos and audio are embedded inline as a sort of privacy concern?
[09:12:08] <termer> with images, IPs can't be leaked because thelounge caches them
[09:12:28] <termer> but with video and audio, someone can easily see who's viewing them since it's not proxied or cached
[09:12:38] <termer> I'm thinking maybe not caching, but being able to proxy media would be a good idea

[14:33:24] <fnutt> Regarding #4371 - don't get me wrong, I do like it a lot! But.... it uploads the text as .txt file, if I read the code correctly.
[14:33:25] <thelounge-bot> 07¬ª 09Merged pull request 12#4371 - Remove downloads badge and add thelounge/thelounge-docker link to README https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/pull/4371
[14:33:46] <fnutt> With IRCCloud it shows the text in a much more pleassent way.
[14:34:29] <fnutt> Browser showing .txt file is just nasty.
[14:34:42] <fnutt> It looks simple and not pleassent at all.
[14:35:14] <fnutt> The pr is a step in the right direction, but not the optimal solution in my opinion.
[14:43:48] *** Joins: Viciouss (~viciouss@user/viciouss)
[14:44:14] <bookworm> you do realize that a lot of IRC users will disagree right? Considering that they are in a terminal. text/plain is perfectly fine. The feature should be used very, very sparingly anyhow. Else you have the exact same situation as with the matrix bridge
[14:46:06] <bookworm> chances are that if you need something fancier you should be using a specific thing anyhow, for go code that's the go playground, python has their preferred paste service as well that makes it easy to edit some code and immediately reshare it
[14:46:35] <easymac> "a lot of IRC users prefer bad UX" isn't very convincing 
[14:47:17] <bookworm> it's what the rest of the network will see though
[14:47:55] <bookworm> look at all the bots that immediately rewrite the fancy js riddled links with the raw one
[14:48:25] <easymac> sounds like the problem has already been solved 
[14:48:40] <bookworm> yes, by using text/plain ;)
[14:48:42] <easymac> is there any data showing what portion of irc users open links in terminal?
[14:49:42] <bookworm> depends on the community you are interacting with
[14:49:54] <easymac> seems like a pretty specific use case 
[14:50:12] <bookworm> it's still IRC though, we should strive to keep it at that and until ircv3 gets it, we don't have multiline
[14:50:18] <fnutt> Don't forget what The Lounge client are for, and what the goals are for the client.
[14:50:22] <easymac> ^
[14:50:32] <fnutt> Easy, simple to use, clean.
[14:50:41] <easymac> does the irc protocol support file uploads to a server?
[14:50:43] <bookworm> while still being IRC
[14:50:44] <fnutt> Plain .txt file is just rubbish to look at.
[14:50:53] <bookworm> fix your browser
[14:50:59] <easymac> fix your terminal 
[14:50:59] <easymac> :)
[14:51:08] <fnutt> bookworm: You don't like IRCCloud text uploading?
[14:51:17] <bookworm> no
[14:51:33] <easymac> how is this meaningfully different from uploading images 
[14:51:34] <fnutt> It looks far better than a plain .txt file viewed in browser.
[14:52:08] <easymac> ^
[14:52:09] <fnutt> Indeed. We should remove any fancy nice stuff for images as well.
[14:52:10] <bookworm> easymac: we serve images as image mime type, not in a fancy frame
[14:52:16] <easymac> but you serve images
[14:52:22] <fnutt> Better to have them plain and viewed by the browser.
[14:52:23] <bookworm> and?
[14:52:49] <fnutt> Why is it better to view the .txt file plain?
[14:52:53] <bookworm> I'm not saying we can't put in a pastebin as well, but it should serve text
[14:52:53] <easymac> how would formatting a text paste be further from "still being IRC" than uploading images 
[14:53:18] <easymac> so it should be the worst pastebin possible
[14:53:39] <bookworm> we just serve images, we don't show you a image gallery viewer. You get the raw image bytes
[14:53:41] <easymac> because someone might open the link in a terminal 
[14:53:47] <Activ8> How about an option somewhere for a pastebin link? that would be great
[14:53:50] <bookworm> same should be the case for text in my opinion
[14:54:06] <fnutt> Because of some old people using clients in their terminals?
[14:54:31] <bookworm> no to avoid the same shit the matrix people make us go through
[14:54:33] <fnutt> Is TL going to make those users happy, instead of making a beatiful client that is easy to use for most people?
[14:54:39] <bookworm> x sent a long message
[14:55:00] <Activ8> the lounge is a beautiful client
[14:55:06] <fnutt> Sure sure... then preview them in-line.
[14:55:17] <fnutt> Activ8: Yes, but .txt files are not!
[14:55:45] <Activ8> where is this txt file you speak of
[14:56:13] <fnutt> https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/pull/4371
[14:56:40] <fnutt> With this PR long text inputs are converted to .txt files and linked in chat.
[14:56:49] <bookworm> you are stil talking IRC, it should look good for *everyone* using an IRC client and nothing TL currently does would in any way collide with that. We host images as plain links, same as any pastebin. That's fine. We can serve text files the exact same way, it can simply serve the text file with the proper html content type
[14:56:58] <fnutt> When you view a .txt file in your browser you'll see it looks AUGLY as....
[14:57:24] <fnutt> Yes, but at least you see the images nicely in The Lounge client.
[14:57:32] <bookworm> it doesn't, looks like black text in your default seriv font on a white background
[14:57:45] <bookworm> and we already do the same for text
[14:57:49] <bookworm> within TL
[14:57:52] <fnutt> Yes, and with nothing else. In my opinion that looks augly.
[14:57:58] <easymac> "it should look good for *everyone* using an IRC client" -> your solution looks bad for everyone for the purpose of making it more readable for people who would *open the link in a terminal*
[14:58:35] <easymac> those people i'm sure are used to opening links to other pastebin services
[14:58:40] <bookworm> it doesn't look at all, you have no clue how people look at it. You have no idea about the browser, nor CSS, nor OS or anything elde
[14:59:18] <easymac> i wouldn't say you have "no clue" when you can make a very, very, very good guess
[14:59:23] <fnutt> bookworm: Exactly, so lets make them look nice for those using The Lounge client!
[14:59:41] <bookworm> the whole point of the content type is to say the client consuming it how to display things
[15:00:09] <easymac> that's a great ideal but the reality of sharing content on the internet is not in plain text for a reason
[15:00:11] <bookworm> we can render it for TL just fine without serving the file in some sort of rendered pastebin
[15:01:09] <fnutt> Anyhow, I am strongly! against looking at plain .txt files in any of the browsers I use.
[15:01:26] <fnutt> Find a solution, please.

[15:02:14] *** Joins: Vercas4 (~Vercas@gateway/tor-sasl/vercas)
[15:02:40] <easymac> i have to reiterate: you're suggesting making the worst possible paste utility to provide an exceptionally marginal improvement to people who open links in terminal
[15:03:51] <bookworm> I'm not. I'm saying specify the content type to whatever the thing *is*. If you are just typing text that's text/plain, js? text/javascript or what have you
[15:04:06] <fnutt> I strongly think those using e.g. mIRC also would find it better open some nice looking pastebin instead of a .txt file in their browser.
[15:04:16] <fnutt> Yes you are.....
[15:04:43] <fnutt> Your solution bookworm is only better for those that opens .txt files in their Terminal.
[15:04:51] <fnutt> If there are others, please list them.
[15:05:04] <bookworm> so you want to show images in a gallery as well as the plain browser thing is ugly? That'd break out preview of images, just so you know
[15:05:32] <bookworm> same is true for any sort of prefetcher, if you don't serve it properly it doesn't know what it is and *can't* render it
[15:05:36] <easymac> nope, because that wouldn't be better UX
[15:05:44] <easymac> but in this case, it is better UX than serving raw txt
[15:06:28] <bookworm> it is really not. We could *within* TL properly render code, syntax highlighted and everything by doing that
[15:06:48] <bookworm> but for that you must serve the content properly
[15:07:02] <easymac> i don't want my irc client embedding code pastes into the chat buffer 
[15:07:24] <easymac> but
[15:07:30] <bookworm> other's would ;P same reasoning
[15:07:43] <bookworm> it's simply a similar preview as for images
[15:07:52] <easymac> the conversion process from the raw text output of the link to the display-worthy syntax highlighted version 
[15:07:55] <bookworm> and you'd probably limit the length etc
[15:08:01] <easymac> would also be capable of converting from a paste with minimal formatting
[15:08:14] <bookworm> no, as that's TL specific
[15:08:29] <bookworm> you'd limit any other client and that should not be a goal
[15:08:38] <bookworm> we don't do it for images either
[15:08:42] <fnutt> I prefer https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/sLh78VIy/ anyday!
[15:08:45] <easymac> images are best viewed as images 
[15:08:50] <bookworm> so is text
[15:08:50] <easymac> text is not best viewed as plaintext
[15:08:52] <fnutt> It looks nice.
[15:09:05] <bookworm> again, we can set the content type
[15:09:16] <bookworm> I'm not sure what's hard to understand there
[15:09:22] <easymac> i feel exactly the same way
[15:09:27] <fnutt> Me too.
[15:10:02] <fnutt> I find it weird you don't understand why we don't like to view plain .txt files in our browsers.
[15:10:11] <bookworm> so, preview of fnutts thing: snippet
[15:10:16] <fnutt> Have you tried it? It's not a pleassent experience.
[15:10:29] <Activ8> chill out 
[15:10:32] <bookworm> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/raw/sLh78VIy
[15:10:45] <bookworm> preview for that^ better
[15:11:03] <fnutt> ...and when you open the link it looks absolutly horrible.
[15:11:14] <bookworm> it's text
[15:11:21] <easymac> so what
[15:11:21] <fnutt> and it looks bad.
[15:11:21] <bookworm> without the useless sidebar too
[15:12:05] <easymac> like you said, it should look good for *everyone* using an irc client
[15:12:25] <bookworm> and it does
[15:12:27] <fnutt> easymac: I don't think we will solve anything here. Obvisiouly it's difficult for some people to understand some things.
[15:12:41] <fnutt> Anyhow, it's up to MaxLeiter to decide, not bookworm.
[15:12:42] <bookworm> their client can fetch the file in whatever form they can handle
[15:13:05] <easymac> it doesn't look good for anyone ...

[15:13:31] <bookworm> it's quite literally not looking bad, looks like information in a book

[15:14:00] <fnutt> bookworm: I'm sure you think terminal text looks good as well?
[15:14:03] <easymac> books .. have formatting 
[15:14:05] <bookworm> ircclouds pastbin shell renders horribly on my phone
[15:14:52] <fnutt> bookworm: Don't make that a point. There are better ways to make pastebin.
[15:15:00] *** Joins: Vercas (~Vercas@gateway/tor-sasl/vercas)
[15:15:20] <bookworm> yes but it's a whole separate project, in fact there's quite a bunch out there with different goals
[15:15:35] <fnutt> I'm sure we can make something that looks good on both large and small screens fairly easy.
[15:16:18] <shadoozo> We can probably try to figure something out that both looks good in previews and when you open it directly
[15:16:57] <fnutt> shadoozo: That would result in everyone else not using TL will view them as plain text in their browser.
[15:17:09] <bookworm> no
[15:17:28] <bookworm> that means we defer to their client while enhancing the experience of TL users
[15:17:35] <fnutt> If you output a .txt url in the chat and make it pretty for TL users viewing the .txt file, then yes.
[15:17:35] <bookworm> that's exactly what we *should* do
[15:17:53] <easymac> again, we're talking about content served over HTTP. which is going to be viewed in a web browser 99.9999% of the time
[15:17:58] <fnutt> THeir client will in most cases open the url in a browser.
[15:18:03] <bookworm> the same thing we are already doing with link previews and images
[15:19:08] <fnutt> If MaxLeiter doesn't agree with us making something better looking - can we please make it optional to use other pastebin services instead of serving plain .txt urls?
[15:19:50] <bookworm> (they don't have to be text/plain, we can serve the proper content type...)
[15:20:08] <fnutt> It has been asked for before, multiple times. One person even made a PR to support this (although it was his/her own pastebin services that was supported).
[15:20:14] <bookworm> but yes that seems like a sensible thing too
[15:20:32] <bookworm> can easily make a plugin hook
[15:21:03] <fnutt> ...and let's not make it - it can be done in a plugin (which most likely will not happen any time soon at all... since a lot has to be done before that can even happen etc. etc. etc.)
[15:21:27] <bookworm> that's an easy thing in this case
[15:21:43] <bookworm> specify an uploader i terface and a registration hook
[15:21:48] <bookworm> interface*
[15:21:59] <shadoozo> we can have a fancy view when you visit it directly in your browser and use meta tags to add descriptions n stuff for previews.
[15:22:09] <bookworm> and I know at least 10 pastebins, doesn't make sense to keep all those in core
[15:22:44] <fnutt> What about shadoozo's solution?
[15:23:09] <shadoozo> can also add /raw to the url if you want to be able to wget the file directly through your terminal or something
[15:23:37] <bookworm> I find it inferior to serving the file properly
[15:24:05] <shadoozo> bit like https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/raw/sLh78VIy 
[15:24:05] <fnutt> Again - please let us think for a second what TL's purpose is!
[15:24:09] <easymac> most people don't. that's why every other chat platform and almost every other pastebin doesn't work that way
[15:24:09] <bookworm> we can add /fancy too
[15:24:14] <fnutt> Easy to use. Nice looking. Simplicity!
[15:24:22] <shadoozo> irccloud could improve by adding meta tags so it looks better 
[15:25:00] <shadoozo> https://usercontent.twoopy.nl/7c372744fd4a6c44/image.png Snippet | IRCCloud isn't very descriptive
[15:25:43] <shadoozo> We probably want to aim for better UX so /raw would make more sense than /fancy imo
[15:26:02] <shadoozo> Thelounge isn't meant for powerusers
[15:26:05] <fnutt> shadoozo: How do you make TL look like that?
[15:26:10] <fnutt> Exactly
[15:26:51] <shadoozo> Was working on conversation layout (and the possibility for avatars) 
[15:27:07] <fnutt> As in code changes? or css?
[15:27:09] <shadoozo> but there's not a nice spec yet to use so avatars are a bit of a pain 
[15:27:12] <shadoozo> code changes
[15:28:02] <petteri> oho, congrats for the new release üëç I

[19:45:58] <xnaas> briefly**
[19:46:39] <bookworm> termer: you mean while you first enter the search terms or when you look at the results?
[19:50:30] <xnaas> I, personally, mean when scrolling to the oldest results.
[19:50:48] <xnaas> Can't see the button to load more results, but it's there, apparently, just hidden!
[19:51:22] <termer> bookworm I can't see the load more results button since it's covered by the search box after executing the search
[19:51:33] <bookworm> yes, when?
[19:52:00] <termer> https://lounge.termer.net/uploads/f3d6c6276b0abd61/image.png 
[19:52:02] <bookworm> prior to actually searching (aka not an issue) pr after searching when looking at the results? (bad)
[19:52:20] <termer> I clicked search, typed "test", hit enter, scrolled to the top, and this is the result
[19:52:43] <Activ8> what themes that termer
[19:52:54] <termer> my own, but I can disable and get the same result
[19:53:22] <bookworm> I see what you mean

[19:53:37] <Activ8> I don't get it on mine when I go all the way back after a search result
[19:53:52] <termer> well that's very odd
[19:55:08] <termer> also, if you search "a" for example, something with a lot of results, and click load more, you get jumped down below the top, but if you scroll up, it didn't actually load more
