[00:00:09] <InPhase> user51: For example, I'm on the OpenSCAD team, and I had previously declared that OpenSCAD is a bad language for artistic models, and mostly suitable for mechanical design work.  Then we created a challenge for ourselves at the end of each year, to make visually appealing demos.  This was one of my submissions for the first year of these challenges, and then I changed my mind, when I realized how

[02:24:06] <pyzozord> gc is great for producing more software
[02:24:18] <Izem> what does that mean?
[02:24:19] <pyzozord> at least the kind of gc that's in python
[02:24:57] <pyzozord> it means it lets you don't worry about memory, so you can worry about producing more software
[02:25:49] <pyzozord> it takes decisions for you, but it cannot make as good decisions as a developer who understands what this code is intended to do
[02:26:13] <pyzozord> the only gc I accept and, I actually really like, is call stack
[02:26:43] <Izem> using a gc means you have to know how it works ...

[02:28:18] <pyzozord> you don't care about perofmant code, you care about producing more code faster
[02:28:28] <pyzozord> that's why you use a gc
[02:28:41] <Izem> weird explanation
[02:28:56] <guest734> pyzozord: I wish websites stopped tried to be applications and went back to being websites --> I agree
[02:29:06] <pyzozord> if you care about performance you need to have better control over memory, either by directly manipulating it, or manipulating gc to do what you want it to do

[10:33:11] <user51> for example, i have an ALU for the gameboy. i think you could do it quite neatly if you pass the op as an argument. but then i just wonder why not do it the dumb way, without a jump table.

[13:41:28] <alycidyne> Logging is often given as the prime example of a cross-cutting concern, but what I think is that "cross-cutting concerns" aren't even concerns at all - they're simply parts of the environment which have been inappropriately put in the application
[13:41:28] <eson123> is there any database where the data is stored in the form of a queue ? i am trying to do some messaging programs and Queue seems to be the best option for messages
[13:41:30] <arahael> alycidyne: Well, you're not really using the term "function" as they are in programming languages.
[13:42:34] <deniska> eson123: in-memory or persistent?
[13:42:57] <alycidyne> arahael: I'm talking more about architecture as opposed to programming
[13:43:30] <arahael> alycidyne: Right, but in terms of aspect oriented development it's still ambigious. :)
[13:43:44] <eson123> deniska: persistent 
[13:44:18] <arahael> alycidyne: In my opinion, logging is something that happens throughout an application.
[13:44:28] <arahael> alycidyne: Usually for diagnostic purposes.
[13:44:43] <deniska> eson123: well, once in a while I read about kafka, which seems something along the lines of a persistent queue, but I'm not *too* sure on what kafka actually is :)

[13:46:19] <deniska> eson123: I've used redis for queue-like stuff, but in in-memory mode, although it seems they have some support for persistency too
[13:46:52] <alycidyne> Basically, specifying that an application logs something should be "considered harmful"
[13:46:57] <deniska> and then there's some persistency mode in rabbitmq
[13:47:11] <arahael> alycidyne: How so?
[13:47:15] <eson123> deniska: huh didn't know redis also supports persistency 
[13:48:04] <deniska> eson123: if you already have an sql database around which supports `select .. for update skip locked`, that's also a queue, in a pinch, if you don't need super high throughput :)

[13:50:01] <alycidyne> arahael: and I'll say that, in my case, I'm trying to debase aspect-oriented programming by calling into question the notion of a cross-cutting concern :-)

[14:21:38] <jtgd> user51: If you used an HP RPN calculator you wrote Forth :) 
[14:21:42] <user51> it was a cpu emulator, which used an array of function pointers, so you get somewhat close to forth's small definitions
[14:21:53] <GeDaMo> Threaded code

[14:22:43] <pikapika> user51, there is no need
[14:22:48] <user51> GeDaMo: so since the functions were small, they kinda map nicely to forth

[14:28:45] <pyzozord> just polish people speaking backwards
[14:29:25] <user51> GeDaMo: i also think the historical perspective is very important
[14:29:49] <pyzozord> I think K&R calulator falls a bit short of that. It implements few functions and variables and that's it
[14:29:55] <user51> while i don't claim to be any better than horrible in asm, i could sort of see how it maps to it
[14:30:01] <pyzozord> but it could be easily extended with if conditions etc
[14:30:19] <pikapika> rpn just removes the responsibility of building the stack from the tree from the calculator and places the burden on the user

[14:31:59] <pikapika> Thats a different problem
[14:32:03] <pikapika> much easier problem
[14:32:04] <user51> that's also an angle i've been thinking about, forth as an output language
[14:32:08] <pikapika> just needs a stack of lists
[14:32:10] <pikapika> conceptually
[14:32:36] <pikapika> Variable scoping is handled by a stack of lists type concept

[14:49:58] <pikapika> pyzozord, I had started with jacks book
[14:50:27] <pyzozord> bjs: oh right I think we discussed that and the conculsion was "no, it's more of a 'context-free with extras'"
[14:50:56] <pyzozord> pikapika: Let's Build a Compiler?
[14:51:02] <bjs> pyzozord: the truth is the chomsky-hierarchy is kind of arbitrary and languages can happily lie in between things
[14:51:04] <pikapika> Yes
[14:51:36] <pikapika> bjs, its a mathematically defined thing. So if something is more general than a cfg but not as much a turing machine, then yes it is a context sensitive lang
[14:51:50] <pikapika> the practical significance of the distinction is a different matter
[14:52:12] <pyzozord> well I'll read that PEG paper cold turkey now. See if I can make sense of it
[14:52:13] <bjs> pikapika: well context-sensitive means something specific, I'm not sure if PEGs really are equivalent to a context-sensitive grammar or whether there are context-sensitive languages you cannot represent with a PEG
[14:52:30] <pikapika> bjs, context sensitive subsumes all cfgs
[14:52:33] <bjs> I don't really know context-sensitive languages all that deeply, and I'm not sure anyone has done research
[14:52:35] <user51> reading the paper is surprisingly hard
[14:52:43] <bjs> pikapika: yes I'm not sure what your point is
[14:52:47] <pikapika> even if there is one production that is like AB -> xyz
[14:52:51] <pikapika> it is context sensitive
[14:53:08] <bjs> pikapika: PEGs do not have productions like that,  they have a different set of operators
[14:53:24] <pikapika> I meant if we are looking at it from pov of equivalent grmmars
[14:53:27] <bjs> It's not clear that PEGs exactly match what we call "context-sensitive" languages or whether they lie somewhere else
[14:53:50] <pikapika> if a peg can handle all cfgs plus some more, then it is at least a context sensitive lang

[14:56:31] <bjs> pikapika: I mean it's not true, you've got the argument backwards.  It's always "at least" what's above it.  Regexs are "at least" context-free.  You cannot say that a context-free language is also a regular one
[14:56:44] <pikapika> bjs, of course
[14:57:00] <pikapika> What I stated was that if your thing can handle all cfgs as well as some things that are not cfg
[14:57:06] <pikapika> then it is at least one step above
[14:57:52] <pikapika> but the problem here is that, while you claim this peg can handle some grammars that are context sensitive it is not known if it can handle all context sensitive grammars
[14:58:01] <bjs> pikapika: yes but I think you're taking the hierarchy a bit too seriously,  one step above does not mean you automatically gain *all* of context-sensitivity, not necessarily.

[15:05:47] <bjs> the truth is there's not that much interesting in understanding the space between context-free and Turing complete, as most languages are built using fairly context-free grammars with extra stuff ontop as pyzozord mentioned
[15:06:17] <bjs> rather than trying to squash the type system and scoping rules and name lookups into the grammar itself during parsing, you keep parsing context-free (or very close to context-free) then do some very simple passes over the top
[15:07:17] <pikapika> yeah turing in this case meant the power of the lang not the grammar
[15:07:19] <pikapika> if it was confusing
[15:07:28] <pikapika> its funny isn't it
[15:07:35] <bjs> pikapika: what's funny?
[15:07:51] <pikapika> that the power of a language and the language itself can be different categories

[15:12:11] <bjs> If you take something like Arm assembly, you have a finite number of registers (~32 of them) of finite size (64 bits), a finite amount of memory (2^64 bytes if we're overly generous), all the finite-ness is pretty baked in to an assembly language and kind of kills the "Turing complete"ness of it.  although I'm happy to be loose here and say that 2^64 is big enough to be 'practically infinite' ;)

[15:13:45] <bjs> pikapika: assembly is where the two blur though. high-level languages can get away with the languaeg definition allowing unbounded memory
[15:14:07] <bjs> but an assembly language really cannot, and so it's even harder to fight off the pedants for asm languages for Turing completeness
[15:14:29] <pikapika> The pedants are equalyl wrong in both cases

[15:15:28] <pikapika> Both are equally finite on real hardware, and when talking about "mathematical hardware" both are infinite
[15:15:52] <GeDaMo> user51: it's good, isn't it? :P
[15:15:54] <pikapika> The definition does not matter because if we theoretically wanted 128-bit ram the assembler would have 128 bit ints
[15:16:08] <bjs> pikapika: ... but you would need a different assembly language for it
[15:16:11] <pikapika> and so on
[15:16:20] <bjs> take Arm assembly for example,  the size of things is baked-in very very hard
[15:16:49] <bjs> Arm assembly (A64 to be specific let's say) is not Turing complete because everything is finite and fixed-size regardless of the underlying hardware
[15:16:52] <pikapika> Yes but as I said, the pedants argument is just as wrong if he were referring to java as he is to arm asm
[15:16:57] <pikapika> So its a moot point
[15:17:05] <bjs> pikapika: no, if they were talking about Java they would be wrong by some definitions
[15:17:13] <bjs> but not when talking about assembly (or in some respects, C)
[15:17:35] <pikapika> In java in fact the language specification mandates the sizes of the ints
[15:17:55] <bjs> yes but iirc it doesn't mandate the total size of a reference or how many objects you can have
[15:18:29] <bjs> A64 (Arm assembly) *does*, it puts real, honest, fixed-size constraints on all the things in the *language spec* not just in the implementation.  You could have a magical machine with infinite memory but if you wrote an A64 program you cannot use it all.
[15:18:36] <pikapika> It limits how many of an array you can reference. It does not matter having infinite objects if you can\t handle them at runtime like you would array refs.
[15:18:39] <pikapika> but then
[15:18:48] <pikapika> likewise you could make an argument that in any language you can make a hashmap
[15:18:59] <pikapika> you have theoretical turing completeness
[15:19:07] <pikapika> all of that boils down to is that the pedants are wrong
[15:19:13] <pikapika> They are confusing mathematics and physics

[15:20:42] <pikapika> I know what you are trying to say
[15:20:59] <bjs> Both the theoretical language, *and* any implementation, both have fixed limits on everything and therefore is not Turing complete

[15:22:27] <pikapika> And as I said, that is a moot point

[15:22:41] <Donitz> I remember Vector being a thing like a decade ago

[15:23:07] <pikapika> The moment it is brought into existence it all becomes a moot point
[15:23:30] <Donitz> it's quite easy to make something turing complete
[15:23:33] <bjs> pikapika: it's not really a moot point,  because languages have specifications.  A language can choose to not give a maximum size to anything (e.g. Python).  And we can happily talk about the language in terms of Turing completeness and it all works out fine

[15:24:03] <pikapika> bjs, it is fine only as long as we are talking about a pure mathematical entity that exists on paper
[15:24:07] <bjs> pikapika: yes but the point here is you're saying "Take language that is theoretically TC, and then the implementation is restricted so we may as well just forget the fact it got restricted"
[15:24:27] <pikapika> It does not matter at all, because all languages are living on an asm
[15:24:30] <bjs> but the point is that for something like A64 it's different because that finiteness restriction exists at every level, it's not an artefact of the real world it's baked into the language
[15:24:52] <bjs> (obviously it's baked into the language *because* it's a real-world language)

[15:46:17] <arahael> found something curious about my bank transactions from an american company - there's multiple charges. is that normal for american companies? (i mean, separate transactions for taxes, etc)
[15:46:22] *** Joins: Twipply (~Twipply@user/twipply)
[15:46:48] <bjs> pyzozord: because it's not the same language, and *because* it's risc it's extra cumbersome to write by hand so you need more support
[15:47:01] <bjs> whereas x86 has the higher-level baked right into the instructions (e.g. it has a push instruction...)
[15:47:40] <pyzozord> i see so th elanguage is higher level because the actual instructions are lower level
[15:47:49] <pyzozord> can you drop down to the lower level instructions if you want to?

[15:48:16] <bjs> pyzozord: this is just RISC vs CISC
[15:48:25] <bjs> RISC means you need lots of instructions to do simple things
[15:49:06] <pyzozord> I know I know. But the arm assemlby is higher level, so it compiles to more opcodes. I'm curious does it let you use those simple instructions directly, or does it force you to use it's higher level constructs

[15:55:46] <bjs> pyzozord: for e.g. Arm has a couple different MOVs: MOV X0,#42  to load 42 into a register.  MOV X0,X1  to copy X1 into X0.  MOV X0,SP  to read the stack pointer.
[15:56:54] <bjs> pyzozord: the assembler will "compile" these to MOVZ X0,#42 and ORR X0,XZR,X1  and ADD X0,SP,#0  -- you write "MOV" but there isn't actually a MOV opcode

[15:57:53] <bjs> and something like `MOV X0,[X1]` is just invalid syntax in Arm because MOV cannot move from memory.
[15:57:56] <pyzozord> huh, one would think that move is one of those elementary instruction that would be kept in a reduced set
[15:58:13] <bjs> pyzozord: well you have MOVZ which literally loads a value into a register

[15:59:52] <bjs> pyzozord: Arm has vector instructions -- it's perhaps not as RISCy as it could be :P
[16:00:05] <pyzozord> I guess my idea of what they would "reduce" from an instruction set

[16:12:46] <pyzozord> or is this not award for a paper, it's more a "funding"?

[17:50:09] <pyzozord> Oh, yeah I suspected that is some kind of common notation
[17:50:20] <pikapika> mrig, it specifically comes when there is a choice to go to the next state without consuming any input

[18:21:15] <pyzozord> "imple languages can be expressed easily in either paradigm. For example, {s ∈ a ∗ | s = (aa) n } is a generative definition of a trivial language over a unary character set, whose strings are “constructed” by concatenating pairs of a’s. In contrast, {s ∈ a ∗ | (|s| mod 2 = 0)} is a recognition-based definition of the same language, in which a string of a’s is “accepted” if its 
[18:21:21] <pyzozord> length is even."
