[05:22:24] <ns12> hodapp: I am not an expert in finance, but I think that for financial time series, there should also be a gap between the test set and the training set if you are using technical indicators that have a "lookback period" (e.g. 30 day moving averages).
[05:27:22] <ns12> Suppose you are using 30-day moving averages, and you have 100 days of data. You cannot split your data like this: days 0-70 for training, days 71-100 for testing. The reason is that the calculation of the 30-day moving average on day 71 will use the data from the training set. The data from the training set will "leak" into the test set. This is
[05:27:22] <ns12> invalid.

[19:41:12] <spaceseller> what is the good ML laptop?
[19:41:39] <HuntsMan> latest XPS 15/17
[19:42:17] <mefistofeles> spaceseller: and get an eGPU
[19:42:45] <mefistofeles> well, if you are actually planning on using things that would take advantage of a beefy GPU, tha tis
[19:44:58] <HuntsMan> The XPS 17 9710 has a RTX 3060 6 GB
[19:49:14] <mefistofeles> yeah, that's a good option, but you can get better with an eGPU, specially if you are planning on running it for hours at a time
[19:49:27] <mefistofeles> but yes, it's not cheap
[19:50:03] <mefistofeles> also it depends how much of your work will be on the move
[19:50:39] <mefistofeles> in my case, I went for a comfortable but powerful enough laptop and an eGPU
[19:50:41] <spaceseller> I hope that you will get me some XPS alternative.
[19:50:56] <mefistofeles> spaceseller: thinkpad xtreme ?
[19:52:05] <spaceseller> time, well colab google is great for my researches but limited with the time.
[19:53:22] <spaceseller> arch linux frendly
[19:56:50] <spaceseller> thinkpad, nice machine and thnx to the others for eGPU idea. That combination is pretty good alternative to the building powerful desktop machine.
[19:57:24] *** Joins: sinaowolabi_ (~SinaOwola@160.152.107.242)
[19:58:27] <spaceseller> as I saw eGPU is not too expansive.
[20:00:10] <spaceseller> expensive
[20:00:32] <mefistofeles> yeah, you can cut costs on the laptop if you are actually planning on getting an eGPU
[20:00:54] <mefistofeles> spaceseller: that said, expect a lot of manual configuration and fiddling with Linux
[20:01:20] <mefistofeles> I only use it as a coprocessor, I don't use it as a display device (that's too cumbersome and I won't be gaming or doing graphical design with it)
[20:04:19] <HuntsMan> nah no eGPU, in that case get a server with a GPU, no point of using a laptop in that case
[20:04:37] <dostoyevsky2> The Tongfang-GM7ZG8P has 16G... `GPU 0: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Laptop GPU'
[20:05:01] <mefistofeles> well, server with GPU is expensive, but in the long-term can be good, it all depends
[20:05:27] <HuntsMan> probably less expensive than the eGPU
[20:05:29] <mefistofeles> dostoyevsky2: nice, but still, I'd go with an eGPU :P unless you really need to go mobile (move around)
[20:05:31] <HuntsMan> have you seen GPU prices recently?
[20:05:38] <mefistofeles> HuntsMan: the eGPU case is about 300 USD
[20:05:48] <mefistofeles> and the GPU is whatever the GPU is, so that would be the same
[20:06:38] <dostoyevsky2> mefistofeles: Yeah, the tongfang is expensive like USD 2500... but I still love being able to run quite a lot of notebooks on it... I bought the Lenovo laptop earlier this year and it had only 6G ... which wasn't enough most of the time
[20:06:45] <mefistofeles> but you can get better GPUs (also upgreadable) and less temperature and wearing out of components in your laptop
[20:06:49] <mefistofeles> it all depends, tbh
[20:07:17] <mefistofeles> I hvae a thinkpad workstation with an eGPU (for work), that setups is almost ideal for my work
[20:07:54] <dostoyevsky2> mefistofeles: Yeah, for most of the year you couldn't buy any recent rtx cards though.... ;-)
[20:08:04] <dostoyevsky2> only from scalpers
[20:08:26] <mefistofeles> yeah
[20:08:36] <mefistofeles> I'll be getting an A4000 soon-ish
[20:08:38] <mefistofeles> hopefully
[20:27:00] <xs> you might find it cheaper to just rent a gpu or equivalent from a cloud provider. they are still advancing and getting better each year.
[20:28:02] <xs> of course, if where you live is a bit short on heating, then a cloud provider cannot compete.
[20:30:38] <mefistofeles> yeah, prices are getting better indeed
[20:31:08] <mefistofeles> it depends on the stage of your project, if your are planning on doing a lot of testing and trial and error, it can get very expensive with a cloud provider
[20:31:19] <mefistofeles> if it's production ready, or close to it, then it gets better, for sure
[20:31:55] <mefistofeles> consider cloud providers charge for traffic and storage independently, it's not just paying for the GPU

[23:24:51] <hodapp> ns12: look up roll-forward cross validation. The gist is that the future time-series has already incorporated information from the past, and so if you do the opposite (test on older time-series than you trained on) you are in effect contaminating your training data with that same information you test on
