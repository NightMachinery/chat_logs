[07:43:30] <Robomot> Cop Rock - Wikipedia (Cop Rock is an American police procedural musical television series created by Steven Bochco and William M.

[07:45:21] <gwern> 'This song was originally written for the 1990 musical TV show Cop Rock, but Newman recycled it for his 1995 version of Faust. In the TV show, it was sung by a cocaine-addicted mother (Kathleen Willhoite) to her baby, which she’s about to sell for enough money to buy her next fix. In the musical, it’s sung by a deranged Margaret to a stick, a substitute for a baby who has died.'

[07:51:20] <gwern> ...to work, do you just stick this blunt end into the cake or what? it was very confusing. so she sent it to her daughter for clarification, who very hastily clarified that under no circumstances were these to be purchased.)

[08:02:37] <feepbot> <gwern> https://twitter.com/juliahberg/status/1475170115561922560 the last college I read about boasting a similar fraction was stealing girls from other colleges at total subsidies of like $200k each. wonder how much it costs columbia
[08:02:38] <Robomot> Julia Hirschberg (@juliahberg): "Really happy to report that Columbia Computer Science majors as of the end of Fall 2021 are 48.33% women -- a result of our wonderful teaching faculty and students of instruction!"
[08:06:05] <gwern> another good relative story: in college, happened to go to a Baptist church along with her (male) roommate. they walk in before the service and are immediately asked how long they have been married etc and ushered into marriage counseling (which runs before each service, apparently), where people share their woes, and one woman recounts how her daughter will die, but it will be ok because...
[08:06:11] <gwern> ...she'll go to heaven. very heavy stuff. the service finally starts, and partway through, suddenly two kids in trenchcoats with AK-47s come striding down blasting away blanks at the choir, who collapse while throwing around red confetti/streamer. they walk up to the victims, where one girl is unshot. he points the ak-47 at her and asks if she believes in God. "Yes", she says, and he shoots...
[08:06:17] <gwern> ...her. it is announced she has gone to heaven as a martyr. my relative was *not* ready for a columbine reenactment. later, she talks to her grandma and says she went to a Baptist chuch and it was insane. "Honey", she replies, "you *never* go to a Baptist church."
[08:06:35] <PapuaHardyNet> "stealing girls" lmao
[08:07:08] <gwern> I mean, that's what happens. it can be quite literally recruiting from other colleges
[08:07:40] <PapuaHardyNet> so the greater the number of women you have in your college, the more funding you get from the government - is that the incentive?
[08:07:46] <gwern> I don't recall if harvey-mudd was doing that specifically, but they had *so* much money to get their girl numbers up, and a relatively tiny absolute number to hit, that maybe they didn't need to
[08:07:48] <PapuaHardyNet> surely it isn't simply signalling
[08:08:12] <gwern> there's probably government funding you can tap into. but no, I think most of it is just political/signaling
[08:09:01] <gwern> (tldr she and her roommate got off the boat. you never get off the boat.)
[08:11:22] <gwern> (the girl shot at the end was the daughter of the woman at the marriage counseling, if you couldn't guess. talk about dramatic foreshadowing.)

[10:54:06] <PapuaHardyNet> that's great
[10:54:15] <PapuaHardyNet> is that everyone in your family kuudes
[10:55:02] <adiabatic> so once her immune system adjusts to it do you get to change anything
[10:55:29] <adiabatic> or do you change nothing and just sleep better at night not having to worry that she'll bring the coof home and kill everyone with a two-digit age
[11:00:03] <feep> the coof, the coof
[11:01:21] <kuudes> after kids get their second dose, that brings them to three. I suppose at that point we know if omicron destroyed the society or how much
[11:01:37] <kuudes> and it indeed helps much toward more normal
[11:02:02] <kuudes> hopefully kids can return to school and daycare then
[11:02:25] <kuudes> adiabatic, mainly I feel better for that omicron is much less likely to kill or maim her
[11:03:56] <kuudes> I hope that with omicron we would finally get soon to lower prevalences again
[11:05:32] <kuudes> so likely little bit of both
[11:06:43] <kuudes> if this was delta, threedosing would ease things much faster, with omicron there are still so many unknowns, that I am waiting other people to get into hospital and icu first before presuming knowing

[11:33:28] <Shelby> I hear a lot of people say that because traditions are old they have a higher probability of carrying some truth or something useful to the population's that engage in them, which is why they've stayed around but wouldn't any tradition that doesn't explicitly end in the destruction of whatever civilization adopts it stay around and regardless of
[11:33:28] <Shelby> the negative it is doing and be bundled with all other beliefs and traditions that may or may not be providing something positive to those groups. And things like astrology, its estimated 2400 years old, is that enough time to dissect itself from a group of people if its not doing extreme damage to them?
[11:33:29] <Shelby> any one help me or point to a reference that can answer what im asking :S
[11:34:53] <ardent[m]> catgirls > geese anyway
[11:36:09] <feep> Shelby: that seems correct
[11:36:33] <feep> however, not quite - selection acts against traditions that directly kill its carrier
[11:36:36] <ardent[m]> re:astrology, there is an article I read once, may have been on SSC, that mentioned that divining had an actual purpose as a randomness generator for commons that get locally depleted
[11:36:55] <feep> though I remember reading comments that it was a stretch
[11:36:58] <Shelby> its carrier but if the carrier is a whole civilization, it'd seem unlikely that something like astrology would be that strong to 'kill' it yeah?
[11:37:18] <feep> yes, civilizational-scale traditions are to some extent protected from selection
[11:37:30] <feep> however, to get that big they usually start out as local traditions
[11:37:50] <feep> Shelby: to be clear though, this theory does *not* predict anything to the extent of "astrology is true"
[11:38:02] <feep> more like "when humans do astrology, *somehow* something good happens"
[11:38:15] <feep> that can be as simple as astrology acting like therapy
[11:38:22] <Shelby> im definitely not advocating that if anything I'm thinking more on the lines that it was something that could still be a negative, false and stick around.
[11:38:30] <feep> sure, can happen
[11:38:47] <feep> the argument here is more that there's better than chance odds that traditions do something
[11:39:08] <feep> probably higher the more scarce things were in the tradition's history; I'd expect the most negative traditions to go first
[11:39:22] <Shelby> I could even see it the other way around, i think a Slate star post he refrenced a book that linked the possibility of reading organs of animals to predict their migration patterns being basically random and that randomness led to people not over hunting those regions which was more benefical long term although it was actually technically a
[11:39:22] <Shelby> negative for them
[11:39:54] <feep> yeah that's the sort of thing I think where a biologist would yell "Group selection!!" and then bodyslam you through a wall
[11:39:57] <Obormot\Gaia> Shelby: Many things, including astrology, were originally used for some rational purpose but then that purpose was lost / made irrelevant, and in modernity they were repurposed to scam/con/trick people out of their money/status
[11:40:21] <Shelby> btw guys im totally not like trying to figure out if i should live my life through astrology or anything
[11:40:30] <feep> definitely live your life through astrology
[11:40:33] <ardent[m]> in modern times choosing a college major serves a similar purpose to one particular thing I'd think it could be useful for
[11:40:33] <feep> this can only end well

[11:40:35] <Robomot> Connor (@blamblamtheman): "No, but the older something is the more likely it is doing something important, even if the practitioners don't understand what. / https://scholars-stage.org/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are/" (https://nitter.snopyta.org/pic/card_img%2F1475046711974187010%2FK2PA15as%3Fformat%3Dpng%26name%3D800x320_1)
[11:41:13] <ardent[m]> that is, that it's useful to stay on one main path for a while, and perhaps believing you were destined for birth for a general area would help you choose instead of going back and forth
[11:41:31] <feep> choosing a college starsign
[11:41:36] <Obormot\Gaia> Shelby: e.g. astrology is an excellent device for a royal advisor to advise his sovereign without needing to assume a posture of higher status than said sovereign (on account of knowing better / being wiser) - just say "the stars indicate that <whatever>", and you'll be praised as a skilled reader of the portents if you're right, which works out ideally for you and your master
[11:41:45] <feep> Obormot\Gaia: same for oracles, I think
[11:41:45] <Shelby> no i more just have always had a little flinch away when i hear evolutionary psych/biologists talk about tradition in the context of religion or other things as not very strong evidence of their usefulness (atleast not totally, maybe in small pockets with regards to things like food restrictions)
[11:41:51] <Obormot\Gaia> feep: Quite so

[11:42:37] <Obormot\Gaia> Hm
[11:42:54] <ardent[m]> choice paralysis too... having a default that's not "do nothing" is very useful
[11:43:01] <feep> ("tradition" and "metis" are basically the same thing)
[11:43:16] <Shelby> I phrased that badly. I basically hear psychologist or evolutionary biologists think that what has helped us survive is 'good' or right, in an evolutionary context and then they try to use that as a rationale for why religion = good. But i feel like they aren't old enough to indicate this and also i can just see the possibility that large adoption
[11:43:16] <ardent[m]> since sometimes your system 2 gets tangled up (e.g. if there's more than about 10 things to choose from)
[11:43:17] <Shelby> of ideas would weed themselves out of groups even if they are bad
[11:43:31] <feep> Shelby: anyone who puts a moral point on this is a loon
[11:43:33] <feep> religion = useful
[11:43:41] <Shelby> wouldnt weed themselves out*
[11:43:45] <PapuaHardyNet> love that book
[11:44:26] <feep> that said, religion is ..... I don't think it's coincidence that p much all the world religions are like, really anodyne and adjusted to our modern world
[11:44:52] <feep> like how catholicism is like, "blood sacrifice? fuck that, tithe 10% of your income on your taxes and in exchange you get to go to cool atmospheric group meetings"
[11:45:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Are they really anodyne?
[11:45:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Islam isn't very anodyne at all
[11:45:28] <Shelby> yeah i find that not true tbh
[11:45:35] <PapuaHardyNet> knew you were gonna say that
[11:45:39] <feep> true re islam, but I think there's still a lot of local adaptation there
[11:45:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Even Catholicism is fucking nuts
[11:45:43] <Shelby> i think more just they where here as modern world developed so we've catered to them a bit
[11:45:52] <feep> I think the non-anodyne versions are also beneficial by local conditions
[11:45:54] <Shelby> dont think they're super compatible with some aspects of modern life tbh
[11:46:16] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: catholicism doesn't do anything to a first approximation
[11:46:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> On DSL we were just recently discussing how in places where Catholics have more power than in, say, the U.S., they go right ahead and ban abortion *even in cases where birth will kill the mother*
[11:46:48] <Shelby> sorry if i accidentally started a, is religion bad convo - wasn't my intention
[11:46:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> And the Catholic anti-birth-control campaigns in Africa that do so much to stifle anti-HIV efforts, etc.
[11:46:59] <feep> yeah that gets into that corner case between memes where like ... the religion bolsters the ingroup, and also *defines* the ingroup
[11:47:12] <feep> okay, granted re africa.
[11:47:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> So no, I don't buy the "anodyne" "Catholicism doesn't do anything" take at all, even a little
[11:47:29] <feep> though I think you could argue that what's happening with catholicism in africa is just the selection process at work.
[11:47:40] <PapuaHardyNet> why do so many Catholics go to Africa anyway?
[11:47:46] <Shelby> semi unrelated but, im somewhat surprised trump was recently being an advocate for the vaccines, you could hear the uncheeriness of his crowd it was interesting :P
[11:47:50] <feep> it's killing lots of people, and will promptly lose faith share in the medium run
[11:48:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes well while we wait for that *alleged* selection process to allegedly work, religions are doing a whole heck of a lot
[11:48:13] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: oyeah that's fair.
[11:48:23] <Shelby> PapuaHardyNet i think you get points for converting others and africa has so many issues that theres a lot of potential souls to save? I thought that was the narrative anyway

[11:48:43] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, it is a papacy video game

[11:48:53] <Shelby> lol sorry
[11:49:07] <feep> I think that was protestantism anyway
[11:49:10] <Shelby> it is points though, just they dont call it that. It's more like higher probability of eterenal salvation
[11:49:19] <feep> I don't actually know if *any
[11:49:26] <feep> * christian religion has salvation through works
[11:49:59] <Shelby> i thought it was all based on that, like belief is what gets you there but the real proof of your devotion to these ideals is that you act in a way that would make sense based on these beliefs
[11:50:09] <feep> it seems like a slamdunk of an adaptation, but it seems to have been repeatedly selected against
[11:50:25] <Shelby> if i believed in hell i think id be one of those guys on the corner yelling at people to join my cult so they didnt burn in hell forever
[11:50:31] <feep> Shelby: right but that's the kind of heresy where the pope goes "you're accusing god of needing proof?!"
[11:51:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> As usual, Judaism has the right idea here
[11:51:15] <feep> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation_in_Christianity
[11:51:16] <Robomot> Salvation in Christianity - Wikipedia (In Christianity, salvation (also called deliverance or redemption) is the "saving [of] human beings from sin and its consequences, which include death and separation from God" by Christ's death and resurrection,[1][a] and the justification following this salvation.)
[11:51:19] <Shelby> my fav question for religious people is "If god was real.. and like its all real, except there was no heaven, just hell. but he still prefered you act in the way he had apparently set out, would you still do it? Like no matter how good you are you're going to hell but he'd just prefer you act like a christian"
[11:51:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> i.e., not having a concept of salvation at all, because it's dumb.
[11:52:09] <feep> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_depravity also can I just say that christianity has the best terms
[11:52:09] <Robomot> Total depravity - Wikipedia (Total depravity (also called radical corruption[1] or pervasive depravity) is a Protestant theological doctrine derived from the concept of original sin. It teaches that, as a consequence of man's fall, every person born into the world is enslaved to the service of sin as a result of their fallen nature and, apart from the efficacious (irresistible) or prevenient (enabling) grace of …)
[11:52:14] <Shelby> i actually sometimes get people who say the truth and they go, well no if i wasn't going to heaven and i was going to get sent to hell i wouldnt be christian, which is uniquely interesting imo
[11:53:15] <Shelby> religion makes me sad tbh
[11:53:47] <Shelby> or more the way it placate's people to believe that this is all some loading screen for the real video game and you just gotta toughen it out until then. I dont like that.
[11:53:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Read about Judaism

[11:55:01] <Shelby> I doubt ill find my way reading up too much about judaism tbh. I read the quran, the bible and heaps of hindu and buddhist stuff but i dont see any time in the near future where it will eclipse other interest of mine
[11:55:51] <PapuaHardyNet> Shelby
[11:55:56] <Shelby> Can i just say some random thing here and if you guys want to tell me its misguided or help update my beliefs id be keen :)
[11:55:57] <PapuaHardyNet> Do you meditate?
[11:55:57] <Shelby> yes?
[11:56:00] <Shelby> si
[11:56:03] <Shelby> which is spanish for yes
[11:56:17] <PapuaHardyNet> how does it help you?
[11:56:51] <ardent[m]> Shelby: re:Trump and vaccines, getting the vaccine out fast was one of his main points while in office... see Operation Warp Speed as well as this soundbite from the October debates https://www.cbsnews.com/video/2020-presidential-debate-trump-coronavirus-vaccine
[11:56:52] <Robomot> Trump insists a COVID-19 vaccine will be ready by the end of the year - CBS News (In the final presidential debate, President Trump was pressed on his comment that there would be a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year.)
[11:56:52] <Shelby> Basically my estimated probability for like all of us dying by AI is like.. 25% in the next 10 years.. and it just goes up to like 90% within 100 years.
[11:56:53] <Shelby> Is this a bad thing to have in my mind, or is there reason to suspect that is heaps incorrect
[11:56:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Buddhism is bad too
[11:57:35] <kuudes> it was interesting to read that some forms of recreational divination in historical japan were also used as ruses for talking about things people didn't want to say out loud
[11:57:40] <feep> seems a bit low an estimate to me, but hey
[11:57:42] <ardent[m]> (The Pfizer vaccine was EUAed in December 2020)
[11:58:36] <Shelby> PapuaHardyNet, a lot of ways. mainly by reminding me that my thoughts arent real and i dont need to believe them. initally i started for increased focus because of my intense adhd.. but tbh now its jsut about enlightenment or a fixed meditative state permanetly because once i had a heart attack and was stuck in this profoundly altered state after
[11:58:37] <Shelby> meditating heaps and stuff... and it was most the best 3.5 weeks of my entire life. So realistically the 'help' isnt that important because i havent been able to get back there and the how it helps me is more dependant on if i get back to that place
[11:58:43] <Shelby> feep really?
[11:58:52] <feep> Shelby: webgpt is a bit scary to me
[11:58:56] <Shelby> Obormot\Arcturus its bad in different wats'
[11:58:57] <Shelby> ways*
[11:59:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nah, a lot of the same ways
[11:59:12] <Shelby> please elaborate
[11:59:26] <Shelby> feep its all scary, but havent heard of this ill look
[11:59:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> You know... oppressing people, giving power to priests, abuses, all that
[11:59:35] <Shelby> what would you put those estimates at then?
[11:59:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Usual religion stuff
[11:59:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Contributing to ethnic/ethnoreligious conflict
[11:59:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> etc.
[12:00:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But also some additional ways, due to the whole meditation thing, that's very bad)
[12:00:02] <feep> *personally*, and this is probably a bad estimate, I'm at 35% in ten years, going to 90 in 30
[12:00:24] <feep> no special insight though, just a sense of imposing barriers getting chipped away at
[12:00:47] <Shelby> oh yeah that stuffs all bad, but i think the core of it is really good. Like i kind of think he was the only philiosopher to ever exist tbh. maybe wittgenstein. but like its the most perfect tool for understanding your own mind and changing your perception of the world (imo... but also it takes like years with no results for most people to get to
[12:00:47] <Shelby> that point so not super practical).
[12:00:47] <Shelby> But yeah thats why i said minus the religiousity of it
[12:01:00] <feep> if you can pick "the core", anything is good
[12:01:02] <ardent[m]> There is always a chance that a sufficiently general AI that can access the web could use an exploit like log4j
[12:01:06] <feep> the core of naziism is good
[12:01:11] <feep> (if you can pick what the core is)
[12:01:29] <Shelby> okay instead of core ill use the fundamental instruction
[12:01:30] <feep> ardent[m]: I don't even mean from a security perspective.
[12:01:37] <kuudes> they were pro healthy bodies, weren't they, feep
[12:01:41] <feep> Shelby: that has exactly the same issue lol
[12:01:48] <Shelby> because i dont mean the general principles or the themes.. i mean like the specific thing he was pointing to
[12:01:50] <feep> ardent[m]: I just mean like ... being able to use a mutable memory instead of an immutable one
[12:02:02] <ardent[m]> oh I meant from alignment too... web GET requests aren't side-effect free, and log4j can turn them into arbitrary hacking
[12:02:13] <ardent[m]> if the right site is used
[12:02:15] <feep> that's been what I've long seen as one of the main limiting factor between gpts and agentic behavior
[12:02:15] <feep> factors*
[12:02:24] <Shelby> wait... can i use webgpt? or no
[12:02:27] <feep> no
[12:02:37] <ardent[m]> no openai is very stingy on releasing things
[12:02:45] <feep> ardent[m]: if you can read from a mutable memory, you're like one clever hack away from having a stream of consciousness that you can then train on
[12:03:14] <Shelby> Soo... Gpt4 will be like the jump from gpt 2 to 3.. and Gpt 7 will simulate alll of existence..? (lol joke stole from joscha bach)
[12:03:18] <ardent[m]> they won't even let you generate human faces with glide or make a chatbot on gpt-3, much less use open web access
[12:03:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Shelby: I assure you, there have been other philosophers... :p
[12:03:24] <PapuaHardyNet> Shelby: thanks for describing your experience with meditation. I've just begun meditating seriously (after a while), and I've become curious to hear other people's experiences
[12:03:25] <feep> so like, webgpt isn't scary because it has web access
[12:03:32] <feep> it would be just as scary if it was reading from an offline wiki dump
[12:04:08] <PapuaHardyNet> GPTX will not be an AI alignment risk imo
[12:04:28] <feep> I don't think webgpt is an alignment risk
[12:04:29] <PapuaHardyNet> RL models, perhaps. Language models? doubt it

[12:04:30] <Shelby> Obormot\Arcturus i dont know if its worth getting into it. but i dont think so. I mean, not really. like i think it wasn't really philiosophy.. but maybe its just sophistry on my part and renaming of philiosophy.. but i honestly dont think what plato or whoever was doing was really philiosophy.. but anyway honestly probs not worth getting into. :P
[12:04:38] <feep> but I think it's one element *less* "not an alignment risk" than gpt-3 was.
[12:05:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Shelby: Plato is hardly a good example to pick! In fact, one of the worst!
[12:05:09] <PapuaHardyNet> what is webgpt? gpt-3 api?
[12:05:16] <ardent[m]> media generation by itself isn't an alignment risk yeah... some might say it's a bias/safety/whatever risk but I personally deaf-ear that concern as long as the generated content is what the user wanted
[12:05:16] <PapuaHardyNet> oh no it is a new model

It is trained to cite its sources, which makes it easier to give)
[12:05:20] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: yeah
[12:05:43] <Shelby> nietzche, aristotle, hume take your pick, but again its probably not worth getting into it. 😇
[12:05:45] <feep> as twitter says, "it's increasingly looking like we're not just failing the AI alignment challenge, but failing it with zero dignity too"

[12:07:45] <ardent[m]> (if GPT-4 can predict protein folding I rescind "*the* good" though)

[12:08:21] <PapuaHardyNet> alignment means the AI will, in the process of optimizing its objective, cause damage
[12:08:27] <ardent[m]> yeah
[12:08:38] <Shelby> Obormot\Arcturus it sounds super elitist and bs and i hate this kind of talk tbh.. but I feel like unless you've had the specific insight which seems to map very well to buddhist literature then it's almost impossible to express why i think that. it's like the distinction of understanding concepts and "knowing" (not intellectually grokking though)
[12:08:38] <Shelby> that you are essentially just a concept and then something happens where all thoughts and emotions become basically empty things that dont affect you. and its a very different paradgim shift (imo.. i may be wrong) then in any other understanding of information whether that be intense thought experiments or philisohopical interepretations etc. But
[12:08:39] <Shelby> yeah ill read that post now thanks for the link
[12:08:41] <PapuaHardyNet> when the AI does what it is supposed to do, and a human deliberately uses it as a weapon, that isn't an alignment problem
[12:09:04] <ardent[m]> +1, if anything the AI not allowing itself to be used as a weapon is a misalignment
[12:09:49] <Shelby> i do have a stupid question though, is there any possibility that christanity was the downfall of rome. Like that being the catalyst? (question to anyone)
[12:09:52] <ardent[m]> (unless it is merely incapable of realizing the user wants such)
[12:10:04] <rmmh> no, not really
[12:10:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Shelby: That insight is wrong though
[12:10:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Shelby: So any philosophers who endorse it are actually the bad philosophers :p
[12:10:48] <Shelby> happy to dm if you want to, but i feel it'd be spammy or hard to express on here without irritaitng others
[12:10:56] <feep> nono keep it here
[12:10:57] <feep> this is fun

I don’t claim I am enlightened, as though I have some amazing property that makes me better than people who don’t have it. I mean simply that there’s something vaguely like a state that our culture calls “enlightenment” that …)
[12:12:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Too slow ;)
[12:12:44] <Shelby> I do think you're wrong or maybe i havent expressed it correctly. and ah yes i've read that and spoken to michael about his post. I think he hasn't actually gotten enlightenment but I do think he has a more refined interepertation of some of the deeper insights available than most
[12:14:35] <Shelby> it is a great post, i think the metaphor of some one unable to look up from their phone was really genius tbh
[12:14:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's a super dumb post :\
[12:15:03] <Shelby> you think? why
[12:15:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Read the comments
[12:15:14] <Shelby> wait why did you link it to me then out of curiosity
[12:15:15] <Shelby> oh.
[12:15:20] *** Joins: thlnz (~thln@user/thlnz)
[12:15:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Most of the interesting stuff on LW goes on in the comments, just in general)
[12:15:59] <ardent[m]> I haven't had true enlightenment but I somehow fell into what one might call a peak experience once (no drugs, and haven't tried them yet, though I'd suppose it was similar in feel to MDMA, and I did feel a mental "minimap" for months afterward), and the best comparison is imagine you discovered masturbation in a world where very few do it
[12:16:04] <Shelby> yeah i know, but theres a lot of comments anything in particular
[12:16:05] <ardent[m]> like both seem a lot like "I pressed up up down down left right left right B A Start and something awesome happened" and people would nod along but think the speaker is a bit nuts (no pun intended), since the result they end up describing is far different from just a logical conclusion of similar actions
[12:16:09] <ardent[m]> And then you, upon hearing this, find yourself wondering why the language used by the few who Know to describe the effect is always so flowery, and then you find out firsthand (I swear, pun also not intended) and try to describe it... and the words that come out are the exact things you heard before, and maybe you realize crossing the inferential distance is impossible
[12:17:20] <feep> I think crossing the inferential distance is possible, but it's a completely different skill to do so by words than by actions
[12:17:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Shelby: Almost all the comment threads on that one are good/useful/interesting
[12:17:43] <feep> and uh, if you take the phone example from the post
[12:18:01] <feep> like, not to take this analogy too far, but have you considered sending them a photo of them looking at their phone
[12:18:14] <feep> like, words can describe mindstates, even unusual ones
[12:18:19] <Shelby> yea and thats basically pointing out instruction in dzogchen
[12:19:35] <feep> personally, this is what worries me about meditation
[12:19:37] <Shelby> or maybe more literal would be douglas hardings on having no head technique. they both are pretty much useless though if you havent developed like ridiculous hours of concentration by doing pointless meditation to notice it though, so yeah i dunno.
[12:19:58] <feep> it's always sort of like: "I used to not understand. then I did a bunch of contortions to my brain, and now I see the world in a radically novel way."
[12:20:05] <Shelby> Again i shouldnt of started this is going to get no where and i probs should of been quiet
[12:20:07] <feep> "and this is good, trust me"
[12:20:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Like, you're not wrong, per se, but also we can drop the pretense and just say "of course he can't explain his insight in words, because there is in fact nothing to explain and his sense of insight is 100% delusion, caused by meditation/drugs/whatever hitting the 'feeling of having an insight' button in his brain, which *we know for a fact is what such things do*"
[12:20:15] <PapuaHardyNet> oh god, it is that phone post
[12:20:17] <feep> dude you just said you changed your cognition, why exactly are you trusting it *more* now
[12:20:34] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: eh, I don't actually think so
[12:20:44] <feep> like, remember the russian meditation paper?
[12:20:55] <feep> actually, do you have a link offhand?
[12:20:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> I... don't?
[12:20:59] <feep> hm hang on
[12:21:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> What Russian meditation paper
[12:21:16] <PapuaHardyNet> https://old.reddit.com/r/meditationpapers/
[12:21:17] <Robomot> Scientific Papers on Meditation (A community to share scientific research about the practice of meditation and mindfulness.)
[12:21:24] <feep> it was linked here a while back
[12:21:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Anyway, as far as changing your cognition, I agree
[12:21:36] <feep> they did like a religion-free semi-scientific project into meditation and there was a thing about like
[12:21:44] <feep> deliberately affecting your radius of focus
[12:21:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: My favorite comment on this was one from one of the SSC posts about this stuff, which went like this:
[12:22:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> "1. Crack lens of telescope.  2. Announce discovery of jagged lines in the heavens."
[12:22:19] <feep> and I can confirm that this is a skill you can learn to do with your mind and I suspect it genuinely has beneficial cognitive benefits on some skills
[12:22:22] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: haha
[12:22:33] <feep> cognitive effects
[12:22:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that just brilliantly sums up the entire thing
[12:22:38] <feep> though I don't know if there's tests for it
[12:22:51] <feep> like, I've seen people do monitor work in a way that makes it pretty clear that they don't have the skill
[12:23:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Huh?
[12:23:06] <feep> hang on! finding pdf
[12:24:56] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, meditation has actual benefits
[12:25:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> *doubt*
[12:25:15] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm not talking about the spiritual stuff
[12:25:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> People say this but it always turns out the "actual benefits" are some truly trivial shit
[12:25:36] <synthmeat> it helps for BPD or other emotional disregulation issues
[12:25:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe, maybe
[12:26:26] <ardent[m]> in my case it was a lot more "feeling amazing for a day or two, enough that I'd easily pay some small but non-negligible fraction of my net worth for a guaranteed repeat, and just being less anxious for some months and more able to get things done and do things" than any kind of radical cognition change, which makes me suspect those who talk of enlightenment refer to something different... my best parallel, though one I don't think many
[12:26:26] <ardent[m]> will remember well, is that those months were all the best parts of the headspace of being a kid
[12:26:45] <PapuaHardyNet> yep! I get your doubts, and it is a very healthy immunization against the constant bullshit in the traditional meditation community and practices
[12:27:09] <feep> I can't find it ;.;
[12:27:09] <feep> it was linked either here or lesswrong
[12:27:09] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: anyway, to tl;dr they basically trained people to deliberately manipulate their scale of focus
[12:27:31] <Shelby> https://pastebin.com/3pZ1ZsiJ
[12:27:32] <Robomot> The thing i had i had lost after the first time i drank. but it was there for al - Pastebin.com (Pastebin.com is the number one paste tool since 2002. Pastebin is a website where you can store text online for a set period of time.)
[12:27:33] <feep> and I think this is one of those innate "programmer skills", or possibly "designer skills" that nobody talks about
[12:27:44] <synthmeat> yes
[12:27:52] <feep> and that's the reason why some people think modern flat UIs are pretty and others find them impossible to use
[12:28:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: You mean like ... visual... focus?
[12:28:05] <feep> yes
[12:28:09] <feep> but the mental component of it
[12:28:13] <feep> not optical focus
[12:28:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have literally zero idea what you're talking about :(
[12:28:29] <feep> this might be a thing where your brain is just weird
[12:28:30] <synthmeat> easier to explain with sounds maybe
[12:28:33] <feep> but um. hm.
[12:28:45] <feep> basically there's a level of scale where people can correlate elements of their visual field
[12:28:52] <feep> and this scale can be manipulated
[12:28:56] <feep> consciously
[12:28:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> synthmeat: It would almost certainly not be easier to explain with sounds, lol
[12:29:13] <feep> imo the loopy puzzle may be a good training tool for this
[12:29:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> The what
[12:29:24] <feep> because it requires lots of local attention, and then scaling up to a bigger pattern
[12:29:25] <Shelby> ardent[m] yeah i think its different, but i think 99.9% of people who refer to enlightenment are basically talking about something similiar to what you are referring to but i dunno i could be wrong and just lying to myself i suppose its always possible ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[12:29:33] <feep> https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/loopy.html
[12:29:34] <Robomot> Loopy, from Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection
[12:29:46] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: anyway, I've seen people take an alphabetic list of names
[12:29:50] <feep> and slowly scan down it line by line
[12:30:27] <feep> and I wanna be like "can't you just [scale up to the 10cmish level, quickly recognize the alphabetic scale of it], and then immediately jump to the right location?
[12:30:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Shelby: What you describe is very similar to what everyone who has these sorts of experiences describes, there's like five descriptions of stuff like this just on that LW comment thread
[12:30:32] <feep> *"
[12:30:36] <Shelby> yep
[12:30:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Shelby: Read Richard Kennaway's comment about "PNSA" or w/e
[12:30:45] <Shelby> it will always be like that
[12:30:46] <feep> but I think they actually can't, and one way to explain that would be lack of conscious control over their scale of focus
[12:30:51] <PapuaHardyNet> wat
[12:30:53] <Shelby> its inexpliciable i honestly think tbh
[12:30:59] <PapuaHardyNet> Shelby did you claim you achieved enlightenment
[12:31:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> No it's totally explicable
[12:31:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> You explained it just fine
[12:31:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's just that it's bad, and not good.
[12:31:10] <Shelby> PapuaHardyNet si
[12:31:11] <Shelby> no i didnt
[12:31:17] <PapuaHardyNet> what is obormot so worried about then
[12:31:21] <Shelby> like nothing about what i said even slightly expresses it tbh
[12:31:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol come on man
[12:31:37] <Shelby> its not like knowledge, like its not like creating a mental simulatuion of a world view thats completely not it
[12:31:48] <feep> it should be isomorphic to it tho
[12:32:01] <feep> tbf I also think that qualia are explicable.
[12:32:25] <PapuaHardyNet> agreed
[12:32:31] <Shelby> lol i watched this video of kids trying to explain colours to a guy blind from birth
[12:32:37] <Shelby> was interesting
[12:32:37] <feep> look dude
[12:32:42] <feep> anyone who sends kids into that
[12:32:46] <feep> is not making a honest attempt :V
[12:32:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Agreed
[12:32:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Ok, interesting
[12:33:00] <feep> yay
[12:33:00] <Shelby> it was like a youtube thing lol it wasn't like as chool or anything
[12:33:07] <Shelby> how would you do it
[12:33:16] <feep> think about it for a week or two first
[12:33:22] <Shelby> i dunno i think one of the kids did better than others and i wouldnt of thought to use like sounds like she did
[12:33:25] <PapuaHardyNet> ooh yeah that's a good one
[12:33:27] <feep> write up a few theories of qualia, make up examples under each of them
[12:33:29] <feep> then go down the list
[12:33:30] <Shelby> she made like an explosion sound for red ahhaa'
[12:33:38] <PapuaHardyNet> shelby, actually try what feep says
[12:33:39] <synthmeat> again, i would use sound to explain it to him, in both ways!
[12:33:44] <PapuaHardyNet> that would be cool to hear
[12:33:49] <Shelby> PapuaHardyNet sorry what did he say
[12:33:53] <PapuaHardyNet> awkward
[12:34:06] <feep> .. the lines are still on the screen :v
[12:34:14] <Shelby> write up theories of qualia?
[12:34:29] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: anyway, that's not meditation of course
[12:34:39] <Shelby> btw i dont think thats the same thing if im honest
[12:34:50] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: but it's the sort of thing of "you can learn to manipulate parts of your conscious mechanism and (untested!) get performance gains from it"
[12:34:56] <Shelby> like i dont think qualia = rigpa mind or enlightenment or whatever you want to call it
[12:34:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Ok, so you're saying that performance on tasks like that can be improved by meditation, or what?
[12:35:09] <feep> non
[12:35:11] <feep> nono*
[12:35:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok...
[12:35:19] <feep> I'm just saying it as an existence proof for the sort of like
[12:35:26] <feep> "sometimes manipulating your mind is good and real"
[12:35:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> How?
[12:35:35] <feep> how can you train it?
[12:35:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure
[12:35:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> What is an existence proof? Maybe I don't get your point
[12:36:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> The fact that people have difference performance on tasks like this?
[12:36:05] <feep> well, as I said, I think loopy *should* train it. anything where you switch from focus on small things to focus on larger things often should train it; hard to think of an example
[12:36:12] <Shelby> how can you ask how to something like that.. isnt playing chess for thousands of hours manipulating your mind in a good and real way?
[12:36:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just "should"?
[12:36:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's your whole evidence? :\
[12:36:22] <feep> I could make a deliberate training tool for it, I guess; it would involve lots of recognizing implied patterns at different scale
[12:36:27] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: it's not much, I know :p
[12:36:30] <synthmeat> feep: again, sounds! solo vs chorus
[12:36:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Shelby: Playing chess for thousands of hours is a huge waste of time :p
[12:36:38] <Shelby> did you call me loopy :(
[12:36:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Um, it's literally nothing, lol
[12:36:46] <feep> Shelby: lol
[12:36:47] <Shelby> Obormot\Arcturus but like if you're a chess cahmpion
[12:36:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Shelby: That would be a waste of your whole life
[12:36:59] <Shelby> then it would be good and useful for you specifically
[12:37:00] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: I mean, it's a thing from my perspective, I was hoping you'd have experienced the same thing in others and would recognize it
[12:37:12] <PapuaHardyNet> obormot: based
[12:37:20] <Shelby> Obormot\Arcturus well waste is subjective.. so out of curious whats a non wasteful life to you. ie whats the meaning of life in your eyes
[12:37:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Unless you're Magnus Carlsen and you parlay your chess championness into merchadising dollars I guess
[12:37:37] <PapuaHardyNet> hey, magnus carlsen is a model too
[12:37:40] <synthmeat> feep: lay off cracktorio
[12:37:53] <PapuaHardyNet> being good looking is far more useful than chess that's for sure
[12:38:15] <synthmeat> people seem to keep underestimate how great is being good looking
[12:38:19] <Shelby> what if the final act before ai subjecation of all humans is one final ai v chess game
[12:38:29] <Shelby> im just fkn around sorry :P
[12:38:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: I don't get it... experienced what? I feel like I've missed something here, maybe it got lost in the chat scroll, but, like, you haven't even mentioned, literally, *any* evidence that this sort of skill can be *changed* or *trained*, right? Forget "with meditation" - just, at all?
[12:38:53] <Shelby> yeah being good looking seems to be pretty good. I'm like verging i think, but i'm glad im not worse looking
[12:38:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: It's just "this is a skill that some people have more than others", right? That's it?

[12:39:56] <synthmeat> i can't buy hats in my size!
[12:39:59] <Shelby> oh no
[12:40:06] <Shelby> im sure theres big hat stores now
[12:40:08] <feep> that could basically only be explained by "they have a tiny focus of attention that they have to laborously move around the monitor"
[12:40:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Yes, fine, granted, some people are better at this than others - we agree there
[12:40:17] <kuudes> grats synthmeat?
[12:40:19] <Shelby> just get a tatto that says 'my head is big because so is my brain'
[12:40:26] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: I agree I've given no evidence it can be trained
[12:40:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Ok

[13:15:59] <PapuaHardyNet> still reading kensho comments, I stumbled upon an interesting idea: what if, what if meditation is a memetic hazard
[13:16:04] <galambo> so if you select 5 front and back, preloader would automatically load tabs that were unloaded
[13:16:12] <PapuaHardyNet> well, enlightenment is a memetic hazard?
[13:16:20] <galambo> 5 to the front, 5 to the back
[13:17:01] <PapuaHardyNet> everyone who has experienced meditation's "benefits" expend enormous energy convincing people that there really is something great that you'll get if you meditate
[13:17:07] <galambo> Obormot\Arcturus, this way if you close a tab you will find the tabs next to it are already loaded

[20:11:10] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : Hmm "I wanna be clear about something else, because there's a lot of misconceptions about this as well but there's no magic, no pixie dust to the M1 that lets the Mac perform in ways that just weren't previously possible. There are just good solid ideas and engineering, for example, just powering up a core on a low power Intel system might burn 15 watts of power on a higher end system maybe 30 watts or more. That's something 
[20:11:10] <two2thehead> unimaginable for an architecture that comes from the iPhone. In that tiny tiny box, you're allowed single digit burn, nothing more. That's why with previous Intel Y series MacBooks, the performance was just so gated, so always. Intel would use opportunistic turbo to try and take advantage of just as much of the thermal capacity of a machine as possible but frequency requires higher voltage, much higher voltage, which draws more power and generates 
[20:11:12] <two2thehead> more heat and Intel was willing to do that to goose frequency and voltage in exchange for bursts of speed and it absolutely let them eke out as much performance as was thermally possible and post as big a set of numbers as possible but it often just wrecked the experience and turned your desktop into a coffee warmer, your laptop into a heat blanket."

[20:19:53] <feepbot> Strike grinds Finnish ports to a halt on Tuesday  | News | Yle Uutiset (The Transport Workers' Union AKT has called a 24-hour strike at all Finnish ports on Tuesday.)
[20:20:09] <kuudes> "Last week AKT initiated a blockade against Keitele Group in support of the Industrial Union's collective agreement negotiations with the company. During the blockade, AKT members did not handle Keitele products at Finnish ports. AKT said Tuesday's collective action is in response to attempts to break the blockade at the Port of Loviisa over Christmas." "The Transport Workers' Union AKT is launching a strike at ports on Tuesday in response to collective 
[20:20:09] <kuudes> agreement disputes involving forest industry company Keitele Group. The 24-hour collective action will essentially stop all port activity."
[20:21:51] <kuudes> ie there is a strike ongoing against a single company which has not agreed on common conditions. as the company tries to circumvent the strike, the logistics union orders a ban on logistics on that company. as the employers try to circumvent the ban, the logistics union orders stoppage of all port processing for a day as deterrence.

[20:27:23] <catern> maybe I can just say "PLEASE email me" etc or maybe i can set up a reward "I'll give you a dollar if you email me rather than twitter message me" or...
[20:27:36] <PapuaHardyNet> add an autoreply to your Twitter DMs asking people to email you instead since you do not check Twitter DMs
[20:27:45] <two2thehead> what PapuaHardyNet said
[20:27:46] <PapuaHardyNet> also, why are you so popular
[20:27:49] <catern> lol maybe

[20:28:00] <catern> PapuaHardyNet: i'm not that popular, it's just happened a few times
[20:28:07] <catern> it just happened again once
[20:28:53] <catern> PapuaHardyNet: also, I don't want to discourage people from twitter-DMing me, if that's what they're comfortable with
[20:29:13] <catern> I just think I could make them more comfortable with emailing me
[20:29:34] <PapuaHardyNet> that's not how it works, people will take the most frictionless option for them
[20:29:36] <catern> i'm glad that I have the twitter account because for all I know they wouldn't contact me at all otherwise...
[20:29:37] <PapuaHardyNet> and that is twitter
[20:29:45] <PapuaHardyNet> hey, what is your twitter username?
[20:29:55] <catern> PapuaHardyNet: they have to google my twitter account, that's much more frictiony
[20:30:19] <catern> maybe I just need to make my email address more prominent on http://catern.com/

[20:35:21] <PapuaHardyNet> oh god, I now have an open window with catern's email on it and I don't know what to write
[20:36:07] <PapuaHardyNet> the awkward thing is that if I was cold emailing catern it would be easy, I know the drill. hot emails are harder because I don't want to email something that's low quality
[20:37:23] <PapuaHardyNet> Hmm. Here's an idea: how about a custom catern-only newsletter? That seems like something that provides value

[20:55:11] <phill> I've found that meditating has a pretty simple benefit for me
[20:57:49] <phill> It gives me a bit of time where I realize I'm about to do something either autonomically or about to get distracted when I'm supposed to be paying attention
[20:59:47] <phill> Eg if someone says something that makes me upset, instead of automatically just saying something mean back to them... gives me a moment where I'm like "oh, I'm about to say something mean" and then I don't do it at all (or choose to do it)
[21:00:33] <phill> Or if I'm in a boring lecture I notice when my mind is about to wander
[21:01:19] <phill> I've also found that Headspace doesn't really help me with this, but silent meditations do
[21:01:47] <catern> muahahaha
[21:01:52] <catern> "If you're uncertain about whether to send something, just send it and if it wasn't good enough, I'll give you $10."
[21:02:06] <pompolic> i discovered something like meditation/Focusing when i was young
[21:02:24] <pompolic> literally just trying really hard to introspect on what the process of thinking is like
[21:03:59] <pompolic> and i think the benefit i derived was being able to pick apart mental "actions" or "events" that would otherwise feel automatic
[21:04:13] <pompolic> it also probably broke my brain so you win some and lose some
[21:04:21] <phill> Yes that's exactly what I'm referring to pompolic 
[21:04:31] <phill> How did it break your brain? 
[21:04:45] <pompolic> well
[21:05:00] <pompolic> if you go around Unseeing stuff all the time then building the abstractions back up
[21:05:05] <pompolic> you'll get weird ontology
[21:06:14] <pompolic> which for one resulted in lot of stress and social anxiety indirectly
[21:07:01] <pompolic> on the other hand i forget people don't have a capability to just...fuck around with the valence of their experiences, so "just don't feel that" makes me sound like an asshole
[21:07:50] <pompolic> finally, i think it made me eminently suggestible, but that's possibly just by default

[21:19:21] <pompolic> actually on the other hand

[21:52:14] <catern> so they don't get $5 :)
[21:52:14] <linear> catern: hmmh I dunno if I get the paying only for 'too-low-quality' messages though, but I'm also unsure if money like that would really be what fixes the cold-emailing thing
[21:52:25] <linear> (like, money is a huge factor in e.g. negotiating, but still people don't do it for social fear)
[21:52:28] <PapuaHardyNet> hey linear!
[21:52:34] <linear> heyo
[21:52:54] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, let me take a minute to think up a good conversation starter
[21:53:03] <linear> what I try to do is just make sure I am not speaking too formally in the context. Instead of "If you'd like to discuss any of these topics, please send me a message" I just say "DMs are super open"
[21:53:20] <linear> (as most people, I still don't get nearly as many cold emails as some may guess, although I do get more cold twitter DMs)
[21:53:32] <catern> (maybe I should say "uninteresting message" instead of "too-low-quality message"
[21:53:56] <PapuaHardyNet> catern: maybe use polarization
[21:54:03] <linear> I feel like email just has a large barrier since a lot of us are used to real time communication mediums now, and it feels like I really *need* something good to say instead of like a 'hey whats up'
[21:54:18] <PapuaHardyNet> describe a specific kind of email that you are always willing to get
[21:54:18] <linear> I think I stopped listing IRC since I hadn't ever found someone that wasn't already on it
[21:54:18] <pompolic> seems true to me
[21:54:33] <pompolic> my issue with emailing seems to be from importing realtime communication priors to email
[21:54:37] <PapuaHardyNet> so for example jacob buckman has pinned a tweet where he says he'll review any paper you send to him
[21:54:40] <linear> also maybe could link to some good posts on it like Guzey on 'you should do more cold emails' I dunno
[21:54:49] <PapuaHardyNet> now that's specific - I recall it very clearly because it is so specific
[21:55:13] <catern> PapuaHardyNet: interesting
[21:55:16] <PapuaHardyNet> so I guess a part of it is that your open invitation needs to be memorable if you want people to think, "hey, let me email this dude named catern"

[21:56:50] <PapuaHardyNet> keep in mind that most cold messages you'll get this way may not be high signal - that's a part of your greater outreach
[21:56:52] <linear> I also wonder for people that get larger inflows here, what percentage of their important social networks (personal/professional/etc) are from these cold communications rather than other means
[21:56:58] <PapuaHardyNet> it's like dating, except it isn't soul crushing

[21:58:37] <PapuaHardyNet> gwern has a very popular website, some people have very active twitter profiles
[21:58:38] <catern> sure, just remember that my original problem here was people sending me twitter DMs rather than emails

[21:58:54] <catern> despite my website with my email being far more developed than my twitter
[21:59:14] <PapuaHardyNet> man, just roll with it, or send them an autoreply
[21:59:21] <PapuaHardyNet> that's the two options you have
