[01:58:55] <eldowan> I'm trying to build a docker image on my amd64 linux workstation for an arm machine, and am not sure where to start. Can someone point me in the right direction? I see a lot about buildx but that seems geared toward docker desktop for mac and windows. I'm intending to deploy on an Arm Cortex-A8 if that's relevant
[02:01:51] <artok> first you need to add binfmt
[02:02:22] <artok> docker run --rm --privileged docker/binfmt
[02:02:37] <artok> (I think it was that image name)
[02:03:06] <artok> then you can start from different architectures, for example docker run --rm arm64v8/alpine uname -a
[02:03:18] <artok> it should output aarch64 for you

[02:34:43] <LordKalma> problem: the container now only stops after 10 seconds
[02:35:08] <artok> that is just bad

[02:36:36] <artok> sleep loop might be better than tailing null
[02:37:10] <LordKalma> tried with sleep infinity as well
[02:37:51] <artok> real question is... why to keep container alive if there is no service running?
[02:38:03] <LordKalma> there isn't on the entrypoint :) 
[02:38:19] <artok> "to be able to exec into it" is just bad way of thinking
[02:38:28] <LordKalma> hahah yeah, not that
[02:38:38] <artok> write entrypoint that has some real service
[02:39:38] <zoredache> LordKalma: you have a CMD with sleep infinity and it doesn't stay alive?  Is there a 'sleep' binary in the image?
[02:39:48] <LordKalma> it stays alive
[02:39:55] <LordKalma> the problem is that it doesn't want to shutdown
[02:40:01] <LordKalma> only after the 10 seconds docker waits to kill it

[02:43:13] <artok> ok so what is the purpose of the container ?
[02:43:21] <LordKalma> it's my dev container (for now)
[02:43:28] <artok> overengineering something ?
[02:43:40] <zoredache> I mean if I do a docker run --rm -d debian:bullseye-slim sleep  infinity that container just stays around forever, not sure why your container would be stopped after 10 seconds, that doesn't sound normal.
[02:43:58] <LordKalma> zoredache, no, it doens't stop after 10 seconds
[02:44:09] <LordKalma> the problem is that it *only stops*`after 10s on a down command

[02:44:55] <LordKalma> yes, I do.

[02:45:12] <LordKalma> it was easy, just changing the killsignal to SIGINT

[02:45:20] <LordKalma> but here that ain't solving it
[02:45:32] <LordKalma> (ah, and using exec <command> instead of <command>)
[02:45:33] <artok> persistent data is there on named volume
[02:46:29] <artok> so no need for exec into dev environment, as that is already started on tty interactive mode

[02:51:04] <zoredache> I wonder if the container shuts down faster if you pass `--init` when you create the container, I think that starts an init in t he container that handles signals.
[02:51:27] <eldowan> Thanks for the pointers artok and LiENUS, I'll take a look over the next few days. Trying to understand buildx today is turning my brain to mush for some reason.
[02:52:45] <artok> zoredache: tini is there yeah
[02:52:53] <artok> https://github.com/krallin/tini
[02:53:32] <LiENUS> @artok, sorry i didnt provide more info before i had to go, https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/
[02:53:38] <LiENUS> that pretty much does it all
[02:53:45] <LiENUS> buildx kind of replaces docker build
[02:54:25] <eldowan> Wow! I hadn't heard of tini. I've been having problems with ffmpeg running in a container not respecting sigs or silently failing and docker not restarting the container even when set to always. I'm going to have to play around with that.
[02:54:45] <LiENUS> they reccomend using `docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install all` to set up qemu
[02:55:31] <eldowan> oh ffs, I have no idea why I didnt' even check out the docker docs about buildx. All the things i was reading were from just after release. This looks more understandable.
[02:55:37] <artok> LiENUS: that was my question, as macOS one has binfmt running already, for linux hosts that addition is vital
[02:56:20] <artok> but yeah still is valid to run that support for qemu binfmt

[18:53:03] <bn_work> hi, docker 20.10, I have Dockerfile with `SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-xc"] ENTRYPOINT ["nohup", "/entrypoint"]`, no CMD.  `/entrypoint` is a symlink to a bootstrapping shell script.  However, when I run the container with -d (background mode), the container is stopped.  Checking `docker ps -a` shows it exited cleanly (with 0) and `docker logs `<container_hash#> shows some output from the script but I need more info to troubleshoot it so 
[18:53:03] <bn_work> I want to interactively run bash in it and test it manually.  If I try to `docker container start -ai` <container_hash#> it just gives the same output as `docker logs `<container_hash#>.  Is there no way to override the entrypoint w/o creating a new container and overriding the entrypoint?

[19:12:47] <tabakhase> all working as expected
[19:15:07] <tabakhase> i guess you think you want -it or so, but that smells very wrong in a lot of ways... if you want a shell on a tzhing that runs, exec is your friend...

[19:22:56] <programmerq> bn_work▸ if a container needs a tty and to be backgrounded, you can do 'docker run -td ...'
[19:23:28] <programmerq> I have run minecraft servers with 'docker run -itd' in the past. That way I can come later and 'docker attach' and then issue minecraft commands if needed, and then detach with ctrl+p ctrl+q
[19:29:13] <programmerq> but generally speaking, the nohup doesn't belong-- it just sounds like you said that it works when attached, but not when backgrounded.
[19:29:25] <programmerq> and with nohup, it seems more like it'd fail either way

[19:46:01] <ikke> pull the image, tag it for the other registry, push it

[19:50:27] <ph88> when i try to pull from the old repository i get "no basic auth credentials"  ... i might have some credentials somewhere when i look for them. Is there a command to enter credentials ?

[23:48:27] <eldowan> armv7l
[23:48:35] <eldowan> I guess that'd be armv7 then
