[02:17:00] <kagevf> I want to expose a swank port within my local network ... is that a slime/swank thing, or an OS (Linux) thing?
[02:17:12] <kagevf> ... if anyone happens to know ...
[02:36:36] <pjb> kagevf: normally all ports are visible on the LAN. If not, it's because you have an iptable filter in the OS.
[02:37:10] <pjb> kagevf: however, you will have to start the swank server on an interface connected to the LAN, not just on lo0.
[02:38:29] <pjb> kagevf: something like (let ((interface "192.168.0.42")   (port 4042))   (swank:create-server :interface interface :port port))
[02:38:43] <pjb> assuming ifconfig|grep inet gives you 192.168.0.42 on the lan interface.
[02:39:09] <pjb> you should also be able to use (let ((interface "0.0.0.0")   (port 4042))   (swank:create-server :interface interface :port port)) to listen to all interfaces.
[02:39:45] <pjb> kagevf: be sure to use tcpdump port 4042 to understand the security implications of doing that.
[02:40:09] <pjb> (but you said local network)
[02:40:21] <pjb> (but nowadays local network go thru wifi, and wifiâ€¦)
[02:53:27] <kagevf> thank you, pjb .... I think that did the trick, but I got "Can't locate module: SWANK-IO-PACKAGE::SWANK-TRACE-DIALOG" ... almost like it's expecting something to be available on the remote system I'm trying to connect to
[02:55:55] <kagevf> ok ... found a possible solution on google for that error message ... I will try it later
[02:56:05] <kagevf> this is what I found btw: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58048752/connecting-to-remote-swank-cant-locate-module-swank-io-packageswank-trace-di
[02:56:23] <kagevf> almost there! :)
[03:05:13] <pjb> Yes, I never saw that, but  (swank-loader:init :load-contribs t) is logical.
[03:05:47] <pjb> You may have to push paths to swank::*load-path* (for contribs) perhaps?
[03:05:54] <pjb> in ~/.swank.lisp
[03:06:04] <pjb> Good night.
[03:28:17] <kagevf> thank you again pjb I'll keep that in mind
