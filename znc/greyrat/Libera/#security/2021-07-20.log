[08:04:11] <Guest76> I feel like everything going to be so secure
[08:04:15] <Guest76> That things basically cant be hacked
[08:04:24] <lousiF> you need one of those fancy cover letters that most employers seem to need
[08:04:28] <Guest76> Super walled garden apple style, super ASLR, Anti exploit etc
[08:04:33] <Guest76> I jsut use .txt file resumes

[08:05:21] <lousiF> if it feels too secure, then something isn't right
[08:05:38] <Guest76> I think eventually everything will be like Iphone
[08:05:43] <Guest76> Only approved, scanned apps able to be installed
[08:05:50] <Guest76> Even windows, scans all downloaded and running files
[08:05:52] <lousiF> or we've gotten lulled into a false sense of security
[08:05:53] <Guest76> with SmartScreen
[08:05:59] <Guest76> or, system can be really secure
[08:06:15] <Guest76> Consider how easy it was to install viruses onto computers in the Windows XP, 7, days compared to Windows 10
[08:06:31] <Guest76> Windows Xp was remote compromise or 1 click webbrowser exploitket, java drive by
[08:06:55] <Guest76> Windows 10 has like 3 clicks you have you run to run the file
[08:07:04] <Guest76> Open file, allow through smart screen, etc
[08:07:09] <lousiF> I can never run windows again
[08:07:12] <[iz]> things certainly progress with computers and OSes, etc
[08:07:12] <Guest76> Agreed
[08:07:20] <Guest76> Yeah Windows 10 is super secure compared to old versions
[08:07:25] <[iz]> but we are also having more and more non-computer devices connecting to the internet now

[08:07:55] <Guest76> Yeah but we have fixes for most common 2010 era security bugs
[08:08:06] <lousiF> I don't care how nice the graphics are on the solitaire cards in the new windows
[08:08:06] <Guest76> Its not like unpatched bugs
[08:08:33] <Guest76> I think Linux needs to step up its security

[08:08:49] <Guest76> Sandboxing by default somehow
[08:09:02] <[iz]> sometimes it is, depends on when the firmware image for that device was made and if it has a way to update it
[08:09:03] <lousiF> flatpaks..
[08:09:14] <Guest76> Flatpak itself is easily bypassed
[08:09:20] <Guest76> and allows an entry vector into the OS
[08:09:31] <Guest76> because flatpak is trusted
[08:09:35] <Guest76> once flatpack is hacked
[08:09:37] <Guest76> root access
[08:09:38] <Guest76> or similar
[08:09:41] <lousiF> just use an OS image once and delete it
[08:09:41] <[iz]> IoT = lots of dumb embeddede devices on the internet
[08:09:44] <lousiF> every day
[08:10:31] <Guest76> Yeah but a LIVE USB for example
[08:10:34] <Guest76> can be compromised
[08:10:52] <Guest76> but I agree a live Usb system would be most secure probably
[08:10:55] <Guest76> such as Tails os
[08:10:56] <lousiF> not if it's encrypted
[08:11:09] <Guest76> Well, when its running its probably decrypted in order to work
[08:11:15] <Guest76> meaning the files running can be infected
[08:11:20] <Guest76> leading to persistant infection
[08:11:26] <ajak> what about ASLR needs to be improved?
[08:11:34] <Guest76> IDK just an example
[08:11:39] <Guest76> I've seen new types of ASLR with Windows 10
[08:11:44] <Guest76> Bottom-up ASLR, etc
[08:11:48] <lousiF> Tails is ok, even just as an offline tool
[08:11:58] <Guest76> My point is I think there are more advanced forms of ASLR aviable

[08:13:37] <lousiF> other than some other people's personal habits
[08:13:46] <Guest76> What technical issues does Tails have?
[08:14:46] <lousiF> when connecting to tor, then opening the tor browser, JS is enabled and the home page is always tails.boum.org
[08:15:01] <lousiF> you'd think they'd have a .onion by now?
[08:15:12] *** Joins: kikijiki (~Thunderbi@user/kikijiki)
[08:15:19] <ajak> isn't js is enabled by default in the tor browser?
[08:15:39] <ajak> disabling it will make you more fingerprintable
[08:15:48] <Guest76> Yes I agree 100% with that
[08:15:50] <lousiF> even when you change the security level in the gui settings
[08:15:51] <Guest76> loisF
[08:16:00] <lousiF> you have to change it in about:config
[08:16:04] <Guest76> Default Homepage should be a blankpage.
[08:16:14] <lousiF> you're right
[08:16:19] <Guest76> Im going to mention it
[08:16:26] <Guest76> The Tails homepage could be exploited to infect tails users
[08:16:32] <Guest76> via Quantum insert or website hack
[08:16:36] <lousiF> but why haven't they made their own page a .onion ...?
[08:16:50] <Guest76> even as a .onion the website could host exploit code
[08:16:51] <lousiF> kinda odd, nobody really thought of that. lol
[08:16:54] <Guest76> Safest option is a black homepage
[08:17:03] <ajak> these seem like nitpicks more than anything really serious
[08:17:37] <lousiF> plus, WiFi should be disabled by default
[08:17:55] <Guest76> WiFi is alright IMO, mac address spoofing is used
[08:18:07] <ajak> yeah, you need to be able to actually connect to the internet
[08:18:17] <lousiF> but it still gathers nearby SSIDs
[08:18:26] <Guest76> new tails has default OBFS4 bridge snow
[08:18:28] <Guest76> bridges now
[08:18:31] <Guest76> but they didnt work for me
[08:18:39] <Guest76> OBFS4 bridges have never worked for me on tails

[08:19:54] <lousiF> it's 750$ for 5g now I guess

[08:35:09] <lousiF> then it forked itself
[08:35:32] <Guest76> One concern of Monero

[09:02:55] <Guest76> But how do U check balance
[09:04:00] <lousiF> you can see with the public key
[09:04:10] <Guest76> Nice
[09:04:21] <lousiF> but the private key never goes onto the internet, or a hard drive
[09:06:04] <lousiF> even if you have like 20 bucks

[09:45:52] <soulisson> I have a question related to pth attacks. Why are they called that? Is it because the attacker provides a hash to the client instead of a password or is there another reason?
[09:47:05] <Guest76> google it friend
[09:48:07] <soulisson> Guest76, I did, I used the attack. I want a confirmation
[09:49:06] <Guest76> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_hash
[09:49:24] <Guest76> pass the hash is a hacking technique that allows an attacker to authenticate to a remote server or service by using the underlying NTLM or LanMan hash of a user's password,
[09:49:43] *** Quits: plankers (~plank@user/plankers) (Quit: No Ping reply in 180 seconds.)

[09:52:21] <Guest76> 'pth attacks. Why are they called that? Is it because the attacker provides a hash to the client instead of a password' Yes, "pass the hash is a hacking technique that allows an attacker to
[09:52:21] <Guest76> authenticate to a remote server or service by using the underlying NTLM
[09:52:22] <Guest76> or LanMan hash of a user's password,"
[09:52:33] <soulisson> My question is about the terminology and the reason the technique/attack is called that way. It seems, it's because instead of providing a password to the client, the attacker provides a hash. It seems to check with the fact that  Paul Ashton modified the smb clietn to accept a hash.
[09:52:45] <Guest76> yeah
[09:52:57] <Guest76> pth is using a hash to authenticate instead of a password
[09:53:07] <Guest76> There you pass the hash to authenticate, isntead of a password
[09:55:16] <Guest76> Muslims call me Infidel
[09:55:18] <soulisson> ok, so MITRE describe the attack as an authentication attempt. So I guess the attack itself is trying to authenticate against the server and providing/passing the nt hash to the attack tool should be considered a preparatory step.
[09:55:33] <Guest76> yeah
[09:56:57] <soulisson> other religions came with the term first

[11:36:41] <mats1> moving upstack a bit, traceability of btc has been widely panned and misunderstood
[11:37:38] <mats1> i mean yes, if you use fiat to buy btc from an aml/kyc exchange and then send to an unsavory party, you'll probably get pinned up
[11:39:54] <mats1> but most btc businesses will take deposits, operate their own internal ledger, and upon withdrawal pay you out using whatever combination of utxos will result in the lowest fees, which means there's no circuit on the blockchain proper, and the only way to know about it is if the proprietor gives it up, which may or may not happen

[11:51:39] <mats1> incidentally, binance is one of the biggest btc businesses around, and in part because of their size, they've been taking heat from usg for 'facilitating money laundering'. this is lulzy because they are... just doing what most every other business does - take money in exchange for services, and then pay out deposits when asked by customers

[12:28:54] <mats1> it is, in the parlance, a monetised good, because of its physical properties that made it useful for commerce, and created an incredible, historical, wide-ranging network effect

[12:36:15] <piou> It's a system. Just like a computer system, a set of arbitrary rules and conventions that has bugs but mostly works and hopefully can be updated to something better.

[12:37:55] <mats1> you're high if you think those numbers relate to anything in reality, like gdp

[12:38:19] <piou> You keep trying to tell me that it's a bad metric, but that's not the point
[12:39:08] <Joanna> Also the pricing of some things is abnormally low which puts farmers out of business because they can’t compete with big conglomerates
[12:39:19] <piou> When talking about monetary theories, that's how inflation is discussed, and that's a major part of monetary study. It's a metric that makes sense at the theoretical level and that could be useful at the practical one too if properly measured which is extremely hard. It does not encompass everything but that's a choice economist made.

[12:45:12] <piou> I suppose that by monetary inflation you mean a measure of how much money is in the economy. If that's the case monetary inflation would be useful if more money caused price inflation, but without that correlation monetary inflation is a useless metric because who cares if there's more money as long as it doesn't have any effect?

So not formal sure, but I spent my fair share of hours studying the topic and exposing myself to different opinions as well as the original thought of the great names.
[12:53:52] <weedmic> too much money = inflation, too little deflation/depression - it matters.  Im saying that one can use gold for the measure.  I have bought a kruggerand every month since i was 5 or 6.  the price changes - someday i'll have a vault like the addams

[13:30:31] <weedmic> pay the lord - let's say they want to build a town near dordrecht, they can't just tkae a few square km from the owner - they have to pay for it.  if they decid they can' that lord is going to fight back/resist.
[13:30:59] <piou> I think mats1's point is that you don't need to take their money or land if they just gamble it away

[13:33:53] <weedmic> perhaps you do not know what an investiture is.
[13:34:40] <mats1> i.e. OBE? 'order of the british empire' ?

[13:45:22] <weedmic> in the case of the UK, the monarchs were often poor - they setup a deal where they would give over control of their money to a group, not know how it was invested, etc., then from that - based on who they were/how they ranked they would get money - they call it an investiture - perhaps the english woort might be allowance - execpt it is all your money - but b/c some would squander it - access was removed.

[18:22:18] <marder> true.
[18:23:09] <piou> For open wifi frankly the best is probably to pay the $25 of a rasberry pi and install an openvpn on it. That way you'll get a vpn that you manage for free (aside from the initial cost of a dirt cheap computer)
[18:23:33] <TimMc> Yeah, I used to tunnel everything to my home server, a raspberry pi.
