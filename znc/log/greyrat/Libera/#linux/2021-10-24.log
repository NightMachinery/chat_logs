[01:11:09] <ayecee> ok
[01:11:34] <steerpike> but dump.txt only retains info from the last boot
[01:11:44] <ayecee> what should it do instead
[01:11:58] <steerpike> it should append
[01:12:04] <steerpike> hence why i used >> instead of >
[01:12:06] <ayecee> it does append
[01:12:15] <ayecee> something deletes the files in /tmp on reboot
[01:12:26] <steerpike> what's that something else
[01:12:31] <ayecee> if you want something to survive reboot, use /var/tmp or some other more permanent location
[01:12:47] <ayecee> i don't know offhand what that something else is

[02:00:33] <hime> so valid and might work, but not conceptually different from using aufs?
[02:00:38] <ayecee> no.

[02:02:00] <lovetruth> ayecee, I can remount the overlay
[02:02:08] <lovetruth> And pivot_root and chroot

[02:02:21] <lovetruth> That is how I'm doing it right now
[02:02:27] <ayecee> lovetruth: you can, and then you'll have an overlay composed of sda1 and sdb1, which both must remain present

[02:04:30] <ayecee> not gonna take advice that you won't use yourself
[02:04:41] <hime> so the process I was going with was trying to create the union fs (so that software doesn't notice anything in the change like if I were to remount ro and rsync, etc), then make the union fs be "equivalent" to sdb1, then you could have sdb1 mounted a second time somewhere, move that to be the new root, and tear down the union fs and anything else
[02:04:44] <lovetruth> ayecee, indeed. But I'm using --bind or mv for that. The File identifier can be taken care of either just by using mv, or the --bind option (depending on the end goal)

[02:06:03] <ayecee> hime: i've explained as well as i can why that won't work, but it doesn't seem to register. could be a communication problem on my end.
[02:06:07] <lovetruth> Anyway - all these worked for me because I have the "PID 1" (my own "init" file)
[02:07:11] <ayecee> hime: and who knows, maybe it will work. i've been wrong about these things before.
[02:07:17] <lovetruth> And I can make my "init" execute any command (I used some mkfifo file for that)

[02:07:50] *** Joins: Taoki (~MirceaKit@188.240.8.134)
[02:08:02] <hime> the only problem is that my prior methods are not in any way invisible to applications, since I lock the drive down during the whole operation
[02:08:05] <ayecee> lovetruth: different problem, i think. your initramfs use is a common use, where nothing else is running at that point.
[02:08:15] <hime> lots of software will not like that, and I would hope to avoid it
[02:08:57] <ayecee> lovetruth: hime's hypothetical example has him replacing the disk while other software is running.
[02:09:08] <lovetruth> hime, if you're using overlays with some temps - then the root filesystem will look like it's mounted rw
[02:09:15] <hime> well technically I lock down portions of it at a time, since my actual use case is not a single large partition for everything, but it's the same idea (partitions for /, /boot/, /boot/efi/, /var/, /usr/, and /home/)
[02:09:49] <hime> lovetruth: yes, that would be the idea, since applications will constantly be trying to both read and write
[02:09:52] <ayecee> hime: the programs remain tied to executable on the disk they were launched from.
[02:10:11] <ayecee> you could make an overlay, but the running programs would continue to run from the original disk.
[02:10:15] <lovetruth> ayecee, right, not many services started - but I did start a few. And also - this includes running from another image (the encrypted one), which can be somehow like "another disk", I guess?...

[02:11:44] <hime> what things had a problem with was when, for /home/ in particular, it was locked down as readonly for an hour or so during the swap

[02:15:54] <lovetruth> Theoretically - there seems to be no real problem so far for the files that have the exact same content on the "new disk" as the "limbo" ones
[02:16:35] <lovetruth> But if I want to reload some config files with - let's say - "safer" ones... then it seems a little trickier... :)
[02:16:46] <ayecee> yeah, it's mostly that the mmap pointing to the original executable, and libraries, have to be removed and new ones added in their place.
[02:16:55] <hime> ayecee: if a copy of the same file is in the same place in the new location, you should be fine, but if it was deleted previously and is simply being held in memory, it might be trickier
[02:17:00] <ayecee> hime: nope
[02:17:28] <hime> possibly related to why some software might freak out a bit

[02:26:06] <ayecee> hime: it may be overly technical, but it's not the same file. if the process modifies the file it has open, those changes aren't reflected in the one you've copied.

[04:55:23] <lostchild> _
[04:55:24] <lostchild> This question is addressed more to advanced arch users, since I have no clue how to work around one issue. Tried finding answers all across different forums and was googling appropriate guides but non of them work as needed. I am not a networking expert, only basic knowledge.
[04:55:24] <lostchild> _
[04:55:24] <lostchild> Issue: I have 3 Mobile Broadband Modems (Huawei 353), connected to the host machine via USB. I need to assign every modem to a different user on the same host, so that every user could have a completely separated internet connection. When modems are in idle state(connected to host, but not in use), I tried connecting one modem per user at a time. Hence, logged in into the user1 -> connected modem1 -> logged out. Logged in into
[04:55:24] <lostchild> the user2 -> connected modem2 -> logged out. And what I found out here, when logged in into user2 and the modem2 was chosen, this modem2 was also automatically assigned to user1. Hence, the kernel simply connects all users to only one modem chosen.
[04:55:24] <lostchild> _
[04:55:26] <lostchild> I went a step further, and decided to set up different Network Namespaces. I created 3 groups, for every group I created 2 virtual interfaces(veth1, veth2, veth3, veth4, veth5, veth6) for each group, moved modems1-3(enp0s20f0u1, enp0s20f0u2, enp0s20f0u3) to corresponding groups(1-3) along with created interfaces(1 per group) the rest 3 interfaces were left in the main Network Namespace. Thereby it looks this way

[12:47:55] <rendar> simply to enable it
[12:48:14] <hexnewbie> systemctl edit example.service # add ‘[Service]’, ‘Restart=on-failure’ and ‘RestartSec=60s’, and then the service will automatically restart every 60 seconds when enabled

[16:01:28] <katp32> it's been a long time since I've worked with bluetooth on linux but if I'm not mistaken the bluetooth daemon doesn't handle audio *at all*, it just facilitates setting up connections, and the actual audio function is handled by pulseaudio. maybe I'm wrong, though

[16:09:45] <katp32> pulseaudio always seemed a lot of trouble for me, idk, like ALSA is also incredibly broken but pulseaudio is "broken and the solution is always black magic" vs "broken and the solution is hidden in a 15 year old doc page somewhere"

[16:37:53] <katp32> TJ-: indeed, but worst case scenario the system doesn't boot and has to, well, reboot. not a big deal
[16:37:54] <rendar> ok then what kind of power management service can i try to stop then? with systemd
[16:38:14] <ananke> rendar: out of curiosity, is this a new or an existing problem? as in, did it appear lately, or was it always present since the install?
[16:38:38] <katp32> opal: that's indeed what I was asking, whether (on systemd systems) it's still a seperate service or if it's a built in reimplementation
[16:38:38] <rendar> ananke, well, unfortunately i can't tell you if i had this before, because i was using another machine
[16:39:00] <opal> "never" is not the answer here, if you disable acpi functionality then you have no way to respond to overheating events or control fan speed or anything of the like
[16:39:03] <katp32> rendar: sorry, to clarify, has this machine *ever* run linux without issue?
[16:39:11] <opal> but as long as youre aware of that, it's fine to disable temporarily for debugging
[16:39:41] <ananke> rendar: logs should indicate when it started happening. using another distro, say a live one, would be a good quick way to determine if the problem is with your current one

[17:01:26] <TJ-> hime: katp32  yes, that'll be udisksd

[17:29:23] <katp32> 11mbps is still much much lower than I'd expect, though
[17:30:36] <hime> not actually surprising to me, nor is it surprising that it would be surprising to someone else

[17:58:34] <hexnewbie> katp32: Possibly. Speed usually drops when youtube-dl has downloaded part of the video. I assume it's how it serves videos to web browsers, so that they have enough of the video buffered locally, and then decrease the speed to something suitable for normal watching.

[21:07:44] <hime> katp32: sounds about right - maybe I'm mistaken, but I've noticed that package dependencies have become extremely aggressive these days, and I could swear it wasn't always this way
[21:07:47] <katp32> akik: but ntfs has no mechanism to store unix permission data, cause it's ntfs?

[22:39:30] <CoolerX> I only need the terminal really
[22:39:35] <hexnewbie> Burkuf: Writing zeroes is unlikely to help. qemu can be made to understand discard, which means you could use fstrim after that
[22:39:49] <Burkuf> VMWare says you need to fill with zeros
[22:40:04] <CoolerX> it's nice to have a GUI for Firefox
[22:40:17] <ayecee> where does vmware say that
[22:40:28] <hexnewbie> Burkuf: That's a non-standar dalternative to trim. I'd still try fstrim first, then zerofree if that doesn't work.
