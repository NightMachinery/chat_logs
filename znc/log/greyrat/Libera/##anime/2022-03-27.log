[01:25:50] <Bco1981> yeah, close
[01:26:22] <MootPoot> well, I'll write it out so its a little more clear
[01:27:41] <MootPoot> ISP coax ->XB7 DOCSIS 3.1 unit (AP/normal mode)-> TP link AX90 unit = 920-950 mbit/s

[01:29:12] <MootPoot> sec
[01:30:36] <MootPoot> oh wait
[01:30:37] <MootPoot> nvm
[01:30:41] <MootPoot> I can't do it like that
[01:31:00] <MootPoot> in non bridge mode XB7 to PC also gets 950 or so

[01:31:54] <MootPoot> I mean, I guess I could just run it in AP mode but then I have to deal with forwarding ports through two devices
[01:32:01] <MootPoot> which is a royal pain
[01:33:00] <Bco1981> well you need to test without anything else on and a pc directly while in bridge-mode to confirme the XB7 can do it
[01:33:07] <MootPoot> you, like
[01:33:11] <MootPoot> no, like*
[01:33:14] <MootPoot> thats not possible
[01:33:22] <MootPoot> when in bridge mode it works only as a modem
[01:33:28] <Bco1981> yeah ?
[01:33:37] <MootPoot> so it cant connect to anything
[01:33:42] <MootPoot> no DCHP server
[01:34:17] <Bco1981> is the xb7 staticly configures ip addres, subnetmask and gateway on the WAN side ?
[01:34:23] <Bco1981> then just use that on the pc
[01:34:32] <MootPoot> I...idk about that
[01:34:37] <Bco1981> it's dhcp
[01:34:45] <MootPoot> I think the ISP assigns it
[01:34:48] <MootPoot> not the unit
[01:34:54] <Bco1981> your pc should be able to connect directly in bridge mode
[01:34:59] <MootPoot> I tried
[01:35:01] <MootPoot> dosent work
[01:35:11] <Bco1981> maybe wait 10 minutes before connecting
[01:35:21] <Bco1981> the dhcp lease at the isp has to timeout
[01:35:29] <Bco1981> that's how it usually works
[01:35:59] <MootPoot> no, like - if its already in bridge mode and working with the AX 90 ( but slowly )
[01:36:05] <MootPoot> if I plug my PC into that
[01:36:08] <MootPoot> it wont work
[01:36:10] <Bco1981> that or some times you can call the isp an say you have changed unit so please clear
[01:37:52] <Bco1981> i had DOCSIS 3.0 modem some years ago. when i put it in bridge mode, i had to call them to please clear the mac address. and my own router would work fine.
[01:40:52] <Urchin[emacs]> emmeka: I think you overhyped "the scene"
[01:42:07] <emmeka> :(
[01:42:21] <MootPoot> it isen't yuri so you probably didn't care for it as much
[01:42:25] <MootPoot> :\
[01:43:19] <Bco1981> MootPoot: something else i would make sure of is, putting a managed switch between the XB7 and TPlink. to see if they link up with 1gbit full duplex
[01:43:26] <Bco1981> both*
[01:43:31] <MootPoot> they are linked up with 2.5gbit
[01:43:50] <MootPoot> the tp link confirms it
[01:44:29] <Bco1981> interesting, the modem can do 2.5gb ethernet...
[01:44:42] <MootPoot> the highest speed my ISP offers is 1.5gbit
[01:45:41] <Urchin[emacs]> but when I finish my dress up darling, I will have finished more shows in a month than in the last year and a half
[01:46:00] <Bco1981> well, basic testing... get one step at a time to work as expected.

[07:42:30] <dfch> from another cat site (rip my digital footprint and future cat ads): Many cultures associate cats with nine lives. The Egyptians were the first to come up with this theory, and China and Japan followed, also believing the myth about cats‚Äô nine lives.

[07:42:30] <dfch> less than 9.

[08:40:09] <MootPoot> the only real issue with fast charging is heat really - most devices are designed so that fast charging is either 1.) slow enough that it does not overheat 2.) it charges fast enough that it does not have the time to overheat ....even if it does get too hot the phone will reduce the charging speed
[08:40:47] <amigojapan> MootPoot: the power bank was extremly cheap at daiso, but seems to be good quality. Price does not always correlate with quality
[08:41:54] <MootPoot> amigojapan: it does to a degree
[08:42:16] <MootPoot> amigojapan: its possible that the bank is the same quality or is just overstock material

[09:50:47] <MootPoot> I know
[09:50:52] <MootPoot> he does that with coffee too
[09:51:01] <MootPoot> fucking 7/11 coffee
[09:51:01] *** Quits: Roey (~Roey@user/Roey) (Quit: Client exiting)
[09:51:07] <MootPoot> 40% sugar
[09:51:22] <bxgelsan> MootPoot: "man, this folgers sugar milk is esquisite"
[09:51:27] <MootPoot> pffft
[09:52:13] <bxgelsan> MootPoot: probably s&d or some other company providing the ground beans
[09:52:22] <MootPoot> I mean, I'm not particularly good either, but at least I have a v60 and a burr mill
[09:52:23] <bxgelsan> well, dunkin uses s&d, i cant remember if starbucks uses it
[09:52:33] <bxgelsan> a lot of gas stations use it too, its super cheap coffee
[09:53:24] <bxgelsan> MootPoot: i just drink puerh and water and sometimes cold brew coffee
[09:53:43] <amigojapan> MootPoot: what Is 40% sugar? I don't put sugar in my tea or coffee
[09:54:03] <MootPoot> amusingly enough, the reason why I have a v60 is because my phone is also a v60
[09:54:17] <MootPoot> and while seraching up v60 I kept on getting results for the hario v60
[09:54:24] <MootPoot> amigojapan: the canned stuff you buy
[09:55:13] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you keep in accusing be if things I don't do. I hardly ever buy canned coffee.i hate that stuff
[09:55:31] * bxgelsan becomes self aware
[09:55:36] <MootPoot> didn't you say you go get coffee/tea from the kombini
[09:55:40] * bxgelsan throws rice at MootPoot 
[09:55:47] <MootPoot> we had a entire discussion about this
[09:55:59] <bxgelsan> MootPoot: shhh, it never happened.
[09:56:01] <bxgelsan> :p
[09:56:03] <MootPoot> and you said you wont make it at home becasue tomako does not want you using the tap water
[09:56:08] <MootPoot> so you go buy it
[09:56:21] <amigojapan> MootPoot: the 7 11 brewing machine grinds the beans and brews it right there and then. It is fresh coffee
[09:56:35] * MootPoot presses x on the quality of those beans
[09:56:48] <MootPoot> but I guess that's better then nothing
[09:56:52] <MootPoot> starbucks*
[09:57:01] <bxgelsan> MootPoot: i mean it describes every coffee setup
[09:57:04] <amigojapan> MootPoot: they are beans from Brazil
[09:57:49] <MootPoot> amigojapan: I mean more about the machine ...no idea how it cleans itself internally - you might have just leftover coffee from the previous 5 million uses
[09:57:52] <MootPoot> stuck in tehre
[09:57:54] <amigojapan> Starbucks is shitty and expansive compared to 7 11 coffee MootPoot 
[09:58:18] <MootPoot> hey, if its any consolation 
[09:58:20] <MootPoot> >you keep in accusing be if things I don't do.
[09:58:25] <MootPoot> you do this to me all the time as well
[09:58:34] <MootPoot> when it comes to topics of linux and windows :p
[09:58:41] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I suggest you don't complain about something you don't know so will
[09:58:51] * MootPoot just ordered 200 more v60 filters
[09:59:32] <amigojapan> Well*
[09:59:33] * bxgelsan continues to be themself
[09:59:40] * bxgelsan waits for next month to order stuff
[09:59:47] <bxgelsan> xD
[10:00:01] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I never said I like canned coffee
[10:00:02] <MootPoot> I think each cup of coffee I get costs me about 0.4 dollars or so
[10:00:32] <MootPoot> .11 for the filter, then the rest for milk and coffee
[10:00:48] <bxgelsan> dunno what it cost me. I been aging them. Value at the time. or estimated value now?
[10:01:21] <amigojapan> That is about half the price of a standard 7 11 coffee. And cream is free
[10:01:22] <MootPoot> unless you have like a 100kg of them I doubt its a significant amount
[10:01:23] <dfch> does hover to play feature count as a view on youtube?
[10:01:44] <MootPoot> the biggest cost for my coffee is just the price of the cream I use

[13:03:49] <Sadale> Based on my online research, I'm leaning towards not doing that. But I'm just curious on if you've got experience on that :P
[13:03:56] <dfch> depends on wifi hardware

[13:12:15] <Sadale> :o
[13:12:54] <Sadale> dfch, just to confirm. Is that creating a WiFi AP? And can it piece thru a concrete wall or door?
[13:13:07] <Sadale> There's two kind of wifi. STA mode and AP mode.
[13:16:25] <dfch> Airetos AEX-QCA9880-NX + mPCIe extender though. because its too fat :P
[13:16:53] <dfch> and of course running in ap, why would I want my box in station mode?
[13:19:22] <dfch> concrete wall/door is somewhat ok, it was terrible with diy antennas, but after I bought 3 6dBi RP-SMA dualband antennas it went from terrible to ok

[15:15:28] <Sadale> dfch, hmm. follow up question. Assuming that I'm using linux, how does soft router AP using AEX-QCA9880-NX compares with a full-ledge router? Is there any limit of configuration like not being able to start both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz AP at the same time? or not being able to setup multiple guest networks? Is the signal strengh any worse than an average full-ledge router?
[15:16:07] <Sadale> dfch, Here's why I'm asking this. I'm thinking about replacing both my raspberry pi and the router with a software router. But I'm rather worried about the wireless capability of the soft router.

[19:51:54] <name100> the less children you have, the less close you are to god. therefore having zero children means you are as far away from god as possible. having infinite children is a never ending process which means you will never attain 100% closeness to God

[22:19:52] <Omega037> Dragonball is prob his favorite at the moment
[22:20:19] <Zoidberg> Omega037: I think he'd like tower of god too.
[22:20:50] <Zoidberg> Omega037: yu yu hakusho is also good
[22:21:44] <Omega037> I only get stuff I know is okay
[22:22:20] <Zoidberg> check them out, they are not just okay, they are really good
[22:22:24] <Omega037> Unfortunately, even most kids manga has sexual/pervy themes
[22:22:44] <Omega037> Like Naruto has transforming into naked woman
[22:23:00] <Omega037> Dragonball has pervy Master Roshi

[22:23:35] <Bco1981> Omega037: which is why i'm very selective of what my 13year old son may watch.
[22:23:40] <Omega037> My son is 8
[22:23:43] <Zoidberg> there aren't any in yu yu hakusho and tog that I think of
[22:23:53] <Omega037> I actually don't mind too much on the content side, within reason
[22:23:57] <Bco1981> have told him, I!, have to know what he has found and plans to watch.
[22:24:06] <Omega037> I don't think reading Dragonball will make or break him
[22:24:48] <Zoidberg> at this age, it's better to let them read books
[22:24:50] <Bco1981> my son has touretts and ADD... i have to "screen" what he want's to watch
[22:25:38] <Bco1981> correction... not have to. i want to screen it.
[22:26:23] <Zoidberg> I think a good start is poetry of Walt Whittman
[22:26:42] <Zoidberg> does anyone enjoy Walt Whitman here?
[22:27:46] <Zoidberg> Omega037: Introduce him to P.G. Wodehouse!! you gotta do that otherwise it's injustice

[22:32:10] <Nanobot> Be sure to expose your kids to normal, healthy sexuality, or else they'll end up like me and have their sexual awakening with gender bender anime, horror movies, and Disney cartoon animals.
[22:32:33] <ButterNoodle> dont forget the furry shit
[22:32:47] <Bco1981> Disney cartoon animals?
[22:32:55] <Bco1981> donald duck ?
[22:33:35] <Nanobot> I remember watching the scene in American Tale 2, when the sister mouse was dancing and her skirt kept going up, and I was wondering why I liked looking at that so much.
[22:33:59] <isekaijin> How usable is Android as a desktop operating system?
[22:34:09] <ButterNoodle> ?
[22:34:18] <isekaijin> I want to try Android-x86 on a spare laptop.
[22:34:22] <ButterNoodle> its meant for touch screen portables with dog shit apps...

[22:34:51] <Bco1981> i had some old Phantom comic book. in it, a lady for some reason i can't remember, lifts her dress and there is all bush.
[22:34:56] <ButterNoodle> its ok Nanobot.. its just a mouse
[22:35:17] <ButterNoodle> no one will know
[22:36:41] <isekaijin> Seriously, what's pissing me off right now is that Windows now has two different places for changing settings.
[22:36:56] <isekaijin> The usual Control Panel and the newfangled settings app.
[22:36:57] <ButterNoodle> yea?
[22:37:14] <isekaijin> Moreover, the Control Panel keeps changing between Windows versions.
[22:37:21] <ButterNoodle> you need to ask yourself why ur still using windows then
[22:37:41] <isekaijin> I'm using an Android emulator that only runs on Windows and macOS.
[22:37:50] <isekaijin> That's literally why.

[22:38:15] <ButterNoodle> bend over and take it because u "need" windows - otherwise she will take the kids, house, and half of everything you own including ur retirement.
[22:38:37] <ButterNoodle> if u choose linux...
[22:38:42] <Zoidberg> Omega037: the way he plays with the language, the plots, the extended similes..
[22:38:52] <ButterNoodle> she doesnt mind if u dress her in a different distro
[22:39:15] <ButterNoodle> shit you probably have her on ur phone in ur pocket right now
[22:40:20] <isekaijin> Uh, superuser.com now suggests that the Control Panel settings get shuffled around between minor Windows builds, never mind major releases.
[22:40:24] <Zoidberg> ButterNoodle: if you choose linux, it's like isekai harem monagatari
[22:40:31] <ButterNoodle> yes
[22:40:32] <isekaijin> It's almost like Microsoft *doesn't* want you to use the Control Panel.
[22:40:44] <Zoidberg> ButterNoodle: all the different distros would be begging you
[22:40:50] <ButterNoodle> I have more than 50 linux installs.. they dont mind sharing me
[22:41:01] <Zoidberg> lol
[22:41:05] <ButterNoodle> and I cant even remember all their hostnames...
[22:41:13] <ButterNoodle> imagine that
[22:41:28] <isekaijin> That's why you should set the hostnames to your waifus' names.
[22:41:30] <Zoidberg> hostnames are forever!!
[22:41:52] <ButterNoodle> isekaijin: and just number them... hachikuji1 to infinity?
[22:41:55] <ButterNoodle> thats bothersome
[22:42:01] <isekaijin> You only have one waifu?
[22:42:04] <isekaijin> What the fuck, man?
[22:42:14] <ButterNoodle> oh
[22:42:21] <isekaijin> I have at least 3-4 waifus per franchise.
[22:42:24] <ButterNoodle> I missed the s'
[22:42:35] <isekaijin> Yeah. s', not 's.
[22:42:46] <vegii> I support waifu monogamy

[22:43:03] * Urchin[emacs] recalls the fuss about waifu monogamy on reddit a few years back

[22:44:13] <isekaijin> hah
[22:44:35] <Bco1981> MootPoot: there... it is done. kde-plasma is now a option.
[22:44:43] <Zoidberg> only one waifu for me, Milly Thompson from Trigun
[22:45:09] <Bco1981> but damn she thicc (kde-plasma)
[22:45:40] <Bco1981> xfce install 7.2gb, kdeplasma install... 12gb
[22:46:30] <isekaijin> Yeah, Plasma is bloated.
[22:46:58] <vegii> gnu is bloat
[22:47:03] <isekaijin> If we ignore Mathematica and LaTeX, 12 GB is more than the amount of space used by all the other programs I use together.
[22:47:54] <Bco1981> i like to keep my OS tight...
[22:49:14] <Zoidberg> nope plasma isn't bloated, it runs fine
[22:49:17] <isekaijin> Well, Plasma isn't an OS, it's ordinary user space software.
[22:49:41] <vegii> akonadi is terrible
[22:50:05] <Bco1981> i don't see the 5gb better stuff in it...
[22:50:16] <Zoidberg> the thing is it's linux, you could configure it a lot
[22:51:01] <Zoidberg> Bco1981: you'd be surprised how much you can remove in the gui
[22:51:09] <Zoidberg> I mean uninstall
[22:51:27] <isekaijin> Wouldn't it be better to simply not install what you don't need in the first place?
[22:51:48] <Bco1981> that's why it's a option...
[22:51:50] <isekaijin> When you partially uninstall stuff, you risk breaking some of the stuff you don't want to remove.
[22:51:54] <Zoidberg> yeah but some distros do install all the shit
[22:53:08] <isekaijin> IIRC, MATE was supposed to be a continuation of GNOME 2, right?
[22:53:22] <Zoidberg> sure that's one risk but if you know what that package does and little search on internet to see if you need that, it's fine
[22:53:24] <isekaijin> Is it relatively lightweight compared to other DEs?
[22:53:27] <Bco1981> that was the idea, from what i heard.

[22:57:36] <isekaijin> Has there been any attempt to make a GUI toolkit natively based on web technologies?
[22:58:12] <isekaijin> So, no like Electron, which ‚Äúleeches‚Äù on a browser implementation that uses another toolkit's lower level foundation.
[22:58:32] <isekaijin> Or are webshits simply too dumb to program native applications?
[22:58:53] <Zoidberg> you mean like chromebook?
[22:59:52] <isekaijin> If I understand Chromebooks are designed to be constantly connected to the Internet.
[22:59:58] <isekaijin> If I understand correctly,*
[23:00:24] <isekaijin> But I'm not talking about that. I mean a serious GUI toolkit for writing serious GUI applications that don't depend on an Internet connection to do actual productive work.
[23:01:25] <Zoidberg> I see. I don't know.
[23:01:57] <Zoidberg> I remember gnome apis are now written in js
[23:02:47] *** Joins: Teacup (~teacup@user/teacup)
[23:02:49] <isekaijin> I'm willing to hold my nose and tolerate JS as long as the GUI toolkit is native.
