[06:18:57] <gtlsgamr> nice
[08:39:15] <iamak[m]> Where can I check my mouse/trackpad settings in Arch + dwm setup? I want to disable sticky right click or something (basically when I right click and hold the button down, I can select options from submenu by releasing button)
[08:39:26] <iamak[m]> I don't know what to search for online
[08:43:05] <AryaK[m]> wiki.archlinux.org/wiki/libinput?
[08:43:14] <AryaK[m]> s/wiki/title/
[08:46:08] <iamak[m]> I already checked it. Didn't find anything
[10:30:40] <smud[m]> afaik it should be implemented by touchpad drivers
[10:30:54] <smud[m]> Maybe you can check if your drivers support it
[10:31:04] <smud[m]> `xinput --list-props <device>`
[10:32:47] <smud[m]> I think the right click hold is standard bevhaviour, so most likely hardcoded with no options to disable
[10:33:19] <smud[m]> If I release the right button, and then right click on any option, it still selects it
[10:37:13] <iamak[m]> smud[m]: Yes but if I slightly move the mouse, it detects it as right click hold
[10:39:10] <iamak[m]> <smud[m]> "`xinput --list-props <device>`" <- Thanks. Found the property
[10:42:31] <iamak[m]> smud: thanks a lot! I was able to disable it

[15:16:48] <Klisper[m]> Guys how do i make nsxiv copy images to my clipboard
[15:16:50] <Klisper[m]> ;-;
[15:17:02] <Klisper[m]> i mean its just sxiv but has some features
[15:27:15] <NeoVoid[m]> <iamak[m]> "smud: thanks a lot! I was able..." <- tried using same keyhandler script?
[15:27:29] <iamak[m]> What keyhandler?
[15:27:41] <iamak[m]> I simply used `xinput -set`
[15:36:25] <Zbnssn[m]> <NeoVoid[m]> "tried using same keyhandler..." <- Yeah this is literally in the default path
[15:36:55] <Zbnssn[m]> /usr/share/sxiv/exec/key-handler
[15:37:11] <Zbnssn[m]> or nsxiv
[15:55:04] <NeoVoid[m]> <iamak[m]> "What keyhandler?" <- its a file where you configure input keys with sprcific functions to them
[15:55:12] <NeoVoid[m]> s/sprcific/specific/
[15:56:00] <NeoVoid[m]> like ctrl + w set current opened image as wallpaper
[16:19:27] <theo[m]12> <Klisper[m]> "Guys how do i make nsxiv copy..." <- as everyone mentioned, try the key-handler script
[16:19:27] <theo[m]12> as for me, i use ranger a lot, so i did this:
