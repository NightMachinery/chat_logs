[00:05:10] <danieldg> Sauvin: basically more efficient rsync by using the FS to diff instead of looking at all files
[00:05:23] <Dan39> danieldg: what do you mean "the raid1 is better than md-raid1"?
[00:05:25] <danieldg> (but only if you send the whole subvolume)
[00:05:29] <Sauvin> THAT could be handy in a network situation!
[00:05:55] <danieldg> Dan39: if you have one drive with incorrect data, it actually notices that and looks at the other drive

[04:57:19] <zer0python> but I've heard GPL v3 has weird things. and I'm pretty sure it prevents mixing of open source and propriatary software. There's also the GPL library one that allows for linkage, but GPL itself doesn't, iirc.
[04:57:52] <zer0python> Like Libgmp uses the library one
[04:57:55] <MinusOne> I think that one is the LGPL?

[05:39:43] <dntreou> Hello everyone, I have fedora 34 on my main PC, just 30 minutes ago suddently  I got a black screen with a cursor blinking... I restarted I had no internet access even though I was connected to the router, after doing some debbuging I realised the issue is that something happened with my DNS configurations, after researching on google I foudn that there were few threads from other peopl using fedora
[05:39:45] <dntreou> facing something similar, I tried their suggested solution with no success, when I do resolvectl dns I get as my response the following  https://defuse.ca/b/LAsAU9ZAa6l22IIywqP2pS I should say at this point that I am able to ping dns servers such as 8.8.8.8 but if i try to ping google ro something I get a response saying that "Temporary failure in name resolution". I have set on the networkmanager
[05:39:47] <dntreou> in the [main] section as suggested dns=none so it will not update /etc/resolv.conf and it does not update it, but when I run resolvectl dns i get what I just showed you above, could this be reding it from somewhere else? any help is greately appretiated
[05:39:50] <sybariten> hey hey, is anyone here using glances for process monitoring? I get the impression that one should be able to scroll through processes with a highlight bar, with the cursor buttons... but mine just quits

[05:43:41] <MinusOne> Tor browser is configured well out of the box, but only routes traffic in the browser through tor.

[07:20:57] <sheep> walterwhip: which "open" command?
[07:21:01] <zer0python> blei: which is basically a list of libraries that the project uses. As a developer you should have a good sense of what your project contains. -- I would think Python should have something similar.

[07:21:34] <sheep> walterwhip: right, but which implementation of "open"? Which distribution are you using?
[07:21:45] <walterwhip> iterm2 on a mac with zsh
[07:21:46] * zer0python is guessing you went to college. (back then it was Java (it took over the market), now it's Python, (and that seems to be taking over the market.))
[07:22:00] <walterwhip> but I also have a debian machine I work on a lot
[07:22:05] <walterwhip> also zsh
[07:22:07] * zer0python *shrugs*
[07:22:32] <zer0python> well, back when I was younger, my IRC buddies we're studying Java at school.
[07:22:40] <zer0python> s/we're/were/

[12:19:34] <joo-_> now look what you have done
[12:20:15] <Sauvin> bullgard4, in retrospect, maybe I should have said "comes with a CLI front end or wrapper" rather than "client".
[12:20:34] <Sauvin> There's absolutely nothing to say that an entire engine cannot be contained within a single library.
[12:20:57] <Sauvin> Or even that an entire RDBMS cannot be contained within a single library.
[12:21:24] <Sauvin> Another case in point would be something like the Berkely DB, although I'm not sure how you'd classify the CLI interface to it.
[12:21:53] <Sauvin> (also, I don't think of the Berkeley DB as being "relational")
[12:22:29] <Sauvin> Ultimately, it's really a matter of semantics. Even if we can't describe exactly what these things are, we *know* what they are, where and how they're useful, and how to use them.

[22:12:55] <Elw3> point being, this files are rarely used, it makes little sense for the system to update them if not neccesary.
[22:13:40] <Elw3> BUT i know for fact that sometimes reading this file can cause the kernel to use a ton of cpu, so reading it like 100 times a second might be a bad idea.

[23:49:56] <sebastorama> juliaEnv: go to a tty, then stop the GDM service
[23:50:22] <juliaEnv> sebastorama yes, that is the right solution. So, I'll execute "service gdm stop", right?

[23:50:44] <sebastorama> I really doubt that GDM will make any difference, but yeah
[23:51:00] <juliaEnv> hmm, I'm not sure which window manager it is running.
[23:51:11] <juliaEnv> somewhere I've read "service lightdm stop"
[23:51:30] <rascul> stopping the dm will bring down whatever x sessions are running
[23:51:39] <sebastorama> juliaEnv: lightdm will be on xfce based environments
[23:51:45] <rascul> might be you can just stop display-manager.service
