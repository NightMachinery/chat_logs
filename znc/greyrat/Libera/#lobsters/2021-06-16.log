[03:49:04] <technomancy`> ngoldbaum: hm; not super surprising
[03:49:12] <imode> what was he promoting.
[03:49:16] <imode> just like, his blog.
[03:49:27] <ngoldbaum> his blog or stuff his company did
[03:50:01] <technomancy`> he seemed like ... 90% reasonable but myopically hyperfocused on nothing but tcl
[03:50:57] <imode> what makes tcl so great?
[03:51:23] <technomancy`> it's smol
[03:52:13] <imode> define smol.
[03:52:19] <imode> you still need a parser for it.
[03:52:47] <technomancy`> no
[03:53:03] <imode> wat.
[03:53:14] <imode> you do, don't you?
[03:53:30] <technomancy`> I mean, I'm not going to defend it; I'm just repeating what I've heard
[03:54:08] <imode> that was more genuine curiosity.
[03:54:12] <technomancy`> I don't think it's actually so great, and the creator of TCL has some really misguided ideas about languages
[03:54:21] <technomancy`> cf osterhout's fallacy
[03:54:40] <technomancy`> a lot of the nonsense around "scripting languages" can be traced to his propaganda
[03:54:50] <imode> what's the fallacy?
[03:55:07] <technomancy`> basically people found that it was very fast to write code in TCL, but the code ran slowly and was difficult to maintain
[03:55:21] <technomancy`> so he was like "well, that's because of an inherent tradeoff in language design"

[20:50:03] <manicennui> There are already multiple editions, and I'm sure people will end up stuck on some old edition eventually, so you'll have to know different subsets of the language.
[20:50:07] <manicennui> Plus the language is huge.

[20:51:46] <manicennui> companion_cube: Sure, but there are many other areas that could change over time.
[20:51:47] <companion_cube> no SFINAE
[20:51:49] <hoistbypetard> From the perspective of someone with a very large mass with C++ code written since 1994, who's just acclimating to rust... it does not feel well on its way to C++ level of complexity to me
[20:52:01] <companion_cube> no templates, really

[20:52:15] <manicennui> companion_cube: You provided some article a while back showing that there have been a large number of small changes.
[20:52:19] <manicennui> Small changes add up.
[20:52:24] <companion_cube> except when they don't
[20:52:38] <companion_cube> a lot of it is additions of small functions to the stdlib (like even C does)
[20:52:45] <iDrougge> technomancy`: You make it sound difficult.
[20:52:51] <companion_cube> some is "this corner case is now possible when before it was rejected"
[20:52:56] <manicennui> That article differentiated between stdlib changes and language changes I believe.
[20:53:05] <companion_cube> some is "this is now usable at compile-time"
[20:53:23] <companion_cube> some is about obscure tag to use C-compatible representation or memory layout
[20:53:39] <companion_cube> the only big changes since 2015 are: better borrow checker (edition 2018), and async
[20:53:50] <manicennui> I don't understand how you don't see that that is exactly how these languages become complex.
[20:53:54] <companion_cube> async is very complex, but sadly it's hard to avoid having something like that now :/
[20:54:02] <manicennui> All you need is enough of these things, and some groups of people will use them.
[20:54:04] <companion_cube> manicennui: what's your reference point of sth not complex?
[20:54:14] <companion_cube> these things compose well, that's the idea
[20:54:25] <companion_cube> (well. except async. async is a mess.)
[20:55:03] <manicennui> Without commenting on the quality of the language, Go is actually fairly simple.
[20:55:16] <companion_cube> ah, i see.
[20:55:22] <companion_cube> yes, but it punts all complexity to you
[20:55:34] <companion_cube> apparently stuff like "nil interfaces" also aren't that simple

[20:56:53] <companion_cube> it builds on .NET… it has to
[20:57:59] <manicennui> I also think I'd rather deal with concatenative languages than memorize another order of operations tables.
[20:58:50] <technomancy`> OO is baked pretty deeply into the .NET runtime I guess?
[20:58:53] <manicennui> But my preferences would be s-expressions.
