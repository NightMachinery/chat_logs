[19:09:20] <yanmaani> jwpapi: still doesn't make sense
[19:09:29] <yanmaani> the way it works in cloud mining is it starts off by money moving from you to them
[19:09:35] <yanmaani> always remember that
[19:10:41] *** Joins: arcatech (~arcatech@user/arcatech)
[19:11:39] <s17> and probably some minimum withdrawal nonsense
[19:14:19] <earnestly> yanmaani: I assume that's the point; they charge you for access to hardware that gives you a chance at winning the block lottery
[19:14:36] <earnestly> Without you having to pay for the hardware up front
[19:14:43] <earnestly> Then they take a cut
[19:15:30] <yanmaani> earnestly: yeah, but this is obviously a scam
[19:15:42] <jwpapi> I’m having a tough time handling all my altcoin friends ☹
[19:15:42] <yanmaani> the quickest way you can tell it's a scam is because of the fact that prices aren't stated upfront
[19:15:57] <yanmaani> the second quickest way is to observe that they also deal in dodgy cloud hosting
[19:16:36] <jwpapi> I’ve done mining with genesis before and in the end I had more than if I would have invested directly in the coin
[19:16:39] <earnestly> If you're refering to something in particular then sure, that may be the case
[19:17:18] <yanmaani> Yeah, but it's still a product sold at a markup
[19:17:30] <yanmaani> if it were profitable to do it, people would do it until it weren't
[19:17:34] <jwpapi> yanmaani: That’s true. I would prefer having it on my own
[19:17:51] <jwpapi> but I’m a nomad without a residence so I can’t buy the same thing on my own
[19:18:05] <earnestly> I'm not sure what 'at a markup' means, exactly.  In the sense that everything does this because they're taking a risk
[19:18:17] <jwpapi> Also they might have power price advantage and/or cooling advantage
[19:18:25] <jwpapi> earnestly: it means they make some of the profits you would make
[19:18:39] <yanmaani> jwpapi: they make all and then some of the profits you wouldn't make
[19:18:44] <earnestly> jwpapi: That seems reasonable
[19:19:24] <yanmaani> There's no profit to be made here. The way it works is the same as everything. First, you make ASICs. Then, you use them *for your own use* until they're no longer profitable, or sell to your friends. Only then do you dump on retail.
[19:19:30] <yanmaani> So cloud mining is obviously a scam.
[19:20:15] <jwpapi> You can pretty much calculate your hash rate
[19:20:20] <earnestly> Can you think of any other reason?
[19:20:42] <jwpapi> why would the bank loan you money for  real estate when they could just buy it on their own?
[19:21:00] <earnestly> jwpapi: > laughs in blackrock
[19:21:59] <jwpapi> I think for a cloud company it’s a simple calculation they estimate all their cost for equipment,power and maintenance, they add their markup and sell it to you.
[19:22:05] <earnestly> Why would a company rent tools when they could just use the tools to do the work?
[19:22:39] <jwpapi> You then have to compare your costs vs the expected coins you mine. This is a bet on the difficulty growth.
[19:23:02] <earnestly> Oh, apparently taproot is a thing now
[19:24:32] <jwpapi> For me it’s not a scam if it’s transparent. The question an intelligent investor has to ask himself. How much would I make if the difficulty stays the same and then how slow has it to grow to be still a better investment to me than to buy coins directly
[19:25:25] <earnestly> jwpapi: You may not have the money to run the mining yourself
