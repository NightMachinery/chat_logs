[09:22:24] <[Syntax]> now after adding bnc.freenode.net to my list of servers Im able to connect again, but my hostmask is no longer resolving
[09:27:36] <quesker> lol freenode
[09:30:13] <[Syntax]> yeah, they seem to be on a mission to piss everyone off, first a takeover, then deregister all the channels and nicks, and now whatever they did today with the SASL requirement
[09:31:09] <bookworm> and you didn't get the first 2 lessons and are still there why exactly?
[09:34:14] <[Syntax]> some channels didnt migrate..
[09:40:46] <[Syntax]> hmm my hostmask didnt resolve here either..
[09:44:53] <[Syntax]> looks like its because my domain is ipv6.. 
[09:46:03] <bookworm> it did?

[09:47:29] <[Syntax]> my znc is configured with a domain that is on an IPV6 address..
[09:47:48] <[Syntax]> that hostname is my shell providers IPv4 address that its failing over to
[09:48:57] <bookworm> that doesn't mean that it didn't resolve though, just that you connected to upstream via ipv4 then
[09:49:15] <[Syntax]> man, you seem to only come back with remarks, and no helpful information.
[09:49:21] <[Syntax]> [Syntax]> looks like its because my domain is ipv6.. 
[09:49:39] <[Syntax]> I think I already established that..
[09:49:39] <bookworm> a domain has no relation to a transport protocol
[09:50:02] <bookworm> it can have via dns a aaaa or a entry but that's it
[09:50:59] <Ders> [Syntax], sasl can be configured in znc
[09:51:14] <bookworm> and that does not mean that only because you access znc via ipv6 that suddenly znc can't talk ipv4 to an upstream server

[17:16:02] <duude__> hey people
[17:16:05] <duude__> pretty stupid question
[17:16:14] <duude__> I'm connected to 5 servers now and about 60 channels
[17:16:23] <duude__> but something happened and I have to completely restart znc
[17:16:31] <duude__> how to do it.. safely?
[17:16:49] <duude__> to retain all channels, (non stickied ones too)
[17:18:07] <Andrio> duude__, you can restart ZNC with /znc restart; I believe SIGTERM works too.
[17:18:26] <Andrio> what happened though?
[17:18:29] <Andrio> You sure it isn't recoverable?
[17:19:03] <duude__> Andrio: I'm running it in docker and I need to assign a docker path
[17:20:26] <duude__> basically
[17:20:31] <duude__> do you have any ideas for easily reading logs?
[17:25:53] <Andrio> ah, ok
[17:27:32] <Khaytsus> Just make sure you send a save to znc
[17:27:49] <Khaytsus> If you _just_ end it, it likely will not have saved for who knows how long.  It doesn't seem to save automatically in my experience.
[17:28:22] <Khaytsus> I experimented once a year or so ago, made a few changes, 2-3 days later the config file had not changed yet
