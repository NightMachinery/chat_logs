[02:50:15] *** Quits: kakashiAL (~kakashi@ip-37-201-199-1.hsi13.unitymediagroup.de) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[02:50:15] <peteyboy1> entuland, the 'rendering' part was decided by those who gave SSR its name, so i guess we have to look into what they mean with that
[02:50:16] <Slade> peteyboy1, its not just that. one of the biggest things is the result is easier for a search engine to analyze, read, etc.
[02:50:19] <wroathe> peteyboy1: At the end of the day server-side rendering is a buzzword. What they're talking about is having the server operate like it did long before javascript-only front ends were even really possible. Let's say you've got a product page for a store front, and the user types http://www.foo.com/products/13234 into their address bar. The browser sends a GET request for that resource to the server, and
[02:50:25] <wroathe> the server then queries the databse for that product and generates a full HTML page and sends that as a response back to the browser. The browser then parses that, turns it into DOM, and renders the page
[02:50:54] <entuland> there seems to be a bit of mixing things up, something can be vanilla JS and be client side or server side, vanilla is about using built in facilities vs using, say, jQuery
[02:50:58] <wroathe> peteyboy1: The act of generating that HTML is sometimes referred to as "server-side rendering", to juxtapose it with "client-side rendering", which is the act of querying the server for data, and then using Javascript to generate that DOM to render the page.
[02:51:37] <peteyboy1> wroathe, ok, so i was pretty close with what i said to Slade? would that just be using .send in node?
[02:52:23] <peteyboy1> entuland, ok, i guess it goes deeper then
[02:52:24] <wroathe> peteyboy1: In a client-side rendering scenario the browser would load a basic EMPTY html page that just loads some javascript, and that javascript would send an AJAX request for that product's data to the server. The server would query the database and send back the data in a format like JSON, and Javascript on the client would then use that JSON data to construct the DOM tree and render the page.
[02:52:52] <entuland> meh, using "rendering" to mean "generating the markup" looks like an unnecessary confusion to me, I don't like it
[02:53:02] <entuland>  /rant :P
[02:53:52] <wroathe> peteyboy1: In the former scenario (server-side rendering) Javascript doesn't need to do any work to construct DOM nodes on page load. It just finds the already constructed DOM from when the browser parsed the response HTML, and binds event listeners
[02:54:08] <peteyboy1> could rendering and painting be synonymous? with rendering basically meaning 'preparing what will be painted'?
[02:54:08] <wroathe> peteyboy1: In the latter scenario Javascript does all of the work to construct the DOM and bind the listeners
[02:54:17] <entuland> in addition to the above examples, if you care about your page being less error prone, avoid client-side generation of the markup
[02:54:22] *** Joins: elastic_dog (~elastic_d@2a01:118f:822:9c00:2132:cd52:1e4a:f46a)
[02:54:46] <entuland> I don't like painting there either, from my POV the rendering / painting is done by the browser after all the markup is generated
[02:54:49] <wroathe> peteyboy1: "rendering", on the server, means constructing the HTML response to a request.
[02:55:15] <wroathe> peteyboy1: on the client, "rendering" means constructing the DOM tree from data
[02:55:28] <wroathe> They're confusing nebulous buzz-words
[02:55:32] <entuland> yeah
[02:56:05] <peteyboy1> i THINK i get it
[02:56:26] <wroathe> peteyboy1: Like many things though, this is a big topic, and the considerations involved touch on every aspect of web application architecture
[02:57:20] <peteyboy1> wroathe, sometimes i feel the pressure to know them all, or at least understand them all
[02:57:24] <peteyboy1> is it justified?
[02:57:38] <entuland> yeah, you shouldn't let that pressure affect you
[02:57:42] <wroathe> Depends on what you want out of live, I suppose
[02:57:46] <entuland> know what you need for what you need to do
[02:57:46] <wroathe> life*
[02:58:03] <peteyboy1> i meant within reasonable periods of time, of course
[02:58:08] <wroathe> peteyboy1: You'll pick up most of it with experience and maintaining a constant level of effort to learn new things
[02:58:17] <peteyboy1> of course 10 years from know i would at least like to know a little bit about all of that
[02:58:41] <entuland> it takes far less to get the overall picture and be productive - mastering is a different thing
[02:59:03] <peteyboy1> but basically what i want to know is, is it something i should consider? if so, in which case?
[02:59:33] <wroathe> peteyboy1: Btw, the way those two seemingly unconnected definitions of "rendering" are connected is that in both scenarios you're conceptually binding "data" to a "template"
[02:59:53] <entuland> the more resilient approach is to have markup generated by the server and only rely on client side JS to improve the user experience
[03:00:02] <wroathe> peteyboy1: On the server, it's binding data to an HTML template, and on the client it's binding data to routines that construct DOM nodes
[03:00:21] <entuland> some things can't be done without JS on the client side, but the basic functionality should preferably work, if at all possible, with JS completely turned off on the client
[03:00:27] <peteyboy1> just to see if i got it right. SSR doesn't nullify many of react's benefits, does it?
[03:01:21] <entuland> I don't know enough of react to be able to tell about that
[03:01:58] <entuland> but if react somewhat forces you to use client side markup generation, then I don't like it :P
[03:02:29] <wroathe> peteyboy1: Well, it goes back to having a philosophy. I firmly believe the best way to build a web application is to make it work with HTML, CSS, and HTTP alone, and then to augment it with Javascript. There's nothing limiting about this. For example, you can make it so that if your user types that product URL into their address bar it loads the full page from the server, and then Javascript takes

[03:02:35] <wroathe> over and binds event listeners to the navigation, such that when a user clicks the link to go back to the "Catalog" page Javascript handles routing to the new page with the  History API, requests data for the catalog page from the server, and then "renders" it on the client side.
[03:02:36] <peteyboy1> ok, f it, doesn't matter. i'll stick to the basics, react, node, gatsby, jest, react native, TS...

[03:03:06] <wroathe> peteyboy1: But if the user then refreshes the browser window the full catalog page that was just rendered by javascript on the client can be loaded as HTML from the server, and that same loop can start all over again
[03:03:40] <wroathe> peteyboy1: This is sometimes referred to as "progressive enhancement", and making it so that both the server and the client can render the same set of pages is known as "isomorphic" rendering

[03:10:41] <wroathe> peteyboy1: Progressive enhancement requires SSR, to some degree, but the two terms are separate

[03:12:52] <wroathe> peteyboy1: I haven't read this, but it looks like they cover the complete history based on the headings: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web
[03:13:09] <entuland> oversimplifying, progressive enhancement is just having your markup generated on the server and only rely on client side JS to improve the user experience, without breaking your website if JS is off
[03:13:17] <wroathe> peteyboy1: Although they've repurposed SSR to mean something that I've never heard it defined as. I think they're trying to rebrand what everyone calls SSR as "static rendering"
[03:13:27] <peteyboy1> anyway, what screws with my head the most is getting a bunch of theory without seeing it applied in practice, once i get to see in practice it clears things up as i get to associate a term or an explanation with certain code
[03:13:46] <wroathe> peteyboy1: One sec
[03:13:56] <ljharb> not that JS is ever "off", but JS breaks or fails to load *all the time* and your site should fail to "working" in that case.

[03:16:27] <wroathe> The problem with finding an example with Node.JS is that everyone has seemingly moved to doing everything with isomorphic React, which is a good thing for producing web applications, but bad for teaching history

[03:44:09] <entuland> you'll see why server side markup generation is good, for one
[03:44:11] <peteyboy1> like what changes in how i work, after learning that
[03:44:29] <entuland> cause if you do client side generation, your project will simply not work when JS is off

[03:44:49] <peteyboy1> when does it fail?
[03:45:06] <KevinX> in 2010

[03:45:46] <peteyboy1> that escalated quickly
[03:45:52] <wroathe> peteyboy1: There's more to this that entuland isn't touching on. It's important to know the tradeoffs behind the different approaches to building a web application if you want to be put in technical leadership positions.
[03:46:00] <wroathe> peteyboy1: So, like i was saying earlier, it depends on what you want out of life
[03:46:08] <entuland> ^ that
[03:46:14] <entuland> but somewhere you have to start
[03:46:28] <entuland> and getting your hands dirty on that little detail will give you practical insight
[03:46:38] <wroathe> peteyboy1: I think it's important for you to know this, because I consider it to be the best way to build a web application, but in practice how a web application gets built depends on many different kinds of constraints - some of which may not be technical.
[03:46:44] <entuland> so that some question marks turn into exclamation points in your head
[03:47:23] <peteyboy1> i feel like that 12 year old who is told he has to start thinking of what he wants to be when he grows up because high school is near and he has to pick an itinerary
[03:47:40] <wroathe> peteyboy1: For example, I came into a team as a front end "lead" architect on a project where the decision to do client-side rendering had already been made for me over a year before I joined.
[03:47:40] <entuland> you'll get out of that with practice
[03:47:44] <entuland> start coding
[03:48:00] <peteyboy1> what do you mean by start coding?
[03:48:06] <wroathe> peteyboy1: So you just have to live with it until you get an opportunity to lobby for change when the limitations of that become apparent
[03:48:07] <entuland> do stuff, break stuff, see for yourself what works and what doesn't
[03:48:07] <peteyboy1> your exercise?
[03:48:11] <entuland> whatever you want
[03:48:21] <entuland> stop discussing technologies, use them and see for yourself what they can do
[03:48:46] <entuland> until you get a grip, you shouldn't bother discussing them, you need to use them to know about them
[03:48:50] <peteyboy1> i mean, that's what i'm doing. but apparently client side rendering and create react app are not favorable
[03:49:03] <entuland> no, you have misunderstood our points above
[03:49:05] <peteyboy1> ok
[03:49:12] <entuland> you are totally fine using react
[03:49:18] <entuland> if that's what you want to use
[03:49:25] <entuland> just, don't make a normal website with it
[03:49:41] <wroathe> peteyboy1: "not favorable" isn't quite correct. There's lots of history and considerations to unpack here.
[03:49:51] <wroathe> peteyboy1: I would avoid coming to any conclusions based on this one conversation alone, if I were you
[03:50:03] <peteyboy1> like a static one with 3 pages? i wouldn't, i would use gatsby, wordpress or something
[03:50:11] <entuland> good
[03:50:35] <entuland> but you need to do them even as toy projects of a couple of hours to get a grip and know the differences
[03:50:48] <peteyboy1> wroathe, hahah, thanks for bringing me closer to no conclusion :D
[03:50:51] <wroathe> peteyboy1: If you you're coming on to a team where you've only got a limited amount of time to shop something, and none of your teammates are familiar with server-side development, then create-react-app is a perfectly reasonable way to get something going
[03:51:01] <wroathe> time to ship something*
[03:51:04] <wroathe> Words are hard
[03:51:39] <peteyboy1> entuland, talking about static websites? of course, gatsby is near the top of the list of the things i want to delve into
[03:51:44] <wroathe> peteyboy1: And if there are limitations for what kind of infrastructure you can get set up in production then create-react-app/client side rendering may also be perfectly reasonable
[03:52:00] <entuland> no, actually I wasn't talking about a static website in my exercise
[03:52:01] <wroathe> peteyboy1: I'm just telling you how I would do things if I had full control and there were no constraints I had to work under that prevent me from doing things how I want.
[03:52:26] <entuland> that was meant to be a stub of a dynamic website with server side templating and added user experience with AJAX
[03:52:48] <entuland> which, for the purpose of "getting a grip", you should be coding from scratch without using any library whatsoever
[03:53:01] <peteyboy1> entuland, no no, i was referring "to a normal website"
[03:53:30] <entuland> yes, normal websites nowadays around are built like that, dynamic with optional JS improvement

[03:59:17] <wroathe> peteyboy1: In an office context it's important to be able to make decisions that impact how the people around you will be working, and to articulate why you think those are the right decisions (in a leadership position)
[03:59:59] <wroathe> If your goal in life is just to show up and sling some React for an hourly rate then you probably don't need to know the complete history of web application development
[04:00:12] <wroathe> So, like I was saying, it depends on what you want out of life
[04:00:42] <peteyboy1> ok, yes. but i think you assume because i'm in this chat that i have such ambitions, or ambitions of your level. i really don't. i'm not saying i just want to do the minimum possible, because it's not true, but i also don't want to have 20 people working under me in microsoft
[04:01:21] <wroathe> peteyboy1: I wasn't making any assumptions. I was just trying to answer your broad questions :P
[04:01:37] <peteyboy1> ok, but i didn't know they were broad :)
[04:01:57] <peteyboy1> it's a bit like when a clueless recruiter asks me "so how would you rate your javascript?"
[04:02:13] <entuland> yeah, that's a bad question to me
[04:02:16] <wroathe> The answer to that is "fucking amazing"
[04:02:28] <wroathe> "But how would YOU rate my javascript?"
[04:02:32] <peteyboy1> and i get stuck a few seconds with the entire macrocosmos in my head because i probably don't even know how much javascript there is out there that i don't know, and where the ultimate knowledge ends
[04:02:53] <GreenJello> peteyboy1, respond with another question: "how long after writing it?
[04:02:56] <entuland> don't seek that ultimate knowledge if you want to get stuff done
[04:03:00] <wroathe> GreenJello: ha
[04:03:04] <peteyboy1> it's a bit like that here, i made a question, but i had no idea whether it was something super deep and broad or the most common topic in any office working with react
[04:04:03] <entuland> well I guess now you got a better picture of what's a generic, broad question and what could be something more specific and down-to-earth of an actual project at hand?
[04:04:29] <peteyboy1> entuland, and i'm not, i want to be as knowledgeable as possible, but without making huge tradeoffs elsewhere. i'm not gonna be mastering everything-SSR if there is a client waiting for his shit to get done lol
[04:04:53] <entuland> good, if you need to get stuff done with react and client side rendering, so be it
[04:05:07] <entuland> if you have spare time and you want to increase your knowledge, check on the other approaches
[04:05:08] <peteyboy1> i think i did, point taken - "only ask questions related to your current project" :P
[04:05:29] <peteyboy1> sounds good, i'm glad we found a common language haha
[04:05:44] <entuland> it's not that you can't ask generic, broad questions, it's just that they're not as useful as they look
[04:05:53] <peteyboy1> entuland, i don't know that either
[04:05:59] <wroathe> peteyboy1: Think of conversations like as "mental squats"
[04:06:07] <peteyboy1> just like an 8 year old asking his parents what an orgasm is
[04:06:12] <wroathe> like this*
[04:06:35] <wroathe> peteyboy1: That's making me think of this movie I watched recently, Captain Fantastic. Highly recommend.
[04:06:41] <peteyboy1> wroathe, my quads are wasted already from this conversation

[04:11:13] <entuland> I'd focus on shorter, smaller goals to get a feeling if you _truly_ enjoy what you do, so that you can decide
[04:11:35] <entuland> you can earn much more than that with the scenario you depicted
[04:11:36] <peteyboy1> entuland, i'm beyond that. i do enjoy it, especially in comparison to 99% of professions nowadays

[04:12:50] <peteyboy1> entuland, i have never done it for work, and i'm sure it's like that. but one has to at least partially prepare you for the other
[04:12:57] <peteyboy1> no

[04:23:22] *** slaughter is now known as slaughtr
[04:23:52] <entuland> but if you know enough JS on the server side to template some HTML, read a file, reply to a URL request, and you know how to implement AJAX in vanilla JS, you should be able to do all of what I described from scratch
[04:24:18] <entuland> you don't even need to read a file if you put your dummy article text in two JS variables in your code
[04:24:47] <entuland> it really was just to get a feeling of how the vast majority of the web is built, with a very small practical exercise
[04:25:16] <peteyboy1> entuland, pretty much the only thing i've ever used js for on the server side is to build routes/endpoints
[04:25:26] <entuland> that's one bit of it, yes
[04:26:07] <entuland> create two endpoints /article1 and /article2, serve those two pages and build on from there until you've achieved what I described, and you'll have the basic mechanism done to get that "feeling"
[04:27:17] <entuland> a lot of what you'd need to study to complete the exercise would come in handy anyways with any react you'd be using anyways, cause you'll be dealing with templating somewhere, HTML somewhere else, AJAX in some other bit and CSS to put bells and whistles on top of it

[04:31:28] <peteyboy1> well, in the context that you, wroathe and ljharb say better
[04:32:00] <entuland> if you got the gist of it, you already know it's better, for the simple fact that a JS failure wouldn't break it by design
[04:32:45] <entuland> the exercise is just an excuse to get your hands on coding and continue your studies with the only sane way - putting in practice whatever you're studying
[04:33:38] *** Joins: leduyquang753 (~leduyquan@user/leduyquang753)
[04:33:44] <entuland> with "JS failure" of course I mean _client side_ JS failure
[04:33:53] <peteyboy1> of course
[04:34:24] <entuland> just making it clear cause JS isn't widely used on the server side but that's the one you know right now
[04:34:42] <entuland> a lot of the web out there runs on PHP on the server side
[04:35:02] <entuland> and chances are sometimes you'll have to deal with it as well
[04:36:00] <peteyboy1> ok, was about to ask what you meant with 'isn't widely used'. sure, in relative terms looking at the entire internet, sure, but job vacancies say otherwise i believe
[04:36:57] <entuland> that I can't tell, I've been a fullstack developer for a long time (PHP + HTML + CSS + JS) and I've now kinda "retired" from that, I do support for a game right now, so I don't know how the market is going about it
[04:37:06] <wroathe> peteyboy1: The possibility that JS might not be available isn't really the best reason to practice this. I wish entuland would stop bringing it up :P

[04:38:28] <entuland> another reason why I like the server side generation of the markup is just not to have my templating code half on the server and half on the client, but that's personal taste
[04:39:43] *** Joins: sickdyd (~sickd@120.51.82.69.ap.gmobb-fix.jp)
[04:41:39] <wroathe> peteyboy1: The reasons to practice progressive enhancement that I can think of are: 1. Mastery of what browsers natively support through HTML that don't require you to write Javascript, 2. Greater accessibility because of the knowledge it builds around semantic HTML, 3. HTTP caching and server caching for pages rendered on the server, 4. Clearly understood separations of concern between what can be
[04:41:45] <wroathe> done natively by the browser and what requires Javascript, 5. Greater interactivity and responsiveness for applications that get their initial page from the server, and 6. Nontrivial global energy savings from not having CPUs constantly rebinding data to templates (if done right)
[04:42:12] <wroathe> Oh, and I should include what can be done natively by CSS too
[04:43:22] <wroathe> I shared an example in here yesterday about what some of my former coworkers were doing to navigate around in their client-side only rendered app, and that's an example where the people writing that code were completely unaware of how applications got built before Javascript. By mixing that prior knowledge and just a little bit of Javascript the outcome is infinitely more semantic and infinitely better
[04:43:54] <entuland> just for the records, I agree on all on that, I just tend to try and get smaller bits across, which can be used to build on once one has got the feeling of them
[04:45:22] <wroathe> I once saw someone asking how to go about getting a form to POST data to the server and redirect. Felt like I was living in a weird fantasy land.
[04:45:40] <wroathe> They were asking how to do it in JS

In the last couple of
[05:26:32] <wroathe> years the React team started consoldating their build recommendations into this create-react-app project, and I personally have a very hard time relinquishing control to that.

[05:38:16] <wroathe> peteyboy1: If you're interested in build systems, then learn about build systems. This is another one of those cases where you need to figure out your needs and goals.
[05:39:09] <wroathe> peteyboy1: Here. I'll share a lazy example from this current sample app I'm working on, that doesn't quite do everything I would want it to do if I were working on a much larger project with a team.

[05:41:44] <wroathe> peteyboy1: I spent maybe 10 minutes in total configuring all of this, and not overthinking it too much. For a much larger project this would potentially handle multiple entry points, and combine common chunks into vendor bundles and things like that
[05:43:23] <wroathe> Oh, also outputting resources with hashes in their names for cache busting is another feature I would add

[05:45:27] <wroathe> And configuring the server for hot module reloading
[05:45:39] <wroathe> Point is, there's lots, and I would want to personally manage all of that as the project grows.

[17:27:15] <Lope> entuland, thanks man. Even if I just paste the scales section of this sample in, and add in stuff like lineWidth: 5 etc, it has no effect

[17:27:51] <entuland> got that much, but it would be faster if you could provide the fiddle for us to see and check / alter
[17:28:19] <Lope> entuland, thanks bud, might take me a long time to get a fiddle going, but okay, cos I'm stumped. Will make a fiddle.
[17:28:50] <entuland> yep, point is it would likely take any of us longer to set it up to try and help you
[17:29:34] <Lope> okay, I was just hoping someone is familiar with the new charts.js and is aware of some gotcha hehe. But for sure, I understand what you're saying. Will make a fiddle.

[18:03:57] <Lope> I see some stuff where they set the background color with the data, but that doesn't make any sense.

[18:04:45] <Lope> Oh, I was skim reading and was only looking at the code but now read it properly "you would want a background image or color over the whole canvas. There is no built-in support for this"
[18:05:26] <MJCD> Lope: I believe for chart.js what you do is just set the background to transparent
[18:05:35] <MJCD> and then put whatever you want under it

[18:07:43] <Lope> it's not just CSS

[18:42:43] <OhTheCode> https://jsfiddle.net/tcaz7ky2/
[18:42:55] <OhTheCode> probably to do with a promise inside of a promise
[18:44:05] <Lope> MJCD, oh, you're saying the background is a DATA element?
[18:44:24] <Lope> Cos I was scratching my head there when you said that, cos it's all rendered in a canvas.
[18:44:51] <entuland> isn't the background pluging shown in the page I linked not working?
[18:45:00] <jaawerth> OhTheCode: it's because the `new Promise` in cl2 does'nt invoke `resolve`, so the promise is left pending forever
[18:45:02] <MJCD> I literally showed you a full fiddle lol
[18:45:12] <MJCD> if you're having issues, make your own fiddle
[18:45:20] <MJCD> and post that
[18:45:58] <jaawerth> OhTheCode: you generally don't ever need to use `new Promise` unless you're wrapping something callback-based, basically. particularly in an `async` function which will already wrap any return values or thrown errors in a Promise for you
[18:46:00] <Lope> MJCD ah, looking at the fiddle again, I don't see anything special going on, backgroundColor "just works (tm)"

[18:46:42] <MJCD> snek: oh no
[18:46:44] <Lope> MJCD, the reason I wondered if it was an element, is if you look here, there's a backgroundColor property given with the data. https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/
[18:46:47] <jaawerth> I don't disagree but every other alternative has something I also don't like about it

[19:26:44] <jaawerth> well, it's a relatively new FF feature and it would be perfectly reasonable for someone to miss it while still being very knowledgeable
[19:27:12] <onosendi> jaawerth: correct. If you're just using FF's containers, everything you open outside of the containers is able to track you, since the cookies aren't getting removed. Temp containers opens a new containre for each domain, or depending on how you have it configured. So basically, Multi-Account containers allows you to persist logins for what you want, and everything else gets opened in a temp
[19:27:13] <jaawerth> so sorry if I offended you but that wasn't the intent

[19:31:01] <MJCD> you can just send a timestamp from the front end

[19:35:49] <MJCD> and feed that variable into that query instead
[19:35:59] <jaawerth> personally I would just set it as a default value for createdAt in the table so you don't have to manually include it in the insert

[19:37:30] <MJCD> they're literally generating the time on the server and then saying that's the issue they're having haha
[19:37:35] <MJCD> afaik
[19:38:14] <jaawerth> MJCD: I don't think that's correct, that hte issue is that it's server time, the UTC part is just being lost in translation from what I can see. for a createdAt field, you would generally want it to be generated server-side anyway

[19:41:28] <wroathe> Yeah, your database server should support something like sqlite's DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
[19:41:39] <wroathe> No need to send it from your application server
[19:43:29] <jaawerth> yeah in postgres you can just do `DEFAULT now()` when creating the table schema
[19:43:48] <jaawerth> or onosendi could do `ALTER TABLE user ALTER COLUMN "createdAt" SET DEFAULT now();`
[19:43:48] <onosendi> I think `table.datetime('createdAt').defaultTo(knex.fn.now());` is what you guys are suggesting.
[19:44:02] <jaawerth> knex.fn.now() would be a good way to manually do it
[19:44:19] <jaawerth> but for a createdAt field, shouldn't it populate that regardless of whether the client doing the insert includes it?

[21:11:07] <entuland> if that article is accurate, and the graphs are as well, it's the app that gets the auth from the client side and dispatches it to the APP to prove they've been auth'd
[21:11:26] <entuland> but I ignore the technical details and the actual implementation, just trying to help find pointers
[21:11:29] <ljharb> the browser's security model requires that the *serving webserver* handle initial auth

[21:18:50] <entuland> that's the insecure flow, but that's not the point - when you use that kind of auth you have to do the login somewhere, and that somewhere should be the browser, as far as I could understand
[21:19:40] <GreenJello> jaawerth, if you don't accept classic form posts it can be an afterthought
[21:20:10] <jaawerth> true, it's less of an issue if there isn't any kind of session usage and it's all tokens
[21:20:16] <merpnderp> entuland: So this is an example of a mobile user, who's app has opened the browser to do the PKCE flow?
[21:20:32] <jaawerth> but then you have to wonder what kind of tokens, and that comes down to the auth flow, which is harder than it should be to do right
[21:20:50] <jaawerth> or you have people using jwt and we all know the security isseus those can cause
[21:20:52] <GreenJello> even with sessions, you can do something as simple as a custom header with a fixed value, or even simpler if you reject urlencoded/multipart posts

[21:23:48] <wroathe> merpnderp: In the diagram Auth0 Tenant is the OIDC server

[21:24:41] <wroathe> merpnderp: In the diagram "App" is the client

[21:25:54] <entuland> unless I misunderstood the original question

[21:26:07] <wroathe> in Oauth/OIDC parlance
[21:26:25] <wroathe> And whether or not it talks to the auth server is a function of how you do  your authorization with the access token
[21:26:50] *** Quits: jonifen (~jonifen@user/jonifen) (Quit: Leaving)
[21:26:56] <wroathe> Some advocate for stateless bearer tokens where they completely trust the data contained within the token, and in other cases some advocate phoning back to the auth server and asking if the token is valid or not
[21:27:04] <wroathe> (which can be a little performance intensive at scale)
[21:27:37] <entuland> checking in with the auth server from the server that is actually serving the important data looks like the safest approach indeed
[21:28:11] <entuland> but does that mean that the access token could be forged and trick the API into thinking it's valid even though it's not?
[21:28:11] <wroathe> This is typically handled by phoning back to the auth server and hitting the "token introspection" endpoint: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662
[21:28:50] <wroathe> entuland: In the stateless token case, potentially.
[21:28:58] <entuland> I see
[21:29:25] <wroathe> There are some details related to signing a bearer token that I'm not up to speed on that prevent that in theory
[21:29:34] <wroathe> You'll have to hit the specs
[21:29:40] *** Joins: Lope (~lope@user/lope)
[21:30:06] <doc> I've written some jwt stuff. The gist is the token data is signed with your own key, so can't be manipulated
[21:30:12] <wroathe> merpnderp: Moral of the story: hit the specs, and then hit the auth0 documentation

[21:34:07] *** Joins: Rockwood (~Rocky@117.97.226.119)
[21:35:23] <wroathe> The massive security problem with stateless bearer tokens beyond potential tampering is that there's no way to revoke them. Once they're out in the wild they stay active for as long as specified in the token, and there's no way to verify that the user the token was intended for is the one actually using it
[21:35:23] *** Quits: straykitten (~straykitt@subs24-116-206-8-43.three.co.id) (Quit: Leaving)
[21:36:05] <doc> which is why short expiration times are useful, with refresh tokens
[21:36:08] <wroathe> Once you implement a mechanism for keeping track of revoked tokens you're introducing state to the equation, which is more secure, but also requires database lookups for authorization
[21:36:13] <wroathe> Yup, exactly
[21:36:18] *** Quits: dodobrain_ (~dodobrain@user/dodobrain) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[21:37:07] <doc> speaking of which, have any of you actually written anything that involved auth revocation? I haven't :)
[21:37:40] <wroathe> I haven't, but that doesn't mean it's not required in some high security circumstances
[21:37:51] <wroathe> Solutions must fit the problem, after all
[21:38:14] <wroathe> At some point you start thinking about not using bearer tokens at all, and just go back to using sessions
[21:38:44] <jaawerth> that's still my preference when I can get away with it
[21:39:08] <Rockwood> lol
[21:39:21] <jaawerth> sessions are tried and true
[21:39:30] <Rockwood> lots of crazy like me on earth :D
[21:39:34] <wroathe> I'm told that in some high scale environments database lookups for authorization aren't an option, but I'm skeptical of that
[21:39:45] <Rockwood> like alcohol :D
[21:40:07] <wroathe> That's second hand speculation I've heard from people thinking about things like AWS, Google, or Facebook
[21:40:07] <jaawerth> yeah certain federation usecases make them less workable

[23:22:56] <teut>             <button class="btn btn-dark"  formaction="/general?page=1">&laquo; first</button>    is here anything wrong   , with  the syntax of this  ` formaction `?
[23:23:35] *** Quits: dodobrain_ (~dodobrain@user/dodobrain) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[23:24:26] <ThePendulum> I read that as a single word. the URL implies it's retrieving something so I'm not sure if a button is the most suitable. don't think I've seen this before, normally it's put in a form
[23:24:41] <ThePendulum> don't think there's anything wrong with the syntax per se
[23:25:11] <teut> when I wrote like this   ` formaction="?page=1"  `  I got the initial part too
[23:25:48] <teut> but with that  `/general`  appended the initial part is not added
[23:26:32] <alystair> probably a better question for #html, however https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#htmlattrdefformaction may help you

[23:26:50] <teut> maybe then not a web problem  but django's
[23:27:02] <merpnderp> wroathe: So that auth0 PKCE could all be done from the webapi?
[23:27:24] <merpnderp> I'd just need to pass back the redirect from the webapi back to the SPA
[23:28:01] <merpnderp> Because my webapi is not the resource server.
[23:28:21] <merpnderp> I have to use another team's PKCE implementation and their resource server does nothing but return the email.
[23:28:34] <merpnderp> So I need a sercure way to get the user's email.
[23:28:41] <merpnderp> And if it just comes from the SPA, I can't trust it.
[23:29:08] <alystair> what channel should I visit to discuss http headers?
[23:30:12] <alystair> maybe it's more of a mailing list thing...
[23:30:29] <jaawerth> it may depend on the header in question or what kind of discussion you hvae in mind, but either here or a channel for whatever server tech you're using is probably as good as any other
[23:30:42] <jaawerth> if you're talking http spec stuff that's probably mailing list though haha

[23:42:56] <Toninho> Hi all. Can you tell me why this script runs if there is no explicit call to run? http://paste.debian.net/1201557/
[23:43:58] <GreenJello> Toninho, each isn't a function
[23:44:15] *** Quits: zacts (~zak@user/zacts) (Quit: gtg)
[23:45:16] <Toninho> GreenJello: ok.. even then, I don't call init, so why the script runs?
[23:46:56] <Toninho> I am testing with node not in a browser, in any case it shouldn't print anything at all, while it prints..
[23:47:20] <Toninho> I just wish to understand why :)
[23:47:49] <GreenJello> init just throws if you call it
[23:48:06] <GreenJello> I don't know why you have the expectation that it's relevant
[23:48:20] <GreenJello> forEach iterates over an array when you call forEach
[23:48:46] <GreenJello> you're calling it before you even define 'init'
[23:49:18] <wroathe> merpnderp: No, the PKCE thing is done when you're exchanging an authorization code with the auth server to get an access token
[23:49:39] <wroathe> merpnderp: The API is typically the "resource server", which is the thing that needs an access token to access
[23:49:46] <merpnderp> wroathe: so my webapi would use the access token to query the resource server for their email?
[23:50:10] <jaawerth> alystair: yeah that's a good question.. also based on that, moz may have "deprecated" it out of their recommendations due to compat andbecause it hasn't landed in an RFC yet, and it not making it into an RFC could be for a number of reasons, including "nobody has taken ownership to complete it"
[23:50:15] <wroathe> merpnderp: I really don't know what you're trying to do. I'm just giving you the generic top-down view of the auth flow with OIDC
[23:50:16] <realies> GreenJello, I think the issue from yesterday is, that the redirect from one place to another (302) sets Origin to null when using XMLHttpRequest
[23:50:21] <wroathe> merpnderp: You'll have to explain what your goals are
[23:51:26] <merpnderp> wroathe: Okay, we have an application that's an SPA with its own webapi. We've been tasked with using another groups openid connect server for authentication. But their resource server only returns emails and f/l names.
[23:51:41] <merpnderp> So my webapi will need the email to do things to their account.
[23:51:53] <merpnderp> But it can't get it from the SPA, because that isn't secure at all.
[23:51:55] <GreenJello> realies, oh, interesting
[23:51:56] <Toninho> GreenJello: for sure, but the point is: if I associate forEach to a variable, the function of forEach only will run, if I call the variable that points to the function. In that case, the script doesn't call any variable that have a builtin function. Therefor, it shouldn't print anything right?
[23:52:08] <merpnderp> But the SPA could return a valid access token, so that the webapi could query the resource server.
[23:52:23] <realies> GreenJello, I found this, not sure if there's any way around it though, https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#ref-for-concept-request-tainted-origin%E2%91%A0
[23:52:26] <GreenJello> Toninho, no, that isn't a thing
[23:52:42] <GreenJello> Toninho, the each variable doesn't do anything here
[23:52:43] <wroathe> merpnderp: Can you wait for a few minutes for me to finish lunch, and then I'll read this and get back to you?
[23:52:58] <GreenJello> Toninho, it's just array.forEach(…); const each = undefined
[23:53:05] <merpnderp> wroathe: Absolutely
[23:53:13] *** Joins: dunkeln (~dunkeln@94.129.65.28)
[23:55:59] <Toninho> GreenJello: please, copy that script to a file and run it in nodejs if possible. I run that and I get the result of "each" without calling "each" -  ( everything is defined and when gets infinity it stops ) ..
[23:56:11] <GreenJello> Toninho, that's expected
[23:56:21] <GreenJello> each is not a function
[23:56:40] *** Quits: mickey (~user@user/mickey) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[23:57:31] <Toninho> :( not the point.. each is defined by me as a function. So "each" is a function is that script
[23:57:41] <GreenJello> no
[23:58:04] <GreenJello> you could make it a function if you want
[23:58:06] <Toninho> so I am lost.. I don't understand.. sorry my bad
[23:58:07] <jaawerth> Toninho: to expand on GreenJello's point, for each is currently assigned the results of numsm.forEach(...), which means that is invoked right away and each is assigned undefined. that is why it runs immediately, becausei t's not wrapped in a function
[23:58:24] <jaawerth> as opposed to `const each = () => nums.forEach(....)`
[23:58:52] <Toninho> hmm
