[12:04:11] <JDemel[m]> luisherasme: I assume you want to "normalize" your constellation. i.e. $E(|x|^2) =1$. Most communication standards use such a normalized set of constellations. However, all standards I can think of assume that all symbols are equiprobable. In general, you need to know the probability of your symbols and compute a mean. That's just the usual stuff you learned in probability theory/statistics.

[15:20:36] <amlangford[m]> Hi. Looking for some help with some embedded python I added to my flowgraph to write the values the from the snr estimator messages to file. Im using msg_file_sink.py from https://github.com/marcusmueller/gr-msgtools/tree/master/python ...... this is working for me, provided the flowgraph doesnt contain "certain" blocks ! I have a simple test flowgraph with a signal src > const modulator > throttle > mpsk snr estimator > my custom block
[15:20:36] <amlangford[m]> with the msk_file_sink.py ... this creates a binary file containing the snr values as float64. However, if I simply add a QT Gui Entry block to the flowgraph and re-run, the output file remains empty, as if something is blocking the embedded python from being able to write the messages to file. I have no idea how to solve this. Any suggestions greatly appreciated!

[15:34:16] <amlangford[m]> with the QT gui entry block disabled, the file output.dat from msg_file_sink contains the SNR values I need. If I simply enable the qt gui entry block, output.dat remains empty. I need to understand what is causing the embedded python block from failing to write data when the flowgraph contains certain blocks so that I can get this working in my receiver.

[15:49:02] <willcode4[m]> Did the Message Debug still work?
[15:50:14] <amlangford[m]> yes, the message debug continues to output the snr values from the estimator to the console , but the output file remains empty ... I just need those numbers in a file. 
[15:50:34] <willcode4[m]> Doesn't make sense. Do you have any more info?
[15:52:05] <DerekKozel[m]> Are you trying to use the GUI Entry to change the filename?
[15:57:41] <amlangford[m]> No, it makes no sense at all. Im not using the gui entry to do anything at all, infact, I dont even need it in the flowgraph. But I have found that it's a trigger for the failed write to file. Ive got a simple bpsk demod that I need a log of the snr values writing to file. My custom python block is misbehaving there too. If I can figure out why the qt gui entry is causing problems, hopefully I can get it working for my demod flowgraph
[15:59:02] <willcode4[m]> Post a GRC and what GR version you are using and I'll give it a try.

[16:14:13] <amlangford[m]> Very weird! It definitely works for me if I disable the gui entry box. Works every time. So frustrating. Do you even get the output.dat?
[16:14:51] <willcode4[m]> The message handler is not being called. This is w/o the Entry block.
[16:17:26] <willcode4[m]> Add a `_file.flush()` after the write and see if it changes anything for you.
[16:19:01] <willcode4[m]> It does seem to work more often if you run the .py outside of GRC. See if that makes a difference for you.
[16:20:37] <amlangford[m]> Interesting. I added self._file.flush() after the file write in the msg_handler both with and w/o the entry block enabled! 
[16:21:45] <willcode4[m]> OK, so it's not strictly the Qt block that changing things. It's some effect of having a low rate output and file i/o buffering. Things may be set up differently when running under GRC or as a Qt app.
[16:23:08] <willcode4[m]> You might also try overriding stop() and closing the file there.
[16:23:42] <willcode4[m]> I'll assume you'll figure it out and report back what things worked.

[16:26:24] <amlangford[m]> Just tried it in the demod chain that I need to collect the data from, using your suggestion of adding _file.flush() ... its working there too now! Thank you! 
[16:29:23] <amlangford[m]> <willcode4[m]> "You might also try overriding..." <- could you elaborate on "over riding stop()" ... how exactly would I do that? Where is the file currently being closed from? The __init__ opens it, the handler writes to it ... but who closes it? 
[16:31:57] <willcode4[m]> Linux is closing it abruptly when the app is killed. See my recents posts on the mailing list that show an example of  overriding start() and stop().

[18:13:05] <jsallay[m]> I have some code where I start a flowgraph and then do some other processing while it runs. Is there a way for me to check if the flowgraph is still running? The wait function blocks, which is not what I'm looking for.

[18:23:46] <willcode4[m]> See if calling `finished()` on one of the blocks works.
[18:27:28] <willcode4[m]> That may work only on blocks that are message-only. Hard to tell from the code.
[18:28:29] <willcode4[m]> It may work on the top block.
[18:29:27] <jsallay[m]> The block I'm looking at doesn't have a finished function, not the top block.  However, I do know how much data to process so I can just monitor nitems_written

[20:56:03] <blue94[m]> Did you try to record and replay your garage remote?
[20:56:12] <blue94[m]> Because I seem to replay it but my garage doesnt open
[20:56:16] <blue94[m]> 🤷
[20:56:26] <willcode4[m]> Doesn't work with modern ones.
[20:56:32] <Yamakaja[m]> Those systems usually have replay protection
[20:56:43] <blue94[m]> Yamakaja[m]: yeah I thought its that
[20:56:58] <blue94[m]> so the system is talking back to remote or something
[20:57:07] <Yamakaja[m]> Try recording a transmission that is not in range of your garage and then immediately replying that 
[20:57:45] <Yamakaja[m]> No, it just transmits a counter or something derived from a counter that the receiver keeps track of
[20:59:19] <blue94[m]> Yamakaja[m]: hmm but I have several remotes
[20:59:41] <Yamakaja[m]> It might have multiple counters?
[20:59:46] <blue94[m]> my wife lost hers and since i've been playing with this Im not gonna pay the full price to some random technician
[20:59:47] <blue94[m]> ^^
[21:00:54] <blue94[m]> Yamakaja[m]: oh, could be like that
[21:01:07] <blue94[m]> Since it has maximum limit of remotes

[22:04:44] <Yamakaja[m]> (I mean it should be safe & secure, obviously 😂)
[22:05:07] <blue94[m]> I vaguely remember having it repaired sometime recently, perhaps they changed the rf doodad to the new one. 
[22:08:37] <blue94[m]> now that I am rf master perhaps I should replace it with some relay and arduino junk so it will open when I pull around the corner with my car 😎
