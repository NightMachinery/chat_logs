[18:23:49] <AllenJB> paule32: See example #3: https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php
[18:23:51] <paule32> yes
[18:24:07] <no_gravity> paule32: Because you said "mit" :)
[18:24:25] <paule32> oh sorrx
[18:24:28] <paule32> y
[18:24:29] <paule32> :)
[18:25:45] <paule32> AllenJB: i would say the example #3 is it
[18:26:03] <paule32> but it did not work for my case
[18:26:05] <AllenJB> Polymorphism: Can you pastebin the generated HTML source (Ctrl+U in the browser)
[18:29:52] <paule32> https://dpaste.com/GTQX95WFK
[18:31:57] <no_gravity> paule32: What is the code that caused this notice?
[18:33:29] <paule32> a callable function: public function onDblClick  (callable $fc): bool { $fc(); return true;
[18:33:47] <AllenJB> paule32: Where's the use?
[18:35:10] <paule32> $my_app1 -> Event -> onDblClick(function() {
[18:35:14] <paule32> see paste
[18:35:58] <AllenJB> paule32: I mean the 'use ($my_app1)' you should have if you've implemented what I pointed you to

[18:44:51] <no_gravity> I wonder if PHP performance could be improved by not compiling dead code like the 'if' in the loop here: https://3v4l.org/2KEU6/vld
[18:45:28] <no_gravity> They way it does it now, it does a million comprisons for nothing.
[18:45:44] <AllenJB> Polymorphism: You've got some PHP code in your CSS (also missing parameters to those functions). But I cannot see the "} }" that you said you were seeing on the page
[18:46:23] <Naktibalda> no_gravity: how about using static analysis and removing it instead?
[18:47:01] <no_gravity> Naktibalda: How do you mean? I am not much into compilers etc. So maybe I am missing some of the terminology.
[18:47:23] <Naktibalda> I mean that you can find dead code using some tools or manually and delete it
[18:47:43] <Naktibalda> keeping dead code is a bad practice anyway
[18:48:13] <Naktibalda> your proposed change wouldn't make good code any faster.
[18:48:18] <no_gravity> Naktibalda: Well, the constant typically is something like DEBUG so you can easily switch to a run with debug output etc.
[18:48:45] <no_gravity> Naktibalda: Or other compile time settings. It is a totally normal practice in many languages.

[18:50:25] <no_gravity> Naktibalda: Search for "ifdef" in the Linux codebase for example. Over ten thousand hits.
[18:51:13] <no_gravity> https://github.com/torvalds/linux/search?q=ifdef
[18:51:48] <Naktibalda> you can probably use of assert() for optimising your debug code
[18:52:04] <no_gravity> Naktibalda: How so?
[18:53:01] <AllenJB> It's possible certain optimizations don't show up in opcodes, especially if JIT is enabled. You might be better off asking on the internals maiiling list or the ChatOverflow PHP room
[18:53:43] <no_gravity> AllenJB: That might be. Would be cool to have an insight into what the JIT creates.
[18:54:43] <AllenJB> From what I've heard, I believe there's maybe 2 people in the whole world who might be able to figure that out =P

[18:59:22] <__adrian> or for your usage, you might even want onDblClick() to rebind the anon function, and then you'd simply use $this
