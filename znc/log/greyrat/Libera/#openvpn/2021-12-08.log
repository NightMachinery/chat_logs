[19:10:36] <clarkk> I've moved to a new local network where the default gateway is 192.168.1.1 rather than 192.168.1.254, however, when I connect to my openvpn endpoint, the route '<openvpn ip address> via 192.168.1.254 dev wlp2s0' is added, even though it should be 192.168.1.1.  I can't find where it's adding this address. Does anyone know, please?
[19:10:38] *** Joins: mete (~mete@static.201.165.216.95.clients.your-server.de)
[19:20:49] <rob0> 192.168.1.x is a very bad choice when you want to use VPNs
[19:26:09] <clarkk> unfortunately I have no control over it
[19:27:35] <clarkk> it worked absolutely fine for over a year anyway.  I just don't understand where it's adding 192.168.1.254 as the external route to the openvpn endpoint
[19:29:36] <rob0> wlp2s0 is a wireless interface, no?
[19:30:02] <clarkk> correct
[19:30:38] <clarkk> sorry, I forgot to say, this is happening on an Ubuntu 20.04 system
[19:32:21] <rob0> why do you think openvpn is adding this route?
[19:34:17] <clarkk> I guess so I can contact other services running on the endpoint via its public address?
[19:35:32] <rob0> where was the pastebin of the server configuration?
[19:39:23] <clarkk> rob0, http://paste.debian.net/hidden/062b93d4/
[19:45:31] <clarkk> I have always started the connection via the shell.  Now, when I CTRL+C the connection, as I always have done, it does not delete the added route

[20:01:59] <benbrown> I contribute to a python service that mirrors source in the various formats it may be distributed in, in this instance I'm trying to mirror the source tarball from swupdate.openvpn.org, which fails with a 403, I believe since it uses the default urllib user-agent of 'Python-urllib/3.x'.

[20:06:41] <maxhawaii> hi! I'm trying to set up an OpenVPN server on a teltonika rutx14 4g modem/router... however, whenever the openvpn server starts, all local clients connected via LAN can no longer communicate with the router
[20:06:55] <maxhawaii> i think something is wrong with my routing
[20:07:10] <maxhawaii> my lan network is 192.168.1.0/24
[20:08:14] <maxhawaii> and the virtual network is on 10.8.0.0/24
[20:09:09] <plaisthos> benbrown: are you sure that you got the url right?
[20:10:02] <plaisthos> maxhawaii: what is your server ocnfig?
[20:10:48] <maxhawaii> plaisthos, it has been configured using the teltonika ui, so unfortunately i don't have a standard .ovpn file
[20:11:38] <maxhawaii> 2 sec, i think i might be able to produce a ovpn file actually
[20:11:45] <benbrown> plaisthos: Yup, same url works with `request.add_header("User-Agent", "Mozilla")` but not without

[20:17:43] <maxhawaii> ugh, i started the openvpn server (to get teltonika to produce an .ovpn file), and now i cannot access the device - not even through vpn, which i could before
[20:18:31] <maxhawaii> i'm rebooting it, and then i'll try again - otherwise i have to do a factory-reset (again)
[20:18:42] <maxhawaii> but the gist of it was something like this:
[20:19:17] <maxhawaii> server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0, udp, dev tun, client_config_dir /blabla/

[20:20:24] <maxhawaii> whoops, the last should be push "route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0"
[20:21:00] <maxhawaii> it seems that it is the iroute 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 which breaks my device
[20:21:31] <maxhawaii> what am I missing?
[20:21:57] <maxhawaii> i can (or at least, could) connect via vpn and access the device at 10.8.0.1
[20:22:07] <maxhawaii> but not at 192.168.1.0
[20:22:58] <maxhawaii> it seems like the 192.168.0.0 subnet is completely inaccessible
