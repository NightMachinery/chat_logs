[02:50:20] <int-e> If this is a real world key you're likely out of luck; if it's from a CTF challenge or similar, there are a few classes of numbers that are easy to factor... which is a fun topic to research.
[02:54:49] <gproto23> i do not know much about cryptography. just i am here to learn. it is rsa256. i have no idea how can i find private key
[02:56:23] <iz> if it's a ctf, it's probably a weak number that can be factored using some trick.. start w/ that number and then start googling about factoring tricks

[03:34:25] <wasamasa> yeah
[03:34:33] <wasamasa> seems to be based on wishful thinking so far
[03:34:45] <wasamasa> nothing about it looks like a challenge designed to be solved and teach you something
[03:35:41] <TimMc> I think they're trying to get a bug bounty and thought maybe the presence of this key indicated a vulnerability.
[03:35:52] <gproto23> it's a given target from ctf. what makes impossible to find private key i do not get it
[03:36:01] <wasamasa> link to the ctf, lol

[03:41:01] <wasamasa> doesn't seem to be advertised at all
[03:42:12] <Wulf> gproto23: you're missing something. And with so very few details we cannot help you at all.
[03:42:43] <wasamasa> yeah, in CTFs you typically have a name, description, other information, ...
[03:43:10] <wasamasa> but you give none of that
[03:44:11] <gproto23> why am i feeling that you are messing with me?
[03:44:25] <Wulf> gproto23: ask your shrink
[03:44:28] <wasamasa> you tell me
[03:44:46] <wasamasa> CTFs are about well-defined, educational challenges
[03:44:57] <wasamasa> you present an ill-defined thing that doesn't even appear to be a challenge

[03:52:23] <maroon> where is the rsa256 n on that page?
[03:53:46] <gproto23> wasamasa: it's just a local ctf i attended by invitation i realized before that also local services that also used there
[03:54:16] <wasamasa> what if it's not a crypto challenge, lol
[03:54:21] <wasamasa> what if you're barking up the wrong tree
[03:54:46] <maroon> are there any real world cases where they're actually still using rsa 512 or below?
[03:54:47] <wasamasa> what if it's something stupid like doing exactly the same stuff as in the ipython notebook, obtaining a token and finding a flag there
[03:56:15] <gproto23> wasamasa: i guess yeah i just thought so anyway sorry to bother you
[03:56:31] <maroon> where is the rsa256 n on that page?
[03:56:36] <wasamasa> normally these CTF challenges have extra metadata giving you a hint what you're supposed to do
[03:56:38] <Wulf> maroon: that's RS256, not rsa256
[03:56:39] <wasamasa> like, category: web
[03:56:48] <Peng> maroon: Handful of DNSSEC operators are doing it, IIRC
[03:56:55] <bgs> maroon: I think some asian country uses 512 bit rsa in their covid certificates
[03:57:07] <Peng> bgs: D:
[03:57:29] <gproto23> infra and web yes
[03:57:29] <Wulf> maroon: RS256 means "RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-256". The key size on github is 2048 bits with e=65537.
[03:58:11] <wasamasa> lol
[03:58:21] <wasamasa> so there's no indication it's a crypto problem
[03:58:25] <Peng> maroon: ~8600 domains according to https://stats.dnssec-tools.org/ :D
[03:58:26] <wasamasa> it might as well be something else
[03:58:35] <wasamasa> like SSRF or something other stupid
[03:58:58] <maroon> well i can factor 256, dunno about 512 though
[03:59:18] <Wulf> the github link is unrelated to CTFs, as far as I can tell.
[03:59:56] <wasamasa> that, too
[04:00:23] <gproto23> really smart aleck
[04:00:52] <Wulf> gproto23: ?  aleck didn't say anything.
[04:01:01] <Peng> maroon: Well if you steal a rich person's credit card and AWS's fraud detection isn't working very well...
[04:01:17] <gproto23> haha
[04:01:50] <wasamasa> anyway
[04:02:17] <wasamasa> I get quite pissed when I see people frequent some channel and straight ask how to solve a CTF challenge I've put up
[04:02:21] <snappy> maroon: i was reading a crypto audit of the whatsapp end to end encrypted backups, and i think i read they used rsa-512 somewhere
[04:02:22] <wasamasa> while the CTF is running of course
[04:02:27] <snappy> i have no fucking idea how that could even happen
[04:02:57] <Wulf> snappy: special request from NSA?
[04:03:19] <maroon> if theres a secret that needs to be kept for a few minutes, it's probably fine
[04:03:27] <snappy> https://research.nccgroup.com/2021/10/27/public-report-whatsapp-end-to-end-encrypted-backups-security-assessment/
[04:03:55] <snappy> everything else seemed to be modern crypto, using OPAQUE, etc.

[05:30:43] <Guest36> Do we need to exchange keys first in order for the other party to decrypt the message
[05:31:13] <Guest36> (obviously we do) so my question is do we still use the diffie hellman key exchange or something else?

[20:43:01] <moose> I think people who claim we live in some horrible world, city, state, country, whatever... unless they live in a select few places, have probably never experienced true hardship.
[20:43:48] <moose> True hardship doesn't exist in first world nations. It barely exists in second world nations even.
[20:43:52] <halosghost> moose: “dystopia” ≠ hellscape
[20:44:02] <halosghost> also, I don't really agree
[20:44:12] <halosghost> but then, this is all a bit of a bikeshed (I vote for “blue”)
[20:44:12] <moose> A dystopia is the opposite of a utopia. It's bad. It's the opposite of an idealist society.
[20:45:35] <moose> What exactly is the bike shed here?
[20:46:25] <moose> I'm just responding to your claim that we live in a capitalist dystopia which isn't clear already but I took it to meant a dystopia (in the majority perspective) run by thriving capitalists.
[20:47:12] <halosghost> what we should call our current economic and social systems' preference for giving more power to those that already have it and disenfranchising those who are already disadvantaged
[20:47:15] <halosghost> I'd call that dystopic
[20:47:26] <halosghost> but then, I also think blue is a nice color to paint a bike shed
[20:47:44] <halosghost> neither is necessarily moving forward our society (nor cryptography specifically)
[20:47:57] <halosghost> and indeed, I was responding to a comment that someone else made before you joined ☺
[20:48:29] <moose> Aye
[20:48:53] <moose> Naturally any society gives more power to people already in power. There is no society which has not done that which has ever been discovered or documented.
[20:49:23] <halosghost> not entirely sure I agree, but then, that (for me) would just suggest that humankind is prone to creating dystopias
[20:49:26] <moose> Even take a small circle like a household. There's a power dynamic in all households and no two people are equal, there's always someone more in power.
[20:49:29] <halosghost> which… doesn't bode well

They're not an influencer, they're not physically dominant, and they're teased by the powerful kids. Without doing something about it, namely resorting to violence or influencing more powerful people, they're going to stay on the bottom.

[20:58:09] <kashire> lol
[20:58:38] <halosghost> (e.g., someone a few years ago managed to create a C-esque language on top of quantum gates allowing you to program QCs in nearly-C; I found that paper interesting, but… quite dry; I have no idea of IBM's machine can run it)

Netflix watching losers aside, people control each other's language, women sell their bodies for food and to pay rent, usury is out of control, and while many, many people seems "critical" of capitalism, they all refuse to reject the circuses and bread.

[21:14:45] <halosghost> I'd actually also be interested in a /msg with some discussion of how it is an offensive term (my immediate searching is mostly leading only to the things I'm aware of, which are predominantly cases where people have lobbed it at me as an insult)

[21:14:54] <iz> probabilities are just waves that can be added and subtracted and manipulated
[21:15:34] <TimMc> moose: That was just a flippant remark about the origins of the term. I know that words change. Like I said, I'm skeptical (this is the first I've heard anyone complain) but I am indeed very much open to reading some piece arguing for the term being a problem. Probably not in-channel, though.
[21:15:39] <moose> kashire: You personally gain from being spied upon in most nations, more than you realized. You also live in a society that values equality and desires to control the use of oppressive terms so we don't get back to lynching black people as a day to day thing or preventing homosexuals (or anyone else) from marrying or women from voting.
[21:15:53] <moose> TimMc: Fair enough.
[21:16:24] <moose> kashire: So yeah there's going to be some control. Naturally things progress this way. Is it abused? Absolutely. But is it better than abolishing it? Yes, in my opinion it is.

[21:22:35] <halosghost> moose: I find that kind of fascinating; how do you square those two opposing forces? (feeling that surveillance is neccessary, but wanting the strongest cryptographic privacy possible?)
[21:23:00] <moose> halosghost: As a person who has worked in intelligence, most serious criminals and terrorists don't utilize strong crypto.
[21:23:21] <kashire> It also doesn't really contradict. Cat and mouse is generally good for development for both sides.
[21:23:21] <moose> They also leak data in other ways, bad processes, human issues, etc
[21:23:27] <halosghost> moose: but there's no reason they couldn't, right? and it's getting easier to all the time (e.g., signal)
[21:23:31] <TimMc> halosghost: In particular, the cryptobox construction is fantastic -- deniably authenticated encryption.
[21:23:44] <halosghost> kashire: I feel like only the cats would agree with that
[21:23:47] <moose> halosghost: That's if you believe signal is actually secure against a nation-state adversary
[21:24:06] <kashire> I'd rather use xmpp+omemo than signal.
[21:24:15] <halosghost> moose: I make no assertion other than that using strong-crypto is getting progressively easier
[21:24:32] <halosghost> (which would seem to be counter to the want for functioning surveillance)
[21:24:35] <kashire> halosghost: Yeah, but crypto isn't the only attack vector.
[21:24:35] <moose> halosghost: It is getting easier. iMessage for example has end to end encryption that is very tamper evident.
[21:24:49] <halosghost> I agree
[21:24:52] <moose> However even with these amazing systems, people still use pizzaIsGreat23! as a password.
[21:24:56] <halosghost> (as much as I do for signal, anyway)
[21:24:59] <halosghost> lol
[21:25:09] <moose> Also a lot of criminals gloat about stuff.

[21:25:21] <halosghost> opsec is quite hard

[21:26:07] <moose> Every single company in the US that sells software at scale has someone from a government intelligence sector agency implanted.
[21:26:10] <halosghost> TimMc: mmm, and it doesn't provide a wrapper around /dev/urandom or something to provide reasonably-secure nonces?
[21:26:12] <moose> Literally every single one, not exaggerating here.
[21:26:19] <halosghost> (that's kind of a bummer; it's been a while since I looked into it)
[21:26:36] <moose> The odds that someone it this channel works for a government agency is extremely high.
[21:26:56] <moose> I would say there's definitely 1, probably up to 10 given the subject matter.
[21:27:00] <halosghost> I mean, more likely than most channels probably
[21:27:04] <halosghost> that doesn't shock me
[21:27:08] <TimMc> halosghost: I believe it's got a perfectly good randomness faucet somewhere, but you have to know that you need to plug that together with the "nonce goes here".
[21:27:22] <moose> halosghost: Even on gaming stuff like Discord there's tons of people who are working for the government who are there to spy on people.
[21:27:22] <halosghost> interesting
[21:27:34] <kashire> Yeah, honestly. A buddy of mine in Finland is in jail because he couldn't shut up in our channel about how he is such a big drug dealer on "the darknet", then after evading arrest, kept connecting with his same name in places like France to brag about how he's "still not caught". People have a very hard time with opsec when you have something to talk about.
[21:27:35] <moose> Because cyber bullying, child trafficking, sexual abuse material production is there.
[21:27:38] <TimMc> halosghost: But when I looked at PyNaCl, the main Python wrapper for the lib, by default it does the nonce for you. So your mileage may vary.
[21:27:38] <halosghost> moose: well, though I'm not at all shocked by that, it does make me sad
[21:28:03] <moose> halosghost: So you'd prefer that the government be reactive instead of proactive? What about when kids are selling sexual images to predators online?
[21:28:03] <halosghost> TimMc: mmm, one day I hope to have evolved enough where dynamically-typed languages don't mostly feel bad

[21:28:59] <halosghost> moose: I don't know that I'm a privacy maximalist, but I'm much closer to that end of the spectrum than you are; however, I suppose I'd mostly say that we (as a species) aren't really ready to be trusted with turing-complete systems, so computers are kind of a whole can of worms

[21:29:27] <moose> But I advocate that our government should be allowed to collect intelligence on those signals that are unprotected.
[21:29:45] <moose> TimMc: Right and we can't let that sway us from building things like this.
[21:29:54] <moose> We have to understand that crypto is a "dual use" munition basically.
[21:29:57] <moose> It's a shield and a sword.
[21:30:17] <halosghost> more like a shield with really sharp edges
[21:30:29] <moose> So the important thing is to keep building with it, but never let people say we can't because of those potentially bad actors.
[21:30:32] <moose> Why? Because people will do it anyway.
[21:30:39] <moose> They may as well be funding the good guys when they do it.
[21:31:01] <moose> This is a maximin approach to the game of crypto if you will.
[21:31:19] <TimMc> a double-edged shield, lol
[21:31:23] <moose> You want to disadvantage your enemy as much as possible while reaping the most benefit. So, if they're going to get crypto anyway, they may as well be paying their attackers for it.
[21:31:33] <halosghost> TimMc: mmm, I like that a lot
[21:31:54] <moose> That also opens up the possibility for influence though, from same-sided governments. They'll ask you to backdoor stuff when some terror cell starts using it.
[21:32:13] <moose> Resist that at all costs, in my opinion.
[21:33:41] <moose> TimMc: I work on a parental control system that can work with social media and apps that utilize strong crypto without weakening it.
[21:33:42] <halosghost> moose: well, on the no-backdoors point, you and I are in absolute agreement
[21:33:43] <TimMc> Thinkin' about that Juniper backdoor that got turned against the US gov't.
[21:34:42] <moose> So you don't need to sacrifice your privacy to prevent kids from being preyed on. However, terrorists use Facebook/Discord/Signal/Telegram so just build the thing and hope nobody does worse than raiding the US capitol building with it.
[21:35:26] <moose> Terrorists are easy to spot, sexual predators are harder, which is why I made that comparison.
[21:35:27] <TimMc> moose: Mmm, like that Apple CSAM thing? I think they pulled part of that back, or at least delayed it.
[21:35:41] <moose> The Apple CSAM thing is active and works fine.
[21:35:47] <moose> It's not very good though.
[21:36:10] <halosghost> “works fine” and “not very good” feel to be significantly in-conflict to me
[21:36:22] <moose> Let me clarify haha
[21:36:30] <kashire> "works fine" and "not very good" make sense to me.
[21:36:36] <moose> It's working to detect people who have CSAM on their phones.
[21:36:58] <moose> But it's not very good because it's very invasive, has a high FP rate and gets manual review of your kiddos photos. Like kids in bathing suits are getting flagged. Armpits are flagged.
[21:36:58] <halosghost> that's what it's trying to do; do we have any stats on whether or not it actually succeeds at that?
[21:37:50] <moose> I have an internal report from Apple because they released it to all NCMEC/OJP partners.
[21:38:04] <moose> So I can't share it but I can say the FP rate is very high.
[21:38:09] <halosghost> moose: I suppose I agree with you on the “not very good” part then
[21:38:09] <TimMc> I find that I'm not as concerned about the component that tries to detect CSAM in a kid's communications.
[21:38:18] <halosghost> moose: sounds like we might disagree with whether or not it works ☺
[21:38:35] <kashire> Those degenerates love that kind of thing. Its flagging well, honestly.
[21:38:38] <TimMc> (because we already accept that kids may not have full privacy)
[21:38:41] <moose> It works in the sense of the software. The feature is out. It's detecting a lot of CSAM.
[21:38:46] <halosghost> kashire: …
[21:39:18] <halosghost> moose: having seen no numbers, “a lot” means nothing to me (not saying you're wrong, just saying that I've seen no evidence of that)
[21:39:21] <kashire> What does the underline mean, halosghost 
[21:39:28] <halosghost> kashire: it's an ellipsis
[21:39:35] <moose> TimMc: They're scanning all phones that are iCloud connected on-device for CSAM signatures which are fuzzy figure detections for things like the faces of known missing children along with a database of existing CSAM harvested from the internet.
[21:39:50] <moose> It has already assisted in finding abducted kids.
[21:39:58] <kashire> Oh, my font cannot render it properly.
[21:40:00] <TimMc> The component that scans people's photos for known fingerprints? That bugs the hell out of me, because despite being much more careful not to have false positives, it is turning *all* users' devices against them, and that's an extremely bad precedent.
[21:40:08] <kashire> That is what I get for a 9px bitmap font.
[21:40:19] <halosghost> TimMc: they're the same component ☺
[21:40:25] <moose> TimMc: I tend to agree a bit, but you can opt-out by not using iCloud.
[21:40:35] <halosghost> TimMc: just that in order to do the “find the bad stuff”, they have to do the “look at all the stuff”
[21:40:37] <TimMc> It's just iCloud for *now*.
[21:40:49] <TimMc> halosghost: I think they're different components that work differently.
[21:40:57] <halosghost> that is not my understanding
[21:41:10] <halosghost> (which is not to say that's not true, only to say that's not what I've read and understood)
[21:41:10] <TimMc> The child-safety one is a generic nudity-detection thing, no?
[21:41:21] <moose> TimMc: The one for iMessage is yes.
[21:41:25] <TimMc> The cloud images one is comparing for specific known perceptual hashes.
[21:41:39] <moose> Any nudity between an account that is established on iCloud as a child account and any other account will alert the parent.
[21:41:43] <moose> It also prevents receipt/sending of the message.
[21:42:16] <moose> It's all on-device, so the unencrypted images never leave the phone.

[21:45:34] <moose> It has the possibility, especially in countries where the government dictates things. China, for example, dictates the results Google can show and also how Apple devices perform scanning.
[21:45:35] <TimMc> It would be *extremely* easy for that to be adjusted so that China can find who's sharing dissident memes.
[21:45:52] <moose> It's possible that a government such as that of China could add anti-Chinese content detection.
[21:46:04] <moose> Yep.
[21:46:26] <moose> However in this context, the government of China is an example of a bad actor, much like people using crypto for evil.
[21:46:29] <TimMc> And Apple has already shown that they're fine with that sort of thing.
[21:47:14] <moose> How so?
[21:47:40] <TimMc> Well, they've built censorship stuff into their OS for China already.
[21:47:47] <moose> Example?
[21:48:17] <TimMc> The only thing that comes to mind that I can specifically cite was that there's some kind of geofence or country-of-origin thing where the Taiwan flag emoji is removed for people in China.
[21:48:38] <TimMc> but I recall there being other, larger things
[21:49:06] <moose> lol that's really dumb
[21:49:13] <TimMc> very petty
[21:49:15] <moose> Yeah
[21:49:23] <moose> It reminds me of when they argued about the Microsoft time zone tables.
[21:49:45] <moose> Some countries define time zone borders differently and the versions of Windows released to China had to have different ones to show those Chinese-determined borders.
[21:50:11] <TimMc> (I think it made the news because they screwed up and a whole bunch of people outside of China suddenly couldn't use the Taiwan emoji, but I may be confusing it with a similar story.)
[21:53:20] <halosghost> I wish there were a library that tried to expose as many cryptographic primitives as possible with a unified API (and specific warnings on primitives with known vulnerabilities)
[21:53:57] <halosghost> I know that libsodium is doing part of that, but it's trying to be more careful about its curatorial duties; I'd be interested in one that tries to include as many as possible (down to caeser ciphers even)
[21:55:56] <rqsd> OpenSSL libcrypto EVP?
[21:56:28] <TimMc> That feels like a bad idea to me although I'm having some difficulty articulating why.
[21:57:34] <moose> TimMc: Because people will use broken primitives by mistake.
[21:57:48] <moose> It's very easy to pick a primitive or a cipher construction that is weak in certain use cases.
