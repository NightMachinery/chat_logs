[01:35:29] <cis> Why does znc sometimes drop the connection to Libera, then log me back in as a Guest nick? It seems to happen sometimes when the machine I'm connecting with to my znc server goes to sleep.
[01:37:42] <gothkat> cis, I assume your nick is registered? Does ZNC authenticate with your nick somehow? At a minimum the access list will avoid you getting renamed. 
[01:38:06] <Casper> Best to use [[sasl]] with Libera.
[01:38:06] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/sasl
[01:38:17] <cis> Yeah, it's registered. I have the sasl module enabled.
[01:40:33] <cis> Maybe I didn't have the module configured properly. Hopefully it is now... and I'll see what happens next time.
[01:42:05] <gothkat> You can always /znc jump and watch what happens for yourself.
[01:42:07] <Casper> You could do "/znc *sasl verbose true" 
[01:42:13] <cis> gothkat: what do you mean by access list?
[01:42:15] <Casper> And then reconnect indeed :p
[01:42:26] <cis> Casper: yeah, I turned on verbose logging and made sure user/pass and RequireAuth are set
[01:43:00] <Casper> Do note that in case services are split and you get disconnected, it'll only try a re-connect once and then poop out.
[01:43:08] <gothkat> cis, SASL is better than the access list if you can make it work. Access list is a feature to tell NickServ to kinda trust you based on your hostmask. And anybody else who can use your hostmask.

[17:45:50] <DarthGandalf> Mikro: I think this is specific to irccloud, actually. Do you know what exactly they send on wire?
[17:46:07] <Mikro> oh, no, perhaps i should start there :D

[19:14:51] <Casper> AncientWisdom, nope.
[19:15:04] <Casper> Your listeners are assigned globally.
[19:15:13] <Casper> They have no clue what network someone is connecting for.
[19:15:16] <AncientWisdom> Casper:  ok thx
[19:15:29] <Casper> You'd have to use a 2nd ZNC instance if you want separate SSL certs.
[19:15:40] <AncientWisdom> Probably a feature in future?
[19:15:53] <AncientWisdom> Yes, that we can do.

[19:17:00] <AncientWisdom> Casper:  reason for asking is some hostings may want to serv ZNC via clearnet (which is ok with public ss-cert) while some may want to host ZNC via TOR (which may require a self-signed cert).
[19:17:10] <Casper> Nope, won't be a feature. It's just not possible.
[19:17:18] <AncientWisdom> ah ok... noted
[19:18:39] <Casper> If you want to do it with TOR etc, then it could be bindings on specific IP addresses, that might be possible, but I don't see it being implemented (or at least anytime soon).
[19:18:54] <Casper> You could use nginx for example to do that though.
[19:19:08] <Casper> Bind clearnet IP with one cert, and an internal TOR IP to a different cert.
[19:19:09] <AncientWisdom> yes, we hv done it that way... and terminate the ssl points with nginx
[19:19:39] <Casper> DarthGandalf, any plans on SSL cert per listener? :P
[19:19:47] <AncientWisdom> :D
[19:21:52] <AncientWisdom> Casper: Of course, that works if everything is within the reach of a hosting provider with full root access. Surely, having such 3feature in ZNC itself would definitely a plus :D

[20:57:15] <DoctorD90> hello everyone! Im fixing a couple of personal stuff during vacation (as usual about my vps/code eheh) and I was thinking about web server...my question is: znc has its own web version,, but what kind of security it improves? I mean, playing with Apache there are a lot of possible configurations for the security side. What about the znc?
[20:59:14] <DoctorD90> and: thinkging about the ssl page for znc.in, has anyone the original version of the image on the main page of the site? I mean the originals little image of which it is made up of? I would like to create an expicative image using the same style

[21:11:41] <DarthGandalf> Casper: are you interested in implementing this feature?
[21:11:42] <DarthGandalf> :)
[21:12:02] <Casper> DarthGandalf, my skills in writing are most likely not sufficient. :P 
[21:12:28] <Casper> But from that reaction it's safe to assume that it's not planned nor on any list?
[21:12:59] <DarthGandalf> I don't remember, maybe there's an open bug about it
[21:13:03] <DarthGandalf> I'd like to see it happen
[21:13:09] <DarthGandalf> I just don't have much time atm
[21:13:51] <AncientWisdom> Wonder if anyone ever brought up that idea - ssl in <network xxx> or separate listener? :)
[21:14:46] <AncientWisdom> Gandalf sure sounds like a *magical* person who can delivers wonders ;)
[21:14:50] <AncientWisdom> hehe
[21:14:53] <DarthGandalf> SSL settings like ciphers do belong to network and the listener, yes, but currently they are global
[21:15:24] <Casper> I don't see it under network tbh, only under listener.
[21:15:34] <DarthGandalf> Casper: that's the point
[21:15:37] <AncientWisdom> yes that is what is current
[21:15:56] <DarthGandalf> Now it's not even under listener
[21:16:01] <DarthGandalf> It's just global
[21:16:13] <AncientWisdom> yes, its top up global
[21:16:14] <DarthGandalf> But there's a workaround
[21:16:30] <Casper> DarthGandalf, but you're implying that SSL certs should belong to network and listener. I don't see how network would be possible. :p
[21:16:31] <DarthGandalf> If you want different ssl settings in front of it, put nginx proxy
[21:16:44] <DarthGandalf> Casper: not certs
[21:16:46] <DarthGandalf> ciphers
[21:16:58] <Casper> Ciphers still belong only to listeners and not networks imo. :p
[21:17:01] <AncientWisdom> DarthGandalf: yes, nginx proxying works for us
[21:17:01] <DarthGandalf> ecdha-eliptic, etc
[21:17:16] <DarthGandalf> Casper: why?
[21:17:28] <Casper> DarthGandalf, how can ZNC know which network you are connecting to before you've specified user and network?
[21:17:35] <DarthGandalf> ...
[21:17:39] <DarthGandalf> Not for that
[21:17:43] <DarthGandalf> For connecting 
[21:17:47] <DarthGandalf> When ZNC connects to server
[21:18:01] <Casper> Ah, the other side of the connection. :p
[21:18:35] <DarthGandalf> Now it's same cipher/sslv3 configuration as for listeners
[21:18:49] <DarthGandalf> s/3/2/
[21:18:50] <ZNC-Linker> DarthGandalf meant: “Now it's same cipher/sslv2 configuration as for listeners”
[21:19:14] <Casper> Ah, yeah, would be nice to have those split as well (even though I don't do much with that).
[21:20:43] <AncientWisdom> it is nice... users can opt for for using self-signed cert or CA-domain-cert for each network/listener plus diferent ciphers configurations.
[21:22:39] <DoctorD90> DarthGandalf, for ciphers on user-znc connection, how to manage them?

[22:03:09] <DoctorD90> perfect! thnk you DarthGandalf :) and about the original image in the homepage?
[22:03:41] <DarthGandalf> ??
[22:04:39] <MetaNova> <DoctorD90> and: thinkging about the ssl page for znc.in, has anyone the original version of the image on the main page of the site? I mean the originals little image of which it is made up of? I would like to create an expicative image using the same style
[22:05:07] <DoctorD90> thanks MetaNova :)
[22:08:14] <DarthGandalf> I don't understand you
[22:08:26] <DarthGandalf> You want screenshot of IDE with C++ code?
[22:10:01] <MetaNova> as far as I can understand, they're asking if there is a high-resolution version of https://wiki.znc.in/resources/assets/wiki.png available
[22:20:56] <DoctorD90> https://wiki.znc.in/File:Overview_network_scheme.png
[22:21:04] <DoctorD90> high resolution of these elements :)
[22:21:14] <MetaNova> oh, that
[22:21:33] <DoctorD90> sorry xD so focussed that I didnt though to link it
[22:21:36] <Casper> I assume those are Visio (or something alike) defaults :p 
[22:22:15] <DoctorD90> are they the default of visio? ok I will check :) Thanks Casper (on visio I didnt remember there were those icons)
[22:22:33] <Casper> Visio or draw.io I guess, could be another package too.
[22:22:38] <Casper> Might very well be draw.io tbh.
[22:24:20] <DoctorD90> ok thanks! I have visio on company's pc. Otherwise I will try with draw.io
[22:27:32] <Casper> draw.io at least has these https://i.cspr.cc/f7e336b325.png :P
[22:31:12] <DoctorD90> can't find the precise original version :/ meh....well...at least I have a starting point! thanks Casper 
[22:34:41] <Casper> No need for the precise original version, you can whip this up in 2 minutes on draw.io :P 
[22:51:28] <DarthGandalf> Someone needs to update that image to show several clients connected
[22:51:38] <DarthGandalf> and add some text labels

[23:12:17] <DoctorD90> and differentiatessl between clients and znc and znc with server (,aybe 2 different colors)
