[03:20:34] <KillerWasp> it's for study the code. phpbb and wordpress is very heavy for it.

[17:11:22] <__adrian> ham5: make the path a $variable. this way the script doesn't need to be actually located anywhere.
[17:13:20] <__adrian> using fully qualified paths is preferable anyway. e.g.,  $dir = "/path/to/dir1"; if (is_readable("{$dir}/your.file")) { ...
[17:13:34] <__adrian> then $dir can be loaded from config.
[17:17:23] <__adrian> also note blind use of PHP_SELF can cause problems - its value can include user input. very strongly recommend NEVER using it on your filesystem (especially since it's a kludgy/unnecessary solution anyway)

[17:25:06] <rdbeni0> hi all, it is possible to configure php.ini per project (via composer) ?
[17:25:19] <rdbeni0> not globally for whole server
[17:27:44] <__adrian> your php.ini cannot be configured by composer at all
[17:28:27] <__adrian> why would you need different settings anyway?
[17:28:29] <rdbeni0> :( ok dziƒôki
[17:35:02] <AllenJB> There are 2 options you might be able to use: If you're using PHP-FPM, you can configure ini settings using the pool configuration. Different projects can use different pools. It's also possible to configure PHP to look for per-directory ini files.
[17:36:20] <AllenJB> Also many ini settings can be set at runtime using ini_set()
[17:36:31] <ThePhilgrim> Hey guys! For my website project, I was recommended to have a PHP file in the public dir (foo.php) that takes data from the client and sends it on to appropriate scripts outside of the public dir. After I have sent the data to foo.php, and it has been processed there, what is the process for sending that data on to bar.php?
[17:36:51] <ThePhilgrim> As in, how do I send data from one php file to another
[17:38:36] <AllenJB> ThePhilgrim: You can include / require other PHP files - in which case they act as part of the same script: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php
[17:39:33] <ThePhilgrim> AllenJB: Awesome! And security wise, it's solid? As in, the files outside of the public dir are safe even if they require/include foo.php?

[18:28:41] <noord> Beam: I am not familiar with memcached, but cache stores generally use default ttl
[18:29:03] <Beam> well can't be ttl, since it's happening way too often
[18:29:41] <Beam> well anything is possible, but unlikely that ttl is set by default to 1 second
[18:31:06] <Beam> i guess the getAllKeys() isn't very stable

[21:51:15] <Eugen80> trying to write phpunit test for myClass->diff(). diff method uses some constants, for example secondClass::INFO
[21:53:05] <da_wunder> so share your code and actual test - and really tell what is the real issue
[21:53:13] <Eugen80> if I start my test,  secondClass::INFO is not available in myClass->diff()
[21:53:45] <Blondie101010> why would it be available when you call it normally and not as a test?
[21:53:47] <da_wunder> ok, so that sounds like autoload problem
[21:54:00] <Blondie101010> plausible
[21:54:36] <Eugen80> normally it is available because of namespace
[21:55:06] <da_wunder> check your phpunit.xml.dist file, and ensure that it contains `bootstrap="vendor/autoload.php"`
[21:55:12] <da_wunder> assuming that you're using composer
[21:56:09] <da_wunder> and if not, then make your custom bootstrap file where you do everything what is needed to load your application
[21:58:11] <__adrian> "Eugen80> normally it is available because of namespace"  use use
[21:58:40] <__adrian> https://php.net/namespaces.importing
[21:58:56] <__adrian> strongly recommend `use` always (not "only when needed")
[21:59:24] <Eugen80> i'll try to build bootstrap file
[21:59:30] <da_wunder> your IDE should show show that kind of "errors" and provide helpers to add those "use" statements
[22:00:12] <da_wunder> Eugen80: first share your actual test class and that class that you're trying to test - it would help us a really much
[22:05:28] <Eugen80> this is my testfile: https://pastebin.com/981ja0iq
[22:10:23] <da_wunder> imo - that is test that has no point - you're testing that mocked class is returning something...
[22:10:58] <da_wunder> why not just create concrete Diff class and test that instead?
[22:11:10] <__adrian> ^ always prefer not mocking where possible
[22:11:41] <Eugen80> this is short version of what need to be tested
[22:11:43] <Eugen80> https://pastebin.com/gis5eHBL
[22:11:56] <__adrian> mocking is a workaround for an object that is not well-decoupled
[22:11:59] <Eugen80> my problem is - IssueReason::ID_ADDRESS is not available
[22:12:13] <__adrian> see my first comment
[22:12:19] <__adrian> alias it.
[22:13:20] <da_wunder> ^ so if that `IssueReason` lives somewhere else than `app\lib\contract` namespace you will see that error
[22:13:37] <__adrian> "__adrian> strongly recommend `use` always (not "only when needed")"
[22:13:53] <da_wunder> and if that code actually works, and you only get that error in your tests - then check your phpunit.dist.xml as I earlier mentioned
[22:14:29] <Eugen80> IssueReason lives in app\lib\contract. But my test does not
[22:14:47] <__adrian> Eugen80: did you see my comment above? did you read the link?
[22:15:58] <Eugen80> __adrian: now reading
[22:16:26] <da_wunder> __adrian: that test class itself is not using that that - so I think that Eugen80 is just missing this - "20:25 < da_wunder> check your phpunit.xml.dist file, and ensure that it contains `bootstrap="vendor/autoload.php"`"
[22:18:18] <__adrian> Eugen80: where's the error come from (what file and line)?
[22:18:55] <__adrian> note, _regardless_ of whether the other class is in the same namespace, strongly recommend you _always_ alias
[22:20:05] <da_wunder> __adrian: could you explain why you recommend that?
[22:20:15] <Eugen80> error: array_keys() expects parameter 1 to be array, null given. Line: first IF condition
[22:20:20] <__adrian> more obvious = less error prone
[22:20:43] <__adrian> also makes maintenance/refactoring easier
[22:21:16] <__adrian> Eugen80: which file? your test (981ja0iq) or your class (gis5eHBL)?
[22:21:54] <da_wunder> Eugen80: that is because you mock that class - and you don't tell what that $this->reasonsArr should be - please don't use mock
[22:22:37] <Eugen80> one sec, i'll try something
[22:23:17] <da_wunder> and that error is also showing you actual error in your `Diff` class - you don't have any default value for that `reasonsArr` and your method is expecting that is an array
[22:23:26] <da_wunder> and clearly it's not
[22:23:28] <__adrian> agreed. not exactly sure which, but one of these is the issue (and you SHOULD do all three anyway): *don't mock unless you absolutely can't avoid it  *always use `use`  *fix your error reporting settings (that "null given" error is not the first error you should have seen)
[22:24:00] <__adrian> ahhh, ok
[22:24:09] <__adrian> but still make sure about the error reporting
[22:24:32] <__adrian> private array $reasons = [];
[22:24:43] <da_wunder> ^

[22:25:07] *** Joins: de-facto (~de-facto@user/de-facto)
[22:25:57] <da_wunder> and really that code doesn't have any method to change that reasonsArr value, so that code should not work anyway
[22:26:33] <__adrian> it will "work" if fixed (won't be useful - i'm assuming this is not a complete example)
[22:26:51] <da_wunder> and if that is really "working" then you're not seeing actual errors - so check your error reporting settings as __adrian said
[22:27:04] <Eugen80> array_keys() expects parameter 1 to be array, null given - so it is second param?
[22:27:07] <Eugen80> oh..
[22:28:13] <Eugen80> yes, it can find my constant
[22:28:51] <__adrian> it's the first (only) parameter
[22:29:15] <da_wunder> that one - \array_keys($this->reasonsArr)
[22:29:24] <Eugen80> i mean the problem is the second param of in_array()
[22:29:53] <__adrian> yes, but that's not relevant. it's the _first_ argument of array_keys(), as your error message said
[22:30:04] <Eugen80> ok, I can make reasonsArr available..
[22:30:13] <da_wunder> your code doesn't set that `$this->reasonsArr` anywhere and that is the real problem here
[22:30:23] <__adrian> it's not "unavailable." it's not an array.
[22:30:30] <Eugen80> yes.. but i know how to set it
[22:30:33] <__adrian> you did  private $reasonsArr;
[22:30:39] <__adrian> you ought to do  private array $reasons = [];
[22:30:50] <da_wunder> ^
[22:30:54] <Eugen80> ok
[22:30:59] <__adrian> that way it's an array (and it cannot be changed to a non-array value)
[22:34:12] <Eugen80> I'm learning how to write unit tests. It is often hard to do. I need to do it for existing project
[22:35:42] <da_wunder> imho - the problem that you covered has nothing to with unit tests - your code itself just makes assuming that something is an array while it's not - so basically you need to refactor your code
[22:36:04] <__adrian> aside from "don't mock if you don't HAVE TO" your test is fine
[22:36:08] <__adrian> this is a code problem
[22:36:15] <__adrian> that your test found
[22:36:21] <__adrian> that's what tests are supposed to do
[22:36:22] <da_wunder> ^
[22:40:13] <Eugen80> >your code itself just makes assuming that something is an array while it's not   --- yes, i've fixed this already. But if code/project is written without unittests in mind, it is sometimes hard to handle all the dependencies in classes
[22:40:44] <Eugen80> for example db access
[22:41:41] <da_wunder> it's not
[22:42:22] <da_wunder> for tests you create test database, and load data to it via fixtures so that you can actually make real tests
[22:42:33] <__adrian> the key is: when your code needs something (e.g., a db connection), _give_ it. don't make your code make/find it on its own.
