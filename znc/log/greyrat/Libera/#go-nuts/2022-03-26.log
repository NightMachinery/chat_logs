[03:45:14] <fizzie> Even if they do, that shouldn't inherently be an issue at least from a data race perspective. The documentation is pretty explicit about it: "Clients are safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines." "Transports are safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines."

[05:57:06] <anarcat> hello folks
[05:57:09] <anarcat> i'm lost in go mod land
[05:57:27] <anarcat> i have this dependency in my project that has a bug with a (supposedly) working PR to fix it: https://github.com/Strubbl/wallabago/pull/19
[05:57:58] <anarcat> i somehow have this in my go.mod, which was updated with `go get -u`: require (github.com/Strubbl/wallabago v6.0.0+incompatible ) // more or less
[05:58:02] <anarcat> i tried: replace github.com/Strubbl/wallabago => github.com/simonfrey/wallabago patch-1
[05:58:09] <anarcat> but then i get /home/anarcat/go/src/gitlab.com/anarcat/wallabako/go.mod:13: replace github.com/simonfrey/wallabago: version "v1.0.1-0.20210117162249-afac782761b4" invalid: go.mod has post-v1 module path "github.com/Strubbl/wallabago/v6" at revision afac782761b4

[06:20:27] <anarcat> this used to be so simple: i would just change the "import" URL to a fork and things would just work
[06:20:37] <anarcat> now i can't seem to just use another fork for my project, this is hellish
[06:20:57] <fizzie> Sounds like you should be using the module path with the major version suffix (/v6) throughout. Like, import with that, and require with that in your go.mod, and also replace with that. In Go terms, different major versions are pretty close to being entirely separate modules (in that a single project may depend on more than one of them).
[06:21:38] <anarcat> so import "github.com/Strubbl/wallabago/v6"?
[06:22:17] <anarcat> and in go.mod too i guess
[06:22:22] <fizzie> Yep.
[06:22:26] <anarcat> phew.
[06:22:30] <anarcat> i gotta say
[06:22:32] <anarcat> i hate this :p
[06:22:36] <anarcat> it works though, thanks

[06:24:43] <anarcat> go get -u seems to remove my "patch-1" in the replace
[06:24:44] <anarcat> e.g.
[06:24:45] <anarcat> -replace github.com/Strubbl/wallabago/v6 v6.0.0+incompatible => github.com/simonfrey/wallabago/v6 patch-1
[06:24:54] <anarcat> +replace github.com/Strubbl/wallabago/v6 v6.0.0+incompatible => github.com/simonfrey/wallabago/v6 v6.0.7-0.20210117162249-afac782761b4
[06:30:58] *** Joins: treeford (~charleste@user/treeford)
[06:31:35] <fizzie> Yeah, I think it does that, since "patch-1" might change over time, while "v6.0.7-0.20210117162249-afac782761b4" will always refer to a specific commit (the current head of patch-1, it would seem; that's the afac782... commit).
[06:32:04] <anarcat> i see
[06:32:12] <anarcat> thanks
[06:32:18] <anarcat> hopefully that branch will be short-lived :p
[06:32:54] <anarcat> last significant coding i did on this project was 2 years ago and the commit log was "yolo dep"
[06:33:33] <anarcat> someone else provided the patch to do the go.mod stuff
[06:35:00] <fizzie> FTR, the rationale behind the /v6 suffix is, a new major version by definition means a compatibility-breaking change, but while *you* might want to depend on a v6.x.y to get the fancy new features, you might also depend on "github.com/cool/library", which depends on a v5.x.y version, and the author is out on an extended year-long hiking trip somewhere and isn't going to update that code any time
[06:35:02] <fizzie> soon. If the major version was not part of the module path, it would force "github.com/Strubbl/wallabago" to map to a single major version, and then you couldn't build a codebase without getting all its deps to switch to v6. https://research.swtch.com/vgo-import#dependency_story goes on in depth about it.

[06:43:36] <anarcat> how can i pick the right one as a commandline flag?
[06:44:13] <anarcat> i know about tags, and i tried copying the file over and adding `go:build gosqlite` in one file and `go:build !gosqlite` in the other, but then the compiler warns the function is defined twice
[06:46:58] <anarcat> oh i think i know, i'll pass the value to the linker
[06:47:05] <anarcat> i already do that for the version
[06:50:08] <fizzie> Hmm, using build tags for that sort of thing *should* work. As in, if you've got the same function (or variable) in two different files with mutually exclusive build tags, it shouldn't be an error.
[06:51:25] <fizzie> There's a bunch of quirks with the syntax though, what with the old +build syntax, the new go:build one and all. Different rules around where in the file they must be, and so on.
[06:51:31] <anarcat> file a: // go:build modernc

[06:58:23] <fizzie> Tcl had something to do with the tests.
[06:58:52] <fizzie> So hopefully it won't actually end up in the binaries, even if it's a dependency of the module technically.
[06:59:54] <anarcat> well there's also stuff like modernc.org/cc modernc.org/ccgo

[22:45:01] <nebiros> quick question, I implement a worker pool in order to speed up this thing, basically to do multiple http requests concurrently, at the end the response time is equal that doing requests 1-by-1, I think is because I add a lock at my http client, cause I was getting some data races here: Read at 0x00c0004c6230 by goroutine 48: net/textproto.MIMEHeader.Get(), Previous write at 0x00c0004c6230 by goroutine
[22:45:07] <nebiros> 66: net/textproto.MIMEHeader.Set(), if I remove the lock it works faster but I start getting those data races again
[22:45:32] <nebiros> I mean, the http.Header seems like is not "thread safe"
