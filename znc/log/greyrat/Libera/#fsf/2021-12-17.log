[00:29:01] <lispmacs[work]> except this one guy who built his own printer, but it was a rather crude machine

[20:00:49] <gnoo> oh, but i was talking about non-maintainers knowing who was a maintainer

[21:39:48] <user9> craigt: quick question since I've got you, I'm looking at aclock which is a gnustep program, gnustep is part of gnu from my understanding, and when you go to gnu.org, the donate button takes you to my.fsf.org/donate. In light of that, I assume all donation related entries should basically reflect the status of my.fsf.org/donate? 
[21:40:53] <craigt> Oops! We are into hour two of this week's Free Software Directory Meeting.

[21:43:39] <craigt> user9: I'm not sure what you mean by "donation related entries" Do you have an example?
[21:43:52] <tfisgnag> must check or must compare
[21:44:41] <user9> well I'm updating the crypto donation status, so one would be the 'accepts crypto donations' checkbox

[21:56:27] <Noisytoot> kompowiec, Is that an official FSF channel? If not, it's in the wrong namespace.
[21:57:11] <user9> craigt: am I correct that gnustep and packages for it should all just be considered part of gnu and therefore point to the fsf donation page?
[21:57:21] <craigt> user9: So the GnuStep FSD entry should have a link to the fsf.org donation page and have accepts crypto. Is that what we are talking about?
[21:58:08] <user9> craigt: yep I think we're on the same page. Specifically what led me to gnustep though was the program called aclock. It's written for gnustep...
[21:58:48] <user9> craigt: so my question also is, should all programs under gnustep be considered all under the gnu umbrella, and therefore point to fsf for donations? 
[21:58:50] <craigt> user9: gnustep also accepts donations through SPI Inc, but if the FSD entry can only have one, I would go with the fsf.org

[22:20:14] <craigt> user9: I could not figure it out. But http://wiki.gnustep.org/index.php/GNUstepWiki:Site_support has the fsf.org link, so that works for me.

[22:27:24] <user9> craigt: to be clear, aclock should not link to fsf since it is a seperate project from gnustep and likely was just ported I guess
[22:28:28] <user9> but gnustep itself, when I get there, should point to fsf?
[22:28:45] <craigt> user9: aclock definitely seems a separate project from gnustep (outside of the fact it was written for it).
[22:29:26] <craigt> user9:  Yes for gnustep; http://wiki.gnustep.org/index.php/GNUstepWiki:Site_support has the fsf.org link, so that seems appropriate for the FSD.
[22:29:44] <user9> craigt: got it 
[22:30:18] <craigt> andrzejku: Ah, thank you.
[22:31:16] <andrzejku> craigt, we decided to unite our forces and try to popularize Free Software on phones using postmarket os

[22:53:02] <craigt> tfisgnag: We want to update the download link for the version we reviewed and update the licensing page of the entry.
[22:54:37] <tfisgnag> craigt: I haven't logged into the FSD today. I'll let you know when I'm in. Right?
[22:55:02] <craigt> tfisgnag: Sounds good.
[22:58:49] <tfisgnag> craigt: I am at https://directory.fsf.org/wiki?title=Mailvelope&action=formedit#tab=2__License . Should I move to somewhere  else?
[23:00:25] <craigt> tfisgnag: That is the right place. We want to update that we verified the AGPLv3.

[23:03:03] <craigt> tfisgnag: Yes, update that to today and put our names in the verified by field.
[23:06:44] <tfisgnag> I changed the date, and added my name and then yours to Ted Teah's name. Correct?
[23:06:57] <craigt> tfisgnag: Correct.
[23:07:09] <craigt> tfisgnag: Before you save, we want to update the download link.
[23:07:51] <tfisgnag> That requires moving to another URL . Doesn't it?
[23:08:22] <craigt> tfisgnag: You should be able to navigate between the tabs.
[23:09:47] <craigt> tfisgnag: It changes the URL but doesn't refresh the page, so your changes to License should stay in place.
