[08:25:34] <ButterNoodle> lol
[08:25:36] <ButterNoodle> thats funny
[08:26:12] <JesseDesu> coincidence?
[08:29:30] <Nanobot> If you're feeling sad, just remember that the sadness won't be here forever. Sorta like Coco.
[08:29:43] <ButterNoodle> jesus

[08:30:09] <ButterNoodle> Nanobot: mysql make run better
[08:30:10] <ButterNoodle> how to
[08:30:14] <ButterNoodle> ?
[08:30:34] <JesseDesu> !findquote mysql
[08:30:35] <ImoutoBot> JesseDesu: (28 / 155) <S‚Äãmeef> Here I am 2 AM on a Sunday morning, migrain‚Äãe like a fuckin' hydrogen bomb, firefighting PDF gen‚Äãerators and MySQL databases. I'm feel like I'm gonna throw up
[08:30:41] <Nanobot> I don't use MySQL anymore. But, I remember there's a lot of performance-related options that can be tweaked.
[08:30:58] <ButterNoodle> its a small table.. about 50M rows and 8gb..
[08:31:24] <JesseDesu> what kinda table
[08:31:25] <Nanobot> Table scan or index scan?
[08:31:30] <ButterNoodle> with shouldnt I be able to full text that on a reasonable powered box?
[08:31:38] <ButterNoodle> either one is shit
[08:31:53] <Nanobot> Full text indexes generally suck.
[08:31:54] <ButterNoodle> unless its on a small column
[08:32:16] <ButterNoodle> and they suck to recreated on creation
[08:32:22] <JesseDesu> excel has a maximum of 1,048,576 rows
[08:32:53] <JesseDesu> whats the max on a database
[08:33:07] <ButterNoodle> how much ram and hard drive u got?
[08:33:21] <JesseDesu> 16gb
[08:33:28] <JesseDesu> and uh
[08:33:41] <Nanobot> I told an Indonesian person that the only Indonesian word I knew was "halu". He laughed. Then, a Japanese speaker looked it up and asked me why that's the only Indonesian word I know.
[08:33:42] <JesseDesu> i need to recalculate since i've been downloads lots of anime
[08:33:48] <JesseDesu> downloading
[08:33:54] <Sadale> JesseDesu, maybe I'll give lovely complex a try.
[08:34:13] <Nanobot> SAY! Hey hey heyhey hey hey hey hey
[08:34:13] <JesseDesu> sadale that was butters rec
[08:34:14] <ButterNoodle> lol Nanobot 
[08:34:21] <Sadale> oh.
[08:34:27] <Sadale> sorry JesseDesu xD
[08:34:43] <JesseDesu> i started downloading lovely complex
[08:34:44] <ButterNoodle> :) Sadale no cute sister
[08:34:48] <ButterNoodle> but its cute
[08:34:49] <JesseDesu> but i paused it for orange
[08:35:25] <Nanobot> PostgreSQL is just generally better than MySQL these days. MySQL used to have a performance advantage for typical use cases, but I don't think that's really the case anymore.
[08:35:39] <ButterNoodle> why the shit is this insert query double inserting... 
[08:35:47] <ButterNoodle> stop double penetrating my tables
[08:36:04] <ButterNoodle> Nanobot: postgre scares me because I dont know how to manage it
[08:36:52] <ButterNoodle> outside of phppgmysqladmin
[08:36:55] <Nanobot> I used to be the same way. But then I decided to just spend a day figuring it out.

[08:37:26] <ButterNoodle> the network management platform I support is backended in pg
[08:37:37] <ButterNoodle> could be helpful for something splunk-ey
[08:39:01] <Nanobot> Coco's final Minecraft stream just ended.

[08:46:03] <Sadale> There was a golden age for this kind of anime. Now it's gone :(
[08:46:16] <ButterNoodle> just watch normie anime w ur imouto snuggled up to you...
[08:46:19] <ButterNoodle> even better
[08:46:27] <Sadale> awww >w<
[08:46:36] <Sadale> nah that ain't gonna happen :'(
[08:46:44] <ButterNoodle> ;~;
[08:46:54] <Sadale> at least not any time soon. :(
[08:47:14] <ButterNoodle> uncle noodle is gonna need to have a word with her
[08:48:51] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, If you play osu or yandere (now gone) while me and her are around, you could talk to her.
[08:49:11] <Sadale> And so far we welcome people to join our osu sessions. :3
[08:49:30] <Sadale> Usually it's just me and my imouto. But sometimes if I could get an IRC user to join, she'd be happy as well.
[08:50:23] <ButterNoodle> wow, I'd be honored.. but I dont osu :<
[08:50:41] <Sadale> too bad! :P
[08:50:49] <ButterNoodle> rip, I never played yandere
[08:51:08] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, doesn't matter tho. Newbies would also be welcomed. We're happy to play the ones with lower difficulty if the IRC user's new to the game.
[08:51:27] <Sadale> In fact she's far better than me in osu. And while I'm playing with her she has to play the less difficult one for me.
[08:51:28] <ButterNoodle> its like beat saber
[08:51:30] <ButterNoodle> but smaller
[08:51:46] <Sadale> kind of. It's just a rhythm game. You just click circles. That's it.
[08:51:58] <ButterNoodle> is it mouse?
[08:52:00] <Sadale> yep
[08:52:11] <Sadale> mouse or touchscreen or graphical drawing tablet.
[08:52:16] <ButterNoodle> woah I could use my 1500000 dpi mouse
[08:52:17] <Sadale> Most players use mouse tho
[08:52:48] <treeman5> what game u playong
[08:53:27] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, so do let me know if you're interested. If that's the case I could ping you whenever you could join with me and my imouto. xD
[08:53:42] <Sadale> I mostly play those dumb flash games and those lame FOSS games
[08:53:53] <Sadale> Oh. I own a copy of factorio as well. I kind of like it.
[08:54:10] <ButterNoodle> I have a lot of stuff on steam...
[08:54:14] <ButterNoodle> I may have that too
[08:54:41] <ButterNoodle> or maybe I am thinking of satisfactory
[08:55:41] <Sadale> aww I don't like those games that's only available on steam
[08:56:01] <ButterNoodle> I buy stuff on steam and never play it :|
[08:56:15] <ButterNoodle> xplane and microsoft flight sim aside
[08:56:19] <ButterNoodle> and beat saber
[08:56:35] <ButterNoodle> I wanna play viva project again
[08:56:38] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, interesting. The theme of satisfactory totally sounds like factorioo
[08:56:59] <Sadale> except that it's 3D
[08:57:09] <ButterNoodle> its close.. I think factorio is 3rd person and satisfactory is first person
[08:57:28] <JesseDesu> oh man
[08:57:32] <JesseDesu> orange is sad
[08:57:40] <JesseDesu> i'm done with ep 1

[08:57:49] <ButterNoodle> oh
[08:57:50] <JesseDesu> actually i'm on the credits of ep1
[08:57:55] <ButterNoodle> wait
[08:58:01] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, there's a character inside and you're controlling the character. Later on you could automate shit with drones tho.
[08:58:06] <ButterNoodle> it isnt a romcon :|
[08:58:17] <ButterNoodle> nice Sadale
[08:58:34] <ButterNoodle> I was a big sim city player when it came out
[08:58:43] <JesseDesu> did you see that video where drones kill a targeted individual
[08:58:57] <JesseDesu> it reads your face then puts an explosive through your forehead
[08:59:02] <Sadale> woah
[08:59:06] <Sadale> scary af
[08:59:18] <Sadale> Is that in a game or in real life?
[08:59:29] <JesseDesu> it was on youtube i think
[08:59:39] <JesseDesu> or some link i followed cuz i follow military stuff
[08:59:41] <ButterNoodle> and people think I am paranoid
[09:00:13] <ButterNoodle> when our idiot in chief implies using f15's and nukes on the american people
[09:00:28] <JesseDesu> who did
[09:00:30] <JesseDesu> trump?
[09:00:31] <Sadale> JesseDesu, What kind of drone it is tho? The 4-axis one that's available in the market?
[09:00:39] <ButterNoodle> yea the president
[09:00:42] <JesseDesu> its a small drone
[09:00:44] <JesseDesu> yes
[09:00:56] <JesseDesu> with a single shot explosive on it
[09:01:05] <JesseDesu> it identifies your face
[09:01:06] <Sadale> If I were whoever controling the drone tho I'd make it like kamikaze :P
[09:01:17] <Sadale> Just rampage into your face and self-explode
[09:01:40] <Sadale> I'm worried that it could misidentify tho
[09:01:49] <JesseDesu> this is why people will need gps spoofers
[09:01:51] <Sadale> That's be super scary.
[09:02:17] <JesseDesu> not just gps jammers but spoofers
[09:02:34] <JesseDesu> anyways

[09:13:41] <Nanobot> My hope is we could eventually get to the point where successful vtubers can buy the rights to their character and continue it outside the organization.
[09:14:04] <Vohveli> that would be great too

[09:15:05] <Arcorann> That happened with Miori Celesta (formerly of MyHolo TV, currently Tsunderia) right?

[09:52:49] <JesseDesu> i predicted i would
[09:53:52] <JesseDesu> i slept 38 hours after i last worked
[09:54:41] <theholyduck> thats not a.. normal amount
[09:54:48] <JesseDesu> and spent the last 5 hours watching whatever
[09:55:03] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: oh you liked colorful. That was a bit different anime
[09:55:04] <JesseDesu> theholyduck, its my weekend
[09:55:10] <theholyduck> JesseDesu: its still not a normal amount :P 
[09:55:21] <JesseDesu> i know its not
[09:55:21] <theholyduck> my record is like 30 hours with a toilet and eating break in the middle
[09:55:27] <theholyduck> and that was after a week of basicly not sleeping
[09:55:30] <theholyduck> at a lan party
[09:55:47] <prpldmn> calm down there partner
[09:56:06] <theholyduck> JesseDesu:  i mean the 2 most common reasons for sleeping a lot is being sick .or being like clinically depressed
[09:56:13] <theholyduck> in either case. maybe see a doctor
[09:56:19] <amigojapan> theholyduck: at my age. I tried doing an all night party. And I ended up sleeping 3 days in a row
[09:57:31] <amigojapan> I can't stay up all night anymore
[09:57:33] <JesseDesu> theholyduck, i drank at least 400-500mg of caffeine every day for a week before this happened
[09:57:46] <theholyduck> i mean. thats not that much
[09:57:55] <theholyduck> i take more than that in pill form every day
[09:58:00] <theholyduck> for years
[09:58:23] <JesseDesu> lol i used to do caffeine pills
[09:58:33] <JesseDesu> pretty fucked up
[09:58:33] <theholyduck> for me its just a cost saving measure
[09:58:42] <theholyduck> a bottle of caffeine pills is like the price of 3 energy drinks
[09:58:44] <amigojapan> theholyduck: the mayo clinic recommends a maximum of 400mg a day off cafine
[09:58:48] <theholyduck> and lasts a lot longer :P
[09:59:02] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  soo yeah 400-500mg a day is not that crazy
[09:59:10] <JesseDesu> theholyduck, seems pretty fucked up
[09:59:12] <theholyduck> its like normal coffee drinker level
[09:59:22] <theholyduck> JesseDesu: why? 
[09:59:32] <theholyduck> i take a pill when i wake up and a pill at mid day
[09:59:41] <JesseDesu> i used to do caffeine pills
[09:59:44] <theholyduck> and its like the same as 4 energy drinks 
[09:59:50] <theholyduck> or like 6 cups of coffeee or whatever
[10:00:00] <theholyduck> but much cheaper and more convenient
[10:00:12] <JesseDesu> i dunno man
[10:00:16] <JesseDesu> i just stopped
[10:00:30] <theholyduck> JesseDesu:  good for you. either way. as i said its just a cost saving measure. 
[10:00:36] <JesseDesu> it feels different
[10:00:57] <JesseDesu> straight caffeine pills feel odd
[10:01:39] <JesseDesu> i'm not talking to the right person about my sleep disorder
[10:01:48] <theholyduck> JesseDesu: hey i sleep 8 hours a day
[10:01:49] <JesseDesu> i just sleep cuz it feels good
[10:01:56] <JesseDesu> to not get up
[10:02:09] <theholyduck> JesseDesu: sure. as i said. sleeping al ong time is a classic sign of depression
[10:02:23] <theholyduck> hard to work up the motivation or energy to get out of bed. so you just doze off 
[10:02:57] <JesseDesu> i feel motivated under the gun
[10:03:07] <JesseDesu> of being fired
[10:03:16] <JesseDesu> for not showing up to work

[12:15:58] <dfch> amigojapan, xD
[12:16:08] <Sadale> dfch, oh cool. That place's expensive af tho >_<
[12:16:21] <Sadale> dfch, but wouldn't you need to do quarantine?
[12:16:25] <dfch> Sadale, nah not in lkf itself, but nearby
[12:16:31] <Sadale> ah.
[12:16:32] <dfch> also no quarantine
[12:16:43] <Sadale> I see. I haven't been catching up with the latest quarantine policy
[12:17:11] <dfch> When (or if) I'm coming back then yes, 14 days centralized + 7 days home quarantine (currentÔºå could be changed but idk)
[12:17:41] <dfch> Sadale, no quarantine for mainland entry since end of the march? Not sure exact date
[12:17:59] <Sadale> I've heard of it. I think it requires being vaccinated or something
[12:18:06] <Sadale> I think you're vaccinated tho. I haven't yet
[12:18:15] <dfch> Sadale, there's a talk of ÈÄöÂÖ≥ for guandong (if you vaccinated in HK free entry to ML)
[12:18:28] <Sadale> cool!
[12:18:29] <dfch> Sadale, nah getting my first shot tomorrow morning
[12:18:45] <Sadale> oh. That's later than I thought. I plan to get it next week but I'm too lazy to do the registration xD
[12:18:50] <Sadale> I mean the appointment
[12:18:50] <amigojapan> Sadale: actually the word "quarantine"comes from the word for 40 in Italian. They used to keep people 40 days on quarantine during the black plague
[12:18:55] <Sadale> amigojapan, I know
[12:19:01] <amigojapan> Ok
[12:19:30] <dfch> because being unvaccinated getting in the way these days (some bbq shops/bars/parks/beaches starting to ban entry for non-vaccinated)

[12:21:04] <amigojapan> dfch: I hope. I am one of the earliest people my age getting the vaccine in Japan

[12:25:57] <dfch> Earlier I had an option to get 1-doze vaccine, but opted out, because fuck that. 1-doze hangover is brutal according to my close contacts
[12:26:03] <dfch> Sadale, don't do 1doze one
[12:26:18] <dfch> either its cansino or j&j
[12:26:20] <Sadale> dfch, oh. Here both vaccines being offered are 2-doses.
[12:26:37] <amigojapan> dfch: j&j is also much less effective
[12:26:40] <dfch> Sadale, oh cansino isn't avail for general population? :O
[12:26:47] <dfch> amigojapan, and this, yes
[12:27:07] <Sadale> dfch, nope. We got sinovax and biontech.
[12:27:09] <dfch> efficacy sucks ass and hangover 
[12:27:27] <Sadale> wait
[12:28:02] <Sadale> dfch, to be precise, we got Sinovax CoronaVac and BioNTech Comirnaty
[12:28:14] <dfch> Sadale, I see, well most of the HKPF and Ê∂àÈò≤Â±Ä folk got cansino
[12:28:24] <Sadale> funny. how come?
[12:28:30] <Sadale> Where they got it?
[12:28:52] <dfch> that you should ask your local representative :p
[12:30:05] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Mewkledreamy Mix! | Episode: 3
[12:30:31] <dfch> On mainland cansino started at military then went on first responders, then shared with macau, then shared with ML Âπ≥Ê∞ë, then shared with HK
[12:30:40] <amigojapan> Remember that guy that was aggressive and saying "China will remember that Japan closed travel". Lol now every country blocked travel
[12:31:38] <Sadale> dfch, funny how cansino sounds like casino to me
[12:31:45] <Sadale> What a name
[12:31:56] <amigojapan> Sadale: I thought the same
[12:31:57] <dfch> but none of the Âπ≥Ê∞ë in macau had access to cansino, so I guess (have no friends/contacts operators over there) it went same route (police, first responders etc)
[12:31:59] <Sadale> I'd have picked a better name for a vacinne company.
[12:32:17] <prpldmn> im still not vaccinated unu
[12:32:23] <dfch> Sadale, read it in mando:  Â∫∑Â∏åËØ∫ÁîüÁâ©

[12:33:09] <Sadale> hope that I spelled the pinyin right.
[12:33:44] <prpldmn> amigojapan: maybe next month i can get my first dose
[12:33:48] <dfch> Sadale, that's the original name, basically military front for their biotech
[12:33:59] <amigojapan> Nice prpldmn 
[12:34:02] <dfch> and yes you spelled that right
[12:34:08] <Sadale> dfch, but still. I wouldn't want to call a vaccine company casino. It makes it sounds like that you're betting with your life xD
