[00:02:52] <patchvonbraun[m]> willcode4: I call firdes directly and stuff the output into variables.  But even if I had used a filter-coeffs block (which is just a short-hand for what I do manually), I'd still get bitten across the 3.8 to 3.9 boundary.
[00:07:49] <patchvonbraun[m]> Actually, I lied.  I'm using the convenience function.  But, still, bleh.

[23:41:46] <monkeye> I am looking for some help on a school project with rfcat and was wondering if this is a good place to ask
[23:42:13] <monkeye> its not exactly specific on rfcat, more to do with radios in general
[23:42:36] <Myon> it's worth a try
[23:43:44] <monkeye> well I am trying to send something from a radio dongle with rfcat, and receive it and decode it with an SDR dongle but I am in way over my head
[23:45:03] <monkeye> I have been sending signals using on off keying and I can see them on gqrx 
[23:45:04] *** Quits: hololeap (~hololeap@user/hololeap) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:46:16] <Myon> there's a few tutorials for starting
[23:46:27] *** Joins: hololeap (~hololeap@user/hololeap)
[23:47:27] <Myon> do you have to use a specific software, or does gqrx already count?
[23:48:31] <monkeye> I don't have to use a specific software. the whole project is:
[23:49:15] <monkeye> I need to type in assembly commands into stdin, send those to a beaglebone black over radio, decode them and then on the beaglebone decode the machine code to the actual instruction
[23:49:26] <monkeye> Im just having trouble with the radio part
[23:49:48] <monkeye> I would ask my professor for help but it is like.. a free project we can do what we want as long as it relates to assembly
[23:52:37] <monkeye> I used rtl_sdr to capture the signal into a .cu8 file and I used a program called inspectrum to analyze it and I was able to retrieve the symbols from it and convert it to binary but it doesnt match what im sending over rfcat but Im not entirely sure what im doing.
[23:58:03] <Myon> I don't see the connection to assembly here
[23:59:29] <Kevin-phasewrap[> if you are going to process SDR data with assembly you are definitely playing on hard mode :D
