[00:01:13] <hiya> It is PIP related. Just navigate to any streaming site like Youtube.com. Just set it to auto-play and drag one video to the end and let it auto-play to check, it not only cuts video from right but pushes it to the left of the screen if you keep it to the right most position.

[00:03:30] <hiya> Picture: https://ibb.co/nmKWMHs (see the control X, it cuts, the whole video cuts from right)
[00:04:17] <jeffmr> alkisg, that worked.  I had to force overwrite the package.  The sound quality isn't great and I can't use it with Google Duo on the web which was my intent.
[00:04:30] <jeffmr> Only the camera works but audio works with everything else.

[16:16:27] <ultramage> hi, could you give me a bit of advice on how to fix my Trac/subversion setup after updating? I'm on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS now, and Trac (a python web app) is reporting that the svn module is missing. It is supposed to be installed with the 'subversion' package as part of its python bindings. The manual says it wants svn 1.14 (came out 3 months ago), but apt-get is only giving me 1.13.

[16:35:45] <ultramage> it's possible that svn 1.14 is the first one that ships with python3 bindings, so the maintainers were waiting for that. Not sure. Trac also works with git and hg and other stuff, which probably wasn't affected.

[17:24:11] <ultramage> well, that is true, until you run into 'cutting edge' software that doesn't fit well with a snail-pace package repo.
[17:24:13] <mgedmin> I haven't ever looked to see if there are PPAs that backport subversion

[17:39:44] <alkisg> bailsman: in general, debian and ubuntu don't get newer packages into already released versions. There are a few exceptions like SRUs or security micro-releases.
[17:39:55] <alkisg> For prometheus-node-exporter 1.2, you can copy from impish to your own ppa, and install that one (or maybe even just download the .debs)
[17:40:17] <alkisg> I.e. https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=prometheus-node-exporter and click on download
[17:40:59] <bailsman> What's a SRU?

[17:42:55] <alkisg>  So if you're maintaining a lot of computers, you could build your own ppa, and copy things around from e.g. ubuntu impish to your focal ppa. Then you'd just need to updates said machines
[17:43:05] <alkisg> That takes a few minutes only
[17:46:21] <bailsman> How would you rate the chances of a SRU for the purposes of enabling TLS support and what kind of testing would it require to ensure that it doesn't regress? I can say "I upgraded my machine and it still worked" but that doesn't guarantee anything for the thousands (millions?) other users.
[17:47:00] <alkisg> SRU isn't very suitable for new releases; it's mostly for patches. You can look at backports or micro-releases

[18:02:23] <alkisg> Eeeh all that that you described is called "a PPA"
[18:02:39] <alkisg> But if you want it in your local repo, sure

[18:03:05] <bailsman> I mean yeah, that's an irrelevant detail innit. The hard part is the first half.
[18:03:19] <alkisg> The ppa is the repository part. While the launchpad build recipe is what downloads and builds the source and uploads it to the ppa

[18:07:05] <bailsman> Maybe it has never had a security issue :p
[18:07:16] <bailsman> OK, so maybe I need to make something to pull regularly from upstream instead.
[18:07:28] <bailsman> maybe installing docker daemon on every machine isn't so bad
[18:07:38] <bailsman> Or just migrate to centos
[18:07:50] <alkisg> Why, centos has more releases?
[18:08:10] <bailsman> I have relatively more confidence in epel than you're describing I should have for universe
[18:08:16] <alkisg> Btw why are you so concerned about security updates on this particular package, did it have any known security issues?
[18:08:20] <bailsman> and yes, it has node exporter >= 1.0
[18:08:32] <bailsman> alkisg: I'm worried about hypothetical security issues! And maybe about the general approach to software I have on my systems
[18:09:21] <alkisg> New upstream versions often introduce security issues
[18:09:24] <alkisg> Building from upstream isn't equivalent to "being safer"
[18:10:09] <alkisg> And I don't think centos has a better security record than ubuntu or debian... I haven't looked at any stats though
[18:10:50] *** Joins: EriC^^ (~e@178.135.3.220)
[18:11:04] <bailsman> Right - I realize I'm looking for something contradictory. I want >= 1.0 because it has a shiny new security feature (TLS support), but I also want then to keep it stable and only patch it for security issues.
[18:11:42] <alkisg> I think you should just download and install the impish .deb, if it's installable in focal
[18:12:58] <bailsman> To be honest, I think that's irresponsible advice - maybe I'll get away with that for just prometheus-node-exporter, but that general approach to managing software on my servers has a flaw - if one of them does get a security issue, that'll just slip right under the radar and it will be unpatched and vulnerable forever.
[18:13:24] <alkisg> How so, won't it still receive updates?
[18:13:38] <rbasak_> It will not.
[18:13:43] *** rbasak_ is now known as rbasak
[18:13:50] <alkisg> rbasak_: sure, if the version number is greater
[18:14:01] <rbasak> No, because apt won't see it.

[18:14:22] *** Quits: webchat20 (~webchat20@109.53.1.147) (Quit: Client closed)
[18:14:47] <bailsman> I think you're right - if a security update were to be pushed to focal repos with a version number greater than the release in impish, yes, I think it would be picked up
[18:14:58] <bailsman> but if a security update is pushed to focal, wouldn't the version number be 0.18.x?
[18:15:06] <rbasak> bailsman: right, but that won't happen if you "borrow" a deb from a future release.
[18:15:16] <alkisg> Example. Socat in focal is broken. I upload a new version in the greek schools ppa. Here's then my apt policy socat: https://termbin.com/7z5r9
[18:15:17] <rbasak> The security update for the Focal package will be issued at a lower version than the version you'll have installed.
[18:15:22] <bailsman> rbasak: exactly, that's the problem
[18:15:36] <alkisg> When a higher socat version becomes available in focal, it'll still reach my schools
[18:16:06] <alkisg> Since 1.2 is a requiement for TLS, any security update that includes TLS will have a higher version number
[18:16:35] <rbasak> alkisg: no it will not
[18:16:41] <bailsman> I don't expect a security update to include TLS. I imagine they would just backport the fix only and not introduce any new features. In fact, I would be angry if they included features in a security release.
[18:17:21] <rbasak> alkisg: see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdatePreparation#Update_the_packaging for what the security team typically does with package version strings in security updates.
[18:17:28] <alkisg> rbasak: I did write teh "that includes TLS" part. I doubt that will ever land in focal.
[18:17:39] <rbasak> You are making assumptions about what packagers will do with version strings that are false.

[18:18:33] <rbasak> alkisg: a security update for 1.7.3.3-2 will likely be 1.7.3.3-2ubuntu0.1 for example, or similar. That will still be less than 1.7.3.4-1.
[18:18:33] <alkisg> rbasak: if a version that included TLS landed in focal, it would be >1.2. (parenthesis, that will most probably never happen, because new releases don't generally get uploaded). Do we agree on that?

[18:19:15] <rbasak> alkisg: and thus you'd miss the security update and remain vulnerable.
[18:19:15] <bailsman> if a security issue in fact occurs the exact same thing would happen that I was worried about, that is, everyone would ignore it and I would remain vulnerable.
[18:19:19] <alkisg> rbasak: you think that a new version that was based on 1.2 upstream, could land in ubuntu with a <1.2 version number?
[18:19:36] <bailsman> I don't know if this is true about universe in general or prometheus-node-exporter in particular
[18:20:08] <rbasak> alkisg: that is possible, yes, although if the packaging really were derived from a new upstream it's more likely that it would have the newer version number. However that's not a guarantee. It's also possible that a feature is backported, in which case it wouldn't get the new upstream version number.
[18:20:36] <rbasak> alkisg: packaging version numbers - especially in stable releases - are picked on the basis of what apt will do. The truth about what it is derived from doesn't matter.
[18:20:55] <bailsman> why are we assuming that a hypothetical security update would bundle tls or update the version number? And focal repos would only get an update if 0.18 was vulnerable, not if 1.2 was. So in the end, installing a package in this way would guarantee that they do not get automatically updated.

[18:22:01] <rbasak> alkisg: in summary, you *cannot rely* on anything about package versions of future updates in stable releases. If you want to remain secure in issuing your own overriding packages, you must also maintain that override by actively following what the distribution is doing.
[18:22:35] <alkisg> Oh sure, for packages in the greek school ppa I do follow both what upstream and ubuntu does
[18:23:08] *** cipherboy1 is now known as cipherboy
[18:23:36] <bailsman> yes - I'm trying to work under the assumption that the future sysadmin of these systems is irresponsible and does not manually update all the software that is installed (which might be me). Therefore, I'm trying to offload the creation of security updates to somebody more responsible than me, say, a package maintainer. :P
[18:24:00] <rbasak> bailsman: FWIW, the Canonical Server Team maintains an LMA stack.
[18:24:08] <bailsman> The best idea so far as I to have some kind of cron job track the package from a future release, rebuild it for 20.04, and email me if the build fails.
[18:24:10] <bailsman> rbasak: what's LMA?

[18:24:29] <rbasak> I'm not sure it includes prometheus-nodexporter though
[18:24:45] <alkisg> bailsman: you can also rebuild the impish deb with a lower version number, one that will get updated if an update reaches focal
[18:25:01] <bailsman> right, but if an update does land, it would break all my installations because TLS would no longer be supported
[18:25:08] <alkisg> bailsman: but not that this update then will most probably remove the TLS support, so you need to make sure it won't leave your systems in a broken configuration
[18:25:09] <rbasak> It uses Telegraf
[18:25:10] <bailsman> at least it would alert me, which is better than having a security issue fly under the radar
[18:25:38] <rbasak> THere is a plan to put Telegraf into main
[18:25:40] <alkisg> bailsman: you can make a cron job that alerts you then. Just a check for the "current focal version"
[18:25:40] <bailsman> rbasak: interesting - any thoughts on the relative merits of Telegraf and prometheus?
[18:25:51] <alkisg> You don't need to "build packages" with cron
[18:25:58] <rbasak> I'm not sure, sorry. Try in #ubuntu-server

[19:08:58] <CyL> So, I just installed Ubuntu following this tutorial https://mutschler.eu/linux/install-guides/ubuntu-btrfs/ to get btrfs + full disk encryption. All went well, but now I'm presented with a screen stating that secure boot failed when trying to boot into the system. When ubiquity asked me to install third party drivers and updates I selected "yes", and I was presented with the UEFI "Enroll MOK" screen as usual.
[19:09:00] <CyL> I enrolled it, but I might be missing an extra step on this, specially when it comes to grub installation, since I did it manually. Would anyone help me shed some light on this issue?

[22:55:35] <h1pot> I'm unable to open the snap version of kdenlive, it gives me 'error while loading shared libraries: libKF5NotifyConfig.so.5'; i already have this library instaled, so i don't know what i can do
[22:57:47] <BinarySavior> does ubuntu overwrite /var/crash each time the same program crashes in the same way?  I'm asking because i'm not seeing a new core dump after each crash
[22:58:04] <h1pot> it also prints 'main.go:176: description of prepare-image's "<target-dir>" is lowercase in locale "pt_BR"', but I don't know if it's related
[23:00:21] <alkisg> BinarySavior: in maybe think that perhaps possibly it doesn't regenerate a new crash report, it keeps the first one
[23:00:22] <tomreyn> BinarySavior: not normally, no, but there may be some kind of rate limiting
[23:00:52] <BinarySavior> tomreyn, ulimit -c outputs 0 but it still created a coredump
