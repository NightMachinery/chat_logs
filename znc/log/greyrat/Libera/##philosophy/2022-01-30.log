[03:47:25] <ProfSimm> No one is philosophical today huh
[03:49:08] <causative> you are correct that most of what the brain does is function fitting
[03:49:48] <causative> also called adaptation
[03:50:37] <causative> each neuron adapts to the local circumstances around it, and somehow this results in a global optimization
[03:54:20] <causative> specifically, what the brain is constantly doing is forming models of what happens if it does different things, then trying things that are relatively good according to the model, and then updating the parts of the models that are most relevant to action
[03:54:46] <ProfSimm> causative: models are like folding origami out of paper.
[03:55:10] <ProfSimm> causative: except with enough neurons and connections you can fold paper millions of times in 10 thousands dimensions
[03:55:35] <causative> that's one way to think of it
[03:55:47] <ProfSimm> causative: I've seen graphs of the "problem" and "solution" spaces formed by ANN and basically that's what informed my mental model of it
[03:56:14] <ProfSimm> It's like having a polynomial expression and tweaking parameters endlessly trying to get a function shaped as you want it
[03:56:21] <ProfSimm> Signal origami :P
[03:57:00] <causative> yes
[03:57:13] <causative> that's how you update a model
[03:57:18] <ProfSimm> So then
[03:57:22] <ProfSimm> Consciosness.
[03:57:25] <ProfSimm> What is.
[03:57:27] <ProfSimm> :P
[03:57:58] <ProfSimm> I'm not a fan of the "processing network sufficiently advanced enough" type of explanations. If you dig into it, it's the same as saying "magic did it"
[03:58:06] <causative> *awareness* of consciousness is awareness of data flows within your brain - e.g. being able to talk and think about the data flows coming from your visual cortex or your auditory cortex
[03:58:16] <causative> from this we can say that the consciousness is the data flows
[03:58:55] <ProfSimm> I don't think I have a model in my head that causes self-aware data to have consciousness

[03:59:11] <causative> I didn't say it was self-aware data
[03:59:16] <ProfSimm> Well.
[03:59:18] <ProfSimm> What then
[03:59:27] <causative> you're still conscious even when you aren't practicing awareness of your own consciousness
[03:59:47] <causative> such as in zazen, where you try to eliminate higher-order thoughts and just mindfully sense
[03:59:48] <ProfSimm> OK so the question was about consciousness, the experience
[04:00:15] <causative> most people most of the time are not thinking about the fact that they are conscious; they are merely acting based on their sensory data streams
[04:00:21] <causative> but they are conscious even though they aren't self-conscious
[04:00:41] <causative> consciousness comes from data streams, not necessarily self-aware data streams
[04:01:22] <ProfSimm> OK so where does it come from. Computers have data streams. The Internet does
[04:01:28] <ProfSimm> Are we hive mind yet :P
[04:01:53] <causative> a rock has data streams, and quite complex ones at that
[04:02:06] <ProfSimm> All right. So is it conscious
[04:02:36] <causative> yes
[04:02:45] <ProfSimm> causative: how can we verify that
[04:03:03] <causative> we form a model of what consciousness is, based on our personal experience, and then see whether the rock fits the model
[04:03:35] <ProfSimm> Yes so what's our model
[04:04:17] *** Quits: kariosfox (~kariosfox@89.229.175.242) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[04:04:26] <causative> we may say that the data streams that are part of our consciousness are those that we might *potentially* think about and report on, whether we're doing so or not at any given time
[04:05:07] <stiltrumpelskin> causative, is it possible for someone to be unconscious?
[04:05:14] <causative> which is to say, that if we encounter a situation where our goals would be assisted by such self-conscious reporting, then in that case we would perform the reporting
[04:06:26] <causative> stiltrumpelskin, there are flawed assumptions in that question, first of them is the assumption that a person is a single continuous thread of awareness
[04:06:38] <stiltrumpelskin> what is awareness?
[04:06:51] <causative> subjective experience
[04:06:57] <causative> I'm not done answering your question
[04:07:05] <causative> when a person is asleep, what is in their brain is different from what is in a waking person's brain
[04:07:10] <causative> so it is a different consciousness
[04:07:16] <causative> not a waking human consciousness, but another kind
[04:07:32] <stiltrumpelskin> consciousness is a subjective experience
[04:08:06] <stiltrumpelskin> memory of experience is essential for consciousness as commonly thought of, in my opinion
[04:08:09] <causative> so it is possible for a *waking human* consciousness to go away when a person becomes unconscious, or dies
[04:08:18] <causative> it would be replaced by other structures of data flows
[04:09:03] <causative> but whether you want to still call it "their" consciousness is purely a matter of how you define their self
[04:09:16] <causative> which is arbitrary; there is no philosophically necessary definition of self
[04:09:33] <causative> only moments of consciousness at different times and places
[04:09:56] <stiltrumpelskin> i think the distinction between mine and your consciousness is easy to make isn't it?
[04:10:09] <causative> not in all thought experiments
[04:10:13] <stiltrumpelskin> you can see my brain patterns, but you don't see the subjective experience they cause
[04:10:29] <stiltrumpelskin> (or vice versa)
[04:10:29] <causative> at a particular moment, sure
[04:10:45] <causative> but over time consciousness can split or merge in such a way that we can't consistently say which is the "original"
[04:11:06] <causative> the notion of a continuous line of consciousness over time is not fully coherent, when you consider all possible thought experimetns
[04:12:21] <stiltrumpelskin> expand on conciousness splitting or merging, i dont understand what you mean
[04:13:00] <causative> imagine an amoeba dividing. Which of the two new amoebas - genetically identical to each other, and of similar size - is the original?
[04:13:21] <stiltrumpelskin>  i remember having that conversation with you, but how is it relevant here?
[04:13:57] *** Joins: plankster (~plankster@user/plankers)
[04:14:13] <causative> well, imagine instead of an amoeba dividing, it's a mind dividing, creating two identical copies in such a way that there's no natural method to favor one or the other as the original
[04:15:27] <stiltrumpelskin> do you think minds divide like that?
[04:15:34] <causative> in a thought experiment they could
[04:15:51] <causative> also in the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics
[04:16:20] <causative> for example, imagine each neuron dividing into functionally identical copies with the same connectivity, until you have the neurons for two brains in the space of one, and then separate the neurons into two brains that now function independently and identically to the original
[04:19:34] <dispersed> a greater mind can become you as well, ... the old you will just give in. we are all george
[04:20:55] <stiltrumpelskin> does that shed any light on how a rock could be considered conscious? lol
[04:21:25] <causative> no, it sheds light on how continuity of consciousness, or of the self, is not a fully consistent concept

[04:24:43] <causative> what does it matter if you call them senses or not?
[04:25:22] <stiltrumpelskin> the senses are what turn 'outside data' into 'inside data'
[04:27:35] <dispersed> in the same sense that most of space is void, most of our "life" is dead too
[04:28:02] <dispersed> most of our consciousness is sparse and intermittent, there is no actual in- or  outside
[04:28:38] <dispersed> we retain an attentional blink simply because nothing disturbs them in between
[04:28:44] <stiltrumpelskin> i disagree. i can never tell if the colors map the same for you as they do for me, for example.
[04:29:35] <stiltrumpelskin> we can only agree that we call something 'orange'. i have no idea about your subjective experience of 'orange'
[04:30:01] <dispersed> if you watch an analog clock that isn't moving, you will feel time stop, but it will feel longer.. in the same sense, when nothing is happening, you feel more "conscious"
[04:30:07] <causative> the meaning of a color in the mind is *only* how that color functions within the mind
[04:30:29] <causative> if your "orange" has the same function - takes the same place - in your mental system, as my "orange" does in mine, then they are the same orange
[04:31:54] <stiltrumpelskin> i disagree. consider the thought experiment where you swap the subjective experience of the color but retain the name.
[04:32:14] <stiltrumpelskin> so your subjective experience of orange might be my subjective experience of green.
[04:32:52] <causative> and does this "swap" have any *functional* change on either mind? do any of the atoms of the mind behave differently before or after the swap?
[04:33:10] <causative> if not, then nothing happened
[04:33:12] <causative> nothing was swapped
[04:33:32] <stiltrumpelskin> my point is that the atoms we see on the outside do not explain the experience.
[04:34:10] <causative> why not?
[04:34:19] <stiltrumpelskin> because of my thought experiment lol
[04:34:30] <causative> your thought experiment in which exactly nothing happened
[04:34:45] <stiltrumpelskin> you are discounting the notion of subjective experience entirely
[04:34:52] <causative> no
[04:34:57] *** Quits: Shashin (~Shashin@cpc112711-nmal22-2-0-cust53.19-2.cable.virginm.net) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[04:35:02] <stiltrumpelskin> then explain why my thought experiment is invalid
[04:35:13] <causative> but subjective experience is entirely dependent on how the mind functions
[04:35:42] <dispersed> this irc chat is conscious like the rock is, yet most of the time nothing is happening. only instantaneous new lines appearing
[04:35:53] <causative> the ineffable subjective "orangeness" is really a functional attribute, e.g. a certain coded vector of neuron activations that triggers functional associations within your mind
[04:36:08] <stiltrumpelskin> that is the 'outside' view
[04:36:21] <causative> if a mental object triggers those same functional associations, it's the same subjective experience
[04:36:54] <causative> "Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object."
[04:38:50] <stiltrumpelskin> let's say what you experience as 'sight' i experience as what you would call 'taste'. from the outside its possible you could never see this difference. but if you could peer into my mind, you would see it.
[04:39:27] <causative> what does it *mean* to say you experience it as "taste"?
[04:39:43] <stiltrumpelskin> it means instead of mapping data into colors, it maps the data into tastes
[04:40:05] <causative> but these "tastes" function exactly the same as "colors" - you think of them in the same way, make the same associations
[04:40:14] <causative> in what way are they "tastes" then?
[04:40:18] <stiltrumpelskin> but its not the same experience!
[04:40:30] <causative> the associations are what *make* it an experience, and they are the same associations
[04:40:45] <stiltrumpelskin> no, there is something extra that makes an experience
[04:41:09] <stiltrumpelskin> i cant say what you are experiencing even if i know what all your neurons are doing
[04:41:36] <causative> your brain is saying "no, there is something extra that makes an experience."  This is a functional, empirical, observable thing your brain is doing. Why is it doing that?
[04:41:52] <stiltrumpelskin> experience is not an observable thing
[04:42:07] <causative> I wasn't talking about experience, I was talking about your utterance
[04:42:11] <causative> that's an observable thing
[04:42:19] <causative> and there's some *cause* within your brain, a physical cause, that is making it say "no, there is something extra that makes an experience."
[04:42:19] <stiltrumpelskin> at least, not my experience to you, or yours to mine
[04:42:25] <stiltrumpelskin> sure.
[04:42:44] <dispersed> an experience is just a static configuration, like a letter on the screen
[04:42:45] <stiltrumpelskin> i uttered that to try to explain my point to you lol
[04:43:03] <dispersed> an experience can be the same only if the totality of all configuration is the same
[04:43:06] <causative> and there's also a mental cause, something in your mind that is making you say it - a parallel explanation of why you said it
[04:43:15] <causative> and they are the same, i.e. we must identify the physical cause with the mental case
[04:43:16] <causative> *cause
[04:43:31] <dispersed> which is to say, a letter 'a' in a book appears very different depending on the book it is in
[04:43:46] <causative> to do otherwise would be to suppose your mind operates independently of your brain, which is only mysticism
[04:44:02] <stiltrumpelskin> i think my mind influences my brain, and vice versa
[04:44:22] <causative> well, that's something empirically testable, stiltrumpelskin
[04:44:56] <stiltrumpelskin> i agree. but 'experience' is something that is not empirically testable.
[04:45:01] <causative> if there is actual influence of the mind upon the brain - the mind being a separate thing, not wholly dependent on the brain - then if, in the distant future, we could model the whole brain, we would find a missing element
[04:45:20] <causative> we would find that our model falls short, because it fails to include what the mind is doing to influence the brain
[04:45:26] <causative> so you are making an empirical claim
[04:45:32] <stiltrumpelskin> sure.
[04:45:33] <causative> one that lacks any empirical support
[04:45:56] <stiltrumpelskin> i think its consistent with all empirical data
[04:46:01] <causative> *in theory* it is testable, with observable results; *in fact* it has not been tested. No experiment supports your notion.
[04:46:23] <stiltrumpelskin> how about the experience of 'free will'
[04:46:38] <stiltrumpelskin> that is entirely consistent with our physical theories
[04:46:40] <causative> simply for it to be consistent is not enough; Occam's razor would say to eliminate a hypothesis for which we don't have evidence
[04:46:57] <stiltrumpelskin> the evidence is my experience lol
[04:47:04] <causative> you don't have an experience of "free will"
[04:47:22] <stiltrumpelskin> i certainly do. i can decide on options that are presented to me.
[04:47:36] <causative> so can a self-driving car
[04:47:41] <causative> or a potato sorting machine
[04:47:51] *** Quits: ProfSimm (~ProfSimm@87.227.196.109) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:48:38] <causative> the potato sorting machine uses a camera to look at each potato falling past it, and decides if it looks like a bad potato, and if it is, the machine activates a flipper that knocks the potato off to a reject bin
[04:48:44] <causative> that's as much of a choice as what you do
[04:48:47] <stiltrumpelskin> in that case they might have free will. if their choices are not determined by the phyical data
[04:49:05] <causative> their choices are fully determined by the physical data, as are yours
[04:49:11] <stiltrumpelskin> how do you know that?
[04:49:24] <causative> that's what the science points to
[04:49:32] <stiltrumpelskin> i disagree.
[04:49:39] <causative> and also, as you understand psychology, you understand that people don't do things for just no reason
[04:49:42] <causative> there's always a reason
[04:49:51] <causative> always a cause, mentally, for why you did X instead of Y
[04:50:29] <causative> and if, hypothetically, you acted randomly - without cause - that wouldn't even be good! You wouldn't like it! Because if you're acting without cause, it means you aren't acting in a way that gets you what you want.
[04:50:36] <stiltrumpelskin> there is a cause, but not necessarily a physical cause
[04:50:50] <causative> well now you're just being circular
[04:50:57] <stiltrumpelskin> why do you say that?
[04:51:45] <causative> you're saying "The mind has non-physical parts, because I can experience them directly via free will, which is not explainable as physical brain function because the mind has non-physical parts."
[04:52:57] <stiltrumpelskin> i dont claim that i can explain free will. i'm just saying its consistent with our physical theories,
[04:53:13] <causative> yes, but you have no *evidence* for it
[04:53:33] <causative> so Occam's razor says to get rid of unnecessary hypotheses
[04:53:56] <stiltrumpelskin> i dont have 'outside' evidence that i can point you to, that's correct
[04:54:14] <causative> the mind being physically based is also fully consistent with our physical theories, and Occam's razor favors that idea over yours
[04:54:57] <stiltrumpelskin> the physical theories are far from explaining all of our experience.
[04:55:25] <stiltrumpelskin> as for occam's razor, that's a judgement call
[04:55:30] <causative> not in detail, no; but your notion of an external mind adds nothing to the explanation
[04:55:40] <causative> Occam's razor is one of the most fundamental principles in science
[04:55:50] <stiltrumpelskin> i think it helps explain my inner world better
[04:55:54] <causative> you can build a theoretical superhuman AI based on nothing but Occam's razor and process of elimination
[04:56:13] <causative> called AIXI, by Marcus Hutter
[04:56:35] <stiltrumpelskin> occam's razor is a judgement call because there are things i consider important for answering this question that you do not

[11:41:03] <mycroftiv> almost, for me
[11:41:20] <mycroftiv> a nice time to offer greetings to the Dawn
[11:41:48] <arryana> i knew a lot of hippies who did that sort of thing
[11:42:03] <mycroftiv> i am aware of many
[11:45:07] <Lumine> Morning
[11:53:01] <mycroftiv> lumine: good morning, thank you for your work with color
[11:53:13] <Lumine> What?
[11:53:48] <mycroftiv> i know you are an artist and perhaps i was assuming too quickly that you use color in your works
[11:54:02] <Lumine> Oh right
[11:54:09] <Lumine> I just thought I might've missed something
[11:54:22] <mycroftiv> just a simple thank you for working to create beauty :)
[11:54:35] <arryana> heya, lumi
[11:54:38] <arryana> what's the good work
[11:54:41] <arryana> word
[11:54:42] <Lumine> Well you're welcome
[11:55:04] <Lumine> Well I wrote a new chapter for one of my stories last night
[11:55:31] <Lumine> And the seventh Cosmos piece is halfway there
[11:57:04] <arryana> excellent
[11:57:21] <mycroftiv> sounds really nice. im looking forward to a combination of creativity and relaxation as much as possible i think from now on
[11:57:32] <mycroftiv> and eternal learning :)
[11:59:41] <arryana> i was hoping to finish knitting this coat before i had to leave for the states, but i don't think it's gonna happen
[12:00:18] <Lumine> Aww, hope it gets to see the light of day soon
[12:00:25] <arryana> well.
[12:00:56] <arryana> my mom's hospice nurse called with the 'get here as fast as you can' thing, so unless i finish it in the next week or so, it's going to have to wait for the end of march
[12:01:15] <Lumine> Oh
[12:03:42] <arryana> at this point she wants it over as much as any of us.  hopefully it'll go quickly for her

[12:37:19] <Lumine> I had a complaint the other day about the "shock culture". Not culture shock, but the way in which we exaggerate our language to make a quick impact and get a reaction out of people. Everything is now "amazing" and "shocking", when they're nothing of the kind. We say someone is a "genius" simply because they found their glasses or something to that effect. And I think it's making mockery of the terms that used to mean something.
[12:39:40] <arryana> it's hysterical hyerbole

[12:50:59] <Lumine> So that when I had a conversation with a friend recently, they started by saying "Okay, you won't believe what happened to me yesterday!" And then proceeded to describe a series of events I wasn't even remotely interested in. They had nothing to do with the opening suggestion.

[18:26:28] <ProfSimm> iryith: 2) you believe the sun rises from the west
[18:26:34] <ProfSimm> iryith: 3) it does
[18:26:45] <ProfSimm> What does that mean about the universe you live in
[18:27:02] <arryana> it isn't ever going to happen, so, pointless question
[18:27:03] <iryith> your nomenclature of what you believe the direction of the sun rising has no influence over the objective fact of the direction of the sun rising
[18:27:26] <iryith> you can call the direction Steve, it still rises from the same direction
[18:27:26] <ProfSimm> iryith: are you sure?
[18:27:29] <iryith> yes
[18:27:33] <arryana> of course.
[18:27:48] <iryith> what you call it has no impact
[18:27:52] <arryana> anyone who thinks they see the sun rising in the west because they want it to needs to check themselves into a mental hospital
[18:27:55] <ProfSimm> I think you both misunderstand the case here. The case is that the Sun rises from the opposite direction
[18:28:02] <iryith> it doesn't
[18:28:07] <arryana> it won't.

[18:30:30] <arryana> pointless question
[18:30:32] <iryith> I can change the laws of physics by thinking about it, everything falls to pieces because everything is interconnected

[18:31:09] <ProfSimm> I'll take this as "I deny my observations and decide I'm crazy"
[18:31:14] <iryith> You reverse the direction of orbit of the planet, the resulting stop and start in a new direction destroys everything on the planet as well as yourself
[18:31:18] <ProfSimm> As your answer to my question
[18:31:51] <iryith> no, the answer to your question is "in the real world that's not how things work" and if you wanted a hypothetical it would be "everything would be destroyed if I can change physics at a whim"
[18:32:26] <ProfSimm> iryith: did general relativity destroy physics? It did contradict earlier laws in some cases.

[18:35:18] <iryith> 1/10
[18:35:57] <ProfSimm> If you had precise watches enough they'll go out of sync the moment you keep them at different height
[18:36:29] <ProfSimm> Reality as you perceive it, and reality as it is are two very sparsely connected things.
[18:36:51] <iryith> so you are talking about relativity then?
[18:37:06] <iryith> which absolutely is impacted by the height relative to something else
[18:37:16] <iryith> which is why GPS satellites have to compensate for it
[18:38:18] <ProfSimm> When said satellites were launched, they contained logic to compensate for relativity or not compensate for it, because the military leadership thought the scientists that warned them about time dilation are bunch of idiots.

[19:01:22] <srukle> When isn't an ideology crazy?
[19:01:30] <ProfSimm> Both camps describe each other as "living on different planets" and technically that's true, because we live in the world we project in our mind.
[19:02:22] <ProfSimm> srukle: crazy is relative. If it becomes the norm, the same ideology becomes normal, by definition
[19:03:13] <ProfSimm> srukle: there are two types of ideological mismatches. One is "tribe to tribe" where it's essentially ideological war between tribes. The other is an ideology that's extremely maladaptive to reality itself.
[19:03:53] *** Joins: f1se4 (~f1se4@213.195.113.45)
[19:03:57] <ProfSimm> But things like what we discuss whether to 'hate gays' or not, are not in themselves maladaptive to reality. We have countries that suppress women, suppress different sexual orientations and so on, and somehow find a balance.
[19:04:09] <ProfSimm> At the cost of suffering, but apparently not sufficient to destroy that ideology
[19:04:24] <srukle> Do you think ideology is essential for social organization?
[19:05:05] <ProfSimm> We need to align ideologically let's say (random number) 90% so we can work as society, and 10% is left for the "foamy surface" where new ideas can battle and evolve so we grow as society
[19:05:34] <srukle> Alright, I see. Didn't mean to derail the conversation.
[19:05:41] <ProfSimm> Being kinda wrong together is often better for survival than being individually super-super-correct
[19:05:54] <ProfSimm> It's paradoxical.
[19:06:02] <srukle> I agree it's a paradox.
[19:06:12] <ProfSimm> To our mindset. We tend to think being right is the only thing that matters.
[19:06:36] <ProfSimm> But network effects and cooperation are critical for parts to work together.
[19:06:55] <ProfSimm> I.e. it's better to have a shitty car that works, than the parts of a perfect car that don't fit together
[19:08:17] <ProfSimm> This explains why we have instincts to fall behind a leader, to be religious and so on. Well it's one reason among many I bet.
[19:09:45] <ProfSimm> It's like a James Gunn movie. Bunch of flawed, shitty people come together, learn to work together, and become a team, and a family unit.

[23:10:28] <ProfSimm> Delf, emotions are related to belief but aren't belief
[23:10:30] <yanmaani> specifically, as described in note 4 to chapter 7 of Open Society and its Enemies
[23:10:53] <yanmaani> Is the argument that he is making utilitarian or deontological?
[23:11:34] <Delf> Yes, ProfSimm, emotions aren't belief. But there is an interaction between them
[23:11:46] <yanmaani> Specifically, does it allow for the punishment of innocent people, if such is necessary for the perseverance of the system, qua the avoidance of the assertion of the right to revolution?
[23:12:16] <yanmaani> Or is it only allow for the punishment of people who 'deserve' it? In that case, what is the relationship between the conclusion and the premise?
[23:12:47] <yanmaani> I can give a more specific example if you want

[23:13:36] <ProfSimm> yanmaani: most paradoxes in logic and philosophy actually stem from elementary flaws of the models we use to think about the paradoxes that cause infinities. And infinites are undefined.
[23:13:59] <ProfSimm> yanmaani: self-reference also causes infinities. In this case defining "tolerance towards the intolerant" is self-referential
[23:14:00] <yanmaani> ProfSimm: How does this relate to Popper's paradox of intolerance?
[23:14:32] <yanmaani> Surely it ... does not?

[23:15:47] <ProfSimm> yanmaani: I didn't say every self-reference causes a paradox, I just said paradoxes stem from those properties of how we think about things.

[23:16:56] <ProfSimm> yanmaani: "tolerance" is itself a non-sense construct. Tolerance means you're in adversarial relationship with something/someone, but you make a specific decision not to take action.

[23:17:16] <yanmaani> wherein lies the nonsense?
[23:17:20] <ProfSimm> yanmaani: I know tolerance is a modern word to use in these conversations about discrimination and so on, but it's kinda nonsense
[23:17:38] <yanmaani> this was written in 1944 or thereabouts
[23:17:42] <ProfSimm> yanmaani: well is this the society you want. Which has adversarial relationship to each other but have decided to take no action
[23:17:49] <yanmaani> ???
[23:17:56] <yanmaani> I'm not asking about the implications of tolerance etc
[23:17:56] <Bakunin> Popper actually refers to "tolerance"
[23:18:03] <yanmaani> I have a specific question about the paradox of tolerance
[23:18:11] <yanmaani> is it a deontological or utilitarian argument
[23:18:48] <yanmaani> then, (1), if it is utilitarian, is there any reason as for why it would be bad to murder innocent people
[23:18:56] <Bakunin> its utilitarian
[23:19:10] <Bakunin> the deontology is "always kill nazis"
[23:19:11] <yanmaani> and, (2), if it is deontological, how does it relate to the premise
[23:19:12] <ProfSimm> yanmaani: we can redefine the problem not as in "we want to be tolerant or intolerant' but "what traits we permit in our society as productive and which we don't permit as detrimental" and suddenly the paradox goes poof.
[23:19:34] <yanmaani> Bakunin: Right, so my question is if this only applies to Nazis.
[23:20:00] <Bakunin> bigots of certain types
[23:20:04] <Bakunin> "nazi" is the catchall
[23:20:29] <yanmaani> Well, sure, but it seems like a logical conclusion to not only kill (1) Nazis, but also (2) people who argue that Nazis should have free speech, (3) people who do not believe Nazis should have free speech, but people who believe that (2) should have free speech
[23:20:41] <yanmaani> (4) people who do not believe that (2) should, but that (3) should
[23:20:43] <yanmaani> &
[23:20:46] <Bakunin> would be hard to disambiguate... nazis would have killed all the Turks, Africans, southeast asians, etc, but those groups also have bigots who kill for eugenics, too
[23:20:46] <yanmaani> &c
[23:20:58] <yanmaani> there is an "infinite regress of intolerances," if you will
[23:21:08] <yanmaani> If the argument is purely utilitarian, that is.
[23:21:12] <Bakunin> there really isn't

[23:22:42] <yanmaani> Bakunin: Yes, that obviously sucks. But if it's a utilitarian argument, do the limitations on speech stop at Nazis?
[23:23:02] <yanmaani> Because it seems to me like it would stop at "anyone who could be beneficial to Nazis," which is a somewhat wider group
[23:23:08] <Bakunin> political terrorism
[23:23:17] <Bakunin> fascism is one form of bigoted political terrorism
[23:23:32] <yanmaani> Right. But what about people who aren't fascists, but who make apologetics for fascism?
[23:23:40] <ProfSimm> yanmaani: speech doesn't require sharp boundaries between a group you tolerate and one you don't. You choose to define it this way
[23:23:41] <Bakunin> those are fascists
[23:24:08] <yanmaani> What about people who aren't fascist apologetics, who don't make apologetics for fascism, but who make apologetics for fascism apologetics?
[23:24:38] <Bakunin> give an example
[23:24:43] <yanmaani> "those are fascists" - in their own minds, e.g. deontologically? or from the point of view on "effect on society", e.g. from the utilitarian sense
[23:24:46] <yanmaani> OK, so

[23:29:29] <Bakunin> yeah if nazi speech is banned, and he's campaigning for nazi speech to be unbanned, he's violating the state
[23:29:30] <yanmaani> "defending hate speech", "undermining the stability of society," etc
[23:29:46] <yanmaani> Bakunin: OK, sure. So let's say there's a third guy

[23:29:53] * ProfSimm groans
[23:30:01] <yanmaani> doesn't believe nazi speech should be unbanned
[23:30:12] <yanmaani> but he does belive lawyer #2 shouldn't be charged with anything
[23:30:15] <yanmaani> is he violating the state?
[23:30:16] <Bakunin> if nazi speech is legal, nothing happens to anyone
[23:30:31] <yanmaani> I mean in Popper's ideal society, where nazi speech is banned.
[23:30:42] <Bakunin> yanmaani that person is confused, and is the same as #2
[23:30:53] <Bakunin> 1.  The cult of tradition. “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.”
[23:31:00] <Bakunin> 2.  The rejection of modernism. “The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.”
[23:31:06] <Bakunin> 3.  The cult of action for action’s sake. “Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.”
[23:31:10] <yanmaani> So if there is a person #4 then, the same arugment goes?
[23:31:16] <Bakunin> 4.  Disagreement is treason. “The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.”
[23:31:17] <yanmaani> and so on, for an infinite regress of persons?
[23:31:26] <Bakunin> 5.  Fear of difference. “The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.”
[23:31:30] <yanmaani> If there is a, like, guy #3999
[23:31:36] <Bakunin> 6.  Appeal to social frustration. “One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.”
[23:31:48] <Bakunin> 7.  The obsession with a plot. “Thus at the root of the Ur-Fascist psychology there is the obsession with a plot, possibly an international one. The followers must feel besieged.”
[23:31:58] <Bakunin> 8.  The enemy is both strong and weak. “By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.”
[23:32:12] <Bakunin> 9.  Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. “For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.”
[23:32:12] <yanmaani> who thinks that the 3997 guys behind him should all be shot, but that guy #3998 is pretty cool
[23:32:25] <Bakunin> 10.  Contempt for the weak. “Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.”
[23:32:39] <Bakunin> 11.  Everybody is educated to become a hero. “In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.”

[23:32:54] <Bakunin> 12.  Machismo and weaponry. “Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.”
[23:33:00] <yanmaani> ProfSimm: please try to stay on topic
[23:33:12] <Bakunin> 13.  Selective populism. “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.”
[23:33:14] <ProfSimm> yanmaani: I am, but you prefer to stay confused
[23:33:31] <Bakunin> and finally 14.  Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.”

[23:35:48] <ProfSimm> I think boolean thinking should be defined as 'fascism'
[23:35:57] <yanmaani> Bakunin: Yes, but what of campaigning to legalize the act of advocating to legalize the advocacy of it, separately from advocating to legalize IT?
[23:36:05] <Bakunin> Nobody who is not fascist needs the freedom to be fascist

[23:52:58] <ProfSimm> Bottom line, you can't win, if you disagree with Bakunin you're a fascist
[23:53:03] <Bakunin> he shows up near me, I kill him
[23:53:17] <Bakunin> because I'm - wait for it - not a fascist
[23:53:22] <yanmaani> You, uh, kill a guy because he sat next to a guy at a table?
[23:53:43] <Bakunin> no, because he's a brownshirt as mentioned
[23:53:47] <Bakunin> that was a premise
[23:53:54] <yanmaani> Was the 'yes' in reference to srukle or to the 10th guy?
[23:54:09] <Bakunin> the nazi
[23:54:32] <yanmaani> Okay, so let's say this normal-looking guy (nazi) sits at a table with 9 other people.
[23:54:36] <yanmaani> Are they too Nazis?
[23:54:46] <yanmaani> because they sat at the same table as a nazi, no?

[23:55:09] <Bakunin> yanmaani yes this is a well known trope from WWII
[23:55:34] <Bakunin> you're having a real hard time reasoning why something must be suppressed because it's so bad
[23:55:43] <ProfSimm> Resolution to Popper's Intolerance Paradox: kill everyone in case they're a fascist, it means no more fascist left as you're by yourself. QED
[23:55:49] *** Joins: Atque (~Atque@user/atque)
[23:55:52] <yanmaani> No, I'm asking a specific question about Popper's argument
[23:56:06] <yanmaani> The suppression, then, is on an utilitarian basis?
[23:56:19] <yanmaani> Am I right then in assuming that you can also suppress good-intentioned people?
[23:56:27] <Bakunin> no
[23:56:30] <yanmaani> Who genuinely don't wish to harm anyone
[23:56:42] <Bakunin> you're strugging to find good intentions anywhere around meta-fascism
[23:56:46] <Bakunin> you'll grow out of that.
[23:56:48] <yanmaani> Wait, so take my friend Alice*. I think she's pretty sincere, at least.
[23:57:05] <Bakunin> wishing for fascist speech is literally wishing for harm.
[23:57:07] <ProfSimm> Every filter has false positives / false negatives. To claim your filter is perfect is the best way to get a lot of those false positives.
[23:57:20] <yanmaani> Member of a normal leftist party, not into Roman salutes, you know, the usual stuff.
[23:57:21] <Bakunin> And with that, I think I've explained it and repeated it several times.
[23:57:49] <yanmaani> Are you saying that she's good-intentioned, but ought to be punished still?
[23:57:59] <yanmaani> That she ought to be suppressed, but that it isn't a punishment?
[23:58:07] <yanmaani> Or that it's impossible for her to be good-intentioned?
[23:58:54] <srukle> What is Alice's crime?
[23:59:14] <yanmaani> srukle: Thinking that Mike should have the ability to express his opinion freely
[23:59:29] <srukle> She merely thinks this or advocates it to a certain extent?
[23:59:33] <yanmaani> (Mike in turn thinks that Glenn Greenwald should have the ability to express his opinion freely)
[23:59:57] <ProfSimm> srukle: you're walking through a minefield, you'll be fascist in 3, 2, 1...
