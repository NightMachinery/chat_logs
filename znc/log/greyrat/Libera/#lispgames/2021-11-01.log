[00:27:36] <dto> hey |3b| and borodust 
[00:28:44] <|3b|> 'lo
[00:50:45] <dto> borodust: you might find my article for ECL news regarding android builds relevant, when linking against something for the wrong architecture etc
[00:50:46] <dto> https://common-lisp.net/project/ecl/posts/ECL-Quarterly-Volume-IV.html
[00:52:15] <dto> although what i describe doing with ASDF is nonstandard and probably not the use case you were describing anyway. but I do remember having to pull GLES-foo.so off of some android device and using some trick to link against it during cross compilation
[01:05:44] <borodust> hi dto 
[01:05:55] <borodust> dto: i'm using lispworks
[01:06:22] <borodust> i mean, not exactly using, just evaluating ;p
[01:06:29] <dto> ok but some of the things involved were not ECL specific, maybe the article would be helpful
[01:07:10] <borodust> yup, i already run alien-works on android using, but thanks anyway!
[01:07:15] <dto> ok! :)
[01:07:18] <borodust> *using ECL
[01:07:41] <borodust> EQL5 author has useful scripts around too
[01:08:12] <borodust> ECL is super slow if going with its bytecode interpreter
[01:08:22] <dto> i'd really like to use alien-works at some point, but right now i've just fallen back on using my existing game engine/libs. 
[01:08:53] <borodust> for its compiler to work, arm emulation required
[01:09:26] <borodust> ECL bytecode interpreter is a no-go for me, cuz loading my GLM bindings takes ~8 minutes on my android device ;p
[01:10:00] <borodust> this is due to bytecode interpretation during loading phase
[01:10:07] <borodust> and GLM bindings are huge
[01:10:30] <dto> ah.
[01:10:50] <borodust> lispworks, on the other hand, uses image dumping for android too, so loading that image is almost instant
[01:11:13] <borodust> on actual android device, i mean
[01:11:31] <dto> one of the things i look forward to on the Atari VCS 800 is that it's not Android
[01:11:34] <dto> :)
[01:11:43] <dto> happy halloween borodust !
[01:12:21] <borodust> yay! although we don't really have it around my place ;p
[01:12:42] <dto> :)
[01:12:52] <dto> well i'm wishing it because I"M celebrating :)
[01:13:00] <dto> how goes game dev? 
[01:13:32] <borodust> steadily progressing, just need to finish this android delivery process..
[01:13:45] <borodust> like 95% done :D
[01:13:51] <dto> i'm trying to think up ways to spice up my game graphically without distracting the viewer. and i think that would be to improve the look of my sparkles/glows and maybe change the background more.
[01:13:55] <dto> hey good to hear!
[01:49:01] <borodust> i'm interested what new atari thing can do
[01:49:22] <borodust> *too
[01:49:38] <borodust> might be an interesting thing to get alien-works on 
[02:12:29] <dto> borodust: yeah i've heard it's a quite decent system 
[02:12:53] <dto> borodust i implemented my "arcade game phosphor glow"! https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/aHHTdUFu/Screenshot%20at%202021-10-31%2018-42-07.png https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/sNUXxOnA/Screenshot%20at%202021-10-31%2018-41-45.png

[17:14:58] <|3b|> borodust: probably do the same thing in library-glesv2.lisp (and possibly use cl-opengl/es2 system in your code for android, though not sure it matters much aside from maybe saving a bit of memory)

[21:46:49] <Icefoz> Darn it, I need to figure out how to make cool swoopy patterns for enemies in my game.
[21:47:31] <Icefoz> I really should just define a position as a function of time and have them run on rails, but it Feels Wrong to not have real acceleration and such.
[21:56:32] <technomancy> Icefoz: yeah I always go back and forth on that but the appeal of the mathematical approach is really something
[21:57:45] <dthompson> the difficulty with the position as a function of time approach is having to deal with complicated piecewise functions to model anything complicated
[21:58:05] <dthompson> overuse of "complicated" there but hopefully you get what I mean
[21:58:18] <Icefoz> right now I have a list of waypoints it walks down and a simple velocity controller that outputs an acceleration each update.
[21:58:43] <technomancy> dthompson: I was using it in the context of orbits
[21:58:46] <dthompson> I have tried several approaches and I always come back to using simple velocities
[21:59:00] <dthompson> and writing scripts to manipulate the scripts
[21:59:10] <dthompson> yeah there might be some situations where it works out just fine
[21:59:10] <technomancy> being able to model orbits using keplerian equations is also way more efficient than trying to solve the N-body problem =D
[21:59:11] <Icefoz> which I'm sure will work great once I make it actually hit the waypoints and not orbit around them.
[21:59:41] <dthompson> especially if you are trying to follow some physical laws or something
[21:59:46] <Icefoz> I had a universe sim project that did Keplerian orbits once upon a time.  They can't do so many of the cool insane things though.  ;_;
[21:59:53] <dthompson> as opposed to generalized object scripting
[22:02:23] <Icefoz> Lagrange points, close-sized binary planets/stars, braided orbits...  ;_;
