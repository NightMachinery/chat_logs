[03:08:36] <RandomReader> I would recommend making it    std::array<B, 2> member;
[03:08:44] <RandomReader> since that makes the ensuring syntax easier to reason about
[03:09:09] <RandomReader> const std::array<B, 2>& get_Bs() { return member; }
[03:09:26] <RandomReader> now the caller has a reference-to-const, which means they can look but not modify
[03:10:04] <seninha> here's my .cpp: https://0x0.st/-7Rn.cpp
[03:10:26] <RandomReader> whether A stores B objects or pointers-to-B-objects is an entirely separate question
[03:10:37] <seninha> I'm new to C++, but I know C and OOP (from Java).
[03:12:02] <seninha> I'm creating an implementation of a JezzBall/KBounce game. The Wall represents an element that will be placed at a position x,y. From this place two WallExtensions will be created and will be extended at each frame.
[03:12:11] <seninha> RandomReader: thanks, I'll use that.
[03:12:39] <seninha> Can you check my .cpp file? That's the first (big) project I do in C++.

[03:18:23] <RandomReader> the code itself looks okay, but from a design standpoint the WallExtension seems to have a bit of an identity crisis
[03:18:47] <RandomReader> probably due to the terminology overlap between physics and C++
[03:19:30] <RandomReader> so first, there seems to be no reason for new/delete in this code, just store the WallExtensions directly, no pointers

[03:21:01] <RandomReader> but it's also a bit weird for a WallExtension to be in an unfinished, it almost looks like Wall's concern
[03:21:34] <RandomReader> will other code call get_Bs() and check .isconstructed() as part of normal use?
[03:21:52] <RandomReader> as in, that's not a problem, that's just normal use and it does different things based on the outcome?
[03:22:32] <seninha> Have you played jezzball (for windows) or KBounce (for KDE)?
[03:23:22] <RandomReader> hmm, no I haven't, which is odd because I definitely played with the Windows Entertainment Pack way back...

[03:24:54] <seninha> Like, after the user place a wall in the board, two extensions will extend from this point in two opposite directions. When a WallExtension hits something, this wall extension will be in the constructed state and will not be extended anymore.
[03:25:13] <seninha> And a Wall will be constructed when both its extensions are in the constructed state.
[03:25:35] <seninha> The code that uses Wall will be responsible to check whether a collision happens.

[03:26:03] <seninha> btw, if you have java you can understand better what I'm trying to implement: https://github.com/phillbush/jbounce
[03:26:45] <seninha> I implemented this very game for my OOP classes in the uni in Java.
[03:27:01] <seninha> And now I want to reimplement it in C++, using C++ features.
[03:27:18] <RandomReader> ok
[03:28:14] <RandomReader> would have to think about this more (and probably actually implement it myself to figure it out), but what's making me pause is essentially encapsulation / separation of concerns
[03:28:30] <RandomReader> it seems more like a WallExtension is actually just a piece of Wall's state, not an independent object
[03:28:38] <seninha> I see
[03:28:56] <RandomReader> it's ok to separate it, there are two of them so having a type for that data is fine of course
[03:29:23] <RandomReader> but it's almost like *just* data for Wall to operate on, instead of something that needs behavior to be private
[03:29:41] <RandomReader> but again I'd have to think about it more to see how I might organize it
[03:29:47] <RandomReader> other than that pause/feeling, it seems fine
[03:29:58] <seninha> I think you're right.

[07:56:37] <fluter> i wanna read about everything template, partial sepcialization, etc
[07:56:41] <RandomReader> it *is* an introductory book .. full coverage of just templates and related programming techniques would be a few hundred pages, there are other books for that

[23:45:34] <anddam> hello, I am reading a the code for a logger class and I see roughly this https://gist.github.com/anddam/5bb3b322f74a13ff8d809ba01f745a63
[23:46:54] <anddam> I have a bit of familiarity with C but not C++, the Logger::m_Instance is assigned 0 outside the class definition because it's a static attribute, right?
[23:47:09] <anddam> is it correct for it to be 0 rather than NULL?
[23:47:14] *** Joins: hsiktas[m] (~hsiktasma@2001:470:69fc:105::30d4)
[23:47:50] <anyone> 0 is the old fashioned way

[23:48:20] <anyone> you can tell it's terrible code by the throw() thing
[23:48:48] <SuperNintendoSUX> static data members need to be initialized in a translation unit
[23:48:54] <anddam> I wasn't even able to find what that mean, I only found reference to the (self-explanatory) try catch, with the throw to raise an exception
[23:49:00] <SuperNintendoSUX> and I would use nullptr instead of 0

[23:49:08] <SuperNintendoSUX> like line 4 is doing
[23:49:15] *** Joins: lkor (~lionkor@beammp/staff/lionkor)
[23:49:22] <anddam> I figure that means if an exception occurs in the function… then throw nothing?
[23:49:33] <SuperNintendoSUX> this is just a silly example of scott meyers's singleton

[23:49:40] <anddam> SuperNintendoSUX: have to look for "translation unit"

[23:49:56] <SuperNintendoSUX> roughly they are cpp files

[23:50:14] <SuperNintendoSUX> in practice, TUs are what are translated into object files to be linked later
[23:50:53] <anddam> yep, just found a reference to the standard
[23:51:04] <anddam> the TU would include the header file in this case
[23:51:41] <anddam> SuperNintendoSUX: and that cannot be inited inside the class definition?
[23:51:48] <SuperNintendoSUX> there are some exceptions about what I said regarding initialization. you can check them here https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/static
[23:52:00] <SuperNintendoSUX> short answer: sometimes they can
[23:52:35] <anddam> e.g. putthing a     Logger* m_Instance = nullptr;   at L6?
[23:53:18] <anddam> s/tthi/tti/
[23:53:45] <SuperNintendoSUX> better read the page I sent. it covers all the cases
[23:55:20] <anddam> reading now, thanks
