[03:17:26] <Jong> Suppose you made a logger.   User can specify the logger file via cli argument.   Would you make the logger work even when an argument isn't specified? or would you rather wrap each logger call around an if statement like this?  if args.logger is not None:
[03:19:04] <Jong> Is there a name for this debate? I have several memories of situations in which I thought "should I get this thing to work with unhappy cases? or put if statements checks blocks the unhappy case? or throw an exception on the unhappy case?
[03:20:07] <pulse> weird way to phrase a question, but typically you don't waste user's diskspace unless explicitly requested
[03:20:41] <pulse> also you seem to be mixing conceptual features and implementation. separate those

[03:50:42] <PlanckWalk> Not necessarily.  There's lots of way to do it, that's one.

[08:26:15] <PlanckWalk> pavonia: I was answering the question "Would SHA256'ing the user's ID with a fixed salt be more secure?" (than a UUID)
[08:26:22] *** Joins: dodocrypto (~dodocrypt@user/dodocrypto)
[08:26:40] <nitrix> In the last approach that was proposed, it's a SHA256 of a salt and the user. If you happen to know the salt, you can directly target a user of your choice, generate the SHA256, trigger a password reset, use the SHA256 and take control of the account.

[08:27:23] <PlanckWalk> I suppose you could generate a UUID, *and* use a salt, *and* the username, and hash those all together.
[08:27:24] <pavonia> Okay, I thought they meant UUID + salt + SHA
[08:29:16] <nitrix> It's only safer if you can protect the salt. UUID has quite poor avalanche characteristics and less entropy to work with (128-bits). Not to mention that depending on the UUID version, some sections are very trivial to predict.

[12:20:45] <arahael> That's right, it would typically take people _decades_ to ascend, without spoilers.
[12:22:02] <^-^hi> francogrex: github is a website everyone can put code on.
[12:22:09] <^-^hi> good code, bad code.
[12:22:43] <arahael> And since it's public by default, even temporary code you don't particularly want others to look at.
[12:22:43] <francogrex> yes I know but is the current bad trend  because new programming language have allowed non-core programmers to start dabbling in making programs?
[12:23:14] <francogrex> most of the code is python, because it has made it easy for non computer scientists to write code
[12:23:34] <^-^hi> back in the old days now-hard-core people did write bad code in C, Fortran etc.

[15:43:26] <davros> yeah by gl i really mean a variation of it.. GLES, webgl
[15:44:00] <davros> at some point in the past i had an early gl demo running in a webpage, using a GL subset
[15:44:23] <davros> i hadn't bothered with emscripten since and advanced the codebase and features alot
[15:44:38] <davros> today someone has come along asking me to port it to the web
[15:44:48] <davros> in theory it should work,  in practice..
[15:45:12] <davros> one complication is it's written in rust, but using C-like GL bindings
[15:45:44] <davros> like I say I had those running in a web-page before, in a very early version . infact emscripten provided support for desktop imeediate mode drawing which i had used for debug
[15:46:28] <davros> that was all working using the c-like API  eg  they added glBegin , glEnd etc emulation .. and i was calling that through rust, along with the propper buffer based rendering
[15:46:55] <davros> but im struggling to compile this today , and i dont have the appetite to go and rework my entire program
[15:47:14] <davros> seems the rust community prefers rustic renames of the GL api
[15:48:18] <davros> to me jumping back and forth between C++ and Rust , I actually find those renames really, really annoying, e.g. "glDrawElements" already has a name which you'll find in docs and sample code, and it's utterly pointles to change it to gl::draw_elements or whatever

[17:26:46] <tcsilver> I don't think i use any threads in this particular app.. maybe one of the libs uses them ?

[17:28:15] <InPhase> tcsilver: You didn't specify the gui system in use, but most of them have hooks for the window close event.  On the main window, depending on how you created it, you might need to put a hook into that exit event that resultingly closes the main thread, even if there are not other threads.

[19:40:47] <mrig> I'm going low level, writing a platform abstraction layer for every kernel that I use, and doing the rest myself. Seems to be the most logical approach right now :)
[19:40:48] <merijn> [itchyjunk]: compression is a bijection (i.e. you can go from input to output and back from output to input), to do that, every input has to have a unique output
[19:41:38] <mrig> do you think apple would sue if I call my editor imacs?
[19:41:57] <[itchyjunk]> right, so keeping the N-1 inputs bijective, you have 2^(N) - 2^(N-1) choices for last big
[19:41:57] <merijn> [itchyjunk]: The number of possible unique outputs that is shorter than the input is, by definition, a smaller number than possible inputs. So logically there must be some inputs that cannot map to a shorter output (unless multiple inputs map to the same output, but then you no longer have a bijection, since you cannot recover the input from all outputs)
[19:42:07] <[itchyjunk]> but can't i do the same with N-1 and N-2 bits etc?
[19:42:12] <^-^hi> mrig: it would definitely sue if you called it oranges
[19:42:29] <^-^hi> they act like they invented fruits
[19:42:49] <merijn> [itchyjunk]: Sure, but then realise that we also have inputs for those bit sizes :p

[19:44:38] <merijn> and then the same for outputs. But you still run into the issue that "the number of unique output values that are shorter than their input" is smaller than the number of inputs you have
[19:44:40] *** Joins: Atque (~Atque@user/atque)
[19:46:29] <[itchyjunk]> Working out an example, say I want to compress N = 4 bits. this means i would have 16 inputs and i want the outputs to be < 16?

[19:47:21] <deniska> merijn: (actually I don't remember much about that channel, didn't hang out there much)
[19:48:17] <merijn> [itchyjunk]: Well, compression should be shorter, yeah. So what's shorter than 4 bits? 3 or less
[19:48:33] <merijn> But there's only 8 3bit values and 16 4bit values
[19:48:43] <[itchyjunk]> right
[19:49:11] <merijn> So 8 of your 4bit inputs can't have a shorter output
[19:49:15] <[itchyjunk]> so i have 8 bit left for that last bit
[19:49:24] <merijn> Even if you say "well, I can also use shorter bit sequences as output!"
[19:49:58] <[itchyjunk]> hmm is this the type of stuff cloude shannon figured out?
[19:49:58] <merijn> because 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 14
[19:50:20] <merijn> So if you compress 4bit values into 1, 2, or 3 bit strings, you're still 2 outputs short
[19:50:26] <[itchyjunk]> oh doing that actually makes it less compressed?
[19:50:31] <[itchyjunk]> trippy
[19:51:04] <merijn> Claude Shannon's work is highly related to a bunch of these things, yes
[19:51:51] <[itchyjunk]> I wrote a paper on information theory at one point but i don't remember anything at all :<

[19:54:10] *** Joins: snake (~snake@user/snake)
[19:54:23] <merijn> [itchyjunk]: With lossless compression there are always *some* inputs that don't compress about. But humans generally don't care about compressing "random garbage"
[19:54:44] <merijn> And depending on compression scheme you can influence *which* values end up being uncompressible
[19:54:58] <GeDaMo> ASCII text is usually stored in 8-bit bytes but most of the 256 values are not used
[19:55:09] <merijn> So you try and construct it so things like "human text" *are* compressible

[21:06:19] <^-^hi> BSD developers disagree
[21:06:59] <InPhase> Sounds like a retroactive excuse.  Wikipedia agrees there was no impact, it seems.  "William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz were never parties to these or subsequent lawsuits or settlements arising from this dispute with the University of California, and continued to publish and work on the 386BSD code base before, during, and after these lawsuits without limitation.   There has never been any legal 
[21:07:05] <InPhase> filings or claims from the university, USL, or other responsible parties with respect to 386BSD. Finally, no code developed for 386BSD done by William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz was at issue in any of these lawsuits."

[21:08:44] <mawk> even though hurd started earlier
[21:09:26] <InPhase> Hurd vs Linux was in part a debate about microkernels vs monolithic design, for which it seems monolithic was preferred by people.  Maybe it was also cultural and a matter of social groups.  But mostly people seemed to prefer the opportunities of the monolithic design at the critical times.

[21:16:37] <InPhase> There was a mass collective agreement among developers that the whole benefitted greatly if the most commonly used software was open, which was believed to be the inevitable result of making it the best, which was believed to be possible if enough people coordinated on it and it was guaranteed to stay open.  The framework for this made that collective effort happen.
[21:16:41] <^-^hi> And I say copyleft didn't bring that as well. It was Linus using GNU stuff, and Linux taking off because BSD was stuck in lawsuits, also it being made to be fast on i386 should have played an initial spark in the interest people had in it.

[21:20:12] <InPhase> ^-^hi: I saw very many conversations throughout the 90s about why people contributed to Linux vs BSD, especially while BSD was superior.  No one was worried one bit about lawsuits.  People who contributed to BSD thought this was about more purity of openness in that the code could be reused for anything.  But a much LARGER number contributed to Linux and with the reason that they wanted an open 
[21:20:18] <InPhase> source platform to win the competitive market.  And it did, because they collectively believed this would work, and because companies making use of it were not able to reuse it in a proprietary way.  With gradual transitions, companies adopted to reusing open source software in open source ways.  Even Microsoft has been transformed by this, and they were one of the very strong holdouts.
[21:21:06] <manicennui> WTF is this?
[21:21:47] <manicennui> It seems like you two pasted a conversation into the channel.
[21:22:18] <InPhase> VS Code might be under an MIT license, but VS Code was open sourced because Microsoft had a cultural transition about open source when they realized they needed Linux and other software internally a great deal, and that they had to start being a member of the open source community rather than an embrace-extend-extinguish competitor as was their original strategy.

It was Apple hardware so I had no idea how to put more memory in the mac mini, so I switched to a regular 4GB RAM PC. besides, I am not a big fan of hunting for the right kind of memory 
[21:34:49] <manicennui> I believe there is something you can do at the command line to install them too.
[21:34:52] <PamiPetteri> to install it, so I stick to this original 4GB. Changing the hard drive was easy enough, when the old one started to break down. Apple hardware has been designed to be difficult to tinker with.

[21:39:15] <InPhase> manicennui: For icing on the cake of developer unfriendly, Apple has deprecated Python3 as of 2 years ago, promising to remove it so that people can no longer count on Python code running on macs anymore without special setup instructions.
[21:39:20] <pyzozord> why not impossibly simple, I'd prefer that much more
[21:39:46] <merijn> InPhase: What? They've deprecated system python, which is python 2.7
[21:39:53] <deniska> InPhase: preinstalled python is more harm than good
[21:39:56] <merijn> InPhase: macOS doesn't ship python3 at all, never has
[21:40:18] <pyzozord> InPhase: I actually agree, I don't think python should be shipped with any os
[21:40:23] <InPhase> merijn: "Scripting language runtimes such as Python, Ruby, and Perl are included in macOS for compatibility with legacy software. Future versions of macOS wonâ€™t include scripting language runtimes by default, and might require you to install additional packages. If your software depends on scripting languages, itâ€™s recommended that you bundle the runtime within the app."
[21:40:33] <InPhase> "legacy software"
[21:41:09] <merijn> InPhase: Yes, Python2.7 is
[21:41:14] <merijn> python3 never has been

[21:42:33] <merijn> No it doesn't? Never has for me anyway, unless you're using some 3rd party stuff that's causing that
[21:42:49] <pyzozord> imo os should not ship with any programming language
[21:42:58] <InPhase> It really shouldn't be that challenging to bundle support for the most popular language runtimes so that there is a viable scripting base by default on operating systems.
[21:43:06] <InPhase> pyzozord: They really should, for the sake of developers.
[21:43:17] <merijn> And who decides which ones?
[21:43:19] <InPhase> pyzozord: It means you can count on them for build systems.
[21:43:19] <deniska> The way debian/ubuntu ship python was a major source of pain for the actual python developers for quite a while
[21:43:36] <merijn> I mean, python packaging and development is a clusterfuck anyway...
[21:43:36] <pyzozord> InPhase: my argument is that most users aren't developers, and developers are skilled enough to install what they need
[21:43:52] <pyzozord> in general I'm not a fan of including stuff

[21:49:26] <vdamewood> I think I have 3 or 4 Pythons installed on my Mac.
[21:49:57] <InPhase> manicennui: Excellent.  But I said "for developers" not because developers need it installed for them, but because developers need to implement to a target, and it just made that much more difficult by weakening the target.  Now developers need to write additional things to check of Python is there and setup Python if it's not just to run what could be 5 lines of Python code.
[21:50:00] <manicennui> Basically everyone in the Python, Ruby, and a couple other communities use version management tools and do not use the system version.
[21:50:01] <pyzozord> but my idea is very lofty and somewhat detached from the gritty reality. In reality it's probably much more convenient to have python there

[22:26:51] <manicennui> It is difficult to measure things like software engineer effectiveness and productivity.
[22:26:57] <pulse> electronEnergy, That's how a bad manager thinks.
[22:27:00] <manicennui> The test you mentioned earlier is terrible.
[22:27:03] <pulse> A good manager can see beyond metrics.
[22:27:05] <InPhase> electronEnergy: Yes.  Except evaluations of code quality are very expensive to do objectively, because most of what we're looking for is the long term maintenance costs of a particular piece of code, for which experience heuristics are the best short term measure.
[22:27:08] <electronEnergy> bad manager vs good manager is subjective.
[22:27:16] <manicennui> You don't even describe how you would objectively determine which results are better.
[22:27:19] <electronEnergy> It's not scientifically measured

[22:27:32] <flakland> managers that can't program are useless

[23:40:05] <electronEnergy> jacekowski in the UK, I know one guy who has done 15 houses like that. Some of them are now already fully paid. I know him since I lived in one of the houses (and had a few flatmates). There are usually 2 people per bedroom, sometimes more, and I believe it was very profitable because each person paid some amount. I think it was GBP 350 per person. That's GBP 700 per bedroom, and for example 3 bedrooms.

[23:42:01] <electronEnergy> other times, a large bedroom was partitioned into 2 smaller rooms, each for GBP 550 pcm. So, instead of for example GBP 800 for a large bedroom, it was GBP 1100 in total for the same bedroom (partitioned).

[23:43:59] <jacekowski> that is now classed as HMO and you have to deal with licensing and permits
