[02:08:58] <indomitable> circle jerk == productive
[02:08:59] <indomitable> got it
[02:09:02] <indomitable> nazis be nazi-ing
[02:09:30] <stenno\OK> how was that a circle jerk lmao
[02:09:36] <stenno\OK> also be careful who you call nazi
[02:09:53] <indomitable> stenno\OK, anybody who backs armed fascists showing up to protests to threaten people, and then shoot people in "self defence", are nazis
[02:10:14] <stenno\OK> well yeah
[02:10:14] <indomitable> if you bring a GUN to a PROTEST, you are a fucking retard if you think self defence is applicable
[02:10:18] <indomitable> I don't care what gun rights you have
[02:10:26] <indomitable> you went there looking for trouble
[02:10:31] <indomitable> and you found it when you killed 2 people in "self defence"
[02:10:37] <stenno\OK> thats what i said
[02:10:46] <indomitable> If I brought a knife illegally ANYWHERE, and ended up stabbing someone who threatened me somehow - that's on ME.
[02:10:47] <indomitable> I brought the knife there
[02:10:49] <indomitable> I should never have had it
[02:10:54] <stenno\OK> yes we talked about this
[02:11:05] <indomitable> akronymus[m] basically just reiterated that he loves fascism and guns
[02:11:18] <indomitable> and Deide chimed in on yes, he agreed
[02:11:50] <indomitable> my grandfather killed dozens of nazis like them during the war, and i will sign up to do the same. he didn't use a gun. he found them in the night and slit their balls off or their throats.
[02:14:00] <indomitable> it's very easy to forget what fascism and nazism are. it's when you start recruiting kids to show up with guns to protests.
[02:17:17] <stenno\OK> i know very well what those things are, you are barking against the wrong tree
[02:18:48] <indomitable> there's just too low a barrier for propaganda these days
[02:18:57] <indomitable> no one learns critical thinking
[02:20:53] <Deide> Hello indomitable , when you say fascist, what exactly do you mean?
[02:21:00] <akronymus[m]> At least i allow others to have differing opinions.
[02:21:12] <indomitable> you have alternate facts, not opinions
[02:21:53] <indomitable> in no universe is it ok to show up to a protest with an AR15, shoot someone in "self defence", and cry after showing nazi white power symbols with your white power nazi friends
[02:22:00] <indomitable> and then think this is all going to go away for people watching
[02:22:05] <akronymus[m]> Yeah, alternate facts as in the trial itself.
[02:22:16] <akronymus[m]> As opposed to your... what?
[02:22:48] <indomitable> the trial itself explained how fucking retarded it would be for someone to bring a gun to a protest if it wasn't to cause trouble?
[02:22:59] <indomitable> illegally at that
[02:23:09] <akronymus[m]> It was legal.
[02:23:12] <indomitable> no
[02:23:12] <indomitable> it was not
[02:23:18] <indomitable> and you would know that if you weren't a nazi fucktard
[02:23:20] <akronymus[m]> How so?
[02:23:28] <indomitable> you lied when you said you followed the trial
[02:23:40] <indomitable> people like you always fucking do.
[02:23:43] <indomitable> nazis can all burn in hell.
[02:23:59] <akronymus[m]> Oh wow. I lied. How?
[02:24:08] <akronymus[m]> Because it is news to me.
[02:24:16] <indomitable> you didn't watch the trial
[02:24:17] <indomitable> because this is mentioned
[02:24:19] <indomitable> numerous times
[02:24:23] <akronymus[m]> And how is the gun illegal?
[02:24:30] <indomitable> so you're sitting here lying making shit up while masturbating to nazi porn
[02:24:41] <indomitable> if you have to ask that after bragging about how you watched the trial, just stfu you nazi cunt, and take the noose when we hang you
[02:25:00] <indomitable> there were people like you defending the nazi soldiers committing genocide last time around
[02:25:02] <indomitable> we hung those too
[02:25:35] <akronymus[m]> Oh, the fact that the charge for illegal posession of a gun was thrown out doesn't count?
[02:25:35] <indomitable> unbelievable that someone austrian/german doesn't understand how fucking retarded these statements you make are
[02:25:47] <indomitable> just go die
[02:27:02] <akronymus[m]> yknow, i have been trying to be civil with you.
[02:28:07] <indomitable> I'm not civil with nazis akronymus[m] 
[02:28:09] <indomitable> go die :p
[02:28:26] <indomitable> compromising with nazis is not acceptable
[02:29:04] <indomitable> when you realize this fucker took selfies bragging with known neo nazis before this trial even started
[02:29:10] <indomitable> and you still defend him and pretend this was self defence
[02:29:15] <indomitable> you are either retarded, and should stfu, or a nazi
[02:29:18] <Deide> I'm sure the other side says the same of you and calls you a fascist. And then you get kids showing up to riots with rifles.
[02:29:19] <indomitable> you get to be not-retarded today
[02:29:27] <indomitable> Deide, you don't even know what fascism is you fucking retard.
[02:29:40] <indomitable> unbelievable
[02:29:53] <indomitable> well I'll be signing up for "self defending" against you scum when that time comes
[02:30:05] <indomitable> goddamn fucking nazis rising again. unbefuckinglievable.

[02:30:23] <Deide> Quite possible, which is why I asked you what you meant, since it's thrown around willy nilly these days.
[02:33:56] <Deide> On a side note, when you speak to people like this - especially in person where it's much more impactful - you do run the risk of steering them towards real fascism. I honestly do not think it's the way forward.
[02:33:56] <Deide> But I know it's hard to come back from emotively telling people to die and admitting enjoyment from the thought of murdering someone; so I just hope you think about it in future encounters instead.

[12:01:22] <MatthiasVance> biberu: I've been testing stuff in Rider now and it seems that when I pick MSBuild 17 it also fails (kind of expected), so now I'm thinking what if I change the MSBuild used for a project in VS
[12:01:35] <MatthiasVance> biberu: There is PlatformToolset, but that doesn't seem to do anything (yet)
[12:09:30] <MatthiasVance> Hm that seems to be more of a C++ thing
[12:19:10] <MatthiasVance> Ah you can use ToolsVersion but then it wants the MSBuild version in the current VS MSBuild directory
[12:46:28] <biberu> MatthiasVance: hm, sorry, no useful input on that

[12:47:57] <akronymus[m]> Does the version do a fuzzy match or a exact one?
[15:42:32] <MatthiasVance> They will shoot lasers at my eye balls next week :D
[15:45:36] <biberu> 7 days to master a braille keyboard then?
[15:55:15] <MatthiasVance> After ~3 days I can drive a car again (if all goes well) so shouldn't be an issue :D
[16:17:33] <akronymus[m]> My eyes are probably too bad for getting lasik
[16:52:11] <MatthiasVance> There are more options if you are still considering something like that

[17:19:15] <akronymus[m]> I have been thinking about getting some surgery for a long time.
[17:19:28] <akronymus[m]> But I probably will still think about it for a long time.
[17:22:05] <MatthiasVance> akronymus[m]: Yeah I stopped thinking about it until I got the money together
[17:22:13] <MatthiasVance> So that when I made a decision I could actually go with it
[17:22:23] <MatthiasVance> akronymus[m]: Why not get some more information about possibilities? :)
[17:22:51] <akronymus[m]> Oh, I read up on it a bit before.
[17:23:06] <akronymus[m]> Just something I am unsure about whether I actually wanna get it.
[17:30:20] <MatthiasVance> Ah :D
[17:30:34] <MatthiasVance> I get dry eyes with lenses, otherwise that would be a good alternative for me
