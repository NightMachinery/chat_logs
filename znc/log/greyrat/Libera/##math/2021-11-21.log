[03:06:33] <int-e> According to that definition: x = ct, y = dt with (c,d) != (0,0). And then you check how many roots y^2 = x^2(1+x) has once you plug that in (so it becomes an equation in t).

[04:35:37] *** Joins: Kaylah (~Kaylah@ptr-eit6u3hbfvbbt6to8t5.18120a2.ip6.access.telenet.be)
[04:36:12] <Kaylah> hello, I have a practical issue that I would like to approach and I think it involves some maths
[04:37:04] <Z-module> go on
[04:37:44] <Kaylah> the situation is the following: I am part of an online live help service where problems by users come in every now and then, and the 'employees' (such as myself) are able to set themselves as candidates to be the one to help with the issue
[04:38:17] <Kaylah> there is also a payment per issue that you help with, but you are able to 'bid' how much you want to earn for it, and of course the lower you bid, the higher the chance that you get it
[04:39:04] <Z-module> Are those payments paid by the people seeking help?
[04:39:09] <Kaylah> other than that, there are 2 scores that also determine how likely you are to get an issue, there's an averaged rating by the users and an averaged rating by admins who randomly review your help sessions
[04:39:20] <Kaylah> indirectly yes, they pay the company, and the company then pays you
[04:39:29] <Kaylah> but for the users the prices are fixed of course
[04:39:39] <Z-module> okay
[04:39:51] <Kaylah> so if an issue comes in with a description that seems very easy, then typically the employees will bid less, because they'll be finished with it faster
[04:39:58] <Kaylah> but the users obviously pay the same regardless
[04:40:28] <Z-module> Is it an algorithm deciding which employee gets the question?
[04:40:36] <Kaylah> so when an issue comes in, several employees can bid on it, and then there's an algorithm that determines who gets it, which is based on those 3 parameters: the bid (must be as low as possible) and the 2 ratings (must be as high as possible)
[04:40:41] <Kaylah> exactly, yes
[04:40:41] <Z-module> aha
[04:40:56] <Kaylah> but the exact details of the algorithm are not shared with us, understandably
[04:41:03] <Z-module> of course
[04:41:27] <Kaylah> but I am thinking of contacting the other employees to start recording our results together, so that I can back-engineer it, or however you call it
[04:41:29] *** Quits: texasmusicinstru (~Rheanna@61.171.21.169) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:41:51] <Kaylah> so if there would only be 2 parameters (for simplicity), I could create a plot with 2 axes, each representing a parameter
[04:42:06] <Z-module> So the algo is hopefully designed to:  (1) save the company money, but balanced with: (2) optimizing the chance that the user will get their issue fully dealt with competently.
[04:42:07] <Kaylah> and then for a certain issue, I could plot a dot for each employee
[04:42:26] <Kaylah> indeed, exactly
[04:42:30] <Kaylah> it's a smart system tbh
[04:42:55] <Kaylah> so I could plot a dot for each employee that bids on a certain issue, and then one dot would win, which we would also know
[04:43:12] <Kaylah> and I suppose that if I have enough plots like that, I could start creating "iso-chance-lines" or something
[04:43:27] <Z-module> Does each employee know those two ratings at all times?
[04:43:29] <Kaylah> i.e. lines through this 2D graph on which the chance to get the issue is the same
[04:43:34] <Kaylah> they do, yes
[04:43:36] *** Joins: texasmusicinstru (~Rheanna@218.78.105.67)
[04:44:03] <Kaylah> so when an issue comes in, I could get as many employees as possible to record their ratings at that time, as well as their bid, as well as whether they won the bid or not
[04:44:19] <Z-module> sounds reasonable
[04:44:42] <Kaylah> so by doing this for a lot of sessions, I could determine how those iso-chance-lines are shaped
[04:45:03] <Z-module> I imagine the algo *also* knows the timeline of each employee's interactions in this system, going back a few months or whatever
[04:45:16] <Z-module> and also how long each issue took to resolve
[04:45:22] <Kaylah> I suppose so
[04:45:49] <Z-module> Sounds like your idea could be fruitful
[04:45:55] <Kaylah> yay
[04:46:04] <Z-module> assuming the other employees who help out don't lie.

[04:47:38] <Kaylah> if x and y are two parameters that should both be as high as possible, then the circled dot could be the one that wins in this case
[04:47:49] <Kaylah> and those lines I drew here are the lines I ultimately want to determine
[04:48:06] <Kaylah> So each point on a certain line would have the same chances of winning
[04:48:24] <Kaylah> all points on  a lower line also have the same chance of winning, but obviously a lower chance than the lines above it
[04:49:31] <Kaylah> so with the 3 parameters it would be the same principle, but in 3D space and with surfaces instead of lines

[05:01:39] <ProfSimm> rex, what I mean is let's say all I had was addition and subtraction so I wanted to generate a sequence where the more I go, the more the last two numbers of the sequence divided approach Pi
[05:01:41] <Kaylah> perhaps that's not necessarily correct though, because the iso-chance-line can make crazy bends and all
[05:02:09] <ProfSimm> rex, the steps of the sequence should be computed just addition and subtraction like Fibonachi
[05:02:43] <Guest95> andrew have you read the implicitization section in chapter 3 yet?
[05:03:49] <Kaylah> but I don't know what else I could do

[05:06:25] <rex> ProfSimm: obviously it is :) but it's a sequence that might fit your parameters

[05:07:21] <Kaylah> but there's another important question: is there really a lot of benefit to even determining how the algorithm works?
[05:07:23] <Z-module> not offhand, Kaylah. But if the total dataset isn't too large, some sort of exhaustive ordering could be done easily.
[05:07:38] <rex> ProfSimm: addition and substraction of what?

[05:11:46] <ProfSimm> rex, using more predecessors is fine I guess
[05:12:10] <rex> ProfSimm: does it need to be fixed many or can it fluctuate?
[05:12:22] <andrew> When you have k=R, try the parametrization with x=t^2 and y=t^2. You'll get "half" of a line, because negative values of x and y don't appear in that parametrization.
[05:12:41] <ProfSimm> rex, well since it's an approximation I suppose it might go up/down until it narrows in on pi later in the sequence
[05:12:43] <Guest95> oh thats what they meant by that hint
[05:13:47] <andrew> Yeah it took me a bit of trial-and-error to find the right technique. Basically, when your field's not algebraically closed, there might be things that appear in your variety that can't appear in the parametrization.
[05:14:21] <rex> ProfSimm: I don't think you can approximate π in that way
[05:14:23] <andrew> The x=t^2, y=t^2 parametrization gives the full line when k=C
[05:15:00] <andrew> Another example appears in exercise 6 of section 3.3, I believe

[05:16:01] <rex> ProfSimm: suggests that solutions to such problems need to be algebraic, but π is transcendent
[05:17:06] <Decker> so I have this thing I was experimenting with parallel transports on spheres...
[05:17:36] <Guest95> andrew I'll take a look.
[05:17:40] <Decker> I started with 5 line segments, which start from 0, have a length, and then each following line segment turns some amount, and has another arc length forward...
[05:17:45] <ProfSimm> rex, reading what that implies. thanks a lot for your help

[05:18:25] <Decker> when I do a circular path, the length I have to take for each step varies depending on the curvature
[05:18:38] <Decker> how much does it vary? :)
[05:18:43] <Kaylah> mr Z-module, I think I know how to best approach it as objectively as possible
[05:18:57] <Kaylah> consider the graphs of 2 issues here, one in green and one in black:
[05:18:58] <Kaylah> https://i.imgur.com/Jmn4bCj.jpg
[05:19:11] <andrew> When I did 3.3 I think the only exercises my professor wanted me to do were 2, 3 and 6, so I won't be much help with the other problems unless I actually spend time working on them.
[05:19:18] <Kaylah> for each issue, I can connect all of the "outer points", and one of these points will be the winning point (the circled one)
[05:19:52] <Decker> as the curvature increases, for a while, I had to turn less at each segmnt if I break the circle into 100 line segments
[05:20:11] <Decker> then I had to turn much more less
[05:20:44] <Kaylah> then I can objectively say that the exact iso-chance-line that goes through the winning green point must lie between the green and black line, right?
[05:21:59] <Guest95> no worries. I'm trying out 6 right now
[05:22:14] <Kaylah> I guess you do have to assume that the exact iso-chance-line doesn't behave too irregularly
[05:22:20] <Kaylah> with sudden jumps in its course

[05:37:18] <Decker> https://i.ibb.co/1RtQ5LM/image.png  at near 0 curvature, it's easy to step around (right side), at a little bit more, this is too much to back off the yaw per step(middle) and then later it's not enough of a backoff... so there's overlap at the start and end of the circle.

[10:36:41] <adlai> greenbagels, the lectures don't really cover problem sets.
[10:37:32] <greenbagels> or rather i mean are you supplementing the lectures with problems that you would find from a non visual source
[10:37:36] <adlai> the theorems are understandable only from the audio, although the intuitive proofs given in place of formal ones are frequently accompanied by illustrated examples for groups of small order that can be depicted entirely in the video
[10:37:43] <ESphynx> adlai: who would be a good / ethical person / organization to review this? is posting to arxiv.org a way to go?
[10:37:54] <adlai> the lectures are to supplement my attention deficit disorder while eating food
[10:37:57] <adlai> lol
[10:38:05] <adlai> I wouldn't go to youtube looking for problem sets!
[10:38:43] <greenbagels> ESphynx: you need to be affiliated with a uni specifically for arxiv afaik
[10:39:00] <greenbagels> xivra is where the unaffiliated people post, but its usually full of crank nonsense
[10:39:06] <adlai> ESphynx, that is a reasonable place to upload drafts for review, although my impression was that your question was how to get reviewers to actually review a paper, rather than merely how to make a draft available.
[10:40:07] <adlai> greenbagels, for problem sets I have Gallian's book on Abstract Algebra, which has solutions to half the problems
[10:41:21] <ESphynx> basically, how likely is it that I've solved the Collatz conjecture?
[10:41:26] <ESphynx> proved*
[10:41:33] <adlai> my question should have been specifically which lecture series is recommended after VGT

[10:43:31] <adlai> ESphynx, are you familiar with Conway's proof of the unresolvability of the generalisation of the Collatz conjecture?
[10:43:44] <adlai> no, your assumption is totally wrong
[10:43:48] <ESphynx> I am not
[10:44:46] <ESphynx> so your hunch is that I did not prove it to be true then ;) I would kind of have the same hunch given my poor background in math.... Yet here I am trying to put this together as a proof, because so far I am convince what I figured out proves it.
[10:45:04] <adlai> these are more similar to the question of whether you can prove the parallel postulate instead of taking it as an axiom.
[10:45:58] <mornfall> ESphynx: the chances are very, very, very slim
[10:46:03] <isekaijin> ESphynx: Just post it to the arXiv.
[10:46:11] <greenbagels> isekaijin: they can't, they aren't affiliated

[10:46:54] <adlai> ESphynx, I was actually too hasty in dismissing your assumption; the specific case of Chaitin's constant does fall under what you wrote.
[10:47:09] <isekaijin> Although that decreases the chances of getting shredded to tears by reviewers, rather than just being ignored.

[12:05:35] <Crash1hd> hey everyone.  I have a calc that I feel I am doing wrong. I have a min and a max trying to get the percentage this is the formula I am using. ((val - min) / (max - min)) * 100; the min is -40 and the max is 215 the value is 50
[12:06:11] <qergle> looks good
[12:06:18] <Crash1hd> according to that the val is 37%
[12:06:22] <Crash1hd> is that right?
[12:06:54] <Crash1hd> cause if I take -40 + 215 / 2 that should give me the middle right? which is 104
[12:07:10] <qergle> maybe closer to 35%
[12:07:36] <Crash1hd> ok cause 104 comes out to 56% not 50?
[12:07:42] <qergle> the middle is 127.5
[12:07:43] <Crash1hd> thats where I am confused
[12:07:48] <qergle> i am not following your calculations
[12:08:08] <Crash1hd> I was always under the impression to get middle you take x + y / 2
[12:08:49] <Crash1hd> -40 + 215 / 2 = 67 so how do you get 127?
[12:08:58] <qergle> ok, from -40 to 215 you have 255, so halfway is -40 + 255/2
[12:09:10] <Crash1hd> why 255?

[12:09:36] <Crash1hd> right
[12:09:50] <Crash1hd>  so halfway is -40 + 255/2

[13:51:24] <savask> rapha: Why don't you replace x2, ..., x9 by x1 then

[13:53:34] <savask> It does indeed

[13:55:06] <savask> Yeah

[13:58:49] <W> rapha, I've only encountered that kind of expression in harmonic means, when there's usually a numerator with the number of elements, that's missing here. If that's not where the expression comes from in this case, never mind

[13:59:19] <W> (the harmonic mean of identical values should be that value)
[13:59:51] <rapha> W: it's resistance of 9 resistors in parallel
[14:00:43] <W> ah yes, resistors in parallel can be replaced by identical resistors with the same resistance (and indeed then the number of elements disappears from the numerator)

[14:03:49] <Decker> ya know divide is just multiply flipping the denominator

[18:37:39] <rex> Hi I'm stuck at the following problem: let L/K be a field extension with degree n and N the normal closure. Show that [N:K] | n!

[18:38:29] <rex> L/K is algebraic
[18:39:17] <rex> If L/K would be simple, then the statement would be simple, because then N would be a splitting field over some polynomial with degree f and those have that property
[18:39:22] <riv> n! is the worst possible case
[18:40:26] <riv> its when you add a root from the deg poly and then a root of deg n-1 poly and so on
[18:41:08] <riv> we have [L:K] | n!  dont we?
[18:41:11] <rex> You mean the statement can even be restricted to [N:K] ≤ n! ?

There's a construction, taking a good 6ish pages of work, of a continuous nonconstant  g: [0,1] -> R  with the property that for every x and every open interval U containing x, g takes the value g(x) at at least one point of U\{x}.  (Called a "locally recurrent" function.)  By using countably many scaled/translated copies of g, we can make a locally recurrent continuous surjective h: R -> R.   Now
[23:13:45] <Z-module> pi_1 o s o h   is continuous, surjective onto R, and every fiber is uncountable and dense in R.  I wonder if such thing aas this f is gettable without using the locally-recurrent construction.

[23:31:36] <Z-module> oh never mind, of course it's not true that every fiber of my  pi_1 o s o h   is dense in R.
[23:31:39] <tmyklebu> https://msp.org/pjm/1967/21-3/pjm-v21-n3-p04-s.pdf has a fairly simple construction of locally recurrent functions.

[23:35:26] <tmyklebu> pi_1 o s already gives you a continuous surjective function where every fibre is uncountable, no?  composing with a locally recurrent function adds local recurrence to the mix, but that's weaker than preimages being dense.

[23:37:27] <cherim> A continuous function is bounded on an interval, so you can't get everywhere dense preimages for all values in R
[23:37:28] <Z-module> right on the first thing
[23:37:51] <cherim> What do you want to get?

[23:41:06] <Z-module> Nothing more, I now realize
[23:41:45] <Z-module> There are some fun ways to make explicit functions f:R -> R  that take all real values on every open interval, but they're wildly discontinuous, of course.
