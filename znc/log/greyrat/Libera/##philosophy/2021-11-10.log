[00:02:17] <varde> Thinking about any moral good passively is pointless, we may as well call it reaping the reward than 'being beneficent and thus, good'; what's the point in moral lessons, it's merely the doctrine behind every day life; however, this is how it is understood philosophically. Pointless thinking of good, can be considered a faith asset, in which case it's pointlessness placid/sharp. In some way it is what the hole is to nature, is to man, in some way. Shou

[03:16:15] <causative> and you want to work out what this symbol means
[03:16:22] <Inhahe> well the scenario was yours (ordering pizza)
[03:16:48] <thunder> causative: there's a reason I chose that specific example
[03:16:52] <causative> what you're trying to do in this case, is slot the symbol into your mental machinery in a consistent way that is perhaps useful to your other goals
[03:17:08] <causative> you find a place for the symbol
[03:17:12] <thunder> okay. I follow you.
[03:17:17] <causative> you do the same with the bridge
[03:17:54] <causative> the meaning of the image on the postcard to you, is the way in which you slot it into your mental machinery, so as to obtain consistency and perhaps usefulness, e.g. usefulness to the goal of being able to later talk about the postcard with others

[03:18:51] <causative> Inhahe, the scenario I am referring to was yours, when you said  " what if there's only one way to do something, no slightly better or worse ways? then meaning could de said to be problem solving but not necessarily optimization in those cases, no?"
[03:19:04] <causative> give a specific example of that, if you think my example fails to be an example of it
[03:19:07] <thunder> I tend to describe that as comparison for a chosen desired similarity, which we interpret as the meaning.
[03:19:55] <Inhahe> causative: such a scenario is like you said, pressing a button to order pizza. you confound the issue when you conflate that with satisfying huger in general (that leaves more better solutions and worse solutions, so it's more like actual optimization0
[03:20:03] <Inhahe> huger=hunger
[03:20:13] <thunder> I guess you could say that's optimization, but to me optimization speaks more to efficiency. that may be a byproduct of the process, but I don't think that's the core pattern. or at least not how I'd choose to describe it atm.
[03:20:34] <causative> Inhahe, if someone presses the pizza button when *not* optimizing for the goal of satisfying hunger, then we'd have to look at what other goal they satisfied by pressing the button
[03:20:49] <causative> perhaps they wanted to talk to the delivery person
[03:20:53] <Inhahe> causative: what if we're talking about the top  goal, hypothetically
[03:21:05] <causative> if no goal was satisfied by pressing the button, then we would have to say that the pressing of the button was meaningless, accidental
[03:21:47] <thunder> if satisfying hunger is the goal, then one's choice is of something similar to what has satisfied it in the past. if one's goal is taste, perhaps similarly. if one's goal is new experiences, then the opposite.
[03:21:47] <causative> the difference between an accidental act and an intentional act is whether the act helps to optimize some objective
[03:22:23] <causative> similarity is too limited a way to look at this kind of thing thunder
[03:22:52] <causative> what if the picture is the same bridge, but colors inverted, flipped in a mirror? we still recognize what it is
[03:23:31] <causative> what if instead of the bridge we see a cat, but we are in a weird internet subculture where the golden gate bridge is represented by a cat?
[03:23:38] <thunder> it's an abstraction. difference, comparison, similarity, choice (not necessarily in that order). it's how we identify kind (ie. type, category, group, etc)
[03:23:48] <causative> then we say that the image represents the bridge, even though it is more visually similar to a cat than to the bridge
[03:25:10] <causative> similarity is a useful heuristic in some cases, but similarity depends on the choice of metric, and the problem is defining the metric properly - depending on your choice of metric you could say almost anything is "similar" to almost anything else
[03:25:34] <causative> so because of this difficulty choosing the metric, the concept of "similarity" does not guide us very well
[03:25:42] <thunder> similarity is the basis of metric
[03:25:49] <causative> other way around
[03:25:59] <thunder> we compare say a distance, based on some similarity (the unit of measure)
[03:26:08] <causative> a metric is a function d(a, b) which gives the "distance" between thing a and thing b
[03:26:21] <causative> similarity is the inverse of distance, or oppositely related to distance

[03:27:50] <causative> you can define a metric by which anything is very similar to anything else

[03:28:26] <causative> cheese could be very similar to rainbows, apples very similar to the number 7
[03:28:27] <thunder> feet is a unit of measure that was originally determined by the actual foot of a king
[03:28:47] <causative> it is better, instead, to look at what goals a symbol helps to optimize

[03:29:14] <causative> we want to know *why* a symbol is used - this is in other words, what goals the user of the symbol tried to fulfill, by using that symbol in the way he did

[03:33:23] <thunder> leap across the chasm from meaningless sound to indicated object by which the two become associated in meaning.

[04:12:47] <[666]> initiating a new activity is highly likely to be borne of optimization. continuing to reinitiate the same activity could be escaping conflict or part of a social obligation such as the workplace. would not necessarily be in the pursuit of optimization.
[04:14:41] <causative> escaping conflict is of course optimization, as is maintaining a social obligation
[04:16:07] <tomathy> what are you optimsing in escaping conflict?
[04:16:13] <[666]> is maintaining your optimized state the same as optimizing?
[04:16:53] <causative> yes, certainly - to maintain an optimized state you must keep choosing actions that optimize for it
[04:17:08] <causative> if you fail to choose such actions then you will exit the optimized state
[04:17:37] <causative> if you are choosing actions that escape conflict, you are optimizing to minimize conflict
[04:17:55] <[666]> unless the actions actually produce a suboptimal state...ergo the runner who has a heart attack.
[04:18:57] <apotheon> Well . . . causative is clearly talking about intentions, and not necessarily outcomes.
[04:19:04] <causative> yes, an optimization process does not *guarantee* that the outcome will be attained
[04:19:42] <causative> it is a good point and a problem to solve
[04:19:59] <causative> how can we tell when an optimization process is at work, given that it does not guarantee an optimized result?
[04:20:12] <tomathy> this sounds like the kind of think an AI would say
[04:20:18] <thunder> I'm starting to think you may be on to something causative

[04:20:31] <thunder> gotta think on it more
[04:20:44] <apotheon> Do you think causative may be on to something, generally, or specifically on to something that is causative?
[04:21:06] <thunder> about optimization being an important aspect of knowledge organization
[04:21:18] <apotheon> Sentences can get confusing when one of the people in a conversation has a name that could be useful in those sentences.
[04:21:27] <thunder> or possibly an emergent property. gotta think on it some more
[04:21:45] <apotheon> Think of this:
[04:21:59] <thunder> apotheon: I get notified constantly when people discuss the weather
[04:22:23] <apotheon> Pursuing a goal, and attempting to optimize for the reason to pursue the goal, are roughly synonymous in practice.
[04:22:40] <apotheon> . . . so we're really just talking about goal-pursuing beings.
[04:23:27] <apotheon> I often get notified when people misspell "disappoint".
[04:23:56] <tomathy> optimization is the goal though
[04:24:01] <tomathy> "goal" is reductive
[04:24:23] <apotheon> "reductive"
[04:24:29] <apotheon> do go on
[04:24:47] <thunder> when a person fasts for a few days, the body starts making the cells operate more efficiently and automatically starts recycling dead cell matter rather than expelling it as feces. similarly efficiency improvements occur for the immune system.
[04:25:13] <tomathy> we do things for the sake of optimizing ourselves or something beneficial to us, we only set goals then apotheon.
[04:25:18] *** Joins: xardas (~xhunter@149.233.51.127)
[04:25:50] <tomathy> and even then we might not
[04:26:13] <tomathy> you could say "the goal is optimisation" so maybe it isn't reductive
[04:26:21] <apotheon> I don't get what you're saying, perhaps because you're operating on a different definition of some term than me.
[04:26:41] <tomathy> no i'm just quite stupid so dont worry
[04:26:43] <xardas> Should one know about greek history before tackling greek philosophy ?
[04:27:00] <apotheon> One can be said to pursue a goal of optimization, but one could also be said to optimize for a goal.
[04:27:19] <apotheon> xardas: if you like
[04:27:25] <tomathy> thunder: why did you mention that?
[04:27:37] <xardas> apotheon yes or not ?
[04:27:50] <apotheon> depends on your goals
[04:27:59] <xardas> my goals are many
[04:28:27] <apotheon> I guess that makes it difficult for me to answer your question -- especially when I don't even know them.
[04:28:41] <apotheon> As for my goals, I think it's time for me to do some writing.
[04:29:00] <thunder> tomathy: perhaps the process of optimization isn't a conscious choice but is physiological in nature. not sure if you've heard of spiegelman's monster or not, but that's an interesting example that might apply to this idea of optimization. the way I tend view it the end game is copy/mix, whether that be genes or ideas.
[04:30:03] <xardas> apotheon gg
[04:30:16] <tomathy> yes i agree with that, it is embedded into us
[04:31:36] <thunder> sometimes this stuff is like the proverbial elephant and 3 blind sages. there're many ways to describe the same thing which each has their inherent truth, but none alone captures the whole of it.

[16:25:05] <arryana> i have nothing particular against anarchy.  i have often seen it glorified by people who don't know what they're talking about, unfortunately.
[16:28:24] <varde> Someone said to me earlier most things are violence related
[16:29:06] <varde> From the erection of governments(thinking literally) to the implementation of a policy(thinking actually).
[16:29:17] <varde> I'm thinking about it.
[16:30:37] <Atque> arryana: It's an old idea; no one has made it work. A goal's nice, but useless without some way there.
[16:33:06] <varde> I thought it was the featus form of Government. In an anarchist society, some power will eventually arise.
[16:33:39] <varde> If there is no leaders, people either become leaders through chaos or through harmony.
[16:33:50] <varde> I think...
[16:34:16] <varde> Can you have anarchy as a government type?
[16:34:42] <varde> It's 'no policy'. So, what is the state of the leadership, a spokes person?

[16:50:08] <varde> It depends because if it's considered an art form it can be funny. Unless the definition has changed to warrant a more serious statistic.
[16:50:25] <CaCode> abusing others out of sadism is neither art nor acceptable

[20:38:58] <causative> and the question of "ought" can be reduced to "determining how we want our own mind to work"
[20:39:51] <causative> every other question in philosophy is a question of how to order part of our minds - e.g. "do we have free will?" is a question of what patterns we want to put in our minds relevant to the question of "free will"
[20:40:33] <causative> "Should you kill one to save two?" again, a question of which mind-pattern we deem best in regard to that question

[20:43:55] <causative> we discriminate between mind-patterns on the basis of consistency with other mind-patterns, inference from other mind patterns, and usefulness towards our practical goals
[20:48:27] <causative> inference from other mind-patterns can be understood as a special case of consistency - when we infer B from A, this is implicitly because every other pattern that could take the same place as B is inconsistent with A
[20:48:56] <causative> so we eliminate those other patterns, forcing us to the conclusion B

[22:56:34] <causative> to the extent the brain does symbolic processing, it does it like a bear riding a bicycle - amazing that it does it at all
[22:58:08] <causative> the vast majority of our evolutionary history occurred before language, and most of our brain is still a relic from that time - it's designed for sensory and motor processing, for emotions, for mapping and navigation
[22:58:56] <causative> we share almost all of our brain structures with other mammals
[23:00:18] <causative> natural language reasoning cannot be captured by formal symbolic deduction - because the natural world does not follow clean categories and rules, except perhaps at the subatomic level

[23:13:07] <DPA> Most organisms must make predictions about the future. For complex things, this requires more than just sensory and emotional data.
[23:13:07] <DPA> I agree that approaches trying to put things into a ridged system like for example taxonomy can't work, but I don't think that giving up symbols and their relation is necessary just because of it.
[23:13:07] <DPA> I could imagine some system that uses symbols and relates them in different ways, for example using banyan probabilities, or other factors, depending on the use case to be determined, may still work.
[23:13:07] <DPA> If they don't - then I think we will never be able to compress the information necessary for a full general AI into a form efficient and small enough to be stored and used by a computer.
[23:13:25] <DPA> s/full/true/
[23:13:25] <ro-bot-o> DPA meant to say: If they don't - then I think we will never be able to compress the information necessary for a true general AI into a form efficient and small enough to be stored and used by a computer.
[23:14:01] <DPA> Interesting, I didn't know there was such a bot here.
[23:15:03] <causative> the state of the art basically everywhere in AI is neural
[23:15:47] <causative> GPT3, AlphaZero, AlphaStar, Google's machine translation, speech to text, text to speech, deepfakes
[23:16:01] <causative> image recognition
[23:18:08] <DPA> Yes. It's to be considered, though, that many problems can and have been solved imprecisely and inefficiently many times by application engineers like this, when they didn't fully understand a problem or it's solution, or it was more difficult to implement.
[23:18:08] <DPA> A brain is very much something not yet understood, so it is natural that we use the technique which works for those kinds of problems.
[23:18:24] <causative> we tried other techniques first
[23:18:29] <causative> we tried symbolic techniques first
[23:18:33] <causative> they didn't work
[23:18:49] <DPA> We never understood the problem, though. We still don't-
[23:19:34] <causative> we never will, the problem is too complex for us to fully understand it
[23:19:45] <causative> so instead we have to make systems that can adapt to the complexity by themselves
[23:19:57] <causative> neural networks can do that, symbolic programs not so much
[23:21:25] <causative> we need a system that is "soft" and can mold itself to the problem, like clay - we give it something similar to the right shape, then push the system against the problem (train it) until it molds itself properly
[23:23:05] <DPA> Neural net systems don't scale well. If a combined approach can't be found, no complete workable solution will ever emerge.
[23:23:33] <causative> neural nets scale fine
[23:23:59] <causative> it's symbolic processing that doesn't scale well - Cyc's ruleset became huge and unwieldy, and the inference time became too high
[23:24:15] <DPA> Not in regards to performance, when it comes to massive amounts of knowledge. GPT3 isn't fast.
[23:24:21] <causative> compared to what?
[23:24:27] <causative> nothing else does anything close to what GPT3 does

[23:24:50] *** Joins: plankster (~plankster@user/plankers)
[23:25:28] <DPA> Now I have a catch 22. I can't present a counter example without solving the problem.
[23:26:43] <causative> the human brain is an absolutely enormous network, the hardware used for GPT3 is a tiny fraction of what would be necessary for a brain-scale network

[23:28:42] <causative> the brain uses way more
[23:31:37] <[666]> if anyone figures out how to create a mini-distro of the BrainOS and how to bootstrap a mallard to load it...i'm all for it.
[23:32:18] <[666]> sentient talking ducks.
[23:32:41] <DPA> GPT3 can't tell truth from imagination at all, though. It has been shown that with more data, it just becomes more imaginative. To make a true AI, it will have to be combined with other nets or similar in a way that can share concepts & assess them for different properties.
[23:32:42] <DPA> That will make it a lot more complex, if it is possible at all, and surely will greatly slow it down.
[23:33:40] <DPA> And it is way easier to reuse things if you know what they are / what they represent / how they work.
