[03:10:35] <dostoyevsky2> Jong: Goodfellow focusses on understanding the basics...  Confusion Matrices have gained some popularity on kaggle over the years because they look presentable/self-explanatory in a notebook... but it's not a topic that needs to be explained in a book
[03:14:30] <HuntsMan> dostoyevsky2: they are explained, but not in that book, there are thousands of ML books that cover them
[03:15:02] <Jong> but I can't find AUROC mentioned in Godfellow either
[03:15:46] <HuntsMan> same answer
[03:15:56] <HuntsMan> if you want ML basics, then don't read a Deep Learning book
[03:15:58] <HuntsMan> read a Machine Learning book

[04:03:15] <HuntsMan> both books are available in github

[04:10:52] <Jong> HuntsMan  Have you heard of the book Artificial Intelligence A Modern Approach by Russell Norvig ?
[04:11:35] <HuntsMan> hahha yes
[04:15:28] <Jong> What do you think?
[04:16:33] <Jong> I bought it for $5 on ebay. I really like it for an old book

[04:38:19] <Jong> Reading the old books is interesting. The vocabulary is changes with time.

[15:18:35] <HuntsMan> that's not what I said
[15:18:40] <HuntsMan> but this does look as just tabular data
