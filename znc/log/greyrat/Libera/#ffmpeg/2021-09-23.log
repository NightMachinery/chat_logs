[01:25:26] <Build> I have a slight issue, I'm playing an SRT stream with ffplay and it works great. But when I drop packets or my connection hitches, I need the stream to automatically catch up. I managed to get this working through this command https://pastebin.com/vKrAuUfu
[01:25:47] <Build> however, there's an issue. When it skips ahead, the audio speeds up really slowly, and takes forever to catch back up to the video
[01:26:09] <Build> So the viewer just sits there with higher pitch audio for 5-30 seconds depending on the dropout
[01:26:33] <Build> Is there any way to accelerate that process or make it skip like the video does?
[01:28:29] <Build> Actually that last part of the command was a test I was doing that didn't work. This is the one that "sort of works" for now. https://pastebin.com/zdQSJV6t

[01:31:41] <BtbN> You got to select your quality tradeoff yourself. Lower resolution, lower x264 preset, higher crf if you use that, lower bitrate also to a degree, but usually not that influential

[01:51:15] <znf> hmmm, why isn't my -hls_flags delete_segments delete the actual segments?
[01:51:27] <znf> ls /tmp/*.ts | wc -l > 1723
[01:51:28] <znf> O.O
[01:53:45] <znf> I'm using:
[01:53:50] <znf> ./ffmpeg -y -loglevel verbose -fflags +genpts -async 1 -i 'URL' -vcodec copy -scodec copy -acodec copy -individual_header_trailer 0 -f segment -segment_format mpegts -segment_time 4 -segment_list_size 15 -segment_format_options mpegts_flags=+initial_discontinuity:mpegts_copyts=1 -segment_list_type m3u8 -hls_flags delete_segments -segment_list_flags '+live' -segment_list /tmp/188242_.m3u8 /tmp/188242_%d.ts
[01:56:12] <BtbN> -hls_flags is not an option of the segment muxer.
[01:56:22] <znf> well, shit
[01:56:25] <BtbN> Use the hls muxer if you want it to work
[01:56:46] <znf> ok, that's why they patched it...
[01:57:40] <BtbN> ?
[01:58:57] <znf> I have an app with a custom ffmpeg build
[01:59:04] <znf> which has +delete for -segment_list_flags
[01:59:46] <znf> thing is - I can't change much about the app, very limited possibilities
[01:59:57] <znf> I was hoping I could build a new ffmpeg, but it relies on +delete
[02:01:29] <znf> I think it's this https://patchwork.ffmpeg.org/project/ffmpeg/patch/20161008140242.11665-1-ffmpeg-dev@c-14.de/

[15:59:50] <BtbN> codec name for mp4?
[16:00:14] <volgar1x> sorry my finger slipped i wanted to write mp3
[16:00:32] <furq> no those are different codecs
[16:01:10] <volgar1x> do you know what its called by ffmpeg?
[16:01:18] <furq> if you want to encode mp3 then libmp3lame
[16:01:49] <furq> but also browsers generally only support aac in mp4 or opus in webm
[16:02:30] <furq> which is stupid because they all play mp3 by itself
[16:03:14] <volgar1x> furq: i see, thanks
[16:03:42] <furq> all the aac encoders in ffmpeg should outperform lame anyway
[16:03:47] <furq> fdk certainly does
[16:04:20] <volgar1x> furq: do you know if it's possible to play an audio track beside the video track in html5 `<video>` ?
[16:04:42] <furq> not that i know of unless it's muxed into the video
[16:05:03] <furq> you could maybe sync up an audio tag to play at the same time with js but that might fall foul of browser autoplay policies
[16:05:05] <volgar1x> most answers i found involve syncing two different `<video>` and `<audio>` which seems kind of gross
[16:05:14] <furq> also that
[16:05:54] <furq> https://docs.videojs.com/tutorial-audio-tracks.html
[16:05:59] <furq> that looks promising
[16:06:10] <volgar1x> okay so instead i'll try running ffmpeg.wasm in a streaming mode then
[16:07:31] <volgar1x> i wanted to use shaka-player at first but either DASH or HLS seemed too hard to implement by myself

[19:52:37] <InTheWings> JEEB: extradata is not set on the rtp context, so the SDP is never filled. I was wondering is there's an option that forces filling it (source is the libx264 encoder/annexb)
[19:53:34] <InTheWings> option like the mp4toannexb filters
[19:54:19] <JEEB> ok, I am a bit confused whether you're reading an SDP and it doesn't fill the data into the decoder's extradata, or that it doesn't get written into the output of an SDP writer?

[20:03:34] <InTheWings> sorry
[20:03:50] <JEEB> that is what I tried to verify :)
[20:04:22] <InTheWings> You can see the sps/pps are sent in-band in first rtp pkts
[20:04:22] <JEEB> because the first comments sounded like you had an SDP input which either lacked extradata string in it, or that the SDP reader did not parse/apply the extradata from it

[20:09:35] <JEEB> I am not sure I wanted to know about sdp_file today
[20:09:39] <JEEB> but now I know
[20:10:11] <JEEB> of course in a way it's better than random meta (de)muxers, but you just generally don't have this stuff
[20:11:16] <JEEB> anyways, that logic does indeed lead to libavformat/sdp.c::sdp_write_media_attributes which then utilizes extradata2psets
[20:12:52] <JEEB> ok, I did not read too much into ffmpeg.c's logic, but if it is indeed just passing the output avformat context's codecpar to it, then just telling libx264 to not have in-band parameter sets is the way
[20:12:59] <JEEB> the global_headers thing
[20:13:27] <JEEB> -flags +global_header
[20:13:46] <JEEB> the RTP muxer doesn't request that so it doesn't get set by libx264
[20:14:22] <JEEB> if the muxer would have AVFMT_GLOBALHEADER it would be utilized to configure the encoedr
[20:14:40] <JEEB> then there I think is a bsf if you want the parameter sets both in the SDP as well as in-band

[21:26:54] <InTheWings> JEEB: that would need a fix, no ? I mean, streaming rtp without providing the extradata by default does not seem right
[21:27:22] <InTheWings> JEEB: thanks for the hint, that should solve the issue on this side
[21:27:31] <JEEB> I have no idea whether in-band or out-of-band is the standard for RTP H.264 :)
[21:27:54] <JEEB> it seems like whomever implemented the thing never poked at the flag and was happy?
[21:28:00] <InTheWings> well... no random access is possible if that's inband
[21:28:31] <JEEB> for in-band I think of it like mpeg-ts, that you periodically with random access point get the parameter sets
[21:28:41] <JEEB> which would make sense in some cases since RTP is live

[21:30:15] <JEEB> I think there might or might not also be a thing where you can get extradata built in a muxer even though you're not a global header type of muxer
[21:30:19] <InTheWings> I've never seen h264 without sprop set before
[21:30:39] <JEEB> InTheWings: I'm also not sure if it's intentional
[21:30:50] <JEEB> since the SDP writing is just a random feature in ffmpeg.c
[21:30:59] <InTheWings> either it's set, or the mux format must repeat parameters
[21:31:11] <JEEB> yea
[21:31:39] <JEEB> I would have expected a setup without AVFMT_GLOBALHEADER leading to repeating
[21:31:55] <JEEB> although I haven't looked into mpegtsenc's related things
[21:31:57] <InTheWings> and I don't feel wrapping h264 into ts being correct as RTP aims low delay
[21:32:23] <JEEB> nah, I wasn't talking about that :) I do know that there is a mess that is MPEG-TS over RTP
[21:32:45] <JEEB> just that I expected output formats w/o that global header flag to have led libx264 to repeat the parameter sets at RAPs
[21:33:38] *** Quits: gnoo (~gnoo@user/gnoo) (Quit: gnoo)
[21:34:06] <JEEB> yes, b_repeat_headers is unset if global header is not set (and if you're not outputting the proprietary AVC-Intra stuff)
[21:34:19] <JEEB> and I expect x264 to default to 1
[21:34:21] <JEEB> lessee
[21:35:09] <JEEB> yup, I think common/base.c is where the defaults get set and it's = 1
[21:35:46] <JEEB> so in theory with libx264 and the RTP muxer you should be getting parameter sets at each RAP
[21:36:22] <JEEB> but I still do agree that even if you want in-band duplication of parameter sets, having them in the SDP is a Good Thing
[21:37:11] <JEEB> just don't recall how other things do that :P
