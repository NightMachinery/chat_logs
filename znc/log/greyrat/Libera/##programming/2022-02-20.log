[00:44:39] <DPA> Sure, but it can still be abstracted away. Linkers just link objects and libs. And this is really just needed for the standard library, which pretty much anyone in any language expects to always be included unless excluded explicitly, if that's even possible.

[00:45:50] <apotheon> Maybe the first step toward doing away with this tangle of build system nonsense is to write wrappers for compilers that are used for "standardizing"/regularizing a lot of stuff that, at present, is very irregular.
[00:46:15] <deniska> apotheon: build systems are… such wrappers
[00:46:24] <apotheon> not explicitly

[00:46:45] <apotheon> Start with little things.
[00:46:53] <apotheon> not with big things
[00:46:54] <deniska> their job is to launch compilers because compilers are generally hard to launch manually
[00:47:18] <apotheon> Build systems are "big things first".

[02:49:48] <absentia> which is not quite correct to say either but close enough
[02:50:08] <pulse> can i have a specific .gitignore for dev branch
[02:50:28] <absentia> uh i suppose
[02:50:37] <pulse> i've decided to get more in-depth into git and i can use my hobby project to train
[02:50:37] <absentia> i'm not actually sure, i haven't tried this
[02:51:08] <pyzozord> you can but as soon as you merge dev to master you will override master's .gitignore with dev's .gitignore
[02:51:32] <pyzozord> what you could do is setup up global .gitignore for your user
[02:51:32] <pulse> hmm
[02:51:35] <EdFletcher> you can easily have a file exist in only a specific branch by having it committed to only that branch. when you checkout another branch, it will disappear. you can also definitely have different contents for the same file across different branches. 
[02:51:49] <pyzozord> oh no nevermind that wouldn't work either
[02:51:55] <pulse> EdFletcher, yeah i guess the problem is i'm used to just doing git add -A
[02:51:58] <pulse> and that would kind of break that workflow
[02:52:22] <pulse> but if i could have a specific .gitignore in dev, then i could say !thisfile in it

[02:53:18] <pulse> that way i could pull dev from another pc and have it updated
[02:53:29] <pyzozord> what you can do is add .gitignore
[02:53:32] <pulse> practically speaking it doesn't really matter, i'm just wondering if it's possible
[02:53:38] <pyzozord> and then force add your file in one branch anyway

[02:54:10] <pyzozord> no

[02:55:36] <pyzozord> oh wait no I'm wrong
[02:55:47] <pulse> that won't translate to other machines
[02:55:48] <pyzozord> after you merge dev to master now master has that file too
[02:55:58] <pulse> i got so confused trying to visualize this just now
[02:56:11] <pyzozord> no no it would translate, problem is, you can't just systematically keep a file in one branch
[02:56:22] <pyzozord> branches are just pointer to commits
[02:57:06] <EdFletcher> so wait pulse: you want to have a .gitignore that is the same on `main` and `dev`, but you want to commit a file that would otherwise be ignored to only the `dev` branch? 
[02:58:10] <pyzozord> pulse: what you could do if you really wanted is use precommit hooks
[02:58:45] <pyzozord> custom scripts that run before commit where you could unadd the specific file if it's on the wrong branch etc

[03:00:23] <pulse> EdFletcher, yes
[03:00:27] <pyzozord> pulse: git way is to keep build_and_run.sh in all branches like normal
[03:00:31] <pulse> yes basically i forgot to mention that EdFletcher 
[03:00:38] <pyzozord> s/normal/normally you do in git/
[03:00:50] <pulse> the git way you say
[03:01:02] <pulse> can you merge without one file
[03:01:09] <pyzozord> yeah eaech branch holds a version of the same project
[03:01:14] <EdFletcher> pulse: yup no worries, glad i asked. so yeah, that doesn't really fit git's workflow, once you merge back down to `main` that file will be pulled along 
[03:01:17] <pyzozord> branches don't have special purposes
[03:02:07] <EdFletcher> you _can_ have a long-lived branch that is effectively just an upstream fork of your `main` in which you only ever pull changes from `main` in and never merge back down, where this model would work ok. 
[03:02:10] <pyzozord> sometimes they do but that's rare and kinf of akward
[03:02:16] <EdFletcher> but that incurs all sorts of other, worse pain

[03:05:35] <EdFletcher> if you let a branch diverge too far (don't rebase often enough), sometimes it can be completely untenable to merge back down. happened at the last place i was at when one guy was no a project with no oversight. we literally just renamed his branch to 'main'. 😦

[03:48:07] <KillerWasp> I have noticed that any connection on linux cannot work other than server and client. That is, there is no other way to establish a connection.
[03:48:08] <TonyStone> i need a simple way to invert colors... basically so if the user chooses black for an object the border should go white.  or if they choose green the border should be something that contrasts green... make sense?  Is there already some algorithm for this?  I would also need to take a third color into consideration... that would be the main background color this object is over.  
[03:48:38] <TonyStone> I am doing searches on the web for "color inversion" and i am not exactly finding what I want... i dont think
[03:48:59] <pulse> TonyStone, subtract it from white

[03:49:57] <KillerWasp> Once the connection is established, it no longer matters. But initially it is the problem, without a server and a client it is impossible to create a new connection. How else can you open a connection with just both IPs and both ports?
[03:50:03] <Decker> r'=255-r etc... only fails then for 128 128 128 :) which is its own contrast

[03:54:23] <pyzozord> o is important
[03:54:32] <KillerWasp> also: 255-r == r+1
[03:54:32] <inhahe_> rounin's approach is close to my approach and maybe simpler
[03:55:04] <TonyStone> yeah ... that requires me to understand luminance though
[03:55:12] <KillerWasp> no, bad...
[03:55:20] <TonyStone> i guess i could do a quick search on that lol...
[03:55:37] <pyzozord> color theory is a thing
[03:55:40] <KillerWasp> 255-r is a reverse, only r-255 is r+1
[03:55:44] <Rounin> It depends on what you want, too... If you just want to pick either white or black, then separating luminance and colour makes sense... But if you just want a red border for green etc., then subtracting each channel from 255 makes sense

[05:30:34] <cockatoodude> Oh, why would anyone draw code?
[05:30:46] <cockatoodude> Sounds VERY abstract and inefficient way of coding
[05:30:52] <TonyStone> IT IS!
[05:31:36] <TonyStone> lol!  I have a friend who insists on using it... and I am trying to help him "write" code to read a pipe but i am having trouble making a "readline" function
[05:31:56] <TonyStone> I honestly already want to smash my computer to pieces after playing with this thing.  hah
[05:32:15] <cockatoodude> I think abstraction is the worst thing to happen to computer science.... Aside from university computer science and academia based credentials and certificates.
[05:32:52] <InPhase> Abstraction is the foundation of good quality programming...
[05:33:09] <cockatoodude> It's a foundation for bloat
[05:33:22] <InPhase> Like if I were to pick one very broad concept to be the foundation of all quality in programming, abstraction would be it.
[05:33:33] <InPhase> It is basically the cornerstone of the entire field.
[05:33:35] <cockatoodude> Did you grow up in the 90's or early 2000's to think that?

[05:34:54] <InPhase> Well that would have been enough time to embrace abstraction.  lol
[05:34:56] <TonyStone> Well LabView was designed for "scientists" i think... so they could "whip" up something productive.  I think it is similar to matlab

[05:35:27] <InPhase> TonyStone: I've used LabView.  It "looks" cool but it's a serious pain to work with, and does not scale well at all.
[05:35:58] <cockatoodude> Well, I'd rather write a software suit in assembly than that
[05:36:05] <InPhase> TonyStone: It makes certain very simple things much easier to do for people with less of a programming background, and then it falls apart rapidly from there.
[05:36:17] <TonyStone> InPhase I agree... it has some cool concepts to it.  I wish my buddy would just move onto something else.  It makes me sick to my stomach watching him over a remote desktop "programming"   lol

[05:37:26] <InPhase> TonyStone: Most scientists should be converting their efforts to Python now.

[05:38:03] <cockatoodude> Haha
[05:38:12] <InPhase> TonyStone: There's a limit to how much complexity you can scale to with Python before the language design becomes a problem, but this limit is beyond what most light-programming scientists will ever hit.
[05:38:24] <TonyStone> I tried to get into Python years ago.... it didn't bring me any joy like Perl did back in the day... or Delphi on the desktop  :)
[05:38:55] <InPhase> TonyStone: I was a huge perl fan, but I've basically abandoned it (except for small things here and there) to reconsolidate that area on Python.
[05:39:00] <Rounin> Hm... I quite like Ruby... It has some of the simplicity of Python, but  it's a little more... fun, in the way Perl is
[05:39:09] <Rounin> More bells and whistles
[05:39:22] <cockatoodude> Python is great for writing the framework of a large end user software system, but for compute intensive tasks or operations you want C based library support for that, and if your OCD like me, you optimize that c lib with assembly
[05:39:34] <TonyStone> Yes perl was so awesome... i could whip up almost anything in minutes... (quick tasks and automation etc)
[05:39:57] <InPhase> There's no point to doing anything in C in 2022.  Any time you want performance you can simply grab C++ and get the same performance as C, but with modern features and safeguards for robustness.
[05:40:03] <ejjfunky> Rounin: wonder why Ruby isn't as popular as Python.
[05:40:33] <Rounin> ejjfunky: Hmm... It might be newer than Python, so that could be a thing

[05:40:47] <TonyStone> I also love Laz and FPC today because I can very quickly build quality stuff or quickly build one off experiments.
[05:41:14] <InPhase> You can still drop down to assembly for small sections of C++ if you really need to, although the use-cases for that have dropped rapidly over the recent 10-15 years with optimizer advances.
[05:41:47] <InPhase> What I mostly use assembly for now is reading rather than writing, to check how well an optimizer did with a particular structure of code.

[05:46:06] <TonyStone> I think ASM is ridiculous!  I cant even understand how to be productive with it... i have watched some tutorials...  I have no interest in learning even the basics.  Not at this point anyway
[05:46:28] <InPhase> TonyStone: It's a different mindset behind it.
[05:46:56] <ski> it's good to know about assembler
[05:47:27] <cockatoodude> Actually, everything is converted from java, to JVM byte code, then to many other stages of android build specific languages or langauge extensions, before finally being a binary native package, which gets updated when you factory reset, delete caches, perform an update, or otherwise invoke a app optimize process
[05:47:40] <ski> can make you better appreciate and understand higher-level languages, and how compilers map them to lower levels
[05:47:55] <TonyStone> I *tried to optimize one of my programs by playing with the ASM before the linker... something like that.  I followed step by step tutorials... it made sense what was happening along the way.  Then i saw the ASM output from my compiler of my program and immediatley quit!  lol

[05:48:15] <InPhase> I think some assembly skill is pretty much mandatory for any professional general software engineer.  It shifts your understanding of what the computer is actually doing, and lets you dive deep into things like compiler output and actually see what's happening when you need to do this.

[06:02:14] <ejjfunky> cockatoodude, it's more of a market for programmers like me that wants everything optimized.
[06:03:03] <cockatoodude> Well, optimizing is important for my project because some of the devices I am planning to market, will be very very low end old devices
[06:03:45] <cockatoodude> Everything should be optimized though once the core code works and is stable
[06:04:14] <cockatoodude> But I want security and functionality just as much as optimization. Combining all 3, is a mission
[06:04:14] <ejjfunky> cockatoodude, i'm all for that too. i think there's a market there. i dont like these commercialization that people always buy things new and leave a ton of junks littering the world.
[06:04:39] <ejjfunky> cockatoodude, cool.
[06:05:06] <cockatoodude> The intention, is to sell devices at much lower costs than their competition, and with better software in all mannars
[06:05:12] <amigojapan> My wife's stupid iPhone has started to wake me up by buzzing which refuses to go away even tho I disabled it
[06:05:21] <cockatoodude> Apple sucks
[06:05:33] <ejjfunky> cockatoodude, you know what will be better? is to have an alternative os to android. so when google drops support to the old models, people can use the alternative.
[06:06:17] <Rounin> Hmmmmm... As long as people keep publishing their apps in the two major app stores and only there, what use will other OSes be, though
[06:06:33] <amigojapan> ejjfunky: is Google threatening to drop support?
[06:06:37] <cockatoodude> Well... Google doesn't need to support them. I can support them just fine. I have decades of experience and contribution to the Linux kernel, and 8 or 10 years experience working with Android
[06:06:40] <Rounin> One could make an OS more or less exactly compatible with Android and have the Google app store on it, but still
[06:06:53] <ejjfunky> amigojapan, on old phone models. they do it all the time
[06:07:05] <flakland> getting the OS installed is the only problem
[06:07:12] <cockatoodude> I have a full GNU/Linux + custom components platform, but that's for a different buisness and market
[06:07:44] <amigojapan> ejjfunky: how old are we talking about?
[06:08:01] <ejjfunky> anything that the current android os doesnt support.
[06:08:02] <cockatoodude> It works on Samsung Galaxy S serious 9 and above, and all Pixel devices, as well as select LG Moto devices
[06:08:12] <cockatoodude> Android OS supports everything
[06:08:19] <cockatoodude> It's Linux
[06:08:30] <cockatoodude> Other than minimum system requirements anyways
[06:08:40] <flakland> how do you install it
[06:08:43] <ejjfunky> well, i used to have a Samsung Galaxy Duo. I'm pretty sure it's not getting any support.

[08:45:26] <SrPx> kinda off-topic perhaps, but is there any way to make a quick chart of widely known data? for example, I'd like to see a plot of all countries GDP in function of time. couldn't find that with a quick google search
[08:45:54] <SrPx> would be amazing if there was a site or something where I could just choose the X axis and the Y axis from widely known datasets and it plots for me
[08:47:07] <random-jellyfish> SrPx kaggle.com ?

[08:48:34] <InPhase> SrPx: But it's not really possible to do something like "all countries over time" because the data just isn't that well-defined.  Countries come and go, and so you end up at some point having to insert some choices and reasoning.
[08:49:05] <InPhase> SrPx: If you have access to the data you want though, it's very easy to make arbitrary plots with Python, pandas, and matplotlib.
[08:49:12] <SrPx> kaggle looks really cool

[17:50:06] <absentia> this is basically the urn example they give
[17:50:14] <pyzozord> yeah, there is a whole paper on using this with magic the gathering
[17:50:15] <bEagle> but hey huge thanks to everyone involved, i'm really sorry my mistake was as elementary as a typo not even in the code
[17:50:26] <f843d0> bEagle: if we have N cards (e.g. 52), and M seeds (e.g. 4) of same population m (e.g. 13), then picking up a particular seed on first attempt is m / N = 1 / M.
[17:50:43] <bEagle> absentia, correct. now i can just call a custom function in google sheets instead of writing it out every time
[17:51:31] <KillerWasp> hello random barnacle guys
[17:51:32] <pyzozord> I'm still confused about what is binomial conefficient, even though it was explained to me using the Pascal's triangle

[17:52:49] <absentia> irc is an excellent ground for testing out psychological technology

[17:54:01] <absentia> bEagle: `function choose(n,k) { let r = 1; for (var i=1; i <= k; i++) { r *= (n+1-1)/i; } return r; }`

[18:21:05] <ProfSimm> DPA:  1 and 0 was just sample result. There's no 1 and 0 in the actual notation
[18:21:43] <f843d0> Should be even possible to avoid boolean operators I believe
[18:22:18] <ProfSimm> f843d0: you mean AND and OR?
[18:22:41] <ProfSimm> f843d0: you can, but in this notation they become so useful, it's good to have them. You can use them as both logical operators, AND as a ternary
[18:22:45] <DPA> As I understand it, (true,false) would be mapped to (1,0), right? I'd certainly sometimes mix it up and assume (false,true) and then tell it to a(0,1) instead of a(1,0)
[18:22:47] <deniska> you're literally arguing against logic :D

[18:30:24] <pikapika> Modern synthetic and modern analytical geometry have much in common, and may be grouped together under the common name "projective geometry." Each has advantages over the other. The continual direct viewing of figures as existing in space adds exceptional charm to the study of the former, but the latter has the advantage in this, that a well-established routine in a certain degree may outrun thought itself, and thereby aid

[18:35:54] <ProfSimm> I just realized if boolean operator produce closures, we don't need "if" statement at all.
[18:36:13] <ProfSimm> so not needing bool values, means not needing if statements. Accidental complexity eliminated. Win win
[18:36:48] <ProfSimm> Notonly that, but short circuiting is automatic, no extra logic needed
[18:36:59] <ProfSimm> Ffffuuu
[18:37:43] <inhahe__> can you give an example
[18:38:38] <ProfSimm> inhahe_:  well I did abov,e weren't you around. That's OK. So AND and OR get compiled to invoking 2-arg closures in a specific order. Boolean operators like == and < and > get compiled to these bool closures.
[18:39:05] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: so  this   let a = 5 > 10; gets compiled to a closure you call like:    let b = a(1, 2)  // b = 2
[18:39:40] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: you can type the same thing like this:   let b = a && 1 || 2
[18:39:46] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: same as ternary

[18:51:17] <DPA> A natural word is a very difficult thing. It's not just some thing, action, etc. A word can contain information about time, status, feeling, views, relation, opinion, etc. A whole conceptual idea. And they may mean different things in different contexts.
[18:51:17] <DPA> Different cultures & languages may have completely different concepts, ideas, and ways to view things. So a thing in one language can always never be translated perfectly to another. At most, an attempt can be made to preserve information, meaning, wording, or some other aspect as good as possible.

[20:52:55] <DPA> Logic isn't simple at all. Sure, applying logic operations is simple. But reasoning about boolean logic, boolean algebra, can be very complicated. Just look at 3SAT, for example.
[20:52:55] <DPA> Algebra is such a jerk. It's a structure defining precisely how everything is connected, so with any known relations / values, you could figure out all still possible other values. But whenever it'd be useful, it's too complex to rearrange the equations, or it'd take too much memory...

[23:22:16] <nomagno> if you reserve the ENTIRE memory space for orderly, ONLY-automatic, ONLY-scoped memory allocation, whenever you make a function call that function's local variables get written right next to the last function's memory space, with a marker.

[23:23:11] <ProfSimm> Decker: yes and no

[23:24:01] <Decker> ProfSimm eventually at the end of the chain you have a 'continue main'
[23:24:10] <Decker> or 'do anything else'
[23:24:16] <EdFletcher> juliaEnv: well that's kind of two different questions: a new architecture isn't generally necessary to solve a performance problem and most certainly isn't where you'd start. in that case yeah you'd start with perf tests, isolating the "hot spots" where perf is specifically bad and then optimizing those specifically. 
[23:24:19] <nomagno> Much cleaner than the current approach where memory allocation is explicit and freeing not automatic
[23:24:45] <Decker> even if it's 1 entry because the returns evaporate from one to the next for ( f(g(h(x))) eventually h returns to (here))

[23:43:39] <Decker> ProfSimm it's also promises/async, 'await' never actually awaits, it returns a promise... eventually what it's waiting on gets fullfilled which triggers its own then, which is really the rest of the function wrapped in a callback 
[23:44:36] <ProfSimm> Decker: sure
[23:44:50] <ProfSimm> Decker: the trick to me is how to write CPS, but make it no look like CPS
[23:44:56] <Decker> which in a completed loop would be 'return eventLoop' :) or soemthing.... in NanoRTOS I called it Relinquish() with a tick count or -1 for forever... in a coop system it's just a call to the next thing which swaps the functional stack/state
[23:45:08] <ProfSimm> Decker: await doesn't count. That hides the benefits of CPS
[23:45:39] <ProfSimm> Decker: BTW the native await just awaits actually. The execution can be suspended in the scope
[23:46:04] <Decker> no.
[23:46:18] <ProfSimm> Spaghetti stack?
[23:46:18] <Decker> not in JS if you refer to your own language sure
[23:46:37] <Decker> yes.  Like I said the return path becomes like a separate call path

[23:51:36] <Decker> ProfSimm but it needs its own frame.... you can still kill the old one but; part of the syntax has to be either 1) what to keep from the caller's args automatically would be nice

[23:51:56] <ProfSimm> Decker: let's assume I keep everything.
[23:52:01] <Decker> assuming the caller had those same args, which probably it should because it should implement some chain interface for the types of chains it belongs in
[23:52:01] <user51> does anyone else treat pointers as two things, the pointer itself and what it points to?
[23:52:08] <Decker> (audio filters don't work on images for example)
[23:52:24] <Decker> user51 it is...
[23:52:30] <Decker> that's what makes it different from an array
[23:52:38] <Decker> which is just the thing pointed to
[23:53:09] <user51> well, my head just went boom. damned abstractions..
[23:54:21] <user51> i realized this as i was working on a tree, on paper. i was making nodes, but did not consider the contents.
[23:54:41] <ProfSimm> Decker: I think I might need to have some "return result" sugar for simple lamdbas, which internally uses some CPS convention. Otheriwse nesting expression would be a nightmare
