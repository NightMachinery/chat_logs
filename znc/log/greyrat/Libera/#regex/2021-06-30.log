[08:15:38] <JohnDoe2> lexers tokenize based on regexes but you can pop in and out of states (for example you hit a * you enter the bold state and keep eating stuff, adjust other states until you hit the next * that will exit bold state)

[10:10:29] <re101-dodo-32> atleast that's what i thought. but it seems it will be difficult
[10:10:40] <Me-me> Very difficult, yes. There are thousands of rules here.
[10:10:56] <re101-dodo-32> so i guess i will just settle on a few basic ones
[10:11:02] <Me-me> Okay. What ones?
[10:11:16] <re101-dodo-32> bold, italics , list and header 
[10:11:58] <Me-me> And how do those rules go?

[10:18:52] <digitok> re101-dodo-32, your current regex doesn't match _ because of (?<!\w_)
[10:19:01] <digitok> wait, nvm
[10:19:32] <digitok> it's matching foo*bar* but you don't want foo_bar_ to match?

[10:26:38] <digitok> is  _foo_bar_.  valid?

[10:39:47] <re101-dodo-32> can you make a special case for it . i mean like using OR 
[10:40:00] <digitok> the thing is, your regex is only going to match it once anyway

[10:40:22] <digitok> either way the markup will be wrong

[12:24:17] <digitok> how so
[12:24:29] <digitok> i didn't make anything
[12:28:09] <purplex> i mean our regexes were same this time!
[12:28:53] <digitok> it's your regex :)
[12:29:56] <purplex> i see, copy.. its okay you get the thank you hehe
[12:30:38] <digitok> i was just pointing out an error :>
[12:31:45] <purplex> opps $ one moment
[12:32:25] <digitok> that's one of them :p
[12:33:46] <purplex> https://regex101.com/r/0eIm4y/3 interesting can't see any other
[12:34:15] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/0eIm4y/4
[12:35:18] <purplex> of course, there don't have to be two dots!
[12:35:40] <purplex> "only dots" made me think of that was condition
[12:36:12] <digitok> we also don't know if "a.." is valid
[12:36:52] <purplex> https://regex101.com/r/0eIm4y/5
[12:37:32] <purplex> so it can zero, one or two dots?
[12:37:52] <digitok> i assume so
[12:38:07] <digitok> but we don't have any examples
[12:39:56] <re101-civet-68> regex can allow alphabets ,numbers and only 2 dots and no special characters i allowed
[12:40:09] <digitok> cool
[12:40:25] <purplex> lol
[12:42:52] <purplex> https://regex101.com/r/0eIm4y/6 only two dots and numbers and letters

[12:45:09] <purplex> that is allowed
[12:45:19] <purplex> i suppose..
[12:45:59] <purplex> but last one isn't
[12:46:23] <digitok> it isn't?
[12:47:56] <purplex> https://regex101.com/r/0eIm4y/10
[12:48:12] <purplex> ayy44445 seems ok
[12:48:44] <digitok> is empty string valid
[12:48:52] <digitok> (we don't know)
[12:49:25] <purplex> i'll say not valid, yes we know
[12:49:31] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/0eIm4y/11

[12:54:00] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/0eIm4y/14
[12:55:46] <digitok> so we're basically at /5 with some slight changes
[12:57:37] <digitok> although /13 was correct for only 2 dots (not 1)
[12:57:43] <digitok> forgot we changed that rule

[19:19:29] <purplex> for my case :p
[19:19:31] <digitok> lol
[19:21:27] <purplex> wait no i will need ?! i think
[19:22:33] <koollman> digitok: ok... that regex is pretty neat. so, lookahead for each character category required, without 'consuming' them. I was thinking of way worse solutions
[19:26:22] <purplex> you can share a working solution even if it worse
[19:59:50] <Timvde> Note that it is bad practice to have these kind of requirements for passwords
[19:59:58] <Timvde> It violates the NIST guidelines
[20:01:56] <Timvde> Verifiers SHALL require subscriber-chosen memorized secrets to be at least 8 characters in length. [...] Verifiers SHOULD NOT impose other composition rules (e.g., requiring mixtures of different character types or prohibiting consecutively repeated characters) for memorized secrets.
[20:26:47] <digitok> so you're saying the regex needs another condition

[20:38:09] <Timvde> No, I'm saying it should be /.{8}/
[20:38:31] <Timvde> (or actually: len(password) > 8, no need to use regex)

[20:45:56] <purplex> how do we know he is using it for password?

[21:24:50] <re101-zorse-64> I want that RegEx to skip what is between the `<` and `>` tags as well as whatever begins with a `-` (hyphen)
[21:24:55] <re101-zorse-64> Please help!
[21:30:15] <digitok> how many matches should there be in your example
[21:37:45] <re101-zorse-64> many have the < and > but those should be skipped
[21:38:10] <re101-zorse-64> ...but the RegEx should find the rest
[21:38:52] <digitok> which is how many
[21:41:44] <re101-zorse-64> I don't know how many but there may be more than 20 such tags - all with different strings
[21:42:05] <digitok> i can see 0
[21:42:23] <digitok> show me one
[21:42:39] <re101-zorse-64> `<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
[21:42:40] <re101-zorse-64>       style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";mso-fareast-font-family:
[21:42:40] <re101-zorse-64>       "Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:black'>`
[21:43:12] <digitok> i can see 0 there
[21:44:14] <re101-zorse-64> in that, whatever is between <p class................color:black'> should be skipped
[21:44:43] <digitok> that's the whole thing
[21:45:37] <re101-zorse-64> In `<td width=642 valign=top style='width:481.5pt;border:solid #BFDBFF 1.0pt;
[21:45:38] <re101-zorse-64>       mso-border-alt:solid #BFDBFF .75pt;padding:3.75pt 3.75pt 3.75pt 3.75pt'>` the hyphen in `mso-border-alt` shud be skipped
[21:46:20] <digitok> yes, so we're at 0 so far
[21:46:39] <re101-zorse-64> In `<tr style='mso-yfti-irow:5'>` the hyphen in `mso-yfti-irow` should be skipped 
[21:46:51] <digitok> ok, still at 0
[21:46:56] <digitok> when will you show me one that should match?
[21:47:16] <re101-zorse-64> Oh
[21:47:21] <re101-zorse-64> Here `genitalia-Pain`
[21:47:39] <re101-zorse-64> and `Female genitalia-Prolapsed`
[21:47:59] <re101-zorse-64> and `Sleep-Moaning`
[21:48:34] <digitok> ok, so there are 2 things wrong with that
[21:48:53] <re101-zorse-64> the strings between the `<` and `>` shud be skipped
[21:49:12] <digitok> your regex only looks for lowercase chars
[21:49:19] <re101-zorse-64> yes
[21:49:32] <digitok> so why should those match
[21:49:45] <re101-zorse-64> it matches the first 2
[21:49:51] <digitok> no
[21:49:56] <re101-zorse-64> but also whatever is in the tags
[21:50:19] <digitok> "a-P" is not 2 lowercase chars
[21:50:44] <re101-zorse-64> but Notepa++ finds it
[21:51:14] <digitok> ok, so you also want to match uppercase chars, and you're using case insensitivity
[21:51:23] <re101-zorse-64> yep
[21:51:27] <digitok> so the next thing that's wrong
[21:51:39] <digitok> all of those lines begin with -
[21:51:50] <digitok> didn't you say those should be skipped?
[21:52:24] <re101-zorse-64> so that's why I put the [a-z] at the start of the find field also
[21:52:40] <re101-zorse-64> that helps skip those
[21:52:58] <digitok> ok, so you didn't mean the line shouldn't start with -, but the word
[21:53:25] <re101-zorse-64> I thot my English was good
[21:53:40] <digitok> it's great
[21:53:45] <re101-zorse-64> I want to skip the hyphens that start the line
[21:54:03] <digitok> and i assume you don't want to remove the letters, just add spaces
[21:54:24] <re101-zorse-64> ...as well as those in the tags I typed above
[21:54:32] <digitok> right, i took that as skipping the whole line
[21:54:34] <re101-zorse-64> yes
[21:54:41] <digitok> my mistake
[21:54:58] <re101-zorse-64> not whole line
[21:55:34] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/fYSQxz/2
[21:57:12] <re101-zorse-64> Terrific

[21:58:10] <digitok> you should hire a web developer
[21:58:19] <digitok> i think the next one won't fleece you
[21:58:27] <re101-zorse-64> I've been fleeced
[21:58:41] <digitok> i know, but the next one won't
[21:59:12] <re101-zorse-64> .....but I have been doing the designing and editing text just fine
[21:59:27] <re101-zorse-64> I've tried 5 people
[21:59:42] <digitok> all fleeced?
[22:00:08] <re101-zorse-64> The last one said he's an SEO expert and fleeced me more but all he did was add some keywords using google trends
[22:00:28] <re101-zorse-64> Luckily, he showed me what he did
[22:00:46] <re101-zorse-64> So, I thot I ought to save some money
[22:00:57] <re101-zorse-64> My dotter has to go to College next yr
[22:01:26] <digitok> hire me, i'll do the regex, you do the rest
[22:01:35] <digitok> so just like what we do now
[22:01:45] <re101-zorse-64> OK, I don't mind
[22:02:11] <re101-zorse-64> How do I contact you?
[22:02:49] <digitok> just join this channel
[22:03:22] <re101-zorse-64> OK, thanks digitok
