[00:54:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: I'm not so sure. I think that view is only workable in a world where you can expect websites to work
[00:54:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: And thus, when a website doesn't do what you expected, you go "hm, my mental model of the designed behavior is incomplete/inaccurate, what's going on? aha, it must be <whatever>"
[00:54:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> But that's not the reality! In reality the usual answer is "shit be broken lol"
[00:55:09] <gwern> ggreer: 'Lee said Selectboard Chairman Russell Edwards told him to turn over all police items including his badges, the keys to his police cruiser and his uniform “immediately.” Following the meeting, Lee said he took off his uniform and — wearing only briefs, a T-shirt, a gray baseball cap and a shirt — started the 7-mile walk home to Newport on Tuesday evening. Lee said that as he...
[00:55:15] <gwern> ...was undressing, Edwards told him to turn in his uniform on a later day, but he declined. “This is what they demanded and this is what I’m doing,” he said in the interview. Lee walked a little less than a mile in 26-degree temperatures until his wife picked him up, he said.' <-- one of us one of us one of us

[00:58:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: I would say that the correct way to implement *the current behavior* (as opposed to the proposed version of the behavior, i.e. having a query parameter) would be to have an indicator on the redirected-to page about what has happened. For instance, consider https://wiki.obormot.net/PmWiki/WikiGroups
[00:58:47] <Robomot> Wiki Group — OborWiki
[00:59:13] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: yeah, but Arxiv wouldn't go for it, presumably. they'd come up with any excuse to make ar5iv or ar5iv users do all the work
[00:59:25] * Obormot\Arcturus shrug
[00:59:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Perhaps. I can't speak to that, but that'd be the right way...

[01:00:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Point is, it isn't fair to blame e.g. Jess Riedel ... you go to a website, you see otherwise than the promised behavior - natural conclusion you jump to? Shit be broken
[01:00:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> 9 times out of 10, at the least, you are right...
[01:00:42] <ggreer> libertarians are uncool but a lot of their positions eventually get adopted. back in the 70s they were in favor of gay marriage, marijuana legalization, and fewer firearms restrictions. since then, all of those have come to pass
[01:01:16] <mst> of course it's NH
[01:01:42] <gwern> ggreer: other positions have not fared so well, like age of consent or NAMBLA
[01:02:23] <gwern> (whether that's more or less vindication by posterity than other fringe-but-not-too-fringe ideologies, I couldn't say)
[01:02:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Less than progressivism, it seems to me
[01:03:20] <mst> this is why, as a left liberaltarian, I consider all of my political opinions to be 100% vindicated and immune to criticism, yes
[01:03:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indeed it's not easy to find positioned championed by libertarians, that were later adopted, and that weren't also, and earlier, championed by progressives
[01:03:50] <gwern> there certainly are a lot of people in the world, this is true
[01:04:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> *positions championed
[01:06:44] <ggreer> Obormot\Arcturus: charter schools. gun rights
[01:10:16] <zebrask> I don't have a great sense of how political positions have shifted over time, but my instinct is that libertarians would have advocated for the general deregulation of transportation and such that went on in the 80s and that progressives would not have been advocating that.
[01:11:58] <adiabatic> zebrask: Ted Kennedy was a big supporter of airline deregulation. he wondered why intra-state (CA) flights were way cheaper than similar-distance flights cross-state and wanted that gone
[01:14:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: Not sure the charter schools we have are quite the charter schools libertarians wanted...
[01:14:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gun rights... have those *increased*??
[01:17:11] <ggreer> yes. in the 70s concealed carry was pretty much banned everywhere
[01:17:24] <ggreer> in the 90s there was the assault weapon ban
[01:18:34] <ggreer> the only big thing that's been restricted since the 70s is the machine gun registry
[01:22:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Fair enough, gun rights sounds like an example then, yeah
[01:26:01] <ggreer> also free speech rights have improved. the biggest win was the crypto wars of the 90s
[01:26:17] <adiabatic> > also free speech rights have improved
[01:26:19] <zebrask> adiabatic: Was that a standard progressive thing, or his idiosyncratic pet project?
[01:26:29] <adiabatic> zebrask: pet project
[01:26:32] <two2thehead> ggreer, oh god
[01:26:41] <two2thehead> the nineties were terrible for crypto
[01:26:58] <zebrask> Yeah, that's at least more consistent with my sense of the political positions at the time.
[01:27:21] <ggreer> we came very close to having cryptography banned from civilian use (or at least backdoored)

[04:55:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Having run into Stella Parks's penchant for ludicrously sweet desserts, I reduced the sugar slightly from the recipe (by maybe a couple tbsp), and that was actually a mistake; they came out a tad under-sweetened (but still quite good); so next time I'd make them with the sugar amount as given.

[08:33:56] <quanticle> gwern: Re: Ukrainian GDP, the trouble with Ukraine is that it had all of the corruption and useless industrial projects of the Russia, but without any of the offsetting natural resources.
[08:36:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> That can't be right
[08:36:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ukraine has tooons of natural resources
[08:36:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indeed that's one of the big draws of invading it
[08:36:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Big ol' piles of strategically important resources
[08:37:19] <quanticle> What natural resources does Ukraine have except for lots and lots of black dirt?
[08:38:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Significant natural resources in Ukraine include iron ore, coal, manganese, natural gas, oil, salt, sulphur, graphite, titanium, magnesium, kaolin, nickel, mercury, timber and an abundance of arable land."
[08:39:06] <PapuaHardyNet> wow. I'd take over Ukraine too if I could
[08:39:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Ukraine is rich in mineral deposits, including iron ore (of which it once produced 50 percent of the entire Soviet output), manganese ore (of which it produced 40 percent of world output during the Soviet era), mercury, titanium,[124] and nickel."
[08:39:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In 2019, the country was the 7th largest world producer of iron ore,[119] the world's 8th largest producer of manganese,[120] 6th largest producer of titanium,[121] and 7th largest producer worldwide of graphite.[122] It was the world's 9th largest producer of uranium in 2018.[123]"
[08:40:01] <quanticle> Huh. I knew about the uranium and titanium, but I didn't realize it was responsible for a significant proportion of the Soviets' iron production.
[08:40:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Ukraine is one of the world's most important mineral producing countries, in terms of both the range and size of its reserves. There are nearly 8,000 separate deposits, harboring some 90 different minerals, of which about 20 are economically significant. About half of all the known deposits are under exploitation. Coal reserves in Ukraine amount to 47.1 billion tons. The annual domestic demand for coal as fuel is about 100
[08:40:11] <Obormot\Arcturus>  million tons, of which 85 percent can be satisfied by domestic production. Ukraine has oil and gas fields that meet 10 percent of her oil and 20 percent of her gas consumption, respectively. Ukraine contains natural gas reserves of 39.6 trillion cubic feet, but only about 20 percent of the country's demand is met by domestic production. Deposits of iron ore (estimated at 28 billion tons), manganese ore (3 billion tons), chalk
[08:40:11] <Obormot\Arcturus>  and limestone (1.5 billion tons) are also large in Ukraine. The domestic industrial sector suffers from constant energy shortages and energy supply payment debts totaling about $792 million at the end of 1995."

[17:28:39] <feep[work]> today in ttf fonts
[17:28:52] <feep[work]> reasonable kerning offsets include values such as: -60
[17:28:59] <feep[work]> unreasonable kerning offsets: -760...
[17:29:37] <two2thehead> so what, if any, is the logic behind those values?
[17:29:59] <feep[work]> well, -60 is like ... if you have Ta for instance, you want a to be moved slightly left so that it can fit slightly inside the T's bounding box
[17:30:20] <two2thehead> with you so far
[17:30:20] <feep[work]> if you put -760 instead, it looks more like aT
[17:30:25] <two2thehead> ah
[17:30:28] <two2thehead> feep[work], +1
[17:30:56] <feep[work]> and that's why some train displays had "corrupted font display"~
[17:31:09] <two2thehead> at first glance, a part of me would be annoyed at such complexity being available, but I can see how specialists may need it
[17:31:26] <feep[work]> yeah with fonts, almost every combination of letters is kerned
[17:31:52] <feep[work]> though for consoles, you used fixed-width fonts, so instead you design your characters to fit the full width available instead, so it still looks good
[17:32:04] <feep[work]> if you tried using a variable-width font in a fixed-width display, it'd look ugly af
[17:32:21] <feep[work]> because there'd be weird random spaces between characters
[17:32:56] <feep[work]> .. which I am realizing is unrelated to kerning, which is even cleverer, so nvm XD
[17:33:34] <two2thehead> so what was the cause of the train display error?
[17:34:13] <feep[work]> two2thehead: it wasn't even Ta, it was Tä, which is rare enough that I think the font designers missed it and mistranscribed the kerning data
[17:34:33] <two2thehead> huh
[17:34:44] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a mildly interesting, above
[17:34:47] <feep[work]> the message we were putting out had "Täglich", so it ended up looking like "ägTlich", with g and T smushed together
[17:35:11] <feep[work]> because it was continuing with correct kerning after ä, which had left-drifted
[17:35:58] <two2thehead> oh, I see. They did the 'reverse the word' thing you see on some public transit displays
[17:36:00] <feep[work]> two2thehead: that said, Ta is a good example of kerning if you want to see it
[17:36:15] <feep[work]> two2thehead: grab something like libreoffice writer, pick a very large font size, and write Ta
[17:36:45] <feep[work]> two2thehead: you will see that for instance in Liberation Sans, the a slightly penetrates into the T's bounding box
[17:36:49] <two2thehead> i don't have libre on my box right now
[17:36:54] <two2thehead> hm
[17:36:56] <feep[work]> any editor will do really
[17:37:03] <feep[work]> (that has font selection)
[17:37:38] <two2thehead> I'll do it at a later time
[17:37:51] <feep[work]> because 'a' is a half-height letter, and T is pretty empty towards the bottom
[17:38:02] <feep[work]> so if they were unkerned, it would look like there was a lot of space between them
[17:38:22] <two2thehead> hm
[17:38:52] <feep[work]> another similar example is Y,
[17:39:00] <feep[work]> where the comma slightly drifts into the Y's business
[17:45:14] <feep[work]> ah, possibly the best example: VA
[17:46:01] <feep[work]> if that was unkerned, it'd almost look like V A, with like half a space between them
[17:46:11] <feep[work]> cause you'd have the top part of the V pushing aside the bottom part of the A
[17:47:17] <PapuaHardyNet> are terminals unkerned?
[17:47:20] <PapuaHardyNet> I think they are
[17:47:22] <feep[work]> yes
[17:47:31] <feep[work]> but again, terminals use fixed-width fonts, which are designed for being used unkerned

Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Psychical Society, an ASPR splinter group led by vehement debunker Joseph Rinn, announced a $10,000 prize for the contents of the apocryphal letter. This bounty provoked fifty mediums to answer Rinn’s call. “The

[23:46:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> > In order to establish the role that education plays in shaping earnings inside organized crime organizations, we follow the long tradition of Mincer-type regressions, estimated with OLS. The main drawback of this approach is the possibility of ability bias- that an omitted variable, such as unobserved ability, may be correlated with both log income and years of education. Our datasets do not allow us to utilize the IV
[23:46:30] <Obormot\Arcturus>  approaches common in the literature, as outlined in the Literature Review section. However, we believe that the bias should be similar for the mobster sample and for the comparison samples of neighbors, Italians, second-generation Italians, U.S.-born and U.S.-citizen men. The existing literature has shown that OLS estimates are mostly biased downwards relative to those found using IV methods, so our results below may be
[23:46:30] <Obormot\Arcturus>  considered lower bound estimates. We thus interpret our reported returns to education as reflecting both the true return to schooling and the component that reflects the fact that ability is correlated with years of schooling attained.
[23:47:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Amazing, truly. "We didn't control for the obvious confounder, instead we're just going to assume that the effect was from the variable we care about, because, uh... because."
