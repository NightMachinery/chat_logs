[00:17:14] <int-e> Hmm let's ask this a bit more abstractly... when can we write a function on (0,1) as the sum of a decreasing function and an increasing function?
[00:18:15] <int-e> (For the "negative part" I intend to negate the negative of the two functions and take logarithms, so the multiplication becomes addition which is easier to think about)
[00:20:18] <int-e> And the intuition is that you can collect the increasing intervals in the increasing function and the decreasing intervals in the decreasing function, leaving the other function constant for that interval. But that doesn't cope with functions that switch between increasing and decreasing infinitely often.
[00:20:22] <isekaijin> My actual f and g are f(x) = x and g(x) = x^n + k, where n is odd and k is a positive constant. Then x^2 * h(x) is the derivative of a function whose graph I am hoping looks like this: https://i.imgur.com/lQQOmGE.png .

[02:17:58] <int-e> You can't reduce A_{TM} to L, intuitively because that would require you to map non-terminating <M,w> (a non-element of A_{TM}) to a *terminating* M' (a non-element of L), but you cannot detect non-termination of M on a given input.

[04:38:44] <sek> MrsSmith: what's wrong with being an algebraic geometer
[04:39:47] <sek> XCode: anyway yes, an abelian surface does not embed in P3 either - it'd have to be a hypersurface and you can check (eg by computing some cohomology) that a hypersurface in P3 can't be abelian
[04:40:14] <XCode> sek: Sorry. I should be more careful with my words. Elliptic curves can be embedded in P^2 not surface.
[04:40:30] <sek> on the other hand, every projective surface embeds in P5
[04:40:32] <sek> ah
[04:40:58] <sek> the intersection of two quadric in P^3 is an elliptic curve
[04:41:36] <XCode> sek: so the upper bound is P^5 I guess so it is either P4 or P5.
[04:41:50] <isekaijin> Okay, I have managed to trim down my problem to the following. Let p be a prime number >= 5, and let G be a subgroup of S_p that is generated by a p-cycle and an element of order 2 that fixes *exactly* three elements. Can I show that G is not solvable?
[04:41:57] <sek> idk how much you know about linear systems but basically if you look at the linear system given by 4*pt it induces an embedding in P^3 as the intersection of two quadrics
[04:42:02] <sek> you can check this with Riemann-Roch
[04:42:22] <sek> XCode: well every projective curve embeds in P3
[04:42:25] <XCode> sek: it is just I am working towards something that needs certain counting argument on number of the zeroes for quadratic equation on the abelian surface.
[04:42:47] <sek> I am confused, are you asking about embeddings of abelian surfaces or elliptic curves
[04:43:06] <XCode> abelian surfaces as generalization for product of elliptic curves.
[04:43:31] <XCode> sek: it is just I have a project completed for elliptic curves and I am wondering how can I generalize it for general product of abelian surfaces.
[04:43:42] <MrsSmith> sek: because it's too easy you just have to learn how to draw commutative diagrams and what a category is. I took it as an undergrad in my second year. Anyone can publish in AG if you know the basics

[06:19:28] <qergle> no, i computed the integral
[06:19:45] <droid3> Which very very slow but its three steps search/enumerate all subgroups of the group, 2) find all normal series given all these subgroups found in first step  3) check all these normal series that the chain of factor groups fi/fi+1 is abeilan in at least one of the normal series. If so it stops and prints solvable group other wise it prints not solvable.

[06:27:18] <kluk> qergle see if this question makes sense
[06:27:58] <kluk> The gist algorithm I linked has a so-called Horner's method with a bunch of magical numbers. I hand-checked them and they are correct. nonetheless that algorithm generates unique results, for instance, it does not generate the correct number you gave me for 130
[06:28:22] <kluk> It's just a very elusive situation that even after I hand-check the algorithm it still spits out different numbers
[06:28:59] <kluk> I just don't know what to think of when I get two normdist algorithms on my machine, plus R, giving me 2 different results total, both different from the most popular numbers online
[06:29:18] <kluk> Could it be Excel's normdist was incorrect and led to the proliferation of the incorrect numbers?
[06:29:20] <cherim> Your gist does not even attempt to produce answers with machine precision
[06:29:30] <kluk> Perhaps there's an alternative to Horner's method that Excel uses that gives it an error?
[06:29:31] <cherim> It explicitly promises "fractional error less than 1.2 * 10 ^ -7." in comments
[06:29:40] <droid3> ya the problem for me is there is no proper algorithmic way to code up how to compute a galosis group in general. If one can do that or if one knows of an algorithmic method /code to do that.
[06:30:02] <cherim> You should not trust it with anything beyond 1.2e-7 precision
[06:30:05] <kluk> cherim I suppose because the magic numbers are too truncated?
[06:30:08] <droid3> Then i could just supply the group to my already written code and compute if any polynomial is solvable by radicals or not.

[06:35:15] <cherim> There are methods to compute to arbitrarily many digits -- say, that is how wolframalpha got all the digits qergle posted

[06:35:33] <kluk> Hmm... I'm not so sure. See I know this is IQ related but it's because it's the easiest material I can find online. I will be calculating english words rarities and I need more precision than 7 digits

[06:36:30] <droid3> So tonights on galosis theory for this program i am working on
[06:36:45] <cherim> If you want cheap functions with more precision, you'd have to get more terms in the fit (more magic numbers), and more digits in each magic number
[06:36:56] <kluk> oh!
[06:36:57] <kluk> I see now
[06:37:11] <cherim> Or you can compute from known asymptotic expansions
[06:37:25] <droid3> I dont see if a approach it from the other side looking at fields instead of groups that it would help much in determining if the galosis group is solvable either.
[06:37:52] <droid3> For a general algorithm
[06:37:57] <kluk> cherim I see! I get it now. When you said more terms in the fit, that helped me understand the code now
[06:38:17] <droid3> Maybe it doesnt exist a general algorithm just was curious if anybody knew.
[06:38:50] <kluk> cherim okay so we are on the same page as to how I can make those numbers myself, thank you. do you have any ideas as to how people online and in books are getting different results? do you think it could be the specific truncation used by Excel's normdist?
[06:39:04] <kluk> seemingly excel's normdist is what people in books and online use to talk about these things
[06:39:05] <droid3> I can approach if with groups or with fields thanks to the fundamental theorem of galosis theory

[07:47:28] <memorye> in the monty hall problem what makes the two initially equally likely possiblities become not equally likely is the paring down of one of them to one of two ways it could go, while the other is not pared down, as it only had one way it could go. Are there any other ways for an initially equally likely pair to have their probablities become unequal? like some other principle entirely that would do it?

[07:55:09] <laurus> memorye: I think you need to be more clear about how you write down that problem, to understand it better.
[07:55:21] <laurus> memorye: I mean, using probabilities.
[07:56:23] <memorye> well the clearest way is a diagram right?
[07:56:25] <memorye> a graph
[07:56:33] <memorye> a tree diagram with branches having area
[07:56:44] <memorye> is the clearest way
[07:56:55] <laurus> memorye: No, I mean writing down P(events)
[07:56:56] <memorye> way more clear than a formula
[07:57:03] <laurus> Have you studied probability before?
[07:57:09] <memorye> yeah you label the branches on the tree

[07:58:22] <laurus> greenbagels: I see. Someone in an amazon.com book review mentioned that one book "only covers linear functional analysis" which is what got me wondering. I know nothing about the topics (yet)
[07:58:23] <greenbagels> ive had profs describe FA to me as "infinite dimensional linear algebra"; not sure if they were trying to dumb it down or what, but i cant imagine people make a useful distinction between the two?

[07:59:49] <laurus> memorye: Well for this Monty Hall problem you can try writing down the probabilities of the specific events, which will help you understand what is going on here
[08:00:15] <memorye> yeah i undderstand the monty hall problem . its just that i am trying to solve a different problem
[08:00:40] <memorye> and i need another way for two initially equally likely probabilities to become unequal on the learning of new info.
[08:00:51] <memorye> that is not just basically the same as
[08:01:04] <memorye>  or a generalization of the priniciple in the monty hall problem
[08:01:20] <laurus> memorye: you need to explictly clarify what "learning new info" means, and you should be able to do that if you have a working knowledge of probability
[08:01:47] <memorye> yeah but i was hoping somene might have something in mind already so i wouldnt have to.
[08:02:49] <memorye> so you can have an uncertain memory. and that would, instead of removing the credence from some branch of the tree , merely shrink it, but thats still basically the same principle. and i guess since alll learning is going to be shrinking or growing of credence maybe thats all there is
[08:03:10] <memorye> well i dont want to say that yet
[08:03:19] <memorye>  but i see the sense in that

[08:12:07] <mycroftiv> memorye: here is a paradox you may like. inside ZFC, the real numbers are uncountable. yet if ZFC is consistent, there is a model of ZFC where the entire model is countable, including the reals and the powerset of the reals and larger infinities.
[08:12:08] <memorye> yeah i need to change that
[08:13:10] <memorye> realy i didnt know that. i only know like the beginning of NF with urelements
[08:13:11] <mycroftiv> this is skolem's paradox and it is a result of the fact that first order theories cant control the cardinality of their models and have a countable model if they have any infinite model
[08:13:35] <memorye> oh
[08:14:22] <memorye> oops i should have said" i didn't know that that sentence was true."
[08:14:25] <mycroftiv> starting from a countable model you can also do cohen forcing and change the cardinality of the real numbers in a new model that keeps all the ordinals the same
[08:14:33] <memorye> not" i didnt know that."

[08:20:33] <ProfSimm> They all have components that emit synchronizing impulses, and once they establish a common local "clock rate", they switch to information exchange: impulse is 1, and lack of impulse is 0. Parkinson is a condition where cells lost the ability to sync. Maybe they can't emit strong impulses anymore, or lost the ability to be excited by them.

[10:22:01] <isekaijin> Since p is prime, G is not just transitive, but actually primitive. By this, I mean that, if X = {a_1, ..., a_p} is the set of roots of f(X), then the only partitions of X that G respects are the trivial ones: the partition into singletons, and the “unpartition”.

[10:36:20] <isekaijin> But I am not sure about the case where there are several pairs of complex conjugate roots. We need an argument that somehow breaks when there is just one real root, so it has to be more subtle than anything I have tried so far.

[10:42:39] <savask> isekaijin: If G was solvable, it would be a subgroup of AGL(1, p) (Burnside's theorem), it's a semidirect product of Z_p and Z_(p-1) (multiplicative group)
[10:43:10] <savask> So the stabilizer of any two points is the identity, while in your situation complex conjugation stabilizes two points (and it's not identity)

[10:47:33] <savask> isekaijin: You can do it in an elementary way, using your previous idea. If G is solvable, take a minimal normal subgroup N of G. Then N is transitive, hence has order p, so G is the normalizer of a p-cycle. It seems that it's more or less clear that complex conjugation (which is a product of several transpositions and has at least 2 fixed points) cannot normalize a p-cycle

[10:59:02] <savask> An intuitive answer would be because a product of n transpositions can "flip" the cycle (1, 2, ... p) around the middle, essentially inverting it
[10:59:26] <savask> While if there are less than n transpositions, at least 2 points will have to stay so no "flipping"
[10:59:54] <isekaijin> Mmm.

[13:38:41] <jmorris> that makes more sense
[13:38:42] <JimmyRustles> it's like in dope wars, you can buy 10 units of cocaine in london for $10 and sell them for $20 in new york and make a profit
[13:39:20] <jmorris> i see
[13:39:34] <jmorris> well you choose the price based on how easily you want the player to profit

[15:03:31] <greenbagels> qergle: i think there's a misunderstanding
[15:03:32] <rubiksdream> *[0,pi/2]
[15:03:51] <greenbagels> i dont think cadmio thinks there's another k such that there exists a k-cycle with order 3
[15:03:52] <rubiksdream> uh wait, ive gone and confused myself
[15:03:58] <rubiksdream> i mean [0,pi], sorry
[15:04:03] <rubiksdream> keep forgetting its x/2 not x
[15:04:16] <rubiksdream> but yeah, i dont see this standard approach running into any problems
[15:04:31] <greenbagels> i think cadmio thinks there could be some other general element of S_4 with order 3, that isnt a 3-cycle
[15:04:45] <qergle> i don't mean another k-cycle, i mean any other cycle stucture (some order 3 element that's not a 3-cycle)
[15:05:03] <greenbagels> oh i see what you mean
[15:05:37] <W> rubiksdream, well I don't actually know any "standard approach" here, but I have fiddled enough with numeric Fourier transforms that I think I'll get it if I read up on it, which I'll go do now
[15:05:55] <rubiksdream> W the standard approach is just to compute the fourier coefficients
[15:06:10] <rubiksdream> which you do by computing an integral of cos(x/2)cos(kx)
[15:06:11] <W> yes, which I always do with a computer (and did in this case)
[15:06:16] <greenbagels> cadmio: hint: cycle decomposition
[15:06:30] <W> that I then notice the 4n^2-1 pattern is kind of a coincidence, see
[15:07:16] <qergle> qergle think if cadmio tries to answer qergle question he will resolve issue
[15:07:33] <rubiksdream> if you're familiar with multiple angle identities, there is an easy way to compute cos(x/2)cos(kx) by hand, notice it is just 1/2[cos(kx + x/2) + cos(kx - x/2)]
[15:07:37] <greenbagels> same
[15:08:06] <rubiksdream> now you are integrating int 1/2[cos(x(k + 1/2))] + int1/2[cos(x(k-1/2))]
[15:08:09] <cadmio> qergle: only the identity I think
[15:08:14] <rubiksdream> and the antiderivatives are plain
[15:08:19] <qergle> qergle note identity is not order 3

[15:55:00] <W> rubiksdream, just ran through that deduction on my own and arrived at the right answer indeed, thanks a lot for running me through it - to answer my own question, what I'm missing are memorizing trigonometric identities, and the general form of Fourier coefficients as integrals, the latter of which I'll now know (where to look up next time I forget)
[15:55:22] <cadmio> why has a r-cycle, r as order?

[15:59:00] <cadmio> the answer was simple: it's because if you have a permutation like (345) you cycle it (453), (534), (345) and you get the same one after 3
[15:59:25] <W> incidentally this solves about five other problems I've been blocked on before, since I now truly have a way to go from *any* periodic function of any period to at least an integral - might be stuck on how to work out the integral on some of them but that's a lot further than I've gotten before
[15:59:45] <qergle> you ask something different
[16:00:26] <qergle> question asked wasn't "why do 3-cycles have order 3" it was "why all order 3 elements of A_4 are 3-cycle"
[16:00:57] <qergle> i paste for memory
[16:00:58] <qergle> <cadmio> I'm not sure why elements with order 3 in A_4 can be only 3-cycles

[16:02:10] <riv> why has a r-cycle, r as order? <-- it's because (a b c d e f g h)^8 = identity
[16:04:24] <cadmio> yes so what I posted shows that at least the 3-cycles have order 3. Now if you have other permutation that could be written as disjoint cycles you'd have r=s*t then 3 should be the lcm of s and t
[16:05:31] <cadmio> but you can't have that lcm with 2-cycles and 4-cycles along with 3-cycles but only with 3-cycles

[17:59:52] <ProfSimm> Imagine a company gives you free loan, no interest rate if you return it in 14 days. You and your wife have a plan. You take a loan, in 14 days she takes a bit bigger loan, and gives you money to return yours. In 14 days you take a bigger loan than hers, and give her money to return hers. You can keep doing this forever, either by taking constant size loans and never having to return the original
[17:59:52] <ProfSimm> one, or taking ever increasing loans and having free money forever.
[18:00:02] <ProfSimm> Imagine that by default nothing exists, but as in vacuum particle/antiparticle pop out for a bit and re-merge, then so at the base of the universe this could've happened. Particle and antiparticle,  i.e. an oscillation between +1 and -1, back and forth in time at the very base of the universe. The existence kept borrowing itself from non-existence through constant back and forth movement. And
[18:00:02] <ProfSimm> from that, all reality emerged.

[22:35:54] <bildramer> practically? give it to N humans, see how many solve it and/or in how much time
[22:36:47] <bildramer> if you have thousands of problems, gather that data, also gather some other problem features, do a regression, then use the cheap features as an approximation so you don't have to do expensive lengthy tests every time

[22:38:12] <bildramer> then try to find a way to make "difficulty" quantifiable

[22:40:49] <qergle> and transitivity might not exist, making the ordering more challenging

Starting in say 1 i want to know what's the probability of hitting 0. It seems loogical to me that this should be 1-p, but apparently it's not and I can't figure out why. Any hints?

[23:02:32] <bildramer> the chance of hitting 0 immediately is 1-p, and you can also hit it later, so it should be larger than 1-p

[23:21:38] <cherim> This is a standard problem that got even to this chat more than once ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_ruin#Unfair_coin_flipping )
[23:22:01] <cherim> You can get an answer cheaply enough, at the cost of a bit of rigor
[23:22:27] <Guest95> Sorry, I jumped ahead when I shouldn't have.
[23:22:27] <Guest95> Going back, we saw IJ ⊆ I ∩ J. I want to now show the other direction. How do we use I+J = k[.]?
[23:23:13] <dauggy> thanks cherim
[23:23:24] <cherim> If the probability to ever reach 0 starting from 1 P, then the probability of ever reaching 0 starting from 2 is P^2, as you can decompose such histories as "walk till you first reach 1 from 2" and "walk till you then reach 0 from 1"
[23:23:29] <Guest95> oh if f in I and g in J, then f+g = 1, where 1 the identity
[23:23:44] <cherim> So the equation reads P=(1-p)*1 + p* P^2

[23:24:31] <dauggy> cherim: where does the square in the last term come from?
[23:24:48] <cherim> From 'as you can decompose such histories as "walk till you first reach 1 from 2" and "walk till you then reach 0 from 1" '
[23:25:08] <cherim> The first part is the same walk just with renamed 0->1, 1->2
[23:25:26] <Guest95> How do we use that there is some f,g such that f+g = 1, qergle ?
[23:26:02] <cherim> But the rigorous choice of the root requires more care, so if I'd have to explain this to a prepared audience, I'd solve it explicitly on [1...N] segments instead

[23:26:59] <cherim> Yes. Then you get an equation P_k= p * P_{k+1} + (1-p) P_{k-1}, with boundary conditions P_0=1 and P_N=0
[23:27:32] <qergle> Guest95: if f+g=1 then given any h ∈ I ∩ J, you have h=h(f+h)
[23:27:45] <cherim> This is a linear recurrence with explcit solution P_k = a + b \lambda^n, where \lambda is the root of a quadratic equation you get by substituting this
[23:27:48] <qergle> ie h = hf + hg, can you take it from here?
[23:27:58] <Guest95> Perhaps. I try.
[23:28:04] <cherim> Then you can take the limit N->infty in the answer
[23:28:30] <cherim> The formulas will be essentially as in the usual Gambler's ruin
[23:28:30] <qergle> i say same thing, for random walk, just didn't give as much detail
[23:29:17] <dauggy> and the last term is taken to the 2nd power, and not the the Nth one, because of the markov property, right?
[23:29:38] <dauggy> by the last term I meant P^2
[23:30:19] <qergle> it's nice to state as difference equation from the beginning as i hinted
