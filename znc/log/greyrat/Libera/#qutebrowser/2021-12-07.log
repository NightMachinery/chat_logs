[14:17:40] <gordon1> qutebrowser's rendering process started crashing all of a sudden, don't remember doing something related to browser explicitly (or updating qtwebengine)
[14:17:44] <gordon1> just tells that
[14:17:45] <gordon1> 10:46:31 ERROR: Renderer process crashed (status 31)
[14:17:55] <gordon1> even if i run qutebrowser -T
[14:18:06] <gordon1> little help with how i can debug that?
[14:25:18] <The-Compiler> gordon1: what OS/distribution? Anything interesting on stdout if launching in a terminal?
[14:25:31] <gordon1> gentoo
[14:25:35] <gordon1> nothing, just that
[14:25:55] <The-Compiler> musl libc?
[14:25:57] <gordon1> i tried to run it with -D wait-renderer-process and attached a debugger
[14:25:59] <gordon1> no, glibc
[14:26:07] <gordon1> got that
[14:26:09] <gordon1> Program received signal SIGSYS, Bad system call.
[14:26:11] <gordon1> 0x00007f38a7b142a9 in clone3 () from /lib64/libc.so.6
[14:26:21] <The-Compiler> ah
[14:26:23] <ionen> glibc-2.34?
[14:26:33] <gordon1> indeed 2.34
[14:26:42] <gordon1> is it something well-known?
[14:26:54] <The-Compiler> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glibc/+bug/1939993
[14:27:00] <gordon1> oh shit, yes i did update glibc yesterday
[14:27:08] <The-Compiler> https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtwebengine-chromium/+/374204
[14:27:13] <gordon1> thanks
[14:27:15] <ionen> fwiw gentoo has a USE=-clone3 to disable that on glibc
[14:27:17] <gordon1> any workaround?
[14:27:19] <gordon1> ah
[14:27:24] <gordon1> awesome
[14:27:27] <The-Compiler> I'd just apply that patch
[14:27:28] <gordon1> ionen: thank you!
[14:27:41] <The-Compiler> I'm somewhat confused you don't have that patch yet actually
[14:27:57] <ionen> actually me too, was under the impression this worked fine
[14:28:10] <The-Compiler> actually https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtwebengine-chromium/+/374205 for 5.15
[14:28:10] <ionen> but haven't upgraded glibc outside my test stuff
[14:28:28] <gordon1> thank you guys, saved my life
[14:28:39] <gordon1> i mean i yet to try it but i bet it will work
[14:28:42] <ionen> patching qtwebengine is trivial on gentoo anyhow
[14:29:00] <ionen> longer build than glibc[-clone3] though ;p
[14:29:08] <gordon1> true
[14:29:24] <gordon1> that's why i'm going with glibc
[14:30:15] <The-Compiler> maybe report a bug against the gentoo package though?
[14:30:34] <gordon1> you mean qtwebengine?
[14:30:42] <The-Compiler> yes
[14:30:59] <gordon1> sorry, i don't have a browser now to read the bug descriptions, is this a bug in glibc or in qtwebengine?
[14:31:31] <ionen> gordon1: just to be sure, are you using qtwebengine-5.15.2_p20211019?
[14:31:42] <ionen> I feel like this should have that patch already..
[14:31:49] <The-Compiler> it's a change in Chromium which was backported to QtWebEngine 2 months ago
[14:31:58] <gordon1> 5.15.2_p20210824-r1
[14:32:14] <gordon1> but i have compiled binpkg with 5.15.2_p20211019
[14:32:18] <gordon1> i can try it
[14:32:19] <The-Compiler> well, hard to tell with the Gentoo package because they invent their own version numbers instead of following upstream like any other distro
[14:32:25] <ionen> oh that version isn't even in gentoo anymore
[14:32:34] <ionen> you should upgrade
[14:32:46] <gordon1> just doing it right now
[14:32:52] <gordon1> this very moment
[14:33:54] <gordon1> here goes my session :(
[14:34:36] <gordon1> is there a way to keep list of open tabs somewhere outside the chrome state blackbox?
[14:38:30] <The-Compiler> gordon1: :session-save gives you human readable files (and so are the files in the sessions directory of qutebrowser)
[14:38:45] <gordon1> oh, should try that
[14:38:47] <gordon1> thanks
