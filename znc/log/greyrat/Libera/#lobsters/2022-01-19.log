[06:23:56] <kl1n3> gwozniak, i use asm more in embedded than x86, but specifically what bothers me is when you have annoying calling conventions, whiplash on cisc systems where you move between different levels of abstraction, and the constant fiddlyness where everyone wants to use a mix of byte, word, and ieee754 widths

[06:28:29] <gwozniak> I work on Arm and MIPS now, and I did AVR32 for a while.  I always need all the manuals present because remembering all the details is nearly impossible
[06:29:26] <gwozniak> Getting the addressing mode of an instruction correct and its allowable offsets can be very confusing
[06:29:59] <gwozniak> Then there are interrupts...
[06:30:10] <gwozniak> But I suppose that's more a system thing

[06:37:25] <gwozniak> I should say that I am mostly reading machine instructions, not writing them
[06:37:50] <gwozniak> If I want to write some assembly, I get the compiler to do it for me, then I tweak it :)

[14:57:02] <cherryblossom> vladimyr: Not that I know of. It would probably be challenging to create as Quora doesn't have a public API, and using an alternative frontend would be against the Quora ToS.
[14:57:29] <cherryblossom> This API for example got taken down by Quora: https://github.com/karan/Qnowledge
[14:57:29] <riv> speaking of
[14:57:40] <riv> are there any alternative Q&A sites? im fed up with stackoverflow
[14:58:02] <cherryblossom> https://codidact.org
[14:58:22] <cherryblossom> I believe it was created by ex-SO people
[14:58:52] <shantanuo> How do I register with https://lobste.rs/ ?
[14:59:02] <riv> ty I will check it out
[14:59:06] <varjag> v.v.v
[14:59:57] <cherryblossom> shantanuo: have a look at https://lobste.rs/about and https://lobste.rs/chat
[15:01:24] <cherryblossom> Basically either ask a lobste.rs user you know to send you an invite, or 'hang out and chat until people get to know you' here
[15:02:14] <shantanuo> ok. Thanks for the guidance.
[15:02:49] <shantanuo> But may I ask why it does not allow registration like other sites?
[15:02:50] <iDrougge> My impression of Quora is that of a search traffic farm.
[15:03:17] <cherryblossom> shantanuo: Probably to prevent spam
[15:03:26] <shantanuo> ok. Got it.
[15:03:29] <cherryblossom> The user tree (who invited who) is also public as 'This provides some degree of accountability and helps identify voting rings.'
[15:04:05] <edk> it also prevented the site from growing too fast which probably kept comment sections nicer
[15:04:12] <vladimyr> cherryblossom: oh ofc, I got spoiled by other alt fe so much that I didn't even think about that might violate their tos (facepalm)
[15:04:42] <edk> though i think most tech people probably know someone on lobsters at this point
[15:07:52] <cherryblossom> i probably don't count as a 'tech person' as i'm just a student (that loves progrmaming and tech), but i don't really know anyone yet on lobste.rs

[15:17:00] <vladimyr> <iDrougge> "My impression of Quora is that..." <- Agree but sometimes I end up finding real hidden gems like this one for example https://www.quora.com/What-goes-into-making-an-OS-to-be-Unix-compliant-certified
[15:18:08] <pja> That’s the link that floated past HN today, yes/
[15:18:10] <pja> ?
[15:19:19] <pja> cherryblossom: #haskell / #haskell-beginners are friendly ime, although I think some people have disappeared off into semi-private Discords.
[15:19:22] <vladimyr> I saw it on /u/wezm's Twitter https://nitter.koyu.space/wezm/status/1483710821821665285#m
[15:19:41] <pja> But if you have questions, they’re good places to try.
[15:20:25] <pja> vladimyr: Ah. I just read the tale of the Unix certification of OSX linked from HN, which was probably an answer to the same Quora question.
[15:21:49] <skrzyp> pja: i don't really get FOSS / "publicly respected" projects unironically using discord
[15:22:23] <riv> it's just the way things are now....
[15:22:33] <riv> we have collectively given up
[15:22:38] <skrzyp> maybe you
[15:22:39] <vladimyr> pja: I'd love to archive non-quora link, please share :)
[15:22:41] <skrzyp> xD
[15:22:41] <riv> I kind of blame GNU
[15:22:52] <riv> what came out of the GNU teleophony project
[15:22:54] <vladimyr> gnu?
[15:22:56] <pja> skrzyp: It is a bit weird. But discord is v. powerful & scriptable & for people that have had bad experiences with IRC (which is /not/ small) a community irc-like system that has moderation tools built in can seem like an excellent place to take refuge.
[15:23:07] <riv> stuff like jitsi and ring?
[15:23:12] <skrzyp> pja: >"scriptable"
[15:23:17] <riv> not really valid alternatives
[15:23:29] <riv> people need tools to take advantages of new features/technology
[15:23:31] <pja> OSS tools tend to be open by default, which is bad if your community has a problem with trolls.
[15:23:34] <skrzyp> like "you get banned if you use anything other than our bloated and semi-working electron app"?
[15:23:41] <riv> and if free software doesn't deliver, people will just use stuff like discord
[15:23:46] <pja> or simply with arguments that some people just won’t drop.
[15:24:02] <riv> there's no leadership in GNU that is prioritizing things correctly and encouraging things that matter to be made
[15:24:23] <pja> skrzyp:?
[15:24:38] <skrzyp> pja: you can't use 3rdparty discord clients officially
[15:24:42] <skrzyp> it's against the TOS
[15:24:44] <skrzyp> really
[15:24:46] <pja> I mean, sure: it’s not fully scriptable. But you can do /a lot/ with bots & channel settings.
[15:24:57] <pja> & that’s a whole lot better than IRC immediately.
[15:25:09] <vladimyr> In my experience Discord groups, although having better moderation tools, often accumulate more spam and overall turn in low quality ball of mud
[15:25:29] <skrzyp> pja: oh, so that's what you meant by "scriptable"
[15:25:38] <skrzyp> i was thinking about client-side scripting
[15:26:17] <pja> Discourse is good for forum style comms & is OSS. But there’s nothing OSS out there that’s IRC, but with moderation tools & community controls that I know of.
[15:26:33] <vladimyr> No, you can't do things that actually matter but you can easily create meme bot in python :^)
[15:26:46] <pja> Slack swooped in & took the corporate comms side & Discord picked up all the gamers & has been expanding out from there.
[15:27:00] <vladimyr> Zulip maybe?
[15:27:13] <pja> Yeah, I’ve seen some teams using Zulip.

[23:20:34] <JordiGH> "Hey, router, give me number 500." "Oh, sure thing client, everything below 100 is right on this port of mine, but 500 is higher and is on this other physical port, let me send you that way and they'll tell you over there where to go."
[23:20:34] <pe> I'm so sad that being devoted to my saucy Lord doesn't come with food delivery benefits.
[23:20:49] <JordiGH> The numbers are so you can use ranges and routers can know what range goes where.
[23:21:13] <JordiGH> jkaye: *.subnet.mask
[23:21:35] <JordiGH> But yeah, 4 bytes must be nice.
[23:21:49] <companion_cube> why do computers have int registers but not full string registers? :p
[23:22:30] *** Joins: ur5us (~ur5us@203.86.198.200)
[23:23:03] *** Joins: frm_ (~frm@user/frm)
[23:24:04] <JordiGH> Okay, so to answer my original question: DNS is complicated because 4 bytes is very nice to write hardware for.
[23:26:51] <companion_cube> I think that's basically it
[23:26:59] <companion_cube> also, an IP points to a machine directly
[23:27:14] <companion_cube> whereas a DNS record can have many layers of indirection (see: CNAME)
[23:27:30] <companion_cube> alias foo.bar.fr to bar.fr
[23:27:42] <companion_cube> (and recursively if you like indirection)
[23:27:44] <af> companion_cube: IPs don't point to machines anymore, nothing does
[23:28:01] <companion_cube> s/machine/virtual machine/ if you want
[23:28:05] <pe> Fuck they don't.
[23:28:07] <companion_cube> something with a kernel
[23:28:21] <af> no, I mean anycast
[23:28:33] <companion_cube> I'm not familiar with that :/
[23:28:50] <pe> Though the machine is my router, admittedly.
[23:28:51] <companion_cube> I know multicast can emit to a range, but that's the extent of my knowledge 😅
[23:29:45] <jkaye> Implying all traffic is anycast traffic?
[23:29:46] <af> basically bgp is used to virtualize ips
[23:30:10] <af> jkaye: it can be, and every day now more of it is anycast traffic thanks to cloudflare and others
[23:30:14] <JordiGH> Remember when you could ping the whole internet
[23:30:21] <pe> zmap?
[23:30:21] <JordiGH> What was it you had to do?
[23:31:02] <pe> I remember it took them under an hour to scan every-fucking-thing within IPv6 at the time of release.
[23:31:08] <pe> IPv4
[23:31:08] <jkaye> Do you know that there are a LOT of networks that are not the internet?
[23:31:12] <pe> Let's not be ridiculous.
[23:31:22] <jkaye> IPs don't point to machines anymore is a /crazy/ take
[23:31:23] <iDrougge> Do you mean Appletalk networks?
[23:32:08] <af> I wish it was a crazy take
[23:32:17] <companion_cube> I suppose it's as naive as "DNS is name->IP"
[23:32:34] <companion_cube> true in general, but wrong in many cases still
[23:33:11] <iDrougge> JordiGH: In the beginning, there was no DNS.
[23:33:17] <af> I'd argue "IPs point to machines" is more crazy/naive than "IPs don't point to machines"
[23:33:18] <pe> Scary.
[23:33:38] <iDrougge> Everyone kept their own /etc/hosts and regularly updated it by fetching it via FTP from an authoritative server.
[23:33:39] <companion_cube> af: even if "machine" includes VM?
[23:33:57] <af> companion_cube: yes
[23:33:59] <af> or containers
[23:34:00] <JordiGH> iDrougge: I relish to go back to this golden age.
[23:34:02] <companion_cube> that seems strange.
[23:34:08] <companion_cube> what's the common case then?
[23:35:01] <af> common is hard to define
[23:35:12] <af> on the public internet? by sheer bandwidth?
[23:35:33] <af> or just by percentage of all IP packets from all "machines" worldwide?
[23:35:41] <JordiGH> in the deep web
[23:36:15] <JordiGH> Okay, so what's the book to read about DNS?
[23:36:37] <JordiGH> And don't tell me it's just a compilation of the RFCs in printed format.
[23:36:44] <mockturtle> Get out early with Perl statement modifiers [practices perl] (mjgardner) https://lobste.rs/s/q8vrzw
[23:38:23] <companion_cube> af: yeah ok, it's not uniform, I suppose
[23:38:30] <af> indeed
[23:38:33] <companion_cube> let's say, the public IPs you can ping?
[23:38:44] *** Quits: rickybob (~rickybob@gateway/vpn/pia/rickybob) (Quit: rickybob)
[23:39:23] <jkaye> It's really not, unless you append "on the public internet"
[23:40:01] <jkaye> "IPs don't point to machines anymore" is just wrong. "IPs on the public internet don't point to machines" is still wrong, but a /lot/ closer (and perhaps correct enough to be worth saying)
[23:41:13] <JordiGH> Are we talking about NAT or what?
[23:42:15] <af> You can argue semantics all day long, the point is that IPs are getting more and more virtualized by the day
[23:42:49] <JordiGH> Where's my Learn DNS in 21 Days book?
[23:42:51] <af> And if we really wanna play the pedant's game, then entire swathes of IPv4 addresses point to nothing
[23:45:10] <jkaye> I agree with both of those statements actually
[23:45:35] <jkaye> Someone who doesn't know about networking could read the original statement and have no idea what you meant though
[23:45:51] <jkaye> I'm not trying to be pedantic. Internal networks are still important, even when the cloud exists

[23:46:13] <imode> "IPs don't point to machines anymore" sure they do. just not your standard desktop computer, or directly to a server. :P
[23:46:16] <af> Fair. I didn't mean it as an educational statement - more a jab at centralization of traffic
[23:46:22] <JordiGH> Wrong DNS :-( https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-13-0038-7
[23:46:24] <mockturtle> [ DNS of Wall-Bounded Turbulent Flows | SpringerLink ] - link.springer.com
[23:46:26] <pe> A ton of IPs still point to residential routers.
[23:46:41] <imode> mine definitely does.
[23:46:45] <imode> otherwise this would be awkward.
[23:46:57] <pe> I'm not even paying for it...
[23:47:29] <af> I do hope some ipv6 based overlay networks really take off
[23:47:41] <af> like, yggdrasil, but better
[23:47:45] <companion_cube> imode: well there's an IP pointing to my VPS :p
[23:47:51] <companion_cube> so it happens sometimes at least!
[23:47:59] <imode> companion_cube: there are dozens of us, dozens!
[23:48:29] <pe> I have a direct DMZ redirect (ugh).
[23:49:43] <pe> And I only learned about the fact that I have a static public IP through trying out IPv6, which didn't work.
[23:50:01] <pe> In some awkward fashion.
[23:50:19] <pe> I'm not sure if it's normal for IPv6 to not work.
