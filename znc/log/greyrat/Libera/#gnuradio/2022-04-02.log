[15:11:25] <funkylab[m]> what kind of transmissions are we talking about? Synchronization is trypically very system-specific. For example, for heavily multipath channel, you'd often use an OFDM scheme, and one classic and good preamble-based frequency and time recovery methods is Schmidl&Cox; you can do Schmidl&Cox without the rest of your system being based on OFDM, but you'd be implementing half an OFDM receiver just for the preamble
[15:16:43] <funkylab[m]> if you have a flat channel, by pure courtesy of physics or an equalizer, then direct recovery through properties of the signal do work, and using a preamble is very helpful for timing recovery and because it can be used to guarantee specific statistic properties (e.g. sufficient amount of symbol transitions); Oerder & Meyr is a classic method, where you get an estimate of the symbol rate and -timing at once :)
