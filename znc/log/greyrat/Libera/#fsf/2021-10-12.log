[01:01:02] <M6piz7wk[m]> So i have a project that is fully spected and has a strict standard to allow modularization.. 
[01:01:02] <M6piz7wk[m]> In practice the software has specified a default bare minimum configuration to which it compiles that e.g. provide the autopilot
[01:01:02] <M6piz7wk[m]> This depends on the hardware so for some usecases this needs different backend, frontend or bridge for those to communicate with each other, but these both follow the spec and standard
[01:01:02] <M6piz7wk[m]> Is is against the GPLv3 compilance if i ban forks and require contributors to submit their contributions to the main repository? Since they can basically rewrote the whole project which would be just a change in the config file that influences the compilation
[01:01:26] *** Joins: Bronzu (~Bronzu@user/bronzu)
[01:01:30] <M6piz7wk[m]> The motivation for this is to avoid forks that break the spec and standard which would create a segmentation that would harm the security of the project
[01:03:01] <M6piz7wk[m]> while forks are possible if the people fork the spec and standard.. i just want to specify that if people want to use this spec and standard that they have to use my repo and submit the changes there to be compliant
[01:04:14] <M6piz7wk[m]> Since this is a mission critical environment which failure could cause a disaster like aircraft crashing into a buildings etc..
[01:05:33] <M6piz7wk[m]> oh and the repo mandates Open-Source for the changes to be mergable
[01:05:52] <M6piz7wk[m]> (i didn't yet figured out my non-free policy so i don't want to discuss it now)
[01:07:48] <Nintendo> It's true that people will break specs and not think twice about it, but I don't understand how that would ‚Äúharm the security‚Äù of your own project.
[01:08:47] <Nintendo> Are you worried about being undercut?
[01:09:23] <M6piz7wk[m]> rather worried about people flooding the market with "standard and spec compliant things" that are not compliant while making it seem very convincing that it is
[01:10:07] <M6piz7wk[m]> also about wild forks that make the pilots think that the software is safe when it's not
[01:10:25] <Nintendo> Many operations resolve that by providing official certification.
[01:10:57] <M6piz7wk[m]> since my standard requires an extensive testing and developing a simulation scenarios for training and to as soon as possible process any reported incidents 
[01:11:15] <M6piz7wk[m]> ... so that i can issue air wortiness directive as soon as possible if there is something that requires it
[01:11:33] *** Joins: odoood__ (~odoood@2601:c8:c003:a550::3)
[01:11:39] <M6piz7wk[m]> Nintendo: ye that i already want to do.. but rather worried about people forking it and giving me bad PR

[01:12:17] <M6piz7wk[m]> since this way they can pass certification and then somewhat easily change the design to make it seem like certified aircraft was involved in an accident
[01:12:25] <Nintendo> I'm not sure about bad PR, but if a fork violates your spec, you could provide a grace period for them to reform before revoking their certification.
[01:12:47] <M6piz7wk[m]> well without doing something like blockchain parts so that the aircraft has to verify itself on each preflight check.. that the pilot can still overwrite bcs its' open source
[01:13:18] <M6piz7wk[m]> Nintendo: i can't offer grace period.. if they violate spec or standard then that is air worthiness directive as soon as possible
[01:13:28] <Nintendo> Then don't.
[01:13:40] <Nintendo> Revoke immediately.
[01:13:50] <M6piz7wk[m]> (air worthiness directive = if the aircraft tries to take off on an airfield governed by e.g. FAA then it will be prevented from takeoff)
[01:13:54] <Nintendo> But that's not how certification works in general.
[01:14:01] *** Quits: ozoned (odoood@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/odoood) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[01:14:13] <M6piz7wk[m]> Nintendo: the issue is that i can't easily know that they are violating it without enforcing it like this
[01:14:47] <M6piz7wk[m]> where i was thinking that all the parts would be scannable so that the aircraft has to go on random free inspections to ensure that it's compilant 
[01:15:23] <M6piz7wk[m]> and if there are wild forks then that would make this enforcement impossible and made the design significantly more dangerous
[01:16:02] <Nintendo> So you want to provide software as a service?
[01:17:15] *** Joins: GNUmoon (~GNUmoon@gateway/tor-sasl/gnumoon)
[01:17:18] <M6piz7wk[m]> this is also design-as-code.. the parts just can be manufactured by third parties that has to go through certification
[01:17:18] <M6piz7wk[m]> the issue is to ensure that it's not running a software that would cause the part to malfunction which is next to impossible to verify in a reasonable amount of time
[01:17:43] <Nintendo> In any case, I am no authority on free software, but I can say with confidence that ‚Äúbanning forks‚Äù stands against the basic principles.
[01:18:20] <M6piz7wk[m]> to clarify my aircraft design is modular so that e.g. you can remove the tail and put on a different one to get automatically certified to use this new configuration.. the tail might have a components that interact with the autopilot and if that runs some wild fork then that would make it risky
[01:18:34] <Nintendo> It sounds interesting.
[01:19:00] <M6piz7wk[m]> Nintendo: i don't want to go against the spirit of granting people the ability to submit changes.. i just want it to enforce the way they do that in the main repository 
[01:19:36] <M6piz7wk[m]> so that i can enforce standard and spec or explicitly set that "this software is not compliant, pilot has to sign a legal document stripping me from any liability if the aircraft crashes"
[01:20:01] <Nintendo> Many projects do that by earning the trust of the community.
[01:20:11] <Nintendo> Then, nobody even wants to use the forks.
[01:20:17] <M6piz7wk[m]> bcs i don't mind wild forks that fail certification i even encourage that as long as it's properly logged that the pilot chosed to use uncertified part and with the knowledge of local authority
[01:20:36] <M6piz7wk[m]> e.g. FAA might allow the pilot to use part A that is not secure enough for me which i assume will be a regular occurance 
[01:21:01] <M6piz7wk[m]> since i am below FAA they can always overwrite my standard and my air worthiness directives 
[01:22:04] <M6piz7wk[m]> Nintendo: trust is not enough for this usecase.. one crash that can be linked to my project and i would lose funding and have to rework the whole thing.. i want each incident to be actionable as soon as possible and being liberal with AFD

[01:27:36] <M6piz7wk[m]> also my software and hardware designs are made so that if there is an incident the aircraft (if pilot chooses to be part of that program) automatically reports telemetry for public review..
[01:27:36] <M6piz7wk[m]> So lets say there is a something that requires the pilot to train for the situation like `Turkish Airlines flight 981` (involving an aircraft which door flew off mid-air causing a major disaster with iirc 200 ppl dead) -> I want to immediately issue AFD and mandate a new simulator training for the pilots so that if they ever get in such situation they know what to do.
[01:28:14] <Armand> Interesting pipedream.
[01:29:02] <M6piz7wk[m]> and immediately like:
[01:29:02] <M6piz7wk[m]> the accident happens -> few seconds later the aircraft submit a telemetry for review -> the  "hot" review is finished under +- 10 min issuing AWD before the aircraft that is involved in the accident even got on the ground

[01:35:08] <LiaoTao> From re-reading the license it seems to me that you want to impose so-called "further restrictions" on your users.
[01:35:35] <LiaoTao> IANAL but it seems you only have the right to deny trademarks and make others label their forks as such while keeping a reference to your original version
[01:36:04] <LiaoTao> Hopefully someone will hop along soon enough and give you a thorough answer
[01:38:41] <M6piz7wk[m]> No i want the project to be integrated in my repository 
[01:38:49] <M6piz7wk[m]> ... repository and build system
[01:39:22] <M6piz7wk[m]> like imagine huge repository composed of 2000+ git submodules and the build system building the project depending on what it was instructed to do
[01:40:31] <M6piz7wk[m]> e.g. i might have autopilot implementation like:
[01:40:31] <M6piz7wk[m]> Manufacturer A using software from developer Z using programming language H that is designed for part G
[01:40:31] <M6piz7wk[m]> Then variation of the variables
[01:40:39] <LiaoTao> I know what you want to do and I'm not exactly condemning it, but you are telling the users they can only get the source code if any modifications are kept "with you".

[01:43:28] <M6piz7wk[m]> i need each accident logged and acted upon without the use of uncertified parts creating an unwanted complexity
[01:44:11] <Armand> It's definitely a non-starter.
[01:44:19] <M6piz7wk[m]> it's liek science you want to reduce the variables as much as possible and uncertified parts are not required to give me the FreeCAD models, simulator files, etc..

[01:48:33] <M6piz7wk[m]> for my design something like this could cause the aircraft to crash after it takes off
[01:48:43] <M6piz7wk[m]> and FAA is going to be too slow at regulating this atm

[03:05:28] <dragestil> yrk: thanks. i sent the wrong message to alis
[03:05:40] <dragestil> which is why it didn't show anything lol
[03:05:48] <M6piz7wk[m]> like gitpod was non-free because they didn't know how to optimize the economy to keep themselves above the water for example
[03:08:25] <yrk> M6piz7wk[m]: "didn't know how to optimize the economy" == "wanted to make money off of it more than they wanted to give people freedom"
[03:08:58] <M6piz7wk[m]> like for-profits are usually more about money then they are about freedom
[03:09:35] <yrk> M6piz7wk[m]: absolutely. in fact, in some countries they are legally required to maximize shareholder interest.
[03:10:03] <yrk> M6piz7wk[m]: ...and unfortunately plenty of non-profits have the same misordered goals
[03:10:24] <M6piz7wk[m]> ye i want to enforce user freedom through constitution
[03:10:58] <M6piz7wk[m]> working on the wording atm..

[03:12:05] <Armand> Before that, you'd need to look at the likelihood of actually getting some form of approval from the FAA.. assuming it's for any form of aviation purpose.
[03:12:33] <M6piz7wk[m]> So far: Software freedom has to be enforced unless there are:
[03:12:33] <M6piz7wk[m]> a) Economical reasons preventing us to sustain the project
[03:12:33] <M6piz7wk[m]> b) Security issues that weren't yet handled to enable public review

[03:13:14] <yrk> M6piz7wk[m]: how are you going to enforce it?
[03:13:29] <Armand> With forks? You can't.

[03:14:18] <yrk> M6piz7wk[m]: for instance, copyright is enforced, ultimately, the same way as any other western law: the threat of armed individuals busting down your door and carrying you off to jail
[03:14:19] <M6piz7wk[m]> yrk: i like the idea of enabling the paying members to elect their representatives that vote on the changes to the constitution with an option to impeach them if they violate set goals
[03:14:44] <yrk> M6piz7wk[m]: so... the people pay for the option of being impeached?
[03:14:49] <Armand> lol
[03:15:13] <yrk> M6piz7wk[m]: once again, who's _force_ will you use to _enforce_ these rules?
[03:15:23] <M6piz7wk[m]> nah elected officials are paid by the project.. didn't yet decided how much politically involved i want that to be
[03:16:34] <M6piz7wk[m]> yrk: Current ideas are to give FSF network seats in the counsil so that they can influence the decisions, but i am concerned that FSF would drove the project to the ground economically 
[03:16:34] <M6piz7wk[m]> i also like the idea of EU enforcing it
[03:16:52] <M6piz7wk[m]> since EU seems to be pretty aligned with software freedom atm
[03:17:48] <Armand> But then you still need approval from a governing body, for aviation purposes.
[03:18:07] <yrk> well... that's me out. M6piz7wk[m]: I still didn't understand what this is all about, but I wish you the very best in any freedom-respecting endeavors you may pursue
[03:18:23] <Armand> Best idea.
[03:19:04] <M6piz7wk[m]> Armand: that's why it's designed to be below FAA just having it's own certification to enforce it's recommendation that can be overwritten by governing bodies
[03:19:30] <Armand> To be under the FAA, it requires approval.
[03:19:44] <M6piz7wk[m]> not the way i have it designed
[03:19:49] <Armand> If they won't certify it for purpose, then it's rhetorical.
[03:20:00] <Armand> .. which it's quite likely that they won't.

[03:20:19] <M6piz7wk[m]> it's not meant to be like official FAA subsidiary.. rather independent certifier that FAA might follow in their infinite wisdom
[03:20:32] <Armand> Which they won't
[03:20:33] <M6piz7wk[m]> if not then i am not liable for their mitakes
[03:20:35] <M6piz7wk[m]> *mistakes
[03:20:40] <Armand> You would be
[03:20:55] <Armand> You'd be liable for information submitted for approval.
[03:21:24] <M6piz7wk[m]> that's irelevant i know i have to comply with FAA regulations and procedures to make the design approved in their airspace 
[03:21:54] <Armand> Then the software license becomes a secondary concern.
[03:22:08] <Armand> If it doesn't meet approval, the license is irrelevant.
[03:22:14] <M6piz7wk[m]> but i want independent and transparent certification that is open for cooperation if they want it.. if not and accident happens after i've filed a AWD about that exact issue that FAA didn't act up on then it's not my liability
[03:22:38] <Armand> 1. They won't want it.
[03:22:50] <M6piz7wk[m]> they like the idea atm
[03:22:52] <Armand> 2. You'd still be liable for any information, product or servies.
[03:22:55] <Armand> *services
[03:23:46] <Armand> Anything that they *don't* act upon is irrelevant, as liability is asserted as necessary.
[03:24:42] <Armand> Regardless, the approval process is the first and last hurdle of relevance.

[03:25:00] <M6piz7wk[m]> so excluding the things that FAA requires to be compliant and assuming it being compliant with those -> The project legally only provides certification in a scientific way like:
[03:25:00] <M6piz7wk[m]> This wing was tested in such and such environment with such and such airspeed in which it produced this much of lift and broke under X amount of Newtons applied as (process description, images, videos, etc..) manufactured method A B C by someone
[03:25:29] <M6piz7wk[m]> if something like miracle on the hudson happens and the design fails above it's tested criteria then it's different legal matter 
[03:25:41] <Armand> They already have testing certification.
[03:26:20] <M6piz7wk[m]> which is irelevant as the project already complies with it.. the issue is that FAA doesn't require enough to make this kind of design secure thus my own certification

[03:26:52] <Armand> Aviation is regulated.
[03:27:05] <Armand> Enforcement is a legal issue.
[03:28:00] <M6piz7wk[m]> yes aviation is very regulated, but things like engine explosion due to the microfractures still happen which then takes weeks to act up on

[08:15:10] <M6piz7wk[m]> in my design e.g. the aircraft gets shot with the bullet it shows exactly where the bullet hit and what kind of damage it could have caused to then run simulations 
[08:15:25] <Armand> But we already do that.
[08:15:35] <Armand> IF such a thing were to occur.
[08:15:51] <M6piz7wk[m]> e.g. bullet hits a fuel line and you then see that the engine bay temperature increased significantly after and got fire alarm then you can make an informed deduction to what happened
[08:15:59] <Armand> But we already do that.
[08:16:11] <M6piz7wk[m]> no we do bare minimum atm and to find something alike it needs an extensive investigation
[08:16:17] <Armand> Bullshit.
[08:16:28] <Armand> That's actually an outright lie.
[08:16:56] <M6piz7wk[m]> might seem like it because you lack info as the handling is confidential
[08:17:03] <Armand> Hahahahhaaa
