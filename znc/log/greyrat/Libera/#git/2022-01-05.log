[03:33:17] <octav1a> Hello, I have a merge question. A while ago, we had a primary branch 'master' of which I branched to a feature branch 'F' and started working, made commits, etc. Priorities changes and it wasn't worked on for a while. In the mean time, 'master' was renamed to 'main', not really sure if this has an impact. I have pulled / updated both main and F to their latest version from server. I now am trying to merge some stuff from main back to the very outdated 'F' ,
[03:33:17] <octav1a> however, it just says "Already up to date" --- clearly not the case. How can I initiate the merge?

[14:03:38] <GreenAlpaca> Hi, I have a question regarding repository structure design: I have a set of SQL procedures. Multiple projects/clients have their own versions of the procedures, but they also use a CORE set of procedures that is the same for all clients. How would you design a repository structure for such scenario?
[14:04:22] *** Lord_of_Life_ is now known as Lord_of_Life
[14:04:23] <GreenAlpaca> I am thinking of having each client's procedures in their own repository and linking the CORE repository as a submodule in each of them, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to do it
[14:06:47] <parv> GreenAlpaca, use a separate branch/project, 'rebase'd over "core" branch? I haven't used submodules much, so cannot say anything about that

[15:30:54] <aruns> Hi, I am running Git 2.17.1. I have a WordPress plugin on a shared work project (for a WordPress site), where the plugin's vendor folder has a nested Git repo.
[15:31:08] <aruns> How do I include the vendor folder without Git complaining about the nested repo?
[15:31:45] <aruns> Gitignoring the vendor folder impedes our workflow, as we would then have to install it from the live server whenever it's missing

[15:32:12] <canton7> aruns, are you familiar with submodules? https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules
[15:32:32] <j416> deleting the repo (.git dir) could also be an option

[15:33:05] <aruns> As it will cause the plugin to not work on local environments
[15:33:46] <aruns> Maybe my current approach, i.e. gitignoring the vendor folder, is best for now
[15:34:12] <aruns> Really an issue on the plugin developer's end
[15:35:44] <aruns> canton7: I take it there is no way to have Git treat a nested repo as regular files / folders?
[15:36:21] <aruns> Trouble with the WordPress plugin using a nested repo is that we still have to sync any plugin upgrades from the live server etc

I usually download the files and create a git repo and then I delete the folder on my production server and download the repo from there.

[21:42:36] <OnlineCop> It was mostly a TL;DR for the difference between `git add -u` and `git add -A`. No worries.

[22:58:31] <betterOn1> hi
[22:59:09] <betterOn1> how can i see the remote version of a file while repo is in merge conflict mode?
[22:59:46] <betterOn1> it shows conflicts on the file but i want to see pure version from server
[22:59:56] <ikke> git show :3:path/to/file
[23:00:15] <j416> betterOn1: your repos is local, so there's no network involved here
[23:00:21] <j416> repo*
[23:01:08] <betterOn1> j416: you're right.. i asked wrong question

[23:01:23] <betterOn1> i pulled the latest version on master and try to merge a feature branch
[23:01:26] <jrm> It's nice that git can be extended with new commands with custom scripts like git-foo to run a new command 'git foo'.  If someone wanted to extend an existing command with a new argument, is there similar functionality?  I would like to extend 'git am' with a new '-U <URL>' argument.  I created a 'git amu -U <url>...' and it works great, but 'git am -U <url>...' would be even nicer if that's possible.
[23:01:43] <betterOn1> i want to see the version on master branch
[23:01:48] <j416> jrm: I don't think so.
