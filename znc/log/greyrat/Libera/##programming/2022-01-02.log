[02:08:39] <nomagno> No, it's not just monotheistic religion

[02:09:26] <apotheon> ProfSimm: "Because" is the answer of religion.

[02:11:30] <ProfSimm> apotheon: it's quite possible that the concept of truth itself has no meaning in the larger universe. Truth is simply a belief you're coupled to by means of your constitution depending on it (through happenstance), or not understanding relativity you believe something as fundamental which is not.

[02:37:07] <vdamewood> I think the only problems I have with JavaScript are its scoping rules and the fact tht it uses floating-points for all numbers. (and in later versions, that undecorated numeric literals are floating-point numbers.)
[02:37:37] <pyzozord> python and javascript are different on the syntax level, but I'm not looking at the syntax
[02:37:48] <EdFletcher> Wholeheartedly second apotheon here, I’ve written both for years in both personal and pro contexts and Python is no where close to the ergonomic and expressiveness of the good language hiding within JS 
[02:37:53] <apotheon> I enjoyed writing plumbing in JavaScript.  Writing user-facing code was pure misery.

[02:39:21] <phogg> I concur on all of this JS talk. It's surprisingly nice, really. All languages have some warts, JS fewer than average.
[02:39:26] <apotheon> One of the biggest problems with contemporary JS is the fact that it has this (relatively) massive edifice of cobbled-together class-based object system cruft piled on top of the clean, elegant core of a prototype-based object system that has been there "forever".
[02:39:27] <pyzozord> but honestly I don't think web would be better if we had python instead of javascript
[02:39:31] <pyzozord> in the browsers
[02:39:41] <pyzozord> the same people would be writing web
[02:39:51] <apotheon> If it had just gotten its half-a-prototype-object-system completed, it would surely be a *much* better language.

[02:42:26] <EdFletcher> It does have a ton of warts, far more than most, but as you implied apotheon, there all there because JS _never_ breaks backward compat: https://exploringjs.com/impatient-js/ch_history.html#backward-compatibility

[04:58:58] <InPhase> pulse: I had never heard of this game, but it sounds like they had huge vocal customer interest up front for Linux versions, but then they delivered a game that didn't work on Linux, so nobody bought it for Linux once people saw that it didn't work on Linux, so they marked it down as having no sales...  Because people don't want to buy things that don't work.
[04:59:56] <pulse> InPhase, yeah, i suspect they were just a loud majority
[05:00:07] <pulse> the lesson here is to target the right system i suppose
[05:00:12] <pulse> not that linux releases are necessarily bad
[05:00:28] <InPhase> pulse: Here's a simple test question.  How many of their in-house developers actually did development and smoke-testing ON Linux?
[05:00:46] <lettuce[m]> What comes to mind without thinking on how to store it, is a dictionary where the key is the word and the value is the count. First store that comes to mind that is fast is Redis, but any NoSQL could work.
[05:00:56] <pulse> good question InPhase 
[05:01:40] <InPhase> pulse: I have a program at work that runs on Linux, Mac, and Windows.  It only runs on Mac because one of the programmers working on it decided to start developing it on a Mac, so he fixed up the Mac-specific problems so he could do that.  It was mostly cross-platform, but there are always small issues.
[05:02:19] <PlanckWalk> If there are only a few messages per millisecond then pretty much any way of aggregating the counts will be fast enough.
[05:03:01] <PlanckWalk> (Unless you do something bizarre like completely rewrite a file on a non-SDD disk every message)
[05:03:05] <PlanckWalk> SSD*
[05:03:13] <InPhase> pulse: For OpenSCAD most of the developers run Linux, so it pretty much always runs fine on Windows.  We sometimes have weird Windows bugs that go unsolved for a while, usually involving estoteric graphics driver issues that only arise on Windows (sounds like the tweet, huh?).  And for about two years Mac support was a real toss-up because the primary Mac developer went on a break for a while.
[05:03:24] <InPhase> I mean. pretty much always runs fine on Linux.
[05:04:26] <PlanckWalk> If something is developed with a Windows-centric approach and other platforms are an afterthought then it's only going to work on Windows.
[05:04:44] <InPhase> If you want reliable cross-platform support, and you have a team, you should try to structure your team around that and make sure there is regular cross-platform testing going on along the way.
[05:04:47] <PlanckWalk> (With any degree of reliability)
[05:05:18] <pulse> i think cross platform is a pain in the butt in most circumstances
[05:05:31] <PlanckWalk> and yeah, when things are breaking on an afterthougth platform, you're going to get a lot of bug reports for that platform
[05:05:39] <InPhase> It's really not so hard if you set it as an initial goal and stick to cross-platform libraries.
[05:06:00] <pulse> yeah but you have to be careful. lots of landmines
[05:06:04] <InPhase> BUT, it does require regular testing to catch the weird edge cases.
[05:06:45] <PlanckWalk> These days you often want to release on multiple platforms anyway
[05:06:47] <InPhase> That sort of testing would not lead to what they described there.  They probably baked in Linux-specific bugs deep that they couldn't find.

I have tried the default devx module and downloading a newer gcc from the repository.  Different versions of wine do

[13:19:50] <deniska> My dad and I manage our own server on a co-location in a datacenter, much cheaper long run than using VPSes
[13:20:17] <pyzozord> that's pretty cool, why do you need a server though?
[13:21:17] <pyzozord> i have one for blog, but i stopped blogging
[13:21:21] <pyzozord> I should get back to that
[13:21:39] <deniska> pyzozord: he has some clients he manages databases for and I… run irssi on it I guess :D
[13:21:40] <pyzozord> vps though, not colocation, colocation is cool
[13:22:16] <pyzozord> oh cool, i wish i had clients so that I needed a colocation server
[13:22:20] <deniska> also game servers, etc, also pondered running nextcloud on it
[13:22:54] <pyzozord> I'd run my own email server, except I'd be afraid my spam filter wouldn't be as good as googles
[13:23:53] <deniska> it did cost about $1200 for a server, and we pay about $25/mo to a datacenter to host it
[13:24:59] <deniska> 256gb of ram, xeon e5-2680 × 2

[13:25:26] <tomathy> why did the computing industry accelerate so quickly?
[13:25:29] <mrig> What would be the main thing that stops people running servers from home?
[13:25:33] <mrig> Hello :)
[13:25:56] <deniska> mrig: actual rack mount servers are typically noisy and fairly big
[13:25:58] <GeDaMo> Bandwidth limits maybe?
[13:26:00] <mrig> Upload bandwith or is there some block put on by ISP's
[13:26:09] <deniska> mrig: also many home ISPs are of subpar quality
[13:26:16] <mrig> deniska yes and hot to I should think-
[13:26:17] <tomathy> mrig: probably security
[13:26:21] <deniska> some disallow serving on port 80/443 etc
[13:26:37] <EdFletcher> Also attack surface, most people don’t want bots hammering their home connection all day every day 
[13:27:39] <deniska> One of the previous incarnations of the server we run we actually did ran at home, but it was a NUC, which is small and doesn't eat a lot of power :)
[13:27:41] <pyzozord> I think having your server in a datacenter comes with some benefits, like cooling, five nines guarantee of power supply etc
[13:27:53] <mrig> Do server locations grab a swath of IP's from an ISP?
[13:27:58] <tomathy> also you can destroy it
[13:28:21] <tomathy> here's a question, why do people cool servers, when you could use them as heating
[13:28:29] <mrig> deniska right yes, I was pondering a rasbery pi just for the fun and experiance.
[13:28:30] <deniska> pyzozord: nah, we're on a cheapo tier-2 location, we don't have that many nines of guarantee :)
[13:29:07] <deniska> "oops, our air conditioning broke" was a thing last year there

[15:59:31] <deniska> tomathy: it's a good idea to put your web server behind a reverse-proxy server like nginx
[16:00:03] * tomathy looks up reverse proxy server
[16:00:16] <deniska> apache is fine as a reverse proxy too, but nginx config format is arguably nicer
[16:00:35] <tomathy> is that the same as a firewall?
[16:00:43] <pyzozord> nginx is more popular I think
[16:00:51] <deniska> tomathy: sorta but not really
[16:01:11] <pyzozord> there is also lighttpd but I never used it and don't know anyone who does
[16:01:18] <deniska> I used lighttpd for a while
[16:01:55] <pyzozord> is it lighter than nginx?
[16:02:03] <deniska> not sure :)
[16:02:30] <deniska> the config format is certainly arcane, and it was a bit hard to look things up
[16:03:13] <tomathy> i liked the apache gui 
[16:03:18] <pyzozord> i think lightness of nginx comes from it's config being limited to a config, no scripting
[16:03:38] <deniska> pyzozord: it has variables, and, like, lua
[16:04:14] <pyzozord> I never actually seen anyone use lua in nginx
[16:04:34] <pyzozord> but other than that hipothesis I don't know why I feel like nginx is lighter than apatche

[16:07:06] <deniska> tomathy: a typical setup I use for python websites is nginx <-> gunicorn <-> python wsgi application written in django or another framework
[16:07:33] <tomathy> cool
[16:07:49] <tomathy> you recommend django then
[16:08:07] <pyzozord> deniska: why gunicorn in the middle?
[16:08:21] <tomathy> so nginx is a server?
[16:09:06] <Decker> so say I want to (or for someone else to) make a program that can plot aribtrary graphs based on multipart functions; graphing calculators have a fixed increment usually for one of the axis
[16:09:08] <deniska> tomathy: it's an http server, which you can configure to relay some URLs to other web servers
[16:09:51] <Decker> there is like r-theta polar representation that desmos supports; but it's still not showing the result of moving a R and Theta, but the r is always dependant on theta as an iterator

[16:10:16] <deniska> pyzozord: that's how traditional python web apps work. Web app exposes a WSGI interface, which then you use with something like gunicorn or uwsgi
[16:10:32] *** Joins: JanC (~janc@user/janc)
[16:10:38] <Decker> so - would you like setup arbitrary axis to do a new iterator?  Sometimes continuous and somtimes sparse?  (like go for every poing beteen -10 and 10 or ever 0.1 from -10 to 10
[16:10:57] <deniska> pyzozord: which transforms incoming http requests into wsgi calls which is then handled by a framework like django
[16:11:27] <pyzozord> so nginx can't handle wsgi directly?
[16:11:45] *** Joins: NEYi (~NEYi@109.251.216.38)
[16:11:47] <deniska> pyzozord: I don't think so. Apache can with mod_wsgi, but it's not really recommended nowadays
[16:12:08] <Decker> nginx is a 'reverse proxy'  it handles the frontend request and relays/dispatches to some actual handler; this lets one place handle HTTPS and then connect internally as http
[16:12:21] <Decker> so your application doesn't have to worry about the certs, and it's configured in one place
[16:12:37] <Decker> it can be configured to do static requests
[16:12:39] <deniska> https termination is a common use of nginx, sure
[16:13:27] <pyzozord> I see so wsgi is python's abstraction of cgi/fcgi etc
[16:13:46] <pyzozord> but it's specifically a python's idea, I thought it was more of a general internet protocol
[16:14:07] <deniska> pyzozord: it has a similar idea to fastcgi, but it's not an IPC mechanism
[16:14:10] <tomathy> how do these companies send you texts to confirm you email address?

[16:14:25] <pyzozord> deniska: is not?
[16:14:43] <pyzozord> deniska: so the wcgi is a package thats part of the application itself?
[16:15:20] <deniska> pyzozord: well, it specifies "something has to call this python function with this and that parameter and expect these actions to be performed"

[16:17:30] <deniska> tomathy: email is a somewhat complex of a topic. There're many ways of dealing with it, ranging between running your own webserver, or asking a 3rd party service to send emails on your behalf
[16:18:08] <tomathy> i was thinking we need a website to cure lonliness
[16:18:15] <tomathy> everyone lonely puts their phone number on it

[16:18:51] <tomathy> the genuinely lonely people would get harassed
[16:19:01] <deniska> pyzozord: wsgi specifies the interface of this function. Then frameworks like django can implement this function and be plugged in any wsgi server implementation. Or you can implement a wsgi server which calls into this function, and then it will work with any wsgi-capable web framework like django, flask, bottle etc

[16:19:40] <pyzozord> deniska: so is wsgi and django two separate processes?
[16:20:06] <deniska> pyzozord: wsgi isn't a process, wsgi is a specification which basically says "this function should exist in your python code and act that way when called"
[16:20:32] <deniska> pyzozord: then django is a package which along all the things it does, also provides this function to be called
[16:20:33] <pyzozord> I mean what you called a "wsgi server"
[16:21:05] <deniska> pyzozord: depends on the implementation, typically it runs python in the same process as the one which listens to incoming requests
[16:21:18] <deniska> pyzozord: it may however create subprocesses and/or threads
[16:21:30] <pyzozord> I see
[16:21:52] <pyzozord> when it creates a subprocess, how does it communicate with the django process?

[16:22:40] <deniska> pyzozord: there's no separate django process, there's, say, 4 forked gunicorn processes sharing a socket, perhaps each also running 4 threads for example
[16:23:11] <deniska> each running django code
[16:23:18] <pyzozord> ah I see

[18:32:16] <Rounin> Thedarkb1-Work: We~ll, I'm mainly a backend developer, but hidden form fields will work for one session in one window, right... But the moment the user closes it, you'll need cookies or local storage or whatever... Of course, the form fields can reference something stored on the server, but then that's really the storage mechanism

[20:37:53] <Rounin> Hm, yes... AVL trees are relatively easy to implement... Even if Red/Black may or may not have better performance because of the rarer rebalancing
[20:38:04] <Rounin> Or AA trees or B-trees if you want to rebalance even less

[20:39:10] <Rounin> I still haven't decided who I think should own the keys, though... Like, do you memcpy them or just ask the caller to never free them or what
[20:39:32] <Rounin> I guess if it's just for your own personal code, you can do whatever is most efficient for you
[20:39:49] <Decker> I have a destroy() callback that can be registered, when a node is unlinked the caller gets his key and data and can free them if required
[20:39:52] <Rounin> Or just only allow value-type keys
[20:40:07] <Decker> otherwise it assumes the key shouldn't be freed - some sort of integer or something
[20:40:12] <Rounin> Decker: Ah, that's clever
[20:41:34] <user51> Decker: those are quite the #defines
[20:41:54] <Decker> user51 ya - came from tweaking millions of operations
[20:42:21] <Decker> those two function calls like 10% of the work was just in calling the function - but having them inline was horrible

[23:08:22] <pyzozord> how do you plot slope? is x "position on original graph" and y "slope angle from 0 to 360"?

[23:11:06] <pyzozord> but I don't really know how slope could be represented numerically as a single value
[23:11:33] <bjs> pyzozord: well you have a line,  and the gradient (i.e. `m` in `y = mx + c`) is the "slope"
[23:11:44] <[itchyjunk]> you can have a lot of lines perpendicular to a point
[23:11:46] <bjs> pyzozord: and that is the value you get if you actually compute the value of the differential at a point

[23:12:17] <pyzozord> ooh right
[23:12:21] <pyzozord> i get it

[23:14:26] <pyzozord> i think we just said the same thing essentially
[23:14:48] <[itchyjunk]> ky = mx + c, k is the coffeicient of the linear function
[23:15:03] <[itchyjunk]> m is the coefficient of the leading term of a polynomial mx+c

[23:16:55] <pyzozord> the line that is the slope
[23:17:02] <bjs> pyzozord: when I said "slope" I meant if you have a line `y = mx + c` then the slope is m.  
[23:17:28] <[itchyjunk]> f(x) = mx + c, m is the slope and f(x) the linear function
[23:17:38] <pyzozord> i get that
[23:17:38] <[itchyjunk]> coefficient of linear function would be a term in front of f(x)
[23:17:39] <bjs> pyzozord: to me, the word "slope" meant the gradient (the numerical value) not the whole line. 
[23:17:50] <pyzozord> but now lets say f(x) = x²
[23:18:30] <[itchyjunk]> yed then d/dt (f(x)) = 2x is the function repreenting the slopes of the function f(x) = x^2
[23:18:34] <bjs> pyzozord: so f'(x) (aka d/dx f(x)) is 2x which means if you go to any point on the curve x^2,  and draw a tangent line, the gradient of that tangent line is 2*x
[23:18:38] <bjs> at the point x

[23:21:27] <pyzozord> how do you find that it's 2x
[23:21:39] <bjs> pyzozord: well, that's what calculus does.  It gives us a method to find them
