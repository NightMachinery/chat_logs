[00:42:19] <hoppity> Hi guys, this is my situation. I have a live view with some text input fields which are used for searching. Once a user finds what they want they click on an item and edit said item at which point they are now back art the original parent live view (where they searched).
[00:43:01] <hoppity> How can I have the parent liveview remember the state of the text input fields and not wipe them after the user saves?
[00:43:49] <hoppity> I've tried sending my assigns to the chield live view (the modal component where the user saves) and then back to the parent live view after save but can't get it to work. My assigns just don't make it back to the parent live view.
[00:51:22] <hoppity> I found this which I will try now: https://elixirforum.com/t/nested-livecomponents-how-to-send-message-to-parent-via-top/31915/5

[00:59:13] <hoppity> It's weird, my flash message comes from the child view to my parent fine but not other assigns that I put on the socket...

[01:22:58] <rawtaz> i just found this tool: https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck
[01:24:49] <hoppity> haha
[01:31:27] <hoppity> I'm reading the socket docs but can't understand the purpose of replace: true when using push_patch
[01:39:06] <benwilson512> hoppity: largely just related to whether it adds a history item to the back button or not
[01:39:22] <benwilson512> flash messages use a cookie
[01:39:30] <benwilson512> that's how they persist values between pages
[01:39:49] <benwilson512> when your user clicks on an item are are they taken to a different live view page?
[01:40:16] <hoppity> benwilson512: I figured that I can use push_patch to keep my parent liveview state (the search boxes filled out) but now I have to find a way to actually changed the item that was just edited in the modal so that it shoes the right values in my -now stale, so to speak- parent live view
[01:40:38] <hoppity> shows*
[01:40:42] <benwilson512> Got it. I think you're using "parent" incorrectly here though
[01:41:04] <hoppity> most likely
[01:41:05] <benwilson512> is the edit page a component of the page?
[01:41:09] <benwilson512> or its own page?
[01:41:13] <hoppity> yes it is a component
[01:41:15] <benwilson512> ah
[01:41:16] <hoppity> modal component
[01:41:56] <benwilson512> hm as long as your form component isn't unmounted then and the assign therefore lost it ought to hang around
[01:42:47] <hoppity> using push_patch in my component rather than the automatically generated push_redirect solved my issue with the search boxes being wiped
[01:42:54] <benwilson512> ah yea
[01:42:57] <hoppity> no problem there, it evene keeps my current scroll which is great
[01:43:01] <benwilson512> :+1:
[01:43:46] <hoppity> but now I have a situation where theu ser successfully added a value to an item (via the modal that is now gone) and they are back at the "parent" live view (my index if you will) but the index still shows the item as unafffected. 
[01:43:59] <hoppity> Which is understandable due tu me using push_patch
[01:44:12] <benwilson512> ah
[01:44:21] <benwilson512> yeah you need to tell the parent to re-fetch the item
[01:44:40] <benwilson512> a simple `send(self(), :refetch)` or something from the modal on submit may suffice
[01:44:47] <benwilson512> alternatively
[01:45:05] <benwilson512> if your modal is param based you should get a handle_params fire in the parent
[01:45:38] <hoppity> I was thinking about using send_update for example
[01:45:49] *** Joins: ahappydeath (~ahappydea@user/ahappydeath)
[01:45:57] <benwilson512> does that work from a component to the root live view?
[01:46:22] <hoppity> Not sure,  I am still reading the docs. send() should be sufficient.
[01:46:58] <hoppity> Now, the edited item is part of a list so what would be an efficient way to refetch that particular item only and not the whole list?

[02:12:12] <hoppity> benwilson512: I fixed my issue :)   I used send() then when my liveview received the message I simply refetched all my items which updates my state and just works like magic. As always thank you.
[02:12:22] <benwilson512> :+1: highly recommend that
[02:12:33] <benwilson512> because otherwise you gotta handle the situation where your edit changes whether the item should be in the list or not
[02:12:34] <hoppity> :+1 ?  What is that
[02:12:50] <hoppity> I thought it was some kind of smiley haha
[02:12:58] <benwilson512> ah no that's like a +1 / thumbs up thing

[13:54:58] <serafeim> or it will print only one of them ?
[13:55:27] <rawtaz> cant you just try it?
[13:55:31] * rawtaz dont know
[13:58:30] <serafeim> it's not working as i like (it only prints the error)

[14:59:39] <serafeim> hello friends
[15:00:17] <serafeim> i'm reading this article by chris: https://dockyard.com/blog/2016/05/02/phoenix-tips-and-tricks and it mentions in section "Avoid Task.async if you don’t plan to Task.await" the create code i have in this snippet: https://dpaste.org/0p0w
[15:00:53] <serafeim> i've added the create2 function in the same snippet that is a bit modified. is it possible to clarify what's the difference between create and create2 ? 
[15:01:06] <serafeim> which one should i prefer and why

[15:05:51] <benwilson512> serafeim: I think the first one is fine, but in both cases it isn't clear what your error handling strategy is
[15:06:27] <serafeim> no no let's not discuss about other problems. i just want to udnerstand what's the difference between these two snippets
[15:07:10] *** Joins: nd__ (~nd@ip-176-199-210-130.hsi06.unitymediagroup.de)
[15:07:14] <serafeim> i mean if i were to create that code i'd implement the second one (create2) because it is much simpler and does not mess with Task. is there a reason to use the first one (create) ?
[15:07:34] <serafeim> i understand that from the client side of view the code will execute in the same time
[15:07:38] <serafeim> or not ? 
[15:08:12] <serafeim> the two operations (Facebook.get_token and Twitter.get_token) will run in parallel in the first case ? 
[15:08:39] <benwilson512> serafeim: they will run concurrently yes
[15:08:47] <serafeim> so if the operators are 2 seconds and 3 seconds in the first case it will be 3 seconds and in the second it will 5 seconds
[15:08:52] <benwilson512> yes
[15:08:53] <serafeim> so yes now it makes sence thank you
[15:09:15] <benwilson512> now, this does depend a bit on how your `get_token` functions actually work
[15:09:16] <serafeim> let's suppose i had only one operattion. would it be worth it to run with the Task ?
[15:09:19] <benwilson512> no
[15:09:27] <serafeim> benwilson512: you mean if they deadlock somewhere ?
[15:09:34] <benwilson512> if they use a pool of HTTP connections and that pool is overloaded then it may not actually be faster
[15:09:40] <serafeim> benwilson512: yes i understand
[15:09:51] <serafeim> ok that makes sence thank you
[15:09:57] <serafeim> sense

[20:00:54] <hoppity> Nicd: true, and I did see that in the docs. But you can patch yourself into a different LV no?
[20:01:17] <Nicd> the docs say it's inside LiveView and redirect is to go to another LiveView
[20:02:31] <hoppity> Maye I'm just confused. The code generated by gen.live for example uses redirect when a modal is closed, but I changed that  code to use push_patch instead and now my app is faster.
[20:02:43] <hoppity> So I just did not see a reason to use push redirect.
