[00:00:02] * blkshp is reminded of Jurassic World. Never Ever turn your back on the cage.
[00:02:14] <huf> jurassic $x would be a lot more terrifying with just... you know, people
[00:02:18] <huf> maybe soldiers
[00:02:40] <huf> yeah yeah dinosaurs, but like, they're not *people* :D
[00:02:45] <blkshp> But that would be called People park and im not sure pepo
[00:02:57] <huf> it'd be an interesting movie
[00:02:58] <blkshp> I wont continue that. You took the fun out of it ;)
[00:03:07] <huf> people being kept on an island as a safari thing
[00:03:12] <huf> and then breaking out and murder spree
[00:03:19] <blkshp> I call that the town centre.
[00:03:26] <CuriosTiger> I call that Texas.
[00:03:39] <blkshp> Where you go shopping and get an exciting round of weirdness from the other 'inhabitants'
[00:03:41] <CuriosTiger> ok, that's unfair
[00:03:53] <CuriosTiger> I really should be more inclusive and call it "the USA".
[00:04:02] <huf> oh wait
[00:04:06] <huf> you mean the US is this safari?
[00:04:54] <CuriosTiger> Feels like it sometimes.
[00:05:10] <CuriosTiger> I mean, there have been shootings in stores I go to
[00:05:23] <CuriosTiger> that's not "just on the news" anymore, even if I thankfully wasn't there at the time.
[00:06:16] <huf> even our super homophobic frothing at the mouth bigots only threw rocks, eggs and firecrackers
[00:06:23] <huf> not a single firearm
[00:07:12] <huf> it was nearly all eggs too
[00:07:13] <blkshp> Why would you throw a firearm?
[00:07:17] <CuriosTiger> Yeah, I think you have to go to Afghanistan or Yemen or something to find gun violence rivaling the US
[00:07:35] <huf> so basically the real super extremists of the extremists threw a handful of rocks and firecrackers
[00:07:37] <CuriosTiger> blkshp: They're made of metal, so they're pretty heavy for their size. Getting hit by one hurts.
[00:07:51] <blkshp> lol
[00:08:05] <huf> the mainstream was just eggs
[00:08:11] <huf> rotten eggs using egg casters
[00:08:22] <blkshp> unless they belong to Die Hard 2 when apparently they're made of porcelain
[00:08:22] <bin> CuriosTiger: no, you can just visit our neighbors to the south.
[00:08:46] <bin> Do people forget about the lower majority of NA and that SA exists
[00:08:47] <bin> ?
[00:08:49] <CuriosTiger> bin: There is that. 20 years ago, I went to Mexico without hesitation. These days...well, there's hesitation.
[00:09:10] <CuriosTiger> bin: To be fair, much of central and south america is safer than the US.

[00:09:26] <bin> I don't think that's true
[00:09:49] <CuriosTiger> I traveled all over Costa Rica without feeling the least bit concerned.
[00:10:05] <bin> You're male though
[00:10:08] <CuriosTiger> Granted, that's cherrypicking a bit.
[00:10:36] <bin> I've been to lots of tourists areas of North/Central America and felt very safe
[00:10:40] <CuriosTiger> bin: True. I was referring specifically to gun violence here. Sexual assault and rape are problems I mostly don't have to worry about.
[00:10:42] <bin> but those were designated safe areas.
[00:11:00] <CuriosTiger> Yeah. I've been to areas like that in Mexico and Guatemala among others.
[00:11:04] <bin> another thing to take into account when it comes to numbers is repoting
[00:11:06] <bin> reporting*
[00:11:08] <CuriosTiger> but I would not feel safe just roaming Mexico on my own.
[00:11:25] <bin> Yeah I definitely would not
[00:11:29] <CuriosTiger> OTOH, I also don't feel safe when someone walks into my grocery store and kills a toddler and his grandmother.

[00:15:06] <huf> separate fish fork and seafood fork?
[00:15:08] <huf> i'm sorry what
[00:15:20] <bin> I think it would be smart for Mexico to build a wall along its southern borrder
[00:15:24] <bin> iirc they were considering it
[00:16:13] <bin> i've been sat at a table like that except I don't recall the sherry glass
[00:16:32] <StayHungry> 'bin: You're male though' and you're not?
[00:16:37] <CuriosTiger> bin: Most firearm ownership in Mexico -- certainly among the cartels -- is illegal. But such laws require enforcement. Mexico has a huge problem with local police corruption. And others that are beyond my knowledge; I'm not that well versed in Mexican internal affairs.
[00:16:52] <blkshp> the seafood fork would be if your amuse bouche or possibly hors-d'euvres were a prawn
[00:16:56] <CuriosTiger> But your point is well taken; there are certainly other countries in the Americas that have a huge problem with gun violence.
[00:17:18] <bin> Yeah
[00:17:23] <blkshp> bin: no one really likes sherry. I would put a port or brandy glass there
[00:17:34] <CuriosTiger> It's a shame, because Mexico is a lovely country in many ways.
[00:17:48] <bin> CuriosTiger: agreed
[00:17:50] <bin> and blkshp lol fair
[00:17:53] <CuriosTiger> I've been there a number of times -- in recent years only in touristy safe zones -- and people are generally very friendly and welcoming.
[00:17:59] <bin> I love Mexico
[00:18:04] <huf> come here, every place is tourist safe
[00:18:07] <bin> Such a beautiful and rich history

[00:18:53] <CuriosTiger> huf: I've been there. I enjoyed Buda in particular. And I've done many a shopping trip to Györ (sorry, I don't know how to get the right diacritic)
[00:19:14] <huf> it's okay, neither did we until utf8 :D at least not consistently
[00:19:44] <CuriosTiger> I'm concerned about jingoism in Hungary, but I never once felt unsafe there.
[00:19:44] <bin> damn blkshp now you're making me want a 12 course meal

[00:19:55] <blkshp> Me too :D
[00:20:07] <CuriosTiger> You're making me want a steak
[00:20:08] <huf> CuriosTiger: yeah, jingoism is like what we're made of

[00:20:58] <CuriosTiger> Good thing power-hungry rulers never go mad.
[00:21:03] <huf> and I dont think he's insane, he's just a really really awful person who solved the puzzle of hungary

[00:21:21] <StayHungry> LuisP14: huh?
[00:21:23] <CuriosTiger> blkshp: I think that's good for security, but a bit sad at the same time.
[00:21:36] <CuriosTiger> blkshp: Our licenses in Florida no longer have magstripes on them
[00:21:38] <blkshp> It's been 15 years since chip and pin. It's time.
[00:21:44] <CuriosTiger> they used to.
[00:21:47] <blkshp> our licences never did
[00:21:55] <CuriosTiger> I know. It was more a US thing.
[00:22:00] <CuriosTiger> (and Canada too, I think)
[00:22:11] <CuriosTiger> your licenses were these huge booklets forever.
[00:22:17] <CuriosTiger> before they FINALLY went credit card-sized.
[00:22:21] <blkshp> not for 20 years
[00:22:40] <blkshp> mroe than 20 years actually.
[00:23:01] <CuriosTiger> My first license in Norway was a single page at least -- but it was more than 2x the size of a credit card.
[00:23:05] <CuriosTiger> Not very convenient for wallets.
[00:23:13] <CuriosTiger> My first Austrian license -- issued in 2001 -- was SIX pages.
[00:23:14] <blkshp> 23 years ago
[00:23:23] <CuriosTiger> Oh, Hungary modernized before Austria? Cool.
[00:23:35] <blkshp> the last ones were a double side A4 sized piece of paper i think
[00:23:58] <blkshp> But they were removed before my time. We used to have a counterpart licence which was paper but they phased those out too
[00:24:14] <CuriosTiger> I remember reading about UK "counterpart" licenses.
[00:24:16] <CuriosTiger> never saw one.
[00:24:30] <CuriosTiger> but I was a bit annoyed that I had to go get an international driving permit for the UK in 2011.
[00:24:41] <blkshp> they put your penalty point on them
[00:24:48] <CuriosTiger> my Norwegian license should've been enough -- but apparently that doesn't apply to vehicles over 3.5 tons.
[00:24:59] <blkshp> I think i still have mine somewhere.
[00:25:02] <CuriosTiger> even if they're indicated on the Norwegian license with the EXACT same classes the UK license uses.

[00:29:57] <CuriosTiger> 1024. If you say 1000, I will punch you.
[00:30:06] <blkshp> The answer was 1024 and it was correct.
[00:30:22] <StayHungry> CuriosTiger: i see no jingoism in hungary, at least not the gov's level as it is not that sovereign to have an offensive foreign policy, but i see nationalism rise and and related local laws which is ok for a nation state.
[00:30:23] <huf> :)
[00:30:25] <blkshp> I had this conversation the other day how 1mb will always be 1024kb, it was argued!

[22:03:26] <Remavas> so it doesn't matter
[22:03:52] <darsie> .w umbra
[22:03:53] <tinsoldier> umbra — Noun: 1. The fully shaded inner region of a shadow cast by an opaque object., 2. (astronomy) The central region of a sunspot., 3. (chiefly literary) A shadow., 4. (archaic) An uninvited guest brought along by one who was invited. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/umbra
[22:04:15] <nalkri> If the world ended how do you explain my cats?
[22:04:16] <darsie> Is an umbrella the right tool to protect from Sunlight?
[22:04:30] <CuriosTiger> nalkri: Cats transcend spacetime.
[22:04:31] <nalkri> That's generally a parasol
[22:04:38] <darsie> ok
[22:04:39] <nalkri> also “sunlight” doesn't need capitalisation
[22:04:40] <Remavas> as opposed to a parapluie?
[22:04:47] <darsie> ok
[22:04:53] <Remavas> or however you spell that
[22:04:55] <CuriosTiger> parapluvia.
[22:05:02] <CuriosTiger> (Latin: "For rain")
[22:05:13] <CuriosTiger> I like how Spanish calqued it to "paraguas"
[22:05:57] <darsie> Is it wrong to capitalize Sunlight?
[22:06:10] <Remavas> Unless it's a proper noun, yes.
[22:06:15] <CuriosTiger> We generally don't capitalize nouns in English, except proper nouns (names)
[22:06:27] <darsie> Sun is a proper noun.
[22:06:38] <Remavas> but sunlight is not
[22:07:11] <CuriosTiger> "Sun" usually isn't either, unless it's being used as a name, such as in some religious contexts.
[22:07:19] <nalkri> para- is generally “against”
[22:07:24] <nalkri> And Greek I think :þ
[22:07:29] <Remavas> paramilitary?
[22:07:32] <CuriosTiger> yeah, "against the rain" is a better translation.
[22:07:37] <darsie> parachute
[22:07:40] <darsie> against fall
[22:07:44] <nalkri> Against falling
[22:07:45] <nalkri> Yeha
[22:08:03] <CuriosTiger> paramilitaries generally are "against" the military" of an invading country.
[22:08:11] <Remavas> hm, interesting
[22:08:13] <darsie> People who say 'deploy the chute' are saying 'deploy the fall'.
[22:08:28] <nalkri> No
[22:08:30] <huf> they're saying 'chute though
[22:08:36] <nalkri> They're using a shortened form of “parachute”
[22:08:38] <CuriosTiger> whereas people who say "deploy the cute" are requesting cat videos.
[22:09:14] <nalkri> Not necessarily an invading country, rebels can be paramilitaries too
[22:09:16] <huf> you can just get a cat installed at home and it'll broadcast live 3d footage constantly
[22:09:20] <Remavas> That would be one vague way to request cat videos
[22:09:25] <CuriosTiger> But joking aside, words, and particularly word stems, don't necessarily retain their literal meaning as they are borrowed across languages.
[22:09:28] <nalkri> And you can kiss its tummy
[22:09:29] <Remavas> Since different people consider different things cute
[22:09:39] <CuriosTiger> huf: I would actually really like to do that, and would if I didn't have allergies.

[22:12:02] <nalkri> I should avoid anything organised by my country :þ
[22:12:21] <CuriosTiger> I'm trying to get my adopted country to update my name slightly in various government records.
[22:12:25] <CuriosTiger> COVID is complicating that effort.
[22:12:37] <CuriosTiger> everything is by appointment only, and those appointments aren't easy to get.
[22:12:57] <Remavas> damn
[22:13:19] <CuriosTiger> today, I went to one at the Social Security Administration
[22:13:20] <nalkri> I considered changing my surname after moving to my adoptive country, but aspects of the rules made it sufficiently problematic I ended up just not
[22:13:24] <CuriosTiger> except the appointment is actually tomorrow
[22:13:44] <CuriosTiger> nalkri: I just dropped my middle name, since it caused some complications.
[22:14:05] <CuriosTiger> (US middle names are typically a second first name, not a second last name as is customary in Norwegian usage.)
[22:14:07] <LuisP14> well, there are 2 para-
[22:14:22] <LuisP14> (...4 in english)
[22:14:29] <Remavas> I'll probably have to butcher my name as well if I decide to move
[22:14:37] *** Joins: StayHungry (~StayHungr@gateway/tor-sasl/stayhungry)
[22:14:39] <CuriosTiger> I refuse to change my first and last name
[22:14:46] <Remavas> Don't think many countries support the letter ė
[22:14:48] <CuriosTiger> even if I always have to spell them for people.
[22:14:53] <nalkri> Middle names here like in the Anglosphere are extensions of the given name so no problem in that respect
[22:15:18] <CuriosTiger> My middle name was my mom's maiden name.
[22:15:43] <CuriosTiger> In the US, "mother's maiden name" is too frequently used as a convenient password when you call anything from your bank to your university.
[22:15:54] <CuriosTiger> I figured having it printed on all my ID wasn't ideal
[22:16:13] <CuriosTiger> also, the way they concatenate first and middle names on plane tickets caused me to miss out on TSA precheck etc
[22:16:21] <darsie> I have an Umlaut in my last name.
[22:16:25] <CuriosTiger> and theoretically could lead to denied boarding for mismatched names.
[22:17:04] <Remavas> I'll probably just do the same I did in Switzerland, type e instead of ė
[22:17:09] <Remavas> Worked fine enough
[22:17:40] <huf> hah, I remember when they misspelled my name on the plane ticket
[22:17:51] <CuriosTiger> Fortunately, my name doesn't have any Norwegian-specific characters in it.
[22:17:53] <huf> letting an american buy the ticket wasnt the best idea
[22:17:53] <nalkri> I'm not sure what character set is allowed either here or in my country of origin
[22:18:04] <nalkri> I know that name selection is weirdly strict here though
[22:18:14] <CuriosTiger> Some Americans are incapable of groking a foreign name, even when you spell it for them one letter at a time.
[22:18:14] <bin> i wish it were more strict in the US
[22:18:19] <Remavas> I seem to remember that the US only allowed ASCII
[22:18:22] <Remavas> I might be wrong
[22:18:39] <CuriosTiger> bin: So people didn't name their children stupid things?
[22:19:03] <darsie> My passport has an ASCII transcription (?) of my name with my umlaut.
[22:19:09] <huf> eh, it doesnt really help
[22:19:16] <huf> the official list is always full of really bad names
[22:19:20] <nalkri> I have to mispronounce my surname so that people can spell it
[22:19:22] <Remavas> darsie, like ue instead of ü?
[22:19:27] <darsie> yes
[22:19:38] <huf> and people also find ways to pick the worst first name in combination with a particular last name
[22:19:40] <CuriosTiger> Yeah, in passport MRZs, umlauts are transcribed AE for Ä, OE for Ö and UE for Ü.
[22:19:46] <nalkri> And my given name is basically entirely replaced in conversation with a local variant nwo
[22:19:55] <huf> we have a number of Nagy Árpi-s
[22:19:56] <nalkri> *now
[22:19:59] <CuriosTiger> ICAO 9303 governs that.
[22:20:10] <huf> problem is, if you re-wrap that, it's pinagyár (cunt factory)
[22:20:11] <CuriosTiger> and I know this because I was curious about what was in my passport's MRZ and decided to look it up.
[22:20:25] <Remavas> Ah, that whole <<<<< thing at the bottom
[22:20:27] <nalkri> CuriosTiger: FedEx (I think) do that with Finnish ö and ä which aren't the same as the german equivalents at all
[22:20:30] <Remavas> yeah, quite fun to look it up
[22:20:39] <nalkri> It's a completely nonsensical substitution
[22:20:41] <CuriosTiger> nalkri: They're not?
[22:20:48] <nalkri> (By equivalents, I mean the things that look the same)
[22:20:55] <huf> nalkri: how did finnish telegram work?
[22:21:03] <CuriosTiger> nalkri: So Finnish ä sounds different from Swedish ä?
[22:21:08] <huf> cos here, even though writing our ü as ue is ahistorical
[22:21:11] <nalkri> No, they're fronted o and a, which I don't think is what German umlaut does
[22:21:12] <huf> that's how they did it in telegrams
[22:21:12] <CuriosTiger> and likewise for ö?
[22:21:23] <nalkri> Or if it is, then oe and ae don't make sense for German either :þ
[22:21:31] <CuriosTiger> I know Swedish and German ö/ä sound pretty much the same.
[22:21:36] <CuriosTiger> I'm not as familiar with Finnish.
[22:21:57] <CuriosTiger> nalkri: "oe" "ae" "ue" are just conventions for representing those characters within the confines of ASCII.
[22:22:06] <CuriosTiger> they don't imply that there's suddenly an E sound added
[22:22:11] <Remavas> Same as ß is represented as ss
[22:22:20] <Remavas> Though that one actually makes more sense
[22:22:22] *** Joins: Voxel (~Voxel@ip178-67-155-188.onego.ru)
[22:22:26] <Remavas> ä being ae is pretty random
[22:22:32] <huf> is it?
[22:22:33] <nalkri> Huh, the German umlaut is fronting, adding an -e for that is just odd
[22:22:38] <huf> dont the two dots represent the e?
[22:22:38] <CuriosTiger> yeah, because scharfes s (ß) does represent a short s sound.
[22:22:48] <CuriosTiger> nalkri: What would you use instead?
[22:22:52] <nalkri> Especially given ae and ä are both valid and mean different things
[22:23:01] <nalkri> In 2021? I'd use ä
[22:23:10] <Remavas> ay
[22:23:12] <CuriosTiger> nalkri: You need to be backwards-compatible with ASCII.
[22:23:13] <nalkri> Is it 2021? I lose track
[22:23:33] <CuriosTiger> your available characters are a-z and A-Z, 0-9 and the character < as a delimiter.
[22:23:38] <CuriosTiger> (Per ICAO 9303)
[22:23:53] <Remavas> Well easy then
[22:23:57] <Remavas> A0 is the normal a
[22:24:01] <Remavas> A1 is ä
[22:24:14] <darsie> I use the standard (English) Dvorak keyboard layout and transcribe umlauts and scharfes s as ae oe ue ss, unless I really need an Umlaut, like for a wikipedia article title.
[22:24:23] <CuriosTiger> no reason to add a second character for the common case.
[22:24:37] <CuriosTiger> normal A can just be A, A1 could be Ä, A2 could be Æ, etc.
[22:24:48] <Remavas> You'd have some ambiguity
[22:24:51] <CuriosTiger> You just have to get ICAO to adopt that for use in passports.
[22:24:52] <nalkri> I don't think the back vowels are more common particularly
[22:25:03] <Remavas> is A1 ä or A and a 1
[22:25:16] <CuriosTiger> Remavas: Yes, but less than with the current convention. AE, OE and UE all occur in names. A1, O1 and U1 probably don't.
[22:25:25] <Remavas> true
[22:25:52] <CuriosTiger> as such, I think this would be a better convention. But I don't make the rules.

[22:27:36] <darsie> I intentionally destroyed my RFID passport chip with a pulse from a capacitor into a coil.
[22:27:44] <CuriosTiger> nalkri: Unless those words are names, it's probably not an issue in the context of a passport.
[22:27:54] <CuriosTiger> darsie: Why?
[22:27:59] <Remavas> plus it's only an ID card
[22:28:02] <Remavas> It costs like 8.6 Eur

[22:31:04] <CuriosTiger> nalkri: The US Congress has at various times attempted to limit dual citizenship.
[22:31:18] <CuriosTiger> Unfortunately for Congress, any attempt to do so violates the 14th amendment of the US constitution.
[22:31:25] <nalkri> I wish I could swap out my citizenship now
[22:31:29] <nalkri> (Not to US, obvs)
[22:31:33] <CuriosTiger> And no Congress has to my knowledge attempted to do so through a constitutional amendment.
[22:31:42] <Remavas> good luck with that lol
[22:31:51] <CuriosTiger> As a result, such laws have repeatedly been struck down as unconstitutional
[22:32:09] <StayHungry> anyone met 'new oxford style manual' in pdf?
[22:32:15] <CuriosTiger> The result is that the US does allow and recognize dual citizenship, even though there are still some old laws to the contrary on the books.
[22:32:38] <CuriosTiger> those laws have no legal effect in the wake of a series of Supreme Court judgments, most famously Afroyim v. Rusk.
[22:32:48] <CuriosTiger> And I"m sure that's more than you ever wanted to know about the US stance on dual citizenship.
[22:32:55] <darsie> A child born to Austrians is an Austrian. If it's born in the USA, it's also a USAnian.
[22:32:59] <bin> CuriosTiger: it depends somewhat though. You can't have dual citizenship with North Korea or Iran, for example
[22:33:40] <CuriosTiger> bin: That's because North Korea and Iran won't allow it. US law contains no such prohibition, and in fact cannot without changing the 14th amendment.
[22:33:58] <CuriosTiger> There are other limitations, for example, US passports are no longer valid for travel to North Korea.
[22:33:59] *** Joins: Rashad (~textual@37.202.99.134)
[22:34:06] <bin> no I think if we have sanctions against a country you can't have dual citizenship via the state department or something

[22:34:33] <bin> right
[22:34:36] <CuriosTiger> bin: But state department regulations do not trump the Constitution
[22:34:45] <Remavas> Ah, countries forbidding dual citizenship. I am definitely not a citizen of such a country. Though talks have long been going on to repeal such laws.
[22:34:52] <CuriosTiger> so they cannot add a clause depriving you of a citizenship there, much as they would like you.

[22:35:29] <CuriosTiger> In the examples you cited, it becomes a non-issue, as neither Iran nor North Korea permits dual citizenship. Both countries would probably treat obtaining US citizenship as tantamount to treason.
[22:35:37] <bin> hm well maybe they misunderstood when they emigrated then 
[22:36:09] <CuriosTiger> bin: Oh, no. People from North Korea and Iran who become US citizens do lose their birth citizenship. But that's due to the laws of North Korea and Iran, not due to US law.
[22:36:29] *** Quits: Rashad (~textual@37.202.99.134) (Client Quit)
[22:36:38] <CuriosTiger> Also, if you're Iranian by birth and you fly to Teheran on a US passport, expect a LONG jail sentence.
[22:36:42] <bin> they had to renounce supposedly, although it's posisble that they misunderstood the oath as being the same as renouncement which isn't
[22:36:54] <bin> not my personal experience, so idk
[22:37:19] <CuriosTiger> bin: The US oath of allegiance contains a renunciation clause. But again, due to supreme court precedent, it's without legal effect under US law (some foreign governments do recognize it )
[22:37:29] <bin> right
[22:37:38] <darsie> What if an Iranian gives birth to a child in USA. It will have USA citizenship. Will Iran deny it Iranian citizenship?
[22:37:45] <Remavas> Yeah, the oath always confused me on that matter
[22:37:46] <bin> it's not even explicit renunciation iirc (although I'd have to look it up)
[22:37:53] <CuriosTiger> Most foreign governments, however, require renunciation of citizenship to take place in front of their own consular officials according to their own laws.
[22:38:08] <darsie> Getting rid of USA citizenship is hard, I heard.
[22:38:09] <CuriosTiger> darsie: I believe in that situation Iran will make the child choose one or the other.
[22:38:16] <CuriosTiger> It's expensive.
[22:38:32] <darsie> How will a newborn choose?
[22:38:41] <Remavas> bin, I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen;
[22:39:05] <Remavas> darsie, the parents will decide I presume
[22:39:05] <bin> https://www.us-passport-service-guide.com/iran-entry-requirements.html
[22:39:17] <huf> even the potentates?
[22:39:20] <bin> so according to this "If U.S. citizens were born in Iran, became a naturalized Iranian, or were born to Iranian parents, they will be considered Iranian citizens and subject to Iranian law unless the government has recognized a formal renunciation of citizenship."
[22:39:21] <huf> is nothing sacred then?
[22:39:36] <CuriosTiger> darsie: In some cases, they choose when they reach the age of majority. In some cases, parents have to choose on their behalf. Not sure about Iran specifically.
[22:39:42] <Remavas> huf, Only the holy federal government of the United States of 'Murica
[22:39:48] <bin> Remavas: oh but that doesn't say renouncing citizenship, just allegiance and fidelity
[22:40:01] <CuriosTiger> there are some complications
[22:40:15] <CuriosTiger> like a child born in the US to Iranian parents might travel to Iran to visit his grandparents and find himself conscripted.
[22:40:24] <bin> Basically if your parents are Iranian, Iran will claim you as a citizen unless they denounce 
[22:40:29] <CuriosTiger> such problems has, indeed, been one of the arguments against dual citizenship
[22:40:52] <Remavas> if you're a citizen, you are subject to your country's laws, so you'd have some "allegiance and fidelity", at least that is how I interpret the clause
[22:41:02] <Remavas> But as Tiger said, unconstitutional
[22:41:07] <Remavas> therefore cannot be enforced

[22:41:25] <nalkri> If you gain Finnish citizenship young enough you have to do national service
[22:41:28] <CuriosTiger> I find the oath to be a little odd.
[22:41:34] <Remavas> nalkri, same here in Lithuania
[22:41:52] <Remavas> CuriosTiger, it does make sense historically, but nowadays, it is weird
[22:41:58] <nalkri> Only men though
[22:42:03] <Remavas> same here
[22:42:03] <CuriosTiger> Not sure how they define "allegiance", but obviously, I still have feelings about Norway (positive ones) even after becoming a citizen
[22:42:25] <CuriosTiger> Remavas: Historically, it was based on this notion that you could only be the loyal subject of one king.
[22:42:30] <nalkri> I don't know how I would have reacted if I'd been subject to such a thing, I like to think I'd have refused military service at least
[22:42:32] <Remavas> exactly
[22:42:33] <huf> cant you go to the sheriff and confess your sins?
[22:42:37] <Remavas> But that has changed sin
[22:42:37] <CuriosTiger> nalkri: Same in Norway.
[22:42:42] <nalkri> I can't be loyal subject as any kings
[22:42:43] <huf> and he'll assign you ten "i pledge allegiance"-es
[22:42:45] <nalkri> *of any
[22:42:45] <Remavas> huf, yes, and then you end up in lavatory
[22:42:51] <Remavas> also called prison
[22:42:53] <bin> CuriosTiger: basically if Norway goes to war against the US you've sworn to support the US and not Norway
[22:42:59] <CuriosTiger> nalkri: And while the US has no conscription currently, males in the US under age 26 are required to register with the selective service.
[22:43:07] <CuriosTiger> including permanent residents and even illegal aliens.
[22:43:26] <Remavas> resident aliens too?
[22:43:26] <CuriosTiger> bin: Except that I refused to swear to bear arms on behalf of the United States
[22:43:38] <bin> i don't think you can do that
[22:43:46] <CuriosTiger> Remavas: Resident aliens, yes. Temporary residents (ie. student visa etc) are exempt, however.
[22:43:51] <bin> it's part of the responsibility of being a citzen
[22:43:53] <bin> citizen*
[22:43:55] <CuriosTiger> bin: I did it, April 2nd, 2021.
[22:43:58] <nalkri> Isn't it more that they currently don't conscript anyone but still have conscription on the books?
[22:43:58] <Remavas> I mean he obviously somehow got the citizenship
[22:44:06] <bin> CuriosTiger: and they didn't say "okay fuck you get out"?
[22:44:11] <CuriosTiger> bin: There's basically a conscientious objector exception permitted to that part of the oath.
[22:44:11] <bin> that's... surprising.
[22:44:19] <bin> Why are we accepting immigrants that wouldn't fight for us
[22:44:30] <huf> cos there's no conscription
[22:44:30] <Remavas> Can't you reject the renunciation clause of the oath then
[22:44:31] <CuriosTiger> bin: I had crossed "no" on my application to that particular question, and i had to discuss it at my naturalization interview.
[22:44:32] * Remavas sighs
[22:44:34] <huf> the poor will fight for you anyway
[22:44:40] <huf> the rich wouldnt fight no matter what

[22:45:45] <CuriosTiger> "Must show opposition to clause (or clauses) based on religious training and belief or deeply held moral or ethical code. Applicant may provide an attestation or witness statement."
[22:45:58] <bin> so it's like a religious exemption 
[22:46:03] <CuriosTiger> I apparently demonstrated such deeply held beliefs to the satisfaction of the interviewing officer
[22:46:09] *** Joins: Rashad (~textual@37.202.99.134)
[22:46:09] <CuriosTiger> since I was permitted to take a modified oath
[22:46:11] <blkshp> I wouldn't fight for you either.
[22:46:26] <CuriosTiger> it started as a religious exemption to accommodate, specifically, Quakers. It has since expanded to permit moral conviction as well.
[22:46:32] <CuriosTiger> but it has to be deeply held, and it has to be universal.
[22:46:36] <blkshp> I wouldn't fight for England most likely either
[22:46:40] <Remavas> I might foght for a defensive war, but not the type of wars the US is fighting
[22:46:42] <CuriosTiger> you don't get to say "I will only bear arms if I agree with the government"

[22:47:35] <bin> Yes, that's fair
[22:47:46] <CuriosTiger> bin: Yet getting to that requires an oath modification
[22:47:53] <CuriosTiger> and getting that modification is a privilege, not a right
[22:47:57] <nalkri> Member of the German armed forces don't have to obey orders they don't agree with

[22:48:03] <nalkri> *members
[22:48:08] <bin> CuriosTiger: yeah that makes sense.
[22:48:10] <CuriosTiger> you have to demonstrate to the interviewing officer that you have that deeply held conviction, whether on religious or ethical grounds
[22:48:16] <bin> right
[22:48:17] <CuriosTiger> it's not just "i don't wanna"
[22:48:27] <bin> yeah, I completely misunderstood what you meant at first
[22:48:30] <CuriosTiger> in fact, probably a quarter of my interview was on this subject.
[22:48:33] <StayHungry> marianne: you missed a message from me :)
[22:48:46] <bin> Israel has a similar thing with their conscription. If you hold pacifist beliefs or have a religious exemption you can serve in other ways
[22:49:05] <Remavas> I think every civil society has such an exemtpion
[22:49:10] <Remavas> I know my country does
[22:49:22] <Remavas> s,exemtpion.exemption,
[22:49:24] <CuriosTiger> Yeah. Natural-born citizens don't go through naturalization, but the Selective Service does have similar procedures for conscientious objectors.
[22:49:37] <CuriosTiger> You still have to register, but you can request non-combatant service if there ever is a future draft
[22:49:43] <bin> yeah now you can
[22:49:43] <CuriosTiger> and then the request would be evaluated by the draft board.
[22:49:44] <Remavas> I find the whole idea of Selective Service off-putting
[22:49:52] <Remavas> "We don't have a draft, but we kinda do"
[22:49:56] <CuriosTiger> Yep. You couldn't during Vietnam -- or rather, you could, but it was rarely granted.
[22:50:09] <bin> yeah my dad joined the navy to avoid being drafted into the army
[22:50:13] <CuriosTiger> and that was controversial to the point of causing American conscientious objectors to flee to Canada as refugees
[22:50:18] <bin> cowardssss
[22:50:21] <CuriosTiger> the fallout is a large portion of why we don't have a draft anymore.
[22:50:32] <Remavas> the '60s were a wild time for draft dodgers
[22:51:40] <CuriosTiger> bin: I think it goes beyond cowardice. I think it's unreasonable to ask people to die for their country, particularly when the country itself isn't being invaded (Vietnam was fought abroad) and particularly when the people giving those orders aren't risking their own hides (politicians and monarchs who order wars rarely if ever fight in them personally.)
[22:51:45] <StayHungry> 'conscientious' is difficult to spell for sure :)
[22:52:02] <CuriosTiger> Remavas: I understand the reason for the Selective Service.
[22:52:05] <bin> eh I'm biased and have mixed feelings as I come from a line of people who fought for the country, including fighting for it being formed 200 years ago
[22:52:14] <CuriosTiger> if you face a crisis, you need some mechanism for defense. I get it.
[22:52:19] <Remavas> As I said, I think most people would be ok fighting a defensive war against invaders
[22:52:25] <nalkri> It must take a lot of courage to be a conscientous objector, I really don't know if I'd have had  it
[22:52:27] <Remavas> But going overseas is something else
[22:52:42] <bin> nalkri: how do you figure
[22:52:44] <CuriosTiger> If the US is invaded, I will help in every way I possibly can EXCEPT shooting at people.
[22:52:52] <CuriosTiger> I am not willing to have human lives on my conscience.
[22:53:04] <nalkri> Now I'm too old for any plausible country to want me anyway, but even leaving aside the probability of punishment, the social censure can be secure
[22:53:13] <CuriosTiger> and yes, this is all theoretical for me as well.
[22:53:37] <CuriosTiger> I am not registered with the Selective Service -- all my time in the US before age 26 was in valid non-immigrant status, as I had not yet qualified for a green card.
[22:53:44] <CuriosTiger> and I am too old to be drafted under current law.
[22:53:53] <CuriosTiger> even so, I was not willing to take an oath unless I meant it.
[22:54:05] <CuriosTiger> if my oath modification had not been granted, I would not have become a citizen.
[22:54:07] <bin> I very much respect you for that, CuriosTiger 
[22:54:08] <nalkri> I couldn't describe myself as an abcolute pacifist, but I'd certainly refuse military service for the UK
[22:54:16] <nalkri> (if it were to be mandated)
[22:54:18] <Remavas> I'll probably be able to dodge my country's draft due to the fact I am a student
[22:54:25] <Remavas> And I'll be too old after my studies
[22:54:40] <blkshp> I would if i could but if it were that or they'd shoot me, give me the gun.
[22:54:44] <CuriosTiger> nalkri: So the question I sometimes get asked is, if a gunman was pointing a gun at me and my only chance at survival was to kill him first, would I?
[22:54:57] <CuriosTiger> and the honest answer is, if it was a life-on-the-line self-defense situation, I might.
[22:55:07] <CuriosTiger> but I would do everything in my power to avoid being put in that situation in the first place.
[22:55:12] <nalkri> blkshp: That's where the “like to think” comes in for me :þ
[22:55:50] <blkshp> Yeah, more "I'd rather not if it's alright"
[22:55:52] <CuriosTiger> bin: Thank you.
[22:56:20] <marianne> StayHungry: hello I am sorry
[22:56:46] <CuriosTiger> bin: It was also important to me NOT to ask for an exemption to the clause "To perform noncombatant service in the U.S. armed forces when required by the law." I won't kill people, but I'm absolutely willing to do my part in every other way.
[22:56:59] <bin> I appreciate that.

[22:57:08] <CuriosTiger> so I did say that portion of the oath, even though I technically would not have had to once my waiver was granted.
[22:57:12] <nalkri> Though hey, if someone is trying to get you to kill people and has just handed you a gun there are other obvious options presenting themselves
[22:57:28] <bin> Seriously, I have a lot of respect for you, and even moreso now. Not only did you do it 100% the right way, but you made sure that when you made the oath it was something you meant sincerely
[22:57:33] <nalkri> Including but not limited to just never shooting at a human
[22:57:37] <bin> Too often people take "oaths" non-seriously 
[22:57:46] <bin> and it's really a nice refresher to see the opposite
[22:57:53] <CuriosTiger> bin: Becoming a citizen is a big deal. I wanted it to be meaningful.
[22:58:04] <CuriosTiger> It's a bummer I had to do it wearing a mask and with none of my friends or family present
[22:58:06] <CuriosTiger> but that's COVID for you.
[22:59:19] <Remavas> heh, seeing naturalized citizens is always a breath of fresh air
[22:59:31] <Remavas> They are always proud to be [insert citizenship]
[22:59:37] <CuriosTiger> bin: BTW, the link I gave you above is to the USCIS Policy Manual. This is basically the guide USCIS officials follow when deciding whether to grant or deny citizenship or other immigration benefits.
[22:59:41] <Remavas> Unlike some natural citizens
[22:59:49] <blkshp> nalkri: i'll take Roger Murtaugh's advice and "shoot 'em in the leg!"
[22:59:57] <Remavas> bad advice
[23:00:00] <nalkri> blkshp: I hope you mean the recruiting officer
[23:00:06] <nalkri> Rather than someone who's done you no harm
[23:00:10] <CuriosTiger> bin: It was published after a FOIA request by the ACLU a number of years ago. There are redacted chapters, but there's still a lot of interesting material if you want to know more about how immigration and citizenship decisions are made.
[23:00:12] <bin> CuriosTiger: oh wow you did it during covid! that's awesome but also very sad :(
[23:00:27] <blkshp> nalkri: well again it depends on the scenario
[23:00:28] <CuriosTiger> bin: My naturalization ceremony was April 2nd, 2021.
[23:00:36] <CuriosTiger> (Thankfully not on April 1st.)
[23:00:54] <bin> haha
[23:00:59] <CuriosTiger> Remavas: To be clear, I am still proud to be Norwegian as well.
[23:01:03] <bin> My coworker's mom did hers last year
[23:01:09] <bin> also April I think
[23:01:10] <Remavas> CuriosTiger, I don't doubt that at all
[23:01:19] <CuriosTiger> even though that was just the result of winning the birth lottery.
[23:01:28] <CuriosTiger> it's amazing how much of our lives are beyond our control
[23:01:42] <CuriosTiger> what would my life be like if I'd just happened to be born in Nigeria instead of Norway?
[23:01:56] <Remavas> blkshp, just threaten the recruiter with the gun he gave you, then take him hostage
[23:02:00] <CuriosTiger> *completely* different, and probably with much fewer opportunities.
[23:02:14] <blkshp> Remavas: I'm not sure it'd work out too well.
[23:02:20] *** blkshp sets mode: -o blkshp
[23:02:26] <Remavas> better than shooting him
[23:02:31] <CuriosTiger> besides, recruitment at gunpoint is some Taliban shit.
[23:02:43] <Remavas> Plus if he develops Stockholm syndrome you can have a new husband
[23:02:50] <nalkri> I'm not sure how I could be “proud” of being English or British or European or whatever
[23:02:57] <CuriosTiger> The US Armed Forces uses some pretty deceptive propaganda aimed at high school kids, but they don't THREATEN.
[23:03:08] <nalkri> It's not like it's an achievement or even a decision
[23:03:17] <TechTest> nalkri: exactly
[23:03:40] <nalkri> If I ever become legally Finnish I might feel differently about that
[23:03:42] <CuriosTiger> nalkri: That is definitely true on a philosophical level. Even so, are you completely indifferent when the UK achieves something notable?
[23:03:45] <TechTest> why someone should feel proud about something they haven't achieved themselves
[23:03:59] <TechTest> your nationality is isn't something you achieve
[23:04:02] <CuriosTiger> whether it's a victory in the Olympics or improving society at home in some way?
[23:04:06] <nalkri> CuriosTiger: Not completely, but that doesn't make me “proud to be British”
[23:04:29] <nalkri> Oh, I'm completely indifferent to the Olympics except that they should be stopped post haste :þ
[23:04:32] <CuriosTiger> I'm proud of Norway for their achievements
[23:04:37] <bin> I can say that my life would be very different if I'd been born male. Who knows where I'd be now, maybe dead or in prison lol
[23:04:38] <blkshp> I am English, I'm happy to be English but, right, I don't think I'm proud.
[23:04:42] <CuriosTiger> even if I had little or no hand in those achievements
[23:04:46] <TechTest> why would you feel proud if your country achieves something if you weren't involved in it?
[23:04:50] <Remavas> What are the Olympics again?
[23:04:58] <bin> a sporting competition
[23:04:58] <CuriosTiger> There are other feelings besides pride
[23:05:07] <blkshp> I can be proud 'of' England.
[23:05:08] <nalkri> It's sports day organised by a transnational authoritarian cabal
[23:05:22] <CuriosTiger> gratitude, perhaps, at the opportunities Norwegian society has offered me.
[23:05:22] <blkshp> TechTest: you don't have to be involved to be proud of something.
[23:05:23] <Remavas> nalkri, Oh, sounds boring af
[23:05:31] <nalkri> With explicitly (though deceptively) stated political messaging that bans political messaging
[23:05:49] <TechTest> blkshp: then why being proud? it's like saying I'm proud for the sun that's shining
[23:05:56] <Remavas> ah yes, like allowing some countries to participate in the name of their country
[23:06:02] <CuriosTiger> Happiness, even.
[23:06:07] <CuriosTiger> I'm certainly happy the sun is shining.
[23:06:10] <Remavas> whilst others have to do with participating in differently named teams
[23:06:16] <blkshp> Because I am involved in the country. 
[23:06:20] <CuriosTiger> Remavas: Russia brought that upon themselves.
[23:06:22] <blkshp> Part of it

[23:11:35] <nalkri> Though I enjoyed how much the Finnish entry was on the radio less
[23:11:35] <Remavas> If you look past the bullshit
[23:11:41] <Remavas> It is quite enjoyable
[23:11:43] <nalkri> I like the bullshit
[23:11:51] <nalkri> Funny costumes and such
[23:11:53] <Remavas> Schadenfreude I presume?
[23:12:08] <nalkri> No, sharing in the delight at the absurdity of life
[23:12:09] <CuriosTiger> My favorite Eurovision winner, btw, was Germany with Nicole's Ein Bisschen Frieden. And no, not just because of the lyrics. The song is incredibly catchy.
[23:12:16] * LuisP14 opens his can of worms and pours it on the table
[23:12:27] * CuriosTiger puts the worms back in the can and goes fishing.
[23:12:30] * blkshp eats
[23:12:43] <nalkri> I don't think I know that, but I've only got into Eurovision in relatively recent years

[23:13:16] <nalkri> Nah, never trust a Sir

[23:15:10] <nalkri> It's alright, yeah

[23:18:59] <CuriosTiger> haha
[23:19:26] <nalkri> I still like that we don't know Plato's name incidentally
[23:19:54] <rud0lf> his name was Jake
[23:20:03] <CuriosTiger> I did not know that.
[23:20:10] <rud0lf> i'm trolling you :)
[23:20:13] <CuriosTiger> I had thought his name was Platon.
[23:20:24] <rud0lf> oh you didn't say that to me :[
[23:20:29] <CuriosTiger> rud0lf: I was responding to nalkri
[23:20:34] <rud0lf> i realised
[23:20:59] <CuriosTiger> rud0lf: If you were going to make a hoax about Plato's name, you should pick something that could've passed for a name in ancient Greek.
[23:21:19] <rud0lf> i was aiming for an obvious joke :)
[23:21:27] <nalkri> “Plato” is broad, and either was his wrestling nickname or a reference to his forehead or to the bredth of his knowledge
[23:21:34] <nalkri> But yes “Platon”
[23:21:47] <nalkri> I like to think it was his wrestling name on account of the henchitude
[23:22:13] <CuriosTiger> His true name was supposedly Aristocles (Ἀριστοκλῆς), meaning 'best reputation'. <-- as the rest of the paragraph makes clear, this is at best an educated guess.
[23:25:25] <StayHungry> CuriosTiger: why exactly did you decide to stay in the USA? money?
[23:26:29] <CuriosTiger> Certainly not money alone. I could make the same or more in Europe.
[23:26:51] <CuriosTiger> (in fact, I made more money in my last job in Norway than I made in this current job when I started. Although I've since received some substantial raises.)
[23:27:10] <CuriosTiger> It's a very complicated question that is hard to answer in a sentence or two.

[23:34:59] <pussipupu> It's interesting how different tastes in climate are
[23:35:03] <marianne> Flott :)
