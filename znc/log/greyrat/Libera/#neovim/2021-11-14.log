[18:09:37] <GlennOberlander[> kylo252[m]: it's not w11, and not sure if wslg is being used. I tried to setup/enable the x forwarding, but it didn't seem to work. Followed these: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61110603/how-to-set-up-working-x11-forwarding-on-wsl2
[18:09:41] <sunjonSenghanBri> it's not really a "special plugin"
[18:09:49] <GlennOberlander[> and some other tutorial on windows site

[18:11:08] <GlennOberlander[> sunjonSenghanBri: I don't see xterm in the list, but I assume it does?
[18:11:09] <kylo252[m]> GlennOberlander[: there isn't much to do from the client side, you might have a blocker from the server side if X11 forwarding isn't enabled
[18:11:59] <kylo252[m]> just do `ssh -Y hostname -vvv` and check for errors in the messages
[18:12:08] <GlennOberlander[> kylo252[m]: ok. So basically, I just need to make sure my X11 forwarding is setup? If I didn't go through WSL2, it'd probably work fine?
[18:12:22] <kylo252[m]> if you the server is old/wonky, you might need to try `ssh -X host -vvv` instead
[18:12:23] <GlennOberlander[> kylo252[m]: what is -vvv?
[18:12:59] <kylo252[m]> basically, none of this is neovim specific. just make sure that xclip/xsel/whatever works on the other side

[19:01:31] <clason[m]> sorry, yes

[19:03:46] <clason[m]> plugins, of course
[19:03:48] <bard[m]> I considered something with inputs or my keyboard, but it's not like I'm pressing keys besides initiating the initial macro, and the first action at least goes through.

[19:22:20] <_xor> Basically, I use multi-mon with tmux sessions and sometimes I'll forget that I already have a given file open in another window. Instead of warning if, ideally it would just open it read-only and show me a warning message.

[19:26:30] <_xor> Doesn't it detect it via temp/swap file?
[19:26:46] <dumbdemic[m]> _xor: My version of nvim synces files when I edit them in different instances, I disable swap and don't have any issues with stale data.

[19:28:30] <bard[m]> If you open the same file in a second nvim it warns you and makes you quit, delete the swp file, or choose to "edit anyway".
[19:29:04] <clason[m]> if you _do_ use swap files, you will get a warning, and can choose "open read-only"
[19:29:05] <bard[m]> ah, and open read-only is one of the options also
[19:29:09] <_xor> Yeah
[19:29:15] <_xor> That's what I'm doing now.
[19:29:20] <bard[m]> so I think _xor just wants that to be picked automatically
[19:29:30] <_xor> Yup, that's it.
[19:30:01] <_xor> 75% of the time it's for a quick read-only reason that I'm opening it, so basically just open it as read-only and show a message or indicator or something. I'll just find what I'm looking for a quit without editing.

[19:30:35] <_xor> No biggie though, I'll just turn off swp and let the read/write instance warn me when I switch back to it if it was edited.
[19:31:44] <clason[m]> set up an autocommand that checks for a "lockfile" in some temp directory; if it does not exist, write it and set a new autocommand that removes it on exit; if it does exist, set `nomodifiable`

[21:16:42] <kylo252[m]> mingw32 != 32bit builds AFAIK
[21:18:00] <clason[m]> yes, but that's not the point here, is it?
[21:18:01] <kylo252[m]> * ~~mingw32 !=, * builds AFAIK~~ I might be wrong, so hold on..
[21:18:29] <clason[m]> (there's also MSVC32, but that's also dead...)
[21:18:46] <kylo252[m]> clason[m]: exactly, but I get what you mean now that it's unreachable anyway
[21:19:08] <kylo252[m]> clason[m]: good riddance :) 
[21:19:32] <kylo252[m]> I was hoping to bootstrap clang instead of gcc, but it's a PITA 
[21:20:22] <kylo252[m]> would be interesting to use UCRT: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/porting/upgrade-your-code-to-the-universal-crt?view=msvc-170

[21:23:28] <clason[m]> Sounds like some headache, for no actual gain?
[21:23:56] <clason[m]> I might be wrong, but then it would be good to state which Neovim issue this would fix...
[21:24:27] <kylo252[m]> kylo252[m]: notice that this is an official recommendation ^
[21:24:48] <clason[m]> well, yes, but MS would also recommend everybody use Windows

[21:28:43] <bfredl> do all our deps work well with the URCT? including luajit?
[21:29:36] <ironhouzi[m]> Does anyone have any experience with the lua/rust reimplementation of vimwiki? I've been using the viml plugin for some time and I'm happy to keep using it, but it would be interesting to see if there were any real benefits from the new tech..
[21:29:37] <clason[m]> > Binaries linked with MSVCRT should not be mixed with UCRT ones because the internal structures and data types are different.
[21:29:37] <clason[m]> sounds like a huge red flag to me...
[21:29:43] <kylo252[m]> bfredl: if you're asking me, then I couldn't actually verify that because I would have to re-write most of the cmake target 
[21:30:29] <bfredl> so someone has to do a lot of work to prove that URCT is a good idea to start with..
[21:30:44] <kylo252[m]> hence "interesting" :) 
[21:30:58] <clason[m]> that's not my definition of "interesting"...
[21:31:09] <clason[m]> "tedious", maybe...
[21:31:11] <kylo252[m]> but `clang` still has ways to go anyway, so not that fun yet
[21:31:16] <bfredl> if someone are interested to do the work, let them do it :D
[21:31:32] <clason[m]> some people like "tedious" :P
