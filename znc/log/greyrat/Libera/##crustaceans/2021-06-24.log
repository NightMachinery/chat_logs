[00:07:02] <riv> didn't relize til 2 days before getting it that it's your own cells that create them from the mRNA!

[00:10:21] <wrl> riv: i thought that was how the viral vector vaccines (AZ, j&j) worked
[00:10:36] <prussian> there were a few "subunit" vaccines that were being tested.
[00:11:26] <prussian> which is basically that. antigens in the vaccine
[00:11:32] <wrl> prussian: yeah, novavax is the frontrunner, as i understand
[00:11:34] <prussian> or proteins. whatever you have it
[00:12:03] <ngoldbaum> wrl: the viral vectors infect your cells to tell them to produce spike proteins, the mrna vaccines cause cells to directly produce them using “natural” processes
[00:12:21] <wrl> ngoldbaum: yeah :)

[01:52:36] <pja> companion_cube: UK is sensible about such things. Or possibly not? Alcohol consumption is steadily dropping amongst the young though.
[01:53:55] <companion_cube> oh no, are millenials ruining binge drinking too??
[01:54:03] <companion_cube> or generation Z
[01:54:19] <ngoldbaum> millenials are ruining fetal alcohol syndrome
[01:56:19] <pja> companion_cube: As is well known, millennials are ruining everything, but this is Gen Z I think.
[01:57:07] <pja> Less alcohol, less sex IIRC. Those two things may or may not be connected...
[01:57:27] <pja> Also fewer friends I think, which is sad. I suspect the Internet is to blame, it usually is.
[01:58:17] <Brekkjern> Also the fact that there really isn't any place to hang out
[01:58:32] <companion_cube> ah that's really sad

[12:31:19] <quanticle> Which is why all the libertarian responses to the pandemic have had this common theme of, "Look at how good big business did! They got a vaccine out in record time!"

[12:49:37] <gerikson> it's funny, at least in Sweden gov agencies are tasked with being as clear as possible, so if you don't get something you're wikfully trying to misread something

[12:51:16] <quanticle> Brekkjern: God, I wish that was the US. Here our laws are designed by lobbyists and lawmakers to be as ridiculously difficult to parse as possible because of a combination of people being unable to fundamentally agree on what needs to be done and people wanting to have loopholes and carve-outs for their pet causes.
[12:52:08] <quanticle> Clarifying the law would make it plain to certain groups of people that the law doesn't actually allow them to do whatever it is they're doing
[12:52:17] <quanticle> (esp. w.r.t. taxes)
[12:53:27] <Brekkjern> I mean... There's still ambiguity. There will always be.
[12:53:34] <quanticle> It's all intentionally kludgy because that's how you can say you're doing one thing while actually doing the opposite.
[12:53:41] <Brekkjern> It's also possible to misunderstand how the laws would be applied
[12:54:26] <gerikson> quanticle: norway and Swedne use the continental system, where the laws are basically written down beforehand, while the US uses case law to acutally decide the outcome
[12:54:45] <gerikson> but the language used to be more technical/obscure
[12:55:37] <quanticle> gerikson: In theory, case law. In practice, administrative law. A lot of laws passed by the US Congress are literally just fill-in-the-blanks for the implementing Executive Branch agency to fill out as they wish in a separate rule-making process.

[12:56:49] <Brekkjern> It only means you can receive additional punishment if you commit another crime
[12:57:22] <quanticle> That's kind of like how it works here as well.

[12:58:29] <quanticle> Calling someone a racial slur isn't illegal in and of itself, but it's an aggravating factor if there's a crime already being committed

[17:17:33] <hoistbypetard> i feel your rule needs some exception for threads where certain posters provide a third of the mass
[17:22:29] <ngoldbaum> can someone explain to me why demonstrating proof of vaccination for everyday things is some kind of massive human rights violation?
[17:22:52] <hoistbypetard> no. because it is not.
[17:22:54] <companion_cube> ohno, pg is antivax?
[17:23:04] <companion_cube> jjuran: I live in DC yes! :)
[17:23:08] <hoistbypetard> you have to demonstrate proof of vaccination to go to fucking school
[17:23:11] <ngoldbaum> that seems to be a base assumption of many thread participants
[17:24:07] <hoistbypetard> my guess is that they either feel school is some kind of human rights violation, are too old to remember what had to happen to go to school, or have never been responsible for sending someone to school
[17:25:05] <prussian> because attestation of vaxx status is basically a coercion as far as the concern is. which isn't entirely untrue.
[17:25:45] <hoistbypetard> prussian: but we have to attest that we've had our MMR vaccines to go to school
[17:25:45] <ngoldbaum> is stopping at a red light coercive? wearing your seatbelt?
[17:25:52] <ngoldbaum> just trying to find where the line is
[17:26:11] <prussian> hoistbypetard: do we? I remember giving very lax demonstration and passing right through
[17:26:34] <prussian> hell. there was a whole freak out over banning "religious" vaccine exceptions for such things.
[17:26:34] <ngoldbaum> i had to provide vaccine records at my public school
[17:26:59] <hoistbypetard> the only pass i can see would be forging my pediatrician's signature or forging evidence that we are exempt
[17:27:15] <prussian> well, sameish as well. it was basically just some old records that could have been easily self-made though. hardly call it a strong attestation.
[17:27:41] <ngoldbaum> i mean you can buy fake cdc vaccine cards on amazon…
[17:28:02] <prussian> anyhow. I don't understand why people hate the "vaxx." People must have forgotten the whole polio saga.
[17:28:03] <hoistbypetard> requiring you to actively commit a crime (forgery) to bypass a requirement is on the strong side, IMO, even if the crime is not that difficult
[17:28:20] <ngoldbaum> but tbh much better to just get a vaccine and protect yourself from a deadly virus
[17:28:32] <hoistbypetard> ^^
[17:30:14] <prussian> anyhow. idk bro.

[17:33:29] <hoistbypetard> Brekkjern: I actually see his point in that one
[17:33:48] <hoistbypetard> we don't really need to hand all that data over
[17:33:49] <companion_cube> prussian: polio, rabbies, even measles…
[17:33:50] <prussian> as an american I can confrim I don't own my medical data and get weird spam mail asking me to sign up for some chronic illness program bs
[17:33:55] <companion_cube> I mean there are good reasons why we vaccinate infants
[17:34:05] <prussian> companion_cube: yes.
[17:34:28] <mouseghost> im getting 2nd dose soon, but a lot of things around that vaccination action is really... scary to me
[17:34:29] <prussian> not sure if people are getting the polio one anymore. I'm pretty sure I never got it
[17:34:41] <companion_cube> not even in a bundle?
[17:34:44] <hoistbypetard> we could just have some digitally signed attestation that we've had the vaxx since 12/1/2020 to turn in
[17:34:51] <prussian> MMR is pretty common
[17:34:57] <hoistbypetard> but the infrastructure to support that is nontrivial
[17:35:19] <hoistbypetard> mouseghost: what vaccine did you get?
[17:35:21] <mouseghost> but i dont understand: why even make things to support some kind of certificates?
[17:35:31] <mouseghost> hoistbypetard, pfizer; could get only that, because im under 18
[17:36:47] <companion_cube> hoistbypetard: isn't that what the covid "passports" are about?
[17:36:48] <prussian> it's basically just a virus that's payload isn't effectively a "quine." not sure what is scary about it.
[17:36:55] <hoistbypetard> don't worry too much about the second dose. most people i know got that one. my sister had the worst reaction of them all, and for her it was a mid-grade fever that made it hard to sleep for one night.
[17:37:14] <companion_cube> the second dose gave me fever for one day
[17:37:18] <companion_cube> a bit like a flu vaccine, really
[17:37:26] <prussian> same as ^
[17:37:31] <prussian> was annoying
[17:37:44] <hoistbypetard> companion_cube: they have too much info in them, IMO
[17:37:44] <prussian> though the alt would be a week of a fever instead
[17:38:00] <hoistbypetard> all they need is a date and an authority
[17:38:02] <companion_cube> seems like some ID and the dates of the shots?
[17:38:03] <mouseghost> hoistbypetard, well, so far the first dose was literally nothing for me (maybe a bit of runny nose/cough or something like that), so i think that the second one will also be of similar magnitude
[17:38:05] <prussian> hoistbypetard: agred
[17:38:12] <companion_cube> I guess you do need the name to match actual ID
[17:38:19] <companion_cube> otherwise it's easily stolen
[17:38:21] <companion_cube> "stolen"
[17:38:30] <hoistbypetard> right
[17:38:32] <mouseghost> whats scary to me is the ability to segregate people tbh

[17:38:49] <mouseghost> idk
[17:39:08] <companion_cube> it's not like segregating on some unchangeable attribute though
[17:39:20] <prussian> just have it depend on an TOTP value at access time. that way the theft/sharing would have to be within 30 seconds
[17:39:44] <prussian> hmm
[17:39:47] <mouseghost> well, it isnt now, but ive read enough conspiracy theories to have that thought that someone might think of it one day
[17:40:22] <companion_cube> I mean I don't really see a problem with it :/
[17:40:30] <prussian> the more and more I go on with my life and see how the chinese live, I honestly think people overthink it
[17:40:41] <companion_cube> depends for what,  but there are places where you shouldn't be allowed to go if you're unvaccinated by choice
[17:41:25] <hoistbypetard> it makes me cranky that there's more outrage over "we need to show proof of vaccine" than there is over "that fucker isn't taking a shot that could make this whole virus NOT A THING"
[17:41:29] <martian67> mouseghost:  people have been getting segregated for thousands of years
[17:41:37] <martian67> you dont need some electronic record to accomplish that
[17:41:45] <companion_cube> hoistbypetard: right?
[17:41:50] <mouseghost> would that matter if a substantial amount of people got the shot? companion_cube
[17:41:58] <mouseghost> hoistbypetard, oh yeah thats also...
[17:41:58] <companion_cube> yes ofc
[17:42:08] <companion_cube> if 70 or 80%  did, there would be proper herd immunity afaiu
[17:42:13] <mouseghost> i often forget that these people exist uh

[17:52:32] <prussian> I'm sure there are people in my family watching this shit endlessly, that's the real tragedy I guess.
[17:52:42] <hoistbypetard> companion_cube: on july 4th you do fireworks

[17:54:16] <ngoldbaum> wyoming has permanent huge illegal fireworks stores off of I-25 at the colorado border
[17:54:26] <prussian> nice.
[17:54:31] <ngoldbaum> i remember going there with my dad in the 90s to buy mortars

[17:55:57] <companion_cube> I'm new to this
[17:56:11] <hoistbypetard> that all depends on what you mean by "work"
[17:56:15] <companion_cube> :D
[17:56:24] <prussian> noooo. my work is "demasking" that means the office is probably going to be open soon.
[17:56:31] <companion_cube> I mean I have a neighboor upstairs
[17:56:43] <companion_cube> should ask them if they're ok with fireworks piercing their floor.
[17:57:03] <prussian> you'd just drive to some random street and shoot them off.
[17:57:10] <companion_cube> what's "CT"
[17:57:16] <prussian> Connecticut
[17:57:35] <companion_cube> ohhhh
[17:57:50] <companion_cube> well I still have no idea where that is but that's fine

[17:58:58] <prussian> ya CT is basically open
[17:59:04] <prussian> no more masks since like May
[17:59:41] <hoistbypetard> where we are is pretty good. i still make my kids wear masks in stores, though
[17:59:46] <companion_cube> too many small states
[17:59:59] <companion_cube> they should merge these together and make DC its own state 🙃
[18:00:21] <companion_cube> hoistbypetard: departments are useless, no one talks about them, is the difference :p
[18:00:24] <prussian> lol
[18:00:34] <prussian> only DC could be made a state at this point
[18:00:42] <companion_cube> people don't write "Foo city, <departement>"
[18:00:47] <prussian> unless Canadian or Mexican provinces are annexed

[20:49:19] <hoistbypetard> learning about that seems much more fun than arguing about vaccines on the internet. well played!
[20:49:54] <riv> lol
[20:50:05] <riv> in a way its related to vaccines
[20:50:24] <riv> the whole anti-vaccine thing could be seem as another internet-borne contageon
[20:50:34] <companion_cube> it was a bit before that, no?
[20:50:44] <riv> I learned about this weird made up disease called morgellons today
[20:50:45] <companion_cube> andrew wakefield went viral through the news
[20:50:47] <companion_cube> may he rest in hell
[20:50:52] <riv> because wikipedia links

[20:51:25] <hoistbypetard> IMO the whole thing pre-dates its internet spread, but that is a very interesting way to look at it
[20:51:29] <martian67> <mouseghost> especially that what you've said, kinda implies that someone who is vaccinated cannot transmit the virus. but others say that they can, so ye who knows
[20:51:30] <martian67> they can
[20:51:35] <martian67> but its a much lower chance
[20:51:37] <martian67> which is the point

[20:57:27] <mouseghost> martian67, aight, though i still dont believe that there is another thing that a person owes to society

[20:59:32] <hoistbypetard> mouseghost: i disagree there. i feel that part of being a decent part of the community is avoiding things i know could sicken others
[21:00:51] <hoistbypetard> we could argue about whether I "owe" it to society to be a decent member of the community, i guess... but doing things that don't hurt me and help others avoid sickness is unquestionably decent IMO
[21:01:20] <hoistbypetard> the fact that those things also help me avoid sickeness makes them a basic survival instinct :)
[21:05:01] <companion_cube> in france at least, cars cannot have some ornaments that would be dangerous to pedestrians in case of collision
[21:05:11] <companion_cube> so that's an example of not putting others at risk

[21:09:33] <mouseghost> also this specific thing is related to something passive, not active -- i am against actively making someones life miserable
[21:09:37] <companion_cube> given how contagious this shit is…
[21:09:57] <mouseghost> for example holding a party in the flat on the next floor is bad
[21:12:37] <edm> companion_cube: like extended axles covered in cutting spikes?
[21:13:11] <companion_cube> edm: oh god yes
[21:13:12] <mouseghost> also its doing something vs not doing something being "bad"
[21:13:15] <companion_cube> why the fuck is that even a thing
[21:13:38] <mouseghost> im just grumpy about not having friends, tbh :)
[21:15:19] * mouseghost ehhhhs
[21:15:24] <edm> companion_cube: is it a thing?
[21:15:33] <edm> i was actually thinking of what the chariots had in Gladiator
[21:16:12] <companion_cube> not with spiles
[21:16:14] <companion_cube> spikes
[21:16:19] <companion_cube> but extended axles, sure
[21:18:48] <mouseghost> i think that having friends and being happy from it is benefiting from the society hm
[21:18:57] <mouseghost> but otherwise?
[21:18:58] <mouseghost> hm
[21:19:18] <mouseghost> apart from family or someone hm

[21:20:20] <mouseghost> idk
[21:20:24] <mouseghost> complicated stuff
[21:21:03] <hoistbypetard> while having friends and being happy form it is certainly a benefit of society...

[21:22:10] <ngoldbaum> i think if a lot of effort was spent on improving indoor ventilation that would have more benefit than a lot of what’s happened in the last year

[21:22:44] <hoistbypetard> the not being torn apart by wolves part?
[21:22:51] <mouseghost> ngoldbaum, i suggest making sure soap is available first ;v
[21:22:58] <mouseghost> hoistbypetard, both wolves and food
[21:23:13] <hoistbypetard> i don't think that can be fully paid back by money... i think that requires some participation in creating the conditions that make it possible
[21:23:26] <ngoldbaum> all the handwashing and hand sanitizer stuff in the last year was mostly wasted effort
[21:23:30] <hoistbypetard> but i'm just some asshole on the internet :)
[21:23:41] <ngoldbaum> handwashing helps but it’s a respiratory infection…
[21:23:50] <mouseghost> hoistbypetard, hm?
[21:24:48] <hoistbypetard> ngoldbaum: i think we've under-served improving indoor ventilation in the past year, and that's likely to bite us in an entirely foreseeable way
[21:25:06] <wrl> ^
[21:25:13] <wrl> ventilation is the real issue
[21:26:05] <hoistbypetard> personally, i've been chewing on my local school officials about that. not about the fact that our kids only went to school 2 days a week.
[21:26:33] <mouseghost> hmm, i am for better ventilation, yes
[21:26:38] <mouseghost> dust is terrible to me
[21:27:59] <mouseghost> the soap thing was a local allusion i guess :D
[21:28:03] <mouseghost> school one :V
[21:28:09] <mouseghost> tho we do have soap (usually)
[21:28:40] <hoistbypetard> soap is important. i bet the wolves are kept out of your living space too :D
[21:29:00] <mouseghost> wolf as a pet?
[21:29:08] <mouseghost> well, i prefer cats
[21:29:12] <mouseghost> deffy a cat-person

[21:29:27] <mouseghost> are you a fish
[21:29:37] <mouseghost> hm
[21:30:04] <hoistbypetard> the suggestion that wolves could be kept as pets was bait for me to go off on a rant about keeping wild animals as pets... not going to take it :)
