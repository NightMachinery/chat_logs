[00:12:41] <gentwo> having issues with dropdown select, i am getting items from database as object. https://dpaste.org/eGYs#
[00:12:50] *** Quits: Akimb (~Akimb@86.100.13.100) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[00:14:39] <TinoDidriksen> What issues? Though all elements will be selected from that.
[00:16:07] <__adrian> obvious issue is you're not properly encoding anything. https://php.net/htmlspecialchars
[00:16:17] <__adrian> but what's your question?
[00:16:24] <gentwo> TinoDidriksen: i am able to see the items, but when i submit not sure it's selected any items
[00:17:06] <__adrian> so when you look at the form submission, the item you selected is not present?
[00:17:32] <gentwo> __adrian: nope
[00:17:38] <__adrian> are other form fields?
[00:18:32] <__adrian> also https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option#attr-selected
[00:19:53] <TinoDidriksen> And what is that span doing there? <optgroup> exists for such stuff.
[00:20:10] <gentwo> __adrian: i am not sure if i did it correctly, if(empty($data['jobtitle'])){$data['jobtitle_error'] = 'Please enter jobtitle';}
[00:20:30] <__adrian> i don't see how that's relevant
[00:20:43] <__adrian> are other form fields present in the form submission? or is it completelyempty?
[00:21:06] <gentwo> with an if condition empty($data['jobtitle_error'])) always complains the field is empty, there are other fields and it works as expected
[00:21:32] <Blondie101010> the code you showed does not refer to $_POST
[00:21:50] <Blondie101010> so you need to clarify your problem (for yourself)
[00:21:56] <__adrian> this sounds like a separate question, but is quick to answer: if you try to use an item in an array that does not exist, that's an error.
[00:22:08] <__adrian> echo $array["no such item"]  // this is an error. don't do that.
[00:22:40] <__adrian> the proper solution in this case is probably not to provide a default. rather, if there's no error, then don't show an error message.
[00:23:00] <__adrian> BUT back to your question about the option not being submitted:
[00:23:02] <__adrian> are other form fields present in the form submission? or is it completelyempty?
[00:23:32] <gentwo> there are other fields
[00:24:02] <__adrian> then look at the ofrm submission in the browser (use dev tools). see if the item is submitted at all.
[00:24:18] <__adrian> if it's not submitted, then the problem is with your form.
[00:24:51] *** Joins: DevAntoine (~DevAntoin@78.196.234.32)
[00:25:05] <__adrian> look at the form and see if it's correct + as you expected. NOTE i mean, look at the _actual output_ ("view source"), NOT the generated dom ("inspect element").
[00:25:54] <gentwo> __adrian: is my select and value options are correct?
[00:26:11] <__adrian> i have not idea. i haven't seen them.
[00:26:19] <__adrian> YOU need to look at the output.
[00:26:50] <__adrian> (though as i mentinoed above, no, the way you're using the `selected` attribute is not correct)
[00:27:43] <gentwo> i am not sure how to do that selected part
[00:27:50] <__adrian> the fact that you're not properly encoding your output... that could easily result in malformed html. you should definitely check (AND fix it).
[00:28:03] <__adrian> gentwo: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option#attr-selected
[00:29:15] <TinoDidriksen> The selected attribute is to tell the browser which option(s) should be initially selected when the page loads. Setting it to the ID is completely wrong.
[00:29:27] <__adrian> setting it to any value is wrong
[00:29:32] *** Quits: DevAntoine (~DevAntoin@78.196.234.32) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[00:29:46] <__adrian> and setting it on every option is definitely wrong (doesn't even make sense)
[00:29:51] <gentwo> __adrian: Ouch! that mean all wrong what i did there
[00:30:19] <Blondie101010> just read on how it works, test a simple html form to validate your learning
[00:30:21] <__adrian> the reason i'm not focusing on the selected attr is that while yes, it's wrong, it's not what would cause your form to be broken
[00:30:40] <__adrian> you need to be far more worried about not encoding your output
[00:30:59] <__adrian> and you need to do the basic troubleshooting of _looking at your output_ and checking that it's correct
[00:32:01] <gentwo> thanks, hopefully i will figure this out

[18:46:03] <no_gravity> How does composer hande it, when dependency A and dependency B both depend on C but on different versions of C?
[18:54:44] <biberu> no_gravity: this is called the diamond dependency problem, you might find something with that search term
[18:55:01] <no_gravity> biberu: I find a ton, but not for composer.

[18:55:24] <no_gravity> biberu: I tend to think that composer does not handle it at all. Simply because there is no easy way to do so in PHP.

[18:56:04] <biberu> i don't know how composer handles it
[18:56:44] <no_gravity> I guess it can't. As in PHP you cannot do "import x as y". Since the name is not defined by the consumer but by the code via "namespace".
[18:58:04] <no_gravity> So in case of a conflict, I think the way to go is to manually do some trickery in composer.json
[18:59:10] <biberu> might be possible to try to find a best match, redirect to some version, simply error out until the conflict is resolved by e.g. changing the versions of A or B, etc., but don't know what it would attempt, if anything
[18:59:41] <biberu> don't their docs mention it?
[19:00:36] <no_gravity> I dunno. I have put enough thinking into it now :)
[19:00:46] <no_gravity> It was mainly a philosophical question.

[19:16:06] <Duality> hey
[19:16:16] <Duality> I have questions about php-fpm and running pools
[19:17:49] <entuland> if the pool is running you have a leak, duct tape may do :P
[19:17:58] <entuland> just ask and see if anyone can help, seriously
[19:18:14] <Duality> just wondering if it were the right place
[19:19:11] <Duality> so i am trying to setup php-fpm with a config and this page: https://gist.github.com/fyrebase/62262b1ff33a6aaf5a54 says to put it in /etc/php5/fpm/poold/ i have no fpm directory
[19:19:35] <Duality> so maybe i am missing something that is not installed or something else has to be done ?
[19:20:20] <entuland> that page reads "/fpm/pool.d/", not "/fpm/poold/"
[19:20:32] <entuland> just in case you checked for that path verbatim
[19:20:36] <Duality> well the fpm directory doesn't exist
[19:20:49] <entuland> ah yes, sorry, misread that part
[19:21:03] <entuland> can't tell, I've seen fpm discussed here a few times
[19:21:24] <biberu> unrelated to your question, but i guess you're aware that 5 is old?
[19:21:41] <Duality> yea
[19:21:46] <Duality> i have 7.4 installed
[19:21:51] <entuland> maybe someone knows, you could try asking in #ubuntu as well, as it seems something tied to FPM possibly not being running properly
[19:22:00] <entuland> or maybe 7.4 behaves differently
[19:22:46] <Duality> well i have this other server (that i didn't configure) that does have it
[19:23:05] <Duality> there it's this: /etc/php/7.4/fpm/pool.d
[19:23:19] <Duality> but on mine the fpm directory simply doesn't exists :)
[19:24:25] <entuland> is that folder supposed to be generated automatically no matter how you install php-fpm?
[19:25:05] <entuland> cause if it's supposed to be there, your installation may simply be borked / incomplete
[19:25:11] <biberu> is fpm installed? :)
[19:26:49] <Duality> this is what i have installed libapache2-mod-php7.4
[19:27:18] <biberu> well, that's not fpm :)
[19:27:52] <Duality> no i realized
[19:28:23] <Duality> i can't find it installed not sure why the other machine has this: php7.4-fpm
[19:28:30] <Duality> this seems to be lacking on my side
[19:29:42] <Duality> yep
[19:29:44] <Duality> that was it
