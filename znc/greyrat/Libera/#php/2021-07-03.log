[12:17:00] <pycode> i have two questions about php, general questions. I always used Python for ML/AI, Python has an huge ecosystem on that field. The problem with Python is that web framework are really poor compared to php frameworks (for many reasons). Now, my problem is that i have models and library that are running on python, and now i have to build a website to deploy such models/library to make them available for users. I tried with Django but it
[12:17:01] <pycode> has some limitations, The only PRO is that it runs in Python so I don't need anything else to run my libraries. But now I should build a more solid website and I would like to try out a php framework. I have old memories of CakePHP, but now I'm not sure what the best frameworks are and especially how (from PHP) to invoke Python (RPC? Other solutions?)
[12:17:12] <pycode> Pardon for the long message :)
[12:18:57] <pycode> i heard Laravel has huge ecosystem, but there is Spiral that it claims to be my next web framework for the next 25 years :)
[12:19:08] <AllenJB> CakePHP is kind of a niche framework IMO - it's a "full fat" RAD setup. I don't believe it has general wide adoption.
[12:19:31] <AllenJB> Laravel is full of magic and you may get into trouble later.
[12:20:08] <AllenJB> My personal preference is to use a microframework such as Slim, then pull in whatever else I need via Composer
[12:23:39] <dag> slim requires quite a lot of dev skills imho. not suitable for beginners
[12:23:55] <dag> but use a microframework indeed
[12:24:26] <dag> he probably doesnt need a framework at all. depends on the spec etc.
[12:28:12] <pycode> at the moment my "problem" is that all AI/ML are python
[12:28:59] <pycode> so the things are: 1. try another python framework if exists..... 2. find a wayt to call python in a good way without running a shell command everytime
[12:29:09] <pycode> i need to call such models many times
[12:29:37] <pycode> i heard about RPC but i never used...i am a AI/ML guy :) but now i need to deploy the job
[12:30:41] <pycode> dag, yes i need a framework, but it is not just a web page, i need to handle user registration/login/APIs etc
[12:31:19] <AllenJB> It depends what you're doing. You could use message queues to communicate with Python - the Python code runs as queue workers, processes a job from the message queue and sends back the response on a queue (RPC style queues) You can use a queue server like RabbitMQ to handle the queues.
[12:31:30] <pycode> yes i can do that without a framework but, i think is better to adopt it...and i would like to go deep into web development, so i would like to understand, what at the moment is the widest used framework, it seems laravel, no?
[12:31:43] <pycode> AllenJB, i need "real time" response
[12:31:59] <Blondie101010> I agree with AllenJB...  I'd probably use RabbitMQ for this as well
[12:32:36] <pycode> i heard about SPiral, is good? it has a connection to Go via RPC, so i think i can follow a similar solution for Python too
[12:32:45] <pycode> Blondie101010, RabbitHQ for realtime?
[12:32:59] *** Quits: seand (~seand@69.54.136.33) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[12:33:00] <pycode> i mean...the users requests some info i need to call my model and return the response
[12:33:10] <pycode> it is not a background process
[12:35:55] <Blondie101010> we don't know what you do but you mentioned calling it many times, which seems to imply batch jobs, right?
[12:36:11] <Blondie101010> or is a real client receiving each response?
[12:36:53] <Blondie101010> also note that you quoted "real time" for a reason, as it is always defined by the allowed response time, not the fact that the connection is uninterrupted
[12:36:58] <biberu> it also sounds like you'd want to keep python processes running rather than restarting it for each call needed from your web app
[12:37:17] <biberu> guessing that real time means synchronous?
[12:37:23] <pycode> Blondie101010, many times means that i need to call the models often because it provide a kind of statistics
[12:37:45] <pycode> everytime the user ask for the page i need to call that model and provide fresh data
[12:37:54] <pycode> Blondie101010, yes
[12:37:58] <pycode> real client
[12:38:18] <Blondie101010> ok so for live requests, it depends how the processing takes
[12:38:38] <pycode> biberu, exactly too, i do not want to call .py file everytime...
[12:39:13] <pycode> Blondie101010, i know it takes time, i will test it later for sure, but, as i wrote i should understand what i need to avoid shell calls to .py file,
[12:39:19] <pycode> i can give rabbithq a try
[12:39:39] <Blondie101010> using a queue doesn't prevent you from replying to the client as soon as possible
[12:39:55] <pycode> i thought it was not good for "real time" but just for background processes, but i never tried it so i am surelly wrong
[12:39:56] <Blondie101010> same with a DB
[12:40:08] <biberu> pycode: I'd look for some way to get a server running on the python side, could be e.g. http or some queue, then just call it from php
[12:40:10] <pycode> Blondie101010, cluld you explain it a little more?
[12:40:10] <Blondie101010> but a queue is faster and easier to manage
[12:40:18] <pycode> i can reply and then load additional data later?
[12:40:35] <Blondie101010> don't know what you mean by that
[12:42:03] <Blondie101010> send a JSON encoded message that contains the clientId, and request parameters to your jobs queue, and the worker (Python script) processes the requests as they come in and sends a JSON encoded message with the clientId and the response
[12:42:31] <Blondie101010> it could be sent to a specific queue for output, for simplicity
[12:42:31] <pycode> Blondie101010, pardon, i mean... you said "using a queue doesn't prevent you from replying to the client as soon as possible", what do you exactly mean? that a queue system is fast enough for realtime? i thought it as not because if the queue is long it will takes more time to process, so maybe an http server on python
[12:43:10] <Blondie101010> realtime is not a clear definition of anything
[12:43:17] <biberu> he means synchronous
[12:43:35] <pycode> Blondie101010, PHP --> Rabbit --> Python script --> Rabbit ---> PHP ? or do you mean that python will response to the user directly ?
[12:43:38] <Blondie101010> it doesn't apply much more
[12:43:46] <Blondie101010> pycode:  sure
[12:43:53] <biberu> e.g. the php side needs the response to proceed, if i understand him correctly
[12:44:06] <pycode> yes synchronous
[12:44:07] <biberu> perhaps that could be changed, perhaps not
[12:44:07] <pycode> yes
[12:44:09] <pycode> exactly
[12:44:12] <AllenJB> As long as you have a free queue worker, a new job will be processed and returned "instantly" (or as long as it takes the code to run plus a few millis for queue comms)
[12:44:12] <pycode> to create the report
[12:44:17] <pycode> php needs the data from that model
[12:44:18] <Blondie101010> yeah that's why I said the simplified version would output to a specific queue
[12:44:45] <Blondie101010> that way the php script can listen to that queue and respond to the client without any more dispatching
[12:45:15] <Blondie101010> like PythonScript sends response message to the queue "$clientIdResponse"
[12:45:33] <Blondie101010> that would justify some regular cleanup tasks, but that's no big deal
[12:45:54] <pycode> Blondie101010, ok so please just to make a stupid example to undertand it better... i have a.php that sends the job to queue and then ends its process....then when the job on the queue ends Rabbit will call b.php to send the response to the user?
[12:46:08] <Blondie101010> I just gave you enough information to get going
[12:46:18] <pycode> oh i was writing, let me read :)
[12:46:20] <Blondie101010> if you knew how to use RabbitMQ, it would take 15 minutes to do

[12:46:31] <AllenJB> It may help to look at RabbitMQs docs & examples for RPC-style queues: https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-six-python.html
[12:47:59] <pycode> RPC, Ok...i will look at those examples, ok i will test it but when Rabbit "runs" python does it means that it call a .py file or is there a more sophisticated solution to run python faster
[12:48:56] <Blondie101010> replace "queue" by "channel" in my example and you get their example
[12:50:05] <Blondie101010> note that I'd still use a queue for the jobs
[12:50:10] <biberu> pycode: you'd need a processor/responder in python that continuously waits for requests from php and call into your python libs (ofc those should be written with that in mind)
[12:50:24] <Blondie101010> that way if you ever want to add one or multiple workers, you can without changing anything else
[12:51:06] <pycode> Blondie101010, i think i can add more rabbit workers without problem right? ok i will read it as "channel" :D
[12:51:29] <Blondie101010> it depends on what you do, but it is easy enough
[12:53:22] <pycode> ok so to execute those processes i will use Rabbit, and now, what about the framework? which should i use? i would like to study a framework and works with it for a good span of time :) as i wrote i need to handle db, user registration/login and control panels

[12:56:24] <pycode> Blondie101010, have you tried SPiral? i heard good thing about that framework

[12:59:50] <pycode> ok
[12:59:51] <pycode> Blondie101010, do Rabbit and Gearman do a similar job?
[13:00:29] <Blondie101010> Gearman is more task oriented while RabbitMQ is more generic
[13:00:40] <Blondie101010> same kind of principles
[13:01:59] <pycode> Blondie101010, now i do a stupid asumption :) but reading the doc here: http://gearman.org/examples/reverse/
[13:02:03] <biberu> pycode: consider getting a poc of the python<->php communication going before you invest too much time in frameworks
[13:02:23] <pycode> it seems that it run a gearman server that call my python function without starting (and loading) a .py file again and again
[13:02:32] <pycode> so it seems more "efficient"
[13:02:45] <pycode> my big problem is that loading such models takes time
[13:02:56] <pycode> i can not load the model for each request

[13:05:47] <Blondie101010> pycode:  I think you don't understand the principle of a message queue
[13:05:58] <Blondie101010> the queue doesn't run your python script
[13:06:08] <Blondie101010> the python script subscribes to a queue
[13:07:13] <pycode> biberu, but i need to handle authentication, api etc.. is not a framework good for such things?
[13:07:40] <pycode> Blondie101010, i have a bit of confusion between, queue,channel,task :)
[13:08:38] <Blondie101010> well queue and channel are ways to do the operation with RabbitMQ, but doesn't really change the process
[13:08:46] <biberu> pycode: you don't have to do everything at once, focus on what you need to do now, and what you need to ensure works as early as possible to be able to finish at all

[13:09:44] <biberu> if you can get the communication going the choice of framework is irrelevant
[13:19:50] <pycode> biberu, wait
[13:20:24] <pycode> ok for the communication, you are right...i mean, if i use gearman or rabbit, ok...but then to handle authentication db etc i think a good framework with a good orm does the difference no?

[13:48:41] <AllenJB> paule32: I'm confused as to what you're trying to achieve here. For one thing neither of your examples returns a value from the function. It may help to know what you're doing with the returned value. Why do you want to "return an object without creating it"?

[14:27:09] <Blondie101010> instead of building, it seems like you want to destroy any possible structure
[14:29:06] <AllenJB> I would use factory methods - something like: TColor::createFromName("BlueViolet"); /* with a static array property for colorname => colorcode), as earlier mentioned */ TColor::createFromHex("#123456'); TColor::createFromComponents(int $red, int $green, int $blue, int $alpha);

[19:01:19] <toretto> I'm curious how does the content-type with 'application/octet-stream' is interpreted when there is no content-disposition header specified on the request. I've an endpoint which does returns a content-type as 'application/octet-stream' but doesn't have a content-disposition header on the response but the browser uses that (like a dialog box opens and right name for that file is chosen, but this is all done
[19:01:25] <toretto> without a content-disposition header). How does this work?
[19:02:52] <toretto> Like for example, https://paste.debian.net/plain/1203246
[19:04:06] <toretto> On the response from server there isn't a content-disposition header, but my browser(Google Chrome) choses to save the file and have a valid filename, but I don't know how since there isn't a content-disposition header with a 'filename' attribute.
[19:05:28] <biberu> toretto: guessing that it used the last part of the url as the suggested filename?
[19:06:43] <toretto> biberu: I guess so. Since there isn't a content-disposition header, it goes to the 2nd choice of using the filename from the URI.
[19:07:47] <toretto> biberu: But is that convention on the HTTP specification?(I've never read about that) but I guess browsers do whatever they do if there isn't some condition like there isn't a content-disposition header with a 'filename' attribute to indicate the filename.

[20:50:10] <__adrian> *browsers
[20:52:46] <TML> It should also be noted that this behaviour is not only browser-defined, but also known to be very problematic. Only a brief search is required to turn up a number of bugs about how browsers handle downloads.
