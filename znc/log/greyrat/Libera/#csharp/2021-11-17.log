[01:42:04] <alguien> Why is this GroupBy apparently a problem for user-side evaluation? https://0bin.net/paste/B-cOUovL#EJVqsZye7UhT3ZLAJzYZF6bgk+k3-DdOloqoLjCSvtw
[01:42:09] <alguien> *client-side
[01:42:23] <alguien> ehm *server evaluation
[01:42:36] <Nasp> ToUpper?
[01:42:47] <Nasp> Just a guess
[01:42:56] <Nasp> How are the other properties defined
[01:42:58] <Suchiman> alguien: EF Core?
[01:43:03] <Suchiman> alguien: what happens after the GroupBy?
[01:43:32] <alguien> Nasp, Suchiman yes. ToListAsync, I didn't wnat to have to explain that (not my code)
[01:43:42] <alguien> Nasp, it should work https://www.npgsql.org/efcore/mapping/translations.html#string-functions
[01:43:55] <Nasp> Ok
[01:44:02] <Suchiman> alguien: just do ToListAsync().GroupBy() then
[01:44:15] <Suchiman> alguien: there's no point in "grouping on the server"
[01:44:16] <alguien> Now, "user" does come from outside, but I mean as far as the query is concerned, it's a static value, that much is expected to be evaluated on the "client"
[01:44:29] <Nasp> Isn't it better to group on the server usually
[01:44:34] <alguien> Suchiman, heh, very practical of you
[01:44:43] <Suchiman> Nasp: only if you apply aggregate functions to it
[01:44:52] <Suchiman> if you ToList it, it still needs to retrieve all rows
[01:45:01] <Nasp> Ohh yeah if it only tolists
[01:45:05] <Nasp> I just assumed it did something
[01:45:21] <alguien> but wait, isn't it better that the server groups it?
[01:45:45] <alguien> i reckon that simplifies client's job
[01:46:09] <Suchiman> alguien: no, because in SQL, GroupBy basically works like a Distinct on the predicate and allows aggregate functions to be executed over it on top
[01:46:25] <Suchiman> alguien: but an IGrouping in LINQ contains all the rows
[01:46:32] <Suchiman> alguien: so you need to retrieve all the rows nontheless

[01:46:41] <Suchiman> and there's no wire format for here are all rows from a group
[01:46:57] <Suchiman> since the data is tabular
[01:47:03] <alguien> Suchiman, sure, you retrieve all rows, but if server grouped them, you can just map them
[01:47:31] <alguien> just count and slice, instead of hash-insert perhaps?
[01:47:54] <Suchiman> alguien: i mean, in theory, you could have the server perform the group and return the results ordered with a Grouping column that contains ascending ids like 1, 2, 3 to identify the group the row belongs to
[01:48:20] *** Joins: nicode (~nic@2607:f2c0:959a:4700:7ee0:3899:77f1:eedc)
[01:49:08] <Suchiman> but a) that's not how SQL GOUP BY works, b) there's very little value in doing that because this is a purely CPU bound task that requires reading all rows nontheless and the database server is the hardest to scale component in your tech stack and a single point of failure, you want to reduce the load on it as much as possible and put it into the frontend which can be easily scaled
[01:49:40] <Nasp> When sql is returned it's never smart about the transfer right?
[01:49:50] <alguien> Suchiman, the column(s) grouped on must necessarily be a part of the select, so you always get rows with the thing-grouped-on, doesn't matter if they're in order. What I'm saying is you don't need to insert rows one by one into IGrouping, you just go through them until the thing-grouped-on changes. Then you know to end the slice and just dump the whole slice into an IGrouping. Just hypothesizing
[01:49:55] <Nasp> Rows i mean

[01:52:45] <alguien> Suchiman, did you get what I was fantasizing about?
[01:53:22] <alguien> Suchiman, wait, I am confused, your point a taken
[01:53:36] <alguien> SQL GROUP is an aggregate thing
[01:54:16] <alguien> I see now Suchiman, thanks
[01:54:31] <alguien> Still.. why the problem, so weird...
[01:55:16] <Suchiman> alguien: because of a), EF Core only translate GroupBy()'s that map to SQL's GROUP BY construct
[01:55:33] <Nasp> Btw did you get a client side evaluation warning or error?
[01:55:46] <Suchiman> alguien: which means after a GroupBy, there must be a select that performs aggregates, e.g. GroupBy(x => x.Something).Select(x => x.Count())
[01:55:46] <alguien> Suchiman, oooh
[01:56:50] <alguien> Nasp, that's the thing, I'm porting a 2.1 project to 5.0, so it's warnings right now (I replaced the logger to be able to get a stack trace) but will actually be exceptions if I let them slide
[01:56:57] <Nasp> Aha
[01:57:01] <Nasp> YEah i was going to recommend that
[01:58:42] <alguien> I appreciate the thought :) I got the idea from the Npgsql author (linked this before: https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/14935#issuecomment-568782764)

[11:15:52] <jmer> biberu: all environment specific appsettings.json files use this approach... But it breaks EF migrations bcause it has no clue what connectionstring to use
[11:16:23] <jmer> biberu: so from my, I admit limited knowledge of EF migrations, this would also break during deployment if database changes are needed.

[11:37:09] <Nasp> jmer:  Yes its beter to build it, since it makes it easier to see in the config what host it's connecting to
[11:37:18] <Nasp> And to have more default settings in like a base appsettings
[11:37:48] <jmer> Nasp: Eeeh... isn't it easier just to look in the configuration file for the environment?
[11:37:50] <Nasp> Does EF have suppoet for having it as separeate fields now?
[11:38:02] <Nasp> Connecting strings tends to get insanely long
[11:38:16] <Nasp> So it's nice to just look in the config and see host=blahblahblah
[11:38:26] <Nasp> Also then you can have the config part of the connectionstring in git
[11:38:31] <jmer> but how do you get EF to understand this then?
[11:38:35] <Nasp> And have credentials as secrets mapped in
[11:39:00] <jmer> I doubt there is any secrets in this setup I see passwords in most of the config files
[11:39:53] <Nasp> I have a this https://gist.github.com/toftware/326528f16c3a055674f08d1978dc6480
[11:40:07] <Nasp> Well then you can be the one to improve security
[11:40:25] <Nasp> This way i also enable encryption by default and you have to actively disable it
[11:40:37] <Nasp> Which is a lot easier to read as individual fields than in a long connection string
[11:41:13] <ki9a> but a pain if you have to create individual entries for this in say azure keyvault
[11:41:30] <Nasp> Pain press create?
[11:41:36] <jmer> I mean, half the connection string in this setup is hardcoded
[11:41:49] <Nasp> Also you only need the pw in keyvault, the rest can just be in the config file in git
[11:43:58] <Nasp> Are they hardcoded with some IsProduction checks or how does that work?
[11:44:02] <Nasp> Anyways i would always build it
[11:44:47] <jmer> Nasp: no more like there's a configuration setting called "UseLocalDB" which then switches from "connectionString = $"Server={server}; Database={database}; UID={uid}; PWD={pwd}";" to "connectionString = $"Server={server};Database={database};Trusted_Connection=YES;";"
[11:44:48] <Nasp> I enforce it for all connectionstrings, sqlserver, postgres, rabbitmq, blobstorage...
[11:45:59] <MaNa3k> are there no GUI in azure for managing mssql users\roles
[11:46:22] <jmer> MaNa3k: depending on the database type you can mostly do it from SQL Server Management Studio or Visual Studio
[11:46:38] <MaNa3k> hmm
[11:46:40] <jmer> Nasp: well I can see how it could be a benefit if you build EVERYTHING...
[11:46:43] <MaNa3k> i have admin role
[11:46:54] <jmer> especially in regards to managing secrets i.e. in azure key vault.
[11:47:09] <jmer> but afaik this is an internal hosting setup we could use integrated security everywhere.

[12:00:41] <biberu> Nasp: i think you should be able to use that in GetConnectionString(), should simply be to assign your config properties to the corresponding properties on the builder, avoiding reflection and string concatenation
[12:01:23] <Nasp> Yeah could do that, but doesn't add that much really
[12:02:02] <biberu> won't change the world, but some safety and a few cycles
[12:02:07] <jmer> Nasp: so when you write dotnet ef migrations add (or remove or whatever command) it picks up the connectionstring you built during code?
[12:03:11] <jmer> I want to update the ApplicationDBContextModelSnapshot.cs because it's out of sync with the current DB. I read that you can do that by adding and removing an migration... BUt when I remove the migration I get a database connection exception
[12:03:29] <jmer> And my current theory is that ef doesn't know where to get the connectionstring
[12:03:34] <Nasp> Not sure if it works with dotnet ef apply migration
[12:03:44] <Nasp> We usually apply migrations on startup
[12:04:04] <jmer> Sure... And then the connectionstring is in place, but when developing?

[12:04:23] <jmer> When actually defining the migrations...
[12:04:31] <Nasp> EF doesn't need a connectionstring for creating a migration
[12:04:31] <jmer> or removing the one you made for development purposes.
[12:04:51] <jmer> when removing one it does because it needs to connect to the DB to generate a new ApplicationDbContextModelSnapshot
[12:04:53] <jmer> .cs
[12:05:14] <jmer> If it doesn't require a connection to the DB for that it's rather odd that I am getting such an error. :P
[12:06:10] <Nasp> Not sure about removing
[12:06:35] <Nasp> But it doesn't or atleast didn't use to need one when creating one
[12:06:39] <Nasp> Could have changed in 5.0
[12:06:46] <jmer> I created one without an issue
[12:06:47] <Nasp> I haven't made a migration since we updated
[12:06:50] <jmer> because it's relying on the snapshot
[12:07:02] <jmer> but I want to update the snapshot because there's drift between the snapshot and the actual DB
[12:07:14] <Nasp> Aha
[12:07:56] <Nasp> You should be able to provide the connection strin
[12:08:08] <Nasp> But i have in my DbContextFactory a localhost connectionstring which usually works
[12:09:03] <jmer> For some reason this specific DB, used for development, is hosted on a server, not localhost
[12:09:18] <jmer> allthough I will propose that we have local DBs always because I fucking hate having a shared dev DB
[12:09:39] <Nasp> Ohh

[15:39:56] <interop_madness> I had one of our webservices output 24MB JSON recently
[15:40:14] <interop_madness> app was searching with too broad constraints

[15:41:24] *** Tazmain is now known as Tazy
[15:41:51] <Tazy> So currently System.Text.Json does show faster serialization times vs newtonsoft
[15:42:08] <ki9a> I give up :)
[15:42:33] <Tazy> I think I missed a few things
[15:45:52] <Tazy> ki9a, why do you give up? Is the issue not newtonsoft ?
[15:46:38] <inceptionflywho> interop_madness, that is json response
[15:46:46] <inceptionflywho> not same as API contract in swagger
[15:47:22] <inceptionflywho> if you have a list of objects in your response, you typically have a sample in your swagger to illustrate.
[15:48:06] <inceptionflywho> And pagination is a good way to constraint the size of response for such APIs
[15:49:32] <interop_madness> pagination of results is a really simple concept that in reality might to be hard to impossible to do in a scalable way
[15:49:37] *** Joins: Roughy (~mdaw45ns@user/roughy)
[15:49:49] <interop_madness> if not impossible outright, regardless of scalability
[15:50:31] <ki9a> Tazy: i was asking if you were writing a client or server
[15:50:45] <interop_madness> unless you drop a lot of assumptions, such as "the total number of pages stays the same while paging through the results"
[15:51:05] <ki9a> 5 or 6 times now
[15:51:16] <interop_madness> I would go as far as considering pagination a code smell
[15:51:25] <inceptionflywho> interop_madness, agreed. I didn't say it is easy. It is a pattern to solve this class of problems! It can get complicated indeed depending on your data model and other factors
[15:51:53] <inceptionflywho> Pagination is a strategy. Its implementation is code. Both are different things.
[15:52:55] <interop_madness> full disclosure, I'm salty about pagination due to https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types
[15:53:12] <interop_madness> literally impossible to browse types beyond concat-stream
[15:53:29] <interop_madness> even though, granted, that's not pagination, that's outright bush-league truncation
[15:54:12] <Tazy> ki9a, ah sorry !, this vpn kills all connections, this is client to server, and server to server . Server to server is the 7.7Mb, client to server isn't much smaller
[15:56:19] <Tazy> ki9a, so the slow point right now, is a server to server interaction, and they on the same cluster in k8s

[15:58:52] <ki9a> Tazy: so asp.net core (server itself) has system.text.json  support together with the regular asp.net core swagger
[15:58:55] <ki9a> that solves 1 part
[15:58:59] <ki9a> You then just need the client
[15:59:43] <Tazy> ki9a, well to a point, we use polymorphism, so will see if that is an issue, because we have that between the server and the BFF.
[15:59:58] <Tazy> the server to server side doesn't so there we are fine
[16:00:05] <Tazy> but server to bff :/
[16:01:34] <ki9a> it doesn't seem the nswag codegen does system.text just yet (almost)
[16:01:39] <ki9a> maybe the openapi java thingy does.

[16:15:36] <jmer> ki9a: latest book was a tad too slow for my liking... But It's the only one where I thought too little happened. I still enjoyed it immensely.

[16:18:29] <jmer> I mean... If you compare Rothfus and Sanderson to... i.e. the Drizzt books from R.A. Salvatore it's obvious that Salvatore's stuff is more "junk reading"
[16:18:38] <jmer> where as Sanderson and Rothfuss produce very high quality books
[16:18:39] <ki9a> The Coldfire trilogy tells a story of discovery and battle against evil on a planet where a force of nature exists that is capable of reshaping the world in response to psychic stimulus.
[16:19:23] <inceptionflywho> (┛◉Д◉)┛彡┻━┻
[16:19:25] <ki9a> where the premise is a bit science fiction (the inhabitants arrived from earth in some kind of statis after the ship they were in gave up finding a good planet and settled ont his one)
[16:19:32] <ki9a> but the story is fantasy
[16:19:40] <jmer> I don't mind a mix :P
[16:19:58] <jmer> as long as it's not filled with lame get outta jail free cards like some authors do
[16:20:12] <ki9a> No this completely lacks in get out of jail free cards :)
[16:20:16] <jmer> good
[16:20:36] <jmer> That's what I like about Sanderson and Rothfuss, their magic systems have rules that makes it hard to just... invent one off capabilities
[16:22:47] <jmer> ki9a: I added the Coldfire Trilogy to my to read list...

[19:56:39] <inceptionflywho> That's what I did few years ago when trying to advocate it :) Everyone is familiar with C# and there was no compelling reason to move.
[19:57:06] <MatthiasVance> Typing less code is the best reason :P
[19:57:17] <inceptionflywho> I don't think that is the most compelling reason
[19:57:23] <inceptionflywho> C# devs don't write essays
[19:57:47] <inceptionflywho> but I think it helps you think much clearly which leads to concise code

[19:58:22] <inceptionflywho> I haven't done any C# in last 4 years!

[19:59:14] <inceptionflywho> canton7, this is not the terminal you were expecting
[19:59:29] <canton7> inceptionflywho, yeah, I got that when you guys didn't reply with a valid git status ><
[19:59:58] <shadowchaser> canton7 you would feel better if they did?;)
[20:00:02] <bomb> ben Mono is still big in game industry
[20:00:38] <inceptionflywho> TBH, I have never used this alias
[20:00:39] <ben> ah interesting
[20:00:43] <inceptionflywho> I always used git status
[20:02:15] <canton7> inceptionflywho, it's not built-in, but I type it more than every other *shell* command combined, so...
[20:02:46] <Lukky> I've kept development of dotnet core barely in the corner of my eye, but what I seem to get out of it is that it is still very much fluctuating. Is the current release "stable" enough for business apps? I mean, like 500+ users of a desktop app?
[20:02:53] <inceptionflywho> I have it in my config so I assume it was always there. I have some others of my own but didn't use the one which were there by default
[20:03:03] <canton7> Lukky, it stopped being ".NET Core" 2 versions ago, now
[20:03:14] <inceptionflywho> I have one `pusho` for `push origin`
[20:03:38] <canton7> Lukky, and yeah, MS, StackOverflow, etc, are all on it, and have been for a long time. It's got singificant performance improvements as well
[20:03:39] <Lukky> yeah, I'm just not sure what the proper name is :-)
[20:03:57] <Lukky> Like I said, I'm stuck on 4.7.2
[20:06:21] <Lukky> I think it's now just ".NET"?
[20:06:31] <ben> .net 6 seems to have some good perf improvements as well
[20:06:43] <Suchiman> it does!
[20:06:54] <inceptionflywho> ben, it is also the LTS version so prefer it over any other old version
[20:07:17] <ben> $dayjob is on 4.8 still but yeah
[20:07:27] <ben> i've moved my hobby projects to 6 already
[20:07:38] <ben> anyone doing advent of code this year?
[20:07:43] <johnjay> what is so special about 4.7.2
[20:07:48] <johnjay> i see that mentioned before
[20:08:28] <Lukky> johnjay: oh, it's just that the code I write is against an application's API, and they're still at 4.7.2
[20:08:50] <johnjay> even though .net 6 is out? .net 6 core. i guess it's not core but it really is
[20:09:01] <Lukky> I was hoping they's upgrade with their latest release, but no...
[20:09:15] <Suchiman> ben: the dropping of the core suffix is only a name change thing, it does not change anything of the feature set (so it will still not run unmodified framework apps). mono is still the way to go to run .NET FX apps on non windows platforms and mono also supports "core" or .NET now too so if you're targeting android and such then that's using mono .NET
[20:09:27] <Suchiman> since mono runs on vastly more platforms than .NET so far
[20:10:07] <johnjay> i thought mono was cancelled
[20:10:15] <Suchiman> johnjay: no
[20:10:23] <johnjay> it's like the GNU .net right
[20:10:26] <Lukky> Is there any link at all between .NET and Mono at the development level?
[20:10:31] <jonp> Lukky: yes
[20:10:54] <Suchiman> Lukky: mono resides inside https://github.com/dotnet/runtime and runs in the same CI
[20:10:56] <jonp> MonoVM is A Thing™ in .NET 6, and CoreCLR & MonoVM share BCL assemblies
[20:11:05] <johnjay> did microsoft take over mono?
[20:11:10] <jonp> yes.
[20:11:16] <johnjay> ahhhhh ok. that explains it
[20:11:16] <Suchiman> johnjay: they bought xamarin which had stewardship over mono
[20:11:25] <jonp> *getting* MonoVM is…not necessarily straightforward, unless you're doing mobile.
[20:11:26] <johnjay> so they basically copied java. openjdk
[20:11:33] <Lukky> at least they will be "pushing" in the same direction
[20:11:48] <jonp> not quite sure how this is "copying Java"?
[20:12:07] <johnjay> java had competing open source implementations i believe. like classpath or something
[20:12:07] <bomb> let's say following :P
[20:12:10] <johnjay> but now it's open source
[20:12:27] <jonp> not sure how it's "following", unless open-sourcing something counts as "following"
[20:12:59] <Suchiman> johnjay: oh yeah there used to be microsoft BCL and mono BCL but since microsoft open sourced .NET Core mono has been replacing mono BCL code with microsoft BCL code
[20:12:59] <ben> ahh ok
[20:13:11] <bomb> well C# started its life after Sun's J++ lawsuit, and it's intended to be Windows-only, until Silverlight
[20:13:24] <jonp> "intended"?
[20:13:32] <jonp> we'll just ignore Mono circa 2001?
[20:13:32] <bomb> now Satya has been doing his idea of "developers developers developers"
[20:13:47] <bomb> was Icaza a Microsoft employee back in 2001?
[20:13:49] <jonp> oh, and Rotor
[20:13:53] <jonp> bomb: no
[20:14:02] <jonp> Icaza was not a Microsoft employee until 2016
[20:14:10] <bomb> exactly my point
[20:14:27] <jonp> i think i lost your point?
[20:14:56] <bomb> Microsoft wasn't interested in cross-platform
[20:14:57] <johnjay> i guess brew install doesn't recognize --with-java so I can't install gcj
[20:15:01] <johnjay> rip gcj
[20:15:46] <jonp> bomb: Microsoft circa 2002 wasn't interested in supporting cross-platform *themselves*, but they were interested in supporting a "standardized" potentially "cross-platform" *effort*
[20:15:53] <jonp> see ECMA standardization and the Rotor project
[20:16:03] <jonp> with Rotor running on BSD Unixes
[20:16:14] <jonp> and Rotor *was* from Microsoft.
[20:17:12] <DevJohnC> jonp, the way I've heard Miguel tell things is that MS was actively hostile towards his efforts in the early days of Mono
[20:17:32] <bomb> jonp if we're counting every Labs project, one might argue Microsoft always wanted to paint the entire world with C#
[20:18:49] <jonp> DevJohnC: "hostile", but not so hostile that there were lawsuits to stop it
[20:19:01] <jonp> there are degrees of hostility. :-)
[20:19:28] <DevJohnC> sure, but let's not rewrite history like MS embraced Mono
[20:20:16] <bomb> ^
[20:20:26] <jonp> they arguably did. in 2016. :-)
[20:20:58] <jonp> they then proceeded to reject lots of parts of mono…
[20:21:01] <jonp> like .dll.config
[20:21:19] <johnjay> well yeah. when you take over you're in charge and can do whatever you want

[21:09:39] <johnjay> don't get mad at me pls. i just tell you my lived experience as a coder on a mac.
[21:09:54] <jonp> Visual Studio Code on macOS can also do C#
[21:10:08] <JakeSays> jonp: well, that's debatable.
[21:10:13] <shadowchaser> johnjay there's sharplab
[21:10:20] <jonp> JakeSays: it is?
[21:10:41] <jonp> …other than when it brings my machine to a crawl by launching a dozen `dotnet` commands…
[21:10:42] <JakeSays> yes. the c# support in vscode is just short of total shit
[21:10:58] <jonp> i'm used to "none at all", so VSCode is still an improvement. :-)
[21:11:04] <johnjay> vscode isn't an iDE. so why would it have anything
[21:11:05] <ben> rider is pretty decent

[21:11:28] <johnjay> ok
[21:11:32] <ben> to get resharper too
[21:11:35] <JakeSays> johnjay: by what definition of ide?
[21:11:37] <johnjay> as long as you have the loicense
[21:11:58] <johnjay> JakeSays: not sure. but something that excludes vscode emacs but includes pycharm, jetbrains, and rider
[21:12:30] <JakeSays> johnjay: well, vscode is in fact an ide. for many languages.
[21:12:50] <johnjay> usually i'd expect an IDE to have git management, class browser, debugger, toolbars, refactoring, intellisense
[21:13:15] <bomb> "Visual Studio for Mac" is just Monodevelop lol
[21:13:19] <JakeSays> well, it has all of those except for toolbars
[21:13:19] <johnjay> it's not a rigidly defined concept
[21:13:27] <DevJohnC> I quite like Rider
[21:13:33] <JakeSays> DevJohnC: me too
[21:13:42] <JakeSays> if it had one feature it'd be better than vs

[21:14:37] <tlf> for ever loving christ. I cannot for the life of me assign a default to a dropdownfor
[21:14:41] <johnjay> bomb: is that related to xamarin studio?
[21:14:42] <tlf> I do not understand why
[21:14:48] <JakeSays> shadowchaser: the dropdowns at the top of a code window. the ones that show classes and methods.
[21:14:54] <bomb> johnjay yes
[21:15:04] <johnjay> Another rebranded version of MonoDevelop is Visual Studio for Mac. Visual Studio for Mac employs many of the same tools as its Windows counterpart: for example, the Roslyn .NET Compiler Platform is used for refactoring and IntelliSense.
[21:15:15] <shadowchaser> JakeSays rider doesn't have that? hmm
[21:15:16] <johnjay> so you're speaking literally
[21:15:18] <johnjay> ok
[21:15:23] <JakeSays> shadowchaser: no. drives me nuts.
[21:15:33] <shadowchaser> yeah, it's pretty useful
[21:16:01] <bomb> johnjay another shocker, Rider is written in Java
[21:16:14] <bomb> using Swing lol
[21:16:22] <johnjay> are you saying the tools should be written in the language to prove itself? XD
[21:16:34] <johnjay> aka eating your own dog food
[21:16:47] <bomb> well it can't be written in C# yet
[21:16:54] <JakeSays> bomb: that's only partially true. the ide proper is java, but all of the c# bits are c#
[21:17:06] <JakeSays> it contains resharper
[21:17:27] <johnjay> i'm dizzy now with all this tooling stuff
[21:17:32] <johnjay> i just want to write stuff in unity
[21:17:44] <johnjay> now even visual studio can't be relied on? @_@
[21:17:45] <JakeSays> rider supports unity
[21:17:46] <bomb> JakeSays well if they wrote that in Java as well, that would be humiliating

[21:46:12] <jonp> it is a generic type, yes;
[21:46:32] <wallbroken> i'm creating a class using a datatype at runtime
[21:46:33] <wallbroken> right?
[21:46:47] <wallbroken> it's that the sense of Generics, right?
[21:47:00] <jonp> …maybe?
[21:47:09] <jonp> the "at runtime" aspect complicates matters
[21:47:24] <jonp> generics is largely a *compile* time construct, with some runtime implications

[21:50:09] <johnjay> ironically the article recommends having a year paid up for any service online. true!!
[21:51:05] <wallbroken> jonp: what's the advantage of Generics?
[21:51:22] <jonp> type safety
[21:51:23] <JakeSays> wallbroken: type safety
[21:51:26] <JakeSays> lol
[21:51:32] <jonp> and code reduction
[21:51:39] <wallbroken> type safety?
[21:51:40] <bomb> johnjay maybe because he's also selling subscriptions for his game engine or something lol
[21:51:49] <JakeSays> and performance
[21:52:18] <johnjay> tldr you have no rights on the internet so be careful with your money
[21:52:28] <jonp> wallbroken: short answer, kinda: https://stackoverflow.com/a/953683
[21:55:53] <AbleBacon> C# / WPF / MVVM / XAML / whatever: ok this is kind of out there, but is there any way for an element to sense what colors it is on top of? like, for example, if i have a button with a white outline, can i have it switch that outline to black if it's on top of something that's already white?

[21:59:50] <bomb> Nasp because unvaccinated kids
[22:00:15] <jonp> doh, that's WinForms
[22:00:31] <AbleBacon> oooooh that's close though
[22:00:32] <Nasp> bomb:  Is that a cause?
[22:01:11] <bomb> Nasp that seems to be the reasoning behind upcoming lockdowns
[22:01:23] <Nasp> Strange, because kids werent a problem during last lockdown
[22:01:29] <AbleBacon> but the thing under the element isn't necessarily the parent of the element hmmm
[22:01:54] <AbleBacon> like, i know that WPF / XAML / everything can detect what's in a given position because it does hit testing

[22:08:01] <JakeSays> Nasp: the delta variant is hitting kids harder than last time
[22:08:31] <Nasp> Have tehre really been no new variants for a year?
[22:08:47] <JakeSays> there are many new variants
[22:10:21] <MizMahem> AbleBacon: hmm... sense the the color in what sense? Like what color the element is over in terms of windows composition? That's going to be tough...
[22:10:42] <MizMahem> AbleBacon: if you just mean "what color is my parent" then that's doable I think.

[22:12:59] <bomb> hi
[22:13:13] <MizMahem> basically all WPF objects should have a `VisualParent` element parent you can get. Then you could walk that tree back up to the root until you find a object that has the sort of color property you want to key off of.
[22:13:30] <bomb> Nasp next variant will hit the toddlers, and then the next one will hit unborn babies

[22:31:15] <Lukky> *sigh*... I need a GOOD file sync app on Windows desktop...

[22:37:44] <bomb> haha
[22:37:53] <Nasp> I need a good file sync as well
[22:39:20] <MichaelLong> robocopy?
[22:42:02] <johnjay> ok so i think the 'mono' command runs assemblies in mono develop. but it's 'dotnet' in microsoft land?

[22:42:54] <Suchiman> johnjay: no idea about mono develop, but on the command line, yes
[22:44:01] <johnjay> i still can't figure out how macOS is changing my PATH. but I see it had /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/Commands
[22:44:12] <johnjay> so I put 2 and 2 together and deduced mono is the command

[22:47:21] <bomb> johnjay use Godot
[22:49:03] <johnjay> brew install godot. roger
[22:50:24] <bomb> homebrew is piece of shit, by the way. Mac users deserve a better package manager
[22:50:26] <bomb> or not lol :P
[22:50:53] <johnjay> i already installed mono outside of brew
[22:50:59] <johnjay> slightly curious if this will do anything
[22:51:05] <bomb> remember when the author of homebrew went full drama queen when he was rejected from Google?

[22:52:22] * bomb invites Diablo-D3 to comment on the incident
[22:53:28] <johnjay> bomb: well it did something. it demanded i download an asset
[22:53:42] <johnjay> then that i make a folder for it. so i did. then it opened a big menu for 2D asset editing
[22:53:48] <johnjay> is that expected behavior?
[22:54:00] <johnjay> and yes homebrew isn't the best. but it's all we got
[22:55:39] <bomb> I don't know, Godot doesn't require downloading anything until you deploy to the platforms
[22:56:05] <johnjay> maybe i didn't understand the UI yet
[22:56:14] <johnjay> it seemed like it wanted asset to open then let you search for one
[22:56:31] <johnjay> have you used it before

[23:08:43] <bomb> I have. initially it does ask whether you want to download some assets (templates, example games, extensions etc.)
[23:09:19] <bomb> I never actually did that. I just created an empty project, and started hacking away
[23:09:30] <bomb> built-in code editor is quite okay

[23:27:10] <johnjay> i will try to figure out where the editor is then. thanks!
[23:27:30] <bomb> editor is right inside
[23:27:58] <bomb> it opens when you attach a script to a game object (Node in Godot jargon)
[23:28:06] <johnjay> ah
[23:28:12] <petererer> Hmm, need to add an OAuth2 client, pretty sure there should be something to handle this already, but searching seems to back to Microsoft's Identity Client which seems to be MS-specific.
[23:28:16] <johnjay> yeah unity has a built in editor as well i guess.
[23:28:17] * petererer dumb :(
[23:28:45] <bomb> last I checked the small tutorial in Godot's official docs was excellent
[23:28:55] <johnjay> ah i will def check that out then
[23:29:07] <johnjay> documentation is so bad. it's a bonanza when someone actually remembers it for being good
[23:29:35] <bomb> yeah, kinda shocker for an open source project lol
[23:29:44] <bomb> but this one is well-funded, and they take this kind of stuff seriously
[23:30:01] <bomb> kinda like Blender
[23:32:39] <Nasp> Yay i now live in a free frisk zone
[23:34:22] <bomb> what's that?
