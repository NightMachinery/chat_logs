[01:59:53] <lsloth2> I got myself into a bind because firefox was hanging and i was in a rush, and didn't want to uprgrade or downgrade it, so i used kill and cont on various pids for various firefox windows.  well, that went ok for a while, but then i got myself into a pickle where at this point, firefox appears to be running in the doc, but i can't actually view it. 
[01:59:53] <lsloth2>   i have so many tabs open, some in private windows, that i don't want to lose, that if there is some magic way to bring it to the foreground or figure out what's happening with it, i'd really love

[04:03:27] <Dagmar> ...and everyone who has been getting regular updates already has an updated store of CA certs, so they don't have the problem at all
[04:04:12] <Dagmar> I've been keeping an eye out because even when you're familiar with how it all works, these problems are a pain in the butt to debug

[05:48:44] <wyclif> What's the best way on *nix to run IRC on a spotty connection so you don't get banned from channels because of reconnections? Do I need to install ZNC or use a VPS?
[05:50:14] <tony> znc is probly your best bet wyclif. there are even free services for that
[05:50:15] <wyclif> Reason I ask is cos it's typhoon season here and I got banned from the #irssi channel and a couple of others because my connection dropped and I was afc so I didn't know I was reconnecting many times to the server
[05:50:44] <akoana> zeno1: I'd use functions to add a bit of structure to script, instead of one big sequence of lines...
[05:50:47] <wyclif> tony: Thanks, can you recommend any of those services?
[05:51:20] <akoana> zeno1: also you could collect the answers in separate arrays, and process them later

[07:00:40] <tsapien> I can recommend MX Linux as a nice distro which happens to be systemd free
[07:00:58] <Hash> i'll find something.
[07:01:09] <tsapien> and is debian based
[07:01:22] <[[R]]> systemd is the devil i tell ya
[07:01:27] <Dagmar> I can recommend spending six months running LFS
[07:01:28] <[[R]]> i guess tahts why all sane dists have switched to it
[07:01:30] * [[R]] giggles
[07:02:23] <Hash> No dists. Distros or distributions.
[07:02:33] <Hash> dists is a plural for dist, which is noun An abbreviation of district: as, Dist. Atty., District Attorney.
[07:02:48] <jcbjoe2021> Is there a way to run a dry run command before you execute it? Like find . -type f -inmae *.mp4’
[07:02:48] <Dagmar> I have yet to see it provide a tangible benefit
[07:03:01] <[[R]]> jcbjoe2021: well there are no side effects to find... so...
[07:03:04] <[[R]]> what would the point be
[07:03:20] <devcpu> i love systemd, all in one place for git grep
[07:03:23] <Hash> jcbjoe2021: it's just a find command. What side effects would it have other than clobber your stdout
[07:03:34] <jcbjoe2021> -delete at the end

[09:24:41] <bullgard4> Sauvin, (You may think that my answer is rar-fetched, but that's the way it is.) When upgrading my Debian 10 to Debian 11, SQLite Browser has got new features, among them »Projects«. I am using SQLite Browser every day, and this offers a chance that I can use SQLIte Browser more conveniently and faster. I set up the new feature, it worked, but only for a very short time. Then the SQLIite browser's layout fell bac
[09:24:41] <bullgard4> k to previous times without an advantage and without leaving an error message. A new manpage for this new feature does not exist yet. I browsed the Internet and found a description. To understand that description better, I need to understand "glob".

[10:47:01] <Hash> A umask of 022 allows only you to write data, but anyone can read data.
[10:47:11] <Hash> A umask of 002 is good when you share data with other users in the same group. Members of your group can create and modify data files; those outside your group can read data file, but cannot modify it.
[10:47:39] <brobrock> I'm also interested in ownership
[10:47:48] <Hash> Now you can see why root requires a diff umask by nature.

[13:23:28] <OnkelTem> Hi all. I experience some problems with my laptop with Ubuntu 20.04. When I restart it takes way too long, minutes... I suspect that's because of some silly addition to Ubuntu 20.04 which makes a weird message to appear in the shutdown log: "A stop job is running for Session N of user M (time / time)"
[13:23:33] <OnkelTem> How to disable this crap?

[13:25:12] <RayTracer> the "stop job for session" message is from systemd and pretty generic. If you already suspect a silly addition, maybe try removing it?
[13:25:28] *** Joins: B_fd (~root@39.103.207.190)
[13:25:47] <OnkelTem> I don't know how to do that RayTracer
[13:26:02] <hexnewbie> It's the whole user session, something in it is still running
[13:26:28] <OnkelTem> I'd prefer it to be terminated then, automatically. Just like it worked before for ages
[13:27:12] <hexnewbie> I think SIGTERM may be sent (not sure),as my user processes won't die at SIGTERM these days, none of them
[13:27:21] <RayTracer> I think "reboot" on shell could be faster, with possibly higher risk of data loss
[13:27:42] <hexnewbie> 'reboot' on the shell pretty much guarantees 2-4-6 minute wait here
[13:28:00] <OnkelTem> Another problem is that when my laptop is being charged, then when it reaches 100% of the charge it goes to sleep automatically. The same happens when I just plug the cable or unplug it: it sleeps. And when I restart my laptop it also can go to the sleep mode. Any ideas?

[18:39:08] <OwOandUwU> tsapien then how am I able to create the file on my system without hibernating before?
[18:39:28] <keithweisshar> When I try to boot the Knoppix ISO through the Ventoy menu it completely locks up.
[18:39:29] <xx> keithweisshar: sounds like something for the ventoy github issue list, the dev is very responsive there.
[18:39:31] <justsomeguy> OwOandUwU: So, what are you trying to do, overall? What made you ask about how to create a resume file in the first place?
[18:40:14] <OwOandUwU> got `The initramfs will attempt to resume from dev/sda4 (the swap partition on my system`
[18:40:35] <tsapien> OwOandUwU: you don't want to do that. That file is created by the OS to tell the computer at boot that it's supposed to resume from hibernate instead of cold boot. If you manually create the file you're telling the computer to always resume even if it was powered off and not hibernated
[18:40:48] <OwOandUwU> hmm, weird
[18:40:52] <justsomeguy> Was that an error message that you got when you were trying to boot up, OwOandUwU ?

[19:42:49] <kuhilas> howdy. I have 256G disk. At the begin of disk is 260M efi partition and 16M microsoft partition, then 100G windows ntfs partition. Then is 64G unallocated. After that is 64G linux / partition where I'm typing this. After that is 4G swap, after that some 1G or smaller partitions related to windows or small unallocated. I want to use that 64G unallocated for linux. My root partition is 60/64G full so I would want to increase root partition size, or
[19:42:49] <kuhilas> maybe move my home directory to that other partition if that is smarter solution, since my home dir takes over 40G

BUT. after reboot colors go back tp default. One more. If I use "device-get-default-profile" I will see that my profile is stay default, but I must use "device-make-profile-default" again to

[20:22:59] <rascul> frozen_ i don't know much about it but maybe you need to be running the colord service
[20:23:15] <keir> frozen_: as far as i'm concerned, color profiles are only for the session. you need to add it xprofile or something
[20:23:37] <rascul> also you might need something in the x startup stuff

[23:18:12] <rustytaco> my laptop's color scheme is so dark it mocks goth kids for not wearing black enough clothes :P
[23:18:12] <joo> Not sure how many people are in the CPU game anymore? I feel like it has been forever since cpu speed has been a bottlekneck, since i7 came out
[23:18:30] <paulcarroty> not like 30-40% difference like 12th gen
[23:18:46] <KillerWasp> joo# cpu like what?
[23:18:46] <rustytaco> i dont play vidja games, so i dont even really pay attention. if it can recompile world on my project in something under a few days, im OK with it
[23:18:51] <joo> will 12th gen be 30-40% better ?

[23:19:17] <hexnewbie> rustytaco: Appreciate Doom 3 by making it black foreground on black background
[23:19:18] <paulcarroty> yep
[23:19:21] <Guest21> nearly there
[23:19:29] <joo> Oh I didnt know games could utilize that ! I thought that was all on the GPU these days
[23:19:50] <rustytaco> With 12 cores @ 3.4ghz it takes about 3 days to build everything, which really isn't bad if you consider the fact the compiler has to train on ~14tb and growing dataset.. :O
[23:20:02] <KillerWasp> joo# the GPU is only for shaders.
[23:20:18] <joo> wow that is a long build time
[23:20:18] <paulcarroty> all depends from your projects
[23:20:25] <KillerWasp> also you can't use GPU for any other thing, it's very slow and ugly.
