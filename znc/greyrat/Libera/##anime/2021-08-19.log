[01:23:12] <SpiritOfSummer> it's not the anime that I'm craziest about but I really like Shoto Todoroki

[01:23:30] <Berlin36> he's good
[01:23:34] <Berlin36> but
[01:23:37] <Berlin36> meh
[01:23:51] <SpiritOfSummer> there's quite a bit in the show that I don't care about
[01:24:20] <SpiritOfSummer> I think the story with midoriya and all might is good, shoto is my relatable character, and the villains are alright
[01:24:31] <Berlin36> have you watched one punch man?

[01:29:37] <SpiritOfSummer> I have downloaded the last 3 seasons though
[01:29:37] <snake> yeah i dont get what is good about dbz, its basically the same formula over and over again
[01:29:48] <SpiritOfSummer> the Tien arc, the piccolo arc and the piccolo jr arc, I will watch them one day

[01:30:37] <Berlin36> mick gordon is awesome
[01:30:43] <SpiritOfSummer> but there's new manga arcs for dragon ball super
[01:30:55] <SpiritOfSummer> I'm just hoping those are good and fucking huge things have happened with vegeta lately
[01:30:57] <SpiritOfSummer> so that's good
[01:31:23] <snake> are the 3 major scale plots of dbz the saiyan arc, freeza, and then cell?
[01:31:23] <SpiritOfSummer> Berlin36: is season 2 of one punch man good
[01:31:30] <snake> also what about majinn buu?
[01:31:31] <Berlin36> i don't remember anything
[01:31:38] <Berlin36> but i remember that i loved the series
[01:31:46] <Berlin36> the last season was good
[01:31:47] <snake> it just seems like the enemy is always stronger than ever... then goku trains, and then he beats them
[01:31:56] <Berlin36> hahahaha ^ every anime
[01:31:59] <SpiritOfSummer> snake: not everyone does, but I consider the vegeta arc to the the first sub arc ro the frieza era. so to me, there's the freiza arc, the cell arc, and the buu arc
[01:32:04] <SpiritOfSummer> each of them consist of 3 seasons
[01:32:07] <snake> idk man, dragon ball had a more interesting plot than that

[04:16:08] <ButterNoodle> can u say bikini trout
[04:17:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The bug problem is fundamental to the monolithic kernel model.
[04:17:43] <ButterNoodle> ?
[04:17:46] <ButterNoodle> dont do that
[04:17:49] <ButterNoodle> build modules
[04:18:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Modules are far from enough.
[04:18:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They're a patch to make out-of-tree maintenance of kernel code feasible. The kernel is still fundamentally a monolithic kernel.
[04:18:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There is no separation of parts in kernel code once it's loaded, for the most part. Everything has access to everything else.
[04:19:11] <ButterNoodle> oiv
[04:19:13] <ButterNoodle> oic
[04:19:21] <ButterNoodle> so post load function
[04:19:41] <ButterNoodle> ZOS then
[04:20:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I was thinking more of security microkernels like seL4 but yes.
[04:20:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Small & secure Hypervisors that separate sensitive components are a good second.
[04:22:00] <ButterNoodle> tru, sounds good but idk shit once we get down in the weeds that far
[04:23:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> DKMS & KMOD. KMODs are all modules. DKMS is the subset that's out-of-tree.
[04:23:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (Just correcting inaccuracy in my earlier statement)
[04:23:37] <ButterNoodle> systems where physical components run their own microkernels and interact with different parts of the isolated system sound pretty fault tolerant
[04:24:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Basically, on microkernels drivers are userspace and don't run as privileged. If they crash they don't get to overwrite other stuff, and they usually can only reference other things which they have been explicitly given handles to.
[04:24:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Usually via some form of capability-based security
[04:25:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So some sort of message passing is inherent to the system function.
[04:25:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Qubes emulates that over a hypervisor. seL4 implements it fully conventionally as it is a microkernel.

[06:16:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Right. As I thought. That tragedy of commons thing is drawing a comparison that really doesn't work.
[06:17:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The use of outdated kernel versions is purely a decision of the distro for its defaults, and most of them allow their users to use the more recent ones just fine.
[06:17:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The duplication of effort exists literally for no reason than to support specific support agreements and businesses.
[06:18:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Or "stability" but really... I don't remember the last time either Arch or Debian had issues with the kernel on my machines.
[06:20:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The issue with session persistence and permanence is more highlighting design issues in a lot of software, and ultimately a limitation of non-image-based systems.
[06:21:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Mind, not only image-based has persistent (virtual) memory as a model, it's just more common witht hose.
[06:21:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> *those
[06:22:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Properly designed software allows you to do things like what Emacs does when you run these: (desktop-save) (desktop-read) ;; One saves your session, the other reloads the state to what it was prior to shutting down.
[06:23:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The need to reboot on kernel updates is also due to the software design chosen. If it were object-based, a metaobject protocol could be implemented to update those objects in-place.
[06:24:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (Although some distros still support the kernel's live-patching features)

[08:06:53] <jessedesu_onaph> Should I do full disk encryption

[08:07:40] <ButterNoodle> *the answer is yes
[08:07:41] <jessedesu_onaph> Nope
[08:07:54] <ButterNoodle> because you should use FDE, and learn how to recover it

[09:57:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (Rounding up and execution was a thing for a while)

[09:58:56] <amigojapan> No Omega037 I am not Japanese
[09:58:59] <Omega037> Because I lived there for two years and wasn't treated like I was Japanese even once
[09:59:06] <isekaijin> Aurora_v_kosmose: What amazes me about Asia is how tiny groups of people from tiny countries (well, Afghanistan is not ‚Äútiny‚Äù, just ‚Äúsmall‚Äù, but think about the Russian republics from the Caucasus) are willing to fight to the death for their country and their identity.
[09:59:27] <amigojapan> Why would you expect to be treated as Japanese Omega037 
[09:59:46] <Omega037> I wouldn't because they are racist
[09:59:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> isekaijin: It's honestly kind of strange.
[10:00:15] <Omega037> Again, it isn't like US racism with it being tied to class and crime
[10:00:27] <Nanobot> The air quality here is purple again. :( We had a good few days of only red.
[10:00:31] <Omega037> It is more like the kind of racism where "oh you are Black, you must love fried chicken"
[10:00:34] <isekaijin> Aurora_v_kosmose: It is somehow worthy of respect, even if the consequences are ultimately destructive.
[10:00:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> isekaijin: It requires a very strange kind of conviction to be willing to stake your life on waging religious war. That or so little non-shitty alternatives that you might live better off if you manage your conquest (usual warlord/gang reason).
[10:00:54] <Omega037> But it is also possibly a difference of where you live, amigojapan
[10:01:01] <Omega037> I lived in a very rural area of Japan
[10:01:10] *** Joins: Mr_Miser1 (~weechat@27.34.108.123)
[10:01:33] <isekaijin> Aurora_v_kosmose: Yes.
[10:01:54] <amigojapan> Omega037: I have also gone to other places like kyuushuu and been treated as a king
[10:01:56] <Nanobot> I'm suspicious of anyone who doesn't like fried chicken. Even if you don't eat fried chicken, you can't deny that it's super tasty.
[10:02:01] <Omega037> OK
[10:02:07] <Omega037> I also talked to a lot of other JETs
[10:02:17] <Omega037> Including ones of Indian or Asian descent
[10:02:28] <Omega037> They were definately treated differently, and not for the better
[10:02:58] <Omega037> I also knew two black JETs, they got treated like even more of an oddity, though not particularly badly
[10:03:17] <amigojapan> Omega037: I hope some day you repent from being so racist
[10:03:29] <Omega037> Not to mention the fact that the Japanese seem to think even blood type tells a lot about a person
[10:04:36] <Omega037> Anyways, I don't think it matters too much, beyond the fact that Japan itself is an intentional ethnostate
[10:04:44] <Omega037> Which sorta makes it racist by definition
[10:04:51] <Omega037> It is a country for a specific race
[10:05:05] <isekaijin> Aurora_v_kosmose: The reason why I am saying this is that there is a relatively peaceful alternative: assimilation. Like, just accepting that their culture has lost, and each one of them is personally better off if they just integrate into the culture that has won.
[10:05:17] <Omega037> People don't like change
[10:05:30] <Omega037> Which is why it often requires older generations to die off
[10:05:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> isekaijin: The thing is that I'm really not sure that it's just defense of culture, and not a lot of the second reason. Afghanistan is poor.

[10:06:44] <Omega037> Hmm, I wonder if I will ever visit Japan again
[10:07:05] <Omega037> I planned to a year or two after I came back, but life got in the way, then I had kids
[10:07:14] <Omega037> Now I am like 13 years out
[10:07:21] <amigojapan> Omega037: how many years ago did you come to Japan?
[10:07:24] <Omega037> Maybe 7 years from now
[10:07:27] <Omega037> I came in 06
[10:07:30] <Omega037> left in 08
[10:07:38] <Omega037> So maybe I visit in 2028?
[10:07:48] <Omega037> My oldest would be 14, youngest would be 10
[10:08:12] <Omega037> I still have some gaijin friends over there that I could connect with
[10:08:29] <Omega037> And a contact at a consulate here
[10:09:03] <isekaijin> Aurora_v_kosmose: Throwing away roughly half of their available human talent (by not allowing women to work) is certainly not the way to lift themselves from poverty.
[10:09:19] <amigojapan> Omega037: tomako says "I have also heard people speak badly about Chinese people, but I have many Chinese friends so it pissed me off"
[10:09:44] <Omega037> So two of the JETs who came with me (and lived in bordering towns) stayed and opened a school

[10:10:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> isekaijin: Yeah. That's also one of the very weird things about their religion and philosophy. We have machines now. The difference in physical strength between men and women matters very little.
[10:10:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Anyone able to be educated can work.
[10:11:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> In theory anyway.
[10:11:07] <Omega037> I'll be honest, I had planned to stay 5+ years originally, but life went the way it did
[10:11:25] <isekaijin> Exactly. What if a family has a son and a daughter, and the daughter happens to be the more intelligent or at least academically gifted one? If they have only enough money to send one of them to school, then it would be rational to send the daughter to school.
[10:12:08] <Omega037> I would probably have tried to get a MEXT Scholarship for grad school in Japan
[10:12:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> isekaijin: Agreed
[10:13:01] <Omega037> It was actually a nice program and I would have been a good candidate, but I heard grad school and STEM jobs in Japan are rough

[16:23:44] <TsundereNoises> it's more me thinking, well, if my pinkie toe heals wrong, who cares

[16:25:47] <analoq> yeah one would want to go to the dr before it's too late, but then it's not worse enough to justify the cost yet
[16:26:01] <TsundereNoises> like, pulling a number out of my ass here, but 90% I go in, they want to do an x-ray, it turns out it's just some small fracture and they can't do anything about it, tape the toe to the next toe and tell me not to run or anything

[16:26:23] <Urchin[emacs]> TsundereNoises: the one time I had issues that required X-ray, I got it in the midle of the night and didn't have to pay for anything (though I did have to find a hospital with a radiologist on duty)

[17:05:27] <name100> hehe
[17:05:41] <name100> i drink before i go to dentist
[17:06:07] <loveorcognac> brush your teeth afterwards
[17:06:16] <name100> yes
[17:06:44] <loveorcognac> unless your dentist enjoys beer breath
[17:07:18] <loveorcognac> which I think is not very likely

[17:09:04] <name100> probably not
[17:09:49] <TsundereNoises> I see we have another sentionics
[17:12:11] <Cryowolf> damn I have to find some place that sells latexfoam that I can cut into custom shape of width, length and thickness. To replace my couch seats cause theyre fecked
[17:16:03] <TsundereNoises> what did you do to your couch that you have to completely replace the inside of the cushions?

[17:17:18] <name100> biiru tanoshinderu
[17:17:38] <Cryowolf> the seats have been like pressed together
[17:17:58] <Cryowolf> so Im looking for foam stuff to make custom cut outs, to sew together, glue together and replace it with
[17:18:28] <TsundereNoises> Cryowolf: it seems like there must be an easier solution but I don't know what it is
[17:18:35] <Cryowolf> there isn't
[17:19:19] <Cryowolf> if the foam has basically become pressed together and misshapen etc
[17:19:24] <Cryowolf> it's not comfortable, it looks horrible
[17:19:32] <TsundereNoises> well my grandmother had a shitty old couch where she folded up some blankets and put them under the cushions for additional cushoning, for example
[17:19:39] <Cryowolf> and theres only two solutions. New foam to make new seats or a new couch
[17:19:45] <Cryowolf> that's not gonna work
[17:19:53] <Cryowolf> or rather that doesnt work
[17:20:06] <TsundereNoises> I mean it worked in that case but maybe not for your cushions
[17:20:10] <TsundereNoises> I was just throwing out an idea
[17:20:11] <Cryowolf> Im not looking for random solutions here, I've tried everything there is to do
[17:20:27] <Cryowolf> Im looking for a place to buy foam latex or cold foam
[17:20:38] <Cryowolf> in Europe, preferably Sweden
[17:20:56] <Cryowolf> because there's no solution to this problem other than this
[17:24:12] <Cryowolf> ah theres a place that sells cold foam that can be cut to custom sizes. The thickest is 10cms though so I just need to buy two to sew together and glue together
[17:24:54] <Cryowolf> though if I can find latexfoam that's cheaper

[17:57:15] <snake> ikea is falling from grace in many areas, but couches especially are not very good from there
[17:57:18] <Cryowolf> well if it doesnt exist in Sweden, it's sort of out of the question
[17:57:38] <snake> you can order online and they ship it to you
[17:57:58] <Cryowolf> yes and Im sure it wont cost a fortune to ship overseas either

[17:58:21] <Cryowolf> internationally?
[17:58:24] <snake> yes..
[17:58:39] <Cryowolf> that doesnt make much sense considering how much it costs

[17:58:53] <snake> sheesh
[17:59:07] <Cryowolf> no location is important cause Sweden has toll, customs, taxes etc
[17:59:13] <snake> oic
[17:59:17] <Cryowolf> and it costs A LOT from some locations
[17:59:23] <snake> its from CHYNA

[18:03:00] <Cryowolf> Sadale, not sure that works either...they've got some pretty weird fees set up
[18:03:03] <snake> yes we have sadale, an insider who can send us gifts from the land of chins
[18:03:03] <Sadale> And I'd just fill in a low value in the custom declaration form.
[18:03:40] <Cryowolf> Sadale, the fee doesnt caare about the value
[18:03:42] <Cryowolf> thats the thing
[18:03:48] <Cryowolf> they just slap it on
[18:03:48] <Sadale> or do it like this. I'd purchase something, disassemble that and send it to you as "kit". Since it's unfinished product, it'd have no value.
[18:04:05] <snake> oh no-value VAT and fees damn

[18:16:07] <ButterNoodle> unless ur so is the gotta fixit and nurture it kinda person
[18:16:30] <Cryowolf> the one Im buying has comfort zones which basically means different thickness and consistency on the fabric in different areas in order to provide the body with better stabilization of the hips and jjoints and that's not a gimmick
[18:16:31] <snake> ButterNoodle, you seem like a bit of an ass sometimes ngl
[18:16:39] <snake> maybe that is why your family sucks? because you're an ass

[18:17:13] <Cryowolf> then going to Ikea to buy a pillow with cooling gel too. So I wont ever have to flip the pillow

[18:19:24] <Cryowolf> purple mattress seems overly convoluted in their construction
[18:19:26] <ButterNoodle> I honestly dont know where I'd want to live.. the world is a strange place rn
[18:19:45] <Cryowolf> and I duinno if that's a gimmick or not either
[18:19:46] <snake> Cryowolf, if you can critique it and maybe publish that somewhere, it'd be interesting
[18:20:06] <snake> i have no idea im just like wow so soft
[18:20:09] <Cryowolf> the important thing though is if it gives you better sleep, stability and comfort

[18:20:40] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Scarlet Nexus | Episode: 3
[18:20:41] <Cryowolf> usually soft doesnt mean good though, you need something where your whole body can stabilize and not sink where its heavy for temporary soft comfort
[18:20:45] <Cryowolf> cause it is very temporary
[18:20:51] <ButterNoodle> those foam tops seem to break down quickly.. and get an ass grove wore in them in a few years
[18:20:57] <Cryowolf> the one Im buying is medium firm
[18:21:25] <ButterNoodle> unless we are buying cheaper mattresses that only stay comfortable for a short time..
[18:21:29] <ButterNoodle> then replace
[18:21:31] <Cryowolf> the top contains cooling gel and air memory (memory foam with air holes and pockets to help shape it after your bopdy) and under that theres cold foam
[18:21:36] <snake> ButterNoodle, the purple has not worn down, i can say that much at least
[18:21:45] <Cryowolf> the mattress Im buying comes with 25yr warranty
[18:21:47] <ButterNoodle> the last mattress I bought was 1400$
[18:22:05] <ButterNoodle> and it started pinching a nerve in my back after about 6 months
[18:22:13] <snake> Cryowolf, i like how yours makes the same sales pitch as the purple but it costs a more reasonable price
[18:22:14] <Cryowolf> mines just 350 (well down from 700) so it's a budget one
[18:22:19] <snake> ButterNoodle, oof
[18:22:33] <ButterNoodle> could have also been a combination of the mattress settling in and all the cats laying on me..
[18:22:39] <Cryowolf> snake, I like reasonable prices cause I'm poor :P
[18:22:45] <snake> same ;-;
[18:22:53] <Cryowolf> but replacing a 30+ year old bed is a priority
