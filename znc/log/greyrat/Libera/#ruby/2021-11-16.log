[03:13:30] <Al2O3> so, I am reading and studying Ruby right now, reading many books, many online tutorials and of course good advice from them all (and some opinions as well, or both).  Here is one I would like to follow, and ask this community for examples to DL and look/assess.
[03:13:35] <Al2O3> "Hereâ€™s something to do the next time you have a rainy afternoon to kill: Download
[03:13:35] <Al2O3> two or three significant Ruby programs, maybe utilities that you use every day or
[03:13:35] <Al2O3> applications you have heard of or perhaps projects whose names you just happen to

[03:14:12] <Al2O3> since I don't like per se, I'm learning (again) Ruby after 17 years of absence, what would be two good programs or utilities to DL and look at.
[03:15:06] <Al2O3> they should likely be small, compact, good utilities that one uses every day and of course well written, and of course available to view source.
[03:21:49] <weaksauce> Al2O3 how familiar are you with ruby?
[03:23:20] <weaksauce> rails actually has an interesting guide on the initialization of it if you are somewhat familiar with that 
[03:23:29] <weaksauce> but it's probably out of your depth right now
[03:23:51] <weaksauce> maybe rake

[04:31:33] <weaksauce> those are c right?

[04:31:58] <havenwood> weaksauce: I thought it was to implement things that weren't necessarily in Ruby.
[04:32:06] <havenwood> weaksauce: git subcommands are in a variety of langs
[04:32:23] <havenwood> they ship bash, C, C++?, perl? I can't remember them all.
[04:32:46] <weaksauce> oh i didn't get that they wanted to implement it... it just sounded like they wanted to read some good code
[04:32:51] <havenwood> You can write them in Ruby.
[04:33:00] <havenwood> weaksauce: Maybe I'm the one that got it wrong. Rereading.
[04:33:20] <havenwood> weaksauce: Yup, you're right. I'm wrong.

[05:24:22] <weaksauce> Al2O3_ this guide is interesting... https://guides.rubyonrails.org/initialization.html
[05:24:32] <weaksauce> worth downloading the source to follow along too
[05:25:55] <Al2O3> interested in C tools that can be implemented in ruby, as exercises.

[05:26:42] <Al2O3> it was just coming around in the 2006'ish timeframe as I recall with basecamp.

[19:50:10] <depesz> hi. I have a problem with regexp and gsub with block: https://gist.github.com/depesz/39096aef34b88e03bc83c829aed1f742
[19:50:45] <depesz> generally when I do: `string.gsub(regexp) do |x|` - x is *whole match*, and I'd like to get either match object, or $2 from the match
[19:50:48] <depesz> is it possible?
[19:54:58] <nakilon> >In the block form, the current match string is passed in as a parameter, and variables such as $1, $2, $`, $&, and $' will be set appropriately. (See regexp.rdoc for details.) The value returned by the block will be substituted for the match on each call.
[19:55:18] <nakilon> you have to use $1 instead of x
[19:55:33] <nakilon> whatever is the number of the group you want
[19:56:14] <ox1eef> nakilon: i never heard of piton
[19:57:19] <depesz> nakilon: aaah. thanks a lot.
[19:57:51] <nakilon> ox1eef your knowledge is outdated https://imgur.com/a/C80N5su

[20:00:40] <nakilon> if you want to have any job you better learn these three languages ..P
[20:02:49] <ox1eef> yeah python is what everyone seems to use on tech twitter. the ruby job market still seems healthy, though.

[23:09:01] <drocsid> Hi rubyists. Everytime I launch a terminal in MacOS I get a message Required jruby-9.1.12.0 is not installed. To install do rvm install "jruby-9.1.12.0" which happens to fail. But can I see why or where this particular jruby is requested or requried?

[23:11:38] <weaksauce> drocsid tough to say... does it happen if you force an empty bash/zsh profile
[23:12:21] <adam12> CalimeroTeknik: Yes, sounds right.
[23:12:41] <weaksauce> you could try bash -x or zsh -x to get a full debugging output
[23:12:54] <weaksauce> it's ... a lot of information though

[23:15:57] <drocsid> weaksauce, good ideas. I cleared out relevant portions of zshrc and it looks like it was caused by a path setting.
[23:17:44] <drocsid> specfically I think it was caused by the path setting to the logstash binary paths for jruby. I'm suprised the latest logstash uses that old version. I have been trying to execute tests for logstash using jruby, and using a little inline ruby in a logstash config.
[23:18:18] <weaksauce> nice

[23:20:11] <CalimeroTeknik> adam12, thanks!
[23:20:13] <drocsid> It's still quite odd however. When I go to the logstash inary path included with logstash it reports jruby 9.29.18.0 (2.5.8) when I jruby --version
[23:21:11] <drocsid> So troubling it requests that I install that ancient version. I'm goiing to re-add the path elements and see if that's still the case.
