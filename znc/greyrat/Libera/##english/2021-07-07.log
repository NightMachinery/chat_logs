[00:29:45] <LiberationArmy> What is the word if you can't stop thinking about something?
[00:30:23] <LiberationArmy> Like 10 or so white chicks on the subway trying to bully you because you're the most beautiful boy they've ever seen.
[00:30:35] <LiberationArmy> And then in the end, you man-handled them like no-one else.
[00:30:42] <LiberationArmy> And, it's all live on TikTok?
[00:31:32] <LiberationArmy> By bully I mean testing to see if you can be the father of their kids.
[00:33:04] <LiberationArmy> The fatter the white chick's behinds, the more aggressive they are. I learned that first hand Friday.
[00:33:50] <LiberationArmy> It was unfair though, because they were in their early 20s, and I'm in my late 30s. Y'all should have seen the fear in their eyes after I schooled them in front of the whole subway.

[00:50:18] <toretto> What is the exact technical name of this leadership: A leader, let's call him A, is only in power because his dad was a leader himself, let's call him B, but B is leader in the first place because B's dad was in power. What is the technical name of this type of leadership?
[00:50:24] <toretto> Like, generation after generation.
[00:50:35] <toretto> I'm not sure about the technical name of this.
[01:00:10] <diskin> toretto, dynasty?

[01:00:39] <r3> er, nepotism?
[01:01:06] <darsie> Are Mars and asteroid 588 Achilles male or neutral?
[01:01:13] <toretto> Not really a dynasty. It's like political party leader.
[01:01:33] <r3> toretto: Hereditary monarchy
[01:01:47] <toretto> I think that's what I'm looking for, r3
[01:02:15] <r3> except, yeah, monarchy however means kings & queens
[01:02:39] <r3> "A series of rulers from the same family would constitute a dynasty. "
[01:02:44] <r3> so diskin was right too
[01:02:56] <toretto> But in this case, not a king/queens. It's *specifically* a "political party"
[01:03:09] <toretto> That I'm refering to.
[01:03:19] <r3> toretto: have a look through [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_succession ]
[01:05:29] <r3> I would think that it would still be a "Hereditary _____" something
[01:07:43] <toretto> Yeah.
[01:11:38] <r3> generally, could be Hereditary succession - might be good enough

[22:16:25] <easyme> How to prepare?
[22:17:21] <zubeida> easyme: you said you're not taking the exam.
[22:17:36] <easyme> I can take that exam in future.
[22:19:13] <kompowiec> all the tutors I have met say that I only have problems with tenses and prepositions. A2 level
[22:22:19] <zubeida> kompowiec: do you have a question?
[22:22:57] <kompowiec> tbh, not here, because I won't learn the pronunciation here :P

[22:25:57] <easyme> kompowiec: For study
[22:26:48] <kompowiec> i gotcha.
[22:28:21] <easyme> Why is it difficult to score 150 in verbal?
[22:28:39] <kompowiec> because english have so many tenses which almost nobody use
[22:28:49] <zubeida> kompowiec: what?
[22:28:50] <pussipupu> .wik GRE
[22:29:15] <pussipupu> English has two tenses, past and nonpast
[22:29:31] <pussipupu> Also two aspects and a bunch of moods
[22:29:37] <zubeida> kompowiec: english has one of the more simple tense structures.
[22:29:38] <easyme> Present,past,future tenses
[22:29:40] <pussipupu> What's a GRE?
[22:29:44] <zubeida> kompowiec: don't go with the grammar too much.
[22:29:46] <kompowiec> aa right, i use wrong word sry
[22:29:54] <zubeida> kompowiec: if you want to learn the language.
[22:29:58] <zubeida> pussipupu: it's an exam.
[22:30:06] <zubeida> pussipupu: for potential graduate students.
[22:30:49] <kompowiec> zubeida: this is what I meant to convey easyme too, grammar in English is not the most important thing.
