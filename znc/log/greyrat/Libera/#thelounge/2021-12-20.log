[23:22:43] <xnaas> slothpaw: that seems likely. Hopefully your provider is responsive. :P — I'd ask if it's possible for you to do any config in the future and the path the file is at. Most likely not, but never hurts to ask.

[23:25:38] <MiStEriO> I have installed the client on my server and i would like to know if there are a way to translate it to spanish
[23:25:48] <slothpaw> xnaas good idea, i already contacted them
[23:25:48] <slothpaw> big thx for the help 
[23:25:48] <slothpaw> main reason i choose the service was that they were packaging TL
[23:25:50] <MiStEriO> Im a spanish native speaker
[23:26:01] <bookworm> the answer to that is no
[23:26:26] <MiStEriO> And there are not some folderwith the html files?
[23:27:08] <MiStEriO> I mean, wherre are the files of the client itself, and not talking about /etc/thelounge
[23:27:12] *** Joins: Cammy_ (~androirc@185.73.155.207)
[23:27:48] <bookworm> you can patch the source, that's possible. Files are in the src + client directories in the source repo

[23:29:42] <MiStEriO> thelounge: /usr/bin/thelounge /etc/thelounge
[23:29:43] <bookworm> we use vue, if you try to patch an already built version of thelounge (meaning the one you are actually running) you're gonna have a bad time
[23:29:54] <MiStEriO> Ahhh
[23:30:01] <MiStEriO> I understand now
[23:30:19] <MiStEriO> So you say i have to make the modifications before i compile?
[23:30:26] <bookworm> yes

[23:32:37] <MiStEriO> Ahmmm, but i have installed trough a .deb file
[23:32:54] <MiStEriO> Is there another way to install?
[23:33:46] <bookworm> yes, but I'd avoid that. You can create a package from your patched source with https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge-deb
[23:33:49] *** Joins: steam (~steam@user/steam)
[23:34:20] <bookworm> well, with some modifications at least
[23:34:39] <MiStEriO> Ok ok, i checking that on the oficial website
[23:34:54] <MiStEriO> Running from source, im right?
[23:36:15] <bookworm> yes and no, you won't have the corresponding systemd units and need to copy them manually to the proper directories. Also you need to make sure to install it somewhere sane with the proper permissions and create and manage a system user appropriately
[23:36:18] <bookworm> but sure, that's an option
[23:36:21] <bookworm> just more work
[23:37:08] <MiStEriO> And wich option do you recommend to make custom modificatios taking in count im not an super advanced Linux user?
[23:38:15] <bookworm> to be honest? None. Become a more advanced Linux user first 😉
[23:38:24] <MiStEriO> I would like to be able to translate it and make some changes in the appereance and behabior of the client itself
[23:38:32] <bookworm> as in read up on it and learn by doing I guess
