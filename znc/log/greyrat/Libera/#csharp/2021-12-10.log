[00:10:11] <MichaelLong> hm those english muffins aren't that bad
[00:10:26] <sysRPL> humans beings are evolved to eat eggs
[00:10:45] <sysRPL> we're not evolved to eat processes sugars
[00:11:40] <MichaelLong> I avoid sugar at all costs, but it is almost unavoidable
[00:11:54] <bomb> industrial eggs don't have chickens
[00:12:02] <sysRPL> we're also evolved to eat cooked foods. cooking with fire caused out ancestors to gain 20-30 more nutrition
[00:12:06] <bomb> but I avoid id anyway
[00:12:11] <MichaelLong> vegan eggs are better
[00:12:15] <sysRPL> cookin and is what gave us big brains quite leterally
[00:12:27] <bomb> and if were evolved to eat eggs, why do we cook it?
[00:12:37] <sysRPL> * cooking is what gave us big brains quite literally
[00:13:00] <sysRPL> cooking increases the nutrient in our food
[00:13:22] <sysRPL> and cooked foods allowed our brains to grow
[00:13:27] <bomb> sounds like correlation rather than causation
[00:13:58] <bomb> we discovered the wheel along the way. so wheel made our brains grow
[00:14:23] <sysRPL> no, it's science. once we gained 20-30% nutrients our brains has the extra fuel required to grow larger
[00:15:06] <bomb> then processed sugar will make us even smarter, because brain consumes glucose like motherfucker
[00:15:07] <sysRPL> your brain is mostly fat, and those extra nutrients were required to make you fatty brain
[00:15:23] <sysRPL> glucose is not equal to fat

[00:16:25] <bomb> not you sysRPL, another sysRPL in a few millennia

[00:18:20] <sysRPL> wikipedia -> Overview. Humans (species in the genus Homo) are the only animals that cook their food, and Wrangham argues Homo erectus emerged about two million years ago as a result of this unique trait. ... Wrangham points out that humans are highly evolved for eating cooked food and cannot maintain reproductive fitness with raw food.

[00:20:39] <MichaelLong> arg, huge
[00:20:53] <sysRPL> from the textbook -> When Fire Met Food, The Brains Of Early Humans Grew Bigger : The Salt Because we had better food, our brains grew bigger than those of our primate cousins, scientists say. Early humans cooked, which makes meat and veggies more digestible and nutrients more available to the body.
[00:21:37] <sysRPL> They noticed (haven't we all?) that humans have very big brains. But they point out that gorillas and orangutans have bigger bodies than we do by far, but smaller brains and fewer neurons. Normally, brain size pretty much matches body size in primates. So how did we get so well-endowed?
[00:21:37] <sysRPL> We cooked.

[00:21:53] <sysRPL> are you people not read?
[00:22:02] <sysRPL> cookign gave us bigger brains. period
[00:22:28] <bomb> at least spell it correctly lol
[00:22:32] <sysRPL> the fact that some of you don't understand that scares me
[00:22:35] <MichaelLong> I'm more a podcast guy
[00:24:32] <sysRPL> cooking food breaks it down by an external energy source thereby causing out digestive system to spend less energy to convert what we eat into nutrients we can use
[00:24:41] <sysRPL> is is that hard to understand?
[00:26:06] <sysRPL> those excess nutrients were used by our ancestors to select individuals with bigger brains, which requires a lot more nutrients to build
[00:27:44] <sysRPL> and about whales ... total brain size is all that is important to intelligence. it's median brain volume to median body size that's important
[00:28:03] <sysRPL> * total brain size is NOT all that is important to intelligence

[06:17:07] <DevJohnC> the documentation says it's cryptographically random
[06:17:19] <DevJohnC> the src you linked is using a cryptographic provider

[08:45:19] <tsujp> But I have to manually get migrations EF tracks and undo them instead of just being able to call a method EF provides? God forbid anyone would ever want to revert a migration
[08:46:53] <tsujp> This is annoying because there is no good reason I can think of to make it so hard for the developer to revert/rollback/undo a migration. Applying one is easy so reverting should be easy. It's not like this is a preview library or something so having one have a nice API and the other some draconian one is just arbitrary and annoying

[10:34:24] <tsujp> Should I make an enum of cloud vendors a table with rows of the values I allow and then an FK constraint to that table; or a column on a table with a constraint on the column
[10:34:41] <tsujp> I plan to use the same enum over N tables, so I am leaning towards the seperate table with rows and FK constraint
[10:35:00] <tsujp> Then any changes to the enum in future are done in a single place: it's own table and the FK cosntraints around the place are all automatically up to date
[10:35:05] <tsujp> Like say renaming an enum value for instance
[10:35:06] <jmer> tsujp: what database are you using?

[10:38:36] <JakeSays> jmer: some dogs bark because they want to fuck :p
[10:38:49] <moose> However, their behavior with respect to actually updating them in dependent code exhibits the same feature that you need to recompile your dependency to update the respective underlying value.

[10:38:59] <moose> JakeSays: How's that sound, brah?

[10:40:19] <JakeSays> tsujp: ah ok. your responses didn't indicate as much
[10:40:24] <tsujp> jmer why would I need to recompile my code to add a new customer?

[10:41:10] <tsujp> idk what you guys are saying but saying "you need to recompile code to view changes" is a non-statement and has nothing to do with enums IMHO
[10:41:11] <jmer> tsujp: I... Didn't say that at all...
[10:41:23] <moose> jmer: I think once a week is a minimum system requirement for me.
[10:41:29] <moose> So I can imagine others are like twice daily.

[10:41:34] <jmer> tsujp: I am questioning your idea of representing the contents of an enum in c# as a SQL table.
[10:41:36] <moose> Just like coffee addicts, they get upset
[10:42:04] <tsujp> jmer how else would you represent that contents then?
[10:42:22] <JakeSays> tsujp: what's the purpose of having a table for a c# enum?
[10:42:32] <jmer> tsujp: Either not using an enum, but a data structure that doesn't need a code recompile to get new values, or simply using an enum without any backing SQL table.
[10:43:09] <tsujp> The purpose is to restrict the value of a column in N tables to a certain value
[10:43:11] <jmer> moose: I would say mine is "As often as possible" :D
[10:43:36] <jmer> tsujp: then use a normal table with a foreign key constraint.
[10:43:38] <tsujp> Think of a VirtualNetwork entity, there is a column "Cloud", the values of which can be either "AZURE" or "AWS" or "GCP"
[10:43:47] <jmer> and don't represent this as an enum in C#
[10:44:03] <JakeSays> tsujp: that should be done in the c# code that's doing the inserting
[10:44:04] <jmer> You don't need a SQL table to restrict values in a C# enum
[10:44:08] <tsujp> That's what I said at the start lol, you can have that C# enum map to a table with a FK constraint in ApplicationDbContext
[10:44:17] <jmer> tsujp: but what's the point?
[10:44:28] <tsujp> If it's not an enum in c# someone can try and insert "sdaasdsdaadsasdasdasd"
[10:44:45] <jmer> tsujp: if you put it in a database table you're kinda supporting the assumption the data can be changed without recompiling the code. But if you represent this data as an enum in C# that's not the case.
[10:44:50] <JakeSays> tsujp: so you allow random inserts in to your db?
[10:45:40] <tsujp> JakeSays, no... but when you create a new entity if the parameter that maps to that FK constraint isn't typed then you can pass "adsadssd" and it won't know whether or not that is valid until it tries the insert
[10:45:52] <tsujp> So now the FK constraint at the DB level is decoupled from the codebase
[10:45:55] <tsujp> Which is bad, no?
[10:46:27] <tsujp> jmer Apologies, these are string enums not integer enums
[10:47:55] <JakeSays> tsujp: you should be validating the data before it ever reaches the db
[10:47:56] <jamea> jmer worked thanks
[10:48:10] <tsujp> JakeSays so like I said "So now the FK constraint at the DB level is decoupled from the codebase"
[10:48:24] <JakeSays> why would you want that
[10:48:35] <tsujp> You JUST SAID "you should be validating the data before it ever reaches the db"
[10:48:41] <JakeSays> yes
[10:48:54] <tsujp> So I wouldn't want it, as I said
[10:49:01] <JakeSays> you should want it
[10:49:17] <JakeSays> put the logic where the logic belongs - in the business logic layer
[10:49:55] <_genuser_> be nice to him. at least he's not using oracle.
[10:50:03] <tsujp> And don't enforce the enum at all at the actual database layer?
[10:50:07] <tsujp> Only ever enforce it in c#?
[10:50:22] <JakeSays> yes
[10:50:45] <tsujp> So then if I want to rename "AWS" to "AMAZON" I need to walk through every single record in the database and update that _and then also_ recompile my code with the new enum?
[10:51:24] <JakeSays> you would need to do that regardless
[10:51:41] <moose> If you had designed things differently, you wouldn't have to do that
[10:51:45] <JakeSays> if you rename aws to amazon, the enumerant needs to be renamed as well
[10:53:08] <tsujp> idk it just seems arbitrary that in this case you don't propagate that to the database but for entities themselves you do. Why not just have a single table with infinite columns if everything is only meant to be in c#? In my example in this message that's probably for the performance of the database, ACIDidty blah blah blah

[10:59:51] <tsujp> Does no one see the fallacy here of maximum string length being propagated down to the database but an enum via FK constraint not?
[11:00:02] <JakeSays> MatthiasVance: that was never even part of the discussion
[11:00:08] <tsujp> If the argument is "don't put business logic stuff in the db" why does `[Maxlength(24)]` do that?
[11:00:36] <tsujp> It seems like EFs conventions are arbitrarily picked with no actual pattern to them
[11:00:37] <JakeSays> tsujp: that's just an attribute on a data entity.
[11:00:48] <tsujp> Yep and it's propogated down to the database JakeSays

[11:04:40] <tsujp> Okay so you believe that if I enforce [Maxlength(24)] on some property (ignoring the fact that EF code-first is generating nvarchar(24)) it should be nvarchar(max) at the db level?
[11:05:12] <tsujp> So if I have to run a query sometime and change that value I'm just supposed to know that some column should be 24 -- because there's no propagation of those constraints to the actual database
[11:05:34] <tsujp> I find it strange that EF also propagates FK constraints if business logic should be in the C# business layer then
[11:05:52] <JakeSays> lol hey ef is just one way of skinning a cat.
[11:06:00] <tsujp> Surely the business logic of an Author writing a Book does not deserve a FK constraint between the Author and Book tables, right?
[11:06:38] <JakeSays> do you code authors writing books? that's an interesting application
[11:06:49] <JakeSays> personally i let the author do that
[11:07:08] <tsujp> My gripe here is that, in typical Microsoft fashion, the rules about what to do are fast and loose and there's 0 canonical explanation
[11:07:41] <JakeSays> that's because you should create rules that fit your business best, and not rely on ms to do it for you.
[11:08:13] <JakeSays> don't be mad at ms for giving you a tool with lots of flexibility
[11:08:19] <tsujp> Rails ORM does a very, very good job of explaining "you do X it does this and these are the patterns to follow" but clearly here the convention of "don't put business constraints at the db level, put them only in the business logic layer" is (1) broken by EF itself (2) assumed to always be true by you (3) assumed to be arbitrarily enforced by me --
[11:08:19] <tsujp> and that's very frustrating
[11:09:17] <JakeSays> well, 2) is my personal best practice. it's worked better than anything else that i've come across.
[11:09:46] <JakeSays> what i'm saying is, do what's right for your use case and stop being frustrated

[12:06:38] <MaNa3k> moose, im talking about via the CLI
[12:06:46] <MaNa3k> i know you can do that in the ui
[12:06:58] <moose> Your question should've been more clear then aye
[12:07:21] <MaNa3k> moose, maybe. i kind of did mention the CLI
[12:07:44] <moose> You mentioned "with cli start" which any reasonable person would think you were speaking about setting up multiple console apps as startup projects
[12:07:53] <MaNa3k> anyway. when i type "dotnet start" nothing happens
[12:08:13] <moose> I am also not sure why you need to really do that, given that startup projects are purely for debugging
[12:08:33] <MaNa3k> moose, well i am kind of debugging, so thats why
[12:08:52] <moose> try dotnet run
[12:08:58] <MaNa3k> i have this timertigger function, which i call via this console app automatically, because im too lazy to do it via postman
[12:09:17] <MaNa3k> moose, to do that, i need to be inside a spesific project
[12:09:22] <MaNa3k> so it dosnt work
[12:09:36] <moose> Why can't you use --project?
[12:10:33] <MaNa3k> i get this error
[12:10:34] <MaNa3k> Unable to run your project. Ensure you have a runnable project type and ensure 'dotnet run' supports this project. A runnable project should target a runnable TFM (for instance, net5.0) and have OutputType 'Exe'. The current OutputType is 'Library'.
[12:10:37] <MaNa3k> when i run dotnet run
[12:10:49] <moose> Well you're trying to run a library
[12:10:50] <MaNa3k> when im inside the function app directory
[12:10:56] <MaNa3k> dir
[12:10:58] <moose> What kind of project is this, asp .net or what?
[12:10:59] <MaNa3k> ops
[12:11:07] <MaNa3k> its a function timer app
[12:11:14] <moose> So why are you trying to run the library
[12:11:25] <MaNa3k> moose, let me tell you, i just recently started using the cli, so im a total noob
[12:11:30] <moose> It's ok
[12:11:43] <moose> I am not trying to make you feel bad or anything, just trying to get you to think about why this error is happening :p
[12:11:47] <MaNa3k> its a .NET 6 app
[12:11:53] <moose> So you are trying to run a library, but libraries can't just run alone
[12:12:04] <moose> I assume your .NET 6  app is a console app or a WPF app, right?
[12:12:04] <MaNa3k> moose, its not a library
[12:12:14] <MaNa3k> it runs when i run from vs22 ui
[12:12:17] <moose> Well, the project's output type is set to "library" according to your message
[12:12:24] <MaNa3k> hmm
[12:12:31] <moose> Do you think the project you are in the directory of is a library perhaps?
[12:12:35] <MaNa3k> i see
[12:12:39] <MaNa3k> dir
[12:12:41] <MaNa3k> ops
[12:12:44] <moose> lol
[12:12:46] <MaNa3k> ah
[12:12:48] <MaNa3k> i see
[12:12:54] <MaNa3k> im not in the bin folder, stupid me
[12:13:40] <MaNa3k> wtf, theres no exe
[12:13:50] <MaNa3k> as you were telling
[12:14:36] <MaNa3k> wtf is going on, how was visual studio running this app then ?
[12:14:47] <MaNa3k> theres only dll in the bin folder
[12:14:59] <jmer> MaNa3k: how many projects do you have?
[12:15:08] <moose> Is it a console app or a WPF app or an ASP .NET app?

[12:15:19] <MaNa3k> moose, its a function timer app
[12:15:25] <moose> I have no idea what that is frankly
[12:15:37] <jmer> MaNa3k: then you would have more than one bin folder I assume
[12:15:39] <moose> Which project type did you use?
[12:15:44] <MaNa3k> it basically works like an api, but with a timer
[12:15:49] <jmer> MaNa3k: make sure you're trying to run the project that is in fact runnable.
[12:15:51] <moose> Is there really a "function timer" project type?
[12:16:03] <MaNa3k> moose, yes
[12:16:04] <moose> Never seen it, but I suspect then it's like one of those serverless appengine things?
[12:16:06] <jmer> MaNa3k: What project is set as the startup project in VS?
[12:16:17] <MaNa3k> just create a function first, then select timer triggere app

[12:17:27] <jmer> Sooo Azure Functions?
[12:17:34] <MaNa3k> jmer, but also another console app is, but its only to trigger this function timer app so that i dont have to do it via postman. The function timer app is totally runnable by it selv
[12:17:45] <MaNa3k> jmer, yes, but made via visual studio template
[12:18:12] <MaNa3k> jmer, basically, i have 2 apps that i have setup to run simultaneously in the ui
[12:18:39] <MaNa3k> and they run oki from vs22, but when i try from the cli, it dosnt work
[12:19:19] <jmer> probably because VS is smart enough to recognize this is Azure functions
[12:20:36] <jmer> MaNa3k: https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools
[12:23:18] <jmer> the thing on that link is needed to run them locally
[12:27:36] <tsujp> Is there a LINQ predicate which will walk up BaseType until it's a specific value?
[12:28:27] <tsujp> In my ApplicationDbContext I do `builder.Entity<T>().HasQueryFilter(e => !e.DeletedTimestamp.HasValue);` but `e` can be a class which inherits from a base type and filters can only be on the root type
[12:28:55] <tsujp> I could do a while loop before that but I am wondering (and looking at docs now) if there's a LINQ predicate
[12:34:50] <canton7> You can do it with a `for` loop, so you can probably coerce `Aggregate` into doing it?
[12:38:01] <tsujp> Oh I cannot use Aggregate on it, might be able to define my own LINQ query on that type though lemme try that
[12:40:39] <tsujp> Mmk EntityTypeBuilder is the thing to extend here
[12:44:15] <tsujp> Oh my mistake here, it looks like the actual method HasQueryFilter is just that.. a method but it's parameter is a lambda which is used as a LINQ predicate `e => !e.DeletedTimestamp.HasValue` if I understand correctly
[12:44:27] <tsujp> So what I really want here is just an extension method on the EntityTypeBuilder class

[15:29:53] <jmer> I have about 10 ms latency

[15:30:22] <jmer> if I ping my router I can get 1ms MaNa3k  :P

[16:21:27] <jmer> Yay!
[16:21:31] <MaNa3k> got now 32gb
[16:21:51] <bpmedley> MOAR RAM!!
[16:21:56] <jmer> Well... The dev with most time on this project posted a message that after VS22 he has experienced timeout issues when debugging our stuff
[16:22:04] <jmer> and it was solved with "MOAR RAM"
[16:23:39] <MaNa3k> jmer, well i was for some reason always running at 80-90% ram usages, mostly because i have lots of tabs in brows, outlook, vs19, postman, ssms, storage account explorer, and teams running all the time
[16:23:56] <MaNa3k> everything was lagging
[16:24:06] <MaNa3k> and got more, and it fixed the issue
[16:24:17] <MaNa3k> now i have another problem, the battery capacity is below 50%

[16:41:36] <Shariff> Interesting.. I've never done that yet.. looking into that now, thanks!

[18:13:02] <MaNa3k> jmer, yea im not ever gonna work 24hours, i dont think thats even allowed lol
[18:13:28] <MaNa3k> longeest ive worked is maybe 15hours or so i think i a day
[18:13:41] <MaNa3k> but then we get free dinner
[18:13:54] <MaNa3k> and 50% more for extra hours
[18:14:08] <jmer> that's not bad
[18:14:12] <MaNa3k> and ofcourse the governemnt have to fuck with you and tax you double
[18:14:18] <jmer> what?
[18:14:22] <MaNa3k> for the extra time you worked
[18:14:32] <jmer> ... So you're taxed extra for working extra hours?
[18:14:40] <MaNa3k> yup
[18:15:22] <jmer> Doesn't that affect low income families more then? I Mean... they would be taxed extra even though they might make as much as a higher paid employee, yet for the same fiscal amount?
[18:15:51] <MaNa3k> jmer, thats the problem in norway, people are actually poor, the country is rich
[18:16:35] <jmer> I think I prefer a progressive tax model instead.

[18:18:02] <MaNa3k> 50% might not be correct, but your deffinetly taxed more if you work more then 100%
[18:19:31] <jmer> how many hours makes up 100%?
[18:20:04] <MaNa3k> 7,5
[18:20:26] <MaNa3k> lunch is not included in that
[18:20:32] <MaNa3k> lunch is your own time
[18:20:44] <jmer> So it's per day?
[18:21:02] <jmer> So you could just register your extra hours as Saturday and Sunday hours and you wouldn't be taxed extra?
[18:21:08] <MaNa3k> yes, 7,5 hr a day
[18:21:26] <MaNa3k> dont know
[18:21:42] <MaNa3k> actually its 37,5 normal hours a week
[18:21:56] <MaNa3k> so above that is overtime if i remember it correctly
[18:22:05] <jmer> What if you work for a company that says 38 hours is a work week? will you be taxed extra?
[18:22:44] <MaNa3k> dont know
[18:23:03] <MaNa3k> i think most works here arent more then 37,5hrs
[18:23:46] <jmer> the normal weekly work time is 37 hours here, but I've had employers that had 38 and alsol 37,5
[18:24:09] <MaNa3k> mhm
[18:24:49] <jmer> What if you have an employer that says that extra hours aren't paid, but it increases the value of allready worked hours in that month?
[18:25:11] <jmer> Would that avoid the tax? :D
[18:25:31] <MaNa3k> i think its law that says that you get paid overtime if you work more than 7,5hr
[18:25:33] <MaNa3k> a day
[18:27:29] <MaNa3k> so checking my payslipp, i get taxed by a value in a table base of my yearly salary rate or somthing, and all the overtime i do i have to tax around 34%
[18:27:57] <jmer> That's so dumb
[18:28:05] <jmer> you're basically taxing poor people harder than rich people

[18:30:34] <MaNa3k> *34%
[18:31:55] <MaNa3k> every year you can ofc do tax refunds of you have some posts you can will
[18:32:14] <MaNa3k> but normally the rich people get most of their taxes back
[18:33:13] <MaNa3k> anyone im outta here, cya later
[18:33:18] <MaNa3k> *anyway
[18:34:43] <riksteri> Is that 34% an actual payment or the amoutn they withhold in advance and possibly pay back in the refunds?
[18:35:42] <riksteri> if it works like on other countries, where the payslip shows what was withheld, and only after the year is done they calculate how much you owe and were you withheld too much or too little.
