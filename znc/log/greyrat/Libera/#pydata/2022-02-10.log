[15:38:41] <Arrinao_> What am I doing wrong here? https://dpaste.com/7JPLWZZ8Q
[15:39:07] <Arrinao_> I'm getting this error: ValueError: Wrong number of items passed 2, placement implies 1
[16:35:20] <jboy> I have a csv file with 3.4 million records in four columns. `pandas.read_csv` locked up my computer. What's my best bet: upload to HPC cluster and work there, or read into sqlite database and then into pandas?
[17:29:11] <jboy> nevermind, I think chunksize should do the trick
[17:44:37] <mefistofeles> Arrinao_: what do you want to accomplish with that code?

[18:05:39] <Arrinao_> researching how exactly .apply() works

[18:13:45] <mefistofeles> Arrinao_: ok, then it seems that you are using it wrong, do you want to add 2 to age and make that a new column?
[18:13:46] <jboy> Arrinao_: you should use isinstance, not type(x) == y.
[18:14:13] <Arrinao_> mefistofeles yeah
[18:14:37] <mefistofeles> Arrinao_: then you don't need apply for that, just df['newcol'] = df['prev_col'] + 2
[18:14:43] <Arrinao_> jboy hmm you may be right but I tested this and it seems to work too :/
[18:15:24] <Arrinao_> mefistofeles I see, but if I still wanted to use apply?
[18:15:48] <Arrinao_> this is really about finding out how apply works :D
[18:16:55] <Arrinao_> I'm wondering about the error
[18:17:03] <mefistofeles> Arrinao_: in that case you want to apply to all columns so axis would be 0, but it's just not the way apply is meant to be used, tbh
[18:17:23] <Arrinao_> ah, axis 1 are rows?
[18:37:50] <mefistofeles> Arrinao_: you might want to dig into the differences between apply, applymap and map
[18:38:03] <mefistofeles> also you can apply directly to a series (column)
