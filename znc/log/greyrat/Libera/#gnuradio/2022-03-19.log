[00:07:06] <bpadalino> flash[m]: i came across this a while ago, and i haven't done anything with it .. https://github.com/jledet/waterfall
[00:07:10] <bpadalino> but it looked very promising
[00:07:55] <flash[m]> great. thanks
[00:09:26] <muaddib[m]> I have a version of this waterfall project that works with ZMQ.
[00:10:03] <muaddib[m]> I can push it up later.
[00:10:07] <flash[m]> that could be awesome
[00:12:06] <muaddib[m]> The idea was to separate out the UHD and FFT blocks and replace them with just a ZMQ sink.  Now you can do your own FFT/power calculations and just send the vectors into the server. It works well. I’m not at my comp now but will be in a couple hours.

[02:26:30] <tnt> So ... what fun can you have with a wide-band coherent quad receiver ?
[02:27:43] <patchvonbraun[m]> tnt: DFing, aperture-synthesis interferometry
[02:35:33] <muaddib[m]> Yea, 4 element phased array to the max
[02:36:45] *** Quits: shibboleth (~shibbolet@user/shibboleth) (Quit: shibboleth)
[02:36:48] <patchvonbraun[m]> tnt: So, what wide-band coherent RX are you thinking about?
[02:38:32] <tnt> patchvonbraun[m]: a couple of ADRV9009.
[02:38:53] <tnt> I think my main issue would be antennas ... I don't think I even have 4 of the same antennas for any band.
[02:41:27] <patchvonbraun[m]> tnt: Well, you clearly need to get the tools out :)
[02:41:45] <patchvonbraun[m]> Do you have boards with ADRV9009 on them, or just theoretical?
[02:43:05] <tnt> patchvonbraun[m]: No, I have the dev board. Just finished the (overcomplicated) sequence so synchronize them so I was wondering if there was anything fun I could try with them.
[02:43:22] <tnt> ATM they're just wired to a 1:4 splitter off a siggen to check they are indeed coherent.
[02:43:36] <flash[m]> all 4 channels are coherent?
[02:43:42] <tnt> yes.
[02:45:03] <patchvonbraun[m]> tnt: Noice.  You must have a wealthy sugar-{momma,daddy}  :)
[02:45:25] <tnt> They are a big "deaf" though. I mean compared to a 9361 for instance. You can feel than they're meant to have some front end in front of them.
[02:45:55] <tnt> patchvonbraun[m]: well board isn't mine, I'll probably have to give it back :(
[02:46:24] <patchvonbraun[m]> They have greater baseband bandwidth, and have an explicit multi-chip synch feature. But they seem very AD9361x-esque
[02:46:52] <tnt> they're more like the ad9371 
[02:47:12] <patchvonbraun[m]> Which is 9361 with a few improvements
[02:47:36] <tnt> "few" ...
[02:48:18] <tnt> But the 9371 is also "deaf". Which is why the N300 has like 40 dB of gain in front of it, while the B200 doesn't have any external RX gain.
[02:49:22] <Jacob[m]12> Both the 9009 and 9371 have some disadvantages compared to 9361 too, mostly related to clocking and power
[02:49:24] <tnt> (at max gain, it reaches 0 dBFS on the ADC when the input is -11 dBm on the input)
[02:49:57] <tnt> Jacob[m]12: oh yeah, theses chips are a f* pain. They're not meant for general purpose SDRs. 
[02:50:02] <Jacob[m]12> That said the input linearity is amazing. The 9004 is pretty damn awesome too
[02:50:45] *** Quits: filename (~kilitary@188.242.105.134) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02:52:57] <patchvonbraun[m]> The N32x series doesn't even use the AD93 series chips.  They went back to discrete mixer/synth/ADC
[02:54:13] <tnt> Probably a good idea for a general purpose SDR :)
[02:55:19] *** Quits: vekay (~vekay@user/vekay) (Quit: Leaving)
[02:57:44] <muaddib[m]> after a lot of help from patchvonbraun , i was measuring relative phase between 2 channels within 0.01degrees on the N321  
[02:57:54] <muaddib[m]> * lot of setup help from
[02:59:09] <tnt> wow 0.01 deg ?!? Damn.
[03:00:24] <tnt> Here the multi chip sync isn't that precise. You're like at ~ 1 deg uncertainty or so.
[03:01:22] <bpadalino> tnt: the LNA's for the 9361's weren't super great so i imagine it was just better/easier to leave them off and not worry about them for other devices .. i believe the adrv9002 is similar without other lna's and whatnot
[03:02:21] <bpadalino> tnt: you could try to do some beam nulling on receive to try to get rid of annoying signals i guess .. the DF thing sounds like you can do some interesting stuff
[03:02:41] <patchvonbraun[m]> For my applications, I"m ALWAYS going to have filtered LNAs at the antenna.  Sure, I'd like there to be a bit of not-horrible gain in front of the mixers, but it doesn't have to be super low noise.
[03:02:45] <bpadalino> i have been playing with an rfsoc design which borrows from the JESD204 SYSREF signal to achieve their coherency
[03:03:26] <bpadalino> i am a little surprised ADI hasn't just adopted that but then again there are a decent number of caveats to using it
[03:03:59] <tnt> bpadalino: they use sysref to sync the phase of the RF LO.
[03:04:10] <bpadalino> but not the data converters themselves ?
[03:04:16] <patchvonbraun[m]> My impression is that getting a bunch of frac-N synthesizers to all agree in agonizing detail on phase is a bit like herding cats.  Which is why a design that simply is N mixers and a single LO is more appealing.
[03:05:01] <bpadalino> i was looking up the LMX2572 which apparently supports phase synchronization across multiple devices .. looks like a neat device in general
[03:05:01] <tnt> bpadalino: well yeah, they also use sysref to sync the converters, that's what it's meant for originally :)
[03:05:44] <bpadalino> tnt: oh, ok .. so i guess i am confused what the complex multi device synchronization situation was ..
[03:05:48] <bpadalino> if it's just sysref
[03:06:10] <tnt> bpadalino: oh it's just the API sucks and the documentation doesn't match :)
[03:06:15] <bpadalino> OH! got it
[03:06:36] <bpadalino> does the 9009 have a little blob of mcu code you need to squirt into it ?
[03:06:48] <tnt> it's not so little :)
[03:07:30] <tnt> it can also change depending on your config ... so you have to use their gui to generate a profile which has the various config and it will spit out some binary blobs you need to feed the API.
[03:07:59] <bpadalino> that sounds not so great .. but i guess if you're just building one profile and you're done .. it's somewhat easy to do
[03:08:38] <tnt> yeah. That's what I meant by "not for general purpose SDR". It's flexible sure, but not at runtime.
[03:11:22] <tnt> bpadalino: how are the rfsoc btw ? Haven't had the chance to come across one yet :)
[03:12:37] <bpadalino> they are very much like other xilinx devices where the datasheet says a lot about nothing ..
[03:12:54] <bpadalino> so 300 pages for a document .. and then still doesn't answer the questions you have about it
[03:13:12] <bpadalino> they have some drivers to try to interact with it, but they aren't great in my opinion
[03:13:34] <bpadalino> like, software good enough for the demo .. but not good enough for a real product
[03:14:12] <tnt> tbh sounds a bit like the sw for the dev board I have for the adrv9009 :)
[03:14:37] <bpadalino> i am just working with a gen3 device .. so faster ADC/DACs .. and i am not using the FEC at the moment
[03:14:54] <bpadalino> the zcu208 is pretty neat for a kit .. but for $13k i sure hope it would be
[03:15:11] <bpadalino> so do you have a single adrv9009 dev board with 4 chains in it ?
[03:15:20] <bpadalino> so 2 devices ?
[03:15:55] <tnt> ADRV9009-ZU11EG on ADRV2CRR-FMC carrier.
[03:15:55] <bpadalino> FMCOMMS8 ?
[03:15:59] <bpadalino> oh ..
[03:16:18] <bpadalino> nice
[03:16:37] <bpadalino> what's the plan to do with that?
[03:16:56] <tnt> Ah well, that I can't say ... work stuff :)
[03:17:23] <bpadalino> understandable .. but bummer :)
[03:18:25] <tnt> I did do litex support for it though: https://github.com/litex-hub/litex-boards/blob/master/litex_boards/platforms/adi_adrv2crr_fmc.py
[03:18:37] <tnt> Not that I expect many hobbyist to have one lying around ...
[03:18:48] <bpadalino> what are your thoughts on litex ?
[03:19:18] <bpadalino> i did some stuff with OpenCPI and it was abysmal
[03:20:50] <tnt> A bit mixed ... On one hand it's kind of convenient. It has a cost in term of resource of course.  It also depends on the target. I've been hitting quite a few issues because well Zynq UltraScale+ aren't exactly the most common devices so support for some stuff was a bit spotty.
[03:21:15] <tnt> But the maintainer has been great at providing support and helping me through it.
[03:21:39] <bpadalino> it's nice that they're responsive ..
[03:21:54] <bpadalino> in a ZU11 you have some room to give up resources for convenience ..
[03:21:55] <bpadalino> so that's good
[03:22:53] <tnt> yeah exactly. That's why I decided to try it for this project. Like if I work on an ice40 or ecp5, I'm saving resources ... here ... meh.

[14:43:54] <JayKA1PQK[m]> Hi all - very novice gnuRadio person here and ran into a possible issue that I'd like a 2nd (or more) opinion on.  
[14:43:54] <JayKA1PQK[m]> I'm using the RRC Filter block (convenience wrapper) in gnuradio companion and think it should expose the sample delay parameter of the underlying FIR filter, which I don't think it does.  Am I missing something?  
[14:43:54] <JayKA1PQK[m]> I was sending a tagged stream though the RRC filter and the tags were coming out ahead of the result.  When I recreated the same flow using an FIR filter and setting the sample delay appropriately, the tags lined up with the results.
