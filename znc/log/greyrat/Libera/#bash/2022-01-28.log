[03:34:09] <zeamp> The channel is bash, I would assume bash-based answers.
[03:34:17] <zeamp> If you're looking for alternative solutions, you might try an alternative channel?
[03:34:46] <hentai> zeamp, I recall this channel to be the "Why bash is not going to solve your problem" one-stop shop
[03:35:12] <hentai> This was a long time ago, but I presumed this to hold true to this day
[03:35:20] <zeamp> Your name suggests much more.
[03:35:29] <zeamp> Afraid my hands are tai'd.
[03:35:31] <Blondie101010> zeamp: translate what you said in bash syntax and if it doesn't work, paste it so we can look
[03:35:41] <mknod> Bash is definitely the tool for the job.
[03:35:48] * Blondie101010 nods
[03:36:06] <zeamp> This is the first time I've typed in this channel since COVID began.
[03:36:07] <mknod> You'll want to use "touch" for more than just creating a blank file, also.
[03:36:25] <hentai> mknod, So nobody will say "Dont reinvent the wheel and use the proven rsync" or "Do not try to do this in bash, instead try something like python or a proper language"
[03:36:55] <hentai> zeamp, This is the first time I've typed in this channel since I tested positive for COVID
[03:37:03] <hentai> Because I did yesterday :)

[03:38:00] <Friithian> hey I'm young enough to be a kid in this saying
[03:39:06] <hentai> Also, as I am certain that the mere existence of my solution in this case would lead to at least a single inexplicable migraine in this world among bash gurus, can someone point me to a "true and only" way to take ctime of one file, and apply it to a different one
[03:39:45] *** Quits: m0viefreak (~asdf@user/m0viefreak) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:40:16] <kurahaupo1> hentai: ctime is there to indelibly record when the other metadata are modified.
[03:40:34] <kurahaupo1> hentai: it's intentionally impossible to change it, other than to set it to the current time
[03:40:44] <phogg> tl;dr use touch, change mtime
[03:40:44] <hentai> kurahaupo1, touch?
[03:40:47] <Friithian> sounds easily possible to change it then :P
[03:40:50] <kurahaupo1> hentai: but why do you care about ctime?
[03:40:51] <Friithian> just change system time

[03:41:15] <kurahaupo1> Friithian: yeah, and then be very precise about when you call "touch"
[03:41:24] <hentai> Pardon, covid gotta have touched the brain facilities, I did mean mtime, not ctime
[03:41:35] <kurahaupo1> hentai: touch --ref=otherfile thisfile
[03:41:44] <hentai> Thank you very much
[03:41:48] <Friithian> god that would not be fun, a script to change system time so you can set the time on a file correctly
[03:41:50] <kurahaupo1> probably touch -c to prevent it creating a new file
[03:42:12] <phogg> there is a way to set ctime... on Linux, if with ext filesystems (by using debugfs). I will say no more
[03:42:13] <mknod> Ah, even simpler if there is no date manipulation indeed.
[03:42:23] <kurahaupo1> Friithian: and then cancel all the alarms caused by the system clock going bananas

[03:43:09] <hentai> What should I use in this second, completely unrelated case?
[03:43:32] <hentai> Certainly implementing FTP on bash using /dev/tcp does not sound fun

[03:46:36] <hentai> kurahaupo1, I have loaded over a TB of music off a private FTP server, and hardly noticed that I messed up the timestamps on the loaded files
[03:47:28] <Friithian> why are the timestamps so important?
[03:47:29] <hentai> My original IP was banned for using too much traffic, so loading it again is not a viable option :)
[03:48:00] <hentai> Friithian, FOR DEH HISTORY! I am going to archive that epic FTP while it is still alive
[03:48:08] <Friithian> ah
[03:48:17] <phogg> I timestamp all of my ripped audio based on the release date of the source album
[03:48:22] <kurahaupo1> hentai: depending on the file format, it might have "recording timestamp" included inside it. I would be inclined to set the mtime to that.

[03:51:19] <phogg> there is too much variation of opinion on what is legal id3

[03:51:49] <Friithian> manually fix it like I do
[03:52:02] <phogg> chuck it all and tag via extended filesystem attributes!
[03:52:08] <hentai> id3 skews the checksums of the file. If you want metadata in the file, use matroska containers
[03:52:41] <phogg> BeFS had it figured out 25 years ago.
[03:52:50] <hentai> I hate using filesystem attributes for any data of value
[03:52:51] <Friithian> would you be happy with id3 but the tags are in a seperate file?
[03:53:04] <hentai> Friithian, Exactly what I mean by "non-invasive"
[03:53:21] <Friithian> hmm, an idea is forming in my mind and it's a *bad* one

[06:37:16] <e36freak> right
[06:37:36] <userT> Ok.
[06:37:43] <e36freak> quotes are important

[06:38:07] <e36freak> (though quoting there certainly doesn't hurt either)
[06:38:32] <userT> So in bash, with [[ it doesn't really matter whether quoting or not? I'm free on it?
[06:38:40] <e36freak> [[ is special
[06:38:53] <emanuele6> only in [[ and only in some contexts
[06:38:56] <e36freak> [ is a command, like any other command. it doesn't do anything special with what's inside

[06:39:25] <e36freak> for unary tests, like -n or -z, quotes aren't needed because no wordsplitting occurs
[06:39:41] <e36freak> for equality tests, the right side needs to be quoted unless you want it treated as a shell pattern to match against

[06:40:19] <userT> Yes, I did know that [ is the "test" command, and [[ is kind of a bash-ism
[06:40:37] <e36freak> but because [ is just a command, quoting rules apply just like any other command
[06:40:46] <bn_work> hi, we have a "requirement" to launch ~17 processes in parallel to "minimize start times" but the simultaneous logging of everything to stdout seems to be dropping log messages when initially viewed, why? & anything we can do prevent this besides launching them serially?
[06:40:53] <emanuele6> [[ is a special thing, not a command; similar to ((
[06:41:20] <userT> So, [ "$stg" ] and [ -n "$stg" ] are equivalent.

[07:48:07] <emanuele6> my guess a script pretending to be one, i don't think this can be a valid unit file
[07:48:21] <tirnanog> it's all kinds of wrong then.
[07:48:41] <bn_work> tirnanog:  there is no systemd, do not pass go, do not collect $200, welcome to container-hell
[07:48:53] <tirnanog> I see.
[07:51:09] <bn_work> I think some sort of race condition is still occurring
[07:51:54] <bn_work> tirnanog: java launcher scripts seem to use this launching method a lot
[07:52:12] <tirnanog> yes. I've had to fix more then my fair share of them. their authors should be hung.
[07:53:03] <tirnanog> in any case, yes, this code is racy - but also, you're performing expansions at the point that ExecStartPre is assigned. it's hokum, basically.
[07:53:52] <tirnanog> using a function would be a good start.
[07:54:38] <bn_work> tirnanog:  I'm still confused how the race conditions are occurring
[07:54:59] <tirnanog> it's outright broken, even before getting to the topic of race conditions.
[07:56:10] <bn_work> tirnanog:  besides the other points you made, how so?
[07:56:17] <bn_work> it does run
[07:56:38] <wiscii> do you know what in runs ?
[07:56:49] <wiscii> s/in/it
[07:57:01] <tirnanog> because every single variable expansion and command substitution is performed before you (needless) inject the code. at the very least, that's going to impact upon $date.
[07:57:29] <bn_work> wiscii: yes, as mentioned, it runs the java build tool generated jvm launcher script
[07:58:00] <wiscii> ok
[07:58:18] <bn_work> tirnanog: the date thing is such a minor detail, but I understand what you're saying though
[07:59:21] <tirnanog> in fact, the code isn't even valid.
[07:59:24] <tirnanog> the quotes are unbalanced.
[08:00:09] <tirnanog> I assume line #1 was supposed to end with a double quote. that aside, the above applies.
[08:00:31] <bn_work> tirnanog:  yes, that was a copy-paste sanitization error
[08:01:01] <bn_work> again though, how are race conditions happening?
[08:01:22] <wiscii> only for curiosity..

[08:03:04] <wiscii> ok, that was a bit unfair but i was only testing
[08:03:23] <bn_work> those shellcheck comments seem off... $date is used, re. the latter two, this is a snippet, not the full launcher "script"

[08:14:40] *** Joins: on^ (~on@50.231.5.242)
[08:20:10] <tirnanog> it's even easier in the case that you have the flock(1) utility in your environment. the basic idea is to have "Baz" maintain a hold over the lock file it is running (acheivable with a wrapper script in the event that it cannot do so itself). the snippet you just posted would then attempt to acquire the lock. if it failed to do so, Baz would be running.
[08:20:31] <tirnanog> while it is running, rather.
[08:21:01] <bn_work> isn't that what the PID file is?
[08:21:07] <bn_work> and the check for it?
[08:21:12] <tirnanog> no.
[08:21:22] <tirnanog> this is just one long sequence of race conditions, as it stands.
[08:21:30] <tirnanog> you begin with a TOCTOUT (if [[ -e)
[08:21:33] <tirnanog> TOCTOU*
[08:22:01] <bn_work> "TOCTOU"?

[08:30:58] <tirnanog> ideally, you would have the thing that binds the port lock or otherwise signal when it is up and ready to field connections rather than performing a test from without. that's something to consider if it's an application of your own design. in any case, there's no way that your present approach can be rendered race-free. at best, you could shorten the window times.

[11:24:51] <dan01> Why does ./script.sh run as script?
[11:25:05] <dan01> I mean ./ is just a path right? How come the script gets executed?
[11:25:19] <Soliton> what else do you expect?
[11:25:57] <dan01> Well I mean how come if you just write script.sh it won't get executed, but it works if you write ./script.sh?

[11:26:04] *** Joins: hid3 (~arnoldas@78.157.71.116)
[11:26:18] <Soliton> because if you give no path then it looks through PATH.
[11:26:20] <geirha> since you didn't provide a path, bash will look for the command in PATH instead

[11:27:20] <dan01> Then, what's the role of #!/bin/env bash, I've heard there's a difference between source script.sh and ./script.sh because source won't create a new subshell
[11:27:46] <dan01> But is the subshell created in ./ because of the #!/bin/bash thing? Or is that irrelevant to that?
[11:28:02] <Soliton> the shebang only plays a role if you call the script. if you source it it's just a comment.
[11:28:02] <Nintendo> I don't see the arbitrary code execution, but I did learn that (( )) does not equate any non-integer string as 0.
[11:28:21] <osse> dan01: script.sh isn't actually a binary exe file; it's just a text file. the role of that is to tell the kernel how to execute it
[11:28:29] <geirha> neither involves a subshell. If you exeecute another script, it will be run by another shell instance, whichever is set in the shebang
[11:29:33] <geirha> !#!
[11:29:33] <greybot> A script MUST begin with a #! line, called the "shebang" (from hash+bang). It tells the kernel what interpreter to run, to read your script. See <http://stackoverflow.com/a/733901/58803> and <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/CommandsAndArguments#Scripts> and <http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/>

[14:55:47] <bn_work> tirnanog: sorry, fell asleep, slumped over writing bash code last night.  Re. flock(1):  it seems it doesn't exist on OSX but does on Linux.  So I was reading its man page & https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/045 and am wondering how I would rewrite the above & deal with the PID file though? (or would the PID file become the lock file?  ex:  https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/045#CA-ab955f35824fa6a6c2dad7ae4ca84e27357c6f1d_1 )
[14:57:10] <Earnestly> Don't use pidfiles
[14:57:14] <tirnanog> you need a mutually agreed-upon path. it doesn't have to be a pid file.
[14:57:43] <tirnanog> how does the thing that is presently the subject of this pid file get launched to begink with? this "baz".
[14:59:30] <Earnestly> (I.e. forget pid files exist, like $0, force yourself to exclude them as potential solutions for anything)

[15:06:09] <tirnanog> I don't have the time to keep going over it at this point. suffice to say that the -e test is a race and walking the process table is a race. reading the pid file is a race; it proves nothing as concerns the state of the process you are intending to poll.

[15:08:03] <tirnanog> given that you are already using some wrapper script to lauch the application in question, you might have it acquire a file lock and simply run the application in the foreground. when the application exits, so will the wrapping script, and the lock will be automatically released (if using flock).
[15:08:37] <tirnanog> you then attempt to acquire the lock in this other script. a failure to acquire the lock means the application is running. it's not conceptually that complicated. I would encourage you to play around with the flock utility and get a sense of how it works in practice.
[15:08:48] <tirnanog> Earnestly: do you really want to see it?

[15:13:32] <Earnestly> But yeah, this is insane
[15:14:03] <Earnestly> I would mention pgrep, but it's entirely wrong approach, even with more sensible use of tooling
[15:14:25] <tirnanog> what I said earlier (aside from the ridiculous code assignment then injection) was to use a lock file if it absolutely must be known that some other script has launched something before proceeding to this connectivity polling routine.
[15:15:33] <tirnanog> and if there is no adequate supervisor to hand. that startup scripts originating from the java ecosystem are involved suggests that it would already be a mess.
[15:15:43] <Earnestly> There's too much to go over, and I have headache, everything is wrong

[15:16:58] <bn_work> tirnanog:  the problem is the container doesn't gracefully let processes end and it just leaves stale PID files around (AFAICT, I can disable the PID file creation by the app).  Also, BTW, I'm not trying to run multiple instances of the service, so wouldn't checking for those type of race conditions be overkill?

[15:19:42] <bn_work> Earnestly: it *was* a systemd unit, the only reason this bastardization of it exists is because people are foaming at the mouth for containers

[15:23:00] <jelly> Earnestly, this is when "supervisor" itself is started on a distro with sysvinit init scripts.
[15:23:05] <tirnanog> that's fine. don't worry about the pid file.

[15:24:01] <tirnanog> Earnestly: come to think of it, apline uses openrc doesn't it? though I'm not sure that these trendy containerized forms of apline would. anyway, openrc does provide supervise-daemon which, along with runscript deps, is better than nothing.
[15:24:28] <jelly> containers are supposed to be self-well,-contained

[15:24:48] <bn_work> tirnanog:  what?  you're acting as if I *want* to containerize this, I don't, I don't really have much of a say in this matter at all, I'm just trying to make the best of this situation
[15:24:55] <jelly> a container is supposed to run one process
[15:24:55] <tirnanog> ?
[15:25:13] <tirnanog> are you addressing that last remark to me in error?
[15:25:13] <Earnestly> jelly: No it can run many, but doesn't need init
[15:25:29] <jelly> Earnestly, it _can_, but it's not _supposed to_
[15:25:55] <tirnanog> I'm acting in no such fashion.
[15:26:09] <tirnanog> in fact, I never even questioned why it was being containerised.
[15:26:47] <Earnestly> jelly: I don't think you're right about that, much emphasis these days made on running logical groupings of software that provide some service
[15:27:17] <Earnestly> Often this means just one thing like web server
[15:27:22] <jelly> that's abuse of the original container idea
[15:27:26] <Earnestly> But api server can mean running several bits
[15:28:30] <Earnestly> bn_work: I would, as this is bodge job anyway, just use pgrep with specific flags to check if process running.  Still racy, but fewer races to lose
[15:29:05] <Earnestly> Have wrapper script use fifo as notification, create mini supervisor that responds to reads from fifo and does stuff.  It's about 10 lines of sh to have basic supervisor

[15:34:18] <tirnanog> the answer isn't going to chance for as long as you employ the present approach, as was stated earlier.
[15:34:21] <tirnanog> change*
[15:34:29] <tirnanog> anyway, Earnestly's idea is better than mine.
[15:35:29] <tirnanog> a blocking read loop on a fifo to which any number of scripts may signal their state would afford you a lot of power.

[15:52:42] <tirnanog> as you say, there's not much to test!
[15:53:04] <Earnestly> On the other hand, toybox is quite a nice bit of code.  Landley has done a good job on implementing things like ps to the best he can according to POSIX spec, but notes deviation when the spec is being silly
[15:53:21] <Earnestly> The comments are entertaining
[15:53:21] <bn_work> tirnanog: I understand what you're saying now, ie:  L1 evals the -e but it doesn't get run till L3, but I guess I don't understand what the race condition/risk if only one service is allowed to run anyway?
[15:54:09] <tirnanog> bn_work: you test the existence of the file before proceeding to perform some operation based on the existence of that test. there is no proof that the file does or doesn't exist at that point.
[15:54:44] <tirnanog> taken in isolation, an example of how it might be improved is to just use the read builtin to try to read from the file. if you read something successfuly, then - of course - it had to exist.
[15:54:54] <tirnanog> and you've reduced these two operations to one.
[15:56:05] <tirnanog> there are some downsides, though, mainly owing to bash's limited error handling. let's say a read fails. do we know whether that was on account of ENOENT or for some other reason? in bash, we can't know. there's no way to get the error number of the underlying syscall.

[17:19:19] <tirnanog> I don't recall claiming that it was race free.
[17:19:27] <tirnanog> certainly that was not implied by "this is still shit".
[17:19:38] <tirnanog> pid files are nonsense to begin with.
[17:20:42] *** Quits: kj (~kj@kj.aerisnetwork.net) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[17:20:47] <bn_work> right, so the question was about -e, ie:  I'm trying to understand if doing `[[ -e /path/to/lockfile ]]` is worse/better than `read -r pid < /run/foo/bar/RUNNING_PID`
[17:21:26] <tirnanog> a pid file isn't a lockfile.
[17:21:36] <tirnanog> so I don't know why you frame it that way.
[17:21:40] <Blondie101010> and the lockfile approach you mention seems very flaky
[17:22:05] <Blondie101010> what do you do if the lockfile is there but the process crashed?
[17:22:12] <tirnanog> irrelevant, if using flock.
[17:22:20] * Blondie101010 nods
[17:22:25] <tirnanog> if the proess crashes, the lock is released.
[17:22:33] <tirnanog> it's as simple as that.
[17:22:53] <tirnanog> whether the file exists or not doesn't even matter.
[17:23:18] <tirnanog> bn_work: framing it as -e /path/to/lockfile doesn't make sense. that's never how you would implement a lock or mutex.

[17:27:07] <tirnanog> for example, the original process could have died by the time you check, and the pid number might have been re-used.
[17:27:50] <bn_work> tirnanog:  well, presumably it was outputted by the original process during startup and if tmpfiles.d was used correctly, to a dir that only that process would have access to (or root)

[17:31:28] <tirnanog> well, I shouldn't say rely. that's just a coding error.

[17:42:22] <tirnanog> it doesn't compare at all. there is no locking.
[17:43:08] <tirnanog> it just reads the pid and, if it can do that, signals the process to see if it's alive, hoping that - collectively - this is a meaningful way of determining that the process of interest is alive.
[17:43:23] <tirnanog> pid files are not lock files. I don't know how much more clear I can be on that.

[17:49:25] <tirnanog> note that lock files don't need to be deleted where using flock. the file can exist indefinitely. it's merely a question of whether it is locked or not at any given instant.

[17:54:57] <tirnanog> the more important reason is that the script must keep the file open until such time as it exits. by opening the file first with the exec builtin, it is do.

[18:02:42] <Earnestly> tirnanog: Heh, careful with that, sometimes it creates a file called that
[18:03:12] <Earnestly> This is why I mentioned to use pgrep on process itself (with flags to be as exact as possible) in wrapper and manage stale pid file presence there
[18:03:24] <Earnestly> Rest of wrapper doesn't need to care about it

[18:42:51] <Earnestly> Celmor[m]: If more complex, make script on server, run that from forcecommand

[18:45:32] <Celmor[m]> as long as tlog gives me readable output...
[18:46:28] <Earnestly> terminal escapes can hide output, so the idea that you can just have output with those interpreted will mean you lose information
[18:47:31] <Earnestly> So you have to tolerate colour.  At least with colour escapes you can feasibly filter those out by implementing basic escape parser

[21:05:42] <Celmor[m]> Earnestly: well, couldn't it "tee" to tty and a process that filters those escapes and writes it to a file? I just see one pipe that would be needed
[21:05:57] <Earnestly> no
[21:06:06] *** Quits: furrymcgee (~devuan@cgn-213-196-210-135.nc.de) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[21:06:17] <Earnestly> Well yes, I mean of course you can just write a parser
[21:06:24] <Earnestly> Implement a terminal
[21:06:25] <Celmor[m]> | tee >(filtering) | /dev/stdout
[21:06:34] <Earnestly> "filtering" is the magical bit
[21:06:45] <Earnestly> The | /dev/stdout is meaningless
[21:06:57] <Earnestly> But now your program isn't connected to tty
[21:07:01] <Celmor[m]> sure
[21:07:18] <Celmor[m]> why wouldn't it be?
[21:07:25] <Earnestly> Because you put it in a pipe
[21:07:25] <Celmor[m]> output is passed through the pipe to the terminal and stdin is attached anyway
[21:07:43] <Celmor[m]> the output of the pipe (from tee) is printed to the console, no?
[21:07:53] <Earnestly> Yes
[21:08:14] <Celmor[m]> and control characters should be passed through as well
[21:08:24] <Earnestly> Yes
[21:08:33] <Earnestly> Depends on the process
[21:08:49] <Earnestly> It might use the fact it's in a pipe to turn them off, or change output entirely (e.g. ls and ls -1)
[21:09:14] <Earnestly> But if it produces escape sequences they will progress through the pipe unchanged
