[02:30:41] <moose> Simply something that both has a non-linear substitution and also is stateful by shifting the position in the substitution by an sbox that is dependent on the plaintext index or something.
[02:31:12] <moose> Looking for the simplest way to break it.
[02:32:16] <int-e> Why does this make me think of the Enigma device... (it has rotors which implement substitutions)
[02:32:37] <int-e> But it's probably not what you wanted :)
[02:32:38] <moose> Hm, maybe it is kind of like that. Less complex though.
[02:35:44] <paul0> yeah, I thought about enigma too

[02:41:56] <moose> They're interesting but not quite :)
[02:43:22] <paul0> moose, oh, I've read this book a long time ago, it explains substitution/transposition in classic encryption, seemed pretty closed to what you were looking for
[02:45:34] <moose> Kinda pseudocode here... but imagine you have an array with 32 elements (0-31) for rotations, you shuffle it, and you do the same with another array for substitutions that has an equal number of elements in your supported plaintext character set (63 is fine for English) and it is also shuffled. Shuffles are fisher-yates shuffles. Where i is the index in your plaintext/ciphertext (they're equal length) it will be ciphertext[i] = substitutions[(rotations[i % 32] 
[02:45:34] <moose> + characterSet.indexOf(plaintext[i])) % 63]
[02:45:43] <moose> Awful fragmented message.
[02:46:20] <moose> Hopefully the is here is clear.

[04:31:10] <rk4> somewhat of a cross post since i just asked in #chromium...but this seems as apt as it's a TLS thing...

[04:32:39] <ioxzev1z> rk4, now all that's missing is the question
[04:33:54] <rk4> i have a self signed cert for a lone https site on my lan, i want to make my browser trust it. i copied the cert.pem myself over SSH, but afaict i can only import it into chrome as a certificate authority which seems way overkill. is saying this specific cert from this specific FQDN a feature of the modern browsers? or did it get turfed by some product manager..
[04:34:12] <rk4> i feel like there's no security problem with what i'm trying to do
[04:34:40] <ioxzev1z> rk4, if you have control of the certificate then I'm not sure it matters if it's classified as a CA
[04:34:47] *** Joins: machinedgod (~machinedg@24.105.81.50)
[04:35:04] <ioxzev1z> But tbh I have no clue about certificates in chromium so might be wrong
[04:35:26] <rk4> if i import it as a CA, then i presume if someone hacks my humble https site and steals the keys, i'm presuming they could then MITM when i visit banking.com
[04:35:53] <ioxzev1z> But if you import it as a CA, you then trust all certificates created with that certificate, leaving you open to that.
[04:37:45] <rk4> i could start running my own CA where i treat the CA keys with the security they deserve...but that seems way overkill. i just want to associate a cert with a FQDN, asserting that it's OK
[04:38:20] <rk4> as much hate as gpg gets...this sort of stuff was trivial there...and i don't see why it shouldn't be so in TLS world, 
[04:38:40] <rk4> is one's only option for validating a sites cert through a CA? :<
[04:42:12] <rk4> i wonder...the openwrt crowd must run into this daily
[04:42:40] <ioxzev1z> rk4, https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/3505249?hl=en
[04:44:05] <rk4> that would seem to be adding an arbitrary cert as a CA
[04:44:58] <ioxzev1z> rk4, https://support.google.com/chrome/a/topic/6330253?hl=en only other possibly useful link I could find on certs.
[04:45:07] <ioxzev1z> You might get better help in #chromium
[04:45:26] <rk4> yeah that's where i cross posted from :<
[04:45:44] <rk4> i suspect the feature i want to use was once in browsers but removed for "safety"
[04:46:01] <MacGyver> Well, there's DANE.
[04:46:08] <MacGyver> But that's not going to help you here.
[04:49:20] <rk4> this seems a weird place we're in, where the choices are be a root CA, or lul mitm. just importing things as CAs is pretty sketchy, like if i were to do that with my openwrt install, that's precisely the thing that is both connected directly to the internet and best placed to MITM everything
[04:49:49] <MacGyver> Yes. Congratulations, you've stumbled upon one of *the* main issues with the TLS PKI.
[04:49:57] <MacGyver> And the reason DANE exists.
[04:50:10] <MacGyver> Thing is, for that to work everyone needs to use it, basically.
[04:50:41] <MacGyver> (Because it's effectively whitelisting which CAs can sign for a domain, not whitelisting which domains a CA can sign)
[04:51:30] <woggle> To mitigate importing-a-CA risk, you could potentially create a root CA, use it to sign a name constrained sub-CA, then throw away the private keys for the root CA. But the tooling for doing that is not very good.
[04:51:56] <rk4> throwing away the private keys is an interesting thought

[17:05:14] <enick_937> rk4: I'm certain that creating a root CA and using it to sign your cert is just a few lines of openssl commands. Which ones, though... :-)
[17:05:32] <enick_937> Anyway, create the root cert's private key on a thumb drive and then keep that in a closet.
