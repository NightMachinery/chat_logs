[15:50:25] <maerwald> pepeiborra: which bindist did you test?
[16:11:11] <pepeiborra> Centos7 and Darwin
[16:12:40] <pepeiborra> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/soPYmQCx/
[16:13:32] <pepeiborra> Note that text is bundled with ghc so it wouldn't be under /usr/local/lib/haskell-language-server-1.6.1.0   
[16:14:01] <pepeiborra> It should be under ~/.ghcup/ghc/8.10.7/lib/
[16:14:45] <maerwald> pepeiborra: I mean where did you download the tarball
[16:15:00] <pepeiborra> https://gitlab.haskell.org/maerwald/haskell-language-server/-/jobs/927888
[16:16:03] <maerwald> ah, it's text... that indicates the ghc detection and adjustment of LD_LIBRARY_PATH didn't work
[16:17:43] <maerwald> I guess it needs to be DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH?
[16:18:06] <pepeiborra> do you want me to test?
[16:19:19] <maerwald> /usr/local/bin/haskell-language-server-8.10.7
[16:19:32] <maerwald> at the end of the script there's LD_LIBRARY_PATH stuff
[16:19:42] <maerwald> replace that with DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
[16:20:01] <pepeiborra> that works
[16:20:18] <maerwald> ok
[16:20:25] <pepeiborra> Another q: would you expect things to work If I ghcup set ghc 9.2.1  ?
[16:20:47] <pepeiborra> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/lnEhQJxI/
[16:20:48] <maerwald> well, the bindists don't have HLS built for 9.2.1 yet
[16:20:57] <maerwald> because I wanted to reduce CI time
[16:21:12] <pepeiborra> I mean that /usr/local/bin/haskell-language-server-8.10.7 should be able to find ghc-8.10.7
[16:21:22] <pepeiborra> Even if 9.2.1 is the one in PATH
[16:21:32] <maerwald> I think HLS has never done that
[16:21:42] <maerwald> I always had to set `ghc` to the project version
[16:23:24] <maerwald> maybe the wrapper does that?
[16:24:39] <maerwald> afair that's an issue with hie-bios
[16:26:16] <maerwald> https://github.com/haskell/hie-bios/issues/194
[16:28:19] <maerwald> hm, but the wrapper script could make that work
[16:29:34] <maerwald> pepeiborra: what does `haskell-language-server-wrapper --print-libdir` report?
[16:29:55] <maerwald> the wrapper script prefers that output before trying `ghc-<ver>`
[16:31:45] <pepeiborra> "/Users/pepeiborra/.ghcup/ghc/9.2.1/lib/ghc-9.2.1/lib"
[16:32:04] <maerwald> right... so maybe we should check the version explicitly and then fall back to the other methods
[16:54:46] <maerwald> pepeiborra: does that directory even exist?
[16:54:54] <maerwald> I know it doesn't exist on linux
[16:56:13] <pepeiborra> Yes, it does
[16:56:31] <pepeiborra> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/noJrPu2E/
[16:57:15] <maerwald> what's inside the bin dir?
[17:01:46] <pepeiborra> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/dII1bmf7/
[17:02:22] <maerwald> that's severely confusing
[17:03:07] <maerwald> I guess ghc is in  /Users/pepeiborra/.ghcup/ghc/9.2.1/lib/ghc-9.2.1/bin ?
[17:04:26] <pepeiborra> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/CQWtU2iY/
[17:05:13] <pepeiborra> that's the output of `tree -I "*hi" /Users/pepeiborra/.ghcup/ghc/9.2.1/lib/ghc-9.2.1/`
[17:05:42] <maerwald> right, so the directory structure seems somewhat different to linux
[17:06:39] <pepeiborra> That's really weird
[17:08:23] <pepeiborra> it looks like there are two ghc 9.2.1 installations in that folder
[17:08:36] <pepeiborra> let me rm and reinstall
[17:12:01] <pepeiborra> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/IMpd6h3m/
[17:13:00] <maerwald> pepeiborra: ok, so the other bindists don't have that issue?
[17:14:58] <pepeiborra> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/wmDCuqjF/
[17:15:27] <maerwald> aha... so 9.2.1 changed directory layout?
[17:16:48] <maerwald> for me, the wrapper prints: /home/hasufell/.ghcup/ghc/9.2.1/lib/ghc-9.2.1
[17:16:53] <maerwald> without the trailing /lib
[17:17:25] <maerwald> I need a mac box for this type of stuff lol
[19:25:46] <wz1000> maerwald: I don't think its currently possible to get the bindir of GHC from the libdir
[19:25:59] <wz1000> hadrian and make produce different trees
[19:26:31] <maerwald> wz1000: https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/2675/files#diff-8a02da550905dfabe75e95f2779c74e69117a5dc02755ef907fb0778bd445b41R92-R103
[19:26:59] <maerwald> the problem is still the same: hie-bios prints the libdir, but not the exectuable path
[19:27:41] <wz1000> yes, and hie-bios can't in general figure out the executable path given the limitations we discussed on this channel a couple of days ago
[19:27:43] <maerwald> you can get the executable path from stack easily
[19:28:03] <maerwald> cd "$(mktemp -d)" && stack --install-ghc --resolver "ghc-${GHC_VERSION}" exec sh -- -c 'command -v ghc'
[19:28:15] <wz1000> not from cabal
[19:28:20] <maerwald> cabal just assumes whatever is in path or set in cabal.project
[19:28:23] <maerwald> even easier
[19:28:40] <wz1000> we don't want to link against cabal
[19:28:47] <wz1000> in hie-bios
[19:29:07] <wz1000> how do you get the path set in cabal.project?
[19:29:27] <maerwald> you parse cabal.project... that doesn't help you with cli flags of course
[19:30:13] <maerwald> otherwise I see no alternative to just examining ghc internal directory structure
[19:39:57] <maerwald> I think that's not so bad... HLS has a fixed set of supported GHC versions. Before releasing a new HLS version adding support for a new GHC, we can simply check the directory layout
