[00:36:29] <wedr> AsenMx, for Jira, use them sparingly. They don't disappear the moment you create one.
[00:37:47] <wedr> AsenMx, For documentation, always write down Troubleshooting sections first. Then second, write down "Setting up your dev environments". Then finally, write down everything you have learned in 2 or 3 paragraphs, with images and put them in those documentations.
[00:38:24] <wedr> AsenMx, Forget about the rest. Those pipelines your devops team uses will organically form themselves as time passes.

[03:47:21] <Thedarkb-Desktop> I'm making a level/level script editor and I'm using libtcc to compile the level logic and insert it into the game in real time.
[03:48:18] <Thedarkb-Desktop> But each level initialiser also needs to be able to see the entities.
[03:49:11] <Thedarkb-Desktop> So I'll link the entities using tcc_link_dll and with the linker as well.
[03:49:16] <vdamewood> a6a45081-2b83: What's going on can vary. Could be a firewall with some kind of layer-3 passthrough. Could be a server with multiple IP addresses. Could be a bunch of virtual machines.
[03:49:37] <Twix> a6a45081-2b83, your question is too unspecific and seems to suffer little background knowledge on your side. If some router does NAT, it usually uses only one ip address on its upstream port. For the rest of the world, all the computers hiding behind this NAT seem to be only one
[03:50:33] <a6a45081-2b83> I guess it would most probably be a server with multiple IP addresses.
[03:50:49] <a6a45081-2b83> yeah, my bad, got confused with how NAT works.
[03:50:52] <Thedarkb-Desktop> I could've exported all of the symbols to the level initialiser being developed but it would've been a lot of hassle to update that list every time I created a new entity, and maintainability trumps all else.

[07:31:54] <Jong> If the program ran on any modern operating system, only the virtual address space provided by the os can be written to.

[12:22:21] <flakonium_tubes> i suppose an ideal situation would be giving the input code it's own thread, and building a shared command stack, if not able to keep a high rate of frame

[14:42:21] <mrig> it looses the compiled phonems.
[14:43:07] <pyzozord> it's kind of unstable, but sometimes it connects the fancy F to the next letter
[14:43:11] <mrig> sorry pyzozord, I could not find an example that worked here.

[14:44:01] <pyzozord> stterm is definitely much better at rendering those than I am

[14:45:39] <pyzozord> I don't really need these that much so I haven't worked on them, but I should at some point just for completion
[14:45:40] <mrig> The issue is that the scripts that work are not monospace to, so until one of those exist it is probably best to just display an error when someone tries to

[14:47:26] <mrig> a font that is linked to the phonems and not the characters is what is really required.
[14:47:46] <mrig> doable though.
[14:48:26] <mrig> sorry pyzozord that was probably not at all helpful :|
[14:48:28] <pyzozord> Casey's refterm seems to render at least arabic properly
[14:48:53] <mrig> I'm not sure whether Arabic has a direct mapping or not, to the char.
[14:49:32] <pyzozord> as far as I understand it's a bit like sanskrit, in that it doesn't easily conform to the western monospace format
[14:49:41] <mrig> This is the essential issue with devanagari.
[14:50:05] <mrig> well the issue is with the current display system, the script is arguably far more advanced than latin.
[14:51:24] <mrig> It encodes over a 1000 different phonems that map to glyphs, with different combos of char.
[14:51:40] <mrig> I forget how many exactly but it is in that ballpark.

[15:34:47] <pyzozord> so I think actually c program ran on top of linux kernel without any user space (not even libc) might be the answer
[15:35:49] <pyzozord> actually I guess C could be replaced with a custom language - it doesn't matter, in the end it ends up a bunch of assembly
[15:36:12] <pyzozord> and linux kernel could be replaced with some better more robust, less bloated kernel if one existed
[15:37:23] <pyzozord> everything all the layers of abstraction we are pilining on the userspace are pretty bad

[15:45:27] <pyzozord> i think maybe the problem is that the concept of "identity" and "category" are just abstract constructs, they have no baring in reality
[15:45:55] <pyzozord> they are useful, but not fully precise, communication/reasoning tools
[15:47:26] <macaw> Very true. Identity and categorisations are kind of like "If it quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, then it is a duck.". Heuristics for thinking and acting.
[15:47:37] <macaw> But they don't "exist", per se.
[15:48:16] <mrig> This relates to the somewhat abstract notion of runtime; At runtime.

[15:49:16] <pyzozord> I think I heard that human body replaces all cells few times through the lifetime, and we keep referring to the same person by the same name
[15:49:48] <pyzozord> so maybe the answer is "yes, de facto people seem to think that it is still the same thing, even when all parts were replaced"
[15:50:23] <macaw> I've heard so too. (The full cycle was around 7 years?)

[17:51:10] <Rounin> mrig: Even so, though... I'm pretty sure the Amiga had better sound and graphics for a good while, and the Macintosh wasn't far behind... And the OS-specific calls needed to set that up aren't that many to begin with, at least for 2D

[17:59:08] <Rounin> a scene, that is
[18:00:07] <Rounin> Hm... Good point, though, about the timing... If we ever move off Windows completely, perhaps the next big OS should be a realtime OS
[18:00:19] <Rounin> And as usual, gaming could be a big driver of that
[18:00:30] <mrig> There is local time and wider system time, neither of which can be the same nor every really synced; I wonder how you would deal with the latency generated by the difference in the flow of time that spacetime generates?

[20:07:37] <mrig> Is there a Casey Muratori of linux systems for C programming?
[20:08:16] <mrig> That would be cool, will need to fill in the gaps, as I cant have my knowledge of c programming be fuller on windows than linux! :|
[20:08:18] <Rounin> I mean... Andrew Tanenbaum, although he was against Linux in a sense
[20:08:49] <Rounin> when it came out, I mean
[20:09:02] <mrig> I'm thinking that a minimal posix approach to start out with would be great.
[20:09:21] <mrig> oh you mean his minix system was for this?
[20:09:25] <mrig> right yes.
[20:09:42] <Rounin> Right... Which was why I came to think of Minix... Though it's not Linux exactly, obviously, and there are other minimal systems, like QNX
[20:10:04] <mrig> I was quite surprised to learn that it was his book on OS that inspired Torvalds to write linux.
[20:10:44] <macaw> Do I recall correctly that Minix's advocated the microkernel approach?

And in userspace. (Except for functionality directly playing with the kernel.)
[20:16:47] <mrig> Oh that looks cool, it is more that Casey is using the basic OS systm calls on windows which is cool. I will just have to get down and learn about those on linux, just the minimal subset initially for the game OS abstraction layer.

[20:18:49] <mrig> I must say that I'm pretty surprised by how 'at home' I fell coding at this level, it does seem to all make more sense, that could be Casey's explanations though.
[20:19:07] <Rounin> But Windows has multiple iterations too... It just keeps the old interfaces around very long
[20:19:12] <mrig> Or write an abstraction layer that can use both.
[20:19:44] <mrig> It is true that the abstraction layer for windows is so small, I'm left wondering what all the fuss was about.

[20:23:46] <Rounin> Yeah, Linux is great in one way, because you can get a compiler for anything... If you need to write something for the Megadrive or Amiga, you just get the ancient GCC that supports 68000
[20:23:53] <macaw> Personal opinion, but the documentation is a little bit better than the MDN. MDN is quite opaque and with multiple APIs to do similar stuff, or deprecated but good luck finding that.

[21:50:49] <macaw> pyzozord - did you see shadertoy? It's full of techniques people used back in the day for things like wallpapers.
[21:51:00] <macaw> nitrix - beat me to it.
[21:51:40] <nitrix> I got into SDF (signed distance functions) and the ray marching techniques they use for a while. It's really fun and simple once you get the hang of it.
[21:52:54] <nitrix> I wish our hardware wasn't so centered on rasterization, it has a lot of potential. I know the RTX cards are leading the way but I don't think they give you much control over the API.

[22:43:09] <mrig> I don't recall needing any framework to uses sessions in php, only a database something in which to store the data.
[22:43:11] <Decker> websocket just gives you session :)  Just don't close it, and its life is your session
[22:43:20] <Decker> nothing to store even

[22:43:31] <pyzozord> that was a cool video with the painiting done via mathematics

[22:43:45] <Guest61> I want to have a session variable to identify users
[22:43:55] <pyzozord> the dude said it is all "high school math", I'm not sure what kind of highschool he atended :P
[22:44:13] <Guest61> draw stuff on canvas you willdo lots of highschool math
[22:44:31] <Guest61> or make a game from scratch
[22:44:41] <Guest61> more highschool math

[22:45:31] <pyzozord> pfft, I wouldn't be surprised if rocket science was that kind of "highschool math" LO
[22:45:34] <pyzozord> :P
[22:46:01] <Guest61> rocket science involves algebra
[22:46:10] <Guest61> so it does involve highschool math
[22:46:15] <user51> Hash: psychidelic social network sounds like an ideal canditate for sensory spamming :D

[22:47:17] <pyzozord> but I have to say of "sculpting with math" is very cool
[22:47:32] <pyzozord> really does seem like a sculpting process
[22:47:48] <pyzozord> but it's for people who like math
[22:47:55] <mrig> It is often said that an A level math student is required to know more math at any one time than any other stage in the learning process.
[22:48:17] <mrig> thats age 17/18 exams in UK.
[22:48:30] <[itchyjunk]> depends on the type of rocket.
[22:48:50] <[itchyjunk]> if it's the type some countries shoot at their neighbors without caring for where it lands, sure highschool math
[22:49:07] <[itchyjunk]> if you want it to get somewhere precisely in space or even come back and land, a bit more math
