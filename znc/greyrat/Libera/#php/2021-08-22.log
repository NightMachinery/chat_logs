[12:10:38] <Albright> With the FastRoute "middlewares," is using __invoke() necessary? Isn't there a way to just call a normal method on a class (and not have to define a new class for every single route)?
[12:18:04] *** Quits: entuland (~entuland@user/entuland) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[12:18:39] <AllenJB> Your query is confusing: You talk about "middlewares" but then go on to mention "define a class for every route", which makes it sound like you actually mean controlelrs/actions/handlers
[12:20:06] <AllenJB> In the latter case, a handler is any callable. So I believe you can use 'ClassName::methodName' or [$class, "methodName"] - these are certainly options when using Slim, which AFAIK uses FastRoute (or is heavily based on it)
[12:22:24] <AllenJB> According to the last paragraph under this section in FastRoute's documentation, FastRoute doesn't even deal with dispatch - that's up to you / whatever framework you're using: https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute#user-content-defining-routes
[12:22:34] <Albright> AllenJB: I'm speaking of https://github.com/middlewares/fast-route
[12:23:03] <Albright> IIRC 'ClassName::methodName" works if the method is static.

[12:31:35] <AllenJB> I don't think that changes my answer. What your dispatcher can handle is unrelated to either FastRoute or your routing middleware. Neither nikic/fastroute or middlewares/fast-route implements the dispatcher.
[12:42:30] <Albright> You're right. I'm still trying to wrap my head around all this.
[12:43:16] <Albright> Looks like https://github.com/middlewares/request-handler is the request handler.

[13:15:18] <toretto> In websites like Wikipedia, there're few short ways for adding a link, citation, images and stuff with simpler `{{}}` or `[[ ]]` or `[[File: ... ]]` or `<ref></ref>` and so on. But how can I implement something like this? I'm not sure how this actually works.
[13:40:09] <AllenJB> It's a markup language. You'd implement a parser. In very simple cases you may be able to use regex to implement specific changes, but this tends to be error prone.
[13:41:14] <AllenJB> You'll most likely find it easiest to use an existing (popular) markup language such as MarkDown - this is easier because you/ll be able to find existing libraries to implement the vast majority of it and users are familiar with how to use the markup language.
[13:43:12] <toretto> I see. So, those markup languages are interpreted on the fly, when we request each PHP pages right?
[13:43:39] <toretto> Hmm, I'll look into MarkDown, but this operation sounds like costly.
[13:45:23] <AllenJB> That's unrelated to the markup language itself. In some cases applications will parse and render the markup language "on the fly" (this may be cached to avoid re-rendering the same content for every request). In others it will be pre-rendered to the desired output format (eg. HTML) (eg. static site builders).
[13:49:51] <toretto> I really love the "reference" generator from Wikipedia, I wish there exist some library which does that for PHP.
[13:51:56] <toretto> I can manually do that, but I was just looking for some automated way.
[13:53:20] <AllenJB> ...MediaWiki (which is the software behind Wikipedia) is written in PHP. I really wouldn't be surprised if they've split their parser out into a library
[13:54:07] <toretto> I've a copy of MediaWiki, but it's a *huge* software and I don't really find the citation or parser component separated from the core.
[14:06:07] <Albright> Markdown has extensions for citations. At the least all implementations support footnotes, which you can use in their plac.e
[14:06:45] <Albright> I use the CommonMark extension on a client site that uses Markdown extensively: https://commonmark.thephpleague.com
[14:07:06] <Albright> Along with a couple third-party extensions and a few custom ones.
[14:08:05] <Albright> We store both the Markdown and the generated HTML in the database. When visitors view pages, we just load the HTML. Much faster than regenerating it on every page load, especially since some of the pages can be quite large.
[14:10:27] <Albright> That said, it looks like the Wikipedia "wikitext" parser is available as a separate package: https://packagist.org/packages/wikimedia/parsoid
[14:11:15] <Albright> I'd encourage using Markdown instead, though. It's a pretty widespread and nearly universal standard for text markup at this point (it wasn't yet back when Wikipedia started).

[15:28:18] <arash> Hello, I want to print var_dump result in red color without using xdebug, I write this https://0bin.net/paste/yE7J2DkS#vQlzyrBH6818B+p-wOT7gR0EgMZ1VJTdQGa+GTt6BAi is there any better suggestion to do it?
[15:42:14] <da_wunder> what about using eg. https://github.com/symfony/var-dumper ?
[15:42:41] <da_wunder> and then just use `dump($somevar);` or `dd($somevar);`
[15:43:50] <novns> arash, there's no need to use <br>
[15:44:42] <novns> use margin or padding in your style
[15:45:05] <arash> da_wunder, thank you. i should look at that
[15:45:11] <arash> novns, novns, why? I need to print in new line, so i think i need it.
[15:45:39] <novns> arash, it's useless
[15:46:01] <da_wunder> arash: what novns mean is that you can make that same with inline style
[15:46:12] <arash> novns, what is useless? Its for testing purposes.
[15:46:16] <novns> yes, you are already using a style
[15:46:23] <novns> so just use it
[15:46:48] <arash> ok. i get i
[15:46:51] <arash> t
[15:46:59] <da_wunder> something like `<div style="color: red; margin:  16px 0;"><?php var_dump($somevar); ?></div>`
[15:47:12] <novns> padding in this case
[15:47:48] <da_wunder> oh, yes
