[03:43:30] <isekaijin> First of all, if the integral of f(x) over [a,b] is defined, then so is the integral of f(x) over [a,c] for any a <= c <= b.
[03:43:52] <Z-module> that's false for extended Riemann integrals, unless the function is always >= 0 or always <= 0

[03:45:14] <anovick> isekaijin: yes that is an important direction. i am investigating this claim currently
[03:46:03] <isekaijin> Second, the improper integral of f(x) over [a,infty) is the limit of the integral of f(x) over [a,b] when b -> infty.
[03:47:05] <isekaijin> So, suppose the integral of f(x) over [a,b] diverges. Then so will the integral over [a,c] for any c >= b, right?

[04:03:50] <anovick> isekaijin: Z-module: thanks to your engagement I have been motivated to find the solution. I will share it with you: if we suppose by way of contraposition that the improper integral f(x) over [a,inf) converges, then by definition the (proper) integral f(x) over any interval [a,t] converges (when a<=t) but in this case the improper integral of f(x) over [a,b] also converges, which contradicts the assumption of the claim. so we conclude the

[05:35:41] <Ethos> So x+y/ln(x+y) >=1. Then how 1/y^2 is an upper bound for (x+y) /(y*(y^2-1)*ln(x+y))?
[05:36:17] <Ethos> (that is for y >=2 and x > 1)
[05:36:45] <Ethos> We have 1/(y^2-1) <= 1/y for y >= 2 and hence  (x+y) /(y*(y^2-1)*ln(x+y)) <  (x+y) /(y^2*ln(x+y))?

[05:45:28] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[05:48:00] <PlanckWalk> Or even not large x
[05:48:12] <PlanckWalk> x = 5 suffices
[05:48:30] <PlanckWalk> What you can say is that for sufficiently large y, it holds.
[05:48:56] <PlanckWalk> I.e. for all x, there exists N such that it holds for all y > N
[05:49:34] <PlanckWalk> That's enough for showing convergence of the integral
[05:50:20] <Ethos> But why does it hold? (without looking at the graph)
[05:50:38] <Ethos> lim y->inf y/log(y) = inf uhm
[05:50:50] <PlanckWalk> It's not y/log(y)
[05:51:38] <PlanckWalk> The ratio is more like 1/log(y)
[05:51:39] <Ethos> Well since 1/y^2 is an upper bound then we should have lim y/log(y) = 1 for y->inf, shouldn't we?

[10:49:07] *** specing_ is now known as specing
[10:49:25] <zeroc00l0> Well given some "theory I'm constructing the model in", how is it that I'm able to have a set of all sets for ZFC's UoD?
[10:49:38] <zeroc00l0> Or maybe my question doesn't make sense.
[10:50:43] <int-e> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inaccessible_cardinal#Models_and_consistency
[10:52:07] <int-e> If you want a natural model (where sets are sets and element-of is element-of), then you'll need this kind of thing... where the model's universe (the class of all sets) is a set in the outer theory.
[10:53:24] <zeroc00l0> "Adding" an inaccessible cardinal to ZFC makes it capable of having a class-of-all-sets to use as the UoD for a model of ZFC?
[10:54:03] <int-e> which is a set... that's the idea, yes.
[10:54:46] *** Joins: caramel (~caramel@user/caramel)
[10:54:57] <int-e> You (hopefully) can't do it in ZFC alone because then ZFC would show its own consistency, making it inconsistent.
[10:55:08] <zeroc00l0> "which is a set", could you clarify that bit?
[10:55:42] <zeroc00l0> I see, because if there is a model of an axiom system then that axiom system is consistent.

[10:58:09] <int-e> zeroc00l0: to make a model (in the first-order logic sense), the universe of discourse has to be a set
[10:59:03] <zeroc00l0> So the class-of-all-sets is a set in ZFC w/ the inaccessible cardinal?
[10:59:51] <int-e> where the model is constructed. yes.
[11:00:27] <zeroc00l0> I don't understand what you mean by "where".
[11:01:04] <zeroc00l0> Oh, you mean the ZFC+ic.
[11:01:11] <zeroc00l0> The outer theory.
[11:01:13] <int-e> Yes
[11:01:38] <zeroc00l0> Okay, I think this makes sense, thank you.
[11:01:42] <int-e> The universe of discourse still isn't a set in the inner theory. (Thanks, Russell)
[11:02:09] <zeroc00l0> Right, but is it even possible to refer to the UoD in the inner theory?
[11:02:25] <int-e> not as a set :)
[11:02:31] <int-e> but you can quantify over it
[11:03:04] <zeroc00l0> Because refering to it as a set would lead to contradiction.
[11:03:59] <zeroc00l0> UoD is sort of like a second class citizen, you can't refer directly to it and use set-membership on it, but you get this sort of restricted access.
[11:04:19] <zeroc00l0> where first/second class citizens are terms from programming.

[11:06:16] <zeroc00l0> If the axioms restrict the size of the UOD or something.
[11:08:12] <int-e> I don't know. Russell's paradox doesn't need much: 1) the set of all sets. 2) comprehension (if X and P(x) is a set then {x in X | P(x)} is also a set). c) element-of and negation.
[11:08:42] <int-e> If you allow 1) you have to give up one of the other two, so it doesn't feel like a set theory anymore

[17:45:14] <Pollion> rsonx: Just beware, while deterministic and non deterministic finite automata have the same expressivity, and deterministic or non deterministic turing machines also (in decision version obvisouly, not for complexity), this is not the case for pushdown automata: Deterministic ones are weaker that Non deterministic.
[17:47:12] <rsonx> Pollion: yes. I thought that the non-determinism implies that the automaton could be in multiple states simultaneously.

[17:49:28] <Koen> hi Simplar
[17:49:36] <Koen> perhaps more context could help your question
[17:49:38] <Simplar> Koen: hello
[17:50:04] <Simplar> So, it's known that in a set of natural numbers, 2 is right next to 1, right?
[17:50:27] <Simplar> what is the number right next to a number which is right next to 0 in real numbers?
[17:51:15] <Klinda> there isn't you can't count them
[17:51:41] <Klinda> there is always a number you can take, just take diagonal of it
[17:51:46] <Klinda> and you didn't represent it
[17:51:59] <riv> even with rationals, any smallest number can just be halved
[17:52:08] <riv> so there is no smallest nonzero number
[17:52:24] <Koen> no smallest positive number
[17:53:48] <Koen> Simplar: imagine you have a number a, and a number b, with a < b. is b "next to" a? well, unfortunately, a < (a+b)/2 < b in that case, so it's always possible to squeeze a number between a and b
[17:53:51] <Koen> unless a = b
[17:54:32] <HisShadow> the smallest positive number is obviously 0.(0)1 /s

[21:21:50] <Z-module> Well,  [Q(b):Q] being prime, such as 3, means Q(b) has no proper subfield other than Q.

[21:22:21] <Z-module> sure
[21:22:37] <Z-module> but they're only dealing with subfields of your K = Q(2^(1/3)) here
[21:23:26] <Z-module> actually cadmio, funny thing, not elementary: If L is any subfield of C, then [C:L] being finite can only be 1 or 2.
[21:23:43] <Z-module> THis comes from C being algebraically closed.

[21:25:18] <cadmio> gandaro: it means the dimension of the field ℚ(2^(1/3)) seen as a vector space over the field Q
[21:26:52] <gandaro> thanks
[21:27:44] <Z-module> cadmio, clearly this a = 1/(1 + 2*2^(1/3))  is in your K.
[21:28:08] <cadmio> it says "since [Q(...]:Q] = 3 is prime, then Q(a) = Q(2^(1/3))"
[21:28:08] <Z-module> So the issue whether Q(a) is all of K or is just Q : there are no other possibilities.
[21:28:35] <Z-module> since [K:Q] is prime
[21:28:43] <cadmio> if it weren't prime then we could not come to the same conclusion?
[21:28:52] <cadmio> yes
[21:29:20] <Z-module> right, for example, the extensions   Q < Q(2^(1/2)) < Q(2^(1/4))   are all proper.
[21:29:37] <Z-module> and the biggest field there as degree 4 over Q
[21:29:40] <Z-module> has*
[21:31:10] <cadmio> right, since we are dealing the smallest field containig Q and "a" we must exclude there's a smaller one
[21:31:51] <gandaro> I don't want to hijack your conversation, but I wonder what's the third thing in the basis of the Q-vector space Q(2^(1/3)). Shouldn't it just be {1, 2^(1/3)}?
[21:32:16] <cadmio> yes
[21:32:33] <Z-module> There are infinitely many possible bases, but the easiest is  {1, 2^(1/2), 2^(2/3)}
[21:32:56] <Z-module> sorry, middle thing should be 2^(1/3)
[21:33:42] <Z-module> 2^(1/3) is a root of the irreducible polynomial  x^3 - 2    so all powers of 2^(1/3) up to the (3 - 1)th power are independent over Q. Otherwise that polynomial could not be irreducible.
[21:34:13] <petaflot> does 150h to compute the first 50M primes seem reasonnable?
[21:34:39] <Z-module> So if b denotes 2^(1/3), then the powers {b^0, b^1, b^2}  are independent over Q.
[21:34:45] <gandaro> petaflot: On a Raspberry Pi? On a super computer? I guess more information would be needed
[21:35:23] <petaflot> gandaro: on a single i5 core
[21:36:07] <petaflot> gandaro: @3.5GHz
[21:36:13] <CloudEvil> It does not seem very reasonable.
[21:36:25] <petaflot> CloudEvil: too fast or too slow?
[21:36:29] <CloudEvil> Given that you could seive of erathnowhates in considerably less time.
[21:36:46] <petaflot> ok
[21:37:05] <cadmio> so that's basically the Lagrange's theorem applied to field extension
[21:38:17] <Z-module> well, the formula  [K:F] = [K:L] [L:F]   for any extensions F < L K   always holds, and is quite similar the Lagrange's theorem for finite groups, but I don't think we call this Langrange.
[21:38:25] <Z-module> F < L < K     I meant
[21:38:53] <cadmio> noticing that a field is nothing more than an abelian group for + and * (the latter op without the 0) there's some parallel
[21:39:32] <Z-module> For a field extension  F < L,  the degree [L:F]  usually not the same as the index [L:F] of their respective additive groups.

[23:08:18] <alphamule> Before there was code-golfing, they had mathematical equivalent.  "How to factor this fastest!"

[23:10:00] <alphamule> This is actually an interesting thing to apply Big O analysis on?
[23:10:36] <alphamule> As originally written, it relies on a lot of tedius redoing of same work.
[23:12:38] <alphamule> Imagine a naive factoring algorithm that just loops from 1 to n, to find all integer factors of n.  Compare that to even minor optimizations.
[23:13:50] <alphamule> "Oh, just check 2 to n/2"  "Oh, just check primes"  "Oh, just check 2 to sqrt(n)" etc.
[23:14:31] <alphamule> Checking primes will give you smaller numbers to check if already prime
[23:15:20] <alphamule> Instead of checking ALL composites.
[23:16:08] <alphamule> Like:  30 gives you 2,3,5 and then you have intermediate results 15,10,6
[23:16:32] <alphamule> This method leads to parallelism
[23:16:56] <alphamule> It divides the ranges into slices.
