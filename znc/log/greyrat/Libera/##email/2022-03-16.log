[06:57:53] <sm> hey all. Back again, scratching my head over domain config & delivery problems for championwindows.biz. In the past I have always prevalied but now I'd rather pay an expert to save time. Is there anyone here interested, or anyone you'd recommend ?
[06:58:33] <thumbs> !fcrdns
[06:58:34] <dig-dug> thumbs: fcrdns: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_Confirmed_reverse_DNS : your IP address should resolve to your HELO/EHLO hostname, which in turn should resolve back to your IP. This is very important if you want big sites to accept your mail. If you can't have it from your ISP, see !relayhost
[06:58:43] <thumbs> !deliverability
[06:58:45] <dig-dug> thumbs: deliverability: (#1) If you're having problems getting your mail received by major ESPs you should first check your !fcrdns, then make sure you have SPF, DKIM and DMARC configured (see !easy_dmarc). Sign up for the dnswl at http://www.dnswl.org. Also sign up for ESP-specific programs such as feedback loops, Google postmaster tools and Microsoft's SNDS., or (#2) Check the individual postmaster pages for each ESP
[06:58:46] <dig-dug> thumbs: that you're having problems with to make sure that you're in compliance with all of their policies and if you still have problems contact the support for the ESP., or (#3) Also check to make sure you're not on any DNSRBLs and submit removal requests from any you appear on. See !multirbl.
[07:02:34] <sm> thanks. I'd rather pay an expert to save time, so I have.. $200-$500 ?... here for someone who can walk me through making these domain warnings and red flags (and ideally, resulting gmail delivery problem) go away
[07:07:42] <thumbs> sm: this isn't really a consulting channel - you'll have far better luck if you participate in the process
[07:09:21] <sm> forgive me but I am heartily sick of participating in mail server config, and would like a holiday. So, just putting it out there in case anyone here consults in this area :)
[07:09:58] <thumbs> ok, I'll let you sit it out, I'm going home either way

[09:38:53] <foo> Are you kidding me, deleting an email, taking it out of trash changes it's uid? Pretty sure that's what we're seeing.

[10:05:26] <foo> Can I reasonably assume that Message-id is the most reliable/consistent/stable email ID I can reference? 
[10:07:46] <BranchPredictor> generally no, but that depends on context
[10:08:00] <foo> BranchPredictor: what id *can* I rely on? 
[10:08:44] <BranchPredictor> foo: none, at some point you'll run into messages with *no* message-id header at all, or duplicated message-id headers with different contents
[10:09:46] <foo> BranchPredictor: are we talking about seeing that like 1% of the time? or more frequent than that? even if it's mostly reliable. We just hit an issue with trusting uid via imap. Apparently, taking an email out of trash and putting it back in the inbox changes its uid. Oversight on our part.
[10:10:17] <BranchPredictor> AFAIR IMAP UIDs are local per mailbox
[10:10:26] <BranchPredictor> (I might remeber wrong though)
[10:14:52] <BranchPredictor> in any case, message-id should work but that's not 100% reliable. messages with no meesage-id are one issue, and in case of imap, at some point you'll run into multiple messages with same message-id (just to realize that you're dealing with 2+ of the same messages, like some notification mailed directly to mailbox and then mailed again indirectly via another mailbox/redirect)
[10:15:23] <foo> BranchPredictor: aha! that makes sense. 
[10:16:03] <foo> BranchPredictor: small backstory: we're processing emails. We don't want to process the same email twice. Maybe we used a timestamp of when the mail was received at and use that as the ID? Although, 2 messages might come in the same second
[10:17:15] <foo> I'm thinking we use message-id + email received at 
[10:18:21] <BranchPredictor> in my app, to find duplicates, I use message-id (possibly re-generated if missing/invalid), date and subject
[10:18:50] <BranchPredictor> that works fairly well, but then, I'd rather have false negative than false positve
[10:19:18] <foo> BranchPredictor: really appreciate it. message-id + date + subject... I can live with that.

[16:04:37] <dob1> I have an application that 2-3 times in a month generate a pdf report for 100+ user and send and email with this report attached to every user. Could this be classified by spam by some mail servers? (I am thinking for example at the rate of msg/sent to the server)
[16:06:27] <lunaphyte> the rate would likely have little impact on that, if that's what you're asking
[16:06:34] <lunaphyte> but the answer is yes, of course
[16:09:08] <Khepra> dob1: you can reduce teh spammyness of it if you do not include HTML, no links, no images, just pure, conscise text/plain email with an optional PDF attachment. don't ever do things like .pdf.zip and similar (if PDFs are large), that's insta-junked
[16:10:30] <Khepra> There's also something about including unsubscribe X-headers, which I have recently read somewhere and would have to read up on it myself.

[18:34:01] <andr01d> IP reputation  <-- not part of any RFC 8-)
[18:35:12] <andr01d> One funny thing I've noticed, when bots try to break into the imap serivce, they only try once per IP, compared to breakin attempts on SSH, where they usually retry until blocked. Has anyone else noticed this?
[18:51:34] <rob0> why would there be RFCs about IP reputation?
[18:52:41] <Khepra> andr01d: I've noticed IPs try imap, pop3 or submission ports up to 4 times, then they give up. there's a WAG here they do so because 5 is fail2ban default in distros, so why bother :)
[18:53:02] <andr01d> Well, it seems reputation has become a central part of email delivery protocols...
[18:53:18] <rob0> I am talking about real world deliverability.  Every receiving site has their own policy.
[18:53:38] <Khepra> I have never noticed a single attempt by bots on ssh tho. I use nonstandard port. I have _lately_ (past few months) noticed probes hitting nonstanard port. which is weird because my firewall automatically blacklist you for 24 hours if you hit a "closed" port
[18:53:51] <andr01d> Khepra, that sounds similar to what I see on ssh, but the botnets that scan imap here are almost always 1 try per IP
[18:54:38] <rob0> We keep our sshd on 22, and lock them out in the firewall for brute force attempts.
[18:54:46] <Khepra> I've lately started using MaxMind to Geofence submission only to the few permitted countries. VASTLY reduced logspam.
[18:54:53] <andr01d> Sorry rob0, I'm not trying to contradict you or anything. I just have an attitude about goggle and M$ inventing their own rules of how email is delivered...
[18:55:06] <Khepra> I think they have their own rules, yes
[18:55:32] <rob0> andr01d, sure.  But Google ^^ and MS each have their own policy.
[18:55:50] <andr01d> Yes, like accepting mail and then dropping it...
[18:56:08] <Khepra> I'm also seeing much less importance on "IP reputation". We had to migrate mailservers. new IPv4 (and v6) after 10 years. the only two problems I've noticed is: 1) UCE lvl2 list (who cares tho),   2) t-online.de blocked us but a quick "pretty please" delisted within 48 hours. and we're back to normal mailing.
[19:05:53] <rob0> MS isn't as bad about discarding mail, but el Goog is awful.
[19:06:25] <rob0> And you can actually talk to MS.  Google won't ever answer you.

[22:35:08] <lagash> Hello! So I use a combination of Emacs + notmuch + afew + mbsync and am trying to get my setup working (again). So I use Yahoo and since upgrading to isync 1.4.4 it's giving me a "Error: channel yahoo: far side box Inbox cannot be opened." If I change it to INBOX it proceeds to re-download 40,000+ emails, which I'd rather not do. I'm not sure how to "list" IMAP folders - does anyone else here use Yahoo and can confirm it's INBOX not
[22:35:09] <lagash> Inbox?
