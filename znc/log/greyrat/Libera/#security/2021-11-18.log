[00:13:54] <Guest39> i have shared my phone number with one person, I did use a throwaway sim card - however for safety reasons I am thinking of binning both card and a phone
[00:14:05] <ajak> lol
[00:14:42] <Guest39> cause phone id is broadcasted via a carrier :)
[00:15:07] <MadCamel> Unless they have access to the carrier's logs(law enforcement, advanced social engineering) they're not going to get your phone's IMEI number.
[00:15:17] <Guest39> better not to take chances
[00:15:33] <Guest39> many law enforcement officers are corrupt
[00:15:41] <MadCamel> Fair enough
[00:15:48] <Paul84> don't worry about the ss that could use such backdoors, but at the criminlas that got such informations.
[00:16:10] <Guest39> which backdoors?
[00:16:43] <Paul84> guest39 not reffering to you, sorry.

[03:27:19] <piou> I think it's unfair to tell them fools and there are plenty of rich fools. There's a tradeoff. Security is always about tradeoffs, much more so than arbitrarily defending anonymity without considering what you're losing in return.

[03:56:31] <Hydragyrum> as far as boot encryption, it's a pain but a fine idea if your threat model includes anyone gaining write access to your hard drive (i.e. evil maid attack), and then you having access to boot your machine afterwards (so if your model is i.e. your computer being confiscated, stolen, etc. then it's not an issue for those)

[05:16:56] <ilikeyou> was thinking.. how many substantial "projects" must be out there with seemingly clean code that compiles into vulnerable programs deliberately. maybe they wouldn't even be held responsible, and blame the compiler. trippy. thoughts?
[05:17:15] <Hash> That's a trippy thought.
[05:17:33] <Hash> How could code 'seemingly' be clean?
[05:17:56] <Hash> I'm trying to think how someone could hide malevolent code in plain sight so even auditors can miss it.
[05:18:15] <ilikeyou> yes absolutely
[05:18:18] <Guest39> how about increasing attempts at censorship
[05:18:25] <Guest39> auditors can be bought
[05:18:46] <Guest39> govs have backdoors to most commercial products
[05:19:24] <Hash> Oh BTW, PS5 keys got discovered recently
[05:19:51] <Guest39> I think faced with increased pressure from the gov and media many decide to do very little
[05:19:52] <elf> or simply passing innocuous values to regularly used functions etc which end up causing things like overflows etc
[05:20:00] <Guest39> hence system collapsing
[05:20:08] <Guest39> elf also Xd

[05:20:58] <Guest39> yesterday I went to buy something - and it had stuff in it that should not be there :)

[05:23:00] <Hydragyrum> Hash: efistub is literally using your kernel *as* the bootloader
[05:23:12] <Hydragyrum> technically it comes with the firmware
[05:23:32] <Hash> Since Wheezy, Debian kernel contains EFI Stub support
[05:23:45] <Hash> Therefore it is possible to load the kernel directly, without any additional bootloader
[05:24:15] <q1> as init system?
[05:24:23] <Hash> no boot loader
[05:24:30] <Hash> init system is systemd mostly these days
[05:24:46] <q1> I'd give a try to dinit
[05:25:02] <Guest39> efistub sounds fun
[05:25:03] <Hash> just copy your kernels to the efi partition and add it to efibootmgr
[05:25:14] <Hash> Then boot that new entry from EFI

[06:36:09] <ajak> you don't use systemd but you're frustrated that you can't read journal files..

[06:50:15] <Hydragyrum> ajak: well the fact that nothing else works despite the working of it being completely in the kernel/pre-boot level (and therefore unrelated to systemd) means that I'm stuck with systemd or unable to boot but there's no reason to use systemd besides "the devs of <project> chose it"

[07:07:41] <ajak> really, is that suid?
[07:08:14] <ajak> seems like a privilege escalation from root to root, which isn't even really lateral :p
[07:08:32] <Hydragyrum> well, take the example of shell accounts
[07:09:03] <Hydragyrum> you give the admin (or a utility that creates these accounts) a username, and maybe a password hash

[07:13:50] *** Joins: sandipan (~Sandipan@43.252.250.69)
[07:13:59] <Hydragyrum> oh, and the only specification for usernames is that they ought to only use the portable filename character set (which does not specify not using numbers at the start), and the adduser behavior of denying it stems from an entry in /etc/adduser.conf, not from the source, but from distribution defaults

[07:14:43] <ajak> so to exploit this bug the attacker needs to have the ability to create arbitrarily named users on the system, write to a systemd service, then start that service?
[07:15:21] <ajak> and to start the service you probably need to have root anyway

[07:19:01] <Hydragyrum> a good bit of that "stupid configuration" is quite easy to do, how many people would think having a number at the start of a username would be an issue, if said person used useradd or vipw for adding users rather than adduser
[07:19:42] <Hydragyrum> but I can see I'm probably not going to convince you your systemd is bad or flawed in any way, so I'll just stop arguing with this particular brick wall
[07:20:16] <ajak> oh yeah lennart is a dick sometimes, like his aversion to musl
[07:20:38] <ajak> but it's easy to do stupid configuration, sure, but that doesn't make it systemd's fault
[07:21:21] <ajak> like making /etc/systemd world writable or something so regular users can write arbitrary services, and create arbitrary users, and start arbitrary systemd services as root

[07:21:56] <namkeles> HTran also includes a debugging condition that is useful for network defenders. In the event that a destination becomes
[07:21:56] <namkeles> unavailable, HTran generates an error message using the following format18:
[07:21:57] <namkeles> sprintf(buffer, “[SERVER]connection to %s:%d error\r\n”, host, port2);
[07:21:57] <namkeles> This error message is relayed to the connecting client in the clear. Defenders can monitor for this error message to

[16:03:05] <Guest39> Due to its focus on privacy and ease of use, Creep.im is currently getting widely abused by spammers. Which led to its inclusion in spam lists. That means that communication with other servers is limited.
[16:03:12] <Guest39> there is a workaround too :)

[22:46:49] <queue-> so for me if i zfs on arch, i dont have access to my nas, huge problem.

[22:48:32] <queue-> no you cant its widely known it cant be read
