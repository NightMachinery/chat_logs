[03:21:54] <oscurochu> i dont think lo
[03:21:55] <onosendi> oscurochu: there's nothing wrong with babel on the backend. I prefer import/export syntax. Plus, you get "use strict" for free.
[03:23:53] <gehn> modern nodejs certainly has modern JS features, so depending on which features exactly you're looking for, node likely has them already
[03:24:19] <gehn> so depending on what you want, babel may or may not be strictly required so to speak
[03:25:13] <gehn> I would wager that node itself may lag behind babel in terms of feature set
[03:25:26] <gehn> so you'd probably have "more" and "more modern" features available, even in node, if you use babel
[03:26:14] <silly> also, there's stage 3 proposals

[03:47:56] <z1haze> things till use gulp?

[03:48:05] <bobdobbs> gulp works.
[03:48:13] <z1haze> perl works
[03:48:16] <jaawerth> and npm scripts don't?

[03:49:17] <jaawerth> i see
[03:49:19] <z1haze> then learn them
[03:49:22] <bobdobbs> in the meantime, I have gulp tooling that works.
[03:49:25] <z1haze> gulp is antiquated
[03:49:37] <ljharb> bobdobbs: babel works by itself. you don't need gulp for it at all, or webpack

[03:49:43] <bobdobbs> z1haze: eventually, sure I'll pick up npm scripts. But at the moment, I'd rather use something that gets teh job done
[03:49:45] <ljharb> bobdobbs: gulp does not work well
[03:49:54] <ljharb> bobdobbs: it's why the entire JS ecosystem abandoned it half a decade ago

[03:51:50] <bobdobbs> z1haze: I spent two days trying to get basic stuff done in webpack. I had trouble understanding the docs and I couldn't get the support I needed.
[03:52:14] <oscurochu> bobdobbs you say you want to upgrade your tooling but in order to do that you need to put all of your old stuff away. all of it. start brand new. once you do that, then figure out how to piece the new stuff into the old stuff. dont try and make old stuff work with new stuff without understanding the new stuff.
[03:52:16] <bobdobbs> z1haze: that's partly why I came to my current conclusion: everyone has a favourite toolchain. That's fine.
[03:52:42] <oscurochu> try 3-4 different toolchains.
[03:52:48] <bobdobbs> oscurochu: I tried that over the last two days with webpack. I couldn't even figure out the basics.
[03:52:53] <z1haze> i'll give you that, webpack is not _easy_ to learn, but once you get it, you get it
[03:52:55] <oscurochu> thats just one toolchange
[03:53:01] <oscurochu> toolchain*
[03:53:41] <z1haze> webpack, as sucky as it can be in some aspects, has a plugin for just about everything you could ever want to do
[03:53:44] <oscurochu> try 2 or 3 more toolchains.
[03:53:45] <bobdobbs> z1haze: it's worse than not easy.

[03:56:48] <bobdobbs> well, that sounds reasonable. But after two days of struggling with webpack, my impression is that it the configuration process is so esoteric that it has the same problem.
[03:57:04] <oscurochu> what are the benefits of understanding webpack vs just using a script that sets up webpack for you?
[03:57:16] <banana_> ljharb yo
[03:57:46] <bobdobbs> oscurochu: being able to understand the underlying tool well enough that you can fix things when they break.
[03:58:04] <banana_> so when you have a function that does an ajax call. you can test it by stub through one of the function parameters?
[03:58:16] <banana_> *by stubbing it

[03:59:55] <oscurochu> matsaman are you calling webpack antiquated?
[04:00:02] <bobdobbs> oscurochu: tbf, I have tried other tooling that layers on top of webpack. I looked reasonably thoroughly at Laravel Mix. But I had two issues there: I just don't think that the documentation is sufficient. And not enough people use it... so if I get stuck I can't ask for help

[09:02:45] <bobdobbs> by 'test', I mean see how it responds to being run under certain conditions, including direclty.
[09:03:08] <bobdobbs> KevinX: I mean, ultimately this is for an npm script anyway. So it *has* to be run directly
[09:03:22] <KevinX> You only run commands that look like `npm run dev`
[09:03:30] <bobdobbs> systemfault: a few ways:
[09:03:33] <KevinX> then in package.json you add the dev script
[09:03:50] <KevinX> and in that devs cript, you write the commands from the library's documentation
[09:03:53] <systemfault> bobdobbs: There are two ways for a local install that I'm aware of... so...
[09:03:55] <bobdobbs> systemfault:' ./node_modules/sass/bin/sass.dart'
[09:04:03] <KevinX> in this case, you add "dev" "sass <input.scss> [output.css]"

[09:11:42] <bobdobbs> oh, that was my stab at installing dart-sass from github
[09:11:48] <systemfault> bobdobbs: You should have "sass": "^1.48.0"
[09:12:03] <corwin> oh wow! me too.  I've been using emacs decades but only started learning elisp a couple years ago.  One day it just "clicked".
[09:12:19] <bobdobbs> k. I'll make that change.... but I had trouble getting anything newer than 1.25.something

[09:18:28] <bobdobbs> corwin: (if you can see this) I don't think I've ignored anyone before on irc. Not for at least 15 years or so.

[09:18:45] <corwin> bobdobbs: I can see it lol
[09:18:59] <bobdobbs> corwin: oh no!
[09:20:05] <corwin> in ERC we can use text properties to make text invisible so my mod just makes messages of certain types (per channel) invisable, and then lets me toggle which are currently considered boring.  I've thought about extending that to ignore but.. I don't /ignore very often.
[09:20:33] <bobdobbs> corwin: erc is the best. It's great being able to move around the buffer, cutpaste and switch between channels the emacs way
[09:21:16] <corwin> bobdobbs: I'm most active the emacs related channels.  in those it's very handly to be able to C-x C-e and eval some code someone's put in channel.

[14:30:08] <aiena> `s = s.replace(/\s+(?=\s+)/g,'');` when I use this regex it replaces more than one space with a space. But I dont understand how it works why it should replace with nothing ''. Also this fails with a string like test\t\ttest. which I want to become "test test"

[14:31:08] <mccrazy> I've got a page full of videos and want to make a player that loops through them when I hit the d key.
[14:31:11] <mccrazy> I can't find a single way to just say what I want, which is "links = document.querySelectorAll('.videoLink'); window.addEventListener('keydown',function() { player.src=links.next() }"
[14:31:14] <mccrazy> despite the claim that arrays do indeed provide next(), calling Array.from(links) doesn't lead to getting next()
[14:31:17] <mccrazy> making another temp variable to loop seems foolish, as well
[14:32:49] <mccrazy> aiena: you're replacing more than one space, including the first space, with nothing.
[14:33:16] <mccrazy> if you want it to be replaced with just one space, then pass ' ' as the second argument.

[14:35:29] <Kabouik> Hey #JS. I am new to Javascript and really don't know anything about it, but I'd need to use a code chunk to alter Leaflet map clusters. The code is here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/60525137/13186359
[14:35:44] <Kabouik> Unfortunately, when there are many samples, clusters are cropped and look like squares: https://0x0.st/o-WF.png
[14:35:51] <Kabouik> Any pointer on what I need to change to avoid that?
[14:36:43] <aiena> mccrazy, it sory of makes sense if I use regex101.com but that site has limitations.
[14:36:59] <mccrazy> also, does it need to be /g?

[14:37:43] <mccrazy> specifically, why group the second bit anyway?
[14:37:55] <mccrazy> if you always want it to be a space, that is.
[14:38:12] <mccrazy> don't you just want it to be \s+?
[14:39:55] <mccrazy> should work just fine to do s.replace(/\s+/,' ')
[14:40:51] <mccrazy> maybe you want something slimmer, like \s+{2,}
[14:40:56] <mccrazy> but i can't recall if regexp does that in js

[20:03:00] <EdFletcher> banana_: it just depends, at work we use `jest` mostly, with `sinon` thrown in for spies and some mocking and `nock` for http mocking. personal projects i usually just reach for `tape` instead of `jest` because it's simpler.
[20:03:04] <cthulchu> it's so annoying
[20:03:25] <cthulchu> jobs that I applied back in November are popping up now. WTF with all the HR people?
[20:03:47] <banana_> EdFletcher: thanks I'm gonna try and use sinonJS
[20:04:36] <EdFletcher> banana_: good stuff, it's quite full-featured so it should serve you well
[20:04:55] <banana_> hope so definitely want to use functions for everything
[20:05:08] <banana_> but yeah mocking module is something new
[20:05:41] <banana_> good to know now don't have to pass the thing I want to mock through every functions parameter

[23:20:41] *** Joins: wildo (~lain6141@119.224.72.222)
[23:24:34] <Stanley> https://kopy.io/GMz2K
[23:24:51] <matsaman> probably it's a really bloated POS giant overcomplex library
[23:25:03] <Stanley> here's my app.js that gets compiled with webpack, the onpage script tag I use to initialize and reload the gallery, and then the error itself
[23:25:08] <matsaman> bootstrap? Enough said
[23:25:27] <Stanley> not bootstrap the framework, that's just to bootstrap the app

[23:26:06] <Stanley> matsaman this is the bootstrap file that's required https://kopy.io/FUxpX
[23:26:20] <Stanley> it's just the default in laravel

[23:27:27] <Stanley> So it keeps saying that "this.settings" is undefined and I have no clue how to figure out what or why

[23:28:07] <Stanley> I don't really know what I'm doing but if I click around I can find a file that says
[23:28:07] <Stanley> declare function lightGallery(el: HTMLElement, options?: LightGallerySettings): LightGallery;
[23:28:07] <matsaman> laravel, interesting

[23:28:41] <matsaman> Stanley: so either 'this' is undefined or it has not attribute 'settings'
[23:28:43] <Stanley> so the second parameter I'm passing in are settings, but it's also supposed to have it's own defaults, the ones you pass in are only overriding stuff
[23:28:52] <matsaman> Stanley: console.log(typeof this)
[23:28:58] <Stanley> where do I put that?
[23:29:04] <matsaman> good question =)
[23:29:45] <Stanley> that's all plugin code which is imported through NPM so I can't really modify it, that would imply the plugin is broken ?
[23:29:54] <matsaman> it should say the line number where it's complaining about 'this.settings', add it around that line
[23:30:19] <Donitz> can you check if the browser tab is currently in focus?
[23:30:22] <Donitz> or visible

[23:37:49] <Stanley> matsaman yeah but that's inside the libraries code
[23:37:55] <Stanley> hm
[23:39:32] <matsaman> well you can assume the library is fine if you want, and that the code being passed to it has become broken
[23:39:42] <matsaman> I'd rather understand it from all angles
[23:39:45] <Stanley> Yeah
