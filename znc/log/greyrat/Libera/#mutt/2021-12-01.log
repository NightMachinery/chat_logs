[22:24:38] <pmn> is there a way to set imap flags on a message, `\Deleted` in particular from mutt without removing the file from filesystem?
[22:25:29] <pmn> ... and without managing imap (i use isync)
[22:26:04] <pmn> i've tried <delete-message> <set-flag>D but no luck
[22:38:55] <Betawolf> there is a $delete option that if you set to 'no' I think should mean messages aren't actually deleted
[22:45:06] <rav_> the GPG signature check worked when the e-mail was both encrypted and signed, but not when just signed
[22:47:17] <pmn> Betawolf: that would disable everything!
[22:47:55] <pmn> mutt actually does sync to maildir, say for N to O (taking out 'S' from msg file name on the filesystem)
[22:48:05] <pmn> *from N to O
[22:49:19] <Betawolf> pmn: you want to do this selectively? I think you you could set the option, sync and unset the option.
[22:51:38] <pmn> if $delete is set to yes (or ask-yes etc) then <{purge-delete}-message> removes the message from filesystem, that causes isync to miss the boat, if you like, and not sync '\Deleted' message to the imap server
[22:52:41] <pmn> i ideally, i would like mutt to mark[1] the message as '\Deleted' and leave the rest to isync. [1] mark as in the sense renaming the message file on maildir
[22:53:58] <Betawolf> and setting delete to 'no' means mutt doesn't mark the file in maildir? I've never tried this.
[22:56:26] <pmn> Betawolf: $delete = no turns all those <{purge-delete}-{msg-threead}> to noop
[22:57:21] <pmn> well except in the menu you see a 'D' on the entry but switching back-and-forth the folders will clear that
[22:57:37] <Betawolf> Huh, that's not what I expected from the manual's description.
[22:57:59] <pmn> i also have `watch -- ag --file-with-matches regex` and i can see that nothing changes on the "deleted" msg
[22:58:39] <pmn> with N/O change of flags i see that file name changes (S, seen, is appended to the filename and removed)
[22:59:55] <pmn> i'm looking into mutt_set_flag_update(), if anyone has a clue please let me know
[23:01:34] <pmn> does $delete=no sets the m->readonly to true in `struct Mailbox *m`?
