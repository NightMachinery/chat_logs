[11:57:35] <zagura> And, still ipv6 seems to be a problem for numerous applications and networks :/

[12:00:14] <bagder> it'll happen any year now!

[13:08:16] <Piru> is the "maximum" highest total kept at one point or amount of allocated/freed during processing?
[13:08:26] <bagder> its the high water mark
[13:08:30] <Piru> right
[13:08:37] <Piru> both are interesting
[13:08:50] <bagder> indeed
[13:08:53] <Piru> when you think about low end system with some fragmentation
[13:09:32] <Piru> not everything is a full-blown system with process + heap that magically appears and goes away every time app is ran
[13:10:12] <Piru> there are some systems where memory is actually quite finite resource and you might not be able to allocate large blocks after some time
[13:10:47] <jfuller> bagder++ for reducing the mallocs
[13:10:54] <Piru> not ot mention that some applications might run for a very long time, leading to framentation of the heap
[13:11:01] <Piru> not to*
[13:11:18] <Piru> so nice development in this regard indeed!
[13:15:02] <Piru> I'd maybe try some other site than google.com for testing however. it might change wildly depending on number of things
[13:16:19] <Piru> google is so big they might even offer wildly different certs or the index from different parts of tre world etc :P

[13:17:07] <bagder> lame network support in those things =)

[13:17:22] <GodEater> bagder: haha, v. true ;)
[13:17:35] <bagder> Piru: true, but I picked google simply because they happen to have a rather large set of SAN names
[13:17:38] <Piru> round-robin*
[13:17:40] <GodEater> gevaerts should have got around to implement a network stack over usb when he started the usb work!
[13:18:29] <Piru> bagder: ah yes. makes sense, as it's one of the worse offenders for the malloc spamming the commit fixed
[13:18:38] <bagder> yeah
[13:18:44] <bagder> and yet a "normal" site people access
[13:18:57] <bagder> I mean not a special weirdo.badssl.com one
[13:19:20] <Piru> I think some CDN certs are similar
[13:19:27] <bagder> yes, its not unusual
[13:19:29] <Piru> like hundreds of names
[13:19:39] <bagder> curl.se used to have that too initially
[13:19:50] <Piru> wildcard now?
[13:19:50] <bagder> before fastly redid their architecture
[13:20:00] <bagder> yes, a single one
[13:20:05] <Piru> yeah
[13:20:28] <Piru> lets encrypt indeed advanced things a lot in certificate world
[13:20:49] <Piru> maybe not always directly but putting pressure to others to get their shit together too.
[13:21:10] <bagder> totally
[13:21:27] <Piru> everyone gets a wildcard cert! </oprah>

[13:25:19] <bagder> Total allocated: 458601
