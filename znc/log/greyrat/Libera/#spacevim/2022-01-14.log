[18:26:47] <SpaceVimBot> <koolcast> Hi all, anyone here using spacevim and rust?
[18:34:08] <SpaceVimBot> <Diego Leonardo Alfonso Avilan> Hello all, i'm pretty new with vim/SpaceVime i am trying to configure SpaceVim to work with go(golang) but i got the error `[deoplete] gocode binary not found.  Use :messages / see above for error details.` https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim/issues/3389 is a proposed solution to solve it and use `gopsl`  instead of `gocode`but i dont  know how to implement it, can any one help me with that! Thanks
[20:07:28] <SpaceVimBot> <Macurrent> How is this pylint suppose to work in space vim? In vscode, the error was being detected automatically even without me having to save the file, in space vim, i have to save the file is when i see the error message
[20:07:30] <SpaceVimBot> <Macurrent> In Space vim, after saving and before saving. In vscodium, i did not save and the error was seen immediately. Sorry for using maize as a fruit : http://img.vim-china.org/download/d55dcf93/file_7410.jpg

[20:09:32] <SpaceVimBot> <Macurrent> In Space vim, after saving and before saving. In vscodium, i did not save and the error was seen immediately. Sorry for using maize as a fruit. Is there a way to make spacevim also show those errors even without saving the file like vscode does? : http://img.vim-china.org/download/d55dcf93/file_7410.jpg
[21:23:14] <SpaceVimBot> <Macurrent> Any help here guys, why is pylint not working for me? (re @Macurrent: )
