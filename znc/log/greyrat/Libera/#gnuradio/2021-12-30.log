[00:03:43] <patchvonbraun[m]> The preferred drive is the soapysdr driver.  The unfortunate thing about LIME is that there were 3 different ways of driving it, which produce no small amount of confusion.
[00:04:18] <level420> Ah I see, it does seem confusing.
[00:05:50] <level420> Are there binaries available for it or do you have to build it yourself?
[00:06:44] <patchvonbraun[m]> I run Ubuntu 21.10,and just used all the packaged stuff.  GnuRadio, gr-osmosdr, soapysdr, LimeSuite, a few other things.
[00:08:31] <level420> ah
[00:08:49] <level420> I'm on arch atm, it seems that there are no prepackaged binaries available, oh well

[00:50:10] <level420> So it seems that I can't compile gr-soapy or gr-limesdr due to them both only supporting up to gnuradio 3.9, is there a module that works for limesdr that does support up to 3.9?
[00:50:26] <level420> *They only support up to 3.8, not 3.9
[00:50:54] <level420> It's practically impossible for me to downgrade due to dependency issues that I can't seem to fix
[00:55:24] <willcode4[m]> gr-soapy is built in to v3.9, as long as it was enabled at build time.

[03:50:54] <muaddib[m]> <tetrakist> "What is the general feeling/..." <- I used one about a year ago. Put it on an UP2 board. I got it to work with gnuradio using their fork of gr-OsmoSDR which is significantly old. Haven’t checked it out recently. 
[03:50:54] <muaddib[m]> Overall it wasn’t reliable, there were a lot of bugs. Sometimes you had to power down the whole board to get it to come back up.  There are also several board revisions which makes things confusing.
[03:50:55] <muaddib[m]> Again, I haven’t looked at it in a while but when I did use it they still seemed to be actively maintaining/getting it to work.

[16:49:48] <tnt> the vendor should really take care of that
[16:50:19] <Hoernchen> the problem is that i only have a preproduction xtrx with slightly different hardware so I can't really do it, I don't have the schematics, and the git history was unfortunately squashed, so I can't look at what's changed either to make it work with my version
[16:51:11] <tnt> Hoernchen: oh you have a v3 too ?
[16:51:24] <Hoernchen> i have a a v0 zero beta with hand-soldered usb wires..
[16:51:29] <Hoernchen> yes, wires.
[16:51:44] <tnt> USB ?
[16:52:00] <Hoernchen> yeah, the beta usb board
[16:52:14] <tnt> right, but the xtrx itself, what rev ?
[16:52:22] <Hoernchen> let's see..
[16:54:15] <Hoernchen> yes, 3
[16:55:26] <tnt> I have the same, which is why it was nice that _florent_ started on litex for that board, because it'll probably be easier to add support for it there than the offical code.
[16:56:03] <Hoernchen> well.. wothout hte git history I don't know what's different :(
[16:56:18] <tnt> I have the schematics of rev3.
[16:56:45] <Hoernchen> so.. what's different :p
[16:57:17] <tnt> Not much, really just a couple of details regarding the Vio of the LMS.
[16:57:57] <tnt> (I don't have rev4 schematics so I can't compare ... just check vs what florent reveng'd)
[17:04:01] <Hoernchen> i'm a bit reluctant to just "give things a try" tbh
[17:14:19] <Crofton> So many things to try

[17:22:03] <Crofton> intro
[17:22:58] <funkylab[m]> Crofton:  just for the hypothetics of it, assume there was a python-heavy framework that you could use to plug together something as complicated as a Linux distro from parts, and in the end it actually builds
[17:23:44] <funkylab[m]> Crofton: that, but for the design of SoCs, minus the mega manual
[17:23:50] <Crofton> lol
[17:24:00] <Crofton> can you run linux on the socs"
[17:24:14] <tnt> yeah ... but you really shouldn't.
[17:24:16] <funkylab[m]> if you design a SoC that has a CPU that does, yes.
[17:24:31] <Crofton> zephyr?
[17:24:43] <tnt> way more appropriate.
[17:24:45] <Crofton> or jsut a while loop :)
[17:26:50] <funkylab[m]> Crofton:  there's RISC-V, lattice mico32, open risc to choose from
[17:27:00] <funkylab[m]> one of them will probably do your while loop
[17:28:24] <funkylab[m]> tnt: your RV32 experiments for E1/USB were plain picorv with your own WB-alike bus, right?
[17:28:41] <funkylab[m]> "experiment" might not be enough of a statement of how awesome that was :)
[17:29:34] <tnt> funkylab[m]: yes.
[17:30:46] <tnt> litex is convenient, but ... that comes with overhead. On a ice40 or even ecp5, I don't want to pay that overhead.   On an Ultrascale Plus, sure I have plenty of resources to spare.
[17:31:18] <Crofton> I have a zcu104, I am thinking of trying something there
[17:31:58] <tnt> I wish litex had support for the PS of the Zynq, but I don't think it has ATM.
[17:33:13] <Crofton> but you can put a cpu in the PL and interact somewhow with PS?
[17:33:38] <tnt> no, I don't think there is any PS support.
[17:34:10] <tnt> I mean, you can do it, but I don't think litex has anything to help you.
[17:34:39] <tnt> you'll have to setup all the PS yourself and instanciate it as a blackbox. But ask in #litex, I might be mistaken as to what level of support they have.
[17:34:55] <Crofton> sure, next years project :)

[21:05:45] <cpfig[m]> Hello, I have a question about the use of Embedded Python Blocks
[21:07:03] <cpfig[m]> I'm trying to create a counter which resets after counting to five. I could use a IIR filter for part of this, except for the resetting. How can I access a previous output in the python code? I've been seeing some bugs in my attempts.
[21:07:49] <cpfig[m]> probably because the data is passed in chunks of a certain size and I cannot access the previous output at the start of these chunks
[21:10:47] <bpadalino> if you don't care what the input is, then why not just store it as a member of your class and just use that ?
[21:10:56] <bpadalino> if you care about the input, then you want history
[21:11:40] <cpfig[m]> yes I care about the input, for example I would like output[i] = output[i-1] + input[i]
[21:12:09] <cpfig[m]> bpadalino: how could I implement this history. Sorry if it is a begginer question
[21:21:34] <cpfig[m]> Thanks, I searched online and I found the self.set_history( ) to save previous inputs

[21:24:20] <cpfig[m]> Going back to code, thanks for the attention.
