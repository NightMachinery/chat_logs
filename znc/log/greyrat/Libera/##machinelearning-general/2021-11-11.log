[00:50:01] <Klinda> hello which is the best method for feature extraction if you have a string?
[00:50:05] <Klinda> bag of words?
[00:52:25] <mefistofeles> hmm, I don't think there is a "best" method
[00:52:39] <mefistofeles> depends on what you are aiming for, I guess... but I'm really far from being knowledgeable in NLP
[00:52:42] <mefistofeles> :P
[00:53:31] <HuntsMan> there is no "best method"
[00:53:59] <Klinda> well I have two feature, one feature represent a string, the second one it's a string, I should find if it's a bug or not the translate to string1 to string2 so 0/1
[00:54:13] <Klinda> the*
[00:55:56] <mefistofeles> Klinda: sounds like xyproblem, maybe you want to post the original question/problem you have?
[00:56:28] <Klinda> also why there is a hint saying that I should consider the first feature and the second feature together, and the extract the features?
[00:56:37] <Klinda> then*
[00:57:21] <[itchyjunk]> transformers?
[01:02:17] <Klinda> also I can't even open the csv file lmao

[01:06:19] <mefistofeles> does it have headers and lines without values?
[01:06:44] <coraxx> Klinda: is the file to big to open in a simplke text editor, so you can analyze the contents (structure) ?
[01:07:28] <Klinda> it has 100k samples I think

[01:08:33] <[itchyjunk]> that sounds openable for inspection, no?

[20:15:58] <Klinda> hello, normally you would create training, validation and test set before feature extraction or after?
[20:16:56] <mefistofeles> Klinda: it is kind of iterative, you surely do some feature engineering beforehand
[20:17:22] <mefistofeles> but also after you get some estimation/model, depending on results
[20:18:03] <Klinda> now I applied the bag of word on all the dataset
[20:18:18] <Klinda> should I do that for each set or not
[20:18:24] <Klinda> instead
[20:18:33] <Klinda> ?
[20:21:00] <mefistofeles> Klinda: in practice you extract features after applying bag of words, but that doesn't mean you cannot do it differently, of course
[20:21:56] <mefistofeles> consider that using bag of words already drops information, so depends on your problem is this information is relevant or not... for example if you want to know something about grammar then doing bag of words is probably not a good idea
[20:26:55] <Klinda> All I know is that usually 80% is used for training, 10% for validiting and 10% of testing set. if I apply bag of word for each set, maybe I have feature vectors that have not the same length, so probably first I have to run it to the all dataset, and then divide in 3 set?
[20:28:01] *** Quits: [itchyjunk] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[20:28:09] <Klinda> or am I thinking wrong?
[20:28:34] <Klinda> maybe I can use the bag of word fit on the trainng set, and then trasform on validating and test set?
[20:31:38] <Klinda> it's correct to use the bag of word in this cause because you have to see if that text is a bug or not
[20:32:04] <Klinda> so it's the same as seeing if it's a spam or not
[20:36:40] <mefistofeles> if you are using it for feature extraction, then I'd say you do it before separating into sets, yes
[20:36:58] <mefistofeles> because in that way you can spot if your sets are balanced/unbalanced and things like that
[20:37:17] <Klinda> the dataset it's balanced
[20:37:33] <mefistofeles> how do you know that?
[20:37:43] <Klinda> the teacher said it
[20:38:31] <Klinda> he did public_datset['bug'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar')
[20:38:47] <mefistofeles> ok... I guess we would need more details on your actual problem
[20:39:43] <Klinda> I just have a text and a y label saying it's bug or not
[20:40:13] <mefistofeles> ok
[20:40:21] <Klinda> I just want to know if I have to fit the bag of word on the training set, and then trasform it in validate and test set
[20:41:10] <Klinda> so in the end first I use tha bag of word in the training set, and then you apply the model on validate and test set
[20:41:42] <Klinda> I don't know what it changes by doing this vs using all the dataset without dividing, for exampòe

[20:42:17] <mefistofeles> again, if you are using it for extracting features then it doesn't really matter
[20:42:19] *** Joins: SigmoidFroid (~SigmoidFr@ns508678.ip-192-99-15.net)
[20:43:05] <Klinda> but is always a good practice on doing the fit on the model and then trasform the valdate and testing set?
[20:43:19] <mefistofeles> that is, if you are already dividing your sets without any information from the bag of words (which is the common case)
[20:43:35] <mefistofeles> in that case it doesn't matter because, well, your set division doesn't have anything to do with the bag of words
[20:43:46] <mefistofeles> and I'd think that's the common approach
[20:44:31] <mefistofeles> Klinda: again, if  you are using it for feature extractiong, you have to extract the same feature in the other sets, of course... or else how would you apply the model?
[20:45:14] <mefistofeles> *extraction
[20:45:30] <Klinda> what is the general things to do? first divide the dataset in each set, do the feature extraction on the training set and trasform the validate and testing set?
[20:45:52] <Klinda> is a common practice ?
[20:45:57] <mefistofeles> yes
[20:46:14] <mefistofeles> that's the common approach
[20:46:23] <Klinda> but in the end also it's the same thing as doing the feature extraction on all the dataset, in my case
[20:46:50] <mefistofeles> it's weird that you say "transform the validate and testing set", but I guess you just mean extract the fetures of those sets to apply your model, right?
[20:47:36] <Klinda> yes
[20:47:44] <Klinda> it's the python keyword to say that
[20:47:45] <Klinda> I think
[20:48:44] <Klinda> you use the fit on the training set and then you apply the model (transform) to the validate and testing set
[20:52:33] <mefistofeles> ok
