[00:00:31] <geekosaur> it also includes things like compile options that can change generated object code or inlineable source in the .hi file, since that also produces binary incompatibility between builds
[00:00:39] <hololeap> I'm running into something where it changes depending on whether or not --enable-tests is turned on
[00:01:13] <geekosaur> @where paste
[00:01:13] <lambdabot> Help us help you: please paste full code, input and/or output at e.g. https://paste.tomsmeding.com
[00:01:18] <geekosaur> show your cabal file?
[00:01:41] <geekosaur> (and/or stack.yaml if applicable)
[00:02:15] <hololeap> so in gentoo, all the dependency resolution is through the package manager. sometimes you get circular dependencies with the tests and the only way to break them is to compile a package with tests off, finish compiling the other packages, then go back and turn tests on for the first package if you want
[00:02:30] <EvanR> this is funny, type F a = G X a  won't let me use F unapplied but type F = G X will
[00:02:30] *** Joins: whatsupdoc (uid509081@id-509081.hampstead.irccloud.com)
[00:02:40] <hololeap> this changes that ABI hash, and so you then have to recompile the reverse-dependencies of that package
[00:03:28] <geekosaur> that implies the tests do something like "ghc-options: -O0" or some other flag that affects the shared library ABI
[00:03:33] *** Joins: werneta (~werneta@70-142-214-115.lightspeed.irvnca.sbcglobal.net)
[00:03:52] <hololeap> I'll look into it, but I think the only difference is --enable-tests or not
[00:04:25] <geekosaur> although sometimes cabal flips a flag that it thinks won't affect the ABI but does (use -v3 during the build, then ask in #hackage)
[00:04:48] <hololeap> so yeah, I'd like to figure out how to toggle tests and keep that ABI hash from changing. anyway, thanks for telling me the name of it
[00:05:06] <geekosaur> this is I think still shaking down because ghc has a ridiculous number of options and figuring out which ones affect shlib ABI is painful

[00:05:59] <geekosaur> also sometimes ghc thinks one flag affects ABI when it doesn't, and hashes it inappropriately. but --enable-tests is not passed to ghc as such
[00:06:44] <geekosaur> so cabal is changing some option, which is why you need to compare cabal -v3 output to see what ghc-passed flags change with --enable-tests
[00:07:10] <hololeap> ok

[01:47:13] <monochrom> "not" looks intuitive because the complement of a regular language is still a regular language, and the complement of a decidable language is still a decidable language.

[05:38:39] <EvanR> when you use / on literals they default to Double
[05:38:48] <EvanR> you can't use it on Ints

[05:39:19] <lambdabot>  1
[05:40:15] <ozzloy> so length gives back an integer, and '/' doesn't work on integers

[05:40:46] <EvanR> unless you convert them to float first
[05:40:47] <ozzloy> i feel like it would be clearer if 2 / 2 also gave a type error
[05:40:57] <EvanR> heh
[05:41:29] <ozzloy> because as it stands, length [1,2] -> 2, and 2 / 2 works, but length [1,2] / 2 doesn't
[05:41:35] <EvanR> it's funny defaulting rules are probably there so beginners aren't so frustrated?

[05:42:02] <EvanR> trying stuff on the terminal like we are doing xD
[05:42:21] <ozzloy> it sure looks like substitution doesn't work in this instance, you can't replace an expression with something that reduces to it
[05:42:37] <EvanR> it doesn't work, until you remember that numeric literals have additional magic
[05:42:42] <ozzloy> go hard, or go home
[05:42:44] <EvanR> 2 isn't just 2
[05:42:58] <EvanR> it's a polymorphic value that depends on the results of type inference / checking
[05:43:07] <ozzloy> if you're going to go hard on types, go all the way
[05:43:12] <EvanR> :t 2
[05:43:13] <lambdabot> Num p => p
[05:43:30] <EvanR> so when you use it with /, it's not obviously a type error 
[05:43:37] <EvanR> it depends on p
[05:43:59] <ozzloy> > div 3 2
[05:44:00] <EvanR> when you use it with length [1,2] :: Int, definitely a type error

[05:51:55] <EvanR> ozzloy, you're going to hate this extension that lets you use "string literals" in the same way as number literals, they can be interpreted by a type class to become whatever value xD
[05:52:28] <EvanR> can be handy, and abuse xD
[05:52:34] <EvanR> d
[05:52:45] <ozzloy> heh

[05:53:04] <ozzloy> i am impressed and horrified
[05:54:57] <ozzloy> makes me think of #define i (rand() % i) from c
[05:55:00] <dsal> The list can lead to excitement.
[05:55:34] <ozzloy> that'll teach you to use single letter variables for iteration

[05:56:53] <ozzloy> so, ok, it's implemented in a principled way
[05:57:13] <ozzloy> it's not a special hack for integers to sometimes be autoconverted to doubles
[05:58:17] <boxscape_> yeah implicit conversions aren't a thing in Haskell
[05:58:26] <dsal> No, you generally know what type you're dealing with.
[05:58:54] <ozzloy> well, maybe not me specifically, but someone well versed enough
[05:59:16] <EvanR> if you don't know what type you're dealing with, stop immediately
[05:59:26] <ozzloy> there are rules that can be learned that aren't just "except in that case, because."
[05:59:33] <boxscape_> the neat thing is you can usually tell what type you're dealing with by asking the compiler
[05:59:47] <boxscape_> > map ((+1) :: _) [1..5]
[05:59:49] <lambdabot>  [2,3,4,5,6]
[05:59:57] <boxscape_> I expected it to tell me the type :(

[08:02:36] <superstar64> *system memory and swap.
[08:07:56] <EvanR> Well other than profiling fu... you could try to narrow down where in the program is happening by excising 1/2 of the program at a time
[08:08:16] <EvanR> where in the program the loop is happening
[08:08:35] <EvanR> are you sure its non-termination and not just something very inefficient

[08:11:48] <superstar64> EvanR, I kinda have this problem where running the program makes my system unusable.
[08:12:08] <EvanR> so it's using a lot of memory
[08:12:39] <EvanR> can you run it and press control C very fast to recover
[08:12:55] <EvanR> if so, that's your ticket to starting to bisect search through it

[09:07:08] <sclv> typically if you're running an executable, the cwd is whatever directory your terminal happened to be in when you ran it
[09:07:36] <sclv> which is usually the top level of the cabal project, but obviously it can be anywhere
[09:09:37] <EvanR> so make sure the exe and the user are in that folder
[09:10:11] <sclv> well the exe need not be in that folder
[09:10:55] <EvanR> it would make it convenient to organize the days and run it

[12:45:14] <arahael> I'm trying to make sense of the new Amazonka 2.0 API, and it's very confusing.  How should I make a "Paths"?  (Reference: https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/blob/aeecded1501510d607082bb9a65aa5086755251f/lib/services/amazonka-cloudfront/gen/Amazonka/CloudFront/Types/Paths.hs )

[12:45:57] <arahael> It seems to suggest that I should use 'newPaths', but the implementation doesn't make sense there...  I've got a bunch of paths I want to invalidate, why would I use provide 'nothing'?

[12:49:15] <arahael> I mean, the implementation is: newPaths pQuantity_ = Paths' { items = Prelude.Nothing, quantity = pQuantity_ }
[12:49:21] <arahael> That makes no sense, does it?
[12:53:14] <jackdk> arahael: general amazonka convention: newFoo makes a "minimal" value of a shape (all required fields provided) and then you use lenses to set the remaining fields
[12:53:45] *** Joins: deadmarshal (~deadmarsh@95.38.228.7)
[12:55:10] <jackdk> arahael: https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/blob/0ccede621e56fb6f240e4850e205cde82d0e4a4b/examples/src/S3.hs#L129 look at the way `newTagging` is assembled
[12:57:25] <arahael> jackdk: Why would the number of items differ from the contents, though?  It seems a bit weird.
[12:57:54] <arahael> jackdk: So basically I provide the paths twice - firstly in that 'newPaths' to set the count, and then using lenses again to give the actual paths again?
[12:58:31] <arahael> jackdk: I'm also getting the impression that, eg in that example, @"tagSet" isn't actually a string?
[12:59:20] *** Quits: econo (uid147250@user/econo) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[12:59:42] <jackdk> arahael: it probably wouldn't - amazonka is generated by parsing service and payload defintions from aws' botocore project
[13:00:06] <jackdk> arahael: @"tagSet" is an explicit type application - that's the @ - of a type-level string "tagSet"
[13:00:14] <jackdk> arahael: see https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-lens
[13:01:52] <arahael> Well, that works.  I guess I really do need to give generic-lens a proper read now, and figure out what "type-level strings" are.

[18:12:46] <fusion86> Hey all, for a homework assignment we have to write a simple ical parser. So far so good. However I am currently stuck on verifying whether the lexed tokens actually from a valid structure. For this I need to check whether a token at a given position is of a certain type. I currently do this with a crappy pattern match, but I was wondering whether there is a better way to solve this. Code: https://paste.tomsmeding.co

[18:14:02] <fusion86> This does use an in house parser, but the pattern match thingy should be understandable without knowing about the parser lib.

[21:27:11] <EvanR> actually how did physics even sneak in. Don't you usually just identify what it is you are counting as basic operations and say that has cost 1 or size 1 and go from there. And the result is relative to that and not stephen hawking shit
