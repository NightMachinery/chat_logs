[08:43:15] <Sven_vB> on some of my focal machones, /etc/resolv.conf points to ../run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf. shouldn't it point to ../run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf instead? because that one has my DNS IPs in it. do I need to fix that manually on all affected machines? is it a one-time fix or will it happen on new installs, too?

[08:53:42] <Sven_vB> and my old "list all DNS servers" script fails because it only checks NetworkManager connections, whereas the purpose of my new config is to have DNS be independent from which connection I use. can I still query NM for the DNS IPs, should I just grep them from /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf, or is there an even better way?

[15:50:01] <cubic10> I've got a support question :)
[15:50:02] <cubic10> I am booting into Ubuntu on a Pi4, which is located on an SSD on the usb 3 port. 90% of the time, everything loads properly on boot. But occasionally, there is some error with the USB ports getting addressed properly, and the file system never loads. So eventually the busybox shell comes up. First, I am confused about exactly what is going on here,
[15:50:02] <cubic10> because the boot loader recognized the USB ports, and it seems at least some things loaded from the SSD. Because busy box loaded, and this is part of the Ubuntu side of things, right? But then something went wrong and the file system was unable to finish loading?
[15:50:33] <cubic10> My question is: Is there a way to have it reboot automatically from the busy box shell?
[15:50:37] <Mathisen> Wamphyri, try to mount it in terminal as a test to whatever folder

Anyone know how to tell rdesktop where to find a printer driver? They're saying HP4, but I'm guessing they mean the laserjet4100 driver that everyone used for years.
[20:50:53] <SkinnyCa_> Has anyone else seen issues using the Intel Psteps driver with an intel 8000 series? I have a I7 8650U and it stays locked at 800mhz even at 100% load. AC/DC power make no difference. I disabled the pstate driver and the acpi driver sorta works, but never gets to 4.2Ghz, only 3.9. Thoughts?

[22:22:04] <jhutchins> nunya: That's usually something you can feed to the application on the startup command, either as a part of a shortcut/icon, a menu item, or just from the Alt-F2 launcher (best to test it here first).
[22:22:15] <jhutchins> nunya: Look at the docs for the application and see what it offers.
