[00:31:24] <ms7821> v is 1 on line 99

[00:43:15] <int-e> ms7821: Well, I see no reason why the v=1 variant of field multiplication exists, especially when it's mixed with the v=0 variant. The existence of that code path is very dubious.
[00:43:18] <ms7821> like all the literature is like "don't reuse or leak k" but the attacks I've found involve different messages
[00:46:25] <ms7821> I was wondering if v=1 might be used when you're going to call toEPIF, to allow for much faster calculations?
[00:47:57] <ms7821> like the way you only need to call mod in RSA at the end
[00:48:47] <int-e> maybe that's the idea, but x^163 + x^7 + x^6 + x^3 + 1 isn't a factor of x^171 + x^70 + 1; some other irreducible polynomial of degree 163 is.
[00:50:21] <int-e> too long for IRC; cf. https://paste.debian.net/1234941/
[01:00:00] <int-e> ms7821: toEPIF only looks at the bottom 163 bits, so passing in a result that's not fully reduced modulo... well, I assume x^163 + x^7 + x^6 + x^3 + 1 is the correct polynomial... is not going to work
[01:01:00] <ms7821> yeah https://neuromancer.sk/std/nist/B-163
[01:01:20] <ms7821> (Gx, Gy and sqrtb also match)
[01:01:59] <ms7821> and hmm, I wonder what it means then
[01:02:20] <ms7821> it must be something like "to ECC point in field" but I don't know what that would mean exactly
[01:05:27] <ms7821> I've tried to get my head around ECC stuff properly many times and it just doesn't stick. Like electronics circuit analysis
[01:09:21] <int-e> ms7821: Oh, wait. the *outputs* of toEPIF are multiplied using the v = 1 version?
[01:09:38] <ms7821> hmm, I thought it was the inputs
[01:10:09] <ms7821> guess it's not
[01:10:38] <ms7821> I assumed EPIF was "tied" to the previous functions
[01:10:58] <ms7821> but that doesn't seem to be consistent
[01:10:59] <int-e> And toEPIF uses that big isoTimesAMatrix which might well contain an isomorphism from one GF(2^63) representation to another...
[01:12:04] <ms7821> why would someone do that?
[01:14:06] <ms7821> I can't find EPIF_gx anywhere, but it does match isoTimesAMatrix_1
[01:14:23] <ms7821> and only EPIF_kx is used by this code
[01:16:50] <int-e> isoTimesAMatrix_1 corresponds to x in the Z_2[x]/(x^163 + x^7 + x^6 + x^3 + 1) representation of GF(2^163).
[01:17:03] <ms7821> ahaha I have no idea what that means
[01:20:58] <ms7821> hmm, I wonder if https://patents.google.com/patent/US7200225 is related

[01:48:29] <int-e> ms7821: Okay. This actually makes sense.Â https://paste.debian.net/1234951/ has some key bits of the puzzle.
[01:48:53] <ms7821> oh wow
[01:49:04] <int-e> ms7821: As to why someone would do this, I suppose the lower bit weight of x^171 + x^70 + 1 makes that second representation attractive for hardware implementations
[01:49:40] <ms7821> that's amazing, thank you so much
[01:53:05] <ms7821> so it's calling toEPIF any time it wants to talk to or compare with an output from the device
[01:53:23] <int-e> Yeah, that would be my guess.
[01:54:08] <ms7821> (and uses v=1)
[01:56:18] <int-e> And there's no fromEPIF so testing this may be a bit tricky :)

[01:59:09] <ms7821> the reason I started digging into this was the documentation suggested it was just multiplying rG by q, which would be pretty broken
[01:59:56] <ms7821> but given this shows they've clearly thought hard about the whole flow, and it looks like it is doing at least some sort of signing, I'm going to assume it's not trivially breakable
[02:00:00] <int-e> maybe the right way to test this is to hack toEPIF to be the identity function and drop the check for v = 1 ;-)
[02:00:45] <int-e> But... eh, I think I'm done with this.

[18:52:50] <slave_blocker> P1 = 8 * (1) G
[18:52:55] <slave_blocker> P2 = 8 * (2) G
[18:53:00] <riv> there are many generators of these groups not just one

[19:06:40] <slave_blocker> a little bit .
[19:07:11] <slave_blocker> i'm just missing the link on why thats so special when p is prime
[19:07:12] <int-e> slave_blocker: that group of order 2^3*l may have several subgroups of order 2. But the Sylow thing tells us that there's only one of order l, because l is prime and larger than 2^3.
[19:07:42] <river> prime numbers are special because they cannot be split up at all
[19:07:53] <river> this implies that a group of prime order cannot be split up either
[19:08:07] <int-e> (I don't know whether that larger group is cyclic or not.)
[19:08:35] <slave_blocker> (it does not matter)
[19:08:48] <river> if a large group has p in its prime factorization, but not p^2 - that implies that there is just one subgroup of size p 
[19:08:50] <slave_blocker> the group H is cyclic because it has a prime order.
[19:09:17] <river> but 6 | 12, and there are two distinct size 6 subgroups of C_12
[19:09:18] <int-e> It would matter if you wanted to use that fact about cyclic groups to argue that the subgroup of order l is unique.
[19:09:29] <int-e> river: no
[19:09:42] <river> int-e: no what?

[19:10:00] <int-e> C_12 isn't isomorphic to C_2 x C_2 x C_3, it's C_4 x C_3.
[19:10:07] <river> oh thank you, you are right
[19:10:12] <slave_blocker> uff
[19:10:19] <river> so correction, 6 | 12, and there are two distinct size 6 subgroups of C_2 x C_2 x C_3
[19:10:22] <slave_blocker> i was doubting again :)
[19:10:54] <slave_blocker> hum,
[19:11:14] <slave_blocker> so the order of the groups maps to its prime factorization...
[19:11:47] <river> the connection is this: if H is a subgroup of G then |H| | |G|
[19:11:59] <slave_blocker> yes
[19:12:03] <slave_blocker> by lagrange
[19:12:47] <slave_blocker>  there are two distinct size 6 subgroups of C_2 x C_2 x C_3 ???
[19:13:00] <int-e> 3, actually.
[19:13:08] <slave_blocker> wich ones?
[19:13:31] <int-e> C_2 x C_2 has subgroups of size 2 generated by (1,0), (0,1) and (1,1)
[19:14:11] <slave_blocker> oh my,
[19:14:11] <river> <(1,0,1)> and <(0,1,1)>  + the one int-e has pointed out!
[19:14:18] <river> <(1,1,1)> 
[19:15:09] <slave_blocker> lets just stick with one dimensional arrays?
[19:15:11] <river> note, <(1,0,1)> = {(1,0,1), (0,0,2), (1,0,0), (0,0,1), (1,0,2), (0,0,0)}

[19:17:27] <slave_blocker> so 6 | 12, and the only subgroup of order 6 is :
[19:17:43] <slave_blocker> {0,2,4,6,8,10}
[19:17:51] <river> that's true
[19:18:03] <slave_blocker> ok and 6 is composite

[19:18:19] <int-e> btw, it's not true that there's a subgroup of order d of G whenever d | |G|. Not sure whether this is the simplest example, but A_5 (of order 60) has no subgroup of order 30.
[19:18:21] <river> it's just 3 groups together
[19:18:56] <slave_blocker> river the example i am explaining is not with triples.
[19:19:02] <slave_blocker> thanks and sorry.
[19:19:13] <river> k
[19:20:05] <slave_blocker> i guess to stay whithin the additive subgroups is easyest, the Z_n
[19:20:39] <slave_blocker> so my remaining doubt, is that there is only one subgroup of order k, when k | n .
[19:21:28] <slave_blocker> is this also true ?
[19:22:31] <int-e> again, no.
[19:22:42] <int-e> hmm?
[19:23:02] <int-e> Actually, I'm not sure how to parse this. It may just be a consequence of Lagrange.
[19:23:03] <slave_blocker> <int-e> slave_blocker: that group of order 2^3*l may have several subgroups of order 2?
[19:23:26] <slave_blocker> 2 is also a prime !
[19:23:43] <int-e> That just means that a subgroup of order 2 actually exists.
[19:23:49] <slave_blocker> so it should also only contain one subgroup of order 2...
[19:24:04] <int-e> It doesn't have to be unique... we can't tell that from the group order alone.
[19:24:28] <slave_blocker> ...
[19:24:49] <int-e> C_2 x C_2 x C_2 x C_l has the right order and *7* subgroups of order 2.
[19:25:13] <int-e> Whereas C_8 x C_l has only one.
[19:26:47] <slave_blocker> ok
[19:26:57] <slave_blocker> say n = 44
[19:27:04] <slave_blocker> Z_44
[19:27:31] <slave_blocker> i claim there are no 2 subgroups with the same order in there.
[19:28:20] <int-e> C_44? That's cyclic, so sure.
[19:29:02] <slave_blocker> 44 = 2Â² * 11
[19:29:08] <int-e> But if we just know that the order of the group is 44, then while we can infer that there's exactly one subgroup of order 11, we can't say whether the subgroups of order 2 are unique.
[19:29:53] <slave_blocker> ok find me 2 groups of order 2 in there then.
[19:29:56] <slave_blocker> please
[19:30:36] <int-e> C_2 x C_2 x C_11 has three subgroups of order 2, generated by (1,0,0), (0,1,0) and (1,1,0), respectively. C_44 is cyclic, so it has only one subgroup of order 2.
[19:30:37] <slave_blocker> there is one : {0, 22}
[19:31:06] <int-e> Not all groups are cyclic.
[19:31:23] <slave_blocker> but 44 is not prime why should it be cyclic
[19:31:24] <slave_blocker> ?
[19:31:48] <int-e> C_44 is generated by a single element, 1.
[19:31:53] <int-e> That's what "cyclic" means.
[19:32:13] <slave_blocker> oh
[19:32:26] <int-e> C_2 x C_2 x C_11 is *not* generated by a single element. So not cyclic. But its order is also 44.
[19:32:34] <slave_blocker> i thought it means that every element in that group generate the group
[19:33:12] <int-e> learning++
[19:33:17] <slave_blocker> ...
[19:33:45] <slave_blocker> ok
[19:34:12] <int-e> slave_blocker: I mean, now you know better. That's a gain, isn't it?
[19:34:39] <slave_blocker> so you are saying that every Z_n, is generated at least by a single element, 1.
[19:34:51] <slave_blocker> when Z_p then is it abelian?
[19:35:04] <int-e> All cyclic groups are abelian.
[19:35:26] <int-e> In terms of the generating element g, g^a g^b = g^(a+b) = g^(b+a) = g^b g^a
[19:35:47] <slave_blocker> however from what i understood is that in the case of Z_n the order of each subgroup depends on its divisibility on n.

[19:39:33] <slave_blocker> int-e, so you are saying that in the case of N = 2Â³ * l, there is only one subgroup of order 2 ?
[19:39:44] <int-e> I don't know.
[19:39:56] <int-e> I don't know whether that group is cyclic or not.
[19:40:00] <int-e> It hinges on that.
[19:40:04] <slave_blocker> so the possible orders for the subgroups are :
[19:40:21] <int-e> But... we only care about the subgroup of order l, so why dwell on it?
[19:40:38] <slave_blocker> 1,2,4,8,l,2l,4l,8l
[19:41:05] <slave_blocker> thats also true !
[19:41:11] <int-e> (We don't need cyclicity for uniqueness of that subgroup. That's why I brought up the Sylow theorems... they're heavy, but they show this.)
[19:42:21] <slave_blocker> i was trying to figure out a more general pattern so that it sticks for life.
[19:42:37] <slave_blocker> N = 2Â³ * l
[19:42:56] <slave_blocker> N = 2Â² * 2 * l
[19:43:38] <slave_blocker> N = 2 * 2 * 2 * l
[19:44:37] <slave_blocker> so there must be a mapping of the prime factors to the subgroups...
[19:45:12] <slave_blocker> there must be only one subgroup of size 2, one of size 4, one of size 8 ...
[19:46:03] <slave_blocker> but i can't explain this in a verbatim manner...
