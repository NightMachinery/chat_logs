[21:01:08] <jelly> yes, you're exposed to MITM that way

[21:02:48] <jelly> every debian mirror might be on untrusted infra
[21:03:55] <jelly> and it does not matter one bit, because apt will notice if a repo signature or a package does not match any of the keys in your preinstalled debian-keyring set

[22:11:52] <cheche> so I bridge just the data, i do not want to touch the voice stuff. and I do not use TV
[22:12:08] <PMT> cheche: do you know which VLAN the voice data is?
[22:12:32] <cheche> yes. Voz: ID 3 priority 4
[22:13:01] <cheche> yes. VoICE: ID 3 P 4
[22:13:32] <PMT> So not no VLAN tag. It would be...improbable for you to be hitting that VLAN.

[23:40:41] <tesseract> :O ah. i think i installed buster before it was released
[23:41:33] <jmcnaught> I think the Vega GPU integrated into the 2400G is even older too, I think bullseye will run on it okay.
