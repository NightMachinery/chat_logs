[01:09:37] <Joanna> Hi norayr thanks I’ll look
[01:17:17] <Joanna> norayr: what’s happening with people you know in Ukraine? Can you still talk to them?
[01:26:56] <Joanna> I don’t think the government of Russia is independent judging by its reaction to Covid. This war in Ukraine could be to consolidate power by destroying economies of many countries. In other words I think there is collusion from the people who are supposedly enemies. American officials have been investing in defense industry stocks I’ve heard.

[01:37:04] <CalimeroTeknik> pretty deserving of attention, this https://youtu.be/7ZnIUSvPtdo (U.S. senator position)
[02:09:22] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: one possible result of all the sanctions could be that countries stop using dollars and Americans can’t buy imported things
[02:11:09] <Joanna> Maybe the objective is world government. Every world war seems to consolidate more power into fewer groups of people
[02:12:52] <Joanna> I predicted that America would end in famine a few years back. Without oil Americans will be stranded and starving.
[02:15:59] <shibboleth> why, how?
[02:17:03] <shibboleth> .us is the 3rd largest country by area, has a relatively small population, excellent farmland
[02:17:30] <shibboleth> and with temp rises, canadas uility will increase

[02:20:08] <shibboleth> (longhorn)
[02:23:03] <Joanna> To simply the most likely objective is to kill people and take their stuff
[02:23:25] <CalimeroTeknik> Joanna, at least, what's true is that revolutions are easily channelled by opportunists, causing a simplification of the power structure
[02:24:28] <CalimeroTeknik> but this doesn't concentrate power unless the social structure exists for it, or is destroyed also
[02:24:43] <Joanna> I’m not sure if genuine revolutions not orchestrated buy outsiders happen very often
[02:25:19] <Joanna> By
[02:25:24] <CalimeroTeknik> these days, with all the international connections, we see more globalised phenomena unfold, that's valid
[02:25:39] <shibboleth> well, afghanistan went shit-show both time outside forces stopped caring, so...
[02:26:26] <Joanna> If you look at what people will tolerate without rebellion it’s pretty amazing
[02:26:37] <CalimeroTeknik> that's perhaps a slightly short-sighted view of it, shibboleth ^^
[02:27:06] <shibboleth> short-sighted? it looks back 40 years
[02:27:17] <Joanna> Afghanistan was a big success for war profiteers
[02:29:42] <Joanna> The irony is only governments without human rights can resist color revolutions so the people responsible for the color revolutions are accomplishing the exact opposite of what they claim to be.

[02:31:55] <shibboleth> Joanna, the fall of the ussr?
[02:32:15] <Joanna> shibboleth: do you mean 2014?
[02:32:23] <shibboleth> no, 1991
[02:32:50] <Joanna> I’m not sure what caused end off ussr
[02:33:02] <shibboleth> ?
[02:33:09] <Joanna> Was it bankruptcy?
[02:33:17] <Joanna> Sorry typo
[02:33:25] <shibboleth> not what i meant
[02:33:57] <shibboleth> well, they were spending 30% of revenue to keep up with .us/nato
[02:34:12] <shibboleth> were goaded into their own, cozy vietnam in afghanistan
[02:34:20] <shibboleth> chernobyl wasn't cheap
[02:34:35] <shibboleth> well, they were spending 30% of revenue on .mil to keep up with .us/nato even
[02:34:39] <Joanna> There have been many governments taken down by their own stupid citizens being tricked or outsiders coming in to cause trouble
[02:34:58] <shibboleth> yeah, like in south america

[02:36:04] <Joanna> Iran
[02:36:13] <shibboleth> mad man mousadegh, yyes
[02:36:43] <Joanna> Somehow Iran regained control. Or seemed to
[02:38:11] <shibboleth> what i'm saying is that in the case of eastern europe there was a peaceful transition of... "style of government"
[02:38:34] <Joanna> What about Yugoslavia? They destroyed that
[02:38:41] <shibboleth> themselves
[02:38:59] <Joanna> Operation gladio
[02:39:01] <shibboleth> over ethnic/religious stuff
[02:39:44] <Joanna> Yugoslavia was bombed and attacked the same way as Ukraine
[02:40:08] <shibboleth> serbia, you mean?
[02:40:13] <Joanna> They use the ethnic differences to their advantage
[02:40:25] <shibboleth> got NATOed to stop a genocide
[02:40:55] <Joanna> Yea they really care about genocides :)
[02:41:25] <Joanna> I heard they are killing people in Yemen at moment
[02:41:34] <shibboleth> no, you're right. they wanted serbias...
[02:41:43] <shibboleth> uhm....
[02:41:58] <shibboleth> err...
[02:42:26] <shibboleth> goats?
[02:43:21] <Joanna> I read a book called to kill a nation that gave all the details of how they destroyed Yugoslavia. They started with attacking financial attacks like getting rid of their jobs and pensions
[02:43:31] <shibboleth> they were envious of how many consonants they have in their names?
[02:43:42] <Joanna> Who knows
[02:44:50] <Joanna> It currently looks like the us is trying to drag Europe into another world war.
[02:45:24] <shibboleth> there was a genocide happening and no one was worried about serbia militarily

[02:58:36] <elkclone> perhaps the nato comment was in the context of serbia/ugoslavia conflicts. 
[03:00:26] <elkclone> Biden just shared some of his own insights about cyber attacks being tottally expected at this point along with bio/chem use and subsequent consequences. 
[03:00:55] <elkclone> He is at the Business quarterly meeting. 
[03:02:32] <elkclone> speaking about the current ukraine/russia conflict.  I think he may of even just blurted out ' It's about to get real!' . 
[03:02:40] <shibboleth> yugoslavia remained neutral-adjacent for the cold war and both sides were "generous" in looking for influence

[03:17:14] <shibboleth> hmmmmmmmmmm
[03:17:17] <shibboleth> i dunno...
[03:18:09] <shibboleth> (and said higher oil prices once again makes shale/fracking profitable, back from the situation following 2014)
[03:18:49] <Joanna> Yugoslavia wasn’t just people in different ethnic groups parting ways it had a lot of outsiders meddling just like Ukraine
[03:20:41] <Joanna> What about Vietnam war started because of gulf of Tonkin incident which turned out to be a lie? Or the babies in incubators lie . It amazes me how people can keep falling for the same tricks over and over again
[03:20:59] <shibboleth> wmd?
[03:21:17] <Joanna> Yep that too
[03:22:16] <shibboleth> well, he did have chemical weapons
[03:22:34] <shibboleth> the components of which the us had sold saddam
[03:22:52] <Joanna> America sold sadam nerve gas to use on Iran and gas Kurds with but that was never a problem. The real reason for attacking Iraq was probably he wanted to sell oil in a currency besides dollars
[03:24:08] <Joanna> It should be interesting now because of sanctions more countries might go to the alternative to swift to get around sanctions
[03:24:51] <shibboleth> yeah, and have their .us/.eu assets seized?
[03:25:02] <shibboleth>  /frozen
[03:25:40] <Joanna> shibboleth: I think sadam made a very foolish mistake of letting in weapons inspectors which had covert ops piggybacked on them.
[03:26:27] <shibboleth> so he... should've refused?
[03:26:43] <Joanna> shibboleth: maybe but what can they do if they are addicted to fossil fuels ?
[03:27:20] <Joanna> I think he should have not let in inspectors and not destroyed his weapons
[03:27:40] <Joanna> Look at North Korea. They haven’t been invaded yet :)
[03:27:55] <shibboleth> because: china
[03:28:09] <Joanna> That helps :)
[03:28:15] <shibboleth> and they were invaded
[03:28:33] <Joanna> Yea Korean War
[03:28:39] <shibboleth> and then mao sent in "volunteers" to help them fight back
[03:29:01] <shibboleth> quite a few of them, if memory serves
[03:29:28] <shibboleth> but said invasion was in response to the north invading the south
[03:29:38] <Joanna> But there are theories that mao was funded by the west and killed millions of Chinese
[03:29:47] <shibboleth> supposedly following unclear messaging by the us
[03:30:24] <shibboleth> Joanna, yes. try asking taiwan about that
[03:30:24] <Joanna> I’m not sure who did the one child policy in China
[03:30:44] <shibboleth> general changs wife had strong ties to .us
[03:30:50] <Joanna> They like to fund both sides of things
[03:31:19] <shibboleth> they already had an ally in chang
[03:31:22] <Joanna> They fund both black militants and white supremicists have
[03:31:35] <Joanna> And have them fight
[03:31:49] <shibboleth> fund some uprising to topple him, fast forward 60 years and china has a bigger gdp than the us?
[03:31:54] <shibboleth> hmmm, great plan
[03:32:30] <shibboleth> why is it black *militants* and white *supremist*?
[03:32:31] <Joanna> Whose idea was it to move all manufacturing to China?

[03:33:27] <shibboleth> i'm asking you
[03:33:48] <shibboleth> why are blacks militants and whites supremist in your mind?
[03:34:23] <Joanna> I’m just saying what they are called by other people I didn’t name them. It definitely has bias
[03:34:25] <shibboleth> militant even
