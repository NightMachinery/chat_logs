[01:45:11] <blackop> what is the difference between "debian desktop environment" and "gnome" ?
[01:46:09] <Guest560> gnome IS a desktop environment like others
[01:46:16] <ansgar> blackop: "Debian Desktop Environment" installs task-desktop which installs a bit more than gnome.
[01:46:17] <sney> debian desktop environment is task-desktop, which has packages that are useful for any desktop environment. like desktop-base, sudo, firefox-esr
[01:46:31] <blackop> ansgar: which means?
[01:46:48] *** Joins: lukaso666 (~lukaso666@109.95.146.59)
[01:46:50] <blackop> sney: they are both also exist in gnome
[01:46:58] <sney> if you look at 'apt show task-desktop' and 'apt show task-gnome-desktop' you can see the difference yourself. look especially at the Depends and Recommends fields.
[01:46:59] <joepublic> Debian desktop environment is all the usual programs one would want with a desktop environment, while gnome is a desktop environment itself which prides itself on removing anything productive or familiar
[01:47:05] <ansgar> blackop: apt show task-desktop, look at Depends & Recommends besides task-gnome-desktop | alternatives
[01:47:41] <blackop> ok
[01:48:02] <tesseract> is it new for bullseye?
[01:48:15] <sney> no, this is how it's been for a while
[01:48:39] <tesseract> lol i didnt know that
[01:49:03] <tesseract> i wonder which one i installed
[01:49:20] <sney> if you used the defaults in the installer, you got both
[01:49:35] <sney> which is how it's supposed to work. debian desktop environment, and *also* one of the desktop options
[01:49:39] <blackop> default is debian desktop environment
[01:49:46] <tesseract> i installed buster and upgraded
[01:49:54] <blackop> busterd :p
[01:50:32] <blackop> sney: what? should we also install one of the desktop options with debian environment?
[01:50:35] <tesseract> i have libre office preistalled
[01:50:43] *** Joins: cachinnate (~cach@user/cachinnate)
[01:51:04] <sney> yes blackop that's what I said
[01:51:24] <blackop> i thought they are both separated desktops
[01:51:30] <blackop> debian also gnome
[01:51:50] <blackop> so i always choose 1 desktop
[01:51:53] *** Joins: Steeve (~steve@user/steeve)
[01:51:59] <blackop> no debian
[01:52:13] <sney> this is what it looks like. debian desktop environment is the top level category, and then the other ones below it are options. https://i.ibb.co/KW82VnZ/image.png
[01:52:16] <blackop> maybe i made a mistake because this build feels a bit buggy
[01:52:23] <sney> if you leave gnome unselected, you still get gnome, because it's first.
[01:52:44] <blackop> hmmm
[01:52:54] <sney> it works this way because of how debian package dependencies work.
[01:53:07] <blackop> i unselected debian environment and selected gnome
[01:53:32] <blackop> damn
[01:53:40] <sney> task-gnome-desktop depends on task-desktop, so you got it anyway.
[01:54:03] <sney> if you look at the package Depends and Recommends fields, you can see this yourself, as ansgar and I previously suggested
[01:54:17] <blackop> yea i saw it
[01:54:36] <blackop> anyone using discord app on debian?
[01:54:58] <sney> are you taking a poll or do you have a question
[01:55:15] <blackop> i wonder if it has a tray icon on top bar
[01:55:19] <blackop> which i dont have
[01:55:41] <blackop> i tried same package on ubuntu and ubuntu has tray icon on top right
[01:56:03] <blackop> i installed gnome appindicator extension, still it doesnt show tray icon
[01:56:12] <sney> discord uses an indicator library that was removed from debian, that's probably why.
[01:56:15] <blackop> while it shows telegram tray icon
[01:56:27] <blackop> hmm
[01:56:29] <sney> #895037

[01:56:41] <joepublic> you also may have got the impression that people here care about ubuntu, which would broadly be misleading.
[01:56:44] <blackop> it asked this while installing
[01:57:12] <blackop> sney: why is that removed?
[01:57:25] <sney> do you want me to read the bug report to you
[01:58:21] <tesseract> sney: do you have mic?
[01:58:59] <blackop> sney: snap app of discord has tray icon
[01:59:10] <blackop> i dont wanna use snap but for some apps i think i need it :/
[01:59:46] <sney> snaps don't need debian dependencies, that's one thing they're good for, if someone like discord is using obsolete libraries then you can use the snap which is completely self-contained
[02:00:18] <blackop> is it self?
[02:00:28] <blackop> but why is it using "root" ?
[02:00:53] <blackop> it is installing in root dir i think
[02:01:02] <blackop> there is /root/snap/discord/
[02:01:13] <blackop> s/self/safe/
[02:02:12] <tesseract> it must be rootception
[02:02:23] <tesseract> roor inside a box
[02:02:33] <tesseract> i have ni idea
[02:02:38] <blackop> is using snap safe?
[02:02:44] <sney> all applications install as root, whether they are debs or snaps etc. whether it's safe depends on how much you trust the app vendor. if the discord snap was going to do something bad to your computer, the deb would too.
[02:02:53] <blackop> i read somewhere about fedora that they are gonna not allow snap usage
[02:03:11] <sney> fedora uses flatpak instead which is a different approach to the same thing
[02:03:32] <jmcnaught> flatpaks can be installed without root.
[02:03:34] <blackop> different shade of blue of the same shit :p
[02:03:59] <Guest560> It scares me to the bones the feeling that some of you are able to invade OSs

[02:51:49] <PerfDave> Yes, it depends on your definition of "timely updates". Debian Stable only provides updates when there are security issues, but can't cherry-pick them for Chromium because the codebase changes too quickly.
[02:52:23] <PerfDave> I still install Privacy Badger on all my browsers of course :)
[02:55:31] <sney> chromium 90, which is in bullseye, still gets maintenance updates from upstream; one was pushed about 2 weeks ago

[03:08:41] <somiaj> yea, it is a bit uncerntain when they consider an issue large enough to push out a release
[03:09:45] <PerfDave> OTOH it looks like some of these issues are e.g. Android-only

[03:10:43] *** dfch is now known as yandere_dfch
[03:11:33] <sney> yeah. browsers will always have a CVE high score since they're complicated and have a big attack surface, etc. the debian security team tries to keep on top of the ones that are actually relevant to debian users, though that means that many others will stay open or eventually get rolled up
[03:12:43] <PerfDave> It does look like a lot of those CVEs are autogenerated from Chrome, and may well not apply to Debian's Chromium build.

[17:52:28] <no_gravity> I see.
[17:52:35] <Khepra> both (server and client TLS certs) do the same thing: certify taht a signature is "valid" according to trusted CAs.  That is why oyu need to be a trusted CA yourself to have your client certs

[21:41:29] <sney> rufus does not treat the debian installer well
[21:41:41] <greycat> Or are you saying you didn't fucking READ the factoid?
[21:41:44] <sney> make sure to check "dd mode" - gpt or mbr does not matter for the installer

[21:43:49] <blackop> english is not my native language, i may not get your impression very well
[21:45:08] <blackop> Write in ISO image mode (recommended)
[21:45:16] <jmcnaught> blackop: if rufus is asking you about GPT or MBR when copying the Debian ISO to USB then you are in the wrong spot.  Either use Rufus's "dd" mode, or use win32diskimager instead.
[21:45:22] <blackop> last time i checked DD mode i remember i had some issues
[21:45:46] <blackop> jmcnaught: it has ISO or DD mode
[21:45:56] <blackop> so people here advise me to use DD mode
[21:45:57] <randall> blackop: You're probably remembering it the wrong way around.
[21:45:58] <sney> blackop: you have to use dd mode. we know this from extensive experience.
[21:46:05] <blackop> ook
[21:46:16] <sney> blackop: if you use iso mode instead, and come back and complain that it's broken, we will just laugh at you.
[21:46:20] <blackop> writing in DD mode
[21:46:39] <blackop> sney: i always use default in rufus which is MBR - ISO mode
[21:46:41] <blackop> never had problem
[21:46:52] <blackop> i actually dont know difference between ISO and DD
[21:47:01] <sney> then why did you even ask a question if you're already an expert?
[21:47:25] <sney> the debian installer is a usb image. dd mode writes it directly to usb, without changing it.
[21:47:38] <blackop> did i say i am an expert?
[21:47:47] <sney> iso mode unpacks the image and rewrites it with some internal rufus voodoo, which breaks the debian installer.

[21:58:30] <another|> I meant it shouldn't be neccessary anymore to use something like rufus' "magic" mode
[22:00:38] <sney> unfortunately, the rufus developer doesn't care, someone from debian contacted them a year or so ago to get it to detect debian images correctly and not recommend iso mode
[22:01:03] <sney> rufus is too proud of iso mode to turn it off in any case, apparently.

[22:25:05] <blackop> 308mb downloaded so far
[22:25:20] <blackop> s/is/are
[22:25:38] <somiaj> rufus and ventoy are different things, just use a tool that has direct write capabilities, in windows win32diskimager is often suggested here, though more and mroe of the tools like rufus have a dd or direct copy option you can togle.
[22:26:03] <somiaj> Though unsure if things hvae changed, but debian iso images sometimes have trouble with chaing booting with something like ventoy
[22:26:25] <sney> the firmware-iwlwifi package is about 13MB. if you are downloading hundreds of MBs, you clicked on the wrong thing. possibly by ignoring what people told you.
[22:27:02] <somiaj> blackop: what are you downloading, the firmware packages aren't too big.

[22:35:19] <blackop> i thought finding all of the 19 firmware files can fix it
[22:35:43] <blackop> maybe i shouldnt be that much obsessed about dmesg error messages
[22:36:01] <sney> that would be a good start.
[22:36:16] *** Quits: milkt (~debian@gateway/tor-sasl/milkt) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:36:19] <somiaj> the kernel is very verbose, just alike many things in linux. I would focus more on the actual problem and asking for recommended solutions vs creating one that isn't there
[22:36:41] <somiaj> in this case the problem is, "I need the firmware for my intel wifi card" and the solution is "install the firmware-iwlwifi package"
[22:36:49] <blackop> does adding extra firmware cause problem?
[22:37:10] <locrian9> Is there a certain firewall rule in netfilter 'iptables' that needs to be present besides 'ACCEPT all -- 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED' to allow Debian to connect to mirrors to get the 'apt-get update' working?
[22:37:16] <somiaj> in theory it shouldn't but manging your firmware though apt is easier than via manually downloading stuff
[22:37:27] <blackop> ok
[22:37:51] <somiaj> in general part of the power of debian is being able to use apt/dpkg to manage what is installed on your computer
[22:38:18] <somiaj> so circumventing it can at minimum cause more work, and at worst conflict with debian packages causing unforseen problems
[22:38:42] <tesseract> blackop: you don't have to install all firmwares that dmesg complains
[22:39:17] <tesseract> for example it complains about ethernet and intel huc firmware and i don^t care

[22:39:31] <locrian9> Checking that my posts are hitting channel.  Testing: 1,2,3
[22:39:59] <somiaj> locrian9: have you installed a custom firewall on your machine. By default debian has no firewall so nothing is needed
[22:40:06] <sney> locrian9: debian does not ship with any firewall rules enabled by default, so the firewall configuration required for outgoing http would depend on what else your firewall is doing
[22:41:22] <locrian9> I'm not running any other firewall other than the linux netfilter (iptables) that was on the machine.
[22:41:41] <sney> and on debian, iptables is empty by default.
[22:41:55] <sney> so if you are having trouble with apt update, it's not a firewall issue. what's the error?
[22:41:58] <somiaj> the default rules (which is basically) nothing will not interfere with apt update, sounds like we have an XY problem here.
[22:42:08] <somiaj> unless of course you decided to modify the rules yourself
