[01:54:40] <KevinX> yeah, we can use tooling to make our workflow more efficient ;-)
[01:55:03] <ljharb> indeed, linting can prevent erroneous code from being committed in the first place
[01:55:09] <KevinX> Here's seemingly how prettier will handle it: https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/1129#issuecomment-292243414
[01:55:41] <KevinX> 2017 comment though but came up in Google
[01:56:16] <earthToAdam> ljharb KevinX Interesting. Just started reading about "automatic semicolon insertion". So it's not that it's optional at all. It's just that JS cleans up our mess behind the scenes.

[01:56:26] <ljharb> earthToAdam: exactly, yes
[01:57:01] <ljharb> earthToAdam: also, before about 2016 or so, there didn't exist a linter or tool that could verify that code that omits semicolons was correct. so any opinions preferring ASI from before that time should be disregarded.
[01:57:24] <DPA> If it's syntactically valid, it's not an error. Yes, it does something different, and that is exactly why it shouldn't be automatically changed. The programmer should be trusted that he didn't write the wrong thing.
[01:57:24] <DPA> It is a good idea to have more strict standards, and not accept such code after linting, and let the programmer clarify what they meant. But the meaning of the program should never just be changed by a tool, just because surely people get it wrong.
[01:57:33] <earthToAdam> hmm... okay, they're going back in! :D
[01:57:53] <ljharb> DPA: lots of things are both syntactically valid and also errors
[01:58:11] <ljharb> DPA: "the programmer should be trusted" is an opinion that gets incinerated with a modicum of experience with programmers.
[01:58:23] <KevinX> Prettier is an opinionated tool by design too
[01:58:24] <ljharb> DPA: adding semicolons doesn't change the meaning of a program
[01:58:43] <ljharb> i agree that an autofix should not change the meaning of a program. but the linter should still prohibit your incorrect code from being merged til *you* fix it :-)
[01:59:36] <earthToAdam> Personally, I find it's easier (and safer) if I keep things black & white. Yes, semicolons can be omitted (under certain circumstances). But why add unnecessary complexity? Since these cannot be omitted ALL the time, it seems like this just invites an opportinity for failure.

[01:59:59] <DPA> If it indeed doesn't insert the semicolon where it would change the programs meaning, then I think it's okay.
[02:00:32] <KevinX> Do whatever vibes the best with how you like to write code, and lean in to tooling to fill in the gaps
[02:00:43] <KevinX> within reason of course
[02:00:50] <KevinX> We do live in a society after all
[02:02:56] <earthToAdam> Yeah... I'm going to have to get more familiar with my Linter...

[02:05:51] <KevinX> importance is project consistency though. Most of it can be automated
[02:06:20] <bobdobbs> Can someone help me understand react useState? I've been experimenting with it for a bit, but I don't really quite understand it.
[02:06:30] *** Quits: rendar (~rendar@user/rendar) (Quit: Leaving)
[02:06:49] <bobdobbs> So my understanding is that the useState hook is critical if I want to use state in functional components...
[02:06:49] <earthToAdam> KevinX is your man.
[02:07:06] <ljharb> earthToAdam: exactly right
[02:07:19] <bobdobbs> I know that it returns two things: the value of "state", and a function to alter that state
[02:07:20] <ljharb> earthToAdam: also, new language features will undoubtedly create more "ASI hazards"
[02:07:34] <ljharb> earthToAdam: so it's much safer (and always has been) to use semicolons wherever appropriate
[02:08:18] <bobdobbs> Now, I might be overthinking it - and I'm new to modern js development - but I don't really understand about the function that useState returns.
[02:08:45] <KevinX> I would say it's like one of those situations where you shouldn't break the rules until you understand them regardless to how you feel about semicolons
[02:09:04] <bobdobbs> Like, the value of state can be just about anything, right? A single primitive, an array, an object.
[02:09:14] <KevinX> bobdobbs it returns the state, and a setter that you use to update the state
[02:09:21] <bobdobbs> hai KevinX
[02:09:41] <ljharb> KevinX: 1000% true
[02:09:59] <ljharb> KevinX: always follow the prevailing best practices until you're expert enough to understand why they're there
[02:10:28] <earthToAdam> ljharb KevinX I like that :)
[02:11:08] <bobdobbs> KevinX: I want to know a little about the setter function. Like, if the value of state can be just about anything, how does the setter anticipate all possible ways in which the state value can be altered?
[02:11:30] <bobdobbs> also, sorry if this is a dumb question
[02:12:17] <KevinX> The update goes through the setter function so it knows from that by comparing the previous value
[02:13:16] <bobdobbs> Should I just think of it as a blackbox?
[02:14:11] *** Joins: banana_ (~banana_@user/banana/x-2944094)
[02:14:39] <KevinX> Just avoid using objects for now probably, until you get more comfortable
[02:14:43] <bobdobbs> kk
[02:15:14] <bobdobbs> At the moment I'm working with a tutorial that gives this as a working example:  https://codesandbox.io/s/7z31woqo9q?file=/src/index.js
[02:15:28] <KevinX> Not entirely sure what you mean by blackbox, but maybe that soudns right
[02:15:38] <bobdobbs> It's pretty simple. But I'm still pretty much starting at line 15 and wondering what setMessage does
[02:16:14] <bobdobbs> I'm probably just thinking about it too much and I should get on with the tutorial
[02:17:01] <KevinX> you can name it anything though
[02:17:51] <bobdobbs> "changeTheThing"
[02:17:59] <KevinX> the return value of `useState` you are putting into two variables. I think its called destructuring assignment
[02:18:32] <sheetjs> setMessage is best treated as a blackbox for now
[02:18:36] <bobdobbs> I think that might be called "array destructuring"? I've seen that phrased used to destructuring into an array
[02:18:47] <KevinX> i bet the source is pretty simple to read. I'll see if i can find it
[02:19:13] <sheetjs> bobdobbs: all you need to know is that useState returns an array of 2 items, the first one is the actual value and the second is a function that lets you change the value
[02:19:25] <bobdobbs> sheetjs: kk
[02:19:47] <sheetjs> when you call the second function, it schedules an update and magic happens
[02:20:05] <bobdobbs> I see
[02:20:39] <KevinX> Yeah, it's really that simple

[07:18:47] <onosendi> Now you're mutating, but whatever.
[07:19:04] <velix> mutating?
[07:19:26] <onosendi> You're mutating `items` with `push`.

[07:19:43] <velix> But your code helped me.
[07:20:01] <velix> mine: storageItems.map((e) => Array(e.quantity).fill().map(() => items.push(e.id)));

[12:15:15] <friend> that's great, thank you. Can you explain why use ${x} instead of just x?
[12:15:32] <corwin> that interpolates
[12:15:40] <theskillwithin> i thought you meant something more like https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-create-every-combination-possible-for-the-contents-of-two-arrays-in-javascript
[12:15:41] <friend> meaning?
[12:15:56] <corwin> it would be the same as x + arr2[i]
[12:16:37] <corwin> but the backtick syntax replaces constructs like ${<foo>} with the value of <foo>
[12:17:51] <friend> n>const arr1=["a","b","c"]; const arr2=[1,2,3]; const arr3=arr1.map((x,y)=>x+y); console.log(arr3)

[12:20:20] <friend> theskillwithin, that article is the one that I used orginally and it is ugly. Someone here wrote the same thing in literally 1 line and I lost it.
[12:21:05] <friend> yours seems to work great. I'm just not used to using the backtick and ${} syntax.
[12:21:18] <theskillwithin> mine isn't doing what you want tho
[12:22:57] <corwin> some love the backtick syntax, some hate it.  it's worth being familiar with, in any case.

[20:15:19] <eug_oe> qswz, if I put https://graphql-todos.eugeniob90.repl.co/ as the endpoint

[20:16:04] <onosendi> mikrosis: You want to clear the contents of the cart when a successful order is placed?
[20:16:11] <qswz> mikrosis: if the card is in your state, reset the state
[20:16:17] <onosendi> ^
[20:16:47] <mikrosis> The cart is a React context, I can call reset() on that cart context to empty it.
[20:16:55] <qswz> const [card, setCard]=useState(...)
[20:17:20] <qswz> you need to expose methods to do it then
[20:17:54] <qswz> import methods that allows updaring the card context
[20:18:00] <mikrosis> qswz: it would be also nice to mark the cart as "sent". When the cart content changed, the mutation should also be reset so it can be send again
[20:18:14] <mikrosis> ah, so a custom hook for the cart context?

[21:00:56] <Guest53> Hello I am wondering if it is possible to exclude cookies based on a certain subdomain https://dpaste.org/nbY1
[21:02:01] <qswz> Guest53: no idea about django
[21:02:17] <qswz> but with express, you can create server-side cookies, passing domain
[21:02:22] <Guest53> that is ok. what about javascript?
[21:02:49] <qswz> https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie
[21:03:08] <Guest53> would you need to put the root/subdomains in an array, loop through them, and have them in the set cookie header?
[21:03:12] <qswz> cookie.serialize({domain: 'sub.foo.com', ...
[21:03:31] <qswz> don't use client-side cookies
[21:03:40] <Guest53> can you have multiple domains/subdomain in the set cookie header?
[21:04:53] <qswz> I doubt so
[21:05:04] <qswz> but you can have multiple Set-Cookie
[21:05:21] <Guest53> yes multiple set cookie is what i am thinking too

[21:08:18] <Guest53>   Servers SHOULD NOT include more than one Set-Cookie header field in
[21:08:18] <Guest53>    the same response with the same cookie-name.
[21:08:19] <qswz> I've often used darken, lighten, getLuminance
[21:08:21] <onosendi> qswz: awesome, thanks. I'll take a look.
[21:08:36] <onosendi> qswz: yeah, those are exactly what I need.
[21:08:37] <Guest53> That means do not have multiple domains in 1 set cookie header?
[21:08:46] <Guest53> you can have 3 set cookie headers though?

[21:09:27] <qswz> yes
[21:09:32] <Guest53> ok
[21:09:43] <qswz> they must be different names? didn't know about it
[21:10:08] <qswz> do you want to set cookie for all possible subdomaines?
[21:10:17] <Guest53> so your browser basically has 3 set cookie headers with each their own unique domain in it? The cookie name could be the same for all 3?
[21:10:41] <Guest53> Not all of them. I want to exclude some
[21:10:57] <qswz> ah ok, else maybe a wildcard could do it, nvm
[21:11:27] <Guest53> Yea I was able to easily do it with a wildcard. But there are cases where you don't want the cookies to be set for a certain subdomain
[21:12:48] <Guest53> That is why I am thinking if I put all the domains I want in an array and don't put the subdomains I don't want in that array, set a cookie for all the ones in the array and they should then only apply to those domains?
[21:13:00] <qswz> yea try to group your endpoints that need same cookie under same subdomain
[21:13:08] <Guest53> Right
[21:13:35] <Guest53> Ok I will try a few things and see what happens I guess

[21:13:46] <onosendi> qswz: this seems to solve a lot of stuff I've implemented on my own, not just colors.

[22:20:36] <codebam> if it's for protecting from viruses, I doubt someone would bother giving you an index.html to open, they would just have you click a link

[22:40:10] <theskillwithin> the browser enforces CORS, not modules
[22:40:26] <codebam> is that just a bug, because it's not "cross origin" when it's under the same file:/// context?

[22:56:24] <blueagain> that's just turning the browser more and more into a web server, that's strictly speaking out of its responsibilities

[23:01:51] <blueagain> just think about it as "to distribute a *modern* app I need a web server"
[23:02:10] <blueagain> only reason you can use iife is that it's an older way of doing it, and they wouldn't break it for compatibility
[23:03:10] <codebam> yeah why do I need a web server to distribute a modern app?
[23:03:26] <codebam> seems unnecessary
[23:03:57] <blueagain> because modern apps are more secure, and part of it is having a web server
