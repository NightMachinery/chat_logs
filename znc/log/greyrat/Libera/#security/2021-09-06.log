[20:54:57] <piou> relipse: frankly, even just calling your recipient to agree on a password then using a 7zip encrypted archive with the document is already a huuuuge increase in security, there's just little reason to send things in clear
[20:55:32] <relipse> but what exactly is the concern here, is it just worried about email provider humans looking into inboxes?
[20:55:39] <piou> Furthermore the thing with security is that it never works retrospectively. Something you neglected years ago can come back to bite you.
[20:55:53] <tolarz> ^
[20:56:46] <piou> relipse: that, mailbox getting hacked, someone on a public wifi intercepting traffic... The connection from your computer to your email provider may be secure, but you don't know what it's like on their end.
[20:57:16] <ajak> ell hopefully you're not sending the email in plaintext so you shouldn't have to worry about wifi traffic interception
[20:57:34] <tolarz> sending encrypted emails is broken too
[20:57:37] <piou> Is that a very probable risk? Not really. But the solution is cheap so many would see no reason to expose yourself to it.
[20:57:40] <tolarz> if you need encryption, don't use emails
[20:58:16] <piou> ajak: truth is, if you're not sending emails in plaintext you're not sending emails to many people

[21:14:32] <piou> Minall: The vendor may have a place (probably on their websites and in changelogs and such) where they talk about vulnerabilities that may not have a CVE number so that's worth checking. Another thing you may check is www.exploit-db.com that lists attack scripts to exploit vulnerabilities. You may find some that exploit vulnerabilities that don't have a CVE number yet, but most do.

[23:50:47] <dodo> or perhaps you can disconnect them
[23:51:14] <REHBhE02qmJNzm6> The actual method to airgap is to remove the actual network cards from the device, and I'd need some sort of RF source to prevent unauthorized hacking through other means?
