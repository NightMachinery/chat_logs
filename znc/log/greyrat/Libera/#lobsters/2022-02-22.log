[13:41:06] <pja> iDrougge: I suspect it’s because of the old copy editing standard that an underlined word in the text should be set in italics in the final print version.
[13:41:53] <pja> Underlining is bad & wrong in that world.
[13:43:14] <iDrougge> Oh, when you had typewritten original copy?
[13:43:25] <pja> (or possibly bold text? Maybe either depending on the individuals concerned - _word_ denoted emphasis is the point & emphasis could be shown typographically in a number of ways, but usually not actually by underlining the final text)
[13:43:52] <pja> iDrougge: yes, exactly. You’d type your text up on an actual typewriter & hammer out underscore to mark emphasised text.

[17:41:46] <JordiGH> Yeah, what's up with webp anyway?
[17:41:53] <JordiGH> Why does Reddit turn everything into a webp?
[17:42:31] <thardin> because they don't know you can crank up jpeg compression
[17:42:54] <JordiGH> webp isn't lossless?
[17:43:05] <thardin> it can be both lossy and lossless I think
[17:43:14] <thardin> BUT

[17:43:52] <thardin> and only 8-bit IIRC
[17:44:38] <thardin> experience from x264 tells us higher bitdepth can yield better compression if your encoder is smart enough
[17:45:54] <thardin> the one innovation in vp8 compared to jpeg is intra prediction. but you kinda get that with hierarchical encoding. if someone (libjpeg) would just implement it

[17:50:28] <wink> time is a flat circle
[17:56:10] <JordiGH> So clickup lets you do "markdown shortcuts".
[17:56:34] <JordiGH> What this means if you try to start typing markdown syntax, it will instantly replace what it recognises as markdown syntax with wysiwyg editing.
[17:56:38] <JordiGH> So you can't actually do markdown.
[17:56:56] <JordiGH> You can do ``` to open a code block but you have to hit C-<RET> to get out of the code block, not ```
[17:57:23] <JordiGH> Why do the people that develop these things hate syntax so much?
[17:57:38] <JordiGH> Even Reddit kind of hides markdown nowadays in its mobile app.
[17:58:41] <thardin> why webshits do the shit they do is an enigma
[18:00:32] <JordiGH> Atlassian does it too.
[18:00:47] <JordiGH> So JIRA had its syntax and Bitbucket had markdown.

[18:43:16] <pushcx> An old coworker has a common first name and is like tylerw@gmail. He says every day he gets mail for other Tylers, some of it sensitive.
[18:44:06] <gwozniak> I have a friend like that.  Always getting email for someone else, often legit that is something he probably shouldn't be seeing
[18:44:55] <feoh> Slack's having a super bad day today. Almost kind of amusing as an old timer watching large chunks of the software industry just MELT into a pile of goo when it's down.
[18:45:12] <feoh> You might think having a centralized SPOF for critical functions like chat was a bad idea :)
[18:46:54] <wink> feoh: only started an hour ago, so "bad day" is still too earluy ;)
[18:47:43] <feoh> pushcx gwozniak: Holy cow me too. I'm cpatti@gmail and I'm like the freaking dead letter room for the internet. All time faves include a dude buying pot seeds online (~15 years ago when that was NOT common here in the US), some poor kids teachers sending me E-mail about how Johnny is having difficulties with the other children in gym, and one
[18:47:43] <feoh> UTTERLY lovelorn dude DESPERATELY trying to get the love of his life back. My wife and I were rolling on the floor reading it.
[18:48:48] <wink> pushcx: I think this would be a fun research topic regarding people's names and their uniqueness, across cultures. I know a (German) guy who relatively often mentions a namesake who keeps signing up with the wrogn (my guy's) email address. can't imagine how bad it would be for typically english or spanish common names, with not only 100m people :P
[18:49:02] <pushcx> I'd like to see email replaced with a similarly federated system but with some kind of handshake to avoid this kind of stuff, and whatever checkbox features will keep banks/doctors happy so I never see another "secure messaging portal" in my life.
[18:50:01] <pushcx> I guess that could be email, but I've worked with some of its protocols at a low level and I'm wary of trying to build on that.

[18:52:21] <mocx> Rather than fix email you should use messaging that eclipses it. There is no way to fix it. I ran a email hosting company for a bit. It’s too embedded in its ways.
[18:52:41] <feoh> gwozniak: I am so hopelessly naive. I miss the early peace, love & Jerry internet :)
[18:52:52] <gwozniak> It's dead and never coming back
[18:53:07] <wink> mocx: the problem is that all messagng apps I saw did not have the features I want
[18:53:34] <wink> mocx: that's the problem in email being so open and so old. a million use cases
[18:53:39] <gwozniak> mocx: yeah, messaging is certainly superior to email these days in terms of experience, in general
[18:53:41] <mocx> Yeah I mean this extensions makes me want to build my own servo browser. I even played with servo last night.  Not sure how dead that project is but seems like that would be the starting point.
[18:54:20] <feoh> Meanwhile people have been saying E-mail is dead for at LEAST 20 years, and here we are all still using it to a greater or lesser extent. It's like Java and COBOL. It will survive the apocalypse and be hanging out among the wreckage with the cockroaches, the Twinkies, and Wall-E :)
[18:54:35] <mocx> Maybe feature complete is better.
[18:55:15] <gwozniak> Email is not dead.  It's just... not that great.
[18:55:25] <gwozniak> It will stick around for a long time.
[18:55:33] <feoh> I get why so many engineers make pronouncements about it. They see very real flaws and deem it unworthy, and that's totally the way it should be. You're crafts-people and it is good and healthy to see the flaws in existing work. But the market has different motivations and doesn't give a rat's posterior about our caviar engineering tastes :)
[18:55:36] <wink> I am all for replacing email with whatever but I have not yet seen a solution to these things: I can host it myself OR let someone (priv/org/company) do it for me + I can sort stuff into folders
[18:55:48] <mocx> I’m starting to think there is a tech 1%. Maybe of elites, maybe not, of people who run Firefox, Linux, etc. the rest are just users without that 1% status.
[18:55:58] <gwozniak> I'm a holdout for email, but my friends don't use it.  Email is a notification engine these days.
[18:56:17] <companion_cube> don't worry, gmail can still manage to kill email
[18:56:32] <companion_cube> (which is useful also for interacting with businesses and such, to be fair)
[18:56:52] <wink> mocx: your categories are too firm. In Germany, some many years ago, Firefox was the de-faco default browsers outside governments and big corps. then chrome came, but it was so much not a nerd toy
[18:56:55] <gwozniak> Hosting something myself is low on the priority list, in general
[18:57:11] <wink> not DOING it but BEING ABLE to
[18:57:29] <wink> I don't want telegram or signal or whathaveyou as a SPOF
[18:57:42] <wink> matrix could be great but it's still more chat than email
[18:58:01] <feoh> mocx: I would invite you to reconsider that idea. Running Linux or not does not make one person elite and the other an unwashed barbarian. I don't run LInux on the desktop because I'm partially blind and, much thought I LOVE Linux, have made my career on it and run it literally EVERYWHERE I can, Linux's accessibility situation is really
[18:58:01] <feoh> problematic.
[18:58:14] <wink> if I could have an email-like client where I could move messages, I'd have no problem if $company sent me messages to my matrix handle
[18:58:15] <gwozniak> Well, the Mastodon instance I use is still a single point of failure for my account
[18:58:32] <wink> you can move though.
[18:58:40] <gwozniak> Yes, but it's work I have to do
[18:58:41] <wink> not preserving history, but keeping you name
[18:58:55] <wink> well I prefer "it is tedious but possible" over "nope,. lol"
[18:58:56] <mocx> Feoh it was mostly a joke, I was trying to allude to the 1% of people on earth control the money meme
[18:59:10] <wink> mocx: we don't control anything though
[18:59:24] <mocx> Yes that’s why I said maybe not elite
[18:59:43] <feoh> mocx: Cool. But there are a LOT of people for whom it's not a joke. They will get SUUUPER uptight at the idea that Linux may not be the ideal solution for everyone. Like burst a blood vessel uptight :)
[19:00:12] <mocx> A lot of people are like that about other software too. So I think the joke is fine.
[19:00:19] <feoh> wink: Yes but we control the top level routes of the internet, and these days that's not nothing :)
[19:00:24] <gwozniak> Tedious but possible is fine.  But it still means most people aren't going to do it.  Most of the time, decentralized systems end up being centralized.  I think having the ability to do it is good, but practically speaking, it's going to be a SPOF
[19:00:32] <feoh> mocx: Absolutely! Wasn't criticizing your joke :)
[19:01:02] <river> wait you can move on mastodon?
[19:01:04] <river> how does that work?
[19:01:09] <mocx> I’ve been looking at ways to contribute to Linux. Improving Accessibility is one of those categories
[19:01:12] <river> is it different to just making a new account ?
[19:01:14] <wink> feoh: I see it more of a problem when people are saying 'ifyou use linux you are crazy, nothing works, etc.pp'
[19:01:36] <river> it's sort of annoying to lose history but if it carries over following and followers that's useful
[19:01:37] <wink> I am not telling anyone to switch to linux, just telling them that it works fine. there are DOZENS of us :P
[19:01:37] <feoh> Absolutes where tools are concerned should be considered a straight up anti-pattern
[19:02:17] <companion_cube> feoh: turns out linux was for most people… under the android layer
[19:02:29] <feoh> wink: Totally agree. If you don't have any disabilities and control & privacy are top priorities for you, you can't beat UNIX on the desktop.
[19:02:33] <river> MINIX is actually the most popular OS
[19:03:17] <feoh> companion_cube: I mean, sure, in the same way that the Mach micro-kernel is for everyone because MacOS X runs it under the covers, and FreeBSD is for everyone because it usese that userland. It all gets a smidge silly when push comes to shove :)
[19:03:20] <mocx> Most of the stuff I saw was on HN where people would hijack any Linux thread to post why they just couldn’t switch from MacOS. Well good for you but the thread isn’t about Apple. If you responded with Apple criticism or how Apple just wasn’t for you, then the pundits would downvote you into oblivion. Very biased crowd over there.
[19:03:24] <feoh> river: Good point!
[19:03:30] <feoh> I still have a soft spot for MINIX.

But it took 2 years and a ton of lobbying, and Gnome is such an insanely complex ball of C abstractions that only a handful of people on planet earth had the chops to be able to fix it, and they're

[19:20:16] <mocx> Sure that makes sense. I’ve heard criticisms but I’m also probably not a high target for theft.
[19:21:05] <feoh> I actually run Arch in a spare disk on my desktop. I love it but I also consider it like a mad scientist's lab where anything could explode at any moment when I update so I never rely on it. This says more about ME than about IT :)

[19:59:26] <mocx> Reminds me at work we have a library called testing-user to help automate users into a testable state. Terrible name because no one knows whether you’re talking about testing users in general or the library
[19:59:55] <carbolymer> appropriate amount of confusion imo
[19:59:56] <technomancy> that's why you always name your libraries after obscure fictional characters amirite
[20:00:43] <blu> name it after birds in the corvid family
[20:00:56] <mocx> Comparatively the automation software that runs testing-user is called pool-party which is a better way to go about names IMO
[20:03:40] *** Quits: ka80 (~ka80@user/ka80) (Quit: Leaving)
[20:04:06] <carbolymer> mocx: and when it fails it sends an e-mail, "pool's closed" ?
[20:04:40] <blu> carbolymer: have you used jellyfin or just know about it?
[20:04:48] <carbolymer> blu: I'm using it
[20:05:38] <blu> Have you used plex before, it looks neat but using plex currently and dont have many complaints.
[20:05:40] <feoh> Jellyfin is indeed cool and new, but doesn't have clients for a bunch of devices yet where Plex does
[20:05:53] <mocx> When it fails all the engineers freak out because the automation tests stop running. Probably similar to when kids freak out that the pool is closed.
[20:06:33] <feoh> That said Plex has been annoying the CRAP out of me by introducing new features that BREAK and stay broken forever while they chase the latest new shiny thing that most of us traditional Plex users who just wanna serve our media could care less about, so I look forward to the day when I can replace it.
[20:06:44] <feoh> Like, they added Podcasts, and it was Good.
[20:07:01] <carbolymer> blu: I'm using both actually, I haven't decided which should I leave, tbh my biggest complaint is that you can't adjust subtitles in neither of them... so vlc wins for now
[20:07:01] <feoh> But they now have a forum with like 9000 posts from folks saying it's broken and ... crickets from Plex.
[20:07:16] <carbolymer> blu: and hardware encoding without plex pass works in jellyfin
[20:07:22] <feoh> It's exactly what FLOSS advocates fear when a company goes commercial. They forget their raison d'etre.
[20:08:06] <blu> yeah it looks like jellyfin doesnt support my tv which is kind of a pain, I would like a different tv but hard to find an non smart tv.
[20:08:17] <feoh> carbolymer: Lots of advantages IMO to VLC. I think it can also play raw ISO images too right? That feels like an even superior approach to all the ripping hoo hah.
[20:08:34] <carbolymer> nice

[20:10:04] <feoh> Not everyone can go that route though
[20:10:10] * carbolymer does not have enought space between teeth to floss

[21:44:45] <shapr> I prefer laptops that have ethernet on board.
[21:44:57] <shapr> feoh: what model of new thinkpad?
[21:45:01] <JordiGH> kline: Yeah.
[21:45:07] <feoh> shapr: T15 gen2
[21:45:09] <kline> JordiGH, you're using monterey
[21:45:10] <shapr> ah
[21:45:18] <JordiGH> kline: Is that legal advice?
[21:45:37] <shapr> My P52 is much beefier than either of my work macs, 2019 intel or 2021 m1
[21:45:38] <JordiGH> The back label on the box makes it clear I have to agree to the license. It says it in several different languages.
[21:45:46] <kline> JordiGH, its the OS that apple say is on it: https://support.apple.com/kb/SP854?locale=en_US
[21:45:46] <mockturtle> [ MacBook Pro (14-inch, 2021) - Technical Specifications ] - support.apple.com
[21:45:48] <feoh> shapr: Love it. Great little lappie. Two thumbs up. Only issue is the screen blows in direct sunlight. Other than that? Amazing little beastie. Great keyboard. Nice perf. Great ergo. GREAT batterry life.
[21:45:50] <shapr> I'm thinking of upgrading to the latest P15
[21:46:00] <JordiGH> What fucking license? Why can't you just show me the license instead of pointing a link to an ambiguous list of licenses?
[21:46:05] <shapr> feoh: oh, I have terrible battery life but everything else is great.
[21:46:23] <feoh> I like working away from the plug too much :)
[21:46:28] <shapr> maybe I should try that
[21:46:29] <feoh>  Like outside, on the terrace
[21:46:40] <shapr> I mean, I get four hours of battery life if I'm not compiling anything
[21:46:42] <kline> JordiGH, its the monterey license
[21:46:46] <feoh> or sitting at meet-ups or tech conference (remember those?) and not having to panic over my battery
[21:46:50] <JordiGH> kline: Is that saying it's actually using Monterey or is it just an unrelated marketing pitch for how I should install Monterey on it?
[21:46:57] <shapr> almost an hour if I'm doing full-tilt compiling using all the cores.
[21:47:02] <feoh> shapr: I seriously get close to 12 for light work on my T15 gen2
[21:47:05] <shapr> wow, nice
[21:47:10] <feoh> shapr: 8 for heavier work.
[21:47:22] <JordiGH> kline: That reads like "macOS is great. Oh, pizza is great too."
[21:47:26] <shapr> on the other hand, I have three batteries that are easy to swap
[21:47:38] <shapr> so I can get twelve hours of battery life if I don't mind swapping batteries.
[21:47:45] <feoh> That's an awfully nice feature for sure
[21:47:54] <feoh> The T15 does NOT have removable battery
[21:48:02] <JordiGH> I can't even. I'm closing this thing and cogitating on how to accept a license that isn't being shown to me.
[21:48:02] <kline> JordiGH, stop being precious about the delivery format. the page says that your part number comes with monterey. if you have an issue with that you should head to the local apple store for further advice
[21:48:07] <cb> i get ~7-8 hours battery life on my m1 air with no fucking around - wifi and bluetooth on, max brightness, just working normally
[21:48:11] <cb> not bad for a fanless 13" ultralighjt
[21:48:20] <JordiGH> kline: Y'know what, I think I will.
[21:48:21] <feoh> and also note I get 12 hours of battery because I'm running Windows. I KNOW I wouldn't come close to that with Linux, even if I did the TPI or whatever it's called dance :)
[21:48:27] <Xe> morning
[21:48:35] <JordiGH> kline: I'd love to see a genius show me how to find the correct license to agree to.
[21:48:58] <kline> JordiGH, theyre going to do what i did: look up the part number, arrive at the model page, which specifies it comes with monterey
[21:49:01] <shapr> cb: for whatever reason both the 2019 intel and 2021 m1 can't keep full charge and do compile forever at the same time. I have to stop compiling and give them breaks to recharge the battery.
[21:49:07] <kline> https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/macOSMonterey.pdf
[21:49:14] <JordiGH> kline: and then tell me it's legal advice that it's the only one I have to agree to?

[21:49:29] <feoh> She only charges it every few weeks with light use
[21:49:34] <feoh> She LOVES it
[21:49:59] <kline> JordiGH, why do you need legal advice for this?
[21:50:05] <feoh> And the keyboards even are no longer god awful! *stares balefully at the 2017 MBP on the desk - work laptop :)
[21:50:07] <JordiGH> kline: Because I'm being asked to make a legal decision.
[21:50:31] <kline> JordiGH, do you normally seek legal advice for each and every software product you use?
[21:50:37] <JordiGH> I normally read the license.
[21:50:44] <JordiGH> I can't even read this license because they won't show it to me!

[21:51:22] <JordiGH> It's the one YOU said.
[21:51:26] <JordiGH> They said "go here"
[21:51:29] <cb> mac os 12 was the launch OS for the 14" mbp
[21:51:31] <JordiGH> And "here" doesn't specify which one they meant.
[21:51:34] <cb> and it's the current OS version
[21:51:35] <kline> JordiGH, look up the part number, visit the page for it, ezpz
[21:51:42] <feoh> IMO that Southpark episode says EVERYTHING you need to know about Apple and clickwrap licenses :)
[21:52:05] <JordiGH> kline: Any reasonable person would instantly know that "the software" meant the OS only and that's the only license that requires agreeing to?
[21:52:07] <kline> JordiGH, i dont know why you have adopted this learned helplessness because you dont have the document on your screen, im sure its not beyond you
[21:52:20] <JordiGH> (Not sure if copyright law uses "any reasonable person", I think that's more of a trademark term of art.)
[21:52:23] <kline> JordiGH, have you looked at the license?
[21:52:31] <JordiGH> Yeah, the one you showed me.
[21:52:36] <JordiGH> Not sure that's the only one I have to read.
[21:52:41] <kline> have you read it?
[21:52:44] <kline> perhaps it answers you
[21:53:04] <JordiGH> Okay, that'll shut me up for a while. It's 17 pages for the English part. BBL.

[21:54:17] <feoh> I love Apple hardware (own a TON of it) but you just have to know that you're buying in to Apple as a corporate platform
[21:54:48] <feoh> For instance if you use Airplay you're creating a loopback device into Apple's network
[21:55:11] <kline> feoh, just put linux on it or something
[21:55:18] <feoh> I certainly don't care for my own personal stuff but my employer REALLY does :)
[21:55:19] <tarzeau> feoh: how so?
[21:55:28] <tarzeau> feoh: have you seen uxplay yet? airplay with source
[21:58:59] <JordiGH> Huh, weird, the license only grants you permission to use software from the app store in older versions of macOS, not in Monterey?
[21:59:13] <JordiGH> The bigSur license also lists all prior versions but not bigSur
[21:59:25] <feoh> tarzeau: I can't find any documentary evidence, but here's why I know that - when you get a Mac from Amazon, it has Airplay turned off at the kernel level. You CAN'T enable it. The reason given is as I said above, that when you use Airplay it creates a loopback device on Apple's network.
[21:59:30] <wink> I'd say you're overthinking it, for a work laptop
[21:59:34] <JordiGH> So the apple store is not for the current version of macOS?
[22:00:01] <kline> its for monterey in addition to app store stuff from previous versions

[22:01:18] <tarzeau> feoh: unlike some google and other homekit like devices
[22:01:27] <ngoldbaum> yeah if you type three periods apple’s keyboard replaces it with an ellipsis and you can’t turn that off
[22:01:30] <JordiGH> God this is formatted so weirdly. Why is there no newline before 2(iii)?
[22:01:39] <tarzeau> ngoldbaum: you sure can!
[22:01:41] <JordiGH> kline: Where are you reading that it's allowed for Monterey?
[22:02:17] <kline> JordiGH, you're looking at 2Bi, yeah?
[22:02:17] <JordiGH> 2B(iii) I mean
[22:02:24] <JordiGH> kline: Yeah.
[22:02:38] <kline> compare and contrast with 2A
[22:03:03] <feoh> tarzeau: Sadly I've got nothing :) I can't even find the internal wiki page that justifies its disabled status, but I can tell you that Airplay is perma-set to Off in my Amazon issued Mac 🤷
[22:03:13] <ngoldbaum> shapr: which bone conduction headphones do you have? i’m looking at the aftershokz aeropex
[22:03:31] <JordiGH> kline: Right, so 2A says it's a different situation for the McStore, no? And 2B only lists prior versions of macOS.
[22:03:51] <kline> JordiGH, are you suggesting that you are installing monterey from the mac store on a non-mac os?
[22:03:56] <tarzeau> feoh: no idea amazon doesn't exist in .ch, i only order from next.com
[22:04:19] <tarzeau> btw https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay
[22:04:20] <mockturtle> [ GitHub - FDH2/UxPlay: AirPlay Unix mirroring server ] - github.com
[22:04:21] <feoh> Amazon is a lot bigger than retail my friend :)
[22:04:28] <JordiGH> kline: The terms apply to "Apple software", which as defined in 1A includes a lot more than just the OS.
[22:04:39] <feoh> tarzeau: Good to know about, thanks!
[22:04:43] <tarzeau> feoh: they don't ship in .ch, so they're tiny if non-existant for me, sorry
[22:04:54] <kline> JordiGH, 2A and B are mutually exclusive. 2A sets out conditions for the bundle if you got a single use license or pre-installed, otherwise use 2B
[22:05:11] <kline> JordiGH, no, 1A clearly sets out what is covered in the license
[22:05:18] <feoh> tarzeau: Cool wasn't arguing with you :)
[22:05:21] <kline> yes, its more than just the OS
[22:05:25] <kline> this isnt just the OS license
[22:05:32] <JordiGH> Right, but 2B doesn't let you use Apple Software on the current version of the OS.
[22:05:41] <tarzeau> unless they get their awscli 1.x and 2.x fixed, they're nothing! (sorry for speaking like theiraqinformationminister)
[22:05:51] <kline> JordiGH, 2B applies to if you are installing from the app store. are you?
[22:05:59] <JordiGH> idk, I might? Isn't that people do?
[22:06:02] <JordiGH> Buy shit from Apple?
[22:06:13] <kline> JordiGH, did this OS come preinstalled?
[22:06:14] <JordiGH> I wanna be like common people. Do whatever common people do.
[22:06:30] <feoh> tarzeau: :)
[22:06:37] <feoh> You can speak any way you like in my book!
[22:06:50] <tarzeau> i'm happy with my below 1000$ mba spacegray, waiting for asahi linux
[22:06:52] <JordiGH> kline: I assume the OS came preinstalled.
[22:06:56] <feoh> JordiGH: In that case stop reading. Click. Drool. Enjoy the pretty colors :)
[22:07:55] <kline> JordiGH, i know youre more about code than anything else but this isnt a particularly difficult bit of the license to read
[22:08:04] <ngoldbaum> i believe every other human ever clicks agree without reading it because literally none of the eula matter at all in any practical sense for you an individual person
[22:08:36] <gwozniak> Yeah
[22:08:40] <kline> JordiGH, parts 2A and 2B are mutually exclusive, you cannot have it both preinstalled on the laptop and also be installing monterey as an upgrade from big sur
[22:08:46] <kline> "but i dont know if its just the OS"
[22:09:02] <kline> this isnt just the os license, part 1A clearly says it applies to the whole bundle
[22:09:24] <kline> and other parts of the license confirm that, including open source elements that may be bundled
[22:09:36] <JordiGH> kline: But this license doesn't just cover what's preinstalled. So if I install new things, which can be things other than the OS, this license doesn't say I can use those things on this OS.
[22:09:51] <JordiGH> "Synchronizing photos with the Photos App and any Apple or third party services may result in loss of data."
[22:09:53] <JordiGH> wat
[22:10:00] <JordiGH> So using the software can delete your data?
[22:10:00] <kline> thats correct, but they will have their own license agreements down the line
[22:10:03] <kline> yes
[22:10:19] <JordiGH> Okay, so I shouldn't use it.

[22:11:29] <kline> likewise, if you delete something from your synced cloud storage, and it then deletes the same thing from your laptop, is that such a surprise? but is it data loss?

[22:11:46] <kline> this is an end run around people saying "i didnt know i could delete everything by accident"
[22:11:55] <JordiGH> kline: This doesn't waive all warranty, though.
[22:12:02] <JordiGH> At least that particular line doesn't.
[22:12:05] <river> I dont really understand this 'boot2qt' thing
[22:12:08] <JordiGH> It just says the software will regularly destroy my data.
[22:12:11] <river> why is there anything qt specific here
[22:12:16] <JordiGH> Well, might destroy my data.
[22:12:20] <river> a qt program is just a regular program
[22:12:24] <kline> JordiGH, correct
[22:12:25] <JordiGH> It's such a weird throw-off line.
[22:12:59] <kline> its just legal defence in depth
[22:13:14] <JordiGH> I mean, "lifting this laptop my break your back"
[22:13:18] <JordiGH> Sure, if you're really weak.
[22:13:22] <JordiGH> So why not add that particular line?
[22:13:52] <kline> because people dont really understand software intuitively and will reach for legal remedy while being wrong
[22:13:59] <kline> this is an attempt to avert those cases
[22:15:46] <JordiGH> It's such a weird thing to admit that this particular feature of the software could destroy your data.
[22:15:59] <JordiGH> It doesn't even say "improper use" or something.
[22:16:10] <JordiGH> It just says plain synching, which I assume is a normal feature, can destroy your data.

[22:16:34] <JordiGH> So even if you used it correctly and it destroys your data, it's your fault, not Apple's.
[22:17:16] <kline> i mean, if you ask it to destroy your data, sure
[22:17:22] <kline> theres nothing in here about intent

[22:22:19] <JordiGH> kline: You inferred one, but "the software" was vague enough that it could have been any of the other licenses.
[22:22:29] <JordiGH> I really disagree that's what I'm agreeing to.
[22:22:38] <kline> thats ok, but youre wrong
[22:22:44] <JordiGH> You had to read marketing materials to deduce that.
[22:23:03] <JordiGH> I was given no instruction on what "the software" referred to.
[22:23:09] <kline> ok
[22:23:12] <kline> well, argue it in court
[22:23:18] <ngoldbaum> shapr: why those over the aeropex?
[22:23:33] <kline> youll lose, let me know when the transcript is there so i can laugh at it
[22:23:47] <JordiGH> So look like "Cahcing enabled mac" sends all sorts of information to Apple, huh.
[22:23:58] <JordiGH> Is that what you have to disable to stop talking to the mothership?
[22:26:19] <JordiGH> Huh this is weird.
[22:27:48] <JordiGH> There are restrictions on how you can rdesktop into macOS.
[22:28:07] <JordiGH> Only one device at a time is allowed to control the rdesktop thing.
[22:28:28] <JordiGH> So if you have a home and a work one and you accidentally make both control the GUI at the same time, that's a license violation.
[22:29:41] <kline> probably not
[22:29:46] <blu> What no its not.
[22:30:04] <kline> generally doing something accidentally and stopping immediately with not further harm is not generally a violation
[22:30:30] <kline> that theyre trying to avoid here is buying only 1 machine and sharing it between 10 coworkers, each sharing it

[22:31:01] <JordiGH> But this says "device".
[22:31:02] <shapr> ngoldbaum: OpenSwim are ear-mounted music player, not bluetooth. They also play FLAC. After the fall of Google Play I couldn't find a good replacement, so switched to buying music on bandcamp or ripping CDs.
[22:31:11] <JordiGH> If two devices connect and both are controlling the thing, that's a violation.
[22:31:12] <shapr> ngoldbaum: also, surprisingly fun to listen to music in the shower
[22:31:20] <ngoldbaum> ahhhh i see
[22:31:25] <ngoldbaum> i want bluetooth
[22:31:31] <shapr> but in general, I just don't make phone calls
[22:31:52] <JordiGH> blu: This says device, not users. If you happen to be the same user but using two devices to rdesktopping into the macOS GUI, that's not allowed according to the license.
[22:32:05] <ngoldbaum> i have airpod pros right now that are breaking and they aren’t really supposed to be used when you’re sweaty anyway
[22:32:27] <shapr> breaking?
[22:32:38] <ngoldbaum> plus the passthrough mode only works if there isn’t a lot of background noise (e.g. any wind) so the bone conduction is almost certainly safer
[22:33:04] <JordiGH> kline: I mean, whether Apple is able to successfully prosecute someone who has two devices controlling the GUI remotely is a different matter. But the license clearly says devices, not users.
[22:33:05] <kline> JordiGH, thats right, you cant use multiple devices with the same user to control the device via rdesktop
[22:33:10] <ngoldbaum> the microphone comes unglued apparently? it’s a reasonably common fault, googling
[22:33:16] <shapr> Oh good point, my sweat kills most headphones in short order. Shokz have never had that problem.
[22:33:21] <kline> JordiGH, i dont see what the problem is here
[22:33:29] <shapr> ngoldbaum: passthrough? what does that do?
[22:33:36] <ngoldbaum> it introduces a rattling noise or high frequency noises if you have noise cancellation turned on
[22:33:47] <JordiGH> kline: idk, wouldn't someone reasonably want to graphically control their machine from two different locations at once?
[22:34:16] <kline> maybe, but its not permitted
[22:34:23] <ngoldbaum> shapr: the airpod pros have a noise cancellation mode and a passthrough mode which just lets the exterior audio in through the headphones instead of cancelling it
[22:34:33] <shapr> oh interesting
[22:34:39] <shapr> I think bone conduction is a better approach for that.
[22:34:51] <kline> JordiGH, this presumably stops me putting one mac in a datacentre and then using it as a server for all my other devices
[22:35:06] <ngoldbaum> yeah agreed it’s not great
[22:35:07] <JordiGH> kline: No, that's fine. it's the GUI that's expressly forbidden.

[22:35:37] <ngoldbaum> which is 99% of what i do
[22:35:38] <shapr> ngoldbaum: I started with shokz because I want to cycle while hearing danger around me and still hearing music. they're great for that.
[22:35:48] <JordiGH> Interesting, 250 USD is Apple's maximum liability, unless a law compells them otherwise.
[22:37:03] <shapr> ngoldbaum: For that, I do think aeropex are a good choice. If you end up with a pair I can dump you a much longer critique of good and bad points.
[22:38:36] <ngoldbaum> yeah i bought a pair that i can return if i don’t like
[22:38:48] <ngoldbaum> will have to wait a few days to try them outside
[22:38:53] <ngoldbaum> currently hoth out there

[23:10:19] <shapr> ngoldbaum: I recommend wearing them around the house. When I went outside consistently, I just always had them on my ears.
[23:10:43] <shapr> I had to switch to a sporty blue for the most recent pair, because people who noticed them thought it was a classy hearing aid.
[23:10:50] <JordiGH> Wow, macOS won't even let you install without wifi.
[23:11:07] <technomancy> JordiGH: so I'm not going to Apple Jail for connecting over SSH from multiple machines?
[23:11:11] <JordiGH> Ah, that's because it's gonna be provisioned remotely by New Relic.
[23:11:15] <technomancy> as long as I don't do any X forwarding I guess?
[23:12:27] <JordiGH> technomancy: Yeah, that's what the license says.
[23:13:55] <JordiGH> Ah, interesting, yes, this came pre-installed with spyware.

[23:14:20] <JordiGH> So that's why it's gotta be all mac.
[23:14:33] <technomancy> just toss a vbox on it; it's tolerable
[23:15:32] <technomancy> just be prepared to have to uninstall and reinstall virtualbox every time a new OS update is forced on you. It Just Works™
[23:17:22] <cb> i find vbox never worked well but i've always used it on windows
[23:18:07] <wink> technomancy[m]: the reinstall thing also happens on linux :P
[23:18:12] <technomancy> there's a lot of shit that's really stupid about it but it's mostly around the initial setup; once that's done you can kind of forget it exists
[23:18:20] <technomancy> wink: wait why would you use virtualbox on linux?
[23:18:32] <technomancy> why would anyone use an oracle product unless there was no other choice?
[23:19:49] <gwozniak> JordiGH: I've never seen a New Relic login on macOS before.  Is this provisioned by your employer?  Mine has Carbon Black on it, for example.
[23:20:03] <JordiGH> gwozniak: Yeah, it's provisioned by them.
[23:20:10] <gwozniak> But that's only because my employer requires it
[23:20:10] <JordiGH> My new employer, New Relic.
[23:20:30] <JordiGH> technomancy: I think I'm gonna need it anyway for Docker?
[23:21:38] <technomancy> JordiGH: hm; I thought docker for mac used a different virtualization thingy? anyway skip docker for mac, it sucks. just use docker in vbox.
[23:21:39] <wink> technomancy[m]: not nopw, but 2 companies ago it made sense. we had a bespoke vagrant setup for everthign and all the others had a mac. so it was either: rebuild every single "box" for myself, or use vbox
[23:21:52] <JordiGH> I guess I'll have to wait until next week when I get a company login and then I can use this laptop.
[23:22:06] <technomancy> wink: oh yeah, I remember vagrant. takes me back.
[23:22:14] <JordiGH> technomancy: Not sure which Docker I can use, maybe I'll be forced to use the mac one.
[23:22:26] <technomancy> JordiGH: there is no mac one =P

[23:23:16] <technomancy> I mean, maybe they'd require it but it seems really unlikely.
[23:23:31] <JordiGH> I mean, whatever "docker for mac" is.
[23:25:47] <technomancy> that would be pretty hilarious tbh

[23:59:46] <JordiGH> Three given names, three family names, or patronymics or how do names work for your culture?
