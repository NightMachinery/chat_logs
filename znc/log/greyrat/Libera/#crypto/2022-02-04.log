[00:39:01] <sshine> Jmabsd, finite fields need inverse elements
[00:39:17] <Jmabsd> sshine: oh. uh. why?
[00:40:18] <sshine> Jmabsd, https://youtu.be/FCczHiXPVcA?t=298 :)
[00:42:52] <maroon> Jmabsd, finite field means something like diffie-hellman?
[00:42:54] <sshine> Jmabsd, so in Z_6, 2 does not have an inverse, i.e. 1/2 is not a member of Z_6. that means division won't work. you may want for division to work.
[00:43:28] <sshine> maroon, do you know what a group is?
[00:43:42] <Jmabsd> maroon: nope
[00:43:59] <maroon> it's all the outputs than can result from cycling through all the inputs
[00:43:59] *** Sofia_ is now known as Sofia
[00:44:23] <sshine> Jmabsd, I have a bunch of algorithms that work on finite fields. some of them use division. if I wasn't in a finite field, that division would throw up at random whenever I bump into something where division has no solution within the field.
[00:44:40] <sshine> maroon, yeah, with one operator, e.g. + or *
[00:45:01] <sshine> maroon, a field is kind of like that, except you can cycle through with both + and *
[00:45:46] <sshine> maroon, also, "cycle through" implies you're talking about finite (cyclical) groups. but that's ok you assume, since we're after all computer geeks, and it's a lot easier to deal with finity on computers :P
[00:45:50] <Jmabsd> sshine: what's your point about the division throwing up random?
[00:47:34] <maroon> how about altering 2^8 so that it can have all 256 values having an inverse by doing this: 1) if number is odd, calculcate inverse normally. 2) if number is even, then calc inverse(n+1), and subtract 1 from that result. this ends up at another even number
[00:47:55] <sshine> Jmabsd, I just gave an example. let's say I'm using Z_6 for my algorithms, so modular arithmetic on {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. and let's say I'm doing the inverse NTT (number-theoretic transform) on some input. that involves calculating 1/len(arr). let's say len(arr) = 2. then 1/len(arr) is not a member of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. at this point, I close my computer down and go outside, because I lost.
[00:50:43] <sshine> Jmabsd, you asked why finite fields can't have size 2^8. because they're defined in such a way that requires them to have an order that is a power of some prime, but not a composition of primes. and the reason why that is, is to that all the operators work. if it were programming you'd say the functions can't be partial, i.e. none of them can throw exceptions, there's always a solution to every +, -, *, / 
[00:50:50] <sshine> operation.
[00:53:16] <Jmabsd> sshine: if all you need is + and * , is size 2^8 ok then?
[00:53:48] <maroon> inverse multiply mod 2^8 means none of your even numbers will have an inverse, so you can't *
[00:54:15] <sshine> Jmabsd, yes, but then it's called a finite ring
[00:55:26] <sshine> Jmabsd, there are lots of useful applications of those
[00:56:44] <Jmabsd> sshine: a 2^8 size finite field that permits only + and * = a "finite ring"?
[00:56:56] <sshine> Jmabsd, it wouldn't be a finite field.
[00:57:01] <Jmabsd> sshine: just curious, do you know Reid Solomon error correcting codes
[00:57:09] <aweinstock> if you need a field of 2^8 elements, you can use GF(2^8), but + and * aren't the usual integer + and *
[00:57:33] <sshine> Jmabsd, not yet :) they're on my task list for Feb.
[00:57:36] <Jmabsd> aweinstock: instead the + and * will do what?
[00:57:39] <Jmabsd> sshine: cool

[00:58:58] <maroon> is gf(2^8) what crypto uses when it mixes a series of add's and xor's together?
[01:00:39] *** Quits: dude12312414 (~test@gateway/tor-sasl/dude12312414) (Quit: THE RAM IS TOO DAMN HIGH)
[01:00:52] <aweinstock> I think + is bitwise xor in GF(2^k), and multiplication takes the bits as coefficients of a polynomial, multiplies the polynomial, and then reduces modulo some fixed irreducible polynomial
[01:00:56] <aweinstock> (e.g. https://github.com/RPISEC/HackTheVote/blob/master/2020/crypto/sbfos/sol/azure_sol.py#L21-L30)
[01:04:10] <maroon> hrm, im not seeing addition being a bitwise xor. i.e. in 2^8, 0xff + 0x01 = 0x00
[01:05:10] <Jmabsd> aweinstock,maroon: do you understand reid solomon error correcting codes
[01:05:47] <maroon> no, i think those are used in quick.par files right?
[01:06:55] <aweinstock> maroon: GF(2^k), not Z_{2^k}
[01:08:28] <MacGyver> maroon: Elements in GF(2^k) can be thought of as polynomials of degree < k over GF(2)
[01:09:22] <maroon> that sounds a little like a crc's polynomial?
[01:09:32] <MacGyver> maroon: And because those are polynomials in GF(2), the coefficients can only be 0 and 1.
[01:09:52] <MacGyver> maroon: Adding two polynomials of that type is effectively xor over binary numbers.
[01:10:34] <MacGyver> maroon: So an element in GF(2^8)? That's just a byte.
[01:11:02] <Jmabsd> macgyver: do you know reid solmon error correcting codes :)
[01:11:02] <MacGyver> maroon: And the bits in that byte represent the coefficients of 0 * x^0 + 1 * x^1 + 0 * x^2 etc.
[01:12:13] <aweinstock> Jmabsd: I think https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction#Systematic_encoding_procedure:_The_message_as_an_initial_sequence_of_values is the presentation I find most familiar
[01:12:20] <MacGyver> Jmabsd: I know the term but I've never gotten into the mathematics of error correction beyond basic parities.
[01:12:45] <aweinstock> it's basically the same technique as shamir's secret sharing, but for the case where you have more points than the degree of the polynomal instead of fewer points

[06:27:02] <danieldg> ... actually I think for 2-prime rsa they are provably equivalent
[06:30:09] <sshine> danieldg, oh, right, sqrt(n) = n^(1/2), and 1/2 is just 2^-1, i.e. 2's inverse.
[06:30:39] <danieldg> yep
[06:30:43] <halosghost> sshine: I love math
[06:33:27] <sshine> that is, 2's multiplicative inverse :P
[06:34:11] <sshine> halosghost, is it work related?
[06:34:28] <halosghost> sshine: in that I'm doing more work with cryptography now, sure
[06:34:55] <halosghost> but more specifically, I'm working through cryptohack as one of many resources to help me try to expand my knowledge-base
[06:36:13] <halosghost> also, for the moment, I'm just using gmp, but I should probably switch to using libsodium soon
[06:36:18] <halosghost> (hence my commentary above ☺)
[06:39:43] <TimMc> sshine: Oh right, some things get easier in discrete. :-D
[07:07:42] <sshine> halosghost, what's cryptohack?
[07:09:38] <halosghost> sshine: it's a CTF meant to help learn working with cryptography (linked in the Resources gist in the topic)
[07:10:07] <halosghost> (similar to cryptopals (which is also linked), though a little more hand-holdy and a little more gamified)

[15:38:57] <SlimmyJimmy> I literally pulled 512 bytes as the hash from one of my TCs.

[15:41:27] <SlimmyJimmy> I'm not sure why it is so hard to find this information.
[15:42:13] <maroon> well, my opinion is that until you can get the program to 'find' the key when you set it to a known value, you can't trust that you've unknowingly had the program zoom past the true key as a false negative
[15:42:41] *** Joins: gildasio (~gildasio@gateway/tor-sasl/gildasio)
[15:45:03] <SlimmyJimmy> It's a little bit more complex that that though. There are about 36 different ways to try to crack a TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt password.
[15:45:57] <SlimmyJimmy> I don't even remember what encryption methods I used and I don't think either TrueCrypt or VeraCrypt gives that information even on an unlocked container.
[15:46:11] <SlimmyJimmy> That's the part that is going a little over the top in my opinion.
[15:46:48] <SlimmyJimmy> So, you literally have to write all this down or remember it as you create your containers. So, it's a lesson learned for me.
[15:46:50] <maroon> from a security point that's good - when failing to login to a system, it should not confirm whether the accountname is even valid or not
[15:47:07] <SlimmyJimmy> true, I hate websites that do that though to be honest. :)
[15:47:13] <wasamasa> wild hypothesis coming from a windows user without the appropriate tools at hand to disprove it
[15:47:22] <SlimmyJimmy> Some of them actually do acknowledge whether the email is valid or not.
[15:47:25] <SlimmyJimmy> To this day
[15:48:15] <wasamasa> the information what algorithm to use to unlock/verify the container must be somewhere
[15:48:31] <maroon> for the person who already knows what their accountname is, indicating that the password is incorrect for a valid account, that just tells the bad guy they've found a valid target
[15:48:52] <SlimmyJimmy> I don't think so, I think I read somewhere that TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt literally goes through all the possibilities 1 by 1 as it attempts to open your containers.
[15:49:08] <SlimmyJimmy> But it doesn't reveal which method was used once it decrypts your container.
[15:49:42] <wasamasa> besides, even if that were true
[15:49:47] <SlimmyJimmy> maroon agreed, I get the reasons for it, but it makes harder on people who are stupid like me and just forget their username/passes
[15:49:49] <wasamasa> you mentioned you created a test container
[15:49:54] <wasamasa> and still couldn't crack it
[15:50:12] <wasamasa> you must be doing something fundamentally wrong
[15:50:58] <SlimmyJimmy> Oh, no, I have a container that i "haven't" forget the password on like a dummy, I can't even get that password cracked yet. You're right. Something is off and maybe the hash I'm supplying is too big. I'm going to find out whether its 512 bytes or bits. That may matter a lot.
[15:51:12] <maroon> i agree with wasamasa, that was what i was referring to when you need to have a success first
[15:51:20] <wasamasa> I linked you the code used by the method you've selected
[15:52:10] <SlimmyJimmy> Which one do I pick if I don't remember? : https://i.imgur.com/dwe1frn.png
[15:52:41] <wasamasa> start all over again and pay attention to the options you choose when creating the test container
[15:52:57] <wasamasa> if you don't choose any, start with choosing them
[15:53:06] <maroon> how many possible combos are there?
[15:53:10] <sshine> halosghost, thanks for the link to finding square roots.
[15:53:14] <SlimmyJimmy> That's my only options? But that implies accepting the loss of my locked containers.
[15:53:27] <maroon> i'd think if you used streebog you'd have remembered
[15:53:28] <wasamasa> RIPEMD is a pretty funny choice anyway
[15:54:09] <SlimmyJimmy> I used a mix of stuff. All swirled into one, like neopolitan ice-cream. That one sounded fun to me. But I don't which 3. I think something about a fish and the whirpool.
[15:54:10] <SlimmyJimmy> :)
[15:54:37] <maroon> as i remember, ripemd was big in the 80s, but died when SHA1 came out
[15:54:51] <wasamasa> like, who the fuck uses that, other than clueless cryptocurrency morons
[15:54:57] <SlimmyJimmy> AES(Whirlpool(something else)))
[15:59:43] <maroon> this image is just the hashes, does the list of ciphers also include some 'legacy' ciphers?
[16:01:07] <maroon> like RC5 Blowfish IDEA XTEA
[16:01:45] <maroon> oh and 3DES
[16:02:41] <SlimmyJimmy> Yes Blowfish, I wonder why it's not in the listing at all. I think I used that one also, so it was AES(Blowfish(Whirlpool)))
[16:03:35] <maroon> this image makes zero mention of cipher - not even AES, maybe that's on another page
[16:05:25] <SlimmyJimmy> I matched every truecrypt and veracrypt occurence using the --help screen.

[17:13:50] <SlimmyJimmy> It's hard to find actually, I tried searching scientists math bug flaw intel but there are so many flaws it seems each year they discover.
[17:15:28] <SlimmyJimmy> Found a really old one: https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-11-24-fi-1177-story.html
[17:18:49] <SlimmyJimmy> Yep, this is the one I was talking about, I'm pretty sure because of this sentence in the article: "Yet the company chose not to disclose the problem to customers, a spokesman said Wednesday, because it viewed as minuscule the chance that anyone other than an advanced research scientist would ever encounter it."
[17:18:52] <maroon> not looking at the link, it's probably the f00f gpf bug
[17:19:09] <maroon> intel had to send people new chips for that one
[17:19:52] <SlimmyJimmy> In other words, "We're not gonna talk about it because it's so arcane or niche.". That's not how I would approach it. But it probably costs them millions of dollars to remedy the problem at the time. I don't know.
[17:19:53] <maroon> so they'd send you a 'free' replacement chip, but would bill you for it if you didn't return the bug chip
[17:20:14] <SlimmyJimmy> Makes sense to try and hide it from the public then.
[17:20:45] <maroon> just like with ford pinto
[17:21:08] <SlimmyJimmy> Is that a car or an Intel code name. :)
[17:21:40] <maroon> car, gas tanks tended to explode with rear-end collision
[17:21:54] <SlimmyJimmy> Okay, I never heard about that.
[17:22:28] <maroon> they had internal documents revealed, showing they calculated it was cheaper to pay death claims than to recall/fix. the jury didnt seem to like that

[20:00:43] <SlimmyJimmy> :)
[20:00:44] <int-e> then people can decide whether they can confidently answer it (and find it interesting enough to do so)
[20:01:24] <SlimmyJimmy> How do I know which hashcat mode to use when there using words like BlowFish? There is no hashcat "Blowfish" mode.
[20:01:36] <SlimmyJimmy> That's what I don't get.
[20:01:49] <MacGyver> That's probably just bcrypt.
[20:02:07] <SlimmyJimmy> bcrypt is non-existent in the hashcat --help option also

[20:02:41] <SlimmyJimmy> Wow, let me look again.

[20:03:34] <SlimmyJimmy> Not in my help, I got 6.2.5 on Windows 11.
[20:03:54] <SlimmyJimmy> I didn't think there would be differences between Windows and Linux but maybe there are.
[20:05:26] <kashire> That seems like a weird thing to assume.
[20:06:02] <SlimmyJimmy> I did find it though, It's not associated with TrueCrypt
[20:06:03] <kashire> There are differences between many of these kinds of programs on Windows / Linux / OpenBSD. Even in order you have to write things.
[20:06:35] <SlimmyJimmy> Which is what made this whole discovery of knowledge even more confusing.
[20:06:53] <SlimmyJimmy> Wow
[20:07:29] <SlimmyJimmy> Then you gotta translate all these codenames to other names so blowfish is b-crypt.
[20:07:41] <SlimmyJimmy> It's like a big puzzle.
[20:08:12] <MacGyver> Well no, but bcrypt is the password hash function based on blowfish so if you've got references to blowfish in the context of passwords it's very likely it's actually bcrypt.
[20:09:16] <SlimmyJimmy> Yes, so the thing is I searched all hash modes of hashcat using the words "truecrypt" and "veracrypt", there were options specifically mentioning b-crypt or blowfish. So, it's a CF of options.
[20:09:38] <SlimmyJimmy> I don't think hashcat is convering "all" the bases and that's not to say it's the programs fault.
[20:09:54] <SlimmyJimmy> But it makes it harder for a n00b like me to know how to proceed.
[20:10:16] <SlimmyJimmy> corrections in my text above: there were "no" options 
[20:10:25] <int-e> TrueCrypt also supports Blowfish as a block cipher for the actual encryption, so there's a possible confusion here.
[20:11:16] <SlimmyJimmy> Yes, I'm aware, and it also supports mixed up to 3 of those encryptions, so how do I figure out the -m number in that scenario.
[20:11:33] <SlimmyJimmy> so 3 all at once
[20:11:51] <SlimmyJimmy> And that's what I did for the container I'm trying to crack a known password on.
[20:12:05] <int-e> (Which really has nothing to do with Hashcat, it's more about understanding what the Truecrypt configuration is. Once you know that, you can figure out whether hashcat can help you in finding the password...)
[20:12:37] <SlimmyJimmy> I do know, I just told you, i choose the mix of 3 encryptions, how do I translate that to a hashcat mode that it doesn't show a mixed option for?
[20:13:08] <SlimmyJimmy> Unless...I have to replace bcrypt with blowish, then I probably have to do that 2 more times for codes I haven't deciphered yet.
[20:13:15] <SlimmyJimmy> That's probably what you're saying.
[20:17:09] <TimMc> Don't Truecrypt volumes indicate which algorithms were used?
[20:17:22] <SlimmyJimmy> yes, they do once mounted.
[20:17:33] <TimMc> No, I mean the bytes on disk, in the header.
[20:17:50] <SlimmyJimmy> Oh, hell no. I don't think so. That would make cracking easier wouldnt it?
[20:17:59] <TimMc> not really
[20:18:05] <SlimmyJimmy> There is no header information in container files.
[20:18:35] <joe7057> no. The rule with encryption is that our ONLY secret is the key. The algorithm should be known so it can be a well-vetted standard.
[20:18:38] <TimMc> Let me ask a different question: When you go to *mount* a Truecrypt volume, are you asked to select the algorithm from a list?
[20:18:49] <SlimmyJimmy> No
[20:19:01] <TimMc> So does Truecrypt try each option in turn, then?
[20:19:07] <SlimmyJimmy> It "discovers" the encryption method by trial and error.
[20:19:15] <SlimmyJimmy> Yes
[20:19:15] <joe7057> No. I believe that the actual header info is stored encrypted, in a way that is always the same.
[20:19:21] <TimMc> Fair enough.
[20:19:40] <joe7057> oh really? Thats interesting. I assumed they would just encrypt the header in the first X bytes of the container
[20:19:58] <TimMc> So really, hashcat should provide a "generic Truecrypt" option that does the same "try each one".
[20:20:36] <TimMc> Does hashcat allow you to specify a list of modes?
[20:21:42] <SlimmyJimmy> I'd like it if hashcat were more "user friendly" and it did discovery stuff but apparently that's called hand holding for the user and is frowned upon.
[20:22:46] <int-e> AFAICS hashcat doesn't have TC+blowfish though, only TC+twofish (and aes, and serpent, and chained versions of those three)
[20:23:00] <SlimmyJimmy> To be fair, though, I think there is a utility on Linux that identifies the encryption method, or at least it attempts to.
[20:23:05] <SlimmyJimmy> I forget the name.
[20:23:12] <SlimmyJimmy> hashid I think
[20:25:26] <SlimmyJimmy> I haven't been able to try that yet. Maybe I can reboot up into a Kali Linux and see how it works.

[21:03:58] <SlimmyJimmy> What I don't know, I have no problem learning though, which is what I'm doing right now, day by day
[21:04:39] <wasamasa> you need to at least understand the crypto you're trying to crack and how the tool works
[21:05:15] <SlimmyJimmy> hashcat is a very complex tool, this is a skill that develops over time I"m sure.

[21:18:46] <kashire> lol

[21:19:15] <kashire> I'll just be that guy, then. Yes, you should really consider using Linux (or better yet, openbsd)
[21:19:15] <int-e> Okay, I think I get the idea... hashcat has a fixed list of ciphers it tests hardcoded in the various TrueCrypt modules. https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/OpenCL/m06213-pure.cl#L385-L407 tests for a single cipher, then below is a check for two chained ciphers and in the end there's a check for three chained ciphers. Seems rather ad-hoc, but I don't know to what extent TrueCrypt...
[21:19:17] <wasamasa> like perl scripts to convert whatever you want to crack into a hash
[21:19:21] <int-e> ...restricts this chaining.
[21:20:42] <int-e> So on the plus side you don't need to know the cipher being used to use it. On the minus side, blowfish isn't on the list.

[21:20:59] <SlimmyJimmy> That's what I'm trying to figure out, whether they have covered all the bases of chaining for a user friendly experience or you have to know how to specify the 3 different methods for chaining.
[21:21:10] <int-e> (And if you chain the ciphers in any way not tested there you're also out of luck.)
[21:21:18] <SlimmyJimmy> Exactly, if my specific 3 methods aren't a "pre-defined" mode then I'm lost.
[21:21:46] <int-e> And the 512/1024/1536 distinction is basically about how many keys you're deriving... the 512 bit variant only tests single ciphers.
[21:22:24] <SlimmyJimmy> Ah, so is a 1536-bit check a 3-cipher mix then?
[21:22:27] *** Quits: Sofia (~sofia@gateway/tor-sasl/sofia) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[21:23:07] <SlimmyJimmy> That would be a good thing to know, if that's the case.
[21:23:23] <int-e> As far as I can see, yes. (The source file I linked is the 1536 bit version)
[21:23:24] <SlimmyJimmy> I could limit my has checks to 1536-bit modes only.
[21:23:33] <SlimmyJimmy> hash
[21:23:47] <SlimmyJimmy> Because I know I used 3 on most of my containers, if not all.
[21:23:59] <int-e> Well, one of them, 6213 (note that this number occurs again in the file name) is "RIPEMD160 + XTS 1536 bit"
[21:27:33] <int-e> And that's the bit of magic I was looking for earlier when I wrote I was trying to understand hashcat... I had found that the modules for modes 6211 and 6212 only differ in their description and self-test hash, not in any code, so I was mystified how hashcat would perform differently for them. But hashcat picking up differen .cl files explains that :-)
[21:28:39] <SlimmyJimmy> Do you know what XTS means?
[21:29:11] <int-e> what was that, xor tweaked cipher with ciphertext stealing? It's a cipher mode.
[21:29:38] <SlimmyJimmy> So does the XTS equate to a mixed-cipher of 3 or could it be any number of ciphers?
[21:29:44] <int-e> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_encryption_theory#XEX-based_tweaked-codebook_mode_with_ciphertext_stealing_(XTS)
[21:29:49] <SlimmyJimmy> Thank You.
[21:29:55] <int-e> it's independent of the actual block cipher
[21:30:04] <int-e> (which can be a chain of several block ciphers)
[21:30:38] <int-e> it's how you lift that to whole sectors on the disk (usually called blocks these days, but that's confusing)
