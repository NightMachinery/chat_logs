[00:11:20] <deniska> tokerboker: I had a single client with whom I worked long term in 2014-2016
[00:11:21] <sonny> [itchyjunk]: the proper term is "boolean guards" I just checked haskell 2010
[00:11:26] <Stefan26> your bot's job is to spot the most human human!
[00:11:30] <tokerboker> deniska: that is nice!
[00:11:39] <epony> hahahahahaskell
[00:11:40] <Stefan26> (least likely to be a bot)
[00:11:44] <[itchyjunk]> sonny, what part of that would you consider to be bookeal guard
[00:11:53] <tokerboker> Stefan26: that is actually easy unless a bot is trying to act human.
[00:11:55] <epony> last person to say haskell today loses
[00:11:57] <[itchyjunk]> it seems that some think the `even x` part is the guard
[00:12:02] <[itchyjunk]> other everything after |
[00:12:10] <deniska> tokerboker: then the gig died off, I got "a proper job" early 2017, began finding some more gigs in 2019
[00:12:29] <GeDaMo> [itchyjunk]: I think guard just means conditional
[00:12:36] <Stefan26> how is it easy? to know whether it's good or not you'd have to travel 50 years into the future when bots can actually talk like humans
[00:12:39] <tokerboker> deniska: that sounds patchy if i wanted to just rely on freelancing.
[00:12:39] <[itchyjunk]> so `even x` is guard?
[00:12:40] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: guard just means "if" really, by a different name

[00:13:11] <tokerboker> deniska: did you ever think that upgrading your skills as a better alternative than finding jobs?
[00:13:20] <tokerboker> given freelancing gives you arguably more freedom
[00:13:29] <sonny> [itchyjunk]: for a comprehension [ e | q1, ... , qn] a boolean guard is any q that is an arbitrary expression of type Bool
[00:13:31] <deniska> tokerboker: but still have 2 projects to work on, today declined the third because frankly I have no much free time
[00:13:38] <GeDaMo> [itchyjunk]: you can have multiple guards in a list comprehension, e.g. [x | x <- [1..10], even x, x > 5]
[00:13:42] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: the name comes from Dijkstra's old guarded command language which had a command called "if" which 'guarded' execution down the paths
[00:13:46] <tokerboker> i see.

[00:14:10] <deniska> tokerboker: And I'm 50% WFH so I'm relatively free in that sense
[00:14:19] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: today the word "guard" gets used in lots of places, "condition" is another word like that. guard/condition/etc they all basically mean the same thing and languages pick and choose from the pot of words to call bits of the syntax those things

[00:15:18] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: so if I go `f x | x > 2 = 42` then the `x > 2` part is the guard

[02:27:08] <duuude> Let's make BSD/Hurd

[02:27:48] <epony> second, userland applications can not be used without operating systems
[02:27:55] <flakland> not true, linu x requires init process
[02:27:59] <nomagno> duuude: Essentially impossible thanks to GNU's policy of being self-hosting since the Paleolithic and having GNU specific features in every line of code
[02:28:09] <epony> Linux is not an OS

[02:29:05] <duuude> even my little experience with gnu C, gmake, glibc tells me that gnu is a fractal of bad design
[02:29:12] <pyzozord> I need to remember to not indulge trolls
[02:29:22] <epony> flakland, you don't have a side other than reacting emotionally, so your side is emo
[02:29:23] <duuude> let's not even consider gnome gnu
[02:29:41] <nomagno> GNOME is not a part of GNU
[02:30:17] <nomagno> GNU finally removed them from the list of projects. They have been independent communities since like 20 years ago
[02:30:21] <epony> the point is, calling GNU an OS is an incorrect overstatement, it's ambitious and wants to be, and did a lot of work to become, but is not the OS
[02:30:23] <flakland> you claim linux is not an os,  so then debian is not an OS because it requires linux kernel in some configurations and that depends on init process, since OS's don't depend on userland your fantasy world has fallen apart
[02:30:43] <duuude> Linux is an OS
[02:31:02] <duuude> See the logic is simple:
[02:31:06] <pyzozord> this is the typeof factless, semantical nonsense discussion that we need to work to have less of. Doesn't benefit anyone. It's not informative, it's not fun. It's just a waste
[02:31:08] <epony> people here claim that Linux requires and needs GNU
[02:31:21] <nomagno> duuude: Linux by itself is very unworkable, you'll have a hard time compiling it to an embedded platform without userland
[02:31:22] <duuude> You tell the same thing Linux, and everyone knows what you talk of
[02:31:24] <nomagno> But technically, sure
[02:31:35] <epony> Operating Systems do not require and need applications, they provide facilities for these
[02:31:46] <[itchyjunk]> when you say "linux", is tehre a specific code base bsing refered to?
[02:31:55] <duuude> You call it GNU/Linux, you waste a decent amount of keypresses and you look like a lunatic
[02:32:03] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: no there isn't that's why the conversation they're all having is stupid
[02:32:04] <bjs> :P
[02:32:08] <nomagno> epony: They require them to exist, not to be a specific binary that matches a specific hash
[02:32:17] <[itchyjunk]> bjs, what is the "linux kernel" being talked about?
[02:32:18] <epony> it's actually Linux+GNU as a substitute for the UNIX OS
[02:32:25] <[itchyjunk]> it's the same thing in every linux based OS?
[02:32:32] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: "the linux kernel" *is* a specific piece of code, but that isn't "Linux"
[02:32:37] <[itchyjunk]> or does ubuntu write its own linux kernel and debian its own?
[02:32:54] <[itchyjunk]> oh okay. who managed the linux kernel?
[02:32:56] <jeaye> Linux is the engine. GNU is the rest of the car. The car part can be swapped out, as it has been with Android. The engine part can be swapped out, too, as it has been with Hurd.

[02:34:41] <[itchyjunk]> BSD, gentoo, archlinux and debian all have different kernels?
[02:34:45] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: If you download something like Debian you get the Linux kernel, probably some kind of bootloader, a bunch of libraries and software tacked on and some "user"land stuff that isn't part of the OS at all

[02:35:03] <jeaye> [itchyjunk]: Gentoo, Arch, and Debian all use the Linux kernel.
[02:35:06] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: BSD is its own kernel (not linux), gentoo and archlinux use linux
[02:35:06] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: *bsd systems have separate kernels, gentoo, archlinux, debian use linux
[02:35:13] <[itchyjunk]> oh
[02:35:14] <flakland> just say GNO to whatever blogs poisoned epony's mind
[02:35:31] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: and then there's (or was?) debian/kFreeBSD which uses debian userland with freebsd kernel

[02:36:21] <[itchyjunk]> i've heard of that, the Unix OS

[02:36:31] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: nowadays "unix-like" is more of a "you know it when you see it" kind of deal
[02:36:31] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: if you were to go back and use Unix today, it would be "familiar" in a distant kind of way

[02:37:56] <[itchyjunk]> android also has "linux kernel" in it ?
[02:37:59] <jeaye> GNU can be used as an OS because it contains its own kernel.

[02:38:01] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: yes.

[02:39:04] <jeaye> [itchyjunk]: It's unixy, not Linuxy. macOS uses BSD tools, not GNU tools.
[02:39:04] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk]: it feels linux *nix, because it's bsd which is a unix
[02:39:10] <[itchyjunk]> seems like a lot of OS's i know of are just linux kernel in the core
[02:39:13] <jeaye> [itchyjunk]: So things like sed have slightly different flags.
[02:39:23] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk]: linux is not a unix but it (like unix) complies to posix
[02:39:23] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: what makes a terminal feel unixy/linuxy isn't really tied to a kernel
[02:39:43] <[itchyjunk]> deniska, fairenough
[02:39:44] <PlanckWalk> My router runs Linux.  It does not use GNU.
[02:39:48] <epony> POSIX does not say how your kernel is organised.
[02:39:59] <[itchyjunk]> there was a shell i used in windows that was very linuxy.. can't rememebr the name
[02:40:08] <[itchyjunk]> "compiles to posix", idk what that means
[02:40:09] <nomagno> [itchyjunk]: The Unix philosophy has a few axioms thay may be swapped out as time goes on, but: 
[02:40:09] <nomagno> Principle 1: "Make each program do one thing, and do it well. Encourage combining programs. Assume the output of each program is the input of a future unknown program"
[02:40:09] <nomagno> Principle 2: "All data is a single stream of text"
[02:40:09] <nomagno> Principle 3: "Everything is a file. Things like drivers, network stack, keyboard input, shall be mapped to the filesystem"
[02:40:16] <epony> so it's a standard about the OS interface and some interfaces of it to be present and in a specific details
[02:40:19] <duuude> pyzozord: it is a unix too. there is a certified distro.
[02:40:20] <nomagno> These are just some of the main ones
[02:40:27] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: it's a set of commonly named executables (mv, cp, rm etc), some common file paths (/bin, /etc etc), some common concepts (mount points, files, processes)
[02:40:28] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: basically the Linux kernel is the bit of software deep inside your computer that runs after the machine boots and has the scheduler, manages the memory and file system and generally talks to devices. 
[02:40:29] <epony> however no such thing as "what your kernel interals will be"
[02:40:30] <[itchyjunk]> What about Red Hat? own kernel or still linux in there somewhere?
[02:40:40] <PlanckWalk> Red Hat is a Linux
[02:40:42] <jeaye> [itchyjunk]: Red Hat is a GNU/Linux distro.
[02:40:54] <PlanckWalk> (and yes, also uses GNU)
[02:40:58] <[itchyjunk]> damn.. everyone is just offering linux with different clothes
[02:40:59] <duuude> [itchyjunk]: all of the linux distros have linux
[02:41:07] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: everything else is what you get when you download something like Ubuntu/Debian/ArchLinux etc
[02:41:09] <deniska> RHEL, "redhat" wasn't a distro for quite a while

[02:42:36] <[itchyjunk]> so if i had a blank hardware like riscv, i could start with linux kernel to manage all the hardware bit , memory etc etc then it would just need applications that user wants
[02:42:38] <nomagno> Not really mandatory, mind you
[02:42:40] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: common non-linux unix(-like) systems you can encounter nowadays are various bsd (mostly freebsd, netbsd, openbsd), some solaris offshoots (opensolaris, openindiana), macos

[02:43:02] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: yes (assuming someone had done to work to make Linux talk RISC-V, which people have done)
[02:43:27] <jeaye> [itchyjunk]: Many of them are closely related, too. Ubuntu is a descendent of Debian. Pop!_OS is a descendent of Ubuntu. Manjaro is a descendent of Arch. and so on and so on
[02:43:28] <nomagno> duude: Windows what? windows is pretty much the only non-Unixy OS in current use, yes
[02:43:28] <[itchyjunk]> does each version of windows have a new kernel or is there `the windows kernel` in each of them?
[02:43:32] <nomagno> You also have VMS
[02:43:41] <nomagno> Which is actually older than Unix, and still sokd

[02:43:48] <duuude> [itchyjunk]: it has NT
[02:43:51] <nomagno> But it is only used by banks and mikitaries
[02:43:56] <[itchyjunk]> yeah, i've used debian, ubuntu, manjara, kali and puppylinux i think
[02:43:56] <nomagno> And casinos, and such
[02:44:01] <epony> if people doing GUIs have read that, you would have your desktoy by now ;-)
[02:44:03] <duuude> [itchyjunk]: NT gets reused
[02:44:04] <[itchyjunk]> oh "NT" is the kernel? interesting
[02:44:05] <pulse> windows has been based on the NT kernel since forever afaik
[02:44:10] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: windows uses NT kernel since early windows nt, then 2000, xp, vista, 7 etc
[02:44:16] <nomagno> pulse: Yeah
[02:44:24] <[itchyjunk]> ive heard of "NT", didn't realize it was the kernel
[02:44:31] <pulse> it was the first kernel that didn't actively crash for no reason
[02:44:32] <pulse> :D
[02:44:42] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: it doesn't really have a marketed name because it's not a product sold separately, but "nt kernel" is a common nickname

[02:45:21] <[itchyjunk]> My guess would be xbox operating system uses NT as kernel
[02:45:25] <nomagno> (Microsoft calls it NT)
[02:45:29] <[itchyjunk]> i wonder what the kernel for windows phone is
[02:45:30] <epony> nomagno, so no need to come up with your own "partial list of principles", just find your most appropriate one from the list of such classic definitions, like you do not invent your own license.. since you're an individual (and these would apply only to you)
[02:45:41] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: windows phone since wp8 iirc also uses NT kernel
[02:45:54] <duuude> [itchyjunk]: xbox is NT, windows phone was CE or something
[02:45:59] <PlanckWalk> The really old ones used WinCE
[02:46:00] <[itchyjunk]> interesting, so once you have a kernel, you get to reuse it for all sorts of hardware huh?
[02:46:10] <PlanckWalk> Which was a great name.  "wince"
[02:46:11] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: microsoft also had windows CE lineup, and whatever the heck you could call win9x kernel
[02:46:13] <nomagno> epony: I'm not sure what you mean, I listed pretty safe characteristics
[02:46:19] <[itchyjunk]> WinCE is a different kernel designed just for phones?
[02:46:20] <epony> insufficient
[02:46:34] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: windows ce was designed for handheld PCs :D
[02:46:35] <nomagno> epony: an OS may be Unix-like and ignore one or many of these
[02:46:36] <epony> nomagno, check the particular one I listed
[02:46:47] <[itchyjunk]> like "surface pro" ?
[02:46:51] <epony> nomagno, there are 2 books by that author, and they are very important

[02:47:09] <[itchyjunk]> wait, did Blackberry have kernel?
[02:47:12] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: well someone has to write a "driver" so the kernel knows how to interact with that hardware.  But yes the kernel itself can be the same. The same filesystem, scheduler, memory management stuff, can all be just used.

[02:47:53] <[itchyjunk]> bjs, i never thought of hardware wrt kernels before
[02:47:59] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: what would be the difference between "firmware" and "kernel"?
[02:48:05] <duuude> [itchyjunk]: if it is an OS it has a kernel
[02:48:29] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: typically when we say "kernel" today we mean it as part of the operating system.  If you're talking about something that doesn't have what you'd call an "operating system" then it's up to you what to call the thing that runs on it
[02:48:30] <[itchyjunk]> what if its not an OS? phones only go smart after 2005 or so i think
[02:48:40] <nomagno> [itchyjunk]: Well mobile phones have an OS, almost by definition. Early early ones were just firmware, but after the 90s it was embedded operating systems such as Symbian
[02:48:43] <sonny> phones were smart since 2000s
[02:48:46] <[itchyjunk]> oh i see

[02:50:29] <node1> Hi
[02:50:31] <[itchyjunk]> How "software" and "hardware" talk to each other is still a bit convoluted to me. even after discussing about this in the fpga channel
[02:50:37] <duuude> hi node1
[02:50:38] <epony> nomagno, you listed part of the principles.. which are not public reference material but "own wording"
[02:50:50] <node1> Any nodejs programmer here?
[02:51:01] <Decker> sure
[02:51:03] *** Quits: peace-angel (uid530400@user/star1) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[02:51:06] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: well, software is a program running on the CPU.  The program says "write this value to that memory location" and then that is how you talk to hardware. By writing to different memory locations.
[02:51:07] <epony> nomagno, so you get comments back ;-) that's what online chat does to people
[02:51:09] <duuude> node1: #javascript probably
[02:51:16] <Decker> #node.js even
[02:51:28] <[itchyjunk]> bjs, is CPU a hardware or a software here?
[02:51:36] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: software is a set of instructions, some of these instructions can have great effect on the hardware which runs it
[02:51:42] <epony> that's the same with mailing lists, you don't need to ask to be told something as a comment to your emails
[02:51:45] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: I mean, the CPU is a bit of sand inside the big box you have
[02:51:49] <bjs> I think it's safe to say it's hardware
[02:51:51] <[itchyjunk]> i know when electricity first starts surging, some blob loads up somewhere somehow that does some stuff
[02:51:54] <[itchyjunk]> before anything else
[02:51:56] <bjs> if you can touch it and get a burn, it's hardware :P
[02:52:04] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: (typically encoded as memory reads and writes to special locations, but may as well be special hardware-talking instructions)
[02:52:04] <pyzozord> epony that's what some people choose to do to people
[02:52:17] <nomagno> [itchyjunk]: the CPU is a mechanical (electromagnetic these days) interpreter for software

[02:52:34] <duuude> are foldable phones hardware?
[02:52:36] <pyzozord> epony which is utterly unhelpful and unconstructive

[02:53:15] <[itchyjunk]> turtles all the way down
[02:53:16] <nomagno> [itchyjunk]: You know logic gates? AND, OR, XOR, NOT, etc.?
[02:53:21] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: well you can think of the boot process as roughly "Power turns on, the chip runs a hard-coded program to load the kernel into memory, then the CPU turns on and begins running the code in memory"
[02:53:22] <[itchyjunk]> yes

[02:54:04] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: oh oh, I have a youtube playlist which may interest you :D
[02:54:13] <deniska> pulse: you mispelled "PalmOS"
[02:54:22] <[itchyjunk]> but apparently, a cpu doesn't even know about all the peripheries around it, like you have have a different cpu talking to parts of first cpu and the first one doesn't even know about it etc
[02:54:22] <Decker> webos
[02:54:26] <nomagno> [itchyjunk]: a CPU is pretty much just a mechanical machine that performs these logic gate operations over and over based on its input

[02:54:42] <pyzozord> epony so listen, whatever part of the internet you come from, in this channel we try to be nice to each other, those are the rules. I refer you again to the /topic
[02:54:43] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: usually the only way a CPU has to talk to the outside world is by writing to memory.

[02:54:52] <duuude> Symbian :'(
[02:54:55] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: It's just that some memory locations are secretly wired up to devices.

[02:59:56] <deniska> sonny: a typical computer (that includes a phone) probably has more than a single CPU, each may run its own OS

[03:00:17] <sonny> I thought those were only in the demos ...
[03:00:20] <epony> it's common arm chips have linux-es in them
[03:00:22] <deniska> sonny: heck, intel CPUs have intel management engine, which is its own CPU inside a CPU which runs minix of all things
[03:00:22] <sonny> wow
[03:00:28] <PlanckWalk> Even keyboards usually have their own CPU.
[03:00:34] <epony> controller
[03:00:37] <sonny> PlanckWalk: seriously?
[03:00:40] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: so this is nice, your software can talk to things by writing registers or writing to memory but you can also talk to things outside the CPU through "special" registers and/or memory locations.
[03:00:41] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[03:00:43] <Decker> I think the final environment a system provides is more important than the nitty gritty details
[03:00:46] <pyzozord> epony gnu is not os, linux is not an os, and you sir have an uncommon definition of what os is to say the least
[03:01:04] <pyzozord> And i am going to sleep, goodnight
[03:01:12] <deniska> sonny: CPUs (at least simple ones) became cheap enough that it's just cheaper to put a CPU with some program rather than to make a specialized chip
[03:01:32] <sonny> nordic nrf1 supports an rtos and it's super small, never did I think it would get used alongside an OS in a larger system
[03:01:35] <sonny> funky
[03:01:39] <[itchyjunk]> bjs, that makes sense
[03:01:48] <epony> pyzozord, maybe.. many mailing lists have the same views and disagreements, it's normal
[03:01:49] <[itchyjunk]> reminds me of arduino
[03:02:08] <sonny> deniska: ah
[03:02:13] <flakland> how many?
[03:02:15] <duuude> deniska: Did symbian and QNX need that separate CPU/OS? They were RTOS themselves
[03:02:28] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: yeah, I do recommend grabbing something like a raspberry pi and writing your own little "kernel" for it.  Write some asm/C that writes to the magic locations to make things work and see it do the things.
[03:02:29] <Decker> how about...  there's never 'real time' only 'in time'   and often what the difference is between general in-time and realtime is not nesscarily mission critical
[03:02:37] <deniska> duuude: well, there's typically a single "big" CPU which runs most of the show
[03:02:53] <sonny> real-time is fake!!??
[03:02:56] <deniska> duuude: qnx or symbian aren't different from any other OS, they run on this "big" CPU
[03:02:56] <Decker> bjs that was my plan.   but then it's got all these other devices you have to deal with too
[03:02:58] <PlanckWalk> Yes, I don't like the "Real Time" terminology :(
[03:03:03] <Decker> like it's not just a cpu
[03:03:04] <sonny> what about cars and robot arms?!!
[03:03:21] <bjs> Decker: well you only need the serial port to make things workable
[03:03:32] <PlanckWalk> There's just increasing levels of consequences for not getting stuff done in time, and therefore more and more effort to make sure stuff is done in time.
[03:03:42] <sonny> wow
[03:03:51] <bjs> and that's certainly more than enough to get to play with all the fancy registers/memory-mapped things to talk to hardware and get a feel for what's going on
[03:04:05] <epony> pyzozord, no hard feelings.. peace and talk again on non-diverging points ;-)
[03:04:15] <bjs> sonny: "real-time" often just means "assign hard deadlines"
[03:04:37] <sonny> PlanckWalk: also in osdev, it's due to choice of interrupt design vs polling that gets in the way of getting data from the driver fast enough right?

[03:05:09] <PlanckWalk> Polling is sometimes a very reliable way of getting stuff done in time
[03:05:15] <sonny> so, is there anything special about QNX vs Linux?

[03:05:32] <epony> yes, QNX is proprietary
[03:05:34] <Decker> truly timing sensitive things ... like detecting if a coin is going into or out of a slot with a couple light couples- is often better buffering the result and communicating it to a more general system; while internally just being a few flipflops
[03:05:35] <flakland> linux needs patches for realtime
[03:05:39] <epony> (closed and RT intended)
[03:05:51] <deniska> sonny: Linux doesn't provide a good way for a program to assign a hard deadline before something has to happen

[03:06:05] <Decker> they're both microkernel architectures
[03:06:23] <sonny> that's interesting

[03:06:34] <deniska> sonny: in qnx a process may say "ok, don't interrupt me now, don't run anything else, it's really important", on linux not so much
[03:06:38] <bjs> sonny: just giving something a deadline doesn't magically make your thing real-time because you actually then have to schedule things so that they meet their deadlines.  Often real-time scheduling algorithms are actually slower

[03:09:23] <Decker> that's more like a point of pre-emption... 'I'm running now' and ignore that there was anything else
[03:09:31] <PlanckWalk> Not for any one car every day naturally, but a large proportion of faults that require service are software problems.
[03:09:31] <bjs> sonny: if you look at aviation you won't find Linux controlling the planes key systems (for example).
[03:09:55] <sonny> bjs: is there even an OS there in control situations?
[03:09:58] <bjs> sonny: but on my phone? so what if it goes wrong, does something bad, slows down a bit sometimes etc
[03:09:59] <deniska> Decker: yeah, in a real time kernel, a process may want to ask kernel to ignore interrupts coming from hardware
[03:10:04] <PlanckWalk> One the whole it can still be a net win if the software prevents more hardware faults.
[03:10:19] <epony> sonny, however software has a chance of being "extended" qualities of the hardware, and usually works quite reliably, given there are no unintended exposed hardware faults on complex conditions

[06:09:50] <FloridaMan> let's say I have a resource called a "category" and I wanted to test just *all* of my category functionality, including routes... Putting all the category stuff together in the same directory makes it very easy to achieve this
[06:10:51] <rickame> k so ya
[06:11:13] <rickame> anyone do it the other way? like having a routes_exist() test that makes sure every route doesn't 404
[06:11:25] <FloridaMan> you could use a standard filename pattern for route-specific stuff though and use a filename pattern to filter only to route tests and achieve the same result as running a massive all-routes test

[07:29:43] <PlanckWalk> LOC or any other objective measure of the code itself?  Never.
[07:29:50] <pulse> hours worked isn't always objective either
[07:30:04] <pulse> "tickets done" is probably the most objective way to measure progress

[07:40:09] <PlanckWalk> Of what, for what purpose?
[07:40:31] <sonny> complexity, and to demonstrate progress

[07:42:36] <PlanckWalk> When you start, you have 0 complexity and 0 progress sure.  Maybe in the middle you have lots of complexity and substantial progress.  Then you find a way to reduce complexity and get the same things done.  Have you reversed progress?
[07:42:45] <sonny> reduction could be a goal, increase could mean maybe it's time to do another task
[07:43:07] <PlanckWalk> Well, complexity is always going to increase if you start from 0.
[07:43:16] <sonny> yeah
[07:43:19] <PlanckWalk> Not monotonically, but it's not going to go back to 0 either.

[07:46:41] <sonny> ok, that's interesting
[07:46:52] <sonny> good
[07:46:53] <PlanckWalk> Using complexity to measure progress seems like measuring toilet flushes to measure restaurant quality.
[07:47:30] <sonny> those dev hell projects seem to have infinite complexity, so I don't think so
[07:47:45] <PlanckWalk> Sure, a good restaurant might be busy and have more customers using the toilets, but a bad one might give everyone diarrhea.

[07:48:41] <pulse> sonny, needless complexity is ... needless
[07:48:47] <pulse> the job of an engineer is to reduce complexity
[07:49:06] <sonny> well, it's to complete the task
[07:49:26] <pulse> you know how in math you simplify things to their most basic form
[07:49:30] <sonny> PlanckWalk had a great idea, explicit labeling of tasks and subtasks
[07:49:33] <pulse> you should do the same in engineering
[07:49:42] <pulse> because otherwise the complexity grows faster than you can keep up with it
[07:49:47] <PlanckWalk> So maybe measuring how much of the task is complete might be worthwhile?  Including designs that have zero lines of code but will inform future code.

[08:39:10] <pulse> but tunnel depth dug per day is a pretty decent measurement
[08:39:15] <FloridaMan> To get the accuracy closer then the commitment is changed, which gives the organization a more accurate estimate of when something will be complete. If they're unsatisfied with the dates then they can make other changes

[12:01:54] <dan01> But what is a thread?
[12:02:09] <PlanckWalk> Threads and processes basically are the same thing
[12:02:22] <PlanckWalk> The distinction is really just how much memory they share
[12:02:40] <Donkey_A> but also the creation time

[14:45:01] <auctus> im following along with this thing https://github.com/stackgl/shader-school
[14:45:03] <bayaz> Title: GitHub - stackgl/shader-school: A workshopper for GLSL shaders and graphics programming 
[14:45:28] <auctus> so i tried this which would probably work in some other language:
[14:45:34] <auctus> adjacent = sqrt(pow(hypotenuse,2) - pow(opposite,2));
[14:46:04] <auctus> but i guess uh, glsl doesn't cast int to float automagically, no problem. I changed it to float by appending .0
[14:46:16] <auctus> > answer still not valid
[14:46:22] *** Quits: job (~job@wikimedia-commons/pandakekok9) (Remote host closed the connection)
[14:46:43] <auctus> so i copied someone else's solution to see if it works at all:
[14:46:45] <auctus> adjacent = cos(theta) * hypotenuse;
[14:46:56] <auctus> works fine... must be different levels of precision in those two operations
[14:47:29] *** Joins: Twipply (~Twipply@user/twipply)
[14:47:47] <auctus> tried it in python, which gives me 15.703504999077099 and 15.7035049990771 respectively, so probably similar in glsl?

[14:49:15] <zim> tomathy, also most dev literature I've read doesn't mention UML in that way. I feel it's mostly used in some books and docs to show/document some aspect of a system. So I think it's useful to be able to understand the most common UML diagrams.

[15:17:56] <tomathy> when you define a string in C as a char pointer, how does the program know how to reserve enough space?
[15:18:31] <GeDaMo> char *s doesn't allocate any space for the string, only the pointer itself
[15:18:47] <tomathy> so how come it stores all that data to memory
[15:19:17] <pyzozord> wow it's only 13
[15:19:17] <GeDaMo> Which data?
[15:19:27] <pyzozord> I feel like I already did a full day today
[15:19:46] <tomathy> GeDaMo: char * "unlimited amount of data";
[15:20:18] <tomathy> sorry char * p = "unlimited..";
[15:20:52] <GeDaMo> The string literal is in the executable, space is allocated at load time and the pointer is set to point to it
[15:21:10] <GeDaMo> Note that string literals are often in read-only memory
[15:22:07] *** Joins: Mangy_Dog (Mange@user/mangy-dog/x-7397214)
[15:22:13] <tomathy> so what's actually happening in that statement is 1) write a string to memory 2) save its starting point in the variable p
[15:22:20] <GeDaMo> Yes
[15:23:05] <tomathy> why is "write a string to memory" completely absent from the expression?
[15:23:48] <tomathy> and where is this memory, RAM?
[15:23:49] <merijn> "because that's how C is defined"
[15:23:52] <GeDaMo> It's loaded at the same time as the executable
[15:24:11] <merijn> tomathy: Ah, you're making a classic mistake. You are mixing up 2 separate layers of abstraction
[15:25:07] *** Quits: frost (~frost@user/frost) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[15:25:12] <merijn> tomathy: In *C* there's no such thing as RAM. The C standard defines "how could should be have", but it does so without any actual references to, like, real hardware. How a compiler (or other C implementation) chooses to actually *implement* the specified behaviour is up to the compiler
[15:25:31] <merijn> tomathy: So "write the string to memory" isn't anywhere, because C doesn't actually require that at all
[15:25:52] <tomathy> ok i see
[15:25:54] *** Joins: Raphalex (~Raphalex@user/raphalex)
[15:26:25] <merijn> And usually the string isn't written to memory, string literals are usually dumped in the constants section of a program, meaning they *always* exist (you can even extract them with the strings program)
[15:26:53] <tomathy> you are saying the string is held in the memory of the program/binary?
[15:27:15] <merijn> Usually string literals are inside the binary, yes
[15:27:19] <tomathy> ok
[15:27:32] <merijn> but again, C doesn't actually require that, so "It Depends (TM)"
[15:28:18] <zim> tomathy, What's the reason you're interested in C?

[15:30:06] <merijn> Probably true, for a large number of jobs. Unfortunately, properly learning C is hard :\
[15:30:30] <auctus> learning it to a useful level takes years
[15:30:43] <merijn> Mostly because most books I've seen are atrocious and web resources are worse

[19:39:08] <nomagno> <<magine the time when men lived in caves. One bright guy—let's call him Galt-Magnon—decides to build a log cabin on an open field, near his crops. To be sure, this is a good idea, and others notice it. They naturally imitate Galt-Magnon, and they start building their own cabins. But the first man to invent a house, according to IP advocates, would have a right to prevent others from building houses on their own land, with their own
[19:39:08] <nomagno> logs, or to charge them a fee if they do build houses. It is plain that the innovator in these examples becomes a partial owner of the tangible property (e.g., land and logs) of others, due not to first occupation and use of that property (for it is already owned), but due to his coming up with an idea. Clearly, this rule flies in the face of the first-user homesteading rule, arbitrarily and groundlessly overriding the very homesteading rule
[19:39:08] <nomagno> that is at the foundation of all property rights.>>

[20:41:06] <mrig> oh thats the fossil, a little less so in the reconstruction, but the plates look very similar
[20:41:14] <apotheon> Shell scripts should generally be written in the syntax of the root shell.
[20:41:16] <megamus_prime> and they all follow standards so you can build one script for all of them

[20:46:49] <apotheon> The argument of some (especially of Bash fans) is that sometimes you want more features in your shell for scripting.  If you need more programming features, use a language designed for programming, not a shell -- which is, by definition, designed for interactive use.

[21:47:01] <megamus_prime> thermodynamics is the reason we can't have anything cool
[21:47:10] * jelly slaps megamus_prime 
[21:47:40] <megamus_prime> wasn't a pun I swear
[21:47:44] <deniska> if something is running on 3ghz, it means that parts 10cm are one wavelenth apart
[21:47:46] <jelly> yes dad
[21:48:13] <vdamewood> megamus_prime: It should have been.
[21:48:37] <megamus_prime> vdamewood, don't have that kinda wit

[21:49:15] <megamus_prime> deniska, would that kinda latency really be such an issue?
[21:49:27] <megamus_prime> vdamewood, like the simpleton I am
[21:49:50] <megamus_prime> deniska, really curious. I understand 0 about hardware
[21:50:30] <vdamewood> megamus_prime: It adds up.
[21:50:35] <deniska> megamus_prime: something like DRAM is designed with speed of light in mind, yes
[21:50:39] <GeDaMo> vdamewood: I had a thought about your computer: I wonder if you could use Flash for all of the memory, in place of RAM and ROM
[21:51:00] <deniska> megamus_prime: also with the fact in mind that small changes in temperature makes signal that slightly faster or slower

[21:53:23] <vdamewood> err No, I mean the one I have on my lap, right now.
[21:53:45] <vdamewood> Apparently Jobs did LSD and that was a major influence on his early career.
[21:53:59] <AbleBacon> hey, does anyone know the name / link to the discord that like... talks about video encoding, libraries, etc? i can't find it in my server list and it had kind of an unusual name that i don't recall
[21:54:13] <vdamewood> The computer I want to make is just going to be Ben Eater's but different.
[21:54:35] <GeDaMo> Jobs didn't design the computers, Woz did

[23:21:14] <nomagno> InPhase: stack VLA
[23:21:17] <InPhase> nomagno: Although that requires people to meticulously manually check for it.
[23:21:58] <nomagno> More correctly, automatic storage variable length arrays
[23:22:05] <nomagno> When you go overboard... crash!
[23:22:14] <apotheon> nomagno: C++ doesn't have "compact", "consistent", "simple", and "elegant" features.
[23:22:16] <InPhase> nomagno: Sure.  Which is why a stack VLA is not a good way to get robustness.
[23:22:44] <GeDaMo> There are C standards which forbid dynamic memory allocation of any kind
[23:22:54] <apotheon> It has almost every other feature, though.
[23:23:01] <nomagno> Agreed there
