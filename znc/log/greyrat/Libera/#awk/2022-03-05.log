[08:46:46] <Patsie> xmb: while ("awk" != "difficult") {
[08:46:49] <Patsie> this is not clear? :)
[08:48:18] <Patsie> I an not saying my code is always written with the best of comments and/or variable names, but I do try to give some indication of both in my code
[08:48:24] <xmb> ill check again , whats the url
[08:48:32] <Patsie> but I'm happy to explain anything which might be unclear
[08:48:43] <Patsie> github.com/patsie75
[08:48:45] <xmb> i cant much now i can only stack it up on my todo for later
[08:48:49] <xmb> thanks
[08:49:17] <Patsie> just 'star' it and you can never forget it again :D
[08:50:59] <xmb> will do, .. i just checked the 3d one, leaves more question marks than docs
[08:51:01] <xmb> :)
[08:52:36] <Patsie> just don't ask me about the math in it. that I can't explain and I just 'stole' ;)
[08:53:00] <Patsie> I can make it work, but 4d math is not my strong suit
[08:53:04] <Patsie> 3d*
[08:54:05] <xmb> i see
[08:54:21] <xmb> well ill see, but i expect more of interactive chats than my flat checking w/o knowing
[08:54:36] <xmb> it looked insane nice rendering 3d balls and lightening, .. full good
[08:55:27] <Patsie> are you talking about metaballs now?
[08:55:45] <Patsie> because that's completely different from awk-3d
[08:56:00] <Patsie> where 3d modeled objects can me shown
[08:56:11] <Patsie> awk-metballs is just a demo effect
[08:56:14] <xmb> yea i thought this
[08:56:22] <xmb> i mean i dont understand mate
[08:56:30] <xmb> i need a full doc demo :p
[08:56:36] <xmb> but nevermind yo
[08:56:58] <Patsie> well, I'm still working on awk-demo
[08:57:02] <Patsie> if that's what you're interested in
[08:57:07] <xmb> i see
[08:57:12] <xmb> ill kopi ur stuff then see
[08:57:29] <Patsie> actually trying to adapt awk-3d to run in any awk (not just gawk) so it can be part f awk-demo
[08:57:48] <xmb> very nice mate
[08:58:11] <Patsie> bit of a challenge, but I'll get there in a stripped down version
[08:58:13] <xmb> i bet i can maybe make houses with 3d points
[08:58:17] <Patsie> good enough to show some object(s)
[08:58:50] <xmb> very ownage stuff
[08:59:03] <Patsie> thanks
[08:59:24] <xmb> i experienced lately heavy fails with gawk, which made me wanna leave awk and co and their buggness
[09:02:01] <Patsie> it just means you're trying to work above your experience level with awk. can be good sometimes to extend your knowledge, but can be demotivating when it happens too often
[09:03:00] <Patsie> and unless you actually run into a real bug, it's easy to call its lack of a certain feature 'buggness'
[09:03:19] <Patsie> it's just a challenge to work around. expand your own knowledge
[09:03:37] <Patsie> and find ways to get things done without that handy feature that you know of that exists in languageX, Y or Z
[09:03:44] <xmb> there was a proven bug
[09:03:55] <xmb> that made RS not recognized on first hit but just later somewhen
[09:04:00] *** Joins: loganlee[gnu] (~Thunderbi@user/loganlee)
[09:04:06] <Patsie> it's written by humans so yeah, I'm not surprised it has bugs
[09:04:13] <xmb> and they said the only way to do fix that is rewrite whole gawk for instant right matchesm which wont happen
[09:04:44] <xmb> its gawk not awk for me cause RT value and such related, and no gawk cause it bugs :/
[09:04:55] <xmb> i tried via tcpserver a couple of times, big fails
[09:05:02] <xmb> but i didnt stdbuf -i 1 -o 1 right anyway too

[09:06:40] <xmb> not sure which exactly of these replies said that but they did
[09:07:14] <xmb> it bugged it didnt return after first match, but way later, .. in their tests it didnt even return *anything*
