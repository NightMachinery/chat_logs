[00:51:06] <bn_work> hi, gsed 4.2.2, why do I see dupes & extra spaces when I try to replace a single line with multiple lines?  ex:  `sed -i.build 's#resultCap = 1000#resultCap = 1000\n  configPath = "conf/foo.yaml"\n  stringConfigPath = "conf /foo2.yaml"\n#p;' /tmp/application.conf` results in the last few lines showing this instead:   https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/MSuwTeWE/%2Ftmp%2Fapplication.conf
[00:52:24] <bn_work> do I need `-n`?  normally when I do `-i`, I don't seem to need it?
[00:52:57] <yitz> p will print duplicates without -n
[00:54:13] <bn_work> note , the original input file ended something like this (I basically want to insert those 2 extra lines after L3 but before L4) https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/G44qKYh8/orginal_application.conf
[00:56:08] <bn_work> yitz: ah, you're right
[00:57:13] <bn_work> also, is my usage of `\n` correct here if I'm on a *NIX system?
[00:57:49] <yitz> You need multi-line support to make \n work
[00:58:06] <yitz> By default, sed operates on a stream - one line at a time
[00:58:34] <yitz> I don't think sed does multiline stuff without manually shuffling things into the pattern space or whatnot
[01:00:48] <bn_work> yitz: right, but I'm not trying to detect multi-line strings in this case, only substitute one in, which I think should be ok?  and doesn't require stronger stuff like awk/perl, right?

[01:06:57] <yitz> Oh. Yeah. You should be able to have a \n in the replacement
[01:07:12] <yitz> Try it and see? I don't recall how it handles meta chars
