[02:53:53] <celphi> how do i capture digits and commas but no trailing 0s. `100,100,10.001200`
[02:54:48] <JohnDoe2> meaning no decimals, or no trailing decimal places that are 0 ?
[02:55:27] <celphi> 40 = 40 | 41,003.320100 = 41,003.3201
[02:55:37] <JohnDoe2> ^[\d,.]+?(?=0+$)
[02:56:03] <celphi> wow you're fast
[02:56:21] <JohnDoe2> I know, that's why she left me üòû
[02:57:51] <celphi> lol
[02:58:03] <celphi> btw-- what would be the inverse JohnDoe2 
[02:58:17] <JohnDoe2> probably just 0+$
[03:00:35] <JohnDoe2> but really it should be much tighter. Say it should only kick in after a decimal point or something
[03:00:55] <JohnDoe2> otherwise 100,000 would also get clipped and that's a shame
[03:04:28] <celphi> JohnDoe2: 10,000.0000
[03:04:42] <celphi> how about i need w/o '.'
[03:04:50] <celphi> the inverse way you did
[03:05:32] <JohnDoe2> not quite the inverse... but basically get rid of decimals if it's all zeroes?
[03:05:51] <celphi> the 0+$ works great but i need to remove the `.` in 10,000.0000
[03:05:56] <JohnDoe2> \.0+$
[03:06:30] <JohnDoe2> it doesn't work great, it cuts 000 in 100,000 too :D
[03:06:42] <celphi> then that break "4,000,320.0010"
[03:07:06] <celphi> basically im doing string replace with "" on matches
[03:07:21] <celphi> JohnDoe2: 
[03:08:22] <celphi> and doesnt work with `  "10,000"`
[03:08:56] <JohnDoe2> celphi yes that's the idea, replace with nothing to get rid of it. Breaks that number how?
[03:09:12] <celphi> it becomes 10,
[03:09:48] <JohnDoe2> that's not possible
[03:09:54] <celphi> k
[03:09:55] *** Joins: Lope (~lope@user/lope)
[03:09:57] <JohnDoe2> \.0+$ is what you're using right?
[03:10:19] <celphi> if i use \.0 it doesnt work with the other matches
[03:10:38] <celphi> ok so if str_replace doesnt work what about with matching?
[03:10:57] <JohnDoe2> celphi if it doesn't work that means I didn't get what you want
[03:11:20] <JohnDoe2> maybe it's time to be less pro and use regex101.com to post an example of where it fails to do what you want it to :D
[03:12:18] <celphi> https://regex101.com/r/C1bAxy/1
[03:13:13] <celphi> but id rather to have inverse
[03:13:14] <JohnDoe2> https://regex101.com/r/C1bAxy/2
[03:13:15] <celphi> https://regex101.com/r/1gD1CG/1
[03:13:29] <celphi> but i need all those examples to work
[03:13:36] <JohnDoe2> what's the reverse?
[03:13:42] <celphi> the idea is this:
[03:14:18] <celphi> get rid of all trailing 0s that are right of decimal., and if the decimal is last character remove that too- keep all commas- -and get the inverse of that
[03:14:27] *** Quits: Lope (~lope@user/lope) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[03:14:50] <celphi> .0004 is exception because a number 1-9 makes the 0 significant
[03:14:54] <JohnDoe2> ok not sure what "and get the inverse of that" means - meaning keep the text?
[03:15:26] <celphi> inverse meaning --- i want to match the 0s and or decimals instead rather than match the other part
[03:15:59] <JohnDoe2> https://regex101.com/r/C1bAxy/3
[03:16:05] <JohnDoe2> you have a funny way of using inverse :D

[03:16:48] <JohnDoe2> üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[03:18:37] <celphi> really. it's just a marvel
[03:19:03] <celphi> img going to try and break it down
[03:22:15] <MrByte> <+JohnDoe2> Could you explain this regex? I mean what each part does?
[03:22:38] <OnlineCop> There's an explanation on the top-right of the page...
[03:22:54] <celphi> so i understand it all except for (?<=[1-9])
[03:24:20] <celphi> `/(?:\.|(?<=[1-9]))0+$/`   (?:...) means dont capture -- so the entire beginning he's not capturing in match., only the `0+$` is matched. then he has \. (literal period) OR (?<=[1-9]) not sure on last part
[03:25:04] <MrByte> thanks <celphi> 
[03:25:06] <JohnDoe2> welp my tab froze and took a pic before it crashed https://bugout.regex.ga/05c290cfa4e1a39c222a4905a135daff_crashed-sorry.png
[03:25:10] <celphi> prob a look ahead says it must me a 1-9 but again dont match because it's in (?:...)
[03:25:29] <celphi> oh nice ty
[03:26:15] <MrByte> thanks a lot <+JohnDoe2>
[03:26:23] <JohnDoe2> of course
[03:26:28] <celphi> positive lookbehind? i wonder why they call that it
[03:26:31] <celphi> *it that
[03:26:52] <celphi> i would have thought ahead ---- behind
[03:27:06] <JohnDoe2> positive because you assert something SHOULD be there
[03:27:27] <JohnDoe2> you can also have a negative lookbehind which asserts something SHOULD NOT be there
[03:29:31] <celphi> what about positive/negative lookahead?
[03:30:15] <MrByte> <+JohnDoe2> do you think they are covering good topics here? https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/regular-expression-introduction/table-of-contents?aid=7010c000002SNseAAG

[04:18:58] <bitlan> give me a second

[08:56:38] <Rahul> its kind of macros for new Excel
[08:57:16] <digitok> do you know if it can use captures
[08:57:35] <digitok> assuming it can, https://regex101.com/r/TyynDA/2
[08:57:36] <Rahul> i am not sure
[08:57:51] <digitok> if not, it'll be difficult
[08:58:25] <Rahul> ok let me run it and i will let you know
[08:58:25] <JohnDoe2> digitok right? doesn't that feel so backwards to capture in a lookahead and then match it? ew.
[08:58:51] <digitok> yea, what was the idea?
[08:59:17] <digitok> i mean doing that actually is a good thing in some cases, but didn't seem applicable there
[08:59:32] <digitok> it can be used to prevent backtracking in langs like python
[09:00:12] <JohnDoe2> just wanted to see what it feels like to abuse the regex engine in novel ways
[09:00:16] <digitok> lol
[09:00:18] <digitok> -_-
[09:00:23] <JohnDoe2> üòÜ
[09:01:04] <digitok> you must hate me :(
[09:01:39] <digitok> twice in a row you've ignored my msgs directed at you :'(
[09:01:39] <JohnDoe2> me? why would I?
[09:02:16] <JohnDoe2> oh the l,r&c thing
[09:02:19] <JohnDoe2> mah bad
[09:02:23] <digitok> :D
[09:03:36] <JohnDoe2> that's cool. If you like that you might also like setting up a transparent proxy which is a MITM so you can snoop on all the https traffic. See what your apps are sending and stuff. On a mobile phone it's particularly interesting
[09:03:51] <digitok> i'll keep it simple for now
[09:03:58] <JohnDoe2> üòâ
[09:04:31] <digitok> but i was blocking so much i felt like one of your ex's
[09:04:51] <digitok> ok maybe that's an exaggeration
[09:05:05] <Rahul> digitok no it does not use 
[09:05:13] <Rahul> captures
[09:05:55] <digitok> hm
[09:06:21] <digitok> you can see if this works, but i doubt it, https://regex101.com/r/TyynDA/3
[09:06:33] <digitok> otherwise i dunno how you'd do it
[09:07:37] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/TyynDA/4
[09:07:39] <Rahul> also it would just be one text
[09:07:42] <digitok> this would work if it supports lookahead
[09:07:46] <Rahul> i just gave 2 eamples
[09:07:53] <digitok> yea, it's still the same
[09:08:07] <digitok> /4 is more likely to work than /3
[09:08:47] <digitok> but if not, i don't know how you could do it since there are multiple emails
[09:10:03] <Rahul> the email is always between von and  Gesendet
[09:10:11] <Rahul> 3 worked
[09:10:15] <digitok> perfect
[09:10:16] <Rahul> let me check 4
[09:10:22] <digitok> 4 is unlikely
[09:10:30] <digitok> but worth checking
[09:10:49] <digitok> oh wait
[09:11:00] <digitok> it's 3 that was more unlikely
[09:11:02] <digitok> interesting
[09:11:10] <digitok> ah, so it probably uses .net regex
[09:11:15] <digitok> makes sense
[09:11:46] <digitok> i'd probably just use /4 anyway
[09:14:05] <Rahul> ok let me check
[09:38:00] <Rahul> in version 4
[09:38:13] <Rahul> it takes @ also digitok
[09:38:29] <Rahul> we just need after @

[14:32:46] <re101-skunk-59> Hello, I need to create a regex where it accept 14 numbers (from 0-9) but it has to not allow all 0
[14:37:26] <ifohancroft> What regex engine are you using?
[14:38:20] <re101-skunk-59> php
[14:39:35] <ifohancroft> [1-9]{14,14} does this work
[14:39:56] <ifohancroft> oh wait, you said 14 numbers do you mean like a number with 14 digits in length or?
[14:41:24] <re101-skunk-59> it has to be 14 lenght, only numbers and it has to accept all the combination except all zeros
[14:41:39] <ifohancroft> yeah, then [1-9]{14,14}
[14:41:41] <ifohancroft> then try*
[14:42:06] <re101-skunk-59> this one maybe doesn't accept any 0
[14:42:27] <re101-skunk-59> i'm trying the regex on "regex101" to see if it works
[14:42:44] <ifohancroft> Ah! You want to accept 0s, but not accept all zeroes
[14:42:52] <re101-skunk-59> yes
[14:43:11] <ifohancroft> well you may have to handle the all 0s part in PHP, but besides that then this should work: [0-9]{14,14}
[14:44:03] *** Quits: re101-dodo-12 (~re101-dod@103.15.252.183) (Quit: Client closed)
[14:44:37] <re101-skunk-59> the problem is that in this case it doesn't accept any 0, i need to accept all the combination of number except all zeros
[14:45:12] <ifohancroft> Look again at the last regex I wrote, it now accepts zeroes, it's 0-9

[21:51:16] <re101-coati-6> any ideas ?

[21:53:34] <re101-coati-6> i want it to check for all types of characters

[21:54:16] <re101-coati-6> but not if 1 it only have white spaces, 2 it only have numbers, 3 it only have  special characters

[22:01:26] <yitz> I'm having a hard time understanding your constraints. Does the above line sorta do what you want?
[22:02:57] <purplex> re101-coati-6: currently your regex doesn't accept spaces, and this does not look like a correct \d+\[ A-Za-z]+ syntax and it doesn't accept #$'-_

[22:05:30] <yitz> Nope. What must a string contain to be valid?
[22:05:57] <purplex> If i try to correct it https://regex101.com/r/p5yaxf/2 then it doesn't accept 1.) spaces, 2.) digits 3.) upper and lowercase letters, and 4.) #$'-_
[22:06:07] <re101-coati-6> it must not accept only white spaces , only special characters , only numbers
[22:06:11] <re101-coati-6> a combination of all
[22:06:43] <yitz> So ... it must contain a letter? Is that the constraint?
[22:07:23] <yitz> If it has a letter, then it does not contain "only white spaces , only special characters , only numbers"

[23:29:18] <re101-indri-44> <li>repaglinide can sometimes cause your BG to drop too low. </li>
[23:29:19] <re101-indri-44> <li>You can reduce this risk by eating on a regular schedule and eating extra carbs when you are more active than usual.</li>
