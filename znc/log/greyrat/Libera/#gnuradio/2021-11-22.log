[20:51:54] <jemius> Does GR enter undefined behavior when you produce more samples than requested by `int noutput_items`, passed to general_work()?
[20:55:18] <Notou[m]> When you return (or call `produce()` ) with a higher value than noutput_items, or when you put more data into the array?
[21:00:54] <Notou[m]> I just checked, there is no verification that the return value is indeed not above noutput_items, so the answer is yes to both options. It will tell gr to go read a location in the buffer that is filled with "something" that may not even be old samples.
[21:00:55] <funkylab[m]> <jemius> "Does GR enter undefined behavior..." <- not undefined, but buggy
[21:00:58] <funkylab[m]> exactly
[21:13:21] <funkylab[m]> you might be ending up modifying samples that the downstream block is still working on, as a side effect
[21:13:24] <Notou[m]> At least, in python, you cannot access outside input and output buffers.
[21:13:24] <funkylab[m]> hmmmm

[21:13:32] <Notou[m]> Might a check by the scheduler be useful?
[21:13:32] <funkylab[m]> ah if that's the case,  that's because we "put" a numpy array wrapper around the pointer to the raw ring buffer
[21:13:35] <funkylab[m]> but in C++ land everything is unchecked
[21:13:35] <Notou[m]> Yes
[21:13:41] <funkylab[m]> Notou[m]: I do think so. I don't think we'll unearth many bugs
[21:28:07] <Yamakaja[m]> A variation of that bit me a couple months ago where i consumed more samples than what was available. No crash, but veeeery weird behavior :D

[21:35:46] <funkylab[m]> I'm fine with saturating logic and a throw, that would allow downstream to finish what it's doing
[21:37:37] <willcode4[m]> I suppose these could help users find bugs faster. Same for consume. But the block has like already accessed memory it wasn't intended to at that point.

[22:02:34] <patchvonbraun[m]> This fits into a similar  category that I've alway been ambivalent about--"should I check the sanity of the pointers handed to me by my callers".   If I'm the kernel--yes, absolutely.  But if I'm just some random applications library, I should probably rely on the CPU/VM system to assert a SEGFAULT if I naively "believe" the pointers handed to me by my callers.    There are arguments for both sides.  Obviously, in a
[22:02:34] <patchvonbraun[m]> strongly-typed-and-bounds-checked language like Python, things are different.  But in C++/C ??
