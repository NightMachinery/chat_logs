[03:25:02] <ash_worksi> TimMc: so, what I meant was, to illustrate the _difference_ between android permissions and oauth grants (scopes?) github lists a single token for codesandbox.io. You can revoke it, you lose everything. Android you can revoke explicit permissions (do read this, don't write here, no camera access, etc)
[03:25:43] <ash_worksi> so if I wasnted to manage scopes that miopically on github, what architecture or organizational structure would you call that?

[07:14:23] <viva> gotta little catch 22 that i was hoping someone could help me work thru... i have a specific email address that i use for banking... and nothing else.. only banking... i get on it and retrieve a 2fa when logging into online bank. i use it for the bank account creation itself and for email alerts
[07:14:28] <viva> for balances and activities and things of that nature
[07:14:52] <viva> i would like to get a notice if something odd goes on with this email address... like a 2fa code gets sent for a login i didnt make
[07:15:04] <viva> but i also dont want this email address on my phone for obvious security reasons
[07:15:31] <viva> i thought perhaps email fowarding was the way to do it... but i didnt want codes being sent to an email address with a slightly weaker password
[07:15:44] *** Joins: x|z3r0 (~xz3r0@webhost44.com)
[07:16:02] <viva> should i create an email address that solely takes forwards from the banking email address and use that on my phone?

[07:16:12] <Alhazred> wouldnt you get a 2fa alert when someone attempts to use that email address

[07:16:45] <viva> well thats the thing some of my banks (specifically a credit union) doesnt have /strong/ 2fa, its a phone call.. so if i get sim swapped, im screwed
[07:16:54] <viva> some banks dont use 2fa at all
[07:17:06] <viva> or not necessarily banks but finance sites that i interact with
[07:17:08] <Alhazred> sure, of course, but that's up to you when you decide what bank to use...

[07:18:05] <viva> right but i dont have a hyptothetical perfectly featured bank that has all the needs in security that i desire, im constrained by certain practical limitations like location, qualification, etc.

[07:18:57] <viva> 2-3 banks/credit unions/finance sites that all have varying security models that mostly rely on email and DEFINITELY rely on email to alert for suspicious activity
[07:19:01] <Alhazred> 1) dont make an online account and just go to the bank to deal with stuff
[07:20:23] <Alhazred> 2) if you do make an online account, and you're using email, there should technically be an option to forward whatever email you get as you mentioned - however I still don't see how that's safer than just getting notifications from your bank's email
[07:21:06] <Alhazred> if you (understandably) dont want to have that email acc on your phone, you can always set up a hook on your computer that polls said alerts and sends you a message over your application of choice

[07:22:37] <BoBeR182> but part of #security
[07:23:29] <viva> well another question i had is how does #security feel about authy?
[07:23:54] <BoBeR182> I prefer open source TOPT tools
[07:23:58] <BoBeR182> like andOTP

[07:26:11] <viva> ok i was reading some stuff about authy and i keep seeing TOTP and im pretty sure im familiar with OTP, but what is TOTP? temporary one time password? because it seems to be being used as though its describing single use authorization codes to recover a MFA enabled acct after loss of 2fa
[07:26:14] <viva> authenticator access
[07:26:24] <BoBeR182> time based
[07:26:29] <BoBeR182> instead of HOTP
[07:26:33] <BoBeR182> where it's hardware based
[07:26:33] <viva> nvm its time based
[07:26:36] <viva> i see
[07:26:44] <BoBeR182> the standard is open
[07:26:51] <BoBeR182> RFC-XXXX
[07:26:51] <viva> HOTP would be things like blizzard communicator or w/e it was called back in the day?
[07:27:00] <BoBeR182> yea probably
[07:27:06] <BoBeR182> or some propriatary implementation
[07:27:42] <viva> man i wish i still had that thing, i used it once set it down and the couch literally swalloed it and i never saw it again... it would prob be valuable some day like the little tomagotchi things
[07:27:58] <viva> anyways, what do you call the one time use authorization codes?
[07:28:02] <viva> do those have an acronym?
[07:28:07] <viva> OTAC?
[07:28:18] <viva> SUAC? single use auth codes?

[13:46:09] <msa42[m]> labrador: let's call keepass a password manager, and what is presented here a password "deriver".
[13:46:17] <msa42[m]> a password manager will use an encrypted database, so everytime you add a new password the database must be updated and the file rewritten and encrypted on disk.
[13:46:20] <msa42[m]> a password derive on the other end will use an algorithm to generate the password in a deterministic manner from your passphrase and a "string", for example the name of the website.
[13:46:22] <msa42[m]> so there is absolutely nothing to store on disk or update when you register to a new website
[13:46:51] <msa42[m]> you can derive an infinite number of passwords from the same passphrase

[13:48:12] <labrador> msa42[m], thats cool and all. But is there an advantage to deriving passwords?
[13:48:17] <labrador> I think they might have less entropy

[13:55:29] <msa42[m]> labrador: you are absolutely right, in general if you derive password naively they have very low entropy. That's for example the case if you use the option `--sha` from `pwgen` naively (see the man page of pwgen for this option, it's a fun read)
[13:55:43] <msa42[m]> labrador: in this specific case, we use the SCRYPT algorithm to ensure we derive password with sufficient entropy

[16:45:24] <irelativism> hey sec, we are getting closer and closer to hyperbolaBSD \O/
[16:45:43] <irelativism> We hereby announce a new release of Hyperbola live image for Hyperbola GNU/Linux-libre. It is the first release with nondependence on D-Bus and many of the commonly used frameworks dropped.
[16:45:49] <irelativism> This version contains various bugfixes and notable performance

[16:46:17] <websec> ^ Hyperbola - News: Milky Way v0.4 release
[16:46:17] <irelativism> A copyleft alternative to linux kernel is of the upmost importance for our movement during current times. Cheers.

[16:49:54] <irelativism> we build upon OpenBSD work
[16:50:12] <irelativism> we bring some benefits from GNU side as well
[16:50:19] <irelativism> hyperc isone of them
[16:50:26] <irelativism> openrc for openbsd
[16:50:33] <irelativism> hyperman another ;)

[16:51:18] <savy_> actually i use illumos it fit very well for me

[18:11:53] <relipse> or you think someone could fake the data?
[18:12:42] <fuo[m]> if the API is internal and your threat model doesn't assume an attacker can compromise your host and do mitm or listen to the traffic then it'd be fine

[18:19:58] <piou> Also, just because an info is public doesn't mean it cannot be sensitive. For example say you're sending the URL to download the new version through that API. That may not be a secret, but if someone controls it they can induce the client into downloading a malicious update instead.

[19:10:51] <BigBitsAndNAS> https will go down before dns
[19:11:23] <fuo[m]> dns may be "simple" but the security is not, and I can't guarantee myself stability (I have a DNS server internally and sometimes it crashes due to request overloading)
[19:11:23] <fuo[m]> Also like I wrote before I do not have public port 53 (and can't afford forwarding via VPS etc)
[19:12:22] <TimMc> I've been using freedns.afraid.org.
[19:12:59] <TimMc> but I'll probably switch to using my domain registrar's API, since they also provide DNS service
[19:14:02] *** Joins: [itchyjunk] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470)
[19:14:04] <fuo[m]> also I'd still need to emit certs for https via DNS, and I don't think selfhosting would allow me to do that (I would as a minimum need to write a plugin if one does not exist)

[19:14:58] <BigBitsAndNAS> fuo security is not an issue. It only an issue if assuming cloud monsters are only ones to do it right
[19:15:32] <BigBitsAndNAS> There is free option for dns hosting but you should support small guys
[19:15:51] <BigBitsAndNAS> Do not justify cloud monsters just because free
[19:17:33] <fuo[m]> Security with dns IS an issue and I do not have time to mantain that as well. Also I trust cloudflare do it better than I do, they have a full time team to manage that.
[19:17:33] <fuo[m]> I understand that cloudflare should not get more market share, but not everyone has the time or skills to match their free offering
[19:18:14] <fuo[m]> If there are alternatives that MATCH the features I currently use and need I'd like to switch to them obv
[19:18:45] <BigBitsAndNAS> fuo what special feature?

[19:20:17] <fuo[m]> also their GUI is nice, I'd like not to have to edit a txt file to handle DNS with complicated records
[19:21:09] <MadCamel> That's pretty much my view. I don't have time to stay on top of every possible security issue with my setup. Especially with TLS best practices being such a moving target. Farm it out to cloudflare for free and firewall my port to their IP space only. Yes they could MITM me but that threat is much lower than a poorly maintained server.
[19:22:34] <fuo[m]> also in my case I do not even use their proxy since due to how I have DNS configured I'd leak my ip anyway (they do not allow https on all ports nor streaming videos etc, they'd ban you)

[19:29:24] <MadCamel> acme.sh can work with most DNS providers to make certbot work

[23:02:43] <jdr> Gotcha
[23:02:45] <moose> it is tapped by children tbh
[23:03:10] <moose> we have the lemonade stands and we have the governments, there's a few small business size rings out there

[23:03:58] <jdr> Easily.
[23:04:26] <moose> if someone were to come up with basically google's project zero, but totally malicious, and pay top dollar for sexy 0days, that'd do it

[23:05:13] <jdr> I never thought I would see the day, OR how stuff like this would unfold.
[23:05:17] <moose> but this group would need like a whole set of employees basically working for them, hacking stuff, who won't just take the data for themselves - that's the trouble
[23:05:42] <jdr> yep
[23:05:46] <moose> if you pay someone to breach say a bitcoin exchange worth $500m and pay them only $50k to do it... they're not gonna be happy
[23:06:05] <jdr> but those terms need to be set up front
[23:06:08] <moose> but also the work involved in laundering the funds and cashing out $500m in bitcoin is quite extensive, but people don't realize that
[23:06:11] <jdr> Just like a contractor bids a job.
[23:06:31] <moose> yeah the issue here is that contractors still swindle people and they do it less so because there is a legal framework that exists to protect consumers and businesses
[23:06:37] <moose> it's less workable in illicit activity

[23:07:34] <jdr> Maybe that whole segment will evolve
[23:07:36] <jdr> yesss
[23:07:40] <moose> the organization needs to vet its members, induct them, and know who they are

[23:10:10] <moose> you can extort someone to do more work for free, you can take their assets, you can conduct what is called paper terrorism, and you can of course harm them or those they care about

[23:12:36] <TimMc> jdr: Since I'm not entirely sure this got answered, yes, there have been a goodly number of extortion rackets over the years, usually something basic like "we're gonna DDoS you unless you pay protection money".

[23:14:15] <moose> jdr: Yeah there's apparently some legal options if you're being hacked. You can fire back in some circumstances in certain jurisdictions in some countries.
[23:14:26] <jdr> ahhh
[23:14:34] <moose> But of course, it's very limited and new.
[23:14:35] <jdr> For sure then
[23:14:43] <TimMc> moose: There's always... mmm... investigatory exploration...
[23:15:13] <moose> TimMc: Yeah, I mean who's to say that once they map that network drive to exfil data that they're not just a part of your network and consenting to control?
[23:15:24] <TimMc> "oh hmm, what's this IP that's hitting us, maybe if we port scan it we can figure out who's operating it... ah look, this port is open..."
[23:15:36] <TimMc> lol
[23:15:45] <TimMc> moose: clickwrap
[23:15:57] <moose> In the US there is a lovely exemption from CFAA that basically says if the system is unprotected then it's open for public use.
[23:16:10] <TimMc> "By exfiltrating data from these premises, you hereby consent to..."
[23:16:13] <moose> So port scanning and using a default un/pw is potentially legal.
[23:16:22] <jdr> wow
[23:16:29] <moose> or exploiting a known vulnerability, if the company was notified already, is potentially legal.

[23:16:39] <jdr> that would be like securing my house with a combination lock, but leaving the sticker on the back
[23:16:47] <TimMc> Hard to believe something as broad as the CFAA would have an exception like that.
[23:17:04] <moose> TimMc: It's from case law really, not necessarily written in the CFAA.
[23:17:09] <TimMc> hmm
[23:17:13] <piou> unprotected != badly protected
[23:17:36] <piou> a password shows intent of protection, no way attacking that flies in court
[23:17:40] <TimMc> Right, if there's evidence of someone trying to perform access control, but they fucked it up real bad, they still tried.
[23:17:49] <TimMc> and you have to respect that intent
[23:17:57] <moose> piou: The particulars I am remembering are about a company that received a report of a vuln, it went on to be responsibly disclosed, and they negligently did not fix it. The person who leveraged it was not able to be convicted because the company knew of the issue and had a memo saying they understood the risk and chose not to fix it.
[23:17:59] <TimMc> That's why DRM can be so shitty.
[23:18:34] <piou> moose: that's a very different story, and a vuln is a bug, there's no intent behind it
[23:18:44] <TimMc> moose: There's a fine line between "we don't think this is a vulnerability" and "we decline to fix this".
[23:18:52] <TimMc> and a conviction could hinge on that wording
[23:18:55] <moose> TimMc: The memo was internal, regardless.
[23:19:08] <moose> And the ruling was broad enough to include a lack of action as the precedent, not the memo.
[23:19:08] <piou> without knowing the actual vuln and context, nothing can be said from this story
[23:19:31] <TimMc> Yeah, I think I'd want to see this. I have a hard time squaring this with other case law.
[23:19:36] <piou> a broad ruling on a specific issue doesn't make a huge exception
[23:19:46] <piou> it makes a tiny one
[23:19:50] <TimMc> ...not that case law is always particularly consistent...
[23:20:06] <moose> piou: It makes a specific exception for the given circumstances, which happens to be a primary vector of intrusion.
[23:20:27] <piou> moose: you're the one broadening the circumstances
