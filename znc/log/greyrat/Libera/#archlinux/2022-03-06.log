[00:21:49] <naicam|ne> so a thing that pets my peeves is that when i have firefox open, and i click a link in another application, it bitches that firefox is already open instead of just opening a new tab -- is there anything to do about that?
[00:22:24] <Ghosthree3> something about a --remote-only bug iirc
[00:23:02] <naicam|ne> I see
[00:23:03] <Ghosthree3> havent run into it for a very long time now though, you shouldnt be having that issue
[00:23:21] <Ghosthree3> xdg-mime misconfiguration maybe?
[00:23:43] <naicam|ne> maybe so, ive been looking through it trying to figure out if it was that

[00:26:49] <jb1277976> yea

[00:27:58] <jb1277976> oh i was on freebsd also
[00:28:09] <talen> I feel that
[00:28:13] <talen> I used to hop around a lot

[00:29:01] <thrice> I like hte idea of gentoo a lot, but don't have the hardware to not be annoyed by big compiles
[00:29:08] <jb1277976> talen: the only reason why i don't use gentoo right now. is that you might break something after emerging. to much hassel

[00:34:29] <CarloWood> When will mesa 22 come more or less?
[00:34:43] <Ghosthree3> well rc3 just got released, and rc2 was about a month ago
[00:34:45] <Ghosthree3> so 'soon'
[00:34:56] <Ghosthree3> mesa22 is such a huge improvement, will be good when it finally drops
[00:35:13] <CarloWood> I'll wait I guess. I can work with extensions instead.
[00:35:44] <Ghosthree3> there's a mesa-git package, but its a bit messy, it replaces like 6 packages while being 1, so reverting it is not as simple as just installing mesa, you need to install those too

[04:04:44] <cgarz> MattMadness: for situations like that I generally use tmux
[04:05:17] <cgarz> but simple disowning can be done with "<command> & disown"
[04:05:42] <cgarz> nohup is another option
[04:06:05] <CarloWood> MattMadness: I'd use 'screen'
[04:06:54] <MattMadness> So, I can't if the process is already running?
[04:07:46] <CarloWood> https://hvivani.com.ar/2019/07/17/move-a-linux-running-process-to-a-screen-shell-session/
[04:07:48] <phrik> Title: Move a Linux running process to a screen shell session | Hernan Vivani's Blog (at hvivani.com.ar)
[04:07:48] <tirnanog> you could try using reptyr to reparent the process to an instance of tmux.
[04:07:50] <cgarz> might be able to use something like reptyr
[04:08:15] <cgarz> triple answer, noice
[04:09:15] <MattMadness> Alright, I'll try this, I hope this doesn't mess up the process
[04:09:51] <MattMadness> hm, ctrl z isn't working
[04:10:12] <MattMadness> maybe ngrok is preventing ctrl z from running
[04:10:20] <CarloWood> The advance of 'screen' is that you still have a terminal. For example, you run something in a terminal remotely (in screen) and you lose connection. You have to go home. At home you login again to the remote server and start screen again and pick up where you were left - including terminal output that was printed in the meantime.
[04:10:30] <CarloWood> If you don't need a terminal - then screen isn't needed of course.
[04:10:31] <MattMadness> (ngrok is what I'm trying to let out of this terminal session)
[04:10:37] <cgarz> tirnanog: I fixed that mount issue. I was testing it out by manual mounting so hadnt yet updated fstab with the old option, that would have been fine, but I forgot the specify mount path so mount was using the fstab options instead of the ones I was specifying at cmdline :facepalm:
[04:10:49] <tirnanog> cgarz: ah.

[04:22:45] <tirnanog> correct.
[04:23:35] <tirnanog> also, backgrounding a sub-process that was executing in the foreground wouldn't provide a cast-iron guarantee that closing the tty has no effect upon it.
[04:25:40] <tirnanog> in particular, if any of the standard file descriptors held by the sub-process are directed to that terminal, the disappearance of the terminal could be a problem.
[04:26:11] <MattMadness> I'm getting a "[-] Unable to open the tty in the child. Unable to attach to pid 29002: Permission denied" with reptyr, interestingly in htop the process has a red T, and in ps it has a Tl in the S column. What does that mean?

[05:05:43] <thurstylark> one big advantage imo: input and output config are the compositor's responsibility

[05:06:13] <agentlaidlaw> i've been using it exclusively since gnome 40 came out. i like it because i have less quirks with the compositor. performance impact with the compositor is far less too. and with games using xwayland, it actually give you advantages in window handling. like you don't have to worry about a game highjacking fullscreen and messing your resolution

[07:03:19] <_quantum> Docker is a non-starter.  Unsecure.
[07:03:22] <sheep> pacman -S docker; systemctl enable --now docker
[07:03:25] <sheep> same for podman
[07:03:55] <sheep> how is docker unsecure compared to podman?
[07:03:56] <thurstylark> wait, are you wanting arch to host, or arch in a container?

[07:05:31] <phrik> Title: Kubernetes - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[07:05:38] <jmariondev> the theme of arch is build-it-yourself. if you don't want to tinker and home-grow your cluster, you should look at managed kubernetes products

[07:06:43] <sheep> these both are pretty short and they don't look like they would take more than 10 minutes to do
[07:07:04] <jmariondev> yeah, though it's helpful to come back once you've gotten your feet wet and try building it yourself. there's no better way to learn how it all works together
[07:07:08] <_quantum> Docs are all over the place, and don't always reflect the real experience.
[07:07:16] <thurstylark> wat
[07:07:19] <thurstylark> just look at the wiki
[07:07:31] <sheep> the instructions on the wiki look good to me

[07:09:02] <_quantum> I have used the Arch wiki many times and indeed it is good.  But an incisi=ve response like the above is what I'm here for.

[07:14:02] <_quantum> There's a Grouchy McGrouchbucket who runs the IRC channel who I just can't do with.  And After asking in #fedora whether it is stable enough for production, got to emphatic YES', so like a dumbass I converted all my servers and herd of VMs to Fed.  But it's a rolling trainwreck for anyone who puts it to serious use.  I suspect my YES' were Jr. High kids posting on their laptops in class.
[07:14:24] *** Joins: purpzie (~purpzie@user/purpzie)
[07:14:55] <jmariondev> Anecdotally, I use Fedora CoreOS with much success in production, but I suspect the CoreOS part sets it apart from "normal" Fedora
[07:15:07] <_quantum> I've run CentOS for 18  years but it's discontinued.
[07:15:13] <jmariondev> That said, if you're used to RHEL-isms, Fedora is probably the next best bet
[07:16:03] <_quantum> Fed is unstable for serious use.  Idc if CERN etc use it.  I feel sorry for them.
[07:16:09] <masoudd> that must be the worst reason I've seen someone switch from a distro
[07:16:30] <_quantum> I have to doubt your judgment then.
[07:16:37] <masoudd> someone was mean to me. so I'll retool my whole infra lol
[07:17:10] <_quantum> Yeah, you don't know the whole story.

[07:30:33] <jmariondev> probably better to run the ugly perl mess in a container anyway
[07:30:36] <_quantum> Docker requires a master damon running as root to control all containers.  Podman has no such requirement and can run rootless.
[07:31:18] <thurstylark> yeah, well, makepkg runs functions from a PKGBUILD with fakeroot and then pacman installs the resulting package as root, so...
[07:31:23] <thurstylark> pretty similar
[07:31:55] <_quantum> Any distro does that.  But it's transient, not like a container.

[14:05:51] <woodwose> it's hilarious that the pipewire folks call it pebcak when I didn't change anything myself other than updating to 0.3.48
[14:05:52] <teraflops> old issue, not related to latest package
[14:06:11] <teraflops> (the bt one)
[14:07:12] <dmc> woodwose, bisecting is a great practice to learn
[14:07:27] <Warepire> woodwose: A bisect means to install every change revision (not package version) between 0.3.47 and 0.3.48, a tool called git-bisect will help optimize the process. see "man git-bisect" for more information
[14:07:28] <woodwose> it depends on what one's priorities are
[14:08:09] <Warepire> If it's an upstream issue and they do not believe so, a bisect is the best way to make that issue progress
[14:08:19] <woodwose> sometimes a user just wants to use a fucken distribution and not become a dev themselves
