[12:38:01] <jotham> is that a fresh linux meme
[12:38:03] <jotham> plz
[12:38:41] <jotham> spent all weekend trying to figure out what parts of our business are on fire from the lol4j 
[12:38:53] <markuskj> seems like a very sophisticated meme
[12:38:58] <markuskj> it's like the jazz of memes
[12:39:01] <Renderwww> but java is secure, why would there be a fire?
[12:39:20] <jotham> found this one thing that scans all the imap mail we process (like a couple of hundred businesses + all staff) and it was vulnerable 
[12:39:23] <jotham> shot it in the head
[12:39:44] <jotham> looks like no one had got round to sending it via mass email yet, or was being caught by spam filters
[12:39:59] <jotham> that would have been fairly bad
[12:40:14] <jotham> there is java fucking everywhere

[12:59:15] <jotham> haha no but i read it and thought it was a fun idea
[13:05:24] <ERROH> couple months ago we had an net outage and redis wouldn't let new connection somehow
[13:05:31] <ERROH> admins didn't want to restart it
[13:05:42] <ERROH> > its uptime is over 5 years, we're sorry
[13:05:47] <jotham> haha wtf
[13:05:55] <jotham> we have a 60 day rule for uptime at work
[13:06:04] <ERROH> so we restarted everything around and it finally started accepting shit
[13:07:02] <ERROH> i had such rule back when i was admining

[13:13:06] <ERROH> i think loltassian is tiering performance and your employer cheapened out
[13:13:26] <ERROH> at last work jira was terribly slow, don't really care at this one
[13:13:28] <Renderwww> afaik they don't use atlassian servers but their own
[13:13:52] <ERROH> jira needs shitloads of resources
[13:13:52] <Renderwww> anyways, I click things and it takes 10 seconds to load
[13:14:22] <jotham> if anything has elastic in its name
[13:14:30] <ERROH> we even moved our planning to day before because all teams finishing sprints at the same time was making it crash
[13:14:31] <jotham> you suddenly need 2+ 32gig ram vms
[13:14:47] <jotham> even if you have just lolwhut as a single string in the cluster
[13:14:58] <ERROH> jira uses ES?

[13:19:02] <Renderwww> last time I tried anything pwa I was bummed out that you can't just send arbitrary request to arbitrary sites. So you can't scrap shit from other webpages directly
[13:19:10] <Renderwww> all because muh, scurity!
[13:19:27] <jotham> cors same origin header shit right
[13:19:32] <Renderwww> yeah
