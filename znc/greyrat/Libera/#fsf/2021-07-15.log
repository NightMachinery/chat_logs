[07:36:45] <jxself> Those that make things need to ask for certification; the FSF doesn't go seek it out. So: They never asked or they did but it failed the certification process.
[07:37:10] <jxself> We'll never know which of those two it is, as the FSF doesn't talk about the ones they reject, only those that get certified.
[07:38:48] <jxself> If you think RepRap could meet the RYF criteria you can always encourage the project to apply.

[07:57:22] <dragestil> tpefreedom: AIUI the scripts blocked by librejs on these software intended to be free (like invidious and peertube) are probably free, but not labelled free
[07:58:17] <dragestil> tpefreedom: I would dig a bit about what are the offending scripts and check their licenses on the invidious repo
[07:58:52] <tpefreedom> Do you know of any instances that don't require any nonfree software?
[07:59:36] <dragestil> not I know of, but you can let librejs block the scripts and use the instances without problem
[08:00:01] <dragestil> that way your freedom is not violated and you get to use invidious
[08:00:33] <dragestil> unless there's something you can't do without the blocked scripts?

[14:41:28] <Armand> Some of the "correct" answers are either entirely wrong, or plain historically inaccurate.
[14:42:39] <kompowiec2__> You mean the famous problem with slavery history?
[14:43:04] <Armand> That's certainly one point. lol
[14:44:05] <kompowiec2__> Well, I have always avoided history other than IT because I cannot verify historical facts
[14:44:18] <kompowiec2__> so I only have rudimentary knowledge
[14:44:19] <Armand> "I wasn't there..."
[14:45:32] <kompowiec2__> When I read about the history of computers, there is a lot of documentation, records, and even all the hardware. It's easy to verify
[14:47:12] <Armand> Aye
[14:48:38] <Armand> That's why I like working on the Z80..
[14:48:54] <Armand> Like, I'm drawing up a modified SMS2..
[14:49:23] <Armand> It's so easy to find which parts are used in which versions of the board.. and what you can replace/upgrade.
[14:50:06] <kompowiec2__> Sure

[23:48:44] <ggoes> yeah, i'm not sure about the term "illiterate" either but the general suggestion is a good one. at the same time i'd hope that if the "reason for using free software" in step 2 is strong enough, their tech literacy would improve gradually as they went further on
[23:49:31] <zleap> indeed
[23:49:38] <zleap> hence i suggesed digital divide
[23:49:51] <zleap> which covers people who have not used tech but also those who can't afford it

[23:50:47] <zleap> over here in the UK the qr codes for the covid track and trace system assume you have (or rather can afford a smart phone) many older people have basic phones,  they just want to make calls for example

[23:53:06] <ggoes> correct
[23:53:47] <zleap> i do remember someone on the libreplanet list mentioning he / she runs computer sessions for people
[23:55:08] <Kelp> My tech illiterate grandma loves linux. I don't know why people think that linux is difficult 
[23:56:17] <tpefreedom> maybe it's that you can do almost everything you would want/need from a tty.
[23:56:55] <tpefreedom> The only things you truly need a gui for are specialized apps like blender/inkscape/etc.... and some games.
[23:57:10] <Noisytoot> Would it be better to use "~~~~" to sign comments?
[23:57:18] <ggoes> on the wiki, yes
[23:57:21] <Anon_> Kelp: its a myth which comes from long time ago

[23:57:28] <Ranger77> I can't persuade my parents to use Linux.
[23:57:49] <Noisytoot> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext#Signing_comments
[23:57:58] <zleap> Kelp, I have just installed a 2nd hard disk on my system,  trying to get debian to just write to it seems far more long winded than needed
[23:58:02] <Anon_> trying to live boot some linux and opening a browser and text editor with GUI is almost enough to convince most of people
[23:58:08] <zleap> i should not have to edit fstab,  type at the command line
[23:58:16] <Kelp> I installed Deja dup on my grandmas computer (the gnome backup tool). so now my grandma can just open the program and click backup 
[23:58:23] <Noisytoot> Is there a way to replace signatures not using ~~~~ with ~~~~ signatures (on comments from another user)?
[23:58:24] <Kelp> 2 clicks and it just backs up all her files for her
[23:58:29] <Ranger77> If the user want a special program that do not have alternative on Linux is a problem.
[23:58:35] <Noisytoot> zleap, I think chown -R on the mount directory should work
[23:59:00] <Kelp> And to import her photos she can just plug in her phone, click import photos with qwenview. hit import then finish
[23:59:05] <Anon_> Ranger77: yes it can help sometimes, a good question it how to proceed in those cases
[23:59:10] <Kelp> She said "wow it's so simple"
[23:59:15] <zleap> Noisytoot, my point is more that if we are trying toget people off windows to Linux,  doing anything at the command line should not be needed
[23:59:36] *** Joins: arielcostas (~Ariel@50.216.117.91.dynamic.reverse-mundo-r.com)
[23:59:44] <zleap> for us,  the command line is 2nd nature,  for the average user lets not assume that
[23:59:45] <Kelp> everything i do in the command line i can do with a gui
[23:59:55] <zleap> Kelp, that is how it should be
