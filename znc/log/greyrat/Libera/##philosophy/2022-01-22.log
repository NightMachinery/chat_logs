[00:29:37] <ProfSimm> The internet is fresh.
[00:29:47] <causative_> alignment isn't a good thing, another word for that is "group-think"

[00:30:13] <ProfSimm> causative_: group-think is a tool like anything else. There's good and bad in it.
[00:30:19] <ProfSimm> causative_: and it's a gradation
[00:30:31] <ProfSimm> Without group-think we wouldn't even have a common language
[00:30:38] <causative_> you have options: 1. hate anyone different. 2. make everyone the same so you don't have to hate anyone different. ("alignment") 3. learn to talk respectfully with people who don't think the same as you
[00:30:48] <causative_> option 3 is by far superior
[00:30:52] <causative_> option 2 is really just a version of option 1
[00:30:54] <ProfSimm> Everyone would be like "I have the better language" and we'd never agree how to speak to each other
[00:31:23] <causative_> not the same, choosing standards of communication is unlike choosing beliefs
[00:31:51] <causative_> standards of communication are inherently arbitrary, if we agree on them there's little problem whatever we agree on
[00:32:07] <ProfSimm> Alignment is not purely about beliefs. It's about complementation, cooperation. Incentives exist for this beyond beliefs. It can be simply synergistic.
[00:32:10] <causative_> beliefs are non-arbitrary and if everyone agrees on the wrong belief, everyone is just wrong, and that's very bad for society
[00:32:33] <ProfSimm> causative_: more often than not, being wrong together is better than being right individually
[00:32:40] <ProfSimm> causative_: I know it sounds wrong, but it's right
[00:32:44] <causative_> it's wrong
[00:32:46] <mycroftiv> profsimm: in practice for sure
[00:32:53] <causative_> if each person is right individually then everyone is right together
[00:33:02] <ProfSimm> causative_: well I knew you'd think that. But it's right
[00:33:13] <causative_> groupthink is about beliefs, not about communication standards or cooperation
[00:33:19] <ProfSimm> causative_: well that's the trick, there's more than one way of being right
[00:33:21] <wootehfoot> causative_, but when a kid is bad at maths, it's not PC to blame it on the kid, as it's "obviously" the number system's fault, by extension standards of communication (mathematics being the universal one) are becoming a blurred with the belief border
[00:33:32] <ProfSimm> causative_: and 'individually' implies incompatible "rightness"
[00:33:36] <causative_> ProfSimm, beliefs motivate actions
[00:33:48] <causative_> if everybody is wrong together, then everybody together will take an action that doesn't benefit them
[00:33:51] <causative_> that will harm everybody
[00:34:16] <causative_> if we want to have right actions, we have to first find the right - objectively right - beliefs, to motivate the right actions
[00:34:26] <ProfSimm> causative_: the trap you fall into is thinking right/wrong is absolute
[00:34:27] <causative_> "may the truth move you"
[00:34:36] <ProfSimm> It's relative
[00:34:39] <mycroftiv> sometimes people are wrong and it doesnt matter much because constellations of stars vs sky animals makes little actionable difference
[00:34:46] <causative_> ProfSimm, I don't believe even *you* believe that
[00:34:53] <causative_> why are you telling me I'm wrong and falling into traps if it's all relative?
[00:34:58] <ProfSimm> causative_: you have no idea how much i believe that
[00:35:06] <causative_> by contradicting me, you're asserting your views are absolutely better than mine
[00:35:18] <causative_> your own view thereby defeats itself
[00:35:53] <ProfSimm> causative_: well my belief is that things are relative. That is an absolute belief I have, but I'm not absolute myself. So technically that's also relative. But I'd argue about it, yes.
[00:36:13] <mycroftiv> why cant some things be relative and some things absolute? thats how it works in math
[00:36:23] <causative_> ProfSimm, that made about as much sense as "the set of all sets that do not contain themselves"
[00:36:44] <mycroftiv> you have the axioms of ZFC and there are multiple models. the theorems of ZFC are true in all models. some things are true in some models and not in others, so they are model-relative
[00:36:53] <causative_> so it's okay for you to make absolute statements but because you're making them they're relative statements which is okay in an absolute sense but only in a relatively absolute sense, did I get all that?
[00:36:54] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: math is self-consistent (it's trying) but it doesn't imply it's consistent with an alternative quantitative system
[00:37:16] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: in other words, it's also relative, it's only "absolute" internally, to itself
[00:37:24] <mycroftiv> profsimm: even within a single formal system of math there are infinite different consistent models often. this is true even of the simple natural numbers
[00:37:46] <ProfSimm> causative_: you're very close to getting it

[00:38:59] <causative_> ProfSimm, this is like that line from "who's on first"
[00:39:01] <mycroftiv> relative to a given set of internal perceptions, many different external universes could have generated them. contrariwise, given a single external universe, multiple observers with different perceptual apparatus could be at a given point in spacetime with different perceptual worlds
[00:39:04] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: I think most people think if we meet an alien civilization we'd be exchanging digits of pi and so on
[00:39:18] <causative_> ProfSimm, you can't build a philosophy on nonsensical self-contradiction
[00:39:54] <inhahe_> ProfSimm: i'm not a mathematician, but my impression is that the fundamental axioms of math could be anything you can imagine (at least that's self-consistent), but somehow the ones we chose that we call math are way more effective
[00:39:59] <ProfSimm> causative_: I could straighten out what I mean, but I don't think you're open to the idea there are no absolute truths, so I'm destined to fail. So I'm kinda messing around.
[00:40:18] <inhahe_> and their effectivity could maybe make them 'truer' in some way
[00:40:53] <mycroftiv> even in the simplest formal mathematics, peano naturals, there are infinte different models and many have 'nonstandard' elements. all of our experiential worlds are like 'nonstandard models' of external reality i think
[00:41:06] <mycroftiv> they are different but all satisfy the axioms imposed
[00:42:07] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: I think question is how deep the rabbit hole goes. Are all axioms this world is built on, objectively, contextual, rather than absolute.
[00:42:48] <mycroftiv> good question, maybe its truly impossible to tell from the inside, and we do go mad trying to get outside the universe to see it as a whole, i dunno
[00:42:57] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: and maybe is there a reason behind those axioms, or are they just arbitrary constraints so things happen, rather than chaos.

[00:49:09] <ProfSimm> causative_: inhahe_ mycroftiv I think folks we don't need to argue if we think different or the same. I mean clearly it's a mix of both.
[00:49:46] <mycroftiv> profsimm: the argument is partly about whether reality itself is definitive or flexible, to me. i believe in mathematical flexibility of both reality and mind and universe
[00:49:55] <causative_> inhahe_, a reasonable person would be able to realize things like "well, I only believe X because I was brought up in a certain way, and you believe Y because you were brought up in a different way, and simply the way you or I was brought up is not a sufficient justification, so we need to look at more rational justifications for X or Y"
[00:49:55] <ProfSimm> Our mental models are predisposed by genetics, culture and environment, and then also chance. So it's a mix of "same" "different" and "bizarrely unique"
[00:50:11] <mycroftiv> to me formal mathematics argues against views of definitive objective discoverable single truth
[00:50:33] <causative_> people are caught in a trap where they think a certain way not because of good justifications but because they were raised that way - but it's an escapable trap, with enough time and evidence anyone can gather wisdom
[00:50:55] <causative_> and wisdom converges
[00:51:18] <mycroftiv> thats a topological assumption about reality mathematical structure i find unwarranted
[00:51:31] <ProfSimm> causative_: programmers have a saying "everyone else's code is crap". And unfortunately we do this with people's beliefs. Everyone else is kinda stupid unless they think like me.

[00:53:26] <causative_> mycroftiv, I don't know what you think about ultrafilters relative to the mind, but if we assume people are *basically reasonable* - that with enough evidence repeated enough times they'd be able to learn - then it seems intuitive that we'd eventually come to the same conclusions

[00:56:27] <mycroftiv> causative_: im sure not trying to provide magic pixie dust people can use to claim that 2+2=5 or ignore objective measurements or anything like that. in our physical shared world on earth of course stuff is generall 'definitive' and we can agree rationally
[00:56:44] <inhahe_> causative_: it seems to me that your belief that everyone essentially thinks the same way or that everyone who's reasonable would come to the conclusion reflects a viewpoint that your own way of thinking is the only valid one.
[00:57:22] <inhahe_> i think there's a wider array of modes of assimilating truth that are valid
[00:57:26] <mycroftiv> i feel like causative is really focused on things like 'how do we measure a hole and figure out what sized planks for the building foundation' or generalizations of issues like that, practical things
[00:57:47] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: anyway my point is math is a model where we use facts of the model to map onto reality like little hooks our mind hooks onto real objects. We identify distinct cows and hook them with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... It's a mapping
[00:57:52] <mycroftiv> and in that context its a pretty unassailable view
[00:58:04] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: cows themselves are not inherently countable

[00:58:18] <causative_> mycroftiv, well, if something *can't* be related to a physical fact, then it's difficult to say it's meaningful at all
[00:58:21] <mycroftiv> profsimm: of course, mathematical structures themselves are generalized precise metaphors
[00:58:42] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: in that sense though math is itself a tiny universe we made and teach to each other.
[00:58:46] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: it exists in our culture.
[00:58:55] <ProfSimm> And in our minds
[00:59:07] <ProfSimm> A universe with specific rules.
[00:59:25] <mycroftiv> causative_: i understand what you mean but i think we dont gain a lot by rducing ideas like 'the world of imagination' to physical brain states when we are talking about things
[00:59:36] <causative_> mycroftiv, note that mathematics *can* be related to physical facts, e.g. "it is possible to write code that Mizar accepts as a valid proof of X" - the code, and Mizar, are physical things
[00:59:52] <inhahe_> experience isn't necessarily limited to experience of the physical. meaning of a statement isn't dependent on being physical, per se, but on linkin to experience.
[01:00:15] <mycroftiv> profsimm: yea i study philosophy of math really seriously, i recommend the 'exploring the frontiers of incompleteness' seminar materials to really dive deep, and stanford encyclopedia of philosophy articles on lots of math issues
[01:00:43] <causative_> "Consider what effects, which might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object." - C.S. Peirce
[01:01:24] <mycroftiv> profsimm: http://logic.harvard.edu/efi.php and https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/large-cardinals-determinacy/ that kinda thing

[01:02:29] <mycroftiv> causative_: in mathematics theres this problem where we know that almost all objects are 'unthinkable' in the sense that we only have finite brainstates available and there are way too many real numbers for us to have a brainstate for each
[01:03:18] *** Joins: Glassbox (~Glassbox@34.162.189.80.dyn.plus.net)
[01:03:20] <mycroftiv> so mathematical objects 'exist' in some way, to whatever extent they do, which is very hard to reconcile with physical representationalism in some ways
[01:04:14] <mycroftiv> this is why some mathematicians like Woodin become actual Platonists, because the math seems too real to them to not have independent existence

[01:04:40] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: one of the most curious things ever would be to see how much our mental models are convergent to those of aliens living on a similar planet as ours
[01:04:59] <mycroftiv> and a lot of people feel something like this in a very strong intuitive way, Kant did for instance, although he was also kind of notoriously wrong by thinking Newton/Euclid was the inherent form of thought
[01:05:00] <ProfSimm> mycroftiv: I'm ready for their models to be strikingly similar, or vastly different.
[01:05:29] <mycroftiv> yea i try to simulate aliens thinking about me thinking about them a lot and have conversations
[01:06:02] <ProfSimm> One thing that shapes out mental model is our senses. Not just out mind.
[01:06:40] <ProfSimm> But the mind is the biggest hign.
[01:06:51] <ProfSimm> We can teach crows to do very basic geometry and math
[01:06:59] <ProfSimm> How they see it is unclear though
[01:09:24] <inhahe_> mathematical objects don't exist outside of our imagination
[01:10:26] <inhahe_> the idea that they're bigger than what we think is just that we can keep generating more thoughts about them that couldn't have been any other way
[01:11:27] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: strictly speaking that's 100% right. But if we meet an alien civilization and we see they largely have reinvented the same math principles, it might suggest something more fundamental
[01:11:29] <inhahe_> for example, the decimal expression of pi is us applying an algorithm with a loop in it
[01:11:43] *** Joins: ttree (~ttree0@c-73-97-116-42.hsd1.wa.comcast.net)
[01:12:23] <inhahe_> ProfSimm: yeah, maybe. that goes back to what i said earlier: [16:09] <inhahe_> ProfSimm: i'm not a mathematician, but my impression is that the fundamental axioms of math could be anything you can imagine (at least that's self-consistent), but somehow the ones we chose that we call math are way more effective [16:10] <inhahe_> and their effectivity could maybe make them 'truer' in some
[01:12:23] <inhahe_> way
[01:12:54] <inhahe_> the implication being that they came to the same mathematical system because it's effective
[01:14:49] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: there's some limited evidence in ANN that they have a knack for splitting things into objects. Because they technically train themselves to see patterns, and objects are patterns.
[01:15:04] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: once you recognize patterns, you have this notion of "number of instances of that pattern"
[01:15:10] <ProfSimm> And scale, rotation, eventually.
[01:15:22] <ProfSimm> and maybe math might re-emerge through this.
[01:15:25] <ProfSimm> Simply the way we think
[01:15:32] <ProfSimm> And all neural networks think
[01:16:58] <inhahe_> patterns aren't necessarily objects, they can be similarities among objects
[01:17:13] <ProfSimm> Patterns are objects, but objects are patterns
[01:17:21] <ProfSimm> Typo
[01:17:28] <ProfSimm> Patterns are not objects, but objects are patterns*
[01:18:26] <inhahe_> i think ann's basically train themselves to see specifically the types of patterns that are smeared across many objects
[01:18:51] <inhahe_> and the only reason objects exist in that sentence is because ann's work by us feeding them objects that we already separated ourselves
[01:19:36] <inhahe_>  i don't think it's necessary to appeal to some neurological feature to see how the continuum of nature lends itself to conceiving of separate objects
[01:19:38] <inhahe_>  for example
[01:19:40] <inhahe_> take a cow
[01:19:46] <ProfSimm> You can count patterns that aren't "objects" per se.
[01:19:53] <ProfSimm> You can count the dots on a ladybug
[01:20:10] <inhahe_> there may not be an absolute separation between them, but they exist in clumps of atoms that are close together and more distant between cows
[01:20:34] <inhahe_> ProfSimm: yes, but ann's probably don't do that
[01:20:57] <inhahe_> and we don't usually do taht
[01:21:01] <ProfSimm> Well ANN's do what helps them survive the selection
[01:21:24] <ProfSimm> But the point is they tend to focus around pattern recognition

[10:31:17] <Ungwelian> A paradox may well be just a problem of conceptualization.
[10:31:50] <inhahe_> Ungwelian: well it's more likely a proof by contradiction
[10:32:00] <p0indexter> aaand there are paradoxes
[10:32:20] <inhahe_> Ungwelian: because the theory has been tested
[10:33:01] <inhahe_> Ungwelian: and it's so self-consistent that there's not really another way to formulate it that doesn't limit the speed of light
[10:33:27] <inhahe_> at least that's my impression
[10:33:48] <Ungwelian> So basically some people have cooked up a theory, and that theory is now so set in stone, that chipping away any point would crash it like a house of cards.
[10:33:57] <Ungwelian> This reminds me of the Catholic Church :)
[10:34:36] <inhahe_> well, if you want to chip it away, you have to at least have a theoretical argument
[10:34:48] <inhahe_> it's not impossible
[10:35:15] <Ungwelian> The simplest being, there's no God delivering punishments for breaking the light speed limit.
[10:35:23] <inhahe_> nobody said there is
[10:35:33] <inhahe_> but we observe that there are laws and limitations in the world
[10:35:38] <inhahe_> this is one of them

[10:50:52] <inhahe_> p0indexter: it's spooky, but calling it action at a distance is a misunderstanding
[10:50:56] <inhahe_> it's tempting
[10:51:05] <p0indexter> there are conflicts between gr and qm and every physicist knows about this
[10:51:29] <inhahe_> p0indexter: they're not compatible with each other in the sense that they can't be integrated into one theory
[10:51:38] <inhahe_> that's not the same as them contradicting each other
[10:52:21] <p0indexter> semantics fail
[10:52:59] <inhahe_> even if they do contradict each other in some subtle ways, the limitation of the speed of light is not one of them
[10:54:21] <p0indexter> things can occur at rates faster than light....that is not the same as objectswith mass moving faster than light....information has no mass therefore....
[10:55:33] <inhahe_>  p0indexter: no, the speed of light is the speed of causality
[10:55:59] <inhahe_> that's why light travels at a limited speed and in a wave despite there being no medium
[10:56:47] <p0indexter> aand fyi...the quote was "spooky action at a distace" words chosen by Einstein including the word "distance"
[10:57:37] <inhahe_> p0indexter: i know.
[10:57:48] <inhahe_> it's not action.
[10:57:58] <inhahe_> not action at a distance anyway
[10:58:53] <p0indexter> does the word instantainious mean anything to you
[10:59:04] <inhahe_> sure
[10:59:25] <p0indexter> entanglement
[10:59:41] <inhahe_> entanglement isn't causal interaction, instantaneous or otherwise.
[11:00:01] <p0indexter> light in not instantainious
[11:00:47] <inhahe_> i know
[11:00:55] <inhahe_> because causality has a speed limit
[11:01:48] <Ungwelian> That still doesn't make sense in a relativistic universe.
[11:01:53] <p0indexter> enanglment happens faster than light
[11:01:56] <inhahe_> Ungwelian: why not?
[11:02:04] <Ungwelian> I said already :P
[11:02:14] <inhahe_> i don't remember it
[11:02:19] <Ungwelian> <Ungwelian> Because you can push bit by bit.
[11:02:19] <Ungwelian> <Ungwelian> And therefore attain greater speed in relation to a given object.
[11:02:26] <Ungwelian> There's no absolute center point.
[11:02:37] <Ungwelian> Rather, center point is by decision.
[11:02:48] <inhahe_> Ungwelian: i answered that though
[11:03:00] <p0indexter> Ungwelian: thats because a relativistic univers relates to general relativity and entanglment relates to quantum mechanics
[11:03:26] <inhahe_> p0indexter: entanglement is correlation
[11:04:03] <Ungwelian> From our POV, for example, we're quite still on Earth.
[11:04:13] <Ungwelian> Yet Earth goes pretty fast around the sun.
[11:04:14] <pussipupu> Galilean physics is a relativity compliant model
[11:04:22] <Ungwelian> And the whole solar system travels too.
[11:04:34] <pussipupu> entanglement doesn't allow data transmission faster than light
[11:04:35] <p0indexter> entanglment occurs faster than light
[11:04:45] <Ungwelian> Yet from the POV of something that would travel at the same speed and direction as the solar system, both are still.
[11:05:10] <inhahe_> Ungwelian: what i said about how increasing speed increases inertia was a simplification. it works even though motion is relative. you have to study the theory to see how it all fits together
[11:05:15] <inhahe_> Ungwelian: it involves time dilation
[11:05:22] <Ungwelian> More cooking.
[11:05:53] <Ungwelian> Doesn't it ring any alarm bells, when "professionals" start speaking about time and space themselves bending?
[11:06:04] <Ungwelian> It violates Plato's division of particulars and universals.
[11:06:18] <inhahe_> Ungwelian: truth is stranger than fiction. however, the bending of spacetime is just a way of modeling it
[11:06:24] <inhahe_> Ungwelian: you don't have to interpret it that way

[11:34:54] <p0indexter> youy are missing my point
[11:34:58] <inhahe_> if it were true and false at the same time, it would be logically self-contradictory and hence couldn't be modeled mathematically

[11:59:05] <p0indexter> I_Am_M00t: you are generalizing just slightly
[11:59:09] <I_Am_M00t> not by a lot
[11:59:17] <I_Am_M00t> there is a certain responsibility to moderate content on all sites

[12:00:01] <p0indexter> is twitter far right?
[12:00:09] <inhahe_> twitter isn't free speech
[12:00:16] <I_Am_M00t> at some point it was, maybe
[12:00:36] <I_Am_M00t> recently they started taking moderation more seriously
[12:00:42] <inhahe_> twitter is too popular to be only alt right though
[12:00:48] <p0indexter> so then let me ask the following question...
[12:01:33] <I_Am_M00t> a site that has no filters, is far-right by design
[12:01:54] <inhahe_> why can't they just be pro free speech?
[12:02:02] <p0indexter> if all free speech platform are right wing is free speech bad and needs to be censored
[12:02:03] <I_Am_M00t> because it's a false concept
[12:02:16] <I_Am_M00t> it's ambiguous
[12:02:52] <p0indexter> so you are anti free speech
[12:02:55] <I_Am_M00t> no
[12:02:58] <p0indexter> interesting
[12:02:59] <I_Am_M00t> it's not a real concept to begin with
[12:03:17] <p0indexter> its another of those paradoxes
[12:03:24] <inhahe_> i see this as anti free speech: [03:29] <I_Am_M00t> there is a certain responsibility to moderate content on all sites
[12:03:32] <I_Am_M00t> free speech is not real
[12:03:47] <inhahe_> it means something real to me

[12:04:03] <I_Am_M00t> unless you have a cohesive definition i'll just yawn
[12:04:29] <inhahe_> well the definition of free speech is lack of a restriction on speech. you need to show how it's paradoxica.l
[12:04:41] <I_Am_M00t> that's not a clear definition

[12:06:15] <inhahe_> you should prove the fantasy of existence
[12:06:38] <causative_> censorship is when something you are trying to say is prevented from being said by an entity, public or private, because of the content of what you said

[12:07:39] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t; you're the one with the rather odd view
[12:07:42] <I_Am_M00t> nope
[12:07:50] <causative_> that is, censorship is when person A wants to say X to person B, and normally could do so, but person C (the censor) prevents this from happening because of the content of X
[12:08:05] <I_Am_M00t> ain't no such thing as free speech, and it never has existed
[12:08:05] <causative_> censorship is thus different from person B refusing to hear X
[12:08:15] <I_Am_M00t> it has no clear definition either
[12:08:22] <causative_> I just told you one
[12:08:24] <inhahe_> causative_ just gave one
[12:10:51] <causative_> there is a tendency, which by introspection we ought to recognize, to categorize all political terms as either "good" or "bad," and try to define them in ways such that a "good" term can never be applied to something "bad" or vice versa
[12:10:52] <I_Am_M00t> nope
[12:11:03] <I_Am_M00t> free speech is a false concept, it doesn't even need to be addressed
[12:11:27] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t; it needs to be addressed because you have no hope of convincing anyone just by statingh it
[12:11:35] <inhahe_> so why state it
[12:11:42] <I_Am_M00t> i don't need to convince you though
[12:11:43] <causative_> for example, "free speech" is a "good" term, and so people have a tendency to say that anything that is "bad" resulting from people freely speaking, means the speech must not have been "free speech"
[12:11:51] <causative_> we see the same thing with "freedom" (another "good" term)
[12:11:54] <I_Am_M00t> i know it's false for myself, and you can continue believing in it
[12:11:59] <causative_> this tendency is harmful
[12:12:15] <causative_> it's less biased to define words by their plain meanings
[12:12:20] <inhahe_> I_Am_M00t: i find it curious that you have no desire to substatiate your claim
[12:12:25] <p0indexter> the real reason there is no free speech is because there is no free will
[12:12:26] <inhahe_> maybe you have no ability
[12:12:29] <causative_> free speech means speaking without hindrance - whether the consequences are good or bad
[12:12:42] <I_Am_M00t> inhahe_  ;)  buckeroo
[12:12:55] <I_Am_M00t> free speech is false, maybe that hurts some idealists

[12:13:14] <I_Am_M00t> no there isn't inhahe_
[12:13:16] <causative_> censorship is not exclusively something a government does
[12:13:18] <I_Am_M00t> another false concept

[12:17:14] <krb_> "free speech" does turn into brainwashing as well
[12:18:09] <inhahe_> free speech causes problems. lack of free speech causes problems.
[12:18:24] <causative_> censorship is bad when the truth is being censored
[12:18:37] <krb_> here in norway there was this guy who shot children, and the tv news have been advertising him since he did it
[12:18:57] <inhahe_> causative_: the problem is everyone, including those doing the censoring, has their own idea of what's true
[12:19:15] <causative_> yes, however, their own idea of what's true isn't the same as what's true
[12:19:16] <krb_> yeah, people are the problem
[12:19:43] <krb_> it's not like people care to bother speaking against brainwashing
[12:19:50] <krb_> or inform people well
[12:19:52] <inhahe_> causative_: yaeh, i'm just saying censorship is bad for that reason. you can't say 'we should have censorship but only censorships of nontruths'
[12:19:56] <krb_> they expect school and tv to show it for them
[12:20:00] <inhahe_> causative_ : because there's no way to do that
[12:20:11] <p0indexter> how did we get here being the problem....again a paradox
[12:20:24] <causative_> inhahe_, we do accept certain censorship of nontruths, e.g. libel laws
[12:20:28] <krb_> modern media is terrible
[12:20:33] <krb_> theres so much fake news
[12:20:37] <p0indexter> error in the code
[12:21:09] <causative_> if someone lies and says a public figure is a felon and a fraudster, when they are not, then that falls under libel laws
[12:21:20] <krb_> and people make groups surrounding various lies, and they do it in a way where they maintain the delusion, like mythology have done for thousands of years
[12:21:50] <krb_> that's defamation
[12:22:05] <causative_> one problem with censorship is when the censors choose to censor viewpoints that make them look bad.  This is bad because the censor cannot be trusted to be an unbiased judge of truth when it comes to whether the thing that makes them look bad is true.
[12:22:08] <p0indexter> justic is not always vindicated as we saw in the rittenhouse case
[12:22:37] <causative_> China does this all the time, politicians in China preventing criticism of politicians in China, and that's bad
[12:22:42] <krb_> but governments have been trying very hard to make people criminals for thousands of years as well
[12:23:06] <p0indexter> just because someone is defamed doesnt mean they will be made whole by suing
[12:23:33] <krb_> making millions of tiny laws that no one is able to know fully unless they are gifted
[12:24:09] <p0indexter> we could use less laws
[12:24:29] <inhahe_> there are so many laws because there are so many ways to be evil
[12:24:36] <causative_> ultimately what's best for society is for society to have systems that effectively find the truth.  The government can't be trusted about this, because of its opportunity for bias.  One attempt to find truth would be to let people say what they want, and rely on each individual to decide for himself. This works to the extent that the individuals are rational.
[12:25:29] <causative_> science, pollsters, or prediction markets are some other systems for finding truth
[12:25:39] <inhahe_> causative_: a lot of individuals aren't rational. see what krb said:[03:51] <krb_> and people make groups surrounding various lies, and they do it in a way where they maintain the delusion, like mythology have done for thousands of years they just form bubbles/echo chambers of delusion.
[12:25:53] <causative_> yes, that is a problem
[12:25:54] <p0indexter> we need fair laws but fewer...i do want regs to insure clean water food and medical
[12:25:55] <krb_> i like the citation: one idiot is one idiot, two idiots is two idiots. a group of idiots is a government
[12:26:04] <causative_> and so we have to weigh the relative sizes of problems
[12:26:29] <inhahe_> p0indexter: what's an example of a law we should get rid of?
[12:27:07] <causative_> if everybody in society except for a few are insane, then it could make sense for the few to manage what the insane see and hear so they don't act in an insane way.  However, who can we trust to be "the few"?  That is the problem.
[12:27:30] <I_Am_M00t> lol krb_
[12:27:32] <causative_> it comes down to whether people are - or have to be treated like - animals to be herded, or people to be reasoned with
[12:27:36] <I_Am_M00t> how about a society?
[12:27:52] <causative_> and I do see elements of both
[12:28:09] <krb_> freedom of religion should be a law that could be removed
[12:28:38] <krb_> because when people gather around fake news, there should be laws in place where one would be allowed to inform the individual/s about their delusions freely
[12:28:56] <I_Am_M00t> isn't the point of freedom of religion, to sort of remove laws that ban religion?
[12:29:10] <I_Am_M00t> if you remove it, then other laws in the opposite direction pop up?
[12:29:13] <inhahe_> yeah, freedom of religion is the absence of a law
[12:29:23] <p0indexter> inhahe_: there are so many we can start with legalizing marijuana natinally but we want it to be safe right but you have to accept my claim that there ARE more that we need to remove than more we need to add
[12:29:34] <causative_> I think I'd be in favor of a "fair time" doctrine for major media outlets, including social media, on political subjects - don't censor anyone but make sure people are presented both sides whether they want to read them or not

[12:34:03] <causative_> I'd support *conduct* moderation, not *content* moderation - you may say whatever you want, no matter how offensive, but once you do, you have to defend your views with reason, not insults and puffery
[12:34:12] <causative_> moderation is censorship, by the way
[12:34:19] <causative_> don't forget that
[12:34:28] <I_Am_M00t> it gives people legal rights to practice beliefs that deviate from norms, and that applies to atheism as well as any religion
[12:35:04] <causative_> if we could get a large portion of the population to accept elenchus as the major way to resolve ideological disputes - as opposed to memes and shouting - then perhaps that would be a better way to find truths, than the current system
[12:35:26] <inhahe_>  what is elenchus
[12:35:33] <I_Am_M00t> 🤦‍♂️
[12:35:55] <inhahe_> whatever it is i bet i disagree with it ;p
[12:36:00] <p0indexter> causative_: agree
[12:36:17] <p0indexter> and if we dont self moderate things break
[12:36:24] <causative_> elenchus is a process of cooperative questioning - two people discuss a subject, and each tries to learn what the other believes, and tries to find a contradiction if they can, and is willing to answer questions of the other person so they can better understand
[12:36:46] <inhahe_> ok
[12:36:49] <inhahe_> sounds ok
[12:37:08] <inhahe_> but i doubt it will lead to resolution of ideological disputes in most case
[12:37:10] <inhahe_> cases
[12:37:13] <p0indexter> are we as a society handling the responsibility of guns?....NO
[12:37:24] <causative_> two basic rules of elenchus:  1. don't get mad - use neutral language, even if you are mad don't let it spill out.  2. answer questions aimed at finding out what you believe and why you believe it.
[12:37:30] <p0indexter> but we all know what we need to do
[12:37:53] <causative_> if everyone could follow those two basic rules, we could reach higher levels of mutual understanding
[12:38:05] <p0indexter> ironicly in russia they handle it
[12:38:07] <inhahe_> that's tue
[12:38:08] <inhahe_> true

[12:39:20] <p0indexter> many threads sry if im not coherent
[12:41:02] <p0indexter> ppl need to be consistant in thinking regarding fake news
[12:42:08] <inhahe_> p0indexter: people don't need to be consistent in thinking. we're so often wrong that contradictions more likely enable truth than falsities, because forcing everything to cohere with a false premise only creates further falsities.
[12:42:41] <p0indexter> a percentage of ppl that are antivaxxers have recieved vaccines prior in the form of polio, measlse etc
[12:43:29] <I_Am_M00t> It . Was . Never . About . The . Truth
[12:43:34] <I_Am_M00t> Repeat with me
[12:44:22] <p0indexter> also some antivaxxers violate their own concern by having tattoos obliterating their concern for what is being injected
[12:44:37] <I_Am_M00t> > It . Was . Never . About . The . Truth
[12:44:49] <inhahe_> p0indexter: so by being self-contradictory they were allowed to be right once
[12:44:53] <inhahe_> instead of wrong twice
[12:45:05] <I_Am_M00t> nope
[12:45:07] <I_Am_M00t> that's not it
[12:45:13] <inhahe_> how is that not true
[12:45:20] <I_Am_M00t> that's not what motivates the movement
[12:45:26] <inhahe_> huh?
[12:46:18] <p0indexter> who knows whats in that vial...could be unregulated ink for alk we know
[12:46:46] <inhahe_> p0indexter: maybe getting the tattoo was the wrong move and not getting the vaccine was the right move
[12:47:00] <p0indexter> aand all it takes is one prick...not just an arm covered
[12:47:07] <I_Am_M00t> similarly, i read about an anti-abortionist who told had an abortion, and told the doctor they would go to hell for performing the abortion
[12:47:19] <I_Am_M00t> who had*
[12:48:07] <inhahe_> seems odd to choose hell over anything else
[12:48:13] <Crux> So, I'm reading Weber's "Paradoxes and Inconsistent Mathematics".
[12:48:40] <inhahe_> but of course she didn't really fully believe it
[12:48:51] <I_Am_M00t> she meant that the doctor would go to hell
[12:48:52] <I_Am_M00t> not her
[12:48:54] <inhahe_> ho k
[12:49:04] <inhahe_> weird that she wouldn't
[12:49:30] <p0indexter> deny the medical purpose and fulfill the vanity purpose
[12:49:42] <I_Am_M00t> that's because it's about identity, not about truth
[12:49:58] <p0indexter> regarding tats
[12:52:12] <p0indexter> Crux: what did you find?
[12:52:44] <Crux> I'm on through the introduction.
[12:54:05] <p0indexter> ive been facinated by a study of random generated primes that show a pattern...a paradox
[12:54:36] <Crux> This is more along the lines of the liar sentence ("This sentence is false.") and things like that.
[12:54:45] <Crux> At least so far.
[12:54:54] <Crux> That's the paradox he highlighted in the introduction.
[12:55:24] *** Quits: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn) (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:55:34] <p0indexter> i have a paradoxical joke/riddle
[12:56:31] <Crux> ok
[12:56:31] <p0indexter> did you hear the one about the masocist cowering in the corner saying beat me beat me and the sadist standing over saying NO
[12:57:13] <p0indexter> dirty paradox
[12:57:23] <p0indexter> naughty even
[12:58:51] <p0indexter> so even randomly generated primes can creaet a pattern eventho they were randomly generated
[12:59:38] <inhahe_> that implies that there's a pattern to all primes
[12:59:51] <inhahe_> probably
[13:01:19] <p0indexter> yes...it wasnt til it was created at this scale that the pattern was visible....these are large primes
[13:03:18] <inhahe_> what's the pattern?
[13:03:19] <p0indexter> aand iterations over a trillion checked
[13:04:47] <p0indexter> im summerize but encourage looking it up... booleen as "random generated primes pattern"
[13:05:46] <p0indexter> 2016 was some reporting at that time
[13:08:48] <p0indexter> the pattern is not a shock but the phenomenon of the pattern imposing itself in place of an effort to be randomly generated
[13:09:02] <inhahe_> hmm
[13:10:53] <causative_> <inhahe_> p0indexter: people don't need to be consistent in thinking. we're so often wrong that contradictions more likely enable truth than falsities, because forcing everything to cohere with a false premise only creates further falsities.
[13:11:29] <causative_> finding the contradiction is only the first step, the next step, perhaps more challenging, is to decide which of your beliefs was the wrong one that you have to fix to remove the contradiction
[13:11:41] <causative_> if you resolve the contradiction the wrong way, of course that's bad
[13:11:47] <causative_> but a contradiction is always a sign that something must be fixed
[13:12:59] <Crux> Weber talks about how real paradoxes, not mere contradictions, display revenge; they come back when you try to resolve them.
[13:13:11] <causative_> generally once a contradiction is found you try to find the least certain belief you hold that could resolve the contradiction if you changed it
[13:13:40] <causative_> but you should really reduce your confidence in *all* the beliefs that were involved in the contradiction
[13:13:44] <p0indexter> Crux: interesting
[13:13:56] <causative_> but reduce confidence in the least certain ones a lot more
[13:14:53] <inhahe_> causative_: i just feel that it's more often than not not the least certain belief that's wrong
[13:15:13] <inhahe_> so people are unlikely to come to the right conclusion
[13:15:25] <inhahe_> they simply don't know how to see how their thinking is wrong
[13:15:35] <causative_> well, if some other belief was wrong instead, then there should be more contradictions for you to find, stemming from that other wrong belief that you still hold
[13:15:45] <causative_> so you just have to find those additional contradictions and then try to fix things again
[13:15:47] <p0indexter> thats why i love the uncerainty principle... how to be unsure
[13:15:52] <causative_> it's like hunting down bugs in a computer program
[13:16:04] <causative_> first you have to find a specific, repeatable, undesired result
[13:16:14] <causative_> then you try to work out what could be responsible
[13:16:20] *** Joins: yabbes (uid254190@user/yabbes)
[13:16:38] <causative_> then you change it and see if your change not only fixes the undesired result, but doesn't create any new undesired results
[13:16:57] <causative_> "undesired result" = contradiction
[13:17:54] <inhahe_> most people's wrong paradigm includes a lot of tools for dismissing things that might contradict it
[13:18:12] <inhahe_> that should contradict it
[13:18:44] <causative_> if the paradigm is wrong then it must eventually lead to some wrong conclusions about practical matters
[13:18:48] <causative_> and those will be obvious
[13:19:22] <inhahe_> eh i disagree with that
[13:19:39] <causative_> so you can rationalize... but only up until the point where your paradigm says you should see two birds but in fact there's plainly only one
[13:19:53] <causative_> then you have to troubleshoot the paradigm
[13:20:14] <inhahe_> a lot of truth isn't practical in an undeniable way
[13:20:57] <inhahe_> a lot of falsities aren't impractical in an undeniable way
[13:23:05] <causative_> well, C S Peirce would say that what makes no practical difference makes no difference
[13:23:45] <causative_> what does it matter if your paradigm is supposedly "wrong," if there are zero definite, practical consequences of that?
[13:24:04] <inhahe_> it can be a practical consequence without being a definite one
[13:25:17] <inhahe_> there are different levels of practical
[13:26:16] <inhahe_> maybe practical is too limiting a word, i mean something like experiential consequence
[13:26:49] <causative_> it must eventually come down to some definite experience
[13:26:53] <causative_> or it's meaningless
[13:28:14] <inhahe_> it might not be clear how the belief system created a suboptimal experience
[13:29:52] <inhahe_> (to them)
[13:29:55] <causative_> unexpected rather than suboptimal
[13:30:16] <causative_> if the belief system predicts a dollar and you get a million dollars, that's not suboptimal, but it's not what was predicted, so your belief system has an issue
[13:30:48] <causative_> clarity may not be immediately apparent, yes
[13:31:02] <causative_> you have to dig
[13:31:33] <causative_> like hunting down bugs in a computer program, everything might seem fine at first
[13:32:25] <inhahe_> well, generally a false belief system creates a suboptimal experience, so it matters, but it doesn't necessarily create unexpected experiences, so you wouldn't necessarily know it's wrong
[13:33:09] <inhahe_> or it might create unexpected experiences but they're dismissed via tools
[13:34:07] <inhahe_> they're not necessarily extremely practical matters, just experiences

[21:19:35] <biys> Delf: i don't think they're a threat because they have different values, affiliations or believes
[21:20:17] <biys> it's likely a matter of familiarity associated with some kind of residual experience
[21:20:54] <biys> it's like this.  if a child is bitten by a dog at a young age, and the situation is fairly traumatic, the child could develop some kind of associations with dogs
[21:21:01] <biys> now, i grew up with dogs, i've even been bitten
[21:21:06] <biys> that doesn't mean i'm "scared" of dogs
[21:21:14] <biys> it's just altered my perspective of the potential
[21:21:53] <biys> to say that the fear of those not inside your in-group is invalid/un-necessary... i think you have a lot of biological waters to wade.  it's likely an inherent function as a result of evolution to some extent
[21:23:02] <biys> but i wouldn't say it has anything to do with their beliefs, associations, or values
[21:23:29] <Delf> Good thing that's not what I'm saying
[21:24:05] <Delf> It's vital for us to recognize danger and to avoid it
[21:24:29] <biys> idk if it's so much as recognizing danger
[21:24:33] <biys> could be the potential for danger as well
[21:24:44] <biys> or "outside of the norm"
[21:24:49] <biys> "not status quo"
[21:25:18] <biys> the way you're placing the words together makes me feel like you're missing portions of the ideas as they're held in peoples heads
[21:25:44] <biys> i have an in-group preference.  i like peopel that act the same as me, dress the same, have the same interests, look like me.
[21:26:17] <biys> i'm not a big fan of people who have different interests than i do
[21:26:20] <biys> there's no commonalities
[21:27:15] <Delf> I value different povs, they can add to the accuracy of understanding a thing or another
[21:27:50] <biys> i agree
[21:28:34] <Delf> What would be the ideas I'm missing?
[21:29:14] <biys> it just reads like there's negative intonation associated with the idea of a justifiable in-group preference.  or what could be considered "Racism"
[21:31:07] <Delf> I fail to understand
[21:31:15] <biys> the words you use
[21:33:50] <Delf> I am constantly about determining and weighing what someone's value is so I'm not exempt of the behavior of making groups of people
[21:35:21] <biys> i read something interesting on FOX the other day

[21:44:49] <Delf> Their behavior with their opinions?
[21:45:07] <Bakunin> the charitable explanation is: he has irrational fears of systems, and anything he gets told about systems potentially being harmful, he believes
[21:45:31] <Bakunin> he comes to my house and in mixed company spreads disinfo
[21:45:39] <Delf> What is the uncharitable explanation? :D
[21:45:50] <Bakunin> i challenge him, he drops the subject, then a day or two later informs me that this has caused a problem in our friendship
[21:46:18] <Bakunin> other people in the room report "nah you didnt hurt my feelings"
[21:47:23] <Bakunin> same guy will tell you Pandemic times have been the best times in his life... he quit a shit job, took up paddleboarding, got back into dating... basically he's doing great, but will wheel out the anger and vitriol over "that evil doctor fauci who wants to stick his vaxxx in everyone"
[21:48:01] <Bakunin> I point this out, and try to pin him down... he just goes in circles, Big Pharma is bad, they just want to get you addicted to vaccines, RFK is a beautiful soul, etc etc

[21:52:00] <Ungwelian> All Americans.
[21:52:19] <Ungwelian> I think it's because the healthcare system in the US is inhumane.
[21:52:41] <Ungwelian> People can't get care, so in desperation, they turn to alternatives.
[21:52:54] <Ungwelian> And that's a market too.

[21:54:03] <Ungwelian> Don't they have to pay?
[21:54:58] <Bakunin> yes, everyone does
[21:55:07] <Ungwelian> I've seen so many posts of people saying stuff like "take vitamin D for Covid".
[21:55:19] <Bakunin> it's even stranger with other demographics
[21:55:24] <Bakunin> like 20-somethings
[21:55:38] <Bakunin> only about half of them are vaccinated.  They don't see it as a threat, at all
[21:55:52] <Ungwelian> Yeah. And few 20-somethings have a lot of money.
[21:56:03] <Bakunin> well the vaccine is free, so that's no impediment
[21:56:27] <Ungwelian> That's true. But the seeds of turning to alternatives have already been sown.
[21:56:55] <Ungwelian> It's easy to think that "I can't afford this, so I don't even need it".

[22:22:09] <Bakunin> when stupidity is weaponized, like it is with antivaxers, it becomes a threat to civil society
[22:22:31] <Bakunin> It is good and right for society to shame them and gloat at their demise, because they're never going to change.
