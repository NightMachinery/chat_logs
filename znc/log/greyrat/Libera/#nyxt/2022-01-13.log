[15:33:14] <ardon> Hey aartaka, I've been playing around with nyxt/theme, it's awesome! Is there a way to dynamically change the theme? So for example while I see the changes on reload for internal buffer or on next prompt-buffer invocation, some elements like the status buffer won't reflect the changes. I tried looking around on source/browser.lisp but couldn't find anything specific to this.
[15:38:17] <aartaka> ardon: Theme is slinjected at class initialization time, so once status buffer is created, there's no easy way to change the theme. You can try setting the `style` slot to the `theme:themed-css` with new values, though.

[20:23:17] <mariari> this is a bit of a dumb quesiton, but is there way to mark a defparameter as not special?
[20:23:31] <jmercouris> mariari: no
[20:23:36] <mariari> that is quite sad
[20:23:36] <jmercouris> Not that I know of
[20:23:49] <mariari> for a DSL i want to give it'd be nice to have lexical variables at the top level without *'s around them
[20:23:53] <jmercouris> If I understood your question
[20:24:06] <jmercouris> Oh you can defparameter without stars
[20:24:12] <mariari> well I want a lexical variable
[20:24:13] <jmercouris> Thatâ€™s just a convention
[20:24:18] <mariari> yeah... but it saves you if you do it
[20:24:36] <jmercouris> I thought you meant something else
[20:24:46] <jmercouris> What you want is possible
[20:25:46] <mariari> I guess I'll lay off the macros for this, and just define function application as not really function application in CL
[20:26:00] <mariari> trying to get something very quick and dirty up
[20:26:06] <mariari> CL is great for giving DSL's fast
[20:26:25] <mariari> just the dynamic variable bit causes some strategies to not be taken, as I don't want to pollute my namesapce that badly

[21:21:27] <jmercouris> Then make a new package
[21:21:33] <jmercouris> And you wonâ€™t have to worry about it
[22:20:16] <lagash> aartaka: no Gemini support just yet, though?
[22:23:48] <aartaka> lagash: No Gemini support yet, I'm still looking for a reasonable Gemini client library :)
[22:24:25] <waleee> https://git.carcosa.net/jmcbray/cl-gemini-client
[22:24:49] <waleee> the same guy had a gemini-server written in cl
[22:25:06] <waleee> so I assumed he'd have a client too
[22:25:46] <aartaka> waleee: Wow, that was fast :D
[22:26:07] <aartaka> But wait... AGPL?
[22:26:36] <waleee> ah. That was the one you couldn't use?
[22:26:54] <jmercouris> aartaka: do you remember how to set the default attribute display?
[22:27:18] <jmercouris> aartaka: I have a object-attributes method that computes like 128 attributes, but I want the default prompter display to only show like ~8 to avoid overwhelming the user
[22:27:26] <jmercouris> I just can't for the life of me remember how that is done
[22:27:43] <aartaka> jmercouris: Give me a sec.
[22:28:49] <aartaka> jmercouris: prompter:active-attributes-keys?
[22:29:12] <jmercouris> I'll check that out
[22:29:23] <jmercouris> I know that for example in set-url the bookmarks source has some hidden attributes
[22:29:31] <jmercouris> YES IT IS ACTIVE ATTRIBUTES KEYS
[22:29:33] <jmercouris> thanks Artyom
[22:29:41] <aartaka> Yay!
[22:30:04] <jmercouris> in case you are wondering
[22:30:10] <jmercouris> the 128 attributes are for each process in charon
[22:30:43] <aartaka> jmercouris: Every process as a column?
[22:30:54] <aartaka> Or is it different pieces of data?
[22:30:58] <jmercouris> different pieces of data
[22:31:05] <aartaka> 0_o
[22:31:06] <jmercouris> there are 128 pieces of data that you can use to sort EACH process
[22:31:19] <jmercouris> I think this will be the best task manager ever
[22:31:30] <jmercouris> no wait, sorry I think it is 121 attributes
[22:31:43] <aartaka> I knew *nixes have an extensive API, but that's much more that I expected xD
[22:31:58] <jmercouris> OK i just did a (length ) it is 124
[22:32:12] <jmercouris> and now you don't have to keep it all memorized!
[22:32:19] <jmercouris> because it is all documented in charon!
[22:32:27] <jmercouris> unlike TOP, where you have no idea what is going on
[22:32:30] <jmercouris> unless you look at the man page
[22:32:37] <jmercouris> or HTOP for that matter
[22:32:41] <jmercouris> though that one at least uses nice colors
[22:32:47] <aartaka> jmercouris: while you're here, who should I talk to about Poseidon? I want to join the effort to procrastinate when I'm tired of WebExtensions :D
[22:32:54] <jmercouris> lmao

[22:33:47] <jmercouris> or whatever it is called
[22:35:21] <waleee> aartaka: honestly I think just switching to a different tty than the one running a wm/de would scare most people from touching it

[22:45:17] <jmercouris> of course
[22:47:37] <waleee> the other person with a cl gemini-client had a weird website and no link to the repo. Also it looked suspicously gui-like
[22:47:52] <lagash> What's wrong with AGPL? :(
[22:49:37] <waleee> found his repo https://notabug.org/cage/tinmop/ , looks like he went with ordinary GPL
[22:50:07] <waleee> but haven't checked if the gemini client code is abstracted away from the gui
[22:51:26] <aartaka> waleee: I found https://github.com/omar-polo/phos and I think Gemini support is going to happen real soon! :D
[22:53:47] <waleee> looked a bit cleaner than the client in https://notabug.org/cage/tinmop/src/master/src/gemini
[22:56:26] <lagash> Or, we could just roll our own (:
