[00:12:44] <johnjaye> ok. i was worried they had to add to 1
[00:15:48] <johnjaye> also i know ffmpeg has that %0d syntax or something to number outputs
[00:16:05] <johnjaye> but i found luckily the old windows cmd.exe lets you do for loops. that's pretty advanced... for windows
[00:16:24] <johnjaye> so ffmpeg -i file1.mp3 file2.mp3 output%p.mp3 works where %p is the variable

[00:17:11] <BtbN> hm, I switched from the segment muxer to the stream_segment muxer, to make a recording in a lot of 4 second HLS-compatible mpeg-ts segments. Before we had a lot of noticeable audio-glitches on segment borders
[00:17:33] <BtbN> using stream_segment over just segment mitigated that somewhat. Except now we get those glitches every 20 seconds, instead of every 4...

[02:12:08] <sybariten> JEEB: interesting, thank you
[02:12:16] <sybariten> BtbN: what is moov atom ?
[02:13:23] <sybariten> Back in the day when divx was all the rage, i used to use a tool called gspot to fix divx files that were somehow incomplete and thus unplayable...
[02:13:43] <JEEB> it's the index
[02:18:56] <sybariten> I was trying to see the logic in why the whole (mp4) file becomes unusable just because the drive is full.... (well i mean sure, a JPG would probably be hard to use if just one byte is changed, and thats also about compression).... then i realized, than when i use this screencasting tool it always takes its time to do stuff after i stop the recording. And before it says that the file is done
[02:19:39] <sybariten> this process is proportional in time to how long a recording i have done. So i guess there is a process that happens at the end of writing an mp4 file, a process that differs to the writing that happens during the actual recording?
[02:21:15] <BtbN> mp4 just has the whole index of the file at the end
[02:21:17] <BtbN> the moov atom
[02:21:20] <BtbN> without it, the file is useless
[02:21:40] <BtbN> You can move it to the front after the fact, which is probably what the tool is doing

[16:43:30] <yuri6037> Hi, I have a new problem with FFMPEG C API: libavcodec corrupts timestampts when I attempt to write frames
[16:44:00] <yuri6037> is there any reason for libavcodec to corrupts timestampts when I explicitly give it the proper timestamps?
[16:44:51] <JEEB> that sounds weird so you might want to provide code/sample where that happens
[16:45:21] <JEEB> most often something like that happens due to missing timrbase conversions etc
[16:45:38] <yuri6037> Actually I have even better problem: ffmpeg does not interleave frames anymore
[16:46:17] <yuri6037> According to ffprobe all audio frames appear at the end of the file not interleaved with video frames anymore why?

[16:49:29] *** Guest5433 is now known as pong

[17:18:41] <yuri6037> ok to be more specific pts_time is exactly 2 times less than what it is supposed to be, does anyone know what could cause this?
[17:22:32] <yuri6037> I think I found why time base is corrupted when re-encoding something forced it to 1/60k instead of 1/30k

[18:48:51] <BtbN> mp4 can't be generated live, so they must be finished files. Might as well download them.

[18:51:17] <BtbN> of course it works, but the file must be already finished for that to work
