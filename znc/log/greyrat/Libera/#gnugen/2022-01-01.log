[02:11:14] <Orbstheorem> Actually it's worse...
[02:11:24] <Orbstheorem> It's [ridiculous](https://gitlab.com/roosemberth/dotfiles/-/commit/183d6fb7aa07a52b077e5aaf2b1bdb0931de411f)...
[02:12:29] <Orbstheorem> Well, bind is ridiculous too :P... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/ae8ec126f011c69557de964b269e4c81dfc74ff9)

[02:25:26] <Orbstheorem> No doubt cloudfare was rate-limiting me...

[05:03:03] <Orbstheorem> Does anybody have an SMS service they'd be willing to share for sending messages every now and then? I want to add SMS notifications to my monitoring. (I promise to setup a latch.)
[10:10:08] <Orbstheorem> [Got something working](https://gitlab.com/roosemberth/dotfiles/-/commit/4f5a977e09e583e6253e34cf463f6a2fa39f30e4).
[16:58:34] <Orbstheorem> So, this is odd:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/b42f830b4c8ea34c9dbd447388924b0582a7a623)

[19:26:35] <Orbstheorem> Yaay, matrix messages \o/
[20:48:45] <artectrex[m]> My Nextcloud is sometimes very slow now
[20:48:55] <artectrex[m]> 20s requests..
[20:49:26] <artectrex[m]> Nothing in logs or whatever
[20:49:58] <artectrex[m]> I'll just do a new deploy I guess
[20:51:17] <jonas[m]> a slow sql query maybe?
[21:00:37] <Orbstheorem> DNS resolution issues?
[21:12:53] <artectrex[m]> <Orbstheorem> "DNS resolution issues?" <- No, nginx access logs show the long response times
[21:13:20] <Orbstheorem> I mean from your nextcloud server.
[21:13:32] <Orbstheorem> Like when accessing external resources.
[21:14:19] <Orbstheorem> In my case, I had long response times (and some 500 here or there) and it was because the database URL had to be resolved.
[21:16:32] <artectrex[m]> Interesting
