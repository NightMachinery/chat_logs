[22:38:57] <xnaas> lol
[22:39:15] <xnaas> I had an entire conversation with someone the other day like
[22:39:17] <xnaas> like that
[22:39:19] <xnaas> it was a joke
[22:39:23] <xnaas> then it just kept going

[22:56:23] <xnaas> speaking of things I think are useless in the spec
[22:56:25] <xnaas> :P
[22:56:41] * xnaas assumes Real Name is even in the spec
[22:56:44] * xnaas doesn't know, though
[22:57:06] * Baphomet didn't know what to put there and put the first shit that came to mind LOL
[22:57:30] <bookworm> yeah that's an IRC thing, same with ident
[22:57:49] <bookworm> ident is completely useless today as everyone is pretty much root
[22:58:09] <bookworm> so unless you know the host and trust it you can't actually rely on it
[22:58:43] <Baphomet> To be honest, I'm old, but not old enough to ident
[22:58:47] * xnaas had to check
[22:58:48] <bookworm> by now people started to shove pronouns and such things in the realname field, or proper names in unicode
[22:58:51] <xnaas> apparently mine's just 'xnaas'
[22:59:31] <bookworm> ~xnaas actually
[22:59:36] <bookworm> not the same

[22:59:50] <bookworm> not that it matters again but hey
[22:59:56] <xnaas> because I've definitely only typed xnaas in there
[23:00:07] <bookworm> realname != ident
[23:00:46] <Baphomet> Makes sense
[23:00:55] <xnaas> oh, didn't really read the ident messages :P
[23:01:07] <xnaas> yeah, doesn't make much sense to me either ðŸ˜…
[23:01:38] <xnaas> We don't really have shared systems any more. I know there's some out there, but definitely not common.
[23:02:05] <bookworm> that would be one thing, the problem is that ident only works if you trust the remote
[23:02:11] <Baphomet> These days I have (in much thanks to thelounge) a different nick for each browser profile
[23:02:19] <bookworm> which in todays world you very much can't
[23:02:20] <Baphomet> This way I can focus on what I'm doing
[23:02:39] <xnaas> makes sense
[23:02:55] <bookworm> I simply don't bother. Doxing me is trivial
[23:02:56] <xnaas> when the only computers talking to each other were university servers, I suppose it was much more trustable
[23:03:37] <xnaas> well
[23:03:41] <Baphomet> Also when likely there were no nickname registration
[23:03:44] <xnaas> not any more, thanks to Debian, bookworm ðŸ˜‚
[23:03:52] <bookworm> still is
[23:04:15] <bookworm> can look at my chans, look at commits, find my email and GH profile and there we go
[23:05:17] <Baphomet> My issue is that, well, as a teenager 24h per day on IRC I faced a lot of situations LOL
[23:05:37] <Baphomet> So I became this privacy paranoid I am today
[23:05:53] * bookworm never had issues
[23:06:28] * Baphomet was a toubled teenager 
[23:06:28] <bookworm> then again, I only interact in programming or linux related chans
[23:06:44] <Baphomet> Me too these days
[23:06:51] <xnaas> my teen years were spent between drugs and mental hospital
[23:06:53] <xnaas> no time for irc
[23:06:54] <xnaas> :P
[23:07:26] <bookworm> my condolences
[23:07:31] <Baphomet> xnaas: I never found out how to buy drugs, which I totally wanted
[23:07:48] <Baphomet> And had I been diagnosed in that time, I think they would put me in a mental hospital too
[23:07:51] <xnaas> For me it was easy. My parents forced me into sports and it was all downhill from there. ;P
[23:08:05] <xnaas> (caused me to meet more people, met druggies, etc.)
[23:08:34] <xnaas> but it's fine
[23:08:47] <xnaas> as for doxxing, somehow I've never pissed off anyone enough I guess?
[23:08:47] <Baphomet> Ohhh, thanks to my single mom who was more into forcing me to study I always sucked at sports 
[23:08:54] <xnaas> Also not hard to find out real info about me either.
[23:09:24] <Baphomet> Well, these days about everyone 
[23:09:53] <bookworm> interestingly enough we don't share many channels xnaas
[23:10:06] <xnaas> I'm only in 4 channels on Libera.
[23:10:11] <bookworm> usually it's the same people everywhere
[23:10:16] <Baphomet> But I rather prefer that they know about how drunk I got in a random weekend than my client version LOL
[23:10:23] <xnaas> I used to be in a shitload of channels
[23:10:25] <Baphomet> Let me see you
[23:10:28] <xnaas> but one day realized I just don't care
[23:10:54] <xnaas> I moved my Discord group to IRC a couple of years ago and we have our own server and that's good enough for me, for the most part :P
[23:11:20] <Baphomet> With xnaas I only share the two thelounge channels
[23:11:21] <xnaas> I don't even stay connected to OFTC 24/7 any more, but I do hop into #debian on there every now and then
[23:12:21] <Baphomet> bookworm: with you I share a lot more chans
[23:12:59] <xnaas> <xnaas> but one day realized I just don't care
[23:13:00] <xnaas> Additionally, I guess, I think you can read so many fat nerds say the same stupid shit so many times before you just can't anymore. :P
[23:13:17] <bookworm> fair
[23:13:39] <Baphomet> Totally fair
[23:14:15] <xnaas> but it's fine; if people are happy, be in 1000 channels :P
[23:14:31] <bookworm> not quite
[23:14:46] <xnaas> https://xnaas.info/tmp/3gU.webp â€” 3 disconnected networks sittin' there all the time ðŸ˜¬
[23:14:52] <xnaas> I suppose I could remove Twitch at this point.
[23:14:55] <Baphomet> I am in a lot of channel in my overall profiles, but I think I might receive some CTCPs cause people might think I'm a bot LOL
[23:15:05] <Baphomet> Because I don't look at them a lot
[23:15:23] <bookworm> 60ish real channels
[23:15:26] <Baphomet> Just like my whatsapp, twitter or instagram
[23:15:28] <xnaas> Idle Relay Chat â€“ it's all just idle connections with no humans on the other end
[23:15:29] <bookworm> on libera
[23:16:00] <xnaas> I was actually very, very surprised to see Libera end up even close to Freenode in connection counts.
[23:16:15] <xnaas> I kinda just assumed Freenode had like maybe a few hundred actually active connections, tops lol
[23:16:31] <bookworm> yeah well, lots of lurkers and bots as well
[23:16:41] <Baphomet> Last time I've been there 99% were bots
[23:16:45] <bookworm> some people just like to collect logs "just in case"
[23:17:10] <Baphomet> Even I became one LOL, since they provide no means of signing out from theyr BNC
[23:17:19] <Baphomet> *their
[23:17:58] <bookworm> you mean leenode? After the big drama?
[23:18:04] <bookworm> I don't connect there
[23:18:12] <xnaas> Yeah, I left pretty early on in the drama lol
[23:18:18] <Baphomet> Yes, that one, I joined by mistake
[23:18:21] <bookworm> I'm happy here and grudgingly on OFTC
[23:18:25] <xnaas> Realized very, very quickly that Lee had lost all his marbles
[23:18:37] <Baphomet> I've been away from IRC for months and was totally unaware
[23:18:48] <Baphomet> I did find strange when I saw the MOTD
[23:19:06] <Baphomet> And when I noticed no one was talking in the channels 
[23:20:25] <xnaas> The two things that disappointed me the most about Lee killing Freenode was: 1a) A lot of people left IRC forever 1b) a lot of stuff moved to Matrix... ðŸ¤® and 2) just sad Libera didn't take the time to force secure connections over TLS :P
[23:20:46] * Baphomet HATES Matrix 
[23:21:09] <xnaas> It's like "let's take all the worse parts of everything and smash it together and hope for the best"
[23:21:31] <Baphomet> I tried it but I just can't
[23:21:40] <Baphomet> I couldn't even understand that
[23:21:58] <xnaas> I host an instance of https://github.com/ajbura/cinny/ for the nightmare situation I need to join a matrix channel to ask a FOSS project something
[23:22:01] <bookworm> they shove way too many features into it, rather than stabilizing the client
[23:22:05] <xnaas> and I hate, hate, hate it so much
[23:22:22] <bookworm> well, server. Not client
[23:22:55] <xnaas> The only client that seems to even support a majority of features is Riot/Element and it's fuckin' hideous.
[23:22:58] <Baphomet> xnaas: I had once to go to a mozilla channel
[23:23:24] <Baphomet> Ohhh yeah, the clients are always crashing
[23:23:25] <xnaas> god, I was so disappointed when I saw Mozilla had moved from IRC
[23:23:32] <xnaas> not at all surprised, however
[23:24:05] <bookworm> I'm wondering how this years fossdem goes... last year matrix could not handle it very well
[23:24:21] <xnaas> now you know what would be lit?
[23:24:31] <bookworm> although in the state of the onion address they blamed the setup rather than the protocol
[23:24:39] <xnaas> A client I could be connected to IRC and Mumble at the same time (or just IRC when I don't want voice chat) ðŸ˜Ž
[23:24:44] <bookworm> meaning in theory they should have learned something
[23:24:44] <Baphomet> I wish I had the amount of disk space necessary to fetch their repository to fix a bug that has been marked as wontfix for like 8 consecutive versions
[23:25:01] <Baphomet> But firefox is huge
[23:25:19] <xnaas> I tried to submit a patch to nginx once or twice
[23:25:22] <Baphomet> I think it's the largest codebase (in gigabytes) I ever seen
[23:25:26] <xnaas> I learned that I hate hg
[23:25:32] <xnaas> :P
[23:25:48] <xnaas> submitted a patch via email once to a project on sr.ht as well â€“ also learned I hate that
[23:25:56] <bookworm> I don't get it why people use anything but git
[23:25:58] <Baphomet> I didn't have the time to check at it, when I read the 20Gb part I gave up
[23:26:07] <Baphomet> bookworm: neither do I
[23:27:25] <xnaas> how big is the linux git repo(s)?
[23:27:31] <xnaas> only thing I could imagine being larger
[23:27:50] <xnaas> also: how large is base chromium in comparison?
[23:28:02] <Baphomet> 5Gb
[23:28:09] <xnaas> (not defending Mozilla, I hate Mozilla [but love Firefox], just curious)
[23:28:12] <Baphomet> I don't know about chromium
[23:28:44] <Baphomet> But Linux is 5Gb, I'm not sure if I measured it before or after compiling
[23:29:20] <xnaas> as of may 2021, it looks like Chromium was over 20GB as well
[23:29:34] <xnaas> if https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67575879/git-clone-chromium is to be believed :P
[23:29:51] <Baphomet> That's huge

[23:30:38] <xnaas> all the sandboxing and other shit must add a shitload of codebase
[23:30:42] <Baphomet> But also, I've heard something right now about tests being the majority of the size

[23:31:16] <Baphomet> Ohhh no, I was misinterpreting it
[23:31:43] <Baphomet> xnaas: I googled recently: largest open source code bases
[23:31:58] <Baphomet> It didn't return me open source, but there was something about 300Gb
[23:32:40] <Baphomet> Windows uses git, according to this https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-biggest-codebases-in-history-a128bb3eea73/
[23:33:26] <bookworm> I mean some companies insist on a mono repo... GH and MS for one

[23:33:47] <xnaas> in fairness, for my tiny repos, I'm pro mono-repo ;P
[23:33:58] <bookworm> nah, mono repo are bad
[23:34:02] <Baphomet> for tiny repos is one thing
[23:34:15] <xnaas> but yeah, at some point you need to be like "ok this ridiculous" and break your shit out lol
[23:34:17] <Baphomet> But when the project is that huge it's time to split up
[23:34:22] <bookworm> why would you want unrelated histories crammed together?
[23:37:09] <Baphomet> Well, judging by the size of the windows repo in that link I highly doubt it's just the OS per se
[23:37:30] <xnaas> I don't think MSFT has open-sourced Windows :P
[23:37:45] <Baphomet> They surely don't
[23:38:05] <Baphomet> I have a CD, though, of an alleged leaked part of the source code in the 2000's
[23:38:52] <Baphomet> I'm not sure why I wanted to download and record a CD of that, as I said, troubled teenager

[23:46:53] <Baphomet> I've heard of reactos a couple of days ago
[23:47:12] <Baphomet> Never used though
[23:47:19] <xnaas> I've never tried it either lol
[23:47:47] <Baphomet> https://share.bruno.today/bruno/kernel.jpg
[23:48:24] <xnaas> oh my god
[23:48:29] <xnaas> do you actually run on linux-next tho
[23:48:56] <Baphomet> No, only on VMs
[23:49:12] <bookworm> do you hack on the kernel?
[23:49:13] <xnaas> haha makes more sense
[23:49:16] <bookworm> Or just out of curiosity?
[23:50:02] <Baphomet> I used develop non-opensource kernel modules and other stuff like that by around 2009-2012
[23:50:06] <Baphomet> *used to
[23:50:20] <xnaas> aha, finally found what I was looking for using thelounge's desperately-in-need-of-improvement-from-smarter-folks-than-me search function :P
[23:50:22] <xnaas> https://media.handmade-seattle.com/essence/
[23:51:19] * bookworm hisses at Baphomet 
[23:51:40] <xnaas> shun the closed source amirite
[23:52:01] <bookworm> what do you mean re search?
[23:52:23] <xnaas> unless you kind of already know exactly the content of a line you're searching for, it's super rough
[23:52:45] <xnaas> there's no context around a search (and no jumping back, but I know that's a separate thing being worked on)
[23:52:48] <xnaas> no AND/OR
[23:52:49] <xnaas> etc.
[23:53:10] <xnaas> no searching by author
[23:53:12] <xnaas> of a line
[23:53:39] <xnaas> Obviously I can just go grep text looks and get what I want (advanced regex too)
[23:53:40] <xnaas> but like
[23:53:46] <xnaas> that's such a pain in the ass on mobile lol
[23:54:05] <Baphomet> bookworm: lol, I would hiss at the fact that I stopped because the only place I could work in my area would pay me shit for that 
[23:54:57] <xnaas> s/looks/logs
[23:55:32] <Baphomet> And of course, the non open source was my employer's choice, not mine
[23:56:00] <bookworm> yeah of course, was just poking fun at you
[23:57:00] <Baphomet> Sorry, it took me a while to realize 
[23:57:21] <xnaas> I do love being able to /search whatever and get something, but I want more. :P
[23:57:29] <Baphomet> But now reading again I can see 
[23:58:14] <Baphomet> I'm loving to talk here, I didn't know the /search command
[23:58:33] <bookworm> it's pretty bare bones as of now, as mentioned
[23:58:38] <bookworm> but better than nothing
[23:58:47] <bookworm> also horribly slow on my 5+GB DB...
[23:58:57] <Baphomet> Ouch
[23:58:58] <bookworm> WE NEED A FT INDEX!
[23:59:11] <Baphomet> You're using sqlite, right?
[23:59:14] * bookworm starts throwing postgres at the problem
[23:59:25] <Baphomet> If I'm not mistaken I saw it somewhere
[23:59:25] <bookworm> yeah, it would have a module that can do it I think
[23:59:31] <bookworm> sqlite that is
[23:59:55] <bookworm> sqlite can do a *lot*
