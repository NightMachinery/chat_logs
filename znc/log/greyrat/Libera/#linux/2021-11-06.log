[08:02:40] <Dagmar> Like he said
[08:02:50] <Dagmar> Separate display/input hardware

[08:03:30] <Sircle> Blondie101010 via multiseat
[08:03:33] <Dagmar> Unless you really, really want a hard partition of separation for RAM utilization, it'll be smoother to just have a plain multiheaded box running Ubuntu
[08:03:33] <Blondie101010> well it might

[08:04:28] *** Joins: mhs (~mhs@144.202.232.42)
[08:05:01] <Dagmar> I would _start_ with just fighting through the stuff necessary to separate those inputs and displays for X, because it's a problem you'll have to solve _anyway_
[08:05:12] <Dagmar> Then you can decide if you really need to spin up dedicated VMs, and it'll be pretty straightforward
[08:05:34] <Dagmar> There _is_ overhead involved
[08:05:56] <Dagmar> It's not major, but you lose about 1Gb of RAM to the hypervisor and host OS, adn maybe 5-15% of the CPU

[08:08:50] <Sircle> Dagmar like in xorg?
[08:09:10] <Dagmar> It's very possible, but it's almost never done anymore so digging up the info will involve a lot of man pages and/or Googling
[08:09:37] <Dagmar> Yes.  You've always been able to tell X which specific hardware device to use as a display and to not look any further
[08:09:42] <Sircle> well what if I want to have only one video card with 3 slot in it. usually a DP, hdmi, dvi
[08:09:48] <Dagmar> ...because at one point in the dark ages you had a lot of cases where you HAD to

[08:22:29] <Dagmar> Not impossible.  I hate to call it "hard" but it's definitely an annoying level of technical stuff that's normally just _not_ necessary at all
[08:22:41] <Blondie101010> I think the discussion would be different (or inexistent) if he had the skill
[08:22:54] <Dagmar> Neh I don't really know about that

[08:29:29] <loganlee> but cheese does
[08:29:31] <Sircle> Blondie101010 Dagmar   I have "done" multi seat via virtualbox. 2-3 people including 1 host os and other guest os. With only "one" builtin iGPU (no multiple video cards). Including audio for each user separately via simple usb audio device. mice, keyboard, monitor for each. I separated screens with the software based desktop/screen. controled
[08:29:31] <Sircle> inpupts via virtualbox filters. It was simple. Just a mouse pointer tweak. I also did multi seat with bare linux and multiple video cards. That was tougher. but my point is a) Blondie101010 do not think or assume. There are lots of possibilities. even comercial hardware and software. It is a vast / deep thing to know before advice. There are many
[08:29:32] <Dagmar> Can _other_ things read your webcam?

[09:40:18] <Hash> Hi
[09:40:21] <Hash> Anyone know google chrome?
[09:40:27] <Hash> Looking for a way to do sessions
[09:40:39] <Hash> Like a session for school (save all my tabs for scholwork)
[09:40:55] <Hash> session for this, or that, keep each window of chrome separated and saved
[09:41:16] <Blondie101010> https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9025411?hl=en
[09:41:40] <Blondie101010> but I use separate OS sessions to separate things cleanly
[09:42:21] <Hash> https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/session-buddy/edacconmaakjimmfgnblocblbcdcpbko?hl=en
[09:42:36] <Hash> Something like this. Which I've used for years. Session Buddy is great.
[09:42:45] <Hash> Just need a few more specific things I think
[09:43:06] <rindolf> Hash: use --user-data-dir= ?
[09:43:13] <Hash> Same usre.
[09:43:20] <Hash> I'm not trying to separate the users.
[09:43:36] <Hash> It's one user. Me. My one account. Just diff saved windows with diff tabs for diff purposes in life.

[15:18:04] <p`> well your :: listen is trying to be a catch-all

[15:18:46] <lockywolf> if there is some "mapped ipv4" that could be the case
[15:18:59] <p`> right, it's on by default on linux
[15:18:59] <Dagmar> Since it's binding a 6-to-4 address, it really _is_ effectively binding to ipv4 port 80 when it does that, which is why it breaks because that overlaps with the address-specific ipv4 port 80 bindings
[15:19:19] <p`> you could alternatively probably specifically define the v6 addresses
[15:19:31] <lockywolf> it is a dynamic address
[15:19:39] <Dagmar> If you were to simply bind the ipv6 addres to a _specific_ ipv6 address instead of :: you'd be fine
[15:19:40] <lockywolf> I can rewrite it on updates, but it is a pain

[15:53:07] <phogg> ubuntu also wins over Debian, which goes to show you how useful the results of a popularity contest are
[15:53:16] <lockywolf> ubuntu is ok
[15:53:21] <ayecee> okay now do linux vs windows
[15:53:28] <lockywolf> not terribly good, but fine

[15:54:21] <ayecee> closer than i thought it'd be
[15:54:41] <rascul> and triple pane
[15:54:55] <phogg> linux vs. macos would be a fairer fight
[15:55:15] <phogg> even then true fairness requires comparing a single distribution

[15:55:32] <wigums> linux vs tacos
[15:55:34] <phogg> ubuntu vs. macos is 107 to 129

[16:25:00] <Blondie101010> gosh
[16:25:04] <tinyweasel> yeah...
[16:25:08] <tinyweasel> but it's the build for pentium 1 systems
[16:25:13] <tinyweasel> so, it should technically run
[16:25:29] <tinyweasel> it can't handle more than 900MB of RAM for this build, and only a single CPU core shows up

[16:25:35] <Blondie101010> what is that assumption based on?

[16:26:39] <tinyweasel> would kernel v4 work?
[16:26:39] <Blondie101010> you might be able to trim it down, but it will be a tedious process with little benefit
[16:26:54] <Blondie101010> the older, the smaller it'll be
[16:26:57] <tinyweasel> yes
[16:27:00] <TJ-> tinyweasel: just configure the kernel for the physical hardware and nothing optional
[16:27:08] <Blondie101010> definitely

[16:27:23] <tinyweasel> openwrt does that

[16:28:54] <tinyweasel> yeah, there's no compression

[16:29:11] <tinyweasel> hmm
[16:29:31] <Blondie101010> also we said to trim it down to the specific hardware, which would make it only work on one system, not the two you're working with

[16:30:30] <tinyweasel> fine
[16:30:58] <Blondie101010> that will tell you the base kernel memory footprint
[16:31:09] <tinyweasel> yes, just wait 10mins for this to compile, of course
[16:31:30] <TJ-> it's not particularly important, but in these situations you need to be aware of every impact on storage or RAM usage

[18:17:31] <qwerty> i'll experiment a bit with sed maybe i'll learn a thing or two, if nothing works i'll do it with a script
[18:17:34] <qwerty> thanks
[18:17:38] <hodapp> but e.g. I am pretty sure awk will let you store a specific line to a variable, and then compare that line to some other line and do something based on that (e.g. suppress output if it's the N+50'th line and it matches stored line N)
[18:17:44] <Blondie101010> with sed it would be very hard...  I think it could be done with awk but not my expertise
[18:17:44] <hodapp> sed, I am not sure
[18:17:51] <Blondie101010> I'd do it in php or bash
[18:18:21] <Blondie101010> sed supports advanced expressions which allow back references
[18:18:38] <Blondie101010> but it'd be very complicated for such a simple task

[18:19:06] <Guest67> Hi I'm reading the kernel code and I'm confused by the usage of a field in task_struct (include/linux/sched.h). This field is pid_links which is an array of list nodes as you may already know. I don't understand why there is a PIDTYPE_PID link since this list will always be of size 1 (unless there are tasks with same pid). Do you have any idea what

[19:51:36] <xiaomiao> the trick is to learn how to find information

[20:04:04] <lionslicer> this linux bible mentions some specific distros. this doesn't mean it the focus is on some branches of linux, right? I'm new to linux trying to learn more
[20:04:15] <Tokoma> it has smaller userbase, but steady, even relative to the lower postcount on mailinglists etc there is still very little talk about license and companies etc
[20:04:17] <ayecee> f0xb4t: ah no, that's close but not it. it only sets the first value because only one value is given. keymaps changes that behavior, apparently.

I'm trying to copy stuff to a ssd, but it's smaller and so I only want to keep specific files. The bottleneck seems to be simply iterating over the files. Is there anything I can do to speed this up?
[20:08:06] <Tokoma> perhaps not, but there are quite some people in the Linux-ecosphere or community that strongly care about license and what companies do with GPL software, i call that activism. doesn't need to be bad though, just not really my cup of tea
