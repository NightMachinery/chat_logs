[02:13:58] <c355E3B> As we all know, FTP is cursed bullshit
[02:14:05] <c355E3B> Like its not up for debate, its total trash
[02:14:07] <wink> did anyone ever benchmark the speed of FTPS versus SFTP?
[02:14:22] <wink> horribleness notwithstanding
[02:14:37] <c355E3B> SFTP/SCP are also not the best, but at least SFTP admits it
[02:14:57] <wink> that wasn't the question :P
[02:15:03] <c355E3B> The fun happens when you need to munge all three protocols together
[02:15:33] <Church> Oh no
[02:15:34] <c355E3B> To do this, you run sshd with a bunch of authorized keys bullshit + pureftpd with tape to match
[02:15:53] <c355E3B> Now imagine that this works for years, and all of your ETL scripts run through it
[02:15:56] <wink> I am pretty sure I did that some years ago :P maybe proftp tho
[02:16:06] <Church> This is so cursed
[02:16:15] <c355E3B> well what happens when you need to comply with ISO 2700 whatever for your biggest customer?
[02:16:29] <c355E3B> you first, add logging
[02:16:33] <c355E3B> second, you add user accounts
[02:16:59] <c355E3B> and since you are doing this everywhere else why not tie it  into your Okta license you spent $X000 on?
[02:17:26] <c355E3B> So I magicked a pam module into exsistance to make all of the necessary calls
[02:17:45] <wink> now it gets unrealistic because Okta was only founded in 2009 ;)
[02:18:12] <c355E3B> and it broke because the customer's IBM mainframe couldn't handle the change in authentication nor could our data team
[02:18:32] <c355E3B> so the "fix"? multiple pam modules chaining themselves

[17:20:11] <riv> im not sure what it is exactly, but one type of commit seems to be a tree object - not sure if it's the entire tree or just the changes
[17:20:45] *** Quits: pnoud (~pnoud@user/pnoud) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[17:21:38] <dutchie> a commit consists of a tree, a list of parents, and some metadata like author, message and date
[17:22:07] <dutchie> that's a tree as in a pointer to a git tree object which contains all the objects (with some deduplication happening)
[17:22:24] <ngoldbaum> riv: a commit is a snapshot of the state of the repository at one time
[17:22:39] <riv> I see
[17:22:47] <ngoldbaum> to actually encode that state you need delta-chains but that’s an implementation detail
[17:22:59] <riv> oh interesting
[17:24:41] *** Quits: humky (~humky@user/humky) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[17:31:19] <wink> not sure if snapshot is the correct name, but it's not wrong
[17:31:49] <wink> it's more that a commit points to a specific point in the graph/tree and this fulfills some snapshot criteria
[17:32:10] <riv> i guess i could look at how 'checkout' works internally
[17:32:13] <wink> if it was a snapshot I'd say you couldn't cherry pick a single commit
[17:32:24] <riv> oh interesting
[17:32:29] <wink> because you only take the "data" of the commit and kinda ignore its history
[17:32:34] <wink> but keep it.
[17:32:35] <rbasak> It is a snapshot of the source tree
[17:32:37] <wink> it's complicated!
[17:32:44] <rbasak> A cherry-pick would create a new commit, with its own new snapshot
[17:32:52] <rbasak> (of a new tree)
[17:33:02] <wink> yes. but then "commit" and 'commit' are different things
[17:33:12] <wink> commit as the user does it and commit as git has it worded
[17:34:09] <rbasak> "Commit" as a user does it creates a new "commit" as the git data structure. The former is a verb. The latter is a noun. The verb "commit" means to create an instance of the noun "commit".
[17:34:38] <ngoldbaum> it doesn’t help that linus invented a bunch of terminology when he was writing git
[17:34:53] <ngoldbaum> that doesn’t agree with prior usage in other vcs systems
[17:35:08] <rbasak> Yeah that part is confusing.
[17:35:13] <wink> as I said, it;s complicated
[17:35:26] <wink> that's how whole books have been written :P
[17:35:27] <rbasak> But when you get over the terms and understand the data structure, it actually becomes remarkably simple compared to other VCS systems
[17:35:40] <wink> it may be easier to implement than use

[17:39:53] <dutchie> it's just a DAG, what's the problem

[17:41:18] <ngoldbaum> dutchie: it’s a merkle tree, git is a blockchain except the consensus resolution mechanism involves messing with conflict markers by hand

[17:42:01] <riv> hmmm could you makee a bitcoin based on git
[17:42:17] <dutchie> ngoldbaum: there is presumably some arcane category theory nonsense you could rephrase "merkle tree" into
[17:42:37] <riv> maybe a poset?
[17:42:45] <dutchie> for maximum points going for the "monoid in the category of endofunctors" analogue
