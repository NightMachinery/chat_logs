[14:04:41] <SteppenwolfVM> but it's only on spotify, right? i'll never know how it sounds
[14:05:16] <SteppenwolfVM> this reminded me of this song i made a while ago tho https://steppenwolfvonmensch.bandcamp.com/track/dont-fucking-buy-meat
[14:05:19] <Janet> ^ Don't Fucking Buy Meat | Steppenwolf von Mensch
[14:05:57] <SteppenwolfVM> i posted this song in a pedal group first, as it's mixed using guitar pedals, asking for creative input regarding the sound 
[14:06:23] <SteppenwolfVM> two days later i added the lyrics after multiple requests, man were they personally attacked and fed up 
[14:06:44] <murthy> SteppenwolfVM: I would be one
[14:06:57] <murthy> you don't share songs without lyrics
[14:07:01] <SteppenwolfVM> as if you couldn't do very well without harming animals 
[14:07:08] <SteppenwolfVM> no, they fed up after i added the lyrics
[14:07:21] <SteppenwolfVM> complaining how they were supposed to survive without buying meat 
[14:07:22] <murthy> ha ha ha
[14:07:24] <SteppenwolfVM> in america
[14:07:39] <SteppenwolfVM> and how they were supposed to afford anything else than meat etc.
[14:07:45] <SteppenwolfVM> sick world i tell ya
[14:07:49] <murthy> ya same story here
[14:08:10] <murthy> indeed
[14:10:34] <R2robot> Q: How can you tell if someone is vegetarian/vegan?
[14:10:48] <R2robot> A: Oh, don't worry.. they'll tell you every fucking chance they get.  
[14:10:50] <R2robot> :P
[14:11:27] <SteppenwolfVM> let's check that
[14:11:38] <SteppenwolfVM> R2robot: do you agree i write here frequently, every now and then?
[14:11:53] <R2robot> wut
[14:11:56] <SteppenwolfVM> R2robot: how often did i mention i'm vegan before?
[14:12:08] <SteppenwolfVM> R2robot: did i even mention i'm vegan right now?
[14:12:13] <R2robot> someone feels personally attacked?
[14:12:21] <R2robot> it goes both ways :D
[14:12:55] <SteppenwolfVM> answer now
[14:13:10] <SteppenwolfVM> come on, don't chicken out
[14:13:27] <R2robot> I made my point :)
[14:13:33] <SteppenwolfVM> which point?
[14:13:48] <SteppenwolfVM> i'm waiting for answers...
[14:14:06] <R2robot> WOOOOSH!
[14:14:19] <SteppenwolfVM> buck buck buck buck we have a chicken here
[14:14:53] <SteppenwolfVM> does this mean we get to stuff things into your butt now R2robot, before baking you in an oven?

[14:22:54] <SteppenwolfVM> choose your words wisely 
[14:22:55] <SteppenwolfVM> :D
[14:24:27] <SteppenwolfVM> hey, look at this tofu https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.media-allrecipes.com%2Fuserphotos%2F8332790.jpg
[14:24:47] <SteppenwolfVM> can you take the view without crying, R2robot?
[14:25:35] <SteppenwolfVM> i think i'll make this a thing, trolling meat eaters with the nonsense they troll vegans
[14:25:43] <SteppenwolfVM> there's plenty of inspiration to catch up with 
[14:26:31] <murthy> SteppenwolfVM: I am surprised that you only came to know about low wage stuff and poor labour conditions in various countries
[14:26:54] <SteppenwolfVM> i know about that since forever, it's no secret 
[14:27:09] <murthy> so why now getting depressed about it?
[14:27:14] <SteppenwolfVM> but now i figured i can have guitar amps with no shady parts in them
[14:27:24] <SteppenwolfVM> and then i looked at the rest of my music gear and felt bad
[14:27:41] <murthy> any well known certification
[14:27:42] <murthy> ?
[14:27:54] <SteppenwolfVM> look at any boutique amp builder
[14:28:04] <murthy> for example like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairphone
[14:28:05] <Janet> ^ Fairphone is a social enterprise company which aims to develop smartphones that are designed and produced with a lower environmental and social impact. The company is based in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and was supported in its startup...
[14:28:19] <SteppenwolfVM> fairphone is made in china, i have the fairphone 2
[14:28:34] <murthy> SteppenwolfVM: awesome
[14:28:43] <SteppenwolfVM> well it depends
[14:28:46] <murthy> I wish I could buy one
[14:28:51] <SteppenwolfVM> i'm a little fed up with it
[14:29:01] <SteppenwolfVM> it works but keeps malfunctioning in many ways
[14:29:10] <SteppenwolfVM> the fairphone 3 and now 4 is way better
[14:29:14] <SteppenwolfVM> but i can't afford another one
[14:29:19] <murthy> can't compete with the big techs yet cause they use ads to reduce cost
[14:29:37] <SteppenwolfVM> well it's pricey 
[14:29:41] <murthy> ya
[14:29:42] <SteppenwolfVM> look at the prices
[14:29:53] <SteppenwolfVM> not as pricey as a lot of iphones
[14:29:54] <SteppenwolfVM> but still
[14:29:57] <murthy> SteppenwolfVM: but you understand why they are pricey right?
[14:30:03] <SteppenwolfVM> yes
[14:30:07] <murthy> ya
[14:30:13] <SteppenwolfVM> but i'm having some doubts about their mission meanwhile, i'm not sure anymore
[14:30:23] <murthy> ya
[14:30:33] <murthy> lesser of evil is ok
[14:30:41] <SteppenwolfVM> big brands like apple are doing various things to make working conditions better for people in far east

[14:30:51] <murthy> here to in India
[14:30:52] <SteppenwolfVM> the fairphone does the same on a different level
[14:31:08] <SteppenwolfVM> i'm not sure which one is the better way right now, or if there is a good way at all
[14:31:09] *** Joins: chiselfuse (~chiselfus@user/chiselfuse)
[14:31:23] <murthy> the difference is Apple only respond after complaints
[14:31:24] *** Joins: KevlarNoir (~kevlar@2a01:e0a:5d7:e1e0:d7af:cc9a:b462:823f)
[14:31:53] <SteppenwolfVM> good point, but the fairphone company needed to take a lot of compromises too
[14:31:59] <SteppenwolfVM> however, they are improving
[14:32:23] <murthy> here like 10 ladies got food poisoning and then all the works staged a road block, later it got into news then after that only Apple responded
[14:32:24] <murthy> so
[14:32:45] <murthy> the main culprit is foxconn
[14:33:35] <murthy> local is good
[14:33:46] <SteppenwolfVM> yeah, apple isn
[14:33:51] <SteppenwolfVM> 't ideal in their morals 
[14:33:59] <SteppenwolfVM> but still better than a lot of other average brands
[14:34:01] <murthy> ya
[14:34:08] <SteppenwolfVM> samsung is much worse
[14:34:17] <murthy> ya
[14:34:21] <SteppenwolfVM> and some others are basically hell
[14:34:24] <murthy> SteppenwolfVM: whats your tube amp model
[14:34:38] <SteppenwolfVM> i'm only searching for my first "real" tube amp right now
[14:34:45] <murthy> oh nice
[14:34:50] <SteppenwolfVM> currently i use a Sabelya Minus since last december 
[14:35:01] <SteppenwolfVM> it's a 1W tube amp in pedal format
[14:35:18] <SteppenwolfVM> but it's not made with all the desirable components and all
[14:35:49] <murthy> I will ask people for it, but can you give some details, like are you looking for a personal use or like studio grade.
[14:36:07] <SteppenwolfVM> all good, tube amps aren't hard to figure about
[14:36:34] <SteppenwolfVM> there are probably about 20 or more builders in europe alone, most of them only using the best components they can get
[14:36:59] <SteppenwolfVM> outside of the big market brands, i mean
[14:37:30] <murthy> does different tube amps have different signature sounds
[14:37:44] <SteppenwolfVM> yes of course
[14:37:46] <murthy> like I know people have said Marshall have some kind of warm music songs
[14:37:50] <murthy> sound
[14:37:55] <SteppenwolfVM> most of them are very similar, but each has their own design and sound
[14:38:13] <murthy> nice
[14:39:00] * R2robot has a "boutique"-esque BlackHeart tube amp and cabinet.   They went out of business though  :(
[14:39:01] <murthy> what do you think about Focusrite?
[14:39:11] <murthy> SteppenwolfVM: ^
[14:39:24] <murthy> oops
[14:39:29] <SteppenwolfVM> nice R2robot
[14:39:48] <SteppenwolfVM> murthy: focurite is just one of many chinese made brands, nothing good or special in this regard
[14:40:24] <SteppenwolfVM> Yamaha have some programmes where they make it mandatory to improve the political/social/labour situation in context with their far east production
[14:40:29] <murthy> oh ok. I have seen many people use it for mic
[14:40:34] <SteppenwolfVM> so do some other brands, but i forgot which ones

[22:00:51] <Ultros> save the chewing
[22:01:18] <nativetexan> well, kale tastes terrible so...just throw in some apples

[22:01:34] <nativetexan> it's not too bad

[22:12:54] <nativetexan> i got the root canal repair done yesterday
[22:14:25] <nativetexan> took 3 hours to drill out the old filling and refill it
[22:15:10] <Ultros> hows it feel?
[22:15:14] <nativetexan> abused

[22:15:27] <Ultros> they sure dont go easy do they.
[22:15:59] <nativetexan> well, the dentist said the old filling was like a rock, had to switch drill bits at least a dozen times
[22:16:36] <Ultros> id be like "well leave it the fek alone fill around it!"
[22:18:25] <Panther> When he comes back in with a jackhammer, you know you are in for some trouble.

[22:20:35] <Panther> I went to the dentist yesterday too.
[22:20:45] <Ultros> prolly all up in your nostril
[22:21:38] <nativetexan> i go back next week to get fitted for the crown
[22:21:54] <Ultros> oh shit they didnt do that at the same time rh
[22:21:57] <Ultros> eh*
[22:22:02] <Ultros> you got a peg atm?
[22:22:12] <nativetexan> the dentist wanted it to 'cure' 
[22:22:45] <nativetexan> i'm chewing on the right side of mouth until then
[22:22:52] <Ultros> makes sense
[22:22:53] <Panther> I just had a chip fixed, but he numbed my whole mouth so I couldn't talk... I had to bail on rock climbing, cuz no one could understand anything I was saying.
[22:23:06] <Ultros> mine felt really soft n gross for about two weeks
[22:23:19] <Panther> Clear communication is crucial in that.
[22:23:49] <Panther> He also said not to eat until the anaesthetic wore off, or I could choke.
[22:23:57] <nativetexan> yeah, i bet communication would be crucial in rock climbing

[23:19:14] <Cale> Hello
[23:19:34] <Cale> Last night I played around with a Bohlen-Pierce scale a bit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aF61KtCVIM
[23:19:42] <Janet> ^ Some Exploration of Bohlen-Pierce Harmony - YouTube
[23:20:08] <Cale> There's no octave (which multiplies frequencies by 2), only the tritave (multiplies frequencies by 3)
[23:21:11] <nativetexan> that's your keyboard?
[23:21:24] <Cale> Yeah :)
[23:21:40] <nativetexan> enjoyed the show Panther
[23:21:45] <Cale> In this system I have a good major sixth and minor seventh, and a nice-sounding 7/5 tritone, but a lot of the usual tools for harmony are missing. It's mind-bending.
[23:22:42] <Panther> Thanks for listening nativetexan :)
[23:22:50] <Panther> And anyone else... :)
[23:22:51] <Cale> I can sort of improvise all right in it though, because a bunch of music theory is encoded into the geometry of the keyboard layout :)
[23:23:01] * Panther is rendering it now.
[23:23:28] <nativetexan> yeah, interesting
[23:26:04] <hype> Good morning.

[23:57:02] <Cale> It's quite nice, typically. In my usual layout, all the natural extensions are lined up in a nice way just above any triad
[23:57:28] <Cale> I thought there were some fancy open voiced chords in at least one of the things I posted... :)
