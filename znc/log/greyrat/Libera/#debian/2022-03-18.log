[00:40:49] <rendar> that was the question
[00:41:04] <towo-home> it tells 5.10.0
[00:41:08] <rendar> sorry, 5.10.0-12-amd64
[00:41:09] <rendar> yeah
[00:41:27] <towo-home> not again, debian kernel versiomn will stay at 5.10.0
[00:41:30] <rendar> but what is that 12?
[00:41:46] <towo-home> it's the 12th build of the 5.10 series

[00:50:02] <rendar> kee, i see
[00:50:30] <rendar> so Debian keeps adding incremental integer numbers to the main kernel version, which is 5.10.0
[00:50:39] <rendar> whenever there is a new patch level
[00:50:45] <kee> Well… It's 5.10.92 at the moment.

[00:55:51] <towo-home> and you have clearly 5.10.92 running
[00:56:51] <rendar> so if i got it right, debian adds incremental numbers to 5.10.0-NN based on what patchlevel will be used? e.g. 5.10.0-10 can be 5.10.87, 5.10.0-11 can be 5.10.89, and 5.10.0-12 is 5.10.92, i got this right?

[03:59:32] <kee> CashDash123: Is it one that Linux supports?
[03:59:45] <CashDash123> more specfically I want to create a livecd for the i486

[04:00:30] <CashDash123> *the
[04:01:17] <greycat> your best bet would be simply to use the last version of Debian (or other distro) which supports that platform
[04:01:47] <PhotoJim> CashDash123: how recent a kernel can you get to run on i486?
[04:03:00] <PhotoJim> looks like 3.2.67 was the last kernel I custom-compiled for a 486 under Debian.
[04:03:23] <kee> CashDash123: Can you port qemu?
[04:03:29] <kee> If so, no need to port all of Debian. :-)
[04:04:03] <PhotoJim> I still have my 486 (it was my first Linux machine, back when Debian ran a 2.2.20 kernel).  but I was thinking of NetBSD to resurrect it.

[04:05:08] <CashDash123> As far as I'm aware the latest kernel ( espically consdidering there are still 486's being made for embedded platforms) I image all I would have to do is recompile the sources and then I can use debootstrap to make a chroot then make a livecd

[04:05:53] <PhotoJim> no, but I imagine you can manually compile a much later kenel for 486.  pretty sure you can't compile a current 5.x kernel though.

[07:24:57] <Mr_Queue_> go for it.
[07:24:59] <sney> if you want the source code, that's "apt source" not install
[07:26:02] <Mr_Queue_> To be honest if you're asking for sourse, you likely don't need it.

[07:30:24] <Mr_Queue_> We are still at the X Y problem here.
[07:30:35] <sney> msk: also, if you want to look at the changes debian makes to a package without downloading it locally, tracker.debian.org has all that information and more

[11:25:31] <PamiPetteri> jelly, ok. why am I worried?

[11:26:51] <jelly> that's confusing cause and effect.  It is the inactive pages than get moved from memory to swap BECAUSE they're inactive and unneeded
[11:27:06] <PamiPetteri> why does not the system show eventually 0 swap? the swap seems to be in use, but I have very little knowledge about how it actually works.
[11:27:16] <PamiPetteri> jelly, ah
[11:27:34] <PamiPetteri> so they are just sitting in the swap and doing nothing
[11:28:00] <PamiPetteri> do they eventually become active or just stay in the swap until the swap is turned off and on again?
[11:28:07] *** Quits: keypusher (keypusher@user/keypusher) (Quit: bye)
[11:28:16] <PamiPetteri> I have a script I got from the WWW that clears the cache AND the swap.
[11:28:37] <jelly> if something needs a page, it will be pulled in from swap back into ram
[11:28:59] <PamiPetteri> does that happen rarely?
[11:29:13] <PamiPetteri> I am getting a clearer idea of the concept. Thanks.
[11:29:27] <jelly> if nothing ever needs it, if it's completely useless, it will stay on swap forever (until reboot or someone manipulates with swapoff)
[11:30:37] <jelly> limited use of swap is completely benign, leave it be

[11:36:51] <jelly> PamiPetteri, the script you got can be helpful in some pathological situations where kernel heuristics what to page out can get confused.  Those will inevitably coincide with active so and si.  A system with some small, relatively unchaging amount of swap used is not a problematic situation like that.

[15:46:32] <Khepra> stdInOut: for debian repos (not third party), you replace   deb.debian.org _domain_ with the cctld domain (ftp.<cctld>.debian.org), nothing else. all the paths in the domain and components must remain the same.
[15:46:59] <sussudio> you could just have run "apt update" again.
[15:47:20] <Khepra> I think security.debian.org was recommended in the past for receiving security updates fastest; I don't know if that's still a recommendation.
[15:49:08] <stdInOut> Khepra, I updated the security lines as shown on debian wiki, and the update worked finally, albeit with a notice that the new source did not have a Release file, and updates from there might not be secure. but the new source didnt solve the original problem, either.

[17:58:42] <jelly> badsektor, in theory you don't lose anything.  In practice upgrades of various components might break some software
[17:59:21] <badsektor> ok thanks a lot
[18:00:18] <jelly> the release notes document many of the known incompatiibilities and things that need to be taken care of
[18:00:26] <jelly> dpkg, buster->bullseye
[18:00:26] <dpkg> Read (at least) the upgrading chapter of <release notes> https://deb.li/39cyD . TL;DR: In /etc/apt/sources.list change "buster" to "bullseye", fix the line for security updates (see <bullseye-security>), remove stable-specific lines like buster-backports. apt update && apt upgrade --no-new-pkgs && apt full-upgrade. 3rd party repos like <dmo> cause problems with upgrades. If working over ssh, upgrade ssh first, see <bullseye ssh upgrade>.

[18:07:09] <dpkg> [Basic Apt* Troubleshooting]. To diagnose your problem, we need ALL OF THE FOLLOWING information: 1. complete output of your apt-get/apt/aptitude run (including the command used) 2. output from "apt-cache policy pkg1 pkg2..." for ALL packages mentioned ANYWHERE in the problem, and 3. "apt-cache policy".  Use https://paste.debian.net/ to provide us with this information.  Also ask me about <localized errors>.
[18:07:19] <jelly> oj, ^ please show all the info
[18:07:46] <jelly> and tell us which package is "conflicting" if it's not obvious from the outputs

[18:15:46] <jelly> oj, you should probably run "apt update" and use "apt full-upgrade" more often on unstable

[18:16:38] <oj> is that just general housekeeping advice or will that solve this issue?
[18:16:43] <jelly> !full-upgrade
[18:16:44] <dpkg> full-upgrade is the new name for "dist-upgrade" in aptitude from Lenny onwards.  Remember that "dist-upgrade" is not about moving from one release to another but installing new packages (ask me about <dist-upgrade>); read man apt-get carefully.  Some security fixes will require a "full-upgrade" not just a "safe-upgrade" to apply.  Ask me about <why not dist upgrade> <dist-upgrade> <safe-upgrade> <apt-listchanges>
[18:17:15] <jelly> oj, both probably, but I don't use unstable and situation there changes all the time
[18:18:01] <oj> Any danger in running full-upgrade? I only remember using it when upgrading stable versions
[18:18:15] <jelly> read what dpkg said.
[18:18:35] <oj> Alright, thanks for the help!
