[00:54:45] <army> anny idea how to fix this https://regex101.com/r/uc0kar/1
[00:54:53] <army> to not match the word kiss
[00:55:39] <yitz> Are you building a whitelist/blacklist?
[00:55:42] <yitz> Or a regex>
[00:56:29] <army> regex
[00:56:34] <army> for badword
[00:57:25] <yitz> Why not just use a blacklist?
[00:57:42] <army> what u mean blacklist ?
[00:58:04] <yitz> Either a list of strings that you check one by one ... or even a |-separated list of words
[00:58:13] <yitz> some|word|or|another
[00:58:27] <army> is a lot
[00:58:42] <army> to add in 1 line
[00:58:55] <army> have a lot combination
[01:00:56] <yitz> Write them one word per line to a file then concatenate with a |
[01:01:30] <army> is for ircd spamfilter
[01:01:41] <yitz> Trying to cram it into a dense regex that matches some words and not others and requires debugging ... are you trying to say screen real estate? Do the words take up too much memory?
[01:03:13] <yitz> Don't create problems just to have a problem that needs solving. Matching a list of words is easy and fast
[01:03:31] <army> i know what u mean

[10:28:43] <loganlee> hi guys. here https://levelup.gitconnected.com/nginx-map-comparison-regular-express-229120debe46 it has pattern ^(?<u>[^\?]+)\?(?:.*)?
[10:28:56] <loganlee> i understand it except for ? at the end. what does it do?
[10:31:04] <Me-me> Hmm. Honestly, nothing. The * being on the only thing on the inside means that that will always match, so making the group that that is in be also optional is redundant
[10:31:29] <loganlee> but why ? is there at the end?
[10:33:01] <Me-me> ? is a quantifier. It's making (?:.*) match zero or one times. In other words, it's optional.
[10:33:19] <loganlee> i see
[10:33:36] <loganlee> thx!
[10:33:39] <Me-me> But since the .* is already able to match nothing, it's useless.
[10:33:44] <loganlee> yep
[10:34:04] <loganlee> * is zero or more
[10:34:18] <loganlee> :-D
[10:34:25] <Me-me> Yup.

[10:51:36] <Me-me> (?:[^,]*,){22}\K,
[10:51:49] <Me-me> (?:[^,]*+,){22}\K,
[10:53:02] <fire101-quail-88> ah okay... so that doesn't work on vscode
[10:53:22] <Me-me> I did ask :D
[10:53:37] <Me-me> Miscommunication, let's look it up.
[10:53:41] <fire101-quail-88> sorry! didn't realize!
[10:53:48] <Me-me> Ah, .net regex. Sure.
[10:53:57] <fire101-quail-88> JavaScript-based regex
[10:54:00] <fire101-quail-88> ah okay
[10:54:11] <Me-me> I thought it was vscode?
[10:54:24] <fire101-quail-88> yep...
[10:54:34] <Me-me> That's visualstudio, right?
[10:54:40] <fire101-quail-88> someone mentioned it was javascript based but that might be wrong
[10:54:42] <fire101-quail-88> yes 
[10:55:09] <Me-me> Right. Javascript is about as barebones as it gets. So that won't go too well. But .NET can do it easily.
[10:55:38] <Me-me> ,(?<=(?:[^,]+,){23})
[10:56:34] <fire101-quail-88> so this doesn't work... 
[10:56:47] <Me-me> Both of these solutions suppose that you want the entirety of the match to be the comma - and just check its surroundings for the other 22. The other option, which will work in javascript, is to match the 23rd comma in a capture group.
[10:56:59] <Me-me> (?:[^,]*,){22}(,)
[10:57:09] <Me-me> Which will work in javascript, PCRE, and .NET too.
[10:57:48] <fire101-quail-88> this works but it matches everything else in between the commas as well
[10:57:55] <fire101-quail-88> instead of just the 23rd comma... 
[10:58:15] <Me-me> Right. Unfortunately, that's the consequence of a more barebones regex. Your pattern will still pick out the 23rd comma, but only as a capture group.
[10:58:26] <Me-me> What are you trying to do?
[10:58:26] <fire101-quail-88> Ah. 
[10:58:46] <fire101-quail-88> Inserting comma after 22 commas
[10:58:58] <Me-me> Can you elaborate?

Regex101 seems to parse my test string as expected, but C#'s groups are different. https://regex101.com/r/iRukVx/4  and heres the C# version: https://prnt.sc/1d06kzx   . I want to match \pi , numbers, and letters that are together so
[12:30:32] <Simon98> that later I can add extra symbols between them. Any ideas why the "40" is getting matched separately in C#?
[12:31:47] <Simon98> In regex101 it matches "40\pi n" as one match and fills out the capture groups like I expect
[12:32:20] <Simon98> but in c# it matches "40" as one match and the capture groups are empty except for group 2 which is just "0" and it separately matches "\pi n"
[12:35:26] <Alex123> digitok so if I want to do sub in python, https://regex101.com/r/Ghr6IV/1 what should I put into groups to make it work?
[12:36:00] <digitok> nothing
[12:36:33] <digitok> r""
[12:36:38] <Simon98> nvm that C# part up there
[12:36:42] <Simon98> https://regex101.com/r/iRukVx/5
[12:37:11] <Simon98> I have the {2,} because im trying to specify that I want each match to contain at least 2 filled in capture groups
[12:37:37] <Simon98> clearly I am misunderstanding. What do I need to change?
[12:37:48] *** Quits: re101-caiman-2 (~re101-cai@84-255-224-242.static.t-2.net) (Quit: Client closed)
[12:38:25] <digitok> i assume the order isn't known?
[12:38:41] <Simon98> order doesn't matter to me
[12:38:47] <digitok> i mean in the data
[12:38:50] <digitok> it's random right
[12:39:13] <Simon98> yes
[12:39:18] <digitok> ok
[12:39:45] <digitok> i see you have ([a-z])+
[12:39:55] <digitok> do you want each letter captured individually?
[12:40:07] <Simon98> 40    \pi    and   x        are variables. You see, this entire mumbo-jumbo is actually a math expression in websites like desmos. My end goal is to separate out all these variables.
[12:40:09] <Simon98> Yep
[12:40:22] <digitok> you're lucky because c# is the only lang that can do that :p
[12:40:45] <digitok> other flavours would just give you the last letter
[12:41:13] <Simon98> sweet!
[12:41:29] *** Quits: I-M (~id@78.183.101.98) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:41:57] <Simon98> So right now, while it's not working exactly as I want, I manually write in code to filter out matches that only have 1 capture group filled in, but I want to do it the RegEx way
[12:42:21] <digitok> and you wouldn't consider "ab" valid right
[12:42:26] <digitok> since it's the same group
[12:42:58] <Simon98> that's ok actually. Since it's 2 letters. If it were just a or b on it's own though, I would ignore it
[12:43:10] <digitok> hmm
[12:43:19] <digitok> ok
[12:44:23] <Alex123> digitok cool thanks works, I had to replace \w with [^\s]+ 
[12:44:39] <digitok> use [^\s=]+
[12:45:02] <Alex123> yup thanks :)
[12:45:07] <digitok> \w is 07a-zA-Z0-9_, so you probably only need to add 14- yea?
[12:45:19] <digitok> if so, 07[\w-] is another option
[12:45:19] <Alex123> yup
[12:45:24] <digitok> up to you
[12:45:34] <Simon98> digitok, heres what the "data" looks like graphically:
[12:45:35] <Simon98> https://pasteboard.co/KbRG6rj.png
[12:46:08] <Simon98> the highlighted bits are 2 separate numbers in math that are multiplied together. It's all those places where multiplication is implied that im targeting
[12:46:34] <digitok> right
[12:47:14] <digitok> just thinking how to do the letters properly
[12:47:19] <digitok> we can't use the ()+ thing
[12:47:36] <digitok> oh, it's .net!
[12:47:39] <digitok> easy
[12:47:49] <Simon98> whatever you have to do. Ill be studying off of your regex probably
[12:48:09] <digitok> well, it's kinda funny
[12:48:20] <digitok> your initial solution is almost correct and would work in c#
[12:48:39] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/iRukVx/6
[12:48:43] <digitok> here's how it'd match in c#
[12:48:50] <digitok> now change 07+ to 14*
[12:49:00] <digitok> :p
[12:51:16] <digitok> a1 is also valid right
[12:51:37] <Simon98> yep
[12:51:43] <digitok> see if this works
[12:51:46] <digitok>   (?:(?<!\\[a-z]*)([a-z])|(?<!\d)(\d+)|(\\pi ?)){2,}

[13:41:05] <DevAntoine> I don't know how to set the "g" flag on this, sorry
[13:41:21] <DevAntoine> I'm trying to match the second and thrid test string but not the first
[13:41:30] <DevAntoine> I don't know how to force the slash
[13:42:56] <DevAntoine> https://regex101.com/r/LjW9q1/2
[13:43:00] <DevAntoine> With the right flags
[13:43:17] <DevAntoine> so, first string matches but should and second doesn't but should
[13:46:45] <purplex> set also an /i flag
[13:47:24] <purplex> the problem is here: (QTT|qtt-\d+) you can remove 'qtt'
[13:49:17] <purplex> do you mean " first string matches but should 35not"?
[14:04:04] <DevAntoine> purplex: yes sorry
[14:04:08] <DevAntoine> first shouldn't
[14:04:12] <DevAntoine> second and thrid should match
[14:04:14] <DevAntoine> third
[14:04:32] <purplex> if you use possessive ?+ it won't match
[14:05:23] <purplex> its because missing / causes backtracking after matching QTT- followed by a number

[14:08:43] <DevAntoine> purplex: nop, it should match qtt with a number
[14:11:45] <purplex> it does that but the 5th test line has no number
[14:12:48] <purplex> in this case, use a * https://regex101.com/r/LjW9q1/4
[14:23:57] <DevAntoine> purplex: awesome, thanks a lot!
[14:27:47] <DevAntoine> purplex: but I don't understand, I'd thought d+ would work but not d* 
[14:27:54] <DevAntoine> But that's the opposite
[14:42:20] <purplex> as i understood you were more concerned about missing / in test data which seems like a user typo/error i.e. you don't want 1st line to match and you want regex to handle that 'bad data' which is not always a good idea. I added ?+ because of (1) d* because of (2) you don't want to match 1.) feat/QTT-4782display-quotation-contract and 2.) feat/QTT-display-quotation-contract where a QTT-4782 is present but no / and QTT- without number.
[14:44:41] <purplex> i would simply use https://regex101.com/r/LjW9q1/5 otherwise assuming bad cases won't occur.

[22:10:29] *** Joins: ttys000 (~ttys000@user/ttys000)
[22:12:49] <ash_worksi> interestingly, although that's DRYer, it is the same amount of characters (or longer if you use `?:`) as just repeating the the non-comma'd group

[22:20:45] <re101-gibbon-61> https://regex101.com/r/M1bgAO/1 - Need ECMAScript Capture for this.
[22:21:01] <re101-gibbon-61> Description:
[22:21:02] <re101-gibbon-61> How can I get the KEYS and VALUES from this using ECMAScript?:
[22:21:02] <re101-gibbon-61> This works in PCRE, but ECMA does not support this.
[22:21:27] <re101-gibbon-61> I laid out the KEYS and VALUES at the bottom
[22:28:14] <karhunkynsii> Looks like it doesn't suppert named groups.

[22:34:29] <re101-serval-42> need help in creating a regex which would allow these two inputs: ES73 0182 6724 8802 0156 0753  and 
[22:34:30] <re101-serval-42> ES12 1234 1234 12 0123456789
[22:35:28] <re101-serval-42> the string should start with ES followed by numbers and spaces..thanks in advance!

[22:42:59] <purplex> re101-gibbon-61, named groups are supported, its the conditional which are unsupported
[22:46:46] <re101-serval-42> thanks a lot karhunkynsii!!
[22:47:47] <re101-serval-42> thanks re101-gibbon-61!..the regex seems like its looking for the start of the string but ignoring the rest
[22:58:31] <re101-gibbon-61> purplex, yes, perhaps another way to write the expression?
[22:58:47] <purplex> yes one sec
[22:59:23] <re101-gibbon-61> I assumed based on your paste. you just needed to capture from ES to end of line.
[22:59:29] <purplex> https://regex101.com/r/LNy9so/1
[22:59:44] <purplex> i hope you can create named groups 
[23:00:34] <purplex> i did it from scratch ^
[23:04:22] <purplex> anyway i did it, wasn't sure of javascript named group syntax https://regex101.com/r/LNy9so/2 now you can test it
[23:07:44] <re101-gibbon-61> Yes, worked great first try.  Thanks.
