[19:37:49] <slaughter> Probably one of the worst things about YAML (and JSON, sometimes, but I mostly see it in YAML) is that because it's such a syntax driven config language, docs seem to just omit things all the time - assuming that because it's YAML you'll just know what goes where
[19:38:43] <slaughter> Also all the platform specific YAML linters seem to suck for some reason. Red squigglies everywhere all the time. I don't know what that's about
[19:39:06] <lantech19446> slaughter: I agree completely
[19:39:35] <slaughter> And if you work with YAML and don't use vim....god rest your soul
[19:40:26] <lantech19446> why vim?
[19:41:26] <slaughter> Other than it being the superior editor?
[19:41:42] * slaughter prepares for editor wars
[19:41:59] <lantech19446> i usually just write it in yaml unless it's something overly complex but does vim offer something especially useful for yaml?
[19:42:10] <lantech19446> sorry I just write it in nano
[19:42:21] <slaughter> Nah really I say that because line yanking/deleting/putting/indentation is super consistent and easy
[19:42:29] *** Joins: roltux (~roltux@87.237.97.247)
[19:42:36] <lantech19446> o ok
[19:42:39] <slaughter> Nano has some built in functions that will achieve the same effect, I think? There's cut/paste line right?
[19:42:47] <lantech19446> yea
[19:43:05] <slaughter> I used to be on the nano train, then I spent some time forcing myself to learn vim
[19:43:16] <slaughter> And holy god dude it was probably one of the top 5 choices in my tech career
[19:43:50] <slaughter> I'm nowhere near a vim power user, but it still speeds up my work considerably
[19:43:51] <lantech19446> I normally don't do my coding on the server I use vscode or pycharm or brackets and most of the time git
[19:44:16] <slaughter> I actually usually use vscode with https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asvetliakov.vscode-neovim
[19:44:17] <lantech19446> that's how i know the ansible yaml linters suck
[19:45:03] <slaughter> I do still use nvim in the terminal fairly often but most actual work happens in VSC. That extension is pretty amazing
[19:46:54] <lantech19446> I don't know enough about vim or neovim to give it a run for its money
[19:48:02] <slaughter> I'd implore you to give it a shot when you have some bored free time
[19:48:56] <slaughter> Just when you're not doing anything else and don't wanna dive in on anything at the moment, run vimtutor and learn ya some stuff
[19:49:12] <slaughter> Vim keys are everywhere, getting used to basic navigation has a bit of a ripple effect
[19:51:21] <slaughter> Also being able to do `d9j` to remove 9 lines of yaml, then just `p` to drop it in a new spot with preserved indentation? Yummm
[19:52:49] <slaughter> Oh the indentation is not quite right? `>9j` and now we've indented those 9 lines to the right once. Need to do it 2 more times? `.` then `.` - you have now - without touching the mouse or holding shift or anything like that - moved a 9 line section of code and fixed indentation in less than 10 keystrokes
[19:54:18] <lantech19446> nice
[19:54:32] <lantech19446> i'll give it a shot one of these days 
[19:54:59] <lantech19446> I keep thinking about how I can use docker at work but docker seems like it's going to be such a pain in the ass to learn
[19:55:39] <rawtaz> vim++
[19:55:53] <rawtaz> if i ever get started with emcas, i will use vim mode in it, thats for sure
[19:56:13] <rawtaz> docker isnt hard to learn
[19:56:24] <rawtaz> but run it on linux if you want the best experience
[19:56:45] <slaughter> Docker is easy to learn, hard to master
[19:58:22] <rawtaz> well put :>
[19:58:39] <rawtaz> and securing it is additional learning besides just running stuff with it

[20:06:02] <lantech19446> I had thought about building pihole in a container on ubuntu using networkchucks container image but i'm already actively talking to checkpoint about their solution
[20:10:06] <rawtaz> solution for what? protecting kids from their attempts at getting p0rn? pihole wont help you lots with that - as we concluded that stuff has to be done on the endpoint (if you want it done properly)
