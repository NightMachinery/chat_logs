[02:23:31] <thebombzen> or does it have to be done before decoding
[02:23:50] <kepstin> no, that has to be done after decoding. but i can't decode the video in the first place :)
[02:24:45] <kepstin> "MVC" is a kinda strange add-on to H.264 that implements the second eye for stereoscopic video by encoding a difference from the first eye
[02:25:12] <kepstin> and ffmpeg doesn't support decoding that difference part of the image, so I can't currently get the second eye image at all.

[05:18:33] <tm512> tried asking about this several days ago, but is there any good way to use ffmpeg to capture single windows on wayland? kmsgrab with a crop filter immediately comes to mind but it seems like there is no standardized way to get the size and position of a wayland window, seems like in some compositors there's no way at all to get that information
[05:19:33] <tm512> it seems like OBS relies on pipewire for capturing video from wayland windows, so I'm wondering if there's any way that pipewire can pump video into ffmpeg

[06:00:08] <kepstin> yeah, the only way to get a single window is to ask the wayland compositor nicely for the data. ffmpeg does not currently have the pipewire & dbus stuff needed to use the xdg portal to ask compositors like gnome-shell for window capture.

[06:33:21] <tm512> I'm wondering if v4l2 could be a viable way for ffmpeg and pipewire to communicate. I see there's this kernel module available called v4l2loopback that creates something analogous to what snd-aloop provides for ALSA. if pipewire can send window capture to one end of the v4l2 loopback, then ffmpeg could pull it out at the other end

[07:18:39] <kode54> you're down to what the wayland compositor lets you capture
[07:19:20] <kode54> hell, the fact that any compositors let you capture at all is considered a blessing
[07:19:40] <kode54> since half of the "security" bs that wayland affords is that apps can't peek at each other's windows
[07:23:45] <tm512> I wish there was just a way to be able to click on a window and get its size and position. just having that feature would sort everything out

[10:19:30] <kepstin> well, wayland compositors - or at least gnome-shell - does provide a way to get a video stream of a window, but does not provide a way to find out where a window is on the screen.
[10:20:59] <kepstin> adding an xdg portal capture device to ffmpeg's actually kind of annoyingly complicated, since the interface is async and can tak a long time (the app asks for a video stream, and then the compositor displays a confirmation popup and window selector that needs user interaction)
[10:23:10] <kepstin> i think to do that in ffmpeg itself, the input initialization would have to block while waiting for the window selection.

[16:09:25] <mort> Hey, is there a way to get the name of the particular decoder used by the AVCodecCtx? (the codec->name and codec->long_name properties are obviously just the generic name of the codec, such as h264, not the name of the implementation such as libx264 or whatever)
[16:09:53] *** Joins: mpv-issue (~pwz@host-87-4-42-167.retail.telecomitalia.it)
[16:10:41] <BtbN> h264 _is_ the name of the libavcodec native h264 decoder.
[16:10:45] <BtbN> libx264 is not a decoder
[16:11:02] <mpv-issue> Hello everyone.. I'm trying to record live tv stream but mpv doesn't seem to help using command syntax like  mpv --stream-record=dw.mp4 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9KZGs1MtP4' ... I'm wondering if ffmpeg maybe an alternative and what is the possible syntax
[16:11:40] <mort> BtbN: I know libx264 isn't a decoder, it's an encoder, it was just an example of the implementation name rather than the codec name
[16:11:53] <mort> but if the implementation name is just h264 then that makes sense

[16:15:22] <mort> for some reason, av_read_frame() gives me packets sans the NAL unit header, so the decoder complains that no start code is found and that it couldn't split the input into NAL units
[16:16:11] <BtbN> Sounds like you need h264_mp4toannexb
[16:16:34] <BtbN> Though unless you are using a really old version, that should be auto-inserted if needed
[16:20:15] <mort> seems like I have libavcodec version 58.91.100
[16:20:35] <mort> that doesn't seem *too* old
[16:21:07] <mort> BtbN: I'm not using ffmpeg from the command line though, I'm using libav* from some C code

[16:32:22] <Kadigan> Hm, I'm confused. -show_entries stream=nb_read_packets,r_frame_rate,codec_name,codec_tag_string returns them in order codec,string,fps,frames. I assume this might have something to do with the order of availability, but that then makes me wonder if there's some way to ENSURE that I get a particular order of these - or, with -of csv, a header?

[18:31:00] <mort> Alright, I don't understand. This is my diff from trying to modernize some libavcodec API usage: https://p.mort.coffee/Wt7.auto -- the old version works, the new version receives an invalid argument error from avcodec_send_packet
[18:31:43] <mort> from what I can tell the old and new code *should* be 100% equivalent
[18:33:13] <mort> the only real difference is that the old code used the AVCodecContext from the stream in the AVFormatContext while the new code has to create its own AVCodecContext from the stream's AVCodecParameters
