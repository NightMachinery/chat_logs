[01:16:17] <droid3> i had a brainfart today. My issue is this. For a metric space to be complete every cauchy sequence must converge in that metric space. But cauchy sequences in general dont need to converge at all they could oscillate or have many limit points?
[01:16:43] <dauggy_> why is this function non-convex? https://imgur.com/a/mMeEXFl
[01:16:52] <Franciman> droid3: exactly
[01:16:53] <droid3> I know every cauchy sequence has a convergent subsequence that pretty easy to show by definition actually it has as many different ones as there are limit points.
[01:17:01] <Franciman> they can be cauchy
[01:17:06] <Franciman> but the limit could not exist
[01:17:12] <somiaj> droid3: I doubt they are going to oscillate or have many limit points.
[01:17:15] <riv> i thought cauchy sequenecs were convergent
[01:17:29] <Franciman> only in a complete space
[01:17:35] <somiaj> droid3: cauchy sequences are basically convergent. If the space is not complete, then it converges to a point not in the space.
[01:17:41] <Franciman> exactly
[01:17:56] <riv> I remember that a bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence
[01:18:09] <somiaj> droid3: so a cauchy sequence in a non-complete metric space (like Q) will act like a convergence sequence, it is just converging to something not in Q
[01:18:17] <somiaj> well not in that space (Q as an example)
[01:18:28] <biberao> droid3: i heard the noise
[01:19:23] <somiaj> droid3: I should have said, it may not converge to something in that metric space, (which means it is convergenging to something outside the space you could add to make the space complete)
[01:19:35] <droid3> but cauchy sequences in general dont need to converge you can have a sequence {xn} which is cauchy |xm - xn| <e gets smaller and smaller but xn doesnt approach a limit

[01:20:19] <somiaj> if the space is non-complete, yes, but it won't act like other non-convergent sequences (it will have zero limit points)
[01:20:30] <droid3> the point is it doesnt have to converge at all. Though we have always convergent subsequence.
[01:20:36] <somiaj> nope
[01:20:40] <somiaj> no convergent subsequence

[01:22:10] <droid3> convergent sequence always implies it is a cauchy sequence. But not the other way around so how can you assume for the definition of completeness that every cauchy sequence converges in the metric space/space. Your forgetting the possibility of it not converging at all.
[01:22:55] <somiaj> The only reason why a cauchy sequence won't converge is if it would converge to a point outside of your metric space
[01:23:20] <somiaj> the definition of completness is not an assumption, it is a definition. In a complete metric space, every cauchy sequence converges
[01:24:11] <droid3> I am not confused about it converging in the space or not with the definition of this completeness. What i am confused about is how we can assume that cauchy sequences always converge to either in the space or out of the space. It may not converge at all?
[01:24:18] <somiaj> in general cauchy sequences are almost convergent, the problem is they could possibly converge to something outside of your space, hence completness there is nothing outside of your space a cauchy sequence could converge to, since every cauchy sequence converges.

[01:25:12] <somiaj> But they reason a cauchy sequence may not converge is because of the space, not because of the sequence.
[01:25:48] <somiaj> It isn't going to have multiple limit points, and it is bounded so it isn't going to run away to infinity.
[01:26:07] <riv> if a sequence has two limit points, it is not a cauchy sequence

[01:31:49] <droid3> O thanks riv i kind of see the proof a cauchy sequence has to converge to something (possible not in your space though ). And when you define completeness that restricts the cauchy sequence from converging always in the space.
[01:32:43] *** Joins: XCode|2 (~XCode@d108-173-59-218.abhsia.telus.net)
[01:33:00] <droid3> My wrong thought was we could cook up some cauchy sequence {(-1)^n} of an oscillatory nature but no such example can be given because as you said it have two or more limit points and one can prove a cauchy sequence cannt have more then one limit point
[01:33:34] *** Joins: Simplar (~Simplar@188.163.92.225)
[01:33:59] <droid3> {(-1)^n} example is not cauchy but it is an example of oscillatory action. Which has a convergent subsequence.
[01:35:16] <droid3> So all sequences have a convergent subsequence. But the cauchy sequences always converge its just they may not converge with a limit in your space. OK OK i see now i recall it. Stupid me thanks guys.
[01:35:46] <droid3> And now i see how the e-delta proof would go.

[01:50:22] <Z-module> right, none that gives its usual topology
[01:50:22] <droid3> What i was thinking though if you didnt have a metric if there was away to define completeness just using neighborhoods but what your eluding to is you kind of need the metric at least or being under a metric space to even define a space being complete or incomplete.

Not to mention much easier to work with when you got distance function as opposed to working with filters , intersections and membership of set neighboorhoods.
[01:56:26] <droid3> Cool though so completeness does generalize like compactness, connectedness ,countability, and separability properties of topological spaces.
[01:56:27] <isekaijin> Not to *any* topological space.

[02:12:51] <droid3> well if you want then to converge in the space but they will converge just not maybe in the space.
[02:14:13] <somiaj> although that is useful intuition, when you are stuck in some space, you can't really talk about stuff not in the space, so the result is there is no convergent subsequence.
[02:14:47] <isekaijin> droid3: It is more accurate to say that every metric M space has a completion \bar{M}, such that (a) there is a canonical embedding M -> \bar{M}, and (b) the image of every Cauchy sequence in M is a convergente sequence in \bar{M}.
[02:14:49] <somiaj> In general when dealing with limits of sequences, complete metric spaces are just nicer. That is one of the main reason we use the real numbers

[02:16:57] <droid3> right i was mainly getting at the fact your bounded theorem doesnt imply that if it wasnt complete the sequence wouldnt converge somewhere.
[02:17:12] <droid3> But i agree and see your point a more general point is this.
[02:17:20] <isekaijin> Otherwise, ignoring metrics, I think you can make any sequence convergent, simply by attaching a new point p to X, whose only neighborhood in X \cup {p} is all of X \cup {p}.
[02:17:33] <isekaijin> (Of course, X \cup {p} is not a metric space, since it is not even Hausdorff.)

[02:25:04] <droid3> curious is there any good algorithmic way to determine if a metric space is complete. As we talked about earlier there can be many different metrics defined for the same metric space.
[02:25:32] <droid3> This would entail proving all of them not complete or exhibiting one of them complete.
[02:25:49] <droid3> Can this be done in general?
[02:26:14] <isekaijin> Do you even have a “data structure” to represent an arbitrary metric space?
[02:26:45] <droid3> i mean given a metric one can prove it to be incomplete or complete that i little less difficult but proving that for a particular metric space it has no complete metric seem much harder.

[02:27:32] <somiaj> what do you mean by 'proving that for a particular metric space it has no complete metric'
[02:27:46] <somiaj> to have a metric space, you must have a defined metric that is either complete or not complete.

[02:45:14] <somiaj> you can show the limit is cos(a), though what you shared is just rubbish
[02:45:44] <somiaj> L'Hopitals rule once is enough, first split it up, you know that lim x->a^+ cos(x) = cos(a), so ignore that part (since cos is bounded)
[02:46:03] <somiaj> use L'Hopital's on just the lim x->a^+ ln(x-a)/ln(e^x - e^a), and it works out fairly nicely

[03:11:12] <droid3> but there really cool theories and powerful theories that you can use to do alot of cool/neat things.
[03:12:06] <TuckerBrandy1997> I have a question: lim x -> -inf x^2e^x
[03:12:22] <TuckerBrandy1997> now i know this is indeterminate form
[03:12:35] <TuckerBrandy1997> I can either put x^2 or e^x to denom
[03:12:47] <droid3> many different ways to define homology/cohomologies and most by Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms become equivalent so its like many different equivalent invariant none of which are complete invariants.
[03:13:15] <TuckerBrandy1997> if i have x^2 to denom, i seems to end up having an infinite problem
[03:14:04] <somiaj> TuckerBrandy1997: thus seems like putting e^x in the denominator would be more useful in this case.
[03:14:20] <droid3> here is a stupid question that can confuse a beginner algebraic topologist. Is the 2-manifold torus simply connected? And is the 3-manifold torus simple connected ?
[03:14:56] <droid3> The answer guys is for the dim 2 surface torus is not simple connected by taking a loop around the torus.
[03:15:27] <droid3> However dim 3 torus is simple connected because you have the solid between the surface that you can pass thru.
[03:16:16] <droid3> Not many people explain this when they talk about manifolds , simple connectedness , and torus stuff. And its a great point to realize.
[03:16:25] <Z-module> the usual (2-dimensional) torus is S^1 x S^1, so pi_1(that) = Z x Z
[03:16:56] <droid3> That stuff in dim 2 not being simple connected doesnt apply that it wont be simple connect of the same object in dimensions above.
[03:17:34] <droid3> I meant the higher dim versions because you fill in the space in center ...etc
[03:17:54] <TuckerBrandy1997> somiaj yeah i notice that, but why do i get different ans :O

[03:26:37] <droid3> Its a little confusing how one proceeds to generalize higher genus definitions and i imagine they have to line up with the homology/cohomology theories aka the homology/cohomology groups.
[03:28:22] <droid3> I know one can generalize orientation to higher then 2-manifolds by using the Jacobin determinant. But its hard to see how to generalize genus to higher dimension hypersurfaces and manifolds in the case of algebraic geometry and algebraic/differential topology
[03:29:54] <droid3> Ofcourse most of the time we restrict useful topology application to dim 1,2,3 so we never really talk to much or do much with generalization of genus , orientation.

[03:32:05] <droid3> And if you can generalize genus you probably can generalize euler characteristic as well hummmm. Not sure but maybe its related to homology/cohomology group exact sequences or defined in this manner. However i dont see a geometric based way of thinking about it.
[03:32:50] <droid3> And it loses most of its geometric appeal or link to the genus of lower dim 2 surfaces you like to to default to the definition of dim-2 genus if the dimension was 2.
[03:34:05] <droid3> hummmm i know how the betti number works so maybe genus is determined for higher dimensional manifolds and algebraic hypersurfaces as the one of the abelian homology group betti number in the exact sequence of homology theory.
[03:34:28] <droid3> But just not sure how its normally generalized or if it has one normal generalization

[06:49:50] <Guest78> uh
[06:50:32] <laurus> If you use the sigma algebra as B(overline{R}) where overline(R) is the extended reals
[06:50:38] <isekaijin> Should I buy Lang's algebra book if I already own Dummit and Foote? Assume money is not a problem.
[06:50:46] <Guest78> agh
[06:50:56] <laurus> Guest78: this book works out a lot of those details

[06:52:13] <Guest78> also possible that i am just not smart
[06:52:29] <isekaijin> It is likely a matter of style.
[06:52:48] <isekaijin> Lang aims for maximum generality right from the start.

[06:59:55] <laurus> Guest78: I figured out my quandry about simple functions by the way. They are _not_ in the extended reals, but the limit of an increasing sequence of simple functions could be a function on the extended reals.
[07:00:14] <laurus> Guest78: e.g. f_n = n for all n in the natural numbers.

[16:26:01] <cadmio> here L_g(x) = g *x if you change g you also change the action (which is a function) so the permutation representation represents both the action and each g in G
[16:26:12] <greenbagels> yes
[16:27:42] <greenbagels> if you do right multiplication instead of left, and you have a nonabelian group, then you get a different action, for example
[16:27:53] <cadmio> now gx = x would correspond to a permutation having a 1-cycle in its cycle representation if I've understood correctly
[16:28:03] <greenbagels> right
[16:28:22] <cadmio> I'm not convinced about that fact
[16:29:19] <greenbagels> Suppose we fix g
[16:29:37] <greenbagels> then the action, instead of a function act(g,h) : G x G -> G
[16:29:54] <greenbagels> becomes something like act_g(h) : G -> G
[16:30:26] <greenbagels> this is just a permutation of G

[16:45:03] <Z-module> right, for every group action  G x X -> X   at all (any group G, any nonempty set X), for each single g in G, the map X -> X given by  x |-> g.x   is always a permutation on X (a self-bijection on X). You can check that straight from the axioms for a group action.
[16:45:48] <Z-module> in such a way that group multiplication in G corresponds to composition of permutations on X
[16:45:52] <cadmio> that should mean that not only act_g(h) : G -> G is a permutation but also act(g,h) : G x G -> G can be represented by a permutation
[16:47:57] <Z-module> a permutation here only means a bijection from one set onto itself

[17:29:33] <isekaijin> It really depends on context.
[17:32:41] <isekaijin> For example, in control engineering, a “variable” is a value of interest that changes over time (typically the time-dependent variables in a system of ODEs), but a “parameter” is a fixed value that is set by the system's designer.
[17:34:21] <isekaijin> In differential equations, there is a method for solving inhomogeneous ODEs called “variation of parameters”, which really means “replacing the constants of integration with other functions”. Nobody would refer to the constants of integration as “variables”.
[17:34:25] <[itchyjunk]> f(x,y) x,y variable, f(x(t), y(t)) paramatarized or somesuch?
[17:34:46] <isekaijin> Oh, right, that is another use of the term “parameter”.

[19:36:21] <Matt|home> thanks tolarz , i believe you, im just very surprised
[19:36:23] <Sofia> Hmm. Looking back at the paper where I learned Halide used this definition too. I see they accepted the undefinedness and set x/x = 1. Yet the context is for agressively applying rewrite rules, so the missing condition, I expect to only actively break things, transitively, without needing any /0 to ever occur in code. https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~djg/papers/oopsla2021.pdf
[19:37:08] <CuriousErnestBro> I redefined my estimator in terms of partial sums, and my estimator becomes sum(B_t (C_t - C_{t-1})) where B and C are standard brownian motions
[19:37:46] <CuriousErnestBro> but I had X_t -> B_t and Y_t -> C_t (convergence in distribution from the functional central limit theorem)
[19:38:33] <CuriousErnestBro> now I have lim T-> infty sum(B_t (C_t - C_{t-1})) = \int B_t dC_t  (convergence in mean square)
[19:38:58] <CuriousErnestBro> is this argument valid? I don't think so because B_t should be F_{t-1}-measurable which it isn't

[20:26:46] <Z-module> cadmio:  in cycle notation,  (a b c ... y)  means that the permutation sends a to b, and b to c, .... and y back to a.  So your thing works *only* if  gge = e,  ggx_1 = x_1,  ggx_2 = x_2,  etc.

[20:33:00] <cadmio> right so it equals to (e ge) (x_1 gx_1) (x_2 gx_2) (..) because there are no fixed points if not it could be (e ge) (x_1 gx_1) (x_2 gx_2) (x_n)

[22:28:29] <[itchyjunk]> does the concept of gradient carry over to C as is?
[22:28:45] <[itchyjunk]> lot of intuitive ideas from reals seem to not carry over to C even though the math does
[22:29:06] <[itchyjunk]> maybe it's a waste of time to try to decode the intuitive representation in that way for math
[22:29:42] <somiaj> Well maps from C->C are had to visualize as a single graph, since it would require 4D, so a lot of the geometric intuition changes. If you want to use the same words in that case or not is up to convention.
[22:29:52] <isekaijin> [itchyjunk]: The concept of derivative carries over even to algebraic or analytic geometry over arbitrary fields.

[22:34:30] <buster> it reflects the interestingness of the exterior derivative

[22:35:54] <W> I'm often finding myself constructing functions to match some needed features (e.g. roots, asymptotes, envelope) by multiplying together other functions, but multiplying together odd functions often lead to an unwanted zero derivative (and higher derivatives) at zero; it's intuitive that it does, given how powers work near zero, but is there a simple way to avoid it with the product, or should I just treat the derivative at zero as a final feature to add in a new term for

[22:41:02] <isekaijin> The abstract definition of f being differentiable at p does not not require any coordinates.
[22:42:09] <isekaijin> Let V, W be f.d. real vector spaces, and let U be an open subset of V. A function f : U -> W is differentiable at p \in U if there exists a linear map df_p : V -> W such that...
[22:42:31] <isekaijin> Of course, to do actual calculations, you need coordinates, but there is zero need to bake them into the definition.
[22:42:57] <cherim> But this is the standard definition
[22:43:10] <somiaj> Yea, I think it is harder to introduce directional derivatives before partial derivatives. Though usually at that level the idea of being dependent on a coordinate system is mostly taken for granted since almost all things students have seen up to that point has a coordinate system assoicated with it
[22:44:13] <cherim> In 1D differentiability is also defined as existence of a linear function such that..., not as existence of f' defined as limit

[22:56:33] <twJizhan> and nowadays the def. is a linear map having some kinds of property?

[22:58:14] <buster> d3x04, not sure what the question is. but if you change coordinates so that velocity vectors transform as v -> v' = Mv, then a gradient vector or a normal vector transforms as a -> a' = M⁻ᵀa

[23:00:41] <d3x0r> buster well it's not a velocity/acceleartion (thouh the result will be);  I just have several direction vectors defining the skew of a particular point in space from various directions.  The skew is a sort of pressure from displacing the original points;  I dunno I just don't know generally what to call it, and I think Im'just overcomplicating it
[23:00:59] <d3x0r> (defining the skew of the space around a particular point)
[23:02:17] <d3x0r> it's like... aren't ricci curvature tensors able to be combined?  or isn't ther esomehing in this mikowski space for handling multiple sources of hyperbolic deformation
[23:04:41] <blackfield> hello, in a finite field Z_n/(f), where f is some irreducible polynomial, say i have polynomial g and from bezout identity i get some coefficient a,b such that a*f+b*g=1; how can i argue that for some d=x+(f), g(d)^(-1)=b? (since i cannot say v*g≡1 mod (f) hehe)
[23:05:12] <buster> minkowski space is flat. sounds like you should be considering the "original points" in one manifold, and the skewing as a map, whose image you should consider as a separate manifold

[23:11:48] <d3x0r> https://d3x0r.github.io/STFRPhysics/math/mathSphereDecay buster we start with flat space; the lines are in 'light space' that is they are the paths light will take.  If you move the first slider, that increases the displacement of the 0, and shoves the flat space away from itself (in another flat space), and light doesn't really notice.  The tensor of the distortion around that point has a direction normal to the point, which also defines a
[23:11:48] <d3x0r> plane tangent to it.  The stretching of the plane is (S*2pi)^2 for whatever and the height is compressed to 1/S.

[23:12:20] <d3x0r> that graph could be shown in its hyperbolic form, just adding the X/Y position along the lines appropriately...
[23:13:33] <d3x0r> if I had a vector in some direction, and another in a near direction, I can see that I could take (A,B) * (C,D) and get a vector (A*C+A*D, B*C+B*D)   for normal and orthagonal component (I don't really need a second perpendicular?  since the distortion around the opint is reall circular, and it's just some radial offset.
[23:13:56] <d3x0r> but then if the A,C (normal direction) were opposing, then I'd get a negative projection
