[00:29:15] <bpmedley> I wish we could embed or use Kestrel and friends in a Maui MacCatalyst app..
[00:32:35] <Suchiman> bpmedley: why can't you :P? xD
[00:33:06] <bpmedley> Suchiman : with or without unsupported copying of files from the ~/.nuget/packages directory?
[00:36:37] <Suchiman> bpmedley: just add <ItemGroup><FrameworkReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.App" /></ItemGroup> to the csproj
[00:38:08] <bpmedley> There was no runtime pack for Microsoft.AspNetCore.App available for the specified RuntimeIdentifier 'maccatalyst-x64'
[00:39:07] <bpmedley> Although, I can get a binary to run via adding a library with Microsoft.AspNetCore.App referenced and manually copying dlls.
[00:39:14] <bpmedley> However, Kestrel does not load.
[00:39:25] <bpmedley> Quic is not supported or somesuch..
[00:39:51] <Suchiman> hmmmm
[00:41:38] <bpmedley> I wager the logic that disables or skips Quic on osx-x64 does not do so on net6.0-maccatalyst..
[00:42:20] <Suchiman> bpmedley: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/http-3-support-in-dotnet-6/#macos-support
[00:42:56] <bpmedley> True, so, why is Quic even trying to load?
[00:43:04] <Suchiman> no idea

[06:48:20] <bomb> how goes Lukky
[06:50:48] <Lukky> Pretty good actually :-) Working on some web stuff though :-( LOL
[06:50:51] <Lukky> And you?
[06:51:28] <bomb> I make music
[06:52:12] <Lukky> cool... do you use a DAW?
[06:53:40] <Lukky> I use Studio One
[06:54:44] <Lukky> I have a Studio 192 and two DP88 ADAT In/Out modules
[06:55:35] <Lukky> I can track a samll band, that is, if the drummer is not too gong ho about micing his kit :-)
[06:57:53] <Lukky> Some day I'll tear a hole in a wall, put a large window in it, and have me a sound booth and a control room...
[07:00:43] <_Shurik_> Doesn't require all that much of setup to record good tracks
[07:00:57] <_Shurik_> only problem is drumset.  That's a major bitch
[07:01:45] <Lukky> yup
[07:02:12] <Lukky> either the drum set, or the drummer :D

[07:04:02] <Lukky> some more*
[07:04:16] <_Shurik_> - How can you record a drumset with 3 mics?
[07:04:30] <Lukky> hmmm... is that a joke?
[07:04:31] <_Shurik_> - Easy.  Put one in bass drum and give the other two to the drummer

[07:06:01] <bomb> Lukky I use Raper
[07:06:06] <Lukky> Most bands are well equiped in terms of a separate mixer upstream, so as long they don't bring me like 18 channels, I'm cool

[07:07:14] <bomb> Lukky yes. werks on linux macos win, good set of builtin fx

[07:13:54] <bomb> und DrumForge for the drums
[07:14:09] <_Shurik_> use Logic X Pro, kids
[07:14:10] <Lukky> _Shurik_: come again?
[07:14:23] <bomb> pro is nifty. even Artist would do for me :)
[07:14:31] <_Shurik_> the only reason to own a Mac TBH

[07:15:35] <Lukky> ahh

[07:16:30] <_Shurik_> they are patches
[07:16:32] <bomb> whats ur fav vsti then lukky
[07:17:12] <Lukky> I like Diva, OPX-II, some Arturia ones, and then the NI sample based ones
[07:17:20] <bomb> ohh Diva
[07:17:29] <bomb> best virt anal synth ever
[07:17:47] <bomb> uhe good guys, supports linix
[07:17:47] <Lukky> A real powerhouse of sound!
[07:17:57] <bomb> aye
[07:18:20] <bomb> opx ii never tried. guessing is oberheim emu?
[07:18:24] <Lukky> I like to get it to sound like an OB8
[07:19:03] <bomb> Arturia also knows his shit. very good emulations
[07:19:06] <Lukky> yes, very good... I just love Rush, and OPX let me get Camera Eye to a dot (well, almost)!!
[07:19:14] <bomb> rush <3
[07:19:22] <bomb> what do you use fro drums?
[07:20:20] <Lukky> I do some small things on Arturia Spark, but for serious stuff I use my drummer friend
[07:21:01] <bomb> aye, plug him into the mixer heheh
[07:21:03] <Lukky> But since I have NI Komplete, and a few others, I play around... I must admit I suck at coming up with good drum sequences
[07:21:19] <bomb> he plays a MIDI drumkit, I suppose? tuning/recording/mixing an acoustic kit is to much werk
[07:21:31] <_Shurik_> we should do a group music project
[07:21:39] <Lukky> No, old fashion jars

[07:23:02] <bomb> bass bass, rhythm bass running on top 2 strings, and lead bass with chorus and shit
[07:23:11] * bomb punches _Shurik_ male ego
[07:23:37] * _Shurik_ deflects with low B string
[07:23:37] <Lukky> Well, I play more in the mids to fill between the drum and guit...

[11:55:47] <MatthiasVance> Anyway, "complex" types in constructors aren't liked by EF Core?
[11:55:56] <MatthiasVance> I even told it: The containing type owns this type
[11:56:02] <MatthiasVance> Now I don't know what to do :D
[12:01:37] <MatthiasVance> Ah, so you can have navigation properties that are owned types .. but you can't set them in the constructor!
[12:12:34] <svm_invictvs> So, does C# have an equivalent or similar type? https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/Exchanger.html
[12:15:08] <MatthiasVance> svm_invictvs: You could take a look at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.interlocked?view=net-6.0
[12:15:23] <MatthiasVance> "Provides atomic operations for variables that are shared by multiple threads."
[12:15:41] <MatthiasVance> And specifically: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.interlocked.exchange?view=net-6.0
[12:19:50] <svm_invictvs> Yeah, the problem with that is that it doens't do what the Java class does.
[12:19:55] <svm_invictvs> It doesn't block.
[12:20:16] <MatthiasVance> What do you mean by that?
[12:20:26] <MatthiasVance> svm_invictvs: It's an atomic operation
[12:21:05] <svm_invictvs> Thread A passes a value to exchange and it blocks until thread B does the same on the other side or vise versa.
[12:21:31] <MatthiasVance> Are you meaning it doesn't *lock*?
[12:21:41] <svm_invictvs> No, block.
[12:21:52] <svm_invictvs> As in the thread has to wait until the value is available.

[13:24:14] <MichaelLong> damn I don't get this logging injection stuff in .net core...
[13:25:40] <MatthiasVance> MichaelLong: Why not?
[13:27:13] <MichaelLong> it is new for me at the moment. I'm using nlog as a backend, but I don't understand how you create logging instances for various classes throughout my code. Have it running at the moment in the startup project which is a console app
[13:28:19] <MatthiasVance> You can request an ILogger<T> in your constructor

[15:55:08] <MichaelLong> MatthiasVance, yes sure. I'm using this example here https://github.com/NLog/NLog/wiki/Getting-started-with-.NET-Core-2---Console-application I was wondering if I have to use this serviceProvider each time I'm using another class that needs logging or if it can be done inside each class without passing a logger interface. Not familiar with the construct at all yet. Unfortunately every time it get interesting I've other stuff to do. I'll dig into it in
[15:55:09] <MichaelLong> the evening though, thx for help.
[15:57:49] <MatthiasVance> MichaelLong: What is the reason you're using NLog btw?
[15:58:29] <MatthiasVance> MichaelLong: What do you mean "use this serviceProvider", are you not familiar with dependency injection?

[15:59:21] <MatthiasVance> Ah sorry, I read parts at different times xD
[15:59:25] <MatthiasVance> And only replied to the last part I read
[15:59:56] <MatthiasVance> MichaelLong: You set up the service provider once in your application, then instantiate the object tree using that provider (like they do with Runner) and in those classes you use whatever you want
[16:02:08] <MichaelLong> MatthiasVance, that's how I'm using it now.
[16:02:17] <MatthiasVance> So what's the issue? :D
[16:02:46] <edcba> would be nice if we could evaluate expression directly in logs! :p
[16:02:59] <MatthiasVance> Yeah and especially if we could load some stuff from the network
[16:03:03] <MatthiasVance> And by network I mean internet
[16:03:16] <MatthiasVance> LDAP seems commonly used?
[16:03:18] <MichaelLong> but regarding this example, they use .AddTransient<Runner> (forgive me I havent had the time to look the all up). so it is specific to runner.
[16:03:24] <MichaelLong> edcba, yeah sure why not! :D
[16:03:27] <edcba> yeah how else would you get name of users
[16:03:35] <MatthiasVance> MichaelLong: No
[16:03:47] <MatthiasVance> MichaelLong: AddTransient returns the same instance, nothing logging specific
[16:04:07] <MatthiasVance> It's just a fluent API
[16:04:12] <MatthiasVance> So you can keep adding .AddX() things
[16:04:21] <MatthiasVance> So first AddTransient, then AddLogging, and so on

[20:16:46] <gnooger> Hi everyone, is this a good place to ask about code signing? Or is there a more specific channel for that
[20:17:10] <JakeSays> #codesigning
[20:17:25] <gnooger> ;-)
[20:18:12] <gnooger> I'll just go ahead and ask: I was given a new certificate by management because the existing one expired two months ago, so we haven't been able to publish
[20:18:39] <gnooger> The new certificate yields "SignTool Error: SignedCode::Sign returned error: 0x80090027" when I try to use it. I haven't been able to find any meaningful google results for that
[20:19:06] <gnooger> I thought something might be wrong with the certificate, however it successfully signs our .msi file when I use it with the digicert util
[20:20:24] <brianonymous> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39999664/windows-how-to-sign-exe-using-certificate-issued-by-certum
[20:21:13] <gnooger> I found that one, using "/fd SHA256" doesn't change the result (neither does /fd SHA384 for that matter)
[20:21:35] <brianonymous> what about that pk2 crap
[20:21:39] <Diablo-D3> jesus christ thats nightmare
[20:22:51] <gnooger> I don't think the pk2 stuff is relevant for me, as I have a .pfx file containing everything already

[20:23:14] <gnooger> Also we didn't buy it from certum, it's a sectigo certificate
[20:23:31] <brianonymous> sure, but usually key is key
[20:23:39] <brianonymous> i was just going with error id
[20:24:18] <gnooger> I did merge the .key and .crt to a .pfx file
[20:26:30] <gnooger> It's probably an oddly specific parameter required in signtool.exe that will make everything work magically; this is super frustrating
[20:27:58] <brianonymous> thatd be my guess. i assumed 80090027 is invalid param
[20:28:27] <Diablo-D3> [11:52:54] <JakeSays> sent this email to a company in reply to on they sent me: ""No SD-Card needed!. Runs Linus on internal flash" - how did you get Linus to fit on those little boards?  :)" - their reply: "4GB Flash"
[20:28:43] <Diablo-D3> jesus christ that flash is huge
[20:28:48] <Diablo-D3> I could fit at least three linuses in there
[20:28:51] <Diablo-D3> linusii?
[20:29:01] <Diablo-D3> maybe linus is singular plural
[20:29:18] <gnooger> Yes correct, 80090027 is invalid parameter, but I'm not sure that it means invalid signtool.exe parameter (as I said: when I use Visual Studio I get the same error)
[20:30:09] <gnooger> I also tried different versions of signtool.exe (granted, both of them from the Windows 10 SDK), same result
