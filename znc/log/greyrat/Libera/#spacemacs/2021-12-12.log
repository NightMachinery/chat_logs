[02:55:02] <FromGitter> <whvod> hello, I am trying to upgrade my old spacemacs so I deleted my old ./emacs.d folder and my .spacemacs, I'm trying to instal via the git commands and am getting an error in my init file, also I always have this TLS error about connecting to melpa.gnu.org. Really looking to update to the develop branch but the stable version also has the same errors  as the ones above
[02:55:59] <FromGitter> <hsheikhali1> @dkovacevic15 i managed to get it working just  fine now. But im running into another issue... how do I specify prettier to format with the config in the root of the project?
[03:10:07] <FromGitter> <whvod> does anyone have a good link or guide for how to setup python with pipenv for spacemcas. I want to do live programming with it and I'm not sure where the paths for python emacs uses are?
[03:24:53] <FromGitter> <hsheikhali1> ^ You and me both @whvod - I'm kind of struggling trying to get my dev env setup for typescript, scss, tsx etc.. It seems when I get really close to having the same experience on spacemacs that I have on neovim something acts weird.. in this case prettier is formatting just fine but isn't using the right config I think..
