[00:00:51] <rb> i guess?
[00:01:08] <JordiGH> The recruiters sent me this beautiful propaganda about how much this company loves software devs and how much they pamper me.
[00:01:16] <JordiGH> *pamper them
[00:01:21] <JordiGH> Time to put it to the test!
[00:01:39] <rb> i mean i'd just eat the cost for that, i'd consider it petty for myself to ask someone to pay my lunch for the day of the interview
[00:01:45] <rb> not saying you're being petty, that's just how i see it
[00:01:54] <JordiGH> Well, eating is what I plan to do.
[00:02:03] <rb> right, i'd just buy myself something
[00:02:10] <rb> probably better than what they'd buy me anyway :P
[00:02:33] <JordiGH> Honestly, I'm looking at a 30 CAD bill here. It's mostly symbolic pocket change.

[12:11:44] <iDrougge> vgel: I'm also not convinced that Rust is in any way a good choice.
[12:12:44] <iDrougge> Objective-C, which to your average developer is horrid in so many ways, has served Apple (and NeXT) very well for building an operating system because it is so malleable.
[12:12:59] <iDrougge> Rust is the antithesis to that.

[12:19:37] <bradfier> iDrougge: Rust definitely doesn’t map nicely onto the model most GUI frameworks use, but I don’t see it being an inherently bad choice. Pragmatically, anywhere you would start a greenfield project in C++, I think Rust is a reasonable choice
[12:19:42] <bradfier> If you’re happy with the trade offs
[12:20:00] <bradfier> However as to S76 making another DE, yeah that just feels like fragmentation for fragmentations sake
[12:20:19] <bradfier> However I’ve seen other people try and work with the GNOME folks and I understand why they gave up
[12:21:05] <iDrougge> bradfier: C++ is probably also a worse choice than Objective-C.
[12:21:36] <bradfier> Nobody uses O-C outside of Mac land so it’s not really a practical choice
[12:21:53] <iDrougge> By any means, if you are going to use Rust, you will need to seriously rethink your architecture or quickly wind up in cul-de-sac.
[12:22:10] <iDrougge> bradfier: Well, nobody uses Rust either.
[12:22:45] <bradfier> For desktop environments or in general? Because I have 300kloc of production code that disagrees
[12:23:23] <iDrougge> You will find Objective-C diehards with 300 kloc of production code as well.
[12:23:53] <bradfier> It would be like starting a new Linux DE using Swift, sure it might be a fun language and might even be perfect for the use case but the company sponsoring its development isn’t incentivised to encourage use outside its walled garden
[12:24:06] <bradfier> It would be akin to starting the project in dotNet

[12:25:34] <bradfier> (iPhone keyboards make me weep)
[12:25:42] <iDrougge> Obj-C is an incredibly dynamic language, Swift is very statical like Rust.

[16:41:02] <iDrougge> It doesn't, does it?
[16:41:27] <riv> personally I would have just used a single metacharacter, \ for all escaping
[16:42:04] <iDrougge> Swift uses \() for string interpolation. print("A string containing \(an expression)")
[16:42:20] <iDrougge> So it aligns with all other control sequences.
[16:44:51] <iDrougge> I really need to search through this codebase for "200". Its developer seems to think that that any other HTTP response code is an error.
[16:46:05] <riv> I think that \( ... ) thing is pretty bad too
[16:46:20] <riv> it's the reverse of what i'd expect
[16:46:59] <riv> hm although in C we have %% for printing a % symbol
[16:47:04] <riv> instead of \%
[16:47:13] <riv> maybe it's not as simple as I was thinking
[16:47:26] <iDrougge> Well, \n doesn't render an n, so \() doesn't render a parenthesis.
[16:47:41] <riv> you're right! that's a good point
[16:47:44] <iDrougge> I think looking to C for inspiration is to look in the wrong place.
[16:47:48] <riv> haha
[16:47:50] <riv> very true

[16:49:00] <edk> C's % thing is pretty much necessary since string formatting isn't part of the language
[16:49:34] <iDrougge> But if you're not implementing C, you don't have to repeat its design.
[16:49:40] <edk> in languages where it is things may be different. \(...) weirds me out though
[16:50:27] <iDrougge> Kotlin does it like println("A string containing a $variable")
[16:50:47] <iDrougge> or println("A string containing an ${expression}")
[16:50:56] <edk> if variables usually have sigils then reusing the sigil for string interpolation makes sense
[16:51:12] <edk> i'm unconvinced that using $ for string interpolation makes sense in any other world
[16:51:35] <riv> yeah rust has ${} as well
[16:51:56] <riv> I suppose \{} is "better" but for some reason \ is less readable
[16:52:25] <riv> i've come around to \() , now I actually think it's good
[16:53:51] <iDrougge> edk: What would you suggest?
[16:54:03] <edk> i'm not sure
[16:55:51] <edk> i wouldn't hate the idea of a language just not doing string interpolation; i think it's one of the more overused features
[16:56:58] <mockturtle> What are you doing this weekend? [programming ask] (caius) https://lobste.rs/s/q3p756
[16:57:05] <iDrougge> I think such limitations lead to evolutional blind alleys just like forbidding user-defined operators.
[16:57:32] <iDrougge> In the name of purity, I can appreciate an even purer version of C that doesn't have string literals.
[16:57:43] <edk> it's not about purity for me
[16:58:01] <riv> I suppose you can look at it in layers
[16:58:10] <riv> string literals are purely about encoding a sequence of characters
[16:58:15] <edk> it's just that people use string interpolation all the time when it's available and this introduces challenges to things like localization
[16:58:21] <iDrougge> But if you don't have string interpolation, you will end up with C format strings or Java string builders.
[16:58:22] <riv> format strings are string literals - but the sequence of characters has its own metacharacters and escaping and so on
[16:58:34] <edk> python and C# have opt-in interpolated string literals which interpret bare {foo}
[16:58:37] <edk> i think that's ok
[16:58:40] <riv> so you have two levels of string escaping and quotation
[16:58:59] <edk> (ok as in it has the same problem as string interpolation in general; it's just nicer syntax)

[16:59:50] <riv> oh yeah true, in some languages every string is a format string
[17:00:45] <edk> there are choices besides C format strings and Java string builders but i think it's worth noting that C format strings aren't immune to localization the way string interpolation is
[17:01:22] <iDrougge> String interpolation really isn't either, though most implementations are.
[17:01:24] <edk> also in languages with string interpolation but no custom interpolation for things like SQL or shell, it's too tempting to introduce injection vulnerabilities

[21:42:42] <technomancy> he mentions racket briefly at the bottom but I'm surprised he didn't go into more detail
[21:43:01] <pushcx> I said it a lot more politely in a comment, but I agree, this static/dynamic article borders on trolling. Like... yeah, if you delierately misunderstand a well-established term it results in confusion. So maybe don't do that.
[21:47:48] <drakonis> the cl community is rough.
[21:47:58] <mockturtle> AWS is Not a Dumb Pipe [rant] (mattr) https://lobste.rs/s/yprzex
[21:48:19] <ngoldbaum> it’s interesting sometimes watching articles pass through the recurse center writing review channel on their zulip out into the real world and see people’s reactions
[21:48:38] <ngoldbaum> pretty often things that go through that channel end up on HN and lobste.rs
[21:49:05] <jj5> on the other hand, challenging the status quo is how progress is made...
[21:49:43] <bradfier> If I have a static site served by Nginx but then I also have a process that updates those files based on some stimuli is it still a static site?
[21:49:48] <drakonis> technomancy: i'm looking forward to r7rs-large releasing within my lifetime and make scheme bigger than cl
[21:50:24] <technomancy> you'll have to wait for r15rs for that
[21:50:26] <jj5> and why does the Nginx and Apache software get ignored whereas the WordPress software is called "dynamic"
[21:50:47] <jj5> you still need to deploy and update Nginx, Apache, etc.
[21:50:49] <bradfier> Make FastCGI Great Again
[21:50:57] <drakonis> ha
[21:51:01] <bradfier> (Sorry make X jokes are a bit stale)
[21:51:12] <companion_cube> not sure what progress that helps, jj5
[21:51:42] <technomancy> jj5: that's like a 3-line cron job tho
[21:51:54] <jj5> companion_cube: I just think there's something enlightened about realising that what we call "static" and what we call "dynamic" are actually pretty arbitrary
[21:52:16] <technomancy> oh yeah? well. .. all words are arbitrary, so there =D
[21:52:27] <drakonis> i kinda want a scheme implementation that exposes its internal machinery like sbcl does
[21:52:33] <drakonis> maybe guile is the one?
[21:52:34] <companion_cube> I mean, static is the stuff that can be served from `python -m http.server`
[21:52:37] <companion_cube> even locally
[21:52:44] <drakonis> although it has way too much stuff written in C
[21:52:47] <companion_cube> it's definitely a lot simpler than the whole dynamic stuff
[21:52:50] * ngoldbaum teaches his toddler that teddy bears are called “firetruck”
[21:52:53] <companion_cube> stuffy stuff

[21:55:09] <pe> But for that, you'll need to find a few people stupid enough to invest in infra.
[21:56:12] <pe> I don't think FastCGI was ever particularly good.
[21:56:39] <pe> Most of the specification is unused in practice.
[21:58:51] <technomancy> static is when all the code you run comes from apt and dynamic is when it comes from git; hope that helps.
[21:59:12] <companion_cube> :D
[21:59:16] <companion_cube> the mystery is solved
[21:59:26] <companion_cube> static is when types make sense, dynamic is when they don't
[21:59:31] <companion_cube> do I have this right?
[21:59:40] <technomancy> close enough for this dynamic programmer
[22:00:05] <jj5> technomancy: brilliant!

[22:29:43] <jj5> IE at the time had built-in support for NTLM authentication which was pretty handy on our corporate network
[22:29:52] <wink> no idea who did that crime but it was... interesting
[22:30:37] <jj5> I loved hacking on ASP websites using JavaScript instead of VBS. A lot of people didn't realise you could (and still can) do that. Node.js eat your heart out.

[23:15:04] <Xe> hi
[23:15:25] <jj5> Xe: hi! :)
[23:18:06] <jj5> I had this weird problem today on my workstation where if I tried to umount a ZFS snapshot the process would hang in 'uninteruptable sleep', I had to reboot and after I did the problem went away... just another one of life's mysteries...
[23:21:17] <banna> how to umount: reboot?

[23:22:01] *** Joins: pwarren (~pwarren@user/pwarren)
[23:22:31] <jj5> banna: just if I tried to umount a .zfs/snapshot/whatever or even if I tried to `ls` it, the process would hang in state 'D', which meant I couldn't kill it so I had to reboot
[23:22:50] <pe> That brings back ZFS on Linux flashbacks.
[23:23:02] <pe> So it's still broken, then.
[23:23:11] <jj5> so I had that problem today, but only learned about state 'D' and related over here on #lobsters the day before
[23:23:29] <jj5> pe: it's good, but it's not the last word in file systems :P
[23:23:47] <jj5> my experience is that it's a little buggy
[23:24:11] <pe> That has always been my experience with ZFS on Linux.
[23:24:26] <pe> I converted to btrfs a few years ago.
[23:24:41] <pe> btrfs doesn't have such failures.
[23:25:13] <pe> (Very limited use on a desktop system, needed snapshots for databases.)
[23:25:17] <jj5> it's supposed to be able to autodetect your disks and reassemble volumes/file-systems (I'm a bit weak on the terminology) but my experience was if I lost my cache file I was hosed and had to recreate my pools
[23:26:34] <jj5> I did successfully replace and resilver a drive in my RAID10 array on my file server though
