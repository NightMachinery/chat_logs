[02:24:07] <dpirate> There's a way to unlock a systemd-homed LUKS home directory through https?
[02:24:51] <Hello71> uh, not a standard way afaik, but you could write one
[02:25:49] <Hello71> in general i suspect there is minimal security advantage from disk encryption if you allow remote access
[02:26:30] <dpirate> I could just also just use a veracrypt container in the samba home dir.
[02:26:40] <Hello71> er, both local and remote access that is. there are realistic threat models where *only* remote access should be permitted, e.g. cloud storage
[02:26:42] <dpirate> Unless there's some problems with that
[02:27:17] <dpirate> Well there is the security that the data is encrypted at rest.
[02:27:19] <Hello71> that will probably not be very fast but is more secure against the server
[02:28:01] <dpirate> I'm not doing that on a host accessible on the internet, I would be surprised if it would be that slow over 1Gb

[06:27:36] <tent405> I would *never* add a foreign repo
[06:27:58] <tent405> I will modify and build a PKGBUILD all day tho
[06:28:07] <xnovax> you are already installing a foreign package by installing from aur

[06:28:15] <tent405> yeah, I get that.
[06:28:40] <tent405> and even in-repo packages are poorly maintained. 
[06:28:48] <achilleas> download the zfs-linux PKGBUILD and update the version, build, and hope for the best
[06:29:22] <tent405> i like that idea the best

[06:31:38] <xnovax> Sounds like you don't want to let pacman do its job. zfs-linux is from archzfs repo

[06:33:13] <xnovax> you could make your own local repo instead if you wanted to, for some reason.

I am trying to reinstall deleting everything however, when I do 'mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1' to create a filesystem deleting everything..... Once I mount all content is always there. It never gets deleted.

[18:20:57] <aod> any ideas?

[18:21:28] <MacGyver> aod: You want an FPS game to *compile*?
[18:21:35] <MacGyver> aod: To stress-test something, or what?
[18:22:05] <aod> i did find sauterbraten motor engine but it is to heavy
[18:22:34] <jmariondev> aren't the old id games open-source now?
[18:22:55] <MacGyver> I've got at least one candidate to suggest in mind but I still don't understand the question.
[18:23:05] <MacGyver> So don't know whether my suggestion fits the bill.

[22:45:41] <tsal> Hey, I'm having a bit of trouble with the "superslicer" package I installed from AUR. When I try to launch it I get: "superslicer: error while loading shared libraries: libCGAL.so.13: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
[22:46:10] <tsal> It used to work, and nobody is complaining in the comments of the AUR package so I'm suspecting the problem is somewhere on my side
[22:46:37] <MrElendig> rebuild everything
[22:46:37] <Namarrgon> !wtf libCGAL.so
[22:46:38] <phrik> Namarrgon: What the hell is libCGAL.so?
[22:46:39] <tsal> Tried to search pacman like this: "pacman -F libCGAL.so.13" but no results
[22:46:54] <MrElendig> plocate libCGAL.so

[22:48:13] <tsal> trying the rebuild now, one moment
[22:48:51] <MrElendig> my guess would be that you updated whatever package provides that lib
[22:49:53] *** Joins: bitdex (~bitdex@gateway/tor-sasl/bitdex)
[22:50:41] <tsal> Possible. I searched the whole rootfs for "*CGAL*.so", but no results.
[22:50:59] <MrElendig> hmm, cgal package doesn't provide any .so anymore
[22:51:00] <tsal> So if it existed at one point it is gone somehow...
[22:51:39] <MrElendig> (if it ever did)
[22:52:36] <demonicmaniac1> it did
[22:52:54] <demonicmaniac1> gotta rebuild stuff that linked against it dynamically
[22:52:55] <MrElendig> time to !bug it possibly
[22:53:11] <MrElendig> unless it was upstream that got rid of it

[22:55:29] <tsal> Yep, rebuild fixed it!
[22:55:36] <tsal> Thanks!

[23:39:42] <kamaris> Can anyone provide assistance on what I'm missing when doing a system upgrade (ChimeraOS) that is resulting in the wrong kernel loading, identical to this issue: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=251089

[23:40:20] <kamaris> As far as I can tell though, the /boot partition is loaded when I'm doing the upgrade, yet on reboot, the kernel loaded (uname -r) is different than what the system installed (pacman -Q linux)
