[01:09:03] <TXDillo> Austin Energy is usually really clean and stable, but stuff happens as we found out last February
[01:09:43] <morlog> yeah
[01:10:03] <TXDillo> My workstation has a pure sine wave UPS that conditions the power to the rig
[01:12:03] <TXDillo> May have to test to see how long the power bank could keep the rig going
[01:12:13] <morlog> well
[01:12:25] <TXDillo> just for yuks
[01:12:33] <morlog> do you know the power draw of your setup
[01:16:05] <TXDillo> not offhand
[01:17:25] <TXDillo> just disconnected the UPS from the wall socket and plugged it into the power bank, but can't get it into AC mode
[01:17:32] <TXDillo> must be too much of a draw
[01:17:55] <morlog> must be
[01:21:37] <TXDillo> I was holding the button too long
[01:21:53] <TXDillo> It goes into AC mode, but then quits
[01:22:07] <TXDillo> so yeah probably too big of a draw
[01:22:17] <TXDillo> interesting to try though
[01:23:39] <morlog> yeah
[01:23:58] <morlog> it may power your computer without the ups
[01:24:26] <LibertyDillo> Yeah, a computer or two probably
[01:25:00] <LibertyDillo> but a Mac Pro with a bunch of keyboards and audio gear apparently not
[01:25:29] <LibertyDillo> the main thing is that it's been tested to run my best lappy for 6 hours
[01:25:38] <LibertyDillo> which is what's important
[01:26:25] <LibertyDillo> and of course would power the phones for much longer if needed
[01:26:31] <LibertyDillo> great little box
[01:31:25] <morlog> if I was just using my phone the powerbank would probably last a week
[01:32:06] <morlog> 4 days with a tablet, phone, and light
[01:32:12] <morlog> heavy use
