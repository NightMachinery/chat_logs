[00:53:29] <zeraphel> i thought ed would be a better alternative to sed for something simple as 'deleting a line out of a file',  but i can't seem to figure out how i'd pass instructions to it.  Is it purely for interactive use?

[01:39:17] <greybot> You can not do: cmd < file > file. Use a tmp file (see man mktemp). To inplace edit, you can use ed. GNU sed -i can hide the magic, too

[01:39:41] <greycat> !sponge

[01:39:51] <earnestly> One of these factoids has that link, perhaps !inplace should include it

[01:40:43] <earnestly> smlavine: See the function above, sponge does the same thing

[01:42:19] <greycat> !editing
[01:42:19] <greybot> In-place "editing" of files from a script is a really poorly thought-out idea. See <http://backreference.org/2011/01/29/in-place-editing-of-files/> and <sed-i> and <pf 13> and <faq 21>.
[01:43:21] <earnestly> Could be better thought out in a non-script?
[01:43:51] <earnestly> Probably fancy use of mmap
[01:44:25] <greycat> Ideally you want to redesign whatever the hell you are doing so that a dumb script is NOT editing a file that was designed only to be edited by a human-level intelligence.  Perhaps by replacing the config file with a series of smaller files that can be unlinked or overwritten separately.

[20:37:30] <heiner> fling: it is fast, but counts sub-directories (in fact every directory entry) as 1 file

[23:50:32] <dfdx> Hi #bash, is it safe to edit /etc/DIR_COLORS directly or is there a more proper way?
[23:51:29] <twkm> for a personal system it should be fine.
[23:51:45] <geirha> I assume it contains config in the format GNU  dircolors -p  outputs?
[23:51:48] <twkm> for a multiuser system it might be annoying.
[23:54:07] <dfdx> geirha: correct
[23:54:09] <dfdx> single personal system
[23:54:15] <dfdx> okay, i just wanted to make sure.
[23:54:23] <dfdx> thanks.
[23:54:43] <greycat> I have no such file, and I am thankful to Debian for this.

[23:55:17] <dfdx> I have it in Gentoo. I was just trying to figure out how/where LS_COLORS was defined
[23:55:32] <geirha> to compensate, debian makes sure you can't opt out of bash-completion, by sourcing it from /etc/profile
[23:55:40] <greycat> probably by running dircolors in your login profile
[23:56:00] <greycat> geirha: mine doesn't
[23:56:14] <geirha> your .bashrc probably has eval "$(dircolros /etc/DIR_COLORS)"
[23:56:16] <greycat> /etc/profile.d/* maybe
[23:56:26] <geirha> yes, in the .d dir
[23:57:12] <greycat> I guess I never noticed because I do almost all of my work in X terminal emulators that don't run login shells
[23:57:52] <dfdx> I don't have anything in my .bashrc or .bash_profile that sources DIR_COLORS, that's why I was confused.
[23:57:54] <geirha> yeah, mainly ssh logins you notice it on
[23:58:25] <geirha> PS4='+ $BASH_SOURCE;$LINENO:' bash -xlic '' 2>&1 | grep dircolors
[23:58:28] <jmcantrell> Can someone help me understand what's happening with the redirection here: https://bitbucket.org/raymonad/xss-lock/src/1e158fb20108058dbd62bd51d8e8c003c0a48717/doc/transfer-sleep-lock-i3lock.sh#lines-37
[23:58:41] <geirha> dfdx: that should tell you were it gets used
[23:58:53] <twkm> you know what line but you couldn't paste just it here.  hmm.
