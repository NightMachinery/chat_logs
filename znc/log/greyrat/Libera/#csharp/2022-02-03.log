[01:44:58] <DevJohnC> s opps
[01:45:17] <DevJohnC> it's all compiler sugar, why doesn't it compile to (if not null) do assignment
[01:45:41] <Suchiman> because it's not defined to work that way currently :P
[01:45:52] <DevJohnC> thus my question: why not
[01:45:53] <Suchiman> due to it being defined working the way i described xD

[03:02:50] <Ownix> I have this CSProj, I want to build a self contained single file exe for windows and linux. However I get this error when calling dotnet publish "It is not supported to build or publish a self-contained application without specifying a RuntimeIdentifier" https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/uQvOYJAP/exe%20csproj
[03:03:24] <Ownix> The error makes no sense as I clearly have RuntimeIdentifiers set. Also this WORKS If I use a singular <RuntimeIdentifier>win-64</...> OR linux-64
[03:03:32] <Ownix> It refuses to work when I want both.
[03:06:42] <BtbN> It's embedding potential native dependencies. So you got to pick, or select the universal one, and it'll produce a directory tree with all the stuff it has in it
[03:06:55] *** Joins: alguien (~alguien@user/alguien)
[03:07:40] <Ownix> BtbN: Universal??
[03:08:08] <BtbN> Or Portable or whatever it calls it
[03:08:33] <Ownix> BtbN: by universal, or portable, you mean not self contained? IE framework dependent?
[03:08:39] <Ownix> Or, do you mean not single-file?
[03:08:53] <BtbN> You can't do single file and bundle EVERYTHING
[03:09:07] <Ownix> BtbN: But why wont it just create folders for linux and windows?
[03:09:09] <Ownix> That makes no sense
[03:09:15] <BtbN> Yes it does?
[03:09:32] <Ownix> But my example does not work... it works fine if I do them individually
[03:09:47] <Ownix> `<RuntimeIdentifiers>win-x64;linux-x64</RuntimeIdentifiers>` VS `<RuntimeIdentifier>linux-x64</RuntimeIdentifier>`
[03:10:06] <BtbN> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/single-file
[03:12:25] <BtbN> If you do single file, you pick one specific OS for that single file to run on.
[03:12:45] <Ownix> BtbN: Okay, so in my CICD  I have to essentially publish twice and specify the RID if I want this to work
[03:12:54] <BtbN> Specially if you do stand-alone. a framework-dependent windows .exe _might_ work on Linux, but it's not a guarantee
[03:12:59] <Ownix> Because a single publish to multiple RIDs at once is simply not supported
[03:13:36] <Ownix> At the end of the day I just want an EXE and a Linux file, no dotnet runtime install required, and a single file for deployment
[03:14:03] <BtbN> You can't have "a single file for deployment" if you want it to be framework-independent
[03:14:15] <BtbN> Linux has no idea how to run a Windows .exe, and vice versa Windows no idea how to run an elf binary
[03:14:40] <BtbN> A framework dependent exe you can often run on Linux manually via dotnet
[03:15:10] <BtbN> But by far not always. If it has native dependencies, it won't work
[03:15:56] <Ownix> Ah so: `dotnet publish -r linux-x64 -p:PublishSingleFile=true --self-contained true` is straight up not possible?
[03:16:16] <Ownix> It worked and created a linux file, but I have no tested it
[03:16:34] <brianonymous> lol, what in the actual fuck is this -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ite2vY5qihc
[03:17:06] <brianonymous> am i really getting to be 'that old guy', this shit is awful, lol
[03:17:44] <BtbN> It's possible, but it will then _only_ work on Linux
[03:18:02] <BtbN> if you're fine with having two single-files, one for Windows and one for Linux, that's just what you want
[03:18:15] <Ownix> yeah BtbN thats what I have wanted all along
[03:18:16] <BtbN> but you cannot have one single file that runs on both _and_ is framework independent
[03:19:34] <Ownix> right

[06:45:55] <_genuser_> hey devs
[06:52:33] <teegee> Code I want to run when my WPF app is closing down. Overwrite OnExit or do it in the Exit event handler?
[06:55:02] <_genuser_> teegee https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20346746/how-to-use-application-exit-event-in-wpf
[06:55:08] <_genuser_> Application.Exit
[06:56:26] <teegee> I have read that exact post before I asked. I felt that it only addressed the question HOW to use the Exit event from xaml but not if it's better than overwriting OnExit
[06:57:51] <teegee> so I guess you're saying, use the event
[06:58:07] <_genuser_> teegee OnExit is in the Window, no?
[06:58:22] <_genuser_> are you thinking of overwriting the Main window's OnExit?
[06:58:50] <teegee> no, the Applicaion's. In App.xaml.cs
[06:59:38] <_genuser_> Ah, I see in the public class APP override OnExit.
[06:59:47] <_genuser_> I'd probably think they're the same.... (could be wrong).
[07:00:09] <_genuser_> I'd imagine the event handler added in xaml side probably just gets run around this OnExit.
[07:00:16] <teegee> well.. App.OnExit raises the Exit event
[07:00:44] <_genuser_> so I don't have a technical answer. I'd probably just go with App.OnExit if you've got a bunch of start up code in App class anyway. keep everything in the same place.
[07:00:47] <teegee> so, it's a question where you want your code to run. before or after or during the Exit event
[07:03:04] <_genuser_> choices choices.
[07:04:43] <_genuser_> App is just extending Application? public class App : Application?
[07:05:27] <teegee> yep
[07:06:18] <_genuser_> then I wonder when you do in code with override or provide via xaml (which is also in the Application tag) I wonder if they're both providing the same method to be run just in different ways.
[07:06:28] <_genuser_> I'd have to start a wpf project to verify.

[08:34:15] <teegee> _genuser_: Using the Exit property in xaml and subscribing to the Exit even in code-behind is the same. Overwriting OnExit is obviously a code-only thing

[14:10:48] <Nasp> Yes
[14:10:58] <JakeSays> that's crazy

[14:11:35] <Nasp> But you can submit request to get more names approved
[14:11:54] <JakeSays> i find it crazy that naming would even be legislated.
[14:12:00] <Nasp> Because everyone wants their kid to have a unique name
[14:12:18] <Nasp> Well then crazy parents can give kids too crazy names i assume
[14:12:31] <Nasp> Also if you don't give your kid a nam after x months, the gov will decide

[14:13:57] <JakeSays> i would think so
[14:14:04] <Bilz> hi. ive been charged with refactoring some old code. there are a bunch of "static extern int MethodName" methods, but they have no attributes to them. Is there a default attribute or something??
[14:14:14] <Bilz> for the DllImport*
[14:14:26] <Nasp> The most annoying thing is when people wants to give their kid a special name
[14:14:38] <Nasp> But instead of special they decide to either go all out crazy
[14:14:40] <JakeSays> Nasp: so now they'll add a list of names that can't be used by males or females
[14:14:44] <Nasp> Or an existing name with an alternative spelling
[14:14:54] <Nasp> So you just know each time that kid have to give up their name, they will have to spell it

[15:43:27] <Nasp> Automate what?

[15:43:49] <Nasp> You scan the card when exiting the station
[15:43:50] <JakeSays> i know. find a way.
[15:44:15] <JakeSays> biberu: we have a similar system here, but if you don't check out they just charge you for a day's travel
[15:44:19] <Nasp> They will come with an app "soon"
[15:44:31] <Nasp> Maybe if i in that could checkin and then set it to expire at a predefined station
[15:44:47] <Nasp> JakeSays: Yeah here you are charged lots for traveling
[15:44:57] <Nasp> Would be nice if it was just for a day or something like it
[15:45:04] <biberu> JakeSays: at least better than banning you from the service, preventing people from traveling is bad for everyone
[15:45:24] <JakeSays> last time i used mass transit it was like $12/day if you didn't have a subscription
[15:45:25] <Nasp> Just getting groceries on the way home costs like 4 dollars more
[15:45:32] <JakeSays> biberu: exactly
[15:45:38] <Nasp> Due to the small detour / delay
[15:46:28] <JakeSays> if you pay the full fair you can travel for 24 hours all you want
[15:46:54] <biberu> i don't have to check out with any of my cards here, train, bus, subway are all just when entering
[15:47:08] <Nasp> JakeSays: You can only travel for 1 hour
[15:47:14] <Nasp> And only a fixed number of stations
[15:47:54] <JakeSays> biberu: yeah on buses here you pay when you get off, so if you dont have a card you just pay for the route
[15:48:10] <JakeSays> well, depends on the direction actually
[15:48:27] <Nasp> I also sometimes forget it in busses
[15:48:35] <Nasp> Then yo uhave to wait for the next one hop in, pay and go out
[15:48:41] <biberu> lolwut
[15:48:53] <JakeSays> biberu: but yeah if i had a subscription i would only need to show the card when asked
[15:48:56] <biberu> who designed that Nasp :D
[15:49:00] <Nasp> biberu:  Gov
[15:49:33] <biberu> and they hired kindergarteners for it?
[15:50:18] <Nasp> At least it's "easier" than before when you had to remember this https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/sites/visitcopenhagen.com/files/2019-06/zonekort_movia.jpg
[15:50:32] <Nasp> It's a 15-20 distance area and there's over 100 zones
[15:50:38] <JakeSays> Nasp: LOL holy shit
[15:50:55] <Nasp> Also some stations were in the middle of zones and nobody knew which zones it were so you just got a fine usually
[15:51:04] <Nasp> JakeSays:  PRoblem was that system got implemented digitally
[15:51:13] <Nasp> They were supposed to simplify it, but didnt due to some reason
[15:51:28] <biberu> even if the designer just wants to give a huge fuck you to all the nasps having to wait for more buses so that they'll be allowed to keep using public transportation that's time they can't e.g. work or otherwise be productive members of society, that doesn't seem to be in the best interest of "Gov"
[15:51:30] <Nasp> So the zones are still like that
[15:51:49] <JakeSays> there are 3x as many people here and our system is no where near that complicated
[15:51:52] *** Joins: Roughy (~mdaw45ns@user/roughy)
[15:51:52] <Nasp> biberu:  Well they have an app now i just tried to use where you on the honor system can say "I hopped off the bus here"
[15:52:09] <Nasp> Also if you take route A to B
[15:52:15] <Nasp> And the number of zones are 4
[15:52:23] <biberu> we don't even have an app for that
[15:52:24] <Nasp> Then maybe on the way back it could be 4-6 for various reasons
[15:52:27] <Nasp> If you didn't know that = fine
[15:52:55] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Why do you think more and more people still buy cars :D
[15:52:57] <biberu> on honor we buy the ticket we should, get on, get off
[15:53:00] <Nasp> nobody wants to deal with that shit
[15:53:06] <Nasp> Even though public transport is good, it's just fuckign expensive
[15:53:19] <JakeSays> we buy cars here because walking sucks
[15:53:22] <Nasp> biberu:  You can't buy tickets anymore
[15:53:43] <Nasp> Like i said getting groceries on my way home delays me getting home
[15:53:45] <Nasp> So i need to pay more
[15:53:55] <Nasp> Because it's both distance (zones) and time
[15:54:04] <Nasp> And the time duration is very small
[15:54:20] <Nasp> Usually an hour
[15:54:20] <JakeSays> note to self: don't live in denmark
[15:54:36] <Nasp> So if you take a trip somewhere and take the same train back in 1 hour
[15:54:41] <Nasp> You need a new ticket
[15:56:09] <Nasp> Also those cards expire very 5 years and you need to buy a new one for 10 dollars
[15:56:14] <biberu> my commuting card is valid for buses and subway in the two cities i'm traveling between, and i think 3 different train operators, all i have to do is get on board
[15:56:21] <Nasp> The company says they lose money on that because they buy the cards from someone else
[15:56:26] <Nasp> That's gotta be good business
[15:56:36] <Nasp> 10 dollars for a card
[15:56:49] <Nasp> biberu:  Well so are mine
[15:57:02] <Nasp> It works between all operators
[15:57:14] <Nasp> You just need to remember to swipe the card each time you enter
[15:57:18] <Nasp> And then when you stop your travel
[15:57:22] <Nasp>  Which i always forget
[15:57:49] <Nasp> So it's more complicated than before, when you had a tickets you didnt need to do anything each time you took a new train or bus
[15:57:53] <Nasp> And when exiting
[15:57:59] <biberu> why do you have to swipe at all?

[20:55:31] <jonp> hi
[20:56:13] <TomyWork> when logging a stack trace, is there any way to log the line numbers (or something I can derive the line numbers from) as well, without providing the user with a full .pdb file?
[20:57:28] <TomyWork> the runtime probably doesn't know the line numbers without a .pdb, but it would know the bytecode offset to the beginning of the function, right?
[21:00:13] <jonp> bytecode offset can't be correlated with filename or line number w/o a .pdb
[21:00:14] <MatthiasVance> TomyWork: There are tools that collect a dump (and send it) that you can then analyze, instead of logging a stack trace

[21:09:00] <MatthiasVance> Okay, so if you can get a dump .. and you can get the PDB internally .. you can debug it :P
[21:09:25] <guideX> so I'm working with some, old horrible vb.net code, and it says blah = New EmailMessage("webmail.blah.com") and that gives me "URI formats are not supported" for some reason, any ideas?
[21:09:42] <MatthiasVance> Not sure if your customers are up for that TomyWork, they can also contain sensitive information
[21:09:44] <TomyWork> it's a restricted execution environment. no chance to get any extra heap dump tools working there
[21:09:51] <MatthiasVance> Task manager?
[21:09:54] <Suchiman> ^ if you can get the pdb internally and are working like per remote desktop on the customer's PC, you only need the pdb for the assembly / project that is encountering the problem, just drop it in next to it, reproduce error, get line numbers, delete again
[21:10:14] <MatthiasVance> TomyWork: Task manager works fine for that purpose. Right click process -> Create dump file
[21:10:15] <TomyWork> oh, right-click => debug and hunt for the core dump?
[21:10:26] <MatthiasVance> It will tell you the location iirc
[21:10:36] <TomyWork> it's a separate item now? interesting
[21:10:41] <Suchiman> yeah, Create dump file will write the dump file to %TMP%
[21:11:31] <TomyWork> problem is that i'd have to do that at the exact nanosecond the exception is thrown :)

[21:13:04] <MatthiasVance> what!
[21:15:01] <Guest95>  I have an issue that I have not been able to solve. My program takes cmdline args, and will either take a file location or text of some sort as a string. in the case of a file, it works as intended and will begin to read bytes from the file. however when text is pass, instead of reading from it as though it were a stream (created from
[21:15:02] <Guest95> Console.OpenStandardOutput()), when .Read is called upon the stream object, it will create an exception saying the stream does not support reading.  https://paste.myst.rs/fpf2nxr0
[21:16:36] <TomyWork> https://stackoverflow.com/a/1328915 hmm, how's this?
[21:18:06] <jonp> Guest95: not sure i understand what you want to happen
[21:18:15] <biberu> Guest95: why are you reading from your own output?
[21:18:19] <jonp> if the user does `your-app "this is not a file"`
[21:18:21] <TomyWork> actually, is there anything you can do with the pdb that you can't do with just the binary, other than getting line numbers?
[21:18:22] <jonp> what is the expectation?
[21:18:34] <Guest95> yes, I just realized; it should have been OpenStandardInput
[21:18:44] <jonp> but why are you reading stdin?
[21:19:08] <Guest95> so that the parameter, if not a file, can be treated as a stream to be used without error
[21:19:09] <jonp> i don't understand the desired semantics
[21:19:23] <jonp> what do you mean "treat [the parameter] as a stream"?
[21:19:24] <MatthiasVance> TomyWork: So why don't the devs fix the issues?
[21:19:24] <TomyWork> I've used dotpeek (on our own binaries, of course!) and it's basically the full source anyway, so what reason could one possibly have to not just ship it with the application?
[21:19:40] <jonp> Guest95: provide the *parameter contents* as the contents of the Stream?
[21:19:47] <Guest95> yes
[21:20:31] <TomyWork> the reason i got from the devs was "it's not best practice"
[21:20:41] <jonp> Guest95: then you'd want e.g. `MemoryStream`
[21:20:45] <MatthiasVance> No I mean, fix the actual issues your customers are having TomyWork
[21:21:04] <jonp> Guest95: `return new MemoryStream(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(args[0]));`

[21:40:37] <abirtx> Hello, what should I start learning after C# basics ? Should I start learning networking in c# or what ?
[21:40:42] <MatthiasVance> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/j3xF3d7z/image.png
[21:40:50] <MatthiasVance> abirtx: What is your goal?
[21:40:59] <xb0o2> Jesus christ, just got to 29:43 on vampire survivors and died
[21:41:09] <xb0o2> Rip
[21:41:38] <MatthiasVance> xb0o2: Say what now? :D
[21:41:50] <MatthiasVance> And can I assume after 30 minutes you have .. survived?
[21:41:55] <MatthiasVance> Or rather, won?
[21:42:02] <xb0o2> Well, you die, but yeah
[21:42:06] <abirtx> I am interestd in desktop app development but not sure yet as I am in 2nd year of my CS degree
[21:42:48] <xb0o2> It's like a $3 retro bullet hell survival game, well worth the very reasonable price ^^
[21:42:53] <edcba> well do you need a connected desktop app ?
[21:44:07] <abirtx> Yeah I am interested in making such app which can talk to each other
[21:45:07] <xb0o2> abirtx: Can you think of any software that would actually be useful to you? That you can then work on?
[21:45:52] <abirtx> Ummm, sorry but nothing coming to my thinking now :-)
[21:46:10] <MatthiasVance> abirtx: Have you looked at the "Head First C#" book?
[21:47:03] <abirtx> Ow No I haven't heard about that book yet actually. Should I start reading it ?
[21:47:50] <xb0o2> abirtx: https://github.com/karan/Projects#networking might have some ideas.
[21:48:09] <MatthiasVance> Holy shit they are using Unity now
[21:48:13] <MatthiasVance> abirtx: Definitely check it out!
[21:48:14] <abirtx> I mean I am willing to know that will it be ok if I start learning C# networking or I am missing something that I should start before starting networking stuffs
[21:48:30] <abirtx> Ok Thanks man. I will check it out then
[21:48:30] <MatthiasVance> abirtx: You know how often I use plain networking in my job? 0 times
[21:48:55] <MatthiasVance> abirtx: You want to know how often I have used plain networking in my job the last 13 years? 0 times
[21:49:00] <MatthiasVance> BUT
[21:49:05] <abirtx> What !! Really ? I thought networking was a major demand in jobs
[21:49:11] <MatthiasVance> I said BUT
[21:49:13] <edcba> yeah there is a big BUT
[21:49:22] <MatthiasVance> You do have to know how it all works :D
[21:49:29] <abirtx> Thanks for the link @MattiasVance
[21:49:38] <MatthiasVance> That was xb0o2
[21:50:08] <xb0o2> An intermediate understanding of how networking works, how common internet protocols work etc. can be super helpful
[21:50:16] <xb0o2> Without needing to write an implementation
[21:50:44] <edcba> yeah wrting your own IRC/SMTP/POP/... client is nice to learn

[21:52:00] <brianonymous> an irc client was one of my first ever windows apps
[21:52:11] <MatthiasVance> The new Head First C# book is pretty cool, touches Unity and WebAssembly as well
[21:52:18] <xb0o2> I wouldn't get hung up on a particular thing or project to work on though - you're better off chasing whatever random thing you find interesting
[21:52:43] <abirtx> Ow ok i understand. Though I know some networking stuffs which I learned while learning C++. But I don't know enoguh so I guess I should start now
[21:52:45] <edcba> yeah just have fun coding, you'll learn eventually
[21:52:49] <xb0o2> At least until you've got a reasonable enough knowledge base to say "ok, I'd love to write an x with y features"
[21:53:11] <MatthiasVance> xb0o2: Doing it that way might also give you focus on what to search for / learn next though
[21:53:30] <xb0o2> abirtx: on a slight tangent, you say you're doing a degree, they've introduced you to a VCS yeah?
[21:53:43] <MatthiasVance> :D
[21:54:00] <xb0o2> Because getting the basics of a VCS locked down is 100% the first thing I'd suggest you look at :)
[21:54:06] <edcba> vcs the tv recording machine you mean ? :)
[21:54:12] <edcba> yes they did :p
[21:54:24] <MatthiasVance> Good point
[21:54:30] <MatthiasVance> *Great
[21:54:32] <MatthiasVance> *Amazing
[21:55:06] <abirtx> I was a C++ lover but as I am learning C# I am starting to like it as it is very much easy to make desktop apps and it dominates windows platform
[21:55:37] <MatthiasVance> abirtx: If you are doing your own projects, make sure you use .NET 6
[21:55:41] <edcba> soon dominating linux web services !
[21:56:37] <abirtx> @MathiasVance yeah I am using dotnet 6
[21:57:05] <abirtx> @edcba really !! Using asp.net or what ?
[21:57:34] <edcba> no not really
[21:57:45] <DevJohnC> does anybody else ever get a sense of claustraphobia in a code file/type that feels like it's sprawling out of control?
[21:57:45] <MatthiasVance> What do you mean not really
[21:57:48] <edcba> linux ppl will prefer go i think
[21:57:53] <MatthiasVance> DevJohnC: I use F#, not a problem there :D
[21:58:09] <xb0o2> I think they're being a bit hyperbolic but .NET 6 is perfectly good for writing web services on whatever platform you fancy :0
[21:58:24] <MatthiasVance> abirtx: Yes you can run on Linux / Mac / mobile just fine with .NET
[21:58:28] <xb0o2> DevJohnC: how many kLoC does something have to be before you reach that point?
[21:58:52] <edcba> but .net is quite nice to dev with
[21:59:01] <DevJohnC> my model has 20 members and it's making me feel weird
[21:59:11] <DevJohnC> like, actual claustraphobia each time I add a new member
[21:59:45] <xb0o2> Seems a bit excessive but I wouldn't be running for the hills
[21:59:50] <abirtx> The thing with dotnet core and dotnet 6 makes me confused. Which should I learn ?
[22:00:00] <edcba> 6
[22:00:26] <xb0o2> Ignore .NET Core now, it's old news
[22:00:29] <xb0o2> You want to use .NET 6
[22:00:42] <edcba> genius guys at ms naming dept...
[22:01:09] <edcba> soon we will have .net 11 so it can match windows version
[22:01:26] <abirtx> haha ! You are right @edcba their naming is awesome
[22:01:40] <xb0o2> For the stuff you'll be learning and working on, I think that's literally the only version you're going to be interested in
[22:02:30] <abirtx> Okay so I will totally ignore .net core @xb0o2
[22:02:58] <edcba> yeah just learn asp.net core classic framework 6 !
[22:03:12] <edcba> jk
[22:04:09] <xb0o2> Only caveat to that might be if you do start messing around with Unity. I have no idea what it currently supports.
[22:05:00] <abirtx> Ok so adding ASP.NET to my list. It will help me in building web service/pages right ? @edcba

[22:10:01] <MatthiasVance> Yes
[22:10:20] <abirtx> @xb0o2 sorry for late answer but nope they haven't introduced us to VCS yet. But I have personally learned it enough & I do everything using git from my linux scripting to general coding
[22:10:30] <MatthiasVance> abirtx: very good! :D
[22:10:32] <xb0o2> git's a great choice.
[22:11:22] <_genuser_> abirtx you're in for a surprise when you learn visual source safe.
[22:11:27] <_genuser_> you will never go back.
[22:11:39] <MatthiasVance> lol what
[22:12:11] <_genuser_> just a little thursday fun. I figured let him at least google and figure out it's a good joke.
[22:12:11] <abirtx> Yep, thanks bro. I love git. IDK why the dept teachers didn't introduced git to their students yet. It's something that they should have told us in the first semester I think
[22:12:19] <DevJohnC> MatthiasVance, well I wanna refactor the object if that's what you mean :P
[22:12:27] <DevJohnC> I think part of the issue is this system only has one screen
[22:12:30] <DevJohnC> I feel so confined!
[22:12:42] <MatthiasVance> DevJohnC: A screen can still be made up by different components
[22:12:42] <abirtx> @_genuser_ Visual Source Safe ??? What's that !
[22:12:50] <MatthiasVance> abirtx: No no no no, they are joking
[22:13:04] <_genuser_> abirtx if you're a CS student, you'll find two types of classes - programming/language-introduction class. and software engineering/developing/cs-theory classes.
[22:13:25] <_genuser_> abirtx so if a teacher gets into teaching for loops and other programming concepts AND introduces VCS it will be a major headache for them.
[22:13:45] <_genuser_> abirtx visual source safe is a really old source control system by microsoft. 20-25yo. It was a joke.
[22:13:53] <abirtx> Ow thanks for letting me know @MathiasVance. They got me xD
[22:14:03] <MatthiasVance> abirtx: Type a few letters of someone's name and press <TAB>
[22:14:23] <_genuser_> oh yeah the instagram generation is so used to doing @nick
[22:14:38] <MatthiasVance> Technically that still works if only you complete it then ;p
[22:14:44] <GunArm> abirtx: i had the same thought coming out of school and getting a job.  that they didn't introduce me to version control was a war crime
[22:16:00] <GunArm> not just because it will so clearly be needed for any job, but because I was doing projects all through college like a caveman copying folders of code into `Copy of Copy of Copy of MyProject (1) (2) (1)`
[22:16:09] <abirtx> ow man ! I was trying to figure it out from the beginning. I just installed HexChat in Windows. Always used IRSSI in linux. Didn't know how to mention in HexChat. Thanks @MatthiasVance
[22:16:29] <khanred> um, not like that
[22:16:46] <abirtx> Yeah man it really is a crime GunArm
[22:16:50] <_genuser_> you don't need the @
[22:17:01] <GunArm> I consider the lack of introduction to version control to be a abject failure and complete incopmetance at making a curriculum
[22:17:02] <MatthiasVance> Maybe he senses my op powers
[22:17:05] <MatthiasVance> xD
[22:17:06] <_genuser_> just nick or initial few letters then <TAB>
[22:17:14] <abirtx> oh ok _genuser_ but in IRSSI i needed to type @ haha
[22:17:30] <MatthiasVance> _genuser_ can't complain, they have fucking underscores
[22:17:34] <abirtx> yeah i got it _genuser_
[22:17:51] <_genuser_> abirtx probably really old version. I used irssi for year until few months ago and same thing - abi<tab> and bam autocomplete.
[22:18:06] <_genuser_> khanred o/
[22:18:10] <khanred> o/
[22:18:20] <GunArm> but unlike discord, IRC clients dont' usually highlight messages unless you put it up front
[22:18:26] <GunArm> abirtx: like this
[22:18:32] <GunArm> but not like this abirtx or @abirtx
[22:18:33] <_genuser_> MatthiasVance actually in irssi you could do gen<TAB> and it would autocomplete to _genuser_. I nsee Kiwi IRC doesn't.
[22:19:01] <MatthiasVance> _genuser_: IRCCloud does as well ;) I was just saying you already have a prefixed name so can no longer advocate for not having one :D
[22:20:08] <abirtx> _genuser_,  Yep I used it on my ubuntu server at home which is really really old. Maybe thats why I didn't get this autocompletion in IRSSI
[22:21:05] <_genuser_> MatthiasVance hehe, genuser was taken on freenode. And then improvisation!
[22:22:28] <GunArm> anyone still on freenode?  is it empty?
[22:22:38] * khanred barfs
[22:22:43] <_genuser_> I think freenode is gone now.
[22:22:57] <abirtx> I got permanent ban from freenode :)
[22:23:03] <_genuser_> so win7 keeps telling me it's out of support. I should install win10.
[22:23:19] <_genuser_> so much that I just want to move to winXP just to spite that notification!
[22:23:32] <MatthiasVance> Just tried the web client: "We couldn't log in :( There was a problem connecting :("
[22:24:26] <GunArm> wow totally gone? i figured they'd keep it running trying to hold onto hope
[22:24:42] <_genuser_> I think all the SJWs defected fast.
[22:24:48] <GunArm> and there'd be a consistent handful of people too lazy to change
