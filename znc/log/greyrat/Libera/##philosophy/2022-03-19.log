[20:56:54] <Jong> brigand  Isn't what you stated a fallacy ? It sounds like you just stated that A is sufficient for B because A is necessary for B.
[20:58:08] <brigand> it's just gibberish to me, sorry
[20:59:27] <brigand> i just wrote that out to display the absurdness of the negations

[21:03:01] <brigand> "Money brings happiness because you can't be happy without it."
[21:03:49] <I_Am_M00t> the stress of not being able to afford good food and housing brings happiness
