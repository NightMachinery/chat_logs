[00:26:57] <aquanight> pflanze: if you're going to list core modules, list them with the version as they are in the minimum supported perl distribution
[00:27:38] <aquanight> that would be my suggestion anyway
[00:28:07] <aquanight> eval: require strict; say $strict::VERSION; # f.ex
[00:28:08] <perlbot> aquanight: 1.12 
[00:29:40] <aquanight> ok I don't know why I'm now noticing this.
[00:30:01] <aquanight> apparently use Thing VERSION; doesn't call 'import'. Is there a syntax that checks VERSION *and* also calls default import?
[00:30:14] <aquanight> other than doing the equivalent BEGIN myself
[00:30:25] <mst> it does
[00:30:40] <mst> 'use strictures 2;' wouldn't work if you weren't wrong
[00:30:42] <ether> aquanight: that doesn't add any value, but can make the reader wonder why there is a specific version required and then they have to go look up whether it corresponds to that minimum core version or if it's something else

[00:38:49] <aquanight> huh that's interesting
[00:39:50] <mst> also on earlier versions of perl the auto-generated import() method if there isn't a real one does something weird (i.e. buggy) stack discipline wise and I remember you can make all sorts of 'fun' stuff happen with that
[00:40:29] <aquanight> so, note to self, perldoc sometimes contains blatant lies

[00:41:21] <aquanight> mst: I'm assuming you already found what I was reading, but just in case this was the relevant bit that made me doubt myself: https://perldoc.pl/functions/use#:~:text=If%20the%20VERSION%20argument%20is%20present%20between%20Module%20and%20LIST

[00:43:03] <aquanight> mst: ... unclear? They give a pretty straightforward example, and it is pretty straightforward wrong (in that they forgot it does also call import)
[00:43:47] <mst> it's talking about specifically the behaviour of the VERSION part of the statement - it already told you that absent () import would be called so they didn't duplicate that information - though I agree it would've been clearer if they had
[00:45:08] <aquanight> ah yeah there's a paragraph after that talks about LIST and mentions "no comma after VERSION"
[00:45:55] <aquanight> I half wonder if that example maybe was written during a brief moment when 'use' first became a thing and 'import' wasn't yet.
[00:46:10] <mst> I would definitely +1 a patch to make it clearer, but it's not 'blatant lies' per se

[00:59:27] <ether> what does your tool need to know?
[01:00:01] <ether> if you just need the module, at any old version, then don't specify a specific version for it. if it ever becomes not-core, things will keep working just fine
[01:00:52] <ether> tools that *read* prereq information, e.g. distribution package managers, know how to figure out what distribution the modules are in, and it can see that 'strict' is actually part of core perl itself and do the right thing
[01:09:59] <aquanight> ether: my point was I was assuming the start of this subject was listing module dependencies in a package manifest. E.g. for cpan
[01:10:23] <aquanight> and whether or not core modules should even be listed, or be listed with versions.
[01:11:24] <aquanight> and my answer is "if I was going to list core modules and had the option, I'd do so to tell whatever module installer that I *expect* them to be core modules". At which point, asserting the core version itself would cover everything.
[01:12:05] <Grinnz> that's not how modules work
[01:12:14] <aquanight> and since usually that's not a thing, the next best option is, if you're going to list core modules, list with the core module version as it is for the installed perl version, unless you need an updated version via cpan dual-life
[01:12:34] <Grinnz> if it's dual-life, you need to know the version so it can be updated if necessary, with nothing to do with the fact that it's core
[01:12:41] <Grinnz> if it's not, there's nothing the cpan installer can do anyway
[01:13:08] <Grinnz> just list with 0 unless you have a reason to require a certain version or higher
[01:13:09] <aquanight> Grinnz: right. In theory, for non-dual-life core modules, you rely on asserting the core distribution version.
[01:13:48] <aquanight> since that's the thing that's actionable.
[01:14:18] <aquanight> and in that case I'd probably just not list the core modules at all. I'm just saying that if I was going to list a core module, I'd do so with a version.
[01:14:32] <aquanight> and that probably means I probably already needed a particular version via dual-life update to begin with.
[01:14:35] <Grinnz> there is no guarantee that a core module will stay core, or that it won't become dual life
[01:14:37] <ether> if you depend on a particular feature of 'strict', I'd expect you to specify the version where that feature appeared. if you depend on a particular feature of perl itself, mention that version itself in the prereqs, but don't tie strict's version to perl's version
[01:15:36] <Grinnz> there are modules where it's reasonable to assume it will never be booted from core, like strict and warnings and utf8
[01:15:43] <Grinnz> and lib
[01:15:46] <ether> requiring a specific version of strict does imply a specific version of perl, since it's not dual-lifed, yes
[01:15:54] <aquanight> ether: I guess where I'm getting at is that to me it makes no sense to say "I require a perl newer than 5.22" and also "I'm okay with any version of strict.pm. Even if it's from 5.6 despite the fact that said minimum 5.22 provides a a newer strict.pm than said theoretical 5.6"
[01:15:55] <Grinnz> but not a whole lot beyond that
[01:16:13] <Grinnz> why? your perl requirement already covers the requirement for strict.pm
[01:16:14] <ether> but don't go the other way, i.e. requiring a specific version of perl resulting in specifying a specific version of strict itself
[01:16:35] <Grinnz> beyond that you're just faffing about making things more confusing for everyone for something you don't need
[01:16:37] <aquanight> Grinnz: does it though? What would stop someone from @INC'ing an older strict.pm into scope?
[01:16:46] <Grinnz> the fact that would break their entire perl
[01:16:52] <aquanight> yes
[01:17:02] <Grinnz> relying on people not breaking their perl is rather central to CPAN
[01:17:14] *** Quits: EGD (~egd@user/egd) ()
[01:17:25] <ether> it's *possible* that something non-dual-lifed could be untangled in the future and made dual-life, but we can't go back in time and do that for already-existing versions of perl or strict
[01:17:49] <aquanight> like I said. The core of it is that to me it makes no sense to imply I'm okay with things that are older than the version included with the minimum required core.
[01:18:06] <ether> you're not implying that
[01:18:09] <Grinnz> 0 is not "okay with older things" it's "i don't require a specific version beyond what's already necessary for other reasons"

[01:21:59] <Grinnz> specifically in the example of strict, it hasn't in my knowledge had a new api feature that would require caring about the version - if you want https://perldoc.perl.org/blead/feature#CHECKING-FEATURES you might want to rrequire feature 1.67 though
[01:21:59] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ feature - Perl pragma to enable new features - Perldoc Browser ]
[01:22:19] <Grinnz> the other problem with this is that core modules have no individual changelogs
[01:22:27] <Grinnz> so it's a lot of work to figure out specific versions needed
[01:22:29] <xenu> i suppose they banned requiring new modules with Safe
[01:22:33] <mst> aquanight: if it's an old carp where Carp and Carp::Heavy are split, loading Carp itself then having a 'use lib' or whatever add a directory with a Carp::Heavy from a different version can cause explosions
[01:23:10] <mst> haarg had to hit local::lib with a hammer to deal with that one at some point IIRC
[01:23:41] <aquanight> mst: looking at that commit they talk about Safe compartments which still confuses me
[01:24:06] <aquanight> because if they idea is "they can't allow 'require' in Safe" my answer to that is "why the fuck not you can just control @::INC ffs"
[01:24:37] <mst> require "./fuckyou";
[01:25:12] <aquanight> wouldn't that just run the file inside the Safe compartment anyway?
[01:26:18] <aquanight> also isn't Safe.pm considered "awful" or something at this point? Like little better than taint?
[01:26:43] <aquanight> I'll have to dig through logs to find the last time it was ever brought up in here
[01:27:08] <aquanight> but at this point I've started to assume that anything I see in perldoc that I think might actually be a good idea is as much likely to not be.
[01:27:13] <mst> that was a response to control of @INC
[01:27:27] <aquanight> ah
[01:28:02] <xenu> if you allow loading 3rd party modules you have to disable dynaloader somehow
[01:28:11] <mst> other than that, I learned enough about Safe to realise its name was not particularly accurate and then promptly forgot everything except that fact
[01:29:14] <xenu> hmm, on the second thought you don't need to load any modules to use dynaloader
[01:29:54] <xenu> it's actually a good question, loading modules should be safe if you have banned dangerous opcodes
[01:30:58] <mst> there is always the possibility that their customers kept blowing their own feet off using the ability
[01:31:07] <aquanight> hmmm

[01:31:19] <aquanight> xenu: disabling DynaLoader seems like a not-trivial thing
[01:31:31] <aquanight> it looks like you need to disable &boot_DynaLoader somehow
[01:31:37] <aquanight> I'm not sure where that lives
[01:31:45] <ether> haarg did a lot of deep diving into Safe IIRC
[01:31:48] <aquanight> it's not defined by DynaLoader.pm itself
[01:31:58] <aquanight> I'm guessing it might come from Config.pm
[01:32:11] <aquanight> nope
[01:32:18] <mst> it's in the XS code and perl autoboots it or something
[01:32:25] <xenu> it's an xsub defined directly in the interpreter
[01:32:33] <mst> I went through the relevant source bits when building my shared object fatpacking code

[03:21:44] <Grinnz> sidecar process managed by IO::Async::Function or similar isn't the worst option either
[03:22:00] <djerius> I looked at tickit, but yeah, that's more involved.  I just need a repl.
[03:25:05] <djerius> I might go that route as my async bits are poking at databases, need to see if Database::Async does what I need.

[14:43:13] <Harzilein> so i hope i'll have a slightly less faint memory now that there is rudimentary support only.
[14:44:30] <Harzilein> and for the "fails smoke testing" kind of bug i'll likely be better served by downloading the raw smoke test data.
[14:45:27] <Harzilein> reason i remembered i wanted this was being halfway through trying to make Net::IPP work and then thinking i'm maybe ridiculous.

[17:15:47] <The_Blode> I have a task that I would like to do in Perl.
[17:15:51] <shaldannon> you start looking for a new job yet?
[17:16:02] <The_Blode> Me shaldannon ?
[17:16:22] <lopid> you jane
[17:16:27] <The_Blode> I have a script that will parse TS website for results of wheel spins.
[17:16:28] <shaldannon> yeah ... last time I saw you around you were annoyed by a co-worker who was being abusive
[17:16:48] <The_Blode> After 10 consecutive spins without a one...I want Perl to notify me immediately.

[17:17:21] <Altreus> shaldannon: oh yes, I remember that too
[17:17:22] <The_Blode> It's a website that keeps track of live wheel games
[17:17:32] <shaldannon> so ... like roulette?
[17:17:34] <Altreus> A manager I think?
[17:17:35] <The_Blode> Yes I have a meeting with my line manager tomorrow about that
[17:17:42] <Altreus> oh good!
[17:17:45] <Altreus> Gotta fight for yourself
[17:18:01] <The_Blode> He lost his rag 2 Fridays ago in front of the line manager and myself.

[17:18:43] <Altreus> This is normally where malicious compliance stories start
[17:18:47] <shaldannon> (pondering if Russian roulette is a wheel game)
[17:18:49] <Altreus> anyway, roulette wheels

[17:19:03] <The_Blode> One that a person spins and it lands on a particular sector

[17:20:16] <Altreus> are you trying to gather statistics?

[17:20:24] <Altreus> sound is gonna be harder
[17:20:25] <The_Blode> The stats are already present on Tracksino
[17:20:37] <The_Blode> No, I want to place a wager only after 10 spins without 1x
[17:20:46] <Altreus> ah you want to automate the gambler's fallacy
[17:20:53] <The_Blode> Essentially, yes
[17:21:05] <Altreus> without 1x or without any x

[17:24:33] <The_Blode> The sims were running on a Pi
[17:25:01] <The_Blode> Altreus is dead right, I'm just automating the fallacy
[17:25:29] <The_Blode> The simulations revealed mixed results
[17:25:46] <The_Blode> Hypothetically, you could earn $1 per day but by wagering much more
[17:26:07] <shaldannon> so the point isn't actually to bet?
[17:26:20] <The_Blode> The simulations were just hypothetical.
[17:26:32] <The_Blode> But I'd like to place actual wagers in the 10+ scenario
[17:26:54] <The_Blode> But I don't want to sit at the game session waiting for it
[17:27:13] <shaldannon> so this is equivalent to watching someone at the slots and when they leave with zero winnings, dropping a quarter in

[23:25:16] <simcop2387> i doubled the number of datasets and made larger sparse zvols for a few things too.  i should end up with about 60-80tb free in the end, though half that on old disks in a separate pool
[23:25:20] <Grinnz> then there you go :P
[23:25:33] <mst> Grinnz: djerius' original complaint was having to type that ;)
[23:25:51] <Grinnz> ah, for some reason i read something else
[23:26:07] <mst> also though at that point you've lost plx's magic in terms of picking what <whatever> means
[23:26:57] <mst> so it does end up being noticeable extra verbosity in some cases
[23:28:49] <mst> daemon: anyway, given perl installs a perl5.28.1 or whatever binary as well, if you 'plx --init perl5.28.1' you'll get a version locked perl.spec
[23:32:52] <daemon> roger

[23:34:40] <mst> daemon: oh, also, plx --init $(perl -E 'say "perl".$^V =~ s/^v//r')
[23:35:26] <mst> daemon: though honestly if I care about the perl version I usually already know which version
[23:36:54] <djerius> some docs would probably fix 99% of it.  Mostly it was huh? why doesn't this work?  what does the code say? Aha.
[23:37:14] <djerius> I was trying PERL_RL=1 plx ....
[23:38:09] <mst> if the env var stripping isn't documented I'd love a patch
[23:38:18] * mst currently starting at the code to try and get your feature :D
