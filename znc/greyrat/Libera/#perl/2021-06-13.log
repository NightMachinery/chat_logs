[02:52:33] <simcop2387> i don't think i've ever actually seen anyone use rewinddir before.  nothing wrong with doing that it's just uncommon.  
[02:53:24] <simcop2387> i'd probably make a few changes related to that then though, that'd offer a decent speed up and cleaner code.  give me a few moments (compiling an unreleased zfs install in the background for my laptop)

[03:08:44] <simcop2387> nothing terribly complicated.  but some good things to start with and the subroutine idea is where i'd go next.

[03:09:10] <simcop2387> we've got some good books there for starting on that, i can rewrite it for you but it's not going to be difficult and it'll be a great thing to learn
[03:09:59] <Gin> Can you share some links about those books?
[03:10:28] <pflanze> I've got a very weird error, 'Undefined subroutine &FP::Abstract::Sequence::can called at ...'
[03:10:40] <pflanze> All I'm doing is:  if (defined blessed($d) and defined(my $f = $d->can("cons"))) { ... }

[03:11:23] <simcop2387> Gin: see what perlbot just said, those are the links :)
[03:11:44] <Gin> But I wonder whether you have a better understanding about the implementation of my tool.
[03:12:30] <simcop2387> pflanze: strange that it happens like that but check out Safe::Isa for dealing with the error itself.  at the worst it might help you figure out if you've got something weird going on with your objects

[03:13:56] <Gin> Actually I am thinking about creating multiple processes to extract files from sub directories.
[03:14:29] <pflanze> simcop2387, now I'm simply getting 'Undefined subroutine &FP::Abstract::Sequence::can called at /usr/share/perl5/Safe/Isa.pm line 18.' :)
[03:15:33] <simcop2387> pflanze: you've done something screwy
[03:15:59] <pflanze> I hope so (and it's not the universe falling apart). I just have no idea what. Will bisect I guess.
[03:16:47] <simcop2387> Gin: personally i'd do this with the find command on linux, but this is a good exercise for learning how to do perl still.  find /path/here -type f -regex '.*/core\.\d+' -0 | xargs -0 -P 0 rm -v
[03:17:15] <simcop2387> that'll find all files matching that regex, and give them to rm in parallel

[03:17:53] <simcop2387> it's a nice well defined problem so it makes using that problem to learn perl a very good one since you can verify that you're doing the right thing at any given step
[03:18:05] <Gin> Yep
[03:18:47] <simcop2387> what i'd probably do is make a perl function to find all the files like i said before, but use it to build up a list.  then do the unlinking after i've found all the files.  that'll result in fewer things going on at once and be easier to work on

[03:57:12] <pflanze> Hmm, that doesn't change the outcome, when using \&$glob

[04:17:02] <Grinnz> it's typeglobs, of course it is
[04:18:07] <pflanze> Someone should write the definitive article/man page/blog post about them, so you can just refer to it.
[04:18:46] <Grinnz> i don't think there is anyone with the complete sum of knowledge required

[04:20:02] <pflanze> (Otherwise I'll be horribly tempted to put it onto the FunctionalPerl blog.)
[04:21:07] <pflanze> The idea would be for people to fix it of course, so should be somewhere contributable by the relevant people.

[06:00:28] <simcop2387> pflanze: i've been slowly working on a statocles static page generator github action setup for doing this kind of thing.  right now it can properly check pull requests and publish on merges, see https://github.com/perlbot/perlbot.github.io thinking of figuring out some other things to add to it and make it more useful as a quick and useful perl documentation setup.  the best part is that since
[06:00:29] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ GitHub - perlbot/perlbot.github.io: github pages repo for perlbot ]
[06:00:34] <simcop2387> it's not using jekyll or any of github's stuff it's also not really tied to them either.  so gitlab or self hosting is also still trivial
[06:03:07] <pflanze> I wonder what other doc pages there are. Core docs: (a) are they low overhead to contribute to (Github editable, something)? (b) would the stash/glob doc be welcome there?
[06:03:40] <pflanze> But let me take a look at your link.
[06:05:35] <pflanze> Maybe your idea is useful for things where nobody takes the proper effort for something to add to core.

[06:11:26] <simcop2387> POD support is one thing i'm trying to figure out how to do with statoclese too.  it'd be super nifty to have that support in there
[06:11:50] <pflanze> docs: Ok. I'll see if I manage to get around to it.
[06:12:31] <pflanze> I generally prefer to edit Markdown nowadays, but it would be super cool to automatically convert between the two.
[06:12:53] <simcop2387> pandoc is the closest to being able to do that
[06:14:46] <pflanze> Good point. It doesn't appear to support POD yet, but it would be easier to add it to pandoc than to write a converter from ~scratch in Perl.
[06:15:18] <pflanze> And it probably has better testing infrastructure, too.
[06:15:26] <pflanze> (Without checking.)
[06:18:10] <simcop2387> pod to markdown would be easy in perl, but since you'd want the reverse too it'd be worth it to just go add it to pandoc anyway so you also get all the other format support

[13:32:18] <PlayerOne> $byte = tell;
[13:32:26] <PlayerOne> Yaakov, thank you ^^
[13:33:11] <PlayerOne> Anyways... the issue is that code returns the same output(except line) for input like 'aaaa'
[13:33:29] <PlayerOne> Because it removes first a and then second appears on its position
[13:33:38] <PlayerOne> I don't really get how to track that correctly
[13:33:54] <PlayerOne> Because replacement also may be non-empty like s/a/b/
[13:34:06] <PlayerOne> Or s/a/ab/
[13:34:21] <PlayerOne> This part -> $-[0], $byte + $-[0]
[13:34:54] <PlayerOne> Where $byte is the start of the line in bytes
[13:35:36] <PlayerOne> So, the mission is to print a position and byte replaced relatvely to the source
[13:35:48] <Yaakov> PlayerOne: I have to go do things but if this is still a nystery upon my return I wil endeavour to help.
[13:38:04] <PlayerOne> Yaakov, thank you very much, but I guess it's not so important

[20:14:16] <gordonfish> Yes anything you view in a browser is downloaded first to local cache stores, and after that it is displayed.
[20:14:27] <gordonfish> Which is something those who think ad blocking and page manipulating are some how illegal/violating their site/immoral/etc, when the fact is a user is just changing the local copy in the cache.
[20:15:01] <gordonfish> Which is something those people clearly don't understand
[20:15:07] <tm604> gordonfish: that's not really how it works...
[20:15:09] <lopid> i have it so i just right click a link in firefox and "open with mpv" runs whatever the best quality video is available for my screen size. very handy for not having to deal with youtube web pages

[20:16:06] <Altreus> They don't do that any more
[20:16:07] <tm604> doesn't necessarily cache anything either
[20:16:17] <Altreus> They don't even download the entire video *while* playing it nowadays
[20:16:30] <Altreus> So if you have a shitty connection there's no way to force it to cache a bit more
[20:16:39] <Altreus> Or pause it while it caches the whole lot, then watch it
[20:16:41] <gordonfish> I didn't say it did, but it does download chunks at a time, which is why one can scrub for a bit in most in browser video players
[20:16:44] <Altreus> (except with youtube-dl)

[20:18:07] <tm604> huh - they do? /me confused
[20:18:13] <Adura> Carbon reduction, though.
[20:18:18] <gordonfish> I've spent quite a bit of time in the past looking at what a browser is doing. Older browsers, like many versions of IE, would actually download entire videos (though that was before most places started chunking with .ts portions and similar.
[20:18:21] <tm604> *adverts* are immoral, sure - but blocking? meh
[20:18:21] <Altreus> Considering what I have to put up with when I'm on a device with adblock, I'd have to offer the opinion that the ads are what's immoral
[20:18:45] <gordonfish> Altreus: You may be surprised how some people go crazy at people talking about ad blocking.
[20:19:04] <Altreus> I'm honestly surprised ads are even economically valuable
[20:19:12] <gordonfish> Put simply, a user had every right to control what their browser, like any other program running on their computer/device, is doing.

[20:22:39] <gordonfish> I remember in the 2000s one could go into Temporary Internet Files on a windows computer after viewing a video and just pull it out of their (just looking for the largest file and by date), and there were similar ways with older mozilla browsers. Today it's all in chunks and there have been extensions that could crab each chunk, but youtube-dl has made most of 'em moot.
[20:22:59] <thrig> so modern browsers blow chunks?
[20:23:13] * gordonfish nods
[20:23:42] <tm604> sounds like a lot of work - I'd have to track down a Windows computer to start with!

[23:16:35] <Yaakov> It looks pretty good and I want to support them anyway.
[23:17:24] <Grinnz> Adura: if "decentralization" is "moving off freenode" :D
[23:17:30] <gordonfish> Is it even worth paying attempting to what Lee/FN is doing anymore?
[23:17:38] <Grinnz> gordonfish: absolutely, it's top tier drama

[23:18:42] <integral> aww, @root is refusing to ban matrix too :-(
[23:18:42] <gordonfish> Grinnz: Yeah but it's starting to feel like watching reruns right after watching the first run
[23:18:47] <Yaakov> Grinnz: Their iOS and web clients seem fairly nice, and no problems getting this Irssi client up and running.

[23:19:03] <Grinnz> integral: now THAT would be funny - matrix bridge is like half their remaining users
[23:19:17] <gordonfish> heh
[23:19:24] <gordonfish> burn the bridge
[23:20:02] <Grinnz> Yaakov: yeah, they have a dedicated iOS/android app dev and it shows
[23:20:12] <xenu> the sad thing is it seems that freenode is losing users faster than libera is gaining them
[23:20:23] <gordonfish> FN had dedicated mobile apps?
[23:20:54] <gordonfish> xenu: Like an overflowing toilet
[23:21:10] <Yaakov> I used it WAY early on and it wasn't better than my own psybnc so I didn't sign up.
[23:21:31] <Yaakov> But now it's very slick indeed. I like it.
[23:21:50] <gordonfish> xenu: Most users are finding their way, some will spill over but will eventually get there too
[23:21:55] <Grinnz> xenu: that's what policies that kline idlers will do
[23:22:07] <pragma-> what's amazing to me is that i didn't even notice gordonfish said "attempting" instead of attention. i'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. *squints at brain's autocorrect*
[23:22:54] <gordonfish> They've been klining idlers?
[23:23:21] <xenu> banning irccloud == klining idlers
[23:23:38] <xenu> certainly many irccloud users were idling
[23:24:25] <Grinnz> yes, and they've been fucking up other klines
[23:24:35] <Grinnz> and i expect more to come
[23:24:40] <gordonfish> pragma-: The bran is amazing at carroting tings up via contractual clues :)

[23:26:24] <pragma-> er, too
[23:27:03] <gordonfish> If it's a slang I assume it refers to some sort of food fight
[23:27:19] <gordonfish> (or maybe dying hair orange?)
[23:27:45] <gordonfish> (which way back might have been done with actual carrots)
[23:28:00] <pragma-> it's always seemed to me that "carrot top" should mean they have green hair, because when you hold a carrot in the position it grows, the green bits are on top, like its hair...
[23:28:09] <gordonfish> Great point
[23:28:24] <gordonfish> Yeah the orange part is the root
