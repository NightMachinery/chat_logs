[16:47:20] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: fun
[16:49:31] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: for the former, it's because my update also upgraded typing_extensions in pylint requirements, but the your tests requirements have an older version - I'd actually suggest not adding astroid/pylint to the test requirements, and instead adjusting tox.ini to install requirements-pylint.txt for the tests
[16:50:00] <pylbrecht> The-Compiler: oh yeah, neat way of solving that. Thanks!
[16:50:39] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: might want to use pytest.importorskip in your test module though, to make things easier for Linux distributions running our testsuite

[16:58:06] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: reported it here: https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid/issues/1282 - next we should ignore it via "filterwarnings =" in pytest.ini. Add a link to that issue too please, like with the python-hunter thing :)
[17:03:46] <pylbrecht> The-Compiler: not sure what you're referring to with "python-hunter", but I will add the link to the issue along with the "filterwarnings =" if that's what you meant?

[17:22:33] <pylbrecht> The-Compiler: and adding pylint requirements to tox.ini did not fix the typing_extensions issue, unfortunately.
[17:23:04] <pylbrecht> but maybe I added them to the wrong place?
[17:45:12] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: yep, astroid and pylint, so that distribution tests wanting to install qutebrowser and test their installs don't need to add those as dependencies
[17:50:40] <The-Compiler> pylbrecht: sigh, ok, same issue of course even with the split files - though I don't understand where the 4.0.0 is coming from
