[16:46:15] <gas51627> Hi 
[16:47:36] <b3z> Hello.
[16:47:41] *** Parts: b3z (~b3z@user/b3z) ()

[16:48:33] <gas51627> I have a question. I installed java11 with homebrew. It was installed in the cellar. I linked it to /Libraries. When i ran `man java` it still shows me the man of the old version i have installed previously. I understand that this question is more man-related than brew related, then please let me know where i could ask it
[16:49:34] <gas51627> The question is how does man work with multiple versions of library installed and how i can change the default 
[16:55:48] <b3z> Why is man important? What does java --version return?
[17:07:01] <gas51627> Java version returns the correct version
[17:07:14] <gas51627> Its only man and info that show old pages
[17:07:58] <gas51627> I find it cool to have man from the same version that i use
[17:12:37] <b3z> the man command only shows pages from a directory (/usr/share/man/). If there is no entry for your java version there also will be no man page. E.g. /usr/share/man/man1/java_home.1
[17:14:19] <gas51627> Ok, I was looking at man config file, i will check it again. So, i will have to manually link/unlink the man of the new version then. Do you know about info by chance?
[17:15:10] <b3z> Probably, or at least look for the right one maybe you just view the wrong page. 
[17:15:15] <b3z> Sadly I don't use man.
[17:16:10] <b3z> maybe ask in #linux
[18:29:29] <gas51627> Thanks a lot
[19:46:00] <sixecho> gas51627: as they are keg-only - they are also not setup to co-exist with multiple javas... you can directly access that java's man pages with something like `MANPATH=/usr/local/Cellar/openjdk/16.0.1/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home/man man java`
[19:48:33] <gas51627> Thanks, the solution was to add that new java to the PATH, then man searches directories around it and finds the man page. So it worked right from the beginning but the man file itself is outdated, thats why i thought it's from a different installation
[19:48:50] <sixecho> gas51627: if you have multiple jdk's installed and need to access the man pages easily/frequently - you can use that or add some shell scripts to set that manpath dynamically; or some env managers might set the manpath when you set your env jdk.   several options.
[19:51:42] <gas51627> Yeah, thanks. If only developers updated the man page
[19:53:14] <gas51627> I mean if they don't update man page then it's all for nothing
[19:53:16] <sixecho> gas51627: file a bug i guess since it's openjdk;  and/or check if it's even fixed in v16 for comparison
