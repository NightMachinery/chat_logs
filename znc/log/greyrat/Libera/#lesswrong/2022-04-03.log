LSE: Fact-Checking The Kremlin’s Version Of Russian History: [The notion that Ukraine is not a country in its own right, but a historical part of Russia, appears to be deeply ingrained in the minds of many in the Russian leadership. Already long before the Ukraine crisis, at an April 2008 NATO summit in …)
[03:38:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> I see the tradition of looking into Russian leaders' eyes and discerning their souls go back some way
[03:39:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Joseph E. Davies, who had been ambassador to Russia briefly and would be at Truman’s side daily at the potsdam conference table, had said in a superficial and immensely popular book, Mission to Moscow, published in 1941, that Stalin was uncommonly wise and gentle. “A child would like to sit on his lap and a dog would sidle up to him,” wrote Davies. Even Eisenhower, after a visit to Moscow later that summer, would
[03:39:10] <Obormot\Arcturus>  describe Stalin in much the same fashion, as “benign and fatherly.”
[03:39:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Truman, as he wrote, found Stalin to be polite, good-natured, businesslike, “honest—but smart as hell.” There had been not a hint of contention between them. The conference hadn’t even begun, yet already Truman had achieved his main objective, as he recorded triumphantly in his diary. “He’ll be in the Jap War on August 15. Fini Japs when that comes about…. I can deal with Stalin.”"
[03:39:42] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: doesn't even include that roosevelt quote that came up a month or two ago
[03:41:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> I missed that, which?
[03:42:41] <kuudes> why would it matter what putin says about ukraine not being a country? russia had an embassy there, so certainly they had agreed that ukraine is a country

[03:46:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> ah
[03:47:16] * gwern reads it again. it is a nonfiction essay by a well-placed ambassador published in a high-profile highly-trusted magazine which presents a straightforward recalled quote from FDR. but how can it be real???? it's one of the stupidest things ever said in the history of mankind, by a smart and savvy motherfucker
[03:48:05] <gwern> maybe someone is playing a hoax with the google books archives
[03:49:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Man that is some high-grade stupidity
[03:49:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Unrelatedly: I have a mathematical intuition that maybe someone here can confirm/contradict:
[03:49:32] <dTal> "greaterwrong.com" is this some april fools spoof opposite day website
[03:50:24] <spxtr> greaterwrong is somehow much nicer than lesswrong, contrary to the name
[03:50:32] <ivan> dTal: it's a software development schism, a nitter to a twitter 
[03:50:46] <dTal> I'm just skimming the article though and it seems smart
[03:51:53] <dTal> I also tend to think that fear of AGI itself is too far sighted, the real problem - like everything else - is what happens when humans get their hands on powerful tech
[03:52:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Define x = dY as "x is the result of uniform-randomly generating an integer in [1,Y]" (i.e. standard dice notation). Then consider the following 2-player gambling game: Player 1 rolls a die, i.e. he does B = dA. Player 2 then does C = dB (i.e. he rolls a die of the size equal to the result of the first roll). Player 1 then rolls D = dC; Player 2 does E = dD; and so on. The game ends when a player rolls 1, which is a loss.
[03:52:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> It seems to me like Player 1 (first to roll) is always at an advantage, for any starting die size A, being less likely to be the first to roll 1 (and lose) than Player 2.
[03:52:40] <dTal> track record of machines rising up against humanity: 0 times. Track record of humanity using new technology to do horrifying things to each other: too many times to enumerate
[03:52:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> That seem right to you guys?
[03:53:15] <PlanckWalk> Hmm, player A also has the first opportunity to lose
[03:53:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yep that's true
[03:53:24] <PlanckWalk> Err, player 1
[03:53:29] <gwern> because he could roll a 1 immediately?
[03:53:58] <PlanckWalk> I'm not intuitively sure whether that disadvantage outweighs the likely larger die advantage.
[03:54:04] <gwern> this feels like a problem where it could depend on parity
[03:54:25] <PlanckWalk> Like, consider starting with D2
[03:54:38] <PlanckWalk> Player 1 definitely loses more on average
[03:55:18] <PlanckWalk> (2/3 probability)
[03:55:52] <gwern> because you either lose instantly, or it is merely symmetrical for player 2 who now is equivalent to player 1 - rolling with a 2
[03:56:48] <PlanckWalk> yes.  With d3, there's a 1/3 chance to lose instantly, 1/3 for player 2 to have to roll a d2 (and eventually lose with 2/3 probability), and 1/3 to roll a d3
[03:58:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> hmm
[03:58:27] <PlanckWalk> So player 1 has 5/12 chance to win there
[03:58:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> How do you get "1/3 to roll a d3" exactly
[03:58:50] <PlanckWalk> Player 1 rolls 3
[03:59:00] <PlanckWalk> So then player 2 rolls a d3
[03:59:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh nm I misread
[03:59:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah
[03:59:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> dTal: So the problem with that reasoning is just "why not both"
[04:00:24] <gwern> sounds like parity, yeah. it's in zugzwang, so you don't want to move, and the disadvantage shifts based on whether you're even or odd
[04:00:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> dTal: Yes, for sure we're gonna do horrible things to each other with new tech, we're doing it right now as we speak, but unfortunately that doesn't prevent it from *also* being the case that an AGI will kill us all while we're doing that
[04:00:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> What is zugzwang
[04:01:27] <Betawolf> or who is Zug
[04:01:28] <gwern> a compelled move that makes you worse off. you would rather not roll and hand the dice to the other player
[04:01:34] <PlanckWalk> It looks like there's a recurrence  p(N) for player 1 winning starting with N-sided die such that  (N+1) p(N+1) = 1 + Sum_{k<N} P(k)

[04:03:20] <PlanckWalk> (Forgot to switch players to get probability)

[04:10:21] <saturn2> oh, i misread the question, nevermind
[04:12:31] <PlanckWalk> Oops no, it's 9/20 for d4
[04:13:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Does that mean that d5 is ... 14/30??
[04:13:43] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[04:14:33] <gwern> so d1 is 0/1 0%, d2 is 1/3 33%, d3 is 5/12 42%, d4 is 9/20 45%, d5 is 14/30 46%... hm, so no parity after all, just the player 1 zugswang gradually eroding away asymptotically to 50%
[04:15:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Interesting
[04:17:29] <PlanckWalk> So yeah, by induction it is  1/2 - 1/(N(N+1))

[12:06:15] <dbohdan[phone]> This is the one heresy you are not supposed to bring up
[12:06:31] <ggreer> dbohdan[phone]: the anti-music thing sounds like a rebranding of certain islamic dogma
[12:07:02] <dbohdan[phone]> Hmm
[12:07:13] <dbohdan[phone]> "Islam is right about music"
[12:07:13] <ggreer> "If we elected people much older than they actually are, they'd be dying in office." <-- I assume at least half of the senate is wax sculptures at this point
[12:07:19] <ggreer> dbohdan[phone]: XD
[12:07:23] <saturn2> quanticle: even that one people still get away with
[12:07:26] <quanticle> Yeah, but heresy is contextual. I assume that he's talking about heresy in a United States (and more specifically, California) context.
[12:07:56] <quanticle> saturn2: Sort of? I've seen people get away with it, and I've seen people get persecuted for it, so I'm counting it.
[12:08:25] <quanticle> Steve Sailer gets away with it, but that Google engineer was persecuted. But you're right. It's borderline. 
[12:08:38] <quanticle> But it's a hell of a lot closer to actual heresy than any of these 20
[12:09:27] <ggreer> heresies are very context dependent. for example, here's a heresy at work: https://geoff.greer.fm/re-avoiding-oppressive-terminology/

[12:12:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Dyo: Thanks
[12:13:06] <quanticle> ggreer: The only quibble I have with the second one is: "As this company grows, so will the diversity of beliefs held by the workforce."
[12:13:16] <quanticle> And my reply is, "Political belief is not a protected class"
[12:13:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean
[12:13:54] <quanticle> You can't be fired for being black, but you can be fired for being a climate-change denier, young earth creationist, Trump supporter, or gun owner.
[12:14:03] <ggreer> I just meant it as a statistical thing. if you go from 500 employees to 5,000, the political beliefs will almost certainly be broader

[12:14:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Do you guys remember the time someone posted a Google survey or something that was like "rationalists, tell us anonymously stuff you think but can't say in rationalist circles"

[12:14:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> And posted the responses

[12:18:36] <dbohdan[phone]> I think, like the author of the post, I have managed to get *my* operating definition of the word "heresy" stretched enough to include "would get you weird looks from FAANG people". This is despite that I interact with actually inadmissible views and understand the difference. I am not sure how it happened. 
[12:19:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Some quality heresies in here!
[12:19:06] <quanticle> "A general rule of, 'It’s OK for insurance to take political stances.' makes everyone worse-off and invites calls for regulation. I don’t know about you, but I sure don’t trust the current administration to regulate insurance in a way that is beneficial to society."
[12:19:08] <quanticle> This is even better because the post is undated.
[12:20:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Leverage is a cult" ... the entirety of one response. This is 2019 btw
[12:20:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> "There is a culture of starting but not finishing projects. The predominance of this kind of work seems to indicate that a significant minority are involved in EA to build a resume/virtue signal rather than effecting positive change. " gosh
[12:21:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> "CFAR workshops allow people in the rationalist and AI safety communities to socialise and network with each other in cushy countryside mansions. It would be a convenient coincidence if funding such activities was also a good use of altruistic money. Yet there is essentially no public evidence that CFAR helps its attendees be more effective in their altruistic pursuits. This leads me to believe that providing cushy 4-day
[12:21:29] <Obormot\Arcturus>  vacations with the in-group is in fact the primary purpose of CFAR. 
[12:21:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> CFAR is so popular that this criticism feels difficult to voice. Further, one day it might be advantageous for *my* career to attend a CFAR workshop, for networking purposes. So I'd better not say anything." ... gosh x2
[12:21:55] <quanticle> Okay, I can't speak to the status of the "Leverage is a cult" belief in 2019, but wasn't the culture of starting projects and not finishing them extensively discussed in both rationalist and post-rationalist circles. Didn't Duncan Sabien like, make this his whole thing?
[12:23:15] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: The CFAR stuff does strike me as properly heretical. It's as if they're suggesting that CFAR workshops are less about the ostensible work and more about fancy junkets. Questioning the motives of the leadership is always a good heresy.
[12:23:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course then there's stuff like this
[12:23:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Given that America has the world's largest military, many nuclear weapons, many top universities, etc. it's not smart to push for any immigration increase which could plausibly decrease governance quality.  It's incredibly important for the global cop to do a good job"
[12:23:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's a good one, imo!

[12:26:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Heat up that take a bit more and you're g2g
[12:26:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> "If a person of color from a developing country started an initiative to offer free genetic engineering to people in developing countries, on the condition that in addition to parent preferences, the child also received genes known to be associated with reason and altruism, that could be an incredibly high impact long-termist project" lol.
[12:27:06] <quanticle> It would be a good heresy if it were true. From what I understand, Nazi eugenics was just as bro-science as the rest of Nazi science.

[12:37:59] <quanticle> Is this how heresy works lads?
[12:39:12] <quanticle> But yeah, the idea that Petrov wasn't a hero but instead was a traitor doesn't really strike me as all that heretical, given that I farmed a lot of imaginary internet points off that thread.
[12:41:24] <saturn2> heretics without a heresy
[12:43:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, as far as these new alleged heresies go
[12:43:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> #1 is diametrically false, actually live music mostly is not as great, and in some genres (rock, metal, etc.) it's just way worse to listen to them live than recorded
[12:44:20] <quanticle> "Vox is harmful to discourse and truth-seeking." <-- Says a lot that this can be considered a heresy
[12:44:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> #2 is half and half, first half is meh but I do like the "child sex robots" bit just for that line
[12:45:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> #3 seems absurd, of course I can imagine what would cause someone to think this and it's very unflattering
[12:45:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> #4 uh, well, compared to some of the other stuff we do, yeah, maybe, but ...
[12:45:47] <quanticle> "Abortion is a moral catastrophe and we should invest a lot of resources trying to reduce it" <-- This seems genuinely heretical for the Bay Area
[12:45:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> #5 who gives a shit about basketball rules
[12:46:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> #6 seems clearly true
[12:46:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> #7 already discussed, silly
[12:46:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> #8 lol @ "by tweaking dating algorithms", otherwise seems descriptively correct I guess
[12:46:52] <saturn2> why are some of these one sentence and others go on and on
[12:47:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> #9 very lol, definitely heretical, but who can truly oppose what is basically "MAD SCIENCE FUCK YEAH"
[12:48:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> #10 just seems like a silly troll take, hard to take this one seriously
[12:48:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> #11 yeah gwern already did this one, as cited
[12:48:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> (but he wasn't being serious)
[12:48:43] *** cyberjunkie_ is now known as cyberjunkie
[12:49:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> #12 maybe was heretical at some point, now almost mainstream...
[12:50:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> #13 just seems poorly thought out, like have you heard of bacteria at all
[12:50:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> #14 is dumb as a whole but I would like to hear more about "educational terrorism", that sounds like fun
[12:51:43] <saturn2> with embalming and refrigeration i think it would be practical to have dead bodies in every school
[12:52:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> #15 seems like an extrapolation from some mighty thin anecdotal evidence and anyway is more like "speculative insight porn a la cut-rate ribbonfarm" than "heresy"
[12:52:44] <saturn2> students could also practice killing cute animals with their bare hands
[12:52:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> #16 kinda heretical yeah
[12:53:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Good idea
[12:54:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> In our high school AP Bio class (which I didn't take) they did cat dissections; in my freshman year "Advanced Topics" Bio (which I did take) we did pig fetus dissections
[12:54:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Seems like we could soup those up by including a "kill it yourself" part to that project
[12:54:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> With the pigs of course we'd need to let them be born first but that seems doable
[12:54:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> They were late-stage fetuses anyhow
[12:55:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> #17 isn't this Valentine's dumb "hypercreature" thing
[12:55:18] <quanticle> My dad had to do that
[12:55:21] <quanticle> With frogs
[12:55:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guess that's heretical-ish
[12:55:40] <quanticle> Because in India they didn't have preservation. So they'd have to kill the frogs before dissecting them
[12:55:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Makes sense
[12:56:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> #18 is a bit heretical but directionally orthodox
[12:58:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> #19 is def. heretical, I like it
[12:58:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Well, it's dumb, actually, but it is heretical!)
[12:58:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Also this guy really likes William James, eh)
[12:59:29] <quanticle> It is heretical, but I will note all those people writing about the martial glory of war from about 1880 to 1914 got spectacularly pwned by the horror of World War 1
[12:59:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah I thought the same
[12:59:51] <quanticle> And quite a lot of them, if they survived the Great War, were like, "Holy shit, War is actually *awful*"
[13:00:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> "the beauty of war" "congruous with human nature" yeah we sure learned better didn't we

[14:12:18] <dbohdan[phone]> I am thinking about what strongly heretical beliefs I hold that aren't commonplace for the category of heretical beliefs. I have at least two I have proved heretical with human testing.
[14:13:31] <dbohdan[phone]> 1. There may be too few nuclear powers in the world
[14:14:47] <dbohdan[phone]> 2. Straight men and women have evolved to be, on average, poor partners for each other. It is a humanitarian priority to engineer better partners for both.
[14:18:43] <dbohdan[phone]> ("Poor" in the sense of relationship satisfaction in our times, not from their genes' perspective)

[22:49:58] <gwern> (the US did fairly seriously consider various versions of it which would've been a lot more explicit than the UN+IMF+etc turned out to be, and rejected it for reasons mostly not having to do with the power of atomic bombs used to their fullest extent, but I didn't want to get into it)

[23:04:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> SSL certs and expiry thereof have got to be one of the most annoying technical features of the modern internet
[23:05:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Absurd that we can't find a better way to prevent hax and/or sploits than this nonsense
[23:06:31] <rmmh> Let's encrypt really emphasizes it

[23:09:22] <rmmh> I actually like cloudflare for it
[23:09:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Browsers these days being like "ONLY HTTPS ALLOWED"
[23:09:43] <rmmh> just subjugate your whole domain to them, then use certificate pairs to authenticate with cloudflare that never expire 
[23:09:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol
[23:09:55] <rmmh> and let them handle refreshing certs
[23:10:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> More centralization, yay :p
[23:10:25] <kuudes> I guess you could use self signed certs and repel users?
[23:10:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, it's a total shitshow, that's the bottom line
[23:10:26] <dbohdan[phone]> Caddy's built-in automatic management of Let's Encrypt certs removes a lot of friction. It was what made me enable HTTPS on every site.
[23:10:36] <kuudes> I blame NSA
[23:10:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> dbohdan[phone]: NFSN auto-manages certs too, it's great
[23:10:55] <rmmh> dbohdan[phone]: yeah it's when you set up one of the scripts on nginx and it screws up 3 months later
[23:11:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> dbohdan[phone]: One of the many reasons I <3 NFSN: apache, but cert management is handled forever
[23:11:24] <dbohdan[phone]> rmmh: Yeah
[23:13:04] <dbohdan[phone]> Obormot\Arcturus: Sounds nice. I prefer Apache to Nginx for having fewer footguns in configuration.
[23:14:17] <dbohdan[phone]> (And I prefer Caddy to Apache, except Apache can do things Caddy can't, like WebDAV. Even Nginx can't do fully compatible WebDAV even with that one extension.)

[23:30:00] <two2thehead> kuudes, re plastic bag, probably not
[23:30:08] <two2thehead> plastic bucket*
[23:30:28] <two2thehead> I'm not an expert though
[23:35:15] <zebrask> quanticle: They think cats aren't conscious? Can you be reincarnated as a rock?
[23:35:20] <saturn2> a plastic bucket could protect you somewhat from flying debris
[23:35:31] <quanticle> zebrask: Rocks aren't alive, though.
[23:35:49] <zebrask> I think the idea would be that the mokshabots would also not be alive.
[23:36:26] <quanticle> Well, they're capable of self-replication and information processing. That rounds out to alive to me.
[23:36:27] <two2thehead> okay, some helmet function from a plastic bucket
[23:36:49] <two2thehead> could certainly protect you from flying glass
[23:36:53] <two2thehead> saturn2, +1
[23:37:13] <zebrask> I suppose it's really just a question of how much does the "Buddhism" meme need to mutate before you could get a sect of it trying to wipe out all life everywhere.
[23:37:29] <zebrask> I think the number of mutations here is worryingly low.
[23:39:13] <zebrask> Just like, "We can create non-conscious automata, reincarnation cannot happen if there is nothing conscious to reincarnate as, it is easier to wipe out all life everywhere than to get everyone to achieve enlightenment"
[23:39:22] <kuudes> it seems to me a plastic bucket does not crumble if you lower it to lake, so it at least withstands 1 atm of pressure from outside. if you put a sealing lid to it, I wonder to what depth it would stay without crumbling
[23:39:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> zebrask: There are already negative utilitarian rationalists/EAs who were influenced there by Buddhism
[23:39:30] <kuudes> was it that each 4 meters is about 1 atm more?
[23:39:37] <quanticle> I'm pretty sure you don't know enough Buddhism to be saying that, but that's just me.
[23:40:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, like, "worryingly low" turns out to be "0", is what I am saying
[23:40:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> We're already there
[23:40:33] <quanticle> Are there EAs who think that all life should be wiped out?
[23:40:37] <quanticle> That sounds fascinating.

[23:42:25] <kuudes> saturn2, how fast is the pressure wave? the pressure into bucket would travel only at speed of sound
[23:42:55] <zebrask> quanticle: Yeah I'd really like to know more before I write anything up (it's more a fun idea to think about given that Buddhists have a famously anti-violence image), but I think there are enough violent strains of other religions that it's not *absurd* to imagine a strain of Buddhism where people take the "all life is suffering" seriously enough that they want to wipe out all life.

[23:54:02] <Robomot> Shock wave - Wikipedia (In physics, a shock wave (also spelled shockwave), or shock, is a type of propagating disturbance that moves faster than the local speed of sound in the medium. Like an ordinary wave, a shock wave carries energy and can propagate through a medium but is characterized by an abrupt, nearly discontinuous, change in pressure, temperature, and density of the medium.[1][2][3][4][5][6])
