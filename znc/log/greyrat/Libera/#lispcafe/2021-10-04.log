[03:30:52] <kakuhen> slightly offtopic question, but does anyone here know of a cheap 2.5 inch hard drive enclosure with its own power supply
[03:31:14] <kakuhen> i want to eventually connect two hard drives to a raspi, but that will need quite a bit of power, hence the need for separate power for the hard drive
[03:32:05] <kakuhen> (in case it matters: i am not buying an ssd because i already have the drives and would rather use them until they break down)
[03:33:30] <hayley> I just picked the cheapest one from the nearest computer store. That was a 3.5" drive but it shouldn't matter.
[03:34:33] <hayley> The poverty of the poverty of post-open source posting: "might be annoying but i recommend saying free software instead of open source, open source is really a term made up by corporations to benefit from" "Even then the free software movement is more lolbertarian/propertarian than it is actually is libertarian socialist" "Even then the post open source movement is more centralist than it is libertarian or socialist"

So my plan is to make it robust and at least notice that sth is not ok.

[03:59:41] <gilberth> This might also be kind of runaway flow control. chaosd block somehow and since there are ack packets the sender would keep resending and resending, being blocked too eventually. Or sth like this.
[04:00:00] <gilberth> * no ack
[04:02:04] <gilberth> I mean this doesn't happen on a real ether, a CPU would not stall because the ether is full. It can't be full. There might be collisions, but that is sth different.
[04:04:11] <gilberth> And I would need to educate myself about the Chaosnet protocol wrt to streams.
[04:05:38] <gilberth> Reading a file is like a FTP get operation. "I'll like to have this and that file, please send it to me on that and that port, thanks." And then the file server would just attempt to blast the whole file in the general direction.
[04:09:05] <gilberth> Amd like in CL ore FTP there is both a binary and a text mode.
[04:17:33] <gilberth> Anyhow, I really need a break, I am getting impatient and seek the quick hack without knowing what I do. Tinkering until it somehow works, is not a proper strategy.
[04:21:52] <hayley> gilberth: So, what were you saying was missing in The Poverty of Post-Open Source? I forgot what words to search for in the logs.
[04:24:12] <hayley> "I read your article about post open source. It was not easy to get through. Yet, I would have hoped you debunked that, even if some task is hard, people still attack that task without being bribed."
[04:24:33] <hayley> I hope this is not too hard to show, come to think of it. I do it all the time.
[04:25:20] <gilberth> I don't quite remember.
[04:26:45] <hayley> Just that line.
[04:27:34] <hayley> Still, the existence of a large amount of FOSS code shows this to be true.
[04:27:58] <gilberth> What exactly being true?
[04:28:38] <hayley> That people attack hard problems without being paid.
[04:29:03] <gilberth> They do it all the time, that was my point.
[04:30:05] <gilberth> Or were those both idiots, who like to visit here, paid for diving into an RE night mare?
[04:31:30] <gilberth> Actually the opposite is true: People get paid to do mundane tasks. :-)
[04:34:25] <hayley> So I don't think it is as necessary to mention in an article. But that people might have reasons to program is harder to argue.
[04:35:41] <hayley> (And "Programming isn't hard" is subjective and too hairy, but "people are making programming unnecessarily hard, and in no small part so that they can excuse other bullshit" is less so.)
[04:36:03] <gilberth> I was under the impression that was this argument that people would only attack hard problems when brided. Which just is not true.
[04:36:18] <hayley> Hm.
[04:36:19] <gilberth> Why do people like to grow flowers in their garden?
[04:36:46] <hayley> I don't think that is really brought up.
[04:36:59] <gilberth> Then, perhaps, I misread.
[04:38:03] <hayley> If people want to get paid for attacking hard problems, I have no problems with that. (But, generally, I agree that people don't usually need that.) But it is bad to extrapolate that to running every project like a business.
[04:39:13] <hayley> Especially when modern software development (unless you have a purchasing department and a large budget) relies on snarfing freely available code.
[04:39:30] <gilberth> So the original argument was: "You must run a free software project as a business, with a hierarchy, otherwise it won't work, because it's hard?"
[04:40:17] <gilberth> hayley: Yes, even beings with tools like a C compiler.
[04:40:32] <hayley> Pretty much.
[04:41:08] <hayley> But it's more "You must run a free software project as a business, with a hierarchy and hiding intellectual property; but the latter is no big loss, as most people won't program because it's too hard."
[04:42:04] <gilberth> And often businesses borrow from each other in your egoist fashion. Someone publishes a tool, someone else finds a bug and shares the fix.
[04:42:30] <hayley> And, I admit, I don't know if your average Joe can program or not. But I shouldn't make up his mind for him, by making it impossible already.
[04:43:59] <gilberth> hayley: The argument is nuts. Even if most people don't hack, and most don't, this does not imply I can't have a free software project as union of egoists. This is completely unrelated.
[04:44:55] <hayley> Yes, as long as someone does hack, then it has value to that someone. I mention that too.
[04:45:27] <gilberth> I mean what difference does it make that, say, my wife cannot hack?
[04:46:15] <hayley> I don't know. But it's also important to distinguish between "gilberth's wife cannot hack because the Ethically Developed(tm) compiler costs $10,000" and "gilberth's wife cannot hack because she doesn't see the point in it".
[04:46:44] <gilberth> Yep.
[04:47:28] <gilberth> In fact she would see the point, but it's just she never bothered to learn that, because it's "hard".
[04:48:27] <gilberth> That is completely irrelevant. I could appreciate a software being open source and thus in principle be fixed by someone, even if I personally don't know how.
[04:48:41] <gilberth> Again, this is irrelevant.
[04:50:10] <hayley> So the points presented are 1. programmers still exist, even if they are uncommon 2. people could want to program already, don't make their minds up for them 3. you're screwed if you promote bad program design 4. making programming hard can be used to excuse keeping things secret 5. keeping things secret makes programming hard 6. open source programmers are unorganised, and it delivers
[04:50:50] <gilberth> Actually I don't know what the fuss is, everyone can organize their project as he wishes.
[04:51:00] <gilberth> But yes: yes.
[04:51:39] <hayley> The "conspiracy theory" is that people do #3 in order to get into a loop with #4 and #5, and assert dominance that way.
[04:51:41] <gilberth> And: My wife for example could appreciate that she could pay someone to fix some tool, which is free software.
[04:52:08] <gilberth> hayley: So, it's about power?
[04:52:14] <hayley> Yes.
[04:52:32] <gilberth> Now, we are getting somewhere.
[04:53:58] <White_Flame> software has been on a cycle of re-invention of the same wheels, cycling over and over and never getting very far
[04:54:05] <White_Flame> ever since its beginning
[04:54:05] <hayley> The end result is a sort of centralised, workerist phony "socialism", not unlike a digital replica of the Eastern bloc from 1950-1985 or whatever.
[04:54:29] <White_Flame> and those resets are always some idiot wanting to sell a book, course, or piece of software that exists on nothing but branding and bad ideas, which gains traction with managers
[04:54:43] <hayley> White_Flame: It's not re-invention, it's just incredibly stupid. Like saying that "clean code is a fantasy for neckbeards" and "open source code leads to security problems".
[04:54:44] <gilberth> hayley: Perhaps you name is: It's about feeling elite somehow by founding a closed circle. Next.
[04:54:49] <White_Flame> because they're marketed to as the "next hot thing"
[04:55:13] <hayley> c.f. the quotes in this section https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/gnuxie-lulamoon-and-hayley-patton-the-poverty-of-post-open-source#toc2

[04:55:25] <White_Flame> even if it's completely disingenuous
[04:55:40] <White_Flame> since they're no better and their ideas are no different than what already exists
[04:55:44] <gilberth> When I need money I found a business. Simple.
[04:56:02] <White_Flame> that's a great way to lose money for 80% of founded businesses ;)
[04:56:14] <gilberth> Sure.
[04:56:17] <hayley> Well, there is nothing different to a business with this, other than handwaving about "ethics" and "cooperative principles".
[04:56:37] * White_Flame reads the article
[04:56:43] <gilberth> But that is part of the point: If they are so brilliant and superior they could found a business and get rich fast(TM).
[04:57:10] <White_Flame> brilliance & superiority does not make you a good businessman, unless those qualities are in salesmanship
[04:57:24] <gilberth> Also very true.
[04:57:57] <gilberth> It sounds to me like "they" want to dogde that truth.
[04:58:14] <hayley> I feel I need to found with something, as there aren't exactly any compiler writing jobs for uneducated peoples such as myself. I mean, it doesn't have to be a compiler job, but not a complete fucking bore.
[04:58:26] <White_Flame> hmm, I don't think I have the background vocabulary required to understand this article
[04:58:30] <hayley> .oO(Two people asked you if you wanted to join Ravenpack, you know.)
[04:59:21] <gilberth> White_Flame: Yes, this is why I said "hard to follow".
[04:59:56] <hayley> It's just the quotes, really. The rest of the article is irrelevant.
[05:00:56] <gilberth> Anyhow, I never heard about that idea of closed circle "free" software before.
[05:02:48] <hayley> The reason why I bother is that I sort of blame myself for it. As I see it: Gnuxie informed me of the Telekommunist Manifesto, and we had spread it around, then people shittified it, and now we're here.
[05:02:52] <White_Flame> ok then, I don't think I have enough context to understand what those quotes are driving at and why they're being quoted ;)
[05:03:29] <White_Flame> I do believe, however, that free/nonfree is one of the biggest distinguishers to look at, software or not
[05:03:41] <White_Flame> and free means people are free to do good or bad
[05:03:53] <White_Flame> trying to prevent bad by extraneous means is always a weird counter-oppression
[05:04:04] <White_Flame> when stuff like technology & empowerment is generally neutral
[05:04:20] <gilberth> And then we have different factions of free. *sigh*
[05:04:27] <White_Flame> policing bad behavior isn't the role of software licenses, it's the role of police
[05:04:42] <hayley> With some beta-reduction: "We recognise the requirement of open source can lead to exposing sensitive information", "I wish people would believe I'm suited to using C in inappropriate situations", "Don't fuss with writing good code because people throw out code."
[05:04:46] <hayley> All very bad advice.
[05:05:08] <White_Flame> yeah, that fist quite is extremely weird
[05:05:10] <White_Flame> *first
[05:05:12] <White_Flame> *quote
[05:05:37] <gilberth> "fist quite" would also have made sense. :-)
[05:06:01] <White_Flame> but yeah, if people want to make closed-source stuff, then don't use GPL stuff.  duh.
[05:06:29] <White_Flame> but I have no idea how that ties into "the organization of software labor"
[05:06:41] <gilberth> I don't even consider GPL as "free". Too much strings. And there we are.
[05:06:43] <White_Flame> "free" stuff, unpaid stuff, personal projects, etc are not organized

[05:07:50] <hayley> Well, the source code is more or less the organisation of labour when it comes to FOSS codebases.
[05:08:06] <White_Flame> I hate that the advancement of software has effectively halted once there was a critical mass of users to be exploited that allowed tons of money to be made exploiting them
[05:08:07] <gilberth> White_Flame: Fair enough.
[05:08:36] <White_Flame> I hate that the industry hates the notion of users as programmers, or even deciders of what their machine should do
[05:08:39] <hayley> Although you don't tend to actually contribute back, since you don't usually have to modify libraries, you made the decision at the time you do 'git clone' or similar.

Any more organisation is plainly unnecessary, and trying to separate the two purposes of source materials, as they are used today, results in utterly absurd reasoning."
[05:13:22] <White_Flame> however, in the grand scheme of things, licenses & organization are really meaningless.  It's the discoveries and inventions that are important, and those spread regardless

[05:14:12] <gilberth> Had we inventions in computers? In the last thirty years? I must have been asleep.
[05:14:20] <White_Flame> and the entire purpose of patents is to make public that which was trade secret

[05:15:13] <hayley> I recall Oracle still has a patent on thread-group-local GCs.
[05:15:41] <gilberth> Machines got incredible fast and cheap, what else?
[05:15:43] <White_Flame> uh oh, they'd better sue erlang
[05:16:13] <White_Flame> gilberth: just software techniques to optimize to the new hardware instead of old in-order assumptions
[05:16:24] <hayley> No, I mean that n threads (n > 1) share a mutable subheap and they just STW on those threads to collect it.
[05:16:30] <White_Flame> but not really doing anythign different with it
[05:16:56] <White_Flame> yeah, I guess erlang would still me n=1
[05:16:57] <White_Flame> *be
[05:17:02] <hayley> Erlang has n = 1 and immutable heaps (which IIRC they did something with).
[05:17:30] <gilberth> White_Flame: That's just perfection of a kind, nothing fundamentally new.
[05:17:33] <White_Flame> right
[05:17:43] <White_Flame> enough to drive more useless PhD papers
[05:17:51] <gilberth> lol
[05:17:55] <hayley> With immutable objects (and eager evaluation, so not Haskell) you don't need barriers, and you don't really need forwarding pointers if you can stomach structure un-sharing.
[05:18:26] <White_Flame> un-sharing?
[05:18:56] <White_Flame> "Old Man Yells at Cloud 2.0s"
[05:18:57] <hayley> e.g. (let ((x (list 1))) (list x x x)) has sharing
[05:19:09] <gilberth> Anyhow, I found it very funny in the 90s as Java was hyped, that they reinvented the wheel all the time.
[05:19:18] <White_Flame> uuuugh
[05:19:36] <White_Flame> and of course python reinvented everything again, and rust, and javascript, and and and
[05:19:37] <hayley> Without forwarding pointers, a copying GC would copy the inner list thrice. Worst case, you have O(2^n) blowup in heap size...so don't try that.
[05:20:05] <White_Flame> literally a copying GC
[05:20:05] <gilberth> White_Flame: This is what depresses me at times.
[05:20:22] <hayley> Worse, with mutation, the GC would diverge and/or blow up with circular objects, but we forbid them by definition with no mutation and eager evaluation.
[05:20:36] <White_Flame> gilberth: and every reinvention wanted to hype their reinventions as new ideas.  Apple probably being the most egregious here
[05:20:49] <White_Flame> which again fractures everything, and prevents people from learning the past
[05:21:03] <gilberth> White_Flame: New is better, forgot? :-)
[05:21:21] <White_Flame> yes, I always forget that lie :)

[05:21:52] <hayley> "I wish they did the textbooks like this." "Yes"
[05:22:04] <White_Flame> I also think that's why the industry has such high turnover and burnout.  People see the cycle after a decade or two, and get off that go-nowhere wheel
[05:22:36] <hayley> idk, it doesn't faze me. I do my own thing in the corner.
[05:22:38] <White_Flame> hayley: heh, you're in class right now?
[05:22:44] <hayley> Well, except for when it does.
[05:22:45] <hayley> White_Flame: Yes.
[05:22:51] <White_Flame> noice
[05:23:26] <gilberth> Perhaps. What I also find funny is, that I often here from people: "Oh you're doing sth with computers, that is a fast paced field and you need to learn new things each day!" "Not really."
[05:23:26] <hayley> Usually I am not in maths workshops, because the programming style gives me headaches.
[05:24:48] <hayley> "What's the opposite of the CDF? The DDF?" "Dumulative distribution function" "<lecturer> Is that a thing?" "no"
[05:27:02] <White_Flame> gilberth: software _businesses_ are fast paced and competitive, but none of that has to do with tech
[05:29:03] <gilberth> It's rather adapting to "new" things which are used just because they are new.
[05:31:10] <White_Flame> trying to be the trendy hot thing is fast paced
[05:31:51] <gilberth> Yes. But there niches which are hopelessly out-of-date actually.
[05:32:47] <gilberth> Anyhow, I always wanted to found again in the tech business, when I'm healthy again. But the longer I look at it, I say "No, thanks."
[05:33:24] <White_Flame> yep
[05:33:41] <White_Flame> there's the allure of money, quick success, etc, but the odds & cost of it all are terribel
[05:34:19] <gilberth> Indeed. Also a bad match, because I am not motivated by money.
[05:34:27] <White_Flame> right, same here
[05:34:48] <White_Flame> I'd rather flip burgers to afford to do code in my own time and have my mental acuities intact
[05:35:57] <gilberth> Yep. I always said, all I need is a desk, a machine, coffee, and internet. Nothing more actually.
[05:36:33] <gilberth> A roof above would be nice and something to eat, too.

[06:04:01] <hayley> \/ not /, fucking markdown
[06:04:19] <hayley> Though it is beyond me how you produce such an intermediate state, which is not good.
[06:10:44] <hayley> Seems I am down to generating code for 24 states though, and the compiler is a bit faster (though it's still slow).
[06:12:19] <hayley> 26 states now!!1!
[06:12:52] <hayley> And now it only takes 88.65ms to compile!!!
[06:14:51] <hayley> But if we have a grep vector like this, then the first-most element in the vector succeeded in a match, and we don't have to search any more. No?
[06:17:34] <hayley> 18 states make it into generated code, which is close enough to gilberth now.

[06:36:42] <gilberth> It's only the CADR which notices and says: "Attempt to get a packet from #<CHAOS-CONNECTION 51234>, a connection whose host has died."
[06:36:43] <hayley> gilberth: What do you think of treating (either (alpha (empty-set) ...) ...) like (alpha (empty-set) ...) as both are stopping states?
[06:36:58] <hayley> CADR 2-0 Unix
[06:37:15] <gilberth> hayley, I have no clue.
[06:37:40] <gilberth> hayley: I could port UNIX to the CADR, when very bored and insane.
[06:37:48] <hayley> Ouch.
[06:38:39] <hayley> But I found it isn't obviously wrong (all my tests still work), and it cuts the RE size in half. Wonder if SBCL still complains about unreachable code.
[06:39:05] <gilberth> alpha is your history? Are you sure that its RHS will eventually be accepting?
[06:39:58] <hayley> Yes, I still use the alpha name. And, in a grep vector, I am confident that if it is stopping, a vector containing a stopping state is stopping.
[06:40:13] <gilberth> Or otherwise: It's your latched grep match? Then you could prun the RHS of the alternative. In fact IIRC my grep operator works that way.
[06:40:39] <hayley> Right, alpha is used to latch onto the last matching variables.
[06:40:42] <gilberth> By stopping you mean accepting, or what? Could also jam.
[06:40:56] <hayley> Accepting, right.
[06:41:16] <gilberth> Don't be too creative with your language, young lady.
[06:41:33] <gilberth> But, yes, I believe that makes perfect sense.
[06:41:47] <hayley> I have RE-STOPPED-P and RE-EMPTY-P, and now I don't remember why I have both.
[06:41:49] <hayley> Okay, thanks.
[06:42:35] <gilberth> Oh, non-blocking I/O and a select(2) loop, and automata for the connections because of partial reads. Joy!
[06:43:52] <gilberth> And listen(2)ing in between. A server.
[06:43:53] <hayley> So now my DFA only uses 18 states (but still too many variables).
[06:45:47] <gilberth> The other night I experienced that my overly complicated definition of a grep operator leads to less states than your elegant definition. There must be a reason why I did it that way, I forgot why.
[06:47:35] <hayley> I only checked the paper for alpha/history and grep. So you wrote the elegant version :)
[06:49:35] <gilberth> [Technically an automaton doesn't stop when "matching", it just happens to be at an accepting state. You could say it stops, when jamming, but also this is not correct as the jam or fail state is just some state where there is no escape to any accepting no matter what future input.]

[09:06:15] <hayley> Maybe I don't write enough kinds of programs, but I'm sorta convinced that types like [0, 65536) are only useful for cryptography and bit diddling (the former is a non-invertible kind of the latter).

[09:07:54] <gilberth> ] rather
[09:08:11] <hayley> Guess I should shut up and re^2ad the statistics class notes. One of the exercises went like "Does this look like a normal distribution?" "Not really, no." "Okay, now that we have confirmed that both are close enough to normal distributions..."
[09:10:15] <hayley> Oh, they decided to change the feature we were looking at out of the blue. That explains things.
[09:10:24] <gilberth> Well, the original definition of 'int' was "what ever your word width is". It ought to be 64-bit on AMD64 by that definition.
[09:10:48] <gilberth> So, yes, that's about hardware.
[09:10:52] <hayley> gilberth: Going to ask Intel for AVX-648 (18 * 18 * 2)
[09:11:52] <gilberth> 2*22*22?
[09:12:46] <gilberth> And 'int' is indeed of different size on different machines.
[09:13:30] <mfiano> The reasoning was "de-" denotes a reversal of action, and "un-" can denote either that or the absense of a state.
[09:13:47] <mfiano> "This is why it's convention in programming to call an object that hasn't been 'initialised' as 'uninitialised', not 'deinitialised'. This implies it was never initialised to begin with, so its initial state is 'uninitialised'. If its initial state was called 'deinitialised' it would give the false impression that it was previously initialised."
[09:14:12] <hayley> Interesting. Never heard of that before, but it makes sense.
[09:14:52] <mfiano> Of coure natlangs are not very formal. You can't really desubscribe something :)
[09:15:23] <hayley> Now what is this shit, they compute the standard error to three decimal places for one question, then copy those three decimal places for the next question‽ Who knows how many decimal places of accuracy you really have now.
[09:15:24] <gilberth> However, when you foo an unfooed object, you get a fooed object, which could be unfooed again.
[09:15:48] <hayley> They print out some values with 5 significant figures, which means their answer is probably categorically wrong.
[09:17:41] <hayley> And, eugh, they write != even when TeXing the equations.
[09:18:22] <gilberth> Like 9! = 0?
[09:18:41] <hayley> Like H_0: \mu != 0
[09:18:54] <hayley> They could have written H_0: \mu \neq 0
[09:19:03] <gilberth> So the factorial of \mu is zero?
[09:19:29] <hayley> I'll mention it next time.

But at least the processes don't block each other anymore.

[10:25:18] <hayley> Huh, the Pauseless GC still uses a bitmap for mark bits. I thought they'd steal a bit from the object header.

[10:47:43] <hayley> "Generation scavenging relies on software to keep track of references to epheremal objects. This is practical for Berkeley Smalltalk because it is an interpreter that executes only 9000 Smalltalk operations per second."
[10:52:20] <hayley> FWIW the Pauseless collector has sort-of pauses where, if one thread does something bad at a bad time, it has to wait a bit. Say, if a thread flipped to tospace and sees a fromspace reference, it has to wait for other threads to flip before it can be corrected. My collector has something similar for weak references.
[10:53:23] <hayley> OTOH for weak reference processing, I'm pretty sure you could wait out until every thread decides to stop reading through weak references, and then you would have a clean snapshot to kill off references with.

[14:07:45] <selwyn> return to farthings
[14:07:50] <Gnuxie> to solve the fuel crisis you can just heat the fuel up a bit 
[14:07:55] <Gnuxie> or something like that

[14:08:44] <selwyn> they said the whole thing would be over by now
[14:08:48] <Gnuxie> lol
[14:08:58] <selwyn> shka: well that was a depressing read. don´t you support anyone then

[14:09:28] <selwyn> well
[14:09:59] <selwyn> if christmas is ruined, then it will be harder to blame peoples behaviour for the crisis
[14:10:06] <shka> selwyn: i kinda support the left
[14:10:33] <selwyn> don´t see how you can blame people for ¨panic-buying¨ whole turkeys the way they did for fuel
[14:10:40] <shka> mostly because balance is so tilted to the conservative side
[14:10:41] <Gnuxie> they're already blaming businesses for not preparing 
[14:10:42] <hayley> There's "i kinda support the left" centrist and there's "i kinda support the left" postie mode

[14:14:47] <shka> because there are "liberals" that would be considered to be conservative by any other country standar
[14:14:53] <selwyn> i mean, i wouldn´t be able to identify them from that reddit post
[14:15:02] <selwyn> i would call them ´big city liberals´

[14:15:11] <selwyn> warsaw liberals
[14:15:18] <shka> ok, got it
[14:16:06] <selwyn> afaict their error is that they view themselves as presiding over a vast conservative hinterland

[14:18:45] <selwyn> yes
[14:19:20] <selwyn> uh
[14:19:37] <shka> in fact, maybe opposite is true
[14:19:38] <selwyn> well, i meant religious conservative, with all that entails
[14:20:32] <shka> well, then why the fuck they call themselves "liberal"
[14:20:59] <shka> regardless, i thought you meat the "egocentric liberal"

[14:21:39] <selwyn> i am talking about those guys

[14:27:31] <shka> hayley: not gonna happen, i read this like 10 years ago 
[14:27:50] <hayley> I thought you were complaining about Ayn Rand
[14:28:06] <shka> yes, because i have the same problem with her as well
[14:28:27] <shka> they have a very distinct vision of how world functions
[14:28:33] <Gnuxie> damn shka is ahead of all the zoomer internet leftists 
[14:28:37] <shka> and it is, simply put, false
[14:28:46] <hayley> ...but Stirner is about as un-objectivist as you get.
[14:28:57] <shka> Gnuxie: being edgy teenager before it was cool helps in that regard
[14:29:16] <hayley> "My affair is neither the divine nor the human; it is not the good, the true, the just, the free, etc., but only my own, and it is not general, but is—unique, as I am unique."
[14:29:37] <shka> hayley: this is a destructive idea
[14:29:55] <shka> you won't achieve anything with it
[14:30:07] <shka> well, IMHO
[14:30:10] <shka> obviously
[14:30:18] <shka> you can have different opinion
[14:30:59] <shka> thing is, the society is changed by people who acknowledge that they are not unique 
[14:31:06] <shka> it is called POLITICS
[14:32:50] <shka> in fact, if you want to eliminate all ability to change, you ought to convince everyone that they are unique
[14:33:07] <hayley> Relating to someone and knowing oneself as unique are orthogonal though. I mean, even now you don't vote for people based on their personal preferences, but they certainly have them, and they're unique like that...
[14:33:48] <shka> sure, and i don't care about that
[14:34:10] <selwyn> hm
[14:35:10] <hayley> OTOH voting for people, rather than ideas perhaps, means the people can't change awfully much without pissing everyone off. And the people who vote don't change, lest they piss each other off and split the party or something.
[14:35:11] <shka> anyway, all i have to say about that is that i subscribe to the adam curtis in this regard

[14:35:16] -ixelp- The Century of the Self - Part 1: "Happiness Machines" - YouTube
[14:37:56] <hayley> Providing people with a reification of some arbitrary position in the infinitely large space of ideas, in the political party, leadership and other apparatus, gives them an "ideal" that they will feel very challenged to avoid. Hence either everyone moves in one direction, or nobody does. And I would expect the latter as thought progresses basically by Brownian motion.
[14:39:54] <hayley> (Hence in TPoPOS I claim that the lack of organisation in open source is better than having gated "cooperatives" and all that shit.)
[14:43:55] <selwyn> i like curtis but draw a different conclusion
[14:46:33] <selwyn> democratic politicians used to be able to self-confidently defy public opinion to do things

[15:54:36] <shka> selwyn: well, from my point of view the idea of uniqueness lead to the practicality of isolation

[17:47:44] <shka> but it is a new thing
[17:48:19] <shka> and it is more about boosting satellites so they won't burn in the atmosphere  
[17:49:01] <shka> but ion thruster is an ion thruster so the same approach can be used to change orbit if you really need to
[17:49:37] <shka> arguably, limited use case though

[17:53:30] <shka> selwyn: there was mission recently with vessel that attached to satellite in orbit and boosted it's orbit
[17:53:31] <selwyn> perhaps the wallace and gromit vending machine on the moon can try this

[18:28:18] <Catie> Good morning
[18:29:33] <gilberth> I wonder if that damn FILE.c ever worked.
[18:31:25] <Alfr> Hello gilberth.
[18:31:34] <gilberth> Or the so called NCP rather. I need to read up on the protocol details and figure out what happens.
[18:33:30] <gilberth> It begins with that in an attempt to be helpful the CADR simulator does queue up incoming packets, which may be a bad thing.
[18:35:34] <gilberth> It's just that flow control does not kick in. Maybe it just worked because both the FILE server and the CADR were of similar speeds initially and hitting a real disk.
[18:41:47] <gilberth> Could be other issues, too. The Chaosnet as at 4Mbps, while the simulated ether is at practically infinite speed as seen by the CADR.

[18:53:55] <gilberth> FILE.c itself is probably fine.
[18:59:18] <gilberth> What's the de facto standard portable socket library for CL?
[18:59:33] <shka> usocket
[18:59:49] <Catie> usocket is the only one I've ever used
[19:00:36] <gilberth> Ok. I never bothered as I am fine with what CCL has, but for being used by others, I rather use usocket then. Thanks.
[19:01:09] <gilberth> I suppose it is a layer above that damn BSD API? As I may want to deal with UNIX domain sockets.
[19:01:54] <selwyn> remind me what you are working on gilberth
[19:02:40] <Catie> ehhh maybe half a layer above? It's definitely easier to work with in CL than it is in C, but usocket is a pretty thin layer over BSD sockets
[19:02:52] <gilberth> I got carried away with the CADR simulator. At first I just wanted to make the emulated console fast and low latency, now I want a Chaosnet, on a stick! And quick.

[19:52:10] <pjb> and then, we'll need an IP-Chaosnet gateway.
[19:56:14] <gilberth> Well, some use UDP for transporting Chaosnet packets. The only trouble is broadcast packets to a subnet.
[19:59:58] <gilberth> Addresses in Chaosnet are scarce, there are only 256 subnets of 256 hosts each. But when you keep a table mapping from a Chaosnet address to an IP address, port pair, you should be fine.
[20:01:11] <gilberth> And there is no such thing as a name service, so to have a network you would need to keep a hosts lists anyway.
[20:01:53] <pjb> gilberth: gateways, not routers.   Ie. you will have a process that has both an IP address and a Chaosnet address, and that will answer to app-level requests (ftp, web, telnet, etc), and forward them to the chaosnet servers.
[20:02:22] <pjb> gilberth: of course, if you want to connect two remote CADR, a chaosnet VPN over IP would be nice.
[20:04:22] <gilberth> Well, it's a question on which level you do the embedding. On Chaosnet hosts or on chaosnet services?

[20:11:39] <gilberth> The Chaosnet AIM is not that explicit about different layers, but basically a host would transmit a packet on the ether with a destination host address (subnet, host pair) and bridges between subnets would pick that up to route the packet to another subnet. I believe we could skip the routing part and leave that to IP.
[20:11:51] <pjb> Routing between IP and Chaosnet could involve a NAT. In that case, I have a telnet implementation in CL ;-)

[20:20:20] <gilberth> A table could also be maintained by a community. There could be an entry for mapping say chaosnet host named "bauhh" at address 7421 to bauhh.dyndns.org:7421. A CADR needs a host table anyway, as there is no name service on Chaosnet.

[20:21:51] <gilberth> IP provides for more, there is a protocol number for Chaosnet and one could use DNS to recover Chaosnet hosts, but I am aiming on sth which is hassle free with a high rate of working for a casual curious guy.
[20:24:33] <gilberth> But that would be very nice, people could host all kind of emulated machines and say "To play with my PDP-10, SUPDUP to host 509 [mapped to my-pdp10.chaosnetguy.org:509/UDP. A host mapping could be maintained on github e.g.

[21:09:44] <shka> selwyn: yeah, like the assumption that nuclear power plant will produce horrific amounts of waste that will have to be stored for thousands of years 
[21:10:43] <shka> they get that number by treating everything contaminated (including gloves used for handling fuel) as the real bad stuff (tm) 
[21:10:48] <selwyn> oh
[21:11:09] <selwyn> that´s what police do when they do a drug bust lol to make it look bigger than it was

[21:13:51] <shka> i think that they are dummies
[21:14:54] <selwyn> what do you think about the nuclear waste repo in finland?
[21:15:13] <shka> good job Finland!
[21:15:16] <shka> that's what i think
[21:15:45] <pjb> selwyn: there is no nuclear waste. Only elements full of nuclear energy remaining to be taped.
[21:16:15] <shka> i also think that it is a little bit wasteful, but hey, it solves problem here and there 
[21:16:24] <shka> and Finland is now SET
[21:16:40] <shka> waste storage is a done thing there 
[21:16:40] <pjb> Basically, the problem is that we currently use a solid-state technology. As soon as we can switch to liquid state (molten salt), we'll be able to "burn" much more completely this fuel.
[21:17:11] <pjb> And the waste of nuclear materials is microscopic compared to the wast of coal or oil!
[21:17:21] <shka> uh, you can build a solid state breeder reactor
[21:17:25] <shka> no problem
[21:17:29] <pjb> (including CO2 and other nefarious gases).

[21:17:44] <shka> molten salt has other advantages 
[21:17:48] <shka> (and problems)
[21:18:14] <pjb> shka: yes, it would still have a discrete cycle.  With liquid, you can have continuous cycles.    (/me being naive there).

[21:19:12] <shka> for instance, the nautilus was refueled how often? 
[21:19:21] <shka> multiple times a year IIRC
[21:19:46] <shka> and the current trend is the small modular reactor anyway
[21:20:09] <shka> where you simply replace the whole reactor module instead of refueling 
[21:21:04] <shka> the main point of the molten salt reactor is safety
[21:21:18] <shka> it is a low pressure design
[21:21:24] <shka> and can be efficient too!
[21:21:45] <shka> because salt is hot enough that you can run the normal kind of steam turbines
[21:22:28] <selwyn> as opposed to the abnormal kind?
[21:23:00] <selwyn> i wonder which long term safety messages finland will choose
[21:23:01] <shka> selwyn: nuclear power plant turbines run with like 200 degrees steam
[21:23:05] <selwyn> > Sending this message was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture. 
[21:23:22] <shka> anyway, the main cost of nuclear is the safety
[21:23:28] <selwyn> yes
[21:23:49] <shka> so having inherently safer design, like molten salt reduces the main cost  
[21:23:55] <shka> that's why they are trending 
[21:24:30] <shka> oh, btw, those nuclear power plant turbines
[21:24:46] <shka> very specialized equipment, also comes with a high price tag

[21:26:28] <shka> well, unless you go to SPACE

[21:28:20] <selwyn> fair enough
[21:28:59] <pjb> Progress is made on the fusion side with better supraconductors and magnetic fields.  Similarly some progress is made with molten salt fission reactors.
[21:29:09] <shka> i think that nuclear will be accepted as the most eco-friendly power source
[21:29:20] <selwyn> it strikes me that there is a lot of, for want of a better word, macho international politics around nuclear
[21:29:23] <pjb> The problem is that we're spending resources on idiocies, like the covid and "renewable" energy.

[21:31:30] <selwyn> i wonder if there can be some kind of play where the eu decides to go all out on nuclear as the only way of getting close to energy independence from russia
[21:31:36] <pjb> Well, China is starting (at least officially) to slow down on coal. Hence the production problem the're having, and the inflation we're beginning to have.
[21:31:59] <selwyn> their move away from coal seems to be earnest and very real 
[21:32:27] <pjb> selwyn: well, to have that you would have to have a renaissance of Europe, ie. you would need all young Europeans to start making a lot of babies.
[21:32:43] <selwyn> what does the birth rate have to do with energy policy
[21:32:53] <shka> i think that going all out nuclear would be possible, but it pains me to think that most of this technology would be imported from elsewhere 
[21:32:59] <pjb> Then some optimism and volountarism, and planning for the future would be possible.
[21:33:13] <pjb> selwyn: when half the head of states in the EU don't have children, they don't care about the future!
[21:33:20] <shka> because European nuclear energy, is, frankly, not the most modern
[21:33:20] <selwyn> oh right
[21:34:00] <pjb> shka: that's also a problem, it has been left decaying, so we're losing the know-how.  We need young people to study it again and rebuild an industry in Europe.
[21:34:19] <shka> i hate to agree with you pjb

[21:38:27] <shka> from the the graph https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_France it looks like they are just adding more renewable, stopping fossil and keeping nuclear operational
[21:38:37] <shka> but what about the R&D?

[21:40:56] <pjb> We've closed a few nuclear power plants on the request of Germany…

[22:23:55] <pl> current public hypothesis with best basis is borked configuration pushed by automation with possibly unknown dependence for revertion that was broken by said configuration change
[22:23:56] <shka> pl: i am just wondering why it can't come online 
[22:24:09] <pl> shka: from what I found, it's a logistical problem

[22:24:24] *** Quits: ec (~ec@gateway/tor-sasl/ec) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[22:24:50] <pl> There are people who know how to fix it, there are people who know how to authenticate themselves to necessary systems, and people who can physically reach those systems.
[22:24:55] <pl> All three are required to fix.
[22:25:05] <pl> But all those three sets are non-overlapping :D

[22:36:40] <pl> shka: apparently with FB ASNs completely down, the people on the ground floor in DCs can't authorize to get access to routers
[22:39:16] <X-Scale> >As many of you know, DNS for FB services has been affected and this is likely a symptom of the actual issue, and that's that BGP peering with Facebook peering routers has gone down, very likely due to a configuration change that went into effect shortly before the outages happened (started roughly 1540 UTC).
[22:39:20] <X-Scale> >There are people now trying to gain access to the peering routers to implement fixes, but the people with physical access is separate from the people with knowledge of how to actually authenticate to the systems and people who know what to actually do, so there is now a logistical challenge with getting all that knowledge unified.
[22:39:45] <X-Scale> >Part of this is also due to lower staffing in data centers due to pandemic measures.
[22:40:27] <pl> so, their domain registrar is also down (they own one and use them)
[22:40:31] <pl> thus the DNS
[22:41:49] <pl> I... don't think there's enough popcorn where I am
[22:43:46] <X-Scale> imho the world will be much better place if they never come back
[22:44:03] <X-Scale> history books: facebook died in a horrible bgp fire
[22:47:08] <shka> pl: perhaps it was a hack
[22:47:30] <pl> shka: they supposedly managed to trace it to their own change
[22:47:37] <pl> there's possibility it was a hack, but it's not that big

[22:59:12] <shka> IoT doors?
[22:59:17] <shka> the fuck dudes
[23:01:45] <sm2n> it's pretty funny
[23:03:21] <pl> shka: it's pretty common
[23:03:26] <shka> yeah, but you wouldn't want to be in the skin of those devops
[23:03:34] <pl> the doors are failsafe, so people can escape
[23:03:35] <shka> it is gonna be a wild night xD
[23:03:41] <pl> but finding the rare physical key is going to be hard
[23:04:02] <shka> yeah, i mean, it is only a software failure
[23:04:18] <shka> imagine what would happen if there was a fire in the building
[23:04:22] <shka> like
[23:04:25] <shka> right now
[23:05:01] <shka> it wouldn't be pretty 
[23:05:27] <pl> shka: that's why the doors are fail-safe
[23:05:38] <pl> which means you can escape the building when the badge system is down
[23:05:40] <shka> also, why close the conference rooms  
[23:05:45] <pl> but you can't enter them
[23:06:09] <pl> it doesn't have to be conference rooms, it could be plain problem of "we can't enter the office floor"
[23:06:27] <pl> as corridors usually are separated with badge readers
[23:06:32] <shka> right
[23:06:48] <pjb> https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1445068170038059011  FB, GOOG and AMZN too.
[23:07:10] <shka> no fucking way

[23:09:43] <shka> pl: so it is any old school FPS game now
[23:09:53] <shka> mission: enter the office floor level
[23:10:00] <pl> shka: it's Doom 1 "find the key", yeah
[23:10:24] <pl> sm2n: main websites of what?
[23:10:24] <shka> i was thinking of build engine game, like duke nuken
[23:10:32] <shka> pl: google, amazon
[23:10:36] <sm2n> ^
[23:10:43] <pl> sm2n: it's facebook that went down
[23:10:51] <pl> as in all that FB touches
[23:11:10] <sm2n> yes but pjb is claiming google and amazon (aws?) too
[23:11:47] <pl> Google is having ridiculously increased load on some of their services (especially DNS resolver), Twitter is having load-driven failures at times
[23:11:56] <pl> because of people hammering it due to FB being down :D

[23:12:15] <pl> AWS had something probably minor in routing related to certain networks
[23:12:19] <sm2n> huh
[23:12:56] *** Joins: ec (~ec@gateway/tor-sasl/ec)
[23:13:05] <pl> so I've seen conflicting reports on AWS being "down" for people on T-Mobile USA networks
[23:18:38] <Psybur> ive been using youtube all day, no issues
[23:21:22] <pjb> there are only two big cloud providers, aws and google. So if aws is down, more than half the Internet is down.
[23:21:39] <pjb> Apple iCloud is on aws IIRC.
