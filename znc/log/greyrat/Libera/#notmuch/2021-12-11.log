[00:49:43] <jrm> Upgrading the FreeBSD notmuch packages 0.34.2.  Is there a pending NEWS entry?  If so, I can wait to commit.  If nothing is planned, I'll just scan the logs.
[00:50:20] <jrm> These are the packages we have: https://www.freshports.org/search.php?query=notmuch&search=go&num=10&stype=name&method=match&deleted=excludedeleted&start=1&casesensitivity=caseinsensitive

[01:33:10] <pazz> Apologies for the politics. It'd just make my day to know that he uses notmuch to participate in the circus

[02:04:46] <jrm> I can neither confirm nor deny this statement.
[02:06:05] <jrm> Kidding of course.  I am certainly not a politician.
[02:08:03] <pazz> :)
[02:21:26] <bremner> jrm: there should be an entry for 0.34.2 in NEWS
[02:22:27] <jrm> bremner: Didn't see anything in https://git.notmuchmail.org/git?p=notmuch;a=blob_plain;f=NEWS;hb=HEAD
[02:22:52] <bremner> ah right, I didn't merge the tag back to master. One sec
[02:24:45] <bremner> jrm: ok, try again
[02:25:00] <jrm> Looks good.  Thank you.
[02:25:04] <bremner> jrm: just to be clear HEAD doesn't correspond the release
[02:25:17] <bremner> there's a tag 0.34.2
[02:25:33] <bremner> dunno what you package from, the tarballs?
[02:26:53] <jrm> Yes.  https://notmuchmail.org/releases/
[02:27:14] <bremner> ok, then the git organization is not so important
[02:29:33] <bremner> ah, I see the various add-on packages are maintained by a different person. I guess as long as you are ahead that should be OK
[02:29:55] <bremner> sometimes notmuch-emacs requires a new-ish notmuch
