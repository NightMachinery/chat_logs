[01:28:07] <GuiToris> it's just as well she doesn't pronounce it with sh
[01:28:42] <GuiToris> I met a lot of British people, and I realize I don't understand that accent
[01:28:59] <GuiToris> I mean I met them today
[01:29:40] <GuiToris> 'Do you have a facemask with you'  is this good?
[01:29:55] <GuiToris> isn't it 'on you' ?
[01:31:21] <blkshp> Either would be fine. I think in the UK we'd more say "on you" but part of me thinks the US would say 'with you'. Feel free to correct me Americans.
[01:31:38] <blkshp> British, as we've discussed has many thousands of distinguishable accents.

[13:19:07] <brigand> Hello. Is this true? https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/off_of#Usage_notes "The use of off of as a preposition is now considered tautological or incorrect by some usage guides and is not suitable for formal or business use."
[13:20:17] <brigand> Looks like an "americanisation".
[13:31:27] *** Joins: paul424 (~tom@ip-5-172-234-126.multi.internet.cyfrowypolsat.pl)
[13:31:44] <Maxdamantus> Are you asking if it actually should be considered tautological or bad, or if style guides consider it to be bad?
[13:32:11] <Maxdamantus> It doesn't seem like an Americanism to me.
[13:32:43] <Maxdamantus> and I think there are some places where I would very likely use "off of", eg, when talking about something making money off of something.-
[13:33:00] <Maxdamantus> someone making money off of something*
[13:33:44] <Maxdamantus> Replacing "off of" with "off" sounds weird there. It could be replaced with "from", but then it sounds too formal.

[17:55:41] <Hazey_Dream> Thanks for the suggestions, TimMc.
[17:57:22] <Hazey_Dream> Reason I asked is I'm pondering if there's a good word to use for contexts like "If you're swimming & your feet can't touch the [WORD FOR THE FLOOR/BOTTOM OF THE BODY OF WATER GOES HERE], you should be careful.".
[17:59:23] <Hazey_Dream> Though Wiktionary defines "streambed" as "A channel through which a stream flows or used to flow.", so I don't think that term is fitting/related to what I'm thinking of TimMc.
[17:59:55] <Hazey_Dream> A little surprising to me, though, considering "bed" is in the term.
[18:00:53] <Hazey_Dream> & lakebed is defined by Wiktionary as: "The bottom of a lake, especially after the lake has gone dry.".
[18:01:16] <Hazey_Dream> Though I do wonder if it is more common to use lakebed when referring to the location with or without water.
[18:12:56] *** Joins: xx (~xx@user/xx)
[18:17:32] <TimMc> Hazey_Dream: Oh, just use "the bottom".
[18:17:45] <TimMc> That's clear enough in the context of swimming.

[23:19:49] <qurn> Hmm.  Even in myself, I have seen too much effort on the "process" portion of several projects and initiatives.
[23:20:02] <qurn> E.g. needlesly putting everything at work into kanban boards and marching them along. Setting up a shared to-do list with a friend to coordinate shared projects.
[23:20:27] <qurn> Anyone know concise phrase or word to capture this concept?
[23:23:18] <qurn> "the process we're using is overwrought" or " we're bikeshedding our workflow itself" or, eeeeeh… "this has become productivity-porn"?  So many books, etc. on productivity, I suppose I'm hoping this is a well-established problem with a name.

[23:38:39] <TimMc> Perhaps "we're getting a little process-bound" or you might invoke red tape, overcomplication, etc.
[23:40:24] <qurn> Yeah, it's in line with many famailar things; "meetings that should have been an email," yakshaving, https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/when_you%27re_up_to_your_neck_in_alligators,_it%27s_hard_to_remember_that_your_initial_objective_was_to_drain_the_swamp
[23:41:19] <qurn> Guess not everything needs its own single word.
