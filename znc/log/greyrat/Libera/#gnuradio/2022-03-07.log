[14:08:42] <muaddib[m]> A different way would be to send the vector out of a ZMQ pub socket. You can ingest the stream there continuously. Otherwise, you’ll need to periodically poll the signal probe, which is ok for some applications, but if you need all the data a ZMQ socket is best.
[14:08:42] <muaddib[m]> This is a fantastic reference for that. It includes code to ingest the numpy array and you can work with it from there.
