[07:10:52] <kronk> I love it when I start a complex deployment and nearly all of AWS grinds to a standstill.
[07:12:21] <kronk> anybody that has anything deployed in IAD, there's an increase in latency.
[07:12:31] <kronk> putting it mildly, this deploy has taken a fucking hour+.
[07:18:47] <gwozniak> We are being encouraged to put our build on the Jenkins infra at work that uses AWS
[07:19:04] <gwozniak> I don't mind, but I have to wonder how much it's going to cost
[08:35:08] <kronk> it'll hurt.

[18:35:20] <gwozniak> I was looking at a function for a while, trying to figure out how it was exiting when it didn't return anything.  Turns out it was the code writing a message that does it

[18:44:42] <gwozniak> ouch
[18:45:53] <ngoldbaum> sanctions compliance is no joke, sadly
[19:04:46] <defect> are there those kinds of industry wide sanction?
[19:34:40] <Brekkjern> It's kinda lame that Oracle has decided not to sell their products in Russia though. No way the Russian economy would survive for more than a few more days if they kept selling their DB.
