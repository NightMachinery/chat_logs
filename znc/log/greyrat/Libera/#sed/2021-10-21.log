[03:34:27] <pabs3> how do I match from one line to but not including another line? so far I resort to head: LANG=C apt-cache show sed | sed -n '/^Description-en: */,/^[^ ]/p' | head -n -1

[03:46:20] <emanuele6> pabs3: one way is: /pat1/,/pat2/ { /pat2/! p }
[03:49:52] <emanuele6> by the way, /^Description-en: */ is equivalent to /^Description-en:/

[03:56:32] <emanuele6> or: sed -n '/^Description-en:/,/^[^ ]/ { /^ / p }'
[03:57:16] <emanuele6> now that i think about it that only works if /pat2/ doesn't match /pat1/ oops
[04:07:30] *** Quits: earnestly (~earnest@user/earnestly) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[04:16:55] <emanuele6> you can use: sed -n -e '/^Description-en:/,/^[^ ]/ H' -e '$ {g; s/^[^\n]*\'$'\n''\(.*\)\'$'\n''.*$/\1/p}'
[04:17:30] <emanuele6> but i think this can't be made portable because of the [^\n]; '[^\'$'\n'']' is not accepted
[04:18:39] <emanuele6> maybe there is a smarter way to remove the first line from the pattern space, i haven't used hold space stuff in a while
[04:20:05] <emanuele6> ah, D, duh
[04:22:08] <emanuele6> mmm, doesn't work. i think D gets it stuck in an infinite loop
[04:22:50] <emanuele6> ah
[04:23:07] <emanuele6> D restarts the cycle, it does not just delete up to the first newline

[12:56:29] <f0xb4t> could you tell mi why sed info lists command
[12:57:00] <f0xb4t> GNU 'I' only in section of 'the s command' ?
[12:57:54] <Soliton> that's not a command but a flag for the s command.
[12:58:18] <f0xb4t> sure but I can use it also with pattern matching
[12:58:40] <f0xb4t> i.e.: sed -ne '/this/Ip' myfavouritefile
[13:00:23] <Soliton> that's documented under "Regexp Addresses".
[13:00:55] <Soliton> still not a command. the command there is p.
[13:01:26] <Soliton> granted that's a pretty confusing extension.
[13:02:30] <f0xb4t> can't see such a section there
[13:03:07] <f0xb4t>    The `s' command can be followed by zero or more of the following
[13:03:08] <f0xb4t> FLAGS:
[13:03:27] <f0xb4t> this is the paragraph where is is located under s command
[13:04:05] <f0xb4t> they call it as a 'flag', you're right
[13:04:09] <Soliton> go to "sed addresses" then "Regexp Addresses".
[13:05:51] <f0xb4t> in Menu or detailed node listing?
[13:06:01] <Soliton> info sed 'sed addresses' 'Regexp Addresses'  works for me.
[13:08:06] <Soliton> https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/html_node/Regexp-Addresses.html
[13:08:41] <Soliton> if ever an I command is added that's going to be trouble for GNU sed.
[13:11:06] <f0xb4t> I don't expect that ;p
[13:11:46] <f0xb4t> maybe when they will extend posix/xpg
[13:12:56] <Soliton> indeed but since that is presumably in large part influenced by GNU sed for one it is certainly quite unlikely.
[13:13:58] <f0xb4t> well, GNU I is in use for quite long time already, then it is proven solution and should be adopted as a part of the standard
[13:14:40] <Soliton> that is how posix works. stuff in it is based on existing implementations.
[13:15:31] <Soliton> there is going to be -E in the next version for example since a lot of sed variants already have it.
[13:16:49] <f0xb4t> you mean ERE ?
[13:17:09] <Soliton> that option tells sed to use ERE, yes.
[13:18:25] <Soliton> https://www.austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=528
[13:36:16] <f0xb4t> hmm, I use sed 4.2.2 on CentOS 7.9 and have only -r for ERE
