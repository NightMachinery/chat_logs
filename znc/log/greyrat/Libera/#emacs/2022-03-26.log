[00:05:18] <gxt> Yes I know, but sometimes I want to "scroll" back and forth through the undo history a bit to check out how something was just a bit ago and when changing direction with C-g several times it takes forever to actually go further back than the zig-zag you created

[02:06:48] <artefact> GNU C style is by far my least favourite. but i'm not a fan of putting a space in if () and while () statements, as eg. in the kernel sources either
[02:06:56] <gxt> I love some of the ideas behind Unison (see this talk https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=gCWtkvDQ2ZI)
[02:07:35] <grym> i'm happiest when there exists 1. a singular formatting style for a particular project and 2. a mechanism to compel it automatically
[02:07:41] <grym> i don't actually care what that style *is*
[02:07:48] <grym> i just want it to Happen and i don't want to care about it
[02:07:58] <e1f> so basically, just display the file in my preferred indentation style
[02:08:25] <e1f> without modifying the underlying style
[02:08:43] <grym> i _think_ tree-sitter is starting to think about such things
[02:09:09] <e1f> pretty sure i suggested this idea about 10 years ago
[02:09:17] <artefact> i think tools like gofmt/rustfmt are good ideas
[02:09:28] <gxt> In short, Unison doesn't store code as the text, but as the AST with variable nodes just being IDs and the names you give them being stored separately. So refactoring is just a single change of the name for id#21341 and it automatically changes everywhere.

[02:10:04] <gxt> Also the code structure is hashed, so if you have two functions that have the same structure, but different variable names, they reference the same "code object" under the hood.
[02:10:19] <e1f> exactly
[02:10:24] <artefact> there's also the politeness of submitting pretty diffs
[02:10:30] <parsnip> artefact: i think the point of tree sitter over *fmt tools, is tree sitter intends to work even for incomplete syntax
[02:10:41] <gxt> That allows e.g. using the code from a library but renaming the variables trivially, while still allowing updating the underlying code.
[02:10:53] <parsnip> if you have "format on save" hook, and the file is not yet valid, the *fmt executables will just barf

[04:05:13] <hodapp> I already use it for saving notes and things from my phone, and it works great with Syncthing - except for the annoyance that I must manually tell it to sync with the local share Syncthing keeps up to date
