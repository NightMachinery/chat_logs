[20:55:33] <kylo252[m]> the alternative: get a list of open windows and prevent opening a new one if one already exists, but I'm not sure how you can make this behavior deterministic. 
[20:55:33] <kylo252[m]> best solution? maybe once a mirrored `on_cursor` float is implemented in core, it would open the other window mirrored

[20:58:07] <mahmoudajawad[m]> I'll read about that as I'm not aware of it. But, yes, I think your approach works here, like binding the cursor autocmd to a function that checks before calling hover. Anywhere I can read on how to determine if a window is currently open?
[21:01:53] <mjlbach[m]> You can read focus_id

[21:53:29] <bfredl> hmmmm
[21:54:09] <dmitmel[m]> also, does the vim.type_idx/vim.val_idx trickery work with mpack? can I force a number to be serialized an integer or float? and can a list be forced to be serialized as a dictionary?
[21:54:13] <bfredl> ok, the spec doesn't specify it.
[21:54:38] <bfredl> it's just our rpc implementation never uses it, but it is legal msgpack as such
[21:55:12] <bfredl> dmitmel[m]: at least the last question there is `vim.empty_dict()` to represent an empty dict
[21:56:09] <dmitmel[m]> I mean, for my purposes this is not an issue really, but if I were to use msgpack to interface with a, say, Rust program, than it could be more stricter on the deserialization side
