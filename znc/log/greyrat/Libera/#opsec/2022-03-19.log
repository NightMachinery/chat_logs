[00:01:15] <Joanna> I was just thinking about how there is a big similarity between the Ukrainian refugees and that immigrant caravan and immigrants flooding the us border. There is a concerted effort to destroy people’s countries and then flood other countries with refugees and then to portray  the refugees as an invasion of vermin. Another thing there seem to be many instances of national governments voluntarily letting in large numbers of refugees 
[00:01:15] <Joanna> and then dumping them into cities that are not reimbursed for taking care of them. It’s as if refugees are being generated and used as weapons to drag down prosperous countries towards poverty. Most people do not want to leave their original countries and are literally forced out.
[00:01:27] <JimBuntu> Cultures transcend national identity.  Also, just because someone comes from a lower tech community, let's say an Amazon forest native... that doesn't mean they aren't intelligent.  Some people are very stupid, and I'm not talking about the Amazon person either... I'm talking about racists and such.
[00:04:45] <Joanna> JimBuntu: there is a great effort being made to get control of any remaining wilderness with indigenous people on it and force them out. They use nature preserve or sustainable development as a pretext for this. It’s as if they want to erase all possibilities of people being able to fend for themselves.
[00:06:31] <Joanna> JimBuntu: most people are stupid because of their education. It’s not a deliberate behavior.
[00:08:21] <Joanna> Even if it seems like people could just think more , they really are incapable of thinking in certain ways because of how they were conditioned.

[02:06:17] <CalimeroTeknik> Joanna, I do stand behind the claim that Putin behaves like a monster, though a rather civilised one, and the SS who directly committed atrocities as well. In both cases I do contend as well that they were made into monsters by various mechanisms, but that doesn't change the fact! And I was of that opinion from years prior to current preoccupations
[02:07:22] <CalimeroTeknik> I'm sure that by some aspects I've become monstrous myself, but having little power keeps somewhat safe from corruption
[02:33:06] <Joanna> CalimeroTeknik: what makes someone a monster though ? It’s a matter of opinion really
[02:34:00] *** Quits: s1gyn (~s1gyn@user/s1gyn) (Quit: WeeChat 3.0.1)
[02:34:27] <CalimeroTeknik> I think so, yes
[02:34:58] <CalimeroTeknik> what I call a monster is a form of life that crushes other forms of life as part of personal choice of life
[02:35:20] <jan6> so every non-vegetarian? ;P
[02:35:29] <jan6> actually, vegetarians, too
[02:35:36] <jan6> plants are certainly lifeforms
[02:35:45] <CalimeroTeknik> I would have mentioned, if nobody did
[02:35:58] <CalimeroTeknik> it's not just predatory behaviour though
[02:36:18] <jan6> it depends on your definition of "crushes"
[02:36:44] <jan6> also you're probably missing "intentionally" in there
[02:36:44] <Joanna> Good and evil really is a matter of perspective. It’s good to understand the motivations of both sides. Nato wants to control everything and getting people killed in wars is fine with them. Russians want to stop nato from invading their country. Judging by how long it’s taking them they didn’t bomb it into oblivion to conquer it.

[02:37:20] <jan6> nato doesn't want to control everything, they don't, by far
[02:37:29] <jan6> just like russia doesn't control all social media
[02:37:52] <jan6> just like google can't prevent people from ending up at "illegal sites"
[02:38:06] <Joanna> There is a very long list of foreign meddling that goes back further than ww1

[02:39:04] <Joanna> Nope it’s a proxy war using useful expendable pawns

[02:39:34] <jan6> it's just a military agreement
[02:39:41] <Joanna> Tell that to people living in places they destroyed

[02:59:57] <CalimeroTeknik> monster=monstrous
[03:03:46] <Joanna> Monster as in monster truck :)
[03:03:53] <jessicara> think america has burned all it's trust among even western civilians
[03:04:00] <jessicara> so even if it's right this time no one will believe it
[03:04:09] <Joanna> Monstrosity is not a positive word though..
[03:04:56] <Joanna> America will happily sacrifice everyone. Like in that death note story
[03:05:42] <jessicara> happily sacrifice europe yeah, not so much itself
[03:07:49] <Joanna> They will happily kill their own citizens if necessary. Maybe America is still controlled by England just as Israel is
[03:08:17] <jessicara> england is a small country no one cares about
[03:08:28] <jessicara> control does the other way
[03:09:02] <Joanna> England is small but controls a lot just look at exchange rate for British pound
[03:09:58] <jessicara> depends on if it controls itself, or if its led around by it's greed by others
[03:11:41] <Joanna> British bankers backed hitler
[03:12:04] <Joanna> I bet they weren’t in London for his attacks

For those not familiar with death note , it’s an animae series where a guy finds a way to kill anyone he wants by writing their name and sets out on a righteous crusade to rid the world of bad people and as a result becomes a murderer and destroys the lives of everyone he knows and then dies disgracefully after being out smarted

[23:53:09] <Joanna> Hey suss I sent you a link
[23:58:37] <Joanna> Hi everyone I was watching a show about how the  coup in Ukraine played out. First it started as a fun street fair with free food to lure people in. After they got critical mass  of people they start blocking and taking things over. If police are sent to clear them out they act as martyrs and get killed and injured to further the coup. Sometimes they mix people who attack police in with the regular people who came there to cause 
[23:58:37] <Joanna> violence.
