[00:07:30] <quanticle> The difference between the tone of tech-press reviews of Teslas and normal automotive press reviews is stark.
[00:07:57] <quanticle> (Even though CNET is normally what I'd think of as "tech-press", this reads like a normie review)
[00:09:00] <gwern> yeah. I believe tesla will get there someday with the fit-and-finish and superhigh prices for everything and the self-driving thing... but I'm happy to let the tesla fans donate to tesla in the mean time

[00:15:20] <Robomot> Rob Henderson (@robkhenderson): "The smart people in the Soviet Union were the most supportive of communist ideology"
[00:15:37] <gwern> does tesla not even test water resistance or something? heck, don't they drive their cars through a carwash of their own or something?
[00:15:42] <gwern> quanticle: discussed last night
[00:15:45] <quanticle> Oh
[00:16:31] <ggreer> > On our Model Y this happens constantly, at least once an hour and sometimes much more often than that. In a single hour of driving I caught five phantom braking incidents on camera, two hard enough to sound the automatic emergency braking chime.
[00:16:33] <ggreer> what the hell?
[00:17:05] <quanticle> I don't think it's a problem with the design of the car, I think it's a problem with quality control. I was reading a review of a Tesla in Car and Driver the other day, and one thing that they highlighted were the inconsistent panel gaps. It's like Tesla's operating at where American automakers were at in the late-70s.
[00:17:28] <gwern> quanticle: I mean, if you can't manufacture a design adequately, that is arguably a design problem
[00:17:41] <quanticle> Not necessarily. It could also be a manufacturing process problem.
[00:17:47] <spxtr> given the same design, another company could manufacture it properly
[00:18:06] <quanticle> Yeah, c.f. the comparison between Japanese and American automakers in the late-'70s.
[00:18:30] <quanticle> The cars were actually very similiar, it's just a Toyota sedan would work and one from Detroit... wouldn't
[00:19:42] <gwern> sorta like arguing that your programmers can't write a C program without a dozen remote root exploits isn't a design flaw of C, it's just your programmers are insufficiently superhuman
[00:20:26] <quanticle> Or like... rust. I know you've spoken about how cars rust in Minnesota, but you know what: in my experience, it's just American cars. Chryslers are the worst. But you look at Toyotas and Hondas on the road here? Even ones that are more than a decade old? Not many with visible rust.
[00:20:40] <ggreer> I've never had water in my frunk. my main complaint is that changing the air filter is super tricky, so I'm like "fuck it" and pay tesla service to do it
[00:22:04] <ggreer> I guess I got lucky or something because there's no real seal in the frunk part

[00:25:07] <ggreer> oh there's a big rubber gasket around the frunk that I never noticed
[00:25:38] <ggreer> that helps explain the lack of water
[00:25:42] <gwern> that's how my old saturn and buick trunks worked too, just have a rubber thingy running all aorund it. it's not hard. tesla just apparently doesn't get it right
[00:25:42] <quanticle> I'm not sure the programming analogy holds. The reason that people say that C is a flawed language is because basically *nobody* can write a safe program in it. But imagine if there were two companies, both using the same programming language. One puts out correct programs which don't crash and are free of security flaws. The other puts out programs which do crash and are riddled with flaws.
[00:25:44] <quanticle> Would you claim that the problem is with the programming language?
[00:26:46] <gwern> quanticle: but there are people who write C programs which aren't clusterfucks. like dan, or the shuttle folks. it's not easy but it is doable. the problem is if you are deluded enough to think that either (a) you are them (hint: no one is them except them), or (b) history will somehow never repeat itself as the eschaton is immanetized and we program flawless C in the New Jerusalem
[00:27:33] <quanticle> So... in this case the problem is that Tesla thinks it can achieve the same level of quality as Toyota?
[00:28:13] <gwern> so I would argue. they have to know they're incompetent and they are designing like they are competent. which is adorable but they should stick to the little-boy designs and let the grownups talk
[00:28:30] <ggreer> if it's more likely in teslas than other brands, it could definitely be due to poor tolerances in manufacturing/assembly
[00:28:53] <gwern> it's sorta like how the genius of the ak-47 is that it knows it's the ak-47 and not some space-age lasgun
[00:28:54] <ggreer> IIRC musk has complained that he got the tolerances wrong in the past. he thought millimeter accuracy would be good enough, but errors accumulate so you need tighter specs
[00:29:03] *** Quits: oxide (~lambda@user/oxide) (Quit: oxide)
[00:29:45] <quanticle> Perhaps, but at the same time, Detroit automakers just got good
[00:30:03] <quanticle> At this point, a Ford or a GM is probably just as good as a Toyota
[00:30:07] <ggreer> also IIRC this is only a problem in the california factory. chinese made teslas have excellent quality
[00:30:44] <gwern> so design the ak-47 of teslas for the california factory until they git gud
[00:30:48] <quanticle> It's not like Ford redesigned its cars to reflect the fact that its factories have lower quality control standards. 
[00:30:57] <gwern> I'm sure they did just that
[00:31:14] <ggreer> ford just became a global conglomerate like toyota. they manufacture a bunch of stuff outside the US
[00:31:30] <ggreer> final assembly tends to be in the US to get around tariffs
[00:31:53] <quanticle> Right and the problems that I'm talking about (panel gaps, poor seals) are problems of final assembly
[00:32:05] <Khoth> Although if Tesla can't manufacture cars as well as other manufacturers, it seems implausible to demand that they make up for it by being much better at designing cars than anyone else to make up for their shitty manufacturing
[00:32:08] <gwern> everytime you loosen the tolerances or add some safety factor or use a simpler process or a less than most ultra cutting edge, you may be quietly admitting "we can't manufacture and assemble and test this reliably enough at a reasonable cost, even if toyota could"
[00:32:29] <quanticle> Or heck, the Subaru that I own had its final assembly in Indiana -- it doesn't seem to be any better or worse than a Subaru from Japan.
[00:33:09] <gwern> as an american, can you even buy the chinese teslas? I'd assume they are exclusively for the chinese market
[00:33:25] <ggreer> tesla keeps revising their assembly methods. I think their end goal is to die cast the front and rear thirds of the chassis, then use the battery pack as the middle of the chassis
[00:33:39] <quanticle> I think that's the problem. 
[00:33:45] <ggreer> chinese teslas are for the china & EU market. I don't know if any make it to the US
[00:34:04] <quanticle> Traditional auto manufacturers finalize a design and then manufacture it without modification for years.
[00:34:14] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[00:34:17] <quanticle> Whereas Tesla... constantly tweaks the design
[00:34:21] <ggreer> also the chinese teslas use LFP batteries which weigh more but have better longevity and safety
[00:34:26] <Khoth> like, the ak47 was designed by someone who knew how to make guns
[00:35:04] <ggreer> Khoth: so was the AR-15, but both designers knew their constraints (manufacturing, maintenance, training, etc)
[00:35:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: We were discussing this yesterday
[00:35:45] <ggreer> had stoner had the manufacturing capabilities and poorly trained armies of soviet russia, he would have made something similar to the AK
[00:35:56] <quanticle> Yeah, the reason the AR-15/M-16 has a bad reputation isn't because it's a bad design, it's because the US Army *deliberately* sabotaged it
[00:36:14] <quanticle> Because it was from an outside firm, rather than Springfield Armory
[00:38:13] <Khoth> I mean like, Kaloshnikov was able to design a gun that didn't need high tolerances, but he wouldn't have succeeded if like your [XX:58] he didn't have any idea what tolerances were actually needed
[00:38:14] <ggreer> quanticle: oh btw I saw a clip from an interview with rittenhouse where said he used the forward assist to fix a malfunction and shoot grosskreutz. that's gonna be used in so many pointless arguments
[00:38:33] <quanticle> The US Army forced Armalite to license the gun to Colt (ostensibly because Armalite was a new company and the US Army didn't think they were established enough to meet the volume demands) and Colt made modifications (like the forward assist) that went against Stoner's intent.
[00:38:34] <ggreer> I'm still in the "no forward assist" camp

[01:45:35] <spxtr> You made the right choice, CS grad school is a dumpster fire.
[01:46:19] <spxtr> That said, many people in really slick research jobs at places like deepmind or whatever got those jobs because of a relevant phd
[01:46:32] <quanticle> I regard even the software engineering courses that were forced upon me as an undergraduate to be a waste of time. It was because of those courses that I didn't have time to take a class on compilers, something that I'm still mad about.
[01:46:56] <quanticle> Because the other day, I was trying to write a parser, and I was like, "Man, it sure would be nice if I had some education on this"
[01:47:13] <quanticle> "Instead of trying to figure everything out from reference materials and first principles"
[01:47:16] <spxtr> I didn't have time for a distributed systems class and reeeaaallly would've appreciated it when working on Kubernetes

[01:52:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> No useless theory there
[01:52:25] <quanticle> Ah, well, that explains it. My software engineering courses were basically an intro to formal verficiation.
[01:52:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol
[01:52:59] <quanticle> Which is fine if you're working on software for which formal verficiation is required, but absolutely irrelevant for the vast majority of software that doesn't even exist in the same building as a formal verifier.
[01:53:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, we never learned any kind of thing like that
[01:53:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Pretty much all my CS courses were very practical

[01:54:42] <spxtr> It was suprisingly good for learning things like edge detection, but it was already clear at the time that the field was moving on.
[01:55:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Meanwhile, I tried watching Dexter: New Blood
[01:55:27] <quanticle> Yeah, why bother making edge detection yourself when you have a neural net doing all that (and more) for you?
[01:55:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> And... well, I could keep watching it. It seems like they are pretty much making more of the same, fairly faithfully, following the original formula and all

[02:02:36] <saturn2> true

[02:07:50] <kuudes> saturn2, indeed, that is my take as well. the alternative proposed seems rather odd
[02:08:37] <Betawolf> It's still quite tame jerkiness, though. It would be a different movie if he'd, like, drowned the waitress in a toilet.
[02:08:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: nm I get it
[02:10:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: So, this will probably be useless for TTRPGs
[02:11:10] <saturn2> if he doesn't start out as a jerk he no longer has a redemption story, he becomes just a small business owner aimlessly bumbling through life
[02:11:20] <quanticle> Oh? I thought it'd be pretty useful, since you can project whatever map you want
[02:11:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Everything hinges on the content creation process. I see no commentary on that whatsoever, but my guess is that it'll be along the lines of "you need to be a game developer (studio) and you need to write code and basically creating content is a big undertaking"
[02:12:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Whereas for it to be TTRPG-useless the process needs to be more like "upload an image"
[02:12:29] <quanticle> Right
[02:12:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> er, *for it to be TTRPG-useful
[02:13:28] <adiabatic> it's not even jerkness. it's being a man of action who isn't a doe-eyed naïf
[02:14:40] <quanticle> Yeah, that does seem to be the problem with AR games in general, and it's why I see VR having more uptake than AR. AR games are best enjoyed as multiplayer experiences, but unless you can afford to buy four or five AR headsets, you can't have a decent number of people participating. Whereas VR you can enjoy on your own, even if you're the only person in a 100 mile radius with a VR kit.
[02:15:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm not sure that actually *that* problematic...
[02:15:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have one or two friends who wouldn't hesitate long at buying a half-dozen AR headsets so that we could play D&D in VR
[02:16:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> But:
[02:16:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> 1. The content creation problem I described
[02:16:32] <gwern> han was totally an antihero. he shot first
[02:16:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2. How does AR deal with remote gaming? It doesn't, gg
[02:16:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> VR does
[02:16:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> If we're D&Ding over Discord video, those AR headsets are worthless
[02:17:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course VR has that same content creation problem...
[02:17:27] <gwern> why wouldn't an AR headset overlay objects on a table for each player?
[02:17:50] <gwern> you clear off a 2x2 square, everyone gets an assigned edge, bob's your uncle

[02:18:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> "assigned edge"?
[02:18:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> For one thing, then you need not only five (or w/e) headsets but also five of those mats they showed
[02:18:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Everybody's gotta set up their own table thing...
[02:18:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> They can't interact with each other
[02:18:38] <gwern> I'm not sure why you'd even need 'a mat', just a clear space
[02:18:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because that's how the tech works
[02:19:04] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: yeah, I'm sitting at the left edge, you are assigned to sitting across from me. you 'grab' a 'minature' in front of you and move it away from you, which I see as the peice facing me and moving towards me over my table

[02:19:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: D&D's not gonna work that way, lol
[02:20:13] <gwern> you need some dice? same idea. everyone's headset overlays a die somewhere on the table and coordinate. I reach out and grab the die I see and roll, you guys see the die lifted by a hand and rolling
[02:20:34] <gwern> quanticle: spin spin spin
[02:21:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, I see VR as having much more potential here; IMO the big thing would be if people could let go of the idea of VR simulating perceptually realistic reality and instead just giving a more flexibly manipulable virtual space
[02:21:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't want a graphically fancy board that I need to be a design studio to construct, I want to be able to just have a simple grid or something that I can manipulate
[02:22:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't want to virtually roll dice, I want to be able to call up a dice-bot window that gets projected into space visible by all players
[02:22:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> etc.
[02:22:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> I want to be able to upload a .jpeg map and have it be projected on a designated virtual surface
[02:22:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> And so on
[02:23:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Simple, flexible, easily constructable with minimal time investment, easy to manipulate in various ways
[02:23:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just consider this: a simple 2-d map, projected in virtual 3d space on a "tabletop" surface, BUT with the VR software conditionally hiding parts of it - DM sees everything, players see only part
[02:24:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Reach over, move minis on it

[02:25:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's so much potential here for *reducing* the effort DMs and players have to take and *increasing* the scope of what can be *represented*

[05:00:22] <spxtr> rather, they were recently opened up to the public
[05:02:13] <catern> ah, yes, obviously

[05:11:19] <kuudes> well, it is possibly already inside as well, so one would need to start with a strict lockdown first
[05:13:24] <nshepperd> sure maybe
[05:13:36] <nshepperd> either way they are not taking it seriously at all so
[05:14:21] <spxtr> I'm hoping to go visit India in March. Odds that omicron will stop me from being able to do that?
[05:14:22] <nshepperd> i guess we'll die
[05:14:27] <spxtr> (As a tourist)
[05:14:58] <nshepperd> by March it'll have run its course probably
[05:15:35] <nshepperd> so i guess you'll be able to go unless it incites violent revolution
[05:15:42] <gwern> this stuff always takes longer than you think it does, and burecuracy even longer
[05:15:54] <gwern> bureaucrats are slow to impose restrictions but then even slower to remove them
[05:16:06] <nshepperd> that's true
[05:16:34] <gwern> march is closer than it looks, when you take into account the need to decide and plan ahead, among other things
[05:16:41] <spxtr> I'm wary because I got got for $3k right at the start of covid when air india refused to refund tickets that I bought before the pandemic was a thing.
[05:17:12] <gwern> I would definitely not be buying my tickets and booking my hotel for march, let me put it that way
[05:17:52] <saturn2> outlook not so good
[05:20:02] <kuudes> I guess we could all be dead by march, so there would be more seats in planes by then?
[05:20:16] <spxtr> That's a good, positive outlook.
[05:20:58] <kuudes> without vaccines and protections, omicron should run over the world in some 6 weeks I guess
[05:21:14] <kuudes> so if it is still ongoing in march, I guess that is a positive scenario
[05:22:50] <kuudes> it seems it will go tight again, so braking is useful but painful and does not make it go away fast
[05:23:27] <kuudes> with 3 doses I count one gets to 1/33, so that could stop it and still leave it something up to 1/2 effect on vaccine protection
[05:23:45] <kuudes> fourth doses seem likely necessary or useful
[05:24:19] <kuudes> if it nils vaccines, then there is nothing to be done
[05:25:02] <kuudes> when it came to finland, our voluntary 1-2 month full family isolation brough r to 0.5 maybe, and it was 2.4 - 3.0 at start
[05:25:12] <kuudes> so we get maybe 1/5 to 1/6 in a pinch
[05:25:39] <kuudes> but if it is 16 from start, that will get it only to 3 or so
[05:26:04] <kuudes> but vaccines seem like they could still mean something even if plasma would get voided
[05:26:25] <kuudes> natural immunity seems likely to be around nil though
[05:26:49] <kuudes> so the purposeful infection of nonrisk people seems to have been quite moot in any case
[05:27:38] <kuudes> I am still wonder what the hell data there could be for "it is really mild and basically just smiles at you"
[05:27:54] <kuudes> I guess it is to deter panic?
[05:29:11] <catern> the elites are pathological liars, they can't help themselves

[05:30:39] <kuudes> “It’s all speculation at this stage. It may be it’s highly transmissible, but so far the cases we are seeing are extremely mild,” she said. “Maybe two weeks from now I will have a different opinion, but this is what we are seeing. So are we seriously worried? No. We are concerned and we watch what’s happening. But for now we’re saying, ‘OK: there’s a whole hype out there. [We’re] not sure why.’”"

Why suffer on earth hoping to have a wonderful afterlife? Better to have everything you want now and spend eternity in hell. "

[06:20:43] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: that most-hateful-man post is like Chili Floss
[06:20:44] <kuudes> nshepperd, israel bans all noncitizens to enter
[06:20:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> For one thing, Cher's twitter really is the way they describe it: https://twitter.com/cher
[06:20:55] <Robomot> Jester route exception
[06:21:06] <kuudes> what
[06:21:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: I understood that reference
[06:21:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> "IT DOESNT MATTER THERE'S ONLY LOVE&FEAR" lol

[06:22:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, the Cher tweeting keyboard is brilliant
[06:22:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In fact, the keyboard is an old manual typewriter on which both Shift keys have been weighted down with oversize rubies, ensuring that all letters are rendered capital. In addition, a number of other keys have been replaced by emojis. Informants within the Cher camp can report exclusively that the star types on that typewriter herself. “It’s a very physical process,” according to one informant, who wishes to remain
[06:22:41] <Obormot\Arcturus>  anonymous. “She really goes at that keyboard. I’ve seen her knock the rubies off a number of times.”"
[06:26:11] <catern> overall these WWN "funny" articles remind me of the "funny" articles I wrote for the high school newspaper, or like Uncyclopedia. aka, they're not funny
[06:28:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> You just don't appreciate innovative input device design
[06:42:24] <gwern> I wonder if she thinks fear is bad
[06:43:26] <PapuaHardyNet> you used to write for your high school newspaper? impressive
[06:48:32] <ggreer> "ah shit. I'm typing so hard that my rubies are falling off" <-- probably not a problem I will ever have
[06:49:42] <ggreer> I finally bit the bullet and got a smart doorbell. it's some blink thing and it works pretty good and doesn't require you to pay a monthly fee to have amazon record everything (though you can if you want)
[06:50:52] <ggreer> it fails very gracefully. the physical button on the smart doorbell also completes the circuit for the normal analog doorbell circuit so the chime always goes off
[06:51:36] <Betawolf> nice
[06:52:10] <ggreer> oh and it uses the current from the analog doorbell circuit for power, but if that fails it falls back to internal batteries
[06:52:24] <ggreer> so hopefully I won't have to replace the batteries every year
[06:52:51] <ggreer> lastly it lets me have a conversation with whoever is at the door, though it's a little laggy
[06:54:14] <ggreer> https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Video-Doorbell/dp/B08SG2MS3V technology has gotten super cheap
[06:54:18] <Robomot> Blink Video Doorbell (Two-way audio, HD video, motion and chime app alerts and Alexa enabled — wired or wire-free)
[06:54:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> A sensible implementation of a "smart" device?
[06:54:49] * Obormot\Arcturus calls for the fainting couch
[06:54:58] <ggreer> it's... OK. the signup process is fucking painful
[06:55:16] <ggreer> you have to create a blink account and give them your phone number before you can active the damn doorbell
[06:55:20] <ggreer> *activate
[06:55:30] <ggreer> then once you do that, you link it to your amazon account
[06:55:41] <ggreer> why the fuck don't they just let you sign in with your amazon account? I don't know
[06:56:08] <catern> heh https://www.theonion.com/we-ask-dr-fauci-about-what-hes-planning-for-the-next-p-1847931931

I bought some for friends. It’s fun. I show them off at parties. I put them on my business card. It makes me laugh, you know? I put them up on my walls. I smile when I see them.)
[06:56:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh it's still account-based
[06:56:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Never mind
[06:56:37] * Obormot\Arcturus sends the fainting couch back
[06:57:14] <ggreer> I do think I'll get an indoor camera and point it at my guns. if somebody steals that stuff I want to have lots of evidence that I can give to the police. (I would have a gun safe but those are backordered 6 months)
[06:59:08] <ggreer> Obormot\Arcturus: it's account based but you can configure the cameras to never send anything offsite. an acquaintance of mine uses blink cameras at his work because of this. that constraint is also what convinced him to go with blink for home security
[06:59:14] <saturn2> i would assume they want your phone number for marketing
[07:00:44] <ggreer> they claim they never use your phone number for anything besides account verification stuff. they love SMS confirmation codes. want to change your email address? sms confirmation. want to change your password? sms confirmation. want to give someone else access to the system? sms confirmation

[07:10:44] <Robomot> Some states dropping 'dehumanizing' terms for immigrants | AP News (AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Luz Rivas remembers seeing the word on her mother’s residency card as a child: “alien.” In the stark terms of the government, it signaled her mother was not yet a citizen of the U.S.)
[07:15:45] <feepbot> <gwern> https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08658 'nocaps' for 'novel captions' has to be one of the worst dataset names I've ever seen
[07:15:46] <Robomot> [1812.08658] nocaps: novel object captioning at scale (Image captioning models have achieved impressive results on datasets)
[07:16:03] <gwern> strictly speaking, it's a humanizing term. otherwise you wouldn't need 'space' as the prefix for 'aliens'
[07:19:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Heeey, NSRegularExpression supports negative lookbehind now
[07:19:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's the full set of lookaround operators
[07:20:56] <PapuaHardyNet> "alien" is dehumanizing? lol
[07:22:19] <spxtr> > “alien.” In the stark terms of the government, it signaled her mother was not yet a citizen of the U.S.
[07:22:26] <spxtr> correct, that is exactly what that word means
[07:23:27] <gwern> yeah, but now it sounds like the US government is calling your mom a facehugger and since we now believe in linguistic determinism, it hurts her!
[07:24:14] <PapuaHardyNet> linguistic determinism - a nice term to describe exactly what is going on
[07:26:06] <gwern> it's funny, I read all this stuff in college from the 1960s/70s and '90s, and I never imagined all this silly stuff would pop right back up almost completely unaltered
[07:27:00] <gwern> have we seen people seriously propose renaming 'history' to 'herstory' yet? no, history rhymes, it doesn't repeat, and the silly naming demands will focus on different words. but the underlying superstitious belief in the power of incantantions and curses is the same

[07:32:17] <PapuaHardyNet> okay check this out: there are three classes of methods to control text generation
[07:32:49] <PapuaHardyNet> modify the input (prompt design including prompt tuning and prefix tuning), modify the model (fine tuning and its variants)
[07:33:08] <PapuaHardyNet> and modifying the output (sampling methods)
[07:35:13] <dv^_^> I thought the Greeks invented it
[07:36:37] <PapuaHardyNet> whites, always brazenly reappropriating innovations by minorities
[07:36:52] *** Joins: samir (~azureuser@user/samir)
[07:39:53] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: I am mildly curious what other classes are even logically possible which don't fall into 'change the input' / 'change the model' / 'change the output'
[07:41:34] <gwern> (I suppose you could try to modify the model's activations etc at runtime directly somehow and argue that doesn't fall into 'change the model' since that usually only changes the 'slow' weights as oppoed to the runtime fast weights? feels strained but also not an approach I've seen yet)

[07:49:18] * gwern has seen that before but still good
[07:52:52] <PapuaHardyNet> gwern: yeah, I doubt there's any method that won't fall into one of the three classes
[07:53:23] <PapuaHardyNet> changing the architecture imo counts as changing the model
[07:54:07] <gwern> 'change the world to make the outputs correct'
[07:54:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ah yes, the _Burdened With Evil_ approach
[07:55:07] <adiabatic> dv^_^: https://www.toohotforbeer.com/Iñigo-Montoya-s-Guide-to-Personal-Networking-Success.jpeg
[07:55:08] <Robomot> image/jpeg (500x500; 68 KB)
[07:56:04] <adiabatic> eh, copy and paste works well enough
[07:57:21] <gwern> you have to admit, changing the world to make the outputs more correct does *not* involve changing the inputs, model, *or* outputs
[07:59:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is there any existing literature on doing regexp replacement on styled/attributed text? Anyone know?
[08:00:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: ^ ?
[08:01:30] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: this sounds very similar to "regex on HTML"
[08:04:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> nnno, not quite
[08:04:08] <nshepperd2> dv^_^: they're actually doing this to prevent confusion when the us government grants the Roswell survivors compassionate citizenship
[08:04:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> The problem here has nothing to do with parsing any markup
[08:04:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm working with NSAttributedString, which uses out of band storage of attributes, as you know
[08:05:01] <gwern> oh, so you want structural/AST regexps because you have a preparsed AST?
[08:05:05] <nshepperd2> bc they failed to repair the spacecraft and hence cannot be deported back to betelgeuse
[08:05:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> So the regexp per se operates on the unstyled string; there is in fact nothing unusual about the *matching* process
[08:05:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: nnno, I don't think that's quite right either
[08:10:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: There's no syntax tree or anything. The way that NSAttributedString works is that you have a string, and then you have some (opaque, details irrelevant) data structure which stores "runs of attributes", each of which consists of a range in the string and a key-value dictionary with various attribute values (font, color, whatever) and which you can enumerate over, query for attributes within some range, etc.
[08:11:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: In other words, a string, plus "the following range of the string has these attributes, while this other range of the string has *these* attributes, etc."
[08:11:40] <quanticle> So what's the problem?
[08:11:55] <quanticle> Seems like you can regex replace the string without worrying about having to skip over markup
[08:12:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Yes, you would think, but consider this:
[08:13:38] <quanticle> gwern: re: the "science and math are white colonialism" my response is, "Excuse me? You think you Persian upstarts invented math? We invented zero!"
[08:13:53] <gwern> indians are a zero in math, got it
[08:13:58] <quanticle> lol
[08:14:13] <quanticle> Whatever makes you feel better about the composition of the Math Olympiad team
[08:14:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Say you want to run s/^\s*(.+?)\s*$/ on " foo bar baz ". What you want to get, of course, is "foo bar baz", but the straightforward replacement method gets you "foo bar baz".

[08:14:39] <Robomot> Australian government to introduce social media legislation to unmask online trolls ()
[08:14:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Because replaced characters inherit the attributes of the first character of the replaced range)
[08:14:55] <quanticle> Ohhhh
[08:15:34] <quanticle> dv^_^: Did the Australian government ask Google how well its real name policy worked out?
[08:16:27] <dv^_^> Must be going pretty well given that I can't watch "sensitive" youtube content like court videos without giving google my passport or credit card
[08:17:11] <nshepperd2> dv^_^: aka the 'no being gay online' act
[08:17:32] <dv^_^> Granted, I've never tried to comply so maybe there's a next step where you have to send google a dna sample
[08:17:50] <quanticle> Well of course, they have to verify that you're you
[08:18:00] <nshepperd2> 'Prime Minister Scott Morrison said an important part of free speech in Australia was being held responsible for what a person says.' so that's how it works
[08:18:36] <nshepperd2> right out of the ccp's book
[08:19:05] * quanticle was listening to a Lawfare podcast with an Australian legal scholar and she said, at one point, "Yeah, it's fun to watch my American colleagues heads explode when I tell them there is no actual right to free speech in Australia."
[08:19:34] <quanticle> She went on to explain that free speech in Australia is the extension of common law guidelines, and isn't actually legally codified anywhere
[08:20:03] <dv^_^> There's no right to free speech in america either, as some people who tried to sing happy birthday found out
[08:20:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Where's that "circle of accountability" scene from "Chernobyl"
[08:20:28] <quanticle> dv^_^: Happy Birthday is out of copyright
[08:20:32] <quanticle> You can sing it now!
[08:20:42] <quanticle> It's free!
[08:20:55] <adiabatic> disney stopped pushing for copyright extensions
[08:21:03] <adiabatic> they were scheduled to do so, like, last year or something
[08:21:15] <adiabatic> but now they have the giant fountain of money known as capeshit
[08:21:40] <adiabatic> so they don't need to have copyright to keep steamboat willie out of the public's hands
[08:22:01] <quanticle> I won't be around to see it, but I predict a huge copyright fight in like 2120 or so, when the copyright on like Captain America expires
[08:22:18] <gwern> happy birthday was out of copyright forever, they were just lying about it penalty-free :(
[08:22:52] <nshepperd2> Obormot\Arcturus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8oDEwvec1c oh yeah hehehe

[08:26:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> One of the better ones in the series
[08:27:06] <quanticle> That series was pretty good, as a whole, I think
[08:27:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> It was ok

[08:29:04] <quanticle> Bulletproof windows, armor plated, run-flat tires, gun ports, roof hatch for you to mount a .50cal. You could probably even take it into downtown San Francisco
[08:30:21] <gwern> they're making fun of it, but have they seen the $70k teslas that get your groceries wet?

[08:37:11] <nshepperd2> quanticle: is this the techwear of infantry mobility vehicles
[08:38:01] <gwern> nah, you can't buy it in a mall\
[08:40:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm. This really is not decidable deterministically, is it
[08:41:36] <gwern> I have to say, this sounds similar to https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/ where deciding how to handle formatting across edits was... not trivial
[08:41:37] <Robomot> Peritext: A CRDT for Rich-Text Collaboration (Collaboration on rich text is hard to model with plain-text approaches. We review the challenges and how to construct a CRDT for rich text.)
[08:42:06] <gwern> (I think they also maintain the rich metadata as a separate list of spans too, even)
[08:42:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, there are several editing models in use in the wild that use a similar approach
[08:42:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> iirc draft.js does something like that, for instance
[08:42:48] <quanticle> nshepperd2: I don't properly understand why they're selling it here; seems like the target market for it is Sout Africa
[08:42:53] <quanticle> *South
[08:43:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's a very powerful approach in general
[08:43:38] <PapuaHardyNet> that SUV sounds like one hell of a mobile home
[08:45:37] <nshepperd2> "homeless google employee lives in an armoured personnel carrier" does sound very SF
[08:46:32] <quanticle> Homeless programmers living in surplus APCs just reinforces my image of SF has cyberpunk IRL

[08:46:57] <quanticle> Yeah
[08:47:58] <quanticle> While getting massages from his VR anime waifu
[08:51:54] <PapuaHardyNet> how do you get a massage from a VR anime waifu
[08:52:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmmm. Perhaps a hack will do for now
[08:52:40] *** Joins: Khoth (~Khoth@88.97.50.251)
[08:55:13] <quanticle> PapuaHardyNet: In the book, he has one of the massaging chairs
[08:55:26] <quanticle> That gives him a massage IRL when his waifu gives him a massage in VR
[08:55:59] * gwern doesn't remember that. quanticle clearly remembers the details here better than gwern does
[08:56:58] <quanticle> Well, I just remembered because in the book, Hiro meets him in VR before he meets him IRL. He sees the waifu giving him a massage in VR and thinks its a bit silly, but after seeing how it works he's like, "Oh, I get it now"
[08:58:15] <quanticle> ggreer: Hopefully you bought dimmable LEDs otherwise you're going to have a fun strobe light
[08:58:25] <ggreer> it's dimmable
[08:59:10] * quanticle bought a non-dimmable LED bulb for his bathroom, not realizing that one of the two switches controlling the light had a dimmer attached
[08:59:48] *** Quits: [itchyjunk] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[08:59:57] <quanticle> I replaced the switch, rather than the bulb, because the fact that I hadn't even realized that the switch was dimmable meant that I'd never actually used the dimming function
[09:06:14] <quanticle> nshepperd: re: the Australian speech law, I think the bigger concern is the fact that the truth is not an absolute defense against libel in Australia, and that Australian politicians have won libel victories against journalists that have posted true, but embarrassing information

[09:12:23] <Robomot> A space elevator is a proposed type of planet-to-space transportation system. The main component would be a cable anchored to the surface and extending into space. The design would permit vehicles to travel along the cable from a planetary surface, such as the Earth's, directly into orbit, without the use of large rockets. 
[09:12:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> There we go.
[09:13:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> A hack, but a reasonable one...
[09:14:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now... time to read the Concurrency Programming Guide
[09:14:02] * Obormot\Arcturus steels himself
[09:18:17] <ggreer> Now I need to find dimmer switches with a sane UI. I like the slider ones with a switch on them. Also they need to glow in the dark
[09:18:33] <quanticle> Lol, I dislike those slider ones so much
[09:19:11] <quanticle> I have one on one of my lights downstairs, and *without fail* I'll end up sliding the slider when I toggle the switch off
[09:19:11] <ggreer> The knob ones give me nostalgia but they’re bulky
[09:19:20] <ggreer> Haha
[09:19:43] <quanticle> I'll probably end up stripping that out of for a regular switch as well
[09:19:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is there a lightswitch version of touch lamps?
[09:19:54] <quanticle> Because I don't really use the dimming function on that one either
[09:19:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> I love touch lamps
[09:20:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> All my table lamps are touch lamps
[09:20:30] <quanticle> Wow
[09:21:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Don't tell me you didn't know about touch lamps
[09:24:40] <quanticle> No, I knew about touch lamps, but I didn't you were so devoted to purity in UI that you had *only* touch lamps

In a move that would be rather shocking today given the obsessive secrecy surrounding films in production, Ballantine's novelization for SW ghostwritten by Allen Dean Foster was published around the same time as the first trailer. The novelization soon broke a number of publishing records and sold out of its first print run by February. As with
[09:41:42] <quanticle> other promotional materials, the book featured stunning McQuarrie production art. Later Ballantine/Del Rey publications would include movie stills and other behind the scenes materials to the public."

[11:11:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nobody cares about "best human"
[11:11:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> And a game with no competition at the high end inevitably degenerates and becomes boring and irrelevant
[11:11:40] <spxtr> Many many people care about the best human.
[11:11:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: Sounds like a nonsense premise
[11:11:53] <spxtr> That's why the world chess championship is so popular and Carlsen is so respected.
[11:12:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: Inertia. Fewer and fewer people care. And Carlsen isn't really all that respected
[11:12:26] <spxtr> Obormot\Arcturus: Do you have statistics to back that claim?

[11:12:49] * Obormot\Arcturus shrug
[11:13:03] <Gurkenglas> Obormot\Arcturus, consider that you invent AGI and take over the world and refrain from building superhuman competitors at everything because that would be sad. Would this prevent the sad?
[11:13:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: Depends on the AGI and the takeover I guess
[11:14:29] <spxtr> I for one look forward to Carlsen vs Firouzja in 202X.
[11:14:33] <Gurkenglas> the agi is "benevolent genie", its powers are "turns out i have root access", the takeover is "i add a script that melts any computing substrate that tries to run an agi"
[11:14:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok
[11:15:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guess that mostly doesn't have any consequences for the value of competitions or w/e
[11:15:36] <rsaarelm> I definitely get the same sense Obormot does that a big deal with chess all the way up to 1997 was the whole "who's got the biggest brain on the planet" deal.
[11:16:11] <rsaarelm> People don't like to talk about it out loud but there was really something of a "well that's that then" when it stopped being humans.
[11:16:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yep
[11:16:49] <rsaarelm> I never personally figured chess as a thing that's fun to play though, so maybe I'm biased.
[11:16:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> The idea of anything like Fischer/Spassky or Kasparov/Karpov happening today is laughable, for instance

[11:22:01] <Gurkenglas> whether dota is dead is subjective, then! alright. so this devalues the game for you but not for the world?
[11:22:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: It's subjectively objective
[11:23:12] <Gurkenglas> what's that mean? you have the opinion that it's objective?
[11:23:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> no
[11:23:16] <spxtr> Obormot\Arcturus: Seems like it was on the way up since 2015 or so, even ignoring queen's gambit
[11:23:38] <spxtr> That doesn't look like a dead game to me at all.
[11:23:45] <rsaarelm> I don't think I actually have any primarily competitive game I like. Never imprinted on any or having fun with one.
[11:24:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: "subjectively objective" is a term that means "it is objectively true that it has certain effects that are themselves subjective (mediated by people's beliefs and so on)"
[11:25:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: You're reading something into fluctuations... the decline since ~2004 is obvious, and after a brief pandemic-induced surge the popularity's back to the trend line
[11:25:52] <spxtr> the big bump in Nov 2020 was the queen's gambit
[11:26:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's even worse
[11:26:38] <spxtr> I think this line is clearly increasing, and it's not some fluctuation effect
[11:26:44] <spxtr> since ~2015
[11:27:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Disagree but w/e, any increase, if there, is very small
[11:27:46] <Gurkenglas> Makes sense. Then I am mostly trying to figure out what precisely these objective parts are that you subjectively privilege - *knowledge* of a superior competitor? because the optimum is already out there in programspace whether or not you look at it
[11:28:05] <spxtr> It's clear that since then it's no longer decreasing. Hard to call it dead if it's not decreasing, but instead it's got occasional bursts of activity.
[11:28:44] <Gurkenglas> You've read about dath ilan, I hope. They have some songs that you're not allowed to play over the radio or make professional recordings of, because you're supposed to sing them with your friends. Does this produce value?
[11:28:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: Meh. I don't believe that such things are real. (Or, equivalently, I demand instantiation before I admit to believing in them in the first place.)
[11:29:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> ("things out in programspace", I mean)
[11:30:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't know what you're getting at with the dath ilan question
[11:30:08] <quanticle> Gurkenglas: Dath Ilan is a fictional place.
[11:30:20] <quanticle> It's not real, and therefore invoking it carries no evidentiary value
[11:30:58] <quanticle> Dath Ilan has songs that you can't sing on the radio and Star Trek has replicators. Both are equally irrelevant.
[11:30:59] <Gurkenglas> It's a hypothetical, and therefore invoking it gathers information about preferences! How else are we supposed to gather information about preferences.
[11:32:03] <quanticle> By asking people about the real world? Like, if you can't meaningfully connect your hypothetical to a real world situation, you're not even *close* to gathering real preferences! You're getting what people want to believe, at best, and troll answers at worst.
[11:32:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: What if you actually can't gather information about preferences
[11:33:08] <Gurkenglas> quanticle, there are things that we might do that shouldn't happen even once
[11:33:44] <quanticle> I mean, you can gather information about preferences, but doing so involves the tricky business of actually watching people or, god forbid, interacting with them in a manner less detached than handing them a survey about a hypothetical situation.
[11:34:21] <quanticle> Gurkenglas: I mean, sure, but you don't need to hand out a survey to understand that the extinction of humanity is a bad thing
[11:34:29] <Gurkenglas> i guess what people say they endorse is not the same thing as whether they'd enjoy a situation...
[11:35:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[11:35:31] <Gurkenglas> Obormot\Arcturus, by preferences you mean "would enjoy", right?
[11:35:40] <quanticle> One of the things I find most irritating about Eliezer is his propensity for creating hypothetical situations and then arguing from those hypotheticals as if they were really existing places.
[11:36:04] <quanticle> He does this with that whole Beistukai or whatever
[11:36:06] <Gurkenglas> i posit that we should do what people endorse, not what they enjoy.
[11:36:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: Uh, depends on the context?
[11:36:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: I don't think *I* used the word "preferences" in this conversation...
[11:36:40] <Gurkenglas> <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: What if you actually can't gather information about preferences
[11:36:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: That was in response to you using the term first
[11:37:08] <Gurkenglas> right and your response sounded confusing so i was trying to taboo "preferences"
[11:37:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, what I mean by preferences is whatever you meant.
[11:37:47] <Gurkenglas> i meant endorsement. we sure can gather information about endorsement.
[11:37:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Can we, though
[11:38:10] * quanticle whispers "social desirability bias"
[11:38:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just in general, if Alice says "doing X is a bad way to Y" and Bob says "how else are we supposed to Y!", it's always possible that the answer is actually "you can't, lol"
[11:38:41] <Gurkenglas> yeah. someone endorses something if and only if they say they endorse it. in order to gather this information you ask them. *I* am having trouble considering the hypothetical where this information can't be gathered...
[11:38:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> And no amount of "but I really want to Y" or "it's very important that we Y" or any such thing will change that even slightly
[11:39:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> In other words, https://www.gwern.net/Causality#the-problem
[11:39:10] <Robomot> Why Correlation Usually ≠ Causation · Gwern.net [] (Correlations are oft interpreted as evidence for causation; this is oft falsified; do causal graphs explain why this is so common, because the number of possible indirect paths greatly exceeds the direct paths necessary for useful manipulation?)
[11:39:15] <Gurkenglas> do you mean, like, "what if you can't talk to people"?
[11:39:21] <quanticle> Gurkenglas: What if the person says they endorse something because they feel like the interviewer expects them to say that they endorse it?
[11:39:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: It's a general point
[11:39:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: The possibility always exists that the data you're looking for is just not available to you and you can't get it.
[11:40:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> And whatever you were planning to do with that data, you can't do it.
[11:40:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> And whatever questions you wanted to answer by using that data, you can't answer them and you just have to deal with not having those answers.
[11:40:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> And so on
[11:40:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> The reasons why this might be so will differ, of course, from case to case

[11:45:23] <saturn2> Gurkenglas: please don't do what people endorse, i don't endorse that
[11:45:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: We try but actually we mostly fail horribly, and ideally we <...> but actually we <something else>
[11:45:54] <quanticle> I imagine the first time Miyazaki retired, Studio Ghibly threw a grand retirement party for him. The second time, they threw quiet dinner at a local restaurant. Now they're probably like, "You're retiring? Okay, see you in a month"
[11:45:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: Read the link, it'll enlighten / depress you
[11:46:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas, saturn2: I only endorse doing what nobody endorses
[11:47:29] * quanticle gasps
[11:47:31] <quanticle> The Gödel gambit!
[11:47:49] <Gurkenglas> saturn2, noted, though I'm quite likely to ignore that as a compromise. Of course, if enough people say that, the entire approach is thrown out. And maybe Obormot was trying to ask "what approach would you replace it with?".
[11:49:15] <saturn2> i mean, doing what people endorse is how you get witch hunts
[11:49:57] <Gurkenglas> in the case of "any motion endorsed by 51% passes", which doesn't sound like the right approach.
[11:52:09] <Gurkenglas> my first try at a better approach is "make it so according to at least 90% of the population, we've managed to get an outcome in the best 10% of outcomes"
[11:53:41] <Gurkenglas> my existing backup plan for "gather people's preferences" is "maximize the relative instantiation coverage of the 'happy' region of storyspace"
[11:53:43] <saturn2> that sounds even more hopelessly unmeasurable
[11:54:45] <Gurkenglas> saturn2, i expect that if one tries one's best at the 90-10 thing one still comes out fine.
[11:56:17] <saturn2> why?
[11:58:51] <Gurkenglas> the cheeky reply that i just thought of is "i am 90% likely to think we came out fine"
[11:59:29] <Gurkenglas> the actual reply is "i don't immediately see how it fails in the same manner as your average approach"
[12:01:07] <Gurkenglas> and of course, that doesn't protect us, and in practice i would think for longer, but going from "any motion by 51% passes" to 90-10 still looks like the right direction, right?
[12:02:07] <Gurkenglas> you don't aggregate utility functions by taking an expectation, we need *some* aggregation mechanism, this looks better, hopefully we can do math to the problem before we have to type something into the computer.
[12:02:57] <saturn2> no one will ever be able to count how many outcomes there are, nevermind sort them in order of preference
[12:03:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: You can't aggregate utility functions at all
[12:04:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: This is exactly what I was talking about: you say "we need *some* aggregation mechanism" but actually none exists
[12:04:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: Every proposed "aggregation mechanism" boils down to "let's just make up meaningless numbers and pretend that we got our answers"
[12:04:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> "But we have to aggregate!" But actually we can't
[12:05:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> "But if we don't aggregate then we can't reach optimal decisions!" Correct
[12:05:33] <Gurkenglas> Obormot\Arcturus, indeed we don't do Distribution (World -> Utility) -> (World -> Utility), but we need some U and some (World -> Utility) -> U and some U -> Action and some D and some D(U) -> U
[12:06:24] <Gurkenglas> And the numbers aren't meaningless because actually math is much more elegant than appears at first glance when you gaze deep enough into the abyss
[12:06:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: Sucks to be us then because there is no (World -> Utility) -> U
[12:06:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> (None that doesn't depend on making up numbers, anyway)
[12:07:06] <Gurkenglas> How do you know?
[12:07:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: It's literally a consequence of the formalism
[12:07:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This of course is irrelevant because humans don't have utility functions in the first place)
[12:07:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> (So this entire approach is extremely moot)
[12:08:23] <Gurkenglas> humans not having (World -> Utility) is part of why we need to embed (World -> Utility) in U, a larger space that is supposed to contain what humans have instead.
[12:08:40] <Gurkenglas> s/contain/also contain/
[12:08:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't really know what the heck you're saying anymore
[12:09:29] <Gurkenglas> here's a picture https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cujpciCqNbawBihhQ/self-integrity-and-the-drowning-child?commentId=fwwpQDznGrjXgGi3p

[12:09:30] <Robomot> Self-Integrity and the Drowning Child - LessWrong (Comment by Gurkenglas - We should generalize the model of an agent as a utility function. I expect this)
[12:10:04] <Gurkenglas> the curvy arrow means embedding
[12:10:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> This clarifies absolutely nothing :p
[12:10:55] <Gurkenglas> the / means "utility functions can be modified by constant factors and addendae without effect"
[12:11:14] <Gurkenglas> where do you expect numbers to have to be made up
[12:11:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> "We should generalize the model of an agent as a utility function." ... but no actually we shouldn't, because, again, humans don't have utility functions
[12:11:33] <Gurkenglas> you misread that sentence:
[12:11:52] <Gurkenglas> it means "utility functions are a poor model of agents; we need to use a more general model"
[12:12:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ah
[12:12:19] <Gurkenglas> (editing)
[12:12:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then all that stuff about utility you've been saying is irrelevant though
[12:13:28] <Gurkenglas> utility functions model *some* agents. Expected utility maximizers are reasonably enough agents, and whatever model we should move to should be able to model them too.

[12:18:52] <Gurkenglas> (The real genie instruction for those with an acausal decision theory is "do what i would say after more time to think.". The more of the math we can get done today, the easier the acausal cooperation later.)
[12:24:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't trust my future self, only my present self
[12:25:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> My future self has to prove his trustworthiness to me
[12:25:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> And the only way he can do that is by me becoming him
[12:25:19] <Gurkenglas> then tell it to do what your present self would say after more time to think xP
[12:25:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's just my future self in disguise
[12:26:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> I see through such tricks!
[12:27:24] <Gurkenglas> sounds like your simulated self would work very quickly in order to not become your untrusted future self.
[12:28:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> I certainly don't trust any simulated selves either
[12:29:45] <quanticle> My simulated self would stab me in the back
[12:29:52] <quanticle> I'm 100% certain of this
[12:29:59] <Gurkenglas> then you'd have to more directly use such strategies as having it come up with the math research that says whether preference aggregation is possible.
[12:30:16] <PapuaHardyNet> shawwwn: all right, I now have jax version of gMLP and aMLP written. next up is building a training loop, and then finding a dataset to train on
[12:31:53] <Gurkenglas> Obormot\Arcturus, would you cooperate if placed in a prisoner's dilemma with someone's model of yourself?
[12:32:10] <PapuaHardyNet> I mean, if you cannot trust yourself, who can you trust
[12:32:53] <Gurkenglas> i like to think that continuous personal identity is in the first place just an adaptation for cooperating with yourself.
[12:38:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: Someone's model of me? Sounds nefarious. What are they using it for? Better defect extra hard and then KILL THEM just in case
[12:38:36] <Gurkenglas> they're using it to find out whether you'd cooperate with a model of yourself.
[12:38:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why would they need such information
[12:38:57] <Gurkenglas> for the same reason i'm asking your right now
[12:39:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why do you need it
[12:39:47] <Gurkenglas> i am confused at your distrust of your future self and am feeling out the edges to gather information about what to do with an AGI.
[12:40:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Don't make one
[12:40:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you find one, destroy it immediately
[12:40:35] <Gurkenglas> i don't expect to be able to destroy all of them except by using one
[12:40:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, that's what they all say
[12:41:11] <Gurkenglas> not all of them, some of them are just silly. if *all* of them said that i'd agree we are the silly ones.
[12:41:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> (The message here, if it isn't clear yet, is that all such inquiries and all such hypotheticals are overwhelmingly likely to be tricks of some sort, and should be undermined and subverted in every way and at every turn)
[12:41:58] <Gurkenglas> tricks to what end
[12:42:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Who knows
[12:42:13] <Gurkenglas> how do you think you know this, then
[12:42:18] <Khoth> What if someone made an AGI which stabs people who would cooperate in a prisoner's dilemma with a copy of themselves?
[12:42:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Experience and intuition
[12:42:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or to put it another way, induction
[12:42:47] <Gurkenglas> Khoth, that would be bad, but fortunately doesn't seem incentivized by the acausal landscape.
[12:43:20] <Gurkenglas> Obormot\Arcturus, you're generalizing to out-of-distribution. simulations are quite useful to establish acausal cooperation.
[12:44:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: No, *hypothetical* simulations are *hypothesized by you* to *hypothetically* be quite useful to establish *hypothetical* acausal cooperation
[12:44:40] <Khoth> What if the AGI was made by people who got on and did things instead of writing extremely long lesswrong posts and therefore isn't based on acausal cooperation?
[12:47:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: Note that this very conversation is a perfect example of the point I was making before about preference elicitation and surveys
[12:47:21] <Gurkenglas> Obormot\Arcturus, if you do the same things in hypothetical simulations as in real simulations, you only choose one action to take in both, and should therefore consider concentrating on the overwhelmingly more important case
[12:48:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: But I don't do anything in hypothetical simulations because they aren't real, and I don't do anything in real simulations because they don't exist
[12:48:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Which, admittedly, IS the same thing, so maybe you have a point there)
[12:50:33] <Gurkenglas> Khoth, if that AGI's decision theory is (carefully?) constructed to not do acausal trade then in fact it won't gain its effects, which would be moderately but not infinitely bad
[12:52:44] <Gurkenglas> This would have marginal but not global effects on the acausal landscape, so I'm not sure about the point of that hypothetical?
[12:53:06] <Khoth> The point was that it might stab you for cooperating with a simulation of yourself
[12:53:39] <Gurkenglas> Oh, it was an extension of the previous hypothetical. Then it would still be bad, and fortunately doesn't seem incentivized by the causal landscape either

[13:33:49] <quanticle> Well, I don't know about that. I live out here in the blasted Midwest where the only way to buy snack cakes is in boxes of 5 double-cakes
[13:34:13] <quanticle> So your minimum purchase size is 10, and your minimum consumption size is effectively 2
[13:34:32] <quanticle> Because you're not going to leave that other cake out to get dry and stale
[13:37:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well
[13:38:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> The Christmas tree ones come 5 to a box, 1 per bag
[13:38:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because they're bigger

[13:43:37] <quanticle> Sure, Christmas Trees come 5 to a box, but Christmast Trees are mediocre, so I don't really worry about them

[13:45:13] <quanticle> gwern: https://twitter.com/carolynryan/status/1463225412406939653 Would be interesting to note when Robert Caro writes, because he's both extremely prolific and a nonfiction writer.

[13:50:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> That is objectively incorrect >:|

[13:50:26] <quanticle> Well, okay, I'll put *chocolate* Christmas trees above zebra cakes
[13:50:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[13:50:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wait, there are other ones?
[13:50:49] <quanticle> There are Christmas Trees that are like zebra cakes except less
[13:50:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh huh yeah
[13:50:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well Zebra Cakes are kinda lame anyway
[13:51:05] <capisce^> aiming to write more and better before having anything to write about might be putting the cart before the horse
[13:51:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> The chocolate form of the cake is superior
[13:51:56] <quanticle> capisce^: Well, the problem isn't the writing, it's the fact that you're writing in a journal, and thus the primary topic is very boring.
[13:52:20] <quanticle> I would imagine that taking Caro's approach and writing about something (or rather, someone) else might be more fruitful
[13:52:26] <capisce^> the idea of writing in a journal would be to not have to censor myself

[14:05:06] <quanticle> saturn2: Yeah, that's mentioned in the thread, and the replies point out that COBOL maintenance is often outsourced at relatively reasonable rates.
[14:05:35] <quanticle> That whole idea of people earning GAFAM salaries by doing COBOL was and is kind of a myth

[14:06:38] <saturn2> i didn't think they were earning high salaries
[14:07:08] <saturn2> but i thought they had fairly good job security
[14:07:47] <quanticle> Yeah, I'm not sure that the job security is that great, to be honest. I know a few people around here who were ex-COBOL (usually ex-Unisys)
[14:08:03] <quanticle> And they had job security right up until their system was retired, and then they didn't
[14:08:41] <quanticle> And of course, if you have naught but 15 years of COBOL on your resume, and all of a sudden you're competing against webdevs who know React, you're going to have a bad time
[14:09:14] <saturn2> they still retire cobol systems?
[14:09:14] *** Joins: ua_ (~ua@public-gprs219161.centertel.pl)
[14:10:18] <quanticle> Yeah. Also there are layoffs when the business decides, "You know what, we're going to treat this COBOL system as a black box, and write a Java wrapper around it"
[14:10:33] <quanticle> And eventually the Java wrapper subsumes and replaces the COBOL
[14:10:47] <PapuaHardyNet> sounds super dangerous
[14:11:11] <quanticle> Less dangerous than paying a six figure check to IBM 
[14:11:31] <quanticle> Every year
[14:11:45] <saturn2> if they haven't retired it for the last 40 or 50 years how could it not be lindy yet
[14:12:03] <saturn2> that makes NO sense
[14:13:37] <quanticle> The Lindy effect isn't a guarantee. 
[14:13:56] <quanticle> If it were true, we'd all be immortal
[14:14:37] <quanticle> But if you see a person which has lived for 85 years, your reaction should not be, "Gosh, they've lived for 85 years, I'm sure they'll still be here 85 years from now."
[14:15:23] <synthmeat> lindy is about non-perishables
[14:15:49] <quanticle> The distinction between "perishable" and "non-perishable" isn't obvious in many cases.
[14:16:38] <saturn2> well, you can't prove we're not all immortal
[14:18:43] <Gurkenglas> that's very easy to prove.
[14:18:53] <Gurkenglas> the window's right there.
[14:19:27] <quanticle> Do I need to? The question isn't whether there exists at least one COBOL system which will still be around 50 years hence. The question is whether working on COBOL systems provides good job security. I don't think that it does, because I think that the number of COBOL systems in the wild will continue to decrease as time passes. Now, you might argue that the rate at which the number of COBOL
[14:19:28] <quanticle> systems decrease is less than the rate at which new COBOL programmers are minted, which might be true. But I'm not sure that it is.
[14:19:45] <quanticle> I see Coursera courses on COBOL programming, so there is at least enough demand there
[14:21:38] <quanticle> Anyway, on a different, but somewhat related note... why are architects idiots?

[20:28:27] <feep> I genuinely do not know if the designers of the kinesis advantage 2 were aware that shift-ctrl-end is a shortcut that exists
[20:28:39] <catern> hmm, if in a science fiction novel, a civilization had decided to ban the creation of sub-human slaves with diminished intellects, and who are bound to serve their creators in some way or another, I would think that's totally fine
[20:28:53] <catern> but it's more objectionable if they ban having children
[20:29:00] <feep> cause the key contortion necessary to reach that rivals anything on a standard keyboard
[20:29:12] <catern> for some reason
[20:29:34] <feep> you have to crook your index finger over onto the thumb cluster 
[20:29:46] <feep> but still keep a finger on shift
[20:30:54] <feep> it's borderline impossible, and this is doubly infuriating cause this keyboard clearly has space for ctrl/alt, it just elected not to use it
[20:32:29] <feep> also I think I disagree with the decision to align keys horizontally because it makes certain quick inputs you can do on standard 105 impossible, for example typing cd .. with two fingers rolling over cd
[20:33:10] <feep> I think this keyboard is ideologically committed to a certain input scheme that I think is wrong outright
[20:34:18] <feep> to be clear this is not about the thumb clusters, the thumb clusters are great, alt and ctrl aside
[20:34:20] <feep> but
[20:34:24] <feep> even there
[20:34:28] <feep> ag
[20:35:11] <feep> agh stop hitting return! - oh yeah btw how are you supposed to hit p? like, with which finger?

[20:37:09] <rsaarelm> Oh yeah the tricky return key. I remember that.
[20:37:21] <gwern> catern: what if the slaves can earn manumission, like in many historical slave societies?
[20:37:59] <feep> also I have to borderline curl it to hit {} and [], idk if the designers understand that these are common keys for me
[20:38:15] <feep> same as alt and ctrl

[20:42:31] <feep> sidenote imagine if alt was left of ctrl instead of right, life could be so good aaa 
[20:43:48] <feep> like... we're gonna give the thumb prominence! we're gonna put lots of modifiers under your thumb! we're gonna move a vital modifier key just out of reach of your thumb!
[20:43:55] <feep> who does that!
[20:45:19] <feep> how to say you don't use window managers without saying you don't use window managers lol. I bet the like, i3 switching keys are easily reachable. bastards.
[20:46:33] <gwern> why are you whining instead of remapping?
[20:46:36] <feep> like, just give me backspace, delete, home, end, ctrl, alt in a half circle. with maybe 1cm between rows at most.
[20:46:56] <feep> because I shouldn't have to :v
[20:47:08] <feep> bad design is bad design even if you can fix it
[20:47:33] <feep> also then all the labels will be wrong and I still need those to learn
[20:49:10] <feep> also I'm not whining about what is where, I'm whining about the key positions per se, it's the key placement that is already bad, not what they're bound to
[20:49:42] <feep> the alt key would be a bad key even if it was never used. especially if it was never used!
[20:50:16] <kuudes> if it like this, at current vaccination levels 2% of population of finland will get killed by omicron.
[20:51:00] <kuudes> it is about two years mortality in shorter time than a year
[20:51:24] <kuudes> and that is just the deaths presuming we could treat everyone. we could not.
[20:52:32] <feep> I think I'll bind right shift to ctrl
[20:52:49] <feep> that should fix most awkward things
[20:53:08] <feep> then left ctrl to alt?
[20:53:44] <feep> that gives me easy ctrl-c, v, ctrl-end, even alt-tab

[21:00:06] <rsaarelm> Looks like my default pose is fingers on the home row and thumbs resting on space and backspace.

[21:00:54] <rsaarelm> I need to shift my palm a bit for p.
[21:01:12] <feep> well that's bad tho, isn't it
