[02:02:37] <artok> LiENUS: you do docker-compose up --scale SERVICE=NUM and only ones that are changed, will change 
[02:03:05] <LiENUS> thats my plan but i still need to ideally detect the first one to launch
[02:03:23] <LiENUS> it sends reminder emails on a regular basis if all of the scaled services send an email it would send duplicates
[02:03:54] <LiENUS> im gonna have to rework it to have some form of ipc in the future but for now being able to only run the email service on the first instance would be enough
[02:04:34] <artok> it needs to be really be done in the container level
[02:06:04] <artok> like registering the service when it's starting up to some key/value storage and if there is no others going on, it will handle itself as "first one"
[02:06:32] <artok> even then race conditions need to be taken care of
[02:09:10] <artok> I think it was galera cluster example that registered themselves into etcd and populated cluster configs according to it, don't remember how (if any) race condition checks were done

[06:43:15] <tianon> flatpak is basically built around this concept (although I do admit to emulating flatpak poorly via Docker myself, since I know Docker's edge cases much better and don't have nearly enough bandwidth to learn a new thing enough to determine whether I trust the tradeoffs it implements)

[16:55:50] <TheDcoder> Hi, hope am not going too off-topic with this question, but how do I integrate Let's Encrypt in my images?
[16:56:48] <wez> TheDcoder: You can mount it in from a volume, and manage the renewal in a seperate docker container (or somewhere else).  
[16:58:01] <TheDcoder> wez, right, but I also want certbot to be able to modify my apache configuration, the problem is the certificate isn't permanent
[16:59:13] <TheDcoder> so what I am asking is I guess, if I could somehow preserve the apache configuration via volumes? they are good for putting external stuff into docker but the opposite isn't possible :-/
[16:59:56] <wez> TheDcoder: why do you want it to modify your apache config? just look in the same place for the cert and mount the cert there
[17:00:40] <TheDcoder> wez: it's nice and convenient, certbot can automatically generate the certificate and update Apache to serve HTTPs
[17:00:46] <TheDcoder> *HTTPS
[17:01:08] <wez> TheDcoder: yeah but you only need to do that once
[17:01:10] <artok> umm.. doesn't apache reload certs if they are changed on ?
[17:01:35] <wez> artok: docker exec container killall -HUP httpd
[17:01:40] <TheDcoder> wez: once every month I think, the certificate is only valid for a month or two I think
[17:01:57] <artok> wez is that even needed? 
[17:02:20] <wez> TheDcoder: yeah so?  MOUNT IT IN! if it changes in the volume or network share it changes inside the docker instance
[17:02:40] <wez> artok: to reload apache config it is.  I don't think it auto watches the cert file.
[17:03:22] <TheDcoder> wez: ah, okay, I think I get your point... I could just volume mount /etc/letsencrypt
[17:03:26] <artok> damn
[17:03:38] <TheDcoder> and let certbot do its thing while building the image
[17:03:50] <wez> TheDcoder: yup, that's one way to do
[17:04:10] <artok> proxy and doing ssl termination is the great thing then
[17:04:26] <artok> needs only proxy reload
[17:04:46] <artok> or have proxy that will handle certs, like caddy
[17:04:46] <wez> That's also a good idea artok 
[17:04:48] <TheDcoder> Does docker provide any way to conditionally build images? I don't want certbot for testing purposes for example
[17:05:24] <wez> TheDcoder: yes, use build args to turn off certbot installation or configuration
[17:06:24] <TheDcoder> wez: I don't ever recall seeing them in the docs, can you point me in the right direction?

[17:29:04] <theh> I want to run an application (`nvim`) inside my container as it starts, but drop into a shell when I quit the app, not stop the container. How would I best go about that? Currently I have `CMD [ "nvim" ]` in my Dockerfile which leads to aforementioned behavior. Should I launch a shell instead? Or add `nvim` to be launched from my shell profile?
[17:29:37] <theh> I'm not sure what a good approach is.
[17:30:15] <wez> TheDcoder: a directive is a generic term for a configuration element I guess you can call it

[20:08:33] <anchovy> hey. is it possible to have docker execute a command to build an image or do I need to prep a tarball to extract into the container in order to build it?
[20:12:08] <programmerq> from the perspective of dockerd, it needs a tarball to kick off the build.
[20:12:58] <programmerq> the 'docker build' command will make that tarball from a directory you specify and pass that up to dockerd for you.
[20:13:53] <programmerq> what's the usecase you have?
[20:14:25] <anchovy> I just wanted to avoid pre-making the tarball and just use the commands I'd use to make it as part of the image build itself.
[20:14:49] <programmerq> right, but why is this an issue/concern? Can you elaborate?
[20:15:18] <anchovy> I guess I just wanted to skip a step. tarball seems pointless to me as I wont be hand-editing it. as such saw no point in it.
[20:17:06] <tabakhase> anchovy maybe show what you mean...
[20:17:18] <tabakhase> smells a bit like a missunderstanding somewhere there...
[20:17:28] <anchovy> could be.
[20:17:30] <anchovy> 1s.
[20:18:59] <tabakhase> ideally a nopaste with dockerfile + copypasted session-log from your terminal or so, just so were all on the same page :P
[20:19:11] <anchovy> basically I need to build my own base image. the root fs will be built with 'debootstrap --arch=arm64 --variant=minbase --exclude=gcc-9-base,e2fsprogs,sysvinit-utils bullseye base' (not finished this bit yet) and I saw no point in tarring that just to untar it. wanted to run debootstrap directly as part of the docker call.
[20:19:35] <anchovy> things aren't that complicated (yet :)). just starting on this little project. :)
[20:24:55] <tabakhase> any "why" on `I need to build my own base image` - like, if  understand you right you DONT want to `FROM debian:bullseye` or what?
[20:25:53] <tabakhase> "baseimage" generally refers to a level higher... - like you may have a company-baseimage from debian, adding some stuff "all your projects make use of" -- but like... starting from scratch is a little wild...
[20:29:26] <anchovy> tabakhase: want to run arm on amd. need qemu in there but can't apt-get it cos I need qemu in order to arun arm apt-get on amd.
[20:30:03] <anchovy> so I figured if I build my own image from the ground up I can get it in there at that time and proceed as normal.
[20:32:28] <tabakhase> well i havent touched arm-images, but that smells kinda wrong... - if anything your host needs emu - and the COPY to shove qemu-arm-static or so into it hould work just fine right after the from´s
[20:38:04] <anchovy> yeah I thought of that. it seemed... a little dirty.

[21:02:00] <anchovy> well wrote a script that builds the tarball that docker uses to build the image that the container runs in and it's all working nicely. :)
