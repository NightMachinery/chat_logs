[21:58:36] *** sickill4 is now known as sickill
[21:58:40] <PipeItToDevNull> I have no clue if that is possible, but botname is static so I think it could be
[21:59:05] <bookworm> it is hacky but you can do it with ::before or ::after pseudo selectors
[21:59:23] <bookworm> at least I think so, never tried it
[21:59:58] <PipeItToDevNull> coo
[22:06:27] <MaxLeiter> bookworm: not sure why deb stuff would change, it really hasnt been touched
[22:06:38] <bookworm> it didn't, it was broken already
[22:06:58] <bookworm> well, the uid changed. But that's simply an effect of whatever user runs the build script
[22:07:10] <bookworm> xpaw had 1000, your CI did 2000
[22:07:23] <bookworm> 1000 is the default user you get for a non system user on most distros
[22:07:31] <bookworm> the next is 1001 etc
