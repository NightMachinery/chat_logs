[00:00:55] <evilgohan2> El Salvador, actually.
[00:01:02] <skye0> ,s/Ecuador/El Salvador
[00:01:02] <unfinity> 04<skye0> evilgohan2 El Salvador and Bitcoin, I think that's the country
[00:01:26] <evilgohan2> https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1393419209233870849
[00:01:30] <evilgohan2> oops
[00:01:32] <evilgohan2> wrong tweet
[00:01:42] <evilgohan2> https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1485031106982428677
[00:01:43] <evilgohan2> that's the one
[00:01:59] <evilgohan2> dude is literally memeing the country's economy.
[00:02:59] <skye0> However, even this cryptocurrency website op-ed seems skeptical: https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/24/why-el-salvador-is-botching-its-bitcoin-experiment/
[00:11:40] <ThePendulum> I feel NFTs are 100% unreservedly bunk but I should probably still watch that video
[00:12:27] <ThePendulum> never hurts backing up your intuition with thought ought arguments
[00:12:37] <joepie91> it's worth keeping in your back pocket as a comprehensive teardown
[00:12:49] <joepie91> even some of the cryptobunk people seem to be swayed by it, to my surprise
[00:13:03] <joepie91> also el salvador is a literal dictatorship
[00:13:21] <ThePendulum> joepie91: what persuades them to watch it in the first place?
[00:13:37] <ThePendulum> I don't even have a horse in this race and my millennial brain is already panicking at the 2 hour runtime

[00:14:01] <joepie91> ThePendulum: I suspect you've never interacted with the cryptobunk community much :p
[00:14:26] <joepie91> especially around Ethereum, it's full of people who will watch 3-hour podcasts that contain 5 tweets worth of actual actionable information and a lot of technobabble posturing
[00:14:47] <ThePendulum> I figured they might, but only if they suspect it's in their favor lol
[00:14:52] <joepie91> and then feel Very Clever
[00:15:05] <joepie91> well... sort of
[00:15:10] <joepie91> the cryptobunk community is weird
[00:15:30] <evilgohan2> [15:42:38] <joepie91> it's worth keeping in your back pocket as a comprehensive teardown
[00:15:37] <joepie91> like, there's still some remaining bits of that early "this is an experiment, it could fail, we need to be open to criticism to make it succeed" culture, in a very performative sense
[00:15:43] <evilgohan2> Keep it for that person who says "do your own research", or "I saw it on youtube" ;)
[00:15:50] <joepie91> in that people care a lot about appearing like they are open to feedback
[00:16:04] <joepie91> but will pretty much dismiss every bit of actual feedback out of hand based on some poorly-supported trope
[00:16:20] <joepie91> I suspect that is what made them watch; the sense of "oh, another thing I can debunk"
[00:17:13] <ThePendulum> "hahaha just wait hahaha"
[00:18:52] <ThePendulum> if my favorite nft resident didn't put me on ignore I could indeed pitch it as something for him to laugh at
[00:20:14] <ThePendulum> jeez reddit struggling again?
[00:20:29] <ThePendulum> hmm nothing on down detector yet
[00:20:42] <joepie91> reddit is forever struggling
[00:20:51] <joepie91> it just sometimes gets around to serving a request
[00:21:22] <evilgohan2> yeah
[00:21:29] <evilgohan2> lots of 500-level errors as of late
[00:22:48] <skye0> i'm gonna download that yt video but i at least have the link stored in my notes
[00:23:32] <skye0> i wonder if ASOS is powered by Reddit because it took several tries for me to check out my purchas

[00:26:40] <skye0> i get that NFT bros are stealing off of marginalized artists but the current state of copyright law only helps to protect the rich, and even if otherwise lots of rich and powerful people get away with abusing stuff like DMCA claims before NFT bros did so en masse

Since his shell coiled in the opposite direction of most snails, his organs couldn't align with others. Two contenders were found, but they mated with each other instead of Jeremy"
[15:39:30] <ThePendulum> typical
[15:39:36] <ThePendulum> apparently Jeremy got laid in the end, and then died

[22:25:35] <Hydragyrum> ,bang
[22:25:36] <unfinity> Hydragyrum you shot a duck in 8.204 seconds! You have killed 19 ducks in #datahoarder.
[22:25:37] <skye0> NSFW in case
[22:25:40] <skye0> ,bef
[22:25:40] <unfinity> You tried befriending a non-existent duck. That's freaking creepy.
[22:25:56] <skye0> Damn it
[22:26:25] <skye0> Honestly Activision, Ubisoft and Blizzard don't deserve to operate any further
[22:27:27] <skye0> "But they create jobs and generate income for thousands of Americans" yeah, fuck that when there's just as many who sleep on the streets too and also have to put up with the same environment of hostility you entertained
