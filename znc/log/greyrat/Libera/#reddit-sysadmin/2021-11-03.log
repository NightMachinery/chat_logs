[10:10:25] <JollyRgrs> is it your ass if they aren't charged?
[10:11:43] <JollyRgrs> "oh no, the warehouse guys can't scan b/c the battery went dead. we'll have to put in bad things for his annual review b/c of this"
[10:13:56] <xe0n> NAH IMMA GANK THE DEPARTMENTS WIFI!! and possibly interrupt productivity and day to day stuff for others who had zero to do with it

[10:18:22] <JollyRgrs> "no worse than someone else" doesn't make it a thing you should do
[10:20:02] <xe0n> one person in a department didn't charge a battery, sooo the IT admin goes and ganks the wifi for everyone...."ey yo if you dont charge your batteries your wifi is gonna be slow" riiiiight
[10:20:18] <xe0n> not like the battery can't be charged for an hour in the morning when the person using it realises its flat

[21:40:06] <vinrock> int0x1C8, there's an issue also with the way toyota redesigned the 4banger block and the bolts might be stripped in the block
[21:40:11] <vinrock> in that case you need a new engine
[21:41:39] <AnonymooseReddtr> oh
[21:41:50] <AnonymooseReddtr> JollyRgrs he was taken aback he didn't believe i was that old
[21:41:56] <AnonymooseReddtr> was "this" a career strategy in 2003 not realy
[21:42:09] <JollyRgrs> lol
[21:43:08] <int0x1C8> I just got this thing paid off last year too
[21:43:44] <AnonymooseReddtr> the cloud didn't really exist in 203
[21:43:46] <AnonymooseReddtr> 2003
[21:43:47] <AnonymooseReddtr> rather
[21:44:22] <int0x1C8> clouds existed in 2003 dumbass
[21:44:32] <spiderman> why do devs always try to sacrifice security for convenience
[21:44:56] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> because sec takes a good amount of time to implement
[21:45:36] <thegodsquirrel> security is usually tech debt that never gets fixed..

[21:46:18] <fritzwastaken> but at least I got something on the books
[21:46:22] <JollyRgrs> int0x1C8: ok, but we weren't able to put servers in clouds... they wouldn't stay, they just kept falling
[21:48:12] <vinrock> int0x1C8, market is terrible right now for used cars.  You can probably sell it for what it would sell for two years ago with a working engine.
[21:48:23] <vinrock> But then you have to buy new or you're gonna get fucked right back.
[21:49:37] <vinrock> new water pump and radiator sounds sus if your car isnt overheating, you can probably flush that.
[21:50:44] <int0x1C8> I don't want to be dealing with this right now, fuck
[21:52:07] <vinrock> if you're feeling adventurous you can inspect it yourself without much trouble, its just a pain inthe ass to do
[21:52:18] <vinrock> but you can pull the head and inspect if the back bolts are stripped in the block
[21:52:23] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> spooderman, sec is always a tradeoff between convenience and inconvenience.
[21:52:25] <vinrock> if not, you can get the head decked and set a new gasket
[21:52:37] <vinrock> cost ya a couple hundo at worst
[21:59:17] <int0x1C8> my car was overheating, thats what started this
