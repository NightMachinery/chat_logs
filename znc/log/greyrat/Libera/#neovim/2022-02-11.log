[04:50:57] <dre> Friithian, if you use it less often, then why remember it? ;D 
[04:51:19] <mjlbach[m]> I'm thinking more like set extmarks for all of the text you want, and then trigger it to yank it into a register
[04:51:32] <Friithian> dre: so I dont have to look it up next time I need it

[04:52:53] <dre> mjlbach[m], i get ya, I'd probably make a "scratch buffer" at that point though? but interesting idea none-the-less
[04:53:36] <dre> are ext-marks the same as normal marks? I still haven't dealt with them yet. 
[04:54:44] <dre> I need to write a fennel version of the vim-marks-number-col thing that I use; because it's got a weird thing that I want to change; I wonder if i could include extmarks in the numbers column?

[11:58:35] <ShougoShougo[m]> Why the central repository is not needed?
[11:59:23] <ShougoShougo[m]> The plugin managrs cannot search plugins in the current architecture 
[11:59:27] <mjlbach[m]> I'm not saying there aren't merits to a neovim-elpa, but I think we can get most of the benefit of the spec (dependency resolution for neovim packages and system packages, neovim version bounds checks) without it
[11:59:38] <mjlbach[m]> They can because of the source field

[12:00:32] <max397[m]> If we have a central repository with plugins (afaict that's what you were talking about)
[12:00:32] <max397[m]> this would also fix the "issue" (imo) that we have for example like 5 autopairs plugin

[12:04:07] <ShougoShougo[m]> The central repository advantage is it can be cached.

[12:05:52] <mjlbach[m]> Anyways, we can discuss a central repository at some point in the future, I personally think the spec should accomodate decentralized/git based source specification

[12:21:14] <ShougoShougo[m]> Yeah the spec file is better than README dependency documentation though
[12:21:38] <mjlbach[m]> Hmm wdym Shougo (Shougo)? The only thing you should have to do is bump the `version` and `source` lower bounds (if applicable)
[12:22:07] <ii14[m]> maybe `version` can be removed, and plugin managers could just check the closest tag
[12:22:22] <mjlbach[m]> The closest tag?

[13:52:50] <Famiu[m]> Question, do y'all use any bufferline plugins? (eg: barbar.nvim, bufferline.nvim, vim-airline's bufferline etc.)
[13:53:00] <Famiu[m]> I'm wondering if the majority of people use one or not
[13:54:53] <Famiu[m]> Because I've been cleaning up my Neovim config and removing unneeded plugins to try to be as close to vanilla Neovim as possible, and thinking about if I should remove my bufferline plugin from my config. I wonder what the workflow without a buffer-line plugin is like
[13:55:26] <max397[m]> I use bufferline.nvim
[13:55:45] <Famiu[m]> I really like the idea of Vim tabs and how they store window layout instead of files but plugins like Telescope, as well as Neovim's `:e` command, use buffers instead of tabs
[13:56:44] *** Joins: arch-angel (~arch-ange@user/arch-angel)

[17:49:57] <clason[m]> And what does that do?
[17:50:07] <clason[m]> (many people don't use Discord.)
[17:50:12] <Friithian> it displays what you're currently editing in you {discord,matrix} status
[17:50:25] <Friithian> ``Friithian is editing main.cpp and it has 200 errors!''
[17:50:31] <clason[m]> why on earth would you want that?
[17:50:47] <Friithian> people like sharing what they're doing
[17:50:48] <clason[m]> never mind, none of my business, I don't even want to know...
[17:50:50] <bfredl> does matrix have a status of the same kind as discord? I mean actually visible in clients people use (element, etc)
[17:51:06] <clason[m]> yes, in labs
[17:51:16] <bfredl> but of course
[17:51:20] <clason[m]> (it's only visible in DMs)
[17:51:34] <Friithian> https://i.imgur.com/cljy3JE.png

[17:59:03] <bloony> what does the lsp opt debounce_text_changes flag do?

[17:59:51] <bfredl> discord threads are nice tho (they way you can break out existing convos, archive after a time limit, etc)
[18:00:05] <Friithian> oh I don't like threads either lol
[18:00:10] <clason[m]> needed to avoid overwhelming slow servers while you type
[18:01:18] <Friithian> I swiches caps and esc on my keyboard because of nvim, now every time I use someone else's computer I hit caps lock when trying to hit escape
[18:02:26] <clason[m]> (meaning, all changes within X ms are bundled into a single notification instead of sending one notification per typed character)
[18:02:43] <bloony> aha
[18:04:01] <clason[m]> you almost always want this with, say, ~150ms (which is the default), but some servers are too slow even for that and need a higher debounce
[18:04:20] <clason[m]> (and you can reduce it further if you have a very fast server and insist that you can perceive <100ms delay)

[21:56:40] <DavidMilestone> I want to start with a very minimal Neovim setup for C/C++ and Python programming.

[22:25:53] <wbthomason[m]> Hmm. Maybe this is just because I don't know TS patterns, but that (the nvim-treesitter module template) seems more focused on plugins that run the whole time a buffer is open (e.g. highlights, indents, etc.) than I need. I'm just trying to figure out how to get some information about the node under the cursor as a function.

[23:42:55] <sunjonSenghanBri> I'm pretty sure it doesn't understand what you mean by `~`
[23:42:57] *** Joins: DavidMilestone (~DavidMile@122.179.209.177)
[23:43:08] <senoraraton> That was my next guess.
[23:43:11] <sunjonSenghanBri> I feel dirty helping you to change its location though
[23:43:15] *** Quits: Ziyan (~ziyan@112.134.173.91) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[23:43:31] <senoraraton> Still blank
[23:43:57] <senoraraton> Well technically its not working, so by trying to change its location I can deduce why, and fix it.  Absolute path changed nothing.
[23:44:05] <senoraraton> again set shadafile? returns ""
[23:44:06] <clason[m]> just `nvim -i test.shada` doesn't work?
[23:44:34] <clason[m]> vim will treat `~` in strings literally and not expand it to your home dir
[23:44:44] <senoraraton> :set shadafile? returns "" if I try and give an explicit file
[23:44:49] <sunjonSenghanBri> `let &shadafile = expand("$HOME/foo/bar/shadafile")
[23:45:05] <sunjonSenghanBri> `
[23:45:06] <senoraraton> I just gave it an absolute path, which should work.
[23:45:29] <clason[m]> then I'm out.
[23:45:53] <senoraraton> Sounds like its time to open a bug report?
[23:46:12] <sunjonSenghanBri> wait
[23:46:16] <sunjonSenghanBri> i have a meme for this
[23:46:24] *** Joins: fgrsnau (~fgrsnau@user/fgrsnau)
[23:46:28] * senoraraton waits patiently for the memes
[23:46:29] <clason[m]> no
[23:46:46] <sunjonSenghanBri> it's not worth it, I would watch tv or something
[23:46:57] <sunjonSenghanBri> but the point is it's highly unlikely to be a bug
[23:47:07] <sunjonSenghanBri> what happens when you try the incantation I mention above?

[23:47:43] <DavidMilestone> Hi, what's a use case of `set smarttab`?
[23:47:49] *** Joins: jacky (~jacky@47.202.64.169)

[23:48:20] <nvim-bot[m]> * [`'smarttab'`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'smarttab') in *options.txt*
[23:48:22] <senoraraton> sunjon that works... why does that work?
[23:48:31] <clason[m]> if that doesn't sound useful to you, I'd ignore it and move on
[23:48:40] <senoraraton> At least it sets the shadafile and set shadafile? returns a path
[23:48:42] <sunjonSenghanBri> I need a faster way to find & link those, the window of "funnyness" is approximately 27.4 seconds
[23:49:07] <clason[m]> sounds like you need a... fuzzy finder for memes
[23:49:13] <sunjonSenghanBri> :]
[23:49:28] *** Quits: mon_aaraj (~MonAaraj@user/mon-aaraj/x-4416475) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[23:49:31] <senoraraton> Why does that work, and nothing else work.  For future reference?
[23:50:17] <sunjonSenghanBri> I'm not 100% sure, you cn see `:h let-&`
[23:50:20] <nvim-bot[m]> No help found for:
[23:50:20] <nvim-bot[m]> * `let-&`
[23:50:25] <dchuri[m]> <DavidMilestone> "It is `sudo apt-get install..." <- This installs nvim v0.4.4 pretty sure, because apt still hasn't updated
[23:50:26] *** Quits: DavidMilestone (~DavidMile@122.179.209.177) (Quit: Client closed)
[23:50:43] <sunjonSenghanBri> but your literal string should have worked, if the path was correct
[23:50:49] <clason[m]> sunjonSenghanBri: string options shouldn't be delimited by `"` in vimscript
[23:50:51] <nvim-bot[m]> No help found for:
[23:50:51] <nvim-bot[m]> * `let-&`
[23:51:08] <sunjonSenghanBri> I still think there's something that you're assuming is correct, that is causing it to fail
[23:51:10] <senoraraton> Its still not actually working though.
[23:51:21] *** Joins: epony (epony@user/epony)
[23:51:28] <senoraraton> Although we have made progress.
[23:51:35] <clason[m]> so `set shafile=<full path>`

[23:51:42] <clason[m]> s/shafile/shadafile/
[23:51:47] <sunjonSenghanBri> it's still not clear what we're progressing to; why move it?
[23:52:08] <senoraraton> Because I want it not in my home directory, because I am anal retentive about my home directory.
[23:52:18] <senoraraton> Or at least I don't want it in a non .file in my home dir.
[23:52:51] <sunjonSenghanBri> then you would be changing the XDG_DATA_HOME location
[23:53:02] <sunjonSenghanBri> not specific configs in each app, that's the whole point
[23:53:07] <clason[m]> why not change `$XDG_DATA_HOME` then and kill multiple birds with one stone?
[23:53:22] <senoraraton> If I ech $XDG_DATA_HOME it returns blank
[23:53:31] <clason[m]> that's a shell option
[23:53:36] <clason[m]> not a Neovim option
[23:53:36] <sunjonSenghanBri> then go setup your XDG_CONFIG
[23:54:08] <senoraraton> I'm saying if I run it in the shell.  
[23:54:12] <clason[m]> which has a default location if empty
[23:54:14] <clason[m]> yes
[23:54:15] <sunjonSenghanBri> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Base_Directory
[23:54:25] <senoraraton> https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html
[23:54:33] <clason[m]> the shells default to `.local/share` if that variable is empty
[23:55:11] <sunjonSenghanBri> the home directory, implies user permissions 
[23:55:26] <sunjonSenghanBri> even more important (and utilised) in XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
[23:55:37] <senoraraton> Well I can configure that, after I figure out why its not loading my files properly.:P
[23:55:40] <clason[m]> >  If $XDG_DATA_HOME is either not set or empty, a default equal to $HOME/.local/share should be used.
[23:55:57] <sunjonSenghanBri> I'd leave them all in $HOME for that reason
[23:56:08] <clason[m]> I'm telling you that doing that is a better use of your time than figuring the other stuff out ;)
[23:57:43] <senoraraton> Sure, but that seems trivial, you just have to read the docs, and export the variables in your bash.rc.  Now that I have a valid directory and file created for shada, it "should" be working, it isn ot
[23:59:00] <clason[m]> I have no idea what you're doing now that two alternative approaches are involved at the same time
[23:59:35] <clason[m]> the suggestion is to leave Nvim alone (not set _any_ shada options) and just point `$XDG_DATA_HOME` to a directory you like
[23:59:49] <clason[m]> (which should _not_ be the same as `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`)
