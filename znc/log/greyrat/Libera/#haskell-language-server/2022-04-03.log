[05:40:36] <Guest78> Hi. Is this a reasonable place to ask basicish questions (I read the instructions and have played for awhile but feel stuck) with haskell-language-server + emacs questions? Basically, I am unsure whether I have a working configuration --- when I load a .hs file into emacs a haskell-language-server (and a wrapper) process start, so that seems good,
[05:40:37] <Guest78> but I am unsure how to *do* anything.
[05:43:55] <drsooch[m]> Most functions of any language server are exposed via the editor keybinds. There is a doc of functionality of HLS which does overview how the plugins are exposed (code actions lenses etc)
[05:45:14] <drsooch[m]> https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html
[05:50:05] <Guest78> Thank you! I have seen that doc, but am unsure how to connect that up to emacs. In emacs, I (think I) would expect `C-h m` to give a list of bindings to commands, and `C-h m` isn't giving me anything like that.
[05:52:22] <Guest78> I'm sort of suspecting my setup is partial or incomplete somehow.
[05:59:31] <Guest78> But I'm not totally sure how to tell.

[16:08:49] <michaelpj> Guest78: yeah, you need to consult the documentation for whatever Emacs package you're using to provide LSP functionality: it's their job to provide keybindings
[16:09:20] <michaelpj> As usual with Emacs, some user assembly is required ;)
[16:09:43] <michaelpj> Also check out the HLS docs, which do say something about how to get started with Emacs

[22:12:27] <santiagoweight> Heya - I have two questions: firstly is there a way to join this Libera channel without losing my messages (perhaps via a Desktop client for MacOS). Secondly, I am wanting to implement an HLS plugin: are there any ideas out there for unimplemented plugins? I was thinking of doing a function extraction plugin (you highlight some expression and a
[22:12:27] <santiagoweight> function is extracted with free variables added to the function arguments.
