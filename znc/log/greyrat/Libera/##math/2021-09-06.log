[02:45:55] <Guest63> When I'm doing induction and in particular writing the inductive hypothesis step, is the proper formulation "assume P(n) is true for some n in N"? The proofs I've seen so far simply "assume P(n)", and it's unclear how n is bound here. I know that what I'm trying to prove in this part is "whenever P(n) is true, P(n++) is also true", so it seems
[02:45:56] <Guest63> logical to me to start from "some n in N", and then since I started from this random, generic n in N, when I show that what naturally follows is P(n++), I've by implication shown that this works (this P(n) => P(n++)) for EVERY n in N (since, again, I started from a generic one). And then combining that and P(0) I get that P(n) holds for all n in N.
[02:45:56] <Guest63> Is my reasoning correct?
[02:52:36] <int-e> Guest63: You're right that n will be a natural number. It's kind of implied by the context though (which almost certainly establishes that you're doing an induction proof)
[02:53:02] <int-e> So it's very common to just omit the fact from the text and get to the real meat of the argument instead.
[02:53:43] <mornfall> (or well, something discrete and ordered, anyway)
[02:54:45] <Guest63> int-e My question is more about whether it's "for some n" or "for any n" or "for every n" or "for a number n" or what, because I don't think the formulations which effectively mean "for all n" can be assumed, because that's what we're trying to prove.
[02:55:09] <int-e> Guest63: it's for an arbitrary but fixed n
[02:55:16] <mornfall> (and sometimes it helps to take (∀k < n. P(k)) → P(n), fwiw)
[02:55:32] *** Joins: kakuhen (~kakuhen@user/kakuhen)
[02:55:36] <cuppajoeman> Yeah, if you want to be explicit, you could say, let k be an natural number and assume that for P(k) holds, now we'll show that  P(k+1) is also true.

[02:56:50] <Guest63> Okay, great. That was what I assumed as well. I think it's confusing to say, essentially, "assume P(n)".
[02:57:07] <int-e> Guest63: You want to show P(n) -> P(n+1) for all n. In order to do that, you fix a particular value for n (but leave it unspecified)... and you want to show the implication P(n) -> P(n+1). To that end, you assume P(n), and then show P(n+1).
[02:58:20] <int-e> But the pattern is part of basically every proof by induction. So there's little value in spelling it out in suchdetail.

[03:01:21] <int-e> To prove P -> Q by contradiction, you assume P and the negation of Q.

[03:07:46] <int-e> Ah, "prove whether ... is true" makes no sense, it's the wrong verb. You can, say, determine whether a statement is proof, which means to either prove it or to disprove it.
[03:08:16] <int-e> ...whether a statement is *true*...

[03:10:18] <int-e> Anyway, what you do when disproving the statement has little connection to the induction proof that would prove it.
[03:10:34] <int-e> So I'm confused by the question.
[03:10:36] <Guest63> I know. I'm asking about what's assumed there precisely.
[03:11:19] <Guest63> Am I assuming the original statement as is, or am I fixing an arbitrary n and then showing that it doesn't work for that n, and therefore it doesn't work for other similar numbers?
[03:13:07] <int-e> Hmm, often you'd just point out a concrete counterexample. But if you proceed by contradiction, you'd assume that P(n) is true for all n, which is the negation of what you want to prove, and then draw conclusions from there. So nothing is yet fixed at this point.
[03:13:57] <Guest63> So you're saying it's okay to assume the proposition itself?
[03:14:21] <int-e> When proving its negation, yes.

[10:22:24] <W> ant, a polynomial can be factored by its roots, but one rot might correspond to more than one factor, so e.g. x^2-2x+1=(x-1)(x-1), because it has just one solution, x=1, but it's double - but that's just one possibility, what is the context?

[10:25:00] <W> yeah, it's basically the same thing, but probably the reverse idea; if the discriminant is positive, there's two real solutions (if it's 0 there's one, as in the equation I used as example)
[10:25:46] <ant> Ah, I get it now, thanks :)

[10:33:10] <W> yeah, and the point about factoring I mentioned further justifying it
[10:33:19] <Gurkenglas> δ_c:c→[[c,d],d] is the usual double-dual embedding. [image of δ_c, d] is isomorphic to [c,d]. [[c,d],d] can be sent through a... free functor F? and then Fδ is the unit of a monad. What do you call this situation?

[14:55:41] <Guest76> And why is the first one bad?
[14:56:10] <gauss> you can't just say x/8 in Z
[14:56:26] <gauss> it's not a programming language
[14:56:55] <Guest76> By "in" I mean "\in", and by "Z" I mean "\mathbb{Z}".

[14:57:36] <Guest76> I'm not sure what the issue is then.
[14:57:49] <qed> Guest76, both statements are valid, but usually people use modular arithmetics in such statements
[14:58:06] <Guest76> Not sure why I'd define an extra operator for that.
[14:58:28] <gauss> no it's not valid
[14:58:41] <gauss> x/8 is rational

[14:59:35] <Guest76> It's just a false statement.
[14:59:44] <gauss> yes it's invalid
[14:59:54] <gauss> \in isn't a function returning a boolean
[15:00:14] <gauss> x/8 \in Z isn't a proposition

[15:07:44] <gauss> as for "why you would introduce a whole new operator", it's because they mean completely different things
[15:07:50] <Guest76> In Tao's Analysis I, he writes S1 intersect S2 := {x in S1 : x in S2}.
[15:08:05] <gauss> that's like saying 5 + 5 = 25, why would you introduce a whole new operator *
[15:08:15] <gauss> Guest76: yes that's valid
[15:08:33] <Guest76> Isn't "x in S2" a non-predicate by your definition?
[15:08:41] <Guest76> And it's used as one there.
[15:09:47] <gauss> hmm
[15:10:00] <gauss> i think it's fine here because you're defining the domain
[15:10:16] <Guest76> if A = {3, 5, 9}, then {x++ : x ∈ A} is the set {4, 6, 10}.
[15:10:21] <Guest76> Another statement from his book.
[15:10:25] <gauss> yes
[15:10:27] <gauss> that's also fine
[15:10:36] <Guest76> What's the difference between x in A and x in N?
[15:10:37] <gauss> you can specify the domain on the right in set builder notation
[15:10:39] <qergle> you can also use a mapping on the left of the restriction
[15:11:07] <gauss> Guest76: are you asking literally?
[15:11:08] <qergle> say, {8x | x ∈ N, 1 ≤ x ≤ 6}
[15:11:20] <Guest76> No, I'm not. He specifies the domain on the left as well in the previous quotation with S1 and S2?

[15:11:43] <gauss> the other is a predicate
[15:11:52] <gauss> you can define the domain on the left or right in set builder notation
[15:12:09] <gauss> so {x in S1 : x in S2} is equivalent to {x : x in S1, x in S2}

[16:53:58] <Z-module> well, in n x n matrices over K, if you computed a matrix product "the other way", using the ith column of the left matrix and the jth row of the right matrix to get the i,j element of the product, it does all work out to something. You end up with the so-called opposite ring of M_n(K).
[16:58:58] <oj> Z-module: I'm just looking for a quick way to remember which way the multiplication goes
[16:59:05] <oj> so I don't have to look it up

[17:03:41] <xaltsc> Hey, does someone know stuff about \ell-adic fields (not p-adic) ? From what I can tell, Q_3(\sqrt{2}) has F_9, but in the general case, if L/Q_p if a finite extension of degree n, I would assume that the residue field is F_{p^n}, and how do different extensions of Q_p with same residue fields compare to one another ? Are they isomorphic as fields ? Are they homeomorphic ? Can the norm on such
[17:03:43] <xaltsc> extensions be expressed as easily as in Q_p ?
[17:04:49] <xaltsc> I said \ell-adic but I really just mean p^r-adic in fact; I'm not concerned with the cases where p≠\ell just yet.

[23:06:52] <qergle> on other words, we can define two functions f:R→R f(x)=x^2 or g:R→R_{≥0} g(x)=x^2
[23:07:04] *** Quits: flynn (~mcbloch@user/flynn) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:07:14] <qergle> those two are different. in f's case, the image and co-codomain don't match in g's case they do.
[23:07:15] *** Joins: flynn (~mcbloch@user/flynn)
[23:08:28] <lok91> Hm, but why is that the case?
[23:08:36] <qergle> why is what?
[23:09:48] *** Joins: kakashiA1 (~kakashi@aftr-62-216-211-83.dynamic.mnet-online.de)
[23:10:15] <lok91> Why don't they match in f's case? And why do they match in g's case?
[23:10:20] <Z-module> signum's values are any of -1, 0, 1
[23:10:33] <lok91> Z-module: Apparently not according to that definition? :P
[23:10:38] <Z-module> but yeah, if 0 isn't in the domain, you don't get a value 0
[23:10:50] <Z-module> that should not be called "signum"
[23:10:52] <qergle> lok91: because they simply don't. the codomain is part of the definition. we decide what that is when defining the function.
[23:13:04] *** Quits: magic_ninja (~sparkie1@ip24-255-219-188.ks.ks.cox.net) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:13:42] <lok91> So the codomain is something we decide, not something we can "find"?
[23:13:46] <qergle> right
[23:13:49] <Z-module> right lok91
[23:13:58] <qergle> it is part of the function's definition. not a byproduct.
[23:14:59] <Z-module> in spite of what many lower-level course exercises will lead you to think

[23:17:02] <lok91> They often ask what the co-domain is... but maybe that's because they want us to look at definitions :P
[23:17:12] <lok91> Where someone decided it.
[23:18:38] *** Quits: aman (~aman@user/aman) (Quit: aman)
[23:22:55] <lok91> So for example, the floor and ceiling functions... would the range/image also be Z there? Like the co-domain?
[23:23:15] <qergle> didn't we just agree the co-domain is decided by us?
[23:23:16] <Z-module> image is Z for both, yes
[23:23:19] <lok91> That would be something like floor(x) : R -> Z?
[23:23:25] <Z-module> (if the domain is R as usual)
[23:23:39] <lok91> Yeah
[23:23:50] <qergle> therefore no lok91
[23:24:42] <lok91> qergle Well, yes, we agreed on that in general... but these are "standard functions"? Isn't the codomain *always* Z for these functions?
[23:24:51] <qergle> didn't we just agree the co-domain is decided by us?
[23:24:55] <lok91> Can we just decide on a different codomain for standard functions?
[23:25:36] <qergle> we just had a 10 minute debate about your text using a *NONSTANDARD* definition for signum
[23:25:46] *** Joins: jmft2_ (~jmft2@213.31.248.255)
[23:26:23] <qergle> so my answer is no. you're wrong.
[23:26:46] <lok91> OK, sorry :P
[23:26:56] <qergle> when defining a function for me, i insist that you provide the co-domain as part of that/
[23:28:45] <lok91> Then I know that :D

[23:34:56] <qergle> lok91: if i seem difficult it's not with that intent, this is the level of rigor needed for these things to make sense to you.
[23:35:13] <qergle> otherwise we can't speak intelligently about why co-domain and image might not match, etc.
