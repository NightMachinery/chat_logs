[02:24:19] <SysGhost> Long story short: Arch and many other "up to date" distributions scrapped pam_env.so due to security issues. Some distributions relying on old obsolete configurations still might use it.
[02:24:33] <thurstylark> it was an upstream change
[02:24:40] <thurstylark> which is why it's in arch now
[02:25:17] <thurstylark> or, at least the default changed to not enable pam environment management
[02:25:23] <ouestbillie> im not asking for arch at work, but centos is literally deprecated arghh

[05:39:04] <mpan> dignissimus: the point is, it should NOT be installed in a directory. It should be a mount point. Strictly speaking you may make an installation in a plain directory, but you will have to chroot into it to use it and you will not be able to run kernel off it without some weird acrobatics.

[06:52:49] <ectospasm> I don't use Firefox, so my answer defaults to,"No."

[06:53:03] <MortimerHoughton> Gotcha

[06:53:38] <ectospasm> I use official Google Chrome for work stuff, and I just started using qutebrowser on this laptop for personal stuff.
[06:53:54] <MortimerHoughton> Ah, I used qutebrowser a bit too.  I really liked it
[06:53:58] <h4rd3n3D> MortimerHoughton:  no issues with FF 95.0.2-1 here
[06:54:24] <ectospasm> If I can get qutebrowser installed on my work-issued MacBook Pro (without having admin privileges), I'll use it there as well.
[06:54:25] <MortimerHoughton> I only stopped because I didn't want to contribute to a monobrowser (engine) web culture

[07:15:30] <ectospasm> That was why I quit using Firefox.  At some point it thought it had crashed, and only gave me the choice between safe mode and refresh.  It hadn't crashed, but I had no other option.

[07:19:44] <ectospasm> And deleting those crashes the browser?

[07:19:54] <MortimerHoughton> It's guaranteed

[10:27:54] <amosbird> Hello! Recently I bought a new screen with 3840x2160 resolution. However I'm used to 1920x1080 resolution, which somehow makes the new screen blury. Is there anyway to make it better?

[10:36:52] <grawity> hmm in theory that should have a non-blurry option but I guess hardware scaling is just like that, even for exact 2x
[10:36:53] *** Joins: tirnanog (~tirnanog@user/tirnanog)
[10:37:35] <grawity> why not configure the GUI to use 3840x2160 but with 2x scaling for widgets and fonts instead? that way you'll get roughly the same size as 1920x1080, but with much smoother lines and everything
[10:38:14] <kib> in chromium i keep getting signed out of google for some reason how do i troubleshoot?
[10:38:19] <kib> i never clear cookies
[10:38:22] <JTL> grawity: ^^
[10:38:50] <amosbird> grawity: "2x scaling for widgets and fonts" How can I configure that in general?
[10:39:23] <amosbird> btw, "non-blurry option" do you mean an option in the screen itself or X?
[10:39:34] <kib> btw i'm signed in to every other site

[10:39:48] <kib> it seems like *only* google cookies are cleared
[10:40:40] <grawity> amosbird: when you use a lower resolution, I think the scaling is done in hardware, so maybe the per-output "properties" in xrandr could control it, but I'm generally assuming "you get what you get"
[10:41:06] <grawity> amosbird: for scaling the GUI to 2x, https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/HiDPI
[10:41:07] <phrik> Title: HiDPI - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[10:41:11] <kib> my clear cookies option is toggled off and nothing is added to any of the clear cookie fields in "chrome://settings/cookies"
[10:41:38] <grawity> newer apps (gtk3, qt5) handle it much better than old ones

[11:59:31] <Moire9> unsure where to go from here - i do remember that when first installing, getting 4k to work properly was a pain, but i don't remember any specific details; running latest `nvidia` drivers

[19:19:08] <feinedsquirrel> oh, haha, just saw the blog post about it, too. :) Thanks. Looks like it was originally on Debian. Have you migrated it to Arch?
[19:19:15] *** Joins: magnavox (~MagnaVox@user/MagnaVox)
[19:19:39] <feinedsquirrel> oh, maybe your docker image is based on debian?
[19:19:39] <ectospasm> Yes, I migrated to a new VPS, and converted a WordPress site to Ghost when I did.
[19:20:21] *** Quits: codicodi (~codicodi@37.120.211.213) (Remote host closed the connection)
[19:20:23] <ectospasm> So, WordPress was on Debian, and not in a container.  When I set up the new VPS, I installed Arch first, then set up Docker.
[19:20:48] *** Quits: srv (~cmd@user/srv) (Quit: Leaving)
[19:21:06] <feinedsquirrel> got it. nice looking site. i'll keep in touch, if that is ok
[19:21:11] <ectospasm> Then I set up docker containers running Ghost, and transferred the WordPress articles using the Ghost script for that.
[19:21:19] <ectospasm> feinedsquirrel: sure thing!
[19:21:47] <ectospasm> I should probably describe that setup as well.
[19:22:30] <ectospasm> Now I need to go to the grocery!

[23:23:21] <another|> I don't see the use case of manjaro. It's Arch + delay? So stuff might break because of it? Does it handle config files updates?
[23:23:40] <nothereisnotanam> no
[23:23:44] <predicament> i dont remember now it was awhile ago but it does break a lot just simply from updating, especially when i know i did nothing to it before; but i do use manjaro on the rpi

[23:23:52] <nothereisnotanam> its uses plain pacman, so no ocnfig file updates or that stuff

[23:24:05] <another|> So you still need to do stuff yourself like on Arch
[23:24:05] <predicament> and on there it never breaks
[23:24:40] <predicament> well use case is usually um
[23:24:46] <nothereisnotanam> predicament: archlinuxarm exists
[23:24:59] <predicament> yes it does
[23:25:10] <nothereisnotanam> its as stable as arch itself
[23:25:17] <predicament> then im gonna install it

[23:25:31] <nothereisnotanam> the kernel itself is broeken for stuff
[23:25:35] <predicament> god damn it
[23:25:36] <nothereisnotanam> the rpi kernel works
[23:25:36] <predicament> lol
[23:25:42] <predicament> well
[23:25:44] <predicament> fine
[23:25:50] <predicament> we will see then
[23:26:06] <nothereisnotanam> if you instal 'linux-rpi' its really stable
[23:26:21] <nothereisnotanam> cuase thagts the "working" kernel, also the one manjaro uses
[23:26:33] <predicament> then i might as well just use that
[23:27:03] <predicament> and that makes sense because manjaro on there is the only noticable stability i've ran into :P
