[00:45:46] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> @eliyanov because IIRC you have to generate the whole typedef block yourself]
[00:45:47] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> (edit) "yourself]" => "yourself"
[00:45:50] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> I think you can't just do `type Dat = typeDef(@["name"], @["string"])`
[00:45:54] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> you need to return a nimnode
[00:46:05] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> you have to do typedef(Dat, ...) and generate `type Dat` inside of the macro
[00:46:08] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> and it needs to be a statement list
[00:46:26] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> In reply to @Gumber "and it needs to": not neccesarily

[00:46:41] <FromDiscord> <eliyanov> Why does it work with procTy blocks though
[00:46:42] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> yeah you're right
[00:47:00] <FromDiscord> <SivadNai> Ah, it is getUnicodeValue("Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion", "CurrentVersion", registry.HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE)
[00:48:31] <FromDiscord> <SivadNai> I would almost be tempted to update the documentation there
[00:55:28] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> In reply to @eliyanov "Why does it work": I think this is because when you do it with a proc, you're still generating the entire proc inside the macro
[00:55:49] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> if you're putting it on the right hand side of the assignment operator, then you're creating essentially a function pointer
[00:56:11] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> unless you mean you can do like
[00:56:40] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> `type MyFunctionPointerType = genProcHere`
[00:56:47] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> if that's the case, then I don't really have a good explanation
[00:57:15] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> I assume when you asked that question you meant doing something like:â†µâ†µ`var myFunctionPointer = genProcSignatureHere(...)`
[00:57:58] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> although that doesn't even really make sense... I guess I'm not sure what you're trying to do with the `procTy` blocks
[01:02:53] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> In reply to @Gumber "I assume when you": i mean that does make sense since you can make anonymous procs and assign them to variables
[01:03:12] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> yeah true

[09:09:52] <arfy> yeah. it's a nice language so far.
[09:10:37] <arfy> no, although i was very amused by the deduplicate function from sequtils. deduplicate? 
[09:13:22] <arfy> also, under windows, is it possible to use nim with the latest VC++ tools?

[17:01:37] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> there's no "the way to go", there are multiple ORMs available for Nim :)
[17:01:41] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> no one forces you to a specific combination
[17:02:43] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> I personally like ormin too, but there's for example https://github.com/moigagoo/norm
[17:02:46] <nrds> <12R2D299> 4GitHub: 7"A Nim ORM"
[17:03:09] <arkanoid> yeah but I'm not into evolution of nim tools for the web, karax, ormin, jester, norm, fidget, basolato, prologue. I'm getting lost
[17:04:32] *** Joins: pro (~pro@user/pro)
[17:04:34] <arkanoid> I'm aiming to a solution that is more than a poc, and has already been bent to production use. I know just karax and ormin due to nim forum

[17:13:00] <FromDiscord> <gogolxdong (liuxiaodong)> Nim should replace nodejs

[17:18:27] <arkanoid> there must be a "go well together" path. I mean, frontent + backend + orm technologies generally moves as a group, but what is the currente prefence for nim? Maybe Karax + Jester + ormin?
[17:26:57] <FromDiscord> <auxym> I do believe the nim forum runs on karax+jester, not sure for ORM though.
[17:27:08] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> In reply to @auxym "I do believe the": it doesn't use an ORM
[17:27:30] <arkanoid> yeah ORM is not always part of the game
[17:28:03] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> you can check the source, e.g. https://github.com/nim-lang/nimforum/blob/master/src/forum.nim#L662
[17:30:02] <arkanoid> in my opinion, the nim forum way is bad for web development, as it's SEO nightmare: white page without js
[17:32:49] <arkanoid> also reason why you're not finding any answer about nim programming with google on nim forum but just stackoverflow
[17:32:56] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> no, not really
[17:33:01] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> google indexes nim forum just fine

[17:36:35] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> also IIRC even now there's no way to cleanly mix statically rendered and dynamic content in karax

[18:05:35] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> gotcha

[18:06:16] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> yeah - I don't really do web dev with Nim. I already have to do it for work, but... IMO it doesn't really matter what frontend technology or framework or library you use, they're all pretty terrible
[18:06:20] <arkanoid> I'm doing "karun src/webtest.nim"
[18:06:25] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> Karax is at least somewhat lightweight in comparison to a lot of others
[18:07:04] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> all karun does is generate HTML boilerplate coded
[18:07:06] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> (edit) "coded" => "code apparently"
[18:07:14] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> like, you don't even need it really - it's simply there for convenience
[18:07:28] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> You just need to compile your Nim to JS and then have an HTML load the JS file via a script tag
[18:07:58] <FromDiscord> <Gumber aka Zachary Carter> it's just JS and HTML at the end of the day...
[18:08:35] <arkanoid> I'm not a web developer, I've successfully skipped the whole web era as I consider it horror. I've always lived on backend/desktop/console/microcontroller. Occasionally I still want to "know" how to bake basic web apps. I used to play with python + vue, but it's time to replace my last-favorite-thing with something I like, that's nim

[18:21:53] <arkanoid> side question: in vscode F6 runs "nim c ...", how to make it run nimble build/run instead?
[18:22:58] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> I don't think you can change the command that's being run when pressing F6
[18:23:12] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> but you can add specific vscode tasks for Ctrl+F5 (run without debugging) which is a vscode keybind
[18:23:29] <FromDiscord> <fenrave> if you mean with coderunner, you can edit the json file for it to change the command that it runs
[18:23:38] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> In reply to @fenrave "if you mean with": nah, he's talking about the nim extension
[18:24:01] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> both Nim extensions (the pragmagic and saem) have F6 hotkey to run "nim c /path/to/currentFile.nim"
[18:24:42] <FromDiscord> <fenrave> did not know that
[18:25:59] <arkanoid> I'm using the saem one. It has a "build command" option that defaults to "c", but replecing it with "nimble build" results in it trying to run "nim nimble build ..."
[18:26:21] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> ah maybe you can change, lemme check the config
[18:26:52] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> eh, seems like you can't :)
[18:27:05] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> https://github.com/saem/vscode-nim/blob/main/src/nimvscode.nim#L235 it's hardcoded here
[18:27:14] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> (nim saem extension inherited most behaviour from the pragmagic extension)
[18:29:48] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> you can make a PR adding a config variable for that since this extension is written in Nim (and compiled via JS backend)
[18:33:46] <arkanoid> yeah! I've opened an issue to talk about this
[18:33:48] <arkanoid> thanks
[18:36:02] <arkanoid> not the smoothest karax intro experience: this compiles to js but triggers assertionDefect in js https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3yFj
[18:36:17] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> why are you including stdlib modules?
[18:36:20] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> you should import them
[18:36:49] <arkanoid> I was following this tutorial: https://moigagoo.svbtle.com/exploring-karax
[18:37:04] <arkanoid> old, yes, but he is using sugar
[18:37:18] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> but he is importing sugar :)
[18:37:31] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> not sure about the issue itself though
[18:37:45] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> we have a #webdev on discord, I think it's bridged to matrix as well
[18:37:49] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> it's better to ask about karax there
[18:37:55] <arkanoid> is there a difference between "import sugar" and "import std/sugar"?
[18:38:13] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> yes
[18:38:33] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> if you have a file named "sugar.nim" in the same folder as the main file, then "import sugar" will import that local file instead of stdlib
[18:38:49] <arkanoid> sure, but I have just "webtest.nim" in my src
[18:38:53] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> "std" is the stdlib module prefix, and all new modules since 0.20.0 (or near that) are created in std namespace specifically
[18:39:11] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> so it's better to just always use std prefix when importing stdlib modules
[18:39:25] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> You can of course import multiple modules as easily - `import std/[strutils, strscans, httpclient]`
[18:39:28] <arkanoid> yeahm that's why I'm using std/[]
