[00:35:12] <gehn> data science and or machine learning and or artificial intelligence, they're all kind of the same topic and there's no real universal agreement on where one begins and another ends. the big secret google doesn't want you to know is that at the end of the day it's all "advanced applied statistics", not some magic sauce
[00:35:36] <ljharb> lantech19446: definitely JS
[00:35:39] <gehn> python doesn't have quite the same facilities available for UI work or desktop apps

[00:40:34] <ljharb> also true
[00:41:37] <ljharb> humanBird: also, backend dev is much easier and takes much less skill and rigor than frontend dev - because in backend dev, you have one controlled environment, and in frontend dev, you have infinite uncontrolled environments.
[00:42:30] <lantech19446> I don't need to be super programmer of notoriety I need to be good enough to be employed whether that be for a firm a business or freelance
[00:42:42] <humanBird> why is there only one javascript but dozens of python/java/c++/c/sql/mssql/postgres/mariadb/mysql etc etc etc?
[00:42:50] <gehn> lantech19446, JS will do well for you then, tons of JS jobs
[00:43:02] <humanBird> front end pays less than back end for a reason
[00:43:03] <gehn> tons of python jobs too, but if you care less about data science, definitely learn JS
[00:43:06] <humanBird> well, many reasons
[00:44:23] <ljharb> humanBird: frontend doesn't pay less than backend everywhere.
[00:44:34] <gehn> a person's pay can be fairly reliably predicted based on a range of factors such as level of education, years of experience and negotiation ability. "frontend vs backend" is not part of that mathematical model.
[00:44:38] <ljharb> ^
[00:44:45] <ljharb> also, by location
[00:44:51] <humanBird> we're not talking about exceptions.  in general, we all know that front end devs get paid less than back end devs.
[00:45:01] <ljharb> humanBird: that's a false and falsifiable statement
[00:45:09] <ljharb> humanBird: we don't all know that, because it's not true.
[00:45:21] <ljharb> humanBird: but also, rate of pay is not correlated with skill or talent
[00:45:36] <ljharb> humanBird: garbagemen get paid way more than teachers, but nobody would claim it's easier to be a teacher than a garbage man
[00:45:58] <ThePendulum> might be that there are more basic javascript projects available for the front-end that don't require as much experience
[00:46:14] <ljharb> also that
[00:46:21] <ThePendulum> whereas the threshold for back-end is a bit higher, but those working on elaborate front-end projects don't get paid less
[00:46:33] <humanBird> i'm not going to argue the FACT that on average, front end devs are paid less. i've seen payroll at multiple companies.
[00:46:37] <ljharb> it's not a fact
[00:46:47] <ljharb> humanBird: what you just described is called an "anecdote"
[00:46:49] <gehn> I mean, overall, as a language becomes more popular, you get more devs learning it because of its job prospects, and more jobs hiring for it because of same
[00:47:06] *** Joins: cmbengue (~Thunderbi@207.191.249.160)
[00:47:08] <ThePendulum> I've been working full-stack for most of my freelance career, I would think at some point someone should have inquired whether I can divide my work in front and back-end on the invoice
[00:47:15] <ljharb> lol
[00:47:24] <gehn> which means supply begins to outstrip demand, so you find a lot more low paying jobs in a "popular" language like PHP or JS or Python than you do in a language like Haskell or OCaml
[00:47:31] <ThePendulum> but so far no one has questioned the fact I have the same rate for whatever I'm doing
[00:47:35] <ljharb> ThePendulum: do it, you'll be able to charge a much higher rate for the frontend part, because that's harder and more valuabel

[00:49:58] <ljharb> ThePendulum: the same risks exist with either
[00:50:07] <gehn> seems frontend fuck-ups can do that as well. evidence: the politician suing someone for inspecting source
[00:50:09] <ljharb> ThePendulum: the difference is that it's WAY easier to automate prevention of those bugs on the backend
[00:50:31] <ljharb> you can't actually protect against XSS without tons of code review and manual techniques
[00:50:45] <ljharb> on the backend tho, there's tons of easy methods
[00:51:45] <samsch> I think there may be a pay correlation, but it's more like on both front and back, you have people who want the cheapest (up front, not medium or long term) solution. In the front end, that's a developer because there aren't automation tools that actually... work. On the backend those same bad decision makers can be like Firebase! And then they make the front end dev try to wire it up.

[04:11:45] <Tabmow> Is there a recommended way to check for a valid token when doing api calls and then redirecting to a login screen rather than a silent 403 unauthorized from the backend?
[04:13:58] *** Quits: sam_1 (~sam_1@87.51.251.118) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[04:15:08] <ljharb> Tabmow: it's only silent if the api client doesn't do anything when it happens
[04:16:18] <ljharb> Tabmow: also you want 401 in that case; 403 is when they're authorized but don't individually have access

[04:18:11] <Tabmow> ljharb: yeah it's a 401 after the token expires... my bad. Ok, so basically I should just wrap my axios calls in some logic to check for that?
[04:19:41] <poiqwepoiqwe> axios.post().then(function (response) {
[04:19:49] <poiqwepoiqwe> check there
[04:21:41] <Tabmow> Right... I'd need to go the same for get calls too - is there a way to do this once globally or will I need to update each axios call?
[04:22:29] <D4mned> each call is different

[04:23:26] <D4mned> maybe you wanna display some messages

[04:53:26] <D4mned> interceptors is like a middleware for axios ?
[04:55:15] <poiqwepoiqwe> interceptors process a response before catch, then
[04:55:51] <D4mned> cool
[04:56:59] <poiqwepoiqwe> attach to axios instance and Tabmow can have a "global" 401 logic

[05:00:48] <Tabmow> Interesting, I'll see if I can find something that Vue has or else I'll go down the axios interceptor path.
[05:02:48] <Tabmow> Actually, I already have checks in Vue for protected routes etc. - so if I go to a route and the token is expired it redirects to the login page. However this is for when I am staying on the same route and retrieving data from the backend. I guess the only way to do this is with the axios interceptors.
[05:04:33] <poiqwepoiqwe> axios interceptors seem very straight forward. should be too taxing

[12:46:12] <theskillwithin> fonts and css are not easy.  trying to match a figma design font seems like would be easy, but no

[12:48:34] <stenno\OK> i am talking about transforming existing text
[12:48:38] <fweht> ah sorry
[12:48:45] <stenno\OK> or setting the transforms first and then drawing the text
[12:49:26] <stenno\OK> if you add Ê to the filltext fill you see it being pushed down
[12:49:40] <fweht> yeah, but since the baseline is part of the font (as far as i know, every font can set its own baseline), its weird that i cant just say hey, print this font here and fix the baseline at 70px from the top of the div/canvas

[15:19:30] <Cork> gde33: a browser has no consept of a text file, its a content-type, so it depends on what the server sends in the http header
[15:20:01] <gde33> right

[15:20:55] <gde33> you mean input to large?

[17:24:26] <gkatsev> get a laser printer
[17:24:28] <thykka> they say it expires :P
[17:24:37] <thykka> hence it has to be replaced, whether it's finished or not
[17:24:41] <thykka> but it's a known racket
[17:25:07] <thykka> generally cheaper to buy a new printer every time, rather than buy replacement carts
[17:25:07] <gkatsev> liquid ink dries out
[17:25:11] <theskillwithin> if i get another printer, it will just be black and white,  then impossible to scam
[17:25:31] <gkatsev> b&w brother laser printer is what I would recommend
[17:25:55] <theskillwithin> it should be illegal to disable black and white if ur color dries out
[17:26:27] <thykka> and yet it's probably illegal to modify the firmware :P

[17:27:38] <thykka> and people bought it

[19:42:38] <prussian> I just have a thermal printer on my desk for labels.
[19:42:46] <joepie91> and hey, the stereotype of germans is that they build it well, not that what they build is from this decade :p
[19:42:51] <prussian> my paper is my ink.
[19:42:58] <samsch> prussian, She was thinking about getting a label printer specifically
[19:43:06] <prussian> joepie91: you know those germans make good stuff.
[19:43:08] <ljharb> joepie91: p sure everyone expects mercedezeses to be modern

[19:43:32] <prussian> at least in my opinion
[19:43:32] <stenno\OK> for anything bad happening over the wifi connection
[19:43:35] <stenno\OK> well yeah
[19:43:36] <prussian> but it's pretty common
[19:43:39] <stenno\OK> you were responsible for it
[19:43:47] <ljharb> stenno\OK: as you should be
[19:43:47] <joepie91> also, printer-wise, do yourself a favour and buy a brother
[19:43:53] <prussian> if all you care about is Latin-1 plain text printing, go for them though.
[19:43:54] <stenno\OK> so _nobody_ offered a free wifi
[19:44:19] <stenno\OK> ljharb: nowadays its the actual person using the wifi for ilicit stuff who gets punished
[19:44:24] <joepie91> brother seems to literally be the only brand that people don't instinctively recoil about
[19:44:33] <prussian> apple sort of forced all generic "wifi" printers to support IPP and built in PS/PDF renderer nowadays.
[19:44:37] <ljharb> stenno\OK: yeah fair, it’s more complex than either of us just said i gusss
[19:44:38] <joepie91> (and my own experiences match that :p)
[19:44:45] <prussian> so I don't think it matters if it's brother or not.
[19:45:07] <stenno\OK> ljharb: you have to pay ~20/~30 euro per month for like 4 GB of mobile data
[19:45:19] <ljharb> nah I’ve had lots of bad experiences with brother printers
