[01:01:04] <brainwash> why do the chinese add those weird chemicals to their electronics?
[01:01:30] <brainwash> my friend bought a chinese keyboard and the smell of it made my head spin
[01:02:02] <brainwash> I told him to refund it
[01:04:48] <Miyukii> because they use plastic that's 2% cheaper but somewhat toxic to humans

[01:07:25] <brainwash> aren't there any regulations?

[01:07:31] <Miyukii> yes
[01:07:37] <Miyukii> there are regulations
[01:07:44] <Miyukii> no china doesn't keep to them
[01:08:18] <brainwash> this is bad
[01:08:22] <Miyukii> look at the european CE certification vs the chinese CE China Export brand
[01:09:28] <brainwash> the cheap chinese stuff should not be able to pass the european border then
[01:09:30] <Miyukii> random stuff you barely use isn't much of a problem, or anything metal
[01:10:20] <Miyukii> plastics can give off a lot of nasty stuff when it comes in contact with skin grease

[01:11:15] <Miyukii> if you buy them from aliexpress I imagine you'll have a bad time

[14:53:16] <sentionics> was drunk, and my friend let me take a hit of this weed.
[14:53:17] <emmeka> brainwash sunflowers are indigenous to the tallgrass prairie and to this date that is the heart of where they are grown, the tallgrass prairie regions of Manitoba.
[14:53:20] <sentionics> one hit, and I was out

[14:55:03] <emmeka> brainwash yes, apples are from the highlands of Kazakhstan
[14:55:17] <emmeka> brainwash to my knowledge the only major exception is beets
[14:55:20] <emmeka> beets are European
[14:55:29] <Macer> it only takes one look at a meth addict or a pcp addict to know to never use those particular drugs
[14:55:33] <Macer> beets are gross

[14:56:15] <amigojapan> sentionics: I think sometimes weed is laced
[14:56:16] <emmeka> brainwash strawberries are circumboreal, they are native worldwide in the temperate northern hemisphere
[14:56:17] <Macer> isn't a strawberry considered a rose?

[14:56:31] <amigojapan> Hi sentionics 
[14:56:34] <emmeka> strawberries are rosaceae family, but so are most fruits
[14:56:35] <sentionics> ah, maybe that could have been what happened
[14:56:37] <Macer> and the only reason i ask that is because of kara no kyoukai lol
[14:56:43] <sentionics> amigo, I'm very happy to see you
[14:56:44] <emmeka> raspberries, apples, pears, plums, etc are all rose family
[14:56:54] <Macer> apples?
[14:56:55] <brainwash> rose?!
[14:56:57] <sentionics> didn't think I was gonna get through that one
[14:57:13] <brainwash> I don't mind them being roses
[14:57:14] <Macer> apples are so treelike tho 
[14:57:15] <amigojapan> Thanks sentionics , I am glad to see you too
[14:57:29] <emmeka> Macer yep. the vast majority of fruit-bearing crops domesticated by humanity are rose family plants.

[17:14:44] <JesseDesu> =/
[17:15:01] <ButterNoodle> 1,1 making sure my colors work
[17:15:07] <JesseDesu> also mommy shinoaki is milf
[17:15:43] <ButterNoodle> 1,1 what a lil bitch.. literally kill his daughter to back in time to get that feeling back... after being a try hard and making all the people he looked up to as a looser, turn into loosers... he gets the cute girl, and the cute daughter..
[17:16:22] <ButterNoodle> 1,1 he might as well grab a coat hanger and kill her in advance. anyway what a shit specimin of a human being, gotta get that kmochi back baby..
[17:16:43] <JesseDesu> thats a pretty strong opinion
[17:16:51] <JesseDesu> it may be valid
[17:17:02] <JesseDesu> at the same time
[17:17:08] <ButterNoodle> 1,1 and u know he gonna fuck up getting the girl on re re do.. because once something is observed its measure changes - tldr cuck probably wants to watch someone else fuck his girl and that killed his child - i.e. it will never be born
[17:17:41] <ButterNoodle> 1,1 not a total shit show because we got kawaii aoikami musumechan, but I rate it 1 out of 4 cocksuckers (more is better)
[17:17:50] <ButterNoodle> anyway
[17:17:54] <JesseDesu> ok
[17:17:55] <ButterNoodle> u know I have strong opinions
[17:18:10] <JesseDesu> like i said

[20:54:44] <brainwash> aren't parents supposed to look over your shoulder while you use the internet at the age of 11?
[20:54:44] <MootPoot> I was like "damn adults be crazy" then went back to playing runescape
[20:54:54] <Bco1981> zoidberg: i think that's too story driven, english isn't so easy for him to read yet.
[20:55:00] <MootPoot> are they?
[20:55:07] <brainwash> I thought so
[20:55:07] <Roey> MootPoot: oh, I bet we're around the same age (I'm 41)

[20:55:42] <MootPoot> if I was born now I would be fappin to milfs at 6yo
[20:55:49] <brainwash> and hentai sites are just two clicks away
[20:55:55] <Bco1981> Roey: my sons class mates have started to watch some anime, so my son wanted to watch attack on titans. but i think he should be older for that one. he is 12.
[20:55:57] <brainwash> exactly
[20:56:05] <zoidberg> I mean to get him a better taste of anime. The finest things first or something like that
[20:56:26] <MootPoot> Sword Art Online

[20:57:22] <Roey> bco1981: what is it like as a father to keep your 12-year-old son away from sex on the Internet?
[20:57:31] <MootPoot> show him the proper sex sites
[20:57:35] <Roey> :P
[20:57:51] <MootPoot> how to not get viruses while looking up milf tiddies

[20:58:15] <Roey> <MootPoot> how to not get viruses while looking up milfutanari tiddies 
[20:58:24] <brainwash> I'd rather bond with my daughter
[20:58:34] <Bco1981> Roey: don't know, i don't see him doing that. at home on the pc, he practically can't on the phone, he can if he is not on the wifi. but i don't know if he does.
[20:58:51] <Bco1981> i would think some of his classmates already found stuff.
[20:58:51] <zoidberg> Bco1981: is dragon ball z available in your native language?

[21:01:45] <brainwash> isn't it risky to introduce your son to anime? he might become a pedophile later on
[21:01:51] <MootPoot> Soon my phone will become my isekai waifu
[21:01:52] <Bco1981> i had "heard" about android 18...

[21:02:01] <MootPoot> Bco1981: hehe
[21:02:19] <zoidberg> Android 17 or 18 wakes android 16 just out of curiosity Bco1981

[21:03:29] <brainwash> you want to have a son who is into loli sex?
[21:03:30] <MootPoot> with a proper diet of milf tiddies and college age maids, he will be kept on the right track
[21:03:35] <Bco1981> he will make up his own mind
[21:03:46] <Bco1981> but he seems interested in boobs
[21:03:48] <MootPoot> each nut to their own
[21:04:00] <Bco1981> so... not loli enthusiat yet.
[21:04:16] <Bco1981> enthusiast*
[21:04:20] <MootPoot> lolis are weird anyway
[21:04:24] <zoidberg> the only problem will be his son will use anime lingo at home or to his father
[21:04:26] <MootPoot> have you ever seen a kid irl

[21:06:25] <Bco1981> ah
[21:06:28] <MootPoot> sounds like you've had kids suck you dry before
[21:06:30] <MootPoot> LOL
[21:06:46] <MootPoot> I meant that one way but it sounds like another
[21:07:31] <MootPoot> anyway, we need another topic before the FBI starts raiding us
[21:07:33] <zoidberg> when my niece was around 3 year old, she cried because she wanted to eat the piece of mango I already ate
[21:07:45] <MootPoot> zoidberg: hurk it up like a momma bird for her
[21:08:24] <zoidberg> and the other time she cried because we wouldn't let her eat garbage
[21:08:31] <zoidberg> lol MootPoot

[21:09:49] <zoidberg> Bco1981: 4-5 years old, not sure
[21:11:06] <zoidberg> the problem is she is the only kid in our and in in-laws house so she get to rule everyone like queen
[21:11:31] <MootPoot> ah
[21:11:39] <MootPoot> I've had that happen once before
[21:11:43] <zoidberg> tbh I am also same, just can't let her be sad
[21:11:57] <MootPoot> although I'm a bit of a cunt at times
[21:14:02] <zoidberg> really? you remember? I don't remember anything below 5 years old
[21:14:24] <MootPoot> oh no, I mean dealing with a kid that alwasys get what they want
[21:14:30] <MootPoot> you just dont give in 
[21:14:37] <MootPoot> and dont give any leniency
[21:14:52] <zoidberg> but she's cute!
[21:15:01] <MootPoot> its a bit of a pain but they'll get the point...make sure there is a carrot waiting for them after they comply with what you want
[21:15:17] <MootPoot> not flexing / being strict with no carrot is a fools errand
[21:15:18] <MootPoot> imo
[21:15:36] <zoidberg> that's easy to say but hard to implement
[21:15:45] <MootPoot> eh, I've done it before
[21:15:48] <MootPoot> not too hard really
[21:16:23] <MootPoot> kid wants X, you say you give X when they do Y , and dont budge...but when they do Y, give them X+1 to really rub in the positive reinforcement

[21:19:12] <zoidberg> yes
[21:19:14] <MootPoot> and getting X+1 has the same mental value as getting X for them
[21:19:18] <MootPoot> not so for humans
[21:19:24] <MootPoot> humans will remember getting X+1
[21:19:51] <MootPoot> Just make sure you never budge, now or in the future, or you can forget about all of your progress

[21:26:41] <MootPoot> lol
[21:26:42] <MootPoot> thats it
[21:26:59] <ButterNoodle> so many here are not equipped to take care of healthy children..
[21:27:14] <MootPoot> basically just how to calm down a kid and how to manage them without whacking em
[21:27:20] <MootPoot> although most other things I figured out on the fly
[21:27:29] <MootPoot> like how to make a point, get them to do stuff
[21:27:39] <zoidberg> I bet many of them aren't even qualified to be parents but this is a free world
[21:27:48] <ButterNoodle> true
[21:27:51] <ButterNoodle> very true
[21:27:51] <MootPoot> at one point I was like a squad leader of hyper-focused little midgets

[21:28:14] <zoidberg> and seeing how the world is heading towards and how life
[21:28:48] <zoidberg> not having kids is pretty good life choice
[21:28:56] <ButterNoodle> yea
[21:29:42] <Bco1981> i had a coworker thet kept saying, the optimal number of kids, is 0.
[21:29:47] <Bco1981> he has 4 now.
[21:29:59] <zoidberg> but one never knows these things, my friend was like me but he accidentally got his wife pregnant
[21:30:06] <zoidberg> and now he is father
[21:30:09] <zoidberg> lol
[21:30:13] <Bco1981> "accidentally"
[21:30:14] <ButterNoodle> we are genetically programmed to love our offspring.. but damn, I'd hit the unfuck button and run if it were possible
[21:30:28] <MootPoot> idk, I feel like I already have low energy as it is, I can't handle kids
[21:30:54] <MootPoot> but on a mental maturity point, I could do it...and because I think I'm mature enough I dont want them now
[21:30:55] <ButterNoodle> yea that whole plan to have kids thing only happens to a small portion of the population
[21:30:57] <MootPoot> lol

[21:47:50] <TsundereNoises> I think curry as we generally think of it originated in India, but a lot of curry is like 18th century English interpretation of curry as it evolved elsewhere
[21:48:02] <TsundereNoises> in another sense, curry is just stew, which is as old as fire
[21:48:36] <TsundereNoises> so many different types of curry
[21:48:40] <EdgyMC_69> btw, do people really eat dry rice 
[21:48:46] <EdgyMC_69> like, something + rice on the side
[21:48:58] <EdgyMC_69> aren't they like really thirsty because of the rice?
[21:48:59] <zoidberg> TsundereNoises: If texas chilli was made in India, it would be called curry

[21:50:19] <EdgyMC_69> so I have basmatic rice 
[21:50:26] <EdgyMC_69> is that indian rice orrrr what
[21:50:26] <TsundereNoises> basmati*
[21:50:43] <TsundereNoises> it's a specific variety of rice, the grains are longer, the flavor is a bit different
[21:50:45] <MootPoot> ass mati
[21:50:46] <EdgyMC_69> and it's pretty nice, better than the one my mom used
[21:50:54] <zoidberg> EdgyMC_69: it is more like a brand of rice, like cuppa soup
[21:50:57] <TsundereNoises> EdgyMC_69: there are actually a lot of different types of rice
[21:51:03] <MootPoot> spank that rice, go against the grain
[21:51:28] <zoidberg> basmati is high polished afaik
[21:51:33] <EdgyMC_69> rice is complicated then
[21:51:45] <TsundereNoises> zoidberg: I don't know about in India, but it's not trademarked in the US/Europe, it's a variety
[21:51:46] <zoidberg> I usually eat brown rice
[21:51:46] <EdgyMC_69> I thought it was so nice to have a rice cooker and just dump rice into it

[21:54:55] <zoidberg> EdgyMC_69: you can cook any curry at home, here's a simple recipe which works for every curry: add veggies, onions, saute them, add some traditional indian spices (sesame seeds, corriander and stuff), a bit of salt, chilli and roasted peanut powder
[21:55:01] <MootPoot> Bco1981: be a proper racist and judge pussi from the outside, not the inside
[21:55:05] <TsundereNoises> I guess I have 5 kinds of rice in my apartment actually
[21:55:10] <EdgyMC_69> okay
[21:55:20] <TsundereNoises> if we count wild rice (which isn't rice, TECHNICALLY)
[21:56:18] <TsundereNoises> zoidberg: I think that's gonna be shit for a lot of people if they aren't confident what indian spices are or what ratio to use, spices are such a big deal to curry
[21:56:55] <TsundereNoises> zoidberg: reminds me of my grandmother's recipes, most just list "flour" with no amount because she used the amount that made the dough look right, duh

[23:43:14] <Bco1981> sounds like sweden
[23:43:17] <Matt|home> but it'd also be nice if they had internet, running water, and a population not full of crazy people
[23:43:29] <Bco1981> thou i don't know about the job thing
[23:43:53] <senti> they have a lot of that. I don't know anything about German people, but surely they're not as crazy as us Americans.
[23:44:16] <senti> are they?
[23:45:37] <isekaijin> Last time they tried being a little bit crazy, it did not end so well, lol.
[23:45:49] <senti> Bco1981: well as a software developer, Matt can work from home
[23:46:21] <isekaijin> Yup, seems like a job doable from home.
