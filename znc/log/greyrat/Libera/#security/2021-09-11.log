[07:19:24] <catbeard> but you could reverse proxy and correctly route things if you know how to on a single v4/v6
[07:19:33] <KryptoK> so lets say I have a pbx running on port 5060 and https webserver running on 443
[07:19:41] <KryptoK> i can run them on the same ip address

[07:20:22] <catbeard> same as you would subinterfaces with v4
[07:20:27] <KryptoK> make a nat rule for 443 to go to web server
[07:20:40] <catbeard> or you could do SNI Hostname based routing
[07:21:04] <Hash> so you get a 4 to 6 tunnel? get a /48, and then bind what exactly to the ipv6 iface?
[07:21:13] <KryptoK> make some cname for pbx and and web server.  Several names on the same ip but using diff ports
[07:21:27] <jessicara> is up to you how deal it out
[07:21:49] <catbeard> so if you don't have native v6, having a tunnel broker will allow you to sub-delegate a v6 range from the tunnel interface
[07:21:55] <jessicara> if it's just 10 with specific names, static isn't unreasonable

Let's say some attacker compromise WebServerA, then access ComputerB with an ssh brute force attack and finally access ComputerC with a key stolen on computerB from WebServerA, would the last step be considered a "lateral movement" from WebServerA to "ComputerC"?

[13:32:04] <dob1> dodo, yes it is

[13:34:06] <dodo> dob1: looks like an invalid request anyway
[13:34:20] <dodo> probably trying to exploit some http
[13:34:48] <dob1> dodo, but every quest has to have a method, right?   it's a loggin problem maybe
[13:34:49] <dodo> the method would be part of the request, like "GET /", but they just sent ";sh+/tmp/gpon80&ipv=0"
[13:34:52] <dodo> no
[13:35:05] <dodo> dob1: you can e.g. use telnet to make requests by hand
[13:35:11] <dodo> GET / will return that page
[13:35:13] <catbeard> 400 bad request is OK, as long as it wasn't 200 :)
[13:35:32] <dob1> but GET /  you are doing a GET
[13:35:47] <dodo> but "GET /" is just a string
[13:35:52] <dodo> you can send anything there
[13:35:54] <catbeard> dob1: you can spoof the request method
[13:36:09] <catbeard> and just send a nonexistant verb over the wire
[13:36:22] <dob1> maybe it has to go to error.log not to access.log then
[13:36:24] <catbeard> hence the 400
[13:36:35] *** Joins: SEP (~stephenle@71-135-151-245.lightspeed.frokca.sbcglobal.net)
[13:36:37] <dodo> i think error log is for internal errors
[13:36:43] <dodo> bad request is client error
[13:36:53] <dodo> or where do they put 404s?
[13:36:54] <catbeard> it's not a valid request verb so it got rejected by nginx
[13:37:07] <dodo> yeah, access log
[13:37:51] <dob1> I got it, thanks for explanation
[13:37:52] <catbeard> be more concerned if you find php code tags in your logs

[19:30:34] <anniea> its linux
[19:31:18] <SineDeviance> anniea: that's probably a bridge interface, i.e. two interfaces bridged together
[19:31:29] <SineDeviance> do you have a hypervisor setup on your machine?
[19:34:27] <anniea> a vpn SineDeviance
[19:34:49] <SineDeviance> then that's why
[19:35:27] <anniea> ok then I feel better, it's a new GUI cause of a upgrade so
[19:35:29] <anniea> thanks
[19:36:06] <SineDeviance> I am not sure why you have a bridge interface though, might be needed by your VPN implementation for split-tunnel?

[19:48:42] <shibboleth> also also: vpn bridging is almost always a bad idea
[19:49:09] <shibboleth> you're more likely to want vpn routing
[19:49:36] <SineDeviance> shibboleth: I mean... that depends. if you want a flat site-to-site VPN, bridging is fine :)
[19:49:40] <anniea> spent a whole day just getting it working lol
[19:49:56] <shibboleth> and clog the vpn link with l2 traffic?
[19:50:12] <anniea> afraid to touch it, break it again
[19:51:31] <SineDeviance> shibboleth: if you have applications that need to use non-IP protocols, like IPX or something else, you need bridged. you also need bridged if you want to run applications that rely on network broadcasts, or use peer-to-peer Windows filesharing without a central SMB server
[19:51:49] <SineDeviance> just saying there are use cases
[19:52:03] <SineDeviance> for someone who just wants more privacy in their net traffic, bridged is a bad idea
[19:52:38] <anniea> vpn provider indicates "no leaks" but
[19:53:07] <SineDeviance> anniea: what are you using the VPN for? just for privacy?
[19:53:31] <anniea> there are 4 interfaces, wan, wan6, br-lan, and the wireguard
[19:53:54] <anniea> yes, just so ISP see's less or so mostly
[19:53:59] <SineDeviance> anniea: once again - what are you using the VPN for? do you have multiple houses/sites and this a site-to-site VPN, or...
[19:54:00] <SineDeviance> okay
[19:54:14] <SineDeviance> then yes, you should be running your VPN in routed mode
[19:54:36] <SineDeviance> in bridged mode, anything on your local LAN is theoretically exposed to your VPN and routing traffic through it
[19:54:41] <anniea> shoot, ok guess i'll have to see if I missed something
[19:55:15] <shibboleth> SineDeviance, if you're doing serverless smb/cifs shares then a vpn sounds too advanced for said org :P
[19:55:27] <SineDeviance> shibboleth: shhh :)
[19:55:54] <SineDeviance> You're totally right of course, but I have had some strange requests from clients in my career
[19:56:08] <SineDeviance> especially since the pandemic started
[19:56:25] *** Quits: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[19:57:05] <SineDeviance> i had one client that wanted me to setup each employee's home ISP router to be VPN'd with their corporate network so employees could "share resources they have at home" (like printers and things)
[19:57:38] <SineDeviance> I was like "Uh... 1. it doesn't work like that and 2. that is an absolutely terrible idea as far as security and network performance goes"
[19:57:39] <anniea> I'm not really using a local LAN though
[19:57:59] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[19:58:03] <anniea> just AP for devices to route to the internet via the vpn
[19:58:24] <SineDeviance> anniea: wireless is just the transmission medium, that is still your local LAN
[19:58:31] <SineDeviance> you can call it WLAN if you want, but it's the same thing
[19:59:37] <SineDeviance> if you want everything on your network to run through an always-on VPN, you can do it either way - bridged or routed
[20:00:07] <SineDeviance> routed would be more secure, you'd have less sideband chatter 'leaking' through the tunnel
[20:01:14] <SineDeviance> if you're going to go to all this trouble, consider spinning up a PiHole with recursive DNS (unbound) as well. this will block any ads or telemetry requests you specify via the lists (i.e. smart TV telemetry, android telemetry, etc)
[20:01:41] <SineDeviance> Then you can setup client VPN on your router and connect to it from anywhere with your phone/laptop for safe, untracked browsing wherever you are
[20:02:39] <anniea> well I think I'm fine with the router method, just the firmware has updates and the peer occasionally borked and I have to spend hours sorting it out
[20:03:02] <anniea> i may have missed some config box in Luci
[20:03:18] <SineDeviance> that sounds like a broken mess to be honest, i'd wipe that router and use the VPN on a per-client basis
[20:03:47] <SineDeviance> whatever you setup, it needs to be reliable. if it's not, it's not worth doing
[20:03:53] <anniea> been there, done that ; that has its own time consumption
[20:04:17] <anniea> I can just not flash as often
[20:04:57] <SineDeviance> ^which can potentially open you up to security vulnerabilities that haven't been patched in your current firmware
[20:05:10] <SineDeviance> like I said - whatever you setup needs to be reliable. this also includes serviceability
[20:05:14] <anniea> yes, but its all relative
[20:05:21] <SineDeviance> not to me it isn't
[20:05:28] <anniea> how many home users ever flash a router
[20:05:28] <SineDeviance> security is the #1 priority for me

[23:02:00] <foo> ajak: because there are digital signatures, primarily
[23:02:15] <foo> eg. I sign something via Adobe and insert my digital signature
[23:02:29] <ajak> i don't see why this necessitates encryption
[23:02:55] <foo> ajak: that's partly what I'm looking for here, a sanity check.
[23:03:02] <foo> ajak: I wasn't sure how sensitive I should hold a digital signature
[23:03:11] <foo> Social security number is another dynamic... but signatures, meh.
[23:03:16] <foo> Not sure how much I should care
[23:03:21] <ajak> signatures don't sound like secrets to me
[23:03:31] <foo> ajak: appreciate the thoughts, thanks
[23:04:09] <pycurious1> ajak: my problem is that there are three vpns we need on this machine from 3 different companies
