[02:44:13] <Activ8> nice
[02:44:49] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> and if I build up the o365 mail message thing I'll do a couple of secrets and authorised machines and make it so it's usable for other things with an api call to send emails from other tools later

[02:45:29] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> but I've run with on-prem exchange, hyper-v and no experience with web stuff that was usable before, so it's all just 'build as you learn" which annoys the fuck out of me

Because of this, their digestive system can move quite quickly, which means they defecate often. It is speculated that house flies defecate every time they land, even if it’s on their next meal!

[05:21:47] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Flies don’t have teeth. Instead, they have a long tongue called a proboscis, which sucks up food like a straw. Some flies drink nectar or blood. House flies like the food we eat. When a fly lands on your lunch, it vomits on the food. Acids in the vomit dissolve the food so the fly can suck it up. Disgusting!

[06:57:25] <Cl0udNinja> sorta, but so does most PXE unless everything is properly automated
[06:58:21] <Cl0udNinja> you can automate the fog interaction with api access, or manipulate the pxe boot menu with mac based shit and dhcp shenanigans
[07:01:46] <Cl0udNinja> also the systems you're talking about would need to be iPXE capable to be remotely imaged
[07:02:05] <Cl0udNinja> without having a local pxe server setup somewhere near the customer
[07:04:30] <sd> 11<H​otmess> theoretically you can remote image something using uefi and a vpn
[07:04:38] <Cl0udNinja> oh jesus
[07:04:44] <sd> 11<H​otmess> but ive yet to see an implementation that can do that
[07:04:56] <Cl0udNinja> in the words of a gif I found earlier today
[07:04:56] <sd> 11<H​otmess> uuid rather than mac
[07:05:02] <Cl0udNinja> Id rather put a campfire out with my face
[07:05:21] <sd> 11<H​otmess> well you still have to disable secure boot to image a machine via pxe 😦
[07:05:34] <xe0n> what
[07:05:37] <repozitor> Cl0udNinja, So you mean by correct configuration of PXE+FogProject I can reinstall an image without ANY human interaction, right?
[07:06:09] <repozitor> all access that I have is to force my customer to reboot the laptop due to timeout.
[07:06:26] <sd> 11<H​otmess> the device probably wont look for pxe boot
[07:06:34] <Cl0udNinja> repozitor, you still have to reboot the target system, but that could be scheduled, and some api automation for image selection, yeah
[07:06:37] <repozitor> and after this, I have a PXE booted system. But I can not press any key or read something.
[07:06:50] <Cl0udNinja> thats why you need kvm/ipmi to the system
[07:06:52] <sd> 11<H​otmess> as its huge security vulnerability to pxe boot
[07:06:55] <repozitor> I need a fully automated and unattended procedure.
[07:07:01] <Cl0udNinja> ok
[07:07:09] <Cl0udNinja> so you accomplish taht with a kickstart or unattended install shit
[07:08:15] <Cl0udNinja> repozitor, stick around, I'm gaming atm, but I can explain more later
[07:08:37] <repozitor> Cl0udNinja, Sure thanks bro.

[08:36:35] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Some fly species—including bee flies, hoverflies, and midges—serve as pollinators for a variety of plants that are not attractive to bees.
