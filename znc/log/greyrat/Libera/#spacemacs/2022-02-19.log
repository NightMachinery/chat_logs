[01:39:10] <FromGitter> <davidpiano> I spoke too soon - this is strange - now Emacs only works on the first run, the time when spaceline-all-the-icons and all-the-icons actually get installed. Subsequent restarts stall and show the error. Excluding the two packages doesn't fix the problem. Installing them does fix it but only for one time.
[01:46:01] <FromGitter> <davidpiano> But... If I comment out all items in dotspacemacs-startup-lists , Spacemacs starts up fine.
[01:59:19] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> Post your `SPC h I`
[02:00:13] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> @davidpiano also  ‚èé  ‚èé 1) are you running in daemon? ‚èé 2) is native-comp enabled? ‚èé 3) what's in your `dotspacemacs-excluded-packages` [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=62101df5257a357825ef024d]
[02:22:21] <FromGitter> <GuessWhatBBQ> Is there an equivalent to neoscroll or vim-smoothie in emacs ? I tried reading the emacs wiki smoothscrolling section but ended up more confused.
[02:26:04] <FromGitter> <GuessWhatBBQ> Essentially a way to make evil-scroll-down/up motions to have a smoother movement instead of being so abrupt.
[02:29:40] <FromGitter> <davidpiano> Search your .spacemacs file for "dotspacemacs-smooth-scrolling", all you should need is to activate it if it wasn't already.
[02:31:24] <FromGitter> <davidpiano> If you're using Emacs without Spacemacs, the answer must therefore be yes, but I don't know the details.

[06:42:51] <FromGitter> <davidpiano> (require 'all-the-icons)
[06:43:16] <FromGitter> <davidpiano> to my .spacemacs has cleared up everything
[06:43:55] <FromGitter> <davidpiano> Works fine now so I don't want to pursue it any further
[07:16:39] <FromGitter> <davidpiano> Just to cover the easy parts though: I've never enabled native-comp, so unless it's a default setting I'm not using it. Not running in daemon. Excluded packages: vi-tilde-fringe.

[08:45:50] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I guess it's a error introduced in the fix ...
[08:46:37] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> basically I should use `defmacro` instead of `defun`. (which I did use the correctly one when testing but I pushed the wrong one somehow)
[10:04:06] <FromGitter> <davidpiano> I believe we are all talking about the same thing, yes. Thank you for looking deeper into it, even though I'm satisfied with the quick and dirty fix (require 'all-the-icons)

[12:42:08] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> buy a larger display or an extra display, so that you don't need keep scrolling in the first place

[19:44:09] <FromGitter> <aurabindo:matrix.org> Hi, I updated spacemacs develop branch yesterday and `SPC SPC` failing to bringup the mini buffer. I have this in the messages buffer: `SPC SPC-  which-key: There are no keys to show `
[19:44:30] <FromGitter> <aurabindo:matrix.org> Any idea how to fix this error?
[20:01:24] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @aura I try to reproduce the error by syncing Spacemacs just now, but there is no issue here. I guess you might have an error in your dotfile. Try starting Spacemacs using `emacs --debug-init`. If that does not provide a clue then try to rename your dotfile (i.e. backup and delete it) and restart Spacemacs. If that does not fix things then let us know here...
[20:02:08] <FromGitter> <aurabindo:matrix.org> Thanks for the response Daniel. I'll give that a shot
[20:02:22] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Good luck
[20:14:57] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> there was a report for this
[20:15:13] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/15360
[20:15:55] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @lebensterben  When you startup Spacemacs, do you see the full contents of the home buffer?
[20:16:05] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> but one of the commenter seems to be reporting about spacemacs buffer
[20:18:04] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I have only a 1600 x 900 screen resolution, and on the default welcome screen I don't see the `Proudly free software` nor the time spent on loading packages
[20:18:46] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I would prefer we see/show all the contents on a default (fresh) install
[20:18:56] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @lebensterben
[20:22:20] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> So I would propose to either reduce the size of the logo, or reduce the default number of shown recent files and project (or otherwise make it screen resolution dependent)...
[20:39:11] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> they are in the end of the home buffer now
[20:39:38] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Yes I know, but I think they should be presented to users on first use
[20:39:52] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I mean on screen
[20:40:27] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Users can set `dotspacemacs-startup-lists` later
[20:42:08] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> but on first use the starup lists should be empty
[20:42:30] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Ah... yeah that's a good point
[20:42:33] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> because there is no recent file or recent projects
[20:42:47] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Okay... so probably it's okay on most screens then
[20:43:02] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> üëç
[20:43:10] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> the thing that takes up too much space is our logo
[20:43:24] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> True... but I like the size
[20:44:18] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> However, I think it should be easy to make it scalable if you think that is preferable
[20:45:10] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> ideally it should be scalable
[20:45:22] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Okay... I will have a look then
[20:47:47] <FromGitter> <davidpiano> @aurabindo:matrix.org may have the same problem I have, https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/15360#issuecomment-1045462804
[20:49:24] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> @davidpiano if you move the cursor to the logo, you can use - and + to change its size actually
[20:50:16] <FromGitter> <davidpiano> Wasn't me with logo problem. I have logo set to nil.
[20:50:19] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> so we just need to set `:scale` of an image to change its size
[20:51:00] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> but scalable logo is of very low priority now..
[21:01:58] <FromGitter> <aurabindo:matrix.org> Thanks David! I must have been running into the same issue!
[21:20:31] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> > ideally it should be scalable ‚èé  ‚èé @lebensterben  I have created a PR, but no hurries (although it is very short and simple)
