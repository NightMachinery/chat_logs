[02:54:49] <superz> much drama in that thread
[02:58:24] <kuudes> hmm. it seems now possibly that if current things continue, about 1/4 of population here in Oulu would get infected, most of them within the following 8 weeks. also about 8% of vaccinated people would get infected. very few people would die or go to hospital, however
[02:58:40] <kuudes> 2 dose vaccinated
[02:58:48] <kuudes> of 1 dose vaccinated, slightly larger fraction
[02:59:27] <kuudes> also in its hayday, more than half of the people who fall ill have at least 1 dose of vaccine on them
[03:00:00] <kuudes> I guess if I would manage to fully isolate on the peak week, that would cut the chances to contract it to half?
[03:00:24] <kuudes> I don't know if it is worthwhile
[03:01:40] <kuudes> I guess it would be a sanish course of action to minimize human contacts but allow family to go work while masked and 2 dosed, and allow kids to go to daycare and school and their closest friends, but keep 1 week of complete isolation when the daily observed cases rise above 1/1000 of local population?
[03:02:23] <kuudes> that could maybe take it to around 4% of getting ill total, less for hospitalization or death

[03:25:46] <Robomot> Mythic Mode - LessWrong 2.0 viewer (Follow-up to: The Intelligent Social Web Related to: Fake Frameworks Yesterday I described a framework for viewing culture as a kind of distributed intelligence, and ourselves as nodes in this distributed network. Today I’d like to share a way of using this framework intentionally that doesn’t require Looking. …)
[03:27:25] <quanticle> Fake Frameworks and Mythic Mode are the literal opposite of the empirical evidence-driven mindset that Eliezer advocates; it's not surprising that he'd be mad that people are associating that shit with his version of rationality
[03:27:30] <saturn2> adiabatic: CBT is when you learn to recognize harmful thought patterns and replace them with more normal ones, reverse CBT is doing the opposite of that

[03:37:32] <two2thehead> what's the tl;dr for kids as a vector for spread onto adults?
[03:38:10] <two2thehead> because my prior is that the second person to get infected by influenza in a home, is more likely to die from it compared to the first

[03:46:00] <vrs> where's the infohazard
[03:46:21] <two2thehead> "As an old Chinese saying goes, “got married with a woman will make a man forget his mother”. It describes a situation that after a man establishing an intimate relationship, his psychological support and emotional input for his mother will be shifted to some extent to his lover. This research aims to explore the effects of love states and gender difference on the gaze of his lover or mother under the condition of pain. In this study,
[03:46:21] <two2thehead>  35 college students were recruited, and 34 valid data (21 females, 13 males) were finally collected. Participants were divided into non-love group and in-love group by filling up the Passionate Love Scale (PLS). The length of tolerance under the cold pressor test and corresponding eye movement data are recorded. The results show that mother and intimate others’ picture can act as sources of social support which is helpful for pain relief
[03:46:22] <two2thehead> . Non-love female participants significantly spent more time watching mothers’ pictures compared to lovers’ picture under the condition of pain. This distinction became smaller among in-love female participants. However, no statistical difference in the duration of mothers’ and lovers’ picture was found. In-love male participants significantly spend more time watching lovers’ pictures compared to their mothers under pain. T
[03:46:22] <adiabatic> delusion
[03:46:27] <two2thehead> he result suggests that love state affects the duration of mothers’ and lovers’ pictures among females. There is also gender difference in social support seeking."

[04:01:27] <rmmh> Or was it the people in an intense relationship vs a casual one 
[04:02:32] <nshepperd> i think it's that
[04:03:48] <two2thehead> I withdraw my above statement
[04:03:53] <two2thehead> nshepperd is right
[04:03:55] <nshepperd> they scored whether participants loved their partners or not, sand divided up the results by that
[04:03:58] <two2thehead> I'm reading it now
[04:04:06] <gwern> shawwwn: by antithetic sampling I mean a variance reduction trick. like if you implemented minibatches of reals by doing sampling-without-replacement of exactly 1 image from each of the 1000 imagenet classes for a minibatch of n=1000. this would be perfectly balanced, as opposed to occasionally getting a minibatch of like 600 dogs or something. for the fakes, one trick would be to generate...
[04:04:12] <gwern> ...half of the _z_s from N(0,1), and then *negate* them. by construction each pair will have exactly mean 0, as any outlier in one direction gets an outlier in the other direction. such tricks are widely used in monte carlo and experimental design because by shrinking the variance, you can typically save a ton of _n_. and for GANs, given how fragile they are, it may result in better results...
[04:04:18] <gwern> ...in addition to faster results
[04:04:25] <nshepperd> it is unclear from the abstract whether the pictures were shown simultaneously or in separate tests
[04:05:47] <two2thehead> males or females in relationships, split into love_high or love_low categories, equalized by sex, compared to images of their mother
[04:06:30] <two2thehead> and yes, they had a control group
[04:06:59] <two2thehead> both their significant other and their mothers were statistically higher in providing comfort compared to the neutral image
[04:08:45] <vrs> saturn2: huh so the infohazard is, if you're trans and set up your personality in "hemispheres", then the male- and female-coded self concepts align themselves with each hemisphere and that cases conflict?
[04:09:01] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : TIL "Children develop a sense of their own national identities, and knowledge of and attitudes towards other nations, around five to seven years old..."

[04:10:39] <nshepperd> i suppose for maximum variance reduction in a gan you could first learn n z's distributed equally over the latent hypersphere, then sample your zs by applying a random orthonormal transformation
[04:12:41] <nshepperd> in other words a rotation
[04:12:56] <gwern> nshepperd: there's probably some way to... yeah, sample equidistant points, and then 'rotate' them each minibatch
[04:14:20] <gwern> if you shift or rotate, you presumably can cover every possible point, while never repeating, and while each minibatch has exactly N(0,1) over every dimension

[04:17:45] <RiversHaveWings> to sharpen up blurry CogView outputs

[04:34:43] <nshepperd> my idea was to just modify the image at each step to set the scaled down image equal to the input. or add an l2 loss between downscale(image) and input. either should be doable without ruining the noise

[04:39:11] <Obormot\Arcturus>  interpretation (my publishers handle this, not me) is that in a smaller market, people are much more flexible --- is this good? Trying to go beyond, things get more complicated and the sort of personal connections one can rely upon to overcome doubts are replaced by a sort of clueless 'I don't know how this works, let's avoid controversy.'"
[04:40:49] <gwern> I think smaller markets are less likely to have a professional activist caste or enable the sort of within-org competition that motivates much of this stuff

[05:38:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like... and this is actually more obvious / difficult to ignore in Invincible than in some other settings... there are many superheroes who can essentially generate vast amounts of energy out of nothing, AND can apply it in all sorts of *unbelievably* convenient ways
[05:38:42] <adiabatic> Well, depends on the superhero. Say you're Gambit, the guy who makes cards (and anything else) explode. How does that have non-combat applications?
[05:38:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> This fact should transform the global economy pretty much immediately
[05:39:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Military applications, power generation, mining / demolition ... come on :p
[05:39:41] <adiabatic> yeah, it's real obvious that their world would be super warped by the supers and…yet…the only difference between them and us is we had the 'rona and they didn't
[05:39:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> By "military" I don't even mean "combat", note
[05:39:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah
[05:40:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Atom Eve *by herself* is clearly capable of upending entire industries overnight
[05:40:36] <adiabatic> but then again, you'd think any universe with superheroes is going to be much less pro-city because so much shit happens in NYC when Spider-Man and his enemies are around
[05:40:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, sure
[05:40:49] <adiabatic> you'd think more people would say "fuck it" and move out à la COVID

[05:45:59] <quanticle> I was just about to say, after reading the linked article
[05:46:05] <quanticle> The horse seems like it deserved it
[05:46:29] <gwern> adiabatic: yeah, they need some variance reduction, like how in bridge, everyone plays the same decks

[05:54:43] <adiabatic> oh wow
[05:54:51] <quanticle> Shoot a guard, run away, swim across a river, swordfight, grab a random horse, and run away
[05:54:51] <adiabatic> this is even cooler than "ski a little, shoot a little"

[05:56:02] <adiabatic> oh, laser pistol. boo.
[05:56:09] <quanticle> It used to be real guns
[05:56:12] <quanticle> Then they made it air guns
[05:56:17] <quanticle> And now it's laser pistols
[05:56:57] <quanticle> gwern: I agree! When you're escaping from the Huns, you can't count on finding an agreeable horse!
[05:57:57] <gwern> quanticle: exactly. providing some with agreeable horses is just downright unfair. they should be recruiting from rodeos. the olympics should be using only grade-A horses - 'a' for 'asshole'
[05:58:21] <saturn2> why can't horse boxing be a legitimate sport
[05:59:22] <gwern> 'As the events of the ancient pentathlon were modeled after the skills of the ideal soldier to defend a fortification of that time, Coubertin created the contest to simulate the experience of a 19th-century cavalry soldier behind enemy lines: he must ride an unfamiliar horse, fight enemies with pistol and sword, swim, and run to return to his own soldiers.[2] In the 1912 Games as only...
[05:59:28] <gwern> ...officers competed, the competitors were permitted to use their own horses. Up to the 1952 Olympics the ordinary cavalry soldier was considered a professional athlete, as he was riding and training horses for a living, while the officer was the amateur.' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_pentathlon#History strange distinction
[05:59:29] <Robomot> Modern pentathlon - Wikipedia [History] (The modern pentathlon is an Olympic sport that comprises five different events; fencing (one-touch épée), freestyle swimming (200 m), equestrian show jumping (15 jumps), and a final combined event of pistol shooting and cross country running (3200 m). …)
[06:00:12] <gwern> 'This segment has received criticism for being perceived as being a lottery should an athlete draw an un-cooperative horse;[8] others argue that most incidence of horses refusing to jump are result of poor rider ability on the part of the athlete and adopting behaviour which unsettles the horse.'

[06:16:36] <vrs> quanticle: probably not harder to snap out of it than the first time, which probably comes somewhere in young adulthood for most rationalists
[06:17:16] <vrs> also man I just read ziz's "net negative" post and it's kinda sad
[06:17:42] <vrs> smart kid meets their heroes, gets told they probably can't contribute to the cause, breaks
[06:18:08] <gwern> who, ziz? they sure do seem to've been net negative, yeah
[06:18:59] <quanticle> rmmh: That was neat
[06:20:27] <vrs> cyclogyro is the same principle as a darrieus rotor, no?
[06:20:54] <quanticle> It's cool, but... I can't help but have an intuition that there's massive amounts of drag when that thing tries to move forwards
[06:22:26] <vrs> around the wingtips most definitely
[06:24:09] <vrs> you could use a caternary like in a darrieus, and then hmm idk I'm not a plane engineer
[06:24:28] <quanticle> But also on the wings that are on the up/downswing when the entire vehicle is moving forward. You're basically pushing a flat board through the air 
[06:25:08] <vrs> presumably you either make the blades thin, then you need to spin real fast to generate any thrust, or you make them thick, then you can't go very fast
[06:30:07] <nshepperd> quanticle: it sounds like what you do there is rotate the wings so that they're parallel to the relative motion of the air in that phase
[06:34:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> You know, the more I think about Invincible and how they fail to really take seriously any of the shit they kinda gesture at, the more absurd it is
[06:34:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like... Atom Eve can literally cause entire swaths of farmland to grow fully mature crop yields instantaneously with a wave of her hand.
[06:35:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is explicitly shown in the series and there's no indication that this has any cost other than "doing this sort of shit for a whole day makes her kinda tired"
[06:35:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> How is this not immediately world-changing??
[06:36:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> How is she having the insight of "I can use my powers for something other than punching criminals in the face" for the first time after three years of superheroing, with no one else, apparently, having thought of this before
[06:36:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's one of those things where this one crack in genre conventions just blows the whole thing wide open
[06:37:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> You just can't keep suspending disbelief after the series makes a plot point of this
[06:38:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> That one guy can *teleport* with perfect accuracy, even bringing along someone for the ride, and he's ... henchman to some urban crime lord?? How
[06:38:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> You get this shit in like Justice League Unlimited or something, and, fine, genre conventions, but man, this show makes a point of subverting them
[06:38:53] <nshepperd> billionaires would pay so much money to be teleported across the world instead of having to take a jet
[06:38:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indeed
[06:43:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh yeah and these other two guys have perfected human (and near-human) cloning and memory transfer, such that they can just make copies of anyone, and they're ... I have no idea what the hell their thing even is, they seem to just be supervillaining for lols, and spending much of their time in gov't lockup
[06:44:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> It makes zero sense that they aren't kajillionaires
[06:44:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or working for kajillionaires
[06:44:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or anything really
[06:46:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> The series also has another problem, which is like ... ok, so Omni-man is Superman, right. Well, but Superman has a weakness (kryptonite) and multiple people who are not only aware of that weakness but also totally prepared to use it against him, if shenanigans ensue (Batman, CADMUS, etc.)
[06:46:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Omni-man has no known weaknesses and no one can stop him
[06:47:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which is not itself a problem! In fact, it's an interesting (and terrifying) twist on the Superman archetype
[06:48:17] <gwern> (if perhaps a bit of a retread of doctor manhattan?)
[06:48:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> (sure)
[06:48:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> The problem starts when you ask "Ok, but *why* are Viltrumites like this? They're all this ridiculously powerful and indestructible? (But inexplicably still indistinguishable from humans to the point of being inter-fertile with humans?) Because...?"
[06:50:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> To be fair, this is only a particularly egregious case of the power comparison issue in the superhero comic genre
[06:51:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because Superman-type powers make no sense to begin with (just on a basic macro-scale physics level, never mind anything else), there isn't any meaningful point of reference for comparisons of power or combat ability between any two entities
[06:51:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's all just pseudo-narrative nonsense
[06:55:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> But if the power scale isn't grounded in anything but pseudo-narrative nonsense, then it's fair game for questions like "An entire planet of people each of whom cannot be harmed by any of the parade of ridiculously powerful entities that are running around Earth? For what reason? They just randomly happened to evolve that way?"
[06:55:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> It doesn't work
[06:56:12] <adiabatic> For some of this shit you need to just turn your brain off; I'm reminded how some of the consistently darkest peoples in the Avatar universe's planet live at the poles
[06:56:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> You can of course construct explanatory scenarios, but (a) the series does not actually do this, and (b) there's every chance that such scenarios break the characterization and stuff that we're given
[06:56:34] <adiabatic> it took me a month or two to figure "damn, those seal-penguins must have a LOT of vitamin D in them"
[06:56:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Yeah, that's my point, though: "just turn your brain off" works fine for e.g. JLU. But Invincible *makes a point of calling this stuff to your attention*!
[06:57:05] <adiabatic> also you'd figure the neighbors would notice the sonic booms and shit around the house
[06:57:19] <gwern> ah, lampshading
[06:57:34] <gwern> adiabatic: I mean, don't they? it's not like you're getting much sunlight in the arctic swaddled up in your furs
[06:58:24] <adiabatic> gwern: right. Thing is, I had to "parsecs tell you how badass it is because you can cut closer to something dangerous" retcon that star wars fans do
[06:58:54] <adiabatic> my hunch is that making a fully accurate (or at least follows all the implications) superhero comic is going to be about as hard as, say, Dichronauts worldbuilding (although maybe with less math)
[06:59:31] <gwern> adiabatic: the difference is the Maw is awesome and so it was a happy mistake
[06:59:52] <gwern> I love the idea of the millennium falcon being so fast it's skimming the edges of a black hole cluster to beat imperial customs
[07:00:40] <adiabatic> oh, there's a name for the thing?
[07:01:08] <gwern> and it's a good one too
[07:01:22] <adiabatic> Good track on the Halo soundtrack disc.
[07:01:40] <gwern> I castigate KJA for his horrifyingly bad Dune work, but his early star wars EU stuff was good solid pulp SF
[07:02:02] <adiabatic> is that the new dune movie or the old dune movie or old dune books
[07:02:21] <gwern> the new dune books never really stopped :(
[07:03:13] <adiabatic> …oh
[07:03:19] <gwern> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_prequel_series#The_Caladan_Trilogy uuuuuggghhhhh
[07:03:20] <Robomot> Dune prequel series - Wikipedia [The Caladan Trilogy] (The Dune prequel series is a sequence of novel trilogies written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. Set in the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert, the novels take place in various time periods before and in between Herbert's original six novels, which began with 1965's Dune. …)
[07:03:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> (For example: one explanation for the Viltrumites: they perfected nanotech and replaced the cells of their bodies with NANOMACHINES, SON! [cf. _Neptune's Brood_ but way more indestructible and capable], which make them both not hurtable in any reasonable way and also able to store and generate vast quantities of energy via, uh, hyperspace taps, who knows)
[07:03:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But then the whole "cull the weak" story completely stops making sense, because when you can do that kind of engineering, the notion of anyone being "weak" is laughable)
[07:04:10] <gwern> let's see, they took a 4 year break... I wonder if they deliberately timed it for villeneue?
[07:04:26] <adiabatic> I can guarantee you I'd use my nanomachines way less well than a bunch of people I know if we all got them
[07:04:36] <gwern> that's exactly the sort of money-hungry shit brian herbert *would* do so that's probably it
[07:04:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Your brain would also be nanomachines and thus you'd get "whoa, I know nanomachine-fu" as a DLC
[07:05:13] <adiabatic> being able to use what you've been given is…not guaranteed to be the same across all people
[07:05:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> No my point is that "being able to use" is also part of "what you've been given", at that level of tech
[07:06:19] <adiabatic> if they can't nanomachines their brains into mental uniformity there'll be a bell curve of effectiveness
[07:06:50] <gwern> I mean, at that level... why can't they? just literally copy the best brain
[07:07:22] <adiabatic> the cloning subplot is handled by the twins, gwern
[07:08:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Yeah but if the baseline is high enough, there's still no sense in going "it's so important to cull the weak that we massacre half the planet doing so"
[07:08:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's just a farce
[07:08:38] <adiabatic> although now that I think about it agian, if both of them mostly know what the other is thinking, all the "…clone" digs seem even more performative than what would happen IRL
[07:09:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Furthermore! Here's my question. So the whole concept of "cull the weak" - it can't be due to resource limitations, right? It's not that there's not enough resources to support 2N people but enough to support N. No, their tech level is way, way past post-scarcity.
[07:10:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, it's clearly a Eugenics Through Violence™ type thing
[07:10:10] <adiabatic> you'd think there'd be splintering of "fuck this, I'm outtie" and a massive diaspora, not…infighting
[07:10:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Where they don't want weak genes to be carried forth to the next generation
[07:10:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which, fine, let's roll with that. But then:
[07:10:23] <adiabatic> lololol just hold your breath and fly away dude
[07:10:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why the hell are they not ... being fruitful and multiplying
[07:10:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> "oh we're stretched thin across our conquered worlds" - bullshit! have more babies!
[07:11:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Y'all fuckers just went to all the trouble of making sure only the strong survived, and then ... you had an underpopulation problem??
[07:11:29] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: do you have any idea how much afterschool nano-combat tutoring costs?!
[07:11:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol
[07:12:13] <gwern> look, it takes 118 years to save up for a proper nanocollege tuition, only a deeply irresponsible Viltrumite mother would just... pop out babies or whatever it is you think they should do
[07:12:42] <adiabatic> gwern: _Idiocracy_, but for Viltrum
[07:14:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like ... dude spent a solid two decades "weakening" Earth so they could conquer it easier
[07:14:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Instead
[07:14:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> He could have had a half-dozen kids
[07:14:56] <gwern> he just wasn't brought up that way. and what would the other Viltrumites think if he had a bunch of bastards?
[07:14:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then come to Earth with said kids, now fully grown (and trained! and loyalty-propaganda'd! and, you know, just naturally loyal to their homeworld and society!), and totally flattened all opposition

[07:49:36] <adiabatty> actually tell me more about sheet cheesecake
[07:49:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatty: It's pretty much, you boil rice with milk. Add a bit of sugar, not too much. Raisins, also fine. That's it?
[07:49:45] <adiabatty> is it interesting or just shaped differently
[07:49:58] <adiabatty> doesn't boiled milk give you the runs or something
[07:50:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> nnno...
[07:50:43] <adiabatty> what if you boil it in a microwave
[07:50:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Dunno who told you that... anyway, I dunno about any "sheet cheesecake", but I just used it as a sheet cake pan with a conveniently removable bottom
[07:50:45] <adiabatty> what can go wrong

[07:50:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Never owned a microwave, so can't say
[07:53:16] <saturn2> i don't think you'll have good results with boiling milk in a microwave
[07:54:04] <gwern> microwaves scald milk too easily. and you also get the fun of superheated liquids
[07:55:09] <adiabatic> what happens if you scald milk, then
[07:55:17] <adiabatic> does THAT give you the runs?
[07:55:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Understand that when I say you "boil" the rice with milk, I do mean "simmer", like cooking rice normally, but ... milk
[07:56:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Actually this technique that Serious Eats gives for rice pudding should work fine for porridge too: cook rice in 2 parts water first, then simmer it in 4 parts milk

[07:56:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> I've never even used a rice cooker
[07:56:53] <adiabatic> and the rice cooker might be, like, something I've only done a few times
[07:57:20] <adiabatic> as it stands, I have a year-old bag of basmati rice that I really _should_ do something with…
[07:57:29] <saturn2> putting milk in a rice cooker might work
[07:57:41] <adiabatic> I'm leery of putting milk in a rice cooker
[07:57:51] <adiabatic> I'd sooner use my enameled cast iron
[07:58:42] <adiabatic> or hell, a medium saucepan if I want to try out smaller sizes
[07:58:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Well, why not make some mujaddara, it is delicious and I have a recipe for it that I have now tested several times
[07:59:03] <adiabatic> is it going to shut down my qat operation
[07:59:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> No idea what that is
[07:59:31] <adiabatic> [misreading it as "mujahideen", the anti-drug brigade of Afghanistan]
[07:59:37] <adiabatic> lay it on me

[08:01:38] <adiabatic> hmm, lentils too
[08:02:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[08:02:27] <adiabatic> I _probably_ have all these spices, but it seems like I can fudge it at the edges and I'll still be OK
[08:02:46] <adiabatic> like, dump in pre-mixed pumpkin spice and it'll probably be OK
[08:03:09] <adiabatic> What if you rinse the rice a little bit
[08:03:35] <adiabatic> normally I'm a rinse-until-clear guy
[08:04:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, the spices are whatever
[08:04:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you want to change the spice mix, nobody's gonna stop you
[08:04:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not like a it's a baked good and the chemistry will be all wrong if you tweak a variable
[08:04:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Definitely do not rinse the rice though
[08:04:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> 100% do not
[08:05:12] <adiabatic> At all? Fish through the rice for odd grains, but it goes straight from the bag to the pot?
[08:05:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> At all.

[08:33:31] <nshepperd2> i just did what seemed obviously correct
[08:37:23] <dbohdan> gwern: The _Blame!_ movie is pretty good (at least from my perspective as a fan of the manga).  It reflects the technology they made it with in an interesting way: the organic aspect of _Blame!_'s creatures is toned down.  For example, when Killy finds Cibo, she is a metal Terminator half-skeleton rather than a human-looking one with wires.  They also compactify the story in space and time.  Conceptually, reducing _Blame!_'s scale seems like blasphemy, 
[08:37:23] <dbohdan> but the movie's setting works.
[08:41:28] <gwern> what, *reducing* the biology? but that's where all the body horror and esthetic comes from

[09:39:48] <pompolic> man
[09:39:52] <pompolic> i apologize in advance
[09:40:09] <pompolic> but there was some postrat discourse i want to necro
[09:41:27] <pompolic> i don't really like being called a postrat but it keeps happening -- i don't like the implications of "post"
[09:41:59] <pompolic> i am also a fan of sarah's blogs and meaningness and a bunch of the people in that cluster, but not all
[09:42:30] <pompolic> anyway, all that said: the parts about "mythic mode" seem spot on
[09:42:36] <pompolic> when it comes to ritualposting
[09:43:37] <adiabatic> I like talking about postrats
[09:43:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> What specifically seems spot on
[09:43:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> And what the heck is "ritualposting"
[09:43:44] <adiabatic> they're not all insane all the time
[09:43:51] <pompolic> sorry, I'll slow down
[09:43:57] <pompolic> sarah posts about rituals sometimes
[09:44:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ah, yes
[09:44:10] <pompolic> and someone above related this to the LW post about mythic mode
[09:44:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Probably her weakest posts
[09:44:19] <pompolic> well
[09:44:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Regardless
[09:44:25] <pompolic> there is a referent, i guess
[09:44:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Honestly I have no idea what you're saying
[09:44:46] <adiabatic> is/are the posts about basically reinventing the Sabbath postrat discourse or no or kinda
[09:44:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> You agree with the Mythic Mode post? You disagree with it?
[09:44:52] <pompolic> i agree!
[09:44:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok
[09:44:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> And the connection to rituals is what?
[09:45:45] <pompolic> the sarah post i'm half-remembering talks about experiencing extraordinary mental states via rituals
[09:46:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, people do that sometimes
[09:46:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> What of it
[09:46:32] <pompolic> i may have to re-read the mythic mode post, but my cached version is "sometimes people talk about seeing gods and demons, and they are in this epistemic mode when they do that"
[09:46:53] <Obormot\Gaia> Yes, that's true
[09:47:13] <pompolic> what i found interesting is that i spent the last decade or so basically holding onto rationalism to drag myself _out_ of it
[09:47:26] <Obormot\Gaia> "This epistemic mode" being "suspending your logical faculties and just believing any old crap"
[09:47:42] <ggreer> scrolling through Facebook for the first time in forever: family photos, family photos, then… https://i.imgur.com/KCA5E2A.jpg O_o
[09:47:51] <pompolic> i retain access to it and i think that makes me look like a postrat when i don't bother to communicate with shared references
[09:48:03] <Obormot\Gaia> ggreer: That is a shitty flag
[09:48:16] <Obormot\Gaia> At the very least it needs those weird spikes on the diagonal cross removed
[09:48:57] <ggreer> Yeah also anissimov really has gone down a rabbit hole since I friended him in 2008
[09:48:58] <nshepperd2> they make it look like it's meant to be an optical illusion
[09:49:10] <Obormot\Gaia> pompolic: I think quanticle's essay is a sufficient response to the whole "mythic mode" thing
[09:49:24] <adiabatic> nice colors but I think it has too many fine details
[09:49:42] <adiabatic> the bars are bullshit and the leaves are…fidgety
[09:49:47] <Obormot\Gaia> Agreed
[09:50:20] <nshepperd2> i think it looks dynamic
[09:50:35] <nshepperd2> you can feel the hungry serrated edges biting into your flesh
[09:50:48] <pompolic> it kind of is
[09:51:30] <Obormot\Gaia> pompolic: More generally, pretty much every kind of weird shit that "postrats" get into and start evangelizing is subject to my "show me the cake" response; and in my experience, there is no cake (and when you ask to be shown it, you invariably get clouds of squid ink in response)
[09:51:43] <Obormot\Gaia> And as we all know, you can't make a cake out of squid ink.
[09:52:15] <Obormot\Gaia> Nor are cephalopods of any kind, or the secretions thereof, the same thing as a cake.
[09:52:16] <pompolic> well, what i can give you is a recipe for trolling
[09:52:36] <saturn2> flags should have more fine details imo. why stick with the limitations of the middle ages
[09:52:38] <Obormot\Gaia> pompolic: You know the comment I am talking about, yes?
[09:52:50] <pompolic> i'm not certain
[09:52:55] <Obormot\Gaia> saturn2: They should have fewer details, they should be iconic and recognizable
[09:53:05] <Obormot\Gaia> saturn2: That is why the best flag is the flag of Magnitogorsk.
[09:53:06] <saturn2> make a flag with unreal engine photorealistic renderings

[09:53:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now that is a goddamn flag.
[09:53:57] <nshepperd2> (seems to just be a pointlessly expensive way to add color though)
[09:54:47] <saturn2> Magnitogorsk doesn't seem very futuristic or accelerationist
[09:55:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd: Fondant!!
[09:55:04] * Obormot\Arcturus hiss
[09:55:07] <pompolic> but i'm not trying to evangelize for postrats here anyway
[09:55:25] <pompolic> i'm not saying mythic mode is good or valuable or anything
[09:55:26] <nshepperd2> Obormot\Arcturus: i agree
[09:55:38] <nshepperd2> cupcakes aren't real cakes either
[09:55:40] <pompolic> but what i did want to say is that it can be trivially parsed
[09:56:01] <adiabatic> saturn2: giant boobs: they look nice but I wouldn't want to have to carry them around all day. too-fine flag details: they're nice to look at but I wouldn't want to have to sew it myself
[09:56:02] <pompolic> by applying miller's law
[09:56:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: I mean, sure, it's just another iteration of "but what if instead of believing true things, we believed false things???"
[09:56:45] <saturn2> adiabatic: that's the idea, it would be impossible to sew without robots
[09:56:47] <pompolic> do you believe literally everything you imagine
[09:57:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you're just imagining it and not believing it, that's not "mythic mode", it's just daydreaming
[09:57:30] <pompolic> miller's law asks you to "imagine what it could be true of"
[09:57:56] <pompolic> i've found that people are exceedingly honest about their inner daydream landscape when they talk about spirits and shit
[09:58:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't see how Miller's Law applies
[09:58:42] <pompolic> hm
[09:59:12] <pompolic> i will probably have to think on this a few years before i can make a coherent post
[09:59:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Miller's Law was formulated by Mike Beltzner and is named in respect of Dave Miller, long-standing owner of the Bugzilla product:
[09:59:20] <Obormot\Arcturus>     All discussions of incremental updates to Bugzilla will eventually trend towards proposals for large scale redesigns or feature additions or replacements for Bugzilla."
[09:59:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, he's not *wrong* ...
[09:59:29] <pompolic> huh
[09:59:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> (yes I know that's not the Miller's law you meant :p )
[09:59:51] <pompolic> oh okay
[10:00:00] <rmmh> This snack has been widely sold on the streets for decades—from the city of Haridwar in the north to Pune in the west and in several places in the south—and yet, somehow, no one seems to know what it is.
[10:00:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%27s_law#In_communication
[10:00:23] <Robomot> Miller's law - Wikipedia [In communication] (Miller's law can refer to three different principles. …)
[10:00:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> And, like, ok, that's fair, but on the other hand, what happens if you apply Miller's law, but the person was lying and/or bullshitting?
[10:01:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then you've Miller's law'd yourself into imagining all sorts of nonsense, while also simultaneously totally failing at this task of communication
[10:01:49] <pompolic> well, i don't think anything mythic mode can be a *lie*, because it doesn't refer to the territory
[10:01:58] <pompolic> not sure about bullshit
[10:02:02] <pompolic> you could say it's all bullshit
[10:02:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, not a lie, it definitely falls into the bullshit category
[10:02:21] <pompolic> but it's like, people serialize their maps into conversation directly!
[10:02:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> As for not referring to the territory, well, if it *doesn't* refer to the territory then it's not anything at all, is it?
[10:02:39] <pompolic> and this gives a clue about their mental blind spots i suppose
[10:03:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> It has to either refer to the territory or be devoid of content
[10:03:18] <saturn2> why couldn't we just talk about this stuff without using a "fake framework"
[10:03:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indeed
[10:03:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And thus, with everything)
[10:04:34] <saturn2> pompolic: did you mean you've been trying for a decade to drag yourself out of mythic mode?
[10:04:41] <pompolic> yes!
[10:04:48] <pompolic> i was raised by insane people
[10:04:48] <saturn2> wow
[10:04:58] <saturn2> my condolences
[10:05:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> You see it's this kind of shit that makes me think that imposing atheist materialism by force was a good idea
[10:05:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe we didn't get it quite right the first time but shouldn't we try again? If the alternative is... this?
[10:05:59] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: how is our ruling class not atheist materialists, though
[10:06:10] <adiabatic> or is the problem the lack of force
[10:06:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Our ruling class are dualists to the max

[10:08:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> pompolic: btw this is the comment I referred to earlier https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/tMhEv28KJYWsu6Wdo/kensh/comment/hYiyo8JbgXtT5wcZx
[10:08:16] <Robomot> Said Achmiz comments on Kenshō - LessWrong 2.0 viewer (I want to address this response, because it fits a pattern I’ve seen a few times, which I think is an important aspect of this discussion. Here’s the pattern: “I’ve invented a fascinating new baking technique! With it, I have baked an amazing new cake!” “An amazing new cake?! Sounds delicious! Could we have a taste?” …)
[10:08:23] <pompolic> thanks
[10:08:51] <adiabatic> I figure that there can be some benefit to 
[10:09:17] <pompolic> i believe you misread me as extolling the virtues of mythic mode
[10:09:30] <pompolic> while i was trying and perhaps failing to say that it ain't shit
[10:09:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Alright
[10:10:06] <adiabatic> …meditating that are noticeable, but it would take some sort of +5σ response-to-meditation to make differences in outward behavior (not getting as pissed off, say) noticeable to someone like Obormot\Arcturus
[10:10:42] <adiabatic> whereas the usual response is something like 10% less likely to get overheated in an argument or something like that
[10:10:44] <pompolic> but i think it's attractive because you can in fact have weird experiences under stress, trance states, psychedelics
[10:12:04] <pompolic> which naive materialism may not provide satisfying answers for. i think better understanding of human sensory processing however would allow such explanation
[10:13:44] <pompolic> i will post you a cake when i finished reverse engineering my sensory stack
[10:14:15] <saturn2> just cause you feel it doesn't mean it's there
[10:14:25] <pompolic> yes
[10:14:29] <pompolic> i could be wrong
[10:16:15] <pompolic> to find out, i need a falsifiable hypothesis
[10:16:20] <pompolic> i am working on that
[10:16:20] <adiabatic> I haven't read this again just now but my very hazy recollections make it sound like this is proto-postrationality: http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/dancing.html
[10:16:22] <Robomot> Dancing With The Gods (Portrait of the Author as a Young Mystic)
[10:16:30] <pompolic> i think so as well
[10:16:56] <pompolic> imho ESR is also talking about how to translate between mythic mode and like....normal people speak
[10:17:03] <Obormot\Gaia> adiabatic: In fact people who've achieved enlightenment or w/e seem to be consistently *more* likely than average to get pissed off and generally behave like dicks
[10:17:33] <adiabatic> Obormot\Gaia: Maybe the 10%-happier crowd is better off than people who go all the way to full enlightenment
[10:17:44] <PlanckWalk> Pushing your explanation-finding meat out of whack sure is a great way to end up with things you can't explain.
[10:17:46] <Obormot\Gaia> Maybe the 10%-happier crowd doesn't exist
[10:18:20] <adiabatic> like, I think it's quite likely that meditation techniques are useful, but getting to enlightenment is almost certainly a bad idea (ignoring the  time burnt on trying to get there)
[10:18:36] <adiabatic> I'm pretty sure I'm in the 1–5%-happier crowd
[10:18:58] <Obormot\Gaia> PlanckWalk: Yes - to quote that brilliantly pithy SSC comment: "Step 1: Crack lens telescope. Step 2: Announce discovery of jagged lines in the heavens."
[10:19:09] <Obormot\Gaia> *lens of
[10:19:20] <PlanckWalk> That is indeed a great summary.
[10:19:30] <pompolic> mine started out of whack and i applied extraordinary effort until it wasn't \o/
[10:19:42] <pompolic> well, it was less out of whack
[10:19:45] <pompolic> the flesh is weak
[10:20:02] <Obormot\Gaia> pompolic: Really one of the weirdest claims in discussions like this is the claim that naive materialism may not provide satisfying answers for weird experiences like that
[10:20:11] <PlanckWalk> Well yes.  There is a reason why this is "less wrong" and not "totally right"
[10:20:19] <pompolic> naive materialism just says "that didn't happen"
[10:20:24] <Obormot\Gaia> No it doesn't
[10:20:40] <Obormot\Gaia> It says "yes, you had that experience, because your brain was fucked up on drugs"
[10:20:53] <pompolic> okay that's fair
[10:21:04] <pompolic> but i do think that "was fucked up" is placing it beyond inquiry
[10:21:10] <pompolic> it's not a gears-level model
[10:21:21] <Obormot\Gaia> Well yeah obviously the full explanation is more specific than that
[10:21:41] <Obormot\Gaia> And explains precisely how it was fucked up, what chemicals doing what, what brain functionality altered how, etc.
[10:21:58] <Obormot\Gaia> Like, "naive materialism" is *singularly well-positioned* to provide satisfying answers to stuff like this, in a way that any other paradigm cannot
[10:22:29] <Obormot\Gaia> It's pretty much the best possible way to approach questions like this if you want satisfying answers, which is why it absolutely perplexes me to see people claim the opposite
[10:23:17] <pompolic> ok, let me back up a bit: when i say "naive materialism", i didn't mean to imply that it needs some super special extension
[10:23:26] <pompolic> materialism can explain it perfectly fine
[10:23:50] <Obormot\Gaia> If you have a weird experience, you could (a) go to some manner of mysticism to explain it, which *even if, hypothetically, it was true*, would not be a satisfying answer, because it would be mystical and mysterian, and you wouldn't be able to use it to predict anything and you'd still be confused (because that's what mystical/mysterian frameworks are like)
[10:24:12] <pompolic> +1
[10:24:26] <Obormot\Gaia> ... or, you could (b) figure out that if you do X physical thing to your brain, Y experiences result, in which case ... you're done? All questions answered
[10:25:04] <pompolic> well ok
[10:25:15] <pompolic> maybe it's just a big deal to me that you can explain mystic shit materially
[10:25:28] <pompolic> check your living among sane people privilege :p
[10:25:31] <PlanckWalk> I respect the people who try to test things like DMT entity objective existence.  I think their risk profile is nowhere like mine, though.
[10:25:49] <pompolic> man
[10:25:56] <pompolic> that's one of those tiresome thnigs
[10:26:00] <pompolic> things*
[10:26:16] <Obormot\Gaia> pompolic: I mean, why wouldn't you be able to, right? What is "mystic shit"? It's some category of experience people have, or thoughts people have, right? Well... people, and their experiences, and their thoughts, all take place in physical reality, so...
[10:26:26] <pompolic> yes
[10:26:29] <pompolic> i reiterate
[10:26:33] <Obormot\Gaia> Yeah fair enough
[10:26:40] <pompolic> this took me way too much to figure out
[10:27:04] <pompolic> and the more i figure out the more i appreciate rationality
[10:27:14] <pompolic> way too much time*
[10:27:30] <pompolic> i could use it but i did not grok it, i suppose
[10:29:58] <Obormot\Gaia> adiabatic: Anyway, you know, I do actually find it striking that so many of the "enlightened" people I've seen in discussions like this really are dicks, noticeably more than average
[10:30:34] <Obormot\Gaia> Valentine, that Indian guy who came to SSC to bluster about how he could beat everyone up...
[10:31:25] <Obormot\Gaia> (And it seems almost unfair to bring up all those gurus and Zen masters and what have you who were just *absolutely horrible* people)
[10:31:37] <saturn2> what's non-naive materialism?
[10:32:03] <Obormot\Gaia> It's materialism after meeting David Chalmers
[10:32:07] <pompolic> lol
[10:32:27] <saturn2> hm
[10:33:05] <pompolic> i made up "naive materialism" to denote "when someone discovers materialism as a teacher's password"
[10:33:48] <Obormot\Gaia> I think it's an acceptable (if usually superfluous) term, since the non-naive version that I semi-facetiously just described does exist
[10:33:58] <pompolic> yeah
[10:34:07] <PlanckWalk> I hope the Wikipedia article on Chalmers is butchering his views
[10:34:08] <pompolic> i think i shouldn't have used it, since it caused confusion
[10:34:22] <Obormot\Gaia> PlanckWalk: Why hope?
[10:35:25] <PlanckWalk> Because I can't see why anyone would take him seriously if his views are accurately represented there, and there are a number of people I respect who do take him seriously.
[10:37:31] <saturn2> i'd say the quality of his ideas has unusually high variance
[10:39:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> I agree with that assessment
[10:39:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: Regardless of anything else Chalmers may say/write, the articulation of the Hard Problem is extremely valuable

[10:42:50] <Robomot> Inside-A Short Film on Multiple Personality  (2002) - YouTube (Dir: Trevor Sands, US, 2002)
[10:43:32] <PlanckWalk> Yes, that is true
[10:49:53] <rsaarelm> The whole "yes, you experienced weird shit, it's because your brain was on the fritz" thing is interesting. People before, I dunno, 1950s? seem to have been overall confused about that because computationalism wasn't really understood as a materialist thing before then.
[10:50:13] <rsaarelm> So we're left with a whole cultural tradition from people who plain don't understand that viewpoint.
[10:50:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, I don't know that you even need computationalism, per se
[10:50:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just the understanding that your brain is where your experiences happen
[10:50:56] <rsaarelm> You need to have some sort of hands-on sense that your brain is actually made of atoms and there isn't a magic soul for the thoughts.
[10:51:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that things have physical causes, just in general
[10:51:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, fair enough
[10:51:09] <rsaarelm> This seems to have been basically impossible before people had the idea of computers.
[10:51:57] <PlanckWalk> As in, materialism was around as an idea, but hadn't been pushed in that direction?
[10:53:00] <rsaarelm> I keep wondering how much it contributes to pepole going crazy after having a psychotic episode is just that they've gone their whole life without ever understanding that it's possible for their brain to lie to them.
[10:54:14] <saturn2> people tried to understand materialism but they made some big mistakes

[10:54:41] <rsaarelm> So once the brain very vocally goes "space aliens are real and they have just opened a telepathic conduit to your mind informing you that you are the messiah" once, well, now you got to try to figure out everything anew from the frame of you being the messiah and space aliens being real.

[10:55:36] <rsaarelm> Materialism was around as an idea, but people had very vague ideas about how it'd work for something like a human brain.
[10:55:53] <saturn2> rsaarelm: some of that, but also some of just not having propositional beliefs at all until psychosis
[10:56:31] <rsaarelm> Jerusalem syndrome is also some fascinating stuff.
[10:57:20] <rsaarelm> Apparently that goes away once the person has had the episode, but the thing where the episode happens to begin with is some voodoo shit.

[10:57:51] *** Lord_of_Life_ is now known as Lord_of_Life
[10:59:50] <rsaarelm> And in addition to people having vague ideas for how materialism would work for a human brain, people obviously need lots and lots of everyday psychological thinking for modeling their own and other people's minds, so you need to make the mental jump of at least realizing there's the span to be crossed between everyday mind-modeling and complex constellations of atoms spinning in the void.
[11:00:22] <pompolic> from what i can tell, pretty much
[11:01:15] <rsaarelm> And this thing seems to be a really basic building block of the present-day materialist-scientific worldview, though you need to dig a bit before it becomes evident, while it just isn't a thing for any intellectual culture before the 1800s and only very tentatively around until the mid-1900s.
[11:01:16] <pompolic> specifically, "it's all happening in my head" is pretty hard to even generate, let alone not update from, if all you have access to is people who just completely don't understand that their brain can lie
[11:01:25] <pompolic> not update away from*
[11:02:18] <rsaarelm> I guess the whole bayesian business comes in when you go "okay so it's all brain stuff then, so, solipsism?"
[11:02:26] <adiabatic> I want to say "but what if you notice your brain starting to lie in an entirely _new_ way?" but I don't know if this is actually germane or not
[11:03:35] <rsaarelm> Like, you want to tell the difference between Psychosis Joe getting a conviction that aliens just telepathically told him he's the messiah and Andrew Wiles getting a conviction that he can totally prove Fermat's Theorem.
[11:04:04] <rsaarelm> This was apparently a very concrete problem for John Nash who had both sorts of thoughts.
[11:04:35] <pompolic> is there really? it just seems that it's holding any old belief with a confidence higher than warranted by evidence
[11:04:48] <pompolic> or perhaps always failing to update priors downwards
[11:05:17] <saturn2> adiabatic: as usual, trust but verify
[11:05:34] <rsaarelm> The problem is that you need smarts and knowledge for doing the verification.
[11:06:13] <rsaarelm> Also a trusted, competent social network is very helpful.
[11:06:26] <rsaarelm> People can lack all three.
[11:07:05] <saturn2> of course
[11:10:04] <saturn2> there's no royal road
[11:10:05] <rsaarelm> Like, there's a *huge* amount of external work packed into "what my brain just told me happened would violate well-established laws of physics so it's very likely I'm not conceiving a thing that happened in reality at face value" with the laws of physics being established in the first place and you having build a good enough model of them in your own mind that you can test random perceived
[11:10:08] <rsaarelm> events against them.
[11:10:55] <nshepperd> if all else fails, roll a bunch of quantum dice and take the drugs they tell you to, then interact repeatedly with the environment until only the Everett branch that took the right drugs to become sane survives

[12:06:53] <|dbotdan> Elías Eyþórsson (@eliaseythorsson, 2021-08-07 14:16): ‘I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Iceland (93% of the population 16 years of age or older vaccinated) is experiencing its largest wave of Covid-19 yet. At this point, I think it is unreasonable to assume that increased vaccine coverage will result in herd immunity’ Images:

[12:07:53] <PapuaHardyNet> there's a stereotype that all soviet technology was made more resilient and stable in comparison to american capitalistic technology and tools
[12:08:01] <PapuaHardyNet> how well does this stereotype hold?
[12:08:15] <rmmh> I thought the stereotype was that the soviet refrigerator weighs 1000lbs
[12:08:27] <rmmh> because their quotas are by weight
[12:21:28] <PapuaHardyNet> that's propaganda by evil capitalists
[12:23:26] <Obormot\Gaia> PapuaHardyNet: Soviet bedsheets: check. Soviet can opener: check. Soviet silverware: check. Soviet cookware: check. Pretty much all the Soviet stuff I have fits your description... but on the other hand, it would, wouldn't it? There's rather an obvious selection effect...
[12:25:10] <Obormot\Gaia> PapuaHardyNet: Of course, we can compare directly, sometimes. For instance, some time ago we were looking at, I think, saucepans or some such, on Amazon, and there was one which was described as "heavy duty" which was 0.4mm thick. Then I went to the kitchen and measured one of my Soviet cookpots and it was ... 6mm thick.
[12:26:10] <Obormot\Gaia> (Oh yes, and I almost forgot - Soviet combat knife: check.)
[12:26:23] <PapuaHardyNet> makes sense, survivorship bias plays a huge part
[12:27:30] <rmmh> 6mm? wow
[12:28:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> I think the lid was 6mm and the walls were 4.5 or something at the thinnest ... something like that, I can dig up the logs I guess, or re-measure
[12:28:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway it was a full order of magnitude difference
[12:28:31] <rmmh> weren't you talking about cast aluminum before
[12:28:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yep
[12:28:37] <enterprisey> that's quite thick
[12:28:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which, by the way, is an interesting ... counterexample? Sort of?
[12:28:51] <rmmh> are you wandering around your kitchen? I still get disoriented by your nick switching
[12:29:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, if you look at (American-made!) Guardian Service cookware, that stuff is *very* heavy-duty (aluminum)
[12:29:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> But it hasn't been made for decades! And nothing you can get here *now* is anywhere near as good
[12:30:13] <rmmh> maybe that's part of the cast iron meme
[12:30:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> So to a certain extent, it's not "Soviet vs. Western", it's also "old vs. new"
[12:30:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, I don't know about "meme"
[12:30:26] <rmmh> it's not that cast iron is actually incredible, it's just that it's one of the few pots that you can still buy that's massive
[12:30:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Could be, could be
[12:30:47] <rmmh> esp with weight=quality
[12:32:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> My grandmother has a couple of Guardian Service pieces (no idea where she got them, might've been gifts soon after we came here), and wow, they are really impressive

[12:34:41] <PapuaHardyNet> of course there are many things that aren't very lindy: electronics aren't lindy in terms of performance, but in terms of reliability they might very well be
[12:35:32] <PapuaHardyNet> sidenote: the TN panel on the X230 is absolutely atrocious
[12:35:45] <PapuaHardyNet> I've been spoiled by IPS panels
[12:37:11] <rmmh> screens have really gotten a lot better
[12:38:31] <saturn2> i don't think it's a selection effect, old stuff actually was better
[12:39:42] <saturn2> the concept of "reliability engineering" only coalesced in its current form sometime after 1980
[12:39:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: I was saying that the selection effect is: of course all the Soviet stuff I have is the stuff that was good and built to last, because all the stuff that was bad or flimsy, well, I'm not gonna still have it, am I?
[12:40:14] <rmmh> capitalism has shaved off all excess material to save a few percent in costs
[12:40:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: (This was re: Soviet vs. Western, not re: old vs. new)
[12:41:52] <rmmh> one of the funniest examples of this is seagate's 7200.11 where they just... used too thin of material on the drive heads and it would crack
[12:42:01] <rmmh> failure rate of >30%
[12:42:43] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: ok but you're also selecting american stuff for not being bad or flimsy, or trying to and failing

[23:04:17] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Finally, the influence of Mr. Thiel, a founder of PayPal, whom Mr. Vance has called a “mentor to me,” appears to have been decisive in Mr. Vance’s embrace of Trumpism. An outspoken and somewhat rare conservative in Silicon Valley, Mr. Thiel addressed the 2016 Republican convention and advised the Trump transition team. He is a fierce critic of China and global trade
[23:04:17] <feepbot> and a supporter of restrictionist immigration policies, and Mr. Vance has moved toward all those positions. Mr. Thiel, who did not respond to an interview request, is also paying for a super PAC for another protege, Blake Masters, in a Senate race in Arizona. In March, Mr. Thiel brokered a meeting between Mr. Vance and Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago, the former president’s resort in
[23:04:17] <feepbot> Florida. Mr. Vance made amends for his earlier criticism and asked Mr. Trump to keep an open mind, according to people briefed on the meeting. If Mr. Trump were going to attack Mr. Vance — as he has other Republican 2022 candidates around the country whom he perceives to be disloyal — he probably would have done so already.'

This was in response to their negative reviews of Emmerich and Devlin's earlier films Stargate (1994) and Independence Day (1996). The film also co-opted their trademark Thumbs up/Thumbs down method of rating films by depicting Mayor Ebert's campaign as "Thumbs Up for New York!" and Gene giving Ebert a thumbs down at the end of the film when he 
[23:10:20] <dbohdan> finally decides he has had enough of his abuse and quits. When the real Siskel and Ebert reviewed the film on their show, they gave it two thumbs down and Siskel said the filmmakers spoofing them was "petty" and said "If you're going to go through the trouble of putting us in a monster movie, why don't you at least take advantage of having the monster either eat or squash us".'  https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120685/trivia/

[23:19:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Post about AI alignment debates. Ok. First comment starts like this: "I think both sides of this debate are missing the point, and that makes me sad. We’re busy arguing over arcane talking points while the substance is lurking in the shadows." ... and then goes on to spout absolute nonsense that is not even, like, 101-level, which makes blatantly obvious that the dude is completely ignorant of the existing literature /
[23:19:20] <Obormot\Arcturus>  points-counterpoints / anything
[23:19:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> And ... no one responds to say "actually lol you are a dumb idiot and here's links why"

[23:48:45] <quanticle> You say nothing because you're not a Karen
[23:48:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> First - the "correct" responses (the ones that have the "Good choice! blah blah" note attached) all seem patronizing and canned; I can't imagine who the heck they are supposed to convince
[23:48:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Second: this amazing correction at the bottom of the article:
[23:49:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Correction: May 20, 2021
[23:49:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> A previous version of this article misstated a fact in a possible reply in the interactive section. Covid has killed more than three million people, not more people than were killed in both world wars."
[23:49:27] <quanticle> Man, Covid hasn't even killed half as many Jews as Hitler
[23:49:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm
[23:50:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> You know that's actually an interesting question: has covid killed more, or fewer, Jews than would be expected by population %?
[23:50:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> On the one hand: more likely to live in cities, so more likely to be exposed
[23:50:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> (esp. NYC)
[23:50:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> On the other hand: more likely to vaccinate (likely political orientation)
[23:50:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> On the third hand: the last thing is reversed for Orthodox/etc.

[23:52:03] <dbohdan> kuudes: Oh, that pun was long overdue

[23:55:29] <RiversHaveWings> "Cabanac and colleagues ran a selection of abstracts from Microprocessors and Microsystems and other journals through a tool that can identify whether texts have been generated by the artificial-intelligence tool GPT.

[23:55:54] <RiversHaveWings> "Analysis revealed that papers published after February 2021 had an acceptance time that was five times shorter, on average, than those published before that date.
