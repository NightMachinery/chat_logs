[15:18:30] <StayHungry> Afternoon, comrades
[15:19:23] <StayHungry> I believe sed deserves to be included in this table of mine within its BONUS section https://dpaste.org/6ytv/slim
[15:23:42] <StayHungry> Awk, as you see, offers split/join-based approach, with Sed, i guess, only rearranging of capture groups is possible
[15:43:50] *** Quits: jetchisel (jetchisel@user/jetchisel) (Quit: Unfortunately time is always against us -- [Morpheus])
[15:48:43] <StayHungry> echo 23-07-1821 | sed -E "s|([0-9]+)-([0-9]+)-([0-9]+)|\3-\2-\1|g" seems to be the best way, right?
[15:51:49] <lopid> more or less
[15:52:44] <StayHungry> you see how to optimize it further?
[15:53:44] <lopid> not really an optimisation: sed 's/\([0-9]\{2\}\)-\([0-9]\{2\}\)-\([0-9]\{4\}\)/\3-\2-\1/'
[15:54:22] <StayHungry> ah, backwards compatibility with outdated sed incarnations
[15:54:54] <lopid> more important are the quotes
[15:57:01] <StayHungry> thank you, sir
[15:58:18] <earnestly> It's not "outdated"
[16:00:11] <StayHungry> it was not easy to find sed that does not support -E, but even that tot from 2003 has -r :)
[16:03:19] <lopid> a mac?
[16:05:42] <earnestly> It's not about sed, BRE is a different form of regex
[16:07:16] <earnestly> Thought to be fair they do call BRE obsolete
[16:07:33] <earnestly> And sed -E is, I think, slated for the next POSIX standard
[16:08:29] * StayHungry looks up BRE
[16:09:17] <StayHungry> too many definitions, what is BRE here? :D
[16:10:13] <lopid> https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.html
[16:12:15] <StayHungry> basic regular expressions, noted
[16:13:00] <StayHungry> also no support of \d, even with -E
[16:13:57] <StayHungry> only lengthy and scary [[:digit:]] is supported
[16:37:51] <geirha> most modern languages use perl-style regexes, which varyingly support \s \d \w and the likes
[16:38:23] <geirha> sed, awk and grep predate perl and have more "primitive" regular expression dialects
[16:39:18] <ormaaj> most modern languages defer to ECMAScript since C++ inherited it.
[16:39:47] <lopid> most lee come at night. mostly
[16:41:49] <ormaaj> bug-for-bug perl compatibility might be a bit tricky
