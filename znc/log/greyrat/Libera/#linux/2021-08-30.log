[00:01:17] <[[R]]> NewLeaf: i have a fresh fedora, and while qt is installed... 5 seconds and its gone...
[00:01:20] <NewLeaf> as omero pointed out: omero
[00:01:21] <NewLeaf> 14:26:20
[00:01:21] <NewLeaf> in case no one remembers: the original question was: |2021-08-29+20:58:05|   NewLeaf)) Real quick, I thought of another question to ask: Does anyone know of a GTK Only Distro or know of a way to search for such a thing ? .... Not how do I remove stuff to make QT no longer installed in my distro? or How do I replace distro components that use QT
[00:01:22] <NewLeaf> with GTK alternatives... I want a GTK only distro that as it seems doesn't exist.
[00:01:36] <[[R]]> NewLeaf: because there would be no pint
[00:01:38] <[[R]]> because thats just stupid
[00:01:48] <NewLeaf> dang it it quoted the extra part I was trying to add
[00:01:50] <Psi-Jack[m]> ^
[00:02:01] <Khaytsus> Touch the doll where the bad QT hurt you
[00:02:07] <NewLeaf> [[R]] I'm sure everyone things something is stupid
[00:02:13] <NewLeaf> thinks*
[00:02:15] <Dagmar> It's more important that people stomp their feet and make distributions meet whatever arbitrary criteria they've set

[00:02:52] <omero> NewLeaf: it makes a bit more sense now...
[00:02:53] <Guest53> Install any distribution/flavour that doesn't include X/Wayland in the base install and you're probably Qt free.
[00:02:56] <[[R]]> NewLeaf: not including a package used by like half of graphical apps... because of some retarded notion that you dont want it even installable... IS STUPID
[00:03:01] <omero> but ... ahm...
[00:03:09] <[[R]]> NewLeaf: F- for the trolling attempt
[00:03:28] <omero> its rather difficult because ... you know... some things are specific
[00:03:42] <omero> I mean you cant have equivalent replacements
[00:03:46] <Khaytsus> I guess I"m weird.  If I like a tool, I use it, I don't care what toolkit it is.
[00:03:48] <NewLeaf> [[R]] Linus thought minix was STUPID too
[00:03:55] <[[R]]> NewLeaf: minix IS stupid...
[00:04:01] <NewLeaf> maybe
[00:04:05] <Dagmar> No minix is what it was meant to be
[00:04:10] <omero> in other words, you cant have a GTK-only or the Qt-only
[00:04:15] <NewLeaf> but it still exists and people still use it
[00:04:21] <[[R]]> yes... all 5 people
[00:04:30] <[[R]]> omero: you could... but the person doing it would be branded a total retard
[00:04:35] <NewLeaf> so maybe I wanna be one of the 5 that doesn't use Qt
[00:04:40] <[[R]]> so don't use it
[00:04:43] <[[R]]> problem solved
[00:04:48] <Guest53> FWIW the only dependency I have on Qt is VLC.

[00:05:51] <NewLeaf> [[R]] nevermind clearly you aren't the right person to ask; I can probably just regress and use an older distro that still was GTK based
[00:05:53] <[[R]]> omero: to troll...

[00:18:08] <Guest53> akk: It wasn't a comment on the merits of any of those things, just that people often want to exclude particular pieces of software :)
[00:18:34] <akk> And in most distros, they can do that, pretty easily.
[00:18:53] <omero> so all are saying that one cannot run its own system the way he likes anymore?

[07:18:07] <ayecee> No1x3r0: the difference is whether this is a boot hang, or just some messages that bother you that disappear.
[07:18:10] <sheep> or do you just want to prevent these error messages from appearing?

[08:23:27] <uwharrie> I've found it useful to both ignore them and anyone replying to them. Occasionally makes it irritating when there are lots of responses with no highlights

[10:04:56] <jim> can't be sure, but it sounds like the drive might be working, and the ui is doing the weird open/close thing

[10:05:43] <alkisg> Guest57: I haven't read the whole conversation, but in some cases, USB disks don't get enough power from USB ports, so they powerdown immediately when they realize it. If it's a rotational disk, it might be the issue

[10:08:32] <jim> it might be worth getting another usb enclosure, one that has a port for an external power supply, which should come with the enclosure

[17:22:33] <euouae> Yeah but I think 2.06 added support for luks2 at least partial, though arch Linux wiki mentions some things
[17:23:38] <Khaytsus> Dagmar: One could argue that there's no point not encrypting these days on modern hardware, but if you aren't, FBE is pretty trivial to do to encrypt a single path
[17:23:44] <mkulko> euouae: it adds support for the luks2 format but not for the much better argon2 password hashing algorithm, so you'll need to use luks2 with PBKDF2 or luks 1
[17:24:04] <Dagmar> For that use-case you might as well just use one encrypted file and handle the filesystem aspect of that yourself

[17:40:39] <Psi-Jack[m]> Correct, EFI can't be.
[17:40:57] <euouae> Ok so boot can be encrypted with luks1 ? That’s what they mean?
[17:41:16] <euouae> I guess efi is the starting point?

[17:41:47] <Dagmar> If all your user data is safe from disclosure, there's not much reason to care about /boot
[17:41:50] <Psi-Jack[m]> boot can be encrypted. What they mean, I can't say. :p
[17:42:09] <Dagmar> Basically, nothing particularly useful to an attacker shoudl ever be in /boot
[17:42:10] <euouae> Hehe ok also dagmar indeed I do follow that
[17:42:13] <Khaytsus> Actually people say they encrypt /boot so the kernels there etc can't be manipulated
[17:42:18] <peetaur> you need to ensure integrity of boot, but not privacy probably
[17:42:41] <euouae> Privacy means people can’t audit specific versions of your kernel but it’s diminishing as daid
[17:42:43] <euouae> said
[17:42:43] <Dagmar> Khaytus: Except no one bothers to do cryptographic checksums of their kernels, or their initrd
[17:42:46] <peetaur> if they can read the kernel in there, there is a higher chance they can map kernel memory and do things though
[17:43:01] <Dagmar> You literally _need_ support from the hardware to usefully go past that point
[17:43:31] <Dagmar> ...and replacing the keychain in UEFI is super-dodgy becaue if you muff it you are generally just "done" with that piece of hardware
[17:43:32] <peetaur> if you didn't build the kernel yourself, is it even relevant if they can read it from there?
[17:44:04] <euouae> Oh good thing you told me not to replace the key I was thinking of it
[17:44:06] <peetaur> but leaving the keychain alone in UEFI is also dodgy since microsoft (1) has keys (2) leaked the keys  :)

[18:57:04] <jim> with partitions, you make partitions using a partition tool, format them with a filesystem directly, and mount the partition with the filesystem. with LVM, instead of putting filesystems in partitions directly, you put 'LVM physical volumes' in partitions, then you make a 'volume group' (which is just a list of physical volumes), and put physical volumes in the volume groups, then you can make 'logical volumes', and these are what you would format and
[18:57:04] <jim> mount, and they got allocated from a volume group.

[19:39:25] <Two_Dogs_> opensuse installer is an excellent restore point
[19:39:29] <jim> webstrand, there are a handful of programs that do backup... some were designed for the purpose, some, like cat, had more and more things they could do
[19:40:04] <uwharrie> rsnapshot isn't ideal, but I haven't been bothered enough to investigate and execute a switch to something like borg or restic
[19:40:07] <koollman> webstrand: hdd connected to a raspberry pi, then slow-ish rsync to remote server
[19:40:31] <koollman> so I have local archives regularly, and hopefully remote archives that aren't too old
[19:40:39] <elagost> webstrand: laptop uses syncthing with the nas to send stuff that changes frequently in real time. stuff like ~/Music is copied to the nas manually. nas is backed up to another hard drive stored in a safe. nas also does cloud backups.
[19:40:40] <jim> rsync, cp -a, tar, are examples of existing programs that came to be used for other purposes...
[19:41:06] <koollman> if the network is really bad, sneakernet works.  Just take some hdd with you from time to time, going to work, or to some other places
[19:41:10] <webstrand> so you'd keep recent backups online, and only occasionally make long-term offline backups?
[19:41:31] <jim> bakula, borg backup and others in that category, were designed to do backup, most have scheduling
[19:41:56] <webstrand> yeah, bandwidth caps are my real issue. Netflix eat 80%, and there's not enough left over for uploading

[22:34:36] <Elon_Satoshi> There's a problem I've had in the past with large tar.gz files: In order to list the contents or to extract a single file from the tar.gz, the whole thing has to be extracted
[22:34:40] <ananke> djph: I don't recall what AIX does, but as a counterexample: solaris doesn't wipe /tmp
[22:34:49] <Dagmar> That's because the admins frequently weren't real bright and left /tmp attached to / and then users could fill up / and send an already fragile machine straight to malfunction hell
[22:35:17] <djph> ananke: honestly, it could be that a script was written.  I don't maintain those systems (thankfully)
[22:35:20] <ravan> Well that is i believe where tmpfs was created
[22:35:21] <Elon_Satoshi> Or at least for listing the contents of the archive. Maybe for extracting a single file it can scan until it finds that file and only end up extracting most of the tar.gz
[22:35:39] <ravan> since it is in the volatile memory

[22:50:48] <Elon_Satoshi> > individual

[23:37:56] <SmashingX> I'm trying to find out what -a does on the cp command. manual says:   -a, --archive               same as -dR --preserve=all
[23:37:56] <Guest53> Alternatively, ditch whatever bootloader is installed and use rEFInd (assuming you're on an EFI system)
[23:38:10] <SmashingX> Does someone know in plain English what it does?

[23:38:38] <Velvet> i couldn't understand rEFInd.....i've tinkered with grub customizer a little

[23:49:57] <Psi-Jack[m]> D'uh!
[23:50:10] <uwharrie> Elon_Satoshi: because when you use the archive for restoration, you want the ownership, permissions, and timestamps to stay the same
[23:50:20] <codebam> if you're just archiving media it probably doesn't matter much if the permissions are lost, but for an entire home folder it would
[23:50:36] <Psi-Jack[m]> With permissions/metadata INCLUDED in the backup, you can choose to restore them, and it can be optional. To NOT include them gives no choice.
