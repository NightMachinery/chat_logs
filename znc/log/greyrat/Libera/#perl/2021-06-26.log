[00:18:30] <Grinnz> if that helps :)

[05:09:24] <pflanze> ->{ } and ->[ ] can't be implemented as methods, right, only via Tie (which, AFAIR, is horribly convoluted and slow, right?)?
[05:09:32] <pflanze> s/as/via/
[05:10:12] <Grinnz> they can be overloaded, which is not as bad as tie
[05:10:19] <Grinnz> if it's a blessed object you're talking about
[05:10:27] <pflanze> Ah, ok trying.
[05:10:52] <Grinnz> hoever, if it's a blessed object, you can't overload the kind of access you use for storage (most objects are hash based storage)
[05:10:59] <Grinnz> since that would just be an infinite loop
[05:11:19] <pflanze> Ahh, I seem to remember I ran into this.
[05:11:36] <Grinnz> another benefit of the Object::Pad structure, where there's no externally accessible storage so you can overload whatever you want
[05:12:07] <Grinnz> Dios was a past attempt at that but fieldhashes are kind of a hack
[05:12:51] <pflanze> What do you mean with externally accessible storage?
[05:13:13] <pflanze> You mean hashes that also need hash access for field references?
[05:14:11] <Grinnz> yes, or any access that can also be done externally
[05:14:25] <pflanze> OK, you meant an infinite loop there; I had another one in the past.
[05:14:27] <Grinnz> dios and Object::Pad objects can only physically access their fields from the object definition itself
[05:14:41] <Grinnz> so overloading dereferences can't conflict with that
[05:14:42] <pflanze> I see, closure based.
[05:14:51] <Grinnz> sorta, yeah
[05:14:52] <pflanze> Haven't used Object::Pad before
[05:15:01] <Grinnz> Object::Pad is kind of a whole new paradigm for it
[05:15:15] <Grinnz> where attributes are instance-specific lexicals
[05:15:56] *** Joins: deadmarshal (~deadmarsh@95.38.114.168)
[05:16:06] <pflanze> Makes sense. I guess those 'fields' are then also always private, never protected or public (in Java speak).
[05:16:22] <Grinnz> anyway, for production usage i generally stick to Moo and avoid the need for hashref overloading
[05:16:25] <Grinnz> for now
[05:16:47] <Grinnz> yeah the current implementation only does private
[05:18:46] <pflanze> For my work I need read-only, update-via-copy objects. I wonder whether I should start thinking about how to do that publicly instead of just in my FP::Struct module.
[05:19:15] <nirnam> Dios just failed test on me, should I report that or just force?
[05:19:46] <Grinnz> pflanze: is => 'lazy' attributes with Moo, or https://metacpan.org/pod/Class::Tiny::Immutable might be of interest for really simple things
[05:19:46] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Class::Tiny::Immutable - Minimalist class construction, with read-only attributes - metacpan.org ]
[05:19:58] <pflanze> OTOH to be fair, the places where I need {} [] overloading "should" all become XS code in the future for performance reasons, and Object::Pad might be slower than hashes (who knows).

[05:29:52] <pflanze> Just in case anyone's got an opinion: I'm creating a set implementation right now (a set as in, only holds 1 instance of an equal value).

[21:33:02] <xenu> and for how long
[21:33:47] <simcop2387> that is it's main purpose, but a consequence of that is that it also means that someone accusing us of being abusive can be proven right or wrong.  which is why most of the time i've brought it up i've also mentioned it being used to disprove op abuse

[21:36:43] <simcop2387> xenu: i definitely don't want it to become another CAT like thing, but i also want it to be possible for it to be used to actually say we're acting like horrible people if and only if we are.

[22:11:28] <Grinnz> don't know for sure but i think it's ultimately due to those same discoveries
[22:11:42] <xenu> yeah that sounds likely
[22:11:45] <xenu> but i wonder who snitched
[22:12:19] <xenu> and why it's suddenly a problem, the perl6-n-word issue has been known for a long time
[22:12:58] <xenu> and i'm not sure if commit messages count as 'statements'
[22:13:01] <xenu> i guess technically they do
[22:17:22] <Grinnz> xenu: i think most people who knew about it thought that 1) the dists were actually all removed successfully, 2) he wasn't still doing this shit
[22:17:30] <Grinnz> both turned out to be false
[22:18:25] <Grinnz> personally i've thought he should be nowhere near authority, but that's raku's and TPF's (apparently) problem
[22:18:49] <xenu> well TPF is our problem
[22:18:59] <xenu> it affects the whole community
[22:19:03] <Grinnz> yeah, i didnt know he was trying to be involved in TPF
[22:20:45] <Grinnz> the clear lack of consequences for his behavior from both liz and sam are how we got to this point

[22:22:23] <xenu> i don't if it's true that he's trying to be involved in TPF, but we all remember his girlfriend's conflict of interest in mst's case 
[22:22:42] <simcop2387> xenu: i never heard about that
[22:23:02] <thowe> "the perl6-n-word issue has been known" ... wha-huh?!
[22:23:20] <xenu> simcop2387: tyil is a boyfriend of sam, tyil has been in conflict in mst

[22:25:15] <Grinnz> thowe: mst banned tyil from #perl6 at the time for attempting to upload that dist, liz got pissed at mst for doing so, blah blah
[22:25:33] <thowe> I did, but your statement made me think that there had been more in the past, making a pattern that went unaddressed.
[22:25:46] <Grinnz> i mean, it is obviously a pattern
[22:26:01] <Grinnz> but this dist thing only happened once, it just didn't get fully resolved apparently
[22:26:21] <thowe> liz was OK with an n-bomb? ...  I'm a bit incredulous about that one
[22:26:42] <xenu> tbh personally normally i wouldn't care about that issue at all, but it's pretty hypocritical

[22:30:43] <xenu> we have that policing body, CAT, on its high horse which bans mst from the perl community for life (later changed to 1 year and limited to TPF-controlled spaces)
[22:30:57] <xenu> for an extremely minor infraction
[22:31:17] <xenu> and yet one of their members is completely ok with tyil's behavior
[22:32:20] <ehuelsmann[m]> I'm sorry to learn that a community as old as Perl's is this immature.
[22:32:41] <Grinnz> it's especially bad when you actually understand what mst was banned for which was *not* hate speech as the CAT report caused people to think
[22:33:05] <xenu> yes, they committed libel in their "transparency" report
[22:33:09] <ehuelsmann[m]> Especially where we are already as few as we are.
[22:34:15] <xenu> of course what mst did is completely irrelevant because everyone knows that's not the *actual* reason why they convicted him
[22:35:55] <xenu> they just dig out a random incident from the past to have an excuse
[22:36:11] <xenu> because the original incident with sawyer was not enough
[22:36:31] <Grinnz> yeah, it was painfully obvious "went digging for dirt" to anyone who isn't already predisposed to think mst is terrible
[22:37:12] <Grinnz> in their report they didn't say they looked at it because it was also reported to them, they looked at it to establish a pattern of behavior
[22:37:53] <Grinnz> anyway we've litigated this plenty
[22:38:41] <xenu> the problem is we accomplished nothing, CAT pretends that there's no problem and they continue to exist
[22:38:55] <xenu> and they have never retracted anything
[22:39:17] <xenu> apart from publishing that "sorry we did everything right" post
[22:39:29] <Grinnz> CAT didn't even publish that, the TPF board did
[22:39:34] <xenu> doesn't matter
[22:39:39] <xenu> in fact
[22:40:22] <xenu> we should always be saying 'TPF' instead of 'CAT'
[22:40:31] <xenu> because ultimately everything is TPF's fault
[22:40:41] <haj> I guess xenu is referring to the first update because the TPF statement did *not* say "we did everything right"

[22:42:57] <xenu> the only mistake they are admiting is the scope of the ban
[22:43:31] <xenu> and that post reaffirms that the lack of transparency and due process was intended
[22:43:40] <haj> Nope.  They also are admitting that the report was published before being reviewed
[22:44:24] <xenu> it ignores the issue of libellous framing of the incidents in the transparency report
[22:44:37] <xenu> and it lies about contacting the subjects of the investigation
