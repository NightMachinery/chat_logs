[19:04:28] <labrador> Klisper[m], the llogic would be the same in any language ;__;
[19:04:42] <Klisper[m]> C doesn't have as much convenience
[19:04:57] <Klisper[m]> i did shit with vectors in cp p
[19:06:25] <labrador> Klisper[m], I dunno man the worst soln I can come up with is to find the largest number then skip comparision if its equal to that number
[19:06:41] <labrador> But it doesn't extend well to say n-xth largest number for any x
[19:07:26] <Klisper[m]> i mean u would sort that array in ascending order and then you will select the 1st number using array[1] and then print it out using printf or something
[19:07:28] <Klisper[m]> idk
[19:07:51] <labrador> Klisper[m], ok thats a better idea lol
[19:08:00] <Klisper[m]> lol
