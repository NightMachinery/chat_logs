[00:00:54] <GenTooMan> well I can't answer why that was apart from I did use backports for several specific packages it's odd that it updated libreoffice stuff and haphazardly.
[00:02:06] <somiaj> yea, tracking down why this happened may be a bit difficult. Pinning is kinda of a poor method for dealing with backport versions, but it is how apt works
[00:02:43] <somiaj> but due to this one of the biggest issues with backports is ensuring only packages from backports that need to be installed for a particular task are installed, since it is silly and unadvised to upgarde everything

[00:19:24] <somiaj> the problem is setting bullseye-backports as default is only asking for pain. Backports are nice, but not a perfect system to integrate into stable due to some strange issues.

[09:03:46] <Aarch64debian> !stable
[09:03:46] <dpkg> [stable] The status of a Debian release when no packages will be added or version-bumped, and changes will only fix security issues and critical bugs. Packages can be removed in rare circumstances. The current stable version of Debian is Bullseye (11.x); ask me about <releases>. Security bugs are fixed in stable by backporting the fix to the stable version (ask me about <security backports>). https://wiki.debian.org/DebianStable
[09:06:43] <knghtbrd> Aarch64debian: there's a thing on phoronix discussing that Debian's browser situation in stable is ‚Ä¶ untennable. MULTIPLE major CVEs remain unfixed due to dependencies for the fixes not being in stable.
[09:12:01] <somiaj> xx: despite the info in that article just being wrong (About the reason). Chromium is probably going to be dropped from debian and firefox-esr is in the works, it just requires backporting the full build chain which takes some time to do and test.

[09:22:17] <aaro> maybe a more sincere explanation is needed like, if you want an up to date browser download it from upstream
[09:23:17] <somiaj> Have you read over all the CVEs and understand the risk, or just see a CVE and think you are now unsecure?
[09:24:57] <somiaj> Though the bug is about the state of firefox-esr, which it is in the works, but due to build chain issues might take a bit longer than normal DSA's you would expect
[09:25:03] <Mortalhys[m]> Maintaining secure systems isn't just about patching when a package comes out, but also to be aware of security holes and the fact if they are patched or not. If they are not patched, and browsers on Debian are by far not the only affected software here, you need to be aware of the risk.
[09:25:20] <somiaj> This way users know the current state of things, and can make their own decisions based on their treath model.
[09:26:03] <somiaj> Yea, browsers just get the biggest spotlight due to the fact they have so many regular exploits. Maybe browsers shouldn't add new code so quickly.
[09:26:18] <Mortalhys[m]> Also, this is nothing new, especially when it comes to the desktop use of debian. A computer desktop is a very complex thing to maintain, and if you need to make sure you are on the latest patched (and maybe even bleeding edge) software, then Debian stable just isn't the way to go when it comes to a desktop.
[09:27:49] <Mortalhys[m]> For myself, I actually use unstable for my desktops. Which is actually pretty stable.
[09:29:03] <aaro> doesn't really matter what branch you use regarding browsers, thay're all far behind
[09:29:04] <somiaj> Also how one uses a browser can drastically effect the severity of most CVEs. Often the user is one of the bigger security holes.
[09:29:25] <Mortalhys[m]> I got Firefox 95 a day after release on unstable.
[09:29:44] <somiaj> firefox-esr is 91.4.0 in sid which current version.
[09:30:02] *** Quits: riff-IRC (~riff-IRC@user/riff-irc) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:30:32] <Mortalhys[m]> I never used ESR on sid. With non-ESR it's always just a couple of days until it hits.
[09:31:16] *** Joins: riff-IRC (~riff-IRC@user/riff-irc)
[09:31:21] <somiaj> I use stable, mostly because I got to the point I didn't need sid for much for many years. I'm running firefox-esr from mozilla while I wait for the build chain issue to be resolved.
[09:31:27] <aaro> firefox is at version 92 on sid
[09:31:39] <somiaj> ,v firefox
[09:31:40] <judd> Package: firefox on amd64 -- experimental: 92.0-2+b1; sid: 95.0-1
[09:31:55] <somiaj> It is not at version 92
[09:32:02] <Mortalhys[m]> Definitely not.
[09:32:12] <aaro> is just i386 then? my bad
[09:32:43] <aaro> i'm on an old laptop with i386
[09:34:56] <somiaj> https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=firefox&arch=i386&ver=95.0-1&stamp=1638918733&raw=0
[09:36:29] <Mortalhys[m]> I use sid because of gaming. It's handy to have a mostly up-to-date MESA, Kernel and drivers.
[09:37:03] <somiaj> I can see that, though I haven't had much of a problem with recent releases using nvidia non-free drivers
[09:37:40] <somiaj> I find it isn't needed as much as it was 10+ years ago, though I do end up upgrading to testing near the freeze, about that time I do find needing newer stuff is helpful

[10:10:53] <somiaj> Depends on what you like, some things have good wine support, others not so much.
[10:12:00] <somiaj> The winehq packages for debian are quite good if you want newer packages than debian provides. Also I was able to get vulkan to work with directx 11 games and get quite good preformance via some .dll I built. Haven't messed with getting it to work with directx 12 yet (because the stuff I use it for works with dx11)
[10:12:21] <somiaj> but it is a constant and moving target, I can see not wanting to deal with the work it often takes, and building custom stuff to get some game to work

[18:42:59] <somiaj> It appears that this is more just debian being slow because they have to backport the build chain, while chromium just doesn't have maintainers ahd is looking like it is just going to be dropped from debian (I hear they are going to probably annouce they will drop security support for it in bullseye, but maybe they are trhing to pull some maintainers out of the woodwork first)

[18:44:34] <somiaj> one nice thing is the debian firefox-esr won't run when my newer version fierfox-esr is running, so I'm not worried about accidently launching the older version since I've kept it installed
[18:44:43] <somiaj> (it gives some warning about incompadable version running)
[18:44:44] <Khepra> somiaj: unfortunately that's all debian because debian's own constraints are blocking the port. Rust update, Mesa update. If Mesa is even hard requirement, I think it's possible to build-configure FF without EGL

[18:45:47] <Khepra> still that's a constraint within debian policy
[18:46:01] <somiaj> firefox can be built to support the current version in debian, though maybe the next esr they will drop support for older mesa from the code
[18:46:06] <jelly> is that one of those "isn't needed but you're going to have crappy performance and worse battery usage"

[22:37:16] <jelly> yang, regressions in linux kernel happen.
[22:37:59] <jelly> in theory you would do a bisect and build and test kernels in between to find the first one that breaks things, then report that

[22:41:27] <jelly> I won't suggest that to poeple on irc until someone writes a reasonably reliable script that does all the stuff automatically
[22:42:05] <jelly> yang, it is not likely to get fixed within 5.10.* unless someone (else) reports it
[22:42:10] <jelly> and does the work
[22:42:43] <jelly> you can try to boot new bullseye-backports kernels, those change more
