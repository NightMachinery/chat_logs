[06:22:12] <queue[m]> gj died?
[06:22:17] <queue[m]> rip
[06:22:18] <OhTheCode> yep
[06:22:24] <queue[m]> he was owner
[06:22:24] <jazzy> when I first got on irc I asked him if a textbook I had was ok and he flipped through every page on a pdf to give me a good answer
[06:22:35] <queue[m]> he was young too
[06:22:39] <queue[m]> decent looking guy, good coder
[06:22:45] <queue[m]> wanted to help people, what a shame
[06:22:50] <OhTheCode> jazzy - you knew him in person?
[06:22:52] <jazzy> depression can be rough
[06:22:58] <jazzy> OhTheCode, nope, this was on irc
[06:23:29] <OhTheCode> i wonder if covid had anything to do with it because lots of people are stuck at home, maybe it was a girl
[06:23:29] <chlorine> OhTheCode: no i mean YT channel?
[06:23:30] <queue[m]> id guess he was about 23-25 by now idk maybe a bit younger
[06:23:35] <queue[m]> thats tough
[06:23:43] <OhTheCode> he was 27
[06:23:50] <queue[m]> oh
[06:23:55] <queue[m]> still too young
[06:24:38] <jazzy> covid prob didn't help
[06:24:42] <OhTheCode> i think he spent a lot of time behind the keyboard
[06:25:14] <queue[m]> a lot of us do
[06:25:41] <OhTheCode> yeah, it's not so healthy, i try to do other things, outside interests
[06:25:51] <queue[m]> one of the main reasons i remembered greenjello is because he was normal looking and a good coder, as am i in about 10+ languages

[06:26:08] <queue[m]> there arent a lot of decent looking, normal coders out there unfortunately :/

[06:27:51] <OhTheCode> chlorine - do u wanna see his YT channel?
[06:28:04] <queue[m]> you HAVE to include node/angular/react/vue/nuxt

[06:29:31] <OhTheCode> there is a bit of overlap but it's still hard work

[06:29:52] <queue[m]> or scripting language, as an additive?
[06:30:01] <OhTheCode> they're frameworks
[06:30:11] <queue[m]> or does it all boil down to saying youu undrstand JS really well
[06:30:12] <chlorine> OhTheCode: ye
[06:30:17] <queue[m]> and that you've mastered JS
[06:30:41] <queue[m]> or somewhat have
[06:30:54] <OhTheCode> theres a lot of overlap, i don't know, the syntax is similar to js
[06:31:03] <queue[m]> i understand js
[06:31:22] <queue[m]> its what i knew first, i started using other frameworks just to learn them
[06:31:32] <queue[m]> i wanted to count those as new langs but i guess you're saying i cant
[06:31:52] <chlorine> OhTheCode: what's the channel?
[06:32:00] <OhTheCode> chlorine - https://www.youtube.com/c/aboutscript/videos
[06:32:36] <queue[m]> so under javascript they are just subcategories
[06:32:48] <queue[m]> but when you're counting the number of programming an scripting languages you know

[07:29:02] <chlorine> OhTheCode: maybe your machine is slower than mine but the difference is there.

[07:39:57] <systemfault> In the real world... you would use an iterative solution... or at least you'd memoize the recursive implementation.
[07:40:04] <systemfault> But sure... more work = slower.
[07:42:01] <chlorine> systemfault: so the overhead of calling `p()` is not that big but the number of recursive calls grows so big that it becomes a big issue when calculating larger fibonacci numbers?
[07:43:00] <gde33> also, if you make the inline spagetti long enough optimization may fail :P
[07:43:28] <chlorine> gde33: spagetti?
[07:43:40] <systemfault> Hmm....
[07:43:51] <systemfault> I wonder how much faster that fast code would run on Safari
[07:44:15] <systemfault> Fast on Chrome: "the answer is 14930352. it was found in 0.1335 seconds"
[07:44:33] <systemfault> Fast on Safari: "the answer is 14930352. it was found in 0.094 seconds"
[07:44:51] <systemfault> I expected a larger difference, oh well
[07:44:52] <gde33> *spaghetti
[07:45:15] <chlorine> systemfault: the point is the difference between fast and slow versions. not their individual runtimes.
[07:45:20] <chlorine> gde33: what do you mean?
[07:45:39] <systemfault> chlorine: For sure... was just trying something else..
[07:45:53] <systemfault> Safari has the only engine supporting PTC...
[07:46:25] <chlorine> this is actually not a real world code. i was just trying to make a library and i was testing for optimisation and i realised that funcall is the only overhead here but still the code runs pretty slow.
[07:46:42] <gde33> chlorine: spaghetti code (at least use to) refer to inlining everything rather than reusing repettitive parts in functions or sub routines
[07:46:51] <systemfault> But we're talking about an exponential function here... (IIRC at least)
[07:46:59] <systemfault> It's not factorial... but..
[07:47:15] <chlorine> systemfault: i know.
[07:47:31] <chlorine> systemfault: i delib used fibonacci as it grows fast and is deliciously recursive
[07:47:47] <chlorine> systemfault: it's part of a pattern-matching lib i'm making.
[07:47:49] <systemfault> And it's probably a worst case, I don't even know if the optimizer can inline anything
[07:47:54] <systemfault> Cool :)
[07:48:02] <chlorine> systemfault: not the fibonacci i mean.
[07:48:05] <gde33> chlorine: it use to be the fastest way of doing things but now that there is JIT just in time compilation it can be harmful.

[07:48:21] <chlorine> so is my analysis correct?
[07:49:08] <systemfault> chlorine: I don't believe it's the "number of function calls", it's just that fib is a very bad case for the optimizer
[07:49:34] <chlorine> systemfault: i'm not working on an optimiser but the pattern-matcher does have callbacks after it matches functions.
[07:49:35] <systemfault> What I'm saying is... you may not see that kind of performance degradation in real-world usage.
[07:49:40] <gde33> function calls are much faster than they use to be, almost as if they are not there
[07:49:52] <chlorine> systemfault: so fibonacci doesn't need to be tested to make sure the lib is alright, right?
[07:50:41] <systemfault> Define "alright", if I needed the best performance in some dark corner of my application, I would probably avoid using a fancy pattern matching library
[07:50:52] <chlorine> systemfault: sure.
[07:50:55] <Rockwood> good morning
[07:51:10] <chlorine> systemfault: i've checked other pattern matchers and they're suck for fibonacci too.
[07:51:22] <chlorine> systemfault: but i wanted it to be as fast as it can be.
[07:51:26] <gde33> best performance is a moving fruit :P
[07:51:48] <gde33> systemfault: maybe if its asm?
[07:52:05] <chlorine> systemfault: what makes fib a bad case for optimiser?
[07:53:04] <OhTheCode> i've never done 1 recursion splitting into 2 recursions, i don't know if that makes it a bad case for optimiser
[07:53:19] <systemfault> Recursion possibly makes it impossible to inline anything and you're creating a TON of functions/objects putting pressure on the GC
[07:53:31] <chlorine> systemfault: isn't that what i said?
[07:53:36] <gde33> just use for loops :P
[07:53:36] <OhTheCode> 1, 2, 4, 8,16,32......
[07:53:37] <systemfault> But I'm not a V8 genius, maybe someone has a better explaination.
[07:53:51] <gde33> you cant beat for()
[07:53:53] <chlorine> gde33: as i said, this is not a real world example.
[07:54:06] <chlorine> gde33: the pattern matcher has to use callbacks.
[07:54:14] <OhTheCode> these go straight on the stack i think , all these recursions, 1 in the stack, then 2 , then 4 , then 8
[07:55:09] <chlorine> that's what i said.
[07:55:15] <gde33> I think it should depend on what is in the function
[07:55:16] <Rockwood> what is GC here?
[07:55:17] <chlorine> function call overhead blows up with fib?
[07:55:22] <gde33> garbage collection
[07:55:56] <chlorine> gde33: this is the simplest you get. the library works pretty good in general. i delib put a pathological case to test the speed.
[07:56:53] <OhTheCode> usually recursion is just calling up the next recursion but not into 2, then 4
[07:57:10] <OhTheCode> so this would be a hardcore test, real hardcore
[07:57:54] <chlorine> OhTheCode: ye
[07:57:55] <gde33> in the old days one would just keep writing tests until the end of time hoping for something magical
[07:58:16] <chlorine> gde33: i don't get the point.
[07:58:20] <gde33> who cares with these processors?
[07:58:29] <chlorine> gde33: i don't.
[07:58:35] <chlorine> gde33: it's not about speed.
[07:58:41] <OhTheCode> x=40, i got Uncaught InternalError: too much recursion
[07:58:43] <gde33> maintainable is the goal nowadays I think?
[07:58:53] <chlorine> gde33: i want to make sure that my lib somehow doesn't fuck up regular everyday tasks.
[07:59:15] <gde33> right, write it so that one can read it and see why it fucks up :P
[07:59:39] <chlorine> gde33: oh, i'll put it online once i finish working on it.

[11:13:56] <OnkelTem> How to build js with compression-webpack-plugin so that these static files were served properly? By default they get .gz extensions
[11:14:46] <OnkelTem> Then the web server should be configured to return them instead of js, right? A rewrite?
[11:14:58] <OnkelTem> Or i can include .gz directly in place of .js

[15:01:22] <fakuve> Hi guys so I was going through this code that yesterday samsch: sent to me I just have a quick question . The fact of wrapping all the code in a function such as `app()` that is a programming practice I reckon https://jsfiddle.net/samsch/pa9fdLgq/1/
[15:02:04] <fakuve> I believe that in more complex projects that would be calling another file with all JS code and everything wrapped up there
[15:03:36] *** Joins: irrgit (~irrgit@192.241.175.183)
[15:04:06] <silly> you can't call another file

[15:05:13] <fakuve> so it would be required , and in the other file will be something like `module.exports` ?
[15:05:29] <fakuve> I'm just curious , nothing that I need to implement right now
[15:05:41] <silly> you mean require in a browser?
[15:05:48] <OnkelTem> Do any of you use webpack config written in TypeScript? I wonder how to declare it when it's a function
[15:05:49] <fakuve> yep
[15:05:55] <silly> i haven't done that in a decade
[15:06:02] <fakuve> That wont work I guess as is `nodejs` maybe

[15:08:53] <silly> what samsch did with function app() was to confine variables button1Value and button1 in a scope, to not pollute the outer realm
[15:10:14] <fakuve> alright
[15:10:42] <silly> with const and let, you don't create globals like when using var. So if you wouldn't have any other js in this specific script tag, it would have been totally useless
[15:12:02] <silly> if there were other code in this script tag, what you would have achieved was to separate away the two variables in question from the other code, thus allowing you to reuse variable names in those other parts

[15:31:50] <thykka> but uh.. why are you adding this class?
[15:31:59] <thykka> because there's a CSS selector for a button that's being held down

[16:48:44] <OnkelTem> Do you guys recommend bable or tsc for building react projects?
[16:49:35] <OnkelTem> In a TS discord community I was told that tsc makes a pretty good job on its own
[16:49:45] <OnkelTem> But I wonder now - is it really so?
[16:50:20] <D4mned> how did y'all learn bracktracking !

[16:52:56] <teut> so if  "if" is false  then  all steps on the stack are wasted
[16:53:21] <teut> D4mned
[16:55:11] <teut> that is what happens in backtracking , and there is  another thing that we do , set a variable to something,  do the recursion in    if statement and if it is false we set back the variable to something and then move to else case

[17:06:12] <D4mned> how to i get it to skip it the next time
[17:06:32] <Alexendoo> OnkelTem: I'm not sure about the quality of its codegen, but you generally have a far easier time integrating other tools if you set up babel to strip TS types. And only use tsc as a type checker

[20:19:28] <mikrosis> ? :)
[20:19:34] <mikrosis> material design wouldn't be iOS-style
[20:19:39] <realies> probably react-native
[20:19:43] <bomb> mikrosis: F l u t t e r
[20:19:51] <bomb> but it's not JavaScript
[20:20:01] <bomb> just ignore me XD
[20:20:56] <stenno> yeah react native uses native components which presumably come with the OS UI
[20:21:02] <bomb> I think ionic also has specific theme for Android and iOS
[20:21:15] <mikrosis> hmmmm
[20:21:26] <mikrosis> Flutter is for native apps
[20:21:30] <mikrosis> right?
[20:21:36] <bomb> yeah
[20:21:48] <mikrosis> native apps can't be just opened by following an URL, they have to be installed via app store or sideloaded first, right? :/

[20:21:52] <bomb> it also does web, but not ready yet
[20:22:08] <bomb> ah, you're looking for something for mobile web?
[20:22:21] <bomb> React Native won't do then. Flutter is shakey. I think your best bet is Ionic
[20:22:37] <mikrosis> hmm, I know ionic, I used it some years ago
[20:22:50] <mikrosis> hmm, ionic offers "only" the UI part, right? how it is managed (state/network) is not its job?
[20:22:59] <mikrosis> react/preact and such would use ionic?
[20:25:15] <mikrosis> bomb: hehe, and then there are frameworks below react for communicating data between client and server?

[21:19:00] <ljharb> whatever `fetch` provides. in this case, resp is short for "response", so it's the response object from the fetch

[21:19:58] <ljharb> gitesh: `fetch()` returns a promise. calling `.then` on it creates a new promise, and the new promise's state depends on what the fetch promise does and what the `.then` callback does.

[23:50:05] <ljharb> mikrosis: something being short-lived doesn't change how you'd store and transmit it
[23:50:14] <bomb> if it's gonna be a low traffic app, like for internal use, you can implement one in your DBMS
[23:50:44] <bomb> of course it does, with short-lived messages you might afford storing them in memory
[23:51:00] <bomb> but that's more like ops concern rather than development.
