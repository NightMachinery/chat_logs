[05:38:20] <winny> if you're on a pretty old version of qtwebengine that can happen
[05:38:43] <winny> (pretty old = anything but the latest version)
[05:47:56] <ktprograms> winny: Interesting, that has been happening with me as well, do you think the problem is that Alpine linux uses qtwebengine 5.15.3? Seems like the current lts release is 5.15.7.
[05:48:13] <ktprograms> How much CPU/RAM/Disk does building qtwebengine take?
[05:48:22] <winny> lots :)
[05:49:23] <winny> my ryzen 5900x 12core takes about 38min, but on my amd fx 8350 it would take hours
[05:52:40] <winny> You may need to build more than qt5-qtwebengine, because it may want the same version of qt libs
[05:55:16] <winny> in your case i might be inclined to use the flatpak version or install nix, then get a newer qutebrowser setup from there.  Alpine packages both flatpak and nix
[05:56:00] <jtgd> Santa wants to upgrade my computer and I was looking at the Ryzen 5900. How do you like it? Does it seem the most cost effective?
[05:56:42] <winny> I can't say because I bought it at a markup when there was a shortage in ryzen cpus early this year
[05:56:51] <winny> I do enjoy it though :)
[05:57:43] <jtgd> thanks
[05:58:23] <jtgd> I think I will too. Current computer is 10 years old, i7-930 @ 2.8G

[06:01:40] <winny> that amd fx-8350 build died an partial death and was decommissioned for salvage, so I had to build my new PC sooner than I anticipated :o  Thankfully not a lot was marked up, just the CPU at that point.
