[00:07:15] <mdhughes> Technically it will work, but nobody* writes the last case that way, because then it doesn't expand to multiple statements.
[00:10:48] <pi0> oh shoot :/
[00:13:22] <pi0> hmm how would i end the condition?

[00:20:12] <gwatt> pi0: no, the "else" case has to be last.

[20:46:48] <Zipheir> What do people think about Hemann & Friedman's "Î»*" approach to curried procedure definitions?  http://www.schemeworkshop.org/2013/papers/HemannCurrying2013.pdf
[20:47:28] <Zipheir> Presumably the name lambda* clashes with a number of other extensions to lambda, but the design seems elegant.

[21:54:46] <gwatt> Zipheir: It's probably the best approach I've seen, but I'm unconvinced that a general purpose "always curry" is good.
[21:55:39] <gwatt> Indeed, near the end of the paper they provide some good arguments against currying for scheme

[22:00:07] <Zipheir> gwatt: Yes.
[22:01:58] <Zipheir> Lots of mistakes seem to be possible with Î»*, despite its usefulness.  I agree with them that a static type system makes auto-currying a lot more palatable.  Still, I think it's a useful tool to have available.
[22:03:20] <gwatt> I've found that most of the times I want currying or other partial application, I don't want it for all uses of the function, just specific ones.
[22:04:51] <Zipheir> It's funny to note that much of that paper is spent getting the nullary case right, but they conclude that "nullary Î»* functions seem to be of little to no value".
[22:05:45] <Zipheir> Indeed.  I often wonder why the ML-family functional languages switched from default-uncurried to default-curried; often the former is what you want.

[22:09:31] <gwatt> I know that in haskell currying is seemlessly provided. Do the proper ML's not do the same?
[22:10:18] <Zipheir> Er, I mean the popular idiom seems to have switched.  SML programs that I've seen tend to default to uncurried functions ((a, b) -> c instead of a -> b -> c).
[22:10:41] <leah2> not for ocaml or f# tho
[22:11:22] <Zipheir> Which is why I think the (older, presumably) functional idiom is different.
[22:11:58] <leah2> and sml curries implicitly too, just the stdlib doesnt use it. i think it's a misguided optimization but i'm not sure
[22:12:09] <Zipheir> I may be wrong; I haven't done enough archeology to back up that theory.
[22:12:47] <Zipheir> Probably an optimization.
[22:13:07] <Zipheir> Or rather an "optimization theory".
[22:13:08] <leah2> to me it sounds harder to optimize tuple allocation but what do i know :)

[22:31:27] <amazigh> leah2: why is misguided according to you?
[22:31:37] <amazigh> I read other say currying is difficult to optimize
[22:35:17] <Zipheir> Not having studied any clever strategies for implementing currying, it seems to me that it's a matter of efficiently implementing lambda.  Which is a critical goal for functional language implementations anyway.
[22:36:21] <gwatt> I suspect language implementors will also put in work to detect when they actually need to compile to curried calls.

[23:33:33] <Zipheir> I'm toying with writing a SRFI for Friedman & Hemann's currying form, but the name lambda* was taken by SRFI 89.  I'm not sure I like the name much, either.  Any suggestions?

[23:53:24] <mdhughes> cut/cute doesn't allow multiple parameters to be reordered, which makes it awkward to use in reality.
[23:53:48] <mdhughes> Hemann's device is equivalent to doing a letrec-over-lambda. We have that already.
[23:54:24] <dpk> well, we're unlikely to adopt SRFI 89 for R7RS. and anything we do adopt, we can rename
[23:54:47] <mdhughes> Just renaming 'lambda' to 'Î»' and having an easy way to type it (or using an easier-to-type char like 'l'), solves most of the curry problems.
[23:55:12] <dpk> \ isn't a valid symbol name in Scheme, is it?
[23:55:45] <dpk> hmm, Chibi's reader accepts it but its writer turns it into |\\|
[23:55:48] <mdhughes> I've played around with macroing let-over-lambda but I can't make a syntax for it that's obvious what it's doing.
[23:57:09] <dpk> yeah, Gerbil/Gambit and Chicken all do different things with a bare \. sigh
[23:58:07] <mdhughes> That's why I went with Î» and remapped my terminal and editor to type it on cmd-Y
[23:58:36] <mdhughes> I need to dig around in the OS keyboard mapper and set it there so it works in all text fields, but haven't bothered.
[23:59:03] <dpk> if the Mac had been designed by Lisp hackers, âŒ¥L would probably give us Î» instead of Â¬
[23:59:30] <mdhughes> Well, it kind of was, all text areas are emacs-lite.
