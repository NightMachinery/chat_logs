[01:04:09] <d_bot> <RegularSpatula> Has anyone noticed a lot of `Warning 6 [labels-omitted]` being trigged in their CI builds?  Cmdliner, topkg, etc are all getting them
[01:16:05] <d_bot> <RegularSpatula> Ah, I think this https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/10118 and this https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10140 explain it.  Previous CI runs had been on 4.12 but I had just started a new project CI and that was running 4.13, so Im assuming that's why I see the errors now and not before

[01:55:03] <d_bot> <Continuation Calculus> by chance, anyone knows how to tell dune to ignore some sub folders when doing `dune build src`?
[01:57:26] <d_bot> <monk> are you using the `include_subdirs` stanza?
[01:57:59] <d_bot> <monk> or are you talking about making dune skip subdirs that have their own dune stanzas
[01:59:16] <d_bot> <Continuation Calculus> the latter
[01:59:41] <d_bot> <Continuation Calculus> in my `src` folder, i have a lot of sub-folders, and i want to exclude a couple of them from `dune build src` or `dune runtest src`
[02:00:03] <d_bot> <Continuation Calculus> (not always, so I'd like to avoid having to edit their dune files whenever i want to toggle on-off this behavior)
[02:03:49] <d_bot> <monk> `--only-packages` flag *might* be the answer?
[02:05:12] <d_bot> <monk> i haven't hit this issue myself so i won't be of further use here ðŸ˜°

[10:07:41] <d_bot> <Sp4ce_Navigator> Im a JS/Pyrhon dev that *really* wants to finally learn functional programming. Im debating between Haskell and OCaml. If I'm going to invest a lot of time and energy into learning this language and new paradigm I want to make sure I choose correctly. I mainly do/intend to do backend web dev if that makes a difference. What would you all suggest?
[10:15:12] <d_bot> <monk> @Sp4ce_Navigator if you want a general introduction to FP (ie, from scratch introduction, no assumptions for both language and FP experience) with OCaml, nothing will probably beat the online hosted CS3110 course + video lectures
[10:16:43] <d_bot> <monk> it's a very nice online class that is basically an integrated online textbook with video lectures of code/materials combined in a jupyter-like workspace

[10:19:54] <d_bot> <monk> It also provides instructions for setting up your OCaml environment as used for the class ***and*** a virtual machine with OCaml setup in case you don't want to deal with that:

[13:53:52] <d_bot> <monk> as someone who actively chose ocaml over haskell despite previous exposure to haskell, i guess it goes without saying that ocaml is much smaller ecosystem/user-base wise than haskell. this passes on to documentation and tooling. that said, i think it is a pragmatic FP language with a lot less magic (okay, it's not magic, it's not having to pull in a dozen extensions that you don't understand as compared to a few basic ppx's at worst
[13:53:58] <d_bot> <monk> i also think the compile times are very nice!
[13:54:55] <d_bot> <monk> i know a lot of people who love haskell. if you want an intro to FP from haskell, i made it about halfway through haskellbook.com and can recommend it as very solid.
[13:55:22] <d_bot> <monk> as beginner/from scratch material, cc: Sp4ce_Navigator
[13:56:56] <d_bot> <monk> the authors go out of their way to avoid the weird/painful aspects of haskell, like (at the time of publishing) its confusing build tooling.
[14:02:53] <ns12> What are these Haskell "extensions"? Is it https://wiki.haskell.org/Language_extensions ?
[14:03:26] <d_bot> <monk> yeah
[14:04:08] <d_bot> <monk> `{#- LANGUAGE THING OTHER_THING -#}` is the general format i think
[14:04:28] <d_bot> <monk> lol i got the pound and dash sign reversed, `{-# LANGUAGE <Extension>, <Extension> #-} `
[14:05:17] <ns12> Why don't they write code in pure Haskell 98 or Haskell 2010? In OCaml, I can program without using any ppx.
[14:06:47] <d_bot> <monk> i am going to guess they have very good reasons but i do agree that you can go pretty far without ppx's in ocaml whereas lang extensions in haskell are pretty ubiquitous ime
[14:07:29] <d_bot> <monk> i honestly think compile time/resources is actually underrated imo
[14:08:26] <d_bot> <monk> i have yet to compile an ocaml program that OOM'd my computer. I did this more than once by accident with haskell after > 30min of compiling lol.
[14:08:47] <d_bot> <monk> miss type classes tho
[14:09:06] <humasect> yeah... but modules though =)
[14:28:01] <d_bot> <PureFunctor> Compile times are definitely a breath of fresh air, coming from Haskell

[23:11:19] <d_bot> <monk> neat-o
[23:12:13] <d_bot> <monk> is it considered good practice to install utop on its own switch?
[23:12:17] <d_bot> <monk> doing so would probably require exporting an env (or creating a bash alias?) to specify which one to use at that point, right?

[23:18:55] <d_bot> <VPhantom> There's talk of something coming up on the `v3.ocaml.org` site soon but I don't think it'll be a comprehensive postings thing, more of a wiki page to list positions we know of.
[23:24:29] <d_bot> <VPhantom> A "Jobs" category (covering anything from one-time bounties to full-time positions) on `discuss.ocaml.org` could be nice. I was surprised there wasn't already one.
[23:25:01] <d_bot> <monk> yeah i gaslit myself into thinking one existed and was momentarily confused haha
[23:26:18] <d_bot> <VPhantom> What would be the benefit?
[23:26:44] <d_bot> <VPhantom> (Sorry I forgot about the IRC proxy and used the "reply" feature.)
[23:27:53] <d_bot> <monk> i think a weekly/monthly posting in a similar vein of what you see on hackernews (forgive me for invoking the orange website) would be a good compromise if someone/entity could be put in charge of it. could be less of an overall liability than a static page since any given listing is liable to become out of date.
[23:28:44] <d_bot> <monk> re: switch, isolating utop entirely from any other version of ocaml used for a project and its installed packages
[23:28:56] <d_bot> <VPhantom> (Ah there's a Jobs _tag_ on Discuss, just not a root category as far as I can tell. I stand corrected.)
[23:29:37] <d_bot> <VPhantom> Yeah I'm not sold on the wiki page idea either; I like that the forums have a tag. It's a good start.
[23:30:33] <d_bot> <monk> i haven't used python seriously in years but i am finally getting around to regularizing my ocaml workflow and despite not being 1:1, the pain of bad python installs and package version mismatches has me asking questions i probably don't need to worry about for my scale of development lol
[23:30:41] <d_bot> <VPhantom> On `utop`, as far as I know it doesn't load any libraries by default (unlike `dune utop`) so I'm not sure a distinct switch with the same compiler version would be useful.
[23:30:52] <d_bot> <monk> yeah i think this is probably a better approach than a static page
[23:31:36] <d_bot> <VPhantom> Ah yes, pip, poetry, virtualenv, venv, etc. I had to dabble in Python and I came out unimpressed. Long live static, easy to share binaries.
[23:32:12] <d_bot> <monk> alerting & coordinating people to post on a pinned job listing every once in awhile, ie the hackernews approach, would probably go a long way
[23:32:28] <d_bot> <monk> and limits the effort to someone making the top level posting every X interval of time
[23:32:49] <d_bot> <VPhantom> The Jobs tag does it decently: <https://discuss.ocaml.org/c/community/jobs/14>
[23:33:30] <d_bot> <VPhantom> I'm not sure threads are removed when positions are filled, however. ðŸ˜•
[23:34:42] <d_bot> <monk> yeah, they should only be closed to comments at most
[23:34:59] <d_bot> <monk> still serve a good historical archive of places that /did/ hire OCaml and might in the future etc
[23:56:44] <d_bot> <monk> reconfiguring emacs to use lsp, isolated version of ocamlformat, and trying to leverage local opam switches on a per-project basis to make working on more complicated projects less messy. about to find out if i have any clue what i'm actually doing lol.
