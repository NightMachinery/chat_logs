[00:53:44] <dale> mattf: I think you probably want to set a 'keymap text property on the image with a keymap that binds RET to whatever function you want RET to run.  Example at https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Clickable-Text.html for mouse clicks.
[00:54:39] <mattf> No i dont want mouse clicks. I want a buffer that has the image only

[03:45:22] <alphapapa[m]> grym: My point is that individual package repos may disappear at any time.  Issues are regularly filed on MELPA's tracker about repos going missing or abandoned.  You never know when some *Hub is going to get bought out and boycotted.  And then if you have a bunch of packages pointing at those repo URLs, and they're gone one day when you need to reinstall something, you have to go hunt down the new places and change the URLs.  And that's if
[03:45:22] <alphapapa[m]> the authors didn't just go dark because they lost interest in maintaining some random package you use.  So that's the benefit of using centralized repos as middlemen/brokers.  It's not much different than getting packages from Debian repos instead of from SourceForge or GitHub, etc.
[03:45:41] <grym> (who are we kidding, they probably still on 4.cx

[04:37:16] <corwin> as a volunteer I'm able to vouch for projects as being good FOSS denizens; an app on behalf of MELPA would be welcome to use my name. 
[04:37:18] <alphapapa[m]> Anyway, who cares about GitHub.  I'm no MS fan--I can't stand the company, and haven't for a very long time--but GitHub is just another git host platform.  The primary benefit is the network effects, which are valuable.  Someday, things will change, as they always do, and I imagine MELPA will end up moving, as well as many other projects.  SF used to be the FOSS host, then it was GitHub, now things are shifting to GitLab and sr.ht, and then
[04:37:18] <alphapapa[m]> in a few more years it will be something else.  It's all ephemeral.  The repos themselves are not.

[04:39:17] <alphapapa[m]> corwin: So if MELPA ran its tracker on fosshost (I don't know what that is), but applications are not open, that means that people who want to submit their packages to MELPA would have to host their repos elsewhere, correct?  If so, yes, of course some do that already, but in the package review process, having both MELPA's repo, its tracker, and the submitted package's repo all on GitHub is /very/ helpful to the review process.  Throwing
[04:39:17] <alphapapa[m]> that away would do nothing but make MELPA maintainers' jobs harder.

[04:40:31] <corwin> Offhand, I might suggest/suspect we could provide a x86 VM with IPv4 and two AARCH64 nodes in US/UK.  If things that are easy to mirror run on AARCH that should make things fairly robust (without AWS bills).  Maybe ask also for PacketFrame for DNS/CDN in front of the website?

[04:41:25] <alphapapa[m]> I don't really think the fear of M$ owning GH is warranted.  M$ has done a lot of nasty things, and EEE is a serious concern, where it applies.  But it's not as if M$ bought git itself and is forking it with a proprietary license to EEE it and make GH-exclusive git features.  (If that ever happens, then I'll be the first-next to depart GH myself.)
[04:41:56] <corwin> alphapapa[m]: it's just a VM, mostly that we offer.  or a panel to create VMs in the case of AARCH64.  This would be a way to host, e.g. gitlab or sr.ht and whatever infra melpa would want to "self-host".  Nothing to do with how MELPA works.  Just free compute, if you want to look at it that way.
[04:42:25] <alphapapa[m]> corwin: Interesting.  How much space and bandwidth?
[04:43:13] <corwin> we generally get >= 10GB commit space varies based on need.  I seen people quite quite large hunks of disc, even SSD, for good reasons.
[04:44:20] <alphapapa[m]> corwin: I guess that might be enough for MELPA, but the site itself uses more storage than just the git repo, so I don't know if it would be.  Anyway, I don't think they want to adminstrate more services than they already do.  Having to host the repo and tracker itself would be an additional burden.

[04:48:24] <corwin> that's often the case.  moreover, if they don't actually need stuff (e.g. can already get what they need for free) obviously we'd prefer to give the resources to someone who can't

[04:50:20] <corwin> the 10GB is bandwidth.  I would expect 10-200gb of disk if you don't need SSD.  SSD is x86 only so far and appointed by a formula against cores that probably needs some looking into.

[04:52:09] <alphapapa[m]> um, 10 GB of bandwidth... LOL I don't think that would be enough =)
[04:53:44] <alphapapa[m]> I mean, I could be wrong... Elisp packages aren't that big... but I have noticed that a few of my packages inexplicably get thousands of clones every week, which I can only conclude comes from some kind of CI running who-knows-where, and I guess that MELPA has to absorb that kind of usage as well

[10:29:06] <himesama> but maybe not
[10:29:17] <himesama> what are the chances that an upgrade to buster could add 1G+?  i could move root to a larger partition but there is risk in that.  currently /dev/mapper/root      9.5G  7.2G  1.9G  80% / with 1G swap file there.

[10:39:59] <wibe> to work in and around emacs i set a goal to learn lisp. now i am not sure if i should go with elisp or clisp. what are your recommendations and why
[10:41:19] <empwilli> For myself I found it more easy to start out with clisp (though it's a different language in parts)
[10:41:51] <empwilli> the reason being that I found it simpler to do small projects in clisp than in elisp; the next step was to transfer that knowledge
[10:41:57] <empwilli> however I'm by no means an expert
[10:43:01] <himesama> wibe: they are both good.  emacs gives instant gratification.  it isi your goal so you probably have stuff you want it to do.
[10:44:42] <himesama> the languages are not too different, but thereis probably no need to learn both if your goal is elisp
[10:45:16] <himesama> but if you use elisp go ahed and oload the cl library.  it has lots of cl functions and macros
[10:45:33] <himesama> and it has its own info page i think maybe
[10:45:46] <himesama> yes, it does
[10:45:52] <wibe> i was worried about the missing closure in elisp
[10:46:24] <himesama> your information is many years out of date
[10:46:54] <wibe> it is, i only found a comparison from so over 9 years old
[10:46:57] <himesama> just put ;;; -*- lexical-binding: t -*- at the top of each fil

[20:13:04] <acdw> i'm actually curious (to change subjects slightly): whence the &word syntax?
[20:13:13] <acdw> like where's that defined? can one define more? etc
[20:13:29] <bpalmer> you mean like &optional  &keyword   and so on?
[20:13:32] <acdw> yeah
[20:13:42] <acdw> :keyword is explained places, so that i get
[20:13:50] <acdw> but the & syntax isn't so far as i can see
[20:14:06] <bpalmer> you can define your own if you write your own wrapper around defun (or lambda), etc; just accept &rest r and then parse the arguments yourself.
[20:14:21] <acdw> ohhh
[20:14:25] <bpalmer> &foo  is only special inside of defun, defun*, cl-defun and so forth
[20:14:32] <acdw> so is it just a "fancy" keyword?
[20:14:34] <bpalmer> yep.
[20:14:48] <acdw> huh. wonder why it's a separate syntax
[20:14:52] <bpalmer> I don't know the precise history of it, but I'd probably bet on it coming from maclisp
[20:15:05] <bpalmer> if I had to.

[23:41:14] <FrostyX> Hello guys, when I try to install a (magit) forge package using quelpa (like this https://paste.centos.org/view/d9560acf ), I get "quelpa-build--build-single-file-package: Single file forge-pkg.el does not match package name forge" 
[23:41:19] <FrostyX> Any idea what is wrong?
