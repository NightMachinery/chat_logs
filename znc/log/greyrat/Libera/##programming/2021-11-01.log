[00:01:25] <kveroneau> I've seen a few videos on YouTube on the subject, but didn't watch any yet.  Looks like it could be an interesting project.  I'm more of a software guy, and have created the 6502 in software many times though.

[00:08:50] <kveroneau> I actually tried Debian Woody at the time, but struggled to get my ATI Rage 128 Video card to properly work, and also had issues with my CD burner, being unable to burn, so I ended up using OpenBSD for several years before actually moving to GNU/Linux.
[00:09:55] <edgar-rft> an OS that isn't capable to burn the CD burner is worth nothing :-)
[00:10:01] <kveroneau> I later found out that in Kernel 2.4, I needed to load in a special module to translate IDE CD calls into SCSI calls, I believe it was called ide2scsi or something like that, which enables burning applications to actually run under Linux.  OpenBSD never had that issue.
[00:10:45] <kveroneau> Rather it was the other way around, translate SCSI calls to IDE calls.  Not really sure how that kernel module even worked tbh
[00:13:04] <kveroneau> There's even a question on a Linux exam here about it:  https://www.exam4training.com/considering-that-a-2-4-series-linux-kernel-is-being-used-which-kernel-module-must-be-loaded-to-enable-cd-burning-with-an-ide-cd-writer/

[00:20:42] <Gamara> or sliding window problem

[01:20:19] <InPhase> juliaEnv: I will add that over a career of decades, I've experienced a 0% failure rate of projects from software issues.  I've also been brought onto failing projects to fix them, with one notable one devotedly following Scrum practices when I arrived, which I quickly abandoned.  Success in software does not source from process protocols, it sources from robust engineering, which can be inserted 
[01:20:25] <InPhase> iteratively in a goal-oriented rapid-feedback stakeholder-focused manner.  Following those principles over others is a decent part of why my professional software projects have never failed.
[01:22:20] <LiaoTao> Does that apply even with the original definition of failure as stipulated in the very first study quoted? I.e. over time, over budget and what have you.

[01:23:39] <InPhase> LiaoTao: I've experienced many software projects which adjusted deadlines under adjustment of priorities and scope.  But that's fine.  That's renegotiation of timelines which count as success in order to achieve different things learned over the agile process.
[01:24:15] <LiaoTao> That would be my definition too, but maybe sticklers wouldn't accept that 100%?
[01:24:15] <InPhase> Stakeholders frequently change their minds and learn things when they see the early work, which is the point of this process.
[01:24:33] <InPhase> It's intentional and working as designed when that happens.

[01:41:30] <Gamara> my brain is just mush I think
[01:41:40] <pyzozord> I know that feeling very well
[01:41:49] <InPhase> You want to avoid death by N factorial cuts.
[01:41:50] <pyzozord> I need to get back to leetcode
[01:42:28] <Gamara> I need to start leet code, but I actually want to code stuff that is tangiable
[01:42:46] <Gamara> leet code problems take forever when you first start ;_;
[01:43:08] <pyzozord> form my experience the actual skill for the job and leetcode don't have a lot of overlap
[01:43:33] <pyzozord> and if you need to choose between the two, it's better to chose the actual skill of programming on the job
[01:43:51] <pyzozord> however once you have that skill, the leetcode skill will really make you stand out on the interviews
[01:44:20] <InPhase> pyzozord: Landing you a position where everyone's skill is focused on leetcode problems instead of real problems?  :)
[01:44:55] <Gamara> I think I am just going to learn blockchain coding instead of doing leet code
[01:45:07] <pyzozord> nah, from my experience, even if there are those kinds of questions during the interview, they that's never necessary in practice
[01:45:23] <pyzozord> it's kind of just arbitrary sieve to reduce a number of applicants
[01:46:03] <pyzozord> it's not leet code, as far as I studied it, it's really math puzzles that are killing you Gamara
[01:46:39] <Gamara> yeah you are right pyzozord, I have a degree in applied math too lol
[01:46:46] <Gamara> not that degrees are worth much these days
[01:46:49] <pyzozord> it's a very specific and "mathematical" way of thinking and solving problems, and it's very tough. Although you do get better as you practice it. But it's tough as hell
[01:47:21] <pyzozord> mathematicians say that that this feeling, of grinding your teeth with sweat and tears, that's a good feeling
[01:47:25] <pyzozord> they learn to like it
[01:47:48] <pyzozord> they say that's how you know you are really learning
[01:48:18] <Gamara> So here is my thoughts how to solve that prime number problem, recursivly create all substrings (unless prime is found or it has already been visited), then after that just do a string matching algorithm to figure out what primes go where
[01:48:26] <pyzozord> oh you have a degree in math? then I don't think I can say anything you don't know already

[01:49:30] <InPhase> The problems can take about 2 minutes.

[01:51:01] <apotheon> Yeah, FizzBuzz is a "good" way to weed people out.  You just have to schedule a first-step interview with twenty people within a two-hour period.  First step, have them all work on FizzBuzz.  Next step, send everyone home who sucks at that.  Third step, interview the two remaining applicants.

[03:37:23] <juliaEnv> importantly, InPhase is again mixing concepts 00:55:07. He is mixing Agile (which is about involving the user and keeping the customer happy with frequent releases of working software without any deadline), plan-driven (which is about time and budget and scope, or simply about a plan) and software engineering (which can be used to succeed both in Agile and in plan-driven projects.)
[03:38:11] <juliaEnv> in Agile, there is a timebox for every release, and a timebox is when the release goes out regardless of how many stories have been implemented
[03:38:38] <juliaEnv> in plan-based projects, there is a fixed budget, fixed time, and a fixed scope. They need to be on time and on budget and within specification.
[03:39:49] <juliaEnv> software engineering is all about approaches. Approaches are methods/processes/sets of steps to solve a problem systematically, in a disciplined way, and they are quantifiable meaning measurable processes
[03:40:14] <juliaEnv> an example of a software engineering approach is requirements engineering
[03:40:18] <InPhase> juliaEnv: It seems like a fine course textbook.  Although it looks like the meat of software engineering doesn't appear until Chapter 6, although the scope is fairly thin with a few examples.  Chapters 10-14 are important engineering topics, as is Chapter 16.  Chapter 19 on Systems engineering seems to have a good scope.  I've had to do a lot of Systems Engineering, and I appreciate this being in 
[03:40:24] <InPhase> such a textbook.  Since you seem to only recognize this book as an authority, let me at least highlight these chapters as being some of the core "engineering" parts of software engineering, rather than the project management processes.
[03:40:49] <juliaEnv> I've mentioned the IEEE as an authority as well

[04:19:09] <juliaEnv> InPhase OK
[04:20:21] <InPhase> juliaEnv: Which, to be clear, I looked up long ago while trying to evaluate the merits of pair programming.
[04:20:41] <juliaEnv> InPhase it's from 2009 and their method says "We did not assess the quality of the included studies in terms of, e.g., the appropriateness of the chosen effect size measures [30], the appropriateness of randomization procedures [31], subject/task selection and validity issues [46], statistical power [17], the use of theory [25], the approach to realism [24], etc." which threatens validity

[04:23:01] <juliaEnv> meta-analysis is not the best research method for that research question
[04:23:23] <juliaEnv> what I propose is to generate primary data experimentally in your actual environemnt which is way more valid

[04:23:56] <juliaEnv> they are both scientific methods, but each has a different validity and in this case what I suggest is fit for purpose

[04:37:08] <flakland> spec.
[04:37:09] <oldlaptop> the best and most successful standards tend to be those that defer to what people actually do in practice
[04:37:47] <apotheon> so . . . the opposite of something like the XDG BDS.
[04:37:56] <oldlaptop> see also POSIX (which has its problems like everything, but also has the shining virtue that it mostly ratifies existing practice - let's forget pax for now)
[04:37:58] <apotheon> s/^s/S/
[04:38:12] <bugweiser> IEEE 754-2008 defines five rounding modes
[04:38:25] <flakland> it does
[04:38:30] <flakland> one of whic is the actual mode
[04:38:45] <flakland> it's not predictible
[04:38:52] <bugweiser> the default or the one you selected
[04:38:53] <flakland> you have to test the implementation
[04:40:11] <flakland> it's a weak spec, they almost got it right though
[04:40:46] <flakland> all they had to do was let the program set the mode, or pick one mode
[04:40:57] <flakland> not cater to everyones opinion in the industry
[04:42:38] <bugweiser> The first three of the IEEE rounding modes can be specified in the instruction. The last mode, rounding toward plus infinity, can be obtained by setting the floating-point control register (FPCR) to select it and then specifying dynamic rounding mode in the instruction.
[04:42:48] <bugweiser> Dynamic rounding mode uses the IEEE rounding mode selected by the FPCR and is described in Section 4.1.2. Dynamic rounding can be used with any of the IEEE rounding modes.

[04:43:29] <bugweiser> they picked one mode, that's the default.
[04:43:51] <bugweiser> you can't properly do without rounding modes. not on that (market)scale
[04:44:05] <flakland> explain to me how i do this  using SSE
[04:44:21] <flakland> i must have missed that entry of the manual
[04:44:55] <flakland> is this the x87 processor?
[04:45:18] <bugweiser> I'm only expert in javascript other than that I sometimes dabble in assembly.  I guess the instructions above should be correct.. you encode it in the instruction.
[04:46:30] <bugweiser> I do know some instructions are expensive cause they toggle roundingmode and that is expensive.
[04:46:59] <bugweiser> anywho, please continue your discussion, I felt that float was worth while
[04:47:13] <flakland> float was almost good
[04:47:17] <flakland> i agree with that

[08:50:19] <mishugana> vdamewood: How do you mean?
[08:50:42] <mishugana> The reader is Acrobat Reader, and the full-fledged one is Acrobat Reader Pro?
[08:51:00] <vdamewood> mishugana: No. The ful-fledges one is Just 'Acrobat'.
[08:51:11] <vdamewood> There' Acrobat Standard, and Acrobat Pro.
[08:51:14] <vdamewood> There's
[08:51:51] <vdamewood> Acrobat Standard is only available for Windows, while Acrobat Pro is available for macOS and Windows. Pro comes with a few extra features, but both Standard and Pro can make PDFs.
[08:52:03] <mishugana> Checking on the adobe site, we seem to have "Acrobat Standard DC", "Acrobat Pro DC". More confusion.
[08:52:31] <vdamewood> Acrobat Reader just displays PDFs, and allows a user to fill out PDF forms.
[08:53:06] <vdamewood> The DC editions are the subscription version, like Creative Cloud (DC is for 'Document Cloud').

[08:54:59] <mishugana> Or at least it used to. :|
[08:55:10] <apotheon> Zathura doesn't have that as far as I'm aware, but if I specify a file I already had open before it remembers where I was.
[08:55:15] <vdamewood> I never really use PDFs in such a workflow, so I wouldn't notice such a feature.
[08:55:26] <mishugana> Used to be buggy, but at least used to work, and it was convenient for opening a bunch of docs that you were working on together.
[08:55:42] <apotheon> (it doesn't automatically open the same files, I mean)
[08:56:04] <mishugana> At this rate, I might as well use the built-in Preview tool, which is super lightweight compared to the bloatware that acrobat is 
[08:56:07] <vdamewood> In fact, the only feature Acrobat Reader has that I use that Preview doesn't is the ability to show the fonts used in a PDF document.

[08:59:24] <apotheon> I like the keybindings.  I never have to use a mouse with Zathura.
[08:59:30] <apotheon> It's fairly configurable, too.

[12:46:04] <pyzozord> I guess kind of depends on context. What will be the patterns of retriving the information?

[12:49:57] <Photic> I guess the pattern would be pretty much like reading a book, you check the table of contents and then get stuff related to the chapter you're interested in
[12:51:03] <pyzozord> books also have indexes which are pretty cool

[12:54:28] <mrig> Joanna: A modicum of civility in this crazy world, helps it to rotate just a little more smoothly ... It will turn none the less, but heck why not I say so long as we are on it for the ride? :)
[12:55:25] <mrig> Photic sound like some fun decisions to be making.
[12:55:54] <mrig> Seems that some prefer to define and outline before starting, others prefer to let the form emerge.
[12:56:52] * mrig shifts about a bit, today I will be mostly shifting bits ...
[12:56:56] <LiaoTao> Photic, Just go with a hash table and stop fretting. You can optimize it later for speed or size if it ever becomes a problem.
[12:57:38] <LiaoTao> (Unless you want incremental search, but from your description it does not look that way)
[12:58:17] <Photic> Makes sense
[12:58:58] <Photic> What would the solution look like for incremental search? Assuming content may be added afterwards in between
[12:59:38] <LiaoTao> What i mean by incremental search is that you want to be able to find a given element by a prefix (or other substring) of its key
[12:59:51] <LiaoTao> Incrementally adding elements would be the same as adding them in the first place
[13:00:13] <LiaoTao> As long as you have a reasonable key scheme you're good

[13:43:29] <CalimeroTeknik> mrig, not sage, just… the theoretical problems solved in the various kernels are the same
[13:44:16] <CalimeroTeknik> the kind of "sage" that you are bound to mean to talk about is on the emotional/sentimental level, but I'm highlighting the theoretical interest here
[13:45:34] <CalimeroTeknik> though it does have a direct effect: once you understand the design goals, your emotions stop being sucked into "I love/hate PE32 executables" and other irrational attachment to what are just standards

[13:46:39] <CalimeroTeknik> however, you can have taste, and prefer the standards that serve the design goals better, while fighting against the standards that don't, and joining forces to propose new ones
[13:47:07] <CalimeroTeknik> does that somehow clarify?
[13:47:23] *** Joins: cursey (~cursey@user/cursey)
[13:47:55] <CalimeroTeknik> contrast that with people who are simply used to a given system and prefer it out of habit
[13:48:34] <pikapika> CalimeroTeknik, convention has a lot of power
[13:48:47] <mrig> CalimeroTeknik nope, by sage I mean that sage understands the cause of emotions perfectly, those who do not have them are effectively blind; I don't know what sage means to you as such will I refrain from inferring anything.
[13:48:53] <pikapika> Convention allows you to not have to think/devote explicit computing power to a large amount of stuff
[13:49:05] <CalimeroTeknik> sure it does, that's why defective standards will still be in use once they become widespread: mass effect
[13:50:24] <mrig> understanding emotions without having them being the worst scenario, if the person is not particularly well brought up and educated, those people become monsters far to readily.
[13:50:36] <mrig> There are lots of code monsters our there
[13:51:01] <mrig> some in very high places too, due to widespread educational ignorance.
[13:51:20] <pikapika> CalimeroTeknik, I am saying there is legit power in convention
[13:51:35] <mrig> Clarification is always a good thing :)
[13:51:36] <pikapika> Not as in political power but also as in "technical" power
[13:51:56] *** Snake`s_Ghost is now known as snake
[13:52:13] <CalimeroTeknik> "convention"?
[13:52:31] <CalimeroTeknik> do you mean de facto (because has ended up being the first widespread thing) stuff?
[13:52:48] <Decker> defective standards = convention :)
[13:52:50] <CalimeroTeknik> or rather intentional conventions?
[13:52:52] <pikapika> Its more than that. Convention is also things like common expectations regarding the format of command line programs and so on
[13:53:47] *** Quits: ExeciN (~ExeciN@user/nicexe) (Remote host closed the connection)
[13:53:47] <mrig> power is an objective way to describe a gradient, to speak of this as a flow seems more sane to me somehow.
[13:53:51] <CalimeroTeknik> I see three aspects to "conventional": 1. accidental (de facto); 2. intentional; 3. statu quo (habits)
[13:53:59] <CalimeroTeknik> which do you mean?
[13:54:04] <mrig> the reality is the vector not the value.
[13:54:13] <CalimeroTeknik> (multiple answers possible)
[13:54:22] <pikapika> CalimeroTeknik, the cause behind the convention is not as relevant
[13:54:32] <pikapika> Its the existence of it that I was talking about
[13:54:35] <CalimeroTeknik> but what is a convention?
[13:54:47] *** Quits: DevAntoine (~DevAntoin@2a01:e34:ec4e:a200:f885:1855:6fd4:8510) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[13:54:54] <Decker> the defacto standard probably applies 
[13:55:01] <pikapika> Convention is why you can without thinking type cmd --help to get the help of a command and learn its options quickly
[13:55:11] <Decker> cmd /?
[13:55:19] <pikapika> that too is a convention
[13:55:19] <Decker> cmd
[13:55:24] <pikapika> it was just an example
[13:55:45] <pikapika> Convention frees the mind from thinking, without any cost
[13:55:58] <pikapika> other than issues of possible rigidity
[13:56:08] <CalimeroTeknik> pikapika, I'll try another angle to understand what you said: what is "legit power"?
[13:56:12] <CalimeroTeknik> especially the "legit" part
[13:56:15] <Decker> so it's something like muscle memory

[13:56:20] *** Joins: AMG (ghebo@user/amg)
[13:56:23] <CalimeroTeknik> "there is power in convention", alright, sure, but "legit"?
[13:56:34] <CalimeroTeknik> "muscle memory" → habits, point 3
[13:56:56] <pikapika> CalimeroTeknik, power as in it enables us to do things that were not possible. Its freeing up mind and computer resources from things, which can be then applied to higher ends.
[13:57:38] <CalimeroTeknik> so you mean leveraging the multiplying factor on the cost-effectiveness of people's habits, yes
[13:58:06] <CalimeroTeknik> instead of being minimal, leveraging what's efficient, regardless of whether it's the most effective way
[13:58:24] <CalimeroTeknik> the path of least resistance, all in all
[13:58:29] <pikapika> Yeah, just having a convention frees up resources from being spent
[13:58:40] <pikapika> its not necessarily a path of least resistance
[13:59:12] <pikapika> Its more like, say, we can have an english and a french speaking with each other through a translator; but if both choose a common tongue it makes it efficient
[13:59:49] <pikapika> or in the other case I mentioned, we can get ahead with higher and complex tasks wthiout having to worry about certain matters because convention freed us from thinking
[13:59:53] <CalimeroTeknik> mrig, about the 'sage' definition, I agree with your reasoning, but I think that you described 'knowing the path'; 'walking the path' is simply achieved by (and it can be accidental), making the causes of emotions irrelevant (like OS usage habits) because you're interested in something else (like algorithms)
[14:00:23] <CalimeroTeknik> so you can be a sage without what you said, but you can't know what a sage is without it!
[14:00:26] <mrig> Standards are a great thing and so is growth and new ideas, maintaining growth in a sustainable way is and art.
[14:00:30] <mrig> an art rather.

[14:01:27] <mrig> art in some context really is meaningless, so I do hesitate to use the word currently.
[14:01:42] <CalimeroTeknik> you could use 'organic life'
[14:01:55] <mrig> yes very organic.
[14:02:08] <CalimeroTeknik> which not only needs a design, but also an evolvable way there where each step of the way is viable
[14:03:15] <CalimeroTeknik> and so, organic stuff that evolved to where it is is frustrating to theorists, because it will not match their model (so you can see organically evolved systems as 'defective' from the theoretical view)
[14:03:31] <mrig> I think that the 'path' that you mention, is an emergent property and not something that can be wilfully defined.
[14:04:15] <CalimeroTeknik> you were the one to consciously put it in words, that's funny!

[14:49:04] <mrig> oh jovian types can be a nightmare when they are poorly educated, for the more sensitive amongst us.
[14:49:17] <pikapika> We often "discover" math but when we have a computer system we can already nicely control, trying to "discover" axioms from which your program logic emerges can lead to trouble. Mainly that its rigid and small changes can lead to large effects. When we can directly control the program at a fine level, it is safer to go with that.
[14:49:47] <mrig> you just have to show them where the limits are though to solve that, being insensitive they are not able to detect them, themselves.
