[03:00:24] <shrysr> Hmm on github as well. https://github.com/emacsorphanage/yaoddmuse
[03:01:24] <e1f> they should have called it yodamuse

[03:14:48] <shrysr> corwin: yea. infact i think somewhere kensanata mentions that he prefers using Anon to encourage participation on the wiki
[03:15:11] *** Joins: AimHere (~David@92.238.16.159)
[03:15:20] <shrysr> corwin: there is ox-oddmuse iirc. I tend to use it on occassion. I think it works for basic exports.
[03:15:39] <corwin> making it use files and a git commit process to update makes it really easy to ensure I can do my typing in Emacs.
[03:16:16] <corwin> I mean, not anything special to do in terms of my Emacs setup at all in that case.
[03:16:46] <shrysr> hmm. Yea. But i suppose the git based flow would not allow editing on the web interface?
[03:16:53] <corwin> And I assume this would be an equal status, e.g. for anyone using a different editor.
[03:17:07] <shrysr> or amiwrong
[03:17:34] <corwin> shrysr: I guess it wouldn't be hard to implement a CGI like front-end for that, but no, I don't think it has any web based editing UX by default.

[10:39:03] <codingquark> (did it with Wolfram BTW)
[10:39:31] <bpalmer> codingquark: there are some public health/safety arguments for avoiding time shifts. In the US, there's apparently a measurable increase in accidents the day after time falls back (that is, people who stick to a 9-5 schedule and go to sleep at the same nominal time get one hour less sleep)
[10:40:05] <codingquark> Hmm, I am able to understand that reasoning
[10:40:49] <bpalmer> You'd get the exact same issue if a business sent out a memo saying, "Starting tomorrow we will expect you to work 8-4 instead of 9-5," but people assume businesses won't do that.
