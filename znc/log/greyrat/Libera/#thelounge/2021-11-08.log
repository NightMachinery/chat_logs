[11:33:29] <fnutt> What is the purpose of storing connection info in the browser in public mode?
[11:33:43] <fnutt> Would this allow for auto-reconnect in public mode?
[11:37:52] <johncs> None of the fields you enter at the beginning are currently remembered
[11:37:54] <johncs> might be nice to
[11:39:14] <fnutt> I think it would be good to have it configurable - as in, store the information or not.
[11:39:53] <fnutt> It's not always you would want to store the information.
[11:40:00] <kuroshi> could also make it offer to store on startup, and then on reload, offer to use stored info or discard it
[11:40:09] <johncs> i can imagine a public terminal not wanting to keep the info
[11:40:16] <johncs> do you have another scenario in mind?
[11:40:25] <fnutt> But please go on with it. 👍
[11:41:00] <kuroshi> maybe people living off a public instance from home instead of using their own instance
[11:41:00] <fnutt> Yes, or a scout event where the scouts uses the same pc to chat on a public The Lounge client.
[11:41:27] <kuroshi> highly modern compared to my scouting experience of the early 1990s
[11:41:31] <fnutt> Could just be a check-box.
[11:41:38] <fnutt> (as kuroshi suggested)
[11:41:59] <fnutt> kuroshi: https://webchat.scoutlink.net
[11:42:25] <kuroshi> I haven't been involved with the scout program since then, either
[11:42:55] <johncs> gotcha, so in this shared terminal situation, what is your concern around having the nick field auto-populated with the last user's nick?
[11:43:14] <johncs> oh wait, a NickServ password
[11:43:31] <johncs> didn't know that was shown on there
[11:43:35] <fnutt> It's just not the nickname I assume that would be stored.
[11:44:00] <johncs> i think just not saving the password will be the move there

[11:49:02] *** cnf1 is now known as cnf
[11:51:19] <johncs> is that lounge installation patched to include that nickserv field? I didn't realize that entry screen could be configured at all
[11:57:27] <bookworm> for the usecase in the original issue just saving the info on the main login screen might not be enough... You really want it to remember which networks you joined and preferably all channels too (that one znc does automatically, so only useful for real networks)
[11:58:07] <johncs> the main login screen normally has channels on it
[11:58:36] <johncs> I think that installation is patched to have a special main screen... though I'm suspicious I'm unfamiliar with some config options...
[11:59:23] <bookworm> sure, "initial channel" based on the default server config. Not sure if we should cram user joined channels there
[11:59:43] <johncs> oh of course, that makes sense
[11:59:50] <bookworm> (that would ignore the TL admin, which os bad)
[12:00:07] <johncs> what would ignore the TL admin?
[12:01:57] <bookworm> cramming user channels into the default channels upon connection
[12:02:34] <johncs> it's just for that user's computer, and they could've typed them in anyways, so that seems fine
[12:03:47] <johncs> but I think just saving what they type in and keeping it simple is probably fine for most cases. seems like the user can update their initial channels over time if they care to 🤷‍♀️
[12:03:54] <johncs> we're just tryna add a bit of convenience
[12:08:32] <bookworm> how would you handle multiple networks?
[12:08:51] <bookworm> defaults is just a single one iirc
[12:09:34] <bookworm> and unless you set locknetwork to true you can join others

[12:11:04] <johncs> I'm not sure I understand. The idea is just to preserve the values for all the fields (minus any passwordy ones) in the opening screen.
[12:11:31] <johncs> What handling for multiple networks are you imagining?
[12:12:10] <johncs> Or are you thinking of a post- #4299 world?

[12:12:53] <bookworm> well the original issue was "I want TL to quit when I disconnect TL and restore everything when I connect to TL" that was what started the whole discussion
[12:13:12] <bookworm> and ZNC needs one connection per network, same as a real IRC net
[12:13:36] <bookworm> your proposal just solves parts of the issue
[12:13:53] <bookworm> as in channels for a single network
[12:17:17] *** Quits: Myst (~Myst@user/myst) (Quit: Bye!)
[12:17:49] <johncs> ah I see. I think it'd be fine to allow multiple networks to be selected in 4299's implementation, which'd fold in nicely with this.

[12:20:05] <fnutt> Let's not make the start-screen overcomplicated, please.
[12:20:30] <fnutt> IRC still suffer from being a bit too technical and difficult to use, compared to e.g. Discord and Messenger.
[12:21:08] <johncs> 🤷‍♀️ I don't think that'd be a terribly difficult design challenge honestly. but yeah it wouldn't be worth doing if it comes with a bunch of downsides.
[12:21:28] <johncs> saving the fields seems generally good and helps the use-case of that issue decently

[12:37:17] <johncs> i definitely didn't appreciate the complexity of parsing markdown until i actually sat down to do it... seemed like such a nice simple language 😭
[12:38:59] <DeeJayy> :)
[12:59:04] <bookworm> considering it's IRC you can ignore anything that needs a newline, aka lists, paragraphs and such things
[12:59:28] <bookworm> you only need bold/italics etc, code and that's about it
[12:59:42] <johncs> yeah... that's why I thought it'd be easy 😭
[12:59:54] <johncs> it's truly not too bad, but it is weird in an interesting way
[13:00:02] <bookworm> how come?
[13:00:07] <johncs> Well ***hello* world** and ***hello** world* are both valid
[13:00:25] *** Joins: iXNyNe (~NyNe@user/nyne)
[13:00:40] <johncs> So when you encounter that first run of formatting characters, you're not sure whether they're opening formatting codes at all (because ***hello would also be valid)
[13:00:50] <bookworm> I see
[13:00:54] <johncs> But then you also don't know whether it's an opening ** and an opening * or an opening * and an opening **
[13:01:22] <johncs> at first I thought I'd have to do a bunch of backtracking. But the common mark spec said "we've devised things so you don't have to do any backtracking"
[13:02:08] <johncs> which I'm glad for. that kept me from going a way more complicated route than needed here. but it's definitely still been tricky.
