When someone presses a hand against the grill, they experience the illusion of burning heat. …)
[00:20:25] <feep> "The illusion is demonstrated by positioning the middle finger in cold water and the ring and index fingers in warm water.

[01:01:38] <saturn2> i don't like this meme
[01:01:42] <adiabatic> I forget which boxes are which
[01:01:56] <adiabatic> it needs a lot of workshopping
[01:02:33] <catern> adiabatic: you're right I should just say "taking one box"
[01:03:03] <catern> instead of "taking box B"; but you don't need to know which box is which to understand the meme as long as you know the solution
[01:03:10] <catern> saturn2: why not, is it not funny
[01:03:31] <adiabatic> _is_ "take both boxes" the solution?
[01:03:38] <catern> no... one-boxing is
[01:03:50] <adiabatic> told you I forgot
[01:04:19] <adiabatic> I have a couple VvC memes in the pipe but they're kind of shit still
[01:04:23] <saturn2> catern: tbh i found it more annoying than funny
[01:05:11] <catern> some people just don't appreciate good trolling
[01:06:09] <saturn2> probably mostly because you used the wrong font
[01:06:31] <catern> i don't know what impact is called on Linux
[01:07:21] <catern> don't even seem to have it installed
[01:07:37] <adiabatic> Impact is Microsoft-proprietary (or maybe just licensed by them).
[01:07:59] <catern> yuck, proprietary fonts? no thank you
[01:08:20] <catern> virgin Impact/chad Ubuntu Mono
[01:08:37] <adiabatic> try League Gothic
[01:08:59] <adiabatic> it's not Impact, but it's way less wrong
[01:09:25] <catern> well at least I'm not getting the meme format wrong like https://twitter.com/acidshill/status/1441870864056684544

[01:09:58] <mjr> yeah impact is proprietary. There are installers for impact and some other MS fonts for many linux distros though because they're IIRC okay download and install in their original packaging, or something to that effect. Thus you're not allowed to package them but you can make a package that downloads and installs them
[01:10:13] <mjr> But yeah if you want free fonts you'd find something else.
[01:10:21] <catern> I really like the "obsessed with money/rationality is its own reward" in my meme
[01:10:28] <catern> I thought that was quite funny
[01:10:43] <saturn2> that one's terrible too
[01:13:32] <saturn2> your chads aren't arrogant enough
[01:15:53] <catern> maybe you could suggest some lines?
[01:18:30] <saturn2> "understands causality" "punished for being rational, doesn't care" "laughs at superstition" "refuses to be blackmailed by the past"
[01:25:58] <two2thehead> feep, I can see why you like the _Tracks_ game. I'm reminded of OpenTTD
[01:26:34] <feep> ^^
[01:27:46] <feep> catern: what, chad is not supposed to be wrong
[01:29:04] <feep> well, the point is it doesn't matter if he's wrong, he's *confident*, so you can play the meme both ways

[01:53:24] <kuudes> predictions about a person are sort of sensitive given assassination market implications, so I do not want to be the one issuing the market I think

[01:54:15] <kuudes> yes, but that does not bring out the benefit for him
[01:54:45] <kuudes> as he has a lot of fans, he could indeed check from the prediction market, if he publishes his travel plans frequently, if risks spike
[01:54:58] <adiabatic> does he have that many nerdy fans
[01:54:58] <kuudes> and thereby alter his behaviour
[01:55:01] <kuudes> yes

[02:18:49] <catern> a magical genie who's super good at predicting human behavior, named YHWH, has set up two transparent boxes before you. transparent box 1 contains all the sinful pleasures of life on earth, which you can see look very fun; transparent box 2, YHWH says, contains one of two things: if YHWH predicted you would take only box 2, then it contains life in a universe where there is an eternity of heavenly reward after death which far surpass
[02:18:49] <catern> the pleasures of earth; if YHWH predicted you would take both box 1 and box 2, then box 2 contains life in a material universe where there is no afterlife. you can see, from looking in box 2, that you do seem to be living in a material universe with no god or afterlife
[02:18:59] <catern> do you take just box 1, or both box 1 and box 2?
[02:19:10] <catern> er, just box 2* or both box 1 and box 2
[02:21:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> err, what
[02:21:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is box 2 transparent or opaque?
[02:22:00] <catern> box 2 is transparent
[02:22:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean... ok
[02:22:27] <catern> ala https://arbital.com/p/transparent_newcombs_problem/
[02:22:28] <Robomot> GreaterWrong version of catern’s link: https://arbital.greaterwrong.com/p/transparent_newcombs_problem/
[02:22:28] <Robomot> Arbital (Omega has left behind a transparent Box A containing $1000, and a transparent Box B containing $1,000,000 or nothing.  Box B is full iff Omega thinks you one-box on seeing a full Box B.)
[02:22:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> So the contents of box 2 could change after your decision, is the point
[02:22:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> And/or, you don't *really* know what it contains
[02:22:54] <catern> no, they won't change
[02:23:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't get it.
[02:23:16] <catern> i mean it's just transparent newcomb's problem with a religious flavor :)
[02:23:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't think so...
[02:23:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> The way you've said it, it seems like a straightforward causal decision theory problem
[02:23:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you pick box 2 only, it will turn out that box 2 contains heaven
[02:24:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you pick both boxes, it will turn out that box 2 contains nothing
[02:24:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because YHWH will cause that to be the case, either way
[02:24:58] <feep> does the heavenly reward include sinful pleasures
[02:24:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is based on your formulation, which suggests that your perception of box 2's contents is not guaranteed veridical
[02:25:18] <catern> heh fair
[02:25:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> If your perception of box 2's contents IS guaranteed veridical, then... again there's nothing to talk about, box 2 is clearly empty, pick box 1, done
[02:26:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also the other problem is that unlike standard Newcomb's, there's no element of "the box contents definitely won't change now, Omega is gone and has no further interest in you"
[02:26:38] <catern> well, my intent is that it's guaranteed viridical - more specifically, that your perception of a material universe is exactly the perception you have right now today
[02:26:46] <catern> veridical even
[02:27:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, but then you also need some sort of guarantee (as, again, in standard Newcomb) that YHWH always tells the truth
[02:27:35] <catern> sure, that goes without saying
[02:27:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because in your formulation you just go "uh... ok YHWH so are you lying or what" and he goes "no, srs" and you go "no but I think you're lying though"
[02:27:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then what
[02:27:44] <catern> but yes, YHWH always tells the truth
[02:27:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> How can you know
[02:28:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not like you can observe the last 100 people having successfully gone on to an afterlife
[02:28:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And if you do, well, clearly you're *not* living in a material universe with no afterlife!)
[02:28:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Again we lack the standard Newcomb property of "it's totally possible for Bob over there to get a million bucks and for me to get zilch, this violates no laws and presents no problems"
[02:28:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not so in your variant!
[02:29:57] <catern> just as random flavor, this decision is being made at the beginning of time, as part of Protestant Christian God's predestination of whether everyone is going to heaven or hell :)
[02:30:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Man, I don't think that's even consistent with Christian doctrine, much less any decision theory

[02:33:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, if we're choosing at the end of time, then of course we one-box
[02:33:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> i.e., pick only box 1
[02:34:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> er, beginning of time
[02:35:00] <catern> although they didn't bring up the link to transparent newcomb's problem

[06:24:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> ivan: This person seems insane
[06:25:39] <namespace> Like Dan Carlin makes this claim in his Blueprint For Armageddon series that the French Revolutionary Wars basically ripped the bandaid off of feudalism by forcing every country to mass mobilize to defeat them.
[06:25:48] <namespace> And it seems reasonable enough, I believe Moldbug makes the same claim in his essays somewhere.
[06:26:17] <namespace> But, I'd like to know the details. Because I cite the concept in my next essay and the details are important, if nothing else so when I assert it I can be fairly certain I do in fact believe this is a thing that happened.
[06:26:39] <namespace> And when I try to look it up, I get Britannica articles that go into way way too much detail about things I don't really care about.
[06:26:47] <namespace> So is there anything that speaks to this particular thing really well?

[06:38:37] <namespace> This isn't hard.
[06:39:02] <gwern> or the meiji reforms... group selection. a lot of modernizing is driven by fear
[06:39:17] <gwern> it's the only way to get the entrenched elites and interest groups to give way
[06:40:09] <namespace> gwern: Definitely. In fact the specific thing I want to claim is that often people will claim that societal decline in the West causes X-Risk bla bla bla, but isn't it clearly the other way around? Like, nukes mean no more war means states and societies are allowed to become almost arbitrarily degenerate (see North Korea).

[06:40:53] <namespace> Huge armies are targets.
[06:41:16] <namespace> > if the entire reason why Republics exist basically is to have fine grained control over massive armies.
[06:41:26] <namespace> It's this part I want to know more about, because it seems frankly underanalyzed if it's the case.
[06:41:56] <namespace> "Huh, I can't imagine why everything starts to fall apart immediately after WW2. It's certainly not like my society lost its animating rationale to exist or anything."

[06:42:53] <namespace> Elites simply not caring as much about maintaining the quality of schools, or making sure they can draft many many troops at a moments notice, not practicing their ability to exert fine grained control over millions of men at once domestically...why bother?
[06:43:04] <namespace> That stuff is hard and you have hydrogen bombs anyway.
[06:43:07] <gwern> no need even for a draft
[06:43:11] <namespace> Yup.
[06:43:32] <gwern> although to be fair, I haven't noticed countries with drafts seeming all that more functional. russia, south korea...
[06:43:58] <namespace> gwern: Yeah, there's clearly other factors afoot. But then there's also massive stagnation in those countries.
[06:44:02] <gwern> it's more reverse-causality there: drafts used to be modernizing, now they show you're stuck in the past
[06:44:06] <namespace> Like, if Russia had to actually defend its territory.
[06:44:09] <namespace> Without resorting to nukes.
[06:44:10] <namespace> Could it?
[06:44:41] <gwern> putin hasn't shot all the generals, so have to figure he'd waste a year on that
[06:44:52] <namespace> Sure but you see my point?
[06:45:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Russia is already failing to actually defend its territory
[06:45:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right now, as we speak
[06:45:37] <namespace> touche
[06:46:18] <gwern> it is? I thought they took from georgia, the crimea as well, and the ukraine russian faction was still there. where are they failing to defend territory?

[06:48:18] <gwern> oh, that. how big a deal is that anyway? I mean, chinese demographics being what they are, it doesn't look like they're going to turn siberia into a hanthill, and I've never heard much about CCP exerting any kind of meaningful control or power within the russian borders
[06:48:57] <gwern> when I've read about the trade and emigration, it still always sounds like a "the bank owns you" scenario rather than "you own the bank"
[06:49:02] <namespace> Heh, I wonder if that's how DC thinks about the southern border.
[06:49:18] <Obormot\Gaia> gwern: Yes... for how long
[06:50:29] <gwern> well, that's why I mentioned the demographics. chinese people don't particularly want to go to sibera (shocku) and their population is very near the inflection - I think some reports have the chinese working population actually having just peaked for all time, and is now going to fall for the rest of the century
[06:51:03] <gwern> (and I specify working population because it's not like it's the grannies who are going to pick up sticks and go colonize siberia for make glory xi)
[06:53:15] <ggreer> holy cow holographic sights have gotten way better in the past decade. I remember a decade ago paying almost $600 for an eotech. it used two n-cell batteries and lasted maybe 50 hours. now I can get a micro red dot that lasts a year on a cr2016 battery... for $300. it's waterproof and automatically shuts off if it's sitting around
[06:53:29] <ggreer> it's probably less than 1/10th the mass of the eotech
[06:53:38] <gwern> why does it last only a year if it auto-offs?

[08:24:18] <rmmh> probably worse is sociopath / 85 iq
[08:24:26] <nshepperd2> yeah i think an 85 IQ person will have much more trouble taking care of themselves in an abusive situation than an average 16yo or minimum wage worker

[08:25:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: I agree but you know, lots of people are in abusive situations and are above-average IQ and doing dumb shit
[08:25:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Some of these replies are wtf
[08:25:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Interesting way to compare them is by combining them in opposition. For instance billionaire w/ 85 IQ dating a minimum wage worker w/ 150 IQ. Where does the power lie?" ... ah yes, an 85 IQ billionaire, of course
[08:25:33] <rmmh> many such cases!
[08:26:04] <rmmh> billionaires are just lucky and/or cruel, Obormot\Arcturus, they have no inherent qualities that earned them wealth
[08:26:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course
[08:26:59] <saturn2> i think billionaire/wagie is obviously the right answer
[08:27:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> See, that's what I said

[08:27:45] <Kol> what are common estimates of Trump's IQ?
[08:27:48] <rmmh> power imbalance to me is mostly how much leverage the powerful can exert on the weak when they try to leave

[08:28:06] <rmmh> Kol: it's not clear that he's even literate

[08:28:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> The money one is really the only case where you can, without great difficulty, engineer a situation where the less-powerful person will not even attempt to right any "unfairness" or "abuse" or w/e that exists in the relationship

[08:42:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> This group is not going to agree, no matter what. But I would, nonetheless, say that the _right_ thing to do, the _fair_ thing to do, is to give Dennis one-fifth of the pie—the other four combining to hold him off by force, if necessary, if he tries to take more."
[08:43:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> And I thought: no! The right and fair thing to do (especially if force turns out to be necessary) is to punish Dennis for trying to get the whole pie, by giving him nothing (or less than a fifth, anyhow)!

[08:52:37] <nshepperd2> 58°C
[08:52:47] <rmmh> did you blanch it

[08:53:27] <rmmh> err, 136F
[08:53:35] <nshepperd2> i seared it in a frypan afterward
[08:53:45] <quanticle> Huh, okay. A bit cooler than the temperature you use to sous vide chicken.
[08:53:46] <rmmh> high enough to gelatinize, not high enough to pasteurize
[08:53:59] <rmmh> I did a long cook near that temp and got lovely green steak

[08:57:29] <quanticle> Isn't anhedonia one of the main symptoms of chronic depression?
[08:58:16] <PapuaHardyNet> naw, I'm super productive, I'm not going through a depressive episode or chronically depressed - I have experience with both and I know that this isn't it
[08:58:22] <quanticle> Ah, okay
[08:58:45] <quanticle> Yes, "super productive" is definitely *not* something that I would associate with any of my episodes of depression
[08:59:22] <PapuaHardyNet> well, anhedonia *can* be a slippery slope to depression if one gets obsessed about it
[09:00:09] <PapuaHardyNet> how did you get through your depressive episodes anyway quant? I keep antidepressants ready in case I fall back in - I wonder what your weapons are
[09:00:52] <rmmh> nshepperd2: digging in again it looks like I'm  wrong about it being bacterial
[09:01:23] <quanticle> My depressive episodes were never really bad enough for me to have to seek antidepressants (other than the one time and the one other time). Usually I can wait it out. There was the one other time where I kiiiiiiinda got fired from a job because of it, but other than that, I've just struggled through
[09:02:12] <quanticle> rmmh: So when you said "green steak", you mean that it was *literally* green?

[09:05:15] <PapuaHardyNet> if you got fired from a job for it, then it was serious

[09:05:20] <nshepperd2> silly tech people with all their ridiculous acronyms
[09:05:36] <PapuaHardyNet> truth is, depressive episodes get consecutively worse
[09:05:59] <PapuaHardyNet> so you need to do your best to prevent that cycle from happening
[09:07:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> I still remember back in the olden times reading about how, on the West Coast, people pronounced "SCSI" as "sexy"
[09:07:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> And thinking "my god, those degenerates"
[09:07:54] <nshepperd2> rmmh: that's gotta be oxidation right? but looks kind of weird for it
[09:08:48] <nshepperd2> the correct pronunciation is "scuzzie", of course
[09:08:49] <rmmh> nshepperd2: random forum posts have various hypotheses but generally agree that it's some *chemical* shift
[09:08:59] <rmmh> ^
[09:09:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: Indeed
[09:10:17] <quanticle> I hadn't heard the "sexy" pronunciation of SCSI before just now, but let me play devil's advocate for a moment. Which would you rather have? A daisy-chain of "scuzzy" disks? Or a daisy chain of "sexy" disks?
[09:10:42] <quanticle> God, what even is a "scuzzy" disk? Sounds like something with mold growing on it.
[09:11:03] <nshepperd2> they go right next to the snazzy disks
[09:11:09] <quanticle> Just use PATA like a normal person.
[09:11:48] <quanticle> (Or rather, ATA, because I don't think SATA had been developed at that point, so there was no need to distinguish Parallel ATA from any other form of ATA)
[09:11:48] <saturn2> i would rather have scuzzy disks
[09:11:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Back in my day we didn't call it "PATA", which... exactly
[09:12:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Heck we didn't even call it ATA
[09:12:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> It was "IDE"
[09:12:20] <quanticle> Yeah
[09:12:54] <quanticle> "Why did Michael O. Church buy a SCSI controller?" "Because he hates IDEs"
[09:13:12] <nshepperd2> beware the IDEs of march, for they bring errors due to windows 98 being too retarded to understand a disk being swapped
[09:14:45] <quanticle> Another reason to prefer IDE: IDE used "master/slave" to distinguish drives on the same cable. So if you want to "own the libs" you have to use IDE.
[09:15:43] <PapuaHardyNet> I'd like to own a lib, some of them are cute
[09:19:19] <quanticle> Fortunately for you, there are plenty of libs who are into that.
[09:22:57] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/the-truth-by-stanislaw-lem/ Not sure if you saw it, but I saw this Stanislaw Lem story linked in The Browser this week and I thought you'd find it interesting too

[09:24:18] <quanticle> PapuaHardyNet: I'm not sure I agree that depressive episodes get monotonically worse. I've had some episodes that were mild and others that were real bad. It seems to vary. The reason I haven't really reached for anti-depressants is because I know they take a few weeks to take effect, and usually by then I've snapped out of it.
[09:25:30] <PapuaHardyNet> SSRIs take weeks to take effect

[09:44:42] <namespace> quanticle: Ha. I did find the details I wanted in any case by following up on the sources he cites.
[09:44:52] <namespace> Which parts of his WW1 series pissed you off? :3
[09:46:17] <quanticle> The fact that he uncritically repeated basically all of Tuchman's "War By Timetable" thesis without referring to any of the later scholarship that showed how the march to war was *not* the result of "irreversible" mobilization plans, but was the result of contingent decisions made by leaders.
[09:46:36] <namespace> Oooh.
[09:46:54] <quanticle> It's as if he read The Guns of August, but didn't read The Sleepwalkers
[09:47:10] <namespace> But yeah, this kind of thing is exactly why I'm like "okay that's cool but I wanna look at the cites on this and the surrounding context a bit".
[09:48:51] <namespace> quanticle: FWIW, Carlin does *allude* to this at the very least. He says outright that a huge part of the war happening is that the leadership is low quality, and that if you had higher quality guys they could have defused things.
[09:49:26] <namespace> So clearly Carlin doesn't believe in *irreversible* mobilization timetables, just ones that are constraining for mediocre diplomats.
[09:49:41] <namespace> (I relistened to it recently as part of writing this essay)
[09:50:27] <quanticle> But that's just it: Clark's thesis (which, IMO was persuasive to me) was that the diplomats were *not* constrained at all by the mobilization timetables. They willingly went to war, thinking that any such war would be advantageous for them.
[09:50:53] <namespace> Ah, that's interesting.
[09:51:18] <namespace> And deflates a bit of the narrative for me, in that I really liked the parallel between WW1 and the later atomic warfare dynamics.
[09:51:20] <namespace> Oh well.
[09:51:27] <namespace> You don't get to have *all* the synchronicity I guess.
[09:51:47] <namespace> (There is...so much synchronicity in the history of X-Risk that I *actually forgot to include that one*)
[09:51:59] <namespace> (Which is great, because it means I don't have to go back and revise it)
[09:56:57] <quanticle> PapuaHardyNet: Yeah, fair enough. What put me off tricyclics in particular is the fact that they have a known side effect of muscle tremors and that side effect is known to persist even after you've stopped taking the medication. As someone who kind of needs his hands to be functional in order to work, even a slight risk of that is just straight up no-go for me.
[09:58:02] <quanticle> And MAOIs apparently just fuck you up in general. I like eating cheese (and dairy products) and apparently those are restricted foods if you're on an MAOI.

[11:51:00] <ivan> oh, legally?
[11:51:02] <feep> yes
[11:51:14] <feep> now they can be sued for statutory rape by the da
[11:51:48] <ivan> nice. you added more reality to the question than I even I considered
[11:51:55] <ivan> than even

[12:01:28] <feep> the g4 was the ultimate budget phone.

[12:03:43] <feep> ~same cpu, same screen, same battery, same network, same cameras

[12:04:22] <ivan> oh right I had a Moto G LTE
[12:04:24] <feep> ivan: like, look at the spec for the moto g8 next to the g4
[12:04:31] <feep> the screen has actually managed to get *worse*!
[12:04:33] <ivan> I've erased Android from my mind
[12:06:21] <feep> so my point here is, if the cpu could barely keep up in '15, it can still barely keep up in '20 ... cause it's basically the same cpu :V
[12:08:22] <feep> like, look at https://versus.com/en/qualcomm-snapdragon-617-vs-qualcomm-snapdragon-665

[12:08:45] <feep> this is 28nm vs 11nm, and what they got out of this is a jump from 1.5Ghz to 2Ghz.
[12:09:02] <feep> I guess ram is faster? maybe?
[12:09:19] <feep> (I'll believe it when I see a bench :P)
[12:09:40] <feep> and that's five years of progress.
[12:11:41] <feep> I truly believe that in 2030, a budget phone will be an 8core 1080p LTE (*maybe* 5g?) with a 15MP front camera, 8MP back camera, 2-4GB of RAM and a 3Ah li-ion battery for ~150€

Our two sites cater to slightly different audiences with slightly different content, but ultimately both have shared values: an interest in understanding the world and improving it. This year on Petrov Day, to
[19:55:14] <feepbot> prove the goodwill and trust between us, each site is sending out “Nuclear Launch Codes” to 100 members. You have been selected. If your launch codes are entered into the launch console on LessWrong, they will cause the EA Forum homepage to go down for the duration of Petrov Day. For the rest of the day, thousands of people will have a hard time using the site, some posts and
[19:55:14] <feepbot> comments will go unwritten, and I’ll have failed in my mission to find 100 people I could trust not to take down our friendly compatriots. If a code is entered into the launch console, both the owner of the code and the LessWrong account used to submit it will be publicly identified. LessWrong and the EA Forum both have second-strike capability that will last one hour (this is
[19:55:19] <feepbot> how long it takes for the missiles to arrive). In the event that missiles are launched at the LessWrong homepage, we ask that you very carefully consider whether or not it is correct to retaliate (button slips happen after all).

[20:44:43] <feep> also german elections and then ddate throws this at me

[20:51:23] <feep> what? I'm scared they will.
[20:51:31] <feep> fuck the cdu :v
[20:51:37] <kuudes> cdu/csu is merkel's party
[20:51:48] <kuudes> and indeed merkel seems about the best they have had to offer
[20:51:50] <adiabatic> Which one is/was Schröder's party, again?
[20:51:53] <feep> spd
[20:52:06] <feep> kuudes: yeah in no small part because of merkel undercutting any serious competitor :p
[20:52:56] <adiabatic> so you're hoping for [links green spd] [cdu fdp] [afd]?
[20:53:04] <feep> o.o?
[20:53:08] <feep> what are those [] meaning
[20:53:16] <adiabatic> coalitions
[20:53:35] <mst> feep: I remember somebody saying "the biggest problem the US democratic party has is a failure to breed a younger generation of lizard people"
[20:53:36] <feep> no I'm hoping for a *possibility* of [links green spd] in order to force fdp into [spd green fdp].
[20:54:04] <feep> as opposed to [cdu green fdp] which is fdp's preferred outcome.
[20:54:26] <feep> mst: lol
[20:54:45] <adiabatic> mst: why, they can just import lizards
[20:54:46] <catern> and you care about this because the fdp is your party of choice?
[20:54:54] <feep> well, my party of choice is the humanists
[20:55:03] <catern> your tactical voting party of chocie
[20:55:14] <feep> but barring them, my first preference is "no cdu" and my second preference is "no hard left"

[23:18:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> This went on for decades, then eventually there was enough awareness/outcry/progress/etc. that the city stopped doing this, spent 200+ million dollars on fixing the problems (capping and so on), and THEN...

[23:35:06] <adiabatic> Betawolf: standard gamer lingo
[23:35:08] <PapuaHardyNet> Obormot: no, I'm simply suspicious by the huge uptick in Aella converations in #lesswrong recently
[23:35:09] <rmmh> Apeiron Biologics
[23:35:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Betawolf: It's last generation's gamer slang
[23:35:31] <PapuaHardyNet> look, she is literally optimizing for this
[23:35:33] <Betawolf> Ah, a dead language.
[23:35:36] <rmmh> Aperion is an *extremely* hubristic name
[23:35:40] <PapuaHardyNet> we are doing exactly what she wants
[23:36:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: I want you to eat food and drink water, also to breathe air
[23:36:08] <Betawolf> She wanted us to be amused?
[23:36:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> You gonna stop doing those things now?
[23:36:16] <rmmh> let's retarget to the true purpose of this channel: cat pics https://i.imgur.com/KGWH4sj.jpeg https://i.imgur.com/aZPUxNF.jpeg
[23:36:19] <PapuaHardyNet> huh
[23:36:43] <adiabatic> AFAICT she's kind of literally attention whoring
[23:36:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Obviously
[23:36:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Literally exactly that
[23:37:01] <gwern> it's a shame. you know what they say, if you're good at something, never do it for free
[23:37:02] *** Quits: oxide (~lambda@user/oxide) (Quit: oxide)
[23:37:08] <PapuaHardyNet> you don't think she is optimizing for views and for discussions about her?
[23:37:09] <gwern> and it's not like she doesn't have platforms for paid attention whoring
[23:37:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: You've missed my point
[23:37:43] <Betawolf> She absolutely is, it's just not harmful or boring for us.
[23:38:04] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm. Perhaps I overestimate how harmful it is
[23:38:17] <shawwwn> I think you're all jealous that you're not a young beautiful sexy lady with a million followers and that you can't coast through life just by flashing your tits
[23:38:24] <kuudes> rather it gives the channel an excuse to talk about those taboos, I think
[23:38:27] <shawwwn> but that's just my opinion
[23:38:32] <adiabatic> "why do anti-beastiality taboos exist" sounds like a dumb question, though. like, she hasn't thought about it for five minutes
[23:38:33] <adiabatic> maybe two
[23:39:04] <PapuaHardyNet> shawwwn: sure, who wouldn't want to be young, beautiful, famous, and powerful, and be able to coast through life?
[23:39:12] <CoJaBo> shawwwn: Flashing your birds is indeed likely to attract cats.
[23:39:22] <shawwwn> being jealous of it is worthless though
[23:39:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: I think you're pattern-matching this onto "if an agent optimizes for causing me to do something, and if I know that things this agent wants are generally contrary to my values, then I should default to not doing things this agent wants me to do"
[23:39:43] <gwern> shawwwn: she doesn't coast. she's put in quite a lot of hard work, haven't you read any of her writeups and discussions about how to optimize it?
[23:39:50] <PapuaHardyNet> not jealous, I just have an irrational aversion to things adjacent to what Aella is doing
[23:39:51] <gwern> also, I don't think she's that young anymore, isn't she like 30 now?
[23:40:00] <adiabatic> what gwern said. she works at being famous
[23:40:01] <shawwwn> still pretty young
[23:40:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Which is a good heuristic, but notice that it requires both of those clauses
[23:40:06] <PapuaHardyNet> I cannot put it into words as of yet, and I don't want to bother others who converse about it
[23:40:52] <PapuaHardyNet> hey. Obormot, you put it into words!!
[23:40:53] * gwern has always thought that aella wasn't all *that* physically hot, which makes her success all the more impressive: she's brilliant at marketing and being more than a pair of (small) tits
[23:41:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> I do that
[23:41:07] <shawwwn> https://i.redd.it/u1aaj1m3mvp71.png
[23:42:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: I agree; I've seen bits of her porn a couple times and have found it fairly unimpressive (of course that one with the gnome was good for a laugh, though not really good as porn). That she's successful nonetheless is an accomplishment
[23:42:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> It ain't curing cancer but it's not coasting either
[23:42:30] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: exactly, the gnomes - you *have* seen the gnome one
[23:42:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right - "ah, but you *have* heard of me"
[23:43:17] <gwern> exactly, yes. OBORMOT: "you are, without a doubt, the worst gnome pornstar I've ever heard of" CAPT AELLA: "Ah, but you *have* heard of me"
[23:44:29] <gwern> anyway, that's why I personally like aella. it's one of those competence porn things where an expert in a field you are totally unfamiliar with (and mostly uninterested in) explains what makes it tick
[23:45:00] <gwern> I generally tend to regard the polls as SFW demos of her skillz
[23:46:40] <shawwwn> gwern likes a giiiiiirrlll
[23:47:03] <gwern> it'd be more impressive if she were a guy, but oh well
[23:47:11] <CoJaBo> wat
[23:47:14] <shawwwn> oh? you're into that? I'd almost given up hope
[23:47:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, well, one follows one's natural advantage
[23:47:55] <gwern> CoJaBo: well, think about it. either she'd be a trap, which is an even weirder market niche, or she'd just be gayella, and I know little to nothing about how homosexual camming works so I'd learn even more from his writeups
[23:48:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: I think the answer is mostly "it doesn't"
[23:48:33] <gwern> but she's just a white hetero/bi girl camming. if only by osmosis, everyone can guess a lot about it
[23:48:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> iirc in her camming writeup Aella said something like "and if you're a guy... god help you"
[23:48:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that was more or less the sum of her advice to guys who want to cam
[23:48:55] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: right, but she didn't say it was impossible and I *have* read about a fair number of men on onlyfans etc
[23:48:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure
[23:49:02] <gwern> so as I said, be more impressive
[23:49:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah I suppose so
[23:49:46] <CoJaBo> gwern: I think that's considered offensive now lol
[23:49:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> What is
[23:49:58] <gwern> if so, I hope traps reclaim trap
[23:50:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm given to understand that lots of people self-describe that way...
[23:50:19] <gwern> maybe it's a trap for people who get indignant online
[23:50:29] <saturn2> it's not like she's invented a previously unknown attention whoring technique
[23:50:33] <gwern> 'haha, it wasn't offensive at all! you fell for our...'
[23:51:15] <saturn2> she's just using the usual tactics and aiming them at a group that had less competition
[23:51:34] <Betawolf> an entirely new technique would be interesting, but excelling at an old game is still impressive
[23:51:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's rare indeed that someone invents something previously unknown
[23:51:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Surely that's not the baseline for being impressed by things

[23:52:11] <shawwwn> I'm still laughing I was so tired that I put questionmarks after an email address instead of +
[23:52:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And it would be pathological to make it so, because that then exerts a pressure for novelty, which is corrosive in many ways)
[23:52:24] <shawwwn> I meant to try foo+@tensorfork.com but put foo?@tensorfork.com
[23:52:31] <shawwwn> I assume none of the cards got delivered
[23:52:54] <saturn2> i didn't receive any card
[23:53:06] <gwern> those gpus are now the homeless's now
[23:54:27] <RiversHaveWings> Obormot\Arcturus: one group *does* identify as "traps" and another group *does* consider it offensive, there's Discourse about it
[23:54:41] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: if i were novel it would still be reprehensible but at least it might be interesting
[23:54:48] <saturn2> it*
[23:55:00] <shawwwn> saturn2: how about now
[23:55:38] <shawwwn> is it glxl.com or glxl.net
[23:55:43] <shawwwn> or glxl.ai
[23:55:47] <saturn2> .net
[23:56:24] <shawwwn> kay, I sent like 30 cards to all permutations of saturn2
[23:56:30] <shawwwn> I assume you got one somewhere
[23:56:58] <saturn2> k i'll check in a minute
[23:57:06] <shawwwn> ditto for PapuaHardyNet 
[23:57:27] <shawwwn> gwern wants a card too but he's too proud to ask
[23:57:37] <shawwwn> so I guess I'll send him one
