Specifically it seems to think that that virtual account is actually a _group_ and not a _user_ and it designates it as such in the master login tables in the database
[06:20:39] <wroathe> Has anyone else dealt with anything similar while setting up a Windows container?

[20:11:33] <scottg489> Would it be safe to build a docker image with a java keystore built into it? The keystore has a private key so I assume it wouldn't be, correct?
[20:12:05] <ikke> correct, everyone with the image can read the key
[20:12:25] <scottg489> well they'd need the password but if they have the priv key they're kinda half way there which isn't ideal
[20:13:52] <rawtaz> the fact that it's in a docker image doesnt change anything or relevant IMO, the discussion is about how safe it is if someone gets a hold of that keystore in general

[20:15:34] <scottg489> So if it had a public key baked in that would be fine I believe
[20:15:44] <ikke> yes
[20:19:30] <tabakhase> SpeakerToMeat absolutely not - (but having VOLUME lines can still make sense as its a) free documentation that ships with the image and b) makes docker put a annon-volume in that path even if the user does not request it, often makes no difference, but can come in clutch :P

[23:14:23] <imp> is there any caveat to makes logging work on docker logs? I cant see any of the logs. But If I run the application without docker the logs shows up perfectly.
[23:16:25] <SpeakerToMeat> Question, I'm using portainer. And I'm trying to create a container, and I see I can only select volumes that exist.
[23:16:46] <SpeakerToMeat> If I create the volume via portainer first, will it still be fillen with the contents of the original directory on first run?
[23:17:18] <rawtaz> SpeakerToMeat: hrdly, i dont see why a volume you create would get some contents populated automatically. i dont use portainer though
[23:17:53] <SpeakerToMeat> So there's no way to do like with docker-compose, that the contents get populard on first run when the volume is created...
[23:19:52] <SpeakerToMeat> I'll try using compose to create a stack (through portainer) to see if it works that way
