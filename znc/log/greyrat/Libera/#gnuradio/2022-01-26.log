[02:56:50] <marvinXP> maybe because I didn't use square brackets in the name.
[02:57:09] <marvinXP> Oh well, I fixed my "the hier block doesn't show up" by manually copying the yml to ~/.grc_gnuradio/

[06:34:41] <BarryDuggan[m]> Now there are no errors in https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/blob/main/gr-digital/examples/packet/example_corr_est_and_clock_sync.grc BUT there are no signals on the QT GUI Time traces. They are set for tag trigger on `corr_est` and `corr_start` tags, but there don't seem to be any tags. If I change to Auto trigger, the data can be seen.
[06:34:41] <BarryDuggan[m]> Also, the Channel Model blocks tag propagation of the packet_len tag.
[06:46:11] <BarryDuggan[m]> based on this item https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/discuss-gnuradio/2022-01/msg00122.html it was a problem in 3.8 also

[16:45:34] <mobizmn[m]> Another random question. Is there a block in GNU Radio in which we can specify a packet length n, such that the block inputs n items and outputs the same n items at the output? 
[16:45:54] <mobizmn[m]> The Stream to Tagged Stream block works exactly like that, but it also adds tags.
[16:45:58] <Yamakaja[m]> What would that block do?
[16:48:04] <Yamakaja[m]> I mean to me it sounds like an "Identity" operation
[16:48:04] <mobizmn[m]> Is there a block that does the same thing as Stream to Tagged Stream without adding tags?

[16:48:05] <mobizmn[m]> Yamakaja[m]: Can you elaborate more on this?
[16:48:29] <mobizmn[m]> For example, I have a signal source. I need to send a fixed number of samples from this block with a specified delay.

[16:49:46] <mobizmn[m]> Basically, I want to do something like this, but for streams
[16:49:48] *** Joins: TheCoffeMaker (~TheCoffeM@user/thecoffemaker)
[16:50:05] <mobizmn[m]> I am trying to create a packet_tx block for streams.
[16:50:38] <willcode4[m]> Think of streams as being continuous, where PDUs are discrete.
[16:53:10] <Yamakaja[m]> GNU Radio doesn't have a notion of "a block of samples in my stream starts here, and it ends here". Streams are assumed by the scheduler to represent a continuous waveform as in it can be cut up at arbitrary places when being fed to other blocks. This doesn't mean however that GNU Radio assigns inherent meaning to those samples, so it is still possible to cut up a stream into "packets" using stream tags, but your blocks will have to handle
[16:53:10] <Yamakaja[m]> those explicitly

[17:02:51] <mobizmn[m]> I kind of didn't understand that at all😅.
[17:04:01] <mobizmn[m]> Let me ask a broader question. The packet_tx and packet_rx examples in gr-digital are working on messages. Is it possible to create a similar packet structure for stream data?
[17:08:16] <bpadalino> it sounds like you want a block that receives pdu's .. and that block will send 0's when there isn't a pdu to send, but when there is one to send, it modulates it appropriately - is that what you're looking to do?
[17:08:30] <bpadalino> so messages in, stream out
[17:13:58] <mobizmn[m]> Umm No. I want a block that takes a continuous stream, and forwards n samples from that stream as a packet at the output. And it does that repeatedly after an interval.
[17:14:28] *** Joins: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter)
[17:14:29] <bpadalino> so this is for reception ?
[17:14:48] <mobizmn[m]> And I just realized that my reference to Stream to Tagged Stream block was completely wrong, because it only adds tags and not packets
[17:14:59] <mobizmn[m]> No, its for transmission
[17:15:39] <bpadalino> what are you trying to accomplish? this seems pretty backwards to me
[17:16:32] <mobizmn[m]> Are you familiar with the packet_tx and packet_rx examples in gr-digital?
[17:16:58] <bpadalino> i want to know more like, at a high level concept, what are you wanting to do?
[17:18:26] <mobizmn[m]> I want to create packets from a signal source, and then I want to transmit it over a USRP device with burst transmissions.
[17:21:05] <bpadalino> which USRP are you using, if you don't mind me asking ?
[17:23:03] <mobizmn[m]> USRP N2920
[17:23:29] <mobizmn[m]>  * USRP 2920
[17:24:03] <bpadalino> gotcha ..
[17:24:23] <bpadalino> just wondering, what you read through this: https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/USRP_Sink#Bursty_Transmission

[17:29:46] <mobizmn[m]> I did read this. I want to perform encoding and modulation on the data before sending it. Hmm, so maybe I can do the exact same thing as in the packet examples, without creating packets at all. Since I just want to perform those operations...
[17:30:07] <mobizmn[m]> And the packets could be created when I transmit over the USRP device.
[17:30:16] <mobizmn[m]> I shall think more on this.
[17:30:32] *** Quits: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[17:31:39] <mobizmn[m]> But then many of the blocks use the parameter of packet length
[17:31:50] <mobizmn[m]> I am so confused 😅
[17:33:58] <bpadalino> did you plan to use SOB/EOB tags, or tagged streams ?
[17:40:40] <mobizmn[m]> I just want to modulate and encode the data before sending it. And packet_tx example seemed like a good starting. I have trying using GFSK modulation, but I am unable to recover the data after receiving at the USRP. So, I wanted to try to replicate packet_loopback_hier example to see if that worked.

[19:36:55] <warnes[m]> Can someone explain (or point me to a page) the difference between RF, IF, and BB gain?
[19:43:17] <DerekKozel[m]> That's specific to your hardware, the manufacturer should have that info
[19:44:01] <DerekKozel[m]> I think the RTL uses those terms in their driver? 
[19:45:51] <patchvonbraun[m]> warnes: some devices only pay attention to the RF gain parameter and distribute gain as appropriate to achieve goals like linearity or sensitivity.
[19:46:59] <patchvonbraun[m]> Most radios have multiple points in the RF chain where you can set gain.

[20:08:30] <warnes[m]> Ok, I'm using a bladeRF 2.0, which seems to only provide a single gain stetting for each TX,RX stream, and, in fact, defaults to having AGC.
[20:08:30] <warnes[m]>  
[20:10:52] <warnes[m]> patchvonbraun: OK, on RX so there could be an amp in the analog section before the ADC, one in the digital section after the ADC, and one in the software before any decoder.  Correct? 
[20:12:02] <patchvonbraun[m]> warnes: you can put a multiply in the steam in yuur code.
[20:12:29] <warnes[m]> patchvonbraun: Nod.
[20:13:14] <patchvonbraun[m]> Gain-setting details are excruciatingly hardware dependent.  The AD9361 (used on the BladeRF and USRP B200 series) is really quite complex in gain setting, which is why the drivers tend to have a bunch of smarts in them and the user gain-setting is used to "guide" those smarts.
[20:14:51] <patchvonbraun[m]> The R820T2 has a post-ADC "gain" setting, but it's not recommended to use it.  USRPs generally don't do that.
[20:15:16] <patchvonbraun[m]> Don't know about BladeRF, but probably no post-ADC "gain" setting 
[20:16:14] <patchvonbraun[m]> If your demodulator requires a particular sample magnitude to function, you can put an AGC block in your Gnu Radio code.

[20:20:08] <patchvonbraun[m]> The FM demods often work best when the input magnitude has been AGCed into {-1,1}--at least, that's what I recall.
[20:20:56] <warnes[m]> I can see from the frequency sink, that the frequency distribution for the NBFM is quite a bit narrower than the original WAV data.
[20:21:10] <patchvonbraun[m]> but don't forget about sample-rate matching.   If the audio sink requires samples at rate <X>, you MUST arrange for that rate to be presented to the audio sink.  Gnu Radio can't do that for you.  That's roughly equivalent to a compiler "knowing" what you're trying to accomplish and doing it for you.
[20:21:59] <patchvonbraun[m]> also, 10dB of attenuation is probably too small.  Remember that a receiver is mostly optimized for direct-connection to an ANTENNA, and magnitudes there are MUCH MUCH MUCH smaller.
[20:23:25] <patchvonbraun[m]> For a receiver, a -50dBm signal is actually quite "loud".

[20:39:42] <warnes[m]> What value would you suggest to target?  
[20:41:46] <patchvonbraun[m]> For NBFM if you target -50dbm at the receiver you’re probably good. I think the AD9361 puts out about +10dBm at max gain. Dunno if bladder has a gain stage after the RF chip.

[20:59:20] <jholtom> patchvonbraun[m]: depends on who you are I spose
[20:59:30] <patchvonbraun[m]> Might as well start with a high SNR signal that is still within the linearity limits.
[20:59:48] <jholtom> oh yeah, for sure, it'll be excellent for that purpose
[21:00:33] <patchvonbraun[m]> When you’re trying to debug basic issues, it helps to be certain that your input signal doesn’t have SNR issues.
[21:00:50] <jholtom> all my work right now hovers around the noise floor or below it and so having like -50dBm of power is odd

[22:32:16] <DerekKozel[m]> Hi naashit10 
[22:33:47] <DerekKozel[m]> There's a few places you could contribute. Most of the GNU Radio code is in C++, but the GNU Radio Companion is written in Python and there are a few bugs and features that need to be taken care of.
[22:34:38] <DerekKozel[m]> If you wanted to contribute there the best place to start would be to build GNU Radio from source successfully and go through the first 3-4 tutorials just to learn how to use the interface a little.
[22:35:22] <DerekKozel[m]> Separately from the main software we have a few websites that could very much use help improving pieces of them, but we don't have as clear a list of things that need doing.
[22:36:27] *** Joins: Malvolio (~Malvolio@user/malvolio)
[22:38:31] <DerekKozel[m]> For instance either of these two issues is a good place to learn how the GNU Radio Companion code works, write the code for the change, and learn the process of contributing the change to the project.

[22:43:46] <DerekKozel[m]> This video is a pretty good guide to how it works to use GitHub to make your own copy of the GNU Radio code, make changes, and then send the changes back to the project for review.
