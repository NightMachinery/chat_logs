[19:11:00] <noStory> CSV in some AI
[19:18:10] <mefistofeles> I guess you have to be more specific...  
[19:19:20] <noStory> downloaded Anaconda python with Jupyter for windows
[19:19:37] <noStory> and got a .csv file from kaggle.com datasets
[19:21:00] <noStory> how to use any AI/ML algorithm and plot graph or do something AIie with csv
[19:22:33] <noStory> also downloaded scipy-1.8.0.zip . what to do with it. or itsuseless
[19:26:21] <mefistofeles> noStory: csv is just a plain-text data file format
[19:27:17] <mefistofeles> noStory: sounds like you first need to get familiar with dealing with data with python or so. I can recommend following this https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/ 
[19:34:17] <noStory> handbook. ok. slow at reading
[19:34:21] <noStory> very slow
[19:34:32] <noStory> just wanted to copy paste command and insert csv file
[19:35:28] <noStory> but currently that 6.7GB python folder can do only int c=a+b and math and loops right ?

[20:50:51] <mefistofeles> noStory: if you isntalled anaconda you also have some ML and AI with scikit learn, not sure if tensorflow is installed by default (probably not), but you already have many of its dependencies installed (same holds for torch)
[20:51:20] <mefistofeles> which are probably the two biggest ML/AI frameworks
[20:51:59] <noStory> so AI is going to plot living craZy graphs ? 
[20:52:40] <mefistofeles> noStory: no, you should do that yourself :)
[20:52:53] <mefistofeles> but there are many packages/libs that will help you with that
[20:53:01] <noStory> like X1=5, X2=10. It will make X3=15 or something random fUN
[20:53:36] <noStory> AI is supposed to be inaccurate like humans and not perfect like computer math 
[20:53:37] <noStory> ?
[20:53:59] <noStory> ok will run,. its all like MS-DOS linux trash. Anaconda C++ JAVA watever
[20:54:27] <mefistofeles> yeah, that's how computing is made, better get familiar with shell/terminals, it pays off
[20:54:31] <noStory> googl and youtube what to be done with csv
[20:55:09] <noStory> eYe pain. small 14" laptop screen
[20:55:21] <noStory> will buy paper book
[20:56:38] <mefistofeles> noStory: ok, just as a recommendation, take your time, don't rush through things, these things require some effort and if you want to get serious about them you want to do it right
[21:27:11] <noStory> homwork
[21:27:46] <noStory> "get 2 datasets and see how to use". But deep algorithms, not even CNN ANN 
[21:27:49] <noStory> i dont know
