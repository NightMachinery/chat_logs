[02:16:29] <fendor[m]> yeah, I didn't understand that test either
[02:16:33] <fendor[m]> I can debug tomorrow

[02:24:31] <maralorn> jneira: pepeiborra: Apparently Chart-diagrams is not maintained anymore. I donâ€˜t know if you care, but since we are currently switching to ghc 9.0 in nixpkgs, there wonâ€˜t be a working shake-bench in nixpkgs anymore. Might affect your nix stuff \cc berberman_.
[02:25:25] <maralorn> Hm, the problem is actually lens 5 compat.
[02:25:57] <maralorn> So maybe I can get to build with older lens, but not sure if that works for your testsuite.

[03:22:32] <maralorn> <maralorn> "jneira: pepeiborra: Apparently..." <- I take that back. I was stupid. shake-bench is just fine.

[15:13:57] <fendor[m]> ðŸ˜€ you are awesome! 
[15:17:12] <maerwald> I wish the output would actually show the stdout/stderr of the binary it executes
[15:18:34] <fendor[m]> can't we log the output?
[15:36:46] <maerwald> probably, I'm too lazy
[15:46:32] <maerwald> we should merge it soon, otherwise I'll get new ideas and it will never be ready
