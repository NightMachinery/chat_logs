[04:14:51] <johncs> I believe I was promised hash tables
[04:15:29] <bookworm> well, what was the thing with your amortized constant time if not a hashtable? 
[04:15:54] <bookworm> but it's 3am and I should've gone to bed 3 hours earlier than now so forgive me if I drop out quickly
[04:16:18] <johncs> haha get some sleep, you were totally right, I'm pretty sure it was a hash table I was talking about back then
[04:16:25] <johncs> but it was quite a few years ago so I really don't remember
[04:16:39] <johncs> I think I was trying to implement a min-max heap at the time, so maybe it had something to do with that
[04:16:58] <shadoozo> Hmm I should've done that too
[04:18:12] <Activ8> Hey doozo 
[04:18:17] <Activ8> not seen you in a while
[04:19:15] <bookworm> how IRC reacts depends a lot on the channel though. Some of the more nerdy ones (bash / email / postfix etc) have a rather... hard tone
[04:19:39] <bookworm> some others expect you to do your homework first, rather than being spoonfed
[04:20:23] <bookworm> and to be honest, all those questions which are trivially googled annoy me as well. No worries if you don't understand something and need clarifications. But simple things that are quite literally in the official docs on page 1?
[04:21:04] <johncs> haha fair
[04:21:24] <johncs> i was pretty active on a programming help Discord for awhile. was a teacher for a few years too. it's a time
[04:21:56] <Activ8> Coding/programming isnâ€™t easy 
[04:22:06] <bookworm> nobody said it was
[04:22:19] <johncs> for sure, it's properly hard
[04:22:54] <bookworm> you can pick your battles with the programming language you choose
[04:23:07] <bookworm> js is... not good in that regard
[04:23:19] <Activ8> Iâ€™ve learnt a lot just by been here and a lot of the time Iâ€™ve held off asking.  Some people donâ€™t ask for the fear of feeling stupid.
[04:23:38] <Activ8> and the majority of the time itâ€™s probably simple to the experienced person 
[04:24:02] <bookworm> there's a difference between a "simple" answer and a trivial one
[04:24:06] <johncs> beginner programming specific channels are great for that I feel
[04:24:42] <bookworm> if you ask "what parameters does the print function accept" without even trying to figure it out, yes then you are indeed not the kind of person I'd like to interact with
[04:25:27] <bookworm> if you ask, hey how would you structure X I tried Y here's the code but it gives error blah, which I don't quite understand, now which one do you think is worth interacting with?
[04:25:47] <Activ8> High standards then eh lol difficult to please but on that note shouldnâ€™t you be asleep?
[04:26:07] <bookworm> yes
[04:26:16] <bookworm> â˜• will fix it in the morning
[04:26:24] <bookworm> and future me can hate past me, wouldn't be a first
[04:26:43] <Activ8> Itâ€™s all that coding your doing 
[04:26:55] <bookworm> for now present me is sufficiently entertained to not want to sleep
[04:27:33] <bookworm> I'm a lab technician not related to any sorts of coding professionally if that's what you mean
[04:27:40] <Activ8> I should be asleep itâ€™s 2am nearly UK time.  I do this every time.
[04:27:50] <Activ8> really???
[04:27:52] <johncs> i got real pumped on that PR I put out yesterday. Stayed up an hour or so after my bedtime finishing it. Surprised it worked as well as it did, though waking up in the morning it was definitely clear I'd written that with a tired mind.
[04:27:59] <Activ8> I would have never guessed!!!
[04:28:10] <Activ8> two completely different trade offs
[04:28:15] <johncs> i gotta get my bedtime back in order
[04:28:44] <johncs> what kind of lab tech bookworm?
[04:28:46] <Activ8> i never stay up this late Iâ€™m always asleep by 10pm usually
[04:28:47] <johncs> I'm imagining computer lab
[04:28:55] <johncs> but that can't be right
[04:29:12] <bookworm> in theory chemical lab tech, alas I've since migrated more to the biology side of things
[04:29:17] <Activ8> I wouldnâ€™t put a bet on that lol
[04:30:12] <Activ8> find the combination to the secret drug that can make people code.  Iâ€™ll have your problems fixed in an hour ðŸ˜‚
[04:30:13] <johncs> Oh man I think I've met some bio lab techs but all I remember are jokes about pipettes
[04:30:26] <bookworm> XD sounds like us alright
[04:30:53] <bookworm> neat particle sim on your website btw
[04:30:58] <Activ8> Your not like Sheldon from Big Bang theory are you?
[04:31:00] <johncs> aw thank you :)
[04:31:02] <johncs> I love that thing
[04:31:44] <bookworm> definitely not, physics isn't my strong suit, assuming sheldan is the PENNY, PENNY, PENNY guy
[04:32:06] <bookworm> (been a while since I watched it last)
[04:32:33] <Activ8> I love it only for penny though ðŸ˜‚ 
[04:33:14] <bookworm> n any case, see you around, was nice chatting (even if it fall somewhat short)
[04:33:38] <johncs> night bookworm, nice meeting you :)
[04:33:54] <bookworm> fell* see, can't even type
[04:34:00] <Activ8> Sleep!
[04:34:05] * bookworm complies
[04:34:05] <Activ8> night
