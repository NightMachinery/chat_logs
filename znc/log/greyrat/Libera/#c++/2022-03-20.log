[00:04:25] <Batzy> if i have a recursive function where im doing some operation on say, ints. Is it better to pass the int in as a pointer? If I just accept an int argument, does something happen like it takes time to copy the value or something?
[00:04:51] <Batzy> or if i really just need the value, maybe I should pass it in by reference?

[00:17:36] <Alipha> Batzy: no, pass it by value. Passing by pointer or reference means you're now passing the int's address, which means you're making a copy of the address, so you're not saving anything there. In fact, passing by pointer/reference now means the program has to do additional work to dereference the address to get the int value at that address, which means passing by pointer/reference is actually going to be slower

[00:25:05] <Alipha> The rule of thumb is that if you have a struct/class larger than 3 ints in size, then it's cheaper to pass by value. (or if the struct/class has an expensive copy constructor)

[05:06:31] <bpalmer> Gamah: so ignore thing.h ; just assume it's part of your text at top of the top.
[05:06:56] <bpalmer> you have something like 'struct thing { public: void run(int a, int b, int c); }' ?
[05:08:08] <bpalmer> See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10673585/start-thread-with-member-function for one approach, although you could also use std::bind directly
[05:08:16] <Gamah> yes class thing{ public void run(x,y,z)};
[05:08:30] <bpalmer> something like std::thread(thing::run, &newthing, ...);
[05:09:59] <Gamah> let me see if i understand that..

[05:21:04] <Gamah> third time is the charm?
[05:21:40] <bpalmer> Gamah: so, yeah, that's exactly what that stack overflow is addressing.
[05:23:12] <bpalmer> Gamah: to call std::thread with a member function, you have to pass the unbound member function and then pass the this pointer for it explicitly. So something like threads.push_back(std::thread(game::runGame, &newGame, newRengine, std::ref(shoesPlayed)));
[05:23:23] <bpalmer> howveer, this brings up a more serious issue: your game lifetime.
[05:23:35] <Gamah> lifetime?

[05:24:02] <bpalmer> C++, unlike languages like java, requires you to pay attention to when an object is created and destroyed.
[05:24:11] <Gamah> oh yeah i already have all of that handled

[05:25:22] <Gamah> hm...
[05:25:36] <Gamah> well i want a new instancce for each therad.
[05:25:47] <Gamah> so i don't want game g = game() then...
[05:25:51] <bpalmer> so you need to make sure it lives at least as long as each thread lives.
[05:26:36] <bpalmer> There are many ways to go about this ; one of the easier ways is to allocate each on the heap with, say, new game(); and then have the thread take on the responsibility of deleting it.
[05:26:59] <Gamah> so like a vector of game?
[05:27:18] <bpalmer> that is another way you could approach it. But fundamentally, pay attention to the lifetime of your objects.
[05:27:22] <Gamah> i don't actually care about checking back in on the threads.
[05:27:46] <Gamah> they're writing back to a vector of int which i'm using to determine that they've exited.
[05:27:48] <bpalmer> for whta you're doing, you may not need a game object at all; why use a class?
[05:28:04] <Gamah> not sure... OOP go brr? is namespace what i'm looking for?
[05:28:10] <bpalmer> if the only thing you're usign the class for is to hold a public member function, just use a top-level function instead.
[05:28:20] <bpalmer> or a namespaced function, sure.
[05:28:55] <Gamah> would you still do h/cpp files for namespaces?

[22:47:46] <energizer> for a behavior that's "implementation defined", is a compiler allowed to make it an error?
[22:48:51] <bpalmer> it may not fail to compile the program.
[22:49:10] <energizer> s/may/must/ ?
[22:49:57] <bpalmer> right, yes. If a behavior of some construct is implementation defined, the construct is legal C++, so should be accepted by the compiler.
