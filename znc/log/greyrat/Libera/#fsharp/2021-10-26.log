[19:37:28] <sonny> How do I work with files and character encodings in fsharp?
[19:38:30] <sonny> Are these provided by the .Net sdks?
[19:42:05] <indomitable> files are hard, biberu will give you a twelve minute explanation of why
[19:42:12] <indomitable> once he has prepared his boy
[19:42:13] <indomitable> body'
[19:42:15] <indomitable> ***
[19:51:07] <sonny> hope that doesn't take a while
[19:55:17] <biberu> sonny: yes, it's the usual c# apis from system.io (e.g. system.io.file) and system.text (e.g. system.text.utf8encoding)
[19:55:52] <biberu> sonny: are you familiar with those?
[19:58:43] <biberu> indomitable: my body is prepared but nothing is happening
[19:59:46] <indomitable> what, i get a tirade about how to do it with immutability, and he gets "use c# stuff"?
[19:59:49] <indomitable> goddamnit biberu :P
[20:00:18] * biberu mutates indomitable
[20:00:28] <indomitable> your wife/husband will be jealous
[20:00:43] <indomitable> wifeband. spouse.
[20:00:44] <biberu> we've already done enough mutating for a while
[20:00:47] <indomitable> husife?
[20:01:47] <sonny> biberu: no, I am new to c# and f#. right now I'm reading the docs
[20:02:22] <sonny> Is it right to assume there can only be one entry point in a project?
[20:03:54] <sonny> I am going to be doing some lexing and parsing, from the docs it seems encoding is just for storage not working with strings. my data is pretty much ascii
[20:04:06] <biberu> there can only be one selected, but if you for whatever reason need to build it with different entry points you can
[20:12:10] <biberu> sonny: here's a trivial example, maybe something to play around with: https://gist.github.com/biberu/341236e88b98ea3e620f71fa4c6a9ab2
[20:12:21] <sonny> There is no puts like function in f# right, i'd have to use something from system?
[20:13:01] <biberu> you probably want printfn
[20:13:07] <sonny> nice style, that is great that you can use seq that way
[20:13:08] <biberu> see line 17
[20:13:42] <indomitable> biberu loves fun
[20:13:47] <biberu> yes
[20:13:49] <sonny> there is another method with $ (interpolation?)
[20:14:16] <biberu> printfn $"{line}"
[20:14:33] <biberu> printfn $"here is my {line} etc"
[20:15:05] <biberu> semi-afk for a bit, replies might be slow :)
[20:15:29] <biberu> and welcome to the channel :)
[20:15:52] <sonny> thanks :-)
[20:17:11] <sonny> does the second method use reflection?
[20:17:51] <sonny> no, it'd just need it to have a toString method I think
[20:26:43] <indomitable> everything has a tostring method, so that should work out
