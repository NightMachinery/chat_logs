[16:29:02] <pe> You can clone from the bare, but working trees... maybe.
[16:29:53] <pe> It's not obvious to me what you want to achieve.
[16:30:14] <amazigh> basically what fossil does, let me explain
[16:31:27] <amazigh> I want to deduplicate git history, so that I can git checkout /path/to/BARE-REPO COMMIT ./INSIDE/WORK-DIRECTORY-ONE/

[16:32:38] <pe> You want to deduplicate the object tree.
[16:32:47] <amazigh> The repository I deal with, is large ~2G, if any time I need to checkout another tree, git clone the whole thing, it becomes unweavy
[16:32:48] <rbasak> Maybe "git worktree" is that you want?
[16:33:30] <rbasak> It's also possible to clone locally without needing to copy everything by referring to the clone.
[16:33:34] <rbasak> (like a symlink)
[16:33:40] <gthm> I'd look into git worktree
[16:33:51] <rbasak> git clone --reference
[16:34:04] <gthm> or if you want very slow read-only checkouts, you could use this terrible FUSE things I wrote once
[16:34:10] <rbasak> So you could make a local "master" clone, and then use git clone --reference against it for all the others, and you'd only be storing the repo once.
[16:34:39] * amazigh looking at git worktree
[16:35:24] <rbasak> Even if you don't use --reference, I think by default hardlinks are used for a local clone, so that doesn't use duplicate space either.

[17:19:55] <gthm> the idea was to have a dir with the various master/trunk/main branches checked out, with git hooks to prevent me from committing changes to them, and a cronjob that pulled them regularly so I could have local code search
[17:20:19] <gthm> and then scripts that were wrappers around git-worktree to create and checkout local dev branches in another dir
