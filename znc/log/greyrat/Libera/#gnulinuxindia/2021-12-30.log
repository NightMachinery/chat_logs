[12:29:37] <NeoVoid[m]> while people who uses low brightness and dark mode gets eye problems more often.
[12:29:37] <NeoVoid[m]> a study also proves this and its also true to my own observation.

[20:30:52] <voidsoul> wut
[20:31:01] <Hemishhehim[m]> <MohdAariz[m]> "what do you guys think of void..." <- It was good and nice, better than artix runit. I had random problems here and there with packages, services, dbus in artix which were not in void. Xbps package manager is also as fast as Pacman. There is void-packages like aur but it's not so vast as AUR.... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/bbae4e2955e48b0a0cbfa6ed1bf3e7d8f22b1cd0)
[20:31:43] <Amit[m]> Also Artix is based on Arch and Void is Indepe1
[20:31:48] <Amit[m]> Independent**
[20:31:50] <Hemishhehim[m]> Amit[m]: Yep
[20:33:40] <voidsoul> i heard news that artix is now independent of arch
[20:33:52] <MohdAariz[m]> damn
[20:33:56] <MohdAariz[m]> really?
[20:35:34] <voidsoul> i am not exactly sure but they actually working on it (in my opinion) cuz they have now independent artix repo and doesn't use repos by default. but you can still add them if you want.
[20:35:53] <voidsoul> *arch repos
[20:36:00] <MohdAariz[m]> damn
[20:36:06] <MohdAariz[m]> that seems cool
[20:36:15] <voidsoul> yes
[20:36:39] <voidsoul> i disabled arch repos i never had any issue 
[20:37:11] <voidsoul> may be thats a first step toward independence
[20:39:47] <MohdAariz[m]> no one is on the irc
[20:39:51] <Hemishhehim[m]> voidsoul: I need arch repos, cuz there are some software, not in AUR but present in official arch repos, but not in artix repos
[20:40:13] <MohdAariz[m]> i mean is there yay on void linux?
[20:40:20] <Hemishhehim[m]> And yes last time I installed artix, it had independent repos and didn't have arch repos
[20:40:36] <Hemishhehim[m]> But I think that would still be dependent on arch, cuz they mirror arch repos
[20:42:00] <Hemishhehim[m]> Hey, how can we round off decimal in bash?
[20:42:08] <Hemishhehim[m]> MohdAariz[m]: No
[20:42:18] <MohdAariz[m]> sad
