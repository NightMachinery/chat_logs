[17:08:00] <inky_> Joanna, i think j. b. peterson was saying that being adventerous, open and creative is usually connected. not always though.
[17:09:34] <inky_> i know two brothers, one likes lay and sleep, other travels with his car, explores areas, is very open, absorbs info.

[18:23:18] <jan6> technically, yes, inky_, but they don't seem to be usable, for me
