[07:44:47] <hayley> I don't think they need fill pointers, but they're useful.
[07:45:40] <hayley> The fill pointer lets you have an array which can store more elements than you are currently storing, so that you don't resize so often.
[07:46:05] <kakuhen> so it's to ease the burden of resizing an array then, right

[10:04:37] <qhong> moon-child: hmm, or I can see one can have very "light-weight" package that is just a string (prefix), and have it passed to READ
[10:05:13] <moon-child> yes.  Packages are syntax sugar
[10:05:34] <qhong> It still doesn't sound perfect. Even if one insists that package is just string, they are still conceptually namespace and need to be organized. Environments are a good way to organize namespace, but we somehow simply cannot use it for packages
[10:05:51] <moon-child> why not?
[10:06:06] <moon-child> (defvar *packages* (make-hash-table))
[10:06:47] <moon-child> again, there are circularity problems at bootstrap time, because *packages* is a symbol and a symbol needs to have a package, but those are not hard to resolve, and they do not exist at run time
[10:07:26] <moon-child> (or, you know, s/hash-table/environment/, w/e)
[10:08:33] <moon-child> *packages* goes in the global environment.  I assume you have one of those
[10:09:37] <qhong> yes. And there need to be a global environment and a global package ex nihilo
[10:11:34] <moon-child> indeed.  But what is wrong with that?
[10:11:53] <qhong> still a bit unsure. Say I'm going to nuke OS and use solely the lisp system as my computing environment, which device should be used in place of Unix filesystem? Packages or nested environments?
[10:12:20] <moon-child> why do you need to pick one?
[10:12:28] <moon-child> say all objects are persisted to disc transparently
[10:12:53] <moon-child> all the types of objects you can create--symbols, environments, strings, ...--acts as a replacement for the unix file system
[10:12:59] <moon-child> *act
[10:16:18] <hayley> "None of that is going to get rid of the problem of garbage collection however. That’s pretty much inherent in lisp." You can get rid of the problem if you stop seeing it as one. :)
[10:16:42] <qhong> moon-child: unix file system organize resource in a hierarchical way (for better and for worth), and mostly give each resource a unique identifier
[10:17:30] <moon-child> ok.  If you want to create such a data structure, you certainly can.  I'm not going to tell you what the right way to do that is, though
[10:18:00] <qhong> having two separate binding construct makes it a bit more cumbersome
[10:18:03] <moon-child> re packages: packages do not create a mapping to _data_.  Only to symbols.  And symbols do not contain any meaningful data.  A symbol is _only_ meaningful in context of an environment, which can map it to a value
[10:18:16] <moon-child> so I have no idea how you expect to be able to use packages to access data
[10:19:29] <moon-child> I mean, if you object to the notion that a symbol can have a package, why do you not also object to the notion that a symbol can have a name?  Aren't there already two means of binding: one from names to symbols, and another from symbols to values?
[10:19:34] <qhong> moon-child: a nested chain of environment can be used to access data, but the key are symbol, and in our presumed case, has both name component and package component
[10:20:16] <moon-child> so you want to distinguish foo -> bar -> baz from foo:bar -> baz?
[10:20:41] <qhong> that has to be the case
[10:20:46] <moon-child> hmmm
[10:20:58] <qhong> I feel like it makes the identifier usage much more confusing
[10:21:07] <qhong> basically you have both / and \, and they are different
[10:21:17] <qhong> (and you also need parenthesis probably)
[10:21:57] <moon-child> it feels like an invented issue to me.  But I am not quite able to see why yet
[10:22:37] <moon-child> like, there is no foo:bar:baz
[10:23:19] <qhong> foo/(bar:baz) and (foo/bar):baz is different
[10:24:04] <moon-child> what is (foo/bar):baz?
[10:24:24] <moon-child> I interpret bar:baz to mean the symbol named baz in the package named bar

[11:30:16] <moon-child> hmm.  Under the c++11 memory model (as stolen by c, scheme, llvm, perhaps also cl if bike gets his way), memory ordering is a policy which is realised twice.  It limits when the cpu can make memory accesses visible to threads, but it also limits how the compiler can reorder and remove operations
[11:30:47] <hayley> Right.
[11:31:14] <moon-child> this feels like partial affirmation of my idea that multicore-parallelism shoul dbe like ilp, but one level up: the compiler does it automatically, but you can tune to take better advantage of it
[11:31:16] <moon-child> but I'm not sure why
[11:32:06] <hayley> Same thing with how side effects are visible to the same thread, no? The processor can pipeline and reorder as it pleases, except around particular combinations that "conflict". And the compiler may do the same.

[11:55:01] <gilberth> PS is nice because it has mandated tail calls and therefore GOTO. When you construct your code vectors grammatically, you could stick an executable array right into another executable array. A pure GOTO.

[14:54:01] <lisp123> moon-child: I was thinking of doing some CLOS-style approach to record organisation

[14:55:29] <moon-child> I don't really see the point.  Or, rather, that seems orthogonal to the sort of organization that I want to enable
[14:56:20] <shka> selwyn: no, things like: do something when the topic/whatever matches regex/whatever
[14:56:25] <selwyn> right
[14:56:49] <selwyn> is there a way to manage that with multiple clients on different machines?

[14:57:50] <lisp123> moon-child: I was looking at recording "events" -> e.g. meetings / calls / etc -> a most basic event class could just 1 slot - title, then a meeting could have title, time, attendees, etc. - this way one could search across all titles, or all times etc
[14:59:06] <lisp123> what were you thinking of doing?
[14:59:54] <shka> selwyn: if your config are just files, you can synchronize those and it works
[14:59:58] <moon-child> ok.  Now you want to add a new tag so you have to go and redefine.  And what does it buy you?  Make everything a straight hash table.  You _want_ more expressiveness

[15:02:15] <shka> if you are using windows, The Bat is a shockingly good email client
[15:02:37] <kakuhen> but then there was another bug that wouldn't manifest itself until i hit a rice2 partition (since i wrongfully read 4/5 bits for the partition order while flac spec says only 4 bits are used)
[15:03:01] <kakuhen> that would throw off the encoding parameters and eventually make my decoded samples explode and signal type errors
[15:03:41] <shka> but "the bat!" is closed sources you are supposed to pay for
[15:04:52] <shka> maybe it also has version for mac, i don't know
[15:05:18] <kakuhen> ...[im so excited that i can just loop (parse-block (make-instance 'frame)) until i hit eof now]
[15:06:06] <kakuhen> my friend commented that my api is "very weird" and falls very short of being CLOS style but i guess that is my fault for rigidly following the tables given in the spec 
[15:06:40] <kakuhen> the most clos magic i do is hide header and footer parsing in before/after methods so that you dont have to worry about it
[15:07:33] <kakuhen> it makes the CCL stack traces very ugly and unhelpful, but it also means i can just (make-instance 'frame) at a sync code and iterate my way until EOF

[20:11:15] <selwyn> i am kind of worried how the usa will take losing its position as world hegemon
[20:11:59] <shka> i don't expect massive political changes
[20:12:32] <Lycurgus> the number 12 seems pulled and therefore pos
[20:13:01] <shka> financial elites will adjust, and USA despite everything else, is a highly developed nation with natural resources and large population
[20:13:18] <Lycurgus> it's funny how 'good person' is interpreted as a double negative
[20:13:36] <shka> in other words: Americans will be completely fine and they know it 
[20:13:54] <Lycurgus> for a normal objsct, good has a positive functional meaning
[20:14:05] <shka> they simply won't be able to credit as they used to
[20:14:45] <shka> also it seems that american citizens are fed up of American imperialism as well
[20:14:56] <Lycurgus> the failure of ethnogenesis if driving change in the US fueled by other factors
[20:15:26] <Lycurgus> the fact that it is rich and could be autarkic doesn't mean it's immune to change
[20:15:34] <selwyn> another aspect of contemporary america is that it likes to launch wars of choice even on a good day

[20:16:11] <shka> big part of trump victory was "no more wars" promise

[20:16:30] <Lycurgus> the thing with them only accepting rubles in payment, is that smart if fx still works and the ruble has cratered?
[20:16:45] <shka> it is even possible that they will return to isolationist policy 
[20:16:52] <Lycurgus> why wouldn't I want to pay in roubles?
[20:17:26] <shka> Lycurgus: because you don't have roubles, you need to buy them in Russia central bank, under exchange rate dictated by russian central bank
[20:17:34] <selwyn> only countries that sanctioned russia have to pay in roubles, it is not for everyone

[20:18:05] <shka> nope
[20:18:05] <Lycurgus> that would explain if so
[20:18:27] <shka> and russians can't sell roubles to buy foreign currency 
[20:18:29] <selwyn> and if you want to buy roubles from the russian central bank, then some russian banks have to be not sanctioned
[20:18:45] <Lycurgus> ah, then they've dropped out of the international system completely
[20:18:53] <shka> yeah, full USSR
[20:19:38] <Lycurgus> a currency that doesn't trade on international arbitrage markets is effectively a private national chit
[20:19:53] <shka> yes, welcome to the commie land
[20:20:07] <selwyn> shka: since the world is de-dollarising, how will us-led sanctions be able to isolate russia
[20:20:09] <Lycurgus> i think the rouble traded internationally under the soviets
[20:20:29] <shka> selwyn: well, why USA would care about Russia in next 20 years?
[20:21:07] <shka> i really think that they will become isolationist country once again 
[20:21:22] <shka> and they kinda can do that amazingly 
[20:21:25] <Lycurgus> the US, you don't live here I take it
[20:21:34] <Lycurgus> *the US?,
[20:21:47] <shka> no, i live in eastern europe 
[20:21:51] <Lycurgus> the US created the current international system
[20:22:26] <selwyn> unless i am missing something, i really can't see the logic here
[20:22:37] <Lycurgus> in some sense it is still its center although china and the eu now have equal mass
[20:22:55] <selwyn> if america becomes autarkic, and the dollar doesn't rule the world, then sanctions will be less effective and not more effective
[20:23:16] <shka> selwyn: i mean: the will to sustain the american empire is waning anyway, and if so, what is the motivation for actually carrying about europe?
[20:23:32] <selwyn> well, whats the motivation for caring about sanctions then
[20:23:47] <selwyn> why risk e.g. palladium imports for no good reason?
[20:24:07] <shka> right here, right now there is still an issue, but in next 20 years?
[20:24:46] <Lycurgus> the whole angst that is currently being expressed about the international system is based on false expectations of a US collapse 
[20:24:55] <shka> american financial empire won't collapse in one year, it will take few decades 
[20:24:59] <Lycurgus> and overestimating the impact of russia
[20:25:07] <shka> it is still alive and well now
[20:25:34] <shka> but once it falls, and i don't think this can be avoided now, what motivation is left?
[20:26:16] <Lycurgus> the thing that is changed/changing is that the US isn't basically the whole show anymore and basically has run it's course as leading nation

[20:27:08] <Lycurgus> one the US built but which ultimately grows independent of that origin
[20:27:26] <Lycurgus> just as western civilization isn't bound to the greeks
[20:27:39] <shka> selwyn: sometimes you simply have to accept the reality, that's my take, and that's what i think will happen in the future
[20:27:55] <Lycurgus> so civilization per se isn't going to be bound to western
[20:28:06] <selwyn> elites often don't like to accept reality though
[20:28:32] <shka> capital has no nationality 
[20:28:54] <selwyn> i feel that if america ever has to accept that it is #2 to china, it will go apeshit, at least at a cultural level
[20:28:59] <selwyn> and i don't know what that entails
[20:29:22] <pl> selwyn: it already had issues dealing with post-bush world
[20:29:28] <Lycurgus> actually it does, most of it, non-fiat excluded
[20:30:18] <shka> selwyn: ever heard of Trump?
[20:30:19] <Lycurgus> i'm american and I accepted it some time ago, when the PPP GDPs crossed
[20:30:25] <shka> expect more of that in the futur
[20:30:52] <shka> but I expect this to be mostly isolationist type of crazy  
[20:31:14] <Lycurgus> also the fact that the chinese aren't religious and have the largest non believer population speaks to me
[20:31:16] <pl> America started losing weight in international politics after the blunders of Bush & Cheney combo
[20:32:40] <Lycurgus> in a lot of stuff, like smoking, traditional medicine, etc, they look normal stupid
[20:32:53] <shka> can't loose wars if you don't go to wars 
[20:32:56] * shka taps head
[20:33:56] <shka> anyway, this is my opinion, i think that it holds it's ground but you are free to disagree
[20:34:18] <selwyn> shka: it makes sense actually
[20:34:18] <shka> but remember that capital has no nationality, it is a global concept
[20:34:25] <gilberth> Is there anything said about which threads gets SIGINT and SIGQUIT when generated by the tty?
[20:35:27] <Lycurgus> who would say it?

[20:35:34] -ixelp- pthreads(7) - Linux manual page
[20:35:37] <Lycurgus> signals is signals
[20:35:42] <gilberth> POSIX?
[20:35:48] <shka> gilberth: yes
[20:35:55] <selwyn> speaking of bush, i think that the memory of iraq is what is informing much analysis of ukraine and leading to incorrect thinking
[20:35:58] <shka> threads have signal masks
[20:36:33] <Lycurgus> which they set themselves (or their parent process/job does)

[20:37:29] <shka> dunno if this is standard or not
[20:38:10] <shka> selwyn: well, great power leaders also make mistakes
[20:38:15] <Lycurgus> you can do anything you want in linux, kernel builds are very highly routinized by now
[20:38:50] <shka> cesar had some military blunders, just as napoleon, and Hitler had no idea of true soviet military capability 
[20:38:51] <gilberth> Well, Linux is a special case as with Linux threads and processes are essentially the same.
[20:39:01] <shka> AFAIK soviet union was supposed to collapse in few weeks
[20:39:34] <shka> in the end, only humans
[20:39:47] <selwyn> for example, the absence of much of the russian air force is seen as a major weakness and disadvantage, because if it was the usa in charge the air force would be employed in bombing cities continuously with no regard for consequences
[20:39:54] <shka> Putin also fucked up
[20:39:56] <Lycurgus> gilberth, at some level that's true but answering that in an interview once brought down a shitload of gotcha

[20:41:08] <gilberth> Lycurgus: Well, threads are created with clone() which is just a fork() with MAP_PRIVATE turned off and this getting rid of copy-on-write. With Linux that is.
[20:41:10] <shka> selwyn: absence of russian air force is surprising because it was expected that it would be used to destroy ukrainian army before launching the real attack
[20:41:43] <selwyn> well, exactly
[20:41:49] <selwyn> they expected russia to behave like the usa
[20:41:49] <shka> but in the end it seems that they are not good at targeting ground targets actually
[20:42:17] <shka> selwyn: oh, Russians use artillery to level down the cities, don't you worry about that

[20:44:01] <shka> selwyn: don't get under impression that Russians are somehow more humane
[20:44:32] <shka> they are not, they simply don't have that much of air strike capability 
[20:45:00] <shka> primary function of air force is the air defense, not ground strikes 
[20:45:12] <shka> according to Russians at least
[20:47:07] <Lycurgus> russian has only ever done well against even more backward adversaries or when it was on defense after invasion of its core
[20:47:48] <shka> selwyn: Russian army killed 1/4 of the Chechnya population, and also Aleppo was a show of what Russians actually do
[20:47:48] <Lycurgus> its suicidal for it in it's current form to go full on against the west
[20:48:00] <Lycurgus> *russia has only
[20:48:20] <shka> it is not that they don't want to ruin Ukraine, it is just that is difficult to ship enough of ordnance to do that

[20:48:27] <selwyn> raqqa was/is the most destroyed city in syria
[20:49:16] <selwyn> at the end of the battle, some parts of aleppo were in much better state than expected
[20:49:50] <selwyn> so i don't regard it as a convincing data point of brutal russian urban tactics
[20:50:21] <Lycurgus> no one country had air supremacy in syria i take it

[20:51:25] <selwyn> would also remark that turkey did its best to ruin the city

[21:24:00] <Lycurgus> very cognitively dissonant since expected and wanted it to be the lisp thing

[22:58:41] <rotateq> maybe like for example here: https://github.com/lambdamikel/Common-Lisp-Tangram-Solver/blob/main/src/define-system.lisp

[22:59:14] <rotateq> I wanted to try porting it to SBCL and McCLIM but hmm :(
[23:00:28] <phoe> rotateq: https://github.com/lambdamikel/Common-Lisp-Tangram-Solver/blob/main/src/tangram-sysdcl.lisp
[23:00:29] -ixelp- Common-Lisp-Tangram-Solver/tangram-sysdcl.lisp at main · lambdamikel/Common-Lisp-Tangram-Solver · GitHub
[23:00:36] <phoe> looks simple enough to port I guess?
[23:00:50] <phoe> once you remove stuff like https://github.com/lambdamikel/Common-Lisp-Tangram-Solver/blob/main/src/tangram-sysdcl.lisp#L5-L6 though

[23:01:41] <rotateq> phoe: yes for you :) but I'm not yet capable/experienced enough
[23:01:56] <phoe> :D
[23:02:07] <rotateq> and then when some small important details are just in lw, acl ...
[23:02:35] <rotateq> phoe: no really, especially with asdf, but I can understand now some more of the CLIM code
