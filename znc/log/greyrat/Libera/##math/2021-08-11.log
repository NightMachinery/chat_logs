[00:17:31] <Z-module> speaking of numeric conjectures, I'd still like to know how someone allegedly checked that at least one of 3,5,7,11 divides C(2n,n)  [middle binomial coefficient] for all natural n up to 10^10000 = googol^100, with the only exceptions of 1 and 3160. Even with the Kummer's Theorem shortcut of checking that odd prime p is coprime to C(2n,n) iff all the digits of n in base p are < p/2 -- that still seems like a crazy amount of calculation.

[00:26:40] <Vornicus> also how on earth is 3160 special at all
[00:26:51] <Z-module> it's just a small fluke

[00:27:30] <river> the central binomial coefficient C(2n,n) is interesting
[00:27:41] <rubiksdream> even though 3160 is arbitrary, isnt the number of consecutive primes were checking could divide the middle coefficients arbitrary too?
[00:28:23] <rubiksdream> in that sense that fluke doesnt seem totally surprising

[00:29:49] <Z-module> but I just can't imagine how you parallelize computations enough, or whatever, to test everything like that up to googol^100
[00:30:19] <Z-module> I'm thinking this claim might even be erroneous. It's nothing but hearsay anyway.
[00:30:49] <Z-module> (the paper I saw this in gives a reference, but that reference itself says nothing other than an unspecified personal communication)
[00:31:24] <Z-module> So it's inadmissible as evidence in Z-module's Court of Criminally Wacko Conjectures.
[00:35:52] <Z-module> A somewhat broader context is: For m = product of any two distinct odd primes, infinitely many n do exist (result of Erdos et al) with C(2n,n) coprime to m. But there's no m = a product of three distinct odd primes where that's known, I gather.
[00:36:00] <cherim> Isn't this the expected outcome, and by a margin though? Even already from the quoted Kummer
[00:36:21] <Z-module> yeah, it's not numercially surprising

[00:38:41] <Z-module> (which implies the thing I said about base-p digits of C(2n,n) )
[00:38:49] <Z-module> (sorry, of n )
[00:39:12] <cherim> One can get so many true unprovable number-theoretic facts which are true probabilistically as well
[00:39:12] <Vornicus> well
[00:39:26] <cherim> Better study those which aren't...
[00:39:32] <Vornicus> kummer's theorem does filter pretty quickly, now that I think on it
[00:39:43] <qergle> so we should have that gcd(p,C(2n,n))=1 if n's digits (in base p) are all less than p/2
[00:40:30] <Z-module> yes, qergle
[00:41:34] <Vornicus> you get increasingly large stride skips
[00:42:39] <qergle> 3160 = 11100001, 100120, 12133, 2413 (in bases 3,5,7,11)

[00:45:06] <cherim> You get to check a fraction, then of them a fraction of a fraction, etc. You should look at the logarithm of the bound, not the bound itself

[00:47:24] <cherim> As I said, it's well within the probabilistic bound

[00:49:22] <Vornicus> with the right filtering you can try a number, see which one it fails, and then figure out which is the *next* number that might succeed that task.
[00:49:33] <int-e> river: if you make up new problems there's a chance one of them can actually be solved

[02:50:26] <motle> then you still get orbital complications
[02:51:13] <motle> so while bayes theory presents an easy example of a trivial monad (monadic flattening of 2 layers to 1 by bayes rule)

[02:54:51] <motle> the point is that while working with probabilities is commonly surgested, and is monadic as required, it does nothing to solve the mean field integration problem

[05:29:43] <motle> so iv thought more about this sensor placement problem. its not *just* a measure valued set
[05:30:46] <motle> the topological considerations, which im calling navigable pointers for short, mean that its the *placement* part thats important when considering "sensors" instead of just observable opperators
[05:31:22] <motle> ie, these are locationally parametric measure valued sets, which uses the pointer construction

[05:31:41] <female_student_4> Is anyone familiar with gaussian elimination?
[05:32:11] <qergle> sure
[05:32:35] <qergle> that's a rather important algorithm in applied linear algebra
[05:33:02] <female_student_4> ok
[05:33:05] <female_student_4> I have a C++ code
[05:33:19] <motle> for the chemistry problem, at the top layer, this is just the position in space of where material is located, but on the deeper layers, its supposed to give the physical properties, like the chemical structure and deep subatomic structure also using the colvolutional stencil in the topological neighbourhood
[05:33:22] <female_student_4> I don't really understand the math part of it
[05:33:38] <female_student_4> qergle https://wandbox.org/permlink/JUUBwxyTrxE6nLVw
[05:33:43] <qergle> do you know gaussian elimination using pen and paper?
[05:34:02] <female_student_4> I'm familiar with Crout and Dolitte but that's it
[05:34:33] <female_student_4> I don't understand what it is doing between lines 1 and 53
[05:34:36] <qergle> i don't know what that is. i mean can you do gaussian elimination on a matrix yourself with pencil and paper?
[05:34:40] <female_student_4> like I don't get what purpose this pivot achieve
[05:35:14] <qergle> i can't open that. can you post in a non javascript pastebin?
[05:35:34] <qergle> never mind, i'll get my pad
[05:35:39] <motle> the graph monad results from the requirement of deep structure, just points and nearest neighbours in one representation, or a rose tree, with tree zipper in another, where this second version has the required navigability canonically presented
[05:35:53] <female_student_4> qergle Can you open it?
[05:35:54] <motle> well, up to graph isomorphism, choosing the top point of the tree
[05:36:14] <qergle> female_student_4: but i'm not going to explain 53 lines of code :(
[05:36:24] <female_student_4> No I understand the code
[05:36:29] <female_student_4> I just don't understand the operation
[05:37:00] <female_student_4> For example, the first iteration is
[05:37:01] <female_student_4> /matrix [1][0] = matrix[1][0] - (matrix[0][0] * (matrix[1][0] / matrix[0][0]))
[05:37:09] <motle> like, how that is like a carry leading to the diagonalization?
[05:37:26] <female_student_4> /matrix [1][0] // matrix[0][0] = -0.1 = -1/10
[05:37:29] <qergle> female_student_4: it is zero'ing out the entries that aren't the pivot
[05:37:31] <female_student_4> Which makes the pivot
[05:37:42] <female_student_4> But what is the pivot?? Why do we need one

[05:37:59] <qergle> i think you should learn gaussian elimination on paper
[05:38:26] <qergle> you want an echelon (or staircase) pattern, so everything below the pivot is 0
[05:38:27] <int-e> motle: you seem to be mistaking this channel for a rubber duck. again.
[05:38:51] <qergle> sometimes you want above and below to be zero (reduce echelon)
[05:38:52] <female_student_4> qergle by pivot, do you mean the diagonal?
[05:38:56] <qergle> reduced*
[05:39:08] <qergle> no, by pivot i mean the leftmost non-zero entry in a row
[05:39:57] <motle> int-e: i dismissed someones suggestion before, and i was giving a belated response
[05:40:02] <female_student_4> What should the final result look like?
[05:40:12] <qergle> ok, so let's do one...
[05:40:25] <qergle> say A=[1 2 3; 1 1 2; 2 1 3]
[05:40:25] <motle> they linked this; https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.01446.pdf

[05:40:40] <female_student_4> okay
[05:40:47] <female_student_4> qergle
[05:41:17] <qergle> if you gaussian reduce that you end up with:
[05:41:27] <qergle> hrmm, let me make sure i didnt screw that up
[05:41:49] <qergle> ok [1 2 3;0 -1 -1;0 0 0]
[05:42:20] <qergle> the first pivot is the 1 on the 1st row, 2nd pivot is -1 in 2nd row, and no pivot in 3rd row
[05:42:45] <qergle> i didn't make my example smartly enough, i was shooting for 3 pivots (non-singular)
[05:43:09] <qergle> but that's not important.
[05:43:13] <female_student_4> Yeah, sounds like I don't know what gaussian elimination is
[05:43:41] <qergle> i am certain there are plenty of online things that explain the algo
[05:43:46] <motle> i wonder if perhaps LBP can unify the pdf centric approach with that of the ergodic integral, such as for the magnetic coinflips in orbit problem
[05:43:50] <qergle> probably tons of youboobs too
[05:44:13] <motle> see my car
[05:44:15] <qergle> but here's a quickie, for my made up A
[05:44:27] <female_student_4> I'm on youtube right
[05:44:28] <female_student_4> now
[05:44:32] <female_student_4> All the videos are rubbish
[05:44:33] <qergle> take row 2 and subtract row 1 and put in row 2
[05:44:52] <motle> your rushing
[05:44:52] <qergle> that gives a 0 in the leftmost position of row 2: 0 -1 -1
[05:45:20] <qergle> then take row 3 and subtract 2*row2 1: 0 -3 -3
[05:45:31] <qergle> and finally, take row 3 and subtrace 3*row 2: 0 0 0
[05:45:39] <qergle> and you're done
[05:46:12] <female_student_4> qergle okay, what is the first step generally doing
[05:46:26] <female_student_4> Like, why is it changing A and b?
[05:46:30] <qergle> <qergle> say A=[1 2 3; 1 1 2; 2 1 3]
[05:46:40] <qergle> the first step zeros out the leftmost 1 in row 2
[05:46:40] <female_student_4> I don't need the specifics really
[05:46:43] <female_student_4> I will read that up
[05:46:53] <female_student_4> Like what is the general step of altering A and b
[05:46:59] <qergle> changes row 2 from "1 1 2" to "0 -1 -1"
[05:47:27] <qergle> the first pivot is the 1 in the top left and you want everything below that to be 0
[05:48:17] <cherim> Every your line is absolutely correct but it could do more good to just send to a decent linear algebra book
[05:48:50] <cherim> It's not a thing one can skip without harm normally
[05:49:35] <qergle> i agree, i would actually invest in learning the algorith. do what cherim said female_student_4
[05:49:41] <female_student_4> Okay, but Im grazing through examples of gaussian elimination right now
[05:49:47] <female_student_4> And they all look different

[05:50:23] <female_student_4> like im reading thus
[05:50:23] <qergle> once you learn to do this with pen & paper for 2x2 and 3x3 matrices you will understand the C++ code
[05:50:25] <female_student_4> this
[05:50:28] <female_student_4> and they are all different
[05:50:38] <female_student_4> Yes, I realise that, but I'm not even sure what resource to pick out
[05:51:10] <qergle> i don't have a good resource, it's been a while since i accessed that level of stuff.
[05:51:33] <qergle> maybe lay and lay (textbook)
[05:52:02] <female_student_4> Yes, but from this resource
[05:52:04] <female_student_4> https://learn.lboro.ac.uk/archive/olmp/olmp_resources/pages/workbooks_1_50_jan2008/Workbook30/30_2_gauss_elim.pdf
[05:52:11] <female_student_4> Are they adopting methodology 1 or the partial pivoting method?
[05:52:11] <qergle> or maybe people here who have more recently learned this have a nice link to something interactive and modern :)
[05:52:21] <qergle> partial pivoting is a more advanced measure
[05:52:35] <qergle> it's meant to ensure numerical stability, you pick the largest abs value as your pivot
[05:52:39] <qergle> learn the basics first
[05:53:13] <female_student_4> Okay, I will assume they are adopting methodology 1 then
[05:53:16] <female_student_4> thank you
[05:55:11] <female_student_4> thanks, it is a lot more clear now

[13:39:33] <xormor> cherim, is there an explanation for why (1+2+..+n)^n = 1³+2³+...+n³? my gnome-calculator is proving the claim true. I am using induction: I count with different values of n and the numbers before, so that n>=2 and n is an integer, I counted up to n=10. the theorem still holds true.
[13:40:22] <xormor> not ^n but ^2
[13:40:41] <cherim> It's a correct statement and you can prove it for any n. Of course, verifying up to n=10 does not mean it will always hold
[13:41:14] <cherim> Well, in fact it does, but you need some extra argument

[16:02:16] <cherim> I know how D&C works for digits in base b, it's not that magic
[16:02:56] <cherim> Certainly not efficient enough not to look at 1000x (inthe 1000x digit range) speedup in a typical case
[16:03:08] <int-e> cherim: Oh I see what you're saying... yeah this could probably be quite a bit faster

[16:09:37] <int-e> cherim: so basically... the design decision to maintain full representations in all 4 bases (3,5,7,11) probably wasn't so smart after all, since you can easily produce the first dozen digits in all 4 bases instead, and you're (apparently, judging by the number of iterations) likely to find a skip in there.

[16:10:16] <cherim> Yes. You only need O(1) precision with logarithms
[16:10:45] <cherim> Very rarely you may need a deep computation on demand (maybe), but certainly it won't affect the typical step
[16:10:55] <int-e> OTOH, it's mostly a constant factor, though a significant one

[16:15:31] <cherim> There will be different problems related to getting even the O(1) most significant digits for high exponents reliably
[16:15:58] <cherim> But it will happen so far ahead, with logarithm being of order 1/machine_eps while it's 1e4 now
[16:16:52] <Vornicus> I was thinking about maybe caching, like, 11^n in base 3, for instance, and just doing a bunch of multiply adds on the vectors and then running the carry in one big ol' step
[16:18:46] *** Joins: oxide (~lambda@user/oxide)
[16:20:10] <int-e> The main insight I'm getting from this is that it's *okay* to work with approximations, as long as we're conservative when skipping ahead (if we can skip from n to m > n, it's also okay to skip to any number between n and m).
[16:20:41] *** qwedfg_ is now known as qwedfg
[16:20:42] <Vornicus> that I'm not sure about, mostly because one of the reasons the skip is so powerful is because they can be incredibly huge.

[16:22:04] <int-e> And we can expect that crude approximations to double floating point precision (say) will carry us most of the way, with maybe a few hard spots where we need larger precision for skips to not get stuck. (Obviously, if there is another number with gcd(C(2n,n),3*5*7*11)>1 then we'll need n in full precision)
[16:22:18] <int-e> Vornicus: that's precisely the point though
[16:22:31] <Vornicus> being conservative - only looking at like the last thousand digits - well, there's p^10 of those skips in the skip to 1010 digits
[16:22:45] <int-e> Vornicus: we look at *leading* digits
[16:23:03] <Vornicus> okay fair that does help
[16:24:15] <int-e> I'm intrigued now, I might actually implement this.

[19:50:01] <Vornicus> Okay, following along (very delayed) Keenan Crane's discrete differential geometry course from spring, working on assignment 2 about curvature, which you can find here. https://brickisland.net/DDGSpring2021/2021/03/23/assignment-2-written-investigating-curvature-due-4-6/ . One of the problems is to calculate the "shape operator" of a surface, which in the thing he calls dN, where N is the gauss map (which
[19:50:01] <Vornicus> gives the unit normal at every point on the surface).
[19:50:51] <qergle> are lectures recorded or are you following along lecture notes?
[19:51:22] <Vornicus> the lectures are all on youtube; the slides are available as well as pdfs, and there's the course notes.  Click the top there if you want those
[19:52:55] <Vornicus> Now - in the course notes (linked at the top of that page) he discusses the shape operator on page 39, and there he describes it somewhat differently: there's a linear operator S s.t. df(SX) = dN(x), and S is called the shape operator.  He calls dN here the "weingarten map", and obviously these two are somewhat different things, and indeed he points out in the notes that you should keep them separate
[19:53:17] <Guest8265> i'm rusty on all of this, the closed form for this sum is pretty simple but i can't figure out how to derive it myself: sum_{i=0}^n sum_{j=0}^n i/(i+j) = 1/2 n^2 (see: https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+sum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5En+i%2F%28i%2Bj%29)

[20:03:21] <Guest8265> is there a way to get to that same result without appealing to symmetry just via like

[20:03:46] <Guest8265> the symmetry argument is what i was looking for initially but foolishly missed
[20:04:34] <cherim> There are many ways but they will look stupid when the symmetry is there
[20:04:48] <cherim> For example, you can group by i+j
[20:05:32] <cherim> Then sum the arithmetic series in the numerator, and finally the remaining one-dimensional sum

[22:57:50] <Izem> what is a combinator? Is that only a computer science thing?

[23:19:34] <tangentstorm> Izem: it's a logic thing. a combinator is a function that doesn't rely on mutable state. i think more formally, it's something like 'a higher order function that does nothing but apply its arguments to each other in some way'.
[23:20:06] <Izem> yeah that does seem to be it, clever idea

[23:21:15] <tangentstorm> i guess in combinatory logic, there isn't really mutable state, but they say it has no 'free variables'... the definition doesn't refer to any variables other than the inputs
[23:21:45] <river> yes combinators are equivalent to closed lambda terms
[23:22:51] <Capso> nejimban: You said P[A] = E[P[A | F]] is due to the "tower property", but in my searches I'm only seeing E[X] = E[E[X | Z]]... how does the P[] version follow?

[23:28:11] <Capso> nejimban: ah, it's the "law of total probability", but basically P[A] = E[1_A] = E[E[1_A | X]] = E[P[A | X]]
