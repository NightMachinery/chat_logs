[03:27:57] <feepbot> <gwern> https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59667645 I think the worst part of this is that octopuses are the least tasty seafood I've ever eaten. they're about the last sea creatures we should be knocking ourselves out to try to factory farm on as large a scale as possible...
[03:27:58] <Robomot> The world's first octopus farm - should it go ahead? - BBC News (The world’s first commercial octopus farm is closer to becoming reality - but scientists are up in arms.)
[03:31:28] <gwern> (like, cows are pretty dang tasty. I'm a bit concerned about the morality and desirability of eating cows. but at least if it's a sin, it's a *delicious* sin. octopuses... I'm pretty sure that any recipe which uses octopus could be improved by replacing the octopus with something else, even if prepared by the greatest of chefs. so... why take the risk? also, that's money you could be spending...
[03:31:34] <gwern> ...on cow or tuna or something)
[03:32:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also, octopuses are cute, and smart. We should hire them to farm cows for us. Or tunas
[03:32:51] <gwern> anyway, I learned something crazy today while renting a steam vaccum and the UPS guy came in... to plug his phone in to recharge. apparently, UPS delivery trucks *don't have any chargers or sockets*
[03:32:55] <galambo> gwern, do you mean money or suffering points?
[03:33:08] <gwern> galambo: both. eating octopuses is just a terrible diea

[07:33:04] <quanticle> Isn't DRAM too slow to really do anything?
[07:33:46] <quanticle> The reason CPUs have so many layers of cache is that while the CPU runs at ~5GHz, DRAM has trouble even reaching 2GHz

[07:37:22] <Robomot> Error
[07:37:50] <gwern> I'm sure you've heard of Herculaneum before. it's pretty famous
[07:38:09] <gwern> like, it's on gwern.net already, just in /Red for the early printings about the art findings
[07:38:25] <gwern> it's just you didn't remember it because no one drew out the implications
[07:38:25] <quanticle> I've heard of Herculaneum (and even visited Pompeii) but this is the first I'm hearing of this library
[07:38:52] <gwern> if you visited pompeii, you must have heard of it
[07:39:24] <maplefinger> i saw a gwern-net retweet from an antivaxxer today
[07:39:31] <quanticle> Maybe? But I certainly don't remember anyone mentioning that there was this giant library which would double our collection of surviving works.
[07:39:41] <maplefinger> what's next after Ivermectin?
[07:39:44] <gwern> I think it's just one of those things that no one ever expresses bluntly even though the experts know all about it
[07:39:52] <quanticle> Yeah, must be.
[07:40:15] <quanticle> (To be fair, the tour guide was mostly focused on Pompeii, and anything from Herculaneum got a passing mention at best)
[07:40:31] <gwern> like, in 2013, the experts knew that the UKBB was coming and that the exponential growth of consumer genotyping was going to mean that in 10 years, you'd have powerful genetic predictors for *everything*
[07:40:37] <gwern> I know because they were telling me this privately
[07:41:14] <gwern> but if you just read the regular articles and media coverage, all you'd get is a _Peanuts_-style bla-bla-bla 'data is increasing, someday maybe we'll have predictors'
[07:41:51] <maplefinger> no mention of Jesus
[07:43:27] *** Quits: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage) (Quit: Leaving)
[07:46:43] <gwern> none of this was really all that controversial. there wasn't any good reason to expect the big biobank PGSes to fail, just as there's no good reason to assume that Herculaneium won't contain thousands upon thousands more scrolls if just the little bit excavated yielded 1800 scrolls. and given that our coverage is so incredibly scanty, even for figures like Aristotle we've lost a bunch of...
[07:46:49] <gwern> ...works, it defies belief that it wouldn't somehow yield a whole bunch of new works that'll rock our understanding of the past.
[07:47:23] <gwern> it's just, well, what are you gonna do about it? you just go on with life, and if the experts don't speak clearly with one voice, the laymen won't realize there's anything to realize
[07:48:48] <gwern> you could totally dramatize herculaneum in an easy to understand way. just have a big wall, filled with scroll outlines, with 1800 entries for the excavated ones, and the little individual words which have been deciphered printed inside their respective scroll outline. then have another 20,000 or so scroll outlines each marked with a '?'

[08:13:29] <gwern> quanticle: synthesizing a single specific voice is easier than transcribing all possible voices, but given how Facebook's scaling research on audio processing is going, it may be pretty soon. at least in the lab, no one necessarily wants to spend good gpus on your cheapskate mom. sorta like how neural translation and transcription was way better than you saw in google translate or youtube...
[08:13:35] <gwern> ...captioning for the longest time
[08:14:12] <gwern> it's sorta like gun ammo and gun owners. why is ammo so expensive? making ammo is a solved problem. it's just gun owners are cheapskate whiny bastards who believe in the free market only for other people
[08:14:56] <gwern> which is how the 10-year ammo 'shortage' keeps going. much the same way that scalpers 'mysteriously' keep scaling ticketmaster tickets, nvidia gpus, or nike sneakers
[08:15:56] <maplefinger> guns are a fetish for weirdos
[08:16:37] <maplefinger> worshipped cultural artefacts amd the culture of fear surrounding them
[08:16:53] <maplefinger> why would such a mindset hoard ammo, indeed?
[08:17:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> maplefinger: These takes are slightly too normie for this channel, sorry
[08:17:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> You need to be approximately 20% more contrarian to be in here
[08:17:35] <adiabatic> "slightly" is a nice way to put it

[08:18:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, well, I'm an extremely nice person, as is known
[08:18:28] <maplefinger> sorry are we operating under the principle that Stephen Paddock types are normal supply and demand, or
[08:18:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Who or what is a Stephen Paddock

[08:23:11] * quanticle whispers to himself, "Jesus Christ, not here too"
[08:23:14] <adiabatic> yeah, owning guns got super popular last year
[08:23:31] <feep> quanticle what are you whispering you sussy baka
[08:24:06] <feep> ... that's all the memes I picked up the past two years
[08:24:55] <feep> guns are a fetish for weirdos
[08:25:05] <feep> and this is a channel for weirdos with odd fetishes, what's your point
[08:25:08] <quanticle> Which makes them perfect for this channel!
[08:25:14] <feep> exactly XD
[08:25:26] <quanticle> Yeah, we have bona-fide *catgirls* here
[08:25:37] <quanticle> Gun nuts are almost embarrassingly normie by comparison
[08:25:47] <feep> well I will grant
[08:25:52] <maplefinger> owning firearms isn't the fetish
[08:25:57] <feep> usually catgirls and gun nuts are not seen on one spectrum?
[08:26:00] <maplefinger> owning tons of them and stockpiling ammo is
[08:26:01] <feep> maybe they are
[08:26:05] <maplefinger> as was the original subject
[08:26:14] <maplefinger> <gwern> which is how the 10-year ammo 'shortage' keeps going
[08:26:15] <quanticle> feep: I've seen enough anime Twitter avatars to contest that claim!
[08:26:38] <feep> right, I think that's to some extent a side effect of the politicization of trans
[08:26:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> What's the point of having guns if you don't have ammo for them
[08:27:00] <feep> like, the left politicizing trans as a left thing is actually harmful for unconventional gender expression
[08:27:02] <maplefinger> yeah when I said "borderline"
[08:27:09] <quanticle> feep: No, no, I meant that like... there are surprisingly large number of anime Twitter avatars who are gun nuts
[08:27:28] <quanticle> Which is like... the opposite of what you were saying w.r.t. the politicization of trans
[08:27:44] <feep> mh
[08:27:47] <feep> fair enough
[08:28:51] <feep> but I think it's more like... okay, on one level twitter being twitter, with cute girl avatars being just a local thing in some subcultures, and in another just being a left attempt to politicize that expression space *failing*, but then of course I can't cite it as evidence
[08:28:58] <quanticle> It's funny, you have some dude with an adorable K-On avatar or something posting photos of his black rifle
[08:29:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Catgirls with assault rifles
[08:29:21] <feep> you could see the same thing with the animemes/goodanimemes fluff about "traps"
[08:29:28] <quanticle> If I ever get a black rifle, I will 100% put a K-On sticker on it
[08:29:37] <quanticle> Just like... on general principle
[08:29:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: What's a goodanimeme
[08:29:43] <feep> which was a leftist attempt to exert power in an anime space that just failed

[08:29:59] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: goodanimemes = animemes but you can say "traps"
[08:30:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> uhh
[08:30:33] <feep> um, which is an anime slang term for androgynous guys crossdressing as girls
[08:30:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> I know that!
[08:30:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's the "animemes" part that's confusing me
[08:30:53] <quanticle> maplefinger: You do realize that, given the fact that there are only two commercial manufacturers of ammunition in the United States, even a modest increase in ammunition purchases will lead to widespread shortages, right? This is just like the great TP shortage of 2020.
[08:30:54] <feep> o, it's a subreddit
[08:30:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> ohhh
[08:31:17] <maplefinger> quanticle not really because I'm neither hoarding, nor shooting a bunch of it
[08:31:30] <maplefinger> why would the relative availability be a concern?
[08:31:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then what do you care, lol
[08:31:54] <quanticle> This isn't a few people filling their basements with crates and crates of ammo, this is millions of people buying one or two extra boxes
[08:32:06] <quanticle> Just like with toilet paper
[08:32:11] <maplefinger> it's a direct litmus test for "I own guns to protect myself" vs "I fantasize about defending myself from the rest of my country, hell I'll go on offense to prove it"
[08:32:28] <quanticle> And once again, why do you care?
[08:32:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Buying an extra box of ammo is a litmus test for that...?
[08:32:41] <maplefinger> know anything about mass shooters?
[08:33:00] <quanticle> I know enough that I'm not afraid of them
[08:33:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> What is buying an extra package of toilet paper a litmus test for? Fantasizing about extending Halloween to last the whole year?
[08:33:10] <maplefinger> 'Buying an extra box of ammo" is suddenly introducing a sensible middleground where previously the options were "hoard" or "have no ammo"
[08:33:27] <quanticle> Why is that a problem?
[08:33:48] <maplefinger> because, as I've said several times, hoarders are a mindset and not a problem until they start shooting
[08:33:58] <maplefinger> it's likely BPD
[08:34:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> So let's get this straight
[08:34:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> 1. You saw that there is an ammo shortage
[08:34:18] <maplefinger> "I gotta buy all the ammo for this reason:  ___[fear]___"
[08:34:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2. You incorrectly concluded that this was because of hoarders
[08:34:48] <maplefinger> how's that incorrect?
[08:34:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> 3. You then diagnosed these alleged (entirely imaginary) hoarders with BPD
[08:34:59] <maplefinger> a ten-year long shortage
[08:35:08] <maplefinger> :)
[08:35:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> maplefinger: Did you read what quanticle wrote at all
[08:35:16] <maplefinger> reaal Obama hours
[08:35:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> wat
[08:35:38] <maplefinger> citation needed <quanticle> This isn't a few people filling their basements with crates and crates of ammo, this is millions of people buying one or two extra boxes
[08:36:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Citation more needed on that than "it's hoarders with BPD"...?
[08:36:06] <maplefinger> gun sales rocketed when Obama got elected, didn't you know?
[08:36:16] <quanticle> No. What needs the citation is your assertion that this ammo shortage is due to "hoarders" who are prepping to "go on offense" to "defend their country"
[08:36:28] <quanticle> You're just dropping non-sequitirs now
[08:36:40] <PlanckWalk> Can we go back to the catgirls?
[08:36:44] <quanticle> Like, do you have an actual argument, or are you just interested in getting validation for your talking points?
[08:36:45] <maplefinger> not really, that's what the hyper gun-focused lifestyles are all about
[08:37:00] <pompolic> i just got back from vrchat
[08:37:08] <pompolic> a bunch of catgirls were hunting ghosts with pistols
[08:37:08] <maplefinger> quanticle reveals:  There are no such things as hypotheses.  These are talking points
[08:37:34] <maplefinger> here's a "talking point:"  "This isn't a few people filling their basements with crates and crates of ammo, this is millions of people buying one or two extra boxes" 
[08:37:52] <maplefinger> Paddock clearly had something wrong with his mind, and there's a lot of people like him :)
[08:38:12] <maplefinger> If you've ever seen a private weapons collection, you don't need me to substantiate that
[08:38:37] <pompolic> do you have a claim that's not backed by "trust me bro"
[08:38:50] <quanticle> You've go a corkboard with a Paddock, ammo shortage, Obama, and a whole bunch of red string, but you still haven't stated what you're trying to convince me of.
[08:38:57] <maplefinger> sure I'll find Paddock's buying info

[08:42:02] <quanticle> Well, I know I have attention-deficit, but borderline personality disorder is a new one. You'll have to run that past my psychiatrist.
[08:42:23] <maplefinger> "the shortage is from people who just love shooting other people, or at least, practicing to do so"  nah no BPD detected lol
[08:42:27] <PlanckWalk> What is the hypothesis that yu're asking us to update toward, and why does one person shootting 500 rounds provide evidence for it?
[08:42:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> maplefinger: What's wrong with practicing to shoot other people
[08:42:41] <Robomot> [Astral Codex Ten] Addendum To "No Evidence" Post - https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/addendum-to-no-evidence-post
[08:42:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> maplefinger: That's exactly the kind of shooting you need practice for!
[08:42:56] <nshepperd2> In 2018, the total ammunition production for the United States was estimated at 8.7 billion rounds.
[08:43:05] <PlanckWalk> (500 rounds seriously is next to nothing)
[08:43:08] <maplefinger> Obormot\Arcturus probably expending tens of thousands of rounds a year in some male fantasy to murder?
[08:43:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's obviously way more important to practice shooting people than to practice shooting non-people

[08:43:53] <quanticle> Obormot\Arcturus: Well, practicing to shoot non-people is important too! You need to bring down that deer in one shot otherwise it'll be a real pain in the butt to track it down.
[08:43:54] <PlanckWalk> 500 rounds in *at least one* weekend.
[08:44:27] <maplefinger> I might shoot once per year
[08:44:29] <PlanckWalk> Plus it's seriously bad karma to maim your game rather than kill it quickly and cleanly.
[08:44:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Sure but I'm just saying, if you can't shoot the deer, eh, you at worst will miss a meal or couple, but if you can't shoot a person, well, that might be trouble
[08:44:44] <maplefinger> PlanckWalk always torture your enemies
[08:44:53] <PlanckWalk> Err what?
[08:44:56] <maplefinger> never kill first shot

[08:45:06] <PlanckWalk> Who was the BPD in here?  I'm losing track.
[08:45:11] <maplefinger> you can get the real truth out of them that way
[08:45:14] <quanticle> Yeah, that's fair. If I shoot a deer and miss, well, the bullet goes into the ground or into a tree. If I aim to shoot a person and miss, the bullet goes into the innocent bystander behind him.
[08:45:29] <maplefinger> PlanckWalk - anyone advocating hoarding ammo for like ten years straight
[08:45:43] <maplefinger> it's either their business or they are in some psychotic fear headspace
[08:45:43] <PlanckWalk> Or ... always torturing their enemies?
[08:45:55] <maplefinger> why's that bad?  I do that without firearms.
[08:46:12] <quanticle> And... is there anyone here who is advocating hoarding ammo at all, much less for ten years straight? As far as I can tell, you're making claims about people who aren't here.

[08:47:49] <maplefinger> yes, but there's a real shortage, no?
[08:47:55] <quanticle> And you turned that into... this weird conversation about mass shooters and borderline personality disorder
[08:48:01] <maplefinger> and there are lots of people and a whole culture hyping guns in the US, no?
[08:48:03] <quanticle> No, that's his point!
[08:48:07] <quanticle> There is no shortage
[08:48:13] <nshepperd2> no his people is that there isn't a 'shortage'
[08:48:26] <quanticle> The perception of a shortage only exists because people aren't willing to pay the market price for ammunition
[08:48:52] <quanticle> And I said, the same thing can be said of toilet paper in March of 2000
[08:48:59] <quanticle> Er, March of 2020
[08:49:10] <maplefinger> toilet paper price didnt spike then
[08:49:20] <quanticle> It should have!
[08:49:22] <feep> yes exactly
[08:49:29] <quanticle> Just like the price of ammo ought to have spiked too
[08:49:31] <maplefinger> is this a critique of capitalism somehow?
[08:49:36] <feep> that's why they ran out, prices *can't* spike, they're not *allowed" to spike
[08:49:48] <nshepperd2> no, the opposite, it's "capitalism good actually"
[08:49:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's a critique of socialism
[08:49:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Obviously
[08:49:57] <feep> well, it's "scalping is good actually"
[08:50:03] <maplefinger> lol
[08:50:11] <feep> d**
[08:50:27] <maplefinger> I am all for guntards scapling each other into bankruptcy over ammo, go for it.  I hereby retire all arguments to this effect
[08:50:36] <feep> that's .... a take
[08:50:46] <nshepperd2> that doesn't even make sense
[08:50:56] <quanticle> feep: Though, I do wonder... ammunition isn't considered an essential good like toilet paper, and therefore isn't subject to anti-gouging laws.
[08:51:07] <quanticle> So why haven't ammo prices spiked?
[08:51:07] <nshepperd2> if you're going bankrupt from buying too much ammo you have a dril problem
[08:51:08] <maplefinger> no, it's a rational position.  If you don't have enough ammo and are wasting it, hit the hip or go empty barreled
[08:51:24] <feep> quanticle: yeah idk why it doesn't happen, maybe the idea that you *can* raise prices short-term is just not in the cultural playbook of stores
[08:51:31] <maplefinger> real capitalism blames the customer
[08:51:50] <feep> the take is the idea that prices would rise to the level of being a financial issue
[08:51:57] <feep> it seems very hah, gottem
[08:52:32] <maplefinger> sorry is deconstruction considered an outside novelty here
[08:52:32] <feep> maybe generally turn the level of gottemness about 40% down?
[08:52:48] <quanticle> maplefinger: I'm sorry, were you deconstructing? 
[08:53:01] <nshepperd2> im sorry, deconstruction is a capital crime here
[08:53:02] <maplefinger> nobody noticed
[08:53:15] <pompolic> feep: grasping the gottem knob like "goteeeeem"
[08:53:15] <maplefinger> oh well, see you next alt, then
[08:53:17] <feep> at least until you figure out what sort of people are valid to dunk on in this space
[08:53:24] <feep> ie. copenhagen theorists and dualists
[08:53:30] <PlanckWalk> CDTers
[08:53:39] <feep> oh definitely
[08:53:40] <quanticle> Frequentists
[08:53:41] <maplefinger> PlanckWalk you're smarter than that
[08:54:14] <feep> ........... huh?
[08:54:37] <nshepperd2> it is indeed the customer's choice to either pay money for ammo or go on the internet and whine about a shortage
[08:54:49] <feep> maplefinger are you about to take a valiant stand for consequentialist decision theory because I am here for it
[08:55:14] <quanticle> Consequentialist decision theory, as opposed to timeless decision theory?
[08:55:28] <feep> as opposed to evidential decision theory really
[08:55:30] <nshepperd2> as opposed to deontological decision theory? lool
[08:55:37] <feep> tdt isn't really on anyone's roadmap outside this space
[08:55:44] <quanticle> I also like how you all left out the biggest group that we dunk on
[08:55:46] <pompolic> have done DDT before
[08:55:47] <quanticle> Javascript devs
[08:55:53] <pompolic> bad idea
[08:56:07] <feep> but then, like half of philosophers still assert that two-boxing is *correct*
[08:56:12] <pompolic> quanticle: feep said "people" to be fair

[08:56:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: *causal*
[08:56:36] <feep> oh oops, yes
[08:56:38] <feep> sorry!
[08:57:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway personally I am a virtue-ethical decision theorist
[08:57:02] <feep> maplefinger: for causal decision theory*
[08:57:18] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: ah, normie tdt, good tast5e
[08:57:19] <feep> taste*
[08:57:32] <pompolic> CDT's issue is with newcomblike problems right
[08:57:36] <feep> yes
[08:57:40] <pompolic> kk
[08:57:41] <nshepperd2> evidential decision theory gets a bad rap imo, bc people talking about it usually implicitly assume the decision theorist is drunk and unable to tell the difference between experiment and reality
[08:57:47] <pompolic> just making sure i understand the basics
[08:57:54] <maplefinger> feep probably not
[08:57:58] <feep> well, honestly I think cdt is salvageable
[08:58:13] <maplefinger> why would someone endorse a "decision theory"
[08:58:16] <feep> if you conceive of deciding systems as existing in a platonic space
[08:58:18] <maplefinger> seems made up

[09:33:00] <saturn2> libgen.rs
[09:33:35] <feep> trying to find a book online will definitely not get you banned here
[09:33:47] <Shelby> nah nothing

[09:34:50] <Shelby> non fiction id say
[09:35:17] <Shelby> hmm i thought buckminster fuller was more popular famous
[09:35:46] <Shelby> his physical books are hard af to find though given he is a bit eclectic i suppose and died in the 80s
[09:37:30] <quanticle> Yeah, books from the '70s, '80s and '90s are hard, because they're not so old as to be out of copyright, but they predate digitization, so people can't jailbreak epubs of them and put them online. 
[09:37:46] <quanticle> Someone has to go through the trouble of scanning and OCR-ing a physical text
[09:39:23] <saturn2> looks like it's on google books
[09:40:57] <quanticle> That's not helpful if you want the entire book, though
[09:41:09] <quanticle> Doesn't Google books only show you a sample of the pages?

[18:37:21] <gwern> quanticle: my point is more 'scalping is bad because it results in a huge waste of collective effort, unnecessary transactions, security theater, and indirection, producing semi-random results, distributing surplus to middlemen rather than producers (thereby crippling investment in production), all to achieve what could be done efficiently at the stroke of a pen by the producers or by an...
[18:37:27] <gwern> ...auction; this is, however, downstream of the fundamental problem of anti-market biases by consumers which are not merely harmful but perversely, themselves produce the exact problems they accuse the 'market' of creating in the first place'
[18:38:05] <gwern> the prices of ammo *has* risen. it's just that you now pay the true high prices on sketchy one-man websites run by the people who swoop into walmart to snipe the deliveries at the pseudo-price and resell it at the true market-clearing price
[18:38:43] <gwern> the difference is that the scalpers receive the surplus as the payment for their (unnecessary) make-work, instead of going to the manufacturers who could, say, invest in ammo factories
[18:39:06] <gwern> and so the 10-year 'shortage' continues. much like the annual famine in North Korea which mysteriously stops precisely at the yalu river and the dmz
[18:40:29] <gwern> and frustratingly, no one seems to read the annual headlines about 'politicians vow to crack down on pricegouging scalpers' and think, 'ammo has been manufactured for half a millennium. people make it in their basement. how can there possibly *still* be a shortage a decade+ later? what are they making the bullets with, Unobtanium shipped in from Alpha Centauri and the space-dragons have been...
[18:40:35] <gwern> ...eating the shipments?'
[18:41:45] <gwern> 'so taylor swift's tickets have been scalped. *again*. huh. how mysterious. I guess in 2021 we are unable to use the advanced space alien technology called "auctions". I wonder how people were able to use auctions back before 500BC? they must have been geniuses compared to us'

[19:05:26] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd: what if the length of the sample text is smaller than the context length - what should the prompt contain? should it be left padded? If so, do I need to correct for that, and if so, how would I?
[19:09:31] <nshepperd> prompt? is this a encoder decoder model
[19:10:03] <PapuaHardyNet> no, it is an autoregressive model though
[19:10:26] <PapuaHardyNet> it is an aMLP - so not a transformer or an encoder-decoder architecture
[19:11:06] <nshepperd> are you saying it has two inputs though? an autoregressive part and a conditioning? or sth
[19:11:54] <PapuaHardyNet> no no, just one input - a batch (because vmapped) of inputs to the model of sequence length, which then returns an output of sequence length
[19:12:25] <nshepperd> if it's autoregressive unconditional you just right pad the tokens and mask the losses to not include the padded part
[19:12:43] <PapuaHardyNet> you did say that, yeah, but I didn't get it
[19:13:05] <nshepperd> as in, you fill the input from the left with tokens
[19:13:19] <nshepperd> then fill the rest with some placeholder
[19:14:54] <nshepperd> and then instead of summing over the entire sequence length for the training loss, only sum over the first part that actually had tokens
[19:15:16] *** Joins: voltage (voltage@user/voltage)
[19:15:21] <PapuaHardyNet> so when it comes to the output, you have ABXXX as input, and your expected output is XXCDE?

[19:15:24] <two2thehead> kuudes, what's the tl;dr on your omicron link?
[19:15:24] *** voltage is now known as voltage_
[19:15:47] <PapuaHardyNet> Because I'm a bit confused about how outputs work now
[19:15:51] <nshepperd> you have ABCXXX
[19:16:14] <nshepperd> and your expected output is BCDXXX
[19:16:21] <PapuaHardyNet> I thought what we do is send a prompt of length seq_len to a model who wants input of seq_len, and we get a continuation of seq_len
[19:17:03] <PapuaHardyNet> I see! I find it rather strange though
[19:17:38] <PapuaHardyNet> are we training the model to ignore the right padded tokens? is that the plan?
[19:17:42] <nshepperd> actually sometimes people prepend a fixed 'start' token to the input to make it line up better
[19:18:20] <nshepperd> like you have input SABCDXXX
[19:18:51] <nshepperd> and expected output ABCDXXXX
[19:19:25] <PapuaHardyNet> oh, that's what Gurkenglas was talking about when he said that the GPT models use something like a "one-off" encoding
[19:19:29] <nshepperd> each output is a prediction of the next token
[19:19:41] <PapuaHardyNet> that's actually quite brilliant
[19:20:20] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd, *this* is the mistake I was making! I thought, the input should be ABCDEFG, and the output should be HIJKLMNO
[19:20:43] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[19:20:52] <PapuaHardyNet> clearly I should either have a ABCDEFX -> ABCDEFG, or ABCDEFG -> BCDEFGH
[19:21:30] <nshepperd> it is very important that it works like this for training efficiently
[19:22:07] <nshepperd> because SABCDXXX -> ABCDXXXX gives you four predictions at once
[19:22:15] <nshepperd> not just one
[19:22:24] <nshepperd> like four next token predictions
[19:22:35] <nshepperd> which you then average the loss over
[19:23:01] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, so I should go for the SABCD method, not the incorrect one I used, and not the ABCDX one, which is wasteful
[19:23:03] <nshepperd> and that makes the gradients much less noisy
[19:24:33] <PapuaHardyNet> thanks a lot, super valuable. I was reconsidering whether everything I did until now was sensible or not due to this incorrect understanding I had
[19:24:56] <PapuaHardyNet> I'll probably use '\0' for both start token, and end of text token
[19:25:09] <Gurkenglas> Why not have ABCDXXX->ABCDEFG? (because it'd be difficult to hide the C from the AB?) it seems strange to force the residual to change from B to C
[19:25:15] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[19:25:20] <kuudes> \0 as start sounds problematic for C users
[19:26:02] <PapuaHardyNet> kuudes: oh, I'm byte-tokenizing it, so as an array it shall be [1, 0, ....]
[19:26:34] <nshepperd> also you average over only the first four losses in that case so effectively the model never actually sees the padding
[19:26:36] <PapuaHardyNet> that array is the start token and the end of text token I believe worth using
[19:26:52] <Gurkenglas> i suppose the residual has to change from *something* to C. suddenly it seems reasonable to have encoder and decoder stacks next to each other.
[19:27:00] <nshepperd> like the gradients don't depend on it, it doesn't matter what the padding is
[19:28:13] <Gurkenglas> meaning, to have the prompt residuals hang around to be tweaked in whatever direction is most useful for processing while a second set of residuals is slowly prepared for unembedding
[19:28:16] <PapuaHardyNet> right. I'm still a bit confused about the same thing Gurkenglas asked though
[19:28:45] <nshepperd> ABCDXXX->ABCDEFG doesn't make sense
[19:28:53] <Gurkenglas> how so?
[19:29:01] <nshepperd> it would be generating the E F G independently
[19:29:26] <nshepperd> which means you would get nonsense
[19:29:40] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, but that assumption only holds for encoder-decoder models, right?
[19:29:48] <Gurkenglas> hmm. at training time you would never have any X
[19:29:55] <nshepperd> The prediction for G needs to depends on the fact that the previous token was F
[19:30:23] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, you make intuitive sense
[19:30:39] * pompolic reads scrollback
[19:30:42] <pompolic> AJAB though
[19:30:50] <nshepperd> lmao
[19:30:50] <pompolic> especially phil torres
[19:30:51] <PapuaHardyNet> after all, if you send an input, surely the output should be *the next token*, assuming you have a context length of only 1
[19:31:10] <pompolic> also this is not epistemically legit but he's fuckin extinction rebellion
[19:31:24] <Gurkenglas> at generation time you would compute the E from the ABCD, copy the E down, and then calculate the F-column
[19:31:32] <pompolic> that is to say, i saw ~strong ties~ when i looked into his aeon article/bio
[19:31:55] <pompolic> and the epistemically suspect part i think is writing off everything XR says
[19:32:27] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, I still think that maybe ABCDX -> ABCDE holds water. Even so, since the SABCD method is more efficient re: training, that's probably what I'll go with
[19:32:36] <nshepperd> The purpose of autoregressive models is to model the probability of a string P("cat") as P(c) P(a|c) P(t|ca)
[19:32:51] <nshepperd> it is a factorized distribution
[19:32:57] <Gurkenglas> sure
[19:34:15] <PapuaHardyNet> oh yeah, then a language model with one token context length, should take one token, and then return the probability distribution of all the next tokens, not of the token given to it
[19:34:38] <PapuaHardyNet> s/all the next tokens/all the candidate tokens that could be the next token/
[19:35:37] <nshepperd> The start token method does instead P(c|S) P(a|Sc) P(t|Sca)
[19:35:52] <nshepperd> which is equivalent because you always start with S
[19:36:10] *** Joins: schmudde (~schmudde@216.169.6.249)
[19:36:12] <Gurkenglas> what i'm worried about is that the residual that turns into C has to start from B rather than starting from something default. it's weird that the embedding and unembedding matrices are transposes of one another, right?
[19:36:19] <nshepperd> but more uniform bc all of the probs are now conditional
[19:37:09] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas here is talking about a unit of the autoregressive model that computes the next token, adding a residual to the output before returning it, 
[19:37:11] <feep> "P(c|S) P(a|Sc) P(t|Sca), also known as Bayes' Rule..."
[19:37:17] <PapuaHardyNet> where a residual is simply the original input token
[19:37:35] <nshepperd> i have no idea what Gurkenglas is talking about
[19:38:24] <PapuaHardyNet> so in a gMLP model that I've implemented, we add the input array to the output before returning it
[19:38:52] <two2thehead> kuudes, finally read that thread and related ones
[19:38:59] <two2thehead> :-/
[19:39:04] <PapuaHardyNet> this is what he calls adding the residual
[19:39:05] <nshepperd> it will probably learn to cancel out the input array
[19:39:17] <nshepperd> if your training loss is correct
[19:39:49] <Gurkenglas> yeah but we want to make its job as easy as possible so it's easier to interpret later.
[19:40:32] <nshepperd> that is just what resnets do
[19:40:46] <PapuaHardyNet> oh, so this is standard practice? I did not know that
[19:41:00] <PapuaHardyNet> oh god, I need to study resnets
[19:42:09] <nshepperd> if you're saying you add the input one hots to the logits, that sounds very silly and you probably shouldn't do it
[19:42:40] <nshepperd> but yes resnets are a thing

[21:43:10] <kiboneu> it is a magstim 200
[21:43:15] <kiboneu> someone found in a basement
[21:43:34] <two2thehead> kiboneu, that is... not what I'd call 'well sourced' :V
[21:44:03] <kiboneu> i did a series of tests on inanimate object and oscilloscopes
[21:44:49] <kiboneu> in the lab we got to take empty red bull cans and shoot them w/ 4 tesla pulses -- the force would be so sudden the jerk end up crushing the can before it propels further in the air
[21:45:29] <aweinstock> this thing? https://sportsciencesafety.stir.ac.uk/files/2020/09/magstim2002_userMan.pdf
[21:45:30] <kiboneu> and we made a helmet out of a parabolic lamp ficture by denting it with the tms machine
[21:45:31] <Robomot> PDF (34 pages; 3.5 MB) - (Microsoft Word - Magstim 200\262 Operating Manual 3001-23-04.doc) (jo.lewis)
[21:45:33] <two2thehead> "The Magstim® 200² is a versatile, reliable, simple-to-use simulator for single-pulse stimulation" hm
[21:45:42] <kiboneu> aweinstock: that's the newer version
[21:46:27] <kiboneu> but seriously
[21:46:53] <kiboneu> out of all things i've done to my head, this has even more of a seemingly lasting anti-focus effect then most
[21:47:59] <kiboneu> so... not doing that for a while, until i get my hands on an rTMS machine with a butterfly 8 wand
[21:48:16] <galambo> OK I bought lots of canned food in anticipation of omicron
[21:48:24] <two2thehead> \O/
[21:48:33] <gwern> aren't you a doctor who goes to work surrounded by death and illness?
[21:48:47] <galambo> gwern, I still need to eat
[21:49:05] <gwern> yeah but it's pretty obvious at this point that the stores aren't going to just run out of food
[21:49:27] <kiboneu> it's a bad sign if a doctor surrounded by death and illness is building a wooden ship you know
[21:49:40] <gwern> you can just buy food like a normal human being. your exposure to covid is so maxed out that going to the supermark doesn't move your microcovid needle
[21:50:21] <galambo> gwern, ah I get what you mean. I order my food online so I dont go to the supermarket either way
[21:50:50] <galambo> I have a store nearby but it doesnt have as many options as online
[21:51:10] <kiboneu> cpi might go up again
[21:51:11] <PapuaHardyNet> so it wasn't in anticipation of omicron, it was a regular grocery refuel
[21:51:12] <kiboneu> i guess
[21:51:28] <gwern> kiboneu: but stocking up on canned goods has a big hedonic penalty
[21:51:28] <galambo> canned food is cheap and doesnt taste bad at all. its a no brainer cheap hedge in case supply chains do get affected at some point or I have to self isolate for a prolonged period
[21:51:46] <PapuaHardyNet> makes sense
[21:52:46] <galambo> gwern, canned food isnt that bad imo. though I tend to sprinkle msg and hot sauce to make the food more delicious
[21:52:57] <kiboneu> (loading "hedonic_motivations.html" into brain from wikipedia.org)
[21:54:40] <kiboneu> gwern: ah, i understand. over-exercising fear-avoiding habits from stimuli offered by the environment, which leads to higher predictability and future behvaior of the same sort

[22:04:43] <feepbot> <gwern> 'For instance, government officials such as district magistrates had great authority to carry out court orders, collect taxes, and implement central government policies, all of which provided “the greatest opportunity for the rapid accumulation of wealth” Chang (1962, p.7). In fact, Ni and Van (2006) estimate that circa 1873, officials’ corruption income was 14–22
[22:04:43] <feepbot> times greater than their regular income, resulting in combined earnings of about 5000 taels of silver per year (Chang, 1962) and placing about 22 percent of the agricultural output in the hands of around 0.4 percent of the population (Ni and Van, 2006).9 Even candidates who passed only the lowest level (district) examination became members of the lower gentry, which was associated
[22:04:43] <feepbot> with considerable privileges, prestige, and income (Chang, 1955, 1962; Elman, 1990, 2000; Glahn, 1996). The title of Shengyuan or Xiucai gave these individuals access to three important sources of income for this Chinese elite: the management of local affairs, secretarial assistantships to officials, and teaching (Chang, 1962). They were also exempt from corporal punishment and
[22:04:48] <feepbot> corvée (i.e., forced labor), and had the right to wear a scholar’s robes. Although the gentry class comprised only about 2 percent of the population, they received about 24 percent of the national income (Chang, 1962).'
[22:29:32] <catern> nice i got an offer that was what I was going to negotiate for and ask for
[22:30:09] <catern> it surprised me so much that I wasn't able to negotiate on the call, but certainly I will take this evidence and ask for even more

[23:27:11] <catern> Ralith: we were wrong, I definitely shouldn't have opened first and I'm glad I didn't
[23:27:18] <catern> since they offered what I was going to open with
[23:27:27] <catern> patio11 is right after all
[23:27:33] <catern> never say a number first
[23:30:38] <galambo_> did you guys find any interesting blogs or newsletters recently?

[23:39:39] <Ralith> catern: well, opening first being a good idea is conditional on having accurate knowledge, which it sounds like you didn't
[23:39:43] <Ralith> congrats on making the right call

[23:55:06] <catern> right
[23:55:38] <catern> but I thought I had accurate knowledge and I didn't so, outside view, patio11 is right
[23:56:22] <catern> um, I don't know if "outside view" is relevant but anyway, this is evidence that thinking you have accurate knowledge is not strong evidence that you do
[23:56:56] <kiboneu> catern: is this w.r.t. pricing / negotiations?
