[02:26:40] <sonny> heh, when I learned the real reason behind null I was stunned

[02:27:30] <[itchyjunk]> huh, i have no idea why null was was implemented
[02:28:05] <c2a1> I thought null was always 0
[02:28:15] <sonny> well, null as 0 means a hardware trap
[02:28:15] <c2a1> sonny: what is the real reason
[02:28:37] <ArahaelNethacker> c2a1: Only in the C standard.  It isn't necessarily actually zero.
[02:28:52] <c2a1> Ok
[02:29:00] <c2a1> Well in other languages idk
[02:29:17] <sub0> [itchyjunk] you could also have written it like this:  map (\x -> (x, fizzbuzz x)) [1 .. 10]. perhaps easier to come up with for someone new, and more likely to need something similar in the future

[02:30:15] <ArahaelNethacker> c2a1: I'm referring to the machine level - it might not actually be zero.  In C, if you compare a pointer with zero, the compiler is required to do the proper checks.
[02:30:16] <[itchyjunk]> it's anynomous function
[02:30:20] <sub0> yeah
[02:31:22] <sonny> so it was a easy way to check for a legal pointer

[05:09:54] <oldlaptop> Perhaps something like (speaking sqlite for brevity): `CREATE TABLE "membership" ("id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, "slug", "type", "amount"); CREATE TABLE "stripe_membership" ("id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES "membership", "price_id");`

[05:56:14] <quazimodo> > provider column + separate tables for each provider this will probably be the way you'll end up going otherwise you're going to either pigeon hole 'sort of related' concepts into unified columns, or you'll have sparse tables
[05:56:23] <Guest313> Is this correct? https://dpaste.org/f4XG
[05:56:25] <bayaz> Title: dpaste/f4XG (Plain Code) 
[05:57:06] <quazimodo> it looks like a reasonable enough start
[05:57:31] <quazimodo> we tend to have 'id' columns for all of our tables except for pure join tables & other very specialised tables
[05:57:39] <quazimodo> 'id' pkey columns that is
[05:57:47] <quazimodo> otherwise yeah you could go with something like that
[05:58:09] <Guest313> yea there are id columns behind the scenes and username is a fk to the user table
[05:58:28] <Guest313> sparse tables? So much vocabulary for me to learn.
[05:58:46] <quazimodo> a leaky abstraction is unfortunately the all too common phenomenon where a real world circumstances cause different 'members' of an abstraction to have different enough implementations that the abstraction starts to break
[05:59:17] <quazimodo> well i'm not using 'sparse table' in it's strictly correct usage
[05:59:39] <Guest313> what does it mean though?
[05:59:47] <quazimodo> in this case, i mean 'tables that are sparsely populated'
[05:59:56] <quazimodo> as in lots of columns that are /usually/ null
[06:00:12] <Guest313> ahh
[06:00:23] <Guest313> so you are saying that is bad to have a lot of null columns?
[06:00:43] <quazimodo> in many ways i would say it i
[06:00:45] <quazimodo> *it is
[06:00:50] <Guest313> wow
[06:00:54] <quazimodo> SQL Server is interesting
[06:00:59] <CoJaBo> lol, I've got entire databases that are mostly collections of nulls
[06:01:11] <quazimodo> they have this thing called sparse column which is very optimised for columns that are usually null
[06:01:31] <quazimodo> not because it's a great idea, but in my opinion because enterprise devs are knuckleheads
[06:01:32] <Guest313> Damn so I should really restructure my whole database then
[06:01:48] <quazimodo> in certain circumstances it's bad
[06:01:51] <CoJaBo> quazimodo: Can confirm, am enterprise dev
[06:02:20] <quazimodo> but to me it indicates poor data modelling in almost all circumstances
[06:02:26] <quazimodo> there are ofcourse exceptions to that 
[06:02:34] <CoJaBo> quazimodo: Ever have a morecolumns column to store the extra columns as JSON in a TEXT type? Fun times..
[06:02:57] <quazimodo> CoJaBo: if the data isn't something you're going ot query then I don't have a problem with JSON columns 
[06:03:10] <quazimodo> actually postgres can index json columns really well so even then it's not too bad
[06:04:11] <quazimodo> honestly the majority of backend devs I have worked with/met don't really understand or know what is truly current, relational data

[12:28:43] <DarkTrick> merijn, I just figured out, that the UX in this area seems quite bad
[12:28:59] <DarkTrick> you can either block all unencrypted messages or let them all through
[12:29:07] <DarkTrick> (e.g. google)
[12:29:31] <DarkTrick> If you block them, you don't even get a notification or perhaps even the content of the message

[12:31:08] <merijn> DarkTrick: You generally don't connect directly to the client's mail server
[12:31:38] <merijn> You connect to *yours* which will relay it to the client mail server (through possibly multiple intermediate servers) and you have no control whether that relay is using TLS or not
[12:31:59] <merijn> DarkTrick: So the answer is simple: You can never send anything that should be encrypted
[12:32:00] <comet23> so the computer that i just in the mail got has 32gb ddr4 ryzen 5950x and a rtx 3080, 480gb sata ssd + 3tb hdd... for $788.62 more i got a computer with an i9 12900kf, rtx 3090, and 64gb, 1tb m.2 nvme... with that being said should i keep this pc that i got in the mail just now or should i return it and keep the one that's $788.62 more?
[12:33:29] <DarkTrick> merijn, uh, I totally forgot about the intermediate servers -_-
[12:33:46] <Raziel> comet23, sooo, double the ram, 3090 vs 3080, and a bigger and probably better ssd, and an intel cpu that doesn't suck which is definitely a new one in some years now
[12:33:57] <DarkTrick> So after more than 30 years of internet, they still didn't make mail secure :(
[12:33:59] <flakland> comet23 either of them have ECC memory?
[12:34:06] <comet23> ddr5 has builtin ecc
[12:34:11] <Raziel> flakland, I can guarantee they do not :p
[12:34:11] <comet23> ddr4 doubt it
[12:34:16] <Raziel> comet23, different kind of ecc there
[12:34:22] <comet23> what's the difference?

[16:35:02] <pulse> Start with a piece of paper and pen
[16:35:05] <mobidrop> just start typing pseudo code
[16:35:18] <pulse> Draw some boxes with arrows, then implement the basic architecture of your program
[16:35:24] <pulse> Then expand as necessary over time
[16:35:41] <pulse> Overthinking leads to analysis paralysis
[16:35:47] <pulse> Underthinking leads to poor implementation
[16:35:55] <pulse> Ideally you want just the right amount of thinking :P
[16:35:58] <MiraCat> For some reason, doing C/C++ makes me freeze up, but I can quickly hack up some python or lisp code.
[16:36:16] <pulse> That probably means you're not comfortable in C and C++ and you're second guessing yourself
[16:36:24] <merijn> Not so sure, tbh
[16:36:42] <merijn> I find myself with the same issue in C/C++ because starting from scratch in them is such a massive hassle
[16:36:53] <merijn> And I can't be arsed, usually
[16:37:01] <MiraCat> How do I get more comfortable with C and C++ pulse?
[16:37:05] <merijn> Working on existing massive codebases usually feels easier then writing something small
[16:37:13] <pulse> MiraCat, Write a lot of C and C++
[16:37:43] <pulse> merijn, Idk, depends if you have some references I suppose. I have a lot of my own projects that I can use as a basis for my new projects
[16:37:44] *** Joins: pikapika (~pikapika_@pika.powered.by.lunarbnc.net)
[16:37:47] <merijn> MiraCat: tbh, I'd just keep prototyping in python/lisp and then translating from those to C/C++
[16:38:02] <pulse> I don't think that's a good mapping tbh
[16:38:11] <pulse> C++ requires a different mindset to both of those languages
[16:38:12] <merijn> pulse: Right. Most of my experience has been on massive several 100k LOC codebases
[16:38:32] <merijn> pulse: Sure, but when you know what you want and what kinda IO you need, it's easier (for me) to write the C++ code
[16:39:06] <merijn> Because when the logic/structure is in my head, implementing it in C++ is "just writing the code". It's the initial exploratory part I hate using C++ for
[16:39:28] <merijn> then again, might as well do the prototyping in Rust or Haskell and then don't bother reimplementing in C++ :p
[16:39:31] <pulse> Idk, I think C++ has a lot of tools for foundational programming
[16:39:33] <pulse> I kind of like it
[16:39:35] <MiraCat> I think the reason why I'm more comfortable with python or lisp is that functions can be written without doing extra work such as putting it in main(). Like emacs comes with a scratch buffer just for elisp hacking.
[16:41:31] <MiraCat> I'll try downloading C or C++ projects from github and hack them a bit. Expand tiny extra functionality just to get comfortable with C/C++.
[16:42:29] <merijn> So, internet, what language should I use for Advent of Code this year? Current top contenders are J and Forth (although I dunno which Forth I should be using...)
[16:42:39] <deniska> merijn: QBASIC?
[16:42:43] *** Joins: DnzAtWrk (~DnzAtWrk@mobile-access-567343-143.dhcp.inet.fi)
[16:42:52] <MiraCat> ooo, forth. Nice to see forthers around here.
[16:42:56] <merijn> deniska: I want *interesting* languages :p
[16:43:02] <merijn> MiraCat: I don't know Forth, hence why :p
[16:43:20] <deniska> merijn: forth, but you have to write your own :D
[16:43:47] <MiraCat> Is there a sort of scratch pad for C/C++ to where you can write simple functions but don't have to write a whole program?
[16:44:20] <deniska> MiraCat: is it really that hard to write `int main() {}`? :P
[16:45:09] <DnzAtWrk> don't know why
[16:45:15] <MiraCat> Fine then. Disregard my question then.
[16:45:17] <DnzAtWrk> but my computer always wants to have issues right before meetings
[16:45:22] <DnzAtWrk> like internet breaking

[16:48:33] <deniska> cling
[16:48:47] <deniska> but it's so cursed may as well just use C++ in a normal way instead :)
[16:50:05] <MiraCat> After doing some elisp hacking, I can't stop thinking of everything with linked lists.
[16:50:36] <mrig> MiraCat do you know what it is that you want to make?
[16:50:38] <mobidrop> I'm PHP programmer, I always use arrays, always
[16:50:51] <mobidrop> map? array? array? array!
[16:50:55] <Valware> $same[] = $me;
[16:51:10] <mobidrop> only 1 value? return ['value' => $value];
[16:51:59] <MiraCat> mrig No, I'm still undecided. I guess I want to make video games, but I simply cannot decide between doing it in lisp/scheme OR C/C++.
[16:52:17] <deniska> C++ is somewhat closer to video games making
[16:52:51] <deniska> at least as far as the industry goes, nothing prohibits you from making games in whatever weird language, as far as you can poke at graphics, inputs and sounds through it
[16:53:13] <deniska> Also you're allowed to know and use more than one language at once
[16:53:21] <mrig> MiraCat I'm working through a really good set of tutorials at the moment, would highly recommend them : https://handmadehero.org/
[16:53:22] <bayaz> Title: Handmade Hero 
[16:53:39] <mrig> First thing that you do is to learn to sketch with code.
[16:53:53] <MiraCat> Thanks mrig.
[16:54:12] <Thedarkb-Desktop> C with SDL is all you need.

[16:54:32] <mrig> better without SDL in my opinion, that is a little high level.

[16:55:25] <Thedarkb-Desktop> That's kind of the idea, I don't think anyone likes having to write their own drawing backends for different platforms.
[16:55:44] <mrig> black boxes seem to interrupt the sketching process, for me anyhow. 
[16:55:52] <MiraCat> In all honesty, I think I'll go full lisp/scheme because once I'm really adjusted to a language rules, it's a PITA to change to another one. Especially if it's radically different like going from lisp to C/C++. Plus chicken scheme and bigloo will translate to C, so speed isn't an issue.

[16:57:11] <MiraCat> AAA games maybe, but no such rules for hobbyist or indie games.
[16:57:18] <Thedarkb-Desktop> Naughty Dog use LISP but I think they tend to use it in more of an imperative style iirc
[16:57:28] <mobidrop> plenty of successful indie games are written in other languages
[16:57:47] <MiraCat> Runescape used to be a java game before they switch to C++.
[16:57:59] <mobidrop> same with minecraft
[16:58:14] <deniska> java versions of both games still have a following :)

[17:01:07] <deniska> mrig: did it have settings to tone it down?
[17:01:12] <mrig> MiraCat well I only mentioned those series as you mentioned C/C++
[17:01:24] <mrig> deniska no not at all and it was a simple 2d game.
[17:01:36] <mrig> just went full cpu for nothing at all.
[17:02:11] <mrig> shame as the game seemed pretty good, rather ironically it was emulating 16bit styling.

[17:06:55] <mobidrop> especially in gamedev they don't care
[17:07:17] <merijn> deniska: As a counterpoint, just look at how amazing the new Doom's looked and how rock solid they performed on even mediocre hardware
[17:07:59] <merijn> Doom 2016 runs at a rocksolid 60FPS on my (old, shitty) pc while some games a fraction as pretty run like shit
[17:08:38] <deniska> merijn: I always felt that way about Source games
[17:08:45] <mrig> would also depend on whether you want to write the entire game or use and engine I suppose.
[17:08:55] <merijn> deniska: That they ran shitty? Or ran well?
[17:09:16] <tomathy> is it normal for a therapist to tell you you make them uncomfortable

[18:18:09] <MiraCat> I would definitely rebind the tty menu key to something else. Go to your .emacs or init.el file and I would add that to your init file.
[18:18:15] <MiraCat> Because by default it's F10

[18:58:03] <Decker> Intelo websockets is actually pretty light other than its almost a guaranteed copy operation on one side
[18:58:05] <EdFletcher> Intelo: if you're looking for speed, I can promise you that will won't find much faster than Redis. and unless you're operating at Google scale, you don't need anything faster than that.
[18:58:22] <Intelo> EdFletcher if so, how much slow and how much ease. Don't think it would be much difficult to just make to protocol but the performance of http can't be improved
[18:58:23] *** Joins: hololeap (~hololeap@user/hololeap)
[18:58:25] <deniska> Intelo: Anyway, the bottom line is that you're going to spend time implementing features HTTP already gives you for free, so it's worth exploring what other people came up with (protobufs already mentioned) instead of trying to DIY something directly on top of TCP
[18:58:31] <Decker> inventing a more round wheel though - go ahead :) we need -friction protocols
[18:58:41] <EdFletcher> yeah websockets would be a solid choice for service-to-service communication too, they have the major benefit that they can easily get through every firewall on the planet (because they're HTTP)

[18:59:38] <EdFletcher> Intelo: Redis is _blazingly_ fast, I can't imagine you could improve on its speed with your own protocol but much more than a few percent and you'd have put in tons of extra work. just use Redis 🙂
[18:59:51] <Decker> the hit of HTTP negotiation goes away ... amortized over time since the rest of the stream is a few bytes for length and the data
[19:00:01] <deniska> The only way to be reasonably faster than redis is not to do networking at all
[19:00:04] <Decker> and no DNS lookup/TCP syn/ack, ...
[19:00:07] <deniska> Nothing beats local function call

[19:00:44] <Decker> if only the worlds services all existed in one library :)
[19:00:58] <EdFletcher> yeah agreed Decker, I like websockets here a lot too, I've used them in this capacity between services before with success. specifically when those services were behind firewalls I couldn't control
[19:01:05] <deniska> While http certainly has bits of overhead as far as parsing headers and stuff is concerned, the biggest elephant in the room is the fact of doing networking at all

[19:07:52] <sonny> ooh
[19:07:59] <Intelo> Decker I was talking about simple sockets. not web sockets. EdFletcher ok.  deniska I don't disagree with you but what to do about performance?
[19:08:15] <Decker> Intelo simple socket = TCP 
[19:08:21] <Intelo> ya
[19:08:30] <Decker> on top of TCP any decent protocol implements a framing and a ping/keepalive
[19:08:38] <deniska> 443 and 80 inbound sometimes blocked at home ISPs because 1) misconfigured SoHo routers with admin panel on the public interface, 2) you can sell 10x expensive "pro" plan for people who actually want to host things
[19:08:41] <Decker> and then starts filling in transactional messages
[19:09:11] <Intelo> maybe I have not done or I do not know if different programming languages can communicate just fine on same websocket. It was not the easy case few years ago though
[19:09:15] <Decker> websockets is a very light protocol that handles that general abstraction for you and lets you concentrate no just bulding the messages; even for a non-web service, websockets is a preetty good protocol
[19:09:31] <sonny> so basically, it's still difficult to create secure networks?
[19:09:44] <Decker> (though you can disable masking all around; websockets does require one side to use 4 extra bytes and mask)
[19:09:46] <deniska> sonny: sure, it requires, like, thinking
[19:09:59] <deniska> thinking and not being lazy
[19:10:03] <deniska> so, practically impossible
[19:10:04] <EdFletcher> yup Intelo websockets were suggested because they provide the framing and other protocol niceties you need and they're available everywhere. and yes, they are programming-language agnostic.
[19:10:49] <deniska> do protobufs actually define a protocol over tcp or are they just serialization?
[19:11:01] <sonny> I've got it
[19:11:04] <EdFletcher> sonny: yup what deniska said, it's a constant battle against the attackers. do you have a webserver on the open internet? just watch its logs for a day or so, you'll see how much of the internet is just bot traffic scanning for vulnerabilities
[19:11:11] <Decker> they're just serialization
[19:11:23] <EdFletcher> deniska: by themselves just serialization. gRPC defines a whole protocol for remote procedure call using them.
[19:11:39] <sonny> just replace IP
[19:11:43] <Decker> sounds like what socketio did to websockets :)
[19:12:07] <EdFletcher> Decker: haha indeed!
[19:12:17] <deniska> doesn't socketio predate websockets?
[19:12:38] <EdFletcher> does it!? i mean it could since their fallback is just http long polling, but i didn't think so
[19:12:46] <Decker> it does so it had to maintain some HTTP compatilbity in the things it did - and it already had a encoding protocol
[19:12:50] <deniska> I remember their fallback being flash among other stuff

Maybe I have to reconnect on disconnection but thats all.  It is a stream too I guess. The only difference in redis and WS it seems that latter has pub/sub
[19:20:00] <Decker> reconnect is a app thing 
[19:20:08] <Decker> when it gets a close notice it can choose
[19:20:12] <deniska> Intelo: well, redis is an application in its own, so it's one more thing to run
[19:20:27] <deniska> Intelo: with websockets some programs will have to act as servers, and some will need to be clients
[19:20:33] <Decker> former has pubsub

[19:26:22] <Intelo> Decker deniska EdFletcher what would be the final vote?  WS or redis so I take it and further do research from here.
[19:27:07] <Decker> I'm just on WS; redis has merits; it's a lot of bloat for what it does?
[19:27:07] <deniska> Intelo: I like redis, but that's because it's a useful component on its own, beyond shifting messages around
[19:27:14] <EdFletcher> Intelo: it's important to note that redis and websockets are not perfectly comparable here: one is a full in-memory data structure store with a _lot_ more features than we're discussing here, the other is just a transport
[19:27:33] <Decker> using JS on websockets is pretty easy - connection pooling for multicast(group chat) is easy group.push( connection );
[19:27:39] <EdFletcher> because of that, you layer them as noted before: i use websockets as a _transport_ for redis pub/sub

[19:47:16] <Decker> I have this websocket service - it's slightly not API compatible with 'ws' ; and socketio doesn't plug into it and redis probably wouldn't play well either... but I can show you super simple boiler plates for such things; I'm using heroku to deploy - it works from github branches or docker images

[23:24:10] <user51> does 'generalized shunting yard' make sense?

[23:26:16] <vdamewood> For example, if you have puts("Hello, world"); You could make that "Hello, world" puts. And puts would 'consume' one item, but with printf, you'd need a machanism to specify how many arguments.
[23:26:16] <GeDaMo> You could do something equivalent to printf where the first parameter specified how many other parameters there were

[23:26:31] <GeDaMo> In fact, I've done something like that in Forth
[23:26:36] <Decker> it could just dump c into rpn or vice versa ... 3 "hello,world %d" printf 
[23:27:02] <user51> hm. i did think about printf
[23:27:18] *** Quits: flakland (~flaknet99@32.211.211.39) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:28:02] <user51> oh, just to clarify, how is printf built?
[23:28:15] <Decker> the format argument determines how many args there are
[23:28:18] <apotheon> Maybe it'd have %d first in the parameters.
[23:28:26] <apotheon> using rpn
[23:28:36] <GeDaMo> https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/variadic
[23:28:36] <Decker> va_arg can setup a variable as a pointer on the stack, and you use that to get each argument on the stack
[23:28:37] <bayaz> Title: Variadic arguments - cppreference.com 
[23:28:56] <Decker> well the string itself says how many there are
[23:28:57] <user51> GeDaMo: can i see your forth printf?
[23:29:10] <Decker> it had 1 %d so it has 1 extra parameter that's an inteer
[23:29:20] <GeDaMo> It wasn't a printf, just a word which dealt with variable number of parameters

[23:30:34] <user51> ok, i'm just making sure i have the right model: printf would loop over the string given, and decide what to do based on the character it gets, right?

[23:31:27] <pyzozord> from what I understand vargs in c under the hood would be usually implemented using stack in assembly
[23:31:52] <user51> so if it sees perhaps %d it would simply print the item before the string in the stack
[23:31:55] <pyzozord> the first few arguments might go to the registers behaving like with normal c abi, but rest will go on stack
[23:31:56] <Decker> don't need assembly
[23:31:58] <user51> 5 "%d" printf
[23:32:16] <GeDaMo> The words @# and !# deal with variable number of parameters, the top parameter specifies the number
[23:32:25] <Decker> the va_arg stuff is mostly just macros... the &lastArg + sizeof( lastArg ) = arg after last arg
[23:33:30] <Decker> anotehr option is to use like a EndCommand... updateDIsplay( MOVE, 1, 1, SIZE, 10, 10, TITLE, "bob, END )
