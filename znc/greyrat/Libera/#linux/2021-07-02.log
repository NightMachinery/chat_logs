[07:23:22] <Dagmar> rascul: I dunno about any other errors.  I do know I've dealt with three support calls from people who can't get into freakin' MatrixCare because of some garbage routing _somewhere_ but I've been unable to track down here
[07:23:58] <rascul> Dagmar i think it was last night i was explaining why it's very unreliable to get a location from an ip
[07:24:03] <Dagmar> I had to reach in and set up fixed paths based on the IP addresses alone so the traffic for that one freakin' site goes through the VPN back to us to sidestep the issue

[07:25:03] <rascul> powerhouse_ that one doesn't work either, ibb.co is saying it doesn't exist

[07:25:36] <powerhouse_> https://ibb.co/nCW4hbR
[07:25:45] <Dagmar> I suspect the main issue is that only networking engineers know what an ASN is and understand BGP but middle managers recognize the word "database" real quick

[09:06:55] <Kyv> Well and good until the code is used in an indefensible way, but the psychological burden wont be there because you probably wont know.
[09:07:11] <mlu> fling: do you care if you get credit for it?

[09:07:47] <mlu> if the first is no but the second is yes, I suggest a libpng/zlib type license
[09:07:59] <fling> I mostly only want the improvements to be published if there are any
[09:07:59] <mlu> if both are no, public domain: it just makes things much easier
[09:08:16] <mlu> fling: yeah, gplv2 or gplv3 is appropriate

[09:09:04] <mlu> fling: just note that this may have the side effect of preventing those who refuse to share their improvements from using your script
[09:09:29] <mlu> I hope that's consistent with your intention

[14:53:23] <phogg> dostoyevsky2: the short answer is no, the longer answer is that you can probably always assume they're there
[14:54:09] <dostoyevsky2> phogg: I am debugging a startup script where USER and HOME are not set, snowballing to problems with expanding ~ in another script
[14:54:14] <phogg> dostoyevsky2: USER is traditionally set by login(1), so it is likely to exist so long as your login mechanism does this. It is possible that someone could unset it, but it's unlikely anyone would.
[14:54:33] <phogg> I believe $HOME is the same (set by login or via pam, ultimately taken from passwd information)
[14:54:48] <dostoyevsky2> phogg: yeah, but I think the rc scripts are not being spawned by login

[14:55:13] <phogg> dostoyevsky2: what kind of startup script?
[14:56:07] <Kyv> If HOME is unset, the home directory of the user executing the shell is substituted instead. Otherwise the tilde prefix is replaced with the home directory associated with the specified login name.
[14:56:17] <phogg> Right, rc scripts and things like /etc/init.d scripts are invoked directly from your initd. It is not necessarily going to define such env vars, but usually they will be defined to the values set for root in passwd
[14:56:18] <dostoyevsky2> phogg: startup-script-url in of a google compute instance...
[14:57:00] <phogg> dostoyevsky2: ~ will always expand in a shell (it can't fail to expand)

[18:07:57] <caterfxo> phogg: the way the project would be managed?
[18:08:09] *** Parts: lok (~lok@2607:fa49:440:8200:99cb:c5d:a75:d39a) ()
[18:08:15] <varaindemian> it works just fine: `#1 chromium-browser --new-window & sleep 1; win=$(xdotool getactivewindow); echo $win #2 wmctrl -i -c my_number_in_$win`
[18:08:28] <curdlesnoot> phogg: I think the combination of Lennart-contempt and pulseaudio initially being in a sort of beta state had a lot to do with it, with the latter doing much to inform the former. in practice, not that many are able to come to an informed opinion as you might be able to (how many people even use jackd, for example).
[18:08:38] <varaindemian> phogg ^
[18:08:49] <phogg> caterfxo: things like ignoring prior work in the area, and disregarding advice from experienced people, then declaring anyone not using it to be "legacy" and encouraging support of nothing else

[18:09:49] <varaindemian> phogg thank you!
[18:09:59] <curdlesnoot> later, systemd capitalised - as it were - on the well entrenched Lennart-contempt, for better or worse. that can also inform one's recollection of history.
[18:10:03] *** Joins: Atum_ (~IRC@user/atum/x-2392232)
[18:10:16] <curdlesnoot> (trying to remain neutral there)
[18:10:58] <phogg> For me, the whole way systemd is put together from front to back is wrong. Socket activation isn't new (inetd has been doing it for decades) and we didn't need to rebuild the world in order to adopt it. Complaining about sysvinit by saying shell scripts are bad is disingenuous because you can write init "scripts" in any language.
[18:11:35] <phogg> The right way looks much more like s6 with a minimal init. I will note that s6 was not even considered as a viable starting point because, again like with pulse and jack, NIH applies.
[18:11:51] <rapha> is it certain that if i zip a bunch of files up with `zip blah.zip $(ls -1 | sort | xargs)` they will end up in the zip file in the same order as ls outputs them?
[18:11:53] <caterfxo> there's a lot of broken shell scripts out there
[18:12:17] <phogg> the goal wasn't "do initd better", the goal was "build a new base 'Linux OS' plumbing layer that works more like Mac OS" or in some ways like Windows
[18:12:18] <curdlesnoot> phogg: I think the way launchd does socket activation was an improvement, with Lennart poaching liberally but yes, I get where you're coming from. it's never going to appeal to someone who just wanted a better supervisory suite to become popular, without all the bells and whistles.
[18:12:30] <phogg> the goal was clear from the approach, but it was not presented as the goal
[18:13:06] <Fleck> curdlesnoot: fstrim -av puts again that ssd to 100% busy while other stays at 30%
[18:13:22] <phogg> caterfxo: "shell scripts are hard to write", "shell scripts are slow", and "shell scripts are buggy" are not in the set of reasons not to use sysvinit. No one forces anyone to use shell scripts as init programs.
[18:13:32] <rapha> phogg: good thing there's ppl who do their own thing and don't give a rat's ass about systemd.
[18:13:32] <curdlesnoot> Fleck: give it some time. if you've never trimmed, it could take a while for the firmware to deal with the request.

[18:14:46] <curdlesnoot> Fleck: issues the FITRIM ioctl, so as to trim blocks associated with space that the filesystem doesn't - or no longer - allocates.
[18:15:10] <phogg> curdlesnoot: the secret plan which then made all of the defects in the design more obviously deliberate, because they're not defects if making a better initd wasn't your real goal

[18:24:15] <phogg> caterfxo: it was about ushering in a new notion of what a "standard system" looks like, reducing variance between distros. This is only bad inasmuch as it raises the level of effort required to do something different than the expected

[18:26:02] <curdlesnoot> phogg: I do think that there's a certain element of complacency that is to blame also. as in, hurr durr, a primitive service model based on sysv init paired with a braindead, non-supervisory method of managing services is JustFine(tm) and NothingNeedsToBeChanged(tm). that may have contributed to the inertia against s6 and the like becoming more popular.

[18:30:48] <phogg> curdlesnoot: trying to get a distribution to switch to something fancier than sysvinit is a hard sell. There's a lot of inertia there, so such switches were not common. That's not because people were standing still.
[18:30:51] <curdlesnoot> the median is not at your level.

[18:34:52] <peetaur> Fleck: ok this is very unfamiliar output... I never use atop... is that what this is? So the DSK lines have disk stuff but they look mostly ok... 7.8k write iops is not terrible (better than my consumer SATA, worse than my consumer NVMe for some workloads but not all, and doesn't compare to DC nvme which does >100k iops), but not great.

[18:38:44] <Fleck> :/
[18:38:47] <peetaur> oh I see the "busy" column.... I guess that may be %util from iostat
[18:39:13] <curdlesnoot> phogg: an association of "verteran" unix admins that were quite happy with the "embarassment", and forked to continue it, no less. their only selling point is "it's not systemd". where were they when it came to promoting daemontools, s6 or other solutions to the point of becoming a de-facto standard?
[18:39:32] <peetaur> Fleck: weird stuff happens with virtual layers... maybe it's doing a sync write on one, and doing reordering and async on the other..how can we know?
[18:39:42] <phogg> curdlesnoot: the fact that devuan still ships with sysvinit has nothing to do with people thinking that it is an optimal initd. It's used because "that's what we had before" and goal #1 is not getting locked in to systemd. Goal #2 is doing something better.
[18:39:56] <curdlesnoot> phogg: I'll believe #2 when I see it.
[18:40:15] <curdlesnoot> sounds like RightAroundTheCorner(tm) to me.
[18:40:15] <phogg> curdlesnoot: there has been some effort to make #2 happen, but only a limited amount of talent dedicated to it.

[20:06:02] <peetaur> and 2552 iops isn't really that high...what kind of ssd is it? SATA SSDs can do like 3-6k (samsung evo does 3600 or so I think), and NVMe with pcie interface ought to be higher

[20:08:45] <peetaur> but 220k is very high still... if it is an honest number with some actual meaning, a non-sync heavy workload like a desktop, not a database, might benefit
[20:08:50] <Fleck> yeah while I used dd for first 100GB it was 1.8GB/s-1.4GB/s
[20:09:27] <peetaur> and....I put   --eta-newline=1  in my example command and wanted to see it.... you can see the trend over time. Was the start really fast and then cache filled and it was slow after?
[20:09:39] <peetaur> it should print the avg ever eta-newline seconds
