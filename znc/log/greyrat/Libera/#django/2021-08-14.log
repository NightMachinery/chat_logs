[00:15:27] <twomanytacos> using drf i have the standard endpoints for models using viewsets, BUT for `GET` requests we are doing lots of custom filtering using query params, would it be better to create independent entpoints for each filter or is good practice to have all the filter logic inside the `get_queryset`

[00:19:32] <shangxiao> twomanytacos: that sounds like it'd come down to personal preferences.  For me it'd depend on how much this filtering actually started to create distinctly separate resources.

[00:20:34] <twomanytacos> shangxiao: so it's two cases right now that we need to differentiate with query params BUT it seems that will get more of these so i think is a good time to keep the endpoints separate by use case
[00:20:45] <twomanytacos> but i don't know if that's a good practice in django

[06:19:44] <routebee> Heya peeps
[06:27:48] <routebee> Maybe y'all can advise me... How do I find out what Django applications (I don't know that I said that right) are available? I need an electronic library web app that can serve RTF eBooks to users.
[06:29:04] <GinFuyou> You mean a ready django-based solution or plugin for django site?
[06:30:46] <routebee> I'm not sure honestly... I'm giving myself a year to do my first website and I love ke python so I'm thinking Django...
[06:31:26] <GinFuyou> Well, I'm not quite sure what is an end goal...
[06:32:58] <routebee> I want people to log in and have access to read eBooks
[06:33:11] <routebee> Sorry I'm on a phone
[06:33:17] <routebee> Slow
[06:34:23] <routebee> What's the difference between a Django based solution and a plugin
[06:35:39] <GinFuyou> I meant something you just install and configure and done, vs something you integrate into other project (e.g. one you coded yourself)
[06:36:16] <GinFuyou> later would be (reusable) "app" in django terms
[06:37:33] <GinFuyou> Also I meant if you want to code everything\something\nothing yourself
[06:37:58] <routebee> Yeah I'm thinking something I "modify" rather than configure. Some other app that I can bastardise
[06:38:55] <routebee> I am expecting I am going to have to code a lot but I don't want to start from scratch
[06:38:57] <GinFuyou> Well, I'm not sure how specific is what you've described
[06:39:55] <routebee> Where are all the projects collated? Can I search through them in one place?
[06:40:12] <GinFuyou> anyway, first of all you should take a look at django official tutorial. It takes you starting the project and doing basics. Reusable app will require you to have an own project
[06:40:31] <routebee> Okay
[06:40:51] <routebee> You got the link handy?
[06:41:20] <GinFuyou> not really, but pretty comprehensive resource is https://djangopackages.org/
[06:41:37] *** Quits: bitdex (~bitdex@gateway/tor-sasl/bitdex) (Quit: = "")
[06:41:50] <routebee> No I meant the tutorial?
[06:42:13] <routebee> I'll google

[07:06:08] <routebee> So am I right in thinking that you have to pay for a database to get more than one user connected at a time?
[07:08:50] <FunkyBob> no
[07:09:38] <FunkyBob> sqlite, postgres, mysql, plenty of others are free with all their features
[07:10:00] <routebee> Mmk
[07:10:39] <FunkyBob> if someone's hosting that for you, they may put limits on it, sure
[07:11:30] <routebee> I'm skimming the Django Girls tutorial and the loopback website only supports one user
[07:12:31] <FunkyBob> loopback?
[07:12:56] <FunkyBob> i don't recall there being a 'loopback' site in that tutorial
[07:13:09] <FunkyBob> can you link to where you mean?
[07:14:10] <routebee> I'll finish reading
[07:14:21] <routebee> Thanks
[07:14:48] <twomoon> where is blitzkraft
[07:15:47] <GinFuyou> All software needed to run django site can be completely free, you'll usually pay for hosting hardware and networking

[13:05:09] <pycode> FunkyBob, pardon i am back, if i allow null values i think django should left join it...
[13:05:14] <pycode> FunkyBob, why not?
[13:05:20] <pycode> i should create a range filter
[13:05:46] <FunkyBob> you really want to test against a meaningless auto-id?
[13:06:03] <FunkyBob> i don't see why nullability would influence using left join
[13:08:55] <pycode> FunkyBob, pardon i do not understand you i need to get from ID 10 to id 100 but as i wrote it should be a left join because it is not mandatory in this case, if exists ok, i need to show it otherwise no
[13:09:51] <FunkyBob> since you're testing if the value exists and is larger than 1... nullabl is irrelevant.
[13:09:57] <FunkyBob> and yes, it likely should use a left join

[13:11:39] *** Joins: barrios (~barrios@2a02:3030:1:e39:5f5b:9e28:b2f:5fc8)
[13:13:02] <pycode> FunkyBob, FROM "base_price" INNER JOIN "base_trade" ON ("base_price"."id" = "base_trade"."entry_price_id") WHERE ("base_trade"."id" > 10 AND "base_trade"."id" < 100)
[13:13:21] <pycode> str(Price.objects.filter(entry_price__gt=10, entry_price__lt=100).query)
[13:14:11] <FunkyBob> inner join makes sense
[13:14:22] <FunkyBob> since by asking for gt=1... you are requiring the value to exist
[13:14:56] <pycode> FunkyBob, uh ? i am asking >10 and <100
[13:15:00] <FunkyBob> es
[13:15:01] <FunkyBob> yes
[13:15:03] <FunkyBob> so it can't be null
[13:15:23] <FunkyBob> null is not inside that range... the value must exist, and be within that range
[13:15:43] <FunkyBob> that said, it doesn't need the join at all, really
[13:16:11] <FunkyBob> if you're querying from the side that has the fkey... you can query its value directly in the table
[13:16:22] <pycode> ok
[13:16:53] <FunkyBob> though it looks like you're querying base_price, and filtering base_trade.. where base_trade has the fkey to base_price ?
[13:17:05] <FunkyBob> [and I still say filtering on the PK value seems bizarre]
[13:17:10] <pycode> FunkyBob, one moment i gave you an example of the models
[13:19:22] <pycode> FunkyBob, please take a look at : https://bpa.st/BKFA basically i need to GET ALL the prices but i also need to left join the Trade AND THEN I need to filter for entry_price and exit_price so basically the sql should be  ... from prices left join trades on prices.id between trades.entry_price and trades.exit_price
[13:19:30] <pycode> FunkyBob, this is the real query i need to do ^^
[13:19:58] <pycode> because i need to return all the prices AND one more fields that is referring to Trade
[13:20:09] <pycode> the "op" field you see on Trade
[13:20:26] <pycode> so basically i need an output like   ts, o, l, h, c, op
[13:20:41] <pycode> the first 5th fields are from Price model the last one from OP
[13:21:01] <pycode> but in this case it is not mandatory that on all the prices there is a Trade...so it must be a left join
[13:21:01] <FunkyBob> still don't see why it'd be a left join
[13:21:10] <pycode> FunkyBob, ^
[13:21:44] <pycode> because i need to return all the Price plus a field that show what operation has been made but as i wrote it is not mandatory, so no all the prices have a trade
[13:22:34] <FunkyBob> is it entry/exit price of a specific trade?
[13:22:41] <FunkyBob> or of any trade? or...
[13:23:13] <pycode> yes those are basically the boundaries of the trade the exit price (the time that the trade has been executed....and same for exit_time)
[13:23:30] <FunkyBob> that.... doesn't clarify anything for me
[13:23:32] <pycode> i know one thing, that MAX 1 trade per price could exist
[13:23:43] <pycode> yes it is for a specific trade sure
[13:24:00] <FunkyBob> so for a given trade, you want to find all the prices between its entry and exit prices?
[13:24:49] <pycode> so i just want to return all the prices of a period for example 2021-01-01 <-> 2021-06-30 and then add a field that let me understand what operation has been made (the "op" field i wrote above)
[13:25:16] <FunkyBob> ...
[13:25:16] <pycode> as i wrote a price could have a trade or not, for that reason the "trade" should be NOT mandatory
[13:25:35] <FunkyBob> where did this period suddenly appear from/
[13:26:10] <pycode> i need to add a new .filter() for this range sure.
[13:26:18] <FunkyBob> fuck me
[13:26:24] <FunkyBob> it';s impossible to help you
[13:26:30] <FunkyBob> because you keep changinmg things
[13:26:34] <FunkyBob> and not directly answering my question
[13:27:05] <FunkyBob> for a second there it seemed you wanted all the Prices from t.entry_price to t.exit_price
[13:27:10] <FunkyBob> but now you're talking about some date range
[13:27:13] <pycode> str(Price.objects.filter(ts__range=('2021-01-01', '2021-06-30')).filter(entry_price__gt=10, entry_price__lt=100).query)
[13:27:16] <pycode> same thing
[13:27:18] <FunkyBob> no
[13:27:18] <pycode> same inner join
[13:27:20] <FunkyBob> not the same thing
[13:27:41] <pycode> FROM "base_price" INNER JOIN "base_trade" ON ("base_price"."id" = "base_trade"."entry_price_id") WHERE ("base_price"."ts" BETWEEN 2021-01-01 00:00:00+00:00 AND 2021-06-30 00:00:00+00:00 AND "base_trade"."id" > 10 AND "base_trade"."id" < 100)
[13:27:50] <FunkyBob> still not interested
[13:27:56] <FunkyBob> because I think your query is flat out wrong
[13:28:01] <FunkyBob> but you wont'  answer me
[13:28:05] <FunkyBob> so I can't resolve it
[13:28:11] <FunkyBob> so... enjoy yourself
[13:29:55] <pycode> FunkyBob, i do not understand what should i explain more, ok my english is bad so it is 80% of the problem :) but as i wrote i have two models Price and Trade(link above) i need to return ALL the Price in the table PLUS a field that is coming from Trade that should respondo to a query like ....from prices left join trades on prices.id between trades.entry_price and trades.exit_price WHERE prices.ts between '2021-01-01' and
[13:29:55] <pycode> '2021-06-30'
[13:30:03] <pycode> that's it
[13:30:12] <FunkyBob> it's not about your english
[13:30:18] <FunkyBob> I've seen the models
[13:30:35] <FunkyBob> but earlier you said you wanted the prices between entry and exit price for a specific trade
[13:30:42] <FunkyBob> then suddenly you switched to date ranges
[13:30:45] <FunkyBob> which is it?
[13:30:48] <FunkyBob> because this is vital
[13:31:44] <FunkyBob> stop wasting time typing out your theoretical queries
[13:33:00] <FunkyBob> now it seems you want _both_ the date range filter _and_ the entry/exit filter
[13:33:06] <pycode> FunkyBob, pardon the filter must be on range of dates like the last code i shown you
[13:33:17] <pycode> no the second filter on entry/exit is for that "op" field i need that field
[13:33:24] <pycode> to understand on that price what op has been made
[13:33:28] <pycode> (if exists)
[13:33:40] <FunkyBob> see? this is why you need to stop writing the fucking SQL, and just explain what you need
[13:34:46] <FunkyBob> since Trade has _two_ FKeys to Price... you can't guarantee a single Trade as related to a given Price
[13:34:57] <FunkyBob> even one fkey would void that guarantee
[13:36:21] <FunkyBob> or is there some other constraint that the entry/exit ranges of Trades can't overlap?
[13:36:23] <pycode> yes i cant guarantee it is a span a trade could have multiple prices
[13:36:34] <pycode> no no
[13:36:36] <FunkyBob> that wasn't it
[13:36:39] <pycode> there are no overlapping trades
[13:36:43] *** Joins: soxfoxrox (~soxfoxrox@80.71.131.255.ipv4.parknet.dk)
[13:36:44] <FunkyBob> a Price can have multiple trades with your model
[13:36:48] <FunkyBob> s
[13:37:10] <pycode> so should i add a m2m field on Price that is pointing to Trade?
[13:37:20] <FunkyBob> so... a Price will always have one-and-only-one Trade whose entry/exit span it falls within?
[13:37:50] <FunkyBob> ISTM Price should have a fkey to Trade
[13:39:45] <pycode> hmm no because there are other field on trade that i can use for example strategy field
[13:39:57] <pycode> so when i need strategy=10 i will get trades on that strategy only
[13:40:12] <soxfoxrox> I am trying to add a max_value validation setting to an IntegerField in a ModelForm. The max_value is passed from the view. I've figured out how to access the max_value in the __init__ method of the form, but I don't have a clue how to actually add it to the validation settings. Can anyone help? Code is here: https://dpaste.org/rf8y
[13:40:22] <FunkyBob> pycode: what has that to do with it??
[13:40:36] <FunkyBob> pycode: you said the entry/exit ranges on Trade are non-overlapping...
[13:40:46] <FunkyBob> so for any Price there is guaranteed to be a single related Trade
[13:40:53] <FunkyBob> and a Trade will have multiple prices.
[13:40:56] <pycode> FunkyBob, sure no overlapp but i have to add the id of the strategy
[13:40:58] <FunkyBob> that's a FKey on Price to Trade
[13:41:13] <FunkyBob> pycode: why? what does that have to do with any of this?
[13:41:14] <pycode> yes yes but at the end i will add the strategy={something} to avoid overlapping
[13:41:17] <soxfoxrox> I have tried the solution at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53955850/pass-variable-from-view-to-form-django but the max_value variable does not seem to be available when I create a function in the form class later.
[13:41:34] <pycode> FunkyBob, a price could have more trades on the same price if i do not filter by strategy too
[13:41:42] <pycode> so filtering by strategy will avoid overlapping for sure
[13:41:50] <FunkyBob> fuck me... any MORE details and constraints you want to let slip?
[13:41:55] <FunkyBob> or are you saving them for later?
[13:42:03] <pycode> no more
[13:42:07] <FunkyBob> tough
[13:42:08] <pycode> that's all i promise :)
[13:42:12] <FunkyBob> i'm too pissed off to care now
[13:42:20] <FunkyBob> changing the fucking rules all the way along
[13:42:46] <pycode> that's all no other constraits
[13:42:57] <pycode> the way i avoid overlapping is filtering by strategy
[13:43:13] <FunkyBob> that makes no sense
[13:45:10] <pycode> why?
[13:45:38] <pycode> a strategy has trades and those trades have entry/exits points that are referring to prices...
[13:45:53] <pycode> if i do not filter by strategy i will get all the trades of all the strategies
[13:45:58] <FunkyBob> well for a start you went from "no two trades have overlapping ranges" ...
[13:46:01] <pycode> and then i will get overlapping trades for sure
[13:46:10] <pycode> FunkyBob, i explained it
[13:46:12] <FunkyBob> to "somehow filtering by strategy enforces this constraint"
[13:46:17] <pycode> a strategy has no overlapping
[13:46:19] <FunkyBob> to NOW explaining a little bit more
[13:46:21] <pycode> so i must add a filter on strategy
[13:46:30] <pycode> yes excuse me
[13:46:38] <pycode> but there are no other rules.

[20:13:04] <Ciurca> this is how I made it export all the files https://dpaste.org/Kdjg
[20:13:49] <Ciurca> let me know please if there is a way to improve this. it exports all the contracts in a ZIP file, the idea is that the event organizer can then print all the contracts from that zip
[20:16:43] <dang`r`us> looks good to me
[20:17:11] <dang`r`us> you might want to stream that if file size can get big
[20:17:13] <dang`r`us> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/request-response/#django.http.StreamingHttpResponse
[20:19:56] <Ciurca> I see, I might use this when I generate the contract for the user. Right now I do time.sleep for about 3 seconds to allow the code to generate and save the contract. I guess the StreamingHttpResponse would work well for this?

[20:28:57] <timdiels> I figured out a way to get an async def in bokeh, that should solve my problem.
[20:33:42] <timdiels> does sync_to_async run it on a different thread each time though? If I were to run ORM like that, it would open a different DB connection each time, right?
[20:36:08] <timdiels> Ah no, it's fine so long as thread_sensitive=True.
