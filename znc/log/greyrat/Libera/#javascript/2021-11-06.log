[02:29:08] <impliednude> I am having an issue. A service my work uses creates whenevery someone clicks the .buynow element an iframe that the service messed up on. I know normally you could on page load do something like $("#examplenamehere iframe").attr('src', function (index, oldSrc) {return oldSrc.replace('oldvalue', 'newvalue');}); but how would I go about it if the iframe is dynamically created?
[02:29:42] <impliednude> should I do an onclick event handler, wait until its loaded then search and replace?

[05:32:45] <jaawerth> lemme see if I can dig it up... I could summarize it but there was also a really neat radiolab episode about it like a decade a go
[05:33:57] <jaawerth> basically the experiment had people come in, memorize a series of numbers, then walk down the hall into another room and report that series of numbers. but the real trick was there was a snack cart with both healthy and unhealthy options, and they were keeping track of which option people went for vs how many numbers they were trying to memorize
[05:34:24] <jaawerth> and you probably won't be surprised to learn there was a big correlation between memorizing more numbers -> unhealthy snack choices

[07:03:10] <sheetjs> they don't exist
[07:03:14] <theskillwithin> typescript

[09:20:21] <ljharb> that implies present tense, the show ended forever ago

[12:23:33] <derjanni> Very bright minds came up with OO concepts and modeling approaches like UML. Now people are saying "I don't like it, I'm going back to 1993" and I would like to understand the rational reasoning behind it.

[12:39:42] <KevinX> they tried to impose a class based paradigm on an functional system
[12:39:44] <derjanni> I use inheritance in React to re-use components, so I have components that inherit multiple other components.
[12:40:04] <KevinX> then suddenly react hooks come and everyone is whole again

[12:41:47] <Booster2ooo> (I guess not :/)
[12:41:53] <theskillwithin> react hooks are generally accepted as industry standard approach in react
[12:42:03] <KevinX> by the way, from the commentary on semicolons

[12:49:35] <theskillwithin> derjanni and what you expressed aren't opinions?
[12:49:38] <KevinX> react is a functional, declarative style that used to try and apply class based paradigms to it's syntax
[12:49:41] <KevinX> it was wrong

[12:50:38] <derjanni> Let me take this on.
[12:50:53] <KevinX> it's not an opinion if you know how react works. It was trying to convert an oop design pattern to functional
[12:50:54] <derjanni> You should use object orientation in React, because it allows you to inherit and thus reuse components.
[12:50:56] <theskillwithin> you assume the bourdon of proof is on us, but really its on you
[12:51:08] <joepie91> derjanni: the general criticism on OOP has much less to do with its fundamental concepts and much more with people trying to rigidly apply it in places where it simply isn't the optimal solution.
[12:51:10] <KevinX> JS in general does it in many ways
[12:51:21] *** Quits: electrostatic (~electrost@2601:600:8600:5a1:8c19:db26:3e15:a492) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[12:51:26] <joepie91> this also applies to things that build on top of OOP, like inheritance
[12:51:34] <theskillwithin> derjanni you can reuse components either way
[12:51:35] <derjanni> joepie91: agree, but then the criticism should be on the bad designs, not on OO in general.
[12:51:48] <KevinX> inheritance is sooo overrated too
[12:52:04] <KevinX> that paradigm fails after about 3 layers
[12:52:06] <theskillwithin> do you really do react?  like is this a troll?
[12:52:22] <derjanni> theskillwithin: do you have an example on how I would have to rewrite my inherited OO components?
[12:52:22] <joepie91> derjanni: well, part of the problem with "OO" is that it has become known as a universal paradigm, and that is definitely a valid criticism towards OO in general. even if you *could* conceivably use it selectively
[12:52:53] <joepie91> derjanni: not that there are no further criticisms; for example, classical inheritance is basically the worst possible inheritance model because it wrongly assumes that all business concerns can be expressed as a clear taxonomy
[12:53:02] <joepie91> yet is commonly used/recommended in OOP
[12:53:07] <theskillwithin> derjanni i don't understand your example, cuz no one would do that even back in class components
[12:53:08] <derjanni> theskillwithin: my largest react application is currently 10k+ lines of code
[12:53:37] *** Quits: gggp (~gggp@111-251-142-222.dynamic-ip.hinet.net) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[12:54:01] <joepie91> so classical inheritance simply cannot express a lot of real-world cases, and so you end up spending your time trying to find ways to emulate or approximate your business case using classes when really you could've also used a more sensible code organization model, such as composition or traits
[12:54:06] <KevinX> derjanni  the issue might be an understanding of the DOM and it's event system. all you need to really know in React is what gets rendered before and after the browser paint
[12:54:25] <theskillwithin> derjanni largest app i worked on was prob 10x that
[12:54:27] <KevinX> i.e. classes dont matter
[12:54:37] <theskillwithin> if not more
[12:54:44] <derjanni> theskillwithin: can you share any public code example of a large non-OO react app?
[12:54:52] <derjanni> doesnt have to be yours
[12:54:55] <joepie91> (trait inheritance is a much more sensible model though rarely needed in practice)
[12:55:03] <KevinX> Yeah.. react
[12:55:04] <KevinX> lol
[12:55:43] <theskillwithin> why am I constantly put on the defense here jesus christ
[12:55:51] <KevinX> traits are the only thing holidng oop together
[12:55:53] <derjanni> are there any open source examples of non-OO react apps? I am willing to be convinced, but would like to properly evaluate it.
[12:55:55] <joepie91> derjanni: when you say "non-OO", you need to clarify whether you actually mean "non-OO" or "without classes" or "without inheritance", as those are not the same thing; classes and classical inheritance are built *on top of* the OOP model, not a fundamental part *of* it
[12:56:28] <KevinX> React is literally a non-oop react app

[15:17:55] <poiqwepoiqwe> access to guns isn't the problem. the problem is being able to duck down to the supermarket on sunday morning to get bacon, eggs and milk with a side of glock and an ar15 assault rifle
[15:17:56] <OhTheCode> yeah i've never understood it either, i'm in Australia, it sounds a little bit crazy to me
[15:17:57] <theskillwithin> facts are facts, and Florida has the best covid stats at the moment
[15:18:27] <theskillwithin> they didn't do mandates, but they have the best stats
[15:18:39] <theskillwithin> they focused on treatment
[15:18:44] <theskillwithin> not politics
[15:18:44] <Philosofen> poiqwepoiqwe, you just contradicted yourself
[15:18:48] <Maxdamantus> theskillwithin: the harm might be less direct (and therefore arguably it's harder to blame individuals), but the harm caused by COVID is probably much greater than the crime caused by people who you think should be shot.
[15:18:59] <Philosofen> Being able to get a glock with your milk and cookies IS "access to guns"
[15:19:15] <theskillwithin> Maxdamantus so fucking beat people?
[15:19:25] <poiqwepoiqwe> did i? or am i saying the problem isnt access its the ease of access the pervasiveness

[15:19:37] <stenno\OK> keep it civilized people

[15:20:15] <theskillwithin> Maxdamantus florida is a success story, so you can't argue with that
[15:20:35] <Philosofen> The whole politics around guns is the problem

[16:53:54] <leduyquang753> Censoring helped bring COVID-19 to spread off also.

[16:55:25] <spynxic> Not vaccines but vaccinated people
[16:56:11] <spynxic> Seems reasonable, no? Shops and venues, airlines and such reopen to vaccinated only
[16:56:19] <efdee> no, not at all reasonable
[16:56:55] <theskillwithin> causality is a funny thing,  but it has been shown higher vaxed populations has higher transmission rates

[22:53:57] <ljharb> sheetjs: not yet
[22:54:11] <ljharb> sheetjs: there’s an RFC for a registry protocol that would let you specify it in deps
[22:54:27] <ljharb> sheetjs: but atm you have to tell people in prose
[22:54:45] <ljharb> sheetjs: it’s a weird requirement tho, why wouldn’t everything be in the public registry
[22:55:02] <ljharb> supply chain concerns aren’t solved in any way by a separate registry

[22:58:04] <Decker> when's es2xxx going to get user definable operators for classes? :)
[22:58:15] <Decker> that should result in all kinda confusion
[22:58:27] <qswz> it can become fragile if packages cn specify any registry
[22:59:06] <qswz> more possibilities of failures
[23:00:09] <Decker> well that's an excuse to try typescript
[23:01:06] <qswz> I don't even need classes

[23:53:58] <ThePhilgrim> Hey, I have a question.. What is the benefit of putting _ before properties to signify that they shouldn't be directly changed, and then have setter methods, instead of just changing _property directly?
[23:54:29] <ThePhilgrim> Also - Do most people actually use getters/setters in JS, or is it just in tutorials, and then I'll have to spend time unlearn that habit?
