[14:27:25] <flip214> luis: ALL-SLOTS-FOR-INSPECTOR vs. EMACS-INSPECT, any specific dis-/advantages?
[14:30:29] <flip214> or should I just extend CLASS-SLOTS? but SLOT-VALUE wouldn't work with the accessors
[14:49:56] <luis> flip214: I didn't know about ALL-SLOTS-FOR-INSPECTOR. Have you considered doing the extra bits inline in the aggregating object instead of when inspecting the sub-object?

[14:58:58] <flip214> well, a *FILE* has a lot of *LINES*, and when I zoom into these I still need *FILE* bound as well.
[14:59:21] <flip214> Just playing around right now, I'll show you my results for review when I've got some kind of solution.
