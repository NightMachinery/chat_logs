[01:12:26] <Hemish[m]> Switched to rEFInd boot loader
[01:12:31] <Hemish[m]> And it is working great
[01:14:59] <Hemish[m]> Now I realise grub was a headache in multibooting (managing multiple boot entries and regenerating them after changes took a lot of time), you don't need to update entries in refind, it automatically scans entries at boot, and supports scanning other os out of the box (recently grub disabled that option by default and needs to be enabled)
[01:16:03] <Hemish[m]> Required no configuration, just installed with refind-install command, I edited the default timeout and default entry to boot and boom it's done, as simple as that
[01:24:48] <Hemish[m]> > image.jpeg
[01:24:48] <Hemish[m]> thats why people say that "testing" should not be done in production environment (this person was literally messing around and testing version control in a code editor in his production environment). Why the hell did he even initialise the repo if he didnt knew what it was
[01:25:30] <Hemish[m]> <SurajKushwah[m]> "image.jpeg" <- The upper comment was a reply to this image
[05:17:56] <TelegramBridge[m> <NeoVoid[m]> "try again talking through the..." <- Ok
[06:02:57] <JB[m]> Hey @pystardust!
[06:02:57] <JB[m]>   nice to the point video
[06:02:57] <JB[m]> I like your style
[07:04:14] <Arya[m]> J B: join #gnulinuxindia-su on libera if you want
[07:31:58] <pystardust> JB[m]: thanks, I'll try making more
[07:54:51] <iamak[m]> <Hemish[m]> "Now I realise grub was a..." <- Is it faster than Grub?
[07:55:46] <Arya[m]> iamak[m]: use refind ig
[07:56:24] <iamak[m]> Huh?
[07:56:40] <iamak[m]> That doesn't answer my question 😅
[08:00:19] <Arya[m]> refind is probably faster
[08:02:27] <iamak[m]> Oh okay

[09:31:26] <Arya[m]> need to do a dual bot
[09:31:32] <Arya[m]> is this a good partitioning scheme
[09:39:21] <KarunM[m]> <Arya[m]> "2021-12-22T11:30:58,461140330+05..." <- where is the efi partition for linux
[09:39:32] <Arya[m]> one efi part is enough right
[09:39:40] <Arya[m]> the 100Mb one is windows efi part
[09:40:33] <KarunM[m]> ah ya that's ok i think. the guide I was following makes another one also so i was confused
[09:40:46] <KarunM[m]> <KarunM[m]> "like this" <- like this
[09:43:11] <Arya[m]> ok
[09:56:21] <Arya[m]> zstd: error 25 : Write error : No space left on device (cannot write compressed block)
[09:56:22] <Arya[m]> oof
[09:56:28] <Arya[m]> windows makes smoll efi

[10:11:04] <iamak[m]> Has anyone tried this? Does it work? It doesn't seem to work for me
[10:15:54] <Arya[m]> fuck
[10:15:59] <Arya[m]> i broke the ntfs partition
[10:16:03] <Arya[m]> time to reset windows
[10:17:07] <KarunM[m]> oof sorry to hear that :/
[10:17:53] <Arya[m]> thankfully i backed up my data
[10:18:18] <Arya[m]> i expected i will break something 😆
[10:18:19] <KarunM[m]> nice
[10:19:58] <KarunM[m]> my installation went ok, I installed grub bootloader but it's not being detected when I bootup. I'll try installing systemd this time, that had worked for me last time.
[10:20:54] <Arya[m]> probably did something wrong when resizing the partition with cfdisk
[10:32:15] <Arya[m]> flashing the iso rn
[10:33:39] <KarunM[m]> good luck bro

[11:12:22] <NeoVoid[m]> <Arya[m]> "lost current so had to stop" <- what kind of current?
[11:12:30] <Arya[m]> electricity
[11:12:38] <Arya[m]> my linux pc runs on ac
[11:12:41] <Arya[m]> no battery
[11:13:03] <relejek[m]> Arya[m]: same
[11:13:38] <relejek[m]> but i have ups
[11:13:46] <Arya[m]> lol noice
[11:13:49] <Arya[m]> ups is huge
[11:13:51] <Arya[m]> no space 
[11:14:13] <Arya[m]> current goes of really rarely so its not needed 4 me
[11:14:35] <NeoVoid[m]> Arya[m]: same here bro
[11:15:17] <NeoVoid[m]> relejek[m]: ups battery doesnt last
[11:16:55] <NeoVoid[m]> sometimes it gets corrupted 
[11:16:55] <NeoVoid[m]> and then you get only 30 secs to shutdown oc before it wores out.
[11:17:05] <NeoVoid[m]> s/oc/it/
[11:17:27] <Arya[m]> never had corruption issues
[11:17:32] <Arya[m]> idk if its btrfs
[11:17:33] <Arya[m]> or ssd
[11:17:40] <Arya[m]> does happen on hdd tho
[11:18:43] <NeoVoid[m]> <iamak[m]> "Is it good or bad" <- the more bigger the patch the more complixity of applying them especially when auto patch doesnt work.

[11:25:39] <NeoVoid[m]> <Arya[m]> "sheet need to deal with cortana" <- are you dual booting or something
[11:25:47] <Arya[m]> yeah
[11:25:52] <Arya[m]> its a different computer
[11:25:56] <Arya[m]> my main is arch
[11:26:36] <Hemish[m]> i uninstalled cortana
[11:26:44] <Hemish[m]> though my main os is arch
[11:26:46] <Arya[m]> this is first setup
[11:27:22] <Hemish[m]> winows is still there in my laptop for any normie or family member to use
[11:27:46] <Hemish[m]> but my father can easily use linux mint, so i have set linux mint to boot default, and whenever i boot, i boot to arch
[11:27:52] <Arya[m]> Hemish[m]: same thats why i need windows for too
[11:36:03] <NeoVoid[m]> <Hemish[m]> "but my father can easily use..." <- why having different distro for that when you can just configued another DE like cinnamon or xfce to be used for other users
[11:36:20] <Arya[m]> i plan on doing that too
[11:36:23] <Arya[m]> kde on arch
[11:36:28] <Arya[m]> i use sway just have kde installed
[11:37:04] <NeoVoid[m]> i generally have xfce session installed for guest users to use
[11:37:34] <NeoVoid[m]> this time xfce got error so i confugured compiz wm lol
[11:37:55] <NeoVoid[m]> with xfce panel and rofi applets
[11:38:09] <Arya[m]> kde will be easier imo
[11:38:13] <Arya[m]> ii anyways use ssdm
[11:38:15] <Arya[m]> sddm
[11:38:28] <NeoVoid[m]> kde is heavy on resources
[11:38:34] <Arya[m]> i have 8 gigs
[11:38:48] <NeoVoid[m]> thats good
[11:39:06] <NeoVoid[m]> i have to rely on 3gigs lol
[11:39:12] <Arya[m]> lol
[11:39:48] <NeoVoid[m]> people don't believe when i told them i have 3gigs ram
[11:39:57] <Arya[m]> lol 
[11:39:59] <Arya[m]> its weird ryt
[11:39:59] <NeoVoid[m]> they believe its not possible
[11:40:03] <Arya[m]> 4 6 and 8
[11:40:07] <Arya[m]> are the normal ones
[11:40:17] <NeoVoid[m]> yeah as its not standard
[11:40:48] <NeoVoid[m]> you can have any number it doesnt matter

[11:41:44] <Hemish[m]> I dont want seaparte DE packages on my arch system, i just use sway. Earlier i kept gnome for guest users, but linux mint is convenient as everything is separate. On my arch system, people tend to open my chrome and other things (and maintaining a different user id is tough for me) (basically it would cause bloat on my main system
[11:42:12] <NeoVoid[m]> even if its floating number
[11:42:39] <Arya[m]> ig chromium is enough 
[11:42:43] <Arya[m]> chromium + onlyoffice
[11:43:17] <Hemish[m]> why use onlyoffice separately, when it already bundles chromium, so just use it in your browser
[11:43:23] <NeoVoid[m]> Arya[m]: ?
[11:43:25] <NeoVoid[m]> Hemish[m]: right you don't want to see them your anime collections
[11:43:26] <NeoVoid[m]> xD

[11:44:35] <NeoVoid[m]> 😵 XD means this symbol right?
[11:44:42] <Arya[m]> create a new user
[11:44:48] <Arya[m]> NeoVoid[m]: no in element its 😆 
[11:45:17] <Hemish[m]> Arya[m]: but it would still require a DE package, probably xfce, but then i would have to customize xfce 
[11:45:33] <Arya[m]> just use kde 
[11:45:44] <NeoVoid[m]> Hemish[m]: it only takes one keybind ctrl+h to uncover your secret life 🤪
[11:45:47] <Arya[m]> i use sddm and kdenlive so its not like i will get millions of deps
[11:46:07] <NeoVoid[m]> Arya[m]: ohh laughing with closed eyes
[11:46:09] <Arya[m]> NeoVoid[m]: gpg is your frend
[11:46:30] <Arya[m]> cant you do gpg -d something.mp4 | mpv -
[11:46:31] <NeoVoid[m]> Arya[m]: you can put a password to directory with it?
[11:46:33] <Hemish[m]> its convenient to install linux mint on separate partition ( mujhe storage ki kami nahi hai kyonki main movies vagarah nahi dekhta, 1tb drive hai, usmein 30 gb partition par linux mint install kardiya, abhi bhi mere pass 700 gb ke around khaali hai

[11:47:17] <Hemish[m]> Arya[m]: nice
[11:47:38] <Arya[m]> wow windows is just using 32 gigs
[11:47:41] <Arya[m]> very much surprised
[11:47:44] <Hemish[m]> What matrix client are you all using?
[11:48:09] <Hemish[m]> Arya[m]: and yeah, my arch system is using 15 gb with whatever i need installed
[11:48:13] <NeoVoid[m]> Arya[m]: "just"
[11:48:26] <Arya[m]> schildichat (desktop) element (web browser) element mobile (android) fluffychat (ios for my mom) and gomuks(sometimes cli)
[11:48:28] <NeoVoid[m]> Hemish[m]: i use ement
[11:48:29] <Arya[m]> and neochat for testing
[11:48:41] <Arya[m]> ement didnt work correctly once
[11:48:43] <Arya[m]> and never tried it since
[11:48:47] <Arya[m]> sour grapes \xD
[11:48:54] <Hemish[m]> Arya[m]: i am using fluffy chat on both android and linux
[11:48:57] <Hemish[m]> element on browser
[11:49:08] <Arya[m]> lol 
[11:49:11] <NeoVoid[m]> Arya[m]: gotta try it its really convenient
[11:49:13] <Hemish[m]> i disacrded fractal, becuase it wasnt complete and lacked things
[11:49:17] <Arya[m]> fluffy doesnt have any customizations
[11:49:29] <Hemish[m]> thats why i like it
[11:49:35] <Hemish[m]> minimalist
[11:49:45] <Hemish[m]> and beautiful
[11:50:00] <Arya[m]> i also have sour grapes with gomuks
[11:50:06] <Arya[m]> once it literally spammed a channel
[11:50:07] <Arya[m]> idk why
[11:50:13] <Arya[m]> it really glitched out
[11:50:14] <Hemish[m]> never tried gomuks, would surely try it
[11:50:14] <NeoVoid[m]> for phone why don't just install termux and install cli ones
[11:50:19] <Arya[m]> and now it isnt loading all my messages
[11:50:29] <Arya[m]> NeoVoid[m]: not that chad \xD

[14:13:53] <NeoVoid[m]> s/ist/isnt/
[14:41:49] <iamak[m]> Idk what you are trying to do but from what I understand, you are trying to access `dir10` when only `dir1` and `dir2` exist
[14:46:13] <NeoVoid[m]> iamak[m]: I am trying to clone "dir1" directory and making 10 7 copies of them
[14:46:30] <NeoVoid[m]> s/10//
[14:46:38] <iamak[m]> Ah
[14:48:08] <iamak[m]> Doesn't work on mine either F
[14:50:31] <iamak[m]> According to bash expansions, the command becomes
[14:50:31] <iamak[m]> `cp -r dir1 dir2 dir3` till `dir10`
[14:50:54] <iamak[m]> `cp` only accepts single source and single destination

[14:52:51] <iamak[m]> >DESCRIPTION
[14:52:51] <iamak[m]> >      Copy SOURCE to DEST, or multiple SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.
[14:52:51] <iamak[m]> from `man cp`
[14:52:53] <NeoVoid[m]> <NeoVoid[m]> "image.jpeg" <- now i understand cp interepreting second argument as destination (which does not exist yet)
[14:53:19] <NeoVoid[m]> NeoVoid[m]: cp only works like this it needs source and destination
[14:53:24] <NeoVoid[m]> it can't clone
[14:53:26] <iamak[m]> That's not the issue. If the directory doesn't exist, `cp` creates one
[14:53:29] <telegram_8037364> <Arya[m]> "time to reset windows" <- kvm windows 7 bess
[14:53:58] <NeoVoid[m]> iamak[m]: then why its not working

[20:26:19] <glizzster[m]1> <NeoVoid[m]> "unnamed_file.mp4" <- the hek
[20:26:22] <glizzster[m]1> how is that possible
[20:26:41] <glizzster[m]1> Suraj Kushwah: bro have you ever tried artix?
[20:26:57] <glizzster[m]1> wait
[20:26:58] <glizzster[m]1> you have
[20:27:03] <glizzster[m]1> i have seen a video
[20:27:04] <Hemish[m]> glizzster[m]1: I installed it
[20:27:08] <glizzster[m]1> i cant rember
[20:27:12] <glizzster[m]1> Hemish[m]: damn
[20:27:14] <glizzster[m]1> hows it?
[20:27:26] <Hemish[m]> And now I am in process of installing all required applications and migrating fro. Arch
[20:27:38] <glizzster[m]1> pog
[20:27:47] <glizzster[m]1> tell me how is the experience
[20:27:52] <glizzster[m]1> after you startt using it
[20:28:01] <glizzster[m]1> i am also thinking to switch from arch to it
[20:28:23] <SurajKushwah[m]> glizzster[m]1: yes 4 5 months
[20:31:22] <glizzster[m]1> SurajKushwah[m]: you still on bsd or arch?
[20:31:28] <Hemish[m]> glizzster[m]1: It's good if you know how to manage openrc or runit or whatever init system you are using, another thing that would you need to know that you need to install seatd (if you use Wayland compositors) or install logind (if on xorg), and you to have to install init scripts for programs you need. For example, you instalm TeamViewer or iwd (intel wireless daemon), it only gives systemd init scripts. You need to install
[20:31:28] <Hemish[m]> respective <application>-<yourinitsystem> package from aur to install init scripts. For example I installed dbus, iwd, TeamViewer, but dbus-runit iwd-runit teamviewer-runit should also be installed for having init scripts for these programs
[20:32:05] <SurajKushwah[m]> glizzster[m]1: i use arch , freebsd on server, I still believe FreeBSD is a good choice for desktop but .. lot of changes
[20:32:14] <glizzster[m]1> Hemish[m]: shit
[20:32:15] <glizzster[m]1> sounds complicated
[20:32:16] <glizzster[m]1> but ill try on vm
[20:32:20] <glizzster[m]1> and have some experience
[20:32:24] <glizzster[m]1> then defo switch to it
[20:32:32] <glizzster[m]1> cuz systemd sox
[20:32:42] <Hemish[m]> glizzster[m]1: You would first have to read about which init system you would be choosing
[20:32:44] <glizzster[m]1> SurajKushwah[m]: oh thanks dude
[20:32:49] <Hemish[m]> Like how to manage services
[20:32:56] <glizzster[m]1> Hemish[m]: runit :)
[20:33:02] <glizzster[m]1> its fast = says luke
[20:33:58] <Hemish[m]> > <@glizzster:matrix.org> > <@hemish:matrix.org> You would first have to read about which init system you would be choosing
[20:33:58] <Hemish[m]> > 
[20:33:58] <Hemish[m]> > runit :)
[20:33:58] <Hemish[m]> Then you would surely approach this group for help, because there is a random bug in artix runit, which is not in void runit. When you install the system, and reboot. It gets stuck and doesn't show login Getty on try.
[20:34:09] <Hemish[m]> And I am gonna help at that time
[20:34:27] <Hemish[m]> This bug still exists, when I Installed day before yesterday
[20:34:44] <glizzster[m]1> Hemish[m]: F
[20:34:58] <Hemish[m]> glizzster[m]1: Yeah, it's also very simple to write init scripts for, you can write your own init scripts in 1-2 lines
[20:34:58] <glizzster[m]1> Hemish[m]: oh okay ❤️
[20:35:22] <Hemish[m]> Hemish[m]: Because I digged it out and solved it, and it literally took me 2 days
[20:36:07] <glizzster[m]1> pog
[20:36:27] <Hemish[m]> glizzster[m]1: What did exactly go wrong with systems with you? For me, I just prefer runit because runit scripts are easier to write and understand and file structure is simple as compared to systems
[20:36:30] <Hemish[m]> *systemd
[20:37:51] <Hemish[m]> Systemd I still ok and works out of the box
[20:38:04] <glizzster[m]1> Hemish[m]: nothing
[20:38:08] <glizzster[m]1> it just feels slow
[20:38:11] <glizzster[m]1> and bloated
[20:38:41] <glizzster[m]1> btw do you know what this command means ``reflector --latest 20 --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist --protocol https --download-timeout 5``
[20:44:53] <iamak[m]> <NeoVoid[m]> "can anyone tell what tech is..." <- I'm guessing that the pages have passive rfid chips in them. The handheld device has reads the tag, and plays the music accordingly. I could be wrong though
[20:52:11] <NeoVoid[m]> yeah he said something about magnetic ink
[20:53:51] <NeoVoid[m]> <Hemish[m]> "It's good if you know how to..." <- wow thats so incredible info you know about artix
[20:54:23] <NeoVoid[m]> i havent myself dig that much
[20:56:11] <NeoVoid[m]> <Hemish[m]> "It's good if you know how to..." <- thanks for wayland lead
[20:56:11] <NeoVoid[m]> I always wonder why i cant make wayland work
[20:57:01] <NeoVoid[m]> <Hemish[m]> "> <@glizzster:matrix.org> > <@..." <- is this in new iso?
[20:58:36] <NeoVoid[m]> can you tell what exactly wrong there?
[20:58:55] <NeoVoid[m]> and how do you fixed it
[21:21:22] <telegram_8037364> <glizzster[m]1> "hows it?" <- i'm using artix atm,  only difference is the init files of programs are packaged separately eg: on arch you would only have to install iwd and it comes with systemd init files on artix iwd and iwd-s6 or iwd-runit , etc...
[21:21:52] <telegram_8037364> it's same
[21:26:49] <telegram_8037364> <Hemish[m]> "> <@glizzster:matrix.org> > <@..." <- i'm using runit i dont have that problem
[21:29:39] <telegram_8037364> <Hemish[m]> "> <@glizzster:matrix.org> > <@..." <- oh you mean neofetch messing  up the getty prompt, where you can still type pass and login
[21:30:45] <telegram_8037364> saw that on one of luke's video, think they removed it on runnit , i didn't have neofetch on boot by default
[21:32:04] <telegram_8037364> s/on runnit//
[22:14:21] *** Quits: ramram (~ramram@157.47.244.73) (Quit: leaving)
[22:58:38] <glizzster[m]1> bruh how do i stop that it automatically creates ~/Downloads folder
[22:59:40] <glizzster[m]1> for no reason
[23:53:26] <Hemish[m]> <glizzster[m]1> "bruh how do i stop that it..." <- First kill any process that may potentially create this folder. The install xdg-user-dirs... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/084da29682b802220f8f04013247aa65c1826e11)

[23:55:32] <Hemish[m]> For example see my config, I didn't need public and templates directory, so I just kept them $HOME, and I wanted my downloads directory to be named "dl" so I named it there
[23:57:30] <Hemish[m]> By setting up all above, now browsers, file managers would all respect these (e.g. your file manager would show downloads icon on "dl" folder if it is set in user-dirs.dirs)
[23:57:30] <Hemish[m]> If such configuration is not present, and some application (like browser) tries to create downloads folder but if this configuration is set, the applications respect that
[23:57:58] <Hemish[m]> Btw my directory names are inspired from @[Suraj Kushwah] 
[23:58:41] <Hemish[m]> I saw his download directory named "dl" in some youtube video and found out it to be amazing
