[20:21:01] <Dus10> I think Azure is the way to go
[20:21:09] <rawtaz> why? curious
[20:21:12] <Dus10> enterprises are going Azure with a higher rate of adoption
[20:21:20] <Dus10> so, for work prospects, it seems to make sense
[20:21:29] <rawtaz> i think that makes sense, i'd agree with that observation

[20:22:09] <dodo> the cert looks super easy too. i mean, i think i've done everything that's in it, just not on azure
[20:22:20] <rawtaz> dodo: where are you looking?
[20:22:26] <Dus10> and use better tools that work with any of them :)
[20:22:30] <dodo> the official ms docs

[20:22:57] <Dus10> which cert?
[20:23:08] <rawtaz> exactly! which cert o,O
[20:23:09] <Dus10> there isn't one cert for Azure, nor one cert for AWS or Google

[20:26:27] <dodo> will have a look, thanks
[20:26:41] <Dus10> and since the Architect Expert has a common prerequisite of AZ-104
[20:26:43] <dodo> oh yeah
[20:26:46] <Dus10> so, I would lean towards 104
[20:27:18] <Dus10> although, I have the Azure Developer Associate (204), Architect Expert, and DevOps Expert
[20:27:33] <Dus10> that was before the prerequisite existed for Architect Expert, though
[20:27:49] <dodo> i mean, i'd rather learn that stuff on the job.. but currently i have no interesting offers.. so..
[20:27:54] <Dus10> I did the Architect first
[20:28:32] <rawtaz> so lower number == cooler?
[20:29:02] <Dus10> lower number == lower number
[20:29:03] <Dus10> it is just a number
[20:29:39] <rawtaz> so theres no logical system in their numbering of the courses then
[20:36:17] <Dus10> There is but it is just the hundreds number that is associated with a certificate
[20:36:47] <Dus10> it has changed over the years
[20:36:47] <Dus10> 100s is the admin associate
[20:36:54] <Dus10> 100, 101, 103, 104
[20:37:04] <Dus10> 300s are for architect Expert
[20:37:24] <Dus10> was 300, 301, then 303, 304, now it is only 305
[20:37:58] <Dus10> originally the 100/200 exams were associate, and 300/400 were expert
[20:38:08] <Dus10> but they have 500 series for security

[21:02:25] <justsomeguy> I've been teaching myself DevOps, linux, and programming recently. I'm about to spend a lot of time picking up a programming language, and I'm not sure which one to invest my time into. What do you think the most useful language(s) are to learn for writing back-end tooling and talking to AWS? (I was thinking that I should choose something that the major public cloud vendors have good APIs for.)
[21:07:45] <slaughter> My suggestion: learn JS. Everyone else's suggestion is probably python
[21:10:08] <dodo> i've coded in, like 10 languages.. yeah, python is easy to learn and very powerful
[21:10:20] <dodo> with js.. the ecosystem doesn't have a high quality imo
[21:11:31] <slaughter> Hard disagree, but would love to hear more on that ecosystem point dodo 
[21:11:42] * slaughter points to requirements.txt
[21:12:03] <dodo> i mean the available packages
[21:12:54] <justsomeguy> I know a little of both JS and Python, but haven't written anything big in either of them.
[21:12:57] <dodo> perl was so great in that regard.. too bad the language just withered away. python is the successfor for me. very high quality packages
[21:13:11] <dodo> perl/cpan
[21:13:58] <dodo> slaughter: fwiw, requirements are easy :D not sure what you meant
[21:14:30] <slaughter> It's a godawful way to handle dependencies
[21:14:48] <dodo> people keep complaining about requirements and what not.. i've been using pip-tools for 10 years or so and it just works
[21:15:05] <justsomeguy> Oh man, dependency management is kind of a mess in every language I've used (except maybe goland and rust).
[21:15:13] <dodo> yeah, don't edit requirements.txt by hand, ever
[21:15:57] <slaughter> But fr dodo what's wrong with the available packages for JS?
[21:16:07] <slaughter> Everything you could ever want is out there
[21:16:24] <kwilczynski> https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/
[21:16:44] <dodo> slaughter: in my experience python packages are just higher quality, better documented, tested etc

[21:18:21] <dodo> cool :) glad it works for you
[21:18:51] <slaughter> I'm glad we can all be happy

[21:24:04] <kwilczynski> LOL

[21:24:15] <dodo> whatever makes you happy :)
[21:25:23] <slaughter> 5) sure, you can do all that in python...but should you really be making webpages in python? Does anyone really want to deal with flask? Have you seen the average python code people put out?
[21:25:33] <slaughter> It does make me happy
[21:25:50] <dodo> average coders write average code..
[21:26:32] <slaughter> And ML PhDs write amazing code that's impossible to read. And really good python devs write really clever code that I've never found great to work with
[21:27:10] <dodo> godd devs write readable code. clever != good
[21:27:12] <dodo> good
[21:27:17] <slaughter> Oh and if you really hate yourself you can use TypeScript and get all that. I guess python has typing now, though, so if that's your thing it can't be worse than TS
[21:27:37] <dodo> i always say, if you want typing, use a typed language. ffs
[21:27:44] <slaughter> I agree with that
[21:27:48] <slaughter> TS is the bane of my existence

[21:32:29] <kwilczynski> Scala.
[21:32:41] <slaughter> perl was my "first" programming language (I wrote quests for a game with it), but was already dead at that time. I always wonder if I would have liked it in a professional context
[21:32:45] <kwilczynski> Holy crap I hate Scala developers.
[21:33:39] <kwilczynski> slaughter: I still have a handy collection of Perl one-liners handy for some systems work. :)

[21:58:46] <Dus10> floats use what was considered a binary consistent way of being defined
[22:00:15] <rawtaz> uh. Go would be the obvious answer to that guy
[22:00:25] <Dus10> 2 is 10, 1 is 1â€¦ things double as you move leftâ€¦. so they halve as you move rightâ€¦ so the first binary vale to the right of the decimal position is 0.5, then 0.25, 0.125â€¦
