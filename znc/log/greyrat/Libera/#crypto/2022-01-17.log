[19:26:44] <user0x0> easy for the imagination to run wild. I was mainly curious if vulnerabilities were found it.  Verycrypt seems to be the best replacement
[19:27:22] <MacGyver> veracrypt, I assume?
[19:27:50] <user0x0> Ya, that's what I'm playing around with now
[19:27:57] <joe7057> I believe veracrypt was originally a fork of truecrypt
[19:28:42] <MacGyver> And iirc the audit done on veracrypt didn't find anything and considering veracrypt was a fork with auditable changes to the original codebase, that puts *some* modicum of trust in that truecrypt wasn't vulnerable at the time of discontunation.
[19:28:54] <MacGyver> discontinuation*
[19:29:14] <user0x0> I didn't know Veracrypt was audited, that
[19:29:22] <user0x0> that's good to know*
[19:29:34] <MacGyver> There were "concerns" with the original code.
[19:30:06] <MacGyver> But no clear indications of backdooring or similar.
[19:30:40] <user0x0> If the original developers of TrueCrypt found a vulnerability that no one else was aware of then it would also be present in the VeraCrypt fork correct?
[19:31:08] <MacGyver> Yes, but that vulnerability would have had to have survived several audits and public scrutiny since then.
[19:31:40] <MacGyver> Afaik nothing was published about the reasons, but there are other reasons for prompt discontinuation of the project possible.
[19:32:07] <MacGyver> E.g. they were about to be forced to introduce vulnerabilities.
[19:32:35] <user0x0> I read that also. Interesting situation
[19:32:54] <MacGyver> If that *is* the case, we probably will never know.
[19:34:21] <MacGyver> I've personally not really seen the usecase of {true,vera}crypt since I started using LUKS on LVM volumes.
[19:34:36] <MacGyver> As in, there's ways to just avoid the doubt.
[19:35:29] <user0x0> I'm just learning about cryptography and wanted to try it out but then fell into the rabbit hole of all the truecrypt speculation 
[19:36:06] <MacGyver> (Yes, I'm aware of the concept of hidden volumes and will counter you that they do not actually give you what people like to refer to as "plausible deniability". At best they get you in trouble for not unlocking the hidden volume that law enforcement believes to be there, whether it is or not.)
[19:37:49] <user0x0> I'm guessing at some point forced decrpytion by law will become a major question in the future
[19:39:32] <MacGyver> Some countries already have mandatory decryption laws.
[19:39:35] <MacGyver> With jail terms.
[19:39:44] <MacGyver> U.K. is one, iirc.
[19:41:31] <user0x0> The TrueCrypt wiki has some interesting cases about authorities trying to get access to certain peoples encrypted drives 
[19:41:58] <user0x0> One of them was about Snowden documents, held by someone else though

[20:49:46] <user0x0> Down near the bottom of the page there is a section on security concerns and also legal cases. both have good information 
[20:52:01] <user0x0> TimMc do you know if there is something similar to LUKS for BSD?
[20:54:11] <TimMc> No idea, I don't use BSD.
[20:55:53] <Bostik> I know that there is _some_ kind of FDE available, a friend used to have a completely encrypted netbsd laptop and booted it off of a remote volume in his gadget wristwatch
