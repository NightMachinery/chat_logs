[00:39:34] <pyzozord> hello, what's the best way to have newest go always installed on ubuntu?
[00:41:53] <b0nn> pyzozord: I have a bot that watches the Go github repository and I watch for tags - that tells me when a new release is coming
[00:42:32] <b0nn> But the *best* way is to monitor the mailing list for release announcements (they can come up to 48 hours after a tag has been committed)
[00:42:50] <pyzozord> I wanted to apt-install golang but that metapackage is set to go 1.13. I see there is 1.16 availabe in apt too, but I see on the website 1.17
[00:43:40] <b0nn> There's always going to be a delay between the release and a package maintainer updating the apt repos
[00:44:55] <pyzozord> right that's true. Are there important changes between 1.16 and 1.17? Maybe I can just live with 1.16 for now
[00:45:31] <b0nn> https://go.dev/doc/devel/release
[00:46:00] <edrocks> actually a release just came out on mailing list minutes ago
[00:46:21] <edrocks> 1.17.6 https://groups.google.com/g/golang-nuts/c/OEfdz5ar5-U

[00:50:15] <pyzozord> oh in nodejs there is a tool called nvm "node version manager" which lets you download and switch different versions of node, is there something like that for go?

[00:50:47] <edrocks> pyzozord yes but I've never used it https://github.com/moovweb/gvm
[00:50:52] <LiENUS> theres also gotip
[00:51:24] <LiENUS> https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/dl/gotip though gotip is more for trying beta versions
[00:51:46] <LiENUS> you could probably use gotip to download an older  version though
[00:52:05] <LiENUS> though with go's backwards compatibility promise there's not a lot of reason to use anything other than latest and gotip master
[00:52:42] <mrig> go mod regulates the version too, if I'm not mistaken, go mod being ones own personal package manager.
[00:53:41] <LiENUS> if you need a different version of go you're either doing something you shouldn't be, or you have a job that uses a customized go branch in which case they probably have build and install procedure to follow for their branch

[00:56:24] <mrig> I've not needed it yet, am rather intrigued as I've not come across it before, i'll have a read.
[00:56:27] <b0nn> mrig: Are you saying that the go version in a go.moddetermines the version that your system uses to build/run that project?
[00:57:11] <b0nn> I mean, when go.mod was first coming out it used to put the wrong damned version in and I was still able to build the project
[00:57:41] <mrig> I build on the host, and keep a git repo there, when I push to it then I know that the code will run as my mod file is limiting my use of any new features, I am speculating there though.
[00:58:01] <mrig> so the compiler is making sure that it is compatible.
[00:58:43] <mrig> Oh it could be that I'm not using any newer features of the language too.
[00:58:45] <b0nn> hmm I might do some experiments later
[00:59:26] <mrig> yes, oh let me know I'd be curious to hear how that goes; I'm working on assumption at the moment.
[00:59:41] <LiENUS> what do you mean so you know that your code will run?
[00:59:46] <LiENUS> compile or run?
[01:00:08] <mrig> compile, just ease to say run when it compiles so fast :)
[01:00:08] <LiENUS> if it builds it should just in general build and run as long as you use the same libc, most distros use the same libc only alpine uses a different one
[01:00:31] <b0nn> Uh, no
[01:00:36] <mrig> no libc only go
[01:00:57] <mrig> I'm not using cgo for this one.
[01:01:10] <LiENUS> there are some libc ties even without cgo
[01:01:20] <LiENUS> if you use anything in net iirc you're tied to libc

[04:45:16] <fizzie> It's not really machine-independent, no; the output for amd64 is quite different from arm64.
[04:45:18] <fizzie> I've only used it experimentally, but when I did do an SIMD-enhanced version of a thing (that worked, but wasn't really worth it) I think I mostly used that "quick guide" plus someone's blog post.
[04:45:48] <fizzie> Possibly https://blog.sgmansfield.com/2017/04/a-foray-into-go-assembly-programming/ (it looks vaguely familiar), though could've been something else too.

[04:51:31] <fizzie> I mostly just pretended I was writing regular x86-64 assembly except all uppercase and with wonky register names. But this was specifically in the context of SIMDing it up. Writing more control-flow-and-logic-related code might be different.

[05:14:30] <greeb> I read go.dev/doc/code, but I don't understand the logic behind the module naming. In the example, what is "example/user" meant to convey? A relative path? An example domain without a TLD for demonstration purposes? Could I just name it hey/wow/look/a/module/i/am/a/user/hello?
[05:17:01] <LiENUS> i believe it is best to use a domain in place of example it was discussed in here because it helps avoid conflicting with other libs even for a quick test
[05:17:24] <LiENUS> anything you plan to publish you'd put the location of your repository there, for ex github.com/greeb/mylib
[05:17:42] <fizzie> By convention there's "always" at least one `.` in the first component, which also makes it never conflict with the standard library (which never does).
[05:17:51] <greeb> that's what I figured, and the doc does mention that. the initial module naming throws off the reader, imo.
[05:18:41] <fizzie> I've been using "example.org/test" as a test. And the playground multi-file example uses "play.ground/foo".
[05:18:47] <LiENUS> i usually just use my github.com/myname/whatever whether i plan to publish or not, it's easy enough then to just kick it up to github in a private repo if i think i might want to come back to it later
[05:19:25] <LiENUS> if its single file i just go run file.go
[05:19:53] <fizzie> Yeah, the "example.org/test" was for working out "how do corner cases of modules work?" style IRC questions really.
[05:22:56] <LiENUS> would a full filesystem path work there /home/user/mymodule
[05:23:44] <LiENUS> that would almost certainly be a bad idea...
[05:24:00] <fizzie> Nah, it's more abstract than that. Filesystem paths can really only go in go.mod `replace` directive on the right side of the =>.
[05:24:24] <LiENUS> yeah trying now it just hangs
[05:24:54] <fizzie> Kind of odd that the pre-modules version of the tutorial used $GOPATH/src/github.com/user/hello (even though in GOPATH-style development, "example/user" kind of would've been just fine), while the module-aware version doesn't.
[05:25:32] <LiENUS> i do not miss pre module development

[10:12:01] <williampiv> LiENUS: I like GoLand, but if you want something free-er VSCode has worked well for me in the past. And then vim works well too, if you're looking for something more lightweight (and less IDEish)
[10:12:43] <LiENUS> i'm use to nano but changing environments figured i'd give an ide a try

[10:16:05] <williampiv> I originally found vim daunting to start using, but as soon as I committed the time to the original learning curve, I wondered why it had taken my so long to use it. vim-go is pretty nice. for sure take the time too to get your customizations in there too so it feels comfortable
[10:17:11] <LiENUS> i think my bigger hangup will be remapping the muscle memory to get terminal up quick

[10:56:38] <LiENUS> https://go.dev/blog/using-go-modules
[10:57:48] <LiENUS> you'll have to provide a module path to mod init. for playing around example.com/module will work. if its something you'll put on github or the like you would use your repo path
[10:58:23] <LiENUS> i like to use my repo path any time im moving being go run main.go even if im just testing just in case i want to push it up to github to come back to later

[16:56:28] <j416> huoy99: not sure what you mean; in the way you wrote it cleanup will happen all the time
[16:56:50] <fizzie> huoy99: Receiving from a `nil` channel blocks forever (or in `select` terms, never selects the case), so after you've gotten one receive from the closed channel, you can put `nil` in the variable holding it, and then that case will never be picked again.
[16:57:00] <fizzie> As long as you're sure other logic in the loop will eventually cause it to terminate.
[16:57:44] <fizzie> (Based on what I assume the real situation looks like, didn't really follow that example.)
[16:57:51] <j416> huoy99: the select blocks until one of the channels is ready, so for + select is usually ok

[16:59:11] <huoy99> j416: yeah it's intentional. so that will run all the time and run the cleanup as well
[16:59:47] <huoy99> fizzie: thanks, but not sure if setting it to nil will work as i actually have several of these loops going waiting on the same closed channel. sorry for not adding that to the example

[17:00:37] <huoy99> fizzie: but actually thanks i might be able to work with that
[17:01:13] <huoy99> actually no, because it won't get called again for the other go routines
[17:01:34] <j416> huoy99: also might want to think about whether cleanup and the channel c are related, or if it should be separated
[17:01:38] <fizzie> Well, possibly you can use a different variable for that loop.
[17:01:43] <j416> I don't understand what your use-case is so hard to tell
[17:01:56] <fizzie> That's initially set to the shared channel, and replaced with a `nil` when appropriate.
[17:02:31] <huoy99> fizzie: oh you can switch it out per go routine? would you mind showing an example?
[17:03:00] <fizzie> Something around the lines of `close := sharedCloseChannel; for { select { case <-close: close = nil; /* trigger cleanup tasks */; /* other cases */ } }`
[17:03:06] <fizzie> Can't quite make a real example right now.
[17:03:21] <huoy99> ohh i see
[17:03:32] <huoy99> yeah that could work. thanks again

[22:16:35] <fikran> so that I'm not passing the same string multiple times.

[22:18:28] <ikke> I don't think so, as it's also a source of bugs, so I think they explicitly require the amount of format strings to match the amount of arguments

[22:19:12] <ikke> it works with explicit indexes
