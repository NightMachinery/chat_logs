[12:57:46] <PMunch> federico3, got any good suggestions for a Bluetooth chip I can program in Nim?

[15:52:33] <PMunch> Hmm, found the EMB1061 which seems great. But looks like programming it would be hell, and it's almost impossible to get here for an okay price
[16:29:20] <federico3> good question, I always stayed away from BT
[16:31:02] <federico3> PMunch: cheaper than esp32?
[16:31:37] <federico3> oh but BL602 has bluetooth as well
[16:33:09] <PMunch> Well I wanted something smaller..
[16:33:55] <PMunch> I guess I could get a "raw" ESP32
[16:34:06] <PMunch> As in not on a breakout board
[16:35:12] <PMunch> Coming from programming with Attiny85s the ESP32 just feels so overkill :P
[16:35:57] <federico3> what's the use case?
[16:37:07] <PMunch> Small remote sensor
[16:37:41] <PMunch> I might just go Attiny85 and 433mhz module, and have a base-station that makes the 433Mhz available to a computer
[16:43:37] <federico3> if you buy discrete modules the price might be relatively similar to a bt/serial module
[16:43:57] *** Joins: arkurious (~arkurious@user/arkurious)
[16:45:01] <PMunch> That's true
[16:45:45] <PMunch> It just feels weird to combine an Attiny85 with a Cortex M3/M0 based bluetooth chip that is just sitting there speaking serial..
[16:45:56] <PMunch> And have all the logic on the Attiny85
[16:46:42] <federico3> what's the context?
[16:49:03] <PMunch> I just want a small remote temperature sensor. The idea is to make a small sensor with wireless charging, a small temperature probe, and some kind of communication to be able to read the data. Reason I was looking at Bluetooth is that it would be nice if it could communicate with a phone and not only a computer.
[16:49:30] <federico3> with a custom pcb?
[16:51:54] <PMunch> Potentially in the future, but for now I'm soldering modules
[16:59:41] <federico3> https://d.lij.uno/misc-nrf24-ble.html  ?
[17:02:03] <PMunch> Ooh, that seems promising
[17:02:19] <PMunch> I think I even have one of those lying around at home
[17:10:06] <PMunch> Hmm, unfortunately I won't be able to configure the probe to do anything, so all logic has to be done receiver side, but other than that I might get away with this :P

[19:11:09] <nisstyre> Can the ESP32 be programmed in Nim easily?
[19:11:19] <nisstyre> I would assume you need to be able to compile code for it somehow
