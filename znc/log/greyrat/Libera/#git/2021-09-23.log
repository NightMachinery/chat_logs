[03:21:54] <nedbat> Moult: you could merge c and then cherry-pick e
[03:21:56] <Moult> nedbat: one solution which works is git merge x, git merge y, but that creates lots of commits. i'm not sure how to select a range of commits. i've tried git merge x..y but it says "x..y not something we can merge"

[03:26:24] <nedbat> right
[03:28:26] <Moult> nedbat: i guess i could simply cherry pick ranges of commits that i want. what is the downside of doing a cherry pick?
[03:29:32] <nedbat> Moult: do you mind if i ask you about these branches? Are they meant to live for a long time? why do you need the same commits on two different branches?
[03:30:16] <nedbat> Moult: the downside is that it can be hard to see the relationship between the two "same" commits in two places.
[03:30:28] <Moult> nedbat: sure, one branch is a version 6 of the software, another is version 7.
[03:30:44] <nedbat> Moult: ok, so this is backporting fixes?

[10:22:15] <tsujp> I've got a branch which has commit FOO and commit BAR with some commits inbetween I want to squash such that FOO..BAR are now one commit.

[10:27:54] <osse> tsujp: is BAR before the merge as well?

[18:47:42] <j416> elibrokeit: what is origin? did you set it correctly?
[18:47:58] <gnoo> harpia: as i understand, you want to use both of those keys as two different users. both of those keys are registered on remote, have commit access and both of them individually work with ssh -v -i ~/.ssh/id_file example_url right? if so then it seems weird to not work...
[18:48:17] <j416> if origin somehow ended up pointing at your own repo, you can delete like that
[18:49:07] <j416> elibrokeit: though, if you are trying to push something and not delete the remote branch, your syntax seems off
[18:49:38] <elibrokeit> well, if I push refs/notes/signatures/tar.gz to the remote, then https://git.sr.ht picks that up and starts offering .asc files for download. So I would imagine my origin remote is not set incorrectly
[18:49:48] <j416> probably why I didn't recognize it; because you say you are pushing not nothing
[18:49:58] <elibrokeit> also, I mentioned this fetch = refspec for a reason :D
[18:50:09] <j416> elibrokeit: git remote -v

[19:23:49] <elibrokeit> refs/notes/* is essentially a branch. git push a branch, and it typically updates refs/remotes/origin/* too as the local tracking branch
[19:24:18] <elibrokeit> comparing it to refs/tags/* may not be the best comparison
[19:24:57] <elibrokeit> e.g. you cannot checkout a tag, only dereference it to a commit and checkout the detached commit

[19:55:38] <ikke> git history does not really make it easy / straightforward to go foward in history, only backwards
[19:56:50] <shush> What if I searched for all merge commits with a specific message and then filter those by the ones which track back to a particular branch?
[19:57:32] <shush> I have a workflow that I use often in my team which is to create future commits if a feature depends on another feature that is not yet merged into the main branch.

[20:00:32] <shush> I want to stop using tags, and make my strategy work without any tags

[20:11:57] <shush> It's a way of building on a merge commit that isn't there _yet_
[20:12:30] <shush> The prefix helps with the workflow so we can constrain PRs from merging future commits

[20:18:14] <rewt> shush, for all merge commits whose message start with "future!", check if the 2nd parent is the branch you're after

[20:18:40] <shush> How do I check the parent?
[20:18:51] <shush> How do I query for this?
[20:19:01] <rewt> or if the branch name is in the message, just look for the merge commit with the message "future! branch-name"
[20:19:38] <shush> rewt: There may be more than merge commit with "future! branch-name"

[23:12:28] <anddam> why was it introduced in first place?
[23:13:51] <ikke> Because of the perceived double role of checkout that could confuse new users
[23:15:08] <ikke> 1) switch branches
[23:15:22] <ikke> 2) retrieve files from commits and put them in the working tree
[23:15:28] <ikke> (or the index)

[23:20:35] <anddam> will checkout lose the ability to switch branches?

[23:25:12] <mackerman> Unlikely. checkout to change branches is a common task for several million people.

[23:29:29] <mackerman> Even if it did change, with aliases one could make "git co"  do the relevant switch command.

[23:47:59] <anddam> I figured
[23:48:06] <anddam> so there's an additional source of confusion
