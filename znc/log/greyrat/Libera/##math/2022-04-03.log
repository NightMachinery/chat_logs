[02:25:02] <Jacques> How can I find the zariski closure of the set S = {(x,y) in R^2 | x^2 + y^2 <= 4} ?
[02:25:03] <Jacques> I tried considering a more simple problem first: the set {(x,y) | x^2 + y^2 = 4}. This is the circle, the boundary, of the above set. So I notice that if I vary the constant: x^2 + y^2 - c = 0, then this expands or shrinks the circle. So I should try to parameterize this inequality.
[02:25:03] <Jacques> I consider a^2cos(t)+a^2sin^2(t) = a^2 <= 4 => -2 <= a <= 2. Okay...
[02:25:04] <Jacques> So what is the ideal of our set with this parameterization? I(S) = {f in R[t] | f(t) = a^2cos(t) + a^2sin(t), -2 <= a <= 2, a in R } ?

[02:42:58] <Fangs> Jacques: don't be so sure... their question had strict inequality but yours had a strict one
[02:43:33] <Fangs> Jacques: I dont know how containment goes, so either the closure is in {(x,y) | x^2 + y^2 = 4} or the circle is in the closure

[02:45:03] <Fangs> right
[02:45:05] <Jacques> the strict vs not-strict inquality does not matter I think.
[02:45:35] <Jacques> but, now my question is that of a calculus one
[02:45:41] <Fangs> yeah just make sure you account for that and check your technique goes through. so its a good opportunity to see how you can use their trick here (I mean its almost verbatim I think)
[02:45:43] <Jacques> how come they can write x = t and y = at

[02:46:51] <Fangs> I think the motivation is that x = t , y = at has a very simple polynomial equation
[02:47:15] <Fangs> or if you plug it in a polynomial f(x(t),y(t)) you get some polynomial F(t)
[02:47:21] <Fangs> and polynomial in 1 variables are easy

[02:48:56] <Fangs> Jacques: in calculus if a all of a function's directional derivative (parameterized by lines) at the origin exists, it doesn't have to be differentiable
[02:49:27] <Fangs> but if you are just showing its not differentiable, I think if you *can* find a line where its directional derivative doesn't exists, then the function is not differentiable at the origin
[02:50:12] <Jacques> I don't know why you discuss derivatives
[02:50:16] <Fangs> so I guess its a bit like that... you can't really find all polynomials by looking at those that are zero for all a in f(t,at) at your set
[02:50:42] <Jacques> I think the point is that what they wrote is just **a** parameterization
[02:50:52] <Jacques> anyway, thank you for your help and time!

[02:52:59] <Jacques> perhaps. But I do not recall the specific statement
[02:53:12] <Fangs> I just remembered it being really hard
[02:53:25] <Jacques> new question: can we do an example of a polynomial quotient ring with an infinite field? I'm having a little trouble with understanding it well
[02:53:50] <Fangs> what do you mean
[02:54:49] <Jacques> it is defined as the set of equivalence relations on the ring. So,
[02:54:50] <Jacques> k[x_1, ...,x_n] / I = {[f] | f in k[x_1, ..., x_n]}
[02:55:13] <Fangs> oh
[02:55:15] <Jacques> and [f] is the equivalence relation. So, [f] = {g in k[x_1, ..., x_n] | f equiv g mod I}
[02:55:24] <Fangs> Jacques: just take R[x,y]/(y)
[02:55:35] <Jacques> Okay, one moment.
[02:55:42] <Fangs> you can show this is isomorphic to R[x]

[04:06:26] <YoungPotato> I have a question about an inverted U relationship. Consider this inverted U graph with age on the x-axis and performance on the y-axis.

[04:08:45] <YoungPotato> How do I calculate the optimal range, assuming the optimal range is defined as the range between two points on the x-axis where the decrease in y becomes more flat, or the increase in y starts to ramp up.

[04:08:54] <YoungPotato> Not sure how else to express this.

[04:31:01] <dauggy> just a sec pls
[04:31:32] <ihate> recall: if A is a subset of B, then int_A ≤ int_B when integrating something positive.
[04:31:41] <zeroc00l0> Does it make sense to say, "Where f(x) = x + 1, f is irreflexive."?  Or not, because f isn't a relation.
[04:32:12] <ihate> functions are relations
[04:32:34] <zeroc00l0> Ok, so that proposition is coherent?
[04:33:07] <ihate> i don't know enough logic to answer that surely
[04:33:08] <zeroc00l0> And I can say stuff like, "Where g(x) = x, g is symmetric."?
[04:33:55] <ihate> so here irreflexive would mean f(x) =/=x for an x?
[04:34:36] <ihate> for any*
[04:34:58] <zeroc00l0> Yeah.
[04:36:44] <PlanckWalk> monkeyPlus: I don't know what you mean by that.  Do you have an example?
[04:36:45] <zeroc00l0> As you said, my set theory text introduced functions as a proper subset of relations, so it seems to me that it is likely coherent, but idk.
[04:37:09] <monkeyPlus> like 3,5,7, the interval between is 2, (3,5,7 meaning sequence of odds)
[04:37:13] <PlanckWalk> Like, 11 and 97 are odd numbers, but the difference between them isn't 2
[04:37:22] <monkeyPlus> no no i meant sequence
[04:37:25] <PlanckWalk> Ah I see
[04:37:29] <monkeyPlus> why is it 2?!
[04:37:41] <PlanckWalk> Because it can't be 1
[04:37:43] <ihate> zeroc00l0 what does it mean to be coherent?
[04:37:46] <monkeyPlus> :)
[04:37:52] <monkeyPlus> oh  i see
[04:37:56] <PlanckWalk> And if yuo add 2 to any odd number you get another odd number
[04:38:21] <zeroc00l0> That the proposition is a well formed sentence in my theory.
[04:38:22] <monkeyPlus> ok...
[04:38:43] <zeroc00l0> That the sequence of symbols is a well formed sentence in my theory.*
[04:39:01] <ihate> right. so "can I use this adjective for relations to desribe a function"?
[04:39:07] <Fangs> monkeyPlus: if you think of an even number 'x' as a number that is two times some other number
[04:39:14] <Fangs> i.e. x = 2*n for some integer n
[04:39:23] <zeroc00l0> Yes, that is the question I am asking.

[07:07:04] <Fangs> I couldn't really find out if it has krull dim 1 or not just by using first principles.. apparently there's some theorem about dim R = dim R/I if I satisfies some properties, but this is not part of the class, so I didn't know such a theorem exists

[07:07:21] <Fangs> besides C[x,y] has dim 2
[07:08:08] <Fangs> is it obvious that its 'integrally closed' that's the issue?. found out by looking at eisenbud reading about singularity, and wikipedia's page on integral closure saying C[t^2,t^3] is not integrally closed...

[07:09:30] <Fangs> so naively if you go to desmos, and just parameterize the real cuve you see that x = t^3, y = t^2 works as a parameterization, so theres a ring hom from there to C[t^2,t^3]. then wikipedia says t is in C(t) its field of fractions but t is not in the original ring
[07:10:21] <Fangs> ok... w/e.. so x/y is in the fraction field and integral over the base ring since (x/y)^2 = x^2/y^2 = y^3/y^2 = y, so if A is the ring, t^2 - y is the polynomial you want here in A[t]

[07:43:28] <korvos> Does the order in which the fractions are listed in a partial fraction expansion matter? I have found that when I do these problems my intermediate steps are correct, but the final answer is wrong due to the order of my fraction terms. Am I missing some rule?
[07:44:11] <ihate> depends what you mean by order
[07:44:26] <ihate> for something like 1/(x+a)(x+b), it doesn't matter
[07:47:39] <korvos> my original problem was (x^4+1)/(x(x^2+1)). i got the problem right in the end but the problem was the order of my setup. so i was wondering if i should do the setup in some order
[07:48:48] <korvos> the setup that worked was A/x + (Bx+C)/(x^2 +1) + (Dx+E)/((x^2+1)^2), but when i wrote it by hand i may not have put them in this same order
[07:50:01] <ihate> what do you mean by order? x+y = y+x
[07:50:34] <ihate> writing  A/x + (Bx+C)/(x^2 +1) + (Dx+E)/((x^2+1)^2) and  A/x + (Dx+E)/((x^2+1)^2) + (Bx+C)/(x^2 +1)  will give the same results.
[07:51:09] <korvos> right so i must be doing something wrong with distributing or factoring out a (-1) perhaps somewhere
[07:51:57] <ihate> now if you write (Ax+B)/x + C/(x^2+1) + D/(x^2+1)^2, you may run into issues
[07:52:59] <ihate> do you really mean something like writing 1/x + 1/y versus 1/y + 1/x?
[07:53:01] <korvos> yeah those parts of the rules seem straightforward; i think i am getting signs wrong somewhere along the way. its not in the resulting linear system, either, because i verified it

[08:42:07] <Fangs> these are words in eisenbud..
[08:43:05] <isekaijin> You can use partial derivatives to test whether a variety is singular at a point, but the problem is that, a priori, that depends on an embedding into affine space.
[08:43:13] <isekaijin> You'd have to prove that this doesn't depend on the embedding.
[08:43:15] <greenbagels> ill test whether you're singular, bb
[08:43:19] <isekaijin> Which is such an annoyance.
[08:43:41] <isekaijin> (In fact, it doesn't depend on the embedding. Zariski proved this.)
[08:44:24] <Fangs> these are annoying
[08:44:41] <isekaijin> Anyhow. As I said, if X = Spec(R), where R is an integrally closed domain, then X doesn't have any singularities in codimension 1. In particular, if X is a curve, then X is smooth.

[14:40:58] <cadmio> yes I did

[14:42:31] <Fangs> (checking for correctness is way more work, haha)
[14:43:20] <Fangs> this is more for greenbagels, if you allign cadmio's table so that the 1s are in the diagonals, then you'd have an actual cyclic permutation I think

[18:17:50] <vando> PlanckWalk But should I keep the boundaries as they are or simplify as I did in the mathb.in?
[18:18:00] <PlanckWalk> Definite keep as they are.
[18:18:05] <PlanckWalk> The mathb.in makes no sense
[18:18:52] <vando> Hmm, well as in this picture https://i.imgur.com/XqyhEYI_d.webp?maxwidth=760&fidelity=grand. I'm not sure I follow 100%
[18:19:20] <vando> "sin(i/m)/(nm)  doesn't involve j at all, so you just multiply by how many j's there are" Multiply sin(i/m)/(nm) by j?
[18:19:26] <PlanckWalk> No
[18:19:35] <PlanckWalk> Multiply by how many terms there are in that sum.
[18:20:04] <PlanckWalk> It's just  sin(i/m)/(nm) + sin(i/m)/(nm) + sin(i/m)/(nm) + sin(i/m)/(nm) + sin(i/m)/(nm) + ... + sin(i/m)/(nm)
[18:20:08] <vando> Oh yea you right.
[18:20:38] <vando> But yea then that's sin(i/m)/(nm) * j
[18:20:41] <vando> ?
[18:20:50] <PlanckWalk> One term for each integer value of j in the range between  0 and n cos(i/m)
[18:21:22] <vando> Oh

[18:22:06] <PlanckWalk> Oh, just the notation.  yes
[18:22:24] <vando> But why floor(n cos(i/m) + 1)?
[18:22:29] <vando> Ah nvm.
[18:22:40] <PlanckWalk> If  n cos(i/m) = 0.3 for example, there's only 1 term.
[18:22:45] <vando> Yep.
[18:23:41] <PlanckWalk> However, note that  0 <= i <= m, so  0 <= i/m <= 1

[20:02:41] <isekaijin> vando: Do i and j range over integers here?
[20:03:12] <isekaijin> vando: What's making me doubt is the fact that the inner sum's upper bound is n*cos(i/m), which isn't an integer in general.

[20:05:28] <isekaijin> cadmio: Are you sure about that?
[20:05:49] <isekaijin> cadmio: y^3 + y^2 - 4y - 4 = (y^2 - 4) (y + 1) = (y - 2) (y + 2) (y + 1)

[20:06:41] <isekaijin> y^3 + y^2 - 4y - 4 = (y^2 - 4) (y + 1) = (y - 2) (y + 2) (y + 1)
