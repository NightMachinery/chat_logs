[11:50:35] <susi_> I have a Question.
[11:53:12] <susi_> I'd like to have a keyword for not putting the search url into history, like "nohistory dolphin penis", and it would act as "dolphin penis"<ENTER> inserted in url bar, but somehow block the search engine url from going into history?
[11:53:34] <susi_> I'd think it would be achievable with a bookmarklet, but I'm no JS dude or anything
[11:55:36] <susi_> it seems one can't have 'private' tabs (w/o extensions)?
[12:37:15] *** Quits: Meatshinobi (~Meatninja@89-69-171-18.dynamic.chello.pl) (Quit: we'll meat again)
[12:41:23] <Cork> susi_: booklets can't remove entries from the history
[12:41:24] <MJCD> it categorically is not possible from within the page context (ie a bookmarklet) -- if it were any page could just put child porn in your history...
[12:41:28] <MJCD> etc
[12:41:56] <MJCD> just use incognito mode it's 2 clicks vs "nohistory" being many keystrokes
[12:42:00] <Cork> and the private tab is just the ui part, the rest is built in, the just choose to limit it to windows in the default ui
[12:42:45] <susi_> won't use incognito, it requires opening another browser window.. would be ok if there were private tabs
[12:43:57] <susi_> is there any good reasons for why not incognito tabs, internal design stuff or something?
[12:44:24] <Cork> they didn't want to complicate the ui for users
[12:44:39] <susi_> and yea, I didn't suggest booklet to edit history, but block entry from going into history
[12:44:41] <Cork> as private tab is seen as an advanced user feature
[12:44:50] <susi_> lol..
[12:44:54] <Cork> susi_: that is the same thing
[12:45:13] <Cork> as what you load goes into history, only way "to block it" is to remove it afterward
[12:45:54] <susi_> yes, I got it, but I did not know it initially for sure
[12:45:54] <Cork> susi_: they choose to implement it so it was possible, though just not the target for the main ui
[12:46:16] <Cork> extensions for custom ui is really what extensions are meant for, so not sure why you are so annoyed about that
[12:47:09] *** Quits: gitly (~gitly@148.252.133.169) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[12:47:21] <susi_> containers are already there, could be incognito containers as well
[12:47:34] <Cork> containers is there on the same level as private tab
[12:47:44] <Cork> the ui is missing unless you install an extension
[12:48:11] <susi_> I right mouse-click to get the dropdown menu, where it is accessible without any extensions
[12:48:22] <susi_> and incognito container could be there just as well as those other default containers
[12:48:38] <Cork> ah, right they did add the context menu for containers
[12:48:45] <Cork> for got about that
[12:48:57] *** Joins: gitly (~gitly@148.252.133.202)
[12:49:06] <Cork> anyway the default ui won't work for everyone, it will always be the fact
[12:49:30] <Cork> they choose what is there now as the target, and don't do "change how the ui works" as options now days
[12:49:39] <Cork> so that is moved to extensions
[12:49:53] *** Joins: uid_max (~samw@host165-120-31-142.range165-120.btcentralplus.com)
[12:50:42] <MJCD> it's just not at all any kind of realistic issue lol
[12:50:45] <susi_> I understand what you mean, it's just that this one wouldn't need any changes anywhere... just adding "Private/Incognito" in addition to Personal/Working/Banking/Shopping
[12:51:22] <MJCD> all so nobody knows that susi had to google how many cm an inch was
[12:51:30] <MJCD> and is for some reason ashamed that someone might find out
[12:51:33] <Cork> susi_: yes it would cause they don't want to have to explain to ppl what privaty tab is, and why two tabs in the same window behaves differently
[12:51:43] <MJCD> and clicking twice is too much effort
[12:51:45] <MJCD> :(((
[12:51:46] <Cork> the cost is in support and documentation/translations
[12:52:04] <susi_> I dont remember how much an inch is, something ~2,5 cm iirc, who cares
[12:52:04] <MJCD> the "cost" is just not catering to every freaking whim someone wants
[12:52:05] <MJCD> lol
[12:52:09] <Cork> and somewhat in code translation, but that is much smaller
[12:52:13] <susi_> but how are inches and centimeters related to this?
[12:52:19] <susi_> (or any units of measure)
[12:52:33] <MJCD> you're dense as.
[12:52:35] *** Parts: MJCD (uid193337@user/mjcd) ()
[12:52:58] <susi_> and what issue isn't realistic?
[12:53:07] <susi_> what are you talking about?
[12:53:11] <Cork> he left
[12:53:23] <Cork> and i'm not really sure what he got upset about to be honest
[12:53:56] *** Quits: gitly (~gitly@148.252.133.202) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[12:53:56] <Cork> but mozilla has a design group, they choose what the ui should target based on research (experiments in the browser and so on)
[12:54:37] <Cork> and they saw that explaining for novice users that barly understand what a tab is that tab b is not of the same type as tab a or c is a night mare
[12:54:43] <Cork> and i understand where they are comming from
[12:55:00] <Cork> so they choose to go "window only, but make it easy to do with an extension"
[12:55:03] <Cork> and that is what we got
[12:55:15] *** Joins: gitly (~gitly@185.69.145.65)
[12:56:07] <Cyp> Inch = 2.54 cm
[12:56:07] <Cork> firefox support something like 100+ languages, so translation of documentation and ui is a MUCH higher cost then most user think about
[12:56:07] *** Quits: frytaped (~frytaped@user/go4godvin) (Quit: frytaped)
[12:56:42] <Cork> and is actually one of the driving factors why they are removing options in the options page
[12:56:44] <susi_> https://0x0.st/ooit.png this is what I mean
[12:56:59] <Cork> yes, that is containers
[12:57:12] <Cork> containers behave exactly the same as normal tabs execept cookies are isolated
[12:57:21] <Cork> so it behaves more like ppl expect
[12:57:33] <Cork> while private tabs just go poof when you close them
[12:57:35] <susi_> yeah, there could be some work with documentation or whatever, maybe, but nothing remarkable... and wouldn't require any changes to UI, wouldn't add complexity (why container called "Incognito" is more complex than "Shopping")... I think "Personal" is even misleading
[12:57:48] <susi_> one could suggest that "Personal" is private
[12:57:57] <Cork> cause containers isn't even close to private tab
[12:58:12] <susi_> but yeah, it's not there, fine, just that it could be without any mere extra work
[12:58:17] <Cork> private tabs: doesn't use local cache, doesn't write AHYTHING to disk
[12:58:37] <Cork> containers separate the cookie and localstore so you have have multiple logins for the same domain at the same time
[12:58:42] <susi_> yes, but if a tab could be private, I'm pretty sure a container could be private as well, or tabs inside a container
[12:58:47] <Cork> so at worst you have to log into a domain twice
[12:59:10] <Cork> containers can't be private tabs and still be containers no
[12:59:17] <Cork> as private tabs has no history at all
[12:59:53] <susi_> then this "Incognito" container could be an exception, or there could just be a "Open a new private tab" under dropdown menu
[12:59:58] <Cork> also the behaviour of opening a link in a new tab from a private tab is mirky
[13:00:06] *** Quits: gitly (~gitly@185.69.145.65) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[13:00:34] <Cork> susi_: sure, it could but they found it to be less breaking and easier to explain then the behaviour of private tab
[13:00:34] <susi_> "Open a new private tab" would be what I really want, not private containers
[13:00:44] <Cork> yes so install the private tab extension
[13:00:48] <Cork> and you will get the ui
[13:00:51] <susi_> yep yep, ill go to eat
[13:01:25] <susi_> Mozilla makes super-idiotic design choices particularly concerning UI
[13:01:47] *** Joins: gitly (~gitly@148.252.129.23)
[13:01:55] <Cork> they don't design the browser to work perfectly for a neach use case
[13:02:11] <Cork> it has always been the case, and mozilla is actually among the better about it
[13:02:20] <Cork> most other just "adapt, this is how it works"
[13:03:51] <Cork> also just to make this super clear, many of my use cases is what i consider neach use cases too, and i load extensions for those too
