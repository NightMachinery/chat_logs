[02:36:42] <shbot> emanuele6: declare -- filters=" --filter='foo bar' --filter='baz' --filter='weird\"file'"
[02:36:45] <geirha> shebang is wrong. sh does not have arrays
[02:36:45] <Bayes> hmm lemme think about that for a second
[02:37:11] <emanuele6> arrays are bash, not POSIX sh
[02:37:12] <Bayes> ah bash does
[02:37:24] <Bayes> that's why shellcheck was warning me about posix not having arrays
[02:37:28] <geirha> also, set -x is your friend
[02:37:28] <emanuele6> the backslashes are unnecessary.
[02:37:30] <geirha> !-x
[02:37:30] <greybot> set -x (or ''bash -x myscript'') makes bash output the exact command that it will run after parsing and expansion. You can put ''set -x'' just before the code you want to debug (turn off with ''set +x''). To add more information, change PS4 first: eg. PS4='+($?) $BASH_SOURCE:$FUNCNAME:$LINENO:'

[02:41:52] <emanuele6> bash is doing the right thing
[02:42:27] <Bayes> yeah I need literal " around the expression
[02:42:39] <emanuele6> no, you don't
[02:43:31] <Bayes> well I need to call something like this CW--filter=': /.rsync-filter' as per the rsync manual
[02:44:01] <emanuele6> you need a valid rsync filter, not quotes
[02:44:51] <emanuele6> i don't use rsync, but from the manual, i can tell that filter expects a command and then a file name
[02:45:05] <emanuele6> e.g. `- something' to exclude something
[02:45:24] <emanuele6> and you just have `--filter=something' which is not a valid rsync filter.
[02:45:28] <Bayes> yeah but that need be wrapped on single quotes
[02:45:49] <emanuele6> i really doubt that
[02:46:28] <Bayes> it does
[02:46:52] <Bayes> " If the filter contains whitespace, be sure to quote it "
[02:47:31] <emanuele6> i can only say that rsync '--filter=- a' does not give me a syntax error

[02:48:30] <emanuele6> and for  rsync '--filter=- a b'  i don't get any syntax error
[02:48:43] <emanuele6> you are not understanding how rsync filters works
[02:48:54] <Bayes> this works for me: rsync . --filter='- a b'
[02:49:13] <emanuele6> Bayes: and where are the quotes there?
[02:49:22] <emanuele6> you have not put any literal quotes there
[02:49:25] <Bayes> the single quotes around - a b
[02:49:46] <emanuele6> that only groups the spaces
[02:49:50] <emanuele6> it does not pass quotes
[02:49:57] <Bayes> that's what I want to do
[02:50:10] <emanuele6> it is the same as:  rsync . --filter=-\ a\ b
[02:50:22] <Bayes> yeah well that's what I want to do
[02:50:30] <emanuele6> or  rsync . "-"'-'\f\i\l\t"'''er'=- a b"

[03:01:06] *** Joins: fuzzybear3965 (~fuzzybear@185.38.217.76)
[03:01:23] <fuzzybear3965> I have an array of URLs that I'm downloading in parallel with xargs.

[03:01:41] <fuzzybear3965> I also have an associative array: hashes
[03:01:53] <Bayes> tirnanog well it's just that it doesn't seem to work, or at least set -x prints differently
[03:02:07] <fuzzybear3965> The URL from the array urls is supposed to be the key for the hashes associative array.
[03:02:27] <fuzzybear3965> Try as I might, I can't get the hashes[{}] value to pass the proper value into fetch_url
[03:02:33] <fuzzybear3965> It's always empty.
[03:02:52] <fuzzybear3965> I've printed hashes and I can see that the keys and values _should_ work given this array.
[03:02:53] <Bayes> but ok I'll give this another spin and see how it goes
[03:03:01] <emanuele6> yes, xargs is not bash and xargs launches a whole new bash process and you are injecting code.

[03:04:37] <tirnanog> they aren't, by the time rsync gets to it, owing to the quote removal stage.
[03:04:44] <tirnanog> this is also expected and normal.
[03:05:53] <Bayes> okay one last question?
[03:05:56] <Blondie101010> the quotes there allow you to distinguish the parameter separation
[03:06:22] <Bayes> when using "${exclude[@]/#/--filter=- }", what is it exactly that adds the extra single quotes in '--filter=- *.something' ?
[03:06:30] <tirnanog> # args=(foo); printf '<%s> ' '--exclude=foo' --exclude='foo' "${args[@]/#/--exclude=}" --exclude=foo \-\-\e\x\c\l\u\d\e\=\f\o\o
[03:06:31] <Bayes> is that the outer double quotes?
[03:06:31] <shbot> tirnanog: <--exclude=foo> <--exclude=foo> <--exclude=foo> <--exclude=foo> <--exclude=foo>
[03:06:34] <tirnanog> spot the difference.
[03:06:35] <emanuele6> it doesn't add any single quotes.
[03:06:40] <e36freak> Bayes: nothing is "adding quotes"
[03:06:41] <emanuele6> it just passes the strings
[03:06:50] <e36freak> Bayes: here, read these, it might help you understand what's going on
[03:06:52] <e36freak> !parser
[03:06:52] <greybot> The Bash Parser: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashParser -- Simplified Example: http://stuff.lhunath.com/parser.png
[03:07:15] <Bayes> okay thanks I'll check the parser guide
[03:08:02] <tirnanog> the only context in which single quotes are being 'added' is in the representation of the command by xtrace.
[03:08:26] <Bayes> yeah that's what was confusing me
[03:08:27] <tirnanog> the output is re-usable in that regard.
[03:08:46] <tirnanog> (without some form of quoting, the shell would otherwise split into two or more arguments)
[03:08:49] <Bayes> I get it
[03:08:49] <emanuele6> not quite, sometimes xtrace gets lazy and doesn't add quotes
[03:09:10] <e36freak> Bayes: quoting the "${exclude[@]}" expansion is what tells bash that each element of the expansion is its own argument
[03:09:16] <Blondie101010> word="unquoted" is different from word='"double quoted"'
[03:09:21] <e36freak> after that, no other quoting is parsed or required
[03:09:31] *** Quits: Kruppt (~Kruppt@50.111.24.186) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:09:58] <Bayes> also, should I quote expressions in arrays? like exclude=(*.txt $HOME/.autojump) vs exclude=("*.txt" "$HOME/.autojump")
[03:10:05] <emanuele6> unless rsync actually requires quotes in its filter syntax, but it does not and even if it did, it would not be the same quoting syntax as bash
[03:10:18] <emanuele6> Bayes: it depends on what you want to do
[03:10:38] <emanuele6> for $HOME/.autojump, you probably always want to quote it
[03:10:49] <e36freak> the items assigned to an array in a bulk manner, like that, undergo quote removal and wordsplitting the same way they do for any other command
[03:11:00] <e36freak> so you should quote them the same way you would for anywhere else you'd use them
[03:11:16] <Bayes> no that was my confusion, I thought I needed the quotes that bash needs when entered "by hand" sorry for the confusion but it makes sense now
[03:11:41] <Bayes> e36freak okay that makes sense
[03:11:45] <e36freak> Bayes: as long as the quotes are there when you do the array assignment, and you quote the array expansion, you're good to go
[03:11:53] <tirnanog> also *.txt would be be treated as a glob and potentially expanded by the shell, whcih might not be what you want when it comes to composing rsync filters in particular.
[03:11:54] <emanuele6> for *.txt, if you want to include all the names of the files that end with .txt in the current directory (file1.txt, file2.txt, etc), then use *.txt, if you want to add *.txt literally to the array, then use '*.txt' or "*.txt" or \*.txt or '*'.txt or "*".'t'\x't'""
[03:12:00] <e36freak> once bash parses that array assignment into multiple array elements, they stay that way, as long as you quote the expansion
[03:12:14] <Bayes> tirnanog correct I don't want the shell to expand *, I want a  "literal" star in there
[03:12:22] <emanuele6> then use '*.txt'
[03:12:27] <Bayes> gotcha
[03:12:41] <tirnanog> so, as above. you just need to ensure that - at the very least - the globbing character is quoted. many would just write '*.txt'.
[03:13:00] <Bayes> any reason you suggest '*.txt' instead of "*.txt" (even tho I'm not referencing any var inside anyway)
[03:13:01] <tirnanog> that impedes pathname expansion as the * is, thus, no longer special.

[03:14:09] <emanuele6> it's fine if you use "*.txt", it is also fine if you use \*\.\t"xt""", whatever
[03:14:16] <e36freak> Bayes: the fact that arrays do that is the whole point of having/using arrays over strings

[03:21:14] <greybot> basename(1) can strip the directory and extension from a path (dir/subdir/file.ext -> file.ext or file). A parameter expansion can do it cleaner and *much* faster: "${path##*/}", "${path%.*}", at the cost of missing edge cases like path=/ or path=/path/to/dir/

[03:22:16] <fuzzybear3965> I think Blondie101010 has the best idea which is to build the list that I actually want to use, first. The problem is that every item in the list should have 2 strings in it (for the two arguments to fetch_url).

[03:26:05] <fuzzybear3965> Hmmmm
[03:26:23] <tirnanog> using wait -n is simpler, where available.
[03:26:53] <fuzzybear3965> I have access to wait -n

[03:27:11] <fuzzybear3965> emanuele6 The tough part is combining the array looping with parallel.
[03:27:12] <emanuele6> !wait-n > then this
[03:27:12] <greybot> then this: Run up to 5 processes in parallel (bash 4.3): i=0 j=5; for elem in "${array[@]}"; do (( i++ < j )) || wait -n; my_job "$elem" & done; wait
[03:27:16] <fuzzybear3965> That's what xargs does nicely for me.
[03:27:23] <tirnanog> it's not tough at all.
[03:27:54] <emanuele6> i=0 j=5; for url in "${!hashes[@]}"; do (( i++ < j )) || wait -n; fetch_url "$url" "${hashes[$url]}" & done; wait
[03:27:57] <emanuele6> really not hard at all
[03:29:41] <fuzzybear3965> Wow.
[03:31:04] <Blondie101010> what's the '-n'?
[03:31:06] <emanuele6> well, that factoid is not the most efficient parallelisation, it runs five at first, and then the rest one by one after at least one of the initial five stopped
[03:31:07] <fuzzybear3965> Thanks a lot, everyone.

[14:47:24] <stevenm_> Lo, in other regex's I can say (?!$) to mean the next char should exist (i.e. not the end of the string) but *without* actually matching that char.  what would be the equiv of this in a bash if statement using =~  ?

[14:48:30] <tirnanog> stevenm_: zero-width assertions are not supported by the extended regular expression dialect.
[14:49:04] <stevenm_> so when using if in bash with =~ it's ERE then ?
[14:49:25] <stevenm_> that's odd because grep using -E it works

[14:53:06] <stevenm_> tirnanog, an IP

[14:54:43] <stevenm_> except bash doesn't like the (?!$) bit
[14:55:01] <stevenm_> but without it... something like 0.0.0.0. would match
[14:56:38] <tirnanog> ok, yes. that's a zero-width assertion. no, it does not work with grep -E. not even with GNU grep.

[17:16:49] <Coco92> is it always "$variable" and not ${variable}?
[17:17:12] <Soliton> !${
[17:17:12] <greybot> Without curly braces parameter expansions refer to the longest valid variable name or shortest positional parameter. "${var}bar" expands the parameter named "var" while "$varbar" expands "varbar". "$123" references argv[1] and "${123}" references argv[123]. Braces are requried for parameters > 9, special PEs, and array expansions: ${10}, ${var##pat}, ${arr[5]}. BRACES AREN'T A SUBSTITUTE FOR QUOTES!
[17:17:30] <Soliton> you can use ${variable} but you need to quote either way.
[17:18:25] <Coco92> i am a really beginner, but does this means that ${ expands the variable to the addition in a quote?

[18:14:11] <rinzewind> $1 and $2 are not doing anything, yes.
[18:14:24] <rinzewind> I don't want the python script to read stdin. It uses argparse and it expects 2 arguments.
[18:14:58] <earnestly> The point isn't to read stdin per-se, the point is to avoid re-executing python for every input.  This is typically done by implementing it as a filter

[18:15:55] <rinzewind> geirha: Because for some reason when I do that a lot of entries are skipped. tirnanog suggested that this is because the script is consuming stdin.
[18:16:01] <tirnanog> earnestly's point is valid one, also. it would be more efficient to shift the burden of processing the input to the script itself.
[18:16:11] <geirha> rinzewind: aha, so your python script is reading stdin then?

[18:32:07] <rinzewind> So there's something funkier in the original script, but the input is treated in the same way.

[18:39:46] <YoungFrog> if I type "cat <<EOF" then "foo#bar" then "EOF", I obviously see "foo#bar" printed and that's good ; but the _history_ has a spurious newline : hitting <up arrow> shows a blank line in addition to the "foo#bar" line. Is this known ? I don't know how to google it.

[18:43:34] <tirnanog> or did I. are you saying that there's a spurious blank line, YoungFrog?

[23:53:27] <deadmund> Maybe if [[ "$result" == "$soln" ]]   is better?
[23:53:42] <phy1729> if you're not targeting POSIX sh, yes use [[
[23:53:47] <deadmund> Lots of web sites seem to conflict on the best practice.  https://www.log2base2.com/shell-script-examples/string/shell-script-to-compare-two-strings.html

[23:53:52] <sixwheeledbeast> is it suppose to be bash?
[23:53:59] <deadmund> Yes a bash script
[23:54:02] <deadmund> This is #bash right?
[23:54:09] <phy1729> We handle sh too
[23:54:29] <phy1729> If you're targeting POSIX sh, [[ doesn't exist, so you have to use [. If you're using bash, just use [[.
[23:54:46] <sixwheeledbeast> well there's no shebang and your using test not [[ so it's a reasonable question...

[23:55:02] <deadmund> Ahh
[23:55:54] <deadmund> I find that if I use if [[ "$result" == "$soln" ]];  and hard-code result="abc" and soln="abc" just before it works.  But if I use the result from my python3 program it does not seem to be equal?  I'm not sure why?  Some sort of hidden \n or something somewhere?
[23:56:17] <Soliton> maybe. perhaps check.
[23:56:31] <phy1729> or some of the spaces are tabs or other hidden characters
[23:57:22] <deadmund> Is there someway I can get bash to show me the string with all of the hidden characters (for example, show me \n instead of a literal break to the next line) ??
[23:57:55] <phy1729> typeset -p variable_name_here
[23:57:59] <Soliton> you can use  printf %q\\n "$string"  for example.
[23:57:59] <tirnanog> printf %q "$var"
[23:58:06] <tirnanog> or '%q\n', right.
[23:58:17] <phy1729> er it'd idiomatically declare -p in bash isn't it
[23:58:35] <tirnanog> yes, but it's not as useful as %q for this purpose.
[23:59:02] <tirnanog> # var=$'\n'; declare -p va
[23:59:03] <shbot> tirnanog: bash: declare: va: not found
[23:59:04] <tirnanog> # var=$'\n'; declare -p var
