[06:41:19] <ramram[m]> guys share some good zathurarc colors for eyes
[06:56:29] <telegram_1372692> > <Neo Void> Ik its stupid question:
[06:56:29] <telegram_1372692> > Hello Do I really have to put two computers into a same network for being able to login into my friends pc.
[06:56:29] <telegram_1372692> > through ssh?
[06:56:29] <telegram_1372692> It's complicated. Unless you do port forwarding to make it discoverable if the PCs are in different network. Also most ISPs in my experience do not open such ports and use a non static IP address.
[07:16:36] <MohdAariz[m]> <ramram[m]> "guys share some good zathurarc..." <- Bro use foliate

[10:01:08] <NotAStraightShoo> Umm, small question: if Matrix is federated and other people can have their own servers that also store the data, then what stops them from accessing your messages on the channel even after a request for deleting the data? 
[10:01:31] <NotAStraightShoo> s/store/stores/
[10:02:31] <Tor[m]> NotAStraightShoo: Nothing 
[10:02:41] <NotAStraightShoo> NotAStraightShoo: Example: If i delete this, but someone, say arya (just for example) has the data stored on his server too, then is there no way for me to ensure that it gets deleted? 
[10:03:04] <NotAStraightShoo> Tor[m]: Seriously? What about GDPR's Right to be Forgotten? 
[10:03:15] <Tor[m]> Iirc gtlsgamr said even if you delete msg you can sed it in irc
[10:04:15] <Tor[m]> NotAStraightShoo: It's private server and depends on the location of server too 
[10:04:26] <NotAStraightShoo> Tor[m]: Whooo, that's kinda scary... This is the nightmare version of "tweets from a decade ago ruin your life" 
[10:04:41] <Tor[m]> NotAStraightShoo: I don't think so but yes 
[10:05:12] <Tor[m]> What do you think the phrase everything happens on internet stays on internet mean ?
[10:05:48] <NotAStraightShoo> Tor[m]: Yea, that's there too...
[10:05:48] <NotAStraightShoo> Anyways, thanks for clearing stuff up :)
[10:06:24] <Tor[m]> > <@saharsh.bhansali15:matrix.org> Yea, that's there too...
[10:06:24] <Tor[m]> > Anyways, thanks for clearing stuff up :)
[10:06:24] <Tor[m]> I see what you did there ;')
[10:07:02] <NotAStraightShoo> Guess imma switch to matrix+irc as far as possible...
[10:07:02] <NotAStraightShoo> Though, i can't decide on which IRC client to use for Android :(
[10:07:11] <NotAStraightShoo> Tor[m]: Hehe
[10:07:38] <Tor[m]> > <@saharsh.bhansali15:matrix.org> Guess imma switch to matrix+irc as far as possible...
[10:07:38] <Tor[m]> > Though, i can't decide on which IRC client to use for Android :(
[10:07:39] <Tor[m]> I don't know haven't used irc yet :( 
[10:09:25] <Tor[m]> Which client you use for matrix ?
[10:09:38] <NotAStraightShoo> Tor[m]: Element, for now
[10:10:29] <NotAStraightShoo> Just started using it, so I'm gonna try to get used to using bridges for tg, discord and other apps
[10:13:20] <NeoVoid[m]> > <@saharsh.bhansali15:matrix.org> Guess imma switch to matrix+irc as far as possible...

[12:58:27] <ramram[m]> is there any work around to open these sites
[13:25:06] <MohdAariz[m]> Alo guys
[13:25:11] <MohdAariz[m]> i am thinking of getting a phone
[13:25:20] <MohdAariz[m]> which one should i get
[13:25:34] <MohdAariz[m]> it has to be one under 20k or 20k
[13:29:19] <klimi[m]> i have xiomi mi a1 and it's awesome phone
[13:30:15] <MohdAariz[m]> i will look into that
[13:32:05] <MohdAariz[m]> i was thinking redmi note 8 or 8t with arrow os

[16:05:23] <Zbnssn[m]> yeah mi phones are good for unlocking oem bootloaders and then installing a custom privacy oriented os
[16:06:08] <Zbnssn[m]> I tried to completely degoogle my phone but now after alot of hassle with running micro-g I use flame-gapps
[16:06:08] <Zbnssn[m]> for apps that depend on google play services
[16:07:01] <Zbnssn[m]> Android is Open Source you can use Graphene OS/Calyx OS/Lineage OS for a foss phone
[16:07:03] <Zbnssn[m]> But ot
[16:07:25] <Zbnssn[m]> But it's fucking inoperable because of Google
[16:07:45] <Govindas[m]> graphene only works on pixels
[16:07:57] <Zbnssn[m]> yeah most only do on pixels
[16:08:06] <Govindas[m]> it's pretty operable if you use f-droid
[16:08:23] <Zbnssn[m]> That's why you should buy like a OnePlus phone
[16:08:26] <Govindas[m]> just if you're new to f-droid, it can take a while to find replacement for every gplay app
[16:08:30] <Zbnssn[m]> in my case Mi works fine
[16:08:53] <Zbnssn[m]> you want to install that one app? sideload the apk from from site or Aurora Store
[16:08:53] <Zbnssn[m]> BAM it shows error message that it requires Google Play Services
[16:09:15] <Govindas[m]> if app isn't on fdroid, I don't use it
[16:09:54] <Zbnssn[m]> Govindas[m]: replacement is one thing, I know there are plenty apps that can replace whatsapp
[16:09:54] <Zbnssn[m]> but replacing it I wouldnt be able to get message for my college/family/friends etc. who are on that said app
[16:10:39] <Govindas[m]> just explain privacy concerns to them and tell that it is the only way to contact you, then you'll find who are the real friends
[16:12:17] <Zbnssn[m]> I could see myself there in like 5 years when I'm a self-sustaining adult but rn as a college student I just really can't
[16:12:50] <Hello[m]> Hey do you use banking apps on custom rom because that's only thing unclear for me to use custom rom?
[16:13:06] <Govindas[m]> I've never used a banking app, the bank has a website
[16:13:19] <E-man[m]> Govindas[m]: Nah thats not feasible. Best bet is to use two devices and containerize how much ever possible.
[16:13:25] <Zbnssn[m]> yeah you can use banking apps, but the apps won't work because they detect if you have a rooted phone
[16:13:49] <Hello[m]> Zbnssn[m]: If we don't root it...
[16:13:52] <E-man[m]> Zbnssn[m]: Works well with magisk hide. Using a rooted phone currently.
[16:14:03] <Zbnssn[m]> because a rooted phone has higher elevated privileges if someone hacks your phone then yk they don't want to liable for it
[16:14:09] <Zbnssn[m]> so use magisk hide
[16:14:55] <E-man[m]> Zbnssn[m]: Yep that is true. I have 2fa with the tokens being generated on my laptop for most cases.
[16:15:01] <Govindas[m]> E-man[m]: it won't end if you keep submitting to tyranny
[16:15:20] <Zbnssn[m]> magisk is systemless root you can turn it on and off instead of earlier suroot or kingroot methods which like would find vulnerabilities in your system and you'd like change your system files... v dangerous could possibly even brick your phone
[16:15:53] <E-man[m]> Zbnssn[m]: Yep. I stopped using suroot shortly after magisk came.
[16:16:54] <E-man[m]> Govindas[m]: You cannot educate the majority of the people. They will be worried for one day and forget it the next day itself. "I have nothing to hide" - classic. The systems have to change.
[16:17:11] <Zbnssn[m]> I got into android rooting and stuff right after getting into linux and damn the filesystems and most stuff is literally just like linux wow felt so cool all android run on linux kernel
[16:18:18] <Zbnssn[m]> E-man[m]: yeah and if you are concerned for privacy they'd point to you are a terrorist? are you a pedophile who's got stuff to hide??
[16:18:19] <Zbnssn[m]> Everyone has skeletons in their closet
[16:18:49] <Zbnssn[m]> really love the Snowden quote
[16:18:50] <Zbnssn[m]> Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.
[16:18:50] <Zbnssn[m]> Edward Snowden
[16:18:56] <E-man[m]> E-man[m]: Also man normally people who are not in security, many people really do overestimate their risk analysis. Not everyone needs a+ security. You need to do a audit of your requirements. A normal layman would not have the same risks as an investigative journalist.
[16:19:17] <Zbnssn[m]> true you need to have like a threat model
[16:19:38] <Zbnssn[m]> don't need a super complicated password for a site you'd be visiting 1-2 times
[16:20:37] <Zbnssn[m]> if this site's database got leaked and you use the same 16char long special characters super complicated passphrase everywhere you're not really secure
[16:21:18] <E-man[m]> Yes many people miss this and security is hard man. Especially today. Use ad blocker, use a system 76 laptop, use Firefox with script blockers and you stick out like a sour thumb. Fingerprinting is a huge headache. You can be hardware fingerprinted if your configuration is too unique with a performance profile.
[16:24:41] <E-man[m]> Someone using a Mac, with chromium, using gmail, would look lof less conspicuous. Just encrypt the content if you are worried of being snooped on. And people misjudge how incompetent people working in big companies can be. Not everyone who works there are super evil genius. The top brass too, at the end of the day cares just about bean counting and excel sheets. No one gets raw data, unless you are an active bad actor '.
