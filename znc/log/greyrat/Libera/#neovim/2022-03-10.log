[07:09:30] <dngray[m]> well room v9 fixes that one there:
[07:09:30] <dngray[m]> > Without the `join_authorised_via_users_server` property, redacted join events can become invalid when verifying the auth chain of a given event, thus creating a split-brain scenario where the user is able to speak from one server‚Äôs perspective but most others will continually reject their events.
[07:09:30] <dngray[m]> > This can theoretically be worked around with a rejoin to the room, being careful not to use the faulty events as `prev_events`, though instead it is encouraged to use v9 rooms over v8 rooms to outright avoid the situation.

[13:15:25] <kenaryn> only 1 of them*
[13:17:25] <kenaryn> For example, in a theme, there is both a variable hightline_linenumber in VimScript and in Lua. Do I have to add both of them in init.vim? Because it has no effect at all.

[13:19:14] <seandewar[m]> <kenaryn> "Does configuring a plug-in for..." <- usually only one, especially since lua config support has improved 
[13:19:53] <seandewar[m]> however if ur config is primarily vimscript, its more likely you'll need to mix vimscript and lua if the plugin you're configuring has some sort of lua setup function tho

[17:19:02] <BennyPowers[m]> hey there ffffffriends,
[17:19:02] <BennyPowers[m]> every time i source my config (which i've scripted to happen every time i save a file under `.config/nvim/**/*.lua`), I get a new instance of `lua-language-server` via sumneko_lua, via lsp-config. This causes a popup when formatting to choose between multiple instances of the same server, and also duplicates the loading status (Loading workspace...) 
[17:19:02] <BennyPowers[m]> What would you all recommend to prevent that?
[17:20:43] <clason[m]> Not to do that.
[17:23:42] <kenaryn> oktraits: thank you.

[18:51:41] <kenaryn> Add 'v:lua' only if you configure your lua-based plugin in vim.init. That's not necessary for lua.init.
[18:51:48] <ArshiaAghaei[m]> The require it from init.vim or init.lua

[23:25:54] <nabakolu> Hey, I just switched to neovim and wanted to start using some plugins, but all of the plugins that provide some fzf feature give the following error, when used: ' Key not present in Dictionary: "t" ' and ' E116: Invalid arguments for function toupper '.

[23:37:53] <kenaryn> Yes I did
[23:38:23] <kenaryn> I have now a serious doubt, does the file must be named 'vim.init' or 'init.vim'?
[23:38:51] <xiretza[m]> init.vim

[23:39:03] <xiretza[m]> or init.lua if you want to use lua instead of vimscript
[23:39:17] <kenaryn> Thanks, that explain why nothing works anymore.
[23:39:50] <kenaryn> in fact I have both, the second one being in a lua subdirectory, is it the correct way to do so?
[23:40:59] <xiretza[m]> you can have only either init.vim or init.lua in your main config directory, I'm not sure how the lua subdirectory is handled

[23:43:42] <kenaryn> I thought I needed to decouple in 2 files, replacing 'lua <<END <config> END' in init.vim with 'lua' (like 'lua require') in the second one.
[23:44:58] <xiretza[m]> `lua <<FOO ... FOO` is just a shorthand for lots of separate `lua` commands, which is how you invoke lua from vimscript
[23:45:08] <xiretza[m]> if you want to run lua from a lua file, you just write the code
[23:48:07] <kenaryn> Thank you :)

[23:49:21] <kenaryn> Then when a nvim plug-in doc tell a way to configure it with lua and vim, I only have to choose one of them but not both is that right?
[23:50:08] <xiretza[m]> correct
[23:52:21] <mjlbach[m]> Around 0.5 the default was "use init.vim" but with 0.7 and all of the lua first plugins the default is probably going to shift to init.lua IMO
[23:53:17] <xiretza[m]> you can always fall back to the other one using `lua` and `vim.cmd()` of course
