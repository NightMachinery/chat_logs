[00:16:28] <daemon> hey mst what is the channel founders nickname? I assume its not chainsaw-wielder :P
[00:16:38] <LeoNerd> Of this channel?
[00:16:40] <daemon> yes
[00:16:47] <LeoNerd> I believe the founder's name is "LeoNerd"
[00:16:47] <daemon> -ChanServ- 9        chainsaw-wielder       +AFRefiorstv         (FOUNDER) [modified 22w 5d 9h ago, on May 22 11:04:59 2021 +0000, by LeoNerd]
[00:16:49] <genio> Well that was good! Worked with a Jr dev this week on a feature a bit and in some weird scenarios the front-end portions of it failed to function. he figured out the answer today and felt confident enough to point it out as a "we're idiots" issue and we were both able to laugh about it and get things fixed (with tests)!
[00:16:53] <daemon> really you :o
[00:17:05] <LeoNerd> I happened to be around and most active at the time
[00:17:08] <daemon> ah
[00:17:12] <daemon> can I grab you in pm for a mo
[00:17:16] <LeoNerd> The migration from Freenode to here was rather sudden
[00:17:27] <LeoNerd> Uhsure?
[00:17:53] <daemon> err im not sending you a message in pm without permission. do not worry its not for raid shadow legends :)
[00:18:59] <lopid> sounds kinky
[00:19:18] <daemon> it could be, but unfortunatly not :(
[00:20:59] <Grinnz> daemon: chainsaw-wielder is mst
[00:21:19] <daemon> ah 
[00:21:26] <LeoNerd> Bah, curses to you, Test::Pod
[00:21:41] <LeoNerd> It complains about my use of the word "reüsed" without having declared an encoding
[00:22:04] <LeoNerd> Touché, my friend. Touché.
[00:22:06] <genio> haha. you do love you some umlauts 
[00:22:18] <LeoNerd> It's not an umlaut. It's a diaeresis
[00:22:27] <daemon> unlauts are pretty it looks like a little smiley face ü
[00:22:30] <LeoNerd> Actually in English it kinda has the *opposite* meaning than it does in German
[00:22:39] <LeoNerd> In German, the letter ü is a different letter to the letter u
[00:23:03] <El_Che> or rather a different sound?
[00:23:11] <LeoNerd> Whereas written in English, a diaeresis says that "honestly, this vowel really is the same boring normal vowel it ever was".. it kinda escapes it from having its dipthong meaning
[00:23:24] <LeoNerd> reuse is "(re)(use)"... it doesn't contain the eu sound
[00:23:26] <Grinnz> tbh there is no reason to write any pod without =encoding UTF-8 first
[00:23:34] <LeoNerd> Grinnz: well that too ;) I can add that
[00:23:47] <LeoNerd> reëncode <= (re)(encode), not an "ee" sound
[00:24:05] <genio> or, you know, can we just make it so all pod is now assumed utf-8 and narrow our eyes at non-utt8 pod?
[00:24:15] <LeoNerd> Ahh.. if only
[00:24:21] <Grinnz> genio: easier sell than for code at least
[00:24:25] <LeoNerd> Turns out there's a lot of non-ASCII files that don't declare their encoding
[00:25:14] <Grinnz> most of the breakage would probably be in things that ship the Test::Pod test isntead of making it an author test like they should
[00:25:14] <zgu> those files are so cliche¿Æ
[00:25:22] <Grinnz> which is unfortunately a lot
[00:25:45] <genio> then those shall get the narrowed eyes of suspicion and we move on?
[00:25:58] * genio lives in a perfect world in his head
[00:26:25] <Grinnz> if it was a perfect world we wouldn't need perl. or we'd always need perl. one of those
[00:27:02] <genio> yes
[00:27:02] <LeoNerd> Today's Freudian typo:  ./Build manfeast
[00:27:11] <genio> lol
[00:27:20] <zgu> in a perfect world we'd only need perl

[01:24:19] <kiwiroy> LeoNerd: I have more async code than Object::Pad.
[01:26:25] <LeoNerd> Ah, F:AA still needs updating to use the latest XS::Parse::Sublike before this will work

[15:12:51] <MDingas> hey, new user here. Why does installing with cpanm take so much longer when compared to Python's pip for example? Just curious
[15:13:21] <LeoNerd> cpanm runs all the unit tests for the modules it installs.. does pip do that?
[15:13:49] <LeoNerd> Perl authors and culture has quite a strong emphasis on lots of unit testing.. the bulk of the runtime is waiting on those tests
[15:15:16] <MDingas> interesting, didn't know
[15:16:03] *** jrayhawk_ is now known as jrayhawk
[15:17:16] <simcop2387> MDingas: along with the tests, python can use precompiled binaries in a lot of cases where perl can't (that's all due to compiler and internal differences)
[15:17:31] <simcop2387> well cpanm can't anyway.  system packages that already know the perl config can do it

[18:34:40] <genio> So, ```` some code here ``` some other code here ````     makes one block as you'd expect with three literal backticks in the code block
