[05:00:43] <plasticuproject> There's a modulus and exponent
[05:00:58] <plasticuproject> the modulus is the product of 2 primes
[05:01:08] <Hydragyrum> odd numbers are numbers that are not divisible by 2
[05:01:37] <Hydragyrum> 2 is the only even prime, and is never used in creating an RSA modulus because it's far too small to be considered

[06:38:36] <plasticuproject> sad on many levels
[06:39:39] * Hydragyrum wonders why people would pay to use a toilet when they could piss on the side of it
[06:39:45] <ajak> LOL
[06:40:14] <sebbu> the real issue
[06:40:25] <sebbu> is that with free toilet, some people are gonna be messy
[06:40:27] <sebbu> and don't clean up
[06:40:32] <sebbu> and clog it up
[06:40:38] <sebbu> and spread stuff everywhere
[06:40:43] <sebbu> which *someone* needs to clean
[06:40:50] <sebbu> and that someone usually gets paid
[06:41:32] <electr0n> so that is not going to happen with paid toilet? you're joking right.
[06:41:35] <sebbu> Hydragyrum, maybe they ate bad food at their noon meal, and are gonna shit liquid, and won't be able to keep it up until they go back home in the evening
[06:41:43] <sebbu> less
[06:41:48] <sebbu> not "not at all", but less
[06:41:49] *** kish is now known as kish`
[06:41:55] <sebbu> and the money are gonna go to that cleaning guy
[06:42:04] <electr0n> ok. probably valid, yes.
[06:42:30] <electr0n> a portion of it, if they could get away with beloe minimum wage, they would.
[06:42:37] <sebbu> anyway, when there's free toilet, it's part of your local taxes
[06:42:38] <sebbu> :D
[06:43:06] <sebbu> oh
[06:43:09] <Hydragyrum> not when there's a gas station one ;)
[06:43:16] <electr0n> ugh, i have 900 defunct processes that don't seem to ever get cleared. can't kill an already dead processes
[06:43:16] <sebbu> but they already get away with below minimum wage
[06:43:35] <Hydragyrum> sounds like their parents aren't reaping properly?
[06:44:04] <sebbu> 1) stage in enterprise for student can be not paid at all, or paid way less than minimum wage, and you'll do the same job, but mainly the boring/repetitive parts
[06:45:02] <sebbu> 2) sometimes, you won't find employment fulltime, so you'll have to accept a part-time contact, so you'll be at minimum wages hourly, but not at the full-time amount of hours per months, so total per month will be below
[06:45:38] <sebbu> and ofc, because there's schedule constraints, and the contact can't have any amount of weekly hours, you probably won't be able to cumulate two of them
[06:46:16] <Hash> You can't kill a zombie
[06:46:21] <Hash> But you can kill the zombie maker
[06:46:33] <Hash> That will kill all the zombies under it.
[06:46:37] <sebbu> 3) you can be at minimum wage, but they forces you to have a specific healthcare or insurance which is 3 to 5 times more expansive than another one, while being worse
[06:47:00] <Hash> SIGTERM to parent process id should get rid of the zombies
[06:47:30] <Hash> and with systemd now, init doesn't control everything so you don't have to kill PID 1 to kill zombies
[06:47:48] <sebbu> like, as unemployed you have a good healthcare at 30€/month that reimburse pro over 80% of the stuff, but with new job you'll have one at 120€ that reimburse 25% of the stuff
[06:48:19] <sebbu> and ofc, you lose the reductions for transports, housing, etc...
[06:48:36] <Hash> I wonder who inherits the zombie process if parent dies since init doesn't run. I have no idea about systemd I should learn.
[06:48:46] <sebbu> and you might need new equipement (security shoes, nice suit, etc...)
[06:48:59] <sebbu> init always run
[06:49:02] <sebbu> it's just called systemd now
[06:49:03] <sebbu> :D
[06:49:16] <sebbu> soon, linux distributions won't exists anymore
[06:49:23] <sebbu> package management will be part of systemd
[06:49:25] <sebbu> same as kernel
[06:49:52] <sebbu> there'll be only 2 linux distributions : systemd and emacs
[06:50:03] <Hash> question I have is so zombies still suck brain juice?
[06:50:21] <Hash> zombies consume ram (dead pid, but is the memory cleared)

[09:11:11] <NerdyGirl> :(
[09:11:15] <MadCamel> I've recently switched from zoneminder to shinobi. It's been stable for a month or so. Zoneminder was absolutely buletproof though so time will tell...
[09:11:24] <NerdyGirl> u say that
[09:11:30] <NerdyGirl> my zoneminder currently doesn't work
[09:11:41] <mats1> does it have alpr or facial recognition, MadCamel
[09:11:46] <NerdyGirl> idk how to restart it
[09:11:50] <MadCamel> mats1: not really no

[09:12:23] <MadCamel> it took a while to dial it in but my zoneminder install lasted through 10 years worth of live upgrades with very few problems
[09:13:06] <NerdyGirl> I can't even get it to owork right
[09:13:38] <MadCamel> my advice is to use something more modern. It's mature but it's also a hot mess.

[09:14:26] <NerdyGirl> maybe I should just stick SD cards in my cameras and let them handle it onboard

[09:15:08] <NerdyGirl> if only there was a way to just easily record all my cameras on a 7 week loop without any thinking or anything
[09:15:18] <NerdyGirl> o well
[09:15:21] <catbeard> rtsp isn't difficult, you could just ffmpeg it
[09:15:44] <catbeard> it's PTZ integration that's the trick

[09:16:16] <NerdyGirl> i don't even know what that means
[09:17:08] <catbeard> vlc has a nice motion detection and boxing plugin
[09:19:44] <NerdyGirl> ya, my zoneminder completely fucking shit itself
[09:19:51] <NerdyGirl> won't even stop/restart
[09:19:56] <NerdyGirl> preventing the system from rebooting
[09:20:08] <catbeard> disk prob full
[09:20:21] <NerdyGirl> I wonder if I'd have better luck if it wasn't installed on a virtual machine
[09:20:56] <ajak> virtual machines are just machines, luck isn't related
[09:21:04] <NerdyGirl> but
[09:21:23] <NerdyGirl> idk why my virtual machines underperform
[09:21:23] <ajak> what exactly is happening when you try to reboot other than zoneminder barfing on the floor or whatever?

[09:22:33] <NerdyGirl> yeah, I thinjk it's out of space
[09:22:38] <NerdyGirl> but it won't let me expand the disk
[09:22:56] <catbeard> gotta shut it down first maybe to resize the vm disk
[09:23:04] <NerdyGirl> won't let me resize it

[09:24:16] <catbeard> but anyway this isn't #zoneminder
[09:24:45] <NerdyGirl> so?
[09:24:46] <catbeard> that channel does exist though i don't know if there's anyone there active
[09:25:03] <NerdyGirl> Are you telling me to stop talking about security?
[09:25:14] <catbeard> there would probably be a better venue for zoneminder related questions
[09:25:25] <catbeard> no, because you're not talking about security, so i don't have to
[09:25:38] <NerdyGirl> listen dog
[09:25:49] <catbeard> nah
