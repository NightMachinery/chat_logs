[04:06:24] <Nanobot> Update on Russia's war against the rest of the world: they've pretty much established a land bridge to Crimea. Still haven't taken either Kyiv or Kharkiv. EU fighter jets to support Ukraine arriving any minute now. The Belarus government is still a bunch of dicks, which is why Putin wants to work with them so much, because he has no dick. Meanwhile, the Russian economy is completely ruined. Like, even more than normal.

[06:47:11] <davic> gut btw
[06:47:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Hmmm...
[06:47:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I think you're probably missing variables anyway. How would it know to search for a PICO_SDK_PATH variable?
[06:47:29] <davic> why would u run pico MootPoot 
[06:47:33] <davic> just use nano
[06:47:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> He's not running an editor.
[06:47:52] <MootPoot> because I put "export PICO_SDK_PATH="$HOME/git/pico-sdk"" in my .bashrc
[06:48:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Yeah but that'd imply you have the cmake file look for that variable.
[06:48:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Does your cmake file do that or source one that does?
[06:48:26] <MootPoot> uh
[06:48:29] <MootPoot> idk
[06:48:32] <davic> MootPoot: why u running linux
[06:48:35] <davic> just use freebsd
[06:48:44] <MootPoot> davic: I only run templeOS
[06:48:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> davic: It'll present the exact same issues as far as this goes.
[06:48:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: So yeah, the issue is part of your cmake & variable setup.
[06:49:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> s/variable/environment/
[06:49:36] <MootPoot> I dont follow the last part
[06:49:53] <MootPoot> so the issue is that cmake does not know where pico-sdk is
[06:49:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The guides you've refered to have been incomplete.
[06:50:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's what I suspect.
[06:50:01] <MootPoot> oh
[06:50:21] <davic> MootPoot: Aurora doesnt understand our shitty memejokes
[06:50:35] <MootPoot> he's to big brain for us
[06:50:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm mostly ignoring them.
[06:50:38] <davic> where is denza252 when I need him
[06:51:05] <MootPoot> so I dont really follow what the fix is
[06:51:25] <MootPoot> 1.) cmake does not know where PICO_SDK_PATH is
[06:51:37] <davic> MootPoot: have you tried turning it off and on again
[06:51:48] <MootPoot> 2.) I directed bashrc to create a alias for the path called PICO_SDK_PATH
[06:52:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Basically, some cmake file or script in the toolchain you're using is supposed to use that variable to find the rest of the tools it relies on to build.
[06:53:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The variable itself won't do anything if the components that should be using it are missing.
[06:53:16] <MootPoot> if I do echo $PICO_SDK_PATH is shows the right filepath
[06:53:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Indeed.
[06:53:28] <MootPoot> okay, so the problem is not the referencing
[06:53:34] <MootPoot> its the toolchain
[06:53:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Indeed. Now it's the part that should be dereferencing/evaluating the variable and isn't.

[06:57:44] <MootPoot> this is the part I hate the most about programming
[06:57:55] <matt|home> Aurora_v_kosmose : yeah that's why im curious if anyone has suggestions
[06:57:59] <MootPoot> when you spend more time fucking around with getting your toolchain working
[06:58:09] <MootPoot> rather then actually doing your task
[06:58:26] <matt|home> yeah MootPoot it helps a lot when you're familiar with debugging and with toolchain issues. i agree it's what tends to drive off most people
[06:59:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I don't think Ueno-san counts but... it does involve some crass humor?
[07:01:02] <MootPoot> well, time to go to something that ACTUALLY works

[07:01:15] <MootPoot> :3
[07:01:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: That's not going to help the fundamental issue.
[07:01:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You're not familiar with cmake & tooling dependent on it. You'll keep hitting that wall.
[07:02:11] * MootPoot shushes Aurora_v_kosmose

[13:20:41] <pokhu> quart? does that mean quest?
[13:20:46] <amigojapan> pokhu: with the choice of turning in any direction at any crossroads of a large map

[13:21:56] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: Oregon Grail
[13:22:03] <pokhu> oh no its fine it just looked kind of passable

[13:24:46] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: not oregon, I want a mysteryous fantasy world
[13:24:54] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: a who-dunnit prepper game with on-rails shooting action
[13:25:03] <amigojapan> darkwitch: the enemy of the witch?
[13:25:11] <pokhu> i remember imagining a game myself
[13:25:28] <pokhu> something like an ascii roguelike but i really wanted lots more classes 
[13:25:49] <pokhu> i think thast what i find most enjoyable in a game, the classes and abilities
[13:25:55] <darkwitch> amigojapan, I don't have any enemies, only confused and misinformed people
[13:26:25] <amigojapan> pokhu: actually I am thinking of making an ascii mockup, so I can show it to artists who may draw graphics
[13:26:48] <amigojapan> darkwitch:ouch, that is kind of you
[13:27:23] <pokhu> i think the game would be very different
[13:27:41] <pokhu> mainly the turn based part

[13:28:30] <amigojapan> pokhu: and they have even made a card game for it lol
[13:28:52] <pokhu> i guess it depends on all your gameplay things

[13:29:01] <pokhu> like how will combat be?
[13:29:29] <amigojapan> pokhu: ummm, I thikn if Iinclude combat, people will think it is an RPG
[13:29:47] <amigojapan> pokhu: oregon trail is a resource management game
[13:30:23] <pokhu> hmmmm
[13:30:46] <amigojapan> pokhu: like cat getting collera, or you loosing your tongue in a fire, in my game, you could loose things form a dragon attack
[13:31:09] <pokhu> that might work 
[13:31:17] <amigojapan> yup yup
[13:31:42] * darkwitch remembers the dragon poop
[13:31:49] <amigojapan> pokhu: I think I will change the idea of only one wagon, to a caravan of wagons

[13:32:08] <amigojapan> darkwitch:lol, I can put it in as a cameo

[13:32:46] <amigojapan> lol true pokhu
[13:32:52] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: "Your house elf has dysentery"
[13:33:05] <darkwitch> she actually found a sword in the dragon poop
[13:33:16] <amigojapan> lol DunceCotus
[13:33:43] <amigojapan> darkwitch: that is fun糞
[13:33:44] <darkwitch> likely from some poor adventurer that the dragon had eaten
[13:33:45] <DunceCotus> "Gandalf has been eaten by a bear."
[13:34:07] <amigojapan> lol DunceCotus
[13:34:32] <DunceCotus> basically just Oregon Trail but with fantasy characters/setting

[13:35:01] <amigojapan> lol darkwitch
[13:35:23] <darkwitch> how else am I supposed to read it?
[13:35:44] <amigojapan> darkwitch: that kanji can be read as "fun"

[13:37:16] <amigojapan> pokhu: I thikn I will make the caravan ebign chased by an army of the dead
[13:37:57] <pokhu> oregon trails too short though

[13:38:27] <darkwitch> is oregon too small?
[13:39:07] <amigojapan> pokhu: I guess the winter is a problem, in oregon trail, but an army of teh dead keeps you going, withought the problem of time ending
[13:39:33] <pokhu> since its a caravan you should be able to pick people up
[13:39:43] <amigojapan> darkwitch:the road from eats US to west US is too short accoring to pokhu
[13:39:52] <pokhu> it was in the game
[13:40:12] <darkwitch> make it a long trail around the world then
[13:40:14] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: Escape the Onslaught of Winter: Trail
[13:40:24] <amigojapan> pokhu: also I think there should be many places to buy resources
[13:40:41] <pokhu> yeah there should be some other events as well
[13:40:51] <pokhu> like other than hunting and buying
[13:41:02] <amigojapan> darkwitch:I think I will make it a map which you can go in many directions you choose in forks in teh road

[13:43:14] <pokhu> you could do something like express delivery using birds and air or something
[13:43:20] <pokhu> there was a second game??? DunceCotus
[13:43:25] <DunceCotus> pokhu: yeah
[13:43:27] <pokhu> do they go back
[13:43:30] <pokhu> to missouri??
[13:43:32] <DunceCotus> it even had spoken dialogue
[13:43:35] <DunceCotus> which was hilarious
[13:43:41] <amigojapan> DunceCotus:not sure what you mean by format
[13:43:48] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: genre?

[13:44:15] <amigojapan> ah gotcha DunceCotus

[13:45:28] <pokhu> yeah you could employ soldiers

[17:23:54] <Cryowolf> randomly a certain minimum distance from the starting point I assume

[17:31:42] <Cryowolf> sure if you've only got one horse for your wagon and the horse snaps its leg, you'd have to abandon the wagon

[17:35:07] <Cryowolf> there's usually plenty of food near the nest though, that's why they'd build one. Flying over a large area increases the danger for the dragon of being caught in another ones territory or not knowing the land and so on. They should probably act logically
[17:36:29] <Cryowolf> and if dragons hunted humans as a primary food. Humans would be hunting them down to kill them all to stop the threat
[17:36:41] <darkwitch> you talk as if a mere human would understand the ways of a dragon

[17:38:10] <darkwitch> yes, for your own world, not for amigojapan universe
[17:38:34] <Cryowolf> but it makes sense that if a creature hunts humans as a primary food source and is a constant threat for the humans, they would do everything they can to negate that threat so they don't die

[17:39:48] <amigojapan> Hey Omega037 
[17:40:05] <Cryowolf> I don't know what your story is
[17:40:31] <darkwitch> neither do I until I tell it
[17:40:38] <darkwitch> it's complicated
[17:41:10] <Cryowolf> I'm only talking about how we as humans react when we have a threat. Like something eating us
[17:41:13] <Cryowolf> we kill it
[17:42:04] <darkwitch> the dragon would eat the edible TV
[17:42:11] <Cryowolf> if dragon attacks on humans is common, we'd have hunted them down
[17:42:22] <darkwitch> humans are saved
[17:42:25] <Cryowolf> and if we can't and they're so extremely powerful. We'd become extinct
[17:42:33] <Omega037> I mean, dinosaurs existed for 100s of millions of years
[17:42:43] <darkwitch> then the game is over with a happy ending
[17:42:44] <Omega037> They were basically dragons
[17:43:01] <Cryowolf> Omega037, they existed in different periods in different variations going through different extinction events
[17:43:10] <Omega037> I think a dragon existing is less likely than a dinosaur still existing today
[17:43:11] <Cryowolf> and a lot of them were basically birds
[17:43:18] <Omega037> So unlikely
[17:43:31] <Cryowolf> we used to think the t-rex was reptilian all over but it's more likely it was like an overgrown chicken
[17:43:36] <Omega037> I think we all understand that when I say "Dinosaur", I don't mean proto-chickens

[17:44:08] <Omega037> ^ fact
[17:44:26] <Omega037> Also not dragons though
[17:45:10] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, well considering dragons are legendary creatures and most people think of them as that. Wyverns aren't really that legendary, they're more like smaller and less intelligent dragons :P
[17:45:32] <Cryowolf> while dragons tend to have intelligence greater than a human in legends and myth
[17:45:43] <Cryowolf> and a lot of fiction
[17:46:18] <darkwitch> were they really more like alligators with wings?
[17:46:42] <Cryowolf> you can always change that, but chances are it will be immersion breaking for people. Of course if you want to enter dragon territory for a short cut, then hiring dragon slayers makes sense
[17:47:21] <Cryowolf> I'm just expressing random thoughts I have though
[17:47:26] <Omega037> my understanding is that dragons are believed to be myths *because* of dinosaur bones
[17:47:29] <Cryowolf> they're not "rules"
[17:47:44] <Omega037> They would find them and see proof of massive beasts that no longer exist

[18:07:59] <Shinra> I messed up today, there was a mandatory online session that I missed cuz the info for it was buried in an old announcement from weeks ago and I just totally forgot
[18:08:27] <amigojapan> ouch Shinra, what happens now?
[18:09:04] <Shinra> I dunno, I emailed the tutor but no reply yet
[18:09:04] <amigojapan> Shinra: I recommend you use a calendar, I dont udenrstand hwo people survive withought a calendar
[18:09:10] <ButterNoodle> I got fired for that once

[18:09:37] <ButterNoodle> my manager was cock tho
[18:09:37] <Shinra> cuz normally when we have a session we get an announcement for it or it's on our timetable
[18:09:44] <Shinra> this time we didn't
[18:09:55] <Shinra> our timetable is blank for this week

[18:10:27] <Shinra> oh they know
[18:10:32] <amigojapan> ok
[18:10:39] <Shinra> but the info is there in an old message
[18:10:43] <Shinra> so I have no defence

[18:14:05] <Cryowolf> well you don't have to listen to anything I say ^^
[18:14:11] <Shinra> there should be a cooking game called The Oregano Trail
[18:14:34] <Cryowolf> though random events can be connected to something so it makes sense that it occurs there

[19:37:58] <ButterNoodle> u listen to glenn beck
[19:38:02] <pokhu> whos that guy
[19:38:03] <HubertFarnsworth> ButterNoodle: it seems like generalization but it's sadly the truth. At least from what I hear and read. Brutal Training, shit wages and corruption is so rooted that any decent person just couldn't work as cop. 
[19:38:04] <ButterNoodle> the real "great reset"
[19:38:06] <pokhu> is he interesting
[19:38:07] <Jigsy> [16:07:50] <pokhu> after fallout
[19:38:13] <Jigsy> Fallout last centuries...
[19:38:16] <pokhu> yeah
[19:38:17] <pokhu> and?
[19:38:21] <Jigsy> Nobody will be alive after that.
[19:38:26] <ButterNoodle> Jigsy: are they making a sequel to that fallout game?
[19:38:28] <pokhu> youre too close minded
[19:38:30] <pokhu> ok ok ok ok ok 
[19:38:31] <pokhu> think about it
[19:38:35] <pokhu> no humans survive
[19:38:38] <pokhu> fallout ends
[19:38:44] <pokhu> and some animals stlil survive
[19:38:45] <ButterNoodle> then catgirls
[19:38:48] <pokhu> and then they re evolve
[19:38:49] <pokhu> yeah 
[19:38:50] <ButterNoodle> ggez
[19:38:51] <pokhu> exactly
[19:38:52] <Jigsy> Animals won't survive either.
[19:38:55] <pokhu> nonon
[19:38:58] <pokhu> i mean like bottom of the ocean
[19:39:04] <Jigsy> ...

[19:39:16] * ButterNoodle kimochi's for the cold nuclear winter that lets him curl up with catgirls
[19:39:20] <pokhu> cockroaches survive nukes
[19:39:22] <pokhu> what are you talking about
[19:39:29] <pokhu> this is common knowledge you know

[19:41:22] <ButterNoodle> will everything smell like bacon or steak after the nuclear apocalypse?
[19:41:24] <HubertFarnsworth> the pattern was repeating a bit much, isn't it?
[19:41:39] <Jigsy> [16:09:20] <pokhu> cockroaches survive nukes
[19:41:41] <Jigsy> They don't.
[19:41:43] <ButterNoodle> it was a ez map.. even tho it was fast
[19:41:48] <Jigsy> There was an entire Mythbusters about this.
[19:41:56] <pokhu> bacteria survive nukes
[19:41:57] <pokhu> ok
[19:41:58] <ButterNoodle> yea cockroaches survive elevated radation..
[19:41:59] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah
[19:41:59] <pokhu> ok is that ok?
[19:42:01] <pokhu> yeah
[19:42:09] <pokhu> bacteria going to become plants and stuff
[19:42:10] <Nanobot> Cockroaches would likely survive a nuclear war, but so would lots of other bugs.
[19:42:18] <pokhu> thats what i was saying
[19:42:25] <ButterNoodle> and no living organism will survive ground zero
[19:42:27] <Nanobot> (as in, cockroaches probably wouldn't go extinct)
[19:42:32] <pokhu> thast what i meant
[19:42:34] <HubertFarnsworth> tardigrade can survive space
[19:42:36] <ButterNoodle> ic
[19:42:54] <pokhu> obviously i didnt mean if you drop a nuke right on top of a roach itd survive
[19:43:00] <HubertFarnsworth> I play now, later
[19:43:20] <HubertFarnsworth> you can join me in realm of the mad god
[19:43:21] <ButterNoodle> if ur talking post blast.. lots of stuff will survive outside the impact

[21:34:17] <RaderH2O> sure it doesn't matter but it adds a lot
[21:34:20] <pokhu> but otherwise it doesnt matter after like 3 episodes
[21:34:21] <pokhu> nonononon
[21:34:24] <pokhu> youre tricking yourself
[21:34:29] <pokhu> doesnt matter at all adds nothing

[21:37:32] <RaderH2O> Anime is helping me enjoy life
[21:37:37] <RaderH2O> and um
[21:37:43] <RaderH2O> gives me a bit of energy to keep going and stuff
[21:37:44] <Bco1981> helping him to cope with real life nonsense
[21:37:48] <pokhu> spending your youth indoors
[21:37:49] <pokhu> watching anime
[21:37:57] <pokhu> i dont understand
[21:38:15] <RaderH2O> well I'm not an otaku or something I'm just a normal dude who likes some animes

[21:40:52] <RaderH2O> But yea I'm obviously not gonna watch hundreds of anime stuff since I don't like a lot of them. Just particular ones
[21:41:11] <pokhu> yeah yeah i understand
[21:41:23] <pokhu> youre too good to watch what we watch
[21:41:30] <RaderH2O> um

[21:42:22] <pokhu> listen
[21:42:24] <pokhu> how about
[21:42:29] <RaderH2O> I respect anyone no matter what they watch or what they like so it doesn't matter if u've watched like 500 animes or someone watched like 100 or even none
[21:42:32] <pokhu> next time you sit down to watch a new episode
[21:42:34] <pokhu> just dont watch it
[21:42:36] <pokhu> and do nothing

[21:43:32] <RaderH2O> JesseDesu eh not really arguing imo
[21:43:33] <pokhu> should i repeat myself
[21:43:37] <RaderH2O> I mean

[21:44:30] <RaderH2O> oh ffs do you think I'm the type of guy to be like "OMG DEMON SLAYER BEST ANIME" or something
[21:44:33] <pokhu> and you sit there for about 30 minutes or so
[21:44:37] <pokhu> that is completely unrelated
[21:44:37] <Bco1981> pokhu: it's not easy watching anime while you run... and i don't advise to try it.

[23:56:33] <ezekielnoob> i could relate to gojo a lot too
[23:56:42] <ezekielnoob> tho i don't make their dress

[23:57:24] <JesseDesu> she's the little sister
[23:57:32] <ezekielnoob> yeah she's cool too
[23:57:45] <ezekielnoob> i wonder if she'll cosplay
[23:58:00] <JesseDesu> i doubt it
[23:58:10] <JesseDesu> she's already good at one thing so why push it
[23:58:11] <ezekielnoob> there's a friend that kinda looked like marin except the pink lenses
[23:58:15] <ezekielnoob> but had the same hair color
[23:58:16] <Shinra> I think she wants to but is too shy
[23:58:44] <JesseDesu> i was never into cosplay
[23:58:48] <JesseDesu> i just like to look
[23:59:06] <ezekielnoob> Shinra or maybe she just isn't interested of doing it
[23:59:16] <ezekielnoob> she just likes to take pics
[23:59:18] <Shinra> in the anime she looked conflicted
[23:59:31] <ezekielnoob> true
[23:59:32] <Shinra> like she wanted to but doesn't want to venture in to her sister's realm

[23:59:35] <ezekielnoob> i wish she would try
[23:59:46] <ezekielnoob> her sister seems cool with it
[23:59:51] <Shinra> she has a reason we have not yet discovered
[23:59:54] <JesseDesu> i dont want her to
[23:59:56] <Shinra> I think it's in her head though
