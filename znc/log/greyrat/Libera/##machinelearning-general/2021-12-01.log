[19:41:00] <hodapp> yes, but from what I remember it doesn't really explain this property of self-supervised pretraining
[19:51:46] *** Joins: akevinhuang (~thekevinh@user/thekevinhuang)
[20:07:26] <dostoyevsky2> hodapp: I never really understood the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning, because a lot of labels are implicit anyways... The human UX has a visual grammar that is implicitly present, otherwise we wouldn't be able to see things... and NNs can pick up on that, the same as with written text
[20:11:13] <hodapp> well, how human vision works is a remarkably poor model for how to effectively handle vision tasks within a computer
[20:13:23] <hodapp> but supervised/unsupervised is more about the goals one has, and often about the choice of label, which isn't exactly something you have when it's just implicit labels and these implicit labels may or may not correspond to anything relevant to the goals
[20:14:52] <hodapp> supervised learning involves an explicit label that is directly applicable to a loss function that is critical as an optimization target
[20:15:27] <hodapp> within neural nets, most "unsupervised" methods are still basically supervised but with some kind of label or target to get it to hopefully learn something relevant
[20:16:09] <hodapp> e.g. autoencoders are an unsupervised method, but they're implemented as a supervised task with a target of "reconstruct the input"
[20:17:39] <hodapp> but there are a whole lot of other unsupervised methods where labels - whether explicit or implicit - do not factor in at all, e.g. clustering, PCA, ICA
[20:19:34] <[itchyjunk]> unsupervised is where you let the NN do the clustering
[20:19:55] <hodapp> self-supervised is kind of both, and kind of neither: it uses unlabeled data, but it explicitly uses some kind of supervision that it somehow derives without labels
[20:20:00] <[itchyjunk]> if you watch le cunn's presentation, unsupervised learning on handwriting recog often generates 11 labels
[20:20:29] <[itchyjunk]> for digits*
[20:20:40] <dostoyevsky2> hodapp: self-referencial networks and how great they work seems to suggest that the labels are already there...  There is no unlabeled data, except random data
[20:20:42] <[itchyjunk]> supervised for digits always has 10, ofcourse
[20:21:08] <[itchyjunk]> "label" is just clustering
[20:21:22] <[itchyjunk]> like hodapp said above, random clustering might be useless
[20:21:33] <[itchyjunk]> what does 11 "labels" for digit mean?
[20:21:39] <[itchyjunk]> how do you use that in any sensible way?
[20:21:45] <hodapp> dostoyevsky2: if no constraints are put on what a 'label' means, then it can be anything or nothing and its presence is without any meaning
[20:21:57] <[itchyjunk]> this is why unsupervised learning has almost no practical application in its pure form
[20:23:39] <[itchyjunk]> Last i hear of unsupervised learning being used was that chinese company..
[20:23:40] <dostoyevsky2> hodapp: No, it suggests that there is a grammar, which can be deduced by correlation... So the data has an order, otherwise it would be random
[20:23:42] <[itchyjunk]> can't think of it now
[20:23:57] <[itchyjunk]> dostoyevsky2, that doesn't mean much
[20:24:08] <hodapp> dostoyevsky2: correlation doesn't imply a grammar, much less a meaningful grammar
[20:24:10] <[itchyjunk]> encrypted data looks as noise
[20:24:14] <[itchyjunk]> but there is data there
[20:24:26] <[itchyjunk]> noise and data isn't inherently different, just what information you can infer.
[20:24:35] <[itchyjunk]> if you can't infer anything, it's noise - encrypted text.
[20:24:54] <[itchyjunk]> if you can decypher it or work with it, it's not noise - plain text , homomorphic encryption etc.
[20:25:06] <dostoyevsky2> hodapp: So how do self-referential networks work if they can't use correlation.. because NNs are just layered dot products
[20:25:27] <hodapp> and indeed if you look at natural images and do something like PCA (an unsupervised learning technique), you find some dimensions very strongly present... and they are also almost completely meaningless for what is salient in a natural image
[20:25:52] <[itchyjunk]> unsupervised NN's work exactly like supervised ones in principle.
[20:25:57] <[itchyjunk]> They do generate labels.
[20:26:06] <[itchyjunk]> The labels just have no inherent meaning.
[20:26:27] <[itchyjunk]> the NN saw some pattern in the noise and you have no idea what it means.
[20:26:44] <[itchyjunk]> seeing jesus on a piece of toast doesn't mean much to someone who doesn't knwo what a jesus is
[20:26:53] <hodapp> if 'label' is interpreted extremely broadly, I guess. An autoencoder doesn't really produce labels - just an embedded representation
[20:26:59] <[itchyjunk]> but might mean a lot to someone who can assign information to that label
