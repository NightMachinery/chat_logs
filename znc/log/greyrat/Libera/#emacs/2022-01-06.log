[03:19:49] <fnstudio_> hi, if i press `C-<prior>' i see a `~' is printed in my buffer (working in --no-window-system mode); if i do the same in a terminal, i get `5~' (respectively `;5~' for `C-<next>')
[03:19:51] <lPresidenteE> I'm new to Emacs.  Why did no one tell me emacs was the best irc client?  lol
[03:20:48] <fnstudio_> i'd like to bind `C-<prior>' to a command but it won't work, i suspect because it's not being received by emacs as such
[03:20:55] <technomancy> lPresidenteE: oh, I figured it went without saying !
[03:21:16] <fnstudio_> but the terminal is passing it over as `5~', instead?

[13:30:28] <Hash> that's also peculiar

[14:22:14] <taeaad> * @marcelm That is totally not what I said, on these old Unix (tm) systems these codepaths you mention
[14:22:14] <taeaad>  were separate executables, the first utility I remember seeing that combined the three
[14:22:14] <taeaad>  functionalities was GNU grep, somewhere in the nineties. GNU grep also had a far superior regex
[14:22:14] <taeaad>  engine, compared to both the BSD and the SYSV derived commercial Unices of that time. The fact that
[14:22:17] <taeaad>  OP's grep seems unable to understand -F might indicate that he's confronted with one of these
[14:22:20] <taeaad>  dinosaurs, hence my suggestion to try fgrep - that's available in even very ancient Unices.

[14:24:19] <taeaad> So that brings me back to my question about the BSDs. Aren't most of them open?
[14:24:26] <kilobug> taeaad: BSD and GNU have different views on some topics, like copyleft/licenses, which make cooperation between the two on code-level somewhat difficult
[14:24:32] <thblt> taeaad: the BSD and GNU licences are incompatible.
[14:24:38] <taeaad> Which supports copyleft?
[14:25:33] <thblt> taeaad: you can relicence BSD to GPL, but not the other way around. There's been some drama recently because Linux devs used BSD or MIT code, relicencing it under GPL without releasing back their improvements under the original licence.
[14:25:33] <kilobug> taeaad: both look towards interoperability, it's possible to use many GNU tools on BSD systems and vice-versa, but since they have different licenses and a different philosophy behind them, it's complicated to mix code
[14:26:19] <taeaad> OK that makes sense.

[14:27:28] <taeaad> I understand copyleft as: You have to publish your alterations (er, _somewhere_ public).

[14:30:05] <kilobug> jfb4: Linux devs took some BSD-licensed code from BSD system, modified it, and included it into Linux under GPLv2 - and some BSD developpers are unhappy because they can't do use the modified code in their original system

[21:01:38] <corwin> M-q (by default) is `quoted-insert', which lets us insert things literally.  usually modes leave this binding alone.   TAB is rather different and usually has a specialized meaning based on the active major mode.  In prog-mode derived modes (e.g. perl-mode, emacs-lisp-mode, etc.) tab is usually bound to something like `reindent but it varies alot. In org TAB is used to show/hide the sub-tree when pressed with point on a section header
[21:01:38] <corwin> but otherwise it does stuff with indentation.
