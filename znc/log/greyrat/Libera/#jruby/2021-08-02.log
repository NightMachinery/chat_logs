[19:33:50] <basshelal[m]> Good morning ðŸ˜Š
[20:06:09] <headius> ooo might have green handle_interrupt today
[21:40:47] <headius> woot, green, and I think I have the last spec fixed
[21:42:38] <headius> grabbing some lunch while CI chews on it
[22:38:40] <headius> All green and all specs untagged
[23:43:37] <headius> TIL Kernel#p is uninterruptible on CRuby
[23:59:04] <headius> omg if you Thread.current.raise while this thread is inside handle_interrupt it is supposed to honor it
[23:59:14] <headius> why
