[20:02:03] <yotadude> Could someone point me to documentation regarding debugging SSLVPN connection in real time at the console? For example, FortiOS has diag debug application sslvpn -1 which allows me to see every action and get detailed info for troubleshooting client connection errors.
[20:15:31] <plaisthos> sslvpn is thrown around for all kind of vpns
[20:15:45] <plaisthos> unless it says OpenVPN it is probably not OpenVPN

[21:35:42] <rob0> yep.  For OpenVPN check openvpn documentation.

[21:36:14] <rob0> Community openvpn does not have a GUI.
[21:36:42] <rob0> (well, I guess the Windows client does, but that's client only.)
[21:41:25] <yotadude> Let me clarify: I use FortiOS. I know nothing about OpenVPN. I am trying to find OpenVPN documentation on debugging authentication problems from windows openvpn client to openvpn access server. I am struggling with the search terms to find correct syntax 
[21:41:38] <yotadude> Debug sslvpn, debug client connections? etc
[21:42:41] <rob0> oh.  For Access Server the forums are a better place.  Or, you can open a Support ticket, openvpn.net/support/ .
[21:43:08] <yotadude> Typically in CLI you can add a debug flag to the service/feature, have the user recreate the issue and watch the console spit out what is happening
[21:43:12] <rob0> and we have some pages on the web site which can help
[21:43:18] <yotadude> ty
[21:43:52] <rob0> I do work with AS support, but this channel is for community openvpn.
[21:44:22] <rob0> holler at me here if you post a thread in the forum
[21:44:39] <rob0> forums.openvpn.net of course

[21:59:03] <plaisthos> yotadude: I cannot find any indications that the VPN that Fortinet uses has anything to do with OpenVPN
[21:59:27] <plaisthos> it is probably their own stuff that uses SSL like OpenVPN uses SSL

[22:55:27] <mzar> rob0: are you also using FreeBSD ?
[22:57:05] <rob0> no.  I do have a Mac though, and eventually that might be usable for Mac OS.
[23:05:07] <mzar> IIRC someone is using Pfsense, it looks like they sponsored this 
[23:09:25] <Pippin_> yeah pfs wants to have it :)
[23:10:39] <mzar> it looks like the news of the day (at least for FreeBSD && OpenVPN users;)
