[00:01:50] <Cryowolf> I dont understand amazon reviews that talk about how great a product is and then give it 1 star. Or the opposite, those who bash the product and then give it five stars
[00:02:04] <Cryowolf> its like they misunderstand the most obvious thing
[00:03:41] <Nanobot> People who don't watch VTubers: "All the girls are just men in real life." People who watch Hololive: "All the men are just girls in real life."
[00:04:21] <MootPoot> Nanobot: vtubers have made me distrust voices 
[00:04:44] <Cryowolf> Yes Nanobot, Vtubers will one day rule the world
[00:04:45] <MootPoot> the amount of times I've heard a female VA pull off dude voices
[00:04:55] <Bco1981> that's anime
[00:05:04] <Bco1981> not many vtubers
[00:05:07] <Nanobot> If it helps: Voice changing software doesn't work for situations where you can hear multiple people on the same mic, like in the offline collabs that Hololive members often do.
[00:05:16] <Bco1981> ^
[00:05:35] <Cryowolf> I've heard voice actresses able to go really low in their voice without the aid of a computer...Cause I was next to them
[00:05:41] <Cryowolf> it's impressive
[00:05:59] <Cryowolf> but they say it's very straining on their vocal cords to go that low and they charge a shitload more for it
[00:06:00] <Bco1981> HoloEN Kronii does that

[00:06:22] <MootPoot> its weird
[00:06:31] <MootPoot> meanwhile me - I have my monotone voice
[00:06:44] <MootPoot> if I try to change my voice at all it basically cuts out
[00:06:56] <S_T_A_N> Cryowolf, re amazon reviews. People are fucking stupid
[00:07:17] <Cryowolf> Voice actors/actresses that can totally fool me that they are different people (or characters voiced by different people) are the ones I'm most impressed by. And I mean without the aid of software
[00:07:22] <Cryowolf> S_T_A_N, yes they are

[05:28:29] <amigojapan> Yep ghab13 
[05:28:53] <amigojapan> ghab13: her videos are still there
[05:28:54] <Nanobot> amigojapan: It's part of being a VTuber. There are lots of VTubers who have separate identities, and most of them try to keep those identities separate.
[05:29:26] <amigojapan> I see Nanobot

[05:30:24] <ghab13> Ye
[05:30:33] <Nanobot> I doubt there's anything *preventing* Kson from explicitly saying she was Coco; she just chooses to keep them separate.

[05:31:34] <Nanobot> Fubuki voiced a cameo of herself, and I think someone else did, too.

[05:34:20] <ghab13> Kek
[05:34:33] <Nanobot> I've been eating mostly ice cream and doritos lately, and I've been losing weight. Hooray for diets.
[05:34:49] <MootPoot> for some reason I've stopped losing weight and it dosen't make sense
[05:34:54] <MootPoot> I'm eating less, doing it all right
[05:34:55] <ghab13> Is kson an independent vtuber now? 
[05:35:26] <amigojapan> MootPoot: keto is not about eating less
[05:35:36] <amigojapan> ghab13: yes
[05:35:38] <Nanobot> ghab13: Yeah, although she's been doing a lot of collabs with vshoujo and pikamee
[05:35:44] <ghab13> Oke
[05:36:45] <Nanobot> I'm just curious how she'll eventually do something with Hololive.
[05:36:59] <ghab13> Anniversary prolly

[05:37:12] <MootPoot> amigojapan: if you eat 5000 calories a day in keto you're still going to gain weight

[05:40:56] <ghab13> Ah

[09:11:33] <Nanobot> The last 10 or so boxes of EasyMac I've purchased, over the course of the last couple of years, have contained at least one cheese packet that came unsealed, with the contents spilling everywhere. They seem to be cutting some of the packets at an angle, which means the cut goes into the content. This sounds to me like potential grounds for a class action lawsuit.

[17:00:42] <Sadale> alright. Now that I get why I couldn't figure out how to solve this shit. That's because I was never taught that
[17:01:53] <isekaijin> If 2 <= y <= 3, then abs(y - 2) + abs(y - 3) = (y - 2) + (3 - y) = 1 is true for any y. Again, we postpone finding the values of x that make this work.
[17:02:25] <isekaijin> If y >= 3, then abs(y - 2) + abs(y - 3) = (y - 2) + (y - 3) = 2y - 5 = 1, hence y = 3. Again, we postpone finding the value of x that makes this work.
[17:03:22] <isekaijin> We have deduced that y can take any value such that 2 <= y <= 3. Hence x = 1 + y^2 can take any value such that 5 <= x <= 10.
[17:03:33] <isekaijin> Warning: I haven't double-checked this.
[17:03:41] <Berlin36> @_@
[17:04:50] <Sadale> Thank you isekaijin :3
[17:05:09] <Sadale> Berlin36, HubertFarnsworth , ^ That's far more complicated than I thought...
[17:05:28] <Berlin36> it's not easy for me either
[17:05:29] <Berlin36> lol
[17:05:36] <Sadale> Clearly it's something that I can't solve. That's why I'd resort using a computer to solve the value of x. :P
[17:05:55] <isekaijin> lol, it's useless IRL, I have never seen a problem like this one arise in a physical situation
[17:06:04] <isekaijin> There's useful math, but not problems like this one.
[17:06:14] <Sadale> It's useful for dealing with useless exams :P
[17:06:18] <Sadale> just like Berlin36!
[17:07:25] <Berlin36> yeaaaaah exactly
[17:07:53] <Berlin36> and even if there were situations where you'd need all this stuff.. just use a calculator ?
[17:08:10] <isekaijin> Actually, for this problem, a calculator wouldn't be too useful.
[17:08:23] <isekaijin> Math problems are often designed to make calculators useless.
[17:08:42] <isekaijin> Supposedly because the point is “testing your brain, not the calculator”.
[17:08:49] <Berlin36> yeah
[17:08:52] <Sadale> I mean I'd be just brute forcing the value of x
[17:09:00] <isekaijin> haha

[17:14:00] <isekaijin> Sadale: Machine learning is made possible by today's powerful computers, but even then you can't only rely on brute force.
[17:14:06] <Sadale> isekaijin, Interesting. So the answer of Berlin36 is actually wrong. The answer that Berlin36 mentioned was only 5 and 10
[17:14:23] <HubertFarnsworth> Berlin36: got it
[17:14:24] <isekaijin> The correct answer is the whole interval from 5 to 10, and that's what I said before.
[17:14:25] <Urchin[emacs]> Sadale: correct-ish is a funny term, considering specification gaming (essentially ML algorithms invented laziness)
[17:14:27] <Sadale> isekaijin, In fact by saying only 5 and 10, you're missing all the answers in between
[17:14:32] <isekaijin> Yes.
[17:14:53] <HubertFarnsworth> not the interval isekaijin

[19:28:53] <MootPoot> Bco1981: its funny but prebuilts are the only guranteed way to get a 3080 etc these days for a normal ish price
[19:30:06] <Bco1981> yeah
[19:31:04] <Bco1981> but the 3050 can do vr, it can beat a gtx 970/gtx1060
