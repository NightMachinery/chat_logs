[15:05:48] <FreeBDSM> both worked
[15:06:28] <FreeBDSM> does zsh's behavior for !! and !:${blah} differ from bash's?
[15:07:34] <FreeBDSM> because as far as I googled (afaig, lol) `echo a b; echo !:-1` should become `echo b`, but instead becomes `echo echo a`

[15:08:43] <FreeBDSM> ah, google lies, bash does the same
[15:10:24] <ft> There are a couple of options in zsh that modify !-history expansion.
[15:10:53] <FreeBDSM> how to reference last command's last 1 arg? last 2 args?
[15:12:57] <FreeBDSM> also, is there some trick or a bindkey to make history references/expansions (I don't know how to properly call stuff like `!!`) to make it get replaced in the current command PRIOR TO executing that command?
[15:13:26] <Mikachu> you probably want histverify
[15:14:19] <FreeBDSM> Mikachu: that's not a command, what is it? a setopt option?
[15:14:33] <FreeBDSM> or a shell variable?

[19:04:59] <n000g> Hi, I'm trying to run vim on multiple text files. Works fine in a for-loop, but vim errors "input is not from a terminal" when I try a while-loop. What am I doing wrong?
[19:07:49] *** Quits: bartholin (~bartholin@109.53.4.88) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[19:12:11] <Mikachu> well, what are you actually doing?
[19:14:59] <ectospasm> n000g: while loops generally use redirection, and you're redefining standard input when you do that.
[19:15:27] <ectospasm> So, that means input is no longer from a terminal.
[19:16:46] <Mikachu> that's a very strange generalization
[19:17:28] <Mikachu> i guess you mean if you do something like while read; do blabla; done < list?
[19:20:22] <Hello71> yaymukund: it would be easier to test if you just do cmd1; echo $? then cmd2; echo $?

[19:26:20] <ectospasm> I know I've had similar problems in the past.  Redirection can be tricky!
[19:27:36] <Mikachu> you can do something like while read -u 3; do vim $REPLY; done 3< file instead
[19:27:54] <Mikachu> or vim < /dev/tty
[19:29:16] <ectospasm> Mikachu: yes, but that takes more intention, which is not always obvious for beginners, or even some seasoned users.

[22:38:20] <Mikachu> it returns on true, so if it passes that line then there was a state set (or no matches added), then it just grabs service manually from the next word

[22:54:27] <UndeadLeech> Maybe it's easier this way around: Currently I have this completions script https://paste.rs/wSt.zsh, however it seems like this is not idiomatic and for some reason the parameters don't work for the `msg` subcommand (only its subcommand works). Any suggestions for improvement?
[22:55:06] <UndeadLeech> I'm somewhat tempted to just not provide completions for subcommands because at this point the time necessary to write them would likely be better spent elsewhere.
[22:55:16] <Mikachu> _main is an extremely problematic function name, you should namespace these more :)
[22:55:53] <Mikachu> (it's not the cause of your issues though)
[22:55:55] <UndeadLeech> That's a fair point, though that doesn't appear to be an issue.
[22:56:22] <Mikachu> generally helper functions in completers are named like _alacritty_whateverhelper
[22:57:26] <UndeadLeech> Yeah I've seen that in gits completions. Seems like a reasonable convention.
[22:58:11] <Mikachu> you seem to be trying to use subcmds in _first_param, but it's defined only in _msg
[22:58:19] <Mikachu> oh nm i can't read
[22:58:59] <Mikachu> the git completer for some reason has double underscores but i don't think there's any reason to do that
[22:59:33] <UndeadLeech> The definition seems to work, because `alacritty msg create-window` is suggested. But for some reason the second `_arguments` call defined right after just doesn't appear to work. I'd assume it's something to do with how _arguments works but I'm just not familiar with its internals. Can this not be called multiple times?
[23:00:26] <Mikachu> i'm not sure what it is that should be completed that isn't?
[23:00:55] <UndeadLeech> `alacritty msg --socket` should work. But doesn't.
[23:01:21] <UndeadLeech> Like completed from `alacritty msg --s` or whatever.
[23:01:33] <Mikachu> ah, yeah that's a bit of a weird thing to do
[23:01:37] *** DHowett_ is now known as DHowett
[23:01:42] <Mikachu> just add a *:subcmds to the _arguments call?
[23:01:52] <Mikachu> (but with the correct syntax)
[23:01:59] <UndeadLeech> To which one?
[23:02:04] <Mikachu> the one in _msg
[23:02:11] <Mikachu> so you don't call both _describe and _arguments
[23:02:44] <UndeadLeech> That works? I couldn't figure out how to get subcommands offered in _arguments with it properly completing.
[23:03:17] <Mikachu> alternatively you could use _alternative but calling arguments from alternative is a bit ridiculous :)
[23:03:57] <Mikachu> yeah it would be something like "*: :($subcmds)" i think
[23:04:49] <Mikachu> oh or (( )) if it has descriptions
[23:05:00] <UndeadLeech> That would just add each word to the suggestions, without any descriptions, right?
[23:05:05] <UndeadLeech> Nvm.
[23:06:23] <Mikachu> the colons may need to be prefixed with a \ in this case too
[23:06:58] <UndeadLeech> Okay, when I do that I still only get the subcommand suggested.
[23:07:28] <Mikachu> did you type - before pressing tab?
[23:07:51] <UndeadLeech> Wait, why are options not suggested if you don't have `-`?
[23:08:02] <Mikachu> that's how completion always works
[23:08:11] <UndeadLeech> It shouldn't be.
[23:08:20] <Mikachu> well, it's not a problem with your completer in any case
[23:08:35] <UndeadLeech> Well it is. Because it doesn't make sense.
[23:08:59] <UndeadLeech> You'd want to write `alacritty msg --socket /tmp/whatever.sock create-window`.
[23:09:11] <Mikachu> so if you're in a directory with only one subdirectory, you would want cd <tab> to offer -L -P thatdir/ instead of just completing thatdir/ right away?
[23:09:33] <UndeadLeech> thatdir/ isn't a subcommand though.
[23:09:41] <Mikachu> it's an argument that doesn't start with a -
[23:11:00] <UndeadLeech> It's a parameter rather than an option though.
[23:11:14] <UndeadLeech> Ergonomically this blows, though I guess at least it somewhat works now.
[23:11:34] <Mikachu> well, i'm sure you can probably configure that differently as an end-user if you prefer
