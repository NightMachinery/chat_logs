[15:17:01] <artchad> mfiano: you know how to capture the mouse inside the SDL2 window?
[15:23:00] <mfiano> look for the relative mouse mode api
[15:24:52] <artchad> roger
[15:29:53] <artchad> well, that was easier than anticipated.
[15:30:25] <artchad> So, wherever SDL_bool would be used, I could just use an integer like 0 or 1?

[17:32:45] <artchad> borodust: Could it be that texture data is fed upside down into texture objects in OpenGL?
[17:32:56] <artchad> it's flipped horizontally and vertically.
[17:33:04] <artchad> at least that's how it looks like to me

[18:13:33] <borodust> artchad: that solely depends how you lay out your data
[18:14:24] <borodust> most images are y flipped, cuz opengl tex coords use y-upward system, while the rest of the 2d graphics use y-downwards system
[18:14:49] <borodust> that's why many image/texture loaders has y-flipping option

[22:20:07] <artchad> If I use (gl:ortho left right bottom top near far) what is the difference if I swap bottom and top for example?
[22:20:19] <artchad> the range still stays the same or not?
[22:20:31] <artchad> but things are projected upside down?
[22:21:00] <borodust> there's three ways to figure that out ;p
[22:21:23] <borodust> look into produced ortho matrix and what it does
[22:21:29] <borodust> just try it out
[22:21:48] <artchad> I just tried it out and it flips everything
[22:21:54] <borodust> yay
[22:22:04] <artchad> the question is wether that's actually what it does, or wether it just appears to do that.
[22:22:11] <artchad> I don't like assuming things.
[22:22:17] <artchad> leads to a lot of headaches.
[22:22:51] <artchad> Maybe I should next time just do the matrix multiplication by hand. That would make things clear. I'm just too lazy for that.
[22:22:57] <artchad> i'd rather ask
[22:30:29] <borodust> :thumbs-up
[22:34:42] <artchad> I'm slowly chipping away at opengl
[22:34:46] <artchad> slowly but surely.
[22:36:28] <borodust> hey, that's great!
[22:38:45] <artchad> When I finally get to a point, where I can comfortably manage sprite sheets, that would suffice for some time, until I finally want to start using 3.3 instead of 2.1. I'm currently kinda learning 2.1 and a bit of 3.3
[22:43:18] *** Quits: notzmv (~zmv@user/notzmv) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[22:46:31] <borodust> well, if you get 2.1 to work for you, as far as your goals go, you really can stop there
[22:46:46] <borodust> this will give you much broader audience and hardware support
[22:47:10] <borodust> back in the days, i've got quite a few requests for 2.1 support in gamekit 
[22:47:32] <borodust> enough requests for me to actually go through with them :)
[22:48:41] <borodust> the only problem with it, again, for your goals, there are probably not enough examples for it around the internets
[22:49:02] <artchad> I could make 3.3 optional. I would query the capabilities at runtime and just disable fancy shaders.
[22:49:28] <artchad> Shader programming is a lot of fun. 
[22:49:36] <borodust> this is very true
[22:49:39] <artchad> I've only done fragment shaders in Godot though
[22:49:43] <borodust> interactive shader programming is a blast
[22:50:09] <artchad> Godots preview is kinda interactive
[22:50:35] <artchad> but I'm hyped for doing it the truly interactive lisp way. ^^
[22:50:41] <borodust> Baggers knows, so we have CEPL now ;p
[22:51:08] <artchad> CEPL needs tutorials
[22:51:17] <artchad> although he seems to be kinda back to lisp?
[22:51:30] <artchad> I hope will eventually update the docs.
[22:51:42] <artchad> and the videos are deprecated
