[08:32:49] <MetaNova> it's valid
[08:33:07] <MetaNova> but perhaps a bit unwieldy. I personally don't think I've ever used it

[08:34:02] <LjL> "I'd've" in spoken form is not at all uncommon

[08:38:07] <MetaNova> ns12: the second contraction is not mandatory

[08:48:53] <LjL> contractions are really a matter of style. in some quite formal written registers you're supposed to avoid *all* contractions, but apart from those, you can mix and match contracted and uncontracted forms
[08:49:20] <LjL> there are also alternatives like "it's not" vs "it's isn't" and in most cases they're equivalent and it's a matter of style

[12:45:14] <ouzel8> Nothing specific at this point, I am eager to understand more about the purpose of elision, and then its use.
[12:45:20] <energizer> i kinda think this is bs
[12:46:11] <energizer> nobody says /ˈnætʃərəl/

[12:48:14] <ouzel8> This is an example that I am interested in.
[12:48:22] <energizer> ok "gonna" is a real example
[12:49:18] <energizer> ouzel8: which is?
[12:50:44] <energizer> leaving out syllables makes some words sound better
[12:50:58] <energizer> especially common in an informal context
[12:51:06] <ouzel8> Often when reading the IPA pronunciation for words the 'ə' sound is between brackets '(ə)'. I have read that this means that you miss this sound when pronouncing the word. Is this eliding the sound, and related to elision?
[12:52:12] <energizer> https://english.stackexchange.com/a/341491/419268
[12:53:51] <energizer> these are good https://englishexplorations.check.uni-hamburg.de/connected-speech-elision/
[12:54:05] *** Joins: hackinghorn (~hackingho@user/hackinghorn)
[12:56:01] <energizer> for some of these you'd always elide; for others it's more optional 
[12:57:02] <ouzel8> The "gonna" example is not straight forward. It is not clear that by omitting a sound or syllable that then. "going to" becomes "gonna", and in more detail "ɡoʊ.ɪŋ tuː" becomes "ɡənə" after elision.
[12:57:19] <ouzel8> I think that this is not a good example.
[12:57:29] <energizer> fair enough
[13:00:58] <energizer> i always elide in "interesting". some people don't but it seems like an affectation to me
[13:02:20] <energizer> i dont notice any particular elision in "police"
[13:02:59] <energizer> but all the other ones are normal
[13:06:10] <ouzel8> I am eager to understand this in more detail, if anyone else has more knowledge to share, I would greatly appreciate it.
[13:10:15] * energizer retracts bs claim, but some of them seem overblown
[13:11:15] <energizer> it's not clear to me what the elision is supposed to be relative to
[13:13:17] <energizer> in "vegetable", i dont know anybody who says it like that but i'm also not convinced there's an elision. it's standard in linguistics to make the spoken form primary. so saying the syllable is elided relative to the spelling seems odd
[13:13:56] <energizer> like, why not say there's an extra few letters in the written form
[13:14:42] <energizer> anyway i dont know what i'm talking about and you're looking for a serious answer so i'll be quiet
