[04:25:56] <biys> i would say it depends, but not entirely
[04:26:43] <causative> the current state of patent law is excessive, given the pace of technology we do not need 20 year protection for every new web app
[04:26:58] <causative> 5 years or 2 years should be sufficient
[04:26:59] <causative> same for copyright
[04:27:23] <causative> incentive to produce must be balanced against the value of getting the inventions into the public domain
[04:27:27] <biys> i think IP is important
[04:27:29] <biys> TBH
[04:27:53] <apotheon> The incipient state of patent law in the US in the 1700s inexorably led to the state of patent law today.
[04:28:08] <causative> the ideal goal of IP should be to maximize the amount of good works and inventions available in the public domain
[04:28:41] <causative> IP is useful as an incentive to invent and produce without being immediately copied, but then it needs to end so that the public domain gets it
[04:28:44] <apotheon> Patents on steam engines essentially stopped automation innovation in its tracks for ten years.
[04:29:13] <apotheon> causative: Patents only move incentives from some forms of innovation to others.
[04:29:56] <apotheon> The others are eventually going to be heavily weighted toward things that are both easy to patent and difficult to work around by others, to impose economic rents.
[04:30:29] <apotheon> (not the same as "rent" in the sense of an apartment; more like a protection racket or, more accurately, a vacant lot scam)
[04:31:26] <apotheon> (most accurately, the bastard love child of a protection racket and a vacant lot scam; when a racket and a scam love each other very much . . .)
[04:33:08] <apotheon> The movement of incentivese from one thing to another is often called "perverse incentives" in economic discussions.
[04:35:42] <causative> that's not the definition of perverse incentives
[04:35:56] <causative> perverse incentives are when you have an incentive to do something harmful to society
[04:36:07] <causative> movement of incentives from one thing to another can be good or bad
[04:36:15] <causative> depending on which thing is more beneficial for society
[04:37:16] <apotheon> "That's not perverse incentives.  Perverse incentives are [what you said]."
[04:37:21] <apotheon> Thanks for supporting my point.
[04:38:16] <apotheon> When you optimize for what's easy to get and easy to use to stand in the way of further innovation as a gatekeeper, you are no longer optimizing for the most useful innovations for what people are willing to buy from you.
[04:39:13] <apotheon> What part of "optimizing for being a patent troll" is better for society than "optimizing for a cancer cure"?
[04:39:13] <causative> well, yes, it's not perfectly aligned, but it may be better than a situation with no patents or copyright, where everything you invent can immediately be ripped off by a competitor for little cost by them
[04:39:37] <causative> you can see that a corporation would have a hard time justifying a research department in that case
[04:40:01] *** Quits: Inline (~Inline@2a02:908:1252:7a80:eac0:c033:fea2:56dd) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[04:40:06] <apotheon> The answer to the "ripped off" thing is not imposing artificial scarcity on society and granting gatekeeper monopolies for invention: the answer is "It's not my fault your fucking business model sucks."
[04:40:24] <causative> as a society we want to reward innovation in order to promote more of it
[04:40:33] <causative> if innovation as a business model sucks, that's a problem for all of society
[04:40:53] <apotheon> Innovation as a business model only sucks when it's getting the life squeezed out of it by patents.
[04:41:22] <causative> I'm speaking of "a situation with no patents or copyright, where everything you invent can immediately be ripped off by a competitor for little cost by them"
[04:41:29] <causative> as were you
[04:41:38] <causative> so, *not* the current situation with patents
[04:41:58] <apotheon> Watch trillions of dollars go down the drain because of "look and feel" patents for smartphones while nobody gives two shits about producing better privacy mechanisms.  It's much easier to get a "look and feel" patent that keeps competitors from competing than to actually give people what they need.
[04:42:23] <apotheon> Okay, let me rephrase the thing you didn't understand:
[04:42:42] <apotheon> Innovation as a business model doesn't suck when it's not getting the life squeezed out of it by patents.
[04:43:02] <apotheon> Is it clearer now how that pertains to a world without patents?
[04:43:18] <causative> but it seems like it would suck, because your competitor could rip off your new invention for little cost by them
[04:43:29] <causative> so you'd go out of business, as they'd produce the same thing as you for lower costs
[04:43:31] <apotheon> The solution is to have a business model.
[04:43:37] <apotheon> . . . not a protection model.
[04:43:54] <apotheon> If you're operating under a protection model, then sure, patents are necessary.
[04:44:08] <causative> okay say you have invented a cool new robotic lawnmower, superior to all other lawnmowers and not more expensive to make
[04:44:19] <causative> you want to sell this to residential customers
[04:44:26] <causative> is this a bad business model? how would you fix it?
[04:45:14] <causative> (in the hypothetical world without patents or copyright, so that your competitor can easily copy your lawnmower and make his own)
[04:45:20] <apotheon> Build the *specifics* of the model out of things like your first mover advantage, your superior understanding of the technology, and so on.  "Sell something" isn't a business model, so what you described is not a business model.
[04:45:46] <apotheon> specifics of the business model, that is
[04:46:11] <causative> your superior understanding of the technology only lasts until the other guy copies your source code and schematics
[04:46:23] <causative> then it doesn't matter if he understands or doesn't, his product will be the same as yours
[04:46:35] <apotheon> It's getting to the point where it's not even really controversial amongst active, thinking economists that patents are a net loss to society.
[04:46:57] <causative> well, that's a different question
[04:47:10] <apotheon> causative: Yes, you don't get to rest on your laurels with no further innovation for twenty fucking years any longer; you have to actually innovate to stay ahead, thus motivating innovation.  That's what a lack of patents does.
[04:47:30] <causative> what if it takes you five years to develop your lawnmower and two months for the other guy to copy it?
[04:48:02] <causative> is it too much to ask to rest on your laurels for a year or two, profiting off your risky R&D?
[04:48:32] <apotheon> It'll also take your competitor one to five years for the competitor to achieve significant market penetration, reliability and per-unit costs will be initially higher (especially without really understanding the tech), and so on.  Many factors favor the first mover.
[04:49:28] <causative> this is not really a hypothetical
[04:49:42] <causative> US products manufactured in China are immediately copied
[04:49:44] <causative> it doesn't take years
[04:49:55] <causative> the only thing stopping them from outcompeting the originals in the US, is branding and IP law
[04:50:20] <apotheon> The better question is whether it's really too long a time to allow people to be restricted from exercising free will and expression by imposing legal prohibitions on innovation.
[04:50:54] <apotheon> People's actual rights are being infringed by telling them what they can and cannot do with material objects in their possession.
[04:51:20] <causative> what people's rights are, or are not, is something we should decide based on what benefits society most
[04:51:32] <apotheon> When your *manufacturer is doing the copying*, that's a different matter, and should be handled by way of contract law.
[04:51:37] <causative> rights are not something people inherently have, it's something we agree on, hopefully for the benefit of society
[04:52:13] <apotheon> causative: Rights are not a societal decision.  The law is, and while the law may claim something is or is not a right, the law's claims cannot change the value of pi, either.
[04:52:41] <causative> apotheon so now you *do* supporting a concept of IP enforced by contract law, between designer and manufacturer?  You want the manufacturer not to be allowed to sell or copy the IP they receive from the designer?
[04:52:48] <causative> s/supporting/support/
[04:52:48] <ro-bot-o> causative meant to say: apotheon so now you *do* support a concept of IP enforced by contract law, between designer and manufacturer?  You want the manufacturer not to be allowed to sell or copy the IP they receive from the designer?
[04:53:02] <apotheon> In an ideal world (except not ideal enough to have no laws), the law would only codify ethics, not create them out of some politician's sphincter.
[04:53:18] <apotheon> causative: contract law is not "intellectual property", just an agreement
[04:53:35] <causative> very well, you don't want to call it IP, but it does seem to function similarly to IP
[04:53:52] <apotheon> for an extremely limited use case, kinda
[04:53:53] *** Quits: Fohsap (~Muimi@2001:19f0:6001:e4d:5400:3ff:fe41:8d5b) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[04:53:55] <apotheon> The difference is this:
[04:55:04] <apotheon> The manufacturer explicitly and willingly agrees to a specific set of conditions established in advance, acting with knowledge of the circumstances and specifics of the contract, while Joe Blow down the street who accidentally invents the same thing earlier than someone else but gets to the patent office later didn't agree to shit and now he gets his ass sued off.
[04:55:24] <apotheon> One is an explicit, freely made agreement.  The other is prior restraint.
[04:55:54] <apotheon> How can you own ideas in another person's head?  Only by way of a deeply fucked up sense of "property".
[04:56:24] <apotheon> Of course, one does not even really own the idea itself under law, because that's farcical.  It's ownership of a *monopoly* on an idea.
[04:56:32] <causative> with the designer-manufacturer agreement, the designer *is* controlling the ideas in the manufacturer's head
[04:56:40] <causative> and he *is* enforcing a monopoly on his idea
[04:56:59] <apotheon> It's a monopoly, enforced by censorship regimes and restricted freedom of association.
[04:57:33] <causative> also, if there were only designer-manufacturer agreements between US designers and Chinese manufacturers (which there *already* are), then there would be nothing to stop the Chinese knock-offs from being sold openly in the US market, cheaper than the original and identical to it
[04:57:40] <apotheon> Okay, so you're one of those people who doesn't believe there's a difference between an agreement and coercion.  I'll take note of that and do something more valuable with my time, now.
[04:57:44] <apotheon> ta
[04:57:54] <causative> because the knock-offs aren't necessarily produced by the same manufacturer that signed the contract
[04:58:39] <causative> the first manufacturer violates the agreement, but this is not something we can practically enforce - and then what the 2nd manufacturer does is unrestrained, if counterfactually we had no patents or copyright
[04:59:49] <causative> also, it's a strawman to say I don't "believe there's a difference between an agreement and coercion"
[04:59:53] <causative> I never said anything of the sort
[05:00:14] <causative> I said, with the designer-manufacturer agreement, the designer is controlling the ideas in the manufacturer's head and enforcing a monopoly on his ideas
[05:00:18] <causative> I didn't say it was coercive
[05:00:28] <causative> but those other things are true
[05:01:37] <causative> whether it's coercive or not is again something for society to decide; society does not recognize all contracts as valid
[05:02:05] *** Joins: mikez (~mikey@user/mikey)
[05:02:08] <causative> for example, in some jurisdictions, non-compete agreements are unenforceable
[05:03:54] <apotheon> A contract is a legal instrument proving an agreement was made so that someone cannot violate the agreement without consequences, assuming enforceability.  A person making a voluntary agreement is not being controlled, but if the person intends to violate the agreement that person has acted deceptively and with ill intent.
[05:04:20] *** Quits: mikez (~mikey@user/mikey) (Client Quit)
[05:04:37] <apotheon> Is that a better response to your frankly absurd attempt to conflate control like I was discussing with honest dealing like you were trying to call "control"?
[05:04:49] <causative> what do you think of non-compete agreements, then?
[05:04:55] <causative> should society enforce them?
[05:05:08] <apotheon> Furthermore, if you're worried about Chinese manufacturers breaking agreements, then not being able to enforce them, *don't deal with Chinese manufacturers*.
[05:05:19] <apotheon> That's a simple solution.
[05:06:06] <apotheon> I think that non-compete agreements are a far more complicated issue that depends on a lot of insight into the freedom of the parties involved to enter into an agreement or not as desired.
[05:07:01] <apotheon> In principle, they're fine.  In practice, "it depends", and under current fucked up conditions of a fucked up economy, they're employed in unconscionable ways and should have the paper on which they're printed turned into toilet paper.
[05:07:21] <apotheon> at least mostly
[05:07:33] <causative> so your principle conflicts with your judgment in the current conditions.  Why is that?
[05:07:48] <apotheon> That's not what I said at all.
[05:07:57] <apotheon> Please, read more nonsense into what I said.
[05:08:20] <causative> you said, "in principle, they're fine... in practice ... [they] should have the paper on which they're printed turned into toilet paper."
[05:08:43] <causative> so it's exactly what you said
[05:09:54] <apotheon> No, what you said implied my judgement and my principle conflict.
[05:10:21] <apotheon> My judgement is that they're fine, as a matter of principle, given the conditions of an honestly free agreement.
[05:10:34] <causative> you have two different judgments:  1. a judgment that in principle, non-competes are fine.  2. a judgment that in practice, they're terrible
[05:10:41] <apotheon> . . . and the world in which we live is largely free of honestly free agreements around noncompete agreements.
[05:11:08] <causative> what makes them not honestly free?
[05:11:23] <apotheon> My judgement is not that "they're terrible" per se, but rather that conditions do not allow them to honestly be "agreements" in the first place.
[05:11:36] <causative> what makes them not agreements?
[05:11:40] <apotheon> Are you kidding with that question?

[05:14:00] <apotheon> If you've ever encountered someone truly arguing against noncompete agreements, you should already have heard all this, and shouldn't have to ask to have a sense of why I might have said that conditions aren't conducive to real agreement.
[05:14:07] <causative> you should understand that I haven't said anything about what *I* think about non-competes; I am asking after your motives for believing things, not mine.  I might give reasons why I think they aren't honestly free, but I'm asking for your reasons, not mine.

[05:15:48] <causative> apotheon, now, relating back to the main point, is it not also true that a Chinese manufacturer entering into an agreement with an American designer, is also in a tight spot, in that if they fail to produce products that are in demand the factory may go out of business?

[05:17:39] <ro-bot-o> [url] Socratic dialoguesThe purpose of a Socratic dialogue is for the participants - Pastebin.com | pastebin.com
[05:19:34] <apotheon> You're not using Socratic dialogues.  You're using a trick of post-Sophist sophistry, where you lay traps rather than question ideas.
[05:22:16] <apotheon> I'm not even sure you know you're doing it.
[05:22:25] <causative> a Socratic dialogue is about questioning the other person's position to lead them into a contradiction if you can
[05:22:29] *** Joins: ttree (~ttree0@c-73-239-62-159.hsd1.wa.comcast.net)
[05:22:30] <causative> it's exactly about laying traps
[05:22:57] <causative> your reason to participate is that if your position is sound, you will have no contradictions, and can demonstrate the soundness of your position by successfully answering the questions

[05:24:44] <causative> and also, if your position is persuasive, then you have the opportunity to describe it in depth to me by answering my questions about it, perhaps convincing me you are right
[05:25:11] *** Joins: wasd (~wasd@user/axis)
[05:26:43] <apotheon> A Socratic dialogue is about questioning the other person's position to tease out the details *and find out* whether it ultimately contradicts itself.  It is *not* about trying to push the person into saying something contradictory that may not even invalidate the person's point, which is actually just a tactic for *winning*, which is *essentially the definition of sophistry*.
[05:27:07] <apotheon> "winning" should have quotes around it and/or ™ on the end
[05:27:45] <causative> well, I agree with you that trying to simply "win" an argument is a bad faith approach.  And one contradiction does not necessarily invalidate your whole argument, but it does put the onus on you to rearrange your position or how you stated it to resolve the contradiction
[05:27:46] <apotheon> My reason to participate is null and void when you display such obvious lack of interest in the actual ideas compared to your evident interest in "winning".

[05:28:11] <apotheon> Your manner is that of someone whose intent is not honest wish to communicate ideas.
[05:28:38] <causative> in a Socratic dialogue, the manner of finding out whether your position has a contradiction, is to attempt to lead you into one
[05:29:17] <apotheon> Leading someone into a contradiction is laying traps, not finding out whether there *are* contradictions.
[05:29:49] <causative> Socrates lead lots of sophists into contradictions
[05:29:52] <causative> *led
[05:29:59] <apotheon> . . . and I'm not interested in getting sucked into sophistry over whether you're a sophist, either.
[05:30:19] <apotheon> You can have your argument with yourself.  I need to get some writing done.
[05:30:31] <causative> if you want to find out whether something has a flaw, what you do is you *look* for flaws
[05:30:49] <varde> Write what's written when wrote.
[05:30:55] <causative> the same here; if you want to find out whether an argument has a contradiction, what you do is look for contradictions, i.e. attempt to lead you into one
[05:31:22] <causative> this is the Socratic method
[05:31:31] <varde> What's a word for possible but locked in i.e. impossible to be impossible
[05:31:59] <varde> Impossible means you can't while possible means is
[05:32:04] <varde> So what's can
[05:32:37] <causative> "possible" and "impossible" are very ambiguous words, vard
[05:33:06] <varde> I see possible as neutral and impossible as hypothetically 'reversed'
[05:33:11] <wasd> probable?
[05:33:16] <varde> Could be.
[05:33:24] <varde> Seems different tho
[05:33:46] <wasd> ah, sorry, no stil vague
[05:33:48] <varde> I think it's like beauty and morality, probability and possibility, a dynamic 4
[05:33:50] <wasd> certain
[05:34:53] *** Joins: thunder (~thunder@user/thunder)
[05:34:53] <varde> Beauty is the purest knowledge, perhaps 'first to be known'.
[05:35:29] <varde> Morality is the earthy energy of which knowledge spurs.
[05:35:37] <varde> They are a dynamic 4
[05:35:45] <varde> Though this is pretty young to me...

[05:38:51] <varde> Adam and Eve as Eden as the garden (morality) and the apple (beauty).
[05:39:48] <varde> He wants to be beautiful in Eden and she wants to please him as a representation of the first move being like beauty (pleasurable to the eye).
[05:39:58] <varde> Dunno .. lol
[05:41:28] <varde> Theology in tribal times is a stepping stone to science. People trying to be intellectual without capacity to be concise even about the process their doing(which is science). When enough is known by being highly creative, we move on. No more theology needed, it's like a seed that becomes pro literature
[05:45:32] <varde> Ideally, no science exists.
[05:45:36] <varde> Why?
[05:45:46] <varde> We know all, we can create anything
[05:46:00] <varde> Everything, thus, science is redundant
[05:46:09] <varde> So theology is also the future
[05:46:55] <varde> Well you're more intellectual than I, so I'll listen to you from now

[16:36:02] <I_Am_M00t> one of the articles was about 1/5th of unaccounted emissions
[16:36:33] <zicada> i figured you were replying to my views on Greta's speach at the Glasgow summit
[16:36:40] <I_Am_M00t> it's related
[16:37:35] <zicada> my main point was that she increases hatred of politicians and the idea that we have to solve this at the international level through politics / diplomacy
[16:37:42] <I_Am_M00t> the claim is that a lot of decisions are made based on incomplete data, and that the data is incomplete due to weak efforts to demand emission reports from some countries
[16:37:58] <I_Am_M00t> zicada: so?
[16:38:11] <I_Am_M00t> she points out flaws, that's what activism is about
[16:38:17] <zicada> first of all, this is a pretty northern european point of view
[16:38:38] <zicada> it probably doesnt fit that well into an American frame of mind, because there is very little trust in politicans in the first place there
[16:39:09] <I_Am_M00t> this is irrelevant
[16:39:16] <I_Am_M00t> talk about facts instead
[16:40:05] <zicada> No, because she is listened to by a lot of northern Europeans. I think a relatively high amount of trust in the government and politicans that we have here is a net good
[16:40:05] <I_Am_M00t> politicians need to be held accountable too
[16:40:14] <I_Am_M00t> trust is earned
[16:40:22] <I_Am_M00t> i disagree
[16:40:30] <zicada> and so causing people up here to lose that trust is not a good move
[16:40:41] <I_Am_M00t> regarding climate politics have failed
[16:40:47] <I_Am_M00t> i disagree
[16:41:05] <zicada> the political process is failing less than it has been
[16:41:21] <zicada> Glasgow is the best one so far after all, this is generally agreed upon
[16:41:22] <I_Am_M00t> if an actor isn't doing their job, you complain
[16:41:41] <I_Am_M00t> doesnt matter, this isn't small potatoes
[16:42:04] <I_Am_M00t> if there are large flaws, you need to spur the public
[16:42:07] <zicada> Greta's point was that we cant leave it to the politicians, they wont do anything and just go "blah blah blah"
[16:42:16] <I_Am_M00t> ok, and?
[16:43:09] <I_Am_M00t> are you suggesting people go home and stop putting pressure on politicians?
[16:43:17] <zicada> its not possible to solve this problem by virtue signalling how much less red meat youre eating on Twitter. We need giant CO2 pulluting nations who dont care about twitter and virtue signalling to stop what they are doing, this is only achieavable with international diplomacy, eg politics
[16:43:24] <zicada> and summits like Glasgow and Paris etc
[16:43:38] <I_Am_M00t> are you suggesting people go home and stop putting pressure on politicians?
[16:43:46] <zicada> that's a strawman
[16:43:48] <I_Am_M00t> ni
[16:43:50] <I_Am_M00t> no
[16:43:59] <I_Am_M00t> that's the implication of what you're saying

[16:44:06] <zicada> point it out
[16:44:18] <zicada> if you can't, it is a strawman, it doesn't follow from what i have typed so far
[16:44:33] <I_Am_M00t> then why are you complainin when an activist spurs the public to put pressure on politicians?
[16:45:25] <zicada> thats not what she's doing
[16:45:31] <zicada> she's telling people to not trust them

[17:20:01] <zicada> *that
[17:20:30] <mnemon> in this case making up vague claims of negative climate impact to justify your dislike of greta that stems from other motives presumably.
[17:20:42] <zicada> But i never made up any such claims
[17:20:57] <zicada> All im saying is her speech generates what we in the nordics call "polikerforakt" hatred of politicians
[17:21:11] <zicada> in our culture, thats much higher than in the UK, US, etc

[17:21:41] <zicada> so from our pov, im saying that is a reasonable concern, because we can only solve the real climate issue facing us through political and diplomatic means
[17:21:55] <zicada> yes, she is too polarizing
[17:22:08] <zicada> this hampers the end goal in which we all have to work together

[17:41:19] <Ungwelian> Very few countries have the people actually deciding things.
[17:41:32] <zicada> its true that in western democracies in the last 30 years, there arent that many of the old workers left, factory floor shoulder to shoulder types. People work in offices now, and many of that base are now rightwing
[17:41:43] <zicada> whereas higher educated "elites" are leftwing, working in offices

[17:42:42] <zicada> too many low wage menial workers have views that are not compatible with the old workers parties, etc
[17:42:45] <Ungwelian> It's compacency.

[17:43:38] <zicada> ah, im Norwegian, we have pretty similar setups
[17:43:46] <zicada> pretty strong worker union stuff, and strong worker parties
[17:44:13] <zicada> but theres clearly been a lot of change. Back in the day these parties were primarily for factory workers, and the rightwing were the factory owners
[17:44:23] <zicada> and other scum, like intellectuals :D
[17:44:38] <Ungwelian> In the beginning, all strikes were illegal. Modern people would think of worker action like that as scary.

[17:45:24] <zicada> 30 years ago 70-80% were unionized, now its 50-60

[17:46:35] <zicada> everyones kinda unionized even if theyre not, becasue the organization of all business bargains with the org of all workers yearly, on wage etc, thats why we dont need minimum wage laws in the nordics
[17:46:40] <Ungwelian> Then the chiefs sit in tables with the bosses, talking shit and drinking coffees.
[17:46:44] <zicada> pretty sure thats true in Finland as well
[17:46:56] <Ungwelian> While the rest of the people wait for their decisions like good little lapdogs.
[17:47:29] <zicada> yea, its becoming a point of inequlity in a way
[17:47:41] <zicada> whereas the whole point of unionization was to remove inequality
[17:47:41] <Ungwelian> I wouldn't be surprised at all if the union bosses here joined right wing parties after resigning union positions.
[17:47:47] <Ungwelian> Yep.
[17:48:17] <zicada> they work with the parties that best represent their workers
[17:48:29] <zicada> these days, many people who are workers in that sense are skeptical of immigration
[17:48:33] <zicada> and "wokeness"
[17:48:48] <Ungwelian> Yeah, that's true too. People are losing sense of history.
[17:48:56] <zicada> eg not compatible with the left on pretty important issues
[17:49:02] <Ungwelian> Circular time is coming to a head again.
[17:49:17] <zicada> indeed, and a part of this imo is cultural export from USA
[17:49:24] <Ungwelian> Definitely.
[17:49:25] <zicada> affecting the nordics a fair bit
[17:49:41] <Ungwelian> Finland is known here as "Little America".
[17:49:49] <zicada> haha so is Norway, Sweden and Denmark i think
[17:49:52] <zicada> internally :)
[17:49:54] <Ungwelian> :D
[17:50:03] <zicada> we have a very long tradition of being USA lapdogs all of us

[17:50:57] <Ungwelian> Every government keeps selling state property, too.
[17:51:04] <Ungwelian> Another funny side of "democracy".
[17:51:12] <mnemon> Ungwelian: workers rights these days are very extensive, makes people less interested in suffering for some insignificant change
[17:51:13] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: ive said this a few times before. It would be helpful to know more about where you stand, what ideals you hold etc
[17:51:19] <Ungwelian> Almost nobody wants it to be sold, but it's sold by the politicians anyways.

[17:52:19] <zicada> too much, imo
[17:52:30] <I_Am_M00t> you think it's ok that the oil lobby has a big influence on climate summits
[17:52:36] <I_Am_M00t> i find that very peculiar
[17:52:47] <I_Am_M00t> ofc you're gonna disagree with my conclusion
[17:52:55] <Ungwelian> mnemon, oh yes, the rightwingers get intense pleasure of privatizing state property.

[17:53:51] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: i dont know that
[17:53:57] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: i think that, i mean that
[17:54:02] <I_Am_M00t> ok, why do you think that?
[17:54:35] <I_Am_M00t> i don't think they are working towards solutions at all, based on their historic role in denying climate change
[17:54:45] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: that not incliding the biggest cause of co2 emissions in talks about reducing co2 emisssion ? i feel like theres no need to even type that out
[17:55:05] <Ungwelian> Basically every year we have stories here, of how privatized parts of state - such as healthcare companies - perform insane, inhumane fuckups.
[17:55:18] <I_Am_M00t> i think they are there to make sure they survive as an industry, i think they want to push inefficient solutions
[17:55:21] <Ungwelian> Like extortion of the infirm elderly for the right to use toilet paper.

[17:56:19] <Ungwelian> The primary goal of the state isn't to make money.
[17:56:23] <I_Am_M00t> I disagree zicada
[17:56:23] <Ungwelian> For the investors.
[17:56:31] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: i know, say why
[17:56:38] <mnemon> well it kinda is, investors being the citizens
[17:56:39] <I_Am_M00t> nope
[17:56:46] <zicada> im in the middle of cooking btw, so might come and go a tad
[17:56:48] <Ungwelian> For a privatized healthcare company, investors > infirm elderly.
[17:56:59] <mnemon> although instead of dividends the money mostly goes to infra and such
[17:57:02] <Ungwelian> And if the investor can profit from some granny's lack of toilet paper, then that's how things go.
[17:57:10] <mnemon> bs
[17:57:12] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: Plato or Aristotle ? if you had to pick, which do you agree with more ?
[17:57:21] <mnemon> it's bad business

[17:58:10] <Ungwelian> It's only bad if you get caught. Otherwise it's increased profits.
[17:58:18] <Ungwelian> = happy investors
[17:58:21] <zicada> Ungwelian: private companies have it good in the nordics
[17:58:27] <Ungwelian> Definitely.
[17:58:37] <zicada> we are not lacking something USA has

[17:58:47] <zicada> :)
[17:58:50] <mnemon> you always get caught, it's just bad business to do stuff like that intentionally.
[17:58:57] <Ungwelian> And the rightwingers keep whining that the taxes are too high.
[17:59:04] <Ungwelian> For the greedy, nothing is ever enough.
[17:59:10] <zicada> better in terms of maximizing human well being, not profit
[17:59:23] <Ungwelian> The investors couldn't care less of some social tax responsibility of some company they have shares in.
[17:59:25] <zicada> yeah, taxes are always too high for rightwingers
[17:59:30] <Ungwelian> Yep.
[17:59:33] <mnemon> it's routinely middlemanagement fuckups and profit incentives do play a role but you can have similar stuff in public run instances
[17:59:34] <zicada> they want as little government as possible
[17:59:51] <zicada> which is the same as saying they want classes
[17:59:58] <zicada> they want a class system with people on the top and bottom
[18:00:02] <zicada> we dont in the nordics
[18:00:11] <zicada> and we rate the best in the world on most metrics because of that
[18:00:18] <Ungwelian> mnemon, admit that private companies are primarily looking to make a profit. Otherwise it's not worth taking you seriously.
[18:00:28] <mnemon> Ungwelian: of course they are
[18:00:29] <zicada> education, happyness, freedom, etc
[18:00:32] <Ungwelian> There you go.
[18:00:42] <zicada> because most people are the same
[18:01:04] <mnemon> Ungwelian: that doesn't mean they'll intentionally break ethical or agreed upon rules to make a quick buck

[18:01:53] <Ungwelian> They bend & break ethical rules as far as they can to make a profit, if it's viable for PR & cronies.
[18:02:01] <Ungwelian> I've seen it many times.
[18:02:46] <Ungwelian> zicada, in Finland it's definitely a class society still.
[18:02:54] <mnemon> public instances do it too plus they're even worse with getting stuff done properly with limited resources usually
[18:03:01] <zicada> Ungwelian: yeah but nowhere close to USA
[18:03:14] <zicada> Ungwelian: and no real bottom class, its middle-class and up
[18:03:15] <mnemon> Ungwelian: very little "class society"
[18:03:47] <Ungwelian> There absolutely is a bottom class. If you don't know it, you're privileged.
[18:03:48] <mnemon> if you compare to other real life societies
[18:03:59] <Ungwelian> E.g. the unemployed.
[18:04:19] <Ungwelian> There's half a million Finns doing work without pay.
[18:04:32] <Ungwelian> And many more sick & infirm.
[18:04:42] <mnemon> who's doing work without pay?
[18:04:43] <Ungwelian> With only social security as income.
[18:05:16] <Ungwelian> Past that, there's the worker class. Then, the bureaucrats.
[18:05:20] <Ungwelian> And then, the elite.
[18:06:14] <mnemon> mostly a matter of job rather than any other class divide
[18:06:28] <Ungwelian> mnemon, students, the unemployed, the sick. Many groups here are doing work without pay.
[18:06:32] <mnemon> although income levels do create some simulacrum
[18:06:36] <Ungwelian> If you don't know, you're privileged too.
[18:06:58] <mnemon> you don't need to work if you're on permanent sickness pension
[18:07:18] <mnemon> nor do you have to do work apart from study related stuff as a student
[18:07:37] <mnemon> and all of them are paid by the government
[18:07:45] <Ungwelian> The insurance court denies 90% of sick pension appeals by the unemployed, even when they have multiple statements by medical specialists.
[18:08:18] <Ungwelian> There can easily be 100 000 "unemployed" here, who are truly incapable of working, yet are denied pensions.
[18:08:34] <Ungwelian> The insurance doctors don't care shit.

[18:31:48] <Ungwelian> zicada, I'm pretty much a communist.
[18:31:54] <Ungwelian> Extreme left.
[18:32:12] <zicada> Ungwelian: anarchism ? or
[18:32:22] <zicada> should we have states ?
[18:32:27] <Ungwelian> Not a member of the communist party, but I respect the people in there.
[18:33:00] <zicada> imo the nordics have shown that we can have long standing governmenting states that are not corrupt and largely trusted by the population
[18:33:04] <zicada> we are somewhat unique
[18:33:05] <Ungwelian> Honestly, I think states are inevitable. There have to be governmental regions, and you can just as well call them states.
[18:33:15] <mnemon> Ungwelian: I'm guessing not the "He who does not work shall not eat" kind ? ;)
[18:33:27] <Ungwelian> Are there communists like that? :P
[18:33:31] <Ungwelian> I guess there are.
[18:33:34] <mnemon> lenin for one
[18:33:37] <zicada> Ungwelian: so you are a socialist, then
[18:33:49] <Ungwelian> Definitely not a social democrat.
[18:34:00] <zicada> Ungwelian: thats fine, you are anti-capitalist
[18:34:20] <zicada> and do not believe in mixed-economy, because it ends up benfitting the fatcats on the top more
[18:34:27] <zicada> than the workers who do the actual work
[18:34:58] <zicada> i sympathise and agree, i feel solidarity with your view, but i think the nordics have proven that we can "tame" capitalism to work for the good of the many
[18:35:01] <zicada> in the nordics
[18:35:16] <Ungwelian> I don't believe in that anymore. I used to.
[18:35:28] <zicada> but there is a short step from social-democrat to elitist disconnected etc
[18:35:44] <Ungwelian> From what I've seen and experienced, much of this "classless state" -talk is lies.
[18:35:58] <Ungwelian> Finland is definitely not equal for its people.
[18:36:18] <zicada> whatever the reason, please dont let it be USA and its slow destruction. With a nordic system it wouldnt be doing that currently
[18:36:35] <zicada> yeah its obviously never always true
[18:36:45] <zicada> people fall outside limit, even here
[18:37:05] <zicada> but its rarely out of malice or preconcieved
[18:37:17] <Ungwelian> Yeah. I think it's pretty much a universal moral imperative to have sympathy for the downtrodden.
[18:37:25] <zicada> its much more common that they are things we didnt consider and later implement
[18:37:33] <zicada> that seems healthy to me
[18:37:48] <Ungwelian> I hear it's better in Norway than here.
[18:37:53] <Ungwelian> Finland is largely a right-wing country.
[18:37:56] <zicada> yeah, oil etc
[18:37:59] <Ungwelian> Yep.
[18:38:14] <zicada> Finland didnt use to be that rightwing did it ?
[18:38:29] <zicada> i imagine theres cultural influence from Russia and such, huge border
[18:38:51] <I_Am_M00t> Ungwelian: Europe likes to remove ideas from the vocabulary to create the appearance that a problem has been solved. Class blindness, race blindness
[18:38:56] <Ungwelian> Well, Finns did build a "welfare state", which however is now being dismantled.
[18:39:06] <I_Am_M00t> in USA they are more open about it
[18:39:08] <Ungwelian> We also had a bloody civil war, which the rightwingers won.
[18:39:15] <zicada> ive met 8 or 10 Fins in my life that ive talked to a fair amt irl. Low number sure, and culture bias etc, but they were mostly pretty libertarian left
[18:39:35] <Ungwelian> Some of my extended family was shot by the rightwingers too.
[18:39:52] <zicada> i got my current views on satanism from these Fins i used to hang out with in Ljusdal Sweden

[18:41:27] <zicada> At the end of ww1
[18:41:42] <Ungwelian> The rightwingers also kept this torture camp for the reds at Suomenlinna castle.
[18:41:59] <zicada> Lots of Norwegians went to help Finland in ww2 against Russia, the winter war, before we were invaded
[18:42:14] <Ungwelian> One rich rightwinger felt sympathy and wrote about it. "The bloodbath is enough." People got so angry at him that he had to flee.
[18:42:16] <zicada> that was solidarity

[18:57:47] <zicada> Ungwelian: i think people have a bad time if they have nothing to do every day
[18:57:52] <biys> hahah
[18:57:53] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[18:57:58] <biys> typical response from Ungwelian
[18:58:01] <zicada> Ungwelian: if a job generates that feel of something to do, then thats food
[18:58:03] <zicada> good
[18:58:12] <I_Am_M00t> Ungwelian is probably right
[18:58:13] <zicada> something to get you out of bed in the morning
[18:58:25] <biys> I_Am_M00t: i figured you'd be on that position as well
[18:58:31] <zicada> we ought to have other things than work generate that feeling, but this is where are
[18:58:37] <I_Am_M00t> biys: hi there my friend
[18:58:46] <I_Am_M00t> how the heck are you doing?
[18:58:57] <Ungwelian> zicada, the problem is that people are not trusted to do anything useful with their time, yet the bureaucrats are trusted to push people to useful work.
[18:59:06] <Ungwelian> And otherwise useful use of time.
[18:59:27] <zicada> Ungwelian: beurocrats can be eitehr good or bad, mostly good
[18:59:30] <Ungwelian> Here this has meant, that adults have been forced to play "kiss the bunny" -games and rubs their asses with fellow coursemates.
[18:59:36] <zicada> Ungwelian: anti-beurocrat talk is rightwing talk
[18:59:38] <biys> i'd say generally speaking the bureaucrats would typically be functioning with the success of the state in mind
[18:59:41] <I_Am_M00t> Ungwelian is fighting the good fight, meanwhile biys supports Apple refusing to use USB C
[18:59:41] <biys> no?
[18:59:55] <I_Am_M00t> :D
[19:00:06] <zicada> l9ol
[19:00:06] <Ungwelian> If they refuse, as many have done out of pride and sense of mental health, their basic necessities for life are cut.
[19:00:19] <zicada> why would anyone support different shit for Apple
[19:00:27] <Ungwelian> And of course, the course keepers get fat with state money.
[19:00:30] <I_Am_M00t> because it's cool
[19:00:38] <zicada> theres no good reason other than aesthetics, being identifiably different from other humans

[19:01:23] <I_Am_M00t> i Love this, and it's a very good overview of the problem
[19:01:36] <mnemon> Ungwelian: expecting free upkeep by other people for no reciprocity is privileged as fuck. Understandable that it's often easier in social security sense than getting something useful for the people to do though.
[19:02:00] <I_Am_M00t> that law requires one standard for low power personal electriconics
[19:02:25] <I_Am_M00t> if only it also applied to wireless charging
[19:02:27] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: how do you feel about universal design ? That all design must include designs for blind, deaf, and so on
[19:02:32] <Ungwelian> Forced to demeaning rub-ass -games to appease assholes is wrong. It's against basic human decency.
[19:02:45] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: should governments be able to demand such things ?
[19:02:58] <I_Am_M00t> zicada: I'm not very knowledgeable about it. As an ideal i think it's good
[19:03:26] <I_Am_M00t> yes, i think there should be some level of enforcement
[19:03:31] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: im in the middle of it as a developer in the nordics. In my view it should be a basic requirement for any developer anywhere
[19:04:03] <zicada> but in the US it doesnt work with "individual freedom" legistlation
[19:04:07] <I_Am_M00t> in GUI this is not followed, because it hinders ads
[19:04:14] <zicada> where people argue people have freedom not to have to "deal with" it
[19:04:22] <I_Am_M00t> also... GUI just sucks in general, who knows why
[19:04:30] <zicada> GUI is very hard
[19:04:38] <I_Am_M00t> well, I don't think so
[19:04:39] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[19:04:44] <zicada> im not a designer luckily
[19:04:51] <Ungwelian> I know so many proles here who say that they've been subjected to treatment that has broken their mental health. Precisely in the name of "rehabilitating" them.
[19:04:55] <zicada> i am given designs that i implement
[19:05:07] <I_Am_M00t> i think there's a smelly fish that's leading to bad UI design, not a technical challenge
[19:05:21] <Ungwelian> With this new form of "participatory social security".
[19:05:22] <zicada> i like minimalism
[19:05:39] <zicada> hide everything that isnt essential
[19:06:35] <I_Am_M00t> GUI should be tightly regulated in the future, because it will be a fundamental part of reality
[19:06:46] <I_Am_M00t> GUI/ui

[19:09:14] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: especially when you refuse to say anything about your own views and who you are
[19:09:16] <biys> zicada: I_Am_M00t seems to believe that Apple as a company shouldn't exist because it's tactics are predatory and doesn't premote a right to repair.

[19:22:41] <Ungwelian> mnemon, social security is not the rightful reward for work, unless it's that for everyone.
[19:22:54] <Ungwelian> For working, you get wages and workers' benefits.
[19:23:06] <I_Am_M00t> zicada umad ;) I'm verifying that I'm reading about the right party
[19:23:25] <Ungwelian> It doesn't fly that you work and get social security, while some privileged working class gets wages & benefits.
[19:23:41] <Ungwelian> It's supposed to be same rules for everyone.
[19:23:45] <I_Am_M00t> the wiki article names them labour party, so
[19:23:47] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: i feel the need to nuance, consider it a good thing
[19:23:51] <mnemon> it is the same rules for everyone
[19:23:51] <Ungwelian> When it's not, it's exactly class society.
[19:24:01] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: it meant im not fully happy with "my" party
[19:24:16] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: that im willing to critique my own, etc
[19:24:18] <Ungwelian> Here, other people get paid for work with benefits, the other people don't.
[19:24:44] <Ungwelian> Other people get to choose their work, the other are subjected to extortion.
[19:24:46] <mnemon> except if you make the mistake of starting a business and lose most of the safety nets :3
[19:24:47] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: its a mistake to take that as not being fully on board or not radical enough, imo
[19:25:00] <Ungwelian> Well there we agree.
[19:25:09] <Ungwelian> Small-time companies have it really bad in Finland.
[19:25:59] <zicada> Ungwelian: it doesnt have to be a difference of opionion, small companies and leftist often agree alot in the nordics
[19:26:00] <I_Am_M00t> zicada: you know who Bernie Sanders supports?
[19:26:25] <Ungwelian> zicada, some communists find my position on small companies pretty horrifying :P

[19:26:41] <mnemon> Ungwelian: there's no extortion, if you do no fullfill the activity stuff you still get food moneys, just bit less. Kinda like if you do some useful work someone will likely pay you significantly more than the minimum
[19:26:44] <Ungwelian> I think though that people must be given the freedom to innovate and do business.
[19:26:48] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: but i undersand the need for a cohesive strategy

[19:27:14] <I_Am_M00t> 😂😂😂
[19:27:31] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: i think if you asked him on the specifics of that speech, he would agree with the leftist party of SWeden that Greta made a mistake
[19:27:32] <Ungwelian> mnemon, the last line social security in Finland has already been criticised by EU as being too small. And if you FU to the feodal bureaucrats, you can lose 40% of it.
[19:27:58] <Ungwelian> I know a person whose income after rent here is 100 euros per month.
[19:28:10] <mnemon> how much is his rent?

[19:28:41] <biys> teenagers never make mistakes
[19:28:46] <biys> they are faultless
[19:28:50] <zicada> her mental health is important too
[19:28:52] <Ungwelian> Her income here is so small because she has to buy medication. And the social security agency has refused to cover it, despite statements from specialists.
[19:28:58] <Ungwelian> The medication is vital.
[19:29:03] <Ungwelian> She doesn't get it, she dies.
[19:29:26] <I_Am_M00t> zicada:  i think he would agree with Thunberg
[19:29:34] <Ungwelian> Basically she's made to live so far below the poverty line that it's utterly inhumane.
[19:29:36] <zicada> Ungwelian: but its very difficult to come up with an objective rule for expert opinion
[19:29:36] <biys> i wonder what being her parents is like TBH
[19:29:44] <biys> i imagine she would be extremely difficult to deal with
[19:29:50] <I_Am_M00t> i think she's saying something obvious, and true
[19:29:57] <zicada> Ungwelian: what determines an expert. Sometimes they are biased, or entirely anti reality
[19:30:00] <I_Am_M00t> biys: sup mate
[19:30:13] <zicada> they may still be considered experts within their field, however nutty that field is
[19:30:28] <Ungwelian> zicada, certified medical experts, inc. specialist doctors, with 12 years of studies.
[19:30:32] <zicada> rationality requires some proof in the real world that we all occupy

[19:59:14] <zicada> Media has alot of power recently, last 10+ years. It matters more to what people think now which journalist did which interview
[19:59:48] <zicada> maybe thats not a problem in itself, but we base this on the free press right, so it matters a lot what the actual free journalists think themselves
[20:00:22] <zicada> we all ought to have the most educated informed journalists we can, who value the sacred rules of journalism
[20:00:28] <zicada> and arent just in it for personal gain
[20:01:34] <Ungwelian> Lack of people's media literacy is a big problem too.
[20:01:38] <zicada> those sacred rules are integrity, and letting the interviewee say what they mean without screwing with their statement, its about being cordial and unbiased and leaving it to the reader to make their mind up by relating the iunformation in an unbiased and informative way
[20:01:39] <mnemon> zicada: all the well meaning armchair politicians have prolly done much more harm to the "journalism" than personal gain

[20:16:09] <mnemon> Ungwelian: it was just an example of how the channel affects the info
[20:16:18] <zicada> Ungwelian: great instance of rationalizing being bad right there
[20:16:28] <zicada> i wish I_Am_M00t had pointed out examples like this
[20:16:28] <Ungwelian> Finland is a class society.
[20:16:41] <Ungwelian> Masquerading as a free society.
[20:17:10] <zicada> Ungwelian: is it between ethnic fins and ethinic swedes though ?
[20:17:13] <mnemon> Ungwelian: only classes are the swedes and the lappish though, same rules for most everyone else
[20:17:19] <zicada> or cultural swedes and cultural fins ?

[20:20:07] <zicada> they are too conservative
[20:20:13] <zicada> they dont want to change, they are like the Amish
[20:20:22] <mnemon> not really
[20:20:29] <zicada> too similar, for me
[20:21:01] <zicada> we were terrible obvioisly towards the Sami in previous decades
[20:21:16] <mnemon> apart from the recent resurgence of "nationalism" it's mostly about the ability to continue the ol' trades and the same old exclusive access to resources
[20:21:19] <zicada> similar to the US thing with native americans
[20:21:40] <Ungwelian> Why not give the Sami independence, all across Fennoscandia?
[20:21:45] <zicada> or whatever the respectible term is now, i wish to speak of them respectfully much more than the americans who took their lands
[20:22:07] <mnemon> Ungwelian: they cannot function as an independent nation without major support.
[20:22:13] <Ungwelian> Northern part of Finland, Russia, Sweden and Norway forms an independent Sami country.
[20:22:17] <mnemon> plus all the others are interleaved to the areas
[20:22:41] <zicada> mnemon: sounds similar to Afghanistan in some ways
[20:22:43] <mnemon> just go ask who actually wants to go to 1500s level of ruralism.
[20:22:57] <Ungwelian> Haven't they functioned there pretty much for thousands of years?
[20:23:08] <Ungwelian> If ruralism is what they want, let them have it.
[20:23:16] <zicada> maybe overprotecting and fixing everything for a country leaves them in a bad state in terms of defending themslelves
[20:23:37] <zicada> also now it turns out they lied about the amt of soliders, it was 40-50k, not 300k, but they got PAID for 300k, so
[20:23:47] <zicada> listed dead people and people who had went to taliban etc
[20:23:56] <mnemon> they just want their exclusive access to resources kept intact without silly tourists or other migrants yoinking a share/messing things up
[20:24:01] <zicada> USA didnt seem to realize this at the time
[20:24:17] <mnemon> plus dash of nationalistic fervor these days
[20:24:17] <zicada> even the fact that they lied about this, is more on USA than them somehow
[20:24:24] <Ungwelian> It certainly seems suspect that Canadian mining companies are going to Sami territories and strip mining it.
[20:24:44] <zicada> Ungwelian: yea and theyre the worst oil mining in terms of CO2, so they should stop FIRST
[20:24:54] <zicada> Ungwelian: and the least CO2 fuckup operations should stop LAST
[20:24:56] <zicada> logically
[20:25:05] <Ungwelian> The Canadian companies?
[20:25:20] <zicada> it just so happens i live in one of the lAST ones, so im obviously biased, just fair headsup

[20:29:14] <zicada> not sure if Finland had conscription
[20:29:26] <Ungwelian> The sense of peace during those two weeks was immense.
[20:29:34] <zicada> i had to, either that or jail, i was super leftist hashsmoker right

[20:33:16] <zicada> and then 9-11 happened
[20:33:30] <zicada> for a Norwegian i got a pretty full experience, i guess
[20:33:36] <mnemon> Ungwelian: stay there for few months in the summer and you'll do anything to escape the bloodsuckers though :3

[20:33:46] <Ungwelian> mnemon, you're in Lapland?
[20:33:50] <mnemon> not atm
[20:33:59] <zicada> suddenly snipers on the roof and US military service where lots of the personall had lost people etc
[20:34:09] <mnemon> was there for most of last year and a bit of this one
[20:34:14] <zicada> went from taking 4 mins to get to the office to 34 mins
[20:34:33] <Ungwelian> "Southern man, don't wave your hands" they say :)
[20:34:55] <mnemon> "... take an ohvi"
[20:35:02] <Ungwelian> Yep :D
[20:35:18] <zicada> i love americans and america really in many ways. and i hate it too a lot. Complex feels. Net good ? Yeah
[20:35:25] <Ungwelian> Maybe someday I'll move there. To the area around Kilpisjärvi.
[20:35:50] <Ungwelian> People say there's nothing there. But that's the point.

[20:37:40] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: at the end of the day i trust poeple to think for themeslves, but she is unecessarily splitting cultures instead of bringing them together
[20:37:55] <zicada> a leader that brings people together to fix it, would be my choice
[20:38:18] <zicada> much like Martin Luther King
[20:39:14] <zicada> he had a dream about colorblindness, and I_Am_M00t is has heard some current crtical race wokeness that says that is bad
[20:39:36] <zicada> but there is no clear argument is tehre
[20:39:39] *** Joins: betelgeuse (~betelgeus@94-225-47-8.access.telenet.be)
[20:39:49] <zicada> that "black people think colorblindness is bad"
[20:39:52] <zicada> that is not true
[20:40:12] <zicada> some people who are black, think it is so based on a specific set of philosophical ideals
[20:40:44] <mnemon> Ungwelian: have you lived in a small place like that for longer periods?
[20:41:05] <mnemon> I mean in case of kilpisjärvi you don't have anything even resembling a town for couple 100 km
[20:41:28] <zicada> mnemon: have you ever played My Summer Car ?
[20:41:38] <zicada> thats a pretty good introduction to Finnish culture and lifestyle
[20:41:40] <zicada> :)
[20:41:46] <zicada> Ungwelian: dont you agree ;)
[20:41:56] <Ungwelian> Hehe, part of it :D
[20:42:00] <mnemon> I've seen it, haven't played myself
[20:42:20] <Ungwelian> mnemon, nah, I haven't. I've spent time in the rural areas, but not longer periods.
[20:42:41] <zicada> in my life, the moments ive looked most up to Finland have been in computer-demo and scene situations
[20:42:58] <mnemon> been to any of the parties?

[20:44:50] *** Awaru is now known as Ketawaru
[20:44:55] <Ungwelian> One of my beloved memories is spending time at my friend's grandma's place.
[20:45:09] <Ungwelian> She lived in this rural community which traded resources with each other.
[20:45:17] <zicada> cool
[20:45:29] <Ungwelian> Carried milk and made syrup from the fir trees in the forest.
[20:45:45] <Ungwelian> Old wooden houses.
[20:46:48] <zicada> yeah, i feel like a lot of that satisfaction though, comes from the national-romantic period
[20:46:49] <Ungwelian> For a modern person, self-sufficiency like that is a forgotten dream.
[20:46:56] <zicada> im pretty skeptical of that period personally
[20:47:15] <zicada> cant we have the romance without the nation-building us-them-building ?
[20:47:53] <Ungwelian> Well I didn't hear any racism or foreign politics there :)
[20:47:54] <zicada> self-sufficiency is from an entirely different period, where you kinda had to
[20:48:06] <Ungwelian> The talk was for example about making yogurt.
[20:48:15] <zicada> you cant expect people growing up today to just have that, we are more like the dandys with makeup and wigs and such
[20:48:19] <zicada> to be fair
[20:48:34] <Ungwelian> Yeah, people nowadays go and hunt food at the supermarkets.
[20:48:41] <mnemon> could do it these days too
[20:48:42] <zicada> indeed
[20:49:20] <zicada> but in the nordics we have a common culture of outdoors living and hunting and such
[20:49:26] <zicada> even among kids today i think
[20:49:44] <Ungwelian> One of the greatest regrets I have is seeing all this building in the capital area.
[20:49:46] <zicada> not in the cities so much obviously, but out in the districts
[20:49:53] <Ungwelian> Like the downtown park is pretty much a joke.
[20:49:56] <I_Am_M00t> zicada:  i disagree, ;)
[20:50:03] <I_Am_M00t> you're not that good at this
[20:50:09] <zicada> but media and focus bcomes almost entirely focused on the main cities and city life and city culture
[20:50:12] <I_Am_M00t> just a semantic gamer
[20:50:14] <zicada> nobody cares about hunting
[20:50:16] <Ungwelian> Nowadays if there's nature somewhere in the cities, it gets paved.
[20:50:31] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: im just trying to be honest
[20:50:45] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: not gaming anything
[20:50:46] <mnemon> Ungwelian: just take a train/bus for 20-30 mins, lots of forests to traverse
[20:50:58] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: from a US perspective things might not fit, thats not my problem
[20:51:16] <Ungwelian> mnemon, I'd rather live next to one.
[20:51:28] <Ungwelian> The nature in Lapland is so beautiful.
[20:51:30] <zicada> ive spent enough time relanting to the US default
[20:51:41] <Ungwelian> I guess it resembles me about proles a bit. Stunted growth.

[20:53:15] <zicada> those compos lasted a few days right, some where you could work beforehand and bring your work, and some where you have to start from scratch and complete in 3 days
[20:53:38] <zicada> its about fitting as much cool shit into as little memory as possible
[20:54:07] <zicada> kinda lost popularity now that memory is infinate, you can be a wasteful programmer and nobody even notices
[20:54:31] <mnemon> there are still some areas where it's at a premium
[20:54:34] <mnemon> embedded stuff etc.

[20:56:27] <mnemon> there's also 4k version
[20:56:36] <zicada> it generates it all in realtime using procedural programming tricks etc
[20:56:38] <zicada> its sick
[20:57:01] <zicada> lots of shader things obv, GPU's are computers
[20:58:38] <zicada> nintendo games had 32k but 28k was used for tiles and sprites so 4k for actual logic i think. Those programmers would have worked differntly if they had 10 000 times more memory to work with
[20:59:05] <zicada> good art comes from restricting i have come to think
[20:59:20] <zicada> the more you restrict the more the artist has to think

[21:04:52] <Ungwelian> Family is important.
[21:05:39] <Ungwelian> When they grow too old and infirm, I'll do my best to provide extra care, because the state sure as hell won't.
[21:06:21] <mnemon> I guess, something like 1h travel isnt too bad unless you go there all the time though?
[21:06:44] <Ungwelian> It'd complicate things.

[21:08:58] <mnemon> good practice for kilpisjärvi where you won't live within a walking distance of anything :o
