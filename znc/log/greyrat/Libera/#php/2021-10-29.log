[06:21:31] <BCB> so it was just reccomended I install php-fpm in my apache2/php/mysql setup but I already had php 7.4 installed.  Can I just purge php 7.4?
[06:21:41] <BCB> Or otherwise remove it?
[06:22:01] <__adrian> ...?
[06:22:34] <__adrian> php-fpm is not a version of php
[06:22:54] <__adrian> do you mean you have mod_php or something installed, and you want php-fpm ?
[06:24:06] <BCB> __adrian yes
[06:24:16] <__adrian> you probably don'
[06:24:30] <__adrian> t need to remove it, but you'll need to configure apache to use fpm instead
[06:24:33] <Rockwood> __adrian, hi h r u sir?
[06:24:50] <__adrian> you might want to just start over with the packages you actually want
[06:26:30] <__adrian> aside: if your project allows it, or if it's a new project, you would do well to consider php 8
[06:26:34] <__adrian> hi
[06:28:09] <BadAdviceCat> BCB, can you get PHP 8?
[06:36:55] <BCB> BadAdviceCat __adrian I just install php 7.4  can I now install php 8
[06:47:44] <BadAdviceCat> Just different ways of running PHP (php as an apache module, php-fpm via reverse proxy, and it is even possible to run PHP via NGINX UNIT https://unit.nginx.org/ - ), be-careful of which package you remove, because a domino effect may occur resulting in more packages being removed than intended.
[06:48:29] <BadAdviceCat> (Why Nginx Unit? This is why: https://youtube.com/watch?v=7oOy0JNYCJ0 - But php-fpm is still fine, especially if all you're going to do is run PHP)
[06:58:42] <BCB> BadAdviceCat : nginx - nice - thanks.
[06:59:12] <BadAdviceCat> Do note that it's a separate product (Nginx Webserver, and nginx Unit)
[06:59:53] <BadAdviceCat> And you can use both. (reverse proxy to Unit, when you need to run php, the same way you would with fpm)

[13:51:53] <TinoDidriksen> You can see what's enabled for a given SAPI via e.g. /etc/php/7.4/apache2/conf.d/ - I guess the fpm one would be called /etc/php/7.4/fpm/conf.d/ but I don't use FPM, so dunno for sure.

[17:03:35] <dag> im the only user
[17:05:18] <Naktibalda> does your PHP code take a long time to respond?
[17:08:01] <dag> yeah
[17:08:49] <Naktibalda> make it faster or raise pm.max_children setting
[17:08:59] <dag> does requests run to completion if i abort the request from the browser?
[17:09:10] <AllenJB> dag: The php-fpm status page can give you a list of php-fpm workers and information about their state. See https://www.tecmint.com/enable-monitor-php-fpm-status-in-nginx/  and https://www.malasuk.com/linux/php-fpm-status-page/
[17:09:21] <biberu> dag: how much time does one of these requests take?
[17:09:31] <dag> might take 30s
[17:09:42] <biberu> that's an eternity for http

[17:10:44] <biberu> what are they doing? maybe you can move the actual work to something running in the background?

[17:12:17] <AllenJB> You might want to look at moving tasks that take more than a few seconds to a message queue-based worker process / cron.
[17:13:22] <biberu> yeah, i'd probably just enqueue the work and return some id that the client can use to ask for status changes or a result
[17:13:50] <dag> agreed.
[17:14:01] <biberu> that would only require a handler for a few ms, rather than minute-size times
[17:14:13] <dag> this particular case is a user submitting a url and the php code does a few http requests towards it.

[17:22:21] <AllenJB> Consider adjusting HTTP client (curl / guzzle/ whatever) timeouts - defaults are usually like 30 seconds, which is an eternity in network time. IMO 10 seconds is a more sensible timeout the vast majority of the time
[17:23:26] <AllenJB> That at least cuts down task time in the even the URL target is discarding (rather than rejecting) packets or overloaded
[17:24:41] <biberu> are these requests happening sequentially too? what about retries?
[17:29:55] <__adrian> dag: this def sounds like something that should be done out-of-band
[17:30:03] <dag> well i had an interesting case where curl_exec was hanging forever reaching php max execution time and then gateway timeout. still it is hanging and the php-fpm process is waiting for it
[17:31:01] <dag> the mistake was setting curl connect_timeout to 0.1 which became 0 somehow haha
[17:31:30] <dag> thus waiting forever. well it completes after 3-4 minutes
[17:32:21] <__adrian> > somehow  // it's called type juggling. connect timeout is in (whole) seconds - integer. and 0 means no timeout
[17:33:15] <dag> right thats it

[21:06:45] <dag> what is a nice hash to use when crypto properties is not needed? i just need to uniquely identify some data
[21:07:05] <__adrian> how secure do you need to be in that identification?
[21:07:26] <Rockwood> dag, lol wht is you real question?
[21:07:47] <Rockwood> __adrian, hi how are you sir?
[21:07:51] <__adrian> s/secure/sure/
[21:07:54] <__adrian> hi
[21:07:59] <dag> a collision 1 in 10000 is good enough for this purpose
[21:08:11] <__adrian> not asking about collision liklihood
[21:08:17] <Rockwood> __adrian, sir what is going on now days :D
[21:08:43] <dag> __adrian> how secure do you need to be in that identification?  elaborate?
[21:08:58] <__adrian> e.g., if someone is able to fake the hash, how bad would that be? e.g., if you're using md5 file hashes, then i could potentially engineer a file that would overwrite someone else's file.
[21:09:28] <dag> it would be harmless
[21:09:33] <__adrian> then md5
[21:10:15] <__adrian> (without knowing full context)
[21:10:51] <dag> yeah the old goto md5 hehe. the particular cache is that im caching http responses based off of request method and url
[21:11:04] <__adrian> why?
[21:11:11] <dag> yeah i just need a cache key
[21:11:13] <Rockwood> __adrian, ""
[21:11:23] <__adrian> that's not something i would ever expect to have to implement myself
[21:11:56] <dag> i am making a framework :D
[21:12:00] <__adrian> use a tool like (e.g.) varnish
[21:12:06] <__adrian> it doesn't belong in a framework
[21:12:26] <__adrian> (yours or anyone else's)
[21:12:34] <dag> lets call it a library then
[21:12:48] <__adrian> ...
[21:12:57] <__adrian> this is not a semantic point
[21:13:10] <__adrian> it does not belong in your php code. it belongs in the http layer
[21:13:40] <__adrian> do what you will, of course, but this is a problem to be solves elsewhere  :)
[21:13:44] <__adrian> *solved
[21:13:45] <Rockwood> lol
[21:14:53] <dag> most http libraries such as guzzle include some form og caching
[21:15:02] <dag> and they do it in php code
[21:15:46] <dag> and yes im also making a http client
[21:15:56] *** Quits: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[21:17:29] <biberu> dag: sounds a collision could end up serving the wrong data, possibly leaking sensitive information
[21:17:47] <__adrian> indeed, i take back my earlier advice
[21:18:04] <__adrian> this would not qualify as "harmless" in my book
[21:18:10] <biberu> indeed
[21:19:14] <dag> ah yes. i guess i do need crypto properties then
[21:19:29] <__adrian> (though if you're caching responses why not just do it by "method resource"
[21:19:33] <__adrian> )
[21:20:37] <dag> good suggestion. i think it was a cosmetic issue when i jotted this down earlier. looks better with consistent cache keys
[21:21:01] <dag> easier to delete manually with sql too
[21:21:57] <biberu> if you're caching responses, any reason not to use a reverse proxy like e.g. varnish like __adrian mentioned?
[21:22:05] <__adrian> and of course inputs (incl. authorized user) where necessary
[21:22:43] <biberu> yeah, got to be extra careful with that ^

[21:51:20] <relipse> anyone know of a good confluence clone written in PHP?

[21:55:17] <bytestream> is anyone in here familiar with php source (C)?
[21:56:50] <Naktibalda> yes, some people are. ask your question
[21:58:56] <bytestream> I had a CLI process which was evidently stuck for 24hr+, https://pastebin.com/ePcQvxCv is the strace on the process. Struggling to find a related PHP bug.. seems like it's something to do with ssl handling on sockets
[22:00:11] <Naktibalda> bytestream: have you checked what's fd7?
[22:01:59] <Sammitch> ^
[22:02:56] <bytestream> I didn't.. and I killed the processes a few hrs ago
[22:03:12] <bytestream> noted though, will check that if it happens again
[22:03:18] <Sammitch> it's a pretty big leap to go from your description and strace to "bug in php"
[22:03:29] <Naktibalda> fcntl lines looks like SET_BLOCKING_MODE in https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/10f102d790d83998c32c432831f0afc8adc70865/main/network.c#L293-L295
[22:19:27] <Naktibalda> and I think that poll lines come from here https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/11bf5ccf62388fe82a5a7e9dedb9c00200254a28/main/streams/xp_socket.c#L340
[22:19:53] <Naktibalda> which is under PHP_STREAM_OPTION_CHECK_LIVENESS   so maybe it is working as intended

[22:42:50] <Naktibalda> paule32: why are you going backwards? I told you 2 or 3 days ago that printing javascript using PHP is a bad idea
[22:43:29] <paule32> php can pretty well that
[22:43:48] <Naktibalda> so you had it done, but now you are asking how to do it
[22:44:21] <paule32> yes, because i work with many variables
[22:44:35] <paule32> and i can't echo <<< over all
[22:45:01] <Naktibalda> if you have a string in a variable and you want to generate valid PHP code of that string, use var_export
[22:45:05] <Naktibalda> !+var_export
[22:45:19] <biberu> paule32: did you give any thought to how you're going to unit test that?
[22:45:26] <Naktibalda> HTML in javascript in php
[22:46:13] <paule32> it is a mix of all
[22:47:10] <paule32> you can do things in javascript not in html, and php not in javascript
[22:47:23] <paule32> all together = html static page
