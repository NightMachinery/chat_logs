[07:13:37] <axisys> I am only interested in first 10 hosts max, (could have only 9 there) with awk and head.. can I do it with just awk ? example: awk -F: '!/ENABLED/ {print $1}' | head -10 | awk '{printf "%s.example.com ", $1}'
[07:13:41] *** Quits: seninha (~chatzilla@user/seninha) (Remote host closed the connection)
[07:14:05] <axisys> I need to place them all in one line space separated, that is why using the second awk
[07:25:23] <axisys> this worked awk -F: '!/ENABLED/ && (FNR < 11) {printf "%s.example.com", $1}'

[07:33:08] <nmz> actually
[07:33:10] <nmz> axisys: awk -F: '!/ENABLED/ {printf "%s.example.com", $1; if (++x == 10) exit }'
[07:33:34] <axisys> nmz: nice!
[07:39:09] <axisys> nmz: does this still works if I have only 5 hosts?
[07:39:18] *** Quits: yuesbeez (uid458354@id-458354.tinside.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[07:39:24] <nmz> yes
[07:39:30] <nmz> however, it will probably always exit 0
[07:39:50] <axisys> which is good. I just want less than or equal to 10
[07:40:33] <nmz> printf doesn't output newlines
[07:41:32] <nmz> but I guess that's what you want
[07:44:23] <axisys> nmz: ah, I guess newline would work.. cuz I take that output of that and feed it a program as a long argument in bash like $ COMMAND $(awk ..)  and hit enter .. but I guess that answers my question, and I dont want a newline in that awk
[07:45:48] <nmz> that's why you "$()"
[07:46:04] <axisys> ok
[07:46:23] <nmz> you can also xargs
[07:46:55] <axisys> well I need to feed all the hosts in one line 
[07:46:58] <nmz> really strange command, considering it'll need to parse the jumbled mess of url.comurl.comurl.com
[07:47:31] <nmz> welp, I'm not a bash expert
[07:47:47] <axisys> nmz: yeah the command activates those hosts but only works with less number. If I dont put a limit and feed 50 hosts it bombs out
[07:47:47] <nmz> if it works, then I guess it works
[07:47:59] <axisys> nmz: yes it does work
[07:48:21] <nmz> TIL
