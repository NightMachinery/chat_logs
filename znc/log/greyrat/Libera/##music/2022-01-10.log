[22:38:09] <artao> MusicalDillo indeed
[22:38:32] <artao> i've been interested in it pretty much since it came out, but $600usd is over my budget, in general
[22:38:38] <artao> even $400 is pushin it
[22:38:55] <artao> redempt1on it's really not ;)
[22:38:56] <artao> :P
[22:39:17] <artao> "turn around" statements often sound far more profound than they actually are
[22:39:39] <artao> MusicalDillo it includes the Promars plugout as well. Which is $100 on its own
[22:40:21] <artao> OOH

[23:05:41] <artao> can't a guy do a little bemoaning
[23:05:52] <artao> i dunno. a mile i guess. and only while camping
[23:06:00] <redempt1on> As a man try to complain very litte if at all: 1. Nobody cares 2. it makes you look pathetic
[23:06:05] <murthy> ya can go to a corner and bemoan
[23:06:14] <murthy> I mean a guy can do that
[23:06:17] <artao> LOLokay
[23:06:25] <murthy> not you
[23:06:40] <artao> jeez. i talk about that for like 10 lines and get you two jumping down my throat
[23:06:41] <murthy> you can bemoan here how much ever you want
[23:06:47] <redempt1on> whining is a female trait. when females see you whine, they associate their owwn femininity to you. Turn off for them

[23:07:38] <artao> anyhow. i'm done
[23:07:44] <redempt1on> Why do you think being inconsistent and flip flopping is a turn off to women?
[23:07:47] <artao> it was just a brief "OH NOES"
[23:07:50] <redempt1on> Right
[23:07:52] <redempt1on> well smoke up
[23:07:55] <artao> murthy i'm buying a Roland System 1M \o/
[23:08:05] <murthy> artao: awesome!!!
[23:08:10] <artao> used. includes the ProMars plugout
[23:08:12] <murthy> artao: good choice
[23:08:21] <redempt1on> I never have a problem getting drugs
[23:08:25] <redempt1on> or affording them I should dsay
[23:08:34] <artao> this year's bday self-gift ... only $400usd. used
[23:08:37] <redempt1on> sometimes pills or hard stuff can be hard to find, depending on the drug
[23:08:40] <murthy> also the big OH NOES is the disappearance of the corn not even the bees
[23:08:48] <redempt1on> Weed is legal nationwide and sold on every block
[23:08:54] <artao> a friend on facebook posted it like an hour before i got up. so i jumped on that shit NOW
[23:09:00] <redempt1on> 7-9 AM to 7-9 PM, depending on the shop
[23:09:03] <redempt1on> 7 days a week
[23:09:04] <redempt1on> no cap
[23:09:23] <murthy> nice
[23:09:29] <artao> "weed" is illegal here. but CBD is legal. And the national law loopholes allow for delta-8 and delta-10 and THC-V to be legal
[23:09:31] <artao> which is nice
[23:09:33] <murthy> MusicalDillo: you there?
[23:10:00] <artao> the system 1m will interface well with my Neutron too
[23:10:17] <artao> not a "eurorack" setup per se, as in "modules"
[23:10:28] <artao> but still a eurorack system, as in compatibility and usage
[23:10:58] <murthy> nice
[23:11:06] <artao> now i can ignore the basic eurorack stuff like VCOs, VCFs, VCA's and LFOs, and concentrate on modulation and utility modules instead
[23:11:14] <murthy> morf: CORN
[23:11:38] <artao> which is great, cuz eurorack modules ain't cheap
[23:11:44] <artao> overpriced IMO 
[23:11:53] <murthy> oh
[23:12:10] <artao> the market is overwhelmed with too many people making shit, so they all have to charge more than their modules are worth to actually profit
[23:12:32] <artao> the opposite of normal free-market theory, where high supply SHOULD lower prices
[23:12:46] <artao> but then, this is high supply and low demand

[23:20:34] <DOMF> A friend of mine got covid last week (she's double vaxed and boosted) and last night the college nurse convinced her to go to the ER
[23:20:39] <artao> i said primarily
[23:20:42] <Cale> Cloth masks shouldn't be useless. After all, they're going to catch a bunch of droplets if you sneeze and that's the main thing.
[23:20:54] <DOMF> <artao> i said primarily <-- and I'm saying even that's wrong
[23:21:02] <Cale> They're obviously not as good as a proper mask, but better than nothing
[23:21:02] <artao> people who've vaxxed and who mask are getting sick, but not ending up in the hospital
[23:21:05] <artao> mostly
[23:21:06] <murthy> MusicalDillo: Tell him that if someone is bothering him on IRC I will kick his as
[23:21:08] <murthy> Cale: hi
[23:21:09] <MusicalDillo> We can imagine that it's very difficult psychologically being homeless.
[23:21:13] <DOMF> the WHO said on a call this morning that vaccine effectiveness against omicron is "surprisingly bad"
[23:21:24] <MusicalDillo> OK lol, I'll text him :)
[23:21:33] <DOMF> So anyways, my friend called 911 based on that nurse's recommendation
[23:21:36] <artao> did they? it's been otherwise prior to now
[23:21:44] <DOMF> The ambulance sat in the hospital parking lot for 3 hours 
[23:21:49] <artao> particularly if you have a booster of a different type than your original vax
[23:22:01] <DOMF> eventually she got into the waiting room, and was in there for another 3 hours before she just left
[23:22:13] <DOMF> I ran a pox over to her and her o2 sats are 91
[23:22:24] <artao> idk what that means
[23:22:30] <artao> pox? 
[23:22:37] <DOMF> pulse oximeter, measures oxygen saturation content of blood
[23:22:38] <artao> idk what a good number is for O2

[23:22:48] <DOMF> below 90 is absolutely ER time

[23:23:16] <artao> so POX is that fingertip clip thingee?
[23:23:19] <DOMF> yep!
[23:23:27] <artao> neato. didn't know that :)
[23:23:39] <DOMF> TONS of vaxed people are ending up in the hospital though
[23:23:45] <DOMF> Omicron is severely vaccine evasive
[23:24:12] <DOMF> Moderna is starting on an omicron specific booster by the end of the month, and J&J by March
[23:24:21] <murthy> DOMF: I saw in the news there is a new variant, may be like a combination of delta and omicron
[23:24:28] <DOMF> deltacron!
[23:24:46] <DOMF> not much known about it yet
[23:24:57] <artao> hm
[23:25:04] <DOMF> I figured it was only a matter of time before the two recombined
[23:25:20] <DOMF> what I'm absolutely terrified of is omicron recombining with MERS (which still exists)
[23:25:21] <artao> yeah. that's part of the huge problem with coronavirii in general. how fast they mutate
[23:25:23] <murthy> oh ya that one

[23:29:55] <Cale> At least, a substantial part of the process of designing a vaccine is made trivial by mRNA. Hopefully we can reach a point where we're pretty confident about the way these things behave and will have a good idea about effective dosage from the outset (actually, hopefully it'll all be pretty similar if they just updated the mRNA for the spike protein to the new one)

[23:40:18] <artao> why? cuz they're idiots? o.O
[23:40:25] <artao> they really need to switch over
[23:40:45] <artao> by the time they finish the game UE6 will prolly be out, making UE4 games look fucking awful
[23:41:32] <artao> considering it's still "pre-alpha" along with their updates frequency, it's gonna be 2 or 3 yrs before the game is 1.0
[23:41:56] <artao> i bought it on sale last ..... july?
[23:42:08] <artao> and last i heard the next update will be "sometime in 2022"
[23:42:12] <artao> real helpful there
[23:42:48] <artao> they're one of them companies that wants to keep totally silent about what they're doing and not really communicate with the community except via posting user-submitted videos on their Twitter acct
[23:43:05] <artao> they're the second "early access" game I've supported, and I'm somewhat regretting it
[23:43:34] <artao> the other was Kerbal Space Program, and THAT was totally worth early access. GREAT model for other companies to follow
[23:43:47] <artao> clear on their goals and communicated constantly with users
[23:44:15] <artao> also didn't make promises then not keep em. always clear that "we're working on this but no guarantees as to when"
[23:44:22] <artao> plus regular updates
[23:44:52] <artao> the makers of Session need to wake up to the real world. stop being so fucking quiet
[23:45:31] <artao> as it is the game is fun. sure ... but lacking a LOT of stuff, and is buggy
[23:45:43] <artao> and pretty much entirely street tech skating
[23:45:51] <artao> which, for me? .... meh
[23:46:03] <artao> anyhow ... enough about that
[23:46:15] * artao goes back to reading about the Roland System 1M
[23:52:09] <artao> i'm very glad i went to the store yesterday, cuz today it is inhumane outside. NWS radio literally called it "bitter cold"
[23:52:16] <artao> windchills below -20F
[23:52:36] <artao> aka -28C
[23:52:47] <artao> aka 244K
[23:53:09] <LibertyDillo> brrrrrrrrrrrr
[23:54:26] <artao> exactly
[23:54:46] <artao> fuck that shit
[23:55:00] <artao> lasting until wednesday-ish
[23:55:37] <artao> at which point it'll come back up to only a little below 0C for like 5 days
[23:55:42] <artao> which will be nice
[23:58:15] <redempt1on> Ask Joel, redemp1on don't back down
