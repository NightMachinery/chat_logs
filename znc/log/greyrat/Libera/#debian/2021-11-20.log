[06:56:20] <somiaj> It is also not clear why the debootstrap base needs to be so small and what you get from that. minbase is about as small as you'll get in debian, as it includes all required packages.
[06:58:37] <somiaj> my frist comment was for noord who appeared to have left.
[07:00:49] <Daisenryaku> well, it's clearly advantageous if you run a container and basically only need libc, apt, and core-utils to have a footprint as small as possible. think of a CI job, everytime the tarball is downloaded it's 100MB traffic instead of 25, takes longer to untar, more disk space...
[07:02:01] <Daisenryaku> in my case i need it only to run wine in it, because i cant be bothered to get wine working on my distro, so i want it to waste as little as possible of my precious SSD space

[12:17:11] <sussudio> !frankendebian
[12:17:11] <dpkg> When you get random packages from random repositories, mix multiple releases of Debian, or mix Debian and derived distributions, you have a mess.  There's no way anyone can support this "distribution of Frankenstein" and #debian certainly doesn't want to even try. See https://wiki.debian.org/DontBreakDebian and <reinstall>
[12:17:42] <maximilian92> Is this referring to my problem?
[12:17:58] <alkisg> It sounds like the package you're trying to install is old and targets "buster" while you have "bullseye", which doesn't ship that dependency anymore: https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1
[12:18:58] <maximilian92> alkisg I understand. But is there any way to run the program nevertheless?
[12:19:33] <alkisg> Well you could try to manually fetch and install its dependencies, but that method isn't one that this channel recommends or supports :)
[12:20:03] <maximilian92> So what you would recommend is not to install the program at all?

[12:20:56] <maximilian92> They won't because of me, I will try to manually install the dependencies. Because it's not an option for me to not install it unortunately

[12:23:16] <maximilian92> well that would mean installing a Debian again, and I had quite to struggle to install Debian 11 in the first place haha

[16:52:56] <tomreyn> this may or may not be related
[16:53:49] <tomreyn> it's a jetway NUC, so a mini computer, without space for a dedicated graphics card. so your graphics are based on the intel brasewell cpu's integrated graphics processor.
[16:55:01] <yang> So teh BIOS has to be flashed from MS-DOS....?
[16:55:29] <tomreyn> This iGPU won't be the fastest, but if playing back videos in your web browser used to work, it should still work now. 8GB RAM will be fine.

[21:18:23] <yang> booting an older kernel
[21:18:48] <tomreyn> personally, i'd do the bios update, then, if it's still an issue, connect via ssh from another computer and run    dmesg -w   , then trigger the situation again, hoping that i can catch more info on the ssh connection
