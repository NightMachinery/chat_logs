[05:47:20] <Delf> How do you defend yourself from abusing authority/power?
[05:48:34] <Delf> It does not surprise me that priests or anyone in a position of authority/power abuses it
[06:08:15] <causative_> the question is how you defend yourself from *others* who are abusing authority/power
[06:09:20] <causative_> individually, the answer is stuff like, knowing your rights, getting a lawyer, writing an expose, whistleblowing
[06:09:23] <Delf> That was not the question! But it's a good question indeed
[06:09:40] <causative_> well, I mean, if you're already in authority and you're abusing power, you don't have the will to "defend" yourself from doing that
[06:09:46] <causative_> you're just going to do it because you want to
[06:10:17] <causative_> so the question of how to defend *yourself* from abusing *your own* authority isn't meaningful
[06:10:35] <Delf> No...
[06:10:37] <causative_> if you're a good person you won't do it, if you're a slimeball you will, end of story
[06:11:02] <Delf> I might think I'm a good person, but I could be a slimeball
[06:11:54] <causative_> well, you could say you are a good person who is tempted, and you might ask about how to resist temptation
[06:12:07] <Delf> So either I'm good or I'm bad. There is no how to NOT BE BAD and also how to remain not bad
[06:12:50] <causative_> I think if you really care that much about resisting temptation, you'll be able to do it
[06:13:14] <Delf> What about being an assholes and abusing my authority without being aware of it being abuse?
[06:13:31] *** Joins: shea (~shea@user/shea)
[06:13:32] <Delf> Ignorance
[06:13:49] <causative_> not realistic, they know it's abuse
[06:14:12] <Delf> Emotions can cloud your judgement
[06:14:44] <Delf> You may seek to justify your actions so that you don't even have to consider the possibility of you having abused your power
[06:15:06] <Delf> This is not uncommon
[06:15:23] <causative_> I doubt it - because they'll still try to hide their behavior
[06:15:36] <causative_> they wouldn't be trying to hide it if they really thought it was okay
[06:15:50] <Delf> Not hide it from others
[06:17:42] <causative_> the more important philosophical question is how to build systems that stop authorities from abusing power
[06:17:48] <Delf> How do YOU make sure you don't abuse your power?
[06:17:51] <causative_> by providing transparency and accountability
[06:18:11] <Delf> That is also good. But on an individual level, this is important
[06:18:20] <causative_> that's not an issue for me Delf , I'm the type of person to stand on principle no matter how it hurts me
[06:19:27] <Delf> That simple eh... you just stand on principle, even if it hurts you
[06:19:40] <causative_> everybody's different
[06:20:38] <Delf> There are inherent things that affect us as humans
[06:21:11] <causative_> but not to an equal degree
[06:21:42] <Delf> There are differences of course
[06:22:13] <Delf> Intention being primary. Emotions being secondary and last... your understanding or thereof lack of it.
[06:23:20] <Delf> If you MANAGE to get the intention sorted, you still got to deal with the emotions which will be fucking at the intention
[06:24:36] <Delf> Are you 100% good guy, from one side to the other?
[06:25:10] <Delf> Have you never caught yourself being an assholes?
[06:25:34] <causative_> my moral failings are of inaction - failing to do things - not of wrong actions
[06:25:59] <Delf> You didn't do the wrong thing but you didn't do the right thing either
[06:26:24] <Delf> Interesting indeed
[06:26:51] <Delf> Maybe it is not as important for you as it is for me
[06:39:11] <Delf> If you always consider yourself to be just the good guy, and always the good guy, then you will not notice how you're being less of a good guy
[06:39:37] <amigojapan> Delf: there is also the problem of many people doing horrible things with good intentions
[06:39:40] <causative_> that's true for others but not me- I'm always second guessing myself
[06:40:06] <Delf> amigojapan: Yes, there is that also
[06:40:45] <Delf> That can be either used to further justify or to not. This must be performed from within, from a position of detachment
[06:42:24] <Delf> I'm NOT the person that stand on principle. I operate merely based on intention and nothing else, all other things are secondary and not as important.
[06:45:37] <amigojapan> Delf: personally I do think intention is the most important thing. For example take someone that just got drunk and drove over someone, compare that to someone that wanted to kill someone on purpose and drove over someone. To me it is clear which is worse
[06:46:00] <amigojapan> Only one is murder
[06:46:21] <amigojapan> And that is based on intention
[07:13:20] <causative_> from childhood I was always the kind of kid to be much more concerned about rules and being right
[07:14:32] <causative_> always had a kind of logical mind, trying to make abstract sense of things and wanting the world to follow the right rules
[07:15:18] <causative_> very "systematizing"
[07:17:00] <amigojapan> Logic can lead people astray, look at all the people that believe utilitarianism is good
[07:20:08] <causative_> utilitarianism is fairly good
[07:21:44] <causative_> I think it misses a few points. However, the world would be better served if more people took a more utilitarian view on things such as the value of human life
[07:22:00] *** Quits: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata) (Remote host closed the connection)
[07:22:45] <causative_> utilitarianism is a lot closer to a social ideal than our current system, kleptocracy
[07:23:07] <causative_> if govt always made decisions based on what would help the most people for the least cost, we'd be in much better shape nationally
[07:23:18] <amigojapan> No causative_ ulititarianism is terrible
[07:23:29] <causative_> (instead of what would help the most lobbyists for the biggest bribes)
[07:24:31] <amigojapan> causative_: if you take utilitarianism to the extreme, a doctor should kill a healthy person to cure many sick people by taking his organs
[07:25:14] <amigojapan> It just does not make sense and is immoral
[07:25:39] <causative_> I'm not sure that killing a healthy person to harvest organs would actually result in a gain in QALY (quality adjusted life years)
[07:26:04] <causative_> because it would help multiple sick people live longer, but since they are sick it doesn't help them live *that* much longer, and the quality of their life is lower
[07:28:09] <amigojapan> causative_: we should not make decision that sacrifice some people
[07:28:31] <causative_> in many contexts, society is perfectly okay with making decisions that sacrifice some people
[07:28:56] <amigojapan> Yeah that is wrong and should change
[07:28:59] <causative_> warfare; hospital triage; eminent domain
[07:29:53] <causative_> hospital funding decisions
[07:30:23] <causative_> decisions on the powers and funding of social support networks
[07:30:43] <causative_> we can't avoid these decisions
[07:31:11] <causative_> as long as you aren't spending an infinite number of dollars on hospitals, there will be some people who die because the hospital didn't have enough funding
[07:31:25] <causative_> so by choosing not to give the hospital more funding you are killing those people
[07:32:41] <amigojapan> There is a difference between making an active decision and things that happen by bad circumstances
[07:33:36] <causative_> organ harvesting is dubious for the reason I mentioned
[07:33:44] <causative_> it may not be a gain in QALY
[07:34:17] <amigojapan> It does not matter, organ harvesting should not be an option
[07:34:46] <causative_> so in the trolley problem you would choose to kill the four instead of pulling the lever to kill the one on the other track?
[07:35:10] <amigojapan> It should not even be considered
[07:35:23] <causative_> too bad, this is philosophy, we consider everything
[07:35:24] <amigojapan> causative_: yes
[07:35:33] <causative_> well, that seems wrong to me
[07:36:02] <causative_> such an arbitrary distinction - pulling the lever and *not* pulling the lever are both active choices
[07:36:22] <causative_> just because one seems psychologically more passive doesn't make it essentially different
[07:36:50] <amigojapan> causative_: what if the one being killed was your wife
[07:37:02] <amigojapan> That sounds factor in
[07:37:18] <causative_> what if my wife was one of the four? there's a 4x higher chance of that
[07:39:31] <amigojapan> causative_: I would cosas muy wife , regardless  of which decision I make
[07:39:41] <audrey> You guys talkin' about the trolley problem like it's 1999
[07:39:42] <amigojapan> I would choose
[07:39:54] <audrey> Just flip a coin
[07:40:57] <causative_> so if the trolley was initially aimed at the 1, but the 1 was your wife, you would flip the lever to kill the 4?
[07:41:30] <causative_> that seems pretty evil to me
[07:41:51] <audrey> lol causative_ going at it with the most extreme examples possible
[07:42:00] <audrey> Are you just trying to rile people up now, or what?
[07:42:01] <audrey> The hell, man.
[07:42:28] <amigojapan> causative_: love wins
[07:42:34] <audrey> Take a chill pill, talk to God, or whatever you need to do.
[07:42:52] <causative_> does that mean you *would* kill the 4 to save your wife, amigojapan ?
[07:43:55] <amigojapan> causative_: well I guess I would with the trolley problem
[07:44:27] <causative_> that's just nepotism - people favoring their family at the cost of harming or killing the public
[07:44:33] <causative_> that's how you get the Mafia
[07:44:33] * audrey would rather have a conversation about how the trolley problem doesn't actually provide much meaningful insight into ethical intuitions or decisionmaking
[07:44:55] <audrey> Or, I don't know, something other than trying to get amigojapan to have an emotional reaction.

[07:47:52] <plankster> and is reality a superposition of the two
[07:47:56] <plankster> discuss
[07:48:51] <audrey> Yay, plankster to the rescue with a better discussion topic :)
[07:50:37] <amigojapan> plankster: determinism
[07:51:16] <amigojapan> "Free will" is an illusion
[07:51:55] <amigojapan> The brain is a chemical machine
[07:52:10] <amigojapan> Chemistry is deterministic
[07:53:02] <causative_> it's actually a false dichotomy, the world can be random or deterministic, and "free will" is not a meaningful concept in either case
[07:53:34] <causative_> it may be that the randomness in quantum mechanics is "fundamental" randomness, but this doesn't give us free will, it just gives us dice
[07:54:53] <plankster> but what if quantum uncertainty comes into play in our neuronic processing?
[07:55:09] <plankster> i dont think neurology is well-understood enough to make definite statements like that
[07:56:34] <causative_> "there's something that we might not understand" -> "my pet theology could be true because of that thing"
[07:56:38] <causative_> god of the gaps
[07:57:58] <causative_> even if quantum processing is significant in the brain - which the experts say it isn't, the brain is too warm - that doesn't say anything about free will
[07:58:39] <causative_> it might potentially mean that some of our actions are truly random, by inheriting the randomness of QM, but randomness is not "free will" - "free will" is not a coherent concept
[07:58:58] <amigojapan> causative_: free will does feel real tho
[07:59:16] <amigojapan> That does not mean it is
[07:59:41] <causative_> I don't know what you are feeling that you say "feels like free will"
[07:59:48] <causative_> what feeling is that?
[08:00:54] <amigojapan> causative_: like let's say I had a fork in the road ahead of me. Then I stop to decide which way to go. It feels like I can really make a decision
[08:01:20] <causative_> certainly you can make a decision
[08:01:29] <causative_> so can a computer program
[08:01:31] <amigojapan> No I can't
[08:01:39] <causative_> decisions are not free will
[08:01:48] <causative_> they're just when there are multiple options, of which one is selected according to some procedure
[08:01:53] <amigojapan> The decision was made by chemistry
[08:02:00] <causative_> which is you
[08:02:02] <causative_> you are chemistry
[08:02:34] <causative_> chemistry made the decision, which is just another way to say you made the decision
[08:02:45] <amigojapan> But my thoughts on my mind don't feel like they are being dictated by chemistry
[08:03:55] <causative_> how do you imagine it would feel if they were being dictated by chemistry?
[08:04:19] <amigojapan> Yeah. I guess you are right
[08:05:56] *** Quits: Filohuhum (~dante@gateway/tor-sasl/filohuhum) (Remote host closed the connection)
[08:06:08] <causative_> we do things for psychological reasons, which at another level are also chemical reasons
[08:06:22] <causative_> whenever you make a decision it is possible, if you introspect well enough, to dissect the reasons you made that decision
[08:06:23] *** Joins: Filohuhum (~dante@gateway/tor-sasl/filohuhum)
[08:06:40] <amigojapan> The human operating system does not represent the feeling system as chemicals too begin with
[08:06:49] <causative_> by doing so, you can draw a causal graph of the psychological events leading up to the decision - the feelings, beliefs, and habits that led to it
[08:07:17] <causative_> the more you understand the mind the easier it is to name and trace the influences causing you to act in different ways
[08:07:42] <causative_> and the illusion that your actions were "uncaused" or "free" goes away
[08:08:26] <plankster> im not so confident that brain chmestiry is deterministic
[08:08:51] <plankster> just thinking about the process of neurochemicals being introduced to receptors introduces uncertainty in the rate of uptake
[08:08:54] <audrey> Could be random.
[08:08:57] <amigojapan> plankster: chemistry in general is predictable
[08:09:10] <plankster> but in the realm of biology it is less so
[08:09:32] <causative_> well plankster randomness is randomness, not "free will"
[08:10:01] <plankster> perhaps that has something to do with the complexity of our bodily machines
[08:10:04] <causative_> you could *define* "free will" to mean randomness, but this would do nothing but add confusion
[08:10:19] <causative_> because if you mean randomness it would be less ambiguous to say "randomness" than to say "free will"
[08:10:34] <amigojapan> plankster: if it is not chemistry making the decisions then what? A soul?
[08:10:39] <plankster> lol
[08:11:13] <plankster> im suggesting that decision-making is probabilistic in nature
[08:11:53] <amigojapan> Probability does not suddenly give you a mechanism for free will
[08:12:34] <plankster> suddenly?
[08:12:40] <ldlework> at all
[08:13:14] <plankster> thats fair. but if decision-making is probablistic at all, then its by definition not deterministic
[08:13:36] <causative_> false dichotomy
[08:13:38] <ldlework> not really
[08:13:51] <plankster> ummm
[08:13:55] <plankster> yes really
[08:14:19] <ldlework> no, there's plenty of determined systems we apply probability to because analysis is hard
[08:14:27] <plankster> example?
[08:14:40] <ldlework> economics, epidemeology, and so on
[08:14:50] <ldlework> shuffle a deck
[08:14:51] <plankster> what makes you say those are determined systems
[08:14:55] <ldlework> what's the chance you'll draw an ace?
[08:15:29] <plankster> the fact that you cant determine the next action means theyre not deterministic. at least from a mathematical perspetive
[08:15:53] <ldlework> plankster: just because you, in your analysis cannot know all variables, doesn't mean the underlying system is indeterministic
[08:16:13] <ldlework> Just because *you* cannot practically determine what the system will do does not make it principally non-deterministic
[08:16:43] <plankster> oh im more than comfortable positing that there is no possible analysis that will give a deterministic outcome to economic events
[08:16:55] <plankster> mostly because you cant disprove it :P
[08:17:43] <ldlework> possible in principle and possible in practice are different things
[08:18:08] <ldlework> no doubt that in practice no one can determine future economics, that's the "economic calculation problem" after all
[08:18:20] <plankster> this discussion isnt going in the diretion i was interested in
[08:18:20] <ldlework> but that says nothing about what's possible in principle
[08:19:00] <plankster> which is the inherent uncertainty which arises from processes which occur at the scale in which quantum mechanical effects become important
[08:19:15] <ldlework> Quantum Mechanics being truly random is just one conjecture
[08:19:26] <ldlework> We don't know for sure that is the case
[08:19:28] <plankster> its not random, its probabilistic
[08:19:34] <plankster> we know that for sure
[08:19:50] <ldlework> No, our methods of prediction of statistical in nature
[08:19:56] <ldlework> But that's exactly the same case as for the deck of cards
[08:20:06] <ldlework> We just happen to know, for sure, that drawing from a deck is determined.
[08:20:11] *** Joins: mannequin (uid453465@id-453465.helmsley.irccloud.com)
[08:20:17] <ldlework> But we don't know the order of the cards, so we much apply statistics to draw predictions.
[08:20:48] <ldlework> Same goes for Quantum Mechanics. No one knows whether it's random or not, and there are theories on both sides which are on par with each other for reasonableness.
[08:20:52] <plankster> so you take the view that the order of the cards is deterministic but undiscovered, i see
[08:20:55] <ldlework> Yes, there are determinstic models of QM
[08:21:08] <plankster> i take the view that the order of the cards is unknowable without experimentation
[08:21:29] <plankster> more than unknowable. undefined
[08:21:36] <causative_> everything ldlework has said is right
[08:21:39] <ldlework> It's quite possible that the system is determined, but we can do an experiment to find out.
[08:21:45] <ldlework> We can't*
[08:21:52] <ldlework> That doesn't make it non-determined.
[08:21:57] <ldlework> It makes analysis hard, just like economics.
[08:22:16] <plankster> if you cant perform an experiment, then its beyond analysis
[08:22:40] <ldlework> Yes but something being beyond analysis doesn't give you the rope to decide arbitraily which way it goes.
[08:23:11] <plankster> of course not, its still probabilistic in nature
[08:23:17] <ldlework> We don't have "justification" to say the universe is random or determined.
[08:23:28] <ldlework> plankster: no, our models for prediction are probabilistic
[08:23:33] <ldlework> how many time does that need saying ^_^
[08:23:50] <plankster> uhhh
[08:23:59] <plankster> a few more i guess, because i dont see that as relevant
[08:24:42] <ldlework> You don't see the difference between something actually being stochastic, and using statistical models to predict a system (that may or may not be random/determined)?
[08:24:47] <ldlework> Because we've already gone over examples.
[08:25:15] <plankster> the interpretations of QM that i got in school were that there is an inherent uncertainty in events until the outcome is observed
[08:25:39] <ldlework> In our ability to predict and measure.
[08:25:46] <plankster> as in, inherent to the nature of the universe
[08:25:56] <ldlework> Literally a wave function is a wave of probabilities where we are likely or not to find a particle.
[08:26:15] <ldlework> Think about it like this
[08:26:25] <ldlework> You're using a drone to track my path through a forest
[08:26:32] <ldlework> Right as I come up to a fork in the path
[08:26:37] <ldlework> Your drone's camera goes out
[08:26:45] <ldlework> But you need to be able to predict my movements
[08:26:49] <ldlework> I could've gone left
[08:26:52] <ldlework> I could've gone right
[08:27:05] <plankster> this seems wrong
[08:27:15] <ldlework> If I went left, there's a certain set of places I could've traveled to
[08:27:21] <plankster> what were interested in is whats happening in your brain that decides whether you go left or right
[08:27:23] <ldlework> If I went right there's a different set of places I could've traveled to
[08:27:23] <amigojapan> 50 50
[08:27:32] <ldlework> This is a probability distribution
[08:27:47] <ldlework> You are not even understanding the point of the example
[08:27:54] <ldlework> You think it has to do with free will
[08:27:56] <ldlework> And response as such
[08:28:01] <plankster> not really, no
[08:28:02] <ldlework> Before the statements are even over
[08:28:20] <ldlework> plankster: once you regain control over the drone
[08:28:21] <plankster> i just dont think your example is illustrative of the problem im trying to get at
[08:28:24] <ldlework> You have to choose
[08:28:33] <ldlework> Do you search the area I could be in if I went left
[08:28:40] <ldlework> Or do you search the area I could be in if I went right
[08:28:46] <ldlework> Each location in the forest
[08:28:51] <ldlework> Has a certain probability of me being there
[08:29:08] <ldlework> Based on the direction I was headed and the physical possiblities given my different trajectories
[08:29:13] <ldlework> I am not literally in different places at once
[08:29:17] <ldlework> My position is not "probabilistic"
[08:29:20] <ldlework> I'm in an actual place
[08:29:24] <plankster> no, _you_ arent

[08:30:41] <ldlework> The chances of anything consequential in the world depending on whether you have a good understanding of statistical mechanics approximates zero so I'm divesting now.
[08:30:56] <plankster> i mean, i got a B on my stat mech final
[08:31:04] <plankster> bullshit difficult exam
[08:31:23] <plankster> but its fine if you want to think im dumb :)
[08:33:57] <causative_> the question he was driving at, plankster , was not about QM specifically, but about whether it is possible for something to be both random and deterministic at the same time
[08:34:12] <ldlework> and it's fine if you want to think the universe (and entanglement) has nothing to do with locality
[08:34:23] <causative_> I would use the example of cards in a deck. Once the deck is shuffled, it is deterministic which cards will be drawn from it
[08:34:46] <causative_> but we have to use probability to model the draw because we don't know that deterministic order
[08:34:54] <ldlework> When something is both random and deterministic, the randomness is epistemological in nature, not existential.
[08:35:05] <ldlework> Is another way to say it
[08:35:59] <causative_> so the answer is yes, it is possible for something to be both random and deterministic at the same time
[08:36:04] <plankster> ive never suggested an inherent randomness. probability isnt random
[08:36:25] <plankster> and i dont know where you got that i dont think locality is important
[08:37:12] <ldlework> plankster: you reject the notion of locality when it comes to electrons
[08:37:38] <plankster> electrons locality is confined to the probabilistic cloud of its orbit
[08:37:54] <ldlework> Also, how something can be "probablistic" (in its nature) but not be random, is just grammatical meaninglessnes.
[08:38:37] <plankster> i dont think thats so. randomness implies no underlying order. if something is weighted probabilistically, there is order imposed on the distribution of outcomes
[08:38:49] <ldlework> what causes one outcome over the other?
[08:38:54] <ldlework> you have 40% vs 60%
[08:39:00] <ldlework> what causes an outcome to be A or B?

[08:41:19] <ldlework> plankster: your ability to reason, much less integrate content from earlier in the conversation into subsequent replies you make, makes a lot more sense given your proclivity to ignore people trying  to help you understand what you don't
[08:41:38] <plankster> i understand the points youre making

[08:42:39] <ldlework> like bringing up double slit as an example of something somehow being probablistic, but definitely not random, an definitely not deterministic, even though we basically said all there is to say about QM
[08:42:56] <plankster> here i was looking for an interesting discussion instead of being told how im wrong
[08:42:57] <plankster> oh well
[08:43:14] <ldlework> those are the most interesting, for someone trying to possess acurate worldview
[08:45:53] <causative_> the basic problem is, for plankster , "an interesting discussion" can't involve someone telling him he's wrong
[08:47:02] <Delf> Is this true, plankster?
[08:48:21] <Delf> Random can be a condition that is not even possible
[08:48:52] <Delf> I see random as an limitation of our comprehension to see the structure
[08:49:05] <Delf> Not an actual thing
[08:49:07] <ldlework> Delf: indeed, if the universe is determined, then all randomness is epistemological
[08:49:42] <ldlework> and you'd still need statistical methods of analysis
[08:50:21] <Delf> It is a far tooo heavy of an assumption to make
[08:51:04] <Delf> It's like saying there are no unicorns. Are you fucking shitting me? Maybe you just can't fucking see them!
[08:51:23] <Delf> I sure as hell can't. That doesn't mean there aren't any
[08:52:12] <causative_> the concept of determinism itself is a bit hard to pin down without making assumptions about space and time
[08:52:53] <Delf> Space is irrelevant to me as is time, since I'm eternal :P
[08:53:16] <causative_> suppose there's a universe that's totally unpredictable - its state at any point in space in time is a 1 or 0 with no particular pattern
[08:53:32] <causative_> we can still speak of value(t, x) of this universe for any time t and position x, and it will always be a 1 or a 0
[08:53:47] <causative_> so in that sense all of time and space in this universe is "determined" by this function value(t, x)
[08:53:47] <Delf> Time does not even exist, for me, it's a an extension of our prediction capability
[08:54:24] <ldlework> I dunno, I'm with wolfram. The universe computational. Space is the state. Time is the evolution of that computation.
[08:55:00] <causative_> it could be that way, also perhaps it is not that way
[08:55:02] <Delf> The measurement of movement
[08:55:13] <ldlework> I even agree with him that space and time are not fundamentally the same thing, the conflation is not needed to do GR or QM and it's just a neat math trick that has some utility under the metaphor it creates.
[08:55:33] <causative_> but that's not the point I'm making
[08:55:42] <ldlework> i'm only digressing atm since i was inspired
[08:55:49] <causative_> I'm saying that you can't really even imagine a completely non-deterministic universe
[08:55:50] <ldlework> go on
[08:55:58] <ldlework> ah
[08:56:00] <Delf> This is true
[08:56:04] <causative_> there's always going to be some rule you can use to say what the state of it is at any time and place
[08:56:05] <Delf> I cannot
[08:56:11] <causative_> and that rule "determines" it
[08:56:31] <causative_> even if the rule is tremendously complex and lacks any simple laws
[08:57:39] <Delf> When you were young, you noticed that by applying logic to the patterns, you gain superiority of how things seem to be related, yes?
[08:57:58] <ldlework> causative_: there's also Aquina's point about a random universe and our ability to "know god's creation"
[08:58:32] <ldlework> two conditions must hold for rational agents to make sense in a given universe
[08:58:42] <ldlework> 1. the universe must be rational (act the same way everywhere all the time)
[08:58:46] <ldlework> 2. the agents must be rational
[08:59:10] <ldlework> if man is irrational, there's nothing to be done anyway
[08:59:17] <ldlework> if the universe is irrational, man will so follow
[09:00:00] <ldlework> (rational here doesn't mean perfectly reasoning)
[09:00:07] <causative_> well, "act the same way everywhere all the time" is not a coherent concept
[09:00:31] *** Quits: shea (~shea@user/shea) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[09:00:42] <causative_> because it would apply to the patternless universe I mentioned, which obeys the rule that its state at time t and position x is always determined by the function value(t, x)
[09:00:54] <causative_> that's "the same way" - the same function determines it
[09:00:57] <ldlework> causative_: that's acting the same all the time everywhere
[09:01:35] <causative_> but by hypothesis no agent could predict or understand value(t, x)
[09:01:42] <causative_> it's to them effectively random
[09:02:04] <causative_> the only way they could understand any of it is just to memorize specific values of it
[09:02:09] <causative_> it doesn't compression
[09:02:11] <causative_> *it doesn't compress
[09:02:18] <ldlework> right, so Aquina's remark speaks to epistemology, but it demands it existentially as a prerequisite
[09:02:52] <ldlework> your bit-field universe is the most degenerate case, epistemologically speaking, that still meets the existential criteria
[09:03:02] <causative_> well, what universe *doesn't* meet it?
[09:03:08] <ldlework> well that's your larger point
[09:03:19] <ldlework> Aquina's point doesn't supercede yours, it d epends on it
[09:04:17] *** Joins: shea (~shea@user/shea)
[09:04:33] <causative_> I think his point as you presented it isn't coherent because his idea of a "rational universe" would with a strict reading apply to any possible kind of universe, but I don't think he intended the strict reading because I don't think he would call a completely incomprehensible universe like value(t, x) to be "rational"
[09:04:49] <ldlework> We just addressed this...
[09:05:07] <ldlework> Your bit-field universe is fundamentally determined (as you argue all universes must be) but is maximally epistemologically unavailable
[09:05:20] <ldlework> Which to Aquina's point would be the worst case scenario for humans
[09:05:29] <ldlework> Aquinas demands some epistemological access
[09:05:37] <ldlework> Which demands a requiste of a determined universe
[09:06:01] <ldlework> Aquina's was most certainty speaking epistemologically
[09:06:13] <ldlework> That some things we encounter, are regular enough to come to know
[09:07:40] <causative_> what I think he meant, based on what you said, is that for the agents to make sense of the universe, 1. the universe must be comprehensible to some possible agents, and 2., there must be some of those agents in the universe
[09:08:09] <ldlework> right for the universe to be comprehensible, some parts of it must act "rationally" (regularly) and so the universe cannot be fundamentally whimsical
[09:08:10] <causative_> but condition 1. is different from "act the same way everywhere all the time"
[09:08:21] <causative_> which is essentially meaningless
[09:08:49] <ldlework> causative_: I think you're just pedantically focusing on the fact that Aquinas didn't layout the whole matrix of possibilities including universes where parts are determined while others are whimsical, etc.
[09:09:05] <causative_> that's not what I'm focusing on at all
[09:09:11] <ldlework> He was making a broad point that predictability (and the underlying properties of things which allow for it) is and important bridge to knowledge
[09:10:40] <causative_> yes, and that makes sense, my point is just that "act the same way everywhere all the time" is not a meaningful way to express that sentiment
[09:10:44] <ldlework> Creation has order, because the alternative is madness.

[09:11:12] <Delf> Orderly madness
[09:11:19] <ldlework> so we can move on when you're ready
[09:11:53] <causative_> a way to get at the sensibility of the universe is something more like Kolmogorov complexity
[09:11:59] <causative_> that the universe ought to compress somewhat
[09:12:06] <ldlework> sure
[09:12:50] <causative_> which is to say that it's not enough for the universe to follow some rule - we also ask that it follows a particular *kind* of rule, namely one corresponding to a relatively short computer program
[09:13:12] <ldlework> Even short computer programs can produce noise
[09:13:22] <ldlework> There's generally 4 classes wolfram identified
[09:13:28] <ldlework> one's that clear out
[09:13:28] <causative_> yes I know about that
[09:13:34] <ldlework> ones that regress into a repeating pattern
[09:13:38] <ldlework> ones that go into chaos
[09:13:43] <ldlework> and one's that are juuuuust right
[09:13:45] <ldlework> :P
[09:13:51] <causative_> it's apparent noise but it compresses very well
[09:14:05] <mannequin> good morning
[09:14:06] <causative_> so that an agent with access to that rule could predict what's happening next
[09:14:07] <ldlework> it's a spectrum rather than 4 buckets
[09:14:10] <mannequin> Deus vult
[09:14:53] <causative_> but wrt Kolmogorov complexity, we privilege this particular *kind* of rule - short computer programs - because it's the kind of rule we can actually build, the kind of agents we have practical access to
[09:15:10] <ldlework> sure we don't have computers 99% of the unvierse, or unlimited time, etc
[09:15:25] <ldlework> small meat abacuses
[09:15:29] <ldlework> will have to do
[09:15:42] <causative_> so for the universe to have low Kolmogorov complexity would simply be another way of saying that we want the universe to be something understandable by the agents we can build
[09:16:00] <ldlework> you might frame it as
[09:16:02] <causative_> which generalizes to other notions of comprehensibility other than Kolmogorov complexity
[09:16:14] <ldlework> "understandable by agents we can embed into the system with measured complexity"
[09:16:44] <causative_> well, you can't measure the complexity before you've built the agents - the agents are what measure the complexity
[09:16:54] <ldlework> that's not the point
[09:17:05] <ldlework> i'm saying you got some system with some amount of compressibility (knowable or not)
[09:17:21] <ldlework> we care about agents, who we can embed into that very system
[09:17:28] <ldlework> as a better way of saying "agents we can build"
[09:18:22] <causative_> although there is the problem of what it means to embed an agent into a system
[09:18:25] <ldlework> all the difficulties regarding the epistemolgoical prowess of agents, comes from the nature of the epistemological access of sub-systems to the whole
[09:18:43] <causative_> true
[09:19:00] <causative_> Wolfram doesn't have any smart ideas on formally specifying what it means to embed an agent into a system, does he?
[09:19:41] <ldlework> they spend a huge amount of time directly addressing the point that all these philosophical and physics questions we ask have to be continuously qualified that we're talking about one part of the system "knowing" about another part, or the whole
[09:19:50] <causative_> that's a problem I've worked on some
[09:20:12] <causative_> I haven't yet come up with something fully general that satisfies me
[09:20:40] <ldlework> you already know what i'll recommend
[09:20:49] <causative_> has Wolfram formally specified what an agent is?
[09:21:18] <ldlework> i don't think they really think in terms of agents and more about sub-systems and their computational properties

[09:21:55] <ldlework> the question is vague, there is probably no paper titled "The formal properties of subsystems." no

[09:22:49] <ldlework> rather than consume the massive multidiscplinary work that works within the domain of the problem you care about

[09:31:27] <Delf> This is it
[09:31:36] <causative_> something like a homomorphism between the embedded system and the larger system
[09:31:52] <Delf> That's not restricted enough :P

[16:05:48] <arryana> how's you!
[16:06:04] <RFIDtag> doing pretty well, can't complain. And you?
[16:06:35] * arryana smiles
[16:06:56] <arryana> trying to learn tunisian crochet, other half gave me a beautiful set of hooks for christmas
[16:07:23] <RFIDtag> ooh...my wife crochets, and knits. All types/styles. I bet she could help!
[16:07:54] <arryana> i may very well need it, thank you
[16:08:08] <arryana> so far i've managed to cast on and do the first row, from youtube
[16:08:28] <RFIDtag> haha. I will be sure to let her know. :-) I'm still trying to get her interested in the whole IRC thing
[16:09:01] * arryana smiles
[16:09:15] <arryana> she's probably better off with yarn
[16:09:20] <arryana> shame on me
[16:09:40] <arryana> this seems to be a mix between crochet and knitting, and so far i find it marvelous
[16:09:50] <arryana> though i don't think i'd have done well learning it before i could knit or crochet
[16:10:47] <arryana> kind of like the old joke answer to people asking directions, 'well, i wouldn't start from -here-...'
[16:11:14] <RFIDtag> she bought this yarn advent calendar thing...24 different skeins of yarn, dyed in a series of colors. She had no idea what to do with it, so she decided to make a blanket of granny squares. I hope I got all that right, I've not been been keeping up on all the lingo.
[16:11:33] <arryana> oooh
[16:11:36] <arryana> yes, and that'a lovely idea
[16:11:51] <RFIDtag> from what I can see so far, it's going to look fantastic
[16:12:19] <arryana> i have a nearly-finished granny square blanket in the craft room, it was stored while we moved and i haven't gotten it up the list of things to do to finish it
[16:13:28] <RFIDtag> she made one years ago, and we still use it on the sofa. It's gorgeous! She is so talented, way more talented than I'll ever be when it comes to arts & crafts.
[16:15:13] <arryana> i have no doubt that her stuff is -way- better than mine
[16:15:19] * arryana is still a relative newbie
