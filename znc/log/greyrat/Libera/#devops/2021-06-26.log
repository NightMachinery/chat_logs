[02:22:40] <rawtaz> general poll: what's the latest thing/software/tool you used that made you go "wow, that's really cool"?
[02:31:49] <kubblai> nb
[02:32:19] <kubblai> rawtaz: https://github.com/xwmx/nb
[02:32:30] * rawtaz clicks to be amazed
[02:34:29] <rawtaz> interesting
[02:34:35] <kubblai> i dunno if its a devops tool but i love it and have been using it loads. if you init the notebook in a git repo it'll auto add commit push whenever you close your note in vim
[02:35:47] <kubblai> i havent worked out how to use the encryption yet tho
[02:35:59] <themachine> I'm currently working on wrapping my head around cloud-init
[02:36:09] <themachine> which is pretty interesting
[02:36:24] <themachine> though I don't think I ever though it was "cool"
[02:36:37] <kubblai> another cool tool is is-website-vulnerable uses snyk's db to scan websites for out of date js libs
[02:37:27] <rawtaz> kubblai: looking through the usage overview it seems very flexible. i think theres some mental hurdle to get past the "why bother instead of just e.g. `vi ~/mynote.txt` though. like with tmux vs screen :)
[02:37:45] <rawtaz> oh thats a good one too
[02:38:06] <rawtaz> themachine: you'll be rather cool when you did it though
[02:39:16] <kubblai> wuzz is also nice for interactive curling
[02:40:16] <kubblai> rawtaz: its better than simply hosting a file since its in git
[02:40:43] <themachine> I'm in the middle of creating my own git back notes setup
[02:40:44] <kubblai> you can even branch notebooks if thats what you want
[02:41:27] <themachine> started using gitjournal on my phone so I'm writing a bash script to work along with that on my work machine
[02:41:57] <kubblai> nice themachine link us your repo when your done :P
[02:42:18] <themachine> heh, will do
[02:42:20] <kubblai> just so we can poke holes in your code ofc :D
[02:42:32] <themachine> I think it's going to be much simpler than what nb appears to be
[02:42:56] <themachine> but it'll work how I want it to which is all that matters of course
[02:43:18] <rawtaz> its funny how we all have our different use cases. personally i never need to have my notes anywhere but on my laptop, so just having them there and using proper backups to make sure i dont lose them is perfect for me
[02:44:01] <kubblai> rawtaz: each to their own i guess, im definitely happy my wife prefers me over some other guy :)
[02:44:10] <rawtaz> :DD
[02:44:26] <rawtaz> thats what matters isnt it
[02:44:39] <themachine> I use my "notes" as sort of a dump for general stuff too. I can start on a grocery list on my phone, finish it on my laptop later, and then see it on my phone again when I'm actually shopping
[02:44:44] <kubblai> i found a nice dig alternative the other day that supports dns over https requesting its called dog
[02:44:56] <rawtaz> awesome name!
[02:45:00] <themachine> things like that are why I like it on my phone too
[02:46:36] <kubblai> any of you use asdf ?
[02:47:06] <themachine> never heard of it
[02:47:59] <kubblai> i use it mainly for managing terraform versioning when working on different projects that req different versions you dump a .tool-versions file in the base of your repo with the tf version inside and asdf handles it
[02:48:19] <kubblai> you can version most stuff with it with the correct plugin 
[02:53:50] <rawtaz> i never use it
[02:54:52] <kubblai> wishing you hadnt asked now rawtaz :)
[02:55:05] <rawtaz> haha
[02:55:36] <rawtaz> i dont even know what id answer myself..
[02:58:55] <McBird> problem with that nb thing
[02:59:02] <McBird> i am shit at writing docs in the first place
[03:00:28] <kubblai> well i just use it for notes, granted in markdown but then they look pwitty
[03:00:50] <McBird> i lowkey really enjoy onenote for notes
[03:01:06] <kubblai> dont tell anyone but i agree
[03:02:09] <kubblai> only issue i have with is sometimes the syncing is a bit dodgy
[03:02:30] <kubblai> but the interface is gorgeous
[03:03:06] <McBird> yeah
[03:03:19] <McBird> and honestly i just love being able to move my text entries
[03:03:34] <McBird> i can organize and change things around pretty easily
[03:04:16] <kubblai> cmon are you saying vim isnt intuitive :)
[03:05:09] <kubblai> are you forced to host onenote files in onedrive McBird 
[03:05:16] <McBird> given i didn't even know about vimrcs till like 1 year after i knew of vim
[03:05:31] <McBird> idk, company uses MS office so i just use whatever they give me lol
[03:06:02] <McBird> so no?
[03:06:08] <kubblai> heh
[03:06:19] <kubblai> i actually like the web version too
[03:06:58] <McBird> can't say i've used it. Just the outlook mail version
[03:10:52] <rawtaz> on a different topic, here's an interesting paper: https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2021/papers/hotos21-s01-hochschild.pdf
[03:14:31] <kubblai> im not ready for bed yet rawtaz !!
[03:14:47] <rawtaz> :)
