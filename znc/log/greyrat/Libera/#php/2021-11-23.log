[00:08:50] <bytestream> is there an archive of all chat in here?
[00:14:03] <da_wunder> maybe if someone has logged all messages
[00:15:40] <AllenJB> As far as I know there's no public archive created by either the channel mods or the network. It's not entirely improbable that some entity is publishing logs for this channel somewhere on the internet - your best bet of finding those, if they exist, is probably Google.

[03:34:02] <Blondie101010> bytestream:  it's really hard to imagine that you'd have such long running processes that don't log where they are, which should answer your question...  you could look at `lsof -p 26538` and /proc/26538/fd
[03:34:34] <bytestream> both of those are shown in the gist, it's a imaps socket which appears to be stuck
[03:36:55] <Blondie101010> does your process continue where it left off when you restart it?  I suppose it must process a message and do something to it which would be trackable or stop it from being reprocessed, right?

[13:27:52] <Koopz> i recently fired up an openvscode-server in a docker container which obviously doesn't have a php executable and only my project files mapped into it. I setup a launch.json contain the proxy info and started the dbgproxy tool on the host system, making sure it listens to the local network and... according to the output VS Code managed to connect to
[13:27:52] <Koopz> it... but what do i do on the server side now?
[13:28:59] <Koopz> do i need to configure my host's xdebug.ini to connect to 127.0.0.1:9000?
[13:30:39] <Koopz> this is what's supposed to happen right? my browser sends a request to php-fpm, php-fpm connects to the "server server" of dbgproxy which in turn forwards the data to the client connected on the "client server"
[13:31:50] <Naktibalda> with xdebug is a bit confusing what is client and what is server
[13:33:05] <Naktibalda> xdebug on php-fpm side is the client and it connects to the server which is running on your computer usually, I have no idea how does that proxy work

[13:33:16] <Koopz> i currently have xdebug.discover_client_host=true with no xdebug.client_host as fallback defined
[13:34:02] <Koopz> i suppose i should try setting client_host to localhost and client_port to 9000 and see what happens
[13:34:32] <Naktibalda> In the following example, we start a proxy that listens for debugger connections on the loopback address 127.0.0.1 and port 9001, and listens for developers on the machine IP address and port 9000.
[13:35:07] <Naktibalda> if proxy runs on the server, then you must configure xdebug to connect to 127.0.0.1

[13:38:25] <Koopz> the default for the port in the launch.json seems to be 9001 though
[13:38:59] <Naktibalda> Does VS Code support DBG Proxy?

[18:10:57] <skyroveRR> I'm setting up an online dig utility wherein part of the form accepts both, hostname and an IP address. I'd like to validate either of them. Does FILTER_VALIDATE_DOMAIN cover both, the hostname and the IP address or just the hostname? Would I need FILTER_VALIDATE_IP separately?
[18:21:34] <AllenJB> FILTER_VALIDATE_DOMAIN will only check "label lengths" by default, which probably isn't what you want (see my example that lets control characters through).
[18:21:35] <AllenJB> You'll probably want the FLAG_HOSTNAME option too. You'll want to validate IPs separately for IPv6 support and options for filtering private ranges: https://3v4l.org/5lIsO
[18:21:43] <TinoDidriksen> As with the other validators, it seems pretty worthless.
[18:22:44] <AllenJB> Aside: I have no idea what IDN support on FILTER_VALIDATE_DOMAIN is like.
[18:23:20] <TinoDidriksen> It doesn't reject them, at least.
[18:23:35] <TinoDidriksen> But given that it lets through invalid domains, that doesn't say much.

[18:31:17] <skyroveRR> AllenJB: Thank you for the pastebin! Seems like FILTER_VALIDATE_DOMAIN, if FILTER_FLAG_HOSTNAME is passed, validates only hostnames and not IP addresses. I provide a list of DNS record types in my web application form, which includes "A" and "PTR". And also in the form, I provide a text input for hostname/IP. I think I should do an IP validation only when the PTR record is selected. For A/AAAA records, this
[18:31:19] <skyroveRR> FILTER_VALIDATE_DOMAIN,FILTER_FLAG_HOSTNAME will do.

[23:51:29] <novns> no, that would be illegal
[23:51:52] <novns> <AllenJB> You should only ever get that message from mod_php, not PHP-FPM. My recommended solution: Switch fully to PHP-FPM and disable mod_php
[23:51:53] <novns> <novns> or just stick to mod_php and mpm_prefork
[23:51:53] <novns> <novns> or try nginx instead, apache is too fat for alpine
[23:52:27] <novns> the-count, here are some of advices
[23:52:45] <Sammitch> OR
[23:52:56] <Sammitch> switch to a base container image that already has FPM set up properly
