[11:13:21] <onizu> Is it better to create a new object (of a different class, but required) inside a class or to provide it as an argument?
[11:25:42] <Naktibalda> argument is better
[11:25:45] <onizu> secondly, if a class2 extends class1, to create class2 object, we need to provide class1's constructor arguments. If we already have an object of class1, can it be used directly instead of providing the arguments while creating the class2 object?
[11:25:58] <onizu> Naktibalda: ok
[11:27:35] <Naktibalda> second case looks like misuse of inheritance

[11:32:53] <onizu> i see

[11:36:44] <Naktibalda> onizu: inheritance makes sense when the child class is a subtype of parent class, but it does something differently from other subtypes.
[11:38:42] <onizu> ok, consider class1 is a Table (db) and class2 is a Row , so should it be a child of class1 or take class1 as a parameter? (I need class2 (Row) to always have the information of the table it belongs to)
[11:41:12] <Naktibalda> Row is not a table, so it should not inherit Table class
[11:44:22] <onizu> ok
[11:45:56] <onizu> so a parent class is more generic and a child class is a more specific form of its parent

[12:17:59] <biberu> onizu: a common way to present is whether it is a has-a or an is-a relationship, e.g. a table might *have* rows, but it a row *is not* a table. if you have cyclical dependencies between e.g rows and tables there might be another way to structure it, perhaps you need another type or can provide the data the row needs in some other way

[12:22:15] <onizu> biberu: can you give an example for "... need another type"
[12:22:40] <biberu> onizu: and if you should provide something as an argument or not depends more on how you use it than what it is: there are classes that are fine to create on the fly, e.g. dtos or various values, and there are things other than classes that you might want to parameterize (e.g. functions)
[12:25:15] <biberu> onizu: it depends on what they need from each other and how you want to use the final interface (as in the interface to your entire hierarchy, not an "interface"). perhaps you could refactor table so that whatever rows need is separate? perhaps you can access rows only through table and provide the information that way? etc etc
[12:27:02] <onizu> biberu: 'access rows only through table' means?
[12:27:15] <onizu> biberu: you mean make rows a property of table?
[12:28:29] <onizu> biberu: and all that rows need from the table is the ID, so it would also suffice to do: $row = new Row($table->getId());
[12:28:44] <onizu> biberu: anyway this is a hypothetical example

[12:37:56] <onizu> i mean this requirement would arise is many more classes in the system, and having new classes just to share some info between classes, could lead to a large number of classes to manage? (or maybe not.. haven't been in that scenario :) ..just thinking)
[12:38:32] <onizu> but I get what you meant there - to create a small class for sharing info 
[12:39:30] <biberu> sure, there could be more classes, but they should structure your code so that it's easier to work with on the whole, if they aren't doing that, well, refactor ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[12:39:41] <onizu> btw, the reason to pass the tableID to the row object is just to avoid the creation of any orphan row
[12:40:06] <biberu> orphan as in does not belong to a table? why is that a problem?
[12:40:21] <onizu> coz that's wrong
[12:40:47] <onizu> if there's a row, it must belong to a table.. it can't exist without a table.. 
[12:40:53] <biberu> why?
[12:41:12] <biberu> in a list of numbers, couldn't the numbers exist independently of the list?
[12:41:18] <onizu> lets just say for this case that that's how it is..
[12:42:18] <biberu> not going to say that :D
[12:42:31] <onizu> so maybe in such a case the row should be a property of Table? (but then I want the row to have its own set of properties, and want to perform operations on it)
[12:42:38] <onizu> biberu: hehe :)
[12:42:48] <onizu> ok so maybe I chose a wrong analogy 
[12:43:47] <onizu> like if there's a fruit, it must have come some parent plant
[12:44:08] <onizu> and for each fruit, I need it to have the ID of its parent plant, that's all

[13:08:11] <TinoDidriksen> I've never seen the point of phar. Never seen it used in production. It's superfluous, and as such should be disabled.

[17:18:45] <Blondie101010> Gargoyle:  the only way this problem could be happening inside the process is if you have badly broken libs on your system
[17:19:09] <Blondie101010> so unless you use a really unreliable OS, that is extremely unlikely
[17:21:06] <Blondie101010> a possibility could be that your DNS resolver fails and is set to do negative caching (usually a bad idea)
[17:22:08] <Gargoyle> It's a standard Ubuntu install. This morning I caught the php process miss-behaving in our elastic search logs, and while it was complaining with errors about couldn't resolve example.com, from the command line I could successfully run resolvectrl query example.com (Obviously example.com is not the real address in question)
[17:23:01] <Gargoyle> After restarting the service, it plays ball for a few days without a single error. Then after about 4-5 days, it starts failing to resolve again.
[17:23:05] <Blondie101010> hmmm, you should ask your sysadmin...  Linux/*nix can deal with DNS in different ways
[17:23:18] <Gargoyle> I am the sys admin! :D
[17:23:25] <entuland> ehehehe
[17:23:27] <Blondie101010> then ask to be replaced
[17:23:45] <Blondie101010> read on nsswitch to learn a bit on how it works
[17:24:26] <Blondie101010> and also consult the utility's man page because it can do whatever it was coded to do, not what your PHP script does

[20:24:59] <cferry> I'd like to automatically include all files in src/Commands
[20:25:04] <cferry> I've just added to autoload:   "autoload": {
[20:25:04] <cferry>   
[20:25:04] <cferry>    "Beryl\\Commands\\": "src/Commands/",

[20:25:34] <__adrian> cferry: please use a paste site for code
[20:25:44] <__adrian> did you see Naktibalda's lin above?
[20:25:46] <__adrian> *link
[20:25:48] <Naktibalda> alright, so you don't want to include all files every time, but you want to make all commands work, right?
[20:26:03] <cferry> it's down
[20:26:06] <cferry> I couldn't use hashphp
[20:26:09] <cferry> so don't be mean
[20:26:28] <__adrian> https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#files  this one (it's not down)
[20:26:34] <__adrian> and i'm not being mean  :)
[20:26:34] <Naktibalda> if we forget that you asked to include all files, what issue did you have with psr-4 autoloading?
[20:27:26] <__adrian> looking at your paste... in php, `use` creates aliases. it _does not_ "import" any code or class definitions, if that's what you're expecting.
[20:27:44] <__adrian> did you require composer's autoloader? autoloading doesn't work if you don't do so.
[20:27:50] <cferry> adrian, it'd be great if I can use all files in a dir
[20:28:00] <cferry> yes
[20:28:15] <cferry> require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';
[20:28:22] <__adrian> if by "use" you mean "alias" and "directory" you mean "namespace," yes, you can do that
[20:28:30] <__adrian> i don't advise it, but it's possible
[20:28:42] <cferry> any idea how?
[20:28:55] <__adrian> use Your\Name\Space;
[20:28:56] <cferry> like: use Beryl\Commands\*
[20:29:03] <__adrian> no *
[20:29:07] <Naktibalda> definitelly an X-Y issue, you are asking about non-issue
[20:29:26] <__adrian> that namespace path would then be available in your script as  Space
[20:29:31] <Naktibalda> show the code which is using these classes and what error you get
[20:29:34] <__adrian> so  Space\Foo  or  Space\bar, etc

[20:30:56] <Naktibalda> cferry: have you got Beryl namespace setup in psr-4 section of composer.json?
[20:31:18] <cferry>    "Beryl\\Commands\\": "src/Commands/",
[20:31:20] <cferry> like that?
[20:31:44] <__adrian> (most likely) yes, looks correct
[20:31:51] <__adrian> i think the issue here is expectations
[20:31:59] <Naktibalda> you have LGet.php, Move.php and so on in that dir?
[20:32:07] <__adrian> as i said above, `use` only aliases, it does not "import" code or class definitions
[20:32:07] <cferry> still not found
[20:32:11] <cferry> yes.. 100% certain
[20:32:38] <__adrian> can you share the `use` line(s) in question, and the line that causes that error?
[20:33:04] <Naktibalda> could you show full autoload section of your composer.json ?

[23:26:44] <TinoDidriksen> You manage to saturate 32k ports?
[23:27:27] <TinoDidriksen> If you really want all clients to use the socket, you can just disable listening on TCP.
