[00:17:39] <nativetexan> dr pepper is my favorite coke
[00:17:52] <riff-IRC> tore down my main computer setup Monday evening, put up some new lights in my room yesterday, put everything back together today
[00:18:12] <riff-IRC> also changed a few thins
[00:18:15] <riff-IRC> also changed a few things
[00:18:19] <nativetexan> tore it down and cleaned it
[00:18:25] <nativetexan> i hope
[00:18:38] <riff-IRC> also did some dusting
[00:18:39] <Panther> Each break is different... they are ar :18 and :48 The first is a welcome break for 30-40 seconds, the :48 is a PSA, the second :18 is a 'personality break', where I say interesting things about me, or tell jpkes.. this can be up to 60 seconds.. then the last :48 is a farewell enf of show thing.
[00:18:48] <nativetexan> i may need to clean mine actually, i haven't checked in a few weeks
[00:19:08] <riff-IRC> I replaced a 10ft extension cord (powering one thing) with a custom-length 2ft cord
[00:19:20] <nativetexan> that's cool Panther
[00:19:36] <riff-IRC> also replaced some super-crappy speaker wire with some actually good RadioShack stuff from the 90s
[00:19:49] <nativetexan> but, i'm chillin' right now so the dust in the pc wouldn't bother me

[00:20:35] <Panther> So, there is a music playlist, and at :18 and :48, the engineer sticks the .mp3s I send him into the appropriate places. Basically, during a 2 hour show, I am talking for at most 3 minutes during these 'breaks.'
[00:21:15] <nativetexan> any ideas on what you're going to say yet?
[00:21:23] <Panther> He also suggested doing my uni show in that format.
[00:21:41] <Panther> I have the playlist, so I am gonna work with that. :)
[00:21:43] <nativetexan> ah yeah, get some practice in
[00:22:13] <Panther> I do kinda have to introduce it, tho, and it begins at 1.
[00:22:26] <riff-IRC> man, I thought I had stereo separation earlier, I clearly hadn't heard true stereo separation
[00:22:41] <nativetexan> welcome to the party riff-IRC
[00:22:48] <riff-IRC> thx
[00:23:15] <Panther> Still, even you have said you wished I would say more, so mebbe I can break it up with a 30 second spot.

[02:20:46] <LibertyDillo> We just caught the edge of it here, and the winds were still bending over live oaks like willows

[02:21:32] <LibertyDillo> although they said Houston had some serious drainage issues

[05:05:47] <artao> yikes. no
[05:05:50] <artao> not in water
[05:05:58] <artao> soak it in isopropyl
[05:06:01] <Panther> You just add 1-3 drops to 1g of whatever you have set up to vape.. I did it with d-8.
[05:06:03] <nativetexan> how do you get the oil, squeeze it?
[05:06:18] <nativetexan> alcohol?
[05:06:23] <Panther> They extract it in a lot of ways
[05:06:26] <Panther> Butane is one
[05:06:31] <Panther> CO2
[05:06:31] <artao> you can press it, but otherwise yes. alcohol
[05:06:43] <artao> or butane
[05:06:51] <artao> what he said ^^
[05:07:00] <nativetexan> butane extracts oils?  
[05:07:10] <artao> i bet acetone would too
[05:07:15] <Panther> Butane is an oil.
[05:07:21] <artao> but then it's harder to get rid of
[05:07:22] <LibertyDillo> Panther wants a vacation << Avoid Cancun.  What was once a beautiful tourist resort is become a battleground for drug cartels competing to supply drugs to the tourists.  There was even an incident with a cartel fight with guys on jet skis shooting at rivals on the beach :/
[05:07:27] <Panther> Essentially.. it is a 4 carbon alkane.
[05:07:32] <artao> isopropyl is easy. it just evaporates, nice and clean
[05:07:47] <LibertyDillo> Used to be a nice place.  My family had a time share condo there in the 80s
[05:08:02] <LibertyDillo> We visited the Mayan ruins and all that
[05:08:15] <artao> i'd want to sleep in them

[19:13:49] <Panther> Be forewarned. Former landlord here. Don’t do it! If you provide fire extinguishers, you also must provide proper safety training to each tenant on how to use them! Then they have to replaced or recharged every 2 years or so. Was bringing a 6 family up to code 3 years ago & the fire marshal literally advised me against it for those reasons.
[19:14:23] <Panther> Now, that makes REAL sense... for God's sake, let them burn before lifting a finger to teach them how to save their, and everyone else's lives.

[21:38:54] <artao> dafuq
[21:39:02] <murthy> :D
[21:39:13] <artao> racists
[21:39:59] <SummerSkies> fuck you
[21:40:18] <murthy> SummerSkies: sounds like 80's blues
[21:40:38] <SummerSkies> it doesn't sound like a style to me
[21:40:43] <SummerSkies> the sound of this is not what I'm working on
[21:40:57] <murthy> SummerSkies: oh you millennial
[21:40:57] <SummerSkies> i just chose choir voices for the notes and astring ensemble for the bass
[21:41:01] <SummerSkies> no production whatsoever
[21:41:10] <SummerSkies> all I'm doing is playing with notes
[21:41:20] <murthy> 80's blues was like that
[21:41:21] <SummerSkies> music structure and composition, not production or aesthetics
[21:41:30] <murthy> ya
[21:41:43] <morf> it sounds nice :) 
[21:41:47] <murthy> FreeRangeDillo: You want the morlog logs?
[21:41:51] <SummerSkies> are the transitions smooth
[21:41:52] <morf> don't murthy SummerSkies 
[21:42:04] <SummerSkies> all i care about is if the music transitions sounds natural
[21:42:10] <morf> it does
[21:42:14] <SummerSkies> it means nothing to me if this thing 'sounds cool'
[21:42:18] <SummerSkies> it aint meant to 
[21:42:32] <SummerSkies> i just wouldn't really be able to work on it if i was using synthesizers that didn't sound appealing in some type of way 
[21:42:37] <FreeRangeDillo> No that's OK murthy.  I've messaged him and asked him how he's doing.  Thanks anyway...
[21:42:42] <morf> it sounds like garbage but the transition was nice 
[21:42:46] <SummerSkies> lol 
[21:42:57] <SummerSkies> morf: just the answer i was looking for
[21:43:05] <morf> i know 
[21:43:11] <morf> ;) 
[21:43:55] <murthy> SummerSkies: I am trying to remember a song like this
[21:44:14] <murthy> SummerSkies: no issues with transition
[21:44:34] <murthy> FreeRangeDillo: You don't know what happened?

[21:53:13] <morf> yeah well 
[21:53:20] <morf> he will be ok 
[21:53:30] <morf> he's just bit funny in the head, and has hard life
[21:53:48] <morf> so he might be putting it on other ppl 
[21:53:49] <murthy> but seriously speaking I think he is tired of charging his mobile and stuff
