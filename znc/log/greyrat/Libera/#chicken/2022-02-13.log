[00:14:33] <Zipheir> Looks like the posix-group egg has an incorrect type: group-information is declared fixnum -> *, but it accepts strings, too.

[00:37:49] <dieggsy> so i think it might be
[00:37:52] <dieggsy> I can get around it by eval-ing the import i suppose
[00:38:07] <dieggsy> i'm bassically just looking for some code that does 'hey if this module exists, import it and execute this code, otherwise warn but continue'. i think i've got something working but it's a bit ugly
[00:38:51] <wasamasa> the openssl egg has a "dynamic" import
[00:42:41] <siiky> dieggsy: oh that's... peculiar lol (the error type)
[00:44:39] <dieggsy> wasamasa: huh, what does that mean
[00:47:00] <dieggsy> i suppose i could just straight up check if the name exists in repository-path
[00:49:32] <dieggsy> nah, that's complicated cause i'd have to handle special import syntax and such

[02:10:18] <dieggsy> as in, the functions i need (let or no, just tested) are the problem in that i get unbound errors. .....i'm assuming this is something about.  the eval hasn't happened yet when the interpreter is checking if the functions exist. idk
