[04:16:40] <Guest76> Yes!
[04:16:46] <BSaboia> From man bash : If a command is terminated by the control operator &, the shell executes the command in the background in a subshell.
[04:17:04] <Guest76> set -o vi fixes it. Not sure why that is causing the menu-complete-backward binding

[04:17:26] <Blondie101010> BSaboia: but that doesn't define the current point
[04:17:30] <Sauvin> I don't normally, either, but it IS sometimes galling when people who very clearly don't know their asses from their elbows argue with such a body of experience.
[04:17:39] <Blondie101010> it is used as a command separator too
[04:17:47] <Blondie101010> like ;
[04:17:58] <Guest8463> I won't try any variant of any command, I just recommend clarification
[04:17:59] <Sauvin> The difference is, & does more than just separate.
[04:18:15] <keir> precisely
[04:18:21] <kurahaupo> Nobody claimed that '&' and ';' have the same effect. The assertion is that they have the same grammatical function, which the quote by BSaboia confirms
[04:18:21] <Sauvin> ; is explicitly just a separator.

[08:18:14] <jim> by that time, debian had grown into having the ability to build itself, and also populate the package archives... all that's needed is the technical maintainance of the packages

I'm not that experienced with iptables. I need to forward UDP 19132 to TCP 32323. Might someone be able to guide me or link me a helpful resource?

[12:52:44] <Repox> Well, if I can't use iptables, it makes sense why my Google-fu isn't returning anything useful. I'm trying to setup a minecraft server with GeyserMC that should support UDP connections for pocket/bedrock editions, so mo kids can play minecraft together. But I can't connect from the outside to the UDP port for some reason.
[12:53:09] <Repox> I thought I needed to forward something as stated in https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/wiki/Setup#port-forwarding
[12:53:51] <Repox> But maybe I'm just missing something with the configuration.

[14:12:40] <hodapp> the bridge isn't running DHCP; the DHCP request that's made is done by whoever connects to it and it's passed along to whatever's on the other side. so, the bridge itself doesn't receive that IP - any more than a switch receives an IP address because a device on it sends a DHCP request.

[14:14:16] <hodapp> but they often still require a way to access their settings - so the bridge will also sit on some static IP like 192.168.0.1 to answer HTTP/telnet/whatever

[14:16:09] <hexnewbie> Did you run du on the root of the fs, without wildcards, nested mounts or the like?

[16:13:29] <hexnewbie> fdan: Also possibly compression, though this should only affect 'du' if you uses --apparent-size with it, or if the filesystem stat() reporting is broken for compressed files. Dedup and bind mounts can  lead to the inverse situation (reporting data of *more* than 100% of the used space/filesystem)

[17:00:47] <hexnewbie> pikapika: To be fair, if *had* asked how to get bytes transferred per connection (or process), I would have told you there was no way to do it, since I've had trouble getting that information myself and I am unsure where ss gets it from)
[17:01:12] <pikapika> I have no need for a per process table
[17:01:19] <pikapika> Cumulative stats for the whole system is what I need
[17:01:27] <pikapika> Yeah its confusing
[17:01:44] <pikapika> hexnewbie, so the thing that motivated it all is

[17:02:03] <pikapika> that tool seems to read from /proc/net/dev

[17:09:58] <hexnewbie> For a Linux monitoring tool that uses /proc/net/dev, I've made a cross-platform drop-in replacement that works on at least Linux and Windows: python3 -c 'import psutil, json; print(json.dumps(psutil.net_io_counters(pernic=True)))'
[17:10:16] <pikapika> is psutil a standard python library

[17:11:49] <hexnewbie> No. I wrote another (private) tool that used /proc/net/dev, which I switched to use psutil.net_io_counters() - optionally - so it would work on Windows
[17:12:19] <pikapika> Oh I see
[17:12:24] <hexnewbie> psutil seems to have Linux, Windows, BSD, AIX, macOS and Solaris support
[17:12:25] <pikapika> anyways this psutil library seems cross platform
[17:12:32] <pikapika> let me see if it supports this operation on freebsd as well
[17:12:56] <pikapika> there does seem to exist a port for it

[23:45:54] <Gustavo6046> Puzzling how Linux works super well for some people, and super not-well for others (the latter even including very respected devs such as from the Doom sourceport community).
[23:45:58] <Gustavo6046> Maybe it's all about distros?
[23:46:15] <zfiz> akoana: yah it does
[23:46:18] <Gustavo6046> Could the pervasiveness of Ubuntu play a role here?
[23:46:23] <zfiz> akoana: it works when booting etc
[23:46:37] <zfiz> akoana: just whenever the xsession / gnome needs to restart does it not start.

[23:52:23] <zfiz> it's not a huge issue as the script typically runs, but every so often after an update or something, my xsession will reload or gnome restarts or whatever and the script isn't getting run
[23:52:28] <zfiz> was hoping to find a way around that

[23:57:49] <coder7of9> myisp support tells me:  servers are all in different subnets, they will pass through a common router/L3 switch shared with all the clients here. Considering that the traffic between your servers should not even cross devices outside of the DC network, we should be expecting a smooth flow of data between them.
