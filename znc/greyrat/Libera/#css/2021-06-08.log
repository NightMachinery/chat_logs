[00:11:27] <peteyboy1> simplest way of making an element (that is longer than the screen) to finish at the very most at the bottom of the visible screen?
[00:19:21] <entuland> peteyboy1, will there be something more under that element?
[00:20:03] <entuland> if the element takes more than the available space you either have to clip its contents or add a scrollbar, but I'm not sure I fully get your scenario
[00:20:55] <peteyboy1> entuland, there won't be anything more, but the element might be shorter than the screen's height depending on the amount of content
[00:21:24] <peteyboy1> and yeah, overflow auto is already set, now i just need to make the element no longer than the rest of the page
[00:21:39] <entuland> probably the easiest solution is to use a grid layout for your main containers
[00:22:02] <entuland> something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/1at5xzkh/
[00:23:54] <entuland> alternatives are placing your containers as fixed and / or giving it a specific height based on the viewport (vh units) and the alike
[00:24:16] <entuland> providing the live page or a fiddle may help understanding your situation better
[00:31:54] <peteyboy1> ok yeah i see what you did with the grid

[01:50:25] <poiqwepoiqwe> youtube_iframe_selector{border: 1px solid #000000} . So we have a solid border attached to the iframe object. I was thinking gradients and blur but thought there must be a simpler way to achieve.
[02:01:19] <entuland> poiqwepoiqwe, what is it that you're trying to achieve?
[02:02:24] <poiqwepoiqwe> entuland iframe with a black border the feathers / gradients out to the white background
[02:03:11] <entuland> you're halfway there - you can add box-shadow to achieve the gradient outside
[02:05:10] <poiqwepoiqwe> yeah got it i think
[02:06:00] <entuland> you can also have multiple shadows on a single element
[02:13:33] <entuland> although for a single color it's enough to use the spread radius

[06:32:20] <FunkyBob> o/
[06:41:37] <kevr> Is there a way to use justified text, but justifying in the center? I'm trying `text-align: justify; justify-content: center;` but it doesn't seem to put anything in the center that doesn't full up the width of the container
[06:41:54] <kevr> s/full/fill/
[06:48:29] <FunkyBob> from memory, isn't justify-content only for flex?
[06:52:17] <kevr> FunkyBob: Yeah, I think you are right.
[06:55:03] <FunkyBob> justify should make all the text edges even... if you then want to center that _block_, margin: 0 auto; on the container
[07:11:43] <kevr> FunkyBob: I want it justified, but also centered where there is not enough text to fill up the space.
[07:11:53] <kevr> if there's extra space that it cant handle, it just looks left-align justified.
[07:11:54] <FunkyBob> ah
[07:11:59] <FunkyBob> so orhpan lines to be centered
[07:12:03] <kevr> right
[07:14:10] <FunkyBob> i don't bleieve there's a way in css

[13:50:23] <dev4449> Is my understanding correct: `em` is relative to the font-size of it's direct or nearest parent, which means if it's direct parent has a font-size CSS property, it will depend on that property. if not, the dom is traversed up to it's indirect parent elements until an element with a font-size property is found.
[13:51:33] <dev4449> The parents are checked one-by-one until one that has font-size is found.

[23:59:21] <kek_> hi, so I just read about changin sass variables for bulma when using nuxt with buefy and apparently, you have to first define the vars and then import buefs and bulmy. see https://github.com/buefy/buefy/issues/319#issuecomment-427642851  but why? doesn't the import overwrite the vars?
