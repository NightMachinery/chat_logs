[11:11:52] <hayley> I didn't really get an answer for inlining, but he says that spilling is more optimized on x86-64 than RISCs, so you can win a lot with callee-saves there.
[11:12:24] <hayley> And he explained why callee-saves is annoying with a GC that scans the stack for pointers, saying "Java HotSpot did it, but it wasn't really worth it for all the very-low-frequency GC bugs that entailed."

[19:26:14] <lotuseater> edgar-rft: we had some days back a discussion about irish "Mc" surnames and such
[19:26:31] <lotuseater> so McOS
[19:26:39] <selwyn> mc is scottish originally iirc
[19:26:44] <selwyn> but of course in ireland
[19:26:46] <selwyn> mcos lol
[19:27:59] <edgar-rft> the gaelic "mac" (as used in scotland and ireland) means "sun of" :-)
[19:28:15] <edgar-rft> bullshit, "son of" :-)
[19:28:39] <selwyn> oh it comes from gaelic
[19:29:00] <selwyn> makes sense

[19:29:44] -ixelp- Paddy Losty - YouTube
[19:29:47] <edgar-rft> but as far as I know the Apple Mac originally was called MacIntosh, the son of Intosh :-)
[19:33:12] <lotuseater> selwyn: sorry!
[19:34:19] <lotuseater> there was Macintosh Common Lisp, or not? what now became Clozure CL (when spoken out it clashes with Clojure)
[19:34:34] <selwyn> yes clozure v clojure much confusion
[19:35:46] *** Quits: zacts (~zacts@user/zacts) (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[19:35:49] <lotuseater> so i could also put part of my CL learn time to Clojure for someday getting a "cool" job
[19:36:27] <selwyn> i also thought of that
[19:36:31] <selwyn> but, idk
[19:36:46] <selwyn> there are surely some clojure jobs but its zeitgeist seems to have passed
[19:36:48] <gilberth> Call Darwin what ever you like, SBCL 2.1.7 does not compile there.
[19:37:01] <lotuseater> ah really? o_O
[19:37:19] <lotuseater> i thought it's the highest paid lang out there
[19:37:36] <gilberth> Yes, and the latest binary release is SBCL 1.something with pretty bad fixnum performance.
[19:37:40] <lotuseater> but this 100k jobs are just for "senior" wrangler
[19:38:01] <lotuseater> oh didn't know 2.1.7 is out
[19:38:16] <selwyn> well, there are probably not many clojure programmers either
[19:38:41] <gilberth> Well, I just download the most recent version. However, 2.0.2 still builds, which should be suffice.
[19:39:01] <lotuseater> yes there aren't and many of also bigger companies seem to use it

[19:41:25] <lotuseater> "zeitgeist" :D one of those wonderful words
[19:41:38] <lotuseater> but I don't see Clojure having a standard
[19:51:08] <lotuseater> or Rust
[19:57:55] <lotuseater> pjb: you wrote in #commonlisp about Smalltalk 72 in Assembler. the first computer algebra system SCHOONSCHIP by Martinus Veltman also was rather than Lisp or Fortran
[20:01:15] <pjb> Of course, a lot of programming was done in assembler before unix established the validity of "higher" level programming languages.
[20:01:47] <pjb> edgar-rft: macOS IS very different from MacOS!
[20:02:56] <lotuseater> he also argumented everywhere using floats is the best, it was more or less special purpose for doing long running and complex particle physics calculations. and got him the nobel prize about 30 years later :D

[20:29:40] <gilberth> It "view source from frame" in Slime supposed to work with SBCL? It takes me to the DEFUN not to the spot where the error occurred.
[20:30:12] <gilberth> And no locals either. Useless!
[20:32:41] <pjb> gilberth: this may depend on the optimization levels. If you compile with (debug 0) (speed 3) (space 3), it may be difficult to pin-point the exact source.
[20:33:24] <gilberth> pjb: Is there (debug 4) or (debug-i-really-need-that 99) ?
[20:33:36] <pjb>  No. 0 1 2 3 are the only values.
[20:33:52] <gilberth> Anyhow, "heap exhausted".
[20:34:11] <pjb> they could have used (none some much full)instead of (0 1 2 3) really…
[20:34:13] <gilberth> pjb: So the spec didn't change over night? Good.
[20:35:50] <ck_> is anyone interested in APL here?
[20:37:32] <gilberth> "Heap exhausted, game over." still. I really love SBCL. Not.
[20:37:50] <lotuseater> ck_: yes
[20:38:28] <lotuseater> gilberth: i tried to load numcl this week but it ran into heap exhaustion
[20:39:39] <ck_> I've last checked a couple of years ago, and now for example Dyalog doesn't require you to go hoop jumping before allowing a download for personal use. It's quite nice 
[20:40:13] <lotuseater> do you know the April project by phantomics?
[20:40:23] <lotuseater> and pff Dyalog :D

[20:40:54] <ck_> the ? was in regards to the pff ;)
[20:41:22] <lotuseater> i also have to learn more APL, will have more impact on my mind than Clojure or most other stuff.
[20:41:31] <gilberth> lotuseater: SBCL has this secret command line argument to increase it. No 'sbcl --help' for me, though.
[20:41:47] <lotuseater> Dyalog is Dyalog and they aren't the only wise for APL
[20:42:03] <lotuseater> gilberth: yes something is there
[20:42:18] <ck_> --dynamic-space-size for sbcl, I think
[20:42:35] <lotuseater> ck_: but the Dyalog APL tutor is very good, I was at chapter 15
[20:42:57] <lotuseater> so throwing one terabyte RAM at sbcl :D
[20:43:51] <gilberth> Still silly that such an argument is needed.
[20:43:55] *** Quits: zacts (~zacts@user/zacts) (Quit: Client closed)
[20:43:59] <ck_> Sometimes commercial vendors have something to go for them. I looked at how AllegroCL did on macos, and they got a font problem so everything is placeholder squares. Sad
[20:44:00] <lotuseater> yes
[20:44:32] <lotuseater> ck_: and luckily they don't "own" APL
[20:46:46] <lotuseater> it's math and nobody should own math (or think they do as it is part of nature)
[20:47:40] <selwyn> i tried to have terabyte sized arrays in sbcl it didn´t end well
[20:47:49] <lotuseater> wow
[20:47:59] <lotuseater> that's much
[20:48:49] <lotuseater> how much space does SBCL allocate for a bignum? and another question, when i have a bit-vector, does it really need 1bit per bit? other langs allocate 1 byte per bit
[20:49:15] <selwyn> to date, it´s the only thing where i was able to say ´i could do this in another language but not in lisp´
[20:49:34] <selwyn> numpy can probably handle arrays of that size
[20:50:32] <lotuseater> oh hmm
[20:50:42] <selwyn> idk about bignums, but i was allocating a 128⁶ array of type (complex double-float) which came out to a terabyte
[20:51:06] <lotuseater> okay
[20:51:09] <selwyn> it was always a long shot tbh
[20:51:35] <selwyn> i was going to do numerical things with such arrays
[20:52:03] <lotuseater> (make-array '#.(loop for i from 1 to 12 collect i))
[20:52:26] <selwyn> and is it practical to do a large number of ffts on such objects
