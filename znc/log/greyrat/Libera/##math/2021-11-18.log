[00:14:28] <Z-module> nothing else assumed

[00:14:55] <cuppajoeman> sounds hot
[00:16:26] <cuppajoeman> I've been using \mathbb{F} for field, what can  I use for ring?
[00:16:54] <Z-module> "R" is fairly common, as is "A" in the commutative case
[00:17:13] <leah2> certainly a groupoid needs inverses?
[00:17:23] <Z-module> no leah2, not even associativity
[00:17:40] <qergle> Z-module had extra coffee today. His scroll/minute is off the charts.
[00:17:52] <Z-module> the problem is that the category theory meaning of "groupoid" suggests somethjing quite different.
[00:17:57] <leah2> there seem to be two definitions of groupoids :p
[00:18:03] <Z-module> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_(algebra)
[00:18:05] <Z-module> yes
[00:18:08] <cuppajoeman> maybe thats why they made it called magma
[00:18:23] <Z-module> the older one has been pretty much totally replaced by magma
[00:18:25] <qergle> even the markov bot would not be able to keep up!  :)
[00:18:36] <qergle> i forgot the name of the bot :(
[00:18:38] <cuppajoeman> after volcanic eruption of anger having two definitions same name being different
[00:19:46] <Z-module> by the way, cuppajoeman, that \mathbb{F} thing is most often only for a finite field with q elements, and then it's written  \mathbb{F}_q
[00:20:04] <cuppajoeman> oh I've been using it for general field, might have been a bad
[00:20:17] <Z-module> though one does still see  GF(q)   a fair amount (stands for Galois field)
[00:20:38] <qergle> I remembered!!!! "larou"
[00:20:46] <Z-module> For an unspecified field, "K" or "k" seem to be most common.
[00:21:08] <Z-module> (with algebraic geometers preferring "k", most others preferring "K")
[00:21:15] <qergle> i wonder what happened to larou. we need it back.
[00:21:55] <Z-module> but of course notation varies all over the map, in general
[00:22:38] <Z-module> I reeeeeeeeeeally hate older algebra papers where they use "R" for the rational field. I have to force my brain to think wrong, to comprehend those papers.
[00:24:35] <cuppajoeman> Do I have to prove that -1 != 0 ?
[00:24:53] <Z-module> Then of course there are famous things like Sylow's original paper proving his three theorems on finite groups, in which... guess what he uses throughout to denote the prime in question?
[00:25:05] <Z-module> not p, but n
[00:25:19] <Z-module> (and it's in French)
[00:25:37] <Z-module> cuppajoeman: that's false in the ring {0}, but true for all others
[00:26:04] *** Parts: critr (~critr@user/critr) (.)
[00:26:16] <Z-module> in {0}, we have  x + 0 = 0 + x = x  and  x0 = 0x = x  for all x, so 0 is both "the 0" and "the 1" of this ring
[00:27:16] <cuppajoeman> x0 = 0x = x ?
[00:27:37] <Z-module> yes, in the ring {0}, the only x there is is 0
[00:27:43] <Z-module> and 0*0 = 0  holds in all rings
[00:27:46] <cuppajoeman> oh yes
[00:28:10] <cuppajoeman> so if we have ring with at least two elements how do they become differentiated?
[00:31:32] <Z-module> Take the 1 in R.  If 1*1 = 0 in R, then 0 = 1 and that gives every x = 1*x = 0*x = 0   so this is only the ring {0}.  So in our nonzero ring, we have 1 != 0.

[00:37:25] <Z-module> There are zillions of odd little implications purely about basic ring arithmetic you can do. Here's one I love.  Say R is a ring with 1, and that some element x has a right inverse (so some y with x*y = 1) but x has no left inverse. (There are simple matrix ring examples where this happens.) Prove that x must actually have infinitely many right inverses.
[00:37:46] <Z-module> This can be done using "pure juggling", just stuff with ring axioms, no theory whatsoever.
[00:39:16] <Z-module> yes, for all sorts of reasons having to do with convience in theorems, we disallow the ring {0} to be called a field, even though it does satisfy all field axioms other than 0 != 1.

(for example, x^1=300 would translate to h_theta(x) =

[01:24:01] <tkr> cuppajoeman: Maybe. Let's say that an axiom (A) implies theorem (T). That is A => T. Following the constructions of logic, I think you need to show that (not T) => (not A). I believe then A <=> T, which would mean that if A is an exiom, then T is an axiom also.

[01:47:27] <jmorris> 8:04 AM <tkr> cuppajoeman: To further explain: if you have an axiom (A [ASSUMED TO BE TRUE!!]) that implies A => T (theorem). Then by *only* applying the simplest rules of logic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraposition), you can show that if ~T => ~A it automatically follows that A <=> T.
[01:47:36] <jmorris> no
[01:48:13] <tkr> Now, if I somehow could show that that ~F (not getting fat) => ~S (not eating sausages), we could deduct that F <=> S. (But only if we the previous assumptions S => F is still hold to be true!)

[01:54:19] <tkr> ska: I think re-sampling is more efficient, because scaling could just cause the _same_ sample to be thrown out again (and again...) if if fails? You would have the determine the direction of the scaling before resampling for this to be efficient. How to do that more efficiently than re-sampling? No proof here, though.

[06:10:47] <Z-module> yes, if the language has only countably many relation/function/constant symbols, then there are countably many formulas

[06:12:00] <cuppajoeman> that makes sense, but why not?

[06:12:31] <Z-module> so any choice function   {all representable functions} -> {formulas}   that sends a function f to some phi_f that works for f, must be injective. So there can only be countably many representable functions
[06:13:42] <Z-module> two functions f, g on N^k are distinct iff some tuple (a_1,...,a_k) in N^k exists with f(a_1,...,a_k) != g(a_1,...,a_k)

If phi represents f, then since (a~, m) is in the graph of f, we have  N_FL |- phi(a~, m)   but (a~, m) is *not* in the graph of g, so if this same phi represents g as well, then   N_FL |- !phi(a~, m).

[06:54:13] <sybariten> if we're talking summer here for instance there is somethign called convective precipitation and i would guess, given the size of those two places that the probability would then in fact be independent
[06:54:22] <jmorris> its not
[06:54:28] <jmorris> its obvious
[06:54:34] <sybariten> how do you mean
[06:55:00] <jmorris> rain isnt uniformly distributed over the area of the earth
[06:55:15] <sybariten> no... not really...
[06:55:29] <jmorris> if its raining at (0,0) then its probably raining at (0,0.01)
[06:55:35] <jmorris> so it cant be independent
[06:55:57] <sybariten> well like i said that all depends on the scale there
[06:56:03] <jmorris> it doesnt
[06:56:14] <jmorris> the probabilities just change in scale
[06:56:37] <sybariten> yes. with a front there are things you could say, but with convective precipitation it's a different mathematics
[06:56:49] <sybariten> that's why few models catch it, on that scale
[06:57:01] <audiobirb> jmorris, thanks for helping me. i mean, because h_theta(x) contains multiple x_<index> inputs, and only one parameter x^i is given, the other x_<index> inputs are not defined and thus does not make sense
[06:57:06] <jmorris> im not talking about modelling rain
[06:57:22] <jmorris> im talking about the obvious fact that the rain in Brooklyn is not independent from the rain in Queens
[06:59:06] <sybariten> I dont understand what you mean with that. Is a rain in Luxemburg independent from a rain in Saarbrucken?
[07:00:10] <jmorris> no
[07:00:21] <jmorris> I don't know where that is btw
[07:00:50] <memorye> they arent disjoint
[07:01:16] <memorye> oh you mean buy only one
[07:01:19] <memorye> and have it be red
[07:01:20] <memorye> ok
[07:01:20] <sybariten> So no rain is independent from another rain...? Or..? I don´t follow. Maybe meteorology wasnt the best analogy  :)  Spent too long in that area to look at it with normal eyes maybe
[07:01:32] <sybariten> memorye: only one yes. Strange example
[07:01:44] <jmorris> its obvious by the mechanics of rain
[07:01:46] <sybariten> I'll go with the die and the coin for my example
[07:02:13] <sybariten> jmorris: i don't quite follow what you mean witrh the mechanics of rain here
[07:02:28] <memorye> so imagine a set of ways the world could be
[07:02:34] <memorye> and let area denote probabilty
[07:03:03] <jmorris> sybariten: if its raining in (0,0) its likely to be raining in (0,1) where these are meter units
[07:03:07] <memorye> and you notice that all the ways with you buying only 1 car and its read are not overlapping the ways where you buy only one car ant its blue
[07:03:14] <jmorris> there's no cutoff to this
[07:03:19] <jmorris> only the probabilities change
[07:03:27] <jmorris> even if you can't measure it
[07:03:28] <jmorris> its obvious
[07:03:32] <memorye> and now as to the issue of dependence. dependence will only happen when they AREN't disjoint

[07:12:20] <memorye> like if you have five equal sized targets and how close they are together mattering....well with an archer it would matter, but randomly it wouldnt
[07:12:43] <Decker> think the idea was that probability is symmetric over space, and if it's raining, it's probably raining the same chance in your front yard as backyard (though when I was in florida, I did have it rain in only one)
[07:12:48] <sybariten> yes, and i was talking about convective precipitation
[07:13:08] <memorye> equal areas equally likely to be hit
[07:14:16] <jmorris> sybariten: but rain has a cause
[07:14:39] <sybariten> yeah but some of those systems are chaotic
[07:14:40] <jmorris> its not selected uniformly

[07:17:30] <jmorris> if I have a function f(x, y) : R^2 -> R

[07:35:01] <sybariten> So. A and B and C all have different probabilities, between 0 and 1 ofcourse. A and B are independent, they tell me. So are A and C. And C is ...uh , belonging to B, i believe. I am supposed to calculate Pr (A u B u C) .
[07:35:11] <sybariten> Heres what i'm guessing, for the diagram
[07:35:17] <jmorris> yes
[07:35:19] <jmorris> as I said
[07:35:21] <jmorris> B u C = B
[07:35:30] <jmorris> so P(A u B u C) = P(A u B)
[07:35:34] <sybariten> https://imgur.com/a/TSPenv8
[07:35:42] <jmorris> which is simple to calculate
[07:35:48] <jmorris> since you know A and B are independent
[07:35:57] <jmorris> so P(A u B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B)
[07:36:05] <jmorris> and you know all of these values
[07:36:09] <jmorris> so you're done
[07:36:30] <sybariten> but i mean they could also be overlapping in this diagram couldnt they? even if they are independent? That would mean the union area is different cause then i need to subtract that intersection thing?
[07:36:53] <jmorris> what?
[07:37:00] <jmorris> I just did that
[07:37:13] <jmorris> P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)
[07:38:27] <memorye> ok
[07:38:49] <memorye>  independence is going to be something about the ratio of their overlap to their remaining area
[07:39:02] <jmorris> no its not

[07:39:34] <jmorris> not a sentence

[07:39:46] <jmorris> you don't need a diagram
[07:39:50] <jmorris> I just told you how to solve the problem
[07:40:02] <jmorris> a diagram is not helpful
[07:40:15] <sybariten> We use diagrams in this course th ough
[07:40:44] <memorye> if  A and B are independent the ratio of A AND B with A has to be the same as the ratio of B NOT A to NOT A

[07:41:56] <sybariten> I dont know what i can actually conclude from the information i'm given
[07:42:03] <jmorris> I just told you
[07:42:22] <jmorris> B and C are disjoin so Pr(A u B u C) = P(A u B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B)
[07:42:24] <memorye> how much of A's area is B AND A. how much of NOT A's area is B NOT A
[07:42:33] <jmorris> jesus

[08:28:28] <qergle> if this were random, there's no reason there couldn't be an outcome where a lot of them happen to be clustered around the nuclear power plant, right?

[08:29:04] <qergle> now say you're the lead lawyer on the class action lawsuit trying to get reparations for the cancer...
[08:29:10] <qergle> how would your argument go?
[08:30:15] <memorye> i would start with a probability distribution about the prior likelihood of this stuff being random versus much likelier around nuclear power plants and show that the random hypothesis started out much much more likely

[08:30:38] <PlanckWalk> Haha, the jury just died of boredom.

[08:40:47] <memorye> .99*.99*.99*.99
[08:41:18] <memorye> pi0 they want an upper bound on the probability it will fail
[08:41:45] <qergle> 1-that
[08:41:46] <memorye> like worst case scenario what would the likely hood of it failing be
[08:41:48] <memorye> yeah
[08:41:52] <memorye> 1 minus that
[08:42:23] <pi0> that is not the upper
[08:42:25] <memorye> because worst case scenario they are each 1/100 likely to fail
[08:42:42] <memorye> so to NOT fail would be .99*.99*.99*.99
[08:42:48] <pi0> 0.0176
[08:43:11] <memorye>  and then to fail would be 1 minus that, IF the parts were the most defective they were allowed to be. but it not be even that bad
[08:44:14] <memorye> 0.03940399?
[08:44:29] <memorye> mine cant be
[08:45:03] <pi0> which formula did i need to use?
[08:45:16] <memorye> just the one for OR
[08:45:21] <memorye> really and then subtract
[08:45:48] <memorye>  you want to ask if they parts are worst in the range of faulty allowed, what would be the chances of the think NOT having a fault
[08:46:41] <memorye> so that means it has to pass the first one which happens 99 percent of the time, and then pass the second one which happens 99 percent of THAT time, and then pass the third one which happens 99 percent of THAT time, and then pass the last one which happens 99 percent of THAT time.
[08:47:24] <memorye> so thats .99x.99 x .99 x .99 of the time. so the chance of if not having a fault even with the worst allowable parts is
[08:47:47] <memorye> 0.03940399
[08:47:50] <memorye> no
[08:48:01] <memorye> 96059601

[08:48:36] <Decker> ya

[08:53:34] <memorye> is that variance?
[08:53:40] <memorye> you dont need variance

[08:54:39] <PlanckWalk> P(A u B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A & B), so if P(A) and P(B) are bounded above, your maximum is when P(A & B) = 0.

[10:58:02] <xardas> Points on the graph of y = f(3x) are of the form (3x, f(3x) )
[10:58:12] <xardas> right ?
[10:58:30] <qergle> no
[10:58:55] <qergle> oh, points on the curve, yes
[10:59:32] <xardas> That's what's confusing me
[10:59:48] <xardas> Is it (x, f(3x) ) or (3x, f(3x) )
[10:59:50] <xardas> ?
[10:59:54] <qergle> heh
[11:00:00] <qergle> it depends on your x-axis
[11:00:21] <qergle> f(3x) = f(g(x)) where g(x)=3x
[11:00:47] <qergle> so you have a map x↦3x↦f(3x)
[11:01:00] <PlanckWalk> The graph of "y = <some expressions involving x>" usually means "the set of points (x,y) such that the equation is satisfied".
[11:01:15] <qergle> xardas: so let's take an example, ok?
[11:01:18] *** Quits: Trigo (~NeedMathH@64.201.115.44) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[11:01:23] <xardas> alright
[11:01:27] <qergle> say f(x)=2x+5  (a simple line)
[11:01:37] <xardas> Ok
[11:01:41] <PlanckWalk> Doesn't matter whether it's  y = 2x, f = f(x), or y = f(3x+1)^2 - x.
[11:01:57] <qergle> now, say you wanted to plot y=f(3x)

[11:02:17] <qergle> that would be y=2(3x)+5=6x+5
[11:02:32] <qergle> so a new function g(x)=6x+6
[11:02:35] <qergle> so a new function g(x)=6x+5
[11:02:45] <qergle> which is the composition of two functions

[11:03:01] <qergle> x↦3x and x↦2x+5

[11:04:11] <xardas> so we're not talking about a horizontal compression of f(x) here ?
[11:04:25] <qergle> we are
[11:04:48] <qergle> if you plot (x,f(x)) and (x,f(3x)), you'll notice the compression
[11:05:00] <pavonia> Visually it's the same curve as f(x) but compressed
[11:05:04] <qergle> which is why i said you could simply take the (x,f(x)) plot and re-label the x-axis
[11:06:30] <qergle> you should try it with something simple, like f(x)=x^2 or so
[11:07:26] <xardas> I got your point actually
[11:07:34] <xardas> so here an example I just did
[11:07:45] <xardas> Here's a graph of f
[11:07:46] <xardas> https://ibb.co/kHLSmJz
[11:07:55] <xardas> when I applied y = f(2x) on it
[11:07:57] <xardas> I got this
[11:08:10] <xardas> https://ibb.co/k3r7RL4
[11:08:31] <xardas> This doesn't look like a horizontal compression to me
[11:08:40] <qergle> yeah, it's not right
[11:09:07] <qergle> you want (3,2) not (12,2) on the f(2x) plot
[11:09:27] <qergle> because at x=3, f(2*3)=f(6)=2, so (3,2)
[11:10:28] <qergle> the four new points should be: (-2,2), (-1,-2), (0,-2), (3,2)

[11:12:09] <qergle> that's the rightmost point
[11:12:12] <xardas> Yes

[11:14:14] <qergle> when x=3 what is 2x?
[11:14:22] <xardas> 6
[11:14:31] <qergle> ok, so when x=3 what is f(2x)?

[11:15:58] <xardas> where did the 3 come from
[11:16:04] <xardas> that's my question

[11:17:34] <xardas> this is counter-intuitive really
[11:17:44] <xardas> instead of multiply x by 2
[11:17:50] <xardas> we're dividing it by 2
[11:18:12] <qergle> depends on which direction you're thinking about
[11:18:25] <qergle> if you think about 3 -> 6 (we're multiplying by 2)

[14:28:39] <rubiksdream> hi, does anyone know why the following is true? Let f = (1/z)prod_{j=1}^n (z-a_j)^{lambda_j} on the unit disk, a_j on the unit circle distinct and oriented clockwise say, lambda_j > 0 with sum_{j=1}^n lambda_j = n is necessarily injective?
[14:29:03] <rubiksdream> here we are choosing some branch of (z-a_j)^{lambda_j} holomorphic in the unit disk
[14:29:32] <rubiksdream> on the boundary, one can show that f has constant argument on the arcs (a_j, a_{j+1}), so that f's continuous extension to the boundary maps the boundary to a star with n segments
[14:29:51] <rubiksdream> what I want to show is that in fact the boundary of Im(f) = f(D) contains the entire star
[14:29:58] <rubiksdream> it is clear that it is contained in that star by the open mapping theorem
[14:30:35] <rubiksdream> I ask because of this post https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2686908/find-the-image-of-unit-disk-under-fz-frac1z-prod-k-1nz-a-k-lam?rq=1, whose answer seems to only show that the f maps the boundary to the star, but not that it does not map any interior point to the star
[14:30:46] <rubiksdream> perhaps this is obviously impossible for some reason I am missing
[14:30:56] <schillingklaus> open mapping theorem in complex analysis?
[14:31:00] <rubiksdream> right
[14:32:22] <rubiksdream> well, not sure if its really because of the open mapping theorem, but basically if p is some point in bd(Im(f)), there is some convergent sequence x_n \in D s.t. f(x_n) -> p, and x_n cannot converge to an interior point or else f takes a neighbourhood of that interior point to a neighbourhood of p, so p was not in bd(Im(f))
[14:32:44] <rubiksdream> ah yeah, technically that is using the open mapping theorem

[14:33:51] <rubiksdream> this shows (for any nonconstant holomorphic map extending continuously to the boundary) that bd(Im(f)) \subset f(bdDomain), but it seems like this SE post has assumed the otherside holds for our particular choice of f, and I cannot see why

[19:21:28] <Guest59> i dont want to use the alternating series test cause i dont think it has been discussed yet.
[19:21:28] <Guest59> From the Ratio Test, I get | a_(n+1) / a_n | = ... = (n+1)(n^2 + 2) / (n(n+1)^2 + 2).
[19:22:11] <Guest59> would the limit as n->inf of that ratio be 1? The largest terms are n^3 on both the denominator and numerator
[19:23:00] <int-e> so that's not conclusive either

[19:35:10] <Guest59> For SUM_(n=0)^inf [ln(n) / n^2], the divergence test is inconclusive. I am unsure if ln(n) > n^2 so I cannot use the Integral Test (also that might just be a lot of effort to integrate). Ratio Test... |a_(n+1) / a_(n)| = ln(n+1)/(n+1)^2 *  n^2 / ln(n)
[19:35:34] <Guest59> and I don't know how to simplify that to take the limit
[19:35:52] <qergle> i hope you don't mean n=0 as lower limit
[19:36:10] <Guest59> oops. n=1
[19:36:38] <Guest59> oh wait, this limit is just 1
[19:36:43] <Guest59> so Ratio Test is useless
[19:37:03] <Z-module> on that last, for n >= 2,    n/(n^2 + 2) >= n/(n^2 + n) = 1/(n + 1)   so the series is not absolutely convergent.

[19:58:50] <Guest59> I am trying to figure out the converge/divergence of the series: SUM_(n=1)^(inf) [ (2n+1)! / (-3)^n ]. I decide to try the Ratio Test: |a_(n+1) / a_n| = |(2n+3)! / (-3)^(n+1)   * (-3)^n / (2n+1)!| which simplifies to: (1/3) * (2n+3)(2n+2). But the limit of this product as n->inf is infinity...

[22:08:49] <lf94> Question: for t+2 = sqrt(t^2 + 1) , why can't I move 2 over to the right side and then put everything to the power of 2?
[22:09:09] <qergle> you mean square?
[22:09:13] <qergle> you can, just be careful
[22:09:56] <riv> t = sqrt(t^2 + 1) - 2
[22:10:03] <qergle> the better way would be to square firsth
[22:10:10] <lf94> so it becomes: t^2 = sqrt(t^2 + 1)^2 - 2^2
[22:10:15] <AimHere> lf94, if you do that, you still have a sqrt() so it's not likely to help
[22:10:18] <qergle> lf94: no
[22:10:24] <lf94> why cant i do that
[22:10:30] <riv> (A - B)^2 is not A^2 - B^2, it's A^2 - 2AB + B^2
[22:10:35] <qergle> it would be (sqrt(t^2+1)-2)^2
[22:10:46] <lf94> but why
[22:10:54] <qergle> why what?
[22:10:59] <riv> I showed why
[22:11:04] <bluss> lf94: if it happens step by step you'll see
[22:11:08] <AimHere> It's just how multiplication and addition works.
[22:11:24] <AimHere> (a+b)*(a+b) = a*a + a*b + b*a + b*b

[22:11:39] <bluss> lf94: you said t = sqrt(t^2 + 1) - 2  and then square both sides. So you need to expand (sqrt(t^2 + 1) - 2)^2

[22:12:17] <lf94> Hm
[22:12:42] <qergle> if you square first you have t^2+4t+4=t^2+1
[22:12:49] <bluss> but anyway, what qergle said, seeing a few steps ahead, probably square both sides first
[22:13:04] <lf94> My question is more like: why is it a^2 instead of a^2-b^2
[22:14:32] <bluss> if you have  c = a - b and square both sides, what happens?
[22:14:39] <riv> lf94: Did you see this: (A - B)^2 is not A^2 - B^2, it's A^2 - 2AB + B^2
[22:14:40] <qergle> your question is actually why it's (a-b)^2 and not a^2-b^2
[22:15:14] <lf94> err, yeah
[22:16:01] <riv> Does it make sense?
[22:16:07] <lf94> I see then - when going to the power of whatever, you have to do the whole term
[22:16:22] <lf94> a = b -> a^2 = b^2
[22:16:29] <riv> yes

[23:28:23] <droid3> take for example the nonlinear pde equation for minimal surfaces. It easy to find the caternary and special case. But if one gives you some weird boundary condition how do you know it gives you a unquie solution so we can approximate it ??? Is one example of where my question of numerical approximation algorithms to PDE is
[23:29:04] *** Joins: whatsupdoc (uid509081@hampstead.irccloud.com)
[23:32:50] <droid3> This problem of minimal surfaces is an example of a nonlinear PDE equation that is more interesting/meaningful when boundary conditions are given. So how do we know when an arbitrary boundary condition for a minimal surface has a unquie solution,no solution , or many solutions.
[23:33:42] <droid3> Obviously if the nonlinear PDE of a minimal surface is given with initial value conditions then sure there be a unquie solution by the CAUCHY KOWALEWSKI THEOREM.
[23:34:43] <droid3> And then one could use the many finite element method/numerical approximation algorithms to obtain as good as he wants approximation to "the solution of the nonlinear pde"
[23:35:19] <droid3> But its hard to know when boundary conditions in general yield unquie solutions so far for me.
[23:35:38] <droid3> So at this point how does one approximate any thing?
[23:35:54] *** Joins: isekaijin (~isekaijin@user/isekaijin)
[23:35:59] <droid3> The only way i see is to add enough boundary constraints in some way to give a unquie solution.

[23:49:35] <droid3> thinking about it a little more... all this boils down to the question of
[23:50:20] <droid3> OF DO WE HAVE A WAY TO ADD BOUNDARY CONDITIONS SO THAT WE CAN ALWAYS BUT THE PDE IN THE FORM OF HAVING ONLY A UNQUIE SOLUTION TO APPROXIMATE.
[23:51:18] <droid3> ALSO IS THERE ANY METHOD TO DETERMINE WHEN BOUNDARY CONDITIONS HAVE NO SOLUTION , ONE SOLUTION , OR MANY SOLUTIONS
[23:53:29] <droid3> OBVIOUSLY WHEN WE ARE IN THE CASE OF LINEAR,QUASILINEAR, SECOND ORDER PDE THIS IS MUCH SOLVED. BUT FOR THE GENERAL NONLINEAR PDE IS A WHOLE OTHER BALL GAME THEN JUST LINEAR PDE OR PDE OF ORDER 2
