[13:49:25] <epony> Java is just a virtual applications environment and runtime, rather than a language of choice
[13:49:28] <roxlu> jelly: but I'm curious why I get a ECONNABORTED (linux) when trygin 127.0.0.1; ?
[13:49:40] <epony> it's targeted by other languages as a bytecode machine
[13:49:47] <pikapika> Linux and BSDs are C kernels, Windows also is written in C at the kernel levels I think

[13:52:05] <roxlu> jelly: maybe it's because 127.0.0.1 is handled "specially" by the kernel (just a guess). I don't think I get the same errno when I connect to e.g. 192.168. ip.

[14:10:39] <roxlu> Decker: ah, thanks that's a good answer! 
[14:10:46] <epony> it is exactly in AAA PC games
[14:10:57] <epony> from the days of Doom
[14:11:10] <PlanckWalk> The biggest market share *per game developed* is in high end AAA games (PC and console)
[14:11:15] <roxlu> f843d0: no, but Decker just cleared it up :) 
[14:11:16] <pikapika> Of course
[14:11:19] <pikapika> Those are the priciest
[14:11:28] <epony> and most efficient
[14:11:28] <pikapika> but also proportionally they have exponentially less number of total customers
[14:11:30] <vdamewood> I miss Warcraft.
[14:11:33] <f843d0> roxlu: just asking because ECONNABORTED is not documented in connect, which is a bit strange. There are only ECONNREFUSED and ECONNRESET
[14:11:45] <epony> pikapika, wrong again
[14:11:49] <pikapika> Because of simple and natural inverse power laws wrt price of hardware
[14:11:52] <PlanckWalk> So if you have a good development team and can make a high end game, you're probably better off makign high end games for PC and consoles.

[14:15:56] <duuude> everyone uses chrome on phone

[14:49:06] <f843d0> GNU / Linux can be hard to manage if simply "fleeing away" from Windoze
[14:49:11] <epony> Linux has become heavy and slow like the commercial systems too, and it started with lower efficiency and lower performance

[14:50:01] <PlanckWalk> Not just bloat. Also making them worse to use in many other ways.
[14:50:02] <duuude> the main problem is redhat

[14:50:44] <epony> in fact, it's a fairly modern "contained" problem

[14:52:28] <pikapika> Its not a matter of brand loyalty

[14:58:08] <pikapika> CUDA is a big market
[14:58:43] <f843d0> Anyway, from my experiences, for very specific, limited uses, GNU / Linux fits most of the things. But when it comes to a bit more of "flexibility" for the general average user, especially from people with a Windoze background, gets a lot harder
[14:58:55] <pikapika> And the moment Intel comes out with their GPU and it continues to have good relations with kernel people, the CUDA people will immediately throw away their nvidia trash and literally poop on it
[14:59:33] <PlanckWalk> Uhhh, intel's drivers suck.  They have always sucked.  They will almost certainly suck for the foreseeable future.
[14:59:48] <duuude> I would like to see how much marketshare does CUDA bring
[14:59:48] <pikapika> PlanckWalk, at least they aren't actively hostile to driver authors
[15:00:06] <pikapika> That already makes them way better to use in practice
[15:00:09] <PlanckWalk> Yes, they are much more cooperative in providing their flaming bag of poop.

[15:03:10] <epony> there is more than 1 model of a laptop and computer

[20:17:45] <pikapika> There are many more factors to consider than just asymptotic complexity
[20:18:05] <pikapika> For one, the asymptotic formula hides all constants and lower order terms which could be significant in many algorithms
[20:18:52] <pikapika> For example, fast fourier transform based multiplication is O(n*lg n*lg lg n) in theory but in practice is only faster than O(n^2) multiplication beyond a few thousand digits
[20:19:14] <pikapika> which is of course still a very practically useful size and FFT multiplication isn't really "astronomical"

[20:19:45] <pikapika> And another factor is that, modern memory access, cache and branch prediction concerns also distort a purely Big-O based analysis

[20:25:59] <pikapika> pyzozord, see the Wikipedia example: f(x)=O(g(x)) means f(x) <= M*g(x) for all x>=x0

[21:04:51] <pikapika> I just said, there need not be a deeper reason than that ubuntu comes with a base configuration that is closer to what the user wants

[23:06:00] <[itchyjunk]> issue is when the two come into contact.

[23:43:31] <TheRedRipper> i do enjoy programming but with the way the industry is, and how much computers and such are ruining humans and our ability to do anything on our own idk if i want to be a part of that
[23:43:50] <TheRedRipper> i might just become and electrical engineer and work for PacBell or PG&E
[23:43:56] <sonny> also it just occured to me, cryptocurrencies are going to require an environment to be used in, so I wonder if that's related to facebook change to meta and doing a early 2000s virtual world
[23:44:08] <TheRedRipper> be a fun job, work outside, calls everywhere and such, would be nice

[23:44:35] <TheRedRipper> maybe ill make my own art and get some $$ from NFTs haha
[23:44:37] <sonny> I think it's clear that they won't

[23:45:37] <TheRedRipper> but no doubt its creators was very smart
[23:45:54] <sonny> TheRedRipper: I think computers could be so much better, but for companies the ends justifiy the means. So we get over complicated, bloated stuff and they cruise off a 20 year legacy

[23:47:22] <sonny> it's not that bad, some artists have told fans not to bring any
[23:47:40] <TheRedRipper> not to mention peoples dependence on stuff like google and the general lazyness and monopoly that is held by companies atm just.. sets me the wrong way
[23:47:46] <sonny> it's been a massive succes overall as far as I can tell

[23:55:39] <sonny> so I have this idea that commerical applications (most software projects) can be done in 10k-20k loc or less
[23:55:50] *** Quits: jdmark (~jdmark@user/jdmark) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:56:27] <koollman> sure. "do_what_I_mean();". the tricky part is the size of the framework implementing that ;)

[23:56:45] <alefir> I don't understand how anyone unironically things NFTs are a good purchase
[23:56:53] <sonny> what I think is, it must be cheaper to use more developers, hardware, etc maintaing commercial applications that grow to million loc than to rewrite or refactor into that size

[23:57:18] <koollman> sonny: 20k loc isn't *that* much for most purpose unless the application is really not doing much
[23:57:52] <GeDaMo> sonny: you should look at the STEPS project, an attempt to produce a complete computing system: OS, dev tools, applications in less than 20K lines of code
[23:57:57] <sonny> koollman: yeah, that's my premise
[23:58:02] <koollman> human time is generally the costly thing optimized away in most software projects. Paying someone to craft the perfect minimal application is pointless
[23:58:06] <sonny> GeDaMo: thanks

[23:59:10] <koollman> but, how would you count it ? 10k lines of vba isn't much, but, well, there's a whole office installation around it to make it work. And I *know* applications that are basically glorified spreadheets. or actual excel spreadsheets
