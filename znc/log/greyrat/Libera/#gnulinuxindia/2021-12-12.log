I feel its good, even tho he got fame which you think is too much, i still think its valid, he is in 7th grade and that it self sells it to the publicity. Even if u were helping him ppl wont care about you. And about making something, if u want to make something to get popular i don't think it'll go well in the long run. I think its more fun to do stuff which you have passio
[19:27:42] <pystardust> towards, and follow your morals and intentions
[19:29:09] <SurajKushwah[m]> pystardust: But than how we will get a Lambo?
