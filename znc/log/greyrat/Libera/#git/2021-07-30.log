[00:31:56] <Guest64> Guys, thank you very much, you helped me a lot
[00:32:13] <ikke> you're welcome
[00:39:07] * splud drops some money in the swear jar.
[00:40:17] <splud> So, I have a commit in one feature branch, which is based on another branch. This feature - really JUST that one commit, and not all the history before it - needs to be merged to some other version branches.
[00:40:42] <splud> Pull request wants to bring in history, rebase wants to pull in history.
[00:41:15] <ikke> cherry-pick that commit onto the base branch
[00:41:44] <splud> I want to create a clean feature branch that is that one commit replayed on top of another branch, and then set up a PR for that into the other version branch.
[00:41:52] <splud> So I've basically got to export a patch?
[00:42:07] <ikke> fetch the branch and use cherry-pick?
[00:42:13] *** Joins: rahl- (~rahl@102.114.61.188)
[00:45:12] <splud> but, this won't be the same commit in the other branch, and if the other content (which I don't want to be responsible for vetting right now to get THIS change merged) gets merged (and it will, at some point), won't my cherry picked stuff become a conflict?
[00:45:28] *** Quits: rahl (~rahl@102.114.123.208) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[00:45:41] <ikke> well, there is no way to merge just a single commit without it's history
[00:45:50] <ikke> so you can't have your cake and eat it too
[00:46:03] <Guest64> ))))
[00:46:36] <ikke> and using cherry-pick, or exporting a patch and applying that does not make a difference
[00:46:57] <ikke> note that if there are no other conflicting changes, then it would not be a conflict
[00:47:06] <splud> No, I totally get it that exporting a patch would do the same.
[00:47:47] <splud> alright, cherry picking it is.
[00:48:02] <ikke> Once that commit is merged, if you would rebase the other branch, that commit would most likely even just be skipped

[05:13:58] <pac1> I'm thinking along these lines:  local bare clone, worktrees for tracking branches representing current, long-term support and old long term support with additional worktrees for my changes. the upstream remote would be the official repo.  the origin remote would be my fork on sourceforge/github my changes would not be pushed to upstream, but to origin.

[13:42:43] <aiyion> Good mornng everyone. I've been using git for several years now and usually know my way around. I came across a possibly unusual "how to?"-question: Is it possible to read out, when a commit became part of a branch?

[13:45:39] <canton7> aiyion, no, that information is not recorded anywhere. Anyone can do 'git branch foo', and all of the commits reachable from the current HEAD are now part of the 'foo' branch
[13:45:55] <canton7> There's also no recorded history of when branch pointers were created, or move around
[13:46:11] <aiyion> that sucks, tahnks
[13:46:14] <aiyion> *thanks
[13:46:35] <canton7> You can answer a similar question though, which is to take all commits in the master branch and find the latest at a given point in time
[13:46:46] <strk> and no recorded history of *who* pushed to a given remote (sound like a similar need)
[13:46:56] <strk> as the "when" is really related to "where"
[13:47:06] <strk> when was that commit merged into a specific repository, right ?
[13:47:15] <strk> because the same commit could have landed to MY clone earlier than to YOUR clone
[13:47:25] <canton7> I.e. if you asssume that the master branch label hasn't been moved around
[13:47:30] <strk> and by different means (we both might have "allowed" the commitm to land in our clones)
[13:47:54] <strk> canton7: I think "point in time" is the issue here, basically
[13:48:14] <strk> you only know the Date field in the commit itself, but that's the time the commit was created, not the time it was pushed anywhere
[13:48:50] <canton7> Right, but that might be what they're after
[13:48:52] <aiyion> canton that similar question is sufficient.
[13:49:11] <canton7> In which case just `git show master@{date}`
[13:49:23] <canton7> Oh wait, taht's wrong
[13:49:26] <canton7> That uses the reflog
[13:49:30] <aiyion> mhm
[13:50:04] <osse> you will have to access the reflog of the central repo, which may not exist

[13:59:52] <ebeip90> Hello all!  I have made local modifications to Git's source code to add some new regexes for finding the start/end of a function (userdiff.c, with the -W flag).  I would prefer to not need to distribute a copy of Git with these additions.  I know I can set xfuncname, but it REALLY does not like multiple expressions (which are newline-separated in userdiff.c).  Specifically, it complains about any rule that begins with a "!" as these are inverse
[13:59:53] <ebeip90> matches, and Git complains about this.  What is the correct way to update my ~/.gitconfig to add multiple expressions for xfuncname -- simply putting in "\n" characters does not work, and I expect literal newlines in the expression break the gitconfig.

[14:03:16] <osse> hmm, I just tried  git config diff.foo.xfuncname $'foo\nbar' and it inserted an unquoted line into the config file that has \ and n in it
[14:03:34] <osse> I presume that's the thing that doesn't work?
[14:04:53] <ebeip90> I was manually editing the ~/.gitconfig rather than using the CLI, but I expect what you're seeing is the same as me.  The only difference being the first rule has a bang -- "!(do|not|want)\n(plz|match|me)" :(
[14:05:29] <osse> my config file doesn't have the quotes
[14:05:58] <osse> is ! like that legal regex to begin with?
[14:06:07] <ebeip90> Sorry, that was just an example -- though the quotes shouldn't matter anyway since they hold no special meaning in a regex
[14:06:13] <ebeip90> Yes, !foo is valid

[14:12:54] <osse> (this is what git config --add does)
[14:13:12] <ebeip90> Yeah just tried a bunch of ways (single-quote, double-quote, literal newline wrapping the expression or not -- but still always complains about "invalid regex" or "last expression cannot be negated".
[14:13:24] <ebeip90> Oh hmm, that might be neat
[14:14:19] <osse> Just be clear: You want a negative pattern and a positive pattern right? As opposed to a single regex that has a newline in it
[14:15:46] <ebeip90> I have several patterns.  The negations belong at the beginning of the list of patterns, so we don't proceed further.  I don't expect to match a literal newling character, but that's how they're separated in userdiff.c.  I tried making them all be one line, but that's not really possible with length single-line expressions.

[14:15:51] <ebeip90> For context
[14:16:13] <ebeip90> also, for ObjC which has multiple negations

[14:17:48] *** Joins: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse)
[14:18:02] <ebeip90> TL;DR is that I'm grouping all of the C++ regexes with the ObjC regexes, and this works fine if you modify userdiff.c.  However, trying to set it ~= on-the-fly with "git config" or "git -c" does not work.  I'll have to give the set-it-twice mechanism osse suggested and see where we get!

This can happen if you a) check out a tag, remote tracking branch, or SHA; or b) if you are in a submodule; or you are in the middle of a c) am or d) rebase that is stuck/conflicted. See !reattach
[17:14:25] <mackerman> !reattach
[17:14:25] <gitinfo> Letters refer to !detached. (a) and (b): 'git checkout branchname' to continue working on another branch, or 'git checkout -b branchname' to start a new one here; (c) git am --continue; (d) git rebase --continue

[17:16:33] <osse> oldmode 644 newmode 755 means that all the files have been chmod +x
[17:16:49] <kapil> yes i changed permissions
[17:17:03] <osse> that explains it, then
[17:17:03] <kapil> what it means?
[17:17:12] <osse> this just means that git noticed
[17:17:14] <rossy_> mackerman--Thank you!  so git rebase should let me continue with my current file status?
[17:17:39] <mackerman> rossy_: Which of the 4 situations apply to you?
[17:17:45] <kapil> if i change permissions to 644 it will fix the problem?
[17:17:59] <osse> yes
[17:18:03] <ebeip90_> Changing to 644 will probably break directory access
[17:18:15] <kapil> osse,  thank you so much
[17:18:45] <rossy_> I want to preserve my project as it is, and keep using my local repo and archiving to github (I work alone)
[17:18:46] <ebeip90_> This should do it, since git doesn't track directories: git ls-files | xargs chmod +x
[17:18:50] <osse> kapil: if there are no actual content changes you can probably do:  git checkout HEAD -- .
[17:19:07] <kapil> oh thanks
[17:19:17] <ebeip90_> This works too ^

[17:20:41] <rossy_> :) thanks osse, I am getting a bit confused here.
[17:20:43] <mackerman> rossy_: Did you make commits in the detached state, that you wish to keep?
[17:21:42] <rossy_> mackerman, I'm not positive, but it's probable (if not likely) that I did make commits in the detached state.
[17:21:59] <osse> what does git status say
[17:22:35] <rossy_> osse, are you asking me?
[17:22:36] <mackerman> rossy_: Then scenario (b)  applies.   git checkout -b  #  to create a new branch

[17:29:58] <rossy_> What happened is I worked my way into a mess, and then I attempted to recover by running 'git reset --hard HEAD

[17:59:49] <bremner> start with !book
[17:59:49] <gitinfo> There are several good books available about git; 'Pro Git' is probably the best: http://git-scm.com/book but also look at !bottomup !cs !gcs !designers !gitt !vcbe and !parable

[18:00:28] <osse> I don't really know. I've just been curious the whole time
[18:00:56] <osse> The best resources I can recommend a pretty basic, but there is one talk which goes a tiny bit under the hood that is really good

[22:00:06] <foo> ikke: FWIW, follow up from my mtu git push issue yesterday (it worked at mtu 1400 but not 1500): well, WISP called me back a few hours after we figured out mtu issue. They said something was consuming 10bmit down non-stop for the past 7 days on the network (which is pretty much when I arrived here). After process of elimination, turns out it was most likely my phone downloading the 3GB iOS update. I could
[22:00:12] <foo> clearly see ping times 300-900ms when my phone was on the network and sub 50ms when I took my phone off the network. Now that I've solved that, I also just re-tested file transfer of 4K file with mtu 1500 .... and it works fine now. Can you explain this? I'm confused why my phone downloading a file would affect me uploading a 4K file.

[23:08:38] <mackerman> If the concern is someone gaining unauthorized access to all the git repos, that is a use case for backups to a different, restricted system.
[23:09:21] *** Joins: BeautifulBaguett (~Beautiful@c-75-69-210-181.hsd1.nh.comcast.net)
[23:10:01] <Guest3> the concern is someone gaining unauthorized access to all my git repos, or a collaborator with write access going crazy, or a collaborator having THEIR password stolen and the attacker going crazy. That's why I'm making my local, non-cloud repos backup on my homeserver.
[23:10:27] <Guest3> Or even just a simple honest mistake where someone (even myself!) accidentally damages the repo. That's why people make backups.
[23:11:00] <Guest3> So to go back to my initial question...is "git fetch --all" a proper way to back up a cloud repo for this purpose?
[23:11:10] <mackerman> There is not one answer to that.
[23:11:44] <Guest3> I'll wait for a 2nd opinion :P
[23:12:01] <osse> fetch doesn't fetch everything by default. (--all means fetch from all remotes, not fetch everything from one remote)
[23:12:16] <osse> git clone --mirror with subsequent fetches should do the trick though
[23:12:37] <Guest3> osse: so first clone with "git clone --mirror", then after it's been cloned, a weekly "git fetch --all"?
[23:12:47] <osse> --mirror makes git configure fetch so that it fetches everything
[23:12:52] <osse> Guest3: still no need for --all
[23:12:55] <Guest3> ok
[23:12:58] <osse> but yes
[23:13:37] <Guest3> what happens if someone nukes the entire history and pushes it to the repo, and I fetch?
[23:14:01] *** Joins: Samian (~Sami@2620:10d:c091:480::1:4df9)
[23:14:20] <osse> you nuke the entire repository
[23:14:35] <Guest3> ok, so not really a solid backup plan
[23:14:49] *** Quits: kikijiki (~Thunderbi@user/kikijiki) (Quit: kikijiki)
[23:14:53] <osse> in the end nothing beats rsync
[23:14:54] <Guest3> is mackerman's initial suggestion of doing a cold backup the best thing to do then?
[23:15:17] <Guest3> yeah, it's just that at 500MB per repo, it can add up :/
[23:15:42] <osse> i'm no backup expert
[23:15:51] <osse> but there's software for that. deduplication and such
[23:16:02] <osse> anyway, git itself isn't a proper backup tool.
[23:16:21] <Guest3> why not? it's basically rsync for code
[23:16:27] <osse> you can enable the reflog for bare repos so that if you fetch in that mirrored clone of yours you can restore
[23:17:37] <mackerman> I consider a good backup to be immutable and near impossible to alter once it is taken.
[23:17:38] <osse> Guest3: the issue you pointed out yourself is one reason, for example. git assumes the data you push and fetch is good. it doesn't quality-check it
[23:18:03] <osse> but as I said, I'm no backup expert. I'm basically echoing what I've heard
[23:18:27] <osse> KDE used git as a backup tool a couple of years ago, and that went to shit. That was a weakness in Git itself that was patched, though
[23:18:33] <mackerman> git isn't that, the history can be deleted and changed in future fetches.
[23:19:41] <mackerman> Every copy of a repo having all the history is amazing.  If last week's  backup was good, you can go as far back in history as you wish.

[23:21:13] <osse> I was thinking more like git clone --mirror once, update it with fetch, and then every so often make a local copy of that
[23:21:44] <osse> cp -r foo.git /backups/$date/foo.git
[23:22:21] <mackerman> What you have now, a copy of the repo on different (local)  storage, is quite good.  You have something even if your git hosting has a problem, for example.

[23:23:10] <Guest3> Offtopic, but I figure some of you are webdevs. https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/resource/repositories  Look at this API, when I try to get my list of repos (so I can iterate over it to clone bitbucket.org/myaccount/$reponame in a loop)  it gives me like 150KB full of WAY TOO MUCH INFO, and people have to deal with
[23:23:11] <Guest3> paginations/multiple requests to get the full list of names. Is this considered a standard API? Or am I right to think it's trash?
[23:23:40] <mackerman> But the scenario you proposed was among the worst case: malicious deletes at the limit of  the pruning defaults.
[23:23:42] <Guest3> I've never written a web API so I don't know what's meant to be acceptable
[23:24:29] <Guest3> But if I was writing one I'd provide a simple way to just get the names of the repos in a basic array
[23:24:33] <osse> there is some filtering there

[23:28:35] <osse> I noticed that the pake you linked to had "Copyright 2015" at the bottom. Are you sure this is the latest version of the API? Atlassian renamed some of their products a couple of years ago...
