[00:06:06] <Bunny351> I think it would change nothing in general.
[00:06:59] <Bunny351> too much code exists already, side channel attacks still work, hardware has it's own vulnerabiltiies and programmers still make mistakes.
[00:07:17] <Bunny351> besides, even those memsafe languages have their mem-unsafe parts
[00:07:57] <Bunny351> it's the dream of fighting deficiencies in complex tech with more complex tech, futile in the end
[00:08:19] <Bunny351> they found bugs in CompCert, too
[00:09:05] <Bunny351> brutal simplicity and totally avoiding dependencies is the only way.
[00:09:16] <Bunny351> (external deps, that is)
[00:10:05] <Bunny351> oh and discipline, and appreciating experience. but I'm getting unrealistic, I know

[00:34:36] <siiky> having a program to check other programs, that is small/simple enough for you to be confident it's correct, would be a better step than faith or making all other programs small/simple
[00:38:29] <Bunny351> that "checking" program would necessarily be complex, could have bugs or make wrong assumptions. besides, if humans can barely check software to be marginally correct should give you an idea of how hard that problem actually is
[00:39:46] <Bunny351> what always surprises me, is how (for example) the formal program verification scene always blindly assume that the proof specs and proof machinery are correct.
[00:45:38] <siiky> why do you say that the checking program would be complex? semantic rules in general are simple; put a bunch of them together and you can get a pretty large area covered
[00:46:16] <siiky> and I'm not sure it's blindly assuming... but anyway, of course you can't know for sure, that's why I said "to be confident it's correct" (:
[00:46:41] <Bunny351> you must have found the holy grail, then
[00:47:39] <siiky> I haven't found anything yet, but I'll let you know if I ever do :D
[00:47:42] <Bunny351> what sort of semantic rules did you have in mind to give a reasonably good assumption of a program being "correct"?
[00:48:02] <Bunny351> and for what language? operating system?
[00:50:50] <siiky> I was thinking of a simple functional language (creating functions + creating atomic values + function application); you can cover a lot of ground with just that because a more complex program is just a more complex composition of those
[00:51:35] <siiky> I wasn't thinking of the "bare metal" (hardware + operating system), but there are tools for that too (though I haven't used any, so I can't say how good they are)
[00:53:01] <Corbin> Simply-typed lambda calculi are relatively safe by default; they're memory-safe and capability-safe, for example. We make them unsafe by adding features to languages.

[01:06:21] <siiky> just because there's no real useful (AFAIK) mainstream tool doesn't mean it's something impossible or an exceptionally hard problem... the majority of people don't fall on that side of the plate, so it's only natural it's not as advanced as other areas
[01:07:02] <siiky> luckily for everyone, sometimes cool people (e.g. you) make cool things (e.g. CHICKEN)!

[01:21:33] <Bunny351> well, I really appreciate that, but, considering what I have learned of how hard it is too even just translate correctly a (very simple) language into another (relatively simple language), I have my doubts that machine-assisted code checking can possibly work. you will never have true confidence, not remotely.

[05:56:31] <elflng> +1 bunny. i find the idea of automated code checking tools to be a massive step backwards.
[05:57:00] <elflng> the correct direction is to teach people to think and to recognise their own errors and pitfalls, not to try to substitute out human intelligence for computers
[05:57:20] <elflng> think, figure out the effects of ones actions...
[05:57:30] <elflng> its like when one plays chess, what i always try to hammer into my students...
[05:58:06] <elflng> to win, dont think about what you want to do - youll do that anyway. try to figure out what the other person wants to do. think about what theyre going to do because of what youre doing, not just how cool the thing is that youre doing.
[05:59:02] <Zipheir> "Then reduce the use of the brain and calculate!" (Dijkstra, responding to something similar to "don't try to substitute out human intelligence for computers")
[05:59:10] * elflng sighs.
[05:59:25] <Zipheir> A lot of progress in mathematics has been in replacing human calculation with machine computation.
[05:59:39] <Zipheir> You can't Euclid everything. :)
[05:59:44] <elflng> if one thinks adversarially to ones own code (or thoughts), one can discover bugs much faster and prevent errors.
[06:00:14] <elflng> a lot of progress in computational methodologies, not necessarily the same as progress in mathematics.
[06:00:32] <Zipheir> Sure.  But there's no reason to believe we'll always be better at that than computers.
[06:00:41] <elflng> sure there is.
[06:00:51] <elflng> one of the first perlis pearls, which i didnt appreciate until much later...
[06:01:03] <elflng> a year working in AI is enough to make anyone believe in G-d
[06:01:33] <Zipheir> Oh, I didn't mean AI specifically.
[06:01:38] <elflng> what we call 'ai' nowadays has no relation to traditional models of AI. its just improved search over many processors, ie, whats covered in teh first chapter of any AI book.
[06:01:45] <Zipheir> Much simpler algorithms, like provers.
[06:01:54] <elflng> provers are anything but simple
[06:01:59] <elflng> if one wants to do them in reasonable time
[06:02:13] <Zipheir> Simpler than strong AI, is of course what I meant.
[06:02:19] * elflng shrugs.
[06:02:59] <elflng> the only reason why most of these things work today is that computers have gotten fast and have a lot of memory. its the same brute force algos of 5 decades ago, only we have enough raw power that they seem reasonable.
[06:03:04] <elflng> the problem itself hasnt changed.
[06:03:51] <elflng> there have been very few algorithmic improvements over the last long bloody while
[06:04:21] <elflng> we're just happy that the tools work and that the computers are fast enough that we dont mind that theyre ugly hogs
[06:04:28] * elflng grumbles.
[06:04:50] <Zipheir> There's been an absolute ton of research in type theory, which is pretty relevant to automated program verification.
[06:05:20] <elflng> only for strong typed languages and only when things can be broken down by type. id love to see how relevant that is at an assembler level :)
[06:05:53] <elflng> i do have to go. i accidentally ate something with pineapple a few days ago - and i am deathly allergic to pineapple and am still dealing with side effects.
[06:06:03] <elflng> (see, mutation isnt the only thing that has side effects)
[06:06:06] <Zipheir> In any case, if you maintain there's some kind of error checking that humans can do that digital computers categorically can't do, the burden is to show why that's so--why are we such different machines?
[06:06:26] <elflng> what is the idea of idea?
[06:06:42] <elflng> first give the type or structure of what a thought itself is
[06:06:51] <elflng> and then we'll discuss why these are such different machines :)
[06:06:54] <elflng> afk
[06:08:05] <Zipheir> I suspect we have rather different ideas of hardware and wetware...
[06:11:55] <Zipheir> What thoughts are and whether they really correspond to some mental structure we have doesn't seem relevant to the question.  To me it's a fundamental question of what any physical computer--including brains and CPUs--can in principal compute.

[20:40:45] <mario-goulart> Ok.  Thanks for the update.
[20:43:25] <wasamasa> what's the deal with salmonella-freebsd-x86-64
[20:43:32] <wasamasa> did someone prune all the dependencies or config from it?
[20:43:45] <wasamasa> I'm getting failed installation notifications from it again
[20:43:58] <wasamasa> for example there's no cmake on it: http://salmonella-freebsd-x86-64.call-cc.org/salmonella/master/clang/freebsd/x86-64/2022/03/31/salmonella-report/install/kiwi.html
[20:45:37] <wasamasa> somehow I get a notification for inotify from the same runner, despite it being marked as skipped
[20:45:49] <mario-goulart> It got reinstalled.  Apparently some packages have not been dragged in as dependencies as something else.
[20:45:59] <mario-goulart> Thanks for the heads-up.  I'm gonna fix that.
[20:46:32] <mario-goulart> Oh, wait.  That's the FreeBSD machine.  That's teiresias'.
[20:46:41] <wasamasa> the gcc version of the runner fails with taglib, presumably because the libstdc++ and taglib have been compiled with incompatible compilers/ABIs
[20:46:51] <wasamasa> ah, so that may be why the change
