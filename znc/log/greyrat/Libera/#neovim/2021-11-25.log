The issue is that my text highlighting only works with some files. E.g. While editing my ~/.Xresources file, the editor highlights both comments/functions/etc - as it should - as well as the
[04:45:41] <sapere_aude> css color codes, as expected. Although, while editing my i3 config file, the editor highlights only the comments/functions/etc, but _not_ the css color codes. And finally, editing the polybar config file all text is white... Any ideas?

[11:45:33] <behelit> hey everyone! anyone know if it is possible to configure how lspconfig determines the `root_dir`? i often work with "monorepos" where there's a .git-directory in the root and each individual project has their own `requirements.txt` or `package.json`.
[11:45:49] <daniel[m]1234513> so I would create an autocommand that stores the most recent tabs in a stack or something on tabenter and another one that sets the current tab to the newly most recent on tabclosed if the closed tab was the most recent one

[11:46:51] <ii14[m]> though keep in mind that they don't have stable numbers
[11:47:26] <ii14[m]> I mean they are always a sequence of 1..N
[11:47:36] <clason[m]> behelit: yes, that's what the `root_dir` key in the setup is for
[11:47:45] <daniel[m]1234513> ok thank you!

[11:52:34] <behelit> clason[m]: just prioritizing `requirements.txt` or `package.json` over `.git` would suffice for my purposes.
[11:54:32] <clason[m]> yeah, that you can do
