[00:13:14] <pyzozord> I noticed one thing about that algorithm it guarantees that at n-1 position we have the max slice sum for that position, I think it uses that fact
[00:14:26] <pyzozord> Btw wikipedia page says that the guy who invented this algorithm took 1 minute to invent it. I already spent 5 hours trying to understand it
[00:14:27] <GeDaMo> pyzozord: have you tried it with all the numbers in the list being < 0 ?
[00:14:52] <pyzozord> GeDaMo: yeah it returns 0 incorrectly. Two lines need to be modified to make it work for all negative inputs
[00:15:22] <GeDaMo> You could set the two values to the first element
[00:16:48] <pyzozord> set two values to the first element?
[00:17:09] <GeDaMo> The current sum and best sum
[00:18:03] <GeDaMo> No, you'd still have to change the max(0, too
[00:18:10] <GeDaMo> ... I think
[00:19:04] <pyzozord> I read on the wiki page that you can change the initial max_slice to -Infinity and max(0, to max(x, then it works for inputs with all negatives

[00:21:01] <pyzozord> I discovered that this line adds elements essentially summing a slice, until the sum goes below 0 (or below x), then it kind of starts summing from the new place essentially creating another slice

[00:45:14] <pyzozord> i think that these puzzles may come in useful in reali life too. It's easy to imagine some data processing task where you need to find a subarray with maximum value

[00:45:57] <pyzozord> if you do you will end up with O(n)

[01:54:05] <karstensrage> [itchyjunk], this is how i would expect Java to be written, this is somewhat advanced so lets talk about the basics

[01:54:07] <bayaz> Title: View paste LEAA 
[01:54:28] <karstensrage> first be very conventional with Java always do the same thing
[01:54:47] <karstensrage> second its typical for all fields
[01:54:57] <karstensrage> you have getters and setters named CONVENTIONALLY for them
[01:55:16] <karstensrage> then you can add more methods for things you want to do
[01:55:52] <karstensrage> the elvis operator ?: is probably very advanced but its basically encapsulates if (true) then x else y
[01:55:58] <karstensrage> true?x:y
[01:56:56] <[itchyjunk]> oh i see. getCurrentState just returns the current value.
[01:56:57] <[itchyjunk]> hmm but
[01:57:17] <karstensrage> you can use something like https://www.jdoodle.com/online-java-compiler/
[01:57:31] <karstensrage> for an online repl that might be easier than whatever you are using locally
[01:57:37] <[itchyjunk]> with setCurrentState(int variable) shouldn't it be nameOfGlobalVariable = this.variable ?
[01:58:02] <karstensrage> in Java 'this' refers to the instance of the class you instantiated
[01:58:25] <karstensrage> there are no real globals per se
[01:58:30] <karstensrage> its a field of the class
[01:58:57] <karstensrage> so when you call that, this refers to the led = new Led() you created
[01:59:04] <karstensrage> it refers to led

[01:59:36] <karstensrage> led.setCurrentState(0);
[02:00:06] <[itchyjunk]> ah, this.currentState refers to the `field` currentState of my object `led`. if i had Led led 2 = new Led(), this.currentState would refer to the field currentState of my object led2
[02:00:19] <karstensrage> i would teach the java conventions first before even teaching programming because i see so many "java" programmers with really bad habits

[02:00:29] <karstensrage> yes exactly right
[02:00:38] <karstensrage> very good very good understanding
[02:01:07] <karstensrage> and they are not globals, each instance has their own "currentState"
[02:01:18] <Joanna> What happens if you don’t use “this “?
[02:02:03] <karstensrage> nothing, java figures it out but its not good practice
[02:02:21] <karstensrage> be explicit when you can be
[02:02:32] <karstensrage> if it doesnt help readability dont do it
[02:02:33] <Joanna> Oh
[02:02:41] <jeaye> Especially since it's common to to: void setFoo(Foo foo){ this.foo = foo; }
[02:02:57] <karstensrage> code as if the next person that sees your code is a serial killer that knows where you live

[02:10:53] <[itchyjunk]> basically, classes have getters, which i guess returns fields of that class in some capacity and setters which sets the fields of that class
[02:11:13] <karstensrage> yes
[02:11:23] <karstensrage> and any other methods you need for doing what you need to do

[04:19:46] <karstensrage> i mean in C you could just refer to anything as a pointer including data structures
[04:19:50] <beaky> yes though the specific type can vary according to definition for example something like a stack can either be recursively defined from an empty stack and a pushed element, or an 'abstract data type' with a set of operations over a carrier (which is more like a family of types)
[04:20:03] <karstensrage> in a strongly typed language then any structure would be typed
[04:20:04] *** Joins: mz` (~mz`@user/mz/x-8532539)
[04:22:37] <beaky> so taking java as an example you can define a stack adhoc as a class having a node, and nodes are recursively defined with an object and a 'next' property to another node, or an interface with operations like push, pop, etc. (like how it is done in the java collections library)

[08:59:06] <hexology> i just saw a line in a makefile recipe prefixed with "-", the way you'd prefix a line with "@" to suppress output. i've never seen this before and i don't see it in the gnu manual. when i run `make -n` the "-" is stripped, suggesting that this is indeed valid gnu make syntax and not just an executable with "-" in the name. does anyone know what that syntax means?

[11:21:47] <password> because programmers can't choose a secure password ?

I was wondering, when there is an interrupt driven I/O architecture - then generally, when a peripheral initiates an interrupt over IRQ to the CPU - there is no OS kernel stuff being executed at this very moment, correct? The OS stuff generally happens after the CPU receives the interrupt and does some further work. What I am trying to get

[16:57:34] <bjs> pyzozord: that's where O comes from yes.
[16:59:54] <bjs> pyzozord: remember that O(n) does not mean that an algorithm takes n steps for an input of size n. It might take 5n+12log(n)+17 steps or whatever. But we say it's of "order n", because as the input gets very big the other bits stop being important and it starts to look like just n (or rather constant*n)

[18:48:03] <[itchyjunk]> I think i'll try to do this fizzbuzz challange actually! later today that is
[18:48:06] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: you can write programs in Python/Java/whatever using classes and objects without ever using inheritance and it's still OOP.
[18:48:21] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: it's not really a challenge, it's supposed to be a 3 line program just to check if the person has actually ever used a programming language before

[18:49:02] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: "Here you claim you can program, can you write a program to loop through some numbers and print them out?"
[18:49:07] <[itchyjunk]> right, classes makes oop. though its unclear as to why not just write the functions out somewhere instead of `methods` in a class. since functions are reusable anyways

[18:54:27] <sjmulder> I've played much of the Achtronics games, they're crack to me
[18:54:35] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: most OOP languages like having a "class" thing to let you add structure. So you know that all "Led" objects have the same attributes and look the same and such, but it's really just convenience;  the important thing is the object and the attributes and methods it has.
[18:54:42] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: that's why it's not "Inheritance-orientated programming" or "Class-orientated programming" it's "_Object_ orientated programming"

[19:00:08] <karstensrage> its not entirely true that Java doesnt have multiple inheritance, you can extends only one thing, but you can implement any number of interfaces, since Java 8 interfaces can have default implementations so there are multiple inheritance rules associated with that

[19:17:48] <sjmulder> I'd look at how inheritance is used in real programming: e.g. a Widget superclass to Button and TextField etc, because they all need to implement common windget behaviour

[19:17:56] <bayaz> Title: What Is Inheritance? (The Java™ Tutorials > Learning the Java Language > Object-Oriented Programming Concepts) 
[19:18:06] <karstensrage> for example for your question, you start talking about domain expertise and maybe youre Mammal class only has properties like fur and feeds young with milk
[19:18:16] <karstensrage> then platypus is fine extending from mammal
[19:18:28] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: these examples are always very silly because you have like 1 object and 2-3 classes and it all seems very pointless
[19:18:39] <karstensrage> but that might requiure a complete rearchitecture if your domain wasnt clearly specified at the outset
[19:18:47] <langstme> sjmulder, exactly. Start with looking at UI frameworks, there´s a lot of OOP to learn there
[19:18:51] <[itchyjunk]> ah
[19:19:12] <[itchyjunk]> UI sounds harder though, no?
[19:19:17] <karstensrage> [itchyjunk], remember yesterday i talked about what a POJO is?
[19:19:28] <sjmulder> langstme, I feel that's also one of the few places where inheritance really makes sense. in most other places interfaces/protocols/traits are better abstractions

[19:20:06] <[itchyjunk]> uhh plain old java object. i can't remember exactly what it was. it only had the bare minimum stuff in it?
[19:20:14] <karstensrage> [itchyjunk], also remember that not every problem is a nail, different methodologies can be applied that might suit certain types of problems better than others
[19:20:21] <karstensrage> there is no one methodology to rule them all
[19:20:25] <[itchyjunk]> right
[19:20:51] <karstensrage> right, so in DDD Domain Driven Design, the POJO is an anti-pattern
[19:21:12] <karstensrage> so even though they are super common, in some methodolgies they are "bad"
[19:21:33] <langstme> sjmulder, agreed. I barely use inheritance, and if I do it´s always only one level deep.

[19:28:57] <sjmulder> langstme, when you strip it down to the essentials much logic is data transformation or computation, processes that take input and deliver output

[19:31:40] <langstme> sjmulder, I think I mostly do something similar. I mainly do backend programming, but still need my structures to vaguely resemble domain objects.
[19:31:50] <[itchyjunk]> an `interface` is defined within a class ? And when i want a new class to user this other class to set itself up `implements`, i set up the `interface` stuff by giving the right values?
[19:32:15] <sandman13> langstme: I think that's what Lisp does. You might find it interesting xD
[19:32:25] <Guest2857> You mean Lithp.
[19:33:38] <sjmulder> [itchyjunk], an interface is a list of methods and such. a class can declare it supports that interface and must then implement those methods
[19:33:40] <langstme> sandman13, that keeps popping up now and then. Might have to go ahead and take a better look at Clojure
[19:34:03] <sjmulder> after that, you can pass objects of that class to anywhere the interface is required

[19:50:46] <Guest2857> Yeah, but not in the core language though, is it?
[19:51:01] <sjmulder> also you can write object oriented code in C, look at Core Foundation for example

[19:56:58] <kmh> or associatuve arrays
[19:57:00] <sjmulder> or maps
[19:57:07] <davros>  hashtable is a specific implementation of the functionality
[19:57:07] <kmh> yep
[19:57:34] <sjmulder> although when going abroad don't assume a dictionary is also a map
[19:57:40] <acinonyx___> if anybody has a latest Firefox, can they run `console.log(Array.from(document.querySelectorAll("div")).map(x => x.offsetLeft))` in the console with any non-trivial HTML file which has many `div`s?
[19:57:44] <Guest2857> I call it an array. :D
[19:57:44] <Guest2857> 
[19:57:48] <davros> rust calls it 'hashmap' , because its a 'map (ie associative array)' implemented as a hashtable
[19:58:00] <Guest2857> There's BTreeMap as well.
[19:58:03] <davros> by contrast c++ std::map i think is a sorted tree of somesort
[19:58:10] <[itchyjunk]> map as in like f:a->b ?
[19:58:24] <Guest2857> Yup. unordered_map is the equivalent of HashMap.
[19:58:33] <davros> array is specifically ordered ascending keys usualy starting at zero.. ie a simple sequential array in memory
[19:58:55] <Guest2857> Yes, with the indices as the keys, and the contents as the contents :D
[19:59:03] <biberao> hi
[19:59:04] <davros> map f:a->b is kind of related in that both are a mapppping of input to output, however a function is very differnt to a datastructure
[19:59:07] <Guest2857> Hola
[19:59:09] <kmh> davros,  without the associative part
[19:59:43] <[itchyjunk]> oh i see. so with array i get arrayt[0] = value but with dictionary i get dictionary[key] = value?
[19:59:48] <davros> 'a hashtable is one of several ways of implementing an associative array' (and happens to be popular for good reasons)
[19:59:50] <[itchyjunk]> seems about the same to me :s

[22:08:07] <pyzozord> I feel like many intuitions are universal and objective, or at least they are presented as such in texts

[22:18:53] <bjs> so the idea of "flipping" doesn't even apply as an intuition at all, and perhaps to you the idea of the things not even being numbers might be totally foreign as a concept entirely

[22:21:37] <bjs> pyzozord: you can't say it's objectively more intuitive because *I* personally find the other interpretation more intuitive and captures better what it really is and is applicable in many more circumstances
[22:21:58] <bjs> and to me the x/y => y/x is just an artefact of how we write fractions

[22:46:20] <bjs> pyzozord: i'm very unconvinced that hiding the definition somewhere in the middle would make it more accessible. Maybe to people who are very "early in their mathematical careers" let's say might get benefit from skipping the definition
[22:46:34] <bjs> but by the time you take any class in math you kind of need the definition
[22:46:39] <user51> i actually leanred that thing about exponents maybe two weeks ago.. the general rule seems fine, but it was nice to know how it actually maps to
[22:46:39] <bjs> (and up)

[22:47:38] <bjs> It seems very unclear to me that they're the target audience for such a page, but sure you can probably do something to get the page changed if you think it'd help
[22:47:42] <bjs> I don't know the wiki process
[22:47:42] <pyzozord> and catering to them (without decreasing any value for experts) seems like a good idea, raising overall level for everybody
