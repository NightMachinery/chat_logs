[00:52:41] <tomreyn> webchat70: so you should now be in the position to capture and post two system logs: one of  the system with graphical output, and one without graphical output, those could then be compared (by yourself, or someone you can convince to help you do so).
[00:52:53] <webchat70> tomreyn well true, but as the first paragraph of my self-support ticket stays: I wont open a bug report on launchpad with some creepy gathered knowledge. That is why I use this as a starting ground, in high hopes to not be a burden on the devs and annoy them on launchpad with them explaining me the basics what they need
[00:53:24] <tomreyn> that's a good approach for sure.

[02:00:07] <nemo> surely there's a magic "gimme the source package" command ☺

[07:55:30] <guiverc> Ubuntu flavors are all Ubuntu, but have a different desktop on top; eg. Lubuntu is standard Ubuntu with the LXQt desktop replacing GNOME (used by Ubuntu Desktop), Xubuntu uses the XFCE ... ie. only use Ubuntu repository packages downloaded from ubuntu etc

[07:59:23] <kongzilla> storage space is finite, so no, not infinite
[07:59:27] <guiverc> infinite no (you'll run out of space eventually; and partition-tables have limits), but limits are rarely reached

[08:00:38] <kongzilla> you can do a lot with docker or qemu
[08:00:53] <anonymous> Does that expand the limitations surrounding partitions?
[08:01:12] <anonymous> I've got a triboot now - seems to work fine. I have been told that if I use UEFI / GPT - then I can get more
[08:02:21] <kongzilla> MBR tables only support up to 4 primary partitions
[08:02:55] <anonymous> Thank you Kongzilla - So that would mean 4 Operating systems, or/
[08:03:18] <kongzilla> I think it all comes down to what you're trying to accomplish
[08:03:43] <guiverc> I had 11 or 13 installed on a pentium 4 test box (using only MBR); you can use an extended partition on MBR which can then be subdivided into more... It's 4 primary partitions (not 4 in total)
[08:03:56] <anonymous> I'd love to install Mint, Kodachi, Qubes, BlackArch, Windows 10, and a few others
[08:04:00] <anonymous> WOW!

[08:07:46] <anonymous> haha k
[08:07:58] <anonymous> Hey Kong - please check your other messsages
[08:08:20] <guiverc> G34, the partition scheme is dependant on how you'll use it ; simple is usually best; /boot and /boot/efi are not the same thing usually
[08:08:28] <anonymous> I didn't realize Ubuntu / Linux could use ram as swap!
[08:08:41] <kongzilla> lol... what?
[08:08:44] <anonymous> I always thought it had to be encrypted partitions on drive itself.
[08:08:55] <G34> Guiverc i need boot efi for my notherboard
[08:09:08] <kongzilla> you're putting swap in ram? like a swap file in tmpfs? why?
[08:09:11] <G34> So i then don't need onky boot?
[08:09:25] <anonymous> More secure?
[08:09:41] <guiverc> G34, I probably misread what you meant, I took it as boot/efi (boot or efi) and not /boot/efi/ (ie. uEFI partition)
[08:09:45] <guiverc> Sorry

[08:10:36] <G34> Yeah, i meant this way guiverc
[08:11:06] <G34> Swap
[08:11:10] <anonymous> kongzilla,  I have tried to install Linux Distros without a swap partition - but it never works. Maybe I don't install correctly? Is it merely a matter of NOT creating a swap file? I still encrypt the swap anyways
[08:11:28] *** Joins: yukiup (~yukiup@2601:647:4600:b930:6184:a4f7:55ee:dd51)
[08:11:28] <G34> Darn all slashes went away
[08:11:36] <guiverc> G34, /boot/efi is required for uEFI boxes yep.  you can then use / for rest; server users tend to want specific partition schemes; for desktop there is little to be gained usually
[08:11:54] <kongzilla> swap isn't required
[08:12:02] <anonymous> Interesting...
[08:12:03] <anonymous> I had no idea!
[08:12:28] <anonymous> So it is the / partition that you want to (generally) make the largest then?
[08:12:30] <G34> Guiverc even when upgrading? How do you keep files intact if everything is on /

[08:12:37] <anonymous> Home can be smaller for storing files ?
[08:13:05] <G34> Plus, can i use askubuntu for kubuntu questions?
[08:13:28] <guiverc> G34, Ubuntu installers allow you to install over where only system directories are erased (selected if you don't format) so seperated /home isn't required - but I often still have it (don't usually if encryption is used to keep it simple)
[08:13:39] <kongzilla> anonymous: /home is generally the largest, depending on your needs
[08:13:55] <anonymous> Wow you are all teaching me so much
[08:14:14] <anonymous> So you don't need two separate partitions (home and /)?
[08:14:18] <anonymous> You can merge them into one?
[08:14:23] <G34> Oh great guiverc
[08:14:28] <G34> Thanks!
[08:15:14] <kongzilla> it is not required to have any more than one partition

[11:23:07] <nikolam> What's the reccomendation OS on a long term for 32-bit machine, for a small server? I have one Asus EeePC 701, pu 2GB RAM in it, 4GB flash, have 32GB SSD, 3USB 2.0 ports, 100Mbit LAN (will put Gigabit LAN on USB) as well as at least 2 additional higher capacity drives on 2 USB ports. What would be OS that I can count of being supported for small server use (mail server etc.) , since everyone is moving away form 32-bit..?
[11:23:23] <nikolam> 32GB SD sorry
[11:24:10] <nikolam> Used to have previously installed Ubuntu server minimal, were harder to install but it worked, now I dunno..

[12:49:41] <alkisg> E.g. if that wpa_supplicant message shows up in both cases, it wouldn't be the cause of the issue
[12:49:47] <TJ-> Looks like the version of hostapd I'm running on the AP is sending IEs not known to the version of wpa_supplicant on the client!
[12:49:48] <alkisg> Btw, any special characters in the SSID?
[12:50:02] <TJ-> alkisg: nothing as easy as that, unfortunately!

[12:52:56] <TJ-> to add to the misery, it has a single USB3.0 port which is partially broken from the PCB and VERY flakey so attaching an external Ethernet adapter is hit-and-miss. Been meaning to open the T300CHI and repair it for about 2 years now :D
[12:53:36] <alkisg> I'm just worried that even after upgrading wpa_supplicant, it won't work, and another thing would be the issue; you could test with a live cd if you're not planning to upgrade it otherwise...
[12:53:57] <alkisg> Actually, live usb + chroot + upgrade might be faster than offline upgrade
[12:54:04] <TJ-> it'll be upgraded to 20.04 at least; everthing else is on 20.04 currently
[12:54:16] <TJ-> alkisg: the challenge there is the poorly USB port :)

[14:22:27] <neurochrome> Hey folks!  Since installing the latest kernel updates on 16.04, my nvidia drivers no longer work.  I get to the login screen but everything is huge.  Sometimes it just fully locks up, other times I can login but things are seriously messed up.  If I try and open nvidia-settings then it's just blank.
[14:22:43] <lotuspsychje> kieto: i recently noticed some high cpu on FF without reason, still investigating that myself
[14:22:46] <neurochrome> I can boot into the old kernel ok.
[14:23:08] <kieto> lotuspsychje: cool, then I'm not alone :P
[14:23:25] <neurochrome> I've tried purging nvidia packages and re-installing.  I also tried reinstalling the latest kernel too.  No joy. Any ideas?
[14:23:37] <lotuspsychje> neurochrome: 16.04 is end of life, reccomended to install a supported version from topic

[14:37:43] <tuxick> hmm, desktop 2004 installer kinda confusing me, why is "new partition table" disabled?
[14:38:02] <tuxick> i really don't like the default lvm "give everything to root"
[14:38:44] <tuxick> ah
[14:39:21] * ogra does not think we had LVM support in the installer from 2004 ... 
[14:39:38] <ogra> 😛
[14:39:41] <tuxick> h0h0
[14:40:04] <tuxick> ok, it refuses to deal with new partition because of existing installation

Sometimes it locks up at this screen, other times I can login but the OS is slow and frequently locks up.  nvidia-settings show a blank page when I try to open it once logged in.  I can still use the previous kernel without issue.  I've tried purging nvidia

[16:38:48] <tomreyn> "The login screen is super low res and huge." sounds like the nvidia driver did not load properly. logs should help analyze this. dmesg is a command to capture the kernel-only logs from the kernel logging ring buffer and output them.

[16:40:35] <tomreyn> if you'd like to also include other logs, you'd use    journalctl -b | nc termbin.com 9999    instead. for logs from the previous boot, you'd use   journalctl -b -1 | nc termbin.com 9999
[16:41:14] <tomreyn> to limit that to only kernel logs, add -k before -b

[17:20:25] <tomreyn> Modulo5k: you should probably specify architecture also, not just bitness. most support for x86 (if it refers to this) was removed with 19.10 and 20.04 LTS. https://ubuntu.com/blog/statement-on-32-bit-i386-packages-for-ubuntu-19-10-and-20-04-lts

[17:24:53] <tomreyn> you just need to read up on it ;)

[23:44:40] <tomreyn> you have multiple processes failing with "bad page map" errors. this usually points to bad RAM.
