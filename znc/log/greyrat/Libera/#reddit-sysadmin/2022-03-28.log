[02:42:40] <CableNinja> yuken, first one, this huge old dog that was always outside and jumpin on the garage roof barkin at us, broke through their shittily maintained fence and b-lined straight for us
[02:42:56] <CableNinja> second one, dipshit owner walking 60lb dog with no leash
[02:43:17] <CableNinja> you know who ends up taking all the fucking bites and scuffs? ME goddammit
[02:43:33] <CableNinja> owners are always 2 minutes later 'oh god oh jeeze' morty style
[02:45:06] <rpifan> daylight savings time is fucking me up
[02:45:13] <rpifan> feel like its an hour before
[02:45:42] <CableNinja> my sleep schedule has been hosed anyway, DST just compounded it
[02:45:52] <CableNinja> last night I was up until 3:30a, and then woke up at 1p
[02:46:10] <yuken> CableNinja, I've legitimately thought about how a situation like that would be handled by the police, if someone shot or otherwise killed someone's dog that ran out of a fenced area here. 
[02:46:20] <CableNinja> yeah its bullshit
[02:46:31] <CableNinja> of course, if I let my dog have at them, he'll get put down
[02:46:37] <yuken> Mhmm.
[02:46:51] <CableNinja> and its always been the other dog thats the agressor
[02:46:55] <rpifan> i wish we'd just stick to one time zone
[02:47:02] <rpifan> but here in the north of europe its really hard
[02:47:07] <yuken> You can't really run away from a moderately sized dog unless they're old as shit either, CableNinja. They can sprint faster than us, and running triggers their chase instincts!
[02:47:12] <rpifan> the summer are soooo long and the winters so short, day time wise
[02:47:14] <riff_IRC> EOL'd a dog that broke out from behind a crappy fence backk in 1992
[02:47:15] <rpifan> its hard to just pick one
[02:47:17] <yuken> So you basically have to sit there and hope they don't attack you, or attack them back if they do.
[02:47:23] <yuken> Pretty much SoL if some shitty owner lets their dog out.
[02:47:26] <CableNinja> today,  Ihad my dog short leashed, and was stopping him from doing anything, their dogs just yappin a storm and whirling out of their leash and shes not making it any harder by holding the leash upright so the dog can just slip out
[02:47:46] <riff_IRC> 80mph 2-lane, random dog runs out of NOWHERE right in front of my truck (which had 10 tons connected to it)
[02:47:59] <rpifan> ouch
[02:48:01] <CableNinja> oof :(
[02:48:23] <CableNinja> I did that to a cat a couple years back, I felt terrible. I tried to call the nearest vet and animal control but no one would answer. I left it :(
[02:48:27] <rpifan> did you brake or just keep going
[02:48:34] <rpifan> i mean breaking with that weight and speed would be worse
[02:48:43] <CableNinja> I stopped just in front of the cat, but the stupid shit decided to dart between the front and back tires last second
[02:49:04] <riff_IRC> saw a glimpse of a dog, then *KATHUNKTHUDTHUMP* as it rolled between my truck and the road
[02:49:32] <CableNinja> oof
[02:49:40] <riff_IRC> didn't even try to stop before hitting it, just swerved a hair so it would go out quickly and painlessly
[02:50:38] <rpifan> its really horrible
[02:50:52] <rpifan> but at that speed and weight if you stopped immediately there would have probably been more deaths
[02:51:03] <rpifan> i mean imagine a driverless truck having to make thsoe decisions
[02:51:09] <Oliber> animals be dumb, owners need to understand that and not let them go places if they don't want them pancaked; in the UK there is legislation that puts that in to law for owners must have control over their dog if near a road.  but no matter the laws, it feels like shit to kill someone's fiend
[02:51:10] <riff_IRC> and given that the fence it ran out from was "hiding" a house that looked like it was abandoned sometime around the Korean War (and the road frequently had 100mph+ traffic on it), I just kept going- nobody to get ahold of and dangerous to stop
[02:51:37] <CableNinja> Oliber, yep, wish they had that here too. the dogs that just attacked me crossed the road of course
[02:52:26] <CableNinja> Oliber, yeah, I'd feel bad, but I would've absolutely punted this dog to space with my steel toes if I had the chance
[02:52:35] <CableNinja> that dog would not have survived my kick, guaranteed
[02:52:53] <estranger> lol @ EOLd 
[02:53:27] <CableNinja> goddam what a shitty fucking way to start my day :|
[02:53:42] <CableNinja> I bet the bitch doesnt even come by to apologize later. she knows where I live
[02:53:57] <Oliber> dangerous dogs are also legislated, if the owner allows the dog to be agressive, they can be fined or dog sized
[02:54:15] <CableNinja> Oliber, too bad 'dangerous dogs' here gets applied by breed and not individually
[02:54:17] <Oliber> sorry, "dog to be dangerously out of control"

[04:21:20] <yuken> it's basically round, CableNinja - and, I can not use uhhh...
[04:21:27] <yuken> a mallet + screwdriver, that might bend/break stuff.

[09:45:39] <JollyRgrs> xe0n: lol
[09:45:41] <JollyRgrs> doubt it
[09:45:48] <SirSceptalot> looks like I don't keep up with celebrities enough. First I had to look up why will was angry, now I don't know what xe0n is talking about
[09:45:49] <JollyRgrs> i think he was just "acting"
[09:46:01] <JollyRgrs> i mean... not acting as in being upset... but acting as in trying to act like a big man
[09:46:29] <xe0n> his wife was banging her son's friends...
[09:46:35] <yuken> SirSceptalot, check this out. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNc9PosUJcA
[09:46:42] <yuken> SirSceptalot, I just came across this and this man is a god damn genius.
[09:46:45] <yuken> Look at that trigger mechanism.
[09:46:58] <JollyRgrs> he used to make awesome summer blockbusters (id4, MIB, etc.) and then washed out... then tried to go all soft... wasn't horrible, but... yeah... i think he's really become "nothing" except media gossip
[09:47:33] <JollyRgrs> SirSceptalot: they have a SUPER public "open relationship"
[09:47:37] <xe0n> ^
[09:47:40] <SirSceptalot> ah
[09:47:42] <JollyRgrs> in fact, the entire world has told them to STFU about it
[09:47:54] <JollyRgrs> but they keep talking about it
[09:48:05] <SirSceptalot> never heard about it
[09:48:14] <xe0n> clearly dont have have bing news set as home page :P
[09:48:15] <JollyRgrs> so tonight will tried to act like the "big man" and stand up for his wife
[09:48:20] <JollyRgrs> xe0n++
[09:48:33] <JollyRgrs> even though at first, he chuckled at the joke
[09:48:39] <xe0n> "haha, oh wait..."
[09:48:53] <JollyRgrs> so my ? is... was it jada that had a problem with it, or did it dawn on him he should say something about it?
[09:48:55] <JollyRgrs> yeah
[09:49:18] <monr0e> wait up, will smith and his missus are in an open relationship?
[09:49:20] <JollyRgrs> "wait, she's not filming for gi jane 2... what?"
[09:49:28] <SirSceptalot> I mean, it wasn't like he said "haha your wife is bald"
[09:49:55] <SirSceptalot> maybe he had too look up the joke on his phone first, like I did :p
[09:49:55] <xe0n> he's still upset about wild wild west
[09:50:00] <xe0n> wild wild will, will smith, desperato
[09:50:11] <JollyRgrs> considering it is VERY common for black women to wear hair extentions ALL THE TIME... is it really that big of a deal for her? tbh, it'd be much worse if she were white (white women can't get away w/ wearing weave all the time)
[09:50:34] <JollyRgrs> hey now, you came awfully close to saying will smith and desperado in the same sentence
[09:50:38] <JollyRgrs> desperado was good movie
[09:50:45] <SirSceptalot> I do get that it's different if it's forced due to illness though
[09:50:49] <JollyRgrs> don't taint it with will smith
[09:50:57] <JollyRgrs> SirSceptalot: yeah... i mean, it was kind of not the best joke
[09:51:11] <JollyRgrs> i would expect someone to say something after the fact on twitter or in person, etc.
[09:51:34] <JollyRgrs> but not litterally walk on stage at the oscars, slap him in the face, then "FU" all over him after sitting back down

[11:28:14] <CableNinja> SirSceptalot, yeah, I'm all good I think. happened next to a firestation. asked them for a gauze pad to get home. he said it looked alright just some hot water and peroxide
[11:28:28] <yuken> Incubation period can be a long time, and could potentially reach a point of spreading before visible symptoms show - could take awhile for anyone to realise, and the dog could accidentally get vaccinated in the mean time and no one ever knew.
[11:28:32] <yuken> ANd then you die 3-4 years later of rabies.
[11:28:58] <xe0n> why wouldn't it mitchy...
[11:29:03] <yuken> Dog has rabies, but it hasn't started. Dog bites you, you get rabies. Dog gets rabies vaccine before it reaches brain, rabies never infects the brain. You don't, you notice symptoms years later, you die.
[11:29:14] <yuken> So get a rabies shot, CableNinja.
[11:29:44] <yuken> It's still very common, we just don't have many deaths in the US because of the rabies shot plus fewer people interacting with wild animals as often, compared to the past (or in developing nations).
[11:31:39] <CableNinja> eh, from what I know the dog was a rescue so its been through its shit, and my dog just got his shots again last year.. I 'probably' should, but given the other shit thats yet to kill me...

[11:39:13] <yuken> CableNinja, get a rabies shot. 
[11:39:22] <yuken> It's like 2-3 shots, in the butt. You barely notice it.
[11:39:24] <SirSceptalot> now i'm wondering if they just made fake xrays or if they went to their local hospitals and said "yo doc..."
[11:39:41] <CableNinja> I'm pretty sure those were real pictures

[11:40:34] <CableNinja> dude I have to do so much other shit to go get a rabies shot.. like... damn... if I do have it I'll be dead by the time I can get a shot for it
[11:40:50] <yuken> CableNinja, rabies has what amounts to a 100% kill rate without treatment, and basically 99.9999999999% with treatment.
[11:40:52] <CableNinja> lost my insurance cards, havent decided to deal with that yet
[11:40:56] <yuken> I think... 1 person has really survived, and 7 people have "survived"
[11:40:59] <yuken> (AKA. complete vegetables)
[11:41:21] <xe0n> no shot, dog bite
[11:41:35] <yuken> CableNinja, it's more common than you think, and dogs can carry it for weeks before showing symptoms while simultaneously being able to spread it.
[11:41:39] <xe0n> woof woof not bang bang
[11:41:51] <yuken> There's an open window where they have the virus in their mouth, but not their brain - so no symptoms or anything.
[11:42:02] *** Joins: interop_madness (~interop_m@user/interop-madness/x-0950004)
[11:42:14] <yuken> And if you wait 2-3 weeks for the dog to show symptoms, that's enough time that it could be too late for you as well, CableNinja. So while it is very uncommon... get a fucking rabies shot.
[11:42:25] <yuken> It's 2-3 shots that cost basically nothing. The CDC even recommends this, heavily.
[11:42:36] <CableNinja> if the dogs got rabies it'd be dead already
[11:42:41] <yuken> No, it wouldn't.
[11:42:53] <yuken> Even a small dog can host rabies for weeks before symptoms show.

[11:43:21] <sd> 07<S​trongBad> Isn't it dehydration that does it?
[11:43:25] <xe0n> just wait for the bleeding out of the ass
[11:43:25] <CableNinja> again... it wasnt a stray dog, it was someones dog from their house. so if said dog even had rabies it'd be dead by now because I've seen that dog for months
[11:43:26] <yuken> If she has some aggressive, knappy dog that gets off its leash CableNinja - do you think it hasn't, say... gone after a dog?
[11:43:36] <xe0n> yeah...and the vet would've put it down

[11:43:46] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> @StrongBad Rabies kills you by melting your brain.
[11:43:48] <xe0n> umm..small dogs do that all the time.

[11:45:06] <sd> 07<S​trongBad> Yeah
[11:45:19] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Your throat closes up because the virus wants you to salivate, as it's solely transferred via saliva or brain matter.

[11:45:34] <sd> 07<S​trongBad> Viruses are such a trip
[11:45:41] <sd> 07<S​trongBad> Technically not alive right

[11:45:59] <sd> 07<S​trongBad> I don't really understand how they're not alive but whatever
[11:46:08] <xe0n> ice, clean it, bandage\cover, rinse repeat, bruise will come up eventually
[11:46:11] <xe0n> and then you've got a story
[11:46:12] <xe0n> ta da
[11:46:17] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> @StrongBad Basically - if you get bitten by an animal on your hand, it can take years to spread to your brain. The longset documented case was 8 years for rabies. But, by the time you notice rabies symptoms, you're already dead.
[11:46:35] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Since that means it's reached your brain. It attacks your fear center, which makes you irrationally afraid of everything. And I mean fear worse than anything you've felt in your life.
[11:46:42] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Ran straight into gunfire? This fear is worse.
[11:46:56] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> There's essentially no natural way to experience the fear rabies gives you without the aid of serious drugs.
[11:47:01] <sd> 08<c​ritamine> But if you get bit, and promptly go to the doctor to get checked... you'll be ok, right?
[11:47:05] <sd> 07<S​trongBad> Sounds awful
[11:47:07] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> If you get your shots, yes.
[11:47:14] <sd> 07<S​trongBad> Yeah get the vaccine immediately
[11:47:16] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Rabies vaccine post-bite has never failed iirc.
[11:47:17] <xe0n> nah, CableNinja is gonna lose his hand
[11:47:20] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> 100% efficiency rate so far.
[11:47:23] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> xe0n, not hand. Death.
[11:47:25] <xe0n> gonna have to dragon dictate moving forward
[11:47:44] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> It's a 100% death rate, minus 1 individual who we think has a genetic component to their partial immunity.
[11:47:48] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> And they were still severely brain damaged afterwards.
[11:48:00] <sd> 07<S​trongBad> I've heard to test for rabies they have to decapitate the animal
[11:48:00] <xe0n> prob a good time to ignore sd guys...
[11:48:03] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Yeah, the odds of it are low. But it _still exists and is common in the US_.
[11:48:14] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> It doesn't exist in Australia, which is why you don't give a shit.
[11:48:20] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Because it never mattered down there, so it was never part of your culture.
[11:48:24] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Rabies is serious shit here for any farm kid.
[11:48:50] <xe0n> what? um we have rabies...
[11:48:58] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> You didn't last time I checked.

[11:49:07] <xe0n> not domestic lol
[11:49:21] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Nope, rabies doesn't occur in Australia according to your government.
[11:49:26] <xe0n> nice
[11:49:37] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Which is probably why you don't give a shit about it, because it was never beaten into your head.

[15:11:11] <Activ8> dunno what's up today but for some reason our companies we deal with have got major projects going on
[15:11:30] <Activ8> a lot of them never bothered to schedule anything with us now there's an influx of tickets come in
[15:11:49] <Activ8> I have logged 35 tickets this morning.  I feel like an admin assistant and not a sysadmin
[15:12:04] <Activ8> 1 of the tickets - someones stole the domain, Previous CEO.  
[15:12:08] <Activ8> fucking mint!
[15:13:26] <riff-IRC> Sounds like someone didn't deactivate accounts
[15:13:48] <Activ8> not our responsibility
[15:14:22] <Activ8> also no - the CEO of the company has fucked everyone over.... not good.
[15:14:38] <Activ8> did a runner and handed over the duties to a new ceo without telling him he took everything.
[15:14:39] <riff-IRC> ouch
[15:15:14] <riff-IRC> had a guy one time get fired from a company where we maintained a generator installation
[15:15:32] <riff-IRC> the generator had one of those multi-tap stators with selectable voltages
[15:15:44] <riff-IRC> between 480V and 132kV
[15:20:13] <monr0e> I don't like where that story is going
[15:22:04] <riff-IRC> The generator control system was equipped with the out-of-band management kit, which included a dial-up line, and it was also equipped with a domain controller integration kit, which allowed it to sync credentials from an (at the time) Windows 2000 domain controller
[15:22:07] <Activ8> why do companies insist in doing things all in one go without scheduling changes - so many fucks up waiting to happen, and is happening.
[15:22:31] <riff-IRC> Guy gets fired and someone forgets to disable his account.
[15:23:08] <Activ8> oh dear
[15:23:17] <Activ8> that's a prosecution waiting to happen
[15:23:22] <Activ8> if they have the logs
[15:24:08] <riff-IRC> One night, he logs into the generator control system using his administrator account, modifies the config to select the 132kV tap (nominal voltage 4160V), locks out all other voltage taps, and then locks out the utility feed.
[15:24:45] <Activ8> fuck
[15:26:48] <riff-IRC> So a nominally 4160V system suddenly gets 132,000V (more than 31x nominal voltage) shoved down it
[15:28:22] <sd> 13<C​olour> : |
[15:28:48] <riff-IRC> The generator system runs like this for several seconds before everything goes to hell and it's forced to trip offline due to an overload. By that point, everything's already gone up in smoke.
[15:29:16] <riff-IRC> That building burned to the ground less than an hour later.
[15:29:31] <monr0e> any repercussions?
[15:30:10] <riff-IRC> The guy that got fired? Charges were filed, but he vanished from the face of the planet and was never found.

[17:41:29] <DrGibbysWifi> How was yours?
[17:41:34] <SirSlapsalot> vinrock, because never in the history of mankind has some dude lost his shit and done something impulsive which might not have been the best idea given hindsight?
[17:41:35] <PublicWiFi> Good! My new drumset came in :D

[17:42:12] <DrGibbysWifi> MACCAS are you a drummer?!
[17:42:15] <PublicWiFi> yeeeee
[17:42:21] <vinrock> SirSlapsalot, you're equating the circumstances and people involved with your average joe schmoe in a common setting
[17:42:22] <PublicWiFi> well, I haven't played in a few years soI'm getting back into it!
[17:42:30] <vinrock> these were hollywood actors on stage being broadcast to the nation
[17:42:34] <DrGibbysWifi> What trap set did you get?!
[17:42:49] <CptLuxx> fucking fortios 7.0.5
[17:42:52] <PublicWiFi> i went Electronic unfortunately :(
[17:42:54] <CptLuxx> when will they ever fix there memory leaks
[17:42:59] <PublicWiFi> but I nabbed a TD-17KVX
[17:43:11] <JollyRgrs> vinrock: i questioned that, too... but tbh, will smith has not been a great actor... he played a lot of cool roles in summer blockbusters... i haven't seen king richard, but many were surprised he won that catagory
[17:43:30] <vinrock> hey im not judging his acting chops im just sayin
[17:43:31] <JollyRgrs> so... can will smith act THAT good? and if Chris knew that was coming... he sure had balls of steel by not flinching in the least
[17:43:34] <PublicWiFi> its been good so far, I haven't played an electronic set this much before
[17:43:36] <vinrock> the dude needs a boost and so does the show
[17:43:38] <SirSlapsalot> I dunno. I'm not going to bet on it being real or fake, but I feel that if they wanted to do a publicity stunt they could have chosen better than having an "idol" commit senseless violence on a live show and then censoring it for the nation in which it's made
[17:43:46] <vinrock> vontroversy sells
[17:43:50] <JollyRgrs> i think the reason Chris took it so well is b/c he wasn't expecting it and was in shock like "did that just happen?"
[17:44:06] <PublicWiFi> pretty sure I saw Chris had a fat lip too
[17:44:17] <DrGibbysWifi> Have you seen mine, maccas?
[17:44:20] <PublicWiFi> but hey vinrock is right, it could have very well been a huge thing

[17:44:49] <vinrock> they were seated basically right center in front of chris, there was no security making an appearance, chris ofc says hes not pressing charges, wil gets to stay and receives a standing ovation for some crybaby shit
[17:44:51] <vinrock> CMON DAWG
[17:45:10] <PublicWiFi> he gets a standing ovation later?
[17:45:12] <JollyRgrs> vinrock: that's the industry
[17:45:12] <PublicWiFi> LOL
[17:45:25] <vinrock> yes an industry full of actors
[17:45:27] <vinrock> thats what im sayin
[17:45:27] <SirSlapsalot> "CMON DAWG" is what PublicWiFi says to his dog after he and his wife did snoosnoo
[17:45:29] <JollyRgrs> why would they send security, it was contained... he walked up, then back down... no need

[17:56:56] <fritzwastaken> yea, we have so much fuggin fiber laying around, but none of it was OM3 
[17:56:59] <fritzwastaken> FS.com is fast af
[17:57:05] <JollyRgrs> SirSlapsalot: tbh, i'm no drummer, so I can't give a great opinion... but that seems kinda basic... just "fast" (like metal drumming)... but not really hard, technically speaking
[17:57:07] <fritzwastaken> Didnt expect a 9am delivery when ordered on Friday
[17:57:09] <JollyRgrs> but i could be missing a ton there
[17:57:14] <csws> yeah fs.com is great
[17:57:16] <DrGibbysWifi> While it sounds really complicated, most speed/thrash isn't all that difficult 
[17:57:30] <fritzwastaken> I used to use Monoprice because they were cheap af
[17:57:35] <fritzwastaken> but fs seems to have better quality
[17:57:43] <DrGibbysWifi> I respect those guys' stamina though. It's like sprinting for an hour
[17:57:53] <csws> fritzwastaken, i've done horrible things to my OM3 fibres from fs.com with no issues
[17:58:05] <csws> bends that'd make a networking person cry
[17:58:08] <DrGibbysWifi> Best I could do was about 20-30 mins of it then I was exhausted 
[17:58:11] <fritzwastaken> csws: jesus christ some of the runs here are just horrific
[17:58:17] <fritzwastaken> I didnt know fiber could bend like that until I started here
[17:58:25] <fritzwastaken> shits wrapped around the rack posts
[17:58:27] <csws> it didn't "feel" as nice as the (no doubt insanely expensive) corning shit we had at work but man was it flexible lol
[17:58:27] <fritzwastaken> tight as shit
[17:58:44] <csws> lol
[17:58:54] <fritzwastaken> half of me wants to get a fiber tester, half of me doesnt want to open that can of worms
[17:59:03] <csws> from what I heard there was some great leap forward in terms of disgusting fibre runs like 10+ years ago
[17:59:06] <csws> and now you can get away with a lot more abuse
[17:59:13] <fritzwastaken> Certain segments of our networks have terrible latency, and its either bad cabling or network loops
[17:59:20] <DrGibbysWifi> Isn't fiber able to bend to the curve of a quarter or something?
[17:59:31] <DrGibbysWifi> That's what I remember from my days of cabling 
[17:59:50] <fritzwastaken> I mean, some of our fiber is like you took it flat on your table, and then pulled it over the edge
[17:59:53] <fritzwastaken> like a 90 degree turn
[18:00:02] <DrGibbysWifi> Oh yikes
[18:00:03] <fritzwastaken> not a curve
[18:00:08] <fritzwastaken> not a rounded loopy thing
[18:00:12] <fritzwastaken> a hard pulled corner
[18:00:17] <JollyRgrs> yeah, that can't be good
[18:00:22] <JollyRgrs> don't want a kink in your fiber hose
[18:00:28] <fritzwastaken> lol right? 
[18:00:29] <br14> 90deg turns are hard for light
[18:00:30] <DrGibbysWifi> You can link me tho
[18:00:37] <fritzwastaken> Thats why I bought a bunch of OM3 to replace some known bad ones

[18:04:38] <PublicWiFi> to me it kind of lacks soul now LOL
[18:04:39] <csws> if so then you'll see the connectors turn brown lol
[18:04:45] <csws> that happened on mine
[18:04:49] <fritzwastaken> lol wat
[18:04:51] <PublicWiFi> I want some funk or some fun stuff, not me slamming the drums as fast as possible
[18:05:16] <PublicWiFi> csws: i bet that room was also physical secure
[18:05:27] <PublicWiFi> "physically secure"
[18:05:27] <csws> very secure
[18:05:31] <PublicWiFi> lol
[18:05:35] <csws> I was able to lock the window with the fibre jammed through it
[18:05:38] <csws> which pinched the fibre lol
[18:05:45] <csws> and ofc the door was locked
[18:06:09] <csws> thank god for sloppy manufacturing on window locks
[18:06:18] <fritzwastaken> lul
[18:06:45] <csws> man when I finally freed the fibre it looked horrible
[18:06:59] <csws> nothing as bad as a 90 deg bend but still...
[18:07:04] <csws> surprised it didnt' squish the fibre itself
[18:08:15] <PublicWiFi> Our new NVR comes in today.. I think I'm gonna try to take the old one home lol
[18:08:38] <JollyRgrs> PublicWiFi: to me (again, i am not a drummer)... drums are a rhythm instrument, that's the fun part. it isn't just "how fast you can hit them". same with guitar, the fast things are kinda boring if it is just strumming the same thing over and over, just really fast
[18:08:47] <PublicWiFi> yup!

[20:07:48] <monr0e> Whats the point of using a relay, ooi?
[20:07:51] <PublicWiFi> my relay is 3.0 rip
[20:07:52] <JollyRgrs> PublicWiFi: did you run "/upgrade" in your client?
[20:08:13] <PublicWiFi> i had to add the proper repo and then upgrade
[20:08:17] <PublicWiFi> but yeah, worked perfect
[20:08:20] <teh_f4ll3n> I think this centos 7.4 has a castrated version of curl
[20:08:34] <PublicWiFi> so my relay is on a DMZ and airgapped at home
[20:08:35] <JollyRgrs> monr0e: weechat instance runs... relay means your "instance" is just 1, on the main server running the relay
