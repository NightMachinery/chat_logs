[17:39:51] <ede> MJCD: shouldn't this be View vs Edit?
[17:39:58] <ede> or rather Open
[17:41:04] <MJCD> that's a matter of right click context; in ff's view, not being associated with it I suppose means it might be opened in another browser
[17:41:21] <MJCD> even if it is infact vscode
[17:41:43] <MJCD> the only thing I can think of is a blacklist for the check like if (firefox.exe || chrome.exe
[17:42:15] <MJCD> or to just have it be more simply that it be set as the default browser but that requires an api to check that from the system
[17:42:22] <MJCD> which doesn't always exist
[17:42:31] <MJCD> or isn't always accessible
[17:42:50] <idwer> hi, how  do I get to see a list of commits, made between firefox 95.0.1 and firefox 96.0? followed this link: https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/contributing/vcs/mercurial.html#using-hg-clone to download code from https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central and https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release
[17:43:20] <MJCD> idwer: probably a better question for #git
[17:43:45] <MJCD> there very likely is a way but it's magicks are beyond me
[17:43:47] <idwer> or do the same through their web page
[17:43:55] <idwer> <idwer> firefox 96, when upgrading from 95, has changed their tab caching behaviour, the new behaviour is that when landing on already opened tabs a page reload is done
[17:44:00] <MJCD> huh lol
[17:44:05] <MJCD> its a channel on here
[17:44:31] <idwer> I'll have a look, thanks
[17:46:36] <ede> MJCD: mc inherited its method from nc, F3=Open F4=Edit Enter=Execute (w/e) this all means in the particular context). Enter *may* be its own invention for everything but not executables, dunno.
[17:46:55] <ede> really can't say if windows transports this too to aplications.
[17:47:13] <MJCD> lol jeez I actually didn't understand like 90% of that lol
[17:47:49] <MJCD> idk I just know I virtually never want to double click a .html file to open it vs edit it
[17:48:04] <ede> norton commander (DOS) -> midnight commander (Linux). fully works on keyboard. you can have actions per filetype or extension.
[17:48:11] <MJCD> but am also a web dev so... I suppose that's more true for me than <most>
[17:48:39] <MJCD> and yeah nah I actually like explorer :P
[17:48:59] <MJCD> as crazy as I feel saying that...
[17:49:00] <MJCD> lol
[17:49:40] <ede> one of the first things i dropped in windows back in those days was the explorer. total commander was a really good norton clone for windows, also best used with a keyboard. and that makes it slighly *g* easier to use, there's a few more keys than mouse buttons. ;)
[17:50:44] <ede> did you know their filemanager was only there to get rid of norton? the moment people stopped installing that additional software they dropped it and went on with the inferior explorer.
[17:51:35] <ede> oh, web dev... ony of those... well i hope not one of /those/ :)
[17:54:14] <MJCD> total commander is still around
[17:54:26] <MJCD> is fine, I came up on xtree then ztree lol
[17:55:16] <MJCD> Oh jeez I said a whole thing re; above in the wrong channel -- excuse the smol paste
[17:55:21] <MJCD> but it's not a microsoft issue because all they do is associate some file types
[17:55:21] <MJCD> 10:20 PM they can't /not/ do that, or do it any differently really
[17:55:21] <MJCD> 10:20 PM so moz's check just needs to be relaxed a little
[17:55:21] <MJCD> 10:21 PM if I check the windows 10 OS level setting; it's the default
[17:55:21] <MJCD> 10:21 PM that should be good enough
[17:55:21] <MJCD> 10:22 PM it's like having a requirement to open .js files with firefox or else it's "not truly the default"
[17:55:22] <MJCD> 10:22 PM but ofc it is, opening it in there makes no sense
[17:55:23] <MJCD> 10:23 PM pretty sure that's actually a strong enough argument to put in an issue
[17:55:23] <MJCD> 10:23 PM I love the ""hack"" (the medias terms, not mine) to bypass the windows 10 "Are you sure?" dialogs
[17:55:23] <MJCD> 10:23 PM but feel like being "strict" like this is probably if anything detrimental to their brand
[17:55:24] <MJCD> 10:24 PM especially given most of their users are relatively tech-savvy/aware people
[17:55:24] <MJCD> 10:24 PM if you weren't, in many ways Chrome is an extremely "obvious" choice
[17:55:30] <ede> NAH
[17:55:36] <ede> take care with flooding!
[17:55:37] <MJCD> ;p
[17:55:42] <MJCD> lol can and do sir
[17:55:53] <ede> i've seen people getting autokicked for less lines ;)
[17:55:59] <MJCD> good I hope I do ;p
[17:56:06] <MJCD> #fuckthemonarchy
[17:56:29] <MJCD> tho god save the queen ;p
[17:56:58] <MJCD> anyway tldr it's not an ms problem it's a ff problem because explorer can only do what you tell it to do
[17:56:58] <ede> yeah, what does the registry say? last time i opened one was a decade ago or so xD
[17:57:17] <MJCD> so they need to relax it to /just/ the browser level default setting where available ie windows
[17:57:41] <ede> but shouldn't there be different actions for fileextensions? (can't recall how good or maybe rather bad windows is with actual file *types*)
[17:57:42] <MJCD> I liked the set as default thing they did but this is a step too far
[17:57:51] <MJCD> yes but it's .html
[17:58:03] <MJCD> I get it like oft you download a document as .html in 2022
[17:58:08] <MJCD> or whatever similar thing
[17:58:21] <MJCD> so a STRICT default would handle that file, and complain if it doesn't
[17:58:30] <MJCD> but in reality sometimes html is just html ;p
[17:58:37] <MJCD> and we wanna open it with an editor
[17:58:43] <MJCD> and that's nothing against ff ;p
[17:58:53] <ede> doesn't matter. ok, html is one of the special types/extensions (just like lnk and doc and some more), but if the OS only knows about a single action i doubt there's much a browser could do about it.
[17:58:55] <MJCD> so it's kind of negative branding without any potential upside
[17:59:10] <MJCD> and yes I can right click it and go "open with vs code"
[17:59:24] <MJCD> but i'd do that 500 times a day vs the once a year I need to view a downloaded .html document
[17:59:25] <MJCD> lol
[17:59:52] <MJCD> again, cause webdev -- but that's a valid thing just like I don't need .js files associated with ff just because it can technically handle them
[18:00:05] <MJCD> it's my /default browser/ as the OS exposes
[18:00:34] <ede> because Open is the default action (ENTER) and Edit an additional one. and w/e is registered for Open is the one starting on ENTER.
[18:00:38] <MJCD> if anything personally i'd right click open with firefox when I /did/ want to preview some static content or a .html bill or whatever
[18:01:07] <MJCD> give me a sec to try just to appease you on it one way or the other
[18:01:21] <ede> so either you can have firefox as handler or vscode, but not both. and from firefox's perspective jscode is nothing but some other program being registered. just like chrome or edge would be.
[18:01:42] *** Joins: The_Blode (~Blode@user/the-blode/x-7164444)
[18:01:44] <MJCD> yeah that, as of latest windows 10 atleast, just hard binds to notepad.exe
[18:01:56] <MJCD> and in any OS could be hard bound or not even available at all
[18:02:07] <ede> and such things are the reason why i always used something norton like on the keyboard for file management. it's just easier and more versatile.
[18:02:51] <MJCD> I get what you mean but at the same time still it doesn't /need/ to be the default file handler in /any/ file explorer style app to be the default /browser/
[18:03:02] <MJCD> the system isn't trying to lie to them and they're getting around that
[18:03:17] <MJCD> like they did with the default browser button ""hacks"" (media's terminology not mine)
[18:03:35] <MJCD> but this is just that and running with it to no real benefit to virtually anyone
[18:03:36] <MJCD> like
[18:03:42] <ede> technically you have 7 buttons available on a mouse with a wheel. if the fm (which in explorer's case probably means some system lib) is able to bind a different action to some unused button, at least this would be a workaround.
[18:04:06] <MJCD> it still /will/ be the .html default for the people that only use it for opening a .html downloaded document/invoice a few times a year
[18:04:22] <MJCD> it's only when installing vscode/any ide where this won't be true
[18:04:25] <MJCD> but it's not an accident
[18:04:32] <MJCD> and it's not a slight to firefox
[18:04:40] <MJCD> it's just literally how we want it to be
[18:05:01] <ede> however this situation arose, it's a conflict between two handlers for a single ressource which can be used by only one of them.
[18:05:13] <MJCD> shoving it down peoples throats is a negative thing, and as above there's no real pay off like there was with the previous ""hack""
[18:05:19] <MJCD> it's not.
[18:05:23] <MJCD> and that's totally false.
[18:05:33] <MJCD> both vscode and firefox can /ofc/ handle a .html file
[18:05:43] <MJCD> as can notepad.exe in the "edit" context menu item
[18:05:51] <ede> but only one of them can react on a particular event
[18:05:57] <ede> exactly
[18:06:01] <MJCD> that's true
[18:06:01] <MJCD> but
[18:06:17] <MJCD> it's /default/ was still firefox until I intentionally changed it by installing <an ide>
[18:06:24] <MJCD> so for the EVERYMAN....
[18:06:47] <MJCD> it's identical to "strict" even if kept more relaxed as i'm describing just using the OS level indicator
[18:07:14] <MJCD> for those who need a different primary action, it takes a backseat but in no terms of usage%'s to them
[18:07:31] <MJCD> because I wasn't ever going to edit that html in firefox, even though you technically can :P
[18:07:49] <ede> you want to Open (View) the file or you want to Edit it, that's 2 actions, you can use different handlers for them. but you only can add one of the handlers (per type/extension) to the primary event (like left(dbl)click or Enter)
[18:07:55] <MJCD> nor notepad.exe via the "edit" option
[18:07:59] <ede> remember Oberon?
[18:08:02] <MJCD> also there's no "IDE" filetype
[18:08:07] <MJCD> or handler
[18:08:13] <ede> Interclicks could be the answer :>
[18:08:21] <MJCD> thus why edit is hardcoded
[18:08:23] <MJCD> though I will say
[18:08:28] <ede> press MMB and click RMB
[18:08:32] <MJCD> on an ubuntu tutorial earlier they were using uhhhh
[18:08:45] <MJCD> ${EDITOR: -vi}
[18:08:51] <MJCD> still no idea why but idc
[18:09:03] <MJCD> some ubuntu trash
[18:09:25] <MJCD> and yeah sure new shortcuts sound all well and good and would be valid for MS
[18:09:46] <MJCD> i've personally given up on feedback hub (their new system) because it's totally fucking broken lol
[18:10:18] <ede> there's no IDE filetype, because that's not a filetype at all. IDE is just a class of programs, and from the OS perspective there's only programs, but no classes.
[18:10:19] <MJCD> but /still/ it seems pretty cut and dry; just use the OS level "Yes you are the default browser" setting
[18:10:41] <MJCD> file extensions basically being irrelevant except what each OS attributes to being openable by "the browser"
[18:10:51] <MJCD> the one that the same exposed property defines :P
[18:10:51] <ede> you could open html with quake if you change the assignment, makes no sense at all, but technically possible. the OS is dumb here.
[18:11:05] <MJCD> and as above
[18:11:19] <MJCD> in ubuntu, you COULD make a category of runtime called "IDE"
[18:11:26] <MJCD> you probably wouldn't.
[18:11:33] <MJCD> i know vscode doesn't to date lol
[18:11:35] <MJCD> on any OS
[18:11:43] <MJCD> seems kinda fucking weird to me
[18:11:52] <ede> MJCD: because vi is the fallback if the $EDITOR variable isn't defined. install the editor you want, make your choice or go with the default.
[18:12:00] <MJCD> but as long as it IS the default, system wide, BROWSER
[18:12:04] <MJCD> the rest is kinda tangental
[18:12:09] <MJCD> even new shortcuts for MS
[18:12:22] <MJCD> that's a fine recommendation but either way i'd say this to be true of FF rn
[18:12:51] <MJCD> this isn't a "win for privacy" or anything on brand like with the default browser ""hack"" (for the third time lol)
[18:13:05] <MJCD> it's the kind of propietarianism they're meant to be against
[18:13:06] <ede> nothing special about browsers
[18:13:20] <ede> firefox is just another program known to your windows installation
[18:13:27] <MJCD> .... yes? irrelevant?
[18:13:32] <MJCD> +
[18:13:47] <ede> not for the user, but just a program like all the others to the os
[18:14:02] <MJCD> that would be true in either case tho....
[18:14:22] <MJCD> it's their browser, their system wide default browser being their browser.
[18:14:32] <MJCD> anything to do with filetypes is irrelevant to that
[18:14:51] <MJCD> even if someone somewhere ends up opening a .pdf in Edge by accident because it was still assigned
[18:14:57] <ede> windows and edge? no idea, but in IE days half of the browser was integrated in the OS
[18:15:07] <MJCD> irrelevant now.
[18:15:18] <MJCD> edge is completely separate
[18:15:20] <ede> thus their "argument" making it vital for the OS to even run (including their faked video)
[18:15:28] <ede> well finally
[18:15:31] <MJCD> it is, still in many ways
[18:15:43] <MJCD> but it's a minimized and solo "explorer"
[18:15:52] <MJCD> but it doesn't do the start bar or anything anymore
[18:16:00] <MJCD> you can entirely uninstall IE11
[18:16:03] <ede> i never liked this thing with browsers or file managers being part of the system (even for a DE)
[18:16:15] <MJCD> me either but again it's kind of totally irrelevant lol

[22:31:34] <roosterphant> dont wanna lose a web game record
[22:32:17] <eXtr3m0> press f12 and type document.cookie
[22:34:30] <eXtr3m0> can also be that the data is stored in localStorage or sessionStorage.
[22:34:59] <eXtr3m0> typing JSON.stringify(sessionStorage) and JSON.stringify(localStorage) will output a json string with all stored local/session storage data
[22:37:17] <roosterphant> eXtr3m0: thanks i found it in localstorage
[22:37:44] <roosterphant> how can i put this variable back in the normal session
[22:38:17] <eXtr3m0> localStorage.setItem('key', 'value')
[22:39:36] <roosterphant> thanks
[22:40:07] <eXtr3m0> keep in mind that JSON stringify has altered the value.
[22:40:16] <roosterphant> yeah gotcha
[22:45:07] <roosterphant> hm it doesnt seem to be working
[22:45:27] <roosterphant> oh weird
[22:45:48] <roosterphant> it must be storing the data somewhere else
[22:46:04] <eXtr3m0> if you identified the key, you can do localStorage.getItem('key') in both and compare the two results via 'string1' == 'string2'
[22:46:27] <eXtr3m0> are there no cookies set at all? sometimes you will see a PHP SESSION cookie that might be required as well.
