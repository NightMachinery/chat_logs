[00:05:05] <pteague> prescription
[00:05:14] <sentionics> that was a one time Rx
[00:05:21] <sentionics> I have only 5 doses left
[00:05:31] <Berlin36_> why do u take them
[00:05:34] <sentionics> it's for my 4 wisdom tooth extractions
[00:05:40] <Berlin36_> oh
[00:05:42] <Berlin36_> btw
[00:05:45] <Berlin36_> i had one extraction
[00:05:52] <Berlin36_> didn't feel anything
[00:05:53] <Berlin36_> like
[00:05:58] <Berlin36_> NOTHING
[00:06:00] <sentionics> I'm in a lot of pain at the moment, or I would be. but the percocet works
[00:06:10] <sentionics> and alcohol.
[00:06:16] <sentionics> I feel really good
[00:06:17] <Berlin36_> lmao i asked my doctor: sooo when do we extract?
[00:06:19] <pteague> i had 3 wisdom teeth pulled & a molar in front of the 4th because the wisdom tooth had basically carved the top of it off
[00:06:22] <Berlin36_> and he said: wut?
[00:06:27] <Berlin36_> i said: eell the tooth
[00:06:35] <Berlin36_> he said: oh, it's done
[00:06:48] <sentionics> you lucky bastards
[00:06:48] <pteague> Berlin36_, did they put you to sleep to do it?
[00:06:54] <Berlin36_> no lol
[00:07:00] <Berlin36_> they injected something
[00:07:17] <sentionics> they numbed it and it went proper
[00:07:31] <pteague> they injected me multiple times & then just had to give up because they were running out of time so i got to feel most of it
[00:07:42] <Berlin36_> ooof
[00:07:43] <sentionics> my bottom right didn't go proper, this shit hurts like hell when I'm sober
[00:07:52] <Berlin36_> they extracted it in like 10 min the whole procedure
[00:08:02] <Berlin36_> im 15 btw
[00:08:20] <sentionics> they put me to sleep to surgery my teeth out, Berlin
[00:08:43] <pteague> i think i had that done in my late 20s or early 30s
[00:08:43] <sentionics> my wisdom teeth were weird though
[00:09:13] <sentionics> my bottom right was like the titanic, 45 degree angle and contacting the next tooth
[00:09:16] <Berlin36_> then i felt a light pain the next two days
[00:09:20] <Berlin36_> but after that it was gone
[00:09:36] <Berlin36_> mine was kinda like that, i can't remember
[00:09:39] <sentionics> my dad had the same problem. guess its genetic
[00:09:45] <Berlin36_> maybe
[00:09:48] <sentionics> also, I'm so high
[00:09:49] <pteague> sentionics, sounds like the wisdom tooth i left in ... it had already crushed the tooth in front of it
[00:09:54] <sentionics> holy shit I'm high
[00:09:59] <Berlin36_> how do u know that
[00:10:21] <sentionics> don't understand that question
[00:10:23] <Berlin36_> how do u feel that u know you are high
[00:10:27] <sentionics> oh
[00:10:29] <sentionics> easy
[00:10:43] <sentionics> I hate the feeling of a body high
[00:10:46] <Berlin36_> pteague that's kinda bad
[00:10:53] <Berlin36_> that is why i extracted it
[00:10:56] <sentionics> it actually is a special kind of suffering
[00:11:01] <sentionics> I feel it coming on
[00:11:08] <sentionics> I know what's coming
[00:11:11] <Berlin36_> i wore braces for about 4 years, it would have been a pitty if that tooth ruined everything
[00:11:20] <sentionics> the anxiety it breeds, it's not good
[00:11:31] <sentionics> I'm on the edge of my sanity right now
[00:11:37] <Berlin36_> oof
[00:11:42] <pteague> Berlin36_, it was already too late for the tooth so we extracted it & hoped the wisdom tooth could then rotate down into the spot ... it kind of has
[00:12:18] <Berlin36_> welp as long as it does not ruin everything, it's okay
[00:12:20] <sentionics> ugh,l I really want to lay down. but I can't
[00:12:40] <Berlin36_> i talked to a guy that almost passed away from lsd lmao
[00:12:47] <Berlin36_> he was fucking high
[00:12:48] <sentionics> I will fight to stay awake

[00:16:34] <sentionics> well, it hurt a lot, my bottom right. so I took it

[01:10:03] <dfch> and all the way up
[01:10:05] <Berlin36> i want to learn asm too
[01:10:12] <Berlin36> even tried it
[01:10:14] <Berlin36> FASM
[01:10:16] <Berlin36> but
[01:10:19] <dfch> but?
[01:10:25] <Berlin36> it really requires a lot of time to learn
[01:10:29] <dfch> indeed
[01:10:34] <Berlin36> so i don't have enough time on cpp
[01:10:45] <dfch> but the understanding afterwards is quite rewarding
[01:10:48] <Berlin36> i decided to stick a lil more to cpp and then go to asm
[01:11:12] <Berlin36> yeeah, also it help while reversing
[01:11:18] <Berlin36> and doing..low level stuff
[01:11:23] <dfch> You can watch lain and understand asm references :p
[01:11:43] <dfch> MIPS-ASM in layer 4
[01:11:43] <Berlin36> okay
[01:11:44] <dfch> :p
[01:11:51] <Berlin36> •_•
[01:13:10] <Berlin36> for how long did you write in asm?
[01:13:29] <Roey> <Berlin36> Roey, what would you suggest me to learn, if c++ is dead? <- python
[01:13:42] <Berlin36> and did you learn it by yourself? dfch
[01:13:46] <Berlin36> what... python?
[01:13:50] <Roey> yes, python
[01:13:53] <Berlin36> lol
[01:13:55] <Berlin36> ehy
[01:13:57] <Berlin36> whh
[01:13:59] <Berlin36> why
[01:14:15] <dfch> Berlin36, of course I did not, I was just a dumb kid, I used documentation written by other people
[01:14:16] <lastonestanding> !c tren
[01:14:17] <ImoutoBot> lastonestanding: Trenbolone is an androgen and anabolic steroid of the nandrolone group which itself was never marketed. Trenbolone ester prodrugs, including trenbolone acetate and trenbolone hexahydrobenzylcarbonate, are or have been marketed for veterinary and clinical use.
[01:14:22] <Roey> because it dispenses with the nonsense that trips you up as a programmer and just lets you concentrate on writing code
[01:14:29] <Roey> Berlin36: ^
[01:14:34] <Berlin36> yeah i see
[01:14:38] <Roey> for example:
[01:14:44] <Roey> - having to think about types all the time
[01:14:56] <Berlin36> hmm
[01:15:08] <Roey> - having to think about == or = and getting tripped up by stupid mistakes from that 
[01:15:12] <Berlin36> idunno man, c++ syntax is okay
[01:15:20] <Roey> - having to write a lot of boilerplate code
[01:15:26] <Roey> Berlin36:do you know python already?
[01:15:39] <Roey> Berlin36: have you seen its syntax?
[01:15:42] <Berlin36> no, but i don't feel it would be hard to learn
[01:15:45] <Roey> it's just beautiful code
[01:15:49] <Roey> it's super easy to learn
[01:15:52] <Roey> barely an inconvenience
[01:15:56] <Berlin36> i don't like python syntax
[01:16:04] <Roey> Berlin36: what don't you like about it?
[01:16:12] <Berlin36> i may be very strange, but it's harder for me to learn it's syntax than cpp
[01:16:26] <Roey> why not try it out for a few days anyway?
[01:16:29] <Berlin36> cpp seems harder but it makes you memorize it easier
[01:16:36] <Berlin36> idk
[01:16:41] <Berlin36> gonna try tho
[01:16:47] <Berlin36> what should i write?
[01:17:08] <Berlin36> i have some friends that write in python
[01:18:06] <Roey> hmm hwow about writing something simple
[01:18:18] <Berlin36> for example?
[01:18:22] <lastonestanding> how about preparing for the future?
[01:18:25] <Roey> like a small database for something (like, not a SQL database, just a database for yourself)
[01:18:26] <lastonestanding> learn Rust
[01:18:31] <lastonestanding> that is the future
[01:18:35] <Berlin36> oof
[01:18:46] <lastonestanding> the linux kernel will be rewritten in Rust at some point
[01:18:47] <Berlin36> just a database for myself?
[01:18:53] <Roey> Berlin36: look, everyone you speak to here will have their own favorite programming language and library
[01:19:02] <Berlin36> yeah i know :D
[01:19:08] <lastonestanding> and the linux kernel is the most important piece of software
[01:19:12] <Berlin36> it's interesting to see other's opinions

[02:23:23] <il> ButterNoodle, what's broken, point it out

[02:23:57] <Berlin36> well im not from US
[02:23:57] <Roey> Berlin36: so that they still get a cut of the money, if the citizen is dual-citizen of both that country and the US
[02:24:11] <Roey> Berlin36: yeah
[02:24:13] <ButterNoodle> just because you say something means something.. doesnt make it fact

[02:24:51] <Jigsy> Audience with a drum to bang needs an audience.

[02:28:19] <ButterNoodle> yea logic is hard for some people
[02:28:22] <Jigsy> "It's physically impossible to like something and not act on it."
[02:28:23] <ButterNoodle> common sense too...
[02:28:23] <dfch> Before I left. il, pedophilia is wrong I'm 100% with you on that one, but you're talking about cartoons, so I would advise you to steer away from labeling people
[02:28:33] <dfch> and being less edgy
[02:28:47] <il> dfch, jigsy just said he likes the idea of fucking children and he thinks it's possible to like it without acting on it lol
[02:29:00] <Berlin36> um
[02:29:06] <Berlin36> that is bad
[02:29:09] <il> Jigsy, let me guess, you're a MAP?
[02:29:14] <Jigsy> By that logic it's impossible to kill people in video games and find murder utterly reprehensible.
[02:29:17] <Jigsy> A what?
[02:29:24] <il> ahahahah
[02:29:45] <dfch> il so does rms, let's not create drama here. fucking children is wrong, sure. Thought policing is also wrong.
[02:29:46] <Berlin36> how did we end up talking about Central Processors?
[02:30:17] <Jigsy> dfch: Nobody here is advocating fucking children though.
[02:30:19] <Jigsy> Aside from il.
[02:30:26] <il> dfch, I'm not thought policing, I'm not an admin/mod

[02:30:41] <il> Jigsy, you're screaming awfully loudly, mate
[02:30:45] <dfch> Jigsy I understand it fullly, and if it is to happen it will be punished. 
[02:30:51] <Jigsy> Actually, he's awfully defensive about this.
[02:31:01] <ButterNoodle> yea Jigsy those people always have skeletons in their closet... being a youth minister or scout leader.. you can always pick em out in a crowd
[02:31:08] <Jigsy> il: I'm not your mate.
[02:31:12] <il> Holy shit, if you don't get arrested some time soon, I don't know who will

[02:31:52] <Berlin36> how the fuck do you type so fast
[02:31:54] <il> We'd just call it what it is
[02:31:58] <dfch> il, well you may act in a good faith, but as an op, I'm kindly asking you to stop
[02:31:59] <il> Berlin36, me?
[02:32:01] <Jigsy> He's got that "I'm more moral than you are" attitude.

[02:32:07] <il> Berlin36, practice.
[02:32:12] <Berlin36> pretty cool

[02:50:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> isekaijin: seL4 was also intended to be in some ML dialect originally, but proofing tooling & programmer availability was better for C.
[02:51:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Expecting most programs to be proofed is a doomed proposition anyway. Either the design will be flawed (which proofs will only help as much as rubberducking would) or they won't be proofed/verified and they'll be flawed in some other way.
[02:52:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> A secure isolating core & userspace above it is the general idea for isolating non-guaranteed programs.
[02:52:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's basically the same idea as Qubes but better.
[02:54:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The same core ideas about Capability addressing & management are mentioned in the LispOS papers for that matter...

[03:24:27] <isekaijin> Aurora_v_kosmose: It is at times like these that I see that the Lisp folks had it right. Just tag the damn data. The runtime cost of processing the tag is nil compared to the cost of dealing with security nightmares.
[03:25:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yep
[03:25:52] <isekaijin> Modern C-based operating systems spend a lot of time and effort imperfectly reinventing solutions to security problems that were built-in in Lisp machines.
[03:28:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Capability-based security, particularly addressing, was also implemented in some mainframes.

[04:46:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Did they even ahve running water in the 17th century?
[04:46:27] <ButterNoodle> when I worked in a warehouse.. a bidet would have been the perfect cure for summer swamp ass
[04:46:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I imagine it had more in common with a wash-bassin than a bidet
[04:46:34] <ButterNoodle> yes
[04:46:52] <Roey> LOL
[04:47:00] <Roey> so I was visiting a friend in Paris
[04:47:14] <Roey> and she showed me how her bathroom in her parents' place had both a toilet
[04:47:29] <Roey> and a curious wash-basin she called a "bidet", which I had never seen before
[04:47:45] <Roey> and I kept thinking it's something mysterious for women to do 
[04:47:50] <Roey> I'm like "er... ok"
[04:47:52] <ButterNoodle> yes

[09:12:56] <ButterNoodle> you should stop.. since ur on pain meds too
[09:13:12] <senti> not right now. I'm on no meds just alcohol today
[09:13:24] <senti> I should stop drinking, yeah
[09:13:59] <senti> yesterday, taking percocet was a huge gamble, but it just made me high, fortunately.
[09:14:25] <senti> I really don't like being high that much
[09:14:40] <amigojapan> I don't think it is realistic to ask senti to stop drinking ButterNoodle 
[09:14:43] <senti> also, I'm no longer in pain I think
[09:15:04] <senti> at least, I don't feel any pain, just drunk
[09:15:09] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: yes.. he's an addict
[09:15:17] <amigojapan> Yup
[09:15:44] <ButterNoodle> I'm not tryin to pull a "holier than thou" kinda bullshit either
[09:15:44] <senti> I'm also a thrill-seeker probably the source of my addiction maybe

[09:16:25] <ButterNoodle> I hit the bottle hard for 7 years
[09:16:43] <senti> you beat your addiction
[09:16:52] <ButterNoodle> dropped it, and have had probably 3 drinks in 4 months...
[09:17:07] <ButterNoodle> I just have a different approach to live
[09:17:07] <senti> wow, you must have god tier willpower
[09:17:11] <ButterNoodle> *life
[09:17:14] <ButterNoodle> I do
[09:17:26] <senti> heh, I want to be like that too
[09:17:56] <senti> it's hard to change
[09:17:57] <ButterNoodle> you have to objectively look at the "human condition" and separate ur actions from what ur dog shit urges are telling you to do
[09:18:05] <amigojapan> I used up all my will power in quitting smoking
[09:18:37] <ButterNoodle> emotional state is a cock sucker in trying to be objective
[09:18:41] <senti> amigojapan: I hear smoking is harder to quit than drinking. It's amazing you managed that. You are a superman!
[09:19:02] <ButterNoodle> I think it depends on the situation
[09:19:19] <amigojapan> senti: it probably depends on what each person is addicted to
[09:19:21] <ButterNoodle> I started heavy drinking when I was at a low point in life..
[09:19:26] <senti> I'm generally speaking a rather mental person
[09:19:41] <senti> so I guess, alcohol just kinda jived way too much with me
[09:19:49] <ButterNoodle> and quit right before some real bullshit went down in my life

[09:20:39] <senti> I can't really related.

[09:23:00] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[09:23:02] <ButterNoodle> but ig its all just a dopamine trigger
[09:23:09] <ButterNoodle> thats the fix
[09:23:16] <senti> not sure, but alcohol may bring out some adrenaline maybe? eh, probably not. Maybe it's all dopamine. I'm just speculating.
[09:23:16] <amigojapan> I see
[09:23:19] <ButterNoodle> some get it through gatcha games

[09:31:20] <ButterNoodle> I met her by absolute chance
[09:31:34] <senti> you might think it was chance
[09:31:42] <senti> maybe she wanted you
[09:31:44] <ButterNoodle> met her friend in a group of girls out at the weekend hangout...
[09:31:51] <senti> you didn't score her. She scored you
[09:31:55] <ButterNoodle> her friend was the least pretty..
[09:32:18] <ButterNoodle> took her out, and she asked if her friend could come along...
[09:32:27] <senti> girls often keep friends with other girls who are less pretty
[09:32:34] <senti> or so I think
[09:32:43] <senti> ego boost
[09:33:07] <ButterNoodle> turns out she was nervous that I would try to pull some freaky shit on her so she wanted a friend to come along to tone the mood down
[09:33:18] <senti> that's rather awful of me to say that, I'm sorry :(
[09:33:34] <ButterNoodle> in all fairness she talked like a whore on the phone..
[09:33:42] <senti> nice!
[09:33:49] <senti> I love dirty talk!
[09:33:51] <ButterNoodle> but after paying for all 3 of us.. dinner and a movie
[09:34:10] <senti> you basically worked and paid for it
[09:34:15] <amigojapan> senti: tomako says "the most important thing in a relationship is not the looks or the personality, it's if you get along or not"
[09:34:17] <ButterNoodle> she started acting like a cunt. so I dropped her off first and chatted up her friend
[09:34:50] <senti> amigojapan: does Tomako think I'd be a good man to a woman if I sobered up?
[09:34:52] <ButterNoodle> got the friends # and she was catholic schoolgirl #1 best girl ever

[09:44:16] <senti> well, to be fair, I do sometimes catch up with friends. Facebook is a convenient medium to do so, but it's just not an everyday thing.
[09:44:34] <senti> facebook is wonderful for hitting up old friends

[11:03:41] <sentionics> It's more like over a 100
[11:03:53] <sentionics> but it is spread out over many days

[11:04:18] <sentionics> and this isn't even me at my worst

[11:06:34] <sentionics> you think I can just not
[11:06:41] <sentionics> no, i only drink
[11:06:53] <sentionics> I also tried weed

[11:08:28] <sentionics> but so many people do it
[11:08:31] <Berlin36_> it is not
[11:08:33] <sentionics> I have smoked
[11:08:39] <Berlin36_> it is an addiction
[11:08:41] <sentionics> cigs just bore me
[11:08:43] <Nanobot> Today, I tried Greek yogurt for the first time. Also, today, I tried Greek yogurt for the last time.
[11:08:51] <Berlin36_> you can not stop if you tried it
[11:09:05] <Berlin36_> at least that's what some smokers told me
[11:09:13] <sentionics> it's like, where's the buzz, where's the euphoria? waste of my time
[11:09:19] <Berlin36_> they would want to not smoke, but they can not
[11:09:33] <Berlin36_> they are addicted to it

[14:51:49] <KatrinValerie> Isn't the author of nana dead? Or are they just on hiatus for their health?

[21:42:48] <Berlin36_> because legs hide it
[21:43:29] <lastonestanding> meaning there is no pp

[21:45:03] <Berlin36_> not exactly lastonestanding
[21:45:22] <Berlin36_> if you can't see something, doesn't necesarilly mean it's not there
[21:48:13] <lastonestanding> but what is the point of a pp that which you cannot see?!
[21:48:31] <lastonestanding> you have to put in on display
[21:54:14] <Berlin36_> guys
[21:54:29] <Berlin36_> is there a way to generate truly random numbers on a computer?
[21:54:46] <Berlin36_> i wanna do it in c++
[21:55:04] <Berlin36_> some suggest reading a few bytes from /dev/random or /dev/urandom
[21:57:25] <lastonestanding> I would buy a cat and let it run over my keyboard to generate random input

[22:46:40] <Cryowolf> emmeka, eh it was in Sweden and Denmark
[22:47:17] <Cryowolf> Sweden made codeine OTC illegal, Denmark came up with a compound that bound the codeine together with the NSAID
[22:47:35] <Cryowolf> so you couldnt separate them, thus making it useless to abuse

[22:52:30] <MootPoot> being on oxy sounds cool
[22:52:41] <emmeka> why...
[22:52:52] <emmeka> it's a pretty lame opiate, as far as they go

[22:53:11] <Cryowolf> emmeka, that's irrelevant for me, I don't care of I become addicted or not. I take when I need
