[17:29:25] <ERROH> meet faux, the stanley of our office
[17:48:54] <Juliu> I still want someone to teach me how to program my problem's solution
[17:49:19] <Renderwww> Stanley trying to do is job https://j.gifs.com/764xYr.gif
[17:49:32] <Renderwww> wait, are you Stanley in The Stanley Parable?
[18:06:23] *** Joins: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse)
[18:14:35] <Juliu> I have 5 minutes left, so can anyone please teach me how to code this stuff?
[18:15:06] <Faux> Probably not, no, because teaching people is hard work and we're not very good at it.
[18:15:17] <Juliu> Try me
[18:16:21] <Raziel> Juliu, did you even mention what "this stuff" is
[18:18:21] <Juliu> #include <iostream>   std::string f( int n ) { if( n ) return f( n-1 ) + f( n-1 ); else return "Try harder! "; }   void main() { std::cout << f( 32 ) << std::endl; }
[18:19:00] <Faux> geordi: std::string f( int n ) { if( n ) return f( n-1 ) + f( n-1 ); else return "Try harder! "; }   void main() { std::cout << f( 32 ) << std::endl; }
[18:19:00] <geordi> error: '::main' must return 'int'
[18:19:13] <Juliu> Raziel, I want to program a program that return true or false depending on if node B is reachable from node A within a directed graph G
[18:19:37] <Juliu> geordi is an idiot
[18:19:54] <Faux> She's trying to teach you.
[18:20:00] <Raziel> okay, so, implement the bruteforce way first
[18:20:04] <Juliu> She made a mistake, not me
[18:20:12] <Juliu> Raziel, how?
[18:20:56] <Juliu> Faux, are you sure geordi is a she?
[18:20:58] <Raziel> you start at A, you loop over the valid links, you do the same on those, if one of them is B you return true, if you run out of links you return false
[18:21:00] <Raziel> v:
[18:21:14] <Faux> Juliu: It seems like a reasonable assumption?
[18:21:19] <Raziel> so, recursively is probably the most straightforward in this case
[18:22:02] <Juliu> Raziel, so from A i go to C, and from C i go to A, and from A to C, and from C to A, ... sounds like a solid plan
[18:22:28] <Raziel> Juliu, you did not mention that your graph can have loops
[18:22:29] <Raziel> :p
[18:22:45] <Juliu> Raziel, I did not meantion that my graph can have no loops
[18:23:11] <Juliu> Raziel, I think you're standing in a forest
[18:24:48] <Raziel> I suppose one way is for each of your visit loops to hold previously visited nodes, and abort if you see one that's already in there again
[18:27:21] <Juliu> geordi: std::string f( int n ) { if( n ) return f( n-1 ) + f( n-1 ); else return "Try harder! "; }   int main() { std::cout << f( 6 ) << std::endl; return 0; }
[18:27:22] <geordi> Try harder! Try harder! Try harder! Try harder! Try harder! Try harder! Try harder! Try harder! Try harder! Try harder! Try harder! Try harder! Try harder! Try harder! Try harder!

[18:27:29] <Juliu> geordi: std::string f( int n ) { if( n ) return f( n-1 ) + f( n-1 ); else return "Try harder! "; }   int main() { std::cout << f( 8 ) << std::endl; return 0; }
[18:27:30] <geordi> Try harder! Try harder! Try harder! Try harder! Try harder! Try harder! Try harder! Try harder! Try harder! Try harder! Try harder! Try harder! Try harder! Try harder! Try harder!

[18:27:39] <Juliu> Damn, geordi is cheating
[18:28:39] <Juliu> Raziel, ok, good plan. No do the same with O(log(n)) working memory 
[18:28:45] <Juliu> *Now
[18:29:10] <T`aZ> pffrr, this screams constexpr, who needs memory at runtime anyway
[18:29:46] <Faux> You're trying to invent the racecar algorithm, for finding cycles in linked lists, right? I have also attended a tech interview at a shit company.
[18:29:51] <Juliu> T`aZ, O(1) runtime memory? Ok, I'm glad you except the challenge
[18:30:09] <Juliu> Faux, no
[18:30:35] <Raziel> Juliu, sure, gimme a couple weeks and a few grand
[18:31:50] <Juliu> Raziel, how many?
[18:32:43] <Raziel> well considering at the moment I don't even know if it's possible, it's hard to say. :p
[18:32:57] <Juliu> Raziel, sounds like a deal
[18:33:10] <Juliu> Raziel, or you teach me how to do it in 5 minutes
[18:33:46] <Renderwww> teach us senpai Raziel!
[18:38:32] <Raziel> pretty sure if I knew how I'd already be making a lot more money than I currently am :thonk:
[18:45:04] <Juliu> How would you make money then?
[18:47:45] <Juliu> Raziel, answer, you fuck
[18:47:50] <Raziel> wow r00d
[18:48:29] <Raziel> I imagine being the guy that made a far more space-efficient algorithm than A* and dijkstra would find many opportunities to make fat stacks
[18:49:11] <Faux> There's a Google paper on post-A* routing for google maps somewhere, pretty good. Feels like it's full of hacks but obviously it works.
[18:49:29] <Juliu> Dijkstra and A* are for shortest paths, not just the existence of paths
[18:49:31] <Faux> They shortcut via. lighthouses; it's arguably just a heuristic system for A* though.
[18:49:52] <Faux> "Existence of path" is just connectivity, right?
[18:50:10] <Juliu> directed connectivity, yes
[18:50:59] <Faux> We actually do graph stuff at work, it makes it feel almost like it was worth doing a computer degree.
[18:51:26] <Renderwww> just do a depth first search, or the other one
[18:51:29] <Renderwww> fat first search
[18:51:33] <Renderwww> width first search
[18:51:47] <Renderwww> breadth
[18:52:29] <Juliu> I can teach you an algorithm that only uses logirthmic the amount of memory compared to Dijkstra or A*, and even returns the shortest path if you want
[18:53:00] *** Parts: Faux (~faux@fau.xxx) (You can also get fucked, for free.)
[18:53:07] <Renderwww> kek
[18:53:16] <Juliu> I'm not joking
[18:54:40] <Juliu> Dijkstra uses O(n log n) bits of memory. "My" algorithm uses O((log n)^2) bits of memory
[18:55:45] <Juliu> Almost only logarithmically as much memory
[18:56:15] <Juliu> So how do I make money with that?
[19:02:39] <Juliu> Raziel, answer me, you fuck!
[19:03:50] <Raziel> I dunno, I'm better at spending money than making it
[19:04:05] <Juliu> I don't make any money at all since 3 years :(
[19:04:35] <Raziel> I imagine you'd have to write a nice polite paper explaining the algorithm... then somehow patent or copyright the algorithm? which idk the technicalities of. then sell it to someone, or sell the rights to use it.
[19:05:39] <Juliu> The algorithm is very simple. I can teach you in 5 minutes
[19:06:11] <Juliu> How do you make money with publishing a paper? Or with selling something that you already publised for free earlier on?
[19:06:13] <Raziel> then I find it unlikely for it to be new
[19:06:23] <Juliu> I never said it was new
[19:06:29] <Raziel> oof
[19:06:44] <Juliu> New to you guys probably
[19:07:03] <Raziel> you can potentially make money by selling a working implementation, maybe? v:
[19:07:07] <Juliu> The algorithm starts by guessing the right length of the shortest path
[19:07:45] <Juliu> You do that by simply trying all possible lengths from 0 to n
[19:08:30] <Juliu> And then you try to find a path from A to B of length at most this length. It automatically is a shortest path since all other smaller length before couldn't find a path from A to B
[19:09:28] <Oxyd> So it's pseudopolynomial.
[19:10:09] <Juliu> No, since the input is a graph with n nodes, and not just a number
[19:11:35] <Oxyd> I'm not sure O((log n)^2) bits is enough to even encode the input graph. How do you represent the graph?
[19:11:49] <Juliu> Once you know that L is the length of a shortest path from A to B, you can output A and try to find a path from a neighbor of A to B in length L-1
[19:12:19] <Juliu> Oxyd, I said O((log n)^2) working memory
[19:12:27] <Raziel> I can see how that does use less space for the computation than the alternatives... but isn't it also much much slower, as runtime?
[19:12:38] <Oxyd> Ah, okay. So O(n + (log n)^2) total memory.
[19:13:07] <Juliu> Raziel, the overall runtime will be something like O(n^2 * 2^n), I think. So no big deal :D
[19:13:29] <Oxyd> Actually that algorithm sort of reminds me of that one theorem I can't remember the name of right now…
[19:14:18] <Oxyd> Ah, Savitch's theorem.
[19:14:23] <Juliu> Oxyd, the input is of size O(n^2 * log n) bits in the worst case
[19:15:15] <Oxyd> And, indeed, the proof of Savitch's theorem relies on an algorithm that runs in O((log n)^2) space.
[19:15:35] <Juliu> Oxyd, indeed. You can use Savitch to then also find the shortest path. Not just reachability, not just the length of the shortest path, but actually the path itself. (Although the path itself can't be stored in memory with this little working memory of couse)
[19:16:16] <Oxyd> I don't think Savitch uses the path either.
[19:16:54] <Juliu> Oxyd, no, but you CAN output a path from A to B, or even a shortest path from A to B with this little working memory
[19:18:04] <Juliu> But Raziel won't tell me how I can make money with that :(
[19:21:05] <Juliu> Oxyd, teach me how to make money, senpai
[19:21:29] <Oxyd> Step 1: Get naked.
[19:22:21] <Raziel> Step 2: make videos in which you teach algorithms naked
[19:22:21] <Juliu> Step 3: Profit ?
[19:23:06] <Juliu> Raziel, dude, have you seen the rise of youtube math and computer science videos taught by girls during the last years? Man, those nerds must be needy
[19:23:35] <Juliu> Sadly I have the wrong gender to make money from getting naked
