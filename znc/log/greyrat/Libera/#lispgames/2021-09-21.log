[00:17:53] <borodust> ehhh, okay, that was intended as a single message, but my erc-fu ain't good enough
[00:18:47] <borodust> like it, bump it, share it :)
[00:20:29] <borodust> |3b|: thanks for wiki update
[01:03:38] <dthompson> ooh I was just wondering if a fall jam was happening
[01:04:57] <dthompson> mfiano: I see you've already changed the topic but I don't remember giving you op powers. you're certainly welcome to them, I just don't remember anything :)
[01:10:04] <mfiano> dthompson: I tried contacting you for months before I registered the official lispgames organization through the Libera process, which reset everything
[01:10:26] <mfiano> since single # channels are reserved for official organizations anyway
[01:10:53] <dthompson> mfiano: how were you trying to contact me? I didn't receive anything
[01:11:08] <dthompson> am I not an op anymore? I created this channel.
[01:11:15] <mfiano> DM, and you were never online except once
[01:11:27] <dthompson> no email?
[01:11:51] <dthompson> there's all sorts of ways to contact me. I wish you had just done that instead of circumventing me.
[01:12:24] <dthompson> I don't have an always-on irc client.
[01:12:52] <mfiano> Well it isn't anyone's personal organization, so I retained the original administrators we had.
[01:13:10] <mfiano> Otherwise you should have registered an org-less ## channel if you wanted to own it personally
[01:13:53] <dthompson> mfiano: I didn't want to own it personally!
[01:14:22] <dthompson> but I went out of the way to get this created here during the rift with freenode and I don't appreciate just being circumvented with no real attempt to contact me.
[01:14:39] <dthompson> at the time you said you were staying on freenode!
[01:15:46] <mfiano> creating a channel doesn't reserve it. any organization can take over a # channel!
[01:16:11] <mfiano> That has always been the rules on the old Freenode
[01:16:27] <dthompson> lisp games is a registered 503 (c) or something??
[01:16:30] <dthompson> news to me.
[01:16:33] <mfiano> No
[01:16:45] <mfiano> Freenode's definition of an organization/project
[01:16:50] <dthompson> okay I don't follow but whatever
[01:16:51] <mfiano> Well now, Libera's
[01:19:55] <dthompson> I guess I have to figure out what this means because I have channels registered for personal projects that I wouldn't like to be taken away.
[01:22:02] <mfiano> If the channel name is the name of a real organization or of an open-source project, then proof of ownership of that org/project by filing a request as per the rules on their website, will get your project registered, which gives you control over the whole #<PROJECT_NAME>* namespace
[01:22:16] <dthompson> okay. good to know. thanks.
[01:22:25] <mfiano> There are exceptions. For generic projects, like #linux or #windows, you must instead register a community
[01:23:34] <mfiano> THis is the big distinction between # and ## channels.
[01:23:51] <mfiano> But if you own the projects you speak of, then you can provide proof to register them officially with the network
[01:24:22] *** Joins: zap (~zap@gateway/tor-sasl/zap)
[01:24:24] <mfiano> All I did was simply retain the original administrators to make everyone happy/consistent
[01:24:59] <mfiano> Sorry if you were hurt/didn't understand the rules. I don't personally "own" anything though.
[01:25:05] <mfiano> Time to eat dinner though.
[01:25:30] <|3b|> dthompson: for whatever it is worth, your efforts to get the channel registered during the network move are appreciated :)
[01:25:38] <mfiano> Yes very much so
[01:26:09] <|3b|> mfiano: out of curiosity, who are the admins?
[01:26:13] <mfiano> I can add you as a channel administrator later when I get back if you want. I just simply didn't know how to contact you to modify the access list
[01:26:33] <mfiano> uhh, i think it was you, psilord, and rpav...maybe some more
[01:26:37] <mfiano> i'll check when i get back
[01:27:05] <dthompson> mfiano: I don't need to be a channel admin. all good there.
[01:28:40] <dthompson> glad everything is sorted out.

[01:35:38] <mfiano> Backish. Are you sure? I don't want you to feel like we stole anything from you. This is a jointly managed community :)
[01:36:18] <mfiano> You creating the channel and protecting us from squatters until the registration process (takes weeks) completes was a lifesaver
[01:36:49] <mfiano> dthompson: ^
[01:38:03] <mfiano> |3b|: Hmm, I added the nicks to the registration form, but it appears the access list is empty. I think libera didn't do that part...
[01:38:13] <mfiano> I will fix that manually in a bit
[01:39:43] <mfiano> Anyone object with me, |3b|, dthompson, and dto as channel operators? Seems to be only regulars left (dropping rpav and psilord in favor of dthompson and dto)
[01:39:49] <borodust> dthompson: yes, much tanks for keeping it safe! i
[01:40:00] <borodust> *i'm not against you owning it either ;p
[01:40:01] <mfiano> oh and borodust 
[01:40:13] <mfiano> so add borodust to the list :)
[01:40:23] <borodust> i was once, yes ;p
[01:42:23] <|3b|> ok with me
[01:42:52] <dthompson> mfiano: I don't feel like anything was stolen. I don't own this channel. it's a community thing. I just had no idea what happened, but also I wasn't really paying attention because I've been busy doing other things.
[01:43:06] <|3b|> also, do we have a cloak? if so, might as well use it instead of the generic one :)
[01:43:18] <dthompson> if you want more admins for better coverage, you can add me.
[01:44:27] <borodust> |3b|: double that

[02:01:15] <borodust> you know it, plexi 
[02:03:10] <mfiano> |3b|: i did tell them to use a cloak, but i dont know how to use it
[02:03:29] <mfiano> that was one of the questions on the registration form that i answered anyway
[02:03:56] <|3b|> mfiano: yeah, i looked at the cloak stuff and it looked like too much effort :p (too much effort is a pretty low threshold for me though)
[02:05:34] <mfiano> i know i had a cloak on old network but no idea how i set it up :)
[02:06:43] <mfiano> yeah i think the issue was that connections required sasl and web client doesn't support sasl :)
[02:07:02] <mfiano> it's amazing how fast that network devolved
[02:07:02] <|3b|> looks like "group contacts" "will have a standing invite to #libera-communities where you may request cloaks for projects that you are a registered GC for."
[02:07:26] * |3b| doesn't seem to have an invite there, so looks like it might have missed group contacts in addition to admins when project was created
[02:07:35] <mfiano> hmm
[02:07:56] <mfiano> i will talk to staff later about getting group contacts added to our org
[02:08:09] <mfiano> i thought that was auto set up with the registration questions i answered
[02:09:06] <borodust> sasl is apparently a really nice thing
[02:09:20] <borodust> when used with znc especially
[02:09:26] <borodust> and too hard to setup
[02:09:33] <borodust> *not too hard ;p
[02:09:44] <mfiano> just uses a vps, like |3b| apparantly
[02:10:23] <borodust> i mean, i use it too :)
[02:10:38] <mfiano> dont use any znc software. just mosh
[02:11:05] <technomancy> mosh is underrated
[02:11:38] <borodust> i'm not that hardcore
[02:12:55] <mfiano> i don't really understand znc. 99% of my apps are cli/tui anyway...don't need added complexity
[02:12:56] <borodust> i mean, i host my znc in personal kubernetes, but i feel like i'm still not enough core for mobile shells xD
[02:13:26] * |3b| only connects from a relatively stable/fast connection, so normal ssh is good enough for me
[02:13:31] <borodust> i have termux installed, but really, typing anything is a huge pain

[02:15:19] <edgar-rft> borodust: hmm, how do you surf the internet with no access to servers?
[02:15:49] <borodust> oh wait, mosh is not about mobile devices aint it D:
[02:16:10] <mfiano> its termcaps are kinda screwy. only matters if you use some obscure vte inside mosh and try to run vim/nvim and colors are all wonky.
[02:16:13] <borodust> edgar-rft: i press buttons and content flows into my eyes
[02:17:11] <mfiano> borodust: put simply, mosh is ssh over udp for roaming laptops etc
[02:17:12] <borodust> or better, i press my fingers onto a shiney glass for the content to flow into my eyes
[02:17:53] <mfiano> i use it home too, because sometimes connection is flaky and i don't want to reconnect....just let it find the connection again when it becomes active :)

[23:00:22] <borodust> well, maybe we can get systems one by one: cl-bodge/engine, cl-bodge/resources, cl-bodge/host, cl-bodge/graphics, trivial-gamekit
[23:01:29] <mister_m> so normally ql qould tell me it is fetching a tar and how many systems it needs to load but I'm not seeing that qhen quickloading :ql-bodge or :trivial-gamekit -- maybe this is a quicklisp client problem of some kind 
[23:02:07] <borodust> i often hear this problem from ppl using windows
[23:02:17] <borodust> same symptoms
[23:02:31] <borodust> you are like first to report this behavior from linux-based os ;p
[23:02:35] <mister_m> let me ensure I have the latest client as well 
[23:03:07] <mister_m> (I do appear to have the latest client accordng to the (ql:update-client) output)
[23:03:39] <borodust> mister_m: what (uiop:implementation-identifier) says
[23:03:47] <mfiano> It's a big problem on Linux for me too
[23:03:57] <borodust> mfiano: with gamekit?
[23:03:58] <mfiano> It has to grovel all of the asd files in the dist
[23:04:10] <mfiano> so particularly noticable on NFS or slow FS's
[23:04:28] <mfiano> I dont use QL anymore because of this and other issues :)
[23:04:38] <borodust> ah, i see what you mean
[23:04:54] <borodust> well, dist software kinda indexed so it shouldn't try too hard
[23:05:02] <borodust> i never checked though
[23:05:31] <mfiano> it re-indexes everything whenever local-projects changes
[23:05:37] <mfiano> Takes a good 2 minutes to quickload something when i add a new project
[23:05:39] <mfiano> for me
[23:06:20] <borodust> ah, well, this seems to be something else, gamekit is distrubuted via custom quicklisp dist
[23:06:34] <borodust> no need to do local-projects trickery
[23:06:50] <mfiano> or i should say, whenever anything in asdf's registry changes
[23:06:58] <mfiano> since quicklisp just appends itself at the end

[23:17:01] <dto> borodust: no plans yet but I will be home on Thursday
[23:17:36] <borodust> mister_m: that's super new
[23:17:56] <mister_m> I actually updated from 2.1.4 just to see if there would be any change 
[23:18:15] <borodust> damn, i'm really sad you are having subpar experience quickloading gamekit D:
[23:18:49] <borodust> lemme see, maybe be something broken in my infrastructure
[23:19:11] <mister_m> don't feel like you gotta drop everything 
[23:21:30] <borodust> hmm, well, it hanged for like 3-5 seconds for me but then started downloading tars
[23:23:12] <borodust> mister_m: try this curl download command:
[23:23:14] <borodust> $ curl -L http://bodge.borodust.org/dist/org.borodust.bodge/archive/nuklear-blob-20200824142331.tgz --output /dev/null
[23:23:25] <borodust> does it start downloading immediately?
[23:23:41] *** Joins: zap (~zap@gateway/tor-sasl/zap)
[23:25:21] <mister_m> borodust: it does 
[23:26:00] <borodust> dayum
[23:26:26] <borodust> lemme hop into #commonlisp for a second
[23:27:20] <borodust> dto: me and Tatrix are planning to make a game using alien-works, wanna jump in?)
[23:31:52] <borodust> mister_m: well, for now, i suggest running sbcl from terminal and loading gamekit, and forgetting about it for a half an hour ;p
[23:32:41] <borodust> there's another way to get gamekit running, but i don't really want anyone to take it
