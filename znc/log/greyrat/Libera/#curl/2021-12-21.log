[15:12:13] <bagder> jfuller: on the subject of h3 issues, just pick any of the flaws and go with it. Like one that you feel is the most fun or easiest from your point of view
[15:13:21] <icing> bagder: but I'll start with some sabbatical time, just diddling around. at least, that's the plan. See how long it stands. =)
[15:13:57] <bagder> cool, I did the same when I quit mozilla and I enjoyed that a lot

[15:22:22] <bagder> I wonder what the easiest working http3 server for toying around locally is
[15:22:40] <bagder> quiche provides one in their example dir but it crashes too much
[15:34:43] <bagder> here, tomorrow will be 3 seconds longer than today as we start the climb to lighter times

[19:23:57] <bagder> yeps, now one of the oss-fuzz issues from yesterday repaired itself... :-/
[19:24:50] <icing> maybe they could randomly modify curl until it passes their tests?
[19:25:04] <bagder> fuzzy development! I like it
[19:25:20] <bagder> fuzzopment
[19:25:50] <icing> now it fuzzes back!
[19:26:55] <icing> "when we detect fuzzing, we randomly flip bits in our code. security analysis prevention."
[19:27:25] <bagder> and now I try to understand how to run caddy as a h3 server
[19:27:32] <bagder> never tried it before
[19:27:37] <icing> mholt made you do it, I saw
[19:27:53] <bagder> I figured I should at least check it out
[19:28:11] <bagder> first thing it does is trying to bind to port 443 even if I didn't tell it to
[19:28:19] <bagder> which fails because I run it as a mere user
[19:28:24] <bagder> and then it exits...
[19:28:44] <icing> it is safe with many useful defaults, is the idea I guess
[19:28:52] <bagder> yeah I think so
[19:29:06] <bagder> I'm not that kind of user =)
[19:29:39] <icing> ah, with your famous persistence, you'll wrestle it into something useful, I'm sure.
[19:30:28] <bagder> well, as I have a working h3 setup, this is just extra so depending on how much friction I will face...
[19:31:02] <icing> and there is h3 and then there is tatsuhiro's h3...
[19:32:05] <bagder> right, I actually don't even know which h3 caddy runs with
[20:01:55] <bagder> now it works
[20:02:04] <bagder> and it is actually even slower...
