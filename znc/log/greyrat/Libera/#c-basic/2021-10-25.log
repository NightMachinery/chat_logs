[00:32:40] <Klinda> what beginner resources do you advise?
[00:33:02] <Klinda> I just wanna learn wrting safe C code, avoiding all the vurnerabilites
[00:33:07] <Klinda> like format strings
[00:34:33] <Klinda> for example now I am reading on web that strlen is not safe to use cause it doesn't handle string that are not \0 terminated

[14:57:49] <Plazma> Klinda: well you're going to have to do unsafe C code to properly learn safe c code, and that's a bit of a misonmer 
[14:57:53] <Plazma> you can learn safe practices but yea
[14:59:21] <Plazma> Klinda: typically in that case, i belive if you include the actual null terminator in your C-string, then that's undefined behavior
[15:44:11] <Klinda> I was doing some exercises 
[15:45:46] <Klinda> that's what I did this moring https://dpaste.org/hgGJ
[15:46:56] <Klinda> Plazma: what if an attacker run the function and overflow/exploit it?
[15:51:05] <Plazma> well they have to get access to it while in memory first
[15:51:27] <Plazma> which that requires exploiting operating system protection measures, user exploitatoin, etc
[15:53:04] <Klinda> I mean one thing is to know how to write the code correctly to avoid bugs one thing is to just program in a bad way (all can program in C)
