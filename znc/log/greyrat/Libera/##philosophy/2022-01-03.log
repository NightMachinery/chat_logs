[11:58:40] <krb> free will isn't really a defined concept
[11:59:15] <krb> that's like being some kind of magical being that can move and see beyond the limits of the universe
[11:59:45] <Descartes> Laplace's demon is really interesting.  This came from Pierre-Simone Laplace
[11:59:57] <krb> if there would be true free will, we could live forever. fly out in the universe without the requirements of spaceships...
[12:00:06] <Descartes> sorry, Pierre-Simon Laplace
[12:01:34] <causative> we make choices - choices are physical actions that happen in our brains, like how computers can execute "if/then" statements. We make the choice; our brain makes the choice. We are the brain making the choice.
[12:02:06] <Descartes> Actually, Sean Carroll does recognize free will as an important element in the universe, even though he's a mathematician and cosmologist who focuses most of his discussions on the many worlds hyptothesis

[12:03:16] <krb> consciousness and "choices" might not be as special as we like to delude ourselves to think
[12:03:25] <krb> perhaps the delusion is that we think there is such a thing
[12:03:32] <Descartes> But I recently came to realize that our understanding of free will is somehow flawed
[12:03:58] <krb> it's not always what the brain is programmed to think is "best"
[12:04:21] <Descartes> I mean, in the context of the many worlds hypothesis, our macroworld understanding of free will may be flawed
[12:04:51] <krb> mythological brainwashing seem to have given the idea that "free will" exists only when you do good choices
[12:05:25] <krb> then when someone get out from such chains of thoughts, they can be lead to believe that rebellion and evil choices is where they can find freedom
[12:05:32] <causative> the notion of "free will" is very vague and ill-defined and not useful anyway
[12:05:46] <causative> but the notion of "choice" is much clearer and more useful
[12:05:59] <causative> we make choices, computers or robots make choices too, and the process is similar
[12:06:07] <Descartes> I think trying to understand free will is very useful for philosophers
[12:06:26] <krb> somehow it smells like theology
[12:06:31] <Descartes> but we must also explore Laplace's demon, because I think it may show the limits of free will
[12:06:52] <causative> a choice is simply when the system has alternatives available to it, and it selects one of the alternatives by calculating which seems more favorable and selecting that one

[12:25:43] <krb> https://mindmatters.ai/2020/05/physicist-rejects-free-will-and-thus-fails-logic/ Carroll goes on to argue (amazingly) that gravity proves that free will is an illusion:
[12:25:44] <krb>     If you jump out of a window, the laws of physics say that you are going to hit the ground. You can use all of the free will you want, but it’s not going to stop you from hitting the ground. So why would you think that it works any differently when you go to decide what shirt you’re going to wear in the morning? It’s the same laws of physics. It’s just that one case is a more crude prediction and the other case is a more detailed prediction.

[12:28:46] <Descartes> Great weblink
[12:31:28] <Descartes> It's really interesting that a materialist and atheist such as Sean Carroll continually informs his interviewers and admits in his book that free will is real
[12:31:59] <Descartes>  “Let’s talk about free will. Do we have it?” Carroll replies:
[12:32:01] <Descartes>     It’s complicated, and I apologize for that, but it’s worth getting right. The very first question we have to ask is: Are we human beings 100 percent governed by the laws of physics? Or do we, as conscious creatures, have some wiggle room that allows us to act in ways that are outside of the laws of physics? Almost all scientists will tell you that of course it’s the former.
[12:32:02] <Descartes>     Reggie Ugwu, “‘Westworld’ and ‘Devs’ Asked Big Questions. A Physicist Responds.” at New York Times
[12:32:54] <Descartes> Carroll is not one of those scientists that blindly assumes the former.  He recognizes the veracity of the latter
[12:33:26] <Descartes> and he's not afraid to explore free will openly in all his interviews or in his books
[12:34:54] <krb> i believe that theres much about consciousness and the brain we don't understand yet. i just read that there was a discovery that the brain is far more complicated than formerly considered by AI researchers. that they have been thinking about it as simple neural nets. the new discovery show that consciousness might be one abstract above that as well. like a sort of neural net above the neural nets themselves
[12:36:12] <Descartes> What I realized about the limits of free will I think is related to how our decisions create new time lines
[12:36:52] <krb> perhaps we might have to be able to create a synthetic consciousness before we can make the assumption that there is such a thing as free will. just as we would have to understand the inner workings of the universe

[12:37:28] <Descartes> If you accept Laplace's Demon and  the simulation hypothesis, then you may be right that we're not actually changing our environment when we make a decision
[12:37:51] <krb> we can't control quantum particles going backwards in time
[12:38:14] <Descartes> I don't agree with that, but that's a different issue
[12:38:44] <krb> is it because of his book?
[12:39:01] <krb> i should definetly read it at some point
[12:39:11] <metasintactic> physics of free will --> https://www.ams.org/notices/200902/rtx090200226p.pdf
[12:39:36] <Descartes> What I came to realize is that if you have a perfectly set and sttatic universe that is predetermined by the simulation, then the simulation itself is just a movie that gets played by the simulator and we're just participants in the movie
[12:40:12] <Descartes> However, there's a whole bunch of movies running at the same time and those movies interconnect and interact with each other
[12:40:33] <Descartes> hence there's many time lines, as predicted by the many worlds hypothesis
[12:40:59] <krb> theres many theories about the universe. i read that theres a possible evidence that there has been a former universe as well in the background radiation
[12:41:18] <Descartes> and when we make a decision, we're not changing our environment, we're just choosing which time line to enter or create and we have to stay in that time line each time we make a decision
[12:41:23] <krb> what if the particles moving back and which changes things is just some clash with a former universe, and not alternative universes
[12:42:57] <Descartes> the problem is that once the new time line creates a new universe, according to quantum mechanics and many worlds hypothesis, these worlds are not supposed to interact with each other, that's what Sean Carroll says
[12:43:22] <Descartes> so we're dealing with some paradoxes
[12:44:31] <Descartes> actually, if each movie never interacts or connects to any other movie from the moment of its birth, then there shouldn't be any paradoxes
[12:44:51] <Descartes> Movie= independent universe
[12:47:52] <Descartes> For example, at the age of 17, you decide to become a doctor instead of a lawyer, so at the moment of that decision, there are two of you, the one who decided to go into medicine and become a surgeon, and the one who became a defense lawyer.  Both of these people exist in their own time lines, but those time lines permanently separate and nothing you do as a lawyer will affect your other...
[12:47:54] <Descartes> ...life in the other universe where you are a surgeon
[12:48:35] <krb> maybe the former universe was almost like this, and the illusion of consciousness is created by a wave of backward going particles
[12:49:33] <Descartes> I don't think consiousness is an illusion

[12:50:29] <Descartes> the illusion is our perception of uni-dimensional time and our denial of the principles of quantum mechanics
[12:52:15] <Descartes> by the way, Immanual Kant also explores the idea of free will very thoroughly in his books
[12:52:21] *** Joins: pucara (~i@181.91.29.65)
[12:52:45] <Descartes> Read his Critique of Pure Reason
[12:52:55] <Descartes> it was published in 1781
[12:53:09] <Descartes> It's a very important book for all students and teachers of philosophy
[12:53:52] <Descartes> in this book, Kant says, "If everything is just cause and effect, humans have no say in the flow events."
[12:55:57] <causative> obviously wrong, to "have say in the flow of events" means to causally influence them
[12:56:06] <causative> which we can't do *without* cause and effect
[12:58:20] <Descartes> Well, Kant also said that if it's not possible to think of the world as we experience it without the concept of causality, then for the emperical world, every event has a cause.  There is no appearance of human freedom.
[13:00:01] <Descartes> But I believe Kant was rejecting that assumption because he also said the mind is active and playing a part in shaping the world of experience
[13:00:28] <causative> for the mind to be "active and play a part" means for the mind to exert a causal influence
[13:01:12] <Descartes> Kant said  instead of knowledge consisting in our minds conforming to a world of objects, objects must conform to our minds
[13:02:38] <Descartes> the mind categorizes and organizes all it receives in sensory experience in the forms of space and time, which shape this input with cause and substance
[13:05:39] <Descartes> I think you are assuming that everything we do is caused by something else, like biology, genetics or our experiences, is that right?
[13:06:35] <causative> yes and no, that's not the point I'm making
[13:06:58] <causative> the point I'm making is that we *are* the biology - so when the biology causes something, we do
[13:07:08] <causative> we cause it
[13:07:14] <Descartes> however, if we are made of quantum particles, that means there's a certain randomness to our decision-making process that cannot be predicted by the laws of physics that govern the macro world
[13:08:37] <Descartes> and that means we are also governed by probability and the uncertainty principle
[13:09:13] <Descartes> if that's true than you can predict the general course of sb's life, but you cannot predict every little incident or detail in that life with certainty
[13:10:48] <Descartes> and we still have the will power to choose which time line to participate in, such as that 17 year old deciding to become a doctor instead of a lawyer
[13:11:55] <Descartes> Both Immanual Kant and Sean Carroll also recognized that human beings have free will and make moral decisions
[13:12:26] <Descartes> Immanual Kant explores morality in his books, too

[13:14:32] <brigand> my free will ends where my gf's cats start
[13:15:15] <causative> random or not, really makes no difference, because a random choice isn't any more "free will" than a determined choice
[13:15:16] <Descartes> Remember Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative?
[13:15:25] <causative> a coin flip doesn't have free will
[13:16:01] <causative> or the random decay of an atom, also doesn't have free will
[13:16:31] <Descartes> "Act only on the maxim whereby you can at the same time WILL that it should become a universal law."
[13:16:57] <causative> and furthermore the idea that our ability to choose among options results from something totally random is just a misunderstanding of psychology
[13:17:37] <causative> we *want* our choices to be causally determined by our judgment of what is best
[13:18:18] <causative> if our judgment of what is best did not govern our actions, we wouldn't say our will was "free" - we would say we have no control over ourselves and we just act randomly and we wouldn't like it
[13:18:18] <Descartes> Of all the philosophers I have read who describe morality, I think Immanuel Kant has the best understanding of morality
[13:19:08] <Descartes> there are people who do that
[13:19:11] <Descartes> Evil people
[13:19:27] <Descartes> Criminals
[13:19:36] <Descartes> Murderers
[13:19:48] <Descartes> thieves

[13:20:33] <causative> that would be changing the subject
[13:21:00] <Descartes> Kant assumes that free will plays a role in our moral decisions
[13:21:09] <Descartes> But why does he think that?
[13:21:34] <causative> more importantly, why is he wrong?
[13:21:49] <Descartes> Yes, he may be wrong

[13:23:48] <Descartes> Our decisions are based on animal biology and just hormones, chemistry, biology?
[13:23:48] <causative> free will is not a meaningful concept - we act based on our desires, which means something called "our desires" is what *causes* us to act - our behavior determined by these things called "desires." And we *want* this to happen, because if it did not happen, we would act in unproductive and random ways, which we don't want.

[13:24:26] <causative> I agree with it but that's not the argument I'm making
[13:25:30] <Descartes> so the only thing motivating our desires is reproduction and animal instincts with have nothing to do with free will?
[13:25:53] <causative> did I ever mention "reproduction" or "animal instincts"? I did not
[13:26:08] <causative> read what I actually said
[13:26:36] <Descartes> our instincts to survive, reproduce and avoid pain and discomfort, that's all that motivates us?
[13:27:39] <Descartes> in other words, we are just simple animals with no higher order thoughts, or rational thinking?
[13:27:53] <causative> you're not listening to a word I'm saying
[13:29:04] <Descartes> actually, that does make sense. and it's true that if we live in a cause and effect world, then theoretically, everything that we do and all the decisions we make could be predetermined by biology, physics, chemistry, and genetics
[13:29:40] <Descartes> and of course our past experiences predict our future behaviour, which could also be out of our hands
[13:30:25] <Descartes> for example, you have an abused boy who later becomes a murderer.  Did he make a moral decision, or was he just reacting to past abuse without any free will?
[13:31:04] <Descartes> Does the murderer have any moral responsibility for the act of killing his neighbour?
[13:31:50] <Descartes> if the murderer was that same abused boy?
[13:32:28] <Descartes> so accept your criticism of Immanuel Kant
[13:32:52] <causative> that's not "my" criticism
[13:33:02] <Descartes> I mean your rejection of Immanuel Kant's view of the role of free will
[13:33:03] <causative> that's a weak argument you made up yourself
[13:33:32] <Descartes> However, there's another side of the argument
[13:33:49] <Descartes> Immanuel Kant's side of the argument, which is worth exploring
[13:34:34] <Descartes> Do you think Immanuel Kant's books on morality and free will are worth considering?
[13:34:37] <causative> Descartes, let me try one more time
[13:35:07] <causative> proposition 1: "We don't want our actions to be random or unpredictable; it would be unpleasant and undesired if they were."
[13:35:23] <Descartes> yes
[13:35:59] <causative> proposition 2: "We want our actions to be causally determined by something, namely our desires or preferences; it is desirable for our actions to be determined by our desires or preferences."
[13:36:31] <Descartes> No
[13:36:54] <Descartes> It is desirable for our actions to be determined by our moral values
[13:37:18] <Descartes> Not our animal desires
[13:37:28] <causative> did I say one word about "animal" desires, Descartes ?
[13:37:38] <causative> would you stop putting words in my mouth?
[13:37:48] <Descartes> No, I did.  I brought it up, because of Kant's position on morality
[13:38:06] <Descartes> You did not bring it up.
[13:38:11] <causative> okay but I'm trying to communicate to you *my* position on free will, without you completely substituting something else for it
[13:38:48] <Descartes> I accept proposition 1, but reject proposition 2
[13:38:52] <causative> when I say desires, I didn't say "animal" desires - these may be rational and well informed desires, they may in fact be a desire to help the needy, or to write a stirring novel
[13:39:19] <causative> desires are the things that we want - for good reasons or bad
[13:39:29] <Descartes> ok
[13:39:34] <causative> they may be moral, they may be immoral
[13:39:59] <causative> when we say we are intentionally acting, what we mean is that we are acting in accordance with our desires - in other words, that our desires have caused our behavior
[13:40:10] <Descartes> sorry, I should not have interrupted you after proposition 2, because I think you were getting to a conclusion
[13:41:09] <causative> how about you respond to proposition 2 again, now that you understand I'm not talking about "animal" desires, but simply about any kind of preference that causes a person to favor one action over another?
[13:41:49] <causative> the preference could be instinctual in nature, or it could be rational; it could be moral, it could be immoral
[13:42:12] <Descartes> yes
[13:42:19] <causative> so you agree with proposition 2 now?
[13:42:42] <Descartes> yes
[13:43:29] <causative> okay. Then let's say proposition 3: When a person says "free will," they are referring to a state of affairs in which they seem to have control over their actions - or more precisely, in which their desires or preferences exert causal control over their actions.
[13:43:55] <Descartes> yes, I agree
[13:44:06] <causative> well, then free will has nothing to do with randomness
[13:44:22] <Descartes> yes
[13:44:27] <krb> what made a person choose what he did when he finally chooses then?
[13:44:30] <causative> if we can trace the causal chain of behavior, fully deterministically, this in no way invalidates "free will"
[13:45:03] <Descartes> No, I disagree
[13:45:27] <Descartes> think of that abused boy who becomes a murderer
[13:45:33] <causative> you agreed that free will is a state of affairs in which desires or preferences exert causal control over their actions
[13:45:45] <Descartes> yes

[13:47:22] <Descartes> for example, that abused boy who commits murder as an adult.  You could argue that it was not his desire to kill his neighbour, but he did it in a drug fuelled rage and in response to years of abuse from his parents
[13:48:20] <causative> when he was in the rage, he certainly desired to kill his neighbor, did he not?
[13:48:54] <causative> why did he lift the knife if he didn't want to? was his body moving by itself?
[13:49:13] <Descartes> at the moment he committed the murder, he was acting out of animalistic desire, I think, not a rational desire
[13:49:44] <causative> well, when I speak of desires I am speaking of any kind of desire, "animalistic" or "rational" - it is hard to separate the two anyway
[13:50:01] <Descartes> But I thought you would agree with me that that's a good example of behaviour that does not involve free will
[13:50:30] <Descartes> oh, that would be krb's position
[13:50:44] <arryana> people are responsible for their actions.  if they cannot be responsible, they should be confined or curtailed so that their lack of responsibility cannot harm others.
[13:51:03] <causative> let's try proposition 4. a person's desires or preferences are the causal result of other desires or preferences, and his beliefs
[13:51:07] * arryana thinks this 'blame parents for everything' nonsense has got to stop
[13:51:14] <Descartes> so, I was playing the devil's advocate on behalf of krb

[13:52:16] <krb> eventually whatever we chooses the same results will come. death
[13:52:17] <arryana> if people don't grow up to be functional, reasonable people with consequences, they should be trated like the children they insist on being.

[13:52:57] <causative> "seeing the sign for the ice cream shop" and "considering when I last ate" are mental sequences of events that precede and cause my desire for an ice cream cone
[13:53:46] <causative> then once I have the desire, I choose to enter the shop, instead of continuing on my way - this choice made because I want the ice cream more than I want to continue on my way
[13:53:57] <causative> this is how the will operates
[13:54:06] <causative> it is good that I do this
[13:54:09] <Descartes> actually, I think we all agree that free will plays an important role in morality and all our moral decisions, and krb is the only one who honestly rejects that
[13:54:45] <causative> imagine that, wanting an ice cream cone, and preferring it to all other options, even considering the health effect and the cost of the cone, I did *not* enter the shop; this would be against my wishes
[13:54:58] <krb> what is "moral" depends on programming
[13:55:00] <Descartes> I was just playing the devil's advocate because I thought we were indulging in a counter-argument against Immanuel Kant's position on morality and free will
[13:55:00] <causative> my desire would not control my action, and I would feel out of control - my will would not be acting "freely"
[13:55:20] <krb> if it's moral to hang and burn someone who isn't partaking in a mythological delusion, then that is what is considered morally good
[13:55:22] <krb> and sane
[13:55:47] <krb> religion is evidence that people are easily programmed
[13:56:16] <causative> Descartes, my position is that "free will" is not a meaningful concept and it is best not spoken of, but "will" and "choice" and "decision" are meaningful things that we do all the time, and that depends on a strong chain of mental causation, not on randomness
[13:56:56] <causative> I have been talking about "free will" as someone who believes in it might view it, but really I don't like the term

[13:57:22] <Descartes> ok, that's good, now I understand your position and it's similar to that of krb?
[13:58:01] <causative> we may view this as the "psychological" perspective on choices:  choices are the result of a chain of mental causation, from beliefs and desires (not "animal" desires) causing other desires which eventually cause an action
[13:58:19] <Descartes> also, I want to know if causative believes in the veracity of those 4 propositions?
[13:58:25] <causative> and that it is good, and functional, that this should happen, and it would be bad if randomness entered the process
[13:58:36] <causative> yes, they are propositions I agree with
[13:59:20] <Descartes> ok, so how do you respond to Immanuel Kant's position on free will and morality?
[13:59:33] <Descartes> in particular, his categorical imperative
[14:00:12] <causative> the categorical imperative doesn't lead to clear conclusions on how to act
[14:00:38] <Descartes> I think it does, and it does not accept any exceptions to the rule

[14:01:14] <Descartes> yes
[14:02:25] <Descartes> Why do you think this statement was made by Kant and how do you think it relates to his concept of free will?
[14:03:19] <causative> I like to use the example of a guy named Marty Q. Evans with social security number 4438830939 who would like to act according to the maxim, "People with social security numbers divisible by 4438830939 should steal TVs when they want to."

[14:05:14] <causative> but he does seem to be following the categorical imperative
[14:05:33] <Descartes> At first, I did not like it, but when I gave it a lot of thought and considered it as a response, to David Hume, then it made more sense and I eventually accepted Kant's position on morality in particular
[14:06:40] <causative> the categorical imperative doesn't seem to have any rigorous way to prevent people from just making up some maxim that justifies whatever they were doing and that applies narrowly enough that it wouldn't really change society if applied universally
[14:06:45] <Descartes> Marty is not following the categorical emperative, because his law is not universal to all rational human beings
[14:07:34] <causative> why, because it applies only under the conditions that the person has SSN divisible by 4438830939?
[14:07:41] <Descartes> Also, when you consider Hegel, Kant's position on morality makes a lot of sense and seems rational and consistent
[14:08:42] <causative> what if the maxim is instead, "People working dangerous jobs should wear protective gear when necessary."  Does your objection that this law is "not universal to all rational human beings" apply here as well?
[14:08:57] <causative> because it only applies to people working dangerous jobs
[14:09:47] <Descartes> that maxim should apply to any human being who works a dangerous job
[14:10:11] <causative> "any human being who works a dangerous job" is not the same as "any human being"
[14:10:18] <Descartes> yes
[14:10:38] <causative> so you object to the protective gear maxim as well?
[14:11:13] <Descartes> it's a good maxim, and will save lives, so it should apply to the entire human race
[14:11:35] <Descartes> any human being could work a dangerous job at some point in their life
[14:12:20] <causative> and any human being could acquire a SSN divisible by 4438830939 at some point in their life - weird bureaucratic mixups do happen
[14:12:56] <causative> so what is the difference, in your mind, between working a dangerous job, and having a SSN divisible by 4438830939?  why do you object to one being used in a maxim, and not the other?
[14:13:27] <Descartes> the second maxim involviing the SIN is random and not beneficial to the human race
[14:13:55] <causative> "act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law"
[14:14:15] <causative> I don't see anything in there about the maxim not being "random" or about it being beneficial to the human race
[14:14:37] <Descartes> aha, so may be you need to read Kant's book
[14:14:59] <Descartes> Critique of Pure Reason
[14:15:26] <causative> it's my understanding that he thinks that people who follow the CI will, as a *consequence*, adopt maxims beneficial to the human race; he's not saying that a maxim must as a prerequisite be beneficial to the human race or it isn't a valid maxim
[14:15:52] <causative> so you can't object to a maxim on that grounds
[14:15:54] <Descartes> He does make that argument in the book
[14:16:29] <causative> which argument?
[14:16:58] <Descartes> In the book, I believe Kant argues that morality is not based on sentiment or even the consequences of action
[14:17:58] <Descartes> He said doing the right thing is not a matter of one's character or disposition or circumstances - all of which are or might be beyond one's control
[14:18:36] <Descartes> Instead, morality is a matter of duty, acting out of respect for the moral law
[14:18:45] <arryana> nonsense
[14:19:03] <Descartes> And the moral law cannot be hypothetical
[14:19:12] <Descartes> in nature
[14:19:19] <Descartes> Nor conditional
[14:19:46] <krb> i believe conscience is a form of self brainwashing. whatever people brainwash themselves with depends on the social programming
[14:19:49] <causative> but you accepted the maxim about protective equipment, which is conditional on the person working a job in which it is required
[14:20:09] <Descartes> Wants and consequences cannot figure into what is morally right, according to Kant
[14:20:33] <Descartes> yes
[14:20:41] <causative> even a broad maxim like "do not steal" is conditional; stealing is taking an item *when* the item is owned by someone else *and* the item was not given to you in trade *and* the item was not given as a gift *and* there is no other legal reason for you to take the item
[14:20:47] <causative> all sorts of conditions
[14:21:31] <Descartes> Instead of wants and consequences, Kant said the law itself must be categorical
[14:21:50] <Descartes> the moral law is categorical
[14:22:10] <arryana> the macheguinga tribe take disabled infants and put a stick across their neck and step on it.  this is 'moral' in their culture.  other cultures mutilate the genitals of boys or girls, to them it is 'moral'
[14:22:14] <Descartes> "Do this. Or don't do that." is categorical
[14:22:31] <Descartes> Not, "If you want this, do that."
[14:22:33] <arryana> but these are nowhere near universal enough to make the argument that there's anything like a 'moral law' that applies to everyone
[14:23:05] <causative> it's not a clear concept Descartes , because every word we use can be broken down and seen as a group of associated conditions
[14:23:12] <causative> like, as I said, "stealing" can be
[14:23:25] <krb> if we did like the universe we would clone people, make them grow old and suffer and die
[14:23:37] <krb> that's how i see the universal morality
[14:23:46] <Descartes> Kant is arguing that we are willing the moral laws and respecting them by behaving according to the laws that we will to be true and universal
[14:23:50] <krb> if i were to be moral, i would help the universe conclude quicker
[14:24:09] <causative> it's not consistent, anyway, is my take
[14:24:14] <krb> not that i want to be moral in that respect
[14:24:35] <arryana> i've seen this 'conversation' too many times in this channel to engage in it further.
[14:24:37] <arryana> it's boring as hell.
[14:24:42] <causative> my view on morality is related but more like this:  act according to a set of rules which would result in a more desirable society overall if adopted universally
[14:25:03] <Descartes> by making moral decisions, you are acting out in the flesh, the moral laws that we will to be true and universal for yourself and for others
[14:25:11] <causative> the key is that it's not whether I can "will" people to follow the rules - because I might choose very self-serving rules and will that everyone follow them
[14:25:22] <causative> it's about whether the rules actually benefit society, according to some global metric
[14:25:23] <krb> if we had a doomsday device, something that could end the universe or atleast humanity. would it be moral to use it or not to?
[14:25:48] <causative> of course it would be evil to use it krb
[14:25:56] <krb> "end all suffering with one click"
[14:26:01] <causative> end all happiness too
[14:26:08] <causative> and all science and philosophy
[14:26:29] <causative> it's better to let the individuals choose if they want to live or die today - and people keep choosing to "live"
[14:26:33] <krb> what good would any of that if it all will come to a end
[14:27:23] <causative> well, imagine you have a delicious milkshake and you're in the desert and you're dying of thirst and no one will come to save you
[14:27:27] <krb> there seem to be very few people that care to figure out a way to prolong their life or "live forever"
[14:27:46] <causative> is it better to drink the milkshake, knowing that it will all come to an end soon? or not to drink it, because the milkshake is useless, can't save you in the end?
[14:27:46] <Descartes> I think Kant is a very thorough philosopher, and his arguments are very compelling, and that's why his book, Critique of Pure Reason has been a dominating theme in philosophy classrooms for almost 300 years
[14:28:15] <causative> I say it is better to drink the milkshake; good things end, that doesn't make them not good
[14:28:31] <arryana> people would do better to not waste so much of the time they have, rather than seek to have more years to waste
[14:28:53] <krb> that sounds like the argument "we can appreciate the rose more when we know it will wither"
[14:29:11] <causative> well, maybe we can appreciate the rose more, but that's not what I'm saying
[14:29:13] <arryana> not to me.  but if that's how it sounds to you, okay
[14:29:22] <causative> I'm saying we can appreciate it *in spite* of the fact it will wither
[14:29:36] <causative> it doesn't become less beautiful in the present just because it goes away in the future
[14:29:51] <krb> to know all our descendants will die, to have them breathed to just exist for a finite time. to know life and then face death just to loose it into a eternal void
[14:30:05] <krb> *breeded
[14:30:24] <causative> most people aren't suicidal
[14:30:26] <arryana> everything's finite.  i don't see the big deal in that
[14:30:30] <Descartes> Also, I like the way Sean Carroll kind of responds to Immanuel Kant's ideas about free will and morality, because Carroll is a materialist and an atheist.  By the way, was Kant a Christian?
[14:30:41] <causative> so most people prefer to keep living - they think the suffering isn't so bad
[14:31:09] <causative> why then would you go against their wishes, and kill them?
[14:31:29] <krb> i believe most people walk around with a delusion where they think they will go on after they die
[14:31:48] <arryana> who cares what 'most people' believe?
[14:31:55] <arryana> i mean, believe what you want and let others do the same
[14:32:06] <arryana> what's the point of being invested in other people's choices?
[14:32:19] <causative> because krb was talking about killing everyone, arryana ; we should consult the people being killed first, give them a vote
[14:32:57] <krb> religions have programmed huge masses throughout multiple generations to seek death
[14:33:06] <causative> krb, perhaps a majority of people do that, but I don't think it's fair to say that all atheists are suicidal
[14:33:10] <causative> or even that most atheists are suicidal
[14:33:23] <arryana> i think you're overstating the situation a lot, krb
[14:33:31] <causative> suicidal tendencies aren't about what you think happens after death - they're about chemicals and emotions
[14:34:05] <causative> if you believe life ends at death, but you have the right chemicals and emotions, you won't want to die or be particularly unhappy

[14:35:11] <causative> personally I believe the concept of "death" is a bit vague, because consciousness is not a single unbroken line
[14:35:27] <causative> we go to sleep, our attention drifts, we change our minds and who we are over time
[14:36:05] <causative> in a certain sense we die every second of every day, because the exact person we were a second ago no longer exists, because our minds change
[14:36:14] <krb> yeah

[14:37:05] <arryana> death is just a fact.  not a thing to either seek or fear.
[14:37:15] <arryana> wasting what time we have is a much bigger deal.
[14:38:18] <causative> a person's "true self" is what he ultimately, really wants - his goal above all other goals, that he probably hasn't even figured out fully yet
[14:38:57] <causative> as long as other people share that same ultimate goal, those other people are other versions of his true self
[14:39:13] <causative> and he has not died
[14:40:06] <arryana> are you happy, krb?  is your life what you would consider fulfilled?
[14:40:27] <causative> I say this is what the "true self" is, because everything about a person *other* than that ultimate goal - the person's body, the person's clothes, the person's training, the person's intelligence - are all only tools, in service to his goals
[14:40:43] <causative> even his lesser goals, like starting the car in the morning, is a tool to a greater goal
[14:40:55] <krb> somehow my life is completely unexpected. somehow by "choice" as well. choosing a different path beside the dreamed life just to see the consequences..

[14:41:17] <krb> i've drifted for a couple a decades now just to hope and see a glimmer of "free will"
[14:41:24] <causative> so what is left, after we take away all the "tools," to find the true person, is that ultimate goal that is in service to no other goals

[15:01:16] <arryana> that's another discussion that i have seen here hundreds of times in the last four years.  i'm not interested in hashing it over again.
[15:01:57] <Descartes> I understand krb's position on free will and morality, but I don't think you have ever expressed your position, arryana

[15:04:50] <Descartes> wow, arryana, it sounds like you are saying that krb is wrong to deny his own free will

[16:11:42] <Descartes> or even better, view the Earth from the ISS
[16:13:16] <Descartes> But you can view photos from electron microscopes of the coronavirus
[16:15:31] <Descartes> may be some of the those photos could be digitally enhanced or faked, but if you're viewing dozens or hundreds of photos from electron microscopes around the world from various medical authorities, it becomes obvious that all those sources or consistently showing the same phenomena
[16:18:25] <krb> maybe some people just need to see it themselves
[16:18:31] <krb> they should open up labs to such people
[16:19:26] <arryana> they don't lack evidence.  they lack the will to change their lives in the response to it.
[16:19:37] <arryana> it's easier to just deny the whole thing.
[16:19:44] <Descartes> they would proably be forced to confront the reality of those coronaviruses if they visited those research labs
[16:20:03] <arryana> they wouldn't recognize it if their own mother was in the icu with it.

[16:21:37] <arryana> if your mother chooses to keep seeing her
[16:22:08] <arryana> she has a choice to make too
[16:22:11] <Descartes> My mom told my sister several times that she needs to get vaccinated if she wants to visit her, but my sister keeps insisting she doesn't have Covid and doesn't need to get vaccinated
[16:22:27] <arryana> then your mother needs to make good on her statement and not open the door to her.
[16:22:47] <Descartes> and the last time she visited my mom, she wasn't even wearing a mask and she hugged my Mom and my mom let her do it
[16:23:07] <Descartes> My brother was there and tried to stop it

[16:32:38] <Descartes> We can have rational discussions about religion, politics, cooking, car maintenance and money, but we can't have a rational discussion about vaccination
[16:32:56] <arryana> just because someone has an education doesn't exempt them from stupidity and denial

[19:14:22] <audrey> It's notoriously difficult to enforce non-logging rules anyway which is why we don't have one.

[19:29:11] <Descartes> which comes in handy, if sb gets kickbanned and they want to find out why or what happened to cause the ban
[19:29:12] <audrey> According to terms of use, it appears that libera does not default to prohibiting public logging. https://libera.chat/policies/
[19:29:12] <ro-bot-o> [url] Network policies | Libera Chat | libera.chat
[19:29:16] <pussipupu> many had an official log, and I'm sure many here do

[19:29:31] <audrey> But it's not worded very strongly
[19:29:45] <audrey> >
[19:29:45] <audrey> If you operate a service that scrapes internal channel content or published logs, ensure that you have obtained permission to do so from Libera Chat staff or the channel owners before you start scraping data, also make sure that there is an easy way for channels to opt-out.

[19:29:49] <audrey> [END quote]
[19:30:54] <audrey> my default policy in ##philosophy is neither to outright prohibit public logging, nor ever give consent to public log
[19:31:06] <Descartes> But does anyone here keep private logs of chat conversations using their chat client for personal use?
[19:31:06] <audrey> mostly this has been due to unsavory types in past years
[19:31:31] <pussipupu> I strongly dislike that wording but would tend to interpret it as a default prohibition
[19:31:52] <audrey> My wording or libera's?

[19:32:52] <pussipupu> Libera's
[19:33:23] <Descartes> in this case, I was writing in my journal and scrolling back up my Chat client, to see what I had said about Immanuel Kant's views on free will and morality
[19:34:09] <Descartes> I figured I could just find it by viewing my chat logs, because it happened last night and it's no longer in my chat client
[19:35:46] <Descartes> But I just discovered the chat logs are missing, and you have to individually set logging for each channel
[19:36:06] *** Joins: Gerula (~Gerula@user/gerula)
[19:36:14] <Descartes> instead of just set universal logging for all the Libera channels
[19:36:17] <pussipupu> I can't easily log with my current setup or I probably would
[19:37:00] <Descartes> but with Linux, the logging works better and automatically records everything if you set it to universally log everything from the Libera chat network

[20:18:28] <audrey> This is what I was thinking of
[20:18:30] <darklambda> that's her
[20:18:35] <darklambda> i was thinking the same
[20:18:36] <audrey> My voice is about average I think?
[20:18:47] <audrey> I guess I could make it sound lower but it would sound silly
[20:18:56] <darklambda> me too.. hehe
[20:19:27] <audrey> it sounds a bit lower when I speak in Russian vs. English
[20:19:36] <darklambda> my colleagues who know me would spot... but i guess i can do for some functional purposes.. 5min speech or something
[20:19:36] <audrey> I don't know why, exactly. probably some psychological explanation
[20:20:08] <darklambda> yeah.. i have a hunch there might be some psychological explanation too
[20:20:39] <darklambda> maybe in the caveman days, the lower voice peeps who says ugh the lowest are usually stronger
[20:20:50] <darklambda> hence, the view on confidence and power

[21:50:48] <Descartes> I agree with biys that the fight between Black Mamba and Gogo Yubari is the best fight scene in that movie
[21:52:22] <Descartes> I've probably seen that fight about a dozen times.  It's fun to watch.
[21:58:02] <Descartes> Two sexy, confident and skilled fighters going at it without any fear.  It's also entertaining to see them get tested to their physical limits.
[21:59:15] *** Joins: gioyik (~gioyik@gateway/tor-sasl/gioyik)
[21:59:19] <audrey> IDK, Tarantino is just completely unrealistic to me
[21:59:28] <audrey> It´s all about the spectacle
[21:59:49] <pussipupu> It's very theatrical, not intended to be realistic I think
[21:59:57] <audrey> oh yes, our martial arts experts happen to be women, and they also happen to be completely stacked
[22:00:00] <Descartes> It's a brutal fight, and it's obvious at the beginning of the fight that neither of them will win without some serious injuries, but they fight fearlessly and intensely
[22:00:17] <audrey> I mean, fair enough, pussipupu
[22:00:20] <pussipupu> And things like Kill Bill are Tropes-To-Eleven with the odd subversion thrown in
[22:00:36] <audrey> I guess it´s just not my taste
[22:00:54] <pussipupu> Do you prefer realist cinema in general?
[22:01:01] <audrey> Yes
[22:01:30] <pussipupu> Hmm, I think I enjoy both ends, and most points, of the spectrum about equally
[22:02:57] <pussipupu> And in fact the films I mentioned earlier, Koirat Eivät Käytä Housuja is very theatrical, and at times grotesque(in both senses), and Aurora is a pretty realist slice-of-life
[22:03:27] <Descartes> What about the fights in the film 300: Rise of an Empire?  I think those fights are more realistic but no less spectacular.
[22:04:05] <pussipupu> I've not seen it, so can't comment
[22:04:38] <pussipupu> I saw about fifteen minutes of the first 300 film, and then got distracted talking to a friend who was on the bar
[22:05:02] * arryana pushes a beer over to pussipupu
[22:05:21] * pussipupu pushes a bear over to arryana
[22:05:27] <arryana> haha, ta
[22:05:38] <Descartes> I think the best fight scene in that 300 movie happens at the beginning of the movie
[22:06:34] <Descartes> speaking of great fight scenes, I just found out that they released Atomic Blonde 2, which I haven't seen yet
[22:06:57] <Descartes> Charlize Theron is probably in it again
[22:07:53] <pussipupu> Clearly we have quite different taste in films

[22:09:40] <Descartes> omg that fight scene is brutal
[22:11:21] <Descartes> Realistic enough for ya?
[22:12:45] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[22:12:46] <arryana> fight scenes are boring.  they're cliche.
[22:14:48] <pussipupu> I'm not interested in watching a ten minute fight scene at the moment
[22:15:26] <pussipupu> Fight scenes are often cliche, but I think they can be done wrong
[22:15:35] <pussipupu> *done well
[22:15:59] <pussipupu> Apparently I'm disagreeing with everyone about cinema tonight :þ
[22:17:45] <arryana> you're more than entitled to an opinion. i just don't see much entertainment in fake fights.
[22:18:04] <arryana> a good boxing match i can get into.  but pseudo-fights are just duller than dishwater, to me
[22:18:42] <pussipupu> Oh, I'm not complaining, disagreement is a good thing
[22:19:31] <Descartes> Don't judge the fight until you've seen it
[22:20:04] <arryana> not interested.
[22:20:38] * arryana is listening to an audiobook and knitting
[22:21:40] <pussipupu> I'm listening to a podcast (though it's a reading of a short story) and doing CAD
[22:22:01] <Descartes> But I also agree that a good boxing match is very entertaining, especially when the two opponents are equally skilled, and show a lot of courage, skill and clever tactics
[22:22:23] <pussipupu> I don't watch boxing, but I don't watch sport
[22:23:22] <arryana> i wouldn't go out of my way to watch one.  if it's on someone else's tv i'll glance over.
[22:23:52] <pussipupu> I also feel uncomfortable with boxing because of the brain damage associated with it
[22:23:58] <pussipupu> Though bare-knuckle is better in that respect
[22:24:10] <arryana> fair enough.
[22:24:56] <arryana> my father boxed, and taught us as kids, so i have an appreciation for it i wouldn't otherwise
[22:24:57] <pussipupu> If everyone is in a position to give informed and free consent then they can do what they like, but I don't find it entertaining to watch
[22:25:23] <pussipupu> I watched some of the sailing, and a smattering of other stuff, from the last Olympics
[22:25:25] <Descartes> Boxing is fun.  I've tried it myself.  Me and a friend put on boxing gloves and went at it.
[22:25:38] <pussipupu> But that's quite exceptional for me
[22:28:01] <Descartes> I'll try any sport if it looks fun
[22:30:53] <arryana> swatting at someone wearing boxing gloves is not boxing
[22:31:09] *** Joins: Treefingers (~Glassbox@34.162.189.80.dyn.plus.net)
[22:31:14] <arryana> not any more than smacking a tennis ball with a bat is baseball
[22:31:17] <audrey> if you want the kind of violence in movies that I like, a good example would be Straw Dogs (the original, not the remake)
[22:31:29] <audrey> or Texas Chainsaw Massacre
[22:31:31] <arryana> haven't seen that
[22:31:32] <arryana> or that
[22:31:41] <Descartes> I think bare knuckle fighting is more dangerous then boxing.  I've tried both of them and boxing was way more fun.
[22:32:23] <Descartes> The best boxers are incredibly strong, have remarkable speed, reflexes and stamina, and they also have good balance and footwork
[22:32:28] <pussipupu> I've not seen Straw Dogs, I /think/ I've seen TCM but don't really remember it
[22:32:35] <pussipupu> Vague memories of gore?
[22:33:27] <Descartes> that's why boxers have to train so much.  If they don't train properly before a fight, they can get seriously injured in a boxing match
[22:34:37] <pussipupu> I don't think anyone was claiming that sportsfolk weren't skilled
[22:35:09] <Descartes> boxing is a very serious contact sport that really tests your courage, and mental and physical strength and endurance
[22:36:10] <pussipupu> OK
[22:38:17] <Descartes> the kind of violence in Texas Chainsaw Massacre is cruel, disgusting and disturbing, nothing like the violence you see in a good boxing match, where each opponent has a fighting chance and does not expect to die at the end of the fight
[22:39:39] <Descartes> Most boxers show respect to their opponent, and will not try to finish him off after knock out, or when the bell rings or the referee intervenes
[22:39:39] <audrey> well I guess this goes back to my preference for realism in film
[22:40:03] <audrey> 1970s films somehow seem much more viscerally violent than the CGI stuff that comes out today
[22:40:26] <audrey> like the scene in The Exorcist where the possessed girl does unmentionable things to a bloodied crucifix
[22:40:32] <audrey> That would probably be sanitized today
[22:41:04] <Descartes> the Exorcist is not really about physical violence
[22:41:41] <Descartes> It's about emotional and mental violence
[22:43:13] <arryana> i'm just not a fan of media in general.  i'll watch something that's pretty, or creative, instructive, or sociologically compelling.  but not much else.
[22:44:33] <pussipupu> I consume media most of my waking hours, outside work at least
[22:44:40] <pussipupu> Mostly in the form of podcasts
[22:44:44] <Descartes> there's nothing CGI in Atomic Blonde
[22:47:15] <Descartes> Actually, the Exorcist is a very entertaining movie.  It's a very creepy and disturbing horror film that probably gave me nightmares
[22:47:55] <Descartes> and if you're a Christian, it's very hard to watch

[23:09:50] <Descartes> pixelated garbage.  You can even see the pixels on a small screen.  On a big screen it looks even worse.
[23:11:26] <Descartes> any good film should always be watched on a big screen with at least stereo sound, high definition and good colour, the way the director meant it to be viewed
[23:12:20] <Descartes> surround sound is even better, makes the movie all the more realistic
[23:13:46] <Descartes> I think you get at least 6 speaker surround sound when you see a film at a modern theatre.  I would love to see Dune at an Imax Theatre.
[23:14:50] <pussipupu> Which version of Dune?
[23:14:59] <Descartes> the new one
[23:15:28] <Descartes> by Denis Vilneuve
[23:15:38] <Descartes> probably spelled his name wrong
[23:15:49] <pussipupu> Fair enough, I quite liked it
[23:16:07] <Descartes> I heard it was filmed with special Imax film
[23:16:41] <Descartes> so the film format would be even more high quality than regular HD film
[23:17:08] <Descartes> and it's probably best viewed at an Imax Theatre
[23:18:23] <pussipupu> it was fine on my TV
[23:18:42] <Descartes> oh yeah, I downloaded it already, but I will have to watch it at my friend's house, cause he has a big screen.  We don't have any Imax Theatres where I live now
[23:19:26] <Descartes> but there is a local theatre here
[23:19:40] <Descartes> so, you enjoyed the movie?
[23:20:18] <pussipupu> Yeah, though I might not bother with the rest of them

[23:21:52] <Descartes> oh yeah, but what about Blade Runner, another great film by Denis Villeneuve
[23:22:06] <Descartes> Blade Runner 2049
[23:22:37] <pussipupu> It was alright, yeah
[23:23:02] <Descartes> The original Blade Runner movie is just as good as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep
[23:23:03] <pussipupu> but Blade Runner isn't a film of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep
[23:23:23] <Descartes> Watch the original film from 1982
[23:23:39] <pussipupu> I have
[23:23:46] <pussipupu> many times to be fair, great film
[23:23:49] <Descartes> I read the novel before I watched the movie, and I still thorougly enjoyed the movie
[23:24:23] <pussipupu> But notably it's not a film adaption of the novel
[23:24:26] <Descartes> I watched the movie years after I had read the novel
[23:24:39] <pussipupu> Which is something I've always held in its favour
[23:25:29] <Descartes> You liked the movie more than the novel?  I'm talking about Blade Runner from 1982
[23:26:34] <pussipupu> I like them both, and don't see any value in ranking them
[23:27:48] <Descartes> The plot and characters in the movie are similar to those of the novel, so obviously Blade Runner is in fact an adaptation of the novel to the big screen
[23:28:28] <pussipupu> Agree to disagree, they're pretty profoundly different
[23:28:55] <Descartes> Also, the novel is very short, so they didn't have to do much condensing with the script
[23:29:42] <Descartes> the only significant departure I noticed between the characters in the novel and the characters in the movie was Roy Batty
[23:31:08] <Descartes> in the novel, Roy Batty is Asian in appearance but in the movie he's Germanic/European
[23:32:23] *** Quits: mikey (~mikey@user/mikey) (Quit: gtg)
[23:33:28] <Descartes> that's the only detail I recall being different from the novel.  Oh yeah, but didn't Rick Deckard have a wife in the novel, and I think he was more like a nerdy, too
[23:33:44] <Descartes> more like a nerd
[23:35:10] <pussipupu> I don't know how you come to the conclusion that they're that similar on the level of character
[23:35:16] *** Parts: hut1 (~hut@erinome.uberspace.de) ()
[23:35:19] <Descartes> but the mystery of whether Deckard is a human or replicant is essentially the same in both the movie and the novel
[23:35:36] <pussipupu> but also work is soon and the paths are hell and ice, so I'm going to sleep
