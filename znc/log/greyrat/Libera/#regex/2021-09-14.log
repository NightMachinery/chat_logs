[00:00:30] <OnlineCop> The 2nd capture group would be null/empty, so "$1_$2:\t$3" would result in "Logon Type_[nothing here]: 3"
[00:00:55] <OnlineCop> What are you going to do with things like "New Logon:" where it's on a line of its own?
[00:05:52] <dmaislin> So with New Logon on it's own I am using a different function after the REGEX to prefix it to the fields below per that image that I sent to you DM
[00:06:15] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/3hoXVE/20 did some reformatting for you. :D
[00:06:46] <OnlineCop> Actually, I should have probably done (?:\r?\n|\r) instead of [\r\n] for (?<NEWLINE>) but oh well.
[00:06:46] <dmaislin> Hah!
[00:07:08] <dmaislin> No, feel free to add that final touch!
[00:07:12] <dmaislin> This is interesting
[00:07:16] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/3hoXVE/21
[00:07:41] <OnlineCop> It's going to remove 2+ consecutive newlines. I don't know whether you want that in there.
[00:08:27] <dmaislin> The lines don't matter because it becomes a JSON string at the end
[00:08:45] <OnlineCop> What happens to all the rest of the text?
[00:10:43] <dmaislin> I handle that separately
[00:11:10] <OnlineCop> I see no double quotes in the sample text, so you might just wrap the substitution in "quotes":".." and then on another pass, delete everything not within quotes.
[00:11:26] <OnlineCop> Unless your text actually _WILL_ contain double quotes, of course.
[00:12:00] <OnlineCop> But then you could simply replace $1 with some unique delimiter, and then strip everything else out that don't fall between those delimiters.
[00:12:06] <dmaislin> Since these are Windows events I couldn't paste them as such in the REGEX101 where they contain the \r\n stuff, but you have helped tremendously
[00:16:12] <OnlineCop> I looked at wrapping your SUBSTITUTION in quotes for JSONifying, but notice line 22 would be "Process_Information_Process_Command_Line":"xcopy  /y patch-lists ..\..\Patch\"
[00:16:18] <OnlineCop> And that trailing `\"` worries me.

[00:31:02] <OnlineCop> Version /21 adds another capture group (the leading newline) that version /16 didn't have, so all substitution values would be shifted from $1_$2:\t$3 => $1$2_$3:\t$4 to keep that newline. Removing it, and manually entering the newline into the substitution ( `\n$1_$2:\t$3` ) should work just fine.
[00:33:41] <OnlineCop> It might make the subsequent search-and-replace a lot simpler if you wanted to add some unique delimiters around the substitution in this one, so you could simply strip anything before the leading delimiter, and anything after the trailing one.
[00:34:39] <dmaislin> ok, I muted my zoom, so I will look now

[01:53:04] <theatre_nerd> yeah
[01:53:09] <yitz> wizhurd: xpath might be helpful there
[01:53:15] <theatre_nerd> sorry im a complete noob at this
[01:53:29] <yitz> theatre_nerd: no worries. You don't need a regex to split on a fixed string.
[01:53:32] <theatre_nerd> leraing materials also apreciated
[01:53:38] <theatre_nerd> learning
[01:53:47] <yitz> Look up the "split" method in your language of choice
[01:54:16] <theatre_nerd> Ok thanks, I am programing in Node-red which is js based.
[01:54:38] <yitz> Node/JS have basic string operations
[01:55:08] <anikolov> wizhurd: something like this https://regex101.com/r/kemnCN/2
[01:55:40] <yitz> regex is super useful when you need to process strings when simple string operations aren't sufficient. For splitting a string on a fixed char, regex is overkill and more likely to cause issues than help.
[01:56:35] <wizhurd> thank you anikolov 
[01:56:35] <yitz> If you're using Node and dealing with file paths, you may want the Node path library
[01:56:57] <yitz> May as well do it right and all that
[01:57:07] <anikolov> wizhurd: np
[01:58:19] <theatre_nerd> its not a file path. its a string passed on from a controll system. the cue number 602 in this case changes as the show progresses and i am buiding a dashboard to display current state etc. 
[01:58:53] <theatre_nerd> but thanks for all your help guys. Im gonna look into splitting the sting at a fixed number of characters

[17:43:28] <getivan> Hey, is there any way I can use regex to find the first comma on each line? Here:https://regex101.com/r/bvJTPg/1  --- I just wanna use Notepadd++ to find/replace the commas with something else. I generally change these for spreadsheet imports, but then I realized that delimiting by commas would also cause the additional commas to split into columns. If Digitok is here, that'd be fabulous! :p Thanks! 
[17:52:21] <digitok> i am not here

[18:54:40] <getivan> I actually reached-out to her, when I did my prospecting, and she replied, eventually, but I was already working with a couple guys by then... probably just some creepy dude putting some chick's picture up there, but you never know... :p

[18:55:17] <Bayes> is there a compilation of "frequently used" regexes?
[18:59:21] <Me-me> Regex101.com has a library. I don't know how well-used it is.

[19:03:52] <getivan> There are sites out-there like regex-lib, but it's pretty random in terms of quality. What I do is keep a short list of the regex that I find useful for various things I do. That's probably the best way to approach it... as you get solutions, just keep a list...

[19:09:18] <Bayes> you kind of get something if you search stack overflow
