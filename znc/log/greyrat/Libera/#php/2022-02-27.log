[00:00:31] <da_wunder> that sounds thing that you _shouldn't_ do with cron
[00:01:19] <da_wunder> your first cronjob does "the thing" and in end of that cronjob you dispatch that message to queuee to process that more and then your worker handles that message
[00:01:48] <Dr-007> yeah, honestly, my original plan was to all put it in one file, hehe
[00:02:10] <da_wunder> maybe even that `FileImportCron` could use queuee - don't know your use case nor domain logic
[00:02:44] <Dr-007> but if i were to do that then i couldnt use my code on other places in laravel
[00:02:58] <da_wunder> why not?
[00:03:28] <da_wunder> you create services that makes that part - your queuee handler (worker) just uses that service
[00:03:40] <Dr-007> because i have to split it up to use it elsewhere, as laravel wants
[00:03:52] <Dr-007> right now im making my cron in `namespace App\Console\Commands;`
[00:04:08] <Dr-007> which i can test / run via `php artisan cron:FileImportCron`
[00:04:17] <da_wunder> and then you inject your processing service to that cron class...
[00:04:36] <Dr-007> but im also planning on setting up a linux inotify thing that just calls my `php artisan cron:FileImportCron`
[00:04:49] <da_wunder> that doesn't matter at all...
[00:04:53] <Dr-007> and somewhere down the line im sure im going to need to embed it inside a http request
[00:05:01] <Dr-007> oh
[00:05:02] <Dr-007> see
[00:05:08] <Dr-007> still alot of to discover
[00:05:20] <da_wunder> you just DI that processing service to that command - you can use that service where ever you inject that
[00:05:36] <da_wunder> you really should start by reading documentation first
[00:05:56] <Dr-007> true. i do that too little. i skim it
[00:06:32] <da_wunder> that is wrong way to do that - as does this conversation quite clearly points

[06:24:31] <Khepra> it's not
[06:25:16] <Khepra> I upgraded some debian servers from buster (w/ php 7.3) to bullseye (php 7.4). I wrote apparmor profiles for 7.3 and under 7.4, for same PHP code, it's logging denial on cap net_admin
[06:26:22] <Albright> Ask in a Debian channel. I don't use Debian and have no idea what you're talking about so it's probably something specific to them.
[06:26:45] <Rockwood> many channels are not active like here i think
[06:27:34] <Khepra> #debian is active, I'm a regular there
[06:28:37] <Rockwood> ah then very good
[06:29:08] <Rockwood> but you have more upgrades for PHP LTS
[06:29:19] <Rockwood> but you have to do more upgrades for PHP LTS
[06:30:07] <Khepra> also, why is php-fpm trying to write into /
[06:30:41] <__adrian> i don't know either, and have never encountered this, but what i'm searching implies it's php-fpm (not php itself) that needs net_admin
[06:31:01] <__adrian> for the tcp socket used by nginx
[06:31:10] <Khepra> oh yes, I'm sorry, I wasn't being precise. it's php-fpm that wants, both
[06:31:26] <Khepra> why would it need net_admin for the socket?
[06:31:46] <__adrian> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[06:31:52] <__adrian> just what i read on teh googles
[06:31:57] <Khepra> net_admin is a very broad brush. terribly very broad brush. pwn entire system if in wrong hands kind of terribly broad brush :)
[06:32:02] <__adrian> https://tbhaxor.com/mitigating-the-damage-in-the-compromised-webserver-using-apparmor/  about 50% down
[06:32:32] <Rockwood> __adrian, hi sir
[06:32:40] <Khepra> that person doesn't know what net_Admin does
[06:32:51] <__adrian> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[06:32:51] <Khepra> to bind to privleged port, you need net_bind_service, not net_admin
[06:33:28] <Khepra> ah well, who cares. php seems to work fine with that capability denied. case closed.
[06:34:17] <__adrian> fwiw, i'd _guess_ that the decision was made by whatever person/team packaged php-fpm for your os
[06:34:32] <__adrian> but again, no idea.
[06:34:43] <Khepra> I've looked into sources/patches on debian, there's nothing related to net_admin
[06:34:54] <Khepra> so it must be intrinsic to php-fpm

[07:42:32] <Rockwood> DB::table('users')->toSql()
[07:43:37] <Dr-007> nah its not working, ive got: $file->save()->toSql();
[07:43:41] <Dr-007> ive made a model
[07:44:01] <Rockwood> you are using eloquent
[07:44:06] <Dr-007> yes
[07:44:37] <Rockwood> you can use --> DB::enableQueryLog(); query here dd(DB::getQueryLog());
[07:44:41] <Rockwood> try this please
[07:45:57] <Dr-007> now ive got:
[07:45:58] <Dr-007>             $file->save();

[17:01:56] <ron1w> Hi there my friends , can i make a little question
[17:02:17] <ron1w> hi have this simple code
[17:02:44] <ron1w> <a href='mailto:<?php echo $mail;?>?subject=<?php echo $subject;?>&body=<?php echo "$message";?>'>Send Mail</a>
[17:03:54] <ron1w> $message is somethin like "Hi , my name is Ron1w" , but when i clic on send mail , the body only insert "Hi" , what i m doing wrong ?
[17:07:46] <AllenJB> ron1w: Does the message contain line returns?
[17:10:11] <AllenJB> Frankly I would consider using mailto links unreliable if you want to include a message. They rely on the web browser being correctly set up to call the mail client, and the mail client correctly interpreting the message.

[17:11:34] <AllenJB> When you want to include a message, I would use a form-based system (and a library such as PHPMailer of Symfony Mailer to send the mail from your server, using a From address you control to avoid issues with anti-spam measures)

[17:16:35] <ron1w> Yes, i m working with phpmailer right now , but i need to make this to edit message after send
[17:17:20] <da_wunder> "edit message after send" ? what is the use case for that?
[17:18:08] <ron1w> XD sorry , my english , the word is "before"
[17:18:44] <da_wunder> so create a form where use can change that message, and then when he/she submit that form you send that email
