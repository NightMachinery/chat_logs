[15:19:27] <flatcap> morning all
[15:23:03] <gahr> hi flatcap 
[15:25:34] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[15:27:08] <flatcap> I found the cause the of limit problems a703b4c1e ;-)
[15:29:44] *** Joins: nyah (~nyah@05453449.skybroadband.com)
[15:36:56] <gahr> ah yeah I saw that yesterday evening
[15:37:01] <gahr> thanks!
[15:38:27] <gahr> that's basically a revert of https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/commit/a703b4c1e3ff8109d2568c2b9b1b4fc6b67ae2e3
[15:38:33] <gahr> so I'm thinking what I was thinking...
[15:39:07] <flatcap> np
[15:39:08] <gahr> so probably the only thing that's needed from my fix is priv->menu->max = shared->mailbox->vcount;
[15:39:19] <flatcap> yes, that was a fix we needed
[15:41:04] <flatcap> how are your patterns coming along?
[15:45:19] <gahr> coverage is giving me weird results
[15:45:52] <flatcap> oh?
[15:46:08] <flatcap> the results should be cumulative of any tests that get run
[15:46:31] <gahr> I get like 0 for eat_regex
[15:48:37] <flatcap> I see _some_ coverage of eat_regex()
[15:50:52] <gahr> btw, I switched to gcc11 to test, and I see https://gist.github.com/gahr/3f92952b3e0895aef929319956014826
[15:50:59] <gahr> seen that before?
[15:52:01] <flatcap> my coverage of your latest push: https://flatcap.org/mutt/lcov2/pattern/index.html
[15:52:15] * flatcap looks ...
[15:52:49] <flatcap> oh yeah, there are a handful of those "helpful" compiler warnings
[15:53:48] <flatcap> I think there's an option to quieten them
[15:55:22] <gahr> format-truncation=
[15:55:23] <gahr> yeah
[15:56:12] <flatcap> I think we've tried to eliminate some of them, before
[16:05:21] <gahr> I'm running only neomutt-test -E pattern
[16:05:30] <gahr> but I get this https://people.freebsd.org/~gahr/coverage/pattern/index.html
[16:07:09] <gahr> anyway, I'm reasonably confident with my changes :)
[16:12:32] *** Quits: bitigchi2 (~bitigchi@user/bitigchi) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[16:13:48] <flatcap> that's weird
[16:14:02] <gahr> that i'm confident with my changes?
[16:14:03] <gahr> yeah.. a bit
[16:14:04] <gahr> :D
[16:14:27] <gahr> so with the fix selection limit, if it can't find the current email, it'll select the last one
[16:14:41] <gahr> should it perhaps keep the current "line" in the index?
[16:14:50] <gahr> if there is one?
[16:15:29] <flatcap> yeah, I wondered about that
[16:15:53] <gahr> I think I'd add a menu_set_index(priv->menu, 0); before the loop
[16:15:57] <gahr> then keep the loop as it is
[16:16:54] <flatcap> and I thought of the "perfect" solution of: work backwards from the invisible one to find the first that _would_ be visible after the limit is applied
[16:17:37] <flatcap> that is probably overkill :-)
[16:17:46] <gahr> yeah
[16:18:05] <gahr> so depending on your current selection, jumping to the first or to the last could be equally disturbing
[16:18:18] <gahr> selection + sorting
[16:18:58] <flatcap> yeah
[16:19:14] *** Quits: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[16:19:17] <flatcap> I'll have another look in a sec
[16:19:35] <flatcap> btw, did you mean `-E` for the tests?
[16:19:59] <flatcap> according to the help: -E, --no-exec         Same as --exec=never
[16:20:18] <flatcap> I think you told it to run all the tests that *don't* match "pattern"
[16:21:16] <flatcap> no, ignore me.  that's child processes
[16:22:07] <gahr> ah yeah, I just always -E so it's easier to gdb
[16:22:32] <flatcap> ah, makes sense
[16:22:47] <gahr> forget about coverage, I have a weird setup
[16:23:37] <gahr> so about 3296
[16:23:59] <gahr> we could also keep the current offset from the top if it matches a message
[16:25:15] <gahr> lunch, bbl
[16:25:29] <flatcap> ok, I'll keep thinking

[18:32:07] <flatcap> yes-ish
[18:32:36] <flatcap> I pushd some WIP to [devel/limit2]
[18:32:55] <flatcap> I tried looking for the previous visible
[18:33:22] <flatcap> I initially thought that'd be hard, because I thought that limiting sorted the invisible ones to the end
[18:33:32] <flatcap> but it doesn't for the index.  I'm not sure what I was thinking of
[18:33:45] <flatcap> limit2, sort of works
[18:34:13] <flatcap> selection on a visible item: selection stays on item
[18:34:23] <flatcap> selection before visible: sel -> 0
[18:34:30] <flatcap> sel after visible: sel to end
[18:34:59] <flatcap> sel between blocks of visible: sel to previous visible entry
[18:35:07] <flatcap> but not quite
[18:35:22] <flatcap> when removing a limit things got a bit weird
[18:36:56] <flatcap> I spent an hour on it, but that's all I can spare for now -- I'm trying to focus on my menu_loop() refactoring
[18:37:07] <gahr> sure 
[18:37:43] <gahr> I think I'd avoid a double loop over all emails, if possible
[18:38:03] <flatcap> yeah
[18:39:04] <gahr> I think I'd select the first email
[18:39:11] <gahr> like we do when we enter a mailbox afresh
[18:39:57] <flatcap> yeah, that's a non-confusing behaviour
