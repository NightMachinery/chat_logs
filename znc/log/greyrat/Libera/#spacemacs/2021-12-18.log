[15:22:49] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @GuessWhatBBQ You mean 'enable' for all buffers?
[15:24:11] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> You can get more info from the docstring of the `word-wrap` variable
[15:25:51] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Finally, maybe `M-x customize-variable` `global-visual-line-mode` would be helpful for you

[18:18:54] <FromGitter> <Rimann91> Trying to learn how to debug problems in spacemacs. My line numbers have suddenly stopped turning on even though that instruction is still the same in .spacemacs
[18:20:10] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @Rimann91 What is the instruction?
[18:20:52] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> You mean the value of `dotspacemacs-line-numbers`?
[18:27:59] <FromGitter> <Rimann91> thats the one, I have it set to relative
[18:28:24] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> So that is broken?
[18:28:34] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> somehow?
[18:30:04] <FromGitter> <Rimann91> yes

[18:31:51] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> This is new to me
[18:31:59] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> It is js code
[18:32:15] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> or... more xml
[18:32:32] <FromGitter> <Rimann91> sorry, havent used a gist in a while. Hold on
[18:32:59] <FromGitter> <Rimann91> https://gist.github.com/Rimann91/22ca09665ef2c9523159b338df5b574f
[18:33:18] <FromGitter> <Rimann91> try that one
[18:33:42] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Yes it works... I have never used a gist before... also that is new to me
[18:33:57] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> So now what part is not working?
[18:34:19] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Ah... the line numbers don't turn on anywhere
[18:34:27] <FromGitter> <Rimann91> when I open any file, no line numbers appear. They were working the day before yesterday
[18:34:29] <FromGitter> <Rimann91> correct
[18:35:06] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Okay so I guess Spacemacs controls some Emacs line-number variable
[18:36:12] <FromGitter> <Rimann91> ok
[18:36:25] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> So is `display-line-numbers-mode` t or nil?
[18:37:19] <FromGitter> <Rimann91> must be set to nil because I just turned it on
[18:37:33] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> And now the line numbers show?
[18:38:17] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Actually I menat `line-number-mode`
[18:38:34] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Ah no... display line number mode
[18:38:48] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> It is a little confusing... two similarly named modes
[18:39:31] <FromGitter> <Rimann91> where would they be set? they do not appear in .spacemacs
[18:39:35] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Ah okay `line-number-mode` displays the line number in the modeline
[18:40:15] <FromGitter> <Rimann91> M-x display-line-number-mode turned on line numbers.... but did not set my `relative` line number configuration
[18:40:33] <FromGitter> <Rimann91> which will work ok for now, but i'd like to have relative line numbers turned back on
[18:40:35] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Well I guess that mode is controlled via the `dotspacemacs-line-numbers` variable
[18:42:08] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> So I guess, because of the value of `dotspacemacs-line-numbers` that the line-number should get 'switched on',  but that probably after that, something switches it off again
[18:43:28] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> if you set the value of `dotspacemacs-line-numbers` simply to t, then does it work?
[18:45:48] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> you could try adding `(debug-on-variable-change 'display-line-numbers-mode)` at the beginning of your dotspacemacs `user-config`, see if it triggers the debugger
[18:46:26] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> After restarting Spacemacs and visiting some buffer
[18:48:36] <FromGitter> <Rimann91> Ok cool, thank you for your help. I have to leave but I will try that advice later
[18:48:49] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Okay... good luck
[18:53:46] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @Rimann91 Btw if you read this later... you can also paste code directly here wrapped in triple backticks (you can use shift+enter to add new lines when typing messages)
[18:58:29] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> You could also try to debug the `display-line-numbers` variable in a similar way
