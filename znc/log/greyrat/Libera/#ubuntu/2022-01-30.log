[00:45:40] <Anf> Hello to all. I am currently setting up a new backup on a new HDD and have always used borg backup before. But now I've heard about Restic and have taken a closer look at the tool. Can't decide between the two now? Are there advantages and disadvantages? I only use Linux and I don't need any compression.

[00:49:16] <matsaman> and if you don't need incremental backups, then rsync is already enough

[01:00:01] <matsaman> I don't really want encryption in a backup tool, either. I can do that separately

[01:01:39] <matsaman> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20147298
[01:02:31] <matsaman> doesn't seem like they're tremendously different
[01:02:45] <matsaman> restic is in Go?
[01:02:56] <matsaman> so honestly I might think borg, in python, will last longer
[01:03:06] <Anf> Yes, restic is in Go and borg in Phython

[06:03:59] <rdr> goddard: that's the default gnome behavior
[06:04:01] <rdr> ubuntu changes it
[06:04:18] <rdr> you might have to install "gnome-session", log out and then choose "GNOME" either the default wayland or x11
[06:05:12] <leftyfb> goddard: I use dash to dock which does that for me
[06:05:31] <rdr> you can also type alt+`
[06:05:32] <leftyfb> goddard: oh, not for windows though, only the icons on the dock
[06:06:51] <ogra> and i'D be surprised if gnomes default bhaviour would be to convince apps to have evry instance in tabs
[06:07:08] <leftyfb> not all apps are going to support that regardless
[06:07:08] <rdr> oh i misunderstood
[06:07:16] <rdr> i thought they meant while doing alt+tab

[06:10:49] <goddard> yeah windows has that feature with an application called "Groupy" from StarDock
[06:10:55] <goddard> and MacOS has that feature out of the box
[06:11:14] <goddard> You can make applications of the same type just be a tab
[06:11:17] <goddard> super handy
[06:12:05] <axsuul> My Ubuntu 20.04 has been running for about 2 weeks, no issues. Then all of sudden today it stopped responding. I KVM'd in and there was the error "[1594642.9898761 NMI: PCI system error (SERR) for reason b0 on CPU O.". I have tried googling this but getting mixed answers. Is this pointing to a hardware issue?
