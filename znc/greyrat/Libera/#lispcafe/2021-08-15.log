[14:18:36] <hayley> I remember a tale about how Unix utilities before GNU were more unreliable and prone to crash than after. Anyone remember anything like that?
[14:21:42] <hayley> Perhaps https://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/par-distr-sys/technical_papers/fuzz.pdf and https://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/pub/paradyn/technical_papers/fuzz-revisited.ps are of relevance; the latter tests GNU/Linux systems and finds them much better.

[14:35:57] <pjb> hayley: well, unix utilities were probably more dispersed before GNU. Each unix provided had to write or patch its own, and only its customers would test them.  With GNU everybody use and test them, and can also debug them since the sources are available and you're free to correct them.
[14:36:20] <hayley> pjb: Yes, I am aware of how free software works.

[14:36:28] <pjb> There remains basically only two versions of unix utilities: GNU and BSD…
[14:37:22] <hayley> I am mentally preparing for one of many hard arguments I'll have to put to paper. Even if GNU isn't used that much directly by the average consumer, it sure as hell set some standards that proprietary vendors had to meet, else they would look bad.
[14:38:13] <pjb> I don't know.  The only remaning unix vendor that I know of is Apple, and the fight hard to avoid their users using the unix layer…
[14:38:33] <pjb> Perhaps it was true at some time during the transition.  What unix vendor remains nowadays?
[14:40:07] <hayley> At the least, it speaks volumes on giving people source code, and on having users be able to debug and patch well enough, or at least spot the cause of the crash. So I figure we just make that easier.
[14:40:52] <pjb> Yes. And the unix layer under macOS is open source too (BSD). https://opensource.apple.com
