[03:07:20] <Matt|home> quick question. trying to do some grammar wizardry in another language. in english we do have infinitives yeah? "to read, to write" etc
[03:07:49] <Matt|home> is there a specific name for adding -ing- to the end of a verb , reading, writing etc? what's the difference between "reading" and "to read", is it subtle or are they the same
[03:09:42] <hoglahoo> I think verbs with -ing added are considered present participles
[03:09:52] <hoglahoo> does that answer any part of what you’re asking?
[03:10:08] <Matt|home> google-sensei says "read" is simple present and "reading" is present continuous, so does that imply that "reading" is a currently ongoing activity ?
[03:12:25] <hoglahoo> I am agreeing with that

[14:45:16] <Voxel> What do you think?
[14:45:31] <Voxel> Should it be "only A unique"

[14:46:12] <huf> a.
[14:46:37] <Voxel> I'm sorry?
[14:47:29] <MetaNova> Voxel: a unique and permanent ID

[14:48:14] <Voxel> Interesting...
[14:48:32] <Voxel> "A unique and permanent ID card and A phone number"?
[14:49:01] <MetaNova> yes, "and a phone number"
[14:49:40] <Voxel> Holy smokes...
[14:49:43] <Voxel> These articles...
[14:49:46] <MetaNova> without the 'a' in "a phone number" it makes it sound like "a unique and permanent ID card and phone number" to be a single thing
[14:49:59] <Voxel> Yeah, makes sense
[14:50:01] <MetaNova> conversationally you could probably get away without the second 'a'
[14:50:19] <MetaNova> I've heard that construction many times
[14:50:40] <MetaNova> eg, "You will need a valid mailing address and phone number to subscribe" (for example)
[14:51:12] <Voxel> I see. Like a single thing with two objects inside.
[14:51:21] <MetaNova> yes, quite right
[14:51:36] <MetaNova> so I believe the second 'a' is more correct
[14:51:46] <MetaNova> even though you can often hear it omitted
[14:53:15] <Voxel> "...a request requires only: unique and permanent ID card; phone number."
[14:53:51] <Voxel> Such construction should also work, right>
[14:53:53] <Voxel> ?*
[14:54:38] <MetaNova> I don't object to that construction
[14:54:57] <MetaNova> it doesn't feel as natural to me but I don't think it's wrong

[23:21:11] <Voxel> Hey all ^^
[23:21:25] <Voxel> What do you think about: "Being together with a Family is one of the best ways to..."
[23:21:48] <huf> just any family?
[23:21:52] <blkshp> So you are with another fam...
[23:21:55] <huf> seems a bit creepy
[23:22:03] <Voxel> XD
[23:22:22] <blkshp> if it's your family just "family" not "a family"
[23:22:40] <Voxel> I'm trying to cheer a person who wrote that they are going to be with a family when their family member got a terminal cancer
[23:23:03] <huf> a terminal cancer?
[23:23:16] <hoglahoo> you could always use the tried and true “what you said is one of the best ways to...”
[23:23:20] <huf> (also, "got"?)
[23:23:29] <Voxel> Got - Found
[23:23:34] <huf> FOUND?!
[23:23:38] <blkshp> huf: I'd consider "got" acceptable.
[23:23:38] <Voxel> ?
[23:23:46] <huf> blkshp: barely, but okay
[23:23:53] <huf> you get diagnosed with it
[23:23:55] <blkshp> Barely, yes, but yes.
[23:23:58] <Voxel> huf found by a medic?
[23:24:03] <huf> you already have it by that time
[23:24:19] <blkshp> It's not like "got a cold" but is accepted as such (probably not in the profesion)
[23:24:24] <blkshp> profession*
[23:24:35] <huf> yeah it's less weird than "a terminal cancer"
[23:24:39] <huf> though there are many kinds of cancer
[23:24:46] <huf> we still dont say that, I dont think
[23:24:48] <Voxel> There are curable cancers
[23:24:50] <blkshp> yeah, you can't say "a terminal"
[23:24:55] <Voxel> Terminal means incurable.
[23:24:57] <hoglahoo> Vocel isn’t asking about a terminal cancer
[23:24:57] <StayHungry> huf: terminal cancer is the final (forth) stage of cancer
[23:25:01] <hoglahoo> Voxel*
[23:25:15] <StayHungry> *fourth
[23:25:20] <blkshp> True, but I lost what they were asking, Voxel, sorry, again?
[23:25:54] <blkshp> I'd say if it was a native English speaker it was just an error.
[23:26:00] <Voxel> "Being together with family is one of the best ways to a family member"
[23:26:01] <hoglahoo> family versus a family?
[23:26:06] <Voxel> to help*
[23:26:53] <Voxel> The "Being" part is quite weird, no?
[23:26:59] <blkshp> no, the rest is 
[23:27:07] <Voxel> Why?
[23:27:21] <Voxel> They said that they are going to be with their family for a while
[23:27:24] <blkshp> I'm not sure what it's trying to say
[23:27:27] <TechTest> why can't you say "a terminal"?
[23:27:36] <blkshp> I'm going ot see my family to help them through/
[23:27:39] <Voxel> Because we're a programmers
[23:27:47] <blkshp> ba-dum-tsss
[23:27:53] <Voxel> XD
[23:27:59] <TechTest> you can have more than one terminal
[23:28:09] <huf> for trains, yes
[23:28:18] <huf> or airplanes
[23:28:21] <TechTest> for computers too
[23:28:32] <huf> oh those
[23:28:39] <huf> we no longer use those things 
[23:28:46] <TechTest> what?
[23:28:49] <Voxel> blkshp, I'm trying to tell them that their choice to be with a family is one of the best.
[23:28:50] <blkshp> If you have 2 terminal cancers you still have terminal cancer.
[23:28:57] <StayHungry> one of the best ways to support the dying is to surround them with family care
[23:28:58] <Voxel> *with their family*
[23:29:30] <huf> you could say two terminal cancers in the sort of way you say very dead.
[23:29:32] <Voxel> Thank you, StayHungr, but... I'm trying to not say such words like "dying"
[23:29:53] <Voxel> StayHungry*
[23:30:03] <blkshp> You need to be with your family right now.
[23:30:05] <TechTest> oh that terminal
[23:30:22] <TechTest> did I got too nerdy?
[23:30:28] <TechTest> *get
[23:30:32] <Voxel> Not really.
[23:31:03] <Voxel> That's why used "terminal cancer" instead of "terminal"
