[00:00:23] <blackop> twb: hmm
[00:02:40] <twb> cousteau: yes
[00:03:04] <twb> But since we've been talking about radar, all I can think of is "ground clutter"!
[00:03:16] <cousteau> that's good, what is it?
[00:03:25] <twb> That's a radar thing
[00:04:20] <twb> When you're an american military pilot trying to blow up a school or hospital, all the trees and shit sticking out of the ground are described as "ground clutter"
[00:04:54] <twb> There's a knob on the radar to discard "boring" stuff below some threshold, that you have to adjust reguarly

[12:14:19] <kurahaupo> samuely: you can connect to an entirely different set of servers which have taken over the name "chat.freenode.net"
[12:14:57] <kurahaupo> samuely: They have no record of any accounts which used to exist on the old server, except where a few people have gone to the trouble of re-registering the same account name, twice.
[12:15:37] <samuely> but the domain owner is not changed.
[12:16:15] <samuely> so the servers could be the same as the old ones
[12:17:24] <kurahaupo> samuely: No. For a while it was possible to connect to both. The previous servers were not owned by the organization that ran freenode, they were contributed by donors, every one of whom refuses to deal with the "new freenode"
[12:18:07] <kurahaupo> The owner of the domain hasn't changed; the owner of the owner of the domain has.

[12:24:24] <samuely> it's unconvinient to us users
[12:24:33] <kurahaupo> samuely: The first problem is that it has an "owner" at all. The intention was that it would be operated by a trust, not owned by shareholders.
[12:24:52] <kurahaupo> s/unconvinient/inconvenient
[12:24:53] <chat> kurahaupo thinks samuely meant to say: it's inconvenient to us users
[12:26:25] <kurahaupo> The second problem is that Andrew Lee aka @rasengan wanted to meddle in the operations, to try to make money from the operation, when EVERYTHING was actually contributed by volunteers. He asserted this right on the basis of having paid for something else (a conference).
[12:27:28] <kurahaupo> samuely: Please read the various pages about it; the subject has been beaten to death here.
[12:28:50] <samuely> so he failed?
[12:29:09] <samuely> is he chinese?
[12:29:42] <kurahaupo> samuely: Everybody left. The people on "freenode" now are mostly people who were kicked off the old freenode for being disruptive there.
[12:29:57] <kurahaupo> I have no idea what nationality Lee is; it doesn't seem relevant
[12:30:18] <samuely> I understand it now. it's a story of some 'evil' guy wants money, and failed.
[12:30:35] <samuely> Lee should be a chinese surname.
[12:30:39] <samuely> am i right
[12:30:44] <kurahaupo> again, how is that relevant?
[12:31:14] <samuely> only just in terms of english Language
[12:31:31] <samuely> kind of etymology
[12:32:10] <kurahaupo> Yes, it probably was originally a name from China.
[12:33:54] <samuely> so this is the real freenode, renamed 
[12:34:16] <samuely> with the real people, servers. only a changed name
[12:35:28] <samuely> how many servers Lee has? if every donors refuse, 'freenode' will eventually die
[12:35:44] <samuely> in years
[12:35:45] <twb> samuely: you can connect to a thing that calls itself "freenode", but it's not freenode
[12:36:41] <samuely> i've connected there, but people just don't talk, odd. someone kindly guided me here.
[12:38:44] <kurahaupo> samuely: More "reborn" than "the same". It has the same "soul", but much has changed as well, not just the name.

[19:26:04] <Rashad> Trying to find the translatation to a term we use to English: We use the term سَوق to refer to the process of delivering paper documents from one office to another or to the headquarters.
[19:26:31] <Rashad> This largely is a formality now as e-documents became the dominant form of processing.
[19:27:15] <Rashad> However I need to write that term in my code so it needs to be in English and I am not so keen on using a transliteration instead.
[19:27:52] <Rashad> Currently thinking of "delivery" but ideally I want to find some already existing term for such a thing.
[19:28:51] <TimMc> Rashad: Is this inter-office mail?
[19:29:19] <Rashad> TimMc Actually it is of official documents for purposes of archiving.
[19:29:28] <Rashad> ...or that's what I gather anyway.
[19:30:08] <Rashad> Because we are a government organization, such documents can sometimes be required by law to be archived for a minimum period of time in case they become needed say in a trial, etc.
[19:32:09] <Rashad> Even though we have electronic copies of such documents most of the time, the law seems to still rely on the physical version for some reason. I think some documents that are not issued by us like invoices, etc, that the public presents are not considered valid in a court of law in electronic form, even as a scanned attachment, but I don't know for
[19:32:10] <Rashad> sure.
[19:37:31] <TimMc> Hmm, I can't think of a term for that.
[19:45:40] <TimMc> A related term is "retention", but that doesn't seem quite right for what you want.
