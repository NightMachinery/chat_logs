[05:58:42] <Zipheir> That might be an interesting flavor of reflection to explore.

[06:05:30] <jcowan> dpk: great, congrats!
[06:06:00] <Spawns> what exactly is the environment in scheme? is that all of the globals bindings?
[06:06:06] <Spawns> or is it any binding at all
[06:07:01] <Spawns> oh i see that first class environments are known to be tricky to support when compiling your scheme
[06:07:06] <Spawns> thats good to know
[06:10:52] <Zipheir> Spawns: "the" environment might indeed be the set of all global bindings at some point in a program's evaluation.
[06:12:52] <Zipheir> Spawns: In the semantics of the standard, "an" environment is a mapping from identifier to store locations, and there are many of them (usually created by lambda abstraction).
[06:13:57] <Zipheir> And extended by application.
[06:13:59] <Spawns> that's what I was thinking. My bytecode only knows of bindings by their offset into an array instead of by name which would be a string
[06:14:24] <Spawns> i figured converting all local var lookups into a simple index into an array would be a lot faster
[06:15:15] <jcowan> Pretty much, yes.
[06:15:34] <jcowan> Scheme also supports multiple global environments, but with limitationos
[06:17:14] <Zipheir> jcowan: wb!

[06:24:07] <Spawns> s-liao: well that's the way crafting interpreters is doing it and I am trying to follow along, but I figured it would be much faster than looking it up in a hashmap each time as well
[06:24:37] <Spawns> crafting interpreters is a book/guide thing that teaches how to create interpreters from the ground up
[06:25:32] <Spawns> i've actually rewrote the compiler a few times now, right now its all WIP and doesn't even work

[06:26:33] <Zipheir> It's pretty extensive.
[06:26:59] <Spawns> no I didn't but that looks great! I've been looking for something more geared towards scheme specifically 
[06:27:02] <Spawns> thanks
[06:27:06] <Zipheir> yw
[06:27:14] <Zipheir> Hah, first comment is Matt Might.
[06:27:26] <Spawns> who is that?
[06:27:35] <Zipheir> Promoting his now-debunked derivative parsing technique, I see.
[06:28:01] <Zipheir> He's a Schemer and Scalarian(?) who's written some good posts on the workings of Scheme.
[06:28:30] <Zipheir> This is a very interesting one. https://matt.might.net/articles/compiling-scheme-to-c/
[06:29:08] <Zipheir> Easy to understand, and it emits working C.  No GC or tail-call optimization, but it's a start.
[06:33:37] <Spawns> it looks like the bytecode version of it was never finished
[06:34:00] <Spawns> for the scheme from scratch one
[06:34:13] <jcowan> Zipheir: What's wrong with parsing with Brozowski derivatives?  The XML schema language Relax NG depends on them.
[06:34:27] <jcowan> Pointer to the debunking?
[06:36:41] <Zipheir> Interesting.  I was referring specifically to the algorithm Might was using, which was hit hard by Russ Cox https://research.swtch.com/yaccalive
[06:37:42] <Zipheir> I don't think it applies to parsing with derivatives *in general*.  Might said his algorithm was O(n²) "but not too bad in practice"; later attempts at implementation should it *was* rather bad in practice, I believ.
[06:37:47] <Zipheir> *believe
[06:38:59] <Zipheir> The nutshell version of Cox's rebuttal is that Might reinvented the old, pre-Thompson inefficient regex matching algorithm.

[13:01:06] <wasamasa> zomg, the gambit homepage is back
[13:01:15] <wasamasa> how fucking long has it been?
[13:01:53] <wasamasa> archive.org isn't really helpful here, last capture has been from 2017
[13:01:59] <wasamasa> it couldn't have been that long, right
[13:02:05] <wasamasa> or could it?
[13:03:41] <wasamasa> anyway, they've done a redesign and it seems they're partially pointing at a staging subdomain
[13:03:42] <wasamasa> whatever
[13:04:30] <wasamasa> the online documentation is still as weird to use as it ever was
[13:04:37] <wasamasa> > The Gambit wiki is being phased out, but is still available in read-only mode.
[13:04:41] <wasamasa> sigh
[13:05:35] <wasamasa> but hey, they didn't break the old links
[13:05:41] <wasamasa> props to that
[13:05:42] <s-liao> http://www.gambitscheme.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page that is what I found out
[13:10:28] <dpk> conspicuously lacking on the new Gambit home page: any link to 'documentation'
[13:11:13] <dpk> the first point in each of the three columns on the home page looks like a link, but isn't

[13:13:30] <wasamasa> I asked myself the same about forensics, clearly they have another definition than me

[21:17:31] <Franciman> i don't understand how you can be so in favour of copyright, when it's mostly used to oppress people on behalf of powerful ones
[21:17:42] <Franciman> i mean as a strategy, not in particular cases
[21:17:47] <Franciman> artists deserve to be protected
[21:20:29] <tokie> i used to GPL everything i did opensource, and not i MIT/APACHE it because i really want my stuff to be free to whoever wants to learn from it. commercial, educational, recreational, whatever
[21:22:30] <Zipheir> Haha.  I think it's entirely consistent to oppose the GPL on grounds that it's an *overreach* of copyright.  I don't necessarily take or endorse that view.
[21:24:48] <Zipheir> In any case, GPL'd libraries have created licensing messes for FOSS in the past due to incompatibility.
[21:25:19] <Zipheir> But, yes, this is an endless topic.
[21:31:29] <Zipheir> I agree with a lot of the FSF's goals, but I can't stomach that "those who aren't with us are against us" stance.
[21:31:30] <mdhughes> My policy is BSD license when I want to share code, commercial when I want to sell it. FSF is tyranny, just Stallman's instead of Microsoft's.
[21:31:39] <amazigh> +1 Zipheir on FSF
[21:31:51] <amazigh> +1 mdhughes 
[21:32:12] <amazigh> not-GPL is not necessarly pro-copyright, or I do not understand that phrase.
[21:32:29] <Franciman> so you prefer allowing apple to take your code and enslave underage workers to have hardware on which to deploy your code
[21:32:31] <amazigh> Also, FSF / GNU claims they are the only ones that care about ethics.
[21:32:53] <amazigh> GPL is not the only way, and neither the FSF.
[21:33:00] <Zipheir> Exactly.
[21:33:03] <Franciman> glad to know other ways
[21:33:06] <Franciman> and no, BSD is not one
[21:33:18] <mdhughes> I'm pro-limited copyright. There's a lot of public rights to workss that get stomped on by corporate interests. But copyright also protects individual artists. It just shouldn't last more than 20-40 years.

[21:37:38] <Zipheir> GPLv2 has been found enforceable many times.  Not sure about GPLv3.
[21:37:41] <mdhughes> (and MIT, X11, etc. are equivalent to BSD, just as good for practical work)
[21:37:59] <Franciman> it doesn't enforce everybody to give their changes to the community
[21:38:03] <Franciman> when distributing
[21:38:09] <mdhughes> Not everyone wants to do that!
[21:38:19] <Franciman> i am answering to: BSD does everything GPL does
[21:38:25] <amazigh> mdhughes: that's a mistake in the grand scheme of things.
[21:38:32] <nomagno> Franciman: That ethical license list physically hurt to read
[21:38:40] <nomagno> Only was missing the anticapitalist license
[21:38:52] <gwatt> "grand scheme" would be a decent name for a scheme implementation
[21:38:59] <mdhughes> No, if you make locally useful changes, or stuff that's specific to your business, there's no reason to be releasing that.
[21:39:00] <Franciman> lol true
[21:39:26] <nomagno> ... Seriously, do some people really fix all ethical issues with constricting legislation?
[21:39:35] <mdhughes> If you want to share back, you still can with BSD. It's just not coercive.
[21:39:37] <amazigh> constricting?
[21:39:54] <nomagno> amazigh: Restrictive, whatever
[21:39:54] <dpk> Franciman: most of the OS part of Mac OS is open source, by the way (Darwin)
[21:40:09] <Franciman> yes 
[21:40:21] <dpk> and used to include major GPL components, but Apple declared themselves allergic to GPLv3, iirc
[21:40:27] <gwatt> also, question about r7rs parameterize: Has anyone written code that relies on the restoration behavior not calling the optional converter/validator function?

[21:41:02] <mdhughes> gambit> PASSED ALL 285 UNIT TESTS
[21:41:12] <nomagno> A license that imposes a legal requirement not to do harm is self-defeating, because the legal requirement not to do harm is already a legal requirement already, and codifying it has a real chance of making the license invalid

[21:42:08] <amazigh> nomagno: usual claim against ethical license, that is wrong.
[21:42:13] <mdhughes> Can't make docs, don't have ghostscript, and that's like an hour of grinding for macports.

[21:42:38] <Franciman> so contemporary
[21:42:40] <Franciman> xd
[21:42:48] <Franciman> you force people to do their vaccine
[21:43:10] <Zipheir> Regardless of the (dubious) enforceability of "ethical licenses", there is a legitimate question of whether using IP laws to try to enforce behavior you like is a good approach.
[21:43:11] <amazigh> It is not because you have 18+ that you know everything that is good for you, us, and so forth
[21:43:52] <amazigh> please say you do not care for us, and so forth, and only care about yourself, that will be easier to understand.
[21:44:00] <nomagno> Making weapons with my code is a perfectly valid use for software, just attribute me properly and hope I don't rightfully break your legs tonight
[21:44:00] <Franciman> i liked the idea of having a community and making sure every change were beneficial to the whole community. Maybe I am too naive
[21:44:25] <amazigh> Franciman: I did too.
[21:44:55] <nomagno> Franciman: Well that's not naive, codifying that into a license is just self-defeating
[21:45:18] <mdhughes> If someone can make weapons with my games, I'm very impressed. I wouldn't do that, or encourage it, but I don't think a license is the solution.
[21:45:27] <amazigh> There is many other communities, that do not boast a self-proclaimed religious-like dictator
[21:46:28] <amazigh> I hope the management will change one day at fsf
[21:47:04] <mdhughes> gambit doesn't like me redefining top-level define in gsi.
[21:47:20] <Zipheir> OK, having seen a wide range of opinions on the topic, let's get back to Scheming, please.
[21:47:29] <dpk> Gambit doesn't have hygienic macros out of the box, does it?
[21:47:39] <mdhughes> And "*** EOF again to exit" might be my least favorite thing an interpreter does.
[21:47:46] <dpk> you have to point it at psyntax or something
[21:48:26] <mdhughes> define-macro & define-syntax only.
[21:49:37] <Franciman> dpk: i think it does 
[21:49:47] <Franciman> ah no, i am getting confused with gerbil, sorry
[21:50:48] <nomagno> I am actually fairly compromised because my views align almost completely with those of the FSF (although I am not as enthusiastic about copyleft), but I absolutely despise it as an organization
[21:50:54] <nomagno> Too pedantic

[21:51:53] <Franciman> laywers must be pedantic
[21:51:55] <Franciman> :P
[21:52:15] <mdhughes> I grew up before the FSF, back when copyright in software was infrequently defined or enforced. Most stuff in books & magazines was "public domain" or just "do what thou wilt".
[21:53:32] <nomagno> I definitely think it is very legitimate activism, but their structure and generally policy is just completely backwards, and keeps getting more backwards
[21:53:54] <mdhughes> And that model works for getting programmers to share their code. No lawyers involved, wanted, or not driven out at pitchfork-point.
[21:54:07] <tokie> well, there's definitely a shift in the opensource world to not use FSF licenses. so not sure how much it matters anymore
[21:56:55] <mdhughes> Oh, I hadn't checked and had a bad moment of worry, but it installed in /usr/local/Gambit like a good boy.
[21:57:30] <mdhughes> Which of the 5 different install roots is it going to use and fuck something up? Nope, it made a sane choice.
[21:58:52] <nomagno> tokie: GNU's still an unimaginably massive project, specially glibc, GCC, binutils, and moreutils
[21:58:54] <gwatt> I occasionally follow Rob Landley's blog. He was involved in busybox development and actually participated in lawsuits to have companies show their modifications to busybox as it's GPL. The whole experience discouraged him from ever using GPL again and he created the Zero-Clause BSD license
[21:59:26] <tokie> nomagno: yes, but a lot of that stuff is seeing replacement slowly but surely and in a lot of cases it's by ecosystems that have MIT/APACHE as a standard
[21:59:55] <nomagno> The apache license is used way too often by how sucky it is
[22:00:18] <tokie> the entire rust ecosystem is usually MIT/APACHE dual 
[22:00:24] <tokie> or often just MIT
[22:00:36] <Zipheir> gwatt: I didn't know that.  I knew the busybox guys were very active in GPL enforcement.
[22:00:40] <nomagno> Its self-termination policy for patents is incredibly dumb, and the "you must mark modifications" clause is incovenient
[22:00:51] <mdhughes> Yeah, I note that Gambit is dual-license Apache or LGPL. Thanks, that's… tolerable and slightly less tolerable, but neither good.
[22:01:04] <nomagno> I definity push for MIT over apache2, never exclusive apache2 for sure
[22:01:07] <gwatt> Zipheir: he let busybox and started toybox, which is shipped in android now.
[22:01:29] <tokie> nomagno: yeah, i think it's usually MIT or MIT/APACHE
[22:01:49] <amazigh> busybox is used in alpine
[22:03:07] <nomagno> There's a project... Oh yeah, fricking WASM of all things. It has apache2 for the code and w3c for the spec
[22:03:11] <nomagno> Think about it for a second
[22:03:31] <amazigh> ?
[22:03:33] <nomagno> It has a license with patent clause for the code, and a license without patent clause for the document
[22:04:06] <nomagno> As in, you can't safely implement the spec without risking patent lawsuit
[22:04:17] <nomagno> But you can safely ... ? Code isn't patentable
[22:04:27] <nomagno> But it has a patent license anyways

[23:10:12] <wasamasa> are you going to prey on registering foo.bar and hoping someone does (import foo.bar)?
[23:10:26] <mdhughes> You're a user happily importing some library. The library owner makes it into a password cracker.

[23:13:18] <gwatt> Without doing any fact-checking, I assume github is special cased to only treat as git, since you presumably don't have to check what kind of repo it is; they're always git.
[23:20:01] <fizzie> There are four special-cased code hosting sites (Bitbucket, GitHub, Launchpad, IBM DevOps), and the special-casing is just that they have an import path that doesn't require specifying the repository type (by adding ".bzr", ".fossil", ".git", ".hg" or ".svn"), nor the service having to respond to the special `...url from path...?go-get=1` response with the right meta tags that will tell Go the type

[23:41:37] <amazigh> I remember at school an IBMer came for a presentation a full day, it was all about -ism stuff
[23:41:53] <fizzie> FWIW, in the Go case, the `go.sum` adjunct file (which by convention is also checked into the repository) also records a content checksum for the specific version of the module being depended on, and dependency versions never change automatically (only as response to manual `go get` or `go mod tidy` commands), so whether you're vendoring your dependencies or not, hypothetically you could do the
[23:41:55] <fizzie> same sort of source code audit of the entire transitive dependency tree every time you decide to version bump. Not that "anyone" does. But still.
