[13:07:40] <interop_madness> if you get the Krone too angry, you are shit out of luck ^^
[13:08:38] <bomb> that's too much power for a newspaper
[13:09:30] <interop_madness> yeah, french TV station arte had a documentary on this paper a decade or so ago, it wasn't flattering, and it resulted in Krone removing the station from it's tv schedule pages altogether
[13:10:47] <Nasp> Regardless of lockdown or no lockdown, it feels like the people in charge are fucking idiots and have no idea what they are really doing
[13:11:56] <interop_madness> I'm increasingly unsure whether a political government can be anything other than an idiot, except due to sheer luck, given the increasing complexity and interconnectedness of our system
[13:11:59] <Tazy> Is there a way to at runtime cast an object? I have the type info
[13:12:04] <bomb> post-1800s government systems barely work
[13:12:09] <canton7> Tazy, example?
[13:12:45] <Tazy> ` task.Complete((task.OutputType.TypeHandle) indexedOutputs[i]);` OutputType is created with typeof
[13:12:47] <canton7> ("Cast" can mean many different things depending on context, annoyingly)
[13:13:04] <Tazy> This was using JObject, and then .ToObject
[13:13:06] <Nasp> interop_madness:  Still can't you make informed choices based on fact and common basic logic
[13:13:16] <canton7> Tazy, what type does task.Complete take?
[13:14:05] <interop_madness> Nasp, on the one hand yes, on the other hand, with twitter and all, there will always be a loud opposition using some unpleasant effect of your policy against you
[13:14:31] <interop_madness> so whatever you do, you "failed" because X doesn't work as intended anymore, even though you were optimizing for Y
[13:14:31] <Tazy> `task.Complete(Convert.ChangeType(indexedOutputs[i], task.OutputType.GetType()));` , canton7 so task is a CalculationTask, that has a pyblic Type OutputType, and object result
[13:14:35] <Nasp> interop_madness:  Take this example, i'm not allowed to go to a restaurant without having a corona negative test
[13:14:48] <Nasp> But i can travel to Africa or UK or whatever there are new variants and bring it home
[13:14:53] <Nasp> Where's the logic in that
[13:14:56] <canton7> Tazy, is injdexOutputs an array of JObject, and you're trying to deserialize it into an object?
[13:15:13] <bomb> interop_madness did you hear about this guy? https://stessnews.online/2021/11/17/germany-dr-thomas-jendges-head-of-clinic-commits-suicide-covid-19-vaccine-is-a-genocide/
[13:15:36] <interop_madness> Nasp, maybe, they were afraid that stopping international air travel would result in a market downturn
[13:15:40] <Tazy> canton7, so its an array of objects right now, it was JObject, but moving away from newtonsoft
[13:15:45] <canton7> Tazy, wait, where did Convert.ChangeType come from? I'm even more confused

[13:47:13] <Nasp> Tazy:  Taht code looks yanky,  don't you know any of the  types since you are using object?
[13:48:36] <Tazy> Well yes, we go from I want output of type A back, then that gets packed into object, and then JObject, and then back :/
[13:49:03] <Tazy> I am still trying to make heads or tails from this one api call, how it goes from object magically to JObject
[13:49:14] <Tazy> and why we using JObject.ToObject
[13:49:21] <Tazy> instead of like deserialize
[13:49:30] <canton7> Tazy, yeah, once you've got that clear, you'll have a much easier time of it heh
[13:49:33] <Nasp> So you send a batch of different tasks with different types to this endpoint
[13:49:42] <Nasp> Or what is the structure of that return
[13:51:15] <Tazy> Nasp, basically and then it returns an array of results
[13:51:35] <canton7> Tazy, The problem you've got is that each elelement in your json response needs to be deserialized as a different type. At the point that you receive the response, you don't know what type to deserialize each element of the response as. However, you code knows what type each element needs to be deserialized as -- that's CalculationTask.OutputType.
[13:51:35] <canton7> So what you're doing is deserializing each element respnose as a JObject, which is a json.net type which just represents an arbitrary JSON object. Then you go through each of those and do a second deserialization step, where you actually deserialize each JObject into a specific C# type, using ToObject
[13:51:36] <Nasp> So it returns object A B and C?
[13:52:00] <canton7> *Deserializing each element in the response as a JObject
[13:52:14] <Nasp> What is the API in the other end ?
[13:52:16] *** Joins: inceptionflywho (~planetcal@user/planetcallwork/x-8157852)
[13:52:37] <Tazy> Nasp, a rate calculation engine
[13:53:10] <canton7> With regards to why 'object' gets turned into JObject -- 'object' is a pretty useless type, and it would be pointless if json.net just returned 'new object()' for each element in your deserialized response. So it picks some a more useful type, and the type that it chooses is JObject
[13:53:11] <Tazy> canton7, yeah basically. So is that the only way to do this? or can you deserialize each object ?
[13:53:46] <canton7> Tazy, it looks like this is the only way to do this: each element in the array in your response has a different type, and there's no way to tell json.net upfront "The object at index 0 is a SomeType. The object at index 1 is a SomeOtherType"
[13:54:02] <Tazy> Can System.Text.Json do this?
[13:54:04] <Nasp> Tazy:  And who controls that and what is it made in?
[13:54:14] <Tazy> Nasp, different team, but also C#
[13:54:16] <Nasp> And can you give an example on two different return types?
[13:54:19] <canton7> So you have to tell it "Don't bother actually deserializing each element in the array to a concrete C# object -- just use a placeholder, and I'll come along and tell you the types of each one one-by-one"
[13:54:38] <canton7> Tazy, not sure. JsonDocument / JsonElement might be able to do it -- those are the DOM-equivalent types
[13:54:44] <canton7> I think there was a lot of improvement in .NET 6 in this area
[13:55:05] <Tazy> Yeah, this project isn't on that yet, but getting there
[13:55:13] <canton7> If you're pre-.NET 5, you might be stuck deserializing each array element as a JSON string at first, and then doing another explicit deserialization of each
[13:55:29] <Tazy> Nasp, so the different return types, that you can JObject.ToObject, is just normal POCO's
[13:55:35] <canton7> Fundamentally, json.net is still more powerful than System.Text.Json, and that was always the intention
[13:55:46] <Nasp> Tazy: But i just wanted to be sure, they are totally different types right?
[13:55:55] <Nasp> And the ones you send to it, is also different types?
[13:56:16] <Tazy> Nasp, yeah, some results have the same base , but different subclasses
[13:56:33] <Nasp> Only some or all?
[13:56:35] <Tazy> canton7, but that is changing now right?
[13:56:51] <Tazy> Nasp, lets go with most
[13:56:54] <canton7> Tazy, eh, System.Text.Json is slowly getting more powerful, but it's never *meant* to be as feature-full as json.net
[13:57:04] <Nasp> Can't you just get the type information back from the other endpoint
[13:57:11] <canton7> Tazy, it's meant to be *fast*. That's the point. That's why MS wrote it, to speed up their web stack
[13:57:14] <Nasp> Newtonsoft has that $type parameter you can enable
[13:57:29] <Nasp> Yeah System.Text.Json is fast, but not as customizable
[13:57:45] <Tazy> So what do you do then, if you need speed. Use both?
[13:57:56] <Nasp> Do you really need that much speed?
[13:58:07] <Nasp> I think if you really need more performance, then i think you shouldn't use json
[13:58:09] <canton7> I strongly doubt json.net is your bottleneck

[13:58:34] <Nasp> Unless the payloads are huge
[13:58:53] <Nasp> Also if you are sending 10 API requests in one batch, then the API in the other end also ahve to do 10 times the amount of work to process it
[13:59:43] <canton7> And if the payloads are huge, deserializing the whole lot at once is probably fundamentally your problem
[14:00:02] <Tazy> canton7, well it appears to be, but also not deserializing from streams.
[14:00:15] <canton7> Tazy, have you profiled?
[14:00:26] <Tazy> app insights is showing that we sit and process for a long time, before the call reaches the other end and same coming back

[14:00:40] <Tazy> Nasp, agreed :p
[14:00:41] <Nasp> So yea huge payload
[14:00:55] <Nasp> Are oyu sending or receiving that
[14:00:55] <Tazy> Nasp, and that is a single payload, not multiple in that case
[14:00:59] <Tazy> Sending
[14:01:02] <Nasp> Like just 0.5MB is a large json payload
[14:01:09] <Nasp> How many are in that batch?
[14:01:13] <canton7> Tazy, Surely you can stream the response out as you serialize it?
[14:01:18] <Tazy> just 1 for that case
[14:01:21] <canton7> Serializing is going to be faster than actually sending the thing
[14:01:39] *** Quits: jinsun (~quassel@user/jinsun) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[14:01:40] <Tazy> canton7, current implementation isn't , I found this out when changing to System.Text.Json
[14:01:48] <canton7> Tazy, that's the #1 place I'd start then
[14:01:49] <Nasp> So in a case where you have 10, you will then have 70MB payloads?
[14:02:00] <canton7> The speed of json.net matters not a bit, so long as it's slower than actually sending the serialized json
[14:02:01] <Nasp> I really wish it was possible to get serializer metrics
[14:02:23] <Tazy> Nasp, in this case with that 7.7Mb payload, it won't be 10 payloads. Rather that 7.7Mb is 150 cars, it needs to handle 500 cars
[14:02:24] <canton7> *so long as it's faster than actually sending the serialized json
[14:02:48] <Nasp> So its 150 requests?
[14:03:22] <Tazy> Nasp, no one request, the POCO contains info on 150 cars. As I said with the 7.7Mb size, that is a single request, it won't be batched , or a batch of 1
[14:03:35] <Tazy> There are smaller requests that are batched, but this large one isn't
[14:03:45] <Nasp> Ok
[14:03:52] <Nasp> So you can't send just 1 car?
[14:04:14] <Tazy> Nasp, sadly no, because its a fleet, the premium is calculated based on all the cars
[14:04:48] <Tazy> canton7, I think you are right, would be worthwhile to benchmark, just changing to streams, but System.Text.Json.Http wraps that nicely though
[14:05:04] <Nasp> And will a 500 car payload take the same amount of space just multiplied up?
[14:05:13] <Tazy> pretty much
[14:05:21] <Nasp> So exceeding 25MB
[14:05:33] <canton7> Tazy, so does json.net: https://stackoverflow.com/a/22689976/1086121
[14:06:01] <Nasp> Do you get any kind of type information back from the API
[14:06:09] <Tazy> canton7, isn't that still manually making streams
[14:06:15] <canton7> Tazy, huh?
[14:06:47] <Tazy> the answer with 100 votes, that still you have to manage the streams right? System.Text.Json.Http does that for you
[14:07:04] <canton7> Right, but it's only a few lines
[14:07:12] <Tazy> Nasp, I don't think so but I can check
[14:07:45] <canton7> https://stackoverflow.com/a/25336271/1086121
[14:08:06] <Tazy> But wait. so if I am using System.Text.Json.Http. That does deserialize for me, so what, response is deserialized into a JObject, and then converted again to the POCO?
[14:08:13] <Tazy> Isn't that like double work ?
[14:09:22] <canton7> Tazy, meh, not much more: json.net needs to go through an intermediate step between the textual json and the deserialized C# object, and IIRC that intermediate step looks a lot like JObject
[14:09:29] <Tazy> canton7, oh I like that Push method
[14:10:27] <canton7> Tazy, that's for posting of course. For receiving, just grab the response as a stream and stick that into json.net
[14:11:16] <Tazy> But I have a question though on the Async streaming, before it can be converted to a POCO the whole stream has to be read right?

[16:24:32] <MaNa2k> how do you match string to enum string, not the number
[16:26:21] <MaNa2k> public enum Types{Customer = 1, Project = 2, .....}   string type= "customer";  how can i match my string to the first enum ?
[16:26:40] <inceptionflywho> MaNa2k, the reason I asked is because in such interviews a few additional things also carry weight
[16:26:47] <Babbage> hmm anyone think of how you can wack into an sql statement the equivalent of select * from table where field like '%XXX%' where XXX comes from a SELECT field from othertable, and may have many rows...
[16:27:09] <inceptionflywho> you should ensure you follow recommended coding conventions. Typically, resharper defaults are good at identifying those
[16:27:32] <Tazy> check this otu https://github.com/dahomey-technologies/Dahomey.Json, this can help  with system.text.json
[16:27:32] <MaNa2k> inceptionflywho, well they specified it to be a console app, i could overengineer and make something fancy, but that's just show that i like to waste time
[16:28:06] <MaNa2k> inceptionflywho, ah i see
[16:28:06] <inceptionflywho>  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[16:30:15] <MaNa2k> havnt used resharper before
[16:30:29] <MaNa2k> so im not familiar, but i think i got a fairly oki coding convention

[18:29:08] *** Joins: cn-j (~cn-j@user/cn-j)
[18:29:20] <jonp> why? Incognito mode is mostly about cookies (not reused across sessions).
[18:29:27] <canton7> MaNa2k, browsers in incognito mode typically save your history until you close the session
[18:29:30] <jonp> and that would make for a really sucky experience if you couldn't go back.
[18:29:34] <jonp> or forward
[18:29:47] <jonp> and if they had *no* cookies, you couldn't login to most sites, so cookies are needed, just temporary.
[18:30:03] <MaNa2k> jonp, yes but if you accidently close a tab, you cant get it back with incognito mode

[19:18:52] <canton7> Tazy, that depends on what you're trying to do....
[19:19:04] <canton7> All of the different Stream subclasses do different things
[19:19:25] <Tazy> Please tell me there is a nice blog that shows the differences :p ?
[19:19:30] * Tazy says so hopefully 
[19:20:00] <canton7> Tazy, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.stream?view=net-6.0, click "Show more" under "Derived", then read the docs for each
[19:20:26] <canton7> Hmm, that's only a subset of them
[19:20:30] <canton7> What are you trying to d?
[19:20:32] <canton7> *to do?

[19:21:46] <_Shurik_> where each pixel described by a structure of strings "RED","GREEN","BLUE"

[19:22:09] <Tazy> I just want to read a stream of json, and deserialize
[19:22:41] <Tazy> Also write json
[19:22:45] <Tazy> and send
[19:23:09] <canton7> There are multiple problems in there. Let's unpack them.
[19:23:48] <canton7> "I just want to read a stream of json, and deserialize" -- you're using HttpClient I assume? So the stream you'll be reading is the one you get back from HttpClient, you don't have a choice
[19:23:55] *** Joins: tlf (~tlf@mobile-166-170-20-188.mycingular.net)

[19:24:07] <Tazy> Following
[19:24:36] <Tazy> Yeah its a System.Io.Stream, when reading
[19:24:39] <Tazy> But when sending ?
[19:24:48] <canton7> If you're looking to write to a stream and have that data immediately sent to a server as part of a request -- so you're streaming data out as it becomes serialized -- then I linked you to PushStreamContent earlier :)
[19:25:26] <Tazy> So with that one, won't it help to have both API's use that ?
[19:25:30] <alguien_> JakeSays: The problem I previously pinged you about was that I was missing some references in my compilation. So now my question is: how can I analyze my whole project and make sure that its references are included automatically?
[19:25:53] <alguien_> oh wait, he's not here :(
[19:26:02] <canton7> Tazy, What do you mean, "both APIs"/
[19:26:35] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  Also when im sick i usually fall asleep or cant concentrate enough to see a show
[19:26:40] <Tazy> canton7, this is one API talking to another. So when I use PushStreamContent, to "send" data, the other side , can then also use it, when I read?

[21:21:48] <MatthiasVance> Yes
[21:22:45] <MatthiasVance> They had 3 things: 1) Indications about expressing my discontent in a particular way (nothing concrete though), 2) I cleaned the laptop for reuse 3) I didn't work a full day last day
[21:23:40] <MatthiasVance> 1) I was just transparent to my team about what happened, nothing out of the ordinary 2) Yes I did because everybody does that and has always requested that :o 3) I worked extra hours the day before to prepare knowledge transfer, clean PC, push to GitHUb etc..
[21:23:54] <MatthiasVance> They didn't even call me with questions lol
[21:23:59] <MatthiasVance> It was just this mail

[21:43:56] <tlf> tbh, this place is so chaotic that even if I painted fucking lines on the floors like they do in hospitals, they'd still never be able to connect the dots

[21:44:46] <tlf> MatthiasVance, yeah I know. just being a dope
[21:45:08] <tlf> well
[21:45:41] <tlf> we had a major outtage caused by two departments refusing to take ownership of a UPS that had expired batteries. We lost a phase to our main data center, which the batteries couldn't hold
[21:45:46] <MichaelLong> nais, intraday of -2.5k€ today for me. everthing is red :(
[21:46:15] <MatthiasVance> tlf: Wow :o What was the fallout of that>?
[21:46:17] <tlf> which killed 4 core routers, all 4 of which were suggested to be replaced due to a known issue with sudden power loss.
[21:46:37] <tlf> but the company, again, decided to wave off that suggestion because "its working now"
[21:46:43] <tlf> "we'll never lose power there"

[22:09:50] <MichaelLong> stuff will go up anyways again

[22:10:16] <MatthiasVance> *in YOUR
[22:12:30] <MichaelLong> ok but how do you invest -7.5K€, MatthiasVance?
[22:13:37] <MatthiasVance> Should have thought about that before? xD
[22:14:32] <Nasp> When is the dip gone so i can buy the dip
[22:17:04] <MichaelLong> thought of that too, already made some liquidity ready to buy them dip!
[22:17:21] <MatthiasVance> So you are investing while still working a job?
[22:17:52] <MatthiasVance> I was doing the same thing actually :P But figured I'd rather get rid of the job
[22:17:59] <MichaelLong> wrong, working is like a hobby next to investing, MatthiasVance
[22:18:11] <MatthiasVance> So much for freedom :D
[22:19:00] <MichaelLong> MatthiasVance, but wait, did I really read you old job is shitting you over by 300€ for something?
[22:19:18] <MichaelLong> could not really believe that, thought it is some twisted exit-joke or something
[22:19:22] <MatthiasVance> Yes, it's not about the money it's about giving me yet another big "fuck you" I think
[22:19:34] <MichaelLong> crazy

[22:24:00] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: I figured as much
[22:24:07] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: So how old will you be when you retire?
[22:24:16] <Nasp> That depends on how well these stonks will do
[22:24:23] <Nasp> Current retirement age is 74+
[22:24:30] <Nasp> Which is why i want to invest so ican lower it
[22:24:37] <MatthiasVance> Jeez
[22:24:50] <Nasp> And the retirement fund wants me to invest mroe money
[22:24:57] <Nasp> But they can't lower my retirement age
[22:25:02] <Nasp> Due to it being regulated by the government
[22:25:53] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Start a business
[22:27:30] <Nasp> Dont really have the drive for that right now
