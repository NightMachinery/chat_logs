[01:42:30] <d76d5436757> bookworm: I've updated my header auth PR. Something that I have decided not to include is the type for the authentication. If header based authentication is enabled, then all auth requests are checked with the header. If a type is passed, we will be changing the fundamental structure of TL's auth system—there's a priority of authentication and
[01:42:30] <d76d5436757> the first one that is available and enabled is the one that is used. Adding a type to the authentication will undermine that assumption and also not follow the current structure of TL's auth system.

[23:21:44] <johncs> but removing it seems acceptable too. If we do, I think having it print out a hint to use disconnect might help guide users to what they’re trying to do
