[00:34:41] <manicennui> WTF
[00:34:49] <manicennui> A friend just linked to a video of Silent Library.
[00:39:09] * ngoldbaum discovers his car tires are all a little flat
[00:39:17] <ngoldbaum> i should check that more often
[00:39:30] * ngoldbaum waits patiently for the compressor
[00:39:45] <manicennui> My rental car had that problem and told me about it.
[00:40:10] <manicennui> Was surprised that a pretty basic Nissan Sentra had that feature.
[00:42:14] <ngoldbaum> had what? a compressor?
[00:42:26] <ngoldbaum> i’m using the one i normally use with my bike
[00:42:54] <manicennui> No, a low tire pressure sensor.
[00:44:10] <ngoldbaum> i think all new cars might need to have them?
[00:44:12] <ngoldbaum> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Recall_Enhancement,_Accountability_and_Documentation_Act
[00:44:13] <buttsbot> Transportation Recall Enhancement - Wikipedia
[00:44:24] <ngoldbaum> back when congress passed laws
[00:46:06] <manicennui> Ah.
[00:46:21] <bontaq> obama is looking down with shame at your underinflated tires
[00:46:51] <manicennui> Fortunately I was able to luck into a tire shop that filled them for free.
[00:47:43] <manicennui> I was looking for a service station and saw what looked like an auto shop, so started to pull in there, then noticed that it was actually a hotrod shop, but there was a filling station next to it. Pulled into the filling station and then noticed that there was a tire place just next to it.
[00:48:08] <manicennui> Think they were supposed to be 42 pounds and were down to 28 pounds.
[00:50:12] <gwozniak> Our 2011 Toyota Corolla has low tire pressure sensors
[00:50:24] <gwozniak> And it's a pretty basic car
[00:50:27] <manicennui> I haven't owned a car in 14 years.
[00:50:41] <manicennui> Back in my day, your car didn't tell you shit and we liked it!
[00:50:47] <manicennui> Actually we didn't.
[00:50:51] <gwozniak> We are reluctant car owners
[00:51:10] <manicennui> I think reverse cameras are one of the best features that have been added to cars.
[00:52:31] <manicennui> And the proximity sensors.
[00:57:44] <gwozniak> Our car is old enough that we don't have those things
[00:57:51] <gwozniak> I think all new cars have them
[00:57:51] <bkero> Reverse cameras are an unfortunate side effect of cars getting too big for proprioception to work well.
[00:58:20] <bkero> Stop buying land yachts
[00:58:38] <gwozniak> And our car is small enough that the reverse camera doesn't really matter much
[00:59:02] <bkero> The idea of a reverse camera on my Miata is laughable
[00:59:36] <manicennui> bkero: They are nice even on smaller cars. The Sentra I rented wasn't very large.
[01:00:08] <manicennui> Lot easier to get really close to something when parking too.
[01:00:21] <bkero> Sure, they allow you drive without knowing the dimensions of your car, but should yoy really be driving if you don't know that?
[01:00:52] <gwozniak> Most people drive like that (and have for some time)
[01:01:03] <manicennui> Knowing the dimensions of your car and being extremely accurate about reversing are two different things.

[01:05:19] <bkero> You mean as is required on a driving test to parallel park?
[01:05:47] <manicennui> Do any states truly make people parallel park?
[01:05:58] <manicennui> Here we just had to park next to the curb, but it wasn't actually between to cars.
[01:05:58] <bkero> Montana and California did for me.
[01:06:05] <gwozniak> Lots of people parallel park for the test and then never do it again
[01:06:07] <manicennui> s/to/two/
[01:06:16] <manicennui> I also live in Chicago.
[01:06:37] <manicennui> But parallel parking is actually somewhat common in the downtown areas of smaller cities in NC.
[01:06:42] <gwozniak> When I took my driving test (many years ago), I literally drove around for 10 minutes, never parked, maybe made one left turn, and I got my license
[01:07:10] <manicennui> I basically drove around the block, had to park next to a curb to check that I turned the wheel the right way, and parked in a spot.
[01:07:25] <manicennui> It was a joke.
[01:07:42] <gwozniak> Yeah, my driving school stuff was much harder
[01:07:52] <manicennui> I never went to driving school.
[01:08:05] <gwozniak> And driving around a farm when I was 12 taught me more than the school did
[01:08:06] <manicennui> I got my license at 18, and all you had to do was take the written and driving test.
[01:08:16] <manicennui> I drove a handful of times before I took the test.
[01:08:37] <gwozniak> I drove a shitty Chevy farm truck for years before I got a license
[01:08:46] <gwozniak> And occasionally a tractor
[01:09:53] <gwozniak> I had to take driver's education to keep my insurance rates lower. No idea if that is still a thing
[01:10:14] <gwozniak> Hell, might not have been a thing 30+ years ago. But my parents made me do it
[01:10:46] <manicennui> Most people took driver's ed in school when I was in high school, but I had a compressed schedule and graduated a semester early.
[01:11:00] <manicennui> And instead of my one period of study hall I was a page for the biology department.
[01:11:32] <manicennui> I think the requirements became much tougher a few years after I got my license.
[01:12:32] <manicennui> Someone has to sign an affidavit verifying that the student has performed so many hours of driving and such I believe.
[01:14:06] <manicennui> https://www.ilsos.gov/departments/drivers/teen_driver_safety/gdl.html
[01:14:14] <manicennui> "Must practice driving a minimum of 50 hours, including 10 hours at night, supervised by a parent or adult age 21 or older with a valid driver’s license."
[01:14:54] <gwozniak> Yes, it's harder here now too
[01:15:13] <manicennui> It looks like if I were 18 today and wanted to do what I did, I'd have to take a 6-hour course.
[01:15:21] <gwozniak> We have a graduated licensing system, so you don't get your full license right away
[01:15:35] <manicennui> Yeah, this looks similar.
[01:16:24] <manicennui> There is this conflict in the US where we'd be better off making it harder to get licenses to reduce accidents, but not having a license severely restricts your ability to survive.
[01:16:41] <manicennui> Outside of a few cities.
[01:16:54] <manicennui> I think there are New Yorkers who never get their licenses.
[01:17:52] <gwozniak> It's becoming less common here, too.  Still very popular, though.
[01:18:28] <gwozniak> I know a couple of people who have never gotten them, both in thie late 60s/early 70s
[01:23:24] <manicennui> I only really use mine on vacation now.
[01:23:32] <manicennui> Which has been once every couple of years.
[01:23:55] <manicennui> If I went somewhere overseas I would probably try to rely on public transportation.
[01:23:59] <manicennui> And cabs.
[01:25:49] * manicennui is learning far too much about hentai from YT.
[01:26:03] <riv> what have you learned?
[01:26:18] <manicennui> I learned about ugly bastards.

[01:29:08] * manicennui likes sex weirdos
[01:29:22] <Brekkjern> I just love that video
[01:29:27] <Brekkjern> It's the perfect amount of dumb :P
[01:30:38] <manicennui> Watching this cute little blonde talk about this stuff is... weird.
[01:32:26] <manicennui> She is far more vulgar than most men I know.
[01:32:57] <manicennui> Now I know that orc hentai exists.
[01:33:26] <Brekkjern> Have you heard of rule 34?
[01:33:32] <Brekkjern> Not as in the concept, but as in the actual rule?
[01:33:53] <manicennui> Not sure.
[01:34:00] <Brekkjern> Rule 34: If it exists, there is porn of it. No exceptions.
[01:34:04] <Brekkjern> Rule 35: If there is no porn of it, porn will be made of it.
[01:34:08] <Brekkjern> Rule 36: No matter what it is, it is somebody's fetish.
[01:34:13] <Brekkjern> Rule 37: No matter how fucked up it is, there is always worse than what you just saw.
[01:34:21] <manicennui> I realize that everything exists, but they are talking about it like it is a substantial genre of hentai.
[01:34:41] <manicennui> And this girl is into it.
[01:34:45] <Brekkjern> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[01:34:55] <riv> link me this video please?
[01:34:56] <Brekkjern> That is by no means the most fucked up shit from hentai
[01:35:21] <manicennui> riv: The account name on YT is sydsnap.
[01:35:36] <manicennui> Brekkjern: I realize that.
[01:37:43] <manicennui> Why does there seem to be a hint of humiliation to so much Japanese entertainment?
[01:39:37] * manicennui learns about inflation.
[01:40:03] <Brekkjern> Money printer goes BRRRRRR, or the other kind?
[01:40:04] <Brekkjern> :P
[01:40:17] <manicennui> Another kind...
[01:40:35] <manicennui> I feel like we need an adult version of this channel.
[01:42:13] <Brekkjern> She needs to unfcuk the gain on the microphone though
[01:42:24] <Brekkjern> Or add a compressor
[01:43:02] <riv> ok I am learning about ugly bastards too now
[01:44:18] <Brekkjern> Sooo... There might be something to that "anime thesis" video I linked earlier? :P
[01:44:37] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Pfft. I was already broken before learning about this shit.
[01:45:14] <Brekkjern> Well, sure...
[01:45:35] <manicennui> And you'll never see me with a waifu pillow.

[01:58:39] <manicennui> I'm also not aware of such a channel where such discussion would be more appropriate on libera.

[02:09:15] <ngoldbaum> just got an earful from my neighbor about minor property crimes in the neigbborhood
[02:09:47] <ngoldbaum> i think the availability of cheap surveillance cameras is probably bad for a certain kind of person’s mental health
[02:10:09] <manicennui> Most suburbanites would lose their minds in a major city.
[02:11:09] <ngoldbaum> she seemed surprised when i informed her that the police don’t care about or investigate minor property crimes
[02:11:44] <manicennui> In Chicago they don't even investigate most shootings.

[02:20:42] <manicennui> Why not
[02:20:47] <manicennui> ?
[02:21:03] <manicennui> Most channels were somewhat NSFW back then.
[02:21:20] <manicennui> Unless they were super focused on some programming language or OS or something.
[02:21:24] <manicennui> But even then...
[02:22:38] <cb> i can't imagine it being full of anything but horny neckbeards
[02:22:46] <cb> which, if you're into horny neckbeards...
[02:22:59] <manicennui> That's the only type of person who was on the Internet in 99.
[02:27:56] <manicennui> Especially IRC.
[02:28:42] <edk> i'm not convinced
[02:29:26] <edk> internet kinda, but IRC wasn't chat for nerds back then, it was more or less the only chat thing
[02:29:48] <cb> dude, normal people used irc in 99
[02:29:50] <cb> out of necessity
[02:30:50] <manicennui> No.
[02:31:05] <manicennui> Normal people never used IRC.
[02:31:32] <manicennui> AIM existed in 97.
[02:31:50] <manicennui> And ICQ in 96.
[02:32:20] <manicennui> I started using IRC around maybe 97.
[02:32:53] <manicennui> And I definitely used AIM and ICQ for a while because they were super popular.
[02:46:11] <manicennui> Based on the information I can find, IRC was used by around 1% of all Internet users in 2001, AIM was used by almost 10%, and ICQ was used by about 20% of people on the Internet.
[02:46:15] <manicennui> IRC has always been niche.
[02:56:50] <dimadima> yeah normal ppl never used IRC
[02:56:59] <dimadima> not in my experience. maybe in europe or something
[02:57:37] <dimadima> i saw a lot of IRC channels advertised by quake servers/clans
[02:57:41] <manicennui> I've met some non-tech people on IRC, but they were all weirdos.
[02:57:45] <dimadima> maybe that was the normal crowd
[02:58:13] <manicennui> I was on the Internet for over a year before I even discovered IRC.

[03:48:39] * Xe face-desks
[03:48:50] <manicennui> I wonder whether making the NFTs uses as much resources as making some kind of physical figures
[03:49:01] * Xe face-desks 28.5 more times
[03:49:23] <edk> i don't think making NFTs is particularly resource intensive
[03:50:06] <manicennui> Probably depends on the blockchain technology, but I assume it isn't terrible.
[03:50:38] <manicennui> But I bet that most NFTs will be inaccessible within a few years.
[03:50:46] <edk> yeah that seems likely
[03:51:52] <ngoldbaum> i think the ethereum ones use a lot?
[03:52:19] <ngoldbaum> it’s hard to say exactly how much since miners are often in places that have very cheap excess electricity loads
[03:53:02] <edk> that's a similar sort of logic to the logic that says offsetting makes sense though
[03:53:37] <edk> in that if the miners weren't there we could probably get that electricity somewhere else

[19:04:34] <ngoldbaum> gerikson: what about it?
[19:05:03] <gerikson> bit esoteric
[19:05:14] <ngoldbaum> riv: hard-drive.net is a parody site, fwiw
[19:05:15] <riv> i study category theory and nothing corbin says makes sense to me
[19:05:32] <gerikson> ``MarshallB uses the category of presheaves over second-countable locally-compact sober topological spaces. “second-countable” is a limitation on how infinite the spaces can be, “locally-compact” is a kind of convenience condition that gives us our internal lambda calculus, and “sober” ensures that we will find points if we go looking for them.''
[19:06:08] <riv> i haven't been able to figure out if thats my fault or his
[19:07:01] <gerikson> I don't doubt he's smart as heck
[19:12:35] <dimadima> riv: ah
[19:12:53] <dimadima> yeah i've seen some foones that easily approach 40
[19:13:09] <dimadima> hey, whatever works
[19:15:44] <riv> what?
[19:16:35] <dimadima> if tweet-blogging is your format... that's your format?
[19:17:08] <dimadima> fooone tweeted how if there was only blogging he'd never blog
[19:17:42] <dimadima> riv: oh i was responding about the long twitter blog-threads
[19:17:57] <riv> ahh
[19:23:46] <ngoldbaum> ocd is a helluva drug
[19:24:24] <riv> ?
[19:36:32] <ngoldbaum> i guess it’s adhd
[19:36:40] <ngoldbaum> the reason foone doesn’t blog
[19:39:11] <riv> ah
[19:39:20] <riv> i dont know this character at all
[20:21:15] <gerikson> yeah I remember him explaining it that way
[20:30:50] <dcz> exact real arithmetics? maybe in infinite time...
[20:31:19] <dcz> or space? that paper could use a TL;DR, if at all possible
[20:33:52] <riv> you do it lazy
[20:34:16] <riv> so when you actually print out the ansewr to 10 decimal places, it requires 11 places from all the numbers involved in that expression, and so on
[20:37:13] <dcz> that's one definition of "exact" :P
[20:38:38] <dcz> lazy calculation would require some proofs about convergence of all the real numbers involved
[20:41:43] <riv> yes
[20:46:53] <Brekkjern> Why is it 25C and 60% humidity inside here?
[20:47:54] <ngoldbaum> seems pretty pleasant tbh
[20:48:23] <Brekkjern> It's 2C too hot, and at least 10% more humidity than comfortable

[20:54:21] <Brekkjern> Yep
