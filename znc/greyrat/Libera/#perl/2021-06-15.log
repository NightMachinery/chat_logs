[00:41:48] <genio> Does anyone actually use MSVC to compile Perl? Strawberry pretty much _is_ Perl on Windows. It doesn't use MSVC. Don't get me wrong, yes, remove support for old things holding us back, but is MSVC _really_ used?
[00:42:26] * genio should never read the P5P list
[00:44:55] <Grinnz> i don't think anyone has argued against removing msvc support
[00:45:20] <xenu> mod_perl comes to my mind as a reason to use msvc
[00:45:29] <xenu> it *is* possible to use mod_perl with strawberry, but with msvc perl it's easier
[00:45:32] <ilmari> Grinnz: msvc in general, or msvc6?
[00:45:33] <xenu> also msvc perls are easier to debug
[00:45:40] <Grinnz> msvc6
[00:45:46] <Grinnz> as was propsoed
[00:46:03] <xenu> also as long as we stick to new msvc versions i don't think it's a burden to support them
[00:46:15] <xenu> they support c11 and everything
[00:47:00] <xenu> we need to drop support for msvc 2012 and earlier and PSC recently proposed to do that
[00:47:16] <xenu> (msvc 2013 is the first version with c99 support)
[00:47:31] <genio> Grinnz: no, I don't think anyone opposed it. it just kind of caught me by surprise. I happened to read the platforms and support one prior to reading that and it had me in a pffft mood then I read that one and thought "really? msvc is supported?"
[00:48:06] <ilmari> fwiw postgres also only support msvc 2013 and up
[00:48:12] <xenu> *the* biggest problem right now for me is windows 2000/xp support
[00:48:33] <xenu> it's completely unacceptable that if you want to make non-trivial contributions to the windows port of perl you need to have a vm with an unspported windows version
[00:48:48] <genio> I already tried to get that nixed and got naysayed to death and nitpicked 
[00:48:51] <xenu> and win2k/xp are firmly in the retrocomputing zone
[00:49:19] <ilmari> genio: how about proposing demoting it to the "might work, but no guarantee" tier?
[00:49:34] <xenu> by *it* you mean old windowses?
[00:49:34] <ilmari> or whatever comes out of Nicolas' proposal
[00:49:39] <genio> more or less "rip support out for this ancient OS that nobody actually uses but me for this one stupid pet project out of my cold dead hands"
[00:49:39] <ilmari> xenu: yes

[00:51:33] <xenu> also i'd like to avoid the situation when someone submits patches for xp support
[00:51:39] <genio> makes me throw up the middle fingers
[00:51:41] <ilmari> xenu: do you actually need to be running on xp/2k to be able to at least build it? or could you build on a newer OS targeting the old one?
[00:51:46] <Grinnz> if they're gonna send it at you and not the public proposal then they should be given exactly that much regard in return.
[00:52:45] <xenu> ilmari: you can build it on a newer version, in fact strawberry is being built on win10 and it works on xp
[00:52:51] <xenu> but you need to test it
[00:53:04] <xenu> somehow
[00:53:35] <xenu> btw, the fact that a perl build on win10 must work on xp is one of the problem with supporting old windowses, we can't detect stuff at compile time

[05:17:46] <xenu> can someone paste those notices?
[05:22:07] <pflanze> I think I asked something like this before but am not sure what the answer was: is there any exporter module that lets me export *copies* of a global scalar variable?
[05:23:29] <Grinnz> that's not how exporting works
[05:23:45] <pflanze> I want this: package Foo{ @EXPORT= qw($foo); our $foo = "Hi!"; }  package Bar { Foo->import('$foo'); $foo = 1 }  package Baz { Foo->import('$foo'); use Test::More; is $foo, "Hi!" }
[05:23:55] <Grinnz> it's by definition an alias, but you could use your custom import sub to assign new copies instead
[05:24:30] <Grinnz> seems like a fragile idea
[05:25:00] <pflanze> It's anti-fragile :)
[05:25:01] <Grinnz> why bother exporting it if it's not going to correlate to anything in the package you're improting from?
[05:25:16] <pflanze> I usually find myself wanting this with regular expressions.
[05:25:49] <kiwiroy> xenu: the freenode global ones?
[05:25:50] <Grinnz> if you just want to make a value available, you can assign it in your import sub but 'once' warnings will complain

[05:27:26] <pflanze> How are you exporting regexes? as "use constant" thingies?
[05:27:39] <Grinnz> usually, yes
[05:27:46] <Grinnz> but that will alias, of course
[05:28:01] <Grinnz> doesn't matter since it can't be assigned to
[05:28:07] <Grinnz> or at least, doesn't matter in the same way
[05:28:17] <pflanze> Alias? It will copy, no?
[05:28:25] <Grinnz> the subroutine will alias, i mean
[05:28:27] <pflanze> I mean, the regex
[05:28:28] <Grinnz> like a normal export
[05:28:28] <pflanze> ok
[05:28:30] <xenu> kiwiroy: yeah, but someone already gave me them in PM
[05:28:44] <xenu> tbh i think it's a good think they decided to kill freenode
[05:28:54] <xenu> it's better than pretending that nothing happened
[05:28:57] <xenu> i wish they renamed it too
[05:29:02] <pflanze> The drawback of that approach is that you can't build new regexes from the imported ones via string interpolation.
[05:29:13] <Grinnz> yes, but constant subs are inlined by the parser
[05:29:14] <kiwiroy> xenu: true
[05:29:16] <xenu> the only problem is that i don't understand why the hell he bought that network
[05:29:22] <xenu> if that's what he's going to do
[05:29:29] <Grinnz> but its true, subs are inconvenient for regexes specifically
[05:29:55] <pflanze> my $own_regex = qr/&{foo} bar/ # does this work? I never used & for interpolation
[05:30:00] <Grinnz> no
[05:30:08] <Grinnz> anyway, every existing case of this just exports the variable normally
[05:30:17] <Grinnz> if someone assigns to it, that's their problem
[05:30:26] <pflanze> Heh. So, what I've been doing.
[05:31:04] <Grinnz> you can always set SvREADONLY on it if you want
[05:31:16] <pflanze> Oh, how?
[05:31:20] <Grinnz> i think that will stick to the export
[05:31:53] <Grinnz> declare it initially with Const::Fast or ReadonlyX, or use https://perldoc.perl.org/Internals#SvREADONLY(THING,-%5B,-$value%5D)
[05:31:54] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Internals - Reserved special namespace for internals related functions - Perldoc Browser ]
[05:32:26] <Grinnz> the latter isn't recursive but i'm not sure if that matters for regex refs
[05:33:19] <pflanze> Yes, doing deep readonly is another matter.
[05:33:35] <Grinnz> also, you don't "use Internals;", those functions are just available, as shown in synopsis

[07:33:05] <simcop2387> zgu: yea, see isfreenodedeadyet.com for slightly more details, but they've thrown away all nickname registrations, channel registrations and servers.
[07:33:14] <pragma-> yup, new ircd, nickserv/chanserv wiped, etc
[07:33:35] <simcop2387> i don't think the person running it thought it'd happen quite so quickly

[07:34:07] <simcop2387> Grinnz: i meant isfreenodedeadyet.com
[07:34:10] <Grinnz> oh
[07:34:39] <simcop2387> now there's squatters over all the former big channels and basically nobody left staff-wise (as far as i can see) to deal with places like ubuntu or redhat if they wanted to come back
[07:34:44] <Grinnz> yeah the whole process has been completely unpredictable at a low level, though at a high level, it's been clear for a long time it would go down in flames 
[07:35:08] <Grinnz> they won't, freenode doesn't recognize foss projects anymore
[07:35:13] <simcop2387> Grinnz: i didn't expect the clown prince to start the fire directly himself though

[07:36:28] <simcop2387> Grinnz: yea this might be more of a nuke it from orbit thing than a fire.  i guess that's what i didn't expect really
[07:36:38] * zgu looks at rindolf
[07:37:13] <xenu> it was a really good decision to move early and to hard close the channel
[07:37:17] <simcop2387> zgu: the irccloud bit i think was a big straw for a lot of people, and from what i saw using perlbot to spy on ##perl and #perl, basically nobody could keep the spammers in check and even the staff was quitting
[07:38:23] <simcop2387> i've gone and reregistered myself and perlbot just to protect them and watch the fire for a bit longer but i'm probably going to shut it off freenode again here this week and *actually* never turn it back on.  i brought it back because there were a few hold outs that wanted it (rindolf in particular) back but i don't see the point any longer
[07:38:25] <xenu> tbh i didn't expect the takeover to go *that* bad
[07:39:24] <Grinnz> i mean, about the time i made the old channel +mz is when i realized it would
[07:40:21] <simcop2387> they're now using an ircd and services packages that the authors of have said they would not give any support to freenode for running so we'll see how well this goes
[07:40:31] <simcop2387> 22:44 -!- There are 1456 users and 283 invisible on 11 servers
[07:40:33] <simcop2387> WOW
[07:40:40] <xenu> i mean it was clear that the community is behind libera, but i didn't expect rasengan to shoot himself in the foot so blatantly
[07:40:43] <xenu> multiple times
[07:40:46] <xenu> probably no one did
[07:40:48] <simcop2387> i guess it'll stablize a bit once lurkers disconnect but still
[07:41:22] <pragma-> hilariously, they didn't have email registrations working for the new servers at the time of the switchover
[07:41:39] <simcop2387> xenu: well the "ninjutsu" that he named himself after was one that would inadvertantly hurt and eventually cripple it's user... (at least once naruto finished it anyway)
[07:41:48] <xenu> i don't understand the numbers on isfreenodedead btw
[07:41:59] <xenu> i'm pretty sure the old part of freenode doesn't have 49k onlines users
[07:42:11] <xenu> and if it did, then the 116% ratio doesn't make sense at all
[07:42:14] <simcop2387> xenu: they're basically all invalid now because of the switchover and things getting fucked up, hence the "i'm gonna be turning this off"
[07:42:18] <Grinnz> two things were clear by that point: 1) andrew lee does not give a shit about foss or how freenode has historically run, 2) andrew lee will do what he wants
[07:42:34] <Grinnz> i don't see how any community, nevermind foss communities, can reasonably decide to operate in those conditions
[07:42:42] <simcop2387> #freenode is now invite only
[07:43:07] <simcop2387> and i've decided to register #leenode until i get kicked
[07:43:18] <gchristensen> unless that changed very recently, they somewhat recently made it -i
[07:43:34] <Grinnz> probably just dealing with spam
[07:43:38] <gchristensen> a lot of talk about pissnet
[07:43:45] <Grinnz> yeah, that'd be it :P
[07:44:01] <gchristensen> cold wets are always on topic for leenode
[07:44:23] <xenu> someone should make a good writeup of the whole drama, for the future generations
[07:44:33] <Grinnz> xenu: the ratio is libera's users over one of the old parts of the freenode network that the statsbot happens to be on
[07:44:39] <simcop2387> should i put #leenode has moved to libera.chat as the topic just to see what happens?
[07:44:53] <xenu> Grinnz: well yeah, but it also claims that freenode has 49k online users
[07:44:58] <Grinnz> where?
[07:45:04] <gchristensen> xenu: decidedly yes
[07:45:10] <simcop2387> Grinnz: right next to the 116%
[07:45:16] <Grinnz> i don't see that
[07:45:32] <Grinnz> Freenode Users (Latest) 26609users Libera Users (Latest) 32665users Users Ratio 122.8%
[07:45:35] <gchristensen> erm, simcop2387: decidedly yes
[07:45:51] <simcop2387> Grinnz: https://www.simcop2387.info/leenode.png is what i see
[07:46:15] <Grinnz> ah, the graph by month seems to be using less recent data
[07:46:24] <simcop2387> yea that does seem to be it

[07:49:35] <xenu> there were only like 2 projects that moved there, alpine linux and haiku
[07:49:45] <gchristensen> I tried to tell a staffer about that issue pragma- but https://twitter.com/grhmc/status/1404634241372241924 and then I realized I didn't actually want to offer even the slightest bit of help

[07:49:53] <zgu> yeah it doesn't seem like any significant channels moved to oftc
[07:49:53] <xenu> and probably there was a big overlap between people who were already on oftc and those who have chosen oftc

[15:19:35] <japh> it's everything above ascii
[15:20:01] <LeoNerd> ucfirst will definitely only do one character, the first one in the string
[15:20:13] <japh> super weird
[15:20:17] <LeoNerd> if you are seeing multiple chars being uc'ed, then you are calling it multiple times
[15:20:35] <LeoNerd> maybe you have a split/map/join going on?
[15:21:16] <japh> no but crazy concats: print $prefix.ucfirst($field)." #".($i+1).": ".$vals[$i]."\n"

[15:37:21] <japh> yes, I'm aware of that :)
[15:37:21] <fizzie> It's a "make the first character uppercase" function, not a "make the first character the only uppercase character there is" one.

[22:03:58] <Grinnz> that is what it ends up at?
[22:04:30] <Adura> Hah!
[22:04:52] <Grinnz> i don't actually know what you mean
[22:05:02] <Adura> The actual URL it ends up at.
[22:05:04] <Grinnz> the purpose is to follow redirects to get an actual title
[22:05:10] <Grinnz> oh, the url
[22:05:44] <Grinnz> the redirect following happens with Mojo::UA itself but the final url might be available
[22:06:05] <thrig> maybe flag it if it is the rickroll video, or something
[22:07:21] <Adura> https://perl6.org/ is a nice example.

[22:58:55] <Yaakov> genio: It was never a problem in *English* but thanks to a cult of Latin lovers who believed it was the perfect language, some people tried to impose a grammatical rule from it onto English.
[22:59:13] *** Joins: yzhernand (~yzhernand@129.85.9.140)
[22:59:50] <genio> hmmm. Today I learned.
[22:59:59] <Yaakov> genio: Prepositions, in English, should be placed where the make the most sense to a speaker of English and not violently shifted from the end of a sentence if that’s where they work best.
[23:00:08] <gryphn> English teachers shouldn't.

[23:00:48] <Yaakov> In fact it was a high school English teacher most responsible for the nonsense.

[23:01:50] <Yaakov> Churchill was a fan of Fowler. If you want to learn some very interesting things about English and languages, Fowler’s Modern English Usage (2nd Edition, NOT 3rd) is excellent.
