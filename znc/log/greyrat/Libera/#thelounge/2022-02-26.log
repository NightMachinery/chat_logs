[02:16:46] <MaxLeiter> Cienisty, you can open an issue on the docker repo if you want 
[02:23:41] <Cienisty> shadoozo: I can, but automatic updating is a nice option
[02:24:27] <Cienisty> I do not see the need to open issue on GH, I just wanted to ask and check the opinions of others
[02:24:31] <xnaas> Switching to the 4.3.0-alpine tag, for instance, would leave the same "issue" anyway.
[02:25:17] <MaxLeiter> Is “latest” built from git? Do we not have  a build for most recent tagged versions?

[02:27:22] <Cienisty> it is posible 
[02:27:56] <MaxLeiter> Would you be interested in submitting a PR?
[02:28:17] <MaxLeiter> It’d be appreciated
[02:29:10] <Cienisty> I'd love to, but if someone else could take care of it, it would be great, now I would like to finish a better PWA on IOS first, but I can't find the time :(
[02:30:35] <MaxLeiter> what would you change?
[02:30:45] <MaxLeiter> and if you cant submit a PR then please open an issue

[09:05:37] <misterpickles> hello
[09:05:53] <misterpickles> its late, i got thelounge working beautifully in pricate and public mode
[09:06:19] <misterpickles> im too dumb to integrate anope ldap with thelounge so that registered users can just use thelounge
[09:06:31] <misterpickles> or sasl or anything
[09:07:05] <misterpickles> is there a services package that does integrate easily and offer an ldap that thelounge can query? we arent married to unrealircd or anope
[09:08:05] <misterpickles> im about to go to sleep after an all nigter restorting their box but want to put thelounge up instead of kiwi if i can get pointed at a doc about how to make thelounge authenticate against existing servives users and registered nickserv namesç
[09:08:37] <misterpickles> if anyone knows the answer pls highlight me and ill love you when i read iit in the morning thank you.
[09:09:30] <misterpickles> im cool with blowing away all our registered users and making them re register too 
[09:09:32] <misterpickles> ty
[09:12:01] <misterpickles> kiwi works with sasl if they click "i have a password" and this client will work for us if i can make it that easy for registered users
[09:14:54] <misterpickles> im in mexico and just get very disapointing and irrelevant seach results on many tech topics half of whcih arent in english :=)
[09:21:19] <misterpickles> ps: anope themselves , did this and use ldap to log into their forums which i thinj is a cool idea too , but i didnt see them explaining how they did this
