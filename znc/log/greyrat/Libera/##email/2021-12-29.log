[01:05:39] *** Joins: ecdhe (~ecdhe@user/ecdhe)
[01:06:56] <ecdhe> I pay for a hosted IMAPS/SMTPS service on my domain.  I want to make an relay server on my lan that will download messages from the IMAP server based on a whitelist.
[01:08:35] <ecdhe> The whitelist would be email based, not domain or IP based.
[01:10:02] <lunaphyte> what does "based on" mean?
[01:11:44] <ecdhe> example: assuming the whitelist consists of the "alice@bob.com", only messages from that address would be retrieved
[01:12:16] <lunaphyte> the first step would be to determine if your imap service can support that
[01:12:46] <ecdhe> The IMAP service supports the retrieval or ignorance of every message it receives.
[01:13:14] <ecdhe> So it would be up to the client, such as offlineimap to enforce the whitelist
[01:13:14] <lunaphyte> the first step would be to determine if your imap service can support selective retrieval, given your criteria
[01:13:48] <lunaphyte> then the next step would be to find an imap client that does the same
[01:14:30] <ecdhe> offlineimap specifically appears to filter by IMAP tag, and by IMAP directory, but it's archivally minded and doesn't filter by address
[01:15:43] <ecdhe> I know several MTAs have source and destination whitelist capabilities, but they're only enforced on SMTP traffic before it hits the maildir, not on sitting maildirs
[01:16:00] <rob0> I think you would pull all the mail, then post-process it, such as with sieve
[01:16:41] <lunaphyte> mta behavior would be unrelated to the topic of imap
[01:19:08] <ecdhe> lunaphyte: I agree that MTA behavior is unrelated to the topic of IMAP, I was only commenting that one way to filter the messages available over IMAP would be to instruct the MTA to reject the unwanted ones.  Since I'm using a hosted MTA (not one that I control) using an MTA to perform the filtering would require me to take the messages on my hosted mail server and put them "in flight" again, which seems 
[01:19:14] <ecdhe> uneccesary
[01:19:21] <ecdhe> rob0: sieve may well be the tool for the job
[01:19:50] <lunaphyte> i'm not sure what you mean by in flight.  once the messages have been accepted, that's it.
[01:20:10] <lunaphyte> if you do not have enough control over the mta to do that, then it's irrelevant
[01:20:24] <ecdhe> lunaphyte: "in flight" ==> submit them to the SMTPs service of a second MTA
[01:20:31] <pj> !getmail
[01:20:33] <dig-dug> pj: getmail: Getmail is a secure, flexible, reliable and easy-to-use mail retriever for POP3 and IMAP4. It delivers mail into a Maildir or mbox file. It is designed to replace other mail retrievers such as fetchmail. See http://pyropus.ca/software/getmail/.
[01:20:34] <pj> !fetchmail
[01:20:36] <dig-dug> pj: fetchmail: A command-line tool to fetch emails from POP3/IMAP servers and send them to a (local) mail server.
[01:20:50] <lunaphyte> ecdhe: that's too late for rejection
[01:20:56] <pj> one of these probably, if they support selective retrieval ^^^^^
[01:21:24] <lunaphyte> anyway, i'm not aware of any imap clients which can selectively retrieve message based on sender
[01:28:09] <lunaphyte> a program would need to first perform an imap search command, and then given the returned message ids, retrieve those messages
[01:28:47] <lunaphyte> it's probably not conceptually difficult, but i don't know of clients that do that
[01:30:14] <ecdhe> lunaphyte: modifying offlineimap, a python client, is probably an effective way to do this.  I'm comfortable with the getmail+sieve option but it would certainly require more bandwidth than simply retrieving only the whitelisted messages.
[01:35:01] <lunaphyte> making or modifying something to selectively retrieve messages could be a fun project
[01:35:06] <ecdhe> An email scammer catfished my coworker's aging mother; she fell in love and attempted to wire him large sums of money to be able to afford airfare to come see her.
[01:35:40] <lunaphyte> yuck, that stinks
[01:36:57] <lunaphyte> note that imapfw was, at one point, intended to be the successor to offlineimap
[01:37:44] <ecdhe> My coworker resolved the issue eventually, but it made me wonder if an email whitelist could help.  By passing emails only from friends and relatives (and a couple relevant utilities) a senile person could enjoy communications with their family without having their remaining facilities deceived by scam emails.
[01:38:06] <ecdhe> Non-whitelisted emails could remain in the actual email account for a power-of-attourney to review.
[01:38:40] <lunaphyte> i would use an email service provider that allowed me to manage that
[01:40:24] <ecdhe> The same scheme could be handy for younger children learning to correspond with a couple friends and family members without exposing them and their devices to phishing, scams, unsolicited adult content.
[01:41:21] <lunaphyte> a good email service provider will provide a quarantine mechanism
[01:42:31] <lunaphyte> whether or not it provides for a deny by default policy though, is a different question
[01:42:48] <lunaphyte> or quarantine by default, rather, in this case
[01:43:33] <lunaphyte> i do think that would be a good thing, though - as long as the guardian is willing to accept the burden
[01:46:08] <lunaphyte> it pretty much boils down to a "parental controls" mechanism.  i'm not sure if i've seen such a mechanism, in the context of email
[01:47:15] <ecdhe> lunaphyte: it's not even bulletproof -- spam still arrives when your actual contact's accounts are compromised and their entire address book is contacted
[01:47:26] <ecdhe> So it doesn't guarantee spam won't arrive.
[01:52:02] <lunaphyte> nothing is perfect
[01:53:14] <ecdhe> lunaphyte, you've got me thinking in SaaS mode.  I wonder if I could MITM the IMAP connection.  So you login to imap.myservice.com and authenticate as lunaphyte@beardmail.net.  I lookup the credentials for your account, then login as lunaphyte on imap.beardmail.net.  When you request a LIST from me, I request a LIST from beardmail.net, but I filter the UUIDs in the list by the rules you've specified.  This 
[01:53:20] <ecdhe> way, if you bypass me and log into webmail.beardmail.net and delete a message, the message deletion will be immediately reflected in your imap.myservice.com session
[01:54:14] <ecdhe> Your mail contents would still pass through my server (because TCP) but I'd be freed from the requirement to store/cache your mail.
[01:56:29] <ecdhe> I'll have to test this on several large mailboxes.  But the performance is certainly improved if it turns out you only need to download a few KB of mail for every MB in the target mailbox
[01:59:31] <ecdhe> It's possible I'd need to scan the target IMAP account and cache some IMAP metadata (UUIDs) at account creation and whenever the user updates the filter criteria.  But if mail storage stayed out of scope, this could be a single-server app on a micro kernel instead of requiring TBs of cloud hosting.

[22:59:01] <velix> let me retry
[22:59:56] <Khepra> but that won't work over telnet as it requires tls  (smtpd_tls_auth_only=yes,   should be dfault, and if it isn't, you must set that)
[23:01:09] <velix> ahhh right
[23:02:34] <velix> I still can send without authentification. I'm giving up and will look for a freelancer.
[23:02:38] <velix> Thanks for your time :-)
[23:03:14] <Khepra> what's your budget?

[23:54:28] <velix> But this discussion is offtopic now :D
[23:55:12] <lunaphyte> my advice as it relates to that is to not let yourself get caught in the trap of fixating on those details [the number of users in a channel]
[23:55:23] <lunaphyte> join the channel, ask the question, and what happens happens
[23:56:02] <velix> lunaphyte: but don't forget to wear a mask ;)
