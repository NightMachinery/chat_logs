[00:43:42] <gerikson> jjuran: no doubt
[00:43:48] <gerikson> this was 30 years ago
[00:44:39] <jjuran> Lightspeed C was a rather clever name, but reusing the brand for a Pascal dev environment missed the opportunity to name it Blaze Pascal :-)
[00:45:00] <technomancy> lmao nice
[00:45:08] <wink> jjuran: 5th graders starting to program don't really need anything suited for real work. but even when I looked at Delphi years later, just not my cup of tea
[00:46:13] <jjuran> In hindsight, the best thing about learning Pascal is that it's nearly isomorphic to C.  Most concepts carry over very cleanly (albeit with different syntax).

[00:48:13] <bsandro> i remember back in highschool when we studied programming it was Turbo Pascal or Turbo C if you try to be different
[00:48:14] <jjuran> wink: I think 5th graders would be better served by a first language that doesn't allow use-after-free errors.
[00:48:34] <bsandro> (teachers didn't know C so the feeling of superiority was bundled)
[00:49:20] <ngoldbaum> my first programming language was qbasic
[00:49:24] <ngoldbaum> which seemed pretty ok
[00:49:27] <ngoldbaum> it had for loops
[00:49:31] <wink> jjuran: don't have a strong opinion on teaching languages for kids, really. not even a not-strong one :P was just relaying my pascal story and that it wasn't the language + my age, per se
[00:49:51] <gerikson> jjuran: lol
[00:49:56] <technomancy> I started on qbasic and then trying to learn C++ convinced me to stop doing programming for 6-7 years
[00:50:04] <geoffwozniak> ngoldbaum: Pascal for me, but that wasn't until university. I used Basic a little before
[00:50:06] <gerikson> I think my kid had a class in Lua
[00:50:17] <bsandro> plain basic on 8bit thingy for me too; partially because of that I was somewhat tech-savvy in school and got cocky with C and all
[00:50:24] <geoffwozniak> I didn't do much of any programming until uni
[00:50:43] <bsandro> then a programming contest was held in my town and ofc i participated and gloriously got 0 points

[17:32:01] <ignaloidas> isn't the main reason for using C is that it is the main programming language for POSIX
[17:32:31] <goodger> it's the main implementation language of unix, at least
[17:32:50] <companion_cube> ignaloidas: yes, that's the historical reason
[17:33:04] <goodger> which, incidentally, fuck unix
[17:33:07] <companion_cube> the C ABI will be around for a long, long time
[17:34:26] <c355e3b> Similar to how COM will never ever die ever
[17:35:28] <ignaloidas> at least COM had some potential at the time it was created
[17:36:00] <ngoldbaum>  C didn’t?
[17:36:17] <geoffwozniak> And hey, why not use "M$" while we're at it
[17:36:24] <ignaloidas> IMO yes
[17:37:13] <goodger> ah, I see
[17:37:33] <ngoldbaum> doesn’t the extremely large quantity of C code out there demonstrate C’s potential?
[17:37:39] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: C was mostly a regression compared to existing languages, because of Pdp-8 limitations
[17:37:51] <companion_cube> just like wordpress shows php's potential :p
[17:38:03] <ngoldbaum> i mean, if it pays the bills
[17:38:09] <geoffwozniak> But it caught on in systems use because it was available

[17:38:40] <ngoldbaum> not saying C is great
[17:38:46] <ngoldbaum> but no potential is a little much
[17:39:06] <goodger> is there some sort of mailing list I can subscribe to, to receive updates on what is transphobia?
[17:39:21] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: history will do that
[17:39:33] <companion_cube> I mean, js is also pretty high, and… ugh
[17:39:45] <ignaloidas> to clarify: no potential to improve upon status quo
[17:39:58] <companion_cube> "worse is better" indeed
[17:40:52] <goodger> the idea of ASCII character streams as ‘universal interface’ might be the most obvious mistake in computing

[19:01:03] <indigo> How big are your CSVs
[19:01:33] <mouseghost> like 4k rows
[19:01:36] <creature> Have you seen Visidata? I haven't used it, but I was quite excited by it.
[19:01:50] <mouseghost> ohhh interesting
[19:01:53] <creature> Like, I went "The next time I need to pull some stuff out of a CSV, this is what I'm trying first."
[19:02:06] <Lulu> The boring answer would be pandas on Python.
[19:02:07] <mouseghost> thanks meow
[19:02:08] <hoistbypetard> +1 for visidata
[19:02:12] <indigo> I’d go the SQL route if it was me, but maybe I’m not a cool kid
[19:02:12] <mouseghost> brrr no boring answers lulu
[19:02:14] <ignaloidas> 4k is enough for simple python without pandas
[19:02:16] <Lulu> :-(
[19:02:40] <Lulu> But pandas has nice high-level routines for manipulating CSV.
[19:02:41] <ignaloidas> if you had like 1 million then pandas is considerable
[19:02:47] <companion_cube> sqlite maybe? :)
[19:02:49] <creature> Oh, yeah, SQLite has an "ingest CSV" mode. I've used that in the past too, when SQL is a good fit
[19:02:55] <indigo> SQL + python + jupyter
[19:03:02] <Ori_B> SPARK! (is totally overkill)

[22:25:07] <manicennui> "Introduces individuals owning microcomputers or minicomputers with minimal peripherals to the design and implementation of a threaded interpreter as an approach to developing a standard, nonstandard programming language"
[22:25:21] <manicennui> A standard, nonstandard programming language?
[22:25:43] <manicennui> From the reviews, it sounds like a book about writing a forth interpreter.
[22:25:53] <manicennui> In Z80 assembler.
[22:26:09] <companion_cube> waving imode in
[22:30:20] <shapr> I kinda want to give a lightning talk on using clock skew to fingerprint individual systems
[22:30:30] <Lulu> That sounds interesting actually.
[22:32:03] <shapr> it's pretty neat, you can figure out if it's the same system even if it's running a different OS and all the drives have been swapped out
[22:32:42] <riv> is clock skew common? and what if someone was running ntp would that stop it?
[22:32:45] <c355e3b> shapr: do you have any notes on this you can share?
[22:32:51] <shapr> from what I've read, that trick was used by some gov't organization to detect hidden Tor services on servers that ran both external and onion services.
[22:33:07] <c355e3b> riv: unfortunately yes

[22:33:29] <shapr> c355e3b: it's old stuff, but here's the first thing I found https://dsmilab.github.io/Yuh-Jye-Lee/assets/file/publications/conference_papers/C10_Clock_Skew.pdf
[22:33:48] <c355e3b> oh hmm
[22:34:04] <shapr> in short, the clock crystal in your system is uniquely imperfect
[22:34:27] <shapr> and you can use TCP packets to figure out that imperfect value
[22:34:28] <gerikson> it's meatspace
[22:34:34] <gerikson> aka the devil
[22:35:06] <shapr> step 2 is "hit the services on that system really hard and heat will slowly change the unique value"
[22:35:18] <technomancy> ntp helps but it can't prevent clock skew
[22:35:21] <shapr> yup
[22:35:41] <technomancy> cf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity
[22:35:42] <mockturtle> [ Relativity of simultaneity - Wikipedia ] - en.wikipedia.org
[22:36:51] <shapr> I think there was open source software that could remotely get the clock skew from a system
[22:38:51] <technomancy> an estimate of the clock skew, surely
[22:39:32] <shapr> yeah, imperfect like all things
[22:39:55] <imode> companion_cube: allo.
