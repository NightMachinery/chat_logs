[01:53:58] <disc> What i wonder is.. 
[01:54:26] *** Joins: keir (~keir@user/keir)
[01:54:26] <disc> Can i set something in znc to filter server notices to a client?
[01:54:49] <disc> For instance irccloud?
[01:55:22] <disc> Without having support from the ircd itself?
[01:55:51] <MetaNova> disc: I am reading the wiki entry, and
[01:55:54] <MetaNova> from the sound of it
[01:55:56] <MetaNova> no
[01:56:23] <disc> Dosent sound conclusive
[01:56:35] <MetaNova> since [[Snomask]] only filters messages based on which snomasks would generate the messages in question
[01:56:35] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Snomask
[01:57:05] <MetaNova> and your regular server notices, which are NOT the result of specific snomasks, seem to not be able to be targeted by this module
[01:58:18] <MetaNova> unprivileged users don't have any active snomasks
[01:58:41] <MetaNova> which means you can't use *snomasks to filter arbitrary server notices
[01:59:16] <disc> Well suppose you have o:line
[02:00:10] <disc> Is there a way to ignore server notices then?
[02:00:34] <disc> Since from what i can tell snomask needs to be ircd implemented
[02:00:39] <MetaNova> if you are an irc operator then the server messages which are generated by your specific snomasks would be ignorable
[02:00:45] <MetaNova> but again, not arbitrary ones
[02:00:52] <MetaNova> only the ones your snomasks generate

[02:01:56] <MetaNova> here's my modes and snomasks on another network: is using modes +Zanopswz +NWZbdfknrsux
[02:02:05] <MetaNova> the second group are my active snomasks

[02:03:43] <MetaNova> disc: what snomasks you can and cannot have is ircd dependent, yes.
[02:03:50] <Lord255> though any oper can remove whatever they want

[02:04:00] <MetaNova> Lord255: given appropriate privileges, yes
[02:05:24] <MetaNova> keir: while it might be handy, from time to time, I only know about it as I was once looking for the same functionality
[02:05:38] <MetaNova> I could have sworn clonenetwork existed at one point but I concluded I was imagining things
[02:06:30] <MetaNova> the most time consuming details about cloning a network would likely be what modules are loaded and which channels are joined
[02:06:58] <MetaNova> because, assuming defaults for things like flood controls, all that is really left is the network name and the server(s) for that network
[02:07:25] <MetaNova> besides, a user having two networks pointing to the same address(es) seems like a very uncommon thing
[02:07:37] <MetaNova> I'd imagine it would be near the bottom of the priority list for the developers
[02:07:45] <MetaNova> but, as they say, pull requests welcome

[02:09:16] <MetaNova> editing the conf by hand and mirroring whatever module directories are needed would likely be easier

[02:10:25] <MetaNova> of course there could be shortcuts, such as saving your channel list to a text file and just manually joining them en-masse later
[02:10:40] <MetaNova> it really depends on how much effort you want to put into it

[03:12:36] <disc> So if snomask isent implemented in the ircd, youre not able to set it in znc to filter to clients..?
[03:14:12] <disc> Do you know if theres a way to script ignore certain server notices? In for instance irccloud?
[03:14:45] <Lord255> i know for mirc. :) 
[03:14:47] <MetaNova> the *snomask module does not seem to be able to help you
[03:14:59] <Lord255> ircloud is a web based stuff ,right? :o
[03:15:11] <MetaNova> irccloud also has native mobile clients
[03:15:18] <Lord255> also why not remove the snomask you dont need?
[03:15:20] *** Joins: pj (~pj@ghettoforge/pj)
[03:15:37] <MetaNova> Lord255: they're latched onto "server notices" and "ignore"
[03:15:52] <MetaNova> and don't seem to comprehend that they, having no snomasks, cannot benefit from this module
[03:15:53] <Lord255> ask the admin (network one) to remove the snomask you wanna filter out. so you dont see them anyway.
[03:16:09] <pj> Is it possible to increase a timeout or something to make the connection between znc and Libera more robust?
[03:16:16] <MetaNova> pj: yes
[03:16:20] <MetaNova> let me find the variable
[03:16:25] <pj> thanks
[03:16:32] <Lord255> MetaNova, i dont care about znc's snomask module or whatever. if he wants to filter out snotices. he probably should think about not having em all
[03:16:58] <MetaNova> pj: /msg *controlpanel get NoTrafficTimeout $me
[03:16:59] <disc> Well thats my main issue here
[03:17:16] <MetaNova> pj: this will show the timeout configured for your user (applicable to all networks)
[03:17:21] <Lord255> disc, which is?
[03:17:21] <disc> Snomask was just an approach
[03:17:30] <pj> MetaNova: 180
[03:17:32] <MetaNova> to change this: /msg *controlpanel set NoTrafficTimeout $me 300
[03:17:35] <Lord255> what is your real problem
[03:17:50] <disc> My main issue is i want to ignore certain s notices
[03:18:03] <Lord255> cdertain means? all nick changes? all channel joins, etc?
[03:18:06] <Lord255> *-d
[03:18:11] <disc> No
[03:18:13] <pj> Thanks, how can I tell if a disconnection happened due to that timeout?
[03:18:24] <MetaNova> pj: 180 is the normal default. the network having roughly a 4 to 5 minute ping timeout configured means setting this to 300 will make the network kick you off, preventing ZNC from doing it prematurely
[03:18:41] <disc> Theres an open proxy scan that generates 10k klines a day
[03:18:43] <pj> MetaNova: cool, thanks
[03:18:48] <MetaNova> pj: *status should indicate something along the lines of "disconnected ping timeout" or such
[03:18:56] <MetaNova> np
[03:19:02] <disc> Which is sort of spamming my server console
[03:19:04] <Lord255> disc, understood. znc is not capable to do that. your client (which you use behind znc) should be capable to do that. (irccloud is not, i presume.)
[03:19:35] <disc> Well i havent figured out howto, atleast
[03:19:42] <disc> Feel free to help
[03:19:45] <MetaNova> disc: interesting
[03:20:13] <MetaNova> the only "open proxy scans" I see (not using irccloud, mind) is when the server tells me it is performing an open proxy scan when ZNC connects to the network
[03:20:20] <MetaNova> which happens only once, upon connect
[03:20:28] <Lord255> yea sure. i understood. though according what i know, its impossible to do with irccloud. :) - others may disagre
[03:20:31] <MetaNova> I question if your notice is server generated or irccloud generated
[03:20:40] <MetaNova> maybe a screenshot will help
[03:20:43] <disc> Well i see all the connects metanova
[03:20:56] <disc> Since i oper the network
[03:21:00] <MetaNova> oh
[03:21:04] <MetaNova> oh really
[03:21:06] <pj> Don't think I got that from status earlier, all I got was "disconnected from IRC" in the adminlog, and according to others I pinged out.
[03:21:23] <MetaNova> disc: if you are an ircop then you should have a snomask which controls that message
[03:21:54] <MetaNova> disc: in which case, you should be able to use *snomask to ignore that particular notice by specifying the snomask which controls that notice
[03:22:13] <MetaNova> the alternative is to simply disable that snomask
[03:22:40] <disc> And evert ircd has snomask?
[03:22:48] <MetaNova> pj: the *status messages are only displayed if you are attached at the time of the disconnect
[03:22:55] <disc> s/evert/every
[03:22:56] <ZNC-Linker> disc meant: “And every ircd has snomask?”
[03:22:56] <Lord255> this is what i said an hour ago. i just dont get this..
[03:22:58] <MetaNova> the adminlog isn't really verbose in that regard
[03:23:16] <MetaNova> disc: it's safe to declare that every ircd has snomasks, yes
[03:23:27] <Lord255> i just asked if he / you wants to ignore a specific type of snotice, or not.
[03:23:35] <pj> Is there a way I can get *status to log somewhere so I can review it if I'm not attached?
[03:23:41] <MetaNova> disc: do /whoami or /whois YourNick and you should be able to see what snomasks you have
[03:23:54] <Lord255> duh.. some supports channels give me a headache..
[03:24:08] <MetaNova> pj: the only way that is possible is to have a client attached, in order to observe/retain those messagers
[03:24:13] <MetaNova> messages*
[03:24:37] <pj> MetaNova: okay, I do normally leave it attached, so it shouldn't be an issue.
[03:24:42] <MetaNova> Lord255: I was under the impression they were not an ircop
[03:25:08] <MetaNova> so, my confusion was why they were trying to use anti-snomask functions when no snomasks exist
[03:25:16] <MetaNova> the fact that they oper the network changes everything

[03:28:01] <Lord255> that would remove a spec type of snomask. i already said he should ask the netadmin (main boss.. or whatever..) to remove snomask from oper block. 
[03:28:08] <Lord255> not sure if its his desire..
[03:28:16] <MetaNova> ^ this is the correct answer
[03:28:34] <MetaNova> either use *snomask to omit certain server notices based on specific snomasks for your mobile client, OR
[03:28:34] <disc> How do i find the correct snomaskletter
[03:28:44] <MetaNova> remove those snomasks from your user using /mode, OR
[03:28:57] <MetaNova> have the ircd conf reconfigured so that you are not granted that snomask to begin with
[03:29:05] <Lord255> the only thing iam not sure, if he dont wanna see a spec type of sheet, like filter out which snotice has a spec word in it.. or .. all of em'
[03:29:07] <MetaNova> disc: that depends on your ircd
[03:29:18] <Lord255> you know.. like mirc, haltdef or actually halt the sheetz

[03:42:20] <Lord255> if you wanna "filter" out stuff, you a decent client behind znc
[03:42:22] <Lord255>  thats it. :)
[03:42:38] <Lord255> *you need to use a decent *
[03:42:49] <MetaNova> https://charybdis.readthedocs.io/en/release-3.5/umodes.html#meanings-of-server-notice-masks
[03:42:49] <disc> I manage doing so using irssi
[03:43:06] <disc> Havent managed on irccloud
[03:43:34] <Lord255> cuz irccloud is for regular users, to have irc avail from any client.
[03:43:37] <Lord255> maybe thats why
[03:43:48] <MetaNova> in ratbox, if that particular notice is controlled by a specific snomask, then determining which snomask that is would allow use of *snomask
[03:44:58] <MetaNova> disc: here's a thought, can you clear the buffer in irccloud? I have a feeling maybe those 10,000 notices about open proxy scanning might be cached
[03:45:02] <MetaNova> and added to, and replayed
[03:45:04] <MetaNova> over and over
[03:45:08] <MetaNova> just a thought
[03:47:46] <disc> No they arent
[03:47:57] <disc> They are fresh
[03:48:06] <disc> Its traffic 
[03:49:42] <Lord255> https://pastebin.com/M8tHz5cq yay.
[03:50:02] <Lord255> hashtag-notirccloud
[03:52:01] <Lord255> anyway. i dont wanna guess how ratbox works. sry :)
[03:55:39] <disc> Again, as said
[03:56:02] <disc> I manage doing so in irssi, just not irccloud
[03:56:19] *** Quits: jmdaemon (~jmdaemon@user/jmdaemon) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[03:56:20] <disc> And it annoys the fuck out of me
[03:57:14] <disc> I wasent sure how snomask worked. And i got the impression the ircd didnt have to support it
[03:57:22] <MetaNova> well, irssi can ignore/filter by regex
[03:57:25] <MetaNova> irccloud cannot
[03:57:28] <disc> I guess i was mistaken
[03:58:28] <Lord255> yeah. decent ircd's have snomask "flags", like get a server notice when a user changes nick - that has a letter, etc.. so you could set it like /mode <nick> +s +n (if +n is the nick changes..)
[03:58:44] <Lord255> not sure how ratbox works, but its docu is garbage :\ :D
[03:59:40] <Lord255> just an example for a good docu: https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Snomasks
[04:00:36] <disc> http://www.efnet.org/?module=docs&doc=15
[04:00:37] <Lord255> with that you could control what you wanna see or not. if you wanna filter, the client is relevant. znc is just in the middle as a "proxy"
[04:00:55] <disc> There are the umodes you were looking for
[04:01:14] <Lord255>  umode         * +s     servnotice   - Can see generic server messages and oper kills
[04:01:19] <Lord255> found this in ratbox too..
[04:01:29] <Lord255> still no clue how you could ignore spec snotices. :D
[04:01:40] <disc> Exactly
[04:01:49] <disc> Back to square one
[04:02:01] <disc> Needs to be done in the client
[04:02:09] <Lord255> this is why i said: either go to ratbox and ask, or use a decent client. irccloud is not capable of filtering - as it seems :)
[04:02:11] <disc> And i probably cant
[04:02:19] <Lord255> yea:)
[04:02:33] * disc sobs
[04:02:38] <Lord255> :( sry:)
[04:02:48] <disc> Thanks for giving it a good run, atleast
[04:03:07] <disc> Im not giving up just yet
[04:04:02] <Lord255> well. np. :) (at least i learned not to use ratbox ever. :D)
[04:04:30] <Lord255> (not that i ever considered :D)

[21:44:43] <bookworm> you tell your client to connect twice to znc, once with a network id of A and once with B
[21:45:42] <bookworm> in the username field, $account/$network substitute the fields as appropriate
[21:46:21] <bookworm> you might also want to add a client identifier there if you have [[multiclient]] setup
[21:46:21] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/multiclient
[21:50:58] <jason123onirc> would it be account:password/network or account/network:password?

[22:18:34] <bookworm> you only need to put the account / network info into the password field of your IRC clients if it is a broken old one...
[22:18:58] <bookworm> every sane client has a proper username + server password field nowdays
[22:19:36] <MetaNova> has proper username + server password fields**
[22:20:03] <bookworm> yes indeed
[22:20:58] <bookworm> but it has A password field and A username field so the above might actually be valid English, if unusual
[22:21:55] <bookworm> (but yes it was a typo)
[22:24:37] <MetaNova> they're using a mobile client (Revolution, I CTCP'd them) so it wouldn't surprise me if they lack either a separate username field or a separate Server Password field (and merely have an unhelpfully labeled "password" field)
[22:25:23] <bookworm> no it has the two fields
[22:25:39] <bookworm> other issues, but lack of 2 input fields isn't one of them
[22:25:39] <MetaNova> annoyingly, and aggravatingly, mIRC as far as I know still to this day has two "Password:" fields and it's not immediately clear which one is strictly for NickServ auth and which one is for the Server Password
[22:27:01] <bookworm> hah, I was wrong
[22:27:23] <bookworm> it only has two fields if you have sasl active
