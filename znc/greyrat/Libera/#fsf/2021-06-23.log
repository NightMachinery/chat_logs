[08:31:33] <chronon> I guess it depends what type of editing work you are doing, but modern vim (once you've reached a certain point of skill) is massively more efficient than a simple editor like gedit. Indeed I find it faster than any IDE I've been forced to use. I'm sure emacs is similarly capable, I've just not used it.
[08:32:07] *** Joins: anjan (~anjan@node-1w7jr9qtrb7apkccopuzj8k14.ipv6.telus.net)
[08:34:13] <chronon> Of course, if you did not already have skill with vim, then there is a tradeoff to consider.
[08:35:08] <chronon> Is the kind of editing you will do going to benefit from the accelleration that vim offers. For plain prose, the answer is probably not enough to be worth learning vim.
[08:36:01] <chronon> But if it is coding in any kind of reasonable programming language, and you're going to be doing it professionally over the long term, then the answer is that it is definitely worth learning vim (or emacs, etc)
[08:37:07] <chronon> I think that any employer would wish to let their programmers use whatever editing tool they can be most efficient in, because after all it ends up in a git repo in the end.
[08:37:21] <chronon> One's choice of editor does not affect anyone else on the team.

[16:58:35] <chronon> Of course one can use a text editor to write large documents in a markup language that converts to ODF. Indeed that would be my personal preference, rather than by directly editing in WYSIWYG mode.

[21:49:14] <xx> what are the exact steps that FSF would like debian to make, in order to be an endorsed distro?
[21:51:14] <tpefreedom> This is just one person talking, but a good start might be fixing the problems laid out in https://www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.en.html
[21:51:18] *** Joins: OMYasuda (~OMYasuda@189.79.89.64)
[21:52:10] <psymin> I had no idea they endorsed distros at all, and that the list was so small https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html
[21:52:25] <xx> tpefreedom: I read that part, and it is not clear to me what *exactly* FSF would like debian to do
[21:52:30] <psymin> I wonder what would be necessary for gentoo to be listed
[21:52:54] <lightbringer> apparently the FSF wants distros to prevent users from installing proprietary software, except for certain pieces of OSPS like systemd
[21:53:28] <tpefreedom> lightbringer, is systemd nonfree?
[21:53:36] <lightbringer> it is
[21:53:48] <tpefreedom> also, they just don't want distros to provide those functionalities.
[21:53:53] <tpefreedom> 'In house'
[21:53:58] <lightbringer> according to https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html , "“Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community."
[21:54:04] <lightbringer> systemd is the opposite of that
[21:54:20] *** Quits: patrick (~patrick@fsf/member/patrick) (Quit: WeeChat 3.0.1)
[21:54:22] <lightbringer> it is part of an effort to force software on people that people don't want
[21:54:34] <tpefreedom> lightbringer, does it's license give users the 4 freedoms fsf considers the standard for free software?
[21:54:35] <lightbringer> also behavior
[21:54:40] *** Joins: patrick (~patrick@fsf/member/patrick)
[21:54:46] <psymin> xx, to answer the question I'd look at the differences between PureOS and Debian
[21:54:50] <lightbringer> tpefreedom: as you can see, the Free Software Definition is not about licenses
[21:55:09] <lightbringer> afaik Mono had a free software license too, yet it wasn't free software due to patent issues
[21:55:22] <tpefreedom> lightbringer, I'm simply talking about the criteria fsf/gnu use when deciding whether to endorse a distro.
[21:55:42] <lightbringer> i'm trying to derive the same criteria from their officially held positions
[21:56:32] <xx> psymin: that doesn't sound like something actionable. Has nobody produced a list of exact requirement they'd like debian to do in order to be endorsed?

[22:57:57] <tpefreedom> Maybe...
[22:58:33] <jxself> It would probably not be so straightforward, as some of the programs will likely require modification for FSDG purposes.
[22:59:10] <jxself> Unless you adopt a policy to just blacklist any program with FSDG problems rather than modifying them to fix it...

[23:29:35] <Gnuman> I thought the only thing debian had to do for endorsement was make it harder to install non-free software.
[23:30:23] <Gnuman> ...which to be honest, seems counter-intuitive. FSF endorses distros that don't respect the user's freedom to install non-free software. lol
[23:30:25] *** Quits: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:31:07] <tpefreedom> You are free to install nonfree software. The distro just won't provide in official repos.
[23:31:20] <xx> they are not in official repos
[23:31:31] <xx> debian always states that the non-free repos are not part of debian
[23:31:47] <tpefreedom> but debian manages those repos
[23:32:00] <xx> more like fastly.com manages those repos
[23:32:12] <tpefreedom> debian could always spin them off into projects run by different people.

[23:32:54] <Gnuman> yeah, afaik, the non-free repos aren't officially supported/endorsed by debian.
[23:32:57] <xx> that's what I'm looking for - actionable list of requirements from FSF to make debian an endorsed distro
[23:33:13] <xx> because right now it is not clear what *exactly* FSF wants debian to do

[23:33:18] *** Joins: penguino (~mrpenguin@user/mrpenguin)
[23:33:20] <Gnuman> but what I remember is that FSF requires that debian make it harder to install the non-free software, not just put it in a separate repo.
[23:33:31] <xx> e.g. from reading it, if the debian wiki were *deleted*, it would mean that debian could now be endorsed
[23:33:56] <Gnuman> Probably instead of debian having a checkmark to enable the non-free repo, you would have to copy+paste some text config from somewhere to enable it.
[23:34:13] <Gnuman> but that's just my guess
[23:34:29] <xx> exactly, everyone is just making guesses as to what would need to be done
[23:34:40] <Gnuman> xx, correct =)
[23:34:43] <Gnuman> maybe ask RMS?
[23:34:54] <xx> is RMS even active in online spaces anymore?
[23:35:05] <Gnuman> I think he still uses email and mailing lists
[23:35:24] <Gnuman> probably the best way to get an official answer is to email fsf directly
[23:35:42] <xx> does RMS/FSF actually reply to random emails from strangers?

[23:35:51] <Alicia> yes
[23:36:05] <Gnuman> xx, I mean, they keep telling people in IRC to email them, so they must be actively using email.
[23:36:12] *** Joins: penguino (~mrpenguin@user/mrpenguin)
[23:36:39] <xx> or the emails end up in /dev/null and so they don't need to deal with it :)
[23:36:42] <psymin> xx, yes, he does

[23:37:30] <xx> somehow I've become disillusioned (if that's the right word) with any company actually ever replying to an email from a nobody
[23:37:46] <xx> getting a twitter mob has a higher chance of getting a response
[23:37:58] <Alicia> good thing neither RMS or the FSF are companies :P
[23:38:17] <xx> in my view, FSF is a company

[23:38:33] <xx> RMS, hmm, he's a celebrity, and a celebrity is a kind of company
