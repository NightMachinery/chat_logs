[03:02:37] <noex> segmentation fault (core dumped)  neomutt <- is it just me or does neomutt dump core every other day?
[03:04:44] <swivel> just you from where i'm sitting
[03:05:03] <swivel> have you looked at a backtrace from the coredump and/or filed a bug?
[03:13:27] <noex> i haven't. there are so many issues I don't even know where to begin. i somehow got it to lock up and just keep beeping repeatedly. so that's interesting. and I still can't seem to, even with urlview installed, be able to consistently extract urls from emails.

[03:13:39] <noex> the fact that it core dumps every other day is the least of my concern at this point
[03:15:26] <noex> is it possible to cancel the "Please enter the key ID:" prompt without using Ctrl+C? 
[03:16:36] <immae> I have the same issue (segfault)
[03:16:43] <immae> do you happen to use imap?
[03:16:52] <noex> i do
[03:16:58] <immae> I have a hard time reproducing it so far, and I thought I was alone in this
[03:17:33] <immae> (also, I have 2 neomutts, one with a private imap works "fine" and one with the gmail imap segfaults regularly)
[03:17:42] <noex> yep, it's gmail imap
[03:17:46] <immae> ah
[03:17:51] <immae> probably linked then :D
[03:19:02] <immae> noex: In older age did you use to have issues with neomutt+gmail too where the connexion would get lost and you need to force-quit and restart it?
[03:19:16] <swivel> i only use a local maildir, but segfaults have been rare
[03:19:28] <immae> Now that you make the link it might be related
[03:20:25] <swivel> in the past flatcap has been quite responsive when i've found bugs and brought them to his attention, it's kind of on you if you're just living with crashes and not filing issues and at least looking at `bt full` for the coredump
[03:20:59] <immae> well I tried but it doesn’t fail when I want a full dump
[03:21:22] <immae> (and it’s painfully slow, so I cannot afford keeping it running until it crashes)
[03:21:23] <swivel> if you have the core file and it's not a stripped optimized build, you should already have it
[03:22:39] <immae> (I don’t)
[03:23:32] <bookworm> you sure? Systemd manages those nowdays
[03:23:53] <bookworm> meaning try coredumpctl or whatever its name is
[03:24:02] <immae> > Coredump entry has no core attached (neither internally in the journal nor externally on disk).
[03:24:28] <bookworm> I see
[03:24:36] <immae> I spent quite some time trying to reproduce it in old times, and that’s why I never complained: I had no way to get anything relevant so far
[03:24:45] <immae> And noex is the first one I see who has the same issue as me
[03:24:50] *** Quits: baloona (~baloona@mail.baloona.de) (Quit: WeeChat 2.3)
[03:25:40] <swivel> sometimes you need to be root core coredumpctl to find the core file, depending on how the distro is setup... in case you ran coredumpctl as your user
[03:25:50] <swivel> s/root core/root for/
[03:26:14] <immae> (nope, neither :p )
[03:26:19] <swivel> bummer
[03:29:31] <noex> oh yeah, i do have a core dump. i dumped it to file but it's binary. i've never messed with these before.
[03:30:22] <immae> Ah nice (don’t share it "raw" it might contain your gmail password)
[03:31:37] <immae> can you install gdb and run: gdb /path/to/neomutt /path/to/dump/file ?

[03:34:48] <noex> sure
[03:43:01] <swivel> today noex levels up
[03:48:15] <noex> lol
[03:48:26] <noex> right. this seems like valuable knowledge
[03:49:22] <noex> bt full looks largely useless. lots of question marks and "No symbol table info available"
[03:50:03] <swivel> that's unfortunate, did you build neomutt yourself from source?
[03:50:21] <noex> well, kind of. it's gentoo lol
[03:51:08] <swivel> well, at least you have a guide then :) https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Debugging_with_GDB
[03:52:44] <noex> nice :) yep, it looks exactly like the debug symbol stripped output
[03:57:19] <swivel> the best thing would be to repro the crash with a non-stripped build, it sounds like you experience crashes often so that might not be difficult

[03:59:50] <noex> okay that's what it looks like. basically i just need to reproduce it now. yeah, every other day it will typically happen at a completely random time. it's usually not even while actively using the program. it's strange.
