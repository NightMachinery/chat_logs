[01:35:04] <confuzeus> use any tree package of your choice.
[01:36:05] <velix> ;)
[01:37:28] <velix> okay, I've coded all the columns from string to integer.
[01:37:34] <velix> how shall N/A be masked? -1 ?
[01:38:45] <confuzeus> any particular reason why you coded the strings as integers? factors??
[01:39:44] <velix> confuzeus: Oh, I thought it's easier to work with intergers than with strings.
[01:40:00] <velix> Things like "gas" for heating is 1 now.
[01:40:08] <velix> "oil" is 2
[01:40:09] <velix> etc.
[01:41:13] <confuzeus> normally those should be coded as factors (unless of course the integers have some meaning), isn't it?
[01:42:24] <velix> okay. But what about N/A. I've got many of them but they could be important. Shall I just make -1 or 999 from them?
[01:42:45] <confuzeus> also, why do you want to mask NAs? i think you should decide how you would want to deal with them (e.g. exclude them, impute, ...)

[01:43:56] <velix> I can share the dataset if you're interested to have a look
[01:44:45] <confuzeus> no. it is your duty to understand your and make right decisions for your analyses
[01:44:59] <confuzeus> s/your/your data/
[01:46:07] <velix> It's not about letting you do my statistic analysis. Just to help me to understand what I'm talking about :)
[01:46:27] <velix> I think it's easier to use Excel for this and do some sorting.
[01:46:31] <velix> Thanks for help!
[01:47:00] <confuzeus> what is easier to use excel??
[01:48:24] <confuzeus> i think data management is way better done in R than excel
[01:48:59] <velix> I can sort the tables and columns and find rules for the classes manually
[01:49:02] <velix> only 16500 cases
[01:50:33] <confuzeus> that sounds like a recipe for disaster but you may have off the charts excel skills so could be doable. like manually implementing a decision tree in excel?
[01:51:16] <velix> exactly. like I normally do it. I just thought it would be easier in R. but no, it takes too long to get into. I just want a quick example.
[01:51:23] <velix> to check, if it's possible at all.
[01:54:51] <confuzeus> with persistence, anything is possible.
[01:55:53] <confuzeus> doesn't spss implement decision trees? you could start there...
[01:56:25] <confuzeus> that would be miles better than excel

[12:45:05] <Kabouik> I am trying to annotate with hardcoded text (highlighting a single plot feature), not plotting something that is in the data frame, so it's not relevant for all facets.

[13:00:05] <Kabouik> It's kind of ironic that annotate() is made for such arbitrary annotations but is not the best function to annotate a single facet

[19:24:29] <since_> Do you know good algorithms for percentile estimation on data streams (i.e. i can't store much data) where i already get good estimations during the stream?
[19:26:08] <since_> There are algorithms for e.g. median (FAME) where one steps right if the value is higher then the last guessed median, and left if the value is lower. Repeat this and adjust the step size to become smaller one ends up pretty much near the median
[19:27:08] <since_> But i am not sure that this gives good estimates during runtime because of the big oscillating step sizes in the beginning
[19:31:10] <since_>
