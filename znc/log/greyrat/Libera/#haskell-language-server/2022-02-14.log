[03:31:06] <Clinton> Hey all. I'm just using HaskellÂ  VSCode plugin 1.8.0 with HLS 1.6.1.0 underneath. When I use the "Find All References" it correctly only selected references with the exact name, but when I right click and click "Change All Occurrences" it doesn't just change references to that name but all names that have that name as a substring?
[03:31:06] <Clinton> Given the "Find All References" works correctly I figure I'm doing something wrong because HLS is clearly capable of finding, and hence presumably changing the correct set of references.
[06:56:25] <sooch_> I think "Change All Occurrences" is driven by VS Code. Last I checked the renaming plugin was not yet enabled.
[07:00:42] <sooch_> Just to confirm, yes that is a VS Code specific action and does the naive "find and replace". The rename action is done by the server, but it's not yet enabled.

[17:11:11] <maerwald> but it doesn't show up
[17:11:23] <maerwald> maybe have to do initialization first with the client etc?

[17:16:09] <fendor[m]> maerwald: no you don't
[17:16:21] <fendor[m]> I tried it, it definitely works without the initialisation
[17:16:22] <maerwald> I don't know why this doesn't work then
[17:18:38] <fendor[m]> maybe the id already taken?

[19:03:44] *** michaelpj[m] is now known as michaelpj
[20:21:53] <maerwald> fendor[m]: can you show me an example?
[20:22:36] <fendor[m]> example of how I did it? Unfortunately, I am afraid I force pushed my previous solution out of existence
[20:22:51] <fendor[m]> (moved to use lsp directly)
[20:24:00] <fendor[m]> I basically used the examples from the lsp-package and used its serialisation mechanisms
[20:36:27] <michaelpj> maybe we can expose some helpers from `lsp` to make this easier ðŸ¤”
[20:39:08] <michaelpj> maerwald: notifications don't have ids. Not sure if the client will throw it away because of that
[20:39:37] <maerwald> I'm also not entirely sure about the serialization of MessageType
[20:42:15] <michaelpj> looks fine to me
[20:43:12] <michaelpj> possibly insane suggestion to make this lsp-enabled wrapper stuff less bad: https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/2591#issuecomment-1039328574
[20:45:05] <maerwald> I think this can be solved with CPP as well
[20:45:43] <maerwald> both exe Modules just include a Common.hs with certain definitions set
[20:46:57] <michaelpj> well, "turning off all the feature flags" essentially boils down to a bunch of CPP
[20:47:14] <michaelpj> but the main thing is getting the LSP setup to not be a huge amount of duplication
[20:47:19] <maerwald> vscode doesn't print my message and vim shows this in logs: 18:16:46 ERROR reader-Some("haskell") src/rpcclient.rs:64 Thread reader-Some("haskell") exited with error: failed to fill whole buffer
[20:47:49] <michaelpj> maybe your content-length is wrong?
[20:48:10] <maerwald> content length is the bytecount of the json thing, no?
[20:48:19] <maerwald> I calculate it with `wc -c`
[20:48:44] <michaelpj> who knows
[20:50:21] <maerwald> ah, it's one byte too many, because of newline in echo ...
[20:51:41] <michaelpj> and this is why we get the library to do it for us :)
[20:52:34] <maerwald> very strict protocol
