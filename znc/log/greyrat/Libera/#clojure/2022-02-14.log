[00:21:00] <technomancy> how desperate would you have to be to take a gig at like ... oracle or palantir tho
[00:21:08] <technomancy> you really think those places hire folks who can't get a job elsewhere?
[00:21:38] *** Quits: yewscion (~yewscion@72-21-196-66.amazon.com) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[00:21:58] <seebs> Oracle certainly does, i've known decent people who applied there because they had skills relevant to a job doing something interesting.
[00:22:10] <seebs> Palantir... There's definitely people who have no problem with them.
[00:22:38] <technomancy> right but it seems really unlikely to be a kind of last-choice position
[00:25:50] <technomancy> you're not going to starve by turning down a job writing concentration camp software
[00:26:59] <seebs> you might!
[00:27:08] <seebs> sometimes you get really unlucky on job hunts
[00:27:18] <seebs> i knew a fairly competent and experienced dev who spent about 18 months looking for work a few years back
[00:27:25] <seebs> nothing specifically wrong with him, just bad timing and luck
[00:27:42] <technomancy> yeah, that's why I said really unlikely
[00:28:10] <tatsumaru> In WWII Germany you might have starved if not for the concentration camp jobs
[00:28:32] <technomancy> sure
[00:28:42] <seebs> i think people tend to massively overestimate how much their ethical and moral stances would outweigh what everyone in their community thought was normal
[00:28:54] <seebs> http://www.threepanelsoul.com/comic/good-ones
[00:29:40] <technomancy> seebs: yeah I'm specifically saying that this is going to affect my decision if I'm hiring people
[00:30:23] <tatsumaru> Decency is probably more important than even talent
[00:30:45] <technomancy> if there's a good reason for it I can listen but if I don't hear it I'm going to assume it's someone who cares more about money than anything else because that's much more likely.
[00:31:33] <Frozenlock> tatsumaru: They multiply. Don't get a zero in any of them :-p
[00:38:44] <tatsumaru> I am really wondering why ethical people find it so hard to organize and start their own compelling missions.
[00:39:09] <tatsumaru> At the end of the day blaming evil psychopaths can only get you so far.
[00:39:37] <technomancy> ethical people tend to not have a lot of money and power
[00:40:03] <technomancy> on account of, you know, the normal way that money and power are acquired
[00:42:50] <tatsumaru> Sure, but there should be a way to form a team that's not motivated primarily by money. In fact I think one of the best ways to figure out if employees really want to join your company for the vision is to offer less money and perks.
[00:43:50] <tatsumaru> I once took up a job that paid 3x less than what I usually make because I enjoyed the company's vision and so far this has been the most satisfying job I've ever had.
[00:44:11] <tatsumaru> I went to the office on Saturdays on my own will.
[00:44:14] <technomancy> in the US, survival is tied to a full-time job; in a country that had a humane health-care system people would have a much easier time organizing around ethical purposes
[00:44:23] <technomancy> which is a big part of why we don't have that in the US
[00:45:24] <cyberbanjo> tatsumaru why did you go to offices on saturdays
[00:46:04] <tatsumaru> cyberbanjo: just enjoyed the system we were building and went there to keep building on some saturdays
[00:46:36] <tatsumaru> technomancy: Yeah it's a vicious trap - also wasting so much time doing meaningless tasks robs you of your time to think

[01:02:13] <tatsumaru> hey guys what are the main differences between clojure and kawa?
[01:06:19] <TimMc> There have definitely been some times I've worked on a weekend or evening on a work project just because it was actually super fun and I was in the zone.
[01:06:44] <TimMc> but I then took some time off in the following days to match when I was less in the zone.
[01:08:27] <sobel> tatsumaru: i think you may have misunderstood the value proposition for nocode/locode platforms. they are most definitely aimed at developers. i admin one, for example, and it's brutally effective for me to knock out staff apps that hit my REST API or database
[01:09:05] <sobel> my nontechnical users cannot develop apps in it. it's not like that. it's aimed at someone with my experience who doesn't have a fulltime frontend dev.
[01:09:10] <tatsumaru> sobel: I doubt that, a lot of the marketing these apps have is targeted towards non-technical entrepreneurs
[01:09:33] <sobel> marketing lies don't change the facts on the ground, of who is using them and what skill level they design the tools for
[01:10:41] <sobel> you can go with firebase or supabase for the full turnkey experience, but if you already have a database and/or don't want to depend on a fully remote store these nocode tools hit the spot
[01:10:46] <tatsumaru> depends what you mean though, wordpress for example can be viewed as a sort of a no-code type of backend development. it certainly allows non-technical entrepreneurs to launch content projects without any php knowledge 
[01:11:54] <sobel> if the scope is blogs and blog-backed sites, then i could see wordpress as sort of a nocode platform. but that's a rather ugly and contrived example.
[01:12:16] <sobel> i am loathe to compare plugin-based ecosystems to nocode platforms
[01:12:48] <sobel> s/loathe/loath
[01:13:00] <tatsumaru> why would a developer need a nocode product?
[01:13:09] <sobel> i already told you that
[01:13:49] <tatsumaru> to generate front-ends for backend developers?
[01:14:02] <sobel> to make frontends for staff
[01:15:22] <technomancy> I read that as lolcode at first
[01:15:39] <sobel> technomancy: that is not far off, with some of the implementations i've done

[18:48:17] <sobel> yeik-the-spik[m]: that helps a lot to understand how text is pre-processed
[18:48:27] <sobel> for NLP ingestion
[18:58:58] <schmudde> Hello - I have a general question about `nil` style.
[18:59:30] <schmudde> (map #(if (even? %) %) [1 2 3 4]) of course gives me '(nil 2 nil 4)
[18:59:53] <schmudde> I can get rid of those with reduce - (reduce #(if (even? %2) (conj %1 %2) %1) [] [1 2 3 4]) 
[18:59:59] <schmudde> But it's a lot less attractive.
[19:00:06] <Para> Use `filter` :)
[19:00:27] <schmudde> I'm curious about the expense...
[19:00:41] <schmudde> map + filter vs. reduce + conj -- kind of the same?
[19:00:56] <Para> You don't need map for filter.
[19:01:06] <schmudde> oh just use filter.
[19:01:08] <schmudde> right 
[19:01:52] <Para> For deep performance exploration filter is transducer compatible, but maybe don't go that far into it yet. Core point is that filter does what you want and is really clean and simple to write and read.
[19:02:36] <schmudde> yeah - my example is a bit too simple probably. I can't actually use a predicate.
[19:03:30] *** Joins: Null_A (~null_a@2601:645:8700:2290:a4fb:481a:7fa9:b909)
[19:03:41] <Para> Any function returning a truthy value is a predicate, so you can always `filter #(your logic here) coll)`
[19:03:57] <schmudde> Every element in the collection is operated upon. Some return `nil` when the operation cannot be performed.
[19:06:14] <schmudde> For example, these return different results. (map #(some-> (even? %)) [1 2 3 4]) (filter #(some-> (even? %)) [1 2 3 4])
[19:06:57] <schmudde> The map returns the elements after they have been operated upon.
[19:07:19] <schmudde> So that is a map + filter, if I want to filter out the false values. 
[19:08:12] *** Quits: Null_A (~null_a@2601:645:8700:2290:a4fb:481a:7fa9:b909) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[19:11:57] <Para> The operation was done to each element, though.
[19:12:03] <ridcully_> map transforms each value; filter uses a predicate on the value and by that decides whether you want to keep it or not
[19:12:39] <ridcully_> the main difference between the "single step" reduce is, that the reduce would be eager - a map/filter chain is not in the first place
[19:13:28] <ridcully_> maybe `keep` helps with your usecase?
[19:15:27] <schmudde> ridcully_: ah yes - keep is the exact function I'm looking for.
[19:16:13] <schmudde> I forgot it would dump the nil values.
[19:16:16] <schmudde> Thanks!
[19:16:23] <schmudde> Sorry my original example confused the situation.

[19:51:19] *** Joins: kreved (~user@185.253.183.54)
[19:57:58] <Frozenlock> Indeed. However it makes the code a little less readable (IMO), so unless I need performance, I just keep using intermediate collections.
[19:59:25] <ridcully_> if you use the threading macro

[20:18:51] <sobel> Frozenlock: that's fair, and i would suggest that once you get into any repeatable habit of using transducers they get more readable
[20:19:15] <sobel> i might have spent a silly amount of time just getting my first one to work
[20:21:17] <sobel> there was a web tutorial that implemented a transducer with state and backpressure implemented but i can't find it anymore :(
[20:21:50] <sobel> oh right, it reassembled tweets from their API which streamed them in blocks that would break mid-tweet
[20:22:02] <sobel> so rightly that article is non-starter anymore
[20:22:26] <Frozenlock> Ah, the smell of the new web.
[20:22:55] <Frozenlock> We no longer link to forums or blog posts... but to twitter
[20:22:59] <jeaye> ridcully_: I'll check that link out. Thanks. Gonna ask that again now, since I asked it late last night.
[20:23:06] <jeaye> Anyone seen any good walkthroughs of clj's compiler/RT? I enjoyed this: https://www.duelinmarkers.com/2016/01/24/the-life-of-a-clojure-expression.html
[20:23:32] <sobel> saw, following in case there's a great ansnwer =)
[20:23:53] <Para> jeaye: I tried to find another presentation which was IMHO really nice but both google and youtube searches seem to be so trash these days that I couldn't find it.
[20:24:24] <jeaye> Para: Ah, you've seen one but lost track of it?
[20:25:05] <Frozenlock> Para: so it's not just me? Results are worse than before?
[20:27:44] <sobel> they started pushing the short-video model to compete with tiktok
[20:27:50] <sobel> it's bad
[20:28:13] <Para> jeaye: yeah, unfortunately
[20:28:20] <sobel> source: i am a former google fanboy, but current and long-time youtube premium subscriber
[20:28:38] <sobel> even with premium it's gotten way worse
[20:29:01] <Para> I restarted using bookmarks a lot more a few years ago when I noticed it was becoming impossible to find things I had seen before not even that long ago.
[20:33:28] <sobel> my bookmarks have suffered so much bitrot
[20:33:51] <sobel> apparently i'm good at picking ephemeral sources. i need a bookmark system that goes and mirrors things.
[20:34:26] <Para> I've been thinking that eventually if I ever get promoted to customer I will absolutely demand permalinking as a feature.
[20:34:35] <Para> Even so much so that it has to be guaranteed for decades.

[21:08:24] <TimMc> Para: I gave up on bookmarks. Now everything that's interesting and isn't a status website (weather, news, site status, etc.) goes into Zotero.
[21:10:08] <TimMc> Zotero is really intended for collecting and organizing research citations, but it works pretty well for this. Tagging, folders, metadata extraction, full text search.
[21:10:32] <jeaye> hm
[21:11:17] <TimMc> I've got a "high value" folder for things I know I'll want to refer back to or share later, and a "low value" folder for things where I *might* later wonder "now, where did I see that information..."

[23:14:19] <seebs> i'm slightly sick and have therefore become bored, entertain me with cool things to know about clojure. i guess a good random starting point: what's a good example of a task for which you would recommend *not* using clojure?
[23:14:56] <technomancy> window manager
[23:15:06] <ggb> Shell environment.
[23:15:29] <seebs> ... isn't there already a clojure wm
[23:15:32] <ggb> Specifically *as* shell. It'd probably be a great time to *write* a shell.
[23:15:42] <technomancy> seebs: haha wait what? hadn't heard of that
[23:15:54] <seebs> i might be wrong
[23:16:13] <ggb> I know of StumpWM as a WM in Common Lisp.
[23:16:54] <seebs> hmm. i have found one in haskell, and one in lua.
[23:17:06] <seebs> and there was a reference to fennel on a page talking about the lua one
[23:17:08] <seebs> i might be confused

[23:20:43] <Solid> technomancy: I'd be interestend in hearing your reasons for that
[23:21:40] <technomancy> Solid: WMs tend to rely on FFI which suuuuuucks on the JVM
[23:21:48] <technomancy> plus like ... what are you gaining?
[23:22:10] <ggb> Lazy seqs allow efficient management of infinite streams of windows!
[23:22:29] <technomancy> you don't want to wait around for the JIT to warm up
[23:22:43] <Solid> well, I suppose the gain is that one is able to use their favourite language for window management (that's at least why I got into xmonad in the first place :)
[23:22:56] <Solid> but the FFI is a good point, I didn't realise the JVM was bad at that
[23:23:15] <technomancy> you're not going to be able to make something in clojure that beats xmonad =)
[23:23:58] <Solid> phew :D
[23:26:00] *** Quits: seschwar (~seschwar@user/seschwar) (Quit: :wq)
[23:26:00] <seebs> My default assumption would be that a WM should have very little workload most of the time.

[23:26:23] <seebs> and theoretically, you should be able to do it without FFI by just implementing the X protocol. surely THAT wouldn't be hard
[23:26:28] <seebs> it's ONE LETTER
[23:26:40] <Solid> you want to re-implement xlib/xcb? Oo
[23:26:43] <Solid> well, good luck with that :D
[23:26:48] <technomancy> oh, it's absolutely possible
[23:26:52] <technomancy> you just have to *really* want it
[23:27:17] <technomancy> it's been done in elisp. but in elisp you get tremendous advantages, and in clojure you get basically nothing to show for it but slower boot time.

[23:34:29] <seabass> Hello! I was wondering if there was a way of a converting a data structure with nested sorted maps into ordinary Clojure maps - any ideas?
[23:34:56] <seebs> the artisinal solution is to hire skilled people to read the data structures and retype them
[23:35:26] <seebs> i think the first thing i'd ask is what you mean by convert. are you looking to flatten it, or do you just want to convert nested sorted maps into nested plain maps?
[23:35:49] <TimMc> There's some sort of like... clojure.walk or something namespace.
[23:35:57] <seabass> the latter - that the maps are sorted isn't useful, so it would be nicer to have them just associative
[23:37:09] <TimMc> Is it a *problem* that they're sorted?
[23:39:12] <technomancy> clojure.walk+into would be what I'd reach for
[23:40:42] *** Quits: kreved (~user@185.253.183.54) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[23:44:03] <seebs> my intuition is that if they're already sorted, unsorting them seems like a cost you don't need to pay
[23:44:20] <seebs> like, unless you're going to be using them heavily for a long time and the is-sorted imposes a cost
[23:44:35] <seebs> the cost of them staying sorted has to be pretty high to swamp the cost of making new copies that aren't sorted
[23:44:49] <technomancy> keeping them sorted makes every new insertion slower, I guess

[23:49:14] <seebs> yeah. if it's going to be getting modified, it may be worth it, but if they're just an already-created data structure and just being referenced, it seems unlikely to be worth the cost of a change.

[23:56:38] <seabass> I'll keep on using them as sorted then, for the time being :)
