[02:30:27] <Blondie101010> curious about the actual full file name
[02:32:53] <wald0> so in pool.d there's "site1.conf" file that user & group is site1, "listen" is /run/php/php-fpm-site1.sock , SAME configuration using site2 in another file site2.conf
[02:33:33] <Blondie101010> same socket?
[02:33:45] <wald0> i restart php-fpm, but only site1 socket is created, if i remove site1 file, then site2 socket is created (not both?)

[02:37:38] <wald0> Blondie101010, yes, the socket files are created and removed if i start/stop php-fpm, but again, only one of them
[02:38:14] <wald0> i just tried renaming one of the .conf files to a different name and this proof me that only one .conf file is used
[02:38:21] <wald0> seems like hte last one (alphabetical order)
[02:38:37] <Blondie101010> I asked for a listing
[02:38:59] <Blondie101010> hold on
[02:39:08] <Blondie101010> what name works or doesn't?
[02:39:20] <Blondie101010> that could be an inaccurate include directive
[02:39:55] <wald0> php-fpm.conf file includes this line, which is meant to work... include=/etc/php/8.0/fpm/pool.d/*.conf
[02:40:02] <Blondie101010> but not if it's the last one with a different name
[02:40:28] <Blondie101010> it does in my experience follow no reliable order
[02:40:58] <wald0> i assume php-fpm should start a different pool per each .conf file on this dir, but seems like is not
[02:41:00] <Blondie101010> so your 2 config files are probably conflicting or doing the same thing
[02:41:04] <Blondie101010> show both of them
[02:43:23] <Blondie101010> the php-fpm log probably tells you exactly what is wrong
[02:44:23] <wald0> Blondie101010, only the options:  https://pastebin.com/tnhSthkD
[02:44:57] <wald0> nothing in the logs, it only says 3 lines like "started, listening... something"
[02:48:15] <Blondie101010> did you try changing the name?
[02:48:31] <Blondie101010> in 2, change "[www]" to "[somethingelse]"

[02:49:04] <wald0> ooh!

[03:00:39] <wald0> this can be a little off-topic, but im installing wordpress sites, it is better if i add the server's IP with the website name on /etc/hosts? (like x.x.x.x mysite.com)

[03:25:54] <__adrian> i don't know what you mean by "locally on the server"

[03:35:41] <__adrian> here's  a few questions to try to clarify
[03:35:47] <Blondie101010> the server doesn't need to know how the clients reach it
[03:35:53] <__adrian> are you talking about the hosts file _on your local computer_?
[03:36:27] <wald0> no, not my computer, im only talking about the server machine
[03:36:31] <__adrian> ok
[03:36:37] <wald0> so the server machine where i installed wordpress
[03:36:43] <__adrian> **why** do you want to do anything with the hosts file on your server?
[03:36:46] <Blondie101010> sure, so what I was talking about
[03:37:21] <wald0> __adrian, for when something (anything) is trying to fetch mywebsite.com, will directly go to its known ip instead of do a dns call
[03:37:26] <Blondie101010> wald0:  your server's hosts file is meant to tell it exceptions on things it needs to access
[03:37:30] <__adrian> wald0: that's not how dns works
[03:37:38] <__adrian> *do not change* your server's hosts file.
[03:38:07] <__adrian> a system's hosts file is for _the local system_. it has nothing to do with other computers.
[03:38:10] <Blondie101010> DNS is not affected by /etc/hosts and clients don't see that
[03:38:56] <wald0> yeah not clients, im talking about the server itself funcionality, sometimes it needs to call it himself, let's say for example a curl command to verify that the site is running correctly
[03:39:09] <Blondie101010> why does it call itself?
[03:39:22] <Blondie101010> WordPress does no such thing for sure
[03:39:25] <__adrian> something like that would not run on the same machine (if the machine is broken, how would you trust it to check on itself?)
[03:39:50] <__adrian> if your server is making http requests to itself, you should stop and think about why
[03:40:36] <__adrian> aside from that, if you're _not using dns_ to check on your site's health, then you're missing a huge chunk of possible problems  ;)

[03:50:58] <wald0> hum, makes sense
[03:51:31] <wald0> so in the end, is not a good practice to add any type of entry in my /etc/hosts file for like blog.mysite.com ? (not even localhost?)
[03:52:17] <__adrian> it's simply not necessary
[03:52:31] <__adrian> unless you have some fairly special use case (which you would know about)
[03:57:49] <wald0> yeah thats the point, i think i needed to set that in the past but i dont remember why... i dont remember if because of an improvement, or security, or some hack
[03:58:28] <noord> wald0: /etc/hostname ?
[03:59:02] <wald0> nah, that one is fine, its "myhoster1"
[04:03:13] <__adrian> "i dont remember if because of an improvement, or security, or some hack"  my point is, for a typical setup, none of that is likely to be true.
[04:04:16] <__adrian> you would need to be doing something pretty out-of-the-ordinary for it to be useful/make sense. you'd _know_ that you had to, and why. if you don't know, you don't have to.
[04:10:43] <noord> wald0: once we were too lazy to setup in company dev servers. Everything is going through /etc/hosts and ips, it is legit but not recommended way, it will likely to bite you later
[04:11:36] <__adrian> i'm not even clear (i don't think so) that we're talking about dev envs here at all. sounds like a production website.
[04:14:27] <noord> __adrian: It was a real life case not using dns server
[04:21:54] <wald0> mmh yeah

[05:18:12] <jadew> hey guys, I'm testing out psalm and I'm wondering if it should error out when assigning the wrong type value to the element of a typed array - it doesn't seem to do that for me
[05:27:25] <Blondie101010> can you show your typed array definition?
[05:28:28] <jadew> I tried this: /** @var array{test: string, b: string} */
[05:28:34] <jadew> and this: /** @var list<int> */
[05:29:12] <jadew> for the first one doing $a['test'] = 1; doesn't issue an error
[05:29:30] <jadew> for the second one $a[] = 'abcd'; also doesn't issue an error
[05:30:36] <jadew> I'm probably missing something, but I don't know what it is

[05:31:53] <__adrian> might be a configuration issue. or "Unlike property types, however, assignment typehints are not binding – they can be overridden by a new assignment without Psalm emitting an issue"  might have something to do with it.
[05:31:57] <__adrian> https://psalm.dev/docs/annotating_code/typing_in_psalm/
[05:33:20] <jadew> __adrian, that's interesting, but I'm not reassigning them after the type hint
[05:33:27] <__adrian> i don't use psalm personally but i know some people here do. psalm does have https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/discussions
[05:33:39] <jadew> thanks
[05:34:52] <jadew> this is the code: https://pastebin.com/Ptacus0f
[05:36:34] <jadew> hmm... if insert a psalm-trace on line 3, I get the expected type for $a
[05:37:19] <jadew> I guess at this point I'm just asking if this functionality works for other people or not
[05:42:56] <__adrian> "jadew> I'm not reassigning them after the type hint"  your pastebin shows that you do reassign $a["test"]
[05:43:15] <__adrian> $a = ['test' => 'abc',  // this meets the typehint so would not error
[05:43:34] <__adrian> $a['test'] = 1;  // this is a reassignment, which docs say isn't checked
[05:44:17] <__adrian> similar story for $ax
[05:44:31] <jadew> __adrian, that's not a reassignment of $a tho
[05:44:42] <jadew> it's a reassignment of what it contains, which should be checked, but it isn't
[05:44:49] <jadew> (0 errors or problems found)
[05:45:12] <__adrian> i don't see anything that says it "should be checked" - and that's not how i'd interpret that passage in the docs
[05:46:17] <jadew> what would be the point of typing the array if it's not checked?
[05:47:57] <__adrian> docs imply that assignment hints are one-offs. "Unlike property types, however, assignment typehints are not binding"
[05:48:20] <jadew> that makes sense, but I'm not assigning $a again
[05:48:29] <__adrian> i.e., they check the assignment that follows, and nothing more.
[05:48:48] <jadew> ah, I see what you mean
[05:48:50] <__adrian> "not binding" implies that the hint does not follow the variable around on subsequent steps.
[05:49:11] <jadew> ok, that is definitely not true then, because it works for other stuff
[05:49:34] <__adrian> (and tbh, "i'm not reassigning" isn't a convincing argument/distinction imm ;)
[05:49:40] <__adrian> k
[05:49:52] <__adrian> well, like i said, i don't use it - just reading the docs.
[05:50:24] <jadew> yeah, I was hoping for a confirmation from someone who does that this works or doesn't work, just so I know if I need to look further into it
[05:51:19] <__adrian> you've seen the distinction between "property type" and "assignment types"? the former _would_ follow the property through subsequent analysis.
[05:53:27] <jadew> I haven't but I would have expected it to work like that anyway
[05:54:18] <jadew> in the case of assignment type hints, I tested other stuff prior to this and it "follows"
[05:55:07] <jadew> I understand why it cannot be binding, but that should only apply in the case of a reassignment

[13:46:20] <krux02> hello humans, I am new to php and I am just getting started. Somehow I got around never using php for now almost 20 years of programming experience.
[13:49:38] <krux02> Maybe you can point me to a few resources to get the basics working like static code analysis to detect typos in variables early.
[13:51:20] <TinoDidriksen> If you use strict_types enabled and have error_reporting = -1, then that'll catch most such issues.
[13:57:38] <AllenJB> There's a number of static analysis tools. The "main" ones are CodeSniffer, PHPStan, Psalm and Phan. They all have different rules and strengths - it's not uncommon for projects to use multiple analyzers.
[13:57:39] <AllenJB> Most can be configured with a wide range of 3rd party extensions for additional rules. Try them all and see which you like.
[13:58:30] <AllenJB> The other way to catch errors early is to write tests - phpunit is the most popular test framework, but there are others too.

[14:30:55] <krux02> TinoDidriksen, `error_reporting` is just for runtime errors, is it?
[14:31:30] <TinoDidriksen> It also shows you warnings for using variables that haven't previously been set, which catches most typos.

[14:48:38] <krux02> TinoDidriksen, how do I ge those errors on the command line?
[14:49:14] <Naktibalda> yes, these error are only reported at runtime, so you must execute that code
[14:49:27] <krux02> :-/
[14:49:29] <Naktibalda> what a shitty pastebin though, it is impossible to copy code from it
[14:49:36] <krux02> sorry
[14:49:46] <krux02> you can strip the /php
[14:49:50] <krux02> then you can copy
[14:49:57] <Naktibalda> the problem is line numbers
[14:50:21] <krux02> yes they disappear when you strip the /php
[14:50:25] <TinoDidriksen> https://3v4l.org/a5oqa - it happily reports "Undefined variable $f"

[14:53:01] <TinoDidriksen> php -S doesn't compile anything.
[14:53:10] <TinoDidriksen> You have to load the page in the browser.
[14:53:42] <krux02> yea, how do I get the errors on the command line before opening a browser on localhost:8080?
[14:53:43] <TinoDidriksen> Or run it with just php, no -S
[14:54:44] <krux02> ok, but that executes the code and i get a stack trace
[14:55:00] <TinoDidriksen> Yes, executing is the only built-in way to catch these things.
[14:55:49] <Naktibalda> phpstan would pick it up, I think
[14:56:01] <krux02> yea it does
[14:56:04] <krux02> I tried it
[14:56:12] <krux02> but phpstan seems to be quite slow

[15:00:26] <krux02> Does it compile script to bytecode similar to python and then stores them in a cache?
[15:00:47] <TinoDidriksen> There is an optional bytecode cache and now an optional JIT.

[15:02:41] <krux02> It seems weird to have this language with C++ syntax that is just interpreted.
[15:03:18] <TinoDidriksen> Lots of languages have C family syntax. JS does as well.
[15:03:31] <CoJaBo> I've seen straight-up C interpreters (of varying degrees of "compliance") before lol
[15:03:48] <krux02> yea I know, but php explicitly has C++ syntax
[15:03:56] <TinoDidriksen> No, PHP does not have C++ syntax.
[15:03:57] <krux02> the :: for namespace and the -> for membors
[15:04:15] <TinoDidriksen> \ for namespaces.
[15:04:16] <krux02> I haven't seen that outside of php yet
[15:04:37] <CoJaBo> It's got semicolons! It's what programmers crave.
[15:04:37] <krux02> then where did I see the ::, do I have false memory?
[15:04:52] <TinoDidriksen> :: is scope resolution for classes, which yes is the same in C++
[15:05:14] <CoJaBo> PHP has a fancier name for it tho (at least in older versions)
[15:05:34] <krux02> I don't really care too much about semicolons or syntax in general. But I do care about having static analysis tools to detect bugs and problems ahead of time.
[15:06:18] <krux02> python, javascript and php where never interesting languages for me personally to learn, but now I do it for the money
[15:06:43] <krux02> CoJaBo, what's the php name for it?
[15:06:50] <CoJaBo> krux02: T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM
[15:07:22] <krux02> interesting name
[15:07:36] <krux02> I call it the quadro dot
[15:07:57] <CoJaBo> Hebrew, apparently
[15:08:21] <krux02> I don't speak hebrew
[15:08:30] <krux02> but I think I heared about it.
[15:08:46] <krux02> Somebody at university told me about it, and about the increment operator on strings.
[15:09:10] <CoJaBo> PHP has a ton of weird gotchas all over. But then again, so does JS
[15:10:02] <krux02> Not sure if PHP can beat C++ in weird gotchas.
[15:10:12] <CoJaBo> My favorite one as of late is that comparing strings and numbers is broken in a different, and incompatible, way in 8.0 vs. previous versions.
[15:10:24] <krux02> C++ doesn't have weird gotchas, it has open invisible knives everywhere.
[15:10:39] <CoJaBo> The sane thing to do would be to make that at least a warning, but nope. Just invisible knives stabbing your compares in the back.
[15:10:55] <krux02> comparing string and number should be an error
[15:11:03] <krux02> not some weird behavior
[15:11:17] <CoJaBo> Not just weird, but weird and inconsistent! =D
[15:11:26] <CoJaBo> Does one thing in 7, opposite in 8 <_<
[15:11:40] <CoJaBo> Here's hope they fix it in 9 lol
[15:11:43] <TinoDidriksen> PHP definitely has C++ beat in terms of weirdness-per-LOC.
[15:12:10] <krux02> well then I am about to have an exciting future
[15:13:14] <CoJaBo> My other recent favorite is the DS extension, which has a polyfill that doesn't correctly implement most of its methods. Took me HOURS to track that one down rofl

[16:56:00] <hans_> does $_POST support any Content-Encoding?  like Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Encoding: gzip
[16:58:56] <AllenJB> I would expect PHP to handle gzipped content, yes. And it definitely supports both urlencoded and multipart content.
[17:00:01] *** Quits: luigibu (~luigi@80.30.201.209) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[17:00:10] <stenno> kinda expected the unpacking to be done by the webserver alread
[17:00:11] <stenno> y
[17:00:24] <hans_> it doesn't tho.. printf 'foo=bar' | gzip -9 | curl --data-binary @- http://ratma.net/dumpinput.php --header "Content-Encoding: gzip"
[17:00:58] <hans_> like if you leave out the actual gzip -9 , php just pretends the Content-Encoding didn't exist, and
[17:01:06] <hans_> actually seems php completely ignores the Content-Encoding header?
[17:01:38] <stenno> needs Content-Type header too
[17:02:23] <hans_> curl adds that automatically, when there is a body but no content-type header has been specified, curl automatically adds `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` , i think that's how it goes
[17:02:33] *** Joins: luigibu (~luigi@80.30.201.209)
[17:02:52] <hans_> yup, > Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
[17:03:29] <stenno> there is https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.gzdecode.php
[17:04:25] <hans_> so you can add manual support by doing parse_str(gzdecode(file_get_contents("php://input")), $_POST);
[17:04:38] <hans_> mhm
[17:04:47] <hans_> err wait, no you cant
[17:04:58] <stenno> whats your webserver?
[17:05:13] <hans_> if its a content-type supported by $_POST thingy, php://input will be empty even when it shouldn't, iirc
[17:05:42] <hans_> its a 7.3.25 php-fpm behing a nginx thingy
[17:05:58] <stenno> maybe ask nginx to automatically decompress gzip
[17:06:04] <hans_> fairly standard debian `sudo apt install nginx php-fpm` thingy
[17:06:43] <stenno> i think compression and decompression is usually the task of the webserver

[23:51:51] <PenguinMan98> Hey guys. I have an app that has a server/client and they connect via websockets with a mysql behind it. The server side app works just peachy as does the client side app, but the client side app with each page load, logs tens of errors of the form `FT ERROR: Connection error (MYSQL): [#2006] MySQL server has gone away`
[23:52:47] *** Joins: kuhilas (~kuhilas@2001:470:69fc:105::3040)
[23:52:56] <PenguinMan98> As I said, the client DOES work, so it's only a nuisance as far as development goes
[23:53:30] <PenguinMan98> And yet, there has to be some kind of simple correctable reason for it.
[23:53:58] <PenguinMan98> Has anybody seen anything like this?
[23:54:23] <PenguinMan98> ( I did google first and found some stack overflows, etc.)
[23:57:43] <Albright> PenguinMan98: This happens when your MySQL server crashes after you send it a query.
[23:58:07] <Albright> I've sometimes had this happen when trying to do complex queries with windows or weird joins or stuff.
[23:58:14] <__adrian> or if you've made a connection but it fails/times out before you actually use it
[23:58:53] <__adrian> e.g., if you have a long running process that connects, does something, leave idle for a time, then tries to do another thing
[23:59:11] <Albright> If you can isolate which queries are triggering the crash (if that indeed is what's happening) you might be able to rewrite the query in such a way that the server tolerates it more. Upgrading the server daemon may also help.
[23:59:38] <__adrian> you can also check if it's a simple matter of reconnecting
