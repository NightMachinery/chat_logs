[00:06:34] <JollyRgrs> ok, got a domain coming up for renewal... using cloudflare for NS, but registered with namecheap long ago... CF is trying to offer great benefits (ok, just cheaper prices). Anyone got pros/cons for going to CloudFlare for registrar?

[07:54:58] <signalblue> i'm not joking
[07:56:33] <gibby> Well...
[07:56:45] <gibby> do you own a .cf domain? 
[07:56:59] <signalblue> why?
[07:57:11] <signalblue> where is this going
[07:58:11] <signalblue> because "own" is a pretty strong term
[07:58:23] <gibby> because it would be trivial for anyone from Microsoft to see the IP address you just connected from, to a public IRC channel, see the domain associated with the same address, look up who you are and where you work, because you're asking if pirating an operating system is ok.
[07:58:52] <signalblue> never said we pirated anything
[07:59:17] <gibby> you implied it.
[07:59:28] <signalblue> yes i did
[07:59:43] <signalblue> but now I am explicitly denying that

[10:01:34] <yuken> yar riff-IRC 
[10:01:41] <yuken> I guess I could heat up the pin and melt the plastic around it, to ream it open.
[10:02:02] * riff-IRC nods
[10:02:59] <riff-IRC> that system was run 24/7 from 2004 until November 2018 when I officially pulled it from service due to general instability problems and a flaky SATA controller, which later died completely
[10:03:14] <riff-IRC> not to mention a bad PSU
[10:04:08] <riff-IRC> the bad PSU is what triggered the service call against it, and later testing revealed the general instability problems and flaky SATA controller
[10:04:52] <riff-IRC> so I made the decision to pull it from service, image the HDD, clean the 93,000 tons of dust out of it, and shelve it indefinitely
[10:06:54] <riff-IRC> December 2019, I needed a system to act as a bridge between a wired LAN and a wireless network, so it came out of retirement. installed a known good PSU and a 40GB IDE HDD, installed Ubuntu Server on it, and it stayed in service until April 2020
[10:08:20] <riff-IRC> April 2020, more network configuration changes happened and that system was retired once again, save for about a week when I used it to image the contents of several hundred floppy diskettes.
[10:09:01] <riff-IRC> Need to copy them off of a spare Maxtor drive I've got floating around.
[10:10:52] <riff-IRC> January 2021, I pulled it out of retirement and turned it into a firewall system. It also got a motherboard recap, which improved stability.
[10:11:01] <riff-IRC> Been in 24/7 service ever since then.

[13:33:01] <nobyk> can you ping the rpi wg interface from the vps wg interface? (with both their interfaces on)
[13:33:36] <nobyk> If that doesn't work, try tcpdump and see what's going on on both ends, if they are/aren't receiving

[13:37:44] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> now it doesn't even connected anymore. the local Pi says sent for 2.75kb but 0B received. Ping does not go through.
[13:37:44] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> the server doesn't show the connection as established at all anymore..
[13:38:58] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> also am I right in assuming those `PostUp` and `PostDown` entries in the config are an unsupported hack?

[13:41:23] <nobyk> I have PostUp and PostDown scripts
[13:41:39] <nobyk> also I don't think wireguard really 'connects'
[13:42:06] <nobyk> but yeah try tcpdump
[13:42:28] <nobyk> it helped me a lot, to understand better what isn't working and that helped me look in the right direction to solve whatever it was
[13:42:48] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> what would that help? isn't that to look into packages? the problem seems to be routing so wouldn't traceroute be better?

[14:02:08] <nobyk> I highly suggest you fix your basic wireguard connectivity before you try and route other traffic over it
[14:02:23] <nobyk> so yes, use tcpdump to try and figure out why your wireguard interfaces can't ping eachother
[14:03:09] <nobyk> Because the routing is kinda something you build on top of your wireguard vpn network, hence you want that to be stable first
[14:07:12] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> tried tcpdump didn't give any useful info. I'm just using tailscale now. this isn't worth the trouble. I might come back to wireguard once there is usable documentation on it. tailscale builds on top of it and makes it usable.
