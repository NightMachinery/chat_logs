And then he can come back later and go into the public building and reach everywhere as long as it's a public

[02:51:59] <juliaEnv> example: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-examples/tree/main/rest/security in this Spring Data REST project (the project is named security), there are Spring Data REST and Spring Security. Once you add an Item to Employee, i.e. class Employee { @OneToOne private Item item; ... } and try to post it via CURL, i.e. POST ... { "firstname": "Johnny", "item": {"description": "sample description" } } } then 
[02:51:59] <juliaEnv> your @RestController will only recieve firstname=Johnny and item=null. Only when you switch off Security, i.e. by commenting out @EnableWebSecurity, you'll get firstname=Johnny item={description=sample description}

[02:52:11] <juliaEnv> what is it that Spring Security might be doing that it deletes the value of all subentities (uses null)?
[02:53:49] <macaw> Good question. I had been wondering about it myself in the past. Haven't seen it. The cynic in me says "That stuff only happens on small projects, in small teams.", but he's a cranky curmudgeon.

[02:58:20] <quazimodo> we have a web app where admin may want to define some behaviour, i definitely am not going to let them write code & use `eval` or whatever, but a purpose built sandboxed scripting language that runs in containers could work

[03:03:37] <noircode> you have to sandbox lua yourself, but yea
[03:04:11] <noircode> there is also guile scheme
[03:04:16] <quazimodo> juliaEnv: in this case a pricing engine. Ideally the textual block of code doesn't import any deps, receives all it's data via arguments & can do maths, then return a value

[05:54:29] <flaknet99> nah its just like java

[06:23:22] <CoderGuy> hi
[06:23:25] <Guest82> otherwise diff doesn't output anything
[06:23:28] <Decker> right - so far the only one that does is the one in your editor
[06:24:02] <CoderGuy> people argue you should put interfaces inside the same folder as their classes, but I think interfaces belong in their own folder called "interface" what's proper and why?
[06:24:02] <Decker> ahh - maybe... you might have a stray \r in there?  git should always be configured to not change line endings
[06:24:11] <Decker> that was such a stupid idea that they added that

[06:26:32] <InPhase> CoderGuy: Why would you put interfaces into a separate folder?
[06:26:55] <InPhase> CoderGuy: You typically edit both at once, so why would you want to jump around so much?
[06:27:05] <CoderGuy> InPhase, because interfaces are interchangeable, and they don't belong to just one class they belong to all kinds of classes
[06:27:12] <Guest82> upon closer inspection the first one has an extra byte
[06:28:23] <InPhase> CoderGuy: What fraction of your interfaces in your code have only a single class implementing them?  Also, what fraction have the same base name for the interface file and the class?
[06:28:24] <CoderGuy> for example lets say I have a Car interface, but then I have multiple car types, BMW, Ford, Honda, the different car types are going to be in their own folder, but each of them have to reference the Car interface
[06:29:50] <CoderGuy> to go further lets say I have airplanes as well, different types of vehicles, but they all reference a specific interface, now I do have a folder called Vehicles, and I could put the interfaces in there...but the problem is to me it would seem these go into their own interface location
[06:29:56] <InPhase> CoderGuy: Subject organization tends to be better.  Like, a "car_stuff" folder.

[10:17:53] <arahael> Archival formats, naturally - especially those that don't compress, such as .tar
[10:18:13] <beaky> nice i like tar it's like a serailized file system
[10:18:59] <novns> except it's not a file system, no random access for example
[10:19:27] <novns> tar is a "tape archive"
[10:20:04] <mercenary> tapes can seek too. It's just that the latency is a bit high

[10:20:42] <novns> mercenary, no random access means you have to read the archive until you meet a needed file
[10:20:55] <novns> you don't know where it's located

[10:21:38] <novns> and if the file is at the very end, you have to parse the whole 100500TB file
[10:22:37] <mercenary> novns: iff you have a seek operation on the medium, you can skip anything between headers
[10:23:42] <novns> mercenary, but you have to read all the headers anyway
[10:23:50] <novns> all 100500 of them
[10:25:19] <mercenary> same goes for filesystems, you have to read all the i-nodes from the root down until you get to the file
[10:25:36] <mercenary> with tapes, that just goes a bit slower
[10:25:49] <novns> mercenary, no, you don't need to read all inodes, they are arranged in trees
[10:26:09] *** Quits: jazz-o-lantern (~jaziz@172.58.28.108) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[10:26:10] <novns> so it's very fast to read inodes of a file system
[10:26:12] <Decker> which you can have a tree index stored in the tape too - then just read the header index 
[10:26:25] <novns> Decker, but there are no trees in tar format
[10:26:38] <Decker> sure until you read it the first time and make one :)
[10:26:58] <arahael> Can someone recommend a program that can go through photos in a particular directory structure, and basically categorize them by person? (Ie, facial recognition)
[10:27:09] <Decker> it doesn't HAVE to be that way - but yes - tape serlialized things are more IO than CPU
[10:28:11] <novns> Decker, but if something was added to a tar file, you have to rescan it again
[10:28:49] <novns> because there could be new files with the same path
[10:28:58] <novns> and it means files were changed

[10:38:02] <Decker> nonvs past few years I've tinked file filesystems - so I do have this one that's just a list of blocks that append only but then tracks where stuff is within that file; but certainly would be murder on a real tape drive; since it's seek-read and seek-write; but even then things that used tapes didn't have the memory to keep a cache of everything...it already maintains a cache of changes before flushing them to the disk; allowing the 
[10:38:03] <Decker> program basically 100% memory access speed to storage (other than waiting if a block has to be loaded), but then writes are delayed; but they could be serialized to not random seek so much (sorry I'm just rambling :)
[10:38:19] <Decker> and I wouldn't use 'tarfs' but rather the library I already have maybe with FUSE

[10:56:39] <Decker> I dunno looks like it's an error - scanf for C has similar behaviors
[10:57:03] <Decker> (error in the stream input) either you need to clear cin (flush/rewind)
[10:57:15] <Decker> or re-read the cin into a string that won't fail
[10:57:29] <Decker> and then the next time it will be in a empty state and wait for input

[17:53:41] <phuzzy> i invented a time machine. gonna use it to go back in time 25 years til when irc was still the shit
[17:53:58] <pulse> can i come too
[17:54:06] <dimino> basic JS question: my intuition tells me storing data as a string is less efficient than storing it as an object, is that right?
[17:54:10] <phuzzy> im bringing everyone!
[17:54:18] <dimino> like "key:value" vs {key: "value"}
[17:54:37] <dimino> I feel like the object can be better optimized by the js engine but I have no evidence for that
[17:54:49] <pulse> dimino, yes in the sense that it's far easier to access an object, thereby making it implicitly more efficient
[17:54:58] <pulse> other than that, no

[18:04:56] <phuzzy> excellent, gonna check those out

[21:29:49] <Rounin> diophantom: Ah, well, if you're implementing your own list, it might be simpler to not worry about the Stream API and just use a loop that picks .next, .next, .next, .next as you go through thel ist
[21:30:04] <Rounin> Depends on what the assignment says, of course
[21:30:35] <Rounin> There's not a lot of theory involved, though... If you need your start node, you have a pointer to it... If you need another node, you just go to the next node, and the next, and so on, until you have the right one
[21:30:36] <diophantom> i have a for loop that prints out the objects as string
[21:30:49] <diophantom> that's how far i've got
[21:31:00] <Rounin> Sounds pretty good
[21:31:49] <Rounin> Ah... But of course, if you want to replace an object in the list with another object (not just modify the object, but replace it with a completely new one), you'll need to update the next pointer of the previous object in the list
[21:31:59] <Rounin> Well... Or, no
[21:32:24] <Rounin> Usually you'll have a list node, and then the content of the node will be in something like a "data" field of that object
