[00:32:16] <blaub> you crate yourself an install script?
[00:32:27] <jason1234> well, the usually thing is the pacstrap base linux and then to edit /etc/shadow to remove * to get full root acess at reboot
[00:32:39] <apestoso> i mean because of the yay packages, not yay itself since it can be installed as root, but not its packages
[00:32:46] <ouestbillie> apestoso: id seperate in two scripts, one for bootstrapping and one after install to setup less critical stuff like aur packages you like

[00:48:26] <Disconsented> I'd rather deal with rolling release than debian style upgrades >_>
[00:48:48] <BrainDamage> it is dangerous, but it's low importance and I figured it'd be a useful experiment
[00:48:53] <jason1234> or ubuntu
[00:48:54] <jelle> sounds fun
[00:49:04] <another|> jason1234: too much bledding edge for my taste
[00:49:06] <ouestbillie> SponiX: it will work, most of the time, but access control is a shitshow, if you have kerberos, LDAP PAM wtv you need to synchronize all this stuff, wouldnt mess manually with shadow
[00:49:13] <MrElendig> freebsd is nice on servers, until you get some modern hardware, or a network card that isn't intel
[00:49:44] <ouestbillie> ^^ waiting for them to support systemd

[02:34:38] <Aryan> how can I change to lts kernel ?
[02:35:12] <jason1234> so you just need to have a right ntdpdate to get that clock on time
[02:35:16] <_mikey> just install it and select it from grub or systemd-boot when you boot. whichever you use.
[02:35:34] <jason1234> ntpdate is fine to get the right time, with net and lan. (dhcpcd ...).
[02:35:34] <_mikey> you can have multiple kernels.

Should the PKGBUILD have built this older version of zfs-utils anyway or is the user expected to install the older version themselves? Is my only option to go to the AUR

[09:20:53] <mpan> Satin: I don’t know how SDDM works. Assuming that it just executes some scripts, is it possible that you have lines executing Plasma and Xfce placed wrong and executing one after another? In particular the startxfce4 line missing an `exec`?

[15:31:56] <wyre> mpan, I'm maintaining this PKGBUILD https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=ttf-minecrafter and ... I'm not sure if that's the appropriate way to do it (line 18)
[15:31:57] <phrik> Title: PKGBUILD - aur.git - AUR Package Repositories (at aur.archlinux.org)
[15:32:52] <mpan> Also don’t feel bad about missing that: commands that do very similar, but slightly different things depending on minor differences in invocation syntax are horribly confusing. In particular if all the options are given in one run.
[15:32:57] <wyre> I mean, ... if you rebuild the package ... the "$pkgdir/usr/share/fonts/TTF/" folder exists ... 
[15:33:06] <wyre> so I'm not sure if I should use the -t syntax 🤔
[15:33:39] <wyre> mpan, so do you think install command could be improved? 
[15:33:42] <mpan> `-t DIR SRC…` is “copy all SRC… into DIR”. With `-D` it will create `DIR` if needed.

[15:34:35] <ouestbillie> hey yall reading the wiki and im trying to find an obvious way to change default theme for qt apps, i don't really care about integration with gtk... I just want clementine to stop being so ugly tbh
[15:35:04] <wyre> mpan, so with -t argument 'DIR' may be not created? 
[15:35:15] <mpan> I believe this is what you want: `install -Dm644 -t "$pkgdir/usr/share/fonts/TTF/" "$srcdir/"*.ttf` — assuming the number of .ttf files doesn’t exeed the maximum number of command-line arguments (something in thousands).
[15:35:33] <mpan> (`-t` written separately for clarity only)
[15:35:57] <wyre> oh, so you can use -D in the -t syntax? ...

[15:37:06] <mpan> -d      create all leading components of DEST except the last, **or all components of --target-directory,**  — `--target-directory` is `-t`.
[15:37:14] <wyre> oh, I see so the point is not actually -D vs -t
[15:37:38] <wyre> because they can be used simultaneously
[15:37:42] <mpan> So -d works in both the 1st and 3rd form.
[15:37:50] <mpan> ARG
[15:37:53] <mpan> -D not -D
[15:37:58] * mpan slaps his fingers.
[15:38:15] <mpan> -D works in both the 1st and 3rd form. Also it should be -D in the manual quote above. :)
[15:38:16] <bertptrs> are you alright
[15:38:23] <wyre> I think I got you 😊
[15:38:33] <mpan> Yeah, but I misspelled -D as -d. :P
[15:38:39] <wyre> sure
[15:39:42] <wyre> mpan, what about the second form? could it be used -D with it? 
[15:39:50] <mpan> IIRC no, lemme see.
[15:41:42] <mpan> It seem to work, but the manual doesn’t reflect that IMO and for some reason I remember this is not the right way to do it. Though I no longer recall why.

[21:24:23] <TiZ> Hi, all. My system has been much less stable over the past several days. My computer will sporadically lose networking completely, with an inability to change connection state on any of my adapters, as if NetworkManager itself is failing. And when I shut down, the timeout timers on systemd just keep changing indefinitely. It'll reach a timeout
[21:24:23] <TiZ> target and then just... literally move the goalpost, and hence never actually shut down, so I have to REISUB it. Has anyone else been experiencing anything like this?
