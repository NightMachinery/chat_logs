[00:00:29] <GuiToris> blkshp, just said something that kept me thinking... it's one thing that I don't like something, but it's an other thing when someone confirms you
[00:00:46] <GuiToris> (comma is because of tab completion, he's the subject)
[00:00:51] <mdogg> papna: Try not to use the word "like" in that context.  It's a 'filler' word.  A lot of kids do it, but it isn't correct grammar.

[00:02:18] <GuiToris> how do you know if something is a cultural difference or the person does have some sort of mental illness?
[00:02:38] <CuriosTiger> It's, like, how valley girls talk, and stuff.
[00:02:51] <papna> mdogg: It is not a filler word in that context, though I do use it as a filler word as well and am not interested in being shamed for it.
[00:03:00] <CuriosTiger> It, like, totally makes you sound spaced out, like, you know, dumb.
[00:04:00] <mdogg> papna: It's grammatically incorrect.  I'm not trying to shame you, I'm telling you that you are not using it properly.  Like is a simile.   
[00:04:56] <CuriosTiger> mdogg: I think he's aware of the usage. But in colloquial English, like does get used as an interjection.
[00:05:20] <papna> mdogg: You are foolish and wrong. It is not grammatically incorrect, quotative like is widely used in informal speech in my dialect of English and is well-understood and widely used and heavily documented.
[00:05:36] <CuriosTiger> even as a makeshift compound verb. "I was like" == "I said", more or less.
[00:05:52] <papna> I wasn't using like as an interjection there as 'filler', I was using the _be like_ quotative.
[00:06:11] <GuiToris> let me rephrase that, is there any way to ask a person whether they have mental disorders without hurting them?
[00:06:21] * CuriosTiger adds the word "quotative" to his internal dictionary, as that's more fitting than my makeshift "compound verb" description.
[00:06:21] <papna> https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/11/the-evolution-of-like/507614/
[00:06:24] <papna> > Then, the two likes I have mentioned must be distinguished from yet a third usage, the quotative like—as in “And she was like, ‘I didn’t even invite him.’ ” This is yet another way that like has become grammar.
[00:10:38] <mdogg> I would not teach someone to use "like" in such a way when constructing sentences.  I realize it is an informal way of speaking.
[00:11:11] <mdogg> I have to agree with CuriosTiger, though.  Even though it may be used a lot when speaking informally, it doesn't sound good.
[00:11:15] <mdogg> And it looks even worse written down.

[00:12:12] <mdogg> I am a snob because I think people should learn to speak English properly?
[00:12:17] <CuriosTiger> mdogg: I was mocking the valley girl accent a bit, but you have to realize IRC is an informal communication medium. Colloquial speech is expected here, even if it's a written form of communication.

[00:14:44] <CuriosTiger> I remember the first time I learned the phrase "shut up".
[00:14:52] <blkshp> 'chut up.
[00:14:58] <blkshp> Donnie Darko
[00:15:16] <CuriosTiger> I don't remember who was playing, but it was from some American action movie. And the American pronunciation of the t sounded like an r to us.
[00:15:19] <mdogg> When I was supper little, I thought "shut up" was a bad phrase.
[00:15:33] <CuriosTiger> add in the Norwegian spelling of the sh sound, and the way we wrote "shut up" was skjerepp
[00:15:50] <mdogg> Super ^
[00:16:39] <mdogg> Like "shit".  I was only about 5 or so I guess.  But I remember a bigger kid telling me to "shut up" and I threatened to tell his mom..  
[00:16:58] <GuiToris> what does Ing. mean in front of names?
[00:17:36] <mdogg> I don't recall ever having seen that, GuiToris.
[00:17:41] <papna> It's actually somewhat frustrating at times in more formal registers not to have quotative like. It can be tricky to convey what someone said -- you don't have exact quotes, so you either need to caveat quotes with a mouthful or to phrase things without quotes, which can be a lot less clear and dynamic.
[00:18:09] <GuiToris> mdogg, I didn't find it either, that okay then :)

[00:24:50] <blkshp> real flu or man flu?
[00:25:00] <blkshp> and as a man that's had both, I know the difference lol
[00:25:12] <CuriosTiger> I'm not sure I do.
[00:25:13] <twb> IDGI
[00:25:32] <CuriosTiger> I have the kind of flu that involves stuffy sinuses, a runny nose, joint aches and a general feeling of malaise.
[00:25:46] <twb> do you mean influenza A versus influenza B?
[00:25:48] <blkshp> So the theory is that men are poor at dealing with illness and a cold is REALLY bad so it's called flu when it's not flu. Therefore "man flu"
[00:25:56] <blkshp> CuriosTiger: that's a cold!
[00:26:14] <CuriosTiger> blkshp: Colds generally don't feel this miserable and don't usually involve joint aches.
[00:26:23] <AmalLight> GuiToris brainfuck is real brain fuck language

[00:26:44] <blkshp> Flu is when you can't get out of bed, head is spinning, joint pain and inflamation, vomiting until you are throwing up green bile and getting out of bed to go work is an impossibility rather than a niggle!

[00:27:11] <CuriosTiger> in that case, I've never had the flu, including when I've actually been diagnosed with the flu.

[00:55:19] <mdogg> A lot of fireplaces in the U.K. seem to be made so that they can burn wood or coal.  At least that's what it seems like when I watch "Escape to the Country".
[00:56:11] <CuriosTiger> "who's" is a contraction of "who is", and that verb is not appropriate here. "whose" is technically a pronoun, I believe, but it's what you need here.
[00:56:44] <AmalLight> whose is ok
[00:57:10] <mdogg> CuriosTiger is correct - my use of "who's" was not correct. 
[00:57:28] <CuriosTiger> mdogg: That appears likely, given that coal was a huge fuel source in the UK from the start of the industrial revolution well into the second half of the 20th century.
[00:58:03] <mdogg> But I think that twb overall had the best sentence in terms of writing something that is most succinct.  
[00:58:28] <AmalLight> ca i use "the ball is pushed by the player" or i must use "the ball be pushed by the player"? it is a passive action in real time
[00:58:30] <CuriosTiger> Not to mention in terms of actually spelling out everything on one line. He was just missing an "as".

[00:58:39] <AmalLight> *Can
[00:59:43] <CuriosTiger> AmalLight: "The ball is pushed by the player" is correct as a standalone sentence. The second form is a subjunctive, and would be used in a wider context. Ie. "If we require that the ball be pushed by the player, we should ensure he is wearing gloves."
[00:59:51] <mdogg> Coal was a huge fuel here in the U.S., too.  But I have never seen a fire place or heating stove in the U.S. that takes coal.  Only wood or pellets.
[01:00:11] <CuriosTiger> mdogg: Pardon my ignorance, but can't coal be used in place of pellets?
[01:00:13] <AmalLight> ok
[01:00:28] <mdogg> CuriosTiger: I'm not sure..
[01:00:31] <CuriosTiger> I am not very experienced with fireplaces, so I don't really know how you'd adapt them for use with coal.

[01:00:53] <mdogg> CuriosTiger: Maybe it can.  I've just never seen anybody use coal here.  But I obviously haven't been 'everywhere'.. heh
[01:01:03] <CuriosTiger> It just seems logical that the UK would've used more coal and less wood, since the country was largely deforested even before the industrial revolution began.
[01:01:16] <AmalLight> i thought today about this, because i was need of passive form of present continuous, but didn't find alternatives
[01:01:19] <CuriosTiger> whereas the US was basically covered in forests until modern times.
[01:01:31] <CuriosTiger> At least large chunks of it.
[01:01:39] <AmalLight> *for present continuous
[01:01:53] <mdogg> It just seems that when I watch that show (it's about selling and buying houses), the fireplaces are setup to burn at least coal - they don't look like they are deep enough to burn wood (some of them)

[05:58:22] <papna> I think African American English speakers sometimes do something similar, but my ear sometimes doesn't distinguish between a flap and an unvoiced t very well.
[06:04:49] <CuriosTiger> African Americans and Caribbean speakers in general often do this with th.
[06:04:52] <CuriosTiger> ie this -> dis.
[06:05:29] <CuriosTiger> However, I use the American flap t myself, and this is very distinct from that.

[06:07:58] <LjL> i've listened to your clip but my pronunciation is too terrible to provide opinions :)
[06:09:07] <CuriosTiger> I use an American flap consonant in words like water, better etc. That's not the sound I'm hearing here. papna's links show I'm not alone, which makes me feel somewhat validated. :)
[06:11:10] <LjL> i find it difficult to pronounce a flap after r
[06:11:25] <LjL> uhm
[06:11:51] <LjL> actually i take that back, i think i find it difficult to pronounce a flap after "th" in "thirteen" in particular, i seem to have much less trouble pronouncing it in "fourteen"
[06:12:15] <LjL> although i suspect my usual pronunciation of those numbers is with an aspirated /t/ so whatever
[06:13:02] <CuriosTiger> In these numbers, they are very obvious voiced d's, not flaps.
[06:13:34] <CuriosTiger> an aspirated t is my pronunciation there as well. I don't use the same t  in "fourteen" that I do in "water".
[06:14:12] <LjL> i guess it's a morphological boundary for you, we write it as single words but you're still pronouncing "teen" as its own separate morpheme
[06:14:45] <LjL> although i wouldn't say "thir" by itself is anything in particular, so don't quote me on this explanation :P

[06:27:22] <LjL> CuriosTiger, it's similar to a word boundary except it's got a little less than the status of a word. for instance, compound words in many language are considered single "words" but in reality at the morpheme boundary (i.e. where the ex-words meet) whatever happens at a regular word boundary still happens
[06:27:43] <LjL> for example, in Finnish, normally any word has either all back vowels or all front vowels, due to vowel harmony
[06:27:53] <LjL> but in a compound word the two words can differ and that's fine
[06:28:18] <LjL> but that's not about the boundary, just an example of things that happen when a words is really multiple words
[06:28:23] <CuriosTiger> Ah. And yeah, these are like two words, although the thir- is more like a prefix than a standalone word.

[07:18:19] <Maxdamantus> 14:19:23 < CuriosTiger> https://youtu.be/fkpwG4jCT0I?t=9638 == it sounds to me like he is saying "thirdeen" and "fourdeen" rather than thirteen and fourteen. Is this characteristic of some Australian dialects?
[07:18:40] <Maxdamantus> I'd say that's pretty typical in all Australian/NZ dialects I can think of, including mine (NZ).
[07:18:53] <CuriosTiger> Maxdamantus: Cool, thanks for the confirmation.
[07:19:35] <Maxdamantus> I guess his use of it in that context is unlike my dialect though, so probably more Australian than NZ.

[07:19:52] <CuriosTiger> Well, he's from Tasmania.
[07:20:08] <CuriosTiger> But how is it unlike yours?
[07:21:19] *** de-facto_ is now known as de-facto
[07:21:48] <Maxdamantus> It seems different simply because of the timing around his use of the word "thirteen". I would probably use [t] there rather than [ɾ] because it's not being said quickly alongside other words.
[07:22:07] <Maxdamantus> The way he says it seems lazier.
[07:24:47] <CuriosTiger> Yeah, it's not the clearest of enunciations. Probably also not helped by the fact that he's chatting into a microphone for hours while focusing on soldering work. :)
[07:26:52] <Maxdamantus> I meant within my dialect, if I said it like that in his context, it would seem lazy, but in his dialect it seems normal.
[07:28:21] <CuriosTiger> Ah
[07:28:51] <Maxdamantus> and I don't think NZers/Australians would find the pronunciation any harder to understand than [t], as both sounds are used somewhat interchangably, it's just that there are different tendencies to use one rather than the other.
[07:29:17] <Maxdamantus> eg, in "butter", I would very rarely use [t].
[07:30:18] <CuriosTiger> In butter, I would use neither a t nor a d, but a flap consonant, also known as an alveolar tap.
[07:30:35] <Maxdamantus> Yeah, that's what I mean, [ɾ].
[07:30:45] <CuriosTiger> From what I can tell, that's common in both American and Australian English. ANd I presume NZ as well.
[07:30:49] <Maxdamantus> That's also the sound he's using afaict.
[07:31:01] <CuriosTiger> It sounds very distinct to me. It's a full-on d, not a tap.
[07:31:26] <CuriosTiger> ie. a voiced dental stop, not a tap.
[07:32:27] <Maxdamantus> There's probably some overlap between the two sounds, but I'd say a [d] there would sound different.

[07:42:07] <Maxdamantus> CuriosTiger: to be fair, they probably would be ambiguous in my dialect, so you'd probably have to emphasise the [d] even further if you needed to disambiguate.

[07:48:09] *** Joins: amigojapan (uid86330@id-86330.helmsley.irccloud.com)
[07:51:14] <CuriosTiger> Maxdamantus: Thanks for the sample. I consistently hear a d in this recording too, but if you say you pronounce them as a flap, I could certainly be mishearing them.
[07:51:50] <CuriosTiger> Or my brain could be playing some kind of trick on me where it pretends to perceive the sound differently because it figures a particular sound goes with a particular accent.
[07:52:18] <Maxdamantus> I've tried to emphasise use of a [d] sound in the first part of the recording (which seems weird, because "fourdeen" and "thirdeen" are not words).
[07:52:56] <Maxdamantus> I suspect in both cases they would be interpreted as the same thing, but if "fourdeen" were a separate word, the first utterance would probably be recognised as that rather than as "fourteen".
[07:53:38] <CuriosTiger> Whether a tap or a stop, it sounds voiced.
[07:54:17] <Maxdamantus> Yes, they're both voiced. The tap you use is probably also voiced.
[07:54:18] <CuriosTiger> I'd record a sample for you, but I've got the flu and have no voice.
[07:54:51] <CuriosTiger> Yep, my tap is voiced in words like butter, better, batter, water, crater, bitter.
[07:55:01] <CuriosTiger> but not in fourteen and thirteen
[07:55:17] <CuriosTiger> I realize that t as an unvoiced dental stop, I think.
[07:56:14] <CuriosTiger> actually, I think it's an alveolar stop. I'm literally sitting here trying to figure out where my tongue is when I make a t. :P
[07:57:08] <CuriosTiger> And...that's weird. It's different between my English and my Norwegian pronunciation. Way more fronted, dental in Norwegian, more back in English.
[07:57:20] <Maxdamantus> I suspect the main difference is probably just where your tongue is. I think in NZ/Australian accents, the tongue is usually further forward than in US accents.
[07:57:39] <CuriosTiger> I think you may be onto something.
[07:57:40] <Maxdamantus> If I imagine myself saying "butter" in an American accent, the tap is further back.
[07:57:58] <CuriosTiger> Both my tap and my stop -- which are admittedly very similar -- are further back in English.
[07:58:07] <CuriosTiger> whereas my Norwegian t is more fronted.
[07:58:34] <CuriosTiger> (Norwegian does not use the tap for t, although it can in some cases use it for r.)
[07:59:27] <Maxdamantus> and if I say something like "teeth", I imagine my tongue behind my teeth for that [θ] sound in an American accent, but it would normally be between my teeth in my normal accent.
[08:00:53] <Maxdamantus> Would you use a flap for "rudder"?
[08:01:06] <Maxdamantus> because "butter" and "rutter" basically rhyme for me.
[08:01:13] <Maxdamantus> er, "butter" and "rudder".
[08:01:49] <Maxdamantus> and "shutter"/"shudder" sound more-or-less the same.

[08:05:03] <Maxdamantus> CuriosTiger: also, can you tell me what this says? https://maxdamantus.eu.org/shuxxer.wav
[08:05:21] <CuriosTiger> Maxdamantus: My voice sounds horrible, but here's an attempt. YouTube also decided to turn the video sideways for, err, reasons, but the audio is what matters. https://youtu.be/m7BhurAJGtU
[08:05:42] <CuriosTiger> And that says "shutter".
[08:06:03] <CuriosTiger> although I suppose it could also be "shudder".
[08:06:15] <CuriosTiger> In fact, I think those two are homophones for me.
[08:07:15] <Maxdamantus> I took it from the Wiktionary page for "shutter". The page for "shudder" has a pronunciation with a more emphasised [d] sound, which is what I was going for with my recording.
[08:07:48] <Maxdamantus> but yeah, I suspect in normal speech they would probably be said the same way.
[08:08:27] <CuriosTiger> In that situation, I pronounce both the same. Both use a tap. Same thing with udder and utter, cdr (pronounced "cudder") and cutter, etc.
[08:09:14] <CuriosTiger> I also added in "teeth" just because the YouTube short cut off.
[08:11:01] <Maxdamantus> Yeah, definitely sounds like your tongue is behind your teeth.
[08:12:14] <CuriosTiger> It is. Far more so in English than in Norwegian. Which is something I didn't realize until I sat here and sounded it out.
[08:12:25] <CuriosTiger> but my fourteen and thirteen are quite distinct from yours.

[08:18:39] *** Joins: The_Blode (~Blode@user/the-blode/x-7164444)
[08:18:43] <CuriosTiger> That's sounding more like an alveolar tap. And less like the guy from Tasmania.
[08:19:13] <Maxdamantus> You mean a voiceless one?
[08:19:54] <CuriosTiger> Also, your pronunciation of "eight" sounds like it has a final tch, almost like eitch.
[08:20:07] <CuriosTiger> Yeah, I suppose I do.
[08:20:24] <CuriosTiger> But also more distinctly a tap than a stop...although that could also be just because you're speaking very rapidly.
[08:21:49] <CuriosTiger> Also, only twenty teeth? ;)
[08:26:37] <Maxdamantus> I think NZ accents relative to US ones are usually described as having a difference in aspiration of voiceless plosives, and I guess a US accent will also usually not aspirate a final stop, whereas it seems normal in my accent.
[08:28:16] <CuriosTiger> unvoiced stops are always aspirated in American English, I believe.
[08:28:24] <papna> If it's a tap, it's a lot further forward than I make in "butter" (American). I would guess it was just an unaspirated d.
[08:28:42] <CuriosTiger> At least word-initially.
[08:28:48] <papna> But I don't have a great ear for these distinctions, since they're allophones for me.
[08:28:54] <CuriosTiger> Sitting here sounding out words again.
[08:29:18] <CuriosTiger> papna: I think I may have be having the same problem isolating specific qualities of each sound.
[08:30:12] <CuriosTiger> In particular, as I sit here making noises at my computer screen, I'm coming to the realization that another difference between a tapped and a stop t is that the former is unaspirated while the latter is not.
[08:30:49] <CuriosTiger> so both voicing and aspiration differ, whereas place of articulation does not differ the way I thought it would.

[12:43:54] <cAMP> Hi, I am struggling with a sentence. I'm wondering how can some non-specific group of people solve a multiheaded problem of conflict. So far I have settled with "However will we find peace again?". I'm struggling if However is the correct question, and if this should end with again, also if using "we" seems strange here.
[12:44:38] <cAMP> The context is a blog post, the sentence is the last one in 3rd paragraph: https://csmr.kapsi.fi/blog/posts/20220311-vladiwar-vladiwarovich.html

[22:06:43] <LuisR14> i mean, that's generally exempt

[22:10:46] <TimMc> GuiToris: "Oversight" is related, and is an auto-antonym. :-(
