[14:28:06] <horseface> hello!
[14:28:13] <horseface> i have an issue with my mail server...
[14:29:00] <horseface> it is that it seems that sometimes, if not always, when i send an email, it is marked as SPAM and received into the recipients SPAM inbox...
[14:29:04] <horseface> what is causing this..?
[14:31:27] <Atque> horseface: Have you set the rDNS of your IP to point to domain name of your SMTP process?
[14:33:24] <horseface> hmm...
[14:33:30] <Khepra> horseface: usually the recipient's email would have headers that tell you why it's spam. if it doesn't, the recipient has to ask the provider why it's spam. if that's gmail, then the reason is "Wflaksjdla fjlksfdslka fljk fsdj   herp derp bwahahaha, Imma Junk your mail bceause it's friday. "
[14:33:31] <horseface> let me look into this...
[14:33:31] <Atque> That is a SMTP process claiming to be example.org will generally be marked as spam unless you set the PTR record of the in-addr.arpa thingo to the thing.
[14:33:57] <horseface> mm...
[14:34:14] <Khepra> Atque: maybe yes, maybe not. It's a sound advice to have rDNS, yes. but that's doesn't often mean anything.
[14:34:30] <pj> !t horseface deliverability
[14:34:31] <horseface> thanks for the information, i will investigate. is this anything to do with dkim something rather?
[14:34:31] <dig-dug> horseface: deliverability: (#1) If you're having problems getting your mail received by major ESPs you should first check your !fcrdns, then make sure you have SPF, DKIM and DMARC configured (see !easy_dmarc). Sign up for the dnswl at http://www.dnswl.org. Also sign up for ESP-specific programs such as feedback loops, Google postmaster tools and Microsoft's SNDS., or (#2) Check the individual postmaster pages for each
[14:34:32] <dig-dug> ESP that you're having problems with to make sure that you're in compliance with all of their policies and if you still have problems contact the support for the ESP., or (#3) Also check to make sure you're not on any DNSRBLs and submit removal requests from any you appear on. See !multirbl.
[14:35:01] <Atque> Khepra: Yea
[14:35:17] <horseface> thank you@
[14:35:18] <horseface> !
[14:35:32] <horseface> i will research and look into all of these now...
[14:35:40] <pj> horseface: go through all of this stuff in the deliverability factoid, any one of those things could be affecting you ^^^^^
[14:35:42] <Atque> Lots of places also spam list residential IDR blocks.
[14:36:19] <Atque> But you can change the rDNS and see if that works I guess. Most of the other causes are kind of beyond your control.
[14:39:48] <Khepra> "[...]  sometimes [...] an email [...] is marked as SPAM [...]"      ... this sometimes will hapen often even if you had dkim, dmarc, spf, sacrified two goats, the chicken is hanging upside down and bleeding out in the basement, and the pentagram is freshly carved underneath it, in the granite slab imported from an african war region, thus soaked with more blood....   if the recipient is gmail.
[14:40:01] <Khepra> this "sometimes" will happen ....
[14:41:54] <pj> Khepra: but did you sacrifice *three* goats?  perhaps that extra goat would have made the difference.
[14:42:33] <Khepra> I'm fresh out of goats to try :)
[14:42:47] <Atque> Khepra: What about if you sacrifice chocolate, wine and a fish at the summer equinox while running a mail server written in Rust using Azure cloud functions?
[14:42:51] <pj> well then how can you know it wouldn't have helped?
[14:43:40] <Khepra> I don't :)
[14:44:29] <Khepra> this is one of those jokes where, if one were to _literally_ try all that, would find the statement factually true. :)
[14:45:04] <pj> lol
[14:45:42] <pj> I can just see someone doing all that and then their email starts going through.
[14:45:43] <horseface> hey guys, does these look correct?
[14:45:44] <horseface> https://i.ibb.co/wcbtpXy/Screenshot-from-2022-01-21-21-14-48.png
[14:46:17] <pj> horseface: I tend to not look at screenshots, what are you trying to show, and use a pastebin with actual text in it.
[14:46:28] <horseface> one sec...
[14:46:34] <pj> !paste
[14:46:35] <dig-dug> pj: paste: A pastebin is a way to share larger amounts of data with others, without flooding the channel with garbage. You can find pastebins at paste.debian.net, apaste.info, dpaste.org, fpaste.org, pastebin.ca, paste.ee, ptpb.pw, ix.io and various other sites. Please avoid using pastebins with active content or intrusive ads such as pastebin.com. Remember to share the URL of the resulting paste in channel.
[14:46:53] <horseface> it is just that there are three fields and three rows...
[14:47:15] <horseface> and it is quite an effort to transfer it into a pastebin...
[14:47:22] <horseface> but i will...
[14:47:24] <horseface> one sec...
[14:48:25] <horseface> https://bpa.st/GB6A
[14:48:32] <horseface> this is one of the fields...
[14:48:33] <pj> not a lot I can say about that, there are services that will check that for you, but I don't have time to do it myself right now.
[14:48:45] <horseface> oh?
[14:48:56] <horseface> could you please name me such a service?
[14:48:57] <horseface> :-)
[14:49:02] <Khepra> horseface: other than checking the _form_ which _seems_ correct, what pj said, you really need to test out the actual domain records and keys within
[14:49:17] <horseface> i did...
[14:49:31] <horseface> the key matches the one in; /etc/mail/dkim/public.key
[14:49:44] <pj> yeah, they look correct, all I can recommend is I typically use ip4 and ip6 entries in SPF records instead of a and mx
[14:50:17] <pj> only because a and mx require the remote server to do additional DNS lookups which creates more potential points of failure.
[14:50:57] <pj> but the entry is not intrinsically wrong, it's just the only thing I can pick out of all of that to critique.
[15:33:36] <horseface> i did check the SPF and DKIM records, and these seem to be fine.
[15:33:42] <horseface> so what else should i do/
[15:33:43] <horseface> ?
[15:34:35] <horseface> what is this 'rDNS'?
[15:34:46] * pj points to the deliverability factoid.
[15:35:02] <pj> !fcrdns
[15:35:03] <dig-dug> pj: fcrdns: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_Confirmed_reverse_DNS : your IP address should resolve to your HELO/EHLO hostname, which in turn should resolve back to your IP. This is very important if you want big sites to accept your mail. If you can't have it from your ISP, see !relayhost
[15:49:55] <horseface> thanks patron!

[23:06:47] <colo> so, dkim key length/size. apparently, my DNS provider has trouble serving TXT records with 2048bit keys in them, and ed25519 isn't really there either. what's one supposed to do?
[23:07:45] <lunaphyte> if it were me, i would switch to a competent dns provider
[23:08:21] <colo> and use rsa2048 there?
[23:09:37] <lunaphyte> with a competent dns provider, it will not matter
[23:11:52] <colo> well, I just contacted their support to learn what's going on
[23:12:09] <colo> their web interface feigns everything to work, but I can't resolve the TXT RR
[23:12:44] <colo> never had troubles with them before in ~15 years, so I am relucant to jump ship
[23:13:20] <lunaphyte> i guess "has trouble serving" will need to be explained
[23:13:42] <Khepra> tuxick: I just outright NOQUEUE if ya gots no arr dee ehn ess
[23:14:35] <Khepra> so far 0 complaints over the years and apparently it stops a lot of canned meat. of non-ham persuasion.
[23:14:52] <colo> lunaphyte, it's like the record weren't in the zone in the first place
[23:15:34] <lunaphyte> exhibited by way of what symptom?
[23:15:37] <Khepra> colo: how are you checking it?
[23:16:11] <colo> Khepra, by using dig to query the record from the NS for the zone
[23:16:32] <lunaphyte> and the result was what?
[23:17:20] <colo> lunaphyte, none at all. querying the "old" selector name in the same way yields the 1024bit public key data as expected.
[23:17:36] <lunaphyte> there is no such thing as a "none at all" result from dig
[23:18:06] <colo> there is, with +short
[23:18:10] <colo> it yields status: NXDOMAIN
[23:18:18] <lunaphyte> ah, actual information :)
[23:19:55] <lunaphyte> i guess it will be interesting to find out what the provider says about why the record is not being served
[23:26:21] <colo> does anyone of you use dkimpy-milter to handle DKIM and has observations to share on how pain(full|less) it is?
[23:26:54] <lunaphyte> i use opendkim
[23:27:34] <colo> same here, but it seems unlikely to support ed25519-sha256 soon.
[23:27:55] <lunaphyte> yeah
