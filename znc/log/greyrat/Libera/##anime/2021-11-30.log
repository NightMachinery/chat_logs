[07:56:19] <ButterNoodle> why
[07:56:24] <ButterNoodle> I want it to work..
[07:56:26] <MootPoot> lol
[07:56:32] <amigojapan> MootPoot: external battery
[07:56:51] <MootPoot> if you want it to work wouldn't you use debian or fedora
[07:56:59] <MootPoot> suse or whatever
[07:57:17] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  that's not a tablet - thats a pile of stuff stuck together lol
[07:57:23] <ButterNoodle> idk if any other installer creates an efi, secure /boot, and / without being a total pita to setup
[07:57:35] <MootPoot> there is that one linux tablet amigojapan but its wayyyyyyy too much
[07:57:38] <MootPoot> I think I linked you
[07:58:13] <ButterNoodle> naa, if I didnt have linux skills or just wanted something canned and ready to use.. I'd install something like that
[07:58:21] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you can probably out Linux on many other tablets
[07:58:32] <ButterNoodle> mint or manjaro fits the bill
[07:58:56] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  I checked - unfortunatley they're mostly all just broken in some way
[07:59:02] <MootPoot> technically it can work 
[07:59:45] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: is mint really a noob OS?
[08:00:00] <MootPoot> it dosen't have all the crap stapled on it like ubuntu does
[08:00:01] <ButterNoodle> idk
[08:00:09] <MootPoot> when I tried it
[08:00:20] <MootPoot> can I get templeOS on a ARM tablet
[08:00:41] <MootPoot> nutter butter 
[08:00:44] <amigojapan> No MootPoot 
[08:00:46] <ButterNoodle> I installed mint in a vm and it was minty
[08:00:57] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: buying a MoCa adapter as soon as I get paid tommorow 
[08:01:04] <MootPoot> 2.5 gbit to the basement over coax
[08:01:07] <ButterNoodle> I have been using that to test my new router
[08:01:10] <MootPoot> for 150 usd
[08:01:15] <ButterNoodle> good luck :)
[08:01:15] <amigojapan> MootPoot: templeos is intel 64 bit
[08:01:23] <MootPoot> amigojapan: it was a joke lol
[08:01:53] <ButterNoodle> I need that ported to run on cyrix 5x86
[08:02:04] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: I did the math and its the only option that works ( excluding shit solutions like wifi or powerline which really dont work very well ) and costs less then getting a guy in to wire all the way down
[08:02:12] <MootPoot> even if I did wire it all the way down - won't work
[08:02:16] <ButterNoodle> everyone knows cyrix is gonna make a comeback
[08:02:23] <MootPoot> it'll get to be the same price*
[08:02:28] <MootPoot> so MoCa it is
[08:02:41] <MootPoot> supposedly MoCa 3 can do 10gbit over coax
[08:02:49] <ButterNoodle> yea.. its probably the only way u gonna get over 1 gig down there anyway
[08:02:51] <MootPoot> although the spec is too recent to have any available adapters 
[08:04:06] <MootPoot> seems like only 3-4 companies make MoCa stuff though

[11:58:21] <amigojapan> Ah ok. I thought vshoujo was English only

[13:17:27] <DunceCotus> so they give you iced milk
[13:17:42] <hans> haha where
[13:17:57] <DunceCotus> well that was an anecdote from a friend
[13:18:00] <DunceCotus> not sure where
[13:18:03] <hans> kk
[13:18:18] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: iced milk is not supposed to be a milk shake

[13:19:12] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: yes
[13:20:30] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: iced milk is actually "chilled milk"in a glass

[13:21:33] <amigojapan> zoidberg: no cause they add sugar
[13:21:40] <zoidberg> ah
[13:22:03] <zoidberg> I am not sure if it's good without sugar amigojapan, never tried one without
[13:22:08] <amigojapan> zoidberg: I want it, but Withought sugar
[13:22:38] <amigojapan> zoidberg: I also drink coffee with milk and no sugar

[13:44:57] <amigojapan> Time for merienda
[13:48:19] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: oh this isn't related to flat earth per se
[13:48:38] <DunceCotus> but rather history not depicted in our mainstream history books etc
[13:50:10] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it's just a story
[13:50:57] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the map is a real map
[13:51:47] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: perhaps
[13:52:07] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: old maps were weird
[13:52:19] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: there's a lot of these old maps that make no sense at all in the context of our mainstream history
[13:52:41] <DunceCotus> they're considered by mainstream history to be hoaxes or 'artistic liberties' etc.
[13:52:45] <DunceCotus> but that doesn't really make sense either
[13:54:00] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: like there's mentions of "Great Tartary/Tartarie", not just in old maps but old historical artefacts
[13:54:14] <DunceCotus> but mainstream history has literally nothing to say about it
[13:54:23] <DunceCotus> they do mention Tatars but that's completely different
[13:54:54] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its increasingly clear that the victors have manipulated our understanding of history
[14:00:39] <DunceCotus> its becoming clear that a cataclysm wiped out mega global empires
[14:01:36] <DunceCotus> Tartary was one of them, possibly still existed post-cataclysm but in a diminished state 
[14:01:49] <DunceCotus> and then there was a war of sorts between the remaining empires
[14:01:58] <DunceCotus> which lasted up till early 1900s possibly
[14:02:16] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: tartar sauce
[14:02:24] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: yes
[14:02:30] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: also dental tartar
[14:03:27] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the collapse of these global empires was a huge blow to human consciousness
[14:03:35] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: same with Atlantis
[14:03:36] <DunceCotus> so it was repressed or possibly suppressed
[14:04:01] *** Quits: flynn (~mcbloch@user/flynn) (Quit: Ping timeout (120 seconds))
[14:04:02] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: well Atlantis was a fable even in Plato's time
[14:04:23] <DunceCotus> some think he was referring to a made up empire, others think it was real but gone by Plato's time
[14:04:44] <amigojapan> Now we have real Atlanta
[14:05:02] <DunceCotus> however if we go by revised estimates of the "ancients" they were probably not that ancient 
[14:05:12] <DunceCotus> possibly existed up till the 1700s
[14:05:47] <DunceCotus> because the architecture of the great empires (which we still have some examples of today) came in all sorts of styles
[14:05:54] <DunceCotus> but one of them was a particularly greco-roman style
[14:06:27] <DunceCotus> so I think that was from a time where we had global steampunk empires, people knocking about in togas cause it was temperate climate all over the world
[14:06:57] <DunceCotus> at some point the balmy but level temperatures dramatically shifted, possibly due to the cataclysms
[14:07:18] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: they didn't even need windows
[14:07:29] <DunceCotus> I believe they just had openings
[14:07:37] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: there is actual record of some cities disappearing like pompei
[14:07:58] <DunceCotus> pompei was relatively late in the game
[14:08:08] <DunceCotus> but yes we have some records
[14:08:18] <DunceCotus> though I wonder if pompei was not an isolated incident
[14:09:30] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: basically this era of global empires was one of diverse exchange of traditions, beliefs, ethnicities etc
[14:09:56] <DunceCotus> there was such a thing as unified religious belief
[14:10:08] <DunceCotus> and possibly an economy that wasn't shite to 95% of the population
[14:11:20] <amigojapan> Make a steampunk engine and show me DunceCotus 
[14:11:41] *** Joins: LucaTM (~LucaTM@user/lucatm)
[14:11:45] <amigojapan> Do you mean stream engine?
[14:12:03] <DunceCotus> "steampunk" refers to a certain style of literary fiction
[14:12:27] <DunceCotus> whereby everything is made of clockwork, elegant brass, steam-powered machinery etc.
[14:12:50] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: they had steam-powered buses
[14:12:58] <DunceCotus> and pneumatic railways
[14:13:22] <DunceCotus> automatic lighting on the streets with plumbed gas lanterns
[14:13:32] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: that's in the industrial age
[14:13:45] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: this was industry before the industry we know
[14:13:47] <amigojapan> That actually happened
[14:14:12] <DunceCotus> well we had the Victorian era
[14:14:16] <DunceCotus> which was sorta steampunk
[14:14:47] <DunceCotus> but that's only cause it was a carry-over from the previous era
[14:15:01] <DunceCotus> an era which had a much longer lasting steampunk aesthetic I think
[14:15:33] <DunceCotus> it became less feasible to have steampunk
[14:15:46] <DunceCotus> to have the elegance of gold-paved roads
[14:15:54] <DunceCotus> finely finished brass ornamentation etc.
[14:16:11] <DunceCotus> that's because we no longer had the same conditions
[14:17:38] <DunceCotus> we now had to think about the climate, about fuel sources, about surpluses and maintaining power over those surpluses
[14:18:58] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: some speculate that this steampunk era of global empires was facilitated by "atmospheric electricity"
[14:19:11] <DunceCotus> or somehow drawing energy out of thin air
[14:19:47] <DunceCotus> this is why the Old World architecture is always so pointy -- spires everywhere
[14:20:23] <DunceCotus> those spires could have been used to draw the energy out of a charged atmosphere, more charged than our atmosphere currently is
[14:21:33] <amigojapan> Well I don't agree, but possibly pointy could be a way to avoid the inside of the house from being hit by lightning

[14:22:20] <DunceCotus> tell me they made that building in the middle ages..
[14:22:43] <DunceCotus> its just not feasible going by mainstream history
[14:23:01] <DunceCotus> look how fucking perfect it is
[14:23:17] <DunceCotus> at very least we have lost a lot of knowledge even from the supposed 'dark ages'
[14:23:29] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: but notice all the spires
[14:23:49] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: yes perhaps it was for lightning rods
[14:23:53] <amigojapan> The Colosseum was also quite perfect and way before that
[14:23:58] <DunceCotus> but that seems like lightning rod overkill
[14:24:05] <DunceCotus> unless the atmosphere was completely different back then
[14:24:17] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: it wasn't 'way before'
[14:24:28] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the ancients existed in middle ages
[14:24:51] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: we have greco-roman and gothic architecture here in Australia
[14:25:01] <DunceCotus> apparently it was built by colonial settlers :/
[14:25:11] <DunceCotus> who were also mostly prisoners
[14:25:15] <DunceCotus> just how?
[14:25:28] <DunceCotus> we can't build these structures today let alone in colonial times
[14:26:13] <DunceCotus> like look at modern architecture.. look at all the corners cut
[14:26:23] <DunceCotus> and zero spires to be found
[14:27:17] <DunceCotus> now sure there were probably some tricks to build these grand structures, like using facades etc.
[14:27:30] <DunceCotus> but even taking this into account, this would have been a huge undertaking with technology back then
[14:27:53] <DunceCotus> the history books suggest these sorts of buildings only take 1-2 years to build.. the timeline doesn't add up
[14:28:02] <amigojapan> !c spire
[14:28:04] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: I don't know.
[14:28:04] <DunceCotus> you can tell they are trying to jam everything into a very narrow timeline
[14:28:19] <DunceCotus> Spire, n. "(church service) a tall tower that forms the superstructure of a building (usually a church or temple) and that tapers to a point at the top"
[14:28:40] <amigojapan> Ah
[14:29:00] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: like these people knew sacred geometry like the back of their hands
[14:29:08] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: there are also architectural fashions, that is no longer in fashion
[14:29:23] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: their architecture alone tells us this is a very alien society to us today, and is not represented at all in our history books
[14:29:52] <DunceCotus> or if it is represented it is through distorted religio-cultural lens
[14:30:33] <DunceCotus> like they built cathedrals as churches (did they?) or the greco-roman structures we have today (aside from ruins) were recent imitations of the style, "neoclassical"
[14:30:46] <DunceCotus> but sure, there are varying degrees of quality to this architecture
[14:31:33] <DunceCotus> but a lot of them seem very old and need to be repaired or renovated, its when they do repairs that I think they make these structures look less impressive or even demolish them completely
[14:31:54] <DunceCotus> because they were not built to be maintained.. not in today's conditions anyway
[14:32:39] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: the construction of the Sagrada familia began in 1882 and it's still going on now https://images.app.goo.gl/5SMEJbc9V79qBGaS7

[14:33:15] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its convenient they made the construction start in 1882 because there's like no records
[14:33:30] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I do not think construction is still going on, I think they've had to repair it
[14:33:39] <DunceCotus> and the repair job is what has taken over a century 
[14:33:39] <DunceCotus> xD
[14:34:34] <DunceCotus> mind you the structures in my country are not nearly as intricately detailed as those found in Europe or UK
[14:35:05] <amigojapan> Ok
[14:35:25] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: like there's been a lot of these "old world" buildings demolished here
[14:35:45] <DunceCotus> they get demolished but why? They are/were a huge draw for tourism to my city
[14:36:36] <DunceCotus> perhaps they were not maintainable but even there im not sure, plenty of evidence these buildings can be modernised in terms of plumbing, electrical etc. 
[14:36:44] <amigojapan> I don't know why, what did they build instead?
[14:37:01] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: boring modern architecture
[14:37:06] <DunceCotus> boxy bullshit
[14:37:44] <DunceCotus> we can't build them today, I'm not even sure we can repair them properly today
[14:37:56] <DunceCotus> and we have very little in the way of records of their being built
[14:37:59] <DunceCotus> or how they were designed etc
[14:38:02] <DunceCotus> its all very odd
[14:38:03] <amigojapan> The owners probably thought they could make more money that way
[14:38:23] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: right, and that's another difference
[14:38:33] <DunceCotus> clearly these buildings were made at a time where money was no obstacle
[14:39:09] <DunceCotus> perhaps they were commissioned by kings/queens etc. but even so, this must have been quite a lavish time
[14:39:16] <DunceCotus> they made a lot of these buildings
[14:40:04] <DunceCotus> I wouldn't be surprised if even average citizens had dwellings of a similar style and decorum
[14:40:39] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: notice old japanese temples also have the spires (pointy bits at the top)
[14:40:48] <DunceCotus> this was worldwide
[14:40:59] <DunceCotus> just different styles depending on location
[14:42:31] <DunceCotus> the prevalence of these lavish buildings suggests they had ample time, resources/technology to make them.. possibly even make them on industrial scales?
[14:42:34] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: hmm tomako just said "luke, I am your father" I wonder what they said in Japanese
[14:42:53] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: hmm ok
[14:50:17] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: he says "chigau, omae no chichi ha washi da"which is "no, I am your father". The Mandela effect goes thru different languages

[16:18:36] <amigojapan> Ah ok zoidberg 
[16:19:36] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I also guess your mom is not called gonbe
[16:19:58] <zoidberg> what the dickens is gonbe?
[16:20:33] <darkwitch> my mom is not called gonbe but she comes from java
[16:20:54] <zoidberg> Indonesia Java?

[16:21:06] <amigojapan> zoidberg: just a character from the song I linked darkwitch 
[16:21:13] <darkwitch> yes, jakarta
[16:21:56] <zoidberg> you have interesting history darkwitch, my family dull as hell
[16:22:04] <darkwitch> is gonbe supposed to be gonbei 権兵衛 ?
[16:23:04] <amigojapan> darkwitch: probably bei is right, don't know the rest
[16:23:05] <zoidberg> btw amigojapan, it's Hannukah!
[16:23:24] <zoidberg> amigojapan: you have Jewish heritage right?
[16:23:45] <amigojapan> Yes zoidberg 
[16:24:20] <amigojapan> zoidberg: I used to celebrate hannuka with my grand parents
[16:24:35] <zoidberg> nice
[16:24:42] <zoidberg> I remember amigojapan 
[16:25:11] <zoidberg> amigojapan: do you used to light those candle thingies?
[16:25:27] <amigojapan> zoidberg: we typically got a dradle and several chocolate coins for Hanukka
[16:25:39] <amigojapan> Yes zoidberg 
[16:25:45] <zoidberg> nice
[16:26:04] <zoidberg> I learned that middle candle is called samarrah?
[16:26:13] <amigojapan> zoidberg: not expensive gifts
[16:26:13] <zoidberg> I hope I am saying this right
[16:26:30] <amigojapan> I am not sure
[16:26:49] <darkwitch> samsara?
[16:26:55] <amigojapan> zoidberg: ask Omega037 . He is still practicing
[16:28:06] <zoidberg> nah, I just looked up. It's shamash
[16:28:35] <zoidberg> that's not close at all
[16:28:41] <zoidberg> screw you zoidberg 
[16:29:26] <darkwitch> I need a knife
[16:29:34] <JesseDesu> I need a wife

[16:31:50] <JesseDesu> No No November is over, Dicks out December has started
[16:31:56] <zoidberg> yes amigojapan, that also I learned yesterday. In the ancient times they lit candle for 7 days with oil that's enough for 2days.
[16:32:32] <JesseDesu> how did they make it last 3.5 times longer
[16:32:37] <darkwitch> amigojapan, it has been picked from the tree
[16:32:52] <amigojapan> Yeah zoidberg it's a festivus MIRACLE!
[16:33:00] <zoidberg> lol amigojapan 
[16:33:04] <amigojapan> Ah ok darkwitch 
[16:34:13] <ahmubashshir> let's start a distro war. who use which distro (⊃‿⊂)
[16:34:37] <amigojapan> I use Linux mint cinamon
[16:34:38] <darkwitch> do they need to burn the candle in the daytime?
[16:34:49] <ahmubashshir> I use BTW
[16:35:14] <zoidberg> ahmubashshir: that won't start a war, if you want to start a war, say, "I hate loli" or "I love php"
[16:35:21] <zoidberg> or "I love Java"
[16:35:30] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I think we used to light them at sundown
[16:35:36] * ahmubashshir is feeling disappointed
[16:35:39] <zoidberg> "masturbation is bad" would also start a war
[16:36:23] <ahmubashshir> well then, I love nano, both vim and emacs are bad
[16:36:43] <ahmubashshir> let's start the editor war
[16:37:14] <darkwitch> why do you want a war?
[16:37:27] <ahmubashshir> nothing better to do...
[16:37:50] <ahmubashshir> got my slbr container deleted...
[16:38:07] <zoidberg> woah
[16:38:22] <ahmubashshir> slbr -> suicide linux battle royale
[16:38:30] <darkwitch> I'm sure you can think of something better than a war, if you really try
[16:38:51] <ahmubashshir> no chance again until the admin recreates the container
[16:39:04] <zoidberg> !addquote ahmubashshir well then, I love nano, both vim and emacs are bad, let's start the editor war
[16:39:04] <ImoutoBot> zoidberg: Quote added for ahmubashshir (1)
[16:39:26] <zoidberg> do you really really love nano ahmubashshir?

[16:42:18] <zoidberg> ugh, arch
[16:42:27] <ahmubashshir> I had fun installing arch
[16:42:32] <zoidberg> arch isn't good either, full of problems
[16:42:48] <zoidberg> installing is just one part, maintaining the system
[16:42:58] <zoidberg> on a long run, it's heh
[16:43:00] <ahmubashshir> feels more stable than debian to me 🙃
[16:43:15] <zoidberg> lol, no way

[16:44:42] <ahmubashshir> doesn't this prove that arch is stable enough?

[16:53:01] <amigojapan> Nice darkwitch 
[16:53:03] <ahmubashshir> stability of manjaro: rock-solid, until it breaks
[16:53:41] <ahmubashshir> stability of arch: just like the name says, it's arch, if it breaks, repair it and everything's ok
[16:53:42] <zoidberg> Sadale: you will wait till 4th of next month right?
[16:54:04] <amigojapan> ahmubashshir: I had the experience of many small things failing first and going in to fix them. And eventually not being able to reboot
[16:54:49] <ahmubashshir> manjaro breaks many rules of arch.
[16:55:05] <Sadale> zoidberg, if I want to use my sex toys for cumming, yep.

[17:20:50] <amigojapan> Omega037: I always got only a dradle and some chocolate coins and I was happy
[17:21:02] <Cryowolf> where anything above 5 means infection, the higher the number the more serious the infection
[17:21:27] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: yeah we were talking about temperature
[17:21:52] <Cryowolf> I had like 120+ CRP after my surgery in January :P
[17:22:00] <Cryowolf> I think it was even around 150
[17:22:21] <Cryowolf> when I left it was about 100 and then a month later it was about 30
[17:22:34] <Cryowolf> now it's between 1-20, fluctuates

[17:53:12] <Sadale> younger sis. that's the definition of an imouto
[17:53:41] <Sadale> I often have to help her on homework and shit when she got stuck. I wish I had an onee-chan or onii-chan helping me back when I was in college :/

[18:02:08] <omero> thus now I am curious Sadale ... whats the proper term to rever to the reverse of imouto (which by definition you say its the younger of the siblings)
[18:02:52] <Sadale> omero, onee-chan/onee-san.
[18:03:07] <Sadale> imouto = younger sister. onee-san = older sister.
[18:03:21] <Sadale> onii-chan = older brother. otouto = younger brother
[18:03:38] <Sadale> Japanese has separate words for younger and older siblings. Just like Chinese.
[18:03:57] <omero> oh! I understand now... thank you ... this explains several circumstances I was completely confused by that form
[18:05:00] <omero> as you might have guessed, I am not very aquainted with eastern forms of language
[18:08:47] <Sadale> ah. That's understandable. These words aren't commonly used outside weeb communities.
[18:09:03] * Sadale :3
[18:09:08] <omero> consider GMT+0 being the reference mark for 'west' and 'east' ... on a map... of our beloved rock
[18:11:21] <omero> the rock is of course being the 3rd one from the sun ;)
[18:11:46] <omero> someone has said... all is relative.
[18:12:31] <Sadale> hmm I think not. GMT+0 is rather west
[18:12:44] <Sadale> The east-west line is probably closer to GMT+3/+4
[18:13:13] <Sadale> It's in the western side of Russia. It's the division between Asia and Europe

[19:39:44] <Sadale> ah ethernet over coaxial cable.
[19:40:00] <MootPoot> it would cost me more to actually wire eithernet down there so this is the best option unfortunately
[19:40:11] <Sadale> MootPoot, I'm thinking if there could be a better solution tho.
[19:40:14] <Sadale> MootPoot, like a cheaper solution.
[19:40:22] <MootPoot> Ive tried powerline - its shit
[19:40:32] <MootPoot> wifi repeaters are okay...but not ideal
[19:40:37] <MootPoot> I get only 50mbit down there
[19:40:55] <Sadale> MootPoot, Could using normal ethernet cable work? If it's too long, maybe you could put multiple ethernet switches in between.
[19:40:59] <MootPoot> its 3 floors with zigzag cables
[19:41:07] <MootPoot> so wiring that through the walls
[19:41:20] <zoidberg> you could make an access point +mini server with rpi
[19:41:22] <MootPoot> by the time I'm done getting all the tools and the extenders and the switches
[19:41:33] <MootPoot> I'll arleady be in teh 150+ range
[19:41:39] <MootPoot> which at point just get MoCa
[19:41:42] <Sadale> ah
[19:41:59] <MootPoot> zoidberg: the point is to get gigabit or more down there
[19:42:07] <MootPoot> rpi wifi AP can't do that
[19:42:08] <MootPoot> lol
[19:43:14] <Sadale> MootPoot, so your house's three-floors? :O
[19:43:16] <Sadale> rich.
[19:43:22] <zoidberg> ah, I thought you'd move your existing connection down
[19:43:33] <MootPoot> I dont regret the wifi repeater since I needed it anyway to get internet in the garage
[19:43:47] <MootPoot> Sadale: well...technically - its 4 
[19:43:55] <MootPoot> lots of stairs
[19:44:00] <Sadale> MootPoot, rich.
[19:44:03] * Sadale poor
[19:44:04] <MootPoot> lol
[19:44:14] <ButterNoodle> no fuckin elevator?? u poor as shit MootPoot
[19:44:16] * Sadale apartment 30m-sq 4 persons :<
[19:44:23] <MootPoot> its in a crowded area so we built up instead of out
[19:44:34] <MootPoot> that's what houses are like here
[19:44:49] <MootPoot> so overall area is probably as much as your average 2 floor home
[19:44:53] <ButterNoodle> Sadale: ur 30sq is probably as much as my house payment
[19:45:45] <zoidberg> ButterNoodle: how big is your home?
[19:45:56] <ButterNoodle> 130sqm
[19:46:07] <zoidberg> is it one of those typical American houses with lawn and stuff?
[19:46:13] <ButterNoodle> yea
[19:46:21] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, probably. Just checked. It's about $650k.
[19:46:35] <ButterNoodle> holy shit
[19:46:37] <Sadale> It's bullshit. 30sq-m for $650k. :<
[19:46:43] <MootPoot> do you come out in the morning every day with ur cock hanging out to yell at the kids to get off your lawn ButterNoodle 
[19:46:45] <Sadale> Like why the fuck I even want to get housing here.
[19:46:46] <MootPoot> Sadale: rich
[19:46:57] <Sadale> MootPoot, not my money. That's my parent's
[19:47:04] <ButterNoodle> my house with 1200sqm lot is barely worth 180K

[19:47:57] <Sadale> You get far more bang for your buck.
[19:48:05] <MootPoot> Okii ochinchin
[19:48:07] <ButterNoodle> cost of living space
[19:48:14] <TsundereNoises> not living in a city has downsides too though

[19:48:26] <ButterNoodle> fucking driving
[19:48:28] <ButterNoodle> car culture
[19:48:37] <zoidberg> ButterNoodle: 1200 Sqmt?!!
[19:48:41] <TsundereNoises> like if you got a house in New York City it would also cost a fortune for a small apartment
[19:48:48] <ButterNoodle> ofc there are few cities in america that u can rely on public transit
[19:48:49] <TsundereNoises> also food!
[19:48:55] <ButterNoodle> zoidberg: yea the lot size
[19:48:58] <TsundereNoises> you're much more limited on restaurants
[19:49:08] <TsundereNoises> in a HUGE way
[19:49:14] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: yea a 30 min drive to get anywhere decent
[19:49:27] <TsundereNoises> also things like plays and concerts and even movies if you like non-disney movies
[19:49:33] <ButterNoodle> but all the fast food is out in the cuntry now
[19:49:51] <ButterNoodle> I have all the regular fare within a mile
[19:49:58] <zoidberg> ButterNoodle: damn that's a huge lot, why is the house so small compared to lot?
[19:49:59] <ButterNoodle> but 20 min to get anything decent
[19:50:14] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: yeah and even then, when I lived in a city there were really great versions of every kind of cuisine, here I can get okay Italian or American and acceptable Indian if I want to drive an hour
[19:50:18] <TsundereNoises> but good Thai is like 2 hours
[19:50:28] <ButterNoodle> zoidberg: we dont build to the edges of the property :)
[19:50:33] <TsundereNoises> good Mexican is further, who knows where
[19:51:07] <zoidberg> ButterNoodle: we have those norms here too but not that much though
[19:51:07] <ButterNoodle> lucky I have interstate close and can get to louisville in less than 30 min

[19:51:27] <TsundereNoises> yeah, you're better off
[19:51:36] <ButterNoodle> zoidberg: I want little house on big lot
[19:51:38] <TsundereNoises> I think that's the sweet spot, not being in a real city, but being sort of near one

[20:00:37] <ImoutoBot> zoidberg: Quote added for ButterNoodle (491)
[20:00:38] <TsundereNoises> it's just weird it's not low, I don't know how you can get a forest fire once you have a certain amount of snow on the trees
[20:00:52] <TsundereNoises> seems like nature's sprinkler system
[20:01:13] <DunceCotus> TsundereNoises: fire doesn't care about snow
[20:01:25] <TsundereNoises> when snow gets hot it turns into water
[20:01:25] <DunceCotus> its just can't swallow liquids 
[20:01:28] <TsundereNoises> science fact
[20:02:07] <zoidberg> TsundereNoises: no way!
[20:02:14] <zoidberg> you're blowing my mind
[20:02:39] <DunceCotus> when snow superheats the water phases into a volatile form of matter called "hot cold ice".. from there all sorts of firey mayhem is expected
[20:02:49] <TsundereNoises> anyway the biggest fire within hundreds of miles of me in the last like 100 years was tiny in comparison to any given year in California, much less one of the really big ones
[20:03:49] <TsundereNoises> precipitation power, baby
[20:04:08] <emmeka> we had a big forest fire get 15km from my property line 4 years ago
[20:04:26] <TsundereNoises> was there a lot of snow on the ground?
[20:04:31] *** Quits: DunceCotus (~DunceCotu@user/duncecotus) (Quit: Leaving)
[20:04:39] <emmeka> it was in summer
[20:04:46] <emmeka> it rained ash from the sky and the air was hazy and burned your eyes for weeks
[20:05:05] <emmeka> but this is a consequence of life in the boreal forest, where the fire cycles are rapid
[20:05:21] <zoidberg> that's harsh emmeka

[20:05:31] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Kaginado | Episode: 8
[20:06:10] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: my original comment was just that I find it weird when I see the Smokey the Bear sign saying "Fire Danger: Moderate" covered in snow
[20:06:15] <TsundereNoises> I suspect it should say "Low"
[20:06:24] <TsundereNoises> but maybe they don't actually have a low setting
[20:06:47] <Urchin[emacs]> things just being cold aren't enough to stop a fire
[20:07:11] <TsundereNoises> again, it's not the cold, it's the amount of solid water ready to melt that I'm thinking of
[20:07:32] <TsundereNoises> snow is not particularly flamable
[20:07:39] <HeTo> last summer we had simultaneous forest fire and heavy rain warnings
[20:09:02] <TsundereNoises> I feel like I make a (to me) funny observation about weird government signage and everyone falls all over themselves trying to stretch logic to justify it
[20:09:07] <TsundereNoises> y'all are weird
[20:09:43] <emmeka> in these parts forest fires have their own hotline to call instead of 911, that's how usual it is. we gets hundreds in a given summer.
[20:10:01] <TsundereNoises> much drier up there I guess
[20:10:37] <emmeka> a bit drier, but also with forests more adapted to burning and less firebreaks
[20:11:18] <TsundereNoises> grammar nazi mode: FEWER firebreaks
[20:11:19] <emmeka> most of the key species of the boreal forest actually require fire to regenerate. the jack pine has a flammable coating that prevents its cones from opening, they have to burn to release the seeds
[20:11:30] <zoidberg> the future generations will have it much hard
[20:12:06] <zoidberg> oh

[21:42:26] <ImoutoBot> mixfix41: Traditionally, a delicatessen or "deli" is a retail establishment that sells a selection of fine, exotic, or foreign prepared foods. Delicatessen originated in Germany during the 18th century and spread to the United States in the mid-19th century.
[21:43:36] <TsundereNoises> not as fancy as that definition makes it sound
[21:43:55] <mixfix41> !c fiber
[21:43:56] <ImoutoBot> mixfix41: Dietary fiber or roughage is the portion of plant-derived food that cannot be completely broken down by human digestive enzymes. Dietary fibers are diverse in chemical composition, and can be grouped generally by their solubility, viscosity, and fermentability, which affect how fibers are processed in the body.
[21:44:06] <mixfix41> this one too ^^ its a conspiracy
[21:44:30] <mixfix41> !c conifer
[21:44:31] <ImoutoBot> mixfix41: Conifers are a group of cone-bearing seed plants, a subset of gymnosperms. Scientifically, they make up the division Pinophyta, also known as Coniferophyta or Coniferae. The division contains a single extant class, Pinopsida. All extant conifers are perennial woody plants with secondary growth.
[21:44:32] <TsundereNoises> I mean even real dictionaries have a tendency to awkward definitions

[22:07:35] <MootPoot> probably best to put it into student loan instead
[22:09:07] <MootPoot> its funny how some dumb RGB is cheaper then getting an actual lava lamp
[22:10:49] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I'm sorry, once you've gone tsundere there's no going back
[22:10:56] <TsundereNoises> You can only hope for brief moments of deredere
[22:11:21] <TsundereNoises> also you could just get a lava lamp
[22:11:25] <TsundereNoises> I guess
[22:11:44] <TsundereNoises> or like colorful christmas lights, pretend you're a college student
[22:12:00] <MootPoot> Problem with the lava lamp ..it costs as much as this for only one

[22:12:32] <MootPoot> Apparently not 
[22:13:27] <TsundereNoises> I didn't even know you could buy lava lamps, I thought they all came from garage sales
[22:14:00] <TsundereNoises> there was never an original lava lamp, they just spontaneously started appearing at garage sales in the 70s
[22:14:04] <MootPoot> 4 800 lumen RGB bars which are BT only = 140
[22:14:22] <MootPoot> I could get some normal RGB bulbs and lamps but that's like 80 bucks 
[22:14:40] <MootPoot> Or lava lamp= 25 a pop
[22:16:10] <MootPoot> ... apparently they are shit from the factory and you have to "upgrade" them
