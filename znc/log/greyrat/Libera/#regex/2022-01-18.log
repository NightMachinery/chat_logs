[18:51:43] <mysticspiral[m]> at the end you want two different capture groups (fixed and base) and they shall contain the dollar value only if base compensation respectively fixed rate are found in the line?

[22:22:52] <cko> Hey all. I am trying to write a regex that will capture escaped strings from lua.`|c` is used to color text. it is followed by 8 characters [a-f0-9] that indicate the alpha, r, g and b of the color desired. The anything after that would be the text that is colored followed by a |r to stop coloring any text after. However, |c can be chained to
[22:22:53] <cko> alternate colors easily but must end with a |r. https://regex101.com/r/rwpWnZ/2

[22:44:23] <OnlineCop> cko: If a user wants a literal '|' character, how does that get represented?
[22:45:02] <OnlineCop> Some languages escape the delimiter, so `\|`. Others (like CSV) double the character: `||`
[22:46:08] <OnlineCop> I would avoid all use of `.` if possible: `.*` and `.*?`
[22:48:24] <mysticspiral[m]> how about this for a start? https://regex101.com/r/rwpWnZ/5
[22:51:41] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/rwpWnZ/6
[22:51:58] <cko> Calling a literal | would be ||
[22:56:07] <cko> This page my help with how they are used. https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/UI_escape_sequences
[22:56:14] <OnlineCop> Okay, so encountering `||` would just be part of the "more text", and it's perfectly acceptable for the literal text to be the following? "|cff000000"
[22:56:52] <OnlineCop> That is: "asdf|cffA236EF||cff000000|r"
[22:58:54] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/rwpWnZ/7
[23:01:17] <mysticspiral[m]> cko: i understood it like this that you also want the last line to match
[23:01:25] <mysticspiral[m]> "|cff9900ffWeakAuras:|ss||r "
[23:01:42] <cko> "|" followed by something that is not a valid escape sequence will be displayed as-is or is otherwise undefined behavior.
[23:01:43] <OnlineCop> Why would the `|ss|` match?
[23:02:29] <OnlineCop> Okay, so since `|c...` and `|r` are both valid escape sequences, they require `||` to be used, but any other `|ss...` sequence should be allowed?
[23:04:13] <mysticspiral[m]> https://regex101.com/r/4LcQ1s/1
[23:04:30] <cko> If you want to print a literal `|`, you have to use `||`. For the sake of this request there are only 3 valid ways to use `|`. Those are `|c`, `|r` and `||`
[23:06:39] <OnlineCop> cko, on that last line  "|cff9900ffWeak||Auras:|ss||r "  should the "|ss" match?
[23:06:44] <mysticspiral[m]> sorry forgot about that the 2nd line may not match
[23:06:46] <cko> `|ss|` would not match.

[23:15:25] <mysticspiral[m]> cko: i dont get why it should not match. its part of the string and not of any escaping sequence
[23:16:13] <cko> It would need to be `||ss||`
[23:16:53] <OnlineCop> Are either of these latest two links matching what you want it to match?
[23:18:25] <cko> https://regex101.com/r/4LcQ1s/1 works outside of it selecting `|ss|` but that is not a big deal.
[23:19:26] <cko> The goal of this is to use it to generate tooltips in vscode https://imgur.com/a/c9Qc2T3
[23:19:31] <OnlineCop> What about revision /7 above?
[23:19:33] <cko> An example of what I have so far.
[23:20:28] <cko> 7 is actually a bit better as the second example on the list should not match
[23:20:33] <cko> since it doesnt end with a `|r`
[23:21:06] <OnlineCop> Do you want the `|r` to match as well?
[23:21:15] <OnlineCop> So that it gets replaced with "nothing"?
[23:21:42] <mysticspiral[m]> this is what i got now
[23:21:43] <mysticspiral[m]> https://regex101.com/r/4LcQ1s/2
[23:22:29] <OnlineCop> mysticspiral[m]: I think for the last line to match, "|cff9900ffWeak||Auras:|ss||r " should actually be "|cff9900ffWeak||Auras:||ss|||r "
[23:22:40] <cko> `|r` would not need to be part of the capture group as I am currently replacing `|r` after.
[23:22:56] <OnlineCop> That is, the `|` before and after `ss` should be literal characters so therefore the string should use `||` to represent a literal pipe character.
[23:23:07] <AhmedAmerican> how to match all what between `[]` https://regex101.com/r/AzQcvc/1
[23:24:12] <OnlineCop> cko: In version /7, the `(?<="[^\n"]*)` at the beginning is probably not necessary (and just takes extra computation), if you're validating other stuff before that point anyway.

[23:28:38] <OnlineCop> AhmedAmerican: Since that outer '[' contains a nested '[]' within it, you're going to need recursion. Python's `re` module doesn't support it, but Python's `regex` module (from pypi) does. It then supports PCRE notation, which includes recursion.
[23:29:19] <AhmedAmerican> got it
[23:31:31] <OnlineCop> AhmedAmerican: It looks like that large [...] block is all contained on the next line. You COULD just match the entire line.

[23:36:19] <AhmedAmerican> it should end on `}]`
[23:36:22] <OnlineCop> I got rid of the `/s` flag, since you don't actually want `.+` to go to the end of the entire file, just to the end of the line.
[23:37:18] <OnlineCop> Then modify it to specify that: `(\[.+\}\])`
[23:37:24] <OnlineCop> Instead of `(\[.+\])`

[23:37:55] <AhmedAmerican> thanks a lot
[23:38:12] <cko> Doing a straight replace if `|r` after regex is silly when I can just do it here with a sub already.

[23:39:04] <OnlineCop> AhmedAmerican: My pleasure.
[23:40:21] <cko> The strings its running against will never be long as they are filtered out ahead of this.
[23:41:44] <OnlineCop> cko: If you're not planning to use the contents of the `(\|r)?` group, you could use a non-capturing group: `(?:\|r)?`
[23:42:11] <cko> Ahh you are right. Thank you.
[23:42:44] <cko> Going to take some time and make a few test cases so I dont confuse everyone if I have to ask questions later.
[23:42:48] <OnlineCop> Okay, next question: handling `"` literals.
[23:42:59] <OnlineCop> Would those be escaped as `\"` ?
[23:44:28] <cko> Yea, `"` would be `\"`
[23:45:05] <OnlineCop> Any other edge cases?
[23:45:43] <OnlineCop> What happens if it encounters `\|` for example?
[23:45:54] <cko> Not that I can think of off the top of my head but I am going to that regex over about 20k precaptured strings to see if any come up
[23:46:14] <cko> `\|` would be invalid.
[23:47:41] <OnlineCop> I usually do a match for /\\./ (that is, a literal `\` followed by an "any character".
[23:48:02] <OnlineCop> If the only character it should allow after a literal `\` is a double quote, I can do that.
