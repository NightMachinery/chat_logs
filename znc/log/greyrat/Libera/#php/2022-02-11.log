[00:26:32] <wfpkhc> anyway onto the scenario
[00:27:17] <wfpkhc> im building a user vs admin panel - i would like the admin to be able to force log out of the user when desired - i have 2 solutions that i have come up with - please hold while i type them out

[00:28:18] <wfpkhc> scenario 1 - when the user logs in, it writes the current session to a account field on the database - and when the admin wants to force logout, it looks at that session id and then forces that specific session to be deleted
[00:28:20] <wfpkhc> or
[00:28:57] <__adrian> while it might be impolite to barge in and "just ask" in in-person social situations, this does not hold true on irc. "just ask" *IS* the polite thing.  :)
[00:29:22] <wfpkhc> scenario 2 - the admin writes the account id that it wants to force logout to a table, and when that user next refreshes the page, the user looks up if his id is in the force logout table and then self logs out
[00:29:48] <da_wunder> 22:34 < da_wunder> don't ask to ask - just ask
[00:30:09] <__adrian> if you're already tracking sessions in the DB, then #1 seems preferable, but there are certainly other options.
[00:31:19] <__adrian> e.g., i've worked with systems that associate the user's login date with the session, and the session can be invalidated by resetting the date the user is "allowed" to login at (i.e., if they're "allowed" to log in _after_ the existing session login date, it means they're logged out)
[00:31:24] <wfpkhc> are you guys giving me permission to be an arrogant linux elitist by just asking a question? https://i.imgur.com/MTdIDJW.png
[00:31:46] <__adrian> wfpkhc: "just ask" *IS* the polite  thing"
[00:32:03] <wfpkhc> thats not a bad idea about the date they are allowed to log in
[00:32:11] <lembron> wfpkhc i write a password_last changed to my users, and store that in the session, if it changed (either cause uer changed pw, or admin forced) all sessions get destroyed as there dates dont match anymore on whats stored
[00:32:17] <Albright> Okay, so first step is to install Gentoo
[00:32:20] <lembron> (as in, dates)
[00:32:20] <__adrian> it's not arrogant or rude. there are different expectations of politeness in chat rooms, etc. vs other situations.
[00:32:49] <wfpkhc>  lembron : ok
[00:32:57] <__adrian> why would we be asking you to be rude to us?
[00:33:07] <wfpkhc> its a joke - relax :D
[00:33:09] <wfpkhc> be happy
[00:33:49] <wfpkhc> so back to the question at hand
[00:34:03] <wfpkhc> no at the moment im not tracking the sessions with the account - i would have to implement that
[00:34:24] <lembron> usecase "here" is rly that "changing your pw will log everyone off" - but forcing that date flip doesnt sound super-terrible... - but destroys the info on when it was actually changed last i guess

[00:45:03] <wfpkhc> im back
[00:45:24] <wfpkhc> sorry about that
[00:45:24] <lembron> wb - once you have the session "kill itself when it tries to resume" things should be pretty fine
[00:45:29] <biberu> wfpkhc: what kind of data is stored in your sessions? why does it matter if they are destroyed?
[00:45:35] <wfpkhc> lembron,  ok
[00:45:44] <wfpkhc> biberu,  there is no date stored in the session
[00:45:51] <biberu> datA
[00:45:59] <wfpkhc> ?
[00:46:06] <biberu> information
[00:46:11] <wfpkhc> ok
[00:46:28] <wfpkhc> the data stored is "is user logged in"
[00:46:30] <lembron> kinda key is that its a lost game to "destroy the session" -- but rather "have the session(your code) notice that this isnt valid anymore..." and bail
[00:46:35] <TML> wfpkhc: generally speaking, most sites don't enforce a "user can only be logged in from one location at a time" rule, so that might be a factor in the question of how you implement this; your first suggestion implicit creates such a restriction
[00:47:01] <biberu> wfpkhc: that's an odd thing to store in a session?
[00:47:02] * wfpkhc waves hello to TML 
[00:47:23] <TML> wfpkhc: more common would be to have a table session (user_id int not null references user(id), session_id <some type depending on your session ID format> not null)
[00:47:26] <wfpkhc> TML,  this is not about "user can only be logged in from one location at a time"
[00:47:33] <TML> wfpkhc: I understand that
[00:47:39] <wfpkhc> this is about getting someone you want out of the sessions - to destroy someone elses session
[00:47:50] <TML> wfpkhc: But your proposed solution #1 ENFORCES such a restriction as a side-effect of the implementation
[00:47:55] <lembron> beeing able to "login multiple times" means you can NOT store a session token "on the user" -- but you can have a sessions table -- if you try todo both "inside the session" is where trouble comes from ;D
[00:48:24] <TML> 👆🏻
[00:48:25] <wfpkhc> biberu, hardly an odd thing - if a server creates a session, that does not mean they have logged in or not logged in
[00:48:48] <TML> wfpkhc: you store sessions for anonymous users?
[00:49:04] * wfpkhc hides under the desk
[00:49:05] <wfpkhc> yes
[00:49:11] <TML> to what end?
[00:49:12] <biberu> wfpkhc: a session should basically be a pointer, if you disable the thing it points to then the session would be disabled too
[00:50:07] <wfpkhc> the purpose of creating a session for each user is for the tracking of each user
[00:50:31] <lembron> (speaking of this "session resume" - its not uncommon todo some more enforcing there... a default cookie is fairly easy to spoof so you often see things like limiting on IP address as additional field ((here with some extra care if you have traveling users, may be  blocks rather than /32´s))
[00:50:53] <wfpkhc> lembron, ok
[00:51:01] <lembron> also think there is some mixing of "php sessions" and "applications login state" going on here... those are fairly distinctive things
[00:51:16] <TML> wfpkhc: But they're not a "user" yet if they're not logged in
[00:52:12] <wfpkhc> tml think in terms of bots - if you see in your page view log that someone is hammering your website, you can use their session id to redirect them to a "naughty, naughty naught dont do that" page
[00:52:42] <wfpkhc> i should learn to spell and grammar check my messages
[00:52:44] <TML> wfpkhc: most bots won't bother to implement sessions IDs
[00:52:44] * wfpkhc sighs
[00:53:22] <wfpkhc> most bots still have IPs with them :D
[00:53:25] <TML> They don't usually pass cookies and what not
[00:54:05] <TML> wfpkhc: Sure…but how is that related to the conversation about sessions for non-authenticated HTTP requests?
[00:54:12] <lembron> "php sessions" are some automagic set/read cookie with a $_SESSION = unserialize(file_get_contents($_COOKIE['SID'])); at the top... for anything "decent" you likely want to start your implementation higher up the chain anyhow...
[00:54:39] <lembron> -> (session cookie everyone gets for storing a/b test decision --- but my looking cookie, https only, no JS access allowed.)
[00:54:52] <wfpkhc> tml they dont - i just dont want to lose the argument!
[00:55:01] <wfpkhc> tehehehe
[00:55:02] <biberu> iirc there was someone a while back who ran into issues because he created new sessions for every request that didn't already have one
[00:55:07] <biberu> was that you wfpkhc?
[00:55:32] <wfpkhc> probably - i have been working on this same website for 22 years - so probably
[00:55:58] <wfpkhc> im getting there - http://wolfpack.network/
[00:56:03] <wfpkhc> =D
[00:56:23] <TML> wfpkhc: *shrug* Storing a server-side session for every HTTP request makes a site much harder to scale in any sensible way, I wouldn't normally recommend it.
[00:56:27] *** Quits: magla (~gelignite@55d43657.access.ecotel.net) (Quit: Stay safe!)
[00:57:02] <wfpkhc> tml that one doesnt make sense, why would you have problems scaling it? if the sessions are all stored in a database?
[00:57:27] <wfpkhc> and yes
[00:57:31] <wfpkhc> they are stored in a database
[00:57:31] <TML> wfpkhc: you want to move every request you possibly can to be a read-only request that delivers a static asset
[00:57:35] <lembron> unless you configured smth else, session_start writes on disk
[00:57:37] <wfpkhc> becuause i wrote a custom session handler
[00:57:59] <lembron> hence asking if you are throwing "sessions" and "application states" and "cookies" in the same bucket
[00:58:05] <TML> wfpkhc: Every time you turn a request into something with write-concerns, you create barriers to scaling
[00:58:18] <wfpkhc> tml - how so?
[00:59:34] <TML> wfpkhc: It's trivial to scale a read-only, completely static HTTP requests to a billion concurrent users; it's almost impossible to scale a write-heavy, session-managed request beyond 100k concurrent users
[00:59:54] <wfpkhc> even with modular hardware?
[01:00:11] <TML> I have no idea what you mean by "modular hardware"
[01:00:32] <wfpkhc> for example: in its current state you have 1 server that has the database installed and the web server installed on the one box
[01:00:35] <lembron> reading you can always just clone (and on outdated clones, ask the master) -- for writing, you either have to shard, offset, have writegroups or other spooky things
[01:01:01] <lembron> master-master aint no fun i tell ya :D
[01:01:02] <wfpkhc> but when you reach your 100K users per second, you would just move the database to a dedicated box and add multiple web server boxes
[01:01:38] <TML> wfpkhc: You're going to have financial problems building a database server that can readily handle 100k concurrent write sessions
[01:01:43] <biberu> wfpkhc: even if you could, why would you want to pay for that?

[01:02:21] <TML> wfpkhc: Unless you have the resources of a small Fortune 1000 or large government, yes
[01:03:03] <wfpkhc> i hardly think that 3 boxes - at $1000 bucks each a year is "small fortune 1000" company

[01:03:22] <wfpkhc> i pay 700 for a year on my box
[01:03:23] <lembron> do you think google drive runs on 3 boxes?
[01:03:31] <TML> wfpkhc: I am 100% confident that "3 boxes at $1000 bucks each year" isn't going to support 100k concurrent writes
[01:03:49] <TML> wfpkhc: You're talking more like Oracle ExaServer hardware

[01:04:13] <biberu> but, why?
[01:04:17] <wfpkhc> but that was about 8 years ago
[01:04:27] <biberu> you're starting sessions you don't need, but still have to pay for
[01:04:39] <biberu> if you can or not seems completely uninteresting
[01:04:45] * da_wunder and it looks like I have ignored that nick for some reason...
[01:04:59] <wfpkhc> i know
[01:05:05] <wfpkhc> i would like to get back to the original question
[01:05:56] <wfpkhc> so - storing the session id
[01:05:57] <lembron> your originial Q has been answerd in length - you dont destroy sessions, you make them sodoku when resumed - how precisely you do that is up to your likings
[01:06:04] <wfpkhc> ok
[01:06:14] <TML> lembron: "you make them sudoku"?
[01:07:00] <lembron> https://i.imgur.com/AAbcITo.png
[01:07:02] <TML> wfpkhc: normally, you would have a table with the pair (user_id, session_id), and a referential trigger between the user IDs, so that when a user is deleted, all their sessions go bye-bye
[01:07:27] <wfpkhc> yes i have that TML -
[01:07:30] <wfpkhc> but i have a time
[01:07:39] <wfpkhc> session, data, expiry time
[01:07:46] <wfpkhc> in the custom session handler
[01:08:11] <wfpkhc> and the 2 scenarios
[01:08:21] <wfpkhc> as explained earlier
[01:08:29] <TML> I don't understand what you're trying to say there, but OK
[01:08:41] <wfpkhc> i can either store the current session with the account information - and then just delete that session id from the session table
[01:08:42] <wfpkhc> or
[01:09:11] <wfpkhc> i create a "force logout" table and then the user refreshes the page, the user auto logs themself out
[01:09:33] <lembron> if your session table "otherwisse" has no user - how do you know whos who even? ;-)
[01:09:46] <wfpkhc> thats sessions thats not accounts table
[01:09:54] <wfpkhc> 2 tables - 1 accounts
[01:09:57] <wfpkhc> 2 sessions
[01:10:47] <lembron> as said above, thats what it should be anyhow you want to allow "multiple logins"
[01:11:26] <wfpkhc> so your saying it should be banned based on account id - rather than session
[01:11:48] <TML> No
[01:11:50] <wfpkhc> thats a good point
[01:11:52] <wfpkhc> what?
[01:12:03] <lembron> so, (uid,pass,session) VS (uid,pass) (uid,session) --- case a scamble field, case b delete - not rly seeing the issue...
[01:12:05] <wfpkhc> if a person is logged into multiple machiens he will have multiple accounts
[01:12:15] <TML> No
[01:12:27] <TML> He would have one account and be logged into that one account multiple times
[01:12:27] <wfpkhc> if a person is logged into multiple machiens he will have multiple sessions*
[01:12:30] <wfpkhc> sorry my bad
[01:13:02] <lembron> he may very well have multiple session (as he should, logins shouldnt share the cookie value) yep^^
[01:13:26] <wfpkhc> ok that did clear something up on my logic - thats why i came here - IT HAS TO BE based on account id
[01:13:50] <wfpkhc> because if they are on multiple devices if you only delete a sessions - other devices can still access the website
[01:13:56] <wfpkhc> that makes sense
[01:14:01] <lembron> ill ask again - if you dont save it with an account ID - how would anything knwo what account you want to be in? im a bit lost there :D

[01:18:51] <wfpkhc> to me "delete data" is very open ended - when i spoke to the people in postgre - they said NEVER delete data - only flag it as deleted - but i personally like "flagging" as deleted and "overwriting" the data if it has to be permanently deleted because the user or laws enforce that
[01:18:57] <TML> The database should be enforcing referential integrity on your behalf, it's not your job to get that right
[01:19:46] <TML> I can't even fathom the defense for the stance of "NEVER delete data"
[01:20:33] <wfpkhc> TML - i could be wrong but if you delete a row from a  1-MM-1 table the database will throw an error and you have to handle that
[01:21:04] * wfpkhc wishes he would pit TML against RhodiumToad
[01:21:07] <TML> "You know what's awesome? Having 230 yottabytes of data that has no meaning to me anymore"
[01:21:15] <lembron> its a true and a false - and a depends on a) who you talk with and b) what about... - yes, often a "delete" actually means "stop displaying", but if something "shall be deleted" thats 'so its not there anymore' what sounds oddly the same, while beeing verrrry different if messed up :D
[01:21:21] <wfpkhc> he is a cool guy that helps wiht postgre stuff - he is cool
[01:21:44] * wfpkhc goes pale at the thought of a yottabytes
[01:21:59] <biberu> TML: and that may be illegal...
[01:22:06] <wfpkhc> lembron, yup
[01:22:26] <TML> wfpkhc: What is a "1-MM-1 table"?
[01:22:27] <wfpkhc> biberu, well illegal - in some european countries its mandatory by law
[01:23:35] <biberu> i don't know where your from or what kind of data you're storing
[01:23:42] <wfpkhc> 1-MM-1 examples   Account(pkid, name)   games(pkid, name)   UserGames(FKID_account, fkid_game)
[01:23:47] <TML> wfpkhc: I think that biberu is alluding to things like the GDPR, which says you MUST delete if the user requests it; but you said you "overwrite". Why you'd want to keep storing those bytes long after they stopped being sensible is beyond me.
[01:24:09] <biberu> you're
[01:25:27] <lembron> GDPR deletions are an extra fun one :D
[01:25:31] <wfpkhc> if you delete an account row - you have to make sure all the rows in usergames are deleted as well or ref interity will be destroyed
[01:25:46] <wfpkhc> i dont know what GDPR deletions are
[01:25:48] <__adrian> yes of course?
[01:26:02] <TML> wfpkhc: That's my point - if YOU have to make sure the rows are deleted, you're DOING DATABASES WRONG
[01:26:11] <__adrian> if you don't know what GDPR is then you'd better make sure you turn off your website in the EU.
[01:26:13] <TML> The database should be doing that for you
[01:26:25] <wfpkhc> im not in the EU im in Australia
[01:26:37] <__adrian> "your website"
[01:26:43] <__adrian> it doesn't matter where YOU are.
[01:27:11] <wfpkhc> yeah well, we could argue the website is in Australia, and the EU person came to Australia
[01:27:20] <wfpkhc> so they are under AU law
[01:27:25] <wfpkhc> not EU policy
[01:27:59] <biberu> my point has nothing to do with s specific law
[01:28:06] <wfpkhc> yup
[01:28:29] <biberu> it's up to you to check what laws you have to adhere to, i'm just raising the issue that a flag may not be enough
[01:28:38] <wfpkhc> tml - thats my point - you would still have to delete the data from the MM table
[01:29:06] <wfpkhc> but until your telling the sql to delete on cascade or something similar (im now straying outside my area of knowledge)
[01:29:32] <lembron> if its anything commercial youll prob have to care sooner or later - just ask the Zuck ;-) - for your random blog.au domain, ye prob noone gives a s. :P
[01:29:32] <wfpkhc> biberu,  in my personal experience though
[01:29:46] <TML> wfpkhc: Yes, that's the whole point of referential integrity
[01:29:48] <wfpkhc> most websites dont go over 50,000 rows
[01:29:53] <TML> That the database makes sure it's enforced
[01:30:42] * wfpkhc mumbles not so nice things under his voice at lembron and his zuck comment*
[01:31:06] <wfpkhc> ok well thank you all for the conversation

[01:50:57] <BadAdviceCat> TML, lol, yeah. So basically this is a topic about delete versus soft deleting. And also not knowing how to set up cascade deletes properly, or at the very least have the software be aware of deleting all relations.
[01:51:20] <TML> yes
[01:52:58] *** Joins: delboy1978uk (~delboy197@d51a4773c.access.telenet.be)
[01:55:52] <BadAdviceCat> I find it odd that anyone in #postgres would say that. There had to be context around it. I've only seen soft-deletion only being a good idea (back when the idea was new-ish, I'm not talking about present times)  when it's necessary to prevent accidental or malicious deletion.
[01:56:04] <BadAdviceCat> #postgresql*
[01:58:26] <BadAdviceCat> And another practice is to actually delete, but keep the rows in tact, possibly with a flag to say "content deleted" or some default message so that people are aware  that content got deleted and the conversation in between would appear less awkward. Also to allow subthreads and replies to appear where it needs to be.

[05:18:23] <Albright> So my client is having me work on an integration with a service called IDology where you pass them some data on someone signing up and they return a reputational score (like how likely it is to be a real human being who they say they are)
[05:18:54] <Albright> Points of data we could send include name, address, SSN,DOB, phone number, email address…
[05:19:07] <Albright> Their API requires that all of this data is sent AS GET PARAMETERS.
[05:19:51] <Albright> How do you be this dumbfuck?
[05:20:12] <Blondie101010> what's your concern with that?
[05:20:16] <Albright> How was nobody involved with the creation of this rather complex service being like "um hold on"
[05:21:04] <Blondie101010> GET is not less secure than POST
[05:21:05] <Albright> Blondie101010: The URL of a request is not encrypted and might be stored and logged by whatever servers your request passes through.
[05:21:10] <Blondie101010> wrong
[05:21:16] <Blondie101010> only the hostname is not encrypted
[05:21:17] <Albright> How?
[05:21:47] <Blondie101010> read on SNI
[05:23:08] <Blondie101010> one of the first steps of a HTTPS exchange is SNI, then everything else is encrypted
[05:23:28] <Albright> Shit, I stand corrected, I guess.
[05:23:49] <Albright> I always thought only the HTTP body was encrypted and headers were not.
[05:24:01] <__adrian> that used-to-be if i recall correctly
[05:24:30] <Blondie101010> well SNI is not as old as HTTPS
[05:24:56] <Albright> Well, then, I guess my only objection is that packing all this data in a URL is still kinda gross. Not sure why they didn't just make it a POST.
[05:25:18] <__adrian> oh i missed that part  :p
[05:25:26] <__adrian> yeah, that's a big WTF.
[05:25:30] <Blondie101010> Albright:  you should ask them...  they may have a good reason, or not
[05:26:05] <__adrian> definitely worth making sure, if you're sending SSNs
[05:26:06] <Blondie101010> based on the service, I wonder if they intentionally want to receive direct requests
[05:26:36] <Blondie101010> well sharing those details seems touchy, especially with GDPR

[15:43:55] <grandfso_> Hi, I have a script that I purchased. I would like to add some customization to it, but I would like to keep the 'base' unchanged so that if the script is updated, my customization will not be lost. How would you approach such issue? I was thinking of applyting the changes with ansible, but this seems like an overkill. any ideas?
[15:44:48] <grandfso_> saying script I mean 'php + js + html + css'
[15:45:25] <grandfso_> applying*
[15:46:48] <Naktibalda> you could use git branches, keep original version in one branch, apply changes on another, and then rebase after updating original branch
[15:47:50] <Naktibalda> git can remember how to resolve merge conflicts if you have the same conflicts every time: https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rerere
[15:48:24] <stenno> yeah sounds like a job for VCS
[15:50:40] <grandfso_> Naktibalda: right, thanks for pointing this out. Didn't come to mind as I don't  know git very well. Finally a need to learn more of git.

[19:24:38] <AllenJB> Consider if you even need to use references. If you're doing it purely for memory optimization it's usually unneeded - PHP uses copy-on-write for arrays, so multiple "copies" of an array do not consume more memory until you modify one. Objects are effectively always passed-by-reference.

[20:18:24] <DevAntoine> Naktibalda: yeah I might have taken the issue in the wrong way
[20:18:48] <DevAntoine> But how can I know if all my packages are compatible with PHP 8.1 without doing "composer info package" package by package?
[20:18:50] <DevAntoine> FightingFalcon: yes

[21:36:20] <TML> Northwoods: Usually that error means either you have dynmically loaded the extension twice, or that you've dynamically loaded an extension which is already compiled statically into your php binary
[21:37:10] <Northwoods> yes they are being loaded twice
[21:37:30] <Northwoods> i think once through conf.d folder and once in php.ini
[21:37:49] <TML> We know they're being loaded twice - I'm saying the two most common causes of being loaded twice is "I did it dynamically twice" or "I did it once statically and once dynamically"
[21:37:50] <Northwoods> are the once that are in php.ini dynamic ones ?
[21:38:36] <TML> Northwoods: One possible way to accidentally load an extension dynamically twice is to instruct PHP to scan a folder of INIs and then also explicitly include those INIs in your config
[21:39:27] <Northwoods> TML, this is exactly what is happeining
[21:39:34] <Northwoods> php is scanning conf.d folder
[21:39:41] <Northwoods> https://ibb.co/3N73RXz
[21:40:03] <Northwoods> how can i instrruct php not to scan that folder
[21:42:29] <Naktibalda> I think that it is more correct to remove module configuration from php.ini
[21:43:00] <TML> Northwoods: You generally don't want to instruct it not to do that
[21:43:13] <TML> Your distribution vendor instructed it to do that on purpose
[21:43:16] <Northwoods> Naktibalda, yes thats what i did so far
