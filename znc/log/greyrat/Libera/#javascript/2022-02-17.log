[02:06:01] <ljharb> onosendi: no, unless i override it with a bunch of version scripts
[02:06:09] <ljharb> onosendi: and no, i can't test it locally
[02:06:14] <ljharb> (actions i mean)
[02:07:46] <jaawerth> twiclo: what do you mean by pass? typically the function would just grab the value from event.currentTarget, unless you mean you're wrapping some other funtion. if you mean it's an inline listener rather tahn a function, then my advice is "don't"
[02:09:57] <twiclo> onchange="myfunction(this)"
[02:10:09] <jaawerth> ah. yes, that is my "don't"

[02:10:20] <jaawerth> !inline
[02:10:21] <jellobot> jaawerth, Inline event handlers are essentially `eval` inside HTML markup - they're bad practice and result in poorly factored, hard-to-manage code. Seriously consider attaching your events with JavaScript, instead, eg: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener
[02:11:13] <twiclo> If I wanted to do that I'd have to first do a findElementById() right?

[02:20:05] <twiclo> This is a problem because this element doesn't always exist on the dom
[02:20:17] <twiclo> So I guess I have to query for it and add the listener every time I add it?
[02:20:40] <onosendi> twiclo: yes, when you add the element to the DOM, attach the event listener.
[02:21:11] <jaawerth> usually you'd just have that be part of the function adding it to the DOM
[02:21:17] <onosendi> Yeah, indeed.

[02:22:17] <jaawerth> twiclo: to answer your earlier question, the inline event handleres are eval'd in global scope so other thn `this` I *think* therels an auto-bound 'event' variable (it's been a long timem since I've used one and even MDN mostly just goes on about how you shouldn't do it these days), and other thn that you're limited to globals
[02:22:42] <jaawerth> that's another benefit of addEventLister since you can just use closures to embed whatever valeus you want

[03:36:09] <onosendi> dimi1947: did you forget to save your fiddle? All I see is `_this.emitter.trigger('pointerdown', pev);`
[03:36:11] <banana_> well thanks for anyone that read that, I guess my simpler question is what do you call a function that returns an object instance, like some, business domain term, javascript object
[03:36:13] <banana_> ?
[03:36:32] <Decker> factory?
[03:36:40] <banana_> oh ok a factory function?
[03:36:55] <banana_> I got high order function on here wrong so just wondering about that too
[03:37:13] <banana_> not high order functions, I mean this time factory functions I guess
[03:37:29] <dimi1947> ononsendi:I think suffices...I just did not post more for simplisity...but if you want...no problem,,,I can add more code
[03:37:38] <banana_> if that's generally what they're called functions that return a new instance of some javascript object
[03:38:26] <banana_> I'll roll with it, so basically my original question I think is an issue because my factory function isn't abstract enough

The feeling I get about working with js is that you have to hodge-podge all kind of things together to get everything you need in a project. I don't recall what they named it in laravel but it had a kind of command line where you could issue commands to create different parts of the project (types of things
[04:00:02] <blahboybaz> involded in an mvc project) and it would create the files for you and use the name you gave in the command as part of the code in the file as well as orgainize the files (it had its own directory structure). When you would issue the commands to create different types of things you would just write the command hit enter and it would put the files with the names you gave it in the right directories

[04:03:18] <KevinX> Actually, Laravel just released a starter for nextJS + Laravel if you want to mix things together
[04:03:25] <blahboybaz> to start a project you could just issue a command on the coammand line with the name of the project and next you know you have the whole structure of the project created for you

[04:06:18] <KevinX> Ill find the nextjs demo video
[04:06:34] <KevinX> it's new and he explains why he added it which is an interesting perspective maybe
[04:06:45] <blahboybaz> oh cool
[04:06:59] <blahboybaz> I'm pulling articles on nextjs but I like videos much better
[04:07:01] <banana_> twiclo: idk maybe that works but here lists that "value" but no doc page yet, so maybe it's newer for the SelectElement class. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLSelectElement#example

[04:08:43] <KevinX> The speaker there, Taylor, is the creator of Laravel
[04:09:24] <blahboybaz> KevinX: Its a video about laravel or about nextjs?
[04:10:05] <KevinX> prefaces the nextJS stuff for about 2 minutes explaining why he wrote the nextJS starter
[04:10:23] <blahboybaz> I see
[04:10:32] <blahboybaz> It's 10 hours long ?
[04:10:35] <blahboybaz> omg!
[04:10:41] <KevinX> tl:dw; he wants to keep laravel relevant and also doens't feel the JS framework options are very mature yet

[04:13:02] <banana_> just the client or the BE as well?
[04:13:15] <KevinX> i agree JS frameworks don't really do full stack very well yet. Like emailing, authentication, console commands (like mentioned above), job queueing, notifications, database migrations, etc
[04:13:28] <KevinX> you're kinda on your own
[04:13:50] <KevinX> As opposed to something like Rails or Laravel that gives you everything out of the box
[04:14:02] <banana_> yea to really take of advantage of javascript stuff you have to know javascript pretty well, which isn't hard to get there imo unless you're one of the top js here maybe

[04:16:51] <banana_> developing is nice and I don't think in a complacency standpoint. you just have to know the language well but once you do you're golden. it's rarer for languages to have breaking changes. relying on framework, in any language is opening yourself to more breaking changes imo
[04:17:15] <banana_> that's my rationalization to learn js pretty well anyway
[04:17:30] <KevinX> you think it isn't hard to learn JS well?
[04:17:32] <banana_> *developing in js is nice
[04:17:52] <onosendi> I like piecing together an application a lot more than an 'all batteries included' solution.
[04:18:14] <banana_> KevinX you know who told me it's easier to learn JS really well and then develop using frameworks/libraries?
[04:18:21] <KevinX> onosendi i like having both options, especially if it's opt in
[04:18:51] <banana_> with all respect GreenJello told me that years ago, I attribute that advice to furthering my career
[04:18:57] <KevinX> banana_ well the issue with learning the framework only is you don't get the fundamentals.

[04:27:23] <banana_> you might be better than me XD
[04:27:37] <banana_> ok then youre probably better than me
[04:28:06] <jaawerth> I get askked to help interview candidates somewhat frequently and for JS I have couple go-to code challenges. In one, I simply sk people to write a function that takes a string and returns a structure that shows the # of occurrences of each word in the string. It has been surprisingly brutal just to solve that, but I also have a couple "extra credit" curveballs. One ofthem isthat I make one of
[04:28:08] <jaawerth> the words "constructor" or "toString." NOBODY has solved it yet, and I've probably use it 8 times by now?
[04:28:50] <jaawerth> which.. is a good indictor of how many people actually knew the depths of how js (specifically prototypes) work
[04:29:19] <banana_> jaawerth lol
[04:29:23] <jaawerth> I didn't think it would be this bad. granted I don't think the recruiters are pulling from the best sources and the jobs themselves aren't the shiniest, but still
[04:29:29] <jaawerth> they pay well!
[04:29:43] <banana_> I would ask you to solve it for me so I could look but if your interviewees are on here haha
[04:29:45] <banana_> probably not
[04:30:04] <banana_> but what if*
[04:30:18] <jaawerth> well if they are they now know what question I am likely to ask so they canf ind the solution if they're motivated, so I don't mind spoiling it
[04:30:36] <jaawerth> but it's better to try it
[04:30:56] <banana_> yeah I guess, what's your reason to ask them that? to see if there's a genuis out there?
[04:31:13] <jaawerth> well, I want to know how deep their js knowledge is

[04:32:17] <KevinX> jaawerth I'd say composition is more popular than inheritance these days
[04:32:35] <jaawerth> yes but no inheritance is used here other than what's already built in
[04:32:51] <jaawerth> and I don't know if I agree - I hate classes and nevertheless find them difficult to avoid
[04:33:04] <banana_> would you use regex, forgot the iterator thing with a regex object, but like basically collect every word with regex in the string and put it in a hashtable and then spit out that hashmap about maybe run arr.length on each hash tale entry
[04:33:07] <jaawerth> well, "hate" is a strong word. I find them distasteful
[04:33:25] <banana_> put each word in a hashtable by it's string key
[04:33:28] <jaawerth> banana_: for which part? the main problem or the curveball?
[04:34:06] <banana_> the question about collecting all the different words in a string and spitting out the different words and the number of occurences

[04:35:44] <KevinX> oop in general is on the way out ;-)
[04:35:49] <jaawerth> ah. then yes, for me I'd just string.split(/\s+/).reduce() since that kind of operation is an idiomatic usecase for reduce, but there are other ways to do it
[04:36:03] <jaawerth> KevinX: like I said, I don't like them but they are unavoidable when you are doing interop with certain things
[04:36:13] <banana_> obviously collisions in the hash table entries would be array values you could .push(...) collisions
[04:36:21] <jaawerth> KevinX: also inheritance has nothing to do with prototypes being the solution to the curveball I mentioned
[04:36:26] <jaawerth> er, rather, the root cause
[04:36:43] <jaawerth> banana_: an object already handles that for you, you don't havev to implement a hash table
[04:37:05] <jaawerth> an object that you mutate enough uses a hash table under the hood and already handles hash collisions
[04:37:44] <jaawerth> the curveball is related to prototypical inheritance collisions, because everything, including plain objects, inherits from Object.prototype
[04:37:56] <jaawerth> and there are 3 clean solutions
[04:38:23] <jaawerth> one that works back to ES3, one that's ES5, and one that's ES6
[04:38:46] <jaawerth> (well, maybe even older than ES3)
[04:38:59] <KevinX> the question is to take a string and find th enumber of occurances?

[04:39:32] <KevinX> isn't it just a simple regex?
[04:39:53] <banana_> jaarweth what about /\b[^\b\s]+?\b/g
[04:39:55] <jaawerth> aggregate the occurrences of each word, yeah (not bothering to handle every punctuation variant and whatnot, ofc). it's a simple aggregation problem. the curveball is that onne of the words in the string is 'constructor'
[04:40:04] <banana_> for the regex in that .split(...)
[04:40:11] <KevinX> 'the cow did the thing'.match(/(the)/g)?.length
[04:40:41] <jaawerth> banana_: the actual regex isn't really the point so I'm generally fine with /\s+/ for the purposes of the exercise

[04:41:24] *** Quits: wroathe (~wroathe@user/wroathe) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[04:41:39] <banana_> so you were saying implement a hashtable using a regular object
[04:42:04] <banana_> but like you would override keys
[04:42:28] <banana_> so use new Map(...) is one
[04:42:40] <jaawerth> that is the best and most modern solution to the prototype curveball
[04:42:49] <jaawerth> well, BEST is a matter of opinion
[04:42:57] <jaawerth> but you can use a plain object too
[04:43:04] <jaawerth> at no point do you have to implement a hashtable by hand
[04:43:24] <banana_> Object.create(null, ...)

[04:45:35] <jaawerth> that one is a pretty deep cut tbh
[04:45:45] <banana_> what do you mean

[05:06:00] <banana_> and you would give them inputStr.split(...).reduce(...) example
[05:06:02] <banana_> yeah
[05:06:02] *** Joins: Arisc (~ckmptnml@189-31-251-104.user3p.brasiltelecom.net.br)
[05:06:11] <jaawerth> no I would never give them that
[05:06:25] <jaawerth> I'm cool with people asking for help but uI want to see how they reason through the problem
[05:06:28] <banana_> just wondering your experience and opinion on helping out a person that's basically asking for that much help
[05:06:30] <jaawerth> I care more about that than the actual solution
[05:06:39] *** Joins: jmdaemon (~jmdaemon@user/jmdaemon)
[05:06:53] <jaawerth> in an interview, that is
[05:07:07] *** Joins: ferdna (~ferdna@user/ferdna)
[05:07:08] <banana_> I swear there's interviewers that wouldn't help the interviewee get past that first step of getting each word into an array
[05:07:24] <jaawerth> oh, just the .split part, yeah I usually tell people if they get stuck on the regex
[05:07:28] *** Quits: kakashiAL (~kakashi@p5dd8ca04.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[05:07:30] <banana_> they would say "welp want the next question?"
[05:08:01] <banana_> ah ok cool to know. might try asking more in interviews in the future
[05:08:01] <jaawerth> but first I would want them to be liek "ok so I split the string ot an array and then....". I want them to be the ones figuring out how to shape and process the data
[05:08:11] <banana_> yep understood
[05:08:25] <jaawerth> well I don't know how representative I am of others. and I also encourage people to use any docs sites they would normally use
[05:08:37] <banana_> so good to break up the problem into steps and figuring out what steps you're comfortable with
[05:09:08] <banana_> oh really so not like a pencil on paper thing
[05:09:34] <jaawerth> nope. I mean these are all virtual
[05:09:39] <jaawerth> because covid
[05:09:52] <jaawerth> I usually have them sole it in some sandbox site or another
[05:10:00] <jaawerth> s/sole/solve/
[05:10:00] <banana_> but post-covid?
[05:10:11] <jaawerth> meh
[05:10:17] <jaawerth> pen and paper has different rule
[05:10:19] <jaawerth> s
[05:10:29] <jaawerth> I don't see much benefit to doing it that way
[05:11:13] <banana_> yeah for sure
[05:11:27] <jaawerth> I'm not dead-set against it but for the problem above I would always do it as live code, given the choice
[05:11:44] <banana_> gave a few interviews and helped out pretty green people, and you can sometimes immediate feel out how good they are in javascript
[05:11:47] *** Quits: admin123 (~harrymore@ool-2f12f5b1.dyn.optonline.net) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[05:12:15] <KevinX> I don't think I would consider Object.create(null) in an interview. I would use Map probably. But if not then I would probably have ended up with acc[current] = (Number.isInteger(acc[current]) || 0) + 1
[05:12:54] <KevinX> so just check if it's a number or otherwise override the prop
[05:12:59] *** Joins: admin123 (~harrymore@ool-2f12f5b1.dyn.optonline.net)
[05:13:21] <jaawerth> yeah that'd be leget too
[05:13:23] <banana_> i think his question you dont have to worry about numbers
[05:13:25] <jaawerth> *legit
[05:13:51] <banana_> maybe wrong about that
[05:14:00] <jaawerth> well you are counting things
[05:14:05] <KevinX> well you're counting. I would have output the code, and see n the string representation of a function and then just checked for it
[05:14:22] <KevinX> Seems like a natural progression though
[05:14:32] <KevinX> Did the applicants just not see the output?
[05:14:39] <jaawerth> no they did
[05:14:49] <KevinX> constructor: "function Object() { [native code] }1"
[05:14:53] <jaawerth> yep
[05:14:58] <banana_> lol
[05:15:05] <KevinX> if they cant see that and figure out what's up then yeah don't hire them
[05:15:10] *** Quits: voltage (voltage@user/voltage) (Quit: Leaving)
[05:15:30] <jaawerth> a couple managed  to hack their way around it
[05:15:32] <banana_> didn't know \w metacharacter in regex also includes numbers, it means any alphanumeric character
[05:15:41] <banana_> whoops
[05:15:41] *** Joins: kakashiAL (~kakashi@p5dd8ca04.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[05:15:46] <jaawerth> but nobody actually solved it in a way that wasn't concerning
[05:15:46] <KevinX> The ol "1" + 1 gotcha
[05:15:59] <jaawerth> one person tried eval
[05:18:02] <banana_> yeah if you said in the interview "what about numbers?" I wouldnt have done it
[05:18:14] *** Quits: admin123 (~harrymore@ool-2f12f5b1.dyn.optonline.net) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[05:20:01] <banana_> or wouldve suggested /\b[^\d\b\s]+?\b/g regex
[05:20:27] <jaawerth> again the regex isn't the point though
[05:20:28] <banana_> isnt there some property names not allowed, forgot the specifics
[05:20:29] <jaawerth> I just want the output

[05:20:57] *** Joins: c4017w__ (~c4017@209.52.68.8)
[05:21:14] <banana_> yea but I guess I dont understand the point of bringing numbers into the answer
[05:21:21] *** Joins: brentaarnold (~brentaarn@24.112.56.42)
[05:21:29] <KevinX> have to count how many occurances
[05:21:49] <KevinX> how many times did the word `the` appear? 5?
[05:21:52] <KevinX> like that
[05:22:40] *** Quits: k8yun (~k8yun@user/k8yun) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[05:22:43] <banana_> but if you have an object as a hash table and an array value for the property-value you could just count the length of the entry's array.
[05:23:20] <jaawerth> either way works, yes. my first thought is numbers are simpler but it would work either way
[05:23:26] <banana_> I guess the array of strings property value is a bit overkill you could just have the property-value a number 1-Infinity
[05:23:27] <jaawerth> I wouldn't care which someone used

[08:09:56] <blahboybaz> So there is some kind of utilities package (it can minify stuff but a whole lot more too) and I thought it was called webkit. Am I mistaking the name? Does anyone know what the name of that might be then?

[09:03:30] <blahboybaz> I'm looking at an example where someone is using tailwindcss with nextjs and they are saying that when you configure tailwindcss in nextjs (using postcss.config.js I guess) that it takes the place of nextjs' native postcss. What I'm wondering is if doing this would somehow quash other features of nextjs that you might not think of (make nextjs impotent in some ways)? What I mean is - are there
[09:03:37] <blahboybaz> features of nextjs that rely on it's native postcss stuff and that would be rendered ineffective if they were disabled?

[12:50:18] <fweht> i just wondered, if i dont understand something there, if its wrong to ask in this channel
[12:50:27] <fweht> nono i mean stuff like http headers, etc.
[12:50:35] <codebam2> #networking maybe
[12:50:36] <Maxdamantus> imo it's fine to ask in this channel.
[12:50:41] <fweht> ok cool!
[12:50:51] <fweht> will checkout #networking too, thanks codebam2!
[12:50:58] <codebam2> no prob :)
[12:51:21] <Maxdamantus> I suspect #networking is probably more about lower-level things like TCP/IP.
[12:51:42] <fweht> ah ok, but still good to know, maybe ill get to this point one day :D
[12:51:44] <Maxdamantus> and particularly about routing etc.
[12:52:34] <fweht> currently im reading into remix.run and its fun because it challenges me to learn stuff about the http protocol that i never touched when doing next.js or react
[12:54:58] <codebam2> they talk about routers and that kind of thing, but they've helped me configure headers in openbsd before

[23:07:19] <DynV> Is how I'm doing https://jsfiddle.net/a8uw1o9j/ the quickest way to run generate() ? Should inputLength = document.getElementById("length").value and generatePass(inputLength) instead? Or perhaps something else

[23:17:29] <onosendi> flughafen: you are aware that the `fetch` function there is just simulating the browser's native `fetch`, correct?

[23:19:33] <onosendi> flughafen: that second link you sent... you're awaiting `fetch`, then you're not doing anything with the result. Then you're `return await brow.pages()`, which is pointless to `await`.

[23:48:32] <ljharb> onosendi: no, i run `npm version patch`
[23:48:46] <ljharb> onosendi: then i `git push origin --tags`, and once the tag's tests pass, i `git push origin && npm publish`
[23:48:56] <ljharb> onosendi: why would i ever explicitly run any pre or post anything
[23:52:07] <onosendi> ljharb: ahhhh, I didn't realize `npm version` triggered preversion, postversion, etc.
[23:55:56] <ljharb> onosendi: npm run ANYTHING triggers `preANYTHING` and `postANYTHING`
