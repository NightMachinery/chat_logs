[02:05:21] <kuudes> some hundreds of billions of money russian central bank had as foreign reserves in fed and ecb just ceased to exist for them, it seems
[02:05:56] <quanticle> Relatedly, I wonder if it's sunk in yet for Putin that he's Xi Jinping's bitch now
[02:06:16] <kuudes> indeed. russia has something like 100 bn$ worth of yuan in china, or less
[02:07:05] <Betawolf> Yeah, the next decade or so are going to see Russia-China hug like never before
[02:07:20] <kuudes> you spelled bendover wrong
[02:07:59] <kuudes> hmm, its what, 3 am in moscow now?
[02:08:01] <Betawolf> I wonder at what point Putin will decide to shut the pipelines in retaliation for swift.
[02:08:39] <kuudes> thats the wonderful thing, germany won't be liable for that but russia
[02:09:44] <quanticle> It's disappointing that everyone's focusing on SWIFT when the freezing of central bank assets is a way bigger deal
[02:09:56] <quanticle> (At least that's the current Twitter zeitgeist)
[02:10:41] <kuudes> swift makes it so that they have hard time paying anything also to china until they get other systems working

[02:15:15] <quanticle> kuudes: Right, so if China remains in SWIFT and Chinese domestic banks act as a bridge between SWIFT and the Chinese CIPS, it's an open question as to whether the US would actually sanction China over that.
[02:15:33] <quanticle> We've turned a somewhat blind eye to China funding North Korea, for example.

[02:16:24] <kuudes> and well, russia has little money. how willing is china on lending them more?

[02:17:07] <kuudes> especially after this stickup

[02:50:29] <quanticle> Well, there were some initial indications of Belarussian troops joining in with the Russians, but they were never confirmed.
[02:50:41] <two2thehead> yep
[02:50:41] <quanticle> And there haven't been any reports since the early hours of Belarussian troops
[02:51:14] <Betawolf> quanticle: yeah, if it wasn't such an expensive way to do things I'd say they're sending in their old equipment and greenest troops to soften things up, but that's just anachronistic at this point.
[02:51:50] <Ralith> I wonder how many T-90s they actually have
[02:52:08] <quanticle> It's stupid if that's what they're doing. Even if you don't care about the soldiers, losing equipment unnecessarily to antitank missiles can't be smart.
[02:52:24] <kuudes> and giving ukrainians time to get their stuff together.
[02:52:58] <kuudes> well, I think even though medvedev has declared that russia needs no diplomatic relations with anyone, lukashenka might feel it wise to still smell the winds
[02:53:23] <kuudes> I mean, there could be a cozy old age pension for him in dubai or something; one has to ponder his options
[02:53:44] <kuudes> now that russian pension plans are not that fashionable anymore
[02:54:09] <quanticle> So this is actually something that I want to push back on: https://twitter.com/Noahpinion/status/1497705041951559682 <-- Yes Ukraine is much bigger, in terms of land area, than Iraq, but if you look at the population to occupier ratio, the Russian force is comparable to the force that we used to invade Iraq.
[02:54:11] <Robomot> Noah Smith üêáüá∫üá¶ (@Noahpinion): "Ukraine is usually displayed next to Russia, which makes it look small. But in fact it's bigger than France, and much bigger than Iraq. Not easy to occupy something that size with just 190k guys. To say nothing of the extremely angry 44 million people who live there."
[02:54:31] <quanticle> And Russia, unlike the US, isn't operating with nearly as much of a language barrier
[02:54:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> "the extremely angry 44 million people who live there" ... but are all 44 million of them extremely angry...?
[02:55:29] <two2thehead> quanticle, they're spread a lot wider though
[02:55:32] <two2thehead> OPFOR I mean
[02:56:04] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: probably like 90% of them are. remember the survey numbers in america after 9/11 - like 95% of people thought GWB was doing a fantastic job and we needed to invade afghanistan to smash those shitty towelheads as hard as possible, and the only question was if we'd use merely MOABs or get serious with nukes
[02:56:21] <quanticle> Right, but that makes counterinsurgency a lot easier. Most of Ukraine is like North Dakota. Flat farmland. Not a lot of rough terrain like Afghanistan.
[02:57:38] <quanticle> But the main thing will be the cities. If the Ukrainians can hold the main cities and some of the crossings over the Dneiper, with Western support they can keep Ukraine contested forever if they want to
[02:58:14] <gwern> (plus, feuding and denigrating the country and then getting super pissed at invaders *is* a time-honored slavic tradition)

[06:50:19] *** Joins: MerchantOfVenice (~patrick@user/merchantofvenice)
[06:53:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: What happens? Nothing in particular, I imagine... if it had link-live, it still will, and if it didn't... the issue here is what exactly? arxiv gets the class but ar5iv does not (or vice versa)?
[06:54:17] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: the issue is I think it probably would work but there's no way for LinkLive.hs right now to affect the ar5iv rewrites, and LinkArchive.hs can't do it either because the attribute stores a raw URL, so the JS is gonna have to do it
[06:54:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why would LinkLive.hs need to affect the ar5iv rewrites? In what way?
[06:56:18] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: well, LinkLive is ideally where all the knowledge lives about what domains work with live popups
[06:56:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> The only relevant case here is if you have a link to an ar5iv URL. So, does such a URL get the link-live class?
[06:56:58] <gwern> I just realized that there was an edge case there in the dynamic rewrites and it'll require encoding a little bit of live knowledge elsewhere. oh well.
[06:57:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> I am not actually sure that's true
[06:58:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> The thing you need to encode is "will a link to this URL work as a live popup"
[06:59:01] <gwern> well, arxiv.org qua arxiv.org does not support live popups. I did test this, and your standard arxiv.org/abs or arxiv.org/pdf does not work. so all arxiv.org links in pages or annotations are correctly missing any link-live class. but then the popups use the data attribute with ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org in it, and live popups (probably) work with that. but there's no way to say so
[06:59:01] <Robomot> ar5iv ‚Äì Articles from arXiv.org as responsive HTML5 web documents (ar5iv offers a modern web view for arXiv's preprints. An open community resource, on a quest to a full collection of high-quality documents.)

[06:59:01] <Robomot> 404 not found | https://arxiv.org/pdf
[06:59:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> If the answer is "yes, it will just work straightforwardly" or "yes, it will work because the JS will use an alternate domain/whatever that will make it work", I don't see that your build code has to care about that - either case should be treated as a "yes"
[06:59:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Er, haven't you got it backwards?
[07:00:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> The JS doesn't rewrite arxiv.org links to function as ar5iv links, but the other way around
[07:00:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> And even that only applies for locally archived pages
[07:00:37] <gwern> uh... good question. hm.
[07:00:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> So it *definitely* won't apply to the live popup case
[07:01:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> As far as the live popup code is concerned, ar5iv links are ar5iv links and arxiv links are arxiv links

[07:01:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> And ne'er the twain etc.
[07:02:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now, if you're suggesting that we *should* show live popups of ar5iv when we encounter arxiv (much as we show LW links as GW live popups), well, that's obviously doable, but it's not a thing that we do right now
[07:02:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But it would be totally unrelated to the existing target identifier rewriting, which, again, concerns archived pages only)
[07:06:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: So the original question should be asked about the the live embed popup URL rewriting (in extracts-content.js), and it currently concerns LW/GW and WP/WP-mobile (and possibly arxiv/ar5iv if we add that). And I say the answer is "encode this server-side; keep a list of domains which, though they do not themselves work as live embed popups, nevertheless can be made to work by suitable client-side rewriting for this
[07:06:25] <Obormot\Arcturus>  specific purpose; mark links to these domains as `link-live` accordingly"
[07:08:07] <gwern> what would happen if I set arxiv links to link-live? seems like the rewrites to PDF links will act the same, because the annotation docMetadata overrides it, the /abs/ would break but it gets rewritten to ar5iv and the class would be inherited by the rewritten <a>, possibly?
[07:08:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> It does not get rewritten to ar5iv!
[07:08:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or do you mean that server-side this happens?
[07:09:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because the JS certainly does no such thing
[07:09:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> For annotated links the annotation popups would of course override the live ones, yes
[07:12:41] <gwern> hm. that might be the way to go, then
[07:13:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Meanwhile, some sort of styling glitch with the bare-URL links here https://www.gwern.net/Lorem#live-link-popups ... so when you added .uri to the CSS, you added it to the selector that styles code elements. But these here links have a <code> *inside* an a.uri ... so they get styled as code elements *twice*! And it looks weird and wrong, unsurprisingly

[07:13:54] <gwern> ah, is that what is going on? I was wondering but didn't have gumption to investigate after adding like 500+ domains & 20 icons & refactoring everything
[07:14:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: So... either put .uri on the links, style .uri as <code>, and *don't* wrap the link text in a <code> additionally; or *don't* style .uri, and *do* wrap the link text as <code> (as is done now)
[07:14:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Either works, both is bad
[07:15:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> ("don't style .uri" can also be "don't put .uri on the link tags", but if it's a Pandoc builtin that might be hard? anyhow, lots of ways to go here, just have a bit of an overload atm)
[07:16:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Is the .uri class used *only* for bare-URL links? And, is wrapping the link text in <code> inside the <a> something you did manually and can easily disable?
[07:17:16] <gwern> I think the <code> wrapping is my fault, yes. I argued that URLs are code, not natural language
[07:17:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Note that these choices aren't quite all equivalent - if we style the a.uri, then the linkicon goes inside the code element styling; if we don't style the <a> but wrap link text in <code>, then the linkicon goes outside the code element styling)
[07:17:49] <gwern> the default pandoc is to simply turn '<http://foo>' into [http://foo](http://foo){.uri} 
[07:18:13] <gwern> I in effect turn it into [`http://foo`](http://foo){.uri} 
[07:18:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, what do you prefer to do with the linkicon, I think is the thing that most obviously makes the choice here
[07:18:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Personally I think it should go outside the link styling, which means simply removing the .uri from the code styling selector will fix everything
[07:20:07] <gwern> yeah, the icon should go outside
[07:20:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Alright, I'll make the change

[09:13:52] <quanticle> And I think the answer is that every AI is going to have a human in charge of it, like how medical students operate under a supervising physician, and it's the supervisor who will be liable.
[09:14:19] <PapuaHardyNet> I sure hope so
[09:14:48] <quanticle> Unless the supervisor can demonstrate a clear defect in the design of the AI, in which case liability will fall back on the device manufacturer.
[09:14:51] <PapuaHardyNet> even then, the enormous impact a tiny error can have means just because a supervisor is "liable" doesn't mean they have the agency to prevent disasters caused by the AI
[09:15:15] <quanticle> Too bad. Don't put your car into self-driving mode.
[09:16:15] <quanticle> Every AI is going to come with an obnoxious warning screen that says that you operate this AI enabled system at your own risk and bear all responsibility for the actions that it takes
[09:16:42] <quanticle> Like in-car infotainment systems today have warning screens at startup that say that you bear all responsibility for becoming distracted by them
[09:17:16] <PapuaHardyNet> so the world is monotonically getting worse, okay
[09:17:37] <nshepperd2> don't worry, it could be worse, and will
[09:17:40] <quanticle> I mean, I'll take the warning screen if it allows me to have Android Auto
[09:17:53] <quanticle> Because the alternative is that I don't get Android Auto because of some dumbass government regulation
[09:18:51] <quanticle> Just like I'd rather have warning labels on cigarettes if the alternative is banning tobacco
[09:19:17] <PapuaHardyNet> the government should regulate actions that can have negative effective externalities
[09:19:22] <quanticle> No
[09:19:32] <quanticle> I mean, some actions, yes, but in general? No
[09:19:51] <quanticle> Just because an action can have a negative externality doesn't mean the government should automatically regulate it
[09:20:04] <quanticle> Because government regulations themselves have negative externalities
[09:20:23] <quanticle> Which can easily outweigh the negative externalities of the actions they are seeking to prevent
[09:20:45] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, how about expected value: if the expected value of the externality of an action is more negative than that of increasing government regulation, then the action should be regulated
[09:21:45] <nshepperd2> tautologically, the government should do whatever maximizes expected utility, but probably won't
[09:21:47] <quanticle> Okay, but you're going to have to do an honest cost-benefit calculation of the government's enforcement action, as carried out by the (relatively incompetent) government that you have, as opposed to some hyper-competent neo-Singapore
[09:22:09] <quanticle> That exists in theory but will never exist in practice
[09:22:46] <PapuaHardyNet> sure
[09:23:01] <quanticle> And if you do that, I bet you're going to find out that the cost/benefit calculation of a lot of *existing* government interventions (much less future proposed ones) goes negative
[09:23:24] <PapuaHardyNet> so in practice you are in favor of minimum regulation *because* you expect that the cost of increasing government regulation is significantly higher than predicted
[09:23:45] <quanticle> Yep. Government is a very blunt instrument and should be reserved for blunt problems.
[09:24:09] <quanticle> If it requires any nuance at all, we should be very wary of having government regulate it
[09:25:36] <nshepperd2> what should probably happen is when you buy a self driving car you also buy a contract that makes the manufacturer liable for accidents no matter whether it's a "clear defect"
[09:25:47] <quanticle> We can just look at the SESTA/FOSTA regulations for a recent example of this. They were well intentioned regulations which limited Section 230 protections for sites advertising escort services. The intent was to limit sex trafficking. But, two years on, every indication is that the regulations had the opposite of the intended effect, and sex trafficking has gotten worse as a result.
[09:27:00] <quanticle> Because government is a blunt instrument, and rather than taking a nuanced approach and trying to distinguish sites that served sex workers from sites that trafficked women, we just shut down everything and drove sex workers back onto the streets.
[09:27:02] <nshepperd2> the cost of this contract tells you how safe the manufacturer thinks the elf driving is
[09:27:11] <quanticle> >elf driving
[09:27:20] <nshepperd2> lmao
[09:27:22] <quanticle> I too believe that my adaptive cruise control is elf-powered
[09:27:38] <nshepperd2> elves have notorious quick reflexes
[09:27:45] <quanticle> Maybe Tesla should get better elves lmao
[09:28:05] <PapuaHardyNet> hey nshepperd2, I've been reading about how autodiff is implemented in jax to figure out this question but I'd like to hear your evaluation
[09:28:14] <nshepperd2> however their eyesight is bad and sometimes can't see stationary trucks
[09:30:47] <nshepperd2> were SESTA/FOSTA regulations actually well intentioned
[09:31:00] <PapuaHardyNet> I need to implement a custom backward/ gradient update for a self-attention mechanism. this means I can't simply use jax.grad() to get the gradient. however, since grad() uses VJP, I don't think you can simply separate the network into pieces and use grad() in one part, and custom_grad() in other parts
[09:31:09] <nshepperd2> i got the impression there were a bunch of anti-sex-worker lobbyists behind it
[09:32:32] <nshepperd2> which still makes the point though, bc any government regulation, in addition to being poorly thought out, will inevitably be corrupted by hostile interests
[09:32:49] <nshepperd2> or rent seeking, or etc
[09:33:57] <PapuaHardyNet> actually, that contract solution is really elegant
[09:34:04] <PapuaHardyNet> now that I think about it
[09:35:22] <nshepperd2> PapuaHardyNet: you can define custom derivatives for jax functions https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Custom_derivative_rules_for_Python_code.html
[09:35:23] <Robomot> Custom derivative rules for JAX-transformable Python functions ‚Äî JAX documentation
[09:35:30] <nshepperd2> and then that will be used in jax.grad
[09:36:10] <saturn2> i wonder if i could trick some random stranger into accepting all legal responsibility for everything i do
[09:36:40] <nshepperd2> try it and find out
[09:37:21] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd2: sweet, thank you. I'll see how far I can push jax
[09:41:32] <quanticle> nshepperd2: Will future AI regulations be any better intentioned than SESTA and FOSTA were?
[09:41:35] <nshepperd2> actually what you could do is the lemon market trick: make the manufacturer solely liable for anything that is clearly a product defect, and both manufacturer and user liable for anything else
[09:42:57] <nshepperd2> (*both* pay the full cost for medical treatments / fines / whatever, and the extra money is burned / returned to the central bank)
[09:44:08] <nshepperd2> thereby not incentivizing the manufacturer to disguise bad design as user error to get out of responsibility for it
[09:50:41] <PapuaHardyNet> you should pivot to policy making
[09:51:01] <PapuaHardyNet> "The Axiom project focuses on the ‚Äú30 Year Horizon‚Äù. The primary philosophy is that Axiom needs to develop several fundamental features in order to be useful to the next generation of computational mathematicians." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_(computer_algebra_system)#Philosophy

Knuth's literate programming technique is used throughout the source code. Axiom plans to use proof technology to prove the correctness of ‚Ä¶)
[09:52:10] <nshepperd2> this probably actually makes sense for self driving cards, bc buyers being informed is unlikely, and the failure cases are long tail and will tend to be neglected unless someone pays insurance against it
[09:52:24] <PapuaHardyNet> lol the Axiom repository quotes 0hpl https://github.com/daly/axiom
[09:52:25] <Robomot> GitHub - daly/axiom: Axiom is a free, open source computer algebra system
[09:53:43] <quanticle> nshepperd2: I like the approach, but the problem is that manufacturers are much better resourced, coordinated and incentivized than consumers.
[09:54:00] <nshepperd2> well yeah that's the point
[09:54:34] <PapuaHardyNet> basically you are removing externalities by merging incentives >.>
[09:55:47] <nshepperd2> but you would need government regulation to accomplish this probably, direct consumer markets like to strip away even the choice of such incentive improving arrangements
[09:55:49] <nshepperd2> they are 'costs' to be 'cut'
[09:56:01] <quanticle> No, what I'm saying is that the reason there's a lemon market in the first place is the same reason your approach will never get adopted. Why would any self-driving car manufacturer agree to share liability with an idiot consumer, regardless of whether the consumer can demonstrate a clear defect or not? They'll either restrict their AI features, or (more likely) they'll lobby the hell out of
[09:56:02] <quanticle> Congress to not pass this legislation.
[09:56:13] <nshepperd2> so how this would actually happen i have no idea, it's probably impossible
[09:56:43] <quanticle> Congress/Parliament/whatever
[09:57:04] <nshepperd2> right exactly, idiot consumers are short sighted and don't want to pay for quality
[09:57:10] <PapuaHardyNet> here we go, government regulation. I feel smug
[09:57:37] <nshepperd2> and uninformed
[09:57:42] <quanticle> PapuaHardyNet: If that's the conclusion you're drawing from this discussion, you're either too blinded ideologically or stupid to be worth talking to
[09:58:00] <nshepperd2> which is how you get springform pans which are 1.5 cents cheaper to manufacture but immediately fall apart
[09:58:41] <quanticle> The entire point I'm making is that good government regulation is basically impossible to implement, so either we'll get shitty government regulation or no regulation at all. And, frankly, I'd rather have no regulation than shitty regulation
[10:00:02] <nshepperd2> maybe an informed customer could negotiate a one-off such liability contract with the company but it would be super expensive and they would probably just ignore you because the volume of informed customers isn't enough to be worth it
[10:00:04] <quanticle> Because government regulation doesn't just spring up fully formed. It has to be crafted. And who's going to craft it? It'll be lobbyists of some sort. Either from the auto manufacturers or NGO groups who oppose them.
[10:00:05] <PapuaHardyNet> lol yeah I agree with you. what point I was making is that nshepperd pointed out that contracts are an elegant solution(!) but they won't work *because* there would need to be government regulation to enforce the fact that such contracts happen
[10:00:40] <nshepperd2> basically the only way to fix capitalism is to put nootropics in the water supply
[10:00:41] <PapuaHardyNet> which, sure, ties into *your* point that this means that such contracts won't happen because they require effective government regulation, and therefore aren't practical
[10:01:05] <quanticle> Oh, no, you don't need government regulation for the contracts; the problem with the contract approach is that it's not worth the manufacturer's time or effort to spin up an entirely new production line and retool equipment to serve, uh... let's see, just nshepperd and Obormot
[10:01:09] <quanticle> Possibly adiabatic
[10:01:35] <PapuaHardyNet> uhhh, what
[10:01:55] <PapuaHardyNet> okay
[10:02:32] <PapuaHardyNet> in summary, you are saying that because a minority of people will only want such contracts enforced, therefore manufacturers can and will externalize costs of their mistakes to the end user
[10:02:37] <quanticle> I was speaking with regards to springform pans and uninformed consumers. The population of people who 1) are informed about this and 2) care enough to look for an alternative isn't high enough for any pan manufacturer to go back to the old tooling.
[10:02:44] <quanticle> Yeah
[10:02:50] <quanticle> It's like touchscreens in cars
[10:03:10] <quanticle> Do I want them? No. But do I care enough to *alter which car I'm buying* in order to avoid them? Also no.
[10:03:14] <quanticle> So we get touchscreens in cars.
[10:03:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: I care! I totally care! But there aren't any non-touchscreen options!
[10:03:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> I want to vote with my wallet *but I can't*
[10:04:24] <quanticle> Mazda, allegedly, but Mazda is also the car manufacturer whose radios get stuck onto a single station if that station happens to send a mildly misformatted digital radio broadcast, because they can't do the simplest of validation around missing file extensions.
[10:04:43] <quanticle> So, y'know, them's the breaks
[10:04:56] <PapuaHardyNet> and nshepperd is saying that we can use a contract, where you can *pay* for a deal where the cost of any manufacturing defect impact (say, an accident by a self-driving car) will be borne by the manufacturer
[10:05:45] <quanticle> Right, but which manufacturer will agree to such a contract? No one. And you can argue that government should force manufacturers to accept such contracts, but who's going to write the legislation around that?
[10:05:57] <PapuaHardyNet> that's correct
[10:07:00] <PapuaHardyNet> that's exactly what I was saying - in the end, even elegant coordination solutions involve using some form of (1) hierarchical retribution (regulation, moderators), (2) social norms
[10:07:07] <nshepperd2> they might agree but for an astronomical price that makes it not worth it bc of no economy of scale
[10:07:47] <PapuaHardyNet> what you are saying is that because all government regulation is expected negative value, we should entirely avoid that class of solutions to coordination problems
[10:07:54] <quanticle> Well, not all
[10:08:01] <nshepperd2> like maybe if i had a billion dollars i could pay calphalon to spin up the old production line for a bit
[10:08:01] <quanticle> After all, property rights are "government regulation"
[10:08:15] <PapuaHardyNet> and what, leave people to fend for themselves? Because that is exactly what it means when you have a blind spot around an entire class of coordination problem solutions
[10:08:19] <quanticle> They only exist insofar as you have a government enforcing and adjudicating them
[10:09:45] <PapuaHardyNet> why do you hate government regulation so much? I do not hold any love for the government I live under, or any government, and on average regulation has only hurt me, but you have a rather... emotional aversion to the idea
[10:10:33] <quanticle> Because, like I said, it's a blunt instrument and it makes people unable to solve their own problems
[10:11:35] <PapuaHardyNet> so you want people to fend for themselves. You clearly have limits to this idea, but on average, mistakes are people's fault and they should suffer for not having avoided it
[10:11:59] <quanticle> Yes! Otherwise how do you learn?
[10:12:07] <PapuaHardyNet> that's a very ruthless and coldhearted way to view the world, from my perspective
[10:13:19] <PapuaHardyNet> mainly because you can and will use this perspective to ignore the suffering of others. Just world fallacy, basically.
[10:13:22] <nshepperd2> the government is also ruthless and coldhearted a lot of the time
[10:13:48] <saturn2> no one can do anything except follow their incentives, so there's no point in talking about this
[10:14:50] <quanticle> I don't think it's ruthless at all. I think it's far more ruthless to try to solve every coordination problem with a single centralized bureaucracy. We talk about "hardware overhangs" with regards to AI, yes? We have this idea that, because software lags behind hardware, by the time we have a good software algorithm for GAI, there will be more than enough hardware to run it. Well, there's a
[10:14:52] <quanticle> similar concept here: dictatorship overhang. We centralize so much power into a unitary government, that by the time a dictator comes around, he or she has far more power than they need to crush opposition.
[10:15:10] <PapuaHardyNet> I dislike governments and most government regulation, quanticle
[10:16:13] <saturn2> i would prefer if the government would tell me what to do all the time
[10:16:30] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, clearly you don't understand my point or don't want to see it. It is about hierarchical solutions. Anything works. saturn2 is a moderator here, and he ensures this place works well. That's one example.
[10:16:38] <quanticle> saturn2 will happily get into the pod and eat bugs if it would mean that I would STFU
[10:16:40] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm ending the discussion here.
[10:17:27] <quanticle> I guess my point is that hierarchical solutions only work insofar as you can trust the people at the top of the hierarchy absolutely, which, unfortunately doesn't scale.
[10:17:37] <quanticle> If the government was a FAI, I would have *zero* objections
[10:18:01] <PapuaHardyNet> your violent assertions completely blinded you to the fact that I had implicitly had trust as part of the point
[10:18:46] <saturn2> all the clever systems that people try to come up with as a replacement for virtue, they just don't work. there's no substitute!
[10:18:47] <quanticle> Yeah, but any solution that has trust baked in like that is basically ismorphic to "FAI takes over, the end"

[12:35:05] <PapuaHardyNet> at first glance it seems rather sensible - you can only afford to worry about "diversity" and whether everyone is being represented fairly *if* you are in an extremely high status position. The cost is trivial for you if things shift against your race - but that is not true for people in the lower class

[17:01:57] <kuudes> I mean surely a week should have higher than a day; but hard to discount properly
[17:02:15] <kuudes> it should never be over 0.1% in near future, and is over that now
[17:03:20] <two2thehead> kuudes, are you asking if EU wouldn't have done this if RU invaded Mongolia?
[17:04:22] <kuudes> imo eu would not have burned russia's moneys and basically banned all trade with russia for mongolia
[17:04:31] <kuudes> and I think this is not for ukraine either
[17:04:40] <kuudes> this is because putin has threatenet with nukes credibly
[17:04:50] <kuudes> so currently we are in the mode of "nukes are imminent"
[17:04:57] <two2thehead> ah
[17:05:13] <two2thehead> well I don't think that EU *doesn't* care about UA
[17:05:18] <kuudes> sure usre
[17:05:55] <kuudes> but the eu council seems to have changed everything
[17:06:14] <kuudes> ie orban is now inside the posse back again etc
[17:06:14] <two2thehead> I don't think we are in the 'nukes are imminent' mode either
[17:06:37] <two2thehead> I think everyone was sick of Putin in general, and this was the straw that broke the camel's back
[17:07:06] <kuudes> that would be convenient, but I think that is the naive state of mind
[17:07:19] <two2thehead> certainly possible
[17:07:48] <kuudes> ie what we are seeing seems to me to be that the nato military intelligence command is running a tour de force over the heads of governments and states
[17:08:38] <two2thehead> perhaps, but why didn't they do it earlier?

[17:08:51] <kuudes> something like that they have had a military doctor analyst brief them what specific mental illness putin has currently, and what specific triggers for nuke action he likely has etc
[17:09:12] <kuudes> two2thehead, putin threatened with nukes, was it in wednesday?
[17:09:51] <two2thehead> capisce, wait till you hear that the 'Ukrainian Nazi Regime' has a Jewish President
[17:10:03] <two2thehead> kuudes, hm
