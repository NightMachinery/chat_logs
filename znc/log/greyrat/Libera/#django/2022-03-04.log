[01:26:45] <orbyt> Hey all, just posted this question in #python but was referred here. Can someone give me some insight into what the @csrf_exempt decorator actually does?
[01:27:20] <orbyt> I get that it exempts the specific method from the middleware, but how does it do that and what else does it do?
[01:27:41] <orbyt> Basically, will adding that decorator to an endpoint cause problems for clients that are already sending a CSRF token to it?
[01:27:47] <orbyt> I'd assume not but wanted to check

[01:41:55] <FunkyBob> orbyt: IIRC it sets an attribute on the view which the middleware looks for
[01:42:36] *** Quits: Guddu (~Guddu@223.190.82.57) (Quit: Leaving)
[01:43:29] <orbyt> I believe the endpoint in question is a JSON RPC endpoint; I don't believe the is a "View" associated with it. That said, I'm not a python/django dev so perhaps the concept of a View is different
[01:43:38] <FunkyBob> orbyt: the decorator only stops the  middleware from enforcing checking the CSRF token on POSTS...
[01:43:51] <FunkyBob> if the view wants to enforce setting a token, it won't make any difference
[01:44:03] <FunkyBob> there is always a view
[01:44:14] <FunkyBob> the view is the callable that handles the request
[01:44:31] <FunkyBob> [don't get confused by MVC terminology.. it doesn't apply to server-side frameworks]
[01:45:28] <orbyt> ok, so regardless of how the request originates, the decorator simply disables the enforcing check, correct?
[01:45:36] <FunkyBob> yes
[01:45:56] <orbyt> I found https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/views/decorators/csrf.py but it didn't seem particularly insightful
[01:46:14] <orbyt> it notes `wrapped_view.csrf_exempt = True` which I guess is the meat of it
[01:46:23] <FunkyBob> yes
[01:46:31] <FunkyBob> you need to read that in combination with the middleware
[01:46:37] <orbyt> where's that?

[02:32:40] <jim> hi,,, I'm reading https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/tutorial04/ which is on forms and generic views,,, and I have some questions about each... first, is it possible to make a form just by creating a class?
[02:33:39] <jim> (I think I did that before, but by making a model class)

[02:47:08] <GinFuyou> Yeah, that's why I made that * correction. There are 'django forms' and 'html form tags'. Those are different entities and can work completely separate of each other
[02:47:30] <fikran> Anyone have a gitlab CI example that uses Django and postgres?
[02:47:35] <fikran> The example uses mysql.
[02:47:36] <GinFuyou> Actually, I always disliked that part of tutorial, you could check this instead separate
[02:47:43] <GinFuyou> https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_forms/
[02:48:37] <jim> ok, maybe I can make a form that is dropin replacement
[02:50:54] <GinFuyou> Typically you make a django form and could use {{ form }} in DTL to render body of the form (you still need <form> tag)
[02:51:16] <GinFuyou> Docs has a detailed section on more control about form rendering
[02:51:43] <GinFuyou> But technically you could write all html manually and just use django form at backend
[02:52:33] <jim> so <form>{{ theFormVar }}</form>?
[02:53:32] <GinFuyou> Yes, it's basic part. add a submit input\button and it's a minimal working example
[02:54:13] <jim> make the submit button in html?
[02:55:32] <GinFuyou> https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_forms/#template well check code snippet here

[12:06:25] <serafeim> but at my normal django work? *only* django compressor never anything fancier
[12:06:48] <serafeim> actually somtimes i even skip django compressor and use uncompressed JS because some stuff breaks when passed through it
[12:06:59] *** Joins: merrinx (~merrinx@ti0028a400-3686.bb.online.no)
[12:10:57] <serafeim> i've got two code blocks on my theme_base.html like this: https://dpaste.com/277UEF9WH
[12:11:52] <serafeim> when there's a js that works with django compressor i put it on extra_script. however when there's some funny js (or js that includes django thingies like {{ }}) i put it on extra_script_no_compress. and it always works
[12:12:05] <serafeim> this has saved me so much time that i can't even think about using *anything* else

[16:16:01] <theprophet> this is what i mean https://ibb.co/7JQHxJr
[16:17:07] <theprophet> is it possbile dtl or i have to do it in views(pythonic way)
[16:17:23] <nbjoerg> id=2?
[16:17:26] <GinFuyou> I'm not sure what this pseudocode supposed to mean?
[16:17:37] <nbjoerg> do you mean a.id == 2?
[16:17:42] <theprophet> yes
[16:17:53] <theprophet> i have two objects
[16:17:55] <theprophet> id =1
[16:17:57] <theprophet> id = 2
[16:18:05] <theprophet> and if id =1 is clicked in browser
[16:18:09] <theprophet> i want to its specific details
[16:18:23] <nbjoerg> so a.id == 1
[16:18:36] <theprophet> i know how to do it in views
[16:18:39] <GinFuyou> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/templates/builtins/#operator
[16:18:46] <theprophet> but i am asking if its possbile in dtl
[16:19:24] <theprophet> ahh i see
[16:20:08] <theprophet> GinFuyou thank you, .. nbjoerg thank you  for your attention.
[16:25:56] <theprophet> GinFuyou hm its not showing anything.
[16:26:48] <theprophet> https://ibb.co/QPn9Zm6 i did it right, right?
[16:28:06] <theprophet> GinFuyou https://ibb.co/2hf4gTx
[16:30:40] <theprophet> nbjoerg can you look at this please? what am i missing ?
[16:34:11] <GinFuyou> eh, we are back to what "id=1" is supposed to mean?
[16:34:44] <theprophet> no?
[16:34:48] <theprophet> what no
[16:35:06] <theprophet> 'title' does not work too
[16:35:14] <GinFuyou> wait, do you mean you want to like expand a block in browser dynamically when it's clicked?
[16:35:21] <theprophet> yes
[16:35:30] <GinFuyou> It's not possible in DTL
[16:35:36] <GinFuyou> DTL is server-side
[16:35:48] <theprophet> i see
[16:35:53] <theprophet> thats what i was asking
[16:35:57] <GinFuyou> it only renders HTML and HTML is sent to browser
[16:36:12] <theprophet> i see
[16:36:14] <GinFuyou> You need JS that will run on client to do that
[16:36:33] <theprophet> but it is possbile from the views?
[16:36:45] <theprophet> i am guessing , havent tried it yet
[16:37:12] <GinFuyou> No, if you want to do that in browser, it's only possible with javascript
[16:37:29] <theprophet> ok
[16:37:41] <GinFuyou> javascript can send request to django to load detailed info for example, but still need js
[16:38:10] <theprophet> what if i do this
[16:38:21] <theprophet> Article.objects.get(pk=1)
[16:38:29] <GinFuyou> Without JS you only can either reload the page or use some CSS tricks just to hide\unhide portions of html
[16:38:36] <theprophet> ok
[16:39:03] <theprophet> so i need to make a new html file for every object seperataly
[16:39:45] <GinFuyou> it doesn't to be file, or even html. You can sent serialized data (typically JSON) and do rendering with JS
[16:39:55] <GinFuyou> or just a small portion of html
[16:40:07] <theprophet> if i have a list of objects in one html file and as url to click those objects i want every object to display its own details , every field in model class
[16:40:12] <GinFuyou> But either approach is fine
[16:40:29] <theprophet> ok
[16:41:15] <GinFuyou> Could be 2 files = list.html and details_snippet.html if you are less comfortable with JS doing things
[16:41:27] <theprophet> i dont know js
[16:42:16] <GinFuyou> I wish I didn't either, but it's pretty much required if you have to do frontend part
[16:42:30] <theprophet> GinFuyou look https://ibb.co/VYvCH2v this is the list of objects in database by its title
[16:42:55] <theprophet> and when i click one of them
[16:43:09] <theprophet> i want it to be attached to the content of that specific title
[16:43:14] <theprophet> and you say i need java for that?
[16:43:43] <theprophet> i want it to be attached to the content of that specific title and display it in browser!
[16:43:53] <GinFuyou> javascript, not java. If you don't want to reload page - yes. And typically one doesn't for such job
[16:44:00] <theprophet> js yes sorry
[16:44:23] <theprophet> i see
[16:44:44] <theprophet> thats sad
[16:45:23] <GinFuyou> You could do it with page reload for sure, just have to sent another request with some parameter to django to know which object to expand
[16:45:35] <GinFuyou> but I never seen anyone actually doing it
[16:45:57] <theprophet> yea thats bad

[23:37:30] <jim> hi, on part 6 of the tutorial, and trying to get the style sheet to load, and it seems like {% static 'polls/style.css' %} is returning /polls/style.css, and the server log says https://termbin.com/rxlux and then I ctrl-C the server, and before it quits, says https://termbin.com/1pc6 and here is entire codebase: https://jam.sessionsnet.org/file-storage/view/libera-pastes/mysite-20220304-1203pt.tar

[23:54:05] <jim> GinFuyou, you're right, it doesn't look like that, something else is wrong... but that's all I got, the two server logs, first just after trying to get the index page, second just after ctrl-Cing the server
[23:54:33] <jim> should I give you the sqlite db as well?
[23:56:25] <jim> I just tried migrating, that worked, so I have another copy of the site (this one with a db but no data)
[23:57:25] <jim> I'm running it with that db, see if I get the same thing again
