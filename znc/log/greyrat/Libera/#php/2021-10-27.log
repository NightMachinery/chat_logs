[06:59:20] <lembron> as in,  $func(...$args); or such...
[07:00:29] <__adrian> just a note, "variable function" is not really a thing ($functionname() is no different than functionname()), and that's not the issue you're facing either
[07:01:00] <__adrian> it's how you're passing the arguments. the particular function you're calling takes an argument by reference
[07:01:29] <__adrian> that means you have to actually provide a $variable for that firsts arg, you can't unpack it or give a literal value
[07:03:06] <__adrian> actually... no. unpacking works
[07:06:55] <lembron> __adrian well there seems to be at least some extra magic, given that `array($obj, 'method')($arg)` works... - and dunno, that name i picked up from phpNet (whats not to be confused with annon-functions i guess...)

[07:17:26] <__adrian> it's consistent in every supported version  ;)
[07:17:34] <Blondie101010> you should take that as a huge hint that you should change that code
[07:17:43] <__adrian> i hope you're not worrying about versions of php that NO ONE should be using  :)
[07:18:56] <__adrian> btw the 7.0-7.2 error was the trailing comma, nothing to do with the function call  https://3v4l.org/JBVfm
[07:19:15] <__adrian> (also suggest not using trailing commas; trailing commas are dumb)
[07:23:30] <lembron> versioncontroll kinda disagrees...
[07:25:02] <__adrian> we're into a topic that doesn't _really_ matter, so there's no point in arguing it, but no it doesn't. it's a change, and a legit change.

[07:29:09] <__adrian> if your cs puts up with it  :)
[07:30:43] <lembron> well it had to - or the 150MB report would blow up codeclimate ;D

[14:55:56] <biberu> you're maintaining your own fork of 5.6?
[15:10:26] <CyberCr33p> biberu FreeBSD uses a system called "ports" to upgrade to newer versions of software. The PHP 5.6 port was removed in 01 Jan 2019. So to continue to support websites that depend on PHP 5.6 I create a FreeBSD jail (it's similar to linux LXC) and I run PHP 5.6 inside this jail. Because this specific bug is serious I would like to backport the patch to PHP 5.6. Do do this I fetch the "ports" tree from 01 Jan 2019 before the PHP 5.6 removal, I add the
[15:10:26] <CyberCr33p>  patch to the PHP 5.6 port and rebuild the "port". I have done this for PHP 7.1 and 7.2 and I wait tomorrow for the release of 7.3.22 (to use the official method).

[18:07:12] <DevAntoine> Not the value of the constant.
[18:07:17] <__adrian> if you're asking whether emulated prepares are enabled by default, the answer is yes

[18:07:28] <__adrian> but that was answered above and you didn't seem to like it

[18:09:21] <__adrian> it's not rdbms-dependent

[18:12:39] <DevAntoine> __adrian: oh, you mean that not passing this attribute would not emulate the statements by PDO and just passing it would make PDO emulate it?
[18:12:47] <DevAntoine> Oh gosh I just got it :D
[18:12:51] *** Joins: Pixi (~Pixi@user/pixi)
[18:13:19] <__adrian> no, pdo will, be default, emulate prepares. if you set the attribute explicitly, it will do what you say (true=emulate, false=native)
[18:13:36] <__adrian> very strongly recommend setting  false  and using native prepares
[18:13:50] <DevAntoine> but how do you know that by default it will emulate the statements?
[18:14:10] <DevAntoine> Because regarding the query plan of postgres without this attribute we do see prepared statement being executed by postgres
[18:14:22] <kuhilas> I have a form sending data to mysql and after php updated from 7.2 to 7.4 it goes to the die() function. Is there some better I could put there so I get some info what goes wrong?
[18:14:46] <__adrian> it's in the manual somewhere, but i don't know where offhand so i'll say "widely known"
[18:14:49] <__adrian> and it's always been so
[18:15:19] <DevAntoine> __adrian: well, I'd like to know where in the manual, that's my question.
[18:15:27] <__adrian> you checked getAttribute() and it said  true  but pg still saw native prepares?
[18:15:53] <DevAntoine> __adrian: no I didn't checked getAttribute()
[18:16:06] <__adrian> that's the first step
[18:16:08] <DevAntoine> Maybe Doctrine disabled it by default
[18:16:18] <DevAntoine> __adrian: well you said it's enabled by default :D
[18:16:23] <__adrian> i did
[18:16:35] <__adrian> but that doesn't mean it's not being set somewhere you don't realize/expect
[18:20:55] <__adrian> hm. swear i've seen it before, but i can't find it now. and there are docs bugs that imply the default _can_ be different per driver ._·
[18:21:46] <__adrian> https://php.net/pdo-pgsql doesn't mention, but https://php.net/pdo-mysql
[18:21:48] <__adrian> does

[18:24:55] <biberu> __adrian: i don't really know how this works, but i skimmed the code before and it looked like getAttribute got the value from the driver, let me see if i can find the place again

[18:30:03] <__adrian> doctrine may set it, i couldn't answer that (but again, false is GOOD). as we discovered it might also vary by driver.
[18:33:14] <relipse> do I have to use bind_result?

[18:45:37] <__adrian> tip: if you see   `or ...` in a tutorial, it's probably a bad tutorial.
[18:45:50] <__adrian> not always, but almost.
[18:45:51] <kuhilas> I guess that was not for me
[18:46:02] <__adrian> ?
[18:46:41] <__adrian> it was for you.   mysqli_report(MYSQLI_REPORT_STRICT); $haku = mysqli_query($yhteys, $sql);
[18:47:45] <kuhilas> I find this regarding Error 1024 but nothing else there, how can I get it more verbose? : 1024    E_USER_NOTICE (integer)     User-generated notice message. This is like an E_NOTICE, except it is generated in PHP code by using the PHP function trigger_error().
[18:51:55] <Naktibalda> kuhilas: mysql error 1024 means that you have syntax error
[18:52:27] <Naktibalda> I mean 1064, did you really get 1024 ?
[18:52:34] <kuhilas> any guide I could follow to replace die()?
[18:53:04] <Naktibalda> kuhilas: make it throw exceptions
[18:53:46] <Blondie101010> hmmm not sure that would be better
[18:54:13] <Blondie101010> mysql_connect(...) or throw new Exception("Why the heck am I calling this?")
[18:55:45] <kuhilas> I added a line with `mysqli_report(MYSQLI_REPORT_STRICT);` before executing this mysqli_query() leaving that trigger_error() but still same just showing Error: 1024
[18:56:36] <Blondie101010> error 1024 is a SQL syntax error
[18:57:05] <Blondie101010> output the SQL and play with it in the DB directly
[18:57:27] <Naktibalda> Blondie101010: it really came from  or trigger_error()
[18:57:40] <kuhilas> then when I run the code, it goes through and redirects me as if everything went fine but the data was not saved to database
[18:58:09] <kuhilas> without or die() and with mysqli_report
[18:58:12] <Naktibalda> show your code
[18:58:17] <Blondie101010> are you checking your return values?
[18:58:47] <kuhilas> that $sql has a `INSERT INTO` statement
[18:58:49] <BadAdviceCat>  Using the `Or` logical operator in other words is a good indicator of bad code.
[18:59:12] <Blondie101010> not good practice

[19:02:57] <__adrian> MYSQLI_REPORT_STRICT makes mysqli throw. do not use trigger_error().
[19:03:17] <Naktibalda> use PDO instead :)
[19:03:21] <__adrian> it's set on the driver. you only need to call it once.

[19:04:00] <__adrian> !+error reporting
[19:04:00] <php-bot> Set `error_reporting = -1` in your php.ini (to see errors on your webpage, also set `display_errors = 1`) and be sure to restart your webserver/fastcgi-listeners. Using `ini_set()` and `error_reporting()` is less reliable - for example, in the case of parse errors. See https://php.net/errorfunc.configuration or "/msg php-bot error logging" for more.
[19:04:09] <Blondie101010> ini_set() is fine for troubleshooting
[19:04:27] <kuhilas> this code has worked many years, but last night the server updated php 7.2 to 7.4
[19:04:51] <__adrian> upgrading php would not have cause an sql error
[19:04:52] <Blondie101010> that is suprising but it makes sense
[19:05:01] <kuhilas> too much code
[19:05:03] <__adrian> if your db was _also_ upgraded...
[19:05:04] <BadAdviceCat> ^ that too, use PDO instead of mysqli. Why? Because read here: https://phpdelusions.net/pdo/mysqli_comparison
[19:05:05] <Blondie101010> we haven't seen how the query is built

[19:13:15] <Blondie101010> kuhilas:  var_dump($haku) after it gets assigned and tell us the result please
[19:13:22] <__adrian> yes - we also need to see the output (the error message you get) and show us ^
[19:13:54] <kuhilas> the page reloads the page and the data is not put into the database. originally there was `or die("error"); and that got triggered since php 7.4 update
[19:14:24] <kuhilas> and so the page showed the text "error" but now it doesn't show anything after removing `or die()`
[19:14:35] <kuhilas> just reloads page and no new data in db
[19:15:08] <kuhilas> reloading the page is normal behaviour, but normally after reload it lists the new data on that page.
[19:15:19] <__adrian> what do you see instead
[19:15:41] <kuhilas> I see the old data but not the new data added, so it looks exactly same as before posting the form data
[19:16:24] <__adrian> add blondie's suggestion. after  $haku = mysqli_query( ... );  do  var_dump($haku); exit;
[19:16:24] <Naktibalda> remove that meta tag to see the output
[19:16:46] <__adrian> and yeah, don't refresh/reload
[19:16:52] <__adrian> you want to see the output
[19:17:13] <__adrian> btw highly recommend !+error logging
[19:17:13] <php-bot> btw highly recommend, In addition to configuring error reporting (/msg php-bot error reporting), set log_errors=1 and error_log=/path/to/your/error.log in your php.ini file. This allows you to simply tail the log to see errors, and to disable display_errors (e.g., during production).
[19:17:40] <__adrian> when you only display errors on your webpage, they're gone once you leave that page and you can't know what went wrong
[19:18:09] <kuhilas> commented out the meta refresh line and added the var_dump and exit after that $haku and now I get a page saying only: bool(false)  and no old or new data below
[19:18:09] <Naktibalda> print $sql too
[19:18:32] <Blondie101010> yeah the $sql should make it quite obvious

[19:26:34] <Blondie101010> hold on

[19:27:31] <kuhilas> what should I add as a default value for that field on the database? The field will put a date timestamp for a later date when someone later will mark this item "done"

[19:27:42] <Blondie101010> no
