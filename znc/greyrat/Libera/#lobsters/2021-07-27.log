[02:09:09] <bkero> Not if they've implemented backoff and acks

[02:10:04] <kline> but still, this isnt a suitable drop-in replacement for TCP, since you need to rework anything that touches TCP to use messages rather than streams

[12:12:29] <mbarbar> There's a site I saw on HN and maybe lobsters where some guy was making "simple" things using basic materials like clay, wood, cotton, glass. It was really simple HTML/CSS and the project I remember was created cords from copper wire and cotton, and maybe a radio (there were a lot). I've lost the site though, anyone know what I'm referring to?

[22:38:23] <maskd> one of the big holy wars at work is merging master into a feature branch (for which there's an open pull request) vs. rebasing and force-pushing
[22:38:53] <manicennui> Coworker just noticed that our test suite hasn't actually been doing anything for over 2 weeks.
[22:38:54] <maskd> despite having had multiple discussions about it I still don't understand why you'd prefer merging, but people say that rebasing makes code review confusing
[22:38:55] <manicennui> LOL?
[22:38:59] <maskd> I blame github's UI
[22:39:07] <rhn_mk1> both options suck when using sth like github
[22:39:11] <manicennui> maskd: Fortunate we just don't care.
[22:39:18] <manicennui> And we always do squash and merge.
[22:39:28] <ngoldbaum> doesn’t github have a rebase button now?
[22:39:51] <maskd> no, I mean if you open a pull request, then things get pushed to master so you need to update your branch
[22:40:10] <ngoldbaum> oh i see what you’re saying
[22:40:18] <ngoldbaum> yes clearly rebasing is better in that case
[22:40:32] <rhn_mk1> [citation needed]
[22:40:36] <ngoldbaum> def love to review a PR with 5 real commits and 25 merging commits
[22:40:42] <maskd> you'd think so, but some people disagree, for reasons that are still unclear to me
[22:41:14] <rhn_mk1> the reason is, unless you tested each commits after the rebase, you haven't tested them
[22:41:26] <rhn_mk1> in my experience, commits are tested before rebasing, not after
[22:41:26] <ngoldbaum> sure but that’s what CI is for
[22:41:40] *** Quits: thelazyoxymoron (~thelazyox@49.207.212.202) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[22:41:50] <rhn_mk1> CI doesn't test the same way as a human does
[22:42:06] <ngoldbaum> so you do special tests that aren’t automated?
[22:42:12] <ngoldbaum> no wonder people skip them a lot
[22:42:14] <rhn_mk1> but I'm willing to accept that if you have a strong CI
[22:42:36] <rhn_mk1> if you do UI work on a small team, then yeah, that's not getting tested
[22:42:53] <rhn_mk1> even worse if it needs hardware access

[22:46:06] <gwozniak> ^ Smells like industry/business news
[22:46:48] <maskd> one of the reasons that's been given to me is that if you rebase after a review they have to review everything again (including the commits from before the rebase), since you're rewriting history. but I don't see how a merge would be any easier in that case because you need to keep track of two different histories in order to understand the merge commit

[22:47:48] <maskd> my thinking is that I always need to review the whole thing again, especially given github's weird UI
[22:48:03] <ngoldbaum> maskd: sure the working directory should be the same in either case, i’m not sure any nontrivial merges with conflicts that happened actually get reviewed at all
[22:48:20] <ngoldbaum> there’s no way to tell whether a merge commit had conflicts or not just looking at git logs
[22:49:06] <ngoldbaum> also if you want to review commit by commit using github seems like a poor choice
[22:49:20] <ngoldbaum> the UI makes that workflow very against the grain
[22:49:41] <amvc> maskd: Rebase + squash is the only way for medium-sized teams and above, IMHO
[22:49:46] <maskd> right, it's really optimized for reviewing the whole thing at once
[22:50:04] * ngoldbaum remembers the time someone committed a 1 GB data file the. removed it two commits later, increasing the repo size by 2 GB and no one noticed because there wasn’t a net change
[22:50:25] <ngoldbaum> no one noticed for a month and we had to rewrite public history to fix it
[22:50:49] <maskd> :S
[22:51:43] <mgdm> I worked with some devs who would always just do `git add .` and commit whatever was there, and some others weren't that careful at the review phase, which is how our web app ended up with things like zero-byte `a.out` files in the public webroot

[22:57:07] <maskd> we always squash and rebase pull requests, but I got a weird request the other day. I had a PR where I converted a bunch of files from JavaScript to TypeScript, which involved renaming them and also making a lot of changes to make them work. because there were a lot of changes the diff looked like a deleted file + added file instead of a rename, so the reviewer asked me to split the change into a
[22:57:09] <maskd> commit that just renamed the files, and then another that made the changes

[22:57:31] <maskd> I explained to the reviewer that he could tweak git diff to make it show the changes as renames, but he really wanted to have two separate commits, even though they'd only live in the PR since I'd be squashing when merging
