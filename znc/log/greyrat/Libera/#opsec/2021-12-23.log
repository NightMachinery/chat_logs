[04:48:34] <Joanna> lwhat do you all think might be the best approach to solve the problem of vulnerabilities in software. There are always going to be flaws in software.
[05:00:20] <Roey> well we already tried auto-fix
[05:00:26] <Roey> like apply aupdaetes auotmatically
[05:00:28] <Roey> force updates on users
[05:00:56] <Roey> another approach is to use a more memory safe language or library and phase out the old vulnerable ways of doing things.
[05:04:50] <Joanna> I definitely don’t like the idea of forcing updates written by people who couldn’t write code properly before upon users.
[05:05:36] <Joanna> I wonder what the most memory safe language is.

[18:02:25] <Joanna> So what was the purpose of creating safe languages in the first place. It would have been easier to go with the best languages for buffer overflows and backdoors...
[18:03:10] <Joanna> Or maybe they changed their minds once computers got popular
[18:16:21] <jan6> 1) it was early days anyway and 2) almost all the bugs come from programming style, and language use, not from the language itself being bad
[18:20:22] <jan6> as far as I can see, the options are basically to 1) have the compiler attempt to foresee every possible interaction, and scream if there's a problem (which would require a strict language like ada for it to even be able to do it reliably and well) (done by ada and to some extent rust and zig) 2) have it detect problems at runtime and attempt to handle them, such as intentionally crashing/restarting
[18:20:23] <jan6> (most languages) 3) have the language in a way that you CAN'T do most unsafe things in the first place (ada and zig and rust)
[18:21:02] <jan6> but the tradeoff is generally intentional, anyway
[18:24:09] <jan6> like C explicitly is meant for the programmer who KNOWS what they're doing, and allows them to do ANYTHING, with extremely minimal overhead, while all the "safe" languages assume stuff you want, and won't let you do cool tricky stuff that uses your knowledge of the innate workings, because they assume you don't want to do anything special, and they quite often have extra overhead, both because they
[18:24:10] <jan6> tend to be a bit higher level, and because they usually have runtime checks ANYWAY, even if the compiler ALSO checks for safety
[18:25:49] <jan6> it's not that hard to write safe C code, if you know what you're doing, why you're doing it that way, and how it could possibly go wrong, but most people don't think all the code through, they just write it to do "the thing" they want at that moment
[18:27:05] <fnk> >they just write it to do "the thing" they want at that moment
[18:27:08] <fnk> and that's how php was born
[18:27:12] <jan6> lol
[18:27:34] <jan6> php seriously looks to be "should we do A or B? f it, let's do BOTH"
[18:27:39] <jan6> for every single decision
[18:27:40] <jan6> lol
[18:27:58] <fnk> and there's probably an option C you haven't even though about
[18:28:17] <jan6> there always is
[18:29:26] <jan6> there's always an option to do things differently, such as lisp vs smalltalk vs c-style languages
[18:32:35] <jan6> for example one could argue that image-based programming, like with smalltalk, is the best way to have reproducable code, because you have all the resources in a known image, that behaves the same on all the systems, and you can always go into the image to debug it, live
[18:33:08] <jan6> but then someone else will insist that "just make a static executable, it's much smaller and basically same effect"
[18:38:50] <Joanna> If something is written in a safe language it should be harder for there to be vulnerabilities I would think.
[18:41:14] <Joanna> People make mistakes so even if it’s possible to write good code in c doesn’t mean c language should be used unless plausible deniability for bad code is the goal.
[18:45:58] <jan6> safeness and vulnerable-ness are totally unrelated metrics
[18:46:08] <jan6> you can write bad and vulnerable code in ANY language
[18:46:33] <jan6> like if you write a password login system in rust, that won't prevent you from storing them as plaintext
[18:47:57] <jan6> C should be used for all low-level code, imho, but not for high level stuff, like non-cli programs (cli programs are a middle ground where it MAY be used, because portability is very good thing to have)
[18:51:29] <Joanna> I just looked at ada tutorial from #ada  channel and it looks a lot like pascal but the end keyword says what it is ending.
[18:53:47] <Joanna> I think the bad code possible with c is probably much worse than the bad code possible with ada
[18:57:56] <Joanna> But as I said before there are vested interests in there being backdoors in code hence the popularity of languages that allow that feature.
[19:12:07] <fnk> It depends on your definition of bad code

[20:05:37] <Joanna> Bad is definitely a matter of opinion. I define bad from the perspective of the end user. I don’t want code doing things I don’t want it to on my computer.
[20:08:26] <Joanna> There is a school of thought that the significant up front costs for development of computers had an ulterior motive.
[20:10:08] <Joanna> In my opinion there are too many things controlled by computers and too much dependency upon the power grid.
[20:11:19] <jan6> I define bad from the perspective of the end user. I don’t want code doing things I don’t want it to on my computer.
[20:11:26] <jan6> in that case, "safe" languages don't matter at all
[20:11:38] <jan6> since you just want isolation and containerization ;P
[20:12:58] <jan6> akin to how android apps run under different linux users, with strict SElinux policy allowing access to only specific areas, and requiring the declaration (often requiring user confirmation), of any "capability" they require
[20:15:48] <jan6> there's also the linux kernel's isolation features that for example lxc/lxd and docker take advantage of, where you can have namespaces for pretty much everything, so different programs can have totally different views of the computer, or same views with some things overriden (such as /etc/hosts is actually stored at /etc/myapp/hosts, allowing the main computer's hosts file to be separate from the
[20:15:48] <jan6> app's, but still have the app's environment act as if it's hosts file was the real one)
[20:16:28] <jan6> and both linux and BSDs generally have some sort of "capability/pledge" or such mechanism, to not require apps to run as root, too
[20:17:14] <jan6> like you don't need the entire "ping" program to run as root, you just give it the CAP_NET or whatever, and run it as normal user
[20:18:44] <jan6> also, the only way to force people to have non-electric-grid fallbacks for stuff, is to cause a massive enough failing to clearly illustrate the need
[20:18:57] <jan6> because capitalism and conservationalism
[20:19:33] <jan6> why would you make a non-grid-powered fallback, if the grid never has any power failtures around your area? why bother with extra cost? etc
[20:20:51] <Joanna> People have been brought up feel like it’s some sort of entitlement to be wasteful .
[20:22:45] <jan6> well, some of them probably like feeling powerful enough that they can afford to waste stuff, like "look at me, I can afford a new iphone every year, HAH, you're such a peasant"
[20:23:07] <jan6> some others probably just don't want to bother with the extra effort to NOT waste stuff
[20:23:26] <Joanna> I’m not really talking about fallbacks, I’m against building wasteful stuff to begin with . Some of my happiest moments in computing is when I discover a simpler more efficient way to do something and get rid of a lot of bloated code.
[20:23:36] <jan6> for some reason, even bothering to sort their garbage seems too hard for some people
[20:24:06] <jan6> also yes, there's a famous quote about "my most productive day was when I removed 100 lines of code" or such
[20:24:32] <Joanna> It should not take extra effort not to be wasteful. Blaming the end user isn’t right.
[20:24:53] <jan6> *1000 lines, apparently, and attributed to ken thompson
[20:25:27] <jan6> well, modern computers are powerful enough that the devs just don't care, and prioritize comfortable, and fast development, over efficiency
[20:26:02] <jan6> like bundling an entire web browser and calling it a "native program", because it means they can just copy-paste their web app, and hit two birds with one stone
[20:26:05] <Joanna> The concept you are describing is called conspicuous consumption. Oh look at me I have air conditioning on all the time ...
[20:26:15] <Joanna> I’m successful!!
[20:28:16] <Joanna> There is another thing called potlatch that Indiana in the Pacific Northwest used to compete in gift giving and sometimes chiefs would destroy each other’s gifts to prove how they didn’t need them
[20:29:30] <Joanna> One thing is for sure luxury makes for weak and obese people.
[20:30:50] <jan6> not necessarily
[20:31:03] <jan6> what luxury does, is remove challenge
[20:31:18] <Joanna> There is a country I know of that went from practical easy to clean squat  toilets to electricity dependent robot toilets that can squirt water up your ass!!
[20:31:22] <jan6> some people set their own challenges, where luxury is a benefit, because they have all sorts of resources
[20:32:06] <jan6> but most people don't bother to do more than they need to, and as such, if they don't NEED to exercise, they won't bother to, if they don't NEED to eat healthily, they'll eat what they like, which is probably sugary
[20:32:06] <Joanna> Can you be more specific ?
[20:32:07] <jan6> etc
[20:33:57] <Joanna> I’ll tell you this. Senior citizens who have spent their lives without furniture are a heck of a lot stronger and more flexible that those who have spent their lives sitting in chairs.
[20:34:14] <jan6> of course
[20:34:44] <jan6> because as I said, most people don't seek out their own challenges, they just try to get through the natural ones, and that's it
[20:34:59] <jan6> also technically there's research about how chairs are bad, but whatever
[20:35:48] <Joanna> It’s not right setting people up to have to go out of their way to be healthy. Healthy life style should be built in.
[20:37:22] <Joanna> The closest thing to a chair in My home is the toilet and I would replace it with squat toilet if I could.
[20:38:45] <Joanna> The built environment that forces people to drive everywhere has had a horrible toll on health.
[20:40:40] <jan6> 19:07 <Joanna> The closest thing to a chair in My home is the toilet and I would replace it with squat toilet if I could.
[20:40:43] <jan6> you can real easily
[20:40:52] <jan6> just set up a big enough box around it ;P
[20:41:03] <jan6> then squat on the box
[20:41:48] <jan6> 19:08 <Joanna> The built environment that forces people to drive everywhere has had a horrible toll on health.
[20:41:54] <jan6> that's a thing mainly in the US
[20:42:15] <jan6> i most other places, pedestrian roads, and public transport are quite used things
[20:42:28] <jan6> and in some places, cycle roads too
[20:42:53] <jan6> a few places in the world are actually heavily dominated by bikes, not motor vehicles
[20:43:29] <jan6> and over here at least, you can walk literally anywhere within a city, there's no place I'm aware of where you can drive to, but not walk to
[20:43:41] <jan6> 19:05 <Joanna> It’s not right setting people up to have to go out of their way to be healthy. Healthy life style should be built in.
[20:43:57] <jan6> that is impossible, unless you go back to "every family for themselves" days
[20:44:28] <jan6> also nobody has to go out of their way to be healthy
[20:44:40] <jan6> you just have to make your way so it is that, in the first place
[20:46:03] <jan6> like, why would you care that other people go out for smoothies, popcorn, and restaurant food, weekly or monthly, and eat pizza every few days? you can simply choose to make all your food yourself, make your own pizza if you want it, etc
[20:46:30] <jan6> way healthier, and also gives you a workout from making the dough 'n stuff

[21:55:30] <jan6> 20:13 <Joanna> I hate western toilets they are so wasteful.
[21:55:32] <jan6> uh how
[21:55:50] <jan6> 20:13 <Joanna> I don’t want to sit on same seat as strangers
[21:55:54] <jan6> then don't ;P
[21:56:14] <jan6> options are to 1) hover, or 2) waste a bit of toilet paper for insulation
[21:56:32] <jan6> or 3) be a maniac and climb on top and squat
[21:56:55] <jan6> which should never be done in proper toilets, only on the crappy outdoors ones, if even there
[22:02:51] <Joanna> I don’t like wasting paper and sometimes there is no paper, also western toilets have to be cleaned constantly with brush to not be disgusting. Because of bad design.
[22:05:08] <Joanna> Squat toilets the water scrubs the bottom of trough clean
