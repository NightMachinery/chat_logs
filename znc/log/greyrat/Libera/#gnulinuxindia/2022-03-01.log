[09:57:57] <AryaK[m]> <Klisper[m]> "i meant the theme i mean i..." <- modeline?
[09:58:12] <AryaK[m]> are you talking about the modeline?
[10:03:34] <NeoVoid[m]> have you guyz ever heard the name of amrita university?
[10:04:27] <NeoVoid[m]> https://amrita.edu/ahead/mca/
[10:04:53] <AryaK[m]> amrita is an online lab made by govt iirc
[10:05:03] <NeoVoid[m]> wut?
[10:05:08] <AryaK[m]> https://www.amrita.olabs.edu.in/
[10:05:56] <Tor[m]> <gtlsgamr> "what is chal raha hai" <- Fogg XD 
[10:06:10] <Tor[m]> <labrador> "gtlsgamr, nothing right now..." <- I use vanilla 
[10:06:53] <NeoVoid[m]> AryaK[m]: hmm thats looks like different than what i shared
[10:09:11] <labrador> Tor[m], yeah vanilla is cool for android but I was looking for linux. Vinyl is nice too.
[10:09:14] <labrador> Also gm
[10:09:36] <relejek[m]> gtlsgamr Arya K  smud Neo Void Tor 
[10:09:36] <relejek[m]> i have something for you and everyone here. hope this brings some value to you today. look forward to getting your constructive feedback. DM me or tag @relejek or see my contacts at relejek.ml
[10:09:36] <relejek[m]> https://relejek.ml/public/blog/app-review-delta-chat/
[10:09:59] <Tor[m]> AryaK[m]: This doesn't open in ddg 
[10:10:25] <AryaK[m]> yeah it wont its expired cert i think
[10:10:33] <AryaK[m]> classic government website lol
[10:11:03] <AryaK[m]> also instead of redirectig everyone to public/
[10:11:08] <AryaK[m]> you can use git submodules
[10:11:16] <AryaK[m]> with codeberg 
[10:11:28] <AryaK[m]> so pages repo is a git submodulle inside relejekwebpage repo
[10:11:39] <labrador>  not valid for www.amrita.olabs.edu.in. The certificate is only valid for the following names: amrita.olabs.edu.in, cdac.olabs.edu.in, olabs.edu.in, www.olabs.edu.in
[10:11:49] <labrador> Why couldn't they use wildcards...
[10:13:31] <relejek[m]> Arya K:  Yeah i kept front page index.html for 'make your own front page'. and made a blog subfolder using hugo for systematic and standardized delivery of posts.
[10:13:49] <labrador> relejek[m], deltachat has a problem. It uses opportunistic encryption using autocrypt instead of mandatory encryption
[10:14:06] <labrador> That might make it a worse option compared to say...xmpp+omemo
[10:14:54] <labrador> So an active attacker could deliberately thwart the opportunistic handshake and snoop in
[10:14:58] <relejek[m]> labrador:  i don't see it as a problem but a solution to keep it accessible with other non-encrypted email providers.
[10:15:19] <labrador> relejek[m], I think its a chat app so it should be compared to other chat apps
[10:15:21] <labrador> Not email
[10:16:46] <relejek[m]> labrador: yes xmpp and matrix are way better yet they aren't well known and not easy to switch to. your coworkers who use email may switch to delta.chat but they worn't come on matrix or xmpp. i have tried.
[10:17:02] <labrador> 3>5. PRIVACY Also this might be dubious considering email leaks the most amount of metadata even when encrypted relejek[m].(this is constructive discussion right?I don't wanna be dissing you accidentally :p)
[10:17:49] <labrador> relejek[m], hmm could actually be true. It does lessen the network lock-in
[10:17:53] <relejek[m]> nah fam i have no love for delta.chat. i just like the unique concept
[10:19:16] <relejek[m]> labrador: this. the freedom to move around. kindda like matrix
[10:19:25] <labrador> 3>No in app audio or video calling feature. Hmm don't most chat applications use a dedicated audio/video protocol? I think even xmpp and matrix
[10:19:49] <labrador> relejek[m], well email is also federated like matrix so yeah true
[10:20:01] <relejek[m]> labrador:  yes i am not saying it is among the best one for privacy. it is just better than your gmail app. ig
[10:20:04] <Tor[m]> <labrador> "Also gm" <- More like good afternoon
[10:20:36] <labrador> yeah relejek[m] I agree too!
[10:20:41] <labrador> Better than gmail
[10:20:48] <relejek[m]> Tor:  you don't know where labrador at. it could be morning in their time-zone.
[10:20:55] <Tor[m]> labrador: Everything is better than email
[10:21:13] <Tor[m]> relejek[m]: Labrador is in india isn't he 
[10:21:35] <labrador> Tor[m], I sent the message at 12:09 so 9 mins after morning had ended. Sorry.
[10:21:51] <gtlsgamr> >Testing greentext. It works!
[10:21:55] <gtlsgamr> hm..
[10:21:59] <relejek[m]> labrador:  are you in IST though?
[10:22:05] <gtlsgamr> http://0x0.st/oPzj.png
[10:22:06] <Tor[m]> Yup
[10:22:15] <relejek[m]> > dose it work. green text
[10:22:18] <labrador> yeah ofc I am relejek[m]...why would I be in #gnulinuxindia otherwise
[10:22:20] <labrador> relejek[m], nah
[10:22:24] <relejek[m]> nope. lol 
[10:22:29] <labrador> 3>Boom yeah green text
[10:22:32] <labrador> That works
[10:22:39] <Tor[m]> Works on matrix
[10:23:11] <labrador> also gtlsgamr that greentext thing depends on your irc client
[10:23:17] <relejek[m]> labrador: here we do have some people from around the world. so it's best not to presume.
[10:23:34] <labrador> Hexchat has ctrl+k for inserting the colour(or kolour :p) control char
[10:23:38] <labrador> Then 3 for green
[10:24:16] <labrador> 3,4Can change the background too! Amazing isn't it?
[10:24:28] <labrador> oh ok relejek[m] 
[10:29:07] <Zbnssn[m]> <gtlsgamr> "http://0x0.st/oPzj.png" <- is this weechat?
[10:29:15] <AryaK[m]> <labrador> ">No in app audio or video..." <- matrix does have
[10:29:26] <AryaK[m]> they have their own 1-1 call system with turn and webrtc
[10:29:32] <AryaK[m]> and for group calls jitsi
[10:29:46] *** Joins: draco (~Zbnssn@49.36.111.147)
[10:29:53] <relejek[m]> labrador:  so yeah, what fascinates me about delta chat is that if you can securely host a email server than you have pretty secure chat system where delta chat acts a e2ee chat client by default. and a guy on matrix claims that they have done this ( can't confirm that though)
[10:29:55] <AryaK[m]> also they are working on a federated thing matrixvoip.dev
[10:30:02] <labrador> turn....isn't that the worse one that relays everything AryaK[m]?
[10:30:13] <labrador> That for nat hole punching sucks...too much load on the server
[10:30:24] <AryaK[m]> labrador: i dont understand what you are talking about
[10:31:10] <labrador> AryaK[m], TURN is traversal using relays around NAT
[10:31:11] <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> Well goolag is pretending that others should not be able to filter stuff out
[10:31:18] *** Quits: draco (~Zbnssn@49.36.111.147) (Client Quit)

[10:31:23] <relejek[m]> GNU/Drishal | Mi 11x (AliothIn) | Lighthouse | #ArchBtw | #EmacsForever:  why is this here again. haven't we debunked this due to lack of trustable sources.
[10:31:43] <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> relejek[m]: Point
[10:32:01] <labrador> relejek[m], uh why is this long list of things in front of your message?
[10:32:10] <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> Tbh I switched properly to microg now xD
[10:32:13] <labrador> <relejek[m]> GNU/Drishal | Mi 11x (AliothIn) | Lighthouse | #ArchBtw | #EmacsForever:  why
[10:32:18] <AryaK[m]> thats drishal
[10:32:23] <AryaK[m]> he is telegram user lol
[10:32:26] <labrador> oh
[10:32:41] <relejek[m]> labrador:  that's not me. it is a user tag for someone else here in the chat
[10:32:44] <Zbnssn[m]> GNUDrishal|Mi11x: android is inoperable without google play services ðŸ˜¢
[10:32:55] <labrador> Also relejek[m] it isn't that easy to setup a server....
[10:32:55] <Zbnssn[m]> like for day to day use
[10:32:58] <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> AryaK[m]: Custom rom communities are on telegram mostly
[10:33:05] <labrador> Like email servers are one of the hardest thing to setup
[10:33:12] <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> I am myself making Lighthouse OS for alioth
[10:33:13] <labrador> GNUDrishal|Mi11x, nah they're on xda devs
[10:33:31] * GNUDrishal|Mi11x uploaded an image: (49KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/t2bot.io/50f9908ae5a9e17cf333c6228e5d484a34f9fd49/image.jpeg >
[10:33:38] <relejek[m]> labrador:  dude it is quit easy to setup an email server if you wish to keep it as a closed service.
[10:33:42] <Zbnssn[m]> labrador: didnt luke smith made a script to do it all for you?
[10:33:42] <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> labrador: Nope everyone has mostly switched to teletram
[10:33:44] <labrador> also gtlsgamr your irc client looks beautiful!
[10:33:49] <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> s/teletram/telegram/
[10:34:23] <Zbnssn[m]> GNUDrishal|Mi11x: I did this shit so many times on a vanilla os with no google crap... didnt work at all... finally settled with flamegapps
[10:34:40] <labrador> relejek[m], there are so many components. Like SMTP SERVER+POP/IMAP SERVER+WEB CLIENT SERVER+SPAMASSASIN
[10:34:42] <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> Zbnssn[m]: Use bitgapps 
[10:34:42] <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> More lighter
[10:34:49] <labrador> Each of these things take time to setup and test
[10:35:04] <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> Me also thinking of coming back to goolag services BCS of soo many issues like WhatsApp not reading contacts
[10:35:24] <Zbnssn[m]> I used the lightest version of flamegapps it works and honestly I dont want to reflash the os
[10:35:36] <labrador> GNUDrishal|Mi11x, thats not really about google. Do you store your contacts on the android contact provider?
[10:35:38] <Zbnssn[m]> but thanks for suggestion will keep in mind
[10:35:46] <labrador> That is the only thing whatsapp can read
[10:35:48] <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> And i have to use whatscrap cause of my dad plus also college
[10:35:54] <Zbnssn[m]> same
[10:36:20] <Zbnssn[m]> have to add even whatsapp to magiskhide because during first login prompt it says you have a rooted device
[10:36:25] <AryaK[m]> luke has a script that autoconfigures everytyhinng right
[10:36:47] <Zbnssn[m]> Also magisk dev being bought by google is just so dystopic
[10:36:55] <labrador> AryaK[m], I wouldn't trust a script made by luke smith
[10:37:01] <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> labrador: Well I exported contacts from contacts.google.com first then imported to aosp contacts app 
[10:37:01] <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> It was causing issues
[10:37:01] <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> Then decided to export from takeout.google.com
[10:37:01] <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> Then it worked
[10:37:04] <labrador> Don't use weird third party scripts
[10:37:25] <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> * Well I exported contacts from contacts.google.com first then imported to aosp contacts app 
[10:37:25] <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> It was causing issues with WhatsApp unable to read contacts 
[10:37:25] <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> Then decided to export from takeout.google.com
[10:37:25] <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> Then it worked
[10:37:28] <labrador> GNUDrishal|Mi11x, oh you're next level man. Even when I used google i never used google contacts.
[10:37:45] <relejek[m]> labrador:  you can read those scripts it is not closed source.
[10:37:47] <labrador> Its hard to take stuff from google
[10:37:51] <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> labrador: How do you store contacts? ðŸ‘€
[10:37:58] <relejek[m]> you can trust what you can read right?
[10:38:02] <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> Sim card?
[10:38:06] <labrador> GNUDrishal|Mi11x, on the android contacts provider?
[10:38:08] <labrador> There too
[10:39:06] <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> labrador: I imported using aosp contacts
[10:39:30] <Zbnssn[m]> yeah same I use vanilla aosp contacts... syncs fine with whatsapp
[10:39:33] <labrador> relejek[m], and now tell me the odds of a person not able to configure server software who is able to read and understand luke smith's script ;)
[10:39:43] <Zbnssn[m]> I used to use simple contacts but it didnt sync
[10:39:49] <Drishal[m]> Zbnssn[m]: Me always had issues ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©
[10:39:53] <Zbnssn[m]> all contacts were just numbers
[10:40:02] <Drishal[m]> At one point i even felt like, screw this and move back to goolag lol
[10:40:13] <Drishal[m]> I now need to keep this vcf file safe and properly 
[10:40:44] <Zbnssn[m]> but it does funny stuff sometimes like completely deleting entire contacts and then I have find the vcf file in my backup on laptop
[10:41:08] <Drishal[m]> Zbnssn[m]: Omg something similar also happened lolz 
[10:41:41] <Drishal[m]> Android intentionally broke contacts and calanders without goolag services  ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©
[10:42:08] <Zbnssn[m]> truly not a smooth sailing experience
[10:42:51] <labrador> It never really happened to me ig
[10:43:17] <Zbnssn[m]> sometimes I wish I was an ignorant zoomer syncing all my photos to google drive instead of rsyncing them to a backup drive and encrypting the whole thing... only to later forgot the pass/key
[10:43:36] <Zbnssn[m]> forget*
[10:44:00] <labrador> Zbnssn[m], nice setup

[10:49:28] <Zbnssn[m]> Reminded me of an article back in the day where a student claimed he was offered from some b tech company probably Google to be a UX/UI designer or something and what he essentially that was used Photoshop(paint.exe) for the offer letter and it was a really bad edit

[10:51:15] <labrador> Zbnssn[m], lmao so much cringe
[10:51:32] <Zbnssn[m]> Later he got some legal troubles and he pretended to be mentally not stable saying that he suffered from psychosis because of the incident and accepted his fault

[14:34:54] <Klisper[m]> <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> "image.jpeg" <- plis send the 3rd
[14:34:55] <alphap> which statusbar you're using for dwm?
[14:35:02] <Drishal[m]> alphap: default one
[14:35:18] <Drishal[m]> and for displaying stuff, dwmblocks
[14:41:56] <Zbnssn[m]> <GNUDrishal|Mi11x> "All.my rices so far xD" <- how do u do that w emacs? I'm very new to it
[14:42:27] <Klisper[m]> seems like some package
[14:42:28] <Klisper[m]> the dashboard package probably
[14:43:06] <alphap> yes and there are packages for themes too
[14:44:24] <Drishal[m]> Klisper[m]: yes
[14:44:38] <Drishal[m]> check my config https://gitlab.com/drishal/dotfiles
[14:50:59] <AryaK[m]> codeberg > gitlab
[14:51:12] <AryaK[m]> gitlab.com is proprietary
[14:51:18] <AryaK[m]> gitlab CE which is community edition is foss
[14:51:27] <AryaK[m]> gitlab.com uses enterprise edition which is non-free
[14:51:57] <Klisper[m]> github is owned by microsoft
[14:52:25] <Klisper[m]> plus idk why would u buy gitlab enterprise unless its needed for a job
[14:54:08] <AryaK[m]> gitlab.com uses gitlab enterprise
[14:54:10] <AryaK[m]> which is non-free
[14:54:14] <Klisper[m]> i see
[14:54:19] <Klisper[m]> so send foss version
[14:54:21] <AryaK[m]> Klisper[m]: codeberg is fully free software forge
[14:54:28] <AryaK[m]> Klisper[m]: foss version has to be selfhosted
[14:54:35] <Klisper[m]> Kewl
[14:55:05] <AryaK[m]> codeberg.org uses gitea with their own (libre) additions
[14:55:17] <Klisper[m]> whats gitea
[14:55:20] <AryaK[m]> like pages support was implemented by them
[14:55:25] <AryaK[m]> but you can use it in your own gitea instance
[14:55:28] <AryaK[m]> Klisper[m]: gitea.org
[14:55:42] <AryaK[m]> * gitea.io
[14:55:48] <Klisper[m]> nice
[14:55:58] <AryaK[m]> its like gitlab
[14:56:02] <AryaK[m]> but fully libre
[14:56:51] <Klisper[m]> nicee

[15:25:33] <labrador> AryaK[m], gitlab CE is a bitch to host
[15:25:47] <labrador> But on the contrary its features are miles ahead compared to gitea

[15:46:01] <Klisper[m]> Users of the software will be immune to attacks that would result in censorship of others

[18:01:51] <alphap> kernel random interfaces? what does it mean?
[18:02:55] <labrador> alphap, you could open the link (;__;) That basically means any function or "file" that gets entropy from the kernel's pool.
[18:03:18] <labrador> Like files might be /dev/random or /dev/urandom.
