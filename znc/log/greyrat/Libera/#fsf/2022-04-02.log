[00:00:00] <isf> 1 you can modify the second only run nonfree software
[00:00:09] <Noisytoot> You said "phone", not "mobile phone"
[00:00:16] <isf> so, always even if you have a librem always you run nonfree software with it
[00:00:22] <isf> ok, but that is a possibility,
[00:00:26] <isf> not a  reality
[00:00:35] <isf> the reality is you run nonfree software in your phone
[00:00:58] <isf> always, i never know people who are in free software who run a nonfree software who are realy against it or realy say no to it
[00:01:13] <isf> and i can recognice a lot of ways to try to argument why they do it
[00:01:22] <isf> for justify it
[00:02:02] <isf> but in free distros, i can see something different the users always are against and always say no to nonfree software or more than the opensource users or users of nonfree distros
[00:02:22] <isf> a example bigger is Richard Stallman, who use the same distro i use
[00:02:41] <isf> and a lot of users take the example of him and dont run nonfree software, and run free distros
[00:02:56] <Noisytoot> Are you still talking about whether or not it is possible to use a non-FSDG-compliant distro without running nonfree software?
[00:03:08] <qrpnxz> complete loss of freedom is i get put into solitary confinement in prison forever. Check your hyperbole
[00:04:11] <Noisytoot> It's just as possible to have a mobile phone and run Trisquel as it is to have a mobile phone and run Debian. It doesn't affect whether or not Debian is free.
[00:04:13] <Noisytoot> Also, https://osmocom.org/
[00:04:14] <isf> i cant recognice any justification has a moral or ethic for say yes to run nonfree software in your computing so, sorry but for me the objetive is clear
[00:04:42] <qrpnxz> the ethic question is producing non-free software
[00:04:54] <isf> if you dont want do steps in your freedom ladder, the good issue that dont affect me

[00:05:07] <qrpnxz> you have no idea what step i've taken
[00:05:21] <isf> sadly, the example you do with others running nonfree distros is a welcome to propietary software
[00:05:22] <qrpnxz> i'm like a mile up everyone i know, but you act like i'm in handcuffs
[00:05:39] <jacobk> isf: I use Trisquel but I don't always say no to nonfree software. Trisquel does not provide nonfree software, but any user can install nonfree software if they want. Using a FSDG-compliant distro is neither necessary nor sufficient for complete freedom, IMO.

[02:49:07] <belgin> romania is pretty socialist too. lately, neoliberals are trying to privatize everything and it's interesting because you can hear the language changing in the media. the narative is not about choosing the right person to vote anymore, it's about how private companies do things oh so much more efficiently than the government
[02:49:52] <belgin> and that sounds plausible, but read the book "bullshit jobs" and you'll see how most people in the private sector think their job is useless or just show up to pretend to work

[04:19:05] <madage> qrpnxz: I kept thinking about those vultures and the dirty strategies and pseudo arguments they will employ against free software and I think we are bound to face that very early on as soon as our ideals get the tiniest public attention, so we'll need to be prepared to face them. The educative videos are one way, but I also think we have much to gain by making free software ideas more interseccional with 
[04:19:11] <madage> other social causes. Eg. we need to raise awareness amongst other activist groups on how free software is crucial to their activism, since if they do not control their computing they are bound to be easy prey to those opposing them

[09:37:07] <kompowiec2> I do not know if I mentioned, but the EU wants to introduce the DMA act which, among others is to force the creators of instant messaging to develop one common standard. Yay

[09:41:25] <kompowiec2> I don't think this will affect free software. Probably it will be the same as before, so everyone will be able to create their own protocols and bridges to them.

[10:07:03] <Andrew> kompowiec2: Who decides which standard protocol we use?  And, a protocol that you like (such as XMPP) might be hated by others for (1) its bloated use of XML, while a simpler text protocol should be used (2) its inscalability of MUCs and the lack of proper multicast and fake spanning trees (3) you must parse the XML before you can split them properly into TCP frames and avoid desync issues, and
[10:07:06] <Andrew> parsing XML is slow, etc 
[10:07:14] <Andrew> My point is not to say that XMPP is bad, there are use-cases for it
[10:07:27] <Andrew> But some developers, like me, just dislike how it works
[10:07:57] <kompowiec2> > Per Schwab, messenger services that are subject to the interoperability requirement will have to open up their APIs for competitors to provide interoperable messaging for basic features — with the requirement intentionally asymmetrical, meaning that smaller messaging services that are not in the scope of the DMA will not be required to open up to gatekeepers but can themselves connect into Big Tech.
[10:07:58] <kompowiec2> https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/24/dma-political-agreement/
[10:08:01] <Andrew> Mandating a standard protocol is tyrannical, mandating free specifications is nice
[10:08:39] <Andrew> That sounds like they just need to free their APIs and publish specs, which I agree with
[10:09:04] <kompowiec2> so from what i understand they just want to extend what already existed. Independent programmers could create their own skype clients but this was limited.
[10:09:42] <Andrew> That sounds good, but do they mandate that the APIs must be free software?

[10:12:47] <kompowiec2> > From Moglen (2017)[8] one can draw the consideration that there is need for things that work in a reasonable basic level, which are stable, standardized and get the basic job done even in the most limited environment. From the same reference, there is no longer time to recommend an incomplete solution and say that it will get better as "we" thinker with it and that people should just "massively use it already". This is not 
[10:12:47] <kompowiec2> to say that the development of other solutions must be abandoned. What should be done is instead to recommend already stable solutions to the general public, and leave the unstable ones to people who really get interested on helping out.

[10:15:16] <Andrew> kompowiec2: I do recommend XMPP to newbies, and sometimes Matrix, but interoperbility in those protocols with others (such as IRC and IDC) are extremely crucial to me, because interacting with a technically bad protocol (in my opinion) feels uncomfortable.  Anyways, I do recommend normies XMPP because it's widely used, and does not have ethical problems (mostly).
[10:15:39] <kompowiec2> same :)
[10:16:01] <Andrew> I don't hate XMPP and Matrix (unless if you use matrix.org or something), they're ethically okay, I just dislike how the technology and the specs are specifically
[10:16:10] <Andrew> So even though I really dislike XML, I still have my own XMPP server
[10:16:15] <kompowiec2> with one exception, where i sometimes use skype as "last resort" otherwise i cut off contact.

[10:19:43] <Andrew> How is it possible to connect to Skype?
[10:19:48] <Andrew> What protocol do they use?
[10:20:34] <Andrew> I thought that Skype uses nonfree protocols
[10:20:37] <kompowiec2> they use own skype protocol (which was P2P before it was taken over by microsoft) and if you want paid, SIP
[10:21:01] <Andrew> "which was P2P before it was taken over by microsoft"
[10:21:09] <Andrew> can you still host your own Skype serv er, or however it works?
[10:21:57] <Andrew> In theory more people use Matrix than XMPP
[10:22:21] <Andrew> ~~Anything that isn't IDC is a bad protocol imo~~
[10:22:21] <kompowiec2> rather, the company that made Skype didn't have the resources to create it as a client-server so it was using other users' public IP addresses to be able to connect them with other users who are behind NAT ... a long story.
[10:23:01] <kompowiec2> can you bring this IDC with any link, I can't find anything in the DDG?

[14:49:51] <leah> the free software mentality, that is. though i've used free software since 2005
[14:50:54] <leah> prior to 2009 though, i dualbooted with windows. from 2009 onwards, i ditched proprietary software altogether and made strides to free myself more thoroughly. i learned about the lemote yeeloong computer around that time too, it's one of the things that later inspired me when i found out about coreboot
[14:51:11] <leah> that's all people really need. inspiration. someone to show them the way
[14:51:20] <Andrew> and when did you start LB?
[14:51:30] <leah> technically, february 2014
[14:51:50] <leah> work started in december 2013 but was called coreboot-libre back then
[14:52:21] <leah> and i started working with coreboot in around june 2013, but had no plans to do anything like libreboot at that time
[14:53:54] <leah> > broken gtt. psychedelic graphical corruption on the screen. constant crashes. on an x60 with coreboot's libre video init, before it was stable. that was june 2013
[14:54:11] <leah> yet i remember that first coreboot machine (x60 that had average uptime of 12 hours) fondly
[14:54:27] <leah> (windows 95 was more stable lol)
[14:55:15] <leah> video init on x60 back then was based on strace of linux kernel doing video init
[14:55:38] <leah> literally if you look at that old code, it looks like assembly language masquerading as C. lots of stuff hardcoded, poorly
[14:56:17] <leah> coreboot did execution trace of video init on i915 and tweaked it into working (but unstable) C code
