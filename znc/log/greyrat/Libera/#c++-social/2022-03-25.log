[13:42:39] <Faux> Many people don't even explicitly upgrade.
[13:42:59] <Faux> i.e. depend on a docker image named `alpine:3.14-latest` and just take whatever comes.
[13:43:06] <Faux> (hi I work at a dependency management company)
[13:43:07] <jotham> yeah i feel like i'm an exotic weirdo for running a version upgrade in a non prod environment before deploying to prod
[13:43:15] <jotham> for a week or two
[13:43:45] <ERROH> we on the other hand never upgrade

[13:43:57] <ERROH> well, we sometimes have to
[13:45:12] <jotham> i'm running an ancient node inside a docker on an api server because they cbf upgrading the 5 year old code

[13:47:39] <Faux> I'm currently considering writing a load of code which a library could do for me, because the library makes ld take like 4 extra seconds, and I can't face it.

[14:50:54] <T`aZ> i dont remember the story, but having gone through this covid hysteria, worldwide people were completely fucked up, and will not hesitate one second to be mean, remove your rights, whish your death, just because you happen to disagree with some of their (imposed) views
[14:51:01] <jotham> sage goes well with chorizo and squash
[14:51:07] <jotham> i crisped up the chorizo first
[14:51:21] <jotham> this week was shit, so had to do something to cheer myself up
[14:51:55] <jotham> yeast flake vinaigrette is banging

[15:08:08] <ERROH> there's a pizza place on the other side of city that does chorizo with honey
[15:08:28] <ERROH> p. much the only time i drive for pizza myself as they're too far for delivery 
[15:08:31] <jotham> yeah it varies a lot
[15:08:39] <jotham> i like to cut it quite finely 
[15:08:47] <jotham> usually cold as i can from the fridge, so it cuts well
[15:08:49] <jotham> with a sharp knife
[15:08:53] <jotham> then fry it off on its own
[15:08:56] <jotham> till it gets osme colour
[15:09:02] <jotham> then add it back at the end of the dish
[15:09:23] <jotham> where i used to live my butcher made them as raw uncured/unsmoked sausages
[15:09:30] <jotham> and i used to smoke them in my charcoal grill
[15:09:33] <jotham> for 3-4 hours
[15:09:36] <jotham> was really good

[15:13:10] <jotham> they courier over in a cool-box
[15:13:17] <jotham> but it's the only way to get decent meat

[16:04:00] <MaNI> chorizo is very hit and miss because the shops like to sell something completely different to what the good restaurants are using
[16:04:14] <jotham> yep
[16:04:21] <jotham> my best mate and i are very fussy about it
[16:04:25] <jotham> like with all sausage
[16:04:30] <jotham> there is a heap of junk wrapped up as food
[16:04:37] <jotham> i mean that might even be the theory of operation of a sausage
[16:04:39] <jotham> haha
[16:04:51] <jotham> i recently started smoking some of those long curly south african sausages MaNI 
[16:04:54] <jotham> in the last 2-3  years
[16:05:03] <jotham> and have realised fat content and spice content varies wildly
[16:05:09] <jotham> but a good one with a nice bit of a wood smoke
[16:05:13] <jotham> is incredible and moist
[16:05:19] <jotham> brits could learn a thing or two
[16:05:24] <MaNI> long curly south african sausages? do you mean wors?
[16:05:28] <jotham> yeah
[16:05:36] <jotham> i am pretty fussy about sausage as a food but i am here to try them all
[16:06:00] <jotham> i didn't want to say boerworst incase it was some weird anglo term
[16:06:05] <MaNI> yeah theres no real standard for that stuff you get 100s of different varieties
[16:06:06] <jotham> which is how it's called here
[16:06:10] <jotham> yep
[16:06:24] <jotham> what most kiwis eat as sausage offends me
[16:06:26] <jotham> quite often precooked

[16:06:41] <MaNI> boerewors is the correct name, you won't have an angry afrikaaner trying to punish you for the boer war if you call it that

[16:32:25] <jotham> but it's more complicated than that
[16:32:37] <jotham> because capitalism has taken that to a terrible extreme
