My bluetooth earphone and my DAP both support LDAC, but i could not choose LDAC as an option without installing pulseaudios-modules-bt (which should no longer be needed since pulseaudio 15). On the search for the error i was told to install pipewire, now the sound is even worse.
[01:36:41] <Vamp898> Since i installed pipewire, it insists that neither my Headphones nor my DAP are supporting A2DP at all and so fallback to the horrible HFP profile

[03:05:38] <raster> feral_hedgehog: fonts are such a tiny minimal part of a theme... barely worth considering :)
[03:06:56] <Namarrgon> icar: there's a large mess of unsupported/incomplete features between wayland, xwayland, mesa and vaapi that constantly shifts and breaks
[03:06:59] <raster> but yes- choosing some massive font can totally break a lot of assumptions on what a ui may lay out like. reality is most people who make a ui think directly. ie - pretty much you paint/draw it and it stays like that. eg fixed. they may then be able to expand a bit and handle scaling where everything scales up and down the same amount. it really now is "just design at a very high res and scale it down" if youw ant 
[03:06:59] <raster> quality (or well vectors - same result in the end)
[03:07:38] <feral_hedgehog> I wish they'd just announce that custom themes are unsupported or something, but still read the damn config
[03:07:39] <raster> but then you have to leap to the next level which is resizability on top of sclability - which parts of your ui stretch/tile/epxand when a window or screen is resized but not scaled? that is a pretty big leap for ui designers already.
[03:07:54] <rcf> feral_hedgehog: the problem is that if they are unsupported... who is maintaining the config? 
[03:08:05] <feral_hedgehog> Like Sway running on Nvidia for example - sure everything spazzes out like crazy, but I can still run the thing!

[03:11:16] <raster> add that to the mix oc variable content based on data, also scaling, resizing .. and that is just the start. what if a theme adds lot sof padding around buttons or other elements that varies the layout? even more fun if some content is drawn by an app - it has to draw some marker or whatwever .. how does it make this "marker" look like it belongs? if your theme is simpel and flat vs if its looks like maboo and vines vs 
[03:11:16] <raster> geiger alien stuff etc. ... how do you even begin to express that? it's tough... really tough and it almost always falls apart somewhere even if you account for all the "what if"'s.

[05:47:07] <uuidNuniq> use the patch and rebuild unyu 
[05:47:20] <uuidNuniq> it is a good time to learn pkgbuild and makepkg
[05:47:47] <uuidNuniq> and asp 
[05:48:12] <uuidNuniq> and updpkgsums
[05:48:15] <jonathon> (also, if it hasn't already been done, report upstream so someone who can easily replicate the problem has made the report)
[05:48:22] <unyu> I'm going to do that. Thanks!
[05:48:27] <unyu> uuidNuniq: ^
[05:48:39] <jonathon> nice :)
[05:49:00] <uuidNuniq> basically, you asp export moc 
[05:49:36] <uuidNuniq> and then, download the patch, edit the PKGBUILD file and add the patch to the list. and run updpkgsums to update the checksums in PKGBUILD
[05:49:44] <uuidNuniq> and makepkg -ef 
[05:49:48] <uuidNuniq> and makepkg -sf
[05:49:57] <unyu> It isn't too different from building AUR packages, right?
[05:50:02] <jonathon> it's the same
[05:50:34] <Baphomet> How could I search and retrieve human-readable info from AUR packages on console?

[12:37:37] <anodesni> Hi, I try to add my wireguard connection to NetworkManager. I ran "nmcli connection import type wireguard file /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf" and made sure that the kernel module "wireguard" is loaded. However, the connection only shows up with nmcli or nm-connection-editor, but it is not visible in the nm-applet. Should I do an additional step?

[12:38:07] <SCHAPiE> Woohoo, solved my unbound + systemd-resolved issue. I was performing DNSSEC verification twice. And since recently the second verification attempts started breaking (in systemd-resolved), still not sure why though. But disabling it there solved my intermittent DNS lookup failures.

[19:22:55] <oramirite> I've been learning about PKGBUILD files the past week and have created one for my project succesfully. I notice that almost all PKGBUILDs are in seperate repos from their source, including packages that are distributed by the same maintainers as the source. If I am the author of a project as well as the PKGBUILD are there any disadvantages to simply having a PKGBUILD in the root of my source? I'm sure there are 
[19:22:55] <oramirite> drawbacks I'd jus be interested in hearing opinions and history behind it.

[19:26:35] <oramirite> That's quite fair :P To be honest the only reason I wrote a PKGBUILD is to conveniently include a tree of files in an archiso. So while it COULD be distributed someday, it's not exactly intended for that right now. But I may have just answered my own question? Keep it seperate in case it does end up on the AUR?
[19:26:56] <Edu4rdSHL> Well, current firefox in the repos is 97.0.2 and according to the mozilla advisory, it's fixed there
