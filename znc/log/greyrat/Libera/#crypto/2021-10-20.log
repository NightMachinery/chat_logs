[00:57:38] <sarnold> if it were my problem to solve I'd poke around in https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/ for a while
[00:57:39] <Alipha> It looks like base64 encoding, if you just ignore the *
[00:58:00] <sarnold> maybe convert the numbers to hex, encode that to binary, then base64 the mess
[00:58:04] <thelounge4664> thats what i thought as well
[00:58:21] <thelounge4664> when i tried to b64 decode it says invalid
[00:58:32] <sarnold> there's hundreds of simple little transforms like that that are simple enough to play with that might get results without really thinking about it
[00:59:27] <Alipha> Did you exclude the *?
[01:00:12] <thelounge4664> Yeah

[01:51:34] <ms7821> your best bet is to compare similar values, e.g. ones that differ by 1, or 1000, or 1024
[01:52:24] <ms7821> it might actually be encrypted
[01:54:10] *** Quits: b93 (~I@87.196.81.16) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[01:54:47] <ms7821> the fact that there's 1 = suggests it's actually 02NBsPqk4q8= etc that's encoded
[01:56:03] <ms7821> which would give you d3 69 c1 03 61 b9 f3 71, d3 63 41 b0 fa a4 e2 af, and d3 69 db 6d 2b 44 ac 91
[01:56:34] <ms7821> oops, swap the last two
[01:58:16] <ms7821> so you might have a 4-byte timestamp/counter, and 4-byte encrypted version of value, or 2 byte counter, 4 byte encrypted value and 2 byte checksum

[19:18:19] <guest30> Im running ubuntu
[19:20:30] <ioxzev1z> cryptsetup can (iirc) convert plaintext data to encrypted data
[19:20:38] <ioxzev1z> So "man cryptsetup"
[19:21:08] <Haohmaru> isn't that sort of thing done another way.. via using encrypted partitions and functionalities that the OS provides?
[19:21:24] <Haohmaru> or do you need a one-time thing
[19:21:39] *** Joins: bufferman (c11b0e4d@67.205.143.82)
[19:21:39] <riv> you can't do that in place
[19:21:50] <riv> youll need to copy it into a new HDD
[19:22:05] <Haohmaru> yeah it's too late to change your filesystem..
[19:22:16] <riv> or if the HD is partitioned, you can use an empty partition (if there is one)
[19:22:27] <ioxzev1z> riv man cryptsetup, /reencrypt, specifically "device encryption (reencrypt --encrypt)"
[19:22:44] <Haohmaru> i'm just asking what the intended effect is
[19:23:07] <aczid> sounds like a good way to accidentally destroy data if you don't know what you're doing
[19:23:11] <Haohmaru> if he wants to just temporarily obscure the data, then that's not what he wants
[19:23:32] <riv> ioxzev1z: does reencryption just change the cipher on an already set up encrypted disk?
[19:25:09] *** Quits: chiselfuse (~chiselfus@user/chiselfuse) (Remote host closed the connection)
[19:25:58] <dostoyevsky2> I went through some CISSP study notes and it noted that assymetric cryptography is generally 100 to 1000 times slower than symmetric -- is that still true these days?  Seems a bit high 
[19:26:51] <ioxzev1z> dostoyevsky2, asymmetric is fairly slow, so 100 - 1000 wouldn't surprise me, but pretty much everyone uses hybrid encryption so you're only doing ASYMe(SYm_key)
[19:27:19] <ioxzev1z> guest30, Not sure about your situation but I'm sure it's possible to apply encryption without format
[19:27:29] <ioxzev1z> guest30, but do some research before you try something
[19:27:54] <guest30> Mmm id like to encrypt, but not lose data..
[19:28:13] <Haohmaru> then make sure you have backups
[19:28:18] <dostoyevsky2> ioxzev1z: yeah, in that signing code I use I create a sha512 hash digest of a message which I then sign with an RSA private key... and that digest will then be verified on the other side with the public key
[19:29:45] <ioxzev1z> dostoyevsky2, sure, but if you're doing something like RSAe(m, pub_key); where m is big (1GiB, etc), you probably want c = AESe(m, key), key_rsa = RSAe(key), msg = c & key_rsa or something
[19:30:12] <guest30> Haohmaru but i would like those backups encrypted too..
[19:30:43] <riv> i think the best thing is get a new HD, encrypt it and copy everything onto that. then you can wipe the original disk, encrypt it and copy the data on to have a backup
[19:31:03] <riv> although if reencrypt does handle this case, that is very useful
[19:31:09] <riv> i can't really figure out if it does
[19:31:31] <Haohmaru> guest30 then encrypt onto another HDD, after that compare that the HDD matches the intended encrypted data
[19:31:45] <bufferman> Can someone help me figure out what these are and how to actually decrypt them? I have both examples of encrypted and decrypted values. Willing to pay with cryptocurrency if needed. Link for the examples: https://paste.debian.net/plainh/dc1b3b43
[19:32:34] <riv> bufferman: ending in = or == suggests base64
[19:32:59] <riv> i tested and that seems wrong
[19:33:08] <riv> so it's probably something similar to base64
[19:33:11] <bufferman> I've been told it's weak/shitty.
[19:33:20] <bufferman> It could be modified or something, I don't know.
[19:34:41] *** Quits: Pythayr (~pither195@64.42.181.51) (Remote host closed the connection)
[19:37:41] <Wulf> if it were base64, "1900-01-14" (10 chars) would encode as 16 chars. Not 26.
[19:38:08] <Wulf> Lines 2 and 3 differ in one bit only, but encrypted has lots of differences.
[19:39:03] <Wulf> 1900 and 1903 have the same first three chars, so they would encode the same in base64. Doesn't here.
[19:39:51] <Wulf> last char before == is always one of gwAQ. Which does suggest it's base64.
[19:40:22] <ioxzev1z> Given that they all start similar I don't think they're encrypted with a real cipher
[19:40:33] <ioxzev1z> As it would look random even if they were only a few bits apart
[19:41:17] <Wulf> My guess is: First two chars *0 or *1 define the format, e.g. String vs. Integer. Remainder is actual base64. But no idea how to clear text is encoded into the binary-before-base64.
[19:43:13] *** Joins: aleck (~aleck@user/aleck)
[19:43:54] <bufferman> ioxzev1z: I see. I don't think it's encryption either. More like a hash or encoded values. But I require the formula how to get to those values shown in the examples.
[19:44:32] <bufferman> Wulf: Very helpful information. That kinda does make sense. Sadly I don't have anything else but samples, and those are only a couple. I have more if you want to take a look at it.
[19:44:32] <Wulf> bufferman: what's the context of this puzzle? Where did you get it from?
[19:45:36] <Wulf> encoded data appears to be multiple of 8 bytes. The number examples at the bottom have 8 encoded bytes (not counting the *1) but 9 decimal digits. So my guess about special integer format may fit.

[20:45:43] <maroon> well it's not rijndael since that normally has a 128-bit 16-byte block, while your shortest example looks like encoding of a much shorter string. rijndael192 would have 24-byte chunks
[20:46:03] <maroon> do you have any example strings where the character after the * is not 0 or 1?

[20:49:28] <maroon> this code mentions CFB, but this doesnt look like it's CFB-mode because that doesnt need to include the padding, which means the cipertext can be the same length as the input instead of padding to multiple of 8 bytes or whatever the block length is
[20:55:44] <bufferman> I see.
[20:55:52] <bufferman> maroon: I'll check.
[20:56:10] <bufferman> Also, any chance of it being a DES block cipher or maybe even HMAC‐SHA1?
[20:58:33] <maroon> it looks like base64 encoding of <something> that's always a size that's a multiple of 8. and it can fit a 9-digit number into an encoding block of 8 by having the plaintext be 0x435624606 instead of text "435624606", which can be confirmed if 12 zeroes is still the short string with the 1st digit 1, while 9 X's would be the longer string like those dates
[20:59:00] <maroon> it looks like ECB mode of a 64-bit cipher, so could be DES or even blowfish
[20:59:56] <maroon> it's not hmac, because the first 8 chars of the string being the same are encoding as the same
[21:03:34] <maroon> and hmac is an authentication hash, so it doesn't decrypt unless you have some weird mode where you XOR an HMAC stream against a plaintext
[21:04:06] *** Joins: byteskeptical (~amnesia@user/byteskeptical)
[21:04:50] <maroon> also if im right about how it is storing numbers as integers 18446744073709551615 should be a short encoding and 18446744073709551616 the long one

[21:07:38] <bufferman> I understand. I guess you're right. I just tried guessing though.
[21:10:04] <bufferman> maroon hold up I got more examples

[21:10:37] <ioxzev1z> maroon, "rijndael192 would have 24-byte chunks" doesn't rijndael always use 16 byte blocks, but the _key_ can be e.g. 192 bits (24 bytes)?
[21:11:49] <maroon> " Block sizes of 128, 160, 192, 224, and 256 bits are supported by the Rijndael algorithm for each key size, but only the 128-bit block size is specified in the AES standard."
[21:12:03] <ioxzev1z> oic, was thinking of aes then
[21:13:17] <maroon> though their mention of rijndael 192 probably did mean the key size, but 192 is so rare as a key size, that i thought of the rijndael's quirk

[21:49:21] <hendursaga> How might I convert a 5d6 dice roll into letters + punctuation/whatever?
[21:49:48] <riv> are the dice rolls ordered?
[21:50:31] *** Joins: qbt (~qbt@user/edun)
[21:51:34] <hendursaga> Perhaps? Basically I have 5 brand-new casino dice and I'm wondering if I could turn that into some manual sort of cryptographic entropy
[21:51:41] <ioxzev1z> hendursaga, yeah
[21:51:48] <ioxzev1z> use eff dice list or diceware
[21:51:50] <riv> so you have a length 5 base 6 sequence, you can convert it as an integer to a (much shorter) base 26+extra sequence maybe
[21:52:06] <ioxzev1z> nvm thought you wanted passwords
[21:52:25] <hendursaga> ioxzev1z: yeah I already use diceware for other things :)
[21:53:38] <hendursaga> riv: so basically some sort of chart where 111111 = a, 111112 = b, etc?
[21:54:05] <riv> more of a formula than a chart but yeah
[21:54:44] <hendursaga> OK that makes sense, great
[21:54:59] <Alipha> If ordered, 2 dice will give you 36 possibilities, which 26 letters + 10 other characters might be a little tight
[21:55:33] <hendursaga> Alipha: by ordered, you mean one after the other? I'm rolling all five at once, so...
[21:55:34] <Alipha> 3 dice would be 6^3, or 216, which would be plenty
[21:55:45] <Alipha> hendursaga: are they different colors?
[21:55:55] <hendursaga> no, they are all the same
[21:56:01] <riv> if you roll them all at once, it's a little bit more difficult
[21:56:19] <ioxzev1z> Line them up after the roll and read left to right+
[21:56:20] <ioxzev1z> ?
[21:56:23] <riv> there are fewer different results
[21:56:47] <riv> yeah that could work
[21:57:36] <hendursaga> so in the end it's in base 30?
[21:58:35] <Alipha> Unordered 4 dice would be 6^4/4! or 54? That seems wrong
[22:00:25] <maroon> ordered means you have a red and a blue dice, and the result is red * 6 + blue * 1
[22:00:28] <ioxzev1z> You have 11111 to 66666, so just roll the five dice against a wall or in a box, read left to right, then just either swap each digit with something or each set of five digits as in diceware
[22:01:24] <ioxzev1z> Or use motion, like that one place that watched a wall of moving lava lamps for entropy
[22:01:34] <hendursaga> ioxzev1z: that was Cloudflare
[22:02:41] <ioxzev1z> I'm guessing that watching 5 dice randomly get thrown on a piece of white paper should give a decent amount of entropy
[22:03:01] <hendursaga> casino-grade dice, anyways
[22:04:15] <maroon> as long as you roll them 1 at a time, or they're 5 different colors to tell them apart
[22:04:46] <hendursaga> maroon: why one at a time? just line 'em up??

[22:27:27] <maroon> true, didnt think of it since i didnt have 5 dice to actually try it out
[22:30:57] <hendursaga> I still feel something's off... can't put my finger on it..
[22:33:09] <maroon> look at it this way, if you have 3 10-sided dice with the numbers 0-9 on the different faces, you see how that can randomly give you 1000 (10^3) different outcomes 000-999?
[22:33:43] <maroon> as long as you don't have bias in using the dice low-to-high

[22:45:16] <ms7821> bufferman: your pastes have expired already, but I had a brief look at your samples yesterday and it definitely looks like a 64-bit cipher, so there'll be a key somewhere
[22:45:58] <bufferman> ms7821 I can send again.
[22:46:16] <bufferman> maroon also helped a lot
[22:47:19] <maroon> i started out thinking the common beginnings meant ECB mode, but the lack of collisions in the 2nd block makes me think CBC with a fixed IV

[23:38:25] <Alipha> Yes, it'll be fine if you pick some order (eg, left to right) after you roll
[23:39:15] <Alipha> Though you'll run into situations where it'll be subjective whether a die is to the left of another die or not
[23:42:34] <iz> but will that matter?
[23:46:09] <ms7821> as long as your decision is independent of the number, nope
[23:46:37] <iz> yeah, that's what i thought, but wasn't sure
[23:49:49] <Alipha> Well, I suspect the ordering for duce "too close to tell" may be (at least, subconsciously) influenced by the values on the dice :-) though in the grand scheme of things, it really doesn't matter, heh
