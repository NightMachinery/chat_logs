[00:00:37] <leftyfb> gabriel: try #ubuntu-devel
[00:01:01] <gabriel> I send this feedback to whoever is developing the dock (Unity type) on Ubuntu Mate. Note that there is an incongruity between dark mode and light mode. The blank panel bar is really annoying and annoying, and doesn't make any incongruity with the theme. For those who don't use dark mode, like me and hundreds of people, the most appropriate thing would be to leave the panel contrasting with the dock in black. Attached are the
[00:01:01] <gabriel> images. Thanks. ;D

[03:23:52] <sers> The scenario is the following, a windows10 system was installed on a drive, roughly half the space of the drive for the win10-partition, afterwards, ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS was installed from the LIVE DVD, occupying the rest of the space of the drive. Now, upon only reinstalling ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS thru the installer from the LIVE DVD, leaving windows 10 intact, the unbuntu installer creates after each new install
[03:23:59] <sers> of ubuntu, a new W95 FAT32 537MB /dev/whatever* partition. Now after reinstalling ubuntu multiple times, leaving the windows OS untouched, there are now multiple W95 FAT32 parititions, which mostly only contain $RECYCLE.BIN and System Volume Information folders, and occupy roughly 20,5 kB, and only in the last 295 FAT32 partition mounted at /boot/efi and the necessarly files stored created by the ubuntu
[03:24:05] <sers> installer...
[03:24:50] <sers> Now, do I need these newly created partitions which only contain said windows files or what would happen if I were to remove them via ubuntu discs and source the grub files afterwards?
[03:24:52] <sarnold> it might be way easier to pastebin the output from cfdisk or something
[03:25:16] <sers> probably right, but I'd rather now want to post sensitive information :)

[03:25:44] <sarnold> no

[06:49:41] <lilgopher> apparently if you do "sudo apt install docker" you install docker and wmdocker

[06:50:48] <JackFrost> It's not the only one though, testssl.sh is another (great) package with a bit of a weird name.

[07:02:22] <sarnold> lilgopher: and getting new developers into debian isn't the easiest task..
[07:02:35] <lilgopher> interesting
[07:02:48] <sarnold> lilgopher: so, debian's mostly composed of packages that debian maintainers use, and they only use stuff that's packaged, so there's not a lot of pressure to get shiny *new* things into debian
[07:03:12] <jhutchins> There have to be people who are interested in the package, interested in developing packages for Ubuntu, and possibly interested in developing packages for Debian.
[07:03:36] <jhutchins> lilgopher: You can always build it yourself.  If you get good at it, you can submit a package for consideration.
[07:04:04] <jhutchins> A package may be great, but if it's of no interest to developers it'll never go anywhere.

[14:08:27] <cbreak> usb sticks don't need a special driver on linux.
[14:09:01] <Frost_> cbreak : shes using an old kernel then
[14:10:08] <Sunrise> It's 18.04
[14:10:22] <Frost_> Sunrise : i meant the linux kernel
[14:10:33] <Frost_> Sunrise : i dont think 5.4 is in the repos
[14:11:03] <Sunrise> Frost_: so it can't recognize the usb stick?
[14:11:24] <cbreak> ... linux has supported USB storage for ages...
[14:11:34] <Frost_> Sunrise : Probably yes, what is the creation date?
[14:11:39] <gebbione> Frost_, in short the answer is no. Ie i can connect the device but and i can see it. I can probably drag songs one by one but no i cannot go on a playlist in Rhythmbox and say to sync it to device XYZ

[15:48:51] <goddard> depends on how you are communicating
[15:49:05] <goddard> first you should never need to set rw on all
[15:49:24] <goddard> second if your user is set properly whne you boot the docker image it should just work with its mounts

[15:50:28] <sloth_on_meth> what exactly do you mean by 'if your user is set properly'?
[15:50:49] <goddard> docker has a root user

[19:46:15] <ueberall> Hi. Is there a way to express the equivalent of "/sbin/ethtool -s eth0 wol ug" in a Netplan .yaml file? "wakeonlan: true" didn't reliably work during tests (explicitly executing "netplan apply" after boot worked "somewhat", but it would only change 'd'->'g', not 'ug') on Ubuntu Focal.
[19:47:10] <ueberall> (A workaround was to create a "oneshot" service wol.service which executed the above ethtool command at boot time, but shouldn't Netplan be able to do the same?)

[21:48:31] <jhutchins> nemo: I'd probably dig a little further before trying anything, but you might purge all of the CIFS client files, make sure you clean up any hidden keys and ids, purge any reference to that workstation from the server's records and try again from scratch.

[21:52:23] <nemo> jhutchins: BTW, the reason we are on HWE 5.13 was because there's a pretty bad CIFS bug that was causing reliable kernel panics in 5.4 - we were testing this in our test env to see if 5.13 at least no longer panicked against this windows server. it's not panicking, but then, it's not mounting either ☺

[21:55:37] <jhutchins> nemo: Did you go throgh the process of joining the machine to the CIFS network after the update?  I think that's where the key is generated.
[21:55:56] <nemo> sarnold: I'd have to dig up the panic again, but it seems related to CIFS badly handling disconnects

[23:54:46] <leftyfb> thunder: install it
[23:54:48] <sarnold> I wonder if it's backed by a zfs?
[23:54:50] <thunder> k. 1 sec
[23:55:15] <leftyfb> xfs on top of zfs ... gross

[23:55:56] <leftyfb> thunder: this is storage is abstracted multiple times, I don't think you're going to get much performance out of xfs. Why bother with it?

[23:57:19] <thunder> I didn't set it up that way. it was a prefab image provided by the isp. I haven't had any issue with it til now when trying to add a larger swap file to get around oom reaper killing off some important stuff like freshclam and IDE stuff
