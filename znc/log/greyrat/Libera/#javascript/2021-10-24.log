[00:07:47] <ljharb> spynxic: but it's basically the same thing - return an object, with a method and a value. the method gives you the next object.
[00:07:59] <spynxic> That's a good analogy. What's comparable to generator
[00:08:07] <spynxic> s
[00:08:15] <ljharb> spynxic: nothing really, that's why it's a conceptual primitive.
[00:08:30] <ljharb> "an array" is the thing you'd use before generators. and tbh, after generators too.

[01:41:12] <stenno> actually there is
[01:41:20] <carlino3> i make my own method inside the classes, toJson() that fixes the cirucular references and applies JSON.stringify, but maybe there is a better way to do it

[15:49:17] <src> I need to get data out of an object, and wanted to reverse the binary 'in' operator, so "if NOT ALREADY saved in my list, then push it"

[20:19:03] <zsoc> Assuming you are using a proper toolchain / build env... you can put this in an async function and use await on a promisified set timeout.... OR chain .delay()'s in a promise library that does similar
[20:19:25] <zsoc> node has one of those awaitable setTimeout's as of... some version, tho, built in. v16 i think?
[20:19:30] <ljharb> eqw: JS doesn't have "sleep" as a concept, so i'm wondering what you're actually trying to do
[20:19:38] <zsoc> ^ a better question lol
[20:19:44] <stenno> in node you can just use util.promisify(setTimeout)
[20:20:09] <stenno> in the browser you can sleep with having settimeout resolve a promise
[20:20:24] <ljharb> that's still not sleep

[20:20:39] <ljharb> you can *delay* but that is quite different
[20:20:46] <zsoc> stenno: ah, i was thinking of `const { setTimeout } = require('timers/promises');` tho... was that deprecated? or is it the opposite (a v17 thing?)

[20:22:11] <stenno> in <17
[20:22:23] <ljharb> stenno: what do you mean < 17
[20:22:27] <zsoc> it's been awhile since i was on a website where i couldn't click anything / the browser render loop was completely frozen due to some horrible blocking crap like sync ajax
[20:22:45] <zsoc> they are saying you can util.promisify(setTimeout) and that is... something different. Or the same thing but supported in < 17
[20:22:49] <ljharb> stenno: `require('timers/promises')` and `util.promisify(setTimeout)` both work in node 17
[20:22:59] <ljharb> the latter will never stop working
[20:23:00] <stenno> ljharb: i mean that in 17 you would use timers/promises instead of promisify
[20:23:04] <stenno> not that it doesn't work anymore

[20:31:41] <zsoc> yeah, if this is something like eg: pupeteer, there are build in parameters that take delay or max wait times for checking for something after a trigger, like a click
