[01:46:50] <twainwek> i don't think rpi supports usb3
[01:46:57] <rascul> i don't know what rpi supports
[01:47:10] <puff> nisa: There are almost certainly scads of mailing lists like you want, the problem is that they aren't a generic "Linux" mailing list.  They'll be organized around some other identity, most likely the "distribution" (distro for short). Redhat is a distro, debian is a distro, ubuntu is a distro.
[01:47:11] <rascul> it doesn't have the sata or nvme stuff, does it?
[01:47:13] <NoBugButFeature> raspbian is based on debian but not ubuntu.
[01:47:19] <twainwek> apparently there is an rpi4
[01:47:26] <Shaun> the current ones do, the pi4.  and you really want the 4, since prior models share the network & usb on the same usb-hub, so your bottleneck is doing double-duty
[01:47:32] <MinusOne> raspberry pi 4 does have usb3 I believe. You can get a SATA "hat" for it
[01:47:35] <NoBugButFeature> and if you are really not using hw raid, you can use the usb3 card with a regular card reader
[01:47:38] <Shaun> er, do support usb3, that is
[01:47:38] <twainwek> rascul: doesn't nvme go on pcie
[01:47:40] <NoBugButFeature> but iirc, you may need a kernel-module for that
[01:47:45] <twainwek> rpi got no pcie
[01:47:55] <rascul> twainwek i think it might be a mini-pcie thing or some such? i don't remember well
[01:48:03] <puff> nisa: Which distro are you using?  If it's ubuntu, for example, I'd suggest going over to #ubuntu and asking there for a recommmendation.  Although, in my experience most of the ubuntu-related content has been web based forums, askubuntu, etc.

[03:49:10] <nisa> magicvoodoo: "ungoogled" is a misleading term here
[03:49:34] <magicvoodoo> I don't think so
[03:49:37] <NoBugButFeature> i see, thank you, and how's the ram consumption in palemoon? I'm using it for testing purpose, so i will need to use it for long time
[03:49:42] <nisa> as it turns out it still has lots of bad google stuff
[03:50:03] <linus> It was forked from old Firefox for performance reasons. I have had substantially, much  less freezes and crashes etc. on it

[03:50:12] <NoBugButFeature> and that will give me a feel of whether it's good for me

[05:04:27] <pluri> cool
[05:04:33] <akoana> vibez: which host/guest os and vm software do you use?
[05:04:52] <sheep> disabling it is usually sufficient
[05:05:00] <MinusOne> pluri, it should be. Then you can start it manually with systemctl start <service>, and stop it with systemctl <stop> . If you mask it, you will not be able to do that. So start with disabling.
[05:05:02] <Khaytsus> So it's possibly not even a Linux issue, rather a VM issue
[05:05:07] <rascul> vibez have you tried a different distro in the vm?
[05:05:11] <vibez> guest os is linux mint, host is windows 10 and vm softwaer is virtualbox
[05:05:18] <MinusOne> err systemctl stop <service>
[05:05:26] <pluri> yeah i won't need it in the future, just wanted to make sure it won't occupy my port
[05:05:41] <vibez> yes, ive tried a few. audio had been fine in them if i remember correctly
[05:05:52] <rascul> vibez it's just mint that has the issue?
[05:05:59] <vibez> yup, so far
[05:06:19] <rascul> in such a case i would recommend not using mint for the time being
[05:06:29] <magicvoodoo> sounds like the type of magic that randomly gets fixed 2 years later by some passerby
[05:06:54] <rascul> could be that mint has something older that the other distros have a newer fix for
[05:07:14] <vibez> possibly

[05:07:40] <rascul> tracking it down could be time consuming but if you really wanted to then i would start by comparing kernel versions between working properly distros and the not working properly distro

[05:08:18] <MinusOne> or it could be your pulseaudio configuration. Going the opposite way, windows virtualized on Linux, you sometimes need to manually set windows audio bitrate to match linux. You could try making pulseaudio's bitrate match windows
[05:08:21] <magicvoodoo> could it be that he simply enabled a DSP somewhere

[07:14:12] <MinusOne> as often as I please
[07:14:16] <pnbeast> When you chop them the veins in their wings weep and they dry faster - it makes the frying less consistent.  You really want a batch of consistently sized butterflies.  And, as far as the type, well - presentation is everything.  You want a butterfly that looks good when battered, not a boring one.
[07:14:22] <[[R]]> rustytaco: i saw a video of a dog with a cicada in its mouth
[07:14:48] <rustytaco> they taste like shrimp until they get older - once they've become dark they aren't very edible.

[11:56:09] <p-i-> I noted my box supports a /64 subrange with network IP 2011:19f0:b001:ee3 so I try `curl --interface 2011:19f0:b001:ee3:0:0:0:0  https:

[11:56:54] <p-i-> am I missing something _really_ obvious here?
[11:57:06] <Takios> p-i-: look at "ip a" what ipv6 address is actually assigned to your interface
[11:57:46] <cursey> earlier you said the address was 2101:19f0:b001:ee3:5430:03ff:f19a:8dba

[11:58:34] <p-i-> I thought that as I have a /64 range I could use any IPv6 within that range

[11:59:02] <Tech_8> subnetting is
[11:59:12] <ruc2625> p-i-: the ipv6 stack takes the prefix to create an ipv6 address. the host part (the lower 64 bit) are usually created from the interface's MAC address. or, if you have enabled privacy extensions, from a random number.
[11:59:32] <Takios> p-i-: yes but one machine still has one IP address assigned, not the whole network

[11:59:44] <cursey> one interface has one assigned IP
[12:00:58] <p-i-> So I'd have to create a separate interface for each IP I wish to use?
[12:01:02] <ruc2625> cursey: not necessarily. with ipv6 it is perfectly normal to have more than one address per interface. at least the link local fe80. and the configured one in assigned prefix.

[12:06:08] <ruc2625> p-i-: a fe80 address is automatically assigned by the stack. it can only be used on the same link.
[12:06:10] <NiLon> p-i- it's not that different from ipv4, same idea works
[12:06:20] <p-i-> Takios: Supposing I wish to separate 2 curls simultaneously from different IPs. I guess that means I'd need to create 2 IPv6 interfaces...

[12:09:27] <pluri> aha so additional configuration
[12:09:29] <pluri> that makes sense

[12:11:17] <Takios> if you change a config file that's supplied by a package and the file changes in the package, it'll create a conflict. if the package/software implemented a conf.d dir, this is prevented

[15:48:37] <skirol> hi there, i see ubuntu uses snaps and other distros use flatpak. I also see that it more often happens that snap packages are packaged officially by the company providing the software, for example spotify. Is there any functional difference for an end user whichever format is used?

[20:25:08] <rtn0> im dealing with a problem that you guys are likely to have some help for. here is a short snippet copied from another channel:
[20:25:11] <rustytaco> you really cant. A client can request an address but the server is under no obligation to actually give it THAT address.. hostname or mac are generally used to find the host's proper IP and give it out
