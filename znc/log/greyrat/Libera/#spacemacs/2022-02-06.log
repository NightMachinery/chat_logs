[01:14:22] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> That is a good idea. Although I guess it should check if svg is a supported image 'type'. I think featurep only tests if some feature/package has been loaded.
[01:22:39] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Well it is not working flawlessly yet, and it will probably not be very easy to make it work flawlessly. As long as it has bugs, it is probably better to write it so that continuous scroll is an option/togglable, but it would probably take quite some work to implement it like that (elegantly).
[01:23:26] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> When the quality of the package becomes acceptable then it will probably get merged directly into pdf-tools
[01:24:52] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Haha thanks... yes I thought that too.
[01:26:16] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> But I have announced it on Reddit also... I hope some clever users will look at it and help fix some bugs
[01:47:10] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> Firefox is my go to PDF viewer. But when I need to edit things, I use Evince. Evince has almost no advance features but what shows up in Evince always shows up in all other PDF viewers. I've tried some other more advanced ones like PDF Expert, but some of their editings/annotations won't show up on all platforms.
[01:49:19] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I think Firefox generally uses some plugin as a pdf viewer. Evince uses the poppler library which is the same as pdf-tools uses...
[01:49:29] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> The whole PDF thing is a mess. In 2019 one user showed me a PDF flyer of his local pizza restaurant. And any PDF viewer will crash when you rotate it 90 degree clockwise. (It works well counterclockwise)
[01:50:52] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Haha... well I thought there is some PDF standard (with different versions of course). I guess it is up to the viewers/pdf libraries to implement those standards well...
