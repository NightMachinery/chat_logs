[00:04:39] <octachron> Recent version of MSVC supports C11 but not the needed C11 atomics.
[00:05:14] <octachron> I am not sure if the atomics end up in the C API which would be a potential obstacle.
[00:06:00] <companion_cube> it must support C++ atomics
[00:06:09] <companion_cube> which afaik are the same (and came first)
[00:07:42] <octachron> yes, but you cannot export C++11 atomic types in a C interface.

[00:11:22] <companion_cube> hmm good point
[00:12:05] <companion_cube> it's templates in C++ iirc
[00:14:16] <octachron> But I imagine that part of the reason is also that the multicore didn't want or didn't dare to change the runtime language.
[00:15:29] <companion_cube> yeah
[00:15:34] <companion_cube> windows support was never stellar anyway :p
[00:16:21] <sadiq> windows support will still be there

[06:53:25] <sparogy> it's not my first functional language though, so I'm not struggling too much for concepts at the moment, but I do love how the type system corrects me
[06:56:05] <sparogy> are there any recommendations for ocaml specific features I should try to use? I am used to elixir and lisp for functional stuff, and whatever you call functional JS these days
[06:57:33] <companion_cube> not particularly, just know that |> exists :)
[06:59:40] <rgrinberg> companion_cube I dont think the cmi saves the where the corresponding values/types are in the implementation though.
[06:59:59] <rgrinberg> but the information is bound to be computed as part of compilation
[07:00:32] <companion_cube> well, when you compile the .ml, you can warn for values that are not 1. used in the rest of the .ml  2. not exported in .cmi
[07:01:16] <sparogy> companion_cube: I am familiar with it, but due to currying it works very differently from elixir ^_^

[23:13:34] <d_bot> <quernd> I solved it (not in OCaml though), feel free to share your solution and I'll take a look
[23:14:23] <d_bot> <zakkor> I finally figured it out... I was doing integer division which was rounding down badly
[23:14:46] <d_bot> <Perry> Ah, you had trouble with the "more than half is really (x+1)/2" issue?
[23:14:51] <d_bot> <zakkor> yes
[23:15:02] <d_bot> <Perry> I hit that momentarily.
[23:15:02] <d_bot> <zakkor> haha
[23:15:20] <d_bot> <Perry> I'm also not using OCaml this year, I know it too well. I tend to use AoC to learn new languages.

[23:33:44] <Anarchos> I am still unable to get my local ocaml compiler "dynlink.cmxa" file  to appear in my switch /boot/home/.opam/5.00.0+trunk/lib/ocaml/
[23:34:23] <Anarchos> i tried 'opam pin myocaml' where myocaml is my local source directory for ocaml, and 'opam reinstall ocaml-variants'
