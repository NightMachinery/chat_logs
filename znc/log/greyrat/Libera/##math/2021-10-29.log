[00:43:40] <isekaijin> I would say that it is ambiguous. It is not clear what happens at a rate of 2000 Hz.

[00:44:29] <cherim> Z-module is right. In "2000 Hz = 1/2000 seconds" LHS has dimension [T^{-1}], and RHS has dimension [T]. There is an obvious correspondence, but you can't equate those in the usual sense
[00:44:46] <cherim> Say, multiplying both sides by 2 won't have much meaning
[00:45:00] <isekaijin> To be precisely, 2000 Hz = 1 / ((1/2000) seconds), of course.
[00:45:20] <bildramer> there's 2pi involved in conversions between period / some sort of "one (2pi)th of a period" timescale / frequency / some sort of angular velocity
[00:45:47] <bildramer> it's not very tricky if you focus on what you're doing and why
[00:45:49] <isekaijin> It really depends on what is happening at a rate of 2000 Hz.
[00:46:11] <Decker> pi converts from cycles to radians
[00:46:13] <isekaijin> It could be that your system completes a full cycle at a rate of 2000 Hz.
[00:46:47] <bildramer> and to confuse it a bit more, 2000 Hz = 1 / (2000 seconds), and multiplying _those_ works
[00:46:49] <isekaijin> Or it could be that your system cycles 1 rad at a rate of 2000 Hz.

[06:28:18] <coco> friends I have a math problem that I don't even know how to start
[06:36:36] <coco> I'm trying to prove something but I'm kinda dumb
[06:40:03] <frelleck> this is the dumb channel, you are in luck
[06:41:06] <raskol> start by typing your math words into the box
[06:42:35] <qergle> step 1: cut a hole in the box
[06:44:20] <qeed> make it an axiom
[06:47:43] <coco> Let a,b,m,n be integers and gcd(m,n) = 1. Let cm ≅ (b-a) (mod n).

[06:47:56] <coco> no, that's wrong
[06:48:18] <coco> Let a,b,m,n be integers and gcd(m,n) = 1. Let c ≅ (b-a) * m^-1 (mod n)
[06:48:53] <coco> Prove that x = a + cm is a solution to x ≅ a (mod m) and x ≅ b (mod n)
[06:49:05] <coco> So, here's what I tried.
[06:49:15] *** Joins: soapsudsxx (~soapsudsx@209.221.40.155)
[06:50:05] <qergle> ok show us what you've done
[06:50:20] <coco> gcd(m,n) = 1 so m has an inverse mod n. cm ≅ (b-a) (mod n) => n | (b-a) - cm => (b-a) - cm = nk, for some k \in Z
[06:51:12] <coco> Now, plugging the proposed solution into x ≅ a (mod m) gives us a + cm ≅ a (mod m)
[06:51:39] <coco> and so m | a - a + cm => m | cm (and this is true for any c \in Z)
[06:51:45] <qergle> maybe you're plugging in too late
[06:52:17] <PlanckWalk> Really you want the other way around
[06:52:35] <qergle> take the first congruence you're checking, x ≡ a (mod m)
[06:53:02] <qergle> what happens if you plug in your x (i.e. a+cm) in for x?
[06:53:17] <coco> Plugging the proposed soltuion into the other congruence, x ≅ b (mod n) => a + cm ≅ b (mod n) => n| b-(a+cm) => n| (b-a) - cm
[06:53:26] <PlanckWalk> m|(cm) therefore m|(a+cm-a) which means a+cm = a (mod m)
[06:53:28] <coco> and that is n| nk (which is true for any k \in Z)
[06:53:33] <cherim> If cm = (b-a) (mod n), then a+cm = [a + (b-a)] (mod n) = b (mod n)
[06:53:42] <coco> Does that prove it?
[06:53:51] <qergle> coco: i think you should plug in earlier
[06:54:25] <qergle> plug in x directly into x ≡ a (mod m) and then plug in cm to x ≡ b (mod n)
[06:54:44] <PlanckWalk> coco: You've shown a backward series of implication, whereas you need a forward one.  *In this case* they go both ways, but in general you need to be more careful about direction.
[06:55:04] <qergle> ie in first case "a+cm" and in 2nd case "a+stuff" where stuff is what cm equals
[06:55:07] <coco> @PlanckWalk, but we're at least in the same realm of reality which is promising
[06:55:12] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[06:56:01] <coco> You start with a statement that is clearly true and build up the congruence, which does seem more rigorous somehow

[06:57:17] <cherim> You seem to already go from "cm = (b-a) (mod n) =>...", but then "a+cm = [a + (b-a)] (mod n) = b (mod n)" is as good a finish
[06:57:27] <coco> qergle, so I agree plugging x into x ≅ a (mod m) works, but what do you mean plug cm into the second congruence>
[06:57:35] <coco> shouldn't I also plugin x?
[06:58:03] <qergle> you have c ≡ (b-a) * m^-1 (mod n)
[06:58:31] <qergle> so cm ≡ (b-a) * m^-1 * m (mod n) ≡ (b-a) (mod n)
[06:58:45] <coco> right, and I know m has an inverse so I can write cm ≅ (b-a) (mod n)
[06:58:56] <PlanckWalk> If you've been doing a bit of work with congruences, you might have some theorems like  a=b (mod b)  implies  ax=bx (mod c)  for all integer x, that sort of thing.

[06:59:22] <PlanckWalk> And transitivity, symmetry, reflexivity of ≅ and so on
[06:59:30] <qergle> yes, so now you can write x \ equiv a+cm (mod n) as x ≡ a+(b-a) (mod n)
[07:00:08] <qergle> because cm ≡ (b-a) (mod n)
[07:00:23] <frelleck> how can anyone find this problem hard

[09:55:45] <r9> Hi, I have questions about spring problem. Given y′′(t) + by′(t) + ky(t) = −G, where b, k, G are positive and G is gravity constant, what is the limit of y(t) as t approaches ∞? If the equation is y′′(t) + by′(t) + ky(t) = 0, then I guess the limit is 0, but I'm not sure if having -G changes the limit.

[09:57:45] <qergle> spring no matter
[10:00:18] <somiaj> You could turn it into a system and look for an equilibirum solution
[10:00:59] <somiaj> let x_1 = y, x_2 = y', then you have x_1' = y' = x_2, and x_2' = y'' = -k x_1 - b x_2 - G

[10:01:20] <qergle> but yes, limit should be different, no?
[10:01:50] <somiaj> if x_1' = x_2 = 0 and x_2' = -k x_1 - G = 0, you get x_1 = -G/k, which I think you can argue is asymptoically stable, an thus the limit
[10:02:15] *** Quits: ExeciN (~ExeciN@user/nicexe) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[10:02:56] <somiaj> Though to me that constant should be +G (not -G), and the limit is G/k, which would make sense, but I am use to these problems that the positive direction of y is downward, if the positive direction is upward, the -G/k makes sense.
[10:03:00] <qergle> our solution will be something like y(t)=(something that goes to 0)+(something else that goes to 0)+(G/k)
[10:03:37] <somiaj> well -(G/k) the way they have it setup, and sure you could also solve the DE, but the phase plane gives the limits nicely too
[10:04:11] <qergle> right -(G/k)
[10:04:34] <qergle> so assuming G=9.86 or whatever, the limit should be -9.86/k

[10:06:43] <r9> Why does k come into play but not b?
[10:07:02] <qergle> because gravity acts on mass?
[10:07:12] <somiaj> r9: because at the equilibirum solution, the velocity will be approximatly zero, and thus the damping will have no effect
[10:07:55] <r9> ah okok

[10:08:53] <qergle> is that what the b-parameter is called, damping constant?

[14:05:45] <loller_> here it is https://www.uni-muenster.de/Physik.TP/~munsteg/arnold.html
[14:06:15] <loller_> ENS students who have sat through courses on differential and algebraic geometry (read by respected mathematicians) turned out be acquainted neither with the Riemann surface of an elliptic curve y2 = x3 + ax + b nor, in fact, with the topological classification of surfaces (not even mentioning elliptic integrals of first kind and the group property of an elliptic curve, that is, the Euler-Abel addition theorem). They were only
[14:06:15] <loller_> taught Hodge structures and Jacobi varieties!
[14:06:24] <loller_> this is a perfect example of what I mean
[14:06:33] <loller_> "they were only taught Hodge structures and Jacobi varieties"
[14:06:43] <isekaijin> I do not understand the Bourbaki hate. It is certainly not exciting and not going to bring any new people to math. But it works just fine for some people who are already interested in it.
[14:06:45] <loller_> that describes my analysis professor perfectly
[14:07:12] <loller_> isekaijin: the problem is it has taken over how math is taught in the West

[14:11:47] <isekaijin> I think the real criticisms are that (a) not enough emphasis is made on the geometric intuition behind the technical tools, (b) the drive to generalize has been pushing math too much towards the algebraic side of things, forgetting that many interesting and useful things only happen over R and C.
[14:12:55] <Cale> My objection to Bourbaki's style is mostly their reluctance to draw any pictures, but I also probably would have had the same disagreement that Grothendieck did when it comes to category theory or foundations generally. (Though I also have the benefit of having been exposed to things like Martin-Löf type theory which did not exist at the time.)

[14:24:38] <Cale> 1-cells represent our approximations to just intervals available in the tuning system, while 2-cells represent the commas being tempered in order to make additional equations hold of the approximations
[14:25:41] <Cale> Or to be more precise, there's a particular module homomorphism from a finite rank submodule of the rationals generated by the first few primes, to the integers (our abstract "keyboard"), and the 2-cells are elements of the kernel of that homomorphism

[14:33:00] <Cale> Like, if you were to stack two justly tuned (9/8) intervals, you'd get (9/8)^2, and that exceeds 5/4 by 81/80 (known as the syntonic comma). By putting 81/80 in the kernel of the map, we get the property that two whole tones make a major third. By some comparable reasoning, we have that three whole tones are an approximation to 7/5, and putting 5/4 and 7/5 together gets you 7/4, the octave equivalent of the seventh
[14:33:00] <Cale> harmonic. The usual 12 equal divisions of the octave does really poorly with multiples of 7.

[15:00:05] <riv> interesting! it sounds good
[15:01:52] <Cale> Gbb is obviously way out of key, but being (a reasonable approximation to) the 11th harmonic of C makes it feel justified, and then the notes following it are weirder relative to the C in the bass, but justified by being a nice ratio from what came before, and being in a straight line, and it all resolves back :)

[17:01:16] <JimmyRustles> thanks
[17:02:26] <isekaijin> savask: No, I think that ideal is too large. For example, if p is the ideal of an arbitrary hypersurface, then it most likely projects onto the whole of A^n, or at least a dense subset of it. So we should obtain the zero ideal.
[17:02:29] <Z-module> yes, radicand = the thing whose (square) root is being taken
[17:03:16] <[itchyjunk]> didn't know that had a word
[17:03:31] <Cale> savask: I was thinking you could use that degree-reducing operation you mentioned before, repeatedly, until y is eliminated, and that gets you some polynomial in x_1,...,x_n

[17:05:13] <[itchyjunk]> probably easy for you anyways
[17:05:16] <savask> Cale: Well, that was the idea. Say, if polynomial cy + d is in p and our new (larger) ideal is q, then c(y+a)+d - (cy+d) = ca is in q, so c is. Since q is an ideal, cy is there also, and so d lies there. It seems that it works for higher degrees as well (if char k = 0), and that way you can put all coefficients inside of q
[17:06:22] <isekaijin> [itchyjunk]: I could only wish they were easy. The only way to do things that are difficult is to start doing them. Waiting until they become easy means waiting forever.

[20:29:33] <azonenberg> So I'm trying to wrap my head around least squares fits
[20:30:19] <azonenberg> I have a dataset consisting of two noisy sinewaves of approximately known, equal frequency
[20:30:24] <azonenberg> but different amplitude and phase
[20:30:54] <azonenberg> My goal is to determine the amplitude and phase of the second sinewave with respect to the first
[20:31:18] <azonenberg> My initial idea was to take a fourier transform of both then find the highest bin in the output and compute the ratio of amplitudes / different in phases
[20:31:29] <azonenberg> Which worked but is giving very noisy phase data for some reason
[20:31:57] <azonenberg> also it seems inefficient because I only care about one frequency
[20:32:50] <azonenberg> So my thought is, if I could fit a pure sine (amplitude, starting phase, frequency to each waveform I could probably get more robust results in the presence of noise
[20:33:29] <Koen> amplitude shouldn't be too hard to fit
[20:33:32] <azonenberg> The system is extremely overdetermined, the datasets contain a huge number of samples - anywhere from a few hundred thousand to tens of millions of points, sampled significantly faster than Nyquist
[20:33:34] <Koen> it's basically max-min
[20:33:38] <azonenberg> amplitude is easy, phase is the hard part
[20:33:51] <azonenberg> I have a good starting guess of frequency since I generated the input waveform
[20:34:01] <azonenberg> but the local oscillators of the generator and detector are not necessarily coherent
[20:34:06] <azonenberg> so there is likely a small amount of drift
[20:34:21] <azonenberg> probably in the <10 ppm range

[20:35:36] <azonenberg> Context: I'm trying to measure the vector response of a circuit in the forward direction
[20:35:46] <azonenberg> So I take a sinewave generator and feed it through a splitter
[20:35:49] <Koen> phase shouldn't be too hard either; it doesn't matter that it's actually a sine, only that it's periodic. for instance, keep only the points at the top of each wave and discard all the rest; that's enough to find the phase

[20:38:36] <azonenberg> Depends on the input frequency. At low freq not as many but at higher freq... let's say 20M points at 2.5 samples per cycle so... about 8 million cycles
[20:39:03] <azonenberg> that's for 16 GHz input, but input could go down to a few MHz in which case i might only have a few cycles - that's easy mode though because a huge time error is a tiny phase error
[20:39:14] <azonenberg> you can just interpolate zero crossings and find relative differences or something
[20:39:25] <azonenberg> But yeah, on the high speed is where it gets trickier
[20:39:37] <azonenberg> I'm sampling faster than Nyquist, but not by a lot
[20:40:22] <azonenberg> So the question is how to find the phase of such a signal accurately

[20:45:30] <W> azonenberg, how approximate is your knowledge of the frequencies? Can you just do a Slow Fourier Transform for the one (or two) frequencies?
[20:45:44] <W> i.e. just do the full sum over the data
[20:46:11] <azonenberg> w: I know what I told the generator to output
[20:46:21] <W> something I've been playing with for a similar problem is to average the change in phase per unit time to hone in on the frequency I want
[20:46:48] <azonenberg> So basically it's down to the drift between the local oscillator on the scope and the generator
[20:46:51] <W> i.e. do a good guess for the frequency, if it's close the phase over time will rotate "towards" the correct frequency
[20:47:16] <azonenberg> I can also get a good guess of the corrected frequency by counting zero crossings in the waveform
[20:47:19] <azonenberg> and dividing by record length
[20:48:01] <azonenberg> Once i know frequency and phase, i can get relative amplitude easily by convolving each waveform with a unit-amplitude sine fit to it
[20:48:09] <azonenberg> and dividing one by the other
[20:48:33] <azonenberg> and frequency can be got very close by counting zero crossings like i said
[20:48:55] <azonenberg> So really it's a question of how to find the phase accurately given the relatively undersampled data
[20:49:48] <azonenberg> https://www.antikernel.net/temp/12ghz.png
[20:50:08] <W> over such a large data set, a simple sum should be good, I would think
[20:50:15] <azonenberg> here's an example of some real data. this is zoomed way in, the actual dataset is 80,000 points
[20:50:22] <azonenberg> and that's relatively small, i can go out to tens of millions easily

[20:51:17] <azonenberg> You can see in the FFT output that there are some subharmonics and noise present as well
[20:51:43] <azonenberg> this particular 12 GHz tone was generated by a frequency doubler from a 6 GHz input and some of the 6 GHz leaks through. so basically this means even and odd numbered cycles of the sine have slightly different amplitude

[21:00:56] <W> i.e. sum(x_n*e^(n*w*i*2*pi))/N where w is the frequency in samples^-1 and the samples are x_n for n in [0,N-1]; and perhaps do this in chunks (e.g. split the data in four) and see that the phase comes out the sameish for each; if it's not, your frequency isn't accurate enough (or there is just too much noise, unlikely from the screenshot you showed), and if the phase is linear(ish) with chunk number, you have data to guess a new more accurate frequency

[21:06:10] <azonenberg> a couple seconds per waveform is OK, minutes to hours is not
[21:06:35] <azonenberg> I can do less data if needed, my thought was that more points would let me get more accurate fits in the presence of noise

[21:15:36] <azonenberg> There's not phase drift AFAIK
[21:15:41] <azonenberg> shouldnt be within the waveform
[21:16:02] <azonenberg> there is however likely to be a (mostly constant) frequency shift from the generator to the receiver
[21:16:15] <azonenberg> i.e. i tell the generator to output 6.000 GHz and I actually get 6.00001 GHz
[21:16:22] <azonenberg> relative to the timebase of the oscilloscope
[21:16:31] <azonenberg> since they're not coherent oscillators
[21:17:00] <azonenberg> So while I know the nominal frequency of the input signal, calibration errors on both the scope and generator mean the scope will not see exactly the frequency I told the generator to produce
[21:17:12] <azonenberg> so i do need to do some fitting to recover the exact frequency WRT the sample clock
[21:17:20] <bildramer> is "multiply pure sine and signal" cheap enough that you can do it 20ish times?
[21:18:40] <azonenberg> Yeah it should be. I can AVX512 it or push to the GPU if it's too slow

[23:09:44] <isekaijin> I mean, what you need to add is cbrt(2) and sqrt(-3) to split the first factor, and sqrt(5) to split the second.
[23:09:53] <isekaijin> They look as independent as it gets.
[23:10:41] <isekaijin> Oh, right, I had just proved in the previous exercise that, if you have two nonsquares x, y \in K whose product is also a nonsquare, then K(sqrt(x), sqrt(y)) / K has order 4. Assuming char(K) \ne 2, that is.
[23:11:34] <isekaijin> I never really learnt that semidirect product thing. My knowledge of group theory is nonexistent.
[23:11:54] <riv> yeah and cbrt 2 is indepedent because 2,3 are coprime
[23:12:20] <isekaijin> Yeah.
[23:12:50] <isekaijin> But the extensions adding cbrt(2) and sqrt(-3) are not independent, actually.
[23:13:08] <isekaijin> The Galois group of adding both is S_3, not C_2 x C-3.

[23:13:55] <riv> oh yeah so why does this not apply to sqrt(5)
[23:15:08] <isekaijin> What I meant is that adding sqrt(5) is independent from cbrt(2) in that it does not help you finish splitting any “half-split” polynomials that you got after adding cbrt(2).
[23:15:32] <isekaijin> Whereas adding sqrt(-3) lets you finish splitting X^3 - 2.
[23:16:50] <isekaijin> So the action that switches the sqrt(-3)s interacts with the action that rotates the cbrt(2)s.
