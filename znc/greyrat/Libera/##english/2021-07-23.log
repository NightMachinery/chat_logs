[07:55:16] <sam_wong> Hi, I am a student. The exercise I am doing now is taken from the Unit 40 of GRAMMAR IN USE by RAYMOND MURPHY. The question is "You didn't have breakfast - that's why you're hungry now." The official answer is "If you had had (past perfect) breakfast, you wouldn't be hungry now." My answer is "If you had (simple past) breakfast, you wouldn't be hungry now." Can anyone tell me what the differences between the two answers are? Is my answer 
[07:55:17] <sam_wong> acceptable too? 
[07:55:40] <sam_wong> Thanks a lot.
[08:00:44] <Nimue> I'm not sure, I'm not a native speaker, sorry. I haven't studied that in a long time. I did find a link from Cambridge's online page but I'm not sure it will be very helpful to your exercise but it does clear things a bit more, at least to me. 
[08:01:11] <Nimue> Stay around because there is always a native speaker who can show up and provide proper help :)

[08:15:32] <pussipupu> The answer in your book is in the conditional mood, it's not quite about tense
[08:15:49] <pussipupu> OH, which nimue's answer probably covers, sorry :þ
[08:16:12] <sam_wong> The website suggested by Nimue quotes three types of conditional sentences. However, none of them match the official answer given by RAYMOND MURPHY. Any comment is appreciated.
[08:16:26] * CuriosTiger wanders in.
[08:17:11] <pussipupu> Hmm, actually I'm not quite right, but then English doesn't have a properly distinct conditional mood
[08:17:36] <pussipupu> But “had had” puts the breakfast having before the /hypothetical/ hunger or lack of in the second half of the sentence
[08:17:49] <pussipupu> “had” puts it before the “now” (where you are hungry)
[08:19:23] <CuriosTiger> I would argue "had had" is correct there.
[08:19:39] <sam_wong> That is to say my answer is wrong
[08:20:59] <sam_wong> But my answer match the grammatical structure of type two conditional sentence
[08:20:59] <CuriosTiger> If you substitute in another verb, it may be easier to see why. "If you had eaten breakfast, you would not be hungry now". It's not simply a matter of tense, but of mood, as pussipupu pointed out. This is a conditional perfect.
[08:22:05] <sam_wong> Perhaps you are right, it is the question of mood
[08:22:18] <CuriosTiger> This page offers a bit better of an explanation. Read the explanation for the third conditional: https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/conditionals.html
[08:23:11] <CuriosTiger> https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/third-conditional.html
[08:23:29] <CuriosTiger> "It talks about the past. It's used to describe a situation that didn't happen, and to imagine the result of this situation."

[08:28:56] <sam_wong> The official answer given by RAYMOND does not match the grammatical structure of the second part of the 3rd conditional sentence - would have + past participle. This makes me confuse
[08:29:26] <CuriosTiger> What was the official answer?
[08:30:01] <sam_wong> If you had had breakfast, you wouldn't be hungry now
[08:31:18] <CuriosTiger> Turn it around. You wouldn't be hungry now if you had had breakfast.
[08:31:34] <CuriosTiger> That pattern matches the sample sentence given: "She wouldn't have been tired if she had gone to bed earlier"
[08:32:03] <CuriosTiger> Well, almost matches. "wouldn't have been" vs "wouldn't be". Those two are not the same tense.

[08:32:45] <CuriosTiger> Either way is valid in English. Sentence structure is still somewhat flexible.
[08:34:28] <CuriosTiger> I have to admit that I haven't thoroughly studied the grammar behind conditionals -- I generally do them by intuition -- but Wikipedia discusses a concept of "mixed conditionals": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_conditional_sentences#Mixed_conditional
[08:34:55] <CuriosTiger> and that looks like what is going on in Raymond's sentence.

[16:29:54] <tinwhiskers> I'm not entirely sure but I thin it means that unless you keep an eye on people they won't do what they are meant to do.
[16:30:02] <StayHungry> l’esprit et la lettre... how do you say it in English, let me think
[16:30:13] <StayHungry> arash: give me a minute
[16:30:53] <StayHungry> arash: you know the phrase 'the letter and the spirit of the law'?
[16:33:01] <arash> StayHungry, no, i didn't hear it before
[16:33:12] <StayHungry> spirit is 'don't commit a crime', letter is 'crime is a)...b)...c)...'. and if crime is not listed there, some people believe it's not a crime, forgetting (sometimes intentionally) that not everything can be foreseen.

[16:35:34] <StayHungry> another point of view then, not a legal one, but more earthy. you're a boss of bakery. you tell employees 'bake a good bread every morning'. some of them just go and do that. some of them bake mediocre bread and then argue that you were not specific about 'good bread' definition.

[16:38:49] <StayHungry> basically, some people tend to do only what's prescribed (so it can be measured, inspected). but you obviously expect more, because life is more complex so not everything can be prescribed.

[21:35:34] <cousteau_> I wouldn't be surprised if I have something like that.  My health sucks. 
[21:35:48] <TimMc> My suspicion is that the immune response to both the vaccine and the virus causes this, but that it's worse with the virus.
[21:36:11] <TimMc> It should resolve on its own in some weeks, I think.

[21:36:24] <cousteau_> At least now I'm starting to get old enough to say that it's just an age thing, but it's been like that all my life :) 
[21:36:30] <TimMc> hah
[21:37:12] <cousteau_> Well that would make sense.  Many (if not most) symptoms of a disease are actually caused by the immune system, as far as I know 
[21:37:19] <huf> my health was always too good so it's gonna be a pretty sudden faceplant for me
[21:37:35] <TimMc> huf: Start practicing now: "Oh, my aching knees..."
[21:37:40] <huf> also I acquired lots of unhealthy habits
[21:37:53] <huf> TimMc: well, my back is already going :)
[21:37:55] <cousteau_> Fever, for instance. And coughing is maybe like a side effect of a side effect. 
[21:38:29] <TimMc> Coughing is sort of a side effect, but not a misplaced one -- you do need to clear your lungs.
[21:38:48] <TimMc> although I think some pathogens may stimulate unnecessary coughing because that spreads them better...
[21:38:51] <cousteau_> So it makes sense that a vaccine causes fever.  Immune system is like "wtf is this?? Kill it with fire!" 
[21:38:55] <TimMc> yeah!
[21:39:09] <TimMc> But you shouldn't get coughing from the vaccine. :-)
[21:39:11] <huf> why exactly do your lungs fill with mucus when you're sick?
[21:39:28] <huf> is your body excreting dead infected cell material through your *lungs*?!
[21:39:44] <TimMc> I'm really hazy on that.
[21:39:45] <cousteau_> Dunno, that's the intermediate side effect I was talking about.  I guess mucus protects the
[21:39:51] <huf> yeah me too
[21:39:56] <cousteau_> Thing on the inside of the nose 
[21:40:01] <huf> it might be something the illness does deliberately like you said
[21:40:08] <huf> or just some stupid overreaction 
[21:40:10] <huf> like an allergy
[21:40:13] <TimMc> There's going to be a large infiltration of immune cells into the lung tissue for sure.
[21:40:18] <huf> oh yeah
[21:40:37] <TimMc> But it might just be an inflammation response -- more fluid.
[21:40:57] <huf> body only has one "oh no!" switch and it keeps pressing it :D
[21:41:01] <TimMc> which miiiight be related to more porous vessel boundaries?
[21:41:12] <TimMc> I'm just wild-ass-guessing here.
[21:41:33] <huf> oh you're sick? let me turn on all the taps
[21:41:37] <twb> huf: I thought phlegm you cough up when you're sick is bad juju
[21:41:43] <huf> so you leak from every fucking orifice you have and some you dont
[21:41:51] <huf> twb: better out than in
[21:41:58] <TimMc> I think one thing that's going to happen is we're going to learn a lot about viruses *in general* from all this.
[21:42:01] <huf> now if it's blood, you better get your ass to the hospital 
[21:42:21] <twb> well that's just TB innnit
[21:43:06] <TimMc> I have a running hypothesis that a lot of the stuff SARS-CoV-2 does isn't unusual at all, it's just that it's 1) all happening at once, and 2) happening for the first time in more people's lives when they're older and more susceptible to it.
[21:43:24] <TimMc> Normally you'd get all the coronaviruses as a kid.

[22:15:12] <kurahaupo> Covid survival is 99.7% only if you have access to hospital care. If more than 0.1% of the population is sick with Covid at the same time, that prerequisite cannot be guaranteed. That's why we have lock downs even while the death rate it tiny. If the infection rate gets badly out of hand, the survival rate can fall to around 95%
[22:15:39] <kurahaupo> Or just get immunized…

[23:34:59] <bin> "Call me on my cell:"

[23:38:20] <LuisP14> someone or other might, but mostly bill
[23:38:48] <bin> sure, I just personally never hear it. I hear it in BrE all the time, so it wouldn't really phase me
