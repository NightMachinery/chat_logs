[20:04:22] <rob0> Fohsap: if your apps have you logged in, they know who you are, and would have similar means to know where you are.  Use completely "clean" software to make yourself unknown.
[20:06:35] <Fohsap> Well, you know there are companies like ExpressVPN that boast their ability to somehow obscure this.
[20:06:54] <Fohsap> I had some creative ideas, but I kind of feel like I'm throwing paint at a wall.

[20:12:33] <rob0> do they have a free trial?
[20:13:27] <rob0> I bet their help desk is often explaining this to their victim^Wcustomers
[20:14:48] <rob0> maybe they run everything through a proxy?  But there too, you can't really proxy HTTPS without a successful MITM attack

[20:49:27] <Fohsap> uhm, i used their service for a few years.
[20:49:30] <Fohsap> it had a lot of outages
[20:49:53] <Fohsap> but the price wasn't very bad for what i was getting.  like 5 bucks a month for a vpn after discounts....
[20:50:07] <Fohsap> they claim you can watch netflix on it
[20:50:49] <Fohsap> i'm sure they'd give free trials, but I couldn't see myself asking for one because I wouldn't know how to figure out whwat they were doing on the back-end, anyway.

[21:37:53] <DArqueBishop> You are, of course, depending on the VPN provider to not keep logs tracking where you're connecting from.
[21:38:22] <DArqueBishop> This is not always a safe bet, even when they claim they don't.
