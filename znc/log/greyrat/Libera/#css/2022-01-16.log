[00:30:41] <shantaram> hassoon: that's a lot nicer than the way i ended up doing it
[00:32:11] <matsaman> would actually be good to apply via JS, too
[00:32:36] <matsaman> wasn't there a way to have chaings colors for text now, too?
[00:32:45] <matsaman> which means you could theoretically use a custom font
[00:32:57] <hassoon> matsaman: js ? you mean a dedicated canvas ? svg ?
[00:33:23] <hassoon> shantaram: yep, pseudo-elements are your friends
[00:33:27] <matsaman> no, just applying a class and the 'content' value
[00:33:45] <matsaman> so you wouldn't have to re-type the text
[00:33:50] <matsaman> could do server-side too of course
[00:34:41] <hassoon> shantaram: you can make the text of the pseudo-element programmable using custom html attributes and by calling attr('attr_name')
[00:34:43] <shantaram> you could put the content value in a css variable
[00:34:53] <shantaram> hassoon: ooh that'd work too
[00:35:15] <shantaram> i was gonna suggest setting the content value via a css custom prop in an inline style
[00:35:20] <entropy_> how do i set a css value to all <input type="text" /> ?
[00:35:28] <shantaram> input[type=text]
[00:35:32] <hassoon> shantaram: ya if your text is dynamically generated from e.g a backend env, you can pass the text to a custom html attrribute too
[00:35:34] <entropy_> cool thanks
[00:35:38] <hassoon> and css will take care of the rest
[00:36:17] <hassoon> matsaman: i don't get it
[00:36:26] <hassoon> the applying a class on the content value
[00:36:27] <hassoon> thing
[00:36:45] <matsaman> using your approach, but
[00:37:04] <matsaman> setting thing 'content' value dynamically, rather than typing out twice
[00:37:16] *** Joins: dpuerto (~dpuerto@136-27-83-52.cab.webpass.net)
[00:37:21] <matsaman> setting the* sheesh
[00:38:34] <hassoon> matsaman: ah instructing js to mutate the content css property is not needed in this case, but sure, that's doable if they want to do that
[00:39:37] <matsaman> definitely
[00:39:46] <matsaman> just yammerin'
[00:40:45] <hassoon> ahah
[00:46:01] <shantaram> hey hassoon how do you publish new ones of these
[00:55:39] <hassoon> shantaram: the share button
[00:55:47] <shantaram> no but how does it work
[00:55:52] <shantaram> is there a backend somewhere
[00:56:01] <hassoon> shantaram: yep, it uses gist
[00:56:45] *** Quits: dpuerto (~dpuerto@136-27-83-52.cab.webpass.net) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[00:57:04] <shantaram> oh
[00:57:17] <hassoon> it used to have a php/mysql backend before, but i did not want to pay for a vps , so i migrated to gist
[00:57:30] <hassoon> *for a new vps *
[00:57:39] <shantaram> nice
[00:57:41] <hassoon> it's even faster with gist
[00:57:58] <hassoon> the run as well is signifacntly faster
[00:58:19] <hassoon> it just sends the code to a cross-domain iframe
[00:58:30] <hassoon> * significantly *
[00:58:49] <hassoon> thanks
[00:59:18] <shantaram> really cool stuff
[00:59:37] <hassoon> ya i like it :)

[11:14:33] <FunkyBob> Rockwood: what's wrong with using viewport units?
[11:14:50] <Rockwood> nothing
[11:14:56] <FunkyBob> why do you want to detec the screen size?
[11:14:58] <FunkyBob> to what end?
[11:15:10] <Rockwood> actually for my modal sizing
[11:15:33] <Rockwood> my form out of modal in small screen
[11:15:45] <Rockwood> my modal is in flex
[11:16:00] <Rockwood> i think media query needs there too
[11:17:12] <FunkyBob> ok, but why do you think that?
[11:17:17] <FunkyBob> what do you want to use the scree size _for_?
[11:17:22] <FunkyBob> or do we have to guess that?
[11:19:43] <Rockwood> https://gist.github.com/Cyberiaaxis/cfdeb6f76fd6f5b05eac549d3e18bcca
[11:20:11] <Rockwood> actually i was guessing that for make it correct i am not sure how can i make it responsive
[11:20:59] <Rockwood> it was a totally assumption abt screen size auto dictation
[11:21:13] <Rockwood> it was a totally assumption abt screen size auto sense
[11:21:31] <Rockwood> hope now you are understand my point
[11:21:58] <FunkyBob> "I want to make my modal responsive" is a little vauge, you see
[11:22:15] <FunkyBob> in what way do you want it to respond?
[11:23:14] <Rockwood> means
[11:23:30] <Rockwood> simply my concern is responsive modal
[11:23:48] <Rockwood> even its content should be appropriate
[11:24:21] <FunkyBob> you want the contents to rearrange depending on the available space?
[11:24:27] <FunkyBob> you want some things to disappear?
[11:25:12] <Rockwood> [13:25:01] <FunkyBob> you want the contents to rearrange depending on the available space? yes i wanna this
[11:25:28] <FunkyBob> ah
[11:25:34] <FunkyBob> see, I  thought you wanted it to change size
[11:25:36] <FunkyBob> but you never said
[11:26:06] <FunkyBob> yes, typically a media query is used for this

[22:29:26] <fakuve> Hey guys , just a quickone . I'm trying to insert sort of a background layout behind my grid layout . So for that I got two Rows with 8 knobs (thats how it looks like at the beginning)
[22:30:04] <fakuve> How can I insert a column behind row-1 , so I can insert numbers to the current knobs (with opacity of the first layer low)
