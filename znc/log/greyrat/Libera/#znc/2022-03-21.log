[02:03:30] <wwalker> I'm having similar problem to Hawker .  When I connect to znc, it immediately kicks me back off, I th8ink it is because znc cant' connect to libera.  libera complains about sasl, but I can't get connected to znc for more than 1 econd, so I can't run any /*sasl commands.  What am I missing?  is there any documentationon how to configure sasl at the file level?
[02:04:33] <wwalker> * am trying to connect to libera on 6697 with tls
[02:05:06] <MetaNova> my immediate suspicion is that you are specifying the wrong PASS or other connection information required for your client to connect to ZNC properly
[02:05:22] <MetaNova> even if ZNC has no networks configured, it will not kick you off for that.
[02:05:29] <MetaNova> wwalker: what client?
[02:06:19] <wwalker> MetaNova: irssi
[02:06:34] <MetaNova> please reference [[Irssi]]

[02:07:35] <wwalker> MetaNova: Thank you!
[02:07:42] <MetaNova> this requires knowledge of the IP/host address of the ZNC instance, what port it is listening on, if the port is SSL-enabled or not, your ZNC username (which you specified), the name of the network you configured, and the password (which you specified)
[02:08:19] <MetaNova> oh. look. freenode examples.

[02:12:40] <wwalker> MetaNova: Thank you!  I know that keeping up the docs is never the fun part.
[02:15:40] <MetaNova> it can be fun at times
[02:15:47] <MetaNova> like when you're creating your first page
[02:15:52] <MetaNova> mine was [[Ignore]]
[02:15:52] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Ignore
[02:16:59] <MetaNova> I had no idea what I was doing so I cannibalized a lot of the structure from other pages
[02:27:23] <Hawker> So with my client I'm using a server pass right?
[02:29:13] <Khaytsus> You mixing up znc<->irc with client<->znc ?
[02:29:23] <Khaytsus> The first may require a cert, but client to znc would not no
[02:29:35] <Khaytsus> And make sure you're specifying your connection string right, [[]]
[02:29:35] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/
[02:29:44] <Khaytsus> You can set username as username@clientid/network to connect to a specific network
[02:30:02] <MetaNova> Hawker: there are two passwords and three certificates
[02:30:03] <Khaytsus> If you don't, you'll just keep connecting to the first server
[02:30:26] <Hawker> MetaNova, I don't follow
[02:30:33] <MetaNova> one password for *sasl or *nickserv or *perform, one password for your client -> znc
[02:31:11] <Hawker> I am pretty sure the issue is that my client doesn't connect to the bouncer
[02:31:19] <Hawker> but idk why
[02:31:33] <Hawker> It just seems to refuse SASL connection
[02:31:41] <MetaNova> then there's the certificate ZNC uses to listen on a port with SSL, then the optional certificate via *cert you can make ZNC supply to the network, and then also optionally a cert via *certauth to allow your client -> znc
[02:31:55] <MetaNova> Hawker: what is the EXACT error you are seeing?

[02:37:02] <Hawker> is it the same as logging into web ui?

[02:37:16] <MetaNova> Hawker: yes
[02:37:29] <Hawker> k I know that

[02:39:45] <Hawker> MetaNova, mine?
[02:39:53] <MetaNova> wwalker
[02:40:14] <MetaNova> wwalker: because that's as easy as: 1) /msg *status loadmod sasl 2) /msg *sasl set username password
[02:40:38] <MetaNova> the username being your registered NickServ accountname ("wwalker") and the NickServ password associated with it
[02:40:53] <MetaNova> (SASL auth takes the same credentials as "/msg nickserv identify user password")
[02:43:07] <Hawker> MetaNova, can I just use the same config I have that works with Libera? for connecting to the bouncer?
[02:43:35] <MetaNova> Hawker: you remember the username and password that you use to log into webadmin, right?
[02:44:36] <Hawker> MetaNova, yes, I know it, and I can log in
[02:44:40] <Hawker> via web ui
[02:45:00] <MetaNova> then you have all the credentials you need to make your client actually connect to ZNC
[02:45:15] <MetaNova> and don't need to touch the config
