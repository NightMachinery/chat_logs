[06:19:06] <mparillo> What does it do? I would have guessed that when I start qutebrowser, it would not load the contents of the tabs until I actually open them, but watching my memory, it seems as if they all get loaded at once.
[06:19:21] <MacGyver> It used to, and then it broke.
[06:19:45] <MacGyver> I'm not sure it got fixed.
[06:20:30] <MacGyver> Iirc it didn't work beyond *some* certain Qt version.
[06:29:58] <mparillo> TY and good night.
[06:33:43] <MacGyver> https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/4881 was the initial breakage, that got fixed, and then Qt 5.15 happened.
[06:34:05] <MacGyver> https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/5359 is the issue for that one, I think.
