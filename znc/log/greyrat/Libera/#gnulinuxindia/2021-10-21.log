[08:13:58] <gtlsgamr> that's a very vague question
[08:14:03] <gtlsgamr> what data does the json have?
[08:14:08] <gtlsgamr> you can use any json parser
[08:14:31] <Arya[m]> <irc-open-up> "it could be there in JSON" <- you can grep for it
[08:14:34] <Arya[m]> use jq
[08:15:47] <gtlsgamr> If he could grep for it... he would already know the password
[08:16:54] <Arya[m]> I was grepping an export for my bw passwd export. What i did was i did grep -i "google\.com" -A10 so i get the next 10 lines
[08:17:06] <gtlsgamr> That is kind atrue
[08:17:08] <gtlsgamr> true
[09:14:18] <purpux> Hello ! I am trying to emulate Windows 11 with QEMU/KVM. I have successfully emulated tpm, UEFI and all requirements for Windows 11 to run. However, even after adding the necessary command line options to qemu, secure boot does not work. I get an error: "Guest has not initialized display (yet)".
[09:14:48] <purpux> I have added https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface#OVMF_for_virtual_machines as per the arch linux wiki
[09:14:57] <purpux> however, secure boot just does not work.
[09:15:21] <purpux> Note that windows 11 boots without secure boot, but refuses to install without it
[09:15:30] <Arya[m]> purpux: see mutahar (some ordinary gamers) 's video about it
[09:16:01] <purpux> Arya[m]: I did. The problem is that I'm not using virt-manager or libvirt, and I do not desire to do so
[09:16:22] <purpux> further more, I added the same .fd file that he did as a pflash
[09:16:25] <purpux> but it did nothing
[09:17:33] <Arya[m]> qemu alone wont give that much performance will it
[09:18:32] <purpux> Arya[m]: libvirt is wrapper and virt-manager is just a GUI if I'm not wrong. I don't think they add functionality, just making it easier
[09:18:39] <purpux> https://github.com/Purpux/virt-machines
[09:18:49] <purpux> ^ my git repo for the scripts I use to install
[09:18:59] <Arya[m]> ok
[09:22:54] <pystardust> irc-open-up: passwords won't be there just like that, ull probably find a hashed one

[09:39:51] <palwd> hey
[09:48:50] *** Joins: vipulogmx (vipulogmx@vipulogmx.oddprotocol.org)
[09:54:58] <pystardust> hey palwd, hows it going
[09:55:30] <pystardust> you use transmission-daemon too ryt? I want to add a torrent fetch its metadata (magnet links
[09:55:43] <pystardust> magnet link's metadata) but not download it
[09:56:06] <pystardust> Do you know of any way it only fetches metadata and doesn't start?
[10:08:58] <palwd> I think transmission-show is what you are looking for
[10:09:32] <palwd> it has a -m flag which is fo magnet links
[10:10:44] <palwd> oh wait its only for .torrent files
[10:10:46] <pystardust> that converts a torrent file into magnet. Im looking for the opposite
[10:10:53] <palwd> yeah my bad
[10:12:16] <pystardust> I wanna download a magnet link, but I wanna specify files. I can do that with transmission-remote -G all -g 1,2 . But for that I need a torrent file or I need torrent meta data, else itll start downloading everything
[10:13:33] <palwd> ahh
[10:14:22] <palwd> yeah what I usually do is just add it, and then select the files which I want afterwards
[10:14:42] <palwd> haven't found out a way to do it before
[10:14:43] <pystardust> that leaves some part files
[10:14:59] <pystardust> https://trac.transmissionbt.com/ticket/4808 , apparently  there seems to be no way
[10:19:43] <palwd> is there a way to get a .torrent file with a magent link?
[10:28:28] <pystardust> don't know, there seems to be online ways but using transmission maybe not
[10:28:43] <pystardust> palwd: found this, ill build from source itll work then https://github.com/transmission/transmission/pull/1080
[10:29:27] <palwd> yeah apparently aria2c can download the torrent file from a magent link
[10:31:20] <palwd> so with the patch you have to specify in your config right, that you would like to pause after metadata is downloaded?
[10:36:15] <pystardust> no the patch downloads meta data even when paused, so if I start the torrent paused then it would download the meta data
[10:38:43] <palwd> ahh alright

[10:53:45] <irc-open-up> Arya[m]: yea turns out password was not there in it. pystardust Right there were two JSON file one of them were hashed.... if i could reverse engineer the apk and look for pdf password from there
[10:54:09] <irc-open-up> Arya[m]: what do you mean by export
[10:55:07] <irc-open-up> vipulogmx: are you there?
[10:58:00] <irc-open-up> pystardust: actually vi in terminal is niice :)
[11:00:06] <pystardust> irc-open-up: you can use a disctionary word cracker or some online database which has tons of hashed passwords cracked to find it out
[11:00:15] <pystardust> yup vi is great
[11:33:09] <Arya[m]> <irc-open-up> "Arya: what do you mean by export" <- I exported my passwords from my bitwarden 
[11:35:42] <Arya[m]> Just a small thing i found about vim :P. If you open a /etc config without root by mistake and do a lot of edits you can just :w ~/config and then mv the file into the correct dir
[12:04:03] <gtlsgamr> I knew we could do this, but I never thought to do this

[20:48:51] <mysticbtw[m]>  * Can you elaborate on how do you do that?
[20:48:51] <mysticbtw[m]> Tremc has broken function with latest python as it does not open files menu.
[20:48:51] <mysticbtw[m]> And i couldnt deselect files via
[20:48:51] <mysticbtw[m]> > transmission-remote -t 12 --no-get 1 It ignores and dowloads it all
