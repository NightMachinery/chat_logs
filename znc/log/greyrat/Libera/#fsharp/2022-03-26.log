[00:41:36] <sonny> what style do you prefer? https://bpa.st/D3HA
[00:55:21] <MatthiasVance> You don't need to use .ToString() I think?
[00:55:25] <MatthiasVance> You can just use string
[00:55:35] <MatthiasVance> reader.ReadToEnd() |> string
[00:57:54] <MatthiasVance> sonny: ^
[00:59:32] <sonny> I forgot about those type things
[00:59:39] <sonny> good call
[01:04:59] <sonny> MatthiasVance: I need a lexer, any recommendations?
[01:05:15] <MatthiasVance> Hm no it has been a long time since I needed one
[01:05:34] <sonny> I might end up making one
[01:05:57] <sonny> I'm doing advent of code and I'd like to be less distracted by the parsing bit
[01:06:34] <MatthiasVance> There is a de facto standard parser for F#
[01:06:48] <MatthiasVance> FParsec
[01:07:01] <MatthiasVance> Not sure if that's useful for you?
[01:07:41] <sonny> it will be, though it seems like overkill
[01:08:16] <sonny> can you explain why I need the parentheses? `use reader = new StreamReader (path)`
[01:09:45] <MatthiasVance> Not in technical terms :D
[01:11:13] <MatthiasVance> So basically, no I can't

[01:51:23] <sonny> MatthiasVance: had to step out, and now I'm back. Well, that's disappointing to hear.
[01:52:14] <MatthiasVance> I know it's because of the "new", but not exactly why
[01:52:21] <MatthiasVance> If you do it without it's fine
[01:52:36] <sonny> yeah, but new is required in some cases
[01:52:40] <MatthiasVance> And I know "it wants you" to use new because it's disposable, but still
[01:53:00] <sonny> it would be interesting to figure out why
[01:54:27] <MatthiasVance> Technically you don't need "new"
[01:54:35] <MatthiasVance> The warning is only there to remind you to use "use"
[01:54:45] <MatthiasVance> https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/issues/124
[01:56:22] <sonny> ah
[01:59:34] <sonny> what type is forward in the Groups sequence <https://bpa.st/Y4FQ>
[02:00:24] <sonny> I would like to see all captures of the Group named forward
[02:02:13] <sonny> the type is Group, just realized that I'm looking at a record
[02:31:33] <sonny> can you reference anonymous tuples? `let mutable postion = 0, 0 // horizontal, depth`
[02:31:45] <sonny> by position*
[02:35:34] <sonny> oh I can name them
[02:35:48] <sonny> let (horizontal, depth) = 0, 0

[05:33:00] <ggb> Is there a way to define how `string myTypeVal` stringifies a type I've defined?
[05:38:32] <ggb> It doesn't seem to use a <type>.ToString() method defined on a type.
