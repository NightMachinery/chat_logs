[13:05:43] <rendar> a debian distribution, like jessie, or bullseye, will stick to a kernel branch, like 5.10, for its entire life, or it can upgrade to a newer branch, like 5.11 ?
[13:06:22] <Khepra> Ueb: ssh_config for the client side, so it disconnects soone when it detects tcp has gone belly up. BUT ... I'm not 100% how autossh instruments ssh. via lib or the ssh(1) client
[13:06:24] <jelly> rendar, Debian tries hard to stick with one branch within a release lifetime.
[13:06:39] <Khepra> Ueb: in that I'm not 100% if it uses appropriate configs. I _think_ it does.
[13:06:45] <personx_> Khepra, yeah those discussions have been had. we're going to try anyway. the per mailbox pricing is just not reasonable to me. anyhow, we definitely would prefer being able to download complete offline copies of the certain mailboxes too for proper backup/storage 'cause someone of them are almost 20GB with all emails/attachments.
[13:06:50] <rendar> jelly, "tries hard"? can you explain that?
[13:07:23] <jelly> rendar, "as long as it's technically feasible"
[13:07:28] <rendar> i see
[13:07:47] <rendar> so, sticking with a kernel branch for the entire lifetime of a release, is seen as a good thing
[13:08:06] <Khepra> personx_: for backup, check that offlineimap (fetchmail and others). but pricing IS reasonable. I've been in email business for over 10 years. it has never been so bad as recently. despite the infra, logistics, experience, well trained spam filters, we're losing battle and advising clients to migrate to o365 or gsuite.
[13:08:45] <jelly> rendar, sticking to same version of ANY software is a good thing in terms of avoiding new bugs

[13:25:58] <rendar> Khepra, lol, let's say 5.15
[13:26:11] <Khepra> yeah. that works. I run that, in production even.
[13:26:20] <rendar> ok bullseye?
[13:26:23] <Khepra> yes
[13:26:43] <rendar> Khepra, can i ask you how you managed to get a newer kernel in bullseye?
[13:26:53] <Khepra> with custom kernel.org kernel. I don't like debian's policy around kernel. but see? I can easily make such exceptions, while the rest of the OS stays put and curated.
[13:27:13] <rendar> you downloaded a kernel, and compiled it?
[13:27:24] <Khepra> the upstream has debian specific Makefile targets. it makes it VERY easy to download, make the .deb and apt install it.
[13:27:26] <jelly> Debian is an excellent _platform_ where stuff stays stable (in an "not moving" sense); sometimes people need specific components changed for whatever reason
[13:27:58] <rendar> jelly, i agree on that, but i also realize that the world moves very fast, especially in the security field
[13:28:16] <Khepra> rendar: the worst part is knowing which options to enable AND disable. you can always start from debian's configs for earlier versions, and go from there.

[13:29:40] <Khepra> infact quite the contrary
[13:29:58] <Khepra> one thing I love about this is that my AppArmor profiles don't need to be changed for long time
[13:30:01] <jelly> rendar, Debian backports specific security fixes to versions of software that's present in the current release.
[13:30:13] <jelly> that's what Debian Security Team does.
[13:30:14] <rendar> Khepra, in production, you install new patches every day
[13:30:24] <Khepra> rendar: only if they're available and NEEDED
[13:30:35] <rendar> ok
[13:30:36] <jelly> in production you don't fucking change things every day, no
[13:30:39] <Khepra> for MOST kernel upgrades I don't reboot because they don't affect my platforms.
[13:30:51] <rendar> so with a simple apt-get upgrade in bullseye, i will get the latest security patches?
[13:31:11] <Khepra> I use kernel.org kernels, so that means new kern every few days. I read the changelogs. I make an informed decision whether to upgrade+reboot or not.
[13:31:35] <Khepra> this is called knowing and understanding your system. you want security? you better learn it.
[13:31:44] <rendar> Khepra, yes, that makes sense
[13:31:46] <Khepra> (speaking in general, not "you" you)

[13:32:48] <dpkg> dist-upgrade tells apt to also install/remove packages when handling dependencies; security updates may require a dist-upgrade to install (they introduce new packages).  Dist-upgrade does not mean changing from stable to testing; apt and aptitude both call dist-upgrade "full-upgrade" to remove this confusion.  Read man apt-get carefully.

[13:33:18] <Khepra> I'd just like to point out that one giant exception to what jelly says, are backported packages. there's zero guarantees about those. for example, the buster backports 5.10 kernel is severely out of date and vulnerable. better DIY if you need to backport and go beyond stable packaged.

[13:34:58] <Khepra> stable is really nicely patched for security. oldstable isn't, in my opinion, though some here would disargee.
[13:35:16] <rendar> yes, i agree on that
[13:35:48] <Khepra> rendar: in MY case, I need 5.12+ kernels for some hardware we use (amdgpus). and I find some security feeatures in 5.15 very nice so if I'm already using kernel.org, just use the latest stable. I _will_ stick with 5.15 LTS tho, won't go beyond.

[18:44:43] <dpkg> You can install Debian from a USB stick/thumbdrive/pen drive/key on x86 systems, as long as your system's BIOS can boot from USB.  Details are in the Installation Guide, see http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/ch04s03 and ask me about <install debian> for hybrid CD/DVD images.  Use http://sf.net/projects/win32diskimager/ to write images from Windows.  For BIOSes not capable of USB boot, ask me about <plop>.

[22:05:13] <cosimone> this is probably going to sound like a ridiculous question, but i can't seem to find a satisfactory answer: what is, in the year of our lord 2022, the best way to get a nice graphical password prompt to run graphical applications as another (non-root) user?
[22:05:14] <Khepra> because it's so convoluted that nobody understand how it really works and can't write one from scratch if they wanted to?  :)
[22:05:24] <jelly> anddam, if you're making binary debs manually like a common peasant, then yes you'll have to fix Installed-Size, md5sums and such
[22:05:58] <cosimone> right now, i'm using su -l <user> -c <command> after setting xhost and a pulseaudio local server appropriately.  EVERYTHING works fine except for the annoyance of opening a terminal for the prompt!
[22:06:12] <cosimone> i can work around it by backgrounding it and using "disown", but it's not as convenient as a dedicated prompt
[22:06:28] <shtrb> cosimone, you can have .desktop file , you can use kdesu too
[22:06:42] <Khepra> cosimone: something something polkit
[22:06:48] <jelly> cosimone, all I know is: not sux, not ksu/ksudo, not anything pkexec...

[22:07:37] <cosimone> how would a .desktop file help me?
[22:07:54] <Khepra> jelly: doesn't pkexec actually invoke gui password prompt, when x11 is detected?
[22:07:58] <gurur_> well you would put pkexec before the program you want to execute
[22:08:00] <greycat> Isn't the entire concept of running GUI applications as a different user supposed to be bad now?  Wayland makes it impossible, right?

[22:08:41] <Khepra> greycat: right. that's why my previous patterns of runnig different progs as different users, totaly fails under wayland
[22:08:46] <cosimone> the stuff i run uses x11 anyway, and using xhost works fine
[22:08:58] <greycat> (why people WANT to do this still eludes my imagination)
[22:09:02] <Khepra> xorg had a public socket in /tmp . wayland compositors may or may not do the same.
