[00:50:35] <aphysically> Well, there's an actual fix we need to do, which is that we made it always valid to use Annotated on the outside of annotations, and dataclasses uses typing annotations but doesn't recognize that Annotated can be on the outside

[01:38:08] <aphysically> I think that's actually what Guido was getting at in a comment on the bug I reported
[01:38:42] <aphysically> he pointed out the bug I found is similar to another weird typing bug in that they both involve forward references wrapped in something else
[01:39:09] <micah> i'm trying to do this: https://bpa.st/YFNA but I'm getting 'TypeError: can't concat list to bytes' for line 14, and I'm not seeing what it is
[01:39:13] <aphysically> so maybe we should revisit forward references wrapped in something else and make sure they're properly tested in general + audit that part of typing.py
[01:40:17] <SnoopJ> aphysically, I was thinking more along the lines of "...requires you to *also* call get_type_hints" which sounds like a thing that isn't being done enough in the test suite
[01:40:18] <aphysically> regarding making sure stuff like get_type_hints is called, that seems tricky for the way the typing tests are laid out
[01:40:46] <SnoopJ> mm
[01:40:46] <aphysically> there is a part of thte test suite that tests get_type_hints a lot, but it doesn't overlap fully with the part of the test suite that tests everything else

[03:09:03] <Guest92> Hi, What is the pythonic way of handling single byte octets while iterating over a "bytes" instance?
[03:09:03] <Guest92> The program reads byte octets from an infinite binary stream and processes them in a state machine to extract some meaningful data.
[03:09:04] <Guest92> There are some ways to handle a single byte octet:
[03:09:04] <Guest92> bytes([octet]), octet.to_bytes(1, "big"), struct.pack('B', octet), chr(octet).encode('latin-1'), etc.
[03:09:05] <Guest92> Also, PEP 467 has introduced bytes.getbyte() for Python3.11+ which is not the current stable version.

[04:19:00] <potatosal> how can I extract elements by priority from a list? e.g. I want to prioritize 3 numbers (100 1st,90 2nd,80 3rd) and if none of them exist in the list then return nothing. In the [100,90,80,70,60,50] example, it should return 100. [90,80,70,60,50] returns 90. [70,60,50] returns none, etc... I hope that makes sense

[05:50:35] <SnoopJ> d1rewolf, what about the start?
[05:51:30] <d1rewolf> SnoopJ: so far (still analyzing) it seems that there's a common sentence right before the table header
[05:51:34] <d1rewolf> and then the header itself of course

[06:05:50] <d1rewolf> or at least obsoleted. I can't believe companies still choose a format that is so difficult to parse from a data perspective

[06:06:08] <d1rewolf> we need a format designed for display *and* data consumption

[06:09:55] <BrenBarn> so you could just stick a whole CSV or whatever in a data block
[06:10:05] <SnoopJ> probably half a dozen of them

[06:10:38] <SnoopJ> nedbat, I came fully over into the "PDF has jumped the shark" camp when I saw an interactive 3D model embedded in a PDF document
[06:10:58] <nedbat> voldial: i shouldn't be hard to parse out a character class (r"[AC-F]") and generate the values.
[06:11:00] <sco1> Wait till you see what people do with Excel sheets

[12:18:30] <apollo13> probably c code involved which prevents python from throwing a recursion error or so (dunno never seen the stack overflow myself)

[13:55:59] <supakeen> Because normalize-space only takes the first node.
[13:56:50] <supakeen> e.g. `normalize-space(//foo)` will take the first node from the //foo nodeset, convert it to a string and then normalize-space on that string
[13:57:58] <supakeen> Generally I wouldn't use normalize-space as an output thing, just as a selector thing, you can do the normalization afterwards on the nodes you matched in the programming language you are using.

[16:03:14] <wyre> hi guys, can I include a specific version for a dependency of some requirement which is placed in requirements.txt?
[16:03:40] <d1rewolf> morning/evening all. I am relatively new to python properties. In this code I would expect award_date's type to be datetime, but it's still the original string when I call it

[20:16:02] <kittonian> it's a zsql method which simply makes a db call (whatever that might be). the select statements are as simple as select * from table, select keywords from table, or select keywords, keywords as keyword2 from table
[20:16:11] <ssbr> rapha: this should be possible with a sufficiently advanced xquery engine probably, but who even has that? the other way would be to walk the DOM and run the regexp on each span of text

[20:16:49] <rapha> ssbr: i'd prefer not to use regular expressions and XML files together at all, _especially_ when there is objectively no reason for doing so at all. it's dangerous.
[20:16:55] <ssbr> rapha: the only reason to run on the source code of the XML is if you're searching for source code -- for text, this will incorrectly dig into elements where it shouldn't, fail to expand entities, etc.
[20:16:56] <kittonian> the context line at the top of the python script I posted calls the zsql method
[20:16:58] <nedbat> kittonian: where is the definition of context.zsql.usernames_disallowed_select() ?
[20:17:05] <grym> rapha: ia ia the pony he comes, etc.
[20:17:10] <ssbr> rapha: Yeah, that's my point. But there's nothing wrong with running regexps on text, even if the text came from XML files
[20:17:17] <kittonian> the name of the zsql method is usernames.disallowed.select
[20:17:34] <ssbr> rapha: that's what the xquery or XML DOM walk would let you do -- just look at the text you're interested in, rather than the XML source code.
[20:17:48] <kittonian> it is in the current context (i.e. the current folder) and then within a subfolder called zsql, hence context.zsql.usernames_disallowed_select
[20:17:49] <InPhase> rapha: Rather than "does not have" I should have said "has something other than", as a bare '.' would not match.

[20:20:37] <ssbr> rapha: Honestly I think what they're doing is reasonable: they don't want to write the full XML parsing thing, they just quickly *prototyped* a regexp that matches what they want. As part of productionizing this, you do the proper XML parsing. Everyone wins here -- you get a relatively clear spec of the problem, they get to avoid doing Real Programming that they may no longer be very qualified to do
[20:21:04] <ssbr> of course it might've been better if they did the regexp on the text file, but in the end you'd get basically the same thing, absent the temporary confusion about what the regexp is doing
[20:21:26] <kittonian> nedbat, it's literally just a change of for k line to be for k,i and then changing value.append({"keyword": k}) to value.append({"keyword": k, "keyword2": i})

[20:38:28] <nedbat> kittonian: and the reason i can suggest that is because of the *other* line that changed between the two example, the "for k in" line.

[23:45:27] <SnoopJ> sydbarret, assume the answer is 'yes' and ask the next question, if there is one
[23:45:49] <The-Compiler> stewie925: FWIW it looks like that's a bug in KiwiIRC (the webclient you use): https://github.com/kiwiirc/kiwiirc/issues/1433
[23:46:33] <stewie925> The-Compiler: yes I am using kiwi
[23:46:35] <sydbarret> SnoopJ im trying to convert from google adwords api to google ads api these 2 lines of code:   oauth2.GoogleRefreshTokenClient(client_id, client_secret, refresh_token)  and adwords.AdWordsClient(developer_token, oauth2_client, user_agent)
[23:47:27] <stewie925> The-Compiler: a-ha! ` back ticks are not closed if there is no space `

[23:47:55] <The-Compiler> stewie925: spaces aren't the problem I think, mainly commas after the closing backtick: `foo` vs. `bar`, like here
