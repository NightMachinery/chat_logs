[00:38:57] <hoppity> I am having an issue where Firefox does not cache images from a Phoenix app. Some googling revealed this to be due to the vsn query string.. Is anyone familiar?
[00:43:10] <hoppity> It's weird, clicking on my app logo to go back "home" things are nice and fast. But if I reload the page it can take up to 5 seconds to load he whole page due to javascript and images and they are not being cached on Windows nor Linux.
[01:05:19] <benwilson512> hoppity: are you sure that firefox's reload behavior is not "ignore the cache" ?
[01:05:45] <benwilson512> does regular clicking around seem to use the cache
[01:05:46] <benwilson512> ?
[01:06:05] <hoppity> benwilson512: yes, clicking around does use cache fine
[01:06:22] <hoppity> I found someone saying that Firefox's default behavior for the reload button is to not use cache here: https://elixirforum.com/t/the-vsn-d-query-parameter-causes-firefox-to-not-cache-assets/27065
[01:06:48] <hoppity> But I haven't been able to confirm that is the case since ctrl + f5 should be the command to reload with no cache

[02:12:59] <bitwalker> anyone got a good suggestion for how I can link traces for Ecto queries which I generate via a telemetry handler on repo events, to say, the trace associated to the request the query is being executed for?
[02:13:31] <bitwalker> As far as I can tell, there isn't any way to get the caller pid for the query in the telemetry handler, and thereby be able to dig into the callers process dictionary for the trace context
[02:19:14] <josevalim> The caller pid is self()

[02:40:48] <bitwalker> josevalim: as in, that's the pid of the process from which the repo function was called (e.g. Repo.get), or from the adapter process (e.g. the connection process)
[02:45:04] <bitwalker> I ended up using the `$ancestors` pdict key to do what I had in mind, but I'm curious if I missed something. I wasn't getting my trace contexts linked without the workaround, so I'm assuming that `self()` in the telemetry handler for Ecto isn't the process I think it is
[02:46:12] *** Joins: odoood (~odoood@2601:c8:c003:a550::c)
[03:02:19] <josevalim> self() is the caller
[03:02:35] <josevalim> With the exception of parallel preloading that should be the case
[03:04:47] <joshproehl> I'm trying to abuse Ecto a bit with a model (Game) that has a player1_id and player2_id on it. I know I could do 2 has_many fields (games_as_player1, games_as_player2), but I'm wondering if there's some way I can use something like select_merge on my custom join query to create a list of the associated schemas as a virtual field.

[11:59:14] <dcz> is there some established, simple way to package the templates/ directory together with the release build?
[12:03:30] <dcz> :rel_templates_path doesn't seem to do anything https://hexdocs.pm/mix/1.12/Mix.Tasks.Release.html
[12:03:56] <Nicd> dcz: put it in priv/ directory
[12:07:19] <dcz> not much success after `mix release --version prod`: could not read file "priv/templates/show_posts.eex": no such file or directory
[12:08:21] <dcz> (that's a runtime error)
[12:10:33] <Nicd> did you check if it actually exists in the built release's priv directory? also use `Application.app_dir(YourApp, "priv/templates/...")` to get correct path to it in release
[12:11:20] <dcz> yes, and I'm not seeing it there
[12:12:28] <dcz> there's no 'priv' directory anywhere in _build
[12:12:51] <Nicd> hmm, by default priv directory should be bundled with release
[12:13:36] <Nicd> it should be in <release>/lib/<app-name>-<app-version>/priv
[12:14:22] <dcz> oh, I ignored lib thinking it was only for deps. yes, it's there
[12:14:41] <dcz> Application.app_dir is probably what I want then
[12:14:51] <Nicd> yep
[12:15:32] <Nicd> can I ask why you are including templates this way and not building them into the source like e.g. Phoenix does?
[12:15:59] <dcz> I don't know how to do that
[12:19:02] <Nicd> something like this I guess: https://hexdocs.pm/eex/EEx.html#function_from_file/5 -- if you want to use plain EEx
[12:20:17] <dcz> thanks, that's useful
[12:20:32] <Nicd> I assume you're using EEx.eval_file otherwise?
[12:23:45] <dcz> yes, I'm trying to convert now
[12:24:15] *** Joins: fwg (~fwg@user/fwg)
[12:25:02] <Nicd> if you have low request volume then eval_file may not be an issue speed-wise, but of course compiling the templates in saves you from putting them in priv folder (they can live in lib instead)
[12:25:42] <Nicd> note that plain EEx doesn't do any HTML escaping for you for the input values
[12:26:19] <Nicd> so if you do `<%= a %>` and `a` contains `<script>malicious</script>`, then it will come out as is
[12:26:51] <dcz> I'm only worried about deploying, because it's not something I understand yet. And yeah, EExHTML.Engine is my friend :)
[12:27:30] <Nicd> good, I've also used that. there is also now a package that contains the Phoenix view parts and that includes the Phoenix EEx engine

[22:11:09] <bitwalker> josevalim: is it expected that use of an underscored binding within a block that was decorated with `generated: true` still produces the warning about use of an underscored binding? I was expecting that warning to be ignored in such a case, but I know there isn't necessarily a guarantee about which warnings are silenced by `generated: true`

[22:45:09] <Nicd> so I use `:httpc` in a mix task and it gives a warning "warning: :httpc.request/4 defined in application :inets is used by the current application but the current application does not depend on :inets."
[22:45:31] <Nicd> but this is a development only task and the project otherwise doesn't depend on :inets
[22:46:44] <Nicd> though it's a library, so I don't really know the implication of adding :inets to extra_applications
[22:46:52] <Nicd> is it harmless?
