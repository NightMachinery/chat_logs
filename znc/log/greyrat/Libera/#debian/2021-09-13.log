[03:27:48] <brutex> on boot
[03:28:38] <somiaj> either your root filesystem is incorrectly configured, you don't have the module for the file system in your initramfs, or you didn't build that filesystem into your kernel

[03:30:31] <brutex> it'sa initramfs issue?
[03:31:02] <somiaj> I don't know, that is why I listed options, since you are not using a stock kernel, it could be you didn't include the correct configuration to build the module for your filesystem
[03:31:19] *** Joins: GenTooMan (~cyberman@2601:547:437f:e5c6:21f:5bff:fefe:a883)
[03:31:21] <somiaj> it could also be a grub issue and your root filesystem isn't pointing at the correct device
[03:31:28] <brutex> somiaj: so what to do to add i need to add initramfs support in kernel configuration?
[03:31:37] <somiaj> I notice it says /dev/sdb, but what if it is really /dev/sda and you should be using UUIDs
[03:32:01] <somiaj> no you are initramfs, so it is built correctly, why are you trying to build a kernel, you seem out of your league
[03:32:10] <brutex> it's in /dev/sdb debian /dev/sdb2 on /dev/sda it's UEFI
[03:32:12] <brutex> booting
[03:32:34] <brutex> always i have build it correct
[03:32:35] <somiaj> okay just making sure that it wasn't due to adding/remove a usb to recover your system
[03:32:46] <brutex> i don't know this is my first time that doesnt work
[03:33:44] <brutex> somiaj: what you recommend to check the kernel configuration?
[03:34:50] <somiaj> I would (a) check that your grub is correct, (b) check that the filesystem module was correctly built in your custom kernel, (c) check the initramfs
[03:35:07] <brutex> ok

[03:36:02] <brutex> i will check all other
[03:36:04] <somiaj> lsinitramfs will list all the contents
[03:36:12] <brutex> ok
[03:36:42] <somiaj> another issue isn't the filesystem, it is the hd modular (stata, m2, etc
[03:36:52] <brutex> mhm
[03:37:03] <somiaj> but anyways, just debug, think about the errors and repeate
[03:37:10] <somiaj> but you still haven't answered me, why are you building a custom kernel?
[03:37:11] <brutex> ok
[03:37:27] <brutex> not sure
[03:37:33] <brutex> maybe more stable
[03:37:35] <brutex> last
[03:37:58] <brutex> what do you think?
[03:38:21] <somiaj> Most likely you won't get a more stable kernel buidling it yourself, the debian kernels are well made, so stability issues are bugs in the source more than the build
[03:38:40] <brutex> i see
[03:38:44] <brutex> ok
[03:39:15] <somiaj> It is okay to build because you want to learn, but you should try to read the docs and debug this a little on your own, but for some reason you are running against a lot of issues.

[04:13:08] <maledictium> Hi guys. Not a debian question per se. I want to encrypt a partition with dm-crypt and the general recomendation is to fill it with zeros before (which for a 1TB partition will take a lot of time). Why is it so? Encrypting it by itself shouldn't be enough to guarantee protection against physical adversaries?
[04:14:14] *** Quits: diogenes_ (~diogenes_@62.141.215.189) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[04:14:33] <tjcarter> maledictium: it's somewhat a complex topic, but disk encryption (e.g. LUKS or any other for that matter) can't be "as good" as just encrypting a single file, ever.
[04:14:40] *** Joins: sinaowolabi (~SinaOwola@102.134.114.1)
[04:14:45] <tjcarter> The reason is that the disk has to be modifiable
[04:15:13] <tjcarter> To make it a little stronger, you can hide where exactly there is encrypted data and where there isn't
[04:15:31] <n4dir> maledictium: i lack the terms, but i think that if there was data on the disk *before*, someone could access that data if he really wants to.
[04:15:46] <tjcarter> there's also that
[04:16:04] <tjcarter> but in the age of SSDs it's hard to even argue that matters
[04:16:07] <n4dir> point is: if it was empty before, there is no need to fill it with zeros
[04:16:15] *** Joins: sinaowolabi_ (~SinaOwola@102.134.114.1)
[04:16:23] <maledictium> tjcarter: but how can he access it if its already encrypted? this is what puzzles me
[04:16:25] <tjcarter> what I can say is that if you encrypt a drive, you NEVER need to write random data to it again if you reformat
[04:16:26] <somiaj> in general if you care enough to encrypt the data, it is worth taking the time to follow the recommendtions such as zeroing the drive first
[04:16:48] <tjcarter> maledictium: by cracking the encryption, which is unfortunately easier to do than it would be for a single encrypted file
[04:17:02] <tjcarter> how MUCH easier … depends on your level of paranoia.
[04:17:15] <tjcarter> (in other words, I can't do it.)
[04:17:31] <n4dir> i can be added to the ones who can't do it.
[04:17:48] <maledictium> hmm ok,you mean brute forcing it? the passphrase?
[04:17:56] <n4dir> I could easily recover data from a donated old PC which was not encrypted though.
[04:18:11] <tjcarter> no, I mean cracking it so you don't have to determine what the passphrase was
[04:18:11] <maledictium> this partition already had data before

[04:18:44] <tjcarter> basically, if you're not worried about government level entities taking a shot at your drive, you probably don't need to worry
[04:18:44] <somiaj> maledictium: well not brute force, but one can gain info about the encryption they couldn't if you zeroed first, that information can make cracking faster/easier.
[04:19:11] <tjcarter> arguably, on NVMe, there's not a whole lot you can do unless the drive has a cryptographic erasure
[04:19:13] <somiaj> though I too am in the category, I don't know what info that is, but I would follow the recommendations, just have it zero over night
[04:19:29] <tjcarter> same would be true for SSD SATA drives
[04:19:40] <maledictium> somiaj: ok,it already starts to make sense
[04:19:51] <tjcarter> somiaj: I did a zero once.
[04:19:58] <tjcarter> ONCE.
[04:20:05] <tjcarter> I won't do it again on these drives.
[04:20:27] <maledictium> yes,the drive is nvme
[04:20:36] <somiaj> but here again, just as with all things secuirty, what is your security model, what are you wanting to protect this information from, that could also affect the choice.
[04:20:37] <tjcarter> (zero is incorrect—I wrote random data, I just pulled that random data from /dev/zero and let LUKS do the randomization)
[04:21:38] <tjcarter> once the data on the drive is scrambled once, the data on the drive is effectively already randomized if the key is wiped and a new encrypted partition is created.
[04:21:56] <tjcarter> (so save yourself some NAND write cycles!)

[06:33:38] *** Joins: malloy (~jimery@116.30.220.230)
[06:33:39] <somiaj> dmesg can be very verbose and lots of warnings/errors can be safely ignored if your system is running correctly
[06:34:22] <somiaj> in this case you should also provide us more info than just those errors, out of context it is hard to say.
[06:34:35] <blackop> somiaj: i setup lvm-encryption while partitioning hdd
[06:34:40] <blackop> amateurly
[06:34:45] <somiaj> my first thought with i915 is do you have firmware-misc-nonfree installed?
[06:34:49] <blackop> but i think it went through
[06:35:02] <somiaj> those errors have nothing to do with lvm/encryption/file storage
[06:35:11] <blackop> i dont have any intel firmware installed but i set sources.list non-free

[06:35:38] <blackop> well if that count
[06:35:40] <blackop> s

[06:35:52] <blackop> giving errors
[06:35:59] <blackop> not sure if it is related to graphics

[06:36:39] <blackop> somiaj: i will install it\
[06:36:41] <somiaj> Khepra: many gpus will give basic 2d support without firmware, and many i915 cards don't even need it
[06:37:08] <somiaj> but based on the errors (which is about all the info we have), if they were having any issues with xorg/waylend on the machine the firmware is the first suggestion
[06:37:16] <somiaj> but so far their issues seem to be non-related to the actual output shared

[06:37:44] <Khepra> yeah so far the issues are completely unrelated to each other

[06:37:57] <Khepra> i915 dmesg errors; something something lvm; unable to vnc
[06:38:04] <blackop> but maybe i need to reboot after non-free firmware install?
[06:38:23] <Khepra> probably
[06:38:54] <Khepra> or at least, re-insert the kernel module, but it's faster to just reboot
[06:40:14] <somiaj> blackop: you would have to reboot to load the firmware, and so far that message you see has little to do with any issues you seemt o have
[06:40:35] <blackop> still same
[06:40:36] <somiaj> Khepra: I think with kms modules that is a bit hard since I think they are sometimes loaded via efi layer
[06:41:00] <somiaj> blackop: again, the kernel is very verbose. Do you have any problems with your gpu outside these errors?
[06:41:16] <blackop> it hanged long time at black screen when i click on reboot when it tried to logout
[06:41:16] <Khepra> yeah, but just sayin' it's not reboot per se that's required, just module re-load. technically, that sometimes means reboot only
[06:41:32] <Khepra> it's, like, a side note to "do I ahve to reboot"

[07:53:11] <asarch> One stupid question: why every time I change something in the "BIOS configuration" the UEFI partition (Debian) cannot boot (the system cannot detect any booteable partition at all)? Is it because the Desktop battery is too old?
[07:54:43] <somiaj> Hard to say, in changing things are you resetting settings? I would assume if the battery was old it would forget all settings in cases you didn't modify the bios/firmware
[07:55:06] <somiaj> maybe a buggy bios (are there any upgrades avilable) in which it resets things after changing other things

[08:01:52] *** Joins: crazyfrog_ (~crazyfrog@user/crazyfrog)
[08:02:13] <somiaj> it really depends on the bios, most require you use some freedos live image and upgrade from there
[08:02:24] <somiaj> some can be upgraded from linux directly, though these seem to be a bit rarer

[08:03:58] <somiaj> more and more I'm seeing ones that can be upgraded from the firmware itself, so you just provide a copy of the upgrade on a usb stick and can upgrade it using firmware tools, those are the ones I like
[08:04:20] <somiaj> but use grml to boot freedos and run an .exe to upgrade is also fairly common

[13:28:26] <shad> can Gnome use Xorg ? Does it matter ?
[13:29:02] <alkisg> Sure it can. Yes it matters, then xorg can handle the displays instead of wayland

[14:30:27] <eblip> i have looked and apt-get install python3-pip
[14:30:34] <Khepra> eblip: hold the phone
[14:30:36] <eblip> but it is currently at the latest version
[14:30:52] <Khepra> shouldn't use pip outside of a virtualenv where it's installed automatically.
[14:31:01] <eblip> i am inside the virtual env
[14:31:10] <Khepra> how did you create it?
[14:31:47] <eblip> do you mean create the virtual env or do you mean how did i activate it
[14:31:57] <Khepra> how did you create the virtualenv
[14:32:31] <Khepra> python3 -m venv /path/to/venv/dir  ?
[14:33:17] <eblip> python3 -m venv /home/eb0t/envs/<project nick>
[14:33:39] <Khepra> right, and then you activated it with  `source /home/eb0t/envs/.../activate`    yes?
[14:33:44] <eblip> yes
[14:33:50] <Khepra> so, is pip not available?
[14:33:55] <eblip> no
[14:33:58] <Khepra> I don't believe it
[14:34:04] <eblip> but my machine says its installed
[14:34:05] <Khepra> you did something else then
[14:34:26] <eblip> the environment looks activated
[14:34:35] <eblip> but i cant even do pip3 version
[14:34:37] <Khepra> pip is automatically installed and available as, should be available as, /home/eb0t/envs/.../bin/pip
[14:34:52] <Khepra> it's also an importable module, if you run `python3` with activated venv
[14:34:54] *** Quits: johnjay (~pi@192.142.100.38) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[14:35:31] <Khepra> "activating" a venv merely adjusts PATH so that python3 and pip are referenced from the venv directory FIRST, and then the usual paths like /usr/bin/ and friends
[14:35:51] <Khepra> so you can use relative OR absolute paths, it's the same thing. pip is there, both as command and module, if you used  `python3 -m venv`
[14:35:54] <eblip> https://bpa.st/7CYQ
[14:36:51] <Khepra> you're not in the virtualenv then

[17:34:47] <Khepra> and unless that "operating system" is debian, and you need help with setting up debian, that's a bit offtopic here.

[17:48:51] *** Quits: shad (~shad@user/shad) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[17:49:09] <jelly> dinosaure, the netmask to be used depends exclusively on the configuration of the local network where the system is connected to; ask your network admin
[17:49:49] <jelly> if it's a home network then the router will likely be configured to use /24 yes

[17:50:24] *** Zotta_ is now known as Zotta
[17:50:56] <jelly> dinosaure, if your machine got the IP from that same router via DHCP you're going to have a netmask set already, no need to mess with it further
[17:51:12] <Khepra> I was thinking that's DHCP and the network segment is thus assigned. Otehrwise the question should've been about static IP configuration, which is orthogonal to routing through the segment boundary. So maybe the OP wants one, or the other, or maybe both.

[17:54:32] <dinosaure> yeah it's a bit complex, currently I try to develop "unikernel" (mirageos), it's why I talk about "operating system" virtualized with KVM. It seems that one of them can not communicate with outside but I don't really understand why
[17:55:30] <Khepra> dinosaure: and the KVM host is debian?
[17:55:48] *** Joins: Haudegen (~quassel@91.114.49.10)
[17:55:56] <Khepra> which is important, because it defines the next question: how's the VM networking set up.
[17:56:51] *** Quits: adanwan (~adanwan@gateway/tor-sasl/adanwan) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[17:56:53] <dinosaure> yes :)
[17:57:01] <dinosaure> so, Debian 10
[17:57:49] <dinosaure> and then, I have a setup such as a bridge br1 (192.168.1.*) where all of my unikernels communicate (via TAP interface)
[17:58:02] <dinosaure> but, as I said, I don't really understand network things
[17:58:30] <Khepra> does any of the VMs have the networking as expected?
[17:58:35] <dinosaure> currently, I can record some TCP/IP packets on br1 which wants to communiate with internet but they don't go outside br1
[17:58:58] <dinosaure> just one want to communicate with outside - others are fine
[17:59:29] *** Joins: erle- (~stephan@2a04:ee41:3:3297:237b:9ec1:e60a:63d1)
[17:59:40] <Khepra> so none of the other VMs need or have access to the internet, or at least to "outside" of 192.168.1/24?
[18:00:02] <dinosaure> yes exactly
[18:00:13] <Khepra> so no software updates, etc... ?
[18:00:55] <dinosaure> no, mirageos it's like a micro operating system with its own TCP/IP stack
[18:01:35] <dinosaure> and I don't have an access to the unikernel when it was launched (no ssh, etc.)
[18:01:40] <Khepra> my question was actually aiming at figuring out if your host-side networking is properly set up, and if it is, then whatever is problematic inside a VM is specific to that environment
[18:02:03] <Khepra> for example, routing. no default route so packets for, say, 8.8.8.8 dont' know they need to be sent on the specific iface
[18:02:25] <dinosaure> I think this is what happens
[18:03:56] <Khepra> another thing, with bridging, is the question of how you're setting up networking _inside_ the VMs. is it DHCP? Or static IP, in which case do you have a clash with the host, or some other node in the network segment?
[18:04:08] <dinosaure> static IP
[18:04:54] <dinosaure> currently, if my last "unikernel" wants to communicate with outside (via SMTP), it got such packets: https://paste.isomorphis.me/rHC (it's a tcpdump -i br1 port 25)

[20:07:41] <eblip> any ideas
[20:07:59] <mannequin> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOdATLzRGHc
[20:08:13] <somiaj> though personally I don't trust those commands, though I usually avoid just blindly running install scripts as root without better knowing what they are donig. Though you might get better support for this by the writers of the install scripts. To me the output looks strange, but sney maybe correct in you are just missing some dependency
[20:08:30] <somiaj> mannequin: please don't just post youtube links here
[20:08:44] <somiaj> eblip: provide more context, where are you looking for logs?
[20:08:45] <sney> it's odd to need a whole build system like meson for just a theme

[20:09:03] <mannequin> get familiar with them, maybe you'll get a clue
[20:09:05] <eblip> somiaj normally i get a detailed summary
[20:09:16] <somiaj> eblip: so you want to see more output when you boot? Or are you looking at things like /var/log/syslog or using journalctl?

[20:13:40] <tesseract> somiaj: the error report i sent
[20:13:55] <somiaj> tesseract: oh umm, you run some random script as root, who knows what it did. Being a ubuntu theme my guess this isn't built for debian and to nicely play with debian, so there is a chance.
[20:14:13] <somiaj> tesseract: but really you sould be seeking support from the writers of said scripts, as they know what they do.

[20:21:28] <Izem> somiaj: yes very sure
[20:21:28] <somiaj> blackop: no, due to oracle's policy debian cannot support a frozen version of virtualbox for a release.

[20:21:43] <blackop> what does frozen version mean?
[20:21:55] <tesseract> stable i think
[20:22:03] <somiaj> Izem: is the change to 1024x768 happening because you are loading a kms driver? What video card/module are you using?
[20:22:21] <blackop> anyway i need to format the pc
[20:22:30] <somiaj> blackop: frozen means the version will not change, and security issues are backported to the version. Oracle only supports the newest version, debian supports the same version for the 3 year life of a release.

[21:28:08] <blackop> sure
[21:28:21] <shtrb> vbox is REALLY easy to transfer between machines, and it good when there is no exception, if there is an exception in vbox like vmware it will bring your entire windows to a BSOD

[22:02:12] <blackop> ok 2gb for /boot ext4 and 2gb for efi esp
[22:02:12] <greycat> I mean, from each other.  Reading your question again, I'm not sure what you meant.
[22:02:14] <blackop> is that fine?
[22:02:28] <blackop> i am just trying to partition in correct way
[22:02:33] <blackop> with EFI
[22:02:56] <another|> there is no single "correct" way
[22:03:02] <greycat> If you're installing UEFI, you will (must) have an EFI partition.  You don't need a separate /boot, unless there is a specific *reason* for it, such as "I'm doing full disk encryption and the method I'm using requires separate /boot".
[22:03:06] <blackop> proper way*
[22:03:19] <DHE> EFI has to be a vfat partition, but you usually want a "proper" filesystem for /boot with unix permissions, etc. of course, that is just a "want"
[22:03:29] <blackop> greycat: yes i will also do disk encryption with LVM
[22:03:36] <blackop> so i need separated /boot as well

[22:04:10] <another|> you don't neccessarily need a separate /boot

[22:05:30] <tjcarter> DHE: The vfat driver supports many similar/related filesystem formats, but EFI System Partitions are expected to be FAT32.

[22:06:09] <BCMM> if you want a fairly "normal" setup with grub, just have a /boot/ that's distinct from the ESP
[22:06:28] <tjcarter> no, /boot needs to have fairly normal permissions and the like

[22:33:32] <somiaj> Izem: I'm unsure on if that module is kms or not, I kinda think it is, if so all the old framebuffer stuff is outdated as most things are now using kms drivers. Unforuntally I don't have to many more details than that.
[22:33:56] <Izem> thanks for the help
[22:35:21] <somiaj> Izem: though why so specific on the console size? Just courious if you tested dpkg-reconfigure console-setup, though it more gives you options to set fontsize, since most monintors will default to their prefered resolutions done via kms
[22:35:40] <somiaj> You might be able to adjust tings for the vm just configuring console-setup
[22:35:54] <Izem> I need it so that my linux guest can fit in my monitor
[22:36:21] <somiaj> You can try to make the font size smaller, see if that helps, what resolution is it detecting?
[22:36:33] <Izem> 1024x768
[22:36:44] <Izem> console-setup is good when I do it on my host
[22:36:52] <somiaj> I know you can control more of this via kms, I just think there is a lack of documentation on this, mostly because kms usually picks nice resolutions for physical monintors
[22:37:14] <Izem> yeah, from kernel docs the resolution it picked for me seems to be the default
[22:38:29] <somiaj> Izem: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/kernel_mode_setting -- does adding 'drm.edid_firmware=edid/800x600.bin' to your kernel boot parameters help?
[22:39:05] *** Joins: grobi (~grobi@user/grobi)
[22:39:32] <somiaj> also it might be kms is loaded early, and you'll have to add that module to your initramfs, though you'll hvae to adjust arch's wiki to fit debian
[22:39:51] *** Joins: pergaminho (~pergaminh@189.26.121.248)
[22:39:53] <Izem> I doubt it's edid, if so I will have to try later
[22:40:08] <somiaj> you could also just use 'nomodeset' and disable modesetting altogether.

[22:40:24] *** Quits: ax562 (~ax562@user/ax562) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)

[22:41:20] *** Joins: pergaminho (~pergaminh@user/pergaminho)
[22:41:31] <somiaj> anyways, my suggestion is to try to use kms preered methods vs disabling it, but yea kms is not compadaible with all the old framebuffer stuff
[22:41:38] <Izem> I still want to figure out the whole vga and fbcon thing, but that's another adventure

[22:42:12] <Izem> ok, sounds like a plan
[22:42:43] <Izem> so you think debian has a default edid of 1024x768?

[22:44:01] <Izem> thank you very much
[22:44:01] <somiaj> so I odn't know what happens if a monintor doens't provide an edid, that could say default to 1024x768.

[22:46:43] <somiaj> hmm, seems virtualbox the os should be choosing the size, so maybe you are right the 1024x768 is a fallback if no other edid is provided
