[12:42:03] <gour> of course, after fixing it at the mbsync's side, it seems to be ok, but the question arises whether i'd be more happy by deploying getmail instead and keeping old mail on server for a few weeks (for other clients using imap) i order to avoid thise mbsync-related issues

[19:45:31] <bremner> gour_: do you have other clients accessing that maildir? e.g. mutt or ? Moving messages out of new/ happens quite easily with maildirs, and notmuch has no way of knowing.
[19:47:20] <bremner> I guess mbsync might move files if their flags changed on the imap server.

[21:27:25] <bremner> gour_: OK. That sounds like a bug. If you figure out how to reproduce it I'm curious to know about it.
[21:28:03] *** gour_ is now known as gour
[21:30:29] <gour> for other family members i've configured Evolution which i anway need for syncing contacts/calendars, but Evolution uses IMAP and I consider better not play with Evolution/Maildir leaving it for the exclusive use of notmuch
[21:31:27] <bremner> well, your imap syncer is still touching the maildir.
[21:34:20] <gour> yeah. mbsync...that's why i'm thinking about the possibility to use getmail
[21:34:52] <gour> otoh, notmuch is so great - still twaking setup, that i wonder how could i live for so long without it. ðŸ˜•
[21:36:46] <gour> i also notice that systemd service/timer configured as described here https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Isync#Integration_with_notmuch_or_mu4e does not work reliably
[21:38:59] <gour> it's supposed to launch every 16min and although i just checked it's status it reported it was triegger 9min ago, still, manually invoking 'notmuch new' added 20 new messages and detected 9 file renames
[21:39:22] <gour> no idea from where such discrepancy...
[21:45:08] <bremner> did you examine the logs of the mbsync unit?
[21:51:32] * gour is just checking...
