[03:05:21] <expert975> the h-node database says the 3945ABG wifi card does not work with free software. I just tested and it does work.
[03:08:27] <DiffieHellman> As long as you're sure no nonfree firmware is being loaded, feel free to update it.
[03:09:15] <DiffieHellman> Drivers as well actually.
[03:09:39] <expert975> DiffieHellman: I tested on a thinkpad x200 running devuan live and libreboot
[03:10:17] <DiffieHellman> Yeeeah, it looks like the iwl3945 driver is providing nonfree firmware automatically.
[03:11:10] <expert975> DiffieHellman: does that mean debian failed to clean some blob? Will it work with linux-libre?
[03:11:49] <DiffieHellman> It could be that Debian ships with a Linux-libre kernel by default?
[03:12:01] <DiffieHellman> *doesn't ship
[03:12:06] <expert975> DiffieHellman: debian cleans linux instead
[03:13:15] <DiffieHellman> Okay, it looks like "firmware-iwlwifi" is probably installed. Debian seems to ship a cleaned kernel, but not the GNU Linux-libre one.
[03:13:51] <DiffieHellman> No intel Wi-Fi cards work without firmware in fact and no-one has seemingly bothered to write a free replacement (or can't).
[03:14:56] <expert975> DiffieHellman: It is working on a live system. I did not enable the non-free repositories.
[03:16:59] <DiffieHellman> Well unless you can find some free firmware for the 3945ABG, there's a 100% chance that nonfree firmware has been loaded for some reason.
[03:18:33] <tpefreedom> devuan handles blobs/nonfree drivers slightly differently than stock debian.

[03:21:40] <expert975> does not work on Debian or with Linux-libre
[03:22:32] <DiffieHellman> This is why h-node demands that a fully free distro is used for testing, as it's easy to slip up.

[03:24:56] <DiffieHellman> The only distro's that aren't listed in the free software listing, but let you avoid nonfree drivers (without easy mistake) is probably Debian and Gentoo.

[03:54:21] <DiffieHellman> Some SOIC-8 chips are slotted, but pretty much all "modern" motherboards have flatter soldered chips and so the option is ISP (with an external chip) or depending on design, you need to desolder the chip in order to read from it.
[03:55:20] *** Joins: abff (~abff@user/abff)
[03:55:21] <DiffieHellman> Corebooting is hard unless your board is already supported. If not, I recommend dumping your BIOS, running me_cleaner on it and flashing it back as the first step.

[20:54:17] <nomagno> Client-side JS is not necessarily bad as long as it is released under a Free Software license (and preferrably kept unminified), though I definitely do not recommend using a JavaScript framework or similar for static content (it reduces accessibility and compatibility)
[20:55:24] <tpefreedom> unminified?
[20:57:15] <Anton> what difference does minifying client-side js make?
[20:58:59] <nomagno> For performance reasons, big JavaScript chunks will often be minified (Substitute variable names with random letters, remove all whitespace, rearrange logic to increase performance). While there is nothing necessarily wrong with this, I meant more like, if you are going to minify the code at least ensure a link to the unminified file is included
[20:59:33] <nomagno> Because I do not think releasing minified JS under something like the GPL would count as "providing the source code"
[21:00:05] <nomagno> a JS minified is very similar to a compiler
