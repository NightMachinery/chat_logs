[01:23:33] <matsaman> usrnamewastaken: yes, but

[01:23:42] <supas2pid> yes
[01:23:43] <matsaman> usrnamewastaken: you should probably just use a LABEL on the FS, or a UUID

[03:03:52] <NyB> fejj: I'll be honest, at first glance it looks overly complicated. But I've never written a b64 codec in C, so part of that might be dealing with memory - did not really _read_ the code.

[03:04:28] <bitskit> @Tajan it should, technically
[03:04:32] <Tajan> NyB, Debian 11
[03:05:09] <occupant> so our org collects auditd logs and stores them for auditing purposes. we noticed a large percentage of these logs is something that's doing "systemctl --property=MainPID show <servicename>" for every enabled service, every 20 minutes at the 14/34/54 minute mark. this does not correspond to any cron and I have no idea what could be doing this. how could I find out what's executing this?
[03:05:09] <Tajan> what comes to my mind is, even though perhaps the desktop boots properly, some or many programs might fail? can that happen?

[03:53:52] <rascul> depends on what your "system recovery" entails
[03:54:20] <qman__> the method of system recovery I use and am endorsing, is reinstalling, and then restoring data
[03:54:32] <qman__> this is because it's fast, and reliable over the long term

It normally treats every line as a record, and every whitespace delimited element of that line as a field, so you can do $1 to reference field 1.

[13:08:46] <Tajan> hello, my OS (Debian 11) was accidentally borked yesterday, as some people here know. my /bin, /sbin and /usr folders have been deleted. I was told by one member that I could do the fresh install on top of the borked OS, without erasing it fully. I have questions that 1) can I safely do that? or is it better to erase and do all from scratch in this case? 2) if I install on top of the current home folder, does this somehow enable faster restoration of my existing
[13:08:46] <Tajan> setup?

[14:23:25] <WhiteKarura> Greetings everyone! I had a question regarding OSS. I'm pretty new to open source, so I'm not really sure what to expect. Yesterday I uploaded one of my hobby projects onto GitHub as a means of gaining a platform to showcase my code. It was on private visibility for a few hours following which, I made the repository public. I was pretty okay with
[14:23:25] <WhiteKarura> my project being open source, and I also had included an appropriate license to go along with it. However today I noticed that 4 unique users had cloned the repo.
[14:23:26] <WhiteKarura> Coming to think of it, does this mean that they can now just change the name of my project and pass it off as their own? While uploading I hadn't imagined this scenario in which anyone can just rip off my code and upload it on their repo to showcase it (With a change in the name of the project).
[14:23:26] <WhiteKarura> Those who contribute to OSS, how do you deal with this possible plagiarism? Do I make my repository private for the time being, until I'm sure of a future course of action?

[14:36:59] <djph> WhiteKarura: if you want non-commercial?  Probably one of the creative commons ones.  Frankly I don't care enough (or write code that's good enough) to worry beyond the GPL

I have a Samba share on my Debian machine. it's working perfectly as always configured. for external systems to access it. however, i want to rsync one file from the local machine to that share, but of course I get access denied from my own user to it directly.

[20:55:20] <ayecee> smbclient is maybe the quickest way to do that. a cifs mount that your user can access would allow you to use rsync. a gui filemanager may let you use a smb:// url to access it.

[21:27:35] <CaesarNaykid> i noticed the permissions of the rsync'd file are this: -r-xr-xr-x 1 the one that was done with cp is: -rwxr-xr-x 1
[21:27:36] <ayecee> you can try unmounting the samba share to see if that commits the changes. if there's no change, then there's pretty strong evidence that you're not working on the same directory that the client is viewing.
[21:27:59] <CaesarNaykid> rsync was run from the same user though
[21:28:29] <ayecee> cp doesn't copy the permissions, while the typical rsync -a does.

[21:28:48] <DLange> cp -p, does, too
[21:28:48] <ayecee> in any case, the file permissions don't affect whether other users can see it in a directory.
[21:29:33] <CaesarNaykid> yeah, my guess would be my cifs mount isn't working, but then the cp shouldn't have worked

[22:50:13] <peetaur> ok so the mybook thing did the raid? and the dd is separate disks, or the whole virtual device?
[22:50:18] <Boingo> The enclosure I presume...?

[22:52:12] <tonitch> Hey I had a question... I'm following a patch sent to alsa mailing list... but what is the process for it to go in the kernel ? as this is a patch, it is bein reviewed by alsa team but once reviewed where does it go ?

[22:52:59] <ayecee> Boingo: that error is because you created the device file manually, i think.
[22:53:08] <ayecee> Boingo: what is the output from file -s /dev/md4
[22:53:09] <peetaur> after you see assemble fail, you should try mdadm -D to see what it says...maybe it's not really running

[23:52:37] <Helenah> It was Windows.
[23:52:43] <ayecee> ok
[23:52:44] <Helenah> GNU/Linux was lightning speed
[23:52:57] <Helenah> Now to #windows
[23:52:59] <Helenah> Okies
[23:53:24] <Helenah> Or not, appear to be banned. Anyway... have a nice day guys. :)
[23:53:34] * msiism opens a window of opportunity.

[23:56:16] <Helenah> I think I still have problems. lol
[23:56:26] <msiism> Who doesn't?
[23:56:29] <DLange> confirmed
[23:57:13] <Helenah> So I tried booting into an Ubuntu live desktop to test things out, when the process gets past Plymouth the screen turns off and doesn't regain. I appear to have keyboard and mouse control though.

[23:57:42] <Helenah> I might try a different boot option on this, it's just weird.
[23:57:44] <msiism> Maybe getting past Plymouth exhausted the machines power.
[23:58:03] <msiism> I mean, depending from where you start, getting past Plymouth might be quite a journey.
[23:58:04] <Helenah> o.o
[23:59:53] *** Quits: w1r3d (~w1r3d@user/w1r3d) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:59:56] <Helenah> With the "Safe Graphics" boot option I seem to be able to get to the desktop. I'm confused because... unless there has been a surge or something... there is no way 2 graphics cards are broken.
