[21:46:27] <seninha> So, I just created yet another markup language in awk: https://github.com/phillbush/incipit
[21:46:38] <seninha> It converts to html and troff -ms.
[21:59:10] <earnestly> > 100% shell
[21:59:19] <earnestly> :D
[22:03:48] <seninha> the only command called by shell script is awk
[22:04:26] <seninha> (the only non-builtin command, that is)
[22:04:38] <seninha> I wrapped it in a shell script because of shell's getopts builtin.
[22:05:37] <seninha> 95.8% of the shell script is awk.
[22:36:30] <earnestly> I know, it's just amusing to see
