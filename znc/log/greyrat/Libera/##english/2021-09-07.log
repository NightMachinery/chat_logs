[19:00:08] <huf> also, I think you'd need _very_ low octane fuel on the discworld

But there is also the definition provided here "In computer science and networking in particular, a session is a temporary and interactive information interchange between two or more communicating devices, or between a computer and user (see login session)." This definition seems to focus on interactions. The same here: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/session

[23:10:28] <StayHungry> binia: It would be great to meet someone like you to learn about these new technologies beforehand rather than buying a pig in a poke :) indeed, i'm a bit oldschool, used audio-technica w1000, westone um2, tried a few of chi-fi market like revonext and fiio, now i'm looking at etymotic er2xr listed as one of best bargains here https://crinacle.com/rankings/iems/

[23:17:47] <binia> and nice but solid cable with mic for when im out
[23:18:29] <binia> i wont lie, not using them during the summer outside :D

[23:42:49] <braxas> Hi, for a transfer, what would be the opposite of recepient? Originator?
[23:42:53] <braxas> Like for a data transfer
[23:42:58] <braxas> or goods transfer
[23:43:35] <mdogg> I would probably use "host"
[23:44:24] <StayHungry> sender?
[23:44:31] <mdogg> (for data transfers at least)  Host --> Recipient  
[23:44:39] *** Joins: great_taste (~great_tas@190.32.235.15)
[23:44:47] <mdogg> Yeah, "sender" could work too.
