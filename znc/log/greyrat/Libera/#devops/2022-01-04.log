[00:20:52] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: whats the difference between human resource machine and 7 billion humans anyway? they seem terribly similar
[00:22:03] <kwilczynski> The newer one has more distributed tasks as you progress and more comex code is available.
[00:23:07] <rawtaz> ok so its just different challenges

[01:33:24] <kwilczynski> I guess so!
[01:33:38] <kwilczynski> We should get a DevOps Quake 2 server going.
[01:35:50] <Joel> quake one, and I'm in :)
[01:35:51] <rawtaz> oh yeah
[01:36:04] <rawtaz> have you guys seen the Quake Champions theyre working on?
[01:36:14] <rawtaz> its free on steam
[01:36:36] <rawtaz> unfortunately i havent had the rig to play it so meh. im using a pc in the cloud for the little gaming i do. doesnt really work with FPS :>
[01:36:51] <rawtaz> if i had a good fiber it would but i only have 4g
[01:36:54] <rawtaz> are you all on fiber?
[01:37:31] <Joel> windows only for quake champions
[01:37:48] <rawtaz> Joel: back in the quake 1 days i wrote a mod that let you fire the weapons much faster than normal. e.g. you could use the rocket launcher with like one shot per second, and unlimited ammo. that along with some open and nice levels made for an insane amount of fun
[01:37:52] <rawtaz> oh yeah
[01:37:56] <rawtaz> what are you on?
[01:39:11] <Joel> linux.
[01:39:31] <rawtaz> ok

[02:00:52] <gordonjcp> Hi, I'm Gordon, I mash keys randomly on the keyboard and sometimes stuff starts working
[02:01:20] <rawtaz> is it you in that famous gif with someone banging their head on the keyboard?
[02:03:40] <gordonjcp> yeah
[02:04:07] <gordonjcp> also the cat sitting on a laptop with the screen covered in gibberish captioned "lol I have no idea what I'm doing"
[02:04:09] <rawtaz> i wonder how open the traefik peeps are to feature PRs. for example i'd like to have an .enable setting for ipwhitelist middleware so i can turn it on or off
[02:04:21] <rawtaz> hahaha i have that one :D
[02:04:26] <gordonjcp> I'd like ip blacklist middleware

[02:04:33] <rawtaz> also the code review cat is good :)
[02:04:34] <gordonjcp> I'd need to learn Rust
[02:04:44] <rawtaz> oh yeah that would be good too i guess
[02:04:54] <rawtaz> cant you make a PR for it? :)
[02:08:21] <rawtaz> ENOTIME i guess
[02:09:21] <gordonjcp> yeah
[02:09:22] <gordonjcp> it works
[02:09:36] <gordonjcp> if I'm getting hammered by impolite bots I drop an iptables rule in
