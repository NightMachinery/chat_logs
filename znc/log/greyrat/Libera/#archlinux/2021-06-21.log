[00:00:08] <eschwartz> then my message equally applies to s/xorg/wayland/ you nitpicker :p
[00:00:14] <horseface> hha
[00:00:17] <horseface> thanks
[00:00:20] <horseface> okay, brb.
[00:00:25] <eschwartz> you need to restart wayland for env changes to register
[00:01:08] <eschwartz> generally that means either kill it and drop back to a tty login, or return to a display manager and re-do your graphical login
[00:03:35] <pulec> I'm copying data from disks with bad sectors, just using mc and udiskctl to remount the drive when it finally gaves up skip errors

[00:03:56] <pulec> I can check the status if reading is doing okay just by opening a shell, if it's stuck it loads forever
[00:04:46] <pulec> I use alacritty, but I doubt setting there is a setting to avoid "reading something and waiting for the bad drive"
[00:04:51] <pulec> something in the kernel innit?
[00:05:14] <pulec> btw I guess I could use rsync and some --ignore-errors flag for better results
[00:05:53] <pulec> the data is recorded game plays anyways, so reencoding with ffmpeg, it should not matter that byte here or there is missing

[00:20:02] <pulec> Namarrgon: but is ddrescue same as dd in terms of use? can I simply make "ddrescue if=/borked_drive/folder_of_mp4 =of=/safe_place/" ?
[00:20:09] <pulec> or are we thinking images and etc?
[00:20:22] <pulec> s/=of/of
[00:20:31] <Namarrgon> we're talking disk/partition/fs images 
[00:20:41] <Namarrgon> ddrescue handles errors much metter than dd
[00:20:41] <grawity> it *could* be used on files, in theory, but probably not nearly as effectively
[00:20:51] <grawity> it's mostly meant for whole-disk images
[00:20:52] <Namarrgon> you can use it on a single file, yes
[00:21:40] <grawity> (also the syntax is somewhat more regular than dd, it's just `ddrescue /dev/sdb /mnt/rescued.img /mnt/rescued.log`)

[00:21:42] <pulec> single files? and folders? or with glob? /folder/* ?
[00:21:56] <grawity> uh, even regular dd didn't work with folders or globs in the first place
[00:22:05] <pulec> grawity: I like if= and of= it's nice
[00:22:06] <Namarrgon> you have to do the looping yourself
[00:22:18] <pulec> hmmmmmm
[00:22:19] <Namarrgon> which may not work terribly well if the fs/disk is broken

[00:22:57] <pulec> I don't even know what HBA means, but apparently you can connect sf 8482 drives with it
[00:23:13] * pulec was smart enough to just blindly buy cheapest 10tb drive without checking if it's sata3 or not
[00:23:46] <pulec> but luckily tested sas2 hba for 100 euro from germany was avaliable, I don't need to pay 500 euro for new sas3 hba

[00:25:49] <pulec> Namarrgon: it's weird drive btw, from 20 files only one is broken, from 3tb drive I guess only the 2tb are good
[00:26:03] <pulec> I should do backup and wipe to zeros
[00:26:10] <pulec> then check first 2tb and make fs out of that

[03:56:26] <SysGhost>  /etc/fonts/ is the systems default font configuration. Buth those are covered by package "fontconfig" and font packages. ~/.config/fontconfig/ is where the user makes overrides/custom additions.
[03:57:37] <SysGhost> ~/.local/share/fonts/ is where users own font files are stored.
[03:58:06] <Edu4rdSHL> Assuming that the user is using that "fontconfig" thing and not like the DE settings manager, I was just thinking that there would be some utility to dump the current used font configuration no matter how they were set.
[03:58:50] <SysGhost> no utility for it afaik. Just keep a copy of those dirs.
[03:58:50] <Edu4rdSHL> I have retrieved my config already, so it doesn't matter anymore
[03:59:00] <Edu4rdSHL> That dir doesn't exist as well.
[03:59:27] <SysGhost> then some DE's might use their own paths and configs outside the standard "fontconfig". But that's beyond me.
[04:00:44] <SysGhost> KDE uses the standard fontconfig on paths I've given. Not sure how Gnome does it, but I'd assume it does the same.

[05:12:01] <NetSysFire> yes
[05:12:11] <Scimmia> of some sort, yes. If it's UEFI, it can be the stub loader that's already part of the kenrel, but IIRC, VB doesn't save NVRAM entries, so that doesn't work well
[05:13:08] <alzgh> the arch wiki says choose and install a boot loader
[05:13:24] <alzgh> the only one I know is Grub
[05:13:34] <alzgh> should I install grub with pacman?

[05:51:26] <eschwartz> luks2 in grub 2.06 is full of caveats
[05:51:42] <eschwartz> like, it works if /boot/grub is not the thing encrypted by luks!
[05:52:05] <eschwartz> ... or if you do grub-mkimage sorcery, because grub-install doesn't detect luks2 yet
[05:52:15] <johnnyapol> yeah and you you need PBKDF2 to be you key function. no argon support yet :(
[05:53:39] <cyphertite> yep, including the need for the including the correct LUKS2 crypto modules within `grub-install`

[07:54:40] <kulak> I figured `setxkbmap` and its parameters that work for me.  How do I properly configure my session? I use `awesomewm` tiling manager, so I think `.xprofile` might be the best option.  I saw recommendation to use `localectl`, but I don't have it installed and it might not be for arch.

[09:35:51] <mkoskar> I had once an opposite problem, after quite a while I noticed my laptop display wouldn't turn off when I close the lid, heh (btw that caused some backlight burns), turned out that when I replaced palmrest, it was missing piece of magnet that was taped over in original palmrest that is responsible for triggering lid switch when in close proximity
[09:39:57] <mkoskar> i.e., callipygous if you aren't manipulating magnet in front of your laptop's bezel randomly :) then it might be hw issue with your switch or sw quirk as alschaapman observed
