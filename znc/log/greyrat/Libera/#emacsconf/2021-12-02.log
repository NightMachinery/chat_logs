[00:53:13] <Noisytoot> There's a #emacsconf-questions for that
[00:53:24] <Noisytoot> a bot to add questions to the pad could be good
[00:53:34] <Noisytoot> s/ a #/ #/
[00:54:19] <zaeph> We'll work on our IRC-question-grabbing flow next year.
[00:54:51] <zaeph> Etherpad isn't the best solution, but it's held up alright this year and the last.
[00:56:12] <bandali> perhaps we could eventually use crdt.el for the questions
[00:56:35] <bandali> it would also be pretty easy to write a 'bot' (a few functions) with ERC to put questions into that shared emacs buffer
[00:56:55] * zaeph starts sweating.
[00:57:13] <bandali> zaeph, you better get to ironing out the kinks and fixing the bugs in crdt ;)
[00:57:20] * zaeph sweats harder.
[00:59:17] *** Quits: zleap (~zleap@user/zleap) (Quit: Leaving)
[01:04:36] <sachac> we may need to have more volunteers focused on copying questions and answers
[01:04:41] <sachac> it was pretty sparse this year
[01:05:12] <akrl> hi all, the IRC-question-grabbing thing sounds very cool :D
[01:05:17] <zaeph> It's not like we had a scarcity of questions, though.  We didn't really have a protocol for pasting the pad, though.
[01:06:01] <sachac> one of the suggestions was to have talk-specific pads
[01:06:19] <sachac> which will be somewhat easier for speakers to read, and maybe even for us to script
[01:06:37] <ieure> It seemed like most questions were in #emacsconf and there wasn't much happening in #emacsconf-questions.
[01:07:21] <sachac> yeah, we experimented with that this year so that participants didn't have to switch around
[01:07:40] <Sario> Maybe next year have a bot in #emacsconf that tells people to take their questions to the appropriate channel? 
[01:07:49] <sachac> since many questions ended up in #emacsconf anyway last year
[01:08:17] <sachac> and some volunteers scrambled to copy the questions into -questions and the pad
[01:09:38] <sachac> I can add a reminder and a pad link in the talk announcement
[01:10:04] <sachac> but some people don't have the pad open or don't do JS, so we may still need someone focused on keeping an eye on IRC
[01:10:06] <bandali> we should definitely experiment with a bot in here next year
[01:11:24] <bandali> i've seen some other conferences have bots that collect and forward questions for a talk either to the host or to the speaker themselves
[01:13:19] <sachac> maybe if we got better at collecting IRC nicks
[01:13:27] <sachac> then people can mention them directly
[01:14:31] <sachac> my ideal would probably be to have a volunteer stick with the speaker throughout the Q&A session
[01:16:00] <sachac> with some shortcuts to copy the current IRC line for easier pasting into the pad
[01:16:16] <sachac> and maybe capturing the timestamp and making sure the question gets recorded
[01:16:55] <sachac> I plan to sort through the IRC logs later and make sure all the questions get copied to the pad
[01:17:02] <sachac> and then from the pad to the talk pages
[01:17:18] <sachac> and then to emails to the speakers
[01:19:32] <sachac> probably my fault. :) I encouraged people to post their questions on IRC or on the pad, but I didn't make sure we had volunteers focused on copying back and forth
[01:19:50] <Noisytoot> Have an IRC bot generate a web page with questions when questions are asked.
[01:19:55] <zaeph> You're fine~.  Collective responsibility. :o)
[01:21:16] <Noisytoot> Does fsbot have any network access?
[01:22:01] <sachac> and actually speakers ended up looking at IRC, the pad, *and* BBB chat, the poor dears
[01:23:41] <sachac> similarly, we now have all these places to look as we collect the questions

[01:29:12] <sachac> pad for every talk might be able to reduce the friction
[01:29:19] <sachac> since people won't need to scroll or find
[01:29:32] <opalvaults> akrl: we'll figure out how to keep you in the loop. you can also ask questions to the organizers directly at #emacsconf-org.  :)
[01:29:55] <sachac> but it's still JS and somewhat annoying
[01:30:55] <sachac> bot would be nice, whether the collected questions are manually copied to the pad or we work out something fancy
[01:31:17] <bandali> crdt also seems like could be a natural fit here, avoiding js and the annoyances of browsers/web
[01:31:42] <sachac> the pad can easily be exported to HTML from the command line (or Emacs :) ), so it's possible to write something that grabs the pad and the collected questions, merges them, and posts them
[01:31:56] <sachac> somewhere with an autorefresh so the speaker can look at just that
[01:32:22] <zaeph> We can definitely script that.
[01:32:28] <sachac> well, just that + BBB
[01:33:49] <Noisytoot> sachac, a bot that just generates HTML doesn't need JS
[01:34:24] <sachac> Noisytoot: yup. we can't easily write to the pad, I think, but we can generate a static nonJS page
[01:34:35] <sachac> that has data from both IRC and the pad
[01:35:32] <sachac> would anyone like to try coding such a thing?
[01:38:26] <zaeph> ðŸ¦—ðŸ¦—
[01:38:36] <zaeph> (Those are crickets.)
[01:39:02] <sachac> I might do it eventually, as I was planning to bot up my ERC anyway
[01:39:03] <zaeph> I might give it a shot next year.
[01:39:18] <zaeph> You said it first. ;p
[01:40:10] <sachac> there's probably a simpler solution
[01:42:29] <sachac> Also, last year, we did pretty much everything on the main stream
[01:42:40] <sachac> except for wasamasa's extended presentation
[01:43:00] <zaeph> Oh, I think that's a very good point; it does explain a lot of the snags that we ran into this year with the distribution of questions.
[01:43:41] <zaeph> I still think we could have centralised the questions for the stuff that was on main.webm, but all things considered, we performed similarly as last year on that front.
[01:44:07] <sachac> so that's probably a big part of why everything was a little crazy :)
[01:45:05] <sachac> having two formalized streams and one IRC room per stream may help, but it needs more volunteers
[01:45:50] <sachac> IRC breaks down when sessions overlap on the same channel
[01:46:57] <sachac> but some of the conversations went on much longer than they would have been allocated even in a two-stream schedule, and that's great
[01:47:30] <zaeph> It was definitely awesome for those who were in the room, and all the personalised discussions that arose from this. :)
[01:47:41] <zaeph> Now, all we gotta do is figure out a good way to publish all this so that other may benefit from it.
[01:47:44] <zaeph> s/other/others/
[01:48:31] <sachac> so maybe talk pads + IRC bot + Q-talkslug: convention + HTML page merging the info
[01:48:35] <sachac> might be a good experiment
[01:49:21] <sachac> and if I control my browser from Emacs or wherever the bot is, I might be able to inject it into BBB chat
[01:49:22] <zaeph> â€¦And, if we don't do it automatically, we can probably get a volunteer to do it, otwo volunteers for two streams.
[01:49:30] <zaeph> s/otwo/or two/
[01:49:38] <sachac> or the pad, very carefully
[01:50:48] <sachac> so about that Nyxt thing... :)
[01:50:58] <zaeph> Heh~.
[01:55:36] <sachac> okay. so last year we had mostly everything on the main stream and the host read out some questions or shared the pad, making it prominent
[01:56:28] <sachac> this year we tried packing as much as possible into the schedule, which means we had the Q&A on an alternate stream
[01:56:44] <sachac> and sometimes even had two going at a time
[01:57:34] <sachac> sometimes we could have a volunteer hang out in the Q&A room, but sometimes not

[01:59:42] <sachac> we can see if bot + pads + merging will help next year, and we can also experiment with multiple streams if there are enough people to pull it off
[02:00:35] <sachac> so that speakers don't feel like they've just been dropped in a room and left to their own devices :)
[02:01:02] <sachac> and people don't worry that their question will fall through the cracks
[02:01:15] <sachac> reasonable summary to add to the conference notes?
[02:01:27] <zaeph> Yup!
[02:02:08] <zaeph> I'll also try to think about it in the braindump that I'll write tomorrow, and we can reconcile it with your notes afterwards.
