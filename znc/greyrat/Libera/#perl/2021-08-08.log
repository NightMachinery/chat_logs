[00:18:12] <furrymcgee> mst: ether need to save the list for future uses, so they might use some kind of local list
[00:22:24] <mst> furrymcgee: right, but 'local' works perfectly fine
[00:22:40] <mst> furrymcgee: the -only- thing that went wrong was that you misread the shift() documentation and which array it defaults to operating on
[00:23:10] <mst> furrymcgee: @_ is subroutine arguments, so it only makes sense inside a subroutine. @ARGV is script arguments, so it's the default outside of a subroutine in a script (just like in bash)

[00:28:23] <Grinnz> the conflation of shift @_ with shift @ARGV largely stems from perl's heritage as a bash replacement
[00:29:35] <furrymcgee> with local you dont really need any other variables than %_, @_, $_

[00:32:48] <mst> furrymcgee: I did once make a script whose sole variable was @_ and made all of its subroutine calls with &foo(); to pass the @_ down

[09:10:05] <gordonfish-> Well, I can honestly say that NBC in the US has got to be one of the worst broadcasters of the Olympics. Many times not even showing standings after events, interupting events mid stream to run another barage of commercials, mis-spelling names (even of Americans), annoying commentary that often had nothing to do with what was going on + getting many facts wrong, fouls/challenges being called but showing random highlights instead of an instant replay o

[09:12:22] <gordonfish-> And the NBC Olympics 
[09:14:26] <gordonfish-> And the NBC Olympics app on smart TVs / devices, which is really just the app for NBC sports, is a complete disaster. In 2016, it had categories and a decent layout, this time it was a big jumbled mess, and it constantly had audio/video sync issues (no other streaming app I've used on that TV has that problem), and half of them wouldn't play, constant errors.
[09:16:34] <gordonfish-> NBC really shouldn't be allowed to carry the olympics anymore, or at least shouldn't be the only one in the US, it should be open to two or more, as the lack of competition has really allowed the quality to be dragged down hard.

[09:26:23] <xenu> because it may hurt them in long term
[09:27:09] <gordonfish> I thought that maybe the IOC wouldn't look kindly to a broadcaster screwing up so much, that maybe it violates some agreement or something that outlines minimum quality/effort/etc, so it could be some sort of breach of terms if that was the case. But NBC has tremdously deep pockets, so...
[09:27:44] <rbraun> the IOC <3 comcast
[09:27:57] <rbraun> and in europe, eurosport (which has the spillover/cable rights now)
[09:28:19] <rbraun> at least in europe most countries have the public broadcaster with the first-line rights
[09:28:59] <gordonfish> I honestly would think that if it was really brought to the IOC or who ever it would concern's attention of how badly it was done this time around, that it actually make them rethink things, that the Olympics aren't being properly represented.

[09:29:32] <haarg> the olympics is entirely about extracting money from any source it can
[09:29:38] <gordonfish> rbraun: Wow, in what way to host cities get shafted?
[09:29:41] <rbraun> yeah
[09:29:54] <rbraun> gordonfish: well you can start with montreal that went bankrupt after '76, or maybe quebec did
[09:29:55] <gordonfish> I mean in terms of broadcasting
[09:30:17] <haarg> the olympics is ruinous to every city that hosts it
[09:30:25] <gordonfish> I know they spend a f-ton of money on getting everything built, et al
[09:30:29] <xenu> UEFA for example forbids broadcasters from interrupting their streams
[09:30:38] <xenu> they must be shown live
[09:30:41] <rbraun> around that time, denver refused the winter olympics for the first time
[09:31:00] <haarg> it's not just the money - it's also the destruction of the existing city
[09:31:05] <rbraun> xenu: see, in 'merica, our "football" is designed to have frequent interruptions, and the rules have made them longer over the years
[09:31:10] <gordonfish> xenu: Sounds good, though in fairness, it's hard to show everything live from the other side of the world, but I agree 100% about interuptions
[09:31:12] <haarg> and the excess policing
[09:31:23] <rbraun> which is okay in a way, it's more like a track meet than a marathon compared to soccer, but the commercial impetus behind it is obvious
[09:31:37] <gordonfish> rbraun: Yeah the super bowl is a prime example
[09:31:53] <rbraun> it's an advertising exhibition with sports intermissions
[09:32:11] <gordonfish> heh, pretty much
[09:32:20] <rbraun> now for '28, the left wing in los angeles is pointing out the obvious that's going to happen
[09:32:32] <rbraun> but since it's the DSA and all doing it, "NOlympics" doesn't have much broad base support
[09:33:06] <rbraun> in denver they actually got business on board (partly because everyone knows what a disaster it will be if tax money supports it there; colorado has an unusual constitutional requirement regarding taxes that makes their finances very brittle)
[09:33:12] <gordonfish> Doesn't LA already have an olympic stadium/village? Or are they going to rebuild everything?
[09:33:26] <rbraun> and NOlympics Denver ended up being a coalition from the socialists to business suit-and-tie types
[09:33:33] <rbraun> so they rejected it for the second time
[09:33:49] <rbraun> gordonfish: IOC will probably demand they gut it and rebuild all but the skeleton
[09:34:04] <gordonfish> ug
[09:34:19] <gordonfish> That's be rather wasteful
[09:34:41] <gordonfish> I'm sure at least some of the facilities were updated over the last few decades
[09:34:48] <rbraun> i mean i assume it will be enormously wasteful, yes
[09:34:51] <rbraun> it always is
[09:35:32] <rbraun> there's athens where they took a break from using euro funny money to pay for unnecessary defense crap (often bought from germany, which is why the greeks were especially mad when germany wanted austerity later on)
[09:35:43] <rbraun> to build stadiums half of which are falling down now
[09:36:10] <rbraun> beijing had deep pockets and so did london, but might have distracted david cameron from his country falling into a pit that later resulted in them ejecting full speed from the EU
[09:36:27] <rbraun> rio was a nightmare and barely got built, iirc
[09:36:45] <gordonfish> In rio they couldn't even keep the water in the pools from turing green
[09:36:48] <rbraun> the winter games are usually not quite as bad in terms of the waste but sochi was basically a potemkin village
[09:36:54] <rbraun> yep
[09:37:55] <gordonfish> ugh, sochi, russians abused the hell out of it too
[09:37:59] <rbraun> well
[09:38:03] <gordonfish> (and got caught)
[09:38:12] <rbraun> they remembered to wait until *after* the olympics to invade anywhere this time, unlike in 1980
[09:38:20] <gordonfish> Heh
[09:38:22] <rbraun> and pretty much did it right on cue too
[09:38:33] <rbraun> like the ukraine shit went down within a month after
[09:39:13] <rbraun> haarg: yeah apparently some people got evicted in tokyo who also got evicted for the *last* olympics in 196?
[09:39:23] <rbraun> 1964
[09:39:31] <gordonfish> wtf
[09:39:42] <rbraun> i also can't imagine how bad the excess policing will be in LA, given how american police already usually are

[15:27:27] <ens> what is this obsession that all the job offers have with using bash scripting to maintain their systems.
[15:27:35] <ens> for a sysadmin job: "as the client has a Linux OS and so Bash scripting skills will be crucial for this role."
[15:28:05] <ens> have we not gone any further than bash scripting since the 90s or whatever
[15:30:46] <mst> ens: even if you're not using it for any sort of primary maintenance, bash scripting for oddities and ad-hoc changes is pretty common
[15:36:09] <xenu> be thankful it's not csh scripting
[15:42:53] <mst> xenu: *ARGH*
[15:46:22] <Altreus> yeah but "crucial"?

[15:56:18] <ens> it reminds me of coding in mirc script.
[16:06:28] <tm604> "bash scripting" is also used as a shorthand for "basic commandline familiarity"

[19:30:10] <huf> and nobody was happy about any of it
