[01:12:45] <hesco> I have the images working reliably, except that they keep being forced onto the next page dissociated from the photo credit.  Any way to resolve that?

[01:40:46] <__monty__> hesco: I think both these issues can't be resolved from the source format.
[01:40:53] <__monty__> You'll have to change the latex template.
[01:41:32] <__monty__> There's probably a package you can add that'll make the hyperlinks work.
[01:41:48] <__monty__> For the images you'd have to force them not to be floats.
[01:42:29] <__monty__> Maybe there's a package that does so but it might also require a custom filter where you turn the images into a custom latex command.
[01:42:42] <__monty__> Have you tried going straight from the html?
[01:52:00] <__monty__> Good luck, be back tomorrow.

[02:37:39] <hesco> thanks __monty__.  I will copy these notes aside for further investigation after a nap.  Appreciate you taking a look at this!

[21:58:15] <cheeseboy> I'm trying to conver a media wiki to gh using https://github.com/outofcontrol/mediawiki-to-gfm
[21:58:30] <cheeseboy> but I get
[21:58:31] <cheeseboy> Error at "source" (line 155, column 1):
[21:58:31] <cheeseboy> unexpected end of input
[21:58:31] <cheeseboy> expecting lf new-line, "|+", "|-", "!", "<", "|" or "|}"
[21:58:31] <cheeseboy> ^
[21:58:31] <cheeseboy> Pandoc could not convert successfully, error code: 65. Tried to run the following command: /usr/bin/pandoc --from=mediawiki --to=gfm /tmp/pandoc610ec1d298a3d
[22:00:06] <cheeseboy> any ideas on how I can fix this?
[22:10:46] <__monty__> First thing's to check the syntax of the input really carefully.
