[00:52:43] <d1> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many 
[00:52:43] <d1> computer use version of the GNU system every day, without ...
[00:52:44] <d1> ... realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program allocates the machine’s resources to 
[00:52:44] <d1> the other programs that you run. The kernel is an ...
[00:52:44] <d1> ... essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU//Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.

[09:18:20] <xe0n> rookie mistake, dont ever give up your last beer
[09:18:21] <xe0n> :P
[09:18:52] <fritzwastaken> I said its the last in my sixer, not my last beer!
[09:18:58] <xe0n> LOL
[09:18:58] <xe0n> NICE
[09:19:03] <xe0n> you buy a case?
[09:19:12] <fritzwastaken> I bought a fridge
[09:19:33] <fritzwastaken> not actually.. I bought a case
[09:19:33] <technonerd> how many cases does it fit?
[09:19:40] <fritzwastaken> lol
[09:20:22] <fritzwastaken> buyin from the local brewers is so much cheaper than the shops
[09:20:24] <xe0n> is that the standard measurement of a fridge, how many cases does it hold
[09:20:30] <xe0n> i guess if it's primary use is as a beer fridge
[09:20:30] <xe0n> lol
[09:20:45] <xe0n> fritz: really?
[09:20:49] <xe0n> is it craft beer?
[09:20:59] <xe0n> the ones around here are all craft, so they're more
[09:20:59] <xe0n> lol
[09:21:09] <fritzwastaken> ive seen "garage fridges" etc by how many bottles or cans they can hold
[09:21:35] <xe0n> and all the hipster breweries around here do the 4 can packs instead of sixer
[09:21:42] <xe0n> but the % is more
[09:21:50] <xe0n> local one here, i drink of their cans and its gone straight to my head
[09:21:58] <technonerd> a growler is 4 drinks and some change
[09:22:03] <technonerd> 1 extra gulp
[09:22:06] <xe0n> good ol growler
[09:22:07] <fritzwastaken> My state has really weird beer laws, bringing them a growler to fill passes like 2 different taxes and resale increases
[09:22:08] <xe0n> i should get mine filled
[09:22:24] <xe0n> yeah growler for us i think is like $18 at the local brewery enix and i go too
[09:22:28] <fritzwastaken> saves a ton of money
[09:22:28] <technonerd> weird, im the king of weird
[09:22:46] <technonerd> breweries can only sell so much beer on tap
[09:24:11] <technonerd> "Minnesota breweries were not allowed to serve pints of their beer on site because of a "three-tier" system that strictly separated the roles of alcohol manufacturers, distributors and retailers."
[09:24:23] <xe0n> LOl
[09:24:26] <xe0n> pints ftw
[09:24:35] <fritzwastaken> A very wise man once gave me a bit of advice. Im about to take it. Good night everyone!  @JollyRgrs | fritzwastaken: go home, you're drunk

[09:38:09] <csws> lol. no
[09:38:20] <csws> you can have multiple TXT records on a single domain

[10:30:15] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> sure. but wouldn't you as a sysadmin ask why more space was always needed?
[10:30:34] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> and review your WSUS/patching?
[10:33:57] <catbeard> depends on who has the company purse for handling all potential ramifications of disabling legacy updates, if it's just a matter of deselecting OS to provide updates to, and cleaning up the unused files then you should tell your chain of command that
[10:34:47] <csws> yeah but catbeard it seems like he just thought the WSUS baseline was 3TB and didn't even realise there were old approvals lol
[10:35:01] <csws> just total ignorance
[10:35:10] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> It's just been set to automatic approval for so long, I doubt that my coworkers knew that itanium updates, etc were being approved
[10:35:26] <csws> nice

[10:35:59] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> Definitely not malicious, just more "I don't know why it takes so much space"
[10:36:16] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> is like "wait, how do you not"
[10:36:20] <catbeard> "there's why" should be your answer to your chain of command

[10:37:34] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> Yeah, that doesn't work. that just makes people despise me
[10:38:06] <catbeard> just be like by the way i cleared 300GB and fixed the disk issue on WSUS, turns out we had updates nobody uses enabled
[10:38:36] <catbeard> and make a note of what settings were changed, and backups of the updates for whatever purposes they need
[10:39:13] <sd> 13<S​hocklance> Yeah. These are disabled, but since it's already been "approved" WSUS doesn't take those changes to products and unapprove patches
[10:39:17] <csws> ha
[10:39:17] <csws> backups
[10:39:53] <catbeard> then you might suggest a fix for that before waltzing in mad about it
[10:40:11] <catbeard> so you can present both the problem, your work, and the solution to fix it for good

[23:03:06] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> he neds to shut down the VM and wait for it to be evac'd off the machine
[23:03:08] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> to really push it
[23:03:16] <sd> 11<M​isterrguy> thats what i would assume is happening too, but he mentioned an API and i'm not familiar so
[23:03:28] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> He's using the standard google drive desktop client
[23:03:33] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> which is supposed to "Stream" the files from gdrive
[23:03:38] <sd> 11<M​isterrguy> ah , yup then thats whats happening
[23:03:42] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> but it can't do that until the files are actually in gdrive
[23:03:53] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> it's not supposed to store any files locally unless you force it to or something
[23:04:08] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> but like i said, until it's actually fully uploaded and off the machine, it's still local usage

[23:05:09] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> your point?
[23:05:09] <CableNinja> @Noob, theres local caching going on so that you can write to it without the google drive or your system getting pissed
[23:05:11] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> google drive's file stream cache is local
[23:05:29] <sd> 14<N​oob> but yes, core parts of the OS running off ram, and caching is what probably is not having it rate limit

[23:06:30] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> the entire VM disk is in cache right now lol
[23:07:00] <sd> 14<N​oob> The true test would be running it off a larger datastore on a small system. E.G. a 50gb drive for host OS running workstation pro, then try to run a 100gb windows server VM off Google Drive. Then see how it goes without caching
[23:07:25] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> or just close your VM software, wait a day or two for it to upload, then clear cache and boot the VM
[23:07:40] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> that'd also be a valid test, at least of remote access - VM will start slow and gradually speed up as parts are cache
[23:07:46] <sd> 14<N​oob> Really I just want to see how far you can go before it fails
[23:07:58] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> well, when you're running still off pure local storage, you're gonna be fine
[23:08:08] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> even with the Win VM, it'll still get boosts from the most used parts being cached locally most of the time, even if it's only 10GB of it
[23:08:15] <sd> 14<N​oob> I can try booting the VM on a different machine entirely. I have a win 10 VM on a dedi I can try running it off of.
[23:08:20] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> yea
[23:08:24] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> *that* would be a valid test
[23:08:34] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> IF the disk is accessible in google drive yet (it may not be depending on your upload bandwidth)
