[16:53:03] <re101-toucan-43> problem solved - thank you :)
[16:53:41] <digitok> nice :) the docs also mention a tokenize function
[16:53:55] <digitok> not sure if you could use that instead or not
[16:54:22] <digitok> "(...) Parenthesis create a marked group of the expression. The tokenize mode allows you to match a larger part of the input field, yet only return a subset that was marked. This way you avoid returning the delimiter. You may only have 1 marked expression."
[16:54:37] <digitok> so the regex i provided would return the part you want
[16:55:08] <digitok> althought if you couldn't use the regex you started with, that probably doesn't help :)
[16:55:13] <digitok> ignore me
[16:55:19] <digitok> although*
[16:55:29] <re101-toucan-43> This is what I finished with

[16:55:33] <re101-toucan-43> and that works
[16:56:04] <digitok> ah, you probably don't need the Replace() part
[16:56:13] <digitok> REGEX_Replace([#1],".*?(\w+)=True.*",'$1')
[16:56:21] <digitok> see if that works
[16:56:22] <re101-toucan-43> i'll try

[18:53:12] <Jo5eph> Thanks for looking into this purplex..much appreciated.
[19:02:07] <purplex> As i suspected its because notepad is using \r\n as linefeed
[19:03:48] <purplex> if it change it to \n then it works

[19:29:26] <digitok> wb 
[19:39:06] <Jo53ph> Hi, so this regex wasn't working in Notepad++, i posted this earlier and perlbot recommended that i replace the \r (CR) with \n (NL) in np++ and suggestion worked. However, how should i change my regex so that it work with \r in np++
[19:39:58] <Jo53ph> sorry i meant purplex not perlbot
[19:41:32] <digitok> what newlines is your file using
[19:41:54] <digitok> \r\n?
[19:42:54] <Jo53ph> file is using \r
[19:43:26] <Jo53ph> changed this to \n and regex worked
[19:43:42] <Jo53ph> want to know how to get regex to work with \r
[19:44:08] <digitok> if the file is using \r, i'm not sure why it wouldn't work 
[19:45:41] <purplex> if file is using \r then is notepad++ is replacing it with \r\n ?
[19:48:16] <digitok> even then, i'd expect [^\r|] to work 
[19:49:31] <purplex> also regex101 is using \n always, it doesn't know of it at all
[19:49:37] <digitok> i'd only expect it to not work if the file was using \n
[19:49:46] <digitok> yep 
[19:51:25] <purplex> but hes right it doesn't work with \r i tested it in software by changing \n to just \r
[19:52:11] <Jo53ph> Np++ has the eol as \r (i set it as this as in the messaging file standard the file is configured, eol is always \r)
[19:52:27] <Jo53ph>  but i see that the regex will only with \n as i have it now. Is there a way to get the regex to work with \r

[19:57:27] <digitok> i'm not sure why that would even work tbh
[20:02:32] <Jo53ph> no worries. if there isn't a way, i will make do with switching \r with \n and then running the regex.:] 
[20:03:16] <digitok> seems like a np++ issue
[20:04:38] <digitok> can you test something
[20:07:33] <Jo53ph> sure..let me know what i need to do
[20:07:46] <digitok> can you see if 14.* matches each line individually
[20:08:08] <digitok> (with \r)
[20:08:46] <digitok> also, to clarify, the link you posted should have no matches?

[20:12:44] <Jo53ph> sorry i am quite new to regex and so don't understand what you're asking me to do exactly. The link should match and at present it matches 2 times
[20:14:42] <digitok> oh so you want it to match through \n

[20:15:31] <Jo53ph> Yes, in regex101 it matches through \n, but i need it to match through \r in np++
[20:16:54] <digitok> does your np++ file contain any \n at all?
[20:17:19] <Jo53ph> no, it doesn't have \n. it only has \r
[20:17:37] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/i0ZEAm/2
[20:17:46] <digitok> see if this works
[20:17:48] <purplex> i was testing it on \r\n

[20:18:25] <purplex> left me purplexed lol
[20:18:32] <digitok> i thought the whole issue was not wanting it to match across lines
[20:18:37] <digitok> seems not
[20:18:52] <digitok> in which case /2 should worj
[20:18:54] <digitok> work*
[20:20:32] <Jo53ph> If accross lines, you mean that after the line that matches PV1 i need to continue to the next line to match, yes, i need to have the regex match across lines.
[20:21:08] <digitok> yep
[20:21:52] <Jo53ph> by /2 can you elaborate, what this means, as i don't follow what it means.
[20:22:16] <digitok> /2 is the link i posted
[20:22:25] <digitok> version 2 of your link
[20:22:52] <Jo53ph> '=D  ok, will take a look.
[20:22:57] <digitok> :)
[20:23:35] <digitok> 14[^\r|] matches a character that is NOT 14\r or 14|
[20:23:57] <digitok> meaning it won't match across lines or through 14|
[20:24:32] <digitok> so i'm pretty sure you just want  [^|]
[20:25:58] <Jo53ph> Excellent =D , that worked in np++ with /r as the eol.
[20:26:08] <digitok> perfect :)

[20:28:54] <Jo53ph> Thanks...this is really helpful. The file is based on the HL7 standard, a messaging standard in healthcare, i will be posting this in regex101 publicly for anyone who needs find messages that match values in multiple segment, each segment end with eol
[20:30:56] <purplex> ok it was interesting regex, way how 31 refers to 31 | regardless of anything else in between..
[20:31:23] <digitok> nice :)
[20:33:49] <Jo53ph> each | delimits a field in a segment, each eol delimits a segment. Each segment start with 3 letters that indicate a particular type of segment.. A group of segments make a single message. So the 31 | was a way to get to the field i required to match on the next segment. Hope this makes sens. if not no worries,
[20:35:29] <Jo53ph> I am very grateful for your help. Searching for messages is routine part of my work and i just started using regex as it is really useful searching for specific messages by matching.
[20:36:01] <Jo53ph> take care and stay safe. thanks again. :] 
[20:36:08] <digitok> yep, i understand :)
[20:36:12] <digitok> you too
