[00:49:39] <alystair> hmmmm I was hoping of something more straight forward to know if I should be doing background pulls for additional data that improve UX but can be ignored if they have a limited connection

[00:51:11] <Alexendoo> I'd be inclined to say make sure you test that actually works
[00:51:16] <Alexendoo> But also yeah poor support
[00:51:38] <Alexendoo> Since I think "data saving mode" is some chrome feature, rather than corresponding to having a bandwidth cap

[03:20:54] <ThePendulum> although I guess it might work

[03:24:08] <lantech19446> the people who are in it have basically told me if my portfolio isn't amazing and I'm not specialized in something I won't get in they're not saying there's no jobs
[03:25:41] <jaawerth> hmm I've always been a generalist and haven't found it to be an issue but it might depend on what they mean by "specialize"
[03:26:16] <lantech19446> I took it to mean I need to have something i'm really good in above and beyond the other levels
[03:26:16] <jaawerth> as a developer though I always avoid boxes like "webdev" or "frontend dev" because it's all just software to me
[03:26:48] *** Joins: biberu (~biberu@user/biberu)
[03:26:57] <jaawerth> but like, if you just do plain DOM + js + css + html, sure, lots of folks need devs whocan do rect et al, which some people might count as a specialization and others might not
[03:27:25] <jaawerth> sometimes "webdev" is closer to what I might consider to be more of a designer, too, if it's just around making web pages
[03:28:05] <lantech19446> oh yea that was the other thing they told me that a job just designing web pages doesn't really exist anymore.

[14:10:11] <n00b101> My friend said that I need js events. Tbh idk js. Are there better, easy approaches?
[14:11:58] <Decker> https://codemirror.net/ n00b101 this seems more like what you'd want
[14:13:18] <n00b101> What's this.. I think you misunderstood the question ❓
[14:13:38] <Decker> you have a thing that has text, and you select a position in it - sounds exactly like what an editor does.
[14:13:45] <Decker> and return line/col/char of selection
[14:14:23] <n00b101> Yes
[14:14:46] <Decker> so what's not understood?
[14:14:48] <Decker> afk a few

[18:28:22] <diophantoz> var listElement refers to a chain of a getElementById, querySelector and finally querySelectorAll.
[18:29:47] <diophantoz> if i console log listElement i get a nodelist, if i do listElement[0] i get the first node in the list etc
[18:30:53] <stagas> maybe try doing Array.from(listElement) as NodeList isn't an actual array so there might be some problem there

[23:13:10] <sheetjs> right, but the fact that open source organizations were on the list is evidence of at least two factors

[23:13:38] <obimod> yea that's misguided for sure

[23:49:29] <obimod> i'm not familiar with GPL vs AGPL - can AGPL be used in commercial software under certain conditions?
[23:50:15] <sheetjs> the main difference between GPL and AGPL is the "user"
[23:51:12] <sheetjs> say a nodejs server project.  the user is the person or company that is running the server project, not the end user that interacts with the server
[23:51:36] <sheetjs> AGPL extends "user" to include the end users interacting with the server
[23:51:42] <obimod> gotchya - makes sense
[23:53:36] <ljharb> sheetjs: sure, lawyers can disagree

[23:54:26] <ljharb> sheetjs: but since the lawyers at many major companies decided it was fine to use react with that license, and the ASF isn't accepting actual monetary risk by agreeing with it, they get to disagree with it on philosophical grounds solely to make a name for themselves
[23:54:34] <ljharb> their interpretation still isn't objective truth
[23:54:46] <sheetjs> neither interpretation is objective truth
[23:54:51] <sheetjs> hence the obsession with the concept of trust
[23:55:18] <sheetjs> open source is all about trust, trusting the developers and the processes
[23:55:50] <sheetjs> even if facebook did relicense a second time to MIT, it is not forgotten that they broke the trust in the first place by moving from apache to something very nonstandard
[23:56:31] <ljharb> sure it is
[23:56:38] <sheetjs> and you and your projects directly benefit from that ljharb
[23:56:42] <ljharb> if they'd initially released with the nonstandard license the effect and pushback would have been the same
[23:56:48] <sheetjs> no
[23:56:50] <ljharb> yes
[23:56:53] <ljharb> sheetjs: directly benefit from what?
[23:56:54] *** Quits: stewie925 (~stewie925@2600:1702:44f0:35c0:fcbc:82d8:6a9b:bafd) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[23:57:18] <sheetjs> if they initially released with the nonstandard license and relicensed, the story would have been a lot better but they wouldn't have achieved the same level of adoption
[23:57:18] <ljharb> sheetjs: the pushback was because they HAD a project with a nonstandard license, not because they changed to it.
[23:57:26] <ljharb> i think they would have
[23:57:43] <teut> https://bpa.st/J5TA#1L11  need some help with design principles  , so this class takes various arguments in the constructor and a dataframe (danfo.js)  and gives statistics based on gender and age group which are two columns in the dataframe
[23:57:45] *** Joins: trevors (~trevors@c-65-96-171-157.hsd1.ma.comcast.net)
[23:58:20] <teut> now If I need to compute the total of all genders then I cant do it with this class
[23:58:29] <ljharb> sheetjs: but also, it's only a trust issue if they did it that way *on purpose* which clearly isn't the case
[23:58:59] <sheetjs> it was clearly done on purpose tho.  the default situation was the original apache 2 license
[23:59:01] <ljharb> sheetjs: facebook decided "suddenly" that they wanted to prevent patent trolls - presumably they were sued by a bunch over a short period of time - and made the change
[23:59:13] <ljharb> sheetjs: it was done to stop patent trolls. it wasn't planned when they initially released.
[23:59:18] <sheetjs> right but that's the problem
[23:59:26] <ljharb> what's the problem
[23:59:27] <sheetjs> not "patent trolls" per se but weaponizing the project
[23:59:36] <sheetjs> they weren't hit by patent trolls on react patents
[23:59:38] <ljharb> sure
[23:59:44] <sheetjs> or patents adjacent to react
[23:59:47] <ljharb> i agree
[23:59:53] <ljharb> it was sort of a "scorched earth" approach
[23:59:56] <sheetjs> they were *unrelated* patents and they decided to use react as a cosh
