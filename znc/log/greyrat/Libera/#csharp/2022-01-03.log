[12:09:59] <jmer> I am not that expereinced with tests but it seems kinda weird that they only fail in certain periods of the year.
[12:09:59] <Nasp> I would say so as well
[12:10:12] <jmer> What test even makes sense to be OK to fail in certain periods of the year?
[12:10:37] <biberu> are people referencing DateTime directly? 😱
[12:11:23] <jmer> biberu: How else are you supposed to use a DateTime type?
[12:12:39] <biberu> jmer: e.g. by using an interface instead, then you just swap it out for something deterministic while testing
[12:12:57] <Nasp> Do you mean DAteTime.now?
[12:12:57] <jmer> biberu: Aah in that sense... like a "time service" ?
[12:13:04] <biberu> jmer: yeah
[12:13:22] <biberu> code shouldn't call DateTime.Now directly
[12:13:30] <jmer> biberu: that would actually make sense, but when sending around the "result" from that service wouldn't you still need to use DateTime directly?
[12:13:42] <biberu> no
[12:14:05] <MatthiasVance> jmer: The Type, yes.
[12:14:08] <MatthiasVance> biberu: The Type!
[12:14:09] <MatthiasVance> type
[12:14:11] <MatthiasVance> Type?
[12:14:13] <MatthiasVance> Type type
[12:14:25] <Nasp> I have created a SystemTime service that can be called staticly
[12:14:49] <jmer> biberu: so you would write a DateTime wrapper?
[12:14:50] <MatthiasVance> You mean like .. DateTime?
[12:14:51] <Nasp> Since it may not be possible to inject a time service into everything
[12:15:07] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Why not?
[12:15:23] <Nasp> Take like an EF model if it creates the DateTime itself
[12:15:33] <MatthiasVance> Say what now?
[12:15:48] <Nasp> new Person {} and then have that set the CreatedTime
[12:15:58] <Nasp> Or other scenarios where you have some static code
[12:16:02] <MatthiasVance> I'd never let that be a responsibility of the model
[12:16:09] <biberu> jmer: not a wrapper as such, just a unit -> DateTime that gives me the current time when asked for it, e.g. interface IClock { public DateTime GetTime(); } or delegate DateTime GetTime();
[12:16:57] <biberu> jmer: as soon as you call DateTime.Now directly your function, and anything that calls your function, becomes impure and harder to test
[12:16:58] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Also did you know you can just request those instances from your SP?
[12:17:01] <MatthiasVance> Not saying you should, but you can
[12:17:10] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  You cant
[12:17:28] <Nasp> Only if you are using service locator pattern
[12:17:31] <Nasp> Which you shouldnt
[12:17:49] <MatthiasVance> Not like that :D
[12:17:58] <MatthiasVance> Not just throwing your SP around of course

[12:18:31] <MatthiasVance> Thank you!
[12:18:33] <Nasp> I dont think anybody is throwing their SP around
[12:18:40] <Nasp> But you need access to the SP for calling it
[12:18:45] <Nasp> And at the point you need it injected
[12:19:00] <Nasp> biberu:  I prefer the SystemTime approach it's a bit more simple
[12:19:20] <Nasp> Worst part is testing if it works
[12:19:29] <biberu> i don't see the problem with injecting a clock
[12:19:40] <Nasp> I dont either i just prefer not having to
[12:20:03] <biberu> it's a dependency just like a db connection or whatnot
[12:21:56] <Nasp> Sure but i find it annoying just like injecting a logger
[12:22:23] <biberu> why is it annoying?
[12:22:45] <biberu> is it just the typing, or something that makes it complicated?
[12:23:01] <jmer> biberu: Yeah that part I get. But you said you wouldn't send around the DateTime yet your Clock.GetTime returns a DateTime? :P
[12:24:17] <biberu> jmer: yeah, a datetime *value*, that's fine to pass around, it's calling the static methods on DateTime to create them directly that can cause issues
[12:24:43] <jmer> biberu: ok I think I misunderstood your first message then ^^ thank you for elaborating
[12:24:55] <Nasp> biberu:  I find it clutters the code
[12:25:07] <biberu> jmer: that'll make the code nondeterministic and impure, and much harder to e.g. configure tests for
[12:25:26] <jmer> biberu: yes. Hence my comments to Nasp  about tests being time dependant is weird/fucked up
[12:25:28] <Nasp> Since you usually easily have lets say 2-3 dependencies, then if all things also needs an ILogger and DateTime, then i would say taht becomes more of a global concern
[12:26:15] <biberu> jmer: i have some rather elaborate time based tests, but since i just tell the test what time it is and how it changes they are trivial to both write and run reliably ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[12:26:49] <jmer> biberu: exactly. the way it's supposed to be
[12:26:56] <jmer> testing a moving target just seems silly

[12:29:35] <biberu> Nasp: well, it's a step up over direct calls to DateTime, at least you gain some ability to configure it, but i'd still go for di
[12:30:12] <Nasp> Also it probably should have an UtcNow and Now
[12:30:16] <Nasp> And maybe DateTimeOffset
[12:30:29] <Nasp> I would kinda prefer if UtcNow was the default and you had to call .LocalNow

[17:35:13] <beepbeep> The desired situation is that you have a dotnet monitor container running inside of your cluster that is responsible for all of your apps that run in the cluster.

[19:04:39] <jmer> there's some pretty decent code as well
[19:05:58] <MichaelLong> jmer, a few internal projects are already migrated or at least partly updated (I've done some multi-targeting libraries) but I've to deal with lots of existing code bases + some branch specific tools and software envirnoments only allow .NET framework to interface with
[19:06:39] <jmer> MichaelLong: one of the big projects this year will be moving stuff to Redhat Openshift so the dev teams can get more end to end responsibility.
[19:06:42] <jmer> I am looking forward to that.
[19:07:45] <MichaelLong> oh container stuff
[19:08:04] <jmer> yeah
[19:08:18] <jmer> because now we have an ops team.. and it took me several weeks to just get access to the development DBs
[19:08:38] <jmer> Sooo fucking slow to get access to servers and stuff... ANd I'm not allowed on production in any way...
[19:09:05] <irwiss> wait how did you develop for the weeks where you had no dev db? 🤔
[19:09:06] <jmer> But the team (and managers) are aware this is an issue so it's getting fixed... But it's super tanker speed xD

[20:42:08] <newuser566> c# is quite annoying today, what is wrong with:  private int threadID { public get; public set;} ?
[20:42:31] <newuser566> isnt that how it is supposed to be, a private variable that you can only change trough methods that are public?

[20:45:25] <Slade> Lukky_, and you want to do something like that? let peopl use their mft account to sign in on your web app?
[20:46:37] <Lukky_> Slade: actually, I'm trying to program a client for that app... I have some documentation, which I got from someone who knows someone... I just can't figure out how to retrieve the token I already have for that app
[20:47:33] <Lukky_> Slade: since the app is not mine, I don't have access to its Azure dashboard
[20:47:48] <xb0o2> newuser566: You can only add further restrictions on the getter and setter. The member is already private so cannot be restricted any further.
[20:48:24] <Slade> Lukky_, so its like a desktop client?
[20:48:25] <Lukky_> newuser566: what is your final goal?
[20:48:41] <Lukky_> Slade: Yes, I'd write a desktop client

[20:51:24] <Lukky_> Ok, thanks, let me look this up
[20:51:36] <Slade> Lukky_, if you're trying to understand how modern authentication works yes.. i'm not sure if you can do what you want to be honest
[20:51:52] <xb0o2> See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/access-modifiers and https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/restricting-accessor-accessibility
[20:51:55] <newuser566> no, the other way around, i wnat:  private int threadID { public get; public set; }
[20:52:23] <xb0o2> You can't restrict a member to private access and then also attempt to give it public getters and setters.
[20:52:28] <newuser566> xb0o2: the user should not be able to change the property itself directly
[20:52:30] <xb0o2> If you want a public member, declare a public member.
[20:52:38] <Lukky_> Ok, thanks all... I'll get familiar with OIDC, then I'll see if that app offers the endpoints I'm expecting
[20:52:38] <newuser566> ok
[20:52:42] *** Joins: AbleBacon (~AbleBacon@user/AbleBacon)
[20:53:20] <xb0o2> But you're not restricting any access if it's public. Anything with a reference to the instance can get/set the value.
[20:53:36] <DevJohnC> you can declare a public getter and a private/init setter
[20:53:57] <jonp> newuser566: `public int ThreadID { get; private set; }`?
[20:54:04] <newuser566> of course one can write private threadId;   and then define public setter and getter
[20:54:11] <DevJohnC> jonp, no spoonfeeding
[20:54:14] <jonp> get & set can have different visibility
[20:54:16] <xb0o2> With a different property name, yes.
[20:54:18] <newuser566> its just weird that the short notation {get; set:} does not allow for it
[20:54:35] <_Shurik__> it's not strange, that's how it was designed
[20:54:42] <jonp> it does allow for it…?
[20:54:52] <xb0o2> But if all you're doing is declaring a backing field with a public getter and setter, just declare a public property and have the compiler generate the backing field for you.

[20:56:56] <_Shurik_> *automatic
[21:01:12] <newuser566> its a bit of a shotcomming for c# i guess, in java you just annotate your class with @Data and write private threadID;    which looks much more sane
[21:01:41] <newuser566> it gives you a public getter and setter
[21:02:14] <_Shurik_> You can just define public int ThreadID; and be done with it
[21:02:27] <jonp> newuser566: i imagine that's using some Bytecode rewriting
[21:03:19] <newuser566> _Shurik_: yeah, maybe google why public class variables are not a good idea if they need special setup trough a getter and setter
[21:03:20] <xb0o2> newuser566: You've just described `public int ThreadID { get; set; }`
[21:03:48] <newuser566> xb0o2: you too are missing the point, class variables should be private
[21:03:57] <_Shurik_> newuser566: if they need special setup
[21:03:59] <newuser566> xb0o2: how many years do you code?
[21:04:14] <xb0o2> The compiler generates a private backing field that you can get and set values to using the ThreadID member.
[21:04:53] <newuser566> public int ThreadID { get; set; }`         how is that private?
[21:04:55] <_Shurik_> but, it's better to create automatic property and enjoy it
[21:04:56] <redoc> happy new years all you mofos
[21:05:02] <xb0o2> i.e. you have a private member that is accessible through two public accessors.
[21:05:27] <_Shurik_> newuser566: you do realize that you can define getters and setters there, right?
[21:05:29] <xb0o2> See: https://sharplab.io/#v2:D4AQTAjAsAUCDMACciDCiDetE+UglgHYAuiAKgBYBOApgIYAmAkgCKaIDmNxA3IgM7c+AX1jCgA=
[21:05:35] <newuser566> xb0o2: yes, thats what i wanted. but apparently you cannot use the short {get; set;} version to get it
[21:05:36] <DevJohnC> why are you bickering? auto-properties can have different visibility on the getter and setter, it's much nicer than Java for properties
[21:05:51] <xb0o2> I think you're misunderstanding to be honest newuser566.
[21:08:32] <newuser566> DevJohnC: you could, if you could write it like this:  private int ThreadID { public get; public set; }            or you write your own setter and getters which is not really needed
[21:08:59] <DevJohnC> newuser566, why would you want to declare it private but have it publically gettable AND publically settable?
[21:09:15] <newuser566> ok, i close my argument
[21:09:18] <newuser566> thx for the info
[21:10:12] <_Shurik_> awesome, let's get back to talking about boobs
[21:11:17] <xb0o2> newuser566: I don't know about the data annotation you were talking about but see https://tinyurl.com/5ayrmrs5 for the generated code to hopefully demonstrate that you're essentially looking at multiple ways of doing exactly the same thing.
