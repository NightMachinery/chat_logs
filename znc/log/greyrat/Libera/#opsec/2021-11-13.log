[02:43:18] <jan6> hm
[02:43:26] <jan6> I have an interesting question..
[02:43:33] <jan6> you know shamir secret sharing, right
[02:43:34] *** Quits: _mobot (~mobot@95.183.53.137) (Quit: interrupt)
[02:44:00] <jan6> could you...instead of having stuff that combines INTO your desired data...
[02:44:05] <jan6> could you reverse the proccess
[02:44:27] <jan6> having known keys, which combine into some data?
[02:45:19] <jan6> and if so, could those keys be...say...ed25519 keys...say...ssh keys?
[02:45:32] <jan6> (probably yes to former, no to latter, I assume)
[02:45:33] *** Joins: _mobot (~mobot@95.183.53.137)
[02:48:02] <iz> no, if they are keys that's what the data is
[02:54:37] <Hydragyrum> well, it probably wouldn't be *too* hard to use the keys with a deterministic algorithm to create ssh keys from your individual secret
[03:00:12] <Hydragyrum> but it would probably be easier to do with RSA (because RSA keys work with variable keysize)
[03:13:12] <iz> hm, yeah, that's true.. it wouldn't be like a secret sharing scheme, but rather a deterministic key generation algorithm that could take any data as input
[03:13:38] <iz> or i guess it could just be tuned for keys
[03:24:50] <Hydragyrum> I'm not sure why you'd want the individual secrets to be able to be used as keys, seeing as the shared secret would be the important thing though
[03:27:28] <jessicara> if i'm understanding right, which i'm probably not, that sounds like diffie-hellman
[03:28:02] <jessicara> which results in keys for symmetric not asymmetric (because they have weird requirements)
[03:29:04] <Hydragyrum> take a look at the wikipedia article on shamir secret sharing, it's not really much like d-h at all
[03:29:36] <jessicara> i know
[03:29:50] <jessicara> but the stuff described above sounds more like diffie-hellman key exchange
[03:34:45] * jessicara has forgot the rather important type of homomorphism related to this and why it's a nightmare to try to create such a thing which isn't reversible

[08:10:51] <cads> hey does anyone know why the cyber intrusion killchain "Recon -> Weaponize -> Deliver -> Exploit -> Install -> Command & Control -> Act on Objective" is so long and complicated?
[08:14:08] <cads> It feels like from the perspective of the attacker some of the steps could be combined, like C&C with Act, and Deliver / Exploit / Install. Weaponization likewise can be done on recon. Doing this gets us: Recon -> Break -> Take
[08:14:28] <cads> (for theft missions)
[08:19:20] <cads> From a defense perspective, the 6 phase kill chain seems to help us granularize and separate independent security controls
[08:20:58] <cads> Is it the case that the cyber kill chain was formulated primarily for defense, rather than attack? Or is it "symmetric" - equally useful for attack and defense?

[18:27:35] <gartt> cads: I believe criticism of the cyber intrusion killchain comes from prevalence of non-traditional (outside --> in) attacks such as insider threats
