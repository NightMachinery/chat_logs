[02:09:17] <Gustavo6046> HDMI is larger

[02:09:43] <Gustavo6046> Okay, this port isn't exacttly trapezoid then, it has six sides, because each lateral side is split in two, and only the bottom split is slanted
[02:10:10] <hexnewbie> Gustavo6046: That's exactly what HDMI looks like
[02:10:14] <Gurkenglas> AeroNotix, misunderstanding: ls in VSCode gives me three entries, ls in the terminal application gives me 0 entries.
[02:10:34] <Gustavo6046> Oh wait, the big blue port that is more trapezoid, it's actually VGA I think!
[02:10:41] <hexnewbie> Gustavo6046: And DisplayPort is the same, but only one side of the bottom split is slanted.
[02:10:44] <matsaman> Gustavo6046: with holes? Yes "vga"

[02:13:06] <Gustavo6046> She let us bring it over to here. I'd often plug it into the VGA port (of the other notebook, which is the actual my notebook, but its motherboard is likely shorted near USB2 and SATA) and use it as a second monitor

[02:13:52] <Gustavo6046> I think the CRT monitor has long been dumped now. It was burning more and more, or something. It got dark a lot and it always took some shaking around to correct that.
[02:14:00] <Gustavo6046> Plus it was awkward to put it on the desk.
[02:14:07] <Dan39> shaking? like the images, or physically? haha

[03:51:10] <octav1a> Hello, I'm trying to diasnose a problem with packet loss ~5% between a raspberry pi and a ubiquiti network device. There are no other devices in between. I'm using a USB ethernet adapter, which I've tested with another machine (ubuntu 20.04) and I get no packet loss with the same usb ethernet and same cable there. Therefore I'm assuming this is some kind of driver issue. Does anyone have any suggestions I can try?

[03:52:37] <JyZyXy> and nct6775.c.rej containing the Hunk 2 in its entirety. so i don't get any indication as to _why_
[03:52:50] <Dagmar> octav1a: If it's a driver problem unless you're very well-versed in C and ethernet drivers, you're done because there's nothing you can do other than try a different dongle.
[03:52:56] <AeroNotix> JyZyXy: you could try to apply the patch manually
[03:53:06] <AeroNotix> as in navigate to the file and edit it to look like what's in the patch
[03:53:07] <Dagmar> JyZyXy: You look at the patch.  That's how you figure out why it didn't apply.
[03:53:17] <AeroNotix> ( I did not look at the patch to see how much code it is )
[03:53:28] <ayecee> JyZyXy: applying it manually means using a text editor to remove the lines that it says to remove, and add the lines that it says to add
[03:53:30] <Dagmar> octavia: If this is gigabit ethernet and you are not using a RPI4, _the USB bus is why_
[03:53:30] <JyZyXy> Dagmar: i did spend 30 minutes looking before i even asked!
[03:53:40] <kurahaupo> JyZyXy: The main reason for a patch hunk to fail is because the "old" half doesn't match what's in the target file
[03:53:45] <JyZyXy> and i saw no reason for the fail
[03:53:47] <Dagmar> JyZyXy: That's very sad considering how short the patch is.
[03:53:48] <optimant> Dagmar: my thought exactly

[03:54:26] <tm512> he's pulling the SSD and putting it into another system to wipe it, I guess he's had issues installing lubuntu in the past when the disk already had a valid partition table
[03:54:31] <Dagmar> optimant: It's not a "thought".  The USB bus isn't fast enough to carry gigabit speeds there
[03:54:37] <Dan39> tm512: try the #ubuntu channel on this network
[03:54:38] <Dagmar> optimant: It's just plain fact
[03:54:42] <octav1a> optimant: it's Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Rev 1.2 , here is the ethernet info: https://bpa.st/5AZA
[03:55:03] <Dan39> hmm
[03:55:07] <octav1a> ayecee, I'm testing using ping with 200 count
[03:55:12] <optimant> Agreed, I meant we didn't hear what h/w it was. You got to the point quicker :)
[03:55:18] <Dagmar> optimant: The only reason the integrated ethernet can do gigglebit speeds is because its' not on the USB bus like the 3A/B+ are
[03:55:25] <optimant> Yep
[03:55:27] <ayecee> octav1a: how do you mean, 200 count
[03:55:51] <octav1a> ping -c 200 <address>
[03:55:51] <Dagmar> On the positive side, regular TCP transmit will deal with that packet loss
[03:55:51] <AeroNotix> ping -c 200 guessing
[03:56:10] <octav1a> usually I'll see loss in the first 10-20 packets though

[06:23:27] <zim> stanrifkin, emacs install: "After this operation, 271 MB of additional disk space will be used."
[06:23:29] <ZombieChicken> There are articles out there about it's limits. It works for the most part, but if you want something that does things like e2e encryption and other fun features, IRC isn't a choice
[06:23:36] <pluri> that way you can signal your agreement or disagreement without actually constructing an argument :)
[06:23:47] <ayecee> control of the protocol outside an organization made it difficult for orgs to add their own unique features.

[06:24:51] <ayecee> no, irc lacks that feature

[06:25:53] <ZombieChicken> you mean the "#MeToo" twitter thing that sadly translates to "pound me too"?
[06:26:03] <pluri> no, on irc you actually have to type something, if you want to participate to a conversation. on discord, you just react with an emoji. it's a simple solution for social signalling with zero meaningful, intellectual contribution to the conversation

[08:11:30] <Sauvin> labrador, a great deal depends on who's DOING the statistical work, and how disciplined said work is.
[08:12:18] <Psi-Jack> Yeah, my experience is in cyber security monitoring for servers, and seeing a lot more tor traffic than usual.

When I took over as op, I had that rule struck down, citing distribution of Linux distros from project pages via tor.

Then someone else told me to just disable secure boot and I could boot Kali in Oracle VM. And now
[08:51:40] <patriksarah> Ive decided to install Kali as a dual boot but it doesnt work because it takes me to Grub safe mode..... and I cant boot using the harddrive unless secure boot is off..... but i believe I could boot using secure boot before I signed the keys

[11:30:40] <hexnewbie> labrador: Do you think its a nice chatbot will help eliza not to be cool?
[11:31:18] <lockywolf> hexnewbie, vfat does not have "max-mount-counts", therefore "mount" will not know whether it is time to run fsck on mount. Given that vfat has been used in Linux for a long time, there is likely to be some work-around, which saves the amount of time the fs has been mounted, and forces fsck when needed.

So most likely no
[13:31:06] <hexnewbie> That is, most definitely no
[13:31:46] <hexnewbie> NFS works like a regular filesystem, and does no magic with regards to devices, sockets or FIFOs. It simply holds them.
