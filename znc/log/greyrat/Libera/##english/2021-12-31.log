[15:07:44] <samuely> I just went to the tree and checked card. I have written 'Lead a New Life' on it.
[15:09:00] <Alex123> hello all, I was wandering how to express it more clear. I want to show to options "Based on field value" and other option "Arbitrary recurring"
[15:09:22] <Alex123> and Arbitrary recurring I mean, ever 7th day of the month
[15:09:28] <Alex123> or every 13 days
[15:10:13] <kurahaupo> Alex123: every 7th of the month isn't "arbitrary", but it might be "indefinite"
[15:11:05] <kurahaupo> Alex123: are you referring to how long the recurrence lasts and/or how many times it occurs in total?
[15:12:10] <kurahaupo> Overall, is this issue about asking the user to schedule something?
[15:12:44] <Alex123> basically I want send email, they can pick their own schedule
[15:12:57] <Alex123> which will be every x days or every 3 day of the week
[15:13:06] <Alex123> or every year
[15:13:17] <kurahaupo> So if they fill out the field, you'll use what they ask, otherwise you'll pick something else?
[15:13:48] <Alex123> or they can pick date 
[15:14:02] <Alex123> and say its gonna be yearly the same day as the date they picked
[15:14:16] <Alex123> or the same date they picked every month
[15:14:24] <Alex123> like a monthly bill
[15:14:24] <kurahaupo> Whilst "arbitrary" may be correct, it's a matter of perspective. Your deliberate choice seems to me like an arbitrary (random) thing
[15:15:02] <Alex123> can not think other way to label it
[15:15:10] <kurahaupo> When you say "field", what are you referring to?
[15:15:32] <Alex123> its not random but not anchored to a specific date 
[15:15:45] <Alex123> field can be a birthday
[15:16:02] <Alex123> or anniversary 
[15:16:29] <kurahaupo> OK. So you're asking if they want to peg the first cycle to that date, or let the machine choose one at random?
[15:16:50] <Alex123> arbitrary example will be, send email 1st Tuesday of the month
[15:17:35] <Alex123> its not connected to the any event (field) of the client 
[15:17:53] <Alex123> but will send email on every  1st Tuesday of the month

[15:21:01] <kurahaupo> And separately, to ask how often?
[15:22:01] <Alex123> there are two different "ways" one based on the picked date (field) other one they pick

And by "monthly", I mean that's the same day of the week each month. So "first Tuesday of every month" is the same thing as "monthly starting on 4 Jan 2020"
[15:28:01] <Alex123> there is no random, but it moves
[15:28:16] <Alex123> 1st Tuesday of Month
[15:28:32] <kurahaupo> Alex123: How to the user's date fields come into this?
[15:28:57] <Alex123> there are two separate options 
[15:29:07] <Alex123> the user date field is other way to do it
[15:29:19] <Alex123> lets say they pick July 2
[15:29:26] <Alex123> and they say this event is monthly 
[15:29:39] <Alex123> every 2nd of the month it will happen
[15:29:53] <kurahaupo> OK, so there are 6 options not 4?
[15:30:46] <Alex123> 2 options, 2nd option has over 6! combinations 
[15:31:04] <Alex123> (720)
[15:31:38] <Alex123> basically you can schedule something like this with second option 
[15:32:11] <Alex123> I want every 3 year, every month, 2nd week of the month on Tuesdays send email
[15:32:41] <kurahaupo> Options 1&3&5 = they pick a starting date and/or day of the week , options; options 2&4&6 = the computer chooses for them. Options 1&2 = every fixed number of days (typically a multiple of 7); options 3&4 = every fixed number of months (typically 1 or 12), on a fixed day of the month; options 5&6 = every fixed number of months (typically 1), on a fixed day of the week in each month
[15:33:31] <kurahaupo> Does "computer picks a starting point" actually come into this?
[15:33:49] <Alex123> for option 2 it starts now, from first rule match
[15:34:11] <Alex123> for option 1 happens every x days, months, years starting the date picked
[15:34:25] <kurahaupo> So "pick a start date, or leave empty to start today"?
[15:34:45] <Alex123> there is no date for option 2 at all
[15:36:10] <Alex123> are you familiar the unix cron
[15:36:17] <Alex123> option 2 is basically the cron format

[15:39:27] <kurahaupo> Cron does day-of-week and/or day-of-month; it can't quite do 3rd Tuesday of each month
[15:40:54] <kurahaupo> (To achieve that using crontab, you have to either run a job every Tuesday and check each time whether the day-of-month is between 15 and 21, or run a job daily betwen 15 and 21 each month, and check if day-of-week is Tuesday.)
[15:41:17] <Alex123> its not a cron directly but very similar 
[15:41:51] <Alex123> for example we a client they want to set up their event 1st Friday of the month and send email
[15:42:00] <Alex123> they don't care what date it is 
[15:42:35] <Alex123> it will be saved in db, cron similar to the option 2 but not 100%
[15:42:57] <Alex123> just to make it clear
[15:45:01] <kurahaupo> Let me put it another way: there are about 3 options for how you describe a recurrent event mathematically, such that you'd put that in a database. However there are many different ways a user could describe those. As I said before, first Tuesday of every month starting ASAP, is mathematically identical to "on the same weekday every month starting on 4 January 2022"
[15:46:37] <Alex123> "on the same weekday every month starting on 4 January 2022" if the week is 1st week
[15:46:38] <kurahaupo> If you get them to pick a start date on a calendar, with days arranged in 7 columns, then you can allow them to think either way and get to the same answer.
[15:47:12] <kurahaupo> "if the week is the 1st week" <- yes obviously that's what I mean
[15:47:35] <Alex123> ok how would label it this
[15:48:01] *** Quits: diskin (~diskin@ec2-3-124-171-230.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[15:49:35] *** Joins: diskin (~diskin@31.23.174.90)
[15:50:14] <kurahaupo> I would show options "every [number] weeks", "every [number] months on the [number] [weekday]", and "every [number] months on the [number] day" where [number] is a numeric entry field, and [weekday] is a drop-down list.
[15:50:43] <kurahaupo> If you want you could add "every [number] days" and "every [number] years", which are simply multiples of the first and last options.
[15:51:31] <Alex123>  I don't mean how to label each value, but they way of picking top level option label
[15:51:40] <Alex123> *the
[15:51:51] <kurahaupo> A radio button next to each of those 3 lines
[15:52:21] <kurahaupo> Overall label "Recurrence". Oh, and 4th option: "one-off event"
[15:53:03] <kurahaupo> Have a look at how, say, Google Calendar presents these options. https://calendar.google.com
[15:53:27] <kurahaupo> Or office365 if that's your prefernce.
[15:53:29] <kurahaupo> preference
[15:54:12] <Me-me> Pref-runce.
[15:54:12] <Alex123> yea they have subset of it and they call it "Custom recurrence"

[16:29:38] <kurahaupo> samuely: "resolve" is stronger than "plan". It implies intent and determination, not merely a proposal. Also "new year's resolution" is a customary phrase in English, so everyone knows what you mean. The real meaning is "what will you do differently from last year, to improve yourself". Appropriate answers are things like "lose weight", "quit smoking", "start a family", "demand a pay rise (and quit if I don't get enough)", or "retire to the country"
[16:30:04] <kurahaupo> "Learn a new language" would be a typical answer, yes.

[16:48:46] <twb> Did you know that to get people to stop smoking, my government scientifically determined what is the least cool colour?
[16:49:21] <twb> Whereas New Zealand just said "it's illegal to ever sell a cigarette to anyone born after 2005"
[16:49:46] <twb> Personally I would have gone further, and made them a prescription drug.
[16:50:57] <twb> If you're born diabetic, you need to get a doctor to check you every 6 months to see if you have magically stopped being diabetic.  If you don't go, you don't get a prescription for drugs you need to stay alive.
[16:50:58] <kurahaupo> I started suggesting "can't sell to anyone born after 1990" a while back. It's taken the NZ govt 15 years to catch up.
[16:51:30] <kurahaupo> twb: so they don't distinguish between type A and type B diabetes?
[16:51:32] <samuely> kurahaupo i concerned if include should be in the third person form after which 
[16:51:34] <kurahaupo> that sucks
[16:52:31] <twb> "born diabetic" so >shrug<
[16:52:33] <kurahaupo> samuely: sorry, I've been away making "happy new year" phone calls. What was your question?
[16:52:43] <twb> I assume it's because if you take enough insulin you can, somehow, get hiiiiiiiiigh
[16:53:06] <twb> So they want to make sure you don't steal the "I have diabetes" card from your 90yo grandad and continue collecting his drugs
[16:53:19] <twb> after he dies
[16:53:28] <samuely> kurahaupo ... which includes ... , the verb form is right?
[16:53:30] <kurahaupo> twb: if you take too much insulin, you could go hypoglycemic and faint from low blood sugar?
[16:54:00] <kurahaupo> samuely: "which" is treated as singular or plural, whichever matches the thing(s) it's referring to.
[16:54:16] <samuely> My resolution is to lead a new life, which includes ...
[16:54:47] <samuely> so, i was correct, just was not sure
[16:55:00] <kurahaupo> samuely: "John showed me some books, which are written in a foreign language" vs "John showed me a book, which is signed by its author"

[16:55:36] <twb> "which" feels sloppy there
