[01:19:05] <iDrougge> (Or a similar remote desktop solution, I know I've been forced to use Citrix to access the on-prem Jira)

[01:20:02] <iDrougge> c355e3b: That is at least somewhat understandable.
[01:20:22] <c355e3b> and I've had a manager who was trying to get me onto a Chromebook for yera

[01:21:04] <iDrougge> He also assumed that every competitor already has access to their source code.
[01:22:04] <iDrougge> I was interviewing for a job where the pay wasn't quite what I wanted, and they tried to sugar the deal by saying that I would receive a nice Macbook, whereas most of their employees just had mid-range Dells.
[01:22:16] <c355e3b> oof

[15:32:17] <epilys> ^ Could someone proofread this if they have the time?
[15:38:49] <albertito> do you use any tooling to signal/check "if you change this line of code here, also change this other line in this other file" ?
[15:39:31] <epilys> how would you even achieve this? you have to track the line's position through diffs and snapshots
[15:40:02] <albertito> epilys: "here is the tables" -> here are the tables
[15:40:10] <albertito> epilys: I'll report anything else privately not to spam everyone :)
[15:40:15] <epilys> albertito, thank you!! :)
[15:40:52] <albertito> epilys: yeah, it can be a commit check. We have such a thing at work but I haven't seen anything commonly used outside, so I wonder if there's something I'm missing. I don't even know how to search for it (I tried a few random things, and failed)
[15:41:34] <epilys> i haven't seen such a thing anywhere hm
[15:42:01] <epilys> adding comments not enough?
[15:43:19] <albertito> epilys: sure, it was more out of curiosity than anything else
[15:48:00] *** brabo is now known as phanes
[15:48:29] *** phanes is now known as brabo
[15:49:10] <epilys> albertito, you could use a key-value plain text format to store the paired lines, and then at the commit check scan through the hunks and see if a change is unmatched
[15:49:22] <epilys> also, update the k-v store with new line positions
[15:50:06] <epilys> you could even store that as a git object to prevent littering the tree
[15:50:12] <albertito> epilys: thanks! I know how to build such a thing; I was more wondering if there was something pre-existing that everyone used and I haven't heard about :)
[15:50:45] <epilys> sorry, I can't resist yak shaving.
[15:50:50] <albertito> honestly I'd just have structured comments, the target doesn't have to have a line number, just a file name, and that is enough to provide a quick check for preventing accidents
[15:51:04] <albertito> epilys: oh, no worries!
[15:51:11] <albertito> by all means keep shaving, I don't mind at all

[23:15:30] <riv> haha
[23:15:33] <riv> what do you not like about graphql?
[23:16:37] <technomancy> the type system just has a bunch of really stupid limitations
[23:16:50] <technomancy> like ... you can't share abstractions across input types vs result types
[23:16:52] <technomancy> makes no sense
[23:17:03] <technomancy> nullability is opt-out instead of opt-in
[23:17:10] <riv> oof
[23:17:13] <riv> that's annoying
[23:17:42] <technomancy> I could see it being useful specifically in cases where your data model is a graph but using it as a rest replacement (like we do at work) is stupid
[23:17:57] <technomancy> oh also it abuses HTTP response codes

[23:34:35] <Forty-Bot> riv: yes, it's absolutely terrible
[23:34:52] <Forty-Bot> at least when using it for devicetrees and not json :)
[23:36:51] <riv> D:
[23:36:58] <riv> devicetrees? like a hardware thing?
[23:37:18] <Forty-Bot> yes, it's the hardware description language most prominently used by Linux
[23:38:02] <Forty-Bot> new device descriptions ("bindings") must include json schema describing themselves
[23:38:47] <Forty-Bot> IME it's inordinately difficult to express any constraint more complex than "must have property X"
[23:39:17] <Forty-Bot> and it's very non-obvious what the best way to go about specifying such constraints is
