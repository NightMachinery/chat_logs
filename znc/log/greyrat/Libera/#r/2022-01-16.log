[10:49:48] <__that__> Hi all
[10:51:59] <__that__> I would like to have a config file where I get the underlying absolute path and from there I construct relative paths to key folders in my project. In Python I could just create a config module, get the absolute path and construct the subsequent relative paths. Then I include config in any other file and use it as config.data_path
[10:52:23] <__that__> Could anyone please hint me what's the canonical way you normally do this in R?
[11:00:26] <rickyrick> I just set the working directory ._.
[11:03:44] <__that__> rickyrick, thanks. I just found a way of doing that with file.path and source
[11:08:14] <__that__> rickyrick and what about code refactoring. Does R studio have anything helpful?

[11:41:11] <__that__> rickyrick I don't know if you replied back. Sorry.
[11:44:35] <__that__> I have constructed a path with file.path but read.csv2 doesn't seem to like it. setwd does though
[11:47:31] <__that__> oh, I see R swallows everything. I was passing a vector to file.path instead of multiple arguments
[12:03:49] <DrNostril> you can do it!
[12:04:17] <DrNostril> you know you can read the docs in Rstudio by typing ?command into the console...?

[18:13:17] <DK3> hello, i have a value (RandomForest) with predict price. the price has alot of decimals in my csv output. any ideas how can i set the precision on that?
[18:13:51] <DK3> e.g randomForest(formula = preis ~ ., data = train_2, importance = T) but it has to many decimals
[18:14:00] <fendur> DK3: could cast it to char first with sprintf()
[18:14:18] <fendur> nah. round()
[18:15:00] <mefistofeles> round and round!
[18:15:08] <fendur> sprintf was dumb because while it would cut off decimals, it would not round.
[18:15:20] <fendur> at least i think it would not
[18:16:23] <fendur> ok it would round sprintf("%0.1f", 0.99)
[18:16:30] <fendur> still, round() seems more suited
[18:17:15] <DK3> https://controlc.com/5163b98a tried it like that but i guess round only outputs to the console
[18:18:12] <DK3> ah got it right now, thank you
[18:25:40] <confuzius> if the price has lots of decimals why are you changing it? a computer should handle it fine...
[18:26:25] <confuzius> or you do not want fine grained accuracy??

[21:28:36] <Kabouik> I have a date range slider input on a shiny application, but I need the left handle to be in October instead of January (i.e., non-numeric order), and I need it to be independent of year (just month-day to month-day, regardless of year). How would you proceed?
[21:29:01] <Kabouik> I'm trying things with lubridate but this is a rabbit hole and I don't see the light
[21:29:09] *** Joins: rickyrick (~rickyrick@S01069050ca454523.vf.shawcable.net)
[21:40:45] <twrk> can you customize the range?
[21:43:29] <Kabouik> I don't see how
[21:44:52] <Kabouik> I can extract months and days on my data with lubridate::month(df$Date) and same with day(), and merge them even, but they are not numeric or dates anymore so sliderInput() doesn't accept them
[21:48:49] <Kabouik> Even if we simplify and convert dates to to yday with yday(df$Date), I still have this issue that the slider will go from 1 to 366
[21:49:25] <Kabouik> And I really need the range slider to allow selecting things like 300-50 as range
[22:00:37] <Kabouik> There is dateRangeInput() too but I don't see how to ignore yyyy in that. And if I convert my variable to %m-%d format only, it won't be a date format anymore and dateRangeInput() won't swallow it
