[09:33:45] <rmzs0711> Hello, I want to participate in the GSoC year, so now I am trying to go through the tutorial for HLS
[09:33:46] <rmzs0711> https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/plugin-tutorial.html#anatomy-of-a-plugin
[09:33:46] <rmzs0711> There is a line at the end of this paragraph "To add a new plugin, simply extend the list of allPlugins and rebuild.". I passed the Haskell course in my university, but it was like an introduction to functional programming as a science discipline, so the big projects for me are a little confusing. Did I understand correctly, that the `allPlugins`
[09:33:47] <rmzs0711> is in the Main module? If yes, where is this module defined? Same question to Ide.Plugin module. Is a way to find the path more "easily" exist, then ask in the community?

[19:31:21] <karim> I hope somebody can clarify some points first, What is the assumed background/experience for taking on this project?
[19:37:43] <karim> Other than this, How can I contibute,I've read the contributing guide, thought it's a bit outdated. So, Is there a starting point in the repo that can make the things simpler?
[19:38:34] <karim> Maybe a directory, or a file I can read to have a basic understanding of HLS architecture?
