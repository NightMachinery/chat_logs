[02:00:09] <somiaj> It finally released in the last 30 mins or so

[02:00:57] <Foxfir3> cool

[02:04:14] <greycat> The main web site is showing the release as a news article.
[02:04:51] <greycat> Foxfir3: if you scroll down past the crap at the top, it's the very first news article.  It's on the main page.  Don't know what else you're looking for.
[02:05:40] <Blondie101010> https://release.debian.org/ says: Debian 11 "bullseye" will be released on 2021-08-14.
[02:06:33] <greycat> And www.debian.org says:  Debian 11 "bullseye" released
[02:06:48] <Foxfir3> its a poorly made website
[02:07:03] <greycat> In what way, exactly?
[02:07:42] <Foxfir3> scaring off newbies. just find out what is going on and where to get the right ISO is a journey

[02:09:39] <Blondie101010> it downloaded it automatically when I got to that page
[02:09:58] <greycat> and... as I just learned it starts downloading itself if you go to this page in chrome with JS turned on.  Yikes.

[02:10:57] <Blondie101010> not sooo hard to find other ISOs, but definitely not obvious
[02:11:15] <somiaj> I guess I always get a prompt about what to do with downloading (I don't let it just auto save without me telling it where to go)
[02:11:52] <greycat> I didn't even know it was starting a download until I happened to glance at the lower left corner of the browser window and saw a download in progress.  No confirmation prompt, nothing.
[02:12:34] <somiaj> yea, I even reloaded the page, got the same prompt. I could see maybe if you link to that page from the main site to start downloading, but sharing that as a link to start downloading is a bit much
[02:12:46] <greycat> Obviously browser-dependent.
[02:13:25] <somiaj> browser + settings, I have a 'do this automatically from here on' checkbox I can select, which I never do, so I manually have to choose each time

Release day we're working to currently - as discussed in various mailing lists is August 14th 2021. There's a hard freeze from July 17th with only the most urgent security fixes after that date. The main CD builder died - all disks failed at once, so the current target is August 14th, or even later.

[04:19:20] * greycat googles it
[04:20:00] <Khepra> it should have a knob offering auto save into Downloads, or asking for destination. choosing the latter basically removes automatic download without selecting where to save
[04:20:02] <knotMez> I had a problem with a USB microscope that would overflow my log so I am putting /var on a separate partition this time around. Now I have to decide how big to make /var
[04:20:08] <computerworm110> knotMez, You use it the .sign file to verify the SHA512SUMS file. But you have to add the Debian key to your keyring first. 
[04:20:38] <knotMez> computerworm110 i just want the number so I can look at them
[04:20:39] <greycat> Google gave me a 5-step recipe that I'm following now.
[04:21:13] <computerworm110> knotMez, you can download the SHA512SUMS file and open it in a text editor
[04:21:17] <knotMez> usually I just compare like the first 4 and last 4 digits
[04:21:18] <DoctorD90> I saw now the release update. Finally! Happy new release to everyone :D congrats to the all team!
[04:21:19] <greycat> It's ... very thoroughly hidden.
[04:24:15] <knotMez> computerworm110 I think I may have found it
[04:24:51] <Khepra> themill: will you do the honors of starting the bookworm pool 1 ? :)
[04:24:53] <knotMez>  .0.0 does worry me
[04:25:00] <greycat> P.S. there are only two choicse in google-chrome: allow sites to automatically download multiple files, or do not allow sites to automatically download multiple files.
[04:25:26] <Khepra> I never understood what that really did
[04:25:52] <greycat> I'm hoping that the second one does what I want.
[04:26:50] <Khepra> greycat: in chromium theres "Ask where to save each file before downloading" knob
[04:27:09] <Khepra> open the Settings (hamburger) and type Download in the search bar, it should present the knob to you
[04:27:12] <computerworm110> I'm glad you found what you needed knotMez. :) 
[04:28:19] <greycat> Khepra: ... ok, yes, I do get that one as well.  So apparently multiple independent boolean knobs.
[04:28:35] <greycat> Might as well change 'em both.
[04:28:58] <Khepra> well no, the allow multiple downloads is something else, methinks about JS APIs allowing sites to store/download multiple files in one go
[04:29:05] <Khepra> it's orthogonal to choosing the target directory
[04:29:22] <computerworm110> BTW, anyone who want to verify images the automated way can add the Debian CD signing key to their keyring by running the following command in the terminal: gpg --keyserver keyring.debian.org --recv 6294BE9B 
[04:29:32] <greycat> It's what google gave me when I typed "disable automatic downloads in google-chrome"

[04:34:28] <greycat> !buster-security
[04:34:28] <dpkg> On Debian 10 "Buster" systems, there are two repositories that you should have in your sources.list aside from your main mirror.  You should have an entry for "buster/updates" which is security updates (ask me about <security>) and also an entry for "buster-updates" which is other updated packages.  See also <sources.list>.
[04:34:33] <greycat> fuck...
[04:34:37] <greycat> !bullseye-security

[04:34:56] <somiaj> coc0nut: no this is standard, this is just giving you a (N)ote that your release is now oldstable, it has a year support (then more with LTS)

[04:35:37] <Khepra> depends on what s/he _wants_ :)
[04:35:40] <greycat> somiaj: if they got an "E:" line then action is needed
[04:35:43] <somiaj> coc0nut: you should consider updating to bullseye, but you have a year, and some prefer to wait a point release or two to upgrade.

[05:05:39] <PMT> loading any bug seems to be ISEing for me, woops
[05:05:50] <somiaj> yea, bugs.debian.org is down at the moment
[05:06:00] <knotMez> somiaj normal use
[05:06:10] <greycat> we don't know what you think "normal use" is
[05:06:30] <knotMez> greycat you could take a guess
[05:06:33] <Khepra> there's at least two normal uses with wildly different /var sizes. between those using apt and those using apt-get .)
[05:06:37] <greycat> My guess would be wrong for you.
[05:07:30] <knotMez> somiaj bugs.debian.org being down does not instill confidence
[05:07:32] <greycat> On a normal desktop system, there's no real reason for a separate /var at all, so the question doesn't even have practical impact.
[05:07:56] <knotMez> greycat I had a bad driver overflow a log and lock my system up
[05:08:27] <knotMez> was a USB microscope that did it
[05:08:44] <knotMez> worked in Buster though
[05:09:03] <knotMez> there's no way I am plugging it into this PC
[05:09:32] <knotMez>  my /var is mounted in /
[05:09:49] <knotMez> SSD very fast log fills up disk in seconds
[05:10:22] <Khepra> sounds fishy
[05:11:24] <knotMez> uvcvideo 1-6:1.0: Entity type for entity Extension 5 was not initialized!
[05:11:37] <knotMez> just spams that endlessly
[05:12:05] <greycat> Fishy or not, knowing how much content other users have in their /var directories is not going to help you with your problem.

[05:12:30] <knotMez> greycat putting /var on its own partition should solve the log overflow problem
[05:12:44] <greycat> You'll still have a full /var and all the problems that causes.
[05:12:50] <greycat> If you think that will help you, do it.
[05:12:58] <knotMez> I plan to
[05:14:14] <knotMez> greycat I just want to get an idea of how big I should make the partition
[05:14:29] <greycat> run "du -sh /var" on your system, and multiply by some fudge factor
[05:14:32] <knotMez> I know how much spave my /var is taking up
[05:14:38] <knotMez> I did that already
[05:14:39] <greycat> there ya go
[05:14:52] <knotMez> I just want to see if it is representitive or not
[05:14:58] <greycat> Irrelevant.
[05:15:06] <knotMez> to you perhaps
[05:15:10] <greycat> You need to size it for YOUR needs, not OURS.
[05:15:45] <knotMez> fine i'll just make it twice as big as what I'm using now
[05:15:55] <knotMez> thank you for all of your help

[05:18:38] <knotMez> Khepra ta
[05:18:58] <Khepra> but that's extreme for my normal /var sizes
[05:19:13] <greycat> that's far above average for a desktop system, I would guess
[05:19:14] <knotMez> it does seem like it mine's only 3.4 GB
[05:19:22] <greycat> but knotMez never told us what their system is used for
[05:19:29] <knotMez> desktop 
[05:19:58] <Khepra> I'm currently on gentoo and my /var contains portage, binpkgs, distfiles  and a few snapshots of all that.  see? totally specific to me and meaningless to you.
[05:20:31] <knotMez> Khepra not really it made me adjust my partition size upwards
[05:20:54] <knotMez> I was going to go with 7 GB but now I think I'll go with 20 GB
[05:21:00] <greycat> and if someone else told your theirs was 1.2 GB would you have shrunk yours?  you see the problem here?

[05:23:53] <Khepra> knotMez: 20GB for /var is ridiculous. if anything, you separate specific subdirectories out, that are dedicated to particular storage workloads, like /var/log, /var/db/postgres, etc...
[05:24:31] <knotMez> Khepra I'm not going to use the whole drive anyways
[05:24:52] <Khepra> separating /var/log makes _some_ sense as a prevention of log overflow from locking up everything, but is not a solution, as greycat noted, it'll just casue all the (cascade) issues of logs not being able to be written

[05:27:07] <pasky> why not have a separate /var/log partition then
[05:27:32] <knotMez> it is /var/log that is the problem
[05:28:01] <somiaj> is it still a problem? Or are you trying to isolate it in case something goes creazy and fills logs
[05:28:27] <knotMez> somiaj it would be a problem if I plugged that USB camera in
[05:28:34] <greycat> if /var/log is causing problems on a regular basis, separating that out so the rest of /var doesn't get screwed is a wise move
[05:28:51] <knotMez> nah only that one piece of hardware ever caused a problem
[05:29:02] <knotMez> like i said it got fixed in Buster too
[05:29:14] <Khepra> then what's the point of all this?
[05:29:27] <knotMez> Khepra in case any other log overflows
[05:29:40] <knotMez> for any unknown as of now reason call it a precaution
[05:29:49] <Khepra> knotMez: so the same advice, to separate out just /var/log, applies
[05:30:26] <Khepra> if you separate out /var/ , then you've only done half the work and clogged logfiles will block other things using /var/
[05:30:34] <knotMez>  maybe make /var/log a link to /dev/null?
[05:30:44] <knotMez> that should fix it
[05:30:55] <greycat> if you don't want logs, just turn off rsyslog
[05:30:58] <knotMez> we don't need any stinking logs
[05:31:01] <Khepra> why stop there :) pull the plug and all the bugs will cease to be :)
[05:31:25] <Khepra> jokes aside, configure journald for in-memory only volatile storage, and limit it to, pffft, dunno, 100MB?
[05:31:37] <Khepra> (and don't forward to rsyslog, as greycat indicated)
[05:31:39] <knotMez> greycat i will take that under advisement
[05:32:51] <knotMez> Khepra that sounds like a good idea
[05:33:08] <knotMez> really logs being written always bugged me
[05:33:22] <knotMez> seems like a waste of activity

[05:34:04] <knotMez> Khepra is it really going to do me any good?
[05:35:33] <Khepra> welp if you ever have an issue and want to check the logs, you'll be, like "gee, I wsh I had the logs enabled".
[05:36:18] <Khepra> good behaved, logrotated logs are a benefit, and almost never a problem. the rare unruly children can be put under control

[05:39:52] <greycat> As long as the volume is constant, that's good.  You want boring logs.
[05:40:11] <Khepra> you can devnull specific log entries via rsyslog config
[05:40:38] <knotMez> Khepra i never got so involved
[05:41:04] <knotMez> it's easie to just give the logs a lot of room and let them do whatever it is that they do
[05:42:14] <Khepra> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[05:42:32] <knotMez> really /var/log just takes up 17 MB
[05:42:41] <knotMez> which seems reasonable to me
[05:42:57] <greycat> then what's taking up all the space?

[05:43:06] <knotMez> in /var?
[05:43:13] <knotMez> beats me it just scrolls by
[05:43:17] <knotMez>  I could page it
[05:43:34] <knotMez> that is something I've been wondering myself
[05:43:47] <knotMez> is there a way to list by size?
[05:43:52] <knotMez> I know there is I've done it
[05:44:06] <greycat> cd /var; du -sk * | sort -n | tail
[05:44:31] <knotMez> apparently cache takes up room
[05:44:54] <Khepra> speaking of .... anyone knows if rsyslog is dropped from installing by default, on fresh new bullseye systems? with journald now persistent by default, there was talk about dropping rsyslog.

[05:46:09] <knotMez> greycat looks like apt is the big culprit
[05:46:44] <greycat> if you don't want the old .deb package files, use "apt-get clean" on a regular basis, or try to train yourself to use "apt upgrade" instead of "apt-get upgrade", as the former will auto-delete the files
[05:46:45] <knotMez> I like apt so it can take some space
[05:47:02] <somiaj> you can also configure apt-get to auto delete files, it just doen'st by default

[09:45:33] <staticdev> morning, main page of Debian is broken when you click download https://www.debian.org/.. are people aware?
[09:45:38] <somiaj> jochum: ahh, apt search doesn't use them correctly, it is apt list
[09:45:49] <jochum> staticdev: for me its fine
[09:45:55] <somiaj> jochum: so 'apt list ~E' lists all essential packages
[09:46:20] <somiaj> seems the search patterns only work for remove/purge/list (maybe insatll)
[09:46:46] <staticdev> jochum for me I click it, it shows it will download 10.10 and then I get 404 on redirect with https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-10.10.0-amd64-netinst.iso

[09:49:18] <somiaj> jochum: so yea guess ~p (priorirty) is not included in apt-patterns yet, but using apt list (not apt search) it works for me, at least I'm better learning how to deal with the patterns in apt, thought aptitude does have more

[10:53:57] <Blondie101010> no but I did ask "why"
[10:54:00] <rando25892> thanks though..
[10:54:31] <rando25892> its in the debian page https://wiki.debian.org/Packaging/SourcePackage
[10:54:45] <Blondie101010> rebuilding implies you know of a good way to make a change that you want, otherwise it's pointless
[10:55:00] <rando25892> pointless?
[10:55:08] <rando25892> why even say that if you dont know what im doing even
[10:55:10] <Blondie101010> why do you want to build it?
[10:55:20] <rando25892> its on the page there
[10:55:58] <Blondie101010> just trying to help
[10:57:35] <rando25892> how would it be pointless if compiling for the system packages for a newer application's version brings compatibility if anything its what linux offers packages from source as binary packages age
[10:57:45] <rando25892> ages*
[10:58:09] <Blondie101010> what would you change in the build to make it more compatible with whatever?
[10:58:24] <Blondie101010> you would simply rebuild it the same way it should already be distributed
[10:58:26] <somiaj> I think the actual problem is shifting, but once you have the source package unpacked and made your changes dbuild, or various tools can build it, I use dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b
[10:58:31] <Blondie101010> so pointless
[10:58:47] <somiaj> note to be more proper your changes should probably be made into a patch via quilt, but if just building a binary package it won't be that big of a deal if not
[10:58:52] <Blondie101010> sure if you have something to change
[10:59:12] <rando25892> change or using a newer/older version
[10:59:15] <somiaj> they did state 'once my editing is ready' so I assume they are changing something
[10:59:51] <rando25892> well no its only the version numbers then ill try to debian source package files and if it didnt work i could just do make manually
[10:59:57] <somiaj> building a different version with the same debian/ dir can be hit or miss, you often have to adjust things for the changes int he software, but if you want to build a newer package not in debian you should look at
[11:00:01] <somiaj> !uupdate
[11:00:01] <dpkg> uupdate (in the <devscripts> package) upgrades a source code package from an upstream revision, or e.g. if the newest foo in debian is 1.2, and upstream is at 1.4: apt-get source foo; wget -nd http://foo.org/foo-1.4.tar.gz; cd foo-1.2; uupdate ../foo-1.4.tar.gz  Ask me about <package recompile>.

[12:31:24] <dpkg> [stable] The status of a Debian release when no packages will be added or version-bumped, and changes will only fix security issues and critical bugs. Packages can be removed in rare circumstances. The current stable version of Debian is Bullseye (11.x); ask me about <releases>. Security bugs are fixed in stable by backporting the fix to the stable version (ask me about <security backports>). https://wiki.debian.org/DebianStable

[12:43:23] <dpkg> Point releases are updates to <stable> and <oldstable>, fixing security & grave bugs. If you track security updates regularly (as you should!) there will often be no updates for you in a point release. Upgrade by referencing a Debian <mirror> in /etc/apt/sources.list, then "apt update && apt full-upgrade". See <9.13> <10.10> (None for bullseye yet). https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases/PointReleases.

[12:44:07] <somiaj> Many many yaers ago now there was talk of debian-cut, which some may have liked, but I think it didn't get much ground just due to the amount of work behind it, stablizing testing is hard enough.

[13:00:17] <somiaj> scythe1: Usually the locale shouldn't be an issue, I'm unsure why tex-common is givving you problem. One solution is to purge your tex packages, and reinstall them, that sometimes fixes things.
[13:00:57] <scythe1> alright
[13:00:58] <somiaj> scythe1: one could dive deeper and try to figure out why text-common and fmtutil is failing, but it might just be easeist to purge and reinstall.

[14:58:41] *** Joins: yuta (~pi@user/yuta)
[14:59:26] <solrize> thanks... is there a reasonable way for me to run an old version?  
[14:59:40] <solrize> i guess i could try to build gcc from source but that sounds like an adventure, building a cross compiler
[15:00:17] <solrize> i could install an old debian on a vm if necessary i guess
[15:00:21] <velix> build gcc from source? :D
[15:00:29] <velix> That's something I've never done before :D
[15:00:37] <velix> I'm using gcc all the time to compile source.
[15:00:41] <solrize> yeah, no idea what kind of shape the msp430 back end is in 
[15:00:42] <velix> but I've never compiled GCC ;)
[15:00:50] <solrize> i've built gcc lots of times but not as a cross compiler
[15:01:13] <solrize> it is kind of a pain because the build system doesn't parallelize very well so it takes about 1/2 hour to build even with tons of cores
[15:01:37] <velix> okay, don't do it on a 48-core Xeon then ;)
[15:01:45] <solrize> it's ok i don't have one ;)
[15:01:54] <solrize> i have a 4 core i7 is that close enough? :)
[15:02:06] <Khepra> solrize: what exactly are you trying to achieve? that package has been gone 4 years ago

[15:50:41] <totenkoph> oh okay
[15:51:07] <PMT> just a thought, I'm no expert, but if you upgraded and it broke, well
[15:51:26] <totenkoph> yeah butt and audacity broke after upgrading
[15:51:42] <PMT> were you using audio packages not from debian?
[15:51:55] <totenkoph> nope
[15:52:22] <PMT> i've got no other bright ideas assuming apt upgrade isn't reporting a bunch of kept back packages
[15:52:45] <totenkoph> no packages are held back..every one of them got upgraded
[15:52:55] <PMT> I can walk you through poking it further, but I do think it's probably reasonable to report that this happened even if you find a way to sort it out.
[15:53:18] <totenkoph> okay ill report this

[19:01:48] <Red_M> Cool
[19:01:56] <xx> "stable" is literally not stable, because from one day to another it can try to upgrade 2k+ packages :p
[19:01:58] <Red_M> You can go tell that to the docker team

[22:43:53] <Razva> @mrfoobar @Khepra I've stated that this is offtopic. If you are not able to give a hint please just ignore the request. I've obviously asked in the "proper places" as well but didn't received any feedback, hence me asking here.
[22:43:55] <greycat> A 404 error is extremely simple.  The thing you asked for isn't there.  If the web site is openly indexed, you can just *go* there and look and see what's actually there.  Maybe there's a typo in your entry.
[22:44:18] <greycat> Otherwise, there's nothing #debian can do for you.  We don't know what the correct entry lines are for other operating systems.
[22:44:19] <Razva> @greycat hey, thanks for the reply. :) Well, the thing is password protected, it seems.

[23:09:09] <greycat> You're not even on *Debian*.  How can anyone here advise you on what works in Ubuntu?  Ask #ubuntu.  And none of us know what "DPI scaling" is apparently.  Have fun, good luck.
[23:10:17] <Razva> @greycat well Debian has DE's. My question was which one should I use. DPI scaling is that thing where you have a 4k screen, everything is tiny, you set it to 200% and voila.
[23:10:33] <Razva> Basically I need something that: 1) allows me to do DPI scaling, as I'm using 1x4k, 1x2k and 1xFHD (yes, it's a potato configuration, I know). 2) works with Nvidia / Lutris.
[23:11:47] <Razva> Historically Debian had issues with both KDE and Gnome regarding DPI scaling, hence users going to Ubuntu / Pop.
[23:12:10] <Razva> But I guess ... well ... you're not using a Debian DE ... ?
[23:12:26] <greycat> I, personally, am not.  I use fvwm.

[23:19:22] <Razva> @Mr_Queue 4k screen, tiny stuff => you use DPI scaling => 200% => WIN.
[23:19:23] <somiaj> the only wayt to figure out if they suit your needs is to test them out, personally I think your info is incorrect, I suspect the gnome/kde in debian has similar features as the same version in other distros

[23:19:28] <greycat> Mr_Queue: earlier, they said it has something to do with 4k monitors.
[23:19:36] <joepublic> For my wife I used xfce; she seems happy with it.  that's one data point.
[23:20:03] <somiaj> DPI scaling is a stpuid way to deal with setting the DPI of the fonts, and actually to me has only made things harder due to desktops wanting to 'simplify' a user just correclty setting the DPI they desire for their resolution
[23:20:44] <somiaj> Basically xft fonts allow you to control the dpi of the fonts, which in turns controls the size of fonts (and thus windows and so forth), so on large resolutions things don't appear to small
[23:20:57] <Mr_Queue> So you need a nvidia or rockem driver... Not sure what DE has to do with any of it.
[23:21:10] <Razva> @joepublic yeah tried that last week, it was a huge pain in the arse to set it up, and after hours of struggling I ended up with some apps working and some apps not working (especially flat/snap).
[23:21:18] <somiaj> dpi scaling is just 'double the dpi' instead of actually setting a number to it, 200% just means 96*2 dpi, since 96 is the hard coded default in most DE's these days
[23:21:43] <joepublic> So, in your experience, xfce is difficult to set up, and snaps and flatpaks don't work with it.  Okay.
[23:21:50] <somiaj> the display driver shouldn't have an effect here, but I guess you have various things that use dpi, personally it should be the fonts/de not the graphcs driver setting this
[23:22:21] <Razva> @joepublic some flatpacks work, for example you can manually fix Spotify. But you have to fix it after each update. Which is a no-go.

[23:24:07] <somiaj> good, I personally use linux because it allows more control and configuration. There are improvements, but most in the direction of mass-adoption take away configuration, control, and add bloat

[23:25:32] <greycat> I hate it when Ubuntu users come here and try to tell us how our operating system isn't good enough.
[23:26:08] <n4dir>  The Fable; from wiki.debian.org is a good one. But whom am i telling that?
[23:26:26] <greycat> haven't seen that one in a while ;-)
[23:26:29] <sney> linux hegemony stopped being the goal a long time ago. the space that free software has carved out for itself is just fine, thanks, and windows and osx have their place too.

[23:31:53] <n4dir> there is fvwm-crystal, said to be something like a DE, but i couldn't make more sense of it than from fvwm itself (but that really is me, says nothing about the WM itself. Very lame with docs)
[23:32:03] <Mr_Queue> I jumped off the linux gui years ago. It's on my servers, it's what I do for work. My daily driver is a MBP.
[23:32:05] <greycat> dpkg, awesome =~ s#http://awesome.naquadah.org/#https://awesomewm.org/#
[23:32:06] <dpkg> greycat: OK
[23:33:18] <Khepra> Mr_Queue: a what now?
[23:33:36] <greycat> Debian users tend to be more conservative and old-fashioned than Ubuntu users, generally.  We're more likely to use a WM than a DE, and more likely to use a plain text console, compared to most other Linux distribution users.
[23:33:38] <Razva> @greycat I'm not a Ubuntu user. :D I'm a Windows and macOS user on PC and MBP, and a Debian CLI user on my small ~20 servers cluster. I just wanted to get my head out of my bubble and see where Linux stands buuuut for now - for my specific use case - I'm sticking with my current setup/s. I wanted to help a coworker that uses his PC mostly with webapps (a TON of webapps, hence his need for 3 monitors) and some basic stuff like Spotify and basic 
[23:33:38] <Razva> text-editing. Anyway, I'm leaving things as they are for now, I'll try Linux DEs again in 2-3 more years, who knows.

[23:39:53] *** Quits: mei (~mei@user/mei) (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
[23:39:53] <Razva> @jhutchins about $100 / year for my family, and that's going towards O365. I also paid $100 two years ago for an app named Rambox Pro.
[23:40:37] <jhutchins> Razva: I take it the Windows licensing is rolled in to the hardware reefresh.
[23:41:49] <Razva> @jhutchins nowadays Windows licensing is a non-issue. In this part of Europe if you buy an entire system (that is CPU + RAM + Mobo) the seller throws in a free Windows license. I don't think that's common in the US but it is in the EU.
[23:42:10] <n4dir> Rambox is a "workspace" browser? And you have to pay for it?
[23:42:14] <xormor> Razva: I am not interested
[23:42:58] <xormor> do I use /ignore or does he move to PM with the ones he wants to talk to? or is there another channel for this? like #debian-offtopic
[23:43:28] <Blondie101010> definitely not debian related :|

[23:44:06] <Razva> Ok
[23:44:18] <Razva> Sorry for the disruption :)
[23:44:29] <jhutchins> xormor: Or just chill a bit and read on.
[23:44:34] <somiaj> Windows license are not free and they aren't just throwing it in, that cost is being made up somewhere.
[23:44:41] <jhutchins> xormor: I consider relative cost topical.
[23:44:42] <Mr_Queue> jhutchins: Uhh, this one is maybe 6 or 7 years old. 2015
[23:44:57] <jhutchins> What somiaj said.
[23:45:49] <jhutchins> Occasionally someone like dell will sell systems without Windows installed, and you can see the price difference.  Microsoft has an incentive to keep the price per unit they charge the manufacturer as low as possible.
[23:46:02] <jhutchins> Mr_Queue: That's good mileage.
[23:46:03] <xormor> jhutchins: I am out of the anti-anxiety agent that I still used last Friday. now I use just the meds that I *need to*, because they are the ones used for chronic treatment. the anti-anxiety agent is used on an "as-needed basis".

[23:46:52] <Mr_Queue> jhutchins: Yep, it's about time for a replacement. The screen is pretty beat up from lots of days and miles in a backpack. But it's still doing it to it.
[23:47:03] <Razva> @somiaj I think we should move this to offtopic. :) But to answer your question, no, Microsoft is offering "almost free" licenses to big hardware sellers. In the last years their income wasn't generated by Windows licensing but from 365, Azure etc. I guess that at some point they'll just throw in licenses on their Microsoft365 plans and that'll be.
[23:47:08] <Razva> sorry for the @ :)
[23:47:19] <Khepra> jhutchins: weren't you few weeks ago annoyed when we talked about programming? so I guess taht doesn't apply when YOU want to talk offtopic? hipocrisy much?
[23:47:55] <somiaj> Though I do agree with Linus that the linux desktop has a major drawback, and that is if someone wants to build software for linux, they often have 10+ distros they have to make packages for, which just complicates and lessons the incentive to target the linux desktop.
[23:48:11] <jhutchins> I bought a refurb laptop a few years ago for around $200.  I added up the cost for licensing the "trial" software I needed and upgrading Windows to Pro so I could join my home network and the total was $600-$800.  I was planning on installing Linux anyway.
[23:48:31] <Razva> jhutchins uh-oh. Are you in US?
[23:48:40] <somiaj> Now I don't know of a good solution to this, and part of what many who use the linux desktop like about it is the variety, but this is why linux desktop isn't as popular as it is for embedded devices, phones, servers, etc
[23:49:04] <Khepra> somiaj: the 2014 debconf talk?
[23:49:13] <somiaj> I think that was it
[23:49:37] <Khepra> I heard there was quite a commotion in some private debian dev mailing lists afterwards, wanted to ban Linus from future debcons, lol.
[23:49:37] <jhutchins> Razva: Yes.  We get the pre-installed Windows on most end-user systems too.
[23:50:17] <jhutchins> Razva: I think Microsoft has changed the fee structures at least once since then.
[23:50:26] <somiaj> Khepra: didn't hear that, but that does sound surprising, maybe linux users just need to realise that desktop is not its strong point for the masses, and that is just fine.
[23:50:43] <Razva> usually in EU everything that's refurb comes with a Windows license even if the device is $100. I guess that MS is not interested in milking money from this and are shifting focus to something "more milkable" :)
[23:51:15] <Khepra> somiaj: it's perfectly fine with me. to me linux always was an expert OS. from developers for developers, and NEVER something for mass consumer... consumption.
[23:51:39] <joepublic> new install on an old thinkpad, after installing firmware-realtek for my rtl 8192, rfkill reports hard blocked: yes even though the machine does not have a hardware block feature
[23:51:49] <Khepra> I use i3-wm because it feels best for me, and like many otehr here, I can't stand the opinionated bloat of a big name DE
[23:51:58] <Blondie101010> yes, their business model was changed to encourage upsell of the various junk they promote on this free advertising platform (win 10)
[23:52:06] <pasiz> i think desktop is many distros best part...
