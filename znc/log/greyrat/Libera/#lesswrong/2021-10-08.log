[00:14:22] <feepbot> 3 Dangers Of Cast Iron (Is Enameled Cast Iron Cookware Safe?) (A cast iron skillet is arguably a traditional cook's best friend! But is there lead or other heavy metals in cast iron? And what about enameled cast iron cookware -- is it safe, especially for pregnant or nursing mothers and children? W [snip])
[00:14:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Unfortunately, the most popular brand of enameled cast iron, Le Creuset, often shows lead and cadmium at very unsafe levels when tested. (Visit Lead Safe Mama for gobs of test results on vintage and modern kitchen items!)
[00:14:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Here is a Le Creuset yellow sauce pan with 19,600 ppm cadmium and 48 ppm lead. And while this one isn't cast iron, right here you can see a Le Creuset Mixing bowl that tested at 40,700 ppm lead!"
[00:14:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> D:
[00:15:20] <gwern> that's surprising. most people these days strongly try to avoid lead
[00:16:55] <gwern> and lodge does better huh
[00:17:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> It seems like the source is whatever they use to make the exteriors of the cookware bright colored

[00:22:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> As usual, can't trust the French
[00:22:23] <kuudes> I wonder where they are made? ie is chinese air that much more leaded etc?
[00:22:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: It can't possibly be the air
[00:22:55] <kuudes> it was the air with lead in the past
[00:22:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Think about how much more leaded the air would have to be to result in *literally three orders of magnitude* more lead in the exterior
[00:23:05] <kuudes> and indeed it was unbelievable even back then
[00:23:29] <kuudes> "not all air can be leaded" "not everyone can be covered in lead all the time" etc
[00:23:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> The air was not *that* leaded
[00:23:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not 40,000 ppm worth of leaded
[00:23:59] <kuudes> gwern, you remember it better than I do? how much was it?
[00:24:58] <gwern> there's certainly a lot of lead floating around but it's hard to see how that's an issue when this blogger links a Lodge at... 40 ppm? vs le creuset at 48 and 40,700 ppm
[00:25:20] <gwern> even if 40ppm is your 'ambient lead level', 40,700 ppm is obviously 'something has gone wrong' levels
[00:25:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: It's much more likely they just use leaded enamel paint: https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/22872/Lead_enamel_paint.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y

[00:41:29] <kuudes> namespace_, oh :-(
[00:42:12] <saturn2> but in terms of exposure, ppm in a tiny enamel chip is much different than ppm in food you eat, which i again much different than ppm in water you drink

[01:03:04] <feepbot> <gwern> 'In contrast to most other work on sparse, or long-range attention (c.f. Section 2), we treat the external memory as a large “cache”, and gradients are not back-propagated into the cache. This is a potential limitation, because it means that the network can only learn to query the external memory, and cann directly learn what keys and values to put into it. However, we
[01:03:04] <feepbot> demonstrate empirically that (key, value) pairs which are useful for local (and thus fully differentiable) self-attention are also useful for long-range attention. Using a non-differentiable cache is critical to scalability. The keys and values are a function of model parameters, so attempting to backpropagate gradients into the external memory would necessarily involve computing
[01:03:04] <feepbot> all of the keys and values with the current model parameters on every training step. If the external memory is not differentiable, we can instead reuse keys and values from prior training steps. With our technique, we are easily able to scale external memory up to a sequence lengths of 131k or 262k tokens on a single device, while maintaining a reasonable step time.'

[03:10:59] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : Re above, I can't immediately disprove that statement
[03:12:42] <Obormot\Gaia> So I was looking into making pizza at home, was googling ready-made sauces... https://www.ragu.com/our-sauces/pizza-sauces/pizza-quick-traditional-sauce/ ... all the reviews are like "this WAS great but with covid I can't find it anywhere!!"
[03:12:54] <feepbot> Pizza Quick Traditional Sauce | RAGÚ® (Use RAGÚ Pizza Quick Traditional Sauce to whip up a quick pizza bagel or french bread pizza. This jar of quick and easy pizza sauce goes with almost any snack!)
[03:13:24] <gwern> hm. so ViT-VQGAN is 1.7b parameters, batchsize 256 trained on 128 'accelerators' (this sounds like OA work, so presumably v100 GPUs - n=2 per V100 sounds possibly too generous but maybe the decoupled training helps), for 500,000 training steps... damn this is going to be expensive to replicate, even if it delivers the best results compared to vqgan/dall-e/etc
[03:13:51] <gwern> (and this is only 256px too)
[03:14:09] <Obormot\Gaia> Then they have another sauce on which is this review:
[03:14:12] <Obormot\Gaia> "This is THE ONLY sauce in market of sauces - pizza or pasta that I can buy. Being a Jain, I don't eat any vegetable that is grown underground. So THANK YOU for the product."
[03:14:24] <Obormot\Gaia> Is this true?? Can Jains not eat stuff grown underground? Why not?!
[03:14:30] <PlanckWalk> "Evolution is the sole way agi will be invented" seems inconsistent with "evolution is intractable".
[03:14:32] <gwern> (sounds like small budget types may be better off for the foreseeable future with diffusion models, which are competitive but cheaper?)
[03:14:53] <gwern> Obormot\Gaia: if I had to guess, digging stuff up kills too many small creatures/insects
[03:15:00] <PlanckWalk> Like, the former says that agi will be invented, and it will be by evolution.
[03:15:20] <gwern> Obormot\Gaia: ah yes, 'The Jain cuisine is completely ovo-lacto vegetarian and also excludes root and underground vegetables such as potato, garlic, onion etc, to prevent injuring small insects and microorganisms; and also to prevent the entire plant getting uprooted and killed.' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jain_vegetarianism

[03:15:32] <feepbot> <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1045330069" />Jain vegetarianism is practiced by the followers of Jain culture and philosophy. It is one of the most rigorous forms of spiritually motivated diet on the Indian subcontinent and beyond.
[03:16:25] <PlanckWalk> Wow.  I had a tabletop RPG character who had a similar diet for the same reason, I didn't know that real people followed such a diet.
[03:16:55] <gwern> 'Jains make considerable efforts not to injure plants in everyday life as far as possible. Jains only accept such violence in as much as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants.[35][36][37] Strict Jains do not eat root vegetables such as potatoes, onions, roots and tubers as they are considered...
[03:17:01] <gwern> ...ananthkay.[23] Ananthkay means one body, but containing infinite lives. A root vegetable such as potato, though from the looks of it is one article, is said to contain infinite lives in it. Also, tiny life forms are injured when the plant is pulled up and because the bulb is seen as a living being, as it is able to sprout.[38][39][40] Also, consumption of most root vegetables involves...
[03:17:07] <gwern> ...uprooting and killing the entire plant, whereas consumption of most terrestrial vegetables does not kill the plant (it lives on after plucking the vegetables or it was seasonally supposed to wither away anyway). Green vegetables and fruits contain uncountable, but not infinite, lives. Dry beans, lentils, cereals, nuts and seeds contain a countable number of lives and their consumption...
[03:17:13] <gwern> ...results in the least destruction of life...Honey is forbidden, as its collection would amount to violence against the bees.[34][41][42] Jain texts declare that a śrāvaka (householder) should not cook or eat at night. According to Acharya Amritchandra's Purushartha Siddhyupaya: And, how can one who eats food without the light of the sun, albeit a lamp may have been lighted, avoid hiṃsā...
[03:17:19] <gwern> ...of minute beings which get into food? — Puruşārthasiddhyupāya (133)[43] Strict Jains do not consume food that has been stored overnight, as it possesses a higher concentration of micro-organisms (for example, bacteria, yeast etc.) as compared to food prepared and consumed the same day. Hence, they do not consume yoghurt or dhokla and idli batter unless they have been freshly set on...

[03:37:34] <catern> ritual taken to its utmost
[03:40:15] <PlanckWalk> Okay, so by sole way it will happen you really meant not possible otherwise, rather than "will happen this way"
[03:40:43] <PlanckWalk> Yeah, that's a reasonable argument.  One I completely disagree with, but at least now I know what you meant :)
[03:42:15] <shawwwn> <3
[03:42:35] <PlanckWalk> I'd make a bet for your $100k against my "public admission that you were right", but I think in the event of me being right the bet would become meaningless anyway.

[03:43:42] <shawwwn> well, I hope to make a real wager, I.e. I will match some millionaire foolish enough to bet me on a 30 year timescale. That sort of thing. Nice retirement package.
[03:43:43] * pompolic barges into discussion
[03:44:01] <pompolic> perhaps the rest read the "no two rationalists can agree to disagree" post
[03:44:17] <shawwwn> Normally I would be happy to take you up on that, based on “I empathize with not having $100k”. But $100k is also persuasive in this case
[03:44:26] <shawwwn> And I am quite willing to pay it in the condition of being wrong
[03:44:27] <PlanckWalk> pompolic: I disagree with it.
[03:44:37] <shawwwn> So I want to think about how to phrase it and present it well.
[03:44:59] <shawwwn> Also, wtf hetzner. The server must be accessed with ipv6 only. “Your server SX64 #1554899 (157.90.213.58) has been activated and is now ready for use. Currently it is booted in the Rescue System. You can access the server via SSH2 using the following details:

[03:46:08] <PlanckWalk> I wonder if you can also access it via 157.90.213.58, which looks suspiciously like an IPv4 address
[03:46:14] <shawwwn> Oh!
[03:46:18] <pompolic> PlanckWalk: i must admit it was a low effort post and i was wholly unprepared for that response
[03:46:19] <shawwwn> Yes, I’m an idiot

[03:47:46] <shawwwn> Now I just need some time to play with it…
[03:48:03] <shawwwn> Or convince saturn2 to play with it
[03:48:51] <PlanckWalk> In this case we can disagree due to differing priors on the possibility of AGI being possible through any mechanism other than evolution.
[03:49:59] <pompolic> i'm actually confused, though, would this not result in mutual updating of priors?
[03:50:08] <PlanckWalk> On what information?
[03:50:18] <pompolic> indeed
[03:50:33] <PlanckWalk> Besides, you can't update from a zero prior.
[03:51:11] <pompolic> true
[03:51:20] <nshepperd> evolution was also the only way a chess grandmaster had ever been made, until it wasn't
[03:51:21] <pompolic> i think that two resolved my confusion
[03:53:42] <PlanckWalk> I'm not sure why "copy what evolution produced in various ways until it works" can't possibly work, which could be a possible future discussion.
[03:54:19] <PlanckWalk> It might not work in a specific 30 year timescale, but I don't see why it can't over (say) a 300 year one.

[06:46:07] <nshepperd2> anyway, steak is cheap, not really worth it
[06:46:21] <gwern> but now you're always going to wonder
[06:46:30] <gwern> you should take at least a few bites so you'll *know*
[06:46:40] <adiabatic> a few bites might not be enough
[06:47:08] <gwern> if a few bites isn't enough to sicken nshepperd2 or even have any perceptible effect, then you can be pretty sure the whole thing was then safe to eat
[06:47:10] <nshepperd2> i could test it on the homeless guy who harrasses people outside of the supermarket
[06:47:41] <adiabatic> thanks for reminding me that there's someone eviller than me, other than jim donald
[06:47:53] <nshepperd2> lol
[06:48:00] <gwern> it's a bad test. because he might feel sick for other reasons or lie to you
[06:48:13] <nshepperd2> true, true

[06:48:32] <gwern> homeless not exactly being famous for their health, non-risktaking, calming diet etc
[06:49:00] <nshepperd2> but that's exactly why he'd probably consider the steak worth the risk
[06:49:32] <gwern> alas. a pretty typical experiment design dilemma: cheap but noisy datapoints, or expensive but low-variance?
[06:49:43] <gwern> you don't have much steak, though, so the answer is probably the latter
[06:50:24] <nshepperd2> rmmh: seems a bit excessive, i can think of worse gifts

[07:01:39] <adiabatic> right
[07:01:43] <rmmh> but I will conspicuously consume $0.10 to not insulate a sous vide container
[07:02:42] <gwern> (I like the idea of insulating because it dumps less heat in my room for the AC to remove, means the wand operates less and is quieter, uses less electricity, etc. but not enough to actually get an insulated container)
[07:03:03] <gwern> (the speedup also sounds nice and hadn't ocurred to me)

[10:13:58] <PapuaHardyNet> the buddhist ideal of enlightenment is very similar to the stoic ideal of equanimity

[10:18:51] <pompolic> so, catholicism of all places?
[10:19:47] <pompolic> i think they kind of abandoned the whole heaven-is-transcendent thing, but they aren't really consistent about it
[10:20:00] <PapuaHardyNet> I thought (based on Yud's works), that heaven is a place of eternal rest... okay that fits
[10:20:14] <PapuaHardyNet> but really, I'm not talking about dying and then attaining it

[10:21:33] <pompolic> i don't remember for sure, but i would guess it applies to heaven too
[10:22:50] <pompolic> i don't think it was originally like that; i'm betting it's a relatively recent adaptation
[10:23:01] <pompolic> and i'm not sure of canonicity
[10:23:36] <pompolic> i'm an atheist but they couldn't help but make systems for me to try to comprehend

[18:08:33] <gwern> you shouldn't take shawwn too seriously. he's extremely far from an expert on genetics, DRL, or AI safety
[18:08:55] <Gurkenglas> gwern, in your collaborations which shawwwn, what does he provide? The comparative devops advantage?
[18:09:10] <adiabatic> and you want to bother with AI safety anyway? if civilization collapses, you'll want to have all your farming know-how squared away before the Internet goes kaput
[18:09:23] <Gurkenglas> He said he gets people into AI, so it seemed worthwhile to evangelize to him
[18:09:25] <gwern> Gurkenglas: he's great at low-level programming, GPU coding, graphics etc
[18:09:58] <gwern> but he knows next to nothing about RL or topics like automlzero or the AI-GAS program or the strengths & weaknesses of evolutionary search etc
[18:10:18] <PapuaHardyNet> adiabatic: I actually don't care about AI safety due to my higher than average confidence in GCC (global civilizational collapse) before agi
[18:10:21] <gwern> after all, he only started DL like 2 years ago and has focused on practical stuff like how to code TPUs
[18:10:45] <adiabatic> PapuaHardyNet: my 'why not farming' question still stands, then
[18:10:48] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, huh. Do you have better reasons than all the other people who expected such over the course of history?
[18:10:51] <gwern> (you can't expect him to match the knowledge of people who have been reading about and debating this for decades and who spend most of their time reading arxiv papers)
[18:11:28] <Gurkenglas> Of course he's allowed to not have been convinced yet before I talk to him :3
[18:11:35] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't bother with AI safety, I enjoy AI stuff and want to play with cutting edge models
[18:13:13] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, if AI safety was important, should you bother with it? If playing with cutting edge models was dangerous in the sense of walking around on the planet while there is an invisible supernova landmine buried somewhere, should you restrain yourself?
[18:13:18] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: look at Rome. All you need is the growth curve to fall sharply enough, and a few good supply chain shocks, and AGI won't be in the lesswrong horizon of 2070.
[18:15:51] <PapuaHardyNet> huh? If I cared about AI safety, there are far more impactful things I could do than not playing with cutting edge models. would I restrain myself? depends on the opportunity cost in terms of resources and autonomy
[18:17:44] <Gurkenglas> Makes sense. After GCC, does most everyone starve?

[18:19:03] <adiabatic> is it self-cleaning
[18:19:06] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: nope, a good definition of GCC would be that the governments cannot ensure a minimum quality of life for their citizens. People with resource will obviously not starve. It is, as usual, the poorest, who will bear the brunt of the suffering
[18:19:20] <rmmh> tl;dr: they have a mutation that makes them not produce DHT, but during puberty the excess T means their internal testes and small phallus develops into a full scrotum and penis
[18:20:01] <rmmh> adiabatic: unclear, presumably it's real shallow, no idea about  flora 
[18:20:19] <gwern> 'When Imperato-McGinley investigated the Guevedoces she discovered the reason they don't have male genitalia when they are born is because they are deficient in an enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase, which normally converts testosterone into dihydro-testosterone. This deficiency seems to be a genetic condition, quite common in this part of the Dominican Republic, but vanishingly rare elsewhere....
[18:20:25] <gwern> ...So the boys, despite having an XY chromosome, appear female when they are born. At puberty, like other boys, they get a second surge of testosterone. This time the body does respond and they sprout muscles, testes and a penis. Imperato-McGinley's thorough medical investigations showed that in most cases their new, male equipment seems to work fine and that most Guevedoces live out their...

[18:21:17] <PapuaHardyNet> good light novel plotline
[18:21:18] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, what if any steps do you challenge in the story: 1. GCC 2. There remain existing GPU farms 3. There remain most existing AI researchers 4. they'll continue improving efficiency until AGI?
[18:21:28] <PapuaHardyNet> tfw your childhood friend becomes a handsome raijuu
[18:21:45] <rmmh> PapuaHardyNet: this is a common anime/hentai plot tbh 
[18:22:11] <rmmh> "My childhood friend that I thought was a boy became a hot girl??" oh that's the reverse
[18:22:22] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: AI winter is one possibility.
[18:22:31] <PapuaHardyNet> but let me answer your question
[18:22:44] <nshepperd2> whaaa
[18:23:46] <PapuaHardyNet> I do think it is possible that with the current infrastructure (and the fact that microprocessor innovation is so crucial to competitiveness) would mean that there will be a lot of GPUs and TPUs out there, and AI research will continue, especially in universities and in corporate research labs
[18:24:01] <rmmh> They're presumably near immune to male pattern baldness too (no DHT) 
[18:24:14] <PapuaHardyNet> however, the progress will not be exponential. The time horizon for AGI will lengthen considerably
[18:24:47] <rmmh> I suspect they have somewhat smaller penises, though? Tradeoffs
[18:24:48] <PapuaHardyNet> this, combined with the fragility of a civilization that is hit with shocks, shall progressively increase the time horizon until it is meaningess to have a time horizon for AGI
[18:25:42] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, progress from software improvements is also exponential, right?
[18:25:51] <PapuaHardyNet> no, see electron and chrome
[18:26:09] <PapuaHardyNet> software improvements have not been the main driver of AI innovation
[18:26:37] <PapuaHardyNet> it has always been the exponential improvement in hardware: tensor computations per power-time
[18:27:00] <PapuaHardyNet> (doesn't power take time into account? if so, replace power-time with power)
[18:27:34] <Gurkenglas> Sounds testable! How much do scaling laws depend on the architecture?
[18:27:55] <Gurkenglas> Does gwern know?
[18:31:00] <rmmh> PapuaHardyNet: did you see that paper on slowing scaling in advancements in various fields?

With too much to read & absorb, papers in more crowded fields are citing new work less, and canonizing highly-cited articles more.’ Images:

[18:35:53] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Wrtp36cbl61 -> Figure 2 shows the scaling of different architectures. How plausible is it that we might find an architecture with better scaling than that, even after GCC?
[18:35:54] <rmmh> PapuaHardyNet: and I'm sure you've been following the recent supply chain fuckery
[18:37:11] <gwern> Gurkenglas: archs typically shift scaling laws by constant factors up/down. changes in the exponents are pretty unusual and noteworthy
[18:37:17] <PapuaHardyNet> rmmh: yeah. this... meta problem of growth actually slowing down progress, that's incredible to see. I hadn't considered it at all
[18:37:50] <rmmh> communication limits scaling in organizations all the time, it's neat that you cna see the same in science 
[18:37:51] <gwern> I didn't read that paper carefully but I don't know if it shows actual absolute slowing, or merely diminishing returns / changes in proportions
[18:39:36] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: you mean a better neural network architecture that would scale even better than SOTA, that we find even after GCC? I don't think we can easily find (as rmmh put it) changes in exponents when it comes to scaling - that would by itself imply that we have some method better than the current one for finding architectures (unless you are relying on luck here)

[18:40:23] <PapuaHardyNet> but uh, where do you get those review papers published
[18:40:57] <PapuaHardyNet> top tier pubs will never accept it. therefore we are stuck in an inadequate equilibrium
[18:42:31] <Gurkenglas> The mechanism by which we discover it later would be serial time required. Which, to be fair, I don't intuitively see much reason for, but then again, I also wouldn't have predicted science slowing down. ( https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/11/26/is-science-slowing-down-2/ )

[18:43:11] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, might GCC might clear out some inadequate equilibria? :P
[18:44:27] <PapuaHardyNet> depends on the domain, but I'm pessimistic about it. lots of inadequate equilibria have a ton of people invested in it. Their career and their livelihoods depend on it
[18:45:40] <gwern> Gurkenglas: but note that that is about diminsihing returns / proportions. it costs a *lot* more to make moore's law go vroom, but the claim is not that it went less vroom each year
[18:47:16] <Gurkenglas> gwern, I would have expected a factor 2 software improvement to not also require a factor 2 effort increase. In fact, that sounds more like what a game designer would do for purposes of balance.
[18:47:40] <gwern> I dunno, most game systems typically build in exponential difficulty curves
[18:47:56] <Gurkenglas> Right! And I wouldn't have expected reality to obey that.
[18:48:00] <gwern> you climb the tech tree, and the last few techs cost more than the previous put together. or you approach the level cap
[18:48:07] <gwern> that's just diminishing returns and power laws etc
[18:48:23] <gwern> each halving of GPT loss costs you like 100x the FLOPs the previous one did or whatever
[18:49:58] <Gurkenglas> Sure. To a first approximation, I would model each year of math eduction to involve the same amount of arbitrary choice, and lead to the same increase in efficiency once that level is unlocked; and then I model that it takes linear time to correctly divine the next arbitrary bit at the frontier
[18:50:32] <Gurkenglas> (-"linear"+"constant per bit")
[18:53:19] <Gurkenglas> I can buy scaling laws being linear on a log-log scale, but a subexponential amount of researcher time becoming another constant-factor increase is, uh, sort of why I buy AGI in the first place

[19:07:57] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, you may be right that it would be a bad idea for me to put that on a CV, given that my ideas for what to put in an application are apparently bad
[19:12:21] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, what's your % on GCC, and at what utility % between paperclips and FAI is the present state of affairs?
[19:16:52] <PapuaHardyNet> Gurkenglas: GCC probability this century imo is ~75%. The present state of affairs is not something I can gauge since I am so used to it.
[19:17:20] * gwern is not a fan of this 'GCC' acronym
[19:18:37] <Gurkenglas> uh. PapuaHardyNet, equivalently: there's a button. You press one, x% chance of FAI, (1-x)% chance of paperclips. At what x are you torn?

[19:20:10] <PapuaHardyNet> 10% FAI I'd be torn
[19:22:17] <Gurkenglas> Would you care about AI safety if a clever scaling laws experiment found that we are 5 years from human-level AI?
[19:23:22] <PapuaHardyNet> I wouldn't care because I am powerless to change things within 5 years. I'd bet that it won't happen and act that way
[19:23:38] <Gurkenglas> Are you powerless in the same way that you are powerless to change the outcome of an election?

[20:30:32] <ainoue> Hello friends
[20:30:49] <feep> hhi
[20:31:02] <feep> wanna watch us play factorio? is it work time there? want to join?
[20:31:27] <ainoue> Would love to watch! In the future may be able to join
[20:31:31] <feep> yay
[20:31:33] <feep> define future
[20:31:37] <feep> hours, days
[20:31:41] <ainoue> Days
[20:31:51] <feep> kaykay
[20:31:58] <ainoue> My time zone is UTC-10, so I tend not to line up with other people haha
[20:32:06] <feep> oh wow yeah
[20:32:21] <adiabatic> everyone else celebrates christmas before you
[20:32:27] <adiabatic> even us on Pacific time
[20:32:31] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: okay, one thing I think you need to change is in config/config.ini set verify-user-identity to false
[20:32:43] <ainoue> Regardless, appreciate the ping and just lmk how to watch
[20:32:45] <adiabatic> …Hawaii? Or someplace even more exotic?
[20:32:48] <ainoue> Hawaii indeed
[20:33:31] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: done
[20:34:10] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: alright, try starting and hosting a multiplayer game?
[20:34:33] <feep> that's multiplayer, host new game, freeplay
[20:34:35] <feep> then post your ip
[20:34:40] <feep> you may need to forward a port, uh
[20:34:58] <feep> 34197 as udp
[20:35:16] <PapuaHardyNet> oh no, port forwarding always messes up for me
[20:35:27] <feep> I'm sure it'll work
[20:40:28] <feepbot> <gwern> https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08603 https://deepmind.com/research/publications/2021/Is-Curiosity-All-You-Need-On-the-Utility-of-Emergent-Behaviours-from-Curious-Exploration

[20:40:53] <feep> why, why have deepmind decided that they are ~blue~
[20:41:02] <pie_>  da ba dee da ba dai
[20:41:45] <pie_> reminds me of a hospital
[20:41:50] <pie_> do not be alarmed you are being rescued
[20:43:05] <feep> the robot has moved my shoes
[20:43:07] <feep> it must be punished
[20:44:07] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: 193.27.14.94, port 55649?
[20:44:48] <feep> aigh
[20:45:05] <PapuaHardyNet> okay that doesn't work
[20:45:16] <feep> can confirm
[20:45:40] <feep> that seems an odd port, are you sure
[20:47:26] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, the problem is that my router is retarded
[20:47:32] <feep> that seems plausible
[20:50:27] <Gurkenglas> Curiosity, hm? I hope they never hook up a curiosity engine to a compiler out of curiosity. ._.
[20:51:19] <feep> you heard about clippy, now get ready for fuzzy
[20:51:32] <pie_> fuzzy actually sounds good
[20:51:37] <pie_> clippy would be like
[20:51:48] <pie_> did you mean abstractsingletonproxyfactorybean
[20:53:02] <Gurkenglas> The point isn't that the curiosity engine takes over the universe. The point is that it that it leads to superhuman play at the task of breaking of seals and opening of gates.
[20:53:14] <Gurkenglas> We shouldn't be trying to invent a better Lovecraft protagonist!
[20:55:17] <Gurkenglas> send it to explore the tomb of amon-ket, and if it survives, we can talk.
[20:56:59] <rmmh> feep: have you tried Dyson Sphere Program? 
[20:58:17] <feep> rmmh: no, but I will~
[20:58:18] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: ping?
[20:58:45] <rmmh> no multi-player but it lets you role play a von Neumann swarm 
[20:58:46] <feep> ahahaha
[20:58:54] <feep> halfway through the cleaning, my roomba got very confused
[20:59:05] <feep> I'm looking at my room map rn and it contains two 180° rotated copies of my apartment
[20:59:34] <Gurkenglas> you'd think the software would notice that
[20:59:38] <feep> apparently it thinks it's parked in an apartment across the road?
[20:59:53] <feep> kind of adorable honestly
[20:59:58] <feep> Gurkenglas: the map-following logic was patched in late
[20:59:59] <PapuaHardyNet> erm, I think I destroyed my internet infra (curl isn't working lmao)
[21:00:06] <feep> fun fun
[21:01:48] <PapuaHardyNet> oh it was just resolv.conf that didn't have a nameserver
[21:02:03] <PapuaHardyNet> sorry feep, I'm unable to get a working port forwarded.
[21:02:30] <feep> how does that fail
[21:02:57] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: hang on, easy solution, you gave me a ssh target, right?
[21:03:10] <feep> is that a reasonably direct con-- hang on, no, ssh forward is only tcp
[21:03:39] <PapuaHardyNet> let me try
[21:04:28] *** Quits: oxide (~lambda@user/oxide) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[21:04:34] <PapuaHardyNet> oh yeah, ngrok only supports tcp tunnels
[21:04:45] <PapuaHardyNet> (and http and tls but we don't care about them)
[21:07:09] <PapuaHardyNet> it's all right, I don't think it is possible. I assume I needed to host so we are building it all on a savefile in my system. There's no need for that afaik, I barely play video games - you could host it instead. if not, its fine, let's forget about it

[21:10:19] <PapuaHardyNet> although yes, it's pretty crazy. udp + ngrok 
[21:10:21] <feep> also apparently udp2raw can't do reverse connections so we'd have to go Full OpenVPN
[21:10:27] <PapuaHardyNet> ooh

Requests with Facebook browser (User Agent) We see about 30% of a typical request rate hitting us. But it's not zero; why is that? We'll let you know a little secret. Never trust User-Agent information; it's broken.
[22:35:40] <feepbot> User-Agent spoofing is everywhere. Browsers, apps, and other clients deliberately change the User-Agent string when they fetch pages from the Internet to hide, obtain access to certain features, or bypass paywalls (because pay-walled sites want sites like Facebook to index their content, so that then they get more traffic from links). Fortunately, there are newer, more secure, and

If you drop off, the knife will
[23:58:43] <feepbot> stab you awake and you continue reading. One of his fellow judges that year, novelist Candia McWilliam, recounted in her memoir that she went blind with blepharospasm, a condition in which the sufferer cannot open their eyes, immediately after finishing the Booker reading. Correlation, of course, is not the same as causation; either way, her condition had to be carefully covered up
[23:58:43] <feepbot> at the prize dinner. “The hilariousness of a blind judge for a literary prize already buffeted by vulgar attention might have done an indignity to the prize or its sponsors,” she wrote.'
