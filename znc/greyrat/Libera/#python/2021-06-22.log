[09:11:38] <Midnite> Hi, I'm new to working with the re (regular expression) module. How do I do something (e.g. print) with the matched character(s), if any? I
[09:12:16] <Midnite> I've searched the documentation with Ctrl+F and actually began reading it all, but so far no luck
[09:12:28] *** Joins: pnoud (~pnoud@user/pnoud)
[09:12:31] <DaPinkOne> Midnite, are you looking to print the captured pattern?
[09:12:49] <Midnite> DaPinkOne: exactly. not sure of the syntax
[09:13:19] <DaPinkOne> Midnite, the first code example using m.group may do what you're looking for https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html
[09:15:12] <DaPinkOne> there're several options for the group/match parameters, all on this page

[09:39:41] <Midnite> I could use some pointers on a program I'm working on. It's very short. Please see lines 55 and 57: https://bpa.st/IMDA
[09:40:58] <euouae> What are you trying to do when matching against two digits?
[09:41:04] <Midnite> I'm new to Python, so I don't know a lot of the basics in regards to syntax. Hopefully my semantics are decent
[09:41:17] <Midnite> euouae: trying to return the associated key (type of credit card)
[09:41:24] <Midnite> for that value
[09:41:37] <matsaman> euouae: I'd check that each are the type you think they are [print(type(foo))], and each are a value you're semi-expecting (print(foo))
[09:41:43] <Midnite> so just the string e.g. 'MASTERCARD'

[09:42:51] <Midnite> so the user inputs "54123456789012" and that should print out "MASTERCARD"
[09:43:05] <euouae> Why?
[09:43:18] <matsaman> Midnite: for example: 33 == '33' # False
[09:43:26] <Midnite> matsaman: that was what I feared
[09:43:39] <matsaman> if it's that, it's a pretty simple thing =)
[09:43:39] <Midnite> should I convert them both to ints, or is there a more Pythonic way?
[09:43:46] *** Joins: lucerne (~lucerne@ip202.ip-51-178-215.eu)
[09:43:53] <Midnite> convert == cast

[09:45:31] <Midnite> in the VALID_CARDS those are ints

[09:45:39] <Midnite> let me just make those strings and that'll make this all much easier

[12:37:36] <cecep> Hi all. I'm trying to split my code into many small functions/methods rather than a couple of big ones to make testing easier and it seems to be generally recommended to code this way. I was wondering: how small should func/methods get? Like, would you make a function that only opens and returns a file, for example? Is there a good way to decide how to split them up?

[13:48:45] <susam> p-i-: If it still shows anaconda, then inspect your PATH variable. echo $PATH. Maybe the anaconda path is before /usr/local/bin?

[13:49:57] <jasiek> is there a way to display, for each coroutine in a running program what it is awaiting for?

[14:06:43] <vicecea> hi, I've been considering sharing a python module between different python scripts in different directories by symlinking the module-dir next to the scripts - is there a problem with this approach I should know of? - i.e. does python have edge cases following symlinks to resolve imports?

[14:14:17] <Nalt> That works. It's unfortunate that it works differently in Python. Where do I learn the python version
