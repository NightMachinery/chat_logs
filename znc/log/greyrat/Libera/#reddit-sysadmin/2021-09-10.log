[01:50:46] <Activ8> to test what out synapse
[01:50:46] <xe0n> mIRC is fine!
[01:50:46] <mistiry> idk anything about adiirc. mirc is a good start for a newbie, as i mentioned.
[01:50:46] <Activ8> if you go to the demo and then just put this channel name in you will connect within 2 seconds
[01:50:46] <mistiry> hexchat is pretty easy, too.
[01:50:46] <mistiry> hey xe0n!
[01:50:46] <xe0n> morning :D
[01:50:46] <ender> hexchat's fine, I use it on Linux
[01:50:46] <ender> still prefer adiirc on windows
[01:50:46] <signofzeta> I use Weechat, if you're into text-mode stuff for this text-mode chat.

[01:54:46] <Activ8> synapse I don't know much about mirc never used it myself over a proxy
[01:54:48] <sd> 08<S​ynapse> OpenVPN
[01:55:01] <iphone> also, when you get on libera, the FIRST thing you shoulud do is join #libera-cloak so we can't see your IP

[01:55:49] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> How do I buy an OpenVPN
[01:55:54] <ender> also, your host is hidden by default IIRC

[01:56:13] <sd> 08<S​ynapse> As I say,
[01:56:14] <Activ8> nope you need to request a cloak in #libre

[01:56:49] <sd> 06<A​da> haven't you been asking about irc for like 10 minutes

[01:57:50] <mistiry> should not have issues connecting from a VPN. many people connect from a VPN, or use a VPS.
[01:58:05] <mistiry> you will also need to register your nickname before you can chat in the channel
[01:58:15] <mistiry> use '/msg NickServ help' for help on that
[01:58:26] <sd> 08<S​ynapse> alright.
[01:58:31] <sd> 08<S​ynapse> I appreciate the support.

[02:00:51] <ender> IIRC, it's safer to use /nickserv than /msg nickserv or /ns - the first one'll use server support directly (which helps if somebody manages to take the nickserv nickname)
[02:02:16] <mistiry> wat?
[02:02:42] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> or tell your ircd admin to not be a doofus
[02:02:44] <Activ8> is there not an official list of banned usernames that can be used on irc
[02:02:59] <sd> 12<p​arismillyteri> Depends on daemon and config I think
[02:03:04] <Activ8> ah
[02:03:05] <ender> yeah
[02:03:06] <mistiry> there is no irc server command 'nickserv', in your client thats something they add custom
[02:03:17] <mistiry> banned nicknames are bassed on the ircd config
[02:03:23] *** Quits: vinrock (~vinrock@user/vinrock) (Quit: Fart)
[02:03:33] <ender> /nickserv is just shorthand for /quote nickserv
[02:03:44] <mistiry> also known as "juped" nicknames
[02:04:19] <mistiry> 1.) that is client-specific and 2.) /quote sends raw data to the server, none of which i know of have any sort of built-in nickserv command

[05:31:57] <Work-BWMerlin> What I am trying to do is make a configuration profile that will name the computer CompanyCode-%serialnumber%, join it to the domain, add a local admin account, upgrade the Windows edition to education edition and enrol it into our MDM
[05:32:08] <enix> Like $100/cpu, probably less for you
[05:32:09] <xe0n> oh fuck serial numbers for host names
[05:32:10] <xe0n> gross
[05:32:11] <Telgareith> I've got v0 2670's in it
[05:32:21] <enix> why upgrade then

[05:33:53] <Telgareith> I'm not doing a janky hack to get drivers working
[05:34:07] <xe0n> then buy new hardware
[05:34:09] <xe0n> lol
[05:34:14] <enix> I mean I installed ESX 7 on an optiplex 9040
[05:34:21] <enix> Without janky hacks
[05:34:31] <enix> Just factory install. I would be surprised if 2670's dont work

[05:39:20] <Telgareith> or proxmox instead of esxi
[05:39:22] <Telgareith> idk
[05:39:27] <Telgareith> I'm still trialing proxmox
[05:39:28] <enix> Well, yeah
[05:39:39] <enix> Depends what you want to get out of it but proxmox is pretty great
[05:39:48] <enix> It's a different kind of hypervisor but for home it shouldn't matter
[05:40:02] <enix> I run proxmox on my dl360 and it's been stable as fuck
[05:40:05] <Telgareith> I'm aware
[05:40:21] <Telgareith> I need to passthrough something and beat it to death
[05:40:21] <enix> just do it man
[05:40:23] <JollyRgrs> i run 3 proxmoxes at home, r410, and a pair of r710
[05:40:25] <JollyRgrs> works fine
[05:40:43] <enix> saves fucking with whatever licensing shit you're dealing with for vmware
[05:40:46] <JollyRgrs> i passthrough PCIE for NICs on my opnsense VM
[05:41:18] <Telgareith> enix: idk, every time I get a new license it comes with nice chiptunes.
[05:41:29] <xe0n> i thought you used vmware lol
[05:41:49] <Telgareith> me?
[05:41:56] <Telgareith> the machine is ESXi atm
[05:42:11] <Telgareith> I'm trialing proxmox because 7 won't run on it

[05:44:02] <enix> Yeah the hd drivers in windows is a bit shit
[05:44:49] <enix> But that's a Windows desktop thing. If you roll server, promxox works
[05:45:28] <enix> Desktop you need to sideload in specific drivers and configure the disks in a certain way. I dropped all my doco I had on that because I decided to go ESX for business and I'm not going to be running desktop Windows virtualized at home
[05:45:55] <Telgareith> damn
[05:46:09] <enix> xe0n: no, I dropped esx on d-day and rolled proxmox because I couldn't get the network working
[05:46:23] <JollyRgrs> yeah, srsly, are you trying to do the whole gpu passthrough to game on a VM deal?
[05:46:32] <Telgareith> no
[05:46:33] <JollyRgrs> b/c i can tell you no matter how someone says "i got it to work"... it is bad ideas
[05:46:35] <JollyRgrs> ok
[05:46:38] <xe0n> loll

[05:47:16] <enix> urgh um
[05:47:21] <enix> okay..
[05:47:23] <Telgareith> but I'm thinking about just installing samba on proxmox

[05:47:48] <JollyRgrs> yeah... lol
[05:47:59] <JollyRgrs> if you take storage seriously, WHYTF would you try this jankyass setup?
[05:48:00] <enix> yeah i considered that for about 12.3 seconds
[05:48:02] <Telgareith> it's worked fine in esxi for years
[05:48:06] <enix> and this is /me/ we're talking about
[05:48:16] <Telgareith> I'm trying to dejank it
[05:48:38] <JollyRgrs> sure, i mean i ran freenas as a VM on a box with a dell perc (in dell raid) just fine (while I trialed it)
[05:48:43] <JollyRgrs> doesn't mean I should keep running it like that
[05:48:43] <enix> lsi controller leading to the 24 disks in the chassis?
[05:48:50] <Telgareith> yea
[05:48:51] <JollyRgrs> dejanking means not doing a VM with LSI passthrough
[05:48:51] <enix> I'm kinda seeing what you're doing
[05:48:58] <enix> I dont get why you want to run wwin 7 as a vm tho
[05:49:03] <JollyRgrs> ^^ that, too
[05:49:04] <Telgareith> not win7
[05:49:08] <Telgareith> idk where ya'll got that

[05:50:44] <enix> Telgareith: maybe bite the bullet on x99 and lga2011-3
[05:50:46] <JollyRgrs> i have 3 servers... 1 for most VMs, one for freenas (Baremetal) and one for opnsense and Home Asssistant (smart home)... might move unifi controller to it eventually as well

[05:51:23] <Telgareith> I currently have two baremetal freenas installs that hold my data
[05:51:27] <enix> Telgareith: you'll get esx support up to 8, and you'll be able to continue running what your'e doing
[05:51:40] <enix> you also don't have to relearn something that's not going to apply to your career
[05:51:46] <enix> Well, learn, rather
[05:52:14] * xe0n chucks JollyRgrs a Dr Pepper
[05:52:15] <Telgareith> ESXi doesn't apply much to my career right now either
[05:52:15] <xe0n> cheers bro!
[05:52:27] <enix> Telgareith: and proxmox won't apply anything to your career ever
[05:52:34] <Telgareith> and I'm more and more cloud centric
[05:52:58] <JollyRgrs> Cheers xe0n!
[05:53:03] <Telgareith> upshot is proxmox, I can run my ZFS pools bare metal

[05:53:11] <xe0n> mmmmmmm
[05:53:17] <xe0n> ohhh i had brown cream soda last weekend
[05:53:22] <enix> Telgareith: just make sure your lsi controller presents the raw disk to your os
[05:53:25] <xe0n> and my friend was like ohhh shitt brown cream soda, i havent had this in years
[05:53:26] <xe0n> she loved it
[05:53:42] <enix> *any* interference will kill your zfs pool
[05:53:46] <JollyRgrs> xe0n: BROWN cream soda?
[05:53:50] <xe0n> YES
[05:53:51] <JollyRgrs> whassat?
[05:53:57] <Telgareith> i'm aware
[05:53:59] <xe0n> https://www.schweppes.com.au/products/brown-cream-soda/
[05:54:05] <enix> cool. just reminding
[05:54:06] <Telgareith> that's why its passed through atm
[05:54:12] <enix> true
[05:54:16] <xe0n> Enjoyed by Australians for generations, Schweppes Traditionals Brown Cream Soda is a true taste sensation. With a deliciously creamy flavour enhanced by notes of smooth vanilla, it always delivers the great taste it has become famous for.
[05:54:17] <enix> again, just reminding
[05:54:18] <Telgareith> so I avoid ESXI RDM
[05:54:23] <xe0n> i'll have to send you some mannn
[05:54:25] <xe0n> you'll love it
[05:54:33] <JollyRgrs> A&W cream soda is brownish... some of the "specialty" cream sodas are clear...

[06:05:12] <xe0n> I have four machines (1 HP ProBook 4340s and 3 x Dell Latitude 3380) with the ProBook running Windows 10 Education 1607 Build 14393 and the Latitude's running Windows 10 Education 21H1 Build 19043.1052
[06:05:21] <xe0n> here's an idea Work-BWMerlin....get your base image standandised...
[06:05:25] <xe0n> so you can errr get a consistent test bed
[06:05:26] <xe0n> lol
[06:05:34] <xe0n> 1607 LOL
[06:05:36] <xe0n> fuck man
[06:05:45] <JollyRgrs> 1607?@?@?@?@
[06:05:46] <xe0n> no wonder you're getting inconsistent results.
[06:05:48] <xe0n> LOL
[06:05:48] <Work-BWMerlin> Mac school remember, had to dig to find these
[06:06:01] <xe0n> so? rebuild the machines so they've got the same fucking image
[06:06:06] <xe0n> then you can do testing
[06:06:09] <xe0n> and hopefully get consistent results..
[06:06:10] <JollyRgrs> consistency
[06:06:16] <JollyRgrs> it'll make or break you 100 times over
[06:06:28] <Work-BWMerlin> Well I do, it consistently fails on 21H1
[06:06:43] <Work-BWMerlin> The three dells all get the exact same result
[06:06:45] <Work-BWMerlin> Boot loops
[06:06:48] <xe0n> ....

[06:07:07] <xe0n> 21h1 is what you want to resolve the issues on..
[06:07:09] <JollyRgrs> if you are getting Kellog's Boot Loops, I hope it at least comes with a toy in the box

[06:07:14] <xe0n> LOLLOL
[06:07:21] <xe0n> +++
[06:07:52] <JollyRgrs> so you are going straight from 1607 to 21h1?
[06:08:01] <Work-BWMerlin> JollyRgrs the error is that the profile will do the edition upgrade, reboot, do the local admin and then say "failed" for join to ad, rename computer and enrol in MDM
[06:08:04] <JollyRgrs> i thought you could only go 1903 or above to 21h1

[06:10:04] <JollyRgrs> is it missing bootldr?

[06:12:50] <Work-BWMerlin> The 1607 I did a full clean reset

[11:47:26] <BWMerlin> The Dell's still fail
[11:47:30] <BWMerlin> WTF
[11:47:47] <BWMerlin> They are all made from the same Windows 10 Media creation USB
[11:47:54] <BWMerlin> All use the same profile USB
[11:50:33] <Cl0udNinja> BWMerlin, make sure you are plugging the usb into the correct usb port
[11:50:52] <Cl0udNinja> some dells have a specific port for kvm stuff that does not work for usb booting
[11:51:15] <BWMerlin> The system has boot, it is on the "select region" screen after a fresh install
[11:51:31] <BWMerlin> The install is from the media creation tool so no customisation etc

[12:51:40] <BWMerlin> What is your problem awmv?
[12:53:02] <Jay-Ros> yeah you kinda worded that, like, in a really weird way
[12:53:15] <awmv> There is a VM. If you establish an rdp connection to another device from that vm, you get a data encryption error. It only happens from that vm. rdp connections from other devices or vms to the given server work fine. one collegue of mine thinks driver updates on the server we want to connector to might solve everything
[12:53:16] <Jay-Ros> you got a problem with windows install not detecting drivers or somethin'?
[12:53:40] <awmv> I just want to check if im thinking wrong
[12:54:55] <Jay-Ros> oh is that the registry hotfix issue?
[12:55:14] <awmv> The server runs windows 10 pro. Dell deosn't offer corresponding driverpacks for a client os. I just want to know if drivers can have an influence on rdp connections. I guess that's what I want to know
[12:56:31] <Jay-Ros> the driver shouldn't have an impact
[12:56:56] <Kiernian> I mean, in theory a really bad driver could be missing something necessary for the handshake to occur, or have a b0rked version of a network protocol
[12:57:00] <Kiernian> but yeah, shouldn't be a driver
[12:57:10] <awmv> Thank you!
[12:57:39] <BWMerlin> I am also going with it shouldn't be a driver issue
[12:57:43] <BWMerlin> What is the exact error?
[12:57:43] <Kiernian> compare HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\TermService\Parameters on a working machine with the one that doesn't work.
[12:57:57] <BWMerlin> Might have an encryption standard mismatch
[12:58:18] <BWMerlin> There was a credssp issue last year or so with an patch that got rolled out
[12:58:26] <Jay-Ros> I'd say it's the basic error with kiernian's issue
[12:58:37] <Kiernian> NLA is my guess
[13:00:03] <Jay-Ros> OMFG i just powered on an old-ass laptop, it's a dell e5440...and windows popped up with a toaster alert
[13:00:20] <Jay-Ros> the sound that came out of it was like the crappy speakers were at 200%

[16:10:01] <arkanoid> I'm not finding an easy way to filter them. I end up with that list of quicksync enabled cpus on intel website, but from there I'm not finding any server capable of mounthing those
[16:10:05] <Hunterkll> it's just a dedicated hardware encoder on the CPU core even - not really a 'primary' feature of the iGPU 
[16:10:05] <sd> 13<C​olour> I got a 5675c with quicksync but it's prolly not up to date, I read somewhere once that more up to date CPUs have better quicksync
[16:10:18] <Hunterkll> arkanoid: most of them are embedded system skus or workstation system skus

[16:38:03] <sd> 13<C​olour> Particles from space turning an enemy into an ally in Perfect Dark, and letting me create the Default Character in Oblivion, are the best tho.
[16:39:00] <Hunterkll> ECC memory controllers/builds/ram parts needed, at a pure component cost level, are ~15% or so more expensive 
[16:39:16] <Hunterkll> and, like i said, they're just by nature of the technology slower 
[16:39:32] <Hunterkll> ECC DDR4-2933 will perform slower than non-ECC of the same speed
[16:39:42] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> Not that much slower though.
[16:40:03] <Hunterkll> i mean, it can make a difference with how shit like modern games run though 
[16:40:06] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> I have ECC RAM in my gaming PC at home, and it's just fine.
[16:40:25] *** Joins: sintax (~sintax@user/sintax)
[16:40:26] <Hunterkll> like the difference between 59fps (causing you to vsync down to a lower speed) vs 61fps 
[16:40:37] <Hunterkll> which then you'd be able to vsync to 60fps just fine
[16:41:17] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> Yeah, but that's usually limited by the graphics card which has its own RAM.
[16:41:21] *** Joins: Roughy (~mdaw45ns@user/roughy)
[16:41:26] <Hunterkll> not really
[16:41:35] <Hunterkll> i'm talking about system ram performance choking
[16:41:44] <Hunterkll> which is/was more pronounced on AMD systems, but still
[16:41:59] <Hunterkll> and there's a lotta CPU bound games out there
[16:42:22] <Hunterkll> long and short of it though is that the extra cost just isn't justified for 99% of home users 
[16:42:31] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> Fair enough.

[16:43:32] <Hunterkll> heh, like i said, i wish i could use non-ECC memory
[16:43:40] <Hunterkll> but if i do i think my board is limited to 48GB 
[16:43:46] <Hunterkll> instead of 1.5TB max
[16:43:57] <Hunterkll> unbuffered ECC i think it's limited to 128GB 
[16:44:06] <sd> 12<p​ublic static void ahendrix() {}> That's a pretty big difference.

[16:45:33] <Hunterkll> so yea, i could use cheaper ram, but i'd be cutting myself off at the knees and like, reducing my ram by 60% or so 
[16:45:43] <Hunterkll> 384GB right now
[16:45:46] <Hunterkll> going to 128GB would hurt

[16:46:19] <Hunterkll> though my desktop has 128 now, but I could flip it up to 256 of non-ECC if i wanted to

[16:46:43] <ender> that reminds me of something from another channel: unrelated: does any of you have issues with chrome failing to load the pdf plugin if you have ~1k tabs with a few dozen pdfs mixed in open, or is it just me?
[16:47:21] <sintax> just you

[20:27:14] <Hunterkll> getting my amazon card dind't change how much shit i bought from amazon every month 
[20:27:22] <Activ8> wouldn't be so bad if you were buying for someone else to get the money back then % back on spend lol
[20:27:23] <Hunterkll> but it did lower my spending by 5% 
[20:27:27] <Activ8> i.e build a pc for someone
[20:27:31] <Hunterkll> ya i do that for people sometimes lol

[20:28:20] <Hunterkll> i'll also pop 0% financing offers for big spending instead of just paying for it outright

[20:31:59] <Hunterkll> shit let it chill in savings & get that meager interest if thats all you know how to do

[20:32:06] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:33:08] <corn266> ew
[20:33:17] <corn266> why would you want to lose money to inflation
[20:33:31] <Hunterkll> it's still better than paying off a 0% loan early.....
[20:34:40] <corn266> is it though? your return on a 0% loan is... 0%, but the buying power of the money in that loan loses return to inflation
[20:34:56] <Hunterkll> corn266: huh?
[20:35:04] <Hunterkll> corn266: this is you *taking out* a 0% interest loan
[20:35:06] <Hunterkll> not you giving it to someone
[20:35:17] <Hunterkll> like cellphone payment plans, promotional financing, etc 
[20:36:03] <Hunterkll> you're an idiot to pay those off early when you could take the money to do something more productive and earn more money with it
[20:36:16] <Hunterkll> or at the worst case, pay down debt that has an interest rate that isn't 0% 
[20:36:51] <corn266> well, the purchasing power of the money tied up in the loan is lost to inflation. but letting it sit in your savings is worse because you could be investing it
[20:37:14] <corn266> opportunity cost or whatever
[20:37:16] <Hunterkll> see, but that purchasing power is lost *to the co mpany that gave you the loan*
[20:37:18] <Hunterkll> not to you
[20:37:28] <corn266> you're right
[20:37:36] <Hunterkll> so it's stupid to pay them off early
[20:37:43] <Hunterkll> and i said instead, if it was money you had to buy the item outright
[20:37:50] <Hunterkll> it's smarter to invest or just park it somewhere interest bearing
[20:37:54] <Hunterkll> and accept the 0% loan
[20:37:57] <Hunterkll> than to buy outright or pay off early
[20:38:17] <Hunterkll> also note the thing on the savings account comment: "if thats all you know how to do"
[20:38:20] <corn266> i think we agree on that part, i just think it's stupid to park it in a savings account
[20:38:25] <corn266> oic
[20:38:30] <Hunterkll> you missed the last part of that

[22:11:31] <layer8> iphone meant: "why not move to centos stream silhouette "
[22:11:45] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> stream isn't behind rhel anymore like centos used to be
[22:11:48] <silhouette> iphone: because it's not the same distribution
[22:11:59] <silhouette> it's more upstream than fedora
[22:12:00] <Hunterkll> @HurdyGurdyBurdy CentOS was never behind
[22:12:05] <Hunterkll> it was supposed to be 1:1 down to security patches
[22:12:14] <Hunterkll> like, within hours of security patch hitting RHEL it was in CentOS
[22:12:15] <iphone> I thought it was fedora -> stream -> rhel 
[22:12:39] <Hunterkll> they were behind in releases often because of debranding efforts, but once CentOS X was out, it tracked 1:1 with RHEL
[22:12:41] <silhouette> anyway, i know some of the rocky linux people and interact with em regularly.
[22:12:50] <silhouette> so there's a lvl of trust
[22:13:22] <iphone> times are a-changin
[22:13:29] <silhouette> gregory kurtzer, the current head of rocky, started centOS in the first place
[22:13:31] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> what's their plan for 2-3 years down the line? I'm mostly concerned about loss of funding or something causing them to no longer maintain
