[03:02:45] <LibertyDillo> I have no interest in his opinions of me or any other matter ;)
[03:03:04] <Bakunin> murthy : you might be unfamiliar with this, but for the past 12 hours, off and on, he, morf, and louipcD have been calling everyone and everything "morons"
[03:03:15] <Bakunin> and "retards"
[03:03:23] <LibertyDillo> and we should probably leave politics and religion out of here ;)
[03:03:33] <Bakunin> it's the current channel dynamic, I guess, except now, that you say it's bad, and they will arbitrarily obey you
[03:03:56] <LibertyDillo> although music can of course deal with both
[03:04:21] <Bakunin> If you show up some place where everyone is swearing, and swearing at you, making a point to swear at you, then you swear, and they yell at you for swearing
[03:04:25] <LibertyDillo> but I'd rather deal with good tunes :)
[03:04:28] <Bakunin> it's just insular jackassery
[03:04:51] <louipcD> the current channel dynamic is to call Bakunin a retard as he is
[03:04:52] <murthy> Bakunin: I don't know about others but what you saw about morf is an act :) he does this sometimes for our pleasure
[03:05:00] <louipcD> and for him to tell people to kill themselves or others
[03:05:05] <Bakunin> I mean, no
[03:05:19] <Bakunin> he actually was quite descriptive, so I'm doing an impression of his psychology
[03:05:29] <Bakunin> it just seems offputting when a different nick types it, to your mind
[03:05:40] <murthy> Bakunin: morlog is op here, if you find people abusing you, complaint to him
[03:05:46] <louipcD> and for bakunin to post bullshit that has no relation to music
[03:05:49] <Bakunin> if it really bothered you, you'd be speaking to the culture about it, rather than the new individual imitating the culture

[04:02:12] <morlog> just got all my batteries charged
[04:02:15] <louipcD> oh didnt knew they made much heat
[04:02:21] <LibertyDillo> I've got a synth DAW rig
[04:02:37] <LibertyDillo> not much at all, maybe 30-40 watts
[04:02:39] <morlog> I've got gas
[04:02:45] <louipcD> okhehe
[04:02:55] <louipcD> gas is good for heating
[04:03:01] <louipcD> give it to LibertyDillo 
[04:03:07] <LibertyDillo> MORLOG IS GOING TO FART!!  Everybody run!
[04:03:08] <morlog> what, 30 to 40 watts with a synth
[04:04:00] <LibertyDillo> and a rack of synth modules
[04:04:12] <LibertyDillo> think that's about what they do each
[04:04:31] <LibertyDillo> seems to be working
[04:04:41] <morlog> I would think they would use more
[04:04:56] <morlog> like 80 or 90
[04:05:54] <morlog> looks like I got back home just in time
[04:06:10] <LibertyDillo> 38W for my Prologue, just checked
[04:06:19] <morlog> started raining heavy just at now
[04:06:24] <LibertyDillo> depends on the synth of course
[04:06:35] <louipcD> i guess people need to music harder
[04:06:36] <LibertyDillo> yeah the rain isn't over just yet
[04:06:55] <louipcD> so then they will need more music processing power
[04:07:19] <louipcD> then someone will invent a crypto to use the music power for mining
[04:07:29] <louipcD> and the price of music cards will go thru the roof

[21:16:25] <morf> we had snow today, but it was melting pretty quickly, it's not that cold
[21:16:41] <nativetexan> wow cool
[21:16:53] <morf> otherwise it looks like mild winter so far
[21:17:07] <morf> last year was already freezing like for a month 
[21:17:17] <morf> and it was fucking cold until may 
[21:17:27] <nativetexan> unfortunately in Houston, we don't see much snow
[21:17:27] <morf> fucking gross 
[21:17:50] <morf> would not miss it :) 
[21:18:01] <nativetexan> it typically snowed a few times a year in Dallas
[21:18:16] <nativetexan> and certainly in Amarillo
[21:18:26] <morf> you have some mountains there or not?
[21:18:43] <morf> texas is pretty flat isn't it?

[21:19:16] <morf> that's nice af
[21:19:24] <nativetexan> but on the east side of texas, there's a lot of pine trees
[21:19:38] <morf> oh wait
[21:19:49] <morf> that was in history, texas is not that big now 
[21:19:59] <nativetexan> lol
[21:20:07] <morf> stupid wikipedia
[21:20:56] <nativetexan> unfortunately, wiki has become corrupt, as all human things i 'spose
[21:21:22] <morf> what do you mean? 
[21:21:34] <morf> with PC? 
[21:22:23] <nativetexan> famous wiki people have been edited by wiki, removing certain paragraphs and such
[21:22:38] <morf> yeah well 
[21:22:46] <nativetexan> shit happens
[21:22:53] <morf> it's still pretty great 
[21:23:21] <morf> actually
[21:23:38] <morf> they didn't answer any of my job applications so
[21:23:43] <morf> THEY FUCKING SUCKS BALLS
[21:23:45] <morf> :)
[21:23:49] <nativetexan> do you think wiki is as accurate as the police?
[21:24:02] <morf> you think police is accurate? :) 
[21:24:24] <morf> i dunno they were doing pretty good job afaict 
[21:24:27] <nativetexan> yeah, mostly...more accurate then the weather, more accurate than the news
[21:24:38] <morf> but ppl are getting crazy with the political correctness and gender / race bullshit 
[21:24:47] <nativetexan> yeah
