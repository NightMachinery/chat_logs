[03:38:42] <synaps3> is there proven backdoor in intel me ?
[03:38:48] <synaps3> has anyone caught it in action ?
[03:38:48] <operational> Gonna guess they have a mailing list bradyt
[03:38:54] <JibStyle> bradyt: Not sure, but i'm curious, what your question is? I am currently experiencing my own problem with gnutls.
[03:39:37] <bradyt> macos has two funny self-signed certs, and they show in all logging
[03:39:47] <bradyt> so for example, with `task sync`
[03:39:52] <bradyt> or `gnutls-cli google.com`
[03:40:24] <bradyt> i see an issue tracker at gitlab, but i don't see this situation described there
[03:40:41] <bradyt> other taskwarrior users are seeing it
[03:40:50] <bradyt> and there's a few other projects that report similar behavior
[03:43:00] <JibStyle> Oic. I'm not familiar with `task`. My issue is related to the DST Root CA X3 certificate that recently expired -- now TLS fails for many hosts. It breaks web browsing in my Cygwin Emacs.

[10:42:03] <Guest2022> diggity dawg
[10:42:06] <horseface> and it is that there is SO much conflicting information throughout the medical literature i mean to say what is present in the many various medical papers, the journal articles present in them, and actually i recently, just out of interest investigated the acute toxicity of methamphetamine, it actually turns out to be a fact that measured by ld50/kg for my body weight caffeine was about six grams more toxic than methamphetamine, now this is why
[10:42:06] <horseface> one may be capable of ingesting such humongous doses of meth and not display an toxicity in their physiology... now...  this isn't to say that one can inject a large dose and survive, i mean shit- when i administer a half gram (500mg) which is the most which you are able to fit into a one millilitre syringe, it fucking feels like i am brushing closely with death. but it is that you just do not fucking care because it feel sooo fucking good, aha...
[10:42:06] <horseface> it is, if you're not in great or even good physical health on a cardiovascular level, very possible to suffer a stroke or heart attack or something of the likes to this...
[10:42:24] <horseface> now i can only be assured of the certainty in the effects which i have noticed within myself ...
[10:42:28] <horseface> and before meth?

[10:44:28] <horseface> actually i graduated psychiatry and now ... as i said ... i am involved in quantum research. actually i live at the university... and the aspect which i am investigating is the relationship between time, gravity and velocity. actually issac newton has produced or discovered an equation which shows that there is a inverse relationship between a particles velocity or kinetic energy, as such... and its perceived influence of the property of time...
[10:44:28] <horseface> and i am researching this, actually...
[10:44:30] <Guest2022> CHILD RAPISTS feel EXACTLY THAT
[10:44:33] <horseface> and also not really, sir...
[10:44:42] <horseface> may i ask which search engine do you use?

[10:45:02] <Guest2022> That kind of thinking/justification/reasoning...
[10:45:09] <Guest2022> Is FUCKING SCARY as hell.
[10:45:13] <horseface> actually amphetamine is well known to cause an increase in the density of the DA (dopamine) receptor, mainly...

[10:56:10] <horseface> if you look at it, it is well established that inhibitory events or situations or circumstances, as such, well they will lead to apoptosis which is cell or nerve death in our neurology... now it is also well established that exercise is neurotrophic which means that it promotes neurogenesis. which means promotes cell or nerve growth in the brain... so ... think about this logically like a rational human being and disregard what you think you
[10:56:10] <horseface> already know. just bear in mind the extent to which misinformation plagues our society throughout all channels publicly available. okay. this comes down to private interest groups actually providing financial incentive to groups to say a particular thing to form social consensus or establish social agendas, now this is actually also present in law... actually ... it is that lawyer's education or the education provided to lawyers is in-fact untrue
[10:56:11] <horseface> to nature and fabricated to allow the establishment of conceptions or conventions, as such, throughout a society. this is one of them. that meth is bad. rofl. google search, for example, simply 'meth' look at it! ahah... the 'faces of meth' and etc. no. the government does NOT want a society capable of rebelling against them. they are doing whatever the fuck they can to actually impair us, by various means, one of them is the provision of various
[10:56:16] <horseface> pharmaceuticals... now one large contributor to this is the SSRI AD (antidepressant). actually the truth behind this is that serotonin (5-ht/5-hydroxytryptan) actually plays little or has little influence in determining or establishing our mood, or psychological disposition or state, as such... in-fact 5-ht is primarily involved in sensory perception. you will find many, many people complaining about the lack of efficacy of their SSRIs in treating
[10:56:21] <horseface> their depression. actually it is more or less just inhibitory in that it will eliminate your sex drive, or entirely reduce your libido to make you almost asexual... now anybody who has taken an SSRI will know that it is impairing, and inhibitory in its effects. they, especially a potent and selective one, the only selective one which exists which is citalopram, will produce feelings of lethargy and yes.

[20:59:09] <ajak> is it illegal to share the magnet?

[20:59:19] <Hash> Absolutely anything.

[20:59:41] <BadKarma> also is there a part 2 ?
[20:59:53] <SymbioticFemale> BadKarma: piratebay. i dont have more info.
[21:00:00] <mats1> he didnt miss anything, he wants attention and to be part of the discussion
[21:00:02] <MadCamel> if they wanted to prevent people from posting the magnet link they'd just add it to the censor list. One difference between old-freenode and libera is that there's a censor list. You have to set usermode +u if you wish to recieve uncensored PMs. Channel mode +u to allow uncensored public messages.
[21:00:06] <BadKarma> I have looked in piratebay it returned no results
[21:00:11] <BadKarma> that's why i was confused
[21:00:15] <deadk> ajak: i suspect it probably is, but who knows
[21:00:49] <MadCamel> for instance try pasting the eicar string in here. won't go through
[21:00:49] <ajak> actually, i would say it isn't, since it's public
[21:01:29] <ajak> for the same reason that TPB isn't liable for the content that notably isn't shared on their platform

[23:17:26] <Hash> otherwise, since every site is different, scraping for relevent information for a summary paragraph may not work well.
[23:17:41] <Hash> secbot title parse does descriptions and titles
[23:17:49] <Hash> Depending on what's available, intelligently.
[23:17:52] <jaggz> it also uses some other modules that try to get only the actual content (not buttons and ads and stuff)
[23:18:03] <Hash> It's trivial to write scrapers.
[23:18:05] <jaggz> yours is fine, btw, I'm just sharing
[23:18:23] <Hash> I would love to share things
[23:18:36] <Hash> Knowledge, how to do things, various stuff I don't know.
[23:18:38] <Hash> :)
[23:18:41] <jaggz> like, mozilla's reader view thing -- that project is available standalone, iirc (but I couldn't get it to work), ...
[23:18:51] <Hash> What is your language or preference?
[23:18:55] <jaggz> it's developed to get only the proper text content
[23:18:59] <Hash> I like PHP mostly above all, and then python
[23:19:12] <Hash> In fact, I even use php as a general purpose scripting language instead of pthon.
[23:19:19] <Hash> I cannot stand python indentation model
[23:19:23] <Hash> I love {}
[23:19:39] <Hash> PHP reminds me of C, it's very close to it, and one of the best web languages.
[23:19:50] <jaggz> hmm.  I like some qualities of some languages, and some of others -- and the opposite. :)
[23:19:58] <Hash> Yeah, like for example right
[23:20:03] <Hash> My main website, psychedelicsdaily.com
[23:20:18] <Hash> It's build using your normal static site html/css/js but also node/python/golang/php
[23:20:18] <jaggz> python's indentation is fast on my fingers, but screws me up because I like seeing more of my code on my screen at once
[23:20:35] <Hash> For this, I have special dedicated monitors to twist
[23:20:49] <Hash> If you go portrait/vertical mode, you get less wide and less space wasted on sides
[23:20:52] <jaggz> and then it makes me feel guilty for doing one liners, that it's allowed since version whatever, like if foo: bar
[23:20:53] <Hash> And you get longer reading content
[23:21:02] <Hash> For coding, I found vetical monitors are best.
[23:21:14] <jaggz> so, I like perl because it's fast and efficient
[23:21:15] <Hash> You can view at least 2 pages of code vertically
[23:21:22] <Hash> Perl is wonderful
[23:21:27] <jaggz> with lots of stuff built into its syntax (like regex)
[23:21:49] <Hash> Yes. Perl is a extraction and reporting language
[23:21:57] <Hash> So text processing/regex is part of it by design.
[23:22:08] <Hash> s/a/an/
[23:22:15] <jaggz> but python is a lot more advanced, and easier to handle data structures and stuff in it, without constant "oh wait, is that a reference?" (which is partially my own shortcoming)
[23:22:17] <jaggz> I don't do much php
[23:22:35] <Hash> I don't mind python, but I don't particularly have an affinity for it
[23:22:42] <Hash> I'm like an agnostic tech person
[23:22:56] <sartan> (oh wait, is that a reference? answer: yes.)
[23:22:58] <Hash> for example, what's the least amount of workI have to do go get something done
[23:23:02] <Hash> That's my goal right
[23:23:14] <jaggz> it seemed such a mess after it came out originally that, after evaluating it for projects, we decided not to use it.. so I used it only for some casual stuff here and there
[23:23:17] <Hash> So I go, ok, this module or this package or whatever exists in this ecosystem, cool.
[23:23:20] <sartan> options like shallow copy, pyrsistent, deepcopy, frozenset, frozendict are all loaded on top, everything is a reference out of the box.
[23:23:55] <jaggz> I did like that so many practical features for web services were available right there, without looking further
[23:24:13] <Hash> For example, for psychedelicsdaily.com https://www.psychedelicsdaily.com/drugs/ pages, I had to find chemistry software
[23:24:13] <secbot> ^ Psychedelic Drug Facts & Harm Reduction Information Database - Using Psychedelics Daily for a happy & healthy life
[23:24:22] <Hash> Well, the only chemistry software worthwhile were in python
[23:24:29] <Hash> So for this section of the site, purely python and db
[23:24:30] <sartan> are there any serious or large scale projects still in perl these days?
[23:24:58] <Hash> For https://www.psychedelicsdaily.com/community/ communities section, purely php, because the packages existed in the php packagist ecosystem
[23:24:59] <secbot> ^ Psychedelic Communities - Using Psychedelics Daily for a happy & healthy life
[23:25:06] <Hash> There are sections done purely on go lang
[23:25:09] <sartan> perl 'can be' used in amny places so i feel it gets misattributed as being deployed at scale.. but i really doubt this is the case anymore
[23:25:11] <Hash> some sections purely in bash
