[01:30:55] <FromGitter> <ivar> I'm struggling to find documentation on how I can configure the linter used by the javascript layer. https://www.spacemacs.org/layers/+lang/javascript/README.html doesn't help me find how I can turn off warnings based on coding style (i.e. I don't want to use a terminating semicolon, so my buffers are full of warnings :(  )
[01:38:42] <FromGitter> <ivar> on that note - how do people learn how to customize their spacemacs configs? I'm been plodding along with mostly defaults, or well documented tweaks but I'm not sure where to start looking when it comes to learning how to tweaking things that are off the current beaten path.

[02:08:30] <FromGitter> <eklitzke:matrix.org> look at the layer readme files first, if you want to do something more fancy look at the source code for the layer
[02:12:34] <FromGitter> <ivar> fair enough - I've scoured the readme, I'll start digging into how it works :P
[03:01:25] <FromGitter> <chadkennedyonline> If you run the "customize" command, you can see all variables intended to be tweaked, organized by functionality in a nice tree.  ‚èé  ‚èé Also, if you use the search box, and type in a layer name for a layer you have installed (for example "treemacs") you'll get a list of variables for that layer.
[03:04:04] <FromGitter> <milochadam> Yeah, I meant you can fallback to `(evil-add-command-properties #'evil-append-line :jump t)` if it works for you. Can you describe what you're going for again? I don't know if you want to toggle between some random point in the middle of the line and end of the line in insert mode or you mean something else?

[07:33:34] <FromGitter> <drewverlee> So it seems like magit rebase on spacemacs currently has some issues. But even beyond that, there is some quality of life problems with the way i do it. ‚èé  ‚èé 1) when your doing a rebase, nothing in the helpful suggestions tells you how to move forward with the process, even how to save your squash, fixups, etc.... ‚èé 2) assume you do what i do and :wq (which seems to work) you have to know to then 
[07:33:34] <FromGitter> ... magit-rebase-continue or fix conflicts.  ‚èé 3) if you fix conflicts you have to manually select the files with conflicts and then do magit-ediff-resolve.  ... [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=619c6815b5ba9e5a11ce861a]

[09:20:07] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> The only problem with `SPC h j eintr` is that `info` mode is not very user friendly... to fix it you can either use `evil-collection` bindings by doing `M-: (evil-collection-info-setup)` or you can use my priavte info layer which you can find here (https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/discussions/14757#discussioncomment-714850)

[13:39:32] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @yyoncho I would say there is a bug in lsp/spacemacs auto-completion configuration...
[13:40:53] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> For example when in a .c file I start with a preprocessor definition `#DEFINE STRINGSIZE 256` and I want to use it later in the buffer, then `STRINGSIZE` does not get auto-completed.
[13:41:08] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I have fixed this just recently for `emacs-lisp-mode`
[13:42:04] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> So the point is that `company-capf` hijacks all completions... therefore is should get grouped with e.g. `company-dabbrev-code`

[13:51:10] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Ah okay... did not expect that

[14:23:46] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I would say this should work by default... so maybe I should change it in Spacemacs configuration then
