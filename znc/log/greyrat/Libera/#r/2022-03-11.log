[17:14:59] <Adoi> hello, is there anyone who can use rstudio in conda?
[17:21:40] <Adoi> the correct question would be, "is there anyone here?" :)
[17:27:45] <since_> Yes
[17:28:10] <since_> What is conda?
[17:28:40] <since_> Is this this python stuff? Why should i use rstudio in python code?
[17:29:12] <since_> What do you want ro do?
[17:31:58] <Adoi> no it is not "python stuff" only. it has r packages, too, with which I created an env. but cant install rstudio there. since_ you just seem to have become familiar with it, I suppose you are not familiar with this kind of situation
[17:33:12] <since_> And what do you want to do?
[17:33:22] <Adoi> install rstudio
[17:33:46] <since_> The IDE aka the text editor?
[17:34:28] <Adoi> you can do a search and find everything about rstudio
[17:34:40] <Adoi> or conda
[17:42:01] <since_> yes but it makes no sense for me why you want to install an IDE from conda
[17:42:28] <since_> and the rstudio version in anaconda is 3 years old
[17:43:05] <since_> and not all CRAN packages are in conda, so it makes no sense to mix them both and use CRAN in the first place
[17:44:19] <since_> i recommend installing rstudio the "normal" way (R works without Rstudio aswell) and then you can use conda for your R packages?
[17:45:55] *** Joins: rickyrick (~rickyrick@d23-16-13-108.bchsia.telus.net)
[17:46:41] <since_> and if something is not in conda use install.packages("name") in the R shell
[17:47:00] <since_> select a local directory
[17:48:07] <since_> in ubuntu/debian many cran packages are also in your apt repository
[17:48:12] <Adoi> I generally do nothing outside of rstudio. I dont use system terminal for R, for ex. interesting that the version is that old. earlier conda's version was the better match for my needs.  
[17:48:44] <Adoi> due to some package unavailability, version mismatch etc..
[17:49:25] <Adoi> perhaps I can use conda just for packages I dont find otherwise
[17:49:37] <since_> the R shell is also available in Rstudio, Rstudio can manage your packages aswell
[17:49:45] <Adoi> yes
[17:50:09] <since_> https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download
[17:51:08] <Adoi> I have rstudio already
[17:51:56] <since_> then everything is fine :)
[17:52:30] <Adoi> as I said, I thought rstudio in conda would be preferable, but didnt notice/expect that it was old. that is not the case with others.
[17:54:54] <since_> but why should i install an ide over this library manager? i dont install firefox from it and i would not want it to install me a microsoft word if the developer of a library likes to use word for editing their documentation
[17:57:01] <Adoi> as I explained, conda used to have (maybe still has) versions of R packages that were newer or did not exist in other places. and when you have those packages there, you can use them in rstudio, too. that is the reason. also rstudio itself was newer then.
[18:00:06] <Adoi> if, for example, you dont have new packages in your OS' connected R repository, you cant use them in rstudio, either. therefore it makes sense to use rstudio where you can, too, find packages you need.

[21:19:23] <rickyrick> Such is life in the zone
[21:20:49] <Bayes> dude I was trying to come up with some intuition for this yesterday but it's too much for my brain
[21:21:32] <Bayes> rho = cor(x, y) for x, y scalars ‚Üí rho is a scalar
[21:21:55] <Bayes> rho = cor(x, y) for x, y vectors of size n, m ‚Üí rho is a n√óm matrix
[21:22:56] <Bayes> rho = cor(x, y, z) for x, y, z vectors of size n, m, p -> rho is a ??? (‚äôÔºø‚äô')
[21:24:28] <Bayes> idk, I was trying to go pairwise and see if I could come up with some kind of structure for cor(x, y, z) but it was kinda weird
[21:25:27] <rickyrick> uh
[21:25:37] <rickyrick> It doesn't even make sense to take cor(x,y,z) for scalar values
[21:26:18] <Bayes> yeah my notation was lazy for cor(x, y) cor (x, z) cor (y, z)
[21:26:34] <rickyrick> lmao
[21:26:41] <Bayes> I mean if you have three variables, that's what you do
[21:26:52] <Bayes> hence what I mentioned going pairwise
[21:27:14] <rickyrick> Yeah so maybe just concatenate the three vectors cor(c(x,y,z), c(x,y,z))
[21:27:19] <rickyrick> Then inspect the corresponding blocks of the matrix
[21:29:33] <Bayes> hm I'm not sure if that's what you mean, but I did was basically cor(x, y) for each z, and then average over the z
[21:30:00] <Bayes> and also, drop z and just do cor(x, y) for "marginal" correlation of x, y?
[21:31:22] <Bayes> but really it's a kind of weird structure
[21:32:01] <rickyrick> You'd have a square block matrix of size n + m + p
[21:32:21] <rickyrick> Where the n by n block is cor(x,x), n by m is cor(x,y), n by p is cor(x,z), etc.
[21:32:21] <Bayes> gotcha
