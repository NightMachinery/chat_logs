[20:32:43] <curdlesnoot> I wish somebody would mention it. I would if I could.
[20:33:23] <earnestly> Hm
[20:33:32] <curdlesnoot> it's been driving me mad watching the conversation. lol.
[20:33:37] <earnestly> # touch Ω; LC_ALL=C ls # but
[20:33:39] <shbot> earnestly: Ω
[20:33:49] <earnestly> I suppose I understand this
[20:33:51] <curdlesnoot> you need that all-important GNU quoting style.
[20:33:54] <curdlesnoot> it's really useful.
[20:34:11] *** Joins: jmcantrell (~weechat@user/jmcantrell)
[20:34:16] <curdlesnoot> it no longer lies, and the octal sequences are both understandable and re-usable from bash.
[20:34:43] <curdlesnoot> by lies, I mean that squashing to ? nonsense where stdout is a tty.
[20:34:54] <earnestly> Yeah, octal is also useful in sh
[20:35:12] <curdlesnoot> thanks to printf, right.
[20:35:42] <earnestly> Well insofar as posix in general only really understands octal notation
[20:35:56] <curdlesnoot> I had this ridiculous feud with in another channel the other day. I was trying to explain that, no, they really aren't "question marks". yes, the output of ls with the appropriate quoting style in efffect does prove this.
[20:35:57] <earnestly> But yes, printf too
[20:35:59] <curdlesnoot> with someone*
[20:36:02] <curdlesnoot> they just didn't get it.
[20:36:14] <curdlesnoot> supposedly, "escaping the question marks" was the solution.
[20:37:06] <earnestly> To be fair they are literal question marks in the output.  Also happens with not having read permissions while having execute on a directory iirc (or vice versa)
[20:37:17] <earnestly> But it's lossy output
[20:37:57] <curdlesnoot> the confusion was understandable. it was the incapbility to rectify the ensuing, faulty reasoning, in the face of incontrovertible evidence that took the wind right out of my sail.
[20:39:00] <curdlesnoot> anyway, that's an exceptionally useful GNU feature.
[20:44:00] <curdlesnoot> oh dear, it's getting worse. ls and grep now, is it.
[20:44:45] <earnestly> Things will get much better when you realise that you can't expect the sheep to behave like the farmer
