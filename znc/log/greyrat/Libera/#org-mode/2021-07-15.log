[21:06:22] <fsbot> ERROR: [set term] org-ql is already something else.. Use ’is also’.. 
[21:06:23] <fsbot>  Currently: redirect org-agenda-ng
[21:06:38] <corwin> fsbot: forget org-ql
[21:06:41] <fsbot> Forgot "org-ql" which had one note:  ["redirect org-agenda-ng"]
[21:06:44] <corwin> fsbot: org-ql is a query language for org-files, on MELPA and https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql
[21:06:46] <fsbot> Created new note for "org-ql"
[21:08:00] <corwin> fsbot: org-ql is also or ask me about `org-agenda-ng' which is also called org-ql
[21:08:03] <fsbot> Added note [1] for term "org-ql"

[21:21:57] <rdrg109> corwin: Thanks for the information. While I value the existing of packages, I'd rather first find out whether it is possible to accomplish this natively and if that involves a lot of effort, then I would go search a package.
[21:22:16] <rdrg109> I was able to do what I was searching with the following search (org-tags-view nil "CREATED>=\"<2021-08-01>\"+CREATED<=\"<2021-08-31>\"")
[21:22:54] <rdrg109> For those who don't know, org-tags-view is a built-in function.
[21:23:26] <rdrg109> It is amazing that Org Mode supports numerical comparison and numerical coimparison supports date comparison. Org Mode is definetively a gem.
[21:23:56] <grym> if i can get anyone else to do my time math for me, i'm happier
[21:26:05] <rdrg109> corwin: Thanks for sharing the org-ql package. I had never used that package. I looked into it and I think it will help me when I need to perform more advanced searches since the syntax is more friendly because of its similarity with lisp.
[21:27:30] <corwin> coolio :D   I'm with you on trying core approaches first.   At least, when I'm trying to get something done.  When I'm trying to understand how to "think like emacs", I often roll my own thing and then compare that to packages and core-only approaches.

[22:17:36] <rdrg109> [Q] How to get the language of an Org Mode document? I'm referring to the language that is specified through the #+LANGUAGE: affiliated keyword and is usually placed at the beginning of a document.
[22:18:00] <rdrg109> I would like to get the language programmatically

[22:27:33] <corwin> rdrg109: I don't recognize #+LANGUAGE - I think we can usually get the language per block by taking `car' of the info list returned from `org-babel-get-src-block-info'
[22:28:26] <corwin> That may have been badly said.  Sorry, if it was confusing.
[22:28:51] <corwin> I mean, afaik, org docs don't have a language at the document level.  Only at the block level.

[22:29:15] <grym> corwin: maybe rdrg109 means natural language?
[22:29:27] <grym> that's how i read it first, which i am now wondering why
[22:30:22] <corwin> honestly programming would be much easier for us all if we didn't have all of this tedious "trying to get other humans to understand us" to deal with all the time.
