[00:08:58] <lz_> do you mean 11:59:59:99999999 ?
[00:10:01] <blezz> "A new COVID-19 vaccine has achieved 100 percent efficacy against severe disease and hospitalizations, announced manufacturers Sanofi and GSK."
[00:10:16] <blezz> I talked with someone about Sanofi here
[00:11:36] <lz_> i know someone who works at sanofi from my sports class
[00:12:07] <lz_> haven't seen him back yet since december though
[00:14:01] <blezz> tl;dr good time to invest in sanofi

[00:48:28] <jonp> no
[00:48:38] <Lukky> :-(
[00:48:49] <Nasp> MatthiasVance: What is that
[00:49:11] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Citizen number
[00:49:13] <jonp> Lukky: can you imagine how much maintaining that collection would slow things down?
[00:49:32] <jonp> also, structs
[00:49:34] <Nasp> MatthiasVance: Ahh you mean social security number
[00:49:56] <Nasp> Does anyone use strongly typed id?
[00:50:07] <Nasp> So you have stuff like "new UserId(1)" ?
[00:50:41] <DevJohnC> yes
[00:50:45] <DevJohnC> I recommend it
[00:50:52] <Nasp> Are these structs or classes?
[00:50:57] <DevJohnC> structs
[00:51:08] <Nasp> Ours is classes, and i have a feeling that isn't great for GC
[00:51:22] <Nasp> Not sure if it matters that much but i have a feeling it could have a bit of overhead
[00:51:23] <DevJohnC> depends on your backing type but probably not
[00:51:33] <Nasp> Most are Ints and Guids
[00:51:55] <Nasp> I kinda want to write one that's struct based, and then be able to serialize it back and forth to json
[00:51:56] <DevJohnC> if for nothing else a struct would be better for having value type semantics
[00:52:02] <Nasp> And also use it in Asp
[00:52:19] <Nasp> Or with .NET 6 atleast a record
[00:52:21] <Lukky> jonp: here's the thing. I'm writing add-ins for a software. An add-in is defined by a class implementing a specific interface. When loaded, the add-ins are instantiated, and one of them has an extra interface that allows me to override a method called when it's loaded. I do not have direct references to the other objects at that point. I do know they are instantiated though. Any way to get a
[00:52:21] <Lukky> reference to those?
[00:52:33] <Nasp> DevJohnC:  Do you transfer yours to database or to an API?
[00:52:42] <DevJohnC> Nasp, there's a nuget package with a code generator that can do the work for you
[00:52:50] <jonp> Lukky: only if they're exposed by "something else"
[00:52:55] <Nasp> DevJohnC:  Yeah i've seen that one
[00:53:07] <Nasp> I had the same idea for a while, and was considering something like that
[00:53:20] <Nasp> But not sure i like the way it may generate dependencies
[00:53:26] <DevJohnC> I only use them in my business layer currently
[00:53:30] <Lukky> damn... thanks though... I'll have to figure out something...
[00:53:34] <DevJohnC> I'm considering extending that to my storage layer
[00:53:40] <Nasp> Ours are transferede over message bus and as json
[00:53:40] <DevJohnC> (ie, EntityFramework)
[00:53:42] <Nasp> And to EF
[00:53:48] <Nasp> And they aren't converted properly
[00:53:54] <Nasp> Just parsed everywhere and it annoys me
[00:54:12] <DevJohnC> the library I use lets you specify what type conversions it should have
[00:54:23] <DevJohnC> if you set it to none you don't get any extra dependencies in your code
[00:54:31] <Nasp> I was thinking of using some IValueType interface or Attribute decorator
[00:54:36] <Nasp> To mark the classes and structs
[00:54:43] <DevJohnC> I use the System.Text.Json support it has and will be trying out the EF type support is has
[00:54:45] <Nasp> And then they should all the the same methods for value conversions
[00:54:57] <DevJohnC> Nasp, that's kinda ugly
[00:55:01] <Nasp> DevJohnC: But with none you don't get any value conversions
[00:55:08] <DevJohnC> right
[00:55:11] <Nasp> DevJohnC:  Is it ugle to have conversion methods?
[00:55:31] <DevJohnC> Nasp, why would you need them?
[00:55:49] <Nasp> To convert from int to the value type and back?
[00:56:13] <DevJohnC> Nasp, that breaks the purpose of having a strongly typed id?
[00:56:22] <Nasp> But you need a way to start the value type
[00:56:31] <DevJohnC> but the package exposes a ctor to create instances
[00:56:34] <Nasp> How do you new it up without any methotds to create one
[00:56:37] <DevJohnC> and .Value exposes the underlying value
[00:56:44] <Nasp> That's a conversion method right?
[00:56:55] <Nasp> I would jsut prefer if they all had a .Value and a .Parse method
[00:56:55] <DevJohnC> if you wanna view it that way
[00:56:58] <Nasp> As a requirement
[00:57:15] <Nasp> If all value types have that, that would make it easier to json serialize and save them in EF
[00:57:33] <Nasp> I also think that's how the lib you describe does it
[00:59:28] <Nasp> DevJohnC:  Since we transfer ours between systems and in EF, i don't like manually mapping those
[01:00:04] <DevJohnC> right, which is why I like having the json and ef support as part of the implementation of the generated type
[01:00:33] <Nasp> Yeah except that doesn't work great if you share the type across projects
[01:01:18] <DevJohnC> why?
[01:01:51] <Nasp> Because if imagine i need this value type in Newtonsoft, System.Text ,EF, Mongo
[01:02:01] <Nasp> Then i force all other projects to get a dpeendency on newtonsoft and EF and so on
[01:02:04] <Nasp> That's not nice
[01:02:13] <Nasp> You'd end up with dependency hell
[01:02:16] <DevJohnC> oh, I've just written the type out in each distinct use case, it's 2 lines of code and it's easy to keep track of
[01:02:42] <Nasp> So you have the same value types in many places or?
[01:02:43] <MatthiasVance> Lukky: Do you have docs on the addin architecture?
[01:03:00] <MatthiasVance> Lukky: If you can get a reference to whatever is instantiating YOUR addin it might have a list of all of them?
[01:03:00] <DevJohnC> in practice I have some of the same value types in 2 places max
[01:06:30] <lz_> "I have students who can walk and talk and read and write who were born in 2016. Wtf?"
[01:12:41] <jonp> that's not "insane" for a 6 year old to do all that…
[01:12:51] <jonp> rare, though, and i wonder *what* they're reading while walking…
[01:13:53] <lz_> i think the emphasis is on "2016" and not "6 yo" :D
[01:14:00] <lz_> time fucking flies
[01:14:01] <jonp> 2022-2016 == 6
[01:15:34] <jonp> guess the implicit point is "wait, 2016 was *that long ago*?!"
[01:16:10] <Nasp> DevJohnC:  I would just ifnd it a bit annoying to have the same value types 10-20 different places
[01:16:21] <Nasp> If not more
[01:16:43] <DevJohnC> if you need it 10-20 different places with different support you did something very wrong
[01:17:43] <Nasp> If i have a value type there's a chance i need it 10 different place sright
[01:17:47] <Nasp> And not right besides where i created it
[01:18:16] <DevJohnC> yeah, but you only need to declare it once per permutation of encoding/decoding support you need
[01:18:36] <DevJohnC> which is, maximum, like 3 or 4 if you're doing weird mixes of json encoders
[01:20:58] <Nasp> Maybe i misunderstood you, but you said you just duiplicated it?
[01:21:04] <Nasp> If needed in multiple places
[01:21:46] <DevJohnC> I have it declared once for all scenarios that just need System.Text.Json support and I might declare it again for projects that need the EF support
[01:22:06] <DevJohnC> but, yeah, it's not ideal and I might investigate ways around it
[01:24:34] <Nasp> Like if i need it in 20 different projects, that isn't unsuualy
[01:24:42] <Nasp> Then i dont want to declare the same valeu type again
[01:24:47] <Nasp> Just because it's a different assembly
[01:24:57] <Nasp> But that might be the part i misudnerstood
[01:25:05] <DevJohnC> right, you'd write the one permutation you need and reference it
[01:27:21] <Nasp> yes but taht doesn't work  well with the dependencies if you ust that lib for generation
[01:27:55] <DevJohnC> riiiight, so write 1 for each permutation you need and reference those... or include the source file with ifdefs or something
[01:28:14] <DevJohnC> generally I don't have this problem, though, at least not yet
[01:28:19] <Nasp> Yeah i want to split it so the converters doesn't leak
[01:28:25] <Nasp> Yeah this is a bit bigger system
[01:32:26] <Nasp> I wanted to make so the value types are dumb and doesn't know about Json or EF or anything
[01:32:36] <Nasp> But have the DB or Web layer know about the Value type interface

[01:45:39] <sysRPL> does anyone here play with or use dotnet core on a raspberry pi sbc?
[01:46:35] <sysRPL> i was / am trying to figure out if a linux desktop pc with vs code can remote debug on a pi without the pi running a desktop
[01:46:37] *** Quits: gandhibobandhi (~gandhibob@2a02:8109:86c0:4a40:24d9:e45a:b22f:345a) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[01:47:41] <sysRPL> in the past i've been using rsync from my linux desktop roject to my pi, then running my programs withotu debugging on the pi using a terminal and ssh
[01:48:32] <sysRPL> it would be so much nicer of an experience if i could just remote debug from my linux desktop to a headless pi
[01:49:36] <sysRPL> i am working on pi specific stuff with dotnet such as gpio / spi / ic2 / digital circuits
[01:49:42] <Nasp> Nice
[01:49:47] <Nasp> I have a few projects like that planned
[01:49:59] <Nasp> One of my collegues talked about something where he could mount the GPIO remotely
[01:50:02] <sysRPL> Nasp: i've been doing this for a while, but using ssh
[01:50:14] <Nasp> So he ran the problem locally but got the GPIO from the pi somehow
[01:50:36] <sysRPL> i was forced in the past to use mono develop
[01:50:52] <sysRPL> because the pi zero didn't supprot dotnet core
[01:51:20] <sysRPL> but now that the pi zero w 2 has been released, i am going to move back to dotnet core
[01:51:38] <sysRPL> it has an arm v8 cpu
[01:52:34] <sysRPL> i think vs code remote debugging requires a remote instance of vs code running on your debug target to operate
[01:53:08] <irwiss> normal vs can do remote debugging
[01:53:14] <sysRPL> which is a no go for me
[01:53:25] <irwiss> 🤷‍♂️
[01:53:25] <sysRPL> irwiss: i run linux
[01:54:20] <sysRPL> previously i had an command in monodevelop to build, rsync, and run in one step
[01:54:43] <sysRPL> using a tmux session on the pi
[01:54:46] <lz_> today I learned ilse koch "the witch of buchenwald" lived longer than my mom
[01:54:53] <Nasp> sysRPL:  It requires some files mounted
[01:55:02] <Nasp> I made it work a long time ago in vscode before vscode had support for C#
[01:55:05] <Nasp> So it's doable
[01:55:09] <sysRPL> hrmmm
[01:55:44] <sysRPL> this week i had a problem on a students linux laptop setting up vs code omnisharp .... i was getting a bunch of errors
[01:56:54] <sysRPL> but this year i think i should make some machines with a pi zero w 2, dotnet core, a 3d printer, some motors, and some custom circuits

[01:58:25] <Nasp> Can you make those yourselves where you live
[01:58:35] <sysRPL> why not?
[01:58:50] <Nasp> Due to laws and regulations regarding vechicles
[01:59:00] <Nasp> I considered an ebike but i have nowhere to park it
[01:59:06] <sysRPL> in the usa they want people to build their own vehicles
[01:59:21] <sysRPL> it's part of the fabric of society here
[01:59:22] <Nasp> I bought one of those scootey scoot, but they are kinda boring since the are restricted to less than bike speed
[01:59:52] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Usually when you build a vehicle you have to get it certified and then it's fine
[01:59:59] <Nasp> Yeah
[02:00:05] <Nasp> But that's usually not an easy process
[02:00:23] <sysRPL> they had limits on speed of ebikes 2 years ago in NYC and abandoned the effort
[02:00:51] <sysRPL> they abandoned ebike speed limits real quick once covid restrictions started popping up
[02:00:52] <Nasp> Here's it limited to 20/kmh
[02:00:58] <Nasp> But electric bikes can drive 40 km/h
[02:01:11] <Nasp> No idea what to do with the scooter now
[02:01:13] <Nasp> So slow
[02:01:17] <sysRPL> as ebikes where the #1 way people were getting ood / supplies in NYC at the time

[02:06:28] <sysRPL> here is an interesting face
[02:06:30] <sysRPL> fact
[02:06:49] <sysRPL> lately a lot of people have been dying due to train crashes here
[02:07:07] <sysRPL> we've had more fatal train crashes than anywhere in the world at any time
[02:07:28] <sysRPL> 4 fatal crashes in a 200 mile stretch each week
[02:08:30] <sysRPL> https://www.google.com/search?q=brightline+train+crash
[02:09:07] <MatthiasVance> If you do have to do stuff in the JS ecosystem.. https://parceljs.org/ seems pretty nice
[02:10:00] <sysRPL> the reason why there are some many train crashes each week is -> people aren't used to frequently running high speed trains and are ignoring railroad crossing barriers
[02:10:00] <bpmedley> MatthiasVance : Are you evaluating different tech stacks for your future web projects?
[02:10:18] <MatthiasVance> bpmedley: No just came across it
[02:10:48] <bpmedley> MatthiasVance : So the previous tech stack discussion and this are not related?
[02:11:19] <MatthiasVance> bpmedley: Only by sharing the same space (web) :D
[02:11:48] <bpmedley> I can't tell what Parcel is fixing from the frontend perspective.
[02:12:12] <Nasp> sysRPL:  I remember him complaining a lot
[02:12:28] <Nasp> But no idea the entire story behind his multiple show moves
[02:13:14] <MatthiasVance> sysRPL: What is high speed?
[02:13:20] <MatthiasVance> 300km/h?
[02:13:22] <sysRPL> 140 mph
[02:13:47] <Nasp> isn't that slow speed
[02:13:53] <Nasp> Also dont your crossings have barries?
[02:13:57] <sysRPL> that's fast for the usa
[02:14:02] <Nasp> We have a few left without barries and they claim a few lives each year
[02:14:04] <sysRPL> yes they do
[02:14:09] <Nasp> And it's deemed acceptable by gov
[02:14:12] <bpmedley> 75 mph is just so fast
[02:14:15] <sysRPL> but people drive around them stupidly. this is florida
[02:15:04] <MatthiasVance> The max they do here is 160 for intercity trains, and 300 km/h for international ones
[02:15:06] <Nasp> I would also say 300km/h is high speed
[02:15:19] <Nasp> Gov deemed that the country is too small for high speed trains
[02:15:26] <sysRPL> this is high speed for the usa
[02:15:30] <Nasp> But envourage everyone to use more public transport by increasing prices
[02:15:49] <MatthiasVance> I think regular (intercity) train here does 100-120 km/h
[02:15:51] <MatthiasVance> Not 160
[02:16:11] <sysRPL> 225kph = 140mph
[02:17:16] <sysRPL> if you like videos about trains and railroad line construction check out this guy documenting this rail line i have been mentioning -> https://www.youtube.com/c/TheRoamingRailfan
[02:17:17] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  You hav einternational trains?
[02:17:37] <sysRPL> he has some great drone footage, especially of rail construction
[02:18:28] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Yes
[02:19:11] <Nasp> MatthiasVance:  What is that parcel
[02:19:30] <Nasp> Ahh a new webpack
[02:19:51] <MatthiasVance> Saw "zero configuration" to get started .. was like .. yeah that's not something I see every day :P
[02:20:51] <Nasp> webpack is a beast
[02:20:57] <Nasp> I've never liked is non typesafe stuff
[02:21:05] <Nasp> I liked the way gulp was set up
[02:21:42] <Nasp> I dont get how angular can take 1 minute to compile a basic application
[02:22:22] <Nasp> .parcels config file :(
[02:22:26] <Nasp> Why not a ts config file
[02:22:58] <bpmedley> I wonder what will become of the current browser frontend ecosystem in one - two years..
[02:24:10] <Nasp> It will be even more of a mess :D
[02:24:41] <MatthiasVance> That's why I really hope WebAssembly takes off :D
[02:24:42] <bpmedley> One parcels config file with a bunch of .ts configuration of webpack
[02:25:15] <bpmedley> Will the various WebAssembly libraries and frameworks interop?  Can I use Rust WebAssembly with C# Blazor?
[02:28:23] <MatthiasVance> "Blazor WebAssembly apps can use native dependencies built to run on WebAssembly. You can statically link native dependencies into the .NET WebAssembly runtime using the .NET WebAssembly build tools, the same tools used to ahead-of-time (AOT) compile a Blazor app to WebAssembly and to relink the runtime to remove unused features."
[02:29:02] <MatthiasVance> But, I think not?
[02:29:05] <bpmedley> The way I interpret that is a yes, Rust and Blazor WebAssembly can interop.  Is that correct?
[02:29:19] <DevJohnC> you could pinvoke
[02:29:39] <bpmedley> I wonder what pinvoke would be in the browser..
[02:29:43] <MatthiasVance> The page says you can reference wasm: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/webassembly-native-dependencies?view=aspnetcore-6.0
[02:30:17] <bpmedley> That does look like .wasm files can interop with Blazor.
[02:30:31] <bpmedley> Thanks!  I did not know that
[02:31:06] <MatthiasVance> Shitty thing is the hot reload thing is based on EnC (iirc) but F# doesn't have that :D

[02:39:41] <MatthiasVance> ki9a: You were talking about the .NET Debugger API a while back, what were you doing with it?
[02:39:50] <Nasp> i stumbled upon the first blazor site in the wild
[02:39:55] <Nasp> But i didn't see .dll files in the transfer
[02:40:00] <Nasp> Also it was slow
[02:40:24] <bpmedley> Nasp : Is it a public url?  Would you give the url?
[02:41:00] *** Joins: alguien (~alguien@user/alguien)
[02:41:14] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: It also depends on the hosting model they use
[02:41:25] <Nasp> yeah i think they use  the  wrong one
[02:41:33] <MatthiasVance> If they make a roundtrip to the server for every .. thing .. you .. do .. then yes it can be terribly slow
[02:43:11] <Nasp> Yeah i couldn't figure out what model they used
[02:43:20] <Nasp> bpmedley:  this one https://nytsite.hardwareonline.dk/
[02:43:31] <bpmedley> Nasp : Doesn't server model use a websocket connection?
[02:43:41] <Nasp> i dont think so
[02:44:00] <Nasp> Only 105 requests on load :D
[02:44:09] <Nasp> all scripts are from cdn, it looks insane
[02:44:33] <Nasp> 12 requests to cookielaw.org
[02:44:36] <Nasp> :D
[02:44:48] <bpmedley> Nasp  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/host-and-deploy/server?view=aspnetcore-6.0#signalr-configuration
[02:44:49] <Nasp> Why can't 3rd party shitty script providers make it single file
[02:44:56] <Nasp> bpmedley:  Yeah but that's signalr
[02:45:10] <bpmedley> Did you read the paragraph that quickly?
[02:45:15] <Nasp> yes
[02:45:27] <bpmedley> lazor works best when using WebSockets as the SignalR transport due to lower latency ??????
[02:45:40] <Nasp> Doesn't that also depends on what transport you use
[02:45:44] <Nasp> HTTP1 vs 2
[02:45:47] <Diablo-D3> Nasp: usually your own build system cats and minifies your entire js bundle
[02:45:50] <Nasp> But ofc an open connection is faster but you can also get blocking
[02:45:56] <bpmedley> Nasp : I don't know.
[02:46:00] <Nasp> Diablo-D3: Yeah but most seem to not do that
[02:46:15] <Diablo-D3> you mean like other people's trash websites?
[02:46:18] <Diablo-D3> depends on what they're doing
[02:46:32] <bpmedley> Nasp : So, was there a websocket or long polling connection?
[02:46:44] <Nasp> bpmedley:  You tell me :D
[02:46:46] <Nasp> But i dont think so
[02:46:50] <Nasp> It looks like normal get request
[02:46:52] <Diablo-D3> google does insane tricks internally, a mix of stuff in the <head>, small "must run now" in a preloaded js, and then a monolithic minified js for the boring shit
[02:46:55] <Nasp> But it has a bunch of garbage in it
[02:46:57] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: What makes you think that website uses webassembly?
[02:47:01] <Diablo-D3> just to shave a couple ms off
[02:47:01] <Nasp> It looks kinda like the old webforms viewstate
[02:47:14] <Nasp> MatthiasVance: Well i'm not totally sure but i saw a request that says blazor
[02:47:21] <Nasp> It could also just be that the dev who made it included it by a mistake
[02:47:36] <MatthiasVance> The exact URL you sent doesn't use webassembly
[02:47:47] <Nasp> ""_framework/blazor.server.js""
[02:47:51] <Nasp> Well then i tihnk they have included it by a mistake
[02:47:57] <Nasp> It has a bunch of blazor resources loaded in
[02:48:08] <MatthiasVance> ah wait
[02:48:11] <MatthiasVance> wait wait wait
[02:48:20] <MatthiasVance> This is server-side blazor
[02:48:27] <Nasp> Also last time this site tried to rewrite the site was 5-8 years ago
[02:48:28] <MatthiasVance> That's why it's not webassembly
[02:48:33] <Nasp> And they ended up poirting all data to an untested site
[02:48:35] <Nasp> That was full of holes
[02:48:46] <Nasp> Within 30 minutes of the beta site being published someone had dumped the database
[02:48:54] <Nasp> MatthiasVance: Yeah i said blazor
[02:48:57] <bpmedley> Nasp : https://nytsite.hardwareonline.dk/_framework/blazor.server.js
[02:49:01] <Nasp> But yes it looks like they serversite renders it all
[02:49:09] <Nasp> I would assume that's why it's so slow
[02:49:10] <bpmedley> It's Blazor Server

[02:49:49] <Nasp> I just took a danish tabloid site, 350 requests :D
[02:50:08] <Nasp> Probably 50% tracking and plugins
[02:50:28] <bpmedley> I wonder if the tracking and plugins is why they need jQuery
[02:50:34] <Nasp> Probably
[02:50:40] <Nasp> We also still have jquery 1.2 :D
[02:50:45] <bpmedley> Omg
[02:50:49] <Nasp> I wonder how many bugs there is in that
[02:50:55] <bpmedley> jQuery begot jQuery
[02:51:01] <MatthiasVance> I find that site pretty fast tbh
[02:51:20] <MatthiasVance> Then again it's nighttime
[02:51:41] <Nasp> I find it slow
[02:51:44] <Nasp> Some seem to be the request
[02:51:49] <Nasp> And some weird rendering maybe
[02:51:55] <bpmedley> How many hops away are the IPs?
[02:52:05] <Nasp> Ohh yeah i read that SignalR for .NEt 7 will get generators
[02:52:22] <MatthiasVance> Anyway time for zzz see you later :D
[02:52:25] <Nasp> ahh yeah MatthiasVance  is in NL where all danish sites are hosted

[04:25:41] <Suchiman> sysRPL: VS (Code) do support headless remote debugging over SSH
[04:26:28] <Suchiman> jonp: 22:19:14 <•jonp> Lukky: can you imagine how much maintaining that collection would slow things down? <--- for a matter of fact, i can imagine, about 100x :> because the runtime does it (for finalizeable objects)
[04:27:22] <Nasp>  Suchiman  What's your opinion about custom value types not being a struct?
[04:27:30] <Suchiman> Nasp: omfg
[04:27:30] <Nasp> Like "new UserId(1)"
[04:27:42] <Suchiman> Nasp: incredibly inefficient xD
[04:28:26] <Suchiman> assuming that's an int as backing storage and runs on x64, that takes 24 bytes for the object (instead of 4) + another 8 bytes for the reference that would otherwise just store 4 bytes inline xD
[04:29:00] <Suchiman> if you make that a struct, then that struct is 4 bytes just like the int and the JIT has special optimizations for single field structs like that (basically treating them like the underlying field)
[04:29:08] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Ints and guids
[04:29:36] <Nasp> But it's just hard to figure out how much this actually hurts unless i make a small benchmark
[04:29:38] <Suchiman> yeah Guid is 16 bytes so it's less extreme, 32 bytes object + 8 byte reference
[04:29:43] <Nasp> Which probably won't show a good result
[04:30:28] <Nasp> It's not that many value types but i just wonder if the impact could be measured
[04:35:00] <Suchiman> Nasp: yeah well it's also hard to measure since it's impact is in induced GC pauses (allocating objects is like a call with two checks and a pointer bump in assembly, doesn't get much cheaper as far as allocating things goes, but ofc not allocating anything on the heap is much cheaper :P
[04:40:39] <Nasp> I did some benchmark on regex vs just parsing using span and it's quite surprising
[04:42:06] <Suchiman> Nasp: hm?
[04:42:50] <Nasp> Well regarding allocations i did a benchmark where i replaced a regex with spans of strings
[04:42:54] <Nasp> And parsed it that way instead
[04:42:55] <Suchiman> regex should be able to get close, after all, they've been putting lots of work into regex in core and making use of Span internally :P
[04:43:21] <Nasp> Still pretty sure int.parse twice is faster :D
[04:43:28] <Nasp> Which really was just what the regex was doing
[04:43:46] <Suchiman> Nasp: well, eventually you have to pass either a string from regex or the Span into int and then obviously span wins :P
[04:44:33] <Suchiman> what part suprises you here :P ?
[04:44:58] <Nasp> Well not really anything regex will always be slower
[04:45:03] <Nasp> But i just like doing benchmarkdotnet stuff
[04:45:43] <Suchiman> ah xD
[04:45:49] <Suchiman> benchmarking is fun :>
[04:46:13] <Nasp> I replaced our service locator with a real container and it was 800 times faster :D
[04:46:21] <Suchiman> 02:10:39 <Nasp> I did some benchmark on regex vs just parsing using span and it's quite surprising <--- but you promised me a suprise :<
[04:46:29] <Suchiman> Nasp: haha
[04:46:38] <Suchiman> Autofac?
[04:47:03] <Nasp> And the "service locator" is really just a bunch of methods with "return new Dep1(new Dep2(new Dep2))"
[04:47:08] <Nasp> Nested quite deeply
[04:47:23] <Nasp> And also with probably 10 or so invoations of DbConnection and DbContext and so on
[04:47:31] <Nasp> So it avoids instanciating tose
[04:47:33] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Yes Autofac
[04:47:37] <Suchiman> >_<
[04:47:42] <Suchiman> ouchy
[04:47:48] <Nasp> Hmm i wonder if i should create the same test for MS DI
[04:47:57] <Nasp> Just to compare
[04:48:15] <Nasp> Also when using Autofac with MS Di i can't quite figure out where i'm resolving from
[04:48:24] <Nasp> Is Autofac just regsistering it all in MS DI
[04:48:33] <Nasp> Or is it replacing MS DI or maybe they live a bit together
[04:51:17] <Suchiman> Nasp: when you plug Autofac into Microsoft Extensions DI then that replaces the entire backend, basically only serving as a kind of interface
[04:52:47] <Nasp> Hmm ok
[04:53:09] <Nasp> I can't figure out if i should start phasing out Autofac
[04:54:28] <Nasp> https://github.com/danielpalme/IocPerformance
[05:06:26] <Suchiman> Nasp: why would you want to? as long as you're not using MEF ;>
[05:08:36] <Nasp> We actually have something that uses MEF
[05:08:38] <Nasp> :D
[05:08:44] <Nasp> And it breaks just if you sneeze near it
[05:08:55] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Well i was just thinking Autofac might go out of fashion
[05:08:58] <Suchiman> oh god
[05:09:02] <Nasp> But i kinda prefer Autofac's style
[05:09:08] <Nasp> It's in a separete project luckily
[05:09:12] <Nasp> thinktectures identity server
[05:09:25] <Suchiman> i dunno, i thought Autofac is still cool but then again i don't really like DI
[05:10:08] <Nasp> Ahh
[05:10:20] <Nasp> Well i prefer Autofac, but yeah
[05:10:38] <Nasp> What do you use instead?
[05:10:45] <Suchiman> nothing? static classes ftw! xD
[05:11:43] <Nasp> Really?

[05:16:21] <Nasp> NAzi*
[05:16:32] <Suchiman> Nasp: gooooood
[05:16:42] <Nasp> Can't figure out if i should allow single line returns for if statements
[05:16:44] <Suchiman> Nasp: note that VS can export your local settings into an editorconfig
[05:16:45] <Nasp> And how i do it
[05:17:01] <Nasp> Hmm i kinda just started by coping settings from the docs
[05:17:37] <Suchiman> Nasp: https://welp.dev/devenv_2022-02-24_02-47-34.png
[05:18:40] <Nasp> Ahh yes
[05:19:15] <Nasp> So start with that and then editir it
[05:19:23] <Nasp> Is'nt there lots of settings that isn't in VS or have they finally added them all
[05:19:49] <Suchiman> Nasp: dunno
[05:20:49] <Nasp> Ohh the VS one has comments
[05:20:50] <Nasp> Nice
[05:20:54] <Nasp> When writing it to file
[05:21:29] <Suchiman> indeed
[05:21:32] <Nasp> That code style is a lot better than last i tried it, now it has examples for everything
[05:22:51] <Nasp> Hmm i can't get it to allow single line returns
[05:22:56] <Nasp> Not that i wan't it but i knows others do
[05:23:28] <Suchiman> Nasp: instead of editing the file, you can just edit in VS and then export :P
[05:23:50] <Nasp> Yes thats' what im doing
[05:23:51] <Nasp> Now
[05:23:56] <Nasp> After your screenshot
[05:24:05] <Suchiman> Nasp: hehehe
[05:24:09] <Nasp> I want missing brackets to be an error
[05:24:17] <Nasp> But maybe allow if (true) return false
[05:24:21] <Nasp> Because some people like that
[05:24:32] <Nasp> But if i can't do that then i'm going to force brackets  muhahaha
[05:24:38] <Nasp> Set as ERROR :D
[05:24:40] <Suchiman> Nasp: ohhh and they tuned their editorconfig editor in VS :D https://welp.dev/devenv_2022-02-24_02-54-31.png

[06:01:10] <Suchiman> doing a JakeSays impression when i see them checking in not properly formatted code
[06:01:13] <Nasp> Suchiman:  I set some of these editorconfig as errors
[06:01:29] <Nasp> I kinda want to set treatwarnings as errors
[06:01:34] <Suchiman> bpmedley: you can now also set VS to have code cleanup / formatting being run on save automatically
[06:01:37] <Nasp> But some times you do need them to work around stuff
[06:01:47] <Nasp> And having to ignore them all in code is worse in a way
[06:02:02] <bpmedley> Suchiman : However, are you saying there are not automated formatting done via hooks and all formatting should be complete before a commit?
[06:02:04] <Nasp> Only thing annoying about automatic code formatting, is if you want to make pretty commits
[06:02:30] <Suchiman> bpmedley: yeah, i feel like running dotnet format in a commit hook would be a bit evil
[06:02:57] <Suchiman> Nasp: if the codebase is already formatted though and everyone uses the same settings then commits should stay pretty :P
[06:03:05] <bpmedley> Suchiman : I agree with you almost all scenarios.  I enjoy using vim and code formatting manually.
[06:03:31] <Nasp> I made VS want this bracket style https://gist.github.com/toftware/ca74f2edcfad8bf296bff44135976f9b :(
[06:03:37] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Yeah almost
[06:03:54] <Nasp> Sometimes if you are making a larger change you may not want it to auto format it
[06:03:56] <Suchiman> Nasp: not like in our angular project where people were running around with different code formatting settings causing ts and html files to be broken from one line into severals, back and forth

[06:04:36] <Suchiman> lol neat
[06:04:45] <bpmedley> Nasp : That gist feels weird.  Why are sometimes brackets indented?
[06:04:46] <Nasp> Well i dont mind styling errors in the build server
[06:04:53] <Nasp> But please report them in stead of just "lol build failed"
[06:05:09] <Nasp> bpmedley:  Because that's what my editorconfig now allows it seems
[06:05:19] <bpmedley> Did you write the editorconfig?
[06:06:55] <Nasp> I used VS to generate it
[06:07:09] <Suchiman> bpmedley: gnu and whitesmiths codestyle are the pure devil
[06:07:13] <Suchiman> devil incarnate
[06:07:16] <bpmedley> Sounds like your environemtn is holding you back because the environment created itself..
[06:07:32] <bpmedley> Suchiman : gnu codestyle is weird, i agree
[06:07:53] <Nasp> I had a teacher that used it for C#
[06:07:56] <Nasp> And everyone hated him for it
[06:09:02] <Nasp> https://gist.github.com/toftware/0c0fee4d2f28a4aa606ceb719a655b7d I wonder where i fuuucked u

[06:13:40] <Nasp> Hmm wait that wasn't the on i was thinking of
[06:16:40] <bpmedley> Nasp : Now I understand, the bracket style gist was an unwanted change.
[06:16:43] <bpmedley> Correct?
[06:17:56] <Suchiman> bpmedley: well it was allowing all three of them without complaining which it shouldn't have i think :P
[06:18:08] <bpmedley> haha
[06:18:31] <Nasp> bpmedley:  Yes
[06:18:41] <bpmedley> Sounds frustrating
[06:18:44] <Nasp> Hmm that analyzer ca2245 is nice
[06:18:49] <Nasp> But i can't figure out how to elevate it to error
[06:19:13] <Nasp> Maybe i shoud test this with newer VS
[06:19:18] <Suchiman> Nasp: did you try opening the .editorconfig in VS and looking on the analyzer page?
[06:19:44] <Nasp> Okay now it does the righ indentation
[06:19:46] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Yes
[06:19:53] <Nasp> That's where i found that analyzer
[06:19:59] <Nasp> But it doesn't do newline after brackets

[07:44:01] <ezio> k.  Here I go again with another story about the dude in my office who is incompetent and doesn't want to work.
[07:45:30] <ezio> So we have these PDFs that have to be updated ad-infinitum.  And I get the feeling this dude just loves giving me a new batch so I have to do it all over again.
[07:46:00] <ezio> And the thing is, he names the files just random shit.  And I've told him 3294732097 times before: Can we agree on a naming convention.
[07:46:21] <ezio> So today he says he has another batch.  Same ones I've been doing over and over again.
[07:46:37] <ezio> And this time he asks me, "Is there any file naming convention that you would like?"
[07:47:19] <ezio> And I was like, "Sure!  Oh, thanks!  Can you name them the way we have in the database.  It makes it much easier to copy and I don't have to modify my copy scripts again."
[07:47:59] <ezio> "On second thought, you do the renaming.  If this were coming from a graphic-design company, they would name it whatever they want."

[07:48:58] <ezio> And this has been going on for years.
[07:50:41] <ezio> And so I message my supervisor, ever so politely, can you help me deal with this?  And my supervisor is super philosophical.  At first he thought I was complaining, and then he read through the chain that we had been sending back and forth after like the seventh correspondence, and he finally says to me ..
[07:51:10] <ezio> This isn't an angry discussion at all.
[07:51:53] <ezio> And I was like, "No!  It isn't.  Everything's going fine.  I just don't want to push back because I'd rather beat my head against a wall than argue with him."
[07:52:00] <ezio> And this has been going on so long.

[07:54:14] <ern> normal people with normal chain of thought can get instructions and adopt, maybe he has an intellectual difference?
[07:54:15] <ezio> Big philosophical email (my supervisor loves to write tomes) about unhappy.
[07:54:55] <ezio> "I don't even mean 'unhappy', but the first word that came to mind was upset and I knew that was too far, but even unhappy oversells it."
[07:55:15] <ezio> Hew tells me in another huge tome about how he discovered the word, "Disappointed."

[07:57:25] <ezio> I program a new automated system, furiously.  Made a whole new table scheme that he could update.  Sent out an email to everyone.  CC'd my boss.
[07:57:49] <ezio> Dude: Oh I don't want to touch the database.  I don't really know those tables at all.
[07:58:21] <ezio> Boss chimes in: Yeah he's right, James.  I wouldn't want him touching Production either.\
[07:58:31] <Suchiman> ezio: bahaha
[07:58:47] <ezio> Me: This has nothing to do with production.  This is all in the test environment.  But don't worry, I'm on it.
[08:00:50] <ezio> In like an 1h20m, I had a polished gem of a console where he could upload PDFs anytime he wanted and they would instantly become available in the test environment.  Sorted and excluded all the keys that he needed to upload, and a backup for those he hadn't uploaded yet, and time stamps so he could see when he uploaded the last one of that specific PDF.
[08:02:32] <ezio> He writes back in that email chain about how he can't figure out how the keys, which are in plain English, correlate with the files that he's making because he names all these files garbage shit.

[08:02:52] <ezio> I mean I didn't say that.

[08:04:52] <ezio> I was once telling him a story about one of my boys and his wife.  And I used the word "partner".  He got this sneering look on his face: "What is he gay?"
[08:04:58] <Nasp> Suchiman:  I can into an issue with properties, i want to force braces on newlines, but auto properties should be ok
[08:05:09] <ezio> ... "No.  He's straight."
[08:05:12] <Nasp> Also having braces on sameline is still allowed

[12:14:48] <canton7> tsujp, the thing between the < and > is a type, not a Type object

[12:18:10] <canton7> Think about it this way... If you do 'new List<int>().Add(3)', the compiler makes sure that '3' will actually go into the list -- if you do 'new List<int>().Add("test")', the compiler rejects it at compile-time. It can't do that if the type of elements in the list isn't known until runtime

[13:00:31] <eurogos> i spent ages working out how to drop all the FK, and have them reapplied etc
[13:01:20] <eurogos> but it seems that if I have more than one FK on a table to the same entity - sqlserver won't cascade update due to multiple cascade paths
[13:02:08] <eurogos> any way around this? my only option now seems to be 1) drop all FK 2) write a migration program in c# 3) re-apply FK and cross fingers

[13:50:18] <earthy> 'by the balls' is putting it a bit strongly. yes, energy will be more expensive. that's not going to kill the economies though.
[13:51:46] <Assault> bomb, just double checking, so are you saying that linking to Apache 2 license text is not enough, I have to include the actual text in my app?
[13:52:11] <earthy> Assault: that is entirely correct.
[13:52:17] <bomb> Assault nah, include the entire text
[13:52:29] <Assault> ok
[13:52:40] <earthy> Assault: furthermore, if the lib has a 'NOTICE' you'll have to post that notice visibly within the app somehwere
[13:52:43] <bomb> Assault either in a TXT file in your LICENSES dir, or inside your app in "about screen" in a text box
[13:52:51] <earthy> (an 'about' or 'help' box)
[13:54:12] <bomb> make sure it's clear that the license notice is related to the library you use
[13:54:21] <bomb> or people will confuse your app is licensed under Apache
[13:54:37] <Assault> hmm...my app IS open source, so doesnt it mean then that having the license text as part of the sources (so in LICENSES dir) is enough?
[13:54:55] <bomb> LICENSES dir
[13:55:06] <earthy> Assault: no. if the app has an 'about' somewhere, it also needs to show the NOTICE.
[13:55:11] <bomb> must be somewhere in the binary distribution, not only in the sources
[13:55:26] <Assault> ah ok
[13:55:38] <Assault> gotta add a textbox then
[13:55:39] <bomb> you can combine all 18 libs license notices in a single licenses.txt
[13:55:50] * earthy nods
[13:56:21] <Assault> ...and one more thing, if I have the license text in the about box, do I still have to have it also in the LICENCSE dir in the sources?
[13:56:44] <bomb> nah
[13:57:54] <earthy> Assault: I'm going to assume you don't distribute the external lib vendored in your sources... in that case, no. if you do vendor the lib's sources, then the license is in that subdir...
[13:59:03] <Assault> earthy, the lib im referring to is opencv, and its only part of the sources as compiled binary
[13:59:46] <earthy> Assault: so, you vendor opencv as a binary? well, then you'll have to include the corresponding license in your LICENSE dir.

[15:37:29] <fredrikhr> Assault, it's similar to a receipt at the supermarket. If you buy Duracell batteries the receipt will still show the name of the supermarket not Duracell. (Whether the supermarket is authorized to resell Duracell products is totally different issue that you as the supermarket customer don't have anything to do with)
[15:38:08] <bomb> fredrikhr what a weird analogy lol
[15:38:30] <Assault> fredrikhr, =)
[15:38:56] <fredrikhr> So if you produce software, it's you who license that software, in effect "re-selling" the other products of which your software is composed. Again whether you are actually allowed to re-sell other's code in your product is a totally different matter
[15:39:41] <fredrikhr> bomb, yeah... it was the best I could come up with:P
[15:40:48] <Assault> ok...and one more thing - I should probably state that im including apache 2 license tex because im using Open CV - the apache 2 license is not for my app...but thats the standard for that? Just add "Open CV - apache 2 license" as a title in the text boc in my about page?
[15:42:20] <fredrikhr> depends on whether the license you have for that other piece of software (Open CV appearently) requries attribution upon redistribution

[16:01:59] <bomb> it's important for your country to have a good software industry with attention to details

[16:04:51] <bomb> I feel it's gonna be more important due to the upcoming food crisis.
[16:04:59] <Assault> fredrikhr, no i mean how do I indicate that I am listing the apache 2 license text BECAUSE my app uses open CV...so it is not misinterpreted that my app uses apache 2 license
[16:07:10] <fredrikhr> Assault: you don't. You license your software as you like. BUT: If your software includes other software that you are not allowed to redistribute, you are in violation of that license
[16:08:47] <Assault> fredrikhr, well this is not about how I licence my SW, but the fact that my SW uses open CV. And it uses apache 2 license, so I must include the license text in my apps about page. But if I simply have the apache 2 license tect there, it might be interpreted so that my app itself uses apache 2 license.

[16:41:19] <MatthiasVance> So I was thinking, if someone fires a nuclear missile, how much fall out do you have if you blow it out of the sky?
[16:42:03] <Diablo-D3> not a lot
[16:42:05] <MatthiasVance> Diablo-D3: You mentioned to enforce a "no politics" rule before someone was talking about politics, why do you think it would be necessary?
[16:42:25] <Diablo-D3> you have someone on ignore?
[16:42:31] <MatthiasVance> No
[16:42:49] <canton7> Depends how high it is, perhaps? From my last trip to the Secret Nuclear Bunker, fallout comes from dust being sucked up from the ground, and then re-distributed over a wide area. If it's too high, I guess that can't happen
[16:42:52] <Diablo-D3> bomb and Assault were already discussing it
[16:43:08] <Diablo-D3> well theres also other issues
[16:43:25] <Diablo-D3> the bomb explosion itself causes more radioactive material than you started with
[16:43:40] <xb0o2> If you properly intercept said nuclear missile you don't get a nuclear explosion, no.
[16:43:48] <MatthiasVance> Bubble-gun
[16:43:59] <Diablo-D3> yeah, thats the point
[16:44:09] <Diablo-D3> intercepting it only has to deal with the fissile material of the warhead
[16:44:26] <Diablo-D3> which means its contained in a smaller area and theoretically is easier to deal with
[16:44:28] <MatthiasVance> Obviously both parties would see a counter-missile being fired and could explode it remotely
[16:44:28] <xb0o2> You'd actually want the smallest explosive that can reliably destroy the missile it's intercepting to reduce the spread of debris.
[16:44:32] <Diablo-D3> the warhead might not even be cracked
[16:45:15] <Diablo-D3> but yeah, I dont think anyone in russia will follow that order
[16:45:23] <xb0o2> MatthiasVance: what if the counter missile was covered in screens that showed a feed of a camera from the other side?
[16:45:32] <xb0o2> Nobody would be able to see it.
[16:45:33] <xb0o2> Easy.
[16:45:42] <MatthiasVance> xb0o2: Seeing != detecting ;)
[16:45:54] <Diablo-D3> we dont do visual detection anymore
[16:45:57] <xb0o2> Well you said see so ;-)
[16:46:00] <Diablo-D3> its all radar and IR nowadays
[16:46:06] <MatthiasVance> xb0o2: See on radar etc
[16:46:10] <Diablo-D3> missiles are incredibly IR bright
[16:46:18] <xb0o2> Well now that's cheating
[16:46:37] <xb0o2> I think we should do the screens anyway. Just in case anyone is out with their binoculars.
[16:49:08] <Diablo-D3> but yeah, russian ICBMs are really hard to deal with
[16:49:15] <MatthiasVance> Why?
[16:49:23] <bomb> wot did I du?
[16:49:23] <Diablo-D3> it isnt a single missile you have to deal with
[16:50:14] <bomb> Russia entered Kiev
[16:51:01] <MatthiasVance> Diablo-D3: Oh!
[16:51:14] <MatthiasVance> So it's more about the type of missile and less about the contents
[16:51:36] <MatthiasVance> Also you can fire a missile and have it reach the other end of the earth in 30 mins?? :o
[16:52:18] <Diablo-D3> yes, or your next missile is free
[16:52:27] <MatthiasVance> I had no idea they were that fast
[16:52:49] <Diablo-D3> but yeah, mirv icbms are a pita

[18:19:16] <MatthiasVance> Less indenting = better :D
[18:19:27] <Suchiman> Xenoprimate: because it requires me to write class Program and static void Main manually :P

[18:21:58] <Suchiman> neat
[18:22:13] <canton7> Less of a proposal at this point, heh. It's implemented and used in the BCL
[18:23:04] <Suchiman> indeed
[18:23:04] <Xenoprimate> I think it's a good idea. Lots of people on reddit upset about the syntax

[18:34:33] <Xenoprimate> Suchiman, I guess I'm old or too stupid but I'm struggling to remember them all, and each syntax brings new mental overhead. It's exactly what I didn't like about C++
[18:34:41] <Xenoprimate> The new ones proposed for C# 11 are what I'm mostly talking about
[18:35:17] <Xenoprimate> [1, .. var middle, _] => $"Middle {String.Join(", ", middle)}",
[18:35:22] <Xenoprimate> Like that (in a switch pattern)
[18:35:34] <bomb> C++ sucks balls, and C# is going that direction
[18:35:38] <Suchiman> Xenoprimate: yeah i guess it makes C# much harder to approach for newbies, meanwhile we're being eased in with continous improvement
[18:35:55] <Xenoprimate> I mean, it's not like us pros don't have to put the work in
[18:36:09] <Xenoprimate> I'm just not sure what value more new syntaxes like that really add

[20:53:09] <MatthiasVance> ah
[20:53:17] <pitfall> Suchiman oh, right, it was going to go up to 60%ish, but didn't (yet)?

[21:14:01] <pitfall> I'll just kiss my wife one last time
[21:14:47] <pitfall> won't be time for anything else

[21:18:16] <Suchiman> me personally, i don't know yet, will prolly be a split second decision, like can i be arsed to live in an post apocalyptic world? will prolly die anyway within the next half year if i can't get my hands on insulin anymore. Might as well just go in style when the shockwave hits
[21:18:32] <brianonymous_> id try just for the challenge, lawl

[21:20:27] <bomb> 150 bucks lol
[21:20:53] <interop_madness> brianonymous_, what mSv range?
[21:21:17] * interop_madness always wanted a geiger counter with a range going into full Sieverts
[21:21:19] <brianonymous_>  0 ~ 42500uSv/h
[21:21:39] <Suchiman> interop_madness: seems kinda pointless :P
[21:21:42] <brianonymous_> its a dual tube model, so its supposed to be pretty sensitive, cuz i actually do want to do a lil science too
[21:22:16] <interop_madness> ok, so it call tell you that you will die of cancer, but it can't tell you that you will die from acute radiation syndrome ^^
[21:23:10] <brianonymous_> well, if im using it for that i can just assume that if its maxed out, i probably should go hide in a hole in the ground
[21:23:24] <interop_madness> Suchiman, yeah, it's not exactly actionable information to learn that you absorbed 7Sv, but OTOH I would like that in writing if it ever came to this ^^
[21:24:02] <Suchiman> interop_madness: i mean, i guess it makes it easier to find the source so you can die quicker

[21:27:01] <Suchiman> bomb: it's not active, they're just working there to contain the leakage still
[21:27:16] <bomb> ah
[21:28:24] <interop_madness> Fun fact: The radiation has about halved since the accident in 1986
[21:29:02] <interop_madness> CS-137 (the predominant isotope remaining) has a half life of 30y

[21:29:55] <bomb> lz_ screw these warmongers. tell me about your new Tinder adventures
[21:30:00] <interop_madness> The predominant isotope nowadays. Of course, in the early hours it was I-131
[21:30:00] <lz_> reading ppl saying they're 100% convinced there's going to be a nuclear war, doesn't help
[21:30:31] <interop_madness> You're right, i should keep this to myself

[21:32:32] <DevJohnC> it's a common misconception that if, say, the USA and Russia went to war we'd open with nukes
[21:32:56] <DevJohnC> the real nuclear threat is when one side is desperate to not lose but is actively losing
[21:33:15] <lz_> Suchiman: yeah, still putin is threatening doing it. maybe we should instantly nuke whoever threatens nuclear war
[21:33:30] <interop_madness> Nuclear war would start with small-scale tactical weapons

[21:34:38] <DevJohnC> the thing that scares me is Russia invading Ukraine feels very similar to Germany's unchecked aggression into Poland back in the day
[21:34:56] <interop_madness> Here's a scenario how it could have played out in the 1980s: https://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/nuclearwar1.html
[21:34:58] <DevJohnC> if the aggression isn't stopped it'll continue, and it gets worse
