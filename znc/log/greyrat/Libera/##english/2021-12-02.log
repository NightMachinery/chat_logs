[00:14:40] <ash_worksi> really dumb question: I got a gift from a store say BB&B, from a friend say Tiffany; and then got a coupon from BB&B addressed to Tiffany (whom doesn't live as close as even in the same region)... I don't think this is what BB&B was doing, but if I wanted to incentize people who received gifts to shop at BB&B without knowing the actual recipients name (for some unbelievable reason) but wanted it more 
[00:14:46] <ash_worksi> personal than "Tiffany or Current Resident" ... how would you describe a party having "some relationship" with Tiffany? You could say "Friend of Tiffany" but how would you know it's a friend? and "Related to Tiffany" sounds like you're in the family

[01:18:16] <bleb> The sentence structure I wanted was to begin with "a common view of users and channels" either in block quote or inline, then comment on it.
[01:20:04] <jemius> How about introducing the whole quote first and then referencing the sub-part again in the following sentence? "This 'common view of users and channels' is, however, totally awesome. Yeah."

[01:21:41] <bleb> I am commenting on a number of such phrases, so it feels much more readable to put the phrase on its own rather than working it into a grammatical sentence.
[01:22:28] <TimMc> Oh, it's not that the original is ungrammatical?
[01:22:34] <bleb> So I wonder if there are guidelines for punctuation/capitalization/quoting when using a structure like that.
[01:24:00] <bleb> TimMc: What I meant is that the phrase is not treated grammatically in the sentence, bad wording on my part.
[01:24:58] <bleb> It would probably be safe to block quote it but I wonder if there are best practices for when the markup doesn't allow block quotes.
[01:25:30] <bleb> Or if you are using a similar construct where block quotes would be too disruptive.
[01:25:49] <bleb> Like do you capitalize the first letter of the fragment, if it is not capitalized in the text?
[01:26:02] <bleb> Do you add a period at the end?

[01:29:02] <bleb> Feels semantically different from block quoting due to the colon, but maybe there is no way to replicate the same semantics inline.
[01:35:00] <TimMc> « Email, like IRC, has "a common view of users and channels"—except the names of users yada yada yada »
[01:38:05] <TimMc> I would integrate it into the structure of the surrounding sentence using whatever glue is necessary. :-)
[01:39:18] <TimMc> Sometimes you need to alter a word in the quote to singular or plural, or change the tense, and in that case you need to surround the altered part with [square brackets] to indicate that it is not directly from the original.

[07:31:45] <mdogg> ghen: When quoting somebody, you include the punctuation within the quotation.  For example:  
[07:31:45] <mdogg> Pretty
[07:31:45] <mdogg> soon Jim says:
[07:31:45] <mdogg> “Say, who is you?  Whar is you?  Dog my cats ef I didn’ hear sum-
[07:31:45] <mdogg> f ’n.  Well,  I  know  what  I’s  gwyne  to  do:  I’s  gwyne  to  set  down  here
[07:31:45] <mdogg> and listen tell I hears it agin.”
[07:31:56] <Me-me> ghen: The formal way of doing it is too awkard in modern parlance. Nowadays you would go with what makes sense from the natural intonation of the sentence. For that reason, "Did you ever have a name, you wonder?" and "Did you ever have a name, you wonder." Are both valid.
[07:32:16] <mdogg> Chapter 2, "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"
[07:33:03] <Me-me> As mdogg insinuates, technically you're quoting someone. So, formally, you would write it as "Did you ever have a name?" you wonder.
[07:33:27] <Me-me> But that just looks weird these days, I think.
[07:34:18] <mdogg> Looks weird?  How else would you write it?
[07:34:43] <Me-me> "Did you ever have a name, you wonder?" or "Did you ever have a name, you wonder."
[07:34:48] <ghen> Actually, then it should be ' "Did *I ever have a name?" you wonder.' or something like that.
[07:35:00] <Me-me> Right, yes, different context within the quote. My mistake.
[07:35:19] <ghen> But it's subtly different
[07:35:41] <ghen> I think "Did you ever have a name, you wonder" can be correct, withoout internal quotes
[07:35:59] <Me-me> It's all about communicating with the reader. In the second person, you might want to make it more personal than a direct quotation, and rather, an abstracted one.
[07:36:01] <mdogg> ghen: What did the person ask exactly?
[07:36:07] <mdogg> "Did you ever have a name?"
[07:36:29] <ghen> the person is asking themselves if they ever had a name
[07:36:33] <Me-me> mdogg: I believe it's more about letting the reader know about the wondering, as opposed to the question.
[07:36:35] <mdogg> Oooh
[07:36:42] <mdogg> Ok.  Then
[07:36:43] <Me-me> Second person writing is difficult for this and many other reasons.
[07:36:57] <mdogg> "Did I ever have a name?" I asked myself.
[07:37:05] <Me-me> That's first person.
[07:37:09] <Vyrus> the reason stephen king is so renowned is because of his descriptors 
[07:37:18] <Me-me> The original sentence is second person.
[07:37:39] <Me-me> Vyrus: I thought Stephen King was so renowned because of his unparalleled prolific output.
[07:37:45] <mdogg> "Did you ever have a name?" I asked myself.
[07:37:58] *** solveig is now known as pennylane
[07:37:59] <mdogg> Either way, the question is quoted.
[07:38:01] <Me-me> mdogg: The quote is in second person, but the sentence is still first person.
[07:38:23] <Vyrus> still true 
[07:38:47] <ghen> But if the narrator is telling the reader that they wondered if they ever had a name, I think quotes aren't necessary
[07:38:56] <mdogg> Whatever the person, there needs to be punctuation at the end of whatever is quoted.  
[07:39:01] <ghen> but maybe
[07:39:04] <ghen> maybe i'm wrong
[07:39:04] <mdogg> And if it's a question there should be a question mark.
[07:39:12] <Me-me> I disagree with mdogg here.
[07:39:16] <ghen> Did he ever have a name, he wondered
[07:39:24] <Me-me> I believe that the formal way he is describing is not communicative in modern parlance.
[07:39:26] <mdogg> That's a question.
[07:39:42] <Vyrus> "**** wondered if the man had ever even been given a name"
[07:39:47] <ghen> where '"Did I ever have a name" he wondered' should be in quotes
[07:39:58] <mdogg> If you're writing a story, submit it with a period and your editor will add the question mark before it's published.  Done deal.
[07:40:22] <ouzel8___> Can someone please explain to me what is a submodifier.
[07:40:22] <mdogg> 'he wondered' should NOT be in quotes.
[07:40:24] <Vyrus> - the even idk why my brain did that
[07:40:24] <Me-me> Vyrus: That's changing the structure of the sentence.
[07:40:25] <mdogg> What are you saying?
[07:40:36] <Me-me> .w submodifier
[07:40:37] <tinsoldier> submodifier — Noun: 1. A subordinate modifier https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/submodifier
[07:40:46] <Me-me> Thanks wiktionary.
[07:41:30] <ghen> 'he wondered' isn't in quotes, sorry, I mixed up the single quotes and double quotes.  It should have been "'Did he ever have a name' he wondered"
[07:41:38] <Me-me> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsective_modifier
[07:41:43] <mdogg> Show me a published work where "he wondered" or "she said" was in quotes.
[07:41:50] <Me-me> mdogg nobody is arguing that.
[07:41:54] <mdogg> oh ok.
[07:42:17] <ghen> I didn't put it in quotes
[07:42:27] <ghen> I was quoting the entire thing, not just that part
[07:42:42] <ghen> since it was an example
[07:42:45] <mdogg> Sorry..  
[07:42:51] <mdogg> I misunderstood.  
[07:42:57] <ghen> damn right
[07:43:04] <Me-me> There were two levels of quotes: Quoting the sentence from the implied text, and quoting the speaker of the question. Which I still believe is not necessary.
[07:43:08] <ghen> (jk)
[07:43:56] <ghen> "Did you ever have a name, you wonder?" is probably what I'm going for
[07:44:06] <mdogg> When I type 'man ban' in a terminal it says "no manual entry for ban."  =P
[07:44:17] <ghen> But it might rub people the wrong way, but there's probably no avoiding that in an awkward case like that
[07:44:29] <Me-me> Like I said. These days it's about the natural inflection. With or without the question mark is valid, I feel, but either way it's a comma after the question itself.
[07:44:57] <mdogg> ghen: "Did you ever have a name?" you wonder.  
[07:45:09] <mdogg> You wonder isn't something that you say outloud.
[07:45:18] <mdogg> Or to yourself.
[07:45:23] <ouzel8___> Can someone please demonstrate the usage of a submodifier in a sentence?
[07:45:24] <ghen> unless you rephrase it similarly to what mdogg put
[07:45:25] <Me-me> Again, mdogg, that's not an actual quote within the text - that is a quote of the text.
[07:45:42] <mdogg> ghen: Or if you have an untreated psychological condition. 
[07:45:44] <Me-me> We are using quotes here in ##english because the chatroom is not the work of writing that ghen will be placing that text into.
[07:46:05] <ghen> but then it should be: "'Did I ever have a name?' you wonder."
[07:46:14] <mdogg> oh dear.
[07:46:59] <mdogg> "Why am I still awake?" I ask myself.
[07:47:07] <mdogg> Not "Why am I still awake I ask myself?"
[07:47:28] <Me-me> Why am I still awake, I ask myself.
[07:47:35] <LjL> ↑
[07:47:39] <LjL> i do
[07:47:40] <ghen> "He wondered if he ever had a name" or "Did he ever have a name, he wondered"
[07:47:42] <Me-me> Or indeed:
[07:47:44] <Me-me> Why am I still awake, I ask myself?
[07:47:55] <mdogg> ghen: Neither of those are correct.  
[07:48:00] <ghen> or "'Did I ever have a name', he wondered."
[07:48:20] <ghen> "He wondered if he ever had a name" is definitely correct
[07:48:21] <mdogg> ghen:  "Did I ever have a name?" I wondered.
[07:48:26] <ghen> Or that
[07:48:28] <Me-me> I respectfully disagree with mdogg. Though he's correct about the formal structure, the application of that formal structure is itself invalid in modern parlance.
[07:48:40] <mdogg> You can't change the person.
[07:48:55] <ghen> but if it were third person, it would be correct
[07:49:07] <ghen> it's an analog
[07:49:09] <mdogg> If he's asking himself about whether he had a name in the first person then he needs to keep his wondering in the first person.
[07:49:43] <ghen> depends on if the narrator has an omniscient perspective
[07:50:02] <ghen> "he wondered if he ever had a name" would be valid if the story is written in third person
[07:50:05] <mdogg> Oh, Ok...
[07:50:18] <mdogg> "Did I ever really have a name?"  The man wondered.
[07:50:24] <mdogg> That makes sense.
[07:50:26] <ghen> That is also valid
[07:50:28] <mdogg> If it's a narritve.
[07:50:42] <ghen> though I think "The" shouldn't be capitalized?
[07:50:59] <mdogg> In either case, you don't include his pondering in the quotation. 
[07:51:03] <Me-me> Correct, it would be "[...] the man wondered."
[07:51:12] <ghen> my philosophy is that punctuation is about aesthetics 
[07:51:17] *** Quits: Xavier7 (~ircap@179.6.137.60) (Quit:  IRcap  8.72 )
[07:51:23] <mdogg> No bro. 
[07:51:28] <Me-me> I wouldn't say it's about aesthetics so much as communication.
[07:51:36] <ouzel8___> I do not consider it correct to quote the narrative.
[07:51:42] *** Joins: fstd_ (~fstd@xdsl-81-173-139-70.nc.de)
[07:51:44] <Me-me> Aesthetic-focused linguistics is how you get Driss't Do'urden.
[07:51:56] <Me-me> Drizz't? Some ridiculous apostrophe-laden naming scheme.
[07:52:02] <ghen> just punctuation
[07:52:09] <ghen> imo
[07:52:12] <Me-me> It's a slipper slope my friend.
[07:52:17] <ghen> lol
[07:52:21] <Me-me> s/pper/ppery/
[07:52:21] <chat> Me-me meant to say: It's a slippery slope my friend.
[07:53:42] <ghen> ouzel8___, so you would consider "'Did I ever have a name?' he wondered." to be incorrect?
[07:54:01] <mdogg> “Hey yourself,” said Jem pleasantly.
[07:54:01] <mdogg> “I’m Charles Baker Harris,” he said. “I can read.”
[07:54:01] <mdogg> “So what?” I said.
[07:54:07] <ouzel8___> Yes
[07:54:11] <mdogg> "To Kill a Mockingbird"
[07:54:36] <Me-me> mdogg that text is 60 years old. Language marches on.
[07:54:45] <mdogg> You are so wrong.
[07:54:57] <Me-me> And in any case, it's not the same context.
[07:54:59] *** Quits: fstd (~fstd@xdsl-87-79-98-69.nc.de) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[07:55:18] <Me-me> Those are out loud spoken words, said to other persons, and given in the context of a conversation.
[07:55:46] <mdogg> Language does evolve.  I agree with that.  But the format for writing properly is still the same.
[07:55:47] <Me-me> ghen's character's statement is all but an internal dialogue. It's got a different narrative connotation to it, and is spoken with a different intonation as a result.
[07:56:11] <ghen> regardless, "Jim wondered if Charles Baker heard the mockingbird" would be correct.  One wouldn't need to write "Jim wondered, 'Did Charles Baker hear the mockingbird'."
[07:56:26] <ghen> at least not necessarily
[07:56:36] <ghen> though some may prefer the latter form
[07:56:42] <mdogg> You quote the internal dialogue.  The internal dialogue does not include "I thought to myself".
[07:57:05] <Me-me> You do not quote the internal dialogue.
[07:57:25] *** Quits: Vyrus (~Username@208-122-122-82.t3com.net) (Quit: Vyrus)
[07:57:34] <ghen> I think it can be either, correctly, it depends on aesthetic preference
[07:57:49] <ghen> which gives the writer liberty to express themselves in different ways
[07:57:51] <Me-me> All point-of-view writing is internal dialogue. To add quotes to some of it and not others is madness.
[07:57:53] <mdogg> "Why am I getting so frustrated I asked myself?" I asked myself.  
[07:58:02] <mdogg> That makes no sense either.
[07:58:04] <Me-me> That's not what we're suggesting, mdogg.
[07:58:33] <ghen> I never quoted the "I asked myself" part at any point in time - just sayin'
[07:59:07] <ouzel8___> "A fragment of a human expression that is repeated by somebody else, for example from literature or a famous speech." See https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/quotation
[07:59:08] <Me-me> Indeed. I think you are again getting confused by the fact that we are placing quotation marks around the parts that are going in the text, as opposed to things we are stating sincerely as our own words.
[07:59:09] <mdogg> Well, it is not approporiate to say that something published by Harper Lee is not relevant because it's 60 years old.
[07:59:45] <Me-me> Shakespeare remains one of the most popular authors of all time. Should I then go back and correct your grammar based on his?
[07:59:56] <mdogg> Exactly.
[08:00:03] <Me-me> Alright. One moment.
[08:00:23] <mdogg> I'm not speaking in iambic pentameter. 
[08:00:47] <ouzel8___> Examples of this would be a fragment i.e. word taken from a text, or what somebody has said.
[08:00:50] <Me-me> Well, in any case, that was one line of my disagreement and you have failed to address the next.
[08:01:14] *** Quits: powermail (uid385576@id-385576.uxbridge.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[08:01:47] <mdogg> The thought or the dialogue should be included in the quotation.  Not the portion of who thought of it or who actually said it.
[08:02:03] <ghen> I think we are all agreed on that
[08:02:10] <ghen> mdogg
[08:02:10] <mdogg> I hope so.
[08:03:45] <ouzel8___> mdogg, I agree the source should not be included in the quotation.
[08:04:01] <Me-me> Nobody is saying that! Nobody has suggested that thus far in this conversation, even ironically!
[08:04:36] *** Joins: powermail (uid385576@id-385576.uxbridge.irccloud.com)
[08:05:09] <ghen> We could suggest it ironically though
[08:05:09] <mdogg> I do understand and realize that the English language has evolved over time.  But I also deal with people who think that it has evolved to the point where wring things like "Will u go 2 the store 4 me?"  That type of shit is absolutely unacceptable. 
[08:05:13] <ghen> that wold be funny
[08:05:24] <ghen> imo anyway
[08:05:29] <ghen> but i have a weird sense of humor
[08:05:30] <pennylane> That is how
[08:05:33] <pennylane> It happens, sadly
[08:05:45] <Me-me> ghen: Only in the context of us being able to laugh about it later. Right now, I'm just frustrated.
[08:05:49] <pennylane> What can we do about it? I mean I'm not a native speaker
[08:06:09] <pennylane> It happens to every language in this world I guess.
[08:06:19] <pennylane> However I must say and agree with you. It is sad.
[08:06:59] <ouzel8___> I disagree that you would quote somebodies thought.
[08:07:05] <pennylane> A beautiful language used in this form of way that is just not...properly neither beautiful, correct. We even have a song about this where I'm from...somebody who "murdered" the grammar.
[08:08:16] <ouzel8___> That is slang, it is just abbreviation, and should not be considered change in the language.
[08:08:31] <pennylane> Oops I did it again
[08:08:33] <mdogg> ouzel8___: 'She thought' or 'he said' or 'he wrote'  -- nothing like that would be included in quotes.
[08:08:53] <pennylane> The song's lyrics is the equivalent to the grammar was somehow "mugged", logics was the one murdered.
[08:09:25] <mdogg> ouzel8___: And you can quote me on that.  =P
[08:09:34] <ghen> ouzel8___, I think one could.  For example: "He thought to himself: 'I wonder if Franchesca has a boyfriend'." could be correct.
[08:09:52] <mdogg> "'She thought' or 'he said' or 'he wrote'  -- nothing like that would be included in quotes." mdogg said.
[08:09:59] <ghen> Or you could put the double quote inside the period if you wanted
[08:10:14] <Me-me> mdogg: For the fifth time, nobody has said that they ought to be.
[08:10:15] <ghen> mdogg, that isn't what ouzel8___ was talking about
[08:10:17] <ouzel8___> mdogg: The source should appear separately from the quotation.
[08:10:35] <ghen> well, maybe it was
[08:10:44] <ghen> maybe we're all misunderstanding what mdogg is saying
[08:11:28] <Me-me> ghen: No, I think we're all just talking around each other.
[08:11:33] <ghen> ouzel is saying that they think it's only correct to not quote thoughts, therefore it should be "He wondered if Franchesca had a boyfriend" is the only correct way to word it, if I understand correctly.
[08:11:59] <ghen> or at least something similar to that, without internal quotes
[08:12:35] <ghen> mdogg is misunderstanding
[08:12:44] <mdogg> Well, he wondered if Frachecha had a boyfriend isn't a quote.
[08:13:00] <ghen> mdogg, when one quotes something that could be said, one would put the whole thing in quotes
[08:13:10] <mdogg> Yes.
[08:13:12] <ghen> it should be, actually
[08:13:45] <mdogg> ghen: No it's shouldn't.  It's a statement not something someone said.
[08:14:00] <ouzel8___> No, instead what I mean is that typically people quote a text or speech.
[08:14:11] <ghen> ouzel8___, linked the wikipedia article on the matter
[08:14:27] <ghen> he is correct
[08:14:31] <ghen> i believe 
[08:14:44] <gry> "Bananas awe awesome", she said.
[08:14:53] <Me-me> *are
[08:14:59] <gry> yup
[08:15:20] <mdogg> I wonder whether you are all drunk.  Now, if you were to tell somebody else about my current feelings, all you would say to them is, "mdogg wonders whether or not we are all drunk."  But you don't have to include the quotes or quote me on that.
[08:15:26] <mdogg> You could just say that I'm wondering that.
[08:16:03] <ghen> if you're talking about something you could hypothetically say, you should quote it
[08:16:15] <gry> quotes are optional
[08:16:21] <ghen> mdogg, exactly
[08:16:28] <mdogg> However, if you wanted to quote me, you would put:  Then mdogg replied, "I wonderwhether you are all drunk."
[08:16:30] <ghen> you would quote the whole thing
[08:16:32] <gry> usually more essential when the quote is long and when it is not paraphrased
[08:16:55] <ghen> you quoted "mdogg wonders ..."
[08:17:01] <ghen> included the wondering
[08:17:12] <mdogg> Because that's what I said.
[08:17:14] <ghen> therefore you agree with ouzel8___ on the matter
[08:17:32] <mdogg> Are you all drunk?
[08:17:37] <mdogg> That's different.
[08:17:48] <mdogg> "Are you all drunk?" I wondered.
[08:18:34] <ghen> you put the quotes in the same place we would
[08:18:37] <ghen> so we're agreed
[08:19:38] <ghen> except ouzel8___ thinks that thoughts should never be quoted, even internally, whereas mdogg thinks they always should be, so there's that
[08:19:56] <ghen> but regarding the subject of quoting hypothetical statements, we're all agreed on the matter
[08:19:58] <mdogg> I'm not trying to be cantankerous.  
[08:20:22] <mdogg> I'm not saying that thoughts should always be quoted.  
[08:20:45] <mdogg> It depends on what type of writing you're doing.
[08:21:03] <ghen> that was my understanding, based on what you said earlier
[08:22:16] <mdogg> Is it a story that is written from the 3rd person or the 1st person?
[08:22:22] <ghen> since you said, "'Did you ever have a name?' I asked myself."
[08:22:56] <mdogg> That's 3rd person.
[08:22:58] <ghen> and "Either way, the question is quoted."
[08:23:02] <Me-me> Now again, I want to point out how the "I asked myself." is only in quotes because it's part of what ghen is quoting, not because it is part of the quote to which that clause refers.
[08:23:15] <mdogg> No, because if it's a first person event then I'm not going to quote myself.
[08:23:26] <mdogg> I'll just explain it from my perspective.
[08:23:34] <mdogg> Not from an abstract 3rd person's perspective.
[08:24:17] <ghen> mdogg, to answer your question, the "story" I am working on is meant to be in second person, but I was quoting you from earlier.
[08:25:11] <mdogg> Then you should put whatever your talking about in quotes.  And who said (or thought about) what should not be included in the quotes. 
[08:26:28] <ghen> that's incorrect
[08:26:35] <ghen> i think you don't know how to use internal quotes
[08:27:26] <mdogg> Give an example.
[08:27:59] <mdogg> Not a wiki article of how they're used, but an actual publication of what you're talking about.
[08:28:15] <ghen> do you see where you said ""Are you all drunk?" I wondered."?
[08:28:22] <mdogg> Yep
[08:28:58] <ghen> the correct way to punctuate that would be "'Are you all drunk?' I wondered."  Notice the single quotation marks replace the double quotation marks in the internal quotes.
[08:28:58] <mdogg> But I didn't quote I wonderedI
[08:29:10] <mdogg> ghen: You are completely incorrect about that.
[08:29:12] <ghen> I am quoting the whole thing though.
[08:29:48] <Me-me> Now again, I want to point out how the "I asked myself." is only in quotes because it's part of what ghen is quoting, not because it is part of the quote to which that clause refers.
[08:29:51] <ghen> It's how I was taught in high school
[08:29:59] <mdogg> Well, you were taught incorrectly.
[08:30:06] <Me-me> No, he wasn't.
[08:30:12] <mdogg> First of all, you can't say "I wonderd" since you didn't wonder, *I* did.
[08:30:21] <Me-me> That's why it's part of the quote.
[08:30:28] <Me-me> It's in the first person from your perspective.
[08:30:29] <ghen> I am quoting your statement
[08:30:39] <Me-me> Just like this statement is for me.
[08:30:42] <ghen> The whole thing should be in quotes because it is what you said
[08:31:02] <ghen> it would be incorrect not to put what I am quoting of what you said within the quotes
[08:31:28] <mdogg> You would write:  "Are you all drunk?" mdogg wondered.  
[08:31:54] <mdogg> Or, "Are you all drunk?" mdogg asked.
[08:32:18] <mdogg> That would be more correct since you don't control the operation of somebody elses mind.
[08:32:23] <ghen> We are talking about quoting a statement that contains a quote
[08:32:35] <mdogg> And my quote was, "Are you all drunk?"
[08:32:44] <ghen> that's not the same thing
[08:32:54] <mdogg> Or you could quote the other way I phrased it:
[08:32:56] <ghen> you're talking about something different
[08:33:06] <ghen> or you're making it too difficult to understand you, in my opinion
[08:33:07] <mdogg> mdogg asked, "I wonder if you are all drunk."
[08:33:19] <ghen> We are talking about quoting a statement that contains a quote
[08:33:35] <mdogg> Are you all drunk?
[08:33:38] <mdogg> Quote me on that.
[08:33:54] <mdogg> As if you were including that in a sotry.
[08:33:55] <mdogg> story.
[08:34:27] <ghen> Said the pot to kettle
[08:34:29] <mdogg> There are only a few ways to do that.  
[08:34:46] <mdogg> mdogg asked, "Are you all drunk?" 
[08:34:48] <mdogg> Or
[08:34:53] <ghen> You just don't know how to use internal quotes
[08:34:56] <mdogg> "Are you all drunk?" asked mdogg
[08:35:16] <mdogg> ghen: So what am I missing?
[08:35:23] <ghen> We are talking about quoting a statement that contains a quote
[08:35:37] <ghen> Pick something that someone said that CONTAINS A QUOTE
[08:35:59] <mdogg> Ok.  
[08:36:00] <ghen> and then quote the entire statement, internal quote included
[08:36:48] <mdogg> Neil Armstrong said, "One small step for man; one giant leap for mankind."
[08:36:59] <ghen> that is not what we are talking about
[08:37:06] <ghen> that contains no internal quote
[08:37:11] <mdogg> Then I have no idea what you're on about..
[08:37:17] <ghen> there are many examples in this chat
[08:37:42] <ghen> mdogg said ""Are you all drunk?" asked mdogg", is an example.
[08:37:42] <mdogg> So give me one.
[08:37:50] <mdogg> Dude.
[08:37:59] <mdogg> That makes no sense.
[08:38:09] <ghen> correctness aside, do you see the internal quotes?
[08:38:20] <mdogg> No I don't.  That makes no sense at all.
[08:38:24] <ghen> do you see that I am quoting something you said which has internal quotes?
[08:38:27] <mdogg> Internal quotes?
[08:38:34] <ghen> your statement contained a quote
[08:39:06] <mdogg> Internal quotes would be, "mdogg posted the following:  "Neil Armstrong said, "One small step for man; one giant leap for mankind.""
[08:39:22] <mdogg> Actually no.
[08:39:27] <mdogg> It would be
[08:39:40] <ghen> no...
[08:39:47] <mdogg> mdogg posted the following:  "Neil Armstrong said, "One small step for man; one giant leap for mankind.""
[08:40:10] <mdogg> That is how you quote a quote.
[08:40:15] <ghen> You would substitute an apostrophe (called single quotation marks in these cases) for the double quotation marks
[08:40:27] <mdogg> Ok fine.  
[08:40:36] <mdogg> mdogg posted the following:  '"Neil Armstrong said, "One small step for man; one giant leap for mankind."'
[08:41:00] <ghen> The internal quotation marks should be single, not the outer quotation marks - those should be normal double quotation marks
[08:41:02] <mdogg> Either way "mdogg said" or "asked mdogg" is not included in the quote.
[08:41:14] <ghen> I never did 
[08:41:24] <mdogg> [2021-12-01 21:07:42] <ghen> mdogg said ""Are you all drunk?" asked mdogg", is an example.
[08:41:38] <ghen> scroll up and reread what I said
[08:41:40] <ghen> omg
[08:42:00] <ghen> bthen scroll up to where you said ""Are you all drunk?" asked mdogg"
[08:42:04] <ghen> because you did
[08:42:09] <ghen> you included it
[08:42:18] <ghen> you said "asked mdogg"
[08:42:33] <mdogg> heh
[08:42:35] <mdogg> no i didn't.
[08:42:36] <ghen> therefore, when I quoted you, I included that within the quotes, because you said it
[08:42:40] <ghen> fine
[08:42:43] <ghen> then I was wrong
[08:42:47] <ghen> but if you had, then I would be correct
[08:42:55] <mdogg> No it would not.
[08:43:15] <mdogg> Oh, if I had.. ok
[08:43:25] <mdogg> If you had then you would be correct because I would have been incorrect.
[08:44:08] <mdogg> Said mdogg, or asked mdogg, or thought mdogg - none of that should be quoted.
[08:44:32] <ghen> generally speaking, you are correct
[08:44:43] <ghen> the exception is if it was contained in the statement being quoted
[08:44:57] <ghen> but generally speaking i 100% agree
[08:45:42] <ghen> for example, if I wanted to quote your statement about what Neil Armstrong said, "Neil Armstrong said ..." would be included within the quotes.
[08:46:14] <ghen> if I am attributing the entire statement to you
[08:46:16] <mdogg> Give your example.
[08:46:20] <mdogg> The whole thing.
[08:46:36] <ghen> there is also a difference in quoting something hypothetically, and then just saying it
[08:47:15] <mdogg> mdogg said, "Neil Armstrong said 'One small step for man; one giant leap for mankind.""
[08:47:17] <ghen> but then we would get into triple quoting
[08:47:25] <ghen> exactly
[08:47:49] <mdogg> Actually, i should be 
[08:47:53] <mdogg> mankind.'"
[08:47:54] <ghen> mdogg said "Neil Armstrong said, 'One small step...'"
[08:48:17] <mdogg> Correct, and there should be a comma after Armstrong said
[08:48:27] <ghen> or a colon
[08:48:34] <ghen> either way is fine
[08:48:35] <mdogg> That would work.
[08:48:55] <ghen> but you can also quote something you would say, hypothetically
[08:49:26] <ghen> for example, if I wanted to quote you, I would say, "mdogg said, 'That would work.'"
[08:50:05] <ghen> Lol
[08:50:08] <ghen> anyway
[08:50:12] <mdogg> But that's where I don't get you.  If you're quoting me when would I ever say "mdogg said"?
[08:50:23] <ghen> you didn't
[08:50:30] <ghen> I'm quoting what I would say hypothetically
[08:50:35] <Me-me> We wouldn't. But we would say it if we were further quoting a text that was quoting you.
[08:51:15] <Me-me> "'But that's where I don't get you.' mdogg said." - Hypothetical Text of mdogg quotes
[08:51:50] <mdogg> No, that's not right.
[08:51:55] <Me-me> I'm afraid it is.
[08:52:03] <Me-me> You're taking a rule too literally and out of context.
[08:52:07] <mdogg> "But that's where I don't get you." modgg said.
[08:52:34] <mdogg> I'm sorry bro.  It just isn't.
[08:52:51] <Me-me> You are mistaken, sir.
[08:52:59] <ghen> Me-me, we are talking about hypotheticals now
[08:53:13] <ghen> quoting what you would say hypothetically
[08:53:36] <mdogg> "'We are talking about ypotheticals now.' ghen said."  That makes no sense written that way.
[08:54:00] <ghen> there should be a comma instead of a period, internally
[08:54:00] <Me-me> When we include a "[speaker] said" in quotes, it is not because we are quoting the speaker directly. We are quoting another text which is quoting them. The internal quote does not include the "[speaker] said" but that part is included in the outer quote, so it is within those outer quotation marks.
[08:54:13] <ghen> other than that it is technically correct despite you thinking it looks weird
[08:54:17] <Me-me> ^
[08:55:01] <mdogg> And all I'm saying that if you want to do that, just write something like "Below is the transcript:"  <begin transcript>
[08:55:11] <Me-me> Nobody's going to do that.
[08:55:21] <mdogg> Nobody wants to read "'But that's where I don't get you.' mdogg said."
[08:55:22] <Me-me> And it is not correct to do that.
[08:55:29] <Me-me> You are again incorrect.
[08:56:05] <ghen> You can probably do that too, mdogg
[08:56:29] <ghen> There are other ways of quoting statements.  That works the best for lengthy, or multi-paragraph quotes.
[08:57:17] <ghen> But for quoting short statements that contain internal quotes, you can use single quotes.
[08:57:36] <Me-me> It's true.
[08:58:52] <ghen> Something similar is internal parentheses in language.  If you want to parenthesize something inside of a statement that is in parentheses, you would substitute "[" and "]" for "(" and ")" internally.
[08:59:10] <Me-me> Or {} or even something more creative.
[08:59:27] <ghen> Those are technically for triple parentheses 
[08:59:32] <mdogg> That's different.
[08:59:42] <Me-me> ghen: Technically, sure.
[08:59:45] <mdogg> I thought to myhself 
[08:59:46] <ghen> that's true it is different, but it is similar imo
[08:59:50] <mdogg> Is not a phrase that needs to be quoted.
[09:00:05] <Me-me> It's not different. It's the same principle applied for the same reasons.
[09:00:09] <ghen> not if you're saying it mdogg
[09:00:34] <mdogg> Yes it is.
[09:00:35] <ghen> but if someone else is quoting you saying you thought something to yourself and what it was, they would put the whole thing in quotation marks of some type
[09:00:57] <Me-me> I think we've all said as much as we can say. Restating our points isn't going to change anyone's position.
[09:01:05] <Me-me> Can we just drop it now.
[09:01:09] <ghen> they could use the inline paragraph type of quotation
[09:01:14] <ghen> if they wanted
[09:01:20] <ghen> i'm down to drop it
[09:01:46] <ghen> hopefully you learned about how some people use internal quotations ;)

[09:03:39] <mdogg> She must be drunk, I thought to myself.
[09:04:05] <Me-me> And now we're back to the original question, and you end up agreeing with me :P hilarious.

[09:04:52] <ghen> or at least, now you know
[09:05:53] <ghen> remember to use a comma, and if you're talking about what you would say hypothetically, you would quote the whole thing
[09:06:24] <mdogg> "She must be drunk", I thought to myself.
[09:06:49] <Me-me> ghen: You missed this: <mdogg> She must be drunk, I thought to myself.
[09:07:17] *** Quits: gry (~quassel@botters/gry) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[09:07:20] <mdogg> You're rigth.  I should have quoted "She must be drunk" because that's what I was thinking.
[09:07:21] <twb> WOTD grouse — adj. good, great
[09:07:36] <Me-me> That's a word I haven't heard for a while.
[09:08:06] <ghen> "Bearer of the curse, I will be by your side, until hope finally withers", she said.
[09:08:21] <twb> mdogg: it is quite common to not use "" for thoughts
[09:08:27] <twb> mdogg: but often it is e.g. italicized instead
[09:08:56] <ghen> "Did I ever have a name", he wondered?
[09:09:04] <mdogg> ^
[09:09:05] <mdogg> Good
[09:09:15] <twb> it's not *wrong* to use "" for thoughts
[09:09:20] <twb> just less common than for speech
[09:09:24] <Me-me> It has the comma outside the quote and the question mark at the end.
[09:09:24] <twb> there is more variation in styles
[09:09:45] <mdogg> I would still put a question mark inside the quotes.
[09:09:48] <mdogg> For that.
[09:10:07] <mdogg> "Did I ever have a name?", he wondered.
[09:10:10] <ghen> but it's third person
[09:10:14] <ghen> that's the problem
[09:10:24] <mdogg> Still 3rd person.
[09:10:28] <ghen> exactly
[09:10:49] <ghen> second person has a different tone
[09:11:01] <ghen> and is potentially preferable in certain situations
[09:11:02] <mdogg> "Did he ever have a name?"
[09:11:16] <Me-me> twb: They've been going back and forth on the same points for around an hour-fourty.
[09:11:53] <ghen> it's actually been three points now me-me
[09:11:54] <twb> mehhhhhhhh
[09:12:05] <mdogg> Yeah.  3 points.  Get it right.
[09:12:07] <mdogg> =p
[09:12:19] <ghen> first was internal quotes, second was quoting something that one would say hypothetically, and now the third is 2nd person perspective in writing
[09:12:21] <Me-me> I didn't say how many points though.
[09:12:28] <mdogg> Well, you should have.  
[09:12:35] <ghen> ah that's true lol
[09:13:04] <mdogg> I'm gonna take a break for a while.
[09:13:16] <mdogg> Good talk guys.  I mean that.
[09:13:43] <mdogg> I learn quite a bit from discussions like this.  
[09:13:55] <Me-me> Not if you don't change your views you don't :P
[09:15:06] <ghen> meh
[09:15:35] <ghen> it's good to question things and not blindly believe what people say
[09:15:42] <mdogg> I still don't think I'm incorrect.  But I do know that I'll think about things differently when it comes to quotes.
[09:15:47] <Me-me> ghen: Sure.
[09:16:07] <ghen> it's just how some other people do it
[09:16:24] <ghen> there are other ways as well
[09:16:40] <mdogg> Electroshock therapy. 
[09:16:50] <ghen> lol
[09:17:20] <ghen> full on lobotomy?
[09:17:29] <Me-me> Neurectomy.
[09:17:30] <mdogg> Only for extreme cases.
[09:18:15] <ghen> neocortexomy?
[09:18:40] <Me-me> I believe the -ectomy suffix would override the -ex suffice and create neocortectomy.

[15:23:32] <pussipupu> Also there are generally native speakers around, but they're more likely to respond to the actual question(and don't necessarily know more than second language English speakers)
[15:28:05] <Me-me> This is true. I know a great many European English-speakers, especially from Germany or the Nordics, who are much better about it than a too-large portion of the native speaking population, who have become complacent and lazy in their command of the language.

[15:47:01] <Babar> how would one handle "A/An ([word starting with vowel]) [word starting with consonant]"?
[15:47:18] <Me-me> That's a tricky one. What words?
[15:47:23] <Me-me> Also, what's the context?
[15:47:36] <Babar> does context matter in this situation?
[15:47:42] <Babar> lets say....
[15:47:47] <Babar> A/An
[15:47:52] <Babar> (unusual)
[15:47:53] <Babar> nose
[15:47:55] <mdogg> "An" is generally used when the noun starts with or sounds like a vowel.  
[15:48:03] <Me-me> Sure. A different level of formality and communication.
[15:48:40] <Me-me> Like, in spoken words, you can't use a brackets. You can intone lower, to imitate an aside, but it's not the same as, "You may take this sentence with or without the contents of the brackets."
[15:49:01] <Me-me> In an academic document you wouldn't use the brackets at all.
[15:49:35] <Me-me> In a comment to a friend you might just use it as you said, "A/an (unusual)" or perhaps even "A(n unusual)"

[17:07:27] <mdogg> Just a thought...

[21:31:46] <fentanyl> In English, what's the term that describes a 'word' that describes a 'specific' term for a more 'general' and 'common' term?
