[00:23:04] <riv> it proves them all equivalent
[00:23:13] <cuppajoeman> Yes my question is how
[00:23:20] <riv> the first red boxes proves 1,2,3 are all equivalent
[00:23:26] <riv> the second red box proves 1,4 are equivalent
[00:23:40] <cuppajoeman> https://i.imgur.com/1wUcJEB.jpg

[00:23:46] <riv> yes
[00:23:59] <cuppajoeman> Ok, so it proves that 1 <=> 2 ?
[00:24:03] <cuppajoeman> How does it do that
[00:24:05] <riv> let's look at 1 <-> 2
[00:24:08] <cuppajoeman> I can see that 1 => 2
[00:24:09] <riv> we have directly proved 1 -> 2
[00:24:21] *** tusko is now known as gganbu
[00:24:23] <riv> but we also showed 2 -> 3, 3 -> 1, putting them together gives 2 -> 1
[00:24:50] <cuppajoeman> How do you prove that?
[00:24:55] *** Joins: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo)
[00:25:22] <cuppajoeman> If 2 is true, then 3 is true,  and if 3 is true then 1 is true
[00:25:23] <riv> it's an axiom of logic that  A -> B, B -> C implies A -> C
[00:25:43] <cuppajoeman> So if we assume 2 is true, we get hat 1 is true?
[00:26:13] <cuppajoeman> Ok, so I see that this proves that 1, 2, 3 are all equivalent
[00:26:37] <cuppajoeman> Ok, and we have that 1 , 4 are equivalent (as you said)
[00:26:46] <cuppajoeman> So then 1, 2, 3, 4, are equivalent
[00:26:52] <cuppajoeman> Is this the proof structure?
[00:26:56] <riv> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetical_syllogism

[03:07:15] <newpy> oh wait, it's a geometric series right
[03:08:26] <Z-module> it's  1/(1 - 1/n) = n/(n - 1)   as long as |1/n| < 1

[03:08:52] <mefistofeles> err
[03:10:59] <newpy> Z-module, I'm seeing a formula for p = f/(1+r)^i
[03:11:17] <Z-module> is there a series now?
[03:11:29] <newpy> Z-module, so \sum{i=1}^inf f/(n^i) = f/(n-1)
[03:11:37] <newpy> just realized it's starting at i=1
[03:11:40] <newpy> I remember that changes things
[03:11:42] <Z-module> yes
[03:12:25] <Z-module> in general, if |x| < 1, then  SUM_{i=1,2,...} x^i = x/(1 - x)
[03:12:26] <newpy> so it would be fn/(n-1) - f/(n^0) ?
[03:12:34] <Z-module> in your case, x is 1/n

[03:14:51] <newpy> but I thought a geometric series \sum ar^i = a/(1-r), why is there an r in the numerator?
[03:16:06] <newpy> I mean it gets me the right answer, but it seems to contradict the geometric sum formula
[03:16:43] <Z-module> remove any constant factor:   SUM_{i >= 0} ar^i =  a (SUM_{i >= 0} r^i ) = a (1/(1 - r))       assuming |r| < 1
[03:17:29] <newpy> right, so why isn't \sum r^i = 1/(1-r) ?
[03:17:36] <newpy> why is it r/(1-r) ?
[03:17:56] <newpy> oh it's including i=0
[03:17:57] <newpy> I see
[03:18:01] <Z-module> it's 1/(1 - r)  if the sum starts at i = 0.  It's  r/(1 - r)  if the sum starts at i = 1.
[03:18:47] <Z-module>   SUM_{i=1,2,...) r^i =  r (SUM_{i=0,1,...} r^i) = r (1/(1 - r)) = r/(1 - r)
[03:18:55] <Decker> So this is sort of the starting point of angular-* quantities... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_displacement  basically you need a way to describe any acceleration or velocity, so there's thie angular displacement.... But it's not actually viewed as the angular displacemnt, but the displacment of some point in a body...
[03:19:01] <newpy> couldn't you just say sum{i>0} = sum{i>=0) - r^0 ?
[03:19:19] <newpy> ie 1/(1-r) - 1?

[04:08:41] <damo22_> the unit disc in C to another disc, and i find a function f: C -> C that maps every point z to the other disc
[04:10:15] <Z-module> If the other disk does not contain 0, there are no such maps that are "linear" in the sense of linear algebra.
[04:10:39] <damo22_> interesting, my second disc contains zero
[04:11:05] <Z-module> is it centered at 0, and you're after a map that is some scaling composed with some rotation around 0 ?
[04:11:27] <damo22_> yes
[04:11:47] <damo22_> actually mine is not centred at 0
[04:11:52] <damo22_> the second one
[04:12:06] <damo22_> but it does contain 0
[04:12:54] <Z-module> possibly you just mean a map of the form  f(z) = a + bz   where a,b are complex constants with b nonzero.
[04:13:04] <damo22_> yes
[04:13:33] <Z-module> If so, it's just the one with  a = f(0),  b = f(1) - a

[06:15:47] <Atsuko> there are exactly 100 of each
[06:16:21] <somiaj> ahh okay, so you have 200 things, 100 of them are A, and 100 of them are B, and you want to count the number of ways you can order them?

[06:49:52] <qergle> then you first need to find out how many As they get: 101 ways
[06:50:11] <qergle> then where they go
[06:51:03] <qergle> so C(100,0) + C(100,1) + C(100,2) + ... + C(100,100) = 2^100
[06:52:14] <qergle> or you can short-circuit that and notice what specing noticed.
[06:52:48] <Atsuko> yes, Thank you very much :)
[06:53:26] <qergle> it's not a hard limit (you have enough As and Bs to give them all As or all Bs) so you can remove that limit from the problem.
[06:54:18] <qergle> phrase it as: how many strings of length 100 are there made up of As and Bs. which is the total amount of numbers you can represent with 100 bits.

[11:56:50] <nejimban> okay
[11:57:28] <rubiksdream> its clear how to integrate something like 1 / |z|^2 , by just changing to polars
[11:57:34] <nejimban> so intuitively, dx dy / (|z - z_1||z - z_2|) is 1/|z| when |z| is very large
[11:57:37] <rubiksdream> so I suspect there is a change of variables that makes our integrand something like this
[11:57:47] <nejimban> because you don't see z_1 and z_2 anymore
[11:57:47] <rubiksdream> 1 / |z|^2, yeah
[11:57:54] <nejimban> no there is the dx dy
[11:58:02] <nejimban> which gives you |z| in polar
[11:58:02] <rubiksdream> oh sure, yes
[11:58:08] <rubiksdream> 1/r dr dtheta
[11:58:15] <nejimban> so then you get log R + O(1)
[11:58:19] <rubiksdream> yes
[11:58:28] <rubiksdream> and the z_1,z_2 cause the - log|z_1-z_2| + error term
[11:58:36] <nejimban> yes
[11:58:41] <rubiksdream> so there is likely a substitution that lets you do this formally
[11:58:45] <rubiksdream> that im too dumb to see
[11:58:58] <nejimban> so this suggests to taylor-expand 1/|z-z_1||z-z_2| for |z| large

[11:59:14] <nejimban> and writing this with polar coordinates
[11:59:56] <nejimban> obviously you need to show that the integrated error term remains small
[12:02:06] <rubiksdream> so basically I need to show that (1 / |z|^2 - 1 / (|z-z_1||z-z_2|)) integrates to -log|z_1-z_2| + the error, by assuming |z| is large and taylor expanding the integrand

[12:04:18] <rubiksdream> it would change the ball too, but when R is large i dont think it would matter

[14:49:27] <rubiksdream> mnhrdt the standard proof involves first proving tonelli, and then proving fubini, the standard proof of tonelli involves first proving it for indicator functions (by first proving it for indicators on product sets, then extending to general measurable sets by means of a dynkin system argument), and then extending by linearity to prove it for simple functions, and then by monotone convergence for nonnegative functions
[14:50:08] <rubiksdream> monotone convergence is used at some point, but it is dishonest to say it 'all boils down to monotone convergence'

[17:19:25] <CloudEvil> That is not a small range, and cannot be usefully linearly approximated.
[17:19:38] <CloudEvil> (assuming that is in radians and not degrees)
[17:19:49] <quarterback> mnhrdt, I think globall or in a certain range. I think its not possible to make the function linear globally.
[17:20:31] <quarterback> CloudEvil, For t = pi/8 or pi/4, the sinusoidal curve is approximately a straight line.
[17:20:43] <quarterback> I mean for the original function y(t)
[17:20:53] <CloudEvil> yes, but not out to 2/3 pi
[17:21:07] <quarterback> I am trying to extract the curve where it is nearly straight and make that a equation for a straight line .
[17:21:32] <quarterback> CloudEvil, Yes, it only works for small range after which it deviates from y(t).
[17:21:33] <Z-module> yes,  lim_{t -> 0} 4 sin(2t) / (4*2t) = 1
[17:22:15] <mnhrdt> quarterback: globally it is 0, as CloudEvil says.  This is fairly intuitive: if you look at the sine function from very far away, it is just 0 + noise

[17:43:16] <CloudEvil> And your exact approximation would depend on why you're trying to get that approximation.
[17:43:37] <quarterback> CloudEvil, I assume that function y(t) is a signal like a EM wave or a AC signal. If it is EM wave a peak amplitude may be enough to switch on something

[17:44:57] <quarterback> CloudEvil, At the moment, nothing is specified so its the linear approximation as a line y=mx for small region near 0 may suffice.

[20:13:58] <int-e> In ZFC, the elements are sets too.
[20:14:12] <cuppajoeman> So if I have some set { x ,y , z} how can I represent it all as a set?
[20:14:35] <int-e> So it starts out seemingly limited...{} is a set, {{}} is a set, {{},{{}}} is a set, etc.
[20:15:20] <int-e> If x, y and z are sets then so is {x,y,z}.
[20:15:47] <cuppajoeman> Ok, so they define set explicitly

[20:16:19] <cuppajoeman> I meant how is {x, y, z} modelled in ZFC when x, y, z are just random objects

[20:23:55] <int-e> Or take a quotient again.

[20:34:56] <dTal> "In mathematics (differential geometry), a foliation is an equivalence relation on an n-manifold, the equivalence classes being connected, injectively immersed submanifolds, all of the same dimension p, modeled on the decomposition of the real coordinate space Rn into the cosets x + Rp of the standardly embedded subspace Rp.

[22:47:00] <qergle> that's the questio!?!?
[22:47:08] <cuppajoeman> there's like 4 in a row
[22:47:12] <cuppajoeman> i'll share
[22:47:18] <qergle> given a product of metric spaces show you have a metric that induces the product topology?

[22:48:07] <qergle> ah...
[22:48:17] <qergle> so you weren't posing the wrong question
[22:48:34] <cuppajoeman> So a metric space is hausdorff
[22:48:46] <cuppajoeman> how does this help us
[22:49:08] <somiaj> because let x != y, can you find two disjoint open sets that contain each point independently?
[22:49:38] <somiaj> basically just let r = d(x,y)/2, then the B(x,r) and B(y,r) are always disjoint and contain x and y respectivally
[22:49:45] <somiaj> if x!=y
[22:50:01] <cuppajoeman> ok geometrically I see that
[22:50:30] <cuppajoeman> So that's the proof that a metric space is hausdorff
[22:50:40] <somiaj> I was just pointing out this property is a bit more general than just metric spaces and is known has hausdorff
[22:50:43] <somiaj> yup
[22:51:38] <cuppajoeman> And I want to show that { {}, R^w} is not metrizable
[22:52:11] <somiaj> so show it is not possible to find two disjoint open sets that contain (0,0,...,0) and (1,1,..,1)
[22:52:44] <cuppajoeman> Can't we though? just take the d(x,y)/2 ?

[22:53:16] <somiaj> what are the only two open sets you have to play with in this case?
[22:53:58] <cuppajoeman> Hmm I forgot the sets need to be open
[22:54:41] <cuppajoeman> So the only open sets we have to play with Is R^w and R^w
[22:54:54] <cuppajoeman> And thats never disjoint
[22:55:12] <cuppajoeman> So we ended up showing that this topology is not hausdorff
[22:55:14] <cuppajoeman> ?
