[11:01:38] <jcroisant> FunkyCosmonaut: That page is very very old and out of date. Try this instead: http://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Debugging
[11:02:00] <FunkyCosmonaut> Is feathers even maintained?
[11:09:54] <jcroisant> I wouldn't say it gets a lot of attention, but it works
[11:23:02] <FunkyCosmonaut> Installing TCL/TK, any way of debugging through repl? Any cool tools? That ",tr" function from that link I posted is all I wanted lol
[11:25:04] <jcroisant> There is an extension called trace which might be helpful: http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/trace
[11:36:02] <FunkyCosmonaut> How do I use this? I'm new to scheme in general
[11:36:19] <FunkyCosmonaut> (import trace) and (module trace) don't do anything, I'm a monke

[15:34:16] <Bunny351> is here someone who has experience with using WINE for running Windows apps on Linux?
[15:35:43] <wasamasa> I've most recently extracted images from qutebrowser's cache using a windows program, does that count?
[15:37:48] <Bunny351> so one can run windows binaries directly under Linux, right?
[15:38:02] <wasamasa> they show up as .exe processes in htop, yes
[15:38:14] <wasamasa> it's quite wild
[15:38:41] <wasamasa> I remember something about WINE registering new magic numbers for +x to work
[15:38:42] <Bunny351> hm... I wonder whether wine is a usable option to build and debug windows code
[15:39:59] <wasamasa> Kooda uses it with mingw to build and test executables
[15:40:23] <wasamasa> winedbg is a thing, but I've never used it
[15:40:44] <Bunny351> sounds good. thanks, wasamasa
[15:41:20] <wasamasa> the most recent thing I've seen on the topic was a docker container to compile scheme programs to .exe files
[15:42:09] <sjamaan> wasamasa, mario-goulart: Thanks for the python link and the discussion regarding semicolons
[15:42:16] <mario-goulart> yw
[15:42:59] <sjamaan> I think I agree with you guys but at this point I don't think changing the separator chars to just an ampersand is a good idea; too subtle breakage
[15:43:27] <sjamaan> Also, florz is totally right: the HTML spec should never have changed backwards incompatibly
[15:43:32] <sjamaan> That was a really dick move
[15:43:36] <mario-goulart> #t
[15:44:12] <sjamaan> I just want to retire from the web stuff
[15:45:01] <s-liao> Why?
[15:45:31] <sjamaan> It is soul sucking
[15:45:50] <sjamaan> The w3c has absolutely no clue what they are doing
[15:46:59] <sjamaan> And Google seems to single-handedly decide the direction of the web
[15:49:13] <mario-goulart> Bunny351: a bit on the slightly crazy side, but there's also reactos and qemu.
[15:49:54] <Bunny351> for qemu I need a windows image, and I don't want to develop under windows (NO!)
[15:50:11] <Bunny351> what is reactos?
[15:50:19] <mario-goulart> I mean you could replace windows with reactos.
[15:50:33] <mario-goulart> Reactos is an open source windows clone.
[15:50:41] <Bunny351> ah, ok
[15:50:41] <wasamasa> reactos to windows is like linux to unix, lol
[15:50:41] <sjamaan> Is that any better? It's the same shitty interface
[15:51:07] <mario-goulart> It is able to run a bunch of windows programs.  Looks very impressive.
[15:51:07] <sjamaan> And AFAIK it's buggier
[15:51:07] <Bunny351> I won't develop in a windows env
[15:51:22] <sjamaan> Like going back to 1998
[15:51:34] <wasamasa> yeah, it pretty much looks like windows 98
[15:52:11] <mario-goulart> That sounds more like a feature in terms of UI. :-)
[15:52:27] <mario-goulart> (compared to the current options)
[15:52:36] <sjamaan> hm, you have a point there ;)
