[14:04:39] <jotham> am i the only person that thinks carbonflux must have earned a shitload
[14:04:47] <jotham> being a weird silicon valley
[14:04:58] <jotham> so he can be super odd
[14:05:01] <jotham> but is safe
[14:16:05] <MaNI> so what you're basically saying is he is american?
[14:16:41] <jotham> i dunno
[14:17:04] <jotham> we come from poor counties with lots of weirdos MaNI 
[14:17:12] <jotham> and you and i are lucky
[14:17:21] <jotham> we get tons of money to be nerds
[14:18:11] <jotham> but yeah i think the yanks are safe
[14:19:17] <jotham> how is your covid going
[14:19:40] <jotham> here in nz they want to kill the govt
[14:19:45] <jotham> cause of america
[14:19:54] <jotham> even though we'r basically fine
[14:19:59] <jotham> it's very stange
[14:21:49] <jotham> last thing i learned about south africa
[14:22:05] <jotham> was pistorious feels sad he shot his hot wife
[14:22:20] <jotham> which is very dumb
[14:23:00] <jotham> maybe don't shoot your hot wife
[14:23:19] <jotham> or do
[14:23:26] <jotham> relationships are bad
[14:24:05] <MaNI> probably just wants bail
[14:24:26] <jotham> how does that work in za
[14:24:27] <MaNI> here you get bailed for murder in like 3 weeks usually 
[14:24:58] <MaNI> depends on your skin colour and political connections mostly I guess
[14:25:17] <jotham> right
[14:25:27] <jotham> in nz it depends on skin and gangs
[14:25:31] <MaNI> oscar has the wrong skin colour so tough luck for him
[14:26:05] <MaNI> covid  is about the same as before, government still abusing state of disaster and constantly extending it for no reason
[14:26:22] <jotham> yeah that's the main thing here
[14:26:25] <MaNI> only 30% or something of population vaccinated, but really not that many people dying
[14:26:38] <jotham> govt using covidi a cover
[14:26:46] <jotham> i am struggling with it though
[14:26:48] <T`aZ> i see the proplem here, you are an extremist antivax, im reporting you
[14:26:56] <jotham> normally gov can't do anything
[14:27:00] <jotham> and we all moan
[14:27:05] <MaNI> I've had mine 
[14:27:10] <jotham> they are doing heaps under covid
[14:27:16] <jotham> i think maybe that's okay
[14:27:51] <T`aZ> ive been saying this since the beginning, i've lost my mental health, im still going down, and nobody gives a fucks or has the balls to say that this is not normal
[14:28:00] <jotham> what annoys me is
[14:28:00] <MaNI> well its only okay if you luck out and have the right people in power, just like a benevolent dictatorship can actually be the best form of government
[14:28:06] <T`aZ> just go all fucking die in a fire, you all asked for this misery
[14:28:12] <jotham> i'd never pick a politician
[14:28:17] <jotham> to do worko
[14:28:30] <jotham> and i've spent decades inside IT
[14:28:30] <MaNI> but generally speaking its super bad
[14:28:59] <MaNI> T`aZ, I think I've been saying it since before you, so don't include me in your misery curse please
[14:29:28] <jotham> also T`aZ it's not a useful position
[14:29:42] <jotham> but sure be mysanthropic
[14:29:49] <jotham> it just makes you sound like a kid
[14:29:57] <jotham> we have to live in this memss
[14:30:00] <jotham> mess*
[14:30:08] <jotham> it's not a joke
[14:30:17] <jotham> we literally live in this shitshow
[14:30:23] <jotham> and alll we can do is fix it
[14:30:42] <jotham> it's not useful being hostile
[14:31:06] <jotham> we're the people that have to make it right
[14:31:30] <jotham> do you want a good or a shit planet
[14:31:42] <jotham> we have to make it good
[14:31:49] <jotham> yes minister is real
[14:31:58] <jotham> very terrible news, i know
[14:32:21] <jotham> you're from belgium so you're largely safe
[14:32:31] <jotham> out here in the colonies is a bit more wild
[14:32:46] <MaNI> lets start by hanging everyone who was singing the flatten the curve rhetoric and proceed from there, can get the planet great in no time at all ;) 
[14:33:11] <jotham> my #1 argument has been with rich people
[14:33:21] <jotham> saying nz can't ever get covered
[14:33:28] <jotham> and they told me i'm dumb
[14:33:37] <jotham> meanwhile we can't get any vaccine
[14:33:39] <jotham> it's very shit
[14:34:04] <jotham> i assume za is the same
[14:34:16] <MaNI> should have played the race guilt card like us, we are drowning in vaccine but none of our citizens want it
[14:34:27] <jotham> haha
[14:34:35] <jotham> we can't do it
[14:34:43] <jotham> the maori are strong
[14:34:47] <jotham> everyone loves them
[14:34:55] <jotham> no racism to be had
[14:34:58] <jotham> the haka dominates
[14:35:00] <jotham> haha
[14:35:04] <jotham> it's very stupid
[14:35:06] <MaNI> we repeatedly pulled the whole "boohoo the rich europeans are commiting vaccine apartheid by using their own vaccines on themselves first" shit
[14:35:09] <T`aZ> we are drowning in vaccines, some regions have +90% vaccinated rate, and it's still shit, lockdowns and primal liberties being taken away, and people are asking for more
[14:35:14] <MaNI> disgusting, world should have told us to fuck off
[14:35:21] <MaNI> but predictably and as usual the europeans caved
[14:35:27] <MaNI> you guys really need to stop doing that
[14:35:50] <jotham> yeah T`aZ it's quite annoying for us poor countries
[14:35:53] <MaNI> its time to tell africa to fuck off when it comes to stuff like this
[14:35:55] <jotham> you guys have so much vaccine
[14:35:58] <jotham> not your fault
[14:36:01] <MaNI> please spread the word
[14:36:04] <jotham> totally politics
[14:36:13] <jotham> its quite fucking outrageous though
[14:36:51] <jotham> i'd say my prime minister
[14:36:57] <jotham> even though i didn't vote for her
[14:37:01] <T`aZ> you are missing my point, vaccine will only protects the weaks from dying, it wont help with the dictatorial state being imposed, not liberties being regained
[14:37:08] <jotham> is one of the most popular people on earth right now
[14:37:09] <T`aZ> nor*
[14:37:14] <jotham> and we can't even get vaccines
[14:37:28] <jotham> like what the fuck
[14:37:32] <T`aZ> that is, it will help 1 digit % of the population
[14:37:37] <jotham> you guys both know jacinda
[14:37:51] <T`aZ> the other issues will still be there, and wont go away
[14:38:43] <T`aZ> but yes i agree, it's a shame the rest of the world hasnt received enough vaccines
[14:39:33] <T`aZ> but once it does, it wont wolve anything anyway, unless for that small %age that would have died and did not
[14:40:07] <MaNI> yeah, the loss of freedoms is going to be a thing for probably the rest of our lives
[14:40:09] <jotham> T`aZ: so i disagree with you regularly but i've been super fascinated by your approach to the vaccine
[14:40:17] <jotham> and i'm not taking a side
[14:40:21] <T`aZ> enjoy your pre vaccine-available liberties while you can, because you wont ever regain that back
[14:40:24] <jotham> i think you've been smart about it
[14:40:33] <jotham> it's very weird coming from nz
[14:40:40] <jotham> cause we live in a different world
[14:40:47] <jotham> and i understand that
[14:41:10] <jotham> if that make sense
[14:41:11] <jotham> sorry
[14:41:15] <jotham> i know it's over dramatic
[14:41:49] <jotham> i feel like nz is put out as a freak on covid
[14:41:54] <jotham> for the record
[14:42:00] <jotham> we just tried to have no plague
[14:42:07] <jotham> and got abused for it
[14:42:11] <jotham> it's very dumb
[14:42:35] <jotham> but i still think we want to be part of the planet
[14:43:13] <jotham> knock knock
[14:43:18] <jotham> no plague
[14:43:23] <jotham> like why is that bad
[14:43:33] <T`aZ> im just against all restrictions, from the start, im not antivax or 5g idiot, that as never been my point. Life is worth living, this past 1.5year has *not* been worth living, and i dont see when it will become worth ever again
[14:43:57] <jotham> yeah i realised that early, you're not an antivaxxer
[14:44:06] <jotham> but you got thrown in with their shit
[14:44:10] <jotham> which sucks
[14:44:15] <MaNI> anti covid measures have certainly done more damage than covid would have this side
[14:44:23] <T`aZ> this shit is not over, it cant be over, and they know this from the start, it's impossible to erradicate this kind of virus, worldwide
[14:44:24] <MaNI> just like I predicted from the start
[14:44:38] <jotham> it's the most wild thing that has ever happened to us as humans
[14:44:40] <MaNI> NZ is maybe special or something, but I think most countries are like us in terms of that
[14:45:18] <jotham> i lived in indonesia, malaysia, and china
[14:45:24] <MaNI> and based on NZs reaction I'd certainly be pretty hesitant about ever living in NZ personally, I'd say both NZ and AUS moved quite far down my list of places I'm interested in for now 
[14:45:27] <jotham> i think we will see more of it
[14:46:13] <jotham> MaNI: can i explain it like this
[14:46:30] <jotham> MaNI: as new zelanders we're very aware we're super bad at rules
[14:46:40] <jotham> MaNI: so we over reach all the time
[14:46:51] <jotham> MaNI: we really are way shitter than australia
[14:47:04] <jotham> MaNI: we absolutely fail to do anything useful
[14:47:16] <jotham> i don't know how to explain this
[14:47:25] <jotham> nz is literally the end of the earth
[14:47:30] <jotham> and we behave like it is
[14:47:58] <jotham> i know it seems illogical based on what you saw
[14:48:02] <jotham> but it's not true
[14:48:17] <jotham> you've spent years talking to me
[14:48:29] <jotham> i fucking hate all of you
[14:48:36] <jotham> that's not an accident
[14:48:41] <jotham> that's structural
[14:49:24] <jotham> all i can say is
[14:49:32] <jotham> there is a reason south africans defect to nz
[14:49:40] <jotham> and it's because it's great
[14:50:23] <MaNI> sure, different things appeal to different people
[14:50:51] <jotham> naah
[14:50:58] <jotham> doesn't matter what you and i think
[14:51:06] <jotham> saffas move here
[14:52:08] <MaNI> well a subset of saffas
[14:52:58] <jotham> do you find it offensive
[14:53:08] <jotham> hee
[14:53:30] <MaNI> find what offensive? that people move to nz? not at all
[14:53:47] <jotham> naah calling you saffies
[14:54:27] <MaNI> we even call ourselves that, doesn't bother me
[14:57:27] <jotham> fair enough
[14:57:36] <jotham> i think nz is the same with kiwi

[19:45:48] <Renderwww> great stuff at work, they hired gazillion more developers which just means more stuff breaks
[20:49:25] <dukwon> i got a job offer from CERN today
[20:50:15] <dukwon> 2-3 year contract, 2.5x my current net salary, no teaching or supervision but also no research: only software development
[20:50:40] <dukwon> i have a flat full of furniture and a washing machine that i'd have to either get rid of or take with me
[20:50:56] <dukwon> or sub-let i suppose
[20:57:33] <Renderwww> eww, time limited contracts
[20:57:44] <Renderwww> that's what you get for being a science pleb
[21:06:47] <dukwon> yep
[21:08:00] <dukwon> i'm pretty sick of moving long-distance every year or two
[21:12:46] <dukwon> still, 8 kCHF/mo tax free

[21:54:55] <Renderwww> but do you also get CHF expenses?
[21:55:11] <Renderwww> like a kebab for 20€ or whatever it costs there
[21:56:21] <dukwon> life if i go to a conference? sure
[21:56:37] <Renderwww> I mean, do you have to switzerland
[21:57:07] <dukwon> i can live on the french side
[21:57:33] <dukwon> rent is expensive by non-paris standards, but tbh seems not too different to bonn
[21:58:00] <Renderwww> not sure if I would prefer the french side, even if it were cheaper
[21:58:11] <dukwon> yeah it's fairly rural
[21:58:15] <dukwon> i would need a car
[21:58:28] <dukwon> i did it for 18 months during my PhD
[21:58:50] <Faux> \o/
[21:59:06] <dukwon> if i can pay under 2 kCHF in rent i'd rather live somewhere near the tram line that goes to CERN
[22:01:12] <Faux> Somewhere with a pasture and some stables.
[22:01:36] <dukwon> according to numbeo.com, 8 kCHF in geneva is worth 4 kEUR in bonn, and i take home 2.6 kEUR
[22:02:09] <dukwon> so even living on the swiss side is a significant pay rise
[22:02:19] <dukwon> then i fuck off out of academia at the end of it
[22:05:00] <Faux> Apparently I moved to the middle of nowhere enough that numbeo doesn't think I live anywhere, which I guess is true.
[22:07:44] <dukwon> do you live in one of those depressing towns along the M4 between london and bristol?
[22:08:08] <Faux> No, we moved to the coast; Dover.
[22:09:08] <dukwon> do you regularly flick the v's across the channel?
[22:09:24] <dukwon> from the top of the white cliffs
[22:09:41] <Faux> No need, I can directly stick it to the French by sticking it in my wife.
[22:10:06] <Faux> And my daughter. Wait. Not like that.
