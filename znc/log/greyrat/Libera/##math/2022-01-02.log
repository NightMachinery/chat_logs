[00:44:08] <Guest1778> when we multiply two numbers like 28 and 25, why does the "carry" process work? Like, first we multiply 8 and 5 and then "carry the 4"...why does this work?
[00:45:41] <int-e> Guest1778: let's pick 6*7 instead: 6*7 = 42 = 40 + 2 = 4*10 + 2, so the 4 becomes part of the "next digit" (with 10 times larger weight than the current one)
[00:46:28] <int-e> This is the general idea for carries, even when adding numbers. 19+27, you look at 9+7 = 16 and split it into 10 and 6; the 10 becomes a carry for the next digit.
[00:46:38] *** Joins: causative_ (~halberd@user/causative)
[00:49:48] <Guest1778> woah
[00:51:20] <int-e> oh and subtraction too, though the splitting looks a bit weird: 33 - 7, 3-7 "splits" into -10 + 6, so you carry a -1, which is intuitively easier to grasp as a borrow

[00:57:59] <Guest1778> its kinda hard to explain with text
[00:59:08] <int-e> Guest1778: The next digit has 10 times larger weight than the current one. So we need to divide what we carry over by 10.

[01:00:21] <int-e> so if the 6*7 computation is for the hundreds digit (weight 10^2), we use the fact that that 40 * 10^2 = 4 * 10^3 when shifting to the thousands digit.

[01:27:37] <Guest1778> int-e what about when we need to compute: 46 * 27 ? First we compute 46*7, but can you explain what we do with the 2?
[01:27:37] <Guest1778> So 1) 6*7 = 42 = 4*10 + 2. So we "carry" over the 4 and place it above the "4" in "46". Then compute 4*7 and add 4..
[01:29:49] <int-e> Guest1778: it's hard to properly keep track of this without some algebra: 46*7 = (40 + 6)*7 = 40*7 + 6*7 = 40*7 + 40 + 2 = (4*7 + 4)*10 + 2
[01:30:52] <int-e> Guest1778: As usual the multiplication by 10 is accomplished by shifting one place to the left.

[02:12:43] <PlanckWalk> In general you can think of four different projections, not just two.
[02:12:54] <XCode> yes

[02:13:48] <greenbagels> RadSurfer: there's a wiki article for that I think

[02:53:56] <XCode> PlanckWalk: That is strange for instance I had a function f = x_1 + c and g = x_2 + c and $A_1$ and $A_2$ such that int ln|f| neq 0 and int ln|g| neq 0. I thought for instance $int_{A_1xA_2} ln|x_1x_2 + c| neq 0$ could be achieved from nontriviality of integral of f and g.

[10:17:25] <Jong> For training neural nets, why do people say "gradients" are being computed when "partial derivatives" are being compute. All the partial derivatives together form a single "gradient" (singular, not plural).
[10:18:20] <Decker> well - not really - it forms a group of gradients that's together a gradient - but that's not relly "A" gradient... it's made up of parts anyway
[10:19:11] <Decker> plus it's often multi-layer... and each layers' gradient isn't really part of the others'
[10:29:53] *** Quits: xx (~xx@user/xx) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[10:31:03] <PlanckWalk> Also there's a different gradient at every update
[10:31:48] <PlanckWalk> Or even different gradients at every update when you consider each layer to have a different gradient, which is common
[10:32:06] *** Joins: dude12312414 (~test@gateway/tor-sasl/dude12312414)
[10:32:45] <PlanckWalk> On top of that the topology of the net is not always trivial, so you may have different gradients in different segments
[10:33:23] <Guest1778> does the topology of the model matter?
[10:33:27] <PlanckWalk> When connectivity is dynamically updated, even the components of the gradients change.
[10:33:54] <PlanckWalk> Topology in the computer science sense, not really a mathematical sense
[10:34:22] <Guest1778> I don't really know anything about ML sorry
[10:34:44] <Decker> what might be a gradient for some input might have little to do with another in the next evaluation

[15:04:56] <neure> ah right I could make a ray from camera position to the light direction and intersect that with camera near/far planes

[15:06:20] <neure> that is how lights like sun are implemented, they only have directional because for all practical purposes at least here on planet earth no matter where you move, sun is always in the same direction and "infinitely" far
[15:06:32] <Decker> ya
[15:08:13] <Decker> neure but there's probably like a lense flare/corona type sprite, and that would still be a billboard :)
[15:08:33] <Decker> eh - maybe it's just a shader thing *shrug*

[15:10:51] <neure> This is not for pretending to show the light as visually it might be seen, but instead for showing in the editor user interface so user can select it. I may render a circle with lines or something, I haven't decided yet.
[15:11:20] <buster> neure, calculate a clip-space position as usual, as if the light source is a point somewhere on the ray through the camera in the direction of the light. its distance is immaterial. all these clip-space points project to the same window space point. (you obviously won't get a meaningful depth component this way.)

[15:21:28] <buster> any position on that ray is fine. take a + v, where a is the world-space position of the camera and v is the world-space direction of the light.

[15:28:50] <buster> it's not a "real" point in world space. its specialness comes from the fact that it depends on the camera position. if you were to render the scene twice with different cameras, you would have to recalculate that point's "world coordinates". that's what makes it different from an ordinary vertex coming from an object in the scene.

[15:48:47] <buster> hmm. the light direction is specified in view space rather than world space? in that case ignore my last message. but the method is the same. take the point p = a + v, where a is now the view-space position of the camera (presumably (0,0,0,1), but whatever it is) and v is the view-space direction of the light (x,y,z,0). now treat p as any other point in view space: apply projection, perspective division and viewport, 
[15:48:47] <buster> window space position. (again, you should discard the depth coordinate as it is meaningless).

[15:58:16] <buster> neure, can you see why all the points p = a + lambda * v (where lambda is nonzero) give the same window-space coordinates? depending on details of the projection and viewport, they all map to something like (x/z, y/z).

[19:39:29] <Z-module> only barely
[19:39:42] <dila> i was wondering about the dimension of the intersection of two linear "surfaces"
[19:40:21] <CoolerX> isekaijin: better at rejecting outliers
[19:40:25] <Z-module> Simple enough to show that the interection of any nonempty collection (even infinite) of subspaces of a vector space V is again a subspace. Just check the axioms.  But the union of two subspaces, where neither is contained in the other, is NEVER a subspace -- try proving that.
[19:40:41] <isekaijin> CoolerX: There is no kind of mean that rejects outliers.
[19:40:48] <isekaijin> CoolerX: To reject outliers, you just throw them away.
[19:40:49] <dila> i don't think i would be able to prove it

[19:41:15] <Z-module> The union of *three* subspaces, where none is contained in the union of the other two, can somtimes be a subspace but only in quite special circumstances. Not over any infinite field, for example.
[19:42:24] <dila> Z-module: where can i even learn about the definition of union of subspaces?
[19:42:32] <Z-module> it's not a concept, really
[19:42:37] <Z-module> if you just mean the set union
[19:42:45] <isekaijin> Consider F_4 = {0,1,a,1+a}, where a is a root of X^2 + X + 1 \in F_2[X]. Then F_4 is the union of the (F_2)-vector subspaces <1>, <a> and <1+a>.
[19:42:56] <Z-module> those unions are practically never a subspace. So why bother with them?

[19:44:32] <dila> i have a practical problem which is that i have a polynomial in F_n[X] which i know represents a linear transformation. i also have the kernel of the transformation. i want to factoize the polynomial without enumerating the points in the kernel.
[19:45:08] <Z-module> A linear map of what space to what space?
[19:45:38] <dila> say (F_p)^n to itself
[19:46:02] <isekaijin> Is this n in (F_p)^n related to the original n in F_n?
[19:46:06] <dila> yes
[19:46:20] <dila> it is the original n
[19:47:04] <dila> well, the polynomial in F_(p^n)[X] represents a linear map (F_p)^n -> (F_p)^n
[19:47:24] <isekaijin> You originally said F_n, not F_(p^n), though.
[19:47:31] <isekaijin> That's why I asked.
[19:47:33] <dila> yes, sorry
[19:49:04] <isekaijin> Okay, so, as an (F_p)-vector space, F_(p^n) is of course isomorphic to (F_p)^n.
[19:49:17] <dila> right
[19:50:03] <dila> so initially i was trying to construct a polynomial factor containing all the roots in the subspace spanned by two kernel vectors
[19:50:27] <dila> which i could get by brute force by multipling p^2 factors together
[19:51:56] <dila> i turned to linear algbera when i realised that the kernel vectors could be interpretted as lines, and the 2-dimensional space they span is a plane

[20:46:41] <Z-module> hi cadmio
[20:46:49] <Z-module> I can answer your question from earlier:
[20:48:01] <Z-module> If alpha has the form (1 2 ...), and beta is (3 4 5), then compute what   alpha^-1 beta alpha beta^-1      does to the symbol 1, starting at the right:  beta^-1 doesn't touch it;  alpha moves 1 to 2,  beta doesn't touch 1 or 2, and finally alpha^-1 moves the 2 back to 1. So 1 is fixed.

[20:57:48] <Z-module> The easiest proof is that all subgroups of solvable groups are solvable, but for n >= 5, A_n is a non-solvable subgroup of S_n.
[20:59:22] <Z-module> a possibly more direct way is that if G is a group and N a normal subgroup, then G/N is abelian iff N contains the commutator subgroup G', and (S_n)' = A_n
[21:00:20] <cadmio> my text gives this justification: if it were solvable (for n >= 5) then A_n would be solvable and simple hence A_n would be cyclic of prime order, which cannot be for n >= 5

[23:13:48] <Guest145> johnkeats6 yeah but the a^x fuck things up
[23:14:32] <Guest145> is hard to get an odd or even function in the form of a^x*f(x)
[23:14:32] <mefistofeles> Guest145: it's annoying, you have to expand the product and then apply parts twice... for each of the resulting integrants

[23:15:35] <Guest145> Yeah

[23:18:56] <MarkT-> I am trying to identify what is wrong with a proof... Consider the sets a_k={n ∈ ℕ | n≥k}, so a_1={1,2,3,4...}, a_2={2,3,4,5...}, etc.  a_1 is not empty. (a_1=ℕ)  if the set a_1 ∩ a_2 ∩ ... ∩ a_n for a finite n is not empty, then a_1 ∩ a_2 ∩ ... ∩ a_n ∩ a_n+1 is not empty for all n.   This would seemingly imply that a_1 ∩ a_2 ∩ a_3 ∩ ... is not empty, becase can clearly see that
[23:19:02] <MarkT-> a_1 ∩ a_2 ∩ a_3 ∩... ⊆ ℕ. from here, for all n ∈ ℕ, n ∉ a_1 ∩ a_2 ∩ a_3 ∩ ..., because n ∉ a_(n+1), which clearly shows that a_1 ∩ a_2 ∩ a_3 ∩ ... = ∅, contradicting what induction would tell us if it applied in the infinite case.
