[02:14:37] <ardon> Hi, does anyone else get almost nonexistent input fields on Nyxt's internal pages? I'm trying to play around macros via edit-macro but the input field is soo small
[02:21:11] <waleee> ardon: it's becuse internal buffers have zero styling predefined, https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/master/source/buffer.lisp#L525
[02:23:22] <waleee> ardon: which internal page are you experimenting with?
[02:25:28] <ardon> Hmm, thanks, but shouldn't it default to a normal unstyled text field then ? I'm not sure how I'm I supposed to style to make it usable, perhaps adding padding?
[02:25:40] <waleee> * slight addendum to the "zero styling", they might not have styling for input fields
[02:26:34] <ardon> walee: The edit-macro page
[02:30:19] <waleee> yeah, that one is basically straight unstyled html rendered by spinneret
[02:30:21] <waleee> https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/master/source/mode/macro-edit.lisp
[02:32:32] <waleee> * formatted by sou
[02:32:44] <waleee> ** s/rendered/formatted/
[02:43:59] <waleee> ardon: is it the input field in lisp-repl also very small?
[03:13:02] <ardon> waleee: Nope, it looks fine, it looks like it's applied some padding too. However, by the look of things trying to type in it doesn't produce any output in the screen.
[03:16:38] <waleee> the input field on it isn't autofocused so you need to select it with hints or the mouse
[03:28:29] <waleee> ardon: which nyxt commit are you using?
[03:28:35] *** Quits: ebrasca (~user@librepanther.com) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:29:44] <waleee> a lot were added to edit-macro recently so you might have checked out one in the middle of the commit spree
[03:30:52] <ardon> walee: So it seems the input field on lisp-repl is indeed getting focused, I just didn't get any feedback from it while typing, but on enter the expressions are sent through
[03:30:59] <ardon> I'm on b937c3d6c59c9ce4c09fceae903e2cc3a7e62a53
[03:32:30] <waleee> ok that shouldn't be the issue from the looks of it
[03:32:49] <waleee> are you building using the makefile or quicklisp?
[03:34:54] <ardon> Using the Makefile via guix shell
[03:36:37] <waleee> I assume you're using guix as the os and not just as an additional package manager?
[03:37:01] <ardon> Yup, as the OS
[03:38:44] <waleee> you could try build it via https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/master/build-scripts/nyxt.scm#L9
