[02:06:42] <re101-deer-85> i dont know what are latin and arabic characters
[02:07:10] <re101-deer-85> like i can add or remove those characters later depending on my requirement
[02:07:47] <JohnDoe1> well basically they are letters with different shapes than what we use right now, used around the globe. https://regex101.com/r/R2ofCI/1
[02:09:00] <JohnDoe1> brahmic stuff looks very interesting if you like that sort of stuff but anyway, good luck
[02:11:28] <JohnDoe1> if you want a specific length by the way you can replace the * before $ with {min,max} so {8,20} would be between 8 and 20 characters

[14:50:28] <re101-walrus-20> Guys, can you help me with generating regex for finding duplicated digits (that aren't adjacent too). In case of  137370 it should match 3 and 7, in case of 110000: 1 and 0.
[14:51:36] <Me-me> Are they just inside strings of digits?
[14:52:12] <re101-walrus-20> It's just a 6 symbol digits (from 100000 to 999999)
[14:52:15] <digitok> (\d)\1*(?=.*\1)
[14:52:21] <Me-me> Um.
[14:52:36] <digitok> re101-walrus-20 ^
[14:52:37] <Me-me> (\d)(?=\d{0,4}\1)
[14:52:49] <Me-me> Why would you put \1* in there?
[14:52:58] <digitok> why would you not
[14:53:08] <Me-me> Becaaause you only need one?
[14:53:23] <digitok> idea: test yours
[14:53:45] <Me-me> Seems to work fine.
[14:53:50] <digitok> link
[14:53:56] <Me-me> https://regex101.com/r/ueUAIw/1
[14:54:07] <digitok> now test the second example
[14:54:22] <Me-me> Pfff
[14:54:28] <Me-me> The same could be said of 101010
[14:54:40] <Me-me> Yours would also match repeats in that case.
[14:54:58] <digitok> good point. this is called refining
[14:55:11] <Me-me> And it's something I was trying to do when you jumped in with the .* version.
[14:55:25] <digitok> sorry, i did not notice
[14:55:42] <re101-walrus-20> if I use example above, in case of 110000 it show me not only 1 and 0, but 1, 0, 0, 0
[14:56:00] <Me-me> Right.
[14:56:17] <digitok> where are you using this, re101-walrus-20
[14:56:20] <digitok> which language/tool
[14:57:20] <re101-walrus-20> Sorry, ofc I should clarify - python3
[14:57:40] <Me-me> https://regex101.com/r/ueUAIw/2
[14:57:45] <re101-walrus-20> using re.findall method
[14:58:28] <Me-me> r"(\d)(?=\d{0,4}\1)(?!\d{0,3}\1\d{0,3}\1)" should do it.
[14:59:17] <digitok> or r"(\d)(?=.*\1)(?!.*\1.*\1)"
[14:59:33] <Me-me> Why are you using .*, we have the exact kind of character we're interacting with!
[14:59:45] <digitok> because it is simpler
[14:59:48] <Me-me> For that matter we also have the length.
[15:00:07] <digitok> exactly. we do not need to validate anything
[15:00:12] <Me-me> It's simpler at the expense of massive inefficiency.
[15:00:19] <Me-me> In the case of failure.
[15:00:43] <digitok> massive?
[15:00:45] <digitok> please share
[15:01:20] <Me-me> If the collective works of shakespeare are processed by accident, my pattern will have at most 36 steps per failure, and yours would have n^3 steps.
[15:02:00] <digitok> good chat, me-me. 10/10. would chat again
[15:02:01] <Me-me> Because .* is terrible.

[15:06:09] <re101-walrus-20> oh, sorry, one clarification - I misunderstood the success condition. Regex should check not single digit but should find alternating repetitive digits pairs. In case of 137370 it should be False and in case of 101201 should be Ok
[15:06:39] <re101-walrus-20> And, thanks for help, regex gurus - you help me with my headache a lot!
[15:07:01] <Me-me> So to be clear, what should match in 101201?
[15:08:17] <purplex> i also tested, digitok's regex seems to give unique matches, but Me-Me can produce duplicates
[15:09:08] <Me-me> walrus: Because 137370 seems to have alternating repetitive digit pairs.
[15:10:36] <Me-me> Unless that's what you mean, that 137370 should match and 101201 shouldn't.
[15:11:02] <re101-walrus-20> 101201 should match only 1 as I understood
[15:11:33] <Me-me> Why should that match?
[15:12:15] <re101-walrus-20> This is an examples for that task:
[15:12:16] <re101-walrus-20> 121426 # Here, 1 is an alternating repetitive digit.
[15:12:16] <re101-walrus-20> 523563 # Here, NO digit is an alternating repetitive digit.
[15:12:17] <re101-walrus-20> 552523 # Here, both 2 and 5 are alternating repetitive digits.

[15:13:50] <purplex> i see his point
[15:14:21] <Me-me> I'm afraid that if 137370 shouldn't match, then I don't see what the question means by alternative repetitive digits.
[15:14:37] <purplex> i think he wants to consider a duplicate when there's a digit in middle of two same digits
[15:15:06] <re101-walrus-20> yeah, correct
[15:15:26] <purplex> 525 and 252 means 5 and 2

[15:16:22] <digitok> what about 123334

[17:04:48] <purplex> hm now you're saying "Plot ##5 should be a match" but earlier you said "Plot ##5 is not okay"
[17:05:00] <re101-deer-85> yes
[17:05:18] <re101-deer-85> not okay means it should be a match
[17:05:40] <purplex> oh ok
[17:06:14] <purplex> try https://regex101.com/r/5TFZBh/4
[17:06:16] <re101-deer-85> we are restricting or matching two consecutive special character and eliminating them
[17:06:47] <purplex> so @abc is not ok too
[17:09:14] <re101-deer-85> !@#$%^&*()_+-={}[]|\:";'<>?,./`~
[17:09:15] <re101-deer-85> these are special characters
[17:09:15] <re101-deer-85> they should not come side by side or adjacent to each other
[17:09:58] <re101-deer-85> in the match there should be words with two consecutive special characters
[17:11:05] <purplex> oh, earlier you said !@#$%^&*() .. lets see, can you paste and replace them?
[17:13:06] <purplex> [!@#$%^&\*()_\+\-={}[\]|\:";'<>\?,\.\/`~] escaped
[17:13:49] <re101-deer-85> sorry
[17:14:10] <purplex> https://regex101.com/r/5TFZBh/5
[17:15:57] <purplex> if this doesn't work then 1.) salesforce might be using a different regex "flavor", or 2.) i misunderstood
[17:15:59] <re101-deer-85> null/empty line is also a match
[17:17:26] <purplex> you can add (?!$) after ^
[17:17:56] <purplex> https://regex101.com/r/5TFZBh/6 brb
[17:22:35] <purplex> when you said "is a also a match" i read it as "i don't want them to match"
[17:22:44] <re101-deer-85> @abc shouldnot match because only single @ present
[17:23:42] <re101-deer-85> Actually when a customer enters his address
[17:23:43] <re101-deer-85> he should not use two special characters consecutively
[17:24:27] <re101-deer-85> im confused match means not allowed
[17:24:27] <re101-deer-85> not a match means it should be allowed
[17:27:23] <purplex> im confused too, but @a and @2 can be a match
[17:27:54] <purplex> but @ab cannot be?
[17:29:20] <re101-deer-85> only @@    @#    @%   @*etc should be a match
[17:29:46] <re101-deer-85> #@     #$    !@   also should be a match
[17:29:56] <purplex> because earlier i heard @2 should be a match
[17:30:32] <purplex> ok so its only consecutives..
[17:30:34] <re101-deer-85> any special character along with more than one character should be amatch
[17:30:42] <re101-deer-85> yeah yes consecutives
[17:31:15] <re101-deer-85> *&   ^%   #$    *@     !@     &^    **    %%     ^^
[17:31:52] <re101-deer-85> two ore more than two
[17:31:52] <re101-deer-85> *&%    ^&^     *&*     #$@    *(*
[17:32:02] <re101-deer-85> should be match
[17:32:20] <purplex> in @2 also a single @ is present. it is a match, but in @abc it shouldn't be a match?
[17:32:47] <re101-deer-85> @2 and @abc both should not be match
[17:33:16] <re101-deer-85> because only single @ present in them
[17:36:02] <purplex> should @ only be present in a word or any word of line? e.g. @abc def@ 
[17:36:21] <re101-deer-85> any word of line
[17:37:10] <re101-deer-85> if its single in any word then its not a match
[17:37:11] <re101-deer-85> if its consecutive in any word of line that would be a match
[17:42:10] <purplex> im not sure https://regex101.com/r/5TFZBh/7 can you test?
[17:44:17] <purplex> maybe you can add some test cases in box so i can test 
[17:48:49] <re101-deer-85> https://regex101.com/r/UJvg6q/1

[19:06:31] <re101-spitz-22> Hi. Why does this regex \W|\(.+\) not match everything everything in parentheses (including the parentheses) in this string eo--fk (fefeftt). I want it to watch any non-word character plus anything inside parentheses

[19:07:41] <re101-spitz-22> here it should match "--" as well as "(fefeftt)"
[19:08:20] <re101-spitz-22> "--" as well as " (fefeftt)"
[19:08:28] <re101-spitz-22> ^ correction
[19:09:00] <re101-spitz-22> js flavor
[19:09:28] <re101-spitz-22> if I reverse it, \(.+\)|\W, it does work
[19:11:32] <purplex> because \W is matching ( and )
[19:11:59] <re101-spitz-22> ahh, so simple, gotcha
[19:12:35] <purplex> yes put it after |
[19:12:40] <re101-spitz-22> although the reverse works, is there a more efficient version?
[19:15:34] <purplex> depends.what if you have nested ( ) inside e.g. (fe(fe)ftt)
[19:16:20] <re101-spitz-22> only the outermost parentheses matter
[19:17:13] <purplex> in that case \(.+\) is ok, if there won't be any ( ) inside (fefeftt) then you can optimize
[19:18:00] <re101-spitz-22> there won't be
[19:18:39] <purplex> then do \([^)]+\)
[19:21:17] <re101-spitz-22> that one doesn't work
[19:22:05] <re101-spitz-22> ty, I'm ok with the other one
