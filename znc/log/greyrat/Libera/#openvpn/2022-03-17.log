[21:04:22] <havoc> welcome back
[21:04:31] <krzee> thank you! :)
[21:45:10] <Xanthaos> Yep I was right. and whoever messed with my system completely trashed openvpn. I'd not be surprised if there's a blank instance running somewhere
[21:46:39] <Xanthaos> I have made literally no changes to my openvpn at all since I installed it, and it's been running fine. All of a sudden today it refuses to startup, stating a problem with the pid file in systemctl status and in the log file.
[21:48:29] <Xanthaos> I have looked at the service file, and it did reference non-existent directory (/var/run/openvpn) so I changed it back to /var/run/openvpn-server, which is something I had to do when I first installed. I ran systemctl daemon-reload, and it's still failing. <cont>
[21:48:58] <Xanthaos> Now it's actually writing the pid file to the directory, but it still says it's not writing the pid file. This is wierd.
[21:50:44] <Xanthaos> Would someone mind helping me with this one? Let me know what configs/logs/files you'd like me to post/

[22:19:14] <Xanthaos> I'm trying to find out.
[22:19:27] <Xanthaos> I thought I had it fairly secure
[22:19:54] <Xanthaos> I may have to burn the whole box. Wife is going to divorce me. No shit.

[22:21:46] <Xanthaos> And that just today
[22:24:56] <krzee> why would your wife trip if you reinstalled a server?
[22:28:28] <Xanthaos> Not as long as i preserved her data (we're talking pics of the kids,one of which was murdered a few years ago, other stuff that's completely irreplaceable). Even my damn backups are compromised, as I had the backup drive connected at the time that these entries are showing up. So yeah, if I've been compromised, every bit, every sector becomes suspect.
[22:29:10] <Xanthaos> I am tearing through logs now see if I can somehow rule out an unauthorized entry.
[22:36:00] <Xanthaos> maybe if someone has a suggestion to help rule out an attack? I'm seeing wierdo stuff. I'm seeing external traffic coming in on my udp openvpn port (I don't use tcp) for which I can't find anything in the openvpn logs to substantiate this, and I'm seeing external traffic coming in on my ssh port (it's on a nonstandard port also) but I don't see any entry in /var/log/secure or /var/log/fail2ban.log 
[22:36:00] <Xanthaos> to indicate they even attempted access. No failed attempts. I use multifactor auth here, starting with key auth
[22:36:33] <Xanthaos> but the fact that my openvpn was acting wierd makes everything suspect.
