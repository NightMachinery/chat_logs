[00:00:11] <nomagno> Doesn't ring a bell
[00:00:41] <nomagno> You mean event driven architecture?
[00:00:49] <ProfSimm> nomagno: well there's a domain. Say a database. Any time something happens in that database, like row changed, deleted, inserted, we emit an event for it. This produces a stream of events: data stream.
[00:01:16] <ProfSimm> nomagno: multiple machines can read that same stream of events and produce different models out of it. Different aspects.
[00:01:32] <nomagno> Yes
[00:01:36] <ProfSimm> nomagno: this is an example of MISD. You have one data stream, but multiple independent operations read it and make something out of it
[00:01:46] <ProfSimm> They don't chop it in pieces
[00:01:50] <ProfSimm> They all see all of it
[00:01:51] <nomagno> So, you could have some code/execution stream that computes the average, and another that computes the median?

[00:02:48] <ProfSimm> nomagno: MIMD I guess would be just a graph of operations with no restriction at all. Technically CPUs are MIMD internally.
[00:03:16] <ProfSimm> nomagno: hence why they can process multiple instructions at once in paralle in otherwise serial code
[00:03:31] <nomagno> Hm, makes sense
[00:03:36] <epony> not all of them ;-) at any single point in time
[00:03:51] <ProfSimm> Well they have to maintain the semantics of linear execution

[01:11:58] <phogg> pyzozord: try implementing a shell without doing it that way. The parent opens the fd for the pipe between A and B and spawns A with stdout connected to it and B with stdin connected to it.

[01:28:53] <bjs> pyzozord: well EOF isn't a real character,  Linux (as an example) provides a "read" syscall and presumably it has a boolean flag that knows if the stream is still alive or not

[01:56:39] <pulse> :p
[01:56:51] <pyzozord> vim is a different beast
[01:57:02] <pyzozord> I'm not a big fan of vim to be honest
[01:57:11] <pyzozord> it's way too complex
[01:57:26] <nomagno> nvi is lighter? I just want a light vi to learn basics of portable-ish vi
[01:57:37] <pulse> actually the reasonably useful subset is rather narrow
[01:57:39] <pyzozord> nvi is the bsd's vi
[01:57:50] <pyzozord> yes it's much lighter than vim
[01:57:53] <pulse> vimtutor teaches you all the basics
[01:57:57] <pulse> idk about emacs, never used it
[01:57:58] <nomagno> Oh, I didn't know it was called that
[01:58:38] <nomagno> BSD software naming conventions are confusing
[01:58:48] <nomagno> Sometimes it's bfoo, sometimes nfoo
[01:58:57] <nomagno> Then you have nmake, which is microsoft
[01:59:01] <pyzozord> nvi is the best version of vi in my opinion, it's really good old vi with fixed bugs and tiny bit better support for wide chars and multiple undo steps, things like that
[01:59:06] <nomagno> Which confused me even more
[01:59:18] <nomagno> With gnu its always gfoo
[01:59:31] <pyzozord> it has vertical and horizontal windo splits withch I find useful
[01:59:35] <duuude> netbsd vi didn't have backspace by default
[01:59:48] <duuude> I did ESC-x all the time
[02:00:46] <duuude> stuff like vim are super light for this tie. aiming for more simplicity than that is not going to reward one much
[02:00:52] <duuude> time*
[02:01:13] <pyzozord> i often just ctrl-w when I'm in the insert mode, it's really faster to write the word again than to move to the right leter delete write new one, move back to the end of the word
[02:01:56] <pyzozord> but it appears nvi actually supports backspace in insert mode, but only until the place where you entered insert mode
[02:01:59] <duuude> TIL about ctrl-w, nice.
[02:02:03] <pyzozord> cant backspace stuff you haven't entered
[02:02:12] <pyzozord> that's how it should be, insert mode is for inserting

He wants to know how you'd order these fruits, so he wants to tell you the three fruits, but without biasing you by saying them to you in some order. You can ask questions like "do you have a fruit that's yellow" or "tennis ball sized" and John can answer yes, or no.
[02:49:25] <ProfSimm> Or when exactly one fruit matches, he can give you the name of the fruit, so the producer can provide three answers:  "0 items match your description"  or "more than 1 items match your description"  or "exactly 1 item matches: pear". This would not reveal John's internal order for these fruits. So... how to make this conversation efficient so all fruits are quickly discovered?

[09:40:36] <Jong> Hello
[09:43:59] <ent58> Hi :)
[09:44:09] <Jong> So I'm trying to debug something that takes about 30 minutes to run.   I have a configuration that isn't getting the right result.  I modified it in several ways to another configuration that does get the right result.  My plan is make one change at a time and run to find the point at which I stop getting the right result. That'll mean I've narrowed down where the problem is, or at least have a better indication.   Is this a good plan?
[09:44:42] <rindolf> Jong: use logging

[09:45:48] <rindolf> Jong: and 30 minutes is atrocious

[09:46:33] <ent58> or just a really slow machine :P

[12:05:24] <rindolf> dan01[m]: hi. what's new?\
[12:05:34] <Jong> sorry, I'll stop ranting
[12:06:01] <pyzozord> as far as I know they aren't related
[12:06:25] <pyzozord> except logarithms were previously printed out instructions and tables in a book that you would follow to calculate something

[12:08:43] <pyzozord> Jong: let me know once you find out

[15:24:57] <Kingsy> question, I have a repo that requires some commands to be executed in order to make sure the repo is functional. But I want to make sure the repo is as cross platform as possible. Is there a native tool I can use across Windows / Linux / Mac which I can use to programmatically determine the client is able to use the repo and if not make the necessary changes to enforce this.

[15:30:04] <amigojapan> Kingsy: I would provide a binary installer for each platform made for it,s ince that is what the people are expecting,,, but once you get python installed, you can share the same code base with your other scripts

[15:31:06] <pyzozord> but it will only tell you that it's broken, you'll need to fix it manually
[15:31:50] <pyzozord> you can use docker or a vm to simulate different environments for testing
[15:31:55] <Kingsy> well this is more of a local dev repo. so it'll contain a script for installing minikube, the setup for that. extra commands. provisioning etc. so not somethingf thats "deployed"
[15:32:22] <amigojapan> I see
[15:32:42] <pyzozord> it doesn't matter, if you want to test if your minikube installation script works you need to test it

[17:00:15] <amigojapan> lol duuude
[17:00:35] <duuude>  Take for example Apple Computers, makers of the popular Macintosh line of computers. The real operating system hiding under the newest version of the Macintosh operating system (MacOS X) is called... Darwin! That's right, new Macs are based on Darwinism! While they currently don't advertise this fact to consumers, it is well known among the computer elite, who are mostly Atheists and Pagans.
[17:00:39] <amigojapan> mrig: just dont mind them then
[17:01:01] <amigojapan> mrig: what someone believes does not change what you are
[17:01:05] <mrig> Oh but I love category theory, especially when applied :)
[17:02:00] <duuude> Apparently the Darwin OS is not the original creation of Apple Computers but is instead based off of an older, obsolete OS called "BSD Unix". The child-indoctrinatingly-cute cartoon mascot of this OS is a devil holding a pitchfork (pictured right). This OS -- and its Darwin offspring -- extensively use what are called "daemons" (which is how Pagans write "demon" -- they are notoriously poor spellers: magick, vampyre, etc.) which is a program that hides in 
[17:02:02] <duuude> the background, doing things without the user's notice. If you are using a new Macintosh running OS X then you probably have these "daemons" on your computer, hardly something a good Christian would want!

[17:43:08] <amigojapan> yup nomagno
[17:43:26] <nomagno> Negro the pejorative term for black people in English comes from the Spanish word for 'black'
[17:43:36] <koollman> I would prefer the word being used, and the concept being clearly defined to enforce contrast. it is fine and normal to have software or hardware without self-determination and enslaved to some other system. It is very wrong to have humans in the same situation. If anything, it should go the other way, so that humans verify they aren't being treated as hardware or software
[17:43:47] <amigojapan> hmm probably not
[17:43:53] <koollman> but, well, I don't quite have a say in that, so ... I'll get used to it

[23:37:56] <bjs> pyzozord: for example in Python, if there's a function/method that isn't documented and you call it, you can be sure that before you call it you know what state you were in.
[23:38:41] *** Quits: dunkeln (~dunkeln@user/dunkeln) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[23:38:51] <bjs> To know what state you end in afterwards you might have to go read the code, or know something about the implementation, or something like that.
[23:39:06] <pyzozord> so in c all things that aren't mentioned in the spec are implictly unspecfied and implementation defined?
[23:39:21] <bjs> pyzozord: no in C they are implicit undefined behaviour (UB)
[23:39:23] <pyzozord> but things that are mentioned and explictly said to be undefined are called undefined behaviour

[23:40:23] <nomagno> pyzozord: Things that aren't mentioned are UB. Things that are called undefined are UB. Things that are called implementation-defined are implementation-defined.
[23:40:34] <nomagno> Implementations MAY act consistently when they face UB
[23:40:57] <nomagno> This is known as "specifying behaviour". So it is, in a way, implementation defined, but it is allowed to be an ignored feature
[23:41:05] <nomagno> For all the compilers cares
[23:41:34] <bjs> pyzozord: a C program with UB the compiler can (and for fun examples, does!) arbitrarily transform into an entirely different program.
[23:41:36] <nomagno> This is why GCC may do things such as allow inline assembly, or integer overflow
[23:42:00] <nomagno> Programs with UB need not technically run ^
[23:42:12] <nomagno> But many compilers do act consistently when they face UB
[23:42:30] <nomagno> This consistent behaviour is sometimes crashing. Other times, working as expected
[23:42:54] <nomagno> Others may compile different instances of possible similar/identical UB to different programs
[23:42:59] <nomagno> Depending on the context
[23:43:11] <pyzozord> I know all these things

[23:44:34] <nomagno> pyzozord: So, the purpose of UB is to allow the compiler/implementations freedom with tackling problems. Part of it is performance improvement, part of it is lack of a clear default behaviour, part of it is oversight, part of it is less work for everyone involved
[23:44:37] <pyzozord> maybe if we called it strawberries and agreed that only c spec has the concept of strawberries

[23:45:57] <pyzozord> how come python doesn't have, python just says "whatever happens in cpython is what should happen"?
[23:46:14] <pyzozord> and how does js handle ub
[23:46:31] <nomagno> pyzozord: 'Implementation defined behaviour', such as signed integer representation, in C means "Needs to work properly(!!!), and consistently(!!!) Within an implementation"
[23:46:50] <nomagno> pyzozord: Python indeed relies on the compiler CPython was compiled with for low-level behaviour
[23:46:54] <nomagno> JS has no UB.
[23:47:16] <nomagno> JS implementations, such as V8, need to watch out and try to be as consistent as possible

[23:47:25] <pyzozord> what is the difference between implementation defined and undefined behaviour
[23:47:29] <bjs> pyzozord: so C has two different ideas: UB (undefined behaviour) and IB (implementation defined behaviour)
[23:47:40] <bjs> pyzozord: IB means if you do it, the implementation decides what happens when you do that thing
[23:47:47] <bjs> pyzozord: UB means you can't do it, and if you do it, the entire program can do anything
[23:47:59] <nomagno> pyzozord: I just explained it, scroll up
[23:48:14] <nomagno> UB anything can happen. Compilers may treat it consistently or inconsistently
[23:48:15] <deniska> pyzozord: sizeof(int) is implementation defined behavior
[23:48:19] <oldlaptop> IB means the the implementation must decide what it's doing, and *document that choice*
[23:48:35] <nomagno> IB implementations need to act CONSISTENLY
[23:48:48] <nomagno> sizeof(int) is an example yes
[23:48:49] <pyzozord> and implementation decide to define ub?
[23:48:50] <nomagno> It will never cause a crash
[23:49:09] <nomagno> pyzozord: It may decide to define UB sometimes, yes
[23:49:11] <pyzozord> meaning un-undefine it
[23:49:25] <oldlaptop> UB does not exactly mean "you can't do it". Yes, an implementation is perfectly at liberty to rigorously define something that is UB according to the standard.
[23:49:32] <bjs> pyzozord: UB means the entire program can do anything,  but the compiler can say for example that "if you do it, we'll do XYZ"
[23:49:37] <oldlaptop> (For example, see gcc -fwrapv and -ftrapv)
[23:49:46] <bjs> pyzozord: but then that's outside of "C" and is more "GCC Lang" :)
[23:50:20] <nomagno> for example, in C an 8-bit signed int
[23:50:24] <nomagno> 127 + 1
[23:50:31] <pyzozord> ok then the difference between ub and ib is simply "your compiler may handle this well but doesn't have to" vs "your compiler will handle this well"
[23:50:36] *** Quits: wisep__ (~rickybob@gateway/vpn/pia/rickybob) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:50:45] <oldlaptop> pyzozord: That's a reasonable way to think about it.
[23:50:48] <nomagno> Assuming 127 is the maximum representable number on an 8-bit int, overflow may fail
[23:51:04] <nomagno> It often doesn't fail, on most platforms
[23:51:24] <nomagno> But the compiler can assume your signed int will never overflow, to optimize
[23:51:57] <oldlaptop> nomagno: Maybe a more practically relevant example: for(int index = 0; index > 0; index++) do_observable_thing(index); // what happens?
[23:52:13] <pyzozord> 'undefined behaviour' is simply "compiler's optin imeplementation defined behaviour"
[23:52:35] <oldlaptop> pyzozord: The compiler could make a choice to define it, but doesn't have to.
[23:52:36] *** Quits: tofran (~tofran@bl15-47-228.dsl.telepac.pt) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[23:52:57] <pyzozord> yes, it may optout and instead use the ub to do some optimizations
[23:53:10] <oldlaptop> If some corner case is UB anyway, the compiler can just not handle it, and whatever insane nonsense happens is all A-OK.
[23:53:16] <nomagno> pyzozord: Yeah, that's reasonable phrasing

[23:53:43] <pyzozord> then I think I finally get it
[23:54:05] <nomagno> It makes sense, if you think about it. C is a gen-3 language
[23:54:11] <nomagno> It abstracts over architectures, but doesn't hide them
[23:54:13] <pyzozord> there was few confusions on top of each other
[23:54:18] <vdamewood> Well, also with undefined behavior, a compiler can change how it handles undefined behavior without it being considered a breaking change.
[23:54:43] <lf94> Anyone know of a tool to search through program memory?
[23:54:44] <vdamewood> So Foo Compiler 1.0.2 might handle it diffnerently from Foo Compiler 1.1.0 or even 1.0.3.
[23:54:44] <oldlaptop> In practice, real-world possibilities for my loop above include: absolutely nothing, an infinite loop, and INT_MAX calls to do_observable_thing()
