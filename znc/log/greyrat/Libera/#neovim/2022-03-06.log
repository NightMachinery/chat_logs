If you have a setup that works, there’s nothing wrong with using Vimscript. But if you do want to use Lua, for linting, I use (and recommend) nvim-lint. Packer.nvim is a popular Lua plugin manager, but there is also nvim-paq

[05:26:38] <nova> one thing I can appreciate after rewriting rather a lot of vim-script config in lua .. very slowly on the weekends .. is that vim-script is much nicer for configuration and also editor-specific things (that aren't heavy duty) - eg, making a text-object or a mapping or a command, doing some plumbing, etc. But I like the idea of lua, and I hope it keeps getting better and better and maybe even
[05:26:40] <nova> replaces vim-script :3 hehe
[05:27:51] <nova> you also lose syntax highlighting cuz everything is strings and tables and functions and not as simple, but that's not so bad

[06:08:19] <darkstorm> nova the uppercase registers to which you can append text
[06:08:54] <darkstorm> how to reset those
[06:09:44] <nova> darkstorm, do you mean when you do "Ayiw for example?
[06:09:55] <darkstorm> yes
[06:10:24] <nova> darkstorm, "A{yank-operation} yanks and appends to the (lower-case) @a register
[06:10:41] <nova> "a{yank-operation} yanks but deletes before the (lower-case) @a register
[06:11:23] <nova> similarly, qa{macro}q records a macro to @a (and deletes @a before starting macro) while qA{macro}q appends macro to @a
[06:11:43] <darkstorm> it overwrites the lowercase but appends to the uppercase
[06:12:03] <darkstorm> so how to clear the uppercase
[06:12:08] <darkstorm> register
[06:12:47] <nova> I have no idea what you're talking about. If you do "ayiw"Ayiw and then do :registers, there is no "A - only "a
[06:13:04] <nova> (because "A appends to a reg)
[06:13:20] <nova> are you sure you're in vim/neovim - and not like ... something else?
[06:14:16] <darkstorm> if i do "Ap it will paste all the appended text
[06:14:33] <darkstorm> yes I'm using neovim
[06:14:38] <nova> darkstorm, it's the same as "ap
[06:14:57] <darkstorm> no
[06:15:17] <darkstorm> the help in neo vim mentions the uppercase registers
[06:16:58] <nova> the only part in help that is mentioned about "upper[case]" registers is when it says that uppercase registers are used to append to the alpha registers
[06:17:19] <nova> I just tested "ap and "Ap after doing "ay$"Ay$ - they were the same for me. I don't know how they could be different
[06:18:00] <darkstorm> "ap will paste the last yank / delete
[06:18:14] <nova> no, it pastes the @a register

[11:08:53] <GuySherman[m]> alec: I'm trying to make a plugin that runs a background instance of `psql` in a job, and then allows me to send SQL commands from a buffer to it, and dumps the output into another buffer. A basic SQL ide if you will.
[11:10:56] <GuySherman[m]> So far I can run individual commands through it eg `psql -c 'SELECT * FROM some_table`, but I can't seem to get it to do anything by just running `psql` and sending input to it via stdin

[18:24:31] <bluemonksr[m]> can a keymap re-evaluate a function each time? I have a lua closure as callback of a keybind with an increment function. When i execute the keypress it only increments the first time I call it, not on subsequent calls
[18:25:12] <gpanders> How are you creating the keymap?
[18:25:50] <bluemonksr[m]> `vim.keymap.set(mode, key, require('mylua')func())`
[18:26:00] *** Joins: polve (~polve@user/polve)
[18:26:48] <gpanders> You need to wrap the `require` in a function
[18:27:10] <gpanders> you are currently calling the function at init time, and then setting the keymap to the result of the function call
[18:27:40] <bluemonksr[m]> tries that with `local foo = function() require... end` and then calling `foo()` in keymap. same issue
[18:27:58] <gpanders> Don’t pass foo()
[18:28:01] <gpanders> Just pass foo
[18:28:23] <gpanders> `foo` is a function, `foo()` is the result of evaluating `foo`
[18:28:35] <gpanders> vim.keymap.set takes a function as its argument
[18:29:41] <bluemonksr[m]> but inside foo is it `foo = function require(..).myfunc() end` or without the `()`
[18:30:11] <gpanders> Inside foo you actually execute what you want to execute, so there you do use parens
[18:31:00] <gpanders> you do not need to create foo by the way. You can just do vim.keymap.set(mode, key, function() require(…).func() end)
[18:33:08] <bluemonksr[m]> tried that. Does not seem to evaluate anymore. Is this where I need to set `expr = true`?
[18:34:35] <gpanders> No
[18:34:53] <gpanders> can you paste exactly what you tried?
[18:35:56] <bluemonksr[m]>     vim.keymap.set({ "i", "s" }, "<C-k>", function()
[18:35:56] <bluemonksr[m]>         require("utils").nextItem()
[18:35:56] <bluemonksr[m]>     end)
[18:37:21] <gpanders> Hmm. That should work. Are you sure it is not evaluating? add an error() call to the function body and see if an error is thrown
[18:39:34] <bluemonksr[m]> if it makes any sense out of context, this is the function... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/e3cd92ac7a7bf5afbd187cd0e584ef6a58f1383a)
[18:41:16] <bluemonksr[m]> i have also tried without the inner function
[18:41:38] <bluemonksr[m]>  * if it makes any sense out of context, this is the function... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/a6e2805a9ff64af886a8b7ab1e5c702f83b7d3e7)
[18:46:02] <gpanders> Oh I see, you have utils.nextItem returning another function
[18:46:23] <gpanders> so it is executing, but when it executes it just returns a function, but that function is never called, so nothing happens
[18:46:43] <gpanders> Why are you returning a function rather than just executing the code directly?
[18:50:10] <bluemonksr[m]> i did try without the inner function. directly returning the table[index] but I get the same problem
[18:51:24] <gpanders> What is in langSettings? What are you returning?
[18:51:59] <bluemonksr[m]> strings to be inserted
[18:52:30] <gpanders> Ah I see, then in that case yes this should be an expr mapping. I didn’t realize that is what you were trying to do when you asked earlier
[18:55:10] <hgc> neovim is not bad!
[18:55:49] <bluemonksr[m]> right! it is working!
[18:55:54] <bluemonksr[m]> with expr

[22:00:20] <LeoNerd> Unlikely. The test case reproduces the bug which is already non-apparent on the WIP-REFLOW branch, but reflow isn't entirely finished yet
[22:00:34] <LeoNerd> Rather than asking what might happen why not ask for what you want..?
[22:01:30] <clason[m]> What I want is to have libvterm up-to-date for 0.7.0 :)
[22:02:33] <LeoNerd> OK. Do you have people to assist me in getting reflow to work then?
[22:02:41] <clason[m]> and as I read it, that bug is what is keeping us from the bump.
[22:03:03] <clason[m]> Not really, no, and that's why I was only asking for information, not actions.
[22:04:20] <LeoNerd> OK.. Well, that's overall the state
[22:04:31] <clason[m]> if there's an fairly self-contained patch that can be extracted from the reflow branch, we could use that in our build scripts. But I don't think that's realistic?
[22:04:59] <LeoNerd> No. Reflow is basically a total rewrite of the "resize" logic, and already doesn't manifest the bug that the test case demonstrates
[22:05:14] <clason[m]> gotcha. then that answers my question fully. thanks!
[22:05:14] <LeoNerd> The prior code does have it, and someone hacked up a partial revert of some earlier code that apparently fixes it
[22:05:40] <LeoNerd> I have verylittle confidence in just applying that, because there must have been a reason to make that change in the first place, so I'm unsure why just backhacking it would be useful
[22:05:59] <LeoNerd> I suspect if that was applied it would only cause other cases to break, but those happen not to have tests currently so it isn't immediately visible
[22:06:03] <clason[m]> yeah
[22:06:15] <LeoNerd> I'd rather progress forward (namely: by having reflow working), because people seem to want reflow
[22:06:22] <LeoNerd> Although nobody wants to help make it happen. So.. eh.
[22:06:30] <LeoNerd> It'll be along someyear when I happen to have enough spare time
[22:06:36] <clason[m]> yep, sorry...
[22:06:51] <muniter[m]> How can we help at reflow? Test cases? 
[22:07:08] <LeoNerd> Test cases, or just fixing some of the currently-huge actual segfaulting bugs
[22:07:23] <LeoNerd> I can veryeasily make it break. _finding_ the bugs isn't the problem ;)
[22:07:52] <LeoNerd> Start a brand new pangoterm. cat pangoterm.c (just to have some interesting content). make the terminal much wider. Then shrink it back down. It immediately segfaults and dies
[22:09:23] <bfredl> LeoNerd: I am, as usual interested to help with reflow. just tell us what we need to do :]
[22:09:50] <LeoNerd> test it, help me find and fix the bugs
[22:10:39] <bfredl> is there a branch for pangoterm? or just build pangoterm trunk with the libvterm branch?
[22:11:08] <bfredl> also what is the new location of the libvterm.REFLOW branch, I couldn't find the old location last time I was curious to check out progress
[22:11:11] <LeoNerd> unmodified pangoterm. Which means it doesn't even *enable* reflow yet, so it shouldn't actually be any different. except it is... :( Which itself is the bug
[22:11:29] <LeoNerd> http://bazaar.leonerd.org.uk/c/libvterm.WIP-REFLOW/  currently
[22:11:36] <LeoNerd> give or take an 'https'
[22:11:59] <bfredl> I'd rather test the reflow branch with reflow enabled, but could just be me.
[22:12:51] <LeoNerd> Well you can also do that with a oneline addition of  vterm_screen_set_reflow(vt->screen, true);  at a strategic place on startup

[22:17:20] <bfredl> (that was probably eons ago now tho, time is a flat circle etc etc)
[22:17:32] <LeoNerd> Unsure what version of pango broke it

[22:28:34] <bfredl> ok now I can compile something. and it spits out a lot of debug messages
[22:28:38] <bfredl> progress I guess
[22:28:47] <wroathe> Hey guys, I'm using ncm2 and they require an autocommand that calls a plugin function on bufenter. If I haven't yet installed the plugin it throws an error because it can't find that defined function in any of my autoload scripts. Is there a way to make it silently fail?
[22:28:59] <wroathe> This is the offending line?     Plug 'ncm2/ncm2-bufword'
[22:29:06] <wroathe> Oops, one sec
[22:29:20] <wroathe> au BufEnter * call ncm2#enable_for_buffer()
[22:29:36] <wroathe> That's it. Sorry, I haven't figured out why wl-copy isn't working as intended on linux yet either :P
[22:30:06] <bfredl> leonerd: pangoterm.c:2053:33: error: invalid use of incomplete typedef 'VTerm'
[22:30:23] <wroathe> So this line is working as intended, but I'm trying to find something in the documentation that will let this fail quietly if it can't find ncm2#enable_for_buffer (in the event that I've loaded my vimrc into a vim session where I haven't yet installed my plugins)
[22:30:28] <bfredl> when I do like suggested :P
[22:31:22] <bfredl> ah, there is a magic method to get screen object
[22:32:18] <bfredl> now it does some kind of half-working reflow :]

[22:55:29] <mjlbach[m]> wroathe: I would consider replace ncm2
[22:55:36] <mjlbach[m]> iirc the author uses emacs now
[22:56:35] <bfredl> LeoNerd: hmm I don't get segfault yet, just that it does not always reflow correctly (as I expect it)
[22:56:44] <LeoNerd> Mmmm
[22:56:54] <LeoNerd> Well that's fun and different
[22:57:19] <bfredl> I could build it with ASAN/UBSAN.
[22:57:36] <LeoNerd> You could try.. I've valgrind'ed it already
[22:57:48] <bfredl> that would catch UB errors which sometimes are segfaults and sometimes incorrect noncrashing behaviour :]
[22:57:50] <LeoNerd> It's unlikely to give interesting results
[22:58:10] <LeoNerd> It crashes because it tries to reflow by copying from or two invalid cells, because it has some out of bounds value for row or column number
[22:58:13] <LeoNerd> This is already known
[22:58:18] <LeoNerd> What isn't known is *why* those numbers are invalid
[22:58:42] <LeoNerd> So while we could easily change the code into some asserts on the position, that'll just turn it into a reliable assertion failure
[22:58:50] <bfredl> LeoNerd: yes. I mean I could observe the same issue. just that I don't get the crash
[22:59:03] <bfredl> an ASAN traceback is 10x more useful than misbehavior, even if we already know there is a problem
[22:59:42] <bfredl> there is a difference between "the c code is valid c code, but it does the wrong thing" and UB, and I like to know which is which
[23:00:17] <LeoNerd> Yeah, I'm just saying that'll find the reason for the crash itself, but not the underlying root cause
[23:01:01] <LeoNerd> The crash is usually because the position is out of bounds. The logic ought to have made that impossible but for some reason it isn't
[23:02:07] <bfredl> I will look more into it sometime soon. now I at least have a toy to play with :]
