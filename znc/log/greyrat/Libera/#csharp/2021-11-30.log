[01:14:48] <DevJohnC> touchid kinda wins
[01:15:32] <jonp> i prefer faceid, except w/ masks.  and watchOS unlock massively improves the mask case.
[01:16:49] <DevJohnC> I only have faceid on my phone and it seems to take a bit of time to work; I don't have a smart watch or anything though
[01:17:56] <DevJohnC> for now I'm happy not having to type my password each time I need to log in :D
[01:18:29] <DevJohnC> just gotta figure out how to get my network drives to appear in the sidebar of Finder
[01:22:48] <jonp> drag them to the top "Favorites" section of the sidebar
[01:23:33] <DevJohnC> oh excellent, much thanks :)
[01:23:37] <DevJohnC> macOS is so foreign!
[01:25:20] <BtbN> faceid seems even less secure than fingerprint
[01:25:31] <BtbN> someone can just hold your phone in front of your face and unlock it against your will
[01:25:45] <BtbN> Fingerprints will be at least a little bit harder, but not by much
[01:26:12] <N1N> Isn't it supposed to not work with eyes closed?
[01:26:16] <jonp> if you think you're gonna be in that situation, hold down power+volume for ~5 seconds, or repeated press them together.
[01:26:19] <jonp> closing eyes will also work
[01:27:01] <BtbN> Doesn't work.
[01:27:24] <jonp> how so?
[01:27:40] <BtbN> Well, you tell me?
[01:27:47] <BtbN> No idea where you got the idea from that it would work.
[01:27:52] <BtbN> Could unlock just fine after doing that.
[01:27:56] <N1N> Just tried and it unlocked after I opened my eyes
[01:27:59] <jonp> if you hold power+volume down, you get to the "slide to power off" screen
[01:28:02] <jonp> once there, faceid won't work
[01:28:05] <jonp> you MUST re-enter the passcode
[01:28:08] <BtbN> I don't have Apple-Ware
[01:28:14] <N1N> Right.
[01:29:35] <xb0o2> BtbN: if you don't have "Apple-Ware", you're not using FaceID so you'll have to forgive everyone for trying to help you.
[01:29:54] <BtbN> Yes, because the feature not being called Apple-Names makes all the difference.
[01:30:04] <jonp> at least it's not Samsung, where a *photograph* will fake out their face detection hardware
[01:30:30] <xb0o2> Well, don't use a term that refers to a specific technology if you're talking about other technologies, then?
[01:30:50] <xb0o2> "Hi, my JSON parser doesn't work but I'm actually using an XML parser, y it no parse json?"
[01:31:18] <BtbN> Maybe don't be such an Apple-Fanboy... Other phones have long figured out how to unlock via Face-Scan.
[01:31:18] <jonp> "my JSON parser doesn't support comments".  "mine does!"
[01:31:25] <jonp> (yes, comments are out of spec for JSON.  whatever.)
[01:32:17] <xb0o2> I'm bot a fanboy, I'm saying you specifically said FaceID and complained that suggestions about FaceID don't work for you.
[01:32:23] <jonp> BtbN: there's a world of difference between "figured out" and "*securely* figured out": https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-s20s-face-unlock-secure
[01:32:43] <jonp> > There's no additional sensor providing depth data, and as such, it is possible for someone else to gain access to your phone with your facsimile. It's easy for facial recognition systems like the one on the S20 to be fooled by a photo
[01:32:47] <BtbN> FaceID is such a generic term, it's just become synonymous with the feature.
[01:33:35] <jonp> Face ID is a trademark, and shouldn't be used generically
[01:33:40] <xb0o2> ^
[01:33:41] <BtbN> lol
[01:34:06] <BtbN> It's as much a trademark as a rectangle with rounded corners is one.
[01:34:10] <BtbN> i.e. only in Apples world.
[01:34:17] <xb0o2> Well, no, it's a trademark in the real world
[01:34:20] <gufi_> calling a thing by another name even if people understand what you're saying isn't correct
[01:34:30] <gufi_> and since were developers we literally deal with nothing but details.

[01:37:22] <xb0o2>  In which case, the advice is, as it has been for years, don't use it.
[01:38:39] <xb0o2> The advice in none of these situations is "get shitty with people trying to help you on IRC"
[01:46:32] <moose> To be fair, the actual rounded border edge thing with the smiley face in it and the words below reading "Face ID" are the trademark.
[01:46:45] <moose> The actual wording "Face ID" is not trademarked.
[01:47:13] <moose> But you have to really love the design search descriptor: Other grotesque men including men formed by plants or objects. Smiley faces. Objects or combinations of objects representing a person. Incomplete squares.
[01:47:34] <Cecen> Is there any way to implement the same generic method with different constraints and have callers resolve the most constrained version?
[01:47:53] <moose> Cecen: Can you give an example of one and the other?
[01:48:41] <Cecen> void Register<T>(T service) where T : class { } void Register<T>(T service) where T : class, new() { }
[01:49:14] <moose> Ah ok you really meant precisely the generic constraints. Then no.
[01:49:37] <moose> I would say if you can make one without the new() constraint then just do it that way.
[01:50:46] <Cecen> T may be an interface and the argument may be an implementation of it
[01:51:16] <moose> So why's it need to be new() then?
[01:51:19] <Cecen> The non-new() version uses Activator, which breaks Unity because it can't tell that the constructor is being used
[01:51:33] <moose> Ah, you are actually instantiating a new instance of it instead of just consuming it?
[01:51:54] <moose> I guess there's probably some Unity nuances. Never played with Unity much :(
[01:52:37] <Suchiman> Cecen: no, constraints are not overloadable
[01:52:55] <Suchiman> as they're not part of the signature
[01:53:00] <xb0o2> Hi Suchiman :-)
[01:53:06] <Suchiman> hi
[01:53:39] <moose> Suchiman: Do you ever wish that we had real templates?
[01:53:42] <moose> C++ templates, that is.
[01:53:55] <Suchiman> moose: sometimes a little bit
[01:54:04] <Cecen> I'd kill for C++ templates, or even more intelligent resolution of generic arguments
[01:54:14] <moose> Very rare occasions I have desired them, but my gosh sometimes they are a great thing.
[01:54:21] <Suchiman> moose: indeed
[01:54:52] <xb0o2> I struggle with a lot of the features in C#.
[01:55:02] <moose> xb0o2: Like what?
[01:55:12] <jonp> Cecen: C#10 source generators?
[01:55:25] <xb0o2> Not because they're not useful but because they lead to problems with a lot of my team members that are juniors.
[01:55:45] <Cecen> Source generators are way too manual, last I looked at them
[01:55:49] <xb0o2> I *personally* would love to go way further and have more and more of our code base enforce type safety.
[01:56:14] <Cecen> In most of my scenarios, I have high hundreds to thousands of lines of code that I want templated by the consumer
[01:56:18] <xb0o2> But also I can, somewhat painfully, work on Go projects that I know our junior devs would grok.
[01:56:23] <jonp> Cecen: T4?

[01:56:53] <moose> xb0o2: Which features would you want to improve type safety of?
[01:56:54] <Cecen> I've never had a project where T4 templates weren't intrusive to dev builds
[01:57:37] <moose> Cecen: Doesn't ASP .NET use T4 templates all over?

[02:00:20] <xb0o2> Unfortunately our codebase isn't that modern and as it stands a lot of it isn't going to ever be that modern :)
[02:00:40] <moose> I never understood how companies let things go so badly.
[02:00:53] <xb0o2> What's your situation where you work?
[02:00:56] <moose> Not to say that your code base is bad, just in general. Lots of tech debt, never gets upgraded, makes life hell for someone later.
[02:01:26] <moose> I have upgraded all of our internal projects for my team to .NET 6 that are going to be alive longer than the next 24 months.
[02:01:40] <xb0o2> Oh, it's bad. It's the culmination of massively underbudgeting what is a key driver of the business' success as it scaled from a small family business to an employer of 000s.
[02:02:15] <Suchiman> moose: sweet
[02:02:23] <moose> So we're on VS 2022 and using .NET 6 and C++20
[02:02:33] <N1N> Noice
[02:02:43] <moose> Yeah it's quite something.
[02:02:51] <xb0o2> We're on a new project is 5+ situation.
[02:03:12] <xb0o2> But the vast majority of our codebase is not so lucky.
[02:03:41] <moose> Yeah, I have been at companies where the code bases were very old. I used to work for a payment gateway service many of the folks here have used ;)
[02:03:49] <xb0o2> And we have 15+ years of poorly architected legacy code built up in our system so... you can imagine the fun we have :-)
[02:04:00] <moose> It was very bad. Lots of .NET 2.0 code still exists today I hear, C++ code is actually C with classes.
[02:04:19] <xb0o2> We upgraded from .NET 2.0 to 4.0 in the last year...
[02:04:25] <moose> At least you upgraded.
[02:04:39] <xb0o2> Target runtime of the web project has not, however.
[02:04:42] <xb0o2> So no async code.
[02:04:51] <moose> These folks have no intention to upgrade. I was pushing when I worked there to get us on to a new VS version by just upgrading the project files and replacing removed features.
[02:05:04] <moose> It was quite a nightmare.
[02:05:15] <xb0o2> The number of actually async packages we depend on that we've had to manually revert to sync code is obscene.
[02:05:43] <moose> I remember the good old days without async/await
[02:05:44] <xb0o2> And obviously we are then forced to review every release they make, and if applicable, do the work again...
[02:06:05] <xb0o2> Don't get me wrong, I am all on the async train, but the codebase we work with isn't :)
[02:06:11] <moose> Aye
[02:06:14] <xb0o2> We are all hostages.
[02:06:22] <moose> Haha I remember when async/await came out, I was like "this can't be fast at all, it's terrible!"
[02:06:43] <xb0o2> Hostages to the terrible decisions made by people that left the company 15+, 10+, 5+ years ago
[02:06:53] <moose> Maybe at the time they were good decisions.
[02:07:11] <xb0o2> I can forgive some of them.
[02:08:02] <xb0o2> Such is life.
[02:08:11] <moose> I've had people go on about some code I wrote before that looked bad to them. They were talking down about how I didn't use Linq or something. I said "Linq wasn't even on the roadmap when I wrote this."
[02:08:25] <moose> It was great, they didn't even realize I had written it :)
[02:08:27] <xb0o2> Oh
[02:08:36] <xb0o2> Did I mention it was all VB?
[02:08:43] <moose> Ah, fun.
[02:09:14] <xb0o2> I mean, modern VB is not my language of choice but at least for the most part it has feature parity with C#.
[02:09:27] <xb0o2> But old VB.NET was absolutely vile
[02:09:59] <xb0o2> And yes, we had references to LinqBridge until the upgrade was done
[02:10:09] <moose> I've seen weird stuff done in VBS, like making XML RPC calls to MS Access from the client side of old classic ASP apps lol
[02:10:10] <xb0o2> Because I outright refused not to use Linq ;)
[02:10:18] <moose> I thought initially when you said VB you meant VBS
[02:10:34] <xb0o2> Oh, no, not VBS, just old VB.NET
[02:11:01] <xb0o2> Back when C# supported anonymous functions and VB didn't
[02:11:22] <moose> I think I picked C# as a language to learn because it looked more like C++ than VB did.
[02:11:38] <moose> I hated "dim" in VB. Just very annoying syntax to me.
[02:11:45] <xb0o2> I've worked with VB.NET on and off for most of my career
[02:11:51] <xb0o2> I've always hated it
[02:12:07] <xb0o2> You're right, the verbosity is horrible
[02:12:31] <xb0o2> But also so are lot of the choices in the language design

[02:52:44] <moose> In fact they heat up at the same rate per unit area.
[02:52:46] <MaNa2k> and its suppose to only replace the first part of the rocket, which is the one that uses most fuel
[02:53:24] <moose> Yes because it's expensive to bring fuel up so they engineer the thrust:weight ratio to ensure it's very slow to go up, making the most of that fue

[02:53:41] <moose> But anyway, so now they're flinging a smaller fueled payload up to 200,000 ft ideally.

[03:02:02] <moose> Suchiman: Well it depends on how long the boom is, but yes.
[03:02:28] <moose> You need to know the radius of the system and the rotations per minute to calculate it :p
[03:03:10] <MaNa2k> moose, i dont think the tech is improving fast enough like it did those times. soon they wont be able to keep up with moorse law
[03:03:24] <moose> Seems like it would be around 10,000xg
[03:03:37] <moose> or more
[03:04:04] <moose> MaNa2k: Moore's law isn't as important now, since we're seeing limitations in other areas
[03:04:10] <moose> And it's pretty irrelevant to space flight IMO
[03:04:14] <moose> Or colonizing another planet
[03:04:36] <moose> The main thing with travel to Mars is probably social. The safety of doing it. We went to the moon but we did it at a time when the world was battling to get there. There's no mars space race yet.
[03:04:54] <moose> The moon landings were horribly unsafe, it's a wonder people survived.

[03:06:22] <moose> Elon Musk isn't deploying Tesla for terrestrial use, although it may appear that way. There's a reason that the cyber truck has a hermetically sealed internal system and is positively pressurized for "rider comfort and air quality"
[03:06:42] <moose> You'll notice the main area of research for Tesla is their battery technology specifically in cold climates.
[03:07:28] <moose> MaNa2k: The point is to become multiplanetary, as a staging ground to say we can do it. To imbue the society of the world with the thought that they can do things that appear impossible, IMO.

[03:07:57] <Suchiman> moose: googling about it, the final system should have a diameter of 100m so the radius is 50m and the rpm can be calculated from that using the final velocity it will reach of 8km/h
[03:08:00] <Suchiman> 8km/s xD
[03:08:04] <moose> It's not even just like one of those "Hey look what America can do" things. It would be a next step in the evolution of us as a whole species.
[03:10:10] <moose> That is a very large thing, Suchiman
[03:10:28] <Suchiman> indeed
[03:11:00] <Suchiman> i wonder how many satelites could withstand 10000g
[03:12:27] <MaNa2k> they better not put a nuke in that
[03:14:13] <moose> So it's like 61rpm, they probably designed it to exactly 60rpm so we'll assume that. It's 31,604xg roughly.
[03:15:15] <Suchiman> really? only 60rpm? wow just one rotation a second, but yeah that G force is dope! challenge: do that for fighter jet training xD
[03:15:46] <moose> Lemme double check my number for the rpm, since it does sound slow.
[03:16:25] <moose> Yep, 61.13
[03:16:47] <moose> But that g-force is the relative centrifugal force, which I THINK applies here.
[03:17:03] <BtbN> It would strip the flesh from any pilots bones.
[03:17:07] <moose> Yes.
[03:17:23] <Suchiman> xD

[05:18:24] <moose> Does it, though?
[05:20:26] <moose> My initial impression is that mutators is a Func<int, int>[100] and that each func is equivalent to (x) => x + i where i is the index into mutators.
[05:20:49] <moose> So your first would be equal to 0 + x and the second is equal to 1 + x ...
[05:22:30] <moose> Cecen: So basically to me it's not clear what the return value of "(existingValue) => existingValue + 1" is if it's not a function and rather a value.
[05:23:04] <moose> Does existingValue get captured and stored over the entire loop?
[05:25:28] <moose> Nah, my initial impression is correct.
[05:26:56] <moose> But now I am stumped, why is it incrementing them by 100. Just tested, it really does.

[06:27:36] <jonp> moose: because `i` is captured as part of the closure.
[06:28:23] <jonp> if you don't want it in the closure, you need to introduce a temporary: for (var i = 0; i < 100; ++i) { var v = i; mutators[i] = existingValue => existingValue + v; }
[06:30:06] <moose> Even though it's captured in the closure, I still don't get it :/
[06:30:17] <jonp> *or*, use a construct which introduces a new value: foreach (var v in Enumerable.Range (0, 100)) mutators [v] = n => n + v;
[06:30:22] <moose> I'd expect it to be incrementing by 0 then.
[06:30:36] <jonp> when the `for` loop completes, `i` is 100, not 0
[06:30:45] <jonp> and all the delegates *share* that same instance of `i`
[06:31:08] <moose> So basically because it's captured, it's referenced in the actual closure for the lifetime of the variable even through many iterations
[06:31:22] <moose> Essentially, assume here that the variable is passed by ref.
[06:31:27] <jonp> yes.
[06:31:34] <moose> That is awfully confusing if you are not paying close attention
[06:31:35] <jonp> closure variables are read/write
[06:31:58] <moose> I think there should be a way to flag it one way or the other, like explicitly mark it ref or something.
[06:32:09] <moose> How does this apply to other structs, still the same?
[06:32:16] <jonp> yup
[06:32:33] <moose> I wonder how it works with readonly ref structs
[06:32:44] <moose> I imagine it just doesn't
[06:33:21] <jonp> it can't work with `ref struct`s
[06:33:27] <jonp> readonly or otherwise
[06:33:53] <moose> That makes even less sense, especially if the closure is guaranteed to be local.
[06:34:02] <jonp> closures are GC-allocated
[06:34:06] <jonp> and ref structs can't be in the heap
[06:34:09] <moose> Ah, ok
[06:34:16] <moose> I forget that they have to be on the heap

[13:22:32] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: I think I figured it out maybe!
[13:22:43] <Nasp> Tado?
[13:25:14] <biberu> MatthiasVance: i've just told my bosses yet, they wanted to keep ofc (making money), but since i was a consultant and working with other clients than the others i don't think there'll be any special reactions
[13:34:21] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Yeah!
[13:34:28] <Nasp> So what was the issue
[13:34:30] <Nasp> Offset?
[13:34:53] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: So it needs more heat in my office, so it heats the water. Then it stops heating and turns off the radiator. But the water is still hot so the area around the sensor / valve might get hotter while the rest of the room doesn't
[13:35:02] <MatthiasVance> No fix :(
[13:35:04] <Nasp> Ahh
[13:35:14] <MatthiasVance> Haven't looked into it further but this seems plausible at least
[13:35:23] <Nasp> But shouldn't tado be able to know that
[13:35:34] <Nasp> But i've had a bit of the same feeling that their flow control isn't that great
[13:35:54] <MatthiasVance> How should it know that?
[13:35:58] <MatthiasVance> idk :D
[13:36:10] <Nasp> Because it should know that by previous data
[13:36:17] <Nasp> How long it takes to heat and so on
[13:37:06] <MatthiasVance> Yeah but it can't know *why* it's getting hotter
[13:37:29] <MatthiasVance> Maybe lowering water temp might help as well with that :)
[13:37:32] <MatthiasVance> Now it's probably 80C

[13:57:21] <MatthiasVance> yes
[13:57:29] <MatthiasVance> so the water next to the radiator (in the pipe) is still hot
[13:57:35] <MatthiasVance> and BECAUSE the valve is closing

[14:18:23] <MaNa3k> so is this definition correct on what "pull request" is?  basically when you want to make a change to a branch, you do a pull request and ask for permission from the owner of the branch. After the owner gives you permission, you do some changes and push the changes, but then the changes has to get accepted by the branch owner?
[14:18:40] <MaNa3k> is this all part of "pull request"
[14:20:13] <canton7> MaNa3k, traditionally, a "pull request" is an email saying "Hey, I've made some commits in branch X in the repository at URL Y. Please pull them into your main branch". Websites like GitHub have written a nice web interface around this concept: instead of writing an email, you click a button, and GitHub creates a PR page and sends an email for you,
[14:20:13] <canton7> but the concept is the same: "please pull the commits from this branch in this repo into your main branch"
[14:20:53] <canton7> It's a request to the person (or people) responsible for a repo, to fetch some commits from your repo and merge them into their repo
[14:21:16] <MaNa3k> canton7, ah i see
[14:21:34] <MaNa3k> so you dont really need to get permission to access the branch
[14:21:45] <MaNa3k> but only get the branch accepted by the owner
[14:24:24] <canton7> Yes: it's up to the repo maintainer(s) whether they decide to merge your commits into their repo. They need permission to see those commits of yours (of course), but you don't need permission to do anything to their repo: indeed, you're not doing anything to their repo. You're just asking them to incorporate your commits
[14:24:45] <MaNa3k> ok ok

[15:13:20] <planetcalls|work> The phone is not just about the hardware. It is also about the software and continued updates for feature and security. Sadly, for most android OEMs, you are of no value after you have purchased a device.
[15:14:01] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: What about the new Pixel?
[15:14:48] <planetcalls|work> MatthiasVance, its pretty much the same story. Google is not very interested in running their phone business.
[15:15:05] <MatthiasVance> But at least you will get upgrades?
[15:15:07] <MatthiasVance> *updates
[15:15:09] <planetcalls|work> Also, data privacy is not a concern for google as their entire business model is built around creating services based on your data
[15:15:33] <MatthiasVance> Well, yes. But if you value that ( :P ) you shouldn't buy a Google Android either way>
[15:15:34] <MatthiasVance> * ?
[15:16:05] <planetcalls|work> I have an iPhone 7 which still receives new iOS updates (both feature and security) on day 1 with any other modern iphone
[15:16:34] <planetcalls|work> I think it is perfectly capable for most of my needs
[15:17:32] <planetcalls|work> In comparison I have an android device with Snapdragon 835 which was released after iphone 7 and has not received any update since last 2 years now!
[15:18:01] <planetcalls|work> so in the long run I think the iPhones pay off. If you are switching your phone yearly or every 2 years, then probably it doesn't matter
[15:18:21] <shadowchaser> planetcalls|work that's still not bad, it used to be that android phone makers dropped the support as soon as new version of their device was out
[15:18:27] <planetcalls|work> But most of the world as I know, uses their phones as long as it is capable of serving their needs.
[15:18:56] <planetcalls|work> shadowchaser, android phone makers have no value in keeping the device running for long because they don't benefit from the ecosystem the way apple does.
[15:19:11] <planetcalls|work> for most of them, the value is in selling newer devices.
[15:20:12] <planetcalls|work> I dont want the latest shiny android features. Just give me the security updates which gives me the sense of being secured knowing that the APIs being abused are fixed and I can continue using the device.
[15:21:13] <shadowchaser> planetcalls|work true

[15:43:01] <planetcalls|work> shadowchaser, in relation to android primarily. Open Source by itself doesn't become great. It has to have a discipline and administration behind it. We have plenty of examples where an open source was abandoned because the developer didn't have enough time and community was not strong.

[16:56:32] <SKull> :]
[16:57:05] <SKull> interop_madness: i'm an ex coke head. i could smell that video when i saw it. sweat, cigarettes and gasoline up your nose

[16:59:15] <interop_madness> apparently they didn't consume coke on the video
[17:00:39] <SKull>  interop_madness: they didn't consume it ON video. but they were completely coked up.... also you went after the mayor of that skiing town that was a major COVID hotspot. that it some working justice right there. i wish Switzerland would've reacted the same way in this scenario
[17:01:18] <interop_madness> Ischgl was VERY early in the pandemic, nobody knew shit back then
[17:01:48] <interop_madness> this was very spooky, there were a lot of posts on social media from tourists visiting austria why nobody is doing something against the infections in Ischgl
[17:02:33] <interop_madness> obviously they should have closed it all down, but back then, there wasn't exactly a guidance for proper management of this disease, except "better too extreme measures than sorry"
[17:03:49] <SKull> interop_madness: yeah, but they did nothing for weeks AFTER it was clear they had to shut down. they knew full well and played it down

[17:45:34] <MaNa3k> jesus, this question "what are your future ambitions"
[17:52:07] <canton7> Fair question? Make sure you have a good answer for it. But it lets people know e.g. if you're heading down the management track, or want to become a technical expert/SME, whether you want to move sideways into any particular fields, etc

[17:56:52] <Nasp> Might also be me who made some bad asumpotions
[17:56:58] <Nasp> I am trying to check if a route exists before calling it
[17:57:05] <Nasp> And i might have fucked up in that
[17:59:33] <canton7> Yeah, "What do you want to do in future" is a perfectly reasonable question from someone who's trying to work out how they can help you do what you want to do

[18:06:44] <MatthiasVance> sysRPL:
[18:06:47] <MatthiasVance> 🎉
[18:06:51] <Nasp> I understand nothing of this routing
[18:06:55] <Nasp> It's completely fucked
[18:07:08] <MatthiasVance> Also, I stand corrected, GeForce Now *does* remember your Steam account info
[18:07:12] <MatthiasVance> But you cannot paste it in
[18:07:15] <sysRPL> as i experienced how seemingly random people will defend their wrong positions to the highest degree. even if they really didn't `make` that decision
[18:07:19] <Nasp> why does geforce need your steam login?
[18:08:10] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Because you pay for the GPU not the games
[18:08:33] <sysRPL> and their strong defense of their wrong positions is quite dependent of the manner in which they are questioned about those positions
[18:08:45] <Nasp> I have made this weird situation where when a route is foudn the controller isnt
[18:09:47] <MatthiasVance> I don't know what that means :D
[18:09:56] <MatthiasVance> Because registering a route has nothing to do with a controller
[18:10:01] <sysRPL> this could apply to anything including eating habits, clothing attire, their holiday shopping, the computer hardware ... anything
[18:10:07] <Nasp> I have thing that thinks 1234 is a route
[18:10:25] <Nasp> Or /api/controllerroutethatdoesntexist
[18:12:45] <sysRPL> for example, if someone bought a computer and they did not consider or think about buying one with solid state media (including m.2 drive) when questioned a they will predominately proclaim solid state media to be the bad decision

[18:30:05] <moose> sysRPL: To your initial point regarding the method of questioning. I've noticed that instead of asking people why they made a decision, that they respond so much better if you ask how something you know won't work, would work in the confines of their solution and let them come to the ah-ha moment themselves.
[18:31:41] <sysRPL> moose: yes
[18:31:56] <moose> Especially with programming. Say an obvious one where someone didn't use a lock to guard some resource, you could then you ask "Should we allow two requests to be processed simultaneously?" even though you know they intended for it to work, they may say yes we allow that and then you've got them on their "I am thinking ahead of this person" confident mentality and you can ask more direct questions.

[22:42:12] <ki9a> MatthiasVance: do you have any experience with omgevingsloket ?
[22:42:16] <biberu> there's an extra checkbox fir that
[22:42:29] <tlf> oh, thanks for pointing that out
[22:42:34] <tlf> I';d have never thought to look1
[22:42:37] <biberu> after all, you want to test that your cache *works* too
[22:42:54] <MatthiasVance> ki9a: Is that the thing where you ask for permits?
[22:42:57] <ki9a> yes
[22:43:01] <MatthiasVance> ki9a: Or when you report a broken light etc
[22:43:02] <ki9a> i guess that answers is
[22:43:05] <ki9a> it
[22:43:14] <MatthiasVance> I filed for a permit to cut down a tree :D
[22:43:25] <ki9a> haha
[22:44:10] <tlf> lol wtf?
[22:44:24] <ki9a> there's this whole system for it
[22:44:32] <tlf> is this a commune?
[22:44:35] <ki9a> i wondering if it's going to stay on "in progress" now for 8 weeks
[22:44:46] <ki9a> or if it actually updates over time
[22:45:01] <ki9a> tlf: most countries require a permit to build a house

[22:45:13] <tlf> but not to cut a tree down
[22:45:19] <MatthiasVance> ki9a: Hm can't remember :D
[22:45:24] <tlf> man, I'd spend weeks filing if I had to do that
[22:45:35] <ki9a> NL requires a permit to cut down a tree
[22:45:42] <MatthiasVance> If it's above a certain size
[22:45:47] <MatthiasVance> This was a fucking huge one
[22:45:53] <ki9a> yeah
[22:45:55] <tlf> good thing I live in the absolute freest of free countries
[22:45:56] <ki9a> but that's easily reached...
[22:46:06] <ki9a> it's a 10 cm diameter iirc
[22:46:11] <MatthiasVance> nahh
[22:46:14] <MatthiasVance> 75cm at 1.5m
[22:46:30] <MatthiasVance> Something like that
[22:46:39] <ki9a> 75 cm??
[22:46:45] <tlf> thats good wittling wood
[22:46:47] <MatthiasVance> Yeah because I only hda to do it for the big one
[22:46:53] <ki9a> you mean 7.5 right?
[22:47:07] <MatthiasVance> no
[22:47:13] <ki9a> ooh
[22:47:15] <jonp> how tall was this tree?
[22:47:17] <ki9a> looks like it's per city
[22:47:23] <jonp> 100'?
[22:47:33] *** Joins: Haxxa (~Haxxa@125-63-20-105.ip4.superloop.com)
[22:47:44] <tlf> depends on the species
[22:48:02] <ki9a> but if a tree is 75 cm in diameter
[22:48:09] <jonp> fair, but if it's ~2.5' diameter at ~5' off the ground (assuming i'm reading that right)
[22:48:12] <ki9a> it's going to require some special folks to cut down...
[22:48:13] <jonp> that's a very big tree
[22:48:21] <tlf> I have an oak that has to be roughly 200 years old
[22:48:22] <ki9a> yeah
[22:48:31] <ki9a> you could biuld a house
[22:48:33] <tlf> not any taller than the oaks that are 50 yo
[22:48:34] <ki9a> from the wood
[22:48:47] <tlf> easily 5' in diameter
[22:48:58] <jonp> 75cm is ~2.5'
[22:49:04] <MatthiasVance> ki9a: Ah this one was 64cm diameter
[22:49:05] <jonp> i assume 75cm was diameter, not radius
[22:49:32] <ki9a> still big
[22:49:38] <jonp> 2' diameter is still a big tree!
[22:49:56] <MatthiasVance> Yeah it sure was!
[22:50:13] <ki9a> you cut it down yourself/
[22:50:15] <MatthiasVance> Also it seems you're right ki9a, if it's larger than 10cm diameter at a height of 1.30m
[22:50:23] <MatthiasVance> ki9a: Noooo, could never do that (safely)
[22:50:39] <tlf> hweh
[22:50:41] <MatthiasVance> Had a guy do that and also redo our entire front garden
[22:50:43] <ki9a> hah
[22:50:58] <ki9a> I had a lavender bush that ended up as a tree
[22:51:04] <ki9a> cut it down just before it got to this point
[22:51:08] <ki9a> but was still like 5 meters high
[22:51:15] <MatthiasVance> Ah wow
[22:51:24] <tlf> when I was clearing the property of all the ash trees before fencing, there was a very awkward tree I that got hung up on another one
[22:51:49] <tlf> unbeknownst to me, as I was trying to get it off the other tree, my gf pulled right behind me in my "oh fuck run" zone
[22:51:52] <ki9a> wasn't entirely safe to cut down though :)
[22:51:54] <tlf> I almost killed her myself
[22:52:07] <ki9a> the funny thing is, I cut it down till the dirt level
[22:52:12] <ki9a> now there's a new bush
[22:52:16] <ki9a> is that the right word?
[22:52:27] <tlf> ki9a, yeah
[22:52:35] <ki9a> the tree stump ended up sprouting leaves again
[22:52:59] <tlf> some bushes get giant. it can be healthy to cut them down if they get too scraggly
[22:53:02] <MatthiasVance> Yeah that's why I had it taken all the way down
[22:53:12] <MatthiasVance> Next day a circle of water in my front yard

[22:53:31] <MatthiasVance> But the roots of the big tree were just gushing with water
[22:53:33] <tlf> lol, no the water was always there, the tree just sucked it up
[22:53:33] <MatthiasVance> (which got hit)
[22:53:46] <MatthiasVance> Almost ;)
[22:54:14] <tlf> we've planted dozens of willow trees to soak up along the back tree line in the pasture

[23:09:21] <jonp> what aspect :-D
[23:09:24] <viaSanctus> someone figured out an easy way to do it...xunit found out...immediately advices against it
[23:09:28] <viaSanctus> lol

[23:09:34] *** Quits: malt (~malt@user/malt) (Quit: WeeChat 2.8)
[23:09:41] <jonp> writing an xUnit test *runner*?  incredibly difficult.
[23:10:07] <jonp> i have it on good authority that it's overly abstracted, overly interface oriented, and a pain to deal with
[23:10:40] <jonp> ("good authority" being the person who wrote an xUnit test runner for use on Xamarin.Android unit tests…)

[23:11:24] <jonp> viaSanctus: xUnit is fine for writing tests
[23:11:33] <jonp> it's writing test *runners* where it all goes south

[23:12:05] <jonp> that said, we're still largely using NUnit
[23:12:20] <viaSanctus> jonp, i can deal with this console.write, but i'm afraid i'll run into one after the other "simple" but required thing with it
[23:12:31] <MatthiasVance> What are you doing with the console even
[23:12:38] <Nasp> xunit runner isn't that because vstest is bad
[23:12:39] <MatthiasVance> You are testing units
[23:12:40] <viaSanctus> MatthiasVance, messaging to myself
[23:12:49] <MatthiasVance> What kind of messages?
[23:12:54] <MatthiasVance> During unit testing??
[23:12:55] <viaSanctus> i'm trying to understand how these tests run
[23:12:57] <viaSanctus> yes
[23:13:01] <MatthiasVance> ah
[23:13:12] <jonp> MatthiasVance: not everyone likes using a debugger

[23:13:34] <JakeSays> jonp: something be wrong with 'dem folks
[23:13:34] <Nasp> jonp:  There's a reason none of the unit testing libs have a fully parallel runner
[23:13:35] <jonp> until dealing with goddamn `dotnet test`, which drops shit on the floor

[23:50:10] <viaSanctus> had to access files
[23:50:36] <viaSanctus> didnt want to build extra apis for this

[23:56:11] <viaSanctus> well we are recruitment firm (yeah i know...so "manieth")
[23:56:34] <viaSanctus> but have a very small department that accept projects
[23:56:41] <viaSanctus> now sure how to put this
[23:56:56] <lz_> yay thunderbird deleted all my emails! thunderbird sucks! on the plus side I get to test my backup system now

[23:57:19] <viaSanctus> but in any case thats "my" department and we have about 20 people

[23:57:33] <viaSanctus> very small business stuff (boring mostly)
