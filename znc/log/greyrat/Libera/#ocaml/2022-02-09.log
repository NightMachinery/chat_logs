[05:57:34] <EmmaBonestell> I am fairly new to using OCaml, so apologies if any assumptions I make seem off/are wrong.
[05:57:34] <EmmaBonestell> Additionally, I'm not sure if one would consider the following to be a bug, feature request, etc, so I wasn't sure it was appropriate to submit a bug report on GitHub.
[05:57:34] <EmmaBonestell> I'm working on BAP to get it to work properly on Windoss. It makes extensive use of Dynlink plugins in a manner like this : pack plugins & metadata in zip files -> at runtime, unzip to OS's tmpdir -> Dynlink.fileload the cmxs (or cma) -> delete the unzipped files. This works just fine on Unices and Linux, whereas Windows errors out for attempting to delete an open file.
[05:57:34] <EmmaBonestell> I presumed setting O_SHARE_DELETE and/or O_CLOEXEC on the file descriptor used by Dynlink.loadfile would fix this issue on Windows.
[05:57:35] <EmmaBonestell> The Dynlink API doesn't appear to expose a file descriptor or other way to do this, so I thought I would shadow it; however, with a quick perusal of Dynlink's source code, I'm guessing this part of its code is handled in the C based (wrapper/implementation?) of libdl that, likewise, does not expose file descriptors.
[05:57:36] <EmmaBonestell> So... Ultimately, any suggestions on how I may fix this issue?

[12:39:16] <Anarchos> how to use ocamloptp in the following situation : i have a.ml and b.ml (no mli files) ; a.ml contains "include B". ocamloptp complains that  files a.p.cmx and b.p.cmx  make inconsistent assumptions over interface B'
[12:53:08] <octachron> I would propose to side-step the issue and use ppx_bisect rather than ocamloptp.
[12:58:07] <Anarchos> octachron i try to reactivate the profiling in dypgen. anyway i can try to change the include for open  ?
[13:02:29] <octachron> ppx_bisect is essentially a better version of ocamloptp (aka a version that doesn't require a separate executable, nor end up printing source file)
[13:03:11] <octachron> If you really want to use ocamloptp you should probably write down the missing mli files.
[13:05:36] <Anarchos> i tried but i have to erase and recreate them with Profiling module :/
[13:07:49] <octachron> No? The mli files should not refer to `Profiling` at all?
[13:10:21] <Anarchos> ok, let me build  the .mli files wiht ocamlc -i or ocamloptp -i ?
[13:10:29] <d_bot> <Drup> @octachron thanks for the fix in https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10952 ! I completely droped the ball on that one (some difficulties to follow github emails lately ...)
[13:11:35] <octachron> Anarchos, with ocamlc: you don't want to include the counters introduced by ocamlprof in the interfance.
[13:13:16] <d_bot> <octachron> @Drup no problem, that was mostly fixing code that I had written anyway. And which is only here as groundwork for printing signature difference.
[13:15:10] <d_bot> <Drup> yes, but still, it was a bit too radio-silence from my part ^^'

[19:09:29] <d_bot> <soilih> I hope you are well !
[19:09:31] <d_bot> <soilih> I have a big problem here on a project I'm working on. a performance issue that arose after recent changes I made. Does anyone know how to find where it came from?
