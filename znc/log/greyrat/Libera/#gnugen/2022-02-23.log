[10:31:20] <Orbstheorem> Does anybody know where this erosion may be coming from?
[10:31:33] <Orbstheorem> I don't think it's humidity cause it's only present where I rest my palms.
[10:32:08] <Orbstheorem> The later picture started just like the former.
[10:40:42] <sparrowhawk[m]> <Orbstheorem> "I don't think it's humidity..." <- Perspiration + friction from your hands ?
[10:42:55] <Orbstheorem> Probably, but what exactly?
[10:42:56] <afontain[m]> what sparrowhawk said I think
[10:43:38] <Orbstheorem> Cause I don't have the impression my hands are particularly humid (even if at a microscopic level there's always moisture).
[10:44:07] <Orbstheorem> Just normal wear and defective design?
[10:44:23] <afontain[m]> I think you always have a bit of water on your hands because it helps prehension
[10:44:54] <afontain[m]> Orbstheorem: I'd say yes, it should qualify as normal use I think
[10:47:13] * Orbstheorem is slightly annoyed cause he didn't have that problem in his previous computers.
[10:47:34] <Orbstheorem> (That said, my previous computers were plastic)
[11:44:17] <Anyone[m]> C'est bon si je passe entre 17h et 18h √† la GNU ?
[13:49:27] <typedef[m]> Moi j'ai une r√©union √† 17h, je sais pas exactement quand j'aurai fini :/
[13:59:24] <LaurentRoro[t][m> tous les thinkpad X ont ce probl√®me apparemment
[15:44:08] <Orbstheorem> :/
[15:47:20] <afontain[m]> Anyone: je peux √™tre l√†
[15:49:06] * Orbstheorem pense qu'on devrait accepter les payement des cotis via polybanking
[15:51:54] <Anyone[m]> afontain[m]: C'est bon je viens de passer finalement üëçüèº
[15:53:18] <Orbstheorem> Do you often have the problem that you don't know whether the context introduced by colons spans over multiple sentences?
[15:54:00] <Orbstheorem> e.g. Some statement: Some explaination for that statement. Maybe this phrase is a continuation of my argument for that statement.
[15:54:00] <afontain[m]> On s'est crois√© alors :)
[15:54:29] <Orbstheorem> (Also, how do you nest colons? :D)
[16:42:38] <Anyone[m]> <afontain[m]> "On s'est crois√© alors :)" <- Je crois bien oui !
[18:03:56] <sparrowhawk[m]> <Orbstheorem> "Do you often have the problem..." <- Nope, not if you write well. The colon context explicitly spans only the last part of the sentence (or until a semi-colon). If you need context longer than that, you use a linking word.
[18:04:33] <sparrowhawk[m]> *a fact: an explanation. This is out of `:` context*
[18:04:33] <sparrowhawk[m]> *a fact that requires long explanation! Therefore, sentence A. Also, sentence B.*
[18:04:59] <sparrowhawk[m]> And you don't nest colons: if you're trying to do that, your sentence is too long / ill-built
[18:15:10] <afontain[m]> J'ai typiquement eu tendance √† faire des phrases √† ralonge. Mais je me soigne :P
[18:16:00] <afontain[m]> le pire, c'est quand j'ai envie d'imbriquer des parenth√®ses :S
[18:16:31] <typedef[m]> Lisp
[18:24:13] <afontain[m]> je trouve ceci tr√®s drole: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Use_plain_English#Buzzwords
[21:29:29] <Notkea> <Orbstheorem> "e.g. _Some statement: Some..." <- I wonder whether this is better in Lojban
