[04:44:33] <mawk> ax²+bx looks like the start of the expansion of a[x + b/(2a)]²

[04:57:33] <zacts> good evening ##math
[05:00:25] <qergle> have any math for us?
[05:01:44] <shimbles> math is just a Domain Specific Language that didn't even use git
[05:02:08] <qergle> git outta here
[05:02:26] <zacts> qergle: I'm trying to latch onto this book of numbers by conway
[05:02:29] <shimbles> when Chomsky was writing math, he was like wut, is this even in my hierarchy or like, whatever? #AliG
[05:02:34] <zacts> trying to find something to tinker with
[05:02:52] <zacts> I disagree with chomsky on his Atoms of Language idea
[05:02:55] <qergle> zacts: i see. what does teh book of numbers cover?
[05:03:11] <zacts> qergle: difficult to describe, but it's kind of number theory-ish
[05:03:41] <qergle> so integers, then?
[05:03:51] <zacts> not only integers
[05:05:01] <zacts> knuth's concrete mathematics is probably more number theory than conway's book. conway's book is more playful, but still inspired I think by number theory.

[05:06:46] <cherim> You guessed my second most hated book!
[05:07:06] <qergle> conway is your 2nd most hated? what is your first?
[05:07:42] <cherim> We discussed "Winning ways for your mathematical plays" yesterday
[05:07:42] <shimbles> the first AI to treat mathematical syntax as a hyperparameter has joined
[05:07:56] <qergle> never heard of that book
[05:08:01] <zacts> ch2 is doing arithmetic and algebra by geometry
[05:08:08] <cherim> Berlekamp/Conway/Guy
[05:08:09] <zacts> it has lots of images there
[05:08:25] <zacts> ch3 is what comes next, moessner's magic
[05:08:37] <zacts> cherim: conway likes magic it seems :-P
[05:08:46] <cherim> Well, technically second place in hate hierarchy is for people who suggest TAOCP as a source for studying algorithms
[05:08:57] <cherim> But TAOCP is a good book, just on another topic
[05:09:03] <qergle> sipser, innit?
[05:09:17] <cherim> Concrete mathematics gets all the worst from Knuth's fixations though
[05:09:19] <zacts> cherim: you don't like concrete mathematics?
[05:09:42] <cherim> Yes, and in this area I am more qualified
[05:09:52] <cherim> So I am pretty sure in my marks
[05:10:05] <zacts> what do you dislike, and why?
[05:10:12] <zacts> I'm considering working thru knuth's book too
[05:10:35] <qergle> or am i thinking cormen

[05:33:31] <Z-module> If X is uniform in [-1, 1], then Y = X^999 is a bijection but no longer uniform on [-1, 1]. I probably don't understand the intended question.
[05:39:21] <evidlo> specifically I want to show that for m∈{0,1}^L and k~Unif({0,1})^L, the function xor(k, m) is still uniformly distributed

[05:41:49] <evidlo> its pretty easy to intuit just looking at the truth table, but does it generally hold true if xor is replaced with any bijection?
[05:42:33] <evidlo> or a bijection from {0,1}^L to {0,1}^L, more specifically
[05:45:13] *** Quits: zacts (~zacts@user/zacts) (Quit: Client closed)
[05:45:51] <evidlo> I guess xor isn't a bijection, but xor(·, m) is for any m.  Just trying to formalize what I understand intuitively
[05:46:49] <evidlo> my crypto class uses mostly plain language, so the proofs seem wordier than they need to be
[05:48:58] <buster> a discrete random variable with, say, N possible values is uniform iff the probability of each outcome is equal (to 1/N)
[05:50:09] <buster> it is true that permuting the values doesn't change that, yes. (intuitively, you could say you are only relabelling the outcomes.)
[05:50:55] <Z-module> yeah, my example before with Unif([-1,1]) was only possible because [-1,1] is uncountable.

[17:45:12] <rubiksdream> could someone help sanity check this for me ? ahlfors (complex analysis 2nd edition ), 'the outside of a circle is not simply connected for its complement consists of a closed disk and the point at infinity', here he is taking the complement with respect to C U {infinity}, its just a minor typo but the complement of the outside of the circle (confusing but here he actually means 'outside' - with respect to C, 'complement' - with respect to C U
[17:45:13] <rubiksdream> {infinity}) should be a circle and the point at infinity, right?
[17:45:43] <rubiksdream> greenbagels thats technically true, but i think complex analysis normally refers to 1-variable complex analysis

[18:06:03] <quantum> If the circle is the set `{ z\in \hat{C} : |z| = 1}` is the outside the set `{z\in \hat{C} : |z| > 1}`?
[18:06:15] <rubiksdream> quantum it would, he is using the word 'outside of SET ' to mean C \ SET , for all SET \subset C, and 'complement of SET' to mean (C U {infinity}) \ SET , for all SET \subset C
[18:06:21] <riv> If you contain infinity then it is simply connected
[18:06:32] <riv> because you can homotopy the path around the circle
[18:06:32] <quantum> ^^
[18:06:37] <rubiksdream> so using his convention, 'outside of SET' cannot contain the point at infinity
[18:06:54] <riv> the outside of the circle wrt. the complex plane is not simply connected though,
[18:07:58] <rubiksdream> yes, he is trying to emphasize 'a plane set is simply connected iff its complement with respect to the extended plane is connected', the outside of the circle has complement {infinity} U {circle} , which is disconnected, therefore the outside of the circle is not simply connected
[18:08:08] <quantum> I think that was the point
[18:08:45] <rubiksdream> i was asking if the outside of the circle has complement (w.r.t C U {infinity}) , {infinity} U {circle}, rather than {infinity} U {closed disk} , the latter is what ahlfors writes, and I believe to be a minor error
[18:09:21] <quantum> well if outside means complement wrto the plane, then yes
[18:09:35] <rubiksdream> yes, according to ahlfors that is what he means by that
[18:10:22] <quantum> since the outside of the circle is the set `{z\in C\subset \hat{C} : |z| > 1} U {z\in C\subset \hat{C} : |z| < 1}`
[18:11:11] <quantum> and the complement of that is the point at infinity U the unit circle itself
[18:11:44] <Z-module> rubiksdream: that sure is confusing. If K is some circle in the plane C, then the set C\K has two components where the "outside" one is the unbounded one, and this set by itself is non-simply-connected, but on the sphere C cup {infty}, the complement of K has two compondents that are both contractible (so simply connected).

[18:13:52] <Z-module> oh, I'm now beginning to think Ahlfors is doing that horrible/wrong terminology, using "circle" to mean disk. Ugh.
[18:14:54] <Z-module> Yeah, removing a disk from C leaves behind a set with pi_1 Z, b ut removing a disk from S^2 leaves behind a contractible set.
[18:14:55] <quantum> pain
[18:15:19] <Z-module> (as you can demonstrate with a balloon and a pin)
[18:15:30] <rubiksdream> he can't be, he establishes disk means the usual thing in the start of the book, the confusion is certainly because the words 'outside' and 'complement' mean different things, but it is also because the object in consideration from the very beginning is not K (the unit circle), but C \ K , C \ K refers to the 'outside of the circle', and he is looking at (C U {infinity} ) \ (C \ K)
[18:16:55] <riv> i wouldn't worry about it too much
[18:16:56] <quantum> So as a function, the outside is given by `S \mapsto (\hat{C} \ S) \ {∞}`?
[18:17:16] <riv> you spotted the error, so you understand this material well
[18:17:44] <rubiksdream> yeah, sorry for this mess lol, i didnt mean to drag you guys into this awful use of terminology
[18:19:54] <rubiksdream> i also misspoke, the condition he is really talking about is for regions, not just 'plane sets', i.e. we only care about simple connectivity of connected open subsets of C
[18:21:02] <rubiksdream> sorry, *open subsets of C (since he is talking about applying this criterion to the 'outside of a circle' = C \ K, so he can't mean region = connected + open )
[18:22:12] <johnkeats7> is this all to argue the outside of a disk isn't simply connected?
[18:22:13] <Z-module> Surely he's not allowing a disconnected set to be called simply connected?
[18:22:55] <rubiksdream> ah yeah he isn't, he does define region as connected + open, see im confused because then i do not know why he is applying a criterion he claims should only be applied to 'connected open sets' , to the 'outside of a circle' (a clearly non-connected set)
[18:23:03] <Z-module> johnkeats -- what fabulous new features did version 7 introduce?
[18:23:18] <rubiksdream> johnkeats7 outside of a circle
[18:23:30] <rubiksdream> where by circle he really means boundary(D^1)
[18:23:40] <Z-module> rubiksdream: there's no chance he didn't say circle when he meant disk?
[18:24:04] <Z-module> (rather, no chance he said)
[18:24:15] <rubiksdream> he refers to 'open disks' as |z-p| < r (center p, radius r), thats why I said it seems unlikely
[18:24:24] <rubiksdream> but honestly who knows, at this point i'm just flogging a dead horse
[18:24:27] <rubiksdream> ill read on haha

[18:34:23] <rubiksdream> what part of alg. top was used mostly?
[18:34:48] <quantum> singular/simplicial homology mostly
[18:35:08] <rubiksdream> ah okay, interesting
[18:35:10] <mornfall> rubiksdream: ‘the outside of a circle is not simply connected, for its complement consists of a closed disk and the point at infinity’ … is this the problematic sentence? but if the complement of the ‘outside of the circle’ is a disk + infinity, then that disk is clearly the inside of the circle, no? it seems to make sense to me
[18:35:15] <greenbagels> rubiksdream: i had a similar but maybe opposite question; i spent a while after my semester in undergrad CA asking people if there was any significant motivation to study several complex variables
[18:35:51] <greenbagels> one professor (my former CA / abstract algebra professor) basically say "some people want to study it just to study it" or something along those lines
[18:36:00] <mornfall> rubiksdream: (and in particular, ‘outside’ definitely does _not_ mean ‘complement’)
[18:36:05] <Plazma> quantum: muh integerals over all the curves, even if they're linear
[18:36:07] <rubiksdream> mornfall yeah it was problematic because i incorrectly assumed (for some silly reason or another) that 'outside = complement w.r.t C' , rather than 'unbounded component of complement'
[18:36:13] <Plazma> evrerything is an integral, no further questions
[18:36:14] <rubiksdream> after what you said, it makes total sense

[18:38:23] <rubiksdream> greenbagels i guess because in some sense its 'neat', like a germ of a holomorphic function is really just a power series, or if you like the coefficients of its power series, whereas when you leave the world of complex variables you can still define germs but can't think of them as coefficients of (convergent) power series anymore
[18:38:38] <rubiksdream> i feel like the analytic = C^{infinity} thing is the most compelling part of it
[18:39:09] <greenbagels> right; but i meant like, the motivation to move from R -> R^n in some sense feels more natural to me than trying to justify i need something beyond C
[18:39:42] <greenbagels> but i think that's just a coincidence with how R and R^n align with very surface level (and beyond) physical science and stuff
[18:40:02] <greenbagels> because from a math perspective, it's very natural to take something like C and go "how does the picture change in C^n" or whatever
[18:40:03] <rubiksdream> yeah, i guess another important thing if you like physics is the link between harmonic functions and holomorphic ones
[18:40:17] <greenbagels> yeah i should review harmonic functions

[20:59:54] <dude12312414> if you had already proven uniqueness of inverses before
[21:00:01] <dude12312414> you could also do something like
[21:00:25] <dude12312414> -(-x) + (-x) = 0 (definition of -)
[21:00:50] <dude12312414> hm
[21:01:05] <dude12312414> actually i was going to say something that doesn't work
[21:01:31] <dude12312414> well
[21:01:35] <dude12312414> you know x + (-x) = 0 by definition of - too
[21:02:02] <dude12312414> so x is the (unique) inverse of (-x)
[21:02:03] <Z-module> Guest42, in fact the result is true in all groups including non-abelian ones, but for those you need a different notation.

[22:14:16] <Guest2> Yes. That's the basis of my proof. I can't find that explicitly anywhere.
[22:14:41] <riv> so what you need to look for is the definition of the natural numbers
[22:15:04] <riv> they can be defined in different ways, but they're all equivalent and what you end up with is:
[22:15:38] <riv> A set N that has some '0' zero in it, and some 'S' such that for any n in N, S(n) is in N
[22:15:46] <riv> with the ability to perform mathematical induction on these
[22:16:10] <riv> you also need a definition of <=, this can be defined by induction
[22:16:51] <riv> inductively you would define <= such that 0 <= n  always holds, S(m) <= 0 does not hold, S(m) <= S(n) holds iff m <= n holds
