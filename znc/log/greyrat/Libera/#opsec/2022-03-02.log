[21:45:17] <Joanna> lts-: interesting. I’m glad I don’t use things that require phone numbers. Once you give someone a phone number they can find your physical location and more. I don’t mind the idea of limiting accounts to one per device using unique serial number though. Is there any message service that does that?
[21:46:37] <jan6> why don't you use a bouncer or something, Joanna 
[21:47:04] <jan6> it's annoying how you miss pretty much all the links I post, because you're only offline during those times
[21:47:12] <lts-> ^ 
[21:48:15] <jan6> (not to mention then talk about a topic which for everyone else, happened like half a day ago, and is probably somewhere deep in the history)
[21:49:33] <Joanna> Has anyone ever heard of routers sending out signals against the wishes of their owners for mapping ip addresses for geolocation? I was once told about it but I don’t remember what brand the router was. It could not be turned off and was sending out a strong signal and he had to put it in a faraday cage until he got a new router..
[21:50:50] <jan6> never heard of that, because it's stupid, wifi point geolocation happens by walking and driving around, and charting up what access points are visible at what points, not some magic signal that only some routers emit, secretly
[21:53:16] <jan6> you then can narrow the location based on how strong they are at various points, and use the wifi points themselves to triangulate an approximate location, when gps and mobile networks are unavailable or too lossy
[21:54:39] <Joanna> Having WiFi that can be turned off would not allow up address geolocation
[21:54:57] <jan6> totally would, and it already can be turned off
[21:54:58] <jan6> lol
[21:57:00] <jan6> option 1) go to router settings, and disable wifi, option 2) just physically cut off (unscrew, or something) the wifi antennas, it will be too weak to go anywhere, I'm pretty sure, or option 3) use separate devices, like a sane person, AKA router routes, and is physically separate from wifi point, letting you simply cut power to the wifi point
[21:57:10] <Joanna> I don’t remember the details but he said the router had some extra internal antennas and was sending out very strong signals that were stronger than the WiFi signal
[21:57:38] <Joanna> Does google make routers?
[21:57:43] <jan6> if it had internal antennas stronger than wifi external ones, that would be some groundbreaking technology, lol
[21:58:05] <jan6> depends how you define "google" and "router", but probably, a little bit
[21:58:54] <jan6> pretty much any networked device could be made to act as a router, any phone can act as a router in order to share network connection via tethering or wifi access point, for example
[21:59:14] <Joanna> Modern cell phones don’t have big long antennas anymore they use the metal case as the antenna. So it’s possible
[21:59:40] <jan6> assuming you've got one of the fancy pantsy phones with metal case
[21:59:46] <jan6> which very few people have
[21:59:47] <jan6> lol
[22:00:15] <jan6> usually it's neither, it's taped on squiggly antennas on the inside
[22:00:30] <Joanna> A lot of people do
[22:00:55] <jan6> "a lot" is very relative
[22:01:41] <jan6> "a lot" of people have iphones too, but globally, of all people, not that many do
[22:01:46] <jan6> etc
[22:02:07] <jan6> also metal cases won't actually even make for good antennas, lol
[22:02:15] <Joanna> This particular person also thought that people were remotely monitoring his brain and then eventually wouldn’t respond to private messages and disappeared from irc..
[22:02:29] <jan6> there's a LOT of stuff involved in radio stuffs
[22:03:38] <Joanna> I’ve met a lot of strange people in irc..
[22:03:40] <jan6> sounds about right for such a paranoid nut, radio waves themselves can't monitor his brain, unless hes a cyborg, they'd need something to recieve the waves, and very little interference, and clear signal all the way through, etc etc
[22:04:28] <jan6> radio stuffs are REALLY involved, tbh
[22:04:37] <Joanna> I don’t know if it was true or not I don’t like to dismiss people like that.
[22:05:04] <jan6> oftentimes, you need specific antenna designs, just "using the case" is usually a lot worse than using actual antennas
[22:05:50] <jan6> like there's a reason why there's no "external antenna clip", which you could attach to some sink or something, to suddenly get ultra-good reception with your phone or radio, lol
[22:10:37] <jan6> I've "dismissed" you, too, anyway, doesn't mean I'll stop talking to you, though ;P (would be your loss, anyway)

[22:12:53] <jan6> since you seem to use irccloud, but not even use it properly, for the always-online service, which is like most of the entire point of using their service (or self-host a bouncer of some sort, or have a friend do that for you, or something, if you think you care about your data)
[22:13:55] <Joanna> I can see your messages even from when I’m not around . You worry too much
[22:14:15] <jan6> did you see all those links?
[22:15:17] <jan6> and did you see emailselfdefense.fsf.org yesterday or so, posted before you joined?
[22:16:25] <jan6> if you're not online, you don't get new messages, which means that either 1) you see old messages replayed, and think they're new, or 2) you're secretly part of a benevolent botnet, of other people sharing chat history with you, and you sharing chat history with them
[22:16:42] <jan6> it's one of the 2, simply because of how IRC works
[22:17:50] <jan6> there is no "history mode" on this channel, or this server, as a matter of fact, so you physically CANNOT recieve chat messages from the server, unless you were here during the sending of them
[22:20:22] <jan6> so I don't worry too much
[22:22:38] <jan6> it's either of the 2 options I outlined, simply because of the limitations of irc protocol making any other explanation impossible, and if it's #2, then the leader of opsec channel doing that, makes me wonder why I even am at a place nobody actually knows or bothers to deal with actual opsec, despite the channel name
[22:22:39] <jan6> lol
[22:23:23] <Joanna> It’s hard to get people to talk
[22:24:02] <jan6> there's SEVENTY THREE people here, of which like maybe 5 or so ocassionally talk
[22:24:09] <jan6> maybe 10, if being generous
[22:24:44] <jan6> of THAT many people not speaking, is something more than just "hard to get them to talk"
[22:25:23] <jan6> there's a LOT of channels, often with much fewer members, which are WAY more active and chatty

[22:30:08] <jan6> it's rarely anything specific
[22:30:29] <jan6> prolly most forgot they're here, or are just lurking, anyway
[22:30:56] <jan6> but you can send out massive walls of ping, mentioning every user, and ask why they're silent, and not chatting ;P
[22:32:04] <jan6> if they don't answer within 2 days, they're probably bots or inattentive old lurking accounts, and if they do, then hey, at least they told you (and you can ask what you could improve to get them to give their thoughts, too)
[22:32:17] <Joanna> Too much work..
[22:32:33] <Joanna> And sometimes people resent that
[22:34:11] <jan6> RIP bandcamp, https://twitter.com/jephjacques/status/1499069668841213953
[22:35:18] <jan6> sometimes people resent lurkers, too, what about those people, Joanna ;P
[22:37:27] <Joanna> I don’t mind lurkers they make good decoration
[22:39:21] <jan6> they make bad decoration, since they're invisible
[22:39:37] <jan6> all they do is decorate the entire screen with joins and leaves, over time
[22:40:12] <Joanna> The member list looks nice
[22:41:16] <Joanna> They are probably harvesting our chats and using them for who knows what

[23:53:10] <Joanna> Hi JimBuntu I wondered where you went. What is your take on Ukraine drama?
