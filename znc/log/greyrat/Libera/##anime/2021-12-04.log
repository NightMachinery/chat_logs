[01:36:18] <DPA> I'm currently trying to put together a list of the names of the best animes I've seen. I noticed I have forgotten to add some animes I have seen to my list of all animes I've seen. Maybe someone can help me find them, I don't remember their names.
[01:36:18] <DPA> One of them made one of the characters electro shock the protagonest with some weiered gun, and I think there was something about who can see who, and there was something with a lake, and I think the protagonist was sort of dead already sort of not.
[01:36:18] <DPA> The other one was something with tuning into different universes per radio, there are different version of them, and something destroys some of the worlds.
[01:38:26] <Cryowolf> electroshocks with some weird gun, who can see w ho, a lake and protagonist already dead? THat sounds odd
[01:39:09] <Cryowolf> you sure youre talking anime here? 
[01:39:11] <Cryowolf> ^^
[01:40:16] <DPA> Yes, I'm absolutely sure I saw something like that.
[01:40:17] <Fenderbassist> doing a web search for electro shock gun anime, I get Occultic Nine, haven't seen it so I can't verify
[01:40:35] <Cryowolf> I remember one about  a kid looking for his dad across different realities
[01:40:42] <Cryowolf> using a crystal of some sort
[01:40:57] <DPA> I saw Occultic Nine, but it's not the one I was thinking of.
[01:41:08] <Fenderbassist> ok, I gave it a shot (no pun intended)
[01:43:07] <Cryowolf> as for the shock thing
[01:43:11] <Cryowolf> Darker than Black?
[01:44:00] <DPA> I don't think so. There are no lakes involved, are there?
[01:44:12] <DPA> I found the second one "Akanesasu Shoujo". It was in the list after all, I just missed it. Now, I just need to remember the first one.
[01:44:23] <Cryowolf> in the sequel there is
[01:44:52] <Cryowolf> the eletroshock, is it torture? a ight?
[01:44:54] <Cryowolf> fight*
[01:45:37] <Cryowolf> cause a lot of these have fights on lakes
[01:45:58] <DPA> I didn't know there was a sequel. I need to watch that.
[01:45:58] <DPA> The eletroshock is more of a gimmick, it charges the protagonist up. There was also something about the names of the people found in the lake.
[01:46:16] <DPA> Which the protagonist was one of.
[01:46:18] <Cryowolf> Hunter X Hunter?
[01:46:32] <Cryowolf> found in the lake?
[01:46:34] <Cryowolf> dead?
[01:46:49] <Cryowolf> but that's the plot of occult;nine isn't it? :P

[01:55:09] <Cryowolf> There is Boku dake ga Inai Machi (Erased) but thats not the one I meant. It's still a very good one though
[02:05:07] <Cryowolf> gah now this is bothering me
[02:05:57] <Cryowolf> this anime about a guy who I forget either time trafvels or rewinds time. In the future he's accompanied by a short girl that has comedic timing on clumsiness. At one point she warns him not to trip on a hole in the sidewalk, prodeedingn to trip in it herself

[02:25:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Ever tried to communicate securely through a QEMU VM?
[02:25:41] <ButterNoodle> *define secure
[02:25:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> QEMU filesystem share is insecure and actively dangerous.
[02:26:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So that's not an option.
[02:26:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (Its intended use-case is for internal trusted environments)
[02:26:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Xen has VCHANs that can be used for arbitrary messages.
[02:27:21] <ButterNoodle> true.. for anything needing real security for host-guest file transfer... what kinda communication?
[02:27:28] * gh0s1 jumps in convo
[02:27:28] <ButterNoodle> just a bus?
[02:27:35] <ButterNoodle> or network?
[02:27:38] <ButterNoodle> or file transfer
[02:27:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Network isn't an option in this case.
[02:27:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Because SLIRP-mode is used.
[02:27:55] <ButterNoodle> ahhh so isolated guest
[02:27:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yup.
[02:28:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Isolated guest that needs to provision stuff at runtime.
[02:28:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's an edge-case.
[02:28:21] <ButterNoodle> well u already have serial?
[02:28:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Eh... sort-of but that brings the question: How do you ensure a specific serial device name inside the VM?
[02:29:15] <ButterNoodle> udev to the rescue!

[02:30:29] <ButterNoodle> wouldnt it be more secure if u just loaded the qcow on a microsd and encased it in amber?
[02:30:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Orchestrator-provisioned multiple instances of a read-only VM which dynamically provisioned communication keys.
[02:30:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But using the same keys for every VM would fuck with the routing of the communication layer.

[02:31:10] <ButterNoodle> very underrated Cryowolf..
[02:31:34] <Cryowolf> nice
[02:31:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So it has to be provisioned at runtime (first-boot).
[02:31:45] <ButterNoodle> Aurora_v_kosmose: ic.. so ur wanting to run commands on pre-provisioned vms prior to deployment/prod
[02:31:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yup.

[02:32:01] <gh0s1> kill
[02:32:03] <gh0s1> me
[02:32:05] <gh0s1> now
[02:32:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> In the end I found a simpler way: my orchestrator supports pre-start lifecycle tasks where I can generate the initialization data as a cdrom to attach to the VMs.
[02:32:44] <ButterNoodle> almost be ez-er to leverage the host to mount the qcow and make mods.. but in an enterprise thats probably not gonna fly
[02:32:49] <ButterNoodle> gh0s1: ALL Fs
[02:33:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's actually for my own stuff.
[02:33:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Work pretty much goes "lolcontainersgo"
[02:33:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But I find containers to have insufficient isolation guarantees.
[02:33:30] <ButterNoodle> so a boot process that will load a bootable media that will make the mods- restart and boot os?
[02:34:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: VMs built with Packer, pre-provisioned by Ansible, and then runtime-provisioned by cloud-init.
[02:34:40] <ButterNoodle> u got one more automation tool u can throw at it :)

[02:35:42] <ButterNoodle> is minimal
[02:36:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Packer's job is mostly sending the boot commands over VNC to the VM. Debian preseed/Fedora kickstart does 90% of the job. Then you have Packer ssh into the VM, scp playbook files & run Ansible on them.
[02:36:53] <ButterNoodle> ansible is amazing tho..
[02:37:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The main part that's not easily replicated by a shellscript with Packer is the VNC part.

[02:45:18] <ButterNoodle> gotcha... but to the ipv6 discussion u really only need to know about the prefix on the /64
[02:45:38] <ButterNoodle> its seriously reminds me of IPX routing with extra sauce
[02:45:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They changed a shitload with regards to multicast.
[02:45:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> DHCP & the rest too.
[02:45:59] <ButterNoodle> IPX was real ez, the nic's mac was the address by default

[02:46:09] <ButterNoodle> yeea I hate the auto provision shit
[02:47:08] <ButterNoodle> too many fucking protocols and chatter.. just open port 67/68 and say fuckit on v4
[02:47:25] <ButterNoodle> and they integrate ipv6-icmp and shit in there to
[02:47:47] <ButterNoodle> v6 is supposed to save the world with multicast /s
[02:47:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: On the ICMP aspect I prefer IPv6 because security wasn't a complete after-thought.
[02:48:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> IPv6 basically needs all ICMP allowed, end of the story.
[02:48:15] <ButterNoodle> I hate that
[02:48:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> IPv4 requires reading up the docs on the different calls and deciding if you want to risk them or not.
[02:48:34] <ButterNoodle> ig the alternative is static addressing
[02:48:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ICMP has to do with link/route negociation and quality.

[06:59:23] <ButterNoodle> ?

[08:07:09] <MootPoot> I have linux question
[08:07:10] <gregorbze> why is ipv6 adoption so low?
[08:07:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: owo?

[08:07:16] <MootPoot> yet
[08:07:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> gregorbze: ISPs suck.
[08:07:19] <MootPoot> NAT is a thing
[08:07:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: On the contrary. More than enough need, ISP NATs are a thing and it's horribly.
[08:07:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Forget self-hosting with that shit.
[08:07:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Which is utterly unacceptable.
[08:07:54] <MootPoot> really
[08:07:55] <gregorbze> NATs are horrible
[08:08:01] <MootPoot> I thought NAT just solved the problem
[08:08:05] <MootPoot> with big enough bandaid
[08:08:15] <gregorbze> theres 7 billion people and less than 4 billion IPs
[08:08:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It solves the problem if you're purely a consumer and use no p2p whatsoever.
[08:08:28] <gregorbze> *usable IPs
[08:08:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It otherwise breaks everything.
[08:08:41] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: I want to install Wikit on my rpi. Problem is the repo version is made for x86
[08:08:45] <amigojapan> gregorbze: I think it is partly cause ipv4 had more human readable addresses
[08:08:53] <ButterNoodle> ipv6 is a meme
[08:08:59] <MootPoot> ipv69
[08:09:03] <ButterNoodle> yes
[08:09:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Well. There's binfmt & qemu.
[08:09:21] <MootPoot> ok.
[08:09:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Or you could build it for ARM, if it builds.
[08:09:27] <gregorbze> how many usable ipv4 are there? pretty sure it's less than half of the address space
[08:09:28] <MootPoot> are those additional commands?
[08:09:31] <ButterNoodle> CGNAT truly is an abomination Aurora_v_kosmose 
[08:10:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Basically binfmt-support and qemu will result in transparent emulation/translation of CPU instructions for binaries meant for another architecture.
[08:10:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That comes at the cost of performance.
[08:10:24] <MootPoot> okay
[08:10:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Hence why I suggest to check if it can be compiled for native ARM instructions first instead.
[08:10:34] <MootPoot> so the ideal is to compile it myself
[08:10:37] <MootPoot> okay
[08:10:41] * MootPoot googles
[08:10:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But in the case where it might not be able, the QEMU option is there to use it anyway.

[08:31:30] <amigojapan> Ok
[08:31:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> apt-{get,cache,...} are the oldschool interfaces.
[08:32:29] <amigojapan> MootPoot: it's more clear is you say synaptic and apt-get, both handle the same packages

[08:33:32] <amigojapan> MootPoot: but you can only get a lock on the packages one package manager at a time
[08:34:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Synaptic is a GUI that calls into the same backends Apt does, although it does not necessarily do it with the same args, options and all.
[08:34:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Mind, it may have been since refactored into using Apt in the background.

[09:29:12] <Sadale> MootPoot, That's how it works for weekend lunches.
[09:29:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: You can see more details in the manpage for sources.list
[09:29:54] <MootPoot> Damn ButterNoodle, missed a block there
[09:30:37] <MootPoot> Sadale: kombini
[09:31:03] <Sadale> MootPoot, I had fastfood today
[09:31:09] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: how do you.... Do those things when running in a cli only system
[09:31:12] <MootPoot> Like
[09:31:37] <MootPoot> I have my windows system that I just pull a browser up on
[09:31:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> > The URI for the deb type must specify the base of the Debian distribution, | That should bolded in the manpage in the general format explanation part.
[09:31:52] <MootPoot> But if you're in terminal only 
[09:32:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Hm? Well, first I'd install tmux so I can have multiple terminals in a single tty.
[09:32:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> tmux also supports reattaching to a running session, if you're running it over ssh and the network hiccups or something
[09:32:36] <MootPoot> How do you go "lemme Google this problem" or let's go to the manpage
[09:32:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (or you have a slow task and intentionally detach from it for a while)
[09:33:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Right, so, a very useful package in debian is called mandb. I think it's installed by default.
[09:33:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It allows you to go "apropos $topic" in the terminal and get relevant manpages.
[09:33:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Stuff like interfaces(5) or sources.list(5) are old GNU/Linux standbys and of course have manpages.
[09:33:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You can specify the manpage section to fetch the manpage in like: man 5 interfaces
[09:34:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If you don't specify I think it just iterates from 1 to 8 and picks the first it finds.
[09:35:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You can also use: find /usr/share/man/man{1..8} -type f | less
[09:35:29] *** Quits: tafami (~tafami_@103.225.136.98) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[09:35:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That will show you all installed manpages.
[09:35:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Type "h" in less to see a builtin help page for navigation commands. "/" is to be used for searching text in the buffer.
[09:35:59] <MootPoot> So does every package or every thing on your PATH have a manpage?
[09:36:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Not every, as some packages don't have one for some reason or another (often because the author made none and no one else bothered).
[09:36:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But the vast majority of them do have a manpage.
[09:36:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> GNU projects have a very minimal manpage, most of the time, as GNU packages instead prefer the info manuals
[09:37:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You can install the "info" package, so you get an info browser that shows all the manuals you have installed.
[09:37:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Emacs also comes with equivalent (and better) functionality built-in.

[09:40:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There's a readme with its sourcecode I think?
[09:41:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Right, another useful package is "apt-file" which needs installing and redownloading the update index.
[09:41:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You can then go apt-file list $somepackage | grep /usr/share/doc
[09:42:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That'll tell you if a given package has docs non-manpage docs.
[09:42:00] *** Joins: tafami (~tafami_@103.225.136.98)

[09:43:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Absolutely.
[09:43:47] <amigojapan> Ah good
[09:44:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: It explains someo of the man program's commands, and also references to other man section docuemntation for man.
[09:44:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Such as man 7 man
[09:44:07] <MootPoot> Is there a man for woman
[09:44:17] <MootPoot> 8man
[09:44:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: No, that's an Emacs Lisp package.
[09:44:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It does have an info manual.
[09:44:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's used for reading manpages in Emacs on systems that do not have "man" installed.
[09:44:58] <MootPoot> I feel like that's a joke but I can't tell
[09:45:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Naming it WoMan (Without Man) was definitely a joke.
[09:45:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But it does exist and it's useful too.

[13:15:42] <Nanobot> Retracing. Meaning, the price made a significant movement (a notable low point to a notable high point, or vice versa) and the price is now traveling the opposite direction. It's "retracing" that first movement. When the price is moving sideways, it's common to retrace about 61.8% - 78.6% before reversing again and retracing about 61.8% - 78.6% of THAT movement. It's common enough that you can trade on it and statistically come out with a small profit as

[13:18:11] <Nanobot> Some people also refer to the 61.8% - 78.6% range as the "OTE zone" (optimal trade entry or optimal trade exit). It's where you're likely to have the strongest support/resistance, and thus tends to make a good price range for buying/selling if you're looking to get in/out.
[13:20:29] <Sadale> hmm.
[13:21:03] <Sadale> Nanobot, do you have another example other than the 2021-06-21, 2021-11-09 pair?
[13:21:32] <Sadale> I'm trying to find another pair for performing this analysis. But the price apparently just kept rising before 2021-06-21. :/
[13:21:49] <Nanobot> Keep in mind that there are usually multiple OTE zones in play at any given time. Earlier today, there were three major ones: one starting on 2021-09-20, one starting on 2021-06-21, and one starting on 2020-03-12, all ending at the all-time high. The first of those zones got destroyed today when the price dropped below it.
[13:23:17] <Nanobot> Those are all OTE long zones. There isn't an OTE short zone right now, at least on the 1w and 1d charts, because we're currently dropping from the all-time high.

[13:26:32] <Sadale> Nanobot, oh never mind. I get why it's 2021-09-20. That's because you're using 1w timescale.
[13:26:41] <Nanobot> I'm guessing you're looking at the 1w chart. The date it shows is the start of that week. If you look at the 1d chart, the lowest point was on 2021-09-21. (at least in my time zone)

[13:29:59] <Sadale> Nanobot, oh. So the OTE long zone for 2021-01-18 would end with 2021-04-05, right?
[13:30:04] <Nanobot> If the price goes below the 78.6%, the OTE zone dies
[13:30:23] <Sadale> ah. It dies.
[13:30:36] <Nanobot> Yeah, there was an OTE long zone there at one point.
[13:30:48] <Sadale> I see. And this OTE long zone ended up dying.
[13:31:05] <Sadale> Nanobot, so, what do you do after it dies? Is that a buy signal?
[13:31:33] <Sadale> Nanobot, or do you wait for the end of OTE short zone until you make a buy?
[13:32:05] <Nanobot> If an OTE long zone dies, that means the market is bearish. It isn't a buy signal nor a sell signal, it's more like an "I've already missed a sell opportunity" signal.

[14:19:59] <Nanobot> JesseDesu: What I was saying earlier... Miners make their money from the block reward (which is a set amount of Bitcoins that gets cut in half about every 4 years) and transaction fees (which are variable, but tend to be higher when there's more network congestion). So, (reward + fees) * BTC price = income. Subtract operational costs and the variable energy costs, and that gives you the net profit for the mining ecosystem overall. Miners compete with each 
[14:20:00] <Nanobot> other by spending more energy to get a larger slice of the profit pie, but this means lower profit margins for the ecosystem. With enough competition, the profit margins will theoretically shrink to the opportunity costs (the value at which it is no more profitable than other things they could be spending their efforts on). If the operational costs go up (because the signature validation requires more computational work), then something else in the 
[14:20:00] <Nanobot> equation has to adjust to compensate. That means less energy spent on mining, because that's the only variable the miners can adjust.
[14:21:58] <Nanobot> If less energy is being spent on mining, the bitcoin protocol will adjust the difficulty downward in order to maintain an average rate of one block per 10 minutes.

[14:29:58] <Nanobot> Quantum computers have only a small impact on symmetric cryptography (basically, you just need to double your key sizes, and you're good to go). The main thing quantum computers negatively affect is *asymmetric* cryptography. Specifically, prime factorization and the discrete log problem, which underpin all widely-used asymmetric cryptography today. Asymmetric cryptography is used for things like digital signatures. Bitcoin uses digital signatures in 
[14:29:59] <Nanobot> order to prove that you control the addresses you're sending bitcoins from. There are other approaches to digital signature algorithms that are quantum resistant, but they're much less efficient than what Bitcoin is currently using. If/when quantum computers reach the point where they can perform practical attacks, Bitcoin can switch to quantum-resistant algorithms. It just isn't worth doing yet.

[14:33:38] <JesseDesu> what if god is in a superposition in both states of existing and not existing
[14:34:35] <amigojapan> JesseDesu: then he will collapse when observed, maybe that is why he hides
[14:35:10] <JesseDesu> exactly
[14:35:11] <JesseDesu> sorta
[14:35:40] <Nanobot> Hypothetically, let's say there's a quantum computer that can easily break today's digital signature algorithms. Here's what that means in practice for Bitcoin: If someone sends bitcoins to your newly-created address, those bitcoins are perfectly safe. The quantum computers can't do anything harmful to you. But, once you attempt to send bitcoins *out* of your address, your public key becomes visible. A quantum computer can look at your public key and 
[14:35:40] <Nanobot> figure out the corresponding private key, at which point it will be able to forge your signature, to authorize sending those bitcoins somewhere else instead. At this point, there are two competing and contradictory transactions out there on the network, racing to be finalized. Since it's a race, the attacker has a very limited amount of time to see your public key, derive the private, and send a transaction with a forged signature. If it takes more than 
[14:35:41] <Nanobot> an hour to do that, the attack will almost certainly fail, because your transaction will have already been finalized by then.
[14:36:49] *** Joins: rvalue (~rvalue@user/rvalue)
[14:37:36] <JesseDesu> if god wants your bitcoins he will take it
[14:38:00] <JesseDesu> using a 9000qubit quantum computer the size of uranus
[14:38:18] <Nanobot> Quantum computers do pose more of a threat to the lightning network, though, were transactions might go unfinalized for days, weeks, months, or even longer.
[14:38:20] <JesseDesu> i dont even know what that means
[14:38:38] <Nanobot> But, again, the solution is to just adopt a new digital signature algorithm.
[14:38:42] <JesseDesu> whats a liightning network
[14:39:31] <JesseDesu> nanobot, theres an arms race with computers
[14:39:49] <JesseDesu> computers are the new guns
[14:39:58] <Nanobot> The lightning network is a layer built on top of Bitcoin which basically solves Bitcoin's scalability issues. It essentially allows nearly-instant payments for much lower fees and much more frequent transaction activity. What ends up getting written to the Bitcoin blockchain is the *net* result of all that transaction activity, instead of each individual transaction.
[14:40:17] <JesseDesu> when someone puts more armor, someone invents a bigger gun
[14:40:38] <Nanobot> I need to get to bed. It's past 3am.

[16:25:00] <Artemis3> I was watching the truck kun isekai too, but decided to read it and... well it was so so
[16:25:29] <Artemis3> re zero is good, but long... konosuba i read the whole ln anime is too short
[16:26:08] <Artemis3> really mushoku tensei built an interesting world but... oh whatever don't want to spoil
[16:26:25] <amigojapan> Artemis3: I only thought the whale hunt was too long
[16:26:51] <Artemis3> the way it ends is dissappointing (the novel, the anime i doubt will ever reach that, tho i stopped watching, should check where it stops)
[16:26:56] <amigojapan> Artemis3: I could not stand slime
[16:27:15] <Artemis3> oh that was a fun read, wn is better than ln, ln is what the anime is based on
[16:27:33] <Artemis3> but its pretty shonen, fights galore
[16:28:02] <Artemis3> there is another slime isekai, but its a guy that breeds tons of them

[16:33:42] <pretender2> Manga?
[16:33:59] <Artemis3> and speaking of those, the Korean novel has a bunch of them... name is Dungeon Attack, to read the LN skip to the WN, it has ecchi content you are warned. I guess not to the extreme of the Dungeon Keeper one (forgot its name)

[16:35:05] <pretender2> Haha manwha and manhua, they have a lot of series about isekai
[16:35:26] <pretender2> Artemis3: the smartphone one
[16:35:40] <Artemis3> see most of them start life as web novel, then sometimes a publisher gets interested and if they sign a contract, the author kinda redoit again for the publisher, they often change things completely (like an adaptation)

[16:37:23] <amigojapan> I only watched the first episode of sword art online
[16:37:40] <Artemis3> So modern situation, a nobody writes a web novel (there is some site for japan, another for korea, china, etc.) fan translations appear in novelupdates... Ok then maybe they rank very high, a publisher approaches, if that sells a lot, the anime studio also approaches, you get adaptation from adaptation from adaptation. Sometimes even a manga is adapted too
[16:37:52] <amigojapan> It seems to be an anime you either love it hate

[16:52:21] <Artemis3> Hmm not that i remember there is a vampire in that type moon game... the anime covers one route only?

[17:05:05] <Artemis3> well in the streaming era ONA is kinda becoming universal, and people don't even use that acronym. Technically its not like i live in japan and everything i have watched and read was online
[17:05:37] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Blue Period | Episode: 11
[17:08:06] <pretender2> Artemis3: Yeah actually 8mins ago, I thought ONA was chinese anime
[17:09:55] <Artemis3> In the 90ies a series was made, you could only watch it if you subscribed, kinda like an Encyclopedia or collection of books thing. They would mail you a Laserdisc with 4 episodes every month or so, there was no tv airing, and of course no internet. It has 110 episodes, it made a Legend... of Galactic Heroes :3 I absolutely did not watch it because some american copied those and paid a professional translator so he could fansub it. Nope, i didn't call 
[17:09:55] <Artemis3> them a decade later on certain anime forum which made them releae the whole thing on torrents. To this day, there is no other "legit" source to get it, but in japan (DVDs, which is boring) and worse, there is some remake i haven't watched.
[17:11:56] <Artemis3> In short, it is too good for the likes of Netflix :)
[17:12:33] <Artemis3> I think its still the top ever Anime on AnimeDB and maybe on MAL and others
[17:13:47] <pretender2> Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu?
[17:13:54] <Artemis3> Oh well there was a movie in 89 to get the thing started, yeah, GED
[17:13:57] <pretender2> It's on #8
[17:14:19] <Artemis3> well it was #1 some years ago, its been a while, its old now
[17:15:05] <Artemis3> but imagine yourself with no internet spending quite the sum in that subscription waiting for the next disc to arrive
[17:15:53] <Artemis3> two or three decades before streaming. The model is simillar tho, exclusive to subscribers, and yet not tv
[17:16:11] <Artemis3> its also a crowd funding if you look at it closely
[17:16:34] <pretender2> It's old but it's still on one of the top anime in the first page, means it's really good
[17:16:37] <Artemis3> no other animation has been made like this until this era
[17:17:11] <Artemis3> they didn't have to change it to accomodate the studios or the tv station or the announcer, or whatever
[17:17:33] <Artemis3> they had free reign, could hire the best voice actors (there are some legends in there, take a look)
[17:17:57] <Artemis3> this is the ultimate, i read the written novel a bit but the anime is better lol
[17:18:07] <Artemis3> it has even more detail
[17:18:39] <Artemis3> not all anime are bad adaptation, but it takes... something incredible like this
[17:18:59] <Artemis3> as a business model, that was madness, its incredible they made it
[17:19:24] <pretender2> You make me want to try to watch it
[17:19:25] <Artemis3> the super loyal fans that subscribed they literally paid a comission to have it made
[17:19:44] <Artemis3> its especial on many ways, i don't know how to describe it
[17:20:02] <Artemis3> i can't belive something like this was ever done in such a way
[17:20:22] <Artemis3> it breaks everything you now about production or whatnot, how shows and series and movies are made
[17:20:26] <Artemis3> know
[17:21:06] <Artemis3> so hbo or netflix or such orders the making of a show because ratings... remove that middle man
[17:21:58] <Artemis3> and this long? i mean, a 13 ep production you can understand, but 110 episodes? Yes they even made even a 52ish more which were like a prelude to the stories

[18:19:42] <Bco1981> MootPoot: you ssh into your box, and open screen or re-attach it.
[18:20:14] <Urchin[emacs]> screen -r

[18:20:25] <Urchin[emacs]> not sure what tmux equivalent is
[18:20:30] <MootPoot> re-attach?
[18:20:54] <Bco1981> MootPoot: you can detach the "screen" and log off ssh
[18:21:03] <Urchin[emacs]> yes, you detach the session, disconnect, and reattach the session when you reconnect
[18:21:04] <MootPoot> ssh into box -> start up screen / tmux -> tell it to create sub-terminals?
[18:21:10] <Urchin[emacs]> and the stuff runs
[18:21:18] <Urchin[emacs]> good for runing IRC clients or torrents
[18:21:41] <Bco1981> keeping btop running in one
[18:22:01] <zoidberg> you can just close the shell like alt-f4 but the session runs in ram
[18:22:12] <MootPoot> Bco1981: what do you mean "screen"
[18:22:13] <MootPoot> like 
[18:22:19] <zoidberg> in tmux, it's tmux attach <session name>
[18:22:21] <MootPoot> is it like a virtual desktop
[18:22:27] <MootPoot> or display that gets forwarded
[18:22:27] <Bco1981> yes

[18:22:44] <Bco1981> Urchin[emacs]: shows network trafik and disk too

[21:05:43] <Cryowolf> emmeka, who cares what netflix do with their adaptations? It's not like they're gonna be good anyway
[21:05:49] <MootPoot> they ruined the girls character in bebop

[21:05:59] <MootPoot> decent*
[21:05:59] <Bco1981> emmeka: luckly, i don't have that either. i don't have any streaming service.
[21:06:15] <emmeka> Bco1981 like everyone lost their shit about that 1 line in the Dragon Maid dub, because feminism in muh animes!!! but the line isn't important, the original line isn't funny or insightful or good, and the new line isn't even that big of a change
[21:06:26] <MootPoot> which line
[21:07:10] <Bco1981> can't remember where it was but there are being visual changes made. fuck no.
[21:07:11] <emmeka> MootPoot there's a throwaway line in which Lucoa complains about attention from men due to her clothes/appearance, in the dub she says something about "pesky patriarchal norms" instead
[21:07:45] <Bco1981> i wan't the version the creator made, to get the story they intended to portray.
[21:07:49] <Bco1981> want*
[21:08:09] <Cryowolf> emmeka, I don't like those kinds of changes because it's the translator rewriting the dialogue. I want proper translations. Not added, whether it's activism or not but especially not activism. Get western political activism away from my anime
[21:08:12] <MootPoot> oh, yeah
[21:08:21] <emmeka> Bco1981 there's been a handful of times that happened but all of them acceptable enough, imo. Like Crunchyroll sort of barred out/used a blur effect on the literal rape scene in Alicization

[21:12:34] <Urchin[emacs]> the localisation sounds pretty good
[21:12:42] <emmeka> which has very different meanings in Japanese and English
[21:12:59] <MootPoot> oh ok
[21:13:10] <buZz> MootPoot: sorry, unnative speaker
[21:13:22] <Cryowolf> so what would the accurate translation be then? I suppose an example would be handy just so I have the context at hand

[21:16:15] <Cryowolf> I don't care either. I just want to read it as it was originally intended

[21:16:52] <Cryowolf> well I do have time actually
[21:16:55] <emmeka> there is no such thing as directly analogous translations, translation is an attempt to bridge two distinct cultures

[21:17:41] <Cryowolf> emmeka, sure...I never noticed big social changes in translations when it was mostly fan translations

[21:18:52] <Cryowolf> Urchin[emacs], I usually don't,. except when it becomes very on the nose political commentary or reference
[21:19:04] <omero> and that is precisely the reason that works always work better in their original language in the time context
[21:19:08] <Cryowolf> or some kind of modern reference even if not political

[22:20:38] <riv> when i said 'horrible people' i was referring to bigots, not transpeople
[22:20:59] <riv> its funny looking back and seeing how that is totally ambiguous

[22:22:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Hmm... wikipedia & amigo would probably say I'm slightly off.
[22:22:20] <snake> Yeah 2d > 3dpd
[22:22:29] <Cryowolf> It's strange how I can fully support trans peoples right to be trans. Gay peoples right to be gay etc e tc and still use the word trap as a joke about a subset of anime characters like Felix from Re:Zero or Astolfo From Fate/Apocrypha

[22:23:26] <emmeka> riv the Juliet quote could've been interpreted either way... and that's even assuming people reading it knew the context, which, in a channel with many second language English speakers, isn't likely

[22:23:40] <MootPoot> ok
[22:23:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (Failed last time we tried, so obviously not the way to do it)
[22:24:05] <Vohveli> the meaning of "otoko no ko" is obviously not the same as "trap", though it refers to the same type of characters

[22:24:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: lel
[22:24:20] <snake> Finally a policy i can get behind
[22:24:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Vohveli: Trap is a bit more pejorative and dipped in chan culture.
[22:25:12] <Vohveli> "trap" further implies that the character baits (or is intended to bait) a heterosexual male viewer to fall for the character
[22:25:17] <Jigsy> It's like how people think the okay hand sign is racist.
[22:25:27] <Jigsy> I honestly hope those people drown the next time they go diving.
[22:25:31] <Cryowolf> if you overreact and begin to give power to a word that didn't have that power before, you're empowering bigotry
[22:25:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Vohveli: Ah, not quite. Channer use is more generic and applies even if no real baiting occurs.
[22:25:48] <snake> Yeah or that the peace sign means antichrist
[22:25:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> "owo very cute" "owo has a dick" "owo a trap is fine too"
[22:26:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Sorta.

[22:31:04] <snake> Nah

[22:36:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If you include people that use serotonin in their brain I'll agree. /s
[22:36:13] <snake> Cryowolf: coffee is ok IMO
[22:36:18] <snake> And medicine
[22:36:20] <snake> And otc
[22:36:22] <Jigsy> Still drugs.
[22:36:28] <Jigsy> You don't get to cherry pick.
[22:36:37] <snake> I do get to cherry pick
[22:36:43] <Jigsy> No, you literally don't.
[22:36:43] <Cryowolf> snake, then if they make heroin legal and otc, you have no problem with it right?
[22:36:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Literally what difference is there between pharmacy sold psychotropics in the Netherlands and homegrown besides reliability?
[22:37:06] <snake> Cryowolf: thats not scientific
[22:37:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Legal != moral != logical.
[22:37:23] <Cryowolf> eh?
[22:37:27] <Jigsy> My Mom's very anti-drugs.
[22:37:31] <Jigsy> She's also an alcoholic, so...
[22:37:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The law is rarely based on scientific conclusions.
[22:37:54] <Cryowolf> ok so lets switch it then, have heroin be on sale like alcohol is
[22:37:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Look at the sale of alcohol being legal in many countries while shrooms (much safer and practically impossible to overdose on) aren't.
[22:38:17] <snake> I reject your thought experiment since its absurd
[22:38:19] <Cryowolf> you should be fine with heroin then
[22:38:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Indeed, the law is absurd.
[22:38:30] <Jigsy> Smoking is completely illegal in Turkmenistan.
[22:38:45] <Jigsy> Your move, snake.
[22:38:51] <Cryowolf> no it isn't. Alcohol is quite dangerous to your health and addiction to it can kill you
[22:38:57] <snake> Im not fine with alcohol drinkers being alive
[22:39:03] <snake> But alcohol is legal
[22:39:12] <MootPoot> cum
[22:39:19] <snake> So the point about legalizing heroin is moot
[22:39:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Properly dosed heroin is about as safe as alcohol.
[22:39:27] <Cryowolf> then the same with nicotine, it's a stimulant and would be illegal if discovered today
[22:39:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That should be more an indictment against alcohol than a defense for heroin.
[22:39:44] <Jigsy> Nicotine is toxic, iirc.
[22:39:47] <Cryowolf> it is
[22:39:50] <Jigsy> At least large doses.
[22:39:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Most dangerous psychotropics are.
[22:40:02] <snake> What part about kill all drugscum dont you understand
[22:40:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Namely ethanol.
[22:40:03] <Jigsy> I saw that in an episode of Quincy.
[22:40:06] <snake> Sheedh
[22:40:10] <snake> Seesh*
[22:40:21] <snake> Fuck my sausage fingers :(
[22:40:22] <Cryowolf> the one where you think caffeine is ok :P
[22:40:29] <Jigsy> snake: Would you want Nootropics drugs users dead?
[22:40:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: It's an absurd statement. Your brain produces minute amounts of DMT. Should we therefore kill everyone who has a brain?
[22:40:37] <Cryowolf> just because you like it
[22:40:55] <snake> Theres more to drug scum than drug
[22:41:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's also unjustifiable to murder people who are not harming anyone else.
[22:41:16] <snake> Coffee does not have so many megative consequences as heroin or alcohol
[22:41:17] <Jigsy> Yes or no, snake.
[22:41:27] <Cryowolf> the body produces endomorphine and when you run for about 10 miles, you'll release about an equivilant of 5mg of morphine into your body afaik
[22:41:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: Then drugs aren't purely the issue and you shouldn't oversimplify phrasing to the point that it's ambiguous.
[22:41:44] <Cryowolf> which is why it's called a runners high
[22:41:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (It's a fairly weak high tbh)
[22:41:59] <Jigsy> What about Combat high?
[22:42:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Jigsy: Has more to do with adrenalyne
[22:42:14] *** Quits: KolaniNG (~KOLANI@104.163.174.140) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:42:15] <Jigsy> Yeah.
[22:42:27] <snake> !c nootropics
[22:42:28] <ImoutoBot> snake: Nootropics are drugs, supplements, and other substances that are claimed to improve cognitive function, particularly executive functions, memory, creativity, or motivation, in healthy individuals.
[22:42:38] *** Joins: KOLANI (~KOLANI@104.163.174.140)
[22:42:46] <snake> Jigsy: dunno
[22:42:50] <Cryowolf> then legalization of less harmful drugs would take power away from gangs and cartels and reduce the harmful effects by a ton
[22:42:56] <Jigsy> How can you not know?
[22:42:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Adrenaline is a pretty hard stimulant.
[22:42:59] <Jigsy> They're drugs, snake.
[22:43:20] <snake> The devil is in the details
[22:43:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: Then do spell out the bloody details.
[22:43:39] <Jigsy> That didn't seem to matter for caffiene or alcohol to you, though.
[22:43:44] <snake> No, i dont think i will
[22:43:50] <Cryowolf> decriminalization of harmful drugs would make it easier to seek help when you're not put in jail/prison for possession for personal use and given access to criminals and more contacts for buying drugs
[22:43:53] <Cryowolf> maybe harder ones
[22:44:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> snake: So you're baiting with some pseudo-genocidal statement and then refusing to elaborate.
[22:44:17] * Aurora_v_kosmose slow clap
[22:44:42] <snake> Memocidal
[22:44:54] <Cryowolf> the current system is set up so the gangs and such benefit and the addicted are harmed and sucked further into that world when all they are is desperate, because they're unwell for some reason that they're not being given help for
[22:44:58] <Jigsy> Just legalize all drugs.
[22:45:20] <Jigsy> People are going to put stuff in their bodies regardless of it's legal or not.
[22:45:34] <Cryowolf> the drugsellers and gangs are taking advantaged of the mentally unwell to push drugs on them
[22:45:38] <Cryowolf> get them addicted
[22:45:39] <Jigsy> ^
[22:45:49] <Cryowolf> and keep them as customers
[22:46:16] <Cryowolf> if they're out of money, they might go "here's a freebie", so they don't get sober while they have no m oney
[22:46:28] <Cryowolf> cause if they get sober they might not want back in
[22:47:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They also sell stuff you can't go clean easily & alone on without dying.
[22:47:15] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's why they taint their product.
[22:47:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And laws against personal use & possession directly lead to that outcome working.
[22:48:04] <Cryowolf> treating drug users as scum and vilifying them instead of asking why they're using, what made them start using. If they don't want to quit, you could give them a medicine version of it in one of those drug addiction programs where they give you buprenorphine or metadone
[22:48:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> As you can't just wean yourself off progressively (as required for a lot of things).
[22:48:32] <Cryowolf> the reason you do this is to keep them away from the criminal elements until they are ready to stop
[22:48:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The most popular categories of mood alterants, antidepressants, widely requires progressive weaning off. 
[22:48:49] <Jigsy> I tried quitting coffee cold turkey once just so I could get back down to a normal level of coffee intake.
[22:48:50] <Cryowolf> and to make sure they can have a more stable life when they no longer need to live around affording their next dose
[22:48:51] <Jigsy> HUGE mistake.
[22:49:09] <Cryowolf> then they can actually focus on their life instead and one day maybe want more of it so they quit
[22:49:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Jigsy: I did, by forgetting to buy some and having no car, for a while. A week of headaches, moodiness and tiredness and I got back to roughly okay after that. 
[22:49:33] <Jigsy> I ended up with a massive migrane.
[22:49:41] <Jigsy> It was so bad I had to go to bed in the end.
[22:49:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah that's the typical side effect.
[22:50:00] <Jigsy> Sadly I'm back up to three/four cups a day.
[22:50:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I've had stress headaches since forever so I'm sorta used to them.
[22:50:06] <Jigsy> I should probably drop down to two a day for a while.
[22:50:10] <Jigsy> Then down to one/day.
[22:50:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Well, it's better now that school exams are in my past.
[22:50:30] <Cryowolf> all of that is better than just leaving them to rot because you'll keep feeding the criminal elements. Even if you don't care about the addict. Your will to have them abandoned leads to the empowerment of the gangs all the way up the chain and this increases violence everywhere
[22:50:32] <snake> I have two cups of coffee each day. So yummy
[22:50:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (What a dumb counterproductive structure... -_-)
[22:50:46] <Cryowolf> cause the drug trade is one of the most violent things you can find
[22:51:09] <Jigsy> I don't know, what about Hitmen?
[22:51:13] <Jigsy> Or child sex trafficking?
[22:51:21] <Cryowolf> if you're in a business where you make hundreds of millions of dollars, you're gonna be ready to kill for it, kill a lot
[22:51:24] <Jigsy> Hell, any sex trafficking.
[22:51:43] <Cryowolf> sex trafficking is horrible but not that big nor worth that much money
[22:51:51] <Cryowolf> its worth a lot
[22:51:56] <Cryowolf> and has a lot of violence
[22:51:59] <Cryowolf> but not as much as drugs
[22:52:34] <Cryowolf> anyway Im off, cya later
[22:52:52] <Jigsy> o/
[22:52:53] <snake> Cya. Good luck with the treatment program idea
[22:54:31] <Urchin[emacs]> coffee is still a hard drug
[22:54:50] <Urchin[emacs]> it forms a biological addiction
[22:54:55] <snake> Where is it on the hardness scale?
[22:55:12] <snake> Is it harder than diamonds? Or perhaps hard like coal
[22:55:28] <snake> Or soft like lime?
[22:55:35] <snake> Limestone*
[22:55:40] <Poeticode> I've never had caffeine withdrawals but i've taken some rough caffeine shits
[22:55:50] <snake> Lool
[22:55:54] <analoq> Urchin[emacs]: coffee != caffeine
[22:56:40] <analoq> as someone who abused the living shit out of caffeine. If you want to know how depression feels like, heavily abuse caffeine than stop cold turkey :p
[22:56:57] <analoq> i recommend caffeine powder
