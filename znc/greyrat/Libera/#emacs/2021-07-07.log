[01:48:25] <wgreenhouse> technomancy: possibly. but really really old sdk versions installed through not-play still work 
[01:49:04] <wgreenhouse> technomancy: android only sort of has a standard library; if you don't link to play services (termux doesn't) these sdk deprecations aren't a thing
[01:49:33] <arch> The thing is that W^X means that you can only install things that can be EXECVE'd with APKs, and since 10, there have been updates that make that not require user interaction with each and every package
[01:49:43] <technomancy> wgreenhouse: so you run forever without getting security updates?

[01:51:26] <technomancy> completely unusable when I tried it ~1y ago but it does look like there's been a lot of progress since then
[01:51:43] <makomo> does anyone know how emacs handles the fact that some keyboard events can have multiple representations (from what i can see)? e.g. the event C-a is represented by the character code 1 (the SOH control character in ASCII), but could also be represented by character code (+ ?a (expt 2 26)) 
[01:51:44] *** Quits: PacMiam (~PacMiam@user/pacmiam) (Quit: Beam to ship)
[01:52:03] <makomo> in the latter, i just manually set the control modifier bit in the value

[01:53:26] <makomo> and the former is just because of emacs' special casing of control modifiers for some characters in the ASCII range (?\C-a gives the 1 from above)

[01:53:42] <arch> makomo: Some things just bind to the character if it's easier
[01:53:42] <arch> For example, C-Space is ^@, which means that when you C-h k C-Space, you can see that it's actually pulling up the binding for C-@
[01:54:05] <aidalgol> wgreenhouse: Not "open enough to satisfy FOSS pedants."
[01:54:21] <wgreenhouse> aidalgol: probably something no longer maintained, then, like maemo/tizen
[01:55:02] <technomancy> rudybot: free as in "we have to rewrite our entire package system whenever google tells us to"
[01:55:15] <rudybot> technomancy: the fact that w3m is able to rewrite terminal buffer in X to display images tells a lot about the wtf that X is
[01:55:25] <arch> wgreenhouse: Yeaaaah D:
[01:55:25] <arch> Though with noninteractive installs and on-device apk builds, I wonder if you can just have a rootfs that can be updated with a wrapper that builds an apk and installs it as a library

[01:56:45] <makomo> arch: aren't C-Space and C-@ distinct characters though? also, i thought NUL was C-@? running C-h k C-Space i can see that *both* C-Space and C-@ are keybinds for the given command

[02:06:31] <makomo> (instead of this kbd + aref hack, you could also just specify them as character constants with ?\C-\s and ?\C-@, but i wanted it to be "faithful" so that we avoid any other indirections/layers)
[02:07:15] <makomo> event-modifiers gives '(control) for both of the events, but event-basic-type gives 32 (i.e. ASCII code for space) for one, and 64 (i.e. ASCII code for @) for the other

[22:37:27] <ben`> Hey all, I'm new to IRC, so let me know if I'm doing it wrong. Anyway, I have a question about lexical bindings, specifically some consult/embark related stuff.
[22:38:31] <arch> Oh! Welcome!
[22:39:18] <ben`> Actually the issue comes up with affe, made by Daniel Mendler, creator of consult. He recommends to enable lexical binding in everyone's init.el, and it's enabled in affe.el.

[22:40:22] <ben`> In affe.el (with lexical binding enabled) is the following function:
[22:40:39] <ben`> (defun affe--read (prompt dir &rest args)
[22:40:39] <ben`>   "Asynchronous selection function with PROMPT in DIR.
[22:40:39] <ben`> ARGS are passed to `consult--read'."
[22:40:39] <ben`>   (let* ((prompt-dir (consult--directory-prompt prompt dir))
[22:40:42] <ben`>          (default-directory (cdr prompt-dir)))
[22:40:45] <ben`>     (apply #'consult--read
[22:40:49] <ben`>            `(,@args :prompt ,(car prompt-dir)

[22:42:51] <arch> (https://bpa.st/+emacs)
[22:43:40] <ben`> Got it. Anyway, my question is that, since lexical binding is enabled, doesn't the let* binding of default directory do nothing? Because default-directory is not used inside the textual scope of let*?

[22:46:09] <wasamasa> you can still use dynamic binding on special variables
[22:47:19] <ben`> There is something special about default-directory?

[22:47:55] <makomo> ben`: it comes down to a property of variables (or rather, the symbols they're named by) that could be called "specialness"
[22:48:36] <makomo> whenever you define a variable using defvar, the symbol that names the variable is globally marked as "special"
[22:48:37] <ben`> \msg makomo
[22:49:00] <makomo> https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Defining-Variables.html "The variable is marked as special, meaning that it should always be dynamically bound"
[22:49:11] <makomo> the same idea exists in common lisp too (which has lexical scoping by default)
[22:49:45] <arch> ben`: So, "/msg <person> <message>" sends a private message. In most rooms, you just type a name (Which can be tab completed) followed by : to mention someone
[22:50:09] <ben`> Ah ok, that answers that question, thanks makomo
[22:50:09] <arch> These can be seen kinda like replies, and most IRC clients highlight them
[22:50:32] <makomo> /msg <nick> <msg>, or /query <nick> to open a separate chat window :)
[22:50:43] <arch> ^
[22:50:53] <ben`> arch: Ah I see, so this is not a private message, just a mention of you
[22:50:59] <arch> Yep!
[22:51:01] <makomo> yep :)
[22:51:32] <makomo> ben`: so when let is used, it knows whether to bind a name lexically or dynamically, depending on whether the symbol has the "special" property or not :)
[22:52:02] <ben`> Got it, thanks!

[22:52:19] <aindilis> how to disable a derived minor mode?
[22:52:29] <aindilis> (-mode 0) and (-mode -1) aren't working
[22:53:07] <makomo> i don't think a minor mode can be derived, can it?
[22:53:18] <aindilis> checking
[22:53:19] <makomo> but usually you can just use M-x <minor-mode> to toggle it
[22:53:40] *** Quits: mns (~mns@c-73-119-178-157.hsd1.ma.comcast.net) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[22:53:42] <makomo> if you want to disable it, then you'd run M-x <minor-mode> with a negative prefix argument
[22:55:06] <dale> aindilis: You're defining a major mode there, not a minor mode.  You don't disable major modes, you just change the major mode in use.
[22:55:12] <makomo> there's a slight difference between how the <minor-mode> function behaves with regards to its single parameter if called from elisp vs. called interactively, but in the case of switching off a mode, a negative integer as an argument turns it off in both cases
[22:55:14] <aindilis> kk, cool
[22:55:38] <aindilis> if I cannot derive a minor mode, do I just engage the mode I was wishing to derive from using (cua-mode), and then have them coeixst, or do I copy paste cua-mode code?
[22:55:59] <aindilis> I think the prior, thanks for your help, apologies for my ignorance

I have the following in my config: https://bpa.st/WEZQ, so that I can quickly get files in ~/, or in the current directory, or in /. Usually, when I do the ~/ version, and then get to a file, and then embark-act on a selection, doing the consult-file-externally command, I get an error: "The

[23:06:04] <makomo> ben`: maybe you can debug it and see where it goes wrong. take a look at toggle-debug-on-error, which will make emacs drop into the debugger when an error occurs
[23:06:43] <makomo> ben`: an unrelated stylistic tip: i would use just (lambda ...) rather than #'(lambda ...) :)
[23:07:28] <ben`> Hmm, ok. I will try that. Yeah, I am still totally confused about # vs ' vs #'.
[23:07:49] <makomo> yeah, it takes a little bit to clear out the details ;)
[23:07:50] <ben`> I guess I'm trying to set up my configuration without really learning elisp
[23:09:10] <xheimlich> you could write a simpler configuration language that compiles to elisp.
[23:09:46] <makomo> (lambda ...) is a macro that expands to #'(lambda ...), while #' is a reader macro that wraps the next sexp into a (function ...). e.g. #'foo would be read as (function foo). finally, function is a special operator that has special knowledge on how to interpret a lambda expression, so #'(lambda ...) is where it ends at, with the function operator producing a function object for you :)
[23:10:37] <makomo> or perhaps (function (lambda ...)) to be explicit :)
[23:11:36] <kaji> Hi guys, I tried vscode today and was impressed by how well vscode remote performs. Any change we could get emacs tramp to perform on that level?
[23:13:02] <dale> Judging by the diagram at the top of https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview, "remote development" here seems more akin to running Emacs remotely and forwarding it to your desktop with X11 or RFB or something.
[23:13:25] <arch> kaji: Huh! How does it compare to sshx in terms of speed?
[23:14:03] <kaji> dale: Hmmm even nomachine performs quite badly
[23:14:18] *** Quits: jcj (~jens@user/jcj) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:14:20] <arch> I find the default tramp method is kinda slow, even with cached credentials and stuff--though sshx has the added need to manage sessions with M-x list-processes when you are done
[23:14:25] <kaji> arch: I haven't tried that. Let me try it a bit
[23:14:27] <dale> kaji: Interesting, I would have expected remote Emacs to be fast.
[23:14:44] <dale> Depending on your network conditions, of course.
[23:15:06] <arch> There is still a conversion process for some things, which is kinda slow, but I think you can also rip that out
[23:15:15] <kaji> Remote is fast, yes, but using it remotely isn't lol
