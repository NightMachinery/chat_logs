[00:27:29] <ThePendulum> damn apparently online sites in the Netherlands need to guarantee the reviewer has actually used the product
[00:27:51] <ThePendulum> how the fuck do you do that lol, at best you can only let the account that bought it review it
[00:29:49] <evilgohan2> Damn you
[00:29:57] <evilgohan2> You gave me hope fb was going down again

[18:51:11] <johnhamelink> Hey friends :) So I have a ZFS array on my desktop with 47.3tb of storage across 7 drives & 2 vdevs. Currently I'm effectively running my desktop like a server, and this makes me more and more nervous over time. I want to migrate this ZFS array into a server, and I want to provide myself with a reasonable amount of expansion capacity. Does anyone have advice on what my next move should be in
[18:51:14] <johnhamelink> terms of hardware? 
[18:52:02] *** Joins: Haxxa (~Haxxa@122-199-4-24.ip4.superloop.com)
[18:52:13] <johnhamelink> (to be clear, I want to do this all with local hardware - no hosted stuff!)
[18:52:31] <ThePendulum> what's your budget? my NAS is basically just a low-end PC with a HBA card and a big case
[18:52:50] <johnhamelink> I don't have a budget yet - I'm trying to figure out what it should be so I can save
[18:53:03] <ThePendulum> but in my case I also wanted it to be able to do some other basic server tasks
[18:53:43] <johnhamelink> Should I try and aim for a rackmount server? I want to run jellyfin (so a decent GPU will be necessary), ZFS, home assistant, that sort of thing
[18:54:03] <ThePendulum> you want to run the jellyfin client straight from the server?
[18:54:26] <johnhamelink> No, just the jellyfin server - the GPU is for transcoding - or would a good quality CPU suffice for 4k content?
[18:55:35] <ThePendulum> oh right, I would think getting a slightly fancier CPU would be more cost effective than a separate GPU
[18:56:17] <johnhamelink> Ok that's exactly the sort of advice I need :D I'm a software dev, and I'm not very familiar with *this* sort of HW purchasing

[19:57:27] <ThePendulum> johnhamelink: you can get SAS to SATA cables
[19:57:49] <ThePendulum> whether you need that depends on what storage controller you'll go with
[19:58:03] *** Joins: Haxxa (~Haxxa@122-199-4-24.ip4.superloop.com)
[19:59:04] <ThePendulum> I use a new old stock LSI 9207-8i card which has two SAS connectors to which you can connect a 1x SAS to 4x SATA cable https://www.ebay.com/itm/132132729661
[19:59:09] <ThePendulum> don't think it was that expensive when I bought it though
[19:59:54] <ThePendulum> yeah I paid $50 for that exact listing at the time
[20:01:46] *** Joins: Johannes1 (~Johannes@62-220-178-82.cust.bredband2.com)
[20:04:44] <johnhamelink> ThePendulum: I'm currently using a SAS -> Sata cable to expand my motherboard's SATA capacity
[20:05:03] <johnhamelink> It's very cool indeed - it's how I'm up to 7 HDDs for ZFS
[20:05:24] <johnhamelink> So I can mix & match SATA with SAS?
[20:06:29] <ThePendulum> don't think that's in itself a problem, but that implies two different storage controllers which I reckon adds a performance tax on top of the limitations of SATA
[20:07:35] <johnhamelink> ThePendulum: Ok, that's an excellent point. In terms of ZFS, I guess the SAS drives need to have their own vdev so that I'm limiting the impact on overall performance as well... lots to ponder
[20:09:13] <ThePendulum> yeah I don't think ZFS will stop you from throwing anything on the pile, it'll just be limited by the smallest and slowest drive and controller in the pool

[21:12:17] <rawktucc> ^ i'm using one right now
[21:12:47] <rawktucc> a server is just a computer with network services active
[21:14:49] <johnhamelink> kron: I have an AIO water cooler in it that I'm running 24/7 xD
[21:15:22] <rawktucc> oh well that's concerning
[21:15:31] <johnhamelink> rawktucc: indeed - not very wise

[21:28:20] <kron> ahh, you're afraid it might leak? don't suppose replacing it with dry cooling is an option? >.>
[21:28:51] <rawktucc> in this case I would wecommend building a different machine
[21:29:05] <rawktucc> get a spare or used case dirt cheap and slap components in
[21:37:27] <johnhamelink> kron: That's exactly it. Yeah, I guess that should be the 1st thing I do - lets me buy time...
