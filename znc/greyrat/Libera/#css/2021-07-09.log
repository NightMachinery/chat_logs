[00:00:21] <birkoff> that is pretty much agreed
[00:00:37] <birkoff> any idea about my second question ?
[00:01:07] <entuland> if you refer to spacing as margin or padding, you can make it so that all the elements but the first will get it
[00:02:06] <entuland> if you refer to a flex context, I'm not sure I understand 50% of what exactly
[00:02:28] <entuland> a mockup of what you want to achieve may help
[00:02:48] <birkoff> i want each item to take 50% basically
[00:03:22] <entuland> still not clear, sorry - if you have 4 elements in a row, you can't have them all take 50% of the space
[00:03:32] <birkoff> I was asking only about 2 items
[00:03:49] <entuland> oh I see
[00:03:56] *** Quits: twomoon (~twomoon@ip72-199-58-150.sd.sd.cox.net) (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
[00:04:15] <entuland> there should be an option to have them stick to the beginning of the allocated space, with flex and grid
[00:04:32] <birkoff> DIV [ITEM1 _____ | ITEM2 _____]
[00:05:40] <hassoon> entuland: ah, ya you're right https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/327
[00:05:56] <hassoon> the span is still borderless
[00:06:16] <entuland> uhm... birkoff, flex per se doesn't allow that I think
[00:07:14] <birkoff> I just gave width:50% to each item
[00:07:37] <entuland> well, but that doesn't allow for automatically balancing the space
[00:08:10] <entuland> I mean, you're not letting flex do that with the spacing options, but if it works, that's good
[00:10:40] <entuland> could you share the full code you used to achieve that, birkoff? there has to be something more, just setting the width doesn't look enough to me
[00:11:06] <hassoon> The inherit CSS keyword causes the element for which it is specified to take the computed value of the property from its parent element. It can be applied to any CSS property, including the CSS shorthand all.
[00:11:11] <hassoon> true
[00:11:14] <birkoff> you are right it is not, it destroys flexbox wrapping
[00:11:54] <birkoff> are there cons to programmatically generating elements in JS ? like speed?
[00:12:14] <hassoon> you can generate elements only with js of course
[00:12:24] <hassoon> and you need to do it right
[00:12:37] <entuland> I wouldn't do that unless you know you can't generate the markup from the server side as needed
[00:12:52] <entuland> not for speed but just because there is no need to
[00:13:04] <hassoon> what is generating markup from server side? you mean writing html the usual way ?
[00:13:36] <entuland> could be static files or a server side language, can't tell what's birkoff's scenario
[00:13:36] <hassoon> or are you talking about ajax getting back html text to insert in the DOM ?
[00:14:02] <entuland> and yes, inheriting from only the parent looks saner, hassoon
[00:14:22] <hassoon> entuland: why server side html ? we have javascript for creating nodes and programmatic DOM manipulation ?
[00:15:02] <entuland> sure we have JS, but if it's not necessary to use it, I wouldn't use it, simple as that
[00:15:27] <hassoon> that's not convincing enough
[00:15:48] <hassoon> js is mostly necessary
[00:16:02] <entuland> I'm not trying to convince anyone, progressive enhancement is not something that one imposes or forces on others, it's just a personal preference
[00:16:11] <hassoon> you use ajax to query the server for html markup? meh no
[00:16:38] <hassoon> alright then, you do what you prefer to do
[00:17:14] <entuland> I was just stating my own POV, and I made it clear with "I wouldn't"
[00:17:38] <hassoon> meh your pov is weird
[00:17:49] <entuland> thank you

[03:17:37] <birkoff> the issues: 1) <form> inside a div messes the wrapping
[03:18:03] <birkoff> 2) form input labels are wrapping after setting some widths
[03:18:28] <birkoff> 3) when zooming in enough, the two columns don't splay the same
[03:19:02] <birkoff> 4) how to put 2 or more inputs in a row while keeping the width aligned and all ?
[03:20:00] <birkoff> basically I want the label to not wrap and take a constant width , so that the input right after it takes the same width and size on all rows/columns
[03:22:18] <birkoff> i took care of 3 and 4 by now

[03:31:39] <birkoff> it also stopped wrapping soon enough  for smaller devices
[03:31:52] <oksushi> birkoff: most likely you would need to make the form the flex container
[03:37:15] <birkoff> I guess
[03:37:26] <birkoff> how can I tell flex when to wrap in such position ?
[03:37:27] <entuland> if the form is getting in the way and you have everything else already set up, just set the form to "display: contents" and it will be like it wasn't there at all
[03:37:53] <birkoff> which method is better ?
[03:38:20] <entuland> tastes, doesn't really make any particular difference if there isn't any branching in the tree
[03:39:13] <entuland> by setting it to display: contents you can continue using the divs for the layout and only use the form as a "transparent wrapper" for your form controls
[03:39:34] <entuland> otherwise, as oksushi pointed out, apply the flex layout to the form and remove the wrapper

[05:26:28] <Rockwood> what is the better way to make website responsive?
[05:26:53] <Rockwood> media query or any framework?
[05:27:31] <Rockwood> https://react-google-charts.com/timeline-chart#an-advanced-example got awesome
[05:28:12] <entuland> those two don't really exclude each other
[05:29:40] <Rockwood> yeah
[05:29:57] <Rockwood> both are different
[05:30:14] <Rockwood> i am chking just em for use
[05:30:29] <Rockwood> media query or any framework?
[05:30:33] <oksushi> Rockwood: the best way is not to “make” the site responsive, but to design it to be responsive to begin with (by starting design mobile-first)
[05:31:09] <oksushi> when you’ve built it at the smaller size, gradually increase the screen, and add a media query when you need to make a change
[05:31:59] <Rockwood> means i have to make different layouts?
[05:32:10] <Rockwood> for each
[05:32:40] <Rockwood> hover doesn't work in case of touch screen?
[05:33:02] <Rockwood> somebody told me
[05:33:29] <Rockwood> so only on click is the option for touch screen devices?
[05:37:40] <Rockwood> oksushi, ok
[05:37:42] <entuland> you don't strictly need to make different layouts, a fluid layout could adapt automatically for larger viewports without any media query
[05:38:41] <Rockwood> but i seen this word fluid in framework
[05:38:43] <entuland> in reality, most of the times the design is complex enough to justify using media queries for precise tweaks
[05:39:07] <entuland> fluid only means that the stuff in the page will shrink or grow according to the available space
[05:39:13] <Rockwood> what is the better way for noob like me?
[05:39:25] <entuland> the best is to start reading the basics
[05:39:32] <entuland> and testing them out
[05:39:33] <Rockwood> of css
[05:39:42] <entuland> of css _and_ of html
[05:40:02] <entuland> you'll see that the default behavior for the vast majority of the base html is to be fluid and adapt automatically
[05:40:51] <entuland> only when you start adding tables, images and the alike, with constrained sizes somewhat, you'll start having to style it out to adapt properly
[05:41:39] <Rockwood> but i created layout already then?
[05:42:00] <entuland> if you are confident it's good, continue working on it
[05:42:18] <Rockwood> i just randomly doing the things
[05:42:31] <Rockwood> so no confident
[05:42:33] <entuland> if it breaks badly on mobile you'll have to see if it's worth fixing it or whether it's better to throw everything away and start from scratch
[05:42:51] <entuland> doing stuff randomly isn't good, at all
[05:43:07] <entuland> you should have at least a basic understanding of _all_ of what you use
[05:43:11] <Rockwood> yeah you are correct :( i wated time in
[05:43:14] <Rockwood> wasted
[05:43:57] <Rockwood> after frontend dev
[05:44:09] <Rockwood> lol
[05:44:34] <Rockwood> as a frontend dev i have start from the ground
[05:44:39] <Rockwood> i ve to
[05:47:57] <entuland> do that properly, if you have no idea of the difference between the various positioning contexts (static, relative, fixed and so forth) of the various display modes (block, inline, inline block and so forth) and you aren't able to tell off the top of your head which one of those applies to the main elements such as P, IMG, SPAN, the various headings and so forth, then you should _really_ start from the ground up and go back to those basics
[05:50:30] <entuland> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web this is a good starting point
[05:58:05] <Rockwood> PWA is very new thing for me
[05:58:28] <Rockwood> after reading of intro its good thing to use
[05:59:17] <entuland> don't jump right away to PWAs if you didn't get a firm grasp on the basics
[05:59:45] <entuland> unless you want to keep on going by trial and error, seriously, grasp those basics
[06:00:38] <Rockwood> ok
[06:01:00] <Rockwood> for now my full focus on basics
[06:01:05] <Rockwood> you are correct

[06:03:48] <Rockwood> i am started learning in 38 :D i don't know much
[06:04:04] <Rockwood> anyway thanks
[06:04:06] <entuland> age doesn't really matter if you're willing to learn
[06:04:27] <wintersky> that's a common lie
[06:04:55] <Rockwood> yes that is fact learning and age no relation
[06:05:04] <Rockwood> everything needs time
[06:05:28] <wintersky> younger people apply knowledge faster
[06:05:33] <wintersky> and easier
[06:05:48] <wintersky> older people rather will base on experience
[06:06:19] <Rockwood> wintersky, i don't think so experience having worse things
[06:13:04] <entuland> being faster or slower has nothing to do with the willingness to learn - if one doesn't want to learn, it's guaranteed that they'll be slow
[06:13:32] <entuland> if they are willing to learn, they may be slower due to the age (and that's debatable anyways) but at least they have a chance
[06:14:32] <entuland> where "guaranteed that they'll be slow" really means "they'll make no progress whatsoever" :P
[06:14:54] <Rockwood> i progressed :D
[06:15:00] <Rockwood> i think and try
[06:15:07] <entuland> that's good

[16:18:19] <hassoon> i'd use a whole emailing library, instead of relying on html attributes to send mails//
[16:18:22] <hassoon> *..
[16:20:48] <stenno> eeh
[16:20:56] <entuland> unfortunately there is no alternative when you want the user to send the email using their own account, the fields you put in the mailto are the only option
[16:20:56] <stenno> its not really neccessary
[16:21:11] <stenno> yeah also that
[16:24:03] <hassoon> entuland: why so? i can dedicate a text input for the user to input their email address, text area for the email content, then a button to submit the mail message
[16:24:18] <entuland> that wouldn't be sending the email using the user's email
[16:24:35] <entuland> you'd have to send that data to your website, and send it from your own mailing system
[16:24:36] <hassoon> entuland: the user's mail is for them to type it, why not
[16:24:48] <entuland> what if they put a dummy address there?
[16:25:42] <entuland> the purpose of the mailto links is to pass the data to whatever mail client they choose - be it online gmail, outlook, thunderbird or whatever else
[16:25:42] <hassoon> it's their own fault, also, that gives them more freedom to specify the mail address, maybe they got multiple mail addresses? maybe they just want to stay anonymous? who knows
[16:26:19] <hassoon> entuland: sure, but oh well ..
[16:26:31] <entuland> it's just different means and different purposes
[16:26:44] <hassoon> if they are happy using the mailto, then fine
[16:31:48] <stenno> using mailto has just a lot of advances
[16:31:52] <stenno> advantages
[16:32:19] <hassoon> stenno: well ya, it's pretty widespread and popular
[16:32:21] <stenno> you don't have to configure your own mailserver, you don't need to worry about handling/escaping user input
[16:32:56] <entuland> and you know the email comes from a valid mailbox
[16:32:56] <stenno> probably also better regarding accessibility because then the userspace mail client will be used

[19:37:30] *** Quits: varaindemian (~varaindem@86.124.78.162) (Quit: Client closed)
[19:38:35] <entuland> you could give it some margin-bottom or some margin-top
[19:39:03] <entuland> there isn't a precise definition of "vertically aligned" in that context, so you'll have to eyeball it
[19:39:33] <entuland> more than vertically centering it, you should make it so the text in the image lines up at the bottom with the rest of the line
[19:41:28] *** Joins: dibber (~dibber@c-73-14-187-235.hsd1.co.comcast.net)
[19:41:45] <entuland> a margin bottom of -0.3em could do, Helmholtz2
[19:42:13] <Helmholtz2> entuland, align:center can't do it?
[19:42:36] <entuland> there is a baseline alignment for images, but that's a limited solution
[19:43:06] <entuland> also, did you try that "align:center" yourself?
[19:43:58] <Helmholtz2> entuland, yes didn't wokr
[19:44:09] <entuland> well, yes, there is no such a property
[19:44:19] <entuland> did you check the docs to see the available styling for images?
[19:44:26] <hassoon> Helmholtz2: https://jsfiddle.net/hassoon/bsqe8nuc/
[19:44:51] <entuland> if you did, you should have found vertical align, which takes top, middle and bottom and baseline values
[19:45:25] <Helmholtz2> entuland, Also tried that didn't work
[19:45:35] <entuland> unlikely, since it worked for me
[19:45:40] <entuland> anyways, use whatever works
[19:46:11] <entuland> you could keep it inline and use the margin, you could use the vertical align, or you could change it as hasson suggested, although that takes more declarations probably
[19:46:36] <entuland> https://jsfiddle.net/c3jxnpfo/
[19:49:02] <hassoon> eh so verticalAlign alone is enough
[19:49:40] <entuland> it is enough in this very case, had the image been differently panned, it wouldn't have aligned properly
[19:49:53] <hassoon> ya nice
[19:52:28] <Helmholtz2> hassoon, entuland thanks...I just set the height of img manually
[19:52:45] <entuland> yw, yes, such things have to be tweaked manually
[19:53:18] <entuland> if the image has to line up nicely according to the size of the text, just use em values and you should be good if you decide to change the font size
