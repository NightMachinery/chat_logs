[03:08:59] <toretto> So, `defer` statements always runs at the end of the scope(`}`) right?
[03:09:16] <A_Dragon> not at the end, whenever it returns
[03:09:33] <toretto> ah, yeah, returns from that particular scope right?
[03:09:41] <A_Dragon> current function
[03:09:51] <A_Dragon> which may or may not be the only scope within said function
[03:10:08] <A_Dragon> they're basically a way to insert the stuff after defer before every return in a function
[03:10:11] <A_Dragon> regardless of location
[03:11:47] <toretto> In this case, I'm not sure why the fmt.Println with defer prints unpredictable number of times: https://play.golang.org/p/e4IqGvp8glh
[03:12:11] <toretto> It's inside for
[03:12:18] *** Joins: knassar702 (~knassar70@197.35.74.60)
[03:13:56] <b0nn> Seems to me to be correct
[03:14:09] <b0nn> a defer is added to the list each time the loop runs
[03:14:17] <b0nn> so, 8 times
[03:14:56] <A_Dragon> yeah
[03:15:09] <toretto> no, when i run it multiple times, it sometimes prints 2 or 3 times. it's unpredictable.
[03:15:21] <A_Dragon> that would be because
[03:15:35] <A_Dragon> your defers are running AFTER your .Done()
[03:15:42] <b0nn> I cannot repeat your issue
[03:15:44] <A_Dragon> so, right at the end of everything, and main exits
[03:15:53] <A_Dragon> try add a sleep after the wait, they should all appear
[03:16:15] <b0nn> oh yeah the defer list is being executed in the context of a goroutine but the main goroutine may have already exited
[03:16:25] <A_Dragon> or, the right way to do it, would be to defer wg.Don() as the first thing as the function.
[03:16:32] <A_Dragon> Done*
[03:16:57] <A_Dragon> that way, all of the other defers happen first, then the Done() then the function exits
[03:17:37] <toretto> hmm, i see.
[03:17:45] <toretto> yeah, that works.
[03:18:00] <A_Dragon> this is a function of your example, to be clear
[03:18:12] <A_Dragon> in a larger program doing other things the defers would likely be fine
[03:18:24] <A_Dragon> they're just cut short because the main goroutine is exiting
[03:18:39] <toretto> ya, makes sense.

[16:27:42] <dngray[m]> hmm, does anyone use go instead of bash/sh scripts?
[16:27:50] <A_Dragon> depends on what I need
[16:28:11] <A_Dragon> Im more likely to use a python oneliner in a shell script, but Ive also written code for scripts in go

[16:30:55] <siXy> If you actually _remove_ bash from your machines, then you're going to have a bad time. Don't do that.
[16:31:24] <dngray[m]> so i am thinking it might be the right tool for the job, i can drop the static binary on my machine then, and not worry
[16:31:38] <A_Dragon> note: on most systems `sh` does NOT exist, it is a symlink to bash.
[16:32:23] <A_Dragon> CoolerX: it appears that you likely want to install that path directly.
[16:32:28] <A_Dragon> or just download and build the binary
[16:32:55] <A_Dragon> dngray[m]: sounds like you're overcomplicating things
[16:33:02] *** Quits: icebreaker (~icebreake@user/icebreaker) (Quit: leaving)
[16:33:04] <A_Dragon> for one, go binaries are not always static
[16:33:09] <A_Dragon> so, dont assume that they will be
[16:33:12] <siXy> dngray[m]: Just leave it how it is. You're very unlikely to be allowed access to any machines that actually require you to write posix compatible shell scripts.
[16:33:15] <A_Dragon> some things can and will link to libc.

[16:33:20] <A_Dragon> and ^
[16:33:43] <dngray[m]> go has the option of statically compiling a binary, then all i would need is a c library
[16:33:49] <siXy> dngray[m]: note that using zsh as your default shell does not mean bash scripts won't work. bash is still there.
[16:33:50] <CoolerX> Hmm https://github.com/go-jose/go-jose
[16:33:59] <CoolerX> They forked the repo and released a v3
[16:34:18] <dngray[m]> siXy: mm i was kind of thinking that, but i was also kind of thinking of doing something neater
[16:34:21] <CoolerX> How do I uninstall the old one? go uninstall?
[16:34:22] <A_Dragon> dngray[m]: go by default is static. However, networking often links to libc *dynamically* unless you use netgo. As will anything that touches users.
[16:34:25] <dngray[m]> fortunately its only like two scripts
[16:34:37] <A_Dragon> CoolerX: rm the binary, if it exists.

[16:34:58] <ikke> with musl, you can make mostly a self-contained binary

[16:35:22] <siXy> which is better.
[16:35:29] <A_Dragon> ....hahahahahahaha
[16:35:40] <bookworm> XD
[16:35:45] <A_Dragon> for the most part, if you dont touch users and networking you wont need libc

[18:17:27] <siXy> Beyond that we can't say, as you've not included enough of your code.
[18:19:36] <rootbox> siXy: no i don't ignore that, i stuck on it. most of the time the go compiler is perfectly clear, but it's the first time i encounter a panic rountieme error. i try to learn and sometimes asking is part of the process to learn (at least for me)
[18:20:13] <rootbox> i belive i don't have to say that i'm a bloody beginner
[18:22:26] <siXy> rootbox: On line 21: r, _ := http.NewRequest( .... ) the _ is where you're ignoring the error. You shouldn't be doing that.
[18:23:07] <rootbox> oooh yeah that's not good, don't even now why i did that
[18:23:13] <siXy> Your real problem is likely somewhere else, in the parts of the code you haven't shown us, but you may as well fix that first.

[18:28:13] <fizzie> I think that's a not-implausible cause for the "real problem" as well, given that if that request does return an error, r is likely to be nil, and the panic happens due to a nil pointer deference inside the ServeHTTP call that gets r passed to it.
[18:30:01] <fizzie> (Though I guess NewRequest isn't that likely to fail except for completely invalid methods or unparseable URLs.)
