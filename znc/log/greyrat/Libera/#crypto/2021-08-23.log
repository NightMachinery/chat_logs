[06:51:31] <^-^hi> wouldn't it make more sense to send static content without TLS, but have another port provide checksums for the content with TLS?
[06:51:56] *** Joins: milkt (~debian@gateway/tor-sasl/milkt)
[06:52:34] <danieldg> if you don't care about privacy.  Note that you'd have to change how HTTP headers work.
[06:53:12] <^-^hi> would save much cpu when all you are encrypting is very very few bytes of sums.
[06:53:36] <^-^hi> as for privacy, that is a job to be done by proxies
[06:53:38] <danieldg> cpu is pretty cheap
[06:54:05] <danieldg> and proxies are going to raise the cpu cost back up even higher
[06:54:14] <danieldg> so net loss
[06:54:22] <^-^hi> the advantage for https is pretty much that they can't tap into the connection
[06:54:44] <^-^hi> and that could be done by checksums
[06:55:02] <danieldg> nope, the advantage is also that the content is unknown
[06:55:13] <^-^hi> what else does it provide in case of static content? they already see where you are connecting to
[06:55:45] <danieldg> they'd see wikipedia, not wikipedia/foo
[06:55:59] <danieldg> but if you serve the foo images in plaintext...
[06:57:42] *** Joins: kikijiki (~Thunderbi@user/kikijiki)
[07:00:51] <^-^hi> yes but my point is that they already see much. that would make some difference for big centralized services (which is itself a privacy risk), but not for people who visit evilwebsite.com or something.
[07:01:21] <danieldg> if your website has only one page, this is true
[07:02:05] <^-^hi> and the only ultimate solution to that is some proxy like tor or something. and proxy+tls>proxy+no tls
[07:03:07] <^-^hi> danieldg: that only matters for big centralized services. i could be visiting evilwebsite.com/page1 or evilwebsite.com/page2 but that wont make much difference
[07:03:32] <danieldg> being able to distinguish evil.com/guns and evil.com/porn is a threat
[07:04:00] <danieldg> different people will want to ban each one
[07:04:35] <^-^hi> and you can optimize a lot of stuff when you only send one thing over and over
[07:04:53] <danieldg> you can do that with tls
[07:04:56] *** Quits: kikijiki (~Thunderbi@user/kikijiki) (Quit: kikijiki)
[07:05:15] <^-^hi> and providing a checksum api enables others to provide the content as well, but also ensuring the integrity
[07:05:47] <danieldg> that's useful, but not a good argument for dropping encryption
[07:06:04] <^-^hi> so it could reduce the load alot.
[07:06:06] <danieldg> it's an argument for adding sums
[07:06:13] <danieldg> not a big issue
[07:06:35] <ericonr> You'd get so many vulns from wrongly dropping the encryption part of TLS
[07:07:01] <danieldg> yep, added complexity is the enemy of security

[18:25:03] <TimMc> ^-^hi: Integrating content-addressed fetching into browsers would solve some of these problems.
[18:26:11] <TimMc> e.g. if your browser sees <img src="..." content-id="..."> it could skip the src URL and instead try fetching the file by its content hash ID from various proxies.
[18:28:38] <ms7821> people are generally bad at distinguishing privacy-sensitive data from actually public data
[18:29:52] <ms7821> is a profile image something that could be fetched in plaintext in the face of a passive adversary?
[18:30:08] <ms7821> what about all profile images for your friends?

[18:38:20] <ericonr> Peng: hm, you know the host the person accessed and the gravatar profiles they are fetching, could probably find a subset of possible articles they are accessing
[18:38:32] <ericonr> seems like a niche attack either way, but it's interesting to think about
[18:40:00] <TimMc> You'd definitely want to have the browser give the user control over when that content hash is used.
[18:40:07] <ms7821> I bet it's being done automatically at scale
[18:40:53] <TimMc> Fetching large JS bundles from CDNs seems like a pretty harmless use, for instance.
[18:41:54] <TimMc> Even with TLS an eavesdropping adversary can probably figure out a lot of the Wikipedia articles you view just based on response size fingerprints.
[18:42:27] <TimMc> (article response was X kilobytes, and included images of Y and Z kilobytes...)
[18:42:50] <TimMc> HTTP/2 would help *somewhat*...
[18:43:23] <Haohmaru> wikipedia should add some random void-filling chunk of data to each page load

[19:00:42] <TimMc> There are a number of differences from 1.1, but one of the most interesting is that it allows multiplexing a response so that images and CSS and JS come down the pipe along with the HTML that will refer to them.
[19:02:45] <TimMc> It's a much more complicated protocol and I have very mixed feelings about that.
[19:04:38] <Alipha> ... the things that are "safe" to be sent over http are also the things that are highly cached, so i don't think you're saving much. just have the browser cache more

[19:27:09] <TimMc> Mmm, sort of. That definitely applies for repeated use on the same origin.
[19:28:24] <TimMc> For first-fetch for a given origin, not so much. And I guess browsers are actually moving away from shared caching across origins.
