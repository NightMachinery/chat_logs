[04:23:57] <Work-BWMerlin> YEs
[04:24:45] <Work-BWMerlin> Are client systems and member servers that are not domain controllers known to be affected by the vulnerability?
[04:24:46] <Work-BWMerlin> Yes, if any of the following conditions exist:
[04:24:46] <Work-BWMerlin>     Point and Print is enabled
[04:24:47] <Work-BWMerlin>     If the Authenticated Users group is nested within any of the groups that are listed in the mitigation section.

[04:31:02] <xe0n> huh? you mean the samaccountname?
[04:31:31] <xe0n> Option 2 - Disable inbound remote printing through Group Policy is the sensible option
[04:32:28] <xe0n> Impact of workaround This policy will block the remote attack vector by preventing inbound remote printing operations. The system will no longer function as a print server, but local printing to a directly attached device will still be possible.
[04:34:05] <Work-BWMerlin> I did that via GPO and users have reported the printers stopped working.  Yes I did email them that I had done that and yes they did read it because they told me they read it

[04:39:36] <xe0n> SILLY
[04:39:40] <xe0n> that's so silly
[04:39:43] <xe0n> no wonder nothing works
[04:40:05] <Work-BWMerlin> Print server also restarts daily because of some odd issue (haven't looked into) where the print server software (uniflow) crashes
[04:40:20] <xe0n> thats nothing to do with you applying a gpo at the root and applying it to _all_ machines

[07:53:09] <xe0n> hence you follow the posted mitigrations microsoft has said - disable (if possible) the print spooler on machines that dont require it (dcs, member servers) or set the option to disable servers\workstations to accept remote printer jobs except on the machines that are required to (print servers)
[07:53:19] <xe0n> attaching a gpo to the root ofy our domain disabling whatever is going to break things :P

[09:58:12] <A-KO> when attempting to remove them from a house?
[09:58:14] <A-KO> whole truck blew up
[09:58:17] <A-KO> injured like 17 poeople or some shit

[09:59:51] <A-KO> ^
[09:59:52] <A-KO> do it
[10:00:22] <CableNinja> I WFH so I dont have to drive to work every day, but I would do 110-105-405-La Cienega

[10:00:44] <A-KO> my commute is 405 -> 110 -> 105 -> Crenshaw
[10:01:20] <A-KO> I could take El Segundo instead of the loop around on the 105 and Crenshaw; but it's a toss up as to which one is going to suck worse each morning
[10:01:25] <A-KO> sometimes 105W sucks asshole
[10:01:29] <A-KO> sometimes El Segundo sucks ass

[10:01:46] <xe0n> share a subway
[10:01:48] <xe0n> and a coke

[10:06:03] <CableNinja> xe0n, no, my cameras broken
[10:06:08] <xe0n> oh no
[10:06:19] <A-KO> I hear Palomar is cool to camp at but I would imagine not a great place to go during the summer
[10:06:45] <CableNinja> its an alright area. I havent gone camping up there, but the park area is actually really small and not that great
[10:06:57] <xe0n> makeout point?
[10:07:16] <CableNinja> and its still close enough to the casinos that you can hear the concerts
[10:07:23] <CableNinja> so its not the ideal quiet place
[10:07:43] <CableNinja> xe0n, theres many more close places than there lol, could get laid 3 times in the time it takes to drive there heh

[10:10:10] <CableNinja> riff-IRC, eh, I'd thought about it, but its expensive up there, and with amazon basically having taken over seattle, I'd definitely rather not

[23:50:04] <sd> 14<D​ylan> I wanted to use the Windows VM on a Linux machine. Mostly for convenience. I could try to run Windows services with Wine but I'm not sure if this is going to work
[23:50:04] <sd> 14<D​ylan> On Linux my first suggestion was VirtualBox
[23:50:29] <JollyRgrs> can't domain join the free hyper-v, so you gotta invest more time to manage it
[23:50:44] <JollyRgrs> @Dylan when you say task sequence, what is driving the OSD? MDT?
[23:51:12] <sd> 14<D​ylan> What I'm unsure about it the gRPC part. Node balancing is not really necessary with 2 clients I suppsoe
[23:51:16] <sd> 11<H​otmess> pretty sure you can domain join the hosts
[23:51:30] <sd> 14<D​ylan> Yeah exactly
[23:51:31] <JollyRgrs> @Hotmess not the Hyper-V (free version) server
[23:52:00] <JollyRgrs> @Dylan there are some .ini files (I forget exact location) that you can stuff all the options and make it a zero touch install
[23:52:01] <sd> 11<H​otmess> you usally just pay for the sla for it
