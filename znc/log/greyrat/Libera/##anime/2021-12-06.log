[00:00:40] * ImoutoBot welcomes F​enderbassist (10 / 26): <F​enderbassist> KaffeeJunky123: it's true that you don't need a permission slip to be alive, you can just Be
[00:00:45] <Fenderbassist> that
[00:19:22] <mathu> Nanobot: i thought i remembered 57k or something being some magic number at which you'd sell and retire?
[00:19:41] <isekaijin> He said 125k the last time I checked.
[00:20:14] <mathu> i am not around much, i could be misremembering or it could have changed from a year ago
[00:21:21] <mathu> Nanobot: what's the price where if you sold you could retire? is that 100k or is that just bc you're confident you could make more
[00:22:57] <Nanobot> mathu: The $57k figure might have been the point where the typical returns of stock indexes would give me the same income I make from my day job. I wouldn't feel comfortable retiring on that, though. I also want a healthy amount of money for other investments like bitcoin.
[00:24:01] <mathu> i c i c
[00:24:46] <mathu> i hope you can cash out before a bubble pops or regulators intervene or whatever
[00:25:57] <Nanobot> If I don't do any more trading except selling all of my bitcoins at $100k, that would leave me enough money to invest enough in stock indexes (assuming a 10.8% annual return and 4% inflation rate) to make the same income I currently make from my day job, plus about half a million dollars for other investments, plus $100k in the bank for rainy days.
[00:27:03] <Nanobot> If bitcoin doesn't reach that price this cycle, then I'll have to wait for the next one. That's why I didn't quit my day job yet.
[00:28:32] <Nanobot> My plan was actually to sell enough of my bitcoin at $100k to cover the index investments and bank savings, and then to sell fractions of my remaining bitcoins at 125%, 150%, and 200% if it gets that high.
[00:28:53] <Nanobot> Er, $125k, $150k, and $200k
[00:28:59] <mathu> how confident are you that bitcoin will hit 100k
[00:29:20] <Nanobot> Eventually? I'm pretty confident. In this cycle? Dunno.
[00:29:28] <mathu> you'd stake your retirement on it?
[00:29:53] <mathu> regulatory attention won't threaten your plan?
[00:30:35] <mathu> or other factors
[00:31:05] <mathu> it's not news i don't like cryptocurrency by the spirit of the question here is you're someone i don't want to get fucked by a meltdown
[00:31:07] <Nanobot> Whatever retirement money I have is mainly a result of my trading. I simply can't retire on the money I have right now. I need to grow it more, and bitcoin is my vehicle to do that.
[00:31:20] <mathu> s/by/but/
[00:32:58] <mathu> yeah i get that but i mean, like, a more risk-averse plan would be to start selling at 60, 70, 80. that'd still be retireable, right? you'd just have less money for what would amount to a trading hobby since you'd ahve non-volatile assets for living off of?
[00:33:32] <Nanobot> I have very little confidence in the stock market, though. I think it's in a bubble of its own.
[00:33:48] <mathu> sure, but there are bonds, land, simple savings accounts

[00:34:16] <ImoutoBot> Urchin[emacs]: tsunderenoises was last seen in ##anime 1 day and 20 hours ago: <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: my mailman really likes to leave cardboard boxes under where the water drips off the roof when it's raining, on rainy days
[00:34:33] <Nanobot> Bonds and savings accounts don't really make money anymore. I haven't looked at land recently, but that's been going through bubbles, too.
[00:34:56] <mathu> but if you have enough non-volatile assets to retire on, how important is making more money
[00:35:16] <Bco1981> need to atleast follow inflation
[00:35:50] <mathu> sure, i guess
[00:36:10] <Nanobot> Absolutely important. If I were to cash out and just keep that money in a bank or under my pillow, it wouldn't last me more than a couple of decades. My entire retirement plan is based on investing it somewhere and living off the annual returns. To do that, I need enough money to yield those returns.
[00:36:28] <Nanobot> And if the stock market has a few bad years at the start of my retirement, I'm 100% screwed.
[00:36:47] <mathu> i see
[00:38:01] <mathu> again the spirit of the question is i don't want you to get fucked. not trying to challenge your plan or anything, though i sort of am doing that anyway haha

[00:38:37] * ImoutoBot welcomes h​assoon (1 / 7): <nullifidian> h​assoon you like to ask prying questions, don't you? <h​assoon> nullifidian: yep <h​assoon> nullifidian: and the best part of it is...getting the answer

[00:39:38] <markon101> How is it going everyone?
[00:39:42] <markon101> Hope it is going well
[00:39:48] <hassoon> depends on everyone
[00:39:57] <Nanobot> Well, this is why I haven't invested more than I can afford to lose. If all of my bitcoins vanish overnight, I'll still have enough money in the bank to pay taxes on the earning I make (I wouldn't be able to claim losses on those bitcoins, unfortunately) and still have about $150k in the bank, plus my house which I fully own.
[00:40:14] <Nanobot> *earnings I made
[00:40:21] <markon101> That is smart Nanobot
[00:40:27] <markon101> I mine a little
[00:40:41] *** Quits: imdoor (~imdoor@balticom-142-78-50.balticom.lv) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:41:25] <mathu> Nanobot: that's good, at least. i imagine that would leave you with no path to retirement tho
[00:41:29] <Nanobot> I don't mine, because it wouldn't be profitable. Unless you have a significant commercial mining operation in a place where electricity is particularly cheap, it's financially smarter to just buy bitcoins on the market rather than try to mine them.
[00:42:15] <markon101> Yes it is a good idea to just buy BTC I mine ETH because it is still profitable
[00:42:19] <mathu> my retirement plan is a 401k, a post-tax market account, and some plain-jane savings accounts
[00:42:21] <Nanobot> mathu: I wouldn't be able to retire within a few years, no. But I could invest that $150k somewhere and let it grow so that I could retire when I'm an old fart.
[00:43:08] <mathu> Nanobot: fair enough, if you've been this successful with btc i have to assume that plan would work for you
[00:43:53] <mathu> i am due to sit down with a munny guy and move some numbers around between spreadsheets
[00:44:14] <mathu> i have been putting it off and i think parts of my setup are pretty suboptimal as a result
[00:44:50] <Bco1981> here, if you have more then $15K in the bank. YOU pay interest to the bank...
[00:45:02] <Nanobot> Savings accounts typically lose money over time. Unless you're earning more than 4% annually on those accounts, it isn't keeping up with inflation. 401k generally underperforms the stock market, as do money market accounts.
[00:45:04] <mathu> but my attitude is my job makes me enough munny that i can afford not to stress about being optimal. i don't currently intend to retire in my 30s
[00:45:24] *** Quits: masticass (~gzc@host-85-201-222-202.dynamic.voo.be) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[00:45:57] <Nanobot> The upside of those low-yield accounts is that they are hopefully more stable than the stock market. However, the inflation rate itself has been horribly unstable the last couple of years.
[00:46:02] <isekaijin> Bco1981: How does that make sense?
[00:46:24] <Bco1981> idk, the bank just wants to make money.
[00:46:25] <mathu> i think i just check the boxes on the websites that say "put the munny in automatically-managed s&p500 index funds"
[00:46:46] <mathu> my 401k provider has a "risk tolerance" slider and i think mine is fairly conservative
[00:47:23] <mathu> or maybe a target retirement age slider and i didn't put it as early as some of my peers. i don't remember, i last touched those settings a few years ago
[00:48:43] <mathu> i might buy a house or condo in the next few years for, like, life reasons, and i suppose that is also an asset

[00:50:49] <Cryowolf> mathu, no, I know that one but no :P
[00:51:02] <isekaijin> Bco1981: No, what I mean is, like, why would anyone save their money in the bank if you have to pay them money to do so?
[00:51:19] <markon101> Stability maybe
[00:51:33] <Bco1981> idk
[00:51:37] <mathu> oh Nanobot one more question: are your btc at risk of compromise in a hack? there's been a spree of them lately
[00:51:51] <Bco1981> it's awful. you can't save up like this.
[00:51:52] <Cryowolf> isekaijin, maybe if the world was like apocalyptic or post-apocalyptic and a bank is the only safe place. But being that, they need to protect it with all they got
[00:51:56] <Cryowolf> 'and youre paying for that
[00:52:36] <Nanobot> mathu: They're in my personal wallet on my own hardware, and I'm very careful about its security.
[00:53:31] <markon101> That is smart as well

[01:16:07] <Cryowolf> -16 is alright
[01:16:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's around -25 it starts to get a bit annoying.
[01:17:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Wearing appropriate facewear mitigates most of the annoyance, although thinking about your budget after the purchase brings the annoyance back.
[01:17:11] <Cryowolf> well it's most annoying around +4 to -5 when it's humid
[01:17:14] <Cryowolf> and unstable

[02:30:26] <Satin> you are a poot
[02:30:30] * MootPoot slaps satin
[02:30:31] <ButterNoodle> kinda like the mcarthy era where everyone thought everyone else was a communist sympathizer
[02:30:33] <Fenderbassist> ButterNoodle: pick up a bass guitar, you'll have more friends than you'll know what to do with
[02:30:40] <MootPoot> Satin: ur my ex wife
[02:30:46] <Fenderbassist> "we need a bass player, no one can find one"
[02:30:48] <ButterNoodle> but now its - people of the other political opinion
[02:30:55] <ButterNoodle> lol
[02:31:01] <ButterNoodle> everyone has a bass in their basement tho
[02:31:06] <MootPoot> ass*
[02:31:13] <Jigsy> Bass Guitar fishing.
[02:31:24] <Fenderbassist> makes a fine anchor for fishing boat
[02:31:29] <ButterNoodle> Bass Guitar Fingering
[02:32:00] <ButterNoodle> if ur a gud fingerer on the basssss she know u got dem good magic fingers
[02:32:03] <ButterNoodle> for counting money
[02:32:08] <ButterNoodle> and screwing in light bulbs
[02:32:14] <ButterNoodle> and fixin cars
[02:32:27] <ButterNoodle> probably choppin vegetables too
[02:33:15] <ButterNoodle> I should get out my amp and guitar so I can annoy the neighbors
[02:33:45] <Terminus> i'm amused how big of a boogieman communism still is in the US. americans are the only people i hear about who're still like "communism bad!"
[02:33:45] <ButterNoodle> I would need a cabinet with a few 15"s to get the same effect out of a bass tho
[02:34:05] <Fenderbassist> Fender Rumble 15 cabs and a Rumble head
[02:34:08] <Fenderbassist> is what I use
[02:34:09] <ButterNoodle> Terminus: yea cause its been squashed out everywhere else - except china
[02:34:23] <Fenderbassist> Class D, light but sounds like an Ampeg B15
[02:34:38] <Satin> MootPoot: wth
[02:34:41] <Fenderbassist> I have a single 15 combo, and dual cabs with main and backup heads
[02:34:45] <Terminus> except people generally understand that china pretends to be communist but kinda isn't really.
[02:34:45] <MootPoot> I want to finger a cute girl
[02:34:46] <ButterNoodle> woof
[02:35:07] <MootPoot> Satin: get bulli
[02:35:11] <ButterNoodle> Terminus: yea its what communism eventually turns into in order to survive
[02:35:13] <MootPoot> :P
[02:35:14] * Satin pats MootPoot 
[02:35:20] <Terminus> MootPoot: step 1 find cute girl. step 2 actually talk to cute girl without coming off like a creep.
[02:35:29] <MootPoot> step 2 is hard
[02:35:37] <ButterNoodle> a police state that controls the people that control the means of production
[02:35:38] <Terminus> stop being a creep. kek
[02:35:41] <MootPoot> I can do step 2
[02:35:42] <MootPoot> but
[02:35:49] <MootPoot> I cant do step 2 in a relationship building sense
[02:36:01] <MootPoot> if all I do is talk factually about things
[02:36:05] <ButterNoodle> u never know what kinda girl u gonna get when u walk up and just smell their hair
[02:36:05] <Terminus> stop thinking about it in a relationship building sense at all. just don't be a creep.
[02:36:18] <ButterNoodle> sometimes u get arrested
[02:36:23] <MootPoot> like think of it like  this
[02:36:28] <MootPoot> Terminus: you are now a cute girl
[02:36:36] * ButterNoodle sniffs Terminus
[02:36:51] <ButterNoodle> oh damn
[02:36:55] <MootPoot> if I talk to you like "hi whats up with class, or do you need X or Y , or if I need X for class/work etc" 
[02:37:00] <ButterNoodle> I gotta go, I have a windows 2003 install to tend to
[02:37:02] <MootPoot> I can be a complete normie like that
[02:37:11] <MootPoot> but I have no idea how to go from that

[02:38:14] <Satin> i'm curious how other irc clients treat emojis
[02:38:22] <Fenderbassist> :)

[02:38:33] <ImoutoBot> [image/png] 108kB
[02:38:42] <Satin> what client do you use
[02:38:44] <Satin> irccloud/
[02:38:45] <Satin> ?
[02:38:45] <Terminus> i mean, i broke up with my ex, decided that i'm better off being single and i don't need to be in a relationship, then i meet a girl and i know i'll regret it for the rest of my life if i don't try to date her. i end up in a relationship again anyway. XD
[02:38:50] <MootPoot> I will save this forever
[02:38:53] <MootPoot> to torment you
[02:38:55] <ButterNoodle> its the hells canyon long range.. normally 1200 - got it for 1050~ and a $100 rebate
[02:39:00] <Satin> Terminus: heh
[02:39:06] <Satin> MootPoot: no.
[02:39:10] <MootPoot> heh
[02:39:12] <MootPoot> you posted it
[02:39:28] <ButterNoodle> Fenderbassist: planning to do some long range hunting this next fall :)
[02:39:28] <Terminus> Satin: jesus. were you describing yourself? 😅
[02:39:28] <MootPoot> 90% of the crap I say online is for the memes
[02:39:41] <MootPoot> I dont think I'd be able to pull off saying anything like
[02:39:43] <MootPoot> !quote
[02:39:43] <ImoutoBot> MootPoot: (123 / 143) <M​ootPoot> I'd prefer if we HAVE to deal with this crap - deal with only one general neutral terminology vs 500 pronouns
[02:39:46] <Satin> 90% of the crap you think is for the memes too
[02:39:46] * ButterNoodle sounds like a normal human being irl

[02:39:58] <Satin> Terminus: no, mootpoot called you a cute girl so I went for it
[02:40:02] <MootPoot> why am I getting all the non-ecchi quotes now
[02:40:04] <ButterNoodle> I also look like one

[02:40:16] <MootPoot> I dont say that shit irl
[02:40:17] <MootPoot> lol
[02:40:21] <Satin> better not be
[02:40:28] <Satin> :weirdpepe:
[02:40:32] <MootPoot> Satin: if you saw me irl you'd probably think I'm a boring normie/loser
[02:40:37] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: emojis here are in black & white
[02:40:39] <MootPoot> and proceed on with your day
[02:40:40] <Satin> i don't have judgements about most people irl
[02:40:43] <ButterNoodle> I do to people that -know- me
[02:40:44] <Terminus> MootPoot: it's easy. you say "i'd love to have coffee with you. when are you free?" doesn't have to be more complicated than that.
[02:40:46] <Urchin[emacs]> Satin: which is an improvement over the old versions of Emacs
[02:40:52] <Satin> Urchin[emacs]: lol
[02:40:54] <MootPoot> Terminus:  what
[02:40:59] <MootPoot> that sounds too cool for me to do
[02:41:11] <Satin> Terminus: he only talks to girls thousands of miles away on discord
[02:41:17] <Satin> :concern:
[02:41:22] <Satin> so that doesn't quite work
[02:41:39] <Terminus> Satin: apparently. 😐
[02:41:53] <Satin> MootPoot: download dating apps or something
[02:41:58] <ButterNoodle> I wish irssi wouldnt cut off the emojis from ircv3
[02:42:04] <MootPoot> HAHAH
[02:42:05] <MootPoot> no
[02:42:16] <ButterNoodle> maybe my terminal client
[02:42:18] <Satin> discord is worse for such endevours and you know it
[02:42:19] <MootPoot> Satin: you want me to not only be alone, but suicidal AND alone?
[02:42:24] <Satin> wtf?
[02:42:31] <MootPoot> I dont try to date on disord
[02:42:31] <Satin> why would dating apps make u sucicidal
[02:42:32] <MootPoot> lol
[02:42:35] <Terminus> i take forever choosing emojis. i still have to get the hang of using emojis in a terminal. 😅
[02:42:39] <Satin> then what are you trying
[02:42:40] <Satin> at all
[02:42:46] <Satin> and complaining after trying on irc
[02:42:47] <MootPoot> Satin: the only people who get hits on dating apps
[02:42:54] <MootPoot> are attractive people 
[02:42:57] <Satin> MootPoot: with that mindset you'll get nowhere
[02:43:00] <Terminus> ButterNoodle: i'm using irssi right now and i'm sending emoji with it.
[02:43:03] <Satin> just treat it as a potential line to try
[02:43:08] <Satin> jeebus
[02:43:09] <MootPoot> I tried it
[02:43:10] <MootPoot> once
[02:43:13] <MootPoot> 0  hits
[02:43:17] <MootPoot> for a month
[02:43:20] <MootPoot> then I deleted it
[02:43:21] <MootPoot> lol
[02:43:56] <Satin> what did you try
[02:44:05] <MootPoot> what you just said
[02:44:07] <MootPoot> made a profile
[02:44:10] <MootPoot> on a dating site
[02:44:10] <Satin> on what apps
[02:44:11] <ButterNoodle> Terminus: then its my terminal Terminus :|
[02:44:11] <MootPoot> no work
[02:44:18] <MootPoot> ;(
[02:44:24] <MootPoot> satin is trying to dox me butter
[02:44:25] <MootPoot> help
[02:44:27] <Terminus> wait for covid to stop being a thing, go to bar, talk to girls.
[02:44:35] <MootPoot> Terminus: what if I dont drink
[02:44:40] <Satin> MootPoot: start drinking
[02:44:44] <MootPoot> dont wanna
[02:44:49] <MootPoot> I dont like the idea
[02:44:51] <Satin> you can have a little
[02:44:52] <Terminus> ButterNoodle: i just use gnome-terminal. default settings.
[02:44:52] <Satin>  ok
[02:45:00] <Terminus> well, i did change terminal size.
[02:45:04] <ButterNoodle> I use securecrt
[02:45:09] <ButterNoodle> probably encoding
[02:45:17] <MootPoot> :<
[02:45:18] <Terminus> MootPoot: get a hobby, go to social event about your hobby, talk to girls.
[02:45:24] <MootPoot> Satin: have you had a bf before
[02:45:26] <Terminus> ButterNoodle: utf-8 all the things
[02:45:29] <MootPoot> how did it  happen
[02:45:33] <MootPoot> did he ask you
[02:45:44] <Satin> I have
[02:45:56] <ButterNoodle> send another
[02:45:58] <MootPoot> did you tell him to install linux
[02:45:58] <Satin> first online
[02:46:01] <Satin>  yes
[02:46:04] <MootPoot> lol
[02:46:05] <Satin> kappa
[02:46:07] <Satin> pride
[02:46:18] <Satin> but idk i haven't had a very long serious relationship irl
[02:46:43] <Satin> i'm quite alright being single right now :D

[02:46:49] *** Joins: hellstabber (~hellstabb@178.233.16.12)
[02:46:56] <Satin> lasted for a few months
[02:46:56] <MootPoot> did you just do what Terminus said
[02:47:09] <Satin> no, i grew up in a very different setup from that stuff
[02:47:15] <MootPoot> well I mean you are in uni still so
[02:47:15] <Satin> controlling southern baptist family
[02:47:17] <Satin> that i had to work around
[02:47:17] <MootPoot> ah
[02:47:28] <Satin> but i did meet ppl, friend of a friend sometimes
[02:47:41] <Satin> but i don't think that counts much either ways, in my case I'm somewhat in the same positon as you
[02:48:13] <Satin> except i have a bit of experience, and life stuff like getting shot and being semi mentally ill and my last sort of ex being crazy has turned me off
[02:48:27] <Satin> so i have no desire or longing for a relationship at this time
[02:48:30] <Terminus> i first talked to my gf on irc but i didn't think about dating her at all. only got interested in her when the channel had a party at a bar and i got to talk to her IRL.
[02:48:42] <Satin> Terminus: nice
[02:49:00] <Satin> that's good that you were able to befriend her on irc first without any intentions of dating from the start or whatever too
[02:49:09] <MootPoot> soon satin will create her own  husbando
[02:49:17] <MootPoot> husbando linux
[02:49:26] <Satin> Terminus: myrl has got a wife too, they're so cute 
[02:49:27] <Terminus> also, when i got to the party i was like "who's this girl with 10 guys around her trying to talk to her?" 😅
[02:49:32] <Satin> with them
[02:49:34] <Satin> it seems
[02:49:42] <Satin> Terminus: lol
[02:49:49] <Terminus> Satin: wait, myrl actually got married? like actually married and not just gf?
[02:49:50] <MootPoot> Terminus: you know
[02:49:56] <MootPoot> that actually happened once to me
[02:49:59] <Satin> Terminus: nah not married, but they mgiht as well in some years i bet
[02:49:59] <MootPoot> you know what I did
[02:50:01] <MootPoot> I thought
[02:50:11] <Satin> but they call her their wife so
[02:50:16] <Terminus> Satin: where does myrl hang out nowadays? i lost track of him here and on discord.
[02:50:21] <MootPoot> "damn this girl is getting crowded , I guess I'm gonna chill here on a table alone rather then crowd her further"
[02:50:34] <MootPoot> and thats exactly what I did
[02:50:42] <Satin> I don't know either, they talk in a discord server I have sometimes
[02:50:45] <Satin> and I dm them once in a while
[02:50:57] <Satin> idk where else they've moved to, seems they lost a lot of interest in irc
[02:51:01] <Satin> they're def on twitter lol
[02:51:03] <Terminus> MootPoot: i did the same thing except i kept on looking for an opportunity to talk to her. we ended up with drunken talk about FFTs.
[02:51:33] <Terminus> Satin: ah... thanks. found him a long time ago on the thinkpad discord. rather, he messaged me and told me he was myrl. lol
[02:51:40] <Satin> lmao
[02:51:51] <Satin> myrl and old laptops, timeless combination
[02:52:08] <Satin> Terminus: i remember you and myrl talking about girls and dating
[02:52:11] <Satin> years ago
[02:52:14] <Satin> burned into my irc memories
[02:52:42] <Terminus> bet myrl is still doing stuff with nixos. 😁
[02:52:55] <Satin> lmao probably
[02:53:27] <Satin> ugh i might try a modal editor and change all the keybindings to COLEMAK
[02:53:31] <Terminus> Satin: lol i usually just talk bullshit about dating. at least i think of it as bullshit. just that sometimes it works. 😁
[02:53:42] <Satin> :p i get that
[02:53:56] <isekaijin> Satin: Just pick an arbitrary editor and try it out.
[02:53:57] <MootPoot> online
[02:54:01] <Satin> isekaijin: nno
[02:54:04] <isekaijin> Trial and error works better than anything else.
[02:54:05] <MootPoot> I think half the problem
[02:54:09] <MootPoot> is that I have no friends irl
[02:54:12] <isekaijin> At least for this kind of thing.
[02:54:12] <MootPoot> anymore
[02:54:17] <MootPoot> ever since I moved 
[02:54:18] <Satin>  I'm super picky hmph
[02:54:30] <Satin> MootPoot: don't be isolated, be involved
[02:54:33] <MootPoot> how
[02:54:35] <MootPoot> like
[02:54:38] <Satin> even if it's things unrelated to friends and dating
[02:54:38] <MootPoot> legit
[02:54:43] <isekaijin> Satin: Yes, being picky is good. But there is no way you can know what your picky tastes will actually prefer until you try things out.
[02:54:52] <Terminus> colemak... at one point i considered moving to workman-p but i was too lazy to actually install the layout. i just use dvp now.
[02:54:58] <Satin> dvp = ?
[02:55:10] <Satin> sub-type of dovrak?
[02:55:24] <Terminus> Satin: yeah. dvorak programmer.
[02:55:38] <MootPoot> Get involved  in things ->  the expensive things we have
[02:55:41] <hassoon> who the heck is dvorak
[02:55:41] <MootPoot> aihduiswaniudansiu
[02:55:43] <MootPoot> me
[02:55:47] <MootPoot> but anyway
[02:55:51] <Terminus> it's easier for me to stick with dvorak subsets
[02:55:55] <MootPoot> it seems like there is nothing to get involved in
[02:56:05] <hassoon> dvorak is a keyboard layout afaik
[02:56:27] <Terminus> MootPoot: get friends. find online community in your area, organize party night or something.
[02:56:27] <MootPoot> unless either you have the bar of entry being too high
[02:56:45] <MootPoot> get friends is like asking me to be rich
[02:56:54] <MootPoot> except being rich sounds more feasible
[02:57:09] <Satin> MootPoot: u need to drop the mindset of making excuses to yourself
[02:57:14] <Terminus> i haven't really seen friends in a few years but we still keep in touch occassionally. means when we do meet, it's not awkward.
[02:57:15] <isekaijin> Being rich is not that hard, you just have to be rich.
[02:57:15] <Satin> and being so concerned with whether it'll work or not
[02:57:44] <Satin> MootPoot: literally just start trying. Join a local wherever you live Canadian town/city discord.
[02:57:55] <Satin> Look for community events in your area that seem to be closer to people your age.
[02:58:04] <Terminus> hell, i have a friend who's a neighbor and i still don't see him. instead, i see him at tech meetups. 😅
[02:58:11] <Satin> And bumble has a friends app feature as well
[02:58:13] <Satin> go look into that
[02:58:17] <Satin> Terminus: lmao

[04:27:20] <Satin> cryptocurrency is full of snake oil peddling

[04:28:05] <Satin> it's not that the tech is useless or uninteresting
[04:28:11] <Satin> but it hasn't proven itself at all to what it's promised to be, and it all works because people keep pouring money into it
[04:28:24] <Satin> turns out, even things based on lies and smokescreen and technobabble still works if everyone is onboard with it
[04:28:28] <listen_ers> but you arent free of selling yours tho
[04:28:28] <Satin> (for now)
[04:28:32] <listen_ers> you have to wait

[04:48:03] <listen_ers> fedora supports aarch64 so its viable (and silverblue)

[04:49:03] <listen_ers> in 2018 arm said theyll match intel in 2020
[04:49:25] <listen_ers> im not sure about that haha
[04:49:46] <listen_ers> i heard a sheeva plug 1.5 ghz in equivalent to 500 mhz p3

[04:50:14] <MootPoot> well
[04:50:16] <MootPoot> I mean
[04:50:21] <MootPoot> listen_ers: the apple M1 is a thing
[04:50:34] <listen_ers> people knew apple was dumping x86 for arm
[04:50:56] <MootPoot> what does that have to do with anything
[04:51:01] <listen_ers> im not sure
[04:51:08] <listen_ers> but the graphics developer owns one
[04:51:15] <listen_ers> so that means that its going to be a beast
[04:51:19] <MootPoot> they managed to match or at least become in the similar tier of performance with the m1
[04:51:29] <MootPoot> so arm did in fact match intel in 2020
[04:51:34] <listen_ers> and that marcon guy too
[04:51:42] <listen_ers> so i dont know they love learning that stuff
[04:51:49] <klaxa> >match
[04:52:00] <klaxa> you do realize that m1 outperforms i9s?
[04:52:12] <klaxa> depending on the workload of course
[04:52:20] <listen_ers> you have to use linux on a chromebook keyboards settings arent even reliable and thats for sure unacceptable
[04:52:34] <klaxa> but funnily enough even some jit-compiled x86_64 code runs faster on arm than natively
[04:52:40] <listen_ers> like they gutted it in chromeos that you cant fix it
[04:53:01] <listen_ers> but the graphics binary blob is suppose to be the catch
[04:53:26] <listen_ers> tho old news cause the official open source driver is the official driver

[04:58:38] <klaxa> you may not appreciate it as much as others, but it did set amazing benchmarks in terms of efficiency and also high IPC even iirc
[04:58:40] <MootPoot> sure, but its not a across the board winner  - congrats ,  it used 100% of what it could use to beat a nerfed chip

[05:00:20] <klaxa> it's quite the edge over the competition, you can have the same size battery and almost twice the runtime

[05:00:51] <MootPoot> low power mobile chips
[05:01:02] <klaxa> what i heard from devs is that builds are a lot faster than on old mac books

[05:01:19] <MootPoot> yes, to other macbooks -> other low power mobile chips
[05:01:24] <MootPoot> its really cool within its bracket

[05:01:52] <MootPoot> but overall its not going to make a 32 core threadripper or something obsolete
[05:02:00] <klaxa> i think it's obvious though that bigger chips are coming and this is the first generation anyway
[05:02:24] <klaxa> maybe not now, but it could very much so in the not-so-distant future
[05:02:26] <MootPoot> we will see - we've never seen a properly large scale arm chip to date and we dont even know if apple gives a shit about that
[05:02:45] <klaxa> yeah, but some data-centers have also switched to arm already
[05:02:48] <MootPoot> apple wants a unified chip for its own stuff - which is largely low power consumer grade computers
[05:02:54] <MootPoot> klaxa: niche stuff - ask ButterNoodle 
[05:02:56] <klaxa> but i agree most internet shit is still x86_64
[05:03:03] <MootPoot> like I have a m1 air as well
[05:03:21] <MootPoot> but outside of ultrathin and mobile computers - its a big meh
[05:03:39] <klaxa> yes, because it was designed for low power mobile
[05:03:49] <klaxa> but if you scale up the design for high power server
[05:03:56] <MootPoot> if its possible*
[05:04:01] <klaxa> you get tremendous energy savings compared to x86_64
[05:04:03] <MootPoot> and apple wont give a shit about that

[05:17:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That however depends on how the air intakes & outakes are made.
[05:18:11] <ButterNoodle> neither actually filter

[05:23:17] <ButterNoodle> Terminus: how do they vape?
[05:23:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The thing is that without air sterilization rigs inside the building's ventilation, masks quickly become useless.
[05:23:41] <ButterNoodle> do they nose dick (thanks Satin) and snort fruit loop flavored vape?
[05:23:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I also still don't get why UV air sterilization isn't standard in building ventilation HVAC.
[05:23:52] <Terminus> ButterNoodle: they don't. vaping indoors is not a thing ever since the pandemic started.
[05:24:07] <Terminus> it's just a place to buy supplies. take them home, vape at home.

[05:25:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Pretty effective if they're powerful enough.
[05:25:26] <ButterNoodle> and now the maintenance risks of HVAC.. touching contaminated filters
[05:25:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Sufficient UV radiation basically denatures and burns out most organic stuff.
[05:25:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Oh, you mean HVAC bio-rated filters?
[05:25:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's a different thing.
[05:25:57] <ButterNoodle> both ofc
[05:26:10] <ButterNoodle> u need regular filters for the normal contaminates

[06:58:22] <Satin> Terminus: makes sense!
[06:58:38] <Terminus> Satin: no. i don't bother installing vim on servers. vi OTOH is always installed by default.
[06:58:47] <Satin> i see aha
[06:59:47] <amigojapan> That is the main reason why learning vi is a must, cause it may be the only text editor available
[07:00:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ed & vi may be the only editors available on oldass obsolete systems.
[07:00:18] <Satin> amigojapan: this is 2021
[07:00:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> On the other hand, you can also just use Emacs & TRAMP to edit files locally and push them back remotely.
[07:00:34] <Terminus> my freshly installed raspbian bullseye only has vi. no vim.
[07:01:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Terminus: Debian by default only provides vi pre-installed. You can and should add zile or emacs-mg.
[07:01:13] <Terminus> also, i just do everything in containers nowadays. my host system doesn't have compilers. i build in a container.

[07:04:05] <sentionics> I'm ok with Vim. That said. I'll use VS Code whenever possible. And even better, if you need scripts on a remote server, utilize rsync, or that not being available for whatever reason, there's LFTP
[07:05:21] <amigojapan> Satin: and most of the economy runs on COBOL systems that will never be upgraded
[07:05:21] <sentionics> When avoidable. Don't code directly on your remote servers. Sync your remote servers with locally coded applications.
[07:06:05] <Terminus> Satin: standard thing for me nowadays: make container for building (podman because docker sucks), use conan to deal with dependencies, use cmake for building (interoperates with conan).
[07:06:27] <Satin> amigojapan: it'll die eventually
[07:06:31] <Terminus> some people swap cmake for meson but i can't be bothered right now.
[07:06:34] <Satin> amigojapan: plus, you're listing the exceptions
[07:06:44] <Satin> amigojapan: in general the vast majority of people use vs code, xcode, and so on

[07:12:04] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: they know how to fix them too
[07:12:06] <MootPoot> but I currently do low code - no code work
[07:12:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: Of course it's also likely that the economy will suffer a hard crash long before that.
[07:12:20] <sentionics> MootPoot: lots of folks don't even need a degree to work dev jobs. I don't have a degree at all.
[07:12:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Those companies going under would get rid of the systems much faster.
[07:12:33] <sentionics> I do have 10+ years experience though.
[07:13:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: At some point spares aren't made enough.
[07:13:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Or at all.
[07:13:40] <sentionics> but lots of companies don't even half do background checks so one could potentially bullshit oneself into a senior tier position, but that risks some kind of fraud accusation I'd suspect.
[07:14:34] <MootPoot> I ordered a coconut naan and butter chicken
[07:14:57] <sentionics> I'm pretty sure I've seen job listings saying "3+ years exp" == senior level, so... if you bend what "years of exp" means, anything's possible, ha ha!

[08:10:45] <sentionics> ah, straight-up its name in this case

[08:11:36] <omero> infact I dont even have netcat on my system
[08:11:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> socat is a bit more powerful.
[08:12:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Its interface is more obnoxious, but it's more versatile.
[08:12:07] <sentionics> ohhhh, socat can do multiple entities listening on a single port.
[08:12:34] <sentionics> connection reuse, huh.
[08:12:38] <omero> yeah, the man page of socat is ... almost ... as frightening as the manpage of lsof, Aurora_v_kosmose :)
[08:13:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's widely used in Qubes to convert from vchan-based pipes to whatever else it needs.
[08:13:49] <omero> because... it can :)
[08:14:18] <omero> good luck trying that with netcat 
[08:15:00] <omero> socat is essentially netcat ... on steroids :P
[08:16:27] <sentionics> omero: you were keen on this one! tr does the job! Just gotta pipe into it like so <stuff> | tr -d '\000

[08:35:18] <sentionics> omero: interesting dislike for C++. I personally dislike Java and C# though I used to be the supposed walking "JavaDocs" in college. Java was my first programming language in college, but after coming to love python, I've also come to loathe using it (and anything seemingly java like or simply verbose for that matter)
[08:36:22] <sentionics> I do struggle with C++ in general, as error messages aren't as kind as other langs I seem to remember, but again, I was always immature with C/C++ to begin with, so my thoughts on that are from an amateur's perspective.

[08:44:25] <blakesmith> S_T_A_N: bud
[08:44:32] <S_T_A_N> ...
[08:44:40] <sentionics> You know what, I finally just realized how to really explain what a "gotcha" is.
[08:44:54] <blakesmith> S_T_A_N: bweh
[08:45:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: You're missing one of the most versatile tooks though. A hammer.
[08:45:05] <sentionics> it's something that breaks the established patterns of intuition within a given domain.
[08:45:08] <S_T_A_N> blakesmith, you want to use words and explain your thoughts or just keep being nothing? 
[08:45:19] <ButterNoodle> Aurora_v_kosmose: can u code a hammer?
[08:45:22] <sentionics> a gotcha counters intuition.
[08:45:52] <sentionics> exceptions and intuition conflict. Hence: "gotcha"
[08:46:09] <sentionics> I've had a few drinks...
[08:46:18] <blakesmith> sentionics: *thinking up random b words*
[08:46:49] <sentionics> (sometimes I feel like I have moments while drunk that are similar to people who are stoned as hell)
[08:47:18] <amigojapan> Back
[08:47:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Hm, possibly, you could use one to make a mechanical computer.
[08:47:36] <sentionics> blakesmith: "gotcha's" is a commonly used term though, ha ha ha
[08:47:54] <sentionics> I see them from time to time in tutorials and books
[08:48:15] <sentionics> totally not a mere buzzword
[08:48:16] <blakesmith> sentionics: gotcha
[08:48:17] <ButterNoodle> just need one to mash enter
[08:48:47] <sentionics> ButterNoodle: If I mash the tab key, will it get me another beer?
[08:48:50] <blakesmith> Gotcha is the shortened form of Got Ya
[08:49:00] <sentionics> I got ya.
[08:49:13] <ButterNoodle> blakesmith: why the hell does it have an extra letter then
[08:49:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Plural.
[08:49:51] <sentionics> Maybe there's a reference to an esteemed Got-chan
[08:49:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Gotchas. Gotcha. Syllabic writing.
[08:49:59] <blakesmith> ButterNoodle: it has something to do with linguistics and how humans tend to shorten spoken words
[08:50:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There's a proper linguistic term for it.
[08:50:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm no linguist.
[08:50:10] <blakesmith> Aurora_v_kosmose: yeah
[08:50:17] <blakesmith> Can't recall atm
[08:50:32] <blakesmith> sentionics: wut??
[08:51:07] <sentionics> wut indeed, sir.

[08:52:42] <sentionics> The great and glorious Got-chan contemplated many things, netchat vs socat, spaghetti vs ramen, S_T_A_N vs Aurora_v_kosmose, and in the end, the only thing we were left with was the enigmatic slang term "gotcha". And everyone's using it.

[15:14:55] <analoq> sounds like a good product idea 
[15:16:42] <Sadale> isekaijin, I've read the first vol of the manga only. Indeed. That cat's lucky :3
[15:16:51] <Sadale> isekaijin, I wish I was the cat xD
[15:17:29] <isekaijin> I reached the point where I can't continue reading this shit anymore.
[15:17:33] <Sadale> Terminus, actually there're cheaper food here. It varies from restaurant to restaurant. And it also depends on the region. And cheaper food doesn't necessarily taste worse. :3
[15:17:38] <isekaijin> It's just too silly.
[15:18:44] <isekaijin> Also, apparently, there is outright porn in MangaDex nowadays.
[15:18:48] <Sadale> Terminus, If you're talking about Mong Kok tho (that's where we met), yes. The food's usually in the range of HK$40~70. But if you look harder, you can still find cheaper food in Mong Kok, like HK$20~30. If you grab a couple of buns from bakery as a meal, it could even get to the HK$15~HK$25 range.
[15:19:15] <Sadale> Terminus, In other places like Sham Shui Po, the food in restaurants are a bit cheaper. Maybe, I dunno, like HK$30~60?
[15:19:35] <Sadale> isekaijin, how many vol you've consumed tho?
[15:19:54] <isekaijin> I stopped in chapter 25.

[15:41:03] <senti> oh, and hi Nanobot. Amigo said your quote count is off the charts. You might want to have a doctor look at that.
[15:41:09] <Nanobot> The point of NFTs is that you can prove you own a unique digital thing. In my day, that psychological void was filled by purchasing domain names.

[15:43:17] <senti> I've stopped using aerosol deodorant. Spray on deodorant is apparently unhealthy from what I read.
[15:43:17] <Sadale> Here's another problem. IIRC you can create multiple NFTs of the same piece of asset. :/

[15:44:16] <senti> when I walk in the gas stations looking for beer, all the ladies know I'm clean.
[15:44:26] <Sadale> Nanobot, IMO bitcoin invented blockchain for a good reason. It's an awesome invention that allows a decentralized transaction system to operate. The thing I've problem with is that now that everyone's using blockchain for shit that blockchain would only bloat the shit without contributing any value of the product.
[15:44:28] <amigojapan> Jesse you get too jealous of others, that only hurts you
[15:44:32] <senti> I smell so clean. they drop they dresses.
[15:44:44] <senti> so fresh so clean.
[15:44:52] <Nanobot> Sadale: Yep. Again, I don't know the specifics of how the NFTs are currently being set up, but even if the blockchain records the ownership of a file hash, you can still modify non-meaningful bits within the file to produce the same digital asset with a different hash.
[15:45:09] <JesseDesu> what
[15:45:14] <senti> *wut
[15:45:30] <JesseDesu> none of my anime art is worth selling
[15:45:37] <Nanobot> Sadale: Yeah, the vast majority of blockchain applications are only using blockchain tech just so they can say they're using blockchain tech and impress people who don't know anything about blockchain tech.
[15:45:54] <Sadale> And then they get all those investor's money :/
[15:45:55] <senti> Jesse your stuff is good, don't knock it.
[15:46:24] <amigojapan> Jesse I saw a computer icon as a "top NFT" even I could have drawn that
[15:46:43] <Nanobot> The blockchain (and especially the way it's built) is an extremely inefficient database system that's only worth talking about because it happens to be the only way anyone has figured out to make a decentralized system like Bitcoin work.

[15:52:32] <senti> I sleep something you serve over rice?
[15:52:54] <senti> shiiit, I get served over rice once and again. Tastes good too.
[15:54:18] <Nanobot> Well, in theory, NFTs could kinda sorta make sense as a public record that's easy to prove to a court of law. In practice, courts of law will happily accept evidence of ownership with much less rigor than cryptographically verifiable timestamps. And, as you mentioned, NFTs don't even solve all of those issues; it just makes it really hard to fake a timestamp.
[15:55:49] <Nanobot> The question is... could a fully automated "court system" make use of cryptographically provable timestamps of ownership? Maybe. Unfortunately, the assets themselves are typically fungible, which kind of destroys the whole thing. Just open up the PNG in Gimp and save it again, and it suddenly has a different hash.

[17:04:05] <amigojapan> Lol that video was funny HubertFarnsworth 
[17:04:22] <isekaijin> This probably seems like a security nightmare, but is there some way to click a link on my PC and have it open an app on my phone?
[17:04:39] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: yeah, are they nemesis or rivals?
[17:05:23] <amigojapan> isekaijin: it's easier if it is an X app
[17:05:49] <isekaijin> Wait, people run X on a phone?
[17:05:58] <amigojapan> isekaijin: is your phone rooted?
[17:05:59] <HubertFarnsworth> Rivals amigojapan. Fransworth gave A once when Wernstorm was his student. They have been rivals since then.
[17:06:01] <isekaijin> No.
[17:06:09] <amigojapan> Yeah isekaijin 
[17:06:52] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: A is the best score no?
[17:07:07] <HubertFarnsworth> A+
[17:07:19] <HubertFarnsworth> Not for Wernstorm.
[17:07:47] <amigojapan> isekaijin: anyway the answer is install GNU on your phone. There is a version for non rooted phones
[17:08:00] <amigojapan> I see HubertFarnsworth 
[17:08:18] <isekaijin> amigojapan: What worries me is the possibility of being unable to use my phone as a phone.
[17:08:49] <isekaijin> amigojapan: The only time I tried to root a phone, I ended up with a better computer, which was, however, completely useless as a phone.
[17:08:57] <amigojapan> isekaijin: no as long as you don't root it, it is all just an app
[17:09:46] <amigojapan> isekaijin: there is a version of Debian for Android which does not require root. Let me look it up
[17:09:48] <HubertFarnsworth> He probably is his nemesis amigojapan. Mom is his rival I think.
[17:10:11] <amigojapan> Ah right HubertFarnsworth 
[17:10:19] <isekaijin> amigojapan: Don't worry, I will look for it myself.

[17:19:20] <omero> take the pineapples off, and I'll join you anytime on that one :)
[17:19:43] <buZz> haha no, the freshness of the pineapple aids the sharpness of jalapeno
[17:20:09] * omero giggles
[17:20:31] <omero> its also.. here pineapples cost a foot and a hand...
[17:20:40] <omero> not because they're imported

[19:11:41] <SummerSkies> but the guy that I got my marinade recipe from woudl use bourbon sometimes
[19:12:05] <JesseDesu> what does it taste like
[19:13:16] <SummerSkies> eh
[19:13:22] <SummerSkies> pretty much just a variant of the montreal blend
[19:13:32] <SummerSkies> it doesn't like change the whole steak but it's a good seasoning
[19:16:03] <Poeticode> for some reason sprite sounds real tasty rn
[19:16:55] <Jigsy> I don't really like Sprite.
[19:17:08] <JesseDesu> my breakfast soda is bang energy
[19:17:08] <Jigsy> I did in the past, but over the last decade or so, it just became really weak tasting.
[19:17:24] <Jigsy> I'd rather drink 7-up than Sprite.

[19:18:25] <TsundereNoises> I'd use alcohol as a component in a marinade rather than just marinating the steak in like a bag of bourbon
[19:18:38] <ButterNoodle> tasty
[19:18:43] <JesseDesu> well yea
[19:18:44] <Jigsy> Moonshine Steak.
[19:18:53] <TsundereNoises> but like some water, bourbon, spices, something acdic
[19:19:00] <TsundereNoises> probably lemon juice
[19:19:03] <JesseDesu> coke
[19:19:10] <ButterNoodle> cocaine
[19:19:11] <TsundereNoises> eww (but fine)

[19:20:38] <TsundereNoises> also, Evan Williams is the best cooking bourbon, imo
[19:20:44] <ButterNoodle> it is
[19:20:53] <TsundereNoises> right level of cheap but not awful
[19:20:55] <JesseDesu> i havent had evan williams this year
[19:21:03] <ButterNoodle> its probably the most flavorful bourbon for the $$
[19:21:10] <TsundereNoises> exactly!
[19:21:22] <ButterNoodle> jim beam is a cheap drinker, but too corn-ey and not enough char for cooking
[19:21:37] <JesseDesu> sear both sides 5 minutes each then 10 minutes in the oven

[20:07:38] <TsundereNoises> I'm more concerned that this whole politicization of vaccines thing will give even more life to the anti-vaxxers in other areas (which used to be mainly just anti-science hippies)

[20:23:21] <Sxem> elderly assholes have already done almost all the damage they are going to do. for the evironment, its better to kill children, who will do record setting damage to the environment per person
[20:24:24] <TsundereNoises> if you think the elderly don't do any damage, you don't pay enough attention to politics
[20:24:36] <Sxem> they only have a few years left to do damage

[20:25:17] <TsundereNoises> they won't have as much power until they themselves are old
[20:25:30] <Sxem> killing a child helps the environment about as much as killing 50 elderly
[20:25:44] <Sxem> killing children is so much more efficient

[22:06:22] <Roey> oh hey bco1981
[22:06:44] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I think if you're making anything new you should just make a gui, enough people want it and you can still have keyboard too

[22:07:47] <TsundereNoises> can vtuber professors work remotely?
[22:07:49] <Satin> TsundereNoises: that's true, but this is unlikely to go anywhere as it's a personal project from a new programmer.

[22:25:00] <emmeka> true, but the point stands
[22:25:36] <TsundereNoises> the point is, I never learned it as far as I remember
[22:25:42] <TsundereNoises> and I never had trouble with order of operations
[22:26:03] <emmeka> MootPoot it's not called that in the US, anyway
[22:26:21] <emmeka> the yankees call it PEMDAS, or something
[22:26:56] <TsundereNoises> apparently not using parentheses and using overly-literal left to right is the source of some big internet/youtube order of operations thing now
[22:27:07] <TsundereNoises> it's totally dome you guys
[22:28:10] <emmeka> I see those dumb things sometimes where it's like "99% of people can't solve for x" and it's some stupid sequence of brackets that, if anyone actually wrote anything that way, would be poorly written math
[22:28:21] <Smeef> Was the dress really black and blue, or was it actually gold and white?
[22:29:02] <Smeef> Somebody use a spectroscope!
[22:29:14] <TsundereNoises> the one that's getting me is the 3x/2y thing where people are claiming you should evaluate as (3x/2)y
[22:29:15] <Smeef> I need those frequencies!
[22:29:22] <TsundereNoises> like if that's your standard than your standard is dumb
[22:29:26] <TsundereNoises> I don't care what wolfram does
[22:29:34] <TsundereNoises> for human math that's ridiculous
[22:29:56] <TsundereNoises> Smeef: and it was gold!
[22:30:30] <emmeka> (3x/3)y and 3x/2y should produce the same result though so who cares
[22:30:40] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Great Teacher Onizuka | Episode: E05
[22:30:47] <emmeka> err, (3x/2)y
[22:32:01] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I mean (3x)/(2y) vs ((3x)/2)y
[22:32:14] <emmeka> yes, those will both give the same answer.
[22:33:59] <emmeka> you can do multiplication and division in combination in any order and it doesn't matter.
[22:35:40] <TsundereNoises> I know that
[22:36:25] <emmeka> so let em. if that's what works for their brains it's k
[22:37:57] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: (3*2)/(2*4) = 3/4; ((3*2)/2)*4 = 12
[22:38:00] <TsundereNoises> that's what I mean
[22:39:02] <TsundereNoises> this isn't just a "both methods work the same" thing
[22:39:13] <TsundereNoises> it's dumb and shouldn't matter
[22:39:31] <TsundereNoises> but people are using an ambiguous expression and interpreting it differently
[22:39:36] <TsundereNoises> that's what poot was talking about
[22:39:49] <TsundereNoises> or at least what I found when I looked up the dumb acronyms
[22:40:36] <TsundereNoises> it's a computer standard vs human standard thing, and now apparently we've collectively decided that the computer standard is "correct"
[22:40:51] *** Joins: redstarcomrade (uid99592@user/redstarcomrade)
[22:41:23] <Bco1981> but, wasn't the computer standard made by human.
[22:41:28] <TsundereNoises> yes
[22:42:24] <TsundereNoises> the way that's easier to program shouldn't be what we should teach in school textbooks, or what random people on the internet should make a big deal of people being wrong about is all I mean
[22:44:46] <emmeka> TsundereNoises well that's just reading it wrong.
[22:45:09] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: your "those will both give the same answer" is just not true though
[22:45:12] <TsundereNoises> that's what I'm getting at
[22:45:19] <MootPoot> you guys still going on about that?
[22:45:19] <TsundereNoises> even though you CAN do multiplication and division in any order
[22:45:23] <emmeka> well it does, if you wrote it and solved it properly
[22:45:27] <TsundereNoises> you're pulling out the bottom number and putting it up top
[22:45:33] <TsundereNoises> those aren't equivalent 
[22:46:08] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I don't actually think my x and y example was ambiguous, I'm trying to figure out if it was in a way I couldn't see, or if you are making a mistake because you're just glazing over the difference
[22:46:28] <TsundereNoises> but I hope the x = 2, y = 4 example is unambiguous
[22:46:47] <TsundereNoises> and yeah, it's different, because of whether people are reading the y as on the bottom or top of the fraction
[22:47:14] <MootPoot> ????
[22:47:22] <MootPoot> my macbook wont start
[22:47:25] <TsundereNoises> my point is that, intuitively "2y" should be read as one unit on the bottom
[22:47:31] <MootPoot> then it decided to turn on and restart itself
[22:47:34] <emmeka> wait, no, you're right. y has been moved from the divisor like that.

[23:05:50] <TsundereNoises> Satin: so it'd be helpful if there was some way to prioritize or sort a "to read" list
[23:06:09] <Satin> some kind of value slider
[23:06:21] <TsundereNoises> yeah I'm not sure
[23:06:43] <TsundereNoises> but like when I'm wanting a new book (when I am not in the mood for anything I'm currently reading) I often waste a lot of time debating what to read
[23:06:55] <TsundereNoises> and a lot of that is looking at shelves and remembering what all the shit I want to read even is
