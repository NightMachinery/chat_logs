[09:34:05] <mattf> Hi, i am using coc for other langs and you know this pum menu thing of the auto completion? 
[09:35:07] <mattf> idk what is called, i have buffer auto completion (C-x C-p) all together with lsp and snippets but dictionary is missing there. so i have added a dictionary for cobol like this:  
[09:35:11] <mattf> autocmd FileType cobol set dictionary+=~/.config/nvim/cobol.dict
[09:35:25] <mattf> dictionary auto completion comes with C-x C-k
[09:35:53] <mattf> Is there a way to put this dictionary auto completion with the Coc pumenu autocompletion thing? or is there another way to achieve this
[09:36:58] <mjlbach[m]> have you looked at coc-spell?
[09:37:28] <mattf> no

[12:30:50] <mjlbach[m]> you can override the root_dir trivially in your config to test
[12:32:08] <numToStr[m]> Yes, I am planning to do that. Now I can finally say goodbye to CoC.
[12:32:37] <mjlbach[m]> The patterns in lspconfig try to be robust but occasionally there are edge cases, esp with javascript
[12:33:10] <mjlbach[m]> it's very difficult to predict in a universal way the correct root, I'll add project local configuration in the next few months that will let you just harcode things
[12:34:26] <numToStr[m]> No worries. Everyone loves to hate javascript. You all doing a fantastic job. I'll always be thankful :)
[12:35:26] <mjlbach[m]> :)

[16:15:32] *** X-Scale` is now known as X-Scale

[16:16:28] <clason[m]> (I'd recommend looking at TJ's other VODs; he's built a few plugins using tree-sitter on stream, so that might be helpful)
[16:17:07] <smolck> as ii14 mentioned, you get access to the AST of any file with a tree-sitter parser, essentially; what you need an AST for or what an AST would make easier (highlighting being the best example), tree-sitter will be great for

[18:59:04] <mjlbach[m]> the only point of intersection is arguably semantic tokens

[19:03:39] <anihm136[m]> For me the debate is often choosing between them for a specific task, rather than their capabilities themselves.

[19:21:37] <saltrocklamp[m]> imo i think lsp should probably take precedence over tree sitter when both are present, because the lsp is more likely to be correct, whereas the tree sitter one could be an approximation
[19:22:17] <saltrocklamp[m]> the precedence ideally would be something like: purpose-built plugin (e.g. semshi) > lsp > tree sitter > targets.vim > builtin text objects
[19:22:30] <mjlbach[m]> idk semshi is kinda slow
[19:22:39] <mjlbach[m]> it could be rebuilt on top of semantic tokens + treesitter
[19:22:42] <ii14[m]> you can query the AST with clangd, but that's non standard
[19:22:42] <saltrocklamp[m]> caveat: i haven't actually used semshi :)

[19:26:02] <ii14[m]> if it's just starting clangd
[19:26:14] <saltrocklamp[m]> but for example idris 2 has its own "ide mode" daemon that you could easily write a lua client for. the idris 2 lsp server wraps this in the lsp protocol, but you might also want to support other features that would otherwise require nonstandard lsp extensions, or you might just find it easier / have more control. so you might find it desirable to have clangd.nvim that doesn't use lsp but interacts directly w/ a clangd process
[19:26:24] <mjlbach[m]> so people can start implementing handlers for off-spec requests

[19:38:21] <ii14[m]> p00f: my idea was to do something like `:Lsp info`, `:Lsp start clangd`, `:Lsp definition` etc, with autocompletion and all
[19:38:29] <ii14[m]> mjlbach wasn't a fan of it :)
[19:38:32] <p00f> oo
[19:38:32] <mjlbach[m]> Eventually I will unify the lspinfo interface to work with all plugins
[19:38:45] <ii14[m]> but you could abbreviate it from `:lsp` to `:Lsp`

[19:42:11] <mjlbach[m]> (genuine question)

[19:42:25] <mjlbach[m]> if people strongly prefer it then its fine
[19:42:29] <ii14[m]> you can `<C-W>` it etc
[19:42:35] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah but LspInfo tab completes directly no?
[19:42:39] <p00f> mjlbach[m]: so that tab completion stops at lsp and then you can type in the next

[19:52:49] <bfredl> did you include both the `regexp_df.h.generated.h` and the `regexp_df.c.generated.h` in the respective places?
[19:53:08] <mjlbach[m]> <p00f> "so that tab completion stops..." <- wait how is this different than it stopping where it does currently

[19:55:40] <mjlbach[m]> right now :L <tab><tab> gets me to LspInfo
[19:55:53] <mjlbach[m]> :Ls<tab> gets me to LspInfo
[19:55:56] <gpanders> I think it does end up being more tabs/characters, but I think it also makes it more extensible, you can add as many subcommands to `:Lsp` as you want without polluting the global namespace
[19:55:58] <bfredl> it's a difference between vim (which magically includes all prototypes) and neovim (where we make this explicit)
[19:56:15] <mjlbach[m]> gpanders: how many do we anticipate having though?
[19:56:29] <kylo252[m]> bfredl: but the original function didn't exist in a header, so I moved it from from `regexp.c` -> `regexp_bt.c` and that `.pro` file is basically a header

[19:57:11] <JulianJulianBerm> (But I too prefer `:LspInfo`)
[19:57:37] <gpanders> I don't feel that strongly about it actually. I don't use the `:Lsp` commands very often as it is anyway
[19:57:37] <bfredl> kylo252[m]: what does that has do to with I said?  There must be a corresponding header file to each c source file.
[19:57:53] <mjlbach[m]> gpanders: yeah, I use LspInfo rarely haha (ironically)

[21:48:20] <mva> is it possible to somehow neovim to use... eeerm... something like "server" which other instances (each with windows/buffers/tabs list separate from others) will "connect" to and use it through API? (nvr doesn't look like that thing).
[21:48:22] <mva> Actually, real problem is that I don't like that each nvim instance I start runs tons of subprocesses: python with 4 forks + 4 threads (deoplete), lsp-servers (If I edit same kind of files in defferent sessions that leads to multiple copies of langservers) and so on...

[21:56:52] <bfredl> it's too late to change more defaults for 0.6 anyway, the remaining items should be considered for 0.7
[21:57:30] <mjlbach[m]> Oh I know
[21:57:34] <clason[m]> Only three remaining, and one is arguably a new feature, not a default.
[21:57:34] <mjlbach[m]> I was just curious

[22:15:16] <clason[m]> 2. forget about `display=truncate`, I don't see why that's better than the current default, `lastline`? 
[22:15:16] <clason[m]> 3. punt the `pumblend` to the colorscheme discussion (since that proposes a separate "truecolor" default scheme, which arguably can include "transparency")

[22:23:18] <clason[m]> yeah, I also don't feel strongly about these as defaults
[22:23:35] <bfredl> sunjonSenghanBri: depends how tricky it is to fix it.
[22:23:36] <clason[m]> (I do have strong feelings about what I want in my config, but that's different)
[22:24:06] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah there are some mjlbach defaults (mouse mode) that I know no one else would like haha
[22:24:17] <sunjonSenghanBri> I showed you some code for it. It was the extmark-over-unicode == randomness thing. (you commented 'interesting' at the time)
[22:24:42] <bfredl> but there is a deterministic repro now?
[22:24:50] <sunjonSenghanBri> it behaved differently on different invocations of nvim. either worked as intended, or everything on column 9
[22:25:26] <bfredl> or at least a simple, isolated repro
[22:25:38] <sunjonSenghanBri> yeah, I have a really simple way to reproduce it; you just have to run it a dozen times to see the problem
[22:25:46] <sunjonSenghanBri> I'll do it after I've eaten
[22:26:01] <bfredl> cool :)
[22:26:47] <sunjonSenghanBri> Shougo: I switched to DDC today. It's really nice. quite a bit of configuration, but feels like a spiritual successor of denite
[22:27:20] <sunjonSenghanBri> everything works really well. file and omni sources work better than they did for me in denite/completion.nvim

[22:30:50] <sunjonSenghanBri> my setup is a bit convoluted, as it's manual-trigger + delimitMate. I can try chop out that part and have it just a vanilla autocomplete setup (which more people would want perhaps)
