[20:01:44] <Inst> Lycurgus
[20:02:03] <Inst> Taoism has a philosophical and religious side
[20:02:12] <Inst> the religious side is only funny because they recently decided that Mao Zedong was a God
[20:02:19] <Inst> they tried to make Confucius into a God as well
[20:02:34] <Inst> so you have Taoist shrines to Mao Zedong and the Communist authorities are confused
[20:03:12] <Inst> Confucianism was originally secular and in its later stages, anti-religious, albeit traditional, so they tried to fork the philosophical side off Taoism
[20:04:07] <[exa]> x6C697370: in particular (following a the wiki definition) it's pretty hard to find any `x` to satisfy `a (+) x=b` if you're given a=NaN b=0
[20:04:29] <x6C697370> [xea]: right, computer floats (specifically, IEE-754). I suppose I was just wondering, if one was to think of them as an algebreic structure, what structure would one choose.
[20:04:51] <[exa]> without NaNs, you can go roughly like a=1e30, b=1e-30 (I expect the difference is inexact)

[20:05:39] <[exa]> hm well, something without much assurance on invertible operations :D
[20:05:57] <Lycurgus> Inst, in my world ( eg.meansofproduction.biz/eg/index.php/Antireligion ) taoism is all religion 
[20:06:13] <Inst> Read the Zhuangzi
[20:06:39] <Lycurgus> most things called chinese religions besides the folk stuff gave up on gods in the classical period
[20:06:43] <[exa]> x6C697370: honestly I don't think the computer-ish problems can be reasoned about so easily, you basically have a small program run in each operation with many ifs
[20:07:06] <Lycurgus> but a system of irreason doesn't need spooks to be a religion
[20:07:30] <monochrom> Socialism and communism are religions too. There.
[20:07:32] <[exa]> (computer-ish float problems)
[20:07:42] <Inst> correct, there are irrational aspects in Chinese philosophies, but rather, I'd argue that all philosophies have irrational aspects
[20:07:45] <Inst> axioms are not logical
[20:07:51] <Lycurgus> monochrom, as commonly promolgated, yes I agree
[20:07:52] <Inst> they're the basis of a logical system, but they're not proved
[20:08:00] <Inst> except in terms of each other
[20:08:05] <x6C697370> [xea]: Yeah, there's really not much one can say about floats... when reading, I learned that a+0.0=a is not always true for floats. There's a lot of weird behavior going on there.
[20:08:09] <Lycurgus> they were in the late 19th and early 20th century but they are by now
[20:08:18] <Lycurgus> *they weren't
[20:08:36] <x6C697370> *exa, not xea, sorry
[20:08:43] <Inst> I actually argue that Chinese Marxism is stronger because from Confucianism it incorporates "spiritual" aspects
[20:09:13] <Lycurgus> i would say that makes it weaker
[20:09:38] <Inst> spiritual, in the sense of how one should conduct oneself and what one's virtues should be
[20:09:40] <[exa]> x6C697370: anyway good question, I really don't have anything better at hand than resorting to turing-style tricks
[20:09:44] <ongy[m]> x6C697370: don't try to make sense of iee754 implementations

[20:09:49] <Lycurgus> also I don't see confucian principles as "spiritual"
[20:09:52] <Inst> for a Western equivalent, imagine if Marxism decided to package Stoicism within itself
[20:10:17] <Inst> that's what I mean by "spiritual", i.e, ethics that can deny reality as well as drive labor discipline etc
[20:10:29] <Lycurgus> outside of mathematics people can call stuff whatever they want
[20:10:42] <[exa]> Lycurgus: outside?!
[20:10:45] <[exa]> wait
[20:11:09] <Inst> June Chang's complaint that her cadre father made her walk while he rode in the official car because it'd be nepotism otherwise is what I mean by "spiritual" aspects of Confucianism
[20:11:34] <Lycurgus> ah ok yeah my point about rectification of names
[20:12:01] <Lycurgus> i hall that humor or whatever
[20:12:04] <Lycurgus> *call
[20:12:08] <Inst> there's a double impulse
[20:12:34] <Inst> on one hand, having the correct names for things keeps things clean and understandable, i.e, lobbying is just corruption and the euphemism disguises it
[20:12:38] <Lycurgus> anybody else using copilot with hs
[20:12:52] <Inst> cya, i have to get back to trying to develop a haskell course while not properly knowing haskell
[20:12:58] <Inst> and keeping my friend from running away to python
[20:13:15] <Lycurgus> i think most people would agree lobbying is a kind of legal corruption
[20:13:25] <x6C697370> [exa], thanks for clarifying my weird float thoughts
[20:14:02] <Inst> on the other hand, I'm with Zhuangzi:
[20:14:12] <Inst> "words are like nets, things are like fish"
[20:14:16] <Inst> which is sort of Kantian
[20:14:32] <[exa]> x6C697370: stay safe with integers. :]
[20:15:02] <[exa]> Inst: linguistic&etymology community disagrees
[20:18:35] <Inst> exa: in modern language, words are symbols, things are referents
[20:18:44] <Inst> i'm trying to find the passage
[20:19:46] <[exa]> not sure if that applies even to chinese
[20:20:26] <Inst> but that's probably a partial mapping, tbh
[20:21:41] <[exa]> like, my original point was that the languages develop precisely the other way
[20:21:55] <Inst> https://ctext.org/zhuangzi/what-comes-from-without?searchu=fishing%20stakes&searchmode=showall#n2956
[20:22:43] <Inst> meaning, not things
[20:24:13] <Inst> so it's more oriented toward mentalese or platonic objects
[20:24:35] <Inst> what does it matter if words and phrases are no longer correct as long as the referent / idea is communicated?
[20:24:59] <Lycurgus> based on prior convo
[20:25:26] <Lycurgus> i think you know what comes after "if words and phrases are no longer correct"
[20:26:10] <Lycurgus> shaka, when the walls fell

[20:26:46] <Inst> it's just more interesting, creative, etc from an artistic and cultural point of view when everything is hidden in metaphor
[20:27:02] <Inst> and arguably it creates more interesting social analysis as the etymology becomes shown
[20:27:13] <Inst> to have a word that is no longer correct, etc, means that the word now has a denser meaning
[20:27:18] <Inst> greater information density is now possible
[20:27:32] <Inst> on the other hand, "rectification of names", this is socially deleterious
[20:27:44] <Lycurgus> to some extent this line is true
[20:27:50] <Inst> you have two contradictory principles
[20:28:00] <Lycurgus> wetware and do messy stuff like that but bits can't
[20:28:03] <Inst> as with always, wisdom and virtue are somewhere between the extremes
[20:28:27] *** Joins: merijn (~merijn@83-160-49-249.ip.xs4all.nl)
[20:28:40] <Lycurgus> so a knowledge based system makes hard sense out messy apparently contradictory stuff
[20:28:52] <Lycurgus> a digital one that is
[20:29:08] <Lycurgus> *out of messy
[20:29:24] <Lycurgus> *wetware can
[20:29:45] <Inst> I also mean that as a defense of philosophical daoism
[20:29:50] <Inst> you learn how to think in terms of contradictions
[20:29:52] <monochrom> I know that programmers come up with incorrect names all the time.  My favourite examples are "RAII" and "test pollution".
[20:30:33] <monochrom> The correct name for "RAII" would be resource release upon exit.
[20:30:44] <Inst> there is no "right way", the correct way to do things is a function of context and circumstance, and that's also a function of values
[20:30:48] *** Joins: fendor (~fendor@178.165.196.101.wireless.dyn.drei.com)
[20:30:54] <monochrom> The correct name for "test polluition" is test interdependency.
[20:30:55] <Lycurgus> i will grant that philosophical taoism, manichism and the like could be just dump philosophies rather than religions
[20:30:56] <Inst> which is the ponit of ZhuangZi, tbh, he gets people to try to challenge their own values
[20:31:16] <Inst> or to at least become more aware of them
[20:31:26] <Inst> that they have axioms / postulates that are unstated
[20:31:27] <Lycurgus> *Manichaeism
[20:31:28] <monochrom> Oh and the correct name for "security vulnerability" is bugs.
[20:31:36] <Inst> like how theists have a hidden postulate of "God exists"
[20:32:05] <Inst> and then all the arguments flare up because they try to insist that "God exists" can be proven in terms of all other known phenomenon (postulates)
[20:32:32] <Inst> monochrom: security vulnerability is good enough, tbh
[20:32:38] <Lycurgus> *dumb
[20:32:44] <Inst> or rather, "bug that creates vulnerabilities"
[20:33:28] <monochrom> bug exploitation >:)
[20:34:10] <Inst> Lycurgus: the reason the Taoists are good, though, tbh
[20:34:20] <Inst> "The Tao that can be followed is not the eternal Tao"
[20:34:30] <monochrom> Actually even "bug" is an incorrect name, people avoiding to confess to human errors.
[20:34:52] <Inst> "The Name that can be Named is not the Eternal Name"
[20:34:56] <Lycurgus> yeah that's the primary statement of its obscurantism
[20:34:59] <Inst> ????
[20:35:09] <Inst> Tao maps to "absolute"
[20:35:11] *** Quits: merijn (~merijn@83-160-49-249.ip.xs4all.nl) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[20:35:13] <Lycurgus> sayin' "i am a mysticism"
[20:35:29] <Inst> put another way, there's a finite data capacity of the human brain
[20:35:40] <Inst> can the universe fit within the finite data capacity of the human brain?
[20:35:54] <Inst> or, alternately, there is an optimal course of action
[20:36:05] <Inst> can the finite human brain calculate and execute this optimal course of action?
[20:36:08] * Lycurgus doesn believe in concrete infinities
[20:36:14] <Lycurgus> either
[20:36:35] <Inst> hence we can refer to the Tao or all these infinities as concepts, but not "fully" understand them
[20:36:46] <Lycurgus> except for space and time 
[20:37:01] <Inst> only if we can prove that for each discrete unit all physical laws continue to apply
[20:37:23] <Inst> that's the non-mystic explanation of daokedao, feichangdao, mingkeming, feichangming
[20:37:35] <Inst> "the dao that can be daoed is not the eternal dao, the name that can be named is not the eternal name"
[20:37:48] <Inst> "ultimates exist, but you can't grasp them"
[20:38:09] <monochrom> The modern wording is "those are social constructs" and suddenly it is not mysticism.
[20:38:10] <Inst> see Feng Youlan's "A Short History of Chinese Philosophy"
[20:38:30] <Inst> hence philosophical taoism vs religious taoism
[20:38:50] <Inst> and within philosophical taoism you can strain out more mystical interpretations vs more concrcete interpretations
[20:39:16] <Inst> Taoism is attributed to court historians, who looked through the patterns of history and tried to see the ultimate pattern
[20:39:26] <Inst> their conclusion: "there probably is an ultimate pattern, but we can't comprehend it"
[20:40:31] <Inst> also, it's great for interpreting the Tao Te Ching, tbh
[20:44:36] <Inst> nah, it's passage 56
[20:44:47] <Inst> i thought it was bookended with "those who know, do not say, those who say, do not know"
[20:45:01] <Inst> which, implies, consequently, the author of the Dao De Jing doesn't actually know of it
[20:45:38] <Inst> the opening says: "You can't do the Dao, you can't name the name"
[20:46:28] <Inst> would have been great if it ended with "if we actually knew anything, we wouldn't have said it, since we said it, we don't actually know anything"
[20:51:11] <Lycurgus> hmm, google attributes that quote (in main channel) to Emerson but I always heard it was Gladstone
[20:56:12] <Inst> https://terebess.hu/english/tao/lau.html#Kap56
[20:57:15] <Inst> the actual thesis of the Dao De Jing to me seems to be more an awareness of the limits of knowledge and the limits of action
[20:57:54] <Inst> it gives you all these sorts of contradictions to open your mind to the idea that "hey, maybe the way we've done it or thought it the entire time was wrong and we should reevaluate and try again with a new paradigm"
