[00:35:20] <bakerst> mind that curl -F has special syntax so it'll break (potentially in unsafe ways) if you ever run it on filenames that contain special characters such as semicolon, quotes or such
[00:37:37] <emanuele6> if you can use -F'file=@-' and make curl read the file from stdin with a redirection to prevent this
[00:39:07] <emanuele6> but you may need to provide a dummy filename to make it work, e.g. ".txt": '-F'file=@-;filename=.txt'

[06:23:15] <honkydonkydong> emanuele6: I am on an userland (android) virtual system with arch installed now and I have put your script here on this system. when i run it, bash tells me that it cant find /dev/stdin and true when i ls into "most"(a pager) I can't find it :( But on the status bar in most it stands: *stdin* so it must be somewhare.. ok now the question.. how can i find out the location of the folder stdin on this

[06:24:03] <emanuele6> is that really bash?
[06:24:11] <honkydonkydong> bash must know it
[06:24:21] <honkydonkydong> yeah
[06:24:42] <emanuele6> because bash will emulate /dev/stdin if the os doesn't support it
[06:24:48] <neshpion> arch, like everything else that i know of, puts stdin at /dev/stdin
[06:24:48] <honkydonkydong> it is a full 32bit arch system
[06:24:52] <emanuele6> do you know what version?
[06:25:07] <e36freak> arch doesn't have a version, but there is no official 32 bit arch anymore
[06:25:16] <emanuele6> i meant version of bash

[06:25:23] <e36freak> ah
[06:25:28] <e36freak> echo $BASH_VERSION

[06:26:00] <e36freak> that OS should support it as well
[06:26:03] <e36freak> something's not right
[06:26:06] <a1> dumb question, but if you're catting /dev/stdin, it should repeat everything you type after that, correct?
[06:26:14] <e36freak> try it and see
[06:26:26] <e36freak> should be identical to cat with no arguments though
[06:26:27] <a1> it does.. my next question was why does /dev/stderr do the same thing
[06:26:55] <honkydonkydong> GNU bash, version 5.1.8(1)-release (armv7l-unknown-linux-gnueabihf)
[06:27:18] <a1> don't think that i've actually ever used cat without args

[06:29:03] <a1> oh
[06:29:03] <a1> lol
[06:29:17] <e36freak> as for your question, not sure, but stdout/stderr shouldn't generally be used for or supported for input redirection

[13:15:51] <Soliton> that doesn't look like a bash error.

[13:16:27] <Soliton> are the semicolons literal arguments for a command or shell code?

[13:17:28] <Fernando-Basso> They should separate multiple kitty invocations. Therefore, shell code.
[13:18:07] <Soliton> don't put them in an array then. you could put them in a function and put the function in the array.

[13:26:24] <chiselfuse> I need to grep for ranges of IP addresses of countries, I came up with    `grep -E '1\.2\.[3-6]\.[0-255]|4\.3\.[2-4]\.[0-255]'`   to get the two ranges of   1.2.3.0 -- 1.2.6.255  and  4.3.2.0 -- 4.3.4.255   Now I would like to populate this regex with a list of ranges of a specific country. But writing it out is very tedious and writing a `curl | sed` command to get a page and organize the list into the
[13:26:31] <chiselfuse> regex seems like waste of time and effort too. Does anyone know a good source of a readily available regex, or does anyone know of a reputable site that provides country/region specific lists to which writing such a `curl | sed` script would be worthwhile?

[19:07:00] <chiselfuse> I want to test a Bash script that takes the paths of two files as arguments (ie ./script path/file1 path/file2). But I want to play with the contents of the test files on the command-line. I'm trying to do something like:   echo "foo">3; echo "bar">4; ./script /dev/fd/3 /dev/fd/4   But it's obviously wrong and I'm confused how to do it.

Utilities such as sed, grep and cut are not suitable for parsing it. Instead, use csvline (from http://to.lhunath.com/bashlib), csvtool, csvkit, csv (Python), Text::CSV (Perl) etc.
