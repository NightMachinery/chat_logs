[00:10:18] <CalimeroTeknik> "unsettling yet entirely plausible"
[00:10:57] <CalimeroTeknik> "the truth is too obvious to ignore now"
[00:11:04] <CalimeroTeknik> speaking about feelings of FUD
[00:11:44] <CalimeroTeknik> "I just want the truth"
[00:11:59] <CalimeroTeknik> so much bs in my face right at the start, all red flags are up
[00:13:46] <CalimeroTeknik> all of that to say that there are tons of sites that are generated by not even legit machine learning stuff‚Ä¶
[00:16:03] <CalimeroTeknik> overall rating: 2/10, focusing on feelings after bringing up a valid point, stopped watching at 3 minutes
[00:17:25] <CalimeroTeknik> stop judging with your gut, it can at best hint you where to look, but if you find no proof, move on
[00:24:40] <CalimeroTeknik> jan6, unless there's more in the video, I call it overblown emotional content over stuff that's what it is
[00:24:51] <jan6> lol

[00:25:48] <CalimeroTeknik> still image, not 29 damn minutes, quick at conveying the point
[00:26:58] <jan6> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FtPvDGrpkA has slightly more facts, in the form of doing an experiment with google search, and "oh hey, on 34th page you have a billion results, on 35th you have a few hundred" and "enabling all the "similar" results is still only a few hundred results total, and almost nothing before 2016, other than by a few academical and governmental sources"

[00:27:42] <jan6> lol nice image though
[00:29:59] <CalimeroTeknik> I noticed how google displayed overblown estimates of number of search results
[00:30:38] <CalimeroTeknik> and if you really demand to instantiate the results themselves, oh wait just 14 results actually
[00:31:57] <CalimeroTeknik> okay and what's the point behind it?
[00:32:43] <CalimeroTeknik> this should have a tl;dr in text form, I'm not watching any more of these videos that start with one minute of "it will feel flabbergasting (btw pls soobscribe & bell eye con)"
