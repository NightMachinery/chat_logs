[04:07:05] <ayecee> Gaboradon: okay but you know you can launch a process with strace, yes?
[04:07:10] <Bashstreet> It is not trolling to disagree with you.
[04:07:13] <Gaboradon> ayecee: strace won't run without a pid, didn't you just said "I didn't manage to make it to monitor all"
[04:07:14] <gry> Bashstreet: i agree with you that it does. why do you say that though? are you willing to volunteer?
[04:07:17] <ayecee> so that it is traced from the moment it starts
[04:07:42] <ayecee> Gaboradon: i don't know how you jumped from that to "won't run without a pid"
[04:08:03] <Gaboradon> ayecee: Why are you telling it to me as if I could have possibly known that, I never heard of this program before a minute ago.
[04:08:34] <ayecee> Gaboradon: i dunno, i thought you would read the manpage for a program you had never heard of before to see what it does and how to use it

[04:09:34] <ayecee> Gaboradon: do you know what the word or means?
[04:09:42] <Bashstreet> There are just no drive in linux community to create userfriendly distro's . The Distro's that are more average user oriented are broken junk. I rather just use command line.

[04:12:24] <ayecee> Gaboradon: you have the option to either give it the program to run and its arguments, or to give it a pid to trace. the word or, there, means you can do either one of those things.
[04:13:05] <Bashstreet> Linux has tiny userbase compared to other operating systems. And for one reason . It is not user friendly for average user

[10:42:23] <jim> when I watched an early upgrade of debian in-place, it went to elf executables and from libc4 to libc5 in the same upgrade
[10:42:28] <CuriosTiger> The last big problem I had was, incidentally, with Debian
[10:42:38] <CuriosTiger> and that was an upgrade from potato to woody that went awry.
[10:43:10] <CuriosTiger> I must've typoed apt-get dist-upgrade to apt-get destroy-upgrade

[13:28:40] <Gaboradon> Hi, I'm wondering ... looking at the distro docs, there's a number of wayland compositors or what that there is to choose from, are they actually mandatory to pick one of them and configure to get "the wayland" working?

[13:31:02] <Namarrgon> sdl has a wayland backend but it should work without it using xwayland just fine, too
[13:31:53] <jim> you can probably mount /var before you start typical services, you may also need to copy the existing /var (as stored on the / partition) to the device to be mounted as /var

[13:33:34] <Gaboradon> Well I want to run a 3d development program, a GUI window, in a minimal non-DE distro, setting things up manually as I go, but it never makes it obvious or the programs request any additional configuraton
[13:34:35] <Gaboradon> I've set up the XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=wayland as the docs say, that's pretty much I done, I only installed "wayfire" yesterday but it didn't work either
[13:34:54] <Namarrgon> "XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=wayland" is just wrong

[14:14:35] <Namarrgon> Gaboradon: imho, in your case it would be better to start top-down and remove components until it breaks again, so you know which parts you need.

[14:54:27] <hexnewbie> Using Motif software like xpdf is the strangest thing. Open dialog supports UTF-8 filenames in the directory and file lists, but the input boxes are mojibake, the KWin title bar is correctly displaying the unicode filename, but the Plasma launcher button is also mojibake. OK, I blame Motif for using the font's encoding, and xpdf for ignoring the font for its text boxes...

I'd bootstrap the installation myself, set the serial console in the manually debootstrapped installation, and then use one. But that's effectively a manual installation, not running the installer

[15:40:09] <hexnewbie> jason1234: I think running the installer over SPICE or VNC, then adjusting it to work with a serial console, or the curses text mode, or SSH, that's the simplest way to do it if the installer breaks in the curses text mode

[16:57:55] <gtlsgamr> preferably free
[16:58:16] <hexnewbie> jason1234: In descending order in degree of difficulty: 1. Use remote virt-manager with libvirt to configure the VM, and see the graphical screen over SSH. 2. Create a SPICE or VNC graphical and share it over IP, and install from there. 3. Install debian by hand without the installer. 4. Edit the ISO to inject parameters for serial console, serial console needs serial console **NOT** -curses
[16:58:22] <hexnewbie> jason1234: 5. Whatever on Earth you're doing

[19:04:58] <tirnanog> Shariff: it's also interesting that the sticky bit is set. that does indicate that it cares about the 4th digit (or absence thereof).
[19:05:00] <Shariff> ayecee: it seems it was only the directory in /mnt .. everything else had the normal (rwxrwxr-x) pattern
[19:05:06] <mike18> thanks

[19:06:06] <Shariff> Well it seems to work now.. so.. if it ain't broke, etc :)
[19:06:14] <Shariff> I really appreciate your help and patience with me :)
[19:06:17] <tirnanog> you should check the actual mode of the mountpoint.
[19:06:23] <tirnanog> because leaving it that way wouldn't be good.

[21:05:34] <gnawa> hexnewbie: there is a specific application tht uses the second display as framebuffer (nanodlp)
[21:06:28] <batmank3389> hello. i have a weird problem. i am running oracle linux 7 and seeing a problem when i do yum update. the error is "[Errno 14] curl#35 - "Peer reports incompatible or unsupported protocol version.""
[21:06:52] <tirnanog> kuhilas: correct.
[21:06:53] <hexnewbie> https://www.nanodlp.com/2021/01/24/nanodlp-display-engine/ seems to disagree
[21:06:59] <batmank3389> i have found that the solution is to update curl, which is via yum update curl. which is funny
[21:07:16] <clarity> akk: Yes but limiting lines doesn't help if you get a lot of input with no line breaks
[21:07:24] <kuhilas> tirnanog; ok thanks

[21:08:04] <akk> clarity: Since it's just text, though, to be a RAM problem on modern systems I would think it would have to be a fairly huge number of lines.
[21:08:33] <akk> well, I guess if you had lines that were millions of characters long, but I'm not sure you can even do that in xterm
