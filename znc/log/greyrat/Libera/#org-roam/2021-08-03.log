[00:49:31] <z3t0> hi all, I have been working to get my notes migrated to v2, and I think I have org-roam v2 setup and notes migrated but am trying to setup a replacement for org-roam-server. I setup org-roam-ui and can run its code, but when I activate org-roam-ui and it opens the URL in the browser I get a 404
[00:49:47] <z3t0> I'm not familiar enough with lisp or org-roam-ui to figure out how I can debug this, any advice?
[01:07:39] <z3t0> Okay I think I figured out the issue, the http server is expecting the frontend files to be at elpa, but its actually at quelpa. I'm using use-package and quelpa-use-package instead of straight.el

[01:42:02] <narwic> z3t0: so org-roam-ui's .el file isn't coming in?
[01:42:20] <narwic> if that's the case I think use-package has a source directive you can add to point directly to it.
[01:49:25] <narwic> I just set it up without any issues - make sure you're including the statement for the websocket package.
[01:49:53] <narwic> after you've installed, run <M-x> org-roam-ui-mode to actually start the server.

[05:27:55] <narwic> anybody know of a way to merge org-capture and org-roam-capture together - sorta makes me nutty trying to remember which one has the capture template I'm looking for

[06:37:16] <sm2n> So, with org-roam v2 the org-roam buffer is now a normal buffer, is there any way I can replicate the old behaviour? I want the backlink window to stay fixed, and clicking links in it to not open in the same window
[06:37:38] <sm2n> it's really annoying to browse through all the backlinks on a single node the way it's set up
[06:40:05] <narwic> sm2n: you can tell it to be a side window
[06:40:19] <narwic> I fixed up the description for that in the docs actually
[06:40:28] <narwic> there's an example
[06:42:17] <sm2n> this? https://www.orgroam.com/manual.html#Configuring-the-Org_002droam-buffer-display
[06:42:56] <sm2n> oh, I didn't realize C-u RET used the other window
[06:43:05] <sm2n> hmmm, now I'm undecided
[06:43:29] <narwic> I've never been able to get that to work, but I've also rebound C-u so I can use it like vim
[06:43:59] <narwic> but yeah, that example for display-buffer-in-side-window should keep the backlinks buffer on its own
[06:45:59] <sm2n> I think the behaviour I want is the default but reversed
[06:46:05] <sm2n> maybe I will learn how to use el-patch
[06:46:33] <sm2n> non-side window seems more flexible with different window layouts
[06:47:01] <sm2n> I think I had an issue before with running org-roam on a vertical (portrait) monitor with the side window
[07:09:26] <sm2n> I managed to get something satisfactory
[07:09:33] <sm2n> (advice-add 'org-roam-preview-visit :filter-args
[07:09:33] <sm2n> 	      #'(lambda (args)
[07:09:33] <sm2n> 		  (list (cl-first args) (cl-second args) (not (cl-third args)))))
[07:12:32] <sm2n> doesn't work with the node titles though, would have to advise org-roam-node-visit, which I don't want to do because that is used for other things
[07:19:44] <z3t0> Hi narwic, sorry I was out all day and just saw your messages. Thanks for helping out!
[07:20:02] <z3t0> For the dependencies I just used use-package to manually install them in the lines before in my config file
[07:20:48] <z3t0> Here's how I am trying to set it up, https://pastebin.com/rQfvuKSK
[07:23:34] <sm2n> z3t0, does that include the "out/" directory?
[07:23:55] <sm2n> I'm not sure how quelpa works but it's worth checking
[07:24:23] <sm2n> personally I couldn't get org-roam-ui working either, but rather than a 404 the frontend would immediately crash
[07:34:53] <z3t0> So in my root .emacs.d I have the elpa directory and the quelpa directory, the quelpa has the source (git clone) as well as the out directory. The elpa just has the .el files.
[07:35:19] <z3t0> My guess is that the package manager clones into quelpa, builds only the lisp and then copies only that over into the elpa. But this is just a guess
[07:35:32] <z3t0> I'm going to try using straight.el and see how that goes
[07:42:06] <sm2n> you need the out directory with the files that are actually used, since that's where the webapp stuff is
[07:42:30] <sm2n> note that the out directory has to be manually specified in the straight recipe too
[07:42:57] <sm2n> out of curiosity, is there any reason you use quelpa? I've never met anyone who used it

[17:19:28] <Enfors> Sometimes when I org-roam-node-insert or org-roam-node-find and enter the EXACT name of an existing node (no extra spaces at the end), it gives me a new empty node instead of the pre-existing one with the same name. Any ideas why?
[17:19:56] <Enfors> I get the feeling a cache or something is corrupt.
[17:22:59] <Enfors> Now when I look, I seem to have duplicate files (same node name, but different numbers preceeding them), like "12345-python.org" and "54321-python.org".
[17:44:56] <Enfors> Now something's seriously messed up. I can load existing nodes with org-roam-node-find (they don't come up as a new capture buffer) - but when they're loaded, they're still empty. I have no idea what's going on.

[19:28:32] <Enfors> I started a new Zettelkasten in a new empty directory now to experiment. I may have been able to isolate the problem: It seems org-roam-node-find gives me a NEW empty node even if one with that name already exists, IF the name starts with for example "foo" and I ALSO have OTHER nodes with names starting with "foo".
[19:29:59] <Enfors> So if what I type as argument for org-roam-node-find before pressint REG only matches that one node, then it works. If there are multiple nodes that start with that same string (what I typed), then I erraneously get a new empty node.
[19:30:45] <Enfors> I guess I should start by updating to the latest Emacs (running 26.3 now) and see if that changes anything...

[23:37:53] <z3t0> sm2n, I was just using use-package and had heard of quelpa so tried that. But now I switched to straight.el
[23:38:10] <z3t0> narwic what was the error you were getting? 
[23:38:24] <z3t0> Using straight.el I am able to get the frontend to load but am getting a type error: Uncaught TypeError: Invalid attempt to spread non-iterable instance.
