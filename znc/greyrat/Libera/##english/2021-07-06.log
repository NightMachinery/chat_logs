[09:11:05] <Babar> Hey Voxel
[09:11:32] <Babar> *"is this correct?"
[09:11:35] <Babar> and no, it isn't
[09:11:38] <Voxel> s/ a//
[09:11:39] <tinsoldier> V​oxel meant: What do you think, is that correct? "I've been trying to find suitable drums for one track within two weeks, already..."
[09:12:00] <Babar> still not correct :D
[09:12:23] <Voxel> Babar, I see. Too close for "that" right? Like, not abstract enough?
[09:12:42] <Babar> too close for that, yes
[09:13:06] <Babar> perhaps you can rephrase it as "I've been trying to find suitable drums for one track for two weeks already", but saying for twice, while not grammatically incorrect, feels cumbersome
[09:13:32] <Voxel> within?
[09:13:59] <Babar> "I've spent two weeks trying to find suitable drums for one track" sounds better, but I don't know if it relays the same intent and information you want
[09:14:00] <Voxel> i.e. "within two weeks already"
[09:14:09] <Babar> no, not within
[09:14:23] <Voxel> Hm...
[09:14:38] <Babar> within doesn't work in this format
[09:14:43] <Voxel> The second variant doesn't highlight the fact that the process is still going
[09:15:01] <Voxel> Doesn't ot?
[09:15:02] <Voxel> it*
[09:15:07] <Babar> nope, within is wrong

[09:15:54] <Babar> within wouldn't work at all in either case :D
[09:16:14] <Voxel> I dropped the "within" as soon as you mentioned it.
[09:17:19] <Babar> "I've been looking for suitable drums for one track for two weeks now" is correct, as I said, it just sounds laborious

[09:24:08] <Babar> that also implies it is in the past, and not still ongoing

[11:17:28] <tinsoldier> Socialized medicine is a term used in the United States to describe and discuss systems of universal health care: medical and hospital care for all by means of government regulation of health care and subsidies derived from taxation.

[15:56:06] <kill-animals> "Editors have learned that formation into "gangs" is the most effective way of imposing their views on opposite-minded contributors. It makes a travesty of the revert-rule when one individual can simply send an e-mail alert to friends requesting a timely "revert favour" once they have reached the limit of their daily reverts. This may apply to deletion debates as well, where a group of editors may be organised so as to 
[15:56:06] <kill-animals> always vote en masse in favour of keeping an article written by one of the gang, or related to the gang's main field of interest; or to push through deletion if their interest is a deletionism. Gangs sometimes do serious damage to Wikipedia's policies and guidelines also; by ganging up they can be written to say almost anything."
[15:56:22] <dminuoso> That's quite a leap
[15:56:44] <dminuoso> This does not read "Wikipedia is trash for anything remotely political. Its run by cartels at this point"

You made a claim that wikipedia founders said as much that "its run by cartels at this point" and "Wikipedia is trash for anything remotely political.". Your quotation does not even remotely demonstrate these previous claims.
[16:01:40] <dminuoso> So get your facts straight, rather than meddling with wild conspiracy theories.
[16:01:47] <huf> and even then, citing wikipedia about it? :D
[16:01:53] <huf> we cant trust it, surely
[16:01:56] <dminuoso> huf: There's some irony in that, yes!

[16:02:47] <huf> :D
[16:02:47] <kill-animals> There you go. 
[16:02:53] <huf> daily mail
[16:02:58] <huf> now we're getting somewhere
[16:04:36] <huf> btw, predictably, that article is laughably false
[16:04:39] <kill-animals> ^ Demonstrative of what is wrong with wikipedia, given that they have a source bias that must only come from places like the ADL 
[16:04:42] <huf> but then it's quoting fox news, so of course it is
[16:05:08] <huf> because you see, the communism article does contain references to atrocities committed by communist governments
[16:05:14] <huf> while the capitalism article doesnt
[16:05:29] <kill-animals> huf: I can't tell if this is bait
[16:05:31] <huf> so if anything, the fucking opposite of what the daily mail and fox news and this fuck claim is true :)
[16:05:47] <kill-animals> woah language. Calm down huf
[16:05:47] <huf> kill-animals: this isnt bait, i actually checked wiki just now
[16:06:24] <huf> of course, the daily mail may be conflating neolibs with communists
[16:06:32] <huf> that's the sort of idiocy they like to do
[16:07:23] <kill-animals> calm down. I'm talking more about articles having to do with political assasinations like with seth rich, or with the fact that the election was stolen from Donald Trump. I have not checked the latter, but I can guarantee that there is no neutrality in those articles given that the consequences for those turning out to be true are existentially significant
[16:07:24] <dminuoso> kill-animals: You're still misrepresenting your text. First, it's only Sander and not Wales (which means it's only *one* of the two founders, not both). Secondly, his examples are both specific and non-specific, but I cant gather a complete mistrust in "anything remotely political" or that "its all run by cartels" from it.
[16:08:01] <huf> well yeah but apparently it's now a fact that the election was stolen from trump
[16:08:04] <huf> so you know
[16:08:09] <huf> I think we can end this here
[16:08:21] <kill-animals> > b b b but only one of the founders of wikipedia says its bad
[16:08:37] <kill-animals> yeah okay. 
[16:08:50] <dminuoso> huf: It took me a long while to realize that truth really is subjective, and there's more to "alternative facts" than some might believe.
[16:10:41] <dminuoso> But this is more philosophical or psychological.
[16:11:17] <kill-animals> huf: Yeah I would encourage you to re-evaluate your attitude as well. Just because something comes from fox news, does not mean its false. If anything, the falsity of a place like Fox News, is the fact that they don't talk about some things that are important. 
[16:12:48] <huf> kill-animals: yeah but I actually did look it up and it's absurdly false
[16:12:57] <huf> so what exactly do you want me to re-evaluate here?
[16:13:22] <kill-animals> What is "false" exactly?
[16:13:45] <huf> the part where it talks about articles about communism on wikipedia
[16:13:50] <kill-animals> I don't know what you "looked" up, and why that is epistemelogically relevant.
[16:13:56] <huf> you know, I just randomly checked just that one part
[16:14:05] <kill-animals> I never mentioned communism
[16:14:07] <kill-animals> you did
[16:14:13] <huf> you pasted that daily mail article
[16:14:21] <huf> as some kind of proof of this nonsense you're saying
[16:14:31] <kill-animals> It cited the co-founder.
[16:14:35] <kill-animals> Thats all I needed.
[16:14:47] <kill-animals> he called it a failure, and pointed out the cartel problem
[16:14:56] <kill-animals> Huge left wing bias
[16:15:36] <kill-animals> I've also experienced it. They really are quite brilliant in how they control certain articles. The left has got their shit together when it comes to things like this.
[16:16:18] <huf> yeah, but he pointed that out in an article that's full of lies
[16:16:22] <huf> by a rag that's always full of lies
[16:16:30] <huf> so excuse me when I dont trust a single thing in that
[16:16:57] <kill-animals> yeah moving the goalposts.
[16:17:07] <kill-animals> I post wikipedia criticizing itself and you reject it
[16:17:18] <huf> no, it just wasnt saying what you were saying
[16:17:31] <huf> because so far you've failed to support your original claim
[16:17:47] <kill-animals> Yeah it was. It mentioned cartels. And you were like, "but it doesnt say left wing cartels"
[16:17:57] <huf> no, I wasnt like that at all
[16:18:03] <huf> cite me
[16:18:28] <kill-animals> like you are intentionally being wishy washy. Its obvious that the left would form a cartel to control certain things. Companies do it too.
[16:18:43] <huf> no it isnt obvious
[16:18:58] <huf> so far I'm not even convinced you know what the left is
[16:19:08] <kill-animals> And then when I asked you, you refused to answer, because you knew if you did, it would just give me ammunition

[16:21:28] <huf> you're not doing well
[16:21:52] <twb> kill-animals: you made an extraordinary claim, then cited an opinion piece which did not substantiate your claim.  Rather than giving a better citation, you then asked a strawman question.
[16:21:52] <kill-animals> You are dumb if you believe it is irrelevant to ask teleological questions on the nature of wikipedia bias.
[16:22:49] <huf> sure
[16:22:53] <kill-animals> twb: wikipedia's founder. You just dont want to give credence because both of you are super left wing. Its smart that you don't. It works with most people.
[16:22:54] <huf> but that's not what we're discussing here
[16:23:14] <huf> kill-animals: even if we believe that he said this, it doesnt prove your point
[16:23:26] <huf> but he didnt actually say what you said
[16:23:38] <twb> kill-animals: where is your inadequate citation attributed to Wales?
[16:23:38] <huf> so you're at least two hops away from what you want
[16:23:39] <kill-animals> Yeah it does. Both of you act like wikipedia editors.
[16:23:58] <huf> repeating your baseless claims doesnt help
[16:24:04] <huf> go find better evidence
[16:24:10] <kill-animals> imagine I came to an article and cited dailymail. you'd both say, "Thats not huffington post or the ADL. So were rejecting your edit as biased."
[16:24:40] <twb> That would rather depend on the claim
[16:24:49] <kill-animals> hahah, yeah. 
[16:24:50] <twb> If your claim was "the daily mail said X", then citing the daily mail would be entirely appropriate.
[16:24:51] <huf> what does this have to do with the original claim, again?
[16:25:20] <twb> If your claim was "all donkeys are homophobic", then I would expect something like The Lancet
[16:25:22] <kill-animals> And again, both of you are super left wing. Why would either of you agree with me when I am attacking wikipedia for having a left wing bias?
[16:25:32] <kill-animals> Obviously you are going to defend wikipedia
[16:25:35] <kill-animals> Thats just smart
[16:25:40] <huf> but that wasnt your original claim
[16:25:45] <huf> are you abandoning that one then?
[16:25:50] <huf> are we to discuss this new one?
[16:26:09] <twb> kill-animals: did you claim Wikipedia has bias?  I think you claimed it was unreliable for political statements.
[16:26:13] <kill-animals> And now he's trying to move the goalposts again. He doesnt deny that he is super left wing
[16:26:33] <huf> kill-animals: oh is that what we're supposed to discuss now?
[16:26:38] <huf> whether I'm left wing or not?
[16:26:45] <huf> this thing keeps changing
[16:26:47] <kill-animals> You are. you admitted it.
[16:26:52] <kill-animals> Why deny it?
[16:26:58] <huf> am I denying it?
[16:27:10] <kurahaupo> kill-animals: being "left" or "right" depends on whom you're comparing against
[16:27:11] <kill-animals> By asking questions like you do, you are.
[16:27:18] <huf> how?
[16:27:22] <huf> btw, new claim again
[16:27:32] <huf> now you have to prove this one, since you've failed at the previous ones

[16:29:14] <kill-animals> see with both of you, what you do, is you never play your cards on the table, and are never frank about what your position is, so you can go, "W-w-well where did I say I was lfet wing? W-w-when did I say I didnt say that wikipedia is n-n-not biased? b-but the original question was about both founders not one founder"
[16:29:33] <kill-animals> its dumb.

[16:33:32] <kill-animals> >uhhh? yeah, chocolate cake is your favourite.

[16:34:00] <kill-animals> >But you told me that it was your favourite

[16:35:01] <twb> kill-animals: are you saying your initial claim (wikipedia is unreliable for politicial statements) is merely your unfounded personal opinion?

[16:35:44] <kill-animals> >Dude chocolare cake is your favourite. Your mom even says so
[16:36:00] <kill-animals> >>uhhh just because its my favourite, does not prove its actually the best. 
[16:36:04] <kurahaupo> kill-animals:I think your chocolate cake analogy has become a bit farfetched
[16:36:08] <kill-animals> >yeah okay immanuel kant
[16:36:26] <kurahaupo> My favourite is fruit cake, ftr
[16:36:38] <kill-animals> kurahaupo: Christmas fruit cake?
[16:36:45] <kurahaupo> Yes
[16:37:00] <twb> kill-animals: did you know chocolate industry has been claiming for 25 years that they'll stop using child slave labour "real soon now"
[16:37:05] <kill-animals> I have an affinity for strawberry short cake. Fruitcake is certainly a more mature and refined taste.
[16:37:10] <twb> Er, sorry that was for kurahaupo
[16:37:55] <kill-animals> twb: Child slave labour. Isnt this just a milton friedman argument?
[16:39:23] <kurahaupo> More the "have you stopped beating your wife" kind of question
[16:39:33] <twb> kill-animals: sorry, I'm not familiar with their work.
[16:39:42] <kill-animals> To depart from this. For what its worth, the right has divided itself into two portions now in regards why child slave labour and suh exists. One bases it on economics, such as Ben Shapiro and company, and the other looks towards race, such as Nick Fuentes and Company. 
[16:39:52] <kurahaupo> twb: Friedman was an economist
[16:40:46] <kill-animals> twb: milton friedman is a bit of a meme on the right at this point. He made these really interesting videos on the free market during the 80s and would laud the efforts of places like Hong Kong, and defend sweat shops and the like
[16:41:48] <kill-animals> Neo conservatives hate him. Libertarians love him. Reactionaries are think its dumb yet valid. 
[16:42:01] <kurahaupo> kill-animals: The whole notion that there is a unidimensional separation between left & right seems crazy to me; we have many orthogonal questions to disagree upon
[16:42:43] <twb> I'm not sure where your Overton window lies, but I'm guessing every part of your political spectrum is economically liberal and socially conservative from my perspective.
[16:43:00] <twb> kurahaupo: well OBVIOUSLY "right wing" means pro-Bourbon and "left wing" means regicidal.
[16:43:02] <kill-animals> kurahaupo: What does orthogonal mean?

[16:44:56] <kurahaupo> kill-animals: is that definition sufficient?
[16:44:57] <kill-animals> twb: My views changed rather signifiantly in the past. I used to be a harsh libertarian, but after hearing some of the rhetoric from their right wing detractors, and the fact that the Libertarians refused to engage, like what happened during groyper wars, my views began to shift. 
[16:45:28] <kill-animals> kurahaupo: seperate basically?
[16:45:40] <twb> So basically you switched from right wing group A to right wing group B
[16:46:44] <kurahaupo> True libertarians are centrists, because they want neither left nor right wing governments to intrude on their liberty

[16:47:29] <kill-animals> kurahaupo: Interesting thought. When I think of centrists, I think of guys like sargon of akkad. Who do you think of?
[16:47:38] <huf> sargon the centrist? my word 
[16:48:10] <kurahaupo> I'm not in the US so I have no idea who those names are
[16:48:25] <kill-animals> kurahaupo: Sargon is from the UK.
[16:48:48] <huf> kill-animals: US ancaps stole the libertarian label from anarchists just like they stole the label anarcho- from anarchists

[16:48:55] <kill-animals> he is a bit of a youtube phenomenon but like 5 of his channels got banned so good chance no one has heard from him.
[16:49:13] <kill-animals> huf: Okay orwell
[16:49:23] <kurahaupo> But Pen Gillette comes to mind as an example of a centrist libertarian
[16:49:35] <huf> kurahaupo: so "libertarian" has a fairly unpredictable meaning to people
[16:49:40] <kill-animals> kurahaupo: oof yes. Atheist too
[16:49:59] <huf> though, this is generally true of these words
[16:50:09] <kurahaupo> kill-animals: you make it sound like atheist is unusual somehow
[16:50:11] <huf> "left" can mean anything from right wing neolibs to actual communists 
[16:50:14] <huf> depending on who's talking
[16:50:35] <kill-animals> kurahaupo: Penn Gillette is a cringe atheist, like dawkins and harris.

[16:56:44] <furrykef> kinda sorta
[16:57:38] <kill-animals> furrykef: Basically it would be like, if you were invited to a family dinner, and your 17 year old cousin was there, and he was an atheist, and he wore a fedora and a trench coat
[16:57:40] <furrykef> Not as bad about libertarianism, I mean
[16:58:46] <kill-animals> And aunt peggy was sad, and she said that uncle sam had passed on, and we should pray for him. And your cousin pipes up, "Praying wont do anything" -- "... why?" -- "because god is as real as the flying spaghetti monster" *mic drop*

[23:31:43] * LuisP14 wondering why you your task, doesn't make sense to me
[23:31:54] <LiberationArmy> Hey guys!
[23:31:56] <LiberationArmy> What's going on?

[23:33:30] <pussipupu> "you" and "your task" are objects of the verb
[23:33:40] <blkshp> The consuption of Hydrogen Dioxide 
[23:33:41] * LiberationArmy wonders why anybody would want to use anything but Ruby
[23:33:55] <LiberationArmy> It's like Python, but modernized and supersimplified
[23:34:00] <LiberationArmy> Like English => American
[23:34:02] <blkshp> Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, ahh ah ah ahhh ah ahhhhhh
[23:34:06] <LiberationArmy> Or Danish => Norwegian
[23:34:19] <pussipupu> "Like Python"isn't a selling point
[23:34:38] <pussipupu> and AmE isn't more modern or simpler than other English dialects
[23:34:48] <LiberationArmy> pussipupu: True, everybody knows Python. Nobody knows Ruby.
[23:34:58] <LuisP14> i mean, you is already filling the role
[23:36:07] <pussipupu> it's ditransitive
[23:36:33] <pussipupu> Like "give" in the other example
[23:36:44] <LuisP14> then that means an io
[23:37:58] <LuisP14> lol, so i guess the envy is on them instead of towards them
[23:38:28] <pussipupu> I have no idea what you mean by that so no comment
[23:38:54] <LuisP14> io indirect object, heh

[23:51:01] <LuisM14> no worries
[23:52:08] <pussipupu> I suspect you're misunderstanding something to be honest, bit it's not clear what your opinion is, so...:p
