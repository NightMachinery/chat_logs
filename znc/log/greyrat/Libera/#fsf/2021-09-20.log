[02:38:51] <kaiod> but, honestly, I think it's still possible to talk to the Ubuntu community and see these issues that prevent it from being 100% libre.

[02:41:02] <pert> kaiod: I wasn't here for the prior discussion, but have you considered if you want to get a different wireless card? If you could afford it, it would help show demand for libre products and improve the odds of us having libre cards going into the future.
[02:41:03] <Bronzu> I wish you good luck, where you connected to this channel a few hours ago?
[02:43:59] <kaiod> pert, in this case, my wireless card is very good, buying a more expensive one would be a bit difficult, since the price list in the USA and Brazil are different.

[02:52:12] <joepublic> well, 7baaf7 notwithstanding, that's still us$5.
[02:54:25] <kaiod> ,7BAAF7Because, what happens in Brazil, when you buy something abroad, on the internet, there is a fee (for the conversion from real to dollar), then you will buy the board, it can be 5 dollars, but the shipping is ,7BAAF7very expensive. Considering these factors, it can reach up to 50 reais, and this is expensive.

[04:10:08] <kaiod> ,7BAAF7For the simple fact that firstly, I'm sure that nothing is being done by FSFLA in Brazil, and secondly, because I see that the situation here has reached gigantic proportions, and it is ,7BAAF7when it comes to organizing locally, guaranteeing our space and holding debates with associations and unions, while we can still guarantee the education and privacy of the Brazilian people.

[04:12:42] <kaiod> ,7BAAF7If you say that there is no guarantee, it is because it just shows that the situation is very difficult and that we must take action
[04:12:44] <iShareFreedom> You can't ask for something in your country, if you haven't started contributing voluntarily, or as a member because otherwise you can't know what software activists do, because if you knew it, you'd know about what we're doing, and you'd realize it's unnecessary to have a fsf per country.
[04:13:27] <iShareFreedom> the actions are free, never imposed for this reason even if there are 30 fsf in brazil there is no guarantee that it is effective, only look at united states, which is where the fsf was born.
[04:15:12] <kaiod> ,7BAAF7In truth I am an engaged member in Brazil, however, there is a lack of local organization, this is a fact. There are laws that are not complied with, there is a portal for free software that is not good, the movements want ,7BAAF7pay attention, but there is nothing, so there are several aspects that show that this is necessary, including for registration in court. 
[04:15:27] <iShareFreedom> So, how do we make it effective, by making more fsf in the world? Of course not! But how do we do it? The answer is: volunteer for Free Software, work distributing it and teaching the philosophy locally, join your local libreplanet free software community group. And if it still exists, start it.
[04:16:28] <iShareFreedom> If you are not organized, and have not seen anything on libreplanet, you should start your local activist team. Don't wait for others to do it for you. Then you could start a good committed team.
[04:17:19] <iShareFreedom> Don't wait for others to organize for you, if you wait for that it will be too late, today starts your way to organize your libreplanet team locally, if you haven't joined one yet.
[04:17:26] <iShareFreedom> i recommend you join to #libreplanet
[04:18:33] <iShareFreedom> and here kaiod you can join/create a libreplanet in a local way https://libreplanet.org/wiki/LibrePlanet:Teams

[04:19:15] <kaiod> so, in the thesis, this is something really cool.  but in practice, this is not the case.  no one will give you any real attention if you don't have something solid, that's a fact.  In fact, it's even in a legal context that's good!  after all, why not do an FSF in your country?  if there are conditions, why not do it?  In Brazil, at least, it makes things more tangible and real.
[04:19:23] <iShareFreedom> brasil have 4 libreplanet teams 
[04:20:49] <iShareFreedom> join the local libreplanet team in your country if you want to start integrating with free software activists, before thinking big, better to know how something big works.

[04:23:14] <kaiod> I know there is a libreplanet in Brazil, 3 belonging to cities and one from Brazil, in fact I am a member of Libreplanet Brasil, and of FSF too (paying as a student).
[04:23:56] <kaiod> ,7BAAF7I didn't know they were active yet, I'll go after them now to talk about what, by the way, on the libreplanet page, they put officialization as a task.

[04:25:34] <iShareFreedom> I invite you to participate actively in the local teams, not in the generals, so that you immerse yourself in the action.
[04:26:23] <iShareFreedom> donating with money is support, but there is no greater support than that of activists, who make others hear and promote free software, excluding proprietary software.
[04:34:28] <kaiod> ,7BAAF7I'm already immersed in the action, just not under the name of the FSF, I'm affiliated with the Brazilian Computer Society, I'm a member of the Public Committee of the National Association of Data Protection Professionals (ANPPD), ,7BAAF7and I was recently invited to participate in the National Science and Technology Week of the Federal Institutes of the State of Minas Gerais, on the technological and scientific debate in the 
[04:34:28] <kaiod> educational and student sphere. But I need something more solid for students than just "spread the word", like it or not, it's hard for them. Mainly, those who don't understand ,7BAAF7about that, it's something that takes time, and it needs something structured for that.

[04:57:43] <kaiod> okay, that might work fine in the US or elsewhere, but at least here, it doesn't. People don't like to be that independent, some people do, but people like to work collaboratively in organized groups. If not, they will organize themselves in a union or party, which is the same, but with different names and purposes (sometimes). As I told you, the thesis is great! but practice is not quite like that, there is a lot.

[05:59:54] <Hash> Hey
[06:00:05] <Hash> I need a software recommendation, 100% free
[06:00:09] <Hash> not cost, but free.
[06:00:12] <Hash> Psychedelicsdaily.com has a lot of traffic and I just don't know how to send mobile/desktop peopel in the most easiest way into a GNU open free software solution for live chat.
[06:00:29] <Hash> I have #psychedelics here but ... I know the moment you mix 'mobile' the options for freedom becomes limited.
[06:00:42] <Hash> But a lot of people use mobile according to analytics and I'm just not sure what to do
[06:01:14] <Hash> I need a live chat integration for a website, and I need it to be totally open and free, no proprietary nonsense.
[06:04:51] <DiffieHellman> You want something in a browser, or?
[06:07:11] <Hash> No outside of browser, something that even phone/mobile users can easily use to connect
[06:07:25] <iShareFreedom> you say without cost same?
[06:07:41] <iShareFreedom> without price?
[06:07:43] <Hash> DiffieHellman: btw, your nickanme is key exchange, there is a #websec too for web security
[06:07:49] <Hash> Just needs to be open/free respect freedom
[06:08:01] <Hash> Afterall,l we're takling psychedelic illuminations.
[06:08:07] <iShareFreedom> open source isnt about freedom
[06:08:10] <Hash> Enlightenments, that sort of theme. so freedom.
[06:08:11] <DiffieHellman> DiffieHellman isn't really about key exchange, it's more about key agreement.
[06:08:19] <Hash> I know OSS isn't which is why I specifically said free.
[06:08:31] <Hash> open/cost doesn't concern me so long as it is free, proper free

[06:10:21] <Hash> Or have alink that directs the user offsite into a chat platform?
[06:11:04] <DiffieHellman> irc is really the best way to have a chat tbh. Probably list the channel and that's it's on liberachat and also include a link to a webchat/
[06:11:11] <Hash> I mean, easiest thing to do is to offer a live irc connection web GUI to connect to #psychedelics here?

[06:17:34] <Hash> So i took it off. i use ejabberdb
[06:17:55] <DiffieHellman> A lot, but they're still both terrible and don't seem to have decent clients.
