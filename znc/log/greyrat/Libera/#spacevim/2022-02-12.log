[11:08:41] <SpaceVimBot_> <sisrnb> Hi all, I have a question: why SpaceVim changes default setting of showcmd?
[11:09:47] <SpaceVimBot_> <sisrnb> I accustomed to use default setting of showcmd.
[11:14:39] <SpaceVimBot_> <sisrnb> I persionally think it's better to not change some default behaviors.
[11:14:40] <SpaceVimBot_> <sisrnb> 
[11:14:41] <SpaceVimBot_> <sisrnb> I found 'set noshowcmd' is set in ~/.SpaceVim/autoload/SpaceVim/default.vim.
