[09:08:11] <tinyweasel> but yeah, if you cut out postfix or the like, you can push out thouands of emails per minute

[10:19:06] <xaltsc> Hey, I'm trying to figure out a way to get my mail synced across many computers, with the notmuch metadata. Any idea how I might acheive this ? I have a server so I plan to store my maildirs there, but I need to have offline access.
[10:31:06] *** Joins: vit (~vit@chello085216193138.chello.sk)
[10:31:47] <pj> xaltsc: generally the way to get offline access is to configure your MUA to download and store the messages offline.  The reason to have multiple mailstores is generally for high availability or load balancing.
[10:33:45] <xaltsc> pj: Yeah, that's what I already have. The difficulty here is to sync notmuch metadata
[10:35:44] <pj> xaltsc: I don't follow, how would expect to sync without the metadata?
[10:36:12] <xaltsc> pj: Using standard imap stuff

[13:49:14] <tinyweasel> so, I wrote something that does direct MX, and all, but erh, I'm not seeing the results when doing a lot of mailing to email addresses
[13:49:37] <tinyweasel> basically, I look up the MX record, cache it, and then send off an email using DATA (HELO with system rDNS)
[13:49:44] <tinyweasel> then QUIT
[13:50:05] <tinyweasel> I don't know if it's the wait group function I'm using, or if it's because the sender IPs are not clean
[14:01:56] <Khepra> probably abuse of the SMTP protocol since you're missing at least two commands between helo and data.
[14:02:29] <pj> Not to mention loads of response handling, etc.  I know of one group of people that try to push out mail that way ... spammers.
[14:02:37] <tinyweasel> oh, I'm doing mail from and rcpt to, too
[14:03:01] <tinyweasel> then DATA, SUBJECT, FROM, then a ., before doing QUIT
[14:03:20] <tinyweasel> *FROM, message body,
[14:03:23] <Khepra> well, tiny weasel here has already been established as a spammer, that's not a secret :)
[14:04:22] <tinyweasel> yeah, the code is all fine
[14:04:28] <tinyweasel> I checked it, before, I think it's just the IPs
[14:04:43] <Khepra> if subject and from are the only headers you're using, that's gonna flag flags
[14:05:28] <tinyweasel> hmm, it did work with my postfix server
[14:05:53] <tinyweasel> in that, I tested out that code with my own server, just to see whether it'd get through, and it did, although, my own server doesn't even have an antispam filter
[14:06:56] <Khepra> problem is.... you didn't even say what the problem was. you did direct MX, talked some SMTP, aaaaand... what with it?
[14:07:55] <tinyweasel> Oh, well, right, yeah, I should probably test it out with a bunch of local mail servers in my LAN, but I think it was a problem with the thread pool code
[14:08:31] <tinyweasel> because I just wasn't seeing the emails getting through to one of my own mail lists
[14:08:50] <tinyweasel> well, I'll go and debug more, and see
[14:11:23] <Khepra> I wonder; other than "Achievement unlocked in writing my own MTA" ... what's the purpose of all this? Even if you really are a realy deal mcneal spammer. that'd be terribly inefficient. because you can just install proper, RFC respecting tools (say, postfix) and use it just fine to send ton of solicited or unsolicited email, while retaining technical legitimacy and maximizing performance.
[14:12:18] <tinyweasel> right, yeah, but I'd have to deal with dynamically generated postfix configs, etc
[14:12:23] <tinyweasel> and then it's not really portable
[14:13:56] <pj> I'm surprised this hasn't been done already, but better late than never ...
