[03:01:10] <e36freak> you should probably use a while read loop over a for loop there
[03:01:37] <e36freak> just pipe find | sort | while read -r repo; do ...
[03:01:54] <e36freak> at least it'll be safe for filenames with spaces or other special characters in them, where the for loop is not
[03:02:01] <e36freak> !for$(
[03:02:02] <greybot> Never do this: for x in $(command) or `command` or $var. for-in is used for iterating arguments, not (output) strings. Instead, use a glob (eg. *.txt), arrays (eg. "${names[@]}") or a while-read loop (eg. while read -r line). See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls#pf1 and http://mywiki.wooledge.org/DontReadLinesWithFor

[03:57:16] <doug16k> ash_worksi, technically, they are case sensitive, but tons of stuff capitalizes it like "Content-Type", so I suggest you do that to help existing broken code work
[03:57:59] <doug16k> I mean in general
[03:58:12] <doug16k> not exactly curl
[03:59:03] <ash_worksi> thanks doug16k 
[03:59:08] <doug16k> omg. I meant case INsensitive
[04:00:56] <j416> ash_worksi: Camel-Case is for HTTP/1.1; camel-case is for HTTP/2. Servers should not care.

[04:06:27] <doug16k> case-insentitive != camel case
[04:06:41] <doug16k> but broken code might need it
[04:06:50] <j416> not sure what you mean
[04:07:13] <doug16k> broken code might look for exactly "Content-Type", case sensitive
[04:07:29] <j416> and that won't work in http/2
[04:07:45] <doug16k> I'm not talking about http/2
[04:08:04] <j416> but, a lot of the web is http/1.1 so, there's that.
[04:08:13] <doug16k> what does http/2 have to do with curl headers?
[04:08:36] <doug16k> curl headers means, you are doing a request to a potentially asinine rest request handler, so you should coddle it
[04:09:21] <doug16k> hand made one where the person that wrote it hardly knew the difference between a path and a query and a header
[04:10:06] <doug16k> potentially

[16:18:27] <pj> it seems like I can check $POSIXLY_CORRECT but other shells don't set that, so it's not a reliable way to tell if it's POSIX, or do I have to check both $BASH_VERSION and $POSIXLY_CORRECT to know for sure?
