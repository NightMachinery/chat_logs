[10:08:44] <velix> I'm really having a bad time with creating a GIT repository for our team. For example, we're creating maps, which are placed in TeX documents later. For the maps, Python code and database stuff is needed. Do I setup a new repository for all the different parts or do I setup a monolith?
[10:09:27] <velix> Repositories like "maps-rendering", "geodata-processing", "tex-publishing" ?
[10:09:47] <velix> or a project repository "report" with subdirectores "maps-rendering" etc.?
[10:09:51] <velix> But this messes up history :D
[10:10:05] <velix> I've seen other doing it in branches. but this might also mess up history.
[10:10:20] <velix> and lead to huge repositories, of course.

[10:26:47] <igemnace> velix: well, i've never been in that exact situation before (generators and generated data), just in situations with some similarity. it's really your call. look into a trend called "monorepos" to see pros & cons of having it in a single repository
[10:26:51] <j416> velix: think about the dependency structure. How do these relate to one another? Do you need to keep them in sync? Do you often do changes across many of them at the same time?

[10:28:04] <igemnace> my personal take for that would be to have the generated data in a different git repo at least. you don't really expect the generators to care about the history of generated data, so anything from monorepos to submodules are a bit unfit, i think. subtrees could do, but that would entail checking in the generated data in the same repo, which again, isn't really something that affects the history of the
[10:28:06] <igemnace> generators

[10:37:54] <igemnace> ah alright, i misunderstood. then yes, it's really your call. j416's response has a set of great questions to determine whether having it in a single repo would be advantageous
[10:38:59] <velix> j416: They strongly relate to each other and they need to be kept in sync. During the initial development they're changed damn often, but later only hardly. But when they're edited, all need to be in sync.

[10:41:14] <igemnace> velix: that sounds more like a vague description of submodules. a monorepo is just a single repository spanning a lot of interrelated projects/codebases. usually made by having them be subdirectories of the root of the repository

[10:45:02] <velix> igemnace: Oh, I missunderstood it then. I thought submodules need to be imported, while monorepos contain them by default.
[10:45:39] <velix> Actually, I'm using Github Teams. I can bundle many repositories there into a project. This helps me right now.
[10:46:01] <velix> I've got 5 separate repos belonging to the report. And "report" is the project.
[10:46:08] <velix> And only those 5 repos are listed in this project.
[10:46:18] <velix> This keeps the mess small.
[10:46:52] <velix> But I was reading about a test repo from Facebook: 4 million commits, 15 GB in size. Heck :D
[10:46:57] <velix> I don't want to end with that.
[10:47:24] <igemnace> ah, alright, that works. but just for clarity, i was using "project" in the sense that its a self-contained set of files, not Github Projects
[10:47:48] <velix> sure.
[10:49:02] <velix> I mean, a big problem of multiple repositories might be tests...

[18:09:49] <lpapp> osse: exactly, sounds like a feature request?
[18:10:20] <osse> would be nice if git mv 'foo/private*' 'bar/private' worked
[18:10:29] <lpapp> also, I still need to remove foo/private manually, so it is not really a move.
[18:10:45] <lpapp> I think global is a hack, personally.
[18:10:47] <lpapp> a workaround
[18:10:59] <lpapp> we could have an --append or something to git mv in worst case.

[18:14:39] <lpapp> but bar already has private implementation
[18:14:49] <osse> how you got the error
[18:15:04] <lpapp> it is because bar/private already exists with some files in there
[18:15:20] <lpapp> so moving foo/private recursively to bar/private is rejected by git mv, apparently.

[18:56:39] <cheakoirccloud> Tangent to what I was talking about a week ago.  Would it not be useful if a commit could be notated that it fixes a bug, with a *severity, in a previous commit.  * Also something preventing ppl from needing to do 10, 20, 30 so that later they can introduce 12...  Perhaps not a number but a hierarchy.  I know there is `git notes`, but do we really want to start having ppl putting JSON, YAML or XML in notes?

[19:01:18] *** Joins: ghost43 (~ghost43@gateway/tor-sasl/ghost43)
[19:01:46] <cheakoirccloud> I think it should be visible in `git log`, unless you think that the logs should always be read online...

[19:03:36] <cheakoirccloud> I think there are a number of cases where git being intelligent about where bugs are introduced and fixed would be nice.
[19:04:34] <mackerman> If you want to put structued data in git notes,  do that
[19:04:52] <canton7> cheakoirccloud, this isn't how most people do it -- most people have an issue tracker (of varying complexity) where initial triage happens, then prioritisation, estimation, planning, assignment, notes, comments, test outputs, etc etc, are stored. A ticket is linked to a commit by mentioning it in the commit message, and UIs let you click through
[19:04:52] <canton7> from the issue ID to the page on the issue tracker
[19:05:19] <canton7> Git is a small part of a large ecosystem, which also includes an issue tracker, CI/CD, requirements management, documentation, test plans and output, etc etc

[19:07:39] <cheakoirccloud> My assertion is that the git command itself can smartly use this information.
[19:07:40] <mackerman> An analogy: this is like expecting a published book's  table of contents to be updated every time an error is found
[19:08:13] <mackerman> It can be changed, but the expectation is that a given "books"  "edition" is static.  Same with  git history.
[19:08:17] <cheakoirccloud> mackerman: Yeah, why can't we have that?
[19:08:38] <mackerman> So "scribbling in the margins" would be  git notes, or something that doesn't need to change the commits
[19:08:42] <canton7> cheakoirccloud, mine is that it doesn't and shouldn't. If you want to hack something together, by all means, but I wouldn't expect support from elsewhere
[19:08:44] <cheakoirccloud> Books should just come on a tablet, if for this reason alone.
[19:08:53] <mackerman> Its not the best analogy.

[19:12:03] <canton7> It's more the case that other tools can use git log, and also source the related information, to create a richer log-viewing experience which contains both the git log, and information from the linked issue, and outputs from CI/CD, etc.
[19:12:16] <canton7> This is what tools like GitHub/GitLab do
[19:13:15] <canton7> Sure you could create a command-line version of this, but noone has so far, and I suspect the reason is that users like to be able to navigate around this information -- see a commit, see that CI failed, click through to see what the failure was -- and that's not as practical on the command line
[19:13:16] <mackerman> The wiki has a list of several issue trackers that use git as storage  https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Interfaces,_frontends,_and_tools#Bug.2Fissue_trackers.2C_etc.

[21:09:56] <ba> I'm trying to write something that will convert an old VCS to Git by feeding data into `git fast-import`. My exporter issues `blob` commands for all the files, then `commit` commands for all the changes. The `commit` commands use `filedelete` and `filemodify` but not `filedeletall`. My mark IDs are the MD5 sums of file contents. My question/problem: when imported, the git history shows file deletions and additions but *no modifications*. I'm 90% sure this is a subtle
[21:09:56] <ba> bug in my exporter, but I just wanted to ask this channel if `git fast-import` not seeing modifications is something that might ring a bell.

[21:51:26] <ba> Just spotted this in the git-fast-import docs: "Marks are stored in a sparse array, using 1 pointer (4 bytes or 8 bytes, depending on pointer size) per mark. Although the array is sparse, frontends are still strongly encouraged to use marks between 1 and n, where n is the total number of marks required for this import.". I wonder if using md5sums is tripping it up, will try using sequential IDs

[22:42:53] <ba> Yay, that solved it! TL;DR: don't use hash digests as mark IDs when feeding data into `git-fast-import` - use sequential IDs instead.
