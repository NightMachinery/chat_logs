[07:42:24] <youmustrust> Hi, guys. I just found an AAC frame with 1152 samples in it, with the help of `ffprobe -show_frames ...`. I always thought an AAC frame would have 1024 samples in it, but I must be mistaken. Is there any way to find out sample count programmatically from bitstream without ffmpeg decoding? I don't think `Audio Specific Config` has any information about sample count. =/
[07:44:23] <youmustrust> I'm currently calculating outbound timestamps in my application so that it take consideration into the number of sample count in a AAC packet. Any AAC stream with other than 1024 samples would break this calculation. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
[07:45:02] <kepstin> aac audio frames are fixed 1024 samples, note that ffprobe "-show_frames" shows ffmpeg's internal AVFrames that are the output of the decoder, and don't directly correspond to audio codec bitstream frames
[07:46:40] <youmustrust> kepstin: Aha! Thanks a million!
[07:46:42] <kepstin> you might want -show_packets instead?
[07:46:57] <youmustrust> Have a wonderful wonderful day.
[07:47:47] <youmustrust> Oh I actually tried that, but `-show_frames` concerned me. But, since it's an internal value for ffmpeg, that must be okay. =)
[07:47:49] <kepstin> do be aware that aac requires priming samples, which aren't typically a multiple of aac's frame size. e.g. 2112 priming samples is common.
[07:48:24] <kepstin> so the samples that you send to / get from the codec aren't necessarily aligned to packet frames. I dunno the details on that, heh
[07:48:55] <youmustrust> =) wow. Thanks for that, too. I totally need to check on that!
[07:50:43] <kepstin> when you're encoding audio, the encoder should automatically add the priming samples before starting to feed the audio you provide to the encoder. When decoding… i'm not sure, i think in most cases there's supposed to be some metadata indicating how many samples you should ignore/drop from the start.
[07:52:48] <youmustrust> Hmm, so that priming samples are like headers, right? They don't appear in the middle of normal packets?
[07:53:12] <kepstin> no, not in the middle. https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/QuickTime/QTFF/QTFFAppenG/QTFFAppenG.html is actually a good reference for that
[07:53:23] <youmustrust> =D

[20:05:39] <Keshl> Oh hey, people are saying stuff! -- I have a weird situation and I'm very sure it's a pebkac. When I run a command with two generative filterchains, such as showwaves and showspectrum, they randomly (but consistently) drop frames (as verified by pressing "e" in VLC to advance exactly one frame), even if I carefully set r in each filter, and -r at the end. If I generate the filters individually one at a time, they appear at the correct rate. If I
[20:05:40] <Keshl> generate them, save them all to different files, and then try to bring them together with multiple -i and only use hstack/vstack/etc, the original issue somehow appears again! What's going on? https://crypt.is-by.us/?07811ac1900fe1a7#bfa+LjzzNhjH2lUz0ZHxr5lAnCifrEiVxuhzaSBXzyQ=

[20:28:16] <Keshl> To confirm, it's just [in]fps=fps=120[out]; , right?
[20:28:57] <kepstin> to add it to your filter chain, i'd do something like showspectrum=[...],fps=120
[20:34:13] <Keshl> I changed the spectrum lines to [0:a]showspectrum=mode=combined:color=intensity:scale=cbrt:s=840x384:slide=scroll:fscale=lin,fps=120[linspec];  , but get the same output. No -r at the end. ffmpeg isn't reporting dropped/dupped frames, but playing back frame by frame shows there definitely are on a per-filter basis, while this isn't the case if I do the filters by themselves. Also, now, without -r, ffmpeg decides to go into an infinite loop at the end
[20:34:15] <Keshl> and eats all my memory and swap in about ten seconds once the input ends, despite -shortest being specified.
[20:37:15] <Keshl> Oh right, one second, I tried this in -v debug and got a weird message from it earlier, let me find it..
[20:38:01] <Keshl> "cur_dts is invalid st:0 (0) [init:0 i_done:0 finish:0] (this is harmless if it occurs once at the start per stream)" -- This happens thousands of times on each stream, and typically occurs at least once on each frame, but sometimes twice.

[21:40:50] <DeHackEd> is there some options I can provide to massively speed up h264 decoding? the goal is to confirm a video file isn't corrupted in some subtle way, but keep CPU usage as low as as I can get away with?
[21:42:16] <JEEB> not really, since the speed-up generally are about skipping decoding of something
[21:42:20] <JEEB> and if you want to check that something
[21:42:25] <JEEB> then skipping the decoding is not good

[21:49:28] <jkqxz> DeHackEd:  Skipping deblocking doesn't affect anything else if you don't care about the output pictures - see the "skip_loop_filter" option.  The gain is not massive, though.
[21:49:31] <DeHackEd> right, for a file on disk it would be a speed thing since ffmpeg just runs as fast as psosible
[21:51:34] <DeHackEd> that would be the sort of thing I'm looking at...  cutting decoding time/usage in half would be good
[21:53:10] <JEEB> using nice for giving it cpu (de)priority, as well as limiting threads
[21:53:21] <JEEB> if you have a multi-NUMA node thing, you can also bind the process to a specific NUMA node
[21:55:08] <DeHackEd> oh yeah dual-socket systems have double the memory latency or so going to the wrong socket. cpuset cgroup is how I'm managing that
[21:57:07] <DeHackEd> problem is this is going to be a part of an existing app. setting a thread as low priority should be doable I think, but ultimately the actual feed is realtime and I don't want it to fall behind much
[21:57:43] <JEEB> well, there's no magic
[21:58:34] <JEEB> hwaccels are the only way I can think of you being able to go faster without magic, but then again doing decode verification with hwaccel is a bit iffy. may work, though
[21:58:46] <JEEB> if you don't have hwaccel, then I don't know what to say
[21:58:49] <DeHackEd> true, but I only need to know if a "standby/backup" feed is sane. I'd prefer a full-ish decode to make sure the feed is actually good
[21:58:57] <DeHackEd> no there's no hardware acceleration available
[21:59:09] <JEEB> so yea, there's no magic
[21:59:25] <JEEB> you can skip stuff like non-reference frame decoding, but then you actually skip that stuff
[21:59:32] <JEEB> also it probably won't speed things up /that/ much

[22:53:23] <Kizano> I could get it to fade, but I wanted to try to make it roll down like it's doing in the video, but without the background overwrite.
[22:54:48] <Kizano> I feel like xfade could work if i could get the PNG to come back transparent.
[22:54:53] <Kizano> Any ideas?
[22:56:43] <JEEB> also `-v verbose` will log a lot of the details for the filter chain pixel format wise etc. but in general, I'd recommend testing current master since you don't even have to build it yourself if you're on 64bit linux or windows (Btbn's automated builds that I linked), you can just extract and pass the full path to the ffmpeg binary)
[22:56:54] <JEEB> then if it still fails, you have done a pretty good explanation of the use case
[22:57:23] <JEEB> but I would still kind of recommend pasting the full log with `-v verbose` added with master

Now showwaves only registers a new frame once every 3 frames, sometimes once every 2. Showspec is also acting really weird. avscope is pretty sane except when it's occasionally not.
[23:02:35] <Kizano> JEEB, here's output with verbose https://pastebin.com/YsSF25ig
[23:02:51] <Kizano> I have to use "q" to exit early or else it gets stuck trying to process the last few frames on 00:00:03.09
[23:02:58] <Kizano> before it could finish with the effect.
[23:02:59] <JEEB> hide_banner hides the version unfortunately
[23:03:04] <Kizano> derp
[23:03:11] <JEEB> so I cannot verify which build you're running with
[23:03:17] <Kizano> <Kizano> ffmpeg-4.3.1-4ubuntu1 is current version
[23:03:31] <JEEB> right, that is why my first thing was to point you towards Btbn's automated builds
[23:03:37] <JEEB> master, gpl, not shared
[23:03:44] <JEEB> extract and utilize full path to the included "ffmpeg"
[23:04:02] <JEEB> master is the one with just N-something instead of 4.4
[23:04:06] <Kizano> hrmm... okay, will try
[23:04:10] <JEEB> cheers
[23:04:10] <Kizano> was xfade updated in this build?
[23:04:18] <JEEB> 4.3 is pretty old
[23:04:23] <JEEB> I think 4.4 by now is like a year old
[23:04:32] <durandal_1707> Kizano: why you need xfade update?
[23:04:53] <JEEB> so I'm in general trying to help you first verify with current master

[23:05:05] <JEEB> and then if the problem still happens it's not fixed by a simple update
[23:05:32] <durandal_1707> Keshl: do note that if you do not use height power of 2 showspectrum filter will crop higher frequency content
[23:05:35] <Kizano> durandal_1707, asking for context. if that part of the code wasn't touched, then I'm more likely to suspect my config is wrong somewhere...
[23:05:56] <Kizano> JEEB, classic support question I should have already tried - derp
[23:06:09] <Kizano> I thought I was running off my local build, not the apt-get version
[23:06:13] <durandal_1707> Kizano: how could i know, post command line that does not work
[23:06:21] <JEEB> he did in the pastebin
[23:06:27] <JEEB> so that part he did
[23:06:39] <JEEB> anyways, durandal_1707 made a lot of changes in xfade in 2020
[23:07:41] <JEEB> and yea, april 2020 commit was the last one that seems to precede n4.3, which is the branch you're on
[23:07:42] <Keshl> durandal_1707: Thank you, I was wondering why it did weird stuff sometimes. Still, again, even when not using showspectrum, this happens.
[23:08:14] <Kizano> aaaah
[23:08:15] <Kizano> good to know!
[23:08:48] <durandal_1707> only more transitions were added
[23:09:03] <JEEB> I have no idea if those changes are relevant to you, or if there's some other major libavfilter related change that might help you etc in general. it's just worth updating to master in general if you're going to try and diagnose a bug :P
[23:09:06] <durandal_1707> dunno about alpha stuff
[23:10:02] <Kizano> LoL, yep
[23:10:09] <durandal_1707> Kizano: ahh, xfade does not work with alpha formats at all
[23:10:25] <durandal_1707> so you need to add it with alphamerge instead
[23:10:46] <Kizano> hrmm.. okay - but that won't give the `wipedown' effect I wanted either, would it? :pleading:
[23:10:48] <durandal_1707> or you need alpha plane to also have transition?
[23:10:54] <Kizano> gaah... too much Discord, LoL
[23:11:09] <Kizano> I wanted the wipedown effect so it's like I'm wiping the paper into the frame
[23:11:59] <durandal_1707> wipedown transition does that with 2 inputs
[23:12:11] <durandal_1707> both inputs must be animated somehow

[23:15:22] <Kizano> almost like I'm missing qscale ?
[23:15:32] <Kizano> anyways, i'll figure out the video quality later.
[23:15:43] <Kizano> let me try this again once more to get some data about latest version + xfade
[23:15:54] <Kizano> then, I'll follow durandal_1707's suggestion to try to animate the PNG first and xfade that.
[23:16:18] <Kizano> I thought it would be a simple merge function like xfade, but I guess I would have to create something like a GIF/MP4 out of the PNG/paper image rolling down.

[23:23:13] <Kizano> aah, ok - so looking at the docs a bit more durandal_1707 - seems like I can use the -vf loop as a filter/filter_complex instead of as a cmd argument?
[23:23:23] <durandal_1707> yea, i added that because people tried to xfade inputs of different fps
[23:24:01] <durandal_1707> so to xfade inputs now, you need to have all inputs have same frame rate  and time base
[23:24:24] <durandal_1707> otherwise transition would not be as expected
[23:24:41] <Kizano> MP4 is 29.97 FPS
[23:24:52] <Kizano> fps=fps=29.97 <- image should be getting this in the filter_complex as well
