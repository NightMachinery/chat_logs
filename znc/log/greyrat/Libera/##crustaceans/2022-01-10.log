[00:24:48] <manicennui> Holy shit. The guy who started America's Test Kitchen (and Cook's Illustrated) left and formed a new company that did similar things. He was sued by ATK for doing what every fucking cooking show/magazine out there does (fucking bullshit), but the real kicker: "He was further sued by his ex-wife Adrienne who alleged his departure from Cook's Illustrated devalued the company and affected his payments to her"

[18:05:47] <prussian> companion_cube: I'm guessing something something dependabot
[18:05:57] <companion_cube> :D … like with auto-merge?
[18:06:04] <prussian> or they didn't lock it hard enough or whatever, since it was a patch version
[18:06:06] <prussian> probably
[18:06:08] <prussian> idk
[18:06:22] <prussian> I always use exact version numbers and yarn since i learned about yarn
[18:06:41] <prussian> haven't been left-padded or faker'd out yet, but I'm sort of swerving all of js as of late.
[18:07:27] <gwozniak> To me, deploying anything without fixing the version numbers just seems like pure negligence
[18:07:47] <prussian> this
[18:08:29] <prussian> I get what "semver" is and all, but I still won't accept any increment without explicitly fixing to the newest patch/minor version myself.
[18:09:07] <gwozniak> Or testing it, because semver doesn't seem to work all that great
[18:09:30] <companion_cube> ah yeah, if the guy fucked shit up in a patch release it makes more sense.

[18:13:32] <gwozniak> lol
[18:13:57] <gwozniak> The sports card market has been ruined by cryptobros, apparently
[18:14:12] <gerikson> yeah that's my reading too
[18:14:34] <gwozniak> They drive the price up on cards that have no business being that valuable, mostly to one-up someone else on how much money they are spending
[18:14:56] <gerikson> it's called "flex" apparently
[18:15:01] <gwozniak> "Satch & Me"
[18:17:27] <gwozniak> I guess there are sports cards that contain some fabric from jerseys worn by the players or something like that, and they go for a lot
[18:18:00] <gwozniak> I was told this by a guy who appraised some hockey cards my cousin found
[18:18:00] <gerikson> my stepkid was into that when he was much younger
[18:18:24] <gerikson> he earned some money being on a TV show and frittered it away on that
[18:18:25] <gerikson> :D
[18:18:51] <gwozniak> I used to collect them just because I was into sports and I liked them
[18:19:09] <gwozniak> But seeing them as any kind of investment in the 80s wasn'
[18:19:13] <gwozniak> wasn't really a thing
[18:19:36] <gerikson> are you into sports now?
[18:19:57] <gwozniak> I still follow it a bit, but not at all like I used to
[18:20:31] <gwozniak> My stepuncle is a sportswriter and my cousin was a decent hockey player, so I still keep up with things

[18:20:55] <gerikson> I can watch soccer but never got into hockey
[18:21:42] <gwozniak> Canada == hockey so I was totally into it.  I grew up in the Gretzky era, so it was *the thing* for kids then

[18:29:44] <gwozniak> There was a unique situation in the National Football League yesterday: if the teams in the last game of the year tied, they both made the playoffs.  So there was much discussion about them actually playing to tie
[18:30:49] <gwozniak> Turns out they did not tie, but the team that won (and made the playoffs at the expense of the losing team) did so in overtime
[18:30:57] <gwozniak> So it almost actually happened

[19:42:30] <manicennui> I like how it has become a "fact" because they repeated it enough times.
[19:42:42] <ngoldbaum> i mean this was after starting a fire trying to build IEDs in his queens apartment
[19:43:37] <riv> reminds me of 1984
[19:45:28] <companion_cube> calling people sociopaths because they complained about representation of women in video games: [✔]
[19:46:00] <imode> eh it was more than that, zoe quinn did some shit.
[19:46:09] <imode> the rest of it was just "I hate women" though.
[19:46:36] <companion_cube> what did she do?
[19:47:00] <drakonis> oh god not again
[19:48:02] <kline> yeah
[19:48:11] <kline> gamergate is a shitshow and no side comes out clean
[19:48:21] <imode> as I understand it from a 100-meter view, because at the time it was like watching a neckbeard-vs.-tumblr civil war take place, she used sexual favors to get into the public eye.
[19:48:36] <drakonis> she most certainly did not use sexual favors though
[19:48:40] <kline> almost everyone involved is up to their neck in bad behaviour
[19:48:51] <ngoldbaum> lmao imode jesus christ
[19:49:03] <ngoldbaum> she dated a journalist come the fuck on
[19:49:11] <manicennui> It doesn't even matter. Nothing she did or didn't do justifies the threats and other bullshit.
[19:49:22] <imode> why are you talking as if I advocated for those.
[19:49:34] <companion_cube> cause this is probably false
[19:49:42] <companion_cube> the kind of cheap smear the idiots used
[19:49:43] <ngoldbaum> you literally said “she used sexual favors to get into the public eye”
[19:49:43] <drakonis> in the grand scheme of things, the alt right had the most bad behavior
[19:49:50] <ngoldbaum> which is just like not even close to reality
[19:49:52] <drakonis> by far and wide
[19:49:58] <wrl> ethics in gaming journalism ethics in gaming journalism ethic
[19:50:11] <manicennui> "journalism"
[19:50:13] <drakonis> the ethics thing is such a smokescreen lol
[19:50:24] <Brekkjern> It's not like gaming "journalism" has become more ethical after that point. Rather the opposite really.
[19:50:40] <Brekkjern> Gamergate being irrelevant to that take tbh
[19:50:53] <drakonis> indigo: stanislav dunking norvig hard
[19:51:01] <imode> quite the opposite. also ngoldbaum, I did clarify that it was from a "100-meter view". the last time I knew anything gamergate related was roughly the time it stopped being a thing.
[19:51:08] <manicennui> The main point is still that nothing justifies their behavior.
[19:51:26] <manicennui> They want everyone to debate this bullshit.
[19:51:26] <companion_cube> for me it's on par with "but her emails", bullshit-wise
[19:51:29] <imode> if that sexual favors thing is false, so be it.
[19:51:30] <manicennui> Rather than what they did.
[19:51:45] <ngoldbaum> from a 100-meter view you’re wrong but keep on spreading false narratives from 4chan or whatever
[19:52:01] <imode> dial the outrage down a bit. yeah, apparently I'm wrong.
[19:52:11] <companion_cube> the difference is that imode can change :p

[19:52:36] <drakonis> its very good and accurate.
[19:52:45] <drakonis> its wild how fucked up the whole thing ended being
[19:53:04] <imode> it was 7 years ago and I stopped paying attention to it after 2015.
[19:53:09] <drakonis> its good you did
[19:53:18] <drakonis> but its time for a refresher because its about to make the rounds again
[19:53:22] <imode> jfc.
[19:53:53] <gwozniak> All I remember of Gamergate is that there was some pretty shitty behaviour on display
[19:54:14] <imode> apparently it started from a fucking blog post? this reads like a scott pilgrim fanfic.
[19:54:36] <ngoldbaum> i mean you should probably stop making incorrect statements about it then that make you sound like an 8chan user
[19:54:55] <drakonis> it started from a 9000 word screed that's basically bullshit
[19:55:05] <imode> did "I was wrong" not satisfy your blood lust. calm the fuck down.
[19:55:24] <drakonis> it got paraded in multiple websites to find an army to attack zoe quinn lol
[19:55:26] <drakonis> its insane
[19:55:44] <imode> is Eron Gjoni just a pen name for elon musk.
[19:55:47] <imode> is he at the center of this.
[19:55:56] <drakonis> he is at the center, yes.
[19:56:03] <drakonis> not elon musk, no.
[19:56:37] <imode> damn.
[19:56:44] <drakonis> the whole thing is appalling
[19:56:56] <companion_cube> a nice prelude to Q and MAGA
[19:56:58] <companion_cube> that's what that was
[19:57:06] <imode> yeah I'm starting to see the parallels..
[19:57:21] <companion_cube> literally the same people that peddled peppe memes online
[19:57:25] <companion_cube> in 2016
[19:57:44] <drakonis> you'd be interested to find out that steve bannon was part of this shit
[19:57:44] <imode> so I came in around.. november 2014.
[19:58:03] <imode> and promptly exited.
[19:58:12] <drakonis> the alt right was spawned off gamergate
[19:58:20] <drakonis> cant believe america fell because of gamergate
[19:58:41] <companion_cube> i'd say that the very online component of the alt-right did
[19:58:47] <imode> `Milo Yiannopoulos` oh yeah this shitheel.
[19:58:49] <companion_cube> but there's also a lot of people who are not that tech asvy
[19:58:52] <companion_cube> savvy* ?
[19:59:13] <drakonis> yes.
[19:59:34] <imode> encyclopedia dramatica is still a thing?
[20:00:04] <drakonis> yeah
[20:00:26] <imode> https://archive.is/MeIYt there's no way we're not living in a holodeck program if this post started the downfall of america.
[20:00:27] <buttsbot> Just a moment...
[20:00:47] <imode> computer, terminate program.
[20:00:55] <drakonis> yes.
[20:01:00] <drakonis> yes that's the post
[20:02:08] <imode> "The Cum Collage May Not Be Entirely Accurate'
[20:02:13] <imode> dude I have to work today
[20:02:55] <imode> all of this is familiar and yet unfamiliar at the same time, _wow_ I was off mark.
[20:03:07] <companion_cube> yeah, it's just the same sad shit
[20:03:08] <drakonis> 4chan has a way with distorting reality
[20:04:40] <ngoldbaum> imode: maybe you can see why i reacted so strongly, you were more or less saying “but you know, that Q guy made some good points in a few of his drops”
[20:05:08] <imode> ngoldbaum: yeah, but have some faith that I'm not an overtly paid shill.
[20:05:15] <companion_cube> no worries, we do
[20:05:19] <manicennui> There is a similar movement in comic books who is mad about there being more female and gay characters.
[20:05:28] <manicennui> These people only focus on the most important stuff.
[20:05:32] <imode> you've known me for the minimum amount of time to be confident in that belief.
[20:05:48] <manicennui> I don't think the concern is that you are being paid.
[20:05:54] <companion_cube> manicennui: it's the utter lack of imagination
[20:06:09] <companion_cube> unable to project oneself into a even slightly character/hero
[20:06:14] <imode> totalbiscuit hopped on pretty early on.
[20:06:16] <companion_cube> "I can't identify with the hero if it's a girl!"
[20:06:34] <riv> there's nothing wrong with that
[20:06:42] <manicennui> I've never understood identifying with comic book characters.
[20:06:49] <riv> if you want to read a story with the main character the same gender as you
[20:07:00] <edk> i dunno it's a bit silly imo
[20:07:01] <companion_cube> riv: it kind of sucks
[20:07:20] <companion_cube> it's lazyness and latent racism/sexism/transphobia/…
[20:07:21] <edk> i can't identify with heros if they're cool and strong and good
[20:07:23] <imode> riv: yeah so read a different story.
[20:07:30] <riv> I will
[20:07:41] <companion_cube> like if you play Celeste and can't identify with the (female) hero, you just kind of suck
[20:07:47] <riv> Celeste is trans
[20:07:52] <companion_cube> yep, also.
[20:08:03] <ngoldbaum> i don’t think you’re a paid shill, just too credulous
[20:08:15] <imode> well, forget identifying with characters, you have the option of, I don't know, doing something else.
[20:08:29] <riv> but what if you're a transman and just don't want to play a game as a female character today?
[20:08:33] <companion_cube> "but I can't read batman now that we know Robin is gay!"
[20:08:49] <edk> riv: then don't play one
[20:08:50] <companion_cube> riv: then there are other games, I guess?
[20:09:03] <edk> but that seems like a problem of trends, not individual games
[20:09:20] <riv> so hopefully that made it clear why it's too blanket a statement
[20:09:21] <imode> ngoldbaum: here's a time capsule for you. these events were 7 years ago. the only thing I've heard since is echoes of them and "there's shit on both sides". the thing that stuck was the original accusation about ethics, and there was so much noise (and still is) that nobody published a refutation that reached any major place I read.
[20:09:40] <riv> these were rhetorical questions btw
[20:09:53] <edk> i could never understand what the point of gamergate even was
[20:10:11] <imode> so don't call me gullible.
[20:10:13] <ngoldbaum> ok, well just be aware that you sounded like an 8chan troll earlier
[20:10:14] <riv> it's to preserve the integrity of video game journalism edk
[20:10:19] <edk> yeah but i mean specifically
[20:10:38] <edk> was it all about that person who might or might not have slept with another person who might or might not have been in a position to review their games
[20:10:43] <imode> you'd think I'd be around long enough for benefit of doubt privileges.
[20:10:49] <ngoldbaum> “i don’t question what i read and repeat it credulously 8 years later, don’t call me gullible though”
[20:11:19] <imode> you can work on outdated information about a chaotic situation that fades out of the public eye and not be gullible.
[20:11:25] <riv> I think the whole idea of gamergate is just to get people really charged up and angry at each other
[20:11:31] <edk> yeah, well
[20:11:36] <imode> it's almost like I didn't stalk the information hubs for this thing.
[20:11:43] <edk> i guess it worked
[20:12:18] <imode> edk: some dude got broken up with and spread an angry zuckerberg style break-up post to multiple forums which incited people that had a problem with people with colored hair and women.
[20:12:23] <edk> why are there so many ur-hellthreads today
[20:12:34] <drakonis> its hellthread day
[20:12:57] <imode> this spiralled into a catalytic reaction that was a rallying cry for neckbeards to organize and harass people.
[20:13:33] <edk> i don't understand what the gamers were angry about specifically i guess
[20:13:46] <companion_cube> women
[20:14:04] <edk> like what reason were they telling themselves they were harassing people for?
[20:14:17] <companion_cube> (well. they were mad that some people criticized video games for being sexist or lacking female representation)
[20:14:17] <imode> well, as I was incorrectly stating earlier, the accusation was that a particular person slept with a game journalist to gain media coverage, and everything spiralled out from that.
[20:14:33] <edk> i can definitely believe that there are that many misogynists in the world, but i think they'd need an excuse
[20:15:20] <manicennui> edk: An excuse?
[20:15:36] <manicennui> A good chunk of the population still thinks women should be property.
[20:15:38] <imode> the excuse was "women are using their bodies as a tool to corrupt the beautiful ivory tower that is games journalism to promote tumblr games".
[20:16:07] <edk> manicennui: i think the number of people who really do consciously think that is probably relatively small
[20:16:10] <edk> imode: *nod*
[20:16:38] <manicennui> edk: I think that it is unfortunately larger than we'd think.
[20:16:54] <imode> and everything just blew out from there as you took pieces of that statement and chose what to be angry about, fueled by.. apparently very decently organized harassment and doxing campaigns.
[20:17:18] <imode> I'm gonna stop looking at this list.
[20:17:51] <edk> manicennui: they do exist, but i think there are a lot more people who do harbour misogynistic prejudices, but need to be energized about some sort of perceived threat in order to start attacking women because of them
[20:18:15] <edk> and yes, maybe it's wishful thinking on my part to think the former chunk of the population is small
[20:19:35] <ngoldbaum> “first they make games with female protagonists, soon they’ll make call of duty have a lesbian squad”
[20:20:08] <imode> someone tell them that ancient greeks were gay.
[20:20:16] <ngoldbaum> taco trucks on every corner
[20:20:50] <imode> what the fuck, richard dawkins was in on this?!

[20:23:14] <imode> companion_cube: just Ctrl+F on the gamergate timeline, what the fuck am I reading.
[20:23:33] <imode> "March 22: For some inexplicable reason, Richard Dawkins is drawn into Gamergate because he discovers his listing on "The Block Bot" (different from Randi Harper's Good Game Auto Blocker) through Breitbart and the participation of many Gators to tell him Gamergate is about "ethics in video game journalism". Mark Kern reaches out to him. Dawkins demands a follower apologizes to Carl "Sargon of
[20:23:35] <imode> Akkad" Benjamin. Dawkins ultimately decides to remain "ignorant" of what Gamergate really is, but remains indignant over alleged libel."
[20:23:45] <imode> alright y'all can't criticise me for operating on the wrong information anymore.
[20:24:05] <companion_cube> oh no
[20:24:20] <drakonis> January 27: Richard Dawkins: "I'm a feminist, but this Sargon of Akkad fellow has made an interesting youtube video about how Feminism and Islamism are the same thing". Facepalm omnes. He's now deleted the tweet.

[20:24:58] <drakonis> it gets worse...
[20:25:12] <imode> how does it not get worse.
[20:25:23] <drakonis> it never does
[20:25:25] <drakonis> it only gets worse
[20:25:38] <drakonis> it never stops getting worse
[20:25:42] <imode> "Gamergate is angry at image hosting company Imgur, accusing it of censorship of a picture which is allegedly showing counter-protestors at a Donald Trump rally."
[20:25:58] <imode> that was in march 2016.
[20:26:05] <imode> and so it began.
[20:26:59] <manicennui> They are just angry, period.
[20:27:07] <manicennui> Looking for scapegoats for their problems.
[20:27:21] <manicennui> It's a key principle of right-wing politics.
[20:28:16] <imode> tragic that totalbiscuit practically ended his life on a gamergate note.
[20:29:40] <drakonis> you should see when totalbiscuit sicced his followers on game devs for not having 60 fps on their games
[20:30:14] <imode> I think I'm just going to go back to programming now.
[20:30:23] <drakonis> that's fair
[20:30:31] <imode> that was too much bullshit in one sitting.
[20:30:37] <drakonis> this isnt worth spending any more time on because its a trash fire

[21:13:14] <riv> hmm
[21:13:25] <riv> is it possible to see the 'bad code' he replaced his lib with?
[21:13:38] <riv> was it like... console.log("blah blah" somemanifesto?
[21:14:24] <companion_cube> so why was he banned from github exactly?
[21:14:30] <ngoldbaum> gerikson: i imagine this was a point in the negotiations between the US and russia today
[21:14:57] <gerikson> LOL
[21:15:07] <ngoldbaum> companion_cube: for explicitly maliciously introducing a bug in his library, pushing it to github, publishing it to npm

[21:19:10] <ngoldbaum> maybe with baking stuff
[21:19:32] <riv> it's so nice
[21:23:04] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: now I'm curious about what the github ToS are :)
[21:23:14] <companion_cube> like, adding a bug to your code is a banishable offense?
[21:23:29] <ngoldbaum> accidentally? no
[21:23:37] <companion_cube> I'm not trying to excuse the guy, I'm curious about that part. Banned from npm is more understandable
[21:23:43] <riv> the guys had a complete mental breakdown and been taken to hospital by police
[21:23:46] <ngoldbaum> on purpose with the express intent of doing a supply chain attack? yeah
[21:23:51] <riv> and is under an FBI and anti-terrorism investigation
[21:24:01] <riv> so i think its a bit of a different situation than "just added a bug"
[21:30:29] <riv> oh
[21:30:31] <riv> important detail
[21:30:35] <riv> the bomb thing was September 17, 2020

[22:00:44] <riv> I tried going to the gym a lot for 2 months but it didn't help cause i kept overeating, and now I'm really not keen to go somewhere like that with lots of people
[22:01:18] <manicennui> Might not have caused you to lose weight, but your physical condition is probably still better.
[22:01:24] <ngoldbaum> have you tried couch to 5k?
[22:01:33] * manicennui focuses on the couch part.
[22:01:38] <riv> im not sure manicennui, I overdid it near the end and had a headache for a week
[22:01:42] <riv> although probably overall yeah
[22:01:52] <riv> I haven't tried that, I'm not very keen on running
[22:02:01] <riv> if I did run a lot I'm sure I would get fit ....
[22:02:29] <ngoldbaum> running gets easier the more you do it
[22:02:46] <ngoldbaum> low equipment, you do it outside
[22:02:48] <riv> I kind of developed a very mild eating disorder recently, just stress, bordom whatever => eat
[22:03:18] <companion_cube> a possibility is to try and have healthier snacks
[22:03:20] <manicennui> That's basically how I've been for a few decades.
[22:03:21] <riv> ill do a run tommorow for sure
[22:03:22] <companion_cube> if you can't not snack
[22:03:43] <riv> yes good call on healthier snakc
[22:03:57] <ngoldbaum> don’t get discouraged if it’s hard at first, run as much as you can and walk when you get out of breath
[22:04:05] <epilys> look up HIIT
[22:04:07] <riv> ty
[22:04:12] <ngoldbaum> eventually you’ll run longer and longer without stopping
[22:04:18] <companion_cube> I like apples, personally
[22:04:20] <riv> oh yes i've heard of HIIT - but isn't that really hard and exausting?
[22:04:24] <companion_cube> it's filling enough
[22:04:36] <ngoldbaum> HIIT can be yeah, but loke
[22:04:45] <manicennui> Ultimately, you aren't going to do enough exercise to lose weight.
[22:04:47] <ngoldbaum> like running if you do it more it gets easier
[22:04:48] <epilys> riv, only if you overexert yourself, I found it made running less boring for me
[22:05:01] <bontaq> HIIT is hard but the benefit is it's short, like 15-20 mins can have good health results
[22:05:08] <ngoldbaum> bodyweight strength exercises also don’t need much equipment
[22:05:08] <epilys> yeah weight is mainly from diet not exercise
[22:05:11] <riv> manicennui: yeah I understand that I need to win on both counts
[22:05:47] <riv> maybe in another 2 months ill have made at least a little progress. hopefully
[22:05:48] <manicennui> I'd just find some kind of physical activity that you enjoy or at least tolerate well and can stick with.
[22:05:52] <ngoldbaum> have you done calorie tracking?
[22:06:05] <riv> I did that a few years ago and lost weight, but I've put it back on this year
[22:06:05] <ngoldbaum> it helped me get a taste for food that’s less calorie dense
[22:06:32] <wrl> riv: where do you usually get your food? take-out, cooking at home, what?
[22:06:37] <riv> it's a lot of effort to weigh and put stuff in, but it's probably really smart to do it
[22:07:00] <riv> i basically never go out to eat, so everything is supermarket stuff in my house
[22:07:04] <wrl> got it
[22:07:13] <wrl> how do you measure what you eat, if you measure at all?
[22:07:19] <riv> no i don't measure anything
[22:07:22] <wrl> mm
[22:07:23] <wrl> ok so
[22:07:28] <manicennui> If it helps, as you become older and your hormones drop, it becomes *so* much more difficult.
[22:07:33] <manicennui> So better do it now!
[22:07:39] <wrl> the first thing you should do is stop buying junk food
[22:07:46] <wrl> if you don't have it around, you don't eat it idly
[22:07:46] <riv> yeah better do it now or ill not get older
[22:07:56] <wrl> by all means, buy *better* snack food
[22:07:57] <riv> yeah. I keep buying these cookies
[22:08:05] <manicennui> What kind of cookies?
[22:08:10] <wrl> i know it's tempting but you gotta just not buy them
[22:08:12] <riv> and I eat 1 and then I know another one will make me feel awful, but I wait 20 mins and eat it anyway
[22:08:22] <bontaq> yeah, for me at least the most successful diets have been figuring out a meal I like and the calories, then pretty much just eating that every day and eventually adding things back in
[22:08:27] <wrl> ^ yep
[22:08:41] <ngoldbaum> also like if the overeating is a mental health thing addressing the inderlying depression, ocd, or anxiety is also important
[22:08:42] <riv> https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/cookies/sainsburys-milk-chocolate-cookies-x5-6544324-p these
[22:08:45] <wrl> when i measure what i eat, i generally just measure one or two components of the dish by weight
[22:08:46] <riv> i dont even like them lol
[22:08:54] <wrl> so like if i'm making a meat dish i'll just weigh the meat that i put in
[22:09:00] <wrl> and then i scale the recipe up or down around that
[22:09:19] <riv> yeah i'm not sure what's wrong with me in terms of mental health. I;m doing really well relatively - I got out of a really bad abusive relationship and I've been so much happier
[22:09:21] <manicennui> That bag looks like one serving to me.
[22:09:26] <ngoldbaum> it’s ok for the calorie counts to just be ballpark accurate
[22:09:27] <riv> manicennui: haha
[22:09:30] <riv> tell me about it
[22:09:40] <ngoldbaum> the main thing is recognizing which foods are very calorie dense
[22:09:49] <riv> the covid situation sucks a lot, that's probably the main negative thing going on
[22:10:04] <manicennui> You an extrovert?
[22:10:15] <manicennui> This shit is great for me.
[22:10:30] <riv> I'm an introvert but not *this* much
[22:10:53] <manicennui> I do have a friend that I video chat once in a while.
[22:11:03] <imode> go watch smiling friends.
[22:11:15] <manicennui> And I socialize at work.
[22:11:20] <bontaq> or if I'm sucking at the diet, I'll go keto for awhile to reacquaint myself with saying no to basically everything ':D

[22:46:15] <Xe> Church: it's the best PCVR headset i've used, it ain't perfect but it's certainly better than it has any reason to be
[22:46:42] <Church> Yeah wondering where I can sell my old Oculus CV1 now I bought on a lark.
[22:47:02] <Xe> the index needs a beefy GPU though
[22:47:07] <Church> Of course I need to also actually build a tower and stop frying my gaming laptop
[22:47:09] <Xe> gaming laptops will not cut it
[22:47:12] <Church> Eyep
[22:47:30] <Church> Maybe 2023 heh given house saving and car buying.
[22:47:37] <Church> Maybe if I get a nice raise this year
[22:47:48] <Xe> tbh
[22:47:52] <Xe> get a quest 2
[22:48:04] <manicennui> Plus you need a cool tractor.
[22:48:07] <Xe> > facebook
[22:48:08] <manicennui> They aren't cheap.
[22:48:08] <Xe> but it's one of the best VR experiences money can buy
[22:48:21] <drakonis> what the fuck is with all these lisp posts right now
[22:48:27] <manicennui> Right now?
[22:48:27] <drakonis> did something happen?
[22:48:32] <ngoldbaum> the psvr2 looks nice
[22:48:47] <Church> It's detached from FB now I thought ya? Remember them pulling back on the FB login shit ya
[22:48:55] <Xe> the PSVR2 looks really nice, i'll get one when i can
[22:48:56] <ngoldbaum> i have a valve index and it kinda sucks tbh
[22:48:59] <Church> And how well does it work on Linux with stuff anyway?
[22:49:02] <Xe> still can't get a fucking PS5
[22:49:06] <Church> Heh
[22:49:06] <ngoldbaum> alyx was good
[22:49:24] <Xe> Church: it works great on windows, linux depends on the distro and how much you pissed off mesa
[22:49:33] <Church> Heh so index it is then
[22:49:50] <Church> I'd like to not have to return a couple hundred dollar device due to compat issues
[22:50:11] <Xe> honestly though
[22:50:16] <Xe> i run it mostly in windows
[22:51:33] <bontaq> are there any good linux VR desktops?  I wanted to try out programming in VR to see 1000 foot tall emacs
[22:52:10] <Xe> there are not yet, i've got my hopes on simulavr though
[22:52:57] <drakonis> doesnt arcan have one?
[22:53:12] <manicennui> drakonis: I think you are just noticing the lisp submissions because you are interested in it right now.
[22:53:24] <drakonis> that might be it
[22:53:31] <manicennui> drakonis: Lisp is always way overrepresented on HN/lobsters.

[22:55:07] <Church> Xe: Heh good to know. I basically just want it for chat/vtube shite and a VR WM/desktop experience for the most part.
[22:55:18] <Church> So I should be able to fiddle it into place eventually
[22:56:43] <bontaq> Xe: yeah hopefully simulavr pans out, I tried running it but failed.  Maybe after work today I'll give it another shot
[22:59:17] <indigo> manicennui: The comment responding to Norvig is... interesting
[22:59:28] <indigo> Apparently you are a Nazi if you work at Google

[23:19:13] <manicennui> Claiming that because one knows C it is somehow possible to understand a wide range of things written in C is kind of disingenuous.
[23:20:07] <prussian> some languages changed their hashmap datastructures to using siphash since it's supposed to be pretty tough against people trying to abuse it.
[23:20:13] <manicennui> I think there are only a handful of languages/frameworks/libraries where you will likely not have much problem understanding an unfamiliar piece of software easily.
[23:20:40] <manicennui> And C ain't one of them.
[23:20:44] <prussian> this post is baity as fuck
[23:20:47] <prussian> lmao
[23:21:10] <prussian> A COMMON LANGUAGE could be basically whatever you want it to be.
[23:21:58] <prussian> I don't get it, is this guy claiming lisp is the devil because of "DSLs?"
[23:22:27] <manicennui> Basically.
[23:22:42] <prussian> you read the DSLs like anything else. I really don't get the rant.
[23:22:52] <prussian> meh
[23:22:59] <drakonis> macros are the devil
[23:23:01] <manicennui> There might be some truth to that (making it more difficult to pick up different code bases, not being the devil), but C is a terrible counterexample.
[23:23:10] <drakonis> something something redefine operators
[23:23:29] <prussian> cpp can be abused to make some funny c
[23:23:40] <prussian> thankfully clangd can do macro expansion at point
[23:23:46] <companion_cube> the only common language is postscript
[23:23:51] <prussian> so true.
[23:23:54] <companion_cube> works on desktops, works on printers, unmodified.
[23:23:56] <prussian> in the fucked up ironic sense
[23:23:56] <companion_cube> beat that, C
[23:23:57] <manicennui> C++ is one of the worst languages for "I know this language so I can understand this code base".
[23:24:30] <prussian> companion_cube: someone didn't believe me that postscript/pdf was like an actual programming language until they opened up some crap one I wrote that just drew a rectangle. lol
[23:24:37] <companion_cube> :D
[23:24:37] <riv> imode: djbhash is good for that
[23:24:56] <manicennui> I also think this is central to the problem: "Most modern Software spanning 100k's lines of code"
[23:25:19] <prussian> ultimately, if you really "know the language" any semblance of abuse and weirdness or DSLness has to conform to some semblance of shared rules.
[23:25:25] <prussian> I'm not really sure it's a big deal.
[23:25:33] <prussian> or *as* big a deal as people make it.
[23:25:34] <companion_cube> realistically, you can't do that much in small programs
[23:25:51] <prussian> ya
[23:25:54] <companion_cube> doesn't have to be hundreds of klocs, but still
[23:26:28] <prussian> I just don't use lisp because I feel like I'm typing a literal AST all the time and it makes me weary.
[23:26:31] <imode> I have like, three things I need to generate a unique identifier from, two strings and a map.
[23:26:35] <prussian> that's basically it.
[23:26:36] <prussian> lol
[23:26:41] <prussian> and I use emacs.
[23:28:15] <manicennui> prussian: Seems like macros could help there, and using a lisp that gave up on trying to represent everything with cons cells.
[23:29:32] <manicennui> The threading macro and the data structures in Clojure make things much nicer.
[23:29:42] <drakonis> you can certainly get these with libraries though
[23:29:42] <manicennui> macros
[23:30:01] <prussian> well I was looking at some AoC solutions using racket
[23:30:05] <prussian> looked pretty neat.
[23:30:11] <manicennui> Yeah, Racket is decent.
[23:31:06] <drakonis> just not too excited about racket's dev team
[23:31:19] <drakonis> the hubris is real
[23:31:33] <imode> ahahahahaha.
[23:31:37] <manicennui> They are academics because it is really an academic project.
[23:31:39] <imode> moxie is no longer CEO of signal.
[23:31:42] <prussian>  if I cared about such things, i'd probably just go full schizo and live innawoods
[23:31:44] <drakonis> moxie?
[23:31:56] <prussian> not that i'm supporting any kind of bad behavior of course...
[23:32:02] <imode> the wonderful author of that giant shitpost on the front page.
[23:32:04] <manicennui> prussian: Living in the woods sounds nice.
[23:32:08] <imode> "My first impressions of web3"
[23:32:11] <prussian> I guess.
[23:32:24] <prussian> I watched some of those alaska shows and it looks like a lot of work
[23:32:25] <drakonis> lol
[23:32:33] <prussian> and I'm not sure I like the taste of caribou
[23:32:36] <manicennui> prussian: It can be.
[23:32:37] <prussian> or salmon
[23:32:40] <epilys> I didn't even know moxie was CEO. Doesn't that mean they had to reveal their legal name?
[23:32:41] <manicennui> prussian: I think that is actually a good thing.
[23:32:42] <drakonis> worst thing about racket: "the toplevel is hopeless"
[23:32:56] <manicennui> Although I don't think going to the extremes that some of them do is necessary.
[23:33:33] <prussian> I mean, unless you're in some big town, I imagine you're kinda on your own
[23:33:38] <prussian> wouldn't know though
[23:33:42] <prussian> never been to alaska.
[23:33:59] <manicennui> prussian: Sure, but Alaska is pretty extreme.
[23:34:06] <manicennui> One can live in the woods elsewhere and not be so isolated.
[23:34:25] <manicennui> The US has tons of forested land available.
[23:35:23] <prussian> I guess.
[23:35:34] <prussian> imagine it's not as frontiersy though
[23:36:00] <drakonis> racket the lang is very good though
[23:37:28] <prussian> I'll fuck around with it.
[23:37:29] <manicennui> prussian: Montana and Wyoming can be.
[23:37:53] <manicennui> prussian: And at some point, it doesn't really matter if you have enough land that you can't see civilization.
[23:37:56] <prussian> maybe if I spend enough time scheming I'll see the light of the Guix way over NixOS
[23:38:07] <prussian> manicennui: ya but that's the joke.
[23:38:09] <manicennui> You can find lots that are dozens of acres in most states that are really wild.
[23:38:12] <prussian> is to go something something
[23:39:04] <manicennui> Ted Kaczynski was near Lincoln, Montana.
[23:39:28] <manicennui> He used a bicycle to get into town, so he wasn't that isolated.
[23:42:44] <prussian> what a sell-out.
[23:47:07] <prussian> maybe I should just like, make my own language with an LLVM frontend
[23:47:16] <prussian> llvm as the backend*
[23:47:54] <epilys> the kaleidoscope llvm tutorial is pretty good
[23:48:08] <prussian> good to know. thanks
[23:48:23] <prussian> I guess it's time to do it.
[23:48:58] <prussian> I will make my own haskell, without partial functions and cross-compiling out of the gate and it will have black jack and hookers. what can go wrong?
[23:51:50] <companion_cube> main difficulty with llvm is the GC, if I understand correctly
[23:52:24] <epilys> and the STG
[23:52:29] <epilys> re: haskell
[23:52:47] <epilys> https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/1992/04/spineless-tagless-gmachine.pdf
[23:55:21] <prussian> the future.
[23:57:16] <companion_cube> not sure the STG is actually still used
