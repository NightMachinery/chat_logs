[05:13:17] <mdhughes> Why would you need flexvector if you can't mutate it anyway? The whole point of flex is that you're adding & modifying stuff!
[05:14:26] <Zipheir> Would you prefer set-car! over cons, then?
[05:15:01] <mdhughes> Well, we do need both, otherwise you can't build structures.
[05:15:46] <Zipheir> You can *always* update a data structure immutably; it's just that some structures are optimized for it.
[05:15:46] <mdhughes> Or you can just copy with one minor change over and over, which is great for gc when you've got a few gig data set.
[05:16:26] <Zipheir> C'mon, you know that a huge amount of work on immutable structures is to reuse as much as possible.
[05:17:26] <Zipheir> Maybe cons returns a new list, but I can more or less assume that the entire list hasn't been copied.  It's the same for any good immutable structure.
[05:18:03] <mdhughes> I do, but it's often not possible. A simple hashtable, you can reuse the key-value-hash tries, but the entire spine has to be regenerated on every write if it's immutable.
[05:18:38] <mdhughes> RB trees are worse, the entire thing may be rebalanced by a write.
[05:19:40] <mdhughes> Meanwhile, a growable vector only has to realloc when you go past the end of the buffer.
[05:22:36] *** Quits: qhong (~qhong@rescomp-21-400677.stanford.edu) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[05:23:01] <Zipheir> Well, this is why immutable hashtables are rather rare.  Hash-mapped trees are better suited to "pure" update.
[05:23:25] <Zipheir> And the situation with pure-update R-B trees is not so bad; rebalancing is generally fast.
[05:24:50] <Zipheir> Okasaki's implementation of R-B trees guarantees O(log n) for all operations, whether or not rebalancing is involved.
[05:25:28] <Zipheir> (_Pure Functional Data Structures_, Cambridge 1998)
[05:28:00] <Zipheir> All of which is not to say there aren't some serious challenges for immutable data.
[05:29:06] *** Quits: badkins (~badkins@136.56.92.199) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[05:32:35] <Zipheir> I think a lot of people get the kind of CS education that says "For job X, use hash tables.  For job Y, use arrays. ..."; as such, there's some cargo cult thinking about what structures work for what.
[05:33:49] <mdhughes> I do need to see if I can get SRFI 214 into Chez, it's not in thunderchez. Or just adapt my mutable stringbuffer into a vector equivalent.
[05:34:13] <Zipheir> Looking at it more abstractly, in terms of what operations you want and what complexity you expect, there's a lot more out there.  Hash-tables, e.g., are *one* way to implement an abstract dictionary type.
[05:34:37] <mdhughes> But we do generally want linear-search/update, which is hard or slow in a lot of alternative structures.

[06:46:23] <Zipheir> Did anyone ever do a finger tree sequence implementation for Scheme?
[06:51:45] <edgar-rft> I don't finger trees, at least not in public
[06:52:11] <s-liao> Yes. What is " a finger tree sequence"?
[06:52:42] <edgar-rft> if you finger a tree several times in a row
[06:53:39] <Zipheir> It's like a list, but with O(1) head, O(1) last, O(log n) append, and O(1) length.
[06:53:39] <s-liao> http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/FingerTree.pdf
[06:53:53] <Zipheir> For many purposes they're strictly better than lists.

[17:47:00] <leah2> is there a lispy language that doesn't use exceptions/conditions but something like Either/Result instead?
[17:50:37] <sham1> Carp, mayhaps
[17:51:25] <sham1> Although you can make like Go and return multiple values where the first one is "did the operation succeed"
[17:51:51] <sham1> Not sure if that's a thing one can do in Carp necessarily but it can be done in both CL and Scheme
[17:54:43] <jcowan> Carp is only Lispy in its syntax.
[17:55:17] <sham1> That's true, although it wasn't specified just how lispy is lispy enough
[17:56:14] <jcowan> it reminds me of Tinylisp, which was Fortran with Lisp syntax and was usad as the input to a parallalizer.  Using Tinylisp meant not having to write a Fortran parser.
[17:56:41] <leah2> Carp, i forgot about that. thanks
[17:56:55] <leah2> i just think if you had some do-style macro programming with Result would also be quite nice
[17:57:12] <sham1> (-> …)
[17:58:29] <sham1> Although I don't really see how much benefit there is for having monadic code in a Lisp. Carp at least would have the excuse of being essentially a batch language but with s-expressions
[18:00:22] <leah2> i wonder if Result is less popular in dynamically typed languages because it's easier to get wrong
[18:05:52] <wasamasa> why would you deal with results in a first place?
[18:06:10] <wasamasa> it's not like a dynamically typed language is subjected to a type system encouraging such stunts
[18:06:29] <wasamasa> there needs to be a compelling advantage to use them
[18:06:40] <wasamasa> such as having a monadic parser combinator as a result
[18:09:06] *** Quits: shawnw (~shawn_w@c-73-225-121-73.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[18:16:01] <aeth> why did you assume dynamically typed? there's Typed Racket, some estoeric (ab)uses of Common Lisp, and a bunch of mini-languages on top of other Lisps, especially CL (e.g. Coalton and Shen)
[18:16:07] <aeth> just off of the top of my head
[18:17:15] <leah2> wasamasa: in practice, may things fail or succeed
[18:17:44] <leah2> and instead of throwing an exception on failure, it may be nicer to just work with values
[18:17:58] *** Joins: badkins (~badkins@136.56.92.199)
[18:19:14] <wasamasa> I mean, the idea of exceptions is that they're exceptional
[18:19:31] <wasamasa> instead of handling everything that may raise an error individually, you handle the error in one place
[18:19:38] <wasamasa> convenient stuff, until it isn't
[18:21:09] <leah2> in practice people just forget to do it and paper over it at the end :p
[18:21:22] <wasamasa> even lazier, yes
[18:22:10] <wasamasa> so, a compelling advantage why you'd instead want to check every failing case with monadic syntax, hm
[18:22:22] <wasamasa> it might be slightly less painful than C-style error handling :D
[18:23:22] <leah2> i mean many of these new low-level languages have a result type, either explicitly or built-in. say rust, zig, etc
[18:23:42] <leah2> and lisps certainly can do the syntactic sugar to make them convenient to use
[18:23:58] <sjamaan> Presumably those languages do it because you can't just unwind the stack like with an exception
[18:24:14] <sjamaan> You might need to do resource deallocation before passing on the error
[18:24:27] <wasamasa> yeah, C's way to handle a finally-like construct is terrible
[18:24:33] <wasamasa> a goto
[18:24:34] <sjamaan> I don't really see why a GC'ed language would need it
[18:24:55] <leah2> many ocaml libs also move to it
[18:25:02] <jcowan> But SRFI 189 is very new and I don't think most Lispars are convinced of its merits, which is why there's a whole section concerned with translating between Mayba/Either and other protocols.
[18:25:49] <wasamasa> the only reason I can come up with, other than being subjected to a statically typed language, is to prove that all exceptional situations and errors are handled
[18:26:02] <wasamasa> this might be useful if you compile your lisp to a language where failure is not an option
[18:26:18] <sjamaan> Java does that in a different way IIRC
[18:26:25] <sjamaan> There's a way to indicate what exceptions are thrown
[18:26:28] <wasamasa> right, java has checked exceptions and people absolutely hate them
[18:26:31] <leah2> well java had checked exceptions but they kind of got rid of them
[18:26:34] <sjamaan> Exactly
[18:27:02] <wasamasa> ada has varying degrees of proving that you're not shooting yourself in the foot
[18:27:03] <sjamaan> They're a total pain because you have to explicitly add new exception types even if you don't care in middleware, for example
[18:27:26] <wasamasa> there are special DSLs/dialects for increasingly difficult tasks, such as writing cryptography code
[18:27:42] <wasamasa> imagine a language that allowed you to prove your code executes in constant time
[18:27:47] <wasamasa> or doesn't allocate memory
[18:28:02] <gwatt> sjamaan: or you get lazy and make everything extend RuntimeException which doesn't require "throws ___" in the method prototype
[18:28:10] <wasamasa> or only uses a specified amount of memory
[18:28:17] <wasamasa> uclisp :P
[18:29:13] <wasamasa> or other time guarantees, like if you're writing algo trading code for some financial exchange
[18:29:33] <wasamasa> or bounded loops when executing your code in the kernel
[18:30:02] <wasamasa> or something that's not quite turing complete for security reasons

[21:12:21] <sham1> Halt and Catch Fire
[21:13:54] <mdhughes> Scheme/LISPs have too many intermediate steps to make manual error handling practical. In ObjC, you have to check RC and maybe log **error after most operations, because exceptions are always (in an application, not system services) fatal.
[21:13:59] <aeth> technically speaking, everything fails eventually.
[21:15:29] <mdhughes> But if you nested up a bunch of functions and somewhere down inside it errors, you have to pass it all the way up. Scheme doesn't even *have* call-by-address to make that plausible. Have to use a box? Ick.

[23:52:12] <Zipheir> sham1: I wonder, though, if the presence of mutation-based structure operations has held Scheme programming back somewhat.
[23:53:37] <Zipheir> FP's self-imposed restriction, for the most part, to immutable structures has paid dividends in all of the structures and algorithms discovered in the last 30 years.

[23:54:39] <Zipheir> A lot of those remain obscure in Scheme, maybe because people reach for vectors/hash-tables/etc. whenever lists won't do.

[23:58:23] <Zipheir> Lisp programming has historically been not just "hybrid functional", but *aggressively* hybrid--it can be hard to factor out the imperative parts.
[23:59:11] <Zipheir> Probably just because of folklore--"X has to be done with vectors!  Otherwise it's slow."
