[03:31:29] <MetaNova> 'poorly' sounds more natural of a thing for me (or someone else) to say

[17:35:26] <meator> Hello.
[17:35:29] <meator> Do you remember me? I asked here about "separated by whitespace" and "separated by whitespaces".
[17:35:33] <meator> I asked a English teacher and she said that the word space is in this context countable, therefore "separated by whitespaces" is correct.
[17:35:37] <meator> You have said that only "separated by whitespace" is correct.
[17:39:22] <meator> Which is correct?
[18:08:28] <MetaNova> meator: I feel compelled to say both should be correct, but I feel as if "whitespaces" is the more technically correct term to use
[18:09:13] <MetaNova> since I wasn't here for your original question, I presume you're talking about the whitespace between words

[18:13:36] <meator> Here are some answers that I've got from you:
[18:13:39] <meator> <LuisP18> whitespace: class of separator
[18:13:39] <meator> <huf> you can have whitespace characters, but not whitespaces
[18:22:54] <bin_bat> I agree with meator 
[18:22:56] <bin_bat> er
[18:22:59] <bin_bat> I agree with MetaNova 
[18:23:10] <bin_bat> I don't think whitespace is countable.
[18:23:55] <MetaNova> I think "whitespace" can be both countable and uncountable, depending on context
[18:24:39] <MetaNova> which is why my immediate reaction is to say both are correct
[18:25:06] <MetaNova> but I think they're using it in a countable manner
[18:25:22] *** Quits: HubertFarnsworth (uid349353@user/saganman) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[18:25:24] <MetaNova> meator: can you provide context?
[18:25:32] <MetaNova> I'd like a better idea of just how you're using it
[18:26:04] <bin_bat> hm see I feel like "space" is countable but "whitespace" is a special noun that isn't
[18:26:21] <bin_bat> liike huf said in meator's quote, you don't say "I have 4 whitespaces"
[18:26:29] <bin_bat> you'd say "I have 4 spaces" 
[18:26:37] <bin_bat> hmmmm
[18:26:40] * bin_bat thinks further
[18:26:41] <huf> or "4 whitespace characters"
[18:26:41] <MetaNova> bin_bat: "the whitespace between the graphic and the caption is excessive, you should shrink it to make it look better"
[18:28:49] <MetaNova> interestingly, my en_US dictionary for .. huntspell, I think is used in HexChat, says "whitespace" is correct but "whitespaces" is not correct
[18:29:08] <bin_bat> yeah
[18:29:08] <MetaNova> so, at least, my local spellchecking dictionary thinks it's uncountable
[18:29:49] <MetaNova> but I've found gaps in it before

[20:55:43] <Jong> Which would you say? Do you have a question related to programming? Do you have a question relevant to programming?
[20:59:05] <MetaNova> Jong: I'd use "related to" nearly every time
[21:00:09] <Jong> what about pertinent ?
[21:00:30] <MetaNova> they all basically mean the same thing, with how the question is posed
[21:00:36] <MetaNova> I'd say it comes down to preference
[21:00:55] <LuisP14> would add "that is" if it were with "relevant"
[21:01:05] <MetaNova> (what I would expect myself to say, what I would expect any other random native speaking adult to say, etcetera)
[21:01:27] <MetaNova> LuisP14: as in, "Do you have a question that is relevant to programming?" because, that's not bad
[21:01:38] <LuisP14> yea
[21:01:41] <Jong> pertinent seems like a word whose existence is gratuitous

[21:21:11] <Guest82> Hi. Is this sentence correct?  "I began to study since last Saturday."
[21:21:15] *** Joins: great_taste (~great_tas@190.32.235.20)
[21:23:18] <Guest82> is anyone here?
[21:24:21] <blkshp> No
[21:24:31] <blkshp> That was to the first question.
[21:24:41] <blkshp> Remove the 'since
[21:25:22] <pussipupu> Or use "I have been studying since last Saturday."
[21:25:31] <Guest82> how do I re-sentence it, to keep since in the sentence?
[21:25:34] <blkshp> or that
[21:25:38] <blkshp> :D
[21:25:44] <Guest82> Thanks
[21:26:00] <Guest82> how about this : I have begun to study since last Saturday?
[21:26:27] <blkshp> No
[21:26:37] <Guest82> why?
[21:27:03] <blkshp> Because you can't.
[21:27:22] <Guest82> there must be a reason.
[21:27:25] <blkshp> begun and since cannot co-exist in this sentence.

[21:28:05] <Guest82> It's been said to use since and present perfect with each other?
[21:28:16] <Guest82> WRONG
[21:28:16] <Guest82> He is out of the office since you last phoned.
[21:28:17] <Guest82> As you may recall, the Paris office assists us with this project since it started.
[21:28:17] <Guest82> Mr Jones is employed by the Company since September 2016.
[21:28:18] <Guest82> In these three sentences the writers have made the mistake of using the Present Simple tense (is / assists / is employed) instead of the Present Perfect tense.
[21:28:18] <Guest82> RIGHT
[21:28:19] <Guest82> He has been out of the office since you last phoned.
[21:28:19] <Guest82> As you may recall, the Paris office has assisted us with this project since it started.
[21:28:20] <Guest82> Mr Jones has been employed by the Company since September 2016.
[21:28:25] <blkshp> don't do that
[21:28:35] <pussipupu> I'd say it's not technically invalid but feels clumsy, and means that you started after last Saturday not on it
[21:29:12] <Guest82> pussipupu : If I say that I have been studying since Saturday, does it mean that I have started on it?
[21:29:45] <pussipupu> Yes
[21:30:57] <Guest82> Thank you!
