[01:32:57] <ash_worksi> I'll look at that xq
[01:33:17] <Grinnz> k seems to be an index for that permutation - each unique k you pass will return that specific permutation
[01:33:49] <Grinnz> also, C string functions are unlikely to be as useful for perl strings which are not arrays
[01:34:09] <ash_worksi> Grinnz: I see. so does s define the character set as a string?
[01:34:18] <ash_worksi> and I take it that this is a fixed length too
[01:34:36] <Grinnz> this algorithm is "permutations of an input string", s is that input string
[01:35:17] <xq> std::swap(s[k % (j + 1)], s[j]);
[01:35:23] <xq> and they say perl is write-only language

[07:41:04] <aquanight> also this assumes you're teleporting over a dynamic bianry. I bet ld-linux.so would choke if you tried to feed it a static binary.

[07:44:31] <simcop2387> aquanight: you should be able to exec /dev/stdin for a fully static object.  You don't have to use ld.so in linux
[07:44:56] <simcop2387> Ld.so needs seek, linux doesn't
[07:45:03] <aquanight> simcop2387: you can't exec /dev/stdin directly since it won't have execute permissions. That might be another reason trying to use ld.so would fail

[07:46:52] <aquanight> it will *probably* fail since stdin will be a pipe and won't really have a proper filesystem object to chmod
[07:46:58] <mst> yep
[07:47:03] <mst> nice idea though
[07:47:32] <aquanight> the only other thing I can think of left
[07:47:40] <aquanight> is pack a minimal trampoline subroutine
[07:47:55] <aquanight> to do the memfd_create/dlopen trick
[07:48:02] *** Joins: gryphn (~gryphon@84.17.45.6)
[07:48:23] <aquanight> and shove it into a good spot in /proc/self/mem
[07:48:29] <aquanight> there's probably SOMEWHERE you can safely write to
[07:48:34] <aquanight> without crashing sh
[07:48:47] <mst> AHA
[07:48:54] <aquanight> except it's probably ASLR'd so fuck me
[07:48:56] <mst> import ctypes
[07:48:57] <mst> libc = ctypes.CDLL(None)
[07:48:57] <mst> syscall = libc.syscall
[07:49:06] <aquanight> is this python?
[07:49:08] <mst> yes
[07:49:15] <aquanight> it sure looked like python
[07:49:19] <mst> if I can trampoline off /usr/bin/perl or /usr/bin/python
[07:49:30] <aquanight> okay that gives you two options
[07:49:36] <mst> shoving a tiny binary across as plan C seems acceptable
[07:49:44] <aquanight> which together have maybe an 80% chance to exist on most linux distributions
[07:50:03] <mst> aquanight: exactly my thought
[07:50:09] <aquanight> mst: worst case scenario the first thing the binary does is unlink itself
[07:50:48] <mst> indeed and you can *probably* write to ~/.trampoline-<uuid> fine
[07:51:01] <mst> I just don't want to
[07:51:12] <mst> cos it's more fun that way
[07:51:12] <aquanight> no probably about it, you can just ls around for safe names
[07:51:35] <mst> if you have no perl, no python, -and- a noexec $HOME
[07:51:41] <mst> then I suspect you didn't want this to work
[07:51:41] <aquanight> hell you can tmpname() locally, ssh an ls for it, redo until you get a good one
[07:51:45] <mst> and that's fair enoungh
[07:51:53] <mst> noexec /tmp is more common
[07:52:24] <aquanight> hmm
[07:52:27] <aquanight> true
[07:52:32] <aquanight> ditto /run for that matter
[07:52:45] <mst> I've regularly filed bugs against things that don't survive noexec /tmp
[07:53:01] <mst> because fuck you I'm allowed to set that
[07:53:12] <aquanight> tmp *should* be noexec really
[07:53:18] <mst> whereas noexec $HOME is a delibarete "no, really, don't"
[07:53:22] <aquanight> nosuid/nodev/noexec
[07:53:25] <mst> so failing given -that- seems fine to me
[07:53:43] <simcop2387> hmm, how restricted is mkfifo usually?
[07:53:45] <mst> aquanight: yes, that's what I believe, but I keep breaking things by continuing to believe it
[07:54:12] <mst> simcop2387: still wouldn't be seekable, though using socat and a unix socket might be good for a laugh even so
[07:54:12] <simcop2387> Sh+mkfifo bootstrap
[07:54:13] <aquanight> simcop2387: I think it's just basic file permissions
[07:54:30] <aquanight> the fifo is still not seekable
[07:54:40] <aquanight> but it might give you something to use with straight exec and a static binary
[07:54:52] * mst thinks "perl or python or writing a trampoline or figure it out yourself" isn't a bad start
[07:54:53] <aquanight> but at that point just populate a normal file and quit monkeying around with weird shit
[07:54:57] <aquanight> you've already hit the desk
[07:55:03] <mst> exactly my thought
[07:55:11] <aquanight> the disk*
[07:55:13] <simcop2387> that's what I'm thinking.  It'd let you get anpther bootstrapper
[07:55:31] <aquanight> the point of the perl/python part is a completely diskless bootstrapper
[07:55:38] <aquanight> the filesystem is not even looked at
[07:55:57] <aquanight> and I'm wondering if it can be done with sh
[07:56:02] <simcop2387> A ffifo automatically removes itself though but yea it's not strictly diskless
[07:56:04] <aquanight> but I just don't know how it can be
[07:56:20] <simcop2387> Not diskless as far as I can tell
[07:56:24] <mst> simcop2387: meh
[07:56:41] <aquanight> also with mkfifo you have to get your order of operations right or you just wedge yourself good
[07:56:53] <aquanight> step 1: sh -c "exec fifo" &
[07:57:03] <aquanight> step 2: write to fifo
[07:57:19] <aquanight> get those backward and your write blocks
[07:57:21] <mst> yay, 13.0 should be booting shortly
[07:57:43] <mst> gods but I love freebsd
[07:58:57] <mst> but yeah, syscall.ph or libc.syscall to bootstrap
[07:59:02] <mst> and we're off to the races
[07:59:08] <Grinnz> don't tell andrew lee or he'll buy it and fold it into bsd.com
[07:59:12] <simcop2387> bet there's a ruby way too then

[08:05:56] <aquanight> simcop2387: 5-second google comes up nothing for TCL
[08:07:26] <mst> tcl is intentionally built to not let you pull that shit
[08:07:59] <mst> aquanight: anyway, if I want to try it for tcl, I'll just ask my friends on the core team
[08:08:02] <aquanight> tcl is, largely, just a superbash
[08:08:17] <mst> ... you underestimate tcl
[08:08:45] <aquanight> I mean it can do some crazy stuff
[08:08:52] <mst> "bash bitten by a radioactive lisp"
[08:08:52] <aquanight> but it's also the language where everything is strings
[08:08:57] <simcop2387> sqlite uses tcl heavily iirc
[08:09:07] <rewt> sqlite was made for tcl
[08:09:08] <simcop2387> for all it's building system and tests and everything
[08:09:09] <mst> aquanight: yes, but cleverly so
[08:09:15] <aquanight> I mean yes
[08:09:30] <aquanight> but really I don't think any distro mains TCL
[08:09:31] <mst> I implemented 'unless' for tcl in about 5 lines
[08:09:38] <aquanight> it's pretty much python, perl, or pure sh and torture
[08:09:53] <mst> right, python, perl, or CBT are about your options
[08:10:03] <aquanight> cbt?
[08:10:37] <simcop2387> cognitive behavioral therapy
[08:10:37] <mst> cock and ball torture ;)
[08:10:53] <simcop2387> mst: i figured as much
[08:10:56] <aquanight> also for bonus points
[08:11:09] <mst> but like 'C and bash torture' also works
[08:11:14] <simcop2387> damn lto7 tape drives are still too damned expensive
[08:11:15] <aquanight> do you check that the client and server are same arch?
[08:11:16] <mst> so if we ever have to explain it to our parents
[08:11:33] <mst> aquanight: I'm assuming I'll have to fire a uname first
[08:11:45] <aquanight> and if uname fails?
[08:12:04] <simcop2387> uname syscall from perl
[08:12:04] <mst> then I give the sysadmin a golden shower and tell them to try again
[08:12:10] <aquanight> because I just realized one type of system you could end up ssh'd to, could have perl, but will have neither uname nor even sh
[08:12:11] <simcop2387> if that fails, then go "fuck you"
[08:12:22] <aquanight> and it's a perfectly legit system in some parts of the world
[08:12:31] <mst> ssh into windows is a later problem
[08:12:35] <aquanight> lol
[08:12:42] <aquanight> but to be fair
[08:12:47] <simcop2387> mst: i kinda want an ssh into dos still
[08:12:49] <aquanight> you have powershell there
[08:13:04] <aquanight> which means you can teleport .NET assemblies into your remote shell to get executable control
[08:13:06] * mst refuses to believe powershell is really spelled with an 's'
[08:13:20] <aquanight> but I don't think you can load from memory
[08:13:28] <aquanight> memory files*
[08:13:36] <aquanight> I don't even know if memory files are properly a thing. I'd have to find out.
[08:13:52] <aquanight> but even so I don't think LoadLibary() has a version to take a pre-opened HANDLE
[08:14:05] <simcop2387> yea lto6 tapes are still the sweet spot on the second hand market.  $500 for a preowned drive (up to $1k depending), instead of 3.5k for a used lto7 drive, and 4k new

[08:14:46] <aquanight> fair enough
[08:14:46] <mst> so debian+perl, ubuntu+perl, and CentOS/RHEL+python
[08:14:53] <aquanight> build for the use case you have, not the insane use case you don't give a shit about
[08:14:55] <mst> would put me -way- ahead of the game
[08:15:42] <aquanight> yeah
[08:15:50] <aquanight> perl and python trampolines would be more than adequate
[08:16:31] <mst> right, and then for everything else, shipping a small binary across is fine
[08:17:02] <zgu> i don't know how well a python trampoline would work. snakes can't really jump
[08:17:14] <simcop2387> ah that's why lto7 is still so fucking expensive, lto9 got delayed *again*.
[08:17:15] <aquanight> are you kidding
[08:17:23] <aquanight> aren't snakes like basically a biological spring?
[08:17:56] <simcop2387> holy heck lto8 drives are cheaper than lto7.

[20:20:38] <Grinnz> probably not, it's not called paperbot anywhere

[20:53:34] <simcop2387> so far all the arguments about copilot being fully legal and kosher don't hold water to me.  they hold water that copilot itself is probably legally fine, but the code coming out of it is quite possibly not fine for the human who selects it.  i.e. the copilot model, service, etc. are all fine to build based on current law but you have to then vet everything coming out of it that it isn't directly
[20:53:40] <simcop2387> from a non-kosher source.  the transformed bits that aren't direct copies are a bit more difficult to reason about still and would likely end up having to be worked out by a judge in current US law

[23:21:15] <gordonfish> { Re: <thrig> Romulan B____ Gorn } Breen?
[23:22:19] <gordonfish> simcop2387: As in Windows for arm? Isn't that the RT (a very limited, tablet centric) version?
[23:22:19] <simcop2387> gordonfish: once things are more known and stable i'll have more of it opened up to the public but right now it's literally just a windows 10 install on a raspberry pi and a compiler downloaded
[23:22:22] <mjgardner> Just had to code review a thing that was doing `grep { $_ =~ /foo/ } $bar`.
[23:22:44] <simcop2387> gordonfish: not quite anymore, they've dropped the whole RT thing
[23:23:16] <gordonfish> windows 10 on a RPI... didn't the geneva convention have something about that?
[23:23:33] <gordonfish> Seems so wrong
[23:23:47] <mjgardner> (should be just `$bar =~ /foo/`)
[23:24:12] <gordonfish> mjgardner: Some people like to be verbose
[23:24:33] <mst> do { my $re = 'foo'; map { $_ =~ m/${re}/ ? ($_) : () } $bar };

[23:24:55] <gordonfish> Ah, right yeah that could just be $bar =~ /foo/, I was looking at the $_ =~ /foo/ part that first, which could just be /foo/
[23:25:37] <gordonfish> mst: Golfing is fun, but watch out for sand traps
[23:25:41] <mjgardner> I told them that Larry should have spelled it `filter` but he's more of a Unix-head than computer scientist.

[23:34:22] <gordonfish> I always found grep to be sort of fitting. gerp(1) on the command line looks for units (lines) matching a pattern. Perl's grep looks for units (elements) matching a pattern. Same idea in the abstract, just different labels (line vs element.)
[23:35:09] <mjgardner> Yah, but apparently someone was taking the generalization too far and thinking they have to use `grep` for all regexen.
[23:35:15] <mst> oof
[23:37:28] <mjgardner> I wrote a blog trying to demystify `map` and `grep`. I still see people using loops when either would be preferable. https://phoenixtrap.com/2021/03/16/perl_map_grep/
[23:37:29] <gordonfish> { Re: <gordonfish> { Re: <gordonfish> { Re: <thrig> Romulan B____ Gorn } Breen? } Or Borg. } And how could I forget the Bynars.

[23:39:12] <mst> gordonfish: wrt win10 on an RPI, the only possible response is 'BONK! Go to nerdy jail!'

[23:40:45] <gordonfish> mst: I just have a hard time beliving win10 can run really efficiently on one of those, unless it's a stripped down version like 'XP Embedded' and similar for Win7 that was meant for thin clients then.
[23:41:28] <mst> gordonfish: a recent rpi's arm chip is more powerful than a lot of machines of a few years back
[23:44:32] <gordonfish> I haven't looked at the specs of the more recent RPIs, so I wasn't aware of how far they had jumped ahead. RPI 3 and earlier, that would definitely struggle.

[23:51:10] <mjgardner> Grinnz: I love the “Junior fullstack javascript developer fresh out of bootcamp” epithet. Twitter is overrun with content for them as well.
[23:51:46] <Grinnz> yup, that's the lesser problem facing dev.to right now
[23:51:56] <Grinnz> and the harder one to deal with
[23:52:40] <mjgardner> As long as people keep pouring into that demographic I don’t see it changing.
[23:54:18] <The_Blode> My colleague at work told me don't bother with Perl. Learn what employers currently want.
[23:54:20] <The_Blode> smh
[23:55:14] <daemon> The_Blode, that is good advice on a junior level - but learn perl as well, a niche language if you are good enough is consultant cheques
[23:56:18] <mst> The_Blode: learn things that are lucrative and learn things that you enjoy
[23:56:25] <mjgardner> I keep saying if you want to be treated like a commodity you go for what’s popular, but don’t be surprised if you’re not as valued.
[23:56:29] <mst> The_Blode: if nothing else, the latter will make you a better programmer
[23:56:30] <The_Blode> Actually, I like Perl a lot
[23:56:51] <The_Blode> Although sites online are touting it as "extinct" as of 2021
[23:57:04] <The_Blode> I told my colleague of Mojolicious and how good it looked...he said don't bother
[23:57:10] <mjgardner> Perl is dead. Film at 11.
[23:57:23] <mst> The_Blode: well the same team are also doing mojo.js now, maybe you can use that as a gateway drug
[23:57:38] <mjgardner> That story has been told for twenty years now.
[23:57:38] <The_Blode> Hmm interesting
[23:57:47] <daemon> The_Blode, I am not going to go into this in depth, but openssl requires perl to be 'made/compiled' it might be dead in the face of the web, but if perl goes bye bye a lot will follow it, a vast amount infact
[23:57:47] <mst> and, yeah, 'perl is dead' is something I've been hearing since at least 2005
[23:58:21] <mst> and yet we're still here
[23:58:25] <daemon> everyone forgets what makes the foundations of their applications
[23:58:45] <mst> fuck, apt/dpkg rely on perl
[23:58:58] <daemon> hey I am a BSD user so I get to be double dead, I wonder if I am immortal
[23:59:05] <mst> so like every single cloud server running ubuntu needs it
[23:59:07] <mst> daemon: ahahahahahahaha
[23:59:08] <The_Blode> What did Python did that Perl didn't? Perl predates Python
[23:59:17] <The_Blode> Is Perl not as capable or more so than Python?
[23:59:31] <mst> The_Blode: I often say anything you can do in one you can do in the other
[23:59:45] <nirnam> python did somehow compile they code as they run, slow but sure if you leave it run long enough it speed exceed perl
[23:59:59] <mst> and note I often say this to encourage people to learn both and pick the one they like better
