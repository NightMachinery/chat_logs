[00:51:20] <KDev> I have these two different nav bars. What would be your go to in ReactJS to change the style on this navbar depending on the page component? So..I have a Layout Component that renders the Header Component, and then the Page Component will be the dynamically loaded content. The layout would not be re-rendered every page change, but I want the header background to change on certain pages.
[00:52:14] <KDev> What would be the best approach to go about this? I guess a boolean in the header file to check the route and apply the styles accordingly? That seems kind of bad practice though. I want a developer to open up the Page Component and see every change in there.

This sounds bad because if multiple files do this in different components, then it will get messy. Two: have my Layout Component said a callback function to my Page Component (child), and in this Page Component, I can use the callback function to change a style of the parent.

[15:46:23] <ThePhilgrim> since_: Sorry, I'm a complete beginner. How would I "take HTTP data"? Would this be a Node script sitting on the server?

[15:47:32] <Svitkona> you can run a webserver with plain node
[15:47:38] <Svitkona> or you can use something like express

[15:57:31] <since_> ThePhilgrim: do you have ssh access?
[15:57:47] <ThePhilgrim> Svitkona, since_ It seems like my shared hosting only supports PHP. So, could I send the form data to the server with fetch() and then use PHP/PHPMailer to send it to the e-mail?

[15:58:29] <DPA> Is there a good way to print stack traces for all the things blocking the main loop in nodejs?

I'd like to dump what's still blocking the main loop before that.

[16:15:06] <seabass> Hello! One thing I've noticed with typical React projects with NPM is that there are static files in the public/ directory
[16:16:07] <seabass> when you build your Javascript code, it's usually minified and then goes into public/
[16:16:37] <seabass> this seems a little messy to me, as you have a mixture of version controlled, static files and not-version-controlled generated files in one directory.
[16:17:02] <seabass> does anyone here have any examples of projects where this is not the case, and the public directory is always created anew from other files? Thanks!
[16:17:40] <Alexendoo> I can't think of a particular example, but that's common as well
[16:18:13] <Alexendoo> Usually by using copy-webpack-plugin

[17:19:21] <OhTheCode__> you'll need to learn some basic Node.js, then you can accept POST requests
[17:20:00] <han-solo> it doesn't necessarily have to be formData i think, you could just json stringify the object you have

[20:07:39] <ThePhilgrim> OhTheCode__, Svitkona - Sorry, I had to leave for a bit. Back now. OhTheCode__: What does "CORS" mean? I assume you're talking about the charset error?  Svitkona: What do you mean that I'm not serving the page I want? I don't really understand the "server code" I sent. I just pasted it from stackoverflow.
[20:08:00] <Svitkona> your server only does one thing, which is respond to requests with "hello world"
[20:08:12] <ThePhilgrim> Does the NPM http server support POST requests? Because Python's http server doesn't
[20:08:23] *** Quits: reallymemorable (~reallymem@70.107.110.8) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:08:23] <ThePhilgrim> Svitkona: Ah, okay.. So it's not at all what I want :D
[20:08:30] <Svitkona> you can modify it like i did
[20:08:52] <ThePhilgrim> Ah okay, I'll check the code!
[20:09:00] <han-solo> ThePhilgrim: the python http server can, but that's not a path i'd take.
[20:09:09] <OhTheCode__> i got it working
[20:09:17] <Svitkona> or you can have separate servers for the API and the frontend
[20:09:17] *** Joins: reallymemorable (~reallymem@70.107.110.8)
[20:09:27] <OhTheCode__> u need an extra plugin for the body parsing in express
[20:09:28] <Svitkona> which is maybe what you should do
[20:09:55] <ThePhilgrim> han-solo: Okay, would you care to explain why? Overly complicated?
[20:10:02] <OhTheCode__> cors is something that protects browsers, it adds in headers and blocks things that are not the same domain and port number, u will run into it a lot early on
[20:10:38] <ThePhilgrim> Hmm, okay. Trying to follow you guys. But I'm really new to this so the information is slightly overwhelming :D
[20:10:44] <ThePhilgrim> Express is a Node library, right?
[20:11:22] <ThePhilgrim> Later I have to use PHP when I actually publish my website. Now I'm just trying to use whatever to learn fetch() and see that my POST request works at all
[20:11:51] <systemfault> Yes.
[20:13:47] <OhTheCode__> here is the server code that u need - https://dpaste.com/BQTZGMGTP
[20:14:01] <ThePhilgrim> Okay, so since I wont be using Node at all later for my actual website, it seems that using Express would be overkill for this testing
[20:14:36] <Svitkona> express is pretty simple, but sure
[20:15:50] <OhTheCode__> if u are sending data, just use this simple express script and it's gonna help u if u are sending data, u can see that it's being sent correctly, u need to understand what's going on, it's a good time to get your learn about headers, request and response
[20:15:58] <ThePhilgrim> Svitkona: I'm sure it is. But to learn it before even knowing Node might be too much for right now :)
[20:16:00] *** Quits: reallymemorable (~reallymem@70.107.110.8) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:16:07] <han-solo> ThePhilgrim: it's very basic and not very friendly, and definitely not meant for production. I'd use something like fastapi or flask if doing python, or express or fastify if js

[20:20:31] <ThePhilgrim> Now I'm trying to understand how fetch() works so that I can send the data to the server
[20:20:57] <ThePhilgrim> But I've been using Python's http server while building the website and now I realize it doesn't support POST natively.

[21:05:20] <ThePhilgrim> I can't seem to debug it successfully
[21:07:25] <davis> hello, I'm trying to make a webapp with a .css, .html, .styles files.  I had a working browser opens index.html file and the three files are used.  However, I need to make the dynamic part using a node lib.  I used a method to make a server.js which when run loads, the index.html, script.js and styles.css, but that script.js still can not load the node lib used to generate output.
[21:07:40] <ljharb> ThePhilgrim: same thing tho, use a service for that
[21:07:53] <davis> is there a stack overflow page which might provide a method to do this?
[21:10:21] <ThePhilgrim> ljharb: Well, I was planning to use SMTPJS (smtpjs.com) first. But I don't want to have the token client-side, so I was told by somebody to keep that on the server and use fetch() to send the data to the server

[22:23:09] <tempest> My team has found Redux to still be helpful since things like combineReducers() and persistence libraries usually work with Redux but take some extra effort to get working with anything else.
[22:23:41] <tempest> We have been moving portions of our Redux store that don't need to be global into page-specific reducer contexts though - it just depends on what you need for each situation.

[22:30:26] <Intelo> tempest so if we ignore combineReducers() and persistence libs,  we don't need redux? and useReducer() and useContext would be enough?

[22:32:35] <tempest> Yeah if you don't need any other libraries to integrate with it then the only other thing Redux has that reducer+context doesn't is that Redux's mapStateToProps and useSelector functions will avoid unnecessary component re-renders if an unrelated part of the store changes.
[22:33:07] <tempest> Like if the store is updated but the portion you extract with useSelector() is still equal (by reference) then it doesn't trigger a component re-render.
[22:33:16] <tempest> But if your reducer is small enough that probably doesn't matter.

[22:33:52] <Intelo> I see.
[22:34:18] <Intelo> tempest where to put ajax calls if using redux? actions of course?
[22:35:01] <tempest> That is the conventional place to put them yeah, but you don't necessarily have to.  If your code is already organized so all your ajax calls are somewhere else then there's no reason your reducers can't just accept the results of those calls.
[22:36:37] *** Joins: Colt (~Colt@user/colt)
[22:36:38] <Intelo> tempest ok what do you actually use for ajax place?
[22:38:02] <tempest> Our main project has a few service files that just export async functions for performing certain API actions.  They're more or less like what you'd put in a Redux action but without the redux bits.
[22:38:34] <tempest> We organized it that way because not every part of our app's state is in Redux and there were some ways of handling API calls that we wanted to be consistent across all of it.
[22:39:03] <tempest> Then we either call the service function from a Redux action, or we call it from a component and pass the result into an action.
