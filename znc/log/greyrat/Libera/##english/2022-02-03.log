[06:04:08] <Me-me> Seems straightforward to me.

[06:04:23] <LjL> "how would you explain Arcane", especially with a capital A, makes me think it's a book or a game or something

[06:07:47] <cthulchu> I really don't like the "Understood by only a few" definition.
[06:07:49] <LjL> they probably mean that the definitions provide a correct description of the denotation but not so much, or not so satisfactorily, of the connotation.
[06:07:53] <cthulchu> way too vague
[06:07:57] <Me-me> If you think about it, a dictionary will always end up using circular logic to define anything within itself - as every definition that is made of written words will necessitate other words to be defined, and those definitions will require other definitions, etc.
[06:08:19] <Me-me> cthulchu: No it's not, that's what "arcane" means.
[06:08:27] <cthulchu> that's fine, I don't mind certain circularity
[06:08:31] <cthulchu> really?
[06:08:35] <Me-me> Yes, as opposed to common knowledge or widely understood.
[06:08:44] <cthulchu> I always thought that this word implies certain mysticism
[06:08:51] <cthulchu> magic, even, maybe
[06:09:12] <Me-me> It is often used in a fantasy setting, but "arcane magic" just implies a magic that is only knowable by those who have done the dedicated study of it.
[06:09:34] <cthulchu> as opposed to what? Widespread magic?
[06:09:46] <Me-me> Well, as opposed to a setting that allows for widespread magic, yes.
[06:10:15] <Me-me> A wizard who pores over tomes and learns the ways that the metaphysical functions can turn air into fire has learned "arcane" knowledge, because not everybody knows that.
[06:10:17] <twb> arcane magic as opposed to hedge magic
[06:10:19] <cthulchu> still, if the meaning of the word is so trivial, and the word is short and easy, why is it so rarely used?
[06:10:34] <Me-me> Linguistic shift. Personally, I love using the word when appropriate.
[06:10:36] <twb> It's like the difference between university and polytechnic
[06:10:46] <LjL> because that's not how words get "chosen" for continued use by their speakers.

[06:14:43] <cthulchu> or maybe it is most frequently used as a supplement to magic
[06:14:54] <twb> well when I use it it's usually in reference to something like SCSI
[06:15:04] <cthulchu> even in the series it implies magic
[06:15:12] <cthulchu> what?

[06:15:14] <cthulchu> really?
[06:15:21] <twb> "But if it is a differential SCSI chain, you need two goats, one black and one white, and two ceremonies: kill the black goat at high noon and the white one at midnight. Same silver knife for both, of course.  Otherwise, the chain will be unbalanced and things just get worse from there as all the drives do the `washing machine' dance...  Self-terminating devices merely need to be left with sufficient livestock and
[06:15:21] <twb> they'll take care of the rest."  -- Graham Reed
[06:15:22] <cthulchu> SCSI used to be pretty popular
[06:15:30] <cthulchu> in servers
[06:16:22] <cthulchu> yeah, they were not perfect
[06:17:24] <cthulchu> well maybe it's cuz I've never saw arcane used as a normal adjective.

[20:34:11] <Bayes> oh, are they?
[20:34:26] <Bayes> is any of those more common / preferred in ame?
[20:35:29] <pussipupu> Agreed
[20:35:30] <CuriosTiger> I think I'd have a slight preference for "Who would the best player be?"
[20:35:34] <CuriosTiger> But it's not a strong preference.
[20:36:04] <pussipupu> Word order is relatively free with "to be"
[20:36:17] <Bayes> crazy, replace would be with is
[20:36:29] <Bayes> who is the best player? vs who the best player is?
[20:36:37] <CuriosTiger> Yes, but English loves to put a million words between the main and auxiliary verbs. Just to make sure you're paying attention. :)
[20:36:39] <Bayes> they don't sound so similar
[20:37:09] <huf> replace "be" with "eat" and the two versions mean different things
[20:37:14] <CuriosTiger> Bayes: Yeah, "Who the best player is" doesn't work. It's because in that sentence, "is" is the only verb, and English is generally SVO.
[20:37:20] <huf> this really only works with "be" :)
[20:37:26] <CuriosTiger> But with auxiliary verbs, the word order is more free.
[20:37:37] <Bayes> hm
[20:38:05] <pussipupu> yeah it's partly the auxiliary
[20:38:07] <Bayes> so SVO + Auxiliary, SAVO ~ SAOV?
[20:38:23] <CuriosTiger> huf: Not really. "Who would the best player kill" and "Who would kill the best player" also both work, albeit with an extreme difference in meaning, so it's not quite fair to compare the two. :)
[20:38:45] <huf> CuriosTiger: yes. which is what i said
[20:39:03] <Bayes> yeah the sad reality that you gotta go one a case by case basis
[20:39:04] <CuriosTiger> Bayes: It's hard to define elegant rules for the use of auxiliary verbs.
[20:39:24] <CuriosTiger> The reality is that there are lots of corner cases.
[20:39:26] <Bayes> yeah just get used to and be ok if you sound a bit weird cause you were born on the wrong side of the border :)
[20:39:51] <CuriosTiger> Bayes: Where are you from?
[20:40:01] <pussipupu> because the copula doesn't have an object
[20:40:14] <Bayes> way south the border :P
[20:40:19] <Bayes> another question btw
[20:40:21] <pussipupu> it has a subject and a subject compliment
[20:40:26] <CuriosTiger> Because if you were born on the "wrong side" of the US border, you most likely speak Spanish, in which case I'd like to have a word with you about ser and estar. :P
[20:40:31] <pussipupu> So... Estonia?
[20:40:40] <CuriosTiger> pussipupu: Well, he was asking about AmE.
[20:40:50] <huf> pussipupu: must be serbia
[20:40:50] <Bayes> CuriosTiger yeah I'm up for that discussion he
[20:40:56] <pussipupu> Fair
[20:41:10] <pussipupu> I'm changing my guess to Antarctica
[20:41:11] <CuriosTiger> But of course, WAY south of the border could mean Brazil.
[20:41:14] <huf> or even north south macedonia
[20:41:36] <Bayes> So I was writing "more than one" and thought I'd try to find shorter, more specific word for that. Found this resource: https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/another-word-for/more_than_one.html
[20:41:44] <CuriosTiger> In which case I'd still like to have a word about ser and estar.

[20:50:38] <bin> am I the only one who thinks an "open" project for definitions is a terrible idea?
[20:52:23] <CuriosTiger> I have some concerns, but I also like having resources like Wiktionary.
[20:52:47] <pussipupu> It probably does no harm for us both to post the same link :p
[20:52:54] <CuriosTiger> and after all, it's not like they're authoritative. Just like wordhippo and webster and etymonline, they'll get judged by the quality of their entries.
[20:53:27] <pussipupu> Corporate control doesn't obviously lead to better results than community work, and open culture is a public good
[20:53:47] <pussipupu> So I'm sure you're not the only one, but I strongly disagree
[20:54:39] <CuriosTiger> In the "open" world, things that are boring or tedious do tend to get ignored.
[20:55:03] <CuriosTiger> so I think there are some benefits to "corporate control" too. But the world is big enough for both.
[20:55:11] <pussipupu> Also Wiktionary is a wonderful resource for what I mostly use it for which is an interlingual dictionary, and I'm not aware of any closed alternatives that get close in scope or quality
[20:56:06] <CuriosTiger> pussipupu: I don't think anyone can compete in scope, but I'd argue some commercial dictionaries are comparable or even superior in quality.
[20:56:19] <CuriosTiger> On the plus side, when I find an error in Wiktionary, I can simply...fix it.

[22:38:41] <LjL> i was going to try answering the question anyway...
[22:39:01] <LjL> xx, there are better-sounding things than espeak, try festival or even flite. on Android, i recommend RHVoice too

[22:39:13] <xx> I need something intelligible to a non-native speaker
[22:39:25] <LjL> although espeak is better for readingveryfast and so it is a favorite of blind users'
[22:39:43] <xx> I've tried festival, haven't heard of flite will check it out, thanks
[22:40:01] <LjL> xx, flite is Festival Lite, so it will sound worse then Festival (assuming similar voices)
[22:40:14] <xx> damn
[22:40:54] <LjL> xx, if you have Android, the voices at https://rhvoice.org/en-voices/ can be previewed from their app on F-Droid

[23:01:01] <ntz> >> sorry for saying so but it's terrible BS .. I've bought it, tried it and threw it away ... it's so noisy that every time I did use it in the great wilderness I was feeling very uncomfortably and I had felt like disturber and the violator of the calmness around me which I was supposed to kindly and undisruptively share with whatever lived around there and consider it there as a home .. <<
[23:01:38] <ntz> ^^ or perhaps it's usable like that ? isn't it ?

[23:31:40] <pussipupu> good explanation too
[23:34:24] <paul424> Ladies walking with two or more dachshunds on a leash was a very common sight, and the breed somehow fitted the mundane reality of the Polish People’s Republic: not too big, not too small, cheap in upkeep and (what is always important in a police state) highly unobtrusive.
