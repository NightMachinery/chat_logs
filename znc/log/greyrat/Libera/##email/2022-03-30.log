[10:19:07] <dob1> I have a python script that send some email via an external smtp, what I noticed testing is that it doesn't add the Date header, I suppose this is not mandatory. The problem is that in claws mail for example the mail doesn't have a Date
[10:19:53] <dob1> I can try to add it maybe
[10:20:45] <pj> I believe that Date: is actually a mandatory header.
[10:20:52] <pj> !smtp
[10:20:53] <dig-dug> pj: smtp: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is an Internet standard for electronic mail (email) transmission. First defined by RFC 821 in 1982, it was last updated in 2008 with Extended SMTP additions by RFC 5321, which is the protocol in widespread use today. See !esmtp
[10:21:05] <dob1> Delivery-date
[10:21:08] <dob1> or Date ?
[10:21:14] <pj> Date:
[10:21:47] <dob1> I don't have it and the mail is delivered
[10:22:13] <pj> right, it will normally get delivered.
[10:22:26] <pj> That doesn't mean it's valid as per spec
[10:23:27] <dob1> ah, I was not aware on this, because I noted only testing on claws. Gmail for example show a Date for the email
[10:27:14] <pj> https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc822#section-4.1
[10:27:31] <dob1> but, it is not a bit unsafe for the mail client to rely on the date on an header generated by the client that send the email?
[10:27:48] <pj> Creation time, author id & one address required
[10:28:02] <pj> Creation time here refers to the Date field, iiuc
[10:29:03] *** Joins: Giovanni (~Giovanni@194.169.217.179)
[10:30:34] <pj> dob1: well, where do you expect an MUA to show the date from?  I suppose it could also be unsafe to rely on the subject, or the body of the message because those also come from the originating MUA.
[10:31:00] <dob1> delivery date is more accurate imho
[10:31:10] <dob1> this is generate by the server
[10:31:47] <pj> If you have such a field in your email headers you are welcome to set your MUA to display it.
[10:36:50] <dob1> for example Thunderbird too doesn't rely on Date to display the message Date

[11:28:22] <BranchPredictor> because Thunderbird, like others, assume message retrieval date as "Date:" header when one is absent
[11:29:25] <BranchPredictor> OTOH, "Date:" header set by MUAs is usually message storage date (that is, when user clicked "send", "send later", "save", etc)

[22:36:50] <mpldr> Hello, has anyone encountered "special behaviour" (like GMail's ignoring of periods) or "odd" subaddressing separators? I'm trying to normalize emails and am lacking some more examples.
[22:38:08] <Habbie> i've seen + and - for subadressing
[22:38:15] <Habbie> there's servers that ignore case and those that don't
[22:39:17] <mpldr> By default I have + as subaddressing separator and localpart to lowercase transformation as this seems to be the most common configuration
[22:39:28] <Habbie> sounds right to me
[22:40:10] <mpldr> I just wanted to have some "presets" for popular services
[22:40:49] <mpldr> for more exotic settings

[23:04:24] <jaybe> the periods in gmail prefixes aren't actually relevant, although they can be for auth
[23:07:45] <dminuoso> mpldr: regarding "special behavior" yes.
[23:08:13] <dminuoso> Unusual characters, even '+', are frequently not allowed in email forms left and right.
[23:09:31] <dminuoso> My last favourite example is DHL delivery stations, which when you want to send a package with, allow you to enter an email for notification. They even have an email-specific keyboard, with buttons for '@google.com' and so forth, and a secondary keyboard that includes a few unusual mail characters like underscore.. and plus. They *enable* you to enter these addresses.
[23:09:43] <dminuoso> Just to invalidate any such email address in form.
[23:10:26] <mpldr> on android? because then the keyboard is just told "yep, email form field" and shown those characters… that's not DHL
[23:10:43] <mpldr> jaybe: yes, and I was looking for similar oddities
[23:11:34] <jaybe> for auth, if you originally created your id with periods, it "prefers" you continue to do so (for auth); you can email, however, myaddresshere@g…  as one could my.address.here@g  (as originally registered)
[23:12:03] <dminuoso> mpldr: No, on DHL delivery statinos.
