[19:28:07] <gour> hello
[19:29:37] <gour> yesterday while watching some notmuch presentation (Prot) it (finally) clicked in my mind - all the different mailers (claws, evolution, thunderbird, gnus, even mu4e) are directory-based and notmuch is really unique in its own league.
[19:30:00] <gour> so, i've understood that i actually want such mailer ðŸ˜„
[19:30:35] <gour> there are some questions to resolve, mostly due to "infection" of using directory-based apps ðŸ˜‰
[19:31:07] <bremner> well, we do have folder:// searches for people that want them
[19:31:34] <gour> first in regard to actually deleting unwanted emails - is it supposed to use something like  https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Notmuch#Permanently_delete_emails ?
[19:31:51] <gour> bremner: hmm, that i could not see ðŸ˜‰
[19:32:31] <bremner> yes, that snippet matches the notmuch wiki
[19:32:59] <bremner> I'm not sure I would personally put it in my notmuch new hook, but to each their own
[19:34:13] <gour> bremner: so i can still organize my email, iow. the way in which msgs are delivered to Maildir hierarchy  with a few folders considering i use several email acocunts and fetch mail for my wife's as well?
[19:34:28] <bremner> sure.
[19:34:34] <gour> great!
[19:35:24] <gour> in "normal" mailers, one usually keeps copy of sent mail in some "sent" folder. how to handle it with notmuch when using several accounts?
[19:35:37] <lelit> hi gour!
[19:35:40] <gour> is it possible to define "fcc" folders per email account?
[19:35:51] <bremner> gour: in what client?
[19:36:01] <gour> lelit: hiya, old friend! you're always ahead of me ðŸ˜‰
[19:36:06] <lelit> with emacs it's easy
[19:36:06] <gour> bremner: emacs
[19:36:11] <lelit> :-)
[19:36:24] <bremner> gour: then I imagine yes, although I don't have personal experience
[19:36:36] * gour is planning to make the year 2022 the year of Emacs...migrating several apps to it
[19:36:40] <bremner> (with setting fcc on a per account basis)
[19:37:03] <gour> lelit: howto?
[19:37:11] <lelit> https://gitlab.com/lelix/doom.d/-/blob/master/config-lele.el#L103
[19:37:49] <bremner> oh right. does that work with tags also?
[19:39:00] <gour> lelit: thanks, starred ðŸ˜‰ you're using evil-mode? i've decided not to use Doom, but my own config, but still didn't decide in regard to evil-mode
[19:39:55] <lelit> of course not! ;-)
[19:40:43] <gour> lelit: are'you happy with Circe client? i'm considering to switch to ERC hoping it has everything what I need out of the box (including desktop notification)
[19:40:51] <lelit> bremner: I dunno what you mean with that
[19:41:49] <bremner> lelit: with notmuch-maildir-use-notmuch-insert=t, one should be able to use "directories" like "gmail/Sent +gmail" to add the tag gmail
[19:41:53] <lelit> to be honest, I'm using it since a couple of days, and only on my notebook, while at home I still use erc with my ancient emacs-starter-kit
[19:43:10] <lelit> bremner: nice hint, I will surely investigate... again on that newer Emacs setup I'm trying out afew to that
[19:43:39] <gour> lelit: how is Doom without evil?
[19:45:18] <gour> atm, i've old mail archive kept in Claws (MH) which needs to be converted to Maildir and re-tagged. it's year-based
[19:45:50] <lelit> well, good enough: it took a while to accustomize myself to it, mostly to the plethora of packages that it brings onboard, but with the ref-ed configuration my fingers do not cry anymore
[19:46:51] <gour> now i understand i can keep it as it is, just under Maildir, but what to use when i e.g. want at the eoy to move msgs from 'sent' folder into yearly archive?
[19:47:09] <gour> any other approach recommended for notmuch?
[19:47:20] <bremner> typically a shell script.
[19:47:29] <bremner> Or a python script, if you prefer
[19:47:44] <bremner> notmuch-emacs doesn't have any tools for filing
[19:47:51] <gour> i see...thank you!
[19:48:07] <bremner> I think that's why some people prefer mu4e
[19:50:34] <gour> it could be, but i was "enlightened" since even with mu4e and e.g. 3 email accounts, i see that i'm still fiddling with contexts too often, while actually it's more important to clear one's inbox...notmuch approach seems to be more clear
[19:51:53] <gour> lelit: i'm mostly concerned how org & related packages (e.g. org-roam) are covered, iow. if there are some "leaking abstractions" when not using evil
[19:53:27] <lelit> no, but take that with a grain of salt: while I use org a lot, "side" features like roam are still on my "to-learn" list
[19:54:15] <lelit> another thing I want to explore is muchsync, to keep tags in sync between different machines...
[19:55:28] <gour> lelit: i'm waiting for my hdd didk replacement to arrive and then will migrate back to debian/sid (from fedora), but just today when browsing notmuch's docs spotted muchsync ðŸ˜„
[19:55:29] <lelit> until now, I had basically one single machine at home, to deal with email, reaching it via emacs-nox is great for me ;-)
[19:56:52] <lelit> I have one half foot onto NixOS these days
[19:57:24] <gour> i tried it, but was not overly happy...had installation problems
[19:57:41] <lelit> my new email setup (on the notebook) is managed with it's home-manager...
[19:58:15] <lelit> eh, I know the feeling, it helps having a friend who is using it since years
[19:58:50] <lelit> but once you start being enlighted, it's a game changer
[20:01:54] <gour> i could understand nixos advantages...
