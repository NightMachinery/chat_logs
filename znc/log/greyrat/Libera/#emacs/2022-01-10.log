[01:38:11] <nij-> What's a "native module"? And sure, I'm still at the stage of exploring. The problem seems to be that elisp is an ad hoc language and would be good if it could be replaced (without breaking all the codes that have been written).
[01:38:29] <theothornhill> nij-: You want to (defn foo () ...) and then M-x foo?
[01:39:29] <technomancy> nij-: replacements for elisp are a dime a dozen but none of them has ever really succeeded
[01:39:33] <theothornhill> nij-: This has been tried before IIRC.  With guile-emacs and possibly many other things
[01:39:53] <technomancy> probably because elisp works really well at what it's meant for, and that you don't have to have a great language to get great results
[01:40:32] <theothornhill> But is elisp that bad anyways?
[01:40:50] <nij-> theothornhill: yeah more like (defn emacs/foo () ..) and then M-x foo.
[01:41:06] <nij-> It's not bad, but it can be better. I like emacs, so I want to make emacs greater :)
[01:41:07] <technomancy> elisp contains a lot of really bad design decisions in it but most of them have known workarounds
[01:42:55] <crazazy> native modules with clojure sounds like a nightmare
[01:42:58] <theothornhill> My major annoyance is that it blocks, and that's apparently a very hard problem given the amount of shared mutable state
[01:43:34] <nij-> What are native modules @@???
[01:43:34] <fsbot> That's a question you should ask yourself, Megatron!
[01:43:48] <grym> theothornhill: "all of it"?
[01:44:04] <crazazy> nij-: dunno if i got it right but its basically the c-code part of your emacs editor
[01:44:08] <nij-> theothornhill: what blocks? 
[01:44:27] <wgreenhouse> nij-: elisp manual can tell you all about modules. it's limited C FFI for elisp, basically 
[01:44:27] <nij-> C also has to go, according to that talk.
[01:44:27] <theothornhill> nij-: you can write a program as an external module, then load it as a module through a defined api

[02:04:05] <technomancy> welcome to the last twenty years of computing I guess =)

[03:20:52] <sner> for now, they look great, but i'm not sure if the $1000 price tag is worth it (at least for me personally)

[06:49:02] <bobdobbs> k, I'm still re-configuring my emacs (from scratch, trying to emulate my old setup). Now I'm setting up automatic string completions. In my old config I used auto-complete-mode. But I'm having trouble getting this working with web-mode, which is where I spend probably most of my emacs time. So I'm wondering about looking further afield for this functionality.
[06:49:19] <bobdobbs> I'm aware that there are many options out there. What do you guys favour?
[06:50:04] <bobdobbs> Also, if anyone here uses web-mode a lot, what do you use for completions?

[06:50:24] *** Joins: Chanakan5591 (~Chanakan5@user/chanakan5591)
[06:51:00] <bobdobbs> btw, by completions, I mean something like intellisense, where the editor guesses what you are typing after a few characters, and offers a list of candidates for completing the rest of the string
[06:51:04] <corwin> Outside of emacs the main completion component is LSP mode. Emacs can integrate with LSP, so that may be something you want to look into for webdev stuff.  (I'm not using it myself but I did have it going at one point while playing with node/TS)
[06:51:28] <corwin> s/LSP mode/LSP
[06:51:47] <bobdobbs> corwin: yeah, I'm looking into that now. Looks pretty cool, but I have to admit, I'm a little intimidated by it.
[06:52:19] <corwin> feels like a dancing bear to me also so seems reasonable to be concerned about getting bit ;)

[08:47:46] <kby> It’s a bit more complicated, a package I’m using is unfortunately not maintained anymore. I want to download a fork of the package off GitHub. I guess I also need to tell Emacs that this and that package are the same.

[08:52:10] <kby> A backend is a supplier of completions. Company itself is a framework for completion, wherein the backends actually supply the words/terms to autocomplete. By default, the company package also contains some backends for some of the more common file types, but for those that don’t have a supplier by default, you must install an additional backend.

[09:23:04] <sner> my recommendation would honestly be to succumb to the power of using LSP, it's no longer reasonable to expect language-specific editor modes for all languages in all editors, so a huge portion of developer effort has shifted to supporting interoperable language-servers
[09:23:13] <bobdobbs> hmmm
[09:23:13] <sner> is there a reason you aren't using lsp now?
[09:23:19] <bobdobbs> sner: yeah...
[09:23:28] <technomancy> sner: what about for languages where the language-specific editor tools are already great tho?
[09:24:09] <pingpongball> I think i found `describe-font` gives font detail and name
[09:24:30] <bobdobbs> sner: company and autocomplete-mode both look really simple to set up. At least in theory anyway. Autocomplete-mode just looks up a list of completions. I figure that if I can't get that to work, then I shouldn't even look at lsp, which looks like a monster.
[09:24:54] <sner> technomancy: valid point, in those cases it's more than reasonable to keep using the language-specific tools.  my elisp editing doesn't use a language server, for example (though thats cheating to some degree, as emacs and elisp are deeply intertwined)

[09:25:46] <bobdobbs> The other thing is, my issue is a little wider than just js/jsx in web-mode. At the moment I can't company or autocomplete to work with anything in web mode. 
[09:25:48] <technomancy> I still haven't used a language where the LSP was any better than the existing emacs tooling
[09:26:04] <technomancy> (but I am admittedly lucky in being able to be picky with languages)
[09:26:13] <twb> technomancy: AFAICT the whole thing is based on "I need an IDE" because you grew up with C++ instead of a real language
[09:26:32] <bobdobbs> sner: and in theory autocomplete mode should work with minimal config. LSP looks like it needs lots of config, and config for each language
[09:26:34] <sner> bobdobbs: in that case you could find/put together a list of common js vocabulary to get an minimum-viable completion engine running, but the syntactic awareness of a language server would allow you to do much more

[09:49:08] <sner> though i suppose security problems in local elisp code is limited in scope/frequency
[09:49:13] <twb> sner: in principle the Debian security team backports security fixes
[09:49:15] <bpalmer> Something does vaguely bother me about (defconst lsp-ext-unzip-script "bash -c 'mkdir -p %2$s && unzip -qq -o %1$s -d %2$s'" but I'm not sure what. 
[09:49:34] <twb> sner: most elisp things bremner packages in Debian move slowly and don't get updates, security or otherwise
[09:49:54] <twb> bpalmer: hahaha
[09:50:01] <twb> bpalmer: that's CWE 39
[09:50:14] <twb> Sorry https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html
[09:51:37] <technomancy> elisp vulnerabilities tend to be fairly rare because elisp rarely touches untrusted data
[09:51:49] <technomancy> the one with message-mode got patched real quick tho IIRC

[09:51:56] <bpalmer> in theory, this is dealing with trusted data, I think. Again, a pain to read with all this dash and arrow and pcase application

[09:53:19] <bpalmer> But this is doing a download from elisp configuration, which could be assumed to be somewhat trusted, perhaps, at least as far as filenames go.
[09:54:16] <bpalmer> but to answer to a question above: you never have to trust the 'golang community' but you do have to trust whomever writes your lsp server.

[09:54:39] <bpalmer> The available javascript/typescript lsp servers are written in either rust or node/typescript.
[09:55:03] <twb> bpalmer: ah maybe I'm conflating golang with nodejs
[09:55:57] <bpalmer> It's possible some lsp servers are written in go
[09:56:41] <bpalmer> ah, there's "gopls", an "official go language server developed by the go team" (and written in go)
[09:57:09] <twb> it would've been a python lsp-server I was looking for

[13:39:29] <bobdobbs> The only exception really is autocomplete in web-mode

[13:40:06] <bobdobbs> (I haven't tested to see if I've gotten autocompletion in php in webmode yet)
[13:42:12] <binarydigitz01> i actually use typescript-mode for that
[13:42:43] <binarydigitz01> typescript-mode has autocomplete for both typescript and javascript, i think you might check that out
[13:43:06] <bobdobbs> k. I'll check it out
[13:43:23] <binarydigitz01> you'll need (add-hook 'typescript-mode-hook (lambda () (lsp-deferred)))
[13:43:32] <binarydigitz01> to auto start lsp, and it should work
[13:43:37] <bobdobbs> Do you know if  it can run as a minor-mode inside of web-mode?
[13:43:52] <binarydigitz01> pretty sure it can't

[13:47:23] <bobdobbs> I took an adventure in neovim mid last year. It looks pretty. But yeah, the configs were endless tangles
[13:47:46] <bobdobbs> I did like the fast startup time though
[13:47:59] <ap5> I just use evil and get the best of both :D
[13:48:34] <bobdobbs> But everytime I work in an editor that is not emacs, I have the same experience: If I get it config'd to my liking it doesn't matter. There's always a point where I feel like

[13:49:07] <bobdobbs> "this editor is nice. I'm getting comfy with it... but I think I actually want to get some stuff done... so I'd better open emacs"
[13:49:17] <pimeys> I've been using both for ages, and neovim nowadays just if I work on my laptop and I ssh to my workstation so I have LSP working faster with Rust without draining all the battery
[13:49:26] <bobdobbs> Like, other editors simply don't let me move around the buffer as easily.

[13:51:12] <pimeys> but I still like neovim, it's definitely nice when on the road and you just ssh to some machine and you have a full ide
[13:51:38] <pimeys> emacs without a GUI is not super nice IMHO

[22:00:35] <acdw> lmao beer-mode
[22:00:37] <euouae> I also never really used the calendar features of org-mode and I seem to not keep up with tasks 
[22:00:46] <acdw> there is gratis beer recipes out there
[22:00:56] <euouae> can you license food recipes?
[22:01:20] <rpav> euouae: yeah i never really got the hang of org-mode and only vaguely handwave at markdown because it's sortof easy to type and on the off chance i might need to post something to the web
[22:01:33] <acdw> technically jut the stuff around them, copyright doesn't applpy to the actual list of ingredients and method (in the US)
[22:01:55] <euouae> huh. good to know
[22:02:16] <euouae> does that mean that if we write a transpiler from food recipes to some turing complete language we've broken copyright code?

[22:02:26] <mns> euouae: I've been using org-mode for publishing, so the syntax is second nature. I have it setup to save to a .md file as well everytime I save it.
[22:02:57] <bremner> acdw: can you patent recipes?
[22:03:03] <bremner> (in the uS)
[22:03:08] <euouae> mns I suspect that if I had enough expertise with org-mode I would have had kept using it... unfortunately I had too much trouble understanding the finer points of it and so I gave up
[22:03:44] <corwin> mns: similar here- I have a post-commit hook that generates md (and HTML and PDF and txt) from README.org each time I check in my projects.

[22:32:08] <euouae> Unicorn_Princess what I was thinking: if you can find that box of yours in that page, then you can see what the name of the feature is 
[22:32:21] <sm> if you have just a todo list, it's too easy to underestimate/lie to yourself about how long things will take and add too many for the day. If you estimate task times and fit them into a day schedule, you are forced to 1. estimate 2. limit day's tasks based on estimated time 3. see poor estimates
[22:32:26] <euouae> so you can use e.g. `C-h f foo` to read up on it (or C-h v)
