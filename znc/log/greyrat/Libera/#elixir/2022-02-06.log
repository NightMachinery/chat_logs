[05:48:57] <EdFletcher> anyone have hints on how to use cowboy & cowboy_rest with CORS by itself? everything i'm finding requires addition of libraries, which is starting to make me believe it's not simple with bare cowboy and i may be barking up the wrong tree. i've looked at phoenix but it's _extremely_ heavy for my needs, i'm building a simple API server with no need
[05:48:58] <EdFletcher> for all the cruft it comes with, hence why i was hoping something simple like cowboy would be enough. 
[05:50:08] <EdFletcher> specifically I should note it's the cowboy_rest module that i'm having trouble with: granted i realize it's quite old, but for example this writeup make it seem like adding "HEAD" and "OPTIONS" to the allowed_methods would just "take care of it", but i've found that to not be the case 
[05:50:15] <EdFletcher> https://erikmejerhansen.github.io/2016/10/16/REST-services-in-Elixir-with-Cowboy.html 
[05:51:13] <benwilson512> EdFletcher: if Phoenix is feeling heavy I'd consider just plug, since then you could pop in a CORS plug and call it a day
[05:51:35] <benwilson512> This "phoenix in a single file" https://gist.github.com/teamon/a964dd80bc5c6802e3a8548efdda9cff might change your mind about whether Phoenix is actually heavy, but I won't push it
[05:52:31] <EdFletcher> benwilson512: haha yeah Plug was very commonly one of the additional libraries i keep finding, everything seems to need plug on top of cowboy. why is cowboy not full-featured enough to do this on its own though? 
[05:52:56] <EdFletcher> nice example of Phoenix, that's so much less boilerplate than the project generator creates! and i turned _everything_ off with --no-X options too! 
[05:53:13] <benwilson512> EdFletcher: I'm not sure you're going to get good answers about Cowboy's project scope in the elixir channel, given that it is an erlang library
[05:53:56] <EdFletcher> benwilson512: ahhh fair, my bad for that, i'm relatively knew to the ecosystem so often have a hard time differentiating the two! thanks for that note, will ask around those communities too 
[05:54:11] <benwilson512> Plug mostly relegates cowboy to connection management, and then provides a lightweight framework for Elixir oriented middleware on top of that connection
[05:54:18] <benwilson512> Phoenix is basically a bundle of common middleware
[05:54:47] <benwilson512> and then the mix phx.new generator is a "I want to build a batteries included web application" helper on top of that
[05:55:24] <EdFletcher> ahh gotcha, yup that all makes more sense now thank you 
[05:55:31] <benwilson512> EdFletcher: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15616027/enabling-cors-for-cowboy-rest-api this may help
[05:55:48] <benwilson512> in general if you want to push forwarded on the cowboy_rest solution I'd look for answers in erlang
[05:56:04] <benwilson512> there are gonna be very few people using cowboy for HTTP directly in Elixir
[05:56:28] <EdFletcher> yeah that does make sense as well, i suppose i am barking up a bit of the wrong tree in this regard then 
[05:56:42] <benwilson512> certainly not a tree with a lot of other dogs also barking
[05:56:43] <EdFletcher> but cowboy is so simple and boring, and i like simple and boring tools ðŸ˜ƒ 
[05:57:06] <EdFletcher> hahaha true, a quiet tree for sure! 
[05:57:20] *** Joins: james_la1 (~jameslavi@ool-457981b2.dyn.optonline.net)
[05:57:51] <benwilson512> I'd consider Plug, it's also _incredibly_ simple, and you can loop in a lot more of the elixir ecosystem since it's a standard middleware shape
[05:59:06] <benwilson512> Plug's functional approach I think is generally quite nice: functions receive a `conn` and return a `conn` and that's basically the whole thing
[05:59:31] <EdFletcher> benwilson512: awesome that's great to know, I hadn't realized it was so generalized! that's fantastic, will definitely look into it further. thanks a ton for all the great pointers!! 
[06:00:02] <benwilson512> no problem best of luck!
