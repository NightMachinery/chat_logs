[05:18:47] <tbrowder> otherwise it looks  like my module testing is broken (and the same thing happens in git testing)
[05:21:29] <ugexe> mi6 uses TAP to test i presume
[05:22:31] <ugexe> you would remove it via `zef uninstall TAP`
[05:22:47] <ugexe> but then mi6 probably wouldnt work
[05:25:17] <ugexe> might be worth submitting a bug report to TAP
[05:25:26] <ugexe> i get the same behavior 
[05:26:25] <skaji> if you remove this line  https://github.com/tbrowder/DateTime-US/blob/master/t/01-general.t#L8, then the test will pass.
[05:30:12] <tbrowder> skaji: thnx
[05:38:03] <tbrowder> ok, that fixed it, but what is the underlying problem?

[16:23:24] <ugexe> that should prefix the output in such a way that it wont be interpretted as TAP
[16:23:38] <tbrowder> ok…
[16:29:25] <tbrowder> that didn't work, bummer
[16:30:14] <tbrowder> i'm just ignoring  that test for a while, but thanks, very much anyway
[16:34:04] <ugexe> oh right, .show is doing the `say`s
[16:35:49] <ugexe> i guess you could use https://github.com/JJ/raku-io-capture-simple to capture the output so TAP never sees it
[16:36:06] <ugexe> it has a Test::IO::Capture modules it looks like
[16:36:53] <Altreus> IMO test frameworks should set that stuff up for you
[16:36:56] <ugexe> although you probably would just want to use IO::Capture::Simple since using Test::IO::Capture would require you to test for the entire string it outputs
[16:37:07] <Altreus> or at least offer it
[16:37:19] <ugexe> im sure there are some test frameworks that do
[16:38:10] <Altreus> I guess I'm thinking they should black-hole it (or at least diag() it) by default, but if you wanted to test stdout then you can just capture it yourself

[21:20:36] <tbrowder> someone please remind me: given a module with class methods as well as some exported subs with the same name as methods, should the methods use the subs for definition or vice versa? thnx
[21:24:04] <lizmat> the subs should use the methods
[21:24:38] <lizmat> that way someone can add another candidate sub to special stuff, dispatch will then do the right thing
