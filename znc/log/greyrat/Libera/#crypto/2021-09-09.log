[21:04:24] <foo> About to code a user/pass auth system in python/sqlalchemy/postgres. I *think* this will work: I'll have a separate password table with these keys: FK uid, password_hash, salt ... I'll randomly generate a salt per-user like this: salt = os.urandom(hashlib.blake2b.SALT_SIZE) where hashlib.blake2b.SALT_SIZE is 16. Then I'll hash with hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac('sha256', b'password', salt, 100000).hex() ... and I'll 
[21:04:29] <foo> store that hash. Sound about right? Any suggestions? 
[21:06:45] <Alipha> foo: if you're able to use argon2 or scrypt instead of pbkdf2, that'd be preferred
[21:07:59] <foo> Alipha: I'm implementing this and can do that, and preference between argon2 or scrypt? Not looking for bank-level security here but do want to follow best practices. Thank you.
[21:08:41] *** Joins: byteskeptical (~amnesia@user/byteskeptical)

[21:10:02] <ms7821> for "best practice", I'd also consider something like nbvcxz and the HIBP password API to reduce the chance of weak passwords
[21:10:16] <ms7821> sorry, zxcvbn
[21:10:35] <ms7821> passwords are a burden, if you can avoid them that's for the best
[21:11:13] <foo> ms7821: ohh, great idea, thank you. https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2
[21:11:49] <ms7821> also don't forget to use hmac.compare_digest as you didn't mention it
[21:12:01] <Alipha> foo: both argon2 and scrypt are "memory hard" in addition to cpu intensive, which makes it more expensive for attackers to build password cracking rigs, since they'll have to purchase a bunch of RAM in addition to just some cheap cpus. argon2 is newer, slightly more secure than scrypt, and has a clearer API than scrypt
[21:13:23] <foo> Alipha: grateful for the help, thank you.
[21:13:31] <foo> ms7821: thanks, not familiar with hmac.compare_digest - can look into it

[21:13:50] <foo> It looks like https://pypi.org/project/argon2-cffi/ does not use a salt in the example  - do I not need a salt?
[21:14:02] <Alipha> whatever argon2 library you use probably has some default parameters for "interactive mode", which you'll want to use. or go the extra mile and do some benchmarking of how long it takes to perform the hash with different iteration/memory parameters, and determine what parameters to use based upon your resources available and expected number of logins per second
[21:14:16] <Alipha> foo: presumably it auto-generates a salt

[21:25:04] <foo> Alipha / ms7821 - I think this is a good start for storing/updating/verifying the password? https://bpa.st/ZD3A python + sqlalchemy. 
[21:25:07] <foo> oh, /me googles hmac.compare_digest
[21:25:56] <foo> ms7821: I wonder if I need https://docs.python.org/3/library/hmac.html#hmac.compare_digest with how I'm verifying the password in my snippet above? Hmm.
[21:27:13] <ms7821> absolutely
[21:28:34] <foo> ms7821: thank you. If https://bpa.st/ZD3A#1L32 is doing the comparison, how do I implement compare_digest? I'm expecting to compare two hashes with compare_digest 
[21:28:39] <foo> ms7821: But perhaps I'm missing something here. 
[21:29:23] <ms7821> oh right, I didn't see your bpa.st
[21:30:02] <foo> ms7821: aha, thanks. :) So it sounds like my model / functions are good enough for best practice level password management? 
[21:30:06] <foo> and/or Alipha ^
[21:32:31] <ms7821> hmm, what's line 25 doing?
[21:32:57] <foo> ms7821: fetching a specific user id's password hash
[21:33:10] <foo> uid = user's id
[21:33:19] <foo> (I realize it's not as intuitive as it could be)
[21:33:52] <ms7821> but what's with the or bit? won't that get evaluated by sqla and resolve as a constant true?
[21:34:07] <Alipha> foo: i don't really know python, but don't you need return? `return ph.verify(verify_hash, password)`
[21:34:23] <foo> Alipha: heh, thank you. Good catch.
[21:34:25] <ms7821> it throws an exception if verify fails
[21:34:28] <ms7821> so no
[21:34:33] <foo> well, that's true too
[21:34:41] <Alipha> oh, fancy
[21:34:46] <foo> So I guess technically I don't
[21:35:51] <foo> ms7821: I think I've had a nuanced issue here before with the "or" bit and I'm not recalling what that was, exactly. My intent is to use uid *if* it's not set to None (eg. passed in during the function), and fallback to context["uid"] (usually context runs with a uid, from the user that has a context) - am I misunderstanding something here? 
[21:36:48] <ms7821> well I thought == had higher precedence than or but maybe I'm misremembering
[21:37:19] <ms7821> it does seem to
[21:38:02] <ms7821> so you'll get an sqla BinaryExpression or context['uid'] which from memory will not return a new BinaryExpression
[21:38:39] <ms7821> I'd use the standard if uid is None: uid = context['uid']
[21:39:45] <foo> ms7821: I think this is the exact issue I've faced before but I'm not sure I fully understand what was happening. Can you remind me what you mean by " == had higher precedence" ? I'm trying to demonstrate this within python shell. 
[21:40:42] <ms7821> the first evaluation is (Password.uid == uid), which is a BinaryExpression representing the sql `password.uid = :uid`
[21:41:41] <foo> 10:03 < ms7821> but what's with the or bit? won't that get evaluated by sqla and
[21:41:41] <foo>                 resolve as a constant true?
[21:41:50] <ms7821> if you then evaluate a BinaryExpression or (not |) a constant it just returns the constant, which will be context['uid']
[21:42:26] <ms7821> if you evaluate with |, I think it throws a syntax error, which is at least more uesful
[21:42:28] <foo> Ok, I think it will always resolve as a constant true because, for example if uid is not passed, the filter is: .filter(Password.uid == uid or context["uid"]) ... but it's being processed like: .filter(Password.uid == None or context["uid"]) ... so the result is (context["uid"]) which would otherwise be True?
[21:42:57] <ms7821> not quite, but near enough
[21:43:06] <foo> eg. Password.uid == None is False... so it'll use  context["uid"] which is True
[21:43:10] <ms7821> it should throw an exception if you have more than one user in the DB, so maybe just try it out
[21:43:12] <foo> Am I somewhat accurate?
[21:43:26] <foo> uids a primary keys, so there should never be two matches there
[21:43:42] <ms7821> it's more than bool(Password == uid) returns None
[21:43:53] <ms7821> bool(Password.uid == uid) even
[21:44:14] <ms7821> you're creating a valid sqla expression, and then throwing it away by using it in a boolean context
[21:44:40] <ms7821> it's a bit of a gotcha in sqla, I wish it could warn
[21:45:12] <ms7821> (and we're crossing channels again)
[21:45:57] <foo> (Taking to #sqlalchemy to be mindful of channel intent here)
