[00:03:03] <chazy> oh ok, so unless taking micro optimizations into account, it doesn't matter what i use?
[00:03:53] <da_wunder> I would optimize that when you _really_ need that, not before
[00:04:06] <relipse> i would recommend casting an array to an object, rather than having it parse the json

[00:28:53] <da_wunder> so that is not the same...
[00:29:24] <chazy> i'll ssh just to make sure
[00:29:29] <da_wunder> and those typed properties was introduced in php 7.4 - https://stitcher.io/blog/new-in-php-74#typed-properties-rfc
[00:29:43] <chazy> yeah same version in server and workstation
[00:29:52] <da_wunder> also note that cli php might give you different php version than actual webserver
[00:30:25] <chazy> how come? i only have 1 php package installed in server, the one from the arch repo

[00:33:58] <chazy> i only had php56 in my local workstation for testing some old CMR, i never install more than 1 version for production
[00:34:21] <chazy> unless you mean that the same package contains different php versions?
[00:34:32] <chazy> which would be weird and unexpected
[00:35:51] <da_wunder> your 3v4l.org example is working as expected - right? and if that is yes - then just add eg. simple `info.php` to your server with content like `<?php phpinfo();` and check which PHP version you're really using
[00:37:23] <chazy> ok, i'll create a testing route with just phpinfo();
[00:37:41] <chazy> (since i use httpd fallbackresource to index.php)
[00:37:48] <da_wunder> what you shared earlier "22:54 < chazy> https://3v4l.org/1kEA1" is failing on PHP versions <7.4 so that's most likely your problem

[00:39:01] <da_wunder> so create proper 3v4l.org example of your problem
[00:39:28] <chazy> but i'm running the phpinfo() test already

[00:43:09] <da_wunder> currently that is not doing that
[00:43:30] <chazy> the error was from php 5.6, which i didn't remember i had installed and configured in vs code
[00:43:58] <da_wunder> and really don't share those real site urls with phpinfo - that exposes a lot of information about that server that attackers could use...
[00:44:17] <chazy> or you mean that object can't work with the return value of json_decode()?
[00:46:08] <da_wunder> chazy: please produce your _exact_ problem in 3v4l.org example - previously you shared use case doesn't show your actual error that you described: "22:26 < chazy> should "private object $myObj;" give an error? "syntax error, unexpected 'object' (T_STRING), expecting variable (T_VARIABLE)"
[00:47:11] <da_wunder> you shared this example: "22:54 < chazy> https://3v4l.org/1kEA1" and it doesn't show that error at all

[11:36:13] <mariorossi111> never used composer, if i change a file on the repository it's utomatically updated across all codebases using it?
[11:36:25] <TinoDidriksen> No, and you don't want that.
[11:36:28] <Naktibalda> no, you have to run  composer update
[11:36:45] <mariorossi111> why i wouldn't want that?
[11:36:45] <TinoDidriksen> Test first, then deploy.
[11:38:04] <mariorossi111> i wish this codebase was tested, or even that phpunit was a thing here
[11:38:04] <TinoDidriksen> Your deployment step can upload to multiple servers. rsync is great for this. But you should NOT automatically push around manual changes - that's a great way to take down all servers.
[11:38:19] <mariorossi111> makes perfect sense
[11:38:29] <mariorossi111> thanks to both, i'll look into that
[11:38:47] <mariorossi111> i guess there's no way to implement composer on a php5 codebase

[13:05:47] <biberu> mariorossi111: as a next step i'd try to get it running locally, so that you can at least do manual testing before uploading changes
[13:06:12] <biberu> that'd also let you use a proper debugger
[13:06:18] <mariorossi111> xdebug being the best i assume?
[13:06:45] <teresko> depends on what is your goal :D
[13:06:46] <biberu> afaik, but it's been a while since i did php
[13:06:49] <teresko> I would use phpstan
[13:06:51] *** Bitflux is now known as Byteflux
[13:07:03] <biberu> containers are good for running it locally, and would be easy to share with the team once you get them interested in your project
[13:07:14] <teresko> xdebug is more often used as ... emm ... pritiefier for var_dump :D
[13:07:25] <mariorossi111> ahha
[13:07:25] <biberu> teresko: huh?
[13:07:45] <biberu> teresko: if so they weren't using it correctly
[13:08:11] <teresko> biberu: it really is, because most of people find setting up the remote debugging to be painful and/or annoying
[13:08:25] <mariorossi111> with phpstorm it should be real easy
[13:08:41] <mariorossi111> phpstan is on my list of stuff to check out, try locally and push to management together with docker, xhperf, phpdocumentor, phpunit, etc.
[13:08:54] <Byteflux> I'd argue "most people" are just unaware of xdebug's core debugging features. Setting it up is trivial.
[13:09:25] <biberu> mariorossi111: anyway, once you have a working dev environment i'd learn how to write unit tests, then you can slowly start to add tests for new features, fixed bugs, critical sections etc., you don't have to test everything at once, just a single working test means that you have the framework in place and start to improve
[13:09:27] <teresko> mariorossi111: for docker, I would recommend having your "container environment" set up a sa separte repository
[13:10:49] <mariorossi111> biberu yes next step will probably be unit testing for small legacy functions to get the hang of it, and then try and push for TDD for new code
[13:11:03] <mariorossi111> teresko interesting why as a separate repository?
[13:12:01] <teresko> mariorossi111: as for "how to write tests, this lecture might be useful (it's focued on java, bur works for php code too): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEhu57pih5w

[13:13:20] <Byteflux> There's different schools of thought/approaches on incorporating containers into your development workflow. VSCode devcontainers for example would encourage you to define development containers within the actual project repo.
[13:14:29] <mariorossi111> yes I've noticed a bunch of different paths to follow, I wonder if there's a more prominent standard in project design to follow which covers most cases well (a bit like PHP The Right Way)

[13:16:15] <teresko> you loose the flexibility without knowing that it's been lost
[13:16:38] <Byteflux> That's not a fact, that's an opinion that also seems highly coupled with how you structure your codebase.
[13:19:23] <Byteflux> These are also very broad arguments that aren't making any particular points for counter-argument.

[13:24:49] <teresko> why?
[13:24:50] <Byteflux> Yeah the biggest immediate gain here is that everyone is working from the same dev environment.
[13:24:55] <biberu> ^ that
[13:25:09] <teresko> biberu: doesn't the team already have a development environment set up?
[13:25:16] <biberu> he's saying they don't
[13:25:23] <biberu> they are live editing on production
[13:25:27] <teresko> then they are not developers
[13:25:40] <teresko> serisouly
[13:25:46] <Byteflux> This sort of gatekeeping is a bit old fashioned, everyone starts somewhere.
[13:25:47] <biberu> that doesn't matter
[13:26:09] <teresko> mariorossi111: it might be a good idea to look for a new team in about 6 months :D
[13:26:54] <biberu> teresko: the challenge is finding good goals to improve the current situation, and how to deal with the massive inertia this team probably has, while trying to learn and train them at the same time
[13:27:00] <biberu> so keep it simple for everyone
[13:27:56] <teresko> ok, here is the main argument for standalone doker config: you can set up all of the service and the team members only need to run `docker compose up` to start the server running
[13:27:57] <Byteflux> Even if it starts out as a monolithic container, that's obviously the wrong approach but it would be better than not having a shared dev config at all.
[13:28:17] <teresko> they will be seeing all the logs that way and be able to shut doen the server at will
[13:28:24] <biberu> teresko: you can do that in a single repo too, and it'll be easier
[13:28:36] <teresko> no, you can't
[13:28:39] <Byteflux> Yeah there's nothing stopping you from doing that in a single repo.
[13:28:49] <teresko> because i na single repo setup you will need to teach them about docker
[13:28:53] <teresko> at least the basics
[13:28:59] <biberu> no you don't
[13:29:02] <mariorossi111> teresko i'd rather learn how to be a proper developer, i'm literally here asking for stuff to RTFM about so I'm on the right track.
[13:29:33] <biberu> but in a single repo the code will be available for easy discovery and considering that they just started with git even a clone is probably another threshold
[13:29:57] <biberu> so if you're interested, with a single repo, you could just run docker compose up, or not if you aren't ready
[13:30:00] <teresko> mariorossi111: my point is, that if you hang around here for something like 2 months, you will already be way past your current teams skillset :D
[13:30:02] <Byteflux> You absolutely can do exactly what you just described, within a single repo. Just place a docker-compose.yml at the repo's root.
[13:30:09] <biberu> with several repos there'd be additional steps
[13:30:41] <teresko> "separation of concerns" :P
[13:30:47] <biberu> irrelevant
[13:30:48] <Byteflux> The additional benefit of this is that your docker-compose.yml is versioned alongside your project, which actually makes sense.
[13:30:58] <biberu> yeah, that's a huge plus
[13:35:27] <mariorossi111> teresko aha yeah I'm already at the "boss telling me he has no idea what I'm doing but it works faster so it's ok" stage so i hope in 2 months to reach that point ;)
[13:36:21] <Byteflux> It also helps that PHPStorm and VSCode will recognize the docker-compose.yml in your currently open project and provide ways to run/manage those services/containers.
[13:39:32] <mariorossi111> i'm slowly learning how to appreciate phpstorm precisely because of these nice extras
[13:41:00] <Byteflux> PHPStorm is great, but like all other JetBrains IDEs, suffers from weak support for remote development. JetBrains Gateway is in beta and should make that easier, but it's still not the same experience as VSCode, probably explains why they're making a new IDE from the ground up to compete :P
[13:41:32] <teresko> meh, I just use Atom with phpstan integration - not a fan of fancy IDEs
[13:41:46] <teresko> but that's more of a personal choice
[13:42:15] <Byteflux> I do a lot of Java stuff though and have been a faithful subscriber for years now, paying $15/mo for their "All Products Pack" which is a sweet deal for what you get. They make great IDEs, but now with remote development catching on, I do find myself wanting more.
[13:44:07] <biberu> Byteflux: java eh? can't you just do your remote development with log4j?
[13:44:17] <teresko> mariorossi111: am I correct to assume that you short term goal now is to set up local development environment?
[13:44:27] <Byteflux> biberu: Hahaha, I'm glad I don't do Java *professionally* :D
[13:44:36] <Byteflux> Fortunately my job is PHP
[13:44:52] <teresko> do you already have git-repositories set up for prodution code, mariorossi111 ?
[13:45:31] <teresko> *prodution
[13:45:39] <teresko> *production
[13:45:42] <teresko> damnit
[13:45:46] <mariorossi111> teresko just switched the whole codebase to git, next step i assume i should take is to have 2/3 branches (say dev, testing, production) insteads of working on main
[13:46:04] <Byteflux> biberu: It was hilarious though, watching SWEs bash free software and insult the devs because they dared to release free open source software containing exploits
[13:46:11] <mariorossi111> it's going to take a looong time, but that's what salaried positions are for ;)
[13:46:48] <teresko> mariorossi111: for now I would stick with master + feature branches
[13:46:58] *** Joins: luigibu1 (~luigibu@80.30.201.209)
[13:47:04] <Byteflux> mariorossi111: Close, but you want to take that a bit further. Sharing a branch in Git is a nightmare, which is why you should avoid it as much as possible.
[13:47:16] <Byteflux> That's where feature/topic branches come in.
[13:47:43] <mariorossi111> interesting, i assumed different branches was the accepted standard. noted, thanks to both
[13:47:45] <Byteflux> Ideally one person is working on one particular thing in their own feature/topic branch. Branches are cheap and disposable.
[13:47:51] *** Joins: d[-_-]b (~stenno@user/stenno)
[13:48:17] <Byteflux> Many places will create a new branch for each issue/ticket # for whatever issue tracking system you use.
[13:48:18] <biberu> mariorossi111: there's a lot to consider with branching strategies, especially when it comes to integrating work from different devs / features
[13:48:27] <teresko> where are you hosting your repositories? Am I correct to assume that you ar eusing GitLab or BitBucket free private repos?
[13:48:34] <varrg> Byteflux, as in each employee clone and branch the main repo into their own account?
[13:49:03] <mariorossi111> no it's all local-remote servers, boss wants to go AWS (not a big fan personally, but i'm a 10$ VPS kind of amateur)
[13:49:24] <Byteflux> varrg: Well each developer should of course have their own clone of the repository, yes. Then a developer is also assigned a task/ticket/issue to work on. They should create a new local branch for this task.
[13:49:33] <mariorossi111> biberu do you happen to know where I can learn more about branching strategies?
[13:49:35] <biberu> mariorossi111: i usually have *at least* one branch per ticket, often many, no one else works on those, then i coordinate with the rest of the team about how to share work, preparing for releases etc.
[13:49:37] *** Quits: chao (~stenno@user/stenno) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[13:50:07] <Byteflux> When multiple people are working out of the same branch, things get messy.
[13:50:18] <Byteflux> It's easier to consolidate your individual branches later on
[13:50:19] <teresko> mariorossi111: well, GitLab offers "cloud" for having private repositories hosted. And they also have tools for managing team access and "merge requests"
[13:50:36] <teresko> and those private repos are free
[13:51:05] <teresko> and you can later host GitLab on your private servers - easier for migration
[13:51:12] <biberu> mariorossi111: in general i'd prefer many, short-lived, very focused branches
[13:51:25] <teresko> ^ that
[13:51:29] *** Quits: luigibu1 (~luigibu@80.30.201.209) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[13:51:38] <Byteflux> Agreed with biberu. Branches are very cheap in Git. They should be considered disposable
[13:52:05] <Byteflux> Once your branch is "finished" you can merge it back into master, staging or whatever other more permanent branch
[13:52:09] <Byteflux> Then you can just trash it
[13:52:18] <biberu> mariorossi111: and i'd probably just get familiar with the tool before thinking too much about integration strategies, there isn't really a single best solution for that, it depends on your context
[13:52:46] <mariorossi111> everyone is extremely helpful, thank you very much for shedding light on this
[13:52:57] <varrg> do you sync the local branch every day you work on it? Say you branch to local, and work for a week on it. Meanwhile someone else branch of the same thing and work on it. When you both merge your branches, they will collide right?
[13:52:59] <mariorossi111> i definitely need to experiment first
[13:53:01] <biberu> really *learning* git is well worth the time too
[13:53:14] <biberu> it goes way beyond commit push
[13:53:24] <mariorossi111> at the moment it's BARELY commit push
[13:53:27] <teresko> simplest workflow: hav ode in master branch, new requirement comes, make a feature/requirest-name branch, add code, push the brunch to repo server, create a "merge request" for adding code into master, someone reviews the changes, merge and remove the feature branch .... deploy
[13:53:29] <biberu> :)
[13:53:38] <teresko> *have code
[13:54:03] <biberu> varrg: i rebase personal feature branches on their source as often as possible
[13:54:09] <Byteflux> varrg: In most cases, developers are not directly collaborating, but each developer is individually tasked with ownership of some task or part of a feature they need to complete.
[13:54:18] <Byteflux> So in an ideal scenario, developers aren't sharing branches.
[13:54:35] <varrg> okay
[13:54:43] <biberu> varrg: that source might be master, it might a feature i'm collaborating with someone else on, or something else
[13:54:43] <teresko> Byteflux: exception - long taks, someone takes a vacation
[13:55:05] <teresko> ... or gets fired
[13:55:10] <varrg> interesting. I've never used a versioning system and I thought they magically fixed those things. But I see care still have to be taken and someone should manually review merges
[13:55:12] <Byteflux> If you are tasked with working on a small part of a larger feature, you would still be working out of your own exclusive branch, then when you're done, you can merge your branch into a larger branch or whatever.
[13:55:53] <teresko> there are some "small tasks" that take long time: like design changes
[13:56:23] <teresko> but, yeah, do you not share feature-branches, you inherit them
[13:56:57] <Byteflux> In a very basic (but common) example, developers are usually assigned a ticket to work on. You can create a new branch called "ticket/12345" or whatever the ticket number is, do the work in there, and get your work approved. At which point your branch can be merged back into master.
[13:57:43] <biberu> varrg: there's a lot of nuance to it
[13:57:44] <teresko> and after merge - the "ticket" brunch gets deleted
[13:58:03] <Byteflux> Yeah, the ticket is completed so the branch is no longer needed
[13:58:29] <teresko> varrg: you review changes to catch bugs, not to investigate the versioning :D
[13:58:37] <varrg> I guess having a complete test suite helps with the manual reviewing part
[13:58:45] <mariorossi111> but with short lived branches how do you implement automatic build stuff like code linting? i assumed they had to be implemented in a staging repo and if all is OK code would be moved to master
[13:58:51] <biberu> varrg: one thing i'm doing is e.g. structuring all my commits so that they are easier to review in prs and history
[13:59:22] <teresko> mariorossi111: with "hooks"
[13:59:23] <Byteflux> mariorossi111: That would be part of your CI, you can integrate that behavior in a few different ways, but ultimately it's the job of whatever CI system you're using.
[13:59:29] <teresko> and that ^
[13:59:30] <varrg> biberu, no "Did stuff to code." commits?
[13:59:46] <teresko> there is GitLab CI tool which helps with automation
[13:59:55] <biberu> varrg: lots, but those never end up in shared history
[14:00:11] <varrg> ah, the privacy of your own home
[14:00:30] <biberu> varrg: i can make tons of explorative commits, and once i settled on a solution i'll clean it up and and a proper description
[14:00:41] <Byteflux> mariorossi111: A common approach would be to, as mentioned, use a webhook or something that is notified when a Pull Request (or Merge Request in GitLab) is submitted, then your CI can clone that branch and run any necessary tests/linting etc
[14:01:10] <mariorossi111> noted, will study gitlab and hooks in the weekend, thanks all!
[14:01:19] <teresko> for "first steps" you don't need that :D
[14:01:22] <varrg> biberu, I usually have 8 tabs of 3v4l.com pastes opened. I should learn git
[14:01:58] <biberu> varrg: so e.g. "testing this" -> "now that" -> "also this" -> "oups, undoing that" -> *rebase* -> "ticket-nnn: nice description"
[14:02:05] <Byteflux> You can take this even further and add notifications to your Slack/Mattermost/Discord or whatever communication platform you use :P
[14:03:07] *** Joins: GoldLeader87 (~GoldLeade@sk.connected.by.freedominter.net)
[14:03:30] <teresko> or you could stick with basics and solve the development enviremont problem next, before adding all the bells and whistles to your git setup
[14:03:33] <Byteflux> But yeah, getting way ahead of yourself maybe. Take a more bite sized approach and focus on maximizing efficiency at the lowest cost.
[14:03:44] <biberu> ^
[14:04:02] <biberu> your next step is being able to run it locally for yourself
[14:04:34] <varrg> yeah, git sounds awesome. I've always thought it has been over-the-top for my small personal projects but it would solve a lot of hasslesome tasks I do in most my projects, even if they're small.
[14:04:59] <varrg> never got my thumb out though
[14:05:00] <biberu> varrg: i even use it for regular non-code documents
[14:05:03] <Byteflux> I think there's that moment everyone eventually goes through where Git suddenly just "clicks" and you realize how truly awesome it is.
[14:05:20] <biberu> i pretty much git init anything i do
[14:05:56] <teresko> varrg: git also works vell as "poor man's deploy tool": you just run `git pull` in production and it deploys the latest code ... of course that's not how you do things in 100-developer enterprise project :D
[14:10:36] <biberu> teresko: definite step up from manually adding changes via ftp though ^^
[14:11:01] <teresko> oh, yes
[14:11:09] <teresko> been there, done that :D
[14:11:21] <teresko> ... ike 15 years ago
[14:12:07] <varrg> I've been looking into docker to use before git though. To have different environments for projects. Docker is still the go to solution for that ?
[14:21:59] <teresko> yes
[14:22:28] <teresko> varrg: have you usedvirtual machines?
[14:22:35] <teresko> *used virtual
[14:22:44] <varrg> no, not more than to try another os
[14:23:01] <teresko> ok .. hmm
[14:23:08] <varrg> but I understand it dockers work the same, but share applications
[14:23:11] <varrg> so they aren't duplicated
[14:23:52] <biberu> varrg: the concepts are more important than specific tools
[14:23:56] <teresko> so, the ide behind docker is that each "service" can be set up as a separate container: so you have nginx container and php8 container and php7 container and postgres container
[14:24:05] <teresko> and you can mix'n'match them
[14:25:18] <varrg> so for a wordpress project, I could have 2 containers: wordpress 4 & php7 and wordpress 5 & php8. But I could also have 4 containers: wordpress 4 and wordpress 5, php7 and php8 and then mix and match them?
[14:26:13] <teresko> you wouldn't really need a separate wordpress container - you just need to "mount" the directry, tat containes your wordpress code
[14:26:32] <teresko> I assume that wordpress does not actaully have some background service that it is running
[14:26:48] <varrg> no, that would be the webserver only
[14:27:03] <teresko> you mean, like apache
[14:27:18] <teresko> so there would be apache container, php7 container and mysql container
[14:27:47] <teresko> (I am assumingthat you are using php-fpm
[14:27:53] <varrg> yeah. Currently I use xampp and a wordpress installation, which I update to latest now and awhile. Would be nice to have a better way to test my custom code in different wordpress versions
[14:28:28] <teresko> < no clue about wordpress, I avoid it like a plague :D
[14:28:40] <varrg> yeah, not my go to choice haha
[14:29:08] <varrg> also, I work on 2 different webhosts, would be nice to have local apache containers that match each webhost
[14:29:36] <varrg> so there's no ambiguity when I deploy (read: upload each file over ftp)

[15:37:35] <biberu> mariorossi111: learning how to make legacy code testable and working with it safely is a skill that has to be learned, and you'll probably find that writing testable code affects how you write new things in better ways too
[15:38:46] <mariorossi111> yes i would like to use the opportunity to experiment with testing and then move towards TDD, i've toyed with it when teaching myself go and it felt nice
[15:39:46] <biberu> tdd is a specific way of working with tests, not the only way, and arguably not for every occasion
[15:41:25] *** Quits: Hash (~Hash@hashsecurity.org) (Quit: https://hashsecurity.org)
[15:43:09] <biberu> since you have existing code without tests i'd focus on 1) make testing possible 2) start writing tests myself (this will also help you learn how to write good tests) 3) start running tests automatically 4) show the value of this to the other team members, who might perceive this as a waste of time, 5) ??? 6) ??? 7) ... 99) TDD

[16:51:46] <biberu> teresko: uh, that's an odd collation? don't you know the language of your data?
[16:53:09] <teresko> it's either english or "any", and this works for both
[17:00:29] <Byteflux> "Works" is a loaded term in this context. It supports storing unicode, but that's it. There's more to a collation than "can this character be encoded and decoded"
[17:01:23] <teresko> honestly - have not worked with mysql messin about 8 years :D
[17:01:36] <mariorossi111> is mysql/mariadb that bad?
[17:01:38] <mariorossi111> asking for a friend
[17:02:00] <mariorossi111> (a 15GB, 500+ tables friend)
[17:02:25] <Byteflux> "That" bad? No, not really. It's good for most use cases of relational data.
[17:04:03] <teresko> mariorossi111: postgresql is a lot better, but it is harder to find people who know how to administrate it
[17:04:47] <mariorossi111> i keep hearing the same, i wonder if it would apply to my legacy codebase. worth trying on a small subset i guess
[17:04:54] <teresko> nope
[17:05:09] <teresko> migrating database for a legacy project is a TERRIBLE idea
[17:06:15] <teresko> it is possible to do it, but it requires for people in multiple different roles to know exactly what they are doing
[17:07:20] <mariorossi111> yes it's nicer not to have to make people jump out of planes, but sometimes you have to do it :)
[17:07:35] <Byteflux> Chances are that your *choice* of database software (given Postgres and MySQL) aren't going to be the issue. If your database is an issue, it's more likely going to come down to improper or inefficient database design.

[17:08:57] <mariorossi111> but this is a 5+ years process, the reason why i want to switch things is not to have to rethink things in 2027
[17:09:19] <mariorossi111> indeed, i will try new stuff exclusively with new projects and slowly see how to integrate legacy
[17:09:25] <Byteflux> There's no such thing as future-proofing in an industry that basically reinvents itself once every 5 years.
[17:10:20] <mariorossi111> it's betting, i'm asking around to see which horse is as universally as possible recognized as a safe bet
[17:10:21] <Byteflux> There's always something new or better, tech churn is insane.
[17:11:05] <mariorossi111> no way i'm hoping to get it right, i just want to minimize pain and waste, this ancient code and arch are reaching the breaking point anytime soon and I would like to be smart about it

[17:15:13] <Blondie101010> sounds like you wanted to dig a hole just under your feet
[17:15:48] <binary01> i was using root
[17:15:50] <teresko> mariorossi111: regarding slow quaries - you usually start by fixing the indexes and then look for people doing stupid sub-selects
[17:15:57] <Blondie101010> binary01:  of course :)
[17:16:21] <Blondie101010> binary01:  go see your sysadmin to fix the mess or create you a new super user
[17:16:59] <binary01> ill try that
[17:17:15] <Byteflux> Dropping privileges from the root user seems like a questionable thing to do :P
[17:17:23] <mariorossi111> teresko yes most important stuff is already indexed fortunately, i'm logging queries daily and next year i'll see the results
[17:17:33] <binary01> yes i realize that
[17:17:35] <Blondie101010> never tried it...  maybe it's for the thrill :)
[17:18:10] <Blondie101010> binary01:  do you have good data in that RDBMS?
[17:18:26] <binary01> if i log into mysql on cli i think i have all privileges and i am able to create dbs but that doesnt reflect in phpmyadmin
[17:18:40] <binary01> i did have my db but i have a backup if necessary
[17:18:42] <Blondie101010> also as root?
[17:18:48] <binary01> yes also as root
[17:19:01] <Byteflux> Might be a different root user?
[17:19:11] <Blondie101010> it depends what priviledge you messed I suppose
[17:19:28] <teresko> lemme guess, binary01 , you are ubuntu user
[17:19:29] <binary01> seems like it.. i defently dug myself in a hole
[17:19:30] <Blondie101010> Byteflux:  actually possible with mysql
[17:19:33] <binary01> lol yes
[17:19:51] <Byteflux> Yeah, like say if phpmyadmin is running on a different machine as MySQL
[17:19:52] <teresko> it shows
[17:20:05] <Blondie101010> so use cli to grant the priviledges back to root@'%'
[17:20:49] <binary01> i did grant all on root@localhost. it worked. if i run show grants i see a list but still no privileges in phpmyadmin
[17:20:55] <Byteflux> Something like `grant all on *.* to root@'%'`
[17:21:20] <Blondie101010> binary01:  I did specify @'%'
[17:21:36] <Byteflux> root@'%' and root@localhost are not the same user
[17:23:13] <binary01> i will try that thanks
[17:23:46] <binary01> it says i am not allowed to create a new user with grant
[17:25:40] <binary01> i created user root@% and granted all privileges. still see no privileges in phpmyadmin
[17:26:49] <Byteflux> So that wasn't the issue. If mysql cli works, then seems like a phpmyadmin issue possibly
[17:26:51] <Blondie101010> anyways, refer to your sysadmin or DBA

[22:41:53] <relipse> $uri = basename($uri,'.php').'.js'; <-- this works for blah.php urls but not for directories like foobar.com/mystuff/ which calls index.php , how do I get index.js from a footer file
[22:43:00] <relipse> __FILE__ will not work
[22:43:19] <Naktibalda> if ($basename === '') $basename = 'index';
[22:43:44] <__adrian> i suppose, but that question really sounds like you're doing a lot of things wrong
[22:44:00] <relipse> ...
[22:44:07] <__adrian> file ≠ uri

[22:47:12] <relipse> basename($uri) is returning example.com/foobar/ is returning foobar
[22:47:25] <relipse> so i don't really know if it is index.php or some other php file
[22:48:15] <Naktibalda> well, then you have to check if the last character is '/'
[22:48:16] <__adrian> what's the intent? where are you getting $uri from, and what do you need to use it for?
[22:48:38] <relipse> i have index.php header.php and footer.php
[22:48:53] <relipse> in the footer, i am trying to determine which .js file to load by checkng the file (from the uri)
[22:49:06] <relipse> it normally works fine, but not for index.php
[22:49:34] <__adrian> where are you getting $uri from?
[22:49:41] <relipse> $uri = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];
[22:50:54] <__adrian> so for each "page" (home, contact, etc.) you have a .php file and a matching .js file?
[22:51:15] <relipse> if it exists, yes
[22:51:32] <relipse> if it exists then I script src i t
[22:51:37] <__adrian> i would recommend making a config. e.g.,  $page = "home"; // or whatever
[22:51:47] <__adrian> and then just  use  "{$page}.js"
[22:51:50] <__adrian> and similar
[22:52:39] <__adrian> REQUEST_URI is whatever the user put in the address bar, which might be simply the page name you expect
[22:52:57] <__adrian> might *not

[23:12:37] <relipse> ok thanks
[23:19:06] <teresko> relipse: I have a strong feelsing that you are asking the wrong questions
[23:19:16] <teresko> what exactly is the problem that you are tryingto solve?
[23:20:03] <teresko> because that "index.js" sounds suspicious
[23:28:11] <relipse> page.js not suspicious at all
[23:31:24] <teresko> relipse: what problem are you trying to solve?
[23:31:37] <teresko> we might be able to help you :P
