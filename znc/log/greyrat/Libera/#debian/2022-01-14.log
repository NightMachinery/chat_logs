[08:13:58] <JackFrost> ASDX: Yes!  So you have your choice of tools https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Setup, I use mini-dinstall while a friend uses aptly, reprepro is another great choice.  I'd recommend doing the builds in a chroot using sbuild or pbuilder, then upload to the server.  Of course, if you don't want to do all the work yourself, you *could* utilize the opensuse build service.

[22:47:11] <sverzel> My system is quite old, i.e. was installed ages ago. I've since then forgotten any changes done jumping to testing from stable, but I'm on stable since years. So I'm scratching my head a bit why e.g. firefox-esr is on 91.5.0esr while I'm on Bullseye. Any takes? Old fiddling with testing keeping me extra updated?
[22:50:35] <tomreyn> i read it twice, but i'm still not sure whether you're meaning to be on stable or testing for the main system.
[22:51:02] <sverzel> to be on stable, but some packages are clearly testing, firefox is even on unstable
[22:51:10] <sverzel> guessing I'd need to re-install for a clean system.
[22:51:26] <sverzel> (not that I'm unhappy, but nice to know which versions I'm running)
[22:52:15] <tomreyn> not neccessarily if it's just *some* packages, you could downgrade those. but if it's many, and also because you're saying you've been runnig this system for a long time, a new install may be a good idea.

[23:09:36] <BCMM> sverzel: well, what do you have in your sources.list (and sources.list.d) apart from Debian Stable?
[23:10:20] <BCMM> that's only a mystery if you aren't using this: https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt#PostgreSQL_packages_for_Debian_and_Ubuntu
[23:11:01] <sverzel> BCMM, guess sources.list.d contains pgdg.list with a reference to apt.postgresql.org for stretch-pgdg main. Normal sources.list is bullseye plain.
[23:11:31] <BCMM> you should probably have looked at that when upgrading! (it does say that in the upgrade guide)
[23:11:55] <BCMM> officially, you're supposed to disable unofficial repos for the upgrade. unofficially, you should at least change the keyword
[23:12:06] <sverzel> not a huge headache for me. Thanks for the tip with apt policy. That's usable. Will remove the sources.list.d/pgdp.list.
[23:12:12] <sverzel> BCMM, ah, well, makes sense.
[23:12:29] <BCMM> or, if you do carry on using it, update it to bullseye like you did with your main sources

[23:13:51] <BCMM> sverzel: after disable a repo, you might want to have a look at the output of apt list '~o'
[23:15:09] <BCMM> that's a list of "obsolete" packages, where "obsolete" means the package is installed on your system, but not available in any enabled repositories
[23:15:31] <BCMM> it's good to avoid packages from disabled repos just languishing without updates forever
[23:16:19] <BCMM> (also good to occasionally take stock of things manually installed from .deb files too. in case you've had to install Zoom for example...)
