[15:45:26] <rawtaz> oscurochu: please be more specific. what exact command are you running and where are you running it? presumably the process that creates the files run as root
[15:46:05] <oscurochu> i downloaded this https://github.com/Frojd/Phoenix-Boilerplate and followed the instructions in the README
[15:46:10] <rawtaz> oscurochu: also note that any user you add to the docker group, assuming you run docker as root, are effectively given root permissions on your host
[15:48:17] <rawtaz> oscurochu: this is the Dockerfile that is run and that presumably is the one creating the files: https://github.com/Frojd/Phoenix-Boilerplate/blob/main/src/Dockerfile
[15:48:21] <ikke> root all the users!
[15:48:55] <rawtaz> theres no USER or similar directive in there, which means that unless the parent image (the elixir one) specifies that the stuff in it should run as a non-root user, then by default the processes in the docker container run as root. and thats why the files are created as root.
[15:51:29] <oscurochu> I'm still trying to understand how to work with docker. should my dev server be on docker? or is docker just for production?
[15:52:36] <rawtaz> docker is highly usable for dev as well :)
[15:53:03] <rawtaz> its such a joy to have e.g. a bunch of software and frameworks and servers contianed in one docker compose project, instead of having to install all that cruft on one's machine locally
[15:53:33] <rawtaz> oscurochu: keep having at it. it's not that complex once you get into the basics and start to understand that. make sure you read a couple of intro guides on the net, that might save you some time.
[15:53:37] <rawtaz> so get hte understanding
[15:54:01] <rawtaz> you naturally cant expect to know how it all works just off the bad when following a README, you do need to spend a little time knowing what youre doing
[15:54:04] <rawtaz> and its worth it.
[15:54:12] <oscurochu> so i can edit the files in the docker image without rebuilding the image every time i make a small change?
[15:54:50] <oscurochu> i've followed the hello world docker tutorial
[15:54:51] <rawtaz> you have to be more specific. therese plenty of files
[15:54:57] <rawtaz> ok good
[15:55:16] <oscurochu> well lets say i have an html file.
[15:55:24] <ikke> you can use mounts to mount a local dir in the container
[15:55:32] <ikke> so that files are updated live, when you are developing
[15:55:42] <rawtaz> oscurochu: theres a lot of articles showing how to use docker as a development environment
[15:55:42] <oscurochu> is that what most people do?
[15:55:49] <oscurochu> true. link?

[16:45:55] <oscurochu>  i have an idea
[16:50:30] <oscurochu> well my idea didnt work lol
[16:58:15] <rawtaz> oscurochu: whether you run docker-compose as a non-root user that is part of the docker group in order to be able to run docker commands, or run docker-compose as root, shouldnt make any difference to what the contianer does. all you do when you run docker commands is to tell docker what to do, and it does it the same way regardless who commanded it.
[17:00:51] <oscurochu> well it does make a difference or it would work
[17:01:10] <oscurochu> what do you suggest i do then
[17:01:45] <oscurochu> i just did 'docker rm' on all my containers and tried it again.

[17:06:40] <rawtaz> your docker group user on the host and the user that software inside the container runs as (which is what you configure with that user: thing) are two different things.

[17:23:24] <tabakhase> piwu "needing todo this" is a flowerror in the docker-sense yes... dockers expectation is more "you tell it what you want, and it fails if it cant" - makes a few things a little fugly for sure
[17:25:22] <tabakhase> oscurochu specifically what raw. asked for at timestamp xy:46:33
[17:25:44] <tabakhase> cause "$CURRENT_UID" smells for sure...
[17:25:58] <oscurochu> when i type 'docker-compose exec' and try to do tab completion, the only options are db and web, and i should have a third option called elixir, but i dont.
[17:26:41] <oscurochu> i set $CURRENT_UID using export before i ran docker-compose, which is what this guide said to do
[17:26:54] <tabakhase> were far away from having to worry about tab-completion -- and its prob right so given the container likely failed to start/create as thats the reason you are here or not? ;-)

[17:33:47] <tabakhase> nopaste update - shows elexir logged it, so poke there what that error is, maybe that smells related  https://elixirforum.com/t/hex-version-mix-the-task-phx-new-could-not-be-found/25495  (given we havent seen your dockerfile - and "no clue if your bindmount may overwrite where this was installed) (((think like node_modules folder thats INSIDE ./src/
[17:34:05] <tabakhase> for a first, remove the bindmount, see what it does
[17:34:45] <rawtaz> oscurochu: i'd try this just for kicks; 1) docker-compose down. 2) make sure UID 1000 can write to the ./src dir. 3) delete everything in the ./src dir. 4) docker-compose up. if the same error happens then, i'd have to look more closely at this

[17:39:29] <oscurochu> done. same thing.
[17:39:38] <tabakhase> oscurochu i dont even have a clue what elexir is, but random googling certainly makes it smell like the "node_modules problem" -> "It’s an internal manifest to Hex we write to deps/$DEP/.hex" --- if that means "/app/deps/$DEP/.hex" gets downloaded or whatever during the Dockerfile -- having a bindmount to /app will COMPLETLY hide away everything that was in there on the container side - if 
[17:39:39] <tabakhase> you want to bindmount, you need them on the host too
[17:39:57] <rawtaz> oscurochu: then the project itself is probalby broken and its not a docker issue

[17:40:37] <oscurochu> oops, node_modules made it in there by mistake when i accidentally ran yarn. 
[17:40:45] <rawtaz> so its mix not finding the task you ask it to run (or that the prject asks itself to run)
[17:41:04] <rawtaz> oscurochu: node_modules should not be in there at all, if you did what we asked above and that you said you had already done
[17:41:25] <oscurochu> it was an empty folder
[17:41:32] <rawtaz> *what* was?
[17:41:36] <oscurochu> node_modules
[17:41:59] <rawtaz> it still shouldnt be in there if you deleted everything in ./src OR just removed the volume section.
[17:42:08] <tabakhase> oscurochu "node_modules" doesnt refer to your problem here - but the simple story of "dependencies are UNDER your apps path and get shaddowed if bindmounted" -- be it vendor/ for php, node_modules/ for js, or some egg_* stuff in py :D
[17:42:13] <rawtaz> so either youre not doing what you say youre doing or something extremely odd is happening ;)

[17:48:30] <oscurochu> because you're being rude all of a sudden... like i've done all you told me to. i missed a few small details. but when i brushed back over what i missed, nothing changed. 
[17:48:34] <rawtaz> funny how i can solve this for you and yet you dont want my help lol
[17:48:42] <rawtaz> how have i been rude?
[17:48:56] <rawtaz> oscurochu: for the third or so time - you have several times not done what we asked.
[17:49:02] <oscurochu> like what?
[17:49:07] <rawtaz> several times have we had to ask you more than one time to do something before you did it
[17:49:41] <oscurochu> im donig the best i can. i dont know how to help you help me.
[17:50:39] <rawtaz> for example the config command. you didnt do that until the third request
[17:50:43] <oscurochu> either 1) you dont know docker as well as you think you do 2) this is something to do with elixir/phoenix and the way the mix package manager works
[17:50:59] <rawtaz> i hear you, youre doing what you can
[17:51:23] <rawtaz> oscurochu: ok just out of pure interest - what in what ive told you so far suggests even the slightest to you that i dont know what im talking about?
[17:51:36] <tabakhase> ^^ and thats not even the issue - noone is gonna dig in your nowse to figure out what your problem is - you cant just throw a 40 character errormessage in here while a) ommiting where thats from ((say the servicename from the composer output in the first mix error)) or including "what command you even ran" (and yes, this every time again cause who knows what of the 3 commands weve bene talkn 
[17:51:36] <tabakhase> about was ran) and usually with a nopaste of the full output BEFORE that (its not even clear if you are lookign at some app error still, its a docker error, or even just a compose-error ((likely))

[18:10:57] <tabakhase> mix installs in the homedir?
[18:11:25] <tabakhase> there certainly is a env-var MIX_HOME
[18:12:39] <tabakhase> this could still be a 2split problem a) "not having a homedir at all" (from beeing a random uid-user) is known to break some things, in this case https://github.com/boxboat/fixuid and its readme 
[18:13:19] <tabakhase> b) things were installed in /root/.mix/ - then build as someone else (with all of above issues from the readme to see if --user is stilld oable or not)
[18:13:24] <tabakhase> @ oscurochu
[18:13:30] <oscurochu> im here
[18:15:37] <rawtaz> yeah this has to do with the directory. cuz the entryscript checks for ./mix.exs exisstin and if it doesnt it runs  mix phx.new  which means that if it cant find that file it's in the wrong dir (a dir that doesnt have that task available)
[18:15:40] <tabakhase> seems like you can do smth like "setting MIX_HOME to something useable for everyone" - but id first have a look at whats even set already in your upstream image
[18:16:36] <oscurochu> ugh i wanted to use a boilerplate to avoid all this headache
[18:18:15] <tabakhase> rawtaz the way you say that makes it smell as "/app is empty it runs install" (((similar to the wordpress image entrypoint ya know?)) -- OR is it as i had said initially that thsi "min.exs" is the analog to node_modules and there like and gets made during build?

[18:22:33] <tabakhase> nowhere did anyone say that
[18:22:56] <rawtaz> "min.exs" is the analog to node_modules <- no
[18:23:13] <rawtaz> mix runs stuff such as download deps etc, similar to npm
[18:23:28] <rawtaz> but it can do anything really, similar to webpack and grunt etc
[18:23:53] <tabakhase> and what means "be the analog to something"?.... just a "well known example to illustrate the dependencies inside your bindmount"
[18:24:30] <oscurochu> so would it be easier to just make my own docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile?

[18:26:02] <tabakhase> rawtaz so lets use php composer ./vendor/ instead if that helps :P ;-) -- exact same outcome ;D

[18:39:11] <tabakhase> or maybe line 11? - then https://github.com/wagoodman/dive where it threw what may give some idea - and then either "its gone" cause in app, or chmods.
[18:40:47] <rawtaz> oh nice tool :)
[18:41:14] <rawtaz> im not sure i need to dig around more
[18:41:35] <tabakhase> its super neat - just dum that you need to disable the "unmodiefied" view always when you first start it - otherwise its a little pointless ;D
[18:41:39] <rawtaz> i think im looking in the wrong place. bleh
[18:42:27] <tabakhase> you said you did chmod src right? - find that mix.exs file, either chmod it too, or/and set MIX_HOME (or what it was) to install it outside of /root/ or so
[18:44:55] <rawtaz> yeah ive added a user to the Dockerfile and chmodded the dir but im starting to think the error comes from somewhere else. im sorry but im a bit confused right now and also other things are grabbing my attention so im not getting anywhere for real lol
[18:46:20] <rawtaz> whats interesting is that regardless of running as 1000 or root in the container, they are in /app and both have the same files in an `ls -la` (no mix.exs in there) and their env is in all relevant aspects identical besides root having /root as HOME and the user having /app as HOME.
[18:46:32] <rawtaz> but thats as far as i got now, i have to do other things
[18:46:47] <rawtaz> might poke at it later if you dont dig into it :)
[18:50:07] <tabakhase> rawtaz /app as home would wipe the MIX_HOME again if you then bindmount..  - did you kick the bindmount - or looked at the actual image rather than the container?
[18:51:15] <tabakhase> that is, assumign that MIX_HOME not set makes mix_home=your-home ;D
[18:52:50] <tabakhase> if that all lines up - making a user with /some as home, to then get /some/mix.exs && /app/code.file in at the same time -- and then https://github.com/boxboat/fixuid to make this all modable on boot :)
[18:54:07] <tabakhase> 'modable on boot' can be kinda skiped if you build-arg the ids in, but then that image is only for you, not your coworker or even your notebook.

[19:17:02] <tabakhase> just to close on that, MIX_HOME seems to be ~/.mix ? so yea, random user wont get to /root/.mix/ - install to outside /root may already fix everything ((as the chmod issue is likely on /root not /root/.mix))
[19:19:04] <tabakhase> so, try a single "ENV MIX_HOME=/.mix" under your FROM oscurochu
[19:21:35] <oscurochu>  in docker-compose.yml?
[19:21:56] <tabakhase> also guessing that "./mix.exs missing is correct" - so its correct that the thing runs "mix phx.new" - but to understand that command it needs the modules the dockerfile installed

[19:52:04] <oscurochu> so i think it worked because the commands were still being run by root, because i didnt have the non-root user set. i've started using git to keep track of the different states im testing, so i can be sure my project folder is reset between tests. so once i updated the Dockerfile to have MIX_HOME set and docker-compose.yml to have 1000:1000 for the user, this is what happens https://pastebin.com/tiv8ymra

[20:33:29] <oscurochu> i dont care how it runs things, i just dont want it writing the files as root, because then i have to fix the file permissions later. it makes more sense to have it fixed before it ever has the chance to be written

[20:58:46] <nickjj> did you install docker itself through apt using the instructions on docker's site?
[20:59:28] <oscurochu> yep
[20:59:42] <nickjj> did you ever snap install docker itself in the past?
[20:59:51] <tabakhase> nickjj COPY --chown=node:node ../ ../ isnt rly a thing... not even with buildkit i think - smells more as if that path gets resolved to some junk :D
[21:00:09] <tabakhase> cause going outside the build context is kinda "impossible" :D
[21:00:14] <oscurochu> i just started using ubuntu recently after a long time away from it
[21:00:37] <nickjj> tabakhase, it is a thing -- i'm using this pattern in a bunch of apps
[21:01:07] <nickjj> oscurochu, the only trace i see to that type of error comes back to using snap to install docker based on https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/8121#issuecomment-948721748
[21:01:24] <tabakhase> nickjj only place i find that referenced is "Bug: BuildKit converts path to "absolute"" 
[21:02:00] <nickjj> it's possible the snap version of compose is causing this issue too, i'd try to work through the issue around using curl to install it (i use ubuntu 20.04 on some machines with compose and used both the curl and pip3 installation modes successfully)
[21:02:20] <tabakhase> cause like, this literally shouldnt be able to function ;D - my remote docker-daemon has no clue where my disk is --- heck docker-daemon doesnt even have a clue where my PWD may be at...
[21:03:15] <tabakhase> (as context gets zipped and shipped from cli to daemon, there is no link back to your filesystem like at all...)

[21:08:47] <nickjj> tabakhase, i wonder if build kit is auto-correcting the left side to . silently because both ../ and ./ work for the left side
[21:09:01] <nickjj> the right side is fine to use ../ because it's the destination relative to the WORKDIR in the image
[21:09:32] <oscurochu> so i removed the apt packages, installed the curl one, removed that, installed the snap package, removed that, went back to the apt package... and now it works. wtf-
[21:10:07] <nickjj> oscurochu, haha fun, yeah i don't know what's up with using snap -- personally i try to stay clear of using it
[21:10:24] <oscurochu> me too but it was just somethnig to try
[21:11:07] <tabakhase> nickjj yea right side is fine - and i guess on the left thats the case then yep - should be "COPY --chown=node:node / ../" then to work with everyone i guess =)  (related buildkit issue here https://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/2131 )
[21:11:15] <nickjj> but in the end it upped and you can visit localhost:8000 successfully and all of the files on disk are owned by your local user?
[21:12:06] <nickjj> tabakhase, technically do you mean ./ and not /?
[21:12:16] <tabakhase> both will work / be the same
[21:12:42] <nickjj> the left side of copy is going to copy things from your docker host, that would mean copying from your root directory if you use /
[21:12:58] <tabakhase> should at least ;D - may also be that / opposed to ./ trips it into some funkycase (((cause effectively its in a tempdir obvs.))
[21:13:15] <nickjj> root as in, your system root not the root of your project (where your Dockerfile is)
[21:13:41] <tabakhase> nope, it "literally cant do that, even if it wanted"
[21:14:09] <nickjj> yeah, i mean the left ../ should really be . or ./ if you want to be more explicit

[21:17:53] <nickjj> tabakhase, i just built and: /, ../ and ./ all work - i think / works for the same reason ../ does with build kit maybe fixing it to never go beyond the current directory of the build context
[21:18:37] <tabakhase> but yes, i would/do usually write "COPY . " or "./" --- only case for "COPY / /" is a poor-mans-multistage --squish i guess :D
[21:18:39] <nickjj> but with that said, thanks for bringing this up, i'll update the repo to use ./ because it should have been from the get go and this should in theory fix things so build kit isn't a hard requirement to build the project

[23:21:05] <proph73> Hello
[23:21:05] <proph73> I come to you because I don’t know where else to ask my questions, but feel free to gently tell me where else I could ask. I hope to find some django and docker users here. I often develop websites for my personal use with django. Although, years passing by, my system happens to break. And though I use virtual environments, requirements files for python libraries versions and of course git, a problem remains : to set back the system up
[23:21:05] <proph73>  is really difficult : incompatibilities between python version, django version, database version… I am looking forward to change my way with these things not to have this kind of problems again.
[23:21:05] <proph73> So I was seriously considering using docker. To start projects I generally use a cookiecutterdjango template and happily it comes with a docker configuration file. I am new to docker but in this file I can’t see django and python versions stated... so I tend to think it just uses the last version of each as the stack is set up. But then I would be prone to have the same compatibility problems in the future...
[23:21:05] <proph73> What do you think about it ? What do you use ? What do you advise me ?
