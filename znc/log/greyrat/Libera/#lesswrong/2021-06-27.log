[05:36:16] <gwern> ...imply a degree of dissatisfaction on the part of the customer; in the 1773 edition, Miss Dean exhibited "great indifference" while entertaining her client, busying herself by cracking nuts while he was "acting his joys".

[05:43:24] <Guest5464> interview was nothin. 5 minutes
[05:43:52] <quanticle> saturn2: When I got Nexux (TSA Pre + expedited border crossings between USA and Canada) I had to go to the border to be interviewed by the US and Canadian border officials. The US interview was normal, asking about where I lived, whether I traveled a lot, etc. The Canadian guy asked a few perfunctory questions, one of which was, "So you come to Canada a lot?" I replied, "Yeah, I have friends in
[05:43:54] <quanticle> Vancouver and besides, you can't get ketchup chips in the 'States." He said, "Wait, they don't have ketchup chips down there? Huh," and he stamped my form with his approval.
[05:44:00] <quanticle> *Nexus
[05:44:59] <quanticle> But now I'm annoyed at Canada. I can't renew my Nexus because it has to be done at a US/Canada border crossing and all of those are closed (except for essential functions).

[06:12:04] <adiabatic> I volunteer for the pat-down anyway because I'd rather be touched than exposed to the porno scanners

[06:40:04] <Betawolf> catern: there's convincing someone about reality, convincing someone about morality, and politics.
[06:41:57] <catern> politics is kind of a spice over the other two isn't it? inasmuch as politics means conversations which claim to be about something real, but are actually about status, alliances, etc
[06:42:17] <catern> anyway, the reason I'm asking is, I'm looking for more examples of this pattern:
[06:42:44] <Betawolf> you could convince people about beauty
[06:42:48] <catern> if I have an idea for how something could be improved, the best way to prove my idea is to implement it
[06:42:56] <catern> if I have a prediction, the best way to prove it is to bet on it
[06:43:40] <catern> are there other examples like this? where there's a supreme technique for demonstrating the rightness of a position?
[06:44:42] <Betawolf> A bet doesn't really 'prove' a prediction, unless you're using the old sense of the word.
[06:44:59] <catern> bet on it and then get rich
[06:45:54] <Betawolf> But the bet is just a means of profiting from your prediction being correct, the actual proof is observation.
[06:46:28] <catern> let's not get distracted, even if it doesn't prove the position, it's the right move
[06:46:40] <Betawolf> I guess you're looking for 'put up or shut up' actions.
[06:46:42] <catern> are there other examples of right moves like those two?
[06:46:53] <catern> I suppose so
[06:47:26] <Betawolf> Like, if you think you could beat someone in a fight, you should just fight them. I guess that's just a sub-case of prediction.
[06:48:43] <Betawolf> Or more flippantly, if you're entering any dick-measuring situation... 
[06:49:45] <catern> heh, yeah, "don't threaten, just fight". which I guess is the same kind of thing: costly, putting skin in the game, payoff if you're right
[06:51:54] <catern> my real original thinking was just about ideas for improvements, or research ideas, or ideas for software, though - where IMO the best way to show an idea is good is to just implement it. but that isn't necessarily going to result in a payoff that's greater than the invested effort, so it's not really like a bet...

They had a lot of functionality implemented in a *nix desktop application as far back as 1999: <http://udanax.xanadu.com/green/status.html>.  I think the main problem with Xanadu has always been of organization, perfectionism, and mismanagement.  It seems Ted Nelson just isn't good at running projects.

[11:56:33] <dbohdan> While not Xanadu, an anecdote from the development of ZigZag is illuminating:
[11:56:35] <dbohdan> 'The GZigZag project did not materialize Ted's dream system as fast as he liked, so he withdrew his support. At first it just meant that he wasn't participating in discussions as much as he used to. At some later time he asserted his trademark (he had earlier given his permission to use it), and we changed the name to Gzz. Around the same time I was burning out, partially due to Ted's distrust and a large part due to project internal chemistry 
[11:56:35] <dbohdan> problems. I bailed out on the project in the end of 2002.'  'Some time after my departure from the project, Ted asserted his ZigZag patent. The project was forced to abandon all ZigZag related stuff; it was reformed as Fenfire by salvaging those innovations that were not inseparably linked to ZigZag and using RDF as the new core. I hear that's not the last bit of trouble from outside parties the project has run to, but I cannot discuss even the little 
[11:56:36] <dbohdan> that I know in public. Suffice to say that even Tuomas burned out on the project eventually.'  http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/233

[12:32:43] <feep> holy shit, reading an interview about kde
[12:33:14] <feep> That leaves a gulf between simple use cases (that we can make easy), and complex ones (where it's okay that they remain complicated), which is populated by intermediate-level features. Things like multi-monitor workflows, activities and virtual desktops [.........]; stuff that maybe 10-20% of users use, but it's an important 10-20%, because those people are influencers. 
[12:33:17] <feep> THANK YOU
[12:38:31] <dbohdan> KDE is probably the most power user-friendly DE out of {Gnome, KDE, LXDE, Mate, XFCE}
[12:38:39] <dbohdan> IME it is also the most crashy
[12:38:44] <dbohdan> Obormot\Arcturus: lol
[12:47:23] <dbohdan> What I mean is that KDE is the most capable of being explored and customized through the GUI and offers the most extensive GUI tools for configuring the system it runs on
[12:47:59] <feep> dbohdan: yeah I think crashiness really depends on whether you get lucky with your install
[12:48:07] <feep> since I rebuilt for this gentoo setup, I've had zero crashes
[12:48:15] <feep> but I've definitely had setups where the desktop crashed or hanged daily
[12:49:26] <dbohdan> Then I haven't had much luck with KDE on Ubuntu or openSUSE
[12:49:56] <feep> yeah it's very random
[12:50:04] <feep> the article does highlight crashiness as a problem
[12:50:05] <dbohdan> I remember KDE 2-3 being more stable, though I did less with it

[13:00:37] <dbohdan> Maybe C++ lulls people into a false sense of security?  They start thinking they are working in a high-level language and don't program defensively.  It is less of a problem in C unless you go out of your way to make it look high-level with something like http://libcello.org/.

[13:02:11] <dbohdan> Here is the interview feep quoted, BTW: https://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/interview-kde-team-ng.html
[13:02:23] <feepbot> Dedoimedo interviews: KDE's pointiest stick, Nate Graham (Interview with the KDE QA manager Nate Graham, with questions on the past, present and future of KDE, day-to-day work, Wayland support, Plasma Mobile, collaboration with upstream, community engagement, pointiest sticks and Monty Python refer [snip])
[13:08:26] <dbohdan> 'Top three Linux applications!'  'NG: Non-KDE I presume? In that case, I would say Thunderbird, LibreOffice, and Stellarium. The first are two boringly reliable and useful, and the third is a joy to explore the cosmos with.'  Thunderbird is reliable in the sense it doesn't lose data.  It crashes and monopolizes a CPU core often enough, though.
[13:08:40] <feep> can confirm
[13:08:57] <dbohdan> 'Your favorite Star Trek captain?'  'Janeway, for never giving up and being willing to go to a way more extreme place than anyone else would to keep her crew safe and advance their goals.'  How contrarian
[13:10:19] <mjr> Well Janeway _did_ go all the way into committing cold-blooded murder (to save said crewmembers, or, well, "other" crewmembers)
[13:10:54] <dbohdan> 'If it didn't have to be a FOSS desktop, I would choose macOS. I was a Mac user for decades before entering the FOSS world, and it's still an environment I find comfortable. And Apple's laptops are some of the best in the industry. I'm still waiting for any of the PC vendors to make a laptop that's as good as the M1 MacBook.'  Okay, so my takeaway from this interview is that I should get a Mac
[13:12:47] <dbohdan> 'Name the worst [KDE Plasma feature]'  'NG: The bugginess. We have made great strides here but it's not good enough. Something breaks during every upgrade, and even though we often fix regressions quickly, it's unacceptable that they happen to begin with. What we need is more core Plasma developers who are able to look at issues and fix stuff every day. At this point we get enough bug reports and our QA is pretty good, so the bottleneck is actually 
[13:12:47] <dbohdan> having enough developer time to investigate and fix issues. Everyone is stretched super thin. Even one additional person working on something is a godsend.'

[13:21:00] <mjr> Apropos, I have some nice quotes about Janeway being debriefed at Starfleet upon her safe return, originally from a Finnish FB group discussion:
[13:21:20] <mjr> "And then we joined the Borg's side in a war..." "WHAT?" "Yeah and went into another dimension to blow up the enemies of the Borg!" "No way?" "Yeah, with biological WMD's!"
[13:21:47] <mjr> "Then we gave these Hirogen holodeck tech..." "YOU DIDN'T!" "Yeah seemed like a good idea at the time. We gave some tech to the Borg as well tho."
[13:22:00] <mjr> "In the end I destroyed a timeline so I could help the younger me get home." "DON'T TELL US ANY MORE!"
[13:22:14] <mjr> "And at some point we turned into lizards so I mated with my navigator and layed a bunch of eggs." "REALLY DON'T SAY ANYMORE!" "No worries, we abandoned the egODgs on some random planet!"
[13:22:42] <mjr> My contribution was: "And then there was the time when I personally killed one of my crewmembers." "P-personally?" "The Doctor complained something about doing no harm. At least the others stayed out of my way." "W-were they violent or something?" "No way! He went quietly. Did put up a bit of a fuss earlier when we took him to be executed though. Hey, you've heard of the Trolley Problem, right?"
[13:23:09] <saturn2> wow i stopped watching before most of that. sounds awful
[13:27:21] <mjr> well I mean it's not _all_ that bad and obviously these are made out to look as bad as possible. Well, with some of them it's not hard. The lizard one is that bad.
[13:30:39] <nshepperd2> lizards are used to being abandoned as hatchlings though, so that one wasn't too bad

[22:07:43] <kuudes> what is ethically questionable in speech synt?
[22:08:44] <Betawolf> probably the bit where you don't have to hire voice actors any more
[22:09:06] <kuudes> no one has a duty to employ anyone?
[22:09:24] <Betawolf> I mean, I agree it's dumb, that's just what I predict the issue will be
[22:09:55] <kuudes> we should make the government to have actually tedious but clearly redundant jobs
[22:10:16] <kuudes> something like where one team drags colored tokens to one place and another back to the original point

[22:12:43] <Betawolf> oh, I see, it's that plus also you can use speech synth to reuse an actor's voice without paying or consulting them

[22:17:24] <kuudes> but in usa things are different
[22:17:50] <feep> there's a funner question there
[22:17:53] <Betawolf> of course, there are many actors quoted to reassure us that actors are irreplaceable conduits to the truth of human experience
[22:18:00] <feep> do voice imitators, like, human imitators, violate copyright
[22:19:00] <kuudes> some of them would be protected as parody, as that is a separate right
[22:19:13] <gwern> we don't know. it's very unsettled law. you almost certainly violate trademark/personality rights if you advertise your NN as generating 'X' (this is where 15.ai is on very shaky ground), but the legal discussion seems to be that probably voices themselves cannot be copyrighted
[22:19:29] <kuudes> which is sort of weird - it is specifically allowed to copy a copyright work in order to insult or criticize said work
[22:19:43] <kuudes> where otherwise such copying might not otherwise be allowed
[22:19:54] <gwern> (there's never been enough demand for human voice imitators or voice-overing or voice-acting, separate from a specific personality, for any real caselaw, apparently)
[22:20:01] <dbohdan> The most relevant bits from the post are, 'In the US voice actors have been confirmed to have certain rights in their works. In Midler v Ford Motor Co., the singer and voice-actor Bette Midler asserted her rights in her voice, which was imitated in an advert by Ford. Although the Court of Appeal stated that "…A voice is not copyrightable. The sounds are not 'fixed'", they did afford her rights under common law for appropriation of identity. The
[22:20:01] <dbohdan> y highlighted that "…[a] voice is as distinctive and personal as a face. The human voice is one of the most palpable ways identity is manifested".' and ' Similarly in Waits v Frito-Lay Inc., the US Court of Appeal determined that a radio commercial that imitated the voice of Tom Waits, a famous singer with a very unique voice, amounted to appropriation of publicity rights under California law and false, implied endorsement under federal law.'
[22:20:14] <gwern> kuudes: well, you are still violating copyright. what parody gets you is a legal defense so the court won't throw you in jail
[22:20:22] <kuudes> oh
[22:20:40] <gwern> 'the court finds you totally violated copyright, but we'll overlook it this time'
[22:21:01] <kuudes> personally I think we should just get rid of accepting us copyright on europe, but meh
[22:21:33] <kuudes> over here only works of art can be have a copyright, whereas in usa it is laxer afaik
[22:21:58] <gwern> dbohdan: yes, that's what I'm referring to. I suspect that one reason that nothing like hasbro suing 15.ai has happened in part because the stakes are so low independent of the personality/endorsement stuff, and because they're worried about setting a bad precedent

[22:22:46] <two2thehead> I love well written articles <3
[22:22:52] <gwern> the thing is, voices themselves are of pretty low value. they have value mostly in conjunction with a specific name, personality, franchise, IP etc. and *that* gets you most of what copyright owners want and need
[22:23:30] <gwern> the voice of twilight sparkle is just a contemporary american girl voice, overly heavy on vocal fry etc. it is valuable as the voice of *twilight sparkle*
[22:23:52] <dbohdan> gwern: Very good point about precedent.  I didn't consider it.  (And Hasbro is unusually lenient about fanworks in general, isn't it?)
[22:24:31] <gwern> dbohdan: relatively, I guess. but 15.ai is being superblatant about it and it treads far closer to 'substituing for official hasbro products' than many things and users of 15.ai monetizing it

[22:28:23] <gwern> so, the obvious long-term equilibrium is to not even bother with human voice-actors from the start. your creative director will just do search over random voices from some NN library - it's a very 'I know it when I hear it' sort of thing. You don't have a human voice gerrault, you just write his lines, review his character profile and the director's instructions about how Gerrault should...
[22:28:29] <gwern> ...'vibe', and sit through batches of dozens of samples until you decide *that* is how gerrault sounds
[22:28:53] <gwern> it's only an issue for legacy IP, and you can handle those by simply adding a clause to the contract for the next bit of work
[22:29:05] <two2thehead> hmm
[22:29:29] <kuudes> indeed
[22:29:50] <two2thehead> Honestly, I'll just be happy when modders dont' have to rely on DIY/amateur voice acting provided by fans
[22:30:10] <two2thehead> They mean well, but the variance is W I D E and skewed down
[22:30:16] <gwern> no human voice actor involved, the selection is work for hire and can always be revisited, and the imitators don't matter because the voice itself is worthless and it has value only as part of the IP complex and that provides tons of ways to smack down any abuse
[22:30:38] <gwern> it's sort of like how disney isn't worried about stuff falling into the public domain anymore

[22:35:07] <dbohdan> True
[22:35:30] <gwern> or how every type designer shits out a helvetica clone
[22:35:32] <dbohdan> Perhaps the voices will be impossible yet samey

[22:39:24] <two2thehead> TIL that there is a change.org petition to NOT allow Jeff Bezos to return to earth after he goes to space :-/
[22:39:36] <gwern> at a guess, it'll increase the range, but narrow the variance. auteurs and indies etc *will* exploit the full possibilities of vocaloid and glados and beyond, but then everyone else will make tiny variations on morgan freeman etc
[22:40:14] <gwern> because they'll be able to optimize for the exact familiar unrisky bland mediocrity they want, without the natural variation of the voice actors showing up for auditions to shake them out of it
[22:40:32] <ggreer> Sachio inclined his head briefly, fingertips to forehead, downloading information from the polis library. “Do you have any idea what archetypal narratives are?”
[22:40:32] <ggreer> “Messages from the gods, or from the depths of the soul; who can say? But they encode the most profound and mysterious — ”
[22:40:32] <ggreer> Sachio cut him off impatiently. “They’re the product of a few chance attractors in flesher neurophysiology. Whenever a more complex or subtle story was disseminated through an oral culture, it would eventually degenerate into an archetypal narrative. Once writing was invented, they were only ever created deliberately by fleshers who failed to understand what they were. If all of antiquity’s greatest statues had been dropped into a 
[22:40:32] <ggreer> glacier, they would have been reduced to a predictable spectrum of spheroidal pebbles by now; that does not make the spheroidal pebble the pinnacle of the artform. What you’ve created is not only devoid of truth, it’s devoid of aesthetic merit.”

[22:41:29] <Robomot> Complete Text — Greg Egan (The Planck Dive by Greg Egan)
[22:42:56] <ggreer> Turns out Egan isn’t cynical enough. People deliberately make these things *because* they understand what they are and they want to make money and/or be popular
[22:45:30] <gwern> (this is more or less how I see things like the MCU. applying ever more enormous investments and R&D to optimize for mediocrity. but that's sad only if you care too much about the mainstream. there's never been more alternatives)
[22:45:32] <dbohdan> two2thehead: "Get your ass to Mars!"
[22:45:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Interesting...
[22:45:53] <two2thehead> something something unintended consequences :V
[22:46:05] <ggreer> yeah the cost to make media has been going down such that there is more niche stuff now than ever before
[22:46:28] <gwern> like beauty. the possibilities have never been greater, nor the range wider
[22:47:09] <gwern> it occurred to me that this is probably true on the low end too - probably the ugliest people to ever live, live now. not just because of population size, but because of medicine and trauma medicine especially. a century ago, someone burned 100% over would just plain die on the spot.
[22:47:49] <gwern> cosmetic surgery has gotten good, but I don't know if it has gotten good enough to defeat that
[22:48:42] <ggreer> hmm... hard to say. certain ugliness things are totally solvable with current technology. eg: goiter
[22:48:53] <gwern> those aren't particularly extreme, though
[22:48:54] <ggreer> or any sort of benign tumor, no matter how big
[22:49:17] <gwern> think someone's face just melted off by a fire. or bitten off by a chimpanzee
[22:49:43] <two2thehead> what ggreer said
[22:50:29] <ggreer> yeah, full body burns are insanely fatal without modern medicine, so nobody burned lived before the 20th century
[22:50:36] <two2thehead> how about 'technology has lead to a lot of uglier people, BUT the possibility of them making themselves look good/or at least not hideous, is higher than it has ever been in modern history'
[22:50:47] <two2thehead> think make up in addition to plastic surgery
[22:50:59] <ggreer> but chimp guy might have lived in the past. my guess is that uglier people are around today because we don't mercy kill anymore
[22:51:14] <ggreer> *a lot of uglier people

[22:54:48] <two2thehead> true

[22:57:32] <ggreer> fun fact: the 500th anniversary of cortez's destruction of the aztec empire is september 1st 2021. this is also when new zealand celebrates random acts of kindness day

[23:07:55] <two2thehead> yep

[23:10:57] <ggreer> travis points this out in one part of the book and says he expects that one day his little kubota tractor will be able to automatically plow his driveway
[23:12:25] <two2thehead> soon.tiff
[23:13:49] <ggreer> the biggest issue seems to be engines. combustion engines wear out as part of their operation. that means generators, tractors, chainsaws, 4-wheelers, etc... all of them need constant maintenance and repair
[23:14:01] <ggreer> also they need fuel which you have to get from gas stations
[23:14:42] <two2thehead> yeah, but on the plus side, the industry seems to be moving towards electric motors
[23:15:38] <two2thehead> My prerequisites may be different from Travis's. I'm just happy if I can have a 5 square KM area where I can live for one year. I based it off of surviving a zombie apocalypse
[23:16:07] <ggreer> electric motors last much longer. lithium batteries degrade, but they do so gradually and can be replaced after a decade or so (hopefully with better batteries)

[23:16:16] <Robomot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[23:18:52] <ggreer> oh. also he calculates the odds of various bad things happening during your lifetime. eg: layoffs or recessions happen approximately once every 5 years, over your life you have a >99% chance of losing your job. plagues happen once every 100 years, so you have a ~50% chance of enduring a plague (he wrote this in 2019)
[23:19:21] <kuudes> that seems optimistic :->
[23:19:28] <ggreer> chance of a household robbery is something like 80%. chance you'll live through a civilizational collapse is around 5%
[23:20:03] <ggreer> anyway, he uses those odds to help you figure out your level of preparedness to each. maybe you want to prepare for a robbery but not the collapse of civilization
[23:21:19] <mst> ah, good, nice to see the cult of morlock spreading
[23:22:59] <ggreer> it's funny to see the list of bad things and check off a bunch of them. recession/layoff? yep. multi-day power outage? yep. household robbery? yep. world war? nope. plague? yep
[23:24:02] <two2thehead> the power outage thing has pretty much been negated imo.
