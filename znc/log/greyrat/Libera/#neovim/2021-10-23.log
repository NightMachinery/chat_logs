[00:01:05] <spiderman> very cool program you got here. has Bram come out and made a statement about neovim?
[00:01:15] <spiderman> neovim is eating his lunch
[00:04:23] <bfredl> <dmitmel[m]> "also... bfredl, I have found..." <- Cool, you could turn it into a proper plugin or something :) 
[00:04:56] <clason[m]> > <@dmitmel:matrix.org> yes, this is why I was asking. although at least measuring the difference in my case may be worth it because I have a few helper functions, in particular this beauty for doing computer graphics in Vimscript:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/100134c0f073e55a01c1283c7fd2a4b661e080df)
[00:05:09] <dmitmel[m]> bfredl: yes I thought about it, but I don't have the capacity right now to maintain neovim plugins 😅
[00:05:19] <clason[m]> But, yes, once you start doing non-trivial actual computation, Lua will pull ahead
[00:05:27] <bfredl> spiderman: No need to worry there is plenty of lunch around
[00:05:50] <clason[m]> You could look at colorbuddy and lush -- which are both in Lua and doing exactly the sort of thing you describe
[00:06:20] <clason[m]> > very cool program you got here
[00:06:20] <clason[m]> "Shame if anything happened to it."
[00:06:26] <dmitmel[m]> clason[m]: I actually want my colorscheme to work in regular Vim too
[00:06:52] <clason[m]> well, then you can't have it in Lua :)
[00:06:58] <dmitmel[m]> why not? if_lua
[00:07:06] <spiderman> bfredl: yes, but as vim/neovim diverge, drift further apart, people are going to start committing to one or the other
[00:07:11] <clason[m]> I don't think that works for colorschemes
[00:07:14] <spiderman> sounds like neovim is the future of vim
[00:07:16] <clason[m]> I don't know, though.
[00:07:29] <clason[m]> No, Helix is the future
[00:07:30] <dmitmel[m]> a colorscheme does not need to do much other than to eval Vimscript code and maybe read some configuration variables
[00:07:56] <clason[m]> (move along; nothing to see here)
[00:08:33] <clason[m]> dmitmel[m]: It's a question of how the plumbing is set up. In Neovim, you can do `:colorscheme foo` and load `foo.lua`
[00:09:09] <dmitmel[m]> " colors/foo.vim
[00:09:09] <dmitmel[m]> luafile <sfile>:p:h/foo.lua

[00:12:50] <clason[m]> Gonna have to disagree there (keywords being "automatically" and "everything").
[00:12:55] <Bowuigi[m]> Not a sauce, but if you port VimScript to Lua it will be faster
[00:13:00] <clason[m]> No
[00:13:14] <clason[m]> Sorry, that's just not true.
[00:13:29] <Bowuigi[m]> Bowuigi[m]: Usually* faster

[00:14:04] <dundargoc[m]> Helix is the future only because clason is giving them free advertisement
[00:14:11] <Bowuigi[m]> clason[m]: Is Vimscript compiled to bytecode or interpreted in-place?
[00:14:20] <Bowuigi[m]> Never looked that up lol
[00:14:23] <clason[m]> No, Helix is the future because oberblastmeister is contributing to it

[00:15:40] * spiderman doesn't know which commit we are talking about

[00:16:38] <mjlbach[m]> dmitmel I'm fine fixing it, I just need some test cases where it fails

[00:17:37] <dmitmel[m]> https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14542
[00:18:14] <Bowuigi[m]> clason[m]: So the thing that is making it slower is actually Neovim?
[00:18:17] <Bowuigi[m]> Hmmm
[00:18:28] <dmitmel[m]> also this can be renamed to something more meaningful as the issue is clearly not in json_encode giving up on non-UTF8 strings
[00:18:31] <clason[m]> I never said that Lua is slower
[00:18:41] <clason[m]> I just said that "Lua is faster" is a meaningless claim.
[00:18:55] <Bowuigi[m]> clason[m]: I guess
[00:19:11] <Bowuigi[m]> I didn't move to Lua for the speed anyway
[00:19:18] <clason[m]> Which is fine.
[00:20:19] <clason[m]> and the reason `init.lua` is a thing -- so people who prefer to write Lua can use it in more places

[01:26:04] <mjlbach[m]> I mean, if you're working on a file under subfolder A, and you open subfolder B, do you add to the server launched in subfolder A or do you launch a new folder for subfolder B

[01:27:25] <dmitmelDmytroMel> I don't have a better answer than "it depends"
[01:27:56] <mjlbach[m]> Yes, so the "depends" mechanism is what I've introduced in the lspconfig rewrite :) 
[01:28:26] <mjlbach[m]> we support workspace folders fine in core, it's just lspconfig assumes single root workspaces, and launches a new server per workspace 
[01:28:32] <dmitmelDmytroMel> wait, have you actually started working on it or is in just on paper?
[01:29:00] <dmitmelDmytroMel> by "paper" I mean https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/issues/1221
[01:29:04] <mjlbach[m]> I started working on it a month ago, but then put it aside because I want to do many things that will be substantially easier with the lua autocommand api
[01:29:18] <mjlbach[m]> I guess a month and a half ago
[01:29:29] <dmitmel[m]> test test test
[01:29:40] <dmitmel[m]> ah finally, Matrix seems to work again

[01:30:10] <mjlbach[m]> but I have a skeleton that does declarative projects now
[01:30:35] <mjlbach[m]> the search precedence by default is:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/6cda0d69717fda575f02ed6b1edf83db1f237ee2)
[01:30:55] <mjlbach[m]> the top 3 can includes mutliple workspace folders, so entering any of the workspace folders is the trigger for starting the project
[01:30:58] <mjlbach[m]> s/mutliple/multiple/
[01:31:21] <dmitmel[m]> I see
[01:31:44] <dmitmel[m]> I wish I could share my thing, but it's WIP because the entire config is WIP
[01:32:19] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah, this is a longer term thing, as I'd like to move it into core
[01:32:39] <dmitmel[m]> Nice
[01:33:03] <mjlbach[m]> and then lspconfig will be like a "filetype" plugin bundler, similar to how we have filetype plugins, just a bag of configs people can install in case there isn't a dedicated plugin, or writing a plugin would be ridiculous because the server is entirely on spec
[01:33:50] <mjlbach[m]> like writing a dedicated pyright extension would be kinda silly, because it has 1 off-spec request to implement, but writing one for RA makes a ton of sense because they implement many custom requests which need to be handled

[01:36:47] <mjlbach[m]> Ok, so my understanding of the problems in incremental sync are that 
[01:36:47] <mjlbach[m]> * extract text is receiving start/end byte ranges, which means it's sending nonsense in the event that the bytes are the same for the first char of a multibyte character but the others have changed
[01:36:47] <mjlbach[m]> * compute length is computing the byte length (gain, wrong), and adj_end_char is operating on the bytes when it should be operating on the utf-8/16/32 position
[01:36:52] <mjlbach[m]>  * Ok, so my understanding of the problems in incremental sync are that
[01:36:52] <mjlbach[m]> - extract text is receiving start/end byte ranges, which means it's sending nonsense in the event that the bytes are the same for the first char of a multibyte character but the others have changed

[01:37:05] <dmitmel[m]> yes
[01:37:14] <dmitmel[m]> that was my conclusion as well
[01:38:19] <mjlbach[m]> Cool cool, yeah we'll get this out before 0.6 at the latest, I don't know if/when there will be a 0.5.2
[01:38:41] <mjlbach[m]> starting at unicode too long gives me a headache but I'll try to work on it a bit today :) 
[01:39:04] <mjlbach[m]> btw we are replacing this all with on_bytes... eventually
[01:39:04] <mjlbach[m]> will remove all the hacky diffing code
[01:40:24] <dundargoc[m]> mjlbach[m]: What part of 💩🧐🤯🇮🇹 do you not understand?
[01:40:52] <dmitmel[m]> by the way, I wanted to ask you something. in my configs I have a lot of code which goes like this:
[01:40:54] * dmitmel[m] sent a lua code block: https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/7ec89aa018dd65ea41e8e0dedd2854925a1d12bd
[01:40:57] <mjlbach[m]> I only see [A-Z][1-9][!-0]
[01:42:28] <dmitmel[m]> essentially monkey-patching functions from the core LSP implementations with basically customizations or bugfixes. is this an expected way of customizing that stuff? i.e. exploiting the dynamicness of Lua to replace parts of the public implementation
[01:42:42] <mjlbach[m]> Well
[01:42:55] <mjlbach[m]> you should never locally patch bugs, because there should be tickets and they will be fixed
[01:43:00] <mjlbach[m]> but yes
[01:43:03] <dundargoc[m]> I know utf is the cause of many headaches but emojis are the best inventions since computers.
[01:43:07] <dmitmel[m]> I don't want to sit on nightly
[01:43:10] <mjlbach[m]> the way for deep customization is override driven 
[01:43:12] <dundargoc[m]> sorry not sorry
[01:43:37] <mjlbach[m]> we only add additional opts when we see a ton of people doing the same overrides, vim.diagnostic has a lot more options built in than vim.lsp.diagnostic did
[01:43:38] <dmitmel[m]> mjlbach[m]: well, I plan to eventually submit the stuff that I found
[01:44:08] <mjlbach[m]> going forward the release cadence should be faster than 0.4.4 - 0.5
[01:44:15] <mjlbach[m]> so 0.6 is soon
[01:44:34] <mjlbach[m]> but I would like to sort the various utf/multibyte bugs out in the built-in client before then
[01:44:51] <mjlbach[m]> there's also a fun one where deleting carriage returns completely breaks incremental sync
[01:48:38] <dundargoc[m]> Oh yeah. You mentioned you discussed with Björn on how to tackle it?
[01:48:56] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah, there are many options, only 1 is the good option and it's the most complicated
[01:50:01] <dundargoc[m]> F
[01:52:34] <dundargoc[m]> I take it incremental sync as in treesitter? That's...sounds kinda serious in that case since the whole point of it is that it's supposed to be incremental if I recall correctly.
[01:52:56] <dundargoc[m]> s/'s//
[01:55:00] <dundargoc[m]> Maybe
[01:57:59] <dundargoc[m]> Anyway, I can provide moral support in the form of subpar tiktoks whenever you feel you need that little extra boost 🥰

[10:25:14] <euoiaJamesPickar> getting an error "module 'cmp' not found" - what is it that is supposed to provide the cmp module?
[10:25:24] <mjlbach[m]> you need to install it via packer
[10:25:27] <mjlbach[m]> or your plugin manager
[10:25:43] <euoiaJamesPickar> it's installed via Packer
[10:25:44] <mjlbach[m]> https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/blob/1a77d318794193ffe65ad7d3b955575dc6e62ef9/init.lua#L38-L41
[10:27:07] <euoiaJamesPickar> I have 	use({ "hrsh7th/nvim-cmp", setup = [[require('config.nvim-cmp')]], requires = "hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp" })
[10:27:11] <euoiaJamesPickar> s/I have 	use({ "hrsh7th/nvim-cmp", setup = [[require('config.nvim-cmp')]], requires = "hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp" })/I have `use({ "hrsh7th/nvim-cmp", setup = [[require('config.nvim-cmp')]], requires = "hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp" })`/
[10:27:36] <euoiaJamesPickar> ah I need to use `config` not `setupz
[10:27:37] <euoiaJamesPickar> s/setupz/setup`/
[10:30:41] <euoiaJamesPickar> Ok, it's working
[10:30:43] <euoiaJamesPickar> Thanks
[10:32:36] <mjlbach[m]> np, should be mostly an upgrade :) 
[10:32:43] <euoiaJamesPickar> One thing that I'm trying to figure out is how to manage the dependency between things like nvim-cmp and the lsp configuration
[10:32:59] <euoiaJamesPickar> Kickstart has it all in one file, which I guess is one way
[10:33:00] <mjlbach[m]> hm?
[10:33:32] <euoiaJamesPickar> so cmp_nvim_lsp does something with the lsp capabilities
[10:33:45] <euoiaJamesPickar> such that there's a dependency there
[10:34:01] <euoiaJamesPickar> presently, I have configuration for each plugin in a separate file
[10:34:45] <euoiaJamesPickar> but I guess I will have to reference cmp_nvim_lsp in my lspconfig.lua file
[10:36:42] <euoiaJamesPickar> which is fine,  it just means I need to make a note of the dependency
[10:37:23] <euoiaJamesPickar> one of the things I'm trying to do with my updated vim configuration is have a better sense of the dependencies between things, so that when I remove or change a plugin I can make sure all references to it are removed or changed
[10:37:27] <mjlbach[m]> There shouldn't be any dependencies
[10:37:43] <mjlbach[m]> cmp and lspconfig should be independent 
[10:39:45] <euoiaJamesPickar> well, not really, because when you run lspconfig[%language_server%].setup you need to pass in capabilities which come from `require('cmp_nvim_lsp').update_capabilities(capabilities)`
[10:39:48] <euoiaJamesPickar> so there is a relationship there
[10:40:11] <mjlbach[m]> Oh, that's not really a dependency though, you can set those same options without cmp
[10:40:17] <mjlbach[m]> it's just a table deep_extend

I find it kind of annoying to set border options in 5 or 6 places through my config. My reasoning is that if you're using borders for one floating window, you would probably want to use borders for all of them.

[16:56:55] <bobdobbs> one of the values in that list is 'home/bob/.config/nvim'. If I clone scripts into their, should I expect them to autoload?

[16:59:30] <bobdobbs> I'm not seeing a subdir with 'plugin' in the path. If I add a 'plugin' subdir manually in the '.config/nvim' subdir, would my downloaded script then be autoloaded?
[17:01:11] <bfredl> what do you mean with "script"
[17:01:14] <clason[m]> yes, you need to create the directories manually
[17:01:31] <bfredl> if it is a plugin repo you want it in `.config/.nvim/start/therepo`

[17:04:39] <bfredl> at some point you might want to consider a package manager instead
[17:04:54] <bfredl> like https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim
[17:05:16] <bobdobbs> Yeah, the readme says to use a package manager... but that basically takes me to square one anyway... the problem of installing a package

[17:10:54] <clason[m]> (unsurprisingly)
[17:11:20] <clason[m]> point of terminology, to avoid getting confused:
[17:11:33] <clason[m]> "vimscript extensions" (like NerdTree) are referred to as "plugins"
[17:11:56] <clason[m]> these can be installed as vim "packages" (which packer.nvim does)
[17:12:08] <bobdobbs> ah, ok
[17:12:20] <clason[m]> (just in case it comes up)
[17:13:05] <bobdobbs> If I'm reading the readme right... once I've installed packer I then write configs to install packages. Is that right?
[17:13:14] <clason[m]> that is correct
[17:13:38] <clason[m]> (and then tell Packer to install/update those)
[17:14:08] <clason[m]> look at https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim, which is a good starting point for your own configuration
[17:14:35] <bobdobbs> That's probably a little more complexity than I want to take on tbh. I think I'll take another look at vim-plug
[17:14:40] <clason[m]> it even includes a bit at the top that installs packer for you if it is not installed already

[19:40:41] <dundargoc[m]> Essentially, I was asking about if any arch users knew where pacman files for lua-language-servers are stored.
[19:40:47] <clason[m]> Ah.
[19:40:54] <dundargoc[m]> Ok for that one I did 0 research, so it's on me.

[20:21:14] <Famiu[m]> what's the time complexity of `vim.str_utfpos`
[20:23:14] <mjlbach[m]> I have no idea, it calls ptr2len_len at each codepoint, so I'd guess O(n)
[20:23:26] <Famiu[m]> I see
[20:23:30] <mjlbach[m]> the table insertion into the lua table is probably more of a bottleneck
[20:23:48] <mjlbach[m]> and it's not used in a hotpoint anywhere except potentially the incremental sync algorithm which is already pretty fast
[20:23:58] <Famiu[m]> I wonder if there's a way to iterate through unicode characters in a string with O(n) complexity using Lua in Neovim
[20:24:23] <dundargoc[m]> Ngl, the tea was lukewarm
[20:24:24] <Famiu[m]> Famiu[m]: Cause if `vim.str_utfpos` is O(n), then using it would make it O(n²)

[20:24:37] <Famiu[m]>  * Cause if `vim.str_utfpos` is O(n), then using it would make it O(n²)
[20:24:50] <Famiu[m]> Since you'd have to use it multiple times for each unicode character
[20:24:54] <mjlbach[m]> No
[20:24:59] <mjlbach[m]> You cache it once per line
[20:25:09] <mjlbach[m]> it returns an array

[20:25:24] <mjlbach[m]> yes
[20:25:40] <Famiu[m]> ohh
[20:25:51] <Famiu[m]> I confused it with utfindex
[20:25:55] <mjlbach[m]> If you read the return value annotation I added, it says `Returns one value: a list of codepoints.`
[20:25:55] <Famiu[m]> s/utfindex/`str_utfindex`/
[20:26:28] <clason[m]> Maybe `Returns a list of codepoints` would be clearer?
[20:27:20] <mjlbach[m]> I just matched the documentation style of other functions in that area
[20:28:05] <clason[m]> Ah, I see. Never mind then.
[20:28:57] <clason[m]> (although I've only seen it with "returns **two** values"...)
[20:29:45] <clason[m]> `str_byteindex` just (helpfully) says "Returns the byte index"
[20:31:04] <bfredl> We support both UTF-16 and UTF-32 (country _and_ western)
