[00:01:53] <greycat> What does "the value of each file" mean here?
[00:01:53] <kurahaupo> wizhurd: a pipe connecting two commands takes the output of the first one and feeds it as the input of the second one. Commands like echo or mkdir don't read 'input'

[00:04:37] <greycat> Or even:  echo *   (but this has caveats)
[00:04:41] <kurahaupo> wizhurd: you need to write a loop to run a few commands for each file.
[00:05:15] <wizhurd> kurahaupo: yes

[00:05:53] <kurahaupo> wizhurd: Neither cat nor echo will be useful

[00:09:11] <kurahaupo> yeah, though when they aren't clear on the distinction between a file name and a file's contents, I figure the extra clarity wouldn't hurt
[00:11:02] <wizhurd> when you said mkdir and echo couldn't access the filename was it because only it's content is passed through the pipe when doing cat?
[00:11:23] <kurahaupo> for filename in * ; do stuff here using $filename ; done # bold words are keywords that you don't change. blue word you can choose. Orange is where you put the list of files, or a pattern that will match them
[00:11:29] <greycat> It's because piping to them makes no sense.

[02:01:59] <earnestly> How does it handle --foo=bar --baz where -foo takes an optional argument, why wouldn't --foo --bar just look like --foo=--bar ?
[02:02:00] <cryptonector> optional... good question -- if you declare a long option as needing an argument, then it's required
[02:02:27] <earnestly> getopts_long has optional options, and it is pretty insane imo
[02:02:40] <cryptonector> so if you say --foo requires an argument and you say --foo --bar, then --bar is the OPTARG for --foo

[02:05:27] <cryptonector> eek
[02:05:43] <cryptonector> yes, I see that
[02:06:18] <cryptonector> I guess what I would be willing to do is to say that if you want an optional option argument, then you must use --long[=arg]
[02:06:24] <cryptonector> I'd be happy to implement that
[02:06:58] <cryptonector> I don't want to implement logic that says the first thing after --whatever-long is the optional arg unless it starts with -, because that's just nuts
[02:06:58] <earnestly> When it comes to option parsing I think the two reasonable ones are getopts (plan9 implementation is ridiculously simple: https://0x0.st/zltK.c ) and Google's options, which are basically just -words
[02:07:16] <cryptonector> oh there are alternatives
[02:07:26] <cryptonector> Heimdal has a getarg() thing
[02:07:30] <cryptonector> it works well enough
[02:07:55] <earnestly> Because -words can be maintainable, getopt_long tries to support both the terse short opts and -words but the result is silly complexity
[02:07:55] <cryptonector> it will even generate stub man pages
[02:08:16] <cryptonector> right, you have to stop the madness somewhere
[02:08:16] <earnestly> (Like curl's author, I do think man pages have to be written, not generated)
[02:08:44] <cryptonector> of course; the stub it generates is just useful as a starting point
[02:08:51] <cryptonector> you have to do the rest, and it's not nothing
[02:08:54] <earnestly> https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/09/04/making-world-class-docs-takes-effort/ basically
[02:09:02] <earnestly> Michael Kerrisk also thinks the same
[02:09:13] <cryptonector> I'm not sure I'd call the curl man page a world class doc
[02:09:19] <earnestly> They are very, very good
[02:09:25] <cryptonector> but mostly that would be because curl itself is not a world-class UI
[02:09:39] <earnestly> Not only does it explain what each flag does but it even includes the version those flags were added
[02:09:43] <earnestly> Which few tools do
[02:09:57] <earnestly> (Actually I don't know of any other tool that does this)
[02:10:07] <cryptonector> I also think curl tries to do too much (speaking more than HTTP)
[02:10:26] <cryptonector> back to bash...
[02:10:47] <earnestly> Same with ffmpeg, the scope will be complex, but the documentation is still good with that taken into account

[05:27:54] *** Joins: suffer (znc@mutant.penguin.fyi)
[05:27:57] <greycat> What that does will depend on which grep you're using.
[05:27:58] <wizhurd> .gblorb I meant
[05:28:29] <greycat> In standard unix grep, that should match a literal pipeline character.  But in GNU grep, \| means "break BRE compatibility and pretend this is an ERE just for one character, and do a union".
[05:28:42] <greycat> also, applying grep to a stream of filenames is idiotic
[05:29:18] <wizhurd> they are strings in .html
[05:29:50] <greycat> well, grep -E '.z5|.blorb' will match any string that contains "blorb" not at the start of a line.

[06:21:32] <greycat> Your command is exactly equivalent to:  ssh "$username@$remote" "bash -s" -- "${ARGS[@]}" < "$SCRIPT"
[06:21:34] <e36freak> with a new enough bash you can get around that with "${ARGS[@]@Q}"
[06:22:09] <e36freak> i'd probably write it as ssh "$username@$remote" "bash -s -- ${ARGS[*]@Q}" < "$SCRIPT"
[06:22:34] <greycat> And as the FAQ says, ssh user@host bash -s "arg one" "arg two"   is equivalent to   ssh user@host bash -s arg one arg two   because of how ssh works.
[06:24:37] <alguien> ARGS=("$(printf '%q\n' "${@:2}")");
[06:24:44] <alguien> FYI
[06:24:56] <alguien> oops, nvm the semicolon
[06:25:11] <e36freak> why even use an array then, you've bade a single string?
[06:25:24] <greycat> you can avoid the forks too
[06:25:26] <e36freak> oh no, you have newlines there
[06:25:29] <e36freak> that's why
[06:25:36] <e36freak> ssh sees bash -s -- arg1
[06:25:40] <e36freak> then arg2 on a new line
[06:25:53] <e36freak> '%q ', not '%q\n'
[06:26:31] <alguien> guess i'll never get bash arrays then
[06:26:36] <alguien> how do i get an array?
[06:26:48] <e36freak> you actually don't want or need an array here
[06:26:50] <greycat> You don't WANT an array because ssh won't PASS an array.  It passes a single string.
[06:26:51] <e36freak> because of how ssh works
[06:27:20] <alguien> it'll pass a single string to what?
[06:27:27] <greycat> To the remote host's shell for re-parsing.
[06:27:36] <e36freak> ssh takes all the arguments and clobbers them together into a single string separated by spaces

[16:23:13] <greybot> If you're asking "How can I find all the files that have been uploaded recently?" then you're probably in deep trouble. The server side can't tell when a file is finished uploading unless the client renames it or uploads an "all done" file afterward.

[18:54:16] <paws_> I'm starting a daemon from the terminal, with & at the end to run it on the background. If I run `jobs` after it, it doesn't list anything. It clearly still running because I still see the output of the process on the terminal. Any ideas?
[18:54:38] *** Joins: jetchisel (jetchisel@user/jetchisel)
[18:55:13] <Soliton> the daemon presumably backgrounds itself so the process you called is gone.
[18:55:16] <colo> paws_, maybe it double-forked, and the parent terminated? like a proper daemon does.
[18:55:26] <paws_> a simpler process like `command ping -i 5 google.com &` works as expected. What is this program doing to not show up? spawning a new process or something?

[19:16:11] <viv> Hey I am new to bash scripting and I wrote a small bash script that will change the filenames to the dates they were created (for photos and videos). How do I check which suffix the filename has (.mov, .png, .jpeg, ...) so the script will add the suffix to the filename?
[19:16:11] <Celmor[m]> yeah, I thought about that but my program writes these commands might have difficulties with more complicated programs
[19:16:52] <viv> I can also upload the script to pastebin or something similair

[19:18:50] <greybot> fakuve: ((...)) is an arithmetic command, which returns an exit status of 0 if the expression is nonzero, or 1 if the expression is zero. Also used as a synonym for "let", if side effects (assignments) are needed. See <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ArithmeticExpression>.
[19:18:57] <edk> many echos will just print everything if the argument doesn't look like a sensible option string, but it's fragile to rely on that

[19:20:51] <fakuve> OMGOMG: thanks
[19:20:52] <edk> echo -- isn't a thing
[19:21:34] <fakuve> what is wrong then with this ? is incrementing now the index variable , but keeps spitting `command not found line 7` on each iteration
[19:21:55] <fakuve> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/q6384dcw26/
[19:21:58] <OMGOMG> viv: ending? extension?
[19:22:33] <viv> OMGOMG: .txt for example
[19:22:49] <Celmor[m]> well, I know that my output always starts with newline, does characters at start of lines matter if I do `echo "$output"`?
[19:23:03] <Soliton> !echo
[19:23:04] <greybot> echo outputs a string. echo has many portability problems, and should never be used with option flags. Consider printf instead: printf 'name: %s\n' "$name". http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/commands/builtin/echo | http://cfajohnson.com/shell/cus-faq.html#Q0b | http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/echo+printf
[19:23:15] <osse> fakuve: $(( )) expands to the resulting value
[19:23:27] <osse> similar to $var or $(cmd) in that sense
[19:23:37] <fakuve> so it will echo it , is it?
[19:23:52] <OMGOMG> # a=foo.tar.gz; echo "${a##*.}"
[19:23:53] <osse> sure, if you put echo in front of it
[19:23:54] <shbot> OMGOMG: gz
[19:24:46] <viv> OMGOMG: thanks
[19:24:47] <edk> Celmor[m]: i doubt it, but i don't know; printf '%s\n' is the echo -- that never was, i suggest it's easier to use that than figure out if your echo will always work everywhere
[19:25:24] <Celmor[m]> alright, so this is always safe: printf '%s\n' "$output" > file
[19:25:40] <fakuve> osse: well how can I perform a Math operation without it trying to output something to be executed then?
[19:26:22] <fakuve> I know there may be other ways to increment a counter but I want to do it this way
[19:26:32] <edk> Celmor[m]: yes

[23:10:05] <wizhurd> how can i remove duplicate from a text file without sorting?
[23:12:01] <greycat> !uniq
[23:12:01] <greybot> is a utility for removing or reporting repeated lines. uniq will only work for showing unique lines when used with sorted input (sort | uniq). Alternatively, use sort -u. awk '!s[$0]++' is an order-insensitive alternative.
[23:12:04] <wizhurd> except if the sort command can be used in that, which I don't understand
[23:13:29] <phy1729> There's an awk alternative
[23:13:34] <greycat> Most of the standard Unix tools were developed in the days when computer memory was measured in kilobytes, not megabytes or gigabytes.  Memory usage is kept low.
[23:14:18] <greycat> Take uniq(1) as an example.  It can detect duplicate lines in sorted input.  It does this by remembering only the *previous* line, and comparing that to the current line.  Memory use is therefore very low, no matter how large the input is.
[23:14:42] <wizhurd> interesting
[23:15:02] <greycat> In order to detect duplicates in unsorted input, you either have to remember every line you've seen so far, or else keep a hash of each input line you've seen, and have a way to go back to the original line in case the hash is seen again.
[23:15:17] <wizhurd> do I just do uniq file file2
[23:15:28] <greycat> The awk command in the bot's factoid keeps track of every line seen.  It uses a lot of memory.
[23:15:42] <greycat> ... now I'm seeing why people told me to /ignore you.
[23:15:49] <wizhurd> heh

[23:29:46] <wizhurd> okay I'll try to be more modest in my questions
[23:29:51] <greycat> yes, I suppose you could send *two* files to a uniq command at once, and thereby detect duplicates between the two files, as long as they are both sorted, and one is sorted entirely before the other, but that sounds super unlikely

[23:49:20] <thebombzen> I have a BASH script and I'd like it to run some function, defined in the script itself, in the background but exit first. Is it sufficient to put "run_long_command & exit" as the last line of the file? or does that command have to be a separate script and not a simple function?
[23:49:46] <koala_man> no that's fine. if it's the last line you don't even need the exit

[23:50:14] <thebombzen> and the fact that bash itself is still running won't be an issue for whatever (non-interactive) thing is calling this script, right?
[23:51:02] <thebombzen> (basically I have a script that checks if some image is valid, and if it is, it goes "it's valid" and it uploads it to a location on the network. ideally I'd like that network upload to not block)
[23:51:03] <koala_man> that depends more on that thing
[23:52:38] <thebombzen> I mean, in this case it's actually python invoking subprocess.run on the script, which blocks until the process exits, so I'm wondering if the process will exit if I run "run_long_command & exit" or if the bash process will stay open until the & job is complete
[23:52:58] <thebombzen> but it appears you said it should work
[23:52:59] <koala_man> the process will exit
[23:53:14] <thebombzen> thanks
[23:53:25] <koala_man> however, stdin/out and any other FDs will remain open
[23:53:54] <thebombzen> ah, I see. so if it works by checking open FDs rather than by the process, then it might continue to block

[23:57:28] <thebombzen> hm, in this case I do want to capture output, but the "long_command" produces no output
[23:57:42] <thebombzen> it just dumps errors to a file if they occur
[23:58:15] <thebombzen> in this case, do I close fds 0-2 before calling "long_command"?
[23:58:20] *** Joins: fedenix (~fedenix@gateway/tor-sasl/fedenix)
[23:58:40] <koala_man> yeah you could do that. long_command < /dev/null > /dev/null 2>&1 &
[23:58:55] <thebombzen> Ah, so I don't even need to close them, I can just redirect them
[23:59:10] <koala_man> you can close them but some tools don't like that
[23:59:27] <thebombzen> in this case if I run long_command </dev/null >/dev/null 2>some_file.log &, does that work too? or does it have to be something dummy like null
