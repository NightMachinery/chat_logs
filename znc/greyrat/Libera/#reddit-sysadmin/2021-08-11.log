[00:00:52] <mistiry> exactly what it says

[00:01:39] <oxipital> well i have years exp with that
[00:01:42] <mistiry> not exactly
[00:02:10] * oxipital read the google snippet
[00:02:18] <oxipital> well, seems straightforward all the same
[00:02:37] <mistiry> usually its the last stop before release, where real-world users test the system/application and accept or signoff on it showing their acceptance of its behavior, etc.
[00:02:41] <mistiry> it is
[00:03:42] <mistiry> Client: "It should do A, B, and C"  you do the work, they perform UAT and say "yes, we agree that it does A, B, and C as requested"

[07:46:07] <gibby> there was a party on Saturday night where they caused a bunch of damage to one of the rooms there. Apparently some ceiling and chandelier damage and Bally's was pissed 
[07:46:18] <mistiry> oof

[07:47:04] <gibby> closing ceremonies there were a bunch of beach balls getting hit around, causing more damage to another chandelier and they sent a few Bally's security people to take the balls
[07:47:27] <gibby> it was fucking great
[07:47:46] <mistiry> haha i can just imagine them running around chasing balls
[07:47:56] <gibby> they were pissed heh

[07:49:18] <gibby> defcon is a proper party, you just gotta go
[07:49:29] <gibby> work hard, play hard, etc
[07:49:31] <higeki> one day!
[07:49:56] <gibby> they've released the dates/location for DEFCON 30. 
[07:50:02] <gibby> might be a good one to attend 
[07:50:09] <higeki> orly
[07:50:12] <gibby> yarly
[07:51:09] <higeki> what is your favorite thing about defcon?
[07:52:29] <gibby> yes.
[07:53:03] <higeki> great answer heh
[07:53:11] <higeki> i believe it
[07:53:28] <gibby> I get to meet a ton of great people, catch up with friends, attend some fucking amazing talks, participate in amazing self or group activities, attempt to understand the scavenger hunt/badge stuff, and party
[07:53:55] <gibby> so, lots of swag, stickers, THE FUCKING BADGE, and its in Vegas 
[07:54:29] <higeki> I love that there's multiple ARGs going on right under everyone's nose
[07:54:36] <higeki> that's great to hear though
[07:54:43] <JollyRgrs> and when he bends over, he gets pegged by at least 12 different bronies
[07:54:48] <gibby> ^
[07:54:48] <JollyRgrs> that's his fav part he doesn't mention
[07:54:54] <gibby> ^
[07:55:04] <higeki> hey that works
[07:55:27] <gibby> one of my favorite moments of the weekend was when me and two of my buddies were standing near one of the maps on the floor discussing what it could mean for some of the things at the event
[07:55:40] <gibby> this was later at night when we were all partying
[07:56:02] <gibby> anywho, people started coming over and just looking at the same floor map
[07:56:17] <gibby> so my buddy says "see, there are FOUR of them here!"
[07:56:38] <gibby> and I reply "nonono, there are SIX! 2 there, 2 over there, one there and one there!"
[07:57:00] <gibby> which draws a larger crowd, because people presume we're in the middle of figuring something out
[07:57:45] <gibby> so he and I bullshit for like 5 more minutes about the connection with the map and the badge lanyard which has a ruler and its role with this map
[07:58:02] <gibby> then walk away saying "ok, its late enough, lets continue tomorrow" 
[07:58:06] <JollyRgrs> lol!
[07:58:20] <JollyRgrs> see, i enjoy a good troll like that
[07:58:26] <gibby> there must have been 20 people standing around this map when we left all trying to figure out wtf we were talking about
[07:58:41] <JollyRgrs> haha
[07:58:44] <JollyRgrs> GOT EM!
[07:58:47] <gibby> :D
[07:58:51] <higeki> thats big brain
[07:59:01] <higeki> gotta keep em guessing
[07:59:22] <gibby> I love this years badge though 
[08:01:30] <higeki> hadn't seen it but yeah, it's amazing
[08:01:47] <gibby> I was lucky to get the signal pretty early on
[08:01:54] <gibby> and spread my seed

[10:01:17] <JollyRgrs> 1. Go to computer settings
[10:01:19] <JollyRgrs> 2. Accounts
[10:01:21] <JollyRgrs> 3. Email & accounts
[10:01:23] <JollyRgrs> 4. Click on the Accounts > Manage > Remove this account from this device.
[10:01:32] <sd> 02<r​yalln> Yes, but that means I hav to do it every time a dickhead does it
[10:01:37] <JollyRgrs> so now you just gotta automate the clearing of that for all but the account you want to keep on there
[10:01:38] <xe0n> gpo
[10:01:41] <gibby> that'll be $500 plsktbhx
[10:01:44] <xe0n> not store network creds etc etc

[10:02:21] <sd> 02<r​yalln> if your in perth Maybe
[10:02:27] <sd> 02<r​yalln> but i need like 6 months to look sxy
[10:02:44] <JollyRgrs> 6 months? my wife's been waiting over 10 yrs
[10:02:46] <csws> tbh JollyRgrs' advice isn't even worth a beer sadly
[10:02:48] <JollyRgrs> i'm still not lookin sexy
[10:03:12] <JollyRgrs> csws: my advice was more birds eye view
[10:03:25] <csws> maybe xe0n's is worth a virtual beer
[10:03:34] <csws> at this rate he'll never be able to leave nsw to get a real one in perth
[10:04:10] <sd> 02<r​yalln> haha
[10:04:20] <sd> 02<r​yalln> I will say the teams room idea so far looks good
[10:04:34] <csws> those MTR units?

[10:04:55] <csws> they're actually not bad
[10:05:08] <csws> but the crestron, logitech, etc. units are shit
[10:05:26] <csws> imo lenovo is the way to go because they use an SFF desktop whereas the other guys are using a surface pro in a box with all of the surface pro reliability
[10:06:17] <xe0n> lenovo anything is JUNK

[10:07:13] <A-KO> we've got Logitech's devices
[10:07:20] <xe0n> yes, set plenty of them up in shared spaces\meeting rooms\whatever
[10:07:28] <csws> @ryalln for MTR? it has to be the special hardware as they come pre built with win 10 IoT and a bunch of customisations. if you fry those customisations you have to reinstall using an ISO they provide
[10:07:42] <xe0n> its just android with the teams client lol
[10:07:45] <sd> 02<r​yalln> Thats I thought
[10:07:46] <csws> noo
[10:07:48] <csws> that's different

[10:08:45] <csws> it auto boots into some UWP app which runs the meeting software
[10:08:55] <csws> a special cut down version of teams and skype
[10:09:02] <csws> you can put them in full teams mode though to get rid of the skype shit now
[10:09:24] <csws> the support guys got antsy about even domain joining these things
[10:09:59] <csws> and tbh they are right.. the recommendation was to slap them in an OU with inheritance blocked for instance

[10:48:35] <xe0n> datsss raccciiissttt
[10:50:08] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> pt. deux: what to document.
[10:50:08] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> Yes, that's indeed what I'm trying to do.
[10:50:08] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> What I'm struggeling with, besides typing the word struggling, is exactly what and how far to take it.
[10:50:08] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> Very specific stuff obviously needs to be documented
[10:50:08] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> But do you type out the entire AD structure? What groups are used for what? Or do you just fill in the security group description box and assume the next guys will be able to figure that out?
[10:50:08] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> For specific software, do you type out a few of the most common procedures/problems, or do you leave that out and just assume they'll RTFM?
[10:50:27] <sd> 07<x​oxo> if you think "I need to remember this" you need it
[10:50:36] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> oh, that "yes, that's what I'm trying to do" was pointed at the comment "type it like you're leaving"
[10:52:01] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> There's a lot of things that I need to remember, or that's at the very least useful to remember
[10:52:20] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> to get back to my VOIP dialplan that I finished yesterday
[10:52:35] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> besides the dialplan, I made changes to the thing too
[10:52:39] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> we use freepbx
[10:52:48] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> do I document how to make said changes?
[10:52:51] <xe0n> yes
[10:52:56] <xe0n> anything repeatable should be documented
[10:53:00] <xe0n> that's the process...
[10:53:26] <xe0n> if you have some whacky service that you need to update certs on, and everytime you do it you're like how do i do that again, or jeez this is a pain in the ass, document it
[10:53:31] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> question, not arguing: isn't that basically just typing out a manual?
[10:53:42] <xe0n> so when the next sysadmin comes along, you dont go "oh errrr he doesn't even know how to do X, or errrrrrr he did it wrong"
[10:53:50] <xe0n> well if it's documented and the process is in paper, follow that, can't go wrong
[10:53:56] <JollyRgrs> TBH, the best way for me to document repeatable steps... first, script it if you can. script cannot be "the entire documentation" but it will help a lot
[10:54:24] <JollyRgrs> scripting it means that when you implement, you'll do it right every time b/c no fat fingers or forgetting a step
[10:54:25] <xe0n> if there's a specific way you want things done (a process), document it
[10:54:34] <xe0n> if a script is the answer, then the documentation is "run X script"
[10:54:41] <JollyRgrs> if you can't "actually" script it... psuedo-code the script that you will follow
[10:54:51] <xe0n> but there should still be some written docu that says what you need to do (run the script)
[10:56:24] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> ha, tiny epiphany: just write it so me from x years ago would be able to do all the tasks I need to do today?
[10:56:28] <xe0n> i dig the taskbar grouping things in win11
[10:56:35] <xe0n> correct
[10:56:42] <xe0n> i document my own stuff all the time, i can't remember everything
[10:57:04] <JollyRgrs> ugh... i hate zoneminder, but can't find a better replacement
[10:57:14] <sd> 07<x​oxo> is win10>win11 a "feature upgrade" or is it a new install
[10:57:22] <xe0n> it's an upgrade yes
[10:57:37] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> Shit, I need to document a LOT more
[10:57:40] <sd> 07<x​oxo> if I can manage it via intune it's not so bad
[10:57:56] <JollyRgrs> every time i install it... you can apt install it, but you gotta do these "wiki documented" things before/after you install the package... then there's a bug from 2015 that was fixed (.conf file is root:root should be root:www-data) and was reportedly fixed... but i still had that issue :/
[10:57:57] <xe0n> well its a new os install...its not a feature update for 10, its an upgrade from 10
[10:58:00] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> Step 1: www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin
[10:58:14] <sd> 07<x​oxo> oh...
[10:58:21] <xe0n> 10 is 10, 11 is 11
[10:58:22] <xe0n> lol
[10:58:26] <sd> 07<x​oxo> well that's shit
[10:58:29] <xe0n> you can upgrade the os, and probably do it through intune eventually
[10:58:56] <JollyRgrs> xe0n: it upgrades, but more like w7 to w10 upgrade, not 20h2 to 21h1 type upgrade, right?
[10:58:57] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> Thanks guys.
[10:58:57] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> I'm the only "IT guy" in the place, so it's great to be able to talk to you guys about simple stuff like this
[10:59:00] <sd> 07<x​oxo> hoping it gets treated like a feature update since they've only just added good controls around that

[11:00:47] <JollyRgrs> you have until 2025, my suggestion is to get new device rollouts using w11 as soon as possible, then work on an opt-in plan for w11 upgrades for existing... and via that and attrition... good chance you won't be scrambling by 2025
[11:00:55] <sd> 02<S​ir Sceptalot> being from the lower end of that spectrum, it's a bit daunting. I feel like a toddler waddling around at the dinner table asking for help to put my toy tractor together

[11:04:24] <JollyRgrs> 1) you have no one internally to rely on, it is your responsibility to not only implement changes, but also push to make changes and convince non-IT people why you should change. in a larger org, that is spread out through many people

[15:24:32] <Rpifan> I went straight to general on my first try

[15:24:56] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> had my morse ticket, but never read the book for general
[15:25:15] <Rpifan> The extra class is kinda pointless but most importantly it restricts you from talking to South America

[15:25:28] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> no.... it doesn't?
[15:25:41] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> every class has the same restrictions on frequencies
[15:25:51] <Rpifan> I think it was 7mhz 
[15:25:52] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> hence why DX stations sometimes listen like, 10khz above, but respond below
[15:26:05] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> they respond where they're allowed, but listen where you're allowed

[23:55:17] <rpifan_> the german govt is so bad that they actually dont know how many ppl have been vaccinated lol
[23:55:28] <sintax> awesome.
[23:55:42] <rpifan_> i mean they gave out these vaccines no one else and yet they are saying there is are at least 1000 ppl who may or may not be vaccinated but the records dont match
[23:56:26] <sd> 09<S​mellySalad> Doesn't surprise me, records matching would require having reliable staff inputting the info, and data analysts
[23:56:33] <sd> 09<S​mellySalad> that know what they are doing
[23:56:50] <rpifan_> you have no clue how chaotic and disorganized the german govt is
[23:57:20] <sd> 09<S​mellySalad> having a workflow where everything will match up in the end requires multiple people following the same protocol. damn near impossible with the level of incompetency you see in the workforce
[23:58:06] <rpifan_> as a little side story. i sent a request for the foreingers office appoint in april, i got the appoint for august
[23:58:21] <rpifan_> i went to see them and said sorry now its too late i dont have a job anymore. i sent you the request in april
