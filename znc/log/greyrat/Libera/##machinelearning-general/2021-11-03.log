[21:09:27] <tomeaton17> coraxx do you mean regression vs classification?
[21:09:40] <coraxx> tomeaton17: Machine learning is about making the best and most accurate prediction ...
[21:10:43] <tomeaton17> coraxx and statistical isn't?
[21:10:53] <coraxx> tomeaton17: Statistical models are designed for inference about the relationships between variables.

[21:12:23] <[itchyjunk]> i don't see a real difference other than naming scheme
[21:12:58] <[itchyjunk]> a ML model could just be a model that learn the relationship in the data
[21:13:29] <[itchyjunk]> imho, unsupervised learning is a ML model and it fits the "learn the relationships" paradigm

[21:18:14] <coraxx> [itchyjunk]: yes ..very prof. videos ... and the traveling salesman is a classic ...
[21:18:24] <tomeaton17> Well I am currently studying VC theory and that is based on statistical learning theory
[21:18:49] <coraxx> [itchyjunk]: I've heard a lot about that one, because it was one of those problems that Quantum Computing claimed it had the answer for.
[21:19:09] <tomeaton17> but I suppose you can't really separate the two fields as statistics is very important in giving us generalisation bounds.
[21:19:21] <tomeaton17> But would you say that linear regression is not machine learning?
[21:20:05] <[itchyjunk]> quantum anneling problems yes
[21:21:51] <[itchyjunk]> tomeaton17, if you find the line of best fit by applying some formula, it's say its a statistical result. if you have an algo that iteratively reduces some error function, maybe it's machine learning?
[21:22:17] <[itchyjunk]> is the distinction really important, though?
[21:22:39] <tomeaton17> yeah I would probably agree it doesn't seem right if there is an analytical solution
[21:22:47] <[itchyjunk]> i wanna learn some basic things like travelling salesman problem. would pytorch be good for that?
[21:22:52] <tomeaton17> No the distinction is not important at all. Just interesting to discuss
[21:23:31] <[itchyjunk]> i always imagined learning in ML was learning some weights or somesuch to find some best fit approximation of some hypothetical function-like thing
[21:23:41] <[itchyjunk]> not sure how rigorous that idea would be
[21:24:29] <tomeaton17> You might find it more useful to start from scratch with a problem like that. There are many interesting algorithms you can use for travelling salesman, personally, I am a big fan on simulated annealing
[21:25:01] <[itchyjunk]> i did a XOR approximator from scratch
[21:25:02] <tomeaton17> [itchyjunk] thats pretty much the concept, with the hypothetical function-like thing called the target function :)
[21:25:16] <[itchyjunk]> it was a bit painful and i was recommended to use abstract frameworks like pytorch first
[21:25:20] <[itchyjunk]> and go into details later
[21:25:32] <[itchyjunk]> is it always a function?
[21:25:39] <[itchyjunk]> i've read that ANNs are always functions
[21:25:53] <[itchyjunk]> but i am not sure if say binary trees or some such are also function or not
[21:26:16] <coraxx> [itchyjunk]: somebody used pytorch and reinforcement learning to solve the Travelling salesman....

[21:26:52] <[itchyjunk]> I am looking for simplest possible way to approach it all :P
[21:27:30] <tomeaton17> Yes I would say that there is always a target function, the learning model does not affect that
[21:31:13] <coraxx> "the travelling salesman" sounds so clean and sober ... I like that they also refer to is as "Pub Crawls"  ;-)

[21:33:31] <[itchyjunk]> apparently, the mathematicians who found partial solution won nobel prize in economics
[21:33:34] <coraxx> [itchyjunk]: ah ok ..sound interesting.
[21:33:46] <[itchyjunk]> my prof said they might be the first mathematicians to win nobel prize in economics
[21:35:48] <coraxx> I guess today that the things that really can change the world is knowledge, systems and data analysis ... and anyone who turns it in to pratical model and shape the world for the better is up for a nobel prize
[21:36:27] <[itchyjunk]> I detest smart people because they make me realize how dumb i am =)

[21:41:58] <SigmoidFroid> ⇒  What is Quantum Machine Learning? — PennyLane
[21:45:17] <mefistofeles> [itchyjunk]: the simplest approach to travelling salesman is just the greedy algorithm, it scales exponentially, though :P
[21:45:25] <mefistofeles> so that's why some heuristics are desired
[21:45:38] <mefistofeles> and that were all the ML machinery (pun intended) enters
[21:45:39] <[itchyjunk]> i don't mind the lack of scalability
[21:45:47] <[itchyjunk]> what do i need to know to implement greedy algo?
[21:47:04] <tomeaton17> I would recommend implementing simulated annealing, its pretty simple algorithm
[21:47:14] <mefistofeles> it is pretty straight forward , I'd say it is also pretty naive because yu would have to generate all permutations of travelling points
[21:47:30] <mefistofeles> so it isn't even exponential but factorial :P
[21:47:42] <hodapp> quantum algorithms have been due Real Soon Now for like the last 30 years
[21:48:01] <mefistofeles> hodapp: there are plenty of physical realizations of quantum computers already

[21:48:32] <mefistofeles> that said, the practicality of them is still an issue, but that's just the engineering part and it's just getting better

[21:50:26] <mefistofeles> oh sure, I'm not saying that it's easy
[21:50:36] <mefistofeles> I guess it depends on what you mean by what you said originally
[21:50:49] <mefistofeles> but we clearly have physical realization of pure quantum computers today that we didn't have 30 years ago
[21:50:59] <mefistofeles> that said, the most useful ones are not pure quantum computers, that's true

[23:05:33] <mefistofeles> you probably don't have virtualenv installed in the system, but I recommend building the environment yourself and point pycharm to it
