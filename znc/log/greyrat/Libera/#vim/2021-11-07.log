[00:00:29] <vvdaiwrw> vim has got terminal impl after nvim's but from what I recall vim's behavior seems more well implemented or behaved. nvim has some annoying issues with quitting their terminal and such.
[00:01:23] <vvdaiwrw> maybe same happens on syntax highlight realm.

[00:18:33] <m_ben> romainl: so what can you say about its syntax highlighting compared to vim?
[00:18:58] <vvdaiwrw> 1300ac: "and then romainl comes from textmate to vim"
[00:19:40] <romainl> I never finished it but I worked on an AS3 syntax a bit before I switched to Vim and it was relatively straightforward. Not fun because XML, but the scoping mechanism generally made sense. On the colorscheme side it was pretty easy because of the scoping thing, precisely. As for performance, there was no lag or FOUC whatsoever. Really smooth.

[00:26:01] <romainl> https://macromates.com/manual/en/themes the built-in UI for making themes was nifty
[00:26:51] <romainl> but in the end it was still regexp-based so, if regexp is the cause of Vim's syntax highlighting issues, the TM mechanism won't help
[00:29:18] <romainl> like I said earlier, TM was a modern "best in class" OS X app with great performance, which implies multithreading and all, and Vim is anything but modern and multithreaded so I'm not even sure switching "engines" would be of any help
[00:29:51] <m_ben> well, TM relies on oniguruma regexes, vim has its own flavor
[00:29:57] <romainl> yes
[00:30:02] <bfredl> it would be interesting with some real speed comparisons. hopefully converting 4854 lines of typescript to C shouldn't be necessary for TM support tho..
[00:30:20] <romainl> as I mentioned earlier, too, we already got a second RE engine not too long ago
[00:30:22] *** Joins: Enitin (~Enitin@82.102.22.85)
[00:30:26] <bfredl> TM:s implementation seems pretty modular, but it is GPL3 c++, which might be a deal breaker?
[00:31:30] <romainl> I talk without knowing it, but I have a hunch regular expressions are not the problem, here
[00:31:37] <m_ben> oniguruma itself is approx 80k sloc. I highly doubt bram would include yet another regex engine
[00:31:57] <m_ben> though, oniguruma supports recursive patterns, that's something we don't have (yet)
[00:32:00] <romainl> well we got an audio player
[00:32:07] <vvdaiwrw> :D
[00:32:40] <vvdaiwrw> can anyone inform what's the use case that caused that to get in? blips?
[00:32:48] <romainl> I think drawing is the issue, not "parsing"
[00:33:37] <bfredl> the issue is that vim needs to rerun a lot of regexes each time you redraw, even though the buffer wasn't even changed
[00:33:54] <bfredl> in principle you could implement a cache upon the existing engine even

[00:37:45] <romainl> (AFAIK)
[00:38:08] <bfredl> it needs to rely on "synced" syntax states for partial redraws. which, sometimes, get out of sync :)

[00:45:06] <vvdaiwrw> but it's two big shits, I rather prefer one small one.
[00:47:07] <romainl> anyway… in TM and other GUI editors, the "buffer" is a single discrete "view" that doesn't stop being rendered when parts of it are not displayed (when you scroll, etc.) whereas in Vim you have the "virtual" buffer, the data structure on one side and the only thing that is being rendered is what is displayed in the window.
[00:47:37] <romainl> because there is only one view, for everything
[00:47:55] <romainl> that limits things quite a lot
[00:48:51] <bfredl> yea, any effort for s m o o t h   s c r o l l i n g or anything like that in vim gets pretty weird when you take vims handlig of wrapped lines in account

[00:54:00] <romainl> If we can manage to stop Vim from doing all those calculations upon redraw we can have a more satisfying highlighting experience. And, to me, it doesn't seem that changing engines is the right direction to take.
