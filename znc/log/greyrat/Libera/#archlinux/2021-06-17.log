[01:14:03] <wasamasa> I remember having used a tool many years ago that allows you to recreate a PKGBUILD from an installed package

[01:15:21] <BrainDamage> you can't recreate a pkgbuild, but you can recreate a package by compressing the content of the fs

[01:15:32] <phrik> Title: pacman/Tips and tricks - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[01:15:34] <demize> I believe you might be misremembering and are thinking of bacman, which could recreate built packages from the installed state.
[01:15:39] <wasamasa> yes, bacman
[01:15:51] <wasamasa> thank you
[01:16:01] <wasamasa> so I guess that PKGBUILD is lost, eh
[01:16:19] <demize> Yeah, there isn't enough data in the installed state to recreate it, hm.
[01:16:51] <demize> But if it's either an old repo or AUR package the history will generally be recoverable.
[01:17:22] <wasamasa> no, it's something I forgot to commit/push to https://depp.brause.cc/pkgbuilds/

The laptop on which I wish to replace GRUB has the unencrypted ESP mounted under /efi and /boot inside the LUKS container. Since the loader configuration for systemd-boot should be under /boot/loader, I'm not sure how that would work?

[12:04:38] <alschaapman> Recommendations about where to mount that partition largely have to do with how existing tools like pacman hooks will interact with the contents of any partitions that need to be available at the UEFI stage

[12:05:30] <WinterStar> alschaapman: In the current scenario, there is only GRUBX64.EFI on the ESP, which unlocks the LUKS volume where /boot (with the kernel, initramfs, grub config etc) resides.
[12:05:44] <alschaapman> And yeah, if you want to use systemd-boot, you can either use an unencrypted extended boot loader partition (which must be FAT) or everything needed for the pre-initramfs stages of your boot must go on the ESP

[12:06:41] <alschaapman> WinterStar: So to migrate to systemd-boot you'll need to start putting your kernel and initramfs on the ESP or an unencrypted FAT partition -- see above
[12:06:56] <WinterStar> That's what I figured/feared

[12:07:40] <alschaapman> If you're concerned about kernel/initramfs security you might consider signing them with your own keys and enrolling the keys in Secure Boot

[12:08:41] <WinterStar> Seems less secure though: in theory, even if the .efi's on /boot and vmlinuz are signed against secureboot, anyone could still tamper with the loader configuration for systemd-boot, since they are plaintext files on an unencrypted partition (e.g. one could remove kernel options such as LSM)

[12:17:25] <alschaapman> I ran into something annoying with Restic that had to do with either backing up or extracting certain parts of the file system hierarchy based on a relative rather than absolute pathname, and just gave up on it at that point

[21:02:19] <prurigro> that's a good point- if it tries to pull in updated libraries along with the package, just update the whole system
[21:02:34] <NetSysFire> you still dont want to update only a specific package

[21:02:38] <NetSysFire> unless you really know what you are doing
[21:02:44] <prurigro> if it offers only the package you want and maybe some new packages you're not going to break your system, but the package you pulled in might not work
[21:03:00] <MrElendig> even more fun: you get a silent corruption
[21:03:08] *** Joins: zarakshR (~Thunderbi@202.38.180.58)
[21:03:17] <prurigro> yeah, if it's a big complex thing like firefox I'd just do the full system update
[21:03:32] <MrElendig> which you don't notice until eg all your backups are broken
[21:03:35] <prurigro> anything mission critical
[21:03:58] <NetSysFire> you just do a full system update its not so hard, really
[21:04:10] <jkc> prurigro: No. Stop. pacman -S or -Syu. Never -y without -u.
[21:06:00] <prurigro> ok, fair, I'm giving bad advice as a general rule. nifl was asking if its possible and I was trying to explain what could be done and what the pitfalls might be, but yeah, if you don't know what you're doing and what the risks are just update the system like everyone's saying

[21:10:31] <prurigro> like some package updates wouldn't come through
[21:10:38] <NetSysFire> -Sy only refreshes the databases, no packages are updated
[21:10:40] <prurigro> including required libraries
[21:10:45] <NetSysFire> so if your very next step is -Su its alright
[21:10:56] <alad> MrElendig: I like how you used red for that one
[21:10:57] <prurigro> yes, sorry, Syyu vs Syu
[21:10:59] *** Joins: eirik (~eirik@157.97.120.52)
[21:11:07] <NetSysFire> !Syyu
[21:11:08] <phrik> The double yy in `pacman -Syyu` is almost never needed. If you're switching to a mirror that uses an older copy of the repos, see !Syyuu instead. Unless your repo databases are completely corrupted, force-downloading already-up-to-date ones accomplishes nothing other than to waste bandwidth and server load. Do your part in conserving the internet, and avoid Syyu!
[21:11:15] *** Joins: manti7 (~manti7@176.10.104.94)
[21:11:34] <MrElendig> "having" to use -Syy is often a good indication that your clock is messed up, or broken mirror
[21:11:42] <prurigro> ahh, maybe the situation was my main mirror was timing out and it flipped to the next one
[21:11:44] <MrElendig> both of which should be fixed instead
[21:12:19] *** doublej41 is now known as doublej472

[22:41:54] <eschwartz> it's usable and gets things done, but there's definite interest in getting a new one done right, from scratch
[22:42:07] <Repentinus> Aye, /me wants bcachefs to succeed too.

[22:42:46] <eschwartz> the bcachefs developer doesn't think zfs is the right filesystem either, even *without* the license question
[22:42:46] <sensille> given all that, i probably start with ext4 :)
[22:42:48] <eschwartz> > zfs, to which we all owe a debt for showing us what could be done in a COW filesystem, but is never going to be a first class citizen on Linux. Also, they made certain design compromises that I can't fault them for - but it's possible to better. (Primarily, zfs is block based, not extent based, whereas all other modern filesystems have been extent based for years: the reason they did this is
[22:42:50] <eschwartz> that extents plus snapshots are really hard).
[22:43:10] *** Joins: kulak (~kulak@user/kulak)
[22:43:35] <sensille> on the plus side zfs is very clean
[22:43:39] *** Joins: nahtjona (~nahtjona@host168.190-229-153.telecom.net.ar)
[22:44:15] <Repentinus> I am sure they have good reasons for thinking so, but until they or anyone else can provide a better replacement with feature parity, it's bit of a moot point. :-P
[22:44:25] <prurigro> sensille: one more option that I don't think has been mentioned is you could maintain your own personal linux package with zfs patched in
[22:44:33] <prurigro> fine-tune it to your system
[22:44:49] <Repentinus> You just want to make their life harder, don't you?
[22:44:49] <eschwartz> compiling not just zfs, but the kernel too??? :o

[22:45:19] <prurigro> last time I compiled the kernel it took like 5 minutes
[22:45:23] <eschwartz> zfs on its own already takes way too long to build (and that's just to run ./configure)

[22:45:37] *** Quits: chance (~chance@50.47.109.175) (Quit: Client closed)
[22:46:09] <eschwartz> because the openzfs devs insist on using ./configure checks to define macros switching kernel version support on/off 
[22:46:17] <prurigro> not a bad idea, and I think ext4 is a solid choice for root-- I started using it when it became stable and I still choose it for new systems 
[22:46:33] <eschwartz> instead of using preprocessor KERNEL_VERSION() macro checks
[22:46:35] *** Quits: mesaboogie (mesaboogie@user/mesaboogie) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[22:46:37] <Repentinus> [18:15:19] <prurigro> last time I compiled the kernel it took like 5 minutes
[22:46:44] <Repentinus> We don't know what hardware they have…
[22:46:53] <prurigro> yeah, I was going to add that I have decently fast hardware
[22:47:11] <Repentinus> And the zfs-dkms compilation time is noticeable on a Ryzen 3900x.
[22:47:17] <sensille> nuc11 i3
[22:47:24] <sensille> only 2 cores
[22:47:28] <eschwartz> I still think this is just... terrible. They run *configure* checks repeatedly for compiling test code and seeing how many arguments to a function etc.
[22:47:35] <prurigro> ahh ok, yeah, that might take a while haha
[22:47:37] <eschwartz> configure checks are really slow
[22:48:12] <prurigro> configure is definitely the bottleneck on faster CPUs with tons of cores
[22:48:19] <Repentinus> Well, as we know they were okay with `which` in a contributed shell script too.
[22:48:42] <prurigro> wait really?
[22:49:17] <Repentinus> Really. I recently wasted a few days tracking that down on a fresh install.
[22:49:21] <eschwartz> the kernel specifically supports blazing-fast LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(the,one,I,want)
[22:49:50] <eschwartz> so that you can if/else your code based on the kernel version something got added or changed
[22:49:59] <eschwartz> the openzfs developers REFUSE TO USE IT
[22:50:40] <eschwartz> "we need to check the actual compile tested interface, because someone's franken-kernel might backport API differences and prevent compilation"
[22:51:31] <Repentinus> I don't understand why they consider it their problem…
[22:51:55] <Repentinus> Frankenstein's kernel should be Frankenstein's problem.
[22:52:04] <eschwartz> it's not their problem, it's the problem of people running ./configure :p
