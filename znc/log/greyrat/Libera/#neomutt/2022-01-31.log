[14:29:17] <gahr> hi flatcap 
[14:29:56] <gahr> doesn't ncurses expose an API to "make sure we're in alternate screen"?
[14:30:05] <gahr> cause we don't explicitely go there ourselves right? We rely on ncurses to do it
[14:30:16] <gahr> it's a bit weird we have to forse it ourselves at this point
[14:30:20] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[14:30:50] <flatcap> ncurses gets confused, I think because pin-entry is changing the mode...
[14:31:18] <flatcap> I tried a series of `endwin(); refresh()` after the pinentry, but it didn't work...
[14:31:41] <gahr> and god-forbid if we can call initscr again :D
[14:31:48] <flatcap> argh!
[14:32:06] <flatcap> I imagine that'd wipe all our colour pairs, etc
[14:32:09] <gahr> I'm just a bit unconfortable with messing with stderr
[14:32:30] <gahr> stdout + fflush?
[14:32:37] <flatcap> I can change it to stdout -- I can repeat the problem
[14:34:11] * flatcap builds ...
[14:43:20] <flatcap> ok, it still works with stdout (no fflush() needed)

[14:44:46] <flatcap> oh
[14:48:17] <flatcap> I was wrong, the fflush() is needed for stdout
[14:51:40] <gahr> or you could push a \n at the end of the fputs escape sequence
[14:52:50] <flatcap> hmm...
[14:54:10] <flatcap> that could cause the screen to move

[15:41:11] <flatcap> p00f: sorry, I don't have time to help, but...
[15:41:46] <flatcap> here's my template gmail config.  the important bit is to use your email *address* as the username

[16:30:46] <p00f> ohh thanks
[16:32:07] <kaji> Hi, I wonder if anyone could tell me how do I sort fastmail labels with neomutt? They appear to be many folders (with duplicates). Is there a way to optimize the display?
[16:36:39] <kaji> source: https://www.fastmail.help/hc/en-us/articles/1500000278282
[16:44:32] <gahr> kaji: no, the concept of labels can't be mapped toIMAP
[16:47:53] <gahr> fastmail uses JMAP under the hood, where each message has a unique id across mailboxes and can belong to multiple mailboxes
[16:48:11] <gahr> mailboxes in JMAP are actually more logical views than physical containers
