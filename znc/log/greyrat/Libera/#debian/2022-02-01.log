[02:09:15] <Khepra> you could, if you wanted, take advantage of a fully installed debian host OS, with all its tools available to you, to partition and prepare the storage medium in wahtever way you want, and later install the OS atop of the already existing mountpoints. assuming the OS in question has such means of installation -- debian does, with debootstrap
[02:10:38] <mzajc> greetings! I have a bit of an issue with systemd-resolved; it does not seem to respond at all on 127.0.0.53 (which is the default listening address), and only over TCP on 127.0.0.54. I've dropped all iptables rules, set policies to accept, stopped opensnitch, and it will not work. wireshark shows packets being sent to that address, but no replies from resolved. curiously enough, this issue seems to be limited to these two addresses; specifying
[02:10:39] <mzajc> DNSStubListenerExtra=127.0.0.{1..255, excluding 53, and 54) and pointing dig to it (dig @127.0.0.1) will work just fine. pointing dig to .53 or .54 (latter works when +tcp is used) will result in a hang, so it's not a connection refusal either

[04:18:41] <Na_Klar> somiaj: I'm trying the xorg.conf solution to enforce the use of modesetting over fbdev, but I can't figure out how I get the "devname" for the Identifier line as well as the "pci:bus:dev:func" parameters for the BusID line (as far as I need this line). How would I find out the parameters I need for configuring xorg.conf?
[04:19:11] <somiaj> Na_Klar: modesetting probably won't work, if your driver is not kms aware this won't do any good
[04:19:20] <somiaj> do you do anything strnage like boot with 'nomodeset' option?
[04:19:39] <somiaj> I'd personally try the 'vesa' driver of 'fbdev', and it should take like 2-3 lines (you shoudln't need the BusID line)
[04:20:10] <Na_Klar> somiaj: So you think the modesetting driver is unloaded because it wouldn't work? maybe the fbdev driver is just loaded secondly ..
[04:20:46] <somiaj> Just something like Section "Device"\n\tIdentifier "mygpu"\n\tDirver "vesa"\nEndSection shuld be enough
[04:21:05] <somiaj> Na_Klar: that is exactly what xorg does, start with the better driver and moves down the list
[04:21:21] <Na_Klar> I see, so "devname" is just a custom string
[04:21:24] <somiaj> so it has already tried the modesetting driver, discovered it won't work and used fbdev as a fallback
[04:21:44] <Na_Klar> but xorg.0.log does not say it  failed, ist just says it unloaded it.
[04:21:55] <somiaj> Yup, really you could ignore that too, relaly just need the Driver "vesa" line (unless there are other options you need to tweak)
[04:22:21] <somiaj> That is failing for this, it doesn't want to spit out EE or WW just because that would be confusing
[04:22:44] <somiaj> this is the give/take for automatic xorg configuration, it is going to try everything until it finds something that works
[04:23:07] *** Quits: karabaja4 (~karabaja4@dh207-94-84.xnet.hr) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:23:18] <somiaj> but it will only error out if it can't find anything that works and it finds fbdev which kinda works, though vesa will probably be better (though a bit more software driven, might get rid of your artifacts)
[04:23:30] <somiaj> really you need to figure out the gpu/driver situation in the linux kernel

[07:02:12] <karlpinc> Since upgrading to bullseye my middle-mouse-paste has gone strange.  A paste of a newline into a terminal window does not result in execution.  I have to manually press the keyboard's enter key.  At that point the terminal will execte as separate commands the portions of the paste separated by newlines.

[07:03:17] <karlpinc> And if I work in a terminal window with the termcap set so that, e.g., the terminal has a width, as with, say, minicom, the past won't paste more than the first 80 characters.

[07:12:50] <greycat> It's called "bracketed paste".

[07:14:02] <themill> I actually quite like it, but I can see why others wouldn't
[07:14:02] <karlpinc> I see.  "man bash".  Why would anyone want this?
[07:14:28] <greycat> because it protects you against newlines in the pasted context causing the immediate execution of dangerous commands

[07:15:30] <karlpinc> Ah.  I see.

[07:17:19] <greycat> If you're inside minicom, bash is NOT INVOLVED.  Bash is sleeping until minicom exits.  It's between minicom and your terminal at that point.
[07:18:55] <karlpinc> greycat: But bash has done something to my terminal, or the mincom behavior would not have changed.  Reminds me of some sort of mode you get into after ^C at a password prompt.  I recall having paste problems then too.

[16:12:22] *** Joins: Metamorphosis (uid451146@user/metamorphosis)
[16:12:55] <Khepra> reinstalling a package _should_ by all means reinstate ownerships and permissions (except under /etc, those are conditioned and depend on options used).   Isn't that what you see?
[16:18:32] <tigerfoot> Khepra: With rpm I can F**ck a ownership like chown root:blabla /usr/bin/whaever and with rpm --restore it will just reapply the root:root ownership ... there's no replacement of the binary the inodes stay the same
[16:18:43] <jelly> also, debsums does not care about permissions, ownerships or extended attributes (like what setcap sets)
[16:19:10] <jelly> tigerfoot, that info is not stored in dpkg database
[16:19:13] <tigerfoot> I was looking for something similar in .deb world if it is more clear express like this.
[16:19:24] <Khepra> tigerfoot: so, again, doesn't dpkg /apt/  reinstallation do the same?
[16:19:28] <tigerfoot> jelly thanks .... I was afraid of that ..
[16:19:50] <jelly> tigerfoot, if you need to restore broken setuid or setcap, the thing to do is reinstall the affected package as said
[16:20:00] *** Joins: twobitsprite (~isaac.fre@107.13.51.62)
[16:20:09] <jelly> or restore from your backups.
[16:20:33] <Khepra> so we're talking past each other here :)
[16:21:05] <jelly> sometimes you need to explain something to user in terms THEY understand
[16:21:34] <jelly> or tell them why Debian does it that way, contrasted to some other distro
[16:22:31] <Khepra> so the bottom line, the act of reinstallation restores file properties, including post-inst steps,     except under /etc which is governed by separate rules.   ye?
[16:22:38] <tigerfoot> yes I know quite well rpm world, and I was surprised that something like this was "missing" in deb world ...

[16:23:03] <jelly> rpm, yum and dnf do some things better, and they also do some things worse
[16:23:32] <Khepra> I don't understand the nuance between reinstallation and "restoration" here. what's teh difference?
[16:23:32] <System_Error> guess deb never been trying to be 1 to 1 prm ripoff or something, they have different ways of doing things on some places
[16:23:52] <tigerfoot> Khepra: yes and no, because reinstalling like you suggest change its inodes but this can be ok for you ...
[16:24:09] <System_Error> Why software even have to bother about inodes?
[16:24:11] <jelly> Khepra, integrity checking tools can complain when inode number changed unexpectedly

[16:25:03] <System_Error> ahh, these... quite niche thing and they should complain on changes anyway
[16:25:03] <Khepra> I mean I use AIDE for taht. tracks everything. inodes, several csums, tstamps, perms, caps, ...
[16:25:10] <jelly> that's the opposite of moot, that's two wrong
[16:25:23] <jelly> you need three wrongs to make a right
[16:25:38] <Khepra> I mean, integrity checks would complain the same, so it's not an argument that <something> caused the complaint :)
[16:26:05] <jelly> Khepra, with rpm, they would not complain
[16:26:15] <jelly> not for inode numbers

[19:26:33] <Khepra> so I'll need, what a 1k burst or larger just to get _anything_ logged, and then subjected to the ratelimit?
[19:29:09] <Khepra> this is stupid. the burst is supposed to mean an exception to the regular ratelimit applied to the beginning of an event. if the kernel has 1000k entries slated, and burst is 10, I'd expect 10 logged, and then 990 supressed, and then 5 logged every second or whatever the ratelimit period is.

[20:34:56] <Khepra> blacked: as a general rule of thumb, I find debian's default boot processes quite fast. slowing down only when garbagepiles like gnome are added to the mix.
[20:35:23] <blacked> Khepra , so should i execute it `sudo systemctl disable plymouth-quit-wait.service` ?
[20:35:24] <blacked> if it wouldnt  harm my system removing it?
[20:36:15] <Khepra> err, no, you shouldn't disable that service. By nuking I mean removing the plymouth package entirely. does it drag out anything else when you remove it?
