[00:00:42] <chilversc> ano: yeah, part of your issue here is you're running into the "don't do that", and "you're doing it wrong" teritory, aka if you have to ask the maximum number of threads a process can support you've got too many threads :)
[00:01:08] <Soliton> you could also feed xargs smaller chunks that it can add up as it sees fit and call a script that puts together the final argument.
[00:01:33] <chilversc> likewise, if you're hitting the maximum argument length you're probably passing the data in the wrong way, unfortuntatly, if this is how the program is wrote and you have no control over it you're just sort of stuck in a bad place
[00:01:38] <ano> chilversc: still not see "how to doing it right"
[00:02:09] <chilversc> ano: the right way would be via a file, or stdin, but that would require the program to support it
[00:02:32] <chilversc> that way you don't need to try and cram large volumes of data into the command line arguments

[00:44:01] <Tahvok> First time using it - what does it mean?

[00:44:18] <emanuele6> that's funny
[00:44:35] <Soliton> printf %q would be clearer.

[00:44:46] <emanuele6> yes, in this case %q would be cleaner
[00:44:54] <Tahvok> So there is \r
[00:45:10] <emanuele6> printf 'content is %s' "${ping_answer@Q}"
[00:45:29] <Tahvok> content is ''

[00:46:39] <Tahvok> This is weird - now it's not being set again

[00:47:40] <emanuele6> again useless head
[00:47:52] <Soliton> same as shown there.
[00:48:17] <emanuele6> actually the head is doing something
[00:48:47] <Tahvok> Removed the head as in your last example. Now it prints the following:
[00:48:47] <Tahvok> content is $'+PONG\r\n'
[00:48:47] <emanuele6> because the $() is removing the seventh character
[00:48:57] <emanuele6> yes, just read a line, no?
[00:48:57] <Tahvok> Yeah, with head the \n is removed
[00:49:09] <emanuele6> why read -c7
[00:49:12] <emanuele6> it's just weird

[04:25:35] <phy1729> oh dear cthulhu
[04:25:55] <SJrX> Well the reason bash works, is because I wanted to use a json syntax and build json objects really easily and fast based on user input, with an intuitive syntax, so something like "foo 1 bar[0] 2 zebra.box[0].something 3" can build the json with nested elements really fast, but that ship has sailed.

[05:10:38] <emanuele6> there is no reason this should be like this
[05:10:49] <wikan> wiscii: here in readme https://github.com/psiversum/bashissue
[05:11:07] <wiscii> wikan: thank you
[05:11:33] <emanuele6> wiscii: do you know ${_valival@Q} ?
[05:11:35] <wikan> emanuele6, ok, so how you create variable like this?
[05:11:59] <wikan> didn't hear
[05:12:35] <wikan> i have no idea how to find anything about @Q
[05:12:46] <emanuele6> well, quotes are useless in this:   eval "argcmd_$_cmd=\$_valival"
[05:13:18] <emanuele6> and quotes here is bad    eval "argcmd_$_cmd+=(\"\$_valival\")"
[05:13:42] <emanuele6> oh, i see what you are doing
[05:13:48] <wikan> how it should be in your opinion? can you write it?
[05:14:13] <emanuele6> well, the array one is "fine"
[05:14:23] <emanuele6> the one with the variable is also fine
[05:14:34] <emanuele6> it's just confusing to read and i got confused
[05:14:48] <emanuele6> you don't need the quotes in the variable one though eval "argcmd_$_cmd=\$_valival"

[05:15:29] <wikan> well true i was regexped
[05:15:43] <emanuele6> no, not because of that
[05:16:02] <emanuele6> you have   eval "argcmd_$_cmd=\"\$_valival\""
[05:16:18] <emanuele6> but it can just be eval "argcmd_$_cmd=\$_valival"
[05:16:37] <emanuele6> because quotes are not needed in assignments and you are not injecting any code
[05:17:44] <wikan> i remember sometimes i get command not found when i don't use quotes in assignments
[05:17:55] <wikan> maybe i am wrong but i am almost sure i had something like that
[05:18:51] <emanuele6> then that means that _cmd was injecting code

[08:06:42] <emanuele6> i am surprised that bash has a recursion limit for expressions
[08:07:32] <ormaaj> only for math expressions.
[08:07:35] <emanuele6> but does not for prompt expansion; when i reported it on @bug-bash, chet said it did not need to be fixed
[08:09:00] <emanuele6> maybe POSIX requires a recursion limit for math expressions

[19:32:56] <Blondie101010> here it's NOT
[19:34:17] <John_Ivan> problem is, the respective channel usually contains people who branch out in multiple areas so there's a high chance I might find someone who may sit in spreaded out channels
[19:34:27] <John_Ivan> but anyway.
[19:34:45] <emanuele6> you only asked the question in #bash.
[19:34:57] <John_Ivan> only?
[19:34:59] <emanuele6> yes
[19:35:04] <Blondie101010> no he asked it in many channels
[19:35:23] <emanuele6> in the other channels you just said "anyone here know their way around ASTs in bison?"
[19:36:04] <John_Ivan> I don't think asking it differently will change the result.

[23:31:16] <jcbjoe2021> hi all i have a question, i have a directory with 17 subdirectories and lots of pdf and docx files in them, how can i use the find command to only go into the subdirectories and exclude the files that are in the main directory i was thinking find . -maxdepth 17 -type f , how does that sound?
[23:32:35] <boreas> What do you want to do with the .pdf and .docx files?
