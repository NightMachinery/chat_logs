[05:08:08] <zouhair> the last one
[05:08:14] <emanuele6> it does work, it is expanding a variable named `dice_' and a variable named `n' together
[05:08:29] <zouhair> I thought so

[05:17:00] <zouhair> ty emanuele6
[05:17:01] <emanuele6> it is a comment.
[05:17:10] <emanuele6> the "directive" is the shebang
[05:17:12] <emanuele6> !sh
[05:17:12] <greybot> sh is NOT bash; it is a POSIX shell. To run bash code, your script MUST use a bash shebang, and it MUST be executed directly or with bash (NOT sh myscript). Sometimes /bin/sh symlinks to bash, but you can't rely on this and it will disable many bash features. <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/Practices#Choose_Your_Shell>
[05:17:13] <Friithian> # Comment: a comment
[05:17:15] <emanuele6> !shebang
[05:17:15] <greybot> A script MUST begin with a #! line, called the "shebang" (from hash+bang). It tells the kernel what interpreter to run, to read your script. See <http://stackoverflow.com/a/733901/58803> and <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/CommandsAndArguments#Scripts> and <http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/>

[05:17:59] <emanuele6> oh, well
[05:18:13] <k-man> emanuele6: oh - I only just noticed it starts with #!/bin/sh and not /bin/bash
[05:18:22] <k-man> thanks emanuele6
[05:18:27] <emanuele6> k-man: either way, if the shebang says sh, only POSIX complaint sh code should be used
[05:18:38] <k-man> thank you
[05:19:02] <Friithian> POSIX complaint is overrated
[05:19:56] <emanuele6> compliant?
[05:20:19] <Friithian> I just typed what you did
[05:20:40] <emanuele6> interesting
[05:20:45] <kurahaupo> !#!2
[05:20:45] <greybot> A script must start with a #! and the full path to its interpreter. This is usually called the hashbang or shebang line. This tells the kernel what program to run your script with. Unless you are publishing your script, just use the direct path to bash on your host, eg #!/bin/bash but if you want to make a demonstration script to publish, see !#! instead.

[15:41:57] <tirnanog> what did, exactly? the above mentioned command had some mistakes.
[15:42:03] <kurahaupo> _val_: wasn't the point to report files that don't have ACLs set?
[15:42:22] <_val_> kurahaupo: exactly
[15:42:40] <_val_> but they all have. For example: /var/log/elastic-agent/elastic-agent-20220223140052  has ACL set
[15:42:41] <kurahaupo> So foobar is being correctly reported?
[15:42:50] <_val_> Yes. The rest should not be there

[15:43:13] <_val_> yes
[15:43:46] <_val_> So for example running: # getfacl /var/log/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.log-20211003.gz  I get: user:elastic-agent:r--

[15:45:15] <kurahaupo> Is there any difference in the way that getfacl and find -print presents the filenames? Trailing blanks?
[15:45:17] <_val_> Yeah I know I don't have the easiest questions
[15:45:28] <tirnanog> again, which command was executed exactly?
[15:47:01] <tirnanog> fine. ignore me then.
[15:47:56] <_val_> kurahaupo: http://sprunge.us/fW79Yn  this is what getfacl does:
[15:48:05] <_val_> tirnanog: no I am not ignoring you. You are being very helpful.
[15:48:43] <kurahaupo> _val_: That's still stripping the leading /, just not complaining about it
[15:48:56] <tirnanog> for the record, -printf is wrong and omitting -s would also be wrong. that is why I am asking.
[15:48:57] <_val_> So in the paste above you see foobar has no: user:elastic-agent:r--
[15:49:08] <kurahaupo> _val_: You need to arrange to omit the leading / from the output of "find" as well
[15:49:22] <maroloccio> Is this reasonable or can I do better? (using ASCII as a test)
[15:49:25] <maroloccio> # cd "$(mktemp -d)" && echo a > f && find . -type f -exec bash -c 'file --brief "$1" | grep "^ASCII text$"' _ {} \; -print

[15:51:40] <tirnanog> maroloccio: are you using file as implemented by GNU?

[16:03:32] <tirnanog> _val_: this one: http://sprunge.us/fW79Yn
[16:03:47] <tirnanog> here, it achieved the intended effect of not stripping the leading /
[16:04:16] <tirnanog> maroloccio: you may need to fiddle with the test against $type there. I'm not sure whether that's the entire string.
[16:05:03] <maroloccio> tirnanog: oh, I see.. so you are not fork()ing one file elf for each file but rather supplying as many args to it as possible?
[16:05:21] <tirnanog> yes. further, gnu file allows for the name and type to each be NUL-delimited with -00.
[16:05:37] <tirnanog> this is very handy for post-processing.
[16:05:52] <maroloccio> Which makes you save on calling grep just to pattern match too. I see.
[16:06:01] <tirnanog> that too, yes.
[16:06:06] <maroloccio> Why -00 and not -0?
[16:06:14] <tirnanog> -00 doesn't go far enough.
[16:06:19] <tirnanog> er, -0 doesn't, rather.
[16:07:00] <tirnanog> it needs to be -00 to ensure that both fields are verbatim and terminate with NUL. you may play with it yourself to discern the difference.

[22:31:51] <greycat> It sets up a bunch of stupid crap that hooks into bash's command_not_found_handle function.

[23:57:13] <agopo> Hi, I'm trying to write a script that restarts a spotify daemon. The kill -9 works, but not the restart. The new spotifyd isn't run it seems. Can someone help please? https://bpa.st/LWSA
[23:57:45] <greycat> !kill-9
[23:57:45] <greybot> Do NOT use SIGKILL (kill -9) to terminate processes. All processes will terminate in response to the default SIGTERM. If they don't terminate instantly, that's because they're busy cleaning up. If you interrupt them, you break them. See http://stackoverflow.com/a/690631/347411 and http://turnoff.us/geek/dont-sigkill/
[23:58:19] <Friithian> bad advice ^ SIGKILL has its place

[23:59:56] <agopo> greycat, so you advise me to kill -15 instead of kill -9 , correct?
