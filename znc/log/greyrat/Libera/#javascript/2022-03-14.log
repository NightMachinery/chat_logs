I think you are on the same page? or can we make things more simpler and smart than react yet not taking away the features react offers?

[01:07:23] <Flonk> So everytime I do `arr[1]`, the index will be converted to string, then parsed back into int?
[01:08:41] <Alexendoo> Logically that's what is happening, but the JS engine doesn't have to actually convert to a string as long as the result is the same

[01:53:04] <Flonk> Actually I've been meaning to look into immerjs, it looks like it makes state updates a lot easier and less messy

[01:54:21] <Intelo> ok.:)  thanks. see you
[01:54:29] <farn> Well, useReducer gives you reducers but it doesn't give you global state
[01:56:18] <Flonk> farn, judging by the mess my coworkers have produced with global state that might not be the worst thing :P
[01:56:41] <Flonk> Means at least you have to think about how you'd slice your state up into smaller parts
[01:56:45] <Flonk> But yeah global state can be handy

[05:33:39] <viva> hi all can someone help me understand what data type is being utilized in this example? https://jsfiddle.net/s46cnwq0/ -- i am a js noob and because js doesnt require you to define your primitive/data type, i dont know what this is... a map? a set? (an array?)
[05:33:59] <viva> i "know" its a key value pair (i think)
[05:36:24] <ThePendulum> that's a key value object, comparable to a hash map
[05:38:28] <viva> how do you construct it (if thats the right word) like if we were using sets, const mySet = new Set()

[08:14:18] <codebam> I would be initiating the websocket
[08:14:46] <codebam> telegram has a mtproto endpoint for their usermode API that they expose as a websocket for their web clients
[08:15:33] <codebam> so I would need to re-auth every minute or two using cron

[08:16:20] <deltab> why are you using something that can only stay connected for 20 seconds?

[09:05:36] <ljharb> supporting border-radius in IE was easy
[09:05:42] <ljharb> there was a VB plugin you could add that made it Just Work

[12:08:38] <theskillwithin> don't get your hopes up
[12:08:52] <lumberjack123> I don't really understand why they would add features to the language that the engines would ignore, could somebody explain the point of that?
[12:09:24] <lumberjack123> And how exactly would engines support both typed and older untyped code simultaenously?

[12:13:41] <lumberjack123> So this is just extending javascript engines to support other languages?

[12:40:12] <akissz> Hi, if anyone has a minute free, to answer a basic javascript question written by a programmer who does not use normal programming words/terms in my question methods so I write in confusing ways... I posted a question on StackExchange and people don't understand me there. Please view my question at:
[12:40:13] <akissz> https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/403554/multiple-jquery-inputs-or-binds-in-customizer-control-javascripts Thanks!!!
[12:42:13] <buu> akissz: Have you tried using the global window object to store data on?
[12:42:43] <buu> akissz: script_1: window.mydata = 42; script_2: let mythingy = window.mydata; ...
[12:44:00] <buu> Also doesn't .bind() take two arguments
[12:46:36] <lumberjack123> buu: what abut these features that typescript transpiler might also need to handle, not just types: Similarly, several features from TypeScript that generate code, such as enums, namespaces, and parameter properties, are being explicitly excluded "because they have runtime semantics, generating JavaScript code rather than simply being stripped out and ignored...."

[15:30:31] <mikrosis> hi
[15:30:53] <mikrosis> Axios handles HTTP status codes. Fetch doesn't. I need to differentiate between successful and failed request.
[15:31:01] <mikrosis> Can I still use Fetch but somehow handle those HTTP status codes?
[15:32:02] <han-solo> fetch provides a a response with `.ok` attribute, which is for success scenarios

[15:32:42] *** Joins: mintoyatsu_ (~mint@user/mintoyatsu)
[15:33:02] <stenno> Response has a .status field holding the return status
[15:34:00] *** Quits: mintoyatsu (~mint@user/mintoyatsu) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[15:34:00] <stenno> so you can still do stuff like fetch(...).then(resp => { if (resp.status === 403) { throw 'forbidden'; }...})

[15:34:23] <stenno> or just check .ok like han-solo said if you want to check 200/300 or not

[15:37:38] <stenno> would that be considered 'flow control'?
[15:38:17] <Maxdamantus> Normally when handling a fetch response, you'll do something for each expected status code, so you just throw at the end when the status code hasn't matched any of the ones you expect.

[15:39:26] <Maxdamantus> meant to say 304 there, but meh.
[15:39:39] <stenno> right
[15:39:50] <Maxdamantus> Doesn't really make sense to just do something for all 2xx status codes.
[15:41:04] <han-solo> `.ok` is specifically for scenarios like that, a POST could return 200 or 201 or others, both signifies success

[15:44:54] *** Joins: pmercado (~pmercado@186.107.61.173)
[15:45:07] <stenno> immediately i get the impression that react-query already translates 4xx-5xx to 'error'
[15:45:32] <mikrosis> stenno: one would think so, yes. but react-query gets a function passed that itself can use fetch/axios, whatever
[15:45:45] <mikrosis> when fetch throws an exception in case of error, react-query would be able to handle it
[15:45:58] <mikrosis> so I need a wrapper for Fetch that throws an exception for non-OK HTTP status codes
[15:46:12] <stenno> is 3xx OK for you?
[15:46:20] <stenno> 304 and stuff

[15:48:26] <mikrosis> lol
[15:48:28] <mikrosis> I see
[15:48:46] <mikrosis> how can I make it simple and as I want? Just check for .ok and throw Error if not .ok? How can I get the network/http error?

[15:49:23] *** Quits: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky) (Client Quit)
[15:50:12] <Maxdamantus> mikrosis: if there's a network/http error, `fetch` will throw.
[15:50:26] <stenno> i don't see a need for a wrapper if you can just chain a .then lol
[15:51:38] <mikrosis> Maxattax, stenno: right. But HTTP status codes that indicate an error won't cause Fetch to throw. In that case I have to check response.ok you said
[15:51:58] <Maxdamantus> mikrosis: or you can just check for the status code you expect and throw in all other cases.
[15:51:59] <stenno> or explicitely check response.status like Maxdamantus suggested
[15:52:12] <mikrosis> hmmm
[15:52:14] <mikrosis> yes

[15:53:00] <Maxdamantus> mikrosis: if you've got logic based on the status code, you *need* to do what I'm suggesting. And there's no need to diverge from that in other cases, because it's only like one line of code.

[18:50:38] <stenno> to be more precise, 404 is a _client_ error

[18:52:53] <stagas> ashnur: http resource errors are not the same as api errors. the http errors are used for client side caching, REST consolidates these and solves that ambiguity in theory, but if your api is a single endpoint then it shouldn't return anything other than 200 regardless of the payload content, that's my understanding at least

[19:25:09] <ljharb> ashnur: there’s nothing about http codes that says that’s what it must mean
[19:25:27] <ljharb> ashnur: it’s a fiction that “the server didn’t break” means it must be a success; that just means it must not be a 5xx
[19:25:43] <ljharb> ashnur: 200 means success, so, no kind of failure really.
[19:26:49] <ljharb> the flawed logic here (you’re very much not alone) is that status codes represent whether the responder functioned properly or not. The requester doesn’t and shouldn’t care about that; they only care about their conceptual request itself.
[19:28:00] <ashnur> ljharb, i think you are attributing opinions to me i don't really hold
[19:28:34] <ljharb> fair. The flawed logic in those who think that the only http code failures must be actual http failures, then
[19:28:52] <ashnur> i would totally agree that 200 means no failure at all

[23:00:55] <Maxdamantus> ljharb was just referring to something I said a week or two ago, which was about the premise of using HTTP status codes to denote abnormal conditions.
[23:02:16] *** Joins: KevinX (~KevinX@user/KevinX)
[23:02:34] <ox1eef> erlang's webmachine is pretty cool in that respect, it makes full use of status codes - like no other i know of.

[23:03:02] <epolanski> I don't think there's anything magical about any programming language and respecting http
[23:03:12] <epolanski> the http protocol *
[23:03:26] <stenno> oh i thought this was directly related to our conversion about status codes a few hour
[23:03:27] <Maxdamantus> in this case I don't think there is a suitable HTTP status code to return to say that the user has insufficient funds. It should be encoded in the payload.
[23:03:38] <stenno> s earlier
[23:03:41] <epolanski> really up to the developer to respect contracts, some libraries/frameworks make it easier or not
[23:04:09] <stenno> also i thought you were arguing that it doesn't matter if the info is in the HTTP code or in the body or somewhere else as long as it gets handled by the frontend

[23:05:42] <epolanski> very true ox1eef
[23:05:54] <Maxdamantus> In both cases I'm simply arguing that when handling responses, you should check for known statuses and fail in all other cases. That applies to HTTP status codes as well as statuses denoted in the payload.
[23:06:00] <epolanski> anyway about your problem Maxdamantus I think it also depends on the request
[23:06:05] <stenno> alright
[23:06:45] <Maxdamantus> The Uber eats response handling was obviously not doing that, because they were checking for a known error case and then succeeding in all other cases.
[23:07:26] <epolanski> I think a 403 is an acceptable response for this is acceptable, and so is a 200. http is about mapping resources to urls and methods, you made a request and you received the appropriate resource (the response for a payment) a 200 is okay, but is should contain the correct data in the payload
[23:08:00] <ox1eef> 403 would make sense to me as well.
[23:08:20] <epolanski> it's hard to discuss this imho without knowing what the request looks like, is it a get, a post, how the api looks like?
[23:08:56] <Maxdamantus> It's not clear: https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1503050864487014406

[23:09:17] <epolanski> every payment should be a transaction with some unique id, whether it has completed, refused, refunded
[23:09:48] <epolanski> like say you make a payment, and its a 200, it goes well, then the transaction gets refunded 48 hours later, should the response change?

[23:10:50] <epolanski> the status of the transaction changed, it's now a different (non cacheable) resource. imho a 200 is always a valid response, you need to encode this kind of information in the body rather than in http status codes, the 200 will only tell you if you got the information about the transaction, not its content

[23:24:07] <stenno> ouch
[23:24:20] <Maxdamantus> sort of like having an assume-faithful returns policy. if a customer returns a product, just give them their money back by default, rather than assuming they're trying to scam you.

[23:46:36] <austincheney> depends on the error.  HTTP status codes are only intended to describe the response status between the web server and the client, which sits before any kind of server application.  If the application is properly wired to the server then it should fail intentionally so the server can send a 500 class status code, but there are numerous reasons why that wouldnt happen
