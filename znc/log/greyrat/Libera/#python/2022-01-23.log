In this situation where the function can take an optional function as an argument, AND to prevent lots of tests within the function, a dud `fn = lambda x: None` is used. Yet flake8 doesn't like it. Is doing it like this smelly?

[01:33:58] <darksis> hello i have a little problem i get error about python and how i can fix the problem? https://bpa.st/3ZXQ
[01:34:16] <BrenBarn> it's not that big a deal in a case like that
[01:34:26] <nedbat> sveinse: you can put a pragma comment on that line to quiet pyflakes if you want
[01:34:42] <BrenBarn> like usually it doesn't make sense to assign a lambda because the point of lambdas is to be able to make anonymous functions
[01:35:05] *** Joins: Elodin (~weechat@user/elodin)
[01:35:06] <BrenBarn> but something for some dummy functions like that it can be nicer to write them as a lambda
[01:35:08] <nedbat> darksis: string.letters is in Python 2, not Python 3.
[01:35:14] <sveinse> nedbat: yes sure, can always exclude that check of course, but it was the smell I was curious about here
[01:35:19] <BrenBarn> so yeah I'd just use a pragma to tell the linter to be quiet
[01:35:24] <grym> sveinse: in general, i think named lambdas are smelly; in that example, i also can't think of a tidier way, particularly; so shutting up the linter is probably what i'd do too
[01:35:26] <sveinse> Thanks!
[01:35:27] <nedbat> sveinse: linters are dumb, people are smart

[01:36:03] <bjs> darksis: did you write that line?
[01:36:49] <nedbat> darksis: i think you are trying to run a program that was written for Python 2.  You can't fix it, because there will be other problems.
[01:36:49] <bjs> you may be trying to run a Python 2 program with Python 3, and that is unlikely to work (even if you fix this line)

[02:17:32] <apocalyptech> Mm, I assume there's no builtin str.capitalize() which *only* capitalizes the first char, if appropriate, and leaves the rest alone?
[02:17:49] <apocalyptech> str.capitalize() itself forces other words to lowercase, which isn't what I'm looking for
[02:17:53] <bjs> apocalyptech: does title() do what you want?

[02:19:09] <apocalyptech> Nope, looking to *only* ever touch the first char
[02:19:24] <apocalyptech> I mean, it's trivial enough to do by just slicing the string up.  Just feels like an omission is all
[02:19:36] <apocalyptech> I suppose it must not be a common use case.  :d
[02:19:45] <apocalyptech> er, pretend that smiley was ":D" instead.

[04:16:15] <foo> Quick poll: we pass a "context dictionary" around in our code (name context). It contains the user_id to act on, maybe an open API connection, maybe conf or user params specific to that user. We pass it around in Flask for frontend and pass it around in the backend. We have a "loader" module that "sets the context"... eg. ctx = loader.set_context(user_id=23) ... then we pass ctx throughout various functions
[04:16:21] <foo> and anything that occurs in this process occurs on the appropriate user. I'm surprised how many devs we work with who have never seen this. Can someone confirm that this is relatively common, to have a context class or dictionary?

[09:31:01] <Peng> dba: If you iterate over a string, you get the individual characters.
[09:31:11] <Peng> I'm surprised you didn't get a TypeError.
[09:31:16] <Peng> dba: For example, list('four')
[09:31:47] <jinsun> willow: that is not a function in that module, it is a method in some of the classes in that module
[09:32:21] <jinsun> willow: so import the class that you want, and create instance of the class and then call the method on the instance
[09:32:49] <willow> jinsun: yes i'm seeing that.  i'm trying to print out friendly versions of key attributes such as cert.subject and cert.subject
[09:33:15] <Repiphany> dba: `list1 += some_iterable` is the same thing as `list.extend(some_iterable)`
[09:33:35] <jinsun> willow: okay and what is cert?
[09:33:54] <willow> cert = x509.load_pem_x509_certificate(pem_data, default_backend())
[09:34:49] <dba> Repiphany, peng: so the += treat whatever comes after as iterable /??
[09:35:11] <Repiphany> For lists specifically, yes
[09:35:14] <cluelessperson> python trio rpc seems to support websockets by default
[09:35:21] <cluelessperson> but I want to just use raw tcp
[09:35:36] <jinsun> okay so rfc4514_string is a method inside the subject, you can just do cert.subject.rfc4514_string()
[09:35:37] <willow> cert.subject looks like: <Name([<NameAttribute(oid=<ObjectIdentifier(oid=2.5.4.3, name=commonName)>, value='example.com')>])>

[19:30:14] <alzgh> yeah, it does the converting to tuple/list under the hood Wulf. Yeah, s.pop() wouldn't be random as the set keeps the order of insertion if I remember correctly. Even if it didn't, it's biased toward the internal hashing algorithm and the bucket sizes etc.

[19:42:43] <jinsun> esther: because it probably converts to list internally with some arbitrary ordering, so you don't get any speed benefit, and it would give non reproducible outputs because the ordering can change with change in set implementation
[19:43:22] <ba> alzgh: dict/set? O(1) in most but not all cases if you have a good hash key
[19:43:29] <esther> the benefit would be not breaking packages that use this ig
[19:43:59] <esther> i don't use sets though really
[19:44:07] <esther> so ig it's fine

But it doesn't get installed to my PATH.  and I am not sure where the binary is either.  Anyone have experience with this?

[23:28:29] <stewie925> hi bjs - no I did not, could you refer to the line I might have unwittingly do it?
[23:29:17] <stewie925> my mock fundamentals are bad as you can see....
[23:29:52] <Wulf> mojtaba: I think re.findall iterates through substrings "hello", "ello", "llo", "lo", "o", "" and applies the regex each time. You can't have more than 6 results, len("hello") + 1.
[23:29:55] <Celelibi> mojtaba, this seems very much equivalent to '^\w{3,5}$'

[23:38:09] <df00z> nedbat: https://www.online-python.com/TYmI40wsr5  This is the jist of what I am doing.  Oddly my test case does not have a circular dependency.   Is there a better way to do this
[23:38:25] <bjs> stewie925: well when you run a Python file (e.g. by importing it) it has a name, the name of the file you run is called __main__
[23:38:38] <bjs> stewie925: e.g. if I go `python3 foo.py` the module is not called "foo" it's called "__main__".
[23:39:06] <bjs> stewie925: if you start trying to refer to something by the *name* of the module, then suddenly this becomes important.  It also becomes import if you try import using that name, etc.

[23:40:38] <df00z> let me try that
[23:41:17] <bjs> stewie925: so when you said "testingMock1.get_random_person" you meant the imported module not the one that was being run.  Which happens to be the same file, but is a different module with a different name.

[23:45:41] <Wulf> mojtaba: prove it
[23:46:03] <df00z> nedbat: When I separate the code into two files, and include eachother, I get the circular dep issue.
[23:46:09] <mojtaba> Wulf: B one time, A three times, N two times. BA, NA two times, and so on.
[23:46:20] <Wulf> mojtaba: I mean using re.findall
[23:46:35] <df00z> How do I avoid that?  C++ for example has forward declarations.   The coupling is required.
[23:46:52] <mojtaba> Wulf: put my regex in regex101.com website and try all the combinations, all of them matches.
[23:47:02] <mojtaba> I am not sure why it is not supported in Python!
[23:47:10] <Wulf> mojtaba: I assume they use some other regex engine
[23:47:10] <df00z> I can put them in the same file but I think it'll break if and when I start using type hints

[23:50:18] <Celelibi> mojtaba, on regex101 I get only one match that is the whole string.
[23:50:25] <Celelibi> What did you try?
[23:50:33] <df00z> It's truly a circular dependency
[23:50:47] <nedbat> df00z: you could also change line 19 to default types=None, and supply the list in the function
[23:50:54] <df00z> Facts!
[23:50:59] <df00z> That will actually work fine
[23:51:04] <mojtaba> Celelibi: Try to add BA on the next line
[23:51:09] <mojtaba> and other substrings
[23:51:11] <df00z> I didnt even think of that
[23:51:12] <ba> df00z: usually there's a refactor you can do, e.g. make it so that game objects aren't aware of the manager. You want a tree of objects, no a soup :]
[23:51:31] <df00z> They need to be aware because I'm using an observer pattern
[23:51:45] <df00z> so when you set properties on the game objects, npcs, they notify the manager to reindex
[23:51:51] <Celelibi> mojtaba, you can get a polynomial or even exponential behavior of the regex engine. But you can't get a super linear number of answers.
[23:51:52] <df00z> It's kind of a normal pattern
[23:52:02] <df00z> I need back and forward indexing
[23:52:19] <df00z> Otherwise i am gonna have to manage loops everywhere and doing it NOT as an observer pattern is a friggen mess

[23:55:20] <Celelibi> mojtaba, I try your regex: ^(?=\w{1,5}$)\w*$ I try the word "hello". I get a single match, as expected.
[23:55:25] <ba> df00z: gotcha. For type definitions you can just quote the value to do a forward reference: `def blah(observer: 'Observer'):`
[23:55:28] <silverdeer> Whats the best pastebin style code sharing site for discussing/running python code?
[23:55:35] <mojtaba> Celelibi: For example if the word is BANANA, try to enter B or BAN on each line and on the next line if you enter BANANAN it does not match because of the length

[23:57:11] <stewie925> bjs - I move the functions into a separate module  away from the testingMock.py  - but having the same problem mocking it  - https://bpa.st/5K2Q
[23:57:32] <silverdeer> I just started a new job and have to pick up Python really fast.  I am slightly confused. Coming from NodeJS background.  In this example-- line 9... I see map(function, iterable) ... but "str"? What is str doing there? it's not used anywhere else.  https://pastebin.com/vaKcEPkh
[23:57:36] <df00z> I cant think of a better way to manage this at the moment, this is clean enough and i can like find\replace later in the code
[23:57:55] <Celelibi> mojtaba, Basically, when there are several possible matches, the rule is "longest leftmost match". With variations depending on the implementation.
[23:58:00] <bjs> stewie925: is this your updated code? it still says patch("testingMock1.get_random_person")
[23:58:00] <silverdeer> Also, to debug this I guess I can just do "print <some variable>" to see what each step is doing
[23:58:21] <bjs> stewie925: shouldn't that be my_module.get_random_person ?
[23:58:24] <mojtaba> Celelibi: Yes, but I have the criteria for the length
[23:58:28] <stewie925> oh sorry
[23:58:30] <stewie925> hold on...
[23:58:31] <ba> silverdeer: the first argument of `map()` is a callable to apply to every element in the sequence. `str` is a callable that produces a `str` object, e.g. `str("10") == 10`
