[21:03:04] <mkulko> hi! i have a question about the fsf article titled 'Life's better together when you avoid Windows 11'. i agree that life is in fact better when you avoid using windows,
[21:03:04] <mkulko> but there is a statement in there that i disagree with. the article says that a TPM can strengthen encryption and user privacy when operated by a user. 
[21:03:04] <mkulko> however, from the brief research i've done, i think this statement is false. 
[21:03:04] <mkulko> even when a TPM is operated completely by free software, nobody can prove that the software inside a TPM is secure. 
[21:03:06] <mkulko> in fact, people have discovered several ways to attack a TPM (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module#Attacks ). 
[21:03:09] <mkulko> is there something that i am missing here? am i wrong? thanks, and sorry for the long message.
[21:06:05] <kompowiec> TPM doesn't work like outdated anti-piracy modules like dongles?

[21:10:52] <mkulko> kompowiec: i know, but how can the user be assured that the randomness that a TPM generated is true randomness and is not some kind of Dual_EC_DRBG-like backdoor?
[21:11:35] <kompowiec> you don't know this until you know how TPM works, which brings us to the obvious conclusions.
[21:12:49] <jxself> I think mkulko is looking at it from a different point of view than the FSF.
[21:13:47] <kompowiec> besides, people are emulating TPM en masse in their computer to run windows 11, oh irony.
[21:15:01] <kompowiec> jxself: POV FSF is universal - see Kerckhoffs's rule
[21:15:27] <jxself> The article isn't saying "your TPM has a good quality random number generator" or anything like that.
[21:15:33] <jxself> They even link to the article on Treacherous Computing.
[21:15:46] <mkulko> so, if i get an Infineon TPM chip, the only way to know that it doesn't have a backdoor is if i get it's firmware sources from Infineon?
[21:16:25] <jxself> So the whole issue that mkulko raises of "you don't know how good the quality of the TPM chip is" is a different issue and beside the point.
[21:17:56] <jxself> We can expect Microsoft to use the TPM for their interests, and against the interests of the users. They even go on about that in the article: "We expect Microsoft to use its tighter control on cryptography that happens in Windows as a way to impose more severe Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) onto media and applications..." and etc.
[21:19:01] <jxself> So what the FSF is really talking about is the matter of who should be giving instructions to your TPM? Who should it be listening to? Obviously it's better when your computer listens to (and obeys) you, not someone else. Regardless of how good the code quality is.
[21:20:07] <jxself> Arguments of that kind about how the code quality in it might not be good enough can't really defeat that point.
[21:20:26] <jxself> See the article that they linked to for more information https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/can-you-trust.html

[21:20:49] <kompowiec> > Who should it be listening to? 
[21:20:51] <kompowiec> always
[21:21:05] <kompowiec> this is the entry point of libre software...
[21:22:13] <mkulko> yes, but if the TPM's software isn't free, then how can we make sure that the TPM is listening to the instructions of the computer properly (which on a computer with a free OS would in turn give the full control over the TPM to the user)?
[21:23:04] <jxself> Obviously the software in the TPM should be free, as all software should be. That's also a different issue of what's in the article.
[21:23:55] <kompowiec> you do not know that. So in addition to being non-FSF compliant, you have an incompatibility with the modern view of cryptography.
[21:27:02] <mkulko> so i would be right in saying that until i build my own TPM from scratch, i can't make sure that anything a TPM does is secure, whether it is driven by gnu or windows?
[21:28:41] <jxself> Sure, but it still misses the point of the article as you're focusing on a different issue.
[21:29:02] <M6piz7wk[m]> did anyone called different issue? my summoning sentence~
[21:30:16] <M6piz7wk[m]> jxself: why have i been summoned
[21:30:47] <M6piz7wk[m]> fine ignore me i wasn't lonely anyway 💢
[21:30:55] <jxself> To my knowledge no one has "summoned" you specifically.

[21:33:28] <M6piz7wk[m]> -w-
[21:33:38] <mkulko> jxself: ok, thanks for explaining! its just that i feel that when ggoes says that a TPM can improve user privacy and strenghten encryption, some person might start using a tpm to secure their data, so that person can potentially start using unsafe encryption.
[21:34:14] <mkulko> .. i do completely agree on every other issue with w11 mentioned in that article.

[23:57:57] <Digit> some of the biggest fools have the biggest iqs.  consider perhaps, foolishness is more about wisdom than intelect.  do you have your wisdom quotient measured too?   and, i was not calling anyone a fool.  take up the issue with the programmers of erc for calling it that.  ... if my elisp-fu were better, i'd already have hacked up an alternative with user-choice number of increments of foolishness, rather than just a binary fool/not-fool,
[23:57:58] <Digit> which is at least a step better, as we can all overcome moments of some foolishness, but fool, sounds so much more set-in-stone judgement as if of permanent intrinsic state, and leads the mind to over-simplistic judgementalism over nuanced thinking.
