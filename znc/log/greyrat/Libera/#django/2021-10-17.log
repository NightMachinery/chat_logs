[14:02:33] <FunkyBob> ok, so everythiing except webchat works...
[14:02:38] <FunkyBob> and "webchat" is via websocket...
[14:03:05] <FunkyBob> not sure nginx would _need_ to know how to upgrade the protocol...
[14:03:05] <lazerlapin> yeah exactly
[14:03:25] <FunkyBob> https://www.nginx.com/blog/websocket-nginx/
[14:03:28] <FunkyBob> have you read this?
[14:04:08] <FunkyBob> [did you try making it Upgrade not upgrade? I know it "shouldn't "matter, but hey...]

[14:06:22] <FunkyBob> do you really want it settting Connecttion Upgrade on all requestes?
[14:06:36] <FunkyBob> then again, you say the non-WS stuff is working
[14:06:43] <lazerlapin> hmm yeah sounds weird to me too
[14:07:29] <lazerlapin> is the common practice to have different ports for websocket connections and regular connections?
[14:07:48] <FunkyBob> not sure, haven't tried it...
[14:08:02] <FunkyBob> have you looked at what django-channels and asgi recommend for nginx et al?
