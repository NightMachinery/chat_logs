[11:14:46] <hayley> Apparently everyone is doing a "virtual classroom" in Minecraft, but this is more sophisticated than jamming students into a model of a boring classroom.
[11:15:47] <hayley> So we are doing some sort of "competitive ranking" system for motivating people to study, but the idea disgusts me. The class should actually be interesting, and the students should find it enjoyable. Making students addicted to maintaining their score on a little game is no way to make a course any good.

[11:23:07] <hayley> Python is not a language in which I can UPDATE-INSTANCE-FOR-REDEFINED-CLASS, so I have to go indirect with these damn parameters, rather than being able to see changes to a program instantly. No fun.

[11:34:34] <White_Flame> (unless you have copy/paste functionality available through the client or terminal?)
[11:35:14] <hayley> It's certainly a weird take that deferred RC and hybrid RC/tracing systems are GC, but immediate/na√Øve RC is not.
[11:35:58] <White_Flame> GC/RC are taken as mutually exclusive in vernacular, even though RC is GC
[11:36:12] <White_Flame> GC vernacularly implies a separate garbage collector
[11:36:43] <hayley> Yes, gilberth is like that. But splitting RCs into immediate and deferred/hybrid is weird.
[11:37:10] <White_Flame> well, because they involve a separate garbage collector while being RC ;)
[11:38:45] <hayley> Not really. A hybrid RC system usually hopes to collect most garbage with RC, using tracing for the annoying cases (counter-example: ulterior RC uses copying nursery and RC tenured space).
[11:38:58] <White_Flame> tracing = the separate GC
[11:39:17] <hayley> A deferred RC system just doesn't count refcounts coming from the stack and registers, rather only updating periodically and "sweeping".
[11:39:40] <White_Flame> right, it's separate from the routine pointer handling
[11:39:58] <hayley> But, of course, deferred RC doesn't free objects as soon as possible. And it doesn't exactly trace (no "marking" which finds the transitive closure from roots).
[11:41:04] <hayley> Thus, if you're a weenie about destructors running as soon as possible [citation needed, but still], you probably don't like deferred RC.

[13:05:58] <hayley> But, also notable that some algorithms use RC primarily (CPython, RCImmix), and some use RC as a secondary mechanism (ulterior reference counting).

[15:45:17] <selwyn> hm, it doesn't play well with tmux, which is what i want
[15:45:30] <selwyn> but i had completely forgotten about ansi-term, thanks for reminding me
[15:45:48] <pjb> Or perhaps it costs less energy to can (liquid) butane than to compress air?
[15:46:02] <pjb> What the fuck!
[15:46:08] <Alfr> Can math even be effectively taught? I in my experience you can learn it by investing sufficiently time reading and solving exercises and at times you may have to quite tolerant to frustration.

[15:51:26] <Jacobis9000> Well the main thing was having someone to talk and explain things to me
[15:52:01] <Jacobis9000> I was struggling learning from books and Khan Academy, the former because they would often assume knowledge that I found to be missing, and the latter because it was such slow progress.
[15:55:00] <Jacobis9000> and I am the kind of person who needs structure, I am not the greatest auto-didact. It's not that I don't put effort in, but without structure, I don't do things consistently enough.
[15:58:08] <Jacobis9000> that was part of the reason I signed up for this computing and IT degree
[15:58:37] <Jacobis9000> it would give structure to my learning and let me stop having to think things like, "Have I done enough maths this week?" "I need to work more on project x!" etc.

[17:10:23] <Jacobis9000> I am reading about Haskell. It says it is 'purely functional'. I was given to understand that even functional programming languages require side-effects at some point otherwise there is no way to get anything done? Am I mistaken?
[17:11:02] <shka> Jacobis9000: you are not
[17:11:14] <shka> functional is very badly defined term
[17:15:29] <shka> Jacobis9000: what haskell understands by "functional" is lack of side effects, which is bullshit, because without side effects you don't have IO
[17:15:40] <shka> what haskell does is to allow to separate side effects
[17:15:45] <shka> and encapsulate those

[17:21:57] <shka> ok, how do i use PERF with sbcl?
[17:28:47] <sham1> Well, Haskell's idea of avoiding side effects comes more from how it views referrenial transparency, since if you don't have side-effects, a function given the same inputs will always give you back the same outputs
[17:30:09] <sham1> And thus a function invocation can always just be replaced by the computed value of the function, which could mean for example that the compiler could technically compile in some code that does automatic memoization

[17:38:12] <selwyn> i thought the side effects were contagious?
[17:39:47] <pjb> If they're associated with type declarations, yes.  But otherwise, you can confine them.
[17:40:22] <shka> if you are being careful, you can do that, yes
[17:42:13] <selwyn> remember talking to a haskellite who didn't believe me when i said that lisp wasn't functional
[17:42:19] <selwyn> he knew i use it every day lol
[17:42:39] <shka> well, "functional" is a very fuzzy term
[17:42:54] <selwyn> i suppose, but he probably had a reasonable definition of it
[17:44:09] <shka> hayley posted lecture when the term was criticized
[17:44:15] <shka> it was a good lecture imho
[17:44:43] <sham1> Well it is a rather nebulous term in a sense
[17:45:33] <sham1> At its base one could argue that it just means a programming paradigm with functions as first-class values which is somewhat unhelpful since most languages have at least some capability to do that even if they might not have full-on closures
[17:46:13] <rogersm> sham1: I like this definition. Even if many languages have functions as first-class values (like C), is uncommon to use them that way.
[17:46:28] <rogersm> To me lisp is multi-paradigm language with a strong functional component.
[17:46:43] <gilberth> Functions are not first class in C.
[17:46:49] <rogersm> but anyway, how we classify it is not so important.
[17:47:26] <sham1> Yeah, functions in C are separate from other values. The closest you get is with function pointers and even then that's not exactly the same
[17:48:01] <rogersm> In C they can be referenced and passed as parameters.
[17:48:04] <gilberth> That's not the point. You can't create new functions at runtime with C. Thus they are not first class.
[17:48:07] <rogersm> To me that's enough
[17:49:06] <sham1> That might change in the future perhaps, but yeah, for now it's not like that
[17:49:52] <sham1> Scheme(s) for example is more functional than Common Lisp in many ways but even then it's very different from Haskell, say
[17:51:55] <gilberth> Well, just because a language supports a functional programming style directly, does not make the language functional to me.
[17:53:05] <rogersm> oh that's correct. If the language has no culture of using that part, cannot be considered
[17:53:27] <rogersm> Scheme has amb, and nobody says scheme is a logic language
[17:55:19] <gilberth> Whether a language is functional or not shouldn't be a property on it usually (what is usually, anyway?) is used. It would not make sense to then talk about a language being functional, if that's the definition.
[17:55:51] <sham1> Well here we again get to the whole question of "well what does functional mean then"
[17:56:25] <gilberth> I would expect from a functional language that it has no procedures.
[17:57:08] <gilberth> Or as said earlier, I could always substitute the value of a function "call" with the call itself.
[17:58:49] <sham1> And so you'd expect a function in a functional language to be pure and side-effect-free since substituting a call with the value when the function has side-effects isn't all that possible
[17:59:17] <gilberth> The semantics of the program must stay the same, whether I say (f (g x) (h y)) or ((lambda (a b) (f b a)) (h y) (g x)) for one thing.

[18:04:26] <gilberth> Yes, and the initial LISP before it got the program feature PROG, was functional. Perhaps by accident.
[18:05:14] <sham1> Well if I remember my history it was basically a souped up lambda calculus for some theoretical stuff McCarthy was trying to do
[18:07:05] <pl> well, the legend about implementing EVAL being suggested by student in class is still around ;)

[18:11:04] <selwyn> it's not true?
[18:11:37] <gilberth> That even the EVAL given was supposed to run strictly sequential could be inferred by the short circuiting of the 'or' operator. (true or undefined) = true, while (undefined or true) = undefined. "undefined" here basically means "throw an error".
[18:11:56] <pl> selwyn: I haven't had a chance to verify for sure
[18:12:17] <pl> I did meet some people who might have been contemporary with it
[18:13:14] <gilberth> The EVAL function was thought as a theoretical device until one student was bold enough to just implement it. At least this is what I gathered.
[18:13:28] <sham1> Or so the story goes
[18:17:07] <gilberth> The PROG is funny, as it was different to the compiler and to the interpreter. The interpreter used evaluated GO. PROG would only accept SETQ and GO forms, and you would say sth like (GO (COND ((NULL X) 'DONE) (T 'LOOP))). While with the compiler its (COND ((NULL X) (GO DONE)) (T (GO LOOP))). The GO must go to the tail position (there is no other actually). A restriction which is part of the later Standard Lisp, still.

[18:30:07] <gilberth> Last time I updated my phone for some COVID app, the result was: The battery doesn't last as long as before, you need unlock the phone to just charge it, and the stock market overview got less informative. I can't see what got better. And I have my own hate against macOS. I don't own the machine anymore. With macOS 10.10 the machine still was mine, with 10.14 it's not anymore. Plus 10.14 is buggier in general.

[18:36:02] <gilberth> So there are files on my machine, which I cannot read, not even as root.
[18:37:41] <gilberth> shma1: That I must unlock my phone to just charge also is a security feature. Apple seems to be in a mode to mindlessly apply more and more sandboxing and/or walls to cache their buffer overflows.
[18:38:06] <Jacobis9000> I don't have to unlock my iphone to charge it
[18:38:15] <Jacobis9000> I just put it down on the magnetic charging pad, and it charges
[18:38:47] <gilberth> When I want to charge it with USB, I do have to.
[18:39:11] <Jacobis9000> Odd, I don't think that's a security measure but a fault.
[18:39:12] <gilberth> Just in case the computer sends a Trojan electron.
[18:39:17] <Jacobis9000> OH
[18:39:23] <Jacobis9000> USB2PC
[18:39:35] <Jacobis9000> I see, ok, well yes that might be a security feature then.
[18:39:51] <gilberth> Jacobis9000: I briefly googled the issue, and consensus was that it's a security feature.
[18:40:48] <gilberth> The frightening question is: What bugs are there lurking that they feel like needing to cache them in this way?
[18:41:23] <Jacobis9000> I think they're just protecting against repair cost due to unwary user action, probably.
[18:41:40] <gilberth> I don't care about my phone, it's just an expensive alarm clock for me. But I care about my machine.
[18:42:08] <gilberth> Jacobis9000: Repair cost? From what? That's likewise silly.
[18:42:37] <Jacobis9000> From people mucking around with their Macs, breaking them, and then claiming Apple Care? 
[18:42:56] <Jacobis9000> Mind you that's not going to be anywhere near a majority of users
[18:43:16] <gilberth> Yep, perhaps.

[19:45:28] <selwyn> is there a good reason for mission control to be in houston? or is just federals putting stuff in different locations
[19:46:16] <sham1> Probably the latter. It means that you need more nukes to wipe out all the things
[19:47:16] <Gnuxie> i thought it was because of radar station positioning 
[19:47:42] <sham1> Could also be that. The cynical side of me thinks that the station is also there for that
[19:54:32] <selwyn> radar station positioning?
[19:57:17] <shka> selwyn: there is political reason
[19:58:07] <shka> Eisenhower thought that putting high tech space tech in the deep south would help to solve some of the structural problems in the region
[19:58:41] <shka> there is also quite a bit of NASA contractors in the Alabama for instance :-)
[19:59:03] <selwyn> i see
[19:59:57] <shka> i don't know what it did for the southern states, but political infighting among the states is a very real problem for NASA
[20:00:22] <shka> anyway, all of that dates back to the Apollo
[20:00:37] <selwyn> the eu doesn't really make analogous strategic decisions right
[20:01:15] <shka> i think that Apollo program pulled a lot of young people into engineering, but not sure how many of them where from the southern states 
[20:01:48] <shka> well, EU never had something like apollo program
[20:02:28] <shka> and the existing international technological programs are getting split between existing corporations 
[20:02:40] <shka> vide Airbus or Eurofigther 
[20:04:33] <selwyn> thats what i mean
[20:04:38] <selwyn> they put stuff where it makes sense
[20:08:41] <gilberth> Is there anything to "typeset" diagrams, like box and arrow diagrams, from a textual description. Perhaps constraint based, like "place box A right of B", "place C so that it lines up vertically with A", and then "draw an arrow from C to A labels 'blah'"?
[20:08:52] <sham1> dot
[20:10:04] <gilberth> Whould it let me layout those things half-manually. And when I want to go beyond graphs? Like a box for bitfields within a word? A timing diagram? This sort of things?
[20:11:06] <gilberth> A part of a stack shown, a record, etc.

[20:26:31] <edgar-rft> German Wikipedia: Nordsee is part of the atlantic ocean...
[20:26:32] <edgar-rft> English Wikipeda: Nordsee is a german fast food restaurant...
[20:26:32] <edgar-rft> Dear english Wikipedia authors, where is your education gone?
[20:27:08] <sham1> Well it's understandable that it doesn't find the North Sea with Nordsee
[20:30:21] <selwyn> north sea is such a boring name
[20:31:49] <edgar-rft> let's compare McDonalds in the Scottish and the American wikipedia :-)
[20:32:03] <selwyn> there was a big controversy on the scots wikipedia
[20:32:29] <selwyn> it turned out that most of the articles had been written by some teenager in america who had never even been to scotland
[20:33:22] <edgar-rft> I only found McDonald (without the s) in Scottish context so far, otherwise I had posted links :-)
[20:33:41] <gilberth> Some also call the North Sea the West Sea instead. It's all a matter of your perspective.
[20:34:49] <edgar-rft> in prehistoric wikipedia you'll find the North Sea as Doggerland
[20:35:17] <selwyn> the lost country
[20:35:27] <gilberth> Prehistoric Wikipedia? On stone tablets?
[20:35:40] <selwyn> return to doggingland
[20:35:50] <edgar-rft> -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doggerland
[20:36:44] <sham1> Doggoland
[20:37:23] <gilberth> Was it flooded because of climate change? Who's next?
[20:37:35] <sham1> Yes! Actually
[20:37:56] <edgar-rft> Hamburg and the Netherlands will be next
[20:38:08] <sham1> The Netherlands is unsinkable
[20:38:34] <gilberth> Of course, it already is below sea level. Can't sink further.
[20:38:50] <edgar-rft> soon we'll have refugees from the west, too
[20:39:16] <gilberth> My plan is move east anyway.
[20:40:08] <selwyn> where to?
[20:40:28] <sham1> You know, east
[20:40:43] <gilberth> Berlin. When I am healthy again.
[20:41:19] <edgar-rft> east berlin? :-)
[20:41:35] <gilberth> Prenzelberg is East Berlin. Yes.

[21:52:47] <sham1> shka: nice
[21:52:58] <shka> yeah, this is the good part
[21:53:13] <shka> but input from CSV part is slow and there is little i can do
[21:53:27] <shka> because almost 70% of time is spent... in peek-char
[21:55:09] <shka> god damn you lisp IO
[21:58:49] <Catie> Is that something that could be fixed by slurping the CSV all at once and passing a string-stream instead?
[21:59:14] <shka> i don't think this would work
[21:59:23] <Catie> Ah, never mind
[21:59:45] <shka> i mean, large CSV files are a liability in it's own right so maybe i should not care all that much
[22:01:40] <selwyn> considering investing in an emacs book
[22:02:06] <ck_> which one, the one with an animal on the cover or maybe the manual, which is it spill the beans tell me quick
[22:02:34] <ck_> how will the value appreciate over time, is it like wine or maybe fungible tokens?
[22:02:35] <selwyn> the one with a bull on it
[22:02:42] <ck_> the bull yeah yeah great stuff
[22:02:53] <Catie> I've got a copy of it, I can't honestly say it helped me all that much
[22:03:00] <selwyn> there are actually three books about emacs with bulls on the cover
[22:03:06] <selwyn> and not all of them o reilly
[22:03:18] <selwyn> https://www.masteringemacs.org/book
[22:03:20] <selwyn> this one
[22:03:58] <selwyn> feel that learning emacs is a life skill worth investing in
[22:04:35] <ck_> sometimes I feel like configuring it is akin to making a card house
[22:07:01] <selwyn> me too
[22:07:11] <selwyn> partly why i feel i should know more about it
[22:07:39] <ck_> I tried that, but it's not all in the manual -- I mean some packages have their own ideas
[22:10:37] <ck_> or maybe I am just too lazy or inept, anything is possible
[22:11:21] <Catie> ck_: no it's definitely not all there. And the documentation really isn't excellent
[22:32:32] <Jacobis9000> So I have completed the emacs tutorial and got my head around emacs, I can now get the right buffers in the correct windows and it set up as I like it.
[22:33:04] <Jacobis9000> and I've been doing a bit of Lisp coding
[22:35:48] <Jacobis9000> I am really enjoying learning Lisp
[22:35:53] <selwyn> great
[22:36:27] <Jacobis9000> Having a REPL is so fun
[22:36:38] <Jacobis9000> You can construct your functions and test them straight out!
