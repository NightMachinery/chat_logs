[03:44:31] <lastshell> Hey guys I have a cluster and currently is increasing very drastically the number of pending tasks
[03:44:47] <lastshell> ES 6.8, what should I do ?

[05:08:38] <lastshell> any help will be appreciated I try to cancel tassk but ES said task doesn;t support cancellation
[06:02:16] <wwalker> lastshell: when I've tried to do that before, it is often because I was trying to kill a subtask, not the main parent.  Also make sure you are not trying to cancel a long running task, like xpack tasks
[06:03:50] <lastshell> well the cluster is in bad shape anyway
[06:04:34] <lastshell> seems like will stay yellow forever even after i put replicas 0 keep saying una shards
[06:04:46] <lastshell> for the indices I put replica zeros
[06:58:59] <wwalker> lastshell: things to look at:  disk space.  run a /_cat/shards  see if there is a pattern as to which shards are unassigned
[07:00:05] <wwalker> are you using SLM or ILM?
