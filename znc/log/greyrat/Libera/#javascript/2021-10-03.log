[01:11:29] <hakeem> on second thoughts, let's make this a learning experience... hassoon: the site you're currently responsible for (https://www.vneuron.com/) renders slowly and the elements jump around as I navigate page-to-page. This reduces perceived performance for end-users. I see you have only recently graduated and earned certificates in CSS, and expect this is
[01:11:29] <hakeem> a case of a man with a hammer seeing everything as a nail (with a sprinkle of narcissism). You can't replicate all the functionality of artsy/fresnel with CSS breakpoints. So you've been very unhelpful, rude, patronising, and on top of it you don't even no what you're talking about. Little wonder they're looking for a new front-end developer...

[05:40:38] <ljharb> `const foo: FormArray = ` is an assertion, because it fails if you assign the wrong type.

[06:01:45] <Maxdamantus> No. An assertion is something that the programmer claims, usually with the implication that it's not necessarily checked.
[06:02:05] <Maxdamantus> eg, Java and C have had something called "assert" for a very long time that works that way.
[06:02:29] <Maxdamantus> It allows the programmer to simply claim something, and depending on how the program is compiled, it might be checked at runtime.
[06:02:54] <Maxdamantus> It's not something that is checked beforehand, like a regular type constraint.
[06:09:31] <Maxdamantus> I wonder what Haskell calls the "::" syntax, because that looks similar to a type assertion in TypeScript but is really a proper type constraint.

[06:10:34] <Maxdamantus> imo TypeScript should have made `as` work like `::` in Haskell, and used something more explicit for the assertion.

[06:17:51] <ljharb> hm
[06:18:01] <ljharb> that is not my understanding of java and C assert statements
[06:18:06] <ljharb> certainly they don't have runtime behavior
[06:18:19] <ljharb> but i've never used a compiler that didn't check them, what on earth would be the point of that
[06:18:55] <Maxdamantus> They're usually not checked, but you can enable them such that they are checked at runtime.
[06:19:04] <ljharb> either way, in TS, using `as` is overriding the type system, and TS will pretend it's correct even if it's not. which is not how i understand assertions to work

[06:19:48] <Maxdamantus> The point is that you don't want to waste CPU cycles checking them in production, but they are statements that are useful for documentation, or for debugging, since you can enable them if you want (`-Xenableassertions` or something)
[06:20:04] <Maxdamantus> `-enableassertions`*

[06:21:15] <Maxdamantus> in C they're apparently enabled by default, and you use `-dNDEBUG` to turn them off.
[06:22:26] <Maxdamantus> 15:49:04 < ljharb> either way, in TS, using `as` is overriding the type system, and TS will pretend it's correct even if it's not. which is not how i understand assertions to work
[06:22:37] <Maxdamantus> It might be correct. It just might not be something that the type system is able to determine.
[06:24:00] <Maxdamantus> const circle = getShape() as Circle; // I know that it's a circle right now
[06:25:31] <Maxdamantus> theoretically you might be able to imagine a system where those type assertions are optionally checked, so maybe tsc could have an option for generating some sort of checks for all of your assertions.
[06:27:06] <Maxdamantus> (they wouldn't necessarily be totally correct checks though, since you can't ultimately ask if a value is of a particular type in TS, without solving things like the halting problem)

[06:44:42] <Intelo> certain programs give some error code intentionally. e.g eslint. that is caught by the CI e.g github actions that something went wrong. What is that error code and how to throw it if I want to make my custom thing?

[06:45:01] <ljharb> Intelo: what do you mean
[06:45:15] <ljharb> Intelo: shell programs just return zero, or nonzero. nonzero means failure
[06:47:11] <Maxdamantus> Intelo: maybe you want to use `process.exit(1);` in node.
[06:47:30] <Intelo> so when some rules of eslint are not passed, does it return non zero? ljharb
[06:47:35] <Maxdamantus> as ljharb said, the non-zero exit code is normally how a program indicates failure.
[06:47:50] <Intelo> Maxdamantus I see. yes, I guess.
[06:48:39] <Intelo> so if I do process.exit(1) on some commad that runs in github actions/ ci  . it will mark it as fail
[06:48:45] <Intelo> if so, thats what I want
[06:49:26] <ljharb> yes
[06:49:27] <Maxdamantus> Looking at the documentation, they actually suggest using `process.exitCode = 1;` instead, and making sure that you have no further tasks scheduled.
[06:49:41] <Maxdamantus> imo `process.exit(1)` is okay though.
[06:49:54] <Maxdamantus> https://nodejs.dev/learn/how-to-exit-from-a-nodejs-program
[06:51:05] <Intelo> Maxdamantus so which one to use?
[06:51:09] <Intelo> ljharb ok great
[06:51:15] <Maxdamantus> I would just use `process.exit(1)`

[21:57:50] <paulcarroty> I think we should take his finally lesson, life lesson, not Youtube.  Brutal, painfully lesson.

[21:58:53] <stenno> this channel is def. not the place
[21:59:07] <sillyslux__> do some programming or watch a movie

[21:59:41] <sillyslux__> or call one to come over to you
[21:59:54] <KevinX> Even questions like "why" are better answered by professionals. We're programmers. You wouldn't ask your therapist about sorting algorithms
[22:00:37] <Rockwood> i can't believe
[22:01:07] <KevinX> If you're feeling depressed, get help. If you're actually drunk, then understand that alcohol can make you feel 100x more depressed, especially when you wake up tomorrow.
[22:01:25] <sillyslux__> the answer to why is "his decision". there's nothing to it. this really doesn't help anybody. not you, not anybody else in the channel who wishes to not think of it
[22:01:31] <paulcarroty> distraction doesn't help, sadly. Go to therapy or get some self-help books.
[22:01:49] <efdee> go to therapy period. self help books only help their publishers
[22:02:06] <KevinX> the answer to "why" is probably more complicated than that even. Mental health is a sickness that you need treatment for
