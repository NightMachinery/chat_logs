[04:26:41] <Fenderbassist> I strongly prefer desktops

[04:27:22] <Sapphirus> Desktop computers are also more affordable to build yourself.

[04:29:45] <Fenderbassist> any idea what you want to get next?
[04:30:19] <Fenderbassist> you could use your RPi to do the programming while deciding on your next one

[04:31:08] <Fenderbassist> as long as the machine doesn't overheat
[04:31:22] <amigojapan> Yeah
[04:31:56] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: to hot is probably up to 40c
[04:32:07] <amigojapan> !c 40c to f
[04:32:08] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: 40 Celsius = 104 Fahrenheit
[04:32:30] <Fenderbassist> oh sure, I can totally understand that
[04:32:40] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: I think a CPU can be up to 80c fine
[04:32:46] <Fenderbassist> something like that yeah
[04:32:59] <Fenderbassist> I try to keep mine around 50c, since they're not doing that much anyway

[04:39:02] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: gl I look forward to hearing the results
[04:39:35] <MootPoot> wonder how much longer this protest is gonna last
[04:39:39] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: yeah but now I need to figure out how to use a computer in my house to begin with
[04:39:42] <MootPoot> I want some different news

[04:40:25] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I don't think protests have a time limit
[04:40:32] <Sapphirus> ^^
[04:41:03] <ButterNoodle> lol
[04:41:11] <MootPoot> well, according to the last poll they've already lost a lot of public support
[04:41:13] <ButterNoodle> *times up
[04:41:16] <ButterNoodle> protest is over
[04:41:20] <ButterNoodle> go home /s
[04:41:23] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, those public polls are misleading and often inaccurate.
[04:41:25] <MootPoot> I wouldn't be surprised for the RCMP to roll in and kick some booty
[04:41:37] <MootPoot> rules get bent when money is at stake
[04:41:45] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: yea ur communist in chief is pulling some shady shit
[04:41:46] * MootPoot shrugs
[04:41:49] <Sapphirus> It's very easy to manipulate the perception and interpretation of these questions and their results.
[04:41:55] <ButterNoodle> ^
[04:42:01] <Sapphirus> Most Canadians want an end to mandates, yet simultaneously they don't support these protests?
[04:42:03] <Sapphirus> lol
[04:42:03] <MootPoot> my solution to all of this is just to watch anime
[04:42:14] <ButterNoodle> yea that doesnt compute
[04:42:27] <MootPoot> ofc it dosent compute - you framed it dishonestly
[04:42:42] <MootPoot> they dont support the protests becuase its causing them fiscal harm
[04:42:49] <MootPoot> you dont have to have the protests to have no mandates
[04:42:50] <MootPoot> smh
[04:43:06] <ButterNoodle> just like there is supposed to be a trucker protest for the Superbowl in an attempt to smear and vilify the protests

[04:43:16] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, I didn't frame it dishonestly. These polls are dishonest for framing it in such a way to manipulate perception like so.
[04:43:33] <Sapphirus> These pollsters should be the ones you ought to be pointing the fingers at, because they're misleading people.
[04:43:39] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: yea let us restrict ur rights so we can give ur rights back

[04:44:41] <MootPoot> I guess if you want to say that - I haven't bothered to dig into the polls past the top layer
[04:44:48] <MootPoot> I cant confirm or deny it
[04:45:28] <amigojapan> MootPoot: tomako does not thinking forcing people to get vaccines that they don't want would fit in Japan
[04:45:31] <MootPoot> but all I'll say is that for some reason you seem to be attaching the outcome of this specific protest with removal of mandates, even though you can have removal of mandates without the protest being successful
[04:46:23] <ButterNoodle> I mean the saddest part is the Canadians were the first to stand up and sound off like they got a pair - the US apparently lacks the testicular fortitude to do the same, and we are supposed to be the loud mouth, opinionated, ass holes

[04:46:36] <MootPoot> or, in other words - you can have a burger without mcdonalds

[08:55:57] <Sapphirus> Here it's legal to possess a ROM if you own a physical copy.

[17:31:24] <teus> such as coffee
[17:31:51] <emmeka> teus I think I feel the most bad for the Haitians, based on that map. Poor bastards have spent the entire history of their nation getting fucked around by the rest of the world leaving them in the most miserable of conditions, now we've ruined their climate too
[17:32:02] <teus> coffee crop research is already working on cultivars that can handle the climate change
[17:32:46] <teus> climate change is inevitable anyway
[17:33:17] <emmeka> coffee is a crop of high tropical altitudes, the very rare highland climate in which humanity was born and in which arable soils aren't common.
[17:33:31] <emmeka> growing area's definitely going to shrink
[17:33:47] <Urchin[emacs]> AFAIK, Haiti is the only example of an enslaved underclass taking over
[17:33:52] <emmeka> but I'm less worried about that, than the fact that those areas are the prime vegetable producing soils of those countries as well
[17:33:59] <amigojapan> emmeka: won't it just shift area?
[17:34:04] <emmeka> Urchin[emacs] it's the only successful slave revolt in human history, yes.
[17:34:23] <emmeka> amigojapan shift area to further higher altitudes, of which there are less.
[17:34:29] <emmeka> and where there is less good soil
[17:35:10] <amigojapan> I see emmeka , is it possible to move top soil?
[17:35:27] <emmeka> that's... I'm just going to respond "no"

[18:02:40] <emmeka> Sadale well don't be too happy about it, if anything your country is the country on earth most likely to be nuked.
[18:02:44] <Sadale> It's gonna affect me in some way even if I'm not the one getting nuked
[18:02:45] <Cryowolf> Sadale, you'll still be in a nuclear winter and unless you're stocked up on very long lasting supplies, you're screwed
[18:02:55] <Sadale> yeah.
[18:03:15] <emmeka> if there's one nuclear power I trust the least it's probably Pakistan
[18:03:20] <emmeka> or Israel
[18:03:22] <Sadale> I still don't think that Russia nor US would be stupid enough to resort using nukes. I'd be more worried about countries like North KOrea
[18:03:49] <emmeka> I don't think North Korea's going to nuke anyone either.
[18:03:55] <JesseDesu> we dont know that
[18:04:05] <Cryowolf> I don't think Israel would use nukes because the one thing preventing a ton of countries from banding together and invading Israel is that they have the backing of NATO (incl the US)
[18:04:15] <JesseDesu> maybe someone will trigger a false launch
[18:04:15] <Cryowolf> they would lose that backing
[18:04:22] <JesseDesu> causing a real launch

[18:06:52] <emmeka> when was the Yom Kippur war
[18:06:53] <Sadale> I'm thinking, let's says, US and China are having a nuclear war. Would the US actually dare to nuke China considered that China's manufacturing so many shit that's used in the US?
[18:07:31] <emmeka> Cryowolf 1973, apparently.
[18:07:42] <Sadale> Meanwhile it probably wouldn't be wise for China to nuke the US as well because China's exporting so much shit to the US and it's profitable.
[18:07:43] <Cryowolf> I think that was before the US and Israel were as close knit as they are now
[18:08:15] <Cryowolf> Sadale, if China launched nukes at the US. They would respond in kind
[18:08:15] <teus> i think israel only has land based nukes

[18:29:05] <Sadale> when you said yuri before I finished watching the vid I thought that you mean yuri as in girls snuggles with each others.

[18:29:20] <teus> of course
[18:29:50] <Bco1981> what else would it be?
[18:30:10] <teus> Yuri is a name
[18:30:14] <teus> Joeri
[18:31:39] <Sadale> Russian people name
[18:31:42] <Bco1981> en subtitls call him jerry

[18:31:55] <teus> yuri gagarin

[18:32:41] <teus> pretty fascinating
[18:32:57] <Bco1981> when it's the russian accent speaking*
[18:33:08] <teus> pretty horrible and dumb accidents with it
[18:33:19] <teus> or an explosion leaving 2 dead staffers

[18:34:30] <Urchin[emacs]> even if screwdrivers aren't involved
[18:34:57] <teus> and most russian accidents are because of cost cutting, rushing development and a total lack of respect for human life
[18:35:10] <Urchin[emacs]> or random guy finds something random
[18:35:24] <teus> good old communism

[18:41:07] <Urchin[emacs]> the company that was required to do the disposal took a portion of them and dumped them in an illegal dump site (that's illegal to dump anything there) in an unlined quarry, next to a river
[18:41:11] <teus> thats very nice

[18:48:18] <teus> i shot film before digital was any good, or photography was a hype
[18:48:24] <teus> i havent photographed for 2 years with covid
[18:48:24] <ezekielnoob> i would love to try a leica but it's not gonna give me better results
[18:48:26] <JesseDesu> same
[18:48:31] <ezekielnoob> it's more for the experiencme of shooting it
[18:48:33] <teus> and barely any since i ditched a lot of people in my life
[18:48:47] <JesseDesu> there was a thing called bracketing
[18:49:03] <JesseDesu> now we have raw format
[18:49:10] <JesseDesu> pretty much anything is correctable
[18:49:13] <teus> nope
[18:49:22] <teus> not like that
[18:49:35] <teus> depends how good your camera is, how demanding you are, and how demanding the scene is

[18:49:56] <teus> i am

[19:17:20] <Poeticode> Sadale much hairier
[19:17:26] <Sadale> TIL
[19:17:52] <Sadale> Makes me wonder how Urchin[emacs] even learned about that considered that he's (presumably) a virgin
[19:18:21] <Sadale> internet I guess.
[19:18:25] <teus> women are probably more sensitive about it too
[19:18:34] <Sadale> Interesting. :O
[19:18:59] <ezekielnoob> Sadale yeah :p
[19:19:07] <ezekielnoob> not as great as i thoguht it would be
[19:19:29] <teus> depends how she's into it
[19:19:29] <ezekielnoob> porn does lie
[19:19:30] <Sadale> I guess butt's tighter than pussy?
[19:19:37] <teus> plenty of women try anal.. only once D:
[19:19:59] <ezekielnoob> yes it is but... the cavity isn't that deep
[19:20:06] <ezekielnoob> it's like an open space after a few inches
[19:20:55] <ezekielnoob> i don't know how else to describe it
[19:21:06] <MootPoot> isk I know male butt is hairy
[19:21:15] <MootPoot> I mean, I scratch my own ass all the time
[19:21:15] <MootPoot> :3
[19:21:35] <Sadale> It reminds me that there was a Chinese couple who failed to conceive. They did lab test and shit and found that they're actually able to have a baby. And when they get back home to have sex they still failed to conceive. After quite a while, they've realized that the husband's fucking the wrong hole. That's why the wife wasn't able to get pregnant.
[19:21:44] <MootPoot> LOL
[19:21:47] <MootPoot> I remember that story
[19:21:47] <Sadale> MootPoot, I know that too. But I didn't know that the female one's less hairly
[19:21:53] <ezekielnoob> Sadale kind of crazy
[19:21:58] <MootPoot> buttseks
[19:22:00] <ezekielnoob> the holes are really close tho
[19:22:17] <ezekielnoob> but why doens't the wife realize it
[19:22:27] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, crazy indeed. If this hole doesn't work, why wouldn't the man try the other one?
[19:22:36] <Sadale> Probably lack of sex ed?
[19:23:38] <teus> of course
[19:23:47] <teus> some do it up the butt, others in the peehole

[20:40:08] <MootPoot> oh wait
[20:40:08] <Bco1981> install a linux distro
[20:40:11] <MootPoot> I can watch anime
[20:40:30] <MootPoot> I still dont know how to completely install arch solo
[20:40:35] <MootPoot> I get some of it but
[20:40:39] <MootPoot> idk
[20:41:14] <isekaijin> Why remember all the steps when you can always read the guide? It's good to know what the steps are doing, but... actually memorizing all of them?
[20:41:33] <MootPoot> well
[20:41:36] <MootPoot> that's not the problem
[20:41:49] <MootPoot> the problem with the guide is that it always assumes everything is perfectly setup
[20:41:57] <MootPoot> and somehow I always run into all the edge cases
[20:42:10] <MootPoot> and I dont have the surronding knowledge to dig myself out of that hole
[20:42:16] <isekaijin> I've never had any problems with the guide. But can always try it in a virtual machine.
[20:42:27] <isekaijin> But I'm sure there are more interesting things to do than ‚Äúlearn how to install another operating system‚Äù.
[20:42:27] <MootPoot> on real machines , for example
[20:43:01] <MootPoot> sometimes boot partition wont be setup right, sometimes the other partitions are borked, sometimes its a MBR/GPT thing, sometimes its a weird bios/UEFI thing
[20:43:03] <MootPoot> idfk
[20:43:12] <Bco1981> only issue i had with arch was the not so obvious disk type when launching fdisk/cfdisk for the first time.
[20:43:14] <MootPoot> I just suck off butter till be helps me
[20:43:29] <MootPoot> still havent fixed my windows key problem
[20:43:36] <isekaijin> Windows key problem?
[20:43:43] <Bco1981> by chosing the wrong type, grub won't work  when you finish the install and try to boot.
[20:44:47] <MootPoot> Pressing the windows key won't open the application finder in KDE plasma and for some reason trying to edit my shortcuts fails on saving 
[20:44:57] <MootPoot> Not the end of the world but 
[20:44:59] <MootPoot> Meh
[20:45:00] <isekaijin> Bco1981: I just use systemd-boot, because that seems to be what the distro's maintainers wish you would use, and I have neither the time nor the energy to argue about bootloader choices.
[20:45:26] <Bco1981> i just picked grub because i know that one.
[20:45:47] <Bco1981> in combination with gpt disk type... did not work.
[20:46:03] <isekaijin> But then, there are people who are more heavily invested ini their old bootloaders / init systems / whatever, and that's totally fine too.
[20:46:25] <MootPoot> Aside from that, I guess this computer is just a bit slow 
[20:46:32] <MootPoot> But I can deal with 5hay
