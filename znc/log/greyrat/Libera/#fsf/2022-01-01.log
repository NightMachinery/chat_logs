[01:36:36] <Kaiod> Hello everyone, I'm coming here quickly, to wish a good end of the year to everyone! 
[01:36:36] <Kaiod> We are going through a complex time in 2021, and I think this is a time of global learning. Even though it is a difficult time for humanity, we have managed to handle this storm, and can look forward to better days.
[01:36:36] <Kaiod> In the free software movement, specifically the FSF, in my opinion there have been many improvements compared to recent times, and this is cause for celebration. I hope that the foundation will think more about how to work with its activists, how to engage them in their agendas, and how to better serve the desires and problems that the community brings.
[01:38:10] <Kaiod> I hope that in 2022, we can be together in the fight for free software and user freedom days. A good end of the year to everyone!
[01:38:43] <nully> I mean if 2021 is your standard for a good year, sure I guess?

[03:32:05] <duik> I've been reading some posts and articles from so called security experts who claim that gnu/linux has terrible security compared to proprietary operating systems like windows and macOS. 
[03:32:05] <duik> Daniel Micay from GrapheneOS even claims that gnu/linux is a decade or more behind on security as a desktop OS at least. He's planning to move to another kernel which is not gnu/linux, when possible. Is it true that gnu/linux only provides more privacy at the cost of security?
[03:32:43] <duik> Another kernel not linux*
[03:33:20] <White_Flame> you'd have to define privacy & security here
[03:33:38] <White_Flame> privacy of who from whom, etc
[03:33:55] <GNUHacker> Happy GNU year!
[03:34:04] <White_Flame> and as far as "operating system security", I doubt they mean solely the kernel
[03:34:18] <DiffieHellman> Sad GNU year.
[03:34:20] <White_Flame> but rather include default configs, running services, etc
[03:34:42] <White_Flame> or they could just mean something as stupid as not having any anti-virus built in
[03:34:45] <duik> I know it's really difficult to protect yourself from state actors. So security and privacy mainly from malicious non-state actors
[03:34:52] <DiffieHellman> duik: A lot of these "security studys" are based off little more than the CVE count.
[03:35:24] <gustaf> free software can be more secure, but just the fact that it's free software doesn't guarantee that 
[03:35:30] <White_Flame> duik: I meant something more technically quantifiable
[03:35:30] <DiffieHellman> GNU programs are Linux are free software, and plenty of people find bugs, report CVE's and then fix those bugs.
[03:36:14] <DiffieHellman> For bugs in proprietary OS's, they give them to the NSA first and then they get around to fixing it eventually. It's probably rare for a bug to be assigned a CVE.

[03:37:05] <DiffieHellman> Windows is swiss cheese security wise, so if you want _any_ security, do *not* use windows.
[03:38:03] <duik> For example I read that xorg is very insecure because it allows any program to see everything you type. I read that windows and macos have better isolation of programs and even sandboxing in Linux like flatpaks and snaps can't compete with that
[03:38:41] <DiffieHellman> Yes, but the Xorg problem is best solved by just not running proprietary malware on your machine.
[03:39:03] <DiffieHellman> If all your run is free software, and none of those free software problems keylog you, you're good.
[03:40:16] <duik> But most computers today need proprietary software to work properly. Even for basic functionality
[03:40:45] <DiffieHellman> Windows and macOS has pretty shoddy sandboxing in my option. While I believe you can't trivially keylog or access other programs, there's plently of attack surface around in the sandbox to get what you want.
[03:41:26] <DiffieHellman> The proprietary software running on the hardware is a problem, but it's going to get you exactly the same if applications are in sandboxes or not/.
[03:41:41] <duik> And programs on gnu/linux normally have access to the complete filesystem which they find also problematic
[03:41:52] <duik> Or at least home
[03:42:02] <White_Flame> uh
[03:42:08] <White_Flame> yeah windows is way worse in that aspect
[03:42:47] <DiffieHellman> Users can only access files with everyone permissions, or files under users and groups
[03:42:49] <White_Flame> especially as many applications set up as servers run as their own user
[03:43:24] <DiffieHellman> If you don't want a program looking through your home directory, you can launch it under a different user, with no permission to view your homedir.
[03:43:24] <White_Flame> I think you'd do better to learn systems more, rather than take others' rumors
[03:43:29] <DiffieHellman> ^
[03:43:38] <White_Flame> and again, security is a collection of very specific situations/risks
[03:43:54] <White_Flame> and intersects with the expected use cases
[03:44:03] <DiffieHellman> With windows, the typical security model is; you can't do anything, or you can do everything (admininstrator).
[03:44:05] <White_Flame> (a perfectly secure system lets you do nothing, which doesn't really apply to most personal computers)
[03:44:36] <White_Flame> s/you do nothing/nobody do anything/
[03:45:03] <White_Flame> it's all about wrangling the intent of behaviors
[03:45:07] <DiffieHellman> On GNU/Linux, you can set fine grained permissions for every user - you don't need to run as (effectively) root to do anythiong.
[03:45:44] <duik> Ok, thanks for your insights
[03:46:01] <DiffieHellman> Security on a personal computer is all about both having a okay security base and *looking* like you have more security than you do.
[03:47:25] <DiffieHellman> You can't do much about nation states, but you can make 99% of attackers give up and move on.
[03:48:37] <White_Flame> well, there's a difference between nation state surveillance, and a nation state directly targeting you, too
[03:48:43] <DiffieHellman> Yup.
[03:48:44] <White_Flame> the latter of which you're not going to win
[03:48:59] *** Quits: isf (~iShareFre@user/isharefreedom) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:50:06] <DiffieHellman> You're most likely not going to win if a nation state directly targets you, but if you prepare for 10 years and make no mistakes, you have a small chance (too bad preparing at this level will probably make the nation state target you, which is a bit counter intuative).
[03:50:07] <White_Flame> firewall + good browser/email discipline + good install discipline gets you many 9s there

[03:53:57] <DiffieHellman> Yes, it is the common case.
[03:54:53] <DiffieHellman> Tor'ng everything and running _all_ the meshnets over the clearnet connection is a nice solution of course.
[03:56:23] <White_Flame> yep.  I don't expect any VPN to be useful for privacy.  They're just being advertised & sold as geofencing avoidance anyway

[03:57:57] <DiffieHellman> Ah, you were referring to anyone else reading.
[03:58:34] <DiffieHellman> VPN's are kinda worse for snooping, as a VPN is slightly more likely to comply with an illegal governmental request than an ISP.
[03:58:46] <White_Flame> it always annoys me when I watch some videos or whatever and VPN companies are always advertise there.  Like, why not just use tor?
[03:59:20] <DiffieHellman> Tor only transports TCP streams. Tor can't do UDP, which is good for stuff like videos.
[03:59:48] <DiffieHellman> Tor browser is the solution when it comes to web browsing though.
[04:01:10] <DiffieHellman> VPN's are effective when it comes to bittorrent, as any copyright trolls have to go to the VPN first, and if you get the right VPN and don't give your details (i.e. via credit card payment), the VPN doesn't have much to give.

[04:11:10] <duik> Do you regard snaps by canonical to be proprietary? Are flatpaks better in terms of freedom?
[04:11:38] <natewrench123456> well if the snaps are under a free software open source license then no
[04:11:47] <DiffieHellman> Snaps and flatpacks aren't interitely proprietary, as both are built on free software.
[04:12:14] <DiffieHellman> Canonical loves shoving proprietary software into snaps I believe.
[04:12:23] <natewrench123456> firefox snap is still a free snap
[04:12:29] <natewrench123456> MPlv2/GPLv3
[04:12:30] <duik> Isn't the snap backend proprietary? There's only one snap store from canonical 
[04:12:44] <duik> And there can only be one
[04:12:53] <natewrench123456> heh the highlander store
[04:13:11] <DiffieHellman> You can always just download snap files, they don't need a store.
[04:13:48] <natewrench123456> That Luca Bonissi still profited 5.000 euros
[04:14:02] <duik> Yes 
[04:14:19] <DiffieHellman> Snaps and flatpacks are a poor workaround to actually fixing your build system and libraries - you can just ship all your required old library's (i.e. with known exploits) with your binary.
[04:15:13] <natewrench123456> FreeOrion works under snap
[04:15:17] <DiffieHellman> The real solution is to handle packging correctly, by having the package manager compile everything from source, ensuring to link with the newest versions of each libraries.
[04:15:28] <akonai> guix is a better solution than snaps or flatpaks
[04:15:37] <natewrench123456> guix os?
[04:15:39] <duik> Their main purpose is, if I understand correctly, that they work on most gnu/linux distributions
[04:15:51] <DiffieHellman> Proprietary software usually can't have this, as all you get is a binary usually, so a snap or whatever with exact library versions is required. 
[04:15:54] <akonai> guix package manager
[04:16:10] <DiffieHellman> Guix is okay, but I prefer portage on Gentoo-libre myselj.
[04:16:21] <natewrench123456> but you can still request source, i mean source available
[04:18:08] <DiffieHellman> duik: Yes, they work on most GNU/Linux distro's, as they ship most required binaries. Static linking is a mistake though.
[04:18:22] <DiffieHellman> *libraries
[04:18:46] <natewrench123456> the Mozilla public license is a static linking license
[04:19:13] <DiffieHellman> 3>snapcraft.io advertises the proprietary spotify on the main page
[04:19:31] <natewrench123456> well dont generalize snap based on spotify
[04:19:55] <natewrench123456> debian has nonfree repos
[04:19:59] <DiffieHellman> I generalize things based off how easily proprietary software is slipped in.
[04:20:09] <duik> Flathub (flatpaks main repo) has proprietary software as well
[04:20:14] <DiffieHellman> Yup.
[04:20:22] <DiffieHellman> At least Debian doesn't enable the proprietary repo by default.
[04:20:24] <akonai> i feel like flatpaks are mostly pushed by redhat as a simple way of distributing proprietary software. similarly with snaps on ubuntu. there's almost no reason to use flatpaks over a native package manager besides edge cases like running a different libc 
[04:20:47] <DiffieHellman> That's pretty much it.
[04:21:02] <DiffieHellman> Any program that's in a snap or flatpack is poorly packagend
[04:21:42] <duik> The problem is that appimages can't be updated
[04:22:15] <natewrench123456> appimages run in a sandbox
[04:22:31] <DiffieHellman> Yup, you have to wait until the developer gets around to updating any libraries and then eventually shipping the whole prgram as an update.
[04:22:38] <DiffieHellman> The appimage sandbox is very poor tbh
[04:23:25] <natewrench123456> hmm maybe we need a faster interpreter to run updated code
[04:23:40] <DiffieHellman> Why use an interpreter at all?
[04:23:54] <DiffieHellman> Compile to machine code.
[04:24:11] <duik> But wouldn't a single binary form for all gnu/linux distros be a good thing? Developers won't need to make different binaries for different distros
[04:24:20] <natewrench123456> maybe invest in a decompiler or disassembler
[04:24:47] <natewrench123456> duik, if the binary form could print out its own source code that would help build trust
[04:24:49] <DiffieHellman> duik: Since if you do that, every program is 100MiB+ and is full of vulnerable outdated libraries.
[04:25:21] <akonai> developers don't need to make any binaries in the first place though. 
[04:25:27] <natewrench123456> trying to find software that is on debian to run on fedora is difficult
[04:25:36] <DiffieHellman> Developers need to use a decent build system for their source code (like a makefile), so every distro can just compile the source and release it as a binary without an issue.
[04:25:43] <natewrench123456> i used alien i think to convert the DEBS to RPMS
[04:28:52] <duik> Is AGPL better than GPLv3? Can it completely replace it?
[04:29:03] <natewrench123456> well no its an honor system license
[04:29:54] <natewrench123456> if i violate the gpl, theres no terms that the looser pays all court costs
[04:30:00] <duik> But GPLv3 doesn't prevent the software from being used on servers, am I right?
[04:30:06] <DiffieHellman> duik: AGPLv3 adds one addittional clause in that if you host the software on a network accessible server, you need to make the source available under the AGPLv3 from the same server.
[04:30:48] <natewrench123456> DiffieHellman, why doesnt google use AGPL for their intranet?
[04:30:52] <DiffieHellman> If you use GPLv3 on a server and make it network connectable, providing the source under the same license isn't required, as that's not distribution under the GPLv3's definition.
[04:31:08] <akonai> google hates AGPL iirc
[04:31:14] <duik> Why doesn't AGPLv3 be called GPLv4? 
[04:31:25] <Noisytoot> because it doesn't replace the GPLv3
[04:31:28] <DiffieHellman> natewrench123456: Google wants to turn things proprietary, so they don't like using GPLv3 and then don't allow AGPLv3 at all.
[04:31:57] <DiffieHellman> duik: Since it adds one extra requirement that only makes sense for programs that are generally ran on a networking serever.
[04:32:22] <DiffieHellman> AGPLv3 and GPLv3 are compatible, provided all requirements are met btw
[04:32:53] <duik> But having an extra clause won't hurt? Any program could also be run on a server one day
[04:33:01] <duik> Bett
[04:33:31] <natewrench123456> Apple does release stuff under LGPL which is fine
[04:33:36] <DiffieHellman> It might hurt in quite rare cases, and if it doesn't, you can use the AGPLv3.
[04:33:59] <DiffieHellman> Appel hates freedom though, and they often decide to stop releasing things.
[04:34:19] <duik> So I can basically use AGPLv3 for all use cases?
[04:34:29] <natewrench123456> duik, if you can enforce it
[04:35:24] <natewrench123456> duik, if you cannot reasonably enforce the terms i suggest you transfer your copyright to the FSF and have them deal with enforcement

[04:41:40] <natewrench123456> "Brave is made available to you under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL) and includes open source software under a variety of other licenses. You can read instructions on how to download and build for yourself the specific source code used to create this copy."

[04:42:25] <natewrench123456> Now palemoon is bad feeling
[04:42:36] <duik> Braver was a fork without the crypto "features" but was purged due to trademark issues I guess
[04:42:55] <natewrench123456> duik, hmm yea but if they change the name they would be compliant
[04:44:16] <DiffieHellman> "Braver" was deemed to infringe the trademark, so it was renamed to bold; https://github.com/BoldBrowser/bold-browser
[04:44:25] <duik> I just feel it's shady. It getting more and more crypto. They just added a crypto wallet to the browser.
[04:44:34] <DiffieHellman> Oh nice, github doesn't even list commits anymore without nonfree JavaScript
[04:44:57] <natewrench123456> is javascript free or nonfree
[04:45:19] <DiffieHellman> JavaScript can be free software, but in most cases on the web it's nonfree software.
[04:45:34] <DiffieHellman> JavaScript is a terrible language regardless, and 100% of sites work better without it.
[04:46:01] <duik> Yes but they force you to use it for basic functionality 
[04:46:25] <DiffieHellman> Those sites aren't worth visiting then :D
[04:46:32] <akonai> github commits do work without javascript on my browser
[04:46:48] <duik> Some sites block you from viewing it if you disable javascript "bot protection" lol
[04:46:54] <White_Flame> natewrench123456: is C++ free or nonfree?
[04:47:03] <DiffieHellman> Oh, it's working now.
[04:47:23] <DiffieHellman> I guess github felt like not serving that request properly
[04:49:31] <duik> Firefox unfortunately doesn't work well for me when I have to attend an internet conference. I need a chromium browser 
[04:50:00] <natewrench123456> thats why GPLv4 should add a warning that you should not use GPLv4 software without source, like the software will not run without source
[04:50:25] <DiffieHellman> Uhh, just because the software is in binary form doesn't automatically make it nonfree
[04:50:31] <White_Flame> duik: I use a script to generate a new chromium profile in /tmp/, run chromium-browser in incognito, then blow it away, for stuff like that

[04:50:58] <natewrench123456> the user should get the source whether they like it or now
[04:51:07] <DiffieHellman> duik: Jitsi works on firefox just fine, just say that you're not joinging conferences that only work on chrome.
[04:51:26] <DiffieHellman> natewrench123456: If they want it, they can ask for it, or get the source in the first place.
[04:51:32] <White_Flame> natewrench123456: I agree
[04:52:00] <White_Flame> DiffieHellman: this would be more for accountability of developers, than convenience of the user
[04:52:01] <Noisytoot> natewrench123456, That's restricting the user's freedom
[04:52:03] <akonai> most workplaces use proprietary software for internet conferences unfortunately
[04:52:06] <White_Flame> (though it's an increase of the latter)
[04:52:17] <natewrench123456> or at least include a decompiler or dissassembler
[04:52:22] <Noisytoot> natewrench123456, You can't make it not run without source

[04:53:05] <Noisytoot> White_Flame, That would violate freedom 0
[04:53:09] <natewrench123456> but the gpl creates a false sense of security
[04:53:10] <DiffieHellman> Requiring that program is only able to run with source is a freedom 0 violation, as in some cases you have only enough space for the binary

[04:53:35] <White_Flame> Noisytoot: how?
[04:53:50] <DiffieHellman> I just explained why.
[04:54:08] <White_Flame> DiffieHellman: you can delete the source part, but that would be your option
[04:54:12] <Noisytoot> White_Flame, It's restricting the freedom to run the program
[04:54:28] <White_Flame> it's a weakness, and a burden on the software provider, to separate hte bin from the source in the first place, and an inconvenience to the user who wants it
[04:54:33] <White_Flame> Noisytoot: no it's not
[04:54:48] <DiffieHellman> White_Flame: That's not what you're saying though.
[04:54:50] <White_Flame> it's purely a requirement on the distribution
[04:54:55] <akonai> requiring source to be included with all binary distribution would use up a lot of storage space considering some git repositories weigh several gb or more 
[04:55:08] <Noisytoot> White_Flame, natewrench123456 said 'like the software will not run without source'
[04:55:10] <DiffieHellman> If a user wants source, they should get the source and then compile binaries from that source.
[04:55:21] <White_Flame> akonai:  yep.  now for those projects whose repositories are GBs, how large are the installations
[04:55:35] <DiffieHellman> *source now
[04:55:41] <natewrench123456> trisquel is like 10GBs
[04:55:45] <White_Flame> Noisytoot: right, to which I said it could just be a license violation, implying not a technical barrier
[04:55:50] <DiffieHellman> If they want the source later, they can get the binaries and request the source later.
[04:56:07] <White_Flame> and a license violation of the developer, not the end user
[04:56:31] <natewrench123456> but if no one requests it then theres no gpl violation
[04:56:37] <akonai> White_Flame: git repositories are often a lot larger than the binaries on larger and older projects due to the fact that git stores the history of all changes made

[06:25:16] <jrmu> all free software licenses permit freedom for reuse for any purpose though (freedom zero), I don't think the way to solve malicious users is to restrict it in the license
[06:25:45] <jrmu> otherwise people add all sorts of unenforceable licenses, and it prevents the free resharing of source code

[06:44:58] <DiffieHellman> The GPLv3 operates as both a copyright license and a contract.

[06:54:32] <natewrench123456> fuschia a totally locked down OS
[06:55:12] <DiffieHellman> Google blatently violates the GPLv2. Google doesn't abuse the GPLv3 though, as the groups that license GPLv3 are going to sue the crap out of them if they do.
[06:55:16] <fossdev> they really doing big business
[06:55:54] <natewrench123456> Google violating v2? They got money to bypass the GPL if they truly were

[06:56:45] <natewrench123456> Git i read is possible under a clause he suggested
[06:57:07] <DiffieHellman> natewrench123456: Yes, but Linus is the big blocker to actually getting people to agree to relicense.
[06:57:24] <natewrench123456> DiffieHellman, well the drivers dont link to the kernel they merely call on the kernel
[06:57:34] <DiffieHellman> If he agrees, then it'll be possible to start asking the other developers to re-license.
[06:57:48] <natewrench123456> DiffieHellman, legally linus is screwed because some contributors are dead
[06:58:03] <DiffieHellman> natewrench123456: A derivitive work released as proprietary software is a GPLv2 violation no matter what.
[06:58:16] <fossdev> But linux helping every big tech.
[06:58:18] <DiffieHellman> You can always re-write code from dead contributers.
[06:59:00] <DiffieHellman> The Linux foundation and ignoring non-compliance is helping big tech, Linux itself not so much.
[06:59:04] <natewrench123456> DiffieHellman, doesnt sound possible re-writing code from dead people, otherwise you have a reactos situation where someone reimplemented copyrighted code
[06:59:59] <DiffieHellman> natewrench123456: You can get someone to look at the code and document it. Someone else who hasn't seen the original code can then rewrite it without any issues.
[07:00:38] <natewrench123456> you'd need patent licenses or waivers then which v2 doesnt grant
[07:00:51] <fossdev> Even if we license code under gpl, companies find a way to abuse the software
[07:01:25] <natewrench123456> thats why i suggest inserting malware into GPL code so companies who abuse it get trolled... jk
[07:01:29] <DiffieHellman> Back to the proprietary drivers, these drivers cannot operate without the kernel Linux. They're even tied to exact versions of Linux, making it a clear cut derivative work. The "ioctl hole" is more of a "ioctl derivative work".
[07:01:47] <natewrench123456> but they use the syscall exceptions
[07:02:04] <DiffieHellman> fossdev: Compaines will abuse software no matter what, but it's a lot better if they can't legally do it.
[07:02:08] <fossdev> Like without linux android doesn't exist
[07:02:29] <natewrench123456> well android would still exist, maybe with the bsd kernel instead
[07:02:45] <fossdev> But not so popular
[07:02:47] <DiffieHellman> natewrench123456: kernel drivers can't use the syscall exception, as they're linked against the kernel.

[07:06:13] <DiffieHellman> Linux can probably operate as a server under Huwrd.
[07:06:40] <natewrench123456> dont make linux under v3 otherwise companies will flee, as much as I would love to see total freedom
[07:06:52] <DiffieHellman> Linux has a lot of drivers yes, but comprimising on freedom just so you can have popularity is pathetic.
[07:07:14] <natewrench123456> linus compromised on keeping the kernel v2 only
[07:07:22] <DiffieHellman> Companies do not flee just because of the GPL.
[07:07:41] <fossdev> I really don't like that companies can even use gpl software like linux to kill us.
[07:08:01] <DiffieHellman> Most will attempt to get away with their requriements, but soon realize they need to comply. 
[07:08:19] <natewrench123456> they got lawyers and money, the end user doesnt
[07:08:22] <DiffieHellman> fossdev: There's nothing copyright law can do to prevent software being used to kill people.
[07:08:49] <DiffieHellman> The end user can assign their copyright to the FSF if they need lawyers to enforce.
[07:09:16] <natewrench123456> maybe linus will assign his copyright to the FSF when he dies
[07:09:23] <DiffieHellman> He will not.
[07:09:34] <DiffieHellman> Linus is a sellout to proprietary companies.

[07:10:51] <DiffieHellman> You need to get accepted by GNU and then you can assign to the FSF
[07:11:38] <fossdev> hmm
[07:12:06] <DiffieHellman> You can often just pay a lawyer to send an email to the infringing business.
[07:12:23] <DiffieHellman> Once they see that email from a lawyer, most will see you mean business and comply.

[12:54:45] <DiffieHellman> It doesn't make much sense that a fireball that can melt an ice block can't melt that.
[12:55:18] <DiffieHellman> At least you can hurt the green enemy's now though.
[12:55:35] <potatoxel[m]> <labrador> "but like people can use his..." <- I think it was that he didnt like that someone else can continue it, and if people liked that persons version more theyll donate more to that person? (i dont remember, my memory is bad)
[12:55:42] <potatoxel[m]> just check there was a reason somewhere
[12:56:26] <kompowiec> right
[12:56:32] <labrador> right yea
[12:57:12] <kompowiec> although I like the swimming function the most, there are also underwater levels in contrib

[12:57:56] <DiffieHellman> Yes, I greatly enjoyed the swimming, sadly it seems a few levels don't actually use the water, just the water skin

[13:48:21] <kompowiec> NAT sucks
[13:48:29] <labrador> yea
[13:48:34] <labrador> youre on a NAT too?
[13:48:39] <labrador> that double sucks
[13:48:49] <labrador> now even pchat wont work
[13:48:53] <DiffieHellman> 99% of IPv4 connections are behind a NAH
[13:49:18] <kompowiec> i have (Address)-restricted-cone NAT on IPv4
[13:49:24] <labrador> But I don't understand why libera uses my ipv4
[13:49:24] <kompowiec> but i have IPv6 without NAT
[13:49:31] <labrador> I have ipv6 too
[13:49:32] <DiffieHellman> The solution is just IPv6, but nooo
[13:49:44] <labrador> Is there a way to force libera to use ipv6?
[13:49:56] <labrador> I'll ask around I guess
[13:50:12] <kompowiec> DiffieHellman, why you need IPv6, you can do cheaper, using CGNAT /s
[13:50:30] <DiffieHellman> CGNAT breaks to many things, it's not funny.
[13:50:40] <kompowiec> half of Indian ISPs thought
[13:50:50] <labrador> you're Indian?
[13:51:09] <DiffieHellman> CIDR, NAT and then CGNAT are the hacks created to delay just doing IPv6 as long as possible
[13:51:15] <kompowiec> no but most of the ip addresses i saw from india were for cgnat
[13:51:31] <labrador> oh ok
[13:51:48] <kompowiec> and eg. ISP netia use CGNAT in poland (which i'm from)
[13:51:54] <labrador> Yeah CGNAT is real nasty
[13:52:21] <kompowiec> fortunaly i have ISP which support IPv6 but they don't let me open IPv6 ports without UPnP argh
[13:52:29] <labrador> lmao
[13:52:54] <kompowiec> and if I wanted the luxury of managing them manually, they would disable my IPv6....
[13:53:27] <DiffieHellman> Here, IPv6 is too hard for the ISP
[13:54:08] <kompowiec> i want a see guide on how to create a DCC connection via ZeroTier

[13:54:28] <DiffieHellman> DCC isn't really something very useful
[13:54:51] <labrador> DCC is pretty useful if everybody is on the open internet
[13:55:00] <labrador> Its kinda just useless now
[13:55:01] <kompowiec> I just wanted to test if DCC group chats are possible
[13:55:15] <labrador> Nope only two
[13:55:18] <kompowiec> :(
[13:55:34] <DiffieHellman> Wouldn't irc channels be the group chats you want?
[13:55:38] <kompowiec> a pity, some IRC clients allow voice calls over DCC
[13:55:48] <labrador> lmao how
[13:55:58] <labrador> does hexchat do that?
[13:55:59] <kompowiec> Kvirc it's protip
[13:56:03] <kompowiec> hexchat nope
[13:56:08] <DiffieHellman> Base64, send, decode
[13:56:13] <labrador> nice
[13:56:27] <DiffieHellman> You can do voice calls over /msg just fine
[13:56:33] <kompowiec> base64 is by IRC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R--_ATzE6o
[13:56:42] <kompowiec> s/by/via
[13:56:46] <labrador> DiffieHellman, anyway to test that
[13:57:15] <kompowiec> but DCC use normally stream
[13:57:15] <kompowiec> http://www.kvirc.net/doc/cmd_dcc.voice.html
[13:57:16] <DiffieHellman> Not without someone else crazy enough to configure their irc client to do that.
[13:57:17] <labrador> Also can't we use OTR to encrypt our messages?

[13:59:01] <labrador> DiffieHellman, you cgnated too?
[13:59:28] <DiffieHellman> I'm not CGNAT'd, but I get 1 IP, so I have no choice but to NAT.
[13:59:37] <kompowiec> labrador, i think if you install something like miniupnpc then i can receive DCC here
[14:00:00] <labrador> That won't solve cgnat my friend
[14:00:11] <labrador> My router will configure
[14:00:19] <labrador> The other router won't
[14:00:31] <kompowiec> if you want communicate with only your friends, ZeroTier is good solution
[14:00:49] <labrador> what's that?
[14:00:54] <DiffieHellman> What if you don't have friends?
[14:00:59] <kompowiec> basically open source hamachi
[14:01:07] <labrador> DiffieHellman, Me too
[14:01:09] <kompowiec> or free software, GPLv3 iirc
[14:01:21] <kompowiec> only mobile client is proprietary
[14:01:33] <DiffieHellman> You heard me typing furiously from there huh?
[14:01:52] <labrador> the server is free?
[14:01:53] <labrador> nice
[14:02:06] <kompowiec> they allow self-host
[14:02:35] <labrador> Of course if the server is free,self hosting is implicitly allowed
[14:02:35] <kompowiec> overall this is probably the best NAT traversal app I have seen.
[14:02:52] <kompowiec> I only knew the better one, but it has been undeveloped since 2004

[14:11:12] <kompowiec> ZeroTier doc says that solve each NAT type except symmetric
[14:11:16] <labrador> I use hexchat?
[14:11:26] <kompowiec> yes, even CGNAT, it works
[14:11:55] <kompowiec> most likely without TURN, there is an option in the program that will check whether you are using it or not.
[14:17:04] <kompowiec> Interestingly, with the current lack of IPv4 addresses, no one has seriously invested in NAT traversal, as a transitional form for IPv6 which must eventually come anyway.
[14:18:10] <DiffieHellman> NAT traversal generally shouldn't be done unless you have no other choice,
[14:18:36] <DiffieHellman> Port forwarding is terrible, but it's better than having to traverse.
[14:18:45] <kompowiec> conspiracy, they want to let suppliers earn VPN,VPS and seedbox providers! (to be clear: it's joke)
[14:19:08] <DiffieHellman> Wait till you see the IPv4 NFT's.
[14:19:59] <kompowiec> I would not be surprised at all.
[14:20:21] <kompowiec> btw. Telecommunications companies have also been suffering from a shortage of phone numbers recently.
[14:20:59] <kompowiec> eg after six months of not using the SIM card, they will assign your number to someone else.
[14:21:22] <kompowiec> although in theory, at least in Poland, you have one year of account validity.
[14:21:56] <DiffieHellman> Phone numbers - the next IPv4
[14:22:11] <kompowiec> indeed
[14:23:44] <DiffieHellman> Country code only gets you so far.
[14:24:14] <kompowiec> once play operator, changed the phone number of an active user and it was a drama on the Polish version of reddit. No wonder since there is GDPR, is a serious breach.

[22:34:32] <Kolev> kompowiec: I don't understand the point of Lix.
[22:34:50] <kompowiec> well, there is now a mania for connecting everything to the internet. Phenomenon.
[22:35:16] <kompowiec> Kolev, probably therefore is discontinued project :P
[22:35:21] <echoSMILE> And then vendors will have access directly to all the devices to "fix" firmware and then FSF will come, 2023 the year of freedom tv, radio, microwave, .........

[22:36:02] <Kolev> echoSMILE: Freedom microwave is called oven.

[22:45:08] <kompowiec> well EU fumbled with the law on routers in order to standardize them.
[22:46:11] <epony> while waiting for standardisation routers are becoming obsolete as category of specialised hardware since the 90ies and becoming miniature generalised smart modems
[22:46:56] <epony> the only thing you lack is proper control of the device, which you do not own most of the time (ISP operated remotely)
[22:47:31] <epony> the consumer appliances are not routers, they are small obsolete devices (their role is just software configuration on generic PCs)
[22:47:49] <kompowiec> therefore the only way is ham radio
[22:48:05] <epony> amateur and professional radio is the source of all innovation
[22:48:19] <echoSMILE> epony: a right channel, a right irc server, a right ISP,  a right datacenter, a right infrastructure, a right __________ need to be made for people saying at IRC "WE WANT FREEDOM!"
[22:48:21] <epony> which commercialised appliances reuse
[22:48:36] <echoSMILE> ^^
[22:49:06] <epony> we want decommercialisation of communications and generic free use of the air and wiring infrastructure
[22:49:32] <epony> that is progressing over time, gradually
[22:50:13] <kompowiec> I don't know as for yall but for me free software connote me of living in the countryside, only digital.
[22:50:33] <epony> better hardware, more control and programmability.. therefore, you just need to force commercial vendors to provide programming documenation and quality tech specs
[22:51:07] <epony> kompowiec, that's a correct evaluation
[22:51:16] <epony> approximation
[22:51:20] *** Joins: nrg (~NRG@user/nrg)
[22:51:43] <kompowiec> So what if I have never lived in the countryside: P
[22:51:51] <epony> the wild west is a silly abstraction carried online by commerce and bandits
[22:51:56] <kompowiec> maybe that's why ..
[22:52:33] <epony> not getting into the commercial crapware leasing economy is how you start
[22:52:57] <epony> and improving gradually your hardware with programmable and professional / industrial quality hardware is how you proceed
[22:53:19] <epony> that's where your stallmans evaporate and become "noise"
[22:53:33] <epony> where you need to operate reliable hardware reliably
[22:53:37] <echoSMILE> The bastards control the very thin layer of material of your device you touch to the emotions your closers get when they receive some content... 
[22:54:22] <epony> you meant to say, points of presence in national ISP peering facilities pollute your regional internet
[22:55:06] <echoSMILE> Who cares about routers... GOV need to be open and transparent, after that everything will be :)
[22:55:19] <epony> that's what google and facebook (akamai) and other CDNs do to your economy, they survey it and suck up your data and then sell you commercial crapware on behalf of its masters
[22:55:49] <epony> GOV is impervious to foreign commerce, it's domestic betrayal if you have problems with your government
[22:56:05] <epony> so deal with it accordingly
[22:56:40] <echoSMILE> Sure sure
[22:57:47] <epony> foreign commerce can not control your country, only you can, and decommissioning corrupt and defective (foreign controlled) politicians is how you clean up your commerce too, since your local commerce installs your local policy
[22:58:01] <epony> therefore, just ban foreign software is the start
[22:58:09] <epony> and then everything falls into place
[22:58:18] <epony> with European and other International regulation
[22:58:24] <kompowiec> like notepad++..
[22:58:32] <echoSMILE> kompowiec: lol
[22:58:34] <epony> US is running on thin farts of Google marketing
[22:58:35] <kompowiec> :P
[22:59:07] <echoSMILE> epony: most countryes go to pub tv smiling showing m$ contracts as if was a nice thing
[22:59:11] <echoSMILE> so...
[22:59:34] <epony> public TV stations are state regulated
[22:59:55] <epony> commercial ones are useless marketing spamhouses
[22:59:59] <echoSMILE> pub tv I meant to say pub media channels (news, journals, ........)
[23:00:28] <epony> there is law and regulation, where personal terminology is inefficient ;-)
[23:00:36] <echoSMILE> families members go against each other "just because"
[23:00:43] <epony> communications are regulated sectors
[23:01:10] <echoSMILE> corruption dont care about regulations
[23:01:14] <epony> so are energetics and transportation
[23:01:42] <epony> if you live in a corrupt state.. your hopes are thin, obviously, you have to take things in your own hands
[23:02:29] <epony> that's what capitalism / federalism (imperialism) is.. corrupt systems of exploitation though positive campaign economic dependency and deregulation and privatisation
[23:02:32] <echoSMILE> well, people do stuff, but that groups are put in a corner with help of most of thing we just said
[23:02:41] <epony> the road to slavery is paved in roman stones
[23:02:59] <echoSMILE> smart EMPs could be cool
[23:03:07] <echoSMILE> but dumb ones...
[23:04:04] <epony> we're the 21st century here, privimite topics from previous centuries are declared obsolete by technology
[23:04:43] <echoSMILE> Not sure about that...
[23:07:47] <epony> villagers accepting foreign indoctrination are your end of indipendence
[23:08:28] <echoSMILE> Do have any idea about what people do even with a simple photo published in an outdoor ?
[23:09:46] <echoSMILE> And most probably the problem is not because the use of GIMP or Photoshop
[23:10:08] <echoSMILE> So...
[23:10:15] <White_Flame> humans have not changed at all ever since there have been humans
[23:10:48] <White_Flame> (though I guess "modern humans" in the anthropological sense would be more correct)
[23:10:49] <epony> the human cooperation has changed
[23:11:30] <epony> so technical advantage makes people more educated and technological progress achieves a lot more than what early humans had access to
[23:11:51] <epony> so that changes modern humans biologically too, with generations of advancement
[23:11:52] <White_Flame> doesn't change what humans are, how they think, and the problems they bring
[23:12:13] <epony> you have to see how crops change with cultivation, before making raw statements of "primitivism"
[23:12:31] <White_Flame> no matter what strawman boogeymen people conjure up to blame, the problems are in the nature of humanity and there's no silver bullet to eliminate them
[23:12:38] <White_Flame> systems must be resilient to such behavior instead
[23:12:42] * echoSMILE 'change', what a nice word...
[23:12:43] <epony> wrong, it changes the entire humanity and all humans, just some individuals don't have access to modern environments
[23:13:02] <epony> White_Flame, your arguments are incontinent
[23:13:23] <epony> people do change
[23:13:46] <echoSMILE> I believe that, because, I did change :D
[23:13:52] <epony> on a grand scale with education and literacy and technology and modern environments of progressive and extended life
[23:13:56] <epony> yes
[23:14:01] <White_Flame> sure, any individual matures
[23:14:11] <White_Flame> but teh nature fo the problems that emerge from humanty have never changed
[23:14:27] <epony> every single individual grows depending on the environment and the capacity of the individual following the entire human technical innovation

[23:14:35] <White_Flame> greed, hypocrisy, megalomania, tribalism, etc
[23:14:49] <echoSMILE> If I am alowed to say, I think I am the right person to speak about my self? I belive people can change, and is not by force for sure.
[23:14:51] <White_Flame> the more you educate/empower people, those attributes still take advantage of the boost up
[23:15:31] <epony> these are just traits of character, where education and family upbringing has failed due to poor access to technology and modern living conditions
[23:15:42] <White_Flame> it is a common fallacy of anarchy, communism, etc that people will somehow not act/think like human has consistently done
[23:15:54] <epony> there is no anarchy
[23:16:03] <White_Flame> and so many other lines of thought make that exact same mistake
[23:16:18] <epony> communism never existed after primeval commune tribal life
[23:16:37] <epony> so all you have is technology and family and school education
[23:16:51] <epony> "institutionalisation" is cancelled ;-)
[23:17:26] <echoSMILE> two persons, if one is at crisis situation and the other at a love situation, they both will use the same hammer differently...
[23:17:49] <epony> the families strive to achive modern living conditions and provide schooling to children up to and inclusive of high school and university, possibly post university support
[23:18:09] <epony> how short it falls is an indication of the local economy and poverty scale of the general population
[23:18:29] <White_Flame> and universities are churning out uneducated pass-throughs, because of the notion that everryone should be shoveled through that process for its namesake alone
[23:18:55] <epony> rich people are not an indication of a society, they are just providinging some "rating of injustice" and "inequality of life prognosis" options
[23:19:09] <epony> your universities are your own doing ;-)
[23:19:12] <epony> do better if you can
[23:19:30] <epony> commercial education is a just a failed economy
[23:20:03] <epony> and with that, you don't have healthcare and anything else
[23:20:20] <White_Flame> are you insinuating that university is for rich people?  because that's not the case in shovelware modern first world
[23:20:38] <epony> so, people who have fallen out of the education system screaming on the internet that the education is "wrong" are just outcasts who do not matter ;-)
[23:21:00] <epony> White_Flame, insinuating is your own doing.
[23:21:16] <epony> you do have control on your local population, you know
[23:21:25] <White_Flame> well, I don't know what you're implying if that's not the case
[23:21:51] <epony> not knowing is a serious problem, it starts with early cancellation of education of individuals
[23:22:04] <White_Flame> other than nonsequitur
[23:22:23] <epony> bullshit <White_Flame> humans have not changed at all ever since there have been humans
[23:22:47] * epony discards White_Flame verbiage
[23:23:20] <White_Flame> that's quite a laggy response :-P

[23:27:04] <White_Flame> however, you can't not start insulting people, so why not just stop and keep at least on the topic of what affects freedoms?
[23:27:10] <epony> White_Flame, I think you're in your early 20ies and did not complete education
[23:27:27] *** Joins: garjola (~garjola@user/garjola)

[23:27:52] <echoSMILE> I did not complete my education yet, hope I have lots more time for it :)
[23:28:41] <echoSMILE> ehm.... not sure if I wanted to say education or formation... probably both ;)
[23:29:09] <epony> continuous education is useful and improves your life views and progress, even if you have not had a chance of formal education, but I find it useful for technical progessions too (mandatory)
[23:29:43] <epony> the commercial western education systems are a disaster ;-)
[23:30:16] <epony> but people becoming "misanthropes" from a faked "public stance" is just.. personal failure
[23:30:39] <epony> White_Flame, hint nudge fix yourself before you breakyourself

[23:30:55] <White_Flame> you're so hypocritical it hurts :)

[23:31:07] <White_Flame> if the topic is interesting I say things, but tohter than that I just wait for your inevitable ban
[23:31:27] <epony> White_Flame, ban seeking is pathetic

[23:40:07] <epony> things are improving in general, not to worry, EU regulation might be late, but it fixes where US one fails badly due to commerce and lobbyism <kompowiec> well EU fumbled with the law on routers in order to standardize them.

[23:40:55] <epony> White_Flame, you were wrong
[23:40:56] <White_Flame> so yes, individuals can and should rise up against the lowest common denominator
[23:41:14] <epony> the lowest common is you and everyone
[23:41:14] <White_Flame> that doesn't stop the negative effects coming from the mass of people
[23:41:27] <epony> they should help each other, not rise and attack each other
[23:42:11] <epony> there are no negative effects that you can't cope with in general education and modernisation of way of life and access to decent living conditions and technical impromvents
[23:43:11] <epony> universities always produce results that political and government sectors give them as objectives
[23:43:50] <White_Flame> there is a reason that free software licenses exist, for instance, because people don't all act towards the same ideals, for many reasons
[23:44:12] <epony> the "universities are churning out damaged goods" is such a wrong stance to begin with, you could NEVER be further than reality than this
[23:44:38] <epony> it's just a "self pity statement" which is unfortunate, but not shared or approved
