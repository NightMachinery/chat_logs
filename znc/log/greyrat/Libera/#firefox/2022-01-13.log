[11:47:13] <becks`> guys, what's going on... my firefox isn't loading any pages
[11:47:32] <Cork> becks`: what happens?
[11:47:50] <void09> Firefox just stopped opening any page, while being open, all of a sudden. Other browsers work. It seems to stall too much upon closing, sometimes it crashes when reopening. Restarting in safe mode, withou extensions also does not work
[11:47:58] <Md> me too, and other people in #linux-it
[11:48:05] <becks`> Cork: same as void09
[11:48:09] <Md> Debian, Ubuntu and Windows users
[11:48:15] <void09> 95.0.2 on linux
[11:48:17] <Cork> så you get a throbber that never stops?
[11:48:23] <Md> all using 95.0.1 or 95.0.2
[11:48:36] <becks`> was running 95 on windows 10, now upgraded to 96 -> still the same
[11:49:10] <Cork> så you get a throbber that never stops? <--
[11:49:18] <Cork> so *
[11:49:18] *** Joins: Mr_Pan (~Mr_Pan@ubuntu/member/Mr-Pan)
[11:49:39] <Cork> just "doesn't load" has many meanings so isn't specific enough
[11:49:44] <Md> yes. it is not even opening localhost
[11:49:52] *** Joins: Uqbar (~sandbox@user/uqbar)
[11:49:52] <Timvde> I also got a few reports IRL, and there are multiple topics on /r/firefox
[11:49:54] <Timvde> Something is going on
[11:50:05] <Cork> go do about:preferecens and open connection settins
[11:50:06] <becks`> Cork well... pages stay empty, nothing happens
[11:50:14] <Cork> check if you have "Enable DNS over HTTPS" checked
[11:50:14] <Md> the network panel of the developers tool does not show anything useful
[11:50:39] <Md> Cork: not me
[11:50:39] <Timvde> Cork: it's really not a personal issue, I think
[11:50:39] <becks`> Cork it's not enabled
[11:50:40] <void09> it's enabled here, with cloudflare
[11:50:45] <Cork> becks`: if you get a white page and not a throbber (in tab icon or similar) then it is a different thing
[11:50:53] *** Joins: Techcable (~Techcable@168.235.93.147)
[11:51:03] <Md> Cork: it keeps loading forever with no apparent timeout
[11:51:08] <void09> same here
[11:51:23] <Md> the resolver is my own
[11:51:44] <void09> processes seems stuck in memory for a while, as closing and reopening says firefox is already running but no respnoding
[11:52:01] <Md> same, I had to kill it to be able to restart it
[11:52:12] <Cork> could be an rpc problem
[11:52:19] <hnj> hi, firefox on linux: when I download a file I’d like to open it in vim in a terminal or just generally with a manually entered command line, possibly including options/arguments. IIRC this used to be possible some years ago. the dialog only let’s me list (graphical?) applications from whatever list AFAICT. any hints how to do that? STFW didn’t get me any relevant results but maybe I just didn’t use
[11:52:21] <hnj> the right keywords … AFAICT ATM I really need to download the file and do that manually, is that correct?
[11:52:22] <becks`> how can mozilla shut down our browser... unbelievable
[11:52:31] <Cork> meaning the child process for the webpage can't be reaced by the ui process
[11:52:40] <Cork> becks`: they can't
[11:52:42] <Timvde> becks`: I don't think they "shut down your browser", that would not really help them
[11:52:48] <Cork> you prob just hitting a common bug
[11:53:07] <Cork> it works fine here
[11:53:10] <Timvde> Cork: I didn't update since the beginning of this week though
[11:53:19] <Timvde> And I don't have anything in `about:studies`
[11:53:33] <Cork> Timvde: you run linux right?
[11:53:35] <void09> well why did it hit us just no ? It was working fine, being opened.. now it doesn't
[11:53:54] <Uqbar> so, without DNS over HTTPS, the Network tab only shows a GET request, and nothing more. With DOH, NS_BINDING_ABORTED shows up.
[11:54:09] <Md> same
[11:54:19] <Timvde> Cork: yes
[11:54:48] <Cork> Timvde: have you shutdown firefox and in ex htop verified that all the child bineries are gone and started it again?
[11:54:51] <Uqbar> (fresh profile, no plugins or anything. The tabs keep showing the throbber)
[11:55:08] <Timvde> Cork: it's gone after a restart *for now*
[11:55:11] <Md> Cork: I did
[11:55:18] <Uqbar> I even rebooted, nothing changed.
[11:55:20] <Timvde> A friend of mine who reported it, has had it come back
[11:55:24] <Cork> sounds like an rpc bug to me
[11:55:28] *** Joins: Cyp (~cyp@213.237.85.9)
[11:55:43] <Timvde> It was the main process going rogue btw
[11:56:03] <Cork> ya, the protocol is binary so the child and main has to be exactly the same
[11:56:04] <Cyp> Uh, firefox is down?! On all my machines??!
[11:56:13] <Cork> Cyp: try restarting firefox
[11:56:17] <Cork> should fix it
[11:56:19] <Cyp> Didn't help.
[11:56:33] <Cyp> Just made cpu usage go from 100% to 142%.
[11:56:35] <Cork> Cyp: os?
[11:56:41] <Timvde> Cyp: we are just discussing that, the cause is still unknown, but it appears to be happening to many people all over the world
[11:56:41] <Cyp> Gentoo and mac.
[11:56:57] <Uqbar> Cork: I hear it happens on Windows as well
[11:56:59] <Cork> Cyp: so stop firefox and make sure all its processes are gone
[11:57:00] <Cyp> How the ??! is that even possible? Can't access localhost even.
[11:57:01] <Cork> then start it again
[11:57:18] <Cork> Cyp: i'm pretty sure it is a rpc bug
[11:57:21] <Uqbar> Cork: I've rebooted and it keeps happening
[11:57:26] <becks`> I set network.http.http3.enabled false... killed Firefox -> still wasn't working -> after a minute it started to work again
[11:57:32] <Cork> Uqbar: firefox uses rpc on all oses
[11:57:56] <Cyp> Killing and restarting firefox a few times didn't help.
[11:58:04] <Md> Cork: I did it again and NOW it works
[11:58:15] <Uqbar> Md: wtf
[11:58:16] <Md> but I am sure that I did it right the first time as well
[11:58:19] <Cork> Cyp: and you verified all processes are got before trying again?
[11:58:26] <Cyp> killall -v -9 firefox
[11:58:38] <Cork> the child process aren't called firefox
[11:58:50] <Md> I did check with ps axf|grep firefox
[11:59:22] <Timvde> Cork: a reboot should make sure all processes are gone :P
[11:59:23] <Cork> ah, correction they have renamed them now days
[11:59:30] <Cork> yes
[12:00:05] <Cork> so the only other thing i can think of is google safebrowsing
[12:00:41] <Md> Cork: I disabled it years ago (I actually need to visit phishing pages)
[12:00:51] <Cork> yay...
[12:01:33] <Cork> hmm could be offline mode?
[12:01:47] <Cork> should show a "your offline" page though...
[12:02:00] <Uqbar> so, I disabled http3 and restarted firefox and now it works
[12:02:00] <becks`> yep, don't think that many people went to offline mode ;D
[12:02:20] <becks`> Uqbar same for me, however I re-enabled it and it is still working now....
[12:02:26] <Uqbar> wow
[12:02:51] <Cork> becks`: offline is controlled by firefox polling a txt file form mozilla.org så if that went down it could actually
[12:03:07] <Cyp> What will happen next. Should I worry about my text editor going down some day?
[12:03:10] <Uqbar> hah, same here: re-enabled http3 and it works
[12:03:16] <Md> offline mode behaves differently, it was not that
[12:03:33] <Cork> http://detectportal.firefox.com/success.txt?ipv4
[12:03:42] <Cyp> Firefox on Android seems to be working, but nowhere else.
[12:04:23] <Cyp> That link gives me "success" in konqueror (and doesn't load in firefox).
[12:04:58] <germ> Aand... firefox not freaking working once more

[12:17:26] <zibolo> Hello all! Has anyone experienced problems with Firefox "today" on Ubuntu 20.04? In my workplace Firefox stopped working on four computers at the same time
[12:17:36] <royaljelly> haha
[12:17:45] <royaljelly> zibolo: see https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29918052

[12:18:01] <Cork> so yes, some ppl experience problems with http3
[12:18:02] <Mr_Pan> zibolo :| 
[12:18:09] <royaljelly> maybe someone should put the solution in the topic
[12:18:36] <Cork> it isn't a solution, it is a workaround
[12:18:51] <MelchiorGaspar> yup the workaround worked for me ..  network.http.http3.enabled
[12:18:54] <zibolo> royaljelly: in fact I was expecting something about it in the topic, it's a good idea to put it in
[12:19:00] <Cork> and just flipping that and forgetting it will likely cause problem in the future
[12:19:20] <MelchiorGaspar> once there is a fix I will re-enable it'

[12:42:39] <Md> yes, even localhost

[13:22:47] <Peng> While there are trade-offs to implementing standards under development (like increased complexity from version negotiation, or painful design changes) you can't assume that code quality will be significantly better if you wait longer to implement, test and deploy it.

[13:30:15] <Timvde> Apart from that, nothing
[13:30:27] <W> my firewall disallows Firefox from contacting Mozilla domains
[13:30:32] <Techman> Is Mozilla taking my use of forced compact mode into account?
[13:30:40] <Techman> If they actually do remove compact mode I am going to be upset
[13:30:49] <haakon> My usage patterns are private. I honestly thought I had disabled telemetry. Firefox shouldn't depend on people's private data

[13:31:13] <ede> Timvde: such things don't work, people do things, you see they do them, you have no reason why they do them. so you take the wrong decision.
[13:31:15] <W> (I have this set up exactly because I cannot trust Mozilla to respect the settings I choose)
[13:31:20] <Timvde> haakon: Mozilla only collects anonymized information, see about:telemetry for all stats

[13:31:59] <Timvde> ede: people do things, you see that it's weird, you push a change that should make it more clear how they can do it more efficiently, you see what the results are
[13:32:04] *** Quits: nede82 (~sergio.mi@host-185-61-15-78.ip.retelit.it) (Quit: Sto andando via)
[13:32:20] <haakon> Timvde: I'm sure they make an effort to anonymize it. Personally I optimitize for privacy, which is an even easier decision when telemetry can trigger a functional breakdown of the browser
[13:32:26] <hnj> anonymization is hard, though, and there are more than enough cases documented where people failed to do it correctly and only did pseudonymization …

[13:32:51] <Timvde> haakon: That's fair, and completely up to you. I was just answering to your question "what's so bad about it?"
[13:33:05] <ede> why weird? that's subjective. TMTOWTDI but sometimes a method is just more effective than the other. but even here there are exceptions.
[13:33:10] <Timvde> Also note the "Apart from that, nothing", so if you don't care about that reason, go ahead and disable it
[13:34:15] <ede> like why were tabgroups removed and feeds and compact mode?
[13:34:39] <ede> people don't use stuff if they don't know about it or if it's horribly implemented.
[13:34:58] <ede> i remember the days when there was a RSS button in the bar.
[13:35:46] <ede> and now we're mostly back at mails and annoying notifications every time after opening a site
[13:36:48] <Timvde> ede: telemetry is just one of the inputs the UX team considers. It mostly helps in evaluating changes, more than driving changes.
[13:37:49] <ede> Timvde: yeah, but since telemetry never says WHY people do things it doesn't give any hint what to fix.
[13:38:10] <Timvde> ede: "It mostly helps in evaluating changes, more than driving changes."
[13:38:59] <haakon> Is there any chance that telemetry may have been silently re-enabled at some point? I could have sworn I had it disabled
[13:39:03] <ede> often enough i press C-s and have to wait for the dialog to be complete (Esc too early often enough crashed the browser) when i actually wand to C-d.
[13:39:50] <ede> sometimes i want to add a bookmark, sometimes i just want to check if i have one already for that URL. i'd check the bookmark button, only i don't have one ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[13:40:42] <Timvde> How come you don't have a bookmark button? It's in the location bar.
[13:40:49] <ede> so C-s doesn't mean i actually want to save something, C-d doesn't mean i want to create a bookmark. also it doesn't mean i prefer hotkeys, it's just a simpler solution than to search it in the menu.
[13:41:01] <susi_> maybe just ctrl-d to add a bookmark, you'll see if you have already bookmarked it
[13:41:26] <ede> not for me. than thing hanging down is only like a few pixel tall
[13:41:28] <susi_> you should prefer hotkeys
[13:42:04] <susi_> you have some custom chrome css?
[13:42:06] <Techman> Speaking of bookmarks
[13:42:34] <Techman> Can someone tell me how to manually remove a tag from the bookmarks menu? Right-click -> Delete does not work.
[13:42:58] <ede> during the days windows was just a DOS GUI microsoft had a clear line in its design guides: it's up to the user to decide, don't force a UX path onto them. menu, hotkey, button, it's all fine. best is to have all 3 options.
[13:43:19] <Techman> So, Library->Tags->(select item)->Delete does not work
[13:43:36] <ede> susi_: no, i just have my own idea about what a usable UI is, which starts with the URL bar not being usable for searches.
[13:44:19] <ede> and URL bar should be just that, i don't want a shitload of buttons in it. URLs are insanely long most of the time and in its initial state that thing is ridiculously small already.

[13:44:42] <ede> and iirc there are even empty spaces on both sides, which makes it even worse.
[13:45:21] <ede> Tags? is this one of the 2 fields for extra info on bookmarks?
[13:45:37] <susi_> I'm pretty sure this is the very definition of usable UI https://0x0.st/o-aY.png
[13:45:40] <ede> never understood why only one of them would appear in the createin dialogue
[13:46:43] <ede> works for normal sized URLs, yes. but where's the search?
[13:46:51] <Techman> ede: yeah, tags. I created a tag that started with a '.' once (so, '.search' instead of 'search'), and now I cannot delete the one that starts with a '.'
[13:47:15] <Timvde> Techman: can you just remove it from the bookmarks that have it?
[13:47:19] <ede> do you get it in the library?
[13:47:32] <Techman> Shows up in the library, no bookmarks use the tag anymore

[13:49:52] <Techman> I think I might have to manually edit the database where bookmarks are stored to remove the tag
[13:51:14] <ede> Techman: can you rename it? i prepended the predefined commands in hexchat with . to just get at least those out of default namespace while i was sill trying to memorize irc commands. side effect, they don't show up on /list anymore. maybe it's some gtk thing already because dotfiles.

[13:55:16] <ede> of course it's a waste of space, but even with an extra search box entries from "important pages" on the start tab seem to appear in the result list while typing a part of a URL
[13:56:06] <susi_> you can disable that behavior in settings, if I got what you mean
[13:56:26] <ede> or iirc even with a simple hostname i need the / at the end or it will do a search
[13:56:58] <ede> i disabled and changed a lot already and i still get google when i want to do other things
[13:57:01] <susi_> what kind of simple hostname? 
[13:57:13] <ede> as defined in some RFC
[13:57:21] <ede> like each of the words here
[13:58:20] <Timvde> susi_: I know if I want to go back to a page I previously visited or search the web, so having search results instead of history items or the other way around is counter-productive
[13:58:33] <Timvde> Also privacy, I don't want to send each website I start typing to my search engine
[13:58:37] <ede> works somehow now, no idea what i had to change for it
[13:59:14] <ede> in addition i DO WANT to get suggestions from search engines when doing an actual search
[13:59:31] <Timvde> susi_: I also challenge you to search for "asm.js" on Firefox Android in private browsing :)
[13:59:31] <susi_> Timvde: it does not send everything I type until I press Enter :-) dunno what's the default behavior
[13:59:44] <Timvde> susi_: but I do want suggestions when I make an actual search
[14:00:10] <susi_> I don't want suggestions in the url bar, I want them only when I use the search site
[14:00:11] <ede> already for typos only.you don't know the correct spelling of every possible name, google has at least a suggestion on the result page, what about amazon and wikipedia?
[14:00:17] <Timvde> Since I'm planning to send what I'm typing to my search engine anyway, the privacy argument is void
[14:01:16] <ede> if the search doesn't do more than to send mo to the site where i'd have to type the search term then a list of buttons would be the better solution
[14:01:43] <susi_> try also $ in your url bar, it shows only stuff part of web address in history
[14:02:48] <ede> https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/mark-zuckerberg-loses-7-billion-as-advertisers-drop
[14:03:00] <ede> i get this articles from 3 sites when typing "$ as"
[14:03:36] <ede> and all suggestions include $
[14:05:02] <ede> also: when i only type "as" it becomes "askubuntu.com/" and if the s was a typo i don't have to press BSP one time, but twice. brought me the wrong suggestions more than a single time.
[14:05:06] <susi_> I don't see $ in that url
[14:05:18] <susi_> but I see 'as' in it

[20:42:16] <gtlsgamr> Is there a way to stop it from doing this?
[20:44:10] <Cyp> Not sure, but maybe if in about:preferences / Files and Applications, choosing Always ask you where to save files.
[20:45:01] <gtlsgamr> Cyp: That solves the downloadbuttom problem. But when I click upload, it always creates the "Desktop" folder

[21:45:32] *** Joins: Haudegen (~quassel@178.115.237.87.static.drei.at)
[21:46:10] <roger21> any ideas on how to debug a fetch error "TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource." on an outdated firefox browser ?
[21:46:48] <roger21> it use to work just fine, and suddenly its dead (it still work on current firefox)

[21:47:43] <roger21> i was thinking a certificate or something but i dont have certificate errors with direct access
[21:48:26] <labrador> roger21, do you need to use an outdated build of firefox?
[21:48:54] <roger21> maybe some changes on the server headers but i cant check if it actually changed (don't know what was before)
[21:49:54] *** Parts: Zelouille (~Zelouille@lfbn-ncy-1-707-42.w86-216.abo.wanadoo.fr) ()
[21:53:19] <roger21> the headers are super basic anyway and the request is based on "same-origin"
[21:53:25] *** Joins: `St0ner (~services@user/st0ner/x-3205467)
[21:54:03] <roger21> since the browser didn't changed what could make a fetch request not working anymore 
[21:54:29] <roger21> still thinking of a certificate or something
