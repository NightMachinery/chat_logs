[00:24:11] <DomLS3> @Killine depends I happen to like Barracuda's filtering and searching options. It's much easier to find and deliver a blocked email in barracuda than it is in 365. And if your budget isn't hurting over the cost of Barracuda then just use both. I've seen instances of Barracuda catching things that 365 doesn't, and vice-versa

[07:00:36] <sd> 11<H​otmess> so whats your next move zoey? find somewhere better?
[07:00:41] <monr0e> Nah, unprofessional is bringing an emotional argument into the workplace. Criticism does nto need to be rounded out with praise, it needs to be accompanied by opportunity. If an employee of mine churns out, say, poorly syntaxed code, I'll happily tell them they have a problem with syntax, and give them some time and training to improve it. I don't need to run my mouth of telling them they're a great dev, aside from this one thing. It sends the wrong 
[07:00:41] <monr0e> message, it says that there isn't really a problem at all.

[07:02:41] <monr0e> I do, however, take umbrage with telling a person their work is not up to scratch *without* giving them that out. That's just shitting on someone without giving them recourse.

[12:06:52] <Hunterkll> DrZak: but in reality, if you're not doing bulk machines, just set DHCP options for UEFI boot x64 machines and call it a day 
[12:07:02] <DrZak> ok so, this whole thing is only relevant if you use SCCM to boot things , not just like package manager
[12:07:03] <Hunterkll> no need to overcomplicate it
[12:07:09] <Hunterkll> yes
[12:07:14] <sd> 11<H​otmess> or update machines
[12:07:25] <sd> 11<H​otmess> but you dont need layer 2 access for that

[12:07:36] <Hunterkll> and updates are a whole different ballgame, throw out multicast / etc and ignore it
[12:07:47] <DrZak> and now, if you do use it to boot stuff, when you set up DHCP and ip helper properly, it will route the machines to the correct sccm endpoint with the boot file
[12:07:56] <Hunterkll> just need DHCP
[12:07:59] <Hunterkll> ignore the ip helper stuff
[12:08:08] <DrZak> yet, you still need to make sure the requests dont trigger the storm protection on the switch
[12:08:16] <sd> 11<H​otmess> that would be the ip helper
[12:08:20] <Hunterkll> unless you're doing like, more than 10+ machines at once

[12:08:25] <Hunterkll> ignore it

[12:10:59] <Hunterkll> DrZak: and if you are, unless you're doing a fuckload of machines at once, also ignore all of this
[12:11:03] <Hunterkll> not even remotely worth the LOE 
[12:11:27] <Hunterkll> and if all you have is newish x64 UEFI machines, just set standard DHCP options on every VLAN to point at your SCCM server for PXE booting

[12:19:36] <Hunterkll> general purpose win embed is LTSC

[12:20:00] <Hunterkll> end of the day, it's the exact same code bits, just different licensing

[12:22:35] <Hunterkll> a business with existing hardware cannot buy IOT enterprise
[12:22:56] <Hunterkll> they can  buy regular 10 Enterprise w/SA to receive LTSC and use that, however. it's identical
[12:23:29] <Hunterkll> Also, the IOT Enterprise license is reduced cost *because* of the licensing restrictions
[12:23:53] <Hunterkll> IOT Enterprise must be used for a specific single purpose, cannot run other commercial applications, and the embedded application must be pre-installed on the OS and ship with the device
[12:24:05] <DrZak> :)
[12:24:11] <Hunterkll> unlike general purpose windows embedded, which you can buy and do whatever the fuck you wa nt with, comparitively 
[12:26:00] <Hunterkll> so in the case of the embedded style use cases, for example, if you're replacing workstations for manufacturing hardware yourself, you buy non-IOT LTSC. If you're buying the upgraded machines fromt he manufacturing hardware vendor, it may come with IOT LTSC, but you lose a lot of legal flexibility, so those normally ship with non-IOT LTSC

[12:35:53] <Hunterkll> because IOT update is the same - exactly, identically the same - as regular full windoiws licensed
[12:36:16] <Hunterkll> if you have a fleet of IOT Enterprise thin clients, you still deploy your SCCM agent/InTune/whatever to manage updates
[12:37:00] <Hunterkll> and you can only ever use that windows client for that specific thin client scenario/VDI system 
[12:37:04] <Hunterkll> Specific Use. The manufacturer designed the licensed device for a specific use. You may only use the 
[12:37:04] <Hunterkll> software for that use.

[12:38:31] <Hunterkll> This clause right here -> Desktop Functions. If your system performs desktop functions, then you must ensure that they: (i) are only used to support the industry application, and (ii) operate only when used with the industry application.

[12:39:07] <Hunterkll> POS application. If the software is installed on a retail point of service device, you may use the software with a point of service application (“POS Application”).

[12:39:07] <Hunterkll> /or (ii) provide information directly and indirectly to customers about available products and services. You may not use the software on a device with automated teller machine (“ATM”) as the primary functionality. 
[12:39:17] <Hunterkll> that last clause is also telling
[12:39:21] <Hunterkll> you can't use it on an ATM explicitly
[12:40:44] <Hunterkll> so sure, where you'd have used say, XPe / 7 POS / 8.1 Ind Pro for a retail POS system you can now use a lower cost IOT enterprise license, that's great, there's more options
[12:41:46] <Hunterkll> so you can't do office functions (thin client usage), can't do ATMs, etc 
[12:41:54] <teh_f4ll3n> Morning, server junkies
[12:42:16] <Hunterkll> and for IOT Enterprise devices, you can't use other commercial software. So the software you're running on IOT Enterprise device has to have come from the same place you bought the IOT Enterprise licensed machine
[12:44:36] *** Quits: bloody (~bloody@user/bloody) (Quit: okluvyabubye)
[12:44:49] <Hunterkll> @Hotmess anyway, the long and short of it is, IOT Enterprise is only useful as a licensing SKU for companies making a combined software/hardware system that's a dedicated, single purpose scenario. 
[12:45:34] <Hunterkll> hence XP having a separate POS SKU (which this would be equal to) in addition to XP Embedded (which regular licensed GAC/SAC would be equal to)
[12:45:39] <Hunterkll> GAC/LTSC
[12:46:08] <Hunterkll> It does get even more complex, because there's actually three separate IOT Enterprise SKUs based on machine type/configuration
[12:49:07] <Hunterkll> "Entry" "Value" and "High End" - which CPU you're using determine which license SKU you pay for
[12:49:23] <Hunterkll> Entry's Atoms and shit, Value's i3/i5, High end is i7+ type CPUs

[13:15:20] <Azem> I wonder if I can do it with Ansible directly

[13:17:49] <Hunterkll> but SCCM is what invokes scorch
[13:17:58] <Hunterkll> i'm sure you could use SCCM to run a commandline to invoke ansible too or whatever

[14:21:14] <sd> 13<C​olour> Sad

[14:21:47] <sd> 13<C​olour> Settings menu on Windows 10 wouldn't let you have multiple settings windows at once
[14:21:49] <Hunterkll> because not remotely feature complete 
[14:21:54] <Hunterkll> Azem: i still absolutely abhor WSL2
[14:21:57] <sd> 13<C​olour> So I couldn't have Windows Updates and Network Adapters open at the same time?

[14:22:06] <CptLuxx> but not wsl2
[14:22:14] <CptLuxx> dont need a fancy vm
[14:22:19] <Hunterkll> WSL1 is equally native to the kernel as Win32 
[14:22:24] <sd> 13<C​olour> Like why does settings menu not let me open multiple windows? ???
[14:22:28] <Hunterkll> WSL2 is just a pseudo-Dom0 
[14:22:39] <Hunterkll> i mean, i get your point colour, but wtf would you have those both op en for anyway?
[14:22:41] <sd> 13<C​olour> Ok I still can't open multiple settings windows
[14:22:42] <Azem> Hunterkll: Yeah I get the pain that we were close to perfection 
[14:22:44] <Hunterkll> i just use search and back/forth 
[14:22:59] <sd> 13<C​olour> Because I want to have updates open and running while I'm looking at network adapters or while I'm changing personal stuff
[14:23:05] <sd> 13<C​olour> I want to monitor how the updates are going
[14:23:09] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:23:12] <Hunterkll> that's just petty 
[14:23:14] <Azem> CptLuxx: there are few stuff that need full fat Linux kernel like Docker but otherwise I would probably use WSL1 as well
[14:23:16] <Hunterkll> use powershell instead
[14:23:17] <Hunterkll> :P
[14:23:18] <sd> 13<C​olour> I mean why take away the feature?
[14:23:22] <Hunterkll> Azem: no, no there's not
[14:23:23] <sd> 13<C​olour> I do use powershell for updates now ye
[14:23:25] <Hunterkll> they could have implememnted it
[14:23:32] <sd> 13<C​olour> But there is legit no reason to take away having multiple windows
[14:23:42] <Azem> yeah they could Hunterkll and I wish as well they did
[14:23:48] <sd> 13<C​olour> You can't just justify it with a "Well why would you need that?" haha
[14:24:21] <Hunterkll> well, it's just the architecture of the new system

[14:24:29] <Hunterkll> there are ways to do it
[14:24:32] <CptLuxx> and i dont use any off these so wsl is perfect
[14:24:33] <Hunterkll> but it's not exactly clean yet

[14:26:20] <Hunterkll> @Colour but like I said, I get your point, but you realize it's mostly mass market stuff and use cases.

[14:26:51] <Hunterkll> for everything else, there's more advanced tools

[18:27:38] <misspwn> yeah 
[18:27:46] <PublicWiFi> what do you mean estranger ?
[18:27:54] <Hunterkll> crypto is one of the saner casinos
[18:27:56] <PublicWiFi> med school debt is insane
[18:28:03] <PublicWiFi> I think he's at like half a mil or something
[18:28:04] <Hunterkll> he could have dumped it into gamestop options
[18:28:12] <estranger> i dont want to sell this house before i close on my new house so ill have two mortagages.. and not sure if my debt ratio will allow that
[18:28:21] <PublicWiFi> Hunterkll: at he did get in during the annual january dip lol
[18:28:25] <PublicWiFi> and* 
[18:28:31] <PublicWiFi> ohhhh
[18:28:32] <estranger> mortegage guy is trying to see if I can leverage my RSU grants as income which would make it all ok
[18:28:38] <estranger> if not, i have to pay off this house before closing
[18:28:47] <PublicWiFi> is it a big ol mortgage?
[18:28:50] <estranger> which id rather not if I dont have to
[18:28:55] <estranger> $400k left on this house
[18:28:58] <misspwn> estranger, they will be able to tell you that well before. for us i had to pay off my car loan but and a few things
[18:29:01] <PublicWiFi> at least you'd get it back after selling yeah?
[18:29:04] <PublicWiFi> so its just a short term dump
[18:29:18] <estranger> PublicWiFi, yeah then ill get it back, and can put that money onto my new mortgage  and recast it for lower payments
[18:29:27] <misspwn> i didn't understand some of that at first either with the debt to income ratios
[18:29:35] <estranger> misspwn, yeah i just paid off my car loan and will see if I can pay ahead 100% on my car lease to bring down my payments
[18:29:47] <misspwn> and how the 4grand i had left on my car loan really didn't make an impact but he said i had to
[18:29:54] <estranger> then add in my RSU grants and I shoujld be able to hold both mortegages 
[18:30:04] <Hunterkll> crazy though how you can pay off the old one right now but that's not good enough
[18:30:07] <Hunterkll> has to fit the computer 
[18:30:08] <estranger> IF my RSUs can count 
[18:30:37] <misspwn> we had to borrow off our 401k  just 10k to move things around but we made it work and dumped that money back in when we sold
[18:30:39] <estranger> loan companies dont care that I could pay cash for the house if I wanted to.. they just care about money in vs money out
[18:30:48] <misspwn> ^
[18:31:23] <estranger> my plan is to take small quarterly withdrawls from my stonks to supliment my house payments 
[18:31:24] <misspwn> well if you need help moving funds my mortgage has less than 400k left :D
[18:31:31] <estranger> misspwn, haha
[18:31:56] <estranger> but paying off my car loads will add $1000/month to my ratio... that MIGHT be enough
[18:32:04] <misspwn> it's been almost 4 years, surely its lower than that :D
[18:32:16] <misspwn> idk we never set up joint accounts we are lazy
[18:32:34] <estranger> if debt interest rate < my growth rate of other funds id rather keep the debt

[19:43:04] <Hunterkll> @bdenlinger smallpox vaccine
[19:43:09] <int0x1C8> incise the skin, introduce vaccine to wound
[19:43:19] <Kiernian> there USED to be such a thing as a vaccine scar for the old polio vaccination...which they stopped giving in..1969? 1970? I forget
[19:43:22] <Hunterkll> well, it was more like 6 pricks at once but yea 
[19:43:42] <Kiernian> smallpox, not polio, that's right
[19:44:10] <Hunterkll> don't do smallpox vaccines anymore since outside of like two labs it's considered eradicated
[19:44:18] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Ah ok, I'm not old enough to have had a smallpox vaccine
[19:45:44] <int0x1C8> bden, they would harvest the pus from people infected with a certain bovine version of the pox (primarily milk maids in a specific area of the UK), then put that in an open wound to vaccinate someone
[19:46:40] <int0x1C8> except it was called variolation at the time, because smallpox is Variola major/minor
[19:47:37] <Hunterkll> that and it was live virus material instead of neutered or training inert material
[19:48:14] <int0x1C8> because some dude who I forget the name of noticed that even though the milkmaids had a pretty much constant infection of cowpox, they seemed to be immune to smallpox proper
[19:48:52] <Hunterkll> hmm, article i'm reading says they used it from cows
[19:48:53] <Hunterkll> either way
[19:49:04] <Hunterkll> Following a technique first developed by Edward Jenner in the late 18th century, smallpox vaccination in 1900 meant scoring the skin of the upper arm with a lancet or knife, and then dabbing the wound with live virus. Vaccine makers in 1900 still sourced their virus from oozing cowpox sores on the underside of calves.
[19:49:22] <int0x1C8> right, its a bovine pox, cowpox
[19:49:34] <PublicWiFi> not as dangerous I'd assume
[19:49:41] <PublicWiFi> but still close enough to give you a better chance with the real thing
[19:49:44] <Hunterkll> right, but close enough
[19:49:58] <Hunterkll> kinda what modern vaccines do but they just use a butchered inert version of the real thing
[19:50:14] <int0x1C8> the milk maids obviously worked the most with the cows so they were most often infected by that cowpox
[19:50:45] <fritzwastaken> Why the hell can I paste code blocks into Teams with language color coding, but I cant do it in Onenote
[19:50:47] <Hunterkll> or in the case of the mRNA stuff developed a decade ago, just enough to train you to identify a unique part of the virus instead of neutered virus itself
[19:50:51] <fritzwastaken> So dumb
[19:50:53] <signofzeta> if we're wondering about the COVID vaccine, that was developed from the SARS vaccine, so that's how we got it out so fast.

[20:05:31] <estranger> csws, get out
[20:05:31] <int0x1C8> AK without a stock and short barrel? that's a pistol!
[20:05:34] <sintax> i wanna be implanted in PublicWiFi 's brain
[20:05:40] <estranger> s/brain/ass
[20:05:40] <layer8> sintax meant: "i wanna be implanted in PublicWiFi 's ass"
[20:05:45] <int0x1C8> AK without stock and long barrel? NO NOT ALLOWED.
[20:05:46] <PublicWiFi> there's like 5 of us here, there's room for 1 more
[20:05:48] <PublicWiFi> :D
[20:05:48] <Hunterkll> int0x1C8: lol i got an AR15 lower engraved pistol just for that flexibility, hahah
[20:05:49] <sintax> int0x1C8: i have a 30 caliber "pistol" 10.5" barrel
[20:05:54] <signofzeta> I have heart issues and got the vaccine without side effects in there (though it made me feel like shit)
[20:05:56] <int0x1C8> AK with stock and short barrel? NO NOT ALLOWED.
[20:06:01] <sintax> 300 blackout
[20:06:05] <Hunterkll> it's stupid
[20:06:27] <Hunterkll> lower's the same, but if you put a long barrel on it first, you can't ever make it a pistol, just have to pay the SBR money, but if it starts as a pistoil, it can go to rifle and back no issues.... 
[20:06:34] <PublicWiFi> sintax: that sounds amazing
[20:06:36] <Hunterkll> fuckin' insanity
[20:06:54] <PublicWiFi> I shot a homemade redneck 12 gauge "pistol" once
[20:07:02] <sintax> PublicWiFi: sweet little toy. 10.5" barrel, adjustable stock. saving for a suppressor for it. $800 + $200 for tht atf stamp
[20:07:05] <Hunterkll> csws: kafka is why estranger isn't worried about paying off a 400k mortgage if he has too, it's an inconvinence 
[20:07:06] <PublicWiFi> looked like a wireframe flare gun, but with a 12 gauge shell lol
[20:07:07] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:07:13] <PublicWiFi> it was awful xDD
[20:07:14] <int0x1C8> I've had the best success educating the other liberals I know on that specific law, great way to break the ice
[20:07:15] <sintax> supposed to be as close to whisper sounding like the movies. 
[20:07:21] <sintax> gonna shoot feral pigs with it
[20:07:22] <estranger> Hunterkll, lol well put
[20:07:25] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: and that's a paddlin with bubba 
[20:07:28] <estranger> "aww damnit if I HAVE to..."
[20:07:31] <PublicWiFi> Hunterkll: xDD
[20:07:32] <fritzwastaken> Ohhh from covid mandates to gun laws, whats next? Just straight up politics?
[20:07:42] <sintax> nope
[20:07:42] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: illegal sawed off shotgun you made, not a shotgun pistol :P 
[20:07:52] * sintax sits next to fritzwastaken
[20:07:55] <haise01> fritzwastaken: they are gonna speed run through all
[20:08:01] <PublicWiFi> i didn't make it lol
[20:08:08] <PublicWiFi> a guy named "speedy" down the road did
[20:08:12] <PublicWiFi> I wish I was making this up
[20:08:14] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: hilariously, that's why those revolvers that also "take" 410 shells are legal, becaues they're rifled pistols, the shell just happens to fit 
[20:08:15] <Hunterkll> LOL
[20:08:16] <Hunterkll> what the fuck
[20:08:25] <fritzwastaken> lol. IRC Rule breaking speed run. First POL, then Religion, then Dox someone, then Racism, then Firearms
[20:08:26] <Hunterkll> that's like the dude selling energy drinks out of his treehouse with gasoline and meth in them
[20:08:29] <PublicWiFi> he used to raise chickens for fighting and everything
[20:08:38] <PublicWiFi> i live in the fuckin backwood man

[20:09:32] <csws> PublicWiFi, did he vote for biden? remember he ain't black if he didn't
[20:09:37] <sd> 14<A​rakno  [🏆π]> I’m the odd one out. I have zero knowledge of guns
[20:09:39] <csws> race + pol

[20:09:51] <Hunterkll> Arakno I grew up with 'em? I hunt? I'm also former military? (there's a lot of former military / law enforcement in tech)
[20:09:51] <PublicWiFi> @A​rakno never too late!

[20:10:20] * csws reports PublicWiFi for terroristic threats
[20:10:23] <PublicWiFi> :O
[20:10:24] <csws> that needs to be in the topic imo
[20:10:25] <csws> no terrorism
[20:10:27] <estranger> crap the wife just told the builder what line of faucets she wants and color w/o asking me ... its gonna be a like $10k upgrade....... hahah damnit
[20:10:28] <PublicWiFi> LOL
[20:10:31] <PublicWiFi> csws: that would be hilarious
[20:10:42] <sintax> estranger: for faucets??!!
[20:10:44] <PublicWiFi> estranger: better wait till you find out about the other house ;P
[20:11:02] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: but yea your story reminded me of two images
[20:11:04] <Hunterkll> https://i.imgur.com/ZVFrBJr.png
[20:11:06] <estranger> sintax, yeah supply chain is all fucked up right now... everyone is just making chrome and she hates chrome
[20:11:06] <Hunterkll> i found the first one
[20:11:08] <br14> I'm watching the old men on our Board argue about how to reach 'the youth'.  I'm not with it, but even I know billboards and newspaper adds are not going to hit the target auidence
[20:11:15] <csws> lmfao
[20:11:20] <PublicWiFi> LOL
[20:11:26] <csws> those guys are winners
[20:11:27] <int0x1C8> techies obsessed with guns is pretty easy to explain, they are mechanical machines that do really cool shit
[20:11:29] <estranger> so the default chrome faucet is like $150..... the black matte in the style she wants is like $500
[20:11:37] <sintax> estranger: makes sense. i've heard of builders literally stopping on houses and just saying fuck it. when it comes in we will do it. 
[20:11:38] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: here's the other one https://i.imgur.com/rnmKteb.png
[20:11:48] <estranger> kitchen, butler closet, 5 bathrooms... it all adds up
[20:11:56] <PublicWiFi> LOL!!
[20:12:03] <PublicWiFi> kentucky man or florida man
[20:12:05] <PublicWiFi> hard to tell
[20:12:08] <PublicWiFi> oh a WV man
[20:12:09] <estranger> sintax, yeah.. thats my worry
[20:12:10] <PublicWiFi> even better
[20:12:12] <PublicWiFi> lmfao
[20:12:17] <sintax> estranger: good luck!
[20:12:17] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: but i think that one's legit fake from a satire site
[20:12:22] <estranger> they are ordering stuff now for a completion in september... we will see
[20:12:24] <Hunterkll> still actually sounds reasonable for the area though
[20:12:27] <Hunterkll> which is why it's so good
[20:12:55] <Hunterkll> especically with the paper going how awsome is this guy
[20:12:57] <PublicWiFi> WV has some really, really nice communities (and gated communities)
[20:13:02] <PublicWiFi> and it has some really, really rough places
[20:13:04] <PublicWiFi> lol
[20:13:22] <PublicWiFi> guess you can say that about any state though honestly
[20:13:35] <Hunterkll> or louisiana
[20:13:43] <Hunterkll> isn't louisiana like #50 in every m etric that matters
[20:13:43] <vinrock> estranger make sure the contractor isnt buying moen stuff from home despot
[20:13:44] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:13:44] <int0x1C8> holy shit "I know they'll all testify against me so let me make something clear: I pissed in every bottle."
[20:13:48] <int0x1C8> fucking legend
[20:13:53] <vinrock> they have the exact same part numbers but the home depot stuff has plastic internals
[20:13:55] <vinrock> its fuckin garbage

[20:14:36] <vinrock> loosiana
[20:14:49] <sintax> i just want to go fishing. ponds by me are thawing nicely. 
[20:14:50] <vinrock> louisiana is prety awesome
[20:15:02] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:15:07] <vinrock> it was one of my favorite places in the deep south
[20:15:12] <Hunterkll> "Plus, if you're them, and you see this guy, selling this drink, and you still buy it, that's on you"
[20:15:13] <PublicWiFi> sintax: i saw the weather channel doing an entire segment on the great lakes freezing
[20:15:17] <PublicWiFi> that must be a big deal or something?
[20:15:17] <estranger> vinrock, they told us all their suppliers... they give us a budget for everything, and anything over we pay the vendor directly 
[20:15:22] <estranger> I kinda like that setup
[20:15:23] <vinrock> ah nice
[20:15:24] <PublicWiFi> does it affect the weather if the water is frozen?
[20:15:29] <sintax> PublicWiFi: it's great when they freeze. we end up with a cooler summer
[20:15:33] <estranger> their budgets are pretty good too
[20:15:37] <PublicWiFi> oh that's dope
[20:15:37] <vinrock> did you get any land or is it just a standard size lot
[20:15:44] <estranger> vinrock, 1.67 acres

[20:15:50] <vinrock> oh shit

[20:48:36] <estranger> slget/ad
[20:48:38] <estranger> err
[20:48:43] <vinrock> everything i know about capitol one is that they are one of the few decent companies that doesnt totaly buttfuck their customers
[20:48:45] <PattyCakes> I've yet to get any "amazing" deals with them
[20:48:55] <Hunterkll> PattyCakes: lol first time I tried to open a regular non-360 checking account with capital one at a branch office, they were like "uhm, someone's using that SSN in florida, you'll have to bring the physical card in for us to verify"
[20:49:03] <vinrock> didnt they just announce they were getting rid of some common fee
[20:49:06] <Hunterkll> PattyCakes: it's not about deals, it's mainly CS & stuff they offer 
[20:49:12] <estranger> I might do Capone... wife and I have a joint CC there
[20:49:13] <Hunterkll> for USAA
[20:49:21] <PattyCakes> I mean, their customer service isn't any better than say Cap One
[20:49:22] <PattyCakes> or my local CU
[20:49:25] <estranger> should be easy to open a joint savings
[20:49:33] <Hunterkll> PattyCakes: raising my ATM limits is annoying with capone
[20:49:37] <Hunterkll> usaa just like a few taps in the app 
[20:49:40] <PattyCakes> ^
[20:49:46] <PattyCakes> Like I said, I don't do checking through cap one
[20:49:59] <Hunterkll> PattyCakes: yea, :USAA i'm talking about, ch ecking, savings, credit cards, insurance, etc
[20:50:05] <PattyCakes> I know
[20:50:05] <Hunterkll> i've got a smattering of USAA products, but their checking is my primary thing
[20:50:12] <PattyCakes> yea same
[20:50:26] <PattyCakes> they are my flood insurance underwriter, along with my checking and life insurance
[20:50:30] <Hunterkll> i've had some amazing help at like 3AM while trying to draw out a few thousand at the casino ATM 
[20:50:36] <vinrock> hunterkll you get that because you work for a gov contractor or did you serve?
[20:50:39] <PattyCakes> but their loans and credit products I haven't foudn to be amazing
[20:50:42] <PattyCakes> and tgheir car insurance fucking sucks
[20:50:49] <Hunterkll> vinrock: prior service, contractor doesn't get you into usaa
[20:50:53] <vinrock> ah no shit
[20:51:03] <PattyCakes> I cheated.
[20:51:06] <PattyCakes> I kinda worked for them.
[20:51:07] <Hunterkll> vinrock: adult child of usaa member or some service tie, is basically what you need
[20:51:08] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:51:19] <PattyCakes> or if you worked there pre 2017 Hunterkll 
[20:51:25] <estranger> my brother was in the service
[20:51:26] <Hunterkll> Nasa FCU let me join because of the contracting company i work for though
[20:51:33] <estranger> that's it
[20:51:45] <PattyCakes> My step brother has Navy Fed
[20:51:52] <PattyCakes> he still qualified even after failing out of basic
[20:51:55] <PattyCakes> that kinda irks me
[20:51:59] <Hunterkll> usaheh
[20:52:03] <Hunterkll> me and navy fed are on bad terms
[20:52:06] <vinrock> failing out of basic
[20:52:07] <vinrock> lawl
[20:52:24] <Hunterkll> still have a savings account with them, but until I pay back what I took from them in my bankruptcy i can't use anything else but branch services in person for savings
[20:52:25] <Hunterkll> :P
[20:52:25] <PattyCakes> vinrock, turns out of you tell the command officer you are having naughty thoughts
[20:52:25] <vinrock> i know one of those stolen valor dudes that went awol during basic
[20:52:29] <PattyCakes> that gets you medically disqual'd
[20:52:37] <Hunterkll> PattyCakes: not anymore
[20:52:37] <vinrock> he tels stories about BEING IN THE SHIT and were all like bro
[20:52:37] <Hunterkll> :D
[20:52:40] <vinrock> weve known you since highschool
[20:52:48] <vinrock> you jetted from basic and you ran to my house wtf are yout alking about
[20:52:51] <Hunterkll> gay dont get you thrown out now
[20:52:52] <Hunterkll> lol
[20:53:01] <PattyCakes> no Hunterkll, he was having the other kind of naughty thoughts
[20:53:04] *** Joins: wac (~wac@user/wac)
[20:53:11] <vinrock> ew
[20:53:15] <Hunterkll> oh
[20:53:15] <PattyCakes> the kind of thoughts you don't want a person to have when they are issued a service weapon
[20:53:15] <PattyCakes> lol
[20:53:17] <Hunterkll> yea that's an easy way out
[20:53:25] <PattyCakes> he wasn't even trying to get out
[20:53:37] <Hunterkll> oh
[20:53:43] <Hunterkll> the i wanna kill motherfuckers right now kind then
[20:53:49] <PattyCakes> more himself
[20:53:50] <PattyCakes> less others
[20:53:59] <PattyCakes> he just wanted some mental health support
[20:54:04] <PattyCakes> and the navy was like "hahahah nothx, bai
[20:54:09] <Hunterkll> yea 
[20:54:12] <Hunterkll> that's what i initially thought
[20:54:14] <Hunterkll> that's a quick RSP 
[20:54:40] <vinrock> yeah i wouldnt want a private pyle on my watch
[20:55:03] <Hunterkll> that's pretty m uch impossible
[20:55:40] <PattyCakes> he really just wanted someone to talk to in the chain of command (health officer or whatever)
[20:55:48] <PattyCakes> the navy straight up just said "nope" and cut him
[20:55:56] <Hunterkll> well, yea, it's a bit too early for that shit
[20:56:11] <PattyCakes> the thing that irks me? He got honorably discharged
[20:56:14] <PattyCakes> he qualifies for all the perks
[20:56:19] <Hunterkll> not..... quite
[20:56:25] <PattyCakes> well, yea I guess
[20:56:35] <PattyCakes> but he's got medical coverage through the navy still, not sure how that works
[20:56:40] <Hunterkll> general discharge / general under honorable, though a lot of those do eventually just get systemically upgrded if there's anything else 
[20:56:45] <Hunterkll> well, if he has tricare there'se more here to the story 
[20:56:46] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Patty you reallllly gotta fuck up to get a dishonerable
[20:57:02] <Hunterkll> bad conduct and dishonerable can only be issued as the result of a courtsmartial
[20:57:04] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> like felony level stuff
[20:57:06] <PattyCakes> One woul think that if you don't make basic, you don't get an honorable or a dishonerable
[20:57:18] <Hunterkll> other than that, you have admin sep, generael under less than honorable, general, general under honorable, or honorable
[20:57:28] <Hunterkll> and admin sep is registered as general iirc
[20:57:37] <PattyCakes> oh shit, you right Hunterkll
[20:57:38] <PattyCakes> he got a general discharge
[20:57:39] <PattyCakes> not honerable
[20:57:40] <Hunterkll> you basically get general under honorable or honorable unless you really fucked up 
[20:57:52] <Hunterkll> yea, but thos often get systemically upgraded if they're under honorable or whatever 
[20:58:04] <Hunterkll> still an ELS (entry level separation) but in records searches and shit doesnt hurt your future
[20:58:28] <PattyCakes> [11:26:45]  <Hunterkll> well, if he has tricare there'se more here to the story 
[20:58:28] <Hunterkll> probably has an RE-3F or similar re-enlistment code 
[20:58:30] <PattyCakes> whatda mean?
[20:58:41] <Hunterkll> PattyCakes: ELS's don't qualify for tricare 
[20:58:43] <Hunterkll> among other things
[20:58:47] <PattyCakes> I'm not well versed in a ton of this. Huh
[20:59:01] <PattyCakes> I know his medical is stirll through the navy, or maybe he's a liar idk
[20:59:04] <Hunterkll> hell, even a 4 year honorably discharged 
[20:59:16] *** Joins: fcinq (~irc@46.105.34.51)
[20:59:32] <Hunterkll> wait no they'd get tricare iirc
[21:00:08] <PattyCakes> So he just told me, he didn't fail out of basic. He graduated the navy academy in Chicago
[21:00:12] <PattyCakes> he was discharged shortly AFTER that
[21:00:17] <Hunterkll> ah
[21:00:19] <Hunterkll> that makes more sense
[21:00:24] <Hunterkll> past the 6 month mark and all that

[21:03:00] <Hunterkll> wasn't that bad
[21:03:13] <Hunterkll> mcj: erm, install printer, share it? 
[21:03:17] <Hunterkll> it hasn't really changed ;X
[21:03:29] <PattyCakes> Hunterkll, I started his around the same time
[21:03:35] <mcj> I wish! But the new patches that happened due to PrintNightmare are causing 0x0000011b errors on clients
[21:03:37] <PattyCakes> early dec iirc
[21:03:47] <PattyCakes> just a FUCK ton of paperwork Hunterkll 
[21:03:51] <Hunterkll> is that just happening to you now?
[21:03:51] <Hunterkll> lol
[21:03:51] <mcj> The fix is to undo the patch... but there has to be a more proper way.
[21:04:02] <PattyCakes> I basically have his entire life via paperwork in my hands
[21:04:03] <mcj> Yeah more or less, users finally returning to the office haha
[21:04:15] <Hunterkll> mcj: yes, proper point and print configuration, or use $deployment_tool_of_choice to pre-install the drivers for your print serer printers on every workstation 
[21:04:26] <PattyCakes> sheme I kinda like the man, else I'd absolutely be stealing his identity
[21:04:31] <Hunterkll> if the driver's pre-installed, adding the printer just works
[21:04:41] <PattyCakes> man has had 2 credit cards his entire life, fucking 748 credit score
[21:05:53] <PattyCakes> trying to get his loan underwritten before interest rates climb any further. We're working on his service validation now

[21:13:30] <PattyCakes> I try and over pay by a misdge
[21:13:37] <Hunterkll> but yea the IRS calculator tries to get you as close to 0 without going under

[21:58:14] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> and I'd also need to find a way to boil it.
[21:58:23] <PattyCakes> that's the easy part
[21:58:43] <PattyCakes> build camp fire around barrel, light camp fire

[21:59:15] <PattyCakes> hehe
[21:59:19] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> And it needs to be a nice, hot, roaring boil.
[21:59:20] <PattyCakes> yea, my solution assumes a lot of things
[21:59:51] <PattyCakes> if you're within actual city limts, generally burning is prohibited (obviously local laws differ everywhere)
[22:00:08] <PattyCakes> but it's safe to assume that within the city, no burning (outside of specific fire pits and fire places)
[22:00:26] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Ja.

[22:42:28] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> Making a basin, and heating up coals in a dutch oven with the blowtorch.
[22:42:35] <PattyCakes> when dealing with AC power, volts is where you need to be concerned (Yes, amps kill, but volts are gonna be what constricts your muscles so you continue holding onto the 600amp line)
[22:43:16] <PattyCakes> a quick zap by household electric will wake you up, but unless you take a bath with a toaster, most power in a standard US house is not going to kill you
[22:43:44] <haise01> Hunterkll: holy fuck thats a nice boom
[22:44:18] <PattyCakes> @yukk - that'll work. Not sure you need the blow torch

[22:44:41] <PattyCakes> the proper way? slowly
[22:44:46] <PattyCakes> you don't wanna burn up the coals with the torch

[22:44:54] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> right.
[22:45:27] <Hunterkll> shakygator: yea, you need a mix of soap flakes and gasoline 
[22:45:34] <sd> 09<Y​ukk> 🤔

[22:45:58] <PattyCakes> makes things easier simply cause fuck lighters and their childproof mechnisms
[22:46:15] <PattyCakes> but it's not to hold heat on the coals for minutes, it's to start your chimney
[22:46:19] <Hunterkll> soap flakes work far better than Styrofoam 
[22:46:50] <PattyCakes> some "grillers" think a chimey is cheating and makes your coals uneaven heating wise

[23:14:46] <DOMF> Why is Samsung calling their new tablet "S8" if it's 14.6"
[23:15:01] <Hunterkll> series 8 
[23:15:09] <DOMF> my current samsung tablets are called "10.2" because they're "10.2 inches"
[23:15:14] <Hunterkll> just like the galaxy S10 isn't bigger than the galxy S8
[23:15:25] <Hunterkll> and my note 10 isn't bigger than the note 9 or w/e was before it
[23:15:32] <Hunterkll> just aligning the branding i guess
[23:15:34] <vinrock> i just ordered an s22 ultra
[23:15:43] <vinrock> goin from a note10+
[23:15:59] <mistiry> was the galaxy s2 only 2" screen? lol
[23:16:13] <DOMF> I think that's dumb
[23:16:36] <DOMF> being able to tell what generation it is from the name isn't as useful as being able to tell the size
[23:16:59] <DOMF> (Although my aforementioned ones do both cause it's the "Galaxy Tab 10.2 2014 edition"
[23:17:19] <PublicWiFi> is exchange using 90%+ CPU 24/7 normal lol, It's got 8 vCPUs
[23:17:26] <vinrock> i thnk theyre just trying t standardize the naming convention
[23:17:33] <PublicWiFi> seems.. high
[23:17:34] <vinrock> they also dropped the note series and renamed it the ultra
[23:17:45] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: depends on how powerful/contested those vCPUs are, the w orkload, how much RAM exchange has, how fast the storage is, etc
[23:17:45] <DOMF> I want to get a cheap android tablet just for reading books and comic books on
[23:18:02] <shakygator> cheap tablets have shitty procs though so they are slow and mostly unusable IME
[23:18:03] <PublicWiFi> Hunterkll: storage is.. decent. it has 24GB of ram, like 100 mailboxes
[23:18:06] <PublicWiFi> its a small install tbh
[23:18:12] <Hunterkll> what version?
[23:18:17] <PublicWiFi> 2016
[23:18:19] <PublicWiFi> latest CU
[23:18:20] <Hunterkll> eh
[23:18:23] <vinrock> if you pre order one of the new samsung phones now they're giving you the option of picking up the S8 tab for half price
[23:18:31] <PublicWiFi> I didn't want to keep adding CPUs if this is just the nature of hte beast
[23:18:44] <PublicWiFi> I know it hogs RAM, not sure how it can "hog" cpu time lol
[23:19:03] <Hunterkll> too many/too few CPUs for design, fucky garbage collection, etc
[23:19:07] <PublicWiFi> system is what's using the CPU time
[23:19:09] <Hunterkll> it's possible to give exchange too much ram and CPU 
[23:19:21] <Hunterkll> that's why it has upper limits
[23:19:24] <Hunterkll> and lower
[23:19:33] <PublicWiFi> i've never heard of giving it TOO much
[23:19:35] <Hunterkll> it's designed to work well .NET GC and all that jazz wise 
[23:19:43] <DOMF> <shakygator> cheap tablets have shitty procs though so they are slow and mostly unusable IME <-- unusable if the only thing I want it for is just reading comic books?
[23:19:48] <Hunterkll> oh yea you'll fuck up the garbage collection in .NET that it's calibrated for
[23:20:00] <shakygator> idk i couldnt even browse the web on my $200 nvda shield
[23:20:06] <DOMF> I really just need an ereader but they don't make big colored ereaders
[23:20:13] <shakygator> it played games okay cuz it had a fuck ton of GPUs but was otherwise dog shit
[23:20:28] <Hunterkll> PublicWiFi: 2016's reccomended max CPU core count and ram is 192GB
[23:20:31] <PublicWiFi> oh you shouldn't go above 24 CPUs
[23:20:32] <Hunterkll> and 24 cores
[23:20:32] *** Joins: tex (~super@user/dix)
[23:20:34] <DOMF> I won't even need a browser on it
[23:20:35] <PublicWiFi> yeah
[23:20:37] <PublicWiFi> cores*
[23:20:43] <Hunterkll> it fucks with load distro/.net stuff/etc
[23:20:47] <DOMF> so, bonus if it's rootable and I can remove tons of bloatware crap
[23:20:49] <Hunterkll> you also shouldn't virtualize exchange but whatevs :P
[23:20:57] <PublicWiFi> im at 8
[23:21:00] <PublicWiFi> yeah I know you shouldn't but meh
[23:21:18] <PublicWiFi> maybe ill toss it a couple more, but given my small mailbox count I feel like it shouldn't be pegged out as it is
[23:21:33] <PublicWiFi> oh well, I'm hopefully moving to o365 and then setting up a hybrid box anyway
[23:21:36] <PublicWiFi> soonish
[23:21:54] <mistiry> i dont manage exchange so idk, but curious - why no virtualizing?
[23:22:31] <DOMF> virtualizing it means you're using it and you shouldn't use exchane
[23:22:32] <DOMF> ;)
[23:22:35] * DOMF ducks
[23:22:41] <DOMF> *exchange
[23:22:44] <shakygator> last time i managed exchange it was a VM
[23:22:45] <shakygator> was fine
[23:22:51] *** Quits: n0xff (~0xff@gateway/tor-sasl/n0xff) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[23:22:52] <shakygator> wasnt crazy busy though, SMB
[23:23:12] <Hunterkll> mistiry: it's architecture / design is tilted to cheap commodity mass storage without RAID or disk caching in a multi-box resiliancy scenario 
[23:23:15] <DOMF> P sure our exchange is in aws, so virtualized
[23:23:40] <PublicWiFi> I'd say almost all places virtualize them
[23:23:45] <mistiry> we had it virtualized at the last place i was at
[23:23:46] <PublicWiFi> unless you're in the 2000+ range
[23:23:47] <Hunterkll> mistiry: it expects to have hardware diddly access for best data protection and performance as well
[23:23:53] <PublicWiFi> 2000+ mailboxes
[23:23:58] <mistiry> but that was in place before me. we didndt have issues from it afaik
[23:24:10] <PublicWiFi> it just has high resource reqs
[23:24:11] <Hunterkll> the way exchange is designed, the way to do actual native protection and performance the smallest setup is 8 boxes : P
[23:24:21] <Hunterkll> 4 exchange serers, 2 SMTP transport edge servers, 2 load balancers
[23:24:24] <mistiry> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/plan-and-deploy/virtualization?view=exchserver-2019
[23:24:34] <Hunterkll> yea you have to take all those considerations into account
[23:24:37] <Hunterkll> it's sup ported and all that
[23:24:38] <Hunterkll> but then again
[23:24:45] <Hunterkll> installing exchange on a domain controller is also officially supported

[23:50:39] <vinrock> nice, moscow times is just as bad as american media
[23:50:53] <vinrock> the kids were arrested for making bombs and training to commit terrorist acts
[23:50:56] <vinrock> “undergoing training for the purpose of carrying out terrorist activities” 
[23:51:00] <vinrock> they videotaped themselves making bombs
[23:51:06] <vinrock> and the one kids mother confirmed it
[23:51:07] <Hunterkll> vinrock: that's what the court said
[23:51:15] <vinrock> the one kids mom said they were making bombs
[23:51:26] <Hunterkll> like, that's what the court convicted them of
[23:51:28] <Hunterkll> not some media spin
[23:51:32] <Hunterkll> that's the actual name of the charge
[23:51:47] <vinrock> i know the media spin im talkin about is saying they were arrested and convicted for threatening to blow up a virtual building in minecraft
[23:51:58] <vinrock> so people would be like 'godamn russia is ass backards'
