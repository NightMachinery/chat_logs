[03:14:08] <thunder> because that's a romantic/poetic allegory
[03:14:21] <tomathy> can u briefly say the myth?
[03:15:15] <thunder> https://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/Psykhe.html
[03:15:15] <ro-bot-o> [url] PSYCHE (Psykhe) - Greek Goddess of the Soul | www.theoi.com
[03:15:19] <causative> soul isn't the same as psyche, the psyche is something compatible with a materialist perspective whereas a soul is supposedly something different from your brain or body
[03:15:34] <apotheon> Psyche came to have a somewhat different meaning in English, though -- thanks in part to those who followed Jung.
[03:15:49] <thunder> superman is both a marvel and dc comic character
[03:15:52] <causative> the soul is said to reincarnate or go to heaven or transmigrate or whatever, the psyche is just the mind
[03:16:03] <causative> the mind depends entirely on the brain
[03:16:15] <thunder> the mind reincarnates when we communicate and empathize with each other
[03:16:24] <thunder> and when we have offspring
[03:16:48] <causative> only in a very metaphorical way
[03:17:07] <causative> it's not literal reincarnation, it's just sharing your mind-patterns with others
[03:17:17] <thunder> because it is a metaphor. if you take that stuff literally, it's religion, not philosophy
[03:17:25] <tomathy> i think hell is a nightclub tbh, if God is good, surely hell is just the choice to sin
[03:17:29] <causative> the soul is a religious concept
[03:17:52] <thunder> this is a philosophy channel
[03:18:13] <causative> when you say "soul" even in philosophy, you're talking about the kind of soul that religious believers talk about
[03:18:25] <thunder> speak for yourself
[03:18:27] <causative> i.e. some mysterious ghostly thing that passes on after death to other places
[03:18:38] <thunder> when I say it, I'm just using a poetic inference to refer to the psyche
[03:18:55] <causative> well, it causes confusion, because most people will have these religious associations with it
[03:19:03] <causative> if you mean psyche then say psyche

[03:22:18] <thunder> causative: I forgot we had that convo tbh
[03:22:36] <thunder> you see my point though?
[03:22:53] <thunder> if you take it metaphorically rather than literally...
[03:23:00] <causative> no, what I said then stands now
[03:23:17] <causative> which is that it depends on what you mean by "shakespeare's plays" - there are several different senses by which we may interpret this phrase
[03:23:41] <causative> some of these senses can be said to go away on the physical destruction of the work, others remain, and others never existed
[03:23:58] <tomathy> he means the metaphysical entity of shakespeares plays you pedant
[03:24:26] <causative> does this "metaphysical entity" exist now?
[03:24:39] <tomathy> either its corruption or it itself does exist
[03:24:57] <causative> I say no - I reserve the word "exist" for things that are physically real in this universe
[03:25:19] <tomathy> but it also exists physically
[03:25:28] <thunder> in early christian theology the body and soul while distinct experiences were not considered separable. according to augustine of hippo "your body is your wife". that reflects a pan-indo-european metaphor of the female representing the material existence, whereas the male represents the mental/psychic which it embodies.
[03:25:48] <causative> the metaphysical entity of "shakespeare's plays" does not exist physically any more than the integers exist physically
[03:25:53] <thunder> similar idea to sabbath homolka
[03:26:12] <causative> what exists physically is physical instantiations of the metaphysical entity, which are not the same as the metaphysical entity itself
[03:26:25] <causative> this is what I mean about keeping the different senses separate, not conflating them

[03:27:43] <causative> line 11, "To make someone look bad is to refute them."
[03:28:17] <tomathy> so causative you are a pure idealist?
[03:28:33] <causative> "idealist" is an ambiguous label in philosophy
[03:28:48] <thunder> causative: the psyche can be likened to your metaphysical object, whereas the body is the physical which gives it form and a vessel. isn't that analogous to the concept of a non-material soul?
[03:29:26] <causative> tomathy, I hold that when we make up imaginary worlds, like the world of Hamlet, these worlds do not exist
[03:29:45] <causative> they can be interesting or useful, but that does not grant them existence - they are still imaginary
[03:30:00] <causative> fictional
[03:30:16] <causative> what exists is representations of the worlds, in our minds or in our text, not the worlds themselves
[03:30:20] <tomathy> my point about the mirror i think is that if you have some object that is physical like a letter or will for what to do with your body/money, then it exists physically. so we can say shakespeares play exists physically. there's nothing wrong with that idea. the fact that it isn't identical to the metaphysical entity doesn't matter so much imo
[03:30:54] <tomathy> because it CAN'T be identical to it
[03:31:07] <causative> yes, that's exactly what I said earlier - we need to keep the different senses separate
[03:31:15] <causative> the physical play is not the same as the metaphysical entity
[03:31:49] <causative> when we destroy the physical play, we have not destroyed the metaphysical entity - in fact, if by "the metaphysical entity" we mean the world of Hamlet and the things that happened to Hamlet, those things never existed
[03:32:18] <tomathy> but perhaps the soul of shakespeare has seen a modern play of his and is so in love with it that he proclaims from the afterlife: THAT IS MY PLAY, OR BETTER. IT IS MORE MY PLAY THAN MY PLAY
[03:33:17] <causative> that is possible
[03:33:17] <tomathy> i haven't even read hamlet
[03:34:25] <causative> what he would mean by this statement is, that he had some goals that he wanted to realize when he made Hamlet - a vision, consisting of certain notions of the ways things ought to be in the play that he tried to combine to form the actual lines of the play
[03:34:46] <causative> and that the modern version of the play realized those goals better than the original
[03:34:56] <apotheon> Hamlet's quite good.

[03:45:20] <thunder> psyche is the most inclusive term I can think of

[03:57:46] <causative> anyway the crazy believer doesn't need to be insane by society's standards - e.g. a fundamentalist Christian who kills an abortion doctor might think he's being compassionate towards the unborn babies

[03:57:52] <ro-bot-o> [url] Abstract 22b | vlepy.github.io
[03:57:55] <Varde> Etc
[03:58:04] <causative> and he might be relatively sane, just religious
[03:58:09] <tomathy> compassion without truth is like when a blind person you look beautiful
[03:58:17] <tomathy> says+
[03:58:22] <tomathy> what's wrong with that
[03:58:50] <causative> nothing's wrong with that, but that's not the only example of compassion without truth - the abortion doctor murder I described is another
[03:59:37] <Varde> Compassion without willingness is nothing but malpractice.
[04:00:04] <Varde> Foolish politeness.
[04:00:06] <causative> lots of people think they're being compassionate, they act with good intentions, but they may cause great harm
[04:00:11] <causative> if they do not understand the truth
[04:00:20] <causative> "the road to hell is paved with good intentions" is the saying
[04:01:06] <causative> the reason good intentions can lead you to "hell" (a bad outcome) is that you acted based on incorrect information
[04:01:25] <causative> or incomplete information
[04:01:28] <tomathy> that saying is decrying idleness not compassion
[04:01:44] <Varde> The passerby is a stranger, to say one is beautiful without any will is deadly to thought, you may as well show a passerby disgust and for the most part you'll both avoid disappointment.
[04:01:52] <causative> no tomathy that's not how I have heard it
[04:02:14] <causative> that saying is used when someone tries to do something good - they're not idle, they're acting - but the outcome is bad
[04:02:29] <tomathy> ok
[04:02:33] <tomathy> i believe you
[04:02:45] <tomathy> but it's not compassion
[04:02:56] <causative> sure it is - compassion is a good intention
[04:03:38] <tomathy> where was the compassion for the victim?
[04:04:19] <tomathy> compassion is not selective
[04:04:22] <tomathy> so it is NOT compassion
[04:04:22] <causative> sometimes it is truly the right action to kill a villain to save others - this is compassionate
[04:04:41] <Delf> What the fudge?
[04:04:42] <causative> but it's only right if the one killed is truly a villain, and we truly save others by doing so
[04:04:44] <tomathy> you're stupid
[04:04:50] <causative> here's another example
[04:04:57] <causative> suppose that a person thinks that denying aid to the homeless is compassionate because they will get a job and stand on their own two feet.  When the truth is that this homeless person needs mental health care and will die in a ditch if he does not get it.
[04:04:58] * tomathy stabs causative 
[04:05:15] * Delf blocks tomathy from stabbing
[04:05:16] <thunder> even the dalai lama said he'd kill a lion if it attacked him
[04:05:25] * tomathy pucnhes delf
[04:05:53] * Delf successfully dodges punch
[04:05:59] * tomathy runs away
[04:06:07] <causative> in the homeless example, there is nobody being killed or attacked - the person is being denied aid on the theory that it will help them in the long run
[04:06:22] <causative> but in fact in this example it won't, they need aid or will die
[04:06:31] <causative> so compassion in this case caused harm
[04:06:35] <causative> because of a lack of truth
[04:06:36] <Delf> thunder: I'd kill a dalai lama if he killed a lion
[04:07:31] * tomathy loads his bazooka
[04:08:07] <Varde> If I try to be beneficent to an objective, there is good. If I try to be good generally, there is no beneficence, have you ever noticed that? Good is nonsensical understanding of morality(that which is a duality) - you wouldn't understand magnets if you took positive as a singularity. Therefore, there is no general good, only meta of the fact. There is objective good(this is meta) but philosophy says otherwise...
[04:08:53] <causative> I would also say that truth *results* in compassion - what is empathy, but an understanding of the mental states of others?  And does not empathy lead to sympathy and kindness?
[04:09:34] <causative> if we simply understand the inner workings of other people's minds, we become more sympathetic to their inner struggles, because we understand them

[04:09:52] <Delf> That does not mean that we will become kind to them
[04:09:59] <causative> it usually means we will be kinder
[04:10:15] <Delf> Maybe, if you're lucky
[04:10:53] <causative> to kill enemies in war, we dehumanize them - make them into caricatures.  Because if we deeply understood them, we would be much less willing to kill them.

[04:11:37] <causative> knowing a person has a family, has dreams and aspirations, has a lover, is much like us in his mind - all these things make it harder to hurt them, make it more likely that we will be kind to them.  And they are just the truth.  Knowing the truth about people makes us kinder to them.

[04:11:46] <apotheon> 00:22 < causative> if we want to improve our virtue the first thing is to develop a process that is good for finding the truth - this is not a dogma that leaders insist is the truth, it is a process that *tends* towards the truth, such as science or math
[04:11:50] <apotheon> philosophy in a nutshell
[04:12:06] <causative> sure, hopefully philosophy tends towards the truth
[04:12:07] <apotheon> 00:23 < causative> from truth, virtue will follow
[04:12:20] <apotheon> In the meantime, we should try to get as close as possible with our limited information.
[04:12:21] *** Parts: mannequin (uid453465@id-453465.helmsley.irccloud.com) ()
[04:12:36] <tomathy> this is where you realise philosophy is not everything it's made out to be when people attack compassion
[04:13:00] <tomathy> it's like a bear denouncing fur
[04:13:07] <causative> you shouldn't think of it in such binary terms tomathy , no one is denouncing compassion
[04:13:39] <thunder> I agree on the developing of a process for finding truth as a good means of cultivating virtue
[04:13:45] <causative> It is on the whole good, but we are saying it is sometimes insufficient, when compassion is combined with falsehoods it can cause harm.  But when combined with truths it can cause benefit.
[04:13:56] <apotheon> 00:27 < mannequin> check my new shiny footer: https://vlepy.github.io/2021/11/07/anstract22b.html
[04:13:56] <ro-bot-o> [url] Abstract 22b | vlepy.github.io
[04:14:07] <apotheon> I see two problems with that footer, at least.
[04:14:24] <thunder> truth is a choice though. by whatever means of comparison we choose what we regard to be true over that which is perceived as less so
[04:14:45] <causative> it's a special kind of choice
[04:15:02] <Varde> Philosophy is a commanding protocol, i.e. a process we need to undergo, prior to mental development. Think, before you process scientifically, you theorise philosophically. Before you goto the shop, you either think about what to buy or you figure out a sum.
[04:15:32] <apotheon> 00:42 < causative> sure, hopefully philosophy tends towards the truth
[04:15:33] <thunder> I feel that the primary underlying criteria for a *sense of* truth is the internal consistency, coherence and mutual support provided by the associated thoughts and emotions
[04:15:41] <apotheon> Philosophy is the attempt to tend toward truth.
[04:15:54] <apotheon> Whether it does or not is just a measure of how well you're using it.
[04:16:04] <apotheon> same with science
[04:16:07] <thunder> what is wisdom?
[04:16:11] <Varde> That's a deep association, I think on the surface it's much simpler.
[04:17:09] <causative> thunder, the most important way we seek truth, is that we use some sort of thinking process, P, that yields truths.  And if P yields something that we obviously think is false - e.g. P is telling us we should be seeing the elevator go up, when we clearly see the elevator is going down - then we must reject or amend P
[04:17:14] <thunder> imo wisdom is that which guides actions reliably towards a favourable outcome for the intended recipients
[04:17:27] <causative> "what leads to falsehood must be flawed"
[04:17:31] <tomathy> can i change the subject to something imo more interesting?
[04:17:37] <causative> modus tollens
[04:17:38] <Varde> You lean toward truth in the theory process to generate accurate thesises, but properly, what philosophy is, is command of mind(how/why are deeper questions: a deep answer, leaning toward truth).
[04:18:01] <Varde> You finish though...
[04:18:09] <causative> through repeated applications of modus tollens in this way, we weed out thinking processes that lead to falsehoods, leaving only thinking processes that lead to truths
[04:18:26] <causative> this is how machine learning works
[04:18:33] <thunder> causative: I agree from a purely dry intellectual framework, but we are not vulcans from star trek. just as frequently our ideas of "truth" are so conceived because of the emotional congruence they provide us
[04:18:42] <apotheon> Too bad machine learning is largely reserved for metric optimization.
[04:18:45] <apotheon> (as a goal)
[04:18:55] <causative> well, emotional congruence is not a process that reliably leads us to truths
[04:19:01] <thunder> really?
[04:19:11] <thunder> I don't concur on that tbh
[04:19:21] <causative> the appeal of Qanon, or religions, is all about emotional congruence
[04:19:21] <apotheon> I do.
[04:19:28] <causative> people believe what feels good to believe
[04:19:32] <causative> and it's all wrong
[04:19:37] <apotheon> Emotional congruence is far from reliable in its approach to truth.
[04:19:42] <causative> the fact is that the truth often hurts
[04:19:44] <causative> it often feels bad
[04:19:58] <causative> and to be rational we have to accept the pain and forge onward
[04:20:07] <thunder> denying the role which emotions play in human behaviour and relationships, is to put blinders on to the greater part of what motivates us
[04:20:21] <apotheon> Who said anything about denying it has a role?
[04:20:25] <causative> nobody's putting *blinders* on about it
[04:20:35] <thunder> when you have a mature emotional disposition, it is a tremendous source of insight into the world, particularly of humans and other animals
[04:20:35] <causative> we're saying it's there, important, and often *bad*
[04:20:46] <apotheon> well
[04:20:47] <Varde> Emotions are felt, they are not feelings, per se.
[04:20:54] <apotheon> often bad at approaching truth
[04:21:00] <apotheon> not necessarily normatively bad
[04:21:01] <Varde> Feeling i.e. touch.
[04:21:16] <Varde> They touch us but are not directly feeling...
[04:21:18] <apotheon> They're feelings, but not feeling.
[04:21:22] <Varde> Ye
[04:21:42] <thunder> if I stand on a hilltop and watch a beautiful sunset feeling a sense of profound awe and beauty, is that not right and true because of the emotions it stirs moreso than the intellectual content it provides?
[04:21:57] <apotheon> kinda like how CDs are recordings, but they aren't recording
[04:22:07] <Varde> Yeah
[04:22:14] <Varde> Stomached.
[04:22:36] <causative> well, it's a valuable experience
[04:22:42] <apotheon> thunder: You're using some poetic definition of truth, and pretty much all of poetry is metaphor, so . . . you're just speaking in metaphors when you say that about emotions.
[04:22:48] <Varde> Emotions are like chords of the internal organism.
[04:22:49] <apotheon> thunder: causative was speaking literally
[04:23:09] <causative> but to say it is "true" is to use the word in a different sense
[04:23:14] <thunder> when we speak of kindness and compassion as a form of truth, is it not similarly founded?
[04:23:18] <apotheon> literal truth versus a sense of authenticity of experience metaphorically described as "truth"
[04:23:21] <causative> it's not "true" in the sense a proposition is true
[04:23:35] <Varde> -1
[04:23:49] <apotheon> Kindness and compassion being "truth" is another metaphorical use.
[04:24:09] <Delf> Emotions get in the way of R&D.
[04:24:16] <thunder> I would contend that most scientists pursue their careers and their search for truth because of the emotions it stirs within them more than the specific intellectual content
[04:24:27] <apotheon> Delf: maybe so, but that's beside the point under discussion
[04:24:28] <Varde> Euphoria is a crowned emotion, ecstacy is a winged emotion.
[04:24:41] <apotheon> thunder: Sure, that's motivation.
[04:24:42] <causative> well yes thunder but that's not the same as saying that the emotions themselves generate truths
[04:24:53] <thunder> isn't it?
[04:24:56] <causative> emotions motivate, but just because we feel good about a proposition does not mean we should accept it as true
[04:25:03] <apotheon> thunder: Our feelings give us the "why", but our process gives us the "what".
[04:25:16] <causative> it's important to be motivated but we should not confuse what we emotionally wish was true with what is true
[04:25:34] <Varde> :)
[04:25:36] <Varde> Happy
[04:25:40] <Varde> Obviously
[04:26:11] <thunder> okay. when scientists are clinging to an idea because they've invested their entire career and good name in it's verity, is the science what's motivating them, or the fear of losing face and career? you might say, that's not science, but in practice it often very much is.
[04:26:28] <Delf> That is not easy when you deal with truth, reality and belief for our mind will get in the way by producing excessive amounts of emotions preventing us from learning
[04:27:11] <apotheon> thunder: That . . . depends.
[04:27:35] <thunder> it's good to keep the two separate, in theory. in reality, you have to contend with the fact they are not.
[04:28:09] <thunder> this is why having a truth which encompasses the emotional content is valuable and in itself a source of truth
[04:28:10] <apotheon> There are so many different ways to interpret your reasoning in the career example that I am not prepared to respond.  I don't really know which potential interpretation you meant to convey.
[04:28:43] <apotheon> thunder: I think you're using two different definitions of "truth" and essentially trying to make them one.
[04:28:44] <Varde> Don't get tangled up in the past, but emotional congruence is definitely a good shot at the future of philosophical thinking on the subject matter.
[04:28:52] <apotheon> . . . which will only confuse things much of the time.
[04:29:07] <thunder> I'm contending that pure rationality is not the only objective "truth"
[04:29:22] <apotheon> Rationality isn't "truth" at all.
[04:29:38] <apotheon> Truth is itself.  It is not something else.
[04:29:39] <Varde> I can't really wrap my head around the why, the best I can call it is 'source'.
[04:29:50] <apotheon> Rationality is an orientation toward seeking and employing truth.
[04:29:52] <thunder> apotheon: that seems like circular reasoning.
[04:30:16] <apotheon> kinda like how greed isn't money -- it's an orientation toward seeking and employing money
[04:30:22] <thunder> what is truth, to recap specifically?
[04:30:56] <apotheon> from a dictionary:
[04:31:13] <apotheon> a. Conformity to fact or actuality: Does this story have any truth?
[04:31:22] <apotheon> b. Reality; actuality: In truth, he was not qualified for the job.
[04:31:37] <Delf> It's something out there... that we're trying to stick inside here
[04:31:42] <apotheon> a good enough starting point
[04:32:56] <thunder> nathaniel branden said words to the effect that there're only 3 basic arguments between people. what exists? (metaphysics); how do you know? (epistemology); so what? (ethics)
[04:33:20] <apotheon> He forgot "semantics".
[04:33:27] <tomathy> dont be anti semantic
[04:33:33] <apotheon> I'm not.
[04:33:36] <Delf> If there's any truth at all, I'd say its everything you don't know, can't know and isn't equipped enough to know. But we use it as a "direction" towards more accurate understanding of things...
[04:33:39] <thunder> in that context, let's skip the metaphysics and presume "truth" is extant. how do you know it when you see it?
[04:33:41] <apotheon> I'm pro-semantic.
[04:33:51] <tomathy> alright dont need to get kinky
[04:33:55] <apotheon> That's why I keep bringing up the fact people are using different definitions of terms.
[04:34:23] <apotheon> thunder: That question is part of the puzzle.
[04:34:28] <thunder> let's arrive at a definition. not just the superficial dictionary description, but a deeper understanding of it's basic nature.
[04:34:40] <thunder> my contention is that truth is a choice made on the basis of coherence between the associated thoughts and/or feelings. but what I seem to be getting from you guys is that emotions have no place in that definition. I'm saying otherwise.
[04:35:02] <apotheon> I don't have time to solve one of the Hard Problems in philosophy tonight, so I guess I'll let you waste time on it.
[04:35:28] <thunder> food for thought
[04:35:55] <apotheon> Yeah, that sense of it you convey doesn't buy me any additional ability to communicate, and in fact detracts from that, so I likely won't use it so much.
[04:36:14] <apotheon> good luck
[04:36:39] <Delf> gg wp gl hf
[04:36:42] <thunder> to me it's not about ability to communicate, but what to communicate
[04:37:02] <apotheon> no clue what you're trying to communicate if you can't communicate
[04:37:29] <Delf> Isn't truth just a threshold for what makes you satisfied with what you think the reality is?

[04:37:44] <apotheon> Delf: only in your definition
[04:37:56] <apotheon> I don't think your statement is true, in other words.
[04:38:12] <Delf> That's not nice... I like people who agree with me. That way I learn nothing :P
[04:38:41] <apotheon> I don't respond well to attempts to destroy capacity for communication.
[04:39:01] <Delf> You insert malevolent intention on behalf of others where there are none.
[04:39:19] <Delf> Communicaition is key for our species to develop
[04:40:16] <Delf> thunder seem to be sincere
[04:40:24] <apotheon> I didn't say anything about intentions.
[04:40:35] <Delf> The fucking guy's communicating alright
[04:40:50] <apotheon> One may believe (falsely) that an attempt to destroy communication capacity is actually something else while doing it.
[04:41:06] <Delf> He's working the thing his trying to communicate
[04:41:40] <apotheon> He needs a different word for it, then, because "truth" being removed from its more established philosophical meaning would leave no word for that concept.
[04:42:09] <apotheon> I'm not asserting his intention is to achieve that end, but his efforts work toward that end.
[04:42:23] <apotheon> (assuming "he")
[04:42:25] <thunder> I can speak of truth in a colloquial sense when I want to communicate mundane things. but when we're discussing philsophy, I figured something with a bit more than superficial insight might be more appropriate
[04:42:31] <apotheon> (correct me if it's incorrect, please)
[04:43:17] <apotheon> So . . . when discussing philosophy, you want to eliminate an important term for philosophical discussion.
[04:43:22] <apotheon> That does not strike me as helpful.
[04:43:32] <apotheon> It's not superficial.
[04:43:36] <apotheon> It's fundamental to the field.
[04:43:40] <thunder> like I can read what a car is in the dictionary, but if I want to be a mechanic, I need to learn how it actually works.
[04:43:50] <apotheon> So?
[04:43:51] <thunder> similarly if we're gonna speak of truth, a little philosophy doesn't hurt
[04:43:57] <apotheon> um
[04:44:05] <apotheon> You're using those words in ways that don't make sense.
[04:44:12] <thunder> to you
[04:44:18] <apotheon> Philosophy is, effectively, the search for truth.
[04:44:21] <Delf> Philosophize
[04:44:27] <thunder> I'm sorry about that, but also guessing we're at an impasse in that respect
[04:44:45] <thunder> how can you find truth if you don't even know how to identify it?
[04:44:51] <thunder> if you don't know what it is?
[04:45:01] <apotheon> If you delete that use of "truth", and replace it with "something that involves how you feel about things", we no longer have philosphy per se.
[04:45:14] <Delf> You find it piece by piece... :P Or rather... you find out what's NOT the truth
[04:45:23] <Delf> That you have previously thought of as truth
[04:45:59] <apotheon> thunder: What's your objection to "authenticity" as a term for what you want?
[04:46:06] <apotheon> Why do you have to hijack "truth"?
[04:46:06] <thunder> I can agree with that Delf. I tend to remind myself of the question by reciting "doubt is custodian of truth"
[04:47:02] <apotheon> Never mind.  I'll just keep in mind that there are certain subjects on which you are unwilling or unable to discourse meaningfully.
[04:47:09] <thunder> apotheon: I'm not hijacking it. I'm contextualizing how we arrive at it in practice. moreover I'm saying if we exclude that context from our understanding of truth, we will blind ourselves to a good chunk of it.
[04:48:29] <Delf> He is neither unwilling nor unable
[04:48:37] <thunder> anyway, as I've already restated this a bunch of times in an apparently futile attempt to get the gist across, I'm gonna bow out and go get some dinner and watch tv. ttyl

[06:05:50] <thunder> his essential distinction is that there's a difference between the recollection of the text we identify as shakespeare's, versus the gist or meaning, what he calls "thought contents" which can be translated between languages.
[06:06:42] <thunder> and that it's this gist which is the true identity of shakespeare's plays, not the text itself whether physical or mental.
[06:07:24] <thunder> of course he says it better in his own words

[06:15:58] <apotheon> thunder: well-put, with regard to Hamlet and Karl Popper
[06:20:54] <thunder> thanks. I'm taking him a little out of context for the sake of our discussion. I encourage you to read his essay. it's worth it imo.
[06:31:45] <apotheon> If I'm not mistaken, Karl was essentially making an ontological case for the substantive existence of abstract objects.
[06:31:56] <thunder> yes
[06:32:19] <thunder> what could be characterized as a "psychic realm"
[06:32:26] <thunder> or astral plane perhaps
[06:32:44] <apotheon> . . . which is interesting, considering things like books and poems are generally addressed in ways more likely assigned to aesthetics and epistemology.

[06:33:08] <thunder> and vice versa
[06:34:00] <apotheon> I'm generally more inclined to regard books and poems in the abstract as emergent properties of human action rather than independent, objective entities.

[06:34:56] <thunder> I haven't entirely decided, but I enjoy entertaining various perspectives to see how they contextualize my experience in an insightful way
[06:35:02] *** Quits: Pixi (~Pixi@user/pixi) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[06:35:09] <apotheon> I do, of course, often refer to them in common objectifying terms.  It makes communicating about them easier for most purposes.  Once in a while, though, I find it quite useful to demystify and, in a sense, depersonify such thing explicitly in conversation.
[06:36:04] <apotheon> Without that, there's nothing to stop someone from getting too wrapped up in the map and ignoring the territory, or somehow attributing "rights" to an abstraction rather than to the people who are intellectually subsumed in the sense of the abstraction.
[06:36:29] <thunder> yes
[06:36:52] <thunder> symbol is custodian of meaning (and vice versa) is how I tend to mnemonicize it
[06:36:59] <apotheon> If anything, I'd take Popper's third realm as the realm of intellectual traps, in a way.  When you give in to the belief in these abstract conveniences as substantive entities in their own right, they compete for primacy with actual people.
[06:37:43] <apotheon> It's the generalization of the idea behind the Judeo-Christian prohibition against worshipping graven images.
[06:38:50] <apotheon> Do not worship the symbol; worship the god.  Do not value the dollar; value the buying power.  Do not follow the laws of government; follow the laws of honest ethics.
[06:39:09] <apotheon> Do not fall in love with the idea of a person; fall in love with the true person, or not at all.
[06:39:35] <thunder> mmm. I think of abrahamic religions as the most idolatrous cults on earth, because of how literally they take their book(s). the fact that they worship a alphabet characters in a certain arrangement is little distinction to me. the relationship they have with their symbols is idolatrous in the extreme.
[06:39:43] <apotheon> When you love a person, both may prosper.  When you love an idea of the person, both may be harmed.
[06:40:08] <thunder> to me the non-representation of the ultimate truth is just respect for it's mystery more than anything.

[06:41:40] <apotheon> . . . but don't mistake the bureaucracy of Abrahamic religious organizations for the honest beliefs of individuals, or you risk falling into the same trap of "idolatry".
[06:42:07] <thunder> there're some christian heretical sects which contend that direct revelation is more authoritative than the text. I say good on them. they're the only one's who can credibly claim not to be idolators imo
[06:42:27] <apotheon> Recognize that individuals may have much less frustratingly constituted beliefs than the idolatrous worship of the literal text of the twelve-times-translated supposed Word of God.
[06:43:06] <thunder> yeah. I'm speaking of extremists. though there do seem to be alot of them.
[06:43:18] <thunder> it's promoted as desirable
[06:43:26] <apotheon> There were some heretical sects that read the Bible and thought "This isn't even consistent.  There are obvious two 'Gods' here."  They became known as Gnostic sects, and had some *very* interesting beliefs.

[06:44:01] <thunder> abrahamic religion got a lot of it's core concepts from neoplatonism
[06:44:56] <thunder> for instance that's where the gnostics got the idea of the demiurge (from plato). the neoplatonists derided them as bastardizing plato in their theology

[12:45:59] <arryana> that's a decision you shouldn't feel qualified to make until you're firsthand educated on the topic.
[12:47:54] <inhahe_> i think I get the gist of biology and chemistry and mechanicism/physicalism enough to decide. the details wouldn't change anything.
[12:48:01] * arryana shrugs
[12:48:14] <arryana> i came three days from amputation, and i've lived in a physical rehab hospital
[12:48:23] <arryana> i've also got a seven inch plate and ten screws in one ankle
[12:48:40] <arryana> though that wasn't the same occasion as the near amputation
[12:48:50] <arryana> i had plates in that one too, but they took them out years ago
[12:49:20] <arryana> what you think you'd choose and what you'd really choose will not be the same thing.
[12:49:25] <arryana> because you'll have learned a lot.
[12:49:45] <inhahe_> well, I said earlier that if I accidentally lost a limb, sure, i'd go for a cybernetic one
[12:49:49] <inhahe_> i just wouldn't opt for it otherwise
[12:50:38] <arryana> i can see people making a different choice, for all sorts of reasons.
[12:50:39] <inhahe_> (or if i were born without one)
[12:51:23] <inhahe_> sure, I just don't like transhumanism, I don't think it's progress, though I'm sure there are valid exceptions
[12:51:27] <arryana> i have no particular problem with it, it will carry its own advantages and penalties, like anything else.
[12:51:41] <arryana> huh
[12:51:51] * arryana shrugs
[12:51:54] <arryana> to me it seems inevitable.
[12:52:08] <inhahe_> it may be, because of our limited awareness + our growing technology
[12:52:15] <arryana> though a lot fewer people will be prepared for longevity than they think
[12:52:26] <inhahe_> like many other problems that combination brings to life
[12:52:27] <arryana> wow, you're more optimistic than i am.
[12:52:31] <I_Am_M00t> 🤔
[12:52:39] <arryana> most people throw away their lives as it is, and waste most of their days.
[12:52:45] <arryana> giving them more time won't change that

[12:55:28] <arryana> that may or may not be true.  if it is, you'd not be the first such i've met.
[12:56:26] <arryana> living long enough will eventually teach that life is about the content.
[12:56:45] <arryana> which is part of the class war going on at the moment as well.

[12:57:28] <arryana> i mean, my answer is relatively ridiculous, but a lot of fun.
[12:57:45] <arryana> everyone's answer will be different, but within a range.
[12:57:55] <inhahe_> contentment is okay, but it's not as good as happiness, joy or fulfillment. it borders on complacency.

[13:06:03] <inhahe_> first time I've ever had a VPN
[13:06:13] <arryana> he uses a vive, though, if i recall
[13:06:56] <arryana> there are any number of computers in his office, and i know one is a game machine.
[13:07:08] <arryana> couldn't say much about it, though, as it's endlessly in flux with new parts.
[13:07:47] <inhahe_> does that use a graphics card or does it have its own graphics card? (dunno much about vr)
[13:08:03] <arryana> i'll ask him to set up something similar in the zen room here next time he visits
[13:08:05] <arryana> i have no idea
[13:08:20] <arryana> i think it can work both ways, depending how it's set up

[13:10:16] <inhahe_> I like the idea of some games - like flight simulators, racing games and Mario games - but I rarely play them
[13:10:21] <inhahe_> despite having all this gaming stuff
[13:10:38] <arryana> i play with a ps2 and a dance mat
[13:10:45] <arryana> at least three times a week, often every day
[13:11:07] <inhahe_> in practice I think the game I like playing most is Smash Bros
[13:11:17] <arryana> but that's the only game i play, digitally.  occasionally we break out board games or card games here
[13:11:31] <arryana> and there's spatial games too
[13:11:45] <arryana> i'm too adhd for video games
[13:11:54] <arryana> after half an hour i'd rather chew my arm off

[13:24:02] <causative> we're all doomed when it comes to the climate
[13:24:26] <Inhahe> agree
[13:24:45] <Inhahe> and climate change is just one of many disastrous environmental issues
[13:24:54] <Inhahe> that pile up and get worse
[13:25:08] <causative> we could set of a bunch of nukes inside a volcano, cause nuclear winter
[13:25:38] <causative> only a temporary solution
[13:25:45] <I_Am_M00t> lol
[13:25:56] <I_Am_M00t> interesting suggestion
[13:27:03] <causative> massive geoengineering projects to take co2 out of the air probably won't get done
[13:27:04] <Inhahe> i'm sure the result would be too cold or too hot
[13:27:04] <Inhahe> and all that ash would snuff out a lot of life regardless
[13:27:44] <causative> the time for such projects is now and we aren't doing them
[13:28:16] <causative> in a few decades things will gradually get worse and we still won't do them
[13:29:03] <I_Am_M00t> social change is more effective
[13:29:04] <causative> but nukes in a volcano - that's not so expensive, any country with the capability could do it
[13:29:14] <I_Am_M00t> remote work for instance
[13:29:21] <I_Am_M00t> can be done immediately
[13:29:34] <causative> not gonna be enough
[13:29:53] <I_Am_M00t> there's a list of social behavior that can be changed
[13:30:09] <causative> won't be changed because it carries costs no one wants to pay
[13:30:17] <I_Am_M00t> maybe so
[13:30:41] <I_Am_M00t> but it is within the realm of possibility, and the effects are immediate
[13:31:07] <causative> if we had a nuclear war, not only would there be a nuclear winter, but industry would be set back drastically, reducing emissions
[13:31:30] <causative> that could save us from global warming for a longer period of time
[13:31:46] <DPA> I think there was a mass extinction after a massive vulcano outbreak once. If it's big enough to last for years, it'll probably create an ice age, and together with the darkness, that would keep stuff from growing, leading to missing food.
[13:31:46] <DPA> Most animals can't adapt to such changes quickly enough and die out.
[13:32:24] <causative> you have to gauge it DPA - just enough to cool stuff by a few degrees, not so much you cause too much extinction
[13:32:54] <causative> we can dial it in, we have the technology to predict what it's going to do
[13:33:10] <DPA> I think you'd need to regularely blow up a vulcano then, though. And there may not be enough volcanos for that.
[13:33:27] <causative> there's a lot of volcanoes
[13:34:13] <DPA> If you have to blow one up every month or so, you'd need 12 per year. And they'd have  to be decently sized.

[13:34:40] <causative> we may not actually need a volcano anyway, a nuke can make its own volcano
[13:35:09] <causative> there are probably thousands of volcanoes worldwide
[13:35:18] <inhahe_> and a few supervolcanoes
[13:35:48] <causative> and I don't think we'd need one per month
[13:36:04] <causative> one per year should suffice
[13:36:36] <causative> because the Earth is a very big system, it takes a lot of time for the ash to spread around the globe and cause cooling
[13:36:46] <causative> that takes longer than a month
[13:37:19] <causative> the only reason to set them off more frequently would be to cool the earth more "smoothly" in smaller steps
[13:37:44] <causative> but all we really want is a degree or two of cooling once a year, those are small enough steps

[13:42:34] <causative> nobody wants to take drastic action because it happens so slowly and isn't their responsibility alone
[13:42:44] <causative> and this state of affairs will continue
[13:43:11] <causative> we'll just adjust to the new normal until our farmland is desert
[13:43:29] <Inhahe> how could radiation cause a global temperature change while the fallout is only a local problem?
[13:43:51] <causative> radiation doesn't cause the temperature change, the volcanic ash ejected into the stratosphere causes the temperature change by blocking sunlight
[13:44:06] <DPA> I think there may be better ways to get rid of all the CO2. One important thing is restoring the whale population. More whales means more whale shit which causes more plankton. It's known to have a decently big impact on the carbon cycle.
[13:44:25] <Inhahe> oh ok, that was my first thought, but 'nuclear winter' seems to imply it's the radiation
[13:44:32] *** Quits: inhahe_ (inhahe@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/inhahe) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[13:44:52] <causative> actually "nuclear winter" normally refers to a change in temperature due to nukes starting massive fires, which send ash into the atmosphere to block sunlight
[13:45:05] <Inhahe> ahh
[13:45:06] <causative> however, this isn't good for global warming because it releases CO2
[13:45:45] <DPA> Then, someone needs to collect or burn all the methane that is being freed by the methane lakes which are melting now.
[13:46:05] <causative> DPA, whales are absolutely insignificant in terms of CO2 emissions globally
[13:46:17] <causative> you're many order of magnitude off the mark

[13:48:10] <ro-bot-o> [url] The Impact of Whaling on the Ocean Carbon Cycle: Why Bigger Was Better | journals.plos.org
[13:48:46] <Inhahe> It seems odd to me that the ocean's biomass would be significantly less than land's, because there's a lot more ocean and it's a lot deeper
[13:49:06] <causative> fewer nutrients
[13:49:08] <Inhahe>  not to mention it's where life originated
[13:49:23] <Inhahe> hm
[13:49:31] <causative> life is more about surface area than volume
[13:49:46] <causative> ultimately all life gets its energy from the sun, which has output measured in watts per m^2
[13:49:57] <Inhahe> tehre's more surface area of ocean
[13:50:33] <causative> well, that at least takes care of the idea that "the ocean is deeper"
[13:50:35] <DPA> A lot of carbon diffuses into the ocean. That's why its becomming more and more accidic.
[13:50:39] <causative> the depth doesn't matter so much
[13:50:43] <causative> surface area matters
[13:51:02] <causative> now, on land, this sunlight makes it right to the dirt, where there's lots of nutrients for growing plants
[13:51:14] <causative> but in the sea, the dirt is way down deep, in the dark
[13:51:24] <causative> so plants have more difficulty growing
[13:52:36] <causative> so even though the ocean does have more surface area, its suitability for life is much lower per unit of surface area
[13:53:19] <DPA> Whales poop near the surface, and plancton needs and thrives where they do.
[13:53:40] <causative> in terms of nutrients, whale poop can't compare to the dirt of the Amazon rainforest
[13:53:47] <causative> there's just not nearly enough of it

[13:56:22] <causative> to reverse global warming permanently what we need is to take CO2 *out* of the atmosphere
[13:56:33] <causative> and store it somewhere in huge quantities
[13:57:30] <DPA> It's not enough for there to be surface. There also needs to be carbon getting trapped there. Trees usually aren't all that effective at that.
[13:57:49] <causative> trees are great at trapping carbon
[13:58:03] <causative> life traps carbon in the form of biomass, most of which is on land, and most of that is in forests
[13:58:26] <causative> a big tree traps plenty of carbon, in its trunk branches roots and leaves
[13:58:35] <DPA> When biomass decomposes, it releases a lot of the CO2 again.
[13:59:00] <DPA> And trees grow slowly.
[13:59:00] <causative> that is true, but what matters in the end is the actual amount of carbon in the atmosphere and on the land
[13:59:16] <causative> big tree -> more carbon on land
[13:59:37] *** Joins: lakitu (~lakitu@192-198-3-9.dhcp.radiolinkinternet.com)
[14:00:38] <causative> in fact most of our fossil fuel comes from ancient plants that never fully decomposed
[14:00:48] <DPA> More CO2 in the atmosphere doesn't cause trees to use more of it. And additional carbon being trapped requires more biomass being generated. It's not enough for a tree to just stand there.
[14:01:02] <causative> yes, it is enough for a tree to just stand there
[14:01:08] <causative> the carbon has to stand somewhere
[14:01:25] <causative> the important thing is getting it to not stand in the air
[14:02:04] <DPA> No, it's not. The amount in the air increases, and if a tree just keeps standing there, the amount it binds is pretty much constant.
[14:02:13] <causative> so you need more trees
[14:02:54] <causative> the same is true for plankton, but plankton biomass is much smaller than tree biomass, even if you increased the amount of plankton it would still be very small compared to tree biomass
[14:03:19] <DPA> I think it'd need more Moorland, places where conditions are right to minimize the CO2 that gets back into the atmosphere.
[14:03:31] <causative> sure
[14:03:46] <causative> unfortunately, nature has not provided us too many swamps
[14:04:02] <causative> but if we could cut down massive numbers of trees and store them in airless underground caverns, that would help
[14:04:17] <causative> assuming we let new trees grow back and repeat the process
[14:04:25] <causative> we'd essentially be putting the oil back in the ground
[14:04:47] <causative> too expensive to ever be done, though
[14:05:10] <DPA> plankton is small, but there is a lot of it. Some is being eaten by fish. And a lot of the dead stuff sinks to the ocean floor, like the really deep ones. Down there, stuff doesn't decompose and get back up.

[14:06:11] <ro-bot-o> [url] Ocean Science: The power of plankton | Nature | www.nature.com
[14:06:19] <causative> "Biologists set out to estimate the total biomass of phytoplankton and calculated that less than one billion tonnes of the single-celled microorganisms were alive in the ocean at any one time"
[14:06:46] <causative> compared to 550 billion tons of global biomass, it's 0.2%
[14:09:02] <bittersweetsymph> https://news.mongabay.com/2021/03/to-fight-climate-change-save-the-whales-some-scientists-say/
[14:09:02] <ro-bot-o> [url] To fight climate change, save the whales, some scientists say | news.mongabay.com
[14:09:33] <causative> also a quick calculation shows the carbon in the atmosphere is about half of the carbon biomass on Earth
[14:10:46] <DPA> It also says: There were 45 billion tonnes of new phytoplankton each year, 45 times more than their own mass at any given time. The phytoplankton would therefore have had to reproduce themselves entirely, on average, 45 times a year, or roughly once a week
[14:10:59] <causative> it doesn't matter how fast they reproduce
[14:11:04] <causative> it matters how much carbon they store
[14:11:26] <DPA> It does. A lot more new material, which sinks down, and actually stays there.
[14:11:35] <causative> citation needed that it "stays there"
[14:12:47] <DPA> Same article: In the dark, cold waters below, scavengers and microorganisms would break down all this organic matter into its chemical constituents. Because those cold, deep waters rarely mix with the warm upper waters floating above, carbon dioxide and other simple nutrients would be stored in the deep ocean.
[14:13:42] <causative> well, then maybe
[14:15:54] <causative> plankton hasn't been keeping up with our CO2 emissions so far
[14:16:20] <causative> if there is a significant effect of plankton taking in carbon then falling to the ocean floor where it stays forever - the rate of this happening can't be too great
[14:17:06] <causative> I don't know how large this effect is and so far we have not seen a figure that tries to estimate it
[14:17:43] <causative> it's not the 45 Gt figure, most of that doesn't fall all the way down
[14:19:25] <DPA> I wonder if it would be possible to engineer plancton to not only stere CO2, but also safely decompose plastic at the same time. If that was possible, the plastic problem could be solved, and the CO2 problem may get a bit less worse at the same time.
[14:19:38] <DPA> *store
[14:25:38] <I_Am_M00t> there's another thing you can do to mitigate the plastic problem, dont dump it in the ocean, stop using single use

[18:10:00] <tomathy> i agree with the latter metaphorically
[18:10:06] <tomathy> judgement must incur punishment
[18:10:24] <Inhahe>  fighting with fists is brutish and pointless and there's nothing more moral about it because the strongest man/best fighter probably isn't correlated with being the person in the right/the person it would be just for them to win. but guns aren't any better, how standoffish do you have to be to own a machine whose sole purpose is to kill fellow humans. and fighting would at least spare

[18:20:07] <varde> Trying to elevate my philosophical understanding of the situation.
[18:20:41] <varde> I feel my mind is clouded by incorrectness but apparently that's my eye of perfection again.
[18:20:53] <Inhahe> letting people have guns drastically increases the number of people who get killed for no reason
[18:21:18] <varde> I simply imply a more strategic policeman.
[18:21:54] <Inhahe> imo, police shouldn't have guns.
[18:22:06] <Inhahe> but i live in the us where the police are murderous bullies
[18:22:19] <Inhahe> most police don't have guns in England and that works out, I hear

[18:25:36] <tomathy> althought i didnt find it frightening
[18:25:41] <pussipupu> And they aren't necessarily shy of just battering people

[18:26:18] <Inhahe>  i'd rather be battered than dead
[18:27:05] <pussipupu> The two aren't mutually exclusive
[18:27:14] <varde> Still, safety is too paramount when security(something different) is what should be. War is simple, it's the Armory that is complex. Metaphorically saying we can handle our safety if our society is secured.
[18:27:32] <pussipupu> Though I'm broadly in favour of limiting police armaments (and properly holding them to account for violence and other abuses)
[18:28:00] <Inhahe> maybe most of the time?
[18:31:13] <tomathy> fk da polees
[18:32:14] <pussipupu> Huh, I'm surprised to see (according to a random Wikipedia article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_killings_by_law_enforcement_officers_by_country) that Finnish police have a higher killing people rate than British ones

[18:32:40] <pussipupu> Though still an order of magnitude lower than US
[18:36:02] <pussipupu> Access to firearms clearly increases the ability to do violence including fatal violence, but it's neither necessary nor sufficient to cause violence

[20:47:19] <varde> Wouldn't it be great to feel euphoric, right now - hence, heroin. However, side effects are there.
[20:47:57] <varde> I reckon they're a major part of existential, societal growth...
[20:49:14] <varde> I mean we've all dabbled. We're all experts here. Let's talk.
[20:50:18] <apotheon> I've never even smoked pot.
[20:50:38] <apotheon> I've had prescription opiates and alcohol.
[20:50:46] <varde> Methadone?
[20:50:49] <apotheon> well . . . opioids
[20:50:52] <varde> Well, they're like alcohol.
[20:52:43] <varde> In short, if alcohol is good to you then would it be rude to shorthand it and say it's bad - not giving it a good word
[20:53:07] <apotheon> I gave up alcohol completely.
[20:53:33] <apotheon> I turned down opioids the last two times a doctor offered a prescription.
[20:53:44] <apotheon> maybe more than two, but at least two for sure
[20:54:36] <apotheon> I don't know that I'd say these things are "good" per se.  There are cases where they may be better than not having them, for whatever reason.  I don't believe they should be illegal.
[20:54:46] <apotheon> . . . but I don't want them.
[20:55:23] <apotheon> I'm not any more inclined to say that people *should* use them than I am to say they should be *prohibited* from using them.
[20:55:43] <apotheon> It's your choice.  Just do it responsibly, please.
[20:56:33] <varde> Good say
[20:58:35] <apotheon> I like caffeine, sometimes, but not for a buzz.  In fact, I try to make sure I get some L-theanine with the caffeine, to dampen the overtly discernible effects.
[20:59:07] <varde> I love the taste
[20:59:18] <varde> Ground coffee, nes-cafe
[20:59:37] <varde> nes-cafe is a beautiful company name
[21:00:01] <varde> Like, sold cafe or cafe in the shops
[21:00:23] <apotheon> I'm not much of a fan of the flavor of coffee per se, but I do like some flavored lattes.
[21:00:49] <apotheon> café latte, if you're not using the common US abbreviation of the term
[21:01:04] <varde> Try ground coffe
[21:01:08] <apotheon> err

[21:01:19] <varde> Darker, less strong
[21:01:20] <apotheon> missed an "f"
[21:01:34] <apotheon> varde: I've had it.  I don't like the flavor of coffee.
[21:02:25] <apotheon> I've had percolated, drip-brewed, pour-over, and instant coffee -- probably other variants, too.
[21:03:12] <varde> I need to try more
[21:03:14] <apotheon> Sometimes, I like coffee flavor as an accent added to something else, such as "Ranger pudding" -- basically some instant coffee, some instant hot chocolate powder, and enough water to give it kind of a muddy texture.
[21:03:33] <apotheon> . . . or a flavored latte.
[21:03:56] <apotheon> The missus doesn't like coffee flavor at all.
[21:04:10] <apotheon> I don't even like black tea.
[21:04:19] <apotheon> . . . but I *really* like Gyokuro tea.

[21:26:13] <apotheon> Commes?  Do you mean the commune?
[21:26:20] <apotheon> in France, I think
[21:26:43] <apotheon> yep, Normandy
[21:29:10] <tomathy> what manner speaketh thou of my origin as from dirt or clay - for i seek to origin where thee seeketh to be
[21:29:29] <apotheon> "origin" isn't a verb
[21:29:40] <apotheon> also, try "thou seekest"
[21:30:05] <pussipupu> No, that fits with “origin” as a noun to be fair
[21:30:09] <apotheon> mighta wanted to start that sentence with "in"
[21:30:14] <pussipupu> Oh, missed the second one, that's wrong indeed
[21:30:15] <tomathy> folly, as if verbiage an art to itself. merely a means, which thee hast forbid we reach
[21:30:20] <apotheon> pussipupu: yep
[21:30:21] <pussipupu> Also “in what manner”
[21:30:30] <apotheon> second "origin", second "seeketh"
[21:30:46] <apotheon> pussipupu: That's why I mentinoed starting with "in".
[21:30:52] <apotheon> "by" could work, too
[21:30:55] <pussipupu> “where thou seekest”  is right yes
[21:31:14] <pussipupu> Sorry, listening to an interesting podcast at the same time as IRC runs my parsers in the red
[21:31:33] <pussipupu> Especially when trying to untangle fractally dodgy grammar :þ

[21:32:11] <apotheon> "By what manner speaketh thou of my origin as from dirt or clay -- for I seek to originate where thou seeketh to be."  I don't know if "originate" changes the intended meaning of the sentence, because I'm not sure what the sentence was supposed to mean.

[21:34:32] <pussipupu> If we're doing EME then second person singular verbs should take -st
[21:34:46] <tomathy> i speak from my soul, good sir -which needeth not correction, only mercy, and not i hope from thee
[21:35:16] <pussipupu> Or possibly I'm thinking more late-middle, but -eth is still third person :þ
[21:36:09] <tomathy> my thanks to thou and thy kindred

[21:36:35] <pussipupu> thou is the subject case

[21:37:07] <apotheon> Oh, did I forget to -est?
[21:37:08] <apotheon> shit
[21:37:18] <apotheon> I even called that out earlier.
[21:37:24] <tomathy> typest?
[21:37:35] <tomathy> thankest
[21:37:37] <apotheon> I typeth for thee.
[21:37:45] <pussipupu> It's easy with this kind of realtime error checking to pick up patterns from the source
[21:37:50] <apotheon> yep
[21:38:13] <apotheon> I was too focused on "origin" . . . and distracted myself.
[21:38:15] <pussipupu> We're pattern matching monkeys after all, and learners of langauge
