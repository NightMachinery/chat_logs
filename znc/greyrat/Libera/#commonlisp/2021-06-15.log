[00:19:37] <hexology> local-time is great, thanks all for the recommendation
[00:19:58] <hexology> is there an equally agreed-upon library for building unix-style command line applications?
[00:21:00] <hexology> adopt seems familiar coming from languages like python, unix-options looks clever
[00:21:16] <pjb> hexology: there are half a dozen command line argument parsing librariesâ€¦
[00:21:26] <pjb> Some with the same name even.
[00:21:49] <hexology> i saw the list on cliki. i should rephrase: "which one do you prefer?"
[00:21:58] <pjb> I use my own. :-)
[00:22:36] <pjb> I started lisping before they wrote those libraries.
[00:25:47] <hexology> do you have a recommendation for a good "default" for new projects?
[00:27:09] <kevingal> This one looks gud: https://github.com/libre-man/unix-opts
[00:27:29] <kevingal> I bookmarked it in case I ever needed a CLI parser, anyway.
[00:27:58] <Xach> hexology: to date i usually roll my own, which i find a little faster than understanding a library one. i mostly just pop things off the command line list and check against known strings like "--help" and such. i know a library can make it easier if you do it a lot or want to be more declarative.

[06:12:29] <ludston> beach: I like your "reverse-order" paper. It's using recursion in an interesting way. I am thinking this approach might have trouble though for O(n^2) algorithms. e.g. "(reduce (lambda (x y) (+ x y (reduce '+ some-large-list :from-end t))) some-large-list :from-end t)" as once the remaining stack space is small, nthcdr could be called a very large
[06:12:29] <ludston> number of times.
[06:14:13] *** Quits: dlowe (~dlowe@user/dlowe) (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:16:28] <ludston> This seems like a solvable problem except for in cases where you don't know the number of times that reduce will be recursively invoked.

[06:20:24] <ludston> My example of an O(n^2) algorithm is contrived, but yes there are algorithms where O(n^2) is optimal. Algorithms like O(n^m) are pretty rare though, given the run-time tends to become infinite when you have more than 10 elements.

[17:58:41] <gendl> Morning, is this channel so quiet today?
[17:59:04] <beach> It has been pretty quiet lately.
[18:03:43] <pjb> It' strange that compiler-macro-function takes an environment parameter, but it can only be NIL for (setf compiler-macro-function).
[18:03:52] <pjb> Ie compiler-macro-functions only for global functions.
[18:05:08] <jackdaniel> this silence is a sound hacking; it will blossom in a week or two ,)
[18:05:36] <phoe> pjb: I don't know if having a local compiler macro function is a wanted feature
[18:07:22] *** Joins: knusbaum (~kjn@2601:240:8480:9990:d01f:121a:ec38:ad)
[18:08:06] <Bike> compiler-macro-function needs it because compiler macros can be shadowed by local functions
[18:08:22] <Bike> but also, typep and subtypep and find-class take environment parameters, and there's no concept of local types

[18:09:44] <beach> Can those just be different global environments, like the ones mentioned for file compilation?
[18:09:59] *** Joins: knusbaum (~kjn@2601:240:8480:9990:d01f:121a:ec38:ad)
[18:11:05] <beach> I guess that depends on how DEFTYPE behaves at compile time.  
[18:11:11] * beach checks...
[18:12:12] <Bike> also, local compiler macros could be kind of nice for things like call-next-method
[18:12:17] <Bike> not common, but nice
[18:12:37] <jackdaniel> unl - uncommon nice lisp
[18:13:47] <beach> So it looks like DEFTYPE can be defined in the compilation environment, so the environment to TYPEP and SUBTYPEP could be a compilation environment.
[18:13:58] <beach> FIND-CLASS is more mysterious. 
[18:15:15] <jackdaniel> could it be that find-class when used with compilation environment yields a forward referenced class instance standing for a class that is defined in this compilation unit?
[18:15:48] <beach> I thought of that possibility, but I don't remember seeing anything like that.
[18:16:16] <Bike> iirc ccl does that
[18:16:23] <Bike> though not a forward-referenced-class
[18:16:37] <Bike> the defclass clhs entry has that confusing bit about compiler side effects
[18:16:52] <beach> Yes, I am reading it now.
[18:19:45] <beach> I have no idea what it means. 
[18:20:12] <beach> Oh, wait, there is an Issue about that.
[18:22:30] <beach> No help there.
[18:22:49] <pjb> Bike: oh I see, so with a lexical environment compiler-macro-function could return NIL because its (global) function is shadowed.
[18:23:28] <pjb> The magic of a specification: if you use it to implement something, it works even if you don't understand it! :-)
[18:23:46] <pjb> beach: ^ I wonder if that advantage is recorded somewhere.
[18:27:47] <beach> Heh, good question.
[18:28:20] <beach> What if DEFCLASS is in an (EVAL-WHEN (:COMPILE-TOPLEVEL) ...)?
[18:28:31] <beach> Then the class would be defined in the evaluation environment.
[18:28:56] <Bike> we used to do that in clasp but it causes some practical issues, especially with mop
[18:29:20] <beach> It would be strange either way, because it would be a different class at run time.
[18:29:58] <beach> Well, maybe not.  I can imagine classes that are useful only at compile time.
[18:31:36] <beach> So does that mean that DEFCLASS always defines the class in the evaluation environment? 
[18:31:36] <jackdaniel> fwiw mcclim does a funny thing: it records presentations at compile time and tries to attach them to functions at run time (because as you have noted it may be a different class by then :)
[18:31:53] <jackdaniel> s/them to functions/them to classes/
[18:32:07] <beach> Hmm.
[18:33:11] <beach> That would seem consistent with the description of DEFCLASS.
[18:33:30] <Bike> what clasp does now is note any accessors in a similar way to what it does for defuns, and then sets an internal "class-info" in the environment, which covers the stuff where later sub/typep calls need to recognize it as a type, etc
[18:33:38] <Bike> i forget how find-class works at compile time
[18:34:07] <beach> Well, the Common Lisp HyperSpec kind of says how.
[18:35:14] <beach> An environment parameter of a macro is always going to be the compilation environment, and the compilation environment inherits from the evaluation environment.
[18:35:22] *** Joins: Alfr (~Alfr@user/alfr)
[18:35:35] <beach> So if the class is defined in the evaluation environment, that makes the phrase in the Common Lisp HyperSpec make sense.
[18:35:48] <Bike> i meant the case in which the class is not defined in the evaluation environment
[18:36:14] <beach> But my hypothesis is that the wording of the Common Lisp HyperSpec means that it always is.
[18:36:54] <Bike> meaning every defclass form is evaluated at compile time?
[18:37:05] <beach> Yes, but only in the evaluation environment.
[18:37:32] <Bike> evaluating defclass forms at compile time at all can cause issues. people do things like put a defclass form and a related validate-superclass method definition in the same file.
[18:37:48] <Bike> or methods for defining slot definition classes, etc
[18:38:18] <beach> I am not saying it is a good idea.  I am just speculating about the meaning of the wording in the Common Lisp HyperSpec. 
[18:39:54] <beach> It could be a forward-referenced-class as jackdaniel suggests.  Nothing is said about the utility of the class at compile time.  Just that FIND-CLASS must return it.
[18:39:55] <Bike> https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp/issues/926 e.g. here's an issue we hit with clim
[18:39:56] <jackdaniel> wouldn't evaluating (%compiler-defclass-using-internals-but-preserving-identity â€¦) in the compilation environment suffice?
[18:40:04] *** Quits: aeth (~Michael@user/aeth) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[18:40:27] <jackdaniel> (given that find-class knows how to access it of course)
[18:40:30] <pjb> beach: even if the macro form is EVALuated?
[18:40:38] <pjb> (eval '(defclass foo ()  ()))
[18:41:24] <jackdaniel> Bike: that is related to the funny thing I've mentioned above
[18:41:26] <beach> pjb: That's different.  It mentions only a call to FIND-CLASS.
[18:41:45] *** Joins: aeth (~Michael@user/aeth)
[18:42:17] <beach> pjb: EVAL always acts in the startup environment.
[18:43:18] <beach> jackdaniel: I don't know what that means. 
[18:44:51] <jackdaniel> beach: that there is no need to evaluate defclass at all, it is enough for the compiler to take a note and return something sensible from find-class
[18:45:33] <jackdaniel> (i.e if find-class is not called, then not define a class at all; and if it is called with the compiler environment make an instance of a forward-referenced class)
[18:46:28] <jackdaniel> s/at all/at compile time/
[18:46:50] <Bike> i think the main thing is i don't understand what you're supposed to be able to do with a find-class result, if anything
[18:47:05] <Bike> can you even do subtypep and stuff with it? couldn't the set of superclasses be affected by mop methods?

[19:06:50] <beach> Bike: Yes, exactly.  There is no explanation. 
[19:07:59] <jackdaniel> couldn't determining whether NAME denotes a class influence a macro expansion?
[19:08:22] <beach> That's an interesting idea.
[19:10:36] <jackdaniel> i.e (if (find-class 'foo nil cmp-env) `(fast-something ,obj) `(slow-something (make-wrapper ,obj)))
[19:10:49] <jackdaniel> s/make-wrapper/maybe-make-wrapper/
[19:11:25] <beach> Yeah.  There couldn't be much more to do at compile time.
[19:12:09] <beach> And in that case, just associating the name with a new forward-referenced-class in the evaluation environment will work.

[22:15:03] <jcowan> I'm wondering why nobody has implemented a CL in which COMPILE-FILE is done by compiling to C.  It's been done several times for Scheme, and Scheme's control structure is much more un-C-ish than CL's.

[22:27:15] <jcowan> I didn't know about molybdenum chloride.  Forgetting the KCL family (KCL/AKCL/GCL/ECL) was a brain fart.  I can't find anything named CLOCC except a code library
[22:28:39] <MichaelRaskin> Maybe CLiCC, actually
[22:29:55] <pjb> Oh, yes, I meant cliccâ€¦.
[22:29:58] <loke> What we really need is a CL what compiles to COBOL.
[22:30:53] <loke> I've actually been playing around with COBOL lately. It's an interesting thing.
[22:31:02] <pjb> lokeIn the meantime, you can use opencobol on linux and link with libecl.

[23:19:23] <etimmons> gigamonkey: Pretty much. ASDF wants that naming scheme so that it can map system names to an .asd file.
[23:19:46] <jackdaniel> gigamonkey: there is a deeper reasoning behind that -- say that asdf doesn't know anything about the system - then when you type (asdf:load-system "flexi-streams.foo") it will look for the file flexi-streams.foo.asd
[23:20:00] <jackdaniel> while flexi-streams/foo is not ambigous with this regard
[23:20:04] <etimmons> Most projects have adapted, but some steadfastly refuse. I think flexi-streams is in the latter camp.
[23:20:32] <jackdaniel> that said, when you have flexi-streams.test that is loaded only after flexi-streams, then asdf knows where the system is defined, because it already has loaded flexi-streams.asd
[23:20:44] <jackdaniel> but it is not that this warning is without a reason
