[00:09:41] <snake> why is it that in "precalc" or general math you could say.. we are told that a function must be "one to one" to have an inverse. but in discrete math, we're told it must also be a bijection (and we're told that all functions are one-to-one)
[00:10:03] <snake> discrete math being like math for computer science
[00:12:33] <snake> or am i just getting mixed up entirely
[00:12:38] <snake> probably more likely i suppose
[00:14:46] <snake> yeah i have it written from my discrete math class "function: x-> y is one-to-one (aka injective) if for every y there exists at most one x

[00:26:32] <Galois> an injection (aka a 1-1 function, without the word "correspondence") has a left inverse

[04:33:34] <greenbagels> but if you take whats called an affine subspace, this is like a vector subspace shifted by a constant vector
[04:33:54] <greenbagels> your affine functions would be similar to that; lines of the form y=mx+b for possibly nonzero b
[04:35:31] <vin> I see, why would one want a afine version of a linear function? Or the need of afine subspace?
[04:35:50] <greenbagels> well they represent situations where the sum of two elements may not be in the same space
[04:35:52] <rapha> greenbagels: i want to know how much longer or shorter each airplane's cowl is as compared to the rest of its fuselage. but they
[04:35:57] <rapha> 're all different sizes.
[04:36:25] <greenbagels> right so the ratio will tell you what fraction of one length the other one is
[04:36:30] *** Joins: trace987 (~trace@user/trace)
[04:36:55] <greenbagels> so like for 16:94, 94/16 is about 5.9, so 94 is 5.9 times larger than 16
[04:37:10] <rapha> hmm
[04:37:17] <rapha> and for the big one it's 6.5
[04:37:27] *** Quits: trace987 (~trace@user/trace) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:37:31] <rapha> so the three small ones are quite close to one another
[04:37:40] <rapha> but the big one has ... too long of a cowl, right?
[04:37:42] <greenbagels> vin: so like the most contrived example would just be solutions to an equation like ax = b
[04:38:08] <rapha> man this has me confused
[04:38:14] <greenbagels> all these solutions can be written as the set of solutions to ax=0 (the linear subspace) combined with a single solution to ax=b
[04:38:21] <greenbagels> combine those two, and you generate the entire affine subspace
[04:39:16] <rapha> you wrote "94 is 5.9 times larger than 16" ... and so, 780 is 6.5 times larger than 120 ... so the bigger airplane's cowl is too *short* as compared to the other three?
[04:39:51] <greenbagels> i dont know enough to make any claims about too big or too small

[04:41:05] <rapha> greenbagels: the 780:120 pair of numbers is the one i'm building. the other 3 pairs are taken by printing out drawings of the real thing and measuring from the paper.
[04:41:41] <vin> greenbagels: I am assuming a subspace is also a hyperplane of the function, so when I do an operation that is allowed in the subscpace of a linear function (ax=0), say addition, now this can't be represented in the old hyperplane, so this will now be in the afine hyperplane which is represented by ax = b correct?
[04:41:43] *** Joins: Visne (~Visne@dhcp-077-248-174-092.chello.nl)
[04:41:46] <rapha> like i said there's many versions of the thing so 5.8 vs 5.3 vs 5.5 is expected.
[04:42:04] <rapha> but 6.5 is a bit far off.
[04:42:32] <rapha> the number 780 is fixed. so i need to find out what i should make the number be that is currently 120.
[04:42:43] <vin> sorry my bad, a subspace is a subset of a hyperplane, not the same1
[04:42:46] <rapha> oh waaait ... maybe i could just divide 780 by one of the other numbers!
[04:42:53] <greenbagels> well you could set up an equation

[04:43:27] <greenbagels> in other words 780 / x = 5.5; and now you solve for x
[04:43:43] <rapha> hah!
[04:43:49] <greenbagels> vin: well you can assume for this purpose that they're all subsets of the same ambient space
[04:44:32] <greenbagels> in algebraic terms, say x1 and x2 are solutions to ax=0; then a(x1+x2) = ax1 + ax2 = 0 + 0 = 0
[04:44:35] <greenbagels> so their sum is also a solution
[04:44:37] <vin> right hyperplanes can also be a subspace, intersection of 3d hyperplanes.
[04:45:06] <rapha> i did this: (5,875+5,36842105263157894737+5,5217391304347826087)/3 ... which gives 5,58838672768878718536 ... and then i did what you told me, 780 / 5,58838672768878718536 ... which gives 139,57516507140297896286 ... so i should design the 3d printed part to be 140mm long. thank you greenbagels!!!
[04:45:09] <greenbagels> but if you say x1 and x2 are solutions to ax=b, then a(x1+x2) = ax1 + ax2 = b+b = 2b, so the sum of solutions to ax=b (let's call these "particular" solutions) is not a solution

[04:45:34] *** Quits: zacts (~zacts@user/zacts) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[04:46:25] <greenbagels> vin: but this means if x0 is a solution to ax=0, and x1 is a solution to ax=b, then a(x0+x1) = ax0+ax1 = 0 + b = b is indeed a solution to ax=b still

[06:04:00] <vin> "A set C is convex if the line segment between any two points in C lies in C, i.e., if for any x1 x2 ∈ C and any a with 0 ≤ a ≤ 1, we have ax1 + (1-a)x2 ∈ C" why is this set called "convex" what represents the cup like curve?
[06:04:16] <JordiGH> Convex functions hold water.
[06:04:53] <dwigton_> unlike my opinions.
[06:06:59] <Fangs> vin: from the 'outside' if you just look at a portion of the convex shape, it (might) look like a convex lens
[06:07:08] <vin> So the elements of set C are values of a convex function? the function itself when plotted forms a cup like region
[06:07:13] <Fangs> the typical convex shape is a disc I would shape

[06:32:16] <Fangs> the solid disc looks like (x,y,z) : x^2 + y^2 + z^2 <= 1. a function f(x,y,z) can only describe one point, so you'd need at least two functions
[06:33:08] <greenbagels> a vector valued function, sure
[06:33:13] <Fangs> so f(x,y,z) = sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2) will describe the top half of a disc, while g(x,y,z)=-sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2) describes the bottom half
[06:33:50] <vin> Fangs: but a sphere can be represented with just one equation right? So you are saying not all polyhedrons can be represented by a single equation eh

[09:16:18] <isekaijin> Don't you have to use the Galois-invariance of the trace somewhere?
[09:18:43] <isekaijin> Anyhow, if you have finite field extensions E/F and F/K, then elements of E can be written as matrices with entries in F, and elements of F can be written as matrices with entries in K, so elements of E can be written as block matrices with entries in K.
[09:19:05] <isekaijin> On the other hand, ignoring F, we can write E/K directly as matrices with entries in K.
[09:19:15] <isekaijin> Errr, I'm assuming everything separable, of course.
[09:19:32] <isekaijin> Anyhow, we have two distinct representations of elements of E as matrices with entries in K.
[09:19:54] <Fangs> this is fine if you work abstractly with these extensions and trace/det of an extension
[09:20:07] <isekaijin> Mmm.

[09:46:57] <Fangs> isekaijin: you take the sum of all possible 'a's

[09:51:14] <isekaijin> Errr, no
[09:51:26] <isekaijin> All the inclusions have the same image.
[09:51:30] <isekaijin> But there might be different inclusions.
[09:51:36] <Fangs> I mean that makes some sense. so Q(b) -> C in general might not be unique, but the 'closue' might just be the smallest field contaning all these embeddings
[09:51:42] <isekaijin> But knowing that all the inclusions have the same image is still useful.

[09:55:15] <isekaijin> Okay, so, if E is the normal closure of b, then we can define an equivalence relation on Gal(E/Q), namely, g1 ~ g2 if and only if g1(a) = g2(a). And it turns out that the equivalence classes are the cosets of a subgroup of E.
[09:56:02] <isekaijin> So then we have to use orbit-stabilizer, I guess?
[09:56:14] <isekaijin> Errr, E is the normal closure of Q(b).

[10:30:03] <Fangs> apparently from the above expression you can conclude the norm/trace of a ring of integers of a number field is integral
[10:30:20] <Fangs> I don't quite see it

[10:42:08] <Galois> norm (for example) of z is the product of all the Galois conjugates of z
[10:42:20] <Galois> if z is an algebraic integer then all its conjugates are trivially also algebraic integers
[10:42:33] <Galois> the product of algebraic integers is an algebraic integer
[10:42:54] <Galois> so the norm is rational and an algebraic integer; the intersection of the set of rationals and the set of algebraic integers is the set of integers
[10:42:58] <Galois> so the norm is an integer
[10:43:06] <Fangs> ah thanks
[10:43:07] <Galois> same thing for trace, replacing product with sum
[10:43:40] <Fangs> I didnt think that it'd be an algebraic integer, but its clear now
[10:45:03] <Fangs> oh here's another corollary that might interest isekaijin the ring of integers of number fields have Krull dimension 1
[10:45:38] <Galois> or in other words algebraic number theory is just a special case of algebraic curves

[10:46:37] <Fangs> the only prime ideals are.. primes

[10:48:54] <Fangs> I was only thinking of non-zero ideals
[10:49:27] <Fangs> Galois: so in many ways these rings of integers of number fields are 'very much' like Z c Q
[10:49:35] <Galois> in scheme-land you can't ignore the 0 ideal
[10:49:37] <Fangs> thats a bit surprising
[10:49:56] <Fangs> idk about scheme, but for sheaves, naively the 0 ideal gives the entire surface
[10:50:05] <Fangs> err entire space
[10:50:45] <Galois> the more complicated number fields are just branched coverings of Z
[10:51:01] <Galois> dimension is still 1, but the branchings can get very intricate
[10:51:16] <Fangs> I dont have intuition for branch coverings, really
[10:51:31] <Fangs> I dropped that riemman surface course. you talk about those I think
[10:52:03] <Fangs> Galois: what does 'intricate' implies here

[10:52:23] <Galois> in number fields you can get wild ramification which isn't really a thing in complex geometry
[10:52:37] <Fangs> I would guess the branch covering you see in riemman surfaces are 'tame' somehow?
[10:52:37] <Galois> also Galois groups are just fundamental groups, and an algebraic closure is like a universal cover
[10:54:14] <Fangs> Galois: the only examples I know are basically locally like z^2, which is a ramified covering C. in this case C\{0} is genuinely a covering of C\{0}
[10:54:24] <Fangs> wild here meaning you can't do that?
[10:54:29] <Galois> I think wild ramification is probably closest in spirit to something like inseparable extensions in algebraic geometry
[10:54:54] <Fangs> like.. the 'group' of "C\{0}" is not a group or something like that?
[10:55:11] <Galois> if you do z^2 over R instead of over C then it starts to look more like a number field
[10:55:56] <Fangs> oh some points are just flat out not covered..
[10:56:06] <Galois> like, at x=1, setting z^2 = x, you get z^2 = 1, or z = ±1, this is a split prime in number theory
[10:56:17] <Galois> at x=0 you get your branched, or ramified, prime
[10:56:23] <Galois> at x=-1 it's not covered, so you get an inert prime
[10:57:42] <Galois> it's not a perfect analogy, because the residue fields aren't as varied as in the number field case
[10:57:43] *** Joins: mncheck (~mncheck@193.224.205.254)
[10:58:00] <Fangs> I still have to learn what those words mean. been slacking off my num thy course
[10:58:22] <Galois> like already with Z we have Z/p as the residue field at p, there's infinitely many different such residue fields, and that's just with one number field, namely Z
[10:58:33] <Galois> but with z^2 over R the only possible residue fields are R and C
[10:59:21] <Galois> did you realize that when you evaluate a polynomial f(x) at x=a, you're simply computing f(x) mod (x-a)
[10:59:43] <Fangs> sure yeah
[11:00:01] <Galois> and x-a is an irreducible polynomial, so polynomial evaluation is just taking the image or projection in a residue field
[11:00:24] <Galois> now you can say the same thing in integers. The analogue of "polynomial" is "integer"
[11:00:32] <Galois> and the analogue of "irreducible" is "prime"
[11:01:02] <Galois> so the "evaluation" of the "polynomial" f=18 at the "point" a=5 is 18 mod 5 = 3
[11:02:01] <Galois> immediately a small difficulty appears: the codomain of the map f ↦ f mod p differs, depending on what p is
[11:02:35] <Galois> this is not true in polynomial evaluation, where the codomain of f ↦  f mod (x-a) is always R, or C, or whatever your coefficient field is
[11:03:10] <Galois> although there's something interesting to say for polynomials: if I evaluate a real polynomial f(x) at the "irreducible" x^2+1, then I get effectively f(i)
[11:04:07] <Fangs> Galois: that small difficulty is a bit like fiber bundles/tangent bundles no? where the fibers looks the same but not "actually" the same
[11:04:30] <Galois> right. For R and C it's easy enough to handle without machinery, since R is a subset of C, so you can just say everything's in C
[11:04:45] <Galois> but the Z/p's aren't subsets of each other, so you need machinery
[11:05:28] <Fangs> I thought the analogue of evaluation is when you take a ring and you localize it at some prime ideal
[11:05:36] <Fangs> quotients are a bit different
[11:06:02] <Fangs> but your example makes sense for "x = a" <-> (x-a)

[11:08:15] <Fangs> Galois: this is so fascinating, I cant imagine being a number theorist and having some sort of geometric intuitition for these
[11:09:29] <Galois> localization is something different. Localization is like going from the integers to the rationals.
[11:09:42] <Galois> or, for polynomials, you're going from polynomials to rational functions
[11:10:20] <Galois> and if you localize at a point you're taking the polynomials which are nonvanishing (hence invertible) at that point

[11:11:28] <Fangs> elements of the quotients are functions on some subspace. so I guess if the quotient ring is 0-dimensional then its like evaluating at a point
[11:11:38] <Galois> localization gives you tangent spaces -- the algebraic definition of a tangent space is M_p/M_p^2, where M_p is the (unique) maximal ideal of the localization at p
[11:12:11] <Fangs> ah ok, so quotients modulo maximal ideals are evaluation

[15:59:42] <cadmio> I'd like to understand what's the text is trying to comunicate

[20:20:58] <tusko> sometimes when you see a sine wave its actually rotating in the complex plane, but because we see it from the side it just looks like a reggo sine wave
[20:23:36] <CarloWood> (a + 1)(a + 2) = a^2 + (1 + 2)a + 2 = a^2 + 1 + 1 = 1

[20:38:10] <CarloWood> I suppose -1 exists, because I see that as the special notation for "that what added to '1' gives 0". And both 1 and 0 exist... But it is confusing to use it, because '-1' and '2' are the same thing. So, why write -1 when you can use the symbol 2?
[20:40:06] <CarloWood> In finite fields subtraction and "negative" numbers (using the minus sign) are completely unnecessary; and so is using '/' (division).

[20:42:52] <Z-module> that's only fields of characteristic 2 (so, fields of order 2 or 4 or 8 or 16 or ....)
[20:43:21] <Z-module> in F_3, or any odd-order field, -x and x are always distinct if x isn't 0
[20:44:01] <Z-module> oh, I see, you were talking about a different point
[20:44:45] <Z-module> yeah, the inverse of something in a finite group is always a power of that thing
[20:44:51] <CarloWood> I mean... when ppl only had N, they invented the notation -x  (the minus written against the x, where x is a literal positive integer; ie  -3) to mean "that was you need to add to 3 to get 0".
[20:45:11] <Z-module> referring to the finite additive group of a field, or the finite multiplicative group of its nonzero elements
[20:45:27] <CarloWood> But that notation is not necessary for any finite field imho. It might be handy at times (?), but not necessary.
[20:46:02] <Z-module> It's useful when the thing being subtracted is general, variable, instead of some specific element
[20:46:22] <Z-module> useful to use - or / , I meant
[20:46:34] <CarloWood> subtraction is also just a notation I think.  x - y is just short for x + -y
[20:47:19] <CarloWood> Same -   1/x  is a *notation* meaning "that was you have to multiply x with to get 1".  Then y/x is short for y * 1/x.
