[21:28:48] <Activ8> anyone watching the apple conference right now?
[21:54:22] <Activ8> New iphone SE3, New iPad Air
[21:54:35] <Activ8> M1 chip coming to iPad Air
[21:54:41] <Activ8> both with 5G connectivity
[22:16:16] <scottpedia> got disappointed at apple long ago Activ8 
[22:16:29] <Activ8> awwww
[22:16:40] <Activ8> it's just the cost for a lot of people
[22:16:47] <Activ8> if they had the money they would get them all
[22:16:53] <scottpedia> apple's technologies are as always great
[22:17:13] <scottpedia> i've been a quite devoted fan since I was 7
[22:17:39] <scottpedia> it's just that over time you see the true nature of such companies
[22:18:12] <scottpedia> they just want the money
[22:18:33] <scottpedia> a lot of the corporate sales strategies apple use are nasty
[22:18:46] <scottpedia> also it hires child labor in china
[22:19:14] <scottpedia> when Jobs was still around Apple at least had a soul
[22:19:26] <Activ8> all companies want your money
[22:19:30] <Activ8> that's the whole point of a company lol
[22:19:34] <Activ8> some do it better than others
[22:19:51] <scottpedia> my feeling is apple used to be truly different
[22:20:08] <Activ8> did they though
[22:20:30] <Activ8> the first devices cost less to develop
[22:20:34] <scottpedia> you gotta watch a documentary called General Magic 
[22:20:36] <Activ8> the tech was already there
[22:20:44] <scottpedia> that's where apple originated
[22:20:54] <Activ8> as time goes on the new tech had to be designed so needed more devs so prices went up
[22:20:58] <Activ8> and so on and so on
[22:21:50] <scottpedia> you gotta understand, that great innovations are oftentimes born in a small-scale environment
[22:22:05] <scottpedia> more people, more management burden
[22:22:31] <scottpedia> and in the end the company will just become dull like msft did
[22:22:59] <Activ8> yep
[22:24:34] <scottpedia> and also I don't like these new technologies that look chilling every time it comes out
[22:24:46] <Activ8> chilling?
[22:24:59] <scottpedia> I mean cutting-edge
[22:25:32] <scottpedia> for example, touch bar in 2016 and recent tri-camera design
[22:26:24] <Activ8> oh yeh - always stronger, faster, harder
[22:26:24] <scottpedia> from a consumer's point of view, they really just are great as being portrayed by Apple
[22:26:53] <scottpedia> but in fact, some of those designs are for other purposes 
[22:27:09] <scottpedia> like the adoption of usb-type-c
[22:27:45] <scottpedia> when it appeared first in macbook pros in 2016 it was really bad in terms of convenience
[22:28:13] <scottpedia> but for being "apple made", consumer loyalty proped it up
[22:29:20] <scottpedia> the whole reason for the adoption was because apple was a member of the USB standard allience that pushed for faster industry adoption
[22:29:47] <scottpedia> among them, Dell, MSft, HP, etc
[22:30:24] <scottpedia> i had a macbook 2015 until 2019, and it worked great
[22:30:36] <xnaas> how about those awesome butterfly switches that sucked ass for 4 years
[22:30:49] <scottpedia> yeah exactly 
[22:31:06] <scottpedia> i am now on a macbook 2018 with butterfly
[22:31:10] <Activ8> sometimes they get things wrong they human after all
[22:31:14] <scottpedia> it just sucks
[22:31:14] <xnaas> my mid-2012 MBPr (first model without a DVD drive!) still "works" heh
[22:31:19] <Activ8> assumption - mother of all fuck ups
[22:31:29] <xnaas> It also cost me $0, so the value is unreal!
[22:31:49] <Activ8> I had a mac air in 2012 and an iphone purchased for me = 0 cost
[22:31:54] <xnaas> (the real cost: slaving away, miserably, at a job that sucked a lot :P)
[22:31:58] <scottpedia> my 7-year-old thinkpad's keyboard works better than butterfly
[22:32:10] <Activ8> lasted me 8 years the MBA did...
[22:32:11] <xnaas> s/my 7-year-old thinkpad/everything
[22:32:14] <xnaas> ðŸ˜‚
[22:32:18] <scottpedia> it truly sucks
[22:32:25] <Activ8> what stopped it from working was software
[22:32:30] <Activ8> not supporting shit
[22:32:36] <xnaas> I wonder whatever happened to those class actions that were filed over the keyboard
[22:32:46] <xnaas> Sure, it's mostly just a bunch of lawyers getting paid
[22:32:50] <scottpedia> if not for that the battery was going to explode, I wouldn't have abandoned by 2015 model
[22:32:52] <xnaas> but people deserve their $5 checks, damnit! :P
[22:33:08] <scottpedia> in fact I want to buy a new 2015 for the next laptop
[22:33:24] <Activ8> huh
[22:34:11] <scottpedia> also tbh a lot of the new software changes on macos have really been made unethically
[22:34:35] <scottpedia> like deprecation of 32bit execution support
[22:34:46] <Activ8> that happens on every platform
[22:35:00] <scottpedia> it also makes the new os more and more dependent on online services
[22:35:21] <scottpedia> that's against the principles of an end-user os
[22:35:27] <xnaas> I think I dislike the opposite extreme more, though. Microsoft supports way, way too legacy much shit and it's clear Windows suffers because of it. :P
[22:35:44] <xnaas> er, shift "legacy" into the right spot in that sentence in your head, thx
[22:35:45] <xnaas> :P
[22:36:18] <scottpedia> well msft has to do it because windows's got a root too deep xnaas 
[22:36:24] <Activ8> I just got - The Lounge is up to date, but there are out of date packages Run thelounge upgrade on the server to upgrade packages. 
[22:36:29] <Activ8> do I need the packages
[22:36:44] <Activ8> or wait for 4.3.1
[22:37:09] <scottpedia> i think to today windows is merely a burden cause it's impossible to make viable, and big changes with suchh a huge code base
[22:37:22] <Activ8> apple store is back up
[22:37:25] <Activ8> prices are there
[22:37:35] <scottpedia> i'll have to switch to gnu/linux
[22:38:20] <scottpedia> but i have to say macos before .16 had been a very very efficient os
[22:38:37] <scottpedia> great design of its time
[22:38:58] <scottpedia> "everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo"
[22:40:12] <Activ8> I can get an iphone SE for Â£14.12 per month with a trade in for my iphone 8
[22:40:23] <Activ8> SE3 that is
[22:40:33] <scottpedia> i see what you are up to
[22:40:42] *** Quits: fr0stbyte1 (~thelounge@37.19.221.154) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[22:40:44] <scottpedia> you are just like me some years ago
[22:41:31] <Activ8> I won't get one I don't need one however what I'm considering now is how long will my iphone 8 be before it goes bing bong
[22:41:57] <scottpedia> you see that's another problem
[22:42:14] <scottpedia> nowadays you have to buy a new one after a few years
[22:42:35] <scottpedia> it's more like a subscription-based scheme
[22:42:36] <Activ8> it's cheaper for me to get the SE3 now than wait for this to break
[22:42:41] <Activ8> it is you right 
[22:42:49] <Activ8> a hidden subscription model
[22:43:25] <scottpedia> i don't like that. it's addictive. and you lose individual autonomy over this
[22:43:40] <scottpedia> like switching from gas to electric vehicle
[22:44:39] <Activ8> yep
[22:45:19] <scottpedia> you in UK?
[22:45:55] <Activ8> I just checked I can also get an iphone 12 for Â£20 per month with trade in these exclude sim though 
[22:45:59] <Activ8> yes in uk
[22:46:16] <Activ8> I'll bide another year see if I can get that out of my ip8
[22:47:30] <scottpedia> how's UK these days?
[22:47:32] <xnaas> I don't disagree, scottpedia, but I still don't like it. :P
[22:47:38] <xnaas> re: Windows "too big" etc.
[22:48:06] <xnaas> At the end of the day, I don't really care. As long as Windows is a broken mess, I have infinite job security. ðŸ™ƒ
[22:48:36] <scottpedia> xnaas: me too in fact. it's stretching to polars now as it integrates more and more almost-mandatory online service usages
[22:49:07] <scottpedia> you working for google or something? xnaas 
[22:49:07] <xnaas> Yeah...Windows 10 is the last Windows for me.
[22:49:18] <xnaas> On my personal machine, I'll be back to Linux in 2025.
[22:49:24] * xnaas grew up on Debian in the early 2000s
[22:49:26] <Activ8> I won't be moving to 11
[22:49:38] <Activ8> staying with win 10 ltsc 2021 until it expires
[22:49:44] <xnaas> My dad always hated MSFT and Windows, so Linux household for me...lol
[22:50:01] <xnaas> Right now I work for my city's government, scottpedia.
[22:50:09] <scottpedia> I uses win10 enterprise edition, old release, activated with KMS
[22:50:14] <xnaas> I'm The Man now ðŸ¤®
[22:50:23] <scottpedia> it's the most clean version I can find
[22:50:41] <scottpedia> home edition's got too much junk
[22:50:47] <xnaas> Activ8: iirc LTSC gets to go until like 2027
[22:51:02] <scottpedia> i was banned recently on debian-offtopic
[22:51:12] <scottpedia> otherwise i would have been there
[22:51:36] <scottpedia> debian's goot
[22:51:38] <scottpedia> good*
[22:59:25] <Activ8> xnaas Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 Nov 16, 2021	to Jan 12, 2027
[22:59:31] <Activ8> I'm fine with that, plenty scope
