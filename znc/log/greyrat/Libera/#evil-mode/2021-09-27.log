[22:03:13] <wickedjargon> Hi all, was hoping I could get some help on something
[22:03:51] <wickedjargon> I am attempting to create a binding for search and replace all on evil-mode
[22:04:48] <wickedjargon> The vimrc equiv of what I am attempting to do is: 
[22:04:54] <wickedjargon> nnoremap <leader>r :%s//g<Left><Left>
[22:05:08] <wickedjargon> this is what I've produced so far: 
[22:05:10] <wickedjargon> https://pastebin.com/6gGJvyYZ
[22:06:00] <wickedjargon> however, it doesn't work. (i'll explain further)
[22:07:00] <wickedjargon> expected behaviour: go to the minibuffer (for evil command) and enter `:%s//g`
[22:09:02] <wickedjargon> actual behaviour: doesn't go to minibuffer (for evil command). Instead the cursor remains in the main buffer. and inserts a "g" at the beginning of each line
[22:14:22] <wasamasa> the escape bit doesn't do what you think it does
[22:15:59] <wasamasa> there's a good reason why you're supposed to suck it up and write elisp commands
[22:16:23] <wasamasa> keyboard macros in emacs are not meant to be used for more than ad-hoc text manipulation
[22:17:00] <wasamasa> I guess the cursor movement bit is for allowing you to type in something
[22:17:14] <wasamasa> which is better solved by writing an interactive command prompting for something
[22:20:17] <wickedjargon> hi wasamasa, I tried doing the same thing with a set of elisp commands, and someone suggested I use a macro instead
[22:20:52] <wickedjargon> but let me try calling the commands separately as you've suggested. Thanks for your input :)
[22:21:27] <wasamasa> the escape is interpreted by emacs as if in emacs state
[22:21:35] <wasamasa> it is considered a modifier and turns the : into M-:
[22:21:55] <wasamasa> so with the escape I get an error because it tries evaluating everything after that
[22:25:41] <wickedjargon> https://pastebin.com/KT8LmqjB
[22:26:25] <wickedjargon> wasmas, this script does everything i need it to, except it doesn't do the last bit of my keyboard macro "left left"
[22:27:23] <wickedjargon> the cursor remains at the far right: `%s//g<here>` instead of `%s/<here>/g` (where it's supposed to be)
[22:30:10] <wasamasa> that's not what I meant at all, lol
[22:30:46] <wickedjargon> my bad, let me re-read what you wrote
[22:31:16] <wickedjargon> i guess the key part of what you said was "which is better solved by writing an interactive command prompting for something"
[22:34:02] <wickedjargon> I could use the built in search and replace, but I prefer to replicate `nnoremap <leader>r :%s//g<Left><Left>` into emacs. Am I correct in saying this is not done easily?
[22:37:03] <wasamasa> you don't even need to use the built-in search and replace
[22:37:32] <wasamasa> you can instead write an actual command using the most basic elisp functions for this, as opposed as an messing with an interactive command
[22:38:21] <wickedjargon> I see
[22:38:35] <wickedjargon> one last question
[22:38:40] <wickedjargon> (progn
[22:38:40] <wickedjargon>   (evil-normal-state)
[22:38:40] <wickedjargon>   (evil-ex "%s//g")
[22:38:40] <wickedjargon>   (left-char)
[22:38:40] <wickedjargon>   (left-char)
[22:38:42] <wickedjargon>   )
[22:38:45] <wasamasa> use a pastebin
[22:38:48] <wasamasa> ,paste
[22:38:49] <fsbot`> paste: Please do not paste more than three lines into the channel. Use a pastebin like https://bpa.st/+emacs
[22:38:50] <wickedjargon> ok
[22:39:00] <wasamasa> if you do this on a well moderated channel, you get kicked
[22:39:17] <wickedjargon> https://pastebin.com/deP5xU2J
[22:39:54] <wickedjargon> is it true that the reason `(left-char) (left-char)` is not working here is because evil-ex is waiting for the user to complete his/her input?
[22:40:16] <wasamasa> yes or more generally, that's how emacs itself works
[22:40:28] <wasamasa> read in user input, do something, redisplay
[22:40:43] <wickedjargon> i see
[22:40:48] <wasamasa> you can mess around with that, but it quickly gets very complicated
[22:41:00] <wasamasa> to the point where it's less effort to just write an actual command
[22:41:19] <wasamasa> unlike vim, evil is not designed with the goal of its bits being reused for commands
[22:44:16] <wickedjargon> when you say, `write a command`. I guess you mean write a function definition and bind it to a key. That is actually my goal. Once I confirm how to move the cursor `:%s/<here>/g` I will do that.
[22:45:23] <wickedjargon> are you suggesting I review the function body for evil-ex and make my own function based on that?
[22:46:54] <wasamasa> no
[22:47:01] <wasamasa> you write actual buffer manipulating code
[22:47:23] <wasamasa> the go to start of buffer, search for string, replace string, repeat until no longer finding string kind
[22:47:51] <wasamasa> then you turn it into a command and bind it to a key
[22:53:38] <wickedjargon> I believe such a command exists, namely, anzu-query-replace-regexp is what I use
[22:54:07] <wickedjargon> my hope was that I can use evil-ex instead

[23:25:27] <wickedjargon> wasamasa, so I finally accomplished what I was trying to do with: https://pastebin.com/rECy2LfR
[23:26:04] <wasamasa> lol
[23:26:09] <wickedjargon> sorry if i seemed like I didn't understand what you were saying. if that was your impression, you're partly correct.
