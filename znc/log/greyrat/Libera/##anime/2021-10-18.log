[06:36:49] <MootPoot> amigojapan: running different speeds through the machine, it seems like a higher print speed only makes a difference if your item is wide and has multiple areas where the extruder has to make long distances
[06:37:05] <MootPoot> a simple column at 50mm, 100mm and 150mm makes almost no time difference
[06:37:17] <MootPoot> but two seperate columns make a massive difference

[06:41:11] <amigojapan> MootPoot: multiple 3d printers? That sounds expresive

[06:41:20] <MootPoot> amigojapan: kind of
[06:41:31] <MootPoot> a *fast* 3d printer is 1200-1500+
[06:41:39] <MootPoot> a cheap medium is about 250-300
[06:41:59] <MootPoot> and a fast printer is just about 2x the speed of a cheap one

[14:28:43] <emmeka> it's funny how "java" still means coffee even though the island of Java itself is no longer particularly famous for coffee or an important supplier of it. But it was once, like 150 years ago.

[14:30:19] <DunceCotus> java is unstable? Not sure about that
[14:30:20] <pflo> what is wrong with a.equals(b) ?

[14:31:12] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its just trendy to hate on java
[14:31:21] <DunceCotus> probably because it has its own built-in memory management
[14:31:41] <amigojapan> Urchin[emacs]: all I said is "I will port my python programs to Android
[14:31:50] <Urchin[emacs]> lol
[14:31:52] <DunceCotus> and I guess also its a proprietary language
[14:32:08] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: python also had garbage collection
[14:32:10] <Urchin[emacs]> amigojapan: ok, clojure not the best, doesn't work well on android's JVM
[14:32:33] <DunceCotus> python seems unsuitable for complex projects, but I haven't the experience with it
[14:32:57] <amigojapan> Urchin[emacs]: I found a tool to port python apps to Android
[14:33:30] <Urchin[emacs]> wait, Java's code got closed again?
[14:33:50] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: there is also a tool that lets you make python3 typed
[14:34:02] <emmeka> darkwitch I think mocha is actually a coffee variety, named after the port town it was commonly traded from.

[17:27:53] <Sadale> no benefits
[17:28:00] <JesseDesu> it will need a 15 minute reboot
[17:28:05] <Sadale> The benefit is that you'd stop being able to access IPv4 sites
[17:28:18] <Sadale> And IPv4 only sites are still a thing as of today
[17:28:18] <JesseDesu> that doesnt sound good
[17:28:44] <Sadale> If you wish to get IPv6, I'd recommend using both. Ensure that you'd still get to keep your IPv4 address.
[17:28:54] <Sadale> If you aren't sure, don't switch

[17:31:43] <JesseDesu> it says it will work with both ipv4
[17:31:57] <Sadale> JesseDesu, technically, it should be good then.
[17:32:20] <Sadale> I honestly have no idea on how those routers like eero work
[17:32:30] <JesseDesu> i dont either
[17:32:41] <JesseDesu> but if it improves data performance
[17:32:59] <JesseDesu> that means that if any of us start to hoard data it should be more efficient
[17:33:08] <Sadale> huh?
[17:33:18] <JesseDesu> maybe that might alleviate some of the bandwith issues
[17:33:19] <JesseDesu> i dunno
[17:33:28] <Sadale> JesseDesu, I actually highly doubt that switching to IPv6 would improve performance.
[17:33:43] <JesseDesu> it says ipv6 improves it slightly
[17:33:44] <Sadale> You bandwidth's probably limited by your ISP.
[17:34:13] <ButterNoodle> ipv6 doesnt do shit
[17:34:16] <JesseDesu> its already close to 1gbps
[17:34:28] <Sadale> s/You/Your/
[17:34:34] <Sadale> I mean if there's no harm to have a try, you could try it.
[17:34:46] <JesseDesu> i'm gonna try it
[17:34:51] <JesseDesu> i'm ready for the future
[17:34:58] <Sadale> But don't expect any improvement. I'd say that it won't bring you any improvement at all because, again, your bandwidth is limited by your ISP.
[17:35:05] <amigojapan> I started watching cobra Kai
[17:35:05] <ButterNoodle> stacking a 2nd protocol just means one more protocol to fight for bandwidth
[17:35:23] <Sadale> JesseDesu, can you revert back to IPv4 only tho?
[17:35:31] <Sadale> If you could, go ahead and try it and see.
[17:35:33] <JesseDesu> yes
[17:35:35] <JesseDesu> one tap
[17:35:53] <JesseDesu> all the devices on the network will be assigned an ipv6
[17:35:58] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, and one more protocol means one more vulnerability factor.
[17:36:13] <JesseDesu> also, is WPA3 the way to go
[17:36:23] <JesseDesu> i think theres WPA2 something something AES
[17:36:38] <Sadale> I find it annoying how when I setup my firewall on my VPS I need to take care of both IPv4 and IPv6. And my ISP doesn't even provide a IPv6 address so there's no way for me to test for the IPv6 firewall.
[17:36:52] <JesseDesu> my ISP provides it
[17:37:31] <Sadale> Previously my router didn't support IPv6 and I thought that my ISP provided an IPv6 address. Now that I've got a router that supports it. Surprise. My ISP doesn't provide an IPv6 address :/

[17:44:45] <JesseDesu> he has his own router plugged into my gateway
[17:45:10] <Sadale> MootPoot, I mean 50Mbps is enough for streaming multiple HD videos at the same time. If you go 4K tho it may not be sufficient. But none of my monitors in my home support 4K
[17:45:36] <MootPoot> idk, technically yes realistically no
[17:45:49] <MootPoot> maybe its different since you live in such a major city
[17:45:57] <Sadale> JesseDesu, doesn't matter. If you're controlling the gateway you could just throttle it (if there's such a config tho)
[17:46:08] <Sadale> JesseDesu, Maybe cutting him to have 500Mbps. He'd still have enough.
[17:46:14] <MootPoot> but although technically like 10mbps is enough for full 1080p60video, it never seems to be the case here

[21:23:34] <JesseDesu> i dont know
[21:23:46] <JesseDesu> some people will probably think they can print the whole thing
[21:23:50] <JesseDesu> in one go
[21:23:53] <Bco1981> latest bios update 2020/07/02 says support for 3rd Gen AMD Ryzen XT series
[21:23:54] <JesseDesu> and you probably can
[21:24:03] <MootPoot> some models you can, if they dont have moving parts or massive overhangs
[21:24:21] <MootPoot> like I ran the asuna model through cura, seems like I'm going to have to print her head seperately
[21:24:22] <JesseDesu> but that makes for a lot of unnecessary or difficult masking
[21:24:46] <JesseDesu> how are you going to glue the head
[21:24:54] <JesseDesu> are you going to use filler for gaps
[21:25:06] <Bco1981> glue gun ?
[21:25:16] <Bco1981> superglue
[21:25:18] <JesseDesu> do you drill holes for wire pins
[21:25:21] <MootPoot> edit the head for a ball/socket joint
[21:25:25] <MootPoot> just cram it on there
[21:25:28] <MootPoot> friction fit
[21:25:30] <MootPoot> like my cock
[21:25:50] <JesseDesu> thats not how it works
[21:26:04] <JesseDesu> you need super glue or 2 part epoxy
[21:26:10] <MootPoot> why?
[21:26:15] <JesseDesu> and sand paper
[21:26:19] <MootPoot> I'm the one making the model, I can edit it how I want

[21:26:28] <Bco1981> you have a 3d program, make what ever you need to make the head connect.
[21:26:29] <MootPoot> unless you mean from a looks perspective
[21:26:33] <MootPoot> Bco1981: exactly
[21:26:55] <JesseDesu> i'm just saying

[21:27:06] <Bco1981> how it is attached
[21:27:10] <JesseDesu> as someone who has glued and filled and sanded hundreds of times
[21:27:19] <MootPoot> but the thing is, you only HAVE to do that
[21:27:20] <JesseDesu> it looks way better
[21:27:26] <MootPoot> because the maker makes it that way
[21:27:46] <JesseDesu> seams are ugly
[21:27:46] <MootPoot> for example my gundam head is a simple ball socket joint
[21:28:04] <JesseDesu> a gundam is not a human figure
[21:28:04] <MootPoot> although in a gundam seams are part of the style, so I can see why if you're making a anime girl figure
[21:28:14] <JesseDesu> you need seams filled
[21:28:21] <MootPoot> filled with cum
[21:28:25] <JesseDesu> and i can tell you how
[21:28:30] <JesseDesu> and what to buy on amazon
[21:28:35] <JesseDesu> theres light curing putty
[21:28:39] <JesseDesu> dries in 2 minutes
[21:28:43] <JesseDesu> its the best shit out there
[21:29:04] <JesseDesu> you gotta work in the dark

[21:34:57] <Jigsy> Like organs and vaccines.
[21:35:03] <Jigsy> Or blood.
[21:35:10] <JesseDesu> couriers arent the post office
[21:35:19] <Jigsy> I said the mail, not post office.
[21:35:28] <JesseDesu> you mean like couriers with their own jet planes

[22:48:52] <Roey> how old is your car, Satin?
[22:48:56] <Satin> 2015
[22:48:59] <Roey> k
[22:49:16] <Roey> hrm my car is 2018, maybe soon it'll start acting nutso
[22:49:29] <Satin> the less computers in a car the better 
[22:49:32] <Satin> in my opinion
[22:49:33] <Roey> Satin: is this the only thing wrong with it so far?
[22:49:43] <Satin> I mean it's been through a bunch lol 
[22:49:46] <Roey> ah
[22:49:56] <Roey> eventually we'll all just be using robotaxis
[22:50:07] <Satin> 1. two weeks after I got I accidentally slid on the ice and ended up smashing against a wall of snow damaging the front right rim
[22:50:21] <Satin> (despite 3 years with a Ford focus prior with no accidents at all and no incidents)
[22:50:37] <Bco1981> a thing that is stupid is... the car says the tire pressure isn't correct... but it won't tell me which tire... or how much...
[22:51:06] <Bco1981> it obviously knows the awnswer!
[22:51:09] <Satin> 2. I slid into a sort of ditch while trying to drive into the grass to look at deer
[22:52:01] <Satin> 3. thought the dealer had replaced the oil when he sold it to me but apparently not and then I heard grinding sounds and. thought it was funny... tried to restart ignition... continued driving
[22:52:09] <Satin> yeah uh.... we don't talk about that one 
[22:52:12] <Satin> *sweats*
[22:52:28] <Satin> let's just say a certain type of heart transplant occured 
[22:52:39] <Satin> and the odometer isn't accurate 
[22:52:39] <Bco1981> makes sense
[22:52:44] <Satin> that's all I'll say about that.
[22:52:50] <Satin> *hides*
[22:53:42] <ButterNoodle> they dont make em like they use to
[22:54:07] <Bco1981> Satin: you should get a toyota hilux
[22:54:07] <Satin> I never forget to check the oil now 
[22:54:15] <Satin> 4. got shot up by carjackers and stuff, I bled all over the seats or something, rear window cracked and gone, bullefs all over the dashboard and headrest fragmented

[22:58:33] <lastonestanding> the strongest bone in your body is not the penis?!
[22:59:03] <HeTo> well, it's not just the Taliban, Toyotas are popular wherever you have tough conditions
[22:59:52] <Satin> true but it's a problem especially there 
[22:59:57] <Satin> they have secret VINs now 
[23:00:05] <Satin> to make it harder to scrub off that tracking stuff 
[23:00:18] <Satin> among other steps Toyota has taken
