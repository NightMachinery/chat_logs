[13:59:42] <raj>  Hi guys i came accross this laptop of "asus tuf hn256t" laptop. Do you think if there is a better deal at similar price i.e. 800 usd. I need 16gb ram and 4 gb graphics minimum with quad or octa core cpu minimum i5 10th generation 
[14:00:10] <jotham> gaming laptops are a pretty bad idea 
[14:00:21] <jotham> heat is the #1 enemy of battery life

[14:01:02] <jotham> play games that don't require a filthy big gpu, get used to intel graphics (ryzen/amd vega is still a shitshow)
[14:01:09] <jotham> or just get a desktop computer
[14:01:42] <hinst> 5 years ago I would say that gaming laptops are a bad idea but now I believe they're mostly fine
[14:01:44] <raj> jotham: oh
[14:02:36] <jotham> definitely a luxury item though aye hinst 
[14:03:04] <hinst> This specific ASUS laptop seems fine to me; though I would rather get 16 GB or RAM instead of high refresh rate screen; but it is not a big deal
[14:03:22] <jotham> he said he wants 16 geebees too
[14:04:06] <raj> hinst: it is 16 gb 
[14:04:25] <raj> I want a better deal
[14:04:38] <raj> jotham: i could buy a desktop
[14:04:42] <raj> If its a better deal
[14:05:01] <raj> Or how about an external gpu unit
[14:05:08] <raj> Let it head separately
[14:05:17] <raj> And i can plug in and plug out whenever i want to
[14:05:19] <raj> How about
[14:05:23] <raj> Is there such a thong?
[14:05:29] <raj> Thing*
[14:06:11] <jotham> i looked into external gpus with thinkpads
[14:06:18] <jotham> the additional complexity is expensive and buggy
[14:06:25] <jotham> that's why they aren't common place
[14:06:31] <jotham> pci-e is very fussy about timing
[14:06:52] <jotham> and yes, there is sucha  thing
[14:06:54] <jotham> for years
[14:07:26] <jotham> no one can get it to work very well and there is littel consumer demand so it's not being persued by the big companies

[14:10:27] <raj> jotham: can you show me a laptop with external gpu
[14:11:59] <jotham> not really, you can't really buy them, https://support.lenovo.com/ar/en/solutions/acc500012
[14:12:31] <Renderwww> oi, amd drivers on linux are fine!
[14:12:46] <jotham> i was slagging off the vega
[14:12:52] <jotham> not amd stand alone pci-e gpus on linux
[14:13:00] <jotham> vega is amds answer to intel graphics
[14:13:04] <jotham> intel graphics is rock solid
[14:13:13] <jotham> the i9xx series
[14:13:16] <Renderwww> also with video cards having turned into unobtainium the idea of a gaming laptop has become less silly
[14:13:26] <jotham> that's a good point Renderwww 
[14:13:38] <jotham> get the laptop raj
[14:14:09] <Renderwww> external gpus are a thing but you need thunderbolt for it afailk
[14:14:35] <jotham> yeah they have been around for a decade or so easy, but they are buggy and clumsy
[14:14:40] <jotham> like that lenovo one i linked
[14:14:50] <jotham> lots of people have had more success building their own homemade ones
[14:14:50] <Renderwww> which means intel mostly, also you'd have to buy a case for the egpu and those aren't that cheap either
[14:14:51] <raj> jotham: that thunderbolt is what i want
[14:14:56] <raj> Should be there
[14:14:57] <jotham> okay
[14:15:01] <raj> That looks cool
[14:15:06] <raj> Plug n Play
[14:15:08] <raj> 16:12:31 <Renderwww> oi, amd drivers on linux are fine!
[14:15:11] <raj> Oi?
[14:15:42] <Renderwww> think of it as "hey"
[14:16:04] <Renderwww> while talking about gaming, gog just sold me the uncensored wolfenstein new order version
[14:16:17] <Renderwww> quick, someone inform the gestapo
[14:16:20] <jotham> CENSORSHIP?!
[14:16:22] <jotham> R U A NAZI
[14:16:52] <Renderwww> I hope they put more sanctions/fines on polandball for such a terrible transgression!
[14:17:13] <jotham> pretty funny today
[14:17:15] <jotham> france basically said
[14:17:28] <jotham> fuck you uk, we're going to get support for our migrant position from europe
[14:17:32] <raj> jotham: get the asus laptop?
[14:17:37] <jotham> which means france is now gonna side with poland and hungary
[14:18:27] <jotham> maybe in less than 10 years, UKs largest weapons producer (poland) will attack the UK 
[14:19:02] <Renderwww> they'll just withdraw all their polish workers from the uk and everything will collapse without a single shot fired
[14:19:12] <jotham> raj: i'm not giving you economic advice, this is an entertainment forum
[14:19:56] <jotham> external gpu is a bad idea though, sorry to say
[14:20:01] <jotham> great fantasy, terrible reality
[14:20:02] <Renderwww> first time in a long time that I think gog is kinda based compared to steam.
[14:20:19] <jotham> i've been using epic, to play the new satisfactory
[14:20:36] <jotham> which is quite nice, but also, a bit weird, cause it's not factorio and i keep trying to play it like factorio
[14:20:37] <jotham> which is bad
[14:20:45] <jotham> it's like learning java after c++
[14:21:03] <Renderwww> are you using ebic on bingdows?
[14:21:13] <jotham> yep
[14:21:17] <Renderwww> okay
[14:21:19] <jotham> i play games on my wintendo
[14:21:27] <jotham> well i play a lot of rimworld on linux
[14:21:34] <jotham> but on a laptop
[14:22:24] <jotham> i have tried proton for a few games
[14:22:27] <jotham> it's fairly hit and miss
[14:22:28] <Renderwww> surprisingly installing bingows games from gog has become rather convenient too thanks to lutris and gog allowing downloading through 3rd party tools
[14:22:30] <jotham> but seems like the future
[14:23:10] <Renderwww> I mean for multiplayer it's still mostly total garbage because anti-cheat
[14:23:18] <Renderwww> otherwise it "mostly" works
[14:23:21] <jotham> ahh yeah never considered that
[14:23:26] <jotham> i don't play games with other humans
[14:23:29] <jotham> irc is enough
[14:23:50] <jotham> valheim was the last thing i tried to play with other people
[14:23:51] <Renderwww> some random games don't work, others have minor issues like some videos missing which you can fix with installing custom proton version
[14:24:06] <jotham> and 1 of my mates wanted to build AN EPIC BASE and the other one wanted to KILL ALL THE BOSSES
[14:24:11] <jotham> and both were annoyed with each other
[14:24:13] <jotham> and with me
[14:24:20] <jotham> cause i just fucked about in the forest killing animals with a bow
[14:24:21] <Renderwww> hell are other people!
[14:24:31] <jotham> because i found it quite therapeutic 
[14:25:36] <Renderwww> only thing multiplayer I played recently is Monster Hunter World, but the multiplayer part is rather stressfree because people just can dick around however they like without causing much problems. Don't know if it makes you reach once you reach higher levels
[14:25:41] <jotham> got my juden star today
[14:25:46] <jotham> vaccine passport on my phone
[14:25:53] <Renderwww> he's jabbed!
[14:26:02] <Renderwww> has your 5g improved?
[14:26:02] <jotham> been jabbed for like 6 months
[14:26:08] <jotham> probably need to get a booster soon
[14:26:11] <jotham> i always wanted to play monster hunter
[14:26:22] <jotham> govt only just rolled out the vaccine passport system
[14:26:33] <Renderwww> I see
[14:26:48] <jotham> i've been watching netherlands, germany, austria, denmark etc
[14:26:54] <jotham> i apprecaiate it's a controversial point
[14:27:45] <jotham> vaccination is like how religion was in the 70s/80s

[20:19:37] <hinst> why update BIOS ?
[20:21:28] <hinst> I only asking cause I wonder if I also should update BIOS on my PC. I have 2019 version installed and newer versions were released since then, but I never installed the updates

[20:37:55] <Faux> It's worth it if you're gonna be installing new components, or if your CPU vendor likes shipping malware in their CPUs.
[20:44:16] <Renderwww> I sometimes get total system lockups
[20:44:31] <Renderwww> and because the fault can't be linux the only option is a bios update!

[20:58:21] <hinst> I see (I see)
[20:58:50] <Renderwww> also linux audio, not even once!
[21:00:22] <Renderwww> microphone on the built in device on the motherboard doesn't work so I plugged in an old dedicated sound card
[21:00:30] <Renderwww> there the mic works but the output doesn't
[21:01:19] <Renderwww> but that the one on the mainboard doesn't work might be an actual hardware defect because I once violated the mic jck
[21:01:42] <Renderwww> standing up and walking away with a corded headset isn't a high iq move

[21:21:42] <Faux> Wintendo drops the WiFi link every 10GB or so, which is very annoying as its only job is to download Steam games.
[21:51:05] <dukwon> my work laptop drops wifi a couple of random times per day, only for a split second but just long enough to disconnect from my ZNC, causing the buffers to replay when i reconnect
[21:55:00] <hinst> Perhaps you can try updating BIOS

[22:00:28] <dukwon> you can just call it vacuum decay
