[00:45:54] <FunkyBob> caru: why not cron?  (it will inform our recommendations)
[00:46:04] <FunkyBob> caru: _any_ database?  so timestamped files are ok?
[00:46:26] <SnoopJ> caru, you could loop in the process itself if you wanted, but yea, tell us more about what your constraints are here
[00:46:43] <SpeakerToMeat> Ok, it's not entirely python, but here's the gist. I'm working an app with a csv data source. I want it to be quick and easy to edit, so I wouldn't necessarily want to change the data format. right now it's generated via piping of shell scripts. This data file originally had 2 columns, and these are required always, and for that reason and since I don't want to missremember headers, it doesn't have
[00:46:44] <SpeakerToMeat> one. The problem is, now I'd like to add more "fields" to this data, but these are optional. My problems are, first, it will make generating the csv harder, but I will add a command to my app to generate (and modify) these files... the second problem is not all rows will have the same options defined, so 1) There will be rows with a lot of empty fields, which I will have to handle, which is a
[00:46:46] <SpeakerToMeat> bummer... and worse 2) since I can add a row that requires another parameter, I will have to load the whole csv into memory, and write a new file with new headers each time I add a row with a new parameter... I was thinking about the idiocy of using a csv whose first two fields are the required basic, and the third field contains a string with json serialized options.... is there a less insane
[00:46:48] <SpeakerToMeat> option to this?
[00:47:13] <SpeakerToMeat> Sorry I had it all almost typed when caru asked his question
[00:47:47] <grym> SpeakerToMeat: you've just described a sqlite database that has a csv frontend and automatic upserts, unless i'm very much mistaken.  have you looked at simonw's stuff? sqlite-utils and datasette in particular
[00:48:16] *** Quits: TJ- (~root@about/linux/staff/tj-) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[00:48:23] <SpeakerToMeat> grym, sqlite doesn't make a horrible ammount of sense here, these are one (or two at most) use files. created, used and discarded...
[00:48:39] <SpeakerToMeat> And something I'd like to be able to tweak once or twice with a text editor, not having to deal with sql for it
[00:49:46] <SpeakerToMeat> if I have a command to gen/edit the file, I could just give up, and use a json format.
[00:49:52] <grym> SpeakerToMeat: ok.  well, csv.writer will write you empty rows, and reader.DictReader can consume ragged CSV just fine
[00:49:55] <dav1d> A lot more verbose, jsonlines?
[00:50:07] <caru> FunkyBob  SnoopJ I want to know if there are alternate ways than cron
[00:50:16] <dav1d> ah, right you dont wanna switch data format
[00:50:28] <caru> FunkyBob timestamped files are also ok
[00:51:29] <SpeakerToMeat> grym, yeah. I could just recreate all the file when the header changes... I think I could convert my initial two field csv to a shell script calling the create/append command. And just work with a .json file
[00:51:37] <SnoopJ> caru, of course
[00:51:48] <FunkyBob> I find some people have very limited odeas of what counts as a 'database'
[00:51:53] <grym> SpeakerToMeat: err, or just the header line

[00:53:06] <dav1d> SpeakerToMeat, you basically dont want to use one json file, you want to have one json object per row, separated by a newline (usually called jsonlines), so you can keep adding lines easily
[00:53:13] <SpeakerToMeat> FunkyBob, this is a database, but it's ephemeral and SQL or a full document based db layer will add complexity that will benefit me none, and create extra work.

[00:57:37] <SpeakerToMeat> If I add a command to my app, and a script for it, I could do without the csv.
[00:57:47] <dav1d> 65 rows is in the area of "basically everything works"
[00:58:24] <SpeakerToMeat> it feels cleaner/safer to have the keys only for the values the row uses (point for json), but csv is slightly easier to edit on a text editor via ssh (point for csv)

[00:59:13] <SpeakerToMeat> But if I add the subcommand to generate my json, adding a command for changing key values for a single row would take me couple hours work at best, so json and csv become equal there....

[01:34:13] <SnoopJ> the mini-language is the same as what str.format() uses, and **locals() unpacks whatever's in the local namespace into the call.
[01:34:31] <shodan45> ahhh ok
[01:34:39] <shodan45> that's what I want then
[01:34:54] <tdsmith> i think f-strings let you evaluate arbitrary code in ways that str.format() doesn't, for better/worse
[01:35:11] <SnoopJ> tdsmith, in the same sense that writing source code does, yes
[01:35:12] <tdsmith> but that's probably why you can't replicate the f string experience exactly with str.format
[01:35:17] <SnoopJ> (they're literals)
[01:35:50] <SnoopJ> shodan45, just be aware if the string is in an at-all sensitive context, the potential information being risked by the **locals() approach is "everything in the local namespace

[08:17:26] <eliss> so would I still use http.server?
[08:18:17] <Evolver> you could maybe just write an html page with images
[08:18:47] <eliss> sure, all I'm really asking is how to take a variable in python, and put it in an html page, and then show it. http.server doesn't seem to have a way to do that
[08:18:58] <eliss> I can handle everything else
[08:19:17] <Evolver> you don't need a web server to locally render an html page with images
[08:19:26] <Evolver> The browser can read local html files
[08:19:48] <Evolver> You can even use an auto-refreshing browser extension

[08:24:55] <Evolver> eliss: will the value of the variable keep changing? how often?
[08:25:03] <eliss> okay, thanks. I'll start with some simple first
[08:25:10] <eliss> Evolver: maybe on each page reload it can change,
[08:25:18] <eliss> let's say it's the number of files in a folder or something
[08:25:29] <Evolver> eliss: can easily print the value of the var into straight html
[08:25:47] <eliss> I see, so each time regenerate the html, and reload it
[08:25:59] <Evolver> That's the simplest way imho
[08:26:06] <eliss> I'll see which method is easier, and read a bit on templating engine too. thanks!

[09:56:03] <KombuchaKip> I am using python-zeroconf library. How can I get the Zeroconf object to only look for services on any local interface? I've tried Zeroconf(interfaces=my_local_ip_addresses_list), but it's still finding stuff outside of my local machine.
[09:56:43] <grawity> in other words you want it to find only services advertised by localhost?
[09:57:04] <KombuchaKip> grawity: Yes
[09:57:22] <KombuchaKip> grawity: Or ideally, everywhere, but with the local ones returned first.
[09:57:31] <KombuchaKip> grawity: But let's start with the first question.
[09:58:02] <grawity> I would guess either interfaces=["lo"] or interfaces=["::1", "127.0.0.1"] or you get all of them then discard the ones where the server address isn't among my_local_ip_address_list
[09:58:14] <grawity> (since you already have the local IP address list, after all)

[09:59:36] <KombuchaKip> grawity: is ["::1", "127.0.0.1"] guaranteed to be portable?
[10:00:44] <grawity> no, and older Avahi versions didn't even register services on lo, I think that was only added 2-3 years back for CUPS
[10:00:54] <grawity> well, I mean it's portable in the sense that ::1 is always localhost, etc
[10:01:17] <grawity> but services aren't guaranteed to be advertised there by apps...
[10:01:43] <KombuchaKip> grawity: Right. I just want to get services advertised on a local interface before finding ones outside.
[10:02:08] <grawity> then I think it's easiest to get all of them and split by server address

[12:11:29] <ammarsalmi> Hi, when you create dict with the dict(key='Value') python will not accept numbers as keys. And will give you a confusing error message about expression cannot contain assignment.
[12:11:52] <grawity> yes, so if you need numbers as keys, use {} literals instead of dict()
[12:11:57] <grawity> as in {123: "value"}
[12:11:58] <p-i-> ammarsalmi: dict({1:2})

[12:12:23] <grawity> though if you need it in this situation, dict() also takes pairs, e.g. dict([(123, "value"), (456, "other value")])
[12:12:23] <aphysically> I just read about that yeah :D

[12:15:39] <grawity> hmm I wonder how python 10 reacts to dict(123=45)
[12:15:40] <p-i-> ammarsalmi: dict(...) is invoking a Python function with unknown arguments. Internally it will be like `def f(**kwargs):` (and now kwargs is a dict). You can only pass valid variable names as args into a function, and 1 isn't a valid variable name.

I'm using univariate time series algorithm there. But It's not working as expected. I created a data pattern just to see if it's gonna predict the next element. My pattern consists of 23 numbers. all different.
[14:08:19] <savolla> I copyed and pasted the same number sequence like 150k times and led the algorithm learn for like 20 minutes. The result is not correct! Do you guys have any idea why the machine learning model cannot see the pattern? Any little help will be so helpful. I'm new to this field. thank you!

I added the question mark at the end. this is what the AI should find. it's 8 as you can see. now I added the
[14:22:26] <savolla> same pattern consecutively for 150.000 and led the ai learn this pattern but it is still predicting the wrong number. Maybe there is another algorithm or solution? Or the machine learning approach is not suitable for this kind of problem?

[15:10:37] <Yhg1s> I'm just wondering if the leak is actually there. Something holding a reference to the CTracers when it shouldn't, or without being traversable by the cyclic-G
[15:10:40] <Yhg1s> GC.
[15:11:41] <Yhg1s> I don't see anything wrong with your fix, even though it doesn't work. Leaving tp_alloc/tp_free/tp_del/etc empty is fine for GC objects, as PyType_Ready() will fill them in with the GC versions if you have HAVE_GC set
[15:12:58] <nedbat> Yhg1s: a separate question: I got this pattern from a doc someplace, but why do this?  https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/blob/nedbat/bug1283/coverage/ctracer/module.c#L39  Why not init tp_new in the C struct initializer?
[15:13:46] <Yhg1s> Even if it didn't, the GC tracking is only important for the *start* of GC tracing. If everything pointing to your objects is going to be GC-tracked itself, it doesn't matter if your type is (but you still have to implement tp_traverse)
[15:14:15] <f8e4> how do expose an entrypoint in a venv globally, eg in terminal
[15:14:17] <Yhg1s> nedbat: I don't know why that pattern exists.
[15:14:47] <Yhg1s> f8e4: set PATH to include your virtualenv's bin directory, or add a symlink to the binary you want to expose to a directory already in PATH (like ~/bin), or use pipx.
[15:15:01] <Yhg1s> nedbat: I can take a closer look at the leak if you want, if I can reproduce it locally.

For example if previous steps set ctx.foo1 = "Hello", ctx.foo2= "Bye", then in a later step I'd like to see which attributes have been set. It's pretty tricky to do this without knowing the name of the attributes. Looking at the __getattr__ method implementation was enough to

[17:32:31] <mav`rik> Hi all, is there anything like a Stream whose read method would be via repeated application of a function (or a generator)? So if for example I wanted to create a large CSV stream, but didn't want to store it all in memory I could feed `csv.write` one of these objects and calls to `read` would result in multiple calls to `fn` (or iterations of a generator) so I don't fill memory?

[17:34:22] <Yhg1s> mav`rik: do you mean csv.writer()? Its writerows() method takes any iterable, including generators.

[17:36:39] <zothix> thanks
[17:36:51] <mav`rik> Yhg1s: sorry, yes, typo, but I mean that the `writerows` would only be applied sufficient to fulfil a request to the same input stream's `.read(some_length)`  so if I had `stream = ThisThing()`, and `csv.writer(stream)` then I could do `stream.data_filler = some_function_which_writes_a_new_row_to_writer`
[17:37:16] *** Joins: Enitin (~Enitin@82.102.22.85)
[17:37:30] <bjs> mav`rik: i'm a little confused, the argument to csv.writer is the place to write the output csv to,  not where the input stream came from
[17:37:36] *** Quits: GNUmoon (~GNUmoon@gateway/tor-sasl/gnumoon) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[17:38:03] <grawity> it is also possible to .bind() the socket to a specific local port upfront, e.g. you can send packets 10022 -> 10011 if you want
[17:38:07] <zothix> grawity, so basically alot of clients will reply to me on this port, is there a way i could specify this random port, so i can just add a continuous listener on it?
[17:38:27] <bjs> mav`rik: you go `writer = csv.writer(output_location);  writer.writerows(input)`
[17:38:30] <bjs> roughly
[17:38:32] <grawity> e.g. if it's an IPv4 (AF_INET) socket, you should be able to sock.bind(("0.0.0.0", 10022))

[18:22:20] <kek_> hi, I'm still confused as to how python people read docs of libs. E.g. https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BCELoss.html here it says "Output: scalar." but yet the type is "<class 'torch.Tensor'>". Am  missing something? An object isn't realyl a scalar to me. Sure, I expect a loss function to return a scalar but the function actually returns an object. So why does it say it returns a scalar?
[18:23:50] <kek_> I guess it makes sense in the context of pytorch because they probably handle all numbers using their tensor thingie but still. I have this problem all the time and end up either reading the source or print(type(foo)).
[18:23:53] <Yhg1s> kek_: everything is an object.
[18:24:01] <Yhg1s> kek_: So, a scalar is also an object.

[18:27:48] <grym> lots of nouns have many domain specific senses
[18:27:49] <Yhg1s> kek_: other than the apparent misunderstanding of what an object is, the confusion here doesn't seem to be Python-specific. Torch/numpy/tensor-specific, perhaps.

[20:18:19] <bjs> and nothing to do with the random module at all, it can be hard to tell
[20:19:21] <ArtfulDodger> Could it be a loss of time due to the random seed that would be picked more often with choice()? (I don't know when it is actually picked)
[20:20:20] <bjs> ArtfulDodger: have you considered that the time difference is that the random() version has many function calls and a list comprehension and a Python loop over a range()
