[00:45:48] <drobilla> Probably better to consider the organization aspect and the playing aspect as totally separate things
[00:45:52] <dimadima> meff[m]: no way for them to store locally on their phones

[00:46:21] <drobilla> I've never seen anything that's a decent media center frontend that also is decent at renaming/tagging/etc anyway, but I'm no expert
[00:46:26] <meff[m]> dimadima: album art yeah it's lacking, but you can long press and click "Save" which works okay if your friends are techie enough
[00:46:28] <technomancy> everything else just works out of the box, but this is super fiddly and you have to track down some weird obscure wiki page to support the extremely advanced operation of *checks clipboard* playing audio
[00:46:48] <drobilla> so e.g. I organize stuff with $WHATEVER, the ultimate target being to have it work nicely in Kodi

[04:28:22] <drakonis> lol
[04:28:24] <drakonis> aight
[04:28:33] <drakonis> also, rails with more magic, but in the right place.
[04:28:36] <c355E3B> but the short version is that I feel the industry isn't good at understanding why things were successful and understanding how we can build off of past success
[04:29:07] *** Quits: pyrorock (~Dont@46.136.35.110) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[04:29:24] <drakonis> i think the magic in rails is sprinkled on bad places, i really wish it didn't have all of the inflection based magic
[04:29:30] <drakonis> it made getting into rails much harder than it has to
[04:29:52] <drakonis> as well as all of the drop in libraries
[04:30:09] <c355E3B> I think the way they used inflection was fine IFF they changed the way migrations happened
[04:30:27] <c355E3B> letting end users see table names was a mistake in a system like that
[04:30:34] <drakonis> the thing with inflections is that it breaks activerecord calls
[04:30:45] <drakonis> since i need to figure out the way it transforms the table names into calls
[04:30:49] <c355E3B> I'm aware
[04:31:04] <c355E3B> so instead, take away my ability to name tables and columns and fix the issue
[04:31:19] <drakonis> it butchers my language
[04:31:39] <c355E3B> That does not surprise me at all
[04:31:57] *** Joins: pyrorock (~Dont@46.136.35.110)
[04:32:22] <drakonis> the other thing that's horrid is that even if i were to use english for the table and columns, it'd still find a new way to butcher it
[04:32:57] <drakonis> a novel way to butcher words
[04:33:23] <drakonis> otoh, i hate how rails has this philosophy to be a kitchen sink but doesnt really do it well
[04:33:50] <drakonis> anycable is substantially better than actioncable

[04:37:00] <drakonis> i wont say that the rails devs arent trying, but it isn't the best it can be
[04:37:20] <drakonis> it's getting superceded by other options
[04:37:46] <c355E3B> this is part of the reason I'm on two teams at work...
[04:37:54] <drakonis> i see
[04:38:02] <drakonis> two teams though?
[04:38:05] <c355E3B> Yeah
[04:38:06] <drakonis> which ones?
[04:38:13] <Church> c355E3B: Yeah writing a really small web app in Rust right now. I could use a nice rails like setup almost.
[04:38:23] <Church> I guess Rocket kinda suffices for now
[04:38:26] <c355E3B> I'm on the tracing teams for Ruby and the infra teams for our custom time series metrics store
[04:38:41] <drakonis> ah, neat.
[04:38:55] <c355E3B> Which means I end up  supporting Ruby/Python/Go/Javascript/Java/C++ and C...
[04:39:04] <drakonis> haha welp
[04:39:06] <drakonis> that's a lot
[04:39:12] <c355E3B> Yeah

[04:39:38] <drakonis> that's good to hear

[04:39:48] <c355E3B> on the flip side, we are forced to use every tool that gets hype in the industry

[04:39:58] <c355E3B> Yeah stripe has one

[04:40:26] <c355E3B> Maybe?
[04:40:30] <drakonis> its one of the big bugbears about ruby
[04:40:31] <c355E3B> EventMachine needs to die in a fire first
[04:40:34] <drakonis> its so fucking slow ahhhhhhhhhhh
[04:40:41] <drakonis> everything about it is so slow
[04:40:44] <c355E3B> Honestly, Ruby is just as slow as python and node in most cases
[04:41:03] <c355E3B> 90% of app slowness is network IO to your database, not the language
[04:41:15] <drakonis> or rather
[04:41:30] <drakonis> well, this one's a rails thing, which is that it scales poorly

[04:43:05] <drakonis> i wish they'd finally do away with the monolith thing
[04:43:20] <c355E3B> So I kinda agree with them on that
[04:43:36] <c355E3B> the issue is that a lot of developers seem to have issues around keeping stuff clean
[04:43:44] <c355E3B> or maybe we don't have tools to help do that?
[04:44:05] <drakonis> i don't know if its mainly a problem with how rails wants the developer to organize their code or something else

Once you understand the nature of objects you are working with, you don't have to learn "how-tos" anymore, because you simply how you can operate on these things. And then all you need is having a good tool to do what you want, be it the git cli or magit or any other porcelain you like.
