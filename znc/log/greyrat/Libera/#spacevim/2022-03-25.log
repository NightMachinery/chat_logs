[01:10:03] <SpaceVimBot> <dq-dd> I'm trying to use `lua` in `bootstrap#before` with nvim and it's not working.    are there known issues with this?
[01:12:44] <SpaceVimBot> <dq-dd> specifically this command `lua require("zk").setup()`
[01:13:47] <SpaceVimBot> <dq-dd> I get this error ` [ Error ]        exception: Vim(lua):E5108: Error executing lua [string ":lua"]:1: module 'zk' not found:`
[01:14:03] <SpaceVimBot> <dq-dd> but if I run the same command manually once nvim is running, it works
[01:16:14] <SpaceVimBot> <dq-dd> I've tried moving it to bootstrap#after but it doesn't work or throw an error

[07:56:45] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> make sure this plugin is in rtp before you run `:lua` command

[20:58:59] <SpaceVimBot> <dq-dd> I'm installing the plugin via  `[[custom_plugins]]` in init.toml.  how do I add it to rtp?
[21:02:54] <SpaceVimBot> <dq-dd> I see `~/.cache/vimfiles/repos/github.com/mickael-menu/zk-nvim` in `:set runtimepath?`
[21:07:02] <SpaceVimBot> <dq-dd> I had bootstrap#after misconfigured, moving the lua command to there now works.  thanks for your help
