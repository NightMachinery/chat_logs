[00:05:54] <morganu> I dont think it is important to my thinking now. It say Ubuntu can change packages if they are Upstream to it and IDC about that.  - what I do want to know is what is going on that I must kill chrome (or firefox) every day or two of the computers slows towards freeze.

[00:07:58] <oerheks> upstream means it is taken from the original source/development
[00:08:07] <dubiousness> What it means is that you'll get the version of the packages and any tweaks that the Ubuntu community provides, installing the "upstream" version of a package nets you what the developer of that package wants it to look/feel/control like.

[04:58:00] <noarb> when logging in with ssh, when does update-motd get run? I'm looking at sshd configuration with 'PrintMotd no' but I still get that message when I log in, does it run at a different time in the login?
[04:58:58] <wez> noarb: It runs in crontab I believe, not at login time.

[12:20:18] <Dr-007> bleh, i wanted to edit stuff on a wiki page but it's hard to find the entrance to do it at all. it's this page: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MakeALiveCD/DVD/BootableFlashFromHarddiskInstall where 'install grub to flash disk' it has this command: `sudo grub-install --no-floppy --force --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdc` it should be `sudo grub-install --removable --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdc`
[12:20:37] <Dr-007> with no-flopy it would hit my efi partition on the usb but grub would just say "System reset" and reboot over and over
[12:22:12] <oerheks> Wiki is locked down, to avoid troll edits; To edit the Ubuntu Wiki, join the Ubuntu Wiki Editors team on Launchpad. https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-wiki-editors
[12:22:20] <Dr-007> and maybe you could add a little section / explanation above it explaining you can use 2 partitions. an efi partition and a ntfs/ext4 partition. the last one so you can store large .iso's onthere. if you follow that guide then youll end up with a fat32 partition and you're restricted to 4GIG isos
[12:22:24] <oerheks> else mail them with your edit request.
[12:22:46] <Dr-007> oerheks, oki doki
[12:22:50] <Dr-007> im not gonna do that
[12:22:55] <Dr-007> i dropped a line inhere :)
[12:23:03] <oerheks> a small partition extra is called persistent, there are guides for that
[12:23:19] <Dr-007> no the persistent part is not the extra partition
[12:23:21] <oerheks> mkusb can do that, perhaps rufus too
[12:23:37] <Dr-007> you can save the persistent part in a file or in another partition

[15:55:50] <Mrokii> Hello. Not sure if I'm in the right room for this, but I have an HD that might possibly be broken. It doesn't seem to contain a partition anymore (superblock broken?), and I'm not sure how I can fix that. Mounting failed with this: "column: read failed: Input/output error

[15:56:29] <EriC^^> Mrokii: sounds like either connection or hardware error
[15:57:38] <Mrokii> EriC^^: So what could I try? Another sata-cable maybe? Or another sata-port, to see if that's the problem?
[15:57:45] <EriC^^> Mrokii: try 'sudo apt-get install smartmontools && sudo smartctl -a /dev/sdX'

[15:59:15] <EriC^^> yeah, i think you should get another hdd and try to copy the data over if possible, or use gddrescue to image the disk

[17:47:30] <Mrokii> Hello. I have a drive that has suddenly gone into read-mode, and I had to restart. Now, the drive has "lost" its partition information, and a quick search with testdisk didn't show anything. I wonder, would writing a new partition table (it was the complete HD bevore) show the files again? Smart-tools btw can identify the disc, but apart from that only gives input/output errors.

[18:09:23] <Mrokii> In that case I assume my only chance would be a new HD (which I need anyway) and ddrescue or something like that, to try to get the files.

[18:58:09] <tomreyn> krumelmonster: i'm just trying to understand whether you may already have broken something by what you did so far. you probably have these layers: disk sda -> partition sda6 -> dmcrypt-luks layer sda6_crypt -> LVM2 PV -> LVM2 VG(s)/LV(s).
[18:58:51] <krumelmonster> Yes, I did resize the luks partition using gparted

[19:00:33] <krumelmonster> according to gparted and lsblk yes but not according to vgdisplay
[19:00:49] <krumelmonster> So yes, it is

[23:03:32] <en11gma> i have windows 11 (TPM enabled) installed on my nvme m.2 in my x570 motherboard. i want to use a ubuntu live usb to install ubuntu to an "external hdd usb to sata adapter" which from what i seen is possible. during the install process i just select that drive and also select that drive for the partition manager/grub to be installed too. the problem i have is after i reboot into the usb-hdd
[23:03:32] <en11gma> ubuntu is at some point there will be an ubuntu update and it will overwrite my windows 11 partition manager and take control. this is what i do not want. is there a way to keep both operating systems seperate and just select which drive to boot through F12 boot menu
[23:03:50] <en11gma> and also what happens if i remove the usb-hdd ubuntu from usb connector?
[23:04:05] <en11gma> still leaving my windows 11 nvme m.2 conencted of course

[23:08:50] <leftyfb> en11gma: why do you say an ubuntu update is going to overwrite your windows 11 partition?
[23:08:51] <en11gma> i think it happens when ubuntu updates and there is a kernel update or a grub2 update
[23:09:00] <en11gma> because it does everytime
[23:09:23] <en11gma> this isnt my first rodeo with a seperate 2 drive dual boot situation
[23:09:56] <en11gma> i want to control which OS gets booted with the F12 not with a partition manager
[23:11:19] <en11gma> and then when it picks the drive i select it boots to that partition manager which should only see ubuntu or should only see windows depending on which drive i select with F12
[23:12:04] <en11gma> i do not want windows partition manager giving me the option to boot ubuntu and i do not want ubuntu partition manager to give me option to boot windows

[23:13:46] <en11gma> but somewhere along the line ubuntu tries to take over and run it. it will install grub2 to the windows drive. does grub2/ubuntu look for windows partitions and then try to overwrite windows partition manager even when ubuntu install was told to install grub2 to the ubuntu drive?
[23:14:22] <en11gma> i mean how is this preventable? only way i found so far was to disconnect sata cables for the os i didnt want to boot
[23:15:17] <en11gma> but now i dont have any sata drives. just the nvme m.2 (windows) and a sata drive i want to use as external drive for ubuntu with usb2sata adapter

[23:20:49] <tomreyn> do you understand how uefi booting works / how it's supposed to work, with a single efi system partition on a single disk, containing boot loaders which the firmware chooses from?
[23:21:52] <EriC^> en11gma: you basically don't want grub-install to ever run on the ubuntu install, you could manually pin the package so it never gets updated, and replace grub-install binary with something like /bin/true
