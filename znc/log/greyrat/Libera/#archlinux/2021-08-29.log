[00:02:17] <lambda> th0rne: to reset the list, just having `ExecStart=blah` in the override would run both the existing `ExecStart` in the base unit as well as `blah`
[00:02:22] <NerdWannaBe> Seems that this bug appears about late 5.10 - early 5.11 kernel version, what if i use the stable Arch kernel ? is it a good idea ?
[00:02:31] <rcf> th0rne: multiple ExecStart commands can exist, you need to clear them with an empty ExecStart when overriding 
[00:02:39] <th0rne> Ah, I see. Thanks, guys.

[06:59:35] <NerdWannaBe> Ok but where are the files dowloaded with: asp checkout linux-lts ?
[06:59:57] <kevr> OH. You should have a folder named linux-lts wherever you ran that command.
[06:59:59] <NerdWannaBe> oh! found them
[07:00:04] <NerdWannaBe> Yes i do
[07:00:15] <kevr> Yeah. In the trunk/ subdirectory in there, that's where the PKGBUILD is
[07:00:28] <kevr> just make sure you git checkout to the commit you want

[07:02:24] <NerdWannaBe> This will install version 5.10 ? the same install with: sudo pacman -S linux-lts ?
[07:02:37] <kevr> indeed, you need to checkout to an older one if you want an older one.

[07:04:56] <kevr> After you check out to that, you can verify where you are at in the git history by viewing `git log` and just looking at the commits at the top.
[07:05:35] <kevr> Additionally, you will notice that PKGBUILD has changed after checking out.

[09:46:22] <predicament> but im not so sure its that actually.  when does it freeze
[09:46:43] <predicament> you said if you try to disable the intel gfx then it gets stuck?
[09:47:03] <predicament> check /var/log and dmesg and anything else.  you should run a verbose boot
[09:47:05] <gulzar> the nvidia, not intel
[09:47:14] <predicament> oh, so you disable nvidia and it gets stuck
[09:47:25] <predicament> i dont think you can use wayland.
[09:47:31] <predicament> i'm not completely sure about that
[09:47:31] <gulzar> yes only if  power is connected or any app like FF is up
[09:47:35] <predicament> but i do not think you can
[09:47:49] <predicament> and also, that's a power management thing
[09:47:58] <gulzar> what should I look in dmesg
[09:48:05] <predicament> oh god
[09:48:32] <gulzar> it's a big log
[09:48:33] <predicament> anything that you see that is a major error, im not much of help right now, try /var/log/Xorg0.log
[09:48:38] <predicament> look in there
[09:48:43] <predicament> see if it gives any clues
[09:49:05] <predicament> try to replicate the problem and | grep nvidia or | grep graphics

[09:56:01] <predicament> intel is what it detected first
[09:56:01] <gulzar> can't we just diable nvidia on boot for arch
[09:56:08] <predicament> you could if you wanted

[10:01:04] <gulzar> render-offload, optimus-manager
[10:01:12] <predicament> also um.. try appending nomodeset to the kernel line at startup.  you know, when you see "Arch Linux" in Grub.. just press e, then go to where it says "quiet" and delete quiet  -- and replace that with apparmor=1 security=apparmor udev.log_priority=3 --- make sure you sudo pacman -S apparmor
[10:01:19] <predicament> render offloading is a method i use
[10:01:35] <predicament> but it's not recommended, it reminds me of a reverse proxy haha
[10:01:49] <predicament> that shouldn't be your first choice
[10:02:14] <predicament> so then you'll see your boot process
[10:02:43] <predicament> so if something fails.. you know what fails
[10:02:46] <predicament> and why.
[10:03:13] <predicament> but yeah try what i said to do
[10:03:24] <predicament> you might get lucky but its saying to not use the modesetting driver
[10:03:42] <predicament> modesetting is the driver for nvidia when it's not using the proprietary drivers i think
[10:03:56] <predicament> i think intel too
[10:04:12] <predicament> i forget to be honest, but it's like a generic driver

[13:15:08] <grawity> hmm not sure I would describe it that way, no

[13:15:40] <Nitrousoxide> You know what, I'll shut up and read this.
[13:15:42] <Nitrousoxide> Thank you
[13:15:43] <grawity> a block cipher always works with blocks; 128 bits in, 128 bits out
[13:16:36] <grawity> in the CBC diagram, for example, block 1 is XOR'd with the IV; block 2 is XOR'd with the encrypted block 1; block 3 is XOR'd with the encrypted block 2; etc
[13:17:19] <Nitrousoxide> Hmm, now that I consider the word "block" in block cipher, "placed onto the end of" was a pretty stupid suggestion
[13:17:32] <Nitrousoxide> So allow me to rephrase
[13:17:56] <Nitrousoxide> Is it essentially cryptographically secure data mathematically combined with the data to be encrypted?

[14:07:04] <th0rne> Is there a way to make an alias but so that the params are not at the end?
[14:07:26] <grawity> if you want to preserve sanity -- no; make it a function instead
[14:07:42] <grawity> foo() { the_actual_foo "$@" --really; }
[14:08:10] <th0rne> Yeah, that's what I thought - but what's the not sane way?
[14:08:53] <grawity> I've seen old posts doing this using the '!' history expansion inside an alias, although it might have been more of a csh thing (where it was the *only* way or something?)
[14:09:02] <grawity> like !3 for the 3rd arg or something
[14:09:17] <th0rne> Basically what's I'm trying to do is that a lot of programs don't set their tmux window names, but I'd for them to.

[14:10:33] <th0rne> It's sometimes hard to find the correct window when half of them are called 'python'.
[14:10:48] <grawity> so you'd instead use ranger() { tmux renamew ranger; command ranger "$@"; tmux set -w automatic-rename on; }
[14:11:21] <grawity> ('command' makes sure to run actual binary and not the same function again)

[15:01:11] <ShapeShifter499> no, it comes with dracut hooks 
[15:01:32] <Namarrgon> then you get to write the hooks yourself
[15:01:55] <ShapeShifter499> it's the only arch linux package I've ever wanted to install so far that supports dracut over mkinitcpio and I'm not sure why

[15:08:39] <ShapeShifter499> Namarrgon: do you have any ideas as to why the clevis package would support dracut over mkinitcpio

[17:42:27] <th0rne> I don't think it was a notification program per se, poor choice of words by me.
[17:43:37] <th0rne> Iirc, it was a program that used cairo, maybe, to draw a big bar on top of anything, in X. Like a progress bar.
[17:44:10] <th0rne> It looked extremely similar to the mpv seek bar.
