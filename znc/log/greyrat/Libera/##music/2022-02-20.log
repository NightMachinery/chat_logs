[07:23:33] <R2robot> oh.
[07:23:35] <louipc> need the sauce to cut the bitter
[07:23:40] <louipc> then its great

[23:17:26] <nativetexan> yeah slither is a fav
[23:17:35] <murthy> nativetexan: keep jammin brother 
[23:17:55] <macrobat> I suspect the below-knee pockets are just for show. impractical. thigh pockets should have more volume than those back pockets, which if filled, would make it harder to sit
[23:18:20] <R2robot> more pockets = more tater tots
[23:18:42] <nativetexan> corn
[23:19:07] <Jan> macrobat: factor in the fact that cellphones are now the size of paperback books, and girl pockets are only 50% the size of guy ones.

[23:20:08] <macrobat> I wonder how women sit on their backpocket phones without damaging them
[23:20:31] <Jan> more back in the bad old days of hipster jeans
[23:20:33] <R2robot> remember bent phone gate? They got damaged
[23:20:41] <Jan> yeah that happened because of low riding jeans
[23:22:05] <nativetexan> texts are coming in, the gang might game here soon

[23:24:12] * Jan hates barbershop with the fire of a thousand supernovas
[23:25:09] <macrobat> it is not the best song ever, but the audience singing 3 part harmony without reherasing. srsly impressive
[23:25:34] <macrobat> the clarinet trio at the end is nice too
[23:25:45] <nativetexan> yep, game on

[23:31:23] <macrobat> ledzep
[23:31:32] <R2robot> best zep
[23:32:20] <MusicalDillo> Zep is an old favorite.  Used to play my drums to it when I was a teen
[23:32:33] * R2robot is too young to have seen zepplin live, but did see Robert Plant live :D
[23:32:41] <R2robot> and he did a couple of zepplin songs
[23:32:50] <MusicalDillo> nice :)
[23:33:02] <MusicalDillo> I never caught them live
[23:33:17] <R2robot> dang
[23:35:10] <Panther> I had tix to the concert right after Bonzo died, so I didn't get to see them either.
[23:35:37] <R2robot> aww shit
[23:35:42] <R2robot> that's rough
[23:36:24] <Panther> I forget what he drank that morning, something like 4 quadruple screwdrivers or some whacky amount of booze.
[23:36:41] <R2robot> sheesh.
[23:37:52] <R2robot> I had to leave the Robert Planet concert a bit early.  My buddy was drinking beer that he had people buy for him. We were both under age.  And then he was smoking weed that they were passing around...  He ended up puking on the people in front of us and ran. 
[23:37:54] <Panther> "During the journey, Bonham asked to stop for breakfast, where he drank four quadruple vodka screwdrivers (16 shots between 400 and 560 ml). He then continued to drink heavily after arriving at rehearsals."
[23:38:09] <R2robot> So of course I had to run too so I wouldn't lose him.  No cell phones back then. lol
[23:38:20] <Panther> Yuck
[23:38:32] <R2robot> yeah.. I felt so bad
[23:38:42] <R2robot> THey were looking at ME like WTF?!  
[23:38:55] <R2robot> ¯\_(⊙︿⊙)_/¯ 
[23:39:21] <R2robot> sucks for them big time.. sucked for me cos I missed part of the show..
[23:39:21] <Panther> A friend of mine just passed out last weekend on his way home from a party. He kinda just collapsed in the snow, and some nice ppl helped him home.
[23:39:45] <Panther> He was drinking a lot, and then took a few killer hits of weed.
[23:40:00] <R2robot> sheesh
[23:40:10] <Panther> Yeah, I bet.. could your friend get back to watching it?
[23:40:48] <R2robot> I wish, he was almost crying.  He felt so bad and just kept saying "take me home" over and over
[23:41:10] <R2robot> he threw up again on the way home.. out the window and on the side of my car =/
[23:41:16] <Panther> Sux
[23:41:42] <R2robot> the whole say he was super out of it..  Noway we could have stayed and at least watched from the side or soemthing
[23:42:10] <R2robot> good thing your friend got help..
[23:42:16] <R2robot> passing out in the snow can't be good
[23:42:58] <Panther> Prolly not, only if he fell, at least the snow cushioned the fall. :)
[23:43:19] <R2robot> True :)
