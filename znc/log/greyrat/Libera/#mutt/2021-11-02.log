[15:30:11] <greyrat> My outgoing email setup suddenly broke. I am using an unencrypted mail2 docker server. Here is mutt's logs: https://paste.gnugen.ch/paste/jytp
[15:30:11] <greyrat> I guess I should somehow force mutt not to use =starttls=, but using `ssl_force_tls= ssl_starttls= mutt` did not work. (I do NOT want TLS.)

[23:35:44] <mingdao> yang: Mine is threaded, but messages are displayed in date order if not in a thread.  Your requested paste entry '1217681' could not be found 
[23:39:57] <mingdao> yang: This is what it looks like https://0x0.st/-nGr.png
[23:40:10] <mingdao> They are all in date order except when threaded.
[23:41:53] <mingdao> To keep change your sort order in mutt, press o and then choose from this line that should display:  Sort Date/Frm/Recv/Subj/tO/Thread/Unsort/siZe/sCore/sPam/Label?:
[23:42:32] <mingdao> So t for threaded, which is what I think you want; or d for date, which sounds like what you have now.
