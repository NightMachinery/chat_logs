[16:30:59] <Ristovski> alternatively, I could come up with a way to detect the adbd tcp socket on the phone going established (when a remote adb client connects to it), but I haven't figured out how I would pull that off yet
[16:32:23] <Ristovski> actually, I could use inotify to monitor /data/misc/adb/adb_keys, and it would catch both USB and TCP
