[00:37:43] <jjhoo> I would not rely on that kind of thing, who knows if that kind of software distribution becomes a problem for pypi.org

[00:55:39] <ASau> zilti[m]: one of them is due to the infamous fork problem.

[03:59:25] <siiky> jcroisant thanks for the input! and wasamasa thanks for the links! I'll read them and try to get something working, and come back here if I have more questions (and to say thanks) :) any one of these days...
[04:08:56] <siiky> btw anyone around here has any interest in an Invidious API egg? I have one for some time now that I use only for the searching functionality; other than the searcing endpoint it's not at all tested, though all non-authenticated endpoints are implemented... Some days ago I added support for their recently added "API"/"CORS" fields so that it's now possible to programmatically filter for "good" instances to 
[04:09:02] <siiky> use (assuming instances correctly advertise their settings), so the egg should now be somewhat usable

[22:12:39] <jcroisant> Does anyone have a request of a C library they would like CHICKEN bindings for? Something that uses strings a lot would be ideal, maybe a database, compression, or networking library?

[22:38:52] <teiresias> I've thought at times that libcurl bindings would be a nice to have.  It's a beast though.
[22:49:23] <Zipheir> jcroisant: LeoNerd's libtickit http://www.leonerd.org.uk/code/libtickit/
[22:50:13] <Zipheir> I started writing Chibi bindings for it, but I didn't get that far due to other projects taking up time.  It should be a pretty straightforward binding project, though.
[22:51:15] <Zipheir> It's a clear and reasonably simple TUI library.
[22:58:12] <Zipheir> Now, making an interface that isn't a bunch of imperative do-stuff! statements, that's the real challenge.
[22:58:59] <jcroisant> teiresias, Zipheir: Both good suggestions, thanks!
[23:00:42] <jcroisant> I could definitely do at least libcurl's "easy" interface, to start with.
[23:03:22] <jcroisant> libtickit looks cool, I'll think about how I want to approach it
