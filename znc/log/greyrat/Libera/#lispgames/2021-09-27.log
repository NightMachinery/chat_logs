[00:38:18] <borodust> dto: any sounds?
[00:38:38] <dto> i heard a brief sound when it started

[00:47:40] <borodust> try grep avx /proc/cpuinfo
[00:47:50] <borodust> does it return anything?
[00:48:15] <rtypo> haha, i was doing exactly that
[00:48:20] <rtypo> nothing
[00:48:57] <rtypo> brb buying new pc and will try again :)
[00:49:01] <borodust> ;p
[00:49:02] <rtypo> i actually should
[00:49:17] <borodust> avx was added around 2011
[00:49:32] <rtypo> darn! mine is from 2010 (i5-460M)
[00:49:42] <borodust> rtypo: you are the second person that have that problem
[00:50:01] <borodust> i might drop requirement to sse4.2 later
[00:51:01] <borodust> i'm not even sure AVX gives any gains for alien-works ;p
[00:51:07] <borodust> i just dropped it in for fun
[00:51:44] <borodust> according to steam survey ~95% of PCs support it vs ~98% for SSE4.2
[00:51:54] <rtypo> damn
[00:52:04] <rtypo> that's why i'm the guy with the old laptop in the family
[00:52:24] <rtypo> so mine is older than 95% PCs
[00:52:27] <borodust> :D
[00:52:39] <rtypo> i also can't run godot 4 because my gpu has no vulkan support
[00:52:57] <rtypo> also... can't run android studio because too little ram
[00:53:01] <rtypo> etc. :)
[00:53:18] <borodust> well, 10yo PC is sure old
[00:53:39] <rtypo> i think my screen is even older
[00:53:47] <rtypo> i had a good one and it broke
[00:54:09] <rtypo> now i have a 1280 x 1024 one... lemmie see the year
[00:54:17] <borodust> ouch
[00:54:30] <rtypo> from 2006, haha!
[00:54:32] <borodust> don't breath on it jic
[00:55:04] <rtypo> yeah, i really have to upgrade these. thanks for reminding me
[00:55:26] <borodust> rtypo: btw, does your pc support opengl 4.1?

[00:57:32] * borodust mindblown
[00:57:36] <|3b|> ah, has a real gpu too, not just n integrated one
[00:57:45] <rtypo> yeah, i guess
[00:57:58] <rtypo> it's a gpu from 2010 as well
[00:58:15] <|3b|> though still going to be slow by today's standards :)
[00:58:30] <rtypo> absolutely
[00:58:36] <|3b|> though 4.6 is still a bit surprising
[00:58:37] <borodust> hmm, i see, nvidia just backported drivers for older gens
[00:58:57] <borodust> yeh, interesting 
[01:00:03] <|3b|> though i guess wikipedia lists 4xxM as dx12/gl4.5, so looks like 4.6 is plausible

[08:54:37] <borodust> like, previously, there were ppl with no OpenGL 3.0 support
[08:54:54] <borodust> i actually added support for OpenGL 2.1
[08:55:42] <borodust> but properly extending tech coverage takes time

[17:04:23] <dthompson> hey dto
[17:06:32] <dto> glad to hear of progress on your bundles. let me know if i can help test
[17:06:51] <dto> i'm listening to some "Witch House" style music
[17:08:44] *** Quits: ConstantDesc (~textual@cpc158823-hari22-2-0-cust72.20-2.cable.virginm.net) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[17:09:31] <dthompson> I know "house", but what does the "witch" subgenre sound like?
[17:09:53] <dto> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHAbRa7To-U&list=PLa-xBlyGSf9icvHkiiSyNi-PZmo0ljmjt  here's a classic album in the genre 
[17:10:16] <dto> slower tempo and trap-like beats, distorted voices, distant melodies
[17:11:02] <dto> the first track is probably a decent litmus test :) as for whether you like it
[17:11:55] <dto> i'm even working with a friend on producing a witch house influenced dance EP
[17:11:58] <dthompson> it's pretty cool
[17:12:32] <dthompson> it's a little too "dancy" for my tastes, but I like the slower tempo and ambience
[17:12:43] <dto> :)
[17:12:51] <dto> glad u enjoyed.
[17:13:12] <dto> yeah ambience and a sense of heavy mood are marks of the genre
[17:13:43] <dthompson> I think I'd like it more without the high synth giving that EDM feel
[17:14:14] <dthompson> but all the samples are cool
[17:14:15] <dto> hmm makes sense. 
[17:14:44] <dthompson> the end of the song actually seems to drop some of that out
[17:14:54] <dthompson> that's more my speed
[17:15:43] <dto> well who knows poke around the album playlist u might find other tracks u like.

[17:16:44] <dto> the vocals aren't on it yet, we're still writing the words etc. but the backing track is there. 
[17:17:04] <dthompson> sure
[17:17:46] <dto> okay one moment!
[17:18:43] <dto> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/44n9vdYV/freakstyle-X-32.mp3
[17:19:18] <dto> keep in mind this is a work in progress and not a finished track. there's gonna be some parts of the instrumentation strategically removed to make room for vocal lines later, and also some things might be added
[17:22:18] <dthompson> I'm in a band, I'm used to listening to unfinished tracks ;)
[17:22:34] <dthompson> dto: in exchange, here's a link to a bundle: https://files.dthompson.us/chickadee-bundle-test.tar.gz
[17:22:41] <dto> oK! one moment
[17:23:32] <dthompson> I built it on ubuntu 18.04 and ran it successfully on ubuntu 20.04.
[17:23:34] <dto> it works. i get a blender monkey head on a background. 
[17:23:38] <dthompson> YESSSSSSS
[17:23:43] <dto> no sound or movement 
[17:23:48] <dto> :)
[17:23:52] <dthompson> dto: it's a 3D render but no animation.
[17:24:01] <dto> ah i see
[17:24:10] <dto> cool tho, sounds like you were able to sort out the library issues!
[17:24:38] <dthompson> building on old ubuntu 18.04 makes the bundle much more likely to work on other machines
[17:24:55] <dthompson> and also not building on the machine I develop on helps uncover issues.
[17:25:02] <dto> that's a good strategy
[17:25:22] <dthompson> thanks for testing!
[17:25:24] <dto> i seem to remember you being in a band but not what kind of music it is
[17:25:27] <dto> hey you're welcome
[17:25:38] <dthompson> the track is cool
[17:25:45] <dto> hey thanks for listenin g;)
[17:25:50] <dthompson> neat baseline and additional flourishes
[17:26:11] <dthompson> yeah I play drums in a punk band that has been very bad at actually releasing music.
[17:26:17] <dthompson> but hopefully we'll have an ep out soon
[17:26:18] <dto> yeah! i layered 4 different classic synth orchestra hits to get the "burst" at the chorus
[17:26:23] <dthompson> I tracked drums for it years ago
[17:26:37] <dto> oh cool. yeah let me know what happens with the EP.
[17:27:29] <dthompson> I think it's going to emerge from the garbage bin onto bandcamp soon.
[17:27:50] <dto> awesome :)
[17:28:15] <dthompson> the main guy in the band is finishing it up. part of the problem was the limited availability of the person we recorded with. going to go somewhere else next time.
[17:28:29] <dto> ah i see. yeah that can be a problem... bottlenecks...
[17:30:05] <dthompson> I'd like to try making some digital music sometime. I even have an electronic drum set in the same room as my computer now and it has a midi outpout.
[17:30:06] <dthompson> output*
[17:30:29] <dto> oh cool. yeah give it a shot! i highly recommend https://lmms.io
[17:30:58] <dthompson> I fiddled around with that many years ago
[17:31:09] <dto> it's come a long way.
[17:31:40] <dto> oh let me know if you need Soundfonts and Gigasampler files. i have a reasonable starter collection although i'm trying to acquire more
[17:33:33] <dthompson> will do
[17:33:43] <dthompson> I'm pretty clueless about it all which I'd like to correct
[17:34:08] <dthompson> I know enough about music that I could probably make my own stuff for any games I make
[17:35:33] <dto> hey that's a great idea and definitely doable
[17:37:02] <dthompson> being able to track the drums from my drum set will be a big help
[17:37:21] <dthompson> we also have a digital piano here with a midi output but that's in a different room.
[17:37:52] <dto> i'd have to think about how that works with LMMS. because LMMS can get MIDI input for notes, but i'm not sure how you would map the drum hits to samples. i can ask on the lmms discord if you like!
[17:38:06] <dthompson> I'll figure out if I get into it
[17:38:10] <dto> ok
[17:38:19] <dthompson> my understanding is that most music that does midi has a way to do this
[17:39:04] *** Joins: ConstantDesc (~textual@cpc158823-hari22-2-0-cust72.20-2.cable.virginm.net)
[17:39:05] <dto> yeah i'm guessing there's a way to make it work.
[17:39:08] <dthompson> one thing people do with electric drum sets is hook them up to the computer to get much better samples than what is supplied on the drum module.
[17:39:34] <dto> what does your drum set send in terms of MIDI? are they fixed notes for each pad?
[17:39:43] <dthompson> I really don't know
[17:39:48] <dthompson> I've never used the midi output
[17:40:01] <dthompson> I just practice on it, but I'd like to get more into the details of what it is doing
[17:40:09] <dto> cool man keep me informed :)
[17:40:24] <dthompson> I'll need to buy some sort of interface first.
[17:41:49] <dto> oh yeah youll need midi ports. i recommend M-Audio brand interfaces, it's what i've used for ages, and all their products work great with GNU/Linux
[17:42:30] <dthompson> I've looked at maudio interfaces in the past when I was hoping to record acoustic drums from phone.
[17:42:51] <dthompson> I no longer have room to keep an acoustic kit setup so I have the electric
[17:43:22] <dthompson> I just looked at my drum module and it can do midi over usb!
[17:43:30] <dto> oh great.
[17:43:42] <dto> yeah my Axiom 49 does that. entirely midi powered
[17:43:44] <dto> i mean usb
[17:44:02] <dthompson> I just need a longer cable ;)
[17:45:37] <dto> well that's cool it sounds like you are on your way. i googled a bit for midi drum pads with lmms, it looked like there's a couple ways to do it.
[17:47:03] <dto> or i might be wrong. 
[17:54:40] <dthompson> I bet there's a way
[17:55:28] <dto> hmm. i think your best bet might be to use Gigedit to make a custom Gigasampler file that simply maps your samples to the right pads, and then load that kit into LMMS
[17:55:43] <dto> there seems to be no free soundfont editor. but gigedit is FOSS
[17:56:31] <dto> as a bonus you get velocity mapping capability i..e. crossfade between a "soft hit" and "hard hit" samples depending on how hard
[17:56:34] <dto> etc
[18:00:36] *** Joins: Posterdati (~posterdat@host-95-235-15-123.retail.telecomitalia.it)
[18:01:45] <dto> so on the one hand you have to use an external GUI to map the samples. not that different from using ZynAddSubFX within LMMS. but on the other hand you get to keep each drum kit as a reusable file that isn't trapped inside one LMMS song
[18:03:32] <dto> ok so you might need to use a live combo of Linuxsampler and Gigedit to interactively develop your drum kit, then save to .gig and load in LMMS.
[18:07:25] <dto> that actually doesn't sound like that bad of a solution, and it's FOSS

[20:53:35] <dthompson> dto: I hooked up my drum set to lmms. I don't really know how to use anything yet but when the connection is working.
[20:54:33] <dto> oh nice! yeah i will have to invite you over and show you the ropes here on the big screen. and i can help answer any questions u have in the interim. some things are counterintuitive but eventually everything made sense. it took a little while for me to really figure it out

[21:51:42] <dto> dthompson here's my setup :) https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/WW8qCtKJ/IMG_20210911_195152968.jpg
[21:53:53] <dthompson> big ol speakers
[21:58:58] <dthompson> it does seem like lmms may not be great for trying to record midi drums.
[21:59:14] <dthompson> hydrogen supports mapping drum pads to samples, though. so maybe I could do drums in that.
[22:00:56] <dthompson> dto: what midi controller is that?
[22:01:06] <dthompson> if I find myself getting more into this stuff I will want to buy one.
[22:01:57] <dto> it's M-Audio Axiom 49
[22:03:26] <dthompson> thanks
[22:04:28] <dto> you might be able to use Ardour to record MIDI  , while hearing it in realtime from Linuxsampler.
[22:04:33] <dto> then, playback to linuxsampler.
[22:04:50] <dto> hydrogen is cool tho, not sure if you can record midi sequences tho
[22:05:49] <mfiano> I know nothing about FOSS audio solutions, but I have been hearing a lot of good things about Bespoke lately. Might be worth checking out for those that know more than me :)
[22:06:28] <dthompson> dto: I'll need to go full JACK if I want to use ardour, I think
[22:06:48] <dthompson> lmms is nice because you don't need to
[22:07:50] <thrig> can't help you there, I don't know jack
[22:07:56] <dthompson> ;)

[23:22:41] <rtypo> borodust: no luck with intel sde so far
[23:24:02] <borodust> rtypo: i see, yeah, appimages are tricky
[23:24:06] <borodust> thanks for checking
[23:24:12] <rtypo> the closest i got was, it's spamming this: http://ix.io/3AaZ
[23:24:18] <rtypo> at a crazy rate
[23:24:41] <borodust> something definitely breaks
[23:24:51] <rtypo> had to run it with "-skip-int3", no idea what it means :D
[23:25:17] <rtypo> otherwise it says... 1 sec
[23:25:53] <rtypo> Process was trapped over int 3 [...] specify -skip-int3
[23:26:10] <rtypo> i also tried to run from mounted/extracted appimage, same result
[23:26:20] <borodust> ohh, that's interesting
[23:26:38] <borodust> sad
[23:27:05] <rtypo> this is the whole "int3" error: http://ix.io/3Ab0
[23:27:12] <dthompson> borodust: I have a new bundle if you feel like testing: https://files.dthompson.us/chickadee-bundle-test.tar.gz
[23:27:16] <rtypo> no idea what "knobs" are, lol
[23:27:56] <rtypo> so i guess that concludes it. now i need a new cpu :)
[23:28:19] <borodust> ;p
[23:28:35] <borodust> dthompson: i'll have a look
[23:33:57] *** Quits: thrig (~thrig@65.113.153.50) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:34:31] <rtypo> dthompson: oh, launch-game now has "cd" instead of "chdir", that gave an error last time
[23:34:41] <rtypo> now i get this error http://ix.io/3Ab6
[23:35:57] <rtypo> i have an older gpu from ~2010
[23:41:20] <borodust> actually, i'm having same error: https://gist.github.com/borodust/7350c47f269a8e977541163d81682391
[23:41:59] <borodust> > OpenGL core profile version string: 4.6.0 NVIDIA 470.63.01
[23:42:30] <dthompson> good to know! that's actually pretty good, since it means the program was able to load everything and just got hung up on shader that needs to handle more computer differences.
[23:42:38] <dthompson> thanks to you both
[23:42:56] <dthompson> I bet if I had used a basic 2d rendering as the example program it would have worked.
[23:43:42] <dthompson> I use cube map sampling for the skybox in the scene that would render if it wasn't broken
[23:44:02] <borodust> looks like you are using a function that's not supported in the shader lang version you specified
[23:44:10] <borodust> and provided as an extension
[23:44:28] <dthompson> it works on other machines without it
[23:45:02] <borodust> yeah, the only thing i can say is welcome to amazing world of GLSL compilers embedded into drivers ;p
[23:45:09] <dthompson> if you're willing, could you try adding "#extension GL_NV_shadow_samplers_cube : enable" to the top of the chickadee-bundle/share/chickadee/shaders/pbr-frag.glsl and run it again?
[23:45:16] <borodust> sure
[23:45:38] <dthompson> yeah but this is good stuff. the more machines I can collect data from the more reliable I can make this whole thing.
[23:46:31] <dthompson> I don't know if I've tested on a machine with an nvidia gpu yet until you both tried
[23:48:07] <borodust> result: https://imgur.com/JpmVt1c
[23:48:26] <rtypo> same. it's suzanne!
[23:50:05] <dthompson> borodust, rtypo: alright! at least it doesn't crash. the lighting is wrong, but hey it's progress.
[23:50:45] <borodust> true, glad to help :)
[23:51:01] <dthompson> skybox renders fine, at least.
[23:51:26] <dthompson> my jam entry is very unlikely to use 3d, so I'm not gonna worry too much about it.
[23:54:03] <dthompson> I'd like to get an macos build, as well, but I hate using macos...
[23:58:00] <borodust> i'm not even going to bother at this time ;p
[23:58:37] <borodust> with macos, that is
[23:59:17] <dthompson> yeah same
[23:59:21] <dthompson> maybe next jam
