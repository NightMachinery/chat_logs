[15:59:34] <hype> murthy It seems that there was a problem because Japanese was mixed in the SSID.
[16:00:07] <murthy> SSID of your wifi router or the Sonos?
[16:02:14] <hype> Of course, the SSID of the Wi-Fi router is alphabetic, but Japanese was mixed in the "iPhone name".
[16:03:21] <murthy> I guess even in that case it should be a problem
[16:03:41] <murthy> afaik they use utf-8 or something
[16:05:46] <hype> To enjoy music on Sonos Roam outdoors without a Wi-Fi environment, we need at least two iOS / iPad OS devices.

[16:10:09] <hype> jbwncster I go to a private house in the mountains. I bought Sonos Roam to listen to music together in an empty space in the mountains.

[16:11:58] <hype> murthy I have to connect one to the internet and use it like a Wi-Fi router and the other to play music.

[23:40:26] <murthy> artao: that twitch tv stream
[23:40:48] <artao> yes
[23:40:50] <murthy> was that a live stream or were you streaming a recorded one
[23:41:10] <artao> live stream to twitch, then edited for upload to youtube
[23:41:23] <artao> i had to cut out about an hour as well as fix a few areas where the video went black
[23:41:36] <louipc> redempt1on:  does that mean youre racist
[23:42:07] <murthy> artao: nice!
[23:42:31] <artao> it was largely for to work out kinks
[23:42:38] <artao> of which i had plenty
[23:43:01] <artao> i intend to live stream more often. ideally at least once a month if not more
[23:43:12] <artao> ideally ideally every weekend
[23:43:17] <artao> but we'll see how that goes
[23:43:28] <artao> i still have a few issues to work out, particularly involving cameras
[23:43:55] <artao> what i wanted to do for video didn't work, so what the video IS is moreso just what worked quick at the time
[23:44:36] <artao> however, setting my old 640x480 webcam directly on top of my plasma ball worked out really well and looks way way cool
[23:44:39] <artao> so there's that
[23:45:05] <artao> i WANT a camera on my equipment while playing
[23:45:40] <artao> i was trying to use my phone as a wireless webcam but couldn't get it to work
[23:45:46] <artao> i've gotten it to work in the past but IDR how
[23:45:48] <artao> D'OH
[23:46:14] <artao> at any rate murthy ... what did you think? how much of it didyou listen to?
[23:46:24] <artao> it changes A LOT over the course of the hour
[23:46:43] <redempt1on> No

[23:46:49] <redempt1on> I can't be racist.
[23:47:05] <murthy> artao: nice to know you will be doing it weekly or so
[23:47:14] <redempt1on> You couldn't handle a black woman, white boy.
[23:47:29] <murthy> artao: You need to inform people before hand so that they want to watch the stream
[23:47:59] <murthy> afaik here video is not an important thing as you are there for the musi

[23:48:51] <murthy> incase you want to use your mobile there is an ways you can do it. For example there is v4l module
[23:48:58] <murthy> v4l is video for linux
[23:49:30] <murthy> after that you can open the video stream with vlc and similar
[23:50:02] <murthy> artao: I only sampled your stream as I was little busy with work
[23:50:53] <murthy> but the moving display art was impressive, I didn't know you were good at making blender animations and stuff
[23:51:18] <murthy> Your music was like space trance or something

[23:53:30] <redempt1on> I"m a sound cloud rapper

[23:53:44] <artao> i came up with a couple other cool effects yesterday too
[23:54:33] <murthy> nice
[23:54:33] <artao> Ultimately i want to pipe the music into Touch Designer, cuz then the visuals can be music reactive
