[00:00:38] <extra_medium> Just curious, Debian stable users: I use stable, but there are a few packages I backport myself from testing or unstable. Pipewire is one example. Is this common, or do stable users stick with stable no matter what?
[00:01:23] <sney> it's fairly common
[00:01:51] <sney> stable-backports is used a lot as well, if you find packages are simple to backport yourself you might request that they be backported officially
[00:01:52] *** Joins: guiverc (~guiverc@ubuntu/member/guiverc)
[00:03:23] <extra_medium> Yeah, I used (still use) stable-backports it's where I learned I could backport my own package (though sometimes I fail miserably)

[00:16:50] <jelly> extra_medium, stable is an excellent platform.  Sometimes you need something extra.  Not always but sometimes.

[04:53:29] <graytron> debian 11 live standard installer has an issue where wifi works while installing the os, but after installation is complete wifi doesn't work anymore. debian 11 live xfce installer has an issue, where the installation fails after selection of keyboard layout with a message about "Failed to copy file from installation media. Retry?". funny
[04:54:27] <sney> the latter is probably the image getting mangled somehow while writing to the usb stick
[04:54:46] <sney> the former wifi issue should be an easy fix, what firmware file does dmesg say is missing?
[04:56:30] <graytron> sney: does live install media have some way to verify the image?

[04:57:19] <sney> the debian download page offers checksums, though mostly it's a question of making sure you don't use some iso-mangling program to write it, and that your usb drive isn't broken
[04:59:13] <graytron> sney: i don't have the system installed anymore, but the computer has an old atheros AR928X wifi, which uses open source firmware
[04:59:17] <graytron> or no firmware :)
[04:59:39] <sney> oh, ath9k. hrm that shouldn't need anything else, you're right
[04:59:46] <graytron> sney: i verified the checksum before "sudo cp image.iso /dev/sdb"
[05:00:05] <sney> maybe the wifi appeared to not work because it stayed in /etc/network/interfaces post-install so it wasn't available for the desktop widget

[15:14:29] <dems98> Hi, I have a problem with the installation of proprietary drivers for AMD Radeon R7 M360 on Debian Bullseye. When I run the installer, I get this error: error: Detected X Server version 'XServer 1.20.11_64a' is not supported. Supported versions are X.Org 6.9 or later, up to XServer 1.10 (default:v2:x86_64:lib32:XServer 1.20.11_64a:none:5.10.0-10-amd64:)

[15:16:47] <dems98> Can I install them somehow with this version of XServer or do I have to stick with open-source drivers (amdgpu)?
[15:17:04] <Khepra> dems98: amd proprietary drivers are built for ubuntu and ubuntu dependency versions. if there's such a mismatch, it's gonna require rebuilding all of it to match, which is hugenormous waste of time.
[15:17:30] <Khepra> dems98: what does proprietary haev that open source doesn't? taht amd variant of cuda whatwasit?
[15:17:44] *** Joins: chipox (~chipox@178.255.149.130)
[15:18:34] <Khepra> otherwise, if you want latest possible support for amdgpu, then you can install backported kernel, and maybe firmware from kernel.org (just the "amdgpu" dir, instead of debian packaged) -- but maybe even that's not necessary for your relatively old card

[15:19:16] <dems98> Khepra: I have noticed worse performance of open source drivers than proprietary drivers for Windows
[15:19:20] <Khepra> the biggest amdgpu support issue is mesa. latest mesa brings a lot of bugfixes that affect amdgpu
[15:19:43] <Khepra> dems98: opengl performance is terrible on linux and amd proprietary is _not_ gonna fix that.
[15:20:39] <Khepra> if this is for games, the sad fact is that for example windows version under proton in steam works _way_ better than native linux, for a number of games. directX11 is very well supported. unless vulkan, which is somewhat okay support on linux, but you're gonna need latest and debian is not cut out for latest.
[15:20:57] *** Joins: badsektor (~badsektor@user/badsektor)
[15:21:39] <Khepra> this is from personal experience. I play (performance demanding) games and for that I had to build mesa, libvulkan, and bring in kernel.org firmware and kernel because my gpu is shiny new and Stable doesn't have support for it.

[15:26:43] <Khepra> dems98: yes but, again, that's not going to be enough, you'll need mesa unless you're playing older games or yours aren't affected with certain bugs that latest mesa fixes

[15:31:05] <Khepra> dems98: you can check mesa changelogs and see if your games are affected: https://docs.mesa3d.org/relnotes.html ; mesa in stable is at 20.3.5, latest upstream and sid have 21.3.3 which made some games I play even playable, let alone glitchless
[15:33:34] <dems98> Khepra: I mostly play old games (like Valve ones) so maybe I don't need latest mesa. Anyway, thanks a lot :)

[22:34:09] <OpenBDSM> one last question then: I just installed linux mint and turns out that they provide their own apt that 'beats' (in terms of PATH) the regular apt binary's priority. Does debian do anything like that?
[22:34:22] <OpenBDSM> oh, maybe not last question
[22:34:54] <sney> debian only has 1 apt so I'm not sure what mint's thing even means
[22:35:17] <bob_x1> do I need to set up cyrillic font to a debian netinst in order to see cyrillic symbols ?
[22:35:18] <sney> this is the upstream debian distro, though, so there's no need to override stuff for derivative reasons

[22:35:49] <OpenBDSM> I got used to ubuntu, but I am currently stuck on older version (18.04) and ubuntu's management/devs/maintainers are being quite pushy towards snapd which I don't like at all. What's debian's stance on snapd topic?
[22:36:04] <sney> debian supports snapd but it is not installed by default in any debian releases
[22:36:07] <OpenBDSM> will it soon adopt ubuntu's behavior or not?
[22:36:15] <sney> will that change in the future? who knows, but it's not a priority
[22:36:37] <OpenBDSM> does debian support ubuntu's PPAs?
[22:36:45] <sney> not officially.
[22:37:08] <sney> if you *absolutely need* some ppa software it is sometimes possible to shoehorn it, but it's not recommended, instead you should rebuild the package from the debianized source

[22:40:01] <OpenBDSM> IMO usually people don't use PPAs when it's not absolutely necessary.

[22:41:28] <OpenBDSM> yeah, so I'm either bound to install older version of Debian (which I don't really want to), or will have to solve the problem somehow manually on bullseye
[22:42:52] <jmcnaught> which problem?
[22:43:17] <OpenBDSM> the unavailability of ansible-2.9
[22:43:50] <jmcnaught> buster-backports: 2.9.16+dfsg-1~bpo10+2
[22:43:57] <sney> installing it from oldstable on stable may be an option, and is much less likely to break apt / produce dependency hell than using a 3rd party repo would

[22:44:04] <jmcnaught> oh I see… it's not in bullseye-backports for some reason

[22:52:10] <OpenBDSM> no-no, go on, bugweiser
[22:52:16] <sney> bugweiser: your first line got cut off, "...The source of confusion is: rfm and tomreyn"
[22:53:05] <bugweiser> no, I copied the same thing twice (being the folk that already confirmed, which I mention in the hope that helps speed things along a bit :) )
[22:53:52] <sney> ok, but what is the issue
[22:53:55] <bugweiser> basically almost everything is incorrect in that manpage, but the thing that has the most of my attention is the SECOND example.
[22:54:55] <bugweiser> The encoded  option says the output file name has been  base64  encoded.   It  is  never  encoded  with  traditional  uuencoding.   This  is  a  GNU  extension.

[23:09:54] <qweYYYT> and I assume, that this image won't contain drivers?
[23:10:11] <qweYYYT> e.g. for nvidia
[23:10:12] <sney> it contains drivers, because in linux drivers are part of the kernel
[23:10:20] <sney> it does not contain non-free modules or firmware.
[23:10:21] <dvs> but not firmware
[23:10:47] <qweYYYT> so what if I wanna use firmware?
[23:10:54] <qweYYYT> i need nvidia drivers
[23:11:03] <sney> there is a link on that cdimage page that shows where to get the iso that includes non-free firmware
[23:11:04] <dvs> do you have WiFi?
[23:11:09] <qweYYYT> yes
[23:11:15] <qweYYYT> both wifii and ethernet
[23:11:25] <sney> for nvidia, you have to install the driver after installing the OS, it's packaged separately and needs to be compiled in the running OS
[23:11:44] <bugweiser> then you get a warning that your kernel no longer is pristine and you infected it with drm (seen it come by yesterday on ubuntu, for nvidea)
[23:11:47] <qweYYYT> so i'll have to add "contrib non-free" to source.list ?
[23:11:52] <qweYYYT> and then grab nvidia drivers?

[23:12:54] <sney> you will get non-free firmware but for nvidia, you have to install the driver after installing the OS, it's packaged separately and needs to be compiled in the running OS

[23:13:33] <dpkg> Where possible, Nvidia graphic processing units are supported using the open source <nouveau> driver on Debian systems by default.

[23:13:47] <sney> non-free installer does not have the nvidia driver on it.
[23:14:01] <qweYYYT> ohh, i see

[23:14:46] <sney> non-free installer *will* make your wifi more likely to work out of the box, so you may want it for that reason.
[23:15:26] <qweYYYT> so without non-free installer, i'll be able to install Debian via Ethernet, and then i'll have to install wifii drivers manually?
[23:15:30] <sney> OpenBDSM: maybe throw in a shift? idk I always use the traditional installer
[23:15:59] <sney> qweYYYT: basically
[23:16:10] <OpenBDSM> sney, doesn't help
[23:16:41] <qweYYYT> so it seems that non-free installer is better? It's easier to fully install Debian with all/most required drivers?
[23:16:57] <jhutchins> There are distros that optionally include non-free drivers and firmware.
[23:17:01] <sney> qweYYYT: if you are going to use wifi, you may as well start from the non-free installer.
[23:17:12] <OpenBDSM> the installer also failed to configure the network, judging by what I saw on the screen - it only tried to configure (non-connected) ethernet interface. Does it NOT support Wi-Fi?
[23:17:29] <jhutchins> There are also wifi chipsets that do not require non-free drivers or firmware.
[23:17:33] <Blondie101010> not if the driver is non free, as mentioned
[23:17:33] <qweYYYT> I want to have wifii on my machine, but I dont need it particularry during the installation process (i can use ethernet)
[23:17:39] <qweYYYT> but i want to use wifii at some point later
[23:17:56] <Blondie101010> OpenBDSM:  for simplicity, just plug an Ethernet cable and use the regular installer
[23:17:57] <sney> OpenBDSM: if you didn't use the non-free iso, like we're currently explaining to qweYYYT, your installer may be lacking firmware needed for the wifi driver to load
[23:18:17] <OpenBDSM> I used 'netinstall' iso
[23:18:29] <sney> there are basically 0 wifi adapters that work without non-free anymore
[23:18:29] <Blondie101010> does it go online?
[23:18:58] <OpenBDSM> no, it acts as if Wi-Fi doesn't exist
[23:19:02] <sney> OpenBDSM: the non-free iso would have a filename like firmware-11.2-amd64-netinst.iso
[23:19:03] <OpenBDSM> well, that sucks
[23:19:08] <qweYYYT> so i should use non-free installer then, right?
[23:19:18] <Blondie101010> OpenBDSM:  you don't have an Ethernet port?

[23:29:45] <sney> optimus was designed for windows. on linux it can be a huge mess. but it's been better in the past couple years.
[23:29:52] <OpenBDSM> if your notebook has 2 GPUs (the one from CPU and 1 discrete) and if discrete is 'nvidia' - it's probably 'optimus'

[23:30:24] <qweYYYT> and debian asks me if partition is primary or logical - it does not matter right? I can create all primary?
[23:30:49] <sney> as long as you aren't going to use more than the maximum # of partitions, it does not matter
[23:31:10] <sney> also, make sure you *disable* windows fast-boot as it will break both debian and windows if you leave it enabled
[23:31:11] <qweYYYT> and how can i check what's the maximum no of partitions?

[23:33:00] <qweYYYT> GPT
[23:33:13] <sney> sometimes, and in #debian we don't know how old your computer is, anything post-2010 or so will install the same
[23:33:37] <sney> I would think that the installer asking you for primary/logical would only happen if it was mbr? but I'm not sure.
[23:33:38] <OpenBDSM> wifi passphrase is not wildcarded
[23:34:14] <qweYYYT> i tried running it on virtual machine and asked for primary/logical
[23:34:34] <qweYYYT> I just wanna preinstall it on virtual machine before performing an installation on my laptop
[23:34:42] <bugweiser> I think you check in your bios or 'bios' :)
[23:34:44] <qweYYYT> 'cos the paritioning might be a little tricky
[23:34:44] <sney> your vm was probably booted in bios mode, efi is still rare there
[23:35:15] <bugweiser> and you can often switch back your 'bios' to behave more like bios and use mbr instead of gpt
[23:35:32] <OpenBDSM> 'Configure network' step asks me for Domain name. Where will it save that to? /etc/resolv.conf as 'search' option?
[23:35:33] <qweYYYT> I think i want gpt, since i've already got more than 4 partitions
[23:35:58] <bugweiser> mbr offers 4 'primary' partitions
[23:36:03] <sney> your system disk is most likely gpt
[23:36:04] <OpenBDSM> qweYYYT, always go with GPT, forget MBR. Even if you have MBR - it's worth to just fix it already
[23:36:10] <bugweiser> the vbr's on these can offer more parttions depending on os/bootcode
[23:36:23] <sney> OpenBDSM: iirc the domain name dialog says this, but domain only matters if your network considers it, otherwise you can leave it blank

[23:36:55] <qweYYYT> ok, so now I want to dual boot with Windows. I already have some partitions for Windows (boot loader, windows system, some additional ntfs partition i want to cross-mount) and free space
[23:37:09] <qweYYYT> now i need to use that free space to create partitions for debian, right?
[23:37:44] <sney> yes, the installer will show any unpartitioned space as free
[23:38:04] <qweYYYT> ok, I want to do full disk encryption, so I need at least 2 partitions

[23:41:11] <qweYYYT> like without swap partition I wont be able to suspend - or if i suspend then bad stuff may happen?
[23:41:27] <sney> without swap space, your computer would not be able to suspend to *disk*
[23:41:38] <sney> it can still suspend to memory aka sleep
[23:41:49] <qweYYYT> but this "suspend" button will still be available in gui, right?
[23:41:49] <OpenBDSM> the installer is going with a poor logic regarding my languages/country/time zone

[23:42:36] *** Joins: zemzem (~zem@user/zemzem)

[23:48:33] <jmcnaught> You can manually adjust what guided partitioning wants to do before it makes changes.
[23:49:43] <bugweiser> qweYYYT: if you need/want hibernation, then it seems you need to be very carefull with creating swapspace..
[23:50:03] <OpenBDSM> bugweiser, explain, please?
[23:50:12] <bugweiser> i'm told linux can't hibernate on multiple swap files (you can have only one swap-location), but worse..
[23:50:28] <qweYYYT> bugweiser I dont need hibernation
[23:50:33] <bugweiser> they say that: a+b=c  therefor c must fit into a
[23:50:45] <qweYYYT> jmcnaught I dont see this option
[23:50:47] <bugweiser> where a=swap-space, b=physical and c= total system ram
[23:50:53] <qweYYYT> i see dm-crypt only
[23:51:03] <bugweiser> (and if i'm incorrect, please someone correct me, please !)
[23:51:07] <sney> hibernate is where the system state is saved to disk, and then the system shuts down. when you turn the computer on, it boots from that saved state. it also doesn't work with secure boot
[23:51:08] <OpenBDSM> what's included in 'standard system utilities'?
[23:51:23] <sney> most people don't use hibernate anymore anyway, since power management makes s2ram pretty good
[23:51:45] <bugweiser> sney, but it really is true? your entire ram must fit into free swapspace for hibernation in linux ?

[23:54:49] <jmcnaught> Yeah guided partitioning might be only for when you use a whole drive, but it does know how to configure FDE so only one password is required at boot.
[23:54:51] <sney> if your swap partition is 16GB, and your ram is 32GB, but you want to make sure your system only used 16GB so it can fit in swap for hibernate, then remove 16GB and sell it on ebay ;)
[23:54:52] <qweYYYT> OpenBDSM sometimes they does, Some sensitive data may be leaked to /var/ other to /swap
[23:55:03] <qweYYYT> *they do
[23:55:13] <jhutchins>  /tmp for that matter.
[23:55:22] <qweYYYT> yeah, forgot about /tmp
[23:55:54] <qweYYYT> so may idea is to: /boot  as unencrypted, / - as encrypted
[23:55:59] <sney> deciding what to encrypt depends on threat model. this laptop has everything encrypted, including /boot, if some stranger or malicious person got their hands on it they can't even tell what OS it has other than it uses grub
[23:55:59] <qweYYYT> and create swapfile inside /
[23:56:05] <jmcnaught> Although https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/ch06s03.en.html#di-partition does say at 6.3.4 "First you will be given the opportunity to automatically partition either an entire drive, or available free space on a drive. This is also called “guided” partitioning."

[23:58:33] <sney> the whole discussion is nonsense. if you want hibernate, make your swap on disk big enough for all of your ram. if you don't, then don't.
[23:58:46] <bugweiser> you can't even write a script that does swapon on a file you created hibernate which has slightly more than your physical ram, and execute that prior to the hibernation sequence..
[23:58:51] <sney> and with secure boot limitations, hibernate itself will probably be obsolete soon
