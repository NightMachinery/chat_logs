[13:25:16] <river> what does the . do?
[13:25:24] <dsc_> no idea
[13:25:25] <dsc_> :D
[13:25:48] <dsc_> but I suppose it confuses the browser and the site does a Set-Cookie

[13:26:42] <mockturtle> [ Why does putting a dot after the URL remove login information? ] - superuser.com
[13:26:53] <epilys> you can even get around some blocking softwares if you append dots
[13:27:47] <dsc_> nice
[13:27:52] <dsc_> lets keep this trick a secret then
[13:27:57] <dsc_> the dot is too strong
[13:28:01] <epilys> interesting, my letsencrypt cert doesn't cover the trailing dot
[13:28:22] <epilys> ah no, apache is just confused over which site to serve (I serve multiple virtual hosts)
[13:28:42] <epilys> wait I'm confused
[13:28:51] <wink> people who write zone files know this trick
[13:29:37] <wink> who never wanted to configure foo.example.org but instead made foo.example.org.example.org shall throw the first stone
[13:33:04] <EdwardIII> haha just like quoting things in bash, you end up writing everything in full and putting a . at the end out of habit eventually

[17:56:00] <hodbogi> These are pretty cool though
[17:56:42] <epilys> vertical line?
[17:57:32] <hodbogi> yeah. With many compression algorithms vertical lines compress a lot easier, so you can dither using vertical lines that span multiple rows, which vastly decreases image size
[17:58:27] <chancee1> ha. til. any reason why vertical and not horizontal?
[17:58:39] <hodbogi> The trick has been used for many years, even back in the days of 8 and 16 bit video game consoles to fit images into tiny catridges.
[18:01:41] <hodbogi> No idea. I always considered compression to be black magic
[18:02:09] <hodbogi> I would say it's highly dependent on the compression algorithm

[20:14:22] <mindriot> "if i could turn back time.. to the good dope dayz.."
[20:14:54] <hodbogi> I had never seen anyone with any asian ethnicity in any form and there Iw as coming into an airport that on that particular day at least Was PACKED with just that.
[20:14:58] <mindriot> frisco as bad as l.a. i support, with the homeless, trannies and street urchins
[20:15:02] <hodbogi> it was like a holy shit moment
[20:15:14] <mindriot> oakland is chinatown
[20:15:22] <mindriot> at least when i visited 2 decades back
[20:15:39] <mindriot> theres diversity, but then there mass asians
[20:15:48] <technomancy> now SF is extremely diverse. if you go to a coffee shop you will overhear people pitching their python startups AND scala startups.
[20:15:49] <hodbogi> I mean I didn't really care but it's so weird when you're from Mainme because outside of the universities it's like 99.999999999% caucasian.
[20:16:19] <companion_cube> technomancy: :D
[20:16:30] <hodbogi> we're seeing a lot more diversity now though as our population rises with outsiders

[20:18:08] <hodbogi> They're nice to, these are like 100+ foot long yachts, he does all of the fiberglass coating on them and things and polishes them all shiny like and stuff. It's neat work
[20:18:28] <hodbogi> I could never afford a boat like that
[20:19:06] <hodbogi> technomancy: yeah. I bet its even more so now than it was in the 90s
[20:20:07] <hodbogi> the other thing that's super weird is that we like our personal space, a lot, and when I go out of state people stand in lines to get things shoulder to shoulder front to back and it's kind of annoying.

[20:21:33] <hodbogi> we just had a huge population incline from out of state due to covid, and I went to the fair the other day to check it out, and everyone was basically hugging distance from eachother in lines and it was like, wtf, chillout and let me breathe without having to smell your bo wtf.

[20:23:14] <mindriot> just get circlular, flail about and wait for people to join in
[20:23:15] <hodbogi> What about country westerns
[20:23:35] <mindriot> so, western is modern?
[20:23:58] <hodbogi> I like country that's 70s or older. Anything 80s or newer is to weird for me
[20:24:51] <mindriot> country-rock crossover
[20:24:52] <mindriot> and women
[20:25:08] <hodbogi> I like rock, I just don't like it in country
[20:25:15] <hodbogi> which is why that 80s cutoff is there for me
[20:25:28] <hodbogi> I like it to be more folky

[20:26:52] <hodbogi> classic rock and 90s grunge, so forth
[20:27:03] <mindriot> likewise
[20:28:08] <hodbogi> I'm not really into rap but there are some nostalgic connections like early Gorillaz was kind of neat, but it was also a very different kind of rap. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it though.

[22:08:15] <badtuple> Yeah, that guy's absolutely nuts. Unfortunately alot of the intersection of tech and art doesn't come with articles since the art/generations are thought to speak for themselves. Contrasted with tech-for-tech stuff I mean.

[22:09:16] <badtuple> I just meant for procedural generation in general, not him in particular.
