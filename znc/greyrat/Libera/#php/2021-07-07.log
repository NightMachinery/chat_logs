[21:04:15] <stenno> ash_worksi: i found this by googling 'php convert base'
[21:04:39] <stenno> sometimes its helpful to google your question before asking
[21:04:46] <stenno> the answer might be right around the corner
[21:05:23] <ash_worksi> stenno: I am not sure how to use this to answer my question; I mean given a range of (a b c) can I convert 4 to 'aa' ?
[21:05:46] <stenno> dunno what you mean with range of (a b c)
[21:05:59] <stenno> i thought you wanted to convert a number to another base
[21:06:02] *** Server sets mode: +Ccnrtzf ##please-register
[21:06:12] <stenno> dunno how '4' relates to 'aa'
[21:06:46] <ash_worksi> stenno: that is, if you count like: a, b, c, aa, ab, ac, ba, bb, bc, ca, cb, cc, aaa, aab, aac, aba, ...
[21:07:41] <ash_worksi> if there's a better word for this than converting a base it would help me greatly to know it
[21:08:02] <stenno> that is not a base, thats a made-up numbering system
[21:08:05] <stenno> in this case its base-3
[21:08:19] <stenno> base-3 with the numbers replaced with letters
[21:08:41] <stenno> so convert your number to base-3 and then replace the numbers with the respective letters
[21:10:04] <ash_worksi> interesting
[21:14:02] <ash_worksi> stenno: I get `false` using all printable chars in 0,255 ascii range when attempting base_convert($n,10,95);
[21:14:30] <Byteflux> you should be converting from base 10 to base 3... not base 95
[21:14:31] <stenno> read the doc
[21:14:36] <da_wunder> hmm, this might also help - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7664121/php-converting-number-to-alphabet-and-vice-versa
[21:14:41] <stenno> Both from_base and to_base have to be between 2 and 36, inclusive.
[21:15:21] <Byteflux> and then when you have the base-3 result, you can convert the numbers to letters

[21:17:16] <ash_worksi> stenno: again, I was hoping to avoid a loop to perform the math op
[21:17:51] <ash_worksi> if that's impossible, I understand, I just thought someone smarter than I might know of a way
[21:17:55] <da_wunder> do you know the limits of those alpha strings?
[21:18:13] <ash_worksi> da_wunder: what is "those"?
[21:18:29] <stenno> php is really bad when it comes to not using loops
[21:18:47] <ash_worksi> stenno: I just thought there might be a way mathematically
[21:18:52] <stenno> there is
[21:19:01] <da_wunder> ash_worksi: eg. a to cccccccccccccc <- is that the max range ?
[21:19:58] <stenno> but we apparently talk about base-95 here
[21:20:36] <da_wunder> just thinking about using static file where you generate that range _once_ and cache it and then just use it - brute but should work
[21:21:05] <ash_worksi> da_wunder: I don't have a max range in that case no, but I wouldn't imagine it to exceed str_repeat(" ", 26)

[21:22:04] <stenno> maybe juse use base36 instead?
[21:22:11] <stenno> does it have to be base-85?
[21:22:14] <stenno> 95
[21:23:13] <stenno> this is the general algorithm https://www.mathwarehouse.com/non-decimal-bases/how-to-convert-from-base-10-to-other-bases.php
[21:23:17] <ash_worksi> stenno: that was the goal really
[21:23:18] <stenno> sounds like a loop for me
[21:23:46] <Byteflux> is it base 95 though? that pattern looks like base 3 with letters instead of numbers. maybe im missing something >_>
[21:24:31] <stenno> Byteflux: i think they just chose a crappy example
[21:25:03] <stenno> they stated that they use base_convert with 95, not with 3
[21:25:15] <stenno> so i assume its base-95 and not base-3 like in their initial example
[21:25:42] <Byteflux> if it's base 95 then why would 'aa' come after 'c'?
[21:25:48] <stenno> Byteflux: i think they just chose a crappy example
[21:26:01] <stenno> forget their example, it was misleading
[21:26:06] <stenno> and persists to mislead you
[21:27:12] <Byteflux> i'm kinda leaning towards 95 as the to_base being the misleading/broken thing :P
[21:27:21] <stenno> yep
[21:27:31] <stenno> its about base-95
[21:27:33] <stenno> forget base-3

[21:28:15] <stenno>  stenno | Both from_base and to_base have to be between 2 and 36, inclusive.
[21:28:16] <Byteflux> specifying 95 was probably the mistake
[21:28:23] <stenno> no, i edon't think so
[21:28:29] <stenno> ash_worksi | stenno: then that doesn't work for my use-case
[21:30:00] <Byteflux> they should clarify, but if we assume the example is correct, then it can't be anything other than base-3, yes?
[21:30:06] <stenno> yes
[21:30:13] <stenno> but the example was probably not correct
[21:30:25] <stenno> what they actually wanted was base-95 all along
[21:31:17] <Byteflux> possibly that is the case, since they did mention an ascii range
[21:31:30] <ash_worksi> the example was not correct, I was just trying to explain what I was trying to do; I started with "arbitrary base" in my initial question
[21:31:50] <stenno> so it has to be a loop following above algorithm
[21:31:53] <Byteflux> gotcha, so you want to specify a base and use a range of ascii characters for it

[21:35:00] <stenno> it would be 95! permutations
[21:35:09] <da_wunder> also if the input is number - you could use for loop there and then cache that - and next time if number is lower than in your cache use that one or if greater run that loop again and replace that cache
[21:35:33] <ash_worksi> da_wunder: that is a neat idea
[21:35:50] <stenno> what is the specific reason you need to encode your number like that?
[21:35:51] <ash_worksi> stenno: okay, I thought it was a long shot to not use loops anyway
[21:35:55] <stenno> is it really neccessary?

[21:36:21] <stenno> please don't tell me you want to shave off a byte
[21:36:43] <da_wunder> another question is - are those for loops a real speed issue?
[21:36:44] <ash_worksi> it was really a thought experiment on enumerating all possible strings in a given charset
[21:36:48] <stenno> that wouldu be micro-optimization
[21:36:53] <stenno> ah
[21:37:02] <stenno> ash_worksi: the topic for that is called 'string permutations'
[21:37:08] <ash_worksi> stenno: neat!
[21:38:35] <da_wunder> and for that caching idea - if that number is greater than in your cache - you could just calculate the rest from that cached value, so that you don't do same stuff multiple times
[21:38:38] <stenno> https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Permutation.html
[21:39:44] <stenno> the number of permutations is the binomial coefficient
[21:40:05] <stenno> man pascal triangle shows up everywhere
[21:40:19] <stenno> its n over k, right
[21:40:33] <stenno> oh no, not quite
[21:43:27] <Rockwood> stenno, hi
[21:43:37] <ash_worksi> stenno: the thing that got me interested was after making a convert() function and dropping in all printable chars as a range, I got `9*!` for "10,000"; then I took the log(10000,95) and got 2.0225... which kind of resembled "2 characters and change" to me, so I thought it might be possible
[21:44:12] <ash_worksi> stenno: then I realized I am far to mathematically inept to come up with how that might work and deferred to IRC
[21:45:22] <stenno> the log will give you the number of characters
[21:45:27] <stenno> but not which characters
[21:46:08] <stenno> log of base x will give you the number of characters in the specific base
[21:46:40] <stenno> so log(15,10) will give you 2, and log(15,2) will give you 4

[21:52:41] <ash_worksi> but I dunno
[21:54:49] <stenno> but array_reduce is just a sensible alternative to a loop construct, under the hood it will be a loop anyway
[21:55:14] <ash_worksi> like if you have a charset as an array, then basically you just need to convert a number to an arrat of indecies right? In which case, I would imagine you could split it at some number of bits and just convert those to their indexes... is what I am imagining
[21:55:27] <stenno> yeah it will be possible with array_reduce keeping the reminder
