[04:59:26] <SomeoneWithALGPL> But anyway, there is a library licensed under LGPL with some useful code
[04:59:26] <SomeoneWithALGPL> The thing is, due to the way I want to use this code, I cannot use the code for my target application as it is not a library and is going to be under X11 license and not GPL/LGPL
[04:59:27] <SomeoneWithALGPL> My current idea is to study the code and sort of re-write/make my own implementation of it
[04:59:27] <SomeoneWithALGPL> My question is: Is this in the scope of LGPL (studying a library to create your own version), if so, what terms do I have to follow

[05:13:53] <Noisytoot> SomeoneWithALGPL, I think studying the source code and copying it may make it a derivative work, but you shouldn't need to do that unless you want to take away your user's freedoms
[05:14:53] <Noisytoot> The LGPL does not require derivatives to be libraries, and can be used for non-libraries, but it is designed for libraries
[05:17:06] <DiffieHellman> I myself would not use LGPL for libraries unless there is an existing developed proprietary library already. The LGPL allows people to use your libraries with proprietary software which really isn't a benefit.
[05:17:16] <Noisytoot> SomeoneWithALGPL, Depending on whether you are statically or dynamically linking, the LGPL has different requirements: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#LGPLStaticVsDynamic
[05:17:40] <DiffieHellman> Even then, once the chance has come, I'd make sure to relicense future versions under the GPL

[06:44:16] <M6piz7wk[m]> hugging great
[06:44:27] <M6piz7wk[m]> just when i though systemd can't get any worse
[06:44:28] <M6piz7wk[m]> someone makes it in C#
[06:44:43] <Armand> My bunnies are on Twitch, with their own account. :D
[06:44:54] <M6piz7wk[m]> rachelfish: your friend is hitler and beyond
[06:45:00] <rachelfish> LMAO
[06:45:01] <DiffieHellman> OpenRC replaces systemd, so there's no need for a replacement
[06:45:10] <Armand> "Need" ?
[06:45:20] <DiffieHellman> C# is the worst possible language to use, as mono doesn't work properly
[06:45:56] <Noisytoot> Is it possible to view twitch without nonfree software?
[06:45:58] * M6piz7wk[m] is on GNU Shepard and he likes the way it herds his GNUs
[06:46:09] <Noisytoot> *shepherd
[06:46:14] <Armand> Noisytoot: Never paid any attention to that.
[06:46:24] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: no shit! Who even though that making proprietary af language would be a great idea
[06:46:33] <M6piz7wk[m]> and even the efficiency is painful
[06:46:51] <M6piz7wk[m]> Noisytoot: close enough
[06:46:54] <Noisytoot> mono is free software (I think .NET core is also)
[06:47:03] <M6piz7wk[m]> boooo C#
[06:47:03] <DiffieHellman> Noisytoot: Yes, as youtube-dl supports twitch for viewing streams
[06:47:08] <Armand> I can watch a Twitch stream on Linux, so that's all I care about.
[06:47:12] <rachelfish> Noisytoot: depends on your definition of nonfree. I only install FOSS software on my computer, I am using firefox, but I allow twitch to run javascript in my browser
[06:47:21] <M6piz7wk[m]> use python if you need a scripting language that has a egoist complex to call itself a programming langauge
[06:47:30] <M6piz7wk[m]> that at least has some efficiency 
[06:47:40] <DiffieHellman> rachelfish: That's nonfree software in JavaScript form, so you're slipping on your freedom
[06:47:40] <Armand> Ohh.. that troll-bot is still here.
[06:47:41] <M6piz7wk[m]> well rather not as painful inefficiency 
[06:47:51] <Noisytoot> rachelfish, Nonfree JavaScript is still nonfree
[06:47:54] <DiffieHellman> There's no point using twitch online when youtube-dl supports twitch really/
[06:48:01] <rachelfish> it's sandboxed in my browser though
[06:48:02] <M6piz7wk[m]> i am not troll i am in pain from reading the words "systemd in C#"
[06:48:18] <Noisytoot> That doesn't make it free
[06:48:31] <DiffieHellman> rachelfish: Even if it's sandboxed it's still proprietary malware.
[06:48:34] <Noisytoot> Just as Windows is still nonfree even if you run it in a VM
[06:48:51] <DiffieHellman> I wouldn't trust JavaScript sandboxes at all anyway.

[06:53:15] <DiffieHellman> The only drawback with icecast for video is seemingly that you need to be able to unicast to all watchers, which probably has more bandwidth than you have. 
[06:53:49] <M6piz7wk[m]> Noisytoot: nothing mentioning **live** streaming 
[06:53:55] <M6piz7wk[m]> just video streaming from torrent i pressume
[06:54:02] <DiffieHellman> If multicast worked between AS's, that would eliminate that issue.

[06:57:32] <M6piz7wk[m]> ye looks cool
[06:57:42] <DiffieHellman> Sure the other end may be libre, but if you can only access it remotely and someone else controls it, it's not libre by definition.
[06:58:00] <Noisytoot> DiffieHellman, It's libre but SaaSS
[06:58:17] <Noisytoot> You could host your own server and it would not be SaaSS
[06:58:23] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: not if you run the server on your server
[06:58:37] <DiffieHellman> M6piz7wk[m]: That's not service as a software substitute then.
[06:58:41] <M6piz7wk[m]> which is what i want to do bcs i want portable device for stuff with power on demand
[06:59:42] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: nope just server and client that plays games
[06:59:59] <M6piz7wk[m]> but then lot of games are still proprietary so on backburner 
[07:00:07] <M6piz7wk[m]> force FSF to do something about that i need more mindustries
[07:00:12] <M6piz7wk[m]> ... and less java
[07:00:17] <Noisytoot> mindustry is free
[07:00:21] <Noisytoot> what can the FSF do about it?
[07:00:26] <M6piz7wk[m]> but java
[07:00:37] <Noisytoot> what can the FSF do about that?
[07:00:39] <M6piz7wk[m]> Noisytoot: not being so incompetent in that area would be a great start
[07:01:00] <Noisytoot> free java implementations exist
[07:01:18] <M6piz7wk[m]> idc i hate java
[07:01:44] <Noisytoot> Yes, but the FSF won't do anything about it if it's free
[07:02:02] <Noisytoot> It's the Free Software Foundation, not the Non-Java Software Foundation
[07:02:02] <M6piz7wk[m]> second making some libre game competetions would be amazing

[08:10:03] <jxself> I can think of a time where a bunch of members organized and wrote a letter to the board that got a lot of attention...

[13:00:19] <leah> i have a bunch of source files under GPLv3-or-later
[13:00:36] <leah> is it legal to mix GPLv3-only code with GPLv3-or-later
[13:00:51] <DiffieHellman> Why would it not be?
[13:01:08] <leah> and, hypothetically, would it be OK for a copyright holder of a given file to re-license *their* parts of the file under v3-only instead of v3-or-later?
[13:01:19] <leah> (while leaving other people's contributions v3-or-later, if that were the case)
[13:01:46] <leah> i also have the same question, but for FDL1.3-or-later and FDL1.3-only
[13:02:57] <leah> DiffieHellman: because i need to clarify this. i know that changing from one license to another entirely different one is more challenging thuogh
[13:03:14] <leah> for instance, changing from gplv2 to gplv3 and vice versa is legally challenging in lots of cases
[13:03:47] <leah> due to these licenses being incompatible (v2+ can be converted to v3, but v3 cannot be converted back to v2, without the copyright holder's consent)
[13:04:10] *** Joins: CaCode (~CaCode@user/cacode)
[13:04:15] <DiffieHellman> If you change the license, I believe the last copy of the authors code before any further changes can be taken under the original GPL-or-later license (as the GPLv3 does note that widthdrawing the license is only allowed on infringement).
[13:04:35] <leah> yes, that's fine
[13:04:47] <leah> and i then spend 15 years working on my version
[13:04:57] <leah> feel free to fork a version from 15 years ago ;)
[13:06:38] <DiffieHellman> I would not recommend changing from or-later to only when the rest are or-later, as the other authors might decide not to accept your further commits.

[13:07:12] <leah> well, that's true if you're not the leader of said project
[13:07:24] <leah> i wouldn't bother with this on someone elses project
[13:09:32] <leah> the other practicality might also occur: they will want to submit further changes under v3-or-later
[13:09:44] <DiffieHellman> Technically you can do it, but I would strongly recommend against it, as there's no reason not the have the or-later and that would just hurt integration with software under newer GPL versions (i.e. GPLv4).
[13:13:34] <leah> GPLv4 is specifically what i'm scared about
[13:14:22] <leah> i expressed concern about it earlier this year, with all the stuff that happened. and something tells me i'm still right to take precautions. i fear the remote possibility of the fsf being infiltrated in the future
[13:14:33] <DiffieHellman> How so? rms is the head of the FSF and he won't allow the GPLv4 to be less free.
[13:16:09] <DiffieHellman> The FSF will no longer be the FSF without rms at the head.
[13:16:24] <leah> exactly. and RMS is very old
[13:17:33] <leah> so it might not be him doing it
[13:17:51] <leah> another possibility is... good intentions but a bad set of decisions, leading to a worse license
[13:18:29] <DiffieHellman> Also, the GPL does note specifically; "Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.", so if the "GPLv4" was a nonfree license, or the changes didn't address new issues or concerns, you could reject such document.
[13:18:32] <leah> i feel like v3 is a decent license and lately i've been contemplating doing v3-only. but i'm researching the legalities/practicalities of it, in a project with multiple contributors
[13:18:56] <leah> so

[13:19:14] <leah> do you sign a contract that says you automatically agree to any future changes to that contract in the future
[13:19:36] <leah> no, you do not. because a future version of it could say you have to lick your elbow or pay a fine
[13:20:14] <DiffieHellman> Yes, provided that such contract has concrete terms that ensure that the allowed future changes are limited.
[13:21:05] <DiffieHellman> Such "lick your elbow" clause is not "similar in spirit", so such clause is invalid.
[13:23:17] <DiffieHellman> Anyway, rms is very powerful, he's not going anywhere soon. If after 40 years, the FSF is no longer for free software, go ahead and change that license to only.
[13:24:06] <leah> that's an odd way to think about rms. i don't think of free software people as powerful, just wise. their ideas hold water and they convince people (including myself), and people willingly agree to carry out their agenda
[13:24:10] <leah> that's influence, not power
[13:24:23] <leah> rms himself has even spoke of the distinction, saying that he prefers to have influence, not power
[13:24:38] <leah> https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/freedom-or-power.en.html
[13:25:02] <DiffieHellman> I meant "powerful" as "overflowing with freedom".
[13:25:11] <leah> DiffieHellman: i'll ask craigt when he comes online
[13:28:39] <DiffieHellman> leah: Ah yeah, you can also declare a proxy that can decide which future versions of the GPL can be used. So I guess you can keep the or-later, but declare a proxy that can decide if withdrawing the or-later permission is needed in the future. 
[13:30:03] <leah> i'd rather play it safe now

[21:31:01] <Kaiod> <hiya> "Kaiod: You basically support FSF" <- I think there should be something more, there should be a student council of Libreplanet, formed by students associated with FSF
[21:31:43] <ggoes> Kaiod: we've had something like that in the past and would love to get something similar set up again
[21:32:27] <ggoes> just a matter of finding interested students and doing enough outreach
[21:34:06] <Kaiod> I'm a student and I'm interested, now it would just be mobilizing and organizing/officializing it 
[21:34:56] <Kaiod> The FSF already sends monthly emails, it could invite students interested in participating by email
[21:35:12] <ggoes> Kaiod: would you mind writing campaigns@fsf.org with some of your early thoughts / info? it's easier for us to stay on top of that way
