[15:20:33] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[15:20:56] <gahr> hi flatcap :)
[15:28:15] <gahr> would you change alias_to_addrlist to append to the addrlist param ? So you could avoid the temporaries + mutt_addrlist_copy
[15:29:59] <gahr> https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/4ff0d334ad68c87233615fd27f5a68288dc55b63/alias/dlgalias.c#L98
[15:30:15] <gahr> this is not needed anymore, it's in alias/functions.h 
[15:30:31] <flatcap> good spot
[15:31:34] * flatcap thinks about alias_to_addrlist()...
[15:34:02] <flatcap> that sounds good
[15:44:50] *** Quits: whatsyourask (~whatsyour@user/whatsyourask) (Quit: whatsyourask)

[16:33:21] <gahr> I'm working on some other patch, will try the branch soon
[16:34:23] <flatcap> thanks, no rush
[16:44:03] <gahr> why is it tricky to let alias_to_addrlist do the appending
[16:45:58] <flatcap> because of the `first->personal = ...` messing around and the mutt_addrlist_to_intl() which is applied to the list
[16:47:13] <flatcap> we could move mutt_addrlist_to_intl() out of alias_to_addrlist() (and apply it afterwards)
[16:48:35] <gahr> ah I see
[16:49:05] <flatcap> it's not hard, just requires a little care
[16:49:12] * flatcap doesn't feel in a careful mood :-)
[16:51:54] <gahr> ok
[16:52:00] <gahr> I like the mail function in the aliasmenu
[16:52:30] <gahr> I am a bit unsure that if I tag many addresses, then mail without tag-prefix should mail just the selected one
[16:52:47] <gahr> I mean, does it ever make sense not to have auto tag in that dialog?
[16:53:27] <flatcap> yeah, that's the big question
[16:53:39] <flatcap> (it's trivial to restore the old behaviour)
[16:53:55] <flatcap> there's a similar situation in compose
[16:54:37] <flatcap> <group-alternatives>
[16:55:04] <flatcap> (and friends) only make sense with tagged attachments
[16:55:59] <flatcap> in the Alias Dialog, it makes sense for OP_DELETE/OP_UNDELETE to work "normally" w.r.t. tagging
[16:56:09] <gahr> devel/alias is nice :)
[16:56:25] <gahr> ah, true
[16:57:58] <flatcap> thanks :-)
[16:58:00] <flatcap> perhaps we doc some functions as "auto_tag"
[16:58:34] <flatcap> but then the user can't predict the behaviour, without reference to the docs
[17:00:13] <flatcap> hmm...
[17:01:54] <flatcap> actually, the difference between <group-alternatives> and <mail> (Alias/Query), is that <g-a> can ONLY work on tagged 
[17:02:47] <flatcap> perhaps any function that can work either way, MUST honour <tag-prefix>

[17:15:37] *** Joins: CrashOverride (~strcat@p54854c73.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[17:23:47] <gahr> you mean group alternative doesn't do anything if you haven't tagged anything?
[17:24:10] <gahr> yeah it probably makes more sense to keep things as they currently are
[17:24:36] <gahr> the "mail" command is consistent with the rest of the functions
[17:25:02] <gahr> even tagging then reply makes little sense
[17:26:39] <flatcap> yes, <g-a> needs a minimum of two attachments
[17:27:27] <flatcap> "as they currently are" in the PR?
[17:32:07] <gahr> yeah
[17:32:13] <flatcap> ok, cool
[17:32:41] <gahr> mh.. perhaps mail could be smart?
[17:32:50] <gahr> if there's any tagged alias, use them
[17:32:53] <gahr> otherwise, use the current one?
[17:33:00] <gahr> that'd mean assume auto_tag :/
[17:33:21] <gahr> not sure.

[18:16:10] <flatcap> great :-)
[18:16:25] <flatcap> it'd be nice to merge all the possible colours/attrs in the index (investigation needed first)
[18:20:03] <dcpurton> I think my colours are in a sufficiently beautiful state that I can now go to bed 😀
[18:22:37] <dcpurton> night all
