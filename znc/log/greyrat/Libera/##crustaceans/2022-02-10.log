[00:00:16] <Brekkjern> The only time you see a semicolon in Python code, someone is doing something they shouldn't.
[00:00:48] <manicennui> The answer to the real thing he is trying to point out is that the compiler often knows what you probably want, but it shouldn't just assume.
[00:00:53] <manicennui> That leads to early PHP.
[00:00:58] <manicennui> And MySQL
[00:02:21] <manicennui> Once again my boss wants to shift priorities, and when I start pushing back I discover that the thing that was brought to her attention will affect us in about 2 years.
[00:02:38] <manicennui> Hopefully she will settle down.
[00:05:22] <manicennui> I feel like inability to push back against this sort of thing makes a lot of devs hate their jobs
[00:06:53] <Brekkjern> gwozniak: You work a lot with C, right? Any credence to this? :P
[00:06:53] <Brekkjern> https://i.redd.it/9licn1jnptg81.jpg
[00:11:33] <manicennui> That is the exact pair he wears.
[00:16:19] <gwozniak> It's how I write my best code!
[00:16:45] <Brekkjern> That explains why they are often bought together...
[00:17:34] <Brekkjern> I'm betting the "frequently bought together" thing for Python is snakeskin pants or something :P
[00:19:12] <ehammarstrom> I may or may not own that book
[00:22:58] <manicennui> I did at one point
[00:23:08] <manicennui> And read most of it
[00:23:26] <ehammarstrom> I don't know why I have it, I've never read it; only skimmed a few pages but the code style kills me
[00:23:59] <edk> the code style in K&R2 is pretty antiquated, but the exercises are 100 emoji
[00:24:08] <manicennui> Well, there was a point in time when everyone felt the need to pretend to learn C lest they not be considered a real developer
[00:24:16] <gwozniak> I have both the first and second edition
[00:24:33] <edk> i think people who are learning to program in some other language should strongly consider doing the K&R exercises in that language
[00:26:20] <manicennui> I don't know about that.
[00:28:06] <gwozniak> I remember the exercises in the book being pretty good
[00:28:23] <ehammarstrom> I have my doubts, but I have not gone through them

[00:56:41] <gwozniak> Working on a bug that was filed.  The description is (slightly edited) "Floating point computations wrong when optimizations used".  No expected output.  Just a program that calls sprintf and puts some values in a char array, in a loop.
[00:57:04] <gwozniak> I could update the ticket and ask for clarification, but I know I won't get it
[00:57:29] <gwozniak> The person who filed the bug is notoriously bad at describing things in a useful manner
[01:01:31] <manicennui> Mark it as "cannot reproduce" and close it.

[19:25:51] <pja> Sovereign Citizen bullshit always boils down to ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to pay taxes! I never agreed to this!‚Äù in the end though.
[19:26:15] <pja> With the promise of a magic incantation that gets you out of your obligations to society.
[19:27:37] <pja> (Whether you think the state is good or bad, I think we can agree that, at least in the UK / US, the state has /power/ & that‚Äôs what counts. Not paying taxes because you think you have a magic incantation that acts as a legal get-out clause is not going to work.)
[19:30:01] <kline> yeah
[19:30:07] <kline> you cant just opt out of civil society
[19:30:16] <kline> you have to work to change it, not throw a tantrum
[19:34:13] <imode> unless you fuck off into the mountains.
[19:38:26] <manicennui> Love sitting down in the morning and having multiple people asking me shit on slack immediately.
[19:38:44] <manicennui> kline: Let me know where this civil society is.
[19:41:24] <kline> manicennui, uncivil as it may be, you're in it already
[19:41:46] <kline> access your politicians, join demonstrations, make your views heard and actively work to progress and realise them
[19:45:13] <manicennui> Isn't complaining on IRC enough?!
[19:45:28] <manicennui> My year end review is absolutely gushing...
[19:46:14] <gwozniak> I have to write a self-assessment soon.  It's not that difficult but I really don't look forward to doing it
[19:46:26] <manicennui> Boss included feedback from several layers of management in analytics going all the way up to the CTO/CAO.
[19:46:39] <manicennui> gwozniak: Fortunately this place makes it really straight forward.
[19:46:54] <manicennui> They do the least BS reviews I've seen.
[19:47:36] <manicennui> I also received the top rating. We'll see how that translates into compensation, the only thing I care about, tomorrow.
[19:48:54] <kline> best of luck
[19:49:27] <gwozniak> It's actually really good here.  I just don't like writing self-assessments
[19:49:34] <imode> me either.

[19:50:40] <gwozniak> Call meeting to discuss compiler requirements for a new part with the IDE team.  Discussion immediately turns to hardware debugger support
[19:51:22] <manicennui> gwozniak: I do bullet points.
[19:51:45] <manicennui> They basically want 3-5 "wins", and a short blurb about possible areas of focus for the future.
[19:51:46] <gwozniak> That's pretty much all that is required here, too
[19:52:26] <manicennui> Fortunately I can mostly mention the big projects I completed this year and be done with it.

[19:53:28] <manicennui> Boss is going to release comp info tomorrow morning. That is going to seriously affect my mood for the day.

[21:36:12] <manicennui> Coworker is unhappy with his review rating, and wants to know whether any of us were rated higher.
[21:36:29] <gwozniak> The answer is yes
[21:36:30] <manicennui> I'm generally a fan of transparency with other people on the team, but this just seems like it is going to pit people against each other.
[21:39:10] <manicennui> We only have three ratings, which is interesting.
[21:40:17] <manicennui> The three are basically needs improvement, satisfactory, and great.
[21:40:26] <manicennui> Although they are all worded in a way that is very positive.
[21:41:52] <imode> "you're just reinventing spark" "no I'm doing the same thing that spark is doing but in far less overhead and complexity".
[21:44:10] <manicennui> Until 2 years from now when you have discovered all the same problems they had and added similar complexity.
[21:46:15] <manicennui> The only reason I'd "reinvent spark" is if I had a very specific use case and didn't plan to generalize it.
[21:46:34] <manicennui> Like a queue that is processed by a bunch of lambdas with specific requirements.
[21:52:39] <imode> tadaaa, that's exactly what it is.
[21:53:02] <imode> only the lambdas are pluggable. basically it's an inference engine that works over streaming data with a constrained but flexible data model.
[21:53:19] <manicennui> So it is generalized.
[21:53:37] <manicennui> Maybe it will be fine, but most of the time you realize why the complexity exists later.
[21:53:52] <imode> eh, yes and no. general, yes. generalized, no. you don't do work on arbitrary blobs coming from sources.
[21:54:25] <imode> you do do work on facts that're preprocessed from events emitted from services and tools.
[21:54:48] <imode> it's not spark, in that you can't just connect any arbitrary thing together and do XYZ to it on a large distributed cluster.
[21:54:57] <imode> it's intended for inference.
[21:55:02] <imode> diagnostics, smarter metrics.
[21:55:10] <imode> maybe time series data.
[22:08:01] <manicennui> 3.5 hours of meetings today, but I never have more than 30 minutes between meetings.
[22:08:09] <manicennui> Only have a full hour free at the end of the day.
[22:10:20] <kline> apparently 7 billion GB of SSDs from WD have "factory contamination"
[22:10:49] <imode> ...contamination?

[22:10:56] <buttsbot> Factory contamination affects ‚Äúat least‚Äù 7 billion gigabytes of flash memory | Ars Technica
[22:11:51] <kline> i can only imagine they refer to physical contamination of the dies (dice?) that means flash that has since been sold is failing at higher rates, potentially non-catastrophically and subtly poisoning data held for years to come

[22:24:06] * manicennui looks through his unread Kindle books
[22:24:21] <manicennui> I should really read some of these.
[22:29:36] <bkero> I'm still unclear on what 'contamination' means.
[22:29:50] <bkero> Bad flux that means cold solder joints?
[22:29:59] <bkero> counterfeit NAND flash?
[22:30:07] <Brekkjern> Maybe the silicon wasn't pure enough?
[22:40:31] <kline> bkero, they dont say, but it could be anything
[22:41:01] <kline> it could be particles in the air from a failed filter, it could be a dissolved contaminant in the otherwise highly pure water, it could be a batch of bad silicon, etc
[22:41:48] <kline> could be machinery that was incorrectly maintained and produced metal filings
[23:30:56] <ngoldbaum> also stuff like this happens all the time, with all computer equipment
[23:31:31] <ngoldbaum> google published a paper showing how even CPUs that passed QA checks at the factory still silently produce garbage results sometimes
[23:31:52] <ngoldbaum> ofc this contamination issue is probably at a much higher failure rate than other hardware issues
