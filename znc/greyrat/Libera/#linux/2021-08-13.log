[00:42:31] <matsaman> what makes it more secure is that the only place that password lives is in your head
[00:42:36] <uwharrie> it's much harder to brute force a large key than it is a short password
[00:42:44] <matsaman> what makes it less secure is if you assume networks you're remoting into are what you think they are
[00:42:49] *** Quits: mjbatty (~mjbatty@82.2.17.205) (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
[00:42:59] <Dagmar> ...or that the hosts where you storing a key are secure when they're not
[00:43:02] <matsaman> uwharrie: right, but that's really comparing size not method
[00:43:14] <matsaman> you can say the same about a long passphrase vs short
[00:43:27] <Dagmar> ...which is why keeping the keys on your _workstation_ and using an ssh-agent to relay authentication requests all the way back to there is generally the right thing to do
[00:43:38] <chives> Dagmar: but id need some way to secure that... if my workstation is the most likely vulnerable target... seems a bad idea to have the password just plaintext on the disk
[00:43:49] <Dagmar> matsaman: Who allows >1024 character passwords, exactly?
[00:43:59] <matsaman> with keys you definitely have to think about the complete security of every place you store them
[00:43:59] <Dagmar> Christ
[00:44:06] <Dagmar> The password isn't in plaintext on the disk either
[00:44:22] <matsaman> Dagmar: IME a majority of places are still _limiting_ to 8 or 12 =P heh
[00:44:31] <Dagmar> The password you use to encrypt an ssh keypair is NOT being stored in plaintext with  the key
[00:45:01] <chives> So you're manually typing a password at some point?
[00:45:04] <matsaman> if you're talking to me, I didn't say that, so we're good =)
[00:45:08] <Dagmar> It's literally used to decrypt the body of the key, and then that key is only held in the memory of the ssh-agent

[00:45:12] <chives> it seems weird circular thing

[00:45:25] <Dagmar> chives: Ideally yes, but it's not required if you want to make a key that ahs no password
[00:45:31] <matsaman> chives: I think you're right to distrust it, but not for the reason you have stated =)
[00:45:33] <uwharrie> or you can invest in a yubikey or other hardware token
[00:45:41] <Dagmar> You just damn well limit who can possibly access that key if you make it passwordless
[00:45:55] <uwharrie> then you don't even have to worry about digitally securing the private key
[00:46:03] <Dagmar> An ssh agent typically is used to "unlock" the key when you login

[00:46:14] <matsaman> uwharrie: well, then you have to worry about securing a physical one, of course
[00:46:31] <Dagmar> Past that point you don't need to enter the password again.  Everything you connect to will simply query your local ssh agent and do the authentication challenge with it
[00:46:31] <matsaman> but that is arguably as good as holding the passphrase only in your head <shrug>

[00:50:14] <phogg> xprop list shows two entries for each, so I compared them with: diff -u <(xinput list 21) <(xinput list 14)
[00:50:16] <matsaman> you can probably approximate what you're used to with xset
[00:50:18] <phogg> the only difference is their IDs
[00:50:19] <Dagmar> Most likely it's that the two mice have sensors with different DPI

[09:04:16] <twainwek> overload of what?
[09:04:22] <AssKoala> power, if you overclocked at all
[09:04:30] <AssKoala> or if the parts just arent particularly good (or defective)
[09:04:33] <tintedfireglass> bad psu
[09:04:46] *** kulernil is now known as kuler
[09:04:51] <AssKoala> clearly we need a bingo card for VRM issues
[09:04:52] <twainwek> how would overclocking blow the vrm
[09:04:53] <Affliction> ^ that's one. Had a machien that kept eating GPUs until the PSU died and got swapped.
[09:05:08] <Affliction> Glad that was sorted before the prices went crazy.
[09:05:12] <AssKoala> well, the VRM is the voltage regulator module
[09:05:24] <AssKoala> so...if you screw with the voltage, the regulator may take offense
[09:05:25] <twainwek> yes, but the input power isn't gonna change by overclocking
[09:05:29] <Affliction> And cheap boards use the bare minimum for the VRM
[09:05:31] <Affliction> sure it is
[09:05:45] <tintedfireglass> Tech jesus (gamers nexus) recently made a video on bad psu s being bundled with newegg GPUs
[09:05:50] <twainwek> doesn't the regulator reduce the voltage?
[09:05:53] <Affliction> yes
[09:05:55] <AssKoala> tintedfireglass, dude I saw that, it was bs
[09:06:03] *** Joins: metah4ck3r (~meta@user/metah4ck3r)
[09:06:07] <Affliction> it takes the 12V, drops it to ~1.2 or so for the core
[09:06:13] <twainwek> yes...
[09:06:14] <AssKoala> tintedfireglass, not that they werent bs, but that they were bundling that garbage
[09:06:21] <Affliction> But, there's no such thing as a 100% efficient converter
[09:06:28] <tintedfireglass> Asskoala do U mean the video was bs or the psu were?
[09:06:38] <Affliction> some percentage of the energy is lost as heat
[09:06:39] <twainwek> but by overlocking you increase the power req of the core
[09:06:49] <twainwek> so how does that affect the regulator
[09:06:54] <AssKoala> tintedfireglass, that the PSU were, sorry, like the entire thing is bull on newegg / gigabyte's part
[09:06:58] <Affliction> yes, and so, the energy flowing through the VRM, and so, the heat dissipated by the VRM

[12:21:06] <MetalSutton> I have a running script, either python, or shell, stuck in a loop. The python code is autolaunched at boot, and monitors a button for avr programming. on pressing, it launches a programming sequence. But i have messed with the code, and for some reason when it successfully uploads, it keeps uploading repeatedly. (i can see the leds flashing on a hat)
[12:21:47] <esselfe> yes, preferably in /etc/default/grub (GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX) so it's always added when updating grub/linux

I'm used to looking at the "-/+ buffers/cache:" row to see what's used/free. I see "available". Was "+/- buffers/cache used" scrapped for redundancy?

Make is about determining the build order of targets and intermediate objects, while Cmake is about injecting system-specific settings into text files - which might themselves be Makefiles or C source or shell scripts.

[22:25:04] <kurahaupo> It seems like "building with cmake" is really using some other tools underneath to do the building after Cmake has rewritten the files; Cmake itself doesn't actually manage the order of compilation & linking, unless you mean that it simply builds everything regardless of whether it needs building or not.

[23:34:40] <joo> can i get the x server back where it used to be years ago (ctrl+alt+f7) and the first 6 ones are normal terminals ? (debian 10)
