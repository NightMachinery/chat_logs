[01:04:40] <blackop> i think you are missing the point
[01:04:55] <blackop> point is being nice not arrogant
[01:04:56] <sussudio> you sound rissian.
[01:05:00] <blackop> what?
[01:05:11] <sussudio> entitled.
[01:05:44] <somiaj> In this particular case you have gotten some snap.discord.discord profile from somewhere and it isnt' working. If it si a bug report it to the creater of said profile. You can also just disable the profile.
[01:05:53] <blackop> yea just 2 snap apps
[01:05:56] <somiaj> Note discord works just fine here, I install it using the .deb and a libarary from buster.
[01:06:04] <blackop> i wanna use them
[01:06:14] <blackop> i wish official .deb installation files existed
[01:06:23] <blackop> actually they exist but seems Debian denies them
[01:06:30] <blackop> discord and spotify
[01:06:46] <blackop> they need some dependency packages which debian doesnt have
[01:06:58] <somiaj> Debian cannot distribute non-free software without permission, just grab the software from discord or spotify.
[01:07:03] <blackop> somiaj: which version may i ask?
[01:07:21] <blackop> i just downloaded discord-0.0.17.deb from official website
[01:07:26] <somiaj> I'm running the current version of discord with out any problems (not I did have to install some obsolete lib from buster, but it isntalled just fine)

[01:44:37] <somiaj> If you see graphical glitches, apps crash, then search the kernel logs. If things are working as expected, don't try to create a problem that is not there. The kernel is verbose, that is just the nature of how it logs
[01:44:55] <blackop> ok ok
[01:44:58] <somiaj> often times it corrects the issue itself, but logs that it did so (because in some cases it might matter)
[01:45:05] <somiaj> well logs the issue
[01:45:14] <blackop> you guys are really aggressive
[01:45:22] <blackop> i dont like to ask here really
[01:45:42] <blackop> i mean you giving sharp answers
[01:46:08] <ede> logs btw, i'd prefer to have them with a timestamp instead of sequential numbers, would this be possible? would be easier to collect them just for the case. some fill up really fast.
[01:46:11] <somiaj> Well maybe if you would try to understand the answer the first time it was given to  you.
[01:46:36] <blackop> so i should ask here when my computer explodes
[01:46:37] <somiaj> ede: I'm not sure if the kernel does that. The numbers are a timestamp since boot I belive, but unsure if there is a way to adjust them
[01:46:43] <blackop> ok

[01:47:37] <blackop> i just wanted to learn what those messages/warnings/errors mean
[01:47:39] <blackop> nvm
[01:47:54] <somiaj> ede: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13890789/how-do-i-convert-dmesg-timestamp-to-custom-date-format seems there is a -T flag for this
[01:49:02] <somiaj> blackop: often they mean that hardware dosen't correctly follow ACPI specs. Missing firmware often is because there are multiple firmware files that one could use, and just because one is missing doens't mean another one isn't used instead. There is a lot of info in dmesg, and it is mostly just ifnormational for when you have an issue.

[01:54:42] <somiaj> Also with thousands of developers, each may not have the same idea as to what should/shouldn't be logged. Unfourntally some devs get into the lets log lots of things mentality, and it is hard to determine if something should be logged or not at the time.

[05:19:37] <blackop> even i enabled hidden folders appear in my home directory with ctrl+h they disappear after a while alone
[05:19:40] <blackop> is it normal?
[05:20:23] <dvs> so irc is private?
[05:21:07] <somiaj> dvs: no, I just know that there have been various discussions on if publically accessible logs should be a thing
[05:21:17] <somiaj> blackop: This may depend on the file manager you use
[05:22:23] <blackop> somiaj: it is gnome
[05:22:45] <blackop> also network locations i added disappear too
[05:22:53] <somiaj> blackop: that isn't a file manager, but here I assume you mean network-manager
[05:22:56] <somiaj> arg
[05:22:57] *** Joins: grobi (~grobi@user/grobi)
[05:22:59] <somiaj> I mean nautilus
[05:23:08] <somiaj> you should focus on one issue at a time, easier to debug
[05:24:18] <somiaj> blackop: it appears that in newer version of nautilus that keybinding isn't a presistant setting. If you want to always see hidden files, go though the options and toggle the option there
[05:24:53] <blackop> somiaj: i want hidden files/folders show or hide with ctrl+h
[05:24:55] <blackop> not alone
[05:25:02] <blackop> with ctrl+h i want to show or hide
[05:25:30] <somiaj> in newer versions of nautilus this isn't a presistant option, that jsut seems to be how it works
[05:26:45] <blackop> hmm
[05:27:55] <somiaj> you may want to dig through the nautilus docs to see if it is possible to revert this to its old behavior
[05:28:02] <somiaj> not something I use, so I have no clue where to look
[05:28:35] <blackop> well.. while installing dropbox i applied a command about nautilus but i dont remember what was it exactly

[05:44:12] <somiaj> blackop: okay, then my idea isn't appropriate. I'm unsure why network-manager is not saving the changes you are doing. Though since I don't use network-manager, I only know the common issues which you dont' have
[05:44:42] *** Joins: malloy (~jimery@116.30.222.122)
[05:44:48] <blackop> definitely something is wrong
[05:45:25] <blackop> in the added network locations it auto hides some folders
[05:45:32] <blackop> doesnt keep my ctrl+h
[05:45:47] <blackop> it hides automatically in very short time
[05:46:09] <blackop> for example when i open other folder and return back there i see folders are hidden

[06:07:48] <blackop> ok
[06:07:51] <blackop> thanks
[06:08:48] <blackop> what about folder view grid or list?
[06:08:57] <blackop> isnt it persistant too?
[06:09:48] <somiaj> look at the nautilus docs
[06:09:50] <blackop> after reboot list view changed to grid view
[06:10:01] <somiaj> but sounds like it isn't persistant as well
[06:11:23] <jmcnaught> Grid or list is persistent for me as far as I know.
[06:12:11] <blackop> why am i having annoying weird issues like this i dont know..
[06:13:47] <jmcnaught> blackop: when does it revert?  On login?  After some time in a session without logging out?
[06:14:15] <blackop> jmcnaught: i realized after reboot
[06:14:35] <blackop> lets test again
[06:14:37] <blackop> brb
[06:15:26] <dvs> what? after the update?
[06:16:23] <blackop> didnt change this time
[06:16:36] <blackop> i lately installed net-tools
[06:16:41] <blackop> not sure if it is related
[06:17:01] <blackop> dvs: no. there was an issue i faced
[06:18:03] <blackop> i added network locations to the bookmark. they dont disappear now
[06:18:09] <blackop> but lets watch
[06:18:27] <blackop> of course network locations disappear after reboot
[06:18:45] <blackop> but with click they come back
[06:20:50] <somiaj> hmm, well I found a post that said newer versions of nautilus the ctrl-H setting is no longer presistant and will reset as soon as nautilus is reset
[06:21:39] <blackop> how does nautilus reset?
[06:22:00] <somiaj> https://askubuntu.com/questions/837878/how-to-show-hidden-files-in-nautilus-3-20-3-ubuntu-16-10 -- "it and works in every nautilus version, the only difference to older versions is that the setting is persistent after closing and reopening nautilus." so seems to be a design change that they think key bindings should only effect the current running session and not be a persistant change
[06:22:13] <somiaj> blackop: just like any other app, after it is closed and repoen, rebooting will do this
[06:22:36] <blackop> is nautilus file manager of gnome?
[06:22:47] <blackop> new name "Files" ?

[07:10:09] <RooftopJoe> hi. it says here https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/ch04s03.en.html that in order to make a bootable usb stick, i need to unmount it, cp to /dev/sdb (in my case) and then sync. however, when i unmount in nautilus, it says that it cannot find /dev/sdb anymore. why is going on? is nautilus do something else on there?
[07:11:21] *** Joins: fling (~fling@user/fling)
[07:13:48] <dvs> RooftopJoe: it's nautilus.  Take the stick out, put it back in but do NOT mount it.
[07:14:15] <RooftopJoe> it will be mounted automatically
[07:15:06] <dvs> ouch
[07:15:18] *** Joins: tieinv (~tieinv@user/tieinv)
[07:16:39] <RooftopJoe> i suppose i need to unmount /dev/sdb1 from the terminal instead so /dev/sdb is not unmounted?

[07:19:48] <RooftopJoe> i suppose that is what they want me to unmount, no?

[07:22:24] <RooftopJoe> There also seems to be a sdb2, i guess i'll unmount both just in case
[07:22:45] <dvs> anything attached to sdb
[07:27:09] <RooftopJoe> seems to be working. idk why nautilus does this. pretty sure i did this in a previous version and i didn't encounter this problem.

[09:31:24] <somiaj> pflanze: Those bug reports do make it sound like issues with mice, though seems quality control just fixes it at the driver level in windows.
[09:31:45] <somiaj> maybe shop around for different mice as well, at least if that bug report is really what you are running across.
[09:32:24] <pflanze> Yes, the point of what people are saying is that *because* Windows added software debouncing, hardware manufacturers have started to get lenient lately.
[09:32:31] <pflanze> So it will not get better.
[09:33:01] <pflanze> And I can't fault the manufacturers, arguably doing it in the OS is the better place, since configurable.
[09:33:25] <pflanze> So I think it's wrong to claim that the issue is with the mice, really.
[09:33:30] <somiaj> Yea, hard to say where this belongs, most likely in xorg, since it is the one getting the events.
[09:34:12] <somiaj> It might just depend on what one expects the mice vs software to do. Having to correct for faulty click events does sound like a hardware issue, even if it is fixed at the software level.
[09:34:36] <pflanze> It's always software somewhere, if the mouse is doing it it will be the micro controller doing it.
[09:35:13] <pflanze> Switches do bounce, that's just what they do, AFAIK it's unavoidable.
[09:35:27] <somiaj> Yea, I'm sure as this becomes more and more common it wille ventaully be fixed in linux, though not sure if that is a good solution for you.
[09:35:32] <pflanze> (Short of using liquids like mercury.)
[09:35:55] *** Joins: dpkg (~dpkg@debian/bot/dpkg)
[09:36:09] <somiaj> Yea, so it depends on viewpoint if the firmware on the hardware should deal with this, vs software. I guess there are arguments for software, as some people may want to take advantage of this by hitting the button really hard to get a double click

[09:37:16] <somiaj> though this may explain an issue I had with an old mice I just replaced, it would have strange clicking issues. Though I got a good quality mouse and the issues just went away
[09:37:17] <pflanze> Possibly the blame could be put onto the USB spec for not declaring who is responsible.
[09:38:13] <somiaj> hmm, seems libinput has some debouncing configuration have you looked into that
[09:38:48] *** Quits: Gerowen (~Gerowen@172.97.17.26) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:38:54] <pflanze> Ah, no I haven't, does the *library* have configuration, where?
[09:39:44] <somiaj> It is the main xorg libarary most pointer devices use now
[09:40:38] <somiaj> http://who-t.blogspot.com/2017/07/libinput-and-button-debouncing.html -- this says it was added in 1.9 and bullseye is using 1.16.4
[09:41:10] <somiaj> it does look configurable, but not quite sure what file you need to edit. I would make sure you are actually using libinput and not the old evdev (which required a patch to add debouncing)
[09:41:50] <pflanze> Yes. Thanks, I'll check this out ASAP (busy next couple days).
[09:42:27] *** Joins: EvanCarroll (~ecarroll@68-78-105-35.lightspeed.hstntx.sbcglobal.net)
[09:42:52] <somiaj> hmm, well looking at 'man libinput' I don't see any option for debouncing, maybe it isn't configurable just yet
[09:45:46] <somiaj> https://askubuntu.com/questions/1199820/how-to-disable-mouse-debouncing-in-libinput -- this says you can make device quirks if needed by creating a file in /etc/libinput/local-overrides.quirks, though it only tells you how to turn bouncing off, but not how to configure the debouncing time
[09:46:52] <somiaj> pflanze: but I would check your xorg.log and double check your using libinput, if not switch to that and see if that helps

[12:51:52] <Khepra> Cool_Fire: are you trying to herd docker processes from outside the docker?
[12:52:40] <Cool_Fire> Well, mostly as a side-effect. Users can run unprivileged podman containers (with subuid/subgid mappings)
[12:52:57] <Cool_Fire> and user processes are herded into cpu/memory limiting cgroups
[12:53:12] <Khepra> shouldn't that be done with docker and podman controls?
[12:53:35] *** Quits: labrador (~labrador@user/labrador) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[12:53:46] <Cool_Fire> Probably, but that's besides the point. I don't even care if it herds the docker/podman processes at this point
[12:54:13] <Cool_Fire> I just want cgrulesengd to not hang and suck up a cpu core and not do any process herding for anything anymore
[12:54:42] *** Joins: Lope (~lope@user/lope)
[12:54:46] <Khepra> sounds like a bug then
[12:54:47] *** Quits: labrador_ (~labrador@user/labrador) (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:55:06] <Cool_Fire> The mere existence of a process with a uid that it can't resolve causes cgrulesengd to hang at 100%, regardless of it having any rules that would match it
[12:55:10] <Lope> Will zfs-2.1.3 come to bullseye-backports?
[12:55:18] <Khepra> Lope: probably
[12:55:20] <Lope> Or, when will it reach debian unstable?
[12:55:43] <Lope> Great news!
[12:55:53] *** Joins: labrador_ (~labrador@user/labrador)
[12:56:43] <Khepra> Lope: though, to be precise, not sure if _that_ specifc version will roll in, but it definitely does periodically rebase to newer upstream versions. that said, 2.1.3 is merely two weeks old, so... :)
[12:56:47] *** Quits: labrador_ (~labrador@user/labrador) (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:56:53] <Khepra> BUT... you should ask the maintainer to be sure
[12:56:58] <Lope> Have you guys used the Realtek 8156B USB 3.0 2.5G Ethernet adapter and gotten more than 1Gb/s out of it?
[12:57:50] <Cool_Fire> I have spotted something that might be a usable workaround. I can tell nsswitch.conf to look into a "db" (berkley database file). But I can't find any documentation on where it expects this db file to be stored, or what sort of data it expects to be in there

[13:24:50] <Haohmaru> kicad is like the blender of EDAs
[13:25:00] <Khepra> yeah, but does it change that often?

[13:26:19] <Haohmaru> you should, because it's wonderful

[13:27:14] <Khepra> ws2k3: also, you probably want to use ssh-agent so you don't have to retype the passphrase every time

[16:38:19] <rendar> Khepra, bluetooth is not working even with prev kernel version boot
[16:38:40] <sussudio> maybe you should stick with strictly stable, rendar.
[16:38:55] <Khepra> rendar: right. that's why I asked you to check. sometimes reboots trigger some demons in hardware and that coincides with an upgrade and people go chasing red herrings with the upgrade :)
[16:39:07] <rendar>  https://bpa.st/JH5Q
[16:39:18] <rendar> sussudio, this is Debian stable
[16:39:22] <rendar> bullseye is stable

[16:40:04] <rendar> i have just run apt-get upgrade
[16:40:25] <Khepra> rendar: those unstable clock messages aren't necessarily a problem. the kernel always chekcs all the clock sources available and decides which one to use, hpet in this case

[16:41:08] <rendar> now, how to make bluetooth working again? i can't use the machine without bluetooth
[16:41:09] <Khepra> rendar: so anyway... since the kernel has zero messages about the BT device, not even "found it but herp-derp issues"... I'd check the hardware; or EFI/BIOS to see maybe some switch flipped
[16:41:24] <rendar> WTF?
[16:41:28] <rendar> switch flipped automatically?
[16:41:34] <Khepra> EFI is instrumentable from the OS
[16:41:35] <rendar> this is the kernel
[16:42:01] <Khepra> efivars can be altered by the OS. who knows what happened. maybe the EFI/BIOS is buggy and it flipped itself, or the hardware literally died and the reboot voltage spike just put the final headshot in it
[16:42:07] <rendar> the hardware? how can i check something built into the motherboard!
[16:42:12] <rendar> the bluetooth controller is there!

[17:41:41] <Khepra> if it's udev, then it's likely some rules that fails to register the BT hardware
[17:41:43] <rendar> and why also the older kernel don't see bluetooth controller anymore?!
[17:41:55] <Khepra> because older kernel has the newer udev
[17:42:03] <rendar> Khepra, it worked perfectly, how a system be so fragile?
[17:42:09] <rendar> nobody touched udev, and its conf files
[17:42:18] <Khepra> well apt did, the package upgraded

[17:44:11] <rendar> with Apple's stuff an upgrade NEVER, and i say __NEVER__ interrupted some hardware functioning
[17:44:15] <kjetilho> rendar: it is impossible to do regression checks for all kinds of hardware out there.
[17:44:24] <kjetilho> Apple has 3 models of hardware to check
[17:45:03] <kjetilho> and I could say the same for my Fedora.  it has NEVER caused hardware to stop working for me.

[17:45:43] <Khepra> for most users it won't. these are edge cases that _can_ happen

[21:32:20] <PerfDave> If that's how you configured it yeah. I expect the settings you change will only take effect when the connection is activated.

[21:33:20] <lntl> Hi #debian. Strange thing just happened, curious if you know about it. I was just ssh'd into a debian machine and did an apt update/upgrade. After the process completed, my ssh connection started behaving weird. PS1 garbled, commands not found, etc. I closed the connection and tried to open a new one. Upon opening a new connection, I am returned a Permission denied (publickey). The thing is, I was just using thuis key a second ago and didn't change it. What's happ

[23:13:24] <naptastic> Hi. I have a fairly recent installation of Debian Bookworm, and noticed that (1) bridge-utils isn't available as a package anymore, and (2) bridges defined in /etc/network/interfaces don't come up. I'm learning the syntax for the `bridge` command from iproute2. What's the magic for persistent bridges now?

[23:19:00] <jmcnaught> naptastic: try #debian-next on irc.oftc.net (not libera, a different IRC network) for bookworm and sid support.
[23:19:26] <raccct> Just to add my question again: My debian vps reported networking.service failed with RTNETLINK answers: Permission denied. I wasn't sure how to fix it so I did a complete reinstalled of debian from the provider and it seems that the failed networking.service is there from the start. Gernerally the network works but having this failed service in red staring at me feels wrong. what is your opinion?
