[00:09:27] <pyzozord> hi I worked on this little "local .bashrc files" project. I've been using it for few days now. I have to say, even in this very prototypal form, this is incredibly convenient!
[00:09:34] <pyzozord> here is the code https://ideone.com/b3XMEU
[00:09:49] <pyzozord> let me know if you see any ideas to improve this and general optinons
[00:10:24] <lopid> .bashrc is already local
[00:10:30] <twkm> thebombzen: i prefer using an index, ignoring what's no longer needed.

[11:29:50] <geirha> You'd have to calculate how much the FS will use in order to leave 1024 bytes available, in addition, you'll need to set block size and such that 1024 is actually possible as remaining space. It's more of a #linux question, unless there's a channel for the ext series of filesystems

[14:40:01] <Alphare> hi there. I'm trying to make a script more portable. The line is `hg "\$@" 1> >(sh $killable_pipe) 2> >(sh $killable_pipe >&2)`, and I think the process substituion syntax does not work on the bash version I'm forced to use
[14:40:14] <earnestly> Helmholtz1: Then yes, posix doesn't have / or // and will need either sed/tr or clever use of the other PEs to approximate it

[14:40:43] <Helmholtz1> for this task

[14:48:04] <greybot> Process Substitution: <(command) or >(command) is replaced by a FIFO or /dev/fd/* entry. Basically shorthand for setting up a named pipe. See <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ProcessSubstitution>. Example: diff -u <(sort file1) <(sort file2)

[15:09:17] <earnestly> kurahaupo: https://0x0.st/-fbm.txt
[15:09:33] <Helmholtz1> Now that I've written a couple of scripts past year, I liked the idea of piping (|) . Is functional programming about this?
[15:09:42] <Helmholtz1> Is there any other proper language that feels like this
[15:09:50] <izabera> haskell?
[15:09:55] <izabera> dunno i don't do fp
[15:10:20] <earnestly> Helmholtz1: http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/monadic-shell.html
[15:10:51] <earnestly> Helmholtz1: But for something to FP, it must be pure.  If it's not pure, then it's just proceedural programming
[15:10:53] <kurahaupo> What's the point of writing ${x//%/abc} instead of just ${x}abc
[15:10:55] <earendel> isnt that example extending anything?
[15:11:22] <earendel> i understand it matches on the digits.. but then each the d is just the digt .. where is the expansion happening?
[15:11:40] <earendel> expansion
[15:12:34] <earendel> its too
[15:12:37] <earendel> complicated.
[15:13:21] <earendel> #a="blah"; echo ${a%%ah}

[15:13:34] <shbot> earendel: bl
[15:13:35] <kurahaupo> x=xyz ; echo ${x//%/abc}  ${x//#/def}
[15:13:41] <kurahaupo> # x=xyz ; echo ${x//%/abc}  ${x//#/def}
[15:13:42] <Helmholtz1> When we do if command in POSIX sh, does it invoke [ ?
[15:13:43] <shbot> kurahaupo: xyz xyz
[15:13:50] <izabera> what
[15:13:54] <kurahaupo> # x=xyz ; echo ${x/%/abc}  ${x/#/def}

[15:14:15] <izabera> kurahaupo: //# //% make no sense, no?
[15:14:23] <kurahaupo> true
[15:14:46] <kurahaupo> (it's from earnestly's paste)
[15:15:09] <izabera> kurahaupo: which one is better?     ! case foo in bar) baz; false; esac     vs     case foo in bar) baz;; *) false;; esac        
[15:15:11] <earnestly> Hm
[15:15:13] <kurahaupo> bash -c 's=${1:7}; printf %b "${s//%/\\x}"' _ "$1"
[15:15:26] <izabera> surely they want to replace all the %
[15:15:33] <Soliton> Helmholtz1: you invoke [ when you call [.
[15:15:43] <izabera> >you invoke [ when you invoke [
[15:15:56] <earnestly> kurahaupo: Yes, it's replacing literal % with \x (percent decoding)
[15:16:11] <kurahaupo> oh right!
[15:16:23] <Helmholtz1> so POSIX implements its own logic checking
[15:16:42] <izabera> !firstlearnbash

[15:42:32] <TomyWork> (as they do when saved from german microsoft excel, iirc)

[15:47:23] <earnestly> If you have control over the format and can ensure it follows the rules then csv can be treated as a simple dsv where no escaping rules are necessary

[15:49:05] <earendel> polirbuero nighrMAW RIGHT
[15:49:26] <earendel> exactly.
[15:49:27] <kurahaupo> omegatron: It's fairly common for a CSV file to comprise a series of newline-separated records, where each record comprises comma- (or tab-) separated fields, where each field can by either a run of text that does not contain comma (or tab), double-quote, or newline, or a double-quoted string that can contain any single characters except " and \ , and any pair of characters comprising \ and any character. Which means that quoted a 
[15:49:27] <kurahaupo> string can span multiple lines
[15:50:05] <omegatron> back then, I had to handle often files, which used the "real" separator Bytes 0x1C - 0x1F

[15:55:41] <TomyWork> which is why I'm saying that the first step in parsing csv is going back to the drawing board and picking a different format.

[19:45:05] <izabera> what do you think `` does?
[19:45:52] <toretto> I subsitues the output of the command. Like, $FOO=`cat foo.txt`, Here it will run the command and put the output in the FOO variable.

[19:50:39] <izabera> that's why you can see it printed

[19:52:10] <toretto> Oh, it doesn't "store" that capture output. I think I got it. 
[19:53:10] <toretto> So, if it's captured it's stord somewhere like in a variable or something, but in this case, it tries to execute output it but since those contents are not a command, it just errors out. 
[19:53:45] <Soliton> i see no errors.

[19:54:35] <toretto> Since the body of the Content of the HTTP request is outputed in stdout, `` captures that and it tries to execute.

[21:13:05] <apos> hello people just a quick question. does a+=1 work in bash?
[21:13:46] <lopid> # a=0; a+=1; echo "$a"
[21:13:48] <shbot> lopid: 01
[21:14:03] <apos> that was quick thank you very much :)
[21:14:21] <lopid> # a=0; let a+=1; echo "$a"
[21:14:22] <shbot> lopid: 1
[21:14:46] <apos> btw to script on terminal each ";" indicates a line change?
[21:14:56] <lopid> !;
[21:14:56] <greybot> The ";" character is used to separate between commands. It does the (almost) exact same thing that <ENTER> does in a shell or a newline in a script.
[21:15:35] <apos> again thank you i guess without let it just adds strings together
[21:16:00] <omegatron> yes

[21:16:51] <lopid> yes
[21:16:56] <apos> makes sense
[21:17:02] <omegatron> yes, check   help declare  for more explanation
[21:18:06] <twkm> so it can "work" to not have let or (()) but it is generally surprising.
