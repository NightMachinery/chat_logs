[00:43:54] <[itchyjunk]> ah
[00:44:45] <mycroftiv> i write 'for all foo, there exists bar such that whatever-holds' and then i figure out what mathematical/logical reasons there are for that, and then i try to persuade agda of these things, and agda internally has some insane pile of lambda-spaghetti as the machine-language

[00:47:08] <mycroftiv> if you can write simple haskell code and you have some knowledge of mathematics you are more than prepared for lean/coq/agda/whatever
[00:48:43] <mycroftiv> actually the propositional logic you were doing is more foundational in my opinion

[00:59:58] <CloudEvil> Find a good well regarded encryption system, then implement it in Lisp or whatever.

[01:02:30] <Musli> my masters is about making your own Encryption engine so i thought i ask here.
[01:02:44] <[itchyjunk]> wouldn't you need to formally prove your implementation is exactly the same as original?
[01:02:50] <CloudEvil> What do you meanb by 'encryption engine'
[01:03:02] <CloudEvil> [itchyjunk]: yes, but that is trivial and there are tests about that for the encryption system.
[01:03:23] <CloudEvil> You have to try really hard to pass the bitwise tests, and make something that doesn't work.
[01:03:25] <[itchyjunk]> idk about it being trivial.. probably depends on language and such
[01:03:30] <Ox5cfb> [itchyjunk]: if your goal is learning to use proof assistants, there is a pretty good (and interactive) book "Software Foundations"
[01:03:47] <CloudEvil> Oops, missed the formally proove.
[01:03:52] <Ox5cfb> (in Coq, but there is a maybe an equivalent for Agda/lean)
[01:03:53] <CloudEvil> That is considerably a different topic.
[01:03:55] <[itchyjunk]> I suck at reading books is my big issue :( my low attention gets in my way
[01:04:12] <Ox5cfb> it is more like a serie of exercice
[01:04:28] <mycroftiv> for agda the equivalent is 'PLFA' https://plfa.github.io/
[01:04:41] <[itchyjunk]> Yes i started coq. i did a `n+0 = 0` and `P->Q and Q->R then P->R` in coq then gave up

[13:39:29] <isekaijin> Hello, everyone. I don't like this, but maybe I'll spend New Year studying mathematics.
[13:39:40] <isekaijin> What's a good book on equivariant cohomology for dummies?
[13:40:49] <arseniiv> (unrelated) hey I seemed to know a while ago that gamma function (shifted by 1) is the continuous (or better infinitely smooth) analog to factorial, meaning it’s the inf. smooth solution to f(0) = 1, f(x) = x f(x−1). A while after that I seemed to hear there are other solutions (so one can’t just phase out two notions of Γ and factorial and name them the same way). Or maybe they were talking about just plain continuous solutions or
[13:40:49] <arseniiv> 1-smooth solutions? I don’t think I could solve this equation by myself to sort things out alone
[13:41:28] <arseniiv> oh well why I said infinitely smooth if I could even say analytical. Forgot Γ was even this good
[13:41:44] <riv> well Gamma comes up in complex analysis
[13:41:59] <riv> it's meromorphic
[13:42:07] <arseniiv> it does, I know, and in probability by itself and beta
[13:42:16] <HisShadow> arseniiv: pretty sure there was one other equation for gamma to be a unique solution
[13:42:17] <arseniiv> ah damn I forgot about poles
[13:43:06] <mycroftiv> isekaijin: have you looked at this small and vaguely comprehensible equivariant cohomology pdf? https://math.berkeley.edu/~gmelvin/flags/ec_flagsf13.pdf

[13:43:16] <arseniiv> HisShadow: there is an integral for gamma, and of course any power series would suffice, but I would like to get Γ as a unique extension of the factorial

[13:45:42] *** Joins: RawFiend (~textual@176.54.66.45)
[13:45:44] <arseniiv> like, can we just require the functional equation factorial satisfies (above) and add analyticity (if we know beforehand that we should exclude negative integers) or meromorphy. Though it’d be way more cool if gamma would still be the only solution if we ask just for N-smoothness for some N, or ∞-smoothness
[13:46:42] <HisShadow> arseniiv: I think you only need to have f be logarithmically convex for there to be a unique solution to that equation
[13:46:44] <riv> From Freitag, there is a characterization of the Gamma function: Let f be analytic and bounded in a vertical strip 1 <= x < 2

[14:11:01] <isekaijin> It becomes clearer when you look at the general theory of integral extensions of rings. A generalization of this idea is to take the ring extension R^G -> R, where R is a ring, G is a finite subgroup of Aut(R). and R^G is the subring of G-invariants.
[14:11:03] <isekaijin> The resulting map Spec(R) -> Spec(R^G) is surjective, has finite fibers, and there is a bijective correspondence between points of Spec(R^G) and G-orbits in Spec(R).

[14:14:44] <mycroftiv> ideals and filters and maps paramaterized by the spaces of maximal ideals and filters give you strong algebraic structure preserving homomorphisms with well-structured quotients for all kinds of 'we want an embedding/extension relation between structures'
[14:15:25] <riv> it soudns like this is the master theorem for all maths

[14:18:00] <mycroftiv> because the homomorphism from boolean true/false onto an infinite set is the simplest and most core relation between two-valued set membership and the powerset lattice - you map logical structure from finite to infinite with it
[14:18:28] <riv> not the other way around?
[14:18:35] <mycroftiv> it goes both ways!
[14:18:53] <mycroftiv> thats the beauty of it, you can go from infinite powerset -> 2 valued truth, or the other way around
[14:19:05] <riv> not sure i have enough coffee for this
[14:19:37] <isekaijin> Okay, it seems like Peter Clark's commutative algebras already have a section on the SRT, so looking at that.
[14:20:16] <isekaijin> Not sure if this has such grand ambitions as “understanding the structure of the set-theoretic universe”, but at least I should learn something about Boolean algebras today.
[14:20:25] <mycroftiv> riv: yes the main use is you want to go from something that takes a value in an infinite algebra to just true/false so you quotient by an ultrafilter

[14:25:57] <isekaijin> Errr, I meant “Peter Clark's commutative algebra *notes*”.
[14:26:01] <mycroftiv> the idea is so fundamental that the whole idea of convergence to limits maps to this, if you look at basic topological definitions, T1/Hausdorff spaces are characterized by ultrafilters giving limits
[14:26:34] <riv> I've seen this ultra* stuff used to construct nonstandard analysis

[14:27:36] <riv> i just started thinking about sequences
[14:27:45] <riv> of numbers
[14:28:17] <mycroftiv> yes thats how you can make nonstandard models of simple arithmetic - use an ultrafilter on N to quotient infinite nat-sequences
[14:28:26] <mycroftiv> then apply operations pointwise
[14:29:50] <mycroftiv> given an ultrafilter on N, we can treat functions N -> N as the 'natural numbers' of nonstandard model and decide if f > g by seeing if the set of indices for which f(n) > g(n) is an element of the ultrafilter
[14:30:50] <zacts> hello ##math
[14:30:57] <zacts> what's the topic of discussion?
[14:31:04] <riv> I see
[14:31:14] <riv> it's amazing that we can do that
[14:31:42] <mycroftiv> then you just do arithmetic operations pointwise so a new 'nat-seq' composed from f + g is just h(n) = f(n) + g(n) and so forth, and you have the standard naturals as  1 1 1 1 1... and 2 2 2 2... but for instance  1 2 3 4 5 6 is a 'nonstandard natural' that is > than all the standard nats because it is > any constant n for all n as ultrafilter member
[14:32:24] <mycroftiv> the large cardinals of set theory at measurable and beyond are saying an ultrafilter exists on a set much larger than N which lets us perform this ultra-construction with the entire universe of sets!
[14:33:17] <mycroftiv> and consider sequence-functions from a large-cardinal sized ordinal to all elements of the set-universe V, and quotient those functions by the ultrafilter on the large cardinal to get a new model
[14:33:55] <mycroftiv> and if we can do this, the mathematical universe has to be NON-minimal, Gödel's constructible universe L has no such ultrafilter

[14:35:58] <isekaijin> zacts: “Working” between Christmas and New Year? Really?
[14:36:31] <mycroftiv> which is why i have made lots of weird agda files like http://wiki.9gridchan.org/incoming/mycro/agdahtml/Measurable-cardinals.html
[14:38:41] <mycroftiv> but sheaves are actually the answer to the questions i didnt know how to answer at the time i made that file
[14:38:47] <zacts> is this category theory?
[14:38:59] <mycroftiv> its set theory category theory and type theory all at once really
[14:39:24] <mycroftiv> algebraic homomorphisms are probably best understood with category theory once you get some familiarity
[14:39:48] <mycroftiv> but i study the set theoretic/boolean algebraic expression and how to put it into type theory so a computer can understand
[14:42:44] <mycroftiv> which ends up using formalized category theory and set theory inside type theory, like http://wiki.9gridchan.org/incoming/mycro/agdahtml/GenericSets.html and http://wiki.9gridchan.org/incoming/mycro/agdahtml/ExactFunctor.html

[17:34:07] <Stefan26> what does the matrix [1,1;-1,1] do geomertically to a 2d-vector (x,y) I know it becomes (x+y,y-x) but is there an interpretation?
[17:34:12] <Stefan26> e.g. some rotation reflection combo?
[17:36:09] <DarkMatter42> Stefan26, you can plug in numbers and plot to get an intuition :)

[23:32:10] <jens_> I'm confused. If p is a tautology, is "q implies p" true for any q?

[23:33:49] <jens_> nvm, of course it is
[23:33:54] <mycroftiv> if p true, q implies p for any q , because material implication is [ (not p) or q ]

[23:37:26] <[itchyjunk]> p->q => not(p) or q ?
[23:37:40] <mycroftiv> material implication classical 'implies' always feels conceptually weird when you break it down like that, because the natural language 'implies' demands a connection of causality

[23:39:59] <mycroftiv> *yes. its also why 'principle of explosion' works and is how constructive intuitionistic logic differs from classical, because the implication arrow in heyting algebra isnt as strong as in boolean
[23:40:22] <jens_> sounds interesting
[23:41:04] <jens_> i'm stepping back from reading up on modal logic, checking if i even understand the simplest things...

[23:43:11] <Gurkenglas> Is there a way to derive the definition of adjunction as something that one would expect to be interesting?
[23:44:44] <mycroftiv> which kind of adjunction, adjoint functors?
[23:44:55] <Gurkenglas> no, the one that can be done in any 2-category.
[23:45:09] <Gurkenglas> a monad is just a endofunctor monoid, a category is just a span monad, a function is just a span adjunction, what's an adjunction?
[23:46:03] <mycroftiv> i dont understand higher category theory at all really sorry, so im lost on 'span monad'

[23:47:34] <riv> I'm not sure what the point of your question is Gurkenglas
[23:47:57] <riv> and im not sure how "category is just a span monad" makes sense
[23:48:20] <Gurkenglas> mycroftiv, a span is two arrows with the same source. a 2-cell between spans A<-X->B and A<-Y->B is an X->Y such that the two triangles commute. The composite of A<-X->B and B<-Y->C is A<-Z->C where a z is a pair x,y with the same b. A category is a span O<-A->O with a 2-cell O->A and a 2-cell AxA->A satisfying the monad axioms of unitality and associativity.

[23:49:19] <mycroftiv> thanks, that makes sense, ive read some n-categorical definitions but i always forget them because im still trying to grasp a lot of basic categorical constructions and topos theory
[23:51:54] <Gurkenglas> so now i'd like to know why one would expect to find interesting results from the definition of adjunction as arrows L,R with 2-cells Id=>RL and LR=>Id such that L=>LRL=>L is Id and R=>RLR=>R is id. Does this definition distinguish itself somehow?
[23:54:34] <mycroftiv> do people have that expectation and do they get interesting results from that definition?
[23:55:10] <riv> you just want a diagrammatic definition of adjunction?
[23:55:33] <Gurkenglas> riv, didn't I just give a diagrammatic definition?
[23:55:42] <riv> ok
[23:56:08] <riv> what are you asking
[23:56:41] <Gurkenglas> riv, what is the most abstract-nonsensical, compact way to identify the concept of adjunction?

[23:59:20] <riv> maybe if you restrict to just monadic adjunctions, you can define them from a monad in a nice way

[23:59:37] <Gurkenglas> i'd like the full thing
[23:59:46] <mycroftiv> well standard categorical adjunctions just nicely preserve ordering relations so higher categorical adjunctions should also preserve operations on ordering relations or analogous?
