[02:08:07] <Panther> This was a long long day.
[02:08:35] <Panther> It was snowing when I left to meet some ppl to climb up East Rock along the trails to the monument at the top.
[02:09:03] <Panther> However, while a woman was helping me lock my bike to her bike rack, everyone else took off and left us behind.
[02:09:30] <Panther> So, we tried to catch up, but I still can't go very fast, so she said she needed to catch up, so she ran off.
[02:10:14] <Panther> Now... I didn't know which way they went either, or which trail they took, so I figured the best way was to go straight up the side of the mountain, and hope to intersect the trail. :)
[02:10:57] <Panther> This wasn't easy.. it has been snowing so the leaves, rocks, trees, etc.. were all wet and the ground was covered with them.

[02:13:44] <Panther> My legs and hands are cut up by the various things.. It was good exercise...after that I rode back to sit with them for like 30 mins at a BBQ place, and then rode to a coffee shop to meet some other ppl.
[02:14:29] <Panther> I had some benzalkonium chloride wipes to deal with the cuts. :)

[02:19:36] <Panther> It was 35F and I climbed up there in shorts, Nike running shoes w/o socks, a t-shirt, and a fleece jacket.
[02:19:44] <Panther> Thanks Chickie :)

[02:19:56] <Chickie> you are welcome

[02:21:36] <Panther> I had to do something, cuz that woman didn't give me her #, and I didn't want her driving off with my bike. :)

[02:58:27] <Bakunin> you're an odd one, Panther :)
[02:58:34] <Panther> Well.. my friend and I went there around Halloween because there were supposed to be haunted houses.
[02:59:18] <Panther> We didn't see any of those, but we did go through a cemetary in which someone apparently was using part of a big branch to pry open one of the graves that had a marble slab on top.
[02:59:41] <Panther> So, we decided to take it out and put it back.
[02:59:57] <Bakunin> take what out
[03:00:10] <Bakunin> oh the branch had propped up the slab
[03:00:21] <Panther> The branch.. it was jammed into the grave where they were prying it open.
[03:01:03] <Panther> So, who happens to come by as we are doing this but the Sheriff himself. :)
[03:01:04] <louipc> you might have prevented a zombie apocalypse
[03:01:21] <Panther> And he wants to know what we are up to. :)
[03:01:26] <louipc> heros are always misunderstood
[03:02:07] <louipc> sheriff was probly there to bury evidence
[03:02:23] <Panther> He did help us fix the thing, but then he said that being in that town in a cemetary after dark was a class c misdemeanor, and if we didn't want him to arrrest us, we had to leave town right away.
[03:03:13] * Panther shrugs
[03:03:36] <Bakunin> yeah the sheriff was doin it
[03:03:37] <louipc> yep you were onto him
[03:03:43] <Bakunin> 100%
[03:03:49] <Panther> There weren't any signs that said stay out, but I didn't really want to be able to sing 'I shot the sheriff...'
[03:04:28] <Panther> Yeah, he prolly has all his graft money stashed there.
[03:04:45] <louipc> yea but u woulda stopped a zombie apocalypse and solved all the missing persons cases in the town at the same time
[03:05:09] <Panther> Mutant zombies are the worst.
[03:06:32] <Panther> They have extra appendages, and they don't die if you blow their head off.. some have 2 heads, anyway, maybe even 3.
[03:07:48] <Panther> None of those things are nice... mimmies, either.. then you get the dreaded mummy rotting disease when they touch.
[03:07:56] <Panther> mummies, too.
[03:09:56] <Panther> One of the guys in that pic is a surgeon who has a residency here at Yale.
[03:10:23] <Panther> He is trying to create a new medical specialty involving chronic wound care.
[03:10:54] <Panther> But... I need to ask him now about this mummy rotting disease, because it is not only a disease, but a curse, too. :(
