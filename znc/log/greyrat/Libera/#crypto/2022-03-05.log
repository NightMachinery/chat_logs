[00:00:09] <caveman> undecided yet.  might be chacha20
[00:00:33] <maroon> you need a good rng to avoid the weakest link being the guessing of what x was randomly chosen

[00:02:06] <maroon> having a long DH prime can make it slow, but that can be mitigated by selecting your x as a 'short exponent' to speed up the math. but to do that, you MUST use a safe prime, and generally the bit length of x needs to be at least double the symmetric key length
[00:02:28] <int-e> maroon: or RC4 as implemented in http://underhanded-c.org/_page_id_16.html
[00:03:16] <maroon> with a short exponent, you do something like, rand(0,2^512-1) then force the topmost bit to be 1
[00:05:01] <int-e> Forcing the top bit is only moderately helpful; an attacker can just divide by g^2^511 and hope what remains has a small exponent. However, random numbers in [0,2^512) are *very* unlikely to be small.
[00:06:04] <maroon> the topmost bit forced to 1 is mainly to make it more likely to be constant time
[00:06:16] <int-e> Ah. That I can see.
[00:06:23] <int-e> Thanks

[00:07:11] <caveman> should the exponent be any random number?  and it doesn't matter if it's prime or not?
[00:08:22] <maroon> the more random the better
[00:09:13] <caveman> why did you subtract 1 in the rand(..., ..--1) range?
[00:09:24] <maroon> no the exponent doesnt need to be random, its perfectly fine to be an even number, as long as it's not a poison number like 5^0 mod p, or 5^q mod p
[00:09:59] <maroon> for the same reason 2^8-1 is the largest 8 bit number
[00:10:05] <caveman> should the range exclude 0?  e.g. rand(1, ...)?
[00:10:35] <caveman> oh, because 2^8 is just going back to 0, so a bad range, effectively meaning zero to zero?
[00:10:50] <maroon> random number must not be 0 or 2^0, but it's permitted for it to 2^20 2^21 etc
[00:11:32] <maroon> the exponent isn't being modulo'ed by 2^512, just that this avoids the infinitely small chance that it's a 513-bit number
[00:12:49] <maroon> if you're having a full size range for your x, it depends if the order of the safeprime is q or 2q. if order is q, range [2,q-1] otherwise range [2,p-2]
[00:13:13] <maroon> an exercise for the cave dude to figure out why it's a bad idea for x to be p-1
[00:13:41] <caveman> because it's an even number?
[00:13:54] <maroon> no, do the math with any prime and any base
[00:14:37] <maroon> this also known as the fermat primality test
[00:15:42] <maroon> when the order=q, you must avoid x=q for the same reason

[18:46:57] <maroon> int-e, if you try to import safe primes that don't have order=2q for either 2 or 5, does ssh reject them? https://mypastebin.com/V1D0tmPq contains safe primes from rfc 3526 or 7919 that won't work with order=2q except for the g i've listed, so i'm curious if it rejects these, or goes ahead and uses themn with order=q? or what happens if you try to use them with g=31 or whether works for order=2q
[18:48:02] <maroon> river, it might be, it's probably rare that people would be gathering from such a large range, and even if they did, they might not notice if they still got a lot of hits

[18:59:27] <maroon> a range of this 2^33 size should be generating 352 safe primes at bit length 8192, then toss 1/6th of them. and few people would want to generate so many primes, and wouldn't care if they got 'only' 100 of them

[19:19:03] <int-e> It doesn't seem too bad anyway; it loses about 1/4 of the candidates in the sieving stage for bits=16384
[19:20:01] <maroon> i would think the overflow would have zero effect until it passes the overflow barrier, at which point everything would be trash
[19:20:30] <int-e> I'm mostly interested in the gap between 44 safe primes we expect there and the maybe 20 that I'll actually get. 25% loss, than a 16% loss, and some bad luck... close enough.
[19:22:21] <maroon> if the range is 2^32 for sophie and 2^33 for 'p', then i'm calculating the expected count should be double the 44
[19:22:23] <int-e> maroon: The main trouble is this kind of thing  https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/master/moduli.c#L210-L211  when s is close to 2^32 (and that *is* happening since it sieves up to 2^32 - 2^16)

[19:24:18] <int-e> maroon: Nah, the estimate with the 1.32 factor is for Sophie-Germain primes. And the log is essentially the same.
[19:24:48] <int-e> (~16383.5 ln(2) vs. ~16382.5 ln(2))
[19:28:18] <maroon> int-e, if you attempt to import my sample safe primes that don't have order=2q except when g > 5, does it refuse to import those?
[19:28:27] <int-e> I don't care.
[19:31:12] <maroon> so if half the 2^33 range gets trashed by overflow, the expected would be 44 * (1/2) * (5/6) = 18
[19:33:24] <int-e> No need to guess, it gets 2.9M candidates out of 3.6M. (So 20% rather than that 25% number)
