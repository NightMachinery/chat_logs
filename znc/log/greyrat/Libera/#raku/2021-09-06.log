[02:12:51] <japhb> xinming: Missed your discussion yesterday, but not that the CBOR format is designed to be extensible for exactly things like Captures that you want to be able to roundtrip and can be described semantically, but may only be "native" in some languages.  CBOR::Simple (which I wrote) supports this conceptually, but I have not yet added Capture as an explicit extension.
[02:13:41] <japhb> xinming: Anything I should know about your use case that would imply something more advanced than "2-tuple of positional and associative tagged to roundtrip as a Capture object"?
[02:14:04] <japhb> *but note that
[02:14:49] <japhb> (I suspect that a similar concept is needed by Lua for tables, but I'm not a Lua expert)
[02:16:10] <japhb> Oh, I should also note that CBOR::Simple is *way* faster than .raku/EVAL for any data structure it supports.
[02:16:55] <japhb> (see https://github.com/japhb/serializer-perf for more details)
[03:19:54] <raydiak> Lua tables don't really distinguish between named and positional, it's all just a key lookup and positional is syntactic sugar. like our object hash, keys can be numbers or strings or whatever. as far as Lua functions go, there's no named params, you pass a table if you want to do that (at least in 5.1, when I learned it...don't think that's changed though)
[03:20:11] <raydiak> not very relevant, just FYI :)
[03:25:20] <raydiak> though now that I think about it like that...does CBOR::Simple support object hashes? you could theoretically just stuff the positional params into Int keys and the named into Str keys all in one hash. might be more compact. not sure about performance
[03:31:43] <raydiak> or maybe not more compact since you'd have to store the type of each key. idk, was just a thought

[10:40:09] <japhb> raydiak: Yeah, CBOR natively handles object hashes (anything can be a map key), and I believe I handled that right in CBOR::Simple.
[10:41:03] <japhb> CBOR is pretty good about compactness for a self-describing format.  It also compresses pretty well (well, as far as I've seen in experiments -- zstd seems to like it).
[10:41:50] <japhb> (Honestly, I took a chance learning CBOR because I needed something like it and was bewildered by the options, and after narrowing it down for a while I just followed my hunch ... and I'm pretty happy with the results so far.)

[13:06:17] <raydiak> I do remember it being quite extensive, read a lot about it when you first started with it (though I've forgotten a good portion of what I read by now). I'm sure it's suitable, I just meant storing a Capture as one map with different key types vs a map with all str keys and a separate array...not sure which would be better
