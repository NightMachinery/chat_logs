[04:05:35] <Cl0udSanta> oh man I worked at a place like that last year briefly

[04:05:42] <Cl0udSanta> they were a bunch of fucking weirdos
[04:06:10] <rpifan> of course if you only have 2 or 3 close friends they tend to get worn down really quickly
[04:06:15] <Cl0udSanta> they made me set these arbitrary goals, and when I was like 'whatever just let me work' they didnt really like that, so they made these weird goals like meeting people in the company and shit
[04:06:18] <rpifan> after all there is only so much one or two peopel can take at a time
[04:06:35] <rpifan> Cl0udSanta, well as long as you got free food and drink
[04:07:06] <Cl0udSanta> it does however mean that I have to drive near the office during rush hour
[04:07:14] <Cl0udSanta> soooooo
[04:08:24] <rpifan> bah
[04:08:33] <rpifan> there are things i miss about the us and things i hate about germany
[04:08:40] <rpifan> but the freedom to not drive is a great thing i couldnt do without
[04:08:47] <rpifan> i can hope on my bike and do everything
[04:08:53] <rpifan> and if im feeling sick or it's cold or im tired
[04:09:03] <Cl0udSanta> shits too far here lol
[04:09:10] <rpifan> i can just hop on the s-bahn u-bahn or high speed rail if i wanan go to another country
[04:09:21] <rpifan> i mean i can even get to morroco in just 2 days via land if i choose ot od so
[04:09:30] <Cl0udSanta> weedshop is like 5 miles away, the good liquor stores are 10+ away
[04:09:39] <rpifan> the morrocans built a  great new train all way down to the middle of their country
[04:09:59] <rpifan> yea i know some ppl who have moved to berlin but to the outskirts and im like wtf 
[04:10:23] <rpifan> id rather pay to live in a tiny cube and be able to get everything done then pay to live in a decent sized house but have to drive or take public transit everywhere
[04:10:29] <Cl0udSanta> I live 'in the city', but its basically all houses up to the weedshop
[04:10:33] <rpifan> in a sense living in the inner city has always been my dream / preferecen
[04:10:46] <rpifan> yea thats the disadvantage of american zoning
[04:10:52] <rpifan> even in ecuador everything is all mixed in
[04:10:52] <Cl0udSanta> if I can continue to WFH full time, all the time, I'm movin out to the boonies
[04:11:02] <rpifan> not me i live the city center
[04:11:05] <rpifan> love
[04:11:18] <rpifan> if anything berlin is not centric enough 
[04:11:28] <rpifan> even in the center of the city its quiet 
[04:13:54] <Cl0udSanta> its usually cheaper, get more space, and the things I'm really after (garage, back yard) are really hard to come by in the city, at least decently priced
[04:14:15] <Cl0udSanta> and more so for the boonies because I want to be able to see more than 1 or 2 stars every night
[04:16:33] <rpifan> well you need a garage cause you got a car and you need a car cuase you live in the boonies
[04:16:39] <rpifan> for the garden it's true that not easy to find
[04:16:51] <rpifan> although in germany they have some allotment gardens but they arent so popular
[04:17:08] <Cl0udSanta> no I want a garage so I have room to work on project cars :P
[04:17:09] <rpifan> i was hoping to volunteer at one of the few local ones but with covid its been uncertain
[04:17:19] <Cl0udSanta> and more than just 'livable' space for storing project work
[04:17:30] <rpifan> sure i cant shame you for having hobbies that need space
[04:17:41] <rpifan> i mean if i had enough space id just have my own gym
[04:18:02] <rpifan> but there is a benefit to leaving your house to go to the gym even tho im not a social person it is nice to move to a difference space
[04:18:11] <Cl0udSanta> if it werent for stupid zoning shit like 'you cant sleep in a warehouse', I'd absolutely rent a warehouse instead 
[04:18:17] <rpifan> even tho its often annoying to wait 20 minutes for the bar cuase the guy decicded to do 6 sets that daay
[04:18:31] <rpifan> warehouses are for partying not sleeping
[04:18:48] <Cl0udSanta> I mean, I'd only have a small portion for sleeping, but the rest would be project and workspace lol
[04:21:10] <Cl0udSanta> ...
[04:21:22] <Cl0udSanta> not one, but 2 amazon vans are dropping things off to two houses next to each other
[04:21:30] <rpifan> dj Cl0udSanta 
[04:21:46] <JollyRgrs> Cl0udSanta: they can't dock you for it if you just never sleep

[04:22:07] <Cl0udSanta> reminds me of The Machinist sorta lol
[04:23:02] <rpifan> man apparently london is currently warmer then berlin
[04:23:17] <rpifan> :thinkpad:
[04:23:30] <rpifan> i tried to look for slack icons from dilbert
[04:23:37] <rpifan> but apparently only dilbert himself is avaialbe as an icon
[04:24:02] <rpifan> the finance guy from my current job actually refererenced the finance trolls from dilbert so i wanted to add them

[11:57:03] <CptLuxx> that
[11:57:06] <CptLuxx> sounds wrong
[11:57:09] <Cl0udSanta> lmao
[11:57:11] <SirSantalot> I KNOW
[11:57:21] <SirSantalot> didn't want to be the one to point it out lol
[11:57:53] <CptLuxx> i know you ex soviets are into weird stuff DrZak
[11:57:55] <CptLuxx> but this..
[11:57:57] <Cl0udSanta> DrZak, yeah it was a really trying time for both me and my dog. hes does fantastic now though. he can be alone for up to 12 hours without a problem, loves people and people love him, still has problems with other dogs, its like 1/30 that get along. but hes big love and full of personality
[11:58:52] <SirSantalot> aggression towards other dogs?
[11:59:39] <Cl0udSanta> sorta. more like fear. we've been attacked 3 times by dogs who've jumped the fence while we were walking
[11:59:45] <DrZak> if its not socialized as a puppy ..
[12:00:20] <SirSantalot> ah ok, but it's not like he goes straight for random dogs you see?
[12:00:45] <Cl0udSanta> right. hes actually really weird with other dogs. he sits or lays down, but hes on edge the whole time
[12:01:18] <Cl0udSanta> its disappointing too because I'd love to take him to the dog park so he can run around, but theres always other dogs there
[12:01:41] <Cl0udSanta> instead I make sure he gets at least a good half block sprint in every other day or so
[12:01:56] <SirSantalot> can you let him off-leash?
[12:02:37] <Cl0udSanta> I wouldnt in a non-fenced area. he knows no leash means time to zoom and zooming boundaries are only known by walls and fences lol
[12:02:58] <SirSantalot> ditto here
[12:03:44] <Cl0udSanta> what kind of dog do you have anyway?
[12:04:02] <SirSantalot> munsterlander
[12:04:22] <SirSantalot> small munsterlander
[12:04:31] <SirSantalot> well, mixed breed

[12:06:08] <DrZak> :)) its nice
[12:06:34] <SirSantalot> sure does look like a chonkey boi
[12:07:22] <Cl0udSanta> hes only 75lbs

[12:10:08] <Cl0udSanta> thats a handsome pup
[12:10:47] <SirSantalot> bit more "normal" pic too, but the first one is more representative of his character :p
[12:11:21] <SirSantalot> did I ever tell you how I got him? it's a bit of a story too
[12:13:09] <SirSantalot> Wife and I were on holiday in italy, 2000km from home. We drove there with the van and motorcycle inside. We stayed at a campsite with our tent
[12:14:10] <SirSantalot> There were a bunch of strays there, and this one started hanging around our tent. He'd often just lay there when we got back from a day of motorcycling.
[12:14:26] <SirSantalot> we always put a bucket of water out for the dogs during those 2 weeks
[12:14:56] <SirSantalot> one night when going to sleep, I heard this little bastard settle in next to our tent. Usually he'd just run off and sleep wherever
[12:15:16] <SirSantalot> that night, I heard loud bangs in the distance and a lot of yelping and barking
[12:15:38] <SirSantalot> next day, not a single of the bunch of stray dogs were there, just this little guy that slept at our tent that night
[12:16:29] <SirSantalot> he had started following us when we went to the toilet and stuff then, and eventually I couldn't bear the thought of us driving off and him coming back to an empty campsite then
[12:16:43] <SirSantalot> so we just smuggled him across the borders illegally

[12:18:05] <DrZak> thats quite the story
[12:18:23] <SirSantalot> went to a vet the day after we got home to get him all his shots, started clicker training him right away
[12:18:56] <SirSantalot> so now he's a healthy, happy doggy. A LOT more relaxed than he was back in italy too, where he obviously had to fend for himself
[12:26:47] <Cl0udSanta> aww, he was totally lookin for someone to be with
[12:27:12] <SirSantalot> yeah, he basically adopted us
[12:27:25] <SirSantalot> and then made us do all the hard work :p

[14:16:06] <rpifan> there is a nice cider i had in stockholm
[14:16:10] <yuken> I didn't have a vessel appropriate for my hydrometer, but this thing _has_ to be 15-20%.
[14:16:29] <rpifan> if i must drink something that isnt strong alcohol i prefer a cider
[14:16:41] <rpifan> cant stand beer, except maybe for the occasional radler
[14:16:48] <rpifan> but even a german radler is quite strong
[14:17:53] <SirSantalot> wat
[14:18:10] <SirSantalot> isn't a radler specifically a light beer?
[14:18:22] <yuken> SirSantalot, my Dutch friend~
[14:18:26] <yuken> that was meant to be !
[14:18:28] <yuken> I am not flirting.
[14:18:32] <SirSantalot> lol
[14:19:05] <yuken> SirSantalot, my last batch of cider got me piss drunk off 450ml, and 900ml got me blackout. This batch is even stronger.
[14:19:08] <Riviera> yeah, i'd guess radler typically having between 2 and 3 % alcohol
[14:19:10] <yuken> granted I'm 50kg and have zero tolerance.
[14:19:24] <rpifan> noo
[14:19:33] <rpifan> radler just means bier mixed with sprite 
[14:19:35] <rpifan> can be any beer 
[14:19:46] <rpifan> and at my local schwul kneipe they always give you the strong stuff
[14:19:59] <rpifan> SirSantalot, you are dutch?
[14:20:16] <SirSantalot> yuken, half a liter of something around 15% @ 50kg does sound like something that could get you drunk
[14:20:16] <Riviera> can't really be any beer, no
[14:20:22] <teh_Gr1nch> yuken, that's not cider anymore

[14:21:49] <teh_Gr1nch> idk, but not cider

[14:25:18] <teh_Gr1nch> yuck

[22:39:41] <mistiry> we go in cycles. and i toss in others here and there too. rocket league. forza.
[22:41:56] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> RL is easily the most frustrating game I've every played. Solo queuing is dreadful. I'm doing well and winning when suddenly my teammate decides to go full retard and whiff every single attempt at playing the ball.
[22:42:21] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> I mean I can score goals, but if my team can't rotate or defend to save their life we lose.
[22:42:26] <mistiry> yeah i like to play with a group a lot more
[22:42:33] <mistiry> i dont play it solo too much
[22:42:47] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Also how am I in the same rank as these mouth breathers?
[22:43:18] <mistiry> i definitely get frustrated with shitty teaming 
[22:43:30] <mistiry> to me, randos always want to "be the star" instead of playing on a team
[22:43:40] <mistiry> so they chase and try to always be the one making shots etc
[22:43:47] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> For my personal fav is when you're lined up for a good open net shot and your teammate yeets you out of the way only to miss the shot.
[22:43:47] <mistiry> proper positioning and such be damned
[22:43:55] <sd> 07<S​trongBad> Y'all like poetry?
[22:44:04] <mistiry> there once was a man from nantucket

[22:44:25] <mistiry> he said with a grin

[23:03:31] <estranger> vinrock, that is great but im sure hte sales guys are annoyed cus new customers is commission

[23:10:17] <vinrock> theres a portion of the warehouse and outside lot that are reserved for transloading commodities from sea containers onto trailers and that side is busy to the point we almost can't stage any more trucks waiting to unload

[23:27:43] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> I do t even know what Kafka is, and yeah I did Google it lol
[23:27:44] <int0x1C8> more like kkkafkkka
[23:27:45] <estranger> most places arent ready for it
[23:28:12] <estranger> it's a data streaming platform... write your data to kafka and then anyone who needs that data grabs it from there... in short
[23:28:25] <estranger> and while the data is flowing through kafka you can act on it
[23:28:37] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> How does it differ from a database?
[23:28:39] <estranger> so, anything that is realtime you need something like that
[23:28:42] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Ok. Hm
[23:28:48] <SantasWiFi> but 
[23:28:54] <SantasWiFi> how do you avoid person B getting old data
[23:28:59] <SantasWiFi> if person A JUST submitted it
[23:29:07] <estranger> data is ordered 
[23:29:14] <estranger> you get the full stream
[23:29:15] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> I think I get it
[23:29:19] <SantasWiFi> thats neat
[23:29:30] <SantasWiFi> so when data is ordered do all the "nodes" ask around first?
[23:29:42] <SantasWiFi> and make sure they are up to date?
[23:29:51] <SantasWiFi> or am I greatly misunderstading this
[23:29:59] <estranger> well... your data stream is key'd so things are smart enough to go right to the correct node
[23:30:10] <estranger> you get ALL the data
[23:30:15] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Sounds fun
[23:30:22] <estranger> if you are doing adhoc lookups its prob a use case for a database
[23:30:33] <estranger> you still need a database but many things aren't suited for a database
[23:30:34] <SantasWiFi> ahh gotcha
[23:30:47] <int0x1C8> sounds a bit like rabbitmq
[23:30:51] <estranger> with a db you have to land the data.. then query it... and you dont always know what to query
[23:31:03] <estranger> with kafka you listen on the data stream and get what you need as it comes in
[23:31:07] <estranger> its the evolution of MQ
[23:31:27] <estranger> MQ you set point to point... so producers are tied to consumers
[23:31:41] <estranger> kafka you produce and dont care who consumes.. and many can comsume the same data
[23:31:41] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> How is the data in the stream? Is it like formatted in some certain way or does it support any type of data?
[23:32:09] <estranger> supports any type of data but you can apply a schema to it if you want
[23:32:21] <estranger> its like a db transaction log promoted to a first class citizen 
[23:33:05] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> What’s a common use case?
[23:33:28] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Trying to fully conceptualize it in my head
[23:33:49] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Like messaging?
[23:34:13] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> I wouldn't say evolution of MQ
[23:34:26] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> its a different approach to the problem

[23:34:58] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> like for work
[23:35:08] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> Kafka would just be a nucence to implement
[23:35:44] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> when we just need a tried and true method of pushing messages to a queue, doing some minor processing on them to order how they get assigned, and then popped from the stack by workers
[23:36:00] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> unlike our hacky doesn't work 20% of the time solutions

[23:36:55] <estranger> tim is awesome
[23:36:57] <int0x1C8> well I got a solution for that
[23:37:18] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> I can’t watch it now my plane Wi-Fi is shit
[23:37:24] <estranger> oh yeah
[23:37:25] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> @NinjaStyle there's a 100% need for a MQ service for something at work
[23:37:26] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> I’ll look later tho if I remember
[23:37:36] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> most likely rabbitMQ
[23:37:57] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> I’m certain we probably use some of this stuff on the product side
[23:38:18] <estranger> https://developer.confluent.io/what-is-apache-kafka/
[23:38:30] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> I think rabbitMQ can scan the request for keywords in the data blob
[23:38:31] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> if not
[23:38:42] <int0x1C8> it can yes
[23:38:42] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> I can have preprocessors do it and assign them to dynamic Queues

[23:40:20] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> so we get responses from an API that we're sending thousands of requests a minute to, and RabbitMQ can hold the response while the servers churn through, and based on the response (it'll always have a unique ID and timestamp) feed it to the server that was processing it
[23:40:27] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> tehnically I don't need the same server
[23:40:30] <estranger> when you get into event driven architecture something like kafka is key... when you dont know who all needs your events.. if a new app comes online you dont have to change anything with your producers or kafka, they just subscribe in
[23:40:37] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> it just needs to be processed linearly
[23:40:44] <estranger> also kafka keeps state durably .. another difference 
[23:40:59] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> you can do state retainment in RabbitMQ I thought
[23:41:06] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> just not by default
[23:41:12] <estranger> doesnt it go away once its acknowledged?
[23:41:22] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> no I think that's a setting
[23:41:56] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> it'll reassign the queue item if it doesn't recive an acklowedgement of completion from the computer that picked it up
[23:42:22] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> I bet we use this
[23:42:23] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> this is a year old memory though
[23:42:37] <estranger> yeah so when you setup a queue you kinda need to know who wants the data.. if you need say 12 people consuming the same data you need 12 queues ? or has that changed too
[23:42:57] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> you can have multiple consumers per queue afaik
[23:43:02] <int0x1C8> there's multiple types of queues
[23:43:04] <estranger> MQ is fast cus its all in memory but cant do the same level of throughput 
[23:43:18] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> I don't need insane throughput
[23:43:23] <estranger> yeah
[23:43:27] <int0x1C8> and yes consumers to producers is many to many
[23:43:32] <estranger> thousands per minute is tiny 
[23:43:34] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> 4000 messages/min isn't a whole lot
[23:43:41] <estranger> 4000/sec isnt many
[23:43:50] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> especially when that only lasts for 15min
[23:44:13] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> and that 15min is because the one server processing them is overloaded and the SQL server is overloaded too

[23:44:25] <estranger> customer this week said he was doing 93M/sec heh
[23:44:37] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> I could recode this to be serverless
