[00:01:10] <huf> that is the color of energy drink :D
[00:01:10] <blkshp> RED BULL.
[00:01:11] <blkshp> YES!
[00:01:18] <blkshp> I don't drink that but i do remember it
[00:01:43] <huf> I used to drink a lot of it until my stomach said no more
[00:02:07] <blkshp> I was a Monster monster.
[00:02:08] <pussipupu> ah Jäger bombs
[00:02:19] <pussipupu> because you're twelve
[00:02:23] <huf> eh
[00:02:32] <huf> never liked those toothpaste type drinks
[00:02:38] <pussipupu> I was already too old and grumpy for monster when it came out
[00:02:42] <huf> vodka + burn was nice
[00:02:47] <huf> but burn was purple/red flavored
[00:02:47] <blkshp> Jager was great, after you were already dwunkish
[00:02:50] <huf> and that's always better than yellow

[03:45:40] <StayHungry> as a consequence of not keeping distance and staying away from vaccines?
[03:51:47] <CuriosTiger> Yep, and also as a consequence of lots of Americans vacationing in Florida over the summer.

[03:55:25] <StayHungry> (it's a play by Aleksandr Pushkin)
[03:58:45] <StayHungry> whereas Giovanni Boccaccio (14th-century Italian author) provides another way to spend such time in his 'Decameron', which is a collection of tales told by 7 women and 3 men, who locked themselves outside Florence in order to escape the Black Death, which was afflicting the city.

[19:23:18] <Oleg> This article ( https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/nyregion/nyc-vaccine-mandate.html ) states: "Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Tuesday morning that New York City will require proof of vaccination for people participating in indoor activities, including at restaurants, gyms and performances, his latest attempt to spur more vaccinations."
[19:23:52] <Oleg> Why was the word "will" used in the sentence, instead of "would"?

[19:27:25] <Oleg> so, the sentences "I thought you would do it" and "I thought you will do it" mean two different things?
[19:27:44] <kurahaupo> Oleg: the latter didn't make much sense
[19:28:05] <kurahaupo> or rather, the latter is missing quotes
[19:28:20] <ksft> "would" is two different things
[19:28:37] <kurahaupo> I said you would do it. I said "you will do it"
[19:28:48] <ksft> Wiktionary lists it as "Past tense of will" and "A modal verb, the subjunctive of will"
[19:29:04] <pussipupu> English has a rather messy tense/mood model
[19:29:17] <ksft> if the word "would" were substituted for "will" in Oleg's example, I would read it with the first meaning
[19:29:26] <pussipupu> Compared to the literally one other language I kinda know :p
[19:29:35] <Oleg> kurahaupo: but as you can see, that NYT article uses the "announced/will" combination.
[19:29:40] <ksft> the requiring is in the future relative to some point in the past
[19:29:50] <ksft> that point in the past is the announcement
[19:30:07] <ksft> so he said "NYC will require proof"
[19:30:08] <kurahaupo> Think and announce have different implications

[19:38:22] <kurahaupo> Oleg: It's common to imply the quotes when writing "say" or "announce"; but since "think" doesn't normally take a quotes phrase, it just seems weird instead
[19:38:40] * LuisP14 wonders why the association with announced

[19:43:43] <kurahaupo> To make sense of it, when the mayor announces something, "they" refers to the same organisation that the mayor is a mouthpiece for. When someone thinks that "they" will do Y, then that implies that they don't know it for sure, so that means "they" must refer to a disconnected entity

[19:45:07] <kurahaupo> Whereas if the mayor thought that the city would do something, that's telling about a firm plan (which might have gone awry since)
[19:45:35] <ksft> maybe he isn't sure what policy he'll implement yet
[19:46:23] <ksft> his plan at the time of the thinking was that the city would require vaccines at some point after we're reading it
[19:46:34] <ksft> it seems analogous to me

[19:48:28] <ksft> he wasn't sure yet, but he thought they were going to do it two days later, which is now tomorrow
[19:48:58] <ksft> or maybe he did miss the meeting
[19:49:35] <kurahaupo> Actually the more I think about this, the less happy I am with any "yesterday A did B that C will D" construction
[19:50:12] <ksft> for me, it's bad with "thought" but fine with "announced"
[19:50:21] <kurahaupo> It only seems valid when B is a verb conveying information

[19:56:24] <kurahaupo> The "rule of conveyance" (as I shall call this) applies in other situations as well. Converting a transitive phrase with an indirect "to" object to a bitransitive phrase only works for conveyance verbs
[19:58:22] <ksft> I don't think I understand
[19:58:32] <kurahaupo> "give the book to me" → "give me the book" [good]

[19:58:47] <ksft> sure, that one makes sense
[19:58:58] <ksft> "to bed" is an adjunct, but "to me" is a complement
[19:58:59] <kurahaupo> the latter is a navigational instruction, not a postal instruction

[21:23:36] <kurahaupo> In terms of vaccinations, the elderly are (unusually) not disadvantaged (in most places) because the people giving the vaccines know they're the most vulnerable and so prioritise them
[21:24:26] <kurahaupo> Which means "the lowest" would convey exactly the wrong meaning
[21:31:51] <kurahaupo> If by some quirk that were not true, and the article wanted to highlight that they would probably have written something like "Among XYZ, people over 70 have the lowest vaccination rates of their communities. Health officials are surprised and dismayed by this result."
[21:33:38] <kurahaupo> Whereas the tautological "you're disadvantaged if you're disadvantaged" is sad, unfair, and obvious.

[22:40:23] <blkshp> You should stay away from "ladies and gentlemen" these days.
[22:40:44] <bin> "Ladies and gentlemen, non-ladies and non-gentlemen"
[22:40:49] <StayHungry> CuriosTiger: i mean is 'how do thou feel today' fine or 'thou' should be changed for something?

[22:41:04] <bin> Friends is too familiar.

[22:41:33] <StayHungry> bin: i'm exploring other possibilities, from good old days
[22:41:41] <CuriosTiger> StayHungry: So in Middle English, that would've been How dost thou feel today. In Modern English, "How do you feel today" is the only option using a pronoun.
[22:41:50] <StayHungry> CuriosTiger: aha! thanks
[22:42:02] <CuriosTiger> In overly polite circles, such as a butler addressing a master, workarounds are used. "How does Sir feel today?"
[22:42:17] <CuriosTiger> but even that sounds silly in regular conversation.
[22:42:23] <Oleg> CuriosTiger: in Modern English, we still say "holier-than-thou attitude".
[22:42:40] <bin> Oleg: yeah but it's largely idiomatic these days
[22:42:59] <CuriosTiger> We do, but that is an example of a set phrase. "thou" is also used in some very specific context, such as quoting Bible scripture.
[22:43:08] <CuriosTiger> But it's not used (non-sarcastically, anyway) in regular conversation.
[22:43:11] <TechTest> blkshp: no worries, I will tell you the rest in PM

[22:46:34] <CuriosTiger> But yes, in my opinion, if you're going to use an archaic pronoun for dramatic effect, you should use verb conjugations from the same time period.
[22:46:57] <CuriosTiger> anything else looks anachronistic. In reality, that distinction is probably lost on most people, as the average person is not going to be familiar with Middle English grammar.

[22:51:06] <bin> CuriosTiger: to me the most primary example of Middle English is Chaucer but the vocabulary is slightly different as well as spelling, which is why I'm not sure that sentence would be spelled the same way

[22:51:14] <bin> and it might be anachronistic without the spelling
[22:51:43] <Babar> when it is referring to my personal skill at the use of the language, it would still be capitalised?
[22:52:16] <Babar> (i.e. "my english" rather than "the English language")
[22:52:27] <bin> iirc (and I haven't looked it up so don't quote me) Shakespeare is considered early modern and he used dost and thou
[22:52:32] <blkshp> Yes, it would.
[22:52:36] <CuriosTiger> bin: I think both qualify. It's hard to define hard boundaries, but Middle English (according to Wikipedia's definition, at any rate) spanned about five centuries. It changed considerably in that time.
[22:53:06] <bin> yeah fair
[22:53:56] <CuriosTiger> bin: If I had a little more time, I'd take a closer look at pronoun usage in the Canterbury Tales -- but right now I just dropped in for a minute. Perhaps tonight. I would not be surprised to see Chaucer's usage differ from what the Wikipedia article on Middle English pronouns lists.
[22:54:36] <pussipupu> We should totally revive "thou" and the singular second-person personal pronouns
[22:54:37] <pussipupu> But also adopt a new third-person personal pronouns
[22:55:42] <bin> CuriosTiger: yeah it was just a passing thought moreso than anything with the spelling of certain words
[22:55:55] <bin> it's not clear to me where the distinction is between middle and early modern
[22:56:11] <pussipupu> s, pronouns, pronoun,
[22:56:32] <CuriosTiger> bin: One additional point there is that up through the invention of the printing press, spelling varied by extreme amounts, even between authors from the same time period. It was much more closely tied to pronunciation than it is today, to the point of reflecting dialectal variation.
[22:56:44] <bin> veryu true
[22:56:50] <kurahaupo> pussipupu: Clearly we don't have enough complexity. We need not just plural but dual as well
[22:57:01] <CuriosTiger> bin: In my mind, the two characteristics that I look at are the loss of grammatical case and the great vowel shift.
[22:57:07] <CuriosTiger> but of course, those two things didn't happen overnight either.
[22:57:24] <bin> no, but it's a good point tbh and a good place to make the distinction
[22:57:32] <pussipupu> You always say that and I still disagree :p
[22:57:32] <bin> I'm certainly not a linguist nor do I pretend to be
[22:57:39] <bin> well a hobbyist one, maybe
[22:57:42] <kurahaupo> And first-person-present vs first-person-absent
[22:57:47] <CuriosTiger> I consider myself a hobbyist linguist.
[22:57:54] <pussipupu> We could strip number from the grammar entirely though if you'd like
[22:57:55] <CuriosTiger> in the sense that I find the subject interesting and want to learn more. :)
[22:58:09] <CuriosTiger> pussipupu: Chinese does. Korean mostly does.
[22:58:22] <bin> I mostly enjoy just dabbling and going down random rabbit holes with odd sources lmao
[22:58:26] <StayHungry> pussipupu: 'we should totally revive thou'... yeah, using English without 2nd person pronoun is a bit counter-intuitive as my native language has it :)
[22:58:36] <pussipupu> a distinction between inclusive and exclusive "we" if we're keeping number would be nice though
[22:58:56] <CuriosTiger> Almost all languages distinguish between singular and plural pronouns. English dropping its second person singular is a bit of an oddball in that respect.
[22:59:16] <pussipupu> CuriosTiger: yeah lots of languages don't have number
[22:59:20] <CuriosTiger> Of course, Latin American Spanish dropped its second person PLURAL pronouns, so it's not entirely unheard of.
[22:59:54] <pussipupu> second-person plurals used for politeness marking dominating makes just-so sense at least
[23:00:19] <Oleg> CuriosTiger: "you" can't be singular, but it can still be either collective or non-collective.
[23:00:20] <CuriosTiger> And in Korean, while there is a word for "my", the word for "our" is often substituted. To the point that someone will say "our mother" to mean his mother.
[23:00:22] <pussipupu> Though Finnish does that (a bit) and hasn't lost the singular
[23:00:28] <StayHungry> CuriosTiger: 2nd person plural? like 'you, the group who came and listen to me right now, behold'? 
[23:00:37] <CuriosTiger> Oleg: You absolutely can be singular.
[23:01:01] <CuriosTiger> StayHungry: Yeah. "vosotros".
[23:01:13] <kurahaupo> Really we should just have a constructive grammar for pronouns: me, thee, theeme, he, heme, hethee, hetheeme, she, sheme,… shehe, … 
[23:01:36] <StayHungry> sheme :D
[23:01:52] <Oleg> CuriosTiger: what do you mean? in some situations, it would be grammatically correct to say "you was", instead of "you were"?
[23:01:56] <CuriosTiger> I think we should skip pronouns altogether and instead introduce tones on the verb to indicate the subject and object. :)
[23:02:05] *** Quits: gre (~tre@148.252.133.10) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:02:18] <CuriosTiger> Oleg: "You were" is a perfectly valid SINGULAR form. "were" does not necessarily indicate a plural.
[23:02:40] <pussipupu> Simply inflecting a single pronoun for number, person and personhood (and maybe proximity)?
[23:02:46] <CuriosTiger> (For that matter, in the subjunctive, you find "I were" as well, without that turning the speaker into multiple people.)
[23:02:47] <Oleg> CuriosTiger: isn't being singular not the same thing as non-collective?
[23:02:59] <pussipupu> kurahaupo: I am fascinated by your ideas and would like to subscribe to your newsletter
[23:03:15] <StayHungry> Oleg: that 'were' after 'you' when singular is meant is a bit confusing, indeed :)
[23:03:17] <CuriosTiger> Oleg: I don't know what you mean by "non-collective". Your own statement implies you consider the two separate concepts.
[23:04:07] <CuriosTiger> In English grammar, we distinguish between singular pronouns -- I, you, he, she it -- and plural pronouns -- we, you they.
[23:04:25] <CuriosTiger> Confusingly, you can be both singular and plural. In some instances, so can they -- usually when you need a gender-neutral way to refer to a single person.
[23:04:46] <CuriosTiger> For example, "I'm getting a new roommate today, but I don't know when they get here."
[23:05:13] <twb> What's the origin of "fight the good fight" ?
[23:05:56] <Oleg> CuriosTiger: English still distinguishes between "yourself" and "yourselves", despite dropping "thou".
[23:06:22] <CuriosTiger> Yes, it does.
[23:06:24] <TechTest> why have pronouns become such big of a deal?
[23:06:27] <CuriosTiger> I'm not sure how that relates to thou.
[23:06:35] <CuriosTiger> TechTest: Because non-binary gender has become a big deal.
[23:06:49] <TechTest> right
[23:07:12] <TechTest> suddenly only languages are wrong 
[23:07:19] <CuriosTiger> (And while I intend no offense to anyone, I am having a bit of a hard time wrapping my head around that concept.)
[23:07:21] <TechTest> s/only/all
[23:07:21] <tinsoldier> T​echTest meant: suddenly all languages are wrong
[23:07:34] <CuriosTiger> TechTest: Languages change to adapt to the needs of people.
[23:07:42] <LjL> not all, i guess, since there are languages with gender-neutral pronouns already, like Finnish
[23:07:49] <CuriosTiger> As new concepts are introduced, we need new words -- and sometimes new grammar -- to deal with them.
[23:08:10] <TechTest> CuriosTiger: I actually think that's a very big change for any language to adapt
[23:08:17] <CuriosTiger> In my native Norway, they've recently made a big deal of renaming a whole bunch of positions that had gender-specific titles.
[23:08:35] <LjL> TechTest, especially in languages where gender is much more extensive than english
[23:08:36] <TechTest> the English language may adapt, but in some language even plural is gendered
[23:08:44] <TechTest> LjL: yeah
[23:09:02] <CuriosTiger> German comes to mind.
[23:09:09] <TechTest> actually in my language even nouns are gendered, so I really can't imagine how that would change 
[23:09:16] <CuriosTiger> (not for gendered plurals, but for more extensive use of gender in general)
[23:09:28] <CuriosTiger> TechTest: Which language is that?
[23:09:28] <LjL> i'm not a fan of *mobbing* people to change their language when they're just using it the way everyone was using it before the gender-enlightment, fwiw.
[23:09:52] *** Quits: ralinux (~saje@37.156.188.75) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:09:58] <CuriosTiger> LjL: Me neither. I find that shoehorning in newly invented pronouns like s/he and hir feels very unnatural.
[23:10:13] <LjL> in languages with grammatical genders, gendered nouns may be the least of issues: adjectives can't really be de-gendered when you're saying "i'm <adjective>" for example
[23:10:17] <bin> death to neopronouns. 
[23:10:19] <CuriosTiger> but perhaps I'm just an old geezer by now.
[23:10:19] <TechTest> the work "teacher" for example has two forms, the end of the word is different depending whether you are referring to a male or a female teacher
[23:10:23] <TechTest> CuriosTiger: Greek
[23:10:24] <blkshp> He, she or they probably don't agree
[23:10:28] <blkshp> example sentence.
[23:10:45] <LjL> (adjectives, and also past tenses of verbs in my language for instance! you can't say "i have gone" without basically "giving away" your gender)
[23:10:49] <bin> I've begrudgingly accepted singular "they" but it bothers me when it's ambiguous like a group photo.
[23:11:03] <TechTest> blkshp: try say that in Greek
[23:11:24] <CuriosTiger> Spanish does that too. Like Estoy cansado if you're male, but Estoy cansada if you're female.
[23:11:30] *** Quits: fweht (uid404746@id-404746.tooting.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[23:11:44] <TechTest> LjL: that's in my language too, so the issue isn't just the pronouns
[23:11:53] <LjL> CuriosTiger, yes, just not with past tenses since that's thankfully limited to "haber" as auxiliary
[23:12:13] <blkshp> nefvjnio3uht9oeovhb3 
[23:12:26] <TechTest> you are right
[23:12:33] <LjL> everyone log into blkshp's account
[23:12:48] <CuriosTiger> Thai ends just about every sentence with "khrup" (male speaker) or "ka" (female speaker)
[23:12:55] <pussipupu> I'd rather not
[23:12:55] <TechTest> I wouldn't want to be blkshp for a day
[23:12:56] <blkshp> Seems that Google translate doesn't copy that
[23:12:59] <TechTest> or even an gour

[23:13:23] <CuriosTiger> I wouldn't want to be mistaken for a bleak shop.
[23:13:34] <TechTest> or a black sheep
[23:13:45] <CuriosTiger> you think that's what he meant
[23:13:46] <CuriosTiger> ?

[23:13:52] <StayHungry> ! begrudgingly
[23:13:55] <kurahaupo> CuriosTiger: We did the same role renaming thing back in the 70's and 80's. Out with "chairman", in with "chairperson" (later, out with "chairperson" and in with just "chair"). A few have survived on etymological grounds; an ombudsman isn't an ombudsperson - usually
[23:13:59] <StayHungry> !w begrudgingly
[23:14:00] <tinsoldier> begrudgingly — Adverb: 1. In a begrudging manner; in a manner that is envious or reluctant. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/begrudgingly
[23:14:18] <TechTest> CuriosTiger: I'm sure about it
[23:14:19] <CuriosTiger> kurahaupo: Ombudsman was borrowed from Norwegian, and they are now changing it to simply "ombud".
[23:15:03] <kurahaupo> We might change it as well. I note that my swipe keyboard already knows how to spell ombudsperson
[23:15:12] <CuriosTiger> I mean, we've had some of it in English too. Stewardesses are now flight attendants
[23:15:21] <CuriosTiger> not sure what's going to happen to midhusbands though
[23:15:31] <bin> nobody wants that
[23:15:32] <LuisP14> "you" came to be the singular pronoun only because of its use as a polite marker :x
[23:16:12] <StayHungry> one day those gender-neutrality obsessed folks will ban Seal's great song 'It's a man's man's man's world' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOvKal4nhU0 
[23:16:17] <kurahaupo> Those would be the men looking after the husbands who faint whole their wives are giving birth?
[23:16:25] <kurahaupo> *while
[23:16:27] * blkshp has successfully changed his freenode password lol
[23:16:53] <CuriosTiger> kurahaupo: Those are just husbands. Midhusbands are the counterpart to midwives. :P
[23:17:03] <bin> the idea of a male doula gives me the heebiejeebies. 
[23:17:05] * CuriosTiger points out that we're on Libera
[23:17:24] <LuisP14> and then 'man' being already gender neautral in the distant past :x
[23:17:26] <blkshp> I know, i was just testing logging into the freenode webaccess
[23:17:36] <CuriosTiger> I don't go to FreeNode anymore.

[23:17:53] <kurahaupo> homus vs virus in Latin
[23:17:56] <CuriosTiger> When they dropped all the nick and channel registrations was the point where I decided they were not worth the bother.
[23:17:58] <blkshp> down to fewer than 12k users.
[23:18:17] <CuriosTiger> I'm surprised they have that many
[23:18:23] <CuriosTiger> Most are probably bots.
[23:18:27] <TechTest> damn and I was looking forward your nick to drop so I can register it and be blkshp of blkshp 
[23:18:30] <kurahaupo> I've taken freenode off my autoconnect list
[23:18:43] <TechTest> I'm banned from freenode

[23:19:08] <kurahaupo> I suppose I should go check on "the old ##English". BRB
[23:19:13] <TechTest> twb: it's stills there, I'm just banned :P
[23:19:15] <StayHungry> kurahaupo: some channels still not fully migrated such as #imagemagick, so freenode is not gone entirely yet
[23:19:36] <twb> The foul thing that now wears its skin should not be spoken of.
[23:20:24] <CuriosTiger> twb: Couldn't agree more.

[23:25:21] <LjL> you need to be registered now to join freenode
[23:25:31] <StayHungry> alas, moving to libera with its inspiring guidelines didn't affect migrated channels. some of them are still ruled questionably. as if the dictator we were running from had infiltrated current ranks. but let's focus on a positive side, ##english is still the same in a good way :)
[23:26:10] <blkshp> They're not ruled questionably
[23:26:16] <blkshp> They're ruled
[23:26:30] <blkshp> It's not a democracy
[23:27:13] <blkshp> It's an oligarchy.
[23:27:45] <twb> ##india was free of racists for nearly a whole two weeks
[23:28:21] <LuisP14> racist against who?

[23:28:48] <LuisP14> :x
[23:28:57] <StayHungry> blkshp: our rules, for example, say that code of conduct takes precedence, that code suits me. it goes hand in hand with what's happening on the ground here, but when you come to #.... it contradicts.
[23:29:03] <twb> The people running ##india on Freenode believe that China wants to kill everyone in india and steal their land, and have alreayd started kidnapping people on the border
[23:29:32] <twb> When libera happened, someone else created a new ##india.  Then after a few weeks, they were kicked out and the original mob turned up with ops
[23:29:59] <twb> The new place moved to ##bharat but then dried up
[23:30:07] <StayHungry> twb: mob :D
[23:30:19] <LuisP14> well
[23:30:26] <twb> StayHungry: in my dialect that just means "community"

[23:32:06] <TechTest> I think aliens want to kidnap everyone

[23:44:06] <twb> blkshp: "bagh" is any large cat (by default, a tiger)
[23:44:17] <pussipupu> It only looks for definitions listed as English

[23:52:22] * blkshp gets the cheetah a pet pussipupu
[23:52:32] <StayHungry> CuriosTiger: or, if it is know for sure that 'roommate' is one of 'fragile and flammable' kind then we could still find a way to agree in number: 'I'm getting a new roommate today, but I don't know when the person gets here.' being a conservative non-native i'm more concerned about grammatical agreement then that masculine/feminine equality extremes.
[23:53:03] <pussipupu> better, and more accurately represents the power dynamic at play
[23:53:28] <pussipupu> "I'm getting a new roommate but don't know when they'll arrive" is perfectly good English
[23:53:33] <blkshp> Just not one from the Island of Dr Maureau
[23:54:17] <StayHungry> pussipupu: perhaps my kids will get it, but not me. in first part you talk about 1 human being, then suddenly switch to plural.
[23:54:37] <blkshp> they is not necessarily plural.
[23:54:47] <StayHungry> i know, but i can't accept it
[23:54:52] <pussipupu> grammatical number doesn't necessarily match semantic number
[23:54:52] <blkshp> Well you have to.
[23:54:57] <blkshp> it's not a difficult premise
[23:55:23] <pussipupu> to trot out the obvious example yet again, "you" is grammatically plural
[23:55:37] <blkshp> Youze!
[23:55:42] <StayHungry> i don't argue, just use other options that are also grammatically correct.
[23:55:46] <blkshp> Why?
[23:55:50] <blkshp> Stubbornness?
[23:56:03] <blkshp> Objection to things that really shouldn't be objected to?
[23:56:13] <StayHungry> agreement in number as i said
[23:56:52] <blkshp> I must have missed something.
[23:57:48] <pussipupu> those are different clauses, and the subjects agree with the verbs which is the number agreement that English grammar has
[23:59:30] <twb> pussipupu: personally I find "roommate" confusing for people who have separate bedrooms
[23:59:36] <twb> pussipupu: we say "flatmate"
[23:59:44] <pussipupu> ok
