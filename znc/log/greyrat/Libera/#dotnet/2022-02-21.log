[23:01:34] <MagnusRM> i am used to the old .net framework. Now when I work with .net core adding references seems to be different and there is something called dependencies, under which you find packages.
[23:01:37] <MagnusRM> Anyone knows some good site that explains the differences?
[23:19:30] <MatthiasVance> Should visit the #csharp channel for everything .NET really
[23:19:58] <MagnusRM> ah ok, thanks, will do that (tomorrow, need to go here now)
