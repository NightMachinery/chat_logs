[03:36:44] <kurahaupo> Babar: Whether "alternative" vs "alternate" mean the same or not depends on the dialect. In my dialect "alternative" means one of a number of (backup or other) options, while "alternate" means "to switch between alternatives" (back and forth for two alternatives, or in rotation for more than two).
[03:36:45] <kurahaupo> Babar: In particular, "alternative days" just means "other days" (when something might happen), whereas "alternate days" means the sequence Monday Wednesday Friday Sunday Tuesday Thursday Saturday Mondayâ€¦

[15:29:33] <paranoid_bLues> can we use "stay in a corner" to explain the situation "not getting the attention it/they deserves"
[15:29:46] <paranoid_bLues> is it a idiom?
[15:29:54] <paranoid_bLues> *an*
[15:29:55] <blkshp> Not one I've heard of.
[15:30:49] <paranoid_bLues> what can i use to explain "not getting the attention it/they deserves"?
[15:31:13] <blkshp> It depends on the scenario.
[15:32:14] <paranoid_bLues> "My lover has taken by other adn i stayed in corner???"
[15:32:37] <paranoid_bLues> what do you recoomend instead of "stay in corner"?
[15:32:39] <blkshp> Sorry, that means nothing to me.
[15:32:46] <blkshp> What do you mean by it?
[15:33:13] <blkshp> "did nothing about it" "Buried my head in the sand" 
[15:34:19] <paranoid_bLues> the full concept is that : his lover has taken by others and he is alone now
[15:35:12] <blkshp> Well then you have the sentence you want there!
[15:35:57] <paranoid_bLues> it doesn't meet full context
[15:36:06] <paranoid_bLues> Ä°2m a freelance translator btw
[15:36:25] <paranoid_bLues> anyone knows Turkish here?
[15:36:33] <blkshp> Ok then. Stayed in a corner is not an idiom. It doesn't mean anything don't use it.
[15:36:45] <paranoid_bLues> ok thk u blkshp
[15:36:57] <blkshp> And if you're a translator, don't talk like that
[15:37:22] <blkshp> PLEASE!
[15:38:10] <paranoid_bLues> what is wrong?
[15:38:26] <paranoid_bLues> oh ok
[15:38:29] <blkshp> May I be honest, only in order to assist you with your translating?
[15:38:41] <paranoid_bLues> of course
[15:38:50] <blkshp> NEVER FUCKING SAY "U" :D!
[15:39:20] <blkshp> EVER, for any reason other than a part of a word, it is not a word as a whole and it's extremely irritating to some (including me) lol
