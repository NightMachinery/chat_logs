[00:18:16] <rdbeni0> tag:unread is just... unread? or tag:new ?
[00:19:42] <rdbeni0> sorry for my stupid questions, but i am fresh "notmuch" user (i used thunderbird since 10 years and changed it 4 days ago)

[00:30:29] <bremner> tag:new is not special according to notmuch. tag:unread is optionally synched with the maildir unread status
[00:30:58] <bremner> people define various workflows involving tag:new, but notmuch doesn't do anything special compared to any other tag

[00:41:28] <rdbeni0> ok. thanks. So let's say i have entry like that:
[00:41:30] <rdbeni0> https://i.imgur.com/thp0DSu.png
[00:42:07] <rdbeni0> and if i click it
[00:42:09] <rdbeni0> and then
[00:42:21] <rdbeni0> notmuch-refresh-all-buffers
[00:42:55] <rdbeni0> then the red tag "unread" will disappear
[00:43:23] <rdbeni0> it means that it has been just synchronized with maildir status?
[00:45:03] <rdbeni0> or just in "notmuch" this tag:unread just disappeared
[00:49:29] <rdbeni0> as i understand, +unread is just a normal tag
[00:52:34] <bremner> it's probably less confusing if you first understand what happens when you run "notmuch tag -unread id:$yourid"
[00:53:01] <bremner> that syncs with maildir status right away.
[00:54:21] <bremner> the emacs interface is just running commands for you, but it tries to keep the display updated. So when you read a message with default settings, you should see a line through the unread tag, indicating it has been removed.
[01:00:51] <rdbeni0> "you should see a line through the unread tag, indicating it has been removed." - It is true. I just noticed it

[02:36:32] <rdbeni0> is there smart possibility to replace tag:attachment with tag:at in the config file? or i need : notmuch tag +at -attachment -- tag:attachment
[02:36:46] <rdbeni0> what is the best approach to change "attachment" with "at"

[21:29:06] <bremner> nothing inconsistent with my statement there.
[21:31:47] <bremner> it's just that "before notmuch 1.0" might not be a very strong constraint.

[23:49:51] <bremner> I guess I basically don't use contacts, just address completion.
[23:50:06] <bremner> iirc, some people do use bbdb with notmuch.
[23:50:34] <bremner> in principle most things that work with gnus will probably work with notmuch
[23:50:48] <acdw> mm that's good to know
[23:51:20] <acdw> i honestly don't even use email that that much /yet/ with emacs; i'm looking also for ways to insert a contact into my org-complete workflow
[23:51:25] <acdw> maybe i'm doing too much...
