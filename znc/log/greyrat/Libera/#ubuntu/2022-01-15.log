[00:01:19] <deadmund> I am looking for a program that can convert a postscript / eps file into a png or gif or some other "normal" image format.  I found https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man1/psconvert.1gmt.html  but the package gmt-common does not seem to provide that command for me on my system.  What am I doing wrong?
[00:01:32] <deadmund> apt-file show gmt-common | grep psconvert     outputs nothing?

[03:03:54] <toxic0> jhutchins oh yes I use opnSense and it already has CARP for itself, but I'm trying to have a failover for my main reverse-proxy behind the opnSense box, and they are 2 ubuntu lxc containers running on different pve hosts
[03:04:38] <toxic0> I was not able to imagine a way where opnSense would check for port 443 being open on one of the ip of the reverse-proxy and assigning the first one in the pool to some VIP
[03:06:00] <toxic0> don't think it can be transparent like that for the lxc containers, if they have no idea they are master or not they don't know if they should answer to the VIP or not and probably the IP stack would drop these packets that are to the VIP

[14:39:32] <philip0> Hello, it's my first install of ubuntu, and I selected to use Secure Boot and gave a password to enroll keys. On boot I was presented with a MOK management interface and it was not clear what to do. System now boots without third party firmware active (eg NVIDIA-SMI has failed because it could not communicate with the NVIDIA driver. How do I re-do
[14:39:33] <philip0> the key signing step and do it successfully? Docs seem to be not detailed on this.

[17:31:25] <coz_> philip0, out of curiosity, which were the other 3?
[17:33:50] <philip0> 1. Fedora 35 Scientific worked the best on the live USB. First update was almost 1G and resulted in a borked system with both GUI and virtual terminals inaccessible.
[17:34:25] <coz_> interesting
[17:34:42] *** Joins: src (~src@user/src)
[17:36:21] <philip0> 2. Debian worked well on the live USB, except the high resolution monitor was not supported, which did not interfere with the installation. The installation resulted in a system where the bluetooth was being started and stopped about twice a second. So workable but with a daemon keeping the system warmer than necessary.

[17:44:39] <philip0> recent firefox eats RAM like never before.

[17:53:06] *** oerheks_ is now known as oerheks
[17:53:06] <ravage> and the system is maybe 2 years old now. i still feel better on a fresh installation somehow
[17:55:00] <coz_> ravage, this is my prefernce, a clean install eliminates doubts
[17:55:01] <tomreyn> with some releases, there are some hard facts which make it worthwhile to do a fresh install, such as newer file systems on /, increased /boot file system size (if separate), newer LUKS encryption, ZFS etc.
[17:55:06] <_srp> er... I have / and /home mounted on different partitions. So a reinstall in my / partition shouldn't touch the .config files, right?
[17:55:43] <ravage> it should not if you make the right choices during setup. but keeping /home keeps all the bloat :)
[17:55:59] <tomreyn> _srp: as long as you can ensure that /home remains untouched, yes. but ... have backups.
[17:56:12] <ravage> maybe rename your user directory and start with a fresh user
[17:56:18] <ravage> and copy over what you need
[17:56:20] <oerheks> I would do both; upgrade and fresh install

[19:26:18] <transhumanist> whats the trick for finding old kernels ... the location old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux/ doesnt group individual files that go with one kernel together, they are spread all over the place. I am looking for all the files associated with kernel 5.6.8-x , thanks in advance

[19:29:10] <leftyfb> transhumanist: mind you, anything in old-releases is EOL and not supported
[19:29:39] <transhumanist> ok a different question how do i find out which kernel version has a particular working module
[19:30:27] <leftyfb> transhumanist: "working". Is there a bug report that shows ipusb doesn't work on any modern or supported kernels or are you just going by your own personal experience?

[21:54:37] <Guest2027> That's what I gather, that Windows should be using FAT32, but no. Maybe it's because I "installed" Windows by migrating it from a HDD using Samsunsg's data migration tool (new Samsung SSD).

[21:56:09] <Guest2027> I did think more than one EFI on the same drive may be trouble, which is why I set it to "do not use this partition", but it's still trying to mount to it. The error that I get does indicate that specific partition.
[21:56:32] <oerheks> no, windows does notmake an EFI partition on ntfs.. disable secure boot might help you out.
[21:57:40] <Guest2027> Thanks, I'll open Gparted. First I need to see if I can cancel the installation, which is frozen and at the same time locking GParted out.
[21:57:54] <Jeremy31> Guest2027: you shut down Windows from CLI with shutdown /s
[21:58:46] <Guest2027> oerheks, I guess the Samsung tool does it. I'll see if disabling secure boot helps.
[21:59:11] <Guest2027> Jeremy, no I just did a normal shutdown.
[22:00:02] <Guest2027> Ok Jeremy, what do with Gparted?
[22:00:20] <Guest2027> OR should I go back and fix something else first?
[22:02:13] <Jeremy31> Guest2027: Boot back into Windows, open a command line and enter> shutdown /s
[22:02:47] <Jeremy31> Windows will make it look like partitions are still mounted if hybrid shutdown is used
[22:03:40] <Guest2027> All right. I'll be back. Probably with a different nick. So you don't think it's about the file system? The solutions I've seen online say that reformatting to FAT32 solves it, but if I did that I would lose my Windows installation.
[22:04:13] <Jeremy31> Guest2027: or use the Ubuntu ISO and install clonezilla to clone that drive again
[22:04:52] <Jeremy31> If you still have that original, not much you can lose other than sanity
[22:05:30] <Guest2027> So if I do go the clonezilla route, do I need to just clone the main Windows partition, or do I also need the diagnostics partition, EFI, etc?

[22:51:41] <MrCollinsGA> Ubuntu 20.04 when I run a batch script and there are unseen errors, which log do I check?
[22:52:51] <Jeremy31> Calling it from terminal?
[22:52:56] <MrCollinsGA> Jeremy31, yes
[22:53:17] <Jeremy31> maybe /var/log/kern.log
[22:53:29] <MrCollinsGA> Jeremy31, ok thank you. I will chk that now.
[22:55:15] <oerheks> Some applications also create logs in /var/log https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/viewing-and-monitoring-log-files#2-log-files-locations or simply journalctl

[23:47:56] <jhutchins> MrCollinsGA: Which log, if any, depends on what program/command is running.

[23:49:47] <jhutchins> If you're running a script inside a script, look at the internal script and see what it's running, and whether it's redirecting it's output.
