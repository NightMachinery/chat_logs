[01:02:35] <Altreus> hmm this script might have been fatpacked or something cos it's doing weird stuff
[01:02:45] <tamwile> Botje: ah yes, i think cpanm created it itself
[01:02:59] <tamwile> maybe i should add it to my path, is that right ?
[01:03:16] <tamwile> it can't automatically add it
[01:03:26] <vms14> tamwile: you can set the env variable PERL5LIB

[01:03:29] <perlbot> Altreus: makes the process of installing modules in one's home directory (or anywhere other than the default) easy. Remember to start with the bootstrap install - that fixes the "I don't have local::lib yet" problem. http://p3rl.org/local::lib <3

[01:03:46] <Altreus> cpanm put it in the right place by default but you still haev to configure your env like that ^

[01:18:15] <vms14> ahahaha 
[01:18:57] <vms14> I did not learn raku yet, and it's not one of my goals anyways
[01:19:25] <vms14> actually the only reason I've learned perl was because I considered I should learn awk
[01:20:00] <vms14> I thought awk was a nice tool to have in your hands, but perl somehow is the evolution of awk + a general purpose language
[01:20:07] <tamwile> imo it's a pretty sad reason 
[01:20:27] <vms14> maybe, but perl turned to be much more useful than what I thought
[01:20:39] <tamwile> it meant awk is not easy enough, or not powerful enough
[01:21:03] <vms14> in a way that I think it's the language I've written most code with
[01:21:19] <vms14> tamwile: awk is easier and is posix, but perl is a general purpose language
[01:21:29] * GumbyPAN CPAN Upload: Test-Deep-URI-0.04 by NFG https://metacpan.org/release/NFG/Test-Deep-URI-0.04
[01:21:33] <vms14> and it's kinda omnipresent in most systems
[01:22:06] <kjetilho> I love awk.  the thing I miss most is the ability to just yank out one of the $x in a simple manner.
[01:22:27] <Altreus> I find raku to have too many surprises to be useful
[01:22:34] <vms14> never learned awk, perl is my sed awk bash and python
[01:23:50] <vms14> I love common lisp, but I write much more code in perl than in lisp (lisp has no thread support in netbsd and most libraries won't work)
[01:24:45] <vms14> the code in lisp is much nicer and does weird stuff, but at the end of the day the code that actually does something is in perl
[01:25:15] <tamwile> why is there no thread suport on netbsd ?
[01:25:33] <tamwile> Altreus: what kind of surprises ?
[01:26:36] *** Quits: rootx74 (~rootx74@user/rootx74) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[01:26:43] <tamwile> from what i read, perl hat mainly 2 advantages : back compatibility and speed, i think raku is maybe a little slower
[01:27:13] <Altreus> Well this sort of thing, for example: Type check failed in assignment to $!uuid; expected UUID but got UUID (UUID.new(bytes => Bu...)
[01:27:34] <tamwile> but i have never written in perl before and i'm not obsessed with perf, raku seems good (grammar keyworld looks awesome)
[01:27:39] <Altreus> There's also the single-argument rule, which means you have to remember the single-argument rule every time you pass arguments
[01:27:56] <Altreus> Raku has a lot of awesome ideas that Perl could probably implement :)
[01:29:17] <tamwile> but your uuid example is considered as a bug, right ? so it should be fixed someday, or e don't understand
[01:29:39] <tamwile> it's not a design flaw of the language
[01:30:51] <vms14> tamwile: threads are a bit different than linux
[01:31:18] <vms14> there are threads, but software expecting linux threads needs a rewrite
[01:31:54] <vms14> anyways I'm quite impressed with the perl support in netbsd
[01:33:05] <vms14> there are a lot of perl modules in the netbsd repo, I think stills have troubles when using cpan + ffi, but most of ffi modules are in the repo and work
[01:33:22] <vms14> and I think cpan is able to compile some ffi modules here
[01:35:08] <tamwile> so sbcl could add thread support if they had time
[01:35:34] <vms14> asked them and they told me to do it by myself xD
[01:35:56] <tamwile> XD
[01:36:39] <vms14> anyways I'm not so interested in lisp as I was before, now I start to like forth
[01:36:40] <tamwile> what about scheme or racket ? or you are only CL-compatible ?
[01:36:58] <vms14> don't like scheme, althought I loved s7 scheme
[01:37:07] <vms14> and racket is very fun to play with
[01:37:37] <tamwile> i don't know forth at all, what's so good about it ?
[01:37:50] <vms14> but forth is a language that let's me have my own language, in the sense is so easy to implement that I can afford to do it
[01:38:25] <vms14> and I can have some metaprogramming features, although I'm making a very weird forth
[01:39:58] <vms14> it's easy, you have a stack and words, words are the function equivalent, the language uses rpn so it just needs to evaluate words and the stack let's you have arguments without caring about scope and alike
[01:41:26] <vms14> you have a dictionary where words are stored and there are two kinds of word, the primitive which are like builtin functions, and the colon words which are just a list of words, if you find a primitive you execute, if you find a colon word you execute all those words
[01:42:16] *** Joins: EvanCarroll (~ecarroll@98.39.65.185)
[01:42:17] <vms14> now if I can make a lisp language I can because implementing forth has teached me how to implement function definitions, which was a thing I was missing

[01:43:15] <tamwile> are you making a compiler or interpreter ?
[01:44:58] <vms14> interpreter
[01:45:12] <tamwile> i'm not sure to get the usefulness of colon worlds, if i have prim1 and prim2, and colon1 is a list composed of prim1 and prim2, then 2 3 colon1 is equivalent to 2 3 prim1 prim2 ? is that right ?
[01:45:16] <vms14> I've made a lisp transpiler to perl written in perl xD
[01:45:27] *** Quits: Awaru (Awaru@gateway/vpn/airvpn/awaru) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[01:45:46] <vms14> colon words are usually defined by the user
[01:46:10] <vms14> yes, it is that
[01:46:22] <vms14> if you want to play with what I have
[01:46:46] <vms14> https://termbin.com/omjj just download this and type perl file.pl
[01:46:51] <tamwile> so colon word is like function composition ?
[01:46:53] <vms14> or the name you gave it
[01:47:23] <vms14> I suppose yes
[01:47:44] <vms14> : oh 1 2 3 ;  when you execute oh it will get translated to 1 2 3
[01:48:07] <vms14> but this forth is weird in the sense I'm not doing it how I should
[01:49:02] <vms14> usually forth has a return stack and when it finds a colon word it saves the next word to the return stack, then "enters" to that word and executes all, later pops the return stack so it executes the next word
[01:49:54] <vms14> I have an array named @words_to_execute instead and this is what the interpreter looks, when I find a colon word I just push the words inside that word to that array
[01:50:13] <vms14> at the end of the code are the words defined
[01:50:56] <vms14> and added lists to support that way approach and be able to use loops if etc
[01:51:18] <vms14> 1 { 1 2 3 } { 4 5 6 } if       this would execute 1 2 3
[01:51:27] <vms14> 1 is the test condition

[12:45:26] <dwalker> I'm struggling with metacpan to try to learn from published modules the question "what dists use both App::Cmd and Pod::Usage"  I want to see examples of using these two modules together.  Is that possible?
[12:46:00] <rindolf> xcombelle: you want2use py.test
[12:52:37] <rindolf> dwalker: do 2 separate queries and intersect?
[12:53:34] <dwalker> rindolf: yeah, but how? pls excuse my cluelessness
[12:54:40] <vague> dwalker, I guess the question is, what exactly are you struggling with when using those two modules
[12:54:41] <rindolf> perlbot: set
[12:54:42] <perlbot> rindolf: No factoid found. Did you mean one of these: [sed] [.sd] [.st] [st] [sad] [sst] [sth] [6st] [.se] [seo]
[12:56:30] <dwalker> vague: I have migrated two old one-file .pl script into a new dist that uses App::Cmd.  All good so far, but I have a load of stuff in pod format that I want to use, but the App:Cmd docs don't have any examples of how to use Pod::Usage
[12:57:07] <vague> Maybe this, https://metacpan.org/pod/Pod::Usage#-input-handle ?
[12:57:09] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Pod::Usage - extracts POD documentation and shows usage information - metacpan.org ]

[12:59:09] <rindolf> xcombelle: nice.
[12:59:56] <dwalker> thanks ppl, on another note, is App::Cmd recommended for making new command line utilities?
[13:01:00] <rindolf> dwalker: i think so
[13:01:26] <vague> It's a tool. If it works for you then sure, use it.

It seems to be that the combination of LWP and cloudflare is the reason. If I change the url to another one, it works as expected. Do you have any hints how to get LWP::Simple working with the given URL?

[22:00:37] <stanrifkin> How can I just "include" a .pl file like in C?
[22:01:16] <thrig> depends on what your requirements are, and how you want to use things
[22:01:37] <Grinnz> normally, by making the includable library a perl module
[22:02:22] <Grinnz> give it a package name, and a file path matching the package name: SomeProject/Thing.pm starting with package SomeProject::Thing;
[22:02:38] <stanrifkin> I have a bunch of "use modules" etc. and want to put the use statements in one file so I don't have to repeat it in every file.
[22:03:06] <Grinnz> put in a library path (convention is lib/ in the project directory), tell perl or your script about the full path to that library path, and then "use SomeProject::Thing;" will load and import from that module
[22:03:19] <buu> stanrifkin: On the whole I'd advise against it
[22:03:37] <buu> But there's a couple of modules that do stuff like that on cpan
[22:03:39] <Grinnz> ah, https://metacpan.org/pod/Import::Base is designed for this use case
