[00:00:45] <PerfDave> I run SSH on a nonstandard port, use key-only auth, and use fail2ban.
[00:01:09] <PerfDave> The first avoids discovery, the second discourages cracking attempts, the third deals with particularly persistant idiots.
[00:01:21] <nomagno> miromoto: Think of an IP address as your physical house's location, and of as a domain as a cheap mailbox that forwards everything it receives to your house
[00:02:05] <PMT> Given the prevalence of people scanning all of IPv4 these days, unless you're v6-only, the first only saves you from the lowest-hanging fruit seekers.
[00:02:13] <nomagno> Similarly, getting phone numbers that you can put in an advert jingle like '123 456' is prohivitively expensive
[00:02:45] *** Quits: Nearrexa (~nearrexa@gateway/tor-sasl/nearrexa) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[00:03:08] <sney> PMT: there are a lot of those lowest hanging fruit seekers, though. like spam, I would guess that they intentionally target the hosts less likely to have any kind of security approach at all
[00:03:56] <Blondie101010> sure, using a non standard port does reduce the number of undesirable connection attempts
[00:04:15] <Blondie101010> but it won't stop a targetted attack
[00:04:22] <sney> zactly
[00:04:51] <sney> and if you have the botnet spam reduced to a trickle, then actual attacks are easier to identify
[00:05:11] <PMT> sney: sure, they certainly exist, and you're cutting them out, but like, I found out I had left it running open to a VM on a very nonstandard port when I found logs of not-me connection attempts recently.

[00:06:44] <PMT> Blondie101010: yes, my point being that exhaustive port scanning is not necessarily deliberate targeting, as I'm not running any interesting public services on this IP.
[00:07:11] <Blondie101010> it's pretty targetted as it's generally a waste of resources

[00:07:23] <sney> you said it's a vm, so it's probably in an ip block known to belong to some commercial hosting/vps provider
[00:07:34] <PMT> sney: it's a VM on my local network.
[00:07:45] <sney> uh oh, the botnets are coming from inside the house
[00:07:49] <Blondie101010> :)
[00:07:53] <PMT> I didn't say they got in. :)
[00:08:09] <Blondie101010> so the VM has a public IP or what?
[00:08:22] <Blondie101010> a port redirect?
[00:08:23] <PMT> Like I said, I discovered I'd forgotten to remove an ancient port forward rule to its SSH port when I found logs of people trying to get in.

[03:48:09] <dvs> linsux: I think that's too old for the amd graphics firmware.
[03:48:37] <linsux> so what to do
[03:48:46] <abrotman> asarch: that's not a "process"
[03:49:11] <linsux> https://www.amd.com/en/support/graphics/amd-radeon-hd/ati-mobility-radeon-hd-3000-series/ati-mobility-radeon-hd-3670
[03:49:17] <linsux> will this work with latest kernel?
[03:49:41] <asarch> The only way to stop it is to force off
[03:49:57] <asarch> abrotman, everything in Linux is actually a process
[03:51:58] <asarch> watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CP#0 stuck for 23s! [irq/17-b43:901]
[03:52:29] <linsux> thought linux is good at old hardware
[03:53:52] <linsux> it's just 14 years ago
[03:54:49] <dvs> linsux: the driver in the kernel cuts off at HD 7000 series.
[03:56:40] <linsux> so no luck to make it to work i guess

[11:30:40] <zoug> hello, I'm using logrotate but cannot find the rotated log files, it seems like they are deleted even though I specify "rotate 14" in the configuration file, is logrotate copying it to another location? When running logrotate -d /etc/logrotate.conf (with my conf, included, in /etc/logrotate.d) it says " after 1 days (14 rotations), empty log files
[11:30:41] <zoug> are rotated, old logs are removed" which doesn't sound right (I want to keep old logs up until 14 days since I specify rotate 14). Am I doing something wrong? Thanks
[11:31:58] <jelly> zoug, can you show your config, contents of relevant directory, and which Debian release you're running?
[11:32:08] <zoug> this is the config (for suricata) that I want to run: https://paste.debian.net/1215123/
[11:32:44] <zoug> jelly: debian 11, the /var/log/suricata/ dir (that is rotated) contains the usual suricata config files, but only for today, nothing older is ketp

[11:36:30] <jelly> zoug, I'd like to see actual ls -la /var/log/suricata/ and your/package logrotate config files matching those paths.
[11:36:30] <cosimone> crab: i will check those out later, thanks

[11:37:02] <jelly> cosimone, booting the old kernel
[11:37:09] <cosimone> ah, that's what you mean
[11:37:22] <cosimone> yes, 5.10.0-8 doesn't seem to have this issue
[11:37:35] <Ueb> apt autoremove is not recognized by the system
[11:37:37] <cosimone> it happened after the newest minor bullseye update (11.1)
[11:37:54] <cosimone> i tried rebuilding the initramfs, but nothing changed
[11:38:36] <Ueb> also apt autoclean is not recognized by the system
[11:38:40] <jelly> cosimone, mmm.  File a bug report for linux-image-5.10.0-9-armmp ; you could ask in #debian-kernel or #debian-arm over on irc.debian.org but I suspect you'll also get a "file a bug report" at some point
[11:38:57] <zoug> jelly: the logrotate config file has been pasted above, you need something else? ls -la of /var/log/suricata is as usual: "eve.json, fast.log, stats.log, suricata.log"
[11:39:08] <cosimone> jelly: yes, that's possible
[11:39:19] <cosimone> i'm going to ask in those channels as soon as i can
[11:39:21] <jelly> zoug, is there a reason for copytruncate?
[11:39:52] <zoug> jelly that is the default for suricata, so I think it's useful, does it have any effect on this?
[11:41:00] <jelly> zoug, that's the only unusual thing in the config, usually used when services can't properly reopen log files
[11:41:06] <Ueb> I need to remove unused packages, but "apt autoclean" and "apt autoremove" are not recognized by the system, what should I do?
[11:41:26] <jelly> and it can introduce race conditions for rotation
[11:41:38] <jelly> Ueb, which debian version do you have installed?
[11:42:19] <Ueb> jelly Debian 8.4 (jessie)
[11:43:12] <Ueb> I need to free up space
[11:43:19] <jelly> Ueb, use apt-get for autoclean and autoremove.
[11:43:36] <jelly> if you need more space, apt-get clean
[11:43:57] <jelly> will remove all the cached .deb packages, even the current versions
[11:44:35] <Ueb> ok apt-get is working

[12:35:08] <jelly> jaggz, are you supposed to be runing debian 10 or 11?

[12:35:55] <Blondie101010> cleanup old kernels and reinstall the current one
[12:35:56] <jaggz> I think, if I rebooted once, before switching stuff to bullseye, it would have put me at -18 and I could get rid of -17
[12:35:58] <jaggz> but anyway
[12:36:02] <jelly> oh.  You should have patched up buster completely first, including the reboot to the latest buster kernel
[12:36:08] <jaggz> i think the update has made the need for -18 moot
[12:36:14] <jelly> but what's done is done
[12:36:17] <jaggz> nod
[12:36:21] <jaggz> heh
[12:36:37] <Blondie101010> get a recovery drive ready :)

[12:39:30] <Blondie101010> but it's probably ok
[12:39:31] <jaggz> should I reboot before I dist-upgrade?
[12:39:46] <jaggz> Blondie101010, how would you do that?
[12:39:50] <Blondie101010> the first menu entry in the grub config
[12:39:58] <jaggz> oh, just to look?  k
[12:40:20] <jaggz> yeah, first is the new 5.x
[12:40:27] <jaggz> later is -17 now
[12:40:35] <Blondie101010> so if the install went through, time to reboot
[12:40:35] <jaggz> 4.x-17
[12:40:58] <jaggz> think all these held-back packages will not cause havok?
[12:41:06] <Blondie101010> nah
[12:41:23] <jaggz> there's like, a million of them

[12:42:48] <Blondie101010> not a bad idea

[14:56:19] <NeoCron> sorry, using strace for the first time in my life
[14:57:02] <PMT> Khepra: i mean, honestly, poll even on a 1ms timeout could be okay, it's "i'm [apparently] running this in a tight loop" where my eyebrows are pretty high.
[14:59:03] <PMT> epoll wouldn't save you from running epoll_wait in a tight loop on a miniscule timeout either, I think.

[16:10:52] <jelly> ask alpine whether that installation is 32bit or 64bit
[16:11:14] <PMT> jkc: for which value of virtualize? I would expect qemu-system-x86_64 without kvm bits to do it without a burp.
[16:11:28] <jelly> qemu-system-i386 emulates/virtualizes a 32bit CPU
[16:11:35] <willow> it's the virtual x86 image from here: https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/     assuming it's 32 because they also have a 64 image
[16:12:25] <willow> the RAM footprint of 32 is half the 64
[16:12:43] <jelly> yeah I'd say that was 32bit since there's a x86_64 right underneath
[16:13:02] <jkc> willow: That is not accurate.
[16:13:21] <jelly> it is however possible to run a 32bit OS on a 64bit x86
[16:13:27] <willow> it's funny because i don't think of 386 when i think of 32 bit.  i think of really old computers without the math co-processor, before 486

[18:35:22] <PMT> If the system doesn't POST with just the 800 MHz SODIMM in, or with two 800 MHz SODIMMs in, then you need to only opt for the 667 MHz if you can't convince the system to do that by hand.

[20:04:10] <kittonian> hi all. solved all the problems from yesterday, but need some help with making one docker container running apache as a proxy server to other containers, communicate with a separate container running nextcloud-fpm (i.e. php-fpm). I've tried a bunch of stuff but can't seem to get it to communicate. If I run nextcloud-apache instead it works just fine so I know my config, nextcloud setup, etc. is all good.

[20:37:33] <kittonian> sney, no one is around and hasn't been for days
[20:37:44] <kittonian> but this is more an apache question
[20:38:02] <kittonian> and yes, i tried asking in httpd but no one is there either
[20:39:20] <sney> if you're just looking for apache mod_proxy configuration, there are pretty good examples online (though fwiw I find nginx to be a better/more efficient proxy) but your initial question sounds more like container networking
[20:39:26] <sney> maybe you could clarify
[20:40:25] <kittonian> like i said, i can get it working just fine with nextcloud-apache and proxying to that container but this is a question specifically about communicating with php-fpm through a proxy
[20:40:59] <kittonian> i have one container running apache as a proxy to a bunch of other containers. this works just fine
[20:41:20] <kittonian> i want to have a container that runs nextcloud with php-fpm but i can't get it to communicate with php-fpm
[20:42:05] <festerdam> Also, libstdc++.so.5.
[20:43:16] <kittonian> and as I mentioned, i tried bringing up a container with nextcloud-apache to ensure that all my nextcloud stuff works properly and that works perfectly by proxypass and proxypassreverse

[20:48:42] <PMT> festerdam: apt-file can be useful for searching for specific library names or filenames.
[20:48:53] <jkc> kittonian: Yes, but is it listening only on localhost?
[20:49:19] <kittonian> how can I check that? i can get a bash prompt inside the docker container, just tell me what you want me to type to check it out
[20:49:40] <sney> check from outside the container, with e.g. netcat
[20:49:56] <sney> and/or just look at the php-fpm configuration and see what it's supposed to bind to
[20:49:59] <jkc> kittonian: ss -plnt will list all listeners.
[20:50:33] <jkc> Find the one(s) that correspond to fpm, and what is in the local address column?
[20:51:45] <kittonian> from outside the container (the main server) ss -plnt doesn't list anything pertaining to php-fpm
[20:51:59] <jkc> kittonian: I never said outside the container. INside.
[20:52:13] <jkc> Assuming that that's where fpm is running.
