[00:24:27] <mwnaylor> Are there guidelines or convetions for using cl-labels in elisp? I'm starting to use that form more often. I see dplicated code in defun bodies, then work to refactor the duplications. Often, the fragment only makes sense within the local context and doesn't fit as a top level defun in the file/package. Thus, my stimulus to use cl-labels.

[00:28:20] <mwnaylor> aidalgol: With doing stuff w/ elisp and Clojure, I find myself to be more of a bottom-up developer. For me, seeing duplicate code is the inspiration to abstract.

[01:26:25] <wickedjargon> I have a question: The forward-paragraph/backward-paragraph functions behave differently depending on the mode I'm in. For example, markdown-mode and LaTeX mode. How do I make forward-paragraph/backward-paragraph behave the same as text-mode in all modes?

[01:29:51] <wickedjargon> it's not a function key issue, I am talking about the actual functions named forward-paragraph/backward-paragraph
[01:30:06] *** Parts: GNUHacker (~foobar@fsf/member/GNUHacker) (https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/)
[01:30:52] <wickedjargon> they behave differently. For example, in markdown, a bullet point is considered a paragraph, even if there is no blank line separating the bullets. Latex considers a line with `\newline` a paragraph break
[01:31:39] <user`> Oh, when I look at the source of forward-paragraph, it uses paragraph-start and paragraph-separate regexps.
[01:31:50] <user`> So you may want to ensure that these configuration variables have the same value?

[01:34:29] <mwnaylor> Seems like the way to determine what is a sentence, paragraph, etc. is dictated by a regular expression. If the major mode redefines these, we get differnt behavior for the same (or similar) functions.
[01:34:47] <acdw> honestly i think it'd be easier to define your own, wickedjargon

[01:42:35] <mwnaylor> Tread lightly. forward-paragraph is 141 lines of code. backward-paragraph is simpler, as it calls forward-paragraph. You might break a ton if you drop in your forward-paragraph replacement.
[01:42:36] <acdw> :) good luck!

[02:42:37] <mwnaylor> As emacs was designed for a UNIX-like environment, that will give the best results. Due to horrendous Windows design and performance, some emacs operations will be extremely painful. magit performs badly on MS Windows because of the overhead spawning new processes.
[02:43:58] <bremner> emacs was designed for a TOPS-20 environment. Or maybe Multics
[02:44:19] <bremner> getting magit running on Multics emacs would be a feat
[02:44:29] <corwin> mwnaylor: are you saying this would be supported if I ssh to a non-Windows machine and try from there?  The comments in vc-git.el made me think this wasn't supported at all (and rereading the CONTRIBUTE file suggests I don't want to do it for an Emacs patch, anyway)

[10:32:43] <famubu> Hi. Emojis/emoticons are not being displayed in my emacs (27.2) gui. How can that be fixed? It works well in the non-gui version (`-nw`).
[10:33:28] <corwin> famubu: emacs won't grow "native" Emoji support until the release of Emacs 29.  Meanwhile, you might try the emojify package from (IIRC) MELPA.
[10:33:48] <corwin> Or you could build from master, of course.  In either case you need fonts with Emoji support.

[10:38:42] <famubu> I don't really know. I didn't do any configuration for fonts specially for emacs. And I had built 27.2 from source, might very well have messed up while doing so...

[20:42:04] <Shortstop> I noticed that the theme is only applied to every frame except Helm and Spacemodeline
[20:42:13] <corwin> sabas3dgh: as gnoo says.  Press and release ESC then press ":" then paste in the expression I supplied and share back the output to your *Messages* buffer.
[20:42:25] * TRS-80 adds that to reading lisr
[20:42:45] <gnoo> or C-h v package-archives if you're comfortable with that

[20:45:28] <Shortstop> since it seems like most of its kind of expected to be placed into the 'init.el' when I would rather prefer to switch it on the fly with some kind of like 'use-package' based package easily
[20:45:44] <Shortstop> yeah I've seen that site too, colors are ok, but the fonts... eh
[20:46:06] <Shortstop> but yeah I get super specific I guess. I really like the 'hack' font personally, but I guess I can just change the colors but keep the font I guess
[20:46:12] <corwin> Shortstop: I believe the customize-theme interface has tools to create a theme from "hand tweaked" custom-font settings setup in the current session, if you are looking for an "easy way".
[20:46:28] <Shortstop> but doesn't that modify the 'init.el' though?

[21:01:21] <TRS-80> I have long been a believer that people new to a project have an interesting and valuable perspective, as they see warts that longer term users have just come to gloss over or work around
[21:01:23] <bkhl> Not sure if he left again.
[21:01:24] <Nselm> bremner Im not sure what you mean. The problem is, it does not apply the font at all. C-u C-x = doesnt show any font being applied

[21:03:22] <TRS-80> corwin: I didn't mention it, but agree strongly.
[21:03:28] <gnoo> corwin: not so first class, can't have attachments in emails in sr.ht
[21:03:47] <Nselm> bremner Approximately like this: (defconst my-mode-font-lock-keywords
[21:03:48] <Nselm> ¬† (some regexe 'bold))). With the default font-lock fonts it works
[21:04:09] <gnoo> corwin: and todo.sr.ht is "markdown fist, email second" so the attachment issue was marked to be wontfix till another release

[22:07:02] <bremner> initial letters are important, ask the Iraqi

[22:10:48] <Shortstop> Not sure honestly :)
[22:10:57] <technomancy> it seems irresponsible to recommend people use a browser written in C that isn't getting patches
[22:11:16] <Shortstop> all I know is that its always better to run w3m in xterm or anything capable of 'w3m-img' plugin

[22:12:31] <technomancy> corwin: I support anything that causes fewer people to use discord and slack (including sabotaging their data centers) but it just seems unlikely to accomplish its goals
[22:12:37] <corwin> +1
[22:13:04] <Catie> Agree
[22:13:23] <acdw> yeah i went back to eww
[22:13:29] <acdw> it already does images
[22:13:38] <acdw> and variable-pitch
[22:14:00] <corwin> the root problem of modern technology is in thinking the word modern is meaningful when we talk about technology.  I think in terms of working vs broken and understandable-by-me vs not.  That latter is probably better written as "I have time for learning vs I don't"
[22:14:22] <treflip> acdw: Variable-pitch in eww annoys me. Is it possible to disable it?
[22:14:29] <artefact> "i want to be normal" vs "i want to be an outcast"
[22:14:37] <acdw> treflip: i'm sure it is
[22:14:45] <technomancy> "possible for a human to understand given an entire lifetime of study" is another interesting lens in that it disqualifies all mainstream browsers
[22:14:50] <acdw> have you tried (variable-pitch-mode -1) ?
[22:15:07] <acdw> oh god, speakign of, i enabled variable-pitch in this buffer
[22:15:08] <acdw> cursed
[22:15:18] <ggb> From an academic history perspective, modern starts somewhere around the 1500s. So all computer stuff (include Lovelace and the old looms) is modern.
[22:15:18] <corwin> technomancy: solid analysis
[22:15:36] <acdw> it'd be nice for emacs to get proper text-width stuff
[22:15:40] <acdw> pixel-alignment
[22:15:44] <acdw> it'd be /so dope/
[22:15:53] <corwin> tech that we will never have time to fully understand isn't much better than tech we aren't allowed to modify by terms of licensing.
[22:15:56] <ggb> So, agreeing with corwin that the only distinction is working vs broken, not modern vs not.

[22:16:49] <treflip> acdw: It doesn't help. Maybe there's another way to fix my problem. Variable-pitch text uses the fallback font instead of terminus. If I could make it use terminus too, I could live with that.

[22:19:03] <Shortstop> treflip can you display images in w3m in Emacs though? I thought you can't use 'w3m-img' without using a terminal that supports it, and even then, you have to install it separately for your distro
[22:20:13] <Shortstop> corwin good point, on a similar note, I upgraded my father in law's machine to Linux Mint since he literally asked me if I could upgrade his Windows 7 laptop to Windows 11.

[22:22:47] <corwin> I think the key use cases where it shines are pinning a package so the version of a package that works for you keeps being the one you use (ELPAs suck for this), and then if you are always wanting the bleeding edge from a package's repo.  If your issue is just "it isn't published to an elpa" the OOB package.el is probably fine.

[23:25:43] <offby1> hey magit people (hi e1f ltns): sometime in the last few months, I've been getting a "do you want to save this buffer prompt" when I switch buffers with C-x b. I can't tell where it's coming from but I suspect it's magit.  I hate this behavior and would like to disable it, but cannot figure out how.  Anyone know?

[23:32:29] <rpav> i can confirm that changing it to "Never" causes it to not ask when M-x magit-status, with a modified file buffer in the repo

[23:33:33] <rpav> tsdh: you may not be doing/expecting the right thing; it's not _when switching buffers_, but having a buffer whose associated file is in the repository, the buffer is modified, and doing e.g. M-x magit-status
[23:33:35] <aidalgol> Catie: You play games much?
