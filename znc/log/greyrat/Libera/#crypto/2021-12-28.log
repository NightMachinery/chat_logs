[08:59:06] <Alipha> synaps3: if there's a vulnerability in one algorithm, then maybe your encryption key is compromised by your signing key isn't (or vice versa). or it's feasible that a vulnerability could occur where observing a key being used for both encryption and signing could allow the key to be recovered, where neither encrypting or signing by themselves would

[13:36:02] <pagios> Wulf: so now the verification process gloes like: the user enters abc,    backend takes abc, fetches salt from the DB (extracting last 12 bytes )     hashes them and compares with the value in db
[13:36:15] <Wulf> pagios: not sure if this came up yet, but SSHA is quite unsafe.

[13:37:03] <pagios> not sure how many
[13:37:55] <pagios> correct logic? actually i missed a step, which is the backend checks first {SSHA} to know what hash algo is used
[13:42:56] <Wulf> pagios: the backend would fetch the whole value, not just the hash.
[13:43:14] <pagios> yes but it will parse that value to extract the salt no ?
[13:43:29] <pagios> at the end backend compares the whole value1 and whole value 2

[20:05:23] <maroon> so far i see him using AES in CTR stream mode, and bitflipping the unauthenticated ciphertext when you know the plaintext
