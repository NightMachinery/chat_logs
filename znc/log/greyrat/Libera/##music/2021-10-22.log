[03:41:25] <Mindscape> its a conspiracy theory

[03:42:12] <Mindscape> both were world tier creative, charismatic humanists.  
[03:42:47] <artao> yore a conspiracy theory
[03:42:50] <Mindscape> the turks wouldnt care, except... both Bourdain and Cornell began Armenian nonprofit contributions 
[03:42:58] <Mindscape> and began considering messaging on the subject
[03:43:22] <Mindscape> if you know anything about Turks... This is like telling a Neonazi tha the Holocaust happened.  They don't take it well.
[03:43:58] <DOMF> Mindscape> i have the same suspicion about Bourdain <-- no way, Epstein killed Bourdain, not the Turks
[03:44:11] <Mindscape> it is dumb, yet there are crumbs, such as the strange twitter trolls from turkey that were posting insults publicly to Bourdain's social media the day he died
[03:44:27] <Mindscape> they never had done that before

[21:47:42] <sublim20> when it comes to band names, names that easy to remember, and easy to spell, are the important factors
[21:47:56] <sublim20> for example, dont call your band,  mourning rain
[21:47:57] <louipcD> sure
[21:48:07] <louipcD> why
[21:48:10] <sublim20> everyone will spell it morning rain, and have trouble finding it
[21:48:19] <Prints> idk, i like the name xD
[21:48:26] <sublim20> well
[21:48:26] <Prints> there prolly is a mourning rain out there
[21:48:28] <louipcD> google will figure it out
[21:48:28] <sublim20> its taken

[21:51:41] <anon> at least there was a story behind it, found some terrible sci-fi book called 'the netslaves' at a flea market iwht a friend
[21:51:49] <anon> and talked to the author -- total crazy guy
[21:52:02] <anon> but the word 'slave' is just ehhh not ideal
[21:52:04] <sublim20> how about,  'theres a dead hooker in my trunk'
[21:52:18] <anon> sublim20 is really doing the heavy lifting with these names
[21:52:30] <anon> louipcD: notesmitsh is cool :D
[21:53:03] <louipcD> lol
[21:53:15] <Bakunin> I wouldn't base any decisions on louipcD's opinion about band names
[21:53:22] <sublim20> some bands just name their band from a title of one of their songs
[21:54:10] <sublim20> how about, green desert
[21:54:43] <louipcD> i wouldnt base anything on Bakunin's opinions
[21:55:05] <sublim20> or, 'virgin marys queef'
[21:55:06] <Bakunin> I knew you'd be mad
[21:55:18] <louipcD> lol
[21:55:24] <sublim20> 'the queef of england'
[21:55:45] <Bakunin> hey louipcD, theyre named after a famous sculpture, well-known to people in the area where they came from.  You think it's generic because you're clueless.
[21:55:59] <Bakunin> Now be more clueless at me, big boy, I'm sure you've been storing it up
[21:56:11] <louipcD> lol sure
[21:56:13] <Bakunin> unleash all the pee you store in your big balls
[21:56:34] <louipcD> hahah whos mad now 
[21:56:47] <anon> here are some song titles of mine: wirenoise, follow the sky home, arcadian packets, 
[21:56:49] <anon> those are three recent ones
[21:56:52] <anon> any good for a name? 
[21:57:03] <sublim20> arcadian packets, stands out
[21:57:06] <Bakunin> <louipcD> i wouldnt base anything on Bakunin's opinions <louipcD> hahah whos mad now 
[21:58:05] <louipcD> and still you crying
[21:58:07] <sublim20> band names come from all over the place.   the band kyuss, named themselves after a monster in dungeon and dragons.   
[21:58:38] <sublim20> motley crue, got their name from some rando who said 'you all look like a motley crew'

[21:59:37] <louipcD> and dont listen to haters
[22:00:00] <anon> i got bad ocd im my own biggest hater ;-;
[22:00:05] <louipcD> everyone's gonna have their opinions
[22:00:12] <anon> sublim20: didn't know that story thats hilarious
[22:00:15] <louipcD> good music is what is important
[22:00:24] <anon> reminds me of how daft punk got their name from a review that called house music 'daft punk'
[22:00:27] <Bakunin> <louipcD> and dont listen to haters like me
[22:00:43] <louipcD> well actually i dont even know that good music is even that important lol
[22:00:51] <louipcD> good is subjective
[22:00:52] <Bakunin> guy's still mad his opinions are uninformed
[22:01:15] <louipcD> still sounds like ur the one's that hating Bakunin 
[22:01:22] <louipcD> still crying
[22:01:35] <Bakunin> you're still talking
[22:02:06] <louipcD> youre welcome to put me on ignore. nothings stopping you
[22:02:16] <Bakunin> does it soundgarden like I'm hating
[22:02:21] <Bakunin> or... was that u
[22:02:36] <louipcD> :D
[22:03:10] <sublim20> queens of the stone age, got their name because skin head punks kept showing up at their shows, so they wanted the gayest name they could think of, to deter them from coming
[22:03:13] <louipcD> oh the internet such a wonderful place hahaha
[22:04:00] <sublim20> anon, didn't know that about daft punk.  that makes soooo much sense
[22:04:06] <sublim20> never understand that name
[22:04:10] <sublim20> *underSTOOD
[22:04:52] <Bakunin> Shirley Temple's Pussy was a good name
[22:05:08] <Prints> lol wtf.. one of the videos i had up got taken down for copyright claim.. for a silent movie made in 1926
[22:05:18] <Prints> i thought it was public domain lol
[22:05:27] <sublim20> well, if you ever need inspiration for names, you can always browse through the worst band of all time (purposely bad band)  for some ideas.  https://www.allmusic.com/album/it-just-gets-worse-mw0000251935
