[03:48:05] <gwern> I don't know anything offhand about richard ngo other than he's been commenting a lot lately

[03:53:34] <adiabatic> Go on…
[03:53:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> They can keep making shiny new shit and people will forget about the previous five dozen things that didn't work
[03:54:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> And people like this guy will be like "ooh, augmented reality! :O" and then later "the AR thing doesn't work..." but by then there'll be some new shit to go "ooh" at

[07:54:37] <gwern> or gaining too much weight. awful lot of people out there too chubby
[07:54:46] <quanticle> Yeah, but weight can be lost
[07:54:55] <gwern> eh. you know that's easier said than done
[07:55:08] <quanticle> Easier than losing 2" of height
[07:55:21] <gwern> my dad loved flying fighter jets but couldn't lose the weight. in retrospect, we know now it may've been his undiagnosed celiac

[07:56:07] <quanticle> Did he at least get to continue being a pilot?
[07:56:38] <gwern> no, aside from the occasional light airplane thing. which considering how dangerous those are, I am fine with
[07:57:09] <gwern> I'm not entirely sure why, but I guess if he no longer met the military weight limits, the civvies would pass on him too

[07:58:16] <gwern> the celiac thing struck me as good news, being so treatable. I had always wondered why he hadn't made more of an effort to lose the weight when he knew the consequences

[08:11:29] <kuudes> hmm, how does celiac affect weight, gwern?
[08:12:44] <gwern> I'm thinking stuff like general ill being, inflammation, loss of appetite for normal stuff (and resorting to hyperpalatable foods like all the coca-cola he'd drink)
[08:13:33] <gwern> he's been slowly losing weight since the diagnosis and cutting out as much gluten as possible, which hadn't been working in all the previous times, so that's another reason I think that
[08:15:27] <kuudes> hmm. I was tested for celiac when I was 13 but should I maybe retest it again? my father and grandmother had it, but I understood it runs from mothers to children, not from fathers?
[08:16:05] <gwern> I've read nothing about it being x-linked. autosomal afaik
[08:16:52] <gwern> if your father and grandmother both had it, I'd be pretty concerned. 13 is not remotely old enough to screen off lifetime risk. my sister was like 20 when it hit her
[08:16:53] <kuudes> what is the preferred method to test for celiac these days? some blood screen? or still gastroscope?
[08:17:30] <gwern> blood test for antigens, and DTC consumer genomics may cover the SNPs which represent like 90% of the genetic risk
[08:17:36] <gwern> I did both to be safe
[08:18:07] <gwern> (well, I already had the 23andme, I just had no idea I should care about celiac or that they covered it)
[08:18:17] <kuudes> would you happen to have trade names I could link to my doctor?
[08:18:45] <gwern> oh, the company I used is just a private american, I can't imagine it'd help in a finnish context

In one case, HR insisted the person was actually very well compensated because, even though it might appear as if the person isn't highly paid because they were paid significantly less than many people who were one level below them, according to HR's formula, which included
[08:55:24] <feepbot> a location-based pay adjustment, the person was one of the highest paid people for their level at the entire company in terms of normalized pay. Putting aside abstract considerations about fairness, for an employee, HR telling them that they're highly paid given their location is like HR having a formula that pays based on height telling an employee that they're well paid for their
[08:55:24] <feepbot> height. That may be true according to whatever formula HR has but, practically speaking, that means nothing to the employee, who can go work somewhere that ha a smaller height-based pay adjustment.

[09:06:07] <quanticle> kuudes: Is it? Coordinating pay is illegal, but if all employers say, e.g. moving from San Francisco to Minneapolis results in a 30% pay reduction because <complicated formula>, is that a cartel? Or is that everyone responding identically to facts on the ground?

He served as the commandant of the Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp in Płaszów in German-occupied Poland for most of the camp's existence during World War II.)

[11:42:39] <quanticle> I think it's more that he was taking valuables off the Jews and keeping it for himself rather than turning them over to the Reich like a good little Nazi
[11:42:49] <PapuaHardyNet> ggreer: I think it was more an excuse to relieve him of his position, than a condemnation of his evil nature

[11:43:31] <PapuaHardyNet> yes, like quanticle said, politics should be the real cause

[16:10:34] <kuudes> not in teenage, but easily in negative age
[16:11:52] <PapuaHardyNet> man, when you write enough SQL you start forgetting how to write queries in python
[16:12:41] <PapuaHardyNet> kuudes: meh, try (1) a restart, (2) a factory reset, (3) a repair shop check, (4) a new phone
[16:13:56] <kuudes> 1 done, 2 seems risky, 3 I don't know even... I guess I need to focus more on 4 but I have been procrastrinating
[16:14:55] <PapuaHardyNet> factory reset then. it should also force you to back up valuable data
[16:17:59] <kuudes> well ids are problem - after a factory reset I would have to reid to banking apps etc which id me to the world
[16:22:37] <PapuaHardyNet> could you clarify what you mean by "reid to banking apps"? I have similar experiences but I don't know exactly how yours differs from mine
[16:23:23] <kuudes> over here you can id to about anything with banking apps which broadcast your identity
[16:23:55] <kuudes> you have identified strongly to your banking app in your phone with a otp
[16:24:26] <kuudes> I guess I can re identify myself to a blank phone with another otp, but it causes serious stoppage to my life if it goes badly
[16:24:54] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, that's a pretty dangerous single point of failure for your infrastructure
[16:25:08] <PapuaHardyNet> (well, I have the same SPoF)
[16:25:18] <kuudes> well not dangerous, more inconvenient
[16:25:54] <PapuaHardyNet> let me confirm this: you can "id to about anything" meaning non-banking apps and services use this identity thing that the banking apps create, for purposes of verifying your identity?
[16:26:02] <kuudes> yes
[16:26:19] <PapuaHardyNet> is that not an invasion of privacy? what services require such a verification?
[16:26:24] <kuudes> what
[16:26:35] <kuudes> healthcare and everything you need an id card for
[16:26:41] <kuudes> postal services
[16:26:47] <PapuaHardyNet> oh, okay, so government and gov-adjacent services
[16:26:48] <PapuaHardyNet> no big deal
[16:26:56] <kuudes> also buying stuff
[16:27:05] <PapuaHardyNet> of course, it is a bank, you use it to pay money
[16:27:06] <kuudes> basicly things where you normally need to show id
[16:27:24] <kuudes> the point is that you can do things online which you need a physical id for normally
[16:27:33] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, perhaps it is time for you to get a phone solely as a identification machine
[16:27:36] <kuudes> this is also why it is bad that google etc don't allow it
[16:27:57] <kuudes> well, yes, backup is problematic in that way
[16:28:18] <kuudes> though you don't need that much of a backup per se, because you can go to physical bank office to id yourself etc
[16:28:35] <kuudes> the final stop is the police, if you lose all id infos
[16:28:55] <kuudes> but indeed it is bad that google can ban you and then your stuff just does not work and you have no recourse
[16:29:17] <PapuaHardyNet> sheesh, the "google can ban you" isn't a part of my threat model and it should be
[16:29:34] <PapuaHardyNet> my government and bank institutions are connected to my gmail email instead of something more resilient
[16:29:47] <kuudes> you should be able at least to pre id yourself with eidas to google, and then if you lose stuff, you should be able to gain control by again iding yourself with eidas as being the same person
[16:30:00] <kuudes> not this whole "send a photo of your driving licence" stuff which is madness
[16:30:14] <kuudes> in eu we have electronic id, we should force google and facebook to respect that
[16:30:20] <PapuaHardyNet> that you should
[16:31:00] <kuudes> most normal local places where password matters, use eidas / banking id in password reset
[16:31:19] <kuudes> so that you can just reset your password but you need to id yourself with the legal id through the system
[16:31:48] <kuudes> this has been useful especially when some hacker/breach has caused need to shut down all user ids to a service
[16:32:33] <kuudes> ie there is about no way some university would process some tens of thousands of user id clearings in 1 day
[16:33:13] <kuudes> but thanks. I will have to check for a new phone

[22:17:37] <feep> fuck
[22:17:44] <feep> I wish I could jump into the eliezer ngo conversation at certain points
[22:17:56] <feep> because there's things that I think eliezer is bad at explaining that I genuinely think I could explain better.
[22:18:30] <pompolic> now that i think about it i'm not sure i can point at particular things
[22:18:42] <pompolic> but i got the same impression reading EY
[22:18:53] <pompolic> e.g. the whole bit about consequentialism doesn't seem _that_ hard
[22:19:10] <pompolic> "ah the danger is in the very act of running the search"
[22:19:21] <pompolic> the post, later: "the danger is in the very act of running the search"
[22:19:30] <feep> like, I think at 3.3 eliezer misses a misunderstanding, which is if you optimize plans without the knowledge that humans will execute them they'll be incoherent, because they will not account for human limitations, and the more information about human limitations you leak into the planner search, the better the plans get, the more you will run unfriendliness risks
[22:19:56] <feep> like, it's genuinely an unsolved problem how to *output a safe plan*.
[22:20:06] <feep> or even a safely verifiable plan.
[22:20:29] <feep> because you have to merge in "and then the humans execute the plan" and that's where it exerts pressure *on the humans reading the plan*.
[22:20:39] <mst> given the ease with which 4chan tricks humans into making mustard gas
[22:21:10] <feep> so naively, yes, the mind control basilisk plan is the "best plan"
[22:21:18] <feep> and then you're back at ai box.
[22:23:05] <feep> I think this is eliezer's point with "the plan search is the dangerpart, it doesn't matter that it loops through humans".
[22:23:25] <pompolic> sounds about right
[22:23:40] <pompolic> i think i have a lower prior on humans being mindhackable than eliezer does
[22:24:01] <pompolic> and if i were to justify it, i would appeal to the same reasons alignment is difficult

[22:24:19] <pompolic> this applies to humans!
[22:24:33] <feep> yeah but on the other hand, consider ads, consider cults.
[22:24:54] <feep> making a human hit its off switch seems very feasible with one on one interaction

[22:25:47] <pompolic> it would've been too easy
[22:27:16] <pompolic> I'm also thinking, mind-hack mithridatism
[22:27:24] <pompolic> to build resistance, start with smaller mind-hacks
[22:27:30] <pompolic> this is not a serious suggestion
[22:27:47] <feep> safety research agenda: destroy ublock origin
[22:28:04] <pompolic> or something like HUMSEC
[22:28:21] <pompolic> actually research exploitable flaws in the human mind and develop countermeasures
[22:28:40] <pompolic> a problem i see with this is that i don't think humans are all that plastic
[22:28:48] <pompolic> (leverage joke 2 probably goes here)
[22:29:55] <pompolic> i did, however, end up developing countermeasures for people trying to hack my attention
[22:30:02] <pompolic> ...then i stopped using them and got miserable

[22:37:35] <pompolic> further thinking: to my understanding, two big things in social engineering are pretexting and creating pressure
[22:37:47] <pompolic> such as time pressure
[22:38:35] <pompolic> i don't know where i get this from, but i would assume an AI doesn't need time pressure (or rather, if the plans are read async, there's not really a time pressure as such)
[22:38:44] <pompolic> then again it could just emit plans with short time horizons

Only the generate models charge on input and output characters, while other models charge on...

[22:41:26] <PapuaHardyNet> pompolic: what were your countermeasures btw?
[22:42:27] <PapuaHardyNet> "per character basis" hilarious.
[22:42:27] <pompolic> literally looking away, with extra steps
[22:42:30] <pompolic> that is to say
[22:42:53] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: it might be a character model. also, people are perennially confused about BPEs
[22:43:04] <pompolic> i'm pretty good at crowding out thoughts with internally-generated whatever
[22:43:24] <pompolic> maybe it's the inverse of Looking or whatever
[22:43:47] <pompolic> damn this is hard
[22:44:06] <pompolic> but, drawing your attention to something is, i think, kind of a handshake 
[22:45:32] <gwern> (at a very quick crude estimate, the embeddings would cost $48 for gwern.net annotations, and $57 for the pages)
[22:45:47] <PapuaHardyNet> so you have to prevent a DDoS of your attention by dropping SYNs?
[22:45:57] <pompolic> you have to a) hear the request b) interpret the request c) run some heuristic about expected utility d) perform the mental motion equivalent to redirecting and locking your attention to the thing
[22:46:22] <gwern> "what did the TCP/IP stack say to the priest?" "Forgive me, father, for I have SYNed"
[22:46:40] <pompolic> in my personal case the c) is pretty shit -- i am eminently distractable
[22:47:02] <Gurkenglas> 'So the visual cortex is an example of quite impressive cognition in humans and many other animals. But I'd call this "pattern-recognition" rather than "searching for high-scoring results".' 'Yup! And it is no coincidence that there are no whole animals formed entirely out of nothing but a visual cortex!' <- new headcanon: Beholders only ever reproduce behavior they've seen, they never reason anything out from 
[22:47:02] <Gurkenglas> first principles.
[22:47:10] <pompolic> you can still break a), b), and d) still
[22:49:34] <pompolic> there's also e) which is something like install a mental motion you train yourself to execute when you recognize the felt sense of "attention lock" (i think hypnosis would be a subset of this category i just made up) 
[22:50:18] <gwern> I don't think you know you're hypnotized
[22:50:39] <pompolic> i don't know, i've never been hypnotized, i think
[22:50:45] <pompolic> never did succeed either
[22:50:59] <pompolic> _however_
[22:51:07] <gwern> at the one performance I went to, selection was done by some light induction and then imagining you raised your arm. people were raising their arms and had no idea. and then the post-performance hypnotic suggestions, the people doing them certainly didn't realize it
[22:51:20] <pompolic> i can wake up at will from dreams
[22:51:34] <pompolic> (provided of course that i become somewhat lucid lol)
[22:51:45] <gwern> what does having 'a will' mean in a dream?
[22:51:53] *** Joins: two2thehead (~user@27.114.133.63)
[22:52:24] <pompolic> hmm... i can execute a "wake up" mental motion, or not
[22:52:43] <pompolic> i think "at will" is probably too strong
[22:53:48] <pompolic> anyway yeah, i don't think you necessarily know you've been hypnotized
[22:54:01] <pompolic> you also don't necessarily notice you've been reading stupid shit on the internet for hours (it me)
[22:54:23] <pompolic> but i think the mental state has a "texture" that you can in fact notice
[22:55:27] <pompolic> the reason i brought up hypnosis, because to my understanding the trick of it is to affix the inductee's attention to a particular focus
[22:55:34] <pompolic> such as the hypnotist's words
[22:56:05] <pompolic> i'm asserting that you can in fact reflectively notice what such "attention lock" feels like
[22:56:39] <gwern> but then you are, at best, noticing induction, you aren't noticing hypnosis. much like how you can notice falling asleep, but then inside a dream, lucidity is exceptionally difficult and rare
[22:57:03] <pompolic> yeah
[22:57:07] <pompolic> i think that part is trainable
[22:57:37] <pompolic> it's not unlike training reality checking 
[22:58:43] <pompolic> for waking up, you'd need to be lucid enough to formulate cognition like "I'm asleep, so i need to increase my lucidity until i wake up"
[22:59:18] <pompolic> i don't really know how originally i ended up with the mental motion i mentioned, but it can be performed without actually being lucid
[23:00:47] <pompolic> hmm, i think i used to have nightmares where i was lucid enough to realize it was a nightmare, but it took a while to figure out how to wake up
[23:01:25] <pompolic> and it amounted to, instead of moving my body in the dream, trying to break through the sleep paralysis and moving my body irl (at least this was the internal experience of it)
[23:01:41] <pompolic> afterwards i noticed i would just wake up from dreams i got bored of
[23:02:56] <pompolic> so to sum up... this mental motion might be "run a search on motor commands adjacent to what i feel i'm using and find the one that moves the real thing"
[23:03:24] <pompolic> undoing some weird dissociation from the body
[23:03:32] <pompolic> i think this would work for hypnosis as well
[23:04:01] <pompolic> and directing my attention also feels like motor commands
[23:04:13] <Gurkenglas> wait so why do you think doing that boring thing solves other things after you figured out the boredom did it
[23:04:58] *** Joins: clone_of_saturn (~visitant@user/clone-of-saturn/x-1551297)
[23:05:28] <pompolic> it wasn't boredom that did it?
[23:05:45] *** clone_of_saturn is now known as saturn2
[23:05:51] <pompolic> i meant to imply that i generalized it from "wake up from nightmare" to "wake up"
[23:06:17] <pompolic> something that i think i haven't entirely explained, because i failed to think about it well
[23:06:24] <pompolic> have you ever gotten bored in a dream?
[23:06:41] <pompolic> well, have you ever had a thought "this dream is boring" in a dream?
[23:06:55] <pompolic> i think that shows something else is going on as well
[23:07:41] <pompolic> this is a sort of reflective access you don't really get in dreams and i don't have a single idea how i ended up with it
[23:09:14] <pompolic> i think however that it generalizes to attention hacking too

[23:11:20] <pompolic> for example: i mentioned pretexting: i'd listen to someone trying to get money off me by asking for a donation for some fake charity, or whatever
[23:11:25] <pompolic> completely believe them
[23:11:52] <pompolic> as part of visualizing the story they are telling
[23:12:04] <pompolic> then execute said mental motion and just evict the whole thing from cache
[23:16:29] <pompolic> all that said, though, this is all just a cope for not having a good attention prioritization mechanism
[23:17:24] <pompolic> and i think c) from what i described above, having a good (or at least coherent-at-all) model of what is worth your attention is much better for this purpose

Just eight percent of Manhattan’s million private-sector office workers are going to the office five days a week — and 54% are still fully remote, according to the latest survey from the Partnership for New York City. Just 28% of office workers are at the office on an average day, compared to about 80% before the

[23:23:14] <feepbot> industry, where 77% of workers are showing up to the office on a given day and which is directly vested in having people do that so that employers keep shelling out top dollar for those offices.
