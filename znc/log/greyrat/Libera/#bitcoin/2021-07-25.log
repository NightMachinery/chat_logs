[14:07:27] <cvmn> i'm very confused about the BIP39 seed.  i can't find a setting in the bitcoin-q app.
[14:08:45] <luke-jr> you won't
[14:08:53] <luke-jr> bitcoin-qt doesn't use BIP39
[14:09:13] <cvmn> ?
[14:09:18] <luke-jr> seeds and wallets are generally not portable between different wallet software
[14:09:38] <cvmn> interesting.  but sensible.
[14:09:59] <cvmn> btw, are you the gentoo ebuild maintainer of bitcoin*?
[14:10:04] <luke-jr> yes
[14:11:10] <cvmn> any thoughts about the consensus change and how long it takes to get it reviewed?
[14:11:17] <luke-jr> ?
[14:11:39] <luke-jr> Taproot is already reviewed, lockedin, and ready for you to deploy it
[14:12:41] <luke-jr> probably need to set a package.unmask cuz Gentoo's solution to explicit user opt-in was to mask it
[14:13:05] <luke-jr> (I liked some of the other solutions better, but oh well)
[14:13:24] <cvmn> oh.  so reason i'm stuck with older version is due to masking.
[14:14:00] <cvmn> wasn't it possible to have a trapdoor use flag?  e.g. if USE=trapdoor, then version will stuck in older one.  or is this a bad idea?
[14:16:10] <cvmn> more importantly, got any advise on me using bitcoin?  if bitcoin-qt lacks bip39, or seeding, i guess this makes it a bad/lacking app?
[14:16:15] <luke-jr> that was what I did in the overlay
[14:16:23] <luke-jr> but Gentoo folks wanted a mask instead :/
[14:16:43] <luke-jr> no, BIP39 is inadvisable/bad

[14:18:23] <earnestly> luke-jr: What would be one of the better ways of backing up a wallet "off-computer" with bitcoin-core?
[14:18:47] <luke-jr> File menu-> Backup Wallet
[14:19:11] <luke-jr> one of the reasons BIP39 is bad, is that it ISN'T a backup, yet people want to pretend it is
[14:19:16] <earnestly> luke-jr: off-computer
[14:19:25] <cvmn> luke-jr: then copy the binary wallet, which is not backup-able on paper/titanium sheet?
[14:19:29] <luke-jr> yes, you can backup to a USB stick
[14:19:33] <earnestly> Off electronics
[14:19:47] <earnestly> So that you don't have to worry about flash failing
[14:19:47] <luke-jr> no way to do that sanely
[14:19:57] <earnestly> Dead sea scrolls > hdds
[14:20:03] <luke-jr> not really
[14:20:23] <earnestly> One has a history of lasting, the other has an expiry time in the years
[14:20:36] <luke-jr> you need to refresh your backups regularly anyway
[14:20:46] <luke-jr> just keep multiple on diverse media formats
[14:23:20] <earnestly> Both not very robust and prone to failure in ways that are virtually unrecoverable
[14:23:35] <luke-jr> if you really want a mnemonic-based wallet, you might setup Electrum (but be sure to only use it for funds you send yourself, or connected to your own node)
[14:23:49] <luke-jr> Electrum doesn't use BIP39, but has a "better" mnemonic format
[14:23:54] <earnestly> I'm not suggesting mnemonic or any method that would be worse such as bip39
[14:24:26] <earnestly> But some way to restore wallets from a medium that can be kept more securely (in the robustness sense) than on flash media or spinning rust
[14:24:45] <luke-jr> you could burn a CD-R too, not that I really trust those more
[14:25:08] <luke-jr> ultimately, though, wallets need a lot of data, not just the private key

[14:26:17] <earnestly> luke-jr: The problem is those CDs can fail in surprising ways and become unrecoverable
[14:26:34] <cvmn> yes.  we need things engraved on titanium.
[14:26:41] <earnestly> Even if someone printed something out and it got wet it might still be disernable
[14:26:55] <luke-jr> how will a set of 5 different USB sticks, different brands and sizes, different filesystems, fail?
[14:27:28] <cvmn> if all of them fall in 1 bucket of water.
[14:27:29] <luke-jr> short of something like an EMP or their location being compromised
[14:27:40] <earnestly> The problem is now you have to maintain backups across multiple objects, with security (infosec) implications and the increased risk of messing up
[14:27:42] <cvmn> yes.  and emp.
[14:27:44] <luke-jr> and you can burn a paper :p
[14:27:54] <cvmn> yes, but not titanium sheet.
[14:27:54] <earnestly> But you can still recover from burned paper
[14:28:00] <earnestly> To a degree
[14:28:07] <luke-jr> lolno
[14:28:17] <earnestly> With electronics it tends to fail entirely even if the error is unrelated
[14:28:32] <luke-jr> point is the difference is between user screwup and media screwup
[14:28:33] <earnestly> Although there are tools which can help recover in those cases
[14:28:36] <cvmn> earnestly: engrave it on a titanium.
[14:28:43] <luke-jr> you can't stop user screwup
[14:28:56] <luke-jr> so "they all fall in a bucket of water" doesn't count ;)

[14:31:13] <earnestly> (One had failed though, but it was a fireball and they're known to fail)
[14:32:11] <earnestly> luke-jr: But it would be nice if there was some way, even if it's awkward and tedious, to go from a seed or some string of letters, to regaining a wallet.  As a last resort
[14:32:21] <earnestly> Normal practice would be to use backups as you suggest

[14:45:36] <belcher> what do you mean by "seeded private key generation" cvmn ? do you mean the CSPRNG ?
[14:45:48] <belcher> iirc wallets use /dev/random which is good
[14:46:12] <belcher> iv seen some people print out all 2048 words and then randomly pick 12, but that seems like overkill IMO when /dev/random is perfectly fine
[14:46:29] <belcher> consider also using multisig, as the security provided by multisig is only ever additive
[14:47:09] <belcher> as luke-jr mentioned, bip39 isnt that great because it isnt actually a backup as the user also needs to store the derivation paths and/or descriptors somehow... while with electrum's seed phrase format the 12 words really are all you need

[14:51:58] <cvmn> belcher: with bip39, i just need to store the seed.  no?
[14:52:06] <belcher> not correct
[14:52:22] <belcher> with bip39 you need to store the seed AND either the derivation path or the wallet descriptor
[14:52:33] <cvmn> derivation path?
[14:52:34] <earnestly> cvmn: It sort of depends on the wallet due to how it generates private keys for the various addresses and the path to them, etc.  The seed doesn't store that information

[14:53:48] <earnestly> cvmn: The BIP for HD wallets has a nice graphic for showing you how a seed produces a master key and then fans out as it derives multiple keys from that master
[14:53:56] <earnestly> cvmn: Those branches would be the paths
[14:53:57] <belcher> wallets in the future might decide to no longer support the scanning of certain derivation paths, if they end up so old that nobody uses them
[14:54:05] <belcher> also its possible for users to input custom derivation paths
[14:54:35] <belcher> an example of a derivation path is "m/84'/1'/0'/"
[14:54:46] <belcher> and because of the weird symbols its also hard to write down on paper or engrave into metal
[14:55:14] <belcher> because of all those apostrophies and slashes
[14:55:33] <earnestly> Those aren't really a problem for a decent monotype which are designed to make problem letters distinctive
[14:55:46] <earnestly> Which I assume one would take care with if they were engraving or such
[14:55:54] <belcher> they kind of are, especially for newbs or non-bitcoin-enthusiasts
[14:56:16] <belcher> the reason electrum's format is better is that the derivation path is implicitly encoded into the seed phrase version, and the electrum wallet can read the version and tell you if it no longer supports that format
[14:56:18] <earnestly> I'd say that those sorts of problems are out of scope
[14:56:27] <belcher> no they're not
[14:56:34] <belcher> if the user screws it up then they lose their money
[14:56:42] <belcher> its very much in scope for an app which is meant to be storing user's money
[14:56:52] <earnestly> If people decide to write O as 0 and then forget which it is, I don't think you can do much about that
[14:57:05] <earnestly> This is the same problem today with existing money systems

[14:59:53] <belcher> because remember every derivation path is valid, so the wallet software cant tell the user "sorry you've made a mistake try again"
