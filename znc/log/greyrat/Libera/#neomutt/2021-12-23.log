[00:15:54] <adray> i'm doing well. past few weeks has been very busy with family matters and interview stuff, but that's behind me now.  hoping to get back to contributing regularly
[00:16:18] <flatcap> great :-)
[00:16:47] <flatcap> interview stuff over?  does that mean you've secured a new job?
[00:22:12] <adray> yep, have about 3 weeks until I start working and training. so 3 weeks to brush up on c++
[00:22:45] <flatcap> nice one!
[00:23:31] <adray> thanks

[19:48:29] *** Quits: kzak (~kzak@nat-37.starnet.cz) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[19:48:39] <gahr> it's been a while, isn't it?
[19:49:40] <ngortheone> For me it was like a week a go. My job takes most of my time, and I didn't have much time to look back and think :D
[19:49:58] <ngortheone> but yes, it was a while
[19:51:33] <ngortheone> What's new in neomutt world? Apart from the october release
[19:52:24] <gahr> a lot of refactoring, as usual
[19:52:33] <gahr> mostly by flatcap.. I haven't done much
[19:54:29] <ngortheone> well, you kept him company
[19:57:58] <gahr> :)

[20:13:23] <flatcap> hi ngortheone 
[20:15:59] <ngortheone> hey flatcap! Happy to see you! How are things?
[20:17:37] <flatcap> good thanks.  happily refactoring :-)
[20:17:46] <flatcap> here's my latest diagram https://flatcap.org/mutt/enter/g3-expanded.svg
[20:18:48] <ngortheone> looks smart. goes a bit over my head with no context. what is it about?
[20:19:39] <flatcap> that's all about a user entering a string.  the bold rings are the key bit
[20:20:14] <flatcap> I was trying to unbundle some more BIG switch's
[20:20:41] <flatcap> unfortunately entering a string becomes completing a string
[20:21:05] <flatcap> and completing a string becomes open-a-selection-dialog
[20:22:00] <ngortheone> decouple string completion from entering?
[20:22:00] <flatcap> I'd like to decouple the completion (where it branches wildly on the right) and reduces the deps on enter_string()
[20:22:06] <ngortheone> ^^^
[20:22:18] <flatcap> API it :-)
[20:22:55] <flatcap> the code for entering a string should be able to use the completion, but shouldn't know any details of who/where/how
[20:23:34] <ngortheone> matches what I think too
[20:24:17] <flatcap> the diagram shows all the data/flags (coloured blobs) that are passed around
[20:24:20] *** Joins: gabriel1_ (~gabriel1@host-95-239-6-20.retail.telecomitalia.it)
[20:25:25] <ngortheone> ideally each thing that can be completed presents a query like interface that can be plugged into a complete engine
[20:25:42] <ngortheone> there are probably existing C libraries for that too...
[20:26:08] <ngortheone> (for completion, I mean. Something like fzf)
[20:26:18] <flatcap> yeah
[20:26:32] *** Quits: gabriel1 (~gabriel1@user/gabriel1) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[20:26:52] <flatcap> people have asked for fzf integration before, but it's often not that simple
[20:27:15] <ngortheone> fzf is written in go, does it have a C interface?
[20:27:31] <flatcap> dunno
[20:27:47] <ngortheone> also, it is quite big, might be an overkill for what you need
[20:27:53] <flatcap> fzf works well with a simple list of items
[20:28:32] <flatcap> however, if you're selecting from a table of data, it's harded to use
[20:28:41] <flatcap> harder*
[20:29:50] <flatcap> Simon was working on a completion API that could handle fuzziness
[20:30:05] <flatcap> but I haven't heard from him in a while
