[00:21:17] <step1step2> Is mid-year review a thing in English?
[00:21:51] <blkshp> yep
[00:21:55] <step1step2> The other word I found is interim report
[00:22:35] <blkshp> It's company specific. Some companies do a yearly review or end of year review or monthly review or ... you get the idea.
[00:22:45] <step1step2> So when I write "My mid-year review is currently being created" it makes sense?
[00:23:03] <blkshp> Well it may need clarification. What is being created.
[00:23:05] <blkshp> Well it may need clarification. What is being created?
[00:24:20] <StayHungry> step1step2: semi-annual is another word
[00:24:52] <step1step2> It's hard for me to understand that because the German equivalent is very common. People request it to have a review to apply for another job or have an indication on how they are doing
[00:25:25] <blkshp> Yes, though here you do not use it generally to apply for another job.
[00:26:35] <blkshp> My Annual review means my manager has uploaded a series of questions that i need to answer to show how i have done, what i have done, what people think of me. Gather evidence and input it. Then we have a meeting to discuss it and out of that comes any recommendations or requirements for next year and a rating that is used to determine grade, pay, bonuses etc.

[00:27:02] <step1step2> How would you write that it's being created then?
[00:27:16] <blkshp> Well I still don't know what you mean by "created"
[00:27:25] <step1step2> Processed?
[00:27:33] <step1step2> Someone writes it 
[00:27:36] <step1step2> Usually HR
[00:27:45] <blkshp> "completed"
[00:28:00] <mdogg> Same thing goes with all of the organizations that I have worked for in America.  The review periods are static.  They may take place monthly, every 6-months, or annually.  There is no "requesting" of a performance review.  
[00:28:32] <blkshp> It's also frequently organisation specific
[00:28:41] <step1step2> mdogg: In that case it will confuse people when I say mine is being completed now?
[00:29:15] <step1step2> blkshp: So "My mid-year review is being completed" makes sense?
[00:29:18] <mdogg> No, it won't confuse people.  You could say, "I am about to receive a performance evaluation."

[20:59:33] <blkshp> But they're still manned incase you want to pay in store. (or buy booze!0
[20:59:36] <CuriosTiger> blkshp: The US has two states -- Oregon and New Jersey -- that insist on having people pump your gas for you. It's actually illegal in those states to pump gas without a license.
[20:59:57] <CuriosTiger> but completely unmanned stations are rare in the US. They're becoming common in Norway, though.
[21:00:19] <CuriosTiger> I imagine the difference in labor cost has something to do with it.
[21:00:35] <blkshp> Yeah I've read that.
[21:00:53] <CuriosTiger> and I would expect Finland to resemble Norway in that regard.
[21:01:00] <lall-> Pumping petrol by yourself. Somehow feels like a manly thing to do.
[21:01:50] <CuriosTiger> Eh. I just don't like having to wait.
[21:02:01] <lall-> That too.
[21:02:02] <StayHungry> funny things one could witness on non-staffed stations, e.g. https://coub.com/view/2wcu1s lol :)

[21:04:02] <lall-> Probably crashed it a moment later. I was in Japan few years ago, all the gas stations were "manned" by girls.
[21:04:19] <lall-> well, at least the ones I've been at.

[21:13:31] <CuriosTiger> When I was driving 18-wheelers, we had two pumps
[21:13:35] <CuriosTiger> one on either side of the truck
[21:13:41] <CuriosTiger> that way you could fuel about twice as fast.
[21:13:48] <blkshp> The store is always at the front.
[21:13:51] <CuriosTiger> (most US trucks also have fuel tanks on both sides for better range.)

[21:28:32] <gajus> Right.
[21:29:27] <TimMc> It's also possible that it's the result of a late edit.
[21:30:12] <TimMc> "...that Client will not carry..." Oh wait, we need to add Platform, better make that "neither Client or Platform"
[21:33:13] <lall-> Most likely it's copy pasted from some random source because they don't care. I'm having hard time believing "that" is coming from a top law firm in the world.
[21:33:19] <TimMc> lall-: It's enforceable, it just may require extra legal expenses and courtroom time if someone starts trying to weasel out from under that clause.
[21:34:15] <lall-> TimMc, reason allthose AUPs are so long is because of the details and attempt to get rid of ambiguity. 
[21:34:33] <lall-> If you write a sentence like that one above, that's full of ambiguity, how can you enforce that
[21:35:49] <lall-> Law, at least in the western world, is pretty 2 dimensional. Either it's stated, or it's not. Word salads don't work.

[22:35:41] <TimMc> lall-: It's more about shifting burden from the company onto the users.
[22:36:33] <TimMc> It doesn't cost the company much to write a huge, verbose contract that is unambiguous, but that the enduser will have no chance of reading and understanding.
[22:37:30] <TimMc> There's been a bit of a movement towards humanizing these things in recent years -- stating the terms almost entirely in plain language, and in much shorter documents.
[22:38:07] <TimMc> That's more work to create and potentially opens up some room for argument in court.
[22:38:59] <TimMc> However, it's also closer to being a real contract. Courts have sometimes thrown out these non-negotiated "contracts" (website terms of service and whatnot, clickwrap) because it's clear the users did not understand the terms.
[22:39:35] <TimMc> (Arguably, a contract can't be considered binding if both parties did not understand what they were agreeing to...)
[22:39:41] <lall-> there are these troll lawyers that are searching for badly worded terms and then bringing companies to court. People that are just looking for low hanging fruit, settlements.
[22:40:53] <lall-> I don't think AUP of any large company sohuld be accepted as binding... because you can't possibly expect a commonperson to read that garbage, and understand it too
