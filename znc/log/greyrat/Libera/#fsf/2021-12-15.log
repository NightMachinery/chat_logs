[13:22:32] <iShareFreedom> hello, what is the diference between linux-libre and linux version of debian official? both are cleaned of blobs right?
[13:22:51] <darwin> no; standard Linux has blobs
[13:24:28] <darwin> and unfortunately without alternative Free/Libre Software (FLS) drivers, most computers need those to even run. Just some slow/old or very expensive obscure PCs might run without them :(
[13:25:38] <darwin> because most hardware is closed :(  It's important to ask manufacturers to make open hardware
[13:25:49] <kilobug> iShareFreedom: darwin: the Linux version shipped in Debian main is stripped of blobs too; but unlike linux-libre version it does support the loading of blobs if they are provided manually (via packages from non-free or otherwise)
[13:26:27] <kilobug> if you just install linux-image-amd64 from Debian, you've no non-free blobs, and some drivers won't work
[13:26:28] <darwin> that must be somewhat new
[13:26:58] <darwin> but I haven't used Debian on desktop in about 20 years...
[13:27:17] <iShareFreedom> i say it, becouse we linux of debian ican use my cpu without installing nothing, but with linux-libre i cant 
[13:27:21] <kilobug> darwin: well, yes, it's newer than 20 years, but it has been the case since 2-3 releases, so since 6-9 years or so
[13:28:16] <iShareFreedom> so, icant use a cleaned linux of debian, but not linux-libre with my cpu/gpu integrated (and without installing nonfree firmware/drivers)
[13:28:30] <darwin> that's a good step but kind of a band-aid fix. It makes things difficult for users but not manufacturers. We really need to ask them. I've asked a few myself
[13:29:10] <iShareFreedom> is realy easy, i only flash the live official mate
[13:29:32] <iShareFreedom> and i can run fully free as in freedom "by defaul" i know debian arent a recommended distro
[13:29:52] <iShareFreedom> but, is intersting how i cant use linux-libre of trisquel for example, and i can use linux cleaned of debian.
[13:31:03] <kilobug> well, there is a kind of feud between Debian and FSF which in my view is unfortunate, I wish they worked together... Debian considers official GNU documentations to be non-free due to "invariant sections", and FSF considers Debian to be non-free due to Debian offering the "non-free" archive (even if disabled by default) to users who want to enable it
[13:31:31] <kilobug> IMHO it's wasting time and energy to fight each other on those tiny points while they basically agree with each other 99% of the time

[14:28:37] <hxx> But if a company was to use GIMP rather than photoshop, they would need to provide training for GIMP because photoshop is far more well known than GIMP.
[14:32:39] <kilobug> hxx: not sure if there are companies offering GIMP training, but you likely can find freelancers who will do it for a fee

[14:52:28] <DiffieHellman> Yeah sorry, I misread.
[14:52:47] <iShareFreedom> becouse the official kernel, dont have blobs, of nonfree software, and im interesting becouse i can run my pc with it, but no with linux-libre
[14:54:07] <DiffieHellman> Linux-libre should boot even on the most proprietary of AMD64 computers, but some computers don't boot certain Linux configurations for unknown reasons I've noticed.

[14:56:35] <DiffieHellman> The display mode won't go out of text mode if your GPU needs nonfree firmware for example, but it'll work. Stuff like usb 3.0 will work too, as the BIOS loads the nonfree usb3.0 firmware for you.
[14:59:59] <DiffieHellman> Linux-libre tends to patch out a lot of stuff kinda messily as well. The default kernel Debian releases is clean, the main reason not to use it is because it has almost everything compiled in, so it's quite bloated, so go for that if you don't mind that.

[16:05:19] <AndrewYu> Whistler: Which case is that? I actually live there, pretty interested
[16:05:26] <AndrewYu> Yes, the copyright laws are enforced
[16:06:09] <AndrewYu> I don't think court charges are that high, but I haven't went to court yet (heh). 
[16:06:59] <AndrewYu> might have found it, a 500,000 chinese yuan fine
[16:07:55] <AndrewYu> Crap, they use the term Open Source
[16:08:23] <GNUHacker> :/
[16:14:56] <AndrewYu> I'm unsure if there's a GPL violation, if the violator actually has to free the source, say composition into a larger program via linking and stuff. The plaintiff didn't request for the court to do that anyways
[16:15:12] <DiffieHellman> Franciman: Only nonfree licenses tend to make you agree to something just to use the software.
[16:15:53] <DiffieHellman> The {A}GPL's requirements only apply if you actually distribute the software in some way.
[16:15:54] <Franciman> :> right
[16:16:56] <AndrewYu> "开源"... I want to see 自由软件 instead
[16:18:32] <DiffieHellman> "If you use this software, you might agree to *something unacceptable in china*" is fine to go in the readme of course. 
[16:19:17] <AndrewYu> Of course
[16:19:27] <AndrewYu> Nobody can take in account for all the laws in every country
[16:19:37] <AndrewYu> And we always have the choice to *not* use some software
[16:20:15] <Franciman> AndrewYu: I want to avoid that some big company or state uses my software to harm people and not publish the source
[16:20:22] <Franciman> that's not specific to china, but to worldwide
[16:20:31] <Franciman> it's just that i find it difficult to ensure this in china
[16:20:38] <Franciman> while in europe it is easier, since I live in europe
[16:20:50] <AndrewYu> I understand that
[16:21:15] <AndrewYu> I keep trying to get my school to STOP REQUIRING * PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE BY USE BY STUDENTS, got some effect, but still bad
[16:21:16] <DiffieHellman> The only way you ensure that is to use copyright law, which china does enforce when it suits them. 
[16:21:17] <AndrewYu> *sigh*
[16:21:35] <Franciman> DiffieHellman: indeed,that's not enough :<
[16:22:33] <kilobug> iShareFreedom: for your "linux-libre doesn't boot issue" are you sure it's not something like a "secure boot" enabled in the bios refusing to boot an unsigned kernel ? Debian's stable kernels are signed
[16:22:55] <kilobug> AndrewYu: reminds me when RMS had to censor GNU Emacs :(
[16:24:21] <kilobug> DiffieHellman: and yeah basically the only thing a Free Software should tell the use beforehand is the "no warranty" disclaimer, all the rests are rights provided to the user if they want to use them, not conditions they have to accept
[16:24:56] <AndrewYu> The lack of clear separation of powers in China, eww
[16:25:37] <Franciman> thanks people
[16:25:43] <Franciman> this made me realise I don't want to release my software
[16:25:54] <Franciman> there is no acceptable solution
[16:25:55] <Franciman> for me
[16:26:07] <kilobug> AndrewYu: well, it's for USA that RMS had to censor GNU Emacs, not for China ;)
[16:26:15] <Franciman> kilobug: lol why?
[16:26:15] <kilobug> Franciman: uh ?
[16:26:31] <AndrewYu> kilobug: I'm not sure about that
[16:26:36] <AndrewYu> Reading the China GPL case
[16:26:43] <Franciman> why did RMS have to censor GNU Emacs?
[16:27:00] <DiffieHellman> There's nothing wrong with not releasing software, but I don't see how you came to that conclusion. 
[16:27:14] <kilobug> Franciman: M-x doctor contained a list of swearwords (like f*ck, ...) so it would answer appropriately (ie, "please be polite" or "don't get mad at me" or whatever)
[16:27:44] <Franciman> DiffieHellman: because I can't stand the possibility of not enforcing free software
[16:27:55] <Franciman> it means I am not guaranteeing things to some of my users
[16:28:04] <Franciman> of the users of my software I mean
[16:28:22] <Franciman> and as you correctly noted, adding binding terms like "you swear by non-chinese-things"
[16:28:24] <DiffieHellman> I doubt that someone in china will even come across the software unless its really something. 
[16:28:25] <Franciman> is awful
[16:28:31] <kilobug> Franciman: and that clashed with "anti-swearing" legilsations in some parts of USA, so RMS had to remove that list
[16:28:38] <Franciman> kilobug: lollolol thanks
[16:28:56] <Franciman> DiffieHellman: the whole point is that one
[16:29:04] <Franciman> if it becomes
[16:29:11] <Franciman> something important
[16:29:15] <Franciman> it fails its own goal
[16:29:27] <AndrewYu> Wow, a lower court said that "The GPL didn't apply in the plugins since they were in different directories that didn't include a LICENSE file to the GPL"
[16:29:33] <AndrewYu> Which is horrifyingly stupid
[16:29:38] <anton> are you saying any Chinese user *will* intentionally go against the license?
[16:29:40] <AndrewYu> (Obviously overtuned by a higher court)
[16:29:46] <Franciman> anton: no
[16:29:54] <kilobug> Franciman: not realising software because in some part of the world enforcing the (A)GPL is not an easy task seems a bit of an over-reaction to me, but it's your code, so your choice to release it or not
[16:29:55] <Franciman> I am saying that I can't enforce the license if someone does
[16:30:13] <kilobug> *releasing
[16:30:22] <anton> do you just not want to release it then?
[16:30:30] <Franciman> I am thinking about it
[16:30:34] * AndrewYu goes to come over all that software
[16:31:30] <Franciman> kilobug: i am writing a programming language compiler which produces assembly code that is automatically licensed under AGPLv3
[16:31:38] <AndrewYu> 20:57 <DiffieHellman> I doubt that someone in china will even come across the software unless its really something. -- which software are you talking about?
[16:31:47] <Franciman> my software AndrewYu 
[16:31:50] <anton> if you really want, you could assign copyright to the FSF, might deal with enforcement
[16:31:51] <Franciman> this is correct
[16:31:54] <AndrewYu> Franciman: I don't think output from a program can be licensed automatically by the program
[16:32:03] <Franciman> that's my license
[16:32:12] <Franciman> why can't it?
[16:32:37] <AndrewYu> https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLOutput
[16:32:37] <anton> isn't that what patents do?
[16:33:05] <Franciman> holy shit
[16:33:28] <AndrewYu> Probably wanna read copyright law and the FAQs more carefully
[16:33:35] <AndrewYu> That also applies in China, btw
[16:33:41] <Franciman> ahahah
[16:33:43] <Franciman> i deserve that
[16:33:48] <AndrewYu> lol
[16:34:05] <DiffieHellman> AndrewYu: It depends on the output. Normal output is generally never GPL licensed. Really special output that includes non-trivial code that's GL covered, is covered by the GPL though. 
[16:34:05] <Franciman> but this is the only way I can think of to kill the power of huge corps 
[16:34:21] <AndrewYu> DiffieHellman: Yup
[16:34:26] <Franciman> they mustn't be able to use the tools
[16:34:29] <Franciman> at all
[16:34:32] <Franciman> to do nonfree tuff
[16:34:37] *** Joins: lorimer (~lorimer@user/lorimer)
[16:34:42] <AndrewYu> You are making a compiler to make compilers?
[16:34:51] <AndrewYu> Ugh, I'm a bit confused 
[16:34:59] <DiffieHellman> The only way to ensure that is to enforce the GPL relentlessly.
[16:35:03] <Franciman> mine is a proof of concept
[16:35:17] <Franciman> i wanted to write a language that can't be used by corps 
[16:35:30] <Franciman> and i know the solution is writing a language that sucks and is useless
[16:35:32] <Franciman> ahah
[16:35:35] <Franciman> but suppose somebody else has a good idea
[16:35:40] <AndrewYu> Franciman: Then it's not free software, if you explicitly say so, violates freedom #0
[16:35:48] <AndrewYu> Would think about that
[16:35:51] <DiffieHellman> AndrewYu: I'll give an example; gcc's normal output is not covered by the GPL, but gcc can also output a bootstrap or whatever library, but gcc has an exception for that case.
[16:36:08] <Franciman> so I just need to add personal stuff into the output
[16:36:11] <Franciman> very well
[16:36:20] <Franciman> AndrewYu: corps can use it as soon as the assembly is AGPLv3
[16:36:25] <Franciman> i think this is reasonable
[16:36:34] <AndrewYu> True
[16:36:35] <Franciman> it's just that corps are hungry for money and power
[16:36:41] <Franciman> so practically they won't use it
[16:36:47] <AndrewYu> *Capitalism* *sigh*

[16:37:01] <anton> so you're making a compiler that compiles compilers that has AGPLv3 output?
[16:37:02] <DiffieHellman> The best way to prevent corps from illegally uses free software to make proprietary software is to relentlessly enforce the GPL.
[16:37:04] <AndrewYu> I've got mixed thoughts on capitalism, but yeah, corps nowadays are ewwww
[16:37:05] <anton> or am I getting confused
[16:37:16] <AndrewYu> DiffieHellman: Understandable
[16:37:20] <DiffieHellman> Google does not touch AGPLv3 code.
[16:37:46] <Franciman> anton: a compiler for my language
[16:37:49] <AndrewYu> (I'm not sure if corps as we know them should even exist)
[16:37:49] <Franciman> as I said this is a proof of concept
[16:37:54] <Franciman> that if others like, could use too
[16:38:04] <Franciman> and so we develop a lot of nice languages that corps can't use for their dirty business

[16:38:38] <AndrewYu> Franciman: Side question: Are you designing a language, like a conceptual idea, or a implementation of an existing language, or an implementation of a new concept language? And how's the language different from existing ones?
[16:38:39] <DiffieHellman> Less and less corps are going to try to violate the GPL if dozens and dozens get there asses handed to them. 
[16:38:47] <Franciman> my own language
[16:38:55] <AndrewYu> DiffieHellman: We might not have enough money though
[16:38:56] <Franciman> DiffieHellman: I totally agree
[16:39:05] <DiffieHellman> Franciman: Please do not design yet another useless language, just use C.
[16:39:09] <Franciman> but we could do a further step
[16:39:10] <AndrewYu> DiffieHellman: A big problem with the legal system is-
[16:39:14] <AndrewYu> NO, NO C
[16:39:24] <AndrewYu> (Personal opinion) (Fire mode... ON)
[16:39:27] <Franciman> and put a gun to their head because they can't use the nice tools
[16:39:27] <DiffieHellman> C is the best language, what else is there?
[16:39:35] <Franciman> they have to make their tools
[16:39:36] <AndrewYu> Imperative programming languages are a mess
[16:39:40] <Franciman> but they can't resemble our nice tools
[16:39:45] <Franciman> or AGPLv3 bites their arse
[16:39:53] <Franciman> so they must give up
[16:39:55] <AndrewYu> Some people like imperative, some people (me!) like functional, some like object oriented
[16:40:13] <DiffieHellman> A email that looks like it comes from a lawyer (or even one that actually does) isn't all that expensive.

[16:40:35] <AndrewYu> Yes, but FP won't be.
[16:40:42] <Franciman> i care about tying their hands

[16:41:05] <AndrewYu> DiffieHellman: Functional programming, especially Haskell and some lisp styles
[16:41:25] <AndrewYu> Franciman: Investigate if your core idea is even copyrightable
[16:41:53] <Franciman> if we seize the means of productions
[16:41:56] <Franciman> corps can't produce
[16:42:02] <Franciman> stop consumism
[16:42:04] <Franciman> ahh
[16:42:05] <AndrewYu> If you're trying to design a new language specification, it's probably considered an Abstract Idea, not patentable (won't be nice to do so anyway), not copyrightable (though you can copyright your exact expression of that)

[16:45:19] *** Joins: lethu (~lethu@user/lethu)
[16:45:35] <DiffieHellman> Just the "source code" is just the ideals of "open source".
[16:45:55] <anton> that new language is all good until Amazon, Meta, or Google decides to make something in it, then what will happen to it?
[16:46:13] <DiffieHellman> Google is currently legally bound to provide the source code of all free software that it distributes even so.
[16:46:14] <Franciman> anton: they will be legally bound to release the assembly of their stuff
[16:46:18] <AndrewYu> DiffieHellman: I think Franciman also means that you get freedom 0, 2 and 3 along with 1
[16:47:03] <Franciman> google won't be able to use the language, so they will try to make their own copy
[16:47:17] <AndrewYu> Franciman: I strongly recommend investigating if the thing you're thinking of now could be effectively copyrightable, i.e., it is not an abstract idea or such.  
[16:47:20] <Franciman> but the code of the compiler is AGPLv3
[16:47:29] <Franciman> so they are screwd
[16:47:37] <Franciman> they can't use the new tech
[16:47:48] <Franciman> and hopefully all new more advanced techs continue to use this paradigm
[16:47:48] <AndrewYu> They can read the source, get the idea, and write their own from scratch
[16:47:55] <Franciman> and corps are left with old and dumb languages
[16:47:58] <anton> that an AGPLv3 theoretical compiler mean AGPLv3 software?
[16:48:07] <AndrewYu> anton: Nope
[16:48:44] <DiffieHellman> Compiler output is not copyrightable unless that output contains part of the compiler for some reason.
[16:48:54] <AndrewYu> Exactly
[16:49:05] <AndrewYu> Well, not exactly
[16:49:23] <AndrewYu> Compiler output is not copyright the compiler authors unless ...
[16:49:25] *** Joins: tesseract (~tesseract@user/tesseract)
[16:50:12] <Franciman> if we make all means of productions produce agplv3 code
[16:50:14] <AndrewYu> We're trying hard to do some things, but obviously, the current legal system prevents us from accomplishing some goals
[16:50:15] <Franciman> corps are left without
[16:50:25] <anton> corps will find new ways to monitize
[16:50:32] <AndrewYu> Franciman: Please speak complete sentences
[16:50:37] <DiffieHellman> Or just write the program, AGPLv3 it and enforce it...
[16:50:42] <AndrewYu> anton: That won't be a reason to not try what Franciman proposes though
[16:51:15] <Franciman> i personally always use agplv3 for my projects now
[16:51:20] <AndrewYu> Well, some GPL violations (like linking ZFS and Linux) are not evil (i hope so), but are legal problems
[16:51:44] <AndrewYu> Franciman: agpl3 only, or agpl3 and at your option, any later version
[16:52:22] <DiffieHellman> The ZFS thing depends entirely on the ZFS license. The ZFS people could get that issue fixed by adopting a compatible license and getting everyone to agree, but they won't.
[16:52:55] <AndrewYu> DiffieHellman: Not everyone would agree with GPL compatible licenses
[16:53:17] <DiffieHellman> That's fine, you can replace their code thanks to git logs.
[16:53:38] <Franciman> anyways thank you all
[16:53:45] <anton> nothing stops big tech companies from AGPLing their code, cleanrooming out 3rd party licensed code, and making a big deal about "we love 'open source'" (term 'open source' used since that's what companies seem to prefer)
[16:53:47] <Franciman> i think this is really hard
[16:53:48] <AndrewYu> DiffieHellman: Can you elaborate?
[16:54:11] <AndrewYu> Franciman: thanks for letting me (us) know that some people have these ideas lol
[16:54:38] <DiffieHellman> You can use git to mark out who wrote each line of the program and mark out lines from someone who hasn't agreed
[16:54:49] <Franciman> git is not agplv3
[16:54:49] <AndrewYu> anton: Companies (mostly) run on commercial/monetery interest, afaik
[16:54:59] <anton> true
[16:55:32] <Franciman> am I wrong or if git were agplv3 or later, github and microsoft acquiring it would not be possible?
[16:55:34] <AndrewYu> And also, some companies are taking GNU/Linux and other projects in a direction that many would question
[16:55:50] <DiffieHellman> Big tech companies prefer proprietary licenses with the source released under the proprietary license.
[16:56:03] <anton> it is more profitable to keep things closed (the most closed probably being SaaSS since there isn't even a binary to inspect)
[16:56:22] <AndrewYu> Franciman: Git is not AGPLv3, we're saying that we could rewrite the part of the program by the developers who don't agree w/ a new license
[16:56:41] <AndrewYu> I don't think the software industry (or anything in general) should be based on profit
[16:56:46] <Franciman> yes I understood, sorry I asked another qustio
[16:56:53] <DiffieHellman> Franciman: github would just need to release the whole lot as AGPLv3 if they decided to use git and not a simple replacememnt instead
[16:57:10] <DiffieHellman> *if git was AGPLv3
[16:57:18] <Franciman> damn you linus
[16:57:35] * AndrewYu has also read https://unixsheikh.com/articles/the-problems-with-the-gpl.html, which made him confused
[16:58:02] <AndrewYu> "While we could say that the GPL is created on the premise that people are generally selfish and evil, and will never contribute back unless forced to, it doesn't solve the problem and it doesn't help. What we need is a license that operates on the premise that people are generally decent, and that many will contribute back on principle and goodness. Then we need to educate and set good examples,
[16:58:03] <anton> I've read that too
[16:58:04] <AndrewYu> avoid and shun greed, and I strongly believe we will get the best results by using a more permissive license than the GPL." 
[16:58:38] <DiffieHellman> There's nothing wrong with prioritising profit as long as you don't produce proprietary software.
[16:58:41] <AndrewYu> Strategically, might want to first start out with everything GPLey and that, then might move on to something like PD (public domain) once people don't get that greedy (might be of time \infty)
[16:58:48] <DiffieHellman> Most money is in support generally though.

[17:05:58] <DiffieHellman> 3>You cannot sell GPL licensed software Yes you can, as distributing for a fee is what proprietary software.
[17:06:07] <DiffieHellman> *tends to do as well
[17:06:16] * anton also couldn't figure out networking or why netbsd was having issues on my vps
[17:06:29] <DiffieHellman> luca0N: Gentoo doesn't actually ship any proprietary software out of the box for nor.
[17:06:54] <luca0N> what about Firefox? it contains binary blobs for DRM afaik
[17:07:02] <DiffieHellman> Gentoo doesn't ship firefox.
[17:07:04] <AndrewYu> DiffieHellman: Probably that means it's not practical to profit from GPL software, but I agree that selling is possible (in fact I did so for my own software, in exchange for a classmate paying me 2$ lunch fee at the cafeteria) 
[17:07:08] <DiffieHellman> Gentoo doesn't even ship Linux.

[17:08:05] <AndrewYu> Compiling Linux-libre isn't that hard
[17:08:08] <AndrewYu> True
[17:08:15] <DiffieHellman> GLFS is like Gentoo, but bad.
[17:09:37] <anton> not to change the subject, but are there any web browsers with GPL or AGPL rendering engines?
[17:09:45] <anton> preferably agpl
[17:10:08] <AndrewYu> The web is bloated and mostly proprietary, probably not afaik
[17:10:19] <AndrewYu> gecko is probably mpl
[17:10:24] <DiffieHellman> netsurf (MIT+GPL)
[17:10:27] <luca0N> maybe something akin to lynx?
[17:10:37] <luca0N> some TUI web browser
[17:10:48] <DiffieHellman> Firefox is tri licensed under MPL/GPL/other if I remember correctly.
[17:11:02] <anton> Firefox has some other issues though
[17:11:04] <DiffieHellman> lynx is GPLv2
[17:11:36] <AndrewYu> DiffieHellman: Do you have time to explain other reasons you disagree w/ the unixsheikh article?
[17:12:02] <DiffieHellman> Not really, but I can make a general comment.
[17:12:27] <AndrewYu> Oh, thanks
[17:13:05] <DiffieHellman> The unixsheikh article puts down the GPL and champions pushover licenses for cases where the GPL is giving the intended result. 
[17:13:47] <DiffieHellman> The article is also poorly researched, as he says that dynamic linking can be used to evade the GPLv2's requirements, when it cannot.
[17:14:20] <DiffieHellman> The end part sounds like complaining that companies aren't getting handouts to me.

[17:22:05] <luca0N> DiffieHellman: one more question regarding Gentoo: what about packages with blobs, like Blender (which comes with CUDA binaries by default unless you disable it at compile time)?
[17:22:41] <AndrewYu> luca0N: You compile everything by yourself in Gentoo
[17:22:47] <AndrewYu> So disable that at compile time?
[17:23:25] <iShareFreedom> so, the diference between linux-libre and debian linux kernel cleaned, is the block to run nonfree drivers like a possibility?
[17:23:43] <AndrewYu> It is possible, but that defeats the purpose of linux-libre
[17:24:09] <AndrewYu> (I mean, *anything* is possible, the system is turing complete)
[17:24:16] <iShareFreedom> so both, are equal in terms of freedom right?
[17:24:21] <AndrewYu> No
[17:24:25] <iShareFreedom> why?
[17:24:35] <iShareFreedom> both dont have nonfree drivers/firmware right?

[17:24:54] <AndrewYu> Hmm?
[17:24:54] <joelkraehemann> hi all
[17:24:55] <luca0N> AndrewYu: I'm OK with disabling these for packages like Blender, I was more concerned about dependencies
[17:24:56] <iShareFreedom> im speaking about linux cleaned by debian
[17:25:00] <jxself> The "purpose" of Linux-libre is not to block running proprietary junk. That's actually a bug in Linux-libre.
[17:25:11] <iShareFreedom> im speaking about linux official of debian gnu/linux
[17:25:23] <iShareFreedom> the linux of debian dont have blobs AndrewYu
[17:25:41] <AndrewYu> IDK how the debian one works
[17:25:53] <iShareFreedom> aah, say that in the first time 
[17:26:24] <iShareFreedom> im making a question, the diference of debian linux kernel cleaned (official without nonfree software) and linux-libre
[17:27:36] <AndrewYu> I'd suggest asking in #Debian here on on OFTC
[17:29:21] <jxself> Linux-libre targets being FSDG-compatible. Debian does not.
[17:29:57] <jxself> That makes certain issues in-scope for Linux-libre and not for Debian.
[17:30:17] <jxself> Also, this seems a little like asking the difference between a kernel from kernel.org and a distribution kernel. Linux-libre targets being a replacement for kernel.org; so usable for everyone on all distros - not being a specific distribution kernel. So that is also a difference.

[18:01:38] <jxself> Some of them claim to be under the GPL already, Funny huh?
[18:01:43] <jxself> And yet where is their source code?
[18:01:46] <jxself> Nowhere!
[18:02:30] <jxself> "...however, that a number of drivers and corresponding firwmare are updated in lockstep suggests that they might actually be a single program, in spite of running on separate CPUs and having pieces distributed separately, and it might even be the case that the firmware happens to be a derivative work of the kernel..."
[18:02:49] <AndrewYu> Linus doesn't really care abbout free software
[18:02:55] <jxself> Right!
[18:03:39] <jxself> That right there shows the need for Linux-libre, since Linus does not care. So the need for a FSDG-compliant replacement of kernel.org for people to use instead.
[18:03:44] <AndrewYu> He chooses the GPL because of the Open Source stuff, since he just wants faster code development and what not
[18:03:56] <jxself> Yes. That's not news. :)
