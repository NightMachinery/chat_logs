[00:12:05] <berz3rk> hey guys
[00:12:11] <berz3rk> anyone online
[00:12:23] <matsaman> yeah...
[00:12:28] <matsaman> caught us
[00:12:28] <berz3rk> nice how are you man
[00:12:40] <matsaman> okay, ye?
[00:12:42] <berz3rk> :)
[00:12:45] <berz3rk> ready for my problem?
[00:13:00] <berz3rk> :O
[00:13:45] <berz3rk> I have a dropdown box and my requirement is that if the content is longer then one can fit into one line, I want to display a flexbox not only 50% but the whole width. is such behaviour possible in css only?
[00:15:19] <matsaman> so you want something like a 'select'
[00:15:32] <matsaman> but if the content is larger than a single line, for it to span all available width?
[00:15:33] <berz3rk> this image is good :)

[00:15:43] <berz3rk> https://i.imgur.com/QpmfQ97.png
[00:16:13] <berz3rk> keep 50% if the content is only taking one line but when it overflows into next line instead use 100% width
[00:16:26] <berz3rk> this is not possible with pure css afaik
[00:16:27] <berz3rk> ?
[00:17:16] <matsaman> not sure why you'd want to do that
[00:17:22] <matsaman> you could probably use @media queries to hack it
[00:17:26] *** Joins: Kocho (~Kocho@user/kocho)
[00:17:30] <matsaman> don't think I would
[00:21:32] <berz3rk> this is a box
[00:21:45] <berz3rk> and we want to use 50% if its a color variation
[00:21:53] <berz3rk> and if its more content we want to have all available space for that
[00:22:01] <berz3rk> 50% and 100% looks better than just 100% or just 50%
[00:22:26] <berz3rk> how could a media query solve it, it depends on content not on viewport
[00:23:21] <matsaman> doesn't matter I wouldn't recommend it
[00:23:44] <berz3rk> if you look at my image
[00:23:58] <berz3rk> it makes sense I guess?
[00:24:34] <matsaman> I look at your image and wonder why so little text is wrapped at all
[00:24:42] <matsaman> (at right)
[00:25:14] <berz3rk> imagine
[00:25:16] <berz3rk> its a color
[00:25:35] <berz3rk> we want to have one component adept to content of variation
[00:25:41] <berz3rk> not set it manualy
[00:36:29] <matsaman> a solid color would work fine, there'd be no wrapping
[00:42:10] <berz3rk> thanks have a good night
[00:42:17] <matsaman> & you

[05:30:10] <momus> what am I doing wrong here: https://imgur.com/vRiz0Kp
[05:30:33] <momus> just applied display: inline-block; to all the div elements, and one doesn't seem to fit into the margins like the others?
[05:33:07] <pavonia> inline-block aligns by baseline (the last baseline of text in that element) by default

[19:19:35] <wombawomba> alright, thanks
[19:20:11] <wombawomba> I guess I'll go with grid then because I want to support line wrapping

[19:25:39] <wombawomba> eh, I think it's fine tbh
[19:25:43] <wombawomba> grid seems to do the trick
[19:26:13] <wombawomba> Is there going to be any performance difference between using classes and nth-child selectors to style the columns?

[19:27:49] <hassoon> nth-child gets you one specific element, class might give you alot
[19:28:33] <wombawomba> I was thinking nth-child(2n) and nth-child(2n + 1)
[19:29:23] <wombawomba> all cells in each column will have the same styling
