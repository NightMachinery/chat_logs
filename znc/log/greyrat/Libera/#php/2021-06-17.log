[00:04:51] <AllenJB> Yes (in PHP 5 you basically had to if you wanted to do anything with errors other than log to file or display a basic message on screen).
[00:06:41] <biberu> sstory: can you restructure it to avoid loading so much data at once?
[00:08:11] <sstory> Maybe. Dates are user driven begindate/enddate. The user is smart enough not to request too much, but if it bombs out it shows no error. I just want to catch it and say, "hey..that returned too much information." or some error rather than nothing.
[00:08:15] <sstory> It looks like nothing happened.
[00:08:50] <sstory> Here's the original try catch. It never gets to the second Exception (which AllenJB explained why) https://3v4l.org/umoLU#focus=5.4.0
[00:09:59] <sstory> I put this in the code way about that and the starting db code https://3v4l.org/mXUsX#focus=5.4.0, but it still doesn't seem to report the fatal error.

[00:10:30] <sstory> Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 1073741824 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 87 bytes) in [pathnamehere]/index.php on line 795
[00:10:58] <sstory> I don't plan to allow them to show that much, I just wanted to catch it and show the problem.
[00:12:09] <biberu> sstory: i don't know what you're doing, but apart from failing gracefully in case of an error like that, it's not really unexpected that a user requests ranges that are too large to handle
[00:13:21] <biberu> sstory: perhaps you could e.g. process whatever you're doing as a stream or having your application abort if it goes above limits, before php crashes it
[00:13:38] <sstory> In short, I have an internal site that hits a database. The user can choose from a dropdown of stored procedures which may get more in the future. They choose the proc and give begin and end date and hit Execute
[00:13:45] <sstory> Results show dynamically in a grid below.
[00:14:28] <biberu> limit it while informing the user that the full set couldn't be loaded?
[00:14:52] <AllenJB> Rather than trying to process the entire date range in a single query, you could try to process it in batches (eg. 1 week at a time)
[00:15:24] <biberu> yeah, or x rows, whatever makes sense and isn't boundless
[00:15:26] <AllenJB> You should also check you're only requesting the data (columns) from the database you're actually using (avoid SELECT * )
[00:16:31] <sstory> Ok. I have found where it blows up, but not sure how to test before to know that it will or won't. Getting to array from PDO,     $data = $procStmt->fetchAll();
[00:17:07] <biberu> whatever strategy you choose something like that would leave your application in control of execution, rather than crashing (even if you could crash in a prettier way ^^)
[00:17:12] <sstory> That blows it up because it is more than allowed RAM. Each query could have 3 columns or 20 columns and unknown number of rows
[00:18:05] <biberu> sure, don't call ->fetchTheKnownUniverse(), fetch a bit at a time
[00:18:22] <sstory> I am sure you guys are correct. It would probably mean rewriting every single stored proc to allow specification of a beginning row, ending row
[00:19:09] <biberu> might require some restructuring, yeah
[00:19:32] <sstory> 90% of the time they want the data they ask for and then export to CSV so I am not sure worth the trouble. I am just curious why the error handler doesn't catch that
[00:20:40] <AllenJB> When PHP hits the memory limit, it simply stops the script (there's nothing it could usefully do anyway, especially when there's < 87 bytes left).
[00:20:58] *** Quits: genom (~g@37.214.77.184) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:22:21] <sstory> OK.
[00:22:29] <AllenJB> If you have the resources you could increase the memory limit just for that script (memory_limit can be set at runtime). Obviously if multiple people request multiple reports at once you could exhaust all system memory anyway, but that's always a risk.
[00:23:07] <sstory> 32GB, 14GB currently free.
[00:24:05] <sstory> I bumped it to 5GB
[00:24:07] <AllenJB> (You could use locks / counters to limit the number of reports being processed at once)
[00:24:32] <sstory> There will only be one or two people processing it a few times a day. Not a big thing.
[00:25:05] <AllenJB> And if this is generating CSVs, move that to a backend process and use a job queue, then you can use the number of queue workers to control the number of simultaneous jobs
[00:25:26] <sstory> cool idea. Thanks!

[01:54:41] <Lutin> da_wunder did what ?
[01:55:11] <ramsey> Lutin: That’s what “KISS” means: “keep it simple, stupid.” The “stupid” is addressing whomever you’re saying it too as “stupid.”
[01:55:50] <Lutin> ramsey no, you want to read this maybe because your mindset is like it ? Keep Chat Stupid Simple... It=The chat
[01:55:51] <da_wunder> Lutin: cannot see what this mean - 00:18 < ramsey> Lutin: what do you mean?
[01:56:04] <Lutin> da_wunder doesn't matter really
[01:56:32] <Lutin> ramsey KISS is a way of working, a smart way tho... you are right about that ;)

[01:57:21] <ramsey> Oh, you say it backwards from how I’ve always heard the expression. I’ve always heard it as “keep it simple, stupid.”
[01:58:03] <Lutin> ramsey aha, so we tackled that issue right away... it way you! :P
[01:58:11] <ramsey> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle
[01:58:15] <Lutin> Now we see how fake news starts... ;)
[01:58:23] <da_wunder> Lutin: I'm not for the "drama" I was just interested to see the topic there - nothing else
[01:58:33] <ramsey> Read the Wikipedia entry :-)
[01:59:28] <ramsey> Hence why I understood it that way. It’s considered a mean-spirited statement, where I come from.
[01:59:29] <da_wunder> and for that KISS - I have always tell that Keep It Simple Stupid - and that is something that should not insult anyone - and if that is the use case then I would just explain that term
[01:59:32] <Lutin> ramsey... you are talking about the Navy... lots of people don't have a real high degree there, and that is with a reason... they need to keep them stupid otherwise they start to ask question while they are being deligated...
[01:59:40] <Lutin> We are in IT, KISS is different there.
[02:00:15] <ramsey> Anyway, I think there are better ways of saying the same thing without using the word “stupid.”
[02:00:36] <Lutin> anyways, not the discussion, keep the right friendly and productive one in mind for the next time :D
[02:00:46] <da_wunder> Lutin: also remember that you should teach people - that is called team work
[02:00:52] <Lutin> ramsey stupid is known as damn simple
[02:00:59] <Lutin> so just not to think about simple
[02:01:06] <Lutin> like walking
[02:01:20] <Lutin> if you start to think about walking too much... you fall
[02:01:39] <Lutin> it's a known concept
[02:01:51] <Lutin> anyways, offtopic, you know what people mean now when they want to KISS you :D

[02:08:06] <entuland> do you have other examples out of that dataset, Northwoods? looking at it again there seems to be just too much data there
[02:08:17] <entuland> unless that trailing 08:00 is the timezone
[02:08:26] <__adrian> it's the offset (not timezone)
[02:08:35] <entuland> offset from what?
[02:08:39] <__adrian> from 0
[02:08:44] <Northwoods> meaning ?
[02:08:46] <entuland> isn't that the same as a timezone?
[02:08:49] <__adrian> no
[02:08:54] <__adrian> timezones are geographic
[02:09:03] <__adrian> *goepolitical
[02:09:13] <__adrian> time offsets are just a number of hours:mintues
[02:09:18] <entuland> okay, what I meant is that the 08:00 means "8 hours ahead of GMT or something"
[02:09:19] <__adrian> *minutes
[02:09:58] <entuland> either way, if that's the case, you should be able to parse those entries with the docs specs, Northwoods
[02:10:05] <__adrian> of UTC
[02:10:40] <entuland> actually, that's -08:00, correct?
[02:10:46] <Northwoods> entuland, records from dataset that i can see , all have same value
[02:11:04] <__adrian> in your example? yes
[02:11:09] <__adrian> it will be - or +
[02:11:18] <__adrian> but don't parse this yourself. use DateTime
[02:11:21] <entuland> cool, thanks for the clarification
[02:11:31] <entuland> yep, definitely use the facilities Northwoods
[02:11:58] <Northwoods> __adrian, i see
[02:12:12] <Northwoods> DateTime::createFromFormat(
[02:12:23] <__adrian> yes
[02:12:24] <da_wunder> I recommend all watch this - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY
[02:12:51] <da_wunder> classic clip - and make you realize that you really don't want do that yourself
[02:14:02] <Northwoods> this is ISO 8601 format , isn't that what we call it  ?
[02:14:24] <__adrian> 8601 is not one single format
[02:14:31] <__adrian> it's a spec
[02:15:38] <Northwoods> $now = new DateTime("2014-03-13T09:05:50.240Z");
[02:15:38] <Northwoods> echo $now->format('Y-m-d');
[02:15:54] <da_wunder> yep with that timezone could be different - if I remember that correctly
[02:16:53] <__adrian> using the constructor should work, BUT if you know the format there's no reason to. and don't use the constructor with user input or any other case where you don't _know_ the format is going to be parsed correctly
[02:17:07] <da_wunder> assuming that __adrian mean with "single format" that the format is locked eg. utc time

[17:57:21] <Lutin> biberu jquery is great, people that want to act fancy don't agree indeed
[18:01:30] <biberu> Lutin: well, what are you using it for? if it solves a problem for you then great, but i don't have any need for it
[18:02:53] <Lutin> biberu for all kinds of javascript things, no..not the datepicker as jquery-ui is outdated, it's just easy syntax, so why not ?
[18:03:03] <biberu> Lutin: animations are mostly css, don't need the xhr or dom querying features these days, it shouldn't be used to manage state if you're building something on it, and if you're using plugins as part of another application you need to hook those into the lifecycles of that, etc. etc.

[18:04:46] <Lutin> sure, because it's vector, can't be better!
[18:05:34] <meta-tag> Hi simple question for you guys how to add time , data of entry on every new entry save in file
[18:05:37] <meta-tag> fwrite($fp, $ipaddress);
[18:05:40] <biberu> and it can be problematic when people try to use jquery to build larger applications, when they should really use something that manages state for them, and not build everything in the dom
[18:05:44] <BadAdviceCat> Lutin, jQuery works, it's just that nowadays, we can write javascript without jQuery. Since Javascript has improved a lot as far as syntax consistency is concerned.
[18:06:09] <biberu> Lutin: if you've got an otherwise static page and just need a datepicker, then ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[18:06:40] <Lutin> BadAdviceCat indeed you can but I don't like the vanilla syntax, as many other do the same
[18:06:49] <biberu> Lutin: not to mention that i hardly write plain js either, i just compile to it
[18:07:11] <Lutin> biberu depends if your browser supports datepickers natively
[18:07:29] <Lutin> but there are nice libs who can have nice settings

[18:08:17] <biberu> it does
[18:08:17] <Lutin> you can't debate that

[18:08:24] <Lutin> you try to
[18:08:28] <biberu> no :)
[18:08:49] <Lutin> yes because you disagree with someone who disagrees with you
[18:08:57] <Lutin> that starts a conversation
[18:09:07] <Lutin> but we stop it now because it's offtopic ;)
[18:09:07] <BadAdviceCat> Then there is npm, and javascript import/export module syntax. I do not know how far jQuery is to being able to make use of JS modules, but writing JS in terms of ES modules are pretty important.
[18:09:37] <BadAdviceCat> Instead of the classic spaghetti style global variables everywhere approach.
[18:09:42] <biberu> Lutin: perhaps i misinterpreted "... people that want to act fancy don't agree ..."? anyway, yes, this is off topic and i don't wish to argue over it
[18:10:01] <Lutin> biberu ah sure... you want to end like that haha!

[18:33:37] <de-facto> how to make a date out of date_parse() ?

[18:38:39] <AllenJB> de-facto: I generally use DateTime(Immutable)::createFromFormat()
[18:39:52] <AllenJB> Note that all date/times must have a timezone or offset and if you don't specify one, then PHP will use the default (see date_default_timezone_set() / the date.timezone ini setting)
[18:40:21] <de-facto> i explicitely do not want it to apply any timezone info
[18:40:53] <de-facto> just parse and use as it is, i have to guarantee that it never will be converted to a different date (e.g. due to timezone)
[18:41:51] <AllenJB> You could specify UTC as the timezone or give it a specific UTC offset
