[20:24:18] <companion_cube> I hear that a lot of people coming from python and ruby try Go

[20:24:29] <companion_cube> and then python just feels sluggish
[20:24:40] <companion_cube> tbh right now I'm using `gsutil` and it's so fucking slow to load, I hate it
[20:24:49] <rb> majority of python feeling sluggish is pip feeling sluggish
[20:24:54] <technomancy> that was a big thing when people switched from ruby to node too believe it a lot
[20:25:22] <c355E3B> IMO not enough people care to spend the time to really learn how to optimize things.

[20:26:45] <rb> i wonder whether that can be improved without breaking stuff...
[20:26:49] <technomancy> people decide to do things and then make up reasons why retroactively

[20:26:54] <technomancy> programmers aren't unique in this

[20:27:29] <ngoldbaum> in my experience a very small fraction of the codebase tends to be performance critical
[20:27:41] <technomancy> in reality people were tired of ruby and somehow thought it was fun to use node (??! man the 00s were weird) but they told everyone they were doing it because "async is fast"

[20:58:03] <ngoldbaum> everyone else: nah
[20:58:04] <oz> lots of folks think that there's nothing after JS, that's why we get experiments like gemini. It's easier to replace the browser at this point.
[20:58:22] <Xe> Gemini is pretty good
[20:58:30] <edk> gemini seems pretty cheap to me
[20:58:42] <oz> Xe: I agree. :)
[20:58:45] <Xe> it just needs an easier way to use for less technically apt people

[20:59:22] <edk> the web is too complicated! let's replace it with something simple! oh and also that simple thing won't solve any of the problems the web's complexity solves
[20:59:23] <technomancy> gemini is specifically designed to be exclusionary so that seems unlikely
[20:59:28] <companion_cube> I mean wasm would be nice
[20:59:34] <companion_cube> if it got GC and DOM support
