[00:03:43] <nobyk> no u
[00:03:47] <nobyk> hah got em
[00:07:31] <AnonymooseReddtr> only 2 hr??
[00:07:38] <AnonymooseReddtr> i'm prepping for a workshop next week 
[00:07:41] <AnonymooseReddtr> 3 fucking days of me talking
[00:07:43] <AnonymooseReddtr> blah blah blah
[00:08:24] <MarsSpiral> wtf lol
[00:08:27] <vinrock> the only time i had to hold workshops i was too hungover to accomplish anything
[00:08:34] <MarsSpiral> recruiter just hit me up for top hedge fund 
[00:08:40] <MarsSpiral> i guess my resume looks good or something
[00:08:45] <vinrock> yeah
[00:08:50] <vinrock> go work for THE MAN
[00:09:03] <MarsSpiral> honestly i dont think i have the personality for those places
[00:09:10] <MarsSpiral> but fuck it ill apply anyway to see
[00:09:32] <MarsSpiral> my guess is, insanely stressful but pays fuckton
[00:09:39] <monr0e> Ok sanity check. Am I being stupid here, or is it an awful idea to disable UFW on this mailserver? Some blokey in the thread I'm linking below says yes
[00:09:42] <monr0e> er
[00:09:46] <monr0e> says no, rather
[00:09:47] <monr0e> https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/issues/2792
[00:10:14] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> anybody know how to make a unifi AP consume it's max power?
[00:10:21] <vinrock> "Best practice: don't use a firewall."
[00:10:25] <vinrock> thanks now im a litle dumber for reading that
[00:10:27] <koollman> monr0e: it's not as awful as it seems. The real awful part is to run a mailsystem in docker, really :)
[00:10:33] <MarsSpiral> allow all to all - firewall issues resolved :))
[00:10:52] <MarsSpiral> ./s 
[00:10:53] <koollman> but otherwise, yeah, in general, docker and firewall mgmt systems don't mix well, so pick one or the other. or pick both, and expect pain
[00:10:54] <monr0e> koollman why so? Apart from docker being a pain in the fucking backside and all that
[00:10:59] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> I've got a POE+ wifi6 AP on monoprice slimeline wire and I want to make sure it's OK before I fully deploy it
[00:11:05] <monr0e> hm
[00:11:13] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> right now i've got it in a coil for the past 5hrs
[00:11:17] <koollman> monr0e: because docker networking will mess with firewall rules. It insert its own rules
[00:11:20] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> and the coil isn't even warm
[00:12:04] <monr0e> Thing is, I also run a little webserver on this machine. The idea of disabling the firewall makes me uneasy
[00:12:04] <koollman> monr0e: and either ufw rules will protect 'too much' for docker stuff to work. Or the docker rules will just be holes in the firewall anyway
[00:12:32] <koollman> monr0e: then think about why you're doing this, then. And have a look at what docker inserts in your firewall, then :)
[00:13:15] <monr0e> It's really just a testbed for me to teach myself about administering my own stack, because that's what I'll be doing once I start with my business in earnest
[00:13:40] <monr0e> v. poor and cannot hire a greybeard :(
[00:14:16] <koollman> my personal opinion would be to isolate mailcow in its own vm. It's not really made to share a system with other things and its usage of docker is unusual
[00:14:26] <vinrock> Telgareith, do you have a dc power supply
[00:14:34] <vinrock> just send 12v over the line to any random device
[00:14:48] <vinrock> crank it up to the ap's max draw
[00:14:49] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> POE+ is 48V
[00:15:05] <vinrock> ok so send 48v
[00:15:12] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> and it's not just on two pairs

[00:29:15] <Cl0udNinja> AnonymooseReddtr, 1 full time working should be able to

[00:29:35] <Cl0udNinja> that doesnt mean you're above flipping burgers if you dont have other skills
[00:29:39] <AnonymooseReddtr> oh hell no
[00:29:44] <AnonymooseReddtr> didn't say that 
[00:29:56] <AnonymooseReddtr> I just think that minimum wage workers get shit on 
[00:30:02] <AnonymooseReddtr> they shouldn't have to work multiple jobs just to make ends meet
[00:30:28] <rpifan> exactly
[00:30:31] <rpifan> i think UBI
[00:30:34] <rpifan> is the only way forward
[00:30:43] <rpifan> that way you can tell that asshole boss to fuck off
[00:30:46] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol
[00:30:54] <AnonymooseReddtr> eh i love my boss and my job
[00:31:00] <AnonymooseReddtr> then again i'm not making min wage either
[00:31:42] <rpifan> still a boss is a boss
[00:31:47] <vinrock> bossman here has bought me so much beer this past year i kinda feel like i need to do something nice for him this year

[08:12:13] <cryptic1> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, SJDVD. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE system made useful by the SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
[08:12:13] <cryptic1> Many computer users run a modified version of the SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE system, developed by the SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, 
[08:12:13] <cryptic1> but it is just a part of the system they use.
[08:12:15] <cryptic1> Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the Log Forge operating system: the whole system is basically SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE with Linux added, or SPACE JAM DEE VE
[08:12:20] <cryptic1> E DEE/Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE/Linux

[15:38:32] <monr0e> but frankly we don't have that much need for it, our non-renewable production is considerably lower than it was ten years ago
[15:38:55] <Kiernian> That one still fucking slays me. Your country has SO MANY ELECTRIC TEA KETTLES that it needs to BUY electricty from other countries JUST for television commercial breaks.
[15:39:01] <monr0e> lmaoo
[15:39:03] <monr0e> ikr
[15:39:11] <sd> 13<C​olour> Hahaaa
[15:39:42] <monr0e> its because we run at 240v on 15amp home circuits. Kettles have the ability to pull that much amperage that the grid literally suffers as a result
[15:39:54] <koollman> well, either that, or it would need efficient storage (with quick reactivity) for peak kettle demand :)
[15:40:55] <monr0e> there was a time int eh 90's when more suburban areas would frequently need line replacements because the cable literally destroyed itself with the heat generation
[15:41:34] <Kiernian> yeah, our basic outlets are 110v on whatever circuit. 20amp at the most for residential IIRC. Nothing hits 220v until you get to an electric clothes drier for laundry
[15:42:07] <koollman> I wonder what would be an efficient way to deal with it. Maybe something like flywheel ups. can ramp up stored energy slowly, and release it quickly
[15:42:21] <monr0e> Yep. And our 240v is single phase (afaik). 15amps over 240v is a hell of a lot
[15:42:36] <monr0e> Flywheels are how traditional turbine and coal plants work
[15:43:19] <Kiernian> which is, incidentally, a large part of why electric kettles never took off over here. They suck. It also makes it hilarious to see british reactions when people boil a mug of water in a microwave and drop a teabag in that.
[15:43:22] <monr0e> Problem is you can only put so much load on it. You're asking a hell of a lot during kettle time
[15:43:23] <koollman> and every city should have flywheels for peak kettle time, to offset the peak and avoid buying more power elsewhere ;)

[15:45:46] <monr0e> Its not the risk of burning yourself, its the steam. It will eventually damage the microwave.
[15:46:04] <koollman> it shouldn't. Or it's a crap microwave

[15:46:40] <monr0e> It shoulden't, yeah, but boiling water (as opposed to boiling food with water IN it) allows for a great deal more free-flowing steam

[15:53:25] <monr0e> I should probably update that too, but it still has some life left in it I think
[15:53:46] <sd> 13<C​olour> My American online friends get confused as to why UK needs kettles when they just use microwaves.
[15:53:50] <monr0e> I'm also not sure I'm ready to manage an in-situ upgrade
[15:54:04] <sd> 13<C​olour> I guess UK has the advantage in that you can just tap the kettle and run off and do something else for 5 minutes.
[15:54:09] <koollman> well, you can either update to 20.04, or wait for 22.04 which is not too far now
[15:54:11] <monr0e> Not even five minutes
[15:54:24] <sd> 13<C​olour> I dunno if microwaves in USA will just boil water and you can just run off and leave it until it's done.
[15:54:29] <sd> 13<C​olour> Babysitting water sounds annoying
[15:54:58] <monr0e> koollman: yeah sure, I'm more just concerned about not really knowing enough about ubuntu to manage it if it goes horrendously wrong. I'd ideally like to upgrade it rahter than reinstall it
[15:55:02] <Kiernian> I mean, if you learn how long it takes your particular microwave to boil x ounces of water when you put it in a particular mug in the center, then yeah, you can just set it and walk off
[15:55:49] <sd> 13<C​olour> Do American kettlewaves come with little cups that say "This amount is 60 seconds on full power"
[15:55:55] <sd> 13<C​olour> That's the only thing I can think of
[15:55:56] <Kiernian> or fancier microwaves have plug-in temperature probes. I've owned a few of those. cool stuff, set temperature, hit button, it stops itself
[15:56:02] <monr0e> If you put the water you need in the kettle, which for me is obviously a single cup, you have enough time to fill the kettle, then wash your cup and fetch a teabag. Then the kettle is done and you have hot water ready
[15:56:18] <sd> 13<C​olour> Ah if you put more water in it'll take longer of course
[15:56:27] <monr0e> literally 30 seconds
[15:56:27] <sd> 13<C​olour> That's probably why I'm like yeah 5 minutes
[15:56:31] <koollman> monr0e: plan for reinstall, and try the in-place upgrade. have backups. 'do-release-upgrade' works decently
[15:57:31] <sd> 13<B​lasteh> I upgraded my 16.04 to 20.04 with no probs
[15:57:34] <monr0e> I'm probably going to play around wiht it a little more tbh. I still need to figure out a properly automated backup system, rn I just backup individual files when I change them.

[15:57:52] <koollman> monr0e: oh. fix that first :)
[15:58:19] <monr0e> Yep. Plus mailcow&docker is going to be a pain, I know it
[15:58:22] <koollman> at least rsync to some other disk, with snapshot. that would still be better than making sure you don't forget about a file
[15:58:36] <monr0e> I ... I need another disk
[15:58:49] <monr0e> This is an elderly inspiron laptop
[15:58:54] <koollman> or just use borg, or restic, or some other tool that has reasonable defaults
[15:59:12] <koollman> well, you need another place for your data to call it a backup, automated or not
[16:01:13] <monr0e> Ideally I need a nas. I'm debating just getting another cheap elderly laptop and some drive cages for now. Those cdrom-to-sata adaptors are still easy enough to find. 
[16:01:18] <monr0e> budget homelab ftw
[16:02:42] <xe0n> that will run like junk
[16:02:43] <xe0n> lol
[16:02:53] <koollman> well, it is junk, so that is ok :)
[16:02:58] <monr0e> As does my mailserver, but its honestly fine
[16:03:11] <koollman> depending on how old the old laptop is, if you have usb3 on it ... it's a decent cheap way to attach storage
[16:03:11] <monr0e> actually tbh I don't notice a problem when I don't limit the bandwidth
[16:03:18] <koollman> (at that budget level, at least)
[16:04:07] <monr0e> koollman: I was planning on getting a mid-00's machine and an adaptor for the CDRom drive, so I can hook up a decent 2tb sata drive
[16:04:21] <monr0e> *CDRom slot
[16:04:33] <koollman> ok,that's really old :)
[16:04:46] <monr0e> The current mailserver is from 2001

[16:28:49] <Kiernian> interestingly, that's because orange peels have changed in the last 40 years. They've been breeding them to be easier to peel, kinda like how they breed seedless grapes

[19:09:03] <arlion> oh dam. I'll watch a youtube video on how to do it
[19:09:09] <mistiry> learn how the mechanic works 
[19:09:44] <arlion> yeah, as a new player im finding messing around in god mode is the best way to learn the game
[19:09:46] <mistiry> it will blow your mind how fucking cool it is to kick off a massive project and have literally thousands of bots doing the work for you
[19:09:57] <arlion> oh that just sounds better than sex
[19:10:16] <mistiry> it is fabulous
[19:10:26] <mistiry> now i want to play again LOL
[19:10:34] <mistiry> and we just did a playthrough a few weeks back
[19:11:17] <mistiry> arlion:  https://factoriobin.com/post/Y52EhJ74
[19:11:24] <mistiry> thats the blueprint book
[19:11:42] <arlion> nooo. this looks liek cheating
[19:11:55] <mistiry> not at all. 
[19:12:10] <mistiry> blueprints are designed to be shared and used by others
[19:12:44] <mistiry> nilhaus's specifically are very very good. because he works out the actual math and stuff in his designs to make them the most efficient
[19:12:45] <vinrock> this game looks rad
[19:12:58] <mistiry> even using his blueprints, you will want/need to make plenty of your own
[19:13:05] <mistiry> or modifications to his to fit your need
[19:13:18] <mistiry> vinrock: it is amazing
[19:13:55] <mistiry> wait til you learn about using a main bus line to feed your items
[19:14:00] <fritzwastaken> lol
[19:14:06] <mistiry> omg i could sit here shilling for this game all day
[19:14:13] <fritzwastaken> Looks like I put a factorio fire under mistiry's butt
[19:14:14] <arlion> mistiry: i just built my first main bus 
[19:14:31] <fritzwastaken> gunna start a new playthrough?
[19:14:38] <mistiry> fritzwastaken: all it takes is seeing someone new is playing, and i get excited again
[19:14:42] <mistiry> DrGibby probably does too
[19:14:56] <lancehead> I get that with DayZ lol, I know the feeling 
[19:15:01] <mistiry> meh, idk. i really enjoy it multiplayer so would need a group of folks that want to play thru it
[19:16:06] <mistiry> arlion: the phrase for factorio is "The Factory Must Grow". if you havent learned why yet, you will :D
[19:16:23] <arlion> yeah, ive gotten myself jammed many times
[19:16:43] <arlion> currently i have 3 different trains.. and then i look at some other designs and my jaw just drops.
[19:16:54] <arlion> there are some brilliant mfs out there.
[19:17:05] <mistiry> it becomes much easier with bots, but you will find yourself eventually just completely ripping out entire factories to replace with something new. or re-running lines for seemingly miles because you need room.

[19:17:29] <arlion> i just want to keep playing to just get to that level
[19:18:27] <mistiry> trains are a bit of a beast to design well. a well designed system has basically a main bus for the trains, so they share the main thoroughfare, but then split off to the stations they need

[23:30:35] <Disconnect> Strangely enough, they were decent.
[23:30:44] <signofzeta> "Zoom in on her bush, I think I see compression artifacts"
[23:30:51] <Disconnect> Nothing in depth but not bad for a quick daily update
[23:31:05] <Disconnect> Nah for that we had the masters. Those were full uncompressed monster beasts.
[23:31:43] <vinrock> its gonnna be depressing if i watch naked news later n and its more balanced and informative than anything else out there
[23:32:11] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> wait, thats a thing still
[23:32:44] <Disconnect> Nah. They're Canadian, plenty of relatively balanced news comes that way. Especially when you don't look for deep investigations, just news updates.
