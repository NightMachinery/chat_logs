[01:33:41] <zleap> find out what they use their computer for first
[01:33:59] <bandali> yeah what zleap said. switching from MS's nonfree Office programs to LibreOffice, even when still on Windows, would be a good first step towards freedom
[01:34:04] <zleap> make sure there are free tools they can use as drop in replacement
[01:35:18] <bandali> i would try to explain the current sad situation with chips/drivers, especially wifi since that's one of the first things people notice
[01:35:22] <tesseract> suggesting and persuading to use Ubuntu is also a good step
[01:36:05] <bandali> i would perhaps say something like: if you can get a (reasonably priced) wifi dongle which works with free software, you may be able to start using wholly free distros right away :)
[01:36:23] <tesseract> bandali: no newbie would buy WiFi dongle for that
[01:36:39] <zleap> don't forget if you suggest some distro with a low user base you need to provide support more, if you suggest Ubuntu / Mint then there is more support,  just set them up with IRC too perhaps, teach how to use, and how to ask for help
[01:36:42] <bandali> tesseract, that as an absolute generalization can't hold true. i would. and i know many would
[01:37:08] <isf> if you do good your work, and say to them what is nonfree software, they go to know why is better buy a long cable ethernet or a dongle for connect to internet without running nonfree software :)
[01:37:17] <tesseract> zleap: yeah
[01:38:05] <zleap> only at our local lubrary the either net ports are locked down or disconnected we can't just plug in a cable
[01:38:12] <bandali> but yeah as zleap said i think it's very important to be able to talk to someone and/or see and learn what free software replacements are available for the nonfree software one is currently using, and work towards gradually eliminating the nonfree ones in favour of the free ones

[07:48:59] <Ribby> Well, I missed out on the nbsd argument. Yes, there are definitely older OS b/c it's UNIX. Of course! There was no intention to state that GNU is the Adam (the first brand/derivative) of the UNIX family. That would been a ridiculous statement regarding the matter of development.
[07:54:25] <Ribby> I don't want to be a naysayer, it's just there's an incentive for bsd to be marketed as some sort of marketing ploy for berkeley itself. It's nice and all, with all the historical privileges and all these things. There's definitely a script and motives to askew claims of bias.

[09:33:07] <epony> there are no licenses, there are no patents, and all software is free and equal

[09:45:22] <epony> the rest of the world does not believe in unionisation of uncaptured work labourers, you really can not make any justification why software should have any licensing at all
[09:45:32] <bugweiser> first average joe gets his idea stolen and someone else gets rich beyond dreams.. why? couse average joe couldn't muster the cash to protect his idea.
[09:45:35] <epony> outside of the USA, this model is totally irrelevant
[09:45:58] <bugweiser> then mordred stepped in and said basically.. "one law for you and another for the rest of us...?"
[09:46:42] <bugweiser> so, yeah, we must then follow the law to the letter, as black and white as possible, after all if no-one likes the outcome of the law, perhaps we should fix the law itself (and not the outcome).
[09:46:46] <epony> corrupt legal system that services big money..

But I don't want a gnu virus and more importantly I spend weeks shaving off characters in code... really think I want to add a proze the size of gnu. I'd rather toss in the towel a that point.

[10:13:57] <labrador> nope

[10:14:16] <labrador> But severely reduced
[10:14:21] <labrador> Their original intention

[10:14:36] <epony> labrador, this is where you disagree with real free software then
[10:14:42] <labrador> Maybe a 20 year term for movies,10 for books,5 for software
[10:14:45] <labrador> thats enough
[10:14:58] <epony> see, I don't mention mobies books and music at all
[10:15:00] <labrador> After that its public domain

[10:18:12] <epony> then why would all of a sudden some "republisher" claim HE OWNS IT instead?
[10:18:29] <epony> it was not THE PUBLISHER who created it

[10:18:49] <epony> it were people like joe, jane and *others*
[10:19:34] <epony> so is not a belonging to a copyring HOLDER
[10:19:50] <epony> thus copyright law does not apply to free software
[10:19:56] <epony> that's the real point
[10:20:21] <bugweiser> I think we need sane jackals instead.
[10:20:23] <epony> and the fact that this is happening in a highly financialised late capitalism system does not change anything
[10:21:16] <epony> cause if this software can not be freed from the hands of the copyright HOLDER, then some other people will create it WITHOUT that holder's involvement whatsoever
[10:21:36] <bugweiser> remember bit-map fonts? The good guys had the best jackhal, he managed to explain to the judge that what was on the legal table was impossible and unrealisticly. "here judge, here you have 8*16 px, square, here is a imaginary base-line, draw up all the capital case letter A possibilitys.
[10:21:52] <epony> thus, it creates DUPLICATE effort which is hugely economically unfavourable
[10:22:00] <bugweiser> needless to say, at the end of that law-suit (in usa), vendors IMMEDIATELY went for ttf etc..)
[10:22:05] <epony> and reduces all chances of standardisation
[10:22:17] <bugweiser> standardisaton.. pahz-iks
[10:22:21] <bugweiser> muwahahahaha
[10:22:23] <epony> so you have incompatible computer software, and thus COMMERCE HAS WON again
[10:22:49] <epony> because the copyright law is the tooling of COMMERCE
[10:23:06] <epony> not the tooling of free and open public for the public
[10:23:23] <bugweiser> so then gnu was so great ??  Take shar-utils, has uuencode/decode.  Think mr Korb ever between version 4.12 and 4.13.4  TEST like ONE TIME if uudecode could decode what his uuencode just wrote ??
[10:23:24] <bugweiser> nope
[10:23:28] <bugweiser> not in the slightest
[10:23:28] <epony> so, tell me, labrador, why are you defending copyright law so much?
[10:23:40] <bugweiser> lets not start about MaNgleD tar-files
[10:23:41] <labrador> becuz its needed
[10:23:52] <epony> well, it isn't ;-)
[10:24:01] <labrador> otherwise noone would make movis
[10:24:03] <epony> not everything is USA copyright law
[10:24:14] <epony> we do not care about movies made in teh USA though
[10:24:17] <epony> we have our own
[10:24:34] <bugweiser> cough, USA copyright law, is USA's take on berne-convention !!!
[10:24:35] <klys> what's a book on illustrations by a game publisher and why shouldn't it be copy
[10:25:02] <epony> books and movies and music.. are not software
[10:25:05] <bugweiser> and I can snip you a quote of a judge clearly pointing to congress, spelling out: no-one wants me to decide this, but this is what the law says.
[10:25:25] <epony> what applies to them as law, is not in my interest ;-) that is print and media distribution
[10:25:34] <klys> software shares qualities with legal forms
[10:25:39] <epony> software travels outside the control of media distributors
[10:25:52] <epony> it is between the people as folklore
[10:26:00] <epony> ask Stallman to explain this to you
[10:26:17] <epony> you do NOT own folklore with copyright law
[10:26:22] <bugweiser> internet didnt exist when berne was written.
[10:26:30] <bugweiser> hence 'simultanious publication'
[10:26:38] <epony> yeah, it does not apply to folklore
[10:26:40] <bugweiser> which is exactly the law-case I was referring to.
[10:26:46] <klys> legal forms exist by virtue of software, and the relationship between this and that goes with the grain.
[10:27:42] <epony> what grain? bits are digits, non-tangible information recipes
[10:27:47] <klys> source code.
[10:27:48] <bugweiser> the case where strict interpretation of the law (as adopted by us congress) made it correct for usa to appropriate itself 'country of origin', and subsequently let it's local laws apply to (contrary to what one might THINK that berne said/intended).
[10:27:56] <epony> your computing is a product, of electric energy conversion
[10:28:05] <epony> the recipe is common human knowledge
[10:28:24] <bugweiser> and thus, since it was usa as country of origin (not austraia, or denmark), the copyright holder should have still registered his copyright before filing the claim.
[10:28:29] <bugweiser> claim denied.
[10:28:29] <epony> who cares about YOUR source code, when everyone has their OWN source code
[10:28:37] <klys> then what about all the utilities you're using to enact that "common knowledge?"
[10:28:43] <epony> there is no copyright on folklore
[10:29:00] <bugweiser> ironically, everyone is angry about that decision...
[10:29:10] <epony> you buy your own computer, that's a musical instrument
[10:29:15] <bugweiser> instead of 'haha, your game imploded'
[10:29:29] <epony> you write your own notes and play your own music and collaborate with others and exchange between yourself
[10:29:41] <epony> there is no PUBLISHER for that
[10:29:49] <klys> and how many legal forms did it take to sign for that computer?
[10:30:04] <bugweiser> who cares about publisher, you just wrote the magic words: I wrote it.
[10:30:06] <epony> klys, are you coming from outer space ;-)
[10:30:08] <bugweiser> done
[10:30:14] <bugweiser> automatically copyright me
[10:30:17] *** Joins: freep (~freepppp@46.246.189.172.dsl.dyn.forthnet.gr)
[10:30:19] <bugweiser> and the idea is good.
[10:30:21] <bugweiser> it is abused
[10:30:24] <klys> and how many laws were enacted just so you could have the framework applied to the computer in your face.
[10:30:25] <bugweiser> (due to mordred)
[10:31:04] <klys> and what business models and paradigms resulted
[10:31:08] <epony> so invisithreat is created, and then everyone has to pay for using someone's claim he owns something which is just common shared folklore
[10:31:20] <klys> and you can't just say here that those aren't historic paradigms
[10:31:21] <epony> folklore is free
[10:31:34] <epony> free software does not need copyright
[10:31:41] <klys> copy does
[10:31:45] <epony> nope
[10:32:03] <klys> square one: what's a book on illustrations by a game publisher and why shouldn't it be copy
[10:32:09] <epony> the more copies you make cheaply (by own handwriting) the more versions you have
[10:32:20] <epony> IT"S NOT ABOUT BOOKS THOUGH IS IT?
[10:32:44] <klys> how many books are sitting open on desks just to build your machine?
[10:32:49] <bugweiser> epony, that is kinda what i started with... (when I showed my cards after you shown yours, so to say).  
[10:33:02] * epony declares klys confused between tangible and untangible concepts
[10:33:20] <bugweiser> lets hurry with a legal way *world wide* to give something, couse at this moment, there isn't even *that* option.
[10:33:21] <klys> epony, there is a relationship between law and sources
[10:33:38] <klys> it is not a revocable thing in society
[10:33:53] <epony> nah, it's in your imagination because you've grown up in a system of commerce for profit
[10:34:22] <epony> you have no idea what government programmes is for free works that belong to all people of the nation
[10:34:50] <epony> and you have no idea what nominal cost is (subsidised by the tax money of the people who benefit from it)
[10:35:09] <klys> nominal = in name, like branding
[10:35:11] <epony> you believe in "sales" and law that makes sales to sell services and dependencies
[10:35:26] <bugweiser> then good news, epony, there are numerous voices pretty high up, in usa, arguing that *at least* university knowledge was payed for by society, and therefor should benefit society freely!
[10:36:04] <epony> so you're technically defending copyright law because you think that for-profit is fair for folklore ;-)
[10:36:21] <klys> I am not equating law with sources
[10:36:35] <klys> I am saying the relationship is tight
[10:36:46] <epony> while I say it's not, and copyright law is completely irrelevant to free software that is as free as any other human knowledge shared between all people
[10:37:24] <epony> bugweiser, that is similar for products of government agencies too
[10:37:42] <bugweiser> the ideas were not bad, and no-one could come up with internet back then (almost a century ago is what we talk about, don't forget, even if usa was as late as 1989 to join...  NOTE, that makes pretty much all BBS CONTENT LEGALLY FREEE, ALWAYS WAS)
[10:37:49] <epony> like NASA for example releases its "public" version of its findings
[10:38:29] <epony> technically, copyright is a much older than a century ago
[10:38:43] <epony> and is about publishers rights

[10:39:06] <klys> and I think you are equating applications with sources.
[10:39:15] <epony> while free software is unregulated copies at will
[10:39:30] <bugweiser> epony, yes, older, techinically, but not the thing you fundamentally (actually I myself as well mostly) argue about.
[10:39:50] <bugweiser> we argue about the idea that something is copyright YOU the moment you create it, no formalities required!
[10:39:57] <epony> bugweiser, technically I don't argue, just saying what others believe too ;-)
[10:39:59] <bugweiser> and back then there was a genuine problem even with that.
[10:40:37] <epony> if you plan to sell it, do whatever you like with regards to laws and such "ownership claims"
[10:41:11] <epony> but if you plan to release it free as a gift for everyone to copy at their own expenses, you just have no copyrights with the first copy, it's public

[10:44:05] <bugweiser> in that regard, i've had numerous could showers when looking at gnu file formats over the decades. 
[10:44:57] <epony> well, people as individuals giving away their "gift" to a publisher is "proprietisation"
[10:45:12] <bugweiser> labrador: fact: more than one judge inernationally can not decide what kind of document the gpl actuall IS
[10:45:33] <bugweiser> (top of my mind, a state in usa, and france. Prolly also germany)
[10:45:56] <epony> so, how can you convince people that a publisher is needed, when their gift was already free and does not need legal protection to be free
[10:46:21] <epony> you do not need a police officer to stand in front of you telling everyone you're a free man?
[10:46:23] <bugweiser> it really starts with a good idea, protecting the authors.

[11:14:27] <bugweiser> That dream of a common foe.. that is shattered for me personally.
[11:15:06] <epony> actually many countries routed excess vaccines to lower output economies, that thing is happening

[11:15:46] <epony> maybe the western countries were greedy as with the copyright law

[11:21:47] <klys> you can either live off welfare or hold your own as a consumer

[11:22:55] <epony> labrador, are you sure?
[11:23:18] <epony> klys, what is a real consumer?
[11:23:26] <klys> someone who owns a car
[11:23:47] <epony> is the car a digital information unit or not?
[11:24:04] <bugweiser> lets not go there :)
[11:24:07] <klys> it has motors and access to highways
[11:24:52] <klys> if you ask me, it includes both yes and no
[11:25:10] <klys> because it's chock full of microcontrollers
[11:25:20] <epony> chock is not an English word
[11:25:41] <epony> you know where it comes from?
[11:25:46] <klys> no
[11:25:47] <epony> (Arab languages)
[11:26:06] <epony> "superlative"
[11:26:37] <bugweiser> oxford and webster both accept it and define it.
[11:27:27] <epony> so the car is a material product that has transportation purpose
[11:27:35] <klys> yes, largely
[11:28:01] <bugweiser> 10 years ago, now or 10 years in the future?
[11:28:06] <klys> now
[11:28:21] <bugweiser> then no, more than transportation purpose
[11:28:32] <bugweiser> I'd like it to have just that purpose...
[11:28:33] <klys> also ten years ago, yeah
[11:28:57] <bugweiser> klys, yeah, hell like onstar was much sooner in usa, granted!
[11:29:25] <klys> you mean the gps navigation system?
[11:29:37] <epony> the software however is not a material product, it is a recipe of making any generic computer "perform some information processing" which is a built-in function of the computer
[11:30:05] <epony> so the software is you knowing where to drive to, knowledge or informational recipe
[11:30:30] <bugweiser> i mean that thing that also automatically calls the cops and an ambulance if you had a crash, that thing where the cops just turn off your car in a persuit, that thing that is (gonna?) track if you get tired 
[11:30:36] <epony> with the difference that, the result stays in the non-tangible reality of information only
[11:30:42] <loganlee[gnu]> hi guys

[11:31:24] <epony> that's why analogies with a car do not work ;-) not comparable
[11:31:54] <epony> and me telling you earlier that you can't differentiate between these categories
[11:32:06] <bugweiser> and from the government and manufacturer (and their commercial associates) this is obviously intentional. Therefor, no in the grand scheme of things, a car is much more than just a transportation device.
[11:32:15] <klys> cars are technology and engineering
[11:32:45] <epony> however computers operate without drivers
[11:33:00] <klys> not a legal codex, though there is a significantly greater set of legal influence when it comes to pedalling a car than your computer.

[11:35:13] <epony> everything that it can do has already been produced in teh machine and you have paid for it in full, you own the machine as an object
[11:35:23] <labrador> nope
[11:35:28] <labrador> code takes money to write
[11:35:42] <bugweiser> and documentation
[11:35:42] <labrador> its a scarce resource
[11:35:49] <epony> labrador, you think it's air you're breathing?
[11:35:52] <labrador> you need to pay money to get access to code
[11:35:55] <labrador> and docs
[11:35:59] <labrador> as bugweiser said
[11:36:06] <klys> some folks want access to everything and there are folks like you who create their carreer trying to tell them they can have access for nothing.  free access.  well copyright is the middle ground, unless someone can reenvision the middle ground to make it compatible with each participant.
[11:37:05] <epony> technically, nobody needs copyright to start their own machine and perform their own recipe of their own doings like blinking and making humming noises and producing some calculations
[11:37:50] <klys> right, iow. nobody needs a guarantee, that is, nobody but the inspection office.
[11:38:13] <epony> you see, you don't need to pay anything, someone lends you a couple of recipes and you're good to go, or you invent your own
[11:39:00] <epony> it's really easy, cause people have decided that they can exchange recipes and collect these and give it to each other for free
[11:39:02] <bugweiser> interesting example, 'copyright to start ..' (thinking of ibm, whom had 'related' thoughts :) and some other folk called Phoenix

[11:47:00] <epony> think again, do you need copyright law or not?
[11:47:18] <klys> you or the inspection?
[11:47:51] <bugweiser> And billy had his childhood (and therefor initial moral compass in the land of oppurtunity) in a particular era, and his teen-age days in the subsequent different era, and his golden contribution yeaars equally in a subsequent different era. And unlike the person that will go down in history books as his biggest competitor, billy actaully did help us forward in a lot of ways, both in etching in defacto standards EVEN WITH IBM  (this famous ramquote
[11:47:51] <bugweiser>  is misconstrued from that particular fact)) AND actively did write code..
[11:48:41] <bugweiser> and.. lets face it... for the masses.. he got it right.
[11:48:48] <bugweiser> and we can claim he stole everything..
[11:48:54] <epony> actually, people do not know who William H. Gates is, if they are not forced to use anything of that reseller company.
[11:49:17] <bugweiser> but somehow that goes also against the vein of the current discussion, otherwise he just picked good 'recepies' and made a good 'brew'.
[11:49:43] <epony> and they still don't know to this day, that what he wrote were some advocacy letters and a couple of recipes they did not need
[11:50:53] <epony> so, no.. Billie the kid is not a facilitator of computing, it's a trade vendor / reseller of other people's recipes, a publisher, a copyright law beneficient, an appointed to fulfill government orders nobody like you
[11:51:52] <klys> according to that line of thinking, proprietry solutions are coded in law and not fact.
[11:51:53] <epony> so the disparity is, you do not get appointed, and not because you're not tallented, but because you're not a reseller and not of that family
[11:52:18] <bugweiser> he had good ideas (in picking the good parts), was at the right moment on the right place. The rest is arguably just average joe's fault (whom took his cash to an invester that in turn invested (and thus squeezed) whatver company they invest in).
[11:52:37] <bugweiser> at some point you have employees, with kids, whom you know (in the start up)
[11:52:45] <klys> also it does not respect law, because it renames the subject in an attempt to mock law as it stands, which is real.

[12:01:58] <epony> so that software which is folklore and which is from the people for the people, has to be excluded from laws that capitalise on its distribution, since it costs nothing to the folklore people
[12:02:43] <klys> science and math is separated from law and management.  sci <-> engr <-> mgmt
[12:03:05] <klys> technology is coupled with engineering.

[12:04:01] <epony> I said my parts.. you can dance a bit too you know, that's how folklore happens
[12:04:12] <bugweiser> I know programmers, and their families, whom eat from that particualr programmer's work (which they licence usage rights to customers).
[12:04:24] <klys> those are just how the schools are set up at the university level
[12:05:04] <bugweiser> some of it is kind of essential software even.. And it would not exist without the programmer getting an income out of it and working on it most of the time.

[12:05:53] <epony> that's what you're missing, essential software gets created out of necessity, and on state orders and initial government procurement one way or another
[12:07:04] <bugweiser> then it would be of the 'quality' where version 4.12 to 4.13.4 (with a bunch of publically announced 'real releases'  wouldn't have EVEN bothered to see if your decoder could actually read what your encoder wrote.

[12:12:38] <epony> that's not how subjects in school are named ;-)
[12:12:46] <loganlee[gnu]> my two cents is just as tertiary education should be free, software should be free too.
[12:12:57] <klys> the former is the school outline

[12:16:45] <epony> these someones are amateurs giving their work in favour of their folklore projects and to the entire human population as gratis and free and open gifts since digital recipes for computers are easy to copy at nearly no cost other than what the person already paid to get the machine and networking going on
[12:17:04] <epony> so you turn on the "computer" and you can share recipes too

[12:32:32] <bugweiser> you can, to some extent..
[12:32:49] <bugweiser> but there is for starters a clear difference in quality, both in result as in documentation.

[12:34:24] <epony> so this is the real issue, your state system does not provide for the people from the people with the objectives and priorities of the people
[12:34:34] <bugweiser> yes, and i've seen close to 2 decades very very nice BUT SMALL softwares (in my case on win).
[12:34:44] <bugweiser> emphasis on: but small
[12:35:05] <klys> so why not just get the main project, like msys2 or cygwin
[12:35:11] <bugweiser> anything more elaborate, wasn't free, or was never finished/maintained.
[12:35:21] <epony> it provides a model of commerce and trade, for the publishers and for the proprietors, so you have no really viable chances of free and open amateur and folklore produce without being forced the same economic and trade constraints (shackles)

[12:37:27] <epony> at any rate, free software is inevitable, it happens with and without state orders, so the commercial governments make sure there is an advantage of commerce and profit models of resale and trade
[12:37:58] <loganlee[gnu]> bugweiser: windows subsystem for linux
[12:38:02] <epony> that's the copyright and patent law, a 25-30 year disparity between the commerce and the folklore

[12:38:48] <bugweiser> I think it's an interesting call to pick up that kernel.
[12:38:51] <epony> WSL should be named MS Linux compat layer
[12:39:40] <epony> it's useless, since it creates an artificial subversion of Linux with a WIN/DOS midlayer
[12:39:50] <loganlee[gnu]> epony: it's not something bill gates would approve

[12:39:57] <loganlee[gnu]> epony: i mean the wsl
[12:40:04] <bugweiser> actually neither.. couse both elude to a different kernel.. (and making linux into a fashionable word).

[12:40:45] <bugweiser> MS *nix compat layer
[12:40:55] <epony> we can decide on our own, individually and as a group providing each other suggestions etc
[12:41:22] <epony> yeah, it's a series of fails with SFU and others
[12:42:46] <bugweiser> loganlee[gnu]: there was a point in time (arguably twice) where ms could have easily pushed apple over the cliff
[12:42:49] <bugweiser> but didn't
[12:43:11] <epony> so, people who have the option to install a free system, do not need an underlayer of MSFT banana peel to break their neck
[12:43:20] <bugweiser> they were'nt a competitor really in OS, but did hold sufficiently significant users of MS Office products..
[12:43:40] <bugweiser> and for that reason it helped apple to stay afloat (at *least* once).
[12:43:57] <epony> labrador, that's the same argument why you do NOT need Java midlayer to run your programs between your applications and your operating system
[12:44:45] <epony> (which was a brief Java critique in the other channel a short few minutes ago)

[14:23:38] <bugweiser> I don't really know of the top of my head what they are.. I never commited (lol pun intended) privately to a soft version controll. at parttime work I'm blessed (and have some colleagues) that put our work in the 'right' place (also couse there it often does depend on the customer). Most gits have a browser interface which is usually sufficient for me.
[14:27:37] <bugweiser> 'privately' (and when I had my own customers) the 'figure out some svn' just remained on the todo-list while more pressing work was done. And i'd find it scary to figure out how to get 'everything' back if something would bork.  Project directories with a date-based versioning scheme in file-name always felt more practical (specially if unexpeced stuff should happen).

[21:45:36] <bugweiser> rindolf, while at that subject.. is there any svn package I should know about? I don't want to be tied to an ide. I'd like to retain project-folders with versioned files (latest has no version). The only thing I miss is an overview, and a diff. I'm 'torn' about 'commit messages'... perhaps something that trivially combines it with changelog ?
[21:46:07] <labrador> bugweiser, was there any problem with git?
[21:47:33] <bugweiser> well, over time you see loads of comments/questions and (self-inflicted) problems come by. That was surely kinda intimidating. As i said, I do like the 'assurance' of flat files on a file-system, and learning that takes just 1 minute.
[21:47:40] <rindolf> bugweiser: i use the CLI tools mostly

[22:22:26] <bugweiser> my prime lang is js. While I can parse most of C (i's highly similar especially when just number-crunching) I wouldn't entrust over 2 decades of my stuff to my on C-interfaces :)
[22:25:58] <rindolf> bugweiser: are u for real? there are js / python3 / java / whatever wrappers
[22:26:10] <bugweiser> something simple, pretty much stand-alone that can take a project folder and index + diff it (would be really nice if it could keep track of what functions/variables are defined where, but then it would need to read flawless js, so I guess it needs esprima built-in or similar), and produce (potentially on the fly) corresponding html-files would be sufficient. I guess it should mostly feature 2 commands, one to (re)build backing-data from scratch, a
[22:26:10] <bugweiser> nd one to pickup from a known state (wich prolly isn't that hard if it keeps a file with hashes of all files in the project folder since the last time it ran)
[22:28:22] <bugweiser> yeah, I never got round to it, and i'd want something simple. Regarding C, I assumed you intended to hint that I might customize svn to my liking by talking to some api over C. If I mis-interpreted, i'm sorry.
