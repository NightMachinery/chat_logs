[15:40:27] <sebag> Hi. Is there a way for gsed -i to not touch files which yield no substitution/change after execution of -e commands? It currently seems to write (change mtime) for each file regardless of this...
[15:42:03] <emanuele6> no, use ex(1) instead of sed and save with x instead of wq
[15:43:41] <emanuele6> sed -i 's/a/b/g' file   ->   ex -sc '%s/a/b/g|x' file
[15:44:32] *** Joins: tech_exorcist (txrcst@user/tech-exorcist/x-0447479)
[15:44:42] <emanuele6> sed -i '/c/s/a/b/' file ->   printf '%s\n' 'g/c/s/a/b/' 'x' | ex -s file
[15:46:00] <emanuele6> ex (even POSIX ex) can do most things that sed can do and has the x command
[15:46:36] <emanuele6> the only "downside" is that you can't do:   ex -sc '%s/a/b/g|x' file1 file2
[15:47:08] <emanuele6> you need to do something like: for f in file1 file2; do ex -sc '%s/a/b/g|x' -- "$f"; done   if you have multiple files

[16:31:58] <emanuele6> also note that if you have vim / you can depend on vim, you can use: vim -Es -c 'argdo %s/a/b/g' -c 'xa' -- file1 file2 file3
[16:34:50] <emanuele6> which avoids having to loop
[16:35:01] <emanuele6> but vim is not a standard tool obviously

[17:51:08] <irrgit> What am I doing wrong here? I am trying to grab two groups and use backref to print them.  -> sed  -E -r 's/^(\d{6}).+\ (\d{1,3})/\1 \2/'   data -> http://sprunge.us/OplpVc 
[17:51:24] <irrgit> Its outputting the whole lines, even ones it doesnt match 
[17:52:05] <emanuele6> -E and -r do the same thing
[17:52:16] <emanuele6> and you are using PCRE regexes
[17:52:39] <emanuele6> -E/-r in GNU sed let's you use ERE regexes, not PCRE regexes
[17:53:42] <irrgit> sed --version
[17:53:42] <irrgit> sed (GNU sed) 4.8
[17:53:42] <emanuele6> here you don't even need ERE syntax, just use regular BREs
[17:54:00] <emanuele6> yes, you are not using ERE, \d is not ERE, it is perl
[17:54:49] <Soliton> sed -E 's/^([0-9]{6}).+ ([0-9]{1,3})/\1 \2/'
[17:55:07] <emanuele6> i think irrgit wants \.
[17:55:16] <emanuele6> sed -E 's/^([0-9]{6})\.+ ([0-9]{1,3})/\1 \2/'
[17:56:09] <irrgit> ah I see. For some reason its still printing lines it doesnt match, as well as the comma at the end
[17:56:09] <Soliton> right, hadn't looked at the data.
[17:56:31] <Soliton> lines that don't match don't get substitutions.
[17:56:37] <Soliton> they don't vanish.
[17:56:38] <emanuele6> yes, s is that substitute command
[17:56:55] <Soliton> perhaps you want sed -n s///p
[17:57:25] <emanuele6> sed -nE 's/^([0-9]{6})\.+ ([0-9]{1,3}).*/\1 \2/p'
[17:57:39] <emanuele6> also .* at the end of the regex
[17:57:51] <emanuele6> so that everything after the second number gets deleted
[17:58:09] <irrgit> emanuele6, that did it, thank you
[17:58:30] <emanuele6> if you want it to be similar to \d in perl, you should use [[:digit:]] instead of [0-9]
[17:59:15] <emanuele6> and if you want to do it in portable sed, with BRE regexes, it is: sed -n 's/^\([[:digit:]]\{6\}\)\.\.* \([[:digit:]]\{1,3\}\).*/\1 \2/p'
[17:59:24] <irrgit> Perl was the first language I learned, I dont even look at it anymore 
[18:00:37] <irrgit> Thanks again. Maybe I should have read my sed & awk book instead of letting it collect dust.
[18:01:20] <irrgit> The data was from a range of pdf files using pdftotext to extract item numbers and pages. I'm so happy right now 
[18:01:55] <emanuele6> :)
[18:01:55] <irrgit> My previous version was a two step solution, outputting the file and then using python, with the initial regex to extract the data. Now its 1 line!

[18:46:17] <Iarla> Can someone tell me if sed is suitable for this job? I have a file with several paragraphs (updated daily). Each paragraph has the pattern [F-W][a-z][a-z], [A-Z][a-z][a-z] [0-9] on the first line. Paragraphs are seperated by a blank line (possibly containing tabs/spaces). I want to rearrange the paragraphs according to the pattern mentioned, which is a date.
[18:47:41] <emanuele6> not really
[18:48:11] <Iarla> thanks. Better to know before starting.
[18:48:47] <Soliton> awk has a paragraph mode.
[18:48:56] <Iarla> interesting!
[18:49:31] *** Joins: fcr (~fran@r167-60-98-22.dialup.adsl.anteldata.net.uy)
[18:50:14] <emanuele6> Soliton: RS="\n\n" would not work in this case
[18:50:49] <emanuele6> because the paragraph delimiter is a blank line "possibly containing tabs/spaces"
[18:50:58] <emanuele6> and RS cannot be a regex
[18:52:31] <Iarla> Maybe I could repalce those lines with *** by using ^[[:space:]]*$ to select them first
[18:54:01] <emanuele6> i think you mean [[:blank:]]
[18:54:59] <Iarla> according to the advice I got (which made my script finally work), :space: accounts for empty lines with or without tabs/spaces whereas :blank: does not.
[18:55:40] <emanuele6> no, that does not make sense
[18:56:10] <emanuele6> /^[[:blank:]]*$/ will match a blank line just like  /^[[:space:]]*$/ 
[18:56:21] <emanuele6> the (whatever)* can match nothing
[18:57:13] <Iarla> ah
[18:57:17] <emanuele6> anyway, i don't think it is necessary to replace them first, just handle paragraphs with !/[^[:blank:]]/ { ++paragraph_numer; handle_end_of_paragraph(); next } or something like that in your awk script 
[18:57:44] <Soliton> :blank: is space or tab, :space: alsow includes other whitespace.
[18:58:03] <emanuele6> Iarla: [:blank:] is just space and tab (locale may add something else) while [:space:] is also \n, vertical tab, etc
[18:58:17] <emanuele6> space is any whitespace, blank is just horizontal whitespace
[19:01:28] <Iarla> I see. Thanks for that.
[19:02:52] <Iarla> Looks like there's a stackexchange for just this - I don't believe it :)
[19:03:18] <Iarla> Actually, not really.
