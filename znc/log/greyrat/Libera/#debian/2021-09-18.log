[00:54:40] <calamari> I'd like to print a PDF where the page is much smaller than US Letter. I tried Atril (Evince) but it was not up to the task (it printed off the edge). I also tried Adobe Reader 9, but it couldn't print at all, I guess it's too old now. Are there any other alternatives?
[00:55:12] <calamari> *page->paper
[00:55:23] <Khepra> calamari: I'd start by checking if your printer (driver) options supports "fit to page" zooming of content
[00:55:41] <calamari> Khepra: not necessary, the page content is the correct size already
[00:55:55] <Khepra> then I'm afraid I misunderstood your question. can you elaborate?
[00:56:41] <calamari> Khepra: I'll make it simpler, sorry. Which GUI PDF programs can print besides Atril/Evince?
[00:56:48] <Khepra> I assumed you had PDF defined for US Letter and the physical paper is much smaller
[00:57:21] <calamari> Khepra: No everything was defined (printer, paper, and PDF) to the smaller size
[00:58:09] <Khepra> then I don't understand your problem at all. but, besides evince there's zathura, and you can import pdf into inkscape or gimp (but rasterized) if it's a single page

[02:58:01] <somiaj> Yea, I find cups fairly straight forward these days and a nice webinterface to manage it, though I think many things are even getting easier with ipp and no longer requiring the overhead of cups for those who don't want it, but no need to switch if you like cups
[02:58:21] <wr> in need for some help on Debian 11 update my auto mount external hard is not working
[02:58:42] <wr> maybe fstab something is not ok
[02:59:30] <wr> the disk is on ntfs
[03:01:15] <wr> https://wiki.debian.org/NTFS maybe
[03:02:02] <somiaj> wr: check out the release notes, ntfs changed in 11
[03:02:28] <somiaj> there is now a native ntfs driver in the kernel, so no need for the ntfs-3g fuse layer, so this does require change, one second
[03:03:29] <somiaj> oh wait, I'm mistaken, it was exFAT that had an update in 11, not ntfs
[03:03:39] <wr> this https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/amd64/release-notes.en.pdf ? what do you suggest i use now
[03:03:41] <somiaj> wr: what is your fstab entry for this drive?
[03:03:54] <somiaj> https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/release-notes/ch-whats-new.en.html#exfat-in-linux-kernel
[03:04:05] <somiaj> I was mistaken, it was exFAT not ntfs that had the change
[03:04:06] <Khepra> somiaj: hold on.... "now?" you mean the paragon's ?
[03:04:26] <Khepra> yes, paragon's NTFS will land in 5.15 (maybe)
[03:04:43] <somiaj> wr: so I was mistaken, sorry about that, lets look at the details, what is your fstab entry for this device, what isn't working?
[03:05:04] <somiaj> also any reason you have an fstab entry, most automounters will mount ntfs automatically if you have ntfs-3g included
[03:05:19] <wr> somiaj, i have this https://paste.debian.net/1212187/ normally i don't like to touch this much cause i don't know exactly what i'm changing

[03:06:04] <somiaj> what desktop do you use?
[03:06:18] <wr> somiaj, on Debian 10 i had thunar and auto mount and the external drives always showed up, but now not
[03:06:32] <wr> xfce
[03:06:48] <somiaj> that is strange, I wonder why the drive isn't appearing in thunar and automounting.
[03:06:58] <wr> me too
[03:07:01] <somiaj> wr: do yo uhave the package 'ntfs-3g' installed? Are you positive this is an ntfs drive (not an exFAT)?
[03:07:06] <wr> yes

[03:34:40] <Powerhouse6666> I was expecting to see the option to boot from Live USB here
[03:35:33] <knotMez> if a Debian source package fails to build is it a bug?
[03:36:33] <dob1> I have a munin plugin that it's not visualized, running munin-run plugin   and running sudo -u munin -c bash "munin-run plugin" works, gives me data. but no update
[03:36:35] <Khepra> Powerhouse6666: no, that's... you don't have one grub for all the bootable devices. each has its own grub menu
[03:36:43] <somiaj> knotMez: depends, is the source package built for the version of debian installed? have you tested it in a clean chroot with all the build-depends.
[03:36:58] <dob1> I am not able to find any error on log
[03:37:06] <knotMez> somiaj I know why it is not building
[03:37:08] <Powerhouse6666> Khepra, I see.  Okay so when I load from Live USB I will see a Grub2 from Debian 11
[03:37:10] <Khepra> Powerhouse6666: so it's possible your VM isn't even trying to boot off of the ISO -- for that, see what somiaj listed above, I don't know virt-manager gui button sequences to set that up; I prefer qemu-kvm on the cli

[03:38:33] <somiaj> knotMez: and is this an issue with a clean chroot for the version of debian the source packgae is built for?
[03:38:54] <knotMez> somiaj it is not building because the package pulls in other code that it builds against and the main package is too bitrotted to build against it
[03:38:59] *** Joins: SamantazFox (~SamantazF@user/samantazfox)
[03:39:34] <joepublic> are you trying to say it doesn't build because a dependency doesn't build?  or just that magic bits fall out.
[03:39:39] <knotMez> somiaj and apparently the Debian patches do not fix it
[03:39:47] <somiaj> knotMez: By pulls in other code, you mean from the internet? Debian packages by policy should not be pulling in code to build.
[03:40:02] <knotMez> somiaj well that's not how this works
[03:40:39] <somiaj> what package is it? To me the bug is it is pulling in code from the internet to build.
[03:40:46] <Khepra> at this stage I believe you should be more precise with which package it is, and perhaps pastebin the build log
[03:40:47] <knotMez> somiaj all I did was download the source package and run configure
[03:40:53] <knotMez> somiaj it is mplayer
[03:41:05] <dob1> I found the issue... I had to restart munin but why? I didn't added the plugin today it was just there I just reboot the pc
[03:41:13] <somiaj> you don't build debian packages by running ./configure, your use dpkg-buildpackage, or some equivlant.
[03:41:38] <knotMez> somiaj I'll give that a shot
[03:41:47] <somiaj> the debian rules should be setup so it doesn't pull in code from the internet. Though mplayer is kinda dead in debian, is it still in sid?
[03:41:58] <Khepra> dob1: you mean restarted munin-node? yes, that you have to
[03:42:01] <somiaj> mpv is now what is actually being released with debian releases.

[03:42:13] <knotMez> somiaj I do not know i run Bullseye but i can see the package getting dropped
[03:42:26] <dob1> Khepra, it's not a new plugin

[03:46:50] <somiaj> knotMez: That is not how debian packages work, it should be building agains the build-depends yo uinstall on your system.
[03:46:51] <knotMez> it doesn't use the system library
[03:47:00] <knotMez> somiaj well it is how mplayer works
[03:47:13] <knotMez> somiaj it is now the deb source works too
[03:47:33] <wr> somiaj, sorry had to check somethings, here, both disks are showing 0kb even on win10 i have to check and then i return, i can't believe something came here and deleted both, but, well see
[03:47:37] <somiaj> That is a grave policy bug, I doubt it, sounds like you are building it correctly.
[03:47:41] <Khepra> dob1: there's just one service, munin-node, you can restart. check the plugin; it has several stages, one of which is autoconf or whatwas it, which tells the node if it _can_ be used. if that checks for existence of something that's not availalbe, it won't tell munin it's ready to be used
[03:47:57] <somiaj> aren't building it correctly
[03:48:11] <knotMez> somiaj why does it sound that way?
[03:48:22] <somiaj> because debian policy is to not download source when building a package.

[03:49:12] <somiaj> knotMez: then what did you do?
[03:49:28] <knotMez> somiaj I entered the directory and ran configure
[03:49:31] <knotMez> then make
[03:49:38] <somiaj> that is not how you build debian source packages
[03:49:41] <Powerhouse6666> Khepra, okay looking for location
[03:49:44] <knotMez> why isn't it?
[03:49:59] <knotMez> I was not looking to package it up
[03:50:05] <somiaj> because you use the debian tools and the debian/rules script, 'dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b' would be what you run
[03:50:25] <Khepra> knotMez: because that's building the package completely outside debian's rules, patches and entier framework behind it
[03:50:27] <wr> somiaj, i connected a thing wd i have, and on Win10 i see the folder, here on Debian 11 64bits not, so, something is wrong, maybe my updates changed something
[03:50:31] <somiaj> knotMez: then what you have is not a bug, since you are avoiding all the debian patches and build process
[03:50:53] <Khepra> "can" you? sure. if it even works wihtout applied patches (whichi requires debian packge building framework in effect)
[03:50:57] <dob1> Khepra, and the check happen not at every run?
[03:51:04] <knotMez> Khepra it patched when I ran apt-get source mplayer
[03:51:15] <knotMez> somiaj  it patched when I ran apt-get source mplayer
[03:51:17] <somiaj> no that doens't apply the patches, the patches are applied at build time
[03:51:20] <Khepra> dob1: munin-node loads once, and checks the plugins aviailability once, on startup.

[03:54:28] <dob1> Khepra, there is an xautoconf section in the script that does this check
[03:54:57] <somiaj> note you are still skipping the debian build process. I'm use to the patches being applied when you run dpkg-buildpackage, so I could have been mistaken that they aren't applied at start
[03:55:02] <Khepra> dob1: what does it do exactly?
[03:55:18] <somiaj> but if you avoid the debian build process, you also avoid the debian overrides, like use your version of ffmpeg vs some random one it downloadds during the build
[03:55:43] <knotMez> somiaj that does seem like the only viable solution to me
[03:55:55] <somiaj> so what you have experinced is not a bug
[03:56:02] <dob1> Khepra, this https://paste.debian.net/hidden/81de3c34/
[03:56:12] <Khepra> so in short, runinng ./configure and <something something> breaks, is not a bug to report against the package.
[03:56:18] <somiaj> you can look at the debian/rules script if you want to see what is needed to force it to use the ffmpeg installed via 'apt build-dep mplayer'
[03:56:40] <Khepra> dob1: yup that's it, it signals to node it's not ready to be used
[03:56:47] <knotMez> somiaj I already have all of the deps installed
[03:56:56] <Khepra> that's wrong place to run a check that depends on _runtime_, not _configure_ time state
[03:57:02] <knotMez> I ran apt-get build-dep mplayer
[03:57:06] <somiaj> knotMez: again the way you are building it avoids the debian framework, so it is not a bug against the package.
[03:57:22] <dob1> Khepra, and this is permanent as you said, I need to restart the node for a recheck
[03:57:52] <somiaj> knotMez: for what it is worth, it is building just fine for me, waiting for it to finish
[03:58:04] <Khepra> dob1: is that some packaged plugin, or a custom one?
[03:58:07] <knotMez> somiaj on what version of Debian?
[03:58:07] <somiaj> and it didn't download anything from the internet to build
[03:58:19] <wr> somiaj, when i have data showing as raw does it mean the data is there or something deleted?
[03:58:20] <Khepra> dob1: yeah the "autoconf" trigger happens on node start
[03:58:20] <dob1> Khepra, it's not a default one in debian packages
[03:58:44] <somiaj> wr: I'm not sure, got distracted. Anyways, you can see the files just fine in windows?
[03:59:06] <Khepra> dob1: you can remove that whole if-fi section, and let it fail at runtime instead -- unless that'd increase processing due to timeouts
[03:59:14] <wr> somiaj, by the way i was seeing it on win10, no, see explorer on 0kb disk shows up
[03:59:40] <somiaj> wr: so you don't actually see any of the data on it in windows either?
[03:59:47] <somiaj> wr: sounds like something has clobbered your filesystem
[03:59:50] <dob1> Khepra, I was going to add the echo "yes" to the connect fail part too
[04:00:40] <Khepra> dob1: or that, yeah
[04:00:46] <wr> yes, can't see them, but they were turned off both
[04:01:01] <wr> they are external ones been off for weeks
[04:01:16] <dob1> Khepra, thanks for help
[04:01:38] <Khepra> dob1: ideally, if you knwo how, you can rewrite the plugin to run the check at runtime (no params given to the script); and maybe return 0s for properly formatted labels, or whatever the plugin does
[04:01:48] <wr> somiaj, 1 option, someone came here touched the disks and deleted something, i wonder, but i have alarm on house

[04:05:17] <knotMez> I run apt-get source mplayer and then dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b and it says "dpkg-buildpackage: error: cannot open file debian/changelog: No such file or directory"
[04:05:44] <Khepra> dob1: that's why it should check at run-time, if the socket is not avilable, just return some kind of dummy values.  I can't remember if munin had a way to specify "no value" as valid output, so it doesn't go into rrds as a value; ends up as gaps in the graphs
[04:06:34] <wr> somiaj, on win10 the usb pen drive shows up ok, on Debian tried a couple usb ports, and not showing up, as soon i solve this, the enigma i'm gonna backu to a third disk and deleted two to and recreate the partitions on ntfs or ext4, ah wait, i don't remember well if i changed to ext4

[05:20:17] <jcbjoe2021> hi. haven't been on irc in a minute. haven't used debian in a minute. got a macbook pro mid 2018 and want to try linux again. thought about debian
[05:21:12] <jcbjoe2021> i remember there was buster being released and we only went to oftc for stuff like that. has anything changed besides being on freenode?

[05:22:53] <Blondie101010> but it's not the latest

[05:23:32] <Blondie101010> someone should fix the buster factoid, but I'm sure I'd mess it up

[05:24:30] <dpkg> OK, greycat

[05:35:26] <wr> greycat, i do dual boot's on VM's if they fail i just duplicate, but today i am upgrading all hardware and seeing backups, this usually takes a week
[05:35:32] <jcbjoe2021> is it wrong to want linux even though you are on a mac even though it uses BSD?

[06:17:00] <rk4> we're in a funny time, FLOSS is wildly successful by some measures, but i don't think most users don't actually care, so we end up with things like rust being a FLOSS project out of mozilla, developed on github, with the official chat moved from irc to discord (iirc), this is typical of modern projects imho

[06:27:08] <sney> I would recommend the web search on https://ircbots.debian.net/factoids/
[06:27:32] <greycat> Is there a limit on that one too?  If not, why not?
[06:27:50] <sney> I've never hit a limit on it, plus it will display more than one factoid per query
[06:28:12] <velix> What's the way to name packages, which are build for a special distribution only, e.g. Buster or Bullseye?
[06:28:33] <greycat> Hmm, maybe it didn't respond to flw84 because I coincidentally reached the limit on flw* factoids at the same time I made the bot angry.

[06:29:49] <sney> velix: you can put any kind of string in your package version to indicate what it's targeted for, but you would need to use specific dependencies to make it only installable on one release

[06:35:50] <velix> ". But one dependency in there neither was in Buster, nor Bullseye. it was for ubuntu only. So it would be nice to tag the file "_buster" or "_bullseye" or "_whateverubuntu"

[06:37:40] <somiaj> can underscroes be part of the version?
[06:38:06] <somiaj> but maybe look at debian security patches for ideas of ways to flag packages with a version string to give info about it.
[06:38:25] <velix> somiaj: or maybe backports?
[06:39:28] <velix> somiaj: security is ~deb11u1
[06:39:29] <somiaj> yea I'm not seeing underscore as an allowed character, but I didn't read too closely
[06:39:34] <somiaj> http://www.fifi.org/doc/debian-policy/policy.html/ch-versions.html
[06:40:17] <velix> but that's for the VERSION, not for the filename.
[06:40:41] <somiaj> I also have seen versions like 2:7.3.429-2ubuntu2.1, so if needed you can include info about what the package is for in the version. Though I personally think it should be clear what release it was compiled for in the download location
[06:41:16] <somiaj> sure, but the file name is created in a standard, I guess you could rename it, but I think if you wanted to flag something, use the version
[06:41:43] <velix> somiaj: but ":" in the filename? Even on Windows I've never seen that :)
[06:41:47] <velix> eeeh even on Linux*
[06:42:08] <somiaj> debian versions use that for the epoch, so it occurs in file names what have an epoch I belive
[06:42:16] <velix> I think adding ~deb9u1 makes most sense.
[06:42:27] <velix> t-rex_0.14.0_amd64~deb10u1.deb

[06:42:52] <somiaj> ahh it looks like it leaves the epoch off of the file name when cerating it
[06:43:22] <somiaj> well if you added it to the version the auto gen file would be t-rex_0.14.0~deb11u1_amd64.deb
[06:43:30] <velix> interesting.
[06:43:37] <velix> because it's like chromium_73.0.3683.75-1~deb9u1.dsc
[06:43:47] <velix> ah, becasue there's no arch
[06:43:48] <somiaj> because it is packagename_version_arch.deb
[06:43:51] <velix> yep
[06:43:54] <somiaj> yea the dsc file wouldn't contain the arch
[06:43:58] <velix> yep
[06:44:06] <velix> makes sense.

[06:46:44] <velix> So normally, it would looks like: 0.14.0-1~deb11u1
[06:46:50] <greycat> if there's no - in the version string, then it's a Debian-authored package
[06:46:50] <velix> is ~deb11u1 part of debian_revision?
[06:46:59] <somiaj> yes
[06:47:13] <greycat> ,v t-rex
[06:47:14] <judd> No package named 't-rex' was found in amd64.
[06:47:17] <somiaj> all you need to do is add a new entry to debian/changelog to get the version string you want
[06:47:20] <velix> greycat: there's none now.
[06:47:59] <velix> somiaj: It's auto-created by rust/cargo ... I'm not planning a Debian package release. I just want to fix his issues ;)
[06:48:00] <greycat> So this isn't even a Debian package at all?  And you expect it to conform to Debian version number standards?
[06:48:27] <velix> greycat: Actually, I just want to make it a bit more clear. He's using t-rex_0.14.0_amd64.deb only, without telling that it's for Ubuntu.
[06:48:41] <velix> greycat: t-rex.0.14.0-1~deb11u1 would clearly say: Bullseye!
[06:48:52] <greycat> ... then ... why ... the hell ... are they HERE
[06:49:08] <velix> Sorry :(
[06:49:15] <velix> I'll better leave.
[06:49:18] <somiaj> Adding info to the file name/version isn't really telling people. Make it clear by the repo name or the download page.

[08:57:32] <catbeard> dpkg: cp is probably better

[08:57:42] <sney> dpkg: are you a bot?
[08:57:43] <dpkg> I ain't no stinkin' bot.  I am a finely tuned and hand crafted tool.  Oh wait... I guess I am a bot (that you should not abuse).
[08:58:47] <sney> cp is better than dd because it's simpler and usually faster by default, but both cp and dd will result in an image being written to a usb stick without problems, so that kind of tool preference is not relevant
[08:59:02] <sney> you could use cat, too. same result.

[09:15:56] <hiya> sney: OK trying with ventoy now, is it in repo?
[09:16:37] <sney> no, you have to get it from that website (for now)
[09:17:58] <hiya> sney: so what to do with it? flash ISO?
[09:18:29] <sney> step 1) read the instructions on ventoy.net
[09:19:11] <hiya> no I mean do I need to do this when I am done flashing debian ISO on USB?
[09:19:52] <sney>  <dpkg> Ventoy is an open-source utility to facilitate booting .iso images from USB storage. It installs grub to the USB, and then uses grub to select among multiple .iso images on the USB.
[09:20:12] <hiya> so I copy .iso to USB ?
[09:20:19] <sney> that's what it say.s
[09:20:33] <sney> and if you go to ventoy.net and read the instructions, it says the same thing!
[09:20:47] <sney> I will not explain how to do it, because you can just follow the instructions.
[09:22:05] <hiya> Yes I got it yo
[09:22:29] <hiya> I hope Ventoy helps. if not then we need to file a bug
[09:22:49] <Blondie101010> for that you need to find the problem
[09:23:56] <Blondie101010> it could help to compare it with another computer

[09:41:34] <Blondie101010> ok so it's the computer and not the key itself
[09:41:50] <hiya> so UEFI only boot isn't working for Debian ISO live gnome
[09:41:50] <alkisg> And when you select debian, does ventoy show a quick message before it drops you into a grub shell? That's what I wanted to see in a video
[09:41:55] <alkisg> E.g. loopback failed or vmlinuz not found...
[09:43:01] <Blondie101010> why would loopback fail...  I don't think it tries to open vmlinuz yet
[09:43:25] <Blondie101010> it has to be some low level thing about usb or the drive

It does not even blink the screen. It shows boot-up messages and then just sits there with no error message. When I switch to another terminal and type "startx", Plasma starts. Any idea
[12:55:37] <schwarzer> what could go on here with SDDM not starting? I tried removing the "quiet" from grub but there is no suspicous looking messages. journalctl -eu sddm does not show anything special either. ... I also updated the system to Sid and later also with kernel and xorg stuff from experimental to see if newer drivers might solve the problem. No luck so far.

I don't know what "server" you mean; virt-manager is a GUI tool, so if there's (headless) VM servers involved, you should be using qemu-system-x86_64 (or appropriate) directly -- they both allow you to define "cdrom" option which is an .iso file, and boot from it (-boot d -cdrom /path/to/iso)

[13:29:34] <hanthana> thanks, any specific  solution/workaround to over come this and build a package with circular dependency?
[13:30:00] <Khepra> you have to break the dependency somehow, no other way
[13:30:27] <Khepra> you have to build A or B with a config option that makes it NOT depend on the other, then build the other then rebuild the first one WITH that option that caused circular dep
[13:33:40] <Khepra> hanthana: so which package is this? I doubt a debian package would have a circular dep, because solving it is manual work, cannot automate builds

[13:46:31] <schwarzer> Yes, experimental has 5.14.
[13:47:12] <hiya> So, backported kernel would be 5.14?
[13:47:20] <Khepra> maybe
[13:48:05] <Khepra> whatever sid upgrades to, and then whtever the maintainer decides to pull into bullseye-backports; which won't be fixed, as sid upgrades, so will probably the backported one.
[13:48:34] <Khepra> ... won't be fixed version; as sid upgrades, so will the backported kernel.

[13:49:40] <jelly> hiya, backports only come from testing to stable.  There won't be a newer kernel in backports until there's a newer kernel in bookworm (current testing)

[13:50:31] <hiya> Khepra: no standard repo
[13:50:52] <Khepra> oh right, testing... I skipped a step. but wasn't wrong too much, testing follows sid until stabilization, even if with a delay

[13:51:26] <judd> No package named 'slack-desktop' was found in amd64.

[13:51:58] <hiya> ok i ask
[13:52:12] <Khepra> hiya: meanwhile I suppose you can install slack from the snaps, or flatpaks
[13:53:25] <jelly> it is not too big a deal to add back repos for an _older_ release, if you really need it
[13:53:33] <Khepra> jelly: oh, btw, that amdgpu issue I have that requires newer mesa and libvulkan? third variable just came in. I need to backport a patch from 5.11 to 5.10. think I can persude the kernel folks to do that for the stable kernel? it's a tiny patch, assuming nothing else is needed, just ot recognize the navy flounder IDs:

[13:54:11] <jelly> Khepra, that kind of thing, hardware support, gets accepted by the kernel team if it's simple enough
[13:54:25] <hiya> ,v mesa
[13:54:26] <judd> No package named 'mesa' was found in amd64.
[13:54:33] <Khepra> yeah I'll frist try it myself to see if that's all that's needed (plus firmware of course)

[13:57:47] <Khepra> oh wait... it IS backported...

[13:58:06] <hiya> apparently
[13:58:22] <Khepra> still, I need this now, can't wait for backports to come months away probably
[13:59:37] <Khepra> I currently run an abomination.... containerized xorg-mesa stack from gentoo atop of bullseye host, with kernel.org kernel. terrible thing but you know what? that's the power of foss. :)
[14:00:45] <hiya> Sorry if I am off-topic, but I have tried a lot of distro in life, nothing matches the stability / feel of debian when it finally supports your new hardware. Buntu-based is ok ok, Debian rocks! I am always back to Debian after few weeks of wandering.
[14:01:38] <Khepra> true that. however stale-bian it seems sometimes, you often quickly find out why that's not so bad :)

And when it asks you for password on boot to unlock the disk, there is a wait period of couple seconds [10-15 secs] before you finally get to grub and into Debian OS. It isn't there in Buntu-based, Fedora or Manjaro. Do you notice the same?
[14:05:05] <Khepra> sorry, I don't have experience with encrypted /boot, otehr than trying it once few years ago

[14:06:47] <hiya> ok, anyone else here noticed it? Because on other distro, I get to desktop in 10-12 secs totally, but with Debian only there is this wait. It is on old laptop too.
[14:07:16] <hiya> Khepra: Can you help me diagnose it ?
[14:07:59] <Khepra> you can compare `cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sdX` between debian and "other distro"; pastebin both if you need help
[14:08:22] <Khepra> where sdX is the encrypted /boot  (I am assuming that, as you mentioned grub menu appearing _after_ unlocking)

[14:20:38] <Khepra> hiya: that's luks version 1, and I'm not sure those numbers are on the same scale as pbkdf2 key algos for luks2; but if they ARE ... that would very much explain long unlocking times.
[14:21:07] <Khepra> hiya: can you try to unlock that container from another boot session? like a rescue env, or seems like you have dual booting there?

[14:22:58] <Khepra> anyhoo... if you ahve an USB live env, some rescue env, something you can boot into and then try to unlock "Partition 2", that'll show you if my hunch about too many iterations is correct, or it isn't but then grub has some issue

[14:33:24] <Khepra> lowin: understandable, that's why I'm mentioning the cause of those issues. personally I find the feature and benefits _currently_ outweigh the bad design of it, and knowing most issues are caused by bad maintainer decisions, I can fix it and make my life easier.  or you can hate it and still have the issue, maybe even ragequit into devuan.
[14:34:26] <Khepra> this is true with most of FOSS or software in general, FOSS only gives you the ability to fix it yourself. Like right now, past few months, I've been involved in a longwar of attrition with amdgpu and its support in kernel, firmware, vulkan and mesa.

[14:37:50] <Khepra> PamiPetteri: some swap is always used. by default, swappiness of 60 means it'll page out memory it thinks is unused, even though it's not strictly needed.

[14:38:44] <Khepra> being on a scale from 1 to 200 (now on bullseye, up to 100 on earlier releases), greater swappiness means more likely to page out unused memory.

[14:44:51] <Khepra> PamiPetteri: "suspend" is not using swap, it suspends the system in RAM. again, some usage of swap is not weird, in fact it's always good it pages out unused memory; it becomes bad when you have a swapstorm

[14:58:33] <lowin> Khepra, could be, but it doesn't exist in a fresh install or a fresh new user

[15:00:54] <lowin> Khepra, I checked dbus messages before, but couldn't find much about it. the only hint was, something telling the xfce4 audio plugin that the volume got muted
[15:01:34] <lowin> pulseaudio logs also show the volume getting muted but I can't find what triggers it, it's as if someone pressed the mute button on the keyboard

[15:08:35] <yang> yes
[15:08:38] <yang> on the same SSD
[15:09:04] <Khepra> so the kernel _can_ access it, because it needs to load initramfs and load all the modules that are apparently loaded in that paste
[15:10:39] <Khepra> so that waiting for root device... is likely not due to hw needing initialization; are you sure that's correct mountpoint for rootfs? is there nothing else logged after (no "quiet" or "splash" in comand, that would cut off the output at that moment?)

[19:00:25] <Khepra> no_gravity: that's a rather very broad question
[19:01:32] <Khepra> do you have a rescue system you can boot into and check partition flags?
[19:01:35] <no_gravity> Khepra: I booted from the Debian Live stick, manually partitioned a "bios boot partition" or something, a "boot" partition and a root partition.
[19:01:46] *** Joins: sinaowolabi (~SinaOwola@102.89.3.65)
[19:01:56] <no_gravity> Khepra: Yes, but I first have to swap the new disk in again. Give me 5 minutes...
[19:02:03] <Khepra> yea bios_boot is needed if you boot from gpt in bios/legacy mode
[19:02:13] <Khepra> or is it bios_grub, I always forget
[19:02:31] <no_gravity> Khepra: i don't think I boot in legacy mode.
[19:02:53] <Khepra> well if you boot in EFI, you'll need an ESP, and the bios_grub or bios_boot whatev, is not used at all
[19:03:20] <no_gravity> ESP?
[19:03:22] <Khepra> maybe reboot into a rescue mode and pastebin the partition layout.   parted /dev/sdX unit mib print     for example
[19:03:26] <Khepra> EFI System Partition
[19:03:41] <Khepra> the FAT32 partition that contains the kernel stubs and other EFI boot things
[19:03:59] <no_gravity> What is a kernel stub?
[19:04:43] <Khepra> https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/efi-stub.html
[19:05:39] <no_gravity> Let me try to grasp it this way: What is the minimum number of partitions needed to boot debian 11 on an UEFI system?
[19:05:47] <Khepra> two
[19:05:55] <Khepra> ESP and rootfs
[19:06:32] <no_gravity> rootfs is mounted to /?
[19:06:41] <Khepra> yes
[19:06:45] <no_gravity> And esp?
[19:07:21] <Khepra> typically mounted under /boot/efi  and that's default location for grub-install (from grub-efi package), when it installs itself in EFI configuration
[19:07:55] <no_gravity> Does all of the above also hold true when / is encrypted?
[19:08:32] <Khepra> some preefer to combine /boot and efi things so /boot is on the FAT32 partition and shares the space with "EFI" that is the first directory on an ESP (so EFI files are on /boot/efi/EFI/<some name>)
[19:08:46] <no_gravity> That sounds good.
[19:08:47] <Khepra> no_gravity: no. with encrypted root, you need unencrypted /boot, so that makes it 3 partitions minium
[19:09:13] <no_gravity> Khepra: Even when /boot and /boot/efi share a partition?
[19:09:13] <Khepra> unless you encrypt /boot as well, so /boot is part of rootfs, but I don't know how that works with ESP
[19:09:44] <Khepra> no_gravity: if they share, that'd be 2 but I wouldn't recommend putting /boot onto FAT32
[19:09:57] <no_gravity> Why not?
[19:10:12] <Khepra> simple reason is some tools require fully posix functional filesystem, which FAT32 is not. symlinks wouldn't work for example
[19:10:32] <no_gravity> I see.
[19:10:47] <Khepra> it may work flawless, it may not work at all, depending on conditions I'm not fully familiar with; I just remember issues with /boot atop of FAT32
[19:11:26] <no_gravity> So I think I did everythin right. Why ain't this baby booting?
[19:11:35] <no_gravity> Should I boot into the Debian 11 live stick?
[19:11:56] <Khepra> no_gravity: well reboot into a rescue mode and please pastebin the partition layout. then confirm whether you have UEFI system only, or it is capable of BIOS/legacy boot
[19:12:08] <no_gravity> What is a rescue mode?
[19:12:18] <Khepra> some kind of linux live environment you can boot into
[19:12:31] <no_gravity> Lke Debian 11 live?
[19:12:45] <Khepra> sorry I often use the same term to mean that and literal systemd's rescue mode, or even ISO installer's "rescue mode" grub option
[19:13:03] *** Joins: craigevil (craig@user/craigevil)
[19:13:06] <no_gravity> Now I am confused.
[19:13:17] <Khepra> what I mean is a live linux env from which you can inspect the partitions, optionally change them, and ultimately if needed chroot to fix the configuration
[19:13:31] <no_gravity> I'll boot into the Debian 11 live stick ...
[19:13:34] <Khepra> debian 11 live would work I think, yes
[19:14:09] <no_gravity> When it booted, what do I do?
[19:14:40] <Khepra> if there's `parted`, please pastebin     `parted /dev/sda unit mib print`   assuming /dev/sda is the disk in question
[19:16:21] <no_gravity> pastebin is tricky as debian does not recognize my wifi out of the box
[19:18:43] <Khepra> can you set it up? or ultimately take a photo with your phone and post it to imgur
[19:19:25] <no_gravity> Oh, the state is from a second attempt that I did after the first failed.
[19:19:34] <no_gravity> And where I tried to do it in legacy mode.
[19:19:39] <no_gravity> Which also failed :)

[20:04:14] <Khepra> no_gravity: you know what you can do... fire back the installer, prepare partitions manually from another TTY, so when you get to the partitioning stage -> manual, it'll autodetect and see what you prepared for it, so you just select them for their appropriate roles (ESP, rootfs, /boot)

[20:06:54] <no_gravity> Khepra: I would like to figure out if it is possible to do it with the installer.
[20:06:55] <Khepra> no_gravity: I would assume so, which is why this is weird.  one possibility, that was never EFI mode and the installer didn't autodetect it
[20:07:16] <no_gravity> Khepra: If Debian does not support installation on my machine via the installer, I would not want to use it.

[20:25:44] <no_gravity> Khepra: Ah yes, I mean meltdown and spectre.

[20:26:44] <Khepra> yeah, it's mostly mitigations. proper fix requires x86 redesign. "Good luck with that" (tm)
[20:26:54] <PamiPetteri> by default a standard installation of Debian does not include the non-free and contrib repos. so people have to add those repos and install what they want by hand from the repos, like the non-free firmware upgrades/updates.
[20:27:38] <jelly> right.  it is by the grace of great Intel that Debian is able to redistribute microcode at all
[20:28:17] <Khepra> for a while they didn't allow it, iirc :) (alan) b'stards!
[20:28:26] <PamiPetteri> Intel is a big corporation.
[20:28:29] <jelly> previously, you had to wait for hw vendor to ship new BIOS/UEFI firmware
[20:28:46] <sney> as for firmware-realtek, if your network devices are already working without the firmware, installing that package will only silence some warnings that you may see during some package operations
[20:28:55] <no_gravity> That is pretty horrible. Are there more gotchas like this, that your Debian install is vurnurable out of the box and you don't know it?
[20:29:17] <PamiPetteri> Motorola is another, but AFAIK I have not used much Motorola so that I am aware of it. The Motorola cell phone's user interface looked different from Samsung's, so I wanted a Samsung phone.

[23:06:01] <johnjay> i forgot. why is /sbin not in root $PATH by default?

[23:06:32] <somiaj> It is in root's $PATH by default
[23:06:38] <somiaj> how are you logging into root?
[23:07:01] <johnjay> su
[23:07:13] <johnjay> does path not change when you do that?
[23:07:26] <somiaj> the issue is 'su' is not a login shell, it keeps the current enviorment
[23:07:28] <somiaj> !buster su
[23:07:28] <dpkg> Starting with buster, su no longer overrides PATH by default, requiring that you use "su -" or "su -l" for login shells (which is not really a new thing at all...). See https://wiki.debian.org/NewInBuster#Changes for details.
[23:08:05] <somiaj> Debian's su was considered unstandard since it changed the enviorment when using just 'su', and since buster it no longer changes the enviorment
[23:08:20] *** Joins: srv (~cmd@user/srv)
[23:08:25] <somiaj> Make sure you use a full login shell if you want to login as root, as opposed to gain root privlages with the current enviorment
[23:08:30] <johnjay> well. i guess that's my ignorance then
[23:08:59] <somiaj> To many it was an unexpected change, and very common issue
[23:09:12] <johnjay> i didn't realize the debian way was non standard
[23:09:13] <johnjay> ok
[23:09:29] <johnjay> kidna makes sense though. su literall just means switch user
[23:09:31] <somiaj> You might be able to dig up the bug report if you want more info
[23:09:41] <somiaj> yea, and 'su - user' means login as new user
[23:10:21] <somiaj> I think you can change the behavior to be back if you want, though since I use 'sudo -i' not something I have looked into

[23:11:31] <johnjay> yes i read something like that. interactive shell with sudo as opposed to just executing a command as another user
[23:11:41] <somiaj> Put ALWAYS_SET_PATH yes in /etc/default/su (create it) to get an approximation of the old behavior. This is documented in su(1).

[23:12:12] <johnjay> i suppose /etc/default/su is also "non-standard"?
[23:12:34] * jelly thought "su -" was "standard"
[23:13:19] <johnjay> su - is a very weird shortcut for su --login
[23:13:22] <somiaj> johnjay: that is a standard way to provide deaults in debian, but kinda depends on what you mean by standard.
[23:13:23] * jelly has been using "su -" since... uh, probably since before Linux.  Solaris 5.
[23:13:43] <johnjay> yeah i meant like. you will always have /et/sudoers
[23:13:51] <johnjay> but not necessarily /etc/default/su
[23:13:57] <jelly> johnjay, it's the other way round.  options with double -- would be a later GNU invention
[23:14:10] <johnjay> doesn't - mean something like "read from stdin"?
[23:14:20] <somiaj> johnjay: /etc/sudoers and /etc/default/su are indepednet tools
[23:14:35] <somiaj> johnjay: depends on the command
[23:15:05] <johnjay> jelly: i didn't know -- was a gnu invention. i think bsd does it too no?

[23:48:19] <Khepra> sudo is so 1980s. it's all about doas(1) these days.
[23:50:45] <alkisg> Does it support compatibility mode for /etc/sudoers?
[23:51:09] <Khepra> no idea, I was joking tho.
[23:52:16] <Khepra> oh, there's a debian wiki page for it too: https://wiki.debian.org/Doas
[23:53:35] <Khepra> one thing you gotta give to openbsd ecosystem tools... they don't require three PhDs and seven years in Tibet before you can understand the configuration syntax.
