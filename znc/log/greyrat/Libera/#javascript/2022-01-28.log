[00:40:22] <oscurochu> i apologize in advanced for asking what will probably be a vague question, but my react code is complaining about potential memory leaks due to some things. i'm not sure how well ill be able to reproduce the problem, to do its slight complexity, so i hope this description is enough. i have an onClick event, which executes an async function, that then executes an async fetch request and 3 state changes (3 diffe
[00:40:22] <oscurochu> rent state variables) afterwards. only one of the setState functions seems to be triggering the warning.

[02:54:26] <oscurochu> i have a setState() function defined higher up, and a setState() function defined deeper down. the deeper setState() is the one likely getting screwed up by the other two more "shallow" setState declarations. idk though. i can barely think. i have to be up early tomorrow so i had to force myself to wake up way earlier than im used to today
[02:54:55] <oscurochu> maybe i should move the problematic line to the useEffect() hook

[07:17:20] <o|||||o> again, i may have misunderstood what you are asking me to do
[07:18:44] <ThePendulum> oh right, do it like console.log('arts', arts); etc.
[07:18:51] <ThePendulum> otherwise it's going to stringify the objects like that

[07:30:27] <systemfault> o|||||o: Do you understand that .map doesn't mutate anything?
[07:30:28] <ThePendulum> in that last paste the order of `arts` before the map is different than in your previous one
[07:30:33] <systemfault> (Just to be sure)
[07:31:12] <ThePendulum> arts and arts after map have the same order, I guess if you run it another time it will change order again?
[07:31:17] <ThePendulum> however always the same before and after the map
[07:31:21] <o|||||o> systemfault, you mean that it creates a new array without modifying the old one, right?
[07:31:26] <ThePendulum> systemfault: he could've fucked up the logic inside the map but that looks fine to me
[07:31:41] <KevinX> Have to see one component higher
[07:31:46] <KevinX> Missing the key?
[07:32:13] <KevinX> Also, it's "Strawberry"
[07:32:16] <ThePendulum> it seems to me something earlier down the line is changing the order, or not capable of producing a reliable order
[07:32:48] <o|||||o> KevinX, that was a joke because this is a dev environment, a Scrubs reference
[07:33:06] <ThePendulum> run it a few times and see if it the order of pre-map arts changes at all
[07:33:18] <KevinX> ah, I've never seen it :D
[07:34:47] <o|||||o> this is the code displaying them(when i notice that the items are not in an order that i expect) https://paste.ee/p/NjOpp
[07:35:40] <KevinX> How about the part that has [arts, setArts]?
[07:36:11] <ThePendulum> I would indeed check what the input of ArtForm actually is, and whether that's in the right order
[07:36:22] <KevinX> oh actually you're GalleryCard needs the key
[07:36:27] <KevinX> your*
[07:36:53] <KevinX> <GalleryCard key={art.id}
[07:37:32] <o|||||o> art.id instead of index?
[07:37:39] <KevinX> always
[07:37:43] <KevinX> never use th eindex
[07:38:05] <ThePendulum> how does ArtForm tie into Gallery?
[07:38:16] <o|||||o> oh, i would have thought index was preferable. giving that a try now
[07:38:43] <ThePendulum> given the order of your elements changed randomly between two pasts I'm skeptical it'll solve the problem, but good to sort out anyway
[07:39:15] <o|||||o> KevinX, that took care of it

[21:13:01] <qswz> promises are held!

[21:13:14] <qswz> ok let me show what's I'd do

[21:13:32] <qswz> ljharb: I can start them when needed
[21:13:33] <ljharb> now, if you have TASKS - functions that return a promise - then it's trivial with reduce

[22:44:38] <banana_> idk about functional components though, youre saying if you had React experience already, but dont know how to make functional components, that learning how to make those would require that much of a learning curve
[22:44:42] <KevinX> well prettier will just abstract the noise
[22:44:50] <KevinX> or remove the noise
[22:45:09] <devslash> react is pretty cool...
[22:45:13] <stenno> hooks is the big part about learning curve
[22:45:20] <stenno> hooks are really complex
[22:45:31] <stenno> or rather, tehy are not that complex, but they are difficult to use correctly
[22:45:37] <stenno> like useeffect hook
[22:45:48] <banana_> stenno: in that scenario youre saying there's still a huge learning curve, but there's non-functional components that have hooks
[22:45:52] <KevinX> you only need to know that useRef changes do not cause a render, and put al side effects in useEffect
[22:46:04] <stenno> banana_: you don't need hooks in class components
[22:46:11] <banana_> honestly I dont have too much React experience either
[22:46:16] <stenno> KevinX: that... is super simplified

[22:46:17] <banana_> oh ok meh
[22:46:21] <KevinX> I wouldn't learn redux though
[22:46:33] <devslash> is it more common to only have the higher level components manage the states and the children are mostly stateless functional components that only render data
[22:46:35] <banana_> I thought class components had hooks as well.
[22:46:49] <stenno> why would you need hooks in class components?
[22:47:04] <systemfault> banana_: Class components are lifecycles methods
[22:47:08] <systemfault> *have
[22:47:12] <stenno> well you have 'lifecycle hooks', yes
[22:47:18] <devslash> isn't useState considered a hook ?
[22:47:21] <stenno> but those are not comparable with hooks
[22:47:31] <stenno> devslash: yes, usestate is a hook
[22:47:41] <stenno> a perfect example of a useless hook for a class component
[22:47:46] <stenno> as you just keep the state in the class instance
[22:48:00] <devslash> you're saying useState is useless ?
[22:48:09] <stenno> for class components, of course
[22:48:10] <stenno> lmao
[22:48:16] <banana_> idk specially for react class components, but I know using hooks in components is useful, but maybe the term "hook" has a different sub-sense in React terms
[22:48:17] <stenno> you just keep the state in the instance
[22:48:17] <devslash> why ?

[22:48:37] <KevinX> Maybe thats why React seems difficult
[22:48:57] <devslash> React has a much easier learning curve compare to Angular...
[22:48:59] <banana_> like if input data changed you might want to run some code to update internal component properties

[23:57:51] <lf94> stenno: you mean ?: right?
[23:57:56] <stenno> n> const foo = {}; const bar = foo?.bar?.baz ?? 23; bar
[23:57:57] <jellobot> (okay) 23
[23:57:59] <lf94> Ah
[23:58:01] <lf94> thta
[23:58:02] <z1haze> im still building new websites with jquery :( i dont have say-so to not
[23:58:11] <lf94> Didn't know it was called conditional chaining
[23:58:13] <stenno> ?: is ternary
[23:58:24] <systemfault> jQuery is still okay for small websites that needs a little bit of JS
[23:58:26] <z1haze> optional chaining
[23:58:26] <z1haze> ?
[23:58:28] <lf94> that.
[23:58:29] <z1haze> ?.
[23:58:31] <ljharb> optional chaining, yes
[23:58:35] <ljharb> "conditional chaining" isn't a thing
[23:58:35] <stenno> optional, yes
[23:58:44] <lf94> Knew it, my gut-brain knew it
[23:58:45] <z1haze> its not a colon, its a period
[23:58:49] <banana_> KevinX: being "good" is in the eye of the beholder, and "being good" only means anything, i.e. gives you status, when more people believe that about you.
[23:59:10] <lf94> ??= <- we're getting into haskell-level operator names now I see
[23:59:18] <lf94> >>>= when
[23:59:22] <banana_> also I think it matters where those "more people" are
[23:59:27] <banana_> in society
[23:59:39] <systemfault> lf94: Right now?
[23:59:43] <ljharb> lf94: it's just `??` plus `=`, like `+=` and all the others
[23:59:52] <lf94> I know I know :)
[23:59:54] <lf94> I'm just playing.
[23:59:56] <ljharb> n> let x = 1; x >>>= 2; x @ lf94
[23:59:57] <jellobot> lf94, 0
