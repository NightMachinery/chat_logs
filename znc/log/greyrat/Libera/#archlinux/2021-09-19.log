[02:12:37] <kevr> You don't even have to remove your Debian VM. Just create a new one for Arch.

[02:17:03] <kevr> your*
[02:17:30] <kevr> Certain pieces of hardware require certain things to even be viable for warranty.
[02:17:48] <kevr> Things like overheating can easily exclude several pieces of hardware from warranty viability.

[02:18:56] <kevr> I'm not sure how mac is about troubleshooting some machine that has Linux on it. You might want to verify that it's even okay to do that from Mac's perspective.
[02:19:17] <kevr> Otherwise, you might just end up with a $2k-$4k dead weight, and that wouldn't be too good.
[02:20:34] <kevr> If this was an older mac, I wouldn't be saying this. But, it's a mac from three years ago; that's quite a bit more expensive, and there's a reason that people pay those prices -- because of things like warranties and being able to get mac support on everything.

[06:17:28] <PrinceAMD> Is there a way to find what aur packages makes into core/community/extra on a monthly basis? 
[06:18:12] <PrinceAMD> - sometimes I want to know what new tool makes it into offical arch
[06:18:31] <kevr> PrinceAMD: It is not a scheduled thing. It happens when a TU or otherwise package maintainer in the official repos decides to adopt one of the AUR packages for some reason.
[06:19:04] <PrinceAMD> ok

[07:45:14] <kevr> what do dhcp clients have to do with systemd?
[07:45:44] <kevr> they don't depend on systemd, they depend on network interfaces.
[07:45:48] <Manouchehri> kevr: what does sshd have to do with systemd? (Answer: it has a systemd service/config already.)
[07:45:55] <kevr> I didn't ask that.
[07:46:14] <kevr> sshd is not a dhcp client.
[07:46:33] <Manouchehri> okay, let me rephrase
[07:46:42] <kevr> There are a bunch of dhcp clients around that work regardless of systemd being around or not.
[07:47:03] <Manouchehri> are there any dhcp clients that have a systemd service configuration/script already written?
[07:47:04] <kevr> One of the more popular ones are dhcpcd, dhclient
[07:47:17] <kevr> ah, i see.
[07:47:23] <kevr> Yeah, I believe dhcpcd comes with a systemd service
[07:47:29] <Manouchehri> thank you.

[12:50:50] <mpan> Assuming by “viruses” you mean malware: they seem to not be Windows specifically. The CVEs mention Apple products and AVG antivirus. Whatever they are is, however, irrelevant: if they were deployed on your computer, they would be in the past, so you would already be infected. If you are not, there are nothing to worry about. Likely you have simply visited websites that spread them.

[13:21:43] <mq^v> pacman refers to files in /usr/lib/<package>... instead of /var/lib/<package>... on my computer. Renaming the files in /urs/lib/... won't have the same effect as the ones instructed on the link above?
[13:22:24] <sheep> you should probably use --overwrite for those files instead of renaming
[13:23:03] <mq^v> sheep: why is it often advised agains it though?
[13:23:31] <sheep> where is pacman referring to files in /usr/lib? Do you mean that you use /usr/lib/pacman instead of /var/lib/pacman?
[13:24:11] <mq^v> sheep: no, it's /usr/lib/package-name/...
[13:24:30] <sheep> which package is it?
[13:24:48] <mq^v> python-cryptography
[13:25:07] <sheep> if it's something that pacman needs to run then I would definitely use --overwrite instead of renaming, but pacman doesn't use this
[13:25:16] <sheep> you can just remove the files

[13:29:04] <mpan> Perhaps it would be wise to understand, how the files ended up there? Like… using a different package manager? Which, if still used, will later nuke/modify those files, breaking things?
[13:29:19] <sheep> probably using pip as root
[13:29:40] <mpan> Indeed
[13:29:41] <mq^v> this package was installed by pacman
[13:29:49] <mq^v> pretty sure
[13:29:56] <mpan> Then how comes pacman doesn’t know about it?
[13:30:03] <sheep> if these files came from pacman then you wouldn't get an error about conflicting files
[13:30:20] <sheep> unless you were using packages from outside of arch's repositories
[13:30:33] <mq^v> i once interrupted an system-update (Syc) and was having troubles with that package ever scince
[13:30:34] <mpan> Perhaps you did something weird after they were installed by pacman. But I believe that should be addressed: to avoid the mistake in the future.
[13:30:52] <sheep> interrupting an update could also cause this
[13:31:09] <mpan> Oh, that is an explanation. So, as sheep said, you can delete them. And do not interrupt mid-update. 
[13:31:16] <mpan> Unfortunately pacman is not atomic. :/

[18:43:27] <dostoyevsky2> What are actually hybrid gpus?  Is that when you draw with two gpus on the same screen?
[18:44:01] *** Joins: polve (~polve@twcitalia/polve)
[18:44:49] <deltasquared> dostoyevsky2: no, that'd be when you have just two technically, one integrated and the other discrete. they could in theory draw and present to the same output, but that's not a requirement to the term.
[18:45:31] <deltasquared> (two discrete cards would probably just be a multi-gpu setup; hybrid graphics usually explicitly means an efficiency gpu and a high power gpu that can theoretically be switched between)

[18:49:23] <deltasquared> also that in a hybrid setup usually the higher power card ideally would output via the lower powered one's video outputs, so that the high power gpu can go completely idle when not being used. though a few laptop makers have been known to screw that up.

[18:50:35] <dostoyevsky2> Well, I switched off the hybridgpu option in the bios and blacklisted the internal amdgpu and now I can run Xorg
[18:50:55] <dostoyevsky2> on the nvidia card...
[18:51:06] <dostoyevsky2> let's see if I can unblacklist the amdgpu
[18:51:13] <deltasquared> that result is somewhat counter intuitive, but I can't advise there.
[18:52:10] <deltasquared> all I can say is have a hunt in the archwiki about nvidia hybrid graphics and ask back here if there is something you don't understand. I have no doubt someone will be here that knows what they're on about for specific hardware combinations.
[18:52:56] <deltasquared> (my experience is limited to a ryzen apu + an rx580 as the discrete, which is a way simpler setup and didn't require any shenanigans, so I will be of limited help for anything else specific)
[18:55:21] <dostoyevsky2> yeah, so now I have both the modules for amdgpu and nvidia in the kernel and I have instructed Xorg to use nvidia and it's still working
[18:59:38] *** Joins: danisztls (~weechat@user/danisztls)
[18:59:55] <dostoyevsky2> deltasquared: I guess in the bios you have to set which gpu will be using the internal monitor and the default was the amdgpu, so Xorg with nvidia was always complaining that it couldn't find a monitor

[22:04:33] <CyberShadow> By itself git isn't designed to store binary blobs like this, in fact people have tried to solve this outside git for a long time using LFS etc. Same goes for large directory listings, that probably will lead to O(n^2) performance or worse in at least a few places

[23:15:36] <kulak> I am confused. Gnome wiki page says default is wayland, but using `loginctl show-session 3 -p Type` lists `x11`.
[23:16:02] <thrice> how did you start gnome ?
[23:16:11] <kulak> from gdm
[23:16:43] <thrice> there should be a (gear?) icon that lets you choose x11 or wayland, perhaps check there?
[23:16:59] <Namarrgon> frojnd: does it work on any other OS?
[23:17:36] <frojnd> Namarrgon: no idea have just this one
[23:18:41] <kulak> My `/usr/share/xsessions/gnome.desktop` file uses `Exec=/usr/bin/gnome-session` command which is the same as gnome-xorg.desktop's command.
[23:18:47] <frojnd> It's old laptop thinkpad x230 it should work out of the box?
[23:18:54] <Namarrgon> frojnd: does rfkill list it?
[23:19:31] <thrice> kulak: well, which is selected in GDM?
[23:19:57] <frojnd> Namarrgon: no, that's also weird
[23:20:11] <frojnd> It just shows phy0
[23:20:22] <frojnd> For wifi
[23:20:33] <kulak> that's what I am saying.  it does not matter what GDM lists if gnome.desktop and gnome-xorg.desktop have the same command to start Gnome.
[23:20:33] <frojnd> Maybe it's damaged hardware
