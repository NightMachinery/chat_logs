[02:11:02] <johnny> well i personally use subprojects via meson to handle that, but one could als do ~/yourprojectsdir/include or some other place local to your $HOME
[02:11:18] <johnny> rather than cluttering up your root

[02:29:39] <OnlineCop> I have a function which modifies an OUT value, then raises an exception if a size check fails. I wonder if I should instead save the values to a temp, and only replace them if there's no exception? https://wandbox.org/permlink/bqTWGKrvdK98eRMw
[02:30:12] *** Joins: AbleBacon (~AbleBacon@user/AbleBacon)
[02:30:28] <OnlineCop> Specifically, the 2nd try{}catch block is where it's being modified but an exception is raised.
[02:33:05] <OnlineCop> The OUT arrays are usually fairly large (many MB up to a few GB), so keeping both in memory at once isn't preferred, but might be necessary.
[02:41:36] <RandomReader> I'd say the entire interface design is problematic, because there's no actual out param at all here
[02:41:42] <Friithian> for those of you who have heard of my ugly neovim setup, it is time to rejoice for I have nuked it and redone it
[02:42:20] <RandomReader> getParam() is already doing the logical duplicate-and-maybe-replace, everything above it is just noise and doesn't serve a practical purpose
[02:42:24] <RandomReader> can you alter the interface?
[02:43:01] <OnlineCop> getParam() grabs values from various streams. It doesn't know/care about the size requirements.
[02:43:14] <OnlineCop> getParamOfSize() wraps that and then validates that a size is what was expected.
[02:43:25] <RandomReader> ideally the size check would occur *before* collection of the results, but if that isn't possible, then getParam should simply return a value
[02:43:37] <RandomReader> the out param is not serving any purpose
[02:44:32] *** Quits: sprout (~quassel@2a02:a467:ccd6:1:bc5b:dbe0:79e5:a909) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[02:44:32] <OnlineCop> getParam should return nothing if an invalid key is supplied. If a valid key is found, it will fill it with whatever value is in the collection at the time.
[02:45:02] <OnlineCop> We can't assume that an empty vector result is an invalid result: it could be a key that exists but is empty.
[02:48:36] <RandomReader> currently the data storage is double: "results" in getParam, plus the copy to "out"
[02:48:54] <RandomReader> you're proposing adding a third copy temporarily: this is just a poor interface
[02:49:10] <RandomReader> ideally, getParam directly returns its results: zero copies
[02:49:15] <OnlineCop> https://wandbox.org/permlink/Bji1hvkpdVUc54gg is what I'm thinking.
[02:49:51] <RandomReader> then, by chaining the returns, the original caller (e.g. main() in this case) can assign to an existing variable if that's what it wants to do, and that assignment naturally doesn't occur if there's an exception
[02:50:11] <OnlineCop> If the key doesn't exist, the caller's "out" values should not be modified, though.
[02:50:41] <RandomReader> which you naturally get by using returns
[02:51:04] <RandomReader> "out" params are unnatural, there are extremely few reasons to use one
[02:52:02] <RandomReader> if you don't want getParam() to signal failure with an exception, you could instead return an optional<vector>, or a std::variant<vector, error_code>, or a struct with as many values and flags as you need, or....
[02:52:22] <OnlineCop> If getParam() directly returns its results, is that the results of successfully matching 'key', or of unsuccessfully matching 'key'?
[02:52:41] <johnny> or something like a Result object
[02:52:46] <OnlineCop> You're proposing that getParam() return a tuple instead of using an out param?
[02:53:31] <RandomReader> sure, if that's the kind of interface you require
[02:54:15] <RandomReader> personally I'd just use an exception for a non-existent key, and if that's an expected flow, I'd alter the usage so that I check it up front
[02:54:38] <RandomReader> or make changes at a higher-level, where I e.g. iterate or discover keys ahead of time, so there needs to be no check

[05:37:20] <RandomReader> mike18 - if the derived doesn't have this concept, then it is not a base, and therefore it is not correct as a derived
[05:37:49] <RandomReader> the question you're asking means the design is fundamentally broken: either this derived should not exist, or the definition/meaning of the base must change
[05:37:53] <mike18> but it has some other things which are shared among those classes
[05:38:03] <RandomReader> "some" is incorrect
[05:38:24] <mike18> there are 2 varaibles which are shared across all classes
[05:39:30] *** Quits: PJBoy (~PJBoy@user/pjboy) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[05:39:45] <RandomReader> in order for this kind of thing to be practical, *every* derived must be indistinguishable from a base .. this concept has a name: Liskov Substitution Principle

[05:40:15] <RandomReader> this kind of base isn't just a convenient thing to share "some" code, it's part of every derived's identity
[05:40:45] <RandomReader> what you are describing is a situation where this derived doesn't match a base at all .. therefore one of them is simply "wrong"
[05:40:49] *** Quits: seninha (~seninha@user/seninha) (Remote host closed the connection)
[05:41:02] <mike18> at all is not correct?
[05:41:14] *** Joins: PJBoy (~PJBoy@user/pjboy)
[05:41:14] <RandomReader> so, take a step back, look at the concepts you want to express, and find a better organization
[05:41:35] <RandomReader> maybe there should be no inheritance at all, maybe the code in base should just be a member of each derived
[05:41:46] <RandomReader> maybe there should be multiple "bases" for different parts of functionality
[05:42:02] <mike18> multiple base could make more sense
[05:42:08] <RandomReader> maybe all these deriveds aren't actually like each other and shouldn't try to share so much
[05:42:16] <RandomReader> that kind of thing
[05:43:50] <mike18> how can you store 2 base in 1 vector>
[05:43:53] <mike18> ?
[05:44:10] <RandomReader> this talks about it more, if it's useful: https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/proper-inheritance
[05:44:28] <RandomReader> you can't
[05:44:46] <RandomReader> (and you wouldn't be storing base objects anyway, only pointers)
[05:44:58] <mike18> yeah but the type of vector....
[05:45:01] <RandomReader> but this goes back to what I meant by multiple bases: each base represents something *different*
[05:45:04] <mike18> needs to be one only
[05:45:32] <RandomReader> if you have 3 Derived, and only 2 of them use IDs, then the base that handles IDs will not be common to all of them
[05:45:51] <RandomReader> why would you want to store that anyway? it's the other base that would matter, the one that is common to all 3 of them
[05:46:09] <mike18> so 2 vector?
[05:46:14] <RandomReader> if it's not common, then we're back to one of the other points I made: these Deriveds are not like each other and don't belong together in the first place
[05:46:38] <RandomReader> sure
[05:47:34] <RandomReader> it might help to think of your bases like interfaces, in which case having a collection (vector) for each interface is natural
[05:48:12] <RandomReader> just like one collection for names, one collection for invoices, etc .. logical organization, they're not related to each other
[05:48:15] <mike18> or have some sort of adapter as base
[05:48:39] <RandomReader> that still sounds like you're trying really hard to make things the same, when they're not the same
[05:48:41] <RandomReader> why?
[05:48:57] <RandomReader> what possible benefit will come from treating them the same, when they actually behave differently?

[06:58:14] <very_sneaky> Friithian: interesting. what does it provide over ycm?
[07:00:13] <Friithian> ycm is just more complex to setup and install, adding more linters is easy (a lot of languages people have already made a coc-whatever) for coc
[07:02:21] <Friithian> like, installing coc is just adding another plug, ycm there's a process to it
[07:02:28] <very_sneaky> right, so it's just about getting things working?
[07:02:52] <very_sneaky> i've just done some googling and people are talking about "quality of completion", which doesn't make any sense to me because both use clangd in the backend
[07:03:16] <Friithian> I've had no issue with coc, and with the versitility and ease of use it offers
[07:03:44] <very_sneaky> the reason i originally chose ycm was because there's a conan integration for it, so it makes it easy to lint code when libs are stored in a local cache rather than project directory
[07:04:49] <Friithian> well, I don't use conan :P
[07:05:22] <very_sneaky> i wonder how hard it would be to develop a coc generator for conan
[07:05:55] <Friithian> it's all black magic to me *shrug*
[07:07:48] <Friithian> oh fuck off clangd I know I haven't used any private vars or made a constructor yet
[07:07:51] <very_sneaky> fwiw, what i've foundis that the main difference is that coc.nvim is essentially an extension manager, whereas ycm is a monolithic code completion/linting engine, so new LSPs have to be merged into the project as a whole rather than operating independantly/modularly
[07:08:20] <very_sneaky> whereas people can write their own coc extensions for different LSPs? i think
[07:08:23] <Friithian> with coc you can add essentially any LSP to it
[07:08:25] <Friithian> yup
[07:08:44] <very_sneaky> i like that idea, not sure if it buys me anything if everything i want is working though
[07:08:59] <Friithian> if what you have already works I don't see any reason to switch
[07:09:09] <Friithian> unless you're doing things in different langauges constantly
[07:09:30] <Friithian> which, due to uni, I am
[07:09:45] <very_sneaky> i guess i'm in the spot where i don't know what i don't know - maybe it's more effective/efficient at things like refactoring, or resolving includes across multiple TUs

[09:38:09] <johnny> generally X has been available to me so i never end up looking at the gsl version
[09:38:13] <very_sneaky> an example is that I've currently got a `MessageBroker` class, which is a singleton and owns a raw pointer to itself that it passes out when a `getInstance()` method is called. I'm currently getting `Returning a newly created resource of type 'MessageBroker *' or 'gsl::owner<>' from a function whose return type is not 'gsl::owner<>' [cppcoreguidelines-owning-memory]` - I've marked pointer
[09:38:15] <very_sneaky> ownership correctly, and I guess it's now (correctly) identifying that I'm passing that pointer around without ownership semantics. In this case I don't intend for the return from `getInstance()` to infer ownership semantics, and the core guidelines seem to indicate that passing a raw pointer around in this case is the correct way to do that
[09:38:51] <johnny> well if you think it's a false positive, then ignore it right?
[09:39:12] <very_sneaky> i'm wondering what the best approach to deal with this static analysis is - is it to silence the warning, or is there some way i can flag this as intended using gsl?
[09:39:39] <johnny> well i imagine if you used gsl then it would also get rid of the warning. you'd have to read about what gsl::owner does though

[09:41:26] <very_sneaky> and yeah, now it's saying "you're not returning an owning pointer despite this being an owned pointer - wat do"
[09:41:43] <johnny> kapil, that would depend on where you are and where you're working, and also the industry. junior C++ programmer in gaming is different than say working in finace

[09:48:03] <very_sneaky> johnny: i guess you're right, i should probably silence it. weird that it throws a warning for the recommended approach to non-ownership semantics - maybe it's just meant as a "double check that you're doing what you intend here"

[12:03:28] <RandomReader> very_sneaky - why can't you use a unique_ptr inside it?
[12:05:12] <very_sneaky> RandomReader: it's a good question - It's been a while since I implemented this and I don't remember the specific issues. maybe i was trying to do it with a shared_ptr before i understood ownership semantics
[12:05:20] <very_sneaky> I'll revisit the idea of a unique_ptr
[12:06:04] <RandomReader> assuming I follow correctly, the singleton is roughly like    T* ptr;  T* getInstance() { if (!ptr) ptr = new T(); return ptr; }
[12:06:32] <very_sneaky> basically
[12:06:41] <RandomReader> since you're returning that ptr, which is owning, it's going to complain .. so a question would be why ptr is not unique_ptr, in which case you can just return .get()
[12:06:57] <very_sneaky> yeah, i'd still want to return T* from getInstance
[12:07:10] <RandomReader> (side question would be why getInstance() returns a T*, since it seems like it could just return a T&)
[12:07:29] <RandomReader> I'd expect either to get rid of the warning
[12:07:56] <RandomReader> that one anyway, I don't currently use anything with clang so not sure what else it might complain about instead, but IIRC the defaults are reasonable

[12:15:43] <RandomReader> for your earlier question about GSL, it doesn't seem super popular in here .. I see a few use it occasionally, just not widespread
[12:16:20] <RandomReader> for owner<> specifically, that's intended as a temporary marker for old codebases that can't yet refactor to just use e.g. unique_ptr
[12:16:54] <RandomReader> so I wouldn't suggest adopting it for new work
[12:18:28] <RandomReader> (like if you have a few owners of a T, it takes time to figure out if they should be unique_ptr or shared_ptr, where to sprinkle std::move or change types or copy, etc .. and owner<> combined with the analyzer can help mark and map those out)

[15:40:01] <manuels> I am not interested in DI and testability, since it introduces tons of boilerplate in my concept.
[15:40:08] <ville> you'd usually pass in some sort of "app context" or whatever you call it to that function, so the plugin can do what it needs to do
[15:40:38] <manuels> ville it is the other way around. the inface I want to expose is in the main app, and plugins should be able to call the core app.
[15:41:00] <manuels> for stuff like restart, quit, show_frontend, show_settings etc
[15:41:06] <ville> that's the "app context". it's whatever you wish it to be
[15:41:56] <manuels> thats effectively DI
[15:42:06] <manuels> i want it to be global.
[15:42:26] <manuels> plugins have to be default constructible due to Qt requirements.
[15:43:10] <ville> you can always setup some global state in your "initialize this plugin"
[15:43:30] <manuels> client can write plugins in like 10 LOCs. Implementing DI requires a factory then and they would have to store the app context. this bloats plugin code like about x10

[15:45:13] <ville> say it's a table of pointer-to-functions
[15:45:53] <ville> on your application side you call whatever functions are in the table: funs[DO_X]();
[15:46:02] <manuels> like a simple struct with static functions?
[15:46:27] <ville> in your plugins "initialize this plugin" function you loaded from the dso you set funs[DO_X] = &this_plugins_implementation;
[15:47:10] <manuels> I think you misunderstand
[15:47:22] <ville> of course now any number of plugins could "compete" that they set the pointers. loading order starts to matter and so on
[15:47:25] <manuels> because it is not the plugin setting the function but the core app
[15:47:40] <ville> the plugin sets the pointer table
[15:47:58] <ville> the application uses the pointer table to call any functon that happens to be at specific index/slot
[15:47:59] <manuels> but the plugin has no information about anything at all
[15:48:32] <ville> you can pass in the context when you call: funs[X](context);
[15:49:05] <manuels> example: i have a function in the main.cpp "void ::openSettings();".  I wish the plugin to be able to call (not define) it.
[15:49:29] <ville> that's presumably non-member function?

[15:51:00] <manuels> it is a member functoin of a class App in the end. but I can make the instance a global and write free wrapper functions to be exposed to the global space.
[15:51:37] <manuels> the thing is it must be abstract or extern in some way, such that the linker does not complain about undefined symbols
[15:53:08] <ville> just pass in your application to the plugin as context whenever you call one of the functions you loaded from a plugin?
[15:53:45] <ville> sure it's bit heavy handed, you could device more intricate ways if it seems necessary
[15:56:55] <ville> in the end you may wisht to "event-fy" your application actions anyhoo, so you rather send events and stuff around, rather than call any functions directly.
[15:57:09] <manuels> The problem here is that the plugin object lives in an event loop. Control can come from inside the plugin e
[15:57:28] <manuels> e.g. Triggered by an event
[15:59:20] <manuels> This open settings is a bad example since it is conform to the eventify idea. Is like to keep it genral

[20:54:42] <very_sneaky> RandomReader: yeah cheers. I can see where gsl::owner<T> is useful, especially when you're dealing with raw pointers that don't have ownership semantics. It seems like that's the case in my codebase at the moment so I've added it in, but yeah I've just raised an issue to evaluate whether it can be converted to a unique_ptr to remove the need to touch gsl
[20:55:37] <very_sneaky> PJBoy: says you - i release all my libraries with debug info ;)
[20:56:00] <PJBoy> you can alleviate the need for gsl by implementing owner<T> yourself
[20:56:59] <PJBoy> `template <typename T> using owner = T;`
[20:57:11] <PJBoy> I like how the clang-tidy docs manage to get that definition wrong
[20:57:15] <PJBoy> https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines-owning-memory.html
[20:57:19] <very_sneaky> yeah, i did see that it was a trivial implementation. Something like `{ namespace gsl { template <typename T> owner = T } }`
[20:57:21] <very_sneaky> yeah, that
[20:57:56] <very_sneaky> it was trivial to import it with conan though, so no worries
[20:58:52] <very_sneaky> I am noticing that clang 13 seems to have issues building gtest/1.10.0 though ~.~
