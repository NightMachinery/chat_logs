[00:06:07] <blau> I know the feeling
[00:08:00] <dimdima> what about you?
[00:08:44] <blau> I'm alright
[00:08:55] <blau> doing some career training with my post-secondary today
[00:10:23] <dimdima> what's a post secondary?
[00:10:38] <blau> university/college/trades school
[00:10:47] <dimdima> ahh cool
[00:10:53] <dimdima> what sort of career training
[00:10:56] <blau> primary = elementary school.  secondary = high school.
[00:11:00] <blau> it's a career workshop
[00:11:07] <blau> resumes, interview tips, that sort of thing
[00:11:40] <blau> networking too
[00:12:26] <blau> how to sell yourself.  it's a bit corporate-kool-aidy for my own tastes, but it's what companies look for.  they want you to suck up a little.
[00:13:41] <blau> why are you experiencing existential dread?

[17:47:28] <ngoldbaum> also makes it easier to get 100% test coverage if every public function has a docstring with one or more examples
[17:48:14] <dimdima> sorry i haven't used python in a while, realize i could just look this up, but: what if the function isn't pure? does this work on classes?

[21:04:04] <iDrougge> Xe: To clarify, I was poking fun at those who claim that IRC is a worthwhile alternative.

[21:18:05] <technomancy> I love how they ruined slash commands in slack
[21:18:48] <technomancy> it's like some exec saw someone using slash commands and completely missed the point and thought it needed to get turned into a "UI experience"
[21:19:23] <companion_cube> :D true
[21:19:30] <iDrougge> How?
[21:19:58] <companion_cube> iDrougge: clearly slack doesn't care about devs experience
[21:20:17] <companion_cube> otherwise there'd be a simple way of killing their idiotic wysiwyg markdown editor
[21:20:18] <iDrougge> They like to piss in their users' face, regardless of category.
[21:20:28] <revilaika> Slack looks more like something made for a corporate env, like teams
[21:20:50] <iDrougge> As if corporate users don't deserve good software.
[21:20:52] <technomancy> iDrougge: instead of letting you type /foo or whatever now typing / opens up a little bubble thing which loads really slowly
[21:20:57] <companion_cube> :D
[21:21:04] <companion_cube> it loads ok on their big machines I'm sure
[21:21:16] <iDrougge> It's instantaneous on my big machine.
[21:21:24] <companion_cube> the web client is slow, but still beats using a fucking electron app
[21:21:57] <iDrougge> That's what I meant by pissing in their users' face.
[21:22:12] <technomancy> I'm trying to think if there has been a single change to slack since I started using it that has improved things noticeably
[21:22:16] <revilaika> iDrougge: yes but the user experience doesn't matter as much. You have to use it anyways, doesn't matter how buggy it is and the user retention is a lot higher because of it

[21:24:28] <iDrougge> Do you hate Slack's WYSIWYG markdown editor? Try Microsoft's editor which sometimes supports markdown by chance.

[21:29:29] <iDrougge> It's also interesting that Microsoft has built both VS Code, which is considered the only useful Electron app, and Teams, which is some kind of anti-advertisement for Electron.
[21:29:34] <varjag> wow… so thought out
[21:30:00] <varjag> teams works fine i dunno what are you on about
[21:30:09] <revilaika> yes, you have some templates and you can add your own

[21:31:06] <lkhrs> the weird threading/topic thing they had was pretty awful, so my org just made one huge chat room
[21:31:40] <technomancy> it's funny because "screensharing works" is actually just a normal webrtc feature that you kind of have to go out of your way to fuck up nowadays

[21:33:26] <revilaika> Google+ was nice until they tried to make it popular
[21:33:31] <iDrougge> Oh, and Teams hijacks your media keys for no good reason, so if you pause your music to enter a Teams call, and press play after hanging up to resume your music, you instead call up again.
[21:33:58] <lkhrs> oh yeah, that's a chromium "feature"
[21:34:24] <iDrougge> Haha. Microsoft and Google, what would we do without them?
[21:34:52] <revilaika> Oh and you can't use your random bluetooth headphones, the mic never works. There are a handfull of them that were tested and certified by microsoft
[21:35:17] <lkhrs> the issue I had with microphones ended up being a Windows permission issue
[21:36:03] <lkhrs> Windows has some sort of mic permission system that only blocks random apps and lets others through no problem, so I'm like what's the point

[21:56:20] <technomancy> but I guess I've never heard of XMPP being used for anything but 1:1 chats so maybe that's why
[21:56:24] <rhn> no, if I wanted to use immature clients I'd use Matrix :D
[21:56:29] <bkero> The XMPP spec itself is old, and the implementations are mature, however modern clients aren't nearly as old or mature, and many have different XEP compatibility.
[21:56:49] <rhn> "modern" is such a weird concept

[23:24:09] <manicennui> I also don't you know you can see them adding ads and shit to the OS and not be at least a little distrustful.
[23:24:12] <daegalus> I was there during the 90s and early 2000s on windows. Im aware, but I also know things change, and I dont hold grudges. maybe some day I will like Apple again, but I know i will re-evaluate that when it happens.

[23:26:39] <manicennui> daegalus: Phones are a lost cause.
[23:27:08] <manicennui> It's also pretty trivial to avoid ads on iOS.
[23:27:24] <manicennui> It's not as if they have added ads to the lock screen or something (yet).
[23:27:56] <lkhrs> manicennui: they have, it's unwarranted push notifications from the App Store + Apple TV
[23:27:57] <geoffwozniak> I use Win10 Pro and ads aren't an issue. I expect if I used Home I'd be less enthused
[23:28:02] <daegalus> I think Anti-ads is a lost cause, unless you find a different way for companies to monetize that competes with Free + Ads. Im also anti-ads, but I know we cant get away from it. What I am pushing for is less invasive ads, more text ads, less ad-targetting based on my data. But I am no longer pushing for no ads.
[23:28:05] <manicennui> lkhrs: I've never seen it.

[23:29:25] <manicennui> lkhrs: I think they might have removed it.
[23:29:35] <lkhrs> App Store sends me Arcade ads once in a while
[23:30:47] <lkhrs> still less ads/unwanted notifications than when I was on Android, I will say that
[23:31:13] <daegalus> Linux is the solution, the problem is Linux Desktop is a fiery mess of half working window managers, and desktop environments. the current Wayland vs X11 wars, and compatibility issues, while improving, is still an issue. DEs are also a mess. with Gnome 40 and others. People wont adopt it mainstream if Linux desktop doesnt converge a bit and gets better.
[23:31:20] <manicennui> I have both an iPhone and a Pixel phone.

[23:39:58] <daegalus> Oh I agree 99% of the target audience will not even know what Linux is
[23:40:26] <daegalus> But it seems Valve is deep on Proton and Linux gaming. So we will see
[23:40:50] <manicennui> I'm not doubting their commitment to Linux.
[23:41:07] <manicennui> I'm doubting their commitment to hardware and the Deck as a platform for gaming.
[23:41:12] <geoffwozniak> daegalus: I only partly agree that Linux is the solution. As you mentioned earlier, the economics of the Internet (monetize on ads) is core problem. If Linux desktops were attractive to people, there would be ads there. (I'm not convinced that the open source world can make a decent, integrated desktop environment that appeals to many people.)
[23:41:29] <c355e3b> Elemenatry OS gets somewhat close
[23:41:41] <manicennui> I don't even think it's the desktop
[23:41:50] <manicennui> Gnome is fine for most users.
[23:42:10] <manicennui> It is having to deal with everything else, including the apps people want to run and specific hardware issues like power management.
[23:42:22] <riv> most users: How do I get thumbnails when choosing a picture to upload?
[23:42:25] <manicennui> And even basic shit like making trackpads not suck requiring obscure configuration.
[23:42:50] <daegalus> fair point. We can only see. they seem to try stuff, and if it doesnt work, they cancel it. But in this case the game platform in Steam. So even if you go all in on steam games, you can still play them on PC and Mac.
[23:43:32] <geoffwozniak> manicennui: I'm kind of lumping that into the desktop environment for the sake of simplicity
[23:43:37] <manicennui> daegalus: Not questioning that, or even trying to discourage anyone from being a Deck, but you should go into it realizing it will probably be discontinued.
[23:43:44] <rhn> lack of a generally appealing environment comes from lack of money and lack of integrated hardware
[23:44:03] <lkhrs> manicennui: based on valve's hardware history, I agree
[23:44:18] <meff[m]> Huh an ad-supported DE for Linux. That would be funny.
[23:44:26] <lkhrs> it was funny
[23:44:30] <rhn> IBM is taking care of the money, but when that money is poured into OEM laptops, then the open source world will create good out of the box experiences
[23:44:48] <manicennui> And being discontinued doesn't mean that you won't be able to use it, but if you want to keep some form of up to date OS on it, you will probably need to deal with it yourself at some point.
[23:44:48] <meff[m]> Maybe it would actually come up with an experience that people use, and then they'd be rebuffed by ads.
[23:45:19] <lkhrs> Ubuntu did do ads
[23:45:22] <manicennui> I'm sure Ubuntu would love to do that, but desktop OSes are becoming less and less relevant outside of the corporate world.
[23:45:29] <meff[m]> oh right I had forgotten about that
[23:45:52] * Teckla uses, and has no problems with, Ubuntu MATE.
[23:46:18] <meff[m]> Did they run the ads on MATE? I don't remember which DE or whatever
[23:46:28] <manicennui> I have a Dell XPS with Ubuntu. I haven't seen the crap that used to exist.
[23:46:33] <Teckla> I've never seen any.  I think MATE is a fork of GNOME 2.

[23:47:32] * Teckla never liked Unity.
[23:47:51] <manicennui> The biggest problems I have is that it still blows for power management, trackpads, etc.
[23:48:10] * Teckla is not a huge fan of GNOME 3 either... but with enough elbow grease, you can usually find some hidden/low-level knobs and levers to get it to behave nice.
[23:48:11] <manicennui> Even with official Dell drivers, etc.

[23:48:27] <feoh> I actually do think the desktop is a big part of it, and it's all about simple funding in the form of engineer hours and economies of scale
[23:48:31] <manicennui> On desktop machines I actually think Gnome 3 is pretty nice.
[23:48:38] <manicennui> It is way more responsive than Windows.

[23:48:45] <feoh> Gnome has been flat busted for visually impaired people who need zoom since Ubuntu 19.10
[23:48:54] <manicennui> TF2 even runs better in Linux on my desktop machine than in Windows.
[23:49:06] <Teckla> For me, regarding GNOME 3, the straw that broke the camel's back was when they removed the ability to set the desktop wallpaper to a solid color.  There are a few ways to work around that, and I did, but at that point, I knew the GNOME devs were moving in a direction that just wasn't compatible with me.
[23:49:06] <manicennui> Probably because it was created before GPUs were the focus.
[23:49:11] <revilaika> System76 is somewhat popular and their distro, PopOS, is what you would expect from a $1000 laptop. Most of the popular hardware is well supported and the DE are nice if you like that sort of workflow, but it is not going to get more popular because most people aren't using PCs nowadays, so there is no point in making a dekstop for the average joe
[23:49:20] <feoh> The bug just sits there, languishing, because the code base is complex enough that there are only 2-3 people on the planet who can actually fix it and they don't have time
[23:49:34] <c355e3b> and that's generally the problem with large systems

[23:50:48] <c355e3b> Which I think is kinda the issue with most modern software
[23:50:53] <manicennui> I don't think it is possible to fix Linux on the desktop, even with a fuckton of money.

[23:55:18] <manicennui> revilaika: Except when they also rely on shared configs somewhere.
[23:55:26] <lkhrs> on top of that, iOS has a magnifier
[23:55:35] <revilaika> then they are in /etc or /usr/share
[23:55:35] <rhn> wait, zoom is not magnifier?
