[13:28:54] <nakedeyes> hey y'all. i'm messing with internal load balancers, i want to route all ports of a loadbalancer (service as k8s object type) to a matching pod, but for this services require port definitions
[13:29:49] <nakedeyes> it was surprising how difficult it is to get huge amount of ports exposed.
[13:30:48] <shad> nakedeyes: why do you need that many ports ?
[13:30:57] <nakedeyes> ftp passive ports
[13:31:29] <shad> damn
[13:32:16] <shad> you trying to run a FTP inside kubernetes ? The generational gap, bringing the new kids to play with the old people ?
[13:32:42] <nakedeyes> yes
[13:33:03] <nakedeyes> and there is sftpgo
[13:33:13] <shad> y'know, the kids would rather play with people their age, like S3 ?
[13:33:42] <nakedeyes> embedded devices are irreplaceble parts of the system unfortunately :(
[13:34:22] <nakedeyes> and them using ftp.. causing some sleepless nights
[13:46:07] *** Quits: dme86 (~dan@user/dan86) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[13:49:58] <nakedeyes> i just feel like it is a trivial problem and i dont know the solution. i have an ip i want all the the ports
[13:52:21] <shad> how many ports do you want to expose ?

[14:45:13] <shad> nakedeyes: maybe you can trick yourself with helm go templating in a loop ?
[14:46:00] <shad> template a loop in the service definition should do the trick, probably
[14:46:22] <nakedeyes> i have go code generating ports, it is not about that part, but cloud providers define limits. in azure it is 300 rule on a nic.
[14:47:02] <shad> welp
[14:47:40] <shad> maybe not very k8s way, but perhaps you should have your SFTP running outside of kubernetes but writing to a mounted volume that's also mounted in your cluster
[14:48:16] <shad> less sexy tho
[14:48:39] <nakedeyes> yes i consider moving this fracture off-cluster, monitoring, scaling all that benefits are lost then :( 
[14:51:45] <shad> damn technical debt
