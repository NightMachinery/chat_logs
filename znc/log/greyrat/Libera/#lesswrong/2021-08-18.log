[00:07:52] <gwern> as described it makes more sense if someone inside delta took a single column of mileages and then fabricated a second column with `runif` to feed to ariely... why? god knows, could be as dumb as "I'll do ariely a favor by giving him data but oh, it's too much work to get the real followups /Excel!'

Despite an investment of billions of dollars — construction started in 1997 and operations began in 2009 — the apparatus initially generated hardly any fusion at all. In 2014, Livermore scientists finally
[00:40:44] <feepbot> reported success, but the energy produced then was minuscule — the equivalent of what a 60-watt light bulb consumes in five minutes. On Aug. 8, the burst of energy was much greater — 70 percent as much as the energy of laser light hitting the hydrogen target. That is still a losing proposition as an energy source, consuming more power than it produces. But scientists are
[00:40:44] <feepbot> confident that further jumps in energy output were possible with fine-tuning of the experiment.' https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/17/science/lasers-fusion-power-watts-earth.html /sigh

[01:51:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Reading the latest SSC post ... gotta admit I just do not believe that Benezet experiment thing
[01:51:41] <two2thehead> someone needs to figure out what if any affects there are on productivity, when Rich Text Format copy-and-paste was enabled, vs just plaintext copy-and-paste
[01:51:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> "In the Benezet experiment, a school district taught no math at all before 6th grade (around age 10-11). Then in sixth grade, they started teaching math, and by the end of the year the students were just as good at math as traditionally-educated children with five years of preceding math education. I interpret this to mean that a lot of education involves cramming things into the heads of very young students who would be able
[01:51:54] <Obormot\Arcturus>  to learn it very quickly anyway when they were older. Certainly it doesn’t seem like a child missing math class in grades 1-5 should have much of a long-term effect." ... just... I don't believe it
[01:53:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> "[Benezet] also asked the teachers to give their pupils some practice in measuring and counting things, to assure that they would have some practical experience with numbers." ... there it is
[01:54:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> So the normal classes were taught nothing but arithmetic (arithmetic!! not algebra, not geometry, just *arithmetic*!) by rote for FIVE FUCKING YEARS, and the experimental classes were taught ... measuring and counting things and practical experience with numbers
[01:55:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then in the *sixth* year, they both learned ... more fucking arithmetic
[01:55:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> And they both ended up knowing the same amount of arithmetic
[01:55:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gee whiz gosh wow
[01:56:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Meanwhile, I learned algebra in first grade, and in sixth grade I was doing geometry, systems of equations, etc.
[01:57:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Could've been doing much more advanced shit but this was American school (first grade was in Russia), so, you know
[01:57:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> So yeah, this Benezet thing is bullshit, at least as Scott's using it

[01:58:43] <Robomot> When Less Is More: The Case for Teaching Less Math in School | Psychology Today (In an experiment, children who were taught less learned more.)
[01:59:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> So the author of this one explains everything I just said, THEN he goes on to point out that the math *teachers* in our schools are morons who themselves can't do math, and concludes from this that we should stop teaching math
[02:00:05] <gwern> since it seems unlikely we'll pull millions of Actually Competent TM math teachers out of our collective asses...
[02:00:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> You're not wrong, but that's not at all the reasoning that's given here
[02:02:15] <kuudes> maybe people there are not very intelligent?
[02:02:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Where?
[02:02:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> America? As a whole?
[02:03:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, we have a bell curve of IQ, same as everyone else... "the people are not very intelligent" doesn't explain anything
[02:03:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> The population mean is nothing surprising
[02:03:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, then there's this graph: https://mlsvc01-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/8a55645a001/58ccd4b4-be74-41a7-a220-d63a372dee5e.png

[02:04:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> So the *supposed* takeaway from this graph is, "look, the New Orleans students caught up, after Hurricane Katrina fucked up their shit!" (Katrina was 2005)
[02:04:57] <gwern> (the descriptions of the control children making errors are very much 'guessing the teacher's password' but nothing new there)
[02:05:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> And ok, cool, but how about explaining that massive drop in the Louisiana scores??
[02:05:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> What happened there?! And why!
[02:05:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Without knowing that, this graph is super suspect
[02:05:55] <gwern> the charter schools, one assumes
[02:06:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> What charter schools? What's actually the explanation?
[02:06:34] <gwern> (new orleans literally dissolved the entire public school system because it was such a disaster and chucked everyone into charter schools with a voucher, iirc)
[02:06:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, New Orleans did, but what about the rest of Louisiana?
[02:07:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm talking about the blue line on the graph
[02:07:01] <kuudes> bell curve of course indeed, but where is the mean compared to other places
[02:07:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also:
[02:07:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> "After the hurricane, New Orleans switched to a charter-school-based system and test scores went up, with New Orleans students generally outperforming their peers." - but Scott, that's NOT what the graph shows; it shows New Orleans students *under*performing their peers
[02:08:25] <gwern> dunno. I'd put more effort into interpreting it if it had error bars. I can only guess that it's probably not a year/exam norming issue because the new orleans time-series is much flatter
[02:09:02] <gwern> (ie if the 2012 ACT was just unfairly hard after overreacting to a too easy 2011, then you'd expect NO to drop too)

[02:19:33] <pompolic> without intending to start a category debate, would that imply that school faculty aren't adults?
[02:19:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Making them the responsibility of other adults is obviously ideal, in fact
[02:19:38] <pompolic> because i would believe that instantly
[02:19:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because then you have people other than yourself to blame for any problems
[02:19:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> In addition to being free of your kids for half the day
[02:19:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's win-win
[02:20:40] <kiboneu> when i have a kid i'll show them the way of the hacker, and there won't be schooling for that
[02:20:57] <pompolic> well well well if it isn't externalizing costs on others reducing my degrees of freedom
[02:21:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> "On the other hand, this one from Argentina has very robust effect sizes. Being exposed to ten days more Argentine teacher strike doesn’t just decrease test scores, doesn’t just hurt employment and earnings decades later, but even (if I’m understanding it correctly) causes intergenerational effects that decrease the school performance of the children of the students who underwent the teachers’ strike.
[02:21:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> I can’t find any specific problems with this study. It just seems extreme to me. We know from the absence data above that missing eighteen days of school doesn’t even decrease your score on that year’s reading test - but missing ten days means you’ll get a worse job as an adult and even rubs off on your children and your children’s children unto the n-th generation? Benezet just didn’t teach math at all for five
[02:21:24] <Obormot\Arcturus>  years and everyone did fine, but if you miss even ten days of your math class you’ll never recover?
[02:21:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> (also, compare the second-generation effects of experiencing a 10 day long teacher strike vs. experiencing the Holocaust - the results might surprise you!)"
[02:22:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Would it be uncouth to point out the demographics of the subjects of these two respective studies
[02:22:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Probably, right

Thus, there appears to be a striking attitude-behavior gap here:
[02:48:43] <feepbot> Whereas people’s lay theories of exchange seem to produce strong intuitions that consumers are often made worse off by their purchases, these attitudes do not seem to manifest (in most cases, fortunately) in their actions.' lol

[03:11:18] <pompolic> i would be happier if i did that, i think
[03:11:45] <gwern> nshepperd: well, that's true, that's their main interpretation: essentially that we trivialize other people and regard them as mindless automatons *tricked* by Big Buying. if we're forced to think about how they may be people even more intelligent and better informed and with different preferences, we don't act so anti-market. so presumably we have similar theory of mind problems: we don't...
[03:11:51] <gwern> ...remember how good the apple tasted compared to 'starving to death'
[03:12:15] <pompolic> lack of principle of charity strikes again
[03:12:21] <gwern> 'past-me was a sucker, I am a rational optimizer, future-me will be a sucker'
[03:12:44] <pompolic> that's strange, i do the exact opposite
[03:12:55] <saturn2> i still think other people are mindless automatons tricked by big buying
[03:12:56] <pompolic> i'm an idiot in realtime, and approximate a rational optimizer otherwise
[03:14:57] <saturn2> advertising is constantly telling everyone else you're a loser if you don't buy, so you have a choice between buying and being perceived as a loser. this is indeed a zero-sum wealth transfer to the advertisers
[03:16:42] <pompolic> i think modeling adtech as an adversarial toolkit vs the human psyche tracks
[03:17:07] <nshepperd> can't argue with that logic
[03:18:02] <pompolic> look what they have to do to approximate the fraction of our power.png
[03:21:20] <pompolic> i also think that actually becoming immune to advertising starts somewhere with recognizing moment-to-moment idiocy and appropriately adjusting downwards the weight of transient "i want that" feelings or something
[03:23:36] <nshepperd> and installing adblock
[03:23:47] <pompolic> that too
[03:24:18] <pompolic> i've had ideas about adblock irl
[03:24:30] <pompolic> looking at advances in computer vision every so often
[03:24:58] <pompolic> ofc blacklisting is a fool's errand
[03:25:06] <pompolic> so it's a hell of a problem space
[03:26:01] <gwern> that's why you use NNs. to bootstrap your original blacklist into a generic ad-detector
[03:26:21] <pompolic> i really want to hate NNs
[03:26:38] <gwern> I think it's totally doable now already. prototype it on some random city-walking-footage, I'm sure there's tons of it on youtube etc
[03:27:07] <gwern> no need to actually make it run in realtime on a google glass or a smartphone until shown PoC of realtime segmentation & editing
[03:28:02] <pompolic> i feel like something is still missing but that gets into territory i actually want to prototype so I'm holding my tongue
[03:28:20] <pompolic> for now
[03:29:08] <gwern> 'something'? the pixel segmenting either works or doesn't. you can see how well yolov3 already works in bounding boxes for random stuff. you just take a frame, get segmentation, and overlay a black pixel on each advertising-classified pixel
[03:30:29] <pompolic> i'm not skeptical of that working
[03:30:42] <pompolic> i think i practically gave it away anyway
[03:30:49] <pompolic> i think the issue is with blacklisting
[03:31:13] <pompolic> but i think it would be epistemically irresponsible to speculate more without proof of concept

[04:49:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Responding more directly to the point of the graph: the population changes caused by Katrina are likely responsible for a lot of the increase. From 2000-2010 the population of the city itself (coterminous with the Orleans Parish school district) shrank by 140,000, mostly due to Katrina. The drop of the African-American population was 120,000 of that. I'm not sure if year-over-year ACT scores by race are available for New
[04:49:18] <Obormot\Arcturus>  Orleans public schools, but I'm guessing that if you control for race, it wasn't as much of an improvement as it seems. I also suspect that among black New Orleanians, the ones who didn't come back were much more likely to be poor and have kids who performed poorly in school. If you were a homeowner during Katrina, flood insurance payments and Road Home money helped. If you were a renter, your place may very well have been

[05:01:47] <Betawolf> Well, it's not hard to guess who the chick with the dragons is.
[05:02:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, sure, but ... does that *really* evoke Daenerys to you?
[05:02:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> The whole style is bizarre for ASoIaF
[05:02:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Meanwhile, back to the latest ACX;
[05:03:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> "As a teacher, I agree with this. Perhaps I'm burned out and cynical, but it seems to me that school is mostly a holding pen for children while parents go to work. Certainly if there was one theme from how parents reacted to covid, online schooling, and everything else, it was that the primary tension came from how disruptive it was to the parents' lives to have no place to send the kids during the day." ... someone else
[05:03:09] <Obormot\Arcturus>  notices, eh
[05:04:13] <adiabatic> yeah, it's kind of shocking how _useful_ that is
[05:04:25] <adiabatic> doubly so if you're a teacher yourself
[05:04:47] <Betawolf> I think I'm not a fan of the coloured one, but the arya one is okay. I mean, it's not front-page stuff, but I guess that's not where it's intended for either.

[05:14:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I was unschooled until I was 15, I'm pursuing a PhD now. Catching up on the basics wasn't easy but only took a few months. There are still a bunch of random general knowledge things I don't know, but at most it's caused a moment of embarrassment in social situations (e.g., when I genuinely thought dinosaurs were mythical creatures)." ... yeah. Well, the dinosaurs thing isn't *that* bad (actually I think it's pretty bad, but
[05:14:32] <Obormot\Arcturus>  it could be worse) ... but what else doesn't she know? Could be huge gaps in her knowledge of the world

[05:16:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway... you know I hate to use the word, but a lot of these pro-homeschooling commenters are showing just a massive amount of privilege
[05:17:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> e.g. how exactly was my mother supposed to homeschool me while working two jobs to pay the rent
[05:18:30] <saturn2> would she have needed to work two jobs if the government had given her the money it spent on your schools?
[05:18:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right? I mean, this is the scenario that I feel homeschooling advocates don't address at all: say you got an immigrant family, or, worse, a single parent, so are we expecting them to (a) work to support themselves+kid, while *also* teaching the kid whatever constitutes the requisite curriculum, while *also* learning it themselves?
[05:18:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Probably only one job in that case, but then, that's not the proposal
[05:19:06] <Betawolf> I mean, yeah, but that's hardly veiled, is it? Nobody sane says 'yes, everyone should be homeschooled', it's just that people rich enough not to have to work get to make their child even more insufferably overachieving than they are.
[05:19:35] <saturn2> reversal test, what if she needed to pay the rent plus pay full price for childcare
[05:19:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: You're saying, basically, "if we abolish schools and hand people the money, a la Scott's proposal, <good results>". Ok, sure. But I'm talking about the people who come into these comment threads and go "you should homeschool your kid"
[05:19:53] <saturn2> oh okay
[05:20:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Betawolf: It's pretty veiled! Read some of these comments!
[05:22:03] <saturn2> people online are being clueless and annoying, must be a day ending in y
[05:22:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Those are the worst days tbh
[05:23:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> But anyway, it's not just that it's random people - this sort of view is popular among the "rationalist" or "rationalist adjacent" set
[05:23:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe more of them than I thought come from rich families
[05:24:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> And what I said above, that's not even taking magnet schools into account!
[05:24:09] <saturn2> i always thought most of them did
[05:24:11] <Betawolf> I think poor people would also like to be clever and wealthy enough to teach their own kids.
[05:25:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> What would my mother have had to do to (a) work two jobs, while (b) learning all the shit she'd need to teach me stuff, and (c) teaching me stuff, with that resulting in (d) an education comparable to what I got from, specifically, the schools I went to?
[05:25:31] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: a lot of these people were like, uh, the Shtetl-Optimized guy and had absolutely horrible experiences in normal school and so they're big huge fans of doing whatever possible to spare their kids the random brutality that happens in normal schools
[05:25:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is that, literally, even humanly possible??
[05:25:59] <adiabatic> I went to a nice high school, so no worries on that front. You went to a nice high school, so no worries on that front.
[05:26:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Yeah, yeah, but *how*? Do they stop to think about that? Literally *how* is that to be accomplished by non-rich people?
[05:26:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Yeah? I guess that didn't occur to me... typical family history fallacy or something
[05:26:33] <adiabatic> I don't think they've solved that for single parents yet
[05:26:38] <saturn2> most people would have to start by moving to NYC...
[05:29:13] <Betawolf> Obormot\Arcturus: step 1 is become rich. If you don't manage that then whatever, try again next generation.
[05:29:35] <adiabatic> I mean, I'm weakly in favor of homeschooling if you can hack it and want to, but hey, this is totally an unsolved problem for dumb/single/poor parents
[05:29:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> "You wrote: "I think some of these points are stronger for poor/minority/at-risk kids, and weaker for comfortable/Eurasian/not-at-risk kids."
[05:29:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> For the at risk kids, school closing is a disaster. Imagine a kid living in a homeless shelter or a kid whose parents are terrible role models or, worse, abusive, or a kid who doesn't have enough to eat. For those kids, school may be their only oasis of normalcy. Without school, they will at minimum suffer and might permanently lose a chance at a decent life. This has little to do with test scores and everything to do with
[05:29:38] <Obormot\Arcturus>  socialization and having adults in their lives who care. " ... I feel like this exposes some much deeper problems
[05:30:22] <Betawolf> If I were to have kids I'd seriously consider homeschooling them, the major drawback I can see (aside from that kids are annoying) is socialising them to not be the weirdo in every room would be pretty hard.  
[05:30:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Hear, hear. I had serious medical problems in grade 5, needed a major surgery in grade 6, and was told I'd have to miss a year. My parents tried homeschooling, rigorously followed a bunch of curricula, and discovered I could finish all the assigned coursework in 2 hours/day and spend the rest of the time reading my favorite books. We were so unimpressed by the time wasted in "regular school" that we kept homeschooling another
[05:30:26] <Obormot\Arcturus>  2 years. I now have a PhD, but those were among the best days of my life."
[05:30:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> ">     I could finish all the assigned coursework in 2 hours/day
[05:30:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yep. This is the origin story of basically every homeschooler."
[05:30:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Boy was this ever *not* true for me
[05:30:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2 hours a day! My god
[05:32:22] <adiabatic> yeah, one can go _much_ faster when the teacher isn't focused on classroom management (getting the kdis to behave)
[05:32:34] <saturn2> 2 hours seems like a lot
[05:33:02] <adiabatic> at your school there probably wasn't much classroom management to be done because the kids are mostly well behaved even if there are a lot of them per class
[05:37:20] <Betawolf> A lot of secondary school was basically the teacher giving busywork and everyone goofing off while doing the minimum. This was in the top set, the classes in the lower four were a lot worse.
[05:38:56] <Betawolf> Our geography teacher semi-regularly just played old episodes of the Simpsons he had on video.
[05:43:56] <feepbot> <gwern> https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.13290.pdf#page=7 ohhh, *now* I get how cogview self-reranking works... it's not a backprop thing at all. to do 'image -> GPT text tokens', they literally just swap the order of text/image tokens in the training corpus, and do some finetuning. cogview is just smart enough that this doesn't totally wreck the model and it can update to a new
[05:43:56] <feepbot> image->text model without too much trouble
[05:47:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: 2 hours *seems* like a lot, but in reality... it is a lot
[05:47:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: But what I actually got was more like 4-6 hours
[05:51:35] <adiabatic> 4–6 hours of homework per day?
[05:53:46] <saturn2> i assumed the homeschooling curricula didn't include busywork

[07:58:14] <gwern> (because he can't fly and prefers to stay put in canada, only occasionally taking trains or private planes, leading to various deals and path dependencies and here we are)
[07:59:46] <nshepperd2> weird
[08:00:08] <nshepperd2> did he lose his butt in a transporter accident
[08:01:01] <gwern> no. some sort of back condition which makes any bending agonizing or impossible
[08:01:33] <gwern> so he can take a train, because they let you stand the entire time; or he can take a private plane because they let you lay down on the floor and not be belted in
[08:02:00] <nshepperd2> ouch
[08:02:01] <gwern> (one googler who flew with him on a private google plane apparently commented they worried what would happen if there was an accident and geoff became a living missile)

[08:36:44] <feep> but that's effooort

[08:37:20] <PapuaHardyNet> lmao
[08:38:05] <PapuaHardyNet> oh hey, check this out
[08:38:19] <nshepperd2> i veto that idea
[08:39:15] <PapuaHardyNet> if you leave no silence in the chat, then feepbot won't post, which means gwern himself will have to post. all you need is a feepbot clone with a shorter silence threshold
[08:39:42] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd2: surely I'm not that terrible to listen to
[08:40:19] <ivan> it's been silent for 299 seconds
[08:40:34] <ivan> just repeat that
[08:41:54] <gwern> PapuaHardyNet: ah, but then that means there's always conversation going on... https://xkcd.com/810/
[08:41:55] <Robomot> xkcd: Constructive
[08:43:49] <PapuaHardyNet> reminds me of gurkenglas' thought experiments. what if you had a gpt-j chatbot trained on #lesswrong content and has access to RSS feeds to do regular gwernposting - that bot would probably be welcomed in the community
[08:44:14] <nshepperd2> we had one of those
[08:44:20] <PapuaHardyNet> oh no, what happened
[08:44:29] <gwern> well, not the rss feed part
[08:44:45] <PapuaHardyNet> then it is a far cry from a gwern replacement
[08:45:02] <nshepperd2> oh sure, it just made up gwernpastes from whole cloth
[08:45:51] <PapuaHardyNet> hahahah. I imagine training a text segmentation model to mimic gwernpastes would be an actual asset to the community though
[08:46:09] <gwern> the gpt-1.2b gwernpastes *were* pretty interesting, I thought
[08:46:15] <nshepperd2> it was very entertaining but incoherent
[08:46:49] <PapuaHardyNet> re segmentation: input is a set of RSS feeds, output is a gwernpaste for each entry in the feed
[08:47:02] <nshepperd2> are you talking about summarization?
[08:47:42] <PapuaHardyNet> no, quotation. You know how CV models create a sort of square to highlight objects? that, but for text
[08:48:24] <nshepperd2> yeah i guess you could probably train a model on gwernpaste data to select the most interesting part from a document
[08:48:58] <PapuaHardyNet> yep!
[08:50:17] <nshepperd2> why bother when we already have a gwern though
[08:50:27] <gwern> I wouldn't say I select the 'most interesting', necessarily. often I just go for the funniest
[08:50:36] <gwern> it's a mix of objectives
[08:50:47] <nshepperd2> and it's not like the results would be nearly as amusing as whole cloth invention

[09:34:44] <feep[work]> I have learnt a neat thing a few days ago, and it possibly relates to meditation
[09:35:04] <feep[work]> I've always been prone to obsessing about intrusive thoughts
[09:35:27] <feep[work]> like, you think something and then you go "please don't think that again" and "does thinking that make me a bad person" and your brain just hears
[09:35:36] <feep[work]> "this is an IMPORTANT thought I should think it AGAIN AND AGAIN"
[09:36:13] <feep[work]> (srsly, day I read the wikipedia page on "intrusive thoughts" not kidding, best day of my life)
[09:36:30] <feep[work]> anyway, a few years ago I was a total dick to someone at lwcw
[09:36:49] <feep[work]> I apologized after, we're good I think, but every week or so my brain is like "

[09:36:58] <feep[work]> "hey, remember that time you were a dick to someone at lwcw"
[09:37:07] <feep[work]> "that was shitty of you, wasn't it? WASN'T IT"
[09:37:14] <PapuaHardyNet> yes, it was
[09:37:18] <feep[work]> not the point
[09:37:29] <feep[work]> and I'll be like "shut up brain, you are making a much bigger deal of this than it deserves"
[09:37:46] <feep[work]> and brain is like "I'll shut up ... FOR NOW. This is clearly an IMPORTANT thought I need to think AGAIN AND AGAIN"
[09:37:52] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: I've used TightVNC for at least a decade now
[09:37:59] <adiabatic> it works with Screens on the mac-client side
[09:38:00] <feep[work]> and anyway, I figured this out a few days ago
[09:38:17] <feep[work]> the trick, and this sounds very similar to meditation, is to *allow* yourself to think the bad thought
[09:38:28] <feep[work]> allow yourself to feel the cringe and embarrassment, and *let it pass through you*.
[09:38:44] <adiabatic> a surprisingly useful technique
[09:38:45] <feep[work]> that *does* not mean suppressing, it just means "yes, I acknowledge this. This is a valued thought."
[09:38:51] <feep[work]> and somehow that helps!
[09:39:00] <PapuaHardyNet> it's like petting a dog that keeps asking for attention?
[09:39:07] <feep[work]> no it's like petting a cat
[09:39:10] <feep[work]> you move in to pet and it walks off
[09:39:25] <PapuaHardyNet> that's better
[09:39:43] <feep[work]> anyway, I went "this is a good thought, it reminds me to do better in the future"
[09:39:49] <feep[work]> and within *minutes* I felt better about it.
[09:40:54] <feep[work]> so in retrospect my problem was more that part of my brain kept trying to integrate an experience and I kept saying "I do not want to integrate this experience" and that other part kept retrying, on loop
[09:41:24] <feep[work]> but as soon as there was somewhere in the self-image to *put* the thought, it calmed down.
[09:41:50] <feep[work]> so you know, that's nice~
[09:42:33] <PapuaHardyNet> I believe KajSotala talks about this in his blog post about self-concept
[09:43:00] <PapuaHardyNet> if not, well, the book that he referred to in his post - Transforming Your Self - talks about something similar
[09:43:57] <PapuaHardyNet> using that mental model, what was happening is that by not accepting that incident as an example of your own behavior in your past or an example of what happens when you are pushed past your limits,
[09:44:05] <PapuaHardyNet> it becomes a driver of instability of your self-concept
[09:44:34] <feep[work]> can you operationalize that more? like, there's a lot of "is" statements in there
[09:44:37] <feep[work]> what does what
[09:44:48] <PapuaHardyNet> let's try this with an example
[09:45:15] <PapuaHardyNet> let's say I screamed at my wife. Now, let's say she forgives me. But I constantly feel guilt over it
[09:45:28] <PapuaHardyNet> It destabilizes my self-concept of being a caring and loving husband
[09:45:44] <feep[work]> oh right
[09:46:17] <feep[work]> yeah that makes sense
[09:46:23] <feep[work]> it's a cognitive dissonance
[09:46:27] <PapuaHardyNet> by accepting that I only act that way when I'm extremely distressed, or sleep deprived, I know my limits, am now aware of them, and accept that I still am a caring and loving husband
[09:46:44] <feep[work]> or, as I did, by instrumentalizing the memory as a *tool* for becoming more caring and loving
[09:46:51] <PapuaHardyNet> yes, exactly
[09:47:24] <feep[work]> the point is there's somewhere to put it in the model

[10:30:48] <feep[work]> quanticle: if the idea generalizes, my advice is find *some* use for the thought
[10:31:24] <feep[work]> like, find some motivation that justifies thinking that
[10:31:29] <feep[work]> this seems paradoxical
[10:31:42] <feep[work]> like, wouldn't finding a motivation to think it just make you think it more?
[10:31:54] <feep[work]> but as far as I can tell, it removes the urgency your brain has of reporting it to you.

[10:34:14] <feep[work]> no like, "I moved past it" is not the sort of 
[10:34:21] <feep[work]> that didn't work for me either
[10:34:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> I was a dick to someone once in my life and I still have that same experience sometimes
[10:34:38] <feep[work]> you can't just *assert* that you moved past it.

[11:50:43] <adiabatic> and this is Windows just now?
[11:50:47] <quanticle> No, this is Linux
[11:50:49] <feep[work]> is this ubuntu?
[11:50:53] <quanticle> This is Ubuntu
[11:50:59] <feep[work]> welp okay, I don't know then
[11:51:05] * feep[work] doesn't use it..
[11:55:26] <capisce> quanticle: right, although plenty of Windows users suffer from poor I/O performance too, especially developers
[11:58:39] <quanticle> lmao and you can't even restart Gnome any more to fix it
[11:58:43] <quanticle> Because Wayland
[11:59:18] <nshepperd2> wayland sure is a thing
[11:59:46] <saturn2> don't use wayland, lol
[12:00:04] <feep[work]> indeed
[12:00:11] <saturn2> don't use wayland, don't use systemd, don't live in a pod, don't eat the bugs
[12:00:21] <quanticle> So yeah, on the one hand, I get good disk I/O, and a terminal that can display Unicode without breaking. On the other hand, I take a screenshot and my alt-tab stops working and the only way to get it back is to log out and log back in. Oh well, good thing I use tmux.
[12:00:30] <nshepperd2> use kde lol

[12:01:24] <capisce> try KDE
[12:01:28] <feep[work]> do try kde
[12:01:39] <feep[work]> it crashes too, but you can restart the individual parts of it when it does
[12:02:23] <quanticle> Eh, I don't want to break things even more. Like, if this were Fedora, I'd switch to KDE *immediately*. But this is Ubuntu, and Ubuntu, in my experience, has always been more finicky about you moving away from its default desktop environment.
[12:02:29] <feep[work]> nah
[12:02:34] <feep[work]> literally never be an issue ime
[12:02:39] <capisce> I've been using KDE for work including tools like Microsoft Teams, Zoom, VirtualBox etc for several years without any major issue
[12:03:01] <quanticle> On Ubuntu? Did you install Kubuntu, or did you install regular Ubuntu and then swap to KDE?
[12:03:08] <feep[work]> regular ubuntu
[12:03:11] <feep[work]> sudo apt install kde-full
[12:03:25] <capisce> KDE should be well supported on Ubuntu, don't think there's a major difference between Kubuntu and Ubuntu with KDE?

[12:24:37] <LeoTal> Well lads. Throwing away over a man-month of work, lads
[12:27:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: What can we call it when you realize that all available desktop environments are fucking terrible? "Togpilled" perhaps
[12:28:07] <LeoTal> PSA: Cosmos DB may or may not be good (can't speak to that), but its the MongoDB API is utterly unfit for purpose. Missing critical features, poorly documented, cryptic error messages, forces you to write enormously expensive aggregate queries to work around the missing features, quickly runs into rate and payload size limits.
[12:28:13] <feep[work]> bashpilled
[12:28:35] <feep[work]> LeoTal: aw that sucks, but yeah that matches my experience
[12:28:42] <feep[work]> shoulda used postgres. always use postgres.
[12:29:04] <feep[work]> literally use postgres to save json documents.
[12:29:35] <feep[work]> I mean, you'd think "a specialized database will be better" and you would be wrong.
[12:29:39] <LeoTal> Well it's an old-ish, large-ish app with complex Mongo requests, so we didn't want to migrate off Mongo if we could avoid it
[12:30:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... someone made a DSL account just to post in this thread about toxic masculinity, then apparently didn't like the results and fucked off
[12:30:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Deleted their account

[12:34:26] <LeoTal> I won't be the one who has to do it, but still
[12:34:36] <feep[work]> pain is just weakness leaving the codebase
[12:35:19] <LeoTal> Good slogan, will steal
[12:36:15] <feep[work]> well, an actual agile slogan is "If something hurts, do more of it."
[12:37:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow that's a terrible slogan and a terrible idea
[12:37:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, par for the course for agile
[12:37:25] <feep[work]> it sort of makes sense if you apply it very selectively
[12:37:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then you don't need the damn slogan!
[12:37:40] <feep[work]> I mean, yes
[12:37:46] <feep[work]> the slogan is just a handle to reference a concept
[12:38:05] <capisce> https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FrequencyReducesDifficulty.html
[12:38:06] <Robomot> FrequencyReducesDifficulty ("If it hurts - do it more often". Good advice if the amount of pain raises exponentially with the time between actions, such as for integrating software.)
[12:38:24] <capisce> "If you have this kind of exponential relationship, then if you do it more frequently, you can drastically reduce the pain. And this is what happens with Continuous Integration - by integrating every day, the pain of integration almost vanishes. It did hurt, so you did it more often, and now it no longer hurts."
[12:39:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Continuous integration doesn't hurt" is an... interesting... claim, certainly
[12:39:47] <LeoTal> It hurts less than not continuous integration
[12:40:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, well, that's not what he says there
[12:44:51] <feep[work]> Yes, well, I don't agree with him on everything :VV
[12:45:31] <LeoTal> Hm but I don't think migrating an app to completely new techs should be something you do often (per app). You could reduce the pain by reducing coupling with dependencies, and entirely shunning those that force such coupling (e.g. MongoDB), but I don't see it being worth it
[12:46:00] <feep[work]> yeah it's a balance

[13:24:28] <Robomot> Stephen Malina - Energetic Aliens
[13:25:51] <capisce> LeoTal: migrating to a new tech is not a scheduled recurrent task that will have to happen at regular intervals
[13:26:32] <LeoTal> capisce: Then the proverb doesn't apply at all
[13:30:32] <feep[work]> there's an in-between stage, where you do a task rarely enough that it's painful, but still regularly
[13:32:19] <quanticle> feep[work]: Well, that's what a wiki is for.
[13:32:33] <quanticle> Or rather, a personal wiki
[13:32:46] <feep[work]> a wiki is just a bad shellscript
[13:32:59] <feep[work]> well, for task automation at least
[13:33:05] <quanticle> Sometimes it's easier to look at a wiki page than it is to update a shell script
[13:33:09] <feep[work]> for other things it's a bad textfile
[13:33:18] <quanticle> Fair enough
[13:33:35] <LeoTal> "Mongo bad because coupling" *is* a lesson of the experience, as is "don't invest a month of work on a tech you understand poorly", but my main takeaway is "the MongoDB api for Cosmos DB is unusable"
[13:33:40] <feep[work]> I mean, the point from a programmer perspective is that ... everything you do *should* be automatable, right?
[13:33:50] <feep[work]> that's why like half of lw is programmers
[13:35:08] <feep[work]> from a programmer perspective, ai skepticism is the idea that automation stops at the neck
[13:35:29] <quanticle> Well, everything you do *should* be automatable, but, on the other hand, sometimes writing code to handle all the weird edge cases that could arise with a particular task is onerous enough that you're better off having a person do the thing rather than trying to write code that may behave in unexpected ways in the face of unforeseen circumstances.
[13:35:39] <quanticle> This comes up a lot when you do infrastructure automation
[13:35:50] <quanticle> "Huh, why did terraform create an entire new database?"
[13:36:08] <quanticle> And then you spend hours trying to debug that, when a person could... just set up the DB
[13:36:12] <feep[work]> sure, sometimes you need to hack things
[13:36:32] <feep[work]> but when your tools do random things you don't understand, I think that's a *sufficient* justification to put the hours in.

[13:37:56] <quanticle> Not always. Like, just speaking personally: have I automated the steps to set up my laptop? No. Can I? Sure. I know one of my friends literally spent a weekend writing ansible scripts so that he could run a single ansible command and it would configure his laptop for him. I did (and still do) make fun of him for wasting a weekend in order to save a grand total of 3 hours.
[13:38:22] <feep[work]> sure but setting up my laptop is not a recurring task
[13:38:52] <feep[work]> and if it was, I'd just git commit /etc
[13:39:00] <quanticle> Over a long enough time period it arguably is
[13:39:07] <feep[work]> and then since I'm on gentoo, I could "quickly" reproduce the install state
[13:39:11] <feep[work]> quanticle: it actually isn't
[13:39:21] <feep[work]> I've reinstalled the same os I think like once out of the ten or so reinstalls
[13:39:50] <feep[work]> here at work, we really do have setup as a recurring task
[13:39:55] <quanticle> Ah, so you'd want something more along the lines of Nix
[13:39:59] <feep[work]> and as a consequence, there's a confluence page that really is just "shellscript with docs"
[13:40:33] <feep[work]> there's some stuff that we've installed ad-hoc
[13:40:45] <feep[work]> and that is why half the computers in this company use a different docker package than the other half :P
[13:41:08] <feep[work]> insufficient automation is something one quickly learns to regret.
[13:41:53] <quanticle> Agreed. But "insufficient automation" is easy to see, whereas people wasting time because too much was automated is a less visible cost.
[13:42:04] <feep[work]> sure
[13:42:18] <feep[work]> and the point of the saying is that "pain" is one of the ways in which one sees it.

[15:15:05] <PapuaHardyNet> here's an interesting insight: I've found myself shunning CLI / TUI / suckless equivalent apps for more conenient (if less private) equivalent apps simply because I have less time to waste since I am responsible for a lot more work (and more impactful work) than before
[15:15:32] <PapuaHardyNet> I guess it really is true that minimalism (whether digital or physical) is a method of coping with lack of power over your life
[15:15:52] <feep[work]> I cannot relate to that

[15:16:11] <feep[work]> if you are more productive with cli than gui you should use cli

[15:16:46] <PapuaHardyNet> I agree with you, but your point is unrelated to mine

[20:04:31] <ggreer> other interesting fact: kiba paid vitalik to write about bitcoin

[23:29:17] <gwern> but isn't bender futurama?
[23:30:11] <ggreer> yeah but I think those are the only robot characters that asimov used in multiple novels
[23:30:19] <pompolic> optimizing for multiple audiences i suppose
[23:31:30] <ggreer> if Bender Bending Rodriguez existed in asimov's time, he'd probably be jealous he didn't create such a character
[23:36:45] <kuudes> ah, I should reread foundation
[23:45:07] <dbohdan> gwern: Without nukes, do you think the US would have tried to engineer another retaliatory weapon?  Perhaps we are lucky we are not in the biological MAD timeline.
[23:48:16] <gwern> bioweapons have always been too dangerous to easily use, and chemical weapons are both fairly harmless and there was mutual deterrence on using them
[23:48:21] <vrs> https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1427800982956613632 I don't think the hard problem here is deploying software to n<1000 devices

He’s already got a small RPi based wheeled rover hooked up that way to a cloud server via VPN. Video soon 😎’
[23:48:46] <ggreer> didn't the japanese avoid using chemical weapons on the allies because they were worried they'd get gassed?
[23:48:48] <gwern> does the 'yak' stands for 'yakshaving'
[23:48:53] <ggreer> pretty sure they went wild on the chinese though
[23:49:58] <PapuaHardyNet> dbohdan: do you know of any good biological MAD timeline fiction?
[23:50:33] <PapuaHardyNet> it seems like a really fascinating idea (also please don't recommend SCP, I've read almost all of the good ones)
[23:51:47] <dbohdan> PapuaHardyNet: I am looking it right now and not finding anything
[23:52:27] <kuudes> as we can learn from the possible lab leaks, bioweapons generally seem like a bad idea
[23:53:01] <ggreer> >  In 1944 Ultra revealed that the Japanese doubted their ability to retaliate against United States use of gas. 'Every precaution must be taken not to give the enemy cause for a pretext to use gas,' the commanders were warned. So fearful were the Japanese leaders that they planned to ignore isolated tactical use of gas in the home islands by the US forces because they feared escalation.

[23:53:44] <dbohdan> Bioweapons are an okay idea if your goal is to destroy the world
[23:54:12] <kuudes> sure, but usually you want to do it conditionally
[23:55:18] <ggreer> even the soviets decided against bioweapons. nukes are great because each one's destruction is limited. also you need to be a rather wealthy and technologically advanced nation to make plutonium
[23:55:56] <dbohdan> "If you do X, we will start researching bioweapons, and you know we'll fuck up"
[23:56:20] <pompolic> using docker and kubernetes to orchestrate me stopping reading

[23:57:44] <pompolic> PapuaHardyNet: i feel like metal gear solid kind of counts, although it's not just bioweapons
[23:57:52] <kuudes> dbohdan, how well has that worked for iran?
[23:58:09] <kuudes> though they are threatening on research to make nukes
[23:58:16] <Pharl> Hello.
[23:58:19] <dbohdan> kuudes: Ehhhh
[23:58:34] <dbohdan> Pharl: Heya
[23:58:52] <Pharl> Feels like it should be Friday.
[23:58:56] <Pharl> Or Saturday.
[23:58:58] <dbohdan> Does a lab leak make the threat of using bioweapons more or less effective?
[23:59:17] <dbohdan> On one hand, if a leak is manageable, it makes bioweapon attacks seem manageable
[23:59:47] <dbohdan> On the other hand, it can be framed as "See, this is 1/10 as a bad as an intention use of a bioweapon would be"
