[02:33:01] <since_> hi, what should i do if i want to always have a buffered channel
[02:33:17] <since_> should i set the channel buffer size to int max?
[02:33:30] <KirkMcDonald> No.
[02:33:53] <KirkMcDonald> If your goal is a queue that dynamically grows in size, that isn't a thing that channels do.
[02:34:04] *** Joins: Guest84 (~Guest84@2406:3003:2006:447e:9d85:ae5b:bc5f:9191)
[02:34:10] <Tv_> also at that point, consider disk-based queues
[02:34:11] <since_> set size to 100; insert using select; and in the default case start a goroutine inserting?
[02:34:30] <Tv_> since_: even better: architect system to have backpressure
[02:34:55] <Tv_> (or, explicitly choose lossy signaling)
[02:35:12] <foobaz> saying you always want to have a buffered channel is equivalent to saying you always want your server to have sufficient capacity to handle all requests
[02:35:39] <foobaz> it makes sense to want it but in reality the performance will not always be there and you should design your software to handle that situation instead of pretending it does not exist
[02:35:41] <Tv_> foobaz: it's saying "please run out of memory on problems"
[02:35:57] <foobaz> also "several minutes of latency is acceptable"
[02:36:51] <since_> Tv_: with lossy signaling you mean inserting using select and empty default, right?
[02:36:58] <foobaz> even with a small buffer, the buffer will only reach maximum size when the server is backed up
[02:37:09] <Tv_> since_: that's what it would look like channels, yes. and it's called sending.
[02:37:23] <foobaz> there are only two steady-state scenarios: zero buffer, and full buffer, anything in between is a system transitioning from one state to another
[02:38:03] <foobaz> to perform well in the full buffer situation, you need a reasonably sized buffer, a channel buffer full of millions of objects will not exhibit acceptable behavior
[02:38:05] <since_> thank you, sounds a like a good idea
[02:38:58] <KirkMcDonald> I mostly see the purpose of a buffered channel to be papering over operations which take variable amounts of time.
[02:39:23] <KirkMcDonald> Like, an operation which completes immediately most of the time, but sometimes takes a measurable amount of time.

[02:39:36] <KirkMcDonald> So you sometimes just want to stack up requests while that's happening.
[02:40:28] <KirkMcDonald> And hopefully the system's processing of requests still keeps up with its receipt of requests in aggregate.
[02:41:11] <Tv_> it can also, with luck, work as a batching mechanism. send send send, scheduler, receive receive receive
[02:42:54] <since_> yup agree, thanks

[10:52:36] <f8l12> i guess
[10:53:12] <nevivurn> I haven't read the actual map implementations, but my guess is the compiler would translate the m[v]++ to something like _v := m[v]; m[v] = _v+1
[10:53:40] <f8l12> yeah, it might be special syntax for map that i don't know about
[10:53:53] <nevivurn> There's no special syntax for maps, as far as I can tell in the spec.

[10:57:59] <iateadonut> but basically, i want to send {"json":"stuff"} to lambda, and i want {"yup":"ok"} as a response, and i want that within my test suite.
[10:58:38] <f8l12> oh ok i didn't know if you meant aws lambda or not. i know nothing about that, sorry
[10:59:08] <b0nn> iateadonut: look at the sam cli
[10:59:10] <iateadonut> i've heard the suggestion a few times now to give users the option to turn on logging when you build a package (so that logging should not show unless specifically requested)... how do you normally do that?
[11:02:53] <nevivurn> Not super easy to do with stdlib log, you would need to wrap all the logging with your own helpers that check whether the user requested logging or not.
[11:03:35] <nevivurn> Some third-party logging libraries do this, and some even provide log levels & configurable output log level, so users can request "only critical logs" for instance
[11:06:17] <iateadonut> b0nn, thanks.  nevivum, alright, i'll keep a lookout - i think logrus is pretty popular.
[11:06:37] <iateadonut> but with testing, you can only see your own logging with the "-v" tag; should you do something like that?
[11:07:38] <b0nn> iateadonut: get your users to supply the logger that they want you to use

[11:37:24] <toretto> ah, for some reason this domain doesn't showup on the results.
[11:37:25] <toretto> thanks
[11:39:20] <f8l12> toretto, nevivurn pointed out a cleaner syntax for that. you could just do this by the way: https://play.golang.org/p/WYNsvF3FGO-
[11:40:43] <f8l12> it's not very intuitive syntax imo, but just know that will work too :P
[11:40:54] <toretto> ah, but i guess that line expands to `m[word] = m[word] + 1`, but i'm not sure what'd the value of an undefined key if it's iterating for the first time.
[11:41:10] <toretto> i've actually thought of that, but it doesn't work for my case so i gave up.
[11:41:20] <nevivurn> toretto: it's the "zero value" for that type, which is zero fir ints
[11:41:58] <toretto> ah
[11:42:09] <toretto> yeah, you're right.
[11:42:28] <toretto> i was actually confused that it might be some undefined value.
[11:43:04] <f8l12> that's why go has the value, ok := m[index] syntax, to check if values are in the map or not
[11:43:06] <nevivurn> There are very few things in Go that result in undefined behavior, apart from races.
[11:43:39] <toretto> so, will it always be initilized to some known value if it's a hash-map? like, if it's `map[string]int`, the values, eventhough the keys doesn't exist will be initilized to the *default* value? and if it's `map[int]string`, the strings would be initilized to `""` (empty string)?
[11:43:43] <toretto> right?
[11:44:00] <nevivurn> toretto: if you're asking whether m[s] will initialize the value in the map, the answer is no.
[11:44:28] <nevivurn> as in, `_ = m[someValue]; _, ok := m[someValue]` will be false.
[11:44:50] <toretto> i see, so that syntax `m[word]++` works because `m[SOME_UNDEFINE_KEY]` is initilized to zero in teh case of `map[string]int` on nevivurn's code, right?
[11:45:10] <toretto> on line 1
[11:45:12] <foobaz> yes, the zero value of a string is ""
[11:45:13] <toretto> *12
[11:45:28] <toretto> foobaz: i see.
[11:45:46] <toretto> makes sense. so it would be indeed initilized to some default values.
[11:46:01] <toretto> i'm not sure what'd the case if it's a user defined structure.
[11:46:27] <toretto> maybe pointeres will be default initilzed to `nil` and floats with `0.0` and ints to `0` and strings to `""` and so on?
[11:46:33] <foobaz> https://golang.org/ref/spec#The_zero_value
[11:46:33] <toretto> for the members of the struct
[11:49:18] <nevivurn> toretto: the zero value is a well-defined concept for all go types, including your own types.
[11:49:40] <nevivurn> https://golang.org/ref/spec#The_zero_value
[11:50:14] <nevivurn> oh, I can'
[11:50:19] <nevivurn> t't read, apparently.
[11:50:59] <toretto> so, about the structs in particular, i was correct, right?

[15:23:24] <ztx> fizzie: thanks for pointing out the mistakes, I fixed 'em. But when I run "go build ." while being in "hello" directory I get "build example.com/hello: cannot find module for path example.com/greetings"

[15:24:34] <fizzie> Odd. As in that paste, it works for me. What's `go version` say?
[15:24:58] <fizzie> Not that I think there's any specific version that would need, beyond basic module support.
[15:24:59] <ztx> 1.11.6, according to "go version" output
[15:25:50] <fizzie> Hmm, that's a little on the old side.
[15:25:51] <j416> that's more than 2 years old; you might want to upgrade
[15:26:02] <fizzie> It *might* be that replace directives were added in 1.13.
[15:26:10] <ztx> I'm doing it in wsl2/debian instance, I'm gonna ssh into archlinux machine and try there
[15:26:22] <ztx> oh
[15:29:21] <fizzie> Nah, https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go@go1.11.6 already mentions "replace", so it was a thing back then. Well, still maybe worth upgrading.
