[00:06:46] <simcop2387> vms14: xephyr is better than xnest for this, since it supports all kinds of extensions like glx, xinerama, and others.  so testing a fullly functional WM is a lot easier
[00:07:26] <simcop2387> Xephyr -screen 1280x720 -screen 1280x720 +xinerama :2 ; simulate a dual monitor server with xinerama to mimic a modern DE/WM with two monitors
[00:07:37] <simcop2387> or something like that
[00:07:40] <vms14> I don't need extensions for testing the wm
[00:07:50] <vms14> the only extension I plan to use is xshape
[00:08:02] <vms14> and for the xpm library I'll have to write some xss
[00:08:04] <simcop2387> for starting no, but you're going to want to be able to test against some of them eventually if you want it to actually be usable
[00:08:18] <vms14> I only need to export one function, but I don't know about xs
[00:08:42] <simcop2387> take a look at FFI::Platypus instead of XS.  it might be significantly easier for you to use
[00:08:45] <vms14> simcop2387: what about make the wm able to reload code while running?

[00:09:28] <simcop2387> vms14: xephyr and such won't directly affect that, and you should be able to reload C stuff with FFI::Platypus at run time (though i'm not sure if you'll have to do any tricks)

[00:12:30] <simcop2387> vms14: FFI::Platypus should let you load the .so at run time, and grab the function from it as a coderef to call so you should be able to just load it again and get a new coderef.  i think.  there might be some caching layer you have to make things ignore for the underlying dlopen() call

[12:33:41] <haj1> hudo: That doesn't compile.  You can't define a lexical "my" for a hash element
[12:34:59] <haj1> Without that "my", the code checks whether $be_opts{ssh_cmd} is defined, and if not, tries to populate it from  $be_opts{local_ssh_cmd}, then from calling $any->_find_cmd
[12:35:38] <hudo> that is an original line from Net::SSH::Any
[12:38:46] <hudo> interesting is, I have debian stretch with perl version 5 , where I get the following "warning" from a script: Scalar found where operator expected at /usr/local/share/perl/5.20.2/Net/SSH/Any/Backend/Net_OpenSSH.pm line 48, near "// $any"  (Missing operator before  $any?)
[12:39:21] <hudo> and I have debian bullseye with perl version 32 , where there is no more warning
[12:39:38] <hudo> debian stretch with perl version 20
[12:40:55] <hudo> hajl if populating from $be_opts{local_ssh_cmd} succeeds then no further operation is done ? 
[12:46:28] <haj1> hudo: Correct!  // is "defined or" and shortcuts if  $be_opts{local_ssh_cmd} is defined
[12:49:48] <hudo> is this a correct interpretation:
[12:49:58] <hudo> if defined ( $be_opts{ssh_cmd} )  do nothing
[12:50:05] <hudo> otherwise

[12:51:44] <haj1> Botje: What did I miss?
[12:51:56] <Botje> the deleted value (or output of _find_cmd) is assigned to $be_opts{ssh_cmd} in the latter two cases.
[12:53:39] <haj1> Ah, correct. if ( defined( delete $be_opts{local_ssh_cmd} ) ) -> assign it to $be_opts{ssh_cmd}
[12:54:47] <hudo> what has changed from perl 20 to perl 32 that it doesn't throw the warning anymore ?
[12:55:30] <Botje> that's not a warning, that's an error.
[12:56:49] <haj1> I just installed that distribution, and indeed: Net/SSH/Any/Backend/Net_OpenSSH.pm does not compile
[12:57:04] <hudo> the modul Net::SSH::Any is still the same 
[12:57:42] <Botje> if I were to guess: something involving the parsing of delete.

[15:07:12] <Altreus> You *may* have issues with fonts
[15:07:38] <Altreus> My first instinct would be to try to read the PDF as data, extract the text from the columns, and render it as HTML

[16:02:52] <logioniz> Hi, I have a question about DBI. I'm trying to use the AutoInactiveDestroy property, but my DESTROY is still called. After searching for the problem, I found that _install_method is called in the DBI, which checks for pid. Apparently, it is not automatically installed.
[16:03:14] <logioniz>  I am trying to install it using the install_method method but failed as the DESTROY function is capitalized and the methods are not installed with capital letters

[16:47:01] <joakimk> ,So, I'm trying to understand how to use PDF::API2 to crop a PDF into "vertical strips", using crop/cropbox, but I just can't get a handle on it
[16:48:27] <joakimk> I am able to open the PDF, and crop it, and save it, but I can't seem to be able to shift the cropping to the right per file... Here's my attempt: for ($i=0; $i < 6; $i++) { my $pdf = PDF::API2->open('file.pdf'); $pdf->cropbox($start + $i * 50, 50, $start + ($i + 1) * 50, 150); $pdf->openpage(1); $name = 'cropped' . $i . '.pdf';
[16:48:27] <joakimk> $pdf->saveas($name); }
[16:49:09] <joakimk> just some fixed coordinates there, as you can see, where each "strip" (file) should be 50 pixels (?) wide...
[16:49:42] <Altreus> POF2PNG might be your go-to really ... I thought PDF::API2 might be able to save images but I suppose not
[16:50:03] <joakimk> so, convert to PNG, and then crop/clip it?
[16:50:18] <joakimk> cause I do need PNG output (5 files) at the end, anyway

[18:36:51] <Botje> ... no?
[18:37:09] <Botje> it just creates a lib link that points back to the current directory.

[18:40:36] <Botje> I don't think you know what a forkbomb is.
[18:41:26] <khosruw> Botje it's: In computing, a fork bomb (also called rabbit virus or wabbit[1]) is a denial-of-service attack wherein a process continually replicates itself to deplete available system resources, slowing down or crashing the system due to resource starvation.
[18:41:36] <khosruw> thanks to wikipedia.org
[18:42:47] <Botje> "ln" is a process that ends when it has created the link.
[18:42:52] <Botje> so no, it is not a forkbomb.

[21:02:33] <Mandevil> It could easily run in the web servers, but it needs to be singular.
[21:03:04] <Mandevil> Whereas you usually keep multiple web servers running to handle the clients.
[21:03:05] <simcop2387> Mandevil: some kind of simple tcp server then is probably what i'd start with and then let some kind of supervisory task handle keeping a singular one running.  systemd, container, etc.

[21:04:31] <simcop2387> Mandevil: might be a weird idea, but check out MQTT?
[21:04:49] <simcop2387> you can have clients both poll and be pushed data and can have multiple of either
[21:05:01] <xq> seems like some pub/sub
[21:05:02] <simcop2387> and can have security/authentication involved too
[21:05:03] <Mandevil> Hm, interesting idea.
[21:05:25] <simcop2387> xq: yea and mqtt sounds like it could do that pubsub pretty easily as long as he's not needing an actual queue.
[21:05:25] <Mandevil> Not sure if it's not an overkill.
[21:05:47] <Mandevil> I basically can just run a webserver and have the background task inside of it, but then there needs to be just one instance.
[21:05:51] <Mandevil> Otherwise things break
[21:06:01] <simcop2387> yea it might be slightly overkill but consider that you can then use proper security, *AND* there are managed/hosted instances in say AWS for you if you really wanted

[21:58:28] <rindolf> vms14: nice
[22:00:38] <vms14> but, the <<HEREDOC for me it's fine and the slurp function, I think it's fine to not explicitly close the filehandle as long as the scope dies I understand that the filehandle is closed
[22:01:26] <vms14> I like the examples of slurping in different bad ways
[22:01:47] <vms14> it makes me understand what the perl motto happens to be useful
[22:02:44] <vms14> there is more than bad way to do one thing and few good ways to do something, that's a concept general in programming not tied to perl
[22:03:14] <vms14> and happens that the way of the common prograammer tends to be a bad way, until he receives some expertise with the years
[22:03:29] <vms14> so in perl your bad way is accessible
[22:03:40] <vms14> it's a bad way, but it's the way you do stuff
[22:04:04] <vms14> once you are a better programmer, a better way was also accessible from the start

[22:05:40] <vms14> huf: yes, but not so many as in perl
[22:05:56] <huf> vms14: yeah there are, they're just way longer to say :)
[22:06:02] <vms14> so it's more possible than one of them binds better with the way you have to do stuff
[22:06:06] <huf> but the point is, inexperienced people find them all the same
[22:06:26] <vms14> and also happens that you can end using all the ways in your "learning journey"
[22:06:49] <simcop2387> huf: "Hey guys, did you know Rust is a lot easier if you just put everything in unsafe{}? it doesn't complain at all about the lifetimes or borrowing anymore"
[22:06:52] <simcop2387> :)
[22:06:53] <vms14> cause you can improve a bit and find a bad way that it's better than your old bad way
[22:07:21] <vms14> simcop2387: there is an equivalent for haskell?
[22:07:28] <vms14> xD
[22:07:48] <huf> simcop2387: :)
[22:07:59] <nshp> heh, people always say that, but rustc still checks type and lifetime safety in your unsafe{} blocks
[22:08:38] <nshp> you still have to try extra hard to tell it to shut up and mind its own business in there
[22:12:18] <vms14> what I wanted to mean is that perl seems like a playground for learning programming due to the flexibility it has, and also the way it implements stuff, ex objects and how much you can learn about the internals and do stuff in it. objects for me were a joke, but they provide a "simple" object system that works and can provide you most of what you do expect, but you can also create your own object system and perl won't complaint or be a
[22:12:18] <vms14> trouble like in most other languages
[22:13:02] <vms14> I usually cannot explain what I really think and people end understanding another stuff, so sorry
[22:13:24] <vms14> it's not really what I want to mean of how I see perl
[22:13:53] <vms14> but the flexibility it has for me is one of the best features a language can provide
[22:13:53] <nshp> yeah, I think a lot of that is inspired by lisp
[22:14:00] <nshp> (or accidental)
[22:14:09] <vms14> I love common lisp, maybe that's why I like perl
[22:14:17] <nshp> that seems to be a trend
[22:14:33] <vms14> the reason I stick with perl is because I'm a person who never finishes the stuff
[22:14:35] <nshp> a lot of lispy folks use perl as their "I don't feel like writing whole words right now" quick and dirty scripting language
[22:15:01] <vms14> and perl at least let's me have a quick and dirty script instead of just thoughts
[22:16:11] <vms14> at the end I have very few code in common lisp, but that code is kind of magic, I mean clever stuff and things usually you never think a normal language would be able to do
[22:16:42] <vms14> but the number of .pl is like 7 times more than the .lisp
[22:17:44] <gordonfish> [OT] Does anyone else remember IMDB having the ability to search by character name (e.g., to see what other films, shows, etc had a character by that name) ?

[22:18:53] <daemon> though I thought you got that by going to the actor/actress

[23:14:59] <vms14> no, it saves a message for a user who it's usually offline
[23:15:17] <vms14> the next time the user speaks on the channel the bot will reply the message

[23:15:54] <alh> Isn't that what memoserv is for?
[23:16:03] <vms14> it's just to provide the feature irc does not provide, which is to send messages to an offline user
[23:16:12] <corwin> Hrm.  I ususally use memoserv for that.  There are some bots that automate interacting with memoserv, I know.
[23:16:13] <vms14> alh: sounds like it is, for the name
[23:16:41] <vms14> but idk if perlbot already provides this feature
[23:16:49] <choroba> yes, that's exactly what memoserv does
[23:17:19] <gordonfish> Re: <Botje> gordonfish: https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/ # you can
[23:17:20] <vms14> for me perlbot is kind of a master piece (cause it's hard to provide a secured sandboxed evaling stuff)

[23:17:22] <gordonfish> Thanks, there is some useful stuff in there, though as the page states near the top, "Subsets of IMDb data are available for access", they don't make the full cast available unfortunately, just the principal (effectively the top billed) cast and crew (in title.principals.tsv.gz)

[23:34:24] <vms14> maybe basheval could be the way to break something?

[23:35:38] <vms14> I'd like to break it before I die, but I won't be able to do it I guess
[23:36:10] <vms14> by break, mean maybe just compromise some stuff, but it's not a bot made in one day
[23:37:52] <vms14> If I'm dying I'll ask it simcop2387 to reveal me a way to break it
