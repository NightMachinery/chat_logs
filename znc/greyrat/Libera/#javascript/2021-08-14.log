[01:23:57] <matsaman> wallbroken: I think what he's probably trying to say is that while you're checking if aStatus is equivalen to NS_ERROR_NET_RESET, your other OR (||) option is only checking if NS_ERROR_UKNOWN_HOST exists at all
[01:24:03] <matsaman> equivalent*
[01:24:23] <matsaman> but instead of that he said the dumbest shit he could say "nu-uh no workie"
[01:24:52] <wallbroken> he told me this:
[01:24:54] <wallbroken> the always true will lead to it treating any event as a reconnect if I understand the code correctly.
[01:24:54] <wallbroken> but essentially you have to do a == b || a == c to check if a is equal to b or c.
[01:25:29] <matsaman> yup, that's what I said
[01:25:38] <matsaman> if he said that too, then he's not a total tosspot

[02:00:48] <systemfault> The point of an async function is to remove the "promise-style", you replace (most....) of the promise functions (then/catch/resolve/reject/etc) with normal imperative constructs
[02:01:24] <systemfault> then become "await", catch becomes "try/catch", resolve becomes "return", reject becomes "throw"... etc

[03:12:38] <jaawerth> oh right, I'd need a Promise.all around it

[03:12:57] <GreenJello> it gives you an array of settled objects

[03:14:09] <jaawerth> ohh I see the object has descriptive properties
[03:14:11] <GreenJello> and defining the interface in the language gives people something to build on top of

[03:49:26] <entuland> seems like you can only compute the width of the border _or_ the width of the scrollbar, if you guarantee you don't use one or the other - if you have both, seems like the only way is accessing the computed styles
[03:50:09] <entuland> I am working this around by making sure the elements never gets a scrollbar, but I was curious if I was missing any obvious non-computed-styles technique

[03:52:25] <entuland> I've found some pretty bad hacks creating hidden elements, adding stuff to them till you got a scrollbar and checking the values as you go to find out ahahahah (old SO using jQuery and whatnot)
[03:52:32] <entuland> the wonders of scouring the internet :P
[03:56:32] <jaawerth> I'm actually always getting 7 regardless of browser
[03:56:43] <entuland> when the scrollbar is visible?
[03:56:43] <jaawerth> well, in ff andchrome. maybe I'm doing it wrong
[03:56:45] <entuland> that's odd
[03:56:57] <jaawerth> when I hit enter new boxes appear nad it gets weird but the numbers don't change
[03:56:58] <entuland> the problem only happens when there is a scrollbar in those two boxes
[03:57:23] <entuland> probably the keyboard event isn't getting fired?

[04:28:39] <jaawerth> entuland: anyway, I blieve it's because clientWidth changes with respect to the scrollbar, and it's the only property that does since clientLeft only changes with regard to a left-hand-side scrollbar. if you add `direction: ltr` you'll magically find it's always 7 because clinetLeft will now include the scroll bar
[04:28:44] <jaawerth> of course, that's not what youw ant
[04:29:22] <entuland> yep that would just move the problem from computing only the right border width to computing both the left and rigth border widths :P
[04:30:08] <entuland> ah no, that would just move the problem from right to left, my bad
[04:30:14] <entuland> still :P
[04:31:10] <entuland> it just feels like that's a missing feature or an overlooked consequence of how the various offset / client dimensions get affected
[04:33:36] *** Joins: onosendi1 (~onosendi@user/onosendi)
[04:36:05] <jaawerth> yeah I'm thinking what properties I would use to account for this and all I can think of offhand is either using getComputedStyle or the gnarly hack of toggling the direction to ltr and back, which would cause reflows and I imagine you'd be better off with getComputedStyle

[04:37:13] <entuland> it's okay, the solution I have is enough - I just have another element to wrap the contents inside of this box to get a scrollbar that doesn't affect the computation
[04:37:49] <entuland> I may end up filing an issue or a feature request somewhere :P
[04:38:46] <entuland> I'll have to find out where that "somewhere" is first ahahahha

[04:39:22] <jaawerth> (whatwg dom spec, I mean)
[04:39:33] <jaawerth> but it seems like something that would have been discussed before
[04:39:42] <jaawerth> also I'm not a styles expert so I could be forgetting something
[04:39:48] <entuland> yeah, maybe I just wasn't able to find it
[04:39:59] <entuland> just plenty of ugly hacks all over the place since a decade or so
[04:40:09] <jaawerth> I mean... it used to be way worse lol
[04:40:16] <entuland> indeed, can't really complain
[04:40:32] <entuland> nowadays it's a pleasure to code in JS - for me at least :P

[16:51:29] <dev4449> Hi. Good day.
[16:51:58] <dev4449> The resource I'm learning javascript from mentions: "If later on you need to reassign one of your const, simply make it a let and it will be enough. I find that for myself, it’s better to make them const by default. Then I see errors if I accidentally try to reassign them rather than having to debug the code later just to find out that I was
[16:51:58] <dev4449> referencing the wrong variable."
[16:52:48] <dev4449> I'm not sure if I'm getting this. Is it generally a better practice to always use const, and change to let when you get an error complaining about reasigning a const variable?
[16:54:19] <silly_> yes
[16:54:34] <matsaman> there are two schools
[16:54:53] <silly_> but you can also use let from the beginning, if you know you will reassign
[16:54:55] <matsaman> the warn me at every turn school, and the leave me alone and let me twist in my own mistakes school
[16:55:10] <silly_> you don't have to wait for a warning
[16:55:17] <silly_> if you know it will come
[16:55:32] <matsaman> or if you're able to just double-check your assumptions when you encounter an error
[16:56:33] <dev4449> I see. okay.
[16:57:05] <silly_> n> const x = "a"; let y = "b"; y = 5;
[16:57:06] <jellobot> (okay) 5

[17:04:58] <gehn> dev4449, consider how you can accomplish your goals while still using const, don't just change to let simply because you get an error
[17:05:10] <gehn> there is usually a way to keep (almost) everything const

[19:20:57] <IceMichael> yeah, I figured you would understand the difference well enough at that level of JS
[19:21:23] <IceMichael> hm, anyway, why do you use reload here by the way?
[19:21:52] <IceMichael> probably you can remove it, no?

[19:23:34] *** kill is now known as php
[19:24:22] <IceMichael> kill, clear but is the reload line needed?
[19:24:43] <php> IceMichael, unless I use iframes
[19:24:57] <IceMichael> ah... okay, I don't like iframes too much
[19:25:05] <IceMichael> but sometimes necessary unfortunately
[19:25:06] <php> ok
[19:25:16] <php> I could try to use iframes
[19:25:25] <IceMichael> as said, would recommend against it
[19:25:44] <IceMichael> hm... but normally if you change the URL of an image, reload should not be needed, still puzzled. But anyways, might be my thinking error

[22:21:25] <codebam> if I have [{ name: '',  year: '' }] how can I sort the array by year?
[22:21:43] <codebam> also how can I do it onclick for a column header
[22:22:33] <codebam> would I sort and then just set the state?
[22:22:43] <cis> codebam: you can call .sort() on the array, and give it a comparison function that compares the .year property of the objects
[22:23:16] <codebam> oh okay cool. thank you
[22:23:28] <han-solo> `things.sort((a, b) => a.year > b.year ? 1 : -1)` or something like that
[22:23:41] <hassoon> php: why do you insist on setting the onckicl html attribute? it means nothing
[22:23:48] <han-solo> and hope year is a number ? otherwise `Number(a.year)..` ?
[22:23:51] <hassoon> php: your event handlers are registered for you
[22:24:21] <GreenJello> codebam, in react you'd store which field you're sorting by, and then slice+sort while rendering
[22:24:40] <codebam> how do I slice+sort while rendering?
[22:24:45] <codebam> I can show my code
[22:24:46] <han-solo> or +a.year...is it Okay to use `+numberInString` ?
[22:25:05] <cis> codebam: yeah, that would work - keep in mind that .sort() operates in place, so if you're updating react state it probably won't detect that as a change, since the array is still the same
[22:25:30] <codebam> https://github.com/codebam/react-gametracker
[22:25:35] <Lewix> What happens when we await for Promise.allSettled inside of an async () => {} , is it ok
[22:26:00] <qswz> sure
[22:26:04] <cis> codebam: but, if you're updating other parts of state, like which column you're sorting by, or whether it's asc or desc, then that will trigger the re-render, so it's fine
[22:26:21] <qswz> things.sort((a, b) => a.year - b.year)
[22:26:31] <codebam> cis: oh I was going to sort the localstorage data and then set it back in the state. is that alright?
[22:28:18] <codebam> instead of sorting the state
[22:29:07] <cis> codebam: in that case you'll get a new array since everything in localStorage is a string
[22:30:06] <php> hassoon yes it means something
[22:30:24] <php> and yes I know what onclick does
[22:30:32] <php> and yes onclick is working
[22:30:35] <qswz> onlick
[22:31:02] <qswz> how do you react onlick?
[22:31:31] <php> I react well when it works well
[22:31:33] <php> lol
[22:31:55] <qswz> by a goat, they can do it for salt
[22:32:24] <codebam> yes I got a brand new array and set it and I got it working. how can I have it toggle direction?
[22:32:31] <codebam> I'll push the code I have so far
[22:32:48] <qswz> toggle direction? like reverse?

[22:33:09] <cis> codebam: keep track of which direction you're sorting in state, and use that to modify your sort comparison function
[22:33:28] <qswz> yea that
[22:33:29] <php> looks like this channel intention is only to discourage begginners in every means, I hope not everyone is like that
[22:33:49] <codebam> cis: oh good idea thank you
[22:33:51] <cis> php: what?
[22:34:13] <cis> codebam: if you can sort by multiple columns, then you'd also have a state variable to keep track of which column you sort by
[22:34:23] <qswz> discourage about what? we discourage bad practices
[22:34:33] <cis> codebam: and you can set defaults for both of those variables to sort by some column to begin with
