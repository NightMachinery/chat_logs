[00:02:22] <jstoddard> I have a really ugly elf onscreen, proving to myself that .png images work, and their transparency works too. Also a reminder that I have no talent for drawing. I feel like a kid with a new toy, hahaha.
[00:03:15] <borodust> üëçüëçüëç
[00:04:16] <borodust> hopefully, that should display like a bunch of thumbs up ;p
[00:04:22] <borodust> my font can't handle so much abuse
[00:09:41] <jstoddard> Emacs/ERC doesn't like it so much, but copied and pasted anywhere else it seems to show up.
[00:10:59] <artchad> borodust: See? It's all about the documentation.
[00:11:35] <artchad> I'm someone who would document everything and write getting started guides and record videos for my stuff, if I expected others to use it.
[00:11:39] <borodust> artchad: whatcha mean, cl-bodge vs gamekit?
[00:12:16] <artchad> jstoddard: mentioned how he appreciates trivial-gamekits documentation, because documentation for other projects is hit or miss.
[00:12:24] <artchad> that was the same reason I started with trivial-gamekit
[00:12:35] <borodust> yup, that was the reason i wrote it for gamekit
[00:12:50] <borodust> for ppl to use it for something light and jammy
[00:13:37] <borodust> there were zero other reasons i wrote it
[00:14:09] <borodust> the whole point of gamekit was a controllable subset cl-bodge that ppl can use ;p
[00:14:24] <borodust> controllable and simplest possible while still be usable
[00:15:07] <borodust> *can be
[00:15:44] <borodust> i'm planning to do similar thing for this new super secret project exactly for the same reason :D

[17:55:47] <artchad> sorry. xD I need to get that off my chest.
[17:56:05] <artchad> and then there are the subtle differences between C and CL.

I've been programming in C and C++, using a bit of OpenGL and Vulkan (just basic stuffs). I saw some game development libraries but most of them doesn't have documentation. Where do you recommend to start?

[21:04:26] <borodust> welcome to #lispgames, Hectarea1996 
[21:05:22] <Hectarea1996> Hi. I'm trying to use IRC, first time using it. I find it very confusing :D
[21:06:41] <borodust> it's okay, it's the gift of the Ancients ;p
[21:06:49] *** Quits: treflip (~user@user/treflip) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[21:08:04] <Hectarea1996> I saw that you made several game development libraries. What do you recommend for starting to learn game development with common lisp?
[21:09:06] <borodust> Hectarea1996: what are your goals?
[21:09:17] <borodust> like, what kind of games, or maybe gamedev tools
[21:09:32] <borodust> 2d or 3d, custom physics, complex physics
[21:10:17] <Hectarea1996> Well, I wanted to do game engines. I want learn a bit of everything, but first graphics stuffs
[21:10:18] <borodust> maybe instead of making actual games, just learning technologies
[21:10:20] <Hectarea1996> And 3d
[21:10:23] <borodust> aha, i see
[21:10:38] <Hectarea1996> I used GLFW and Vulkan in C++
[21:10:50] <Hectarea1996> And a bit of OpenGL and SDL
[21:10:56] <Hectarea1996> But just basic stuff
[21:11:07] <borodust> there are no solid vulkan bindings for CL yet, unfortunately
[21:11:25] <borodust> |3b| has some unfinished ones
[21:11:32] <borodust> well
[21:11:49] <Hectarea1996> I've seen that library
[21:12:01] <Hectarea1996> And also the opengl one
[21:12:14] <borodust> Hectarea1996: i guess, most straightforward way would be going through learnopengl.com  with cl-opengl
[21:12:15] <Hectarea1996> You posted me an issue about that xD
[21:12:18] <borodust> yup
[21:12:45] <borodust> you already have bindings for glfw, so you can go with them
[21:12:51] <Hectarea1996> The problem is there is not documentation
[21:12:58] <borodust> cl-opengl?
[21:13:01] <Hectarea1996> yes
[21:13:43] <Hectarea1996> I see a folder named doc, but has unix files and I couldn't run the makefile
[21:13:57] <borodust> well, it's bindings - you should be able to transcribe OpenGL C examples into CL almost 1-to-1
[21:14:10] <borodust> cl-opengl has examples to get you started
[21:14:37] <borodust> %gl package in particular are raw bindings, meaning it should map 1-to-1 to C examples
[21:15:43] <borodust> i've looked into your glfw repo, looks like you are quite familira with CFFI, so you shouldn't have too many problems with using OpenGL C examples and appying them in CL
[21:16:22] <Hectarea1996> I think so too
[21:16:25] <borodust> so my goto would be cl-opengl examples (to get the feeling) + learnopengl.com
[21:16:33] <Hectarea1996> Nice
[21:16:37] <Hectarea1996> Thank you
[21:16:44] <borodust> no probs!
[21:17:46] <borodust> feel free to shoot any questions here, we will try to help :D
[21:18:10] <Hectarea1996> Ok, thank you! :D
[21:18:38] <borodust> o7
[21:22:51] <borodust> Hectarea1996: ah, btw, i also can recommend game engine architecture book
[21:23:01] <borodust> for, well, looking into how engines work
[21:23:06] <borodust> it's pretty good
[21:24:04] <borodust> i mean, the name is literally "Game Engine Architecture"
[21:25:59] <Hectarea1996> I'll check it out

[22:10:32] <artchad> Borodust: You mean Game Engine Architecture by Jason Gregory?
[22:10:32] <artchad> I have a PDF of that.
[22:20:12] <borodust> yes
[22:20:20] <borodust> i have hard copy ;p
[22:20:27] <borodust> second edition though
[22:26:11] <artchad> I would love to have hard copies of all those great books.
[22:27:11] <artchad> but I'm a man without financial resources like that. If I can survive a months on ~30Euro, then buying a book like that is like half a year of survival.
[22:27:32] <artchad> I ration my money carefully. xD
[22:37:37] <borodust> D:
[22:38:36] <borodust> 30 a month sounds quite tough
