[15:02:39] <linge93[m]> hello！I want to repeat my question,how is the amplitude recovery in ofdm_rx.grc? Because I found the "multiply const" block in ofdm_tx.grc, it is used to control the amplitude of the input USRP to be less than 1, but there seems to be no reverse process at the receiving end. Does anyone know what's going on?

[16:31:27] <Yamakaja[m]> Wait, neither of those are using the USRP sinks, are we talking about the same examples?
[16:31:34] <Yamakaja[m]> s/sinks/blocks/
[16:33:01] <linge93[m]> I think it’s almost the same, because it’s just the "channel model" that has become a real channel generated by USRP.
[16:33:55] <Yamakaja[m]> Ah, so you modified the example?
[16:34:28] <linge93[m]> yes
[16:34:49] <linge93[m]> but The "multiply const" module is also used. Isn't the function of this module used to limit the amplitude?
[16:36:01] <Yamakaja[m]> Well, as far as i can tell the example channel model doesn't modify the amplitude 
[16:36:11] <Yamakaja[m]> Have you tried using an AGC block after your USRP Source?
[16:37:03] <linge93[m]> no
[16:38:53] <linge93[m]> My receiving flow diagram is as follows

[16:39:55] <linge93[m]> I am not sure about the effect of using "multiply const". In addition to limiting the amplitude, what I can think of is that the usrp driver will adjust the amplitude to (-1, 1). I don't know if it is related to this.

[19:23:25] <muaddib[m]> Was thinking i could use the preamble_f block in PDU utils to do that. Is that block hardcoded to only use float data or could it (or one of the other blocks in pdu_utils) be used to append a preamble on the front of an incoming u8vector?

[19:26:35] <Jacob[m]12> that `preamble_f` block is kind of a naming disaster. it accepts U8 PDUs and produces F32 PDUs by necessity. internally it does upsampling, preamble/tail prepending/appending, and NRZ encoding
[19:26:59] <Jacob[m]12> all of those steps are optional, but the block is U8->F32
