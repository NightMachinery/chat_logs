[00:17:13] <re101-zonkey-44> hi
[00:17:14] <re101-zonkey-44> https://regex101.com/r/xWMzjZ/2
[00:17:33] <re101-zonkey-44> I need your help with getting the first character in those values
[00:18:19] <re101-zonkey-44> I have about 300 rows. They have various lengths and number of words. I want to get the first character from each row 
[00:21:03] <purplex> The first number in matches?
[00:21:26] <re101-zonkey-44> The first character 
[00:21:30] <re101-zonkey-44> like: HANGER
[00:21:37] <re101-zonkey-44> or like: ADAPTER 
[00:21:56] <re101-zonkey-44>  I have several words in each row, but I need to get the first word
[00:23:38] <purplex> So, first word. its not a character. Does it occur right after the matches?
[00:25:32] <re101-zonkey-44> yes, first word
[00:25:45] <re101-zonkey-44> each word is in ' '
[00:25:55] <re101-zonkey-44> what do you mean by match?
[00:28:45] <getivan> Yeah, that's why I was seeking Python, at first... I probably allowed them to make it more complicated than it needed to be...
[00:29:39] <getivan> I'm working with these guys for a C++ solution, Purplex, but if you can help me make a Python version that results in an executable, then I'll try that, too... :o 
[00:30:25] <getivan> We've got a working solution, but it needs Visual Studio on each machine... not a big deal, I guess...
[00:31:39] <purplex> re101-zonkey-44: Does that word contain a number?
[00:33:09] <purplex> getivan: It seems path to files will be likely hardcoded with C++ unless you make a .config file, in python you can change it easily.
[00:33:38] <re101-zonkey-44> no
[00:33:41] <re101-zonkey-44> no number
[00:33:59] <re101-zonkey-44> first word could be: HANGER, HOUSING, ADAPTER, SEAL
[00:34:15] <re101-zonkey-44> I want to have a list that give me the first word is listed 
[00:34:39] <purplex> e.g. I can see there's a A707 MAT
[00:43:23] <purplex> The first word contains a number, that's what I am saying, but seems you want 'MAT'
[00:50:44] <re101-zonkey-44> I need the words: HANGER, ADAPTER,HOUSING,SEAL
[00:50:59] <re101-zonkey-44> and there is no number 
[00:52:17] <purplex> Okay, what is this: 30.617", A707 MAT? https://regex101.com/r/xWMzjZ/3

[00:57:19] <purplex> https://regex101.com/r/xWMzjZ/5
[00:58:10] <getivan> Yes, Purplex, I had to download Visual Studio, so that I could compile their code... LoL... do you know Python? Or just saying it's something I should look into? I should probably learn Python, really...
[00:58:17] <purplex> Wait, this is good: https://regex101.com/r/xWMzjZ/6

[01:49:08] <OnlineCop> re101-dodo-34: First, you need to have some text you want to search. Second, you need to know what you want to find in the text (search only? search and replace?)
[01:50:24] <OnlineCop> re101-kiwi-55: I would need to see a bunch of examples to know what you're trying to accomplish: URLs that match, URLs that clearly shouldn't match, and URLs that you want to exclude (like 'autori/foo/' or 'autori/page/' or whatever).

[07:43:51] <Nathan22> digitok, I realized my idea was kind of misguided, as the Java regex engine doesn't support multiple named groups regardless. But basically, I was hoping to predefine named groups that show up often, then use those to create a complex pattern using those components. I realized I actually just needed string variables to refer to reuse smaller regex strings
[07:47:13] <digitok> right, regex does allow that, but it isn't supported in java
[07:47:52] <digitok> it lacks the recursion/subroutine feature needed to call the groups
[07:57:20] <Me-me> You know what's silly? Java 4 had recursion, but subsequent ones don't.
[07:58:29] <digitok> yep
[07:58:37] <digitok> probably didn't work properly so they just removed it

[21:00:53] <purplex> ham5urg: There's a 'u' flag in python, for \p{L} you can write [^\W\d_] for example, excludes all non-words, digits (including unicode) and _ and leaves unicode letters. I use 'regex' module not sure why you're not.
