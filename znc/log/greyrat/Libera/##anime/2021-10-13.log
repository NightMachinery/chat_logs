[00:33:27] <Matt|home> i read somewhere that humans evolved to find basic foods repulsive (try sticking a bar of soap in your mouth) because a lot of poisons during that period in our evolution were very basic, mainly from plants - so it's a survival mechanism. but still it's hard to eat healthy.. you just can't beat sugar + salt + fat combo in terms of reward pathways

[03:54:18] <SpiritOfSummer> ButterNoodle: when I dated the first girl that wasn't completely skinny my friends made fun of me
[03:54:31] <SpiritOfSummer> the thing is that's not that odd considering they know my thing is skinny girls
[03:54:53] <SpiritOfSummer> but the one thing I had to say to them is at least there's some fucking weight now when my face is being fucking ridden
[03:55:27] <trog> after I dated the first not skinny girl, I never saw skinny women quite the same
[03:56:32] <ButterNoodle> SpiritOfSummer: u never been whale'n?
[03:56:55] <ButterNoodle> I do like to take the lil girls for a spin...
[03:57:00] <SpiritOfSummer> ButterNoodle: i was on top for that
[03:57:18] <trog> idk with skinny women now its just like there's something missing
[03:57:27] <SpiritOfSummer> trog: you don't know the ones I know
[03:57:35] <trog> I grab for it and it's not there for another inch or two
[03:57:44] <trog> a thicc chicc fills it out
[03:57:54] <ButterNoodle> so u've never been smothered in fat fucking thighs questioning whether u were gonna make it out of that sexscapade?
[03:57:54] <SpiritOfSummer> you're not from where I'm from
[03:58:04] <SpiritOfSummer> ButterNoodle: i dodged it
[03:58:08] <trog> whatever that means
[03:58:10] <SpiritOfSummer> I specifically made sure she laid down first
[03:58:19] <ButterNoodle> turn in ur man card
[03:58:29] <SpiritOfSummer> im not joking this was my drunken 2015 self just trying to survive
[03:58:37] <ButterNoodle> if u havent almost died from sex, you havent done it right yet
[03:58:41] <SpiritOfSummer> i was fuckin 20 dude

[04:01:29] <SpiritOfSummer> no for sure
[04:01:40] <SpiritOfSummer> probably if i was a bit older and less drunk i woulda went for it
[04:01:58] <SpiritOfSummer> ButterNoodle: but how much making out, eating out, and missionary sex I got to have that night
[04:02:02] <SpiritOfSummer> I was satisfied at 20
[04:02:10] <ButterNoodle> I'd fuck a fat girl before I'd give her a ride on my motorcycle thats for sure
[04:02:25] <SpiritOfSummer> for some reason I didn't let her blow me
[04:02:30] <SpiritOfSummer> I forgot why I didn't want that
[04:02:48] <ButterNoodle> cant get em too fat, they have a hard time getting over the armrest to give road head
[04:03:06] <SpiritOfSummer> well she was older than me and had done more stuff so 
[04:03:19] <SpiritOfSummer> I was kind of trying to make sure she didn't start doign some nasty shit
[04:03:26] <SpiritOfSummer> I didn't know what else she had done but I was scared to find out
[04:03:43] <ButterNoodle> ever had a rusty trombone?
[04:03:57] <SpiritOfSummer> but I only ever did one night with that girl and it was because my friend forced me to

[13:23:53] <Cryowolf> Anyone know any movies similar to Chronicle or Unhealer? Where someone weak and bullied (whether late teenager or adult), gets some supernatural power and revenge on those who wronged him. I'm not looking for a hero here, no fuqn Spiderman. Closer to villain, like border between anti-hero and anti-villain. Brutal, satisfying vengeance stuff. Preferably a live-action movie, but I can go with anime too. I don't really want the opponent 
[13:23:53] <Cryowolf> to gain super powers at all. I don't want there to be a "final battle" of the titans
[13:24:15] <Cryowolf> most I'm gonna accept is a Chronicle "battle" ^^

[13:52:43] <DunceCotus> gay cooties

[13:55:29] <DunceCotus> Lobsters pee out of their faces. They have urine-release nozzles right under their eyes. They urinate in each other's faces as a way of communicating, either when fighting or mating.

[13:56:23] <Cryowolf> They should make body horror with that, except instead of Urine, it's acid

[16:34:32] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: oh not this shite again
[16:34:42] <darkwitch> ok, but the music doesn't sound like enka, not that I know anything about enka really
[16:34:58] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: that's a translation thing agreed in America
[16:35:10] <DunceCotus> enka = old lady wailing?
[16:35:21] <amigojapan> Alright darkwitch sorry
[16:35:31] <DunceCotus> angels is better than apostles
[16:35:41] <DunceCotus> packs more of a punch.. apostles is like.. mreh
[16:36:07] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it was changed cause they were scared of Christians
[16:36:17] <DunceCotus> when you think about it the Evangelion mythos makes 0 sense
[16:36:41] <DunceCotus> but what makes it work is they run with the nonsense, develop it into aesthetic bliss
[16:37:12] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: so is it actually angels in japanese?
[16:37:23] <DunceCotus> but it was intended to be apostles initially?
[16:37:48] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: the song is but the show says appostles shitou
[16:38:02] <DunceCotus> I beg your pardon
[16:38:20] <amigojapan> Shitou is apostle
[16:38:28] <amigojapan> In Japanese
[16:38:40] <amigojapan> Tenshi is angel
[16:38:44] <DunceCotus> O_O
[16:38:59] <amigojapan> The song says tenshi
[16:39:07] <amigojapan> But not the show

[17:15:08] <DunceCotus> but Anno was so meticulous with the production
[17:15:15] <DunceCotus> they went through like 8 rewrites at least
[17:15:30] <DunceCotus> and most of the film was made in like the last year or two iirc from the documentary

[17:18:27] <DunceCotus> more time to finish scenes etc.
[17:18:39] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[17:18:44] <DunceCotus> sure it also pushed back release date

[17:19:28] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I did not get the very end. They were in a live action world
[17:19:34] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: and Anno wouldn't have submitted a half-finished product
[17:19:48] <DunceCotus> he'd sooner rather let the past 10 years or whatever go to waste
[17:20:17] <DunceCotus> or maybe incorporated the scenes of the film in other stuff down the line I guess 
[17:20:28] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: he should not have allowed CG
[17:20:38] <DunceCotus> true they overdid it with the CG
[17:20:49] <DunceCotus> I didn't mind the fourth wall breaking stuff
[17:20:59] <DunceCotus> that stuff was in original anime and EoE etc.

[19:22:44] <MootPoot> well, yes and no Roey ; afaik usb 4.0 is just thunderbolt at 40gbps
[19:22:55] <MootPoot> you have to have usb 4.0 plus the 200w powder delivery standard
[19:23:06] <Roey> ohhhhh, ok.
[19:23:09] <MootPoot> 200w is not inherent in every usb 4 implementation
[19:23:24] <MootPoot> Roey: you can expect only 1 port on a device to actually accept the charging
[19:23:33] <MootPoot> and all the other charge ports as data only
[19:23:34] <Roey> MootPoot: ALSO -- does this mean that /any/ USB 4 port supports Thunderbolt, or just /specifically-marked/ USB 4 ports?
[19:23:44] <Roey> MootPoot: AHhhhhhahahahahahah okay so that's what I was asking
[19:23:45] <Roey> heh
[19:23:48] <MootPoot> USB 4 and thunderbolt is the same thing
[19:23:57] <MootPoot> now
[19:24:15] <MootPoot> well, usb 4 and thunderbolt 3 
[19:24:16] <Roey> whereas before it was only specially-marked USB ports
[19:24:22] <MootPoot> but now its all just usb 4
[19:24:25] <Roey> ok
[19:24:58] <Roey> so for driving a 4k monitor at 144hz + power, would that 200W and 20 GB/s be enough?
[19:24:59] <MootPoot> so you're gonna get a laptop with say 4 usb C ports, it'll probably be something like 2 ports are usb 4, and 1 can accept power
[19:25:09] <Roey> sur
[19:25:11] <Roey> sure*
[19:25:13] <MootPoot> and the other would be data
[19:25:17] <MootPoot> oly
[19:25:30] <MootPoot> and the other 2 would probably be usb 3.2 gen 2, or also data only usb 4 ports
[19:25:47] <Matt|home> thanks Jigsy that's.. unhelpful..
[19:25:49] <MootPoot> my macbook air has a similar setup; it has 2 usb c thunderbolt ports
[19:25:50] <Matt|home> ugh..
[19:26:07] <MootPoot> both work at 40gbps but only 1 accepts power to charge
[19:26:40] <MootPoot> Roey:  afaik you can power the monitor with it, but even 40gbit from usb 4 / thunderbolt 3 is not enugh
[19:26:51] <Roey> ok
[19:26:59] <MootPoot> I have a 4k 144hz monitor

[20:50:59] <Sxem> i bet modern games let you scale the font
[20:51:41] <Bco1981> scale or zoom, does not make much difference when you make things bigger to be able to see things on the screen.
[20:51:45] <Sxem> especially with 4k and whatnot now. at 4k text is super tiny unless they let you make it huge
[20:52:02] <MootPoot> yes, but you still get the clarity of 4k at the edges
