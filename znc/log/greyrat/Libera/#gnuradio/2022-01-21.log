[03:27:51] <Darth_Vader> Hey, I'm looking for some advice regarding gnuradio and my sdr. Running my gnuradio design gives an output stating "Please update the firmware and FPGA images for your device. Expected FPGA compatibility number 11, but got 9: The FPGA build is not compatible with the host code build. Please run: /usr/local/lib/uhd/utils/uhd_images_downloader.py
[03:27:52] <Darth_Vader> and /usr/local/bin/uhd_image_loader --args="type=usrp2, addr=192.168.10.2"". Despite running the two commands, updating my fpga image, I still get the same output. Any suggestions would be helpful?

[17:47:10] <warnes[m]> Hi All, I'm working on a modification of OFDM and and would like to integrate it into an existing comm system (e.g. LTE, WiFi, CBRS, ..) using a BladeRF xA9.   Any recommendation for software that would make it easy to swap out a few system components (FEC, Precoder, etc.) and that would work with a BladeRF xA9?
[17:47:32] <warnes[m]> * BladeRF xA9 for testing.   Any
[17:49:09] <jholtom> warnes[m]: https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Basic_OFDM_Tutorial
[17:49:25] <jholtom> seems like the basic OFDM blocks here could be modified and adapted as you need here....
[17:49:47] <jholtom> and it definitely works with a bladeRF xA9 since its just normal GR and the bladeRF has working source/sinks
[17:52:04] <warnes[m]> jholtom: That's where I've started.  I'm looking to integrate the changes I've built here into a more complete stack.
[17:55:43] <jholtom> You mean like the network layer?
[17:56:14] <jholtom> If you've started there and built it up, you've got most of the PHY
[17:56:27] <jholtom> Custom complete stack?
[17:56:38] <warnes[m]> Yes.  So that I end up with something like a WiFi router & client
[17:57:05] <warnes[m]> I only want to modify the PHY layer, leaving everything else as-is.
[17:57:36] <muaddib[m]> Have you seen gr-ieee80211?
[17:57:48] <jholtom> yeah, I was about to link that
[17:57:50] <jholtom> warnes[m]: https://github.com/bastibl/gr-ieee802-11
[17:58:05] <jholtom> you might check out this, and just modifiy Bastian's OFDM PHY Hierarchal block
[17:58:09] <jholtom> he notes where it is in the README
[17:58:45] <warnes[m]> Sounds great!  I'll look into gr-ieee802-11.   
[17:59:04] <warnes[m]> Any comments on `bladerf-wiphy`?
[17:59:39] <jholtom> its in VHDL, not GNURadio
[17:59:49] <jholtom> so then you have to really motivate yourself to adapt your changes into VHDL
[18:00:02] <jholtom> it removes a bunch of the network layer/mac layer stuff though by using the linux drivers for it
[18:00:05] <warnes[m]> True, and I don't yet want to tackle VHDL.
[18:00:32] <jholtom> so to be perfectly honest, using the linux drivers for the mac80211 stuff is brilliant
[18:00:37] <jholtom> it saves an enormous amount of effort
[18:00:56] <jholtom> you could theoretically do it with GR too, but its trickier since you'll pay a lot for those userspace kernel copies and stuff
[18:01:59] <warnes[m]> I played with `bladerf-wiphy` to test my HW.  I have it almost working, with some issue in routing packets...
[18:03:31] <jholtom> well thats at the mac layer, so probably just some bizarre kernel setting :P
[18:03:43] <warnes[m]> Eventually, I would like to end up using a pair (set?) of  'stand-alone' devices that look to the client system like 802.11 network adaptors.
[18:03:43] <warnes[m]>   
[18:04:31] <jholtom> why not just buy actual 802.11 adapters?
[18:04:50] <jholtom> oh wait, you want your stuff to look like 802.11 but actually do something different and new
[18:05:01] <warnes[m]> Exactly!
[18:05:04] <jholtom> are you doing ad-hoc networking or are you actually trying to do a STA?
[18:05:17] <warnes[m]> STA?
[18:05:25] <jholtom> station
[18:05:30] <muaddib[m]> Yea, he said he  wants to modify the phy layer. Otherwise I 100% agree with you
[18:06:03] <jholtom> warnes[m]: like you broadcast an SSID and they join a network and the adapters are served by a single cerntral radio (this is 802.11 sta)
[18:06:21] <warnes[m]> Yes. 
[18:06:32] <muaddib[m]> I dint remember if gr-ieee802.11 was fast enough to do that
[18:06:40] <warnes[m]> I suspect not..
[18:07:12] <muaddib[m]> It could do full transmit and receive but there was an issue at one point making it a client or AP
[18:07:23] <warnes[m]> So I figure I'll end up needing to do /some/ coding for the FPGA, but I'm hoping to keep that as small as possible.
[18:07:25] <muaddib[m]> s/client/STA/
[18:07:27] <jholtom> no, it is not
[18:07:37] <jholtom> gr 802.11 can't be a STA yet
[18:07:43] <jholtom> and nor can bladerf-wiphy
[18:08:03] <warnes[m]> Actually, bladerf-wiphy seems to talk to my phone just fine, modulo the routing issue.
[18:08:31] <jholtom> but its acting as a client, not a STA
[18:08:44] <jholtom> actually wait
[18:08:47] <jholtom> it can b ea SAT
[18:08:49] <warnes[m]> No, it's acting ass an STA, broadcasting SSID, etc.
[18:08:51] <jholtom> because its not doing any of the STA ops
[18:08:55] <jholtom> its the linux kernel doing them
[18:08:56] <jholtom> duh
[18:09:15] <warnes[m]> Yep.
[18:09:18] <jholtom> warnes[m]: yeah if you want to do this, you're definitely best off learning VHDL
[18:09:27] <jholtom> you've done your changes in GR and tested them right?
[18:09:42] <jholtom> can you describe your changes in more depth?
[18:10:00] <jholtom> did I meet you at GRCon?
[18:10:11] <warnes[m]> Yes, we met at GRCon.
[18:10:37] <warnes[m]> I would be delighted to discuss the changes in greater depth... under and NDA
[18:11:22] <jholtom> sorry I am horrible at putting names to screen names
[18:11:31] <warnes[m]>  * I would be _delighted_ to discuss the changes in greater depth... 
[18:11:31] <warnes[m]> under an NDA
[18:11:37] <jholtom> and I just moved around my business card collection lol
[18:11:47] <warnes[m]> No problem, I was having trouble connecting you as well..
[18:12:11] <warnes[m]> Move to private chat?
[18:13:50] <jholtom> you're welcome to message me on Matrix privately @jholtom:grandcanyon.holtom.me
[18:13:56] <jholtom> I don't have that matrix linked to this channel
[18:14:18] <jholtom> warnes[m]: but there are some interesting things to be still discussed in public
[18:14:27] <jholtom> for example, we can talk very easily about the FEC substution in VHDL
[18:14:33] <jholtom> since you mentioned that earlier
[18:14:54] <jholtom> I'm not a huge VHDL guy, I know Verilog better, but the concepts extend
[18:15:14] <warnes[m]> That would be very helpful.
[18:15:47] <jholtom> oh lol
[18:15:51] <jholtom> their MATLAB stuff isn't very filled out
[18:16:01] <jholtom> I have a good reference for that if you think it helpful
[18:16:10] <jholtom> https://warpproject.org/trac/wiki/WARPLab/Examples/OFDM
[18:16:21] <jholtom> it only does the true lowest layers of the PHY (modcod) no FEC
[18:17:14] <jholtom> but bladerf-wiphy is a few extra bits around it, but their MATLAB script is missing the rather easy synchronization tools
[18:18:28] <jholtom> alright, we're going to step one down from FEC because I don't wanna do Viterbi this early in the morning
[18:18:33] <jholtom> lets talk interleavers
[18:19:52] <jholtom> warnes[m]: do for example, 802.11 sets out one interleaving pattern, and you decide you can do better (idk maybe, I don't actually know what it looks like)
[18:19:57] <warnes[m]> I think I can actually do away with FEC by using my encoding, so that may make life easier.
[18:20:17] <jholtom> yeah
[18:20:28] <jholtom> but I'm really just going after your first changes to perhaps try in bladerf-wiphy
[18:20:33] <jholtom> assuming you have two bladerfs to work with
[18:20:43] <jholtom> since once you tweak it, it becomes incompatible with your phone :P
[18:21:19] <jholtom> but the easiest thing might be the interleaver
[18:21:25] <jholtom> you could just start by changing the generated table here: https://github.com/Nuand/bladeRF-wiphy/blob/main/fpga/vhdl/wlan_interleaver_p.vhd
[18:21:31] <warnes[m]> Yes, my intent is to start by changing as little as possible.
[18:21:53] <jholtom> have you already proved your scheme in GR on just the PHY side?
[18:22:16] <jholtom> you want to have some sort of reference to compare any HDL work against either in C or something like it
[18:22:34] <warnes[m]> Did that in MATLAB, now thinking of moving to GNUradio for the next steps.
[18:22:41] <jholtom> ah okay
[18:22:51] <jholtom> so yeah, I'm putting the cart before the horse
[18:23:03] <warnes[m]> Absolutely..
[18:23:04] <jholtom> I would adapt what you've done, and go over the air in GR just modifying the existing OFDM blocks
[18:23:11] <jholtom> so just a PHY still
[18:23:25] <jholtom> and then come back to bladerf-wiphy when you've puts bits over that PHY in GR
[18:23:27] <warnes[m]> Nod.
[18:23:36] <warnes[m]> That's actually today's task.
[18:23:42] <jholtom> it'll become a month :)
[18:23:54] <warnes[m]> I hope not! 😛
[18:23:55] <jholtom> making bits go over the air can be kinda hard when its a new scheme lol
[18:25:24] <jholtom> I like to think I'm pretty good at experimental comms techniques, but testing out new algorithsm on the air is always tricky and more challenging than we anticipate.  So the reality is I'm not that good and real physical radios always humbles me and my simulations
[18:25:25] <warnes[m]> At the moment, I only have one bladeRF, but it has two RX and two TX channels, so I'm going to do round-trip with one device.  
[18:25:32] <jholtom> yep, that is a good plan!
[18:25:52] <warnes[m]> This should also make easier to calculate BER etc.

[18:28:46] <warnes[m]> I have a OFDM loopback grc flowchart that works OK when I pass it through a channel model, but doesn't when I route it through the bladeRF.
[18:29:04] <warnes[m]> (unmodified OFDM)
[18:30:36] <jholtom> thats the first place to start :)
[18:34:00] <muaddib[m]> Yeah, even doing things in a vacuum (cabled) there’s still all kind of fundamental RF and environmental artifacts/errors that still take me a while to get right.
[18:35:58] <jholtom> SDR dynamic range is a shockingly tricky thing to get right
[18:36:05] <jholtom> That's the one that always kicks my butt
[18:36:19] <jholtom> Is either numerically or physical gain setups just don't give me the dynamic range I'm expecting lol

[19:02:18] <muaddib[m]> Hah. we were in the middle of talking about modulations and RF stuff. I was trying to make a modulation scheme out of AFK
[19:02:29] <jholtom> i mean you totally could
[19:02:55] <jholtom> could've just been a miskey of ASK or something
[19:03:01] <jholtom> or a brand new Amplitude-Frequency Keying :P
[19:03:28] <jholtom> oh you could probably call APSK AFK if you were feeling wild
[19:04:00] <muaddib[m]> Don’t forget about AFSK
[19:04:08] <muaddib[m]> Like for APRS
[19:05:04] <jholtom> oh yeah
[19:09:10] <warnes[m]> I'm back.
[19:09:45] <warnes[m]> Yeah, AFK = Asymmetric Frequency Keying..
[19:09:56] <Crofton[m]> I shoudl time stamp messages and see how accurate your time is
[19:10:08] <warnes[m]> It wasn't very..
[19:10:22] <warnes[m]> Off by about 2\pi as usual.
[19:11:26] <warnes[m]> Aside:  My project time estimation algorithm is :  (estimate)*2  * pi:
[19:11:27] <warnes[m]> * 2 for estimation error
[19:11:27] <warnes[m]> * pi for running around in circles
[19:11:27] <warnes[m]> !!
[19:13:19] <muaddib[m]> Haha
[19:13:26] <muaddib[m]> I’m using that in the future
[19:14:18] <muaddib[m]> Although pi would only get you half way around the unit circle :)
[19:14:57] <warnes[m]> Depends on if your using the radius or the diameter as you're starting point...
[19:15:55] <warnes[m]> s/you're/your/
[19:18:07] <muaddib[m]> If you’re using the diameter you’re in 2 places at once. If you’ve figured out how to work on 2 parts of a project at the same time I’d love to know about that. Would save me time.

[20:16:38] <Notou[m]> To stop, just close the QT window. To pause and start is possible, but you would need some shenanigans, making a block that can be called by the button, and use snippets to give it a reference to the top_block object that has the start and pause functions.
[20:18:54] <warnes[m]> Notou: Closing the QT window doesn't always stop the flowgraph from executing, and I'm having to kill the process, so I'm looking for a cleaner way.
[20:20:49] <Notou[m]> I don't believe you could get a better result than that by calling functions from inside the QT loop, since that is already what closing the window does
[20:21:55] <Notou[m]> Closing the window terminates the QT loop, and calls the function to stop the flowgraph
[20:23:21] <warnes[m]> I think I may need to stop the SDR sink & source somehow...
[20:23:30] <muaddib[m]> Yea, it sounds like an issue in your graph.

[22:45:50] <nick40[m]> I'm trying to an upconvertion from a FM broadcast to VHF (144MHz). I'm using WBFM receive block from the source (FM broadcast) conected directly to the NBFM transmit sink (VHF 144MHz) but I get lots of "aU" and the audio gets cut, any idea why this could be?
[22:48:00] <patchvonbraun[m]> Sorry, I don't see where the audio subsystem is involved in such a scheme.  Could you share your flow-graph?  Also, I'll point out that rebroadcasting a commercial broadcast service on the amateur-radio service is illegal in most jurisdictions.

[22:49:25] <nick40[m]> dont worry about the legality, where I live nobody cares about that
[22:51:29] <patchvonbraun[m]> Your graph displays considerable confusion about sample rates and decimation.    For example 2.8Msps/7 != 384K, and so on.
[22:52:37] <nick40[m]> yes, I'm new at this. I've had Pluto for 2 days now
[22:53:36] <Yamakaja[m]> You REALLY don't want to be transmitting with a pluto unless you know what you're doing. They use square wave LOs!
[22:54:17] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yamakaja: It's an AD936x -- same as USRP B2xx, and BladeRF.    
[22:54:41] <Yamakaja[m]> patchvonbraun: Yes?
[22:54:44] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yamakaja: Square-wave LO is exceedingly common, particularly when you're using a 2XLO mixer.
[22:55:01] <nick40[m]> so the sample rate from the source divided by the decimation in the low pass filter has to mach the quadrature rate from the WBFM receiver?
[22:55:31] <Yamakaja[m]> Well, the pluto lacks the output filters to clean that signal up - you'll huge harmonics in places you'd rather not :/
[22:55:38] <Yamakaja[m]> * - you'll get huge harmonics
[22:56:03] <patchvonbraun[m]> nick40: Yes, and the output of the demodulator has to match the rate of your audio sink.  Gnu Radio doesn't magically do those conversions for you, because that would imply that it "knows" what it is you're trying to do, and as with any other programming environment, it cannot possibly...
[22:57:29] <drmpeg> Yamakaja[m] A B210 isn't exactly great. https://www.w6rz.net/harmonic.png
[22:58:00] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yamakaja: USRP, BladeRF also don't have any output filters to speak of.  The output signal quality is reasonably good.  But it is the case that ANY ready-to-rock-and-roll TX chain (particularly in a type-acceptance-required environment) will require output filters to meet the specific requirements of whatever type-acceptance is inplay.

[23:00:04] <nick40[m]> ok, so I need a low pass filter from the NBFM block to the Pluto sink, am I right?
[23:01:10] <Yamakaja[m]> nick40: The filtering i'm talking about needs to happen in hardware. The square wave harmonics mean that your signal will appear on all odd multiples of your LO frequency, with an amplitude proportional to 1/k of that multiples index
[23:01:16] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yamakaja: It is true of just about ANY "naked" LO+mixer+RF-amp chain.  None of those components will be "perfect", and those small imperfections lead to unwanted spectral components.  It was ever thus.  Expecting SDRs to magically make this not true is fantasy.
[23:01:40] <Yamakaja[m]> Well, but they could be using non-square wave LOs, no?
[23:01:41] <patchvonbraun[m]> nick40: Please spend some time with the GNu Radio tutorials, particularly the basic DSP ones.

[23:02:33] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yamakaja: That's actually a bit of a red-herring.   Mixers work by basically switching diodes on and off--they're quantizing internally whether you feed them square-waves or sine-waves.  
[23:02:35] <Yamakaja[m]> Nvm, the AD9361 squares up input LOs internally
[23:03:24] <patchvonbraun[m]> For a 2XLO mixer, you need them a bit squarer, but diode mixers basically act as switches internally.
[23:03:53] <Yamakaja[m]> Oh well, i've never really spent much time with USRPs, but always thought of them as the "good radios" with proper filtering ... apparently that's not the case :D
[23:04:18] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yamakaja: Many of the USRPs DO have switchable filters in both paths.  
[23:04:47] <patchvonbraun[m]> But the problem becomes "where do you put the band edges for filters when the device covers 50MHz to 6GHz?"
[23:05:12] <Yamakaja[m]> Yeah, you'd need retunable filters or a large filterbank ...

[23:06:20] <patchvonbraun[m]> So, you end up with switchable filter banks
[23:06:47] <patchvonbraun[m]> Which means if you are an SDR designer, you end up making educated guesses about where your users want the fitler band edges.

[23:10:03] <Jacob[m]12> some usrps dont have filtering (e.g.: b2xx)

[23:12:13] <Yamakaja[m]> * pluto -> **TX** antenna ->
[23:13:17] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yamakaja: Depends on the spurious-emissions requirements of the service they're deployed in, and whether the user is placing more gain stages, etc.  If you're only putting out 5dBm and your spurious are 30dB down from that, that may be acceptable.  
[23:14:26] <Yamakaja[m]> Oh sure, in a full rf system you can make them work. I just don't like the thought of people connecting antennas to them and just spewing all over the spectrum while playing around with fm broadcasts :P

[23:49:46] <Yamakaja[m]> s/our/your/
[23:49:59] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yeah, pretty much.
[23:50:17] <Yamakaja[m]> And i assume what they're doing is completely legal?
[23:50:36] <patchvonbraun[m]> I was there testing a GR-based riometer design, but I couldn't get any decent data from it.   Moved to different parts of the Island to get away from it.  Not possible.
[23:51:00] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yamakaja: I think they are under jurisdication of the FCC, but there's only a couple of license-compliance officers for the entire place...
[23:51:27] <patchvonbraun[m]> Arecibo themselves didn't really care about anything below about 150MHz
[23:52:40] <Yamakaja[m]> I see :/
[23:53:53] <patchvonbraun[m]> But hey, at least I get to say I did science at Arecibo a few years before it collapsed...
[23:54:19] <patchvonbraun[m]> The beaches and iguanas were cool, too :)

[23:59:24] <muaddib[m]> I learned about Arecibo from Lavar Burton on Reading Rainbow in the 80s!
