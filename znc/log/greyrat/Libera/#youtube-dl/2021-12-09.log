[14:46:43] <nimaje> yes; I don't know, what details do you want to see?
[14:55:11] <clarkk> nimaje, ok, that's not so important. What about my first question?
[14:55:33] <clarkk> currently, I'm doing it like this  xargs -rd'\n' youtube-dl < list.txt
[14:56:05] <clarkk> would be nice to do it like, youtube-dl -i list.txt
[14:56:41] <clarkk> although -i is being used. Maybe -in ?
[15:01:37] <nimaje> how about reading the man page / --help text / readme instead of guessing options? as in some (many?) other programs that file is named batch-file from batch processing
[15:03:43] <gnoo> clarkk: LESS='+/FILE' man youtube-dl  , it's a few "n" keys away
[15:04:44] *** Joins: x73 (~x73@user/x73)
[15:05:53] <clarkk> there's no need for the snark.  I was reading the github readme. Is it any different. It's long, and I didn't know what word to search for. If it had had the word "list" in the description, I would have found it
[15:06:36] <clarkk> but thank you. I assumed this was a channel where people were happy to help. Is this not the case?

[15:07:56] *** Joins: arch3r (~ben@185.66.194.78)
[15:07:57] <gnoo> there's lots of information on man pages. it's useful if you get used to searching it first. those pages are usually in similar formats
[15:12:00] <clarkk> gnoo, yes, and I'm using  --get-format, -F, -f '18' options to solve my problem. Don't automatically assume that no-one reads the manual.
[15:13:38] <gnoo> "get used to searching man pages" -> "you never read it" . idk how you translate from one to another. 
[15:14:32] <gnoo> especially since /FILE shows what you should normally search. uppercase letters for option arguments (gnu convention) / for searching and then press 'n' until something looks familiar
[15:14:46] <gnoo> if you don't get a hit, try with all lowercase. and so on
[15:15:25] <clarkk> gnoo, I did that, in the browser on github.  Same information, isn't it?
[15:16:05] <gnoo> is it? does what i said above sound like a advice for searching webpages? or gh readmes?
[15:17:10] <gnoo> man pages are already installed, in a nice format and don't need a browser just to view them. use them first
[15:18:37] <clarkk> gnoo, that's an assumption. man pages for youtube-dl is not installed on my system. I'm running from the binary in the github releases
[15:19:05] <nimaje> the man page and --help text are better for searching an option than the readme; and searching for file FILE or batch would have found the option pretty fast so it seemed like you didn't search for it first
[15:19:50] <gnoo> clarkk: then use --help | less as if it was a man page. nearly the same thing
[15:21:13] <clarkk> nimaje, if I'd known I should be searching for "batch" instead of list. I didn't think of it. What are you going to do? People are fallible. As I said, I have found other options I needed, far more advanced than simply using a file as input
[15:23:53] <clarkk> the description in --help is exactly the same as in the github readme. I imagine they source the same file. In this instance, there's no difference searching either of them.
[15:25:54] <clarkk> Next time I'll know to search for the word "batch" instead of "list". I couldn't think of any others at the time, so I asked here. I think you both are missing the point. The community would be much friendlier if you didn't just tell people to RTFM
[15:30:15] <nimaje> you could indicate that you failed to search for that option, while I can understand searching for 'list', 'file' feels way more natural to search for (you would only have got the second sentence if I assumed you were failing to find the option)

[15:37:03] <clarkk> nimaje, there are 146 occurences of the string "file".  As I said, it's a big manual and difficult to find what I was looking for. Shoot me (as you did). Anyway, thanks for helping with the solution (although it would have been nicer without the snark)
