[20:26:33] <JB[m]> I could really use some help
[20:27:14] <AryaK[m]> idt you can unoverride it because you effectively overwrote the main file
[20:27:19] <AryaK[m]> so dont touch anything in the fs
[20:27:20] <AryaK[m]> is the best bet
[20:27:40] <AryaK[m]> and try some file recovery software
[20:29:34] <JB[m]> AryaK[m]: shouldn't it move the file containing data somewhere
[20:30:08] <JB[m]> now its just a smol file
[20:31:01] <JB[m]> does symbolic store elsewhere in filesystem 
[20:31:01] <JB[m]> if i rm rf both files , will that remain in filesystem anywhere?
[20:31:21] <JB[m]> * does symbolic link store elsewhere
