[05:56:59] <kakuhen> I know that Gnus was originally supposed to work with newsgroups and snoozenet -- but I've heard it can be modified to function as a e-mail client.
[05:57:11] <bpalmer> I have used gnus in the past as an email client, and liked it, but don't currently.
[05:57:52] <bpalmer> It's not an *enormous* amount of configuration, but parts can be a bit intricate.

[05:58:15] <fsbot> [3] <aidalgol> One of the greatest things about Gnus is that it's hackable; one of the most annoying things about Gnus is that it's a hack

[05:58:16] <fsbot> [5] If gnus is frozen for an hour, resist the urge to hit C-g. It will eat your mail one of these days.

[06:02:06] <bpalmer> gnus is really flexible

[06:03:09] <bpalmer> well, to me it seems plausible that there's an issue. But that's why I wouldn't configure gnus to do the moving of data around itself.

[07:09:49] <Teknikal_Domain> That's what I thought
[07:09:54] <Teknikal_Domain> I was mildly confused
[07:09:58] <Wafficus> What I disliked about Luke is that he had that video where he asked for people to prove him wrong
[07:10:01] <Wafficus> and he never tried it out
[07:10:08] <Wafficus> that's why I respect DistroTube slightly more
[07:10:10] <johnjay> dale: i'm trying to look at flyspell and i don't think it does what i want because it uses ispell for everything.
[07:10:19] <eliasy> I am totally outside these mechanical keyboard trends. I really love laptop keyboards. Currently typing on a Lenovo. I like low action keys, can type faster.
[07:10:27] <Wafficus> but yeah Doom Emacs isn't too much better. Its cool for 2 weeks, but its better to just steal the ideas for a personal config using Uncle Dave's Emacs videos
[07:10:43] <johnjay> basically what i want is something similar to dabbrev where it uses another buffer as a source of words for spell-checking but i don't see how to do that with flyspell
[07:10:47] <Wafficus> yeah I can honestly say... I wish I got one of those split keyboards, learned my lesson
[07:11:02] <bkhl> eliasy, I did end up getting a mechanical keyboard lately, but was pretty keen actually on the desktop version of the Lenovo Thinkpad keyboards.
[07:11:08] <johnjay> the intention is to load a buffer with say a list of functions and then have mispellings of them be highlighted in the current buffer.

[07:11:31] <Wafficus> I want an X230 so bad
[07:11:38] <Wafficus> because of Coreboot + SKULLZ

[07:11:52] <Wafficus> that's how BIOS replacement should always be
[07:12:04] <homerj> the only way to configure emacs is to use it for 20 years and randomly toss crap in your .emacs file
[07:12:10] <Teknikal_Domain> And it's painful, low-height keys don't have enough travel for my stupidly heavy lead fingers
[07:12:46] <bkhl> sachac, I had that one as my work machine, then X250 and now the Carbon X1. My general feeling is that those have had roughly the same level of usability with smaller and smaller dimensions.
[07:13:22] <bkhl> sachac, my only annoyance is that I wasn't able to get the low-res version here in Thailand last time I upgraded my work laptop, so now I have a HDPI and have to deal with all that.
[07:13:23] <eliasy> bkhl, I am currently on the second generation for this laptop. The first one had a problem on the mod (Windows) key, and since I use i3, that made my life impossible haha. But they are confortable and seems pretty durable overall.
[07:13:44] <homerj> Teknikal_Domain: yeah, if I wanted a low travel keyboard, I'd get some call glass keyboard like I'm in Star Trek

[07:14:28] <johnjay> i'm looking at dabbrev now but i'm not sure if i can change it
[07:14:31] <eliasy> Teknikal_Domain: yeah, Luke hates emacs. I started on vim, but emacs + evil + ecossystem is just unstoppable.
[07:14:41] <sachac> johnjay: hmm, that sounds interesting
[07:14:54] <johnjay> sachac: well i use dabbrev now for that
[07:15:03] <Teknikal_Domain> I use emacs and vim almost equally, now I can confuse both sides
[07:15:05] <johnjay> i just load a buffer with the API i'm using then it autocompletes
[07:15:17] <sachac> ispell-change-dictionary?
[07:15:23] <bkhl> To be fair I've pretty much done no work travel since I got the Carbon one, for obvious reasons, so have barely used it without external keyboard/monitor
[07:15:57] <johnjay> maybe. but on windows ispell doesn't exist and it's calling to an external process

[10:46:36] <dminuoso> Im looking for fresh ideas to debug my "increasingly slow scrolling problem in terminal mode" I talked about in the past few days. For the uninvolved: Im using haskell-mode which does some font locking - as a result, editing text causes scrolling to become increasingly slow

[10:47:25] <dminuoso> This is only noticable in terminal mode, in gui mode everything is fine. This is on emacs 27.1
[10:47:39] <cjb> set the gc threshold to extra low?
[10:47:40] <dminuoso> (or to be fair, I dont know whether its actually fine in gui mode, at least I dont notice it)
[10:47:49] <cjb> like 100 or something
[10:47:53] <dminuoso> cjb: that'd be a workaround at best, and I need the high gc value for lsp to not be painful
[10:48:12] <dminuoso> It seems completely unreasonable that a delayed garbage collection would make scrolling slower, wouldnt you agree?
[10:49:30] <jensecj> It sounds odd that collecting garbage would speed up the buffer again, for sure
[10:50:20] <hexeme> anyway to make circe open things in the same window?
[10:50:21] <dminuoso> Im not familiar with the execution/memory model of elisp, my current theory revolves around strings accumuluating extreme amounts of indirection, which get cleaned up by GC. But this is only founded by trying to explain the GC>

[16:34:30] <labrax> Hello! I'm having some trouble with Magit
[16:35:05] <labrax> the output from 'top' shows:  25.0   2.7   1:06.17 emacs  - I'd say that over a minute of CPU time doesn't seem right
[16:35:26] <dpk> depends what you're doing
[16:35:28] <labrax> Is there a signal I can send to Emacs to stop the process?
[16:35:31] <dpk> oh, that's the emacs side. hmm
[16:35:46] <labrax> It's only a single commit running :/
[16:36:00] <dpk> well, that's measuring your total CPU time across your whole Emacs session …
[16:36:09] *** Joins: rememberYou (~someone@12.151-66-87.adsl-dyn.isp.belgacom.be)
[16:36:09] <labrax> it's only been open for a few minutes ):
[16:36:13] <jensecj> you can send SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2 to enter debug iirc
[16:36:23] <dpk> if you run git log in the terminal, does it show that the commit is there?
[16:36:56] <labrax> dpk, nope, because it's loading the page to type the commit message 
[16:37:04] <dpk> hmm
[16:37:07] <labrax> It is very slowly drawing the page, but it usually takes a few seconds
[16:37:20] <labrax> jensecj, thanks I'll try that
[16:37:26] <dpk> … that's very weird and could be a problem in Emacs itself, not Magit specifically?

This slows down my emacs. And from time to time the doc of the current selected method (e.g. pandas.read_csv) appears in a mini-buffer. I do not need it.

[21:58:24] <wasamasa> there's later some code to react to window size changes

[21:59:46] <wasamasa> this suggests that it should launch inside the same window
