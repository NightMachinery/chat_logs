[16:58:00] <bandali> hey dragestil, you around?
[16:58:41] <dragestil> bandali: yeah
[16:59:04] <dragestil> how's it going
[16:59:18] <bandali> dragestil, hey, going quite okay, thanks :) yourself?
[16:59:47] <dragestil> good too, thanks
[16:59:55] <bandali> glad to hear :)
[16:59:57] <bandali> so, i was looking at your librejs-compliance patch on the list
[17:00:09] <bandali> you mentioned you pushed something to the emacsconf wiki, but i couldn't find it :/
[17:00:18] <bandali> do you have a link and/or commit hash?
[17:00:20] <dragestil> no i didn't push anything
[17:00:47] <dragestil> ok i see what you mean
[17:01:01] <bandali> oh... i must've misinterpreted "I have placed the weblabel table in the emacsconf wiki" then
[17:01:29] <dragestil> what i was saying was that part of the patch was on the emacswiki repo
[17:01:56] <dragestil> was meant to be on the emacswiki repo
[17:02:09] <bandali> ahh, riight...
[17:02:40] <dragestil> naturally I would first consider placing such patches on the server hosting chat.emacsconf.org

[17:03:00] *** Quits: lounge-963 (lounge963@front0.emacsconf.org) (Client Quit)
[17:03:26] <dragestil> but as I have no visibility to the server, i decided to "simulate the patch" against the emacswiki 
[17:03:34] <bandali> right right. yeah i think it might be more straightforward to serve the jslicenses.html page/file statically from somewhere under chat.emacsconf.org itself
[17:03:53] <bandali> but i'd imagine putting it on the wiki could work too
[17:04:16] <dragestil> yeah, i'm ok with either
[17:05:47] <dragestil> sorry, s/emacswiki/emacsconf wiki/g 
[17:06:17] <bandali> cool cool :)
[17:06:42] <bandali> thanks for the patch :) i'll try to apply it in a bit
[17:07:21] <dragestil> no problem
[17:08:57] <dragestil> let me know if there are any problems. i had no clue how to generate a patch outside of a git repo, so i just diff'd two files at two locations and edited the result manually (referring to the index.html.tpl)
[17:12:39] <bandali> sure will do, thanks :) and yeah i'd make a ".original" copy of a file X before changing it, then after making the changes, do "diff -Naur X.original X > my.patch" or something like that
[17:12:59] <dragestil> sounds good
[17:14:37] <bandali> :) oh, i usually do "orig" instead of "original"; sorry i haven't fully woken up yet lol
[17:16:17] <dragestil> yeah orig sounds more familiar. no worries, i have the opposite problem of trying not to fall asleep
[17:16:58] <bandali> oh haha. that's not great :/
[17:32:09] <dragestil> i'm reading analysis of gplv2 to stay awake
[17:34:39] <bandali> nice :D
