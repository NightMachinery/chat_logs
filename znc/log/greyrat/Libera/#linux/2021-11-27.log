[06:40:48] <Sauvin> The machinations proposed for going about it, though, well... it hurt my head.

[06:48:47] <Blondie101010> it is not made to do that
[06:48:59] <Blondie101010> but yest testdisk often helps
[06:49:15] <xx> it kinda does, because it converts an analog thing (amplitude) into a digital thing
[06:49:31] <Blondie101010> the likelyhood of success depends on what part of the drive the directory was in, and where your new files went

[09:25:44] <kj7rrv> So I can run a full distro inside docker?
[09:26:22] <cluelessperson> kj7rrv, docker allows you to build/pull premade "images",   run them as "containers", that store changes.   Data that you expect to be persistent should typically be kept in "volumes" though that are attached, so you can upgrade the images easily.
[09:26:52] <cluelessperson> kj7rrv, well, less "full distro",  docker is made to run just the application/environment that you need, using the same kernel of the host machine.

[11:35:44] <sazawal> Sauvin, No, I'd keep it fixed. Would be better if the capture works even when it is in the background or minimized. ImageMagick guys can do all that, I just provide the window title and no coordinates and it captures, but its terribly slow.
[11:36:33] <sazawal> pywin32 capture works the same way, except for minimized windows, though I didn't check that yet.

[11:51:43] <sazawal> Also, the 0.3 seconds could be a wrong requirement. I specified 0.3 seconds with ImageMagick and in the benchmarking page it shows that the capturing takes about 2.4 seconds, so my 0.3 seconds is not changing anythin in my program. Maybe 1 capture every second would work for me.

[18:53:20] <phogg`> Soni: I don't want to import random things into my copy of a repo, because that would be chaos (and build failures). I want contributions created by people I trust and, preferably, reviewed by me. It therefore shouldn't just magically cause patches to appear, even if it could.

[20:59:27] <tbs-> i m currently learning php as first language to start programing. i found about vim and now using tmux+neovim. im thinking about using php to earn money, teacher also shows things about http, css, javascript little bit so we can build a good shopping website alone. i also want to build android apps. im thinking about learning kotlin language to
[20:59:27] <tbs-> build android apps.  i learned that i can use kotlin/js for web pages instead of javascript.
[20:59:28] <tbs-> i wonder if im at good road about kotlin and kotlin/js or should i learn javascript first and kotlin and kotlin/js later or shouldnt learn kotlin/js and just learn javascript. i searched a lot of hours at web but couldnt satisfy my mind.
[20:59:28] <tbs-> so i would like to read your opinions ^^

[21:14:16] <tbs-> thanks guys,  with your opinions now im thinking about not replacing js with kotlin/js and i may use js for building android apps like web apps with js. now i wonder if there s more badsides of web app other than accessing local files.
[21:14:20] <rascul> xx that's all i know, i don't use xfce or suspend and just did some searching around
[21:14:27] <xx> I think I'll just have to suspend from terminal instead, running something like `xscreensaver-command --lock && systemctl suspend`
