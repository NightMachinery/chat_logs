[04:50:08] <Panther> imho, the finer points of opping are, as far as 99% of what goes on, ops are equal to every other person in the channel. Once in a great while, you might have to deal with network policy violations so the channel doesn't get shut down, or flooders, spammers, etc... but other than that, if you think that by being an op, you 'outrank' everyone else, you are wrong.

[11:12:55] <R2robot> If I don't scrobble to last.fm, did I really listen to it?
[11:13:05] <labrador> piercedwater-, cuz I'm also a free software guy
[11:13:23] <labrador> Libre.fm is ok tho...not that i use it. I just "scrobble" to mpd
[11:13:24] <labrador> lol
[11:13:25] <piercedwater-> hmm
[11:13:26] <R2robot> i think most of us on this irc network are as well :D
[11:13:49] <R2robot> mpd can scrobble to last and libre fm
[11:13:54] <piercedwater-> cool

[11:17:42] <sublim20> well i mean, what civilizations are still referenced today
[11:17:47] <labrador> Or the harappans
[11:18:13] <sublim20> seems like the greeks are the oldest ones whose terms / ideas / gods etc, are still referenced
[11:18:29] <piercedwater-> volume @ 100% wooo
[11:18:34] <piercedwater-> re: robot pic
[11:18:44] <R2robot> haha
[11:18:50] <labrador> sublim20, the harappans and the mesopotamians ideas aren't lost. They were picked up by later civilizations
[11:19:06] <R2robot> piercedwater-: for some reason it doesn't adjust the volume any more. 
[11:19:11] <piercedwater-> oh hmm
[11:19:18] <R2robot> I haven't looked into it..
[11:19:29] <labrador> R2robot, atleast now you have bit perfect playback!
[11:19:32] <piercedwater-> i use the knob on my hw device
[11:19:53] <labrador> piercedwater-, ye better choice
[11:20:01] <labrador> Most devices don't have a hardware knob tho
[11:21:00] <piercedwater-> i just pick a volume level and leave it for the most part
[11:21:19] <labrador> piercedwater-, do you use replaygain?
[11:21:20] <R2robot> labrador: I do?
[11:21:26] <piercedwater-> i do not
[11:21:38] <labrador> R2robot, probably not considering its a mac and isn't using alsa or something
[11:21:41] <piercedwater-> should i? is it worth looking in to?
[11:21:44] <labrador> Can you hear say a notif bell?
[11:21:48] <labrador> while listening to music?
[11:22:06] <R2robot> labrador: oh.. thank goodness for that.  I don't miss sound sub systems on linux at all
[11:22:14] <labrador> R2robot, why? Its quite easy
[11:22:22] <piercedwater-> hmm not sure. i hear lots of details but not sure if i have heard the particular instrument
[11:22:30] <R2robot> labrador: maybe no.. back in the day it SUCKED
[11:22:40] <labrador> oh so oss days?
[11:22:44] <labrador> Probably did tbh
[11:22:46] <R2robot> s/no/now
[11:23:06] <R2robot> I used linux from like 1994 to 2007/8
[11:23:40] <R2robot> I hated when the DE's started taking over.  I prefered to just have my windowmanager running on X
[11:23:41] <labrador> R2robot, you could try doing bit perfect playback on a mac too
[11:23:46] <labrador> Surely it isn't impossible
[11:24:53] <R2robot> running a WM on X, and then trying to load alsa or gnome or KDE's sound system and it would load all kinds of libraries.  it was a mess.
[11:25:36] <labrador> R2robot, I don't really know a lot about kde's "sound system"...I think it just uses pulse?
[11:25:39] <labrador> Or pipewire
[11:25:49] <R2robot> pulse sounds familiar
[11:26:19] <labrador> yeah there's no soundsystem for kde specifically...tho there might be a lib kde uses for its apps
[11:26:23] <R2robot> but I didn't want any kde stuff.. but maybe just one kde app and it would then load all the KDE sub systems creating sound conflicts etc.
[11:26:54] <R2robot> it just got to be too much of a pain
[11:27:07] <labrador> R2robot, could do. I wasn't using linux a decade ago. Probably a little unpolished
[11:27:36] <R2robot> I bought a mac mini in 2k5 and used to remote into it from my linux box.. by 2007/8 I spent more time VNC'd to the mac, so i just made it my permanent desktop :D
[11:28:15] <piercedwater-> macs are sooo slick
[11:28:16] <R2robot> labrador: which distro are you using?
[11:28:33] <R2robot> piercedwater-: yes :D
[11:28:38] <labrador> R2robot, debian. It preconfigures so much I'd never know what was running on it though
[11:29:05] <R2robot> I mean, I still spend 90% of my time in the terminal on my mac. heh.  Still use Mutt for email, vim, tmux, etc.
[11:29:16] <R2robot> labrador: ahh
[11:29:24] <piercedwater-> do you use a package manager on your mac, R2robot?
