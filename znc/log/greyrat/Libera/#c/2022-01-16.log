[11:15:39] <jaggz> since strlen() is possibly runtime, it gets upset about the variable-size.
[11:15:51] <jaggz> in general, consider strlen() runtime, although optimization can detect and remove that stuff

[11:23:18] <nitrix> The reason why `char str[] = "hi";` succeeds and `char str[3]; str = "hi";` doesn't is because they have different semantics.
[11:24:15] <nitrix> The former is an initialization, while the latter is an assignment. You cannot assign to an array, it's not an lvalue. The elements are.
[11:25:34] <nitrix> As for why you're allowed to initialize arrays with string literals, it's a special case for convenience.
[11:25:36] <nitrix> ,c11 6.7.9p14
[11:25:37] <candide> http://www.iso-9899.info/n1570.html#6.7.9p14 [Initialization] An array of character type may be initialized by a character string literal or UTF-8 string literal, optionally enclosed in braces. Successive bytes of the string literal (including the terminating null character if there is room or if the array is of unknown size) initialize the elements of the array.

[12:06:28] <nitrix> The more general warning that not every compiler supports the feature seems a lot more useful than pointing out that one older standard required compilers to support it.

[15:05:50] <sham1> Depends on what you want to do with `x` and what is clearer in the specific situation

[15:21:20] <dan_pena> int **array_ptr is valid no? if it was int**array_ptr_ptr it was hungarian notation right?
[15:21:53] <sham1> That's not a descriptive name at all
[15:22:33] <dan_pena> sham1: what do you mean?
[15:22:55] <dan_pena> I mean it's a pointer to an array of ptr
[15:23:13] *** Joins: magla (~gelignite@55d4ed71.access.ecotel.net)
[15:23:21] <sham1> Sure, but why
[15:23:23] <dave0> naming things is hard
[15:23:32] <sham1> What purpose does this pointer to an array have
[15:24:24] <dave0> dan_pena: try to name it after what's in it, not what type it is
[15:24:41] <NRK[m]> ^
[15:25:01] <dan_pena> for example in my array is an array of pointer to leaves. I will call it struct leaf **leaves_ptr;
[15:25:09] <dan_pena> s/in/if/
[15:25:10] <NRK[m]> so something like `int *four_bytes` would be better
[15:25:16] <NRK[m]> :)
[15:25:17] <sham1> I'd name that `struct leaf **leaves`
[15:25:23] <dan_pena> okey
[15:25:45] <sham1> The plural implies an array-like structure.
[15:25:55] <dan_pena> the dev is supposed to understand by reading the type and not the name of the var
[15:26:11] <dan_pena> i see
[15:26:19] <sham1> struct leaf *leaves[];
[15:26:23] <NRK[m]> you can just go to the decel to see the type
[15:26:28] <dave0> you can infer the type by how you use it...   leaves[x][y]   is a strong hint that it's a 2d array
[15:26:46] <NRK[m]> and the compiler will warn you if you do something weird anyways
[15:26:54] <sham1> Or if you want to be really fancy, `struct leaf *(*leaves)[]`;

[16:52:57] <Kerr> That is, get two statements out of an if without using {}
[16:53:53] <Kerr> The main motivation being able to do the dozen or so of these on a single line each, instead of 5 lines each to otherwise match the typical style.
[16:58:35] *** Quits: APic (apic@apic.name) (Quit: [TLS] Client upgrade)
[16:58:44] <sham1> I'd do `if (strcmp(args[i], "-no_config") == 0) { config->no_config = true; continue; }` for clarity. That is, have the braces on the same line as the condition

[16:59:09] <sham1> Also a bike shedding thing, but I'd name the option "-no-config"
[16:59:56] <sham1> And maybe use -- unless long options already use - in the application for some convention reason
[17:02:33] <dave0> how many years is there unix and the syntax of command line arguments is not standard?
[17:03:42] <sham1> We have a standard way of doing arguments, POSIX, it's just that there's no standard for long options

[21:35:59] <cousteau> I'm also wondering about the explicit use of `extern` with function declarations.  To this date, I'm still not 100% sure it has any meaning (beyond explicitly reminding the programmer that function declarations are extern by default)
[21:37:40] <nomagno> cousteau: File-system wise. Hm, well I guess it is an issue, yes. The way I use it right now is symlinking the include folder to a path with halfworld in it
[21:38:00] <cousteau> ah, well no wonder you weren't getting any errors :)
[21:38:08] <nomagno> I think if I want it to keep the verbosity in including I could just make a subfolder?
[21:38:20] *** Quits: jmiehe (~Thunderbi@user/jmiehe) (Quit: jmiehe)
[21:38:57] <nomagno> cousteau: I know this won't work out of the box, I was just wondering in general, as in, how to split files and if there are any obvious issues with my organizational scheme.
[21:39:05] <cousteau> file system wise I doubt I'll be of much help because my usual way to go is just to put all .c and .h files together in the same directory (and if that seems untidy for you, you should see what my desk looks like...)
[21:39:15] <nomagno> I will make a subfolder
[21:39:36] <APic> Is this not rather something for ##workingset?
[21:39:42] <nomagno> cousteau: Well yeah, I was doing that but I found it too messy from the third-party interface implementor point of view...
[21:40:00] <nomagno> ... Are third-party interface implementors a common thing?
[21:40:20] <nomagno> APic: Well I guess it's not related to the C language, but it also doesn't have much to do with anything in workingset
[21:40:29] <nomagno> it's a meta C question
[21:40:30] <APic> Good.
[21:40:40] *** Quits: kexec (~kexec@user/kexec) (Quit: Client closed)
[21:40:48] <cousteau> nomagno: is this some sort of API?  Because if not it doesn't make much sense to put everything inside its own include subdirectory
[21:42:07] <cousteau> in fact, I would imagine that the way to go is to have an include/ directory, put your main header files there, along with the ones you'll only be using internally, and when installing the project you'll be copying those headers from <project>/include/ to <prefix>/include/
[21:42:29] *** Quits: zmt00 (~zmt00@user/zmt00) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[21:42:50] <cousteau> or rather, from <project>/include/ to <prefix>/include/projectname/
[21:42:50] <nomagno> cousteau: The whole point of the project is to provide specifications, interfaces, and implementations for those interfaces, in a lightweight and portable way. But I guess I do mean to have each of the headers be its own API, and have a single reference implementation of an engine to combine it all
[21:43:37] <cousteau> and your .c files inside <project>/src/ would refer to those include files simply as #include "some_header.h", rather than #include <project_name/some_header.h>
[21:44:42] <cousteau> I think you'll probably want to separate the headers your project needs in order to compile the library from the headers the end user will need in order to write code targeting the library, unless the two are pretty much the same
[21:44:52] *** Joins: ka80 (~ka80@111.60.138.34.bc.googleusercontent.com)
[21:45:35] <nomagno> I mean, they're the same. It's explicitly written to be a modular implementation of a series of specifications
[21:45:44] *** Joins: Betal (~Betal@user/betal)
[21:46:02] <nomagno> The top-level interface will be that of the actual game engine, which will still not really be frontend in the traditional sense
[21:46:10] <nomagno> And each of the parts will definitely work in isolation
[21:46:48] <cousteau> so the goal is not to write a library, but a bunch of copyable files that other users will merge into their C project?
[21:47:38] <nomagno> Uh... No, it's a buncha libraries that combine together to make a game engine, and the game engine is also a library, then possibly you can make a wrapper for the game engine
[21:47:43] <cousteau> typically what I see for most projects is a library (.so or .a or both) which is compiled from the C sources, plus a collection of header files
[21:48:34] <nomagno> The top-level engine library itself will definitely allow easy access to all interfaces the engine uses both internally and externally. Mainly because they're ALL designed to be useful
[21:48:54] <nomagno> So the .a/.so bundle approach sounds appropiate
[21:49:06] <cousteau> so if someone wants to use that library in their program, they need to have the .a/.so plus all the .h files in order to compile the program
[21:49:08] *** Joins: smoke (~smoke@user/smoke)
[21:49:36] <nomagno> Well yeah, ideally I'd provide a makefile at sound point
[21:50:15] <nomagno> But that's when I actually get to implementing all of the halfive.h interfaces, which is the physics engine and basic backend functionality part
[21:50:29] <cousteau> you'll typically provide a makefile that runs `gcc -c` and `ar` to create the .a, and that may also have a `make install` option that copies those (plus the headers) to the specified location under /usr or whatever

[21:51:46] <sham1> ${DESTDIR}${PREFIX} specifically, with $DESTDIR being by default empty, since that's used by package management stuff for building the packages for a "fake root" of sorts
[21:51:47] <cousteau> yeah... whatever it's called; probably the guys at #workingset know it better than me
[21:52:38] <cousteau> but my point is, the end user of the library won't see your .c files (except when compiling the library itself), only the resulting library and necessary headers
[21:52:44] <nomagno> Yeah that's a bit out of the scope of my consult
[21:52:47] <nomagno> Thanks though!
[21:53:48] <nomagno> The most time-consuming part of the project remains to choose clean data structures and interfaces...

[21:55:07] <cousteau> although I guess that if you're gonna use the same .h files for compiling the library and for using it later, they need to include other headers as `#include <halfworld/blah.h>` rather than `#include "blah.h"` anyway
[21:55:22] *** Joins: bkhl (~bkhl@user/bkhl)
[21:55:45] <nomagno> Well yes, I had that in mind
[21:55:46] <cousteau> in that case, it seems convenient to put all headers in [project]/include/halfworld/
[21:56:03] <cousteau> so you don't have to do nasty symlink stuff to workaround that
[21:56:03] <nomagno> Already pushed that change, yeah
[21:56:28] <omegatron> and any private header in [project]/include/halfworld-private  for example
[21:56:51] <cousteau> well, if there are going to be any private headers
[21:57:05] <cousteau> (they could even be in [project]/src/ directly)
[21:57:16] <nomagno> Hm, would y'all say the project is creeping out of the 'toy' class? Long way to be useful, but
[21:57:17] <omegatron> yeah - it's a matter of taste
[21:57:28] <nomagno> There are not any private headers, no

[21:59:58] *** Joins: stonkey (~stonkey@user/stonkey)
[22:00:01] <cousteau> another thing to consider: there's nothing wrong in having headers refer to each other relatively, e.g. include/halfworld/header1.h may contain `#include "header2.h"` rather than `#include <halfworld/header2.h>`
[22:00:16] <cousteau> I think that's how it works in most cases.  Let me have a look at SDL
[22:00:54] <cousteau> where's my SDL stuff??
[22:02:16] <nomagno> I should probably add a note that if there are ANY assumptions made about the target not marked out in hwreq.h, it will be immediately fixed on notice
[22:02:35] <cousteau> ok... so /usr/include/GL/ seems to use absolute paths, but I could swear that SDL headers (which I thought I had installed) use relative includes
[22:05:37] *** Joins: evocatus (~evocatus@62.182.77.224)

[22:06:24] <cousteau> ok yes.  So SDL includes ALL indirectly-included files as `#include "SDL_something.h"` rather than `#include <SDL2/SDL_something.h>`, which kinda makes sense because that way it doesn't matter how the dir with all the SDL headers is called; you just take care to include the "master" SDL.h header in your program and it'll include all the other ones by relative reference
[22:07:18] <cousteau> so, the only place where it makes sense to use `#include <halfworld/...>` instead of `#include "..."` is in the documentation :)
[22:07:48] <nomagno> cousteau: Hm, now that you have SDL installed, you mind uncommenting the main function in hwvi.c, running the thingy, and checking if you get a sound playing and a nice striped pattern on a window?
[22:08:13] <nomagno> I'm really paranoid since I don't have many systems to test that part out on comfortably
[22:08:13] <cousteau> argh, I fell on a trap :)
[22:08:41] <nomagno> Yeah you have to run 70 tests before I let you pass to the next room, sorry

[22:21:38] <cousteau> gotta go now.  Hope that executable didn't install a virus or something because I didn't check anything... :P
[22:21:50] <cousteau> well I'll wait for that screenshot

[22:22:24] <cousteau> ok yes that's what I saw.  Couldn't tell if it was working or if the screen was doing something weird
[22:22:49] <cousteau> Bye!  Good luck with the project :)
[22:23:08] <nomagno> It took me a while to find a visually distinct pattern that wasn't probable cause for convulsions on a fraction of the population... a long while
[22:23:09] <nomagno> Bye! Thanks
[22:24:21] <cousteau> maybe a checkerboard pattern would've been more obvious.  For me, 45° diagonals are synonym for "the pixel array is 1px too narrow and these were supposed to be vertical" :P
