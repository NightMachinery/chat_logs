[01:05:03] <mongole> hi. how can I get rid of the "Closing link [Please try again later - reconnecting too fast]" error?
[01:05:47] <MetaNova> mongole: /msg *status disconnect
[01:05:53] <MetaNova> wait several minutes
[01:06:04] <MetaNova> I suggest at least 5.
[01:06:05] <MetaNova> then /msg *status connect
[01:06:35] <mongole> gives me "Not connected. Try /server <host> [<port>]"
[01:06:59] <MetaNova> um
[01:07:16] <mongole> how can I message *status when znc refuses my connnection?
[01:07:21] <MetaNova> so, it seems like ZNC is rejecting your client connection for reconnecting too fast?
[01:07:26] <mongole> yes
[01:07:29] <MetaNova> then, tell your client to stop connecting
[01:07:37] <MetaNova> then wait
[01:07:41] <MetaNova> then connect again
[01:07:43] <mongole> is there a way to disable that?
[01:08:30] <mongole> I don't want znc to refuse connections
[01:08:47] <MetaNova> I'm not sure, I've never had to solve that problem before
[01:09:03] <MetaNova> if it's a product of fail2ban, then unload that module
[01:09:29] <MetaNova> if, after doing so, you still get the message, then I don't know
[01:09:50] <MetaNova> looking at the delay/throttle settings, I don't see one regarding client connections
[01:14:22] <mongole> good hint, might be fail2ban! how do I unload a module when not connected? :) 
[01:15:27] <MetaNova> either wait until you are, or try webadmin
[01:15:41] <MetaNova> or kill ZNC and restart it (any timers should get reset), then unload it then
[01:16:12] <mongole> surprise, webadmin says "ERROR :Closing link [Please try again later - reconnecting too fast]" :D
[01:16:42] <mongole> any way to unload the module from the linux shell?
[01:16:51] <mongole> without restarting znc?
[01:16:54] <MetaNova> no.
[01:17:00] <mongole> great

[02:27:13] <MrGlass> Hi I have a weird issue. I can connect to ZNC just fine from my client (hexchat) but when I try to connect using the python IRC library it can't establish a connection. The library works when i connect to libera directly.

[15:10:28] <DarthGandalf> that's why you can't connect
[15:10:29] <MetaNova> lol
[15:10:35] <DarthGandalf> why did you choose localhost?
[15:10:52] <DarthGandalf> to fix this: /msg *status clearbindhost
[15:10:54] <MetaNova> jtgd: that means "make outbound connections only through localhost"
[15:10:55] <MetaNova> jtgd: do: '/msg *status clearbindhost' and '/msg *status clearuserbindhost'
[15:10:58] <jtgd> I am trying to connect from the same computer znc is on
[15:11:04] <DarthGandalf> that doesn't matter
[15:11:16] <jtgd> what should it be?
[15:11:23] <DarthGandalf> it shouldn't be set
[15:11:24] <MetaNova> blank
[15:11:48] <jtgd> oh, it didn't say that during the configuration
[15:11:55] <jtgd> will retry...
[15:12:04] <DarthGandalf> it did...
[15:12:18] <DarthGandalf> wait, which version are you using?
[15:13:30] <jtgd> ZNC 1.8.2 according to web interface
[15:13:41] <jtgd> I just installed it from Arch
[15:14:06] <DarthGandalf> ah, I didn't remove the bind host question from that wizard, yeah
[15:15:13] <jtgd> it seems to have connected, though it got my nick wrong
[15:15:52] <DarthGandalf> let me guess, it chose jtgd_ ?
[15:16:08] <jtgd> is this SASL module installed or do I have to do something?
[15:16:20] <jtgd> no jay_
[15:16:33] <MetaNova> the sasl module is installed
[15:16:41] <MetaNova> load it with /msg *status loadmod sasl
[15:16:41] <DarthGandalf> then you configured jay_ in the nick
[15:17:00] <MetaNova> more likely jay
[15:17:03] <MetaNova> since jay is in use
[15:17:10] <Jay2k1> i am? oh
[15:17:22] <MetaNova> not you
[15:17:22] <DarthGandalf> Jay2k1: yes, you're in use :P
[15:17:36] <jtgd> will that module stay loaded after restart?
[15:17:42] <MetaNova> yes
[15:17:54] <MetaNova> jtgd: after loading sasl, configure it with /msg *sasl set jtgd YourNickservPassword
[15:18:15] <DarthGandalf> it also provides a page in web interface
[15:18:42] <jtgd> oh ok
[15:19:08] <jtgd> so when I do things like /join, do I do that in the *status channel?
[15:19:26] <DarthGandalf> it should work anywhere
[15:20:49] <jtgd> how does my IRC client know? is it ok to be connected to znc and also other servers from my client?
[15:21:23] <DarthGandalf> that depends on your client, but most likely yes
[15:21:52] <DarthGandalf> but why would you also connect directly if you use znc?
[15:22:31] <MetaNova> I think that was more a general question rather than, "I expect problems"
[15:23:05] <jtgd> I also connect to bitlbee, which is local
[15:23:14] <MetaNova> you can mix and match ZNC and non-ZNC connections in any client
[15:23:21] <jtgd> should I do that through znc too?
[15:23:23] <DarthGandalf> MetaNova: not any
[15:23:23] <MetaNova> clients don't care (ZNC is just another IRC server to them)
[15:23:34] <MetaNova> DarthGandalf: what do you mean?
[15:23:35] <jtgd> ok
[15:23:43] <DarthGandalf> Some clients support a single connection
[15:23:48] <MetaNova> oh
[15:23:49] <MetaNova> well
[15:23:58] <MetaNova> technically true
[15:24:09] <DarthGandalf> jtgd: you can do either way
[15:24:16] <jtgd> I disconnected the channel I was testing with (#emacs on libera) and reconnected but it still says I am jay_
[15:24:32] <MetaNova> the nick 'jay' is already in use by someone
[15:24:33] <DarthGandalf> if you feel connecting znc to bitlbee will help you in any way, sure
[15:24:57] <jtgd> but I changed it to jtgd, both in general settings and SASL settings
[15:25:09] <MetaNova> the nick 'jtgd' is also in use
[15:25:10] <MetaNova> by you
[15:25:32] <jtgd> so I need to disconnect from znc and then come back in?
[15:25:38] <MetaNova> a nick can only be used by a single connection, and right now, your connection is using it
[15:25:46] <jtgd> how do I tell znc to drop the connection to libera?
[15:25:49] <MetaNova> jtgd: no, change your current nick if you want ZNC to use jtgd
[15:26:00] <DarthGandalf> /znc disconnect
[15:26:26] <DarthGandalf> but you know, there's also a command /nick
[15:26:32] <DarthGandalf> to let you change the nick after connectino
[15:27:04] <jtgd> my client does not know the command /znc
[15:27:24] <jtgd> right, but I'd like to see this works from the start, with sasl
[15:27:26] <DarthGandalf> too bad, usually clients send unknown commands to server
[15:27:42] <jtgd> how would it know which server? 
[15:27:51] <jtgd> I typed it in *status
[15:27:59] <jtgd> I am using circe in emacs
[15:28:01] <DarthGandalf> probably to the server of that window
[15:28:22] <DarthGandalf> never used circe
[15:28:23] <DarthGandalf> but
[15:28:31] <DarthGandalf> <DarthGandalf> /znc is an alias
[15:28:53] <DarthGandalf> if you don't want to configure your client to send unknown commands as is, you can always use /msg *status manually instead
[15:28:59] <jtgd> well it's not an alias in circe
[15:29:08] <MetaNova> server-side alias, he means
[15:29:12] <DarthGandalf> it doesn't need to be alias in circe
[15:29:22] <DarthGandalf> again, usually clients send unknown commands to server
[15:29:24] <MetaNova> just like 'cs' is a server-side alias to /msg chanserv (as in, /quote cs)
[15:29:34] <jtgd> so how do I disconnect?
[15:29:40] <DarthGandalf> <DarthGandalf> /znc disconnect
[15:29:57] <jtgd> how do I di it without the /znc, since that doesn't work
[15:29:59] <MetaNova> which is the same as /msg *status disconnect
[15:30:22] <jtgd> that worked

[15:36:39] <DarthGandalf> <jtgd> why is it still saying jay_ at all?

[15:37:06] <jtgd> cool. this is what I've wanted since I moved from weechat to circe. I lose stuff when I exit emacs, but I like circe better than weechat (in some ways)
[15:37:25] <MetaNova> I can honestly say I've never heard someone say that before
[15:37:28] <jtgd> I had jay_ as alternate nick, but jtgd as nick
[15:37:42] <DarthGandalf> inability to send unknown commands to server is not a plus of circe

[17:54:17] <IceMichael> hi guys
[17:54:26] <IceMichael> question, is there any smart way to have playback only once per device?
[17:54:53] <IceMichael> at the moment, I configured to not remove playbacks because I use two devices with my ZNC. And I want the whole chat history on both completely, locally
[17:55:07] <IceMichael> but each time I start my client on either system, it will do the playback again and again
[17:55:21] <IceMichael> is there something like "do each playback only once - PER DEVICE"?

[23:21:12] <tinyweasel> hello, I'm trying to do tor via ZNC, with cert auth, but I'm still getting the notice that " Public-key (NOT password) SASL authentication is required to connect to the Tor onion service"
[23:21:18] <tinyweasel> cert, etc., module is all loaded

[23:51:00] <Lartza> :(
[23:51:01] <MetaNova> Lartza: where's ZNC 1.9.x-git development/master branch install?
[23:51:14] <MetaNova> +version
[23:51:44] <Lartza> I mean that wouldn't be hard to build :P Should probably migrate away from Q module first
[23:54:42] <Lartza> I don't really know why but I still built ZNC from source even though 11 has 1.8.2 in repos
