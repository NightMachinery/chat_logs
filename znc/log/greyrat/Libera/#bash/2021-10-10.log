[00:50:20] <jetchisel> !\0
[00:50:20] <greybot> ASCII zero, the null byte, aka 'NUL' is the best delimiter for lists of strings (eg. file names). However, there isn't much you can do with it in portable scripts. Bash can read null-byte delimited input with "while IFS= read -d ''; do ... ". Bash cannot store or pass a null byte as parameter. *Unportable* versions of the following utilities can work with NULs: find, sort, xargs, and sed.

[01:08:29] <earnestly> It also sounds like the job for a supervisor
[01:08:48] <jensen> I'm considering using a naming scheme for functions, curious if anyone have any suggestions to improve or advice in general: prefix function name with an _ if it's a helper function (i.e. function used in other functions and not intended to be used on its own) and capitalize all function names in a utility script to be sourced and used by other scripts. Are these conventions applicable in other
[01:08:50] <jensen> programming languages? I don't want to develop bad habits with naming schemes that might not make sense when my bash improves

[01:46:11] <earnestly> jensen: The performance of the shell is expressed through the commands you run.  Such as sort, typically written in C, quite fast.  Don't make the shell do what sort(1) does, it will be extremely slow

[05:06:59] <jensen> How do you decide whether to use process substitution or piping? Which is generally preferred? Piping seems more common but doesn't it involve an extra fork, resulting in relatively lower performance?

[05:28:54] <jensen> Btw, on Arch Linux, sh is a symlink to bash. I use the shebang `#!/usr/bin/env sh` for all scripts that shellcheck doesn't complain about non-POSIX stuff. Is there any reason not to install dash for sh to point to? All the `sh` shebang scripts where shellcheck didn't complain are still 100% POSIX-compliant so dash should be plug and play in this regard?

[05:32:43] <tirnanog> i.e. why bother installing two shells when we can have one? that it might not be a bad thing for users writing sh scripts isn't going to be the first consideration.

[05:36:47] <tirnanog> also, the authors of bash chose to implement new features, above and beyond merely implementing it as a clone of the bourne shell. it is "bourne again", after all.
[05:36:55] <neshpion> generally scripts with /bin/sh in the shebang line should be written with POSIX compliance, and if you use bashisms, you should put #!/bin/bash in the shebang
[05:37:10] <hyrcanus> did the added features break old bourne shell scripts?
[05:37:23] <tirnanog> no. that's why arch can get away with it.
[05:37:40] <tirnanog> but it's a nuisance if you're targetting sh, because it's all to easy to introduce bashisms unwittingly.
[05:37:44] <neshpion> the added features are not intelligible to POSIX shell, but it is a superset of POSIX so any valid POSIX script will run in bash

[08:40:50] <Hazoune> [ "$(tty)" = /dev/tty1 ] && exec sx
[08:40:54] <Hazoune> should I use single/double quotes in /dev/tty1? shellcheck doesn't check anything wrong, is it enough without single/double quotes?
[08:41:42] <phogg> Hazoune: it doesn't make any difference
[08:42:02] <phogg> since nothing is expanded and the string is fixed you can know for sure the amount of escaping you need for safety (which is none)
[08:42:21] <Hazoune> phogg, thank you!
[08:46:27] <Hazoune> last question, it should be double brackets or no? like this [[ "$(tty)" = /dev/tty1 ]] && exec sx
[08:47:26] <phogg> Hazoune: if your bang line describes a shell that supports [[ then you should use it

[08:49:02] <Hazoune> I see. In posix sh with double brackets, it is undefined.
[08:49:17] <phogg> Hazoune: correct, it is not standard

[17:06:06] <theBox> Hi. I have a problem with bash. I want to split up a large .wav file into smaller sections. The data for these sections is contained in something like a cue file, but much simpler: first field is the starting point, second field is the end point and the third field up to the end is the title of the section file. I have written a script that reads
[17:06:06] <theBox> this cue-like file and sets off ffmpeg commands; the script can be found at termbin.com/qwel
[17:06:39] <theBox> The cue-like file can be found at termbin.com/nu7sp
[17:09:27] *** Quits: node1 (~node1@user/node1) (Quit: Leaving)
[17:09:39] <theBox> Reading the file line by line into three variables works fine. However, when I set off the ffmpeg commands the read command gets confused and doesn't read in the lines properly anymore. The result is, that the second ffmpeg command is set off as ffmpeg -i Cassette Side A.wav -ss 1650 -to 96.689924 B.flac for example, even though the correct
[17:09:39] <theBox> starting point is 77.711650. The first five characters of the line seem to be ignored. How can I fix this?
[17:10:00] <theBox> Err of the starting field seem to be ignored
[17:10:07] <theBox> Well, same difference.
[17:14:48] <twkm> probably failure to quote the expansions.

[22:16:17] <OMGOMG_> | tr "\n" "\0" | xargs -0
[22:16:18] <OMGOMG_> lol
[22:20:01] <earnestly> Ever so slightly more ported than xargs -d '\n'
[22:21:11] <FIlystyn> -0 makes sens since with new lines it will break on +\ argument

[22:28:09] <hyrcanus> then you need to find which of 13 terminal windows is associated with that process

[23:42:24] <yitz> Using (( var )) vs (( var > 0 )) occasionally runs into bugs when the var somehow gets negative. Obviously this isn't likely to happen with a len() but it does pop up on occasion in other codebases
