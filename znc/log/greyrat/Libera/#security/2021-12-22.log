However in the scenario where two systems are connected via a LAN then the risk

[03:22:38] <MakeForIt> ajak, It's intended as an IP security camera system. I don't trust the security cameras since they all carry vulnerabilities frankly (as can be seen by searching for virtually any brand), and thus I consider the system untrusted.
[03:24:07] <MakeForIt> It will have its own network switch that's separate from anything else. Originally planned for it to be near a wired monitor/kb/m but it would be more suitable in a more central location (camera wiring-wise), hence was looking for whether some remote solution could be secure.
[03:24:52] <MakeForIt> the cameras aren't connected to the net, only on their own LAN
[03:24:58] <ajak> yay, so instead of going in circles of theory we can talk specifics now :)

[03:25:25] <Meowyouth> THere are new cracked hypervisors that are being researched but al of that what you just mentioned is all nss and premandated code I guess...

[05:37:04] <Joanna> I think organizations do consider some people to be expendable
[05:37:21] <jkk> yep
[05:38:37] <mats1> maybe, but very dramatised by television and movies, ostensibly to discourage volunteers to foreign orgs
[05:39:03] *** Quits: arcatech (~arcatech@user/arcatech) (Quit: Bye.)
[05:39:04] <jkk> volunteer to where?
[05:40:25] <mats1> i.e. talented folks who receive payments for illicit technology transfers to foreign intel outfits
[05:41:02] <Joanna> Kamikaze pilots..
[05:41:28] <mats1> that was towards the end of the war
[05:42:03] <ajak> let's make complete thoughts rather than just saying vague phrases
[05:42:11] <mats1> few people today know that japanese pilots and planes were by far the best in the eastern theatre
[05:42:39] <jkk> mats1: intel orgs do set up their agents
[05:42:43] <jkk> for various reasons
[05:43:06] <jkk> for example scared that some may talk about drugs on planes etc
[05:43:07] <Joanna> Does anyone here like the Corbett report ?
[05:43:09] <ajak> mats1: yeah, US could've easily lost the pacific if not for some japanese missteps and american luck, especially around midway

[05:44:24] <jkk> or something in between
[05:44:31] <Joanna> I’ve heard that japan was manipulated into the war
[05:44:33] <ajak> i think it was 3/4 japanese CVs sunk in the battle? really insane luck for the americans
[05:44:36] <mats1> i'm tired of trying to massage this guy's noise into signal
[05:44:37] <jkk> Joanna: yep
[05:44:40] <mats1> bbl
[05:45:06] <ajak> Joanna: you've "heard"?
[05:45:17] <jkk> everyone knows drugs are smuggled on intel planes
[05:45:24] <Joanna> I wasn’t alive back then
[05:45:37] <jkk> Joanna: why arent you ancient spirit? :P
[05:45:58] <jkk> back in year 900000 BC life was different
