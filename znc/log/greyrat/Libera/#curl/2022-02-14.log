[00:59:53] <bagder> mattf: you need to make sure your version is selected at run-time, change /etc/ld.conf, set LD_LIBRARY_PATH or use -Wl when you link
[01:00:56] <mattf> bagder: can't i statically build this?
[01:01:03] <bagder> that's also an option
[01:01:13] <mattf> how do i do that
[01:03:21] *** Quits: WishBoy (~WishBoy@user/wishboy) ()
[01:05:11] <mattf> well when i ldd src/curl it says it is not dynamic already
[01:06:16] <mattf> /names
[01:06:16] <mattf>  
[01:06:36] <mattf> bagder: doesn't that mean it is statically built already?
[01:10:15] <bagder> if curl -V shows it but ldd doesn't, then it was linked statically
[01:14:28] <mattf> yes bagder then it is static
[01:14:32] <mattf> but still wrong version
[01:15:16] <bagder> then check config.log from your configure
[01:16:44] <mattf> bagder: http://ix.io/3Py8
[01:16:48] <mattf> is that the problem
[01:17:09] <mattf> why is it trying to compile brotli if i already have it compiled anyway
[01:17:37] <bagder> configure doesn't "try to compile", it checks for the lib
[01:18:10] <bagder> mattf: did you *install* brotli  in the /home/matheus/Programs/curl/brotli/out prefix?
[01:18:14] <mattf> yes
[01:18:17] <mattf> i just built it
[01:18:22] <bagder> so there's a lib and include dir in there?
[01:18:24] <mattf> there is an installed folder there though
[01:18:25] <mattf> yes
[01:18:33] <mattf> oh actually is is inside /installed
[01:18:37] <mattf> let me try
[01:18:51] <mattf> LDFLAGS=-Wl,-R/home/matheus/Programs/curl/brotli/out/installed/ ./configure --with-openssl --without-ldap-lib --with-libssh --with-brotli=/home/matheus/Programs/curl/brotli/out/installed/
[01:19:19] <bagder> that doesn't look right
[01:19:23] <mattf> http://ix.io/3Py9
[01:20:37] <bagder> the -R optin for ld should specify the dir where the lib is
[01:20:46] <bagder> --with-brotli should specify the *prefix*
[01:20:51] <mattf> what is a prefix
[01:20:59] <bagder> the dir in which there's a lib and include dir in
[01:21:05] <mattf> folder with bin, include, lib inside?
[01:21:06] <bagder> *not* the lib dir
[01:21:35] <bagder> $prefix/lib is the directory where the lib is, $prefix/include has the include file(s)
[01:21:49] <mattf> check my last paste
[01:22:13] <mattf> the prefix is the installed folder isn't it?
[01:22:29] <bagder> if you say so
[01:22:42] <mattf> no i mean, im not sure
[01:23:00] <mattf> the last paste contains the tree of that dir
[01:23:44] <bagder> yes, "installed" is the prefix
[01:23:58] <mattf> and -R should take installed/lib ?
[01:24:01] <bagder> yes
[01:24:30] <mattf> LDFLAGS=-Wl,-R/home/matheus/Programs/curl/brotli/out/installed/lib/ ./configure --with-openssl --without-ldap-lib --with-libssh --with-brotli=/home/matheus/Programs/curl/brotli/out/installed/
[01:26:17] <bagder> there should be a "-L/home/matheus/Programs/curl/brotli/out/installed/lib" option then among the LDFLAGS in the configure summary at the end
[01:26:20] <mattf> yay that worked
[01:26:32] <bagder> goodie
[01:36:49] <mattf> damn the bug wasn't what i thought it was

[13:20:08] <bagder> "PHP 8.0 bumped the min curl version to 7.29.0"
[13:21:40] <gevaerts> Modern!
[13:22:42] <icing> babysteps
[13:23:11] <bagder> less than a decade old! =)
[13:24:34] <kushal> Only
[13:25:03] <trippeh> same version as in EL7, thats probably why :)
[13:25:25] <bagder> yeah, that seems likely
[13:27:53] <gevaerts> The interesting question is, why is running php8 on EL7 just fine, but a modern curl is out of the question?
[13:29:50] <bagder> a fair question indeed
[13:30:08] <bagder> we often see that kind of behavior when users only upgrade a single particular component
[13:35:10] <kushal> I guess because of the ABI guarantee RHEL provides, you can not break the ABI, and curl is important in that way.
[13:35:15] <kushal> libcurl I mean
[13:36:01] <kushal> That was the reason we could not upgrade  packages in RHEL back in the days, I am guessing it is still the same.

[23:51:54] <pmn> problem is that i can't cmake to build boringssl _before_ starting to build curl, any ideas?
[23:52:33] <pmn> i gather this is where curl's CMakeLists.txt calls out to find_package() : https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/70ac27604a2abfa809a7b2736506af0da8c3c8a9/CMakeLists.txt#L435
