[06:41:29] <CoolerX> Hi
[06:41:31] <johnkeats6> NewbieCatser, isn't it the whole point of category theory to deal with that
[06:41:57] <CoolerX> What are the rules for polynomial long division in GF(2^8)?
[06:42:01] <CoolerX> when do you stop?
[06:42:30] <CoolerX> do you stop when the degree of the dividend polynomial becomes less than the degree of the divisor polynomial?
[06:42:56] *** Joins: millido (~millido@84.210.150.128)
[06:43:26] <xor2> I believe so, the dividend would be part of the remainder then
[06:43:35] <CoolerX> ok
[06:43:56] *** Quits: ProfSimm (~ProfSimm@87.227.196.109) (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:44:02] <CoolerX> also regarding normal polynomial division
[06:44:58] <CoolerX> in each step in the long division you multiply the divisor by a scalar times X^p and subtract it from the dividend
[06:45:43] *** Joins: Al-Khwarizmi (~Al-Khwari@d24-57-234-201.home.cgocable.net)
[06:45:51] <xor2> Mhm, I think the only difference for a finite field would be how you subtract it exactly
[06:45:57] <CoolerX> if the dividend is   3x^4 + 2x^2 + 1 and the divisor is x+1 then you multiply it by 3x^3 to make it 3x^4 + 3x^3
[06:46:10] <CoolerX> and then subtract that right?
[06:46:18] <CoolerX> even though in this case the divisor is larger
[06:46:38] <CoolerX> so you get negative coefficients after subtraction
[06:47:16] <CoolerX> the dividend becomes -3x^3 + 2x^2 + 1 after subtraction
[06:48:10] <CoolerX> which seems weird to me, compared to long division on real numbers
[06:50:35] <xor2> only the degrees of the polynomials are relevant to "larger" and "smaller"
[06:50:55] <xor2> Which honestly is weird, but that's how the math ended up I suppose
[06:51:57] <xor2> the dividend should have a lower degree at every step, so eventually it ends
[06:52:17] <CoolerX> ok
[06:52:27] <CoolerX> xor2, the divisor you mean
[06:53:02] <xor2> I'm not used to the terms, the numerator of the division
[06:57:19] <CoolerX> that's the dividend
[06:57:59] <CoolerX> the dividend should have a higher degree in each step
[06:58:07] <CoolerX> higher than the divisor
[06:58:36] <xor2> higher than the divisor, but lower than the previous step
[07:01:42] <NewbieCatser> johnkeats6 i don’t know, is it?

[09:51:54] <riv> if M is the free monoid on some alphabet, and S is a subset, the right quotient of S by m in M is defined as S / m = { u in M | u m in S }
[09:52:47] <riv> so we can see that (S / m) m <= S
[09:53:50] <riv> with this we can define the syntactic equivalence relation,  s ~S t  :<=>  S/s = S/t

[10:03:17] <Al-Khwarizmi> stanrifkin: yes.
[10:03:35] <stanrifkin> Al-Khwarizmi: only one street leads to wonderland so only 100 or 010 or 001 can be true
[10:03:54] <Al-Khwarizmi> it comes from the "exactly one of the three answers can be true". Im just listing the propositions
[10:04:23] <stanrifkin> Al-Khwarizmi: the 3 guardians making statements. mark them.
[10:04:36] <stanrifkin> Al-Khwarizmi: in the truth table i mean
[10:04:48] <Al-Khwarizmi> can't use a truth table. Strictly formal proof
[10:04:57] <stanrifkin> ok.
[10:05:06] <Al-Khwarizmi> is my formalization correct?
[10:05:17] <stanrifkin> i don't know now
[10:05:42] <riv> So we can also define a double sided version of this called the Myhill-congruence. s =S t  iff  forall x,y in M,  x s y in S  iff  x t y in S
[10:06:37] *** Quits: audiobirb (~audio@user/audio) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[10:06:51] <riv> What if we take x,y = identity. then s in S iff t in S. I guess we must have both in or both out of S.
[10:07:38] <riv> but not only that, no multiplication by monoid elements can take t and s in or out differently
[10:07:48] <riv> i.e. if x s y takes s out, it has to take t out too
[10:08:03] <riv> because it's an equivalence class
[10:09:22] <riv> so the words of S are put into classes that will basically recognize if they can be matched or not I think. Can I deduce that there are two classes?
[10:10:39] <riv> No there's not always 2 classes
[10:10:45] <ski> hm, is the equivalence relation only defined on ⌜S⌝ ?
[10:11:43] <riv> yes I think it is just defined for S
[10:11:52] <ski> curious
[10:12:02] <riv> the key fact is that the equivalence classes respect the monoid operation
[10:12:18] <riv> which lets us form the syntactic monoid M(S) = M/~S
[10:12:37] *** Joins: jmdaemon (~jmdaemon@user/jmdaemon)
[10:12:49] <riv> that means we do need it defined for all M?
[10:15:15] <riv> yes I think the definition will work fine as a relation on M
[10:15:45] <riv> so suppose a,b,x,y in M. a =S x, b =S y. I want to show ab =S xy
[10:15:55] <riv> actually
[10:16:10] <riv> a,b,u,v in M. a =S u, b =S v. I want to show ab =S uv
[10:17:07] <riv> we have:  [x a y in S  iff  x u y in S] [x b y in S  iff  x v y in S]
[10:17:09] <ski> looks like it'll work
[10:17:18] <riv> want to show  [x a b y in S  iff  x u v y in S]
[10:17:51] <riv> and indeed we can use by for y in the first one, and vy in the first one, and join them using the second
[10:17:56] <ski> instantiate ⌜y⌝ for one, and ⌜x⌝ for the other, to swap out both parts
[10:18:17] <riv> ah that's neater ty

[10:25:18] <riv> this semigroup is said to be equivalent to the transition automata of a minimal DFA

[21:47:09] <cadmio> I think that's the way my text's proof goes
[21:47:49] <isekaijin> Say f(x) is your polynomial. Since it has a root, say b1, you can write f(x) = (x - b1) f1(x). Then again, f1(x) is either constant or has a root... inductively, you have f(x) = (x - b1) (x - b2) ... (x - bn) c, where c is a constant.
[21:48:31] <johnkeats7> Guest1778, get wolfram to do it for you
[21:49:31] <isekaijin> cadmio: So, what I have just shown is that “every nonconstant polynomial in K[x] has a root” if and only if “every polynomial in K[x] splits into a product of linear factors”.
[21:50:17] <cadmio> in that proof is proving that A is closed by showing that every poly in A[x] of degree n>= 1 has root
[21:50:22] <cadmio> what's the role of K?
[21:50:28] <isekaijin> ?
[21:50:31] <isekaijin> What's A here?
[21:50:47] <node1> When we say `discrete object` are not we refering to finite set of object?
[21:50:48] <isekaijin> I haven't used the letter A in this conversation.
[21:51:11] <isekaijin> node1: When we say “discrete space”, we mean a space with the discrete topology. It doesn't have to be finite or even countable.
[21:51:14] <node1> or it can be finite or infinite both?
[21:51:16] <cadmio> at the end of the page Theorem 5.21.25 https://gioretikto.github.io/mat/algebra/field_extension.html
[21:51:39] <node1> finite or countable are same
[21:51:40] *** Joins: dyeplexer (~dyeplexer@user/dyeplexer)
[21:51:55] <isekaijin> cadmio: Ah, that's what I called \bar{Q} before.
[21:52:51] <isekaijin> The field of algebraic numbers is algebraically closed pretty much by definition: it's constructed by starting with Q and then adding every possible root of a polynomial with coefficients in Q.
[21:52:52] <cadmio> it's not proving that in A[x] every element has a root (for noncostants)
[21:53:50] <Z-module> It turns out that if you start with a field K (any field), and adjoin a root of each nonconstant poly in K[x] to K, the new larger field L is automatically alg. closed -- it contains roots of not just all the nonconstant things in K[x] but even all the ones in L[x].  It's kind of neat.
[21:54:23] <cadmio> so those a_i are roots of polys in A[x]
[21:54:36] <isekaijin> cadmio: It is a basic fact that, if E/F is an algebraic extension, and x is algebraic over E, then x is algebraic over F.
[21:55:52] <isekaijin> cadmio: In particular, if A is the field of algebraic numbers, then A/Q is an algebraic extension. So, if x is algebraic over A, then x is algebraic over Q, hence x is an element of A.

[21:57:24] <cadmio> I'm not sure why at some point it stops considering A and it considers only Q() and K(s)
[21:58:13] <isekaijin> Because, if x is algebraic over A, then x satisfies a polynomial equation with coefficients in A.
[21:58:21] <cadmio> sure
[21:58:29] <isekaijin> We have finitely many coefficients, which generate an intermediate extension between Q and A.
[21:58:48] <isekaijin> This intermediate extension is a proper subfield of A, because it is, in fact, finite over Q.
[21:58:57] <cadmio> so A is a sort of C
[21:59:12] <isekaijin> ?

[21:59:54] <isekaijin> It's true that A is a subfield of C.
[22:00:41] <cadmio> I thought that as a concrete example you could substitute A by C
[22:01:03] <isekaijin> A and C are two different examples of algebraically closed fields.
[22:01:16] <isekaijin> But that doesn't mean that you can substitute one for the other in all situations.
[22:01:25] <isekaijin> They are, well... different.
