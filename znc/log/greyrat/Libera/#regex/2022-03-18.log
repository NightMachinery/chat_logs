[13:00:42] <re101-gar-46> Hi everyone, I would like to create a regex that selects all characters with exception of alphabetic letters, numbers and the character ";". When I useÂ  in R gsub with regex [^-A-Za-z0-9]) it works as excepted for the alphabetic letters, numbers. When I extend the regex for the ";" like that ([^-A-Za-z0-9-;]) I get an error (Invalid character
[13:00:43] <re101-gar-46> range). How can I create a valide regex that considers the ";" ?
[13:03:41] <farn> re101-gar-46: you probably want [^A-Za-z0-9;]
[13:03:50] <farn> no - between ^ and A or between 9 and ;
[13:04:15] <re101-gar-46> Thanks. Yeah, it works :)
[13:04:15] <farn> you're not trying to exclude the characters between 9 and ;

[20:33:35] <muffin_storm> but it only accounts for space after the comma

[20:34:33] <muffin_storm> so if the last string doesnt end with ,
[20:34:37] <muffin_storm> will need fixing to match

[20:54:07] <purplex> interesting reex, not sure what he wanted..
[20:54:11] <purplex> regex*
[20:54:31] <muffin_storm> just to match everything after >,
[20:55:02] <purplex> does it need to be comma separated or just everything?
[20:55:08] <muffin_storm> think so yea
[20:55:21] <muffin_storm> thats how he had it
[20:55:34] <purplex> which one comma or, just everything? :p
[20:55:56] <muffin_storm> not sure
[20:55:58] <muffin_storm> https://regex101.com/r/1rivSO/2
[20:56:02] <muffin_storm> that was his example
[20:56:05] <purplex> cool
[20:56:12] <muffin_storm> he provided the test strings
[20:56:33] <purplex> yeah he didn't say much, but it worked for him
[20:56:49] <muffin_storm> think he just wanted to exclude 'head >, ' on every line
[20:57:00] <muffin_storm> and match everything after
[20:58:18] <purplex> cool strategy you used though
[20:58:30] <muffin_storm> I just used https://regex-generator.olafneumann.org/

[21:01:26] <muffin_storm> he originally provided his test string in quotes
[21:01:32] <muffin_storm> but don't think his actual strings have them
[21:02:14] <purplex> no multiple paste?

[22:15:13] <RedAero> Hi
[22:16:01] <RedAero> I'm using Python (Pandas), and I want to find any strings which have any characters NOT in the first block (ASCII) of Unicode. What is the most efficient way of doing so?
[22:16:25] <RedAero> I know I can specify code point ranges, the question is how should I do so to optimize performance
[22:17:18] <Guest72> how can I match the letters and numbers that is not part of an ordering number and eliminate the period https://regex101.com/r/pwoJrt/1
[22:17:20] <Guest72> ?
[22:19:12] <purplex> Guest72: looks like a jumbled text, which aren't part of ordering?
[22:20:12] <Guest72> Its true I could redo some of this.
[22:20:19] <Guest72> I will edit

[22:21:58] <Guest72> https://regex101.com/r/FmeTGD/1
[22:22:18] <Guest72> how can I match the letters and numbers that is not part of an ordering number and eliminate the periods
[22:22:39] <Guest72> The test is provided with different orders and spacing and periods
[22:22:49] <OnlineCop> Do you necessarily want the `\s` at the end, or simply a word boundary?
[22:23:45] <purplex> do you consider 3 and 5 without a . following them part of ordering?
[22:23:46] <OnlineCop> Do you specifically not want numbers in the matches, or "only digits" but any word that contains numbers?
[22:24:10] <Guest72> word boundary is ok. Want to end with a string in the different examples. The tricky thing is that the individual can put a number that is relevant before or after a word
[22:24:38] <Guest72> so for example here you see 100 db charlie or charlie 100 dbg
[22:24:39] <OnlineCop> So... you want to match the digits before words, and replace them with "nothing" to remove them?
[22:24:41] <Guest72> can be relevant
[22:24:59] <Guest72> but the 1. 2 3 etc. are not relevant
[22:25:20] <Guest72> so dont want to select those
[22:25:28] <OnlineCop> Line 13: "  100charlie" <-- you want to keep the '100' before 'charlie'?
[22:25:33] <Guest72> yes
[22:25:57] <OnlineCop> Line 3: '3charlie' <-- you do NOT want to keep the '3' before 'charlie'?
[22:26:02] <Guest72> but not if: charlie is followed by an associated number

[22:26:07] <OnlineCop> What's the difference in these two? Just the number of digits?
[22:26:27] <purplex> its not what i'd exactly call ordering..
[22:26:32] <Guest72> yes 3 charlie would not be selected
[22:26:34] <OnlineCop> Perhaps, digits from 1-99, with or without a trailing '.' ?
[22:26:41] <Guest72> Its natural language use case
[22:27:07] <Guest72> it will generally follow the same pattern but I dont know which one a person will use
[22:27:16] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/FmeTGD/2
[22:28:08] <Guest72> yes, but actually I misunderstood earlier example, dont want to have 3 before charlie
[22:28:17] <Guest72> in Line3
[22:28:41] <Guest72> and in Line 1
[22:28:57] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/FmeTGD/3
[22:31:39] <OnlineCop> If that's removing what you expect it to, you can then use Code Generator (https://regex101.com/r/FmeTGD/3/codegen?language=python) to get some nearly-copy-pasteable code.
[22:31:43] <Guest72> that looks good
[22:32:05] <Guest72> but will [^] work to select revers
[22:32:09] <Guest72> reverse?
[22:32:15] <Guest72> everything except those?
[22:32:26] <OnlineCop> No, [^] wouldn't work in this case.
[22:32:55] <Guest72> How would I select opposite?
[22:33:04] <Guest72> everything other than those characters?
[22:33:35] <purplex> whats the end goal..
[22:33:36] <OnlineCop> I personally wouldn't. I'd sub() out these unwanted characters, unless there's a specific reason you need them, and then the remaining text would contain what you want.
[22:34:14] <Guest72> Understood. It looks like the last number in line1 was not reached but maybe because it wasnt in sequence. I replaced in sequence in this link https://regex101.com/r/WRCsV3/1
[22:34:14] <OnlineCop> It's possible to do in Python, but would be a lot more complicated and harder to adjust when you get edge cases.
[22:34:28] <Guest72> but 6. in line 1 not highlighted
[22:34:36] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/FmeTGD/4
[22:34:40] <OnlineCop> !update
[22:35:09] <OnlineCop> You want to use the "Update regex" link instead of the "Save regex" so you get the nice /1, /2, /3, etc. revision numbers at the end.
[22:36:39] <Guest72> Wow thats impressive!
[22:38:53] <OnlineCop> The hardest part about doing "the reverse" of this, is knowing when a number should be kept together with the text (like "100" in "100charlie") or separated (like "3" in "3charlie").
[22:45:16] <Guest72> I cant get this to work inside google, is there something in the REGEX that goole wouldnt recognize?
[22:45:17] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/FmeTGD/5
[22:45:27] <OnlineCop> I thought you said it was for Python?
[22:45:45] <Guest72> sorry
[22:45:58] <Guest72> someone might have mentioned python, not me
[22:46:02] <Guest72> but let me try that formuula
[22:46:24] <OnlineCop> Oh, sorry. That was RedAero who mentioned Python/Pandas.
[22:47:02] <OnlineCop> RedAero: Could you provide some examples on regex101 so I could see what you're trying to do? "This should match..." and "This should not match..." helps a lot.
[22:47:38] <OnlineCop> Guest72: When you say "Google", which variant? Google Docs? Spreadsheet? Golang? PCRE?
[22:48:39] <Guest72> spreadsheets using formula like REGEXREPLACE(C143,"[INSERT REGEX]","")
[22:48:53] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/FmeTGD/6
[22:49:16] <OnlineCop> They probably don't accept the (?!...) lookahead notation.
[22:49:32] <purplex> yea they don't
[22:49:44] <OnlineCop> The [^.] at the end is really ugly, and probably won't match at the end of lines (unless it's matching \n).
