[00:00:22] <zebrag> Problem is, links created by `C-c C-l / C-c l` like `[[id:3c5997f1-205a-437e-8722-d5f52239a207][bye]]` are both external and internal?
[00:00:31] <zebrag> no there is a bug in the translation of that
[00:00:36] <zebrag> according to nicolas
[00:01:27] <zebrag> it shouldn't be translated into `<a href="bye.org#ID-3c5997f1-205a-437e-8722-d5f52239a207">bye</a>`
[00:03:24] <zebrag> it should be translated into `<a href="bye.org#orgfa9c151">bye</a>`

[00:15:59] <zebrag> So it is a case of internal link which is broken when exporting. And that shouldn't happen according to Nicolas and the mentioned ML thread.
[00:16:26] <zebrag> So I think I'm "entitled" to "complain" about it?

[02:04:48] <zebrag> I was thinking of: "is it to be expected that internal links break at publishing time under this and that specific condition?"
[02:05:36] <zebrag> And that I totally agree with the links not being stable through publishing process.
[02:06:01] <zebrag> And quoting https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2021-05/msg01254.html
[02:06:35] <zebrag> And https://orgmode.org/list/E1jxAjq-0004Dk-LH@lists.gnu.org/, with the legitimate though specific "noise" argument.
[02:07:39] <zebrag> In any case I've got quite a lot to read before escalating to ML.
[02:08:05] <zebrag> Thanks to all the good references you provided.
[02:09:49] <zebrag> But that thing of uuid as links: imo it's a very powerful yet simple and realistic idea.
[02:12:47] <zebrag> That and org-ref, that Kitchin is totally rewriting, if I remember correctly...
[02:13:51] <zebrag> And you have a very powerful note taking framework.
[02:14:45] <zebrag> So, in some way, if I can have it working, everything is already here, and I don't need an additional layer.
[02:17:21] <Demosthenex> zebrag: i've been taking notes, managing projects, and writing customer documentation in org since 2006.
[02:17:29] <Demosthenex> and... i've never needed org-id.
[02:17:45] <Demosthenex> the FIRST thing that ever did ID's was org-caldav to upload to my phone agenda items
[02:18:02] <Demosthenex> and i was rather miffed it had to go add an id and drawer to EVERY header in my agenda files...

[02:38:10] *** Quits: ngz (~ngz@user/ngz) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[02:41:29] <zebragg> Usually, I take a sheet of paper, I use every bits of it with short notes, being specific on each time using a distant part of the sheet, and likely writing with different orientation, so I can't read what is elsewhere on the sheet of paper, then/simultaneously, I draw boxes and boundaries around the would be sections, then I add numbers, and arrows.
[02:42:02] <zebragg> It goes without saying that I have a very limited stretch of time to make use of it.
[02:42:46] <zebragg> After which the would be notes won't mean anything anymore.
[02:43:16] <zebragg> So I think I can make use of org-id.

[02:56:10] <zebrag> There are functions that add id to every existing headlines

[03:09:38] <Demosthenex> zebrag: so i have to say, recently with the zettlekasten craze i've seen so many people talk about how they can't possibly take notes without it...
[03:09:44] <Demosthenex> including complex org addons.

[18:41:17] <empwilli> is there a goto solution for having subfigure export to latex?
[18:41:44] <Demosthenex> empwilli: you'll have to be more specific
[18:43:28] <empwilli> I'd like to have an org document that exports to latex with 3 images exported next to each other in a figure environment, each of which as a subfigure 
[18:43:42] <empwilli> or do i have to plug in plain latex code?
[18:44:17] <empwilli> i.e. subfigures with respective captions/labels :)

[18:46:07] <Demosthenex> i think you'll have to do that directly inlatex.
[18:46:28] <empwilli> ok thank's :)
[18:47:26] <empwilli> i don't want to complain but i always find it interesting for what parts there are readily available (admitibly high quality) solutions and for other parts there are not :)
[18:52:41] <Demosthenex> well, it's a wrapper for common operations
[18:52:48] <Demosthenex> at least it's easy to dig deepr
[18:55:11] <empwilli> :)

[21:24:43] <nws> Hello! I've been trying to get a little more into org-mode lately. One thing I haven't been able to figure out is now to fill a paragraph so that it pads lines with 2 spaces on the left like it does when you're typing normally in org-mode. org-fill-paragraph makes the first line indented at 2 spaces, and the rest of the lines have no indentation at
[21:24:43] <nws> all.
