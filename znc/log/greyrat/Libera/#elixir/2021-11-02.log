[15:08:20] <LostKobrakai_> josevalim the 0.3 release for liveview looks really nice. I'm wondering what your goals are with the file system abstraction. I've been working on https://github.com/elixir-depot/depot on/off for a while and it seems there quite the overlap with what was added to livebook
[15:12:36] <serafeim> hello i've got an ecto schema with a many to many relation with another,  `Tag schema: many_to_many :tags, Tag, join_through: "tags", on_replace: :delete`
[15:13:26] <serafeim> when I try to delete this when there are related entries to the many to many join table I get a `constraint error when attempting to delete struct:` 
[15:13:41] <serafeim> is is possible to somehow cascade-delete these ? 
[15:14:08] <serafeim> or if not possible to cascade delete is it possible to check that deleting will throw and handle it gracefully ?

[15:22:20] <serafeim> thanks Nicd i saw it now. it proposes to use the migration though: https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Schema.html#has_many/3
[15:22:26] <serafeim> any way to handle the error gracefully ?

[15:48:27] <serafeim> because i may want to tell the user that what he wants to delete is used elsewhere

[15:49:49] *** Joins: brauliobz (~manjaro-u@user/brauliobz)
[15:50:18] <Nicd> you can check it yourself beforehand or you can catch the error and pretty print it. I don't know if there is a feature to automatically convert the constraint error to an error message like with unique errors
[15:51:44] <LostKobrakai> I'd consider taking another look at the UX here. As a user I wouldn't ever expect deleting a post to delete actual tags (only the link of the post to certain tags)

[15:59:49] <serafeim> no no i don't want to delete the tags when the post is deleted
[16:00:08] <Nicd> is this about blog posts?
[16:00:13] <serafeim> Nicd: not really
[16:00:16] <serafeim> but it's the same
[16:00:27] <serafeim> there's an m2m relation between post and tags so there's a join table
[16:00:38] <Nicd> I wouldn't expect it to deny me from deleting a post if tags exist either
[16:00:42] <serafeim> now maybe i would want to delete the entries from the join table 
[16:00:58] <Nicd> yes, you would cascade to the join table, not the tag table
[16:01:03] <serafeim> or maybe i would want to tell the user "there are entries in the join table for this post, remove them before deleting"
[16:01:13] <Nicd> that would be annoying
[16:01:18] <benwilson512_> also
[16:01:20] <serafeim> i understand that for the first case i would do it with the migration
[16:01:23] <benwilson512_> I'd consider not _actually_ deleting anything
[16:01:26] <serafeim> as Nicd recommended
[16:01:29] <benwilson512_> and just setting a deleted_at
[16:01:39] <serafeim> benwilson512_: yes that's another thing. but let's suppose i know the consequences
[16:01:49] <benwilson512_> then just go with the db level cascade
[16:02:01] <serafeim> benwilson512_: but why not notify the user ? 
[16:02:22] <serafeim> i think ecto is supposed to have these
[16:02:26] <benwilson512_> because if the user intends to delete a post, they don't care about your implementation of taggings
[16:02:31] <LostKobrakai> Yeah, either the join table is just an implementation detail e.g. for post <-> tags, then just delete the relationship
[16:02:32] <benwilson512_> tags on a post are part of a post
[16:02:37] <benwilson512_> from the end user perspective
[16:02:50] <LostKobrakai> or the join table has some actual use in your domain, then don't cascade, but warn users
[16:02:50] <serafeim> i.e my expection tells me this: https://dpaste.org/aBTH
[16:02:52] <benwilson512_> who goes "oh, never mind, I didn't realize this post had tags, I don't want to delete it anymore" ?

[16:03:23] <serafeim> benwilson512_: :) let's not discuss about UX things please. just about the implementation
[16:03:30] <benwilson512_> a user confirmation _is_ UX
[16:03:33] <benwilson512_> you're asking a UX question
[16:03:44] <benwilson512_> "but why not notify the user ? "
[16:03:48] <serafeim> let's suppose iv'e got an m2m relation. and i want to notify the user when he wants to delete a member of that relation that has instances in the join table.
[16:04:00] <serafeim> i don't want to throw an exception nor cascade
[16:04:08] <benwilson512_> you aren't throwing an exception, ecto is
[16:04:12] <benwilson512_> catch the exception, handle accordingly
[16:04:23] <serafeim> no no i don't want to catch the exception either
[16:04:37] <LostKobrakai> the default should be to rais
[16:04:44] <serafeim> can't i use a changeset to handle that ?
[16:04:47] <Nicd> if you want to pre-check it, do it with a manual query. otherwise do as the error says
[16:04:55] <serafeim> like ecto proposes ?
[16:05:18] <serafeim> for example there's this: https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Changeset.html#no_assoc_constraint/3 
[16:05:23] <serafeim> can't i use it for my m2m ? 
[16:05:27] <benwilson512_> I believe the ecto error is wrong
[16:05:30] <benwilson512_> or at least
[16:05:32] <benwilson512_> incomplete
[16:05:42] <benwilson512_> I don't believe it can be used to catch constraint raises from _other_ tables
[16:05:43] <serafeim> benwilson512_: yes i couldn't make it work using what ecto is proposing
[16:05:58] <serafeim> ah so it probably isn't supported
[16:06:26] <Nicd> err the example shows using it on a reference to another table
[16:06:29] <LostKobrakai> Generally if the join table is not just an implementation detail I'd suggest not using many_to_many in the first place
[16:06:56] <LostKobrakai> Things get way more explicit once you stop using it
[16:07:05] <serafeim> LostKobrakai: what would i use ? add a schema for that table with foreign keys ?
[16:07:10] <LostKobrakai> Exactly
[16:07:15] <serafeim> all right i guess
[16:07:24] <Nicd> why can't serafeim use no_assoc_constraint?
[16:07:26] <benwilson512_> Nicd: ah! I went to the wrong function, I looked at the constraint_function
[16:07:35] <benwilson512_> no_assoc_constraint I had not seen before
[16:07:38] <benwilson512_> you are right
[16:07:39] <Nicd> oh yeah it's has_*
[16:07:42] <benwilson512_> that ought to work
[16:07:45] <serafeim> ok i understand i just wanted to know if there was a way to use it with ecto and changeset. 
[16:07:47] <serafeim> benwilson512_: i couldn'
[16:07:50] <serafeim> benwilson512_: i couldn't make it work :(
[16:08:09] <serafeim> i will just catch the exception... or do the cascade i'll think about it

[16:09:14] <LostKobrakai> it's meant to make m2m as an implementation detail less verbose

[18:52:16] <hoppity> It's hard to say this kind of thing without sounding rude which is not my intention at all, but this float feature just seems useless. I wonder why it was put in place and what was the reasoning behind it.
[18:53:08] <Ankhers> I believe when you print something, it uses the String.Chars protocol. If you use `to_string(4000.0)` it does the same thing.

[18:55:19] <rawtaz> hoppity: it's simply becaues thats a very common and established notation for floats, and you have to keep in mind that not everyone has small numbers, it's quite common to have larger numbers wher eit makes little sense to print like tens of digits :)
[18:55:35] <rawtaz> that said, there will always be disappointed users :<
[18:57:07] <hoppity> rawtaz: and I am far from dissapointed, I love Elixir, I just feel like if you want exponent notation you could pass your variable to a float_to_exp() function or something like that instead of the beavior being default and having to override it if you don't want it.

[19:04:51] <LostKobrakai> hoppity afaik the goal is to print the smallest notation, which for simple floats often is the exponent notation

[19:05:49] <hoppity> Thank you
[19:06:14] <LostKobrakai> 4.0e3 is a character shorter than 4000.0
[19:07:57] <hoppity> Absolutely, and of course I appreciate the thought behind wanting to make it shorter. But for example, in my case, building a Phoenix app, I am showing a table with float values to my users and of course they have no idea what 4.0e3 means.
[19:08:49] <hoppity> So I'm like.. that's weird. I investigate and it turns out I have to now pass all my table rows which are 500 through a to_binary() function in order to get 4.0e3 to *not* show up.
[19:09:40] <hoppity> And as I said,  not a big deal at all. Just feels unelegant.
[19:10:38] <hoppity> Maybe exponent notation works for the dev during development time, but I hardly see it being accepable for an end user.

[22:44:29] <hoppity> benwilson512_: https://dpaste.org/JSYz
[22:45:06] <benwilson512_> hoppity: yeah you can't put associations in the select
[22:45:14] <benwilson512_> particularly has many, there isn't any kind of implicit grouping that way
[22:45:18] <benwilson512_> that's the function of `preload`
[22:45:40] <benwilson512_> you can `preload: [foo: thing_you_joined]`
[22:45:44] <hoppity> I see, but then if I preload, I only get my actual exact struct and can't "select" at all right?
[22:46:18] <benwilson512_> uh you could preload from a subquery
[22:46:21] <benwilson512_> and select in that subquery

[22:48:25] <benwilson512_> it isn't easy because the SQL for that isn't easy either
[22:48:40] <benwilson512_> ecto preload has to do a ton of post processing on the results in order to make it seem like you can do this
[22:48:49] <benwilson512_> but sql just returns rows, not rows underneath other rows
[22:49:09] <benwilson512_> if you don't want to use the preloading feature with actual structs you're gonna have to do some of that postprocessing yourself

[22:53:53] <OliverMT> but if you're new and got something working and you're using parameterized queries still, then go for it
[22:54:07] <OliverMT> you'd get some pointed comments if I was your code reviewer though
[22:54:15] <hoppity> OliverMT: thank you
[22:54:32] <hoppity> I am new and don't even know what parameterized queries are
[22:54:46] <OliverMT> how do you pass parameters to the query?
[22:55:12] <OliverMT> as long as you dont do "WHERE foo.bar = " <> your_unescaped_variable_here <> " .. more stuff"
[22:55:13] <hoppity> in this particular case I am not passing anything to my query
[22:55:14] <OliverMT> you are good
[22:55:17] <OliverMT> ah ok then you're good
[22:55:27] <hoppity> thanks :)
[22:55:29] <benwilson512_> errrr
[22:55:32] <benwilson512_> yea
[22:55:37] <benwilson512_> that seems like an orthogonal thing
[22:55:47] <benwilson512_> hoppity: running multiple queries and then massaging the data is 100% fine
[22:55:54] <OliverMT> the biggest foot gun of manual querying is parameters
[22:56:05] <hoppity> benwilson512_: thank  you
[22:56:09] <OliverMT> benwilson512_: I have superb conundrum for you on your absinthe chan on slack :D
[22:56:25] <OliverMT> I am re-typing my code from scratch now to see if I'm just stupid
