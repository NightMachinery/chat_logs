[04:23:11] <aokskjd> touch: invalid date format...
[04:23:17] <aokskjd> touch -d? let me try
[04:23:33] <Blondie101010> wasn't the intention to use another file's timestamp?
[04:23:40] <e36freak> -d should take the stat %x output
[04:23:45] <e36freak> if both utils are gnu
[04:23:46] <pj> touch -r, no need for stat
[04:23:54] <Blondie101010> definitely
[04:24:17] <emanuele6> pj: it's checking the same file, and the goal is to set the modification time to the access time
[04:24:30] <pj> oh
[04:24:37] <e36freak> weird thing to want to do though
[04:24:45] <Blondie101010> omg that's weird
[04:25:17] <pj> that sounds like an xy
[04:25:19] <Blondie101010> it prevents a lot of sanity control and simple change tracking
[04:27:11] <pj> why do that when you can just use the mtime and atime properly?  also atime is not exactly reliable, some filesystems don't support it, and it can and often times is disabled in mount with the noatime option.
[04:27:56] * e36freak mounts with noatime
[04:28:45] <aokskjd> touch -md did not work
[04:29:02] <emanuele6> aokskjd: -md@
[04:29:10] <emanuele6> (i am guessing that is the issue)
[04:29:36] <emanuele6> no, it should just work.

[04:30:29] <emanuele6> oh, no nevermind, i was right
[04:30:32] <emanuele6> you want the @
[04:30:42] <e36freak> stat's %x format is literally the example given in touch's info page for -d
[04:30:52] <emanuele6> otherwise 12 is interpreted as the 12th hour of the current day
[04:30:53] <e36freak> fwiw
[04:31:04] <emanuele6> GNU touch -d is like GNU date -d
[04:31:20] <emanuele6> @number is seconds since the epoch
[04:31:32] <e36freak> sure, i'm just saying that the %x output is exactly the same as the example for touch -d
[04:31:37] <e36freak> therefore it should definitely work
[04:32:51] <emanuele6> i think you mean %X
[04:33:21] <emanuele6> %X is human output and %x is seconds since 1970

[04:33:50] <emanuele6> oh, oops
[04:34:08] <aokskjd> Adding `@` works, but
[04:34:12] <e36freak> For example, ‘--date="2020-07-21 14:19:13.489392193 +0530"’ specifies the
[04:34:16] <e36freak> (from info touch)
[04:34:57] <emanuele6> touch -m -d "$(stat -c@%X -- "$file")" -- "$file"
[04:35:01] <emanuele6> something like that should work
[04:35:06] <aokskjd> The output of `stat -c '%X' <file>` matches `stat -c '%Y' <file>. However, `stat -c '%x' <file>` matches `stat -c '%y' <file> still do not match.
[04:35:25] <aokskjd> The last few numbers from the human readable output of stat does not match for modification and access times.
[04:35:37] <aokskjd> How can I fix this?
[04:35:40] <e36freak> because you're accessing the file again by checking it
[04:35:50] <emanuele6> probably because you are accessing the file with stat
[04:35:50] <e36freak> this is why atime is bad

[04:36:51] <aokskjd> Now when I sort by date, they are in the wrong order.
[04:36:55] <aokskjd> Yes
[04:36:59] <e36freak> epoch time doesn't have that kind of resolution
[04:37:09] <aokskjd> How can I fix the last part then?
[04:37:12] <e36freak> then u-e touch -md "$(stat -c %x "$file")" -- "$file"
[04:37:22] <e36freak> like i've been suggesting
[04:37:31] <aokskjd> I must have missed that, let me try.
[04:37:36] <emanuele6> oh, right so if you set with %X, you won't be able to set that

[05:23:45] <Thanatermesis> ah, it was the inverse, not with !
[05:25:07] <emanuele6> mind that [[ -t 0 ]] only checks that stdin is a tty

[08:23:42] <ormaaj> not a valid expansion
[08:24:06] <lgflorentino> Could anyone help me describe what happens with the ${(%):-%x} part
[08:24:11] <ormaaj> er you can't use them like that
[08:24:20] <lgflorentino> its coming from a script
[08:24:21] <emanuele6> that code is probably using BASH_SOURCE to detect if the shell is bash (for some reason it is not using BASH)
[08:24:24] <lgflorentino> its not my code
[08:24:33] <emanuele6> and running ${(%):-%x} that i am guessing is zsh code
[08:24:38] <emanuele6> in case the shell is not bash
[08:24:53] <ormaaj> looks zsh like yes
[08:25:39] <lgflorentino> the invocation at the top of script is /bin/bash :/
[08:25:46] <ormaaj> Not even sure that's totally safe
[08:25:51] <lgflorentino> ok
[08:26:30] <lgflorentino> I think its just doing the normal cd $0 && pwd command but with some extra stuff
[08:27:58] <emanuele6> that's probably in case someone runs the script as `zsh scriptpath'
[08:28:27] <emanuele6> i have no idea, but probably `${(%):-%x}' is a zsh expansion similar to $BASH_SOURCE
[08:28:32] <lgflorentino> oh i see
[08:28:40] <lgflorentino> thanks I'll test with zsh
[08:28:43] <ormaaj> The inner expansion being invalid bash will either see the first closing brace token and use that leaving you with a trailing }, or it'll just fail to parse on the ( metacharacter i'd guess
[08:29:31] <emanuele6> there is a #zsh channel

[13:59:29] <tirnanog> point being, it explains why a garbage collector isn't intrinsically required above and beyond a simple "no, it doesn't have one".
[14:00:18] <ormaaj> The implementation might make that a pain in the arse probably due to bison or the way it's used. That falls under program architecture fail. Nothing to do with the language.
[14:01:15] <ormaaj> it doesn't really.
[14:03:23] <tirnanog> in what way was not supporting manual memory allocation an explanation, then? there are plenty of languages that don't support manual memory allocation but whose runtimes incorporate a garbage collector for the reasons Chu describes.
[14:05:28] <ormaaj> interpreters commonly manage a vitrual call stack on the heap with dynamically allocated references to objects. Everything about the language can be totally abstracted from  the interpreter process's internals.
[14:06:01] <ormaaj> Not applicable
[14:06:18] <tirnanog> yet, the question concerned an actual implementation.
[14:07:02] <tirnanog> the implication that a garbage collector isn't implemented for the reasons given in the post rings true to me. it makes things simpler, at least.
[14:08:05] <ormaaj> It's totally irrelevent.

[16:01:44] <whyglobaleyes> I can do the stage of parsing through the ttf filenames in the /usr/share/fonts/<subdirectories>
[16:01:56] <han-solo> not exactly a bash question, but alright. There seems to be `pdffonts` tool from `poppler` which seems to do that, also when i check SO `strings yourPDFfilepath.pdf | grep FontName`
[16:02:52] <whyglobaleyes> The bit I don't have any idea about is ... how to programmatically (?use PS) to output using the different fonts
[16:03:12] <han-solo> PS ?
[16:03:21] <whyglobaleyes> PS - postscript
[16:03:22] <tirnanog> postscript. this goes way beyond bash, I think.
[16:03:37] <tirnanog> in any case, pdffonts looks good as concerns the initial question.
[16:03:47] <han-solo> ah
[16:04:55] <Earnestly> tirnanog: They don't want to list the fonts used in a pdf

[17:54:53] <aod> the sum of the size from `find ./ *.sh`
[17:55:13] <phy1729> file sizes?
[17:55:22] <aod> yes
[17:55:39] <phy1729> also are you using bash or targeting POSIX sh?
[17:56:01] <aod> bash
[17:56:12] <phy1729> !extglob
[17:56:12] <greybot> "Extended globs" (shopt -s extglob) allow you to say things like "all files that do not end in .jpg". See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/glob#extglob
[17:56:47] <Earnestly> wat
[17:56:48] <phy1729> there's a du flag to sum, so that plus extglobs and you don't need find at all
[17:57:29] <aod> them just `ls`?
[17:57:40] <aod> ok
[17:57:44] <phy1729> no
[17:57:47] <phy1729> !ls
[17:57:47] <greybot> DO NOT USE ls' output for anything. ls is a tool for interactively looking at directory metadata. Any attempts at parsing ls' output with code are broken. Globs are much more simple AND correct: ''for file in *.txt''. Read http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ParsingLs
[17:57:55] <aod> `du`?
[17:57:55] <Earnestly> It would be nice if du could do that, but -s only applies to each argument and only makes sense in the context of a directory

[18:00:20] <Earnestly> Have to use GNU find with -printf and awk to sum it
[18:01:02] <Earnestly> And then you have another issue, which is that du and find printf don't show file size, but blocks

[21:34:42] <Filystyn> the *bug*

[21:35:26] <Filystyn> if false; then var='ua'; else unset var; fi; getpage "gazeta.pl" "$var"

[21:35:49] <Filystyn>  if false; then var='ua'; else unset var; fi; getpage "gazeta.pl" $var
[21:36:28] <lopid> you don't want getpage.pl to know that var was passed?
[21:36:36] <Filystyn> yes
[21:36:41] <Earnestly> Filystyn: Have you considered using set?  Clearly getpage expects a non-empty argument but you're provding one anyway.  With set (or an array) you can provide only the arguments you need
[21:36:44] <gnoo> if it's just one or two, you can use ${var+"$var"} else use a array
[21:36:46] <Filystyn> qoutes seem to pass empty string
[21:37:01] <lopid> "$var" with an empty var is ""
[21:37:28] <Earnestly> Filystyn: Without quotes it does wordsplitting and evaluates to nothing, that's why it appears to work, getpage only sees one argument
[21:37:30] <Filystyn> so why is qouting so imprtant maybe I can just not qoute in this case
[21:37:37] <gnoo> # f() { printf 'no of args: %s\n' "$#" ; } ; var1=a var3=b ; f "$var1" ${var2+"$var2"} "$var3"
[21:37:38] <shbot> gnoo: no of args: 2
[21:37:38] <Filystyn> those are simply commands like -c -e and  url
[21:37:42] <Earnestly> Filystyn: But that's not ideal because now you have an implicit split() over $var
[21:38:01] <lopid> if you don't want to pass var in some circumstances, don't pass it
[21:38:01] <Earnestly> Filystyn: Instead use an array to store the argument vector, or set to build "$@", or use PEs as gnoo demonstrates
[21:38:08] <gnoo> # f() { printf 'no of args: %s\n' "$#" ; } ; var1=a var3=b var2='a b c'; f "$var1" ${var2+"$var2"} "$var3"
[21:38:09] <shbot> gnoo: no of args: 3
[21:38:19] <gnoo> see, no wordsplit over 'a b c'
[21:38:21] <Earnestly> You can even use PEs to set the UA without using if/else with unset and such

[23:54:47] <tirnanog> that is, include a file from within the location so that your problem is reduced to writing out the root path to said file rather than performing a flakey search and replace operation.
[23:56:19] <Earnestly> I'm surprised nginx doesn't have a tool for editting its own configs
[23:56:21] <tirnanog> within the server, I mean. or, at the very least, move the server definition to a distinctly included file.
[23:56:24] <Earnestly> Like postfix does

[23:58:09] <tirnanog> make the "so many root" problem go away, in essence.
[23:58:13] <Earnestly> There is https://github.com/nginxinc/crossplane
[23:58:23] <Earnestly> Which I suppose means you can edit it with jq
[23:58:29] <tirnanog> how on earth do you find these things.
[23:58:54] <Abdullah> maybe Google dorks ;-)
